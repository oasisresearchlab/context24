Identification of the Two Major Epidermal Growth Factor - induced Tyrosine Phosphorylation Sites in the Microvillar Core Protein Ezrin * ( Received for publication , May 19 , 1992 ) Joachim KriegS and Tony Hunter8 From the Molecular Biology and Virology Laboratory , The Salk Institute , Sun Diego , California 92186 In response to epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) the microvillar core protein ezrin is phosphorylated tran - siently to a high level on tyrosine residues in human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells . Here we report the identification of the tyrosine phosphorylation sites in ezrin using bacterially expressed protein as a substrate for in vitro phosphorylation with the EGF receptor . The two major phosphotyrosine - containing peptides observed in vivo were also phosphorylated in vitro . By secondary digestions and site - directed mutagenesis ty - rosines 145 and 353 were identified as the sites of phosphorylation . One of the sites , Tyr146 , lies in the N - terminal region of homology that is common to the band 4 . 1 - talin - ezrin protein family . This tyrosine res - idue and its vicinal amino acids are conserved through - out the family members , including radixin , moesin , and the two phosphotyrosine phosphatases , PTP H1 and PTP MEG , but not in band 4 . 1 or talin . Tyr353 is localized within the a - helical domain of ezrin and com - parison of the protein sequences reveals that this site is unique to ezrin . Protein - tyrosine phosphorylation has been implicated in the control of many cellular processes , including normal and neoplastic cell growth ( 1 ) . The activation of growth factor receptor and nonreceptor protein - tyrosine kinases , and con - sequent phosphorylation of cytoplasmic substrates , initiates many of these events . Protein - tyrosine phosphatases clearly play a crucial role in maintaining the normal low basal phos - photyrosine levels in the resting cell . However , the identifi - cation of receptor - like tyrosine phosphatases suggests that they may also initiate signal transduction pathways in re - sponse to as yet unknown extracellular signals ( 2 , 3 ) . Although the number of these regulatory protein - tyrosine kinases and phosphatases has been growing rapidly , the number of iden - tified and characterized substrates is still small . This includes the human homolog of the yeast cell cycle control gene , cdc2 ( 4 ) , c - Raf ( 5 ) , phosphatidylinositol 3 " kinase ( 6 , 7 ) , phospho - lipase C - 71 ( 8 , 9 ) , Ras GTPase activator protein ( GAP ) ( lo ) , lactate dehydrogenase , phosphoglycerate mutase and enolase ( 11 ) , talin ( 12 ) , vinculin ( 13 ) , paxillin ( 14 ) , band 4 . 1 ( 15 ) , * This work was supported by United States Public Health Service Grant CA - 39780 .

In order to evaluate the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins to cellular phenotype , it is necessary to understand their structure and function and ultimately the effect of phosphorylation on their function . Unlike other cytoskeletal protein - tyrosine kinase sub - strates , ezrin was identified as a substrate indirectly . In one of the early studies searching for substrates using two - dimen - sional gel electrophoresis , a tyrosine - phosphorylated 81 - kDa protein was detected following EGF ' treatment of human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells ( 27 ) . Phosphotyrosine - con - taining p81 was also detected in both Rous sarcoma virus ( RSV ) and Snyder - Theilen feline sarcoma virus ( ST - FeSV ) - transformed A431 cells , which express the pp60 " " " and P85gag - fes protein - tyrosine kinases , respectively ( 28 , 29 ) . Subsequently , p81 was shown to be identical to ezrin , which is an 80 - kDa component of chicken intestinal microvilli ( 16 , 30 ) . Ezrin is localized to microvilli and other plasma mem - brane structures in a wide variety of cell types , and it parti - tions in biochemical fractionation experiments as if it is associated with or is part of the cytoskeleton ( 30 , 35 ) . EGF stimulation of A431 cells causes the formation of microspikes and microvilli leading to membrane ruffling after 2 - 5 min and ultimately induces the rounding up of these cells . Ezrin is localized to the cores of these microvillar structures . Ezrin is constitutively phosphorylated on serine and threonine , and EGF treatment leads to an increase in tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation with kinetics that parallel the EGF - stimu - lated morphological changes ( 16 , 31 ) . More than 10 % of ezrin is phosphorylated on tyrosine after treatment of A431 cells for 10 min with EGF ( 16 ) , and the level of tyrosine phos - phorylation may be even higher at earlier times ( 31 ) . This is a reasonably high stoichiometry for a tyrosine phosphoryla - tion event ( typically values range from 10 to 50 % ) , particu - larly since only a fraction of the ezrin population in the cell is localized to the microvillar structures . Taken together these observations raise the possibility that ezrin tyrosine phos - phorylation might play a physiological role in regulating cell surface cytoskeletal rearrangements in response to EGF . Several other proteins related to ezrin have been identified . First , cytovillin , a 75 - kDa protein identified using antibodies to a retrovirus - related peptide , was localized to the apical membrane of human choriocarcinoma cells , JEG - 3 , and shown by immunoelectron microscopy to be localized within a few nanometers of the lipid bilayer between the microvillar The abbreviations used are : EGF , epidermal growth factor ; RSV , Rous sarcoma virus ; ST - FeSV , Snyder - Theilen feline sarcoma virus ; DTT , dithiothreitol ; SDS , sodium dodecyl sulfate ; HEPES , N - 2 - hydroxyethylpiperazine - N " 2 - ethanesulfonic acid . 19258 Ezrin Tyrosine Phosphorylation Sites 19259 membrane and the microfilaments ( 32 ) . Recently , it has been shown by both immunological cross - reactivity and cDNA sequencing that placental cytovillin and intestinal ezrin are identical ( 33 , 34 ) . Second , a gastric 80 - kDa phosphoprotein , which was localized to the apical microvilli of parietal cells and becomes phosphorylated on serines residues during CAMP - mediated stimulation , has now been shown to be closely homologous to ezrin ( 35 ) . The histamine - stimulated increase in CAMP is reduced by EGF , raising the possibility that tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein may be involved in the regulation of acid secretion in gastric glands . Finally , the antigen of a monoclonal antibody ( 13H9 ) was found to have several properties similar to ezrin and was shown to be closely related if not identical to ezrin ( 36 , 37 ) . This protein displays characteristics of both a microtubule - and a micro - filament - associated protein in the marginal band of nucleated chicken erythrocytes ( 36 ) and also colocalizes with F - actin in growth cones of primary neurons , in a manner which depends upon microtubules . Protein and cDNA sequence analysis have defined a family of proteins , including band 4 . 1 , talin , and ezrin , that partici - pate in the interaction between the membrane and cytoskel - eton ( 38 ) . There is a high degree of identity among these three proteins within a 200 - 300 amino acid stretch at their N termini ( Fig . lA ) . The binding site of human erythrocyte protein 4 . 1 to the transmembrane protein glycophorin has been mapped to this region of homology ( 39 , 40 ) . Talin binds with low affinity to the a & integrin , but it is not known through which domain the binding occurs ( 41 ) . For ezrin no interaction with other proteins has been reported so far , despite extensive efforts to find such interactions . Secondary structure predictions indicate that to the C - terminal side of their related N - terminal domains all three proteins have a long a - helical domain followed by a highly charged region . In band 4 . 1 , the latter portion of the a - helical domain is respon - sible for spectrin binding ( 42 ) . In talin the a - helical domain - A ” . . . . EZRlN 85 % / / / / m PlOESlN 85 % . . . . . RADIXIN 35 % P BAND 4 I containing 190 - kDa fragment binds to vinculin ( 43 ) . By anal - ogy it has been suggested that ezrin also binds to a cytoskeletal protein via its a - helical domain and interacts with a mem - brane - associated protein through its homologous N terminus ( 34 , 38 ) . Recently the cDNA sequences of four other proteins have been reported that have homology with this N - terminal region ( Fig . lA ) . Two of these cDNAs encode for proteins that are closely related to human ezrin . Human moesin ( 44 ) and mouse radixin ( 45 ) are 73 and 75 % , respectively , identical to the entire ezrin protein sequence . However , this identity is great - est within the N - terminal 300 amino acids , being 85 % . Both proteins contain an a - helical domain C - terminal to the first 300 amino acids followed by a highly charged region . Radixin is reported to be an actin barbed - end capping protein , which is highly concentrated in the undercoat of cell - to - cell adherens junctions ( 46 ) . During mitosis this protein is then localized to the cleavage furrow ( 45 ) . For moesin there is so far no detailed immunological localization available , but its subcel - lular distribution is reported to be similar to ezrin ( 44 , 47 ) . The other two cDNAs encode for protein - tyrosine phospha - tases termed PTP H1 ( 48 ) and PTP MEG ( 49 ) . They are 54 % identical to each other , and each has 30 % sequence identity to the N - terminal 300 amino acids of ezrin . Unlike the other members of the band 4 . 1 - talin - ezrin , family these two proteins contain a single protein - tyrosine phosphatase domain at the C terminus . The central segment of 300 amino acids between the related N - terminal region and the catalytic domain did not display homology with any sequence in the data base . Because tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin may play a phys - iological role in regulating cell surface cytoskeletal re - arrangements in response to EGF , we set out to map the tyrosine phosphorylation sites in ezrin . For this purpose , we expressed a human ezrin cDNA in bacteria and showed that it was phosphorylated by the EGF receptor in vitro at both the tyrosines that are phosphorylated in ezrin in vivo in B IS I 1111 111 I 11 - . . . . . . . . . . .

Structural models of the 7 members of the band 4 . 1 - talin - ezrin family and depiction of bacterially - expressed ezrin molecules . A , the structures of ezrin , moesin , radixin , band 4 . 1 , talin , and the two protein - tyrosine phosphatases PTP HI and PTP MEG are shown schematically . Each protein has a related N - terminal domain ( black box ) with an identity to ezrin as indicated . In ezrin , moesin , radixin , band 4 . 1 , and talin , this region is followed by a domain rich in a - helices ( hatched boxes ; different shading indicates that these domains are not related ) . The C - terminal segments ( checkered boxes ) of these five proteins are highly charged , but only the sequences of ezrin , moesin , and radixin are related . The catalytic domain at the C - terminus of PTP H1 and PTP MEG are shown as cross - hatched boxes . Regions with no similarity are indicated by open rectangles . The hatched box in talin is interrupted to indicate that the length of the ru - helical domain should be twice as long as indicated . I ? , the four bacterially expressed ezrin proteins are shown . To express these proteins , DNA fragments were excised from the human ezrin cDNA ( 34 ) and ligated into the pRSET plasmid for expression in E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) as a fusion protein with the gene 10 protein of bacteriophage T7 . The first three constructs were used to identify the tyrosine phosphorylation sites of ezrin , whereas with the last construct the two identified tyrosines were verified by converting their codons to phenylalanine ( for details see “Experimental Procedures” ) . The positions of the tyrosine residues of ezrin are indicated by the short vertical lines on top of the constructs . In the last construct only Tyr“s and T y P are marked . The horizontal lines with the small digit on top indicate the number of amino acids added from the gene 10 protein of bacteriophage T7 to the ezrin molecules . 19260 Ezrin Tyrosine Phosphorylation Sites response to EGF . We have identified these tyrosines as Tyr ' 45 and Tyr353 . One of the sites , T Y ~ ' ~ ~ , lies in the region of homology which is common to the band 4 . 1 - talin - ezrin protein family . This tyrosine residue and its neighboring amino acids are conserved in all the family members except band 4 . 1 and talin . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES DNA Constructs and Bacterial Expression - To express the human ezrin cDNA ( 34 ) in Escherichia coli the vector set pRSET 6A , 6B , and 6C was used . ' In short the pRSET vectors are derived from the PET vector ( 50 ) by addition of a multiple restriction site linker and 1 or 2 additional base pairs upstream of this linker so that the appr0priat . e plasmid for in frame insertion of the target DNA can be chosen . Expression of the DNA yields a fusion protein of the target protein with the gene 10 product of bacteriophage T7 . The following four DNA fragments were excised from the ezrin cDNA and cloned into pRSET 6B ( i , ii , iv ) or pRSET 6C ( iii ) ( see also Fig . 1B ) : ( i ) a 2520 - base pair NcoI - NcoI fragment encoding ezrin Met " - Le ~ ~ * ~ , ( ii ) an 812 - base pair NcoI - PstI fragment encoding Met1 ' - GlnZs1 , ( iii ) a 655 - base pair KpnI - SstI fragment encoding Le ~ ' " - Leu ~ ~ ~ , and ( iv ) an 815 - base pair SstI - SstI fragment encoding Ileg3 - Leu364 . All subcloning steps were carried out in the E . coli strain C600 . The expression plasmid was subsequently transformed into the strain BL21 ( DE3 ) , which also carries the pLysS plasmid ( 51 ) . Transform - ants were selected with ampicillin and chloramphenicol . To express the fusion protein , bacteria were grown to an OD600 of 0 . 5 at 37 " C in LB containing 50 pg / ml ampicillin and 25 pg / ml chloramphenicol . Isopropyl - 1 - thio - 0 - D - galactopyranoside was added to a final concen - tration of 0 . 4 mM . After 3 h , the bacteria were pelleted and resus - pended in 6 ml of lysis buffer ( 100 mM NaC1 , 1 mM EDTA , 50 mM Tris - C1 , pH S . O ) / g of bacteria . The cells were sonicated with two 15 - s bursts of an ultrasonicator ( Ultrasonic Inc , model W - 225 ) at setting 7 ( 90 % duty cycle ) and left at room temperature for 15 min . The inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation at 10 , 000 rpm for 20 min at 4 " C and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 and 10 mM EDTA . After repelleting the inclusion bodies by centrifugation the proteins were solubilized in 1 X sample buffer ( 143 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) , 10 % glycerol , 63 mM Tris - C1 , pH 6 . 8 ) by boiling and separated on a 15 % SDS - polyacrylamide gel . The fusion protein was electroeluted from the gel overnight in 0 . 1 % SDS , 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate , pH 8 . 0 . To precipitate the protein the solution was made 15 % in trichlo - roacetic acid . The pellet was washed twice with 100 % ethanol and air - dried . The protein was solubilized in 8 M urea , 50 mM Tris - C1 , pH 7 . 5 , overnight at 4 " C . The urea was removed by dialysis against 15 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , and the protein concentration adjusted to 0 . 3 mg / ml . The renatured protein is soluble but precipitates upon freezing and thawing . Site - directed Mutagenesis - The 815 - base pair SstI - SstI fragment , consisting of residues 396 - 1211 of the human cDNA , was cloned into M13 mp18 . Positive clones were identified , and the orientation of the insert was determined by means of conventional techniques ( 52 ) . To make the F - 145 , F - 353 and F - 145 + F - 353 mutants , the two oligonu - cleotides 5 ' - AGA GCT GAG GAA CCC AGA CTT - 3 ' and 5 ' - CTT CTC CTC AAA GTC CTG CAG - 3 ' were synthesized on a model 8750 DNA synthesizer ( Milligen / Biosearch , San Rafael , California ) . Mutagenesis reactions were carried out by using an oligonucleotide - directed in uitro mutagenesis system ( Amersham International plc , Amersham , United Kingdom ) as specified by the manufacturer . Mu - tant clones were screened by sequencing . The three individual mu - tated SstI - SstI fragments were cloned into the pRSET 6B plasmid and expressed in E . coli as described above . Biosynthetic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation - Subconfluent A431 cells were labeled by incubation with 1 mCi / ml [ 32P ] orthophos - phate ( ICN Radiochemicals , Irvine , CA ) at 37 " C for 16 - 18 h in phosphate - free Dulbecco ' s modified Eagle ' s medium supplemented with 4 % dialyzed fetal calf serum . Where indicated , EGF ( Collabo - rative Research Inc . , Lexington , MA ) was added at 100 ng / ml for 4 min at the end of the labeling period . Cells were washed three times with cold Tris - buffered saline before solubilization in 200 p1 of SDS lysis buffer ( 0 . 5 % SDS , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , 1 % Trasylol , 10 mM Na ' HPO , , pH 7 . 2 ) / 90 - mm dish . The cell lysate was boiled for 5 min and diluted with 800 p1 of SDS - free DTT - supplemented RIPA - ' R . Schopfer , unpublished data . VFE buffer ( 150 mM NaC1 , 5 mM DTT , 10 mM Na2HPOI , pH 7 . 2 , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 0 . 1 % sodium deoxycholate , 1 % Trasylol , 0 . 1 mM Na3V04 , 50 mM NaF , 2 mM EDTA ) . The lysate was precleared by incubation with 50 pl of Pansorbin ( Calbiochem ) and centrifugation at 29 , 000 X g for 20 min at 4 " C . Immunoprecipitations were per - formed with a polyclonal anti - ezrin serum , which was raised by immunizing a rabbit with the bacterially expressed ezrin Le ~ ' * ' j - Leu ~ ~ ~ ( see above , construct iii ) . Lysates were incubated with 25 pl of this antiserum for 1 h on ice , followed by a 1 - h incubation with 375 p1 of Pansorbin . The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with RIPA - VFE buffer . Proteins were released from the particles by boiling for 5 min in 1 X sample buffer and analyzed on a 7 . 5 % SDS - polyacrylamide gel as described previously ( 53 ) . In Vitro Kinase Reactions - The affinity - purified A431 - derived EGF receptor ( 12 ng / pl ) was a gift of G . Gill ( University of California , San Diego ) . The receptor ( 1 pl ) was preincubated for 10 min on ice in 20 pl of 6 mM MnCl ' , 0 . 05 mM Na3V04 , 1 mM DTT , 37 . 5 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 . After addition of 10 pl of 10 pCi / pl [ T - ~ ' P ] ATP ( 4500 Ci / mmol ; ICN Radiochemicals ) and 10 pl of bacterially ex - pressed ezrin , the reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30 " C . The reaction was stopped by adding 10 pl of 5 X sample buffer . After boiling for 5 min , the reaction mixture was analyzed on a 15 % polyacrylamide gel . Affinity - purified pp6OC ~ " " from infected Sf9 cells was a gift from M . Broome ( Salk Institute ) and was used under identical conditions for phosphorylation of ezrin as described above . Peptide Mapping and Phosphoamino Acid Analysis - The ezrin molecules were isolated from the gel and digested with trypsin as described previously ( 54 ) . Phosphopeptides were separated in two dimensions on 100 - mm cellulose thin - layer plates by electrophoresis at pH 1 . 9 ( 50 parts 88 % formic acid , 156 parts glacial acetic acid , 1794 parts water ) for 30 min at 1 kV followed by ascending chroma - tography ( 150 parts glacial acetic acid , 500 parts pyridine , 600 parts water , 750 parts n - butanol ) ( 55 ) . Peptides were visualized by autora - diography . For further analysis the phosphopeptides were isolated from the thin - layer plates and subjected to phosphoamino acid analy - sis , manual Edman degradation , or secondary digestions with ther - molysin , endoproteinase Glu - C ( V8 ) , or endoproteinase Asp - N ( Pseu - domonas fragi ) ( 56 ) . To determine if a phosphopeptide is susceptible to cyanogen bromide ( CNBr ) cleavage , the 3 ' P - labeled fragments of ezrin were first cleaved with 5 pl of a 2 . 5 M CNBr solution dissolved in 70 % formic acid by incubation overnight at room temperature and , after oxidation with performic acid , digested with trypsin . The re - sulting phosphopeptides were analyzed either alone or mixed with the isolated phosphopeptide for comigration by two - dimensional pep - tide mapping . Peptide mobilities were predicted as described ( 56 ) . RESULTS EGF Induces Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Ezrin at Several Sites in Vivo - To investigate the phosphorylation sites of ezrin , 32P - labeled ezrin was immunoprecipitated from subcon - fluent A431 cells labeled with 32P and analyzed by two - dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping . As reported earlier ( 16 ) , tryptic digestion of ezrin from untreated cells generates three major phosphopeptides termed 1 , 2 , and 3 ( Fig . 2 A ) . Peptides 1 and 2 contained only phosphothreonine , whereas phosphopeptide 3 contained phosphothreonine and phosphoserine . When ezrin was isolated from cells that had been stimulated for 4 min with EGF at 37 " C , besides peptides 1 - 3 , two major new phosphopeptides were observed termed 4 and 5 ( Fig . 2B ) . Both peptides contained exclusively phos - photyrosine . Several minor phosphotyrosine - containing pep - tides were found , and two of the more prominent are indicated by arrowheads . Peptide Maps of in Vivo and in Vitro Labeled Ezrin Have Several Phosphopeptides in Common - To test the possibility that the EGF receptor directly phosphorylates ezrin , human ezrin was expressed in bacteria using the pRSET gene 10 fusion vector system . The insoluble protein was solubilized and resolved by SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . The ezrin band was eluted and renatured as described under " Ex - perimental Procedures " and used as a substrate for in vitro phosphorylation with affinity - purified A431 - derived EGF Ezrin Tyrosine Phosphorylation Sites 19261 FIG . 2 .

Ezrin was immunoprecipitated with anti - ezrin serum from : " P - labeled subconfluent A431 cells , either treated for 4 min with EGF or not , and isolated as described under " Experimental Procedures . " Bacterially expressed human ezrin was phosphorylated with the EGF receptor , separated by polyacrylamide electrophoresis , and isolated as described under " Experimental Procedures . " After tryptic digestion the resultant peptides were separated in two dimensions . Electrophoresis was performed at pH 1 . 9 in the horizontal dimension for 30 min at 1 kV with the anode on the left and ascending chromatography in the vertical dimension . In each case the origin is indicated by an arrow . Arrowheads denote minor phosphopeptides discussed in the text .

Cerenkov counts / min loaded onto thin - layer plates were 800 cpm ( A ) , 1400 cpm ( R ) , and 5000 cpm ( C ) . Exposure times were 6 days for A and B and 18 h for C at - 70 " C with an intensifying screen . receptor . " Full - length " ezrin Met " - LeusSs lacks only the N - terminal 10 amino acids , which do not contain a tyrosine , and these are replaced by 18 gene 10 - derived residues , which also lack tyrosine ( Fig . 1B ) . Ezrin Met " - LeuSRs was phosphoryl - ated exclusively on tyrosine residues , but the stoichiometry of phosphorylation never exceeded 0 . 01 mol of phosphate / mol of protein . The low in vitro phosphorylation stoichiometry is very likely due to the fact that most of the bacterially ex - pressed ezrin did not adopt a native conformation after puri - fication by SDS - gel electrophoresis and renaturation from 8 M urea . Although our failure to obtain complete renaturation is a limitation on using this source of ezrin for functional assays , recombinant ezrin proved to be ideal for identifying the tyrosine phosphorylation sites , because peptide mapping showed that physiological sites could readily be phosphoryl - ated ( see below ) . Tryptic peptide mapping of in vitro phosphorylated ezrin Met ' ' - Leu " " showed that the two major in vivo sites , peptides 4 and 5 , were also phosphorylated by the EGF receptor in vitro ( Fig . 2C ) . This result was confirmed by comigration experiments of the two isolated phosphopeptides with those from in vivo labeled ezrin ( data not shown ) . The minor in vivo phosphorylation sites indicated by the upper left and lower right arrowheads in Fig . 2B may correspond to one of the peptides with similar migration obtained following in vitro phosphorylation , but this was not confirmed by comigration . At least one peptide observed in the in vitro phosphorylated ezrin Met " - Leu " ' was not detected in in vivo labeled ezrin . This peptide may have resulted from phosphorylation of incompletely renatured molecules . Ezrin Met ' I - Leu " ' was also phosphorylated in vitro on tyrosine by pp60 " " " , but the tryptic phosphopeptide map did not show any similarity with the in vivo derived map ( data not shown ) . The Two Major Etrin Phosphorylation Sites in Vivo Are Tyr ' " and Tyr : ' " ' - - To determine which of the 19 tyrosine residues in ezrin are phosphorylated , smaller fragments of ezrin were expressed in bacteria , purified , renatured , and phosphorylated with the EGF receptor . The N - terminal Met " - Gln " ' fragment and an internal Le ~ " ~ - Leu " ' fragment ( see Fig . 1B ) were chosen for these initial experiments . When ezrin Le ~ ' ~ ' - - Leu : ' ' ~ was phosphorylated by the EGF receptor , one major tryptic phosphopeptide was observed with a mobil - ity similar to peptide 5 ( Fig . 3A ) , whereas with ezrin Met ' ' - Gln % H ' two phosphopeptides were found migrating close to peptide 4 ( Fig . 4A ) . By comigration with peptides from in vivo labeled ezrin , we showed that the single major phospho - peptide of ezrin Le ~ ' ' ~ - Leu " ' comigrated with phosphopep - tide 5 ( Fig . 3C ) . Of the two phosphopeptides derived from ezrin Met " - GlnZR1 the lower peptide comigrated with peptide 4 of in vivo labeled ezrin ( Fig . 4C ) , whereas the upper peptide was not observed in vivo ( Fig . 4B ) . The additional peptides from the in vitro phosphorylated ezrin fragments ( Figs . 3A and 4A ) may also have resulted from phosphorylation of incompletely renatured molecules and in the case of ezrin Le ~ ' ' ~ - Leu " ' from a tyrosine in the gene 10 leader . From these results it appears that each of the two ezrin fragments contains one of the two in vivo phosphorylation sites . As the two constructs share a overlapping region from Leu ' 46 to Gln2 * ' , we deduced that the 5 tyrosines in this region of overlap were not phosphorylated ( Table I , category C ) . The nonov - erlapping region of ezrin Met " - GlnZ8 ' contains 7 tyrosines in five theoretical tryptic peptides ( Table I , category A ) as pos - sible phosphorylation sites for peptide 4 . In the nonoverlap - ping region of ezrin L e ~ ' ~ ~ - L e u " ~ there are 2 tyrosines in two peptides left as candidates for peptide 5 ( Table I , category B ) . Only the predicted mobilities of ezrin tryptic peptides 20 and 62 are compatible with the observed mobility of peptides 4 and 5 . To characterize the two phosphorylation sites further , peptides 4 and 5 were isolated from peptide maps of the two in vitro labeled ezrin fragments and digested with endopro - teinases Asp - N ( P . fragi ) , Glu - C ( V8 ) , or thermolysin or with CNBr or were subjected to six cycles of manual Edman degradation . Only two candidate peptides have all the prop - erties summarized for peptides 4 and 5 in Table 11 . For peptide 4 , this is peptide 20 containing Tyrl ' ' , and for peptide 5 , this is peptide 62 containing Tyr " : ' . Site - directed Mutagenesis of Ezrin - To confirm the phos - phopeptide mapping data , the codons for T Y ~ ' ' ~ and Tyi ' " were changed to phenylalanine either singly or in combination by site - directed mutagenesis . A fragment of ezrin from Ile9 : ' to Leu " " containing these mutations was expressed in E . coli . The isolated wild type and mutant Ileg3 - Leu : ' " ' fragments were phosphorylated with the EGF receptor and analyzed by tryp - tic peptide mapping . With the wild type fragment both pep - tides 4 and 5 were generated ( Fig . 5A ) , whereas with the doubly - mutated protein F145 + F353 these peptides were ab - sent ( Fig . 5B ) . In the singly - mutated protein F145 peptide 4 was no longer visible but peptide 5 was still observed ( Fig . 19262 Ezrin Tyrosine Phosphorylation Sites FIG . 3 .

From these results we conclude that tyrosines 145 and 353 , contained in the in vivo phosphopeptides 4 and 5 , are the two major tyrosine phosphorylation sites for the EGF receptor in ezrin . Tyrosine 145 Is Conserved in Several Proteins of the Protein 4 . 1 - Talin - Ezrin Family - As T y P lies in a region of ezrin that has considerable sequence identity to other members of the protein 4 . 1 - talin - ezrin family , we were interested to know if this phosphorylation site is conserved in the other proteins . Fig . 6 shows the alignment of the protein sequences of the seven family members so far known . This tyrosine is present in all the proteins with the exception of talin , where it is replaced by a phenylalanine . In moesin , radixin , phosphoty - rosine phosphatase HI , phosphotyrosine phosphatase MEG , and talin , the adjacent amino acids are conserved , whereas in protein 4 . 1 the 2 vicinal amino acids are substituted . It is also worth noting that at positions 15 and 11 to the N - terminal side of this tyrosine , there is a conserved glutamine and glycine , respectively , and at position 8 to the C - terminal side there is a conserved proline . DISCUSSION In this study we describe the identification of the two major tyrosine phosphorylation sites of ezrin whose phosphorylation is induced by EGF treatment of A431 cells . Tyr145 and TyrZSC3 were identified as phosphorylation sites using bacterially ex - pressed ezrin as a substrate for phosphorylation by the EGF receptor in uitro . The ability of the purified EGF receptor to phosphorylate the same tyrosines as those phosphorylated in ezrin from EGF - treated A431 cells favors the idea that ezrin is phosphorylated by the EGF receptor in vivo . This possibility is consistent with earlier studies where the EGF receptor and ezrin appear to be colocalized in A431 cell surface structures . In unstimulated cells a featureless and random distribution of ezrin and the EGF receptor has been reported ( 31 , 571 , whereas 1 min after EGF addition both proteins were localized to large microvilli ( 31 , 58 ) . In our earlier work ( 16 ) only one of the two phosphotyro - sine - containing peptides detected here was observed ( peptide 4 ) . This difference may be due to the shorter EGF treatment we have used here ( 4 versus 10 min ) coupled with the 2 - fold higher concentration of EGF . We chose to use the shorter treatment time , because subsequent work showed that maxi - mal total phosphorylation of ezrin occurs 2 - 5 min after ad - dition of EGF to A431 cells and declines rapidly thereafter ( 31 ) . The observed decrease of phosphorylation after 5 min substantiates the possibility that peptide 5 was missed in our earlier study due to the longer incubation time with EGF . It should be noted , however , that in RSV - or ST - FeSV - trans - formed A431 cells EGF stimulates phosphorylation of peptide 5 , and this increase is detected even after 10 min of EGF stimulation suggesting that the transformation event is inducing or stabilizing the phosphorylation of peptide 5 . In pp60 " " " - expressing A431 cells peptides 4 and 5 were only weakly phosphorylated in untreated cells , whereas in Ezrin Tyrosine Phosphorylation Sites 19263 TABLE I Predicted tyrosine - containing tryptic peptides of ezrin The theoretical tyrosine - containing tryptic peptides of ezrin , gen - erated by cutting the sequence at the C - terminal side of lysine and arginine , are listed in four categories ( A - D ) based on reasons de - scribed under " Results .

L . Gould , unpublished results . cells ( 28 , 29 ) . The persistent tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin in ST - FeSV - transformed A431 cells could be due to their production of transforming growth factor a ( TGFa ) , which binds and activates the EGF receptor ( 26 ) , or to direct phos - phorylation by P85g " g - fe " . The fact that the tyrosines phos - phorylated in ezrin by pp60 " - " " did not correspond to those phosphorylated by the EGF receptor suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin in RSV - transformed cells could also be an indirect effect ( 28 , 59 ) . The phosphorylation site in peptide 5 was identified as Tyr353 , which resides in a region of ezrin predicted to form a long a - helix of 150 - 180 amino acids starting at residue 290 near the middle of the molecule ( Fig . L4 ) . Similar a - helical regions are common to the C - terminal halves of band 4 . 1 , talin , radixin , and moesin , and it is thought that the binding site of distinct cytoskeletal proteins are localized to this region . Comparison of the protein sequence of the Tyr " " " phosphorylation site reveals that the equivalent tyrosine res - idue and the adjacent N - terminal amino acids in moesin and radixin are not conserved . Nevertheless , within this region moesin and radixin are 56 and 62 % , respectively , identical to ezrin , and therefore even though the phosphorylation site is not conserved , they may bind to the same cytoskeletal protein . In band 4 . 1 and talin no sequence similarity is found in this region of the proteins , suggesting that they bind to different cytoskeletal proteins than ezrin . Interestingly tyrosine phos - phorylation of band 4 . 1 has been reported recently ( 15 ) , and the phosphorylation site was localized to an 8 - kDa domain , which is the binding site of spectrin and localized in the latter part of the a - helical region . The 8 - kDa domain contains only 1 tyrosine , Tyr418 . Phosphorylation of this site by the EGF receptor reduced the ability of band 4 . 1 to promote the assem - bly of the spectrin - actin - band 4 . 1 ternary complex . Remark - ably only the erythroid form of protein 4 . 1 contains the 21 - amino acid sequence ( amino acids 407 - 427 ) where this phos - phorylation site has been localized . By analogy it is possible that the binding of an unknown cytoskeletal protein to ezrin is regulated by phosphorylation / dephosphorylation of Tyr " " . In contrast to peptide 5 , phosphorylation of peptide 4 at Tyr ' 45 persists in EGF - treated A431 cells . This tyrosine resi - due and its adjacent amino acids are conserved in four other members of the protein 4 . 1 - talin - ezrin family , namely moesin , radixin , PTP H1 , and PTP MEG ( Fig . 6 ) , and it is tempting to speculate that these proteins are also phosphorylated at this site . In band 4 . 1 the homologous tyrosine is conserved but the neighboring glycine , and leucine residues are substi - tuted by aspartic acid and valine , respectively . If primary structural determinants are important for site recognition by the protein - tyrosine kinase , then band 4 . 1 would be unlikely to be phosphorylated at this tyrosine . Indeed no tyrosine phosphorylation has been reported so far in this region of band 4 . 1 . Talin is known to be phosphorylated on tyrosine ( 12 ) , although the sites ( s ) have not been mapped . However , even though the two neighboring amino acids are conserved , the tyrosine corresponding to 145 in talin is a phenylalanine , and therefore talin must be phosphorylated elsewhere . It is unclear how Tyr ' 45 is recognized for phosphorylation . Based on the similarity with moesin , radixin , and the two phosphotyrosine phosphatases , one could argue that a mini - mal requirement for phosphorylation of this site is defined by the sequence glycine - tyrosine - leucine . In addition , an acidic amino acid is present to the C - terminal side of the phos - phorylated tyrosine , and acidic residues are a feature common at the autophosphorylation sites of most protein - tyrosine kinases and in vivo substrates ( 26 ) . However , it has been reported that short synthetic peptides that lack higher order 19264 Ezrin Tyrosine Phosphorylation Sites FIG . 5 .

Protein sequence alignment of the ezrin tyrosine 145 phosphorylation site and the equivalent sites of the other six members of the band 4 . 1 - talin - ezrin family . The sequences in the fikmre are taken from the puhlished sequences of ezrin ( 33 , 34 ) , moesin ( 44 ) , radixin ( 45 ) , PTP H1 ( 48 ) , PTP MEG ( 49 ) , hand 4 . 1 ( GO ) , and talin ( 38 ) . All the sequences are human except radixin and talin , which are murine . structural determinants are poor substrates for protein - tyro - sine kinases , and thus secondary and tertiary structure is likely to be important for the recognition of substrates by protein - tyrosine kinases . In this regard , in all seven proteins of the band 4 . 1 - talin - ezrin family , the positions 11 and 15 N - terminal and the position 8 C - terminal to Tyr ' lS are con - served , which might provide secondary structure recognition . Extensive tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin occurs simul - taneously with cytoskeletal rearrangements in A431 cells after EGF stimulation , and it is possible that the interaction of ezrin with as yet unknown membrane - associated and cyto - skeletal proteins is regulated by this phosphorylation . The identification of the two major tyrosine phosphorylation sites in ezrin substantiates this possibility , as each of the sites is localized to distinct regions of the protein . Tyr ' lS resides in the homologous N - terminal region of the band 4 . 1 - ezrin - talin family , which is thought to interact with membrane - associ - ated proteins , and Tyr : ' " : ' is localized within the a - helical domain , which may interact with cytoskeletal proteins . In erythrocytes the binding of band 4 . 1 to the transmembrane protein glycophorin is regulated in a polyphosphatidylinosi - tol - dependent manner ( 39 ) , and it was suggested that the binding of ezrin to an integral membrane protein may be dependent on this cofactor . However , the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation in the N - terminal region of band 4 . 1 suggests that the binding of band 4 . 1 is not regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of the tyrosine equivalent to 145 . We have attempted to use unphosphorylated bacterially expressed ezrin to identify proteins that interact with ezrin , by using affinity chromatography and overlay assays , but no specific binding of other cellular proteins could be detected . However , it is possible that phosphorylation of ezrin at Tyr ' lS is crucial for such interactions , and therefore these experiments need to be repeated with ezrin phosphorylated in vitro by the EGF receptor . In addition to the observed tyrosine phosphorylations , the phosphorylation of ezrin on serine and threonine could be critical for the structure of ezrin and thereby the binding to other cellular proteins . The availability of the ezrin cDNA and the identification of the two major tyrosine phosphorylation sites will allow genetic manipulations that should enable us to define the function of ezrin in cytoskeletal and membrane organization and to test the function of the tyrosine phosphorylation sites . If phosphorylation of Tyr ' " and Tyr : : ' " ' is essential for cyto - skeletal rearrangements in A431 cells after EGF treatment , the conversion of these 2 residues to phenylalanine should interfere with the induction of membrane ruffling and the appearance of microvilli . and Tyr : K : ' 2 . 1 . 3 . 4 . 5 . 6 . 7 . 8 . 9 . 10 . 11 . 12 . 13 . 14 . 15 . 16 . 17 . 18 . 19 . 20 . 21 . 22 . 23 . 24 . 25 . 26 . 27 .
