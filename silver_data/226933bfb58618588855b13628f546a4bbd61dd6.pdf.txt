Two major endocytic pathways , clathrin - and caveolae - mediated endocytosis , have been reported to independently mediate the internalization of TGF - β receptors . In this study , we demonstrate that the clathrin - and caveolae - mediated endocytic pathways can converge during TGF - β receptor endocytic trafficking . By tracking the intracellular dynamics of fluorescently - labeled TGF - β type I receptor ( TβRI ) , we found that after me - diating TβRI internalization , certain clathrin - coated vesicles and caveolar vesicles are fused underneath the plasma membrane , forming a novel type of caveolin - 1 and clathrin double - positive vesicles . Under the regulation of Rab5 , the fused vesicles are targeted to early endosomes and thus deliver the internalized TβRI to the caveolin - 1 and EEA1 double - positive early endosomes ( caveolin - 1 - positive early endosomes ) . We further showed that the caveolin - 1 - pos - itive early endosomes are positive for Smad3 / SARA , Rab11 and Smad7 / Smurf2 , and may act as a multifunctional device for TGF - β signaling and TGF - β receptor recycling and degradation . Therefore , these findings uncover a novel scenario of endocytosis , the direct fusion of clathrin - coated and caveolae vesicles during TGF - β receptor endocytic trafficking , which leads to the formation of the multifunctional sorting device , caveolin - 1 - positive early endosomes , for TGF - β receptors .

Eukaryotic cells have evolved diverse mechanisms of en - docytosis , which can be divided into clathrin - dependent and - independent pathways . Clathrin - dependent endocy - tosis occurs constitutively in all known eukaryotic cells , defined by a requirement for clathrin and adaptor proteins to form the endocytic vesicle coat [ 2 ] . One of the most important clathrin - independent pathways is mediated by caveolae , which are flask - shaped plasma membrane invaginations marked by the presence of caveolin - 1 [ 1 , 4 ] . Understanding the mechanism of different endocytic pathways and how these pathways are regulated is of critical importance in the study of cell signaling process , especially for transforming growth factor - β ( TGF - β ) sig - Kangmin He et al . 739 npg www . cell - research . com | Cell Research naling , where TGF - β receptors harness both clathrin - and caveolae - dependent pathways for internalization [ 5 - 8 ] . TGF - β and related growth factors regulate a variety of important cellular processes such as cell proliferation , differentiation , motility and apoptosis [ 9 , 10 ] . Disregula - tion of their signal transduction has been associated with several human diseases such as cancer and tissue fibrosis [ 11 , 12 ] . TGF - β signaling is initiated when TGF - β binds to the single transmembrane serine / threonine protein kinase known as TGF - β type II receptor ( TβRII ) . The TGF - β type I receptor ( TβRI ) is then recruited to and activated by TβRII , which in turn leads to the phosphor - ylation of Smad2 / 3 . The activated Smad2 / 3 - Smad4 com - plexes are translocated into the nucleus where they bind DNA and other transcriptional machineries to regulate the transcription of target genes [ 13 , 14 ] . Previous studies have shown that TGF - β receptors un - dergo a rapid yet constant internalization in a ligand - de - pendent or - independent way [ 5 - 8 , 15 - 17 ] . The two ma - jor endocytic pathways , clathrin - mediated endocytosis and caveolae - mediated endocytosis , have been reported to independently mediate the internalization of TGF - β receptors based on indirect evidence [ 5 - 8 ] . For instance , TGF - β receptors were found to associate with clath - rin - associated adaptor complex AP - 2 or their endocytosis was dampened by potassium depletion , cytosol acidi - fication or hypertonic buffer [ 6 - 8 , 15 , 18 ] , and TGF - β receptors were observed to colocalize with caveolae at the plasma membrane or caveosomes in the cytoplasm [ 8 , 19 , 20 ] . However , up to now , the direct real - time moni - toring of TGF - β receptor internalization via either caveo - lae or clathrin has not been achieved yet , which is vital to understand the role of clathrin and caveolae in TGF - β re - ceptor endocytosis . Especially , it has been proposed that the internalization of TGF - β receptors via the clathrin pathway facilitates the phosphorylation of downstream Smad2 / 3 in EEA1 - positive early endosomes , whereas that the one via caveolae promotes TGF - β receptor ubiq - uitination and degradation in caveosomes [ 8 ] . Early en - dosomes have been recognized as a vital signaling organ - elle for TGF - β signaling [ 6 , 16 , 21 ] . However , in several studies , inhibition of clathrin - mediated endocytosis only slightly affected TGF - β1 - stimulated TGF - β signaling [ 5 , 17 , 20 ] , and disruption of caveolae - mediated endocyto - sis downregulated TGF - β signaling [ 20 ] , indicating that these two endocytic pathways are not functionally sepa - rated . On the other hand , during the infection of certain viruses , it has been observed that the viruses could be ex - changed between early endosomes and caveosomes [ 22 - 25 ] . However , it is still unclear whether there is a direct interaction between these two endocytic pathways and how the interaction between these two pathways could regulate the endocytic trafficking and signal transduction of TGF - β receptors . In this study , by using an integrative approach of live - cell fluorescence microscopy , electron microscopy and biochemical tools , we monitored the internalization of TGF - β receptor and discovered the direct fusion of clath - rin - and caveolae - mediated endocytic pathways during TGF - β receptor endocytic trafficking . Results Real - time observation of caveolae - and clathrin - mediat - ed TGF - β receptor endocytosis We used dual - color total internal reflection fluores - cence microscopy ( TIRFM ) to image cell membrane for the real - time observation of TβRI internalization . HeLa cells expressing Myc - tagged TβRI ( Myc - TβRI ) were sequentially labeled with anti - Myc antibody and fluores - cent - conjugated antibodies as reported [ 6 - 8 ] . Myc - TβRI was expressed at a reasonable level and its overexpres - sion showed minor effect on receptor endocytosis and signal transduction as shown in this study ( Supplementary information , Figures S1 and S2 ) and previous reports [ 6 - 8 ] . To investigate the role of caveolae in TβRI inter - nalization , HeLa cells were co - transfected with Myc - TβRI and C - terminally EGFP - tagged caveolin - 1 ( cave - olin - 1 - EGFP ) [ 26 ] . Dual - color TIRFM imaging showed that caveolin - 1 - EGFP and Myc - TβRI signals appeared as well - dispersed fluorescent spots at the plasma membrane with partial colocalization ( ~ 13 . 6 % ; Figure 1A and Sup - plementary information , Figure S3A ) . With time - lapse imaging of Myc - TβRI and caveolin - 1 - EGFP , we noticed the simultaneous fluorescence loss of the colocalized caveolin - 1 - EGFP and Myc - TβRI spots from the plasma membrane in tens of seconds ( Figure 1B and Supplemen - tary information , Movie S1 ) , indicating their co - internal - ization [ 27 ] . Meanwhile , we found that TβRI could move toward and then colocalize with the pre - existing caveolae spots at the plasma membrane ( Figure 1C and Supple - mentary information , Movie S2 ) . These results indicate that the pre - existing caveolae at the plasma membrane can mediate TβRI endocytosis . To visualize clathrin - mediated endocytosis , cells were co - transfected with EGFP - clathrin and Myc - TβRI . Du - al - color TIRFM imaging showed that a few TβRI spots were colocalized with clathrin spots at the plasma mem - brane ( ~ 9 . 4 % ; Figure 1D and Supplementary informa - tion , Figure S3B ) . The clathrin spot was found to show up and grow bigger around the pre - existing TβRI spot at the plasma membrane . Then the fluorescence of clathrin and TβRI disappeared from the plasma membrane simul - taneously ( Figure 1E and Supplementary information , 740 Localization of TβRI in caveolin - 1 - positive early endosomes npg Cell Research | Vol 25 No 6 | June 2015 Figure 1 Real - time TIRFM imaging of caveolae - and clathrin - mediated T β RI endocytosis .

Kangmin He et al . 741 npg www . cell - research . com | Cell Research Movie S3 ) , indicating clathrin - mediated internalization of TβRI . Intracellular distribution of TGF - β receptors in caveo - lin - 1 - positive early endosomes To probe the intracellular distribution of TβRI , we immunolabeled caveolin - 1 - EGFP - expressing HeLa cells with anti - TβRI ( V - 22 ) and anti - EEA1 antibodies and carried out the imaging by confocal microscopy . Unex - pectedly , triple - color confocal imaging revealed that the endogenous TβRI colocalized with caveolin - 1 and EEA1 double - positive spots ( Figure 2A ) . To further charac - terize the subcellular distribution of the internalized TβRI , Myc - TβRI - expressing cells were immunolabeled with anti - EEA1 and anti - caveolin - 1 antibodies . Con - sistent with the distribution of endogenous TβRI , after TGF - β1 treatment for 30 min , Myc - TβRI signals was distributed in four different intracellular compartments : in addition to the well - known EEA1 - positive vesicles , caveolin - 1 - positive vesicles , EEA1 and caveolin - 1 dou - ble - negative vesicles , they were also found in EEA1 and caveolin - 1 double - positive vesicles ( termed the cave - olin - 1 - positive early endosome in this study ; ~ 29 . 9 % ; Figure 2B and 2C , and Supplementary information , Fig - ure S4 ) . In the absence of TGF - β1 , a similar percentage of TβRI signals were found in caveolin - 1 - positive early endosomes ( ~ 31 . 7 % ; Figure 2C and Supplementary information , Figure S4E ) . Upon TGF - β1 treatment , the distribution of TβRI was increased in EEA1 - positive vesicles , but decreased in caveolin - 1 - positive vesicles ( Supplementary information , Figure S4E ) . Moreover , the distribution of TβRI in caveolin - 1 - positive early en - dosomes was not cell specific as it was also observed in mink lung epithelial Mv1Lu cells ( Supplementary infor - mation , Figure S5 ) . Next , we used an integrative approach of three - dimen - sional confocal microscopy , triple - color live - cell con - focal microscopy , electron microscopy and biochemical tools to confirm the existence of the caveolin - 1 - positive early endosomes and to further characterize these novel structures : ( 1 ) In the x - z and y - z cross - sectional images of the three - dimensional z - stacks , the distribution of TRI in the caveolin - 1 - positive early endosomes could be readily observed ( Figure 2D ) . ( 2 ) As the average size of early endosomes is around the resolution of light micros - copy ( ~ 200 nm ) , we then resolved the ultrastructure of caveolin - 1 - positive early endosomes by immunoelectron microscopy . By labeling EEA1 and caveolin - 1 using different sizes of gold nanoparticles , we found the distri - bution of caveolin - 1 on the membrane of EEA1 - positive early endosomes ( Supplementary information , Figure S6 ) . ( 3 ) We immunoisolated the EEA1 - positive early endosomes using a subcellular fractionation protocol [ 28 , 29 ] . The immunoisolated early endosomes were then an - alyzed by western blotting with antibodies against EEA1 , caveolin - 1 , TGF - β receptor , Golgi protein p115 and mitochondrial protein Tim23 . Consistent with the above results , we further confirmed the specific distribution of caveolin - 1 and TGF - β receptor in EEA1 - positive early endosomes , and found that their colocalization was deter - gent sensitive ( Figure 2E ) . ( 4 ) To track caveolin - 1 - posi - tive early endosomes in live cells , the cells were incubat - ed with fluorescent - conjugated transferrin , a well - char - acterized marker for early endosomes ( Figure 2F ) . Live - cell imaging showed the coordinated movement of Myc - TβRI , caveolin - 1 and transferrin spots as triple - positive vesicles within cells ( Figure 2G and Supplementary information , Movie S4 ) . The fusion and separation of TβRI , caveolin - 1 and transferrin molecules were also ob - served ( Figure 2H and Supplementary information , Mov - ie S5 ) . We further examined the intracellular distribution of TβRI when the clathrin - or caveolae - mediated endocy - tosis was interfered ( Supplementary information , Figure S7A and S7B ) . Upon blocking of the clathrin - mediated endocytic pathway by K + depletion [ 8 ] , the distribution of TβRI in EEA1 - positive early endosomes was decreased , while its distribution in caveolin - 1 - positive compart - ments was increased ( Supplementary information , Figure S7C ) . Upon blocking the caveolae - mediated endocytosis by filipin [ 20 ] , more TRI molecules were found in the EEA1 - positive early endosomes , but less were found in caveolin - 1 - positive compartments ( Supplementary infor - mation , Figure S7D ) . Blocking either clathrin - or caveo - lae - dependent pathways reduced the distribution of TβRI in caveolin - 1 - positive early endosomes ( Supplementary information , Figure S7C and S7D ) , indicating that both clathrin - and caveolae - mediated endocytosis contribute to the fusion of these two endocytic pathways . Taken together , these results demonstrate that the internalized TGF - β receptor could be transported to the novel caveo - lin - 1 - positive early endosomes . Fusion of clathrin - coated vesicles and caveolar vesicles underneath the plasma membrane Next , we aimed to investigate where the fusion of the two endocytic pathways is initiated . By imaging the basal plasma membrane of cells co - expressing caveolin - 1 - EG - FP , clathrin - DsRed and Myc - TβRI , we found that these three molecules showed no obvious colocalization ( ~ 2 . 6 % of TβRI molecules were colocalized with both clathrin and caveolin - 1 ; Figure 3A and Supplementary informa - tion , Figure S3C ) . However , the clathrin and caveolin - 1 double - positive vesicles containing TβRI were readily observed in the cytoplasm of the same cell ( ~ 27 . 6 % of 742 Localization of TβRI in caveolin - 1 - positive early endosomes npg Cell Research | Vol 25 No 6 | June 2015 TβRI molecules were colocalized with both clathrin and caveolin - 1 ; Figure 3A ) . Consistent with this , by immu - nostaining the cells with antibodies against caveolin - 1 and clathrin , TβRI signals were also found in clathrin and caveolin - 1 double - positive vesicles within cells ( Figure 3B ) . We further characterized the clathrin and caveolin - 1 double - positive vesicles by immunofluorescence , elec - Kangmin He et al . 743 npg www . cell - research . com | Cell Research tron microscopy and triple - color live - cell imaging . ( 1 ) By immunostaining endogenous caveolin - 1 and clathrin in cells without Myc - TβRI expression , we found that clathrin - and caveolin - 1 - labeled vesicles were partially overlapped ( Figure 3C ) . Further analysis revealed that centers of clathrin - coated and caveolar vesicles were ~ 130 nm apart ( Figure 3C ) . ( 2 ) By using transmission electron microscopy , we observed morphologically char - acteristic clathrin - coated pits and caveolae ( the flask - shaped membrane invagination ) at the plasma membrane as previously described [ 30 , 31 ] . The partially fused caveolar and clathrin - coated vesicles were also observed ( Figure 3D ) . ( 3 ) By live - cell imaging , we revealed the coordinated movement of the fluorescent protein - labeled caveolin - 1 and clathrin from the lateral plasma mem - brane to the cytoplasm ( Figure 3E and Supplementary in - formation , Movie S6 ) . The caveolin - 1 , clathrin and TβRI triple - positive vesicles were also found to move from the lateral plasma membrane to the cytoplasm ( Figure 3F and Supplementary information , Movie S7 ) . Thus , the above results revealed that the internalized clathrin - coat - ed vesicles and caveolar vesicles could be fused to form caveolin - 1 and clathrin double - positive organelle under - neath the plasma membrane . We also examined this fused pathway with another growth factor receptor , the receptor tyrosine kinase epi - dermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . EGFR has been shown to utilize clathrin - but not caveolae - mediated pathway to enter cells after activation [ 32 ] . Consistent with previous studies [ 32 ] , we found that the activated EGFR was colocalized extensively with clathrin but not caveolin - 1 at the plasma membrane by dual - color TIR - FM ( Supplementary information , Figure S8A and S8B ) . However , the internalized EGFR molecules were distrib - uted in clathrin and caveolin - 1 double - positive vesicles , and then were transported to caveolin - 1 - positive early endosomes as well ( Supplementary information , Figure S8C - S8E ) . These results suggest that not only the serine / threonine kinase TGF - β receptor but also the receptor tyrosine kinase EGFR can utilize the fusion pathway for endocytic trafficking . Rab5 regulates the formation of caveolin - 1 - positive early endosomes from caveolin - 1 and clathrin double - positive vesicles The small GTPase Rab5 is a crucial regulator in the early stages of endocytic trafficking by modulating the fusion of clathrin - coated vesicles with early endosomes [ 33 , 34 ] . Studies also found that Rab5 could directly bind to the transmembrane scaffold and C - terminal do - mains of caveolin - 1 [ 35 ] . We aimed to study whether Rab5 regulates the fusion of the clathrin - coated vesi - cles with caveolar vesicles , or the fused vesicles with early endosomes . In cells co - expressing ECFP - Rab5 , caveolin - 1 - EGFP , clathrin - DsRed and Myc - TβRI , in - tracellular colocalization of these four molecules was readily observed by multi - color imaging ( Figure 4A ) . We also observed the constant movement of caveo - lin - 1 - EGFP , mRFP - Rab5 and Myc - TβRI triple - positive vesicles within cells by live - cell imaging ( Figure 4B and Supplementary information , Movie S8 ) , indicating the spatial association among caveolin - 1 , Rab5 and TβRI . In cell expressing the dominant - negative Rab5 mutant ( Rab5S34N ) , the number of EEA1 - positive early endo - somes was significantly reduced . However , the caveo - lin - 1 and clathrin double - positive vesicles were unaffect - ed ( Figure 4C ) . In addition , we found that the caveolin - 1 and clathrin double - positive vesicles were negatively stained with the endosomal SNARE ( Soluble N - ethylma - leimidesensitive factor attachment protein receptors ) pro - teins Vti1a and syntaxin 6 ( Supplementary information , Figure S9 ) . Thus , these results suggest that the fusion of clathrin - coated and caveolar vesicles occurs ahead of their fusion with early endosomes . To further determine the role of Rab5 in the formation of caveolin - 1 - positive early endosomes and the intracel - Figure 2 Distribution of T β RI in caveolin - 1 - positive early endosomes .

Remarkably , Rab5Q79L expression ( with a similar expression level to wild - type Rab5 and Rab5S34N ) resulted in enlarged caveolin - 1 - positive ear - ly endosomes where 81 . 2 % of TβRI signals were trapped ( Figure 4F and 4G ) . These results suggest that Rab5 regulates the formation of caveolin - 1 - positive early en - dosomes and the intracellular distribution of TβRI . Detection of SARA , Rab11 and Smad7 / Smurf2 in caveo - lin - 1 - positive early endosomes The distribution of TβRI in caveolin - 1 - positive early endosomes raises the question about the role of cave - olin - 1 - positive early endosomes in TGF - β signaling . Early endosomes have been recognized as an important signaling center for TGF - β / Smad signaling [ 6 , 8 , 36 ] . In cells co - expressing EGFP - Smad3 , caveolin - 1 - mRFP and Rab5Q79L , and immunostained for EEA1 , we observed the accumulation of EGFP - Smad3 in the enlarged caveo - lin - 1 - positive early endosomes ( Figure 5A ) . SARA ( Smad anchor for receptor activation ) , a FYVE domain - contain - ing protein , has been reported to facilitate Smad2 / 3 phos - phorylation by TGF - β receptor in early endosomes [ 6 , 37 ] . By immunostaining for SARA , we found that SARA was also located in caveolin - 1 - positive early endosomes ( Figure 5B ) , indicating that caveolin - 1 - positive early en - dosomes may be involved in TGF - β signaling . We also observed a sudden appearance of overlapped caveolin - 1 - EGFP and Myc - TβRI spots at the plasma membrane by TIRFM imaging several minutes after the initiation of TβRI internalization ( Supplementary infor - mation , Figure S10A ) . In addition , the caveolin - 1 - EGFP and Myc - TβRI double - positive vesicles were observed to move actively toward the plasma membrane from the cell interior ( Supplementary information , Figure S10B ) . These results suggest that the caveolin - 1 - containing vesicles are involved in TβRI recycling . To confirm this , we examined whether Rab11 , a small GTPase regulat - ing TβRI recycling [ 7 ] , is associated with the caveo - lin - 1 - containing vesicles . In cells co - expressing ECFP - Rab11 , caveolin - 1 - EGFP and Myc - TβRI and labeled for transferrin , the vesicles positive for these four molecules were observed ( Figure 5C ) . The association of Rab11 , caveolin - 1 and TβRI was further confirmed by their co - ordinated movement in a live cell ( Figure 5D and Sup - plementary information , Movie S9 ) . As the caveolae / raft components have been reported to be enriched in recycling endosomes to regulate protein / lipid sorting and trafficking [ 38 ] , these results suggest that caveolin - 1 - pos - itive early endosomes may be involved in Rab11 - regulat - ed TβRI recycling . Caveolae - mediated endocytosis has been shown to negatively regulate TGF - β signaling by promoting TGF - β receptor turnover , probably via Smad7 / Smurf - cat - alyzed ubiquitination [ 8 , 39 ] . The existence of caveolin - 1 in early endosomes led us to ask whether caveolin - 1 - pos - itive early endosomes participate in TβRI degradation . In cells co - expressing caveolin - 1 - ECFP , Myc - TβRI and Smad7 - HA and immunostained for EEA1 , the colocal - ization of these four molecules was observed in the cyto - plasm ( Figure 5E ) . Similarly , Smurf2 was also found to associate with the caveolin - 1 - positive early endosomes ( Figure 5F ) . These results suggest that by recruiting Smad7 / Smurf2 , the caveolin - 1 - positive early endosomes may be involved in TβRI degradation .

Scale bar = 10 µ m . 40 , bovine papillomavirus type 1 and John Cunningham virus , they were found to locate in the caveolin - 1 and EEA1 double - positive vesicles within cells [ 22 - 25 ] . As these viruses are internalized via either caveolae - or clathrin - mediated endocytosis , it has been proposed that caveolin - 1 and EEA1 double - positive vesicles are originated from either the direct transport of the initially internalized caveosomes to early endosomes [ 23 , 40 ] or the sorting of clathrin / early endosomal vesicles to the ca - veolin - 1 - positive compartments [ 24 ] . However , there is no direct evidence on whether and how the convergence of these two pathways occurs . By tracking the intracellu - lar dynamic trafficking of TβRI , we observed the direct fusion of clathrin - coated vesicles and caveolar vesicles upon their internalization , which occurs before they reach the early endosome and contribute to the formation of the multifunctional sorting device , caveolin - 1 - positive early endosomes , for TGF - β receptors ( Figure 6 ) . When clathrin - coated pits are pinched off from the plasma membrane , the free clathrin - coated vesicles rap - Kangmin He et al . 747 npg www . cell - research . com | Cell Research Figure 5 Detection of Smad3 / SARA , Rab11 and Smad7 / Smurf2 in caveolin - 1 - positive early endosomes .

Still , clathrin - coated ves - icles can be frequently observed underneath the plasma membrane as shown in this study and previous reports [ 44 , 45 ] . Although it is well recognized that caveolae and clathrin - coated pits are separately located invaginations at the plasma membrane [ 2 , 30 ] , the distribution of clath - rin - coated vesicles and caveolar vesicles within the cell is less understood . By electron microscopy , we revealed that certain clathrin - coated vesicles and caveolar vesicles were partially fused . When the partially coated clathrin structures ( e . g . , clathrin plaques and the clathrin - coated vesicles undergoing coat disassembly ) expose the uncov - ered lipid membranes to the adjacent caveolar vesicles [ 46 ] , the two vesicles could undergo partial fusion . Mem - brane fusion is usually mediated by Rab and SNARE proteins [ 47 ] . Our results revealed that the SNARE pro - teins ( Vti1a and syntaxin 6 ) were not associated with the fused clathrin and caveolin - 1 double - positive vesicles . Moreover , although Rab5 was located in the fused cave - olar and clathrin - coated vesicles , the dominant - negative mutant of Rab5 did not impair the fusion of caveolar vesicles with clathrin - coated vesicles , but reduced the formation of caveolin - 1 and EEA1 double - positive vesicles . Therefore , by targeting the caveolar and clath - rin - coated vesicles , Rab5 could guide the caveolar and clathrin - coated vesicles to early endosomes , which leads to the formation of the multifunctional cavelin - 1 - positive early endosomes . It is known that the distinct endosomal membrane domains contain different compositions , such as Rab4 , Rab5 , Rab7 , Rab11 , Arf1 , COPI , caveolin - 1 , clathrin and SARA , either by transient interaction or stable associa - tion [ 8 , 23 , 48 ] . These sub - domains endow early endo - somes with variable functions , such as sorting cargoes to recycling or degradation compartments , accelerating virus infection and enhancing signaling transduction [ 8 , 23 - 25 , 48 ] . In this study , we demonstrate the existence of the multi - component early endosomes containing EEA1 , caveolin - 1 , Rab5 , TβRI , Smad3 / SARA , Smad7 / Smurf2 and Rab11 . The multi - component and multi - functional organelle provides a favorable place for TGF - β receptors to access these different molecules easily , thus efficient - ly promoting TGF - β signaling and TβRI recycling and degradation . However , the exact location and dynamics of each protein in the membrane of early endosomes is still unknown , and the nano - scale live - cell imaging by multi - color super - resolution microscopy may help solve these issues . Meanwhile , whether the caveolin - 1 - positive early endosome is a multifunctional organelle for the other internalized receptors needs further investigation . Therefore , although extracellular cargoes such as TGF - β receptors can choose either clathrin - or cave - lae - mediated endocytic pathways for internalization at the plasma membrane , it is possible that they are also delivered to a fusion pathway in the cytoplasm to receive a second run of sorting . Materials and Methods Cell culture HeLa and TβRI - deficient mink lung epithelial L17 cells [ 5 , 49 ] were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM , Gibco ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Hyclone ) and antibiotics ( 50 mg / ml streptomycin , 50 U / ml penicillin ) at 37 ° C in a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . Plasmids and transfection Plasmids of Myc - TβRI and Smad7 - HA were constructed as previously described [ 50 , 51 ] . Full - length human Smad3 cDNA Figure 6 Schematic representation of the convergence of clath - rin - and caveolae - mediated endocytic pathways during T β RI endocytic trafficking . Although clathrin - coated pits and caveolae can mediate the internalization of T β RI at the plasma membrane independently , a portion of clathrin - coated vesicles and caveo - lar vesicles are fused after their internalization into cells . Under the regulation of Rab5 , the fused vesicles are further targeted to early endosomes to deliver the internalized T β RI ( ~ 30 % ) to the caveolin - 1 - positive early endosomes . As a multi - component organelle , the caveolin - 1 - positive early endosome could act as a multifunctional sorting center for T β RI .

The K + - depletion media ( 140 mM NaCl , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgSO 4 , 5 . 5 mM glu - cose , 0 . 5 % BSA , and 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 ) and control media ( the K + - depletion media supplemented with 10 mM KCl ) were prepared as previously described [ 8 ] . Immunofluorescence microscopy Cells were permeabilized in PBS containing 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 for 10 min , and fixed with 4 % formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature . Then the cells were washed with PBS for three times and incubated in the blocking buffer ( PBS , 0 . 5 % bovine serum albumin ) for 30 min . After that , the cells were incubated with the diluted primary antibodies in the blocking buffer at 4 ° C overnight , washed with PBS for three times , and then incubated with the diluted fluorescent - conjugated secondary antibodies in blocking buffer at 4 °C for 1 h . For labeling with two or more anti - bodies , the procedures were repeated . The prepared cell samples were imaged with a confocal micro - scope ( FluoView FV1000 - IX81 , Olympus , Japan ) equipped with a 100× / 1 . 40NA objective . For multi - color imaging , ECFP was excit - ed by a 405 nm laser ( FV5 - LD405 - 2 , Olympus ) and the emission was collected using a 425 - 475 nm bandpass filter . EGFP and Alexa Fluor 488 were excited by a 488 nm laser ( FV5 - LAMAR , Olym - pus ) and the emission was collected using a 500 - 545 nm bandpass filter . DsRed , mRFP , Alexa Fluor 555 and Rhodamine were excit - ed by a 559 nm laser ( FV10 - LD559 , Olympus ) and the emission was collected using a 570 - 625 nm bandpass filter . Alexa Fluor 633 was excited by a 635 nm laser ( FV10 - LD635 , Olympus ) and the emission was collected using a 655 - 755 nm bandpass filter . For multi - color imaging , the fluorophores were excited by the corre - sponding lasers and the fluorescence signals were collected by the corresponding emission filters sequentially . In this setup and under our experiment condition , the color bleed - through between dif - ferent channels is negligible ( Supplementary information , Figure S11 ) . To image the subcellular distribution of Myc - TβRI at the basal plasma membrane plane and underneath the basal plasma mem - brane of the same cell , the objective was firstly focused on the basal plasma membrane and one image was collected . Then the objective was moved up for ~ 1 µm driven by the Z - piezo to focus on a new plane within the cell but still near the basal plasma mem - brane ( underneath the basal plasma membrane ) and another image was collected . Live - cell fluorescence imaging Live - cell receptor labeling was carried out as previously de - scribed [ 8 ] . Briefly , cells expressing Myc - TβRI were sequentially incubated with anti - Myc antibody and the fluorescent - conjugated secondary antibody at 4 ° C for 1 h . Then the cells were transferred to 37 ° C to initiate receptor internalization . Dual - color TIRFM was performed using a highly sensitive TIRFM with 100× / 1 . 45NA Plan Apochromat objective ( Olym - pus , Japan ) and a 14 - bit back - illuminated electron - multiplying charge - coupled device camera ( EMCCD ; Andor iXon DU - 897 BV ) . EGFP was excited at 488 nm by an argon laser ( Melles Griot , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . DsRed and Alexa Fluor 555 were exited with the 561 nm line of laser ( Melles Griot ) . Green and red emissions were collected simultaneously using a dual - view splitter ( Optical Insights , Santa Fe , NM , USA ) equipped with a 515 / 30 nm band - pass filter to collect green emission , a 550 nm dichroic mirror to split the emission , and a 580 nm long - pass filter to collect the red emission . Videos were acquired using MetaMorph software ( Mo - lecular Device ) . Live - cell dual - color intracellular tracking was performed with an inverted fluorescence microscope ( Olympus IX71 , Japan ) equipped with a CSU10 spinning - disk confocal laser - scanner unit ( Yokogawa Electronic , Tokyo , Japan ) and a 100× / 1 . 45NA objective ( Olympus ) . The cells were excited with an argon ion laser ( Melles Griot ) . The fluorescence signals were directed to an EMCCD camera ( Andor iXon DU - 897 BV ) . Live - cell triple - col - or intracellular tracking was performed with the same confocal microscope ( Olympus FluoView FV1000 , Japan ) as described for immunofluorescence . Image analysis Single - particle tracking was performed with Image J ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ) . Kymographs of moving objects were generated using ImageJ plugin Multiple Kymograph . Triple colocalization of Myc - TβRI , caveolin - 1 and EEA1 was determined by using the Blobprob ImageJ plugin as previously reported [ 58 ] . Cells with a medium expression and labeling lev - el of Myc - TβRI were selected for each experiment groups . The Mander’s overlay coefficients were calculated based on the triple colocalization identified ( Supplementary information , Figure S4C ) . The triple colocalization was also determined by visual inspection . Briefly , for evaluating the colocalizaiton of Myc - TβRI with cave - olin - 1 and EEA1 , a low threshold in each channel was used to en - sure only the clearly observed monodispersed Myc - TβRI , caveo - lin - 1 and EEA1 spots were included in the analysis . After merging the Myc - TβRI channel with either caveolin - 1 or EEA1 channel by Image J , the colocalization of Myc - TβRI with caveolin - 1 or EEA1 was manually counted . Then for each Myc - TβRI spot , if it was found to colocalize with both caveolin - 1 and EEA1 in the merged channels , it was assigned as the triple - positive vesicle ( caveo - lin - 1 + EEA1 ) . We found that the Mander’s coefficients determined 750 Localization of TβRI in caveolin - 1 - positive early endosomes npg Cell Research | Vol 25 No 6 | June 2015 by Blobprob ImageJ plugin matched well with the colocalization level determined by visual inspection ( Supplementary information , Figure S4 ) . Electron and immunoelectron microscopy Electron microscopy of clathrin - coated pits / vesicles and cav - eolae in HeLa cells was performed as follows : HeLa cells were fixed with 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in PBS for 24 h . The cells were then post - fixed in 1 % osmium tetroxide for 1 h , embedded in Spurr’s resin , sectioned , doubly stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate , and then examined using a Zeiss EM 10 transmission electron microscope . Double immunogold microscopy was performed as previously described [ 59 , 60 ] . HeLa cells were fixed with 4 % formaldehyde in PBS for 24 h . The cells were then post - fixed in 1 % osmium tetroxide for 1 h , embedded in Spurr’s resin and sectioned . The sections were blocked by incubating in PBS containing 5 % BSA , 10 % normal goat serum and 0 . 1 % cold water fish skin gelatin for 1 h . Then the sections were immunostained with rabbit polyclonal anti - caveolin - 1 ( 610059 , BD biosciences , 1 : 100 ) in the blocking solution at 4 ° C overnight . The sections were then washed several times with PBS and incubated with 10 - nm protein A - gold ( provid - ed by Dr Posthuma G , University of Utrecht , The Netherlands ) at room temperature for 1 h . The sections were then washed several times with PBS and incubated in the blocking solution at room temperature for 3 h . Then the sections were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti - EEA1 ( sc - 33585 , Santa Cruz , 1 : 100 ) followed by the 15 - nm protein A - gold ( provided by Dr Posthuma G ) as de - scribed above . In the control sections , low levels of gold nanopar - ticle - labeling were detected . The sections were then washed sev - eral times with PBS and were doubly stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate , and examined using a Zeiss EM 10 transmission electron microscope . Immunoisolation of early endosomes The EEA1 - positive early endosomes were isolated as previ - ously described [ 28 , 29 ] . In brief , the cells were washed with ice - cold PBS twice , rinsed with osmotic buffer ( 10 mM Tris / HCl , pH 7 . 4 ) for 1 min , and treated with homogenization buffer ( 10 mM Tris / HCl , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , 3 mM Imidazole , 250 mM sucrose , Complete protease inhibitors , pH 7 . 4 ) . Then the cells were scraped and collected . The cells were homogenized by 10 passes through a needle . The cell homogenates were centrifuged at 1 000× g at 4 ° C for 10 min and the postnuclear supernatant was collected . The early endosomes were immunoprecipitated by an - ti - EEA1 antibodies and protein - A beads or magnetic beads . After the beads were washed with 0 . 1 % BSA - containing PBS , they were loaded with the loading buffer and boiled . The immunoprecipitat - ed early endosomes were then analyzed by western blotting using specific antibodies . Statistical analysis The Student’s two - tailed t - test or One - way ANOVA test used in statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism ( GraphPad Software ) . P < 0 . 05 was regarded as statistically significant .
