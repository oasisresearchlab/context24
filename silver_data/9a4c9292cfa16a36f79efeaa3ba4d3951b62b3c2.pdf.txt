Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 289 : L834 – L841 , 2005 . First published June 17 , 2005 ; doi : 10 . 1152 / ajplung . 00069 . 2005 . —Overdistention of lung tissue dur - ing mechanical ventilation may be one of the factors that initiates ventilator - induced lung injury ( VILI ) . We hypothesized that cyclic mechanical stretch ( CMS ) of the lung epithelium is involved in the early events of VILI through the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . Cultures of an immortalized human airway epithelial cell line ( 16HBE ) , a human alveolar type II cell line ( A549 ) , and primary cultures of rat alveolar type II cells were cyclically stretched , and the production of superoxide ( O 2 (cid:1) ) was measured by dihydro - ethidium ﬂuorescence . CMS stimulated increased production of O 2 (cid:1) afte r 2 h ineach type of cell . 16HBE cells exhibited no signiﬁcant stimulation of ROS befor e 2 h of CMS ( 20 % strain , 30 cycles / min ) , and ROS production returned to control levels after 24 h . Oxida - tion of glutathione ( GSH ) , a cellular antioxidant , increased with CMS as measured by a decrease in the ratio of the reduced GSH level to the oxidized GSH level . Strain levels of 10 % did not increase O 2 (cid:1) production in 16HBE cells , whereas 15 , 20 , and 30 % signiﬁcantly increased generation of O 2 (cid:1) . Rotenone , a mitochon - drial complex I inhibitor , partially abrogated the stretch - induced generation of O 2 (cid:1) afte r 2 h CMS in16HBE cells . NADPH oxidase activity was increased after 2 h of CMS , contributing to the production of O 2 (cid:1) . Increased ROS production in lung epithelial cells in response to elevated stretch may contribute to the onset of VILI . mechanotransduction ; ventilator - induced lung injury IN PATIENTS WITH ACUTE HYPOXEMIC respiratory failure , mechan - ical ventilation strategies employed to improve arterial oxy - genation can initiate or exacerbate lung injury . Mechanisms implicated in ventilator - induced lung injury ( VILI ) include high inspiratory volumes or “volutrauma , ” mechanical stress - induced inﬂammation or “biotrauma , ” and cyclical airway collapse and reopening . Low tidal volume ventilation strategies that minimize overdistention of the lung tissue decrease mor - tality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , presumably by limiting or preventing additional VILI ( 40 ) . Recent animal studies in a mouse model of VILI dem - onstrated that high tidal volume ventilation without underlying lung injury led to increased neutrophil inﬁltration ( 5 ) and proinﬂammatory cytokines in the lungs ( 46 ) , indicating a link between volutrauma and biotrauma . However , the factors lead - ing from mechanical stress to the initiation and propagation of VILI remain uncertain . One potential initiating signal may be increased production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in the lung epithelium in response to increased stretch . Increased ROS production in response to mechanical stress has been described in a variety of cell types . Endo - thelial cell production of ROS has been shown to increase in response to shear stress ( 4 , 6 , 7 , 10 , 19 , 30 , 45 , 50 ) and to cyclic mechanical stretch ( CMS ; see Refs . 2 , 29 , 47 , 48 ) . CMS also stimulates ROS production in vascular smooth muscle cells ( 13 , 22 , 31 ) and cardiac myocytes ( 1 ) . Al - though superoxide ( O 2 (cid:1) ) appears to be the initial species generated in these cell types , there is disagreement as to the source of ROS production . The NADPH oxidase system ( 7 , 13 , 29 , 30 ) , mitochondrial production ( 2 , 21 ) , and the xanthine oxidase system ( 30 ) have all been implicated as potential sources for increased O 2 (cid:1) production in response to mechanical stress . However , whether these potential sources are activated directly or indirectly by mechanical stress is unclear . Little data are available demonstrating increased ROS production by stretched alveolar or airway epithelial cells . A 25 % increase in ROS production , as measured by 2 , 7 - dichlorodihydroﬂuorescein ( DCFH ) ﬂuorescence caused by interaction with H 2 O 2 , was measured in response to 30 % biaxial stretch of A549 cells , a human alveolar type II - like cell line ( 42 ) . In another study , A549 cells subjected to cyclic stretch produced signiﬁcantly increased levels of isoprostane ( a marker of oxidant injury ) after 0 . 5 h , and levels of reduced glutathione ( GSH , an endogenous antioxidant ) were signiﬁ - cantly decreased afte r 1 h of CMS ( 23 ) . Pretreatment with antioxidants prevented the change in isoprostane levels in this study . However , the source ( s ) of increased ROS production and species generated in pulmonary epithelial cells exposed to mechanical stretch have not been determined . In the current study , we examined whether cyclic mechan - ical strain induced production of O 2 (cid:1) in the main epithelial constituents of the lungs , airway and alveolar epithelial cells . O 2 (cid:1) production was signiﬁcantly enhanced in an SV40 - trans - formed human airway epithelial cell line ( 16HBE ) , A549 cells , and isolated primary rat alveolar type II ( rat AT II ) epithelial cells undergoing CMS . Increased ROS production was depen - dent on the time and magnitude of stretch . The source of the O 2 (cid:1) was a combination of the NADPH oxidase system and the mitochondria ( complex I ) . Mitochondrial involvement may be initiated by a direct distention of the mitochondria resulting from mechanical stretch . Address for reprint requests and other correspondence : C . M .

Unless otherwise noted , all chemicals were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich Chemical ( St . Louis , MO ) . Cell culture . 16HBE cells were generously provided by Dr . Deiter Gruenert and were cultured in DMEM ( GIBCO , Carlsbad , CA ) with 4 mM glutamine supplemented with 10 % FBS ( Cellgro , Herndon , VA or GIBCO ) , 20 mM HEPES ( Sigma ) , and 2 . 5 (cid:2) M Plasmocin ( Invi - vogen , San Diego , CA ) . These cells were ﬁrst treated for 2 wk with 25 (cid:2) M Plasmocin . A549 cells were cultured in DMEM with 4 mM glutamine supplemented with 10 % FBS ( Cellgro ) and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin solution ( GIBCO ) . Both cell types were cultured until 85 – 100 % conﬂuence before being seeded on the BioFlex plates coated with collagen type I ( Flexcell International , Hillsborough , NC ) for studies on conﬂuent monolayers . The medium was changed every other day for all cultures . Isolation and culture of rat AT II cells . Primary rat AT II cells were isolated according to established procedures ( 8 , 26 , 32 ) . Brieﬂy , male Sprague - Dawley rats were anesthetized with phenobarbital , killed by exsanguination , and their lungs were excised . The trachea was cath - eterized , and the pulmonary vasculature was perfused via the pulmo - nary artery with solution II ( in mM : 140 NaCl , 5 KCl , 2 . 5 Na 2 HPO 4 , 10 HEPES , 1 . 3 MgSO 4 , and 2 . 0 CaCl 2 ; pH 7 . 4 ) to remove the blood . The air spaces were then lavaged with solution I ( in mM : 140 NaCl , 5 KCl , 2 . 5 Na 2 HPO 4 , 6 glucose , 0 . 2 EGTA , and 10 HEPES ; pH 7 . 4 ) to remove free , nonepithelial cells . Elastase ( 4 . 3 U / ml in solution II ; Worthington Biochemical , Lakewood , NJ ) was instilled in the air space and incubated at 37°C for 10 min . This was repeated , and the large airways and heart were removed . The remaining lung tissue was then minced in 5 ml FBS and 250 (cid:2) l of 250 (cid:2) g / ml DNase ( Sigma ) per 4 lungs . The minced lungs were ﬁltered through gauze followed by a nitrocellulose membrane , and the cell suspension was collected . The suspension was centrifuged and resuspended in AT II culture medium [ DMEM with 10 % heat - inactivated FBS ( HyClone , Logan , UT ) , 4 mM glutamine , 1 % penicillin / streptomycin , and 0 . 25 (cid:2) M amphoter - icin B ( Sigma ) ] and plated on untreated petri dishes coated with IgG . The plates were incubated fo r 1 h toallow nonepithelial cells such as macrophages to bind to the IgG . The plates were “panned” to loosen nonspeciﬁcally bound cells , pooled , and counted . BioFlex plates coated with collagen type I by the manufacturer were then coated with 32 . 3 (cid:2) g / ml human ﬁbronectin ( Roche Life Sciences , Indianapolis , IN ) , and cells were seeded to conﬂuence at 3 . 0 (cid:3) 10 6 / well in AT II culture medium . Experiments were performed on day 2 after isolation . AT II cells were identiﬁed using Nile Red ( Sigma ) staining of lamellar bodies , and (cid:4) 90 % of the cells were Nile Red positive on day 2 . Application of mechanical strain . Strain was applied using a Flexercell strain unit 4000 ( Flexcell International ) , a vacuum - driven device that applies biaxial strain to cells cultured on Silastic - bottomed well plates . The device allows control of the frequency of strain and magnitude up to 30 % linear strain . 16HBE and A549 cells were strained at 20 % elongation and 30 cycles / min ( cpm ) for the initial studies . This strain proﬁle was previously found to maximally inhibit wound closure in airway epithelial cells ( 38 ) . Rat AT II cells were strained at 15 % elongation and 15 cpm because higher levels of strain and frequency resulted in increased cell detachment from the culture plate . Measurement of O 2 (cid:1) production . Intracellular O 2 (cid:1) production was measured by the ﬂuorescent intensity of oxoethidium after dihydro - ethidium ( DHE ; Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) was oxidized by O 2 (cid:1) . Oxoethidium binds to DNA , becoming highly ﬂuorescent . After treatment , cells were rinsed two times with warm serum - and phenol red - free ( PR - Free ) DMEM and loaded with 5 (cid:2) M DHE in PR - Free DMEM at 37°C in the incubator for 30 min . The cells were then rinsed one time with room temperature PR - Free DMEM , fresh PR - Free DMEM at room temperature was added , and the cells were imaged immediately . Images were taken on an inverted ﬂuorescent micro - scope ( TE300 ; Nikon Instruments , Lewisville , TX ) outﬁtted with a (cid:3) 20 PlanFluor objective ( Nikon Instruments ) , rhodamine ﬁlter set for excitation and emission ( Chrorma Technology , Rockingham , VT ) , and digital CCD camera ( Roper Scientiﬁc , Tucson , AZ ) . Images were acquired using MetaMorph software ( Universal Imaging , Downing - town , PA ) for 10 s with a (cid:3) 4 neutral density ﬁlter engaged . Four separate images were taken per well , avoiding areas of low conﬂuence and areas near the edge of the well . The average pixel intensity per image was calculated , and an average intensity per well was deter - mined . To assess the involvement of the mitochondria , treatment with the pharmacological inhibitor of the mitochondrial complex I , rote - none ( 25 nM ) , was initiated at the beginning of the stretch protocol . Measurement of reduced and oxidized glutathione levels . A proto - col from Kamencic et al . ( 25 ) adapted for a ﬂuorescence plate reader was used to determine levels of reduced and oxidized GSH ( GSSG ) . 16HBE cells were stretched or held static for various periods of time and then placed on ice . The cells were rinsed two times with ice - cold Ca 2 (cid:5) / Mg 2 (cid:5) - free Dulbecco’s phosphate - buffered saline ( DPBS ) . Ice - cold cell lysate buffer ( 0 . 5 ml , 0 . 2 mM EDTA in Ca 2 (cid:5) / Mg 2 (cid:5) - free DPBS ) was added to each well . The cells were scraped and transferred to centrifuge tubes at 4°C . Samples were sonicated on ice for 20 s . The samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 10 , 000 g and 4°C . Two 100 - (cid:2) l aliquots of each sample were diluted with 200 (cid:2) l deionized H 2 O / aliquot . One diluted aliquot from each sample was completely reduced by the addition of 15 (cid:2) l of 4 M triethanolamine ( TEA ) to determine the total amount of GSH . A standard curve of GSH with and without TEA was created . Wells of a black 96 - well plate were loaded with 50 (cid:2) l of diluted sample and 150 (cid:2) l assay solution ( 100 (cid:2) M mono - chlorobimane , 1 U / ml glutathione - S - transferase , and 0 . 2 mM EDTA in Ca 2 (cid:5) / Mg 2 (cid:5) - free DPBS ) , and the plate was incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature . The plate was then read in a ﬂuorescence plate reader ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 470 nm . To calculate GSSG , the amount of reduced GSH was subtracted from the TEA - treated sample and divided by two to account for the dimerization . The ratio of reduced GSH to GSSG was then calculated to monitor the redox state of the cells . NADPH oxidase assay . The assay used to determine NADPH oxidase activity was adapted from previous studies ( 7 , 51 ) . Cells were stretched or held static , placed on ice , and rinsed three times in ice - cold DPBS . Cells were placed in 0 . 5 ml homogenization buffer ( 1 mM EGTA , 10 (cid:2) g / ml aprotinin , 0 . 5 (cid:2) g / ml leupeptin , and 0 . 5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl ﬂuoride in Ca 2 (cid:5) / Mg 2 (cid:5) - free DPBS ) , scraped , homogenized manually , and placed in tubes . Cell homogenate ( 50 (cid:2) l ) was added to 3 ml warm chemiluminescence buffer ( 10 (cid:2) M Lucige - nin , 1 mM EGTA , and 150 mM sucrose in Ca 2 (cid:5) / Mg 2 (cid:5) - free DPBS ) containing NADPH ( 50 (cid:2) M ) in a scintillation vial . Chemilumines - cence was measured ( in duplicate ) for 3 min in a Packard scintillation counter . Diphenylene iodonium ( DPI , 10 (cid:2) M ) was included in the chemiluminescence buffer for selected static and stretched samples . Staining and imaging of mitochondria of stretched cells . 16HBE cells were cultured on collagen I - coated Silastic membranes for the StageFlexer ( Flexcell International ) , which is a single membrane stretching device adapted for use on a microscope stage . Live 16HBE cells were stained with 500 nM MitoTracker Orange ( Molecular Probes ) for 30 min and rinsed two times with warm DPBS . Mem - branes were placed in the StageFlexer , and images were acquired with a (cid:3) 60 objective ( Nikon ) before and after the application of (cid:6) 17 % biaxial strain . Because images included contributions of structures from multiple planes , we selected structures that were likely to be in thin or conﬁned regions of the cells such as beneath the nucleus and near the edges of the cells . The total length of each mitochondrion was measured by tracing a line down the center line of each structure to determine the overall length before and during strain . Statistical analysis . All values are presented as means (cid:7) SE . All statistical analyses were performed with the SigmaStat statistical package ( version 2 . 03 ; Jandel Scientiﬁc , San Rafael , CA ) . One - way ANOVA was performed for comparisons of multiple treatments .

All of the ANOVA tests were run with multiple comparisons against the static control except for the data collected using the mitochondrial inhibitor rotenone . These experiments employed multiple comparisons between all of the different treatments . Signiﬁcant differences are based on a threshold of P (cid:1) 0 . 05 . RESULTS CMS induces O 2 (cid:1) production in pulmonary epithelial cells . To determine if CMS increased O 2 (cid:1) production in airway and alveolar epithelial cells , we subjected 16HBE cells , A549 cells , and primary rat AT II cells t o 2 h of CMS andmeasured the O 2 (cid:1) production via DHE ﬂuorescence . Figure 1 A shows a region of representative images of 16HBE cells showing the changes in DHE ﬂuorescence intensity after 2 h of CMS . O 2 (cid:1) production was signiﬁcantly increased in each of the cell types that we tested compared with static controls ( see Fig . 1 B ) . The A549 cells exhibited the strongest response to CMS ( 142 . 5 (cid:7) 0 . 5 % ; P (cid:8) 0 . 05 , n (cid:9) 3 ) afte r 2 h ofstretch , but 16HBE and rat AT II cells displayed the same order of magnitude increase in O 2 (cid:1) production ( 126 . 7 (cid:7) 1 . 9 and 114 . 9 (cid:7) 2 . 8 % ; P (cid:8) 0 . 05 , n (cid:9) 9 and 6 , respectively ) . However , rat AT II cells were stretched at a lower frequency and magnitude because of cell detachment at the higher levels . Time course of O 2 (cid:1) production in response to stretch . We further investigated the time course of O 2 (cid:1) production in 16HBE cells in response to CMS . Figure 2 shows that there was no signiﬁcant change after 0 . 5 h of stretch , but the O 2 (cid:1) Fig . 1 .

These results suggest an initial increase in O 2 (cid:1) production in response to the initiation of stretch followed by a later adaptation to increased O 2 (cid:1) production . Oxidation of GSH increased in 16HBE cells exposed to CMS . To determine whether the measured O 2 (cid:1) production was increased because of a change in the redox state of the cells , we measured the relative levels of oxidized ( GSSG ) and reduced ( GSH ) glutathione . Reduced glutathione is an important cellu - lar defense against ROS that forms a dimer with a disulﬁde bond ( GSSG ) upon oxidation . The ratio of GSH to GSSG is a marker of the redox state of the cell and is reduced when the cells experience an oxidative stress . We measured this ratio to determine if the ROS generated by CMS caused changes in the redox state of 16HBE cells . Figure 3 shows that 0 . 5 h of CMS caused a signiﬁcant reduction in the normalized GSH - to - GSSG ratio to 50 . 8 (cid:7) 4 . 4 % of the 0 - h control ( P (cid:8) 0 . 05 , n (cid:9) 4 ) . The GSH - to - GSSG ratio remained signiﬁcantly reduced through 24 h , reaching 40 . 5 (cid:7) 7 . 5 % of control at its lowest point after 24 h of CMS indicating a persistent oxidative stress . Thus , although O 2 (cid:1) production had returned to control levels after 24 h of CMS ( Fig . 2 ) , the ratio of GSH to GSSG remained signiﬁcantly reduced . O 2 (cid:1) production is dependent on the magnitude of CMS . To determine whether increased O 2 (cid:1) production was dependent on the magnitude of CMS , 16HBE cells were stretched for 2 h at 10 , 15 , 20 , and 30 % strain , and the O 2 (cid:1) production was measured by DHE ﬂuorescence . Figure 4 shows that 10 % CMS did not signiﬁcantly increase O 2 (cid:1) production , but levels of strain 15 % and higher resulted in signiﬁcant increases after 2 h of strain . Mitochondrially derived O 2 (cid:1) is partially responsible for cyclic mechanical strain - induced production of O 2 (cid:1) . Mitochon - dria are the largest source of intracellular ROS production from normal cell respiration and have been implicated in ROS production stimulated by mechanical deformation of endothe - lial cells ( 2 , 21 ) . To investigate whether stretch - induced O 2 (cid:1) production was the result of increased mitochondrial genera - tion , we treated 16HBE cells with the complex I inhibitor rotenone . As shown in Fig . 5 , rotenone ( 25 (cid:2) M ) partially but signiﬁcantly inhibited the enhanced O 2 (cid:1) production afte r 2 h of CMS from 143 . 7 (cid:7) 4 . 8 to 120 . 7 (cid:7) 2 . 5 % ( P (cid:8) 0 . 05 , n (cid:9) 6 ) , but the response was still signiﬁcantly greater than control ( P (cid:8) 0 . 05 , n (cid:9) 6 ) . Cells treated with the vehicle used to solubilize the rotenone ( chloroform ) demonstrated a response similar to that of untreated controls after 2 h of CMS ( 138 . 2 (cid:7) 6 . 6 % , P (cid:8) 0 . 05 , n (cid:9) 3 ) . These results suggest that at least part of the increased O 2 (cid:1) production was generated by the mitochondria . Mitochondria are deformed by mechanical strain . Although increased mitochondrial production of O 2 (cid:1) has been previously reported in endothelial cells ( 2 , 21 ) , the mechanism of stimu - lation is not known . To investigate whether increased mito - chondrial production of O 2 (cid:1) was initiated by direct deformation of the mitochondria , we examined mitochondria in live cells labeled with a mitochondrial speciﬁc dye , MitoTracker Or - ange . Labeled cells were imaged before and during the appli - Fig . 3 . Glutathione ( GSH ) oxidation increased in 16HBE after CMS . The GSH - to - oxidized GSH ( GSSG ) ratio was determined after 0 , 0 . 5 , 2 , 6 , 12 , or 24 h ( n (cid:9) 6 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 4 , and 4 , respectively ) of stretch at 20 % strain and 30 cpm .

As indicted in Fig . 6 , mitochondria were observed to distend as the Silastic membrane was strained biaxially by 17 % . Measurements made of the total length of selected mitochondria ( 6 mitochondria from 4 different ﬁelds ) increased from 3 . 1 (cid:7) 0 . 6 to 4 . 1 (cid:7) 0 . 7 (cid:2) m ( 32 . 1 % linear strain ) , indicating local deformation when a global strain was applied . The observed mitochondrial deformation may contrib - ute to initiation of strain - induced O 2 (cid:1) production . NADPH oxidase activity is increased by cyclic mechanical strain . We next investigated whether NADPH oxidase contrib - uted to the stretch - induced production of ROS in pulmonary epithelial cells . NADPH oxidase has previously been impli - cated in the ROS produced by CMS of endothelial cells ( 3 , 24 , 29 , 48 ) and vascular smooth muscle cells ( 22 , 31 ) . As shown in Fig . 7 , cyclic stretch of 16HBE cells signiﬁcantly increased the activity of NADPH oxidase to 204 . 8 (cid:7) 27 . 8 % relative to unstretched controls ( P (cid:8) 0 . 05 , n (cid:9) 6 ) . Also , the normalized activity of NADPH oxidase was reduced to near background levels when 10 (cid:2) M DPI was added to the chemiluminescence reaction solution of cell homogenates exposed to either 0 or 2 h of CMS . The chemiluminescence signal was the same as background if cell homogenate was added to the reaction cocktail without NADPH ( data not shown ) . DISCUSSION A recent study demonstrated that mechanical ventilation with lower tidal volumes reduced the mortality of ARDS patients ( 40 ) , and these ﬁndings are supported by studies demonstrating that lower tidal volume settings decreased injury to epithelial and endothelial cells in ventilated rats ( 12 ) and decreased inﬂammation in a mouse model of VILI ( 5 , 46 ) . Thus higher tidal volumes may contribute to VILI through mechanisms related to overdistention of the lungs . We hypoth - esized that overdistention of the lung epithelium leads to increased production of ROS that may contribute to VILI . We exposed pulmonary epithelial cells to CMS and measured the production of O 2 (cid:1) with DHE . We found that O 2 (cid:1) production was signiﬁcantly increased after 2 h of CMS of 16HBE , A549 , and primary rat AT II cells compared with static controls ( see Fig . 1 B ) . We examined O 2 (cid:1) production to focus our study on the potential initial events stimulated by mechanical stretch . CMS of A549 cells has been shown previously to increase generation of ROS . Upadhyay et al . ( 42 ) demonstrated that A549 cells stretched fo r 1 h at 30 % biaxial elongation and 30 cpm increased generation of H 2 O 2 by 25 % compared with static controls ( 42 ) . In that study , the cells were loaded with DCFH , which is oxidized to the ﬂuorescent compound dichlo - roﬂuorescein by H 2 O 2 . H 2 O 2 is one of several downstream metabolites of O 2 (cid:1) generation . We measured a greater increase in ROS production by A549 cells using DHE after 2 h of CMS ( Fig . 1 B ) . The lower increase in ROS production detected by Upadhyay et al . ( 42 ) may be because of the metabolism of O 2 (cid:1) to other pathways not detected by DCFH . In addition , DCFH has been reported to leak out of cells ( 37 ) and in preliminary experiments we too observed leakage of DCFH from cells . Fig . 6 .

Oxidized DHE binds to DNA and ﬂuoresces , and thus the ﬂuorescent dye remains inside the cells . We loaded the dye after the stretch concluded , reducing potential leakage of the DHE dye . Differences between our study and previous studies could also be because of the duration of the stretch . We measured changes in ROS production over time in 16HBE cells ( Fig . 2 ) and found that CMS of 0 . 5 h did not elicit an increase in O 2 (cid:1) production , but 2 h caused a signiﬁcant in - crease . Although we did not measure ROS production after 1 h of CMS in A549 cells , the response may be similar to that reported by Upadhyay et al . ( 42 ) . Other investigators have used DHE to monitor changes in O 2 (cid:1) production in human lung endothelial cells exposed to hyperoxia ( 35 ) , nutrient - deprived human aortic endothelial cells ( 28 ) , and ANG II treatment of bovine aortic endothelial cells ( 9 ) . Lopez et al . ( 28 ) used images of DHE staining to quantify changes in the generation of O 2 (cid:1) with nutrient depri - vation . We used a similar method to quantify changes in the current study . Parinandi et al . ( 35 ) used cell lysate ﬂuorescence from DHE - loaded cells to measure changes in O 2 (cid:1) production . O 2 (cid:1) production has also been measured by an HPLC method in cells and intact tissues ( 9 ) based on the ﬂuorescence of oxo - ethidium . This study also demonstrated the speciﬁcity of DHE for O 2 (cid:1) by showing that ﬂuorescence was not increased after treatment with H 2 O 2 , peroxynitrite , or hypochlorous acid . ROS generation caused by CMS resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction of the ratio of GSH to GSSG in 16HBE cells , indicating an oxidant stress that occurred as early as 0 . 5 h , and the ratio remained signiﬁcantly reduced through 24 h ( see Fig . 3 ) . An increase in ROS production as a result of CMS was not observed in 16HBE cells until 2 h ofstrain , as measured by DHE ﬂuorescence ( see Fig . 4 ) , but the GSH - to - GSSG ratio indicated an oxidant stress after only 0 . 5 h of stretch . This implies that the cellular antioxidant defenses were able to absorb the excess ROS before being overwhelmed by 2 h , resulting in an increase in DHE ﬂuorescence . However , after 24 h , DHE measurements returned to basal levels , whereas the GSH - to - GSSG ratio remained signiﬁcantly reduced . Jafari et al . ( 23 ) measured GSH levels in A549 cells and found that levels were signiﬁcantly reduced after 1 h of CMS at 15 % strain and 20 cpm , returned to basal levels after 2 and 3 h , but showed a signiﬁcant increase after 4 h of CMS . Ourresults corroborate their ﬁndings of an early oxidant stress caused by CMS . However , in our study , although the ratio of GSH to GSSG decreased , reduced GSH levels were maintained at a constant level in 16HBE cells subjected to CMS with no signiﬁcant changes over 24 h , whereas total GSH levels in - creased signiﬁcantly after 24 h , resulting in the continued reduction in the ratio ( data not shown ) . This may not fully explain the reduction in O 2 (cid:1) after 24 h , but we did not investigate activity or protein levels of antioxidants more speciﬁc to O 2 (cid:1) such as superoxide dismutase . Increased levels of superoxide dismutase after 24 h might account for the decrease in O 2 (cid:1) production with the sustained decrease in the GSH - to - GSSG ratio . Differences between antioxidant systems in 16HBE and A549 cells may also contribute to the observed differences . However , measurement of both GSH and GSSG levels is important to assess the redox state of the cells . We explored the effects of varying the magnitude of strain on ROS production of pulmonary epithelial cells and found that application of strain levels (cid:8) 15 % elongation resulted in O 2 (cid:1) production that was not signiﬁcantly different from control . Ap - plication of strain levels (cid:2) 15 % caused signiﬁcant increases in ROS production ( Fig . 4 ) . To our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst time ROS production has been studied as a function of the magnitude of strain in pulmonary epithelial cells . These results suggest that a threshold level of strain exists above which elevated ROS pro - duction occurs . The strain levels experienced by the lungs in vivo during either spontaneous breathing or mechanical ventilation are difﬁcult to determine . Tschumperlin and Margulies ( 41 ) measured the changes in epithelial basement membrane surface area ( EBMSA ) of lungs ﬁxed at different inﬂations and found the expected nonlinear response . Inﬂation from 24 % to total lung capacity ( TLC ) caused a 40 % increase in EBMSA , whereas inﬂation from 42 % of TLC to TLC resulted in a 34 % increase . This change in surface area corresponds to a linear strain of (cid:6) 18 % . In injured lungs , some regions may be collapsed or ﬂuid - ﬁlled , functionally reducing the volume of the lungs . There - fore , during mechanical ventilation , the remaining volume of the lungs may be signiﬁcantly overinﬂated , causing even greater distention and injury ( 20 ) . However , the actual levels of strain in the airways and alveoli in injured lungs have not been well characterized . Some authors have suggested that linear strain of (cid:6) 10 % occurs during normal breathing and that higher levels occur during high tidal volume mechanical ventilation , but there are no direct measurements of this . Our results showed that ROS production was signiﬁcantly increased at strains of 15 % or greater . During mechanical ventilation at high tidal volumes or even during lower tidal volumes , if the lung volume is effectively reduced by injury , the average distention of the tissue may be above this threshold and cause generation of ROS from the epithelium . In this study , we were unable to stretch the primary rat AT II cells at 20 % elongation and 30 cpm because signiﬁcant detachment of the cells from the membrane occurred . There - fore , the values reported in Fig . 1 B for rat AT II cells are from cells stretched at 15 % strain and 15 cpm on day 2 of culture , and the cells remained attached under these conditions . Oswari et al . ( 33 ) showed a substantial loss of viability ( 49 % ) in rat AT II cells cultured for 1 day on ﬁbronectin - coated Silastic and exposed t o 1 h of CMS of 25 % change in surface area ( (cid:6) 12 % linear strain ) and 15 cpm . However , treatment with keratino - cyte growth factor or culture of the cells on a matrix deposited by AT II cells for 5 days resulted in levels of viability similar to static controls . We are currently adapting our culture meth - ods to better promote attachment and survival at increased strain and frequency . Despite the lower strain and frequency of stretch , we observed a signiﬁcant stimulation of ROS produc - tion , albeit at a lower level than that seen in the cell lines tested . The source of mechanical strain - or shear stress - induced ROS is currently debated , and potential sources in different cell types include NADPH oxidase ( 7 , 13 , 29 , 30 ) , xanthine oxidase ( 30 ) , nitric oxide synthase , and the mitochondria ( 2 , 21 ) . Previous studies with endothelial cells concluded that the source of ROS was primarily NADPH oxidase , since treatment with the ﬂavoprotein inhibitor DPI abolished the response . However , DPI is a nonspeciﬁc inhibitor of NADPH oxidase that also inhibits other potential sources of ROS generation , including the enzymes of the electron transport chain in mito - L839 STRAIN INCREASES ROS PRODUCTION IN PEC AJP - Lung Cell Mol Physiol • VOL 289 • NOVEMBER 2005 • www . ajplung . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 4 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 h tt p : / / a j p l ung . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m chondria . Recent studies have demonstrated that mitochondria are involved in strain - induced production of ROS in endothe - lial cells . Ichimura et al . ( 21 ) and Ali et al . ( 2 ) have shown that the complex I inhibitor rotenone eliminated strain - induced ROS production . Ali et al . also used ethidium - treated human umbilical vein endothelial cell cultures to eliminate mitochon - drial DNA and the electron transport chain proteins and found that the CMS - induced increase in ROS production was elimi - nated . A more speciﬁc pharmacological inhibitor of NADPH oxidase , apocynin , was employed and was found to have no effect on CMS - induced ROS generation . We found that CMS of 16HBE cells stimulated NADPH oxidase activity and that ROS production was partially sensitive to inhibition of mito - chondrial complex I . The activity of NADPH oxidase , mea - sured by Lucigenin chemiluminescence , increased signiﬁcantly afte r 2 h of CMS ( Fig . 6 ) . Treatment of the cell lysates with DPI ( 10 (cid:2) M ) inhibited the increase in activity and reduced the activity in static cell lysates to similar levels . The speciﬁcity of the response was tested by comparing results with and without an excess of NADPH ( 50 (cid:2) M ) in the reaction mixture . Chemi - luminescent readings were similar to background when NADPH was not included in the reaction cocktail ( data not shown ) . Rotenone partially inhibited CMS - induced increases in DHE ﬂuorescence ( Fig . 5 ) . Taken together , our results suggest that CMS - induced increases in ROS production are the result of both NADPH oxidase and mitochondrial generation in pulmonary epithelial cells . If mitochondrial production of O 2 (cid:1) is stimulated by mechanical stretch , then what is the initiating event ? We hypothesized that global strain applied to the cells may lead to direct distention of the mitochondria , since mitochondria are attached to both the actin ( 39 ) and microtubule ( 16 , 17 ) components of the cytoskel - eton . We observed substantial deformation of mitochondrial struc - tures when cells were stretched ( Fig . 7 ) . We speculate that mechanical distention of mitochondrial structures may activate pathways that lead to generation of ROS . For example , mitochon - drial ATP - sensitive K (cid:5) ( K ATP (cid:5) ) activation has been linked to generation of ROS ( 11 , 15 ) , and activation of the mitochondrial K ATP (cid:5) channel has been linked to mitochondrial swelling ( 18 ) . However , the mechanism of ROS production through activa - tion of the mitochondrial K ATP (cid:5) channel has not been deter - mined , and no studies have connected the distention caused by mitochondrial swelling to ROS production . One of the major limitations of our measurements of mitochondrial deformation is that the images that were analyzed ( Fig . 6 ) were from a single plane of focus . Because we did not collect images at different z - planes , we cannot exclude the possibility that the change in length that was observed was due to the appearance of mitochondrial structures from out - of - focus planes in the images of stretched cells . However , these images were not taken with a confocal microscope , and thus contributions from multiple planes are more likely to appear in the image . In addition , 16HBE cells are quite thin , and we speciﬁcally identiﬁed mitochondrial structures that were in more conﬁned areas near the cell boarder or beneath the nucleus , making the possibility of out - of - plane regions appearing in the focal plane less likely . These considerations , however , still do not rule out the possibility that apparent deformation was the result of the appearance of out - of - focus structures . One proposed mechanism for VILI is that increased mechan - ical deformation of lung tissue stimulates an acute inﬂamma - tory response characterized by increased levels of proinﬂam - matory cytokines and inﬂammatory cell inﬁltration . In previ - ous studies , high tidal volume mechanical ventilation without underlying lung injury led to both increased cytokine produc - tion ( 46 ) and enhanced neutrophil inﬁltration ( 5 ) . CMS has been shown to stimulate production of proinﬂammatory cyto - kines in both airway and alveolar cells . CMS of BEAS - 2B , an airway epithelial cell line , resulted in an increased production of interleukin ( IL ) - 8 ( 34 ) . A549 cells when subjected to CMS increased production of proinﬂammatory cytokines IL - 8 ( 23 , 27 , 43 , 49 ) , IL - 6 ( 23 ) , and transforming growth factor - (cid:10) ( 49 ) . Primary cultures of rat AT II also exhibited CMS - induced production of IL - 8 ( 36 ) . Exposure to H 2 O 2 or exogenous O 2 (cid:1) production by xanthine / xanthine oxidase and exposure of rat AT II cells to hyperoxia also caused increased production of the proinﬂammatory cytokines IL - 1 (cid:10) , IL - 6 , and tumor necrosis factor - (cid:11) ( 14 ) . Ali et al . ( 2 ) demonstrated that stretch - induced expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 and activation of NF - (cid:12) B could be abrogated by blocking mitochondrial gen - eration of ROS in endothelial cells . Thus inﬂammatory re - sponses may be initiated by stretch - induced production of ROS . We demonstrated in this study that stretch stimulated increased ROS production in both airway and alveolar epithe - lial cells , that the response was both time varying and magni - tude dependent , and that ROS are derived from both NADPH oxidase and mitochondria .
