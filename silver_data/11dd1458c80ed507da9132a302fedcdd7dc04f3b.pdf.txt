p53 beyond region 2 ( Fig . 3 , B and C ) , as indi - cated by p53Rps expression in region 3 of the germarium and later - staged egg chambers , where a substantial increase in the incidence of reporter activation was observed ( Fig . 3C ) . To test whether persistent p53 activation is functionally relevant , we examined animals doubly mutated for p53 and rad54 . p53 − / − , rad54 AA / RU females were sterile , despite the fact that corresponding trans - allelic combinations of the single - gene mutants were fertile ( see methods for allele descriptions ) . Fur - thermore , severe oogenesis defects , which are not seen in single mutants , were evident in double mutants , including abnormal numbers of nurse cell nuclei ( Fig . 3D ) and shortened egg lengths ( fig . S5 ) . To test whether genetic interactions between p53 and rad54 were instigated by meiotic recombination , we created spo11 , p53 , rad54 triple mutants . In these animals , fertility and normal nursecellnumberswererestored ( Fig . 3 , DandE ) , and defects in egg length were suppressed ( fig . S5 ) . Hence , genetic interactions between p53 and rad54 required the action of spo11 . Furthermore , these results indicate that failure to properly resolve meiotic recombination can lead to sus - tained and functionally relevant p53 activity . To determine whether activation of p53 by meiotic recombination is conserved , we examined mouse testes with antibodies that specifically detect phosphorylated p53 at Ser15 ( 18 ) . In semi - niferous tubules from wild - type ( WT ) animals , p53 was transiently activated in early spermato - cytes ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . On the basis of nuclear morphology ( described in supplemental methods ) , staining appeared to peak between the leptotene and zygotene stages and disappeared after the early pachytene stage . This pattern is consistent with earlier studies on Spo11 activity ( 19 ) and p53 promoter – driven chloramphenicol acetyltransfer - ase transgenes in this tissue ( 20 ) . Staining for phospho - p53 ( Ser15 ) was absent from testes of Spo11 - deficient mice ( Fig . 4 , B and C ) , where spermatocytes survive through the leptotene and zygotene stages ( 21 ) . Therefore , we can exclude cell loss as a reason for the absence of signal , and , as in flies , meiotic recombination is necessary to provoke p53 activation . We demonstrate that a defining step in sexual reproduction , meiosis , signals a programmed burst of p53 activation . This activity is stimulated by the action of Spo11 in Drosophila females ( re - combination does notoccur in males ) and in mice . In flies , activation requires the kinase chk2 [ which also has roles later in oogenesis ( 22 ) ] but appears to be independent of the ATM and ATR kinases ( fig . S3 ) , suggesting that alternative transducers couldmediate Spo11 - dependentactivationofp53 . In mice ( Fig . 4 ) , potential functions of Spo11 - mediated activation of p53 are indicated by altered kinetics of gametogenesis in p53 - deficient mice ( 23 , 24 ) , as well as giant - cell degenerative syndrome in the testes of p53 - deficient males ( 25 ) and implantation defects in females ( 26 ) . Addi - tional layers of complexity or redundant activities conferred by the p63 and p73 paralogs ( 27 , 28 ) could obscure conserved functions , because re - combination appeared normal without p53 ( 29 ) . Nevertheless , these findings raise the possibility that the act of recombination during meiosis may have been an intrinsic primordial stimulus that shaped ancestral features of the p53 regulatory network . Future studies could elucidate whether p53 directly affects crossover reactions ( 30 ) or imposes quality control on selected gametes . References and Notes 1 . C . J . Brown , S . Lain , C . S .

McMahon ‡ Clathrin - mediated endocytosis , the major pathway for ligand internalization into eukaryotic cells , is thought to be initiated by the clustering of clathrin and adaptors around receptors destined for internalization . However , here we report that the membrane - sculpting F - BAR domain – containing Fer / Cip4 homology domain - only proteins 1 and 2 ( FCHo1 / 2 ) were required for plasma membrane clathrin - coated vesicle ( CCV ) budding and marked sites of CCV formation . Changes in FCHo1 / 2 expression levels correlated directly with numbers of CCV budding events , ligand endocytosis , and synaptic vesicle marker recycling . FCHo1 / 2 proteins bound specifically to the plasma membrane and recruited the scaffold proteins eps15 and intersectin , which in turn engaged the adaptor complex AP2 . The FCHo F - BAR membrane - bending activity was required , leading to the proposal that FCHo1 / 2 sculpt the initial bud site and recruit the clathrin machinery for CCV formation . C lathrin - mediated endocytosis is the pro - cess by which cargo is internalized into vesicles with the aid of adaptors [ such as the adaptor protein complex 2 ( AP2 ) ] and the coat - protein clathrin ( 1 , 2 ) . Amphiphysins and sorting nexin 9 probably recruit the membrane scission protein dynamin to membranes of high curvature by their N - terminal BAR ( Bin / Amphi - physin / Rvs ) domains ( 3 , 4 ) . We investigated the possibility that membrane - sculpting proteins play www . sciencemag . org SCIENCE VOL 328 4 JUNE 2010 1281 REPORTS on J une 8 , 20 10 www . sc i en c e m ag . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m an early role in invagination even before AP2 and clathrin recruitment . We studied the F - BAR – containing protein family FCHo1 / 2 [ Fer / Cip4 homology domain - only ( FCHo ) proteins 1 and 2 ] , whose F - BAR homodimer module can recognize less extreme curvatures than BAR modules ( 5 – 7 ) . FCHo1 / 2 are ubiquitously expressed ( fig . S1 , A and B ) and have a twisted shape that is distinct fromtheF - BARdimersof FBP17andCIP4 ( 5 – 7 ) . The yeast homolog Syp1 is recruited early to sites of actin - dependent endocytosis ( 8 – 10 ) . We con - firmed that FCHo1 / 2 are localized to clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) only on the plasma membrane ( PM ) ( fig . S1 , C to F ) . Furthermore , a FCHo signal defined where a CCP forms because it was detected before the visible appearance of clathrin or its PM - specific adaptor , AP2 ( Fig . 1 , A and C , and fig . S2 , A and B ) . The FCHo1 / 2 signal decreased before the clathrin signal intensity reached its maximum , but in some rare cases the FCHo protein did not leave and defined sites where clathrin returned multiple times , thus marking endocytic “ hotspots ” ( fig . S2C ) . In contrast , FBP17 — another F - BAR protein impli - cated in clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( 6 ) — was recruited at later stages to some ( 3 T 1 % ) CCPs ( fig . S2E ) . FCHo2 was detected with cryogenic im - munoelectron microscopy ( cryoimunno - EM ) at early to late stages of CCPs , which is consistent with live cell imaging kymographs ( Fig . 1B ) . A complete loss of CCPs was observed when FCHo1 + 2 levels were greatly reduced by using double RNA interference ( RNAi ) ( Fig . 1 , C and D , and fig . S3 , A to D ) with a concomitant reduc - tion in internalization of three known cargoes for clathrin - mediated endocytosis : transferrin ( Tf ) , low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , and epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) ( Fig . 1E ) . In the absence of FCHo proteins , both AP2 and clathrin were cytosolic . These phenotypes were rescued by an RNAi - resistant form of FCHo2 ( Fig . 1 , C to E , and fig . S3E ) ( 11 ) . FCHo1 / 2 function was not limited tofibroblastsbutwasalsoassociatedwith clathrin - mediated endocytosis in primary astrocytes and the recycling of synaptic vesicle markers ( synaptotagmin1 and synaptophysin ) after stimu - lated exocytosis in hippocampal neurons cultured for 4 days in vitro ( fig . S4 ) . Overexpression of FCHo1 or FCHo2 led to a dramatic increase in CCPdensity . Thisincreasewasnotduetoslowedor inhibited clathrin - coated vesicle ( CCV ) budding [ as with epsin1 overexpression ( fig . S5B ) or dynamin inhibition by dynasore ( 12 ) ] because CCPs were dynamic ( increased nucleation rate ) and func - tional ( increased Tf uptake ) during FCHo1 or 2 overexpression ( Fig . 1 , F to H , fig . S5 , and movie S1 ) . Because CCP numbers directly correlate with FCHo1 / 2 levels , FCHo proteins appear to act as CCP nucleators . The presence of a membrane - bending protein early in CCP formation caused us to seek an ex - planation for how FCHo1 / 2 recruitment connects to clathrin recruitment . We looked for FCHo2 C - terminal AP2 - m homology domain ( m HD ) inter - actors in brain and HeLa cell extracts and found that the main interaction partners were known CCP proteinseps15 , eps15R , and intersectin 1 and 2 ( Fig . 2A and fig . S6 , A and B ) . The interaction of eps15 with the m HD was direct ( fig . S6C ) ( 8 ) aswasthatwithintersectin1 . TheCCPlocalization ofeps15andintersectinwasdependentonFCHo1 / 2 ( Fig . 2B ) . These proteins interact directly with AP2 but not with clathrin , unlike many other CCV accessory proteins ( 2 ) . Eps15 and intersectin appearance coincided with that of FCHo2 ( Fig . 2C ) , suggesting that these proteins constitute an early module for nascent CCP assembly . FCHo1 / 2 are necessary for CCP formation , and yet their fluorescent intensity diminished before vesicle budding ( Fig . 1A ) , just as dynamin intensity in - creased ( fig . S6D ) . Similarly , the yeast Syp1 intensity decreased as Abp1 increased ( 9 , 10 ) . In purified CCVs , FCHo1 / 2 , eps15 , and intersectin levels were reduced as compared with that of total extracts ( Fig . 2D and fig . S6E ) , which is consistent with their absence in previous mass spectrometry studies ( 13 ) . Thus , FCHo1 / 2 initiate CCPs but are excluded from mature vesicles , with FCHo1 / 2 being primarily PM - associated , which is consistent with their localization on constricted CCP necks ( Fig . 2E ) . RNAi of AP2 leads to a marked reduction in CCP numbers ( 14 ) . Thus , we tested the localization Medical Research Council , Laboratory of Molecular Biology ( MRC - LMB ) , Hills Road , Cambridge CB2 0QH , UK . * Present address : Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology , Cornell University , Ithaca , NY 14853 , USA . † These authors contributed equally to this work . ‡ To whom correspondence should be addressed .

Although AP2 puncta were largely missing , FCHo2 puncta at the PM remained and still colocalized with eps15 and intersectin ( Fig . 2G and fig . S7A ) . The FCHo2 - m HD interactions were also AP2 - independent in vitro ( Fig . 2F and fig . S7B ) . In contrast , the lo - calization of epsin , another membrane - sculpting molecule that binds clathrin and AP2 , was depen - dent on the presence of AP2 ( fig . S7C ) . An alter - native strategy to disrupt CCP formation is the overexpression of the C terminus of AP180 , which binds to clathrin with high affinity ( 15 ) . Over - expression led to an accumulation of AP2 puncta , which colocalized with FCHo2 , eps15 , and inter - sectin but had no clathrin and were static ( fig . S7 , DtoF ) . ThusFCHo2 , eps15 , andintersectindonot requireAP2orclathrintocluster . Aneps15 / eps15R / intersectin1 / intersectin2 quadruple knockdown af - fected FCHo2 clustering into puncta but not its PM localization , whereas AP2 was cytosolic ( Fig . 2H and fig . S8 , A to E ) . RNAi of Dab2 , a m HD interaction partner that arrives early at CCPs ( figs . S6A and S8F ) and that was not enriched in CCVs ( Fig . 2D ) , did not lead to a reduction in CCPs ( fig . S8 , F and G ) . Thus , eps15 and intersectin cluster FCHo1 / 2 to define nascent sites of CCP nucle - ation . Mutation of K797 in FCHo2 m HD [ a conservedresiduethatisequivalenttowhereAP2 - b interacts with AP2 - m in pdb : 2VGL ( fig . S9A ) ] ( 16 , 17 ) abolished interactions with eps15 and intersectins ( Fig . 2Jand fig . S9B ) . In theFCHo1 + 2 RNAi background , K797E did not rescue CCP formationand Tf uptake andwasdiffusely located on the PM ( Fig . 2I ) . Thus , FCHo membrane recruitment and clustering by eps15 and intersec - tins initiates CCP maturation with subsequent recruitment of AP2 and clathrin , leading to coated vesicle formation . . Functionality of F - BAR domains is mediated by three distinct properties : membrane binding , dimerization , and membrane sculpting ( 5 , 6 , 18 ) . To test the importance of each property in FCHo2 function , we designed ( i ) a chimera to replace the F - BAR domain with a PM - targeting PH domain , which dimerizes because of an enhanced green fluorescentprotein ( EGFP ) tag ( 19 ) ; ( ii ) astructure - based mutant of FCHo2 ( F38E + W73E ) , which should disrupt dimer formation ; and ( iii ) a fluo - rescently tagged SGIP1 , which is a close relative of FCHo1 / 2 and a CCP component that has a C - terminal m HD but no F - BAR domain ( 20 ) . All three proteins localized to CCPs in wild - type cells ( fig . S10A ) but upon depletion of endogenous FCHo1 + 2didnotrescueCCPformation ( Fig . 3A ) . As expected , both the PH chimera and SGIP1 localized to the PM ( sometimes in large sheets ) , whereasthedimermutantremainedcytosolic . Thus , the dimeric , membrane - sculpting F - BAR module is necessary for CCP formation . The region fol - lowing theFCHo1 / 2F - BARdomain ( residues263 to 430 ) is rich in positively charged amino acids and has a high homology with the N terminus of SGIP1 ( 9 ) . An extended F - BAR module contain - ing this homology region ( F - BAR - x , for “ ex - tended ” ) , showed enhanced membrane binding and tubulation in vitro ( fig . S10 , B and C ) . The F - BAR - x module co - sedimented preferentially withliposomes enrichedwithphosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate [ PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] , helping to explain why FCHo proteins are PM - targeted ( Fig . 3B ) . Acute decrease of cellular PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels by the addition of 1 - butanol ( 21 ) led to acute relocaliza - tion of FCHo2 to the cytosol ( fig . S10D ) , sup - porting the role of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the targeting of FCHo1 / 2 to the PM . The F - BAR - x module caused extensive tubulation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 liposomes to high curvatures ( from 130 - to 18 - nm tubules and many small vesicles ) in a protein concentration – dependent manner ( Fig . 3C ) . Protein density sur - rounding tubules sometimes exhibited striations in which the angle correlated with the degree of membrane curvature ( fig . S10E and movie S2 ) . Narrower tubules displayed more oblique angles , Fig . 2 . FCHo2 directly binds and recruits eps15 and intersectin to initiate CCP maturation . ( A ) Pull - down with GST - FCHo2 - m HD and rat brain lysate . Interacting proteins were identified by means of mass spectrometry . ( B ) Eps15 and intersectin ( ITSN ) formed puncta at the PM , colocalizing with FCHo2 . In double FCHo1 + 2 RNAi cells , eps15 and ITSN were cytosolic ( contrast was enhanced so as to show the diffuse signal ) ; co - expression of RNAi - resistant FCHo2 ( FCHo2r ) rescued PM - targeting ( Rescue ) .

( G ) Upon AP2 depletion ( m 2 RNAi ) , s 2 - GFP ( another AP2 subunit ) was cytosolic ( contrast was enhanced so as to show the diffuse signal ) , but Eps15 and ITSN still colocalize with FCHo2 at the PM ( arrows ) . ( H ) FCHo2 and AP2 ( s 2 - GFP ) puncta disappeared under Eps15 + Eps15R + ITSN1 + ITSN2 quadruple RNAi . AP2 became cytosolic ( diffuse signal ) , whereas FCHo2 remained at the PM ( inset ) . ( I ) In FCHo1 + 2 RNAi cells , RNAi - resistant FCHo2 - K797E ( FCHo2r - K797E ) bound to the PM ( arrows ) but did not cluster nor rescue CCP formation , as reported by means of RFP - LCa ( clathrin ) . In these cells , FCHo1 + 2 RNAi inhibition of Tf uptake was also not rescued [ 7 . 2 T 3 . 5 % of control uptake ( P < 0 . 0001 ) ] .

This provides a mechanistic explanation for the generation of increasing curvature required for CCP budding and dynamin recruitment . To test the contribution of membrane sculpting in FCHo2 function , we mutated two conserved ly - sines ( K146E + K165E ) on the concave face of the F - BAR module as well as a conserved residue ( I268N ) associated with a macrophage - induced autoimmune disease ( 22 ) and its interacting res - idue ( L136E ) along the F - BAR “ wing ” ( fig . S11 , A and B ) . As expected , the K146E + K165E mu - tant displayed reduced membrane binding in vitro and relocalized to the cytosol , whereas I268N and L136E mutations did not abrogate membrane binding but failed to tubulate the PM ( fig . S11 , C and D ) . When placed into full - length FCHo2 , I268N and L136E induced enlarged and static aberrant CCPs and could not rescue FCHo1 + 2 RNAi - induced Tf uptake defect ( Fig . 3E ) . Thus , FCHo2 - mediated membrane sculpting is essen - tial for normal CCP nucleation . We showed that FCHo1 / 2 proteins nucleate CCPs and that AP2 is a later component recruit - ingclathrin , cargo , andaccessoryproteins ( fig . S12 ) . We also uncovered a role for membrane sculpting in the initiation of clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Thus , curvature generation appears to be funda - mental to PM CCV formation from neurons to fi - broblasts , and FCHo1 and - 2 represent key initial proteins that ultimately control cellular nutrient uptake , receptor regulation , and synaptic vesicle retrieval .

Full length mouse FCHo2 ( Riken AK142282 ) and human FCHo1 ( IMAGE 5757146 ) were cloned into pGEX6P1 and pEGFP ( Clontech ) , pTagRFP , and pTagBFP vectors ( Evrogen ) . We introduced a point mutation ( S158T ) rendering TagRFP more photostable ( S1 ) into the pTagRFP plasmids used for all TagRFP constructs of this study . For simplicity EGFP , TagRFP and TagBFP are called ' GFP ' , ' RFP ' and BFP ' in the text and figures . Mammalian expression of untagged constructs of FCHo1 and FCHo2 used in the titration experiments ( Fig . 1F‐H and S5 ) were generated by cloning into pEGFP‐N3 with a stop codon introduced by mutagenesis before the EGFP sequence and verified by sequencing . The F‐BAR ( 1‐262 ) , F‐BAR‐x ( 1‐327 ) , extended region “x” ( 263‐430 ) , and µ HD ( 525‐809 ) of FCHo2 were cloned separately . The FCHo2 chimera was generated by inserting the middle region and µ HD of FCHo2 ( 395‐809 ) into a construct expressing EGFP‐PLC δ PH domain ( 1‐175 ) at its N‐ terminus , a kind gift of Matilda Katan ( S2 ) , plus a 17 amino acid linker region . The RNAi‐ resistant form of FCHo2 used in the ' rescue ' experiments was generated by introducing the following mutations D310D ( GAT‐GAC ) , A311L ( GCA‐TTA ) and L314L ( CTT‐TTG ) . Rat EGFP‐ LCa ( Clathrin Light chain a ) was a kind gift of Margaret Robinson ( University of Cambridge , UK ) . RFP‐LCa was generated by transfer of the LCa gene into pTagRFP . EGFP‐ intersectin ( ITSN ) 1L was a kind gift from Peter McPherson ( McGill University , Canada ) ( S3 ) . RFP‐ITSN , and BFP‐ITSN were generated by transfer of the intersectin 1L gene into pTagRFP and pTagBFP vectors , respectively . Human eps15 ( 1‐896 ) was cloned from a construct from Alexandre Benmerah ( Institut Cochin , Paris ) ( S4 , S5 ) and transferred into pEGFP , pTagRFP or pTagBFP vectors to generate GFP‐eps15 , RFP‐eps15 and BFP‐eps15 , respectively . EGFP‐ rapostlinS ( FBP17 short form ) was a kind gift from Manabu Negishi ( Kyoto University , Japan ) ( S6 ) . SypHy ( synaptophysin‐fluorin ) was a kind gift from Leon Lagnado ( S7 ) . For testing the direct binding of eps15 to FCHo2 µ HD , a construct corresponding to the C‐terminal region ( residues 530‐791 ) of human eps15 was cloned and purified by GSH‐sepharose gel chromatography . Mouse Dab2 / p96 ( residues 1‐548 ) was cloned from a construct originally from Shelli Morris ( S8 ) . Rat Epsin1‐myc was cloned as previously described ( S9 ) . AP180 C‐ terminus ( residues 530‐915 ) , described previously ( S10 ) , was transferred into pTagBFP . Point mutations were made by PCR mutagenesis and constructs were sequenced . GST‐tagged constructs were expressed in BL21 E . coli ( Stratagene ) and purified on GSH‐sepharose beads ( GE Healthcare ) , tags were cleaved with PreScission protease ( GE Healthcare ) , and proteins were subsequently purified by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography . Clathrin‐coated vesicles ( Fig . 2D ) were enriched as in ( S11 ) . Antibodies . For Western blotting and immunofluorescence ( IF ) studies , the following antibodies were used : anti‐FCHo2 Ra103 ( in house affinity purified rabbit polyclonal raised against residues 3‐274 of human FCHo2 F‐BAR domain ) , anti‐eps15 / eps15R Ra15 ( in house rabbit polyclonal raised against human eps15 539‐896 ) , anti‐actin 6276ab ( Abcam mouse monoclonal ) , anti‐Dab2 / p96 D45720 ( mouse monoclonal , Transduction Laboratories ) , anti‐ intersectin S750 ( rabbit polyclonal , a kind gift from Tom Südhof ) , anti‐AP2 α− adaptin for IF 3 staining 2730ab ( mouse monoclonal , Abcam ) , anti‐AP2 α− adaptin for Western blotting A43920 ( mouse monoclonal , Transduction Laboratories ) , anti‐synaptophysin P38 / CL43 . 1 ( mouse monoclonal , a kind gift from Reinhart Jahn ) , anti‐clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) for immunofluorescence studies X22 ( mouse monoclonal , a kind gift from Frances Brodsky ) , anti‐ clathrin heavy chain for Western blotting 610500 ( mouse monoclonal , Transduction Laboratories ) and anti‐GFP for cryoimmuno‐electron microscopy ab290 ( rabbit polyclonal , AbCam ) , anti‐dynamin Hudy‐1 ( 05‐319 ) ( mouse monoclonal , Upstate ) , anti‐synaptotagmin1 V216 ( rabbit polyclonal monoclonal , a kind gift from Tom Südhof ) and anti‐EGFR antibody 13A9 ( mouse monoclonal , a kind gift from Genentech ) . Cryo­immuno electron microscopy ( Fig . 1B and 2E ) . HEK293T cells expressing EGFP‐FCHo2 were fixed in 2 % paraformaldehyde / 0 . 2 % glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) . The cells were pelleted in 1 % gelatine in PBS at 37°C , resuspended in 12 % gelatine in PBS , pelleted and solidified on ice . Small blocks ( ~ 0 . 5 mm ) of the cell pellet were prepared and infiltrated with 2 . 3 M sucrose at 4°C overnight , and then mounted on aluminium stubs , frozen and sectioned . The sections ( 60nm ) were picked up in drops of 2 . 3M sucrose and collected on Formvar‐coated , carbon‐coated nickel mesh grids . After blocking in 0 . 1 % BSA in PBS the sections were incubated with an anti‐GFP antibody ( 0 . 25mg / ml ; AbCam ab290 ) , washed , and incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated to 15 nm gold particles ( GE Healthcare ) . The sections were fixed in 1 % glutaraldehyde and stained with ice cold 0 . 4 % uranyl acetate / 1 . 8 % methyl cellulose ( pH 4 ) and dried . The samples were viewed in a FEI Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope . The density of gold particles in the upper and lower half ( in an area of 0 . 02µm 2 ) of 22 constricted clathrin‐coated pits was quantified using ImageJ . Cell culture , transfection , and RNAi . BSC1 cells ( ECACC 85011422 ) and HeLa cells ( ECACC 93021013 ) were cultured in DMEM‐GlutaMAX‐I media ( Gibco ) supplemented with 10 % foetal bovine serum ( FBS ) . Non‐transformed hTERT‐RPE1 cells ( Clontech ) were cultured in DMEM F12 HAM ( Sigma ) supplemented with 10 % FBS , 2mM GlutaMAX‐I ( Gibco ) and 0 . 25 % sodium bicarbonate . BSC1 cells stably expressing σ 2‐EGFP ( S12 ) were a kind gift of Tom Kirchhausen ( Harvard Medical School , USA ) . For live‐cell imaging ( see details below ) , approximately 2x10 5 cells were cultured on 35mm glass bottom dishes ( MatTek ) . Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) , using 0 . 1 - 1µg of the various plasmids ( except for the titrations ( Fig . 1F‐H and fig . S5 ) where 0 . 5 , 1 or 2 µg of plasmids were used ) . Cells were typically incubated 24 hours to express the constructs before imaging . For gene silencing experiments , siRNAs were purchased from Invitrogen ( Stealth Select siRNAs ) or Dharmacon ( ON‐ TARGETplus SMARTpool ) . RNAi oligos used were ( all human ) : FCHo2 ( HSS151016 ) , FCHo1 ( HS S118255 ) , SGIP1 ( HSS130804 ) , AP2 - µ subunit ( HSS101955 ) , Dab2 ( HSS102610 ) , intersectin1 ( HSS109703 ) , intersectin2 ( HSS121345 ) , eps15 ( HSS103327 ) , eps15R ( J‐004006‐ 05 ) , clathrin heavy chain ( CHC , HSS174637 ) , control siRNAs ( WILDE000533 ) . RNAi oligos were resuspended to a 20µM stock concentration , and delivered using Oligofectamine ( Invitrogen ) to a total final concentration of 80pM . Cells typically received two doses of siRNA with a one day interval and were used up to three days later . A final concentration of 160pM w as used when only one transfection was performed . Most cell cultures did not display complete loss of 4 the RNAi‐targeted protein , and this is likely due to the spectrum of knockdown degrees among cells in the same culture , as well as the relatively low transfection efficiency seen for the BSC1 cell line . However , the cells selected for imaging were assessed individually ( Tf uptake or co‐ transfection marker , see ' RNAi depletion’ paragraph above ) . For the GST‐µHD pull‐down experiments in µ2‐depleted HeLa lysate , cells received µ2 RNAi treatment and were FACS sorted to enrich only cells eliciting µ2 knockdown . Briefly , RNAi‐treated HeLa cells were exposed to 5mg / mL Alexa488‐transferrin ( A488‐Tf ) for 5 min at 37°C , quickly acid washed ( pH 5 . 5 , 4°C , to remove the surface‐bound A488‐Tf ) , and FACS sorted at 4°C . Only Tf neg cells ( ~ 90 % ) were collected and used for GST‐µHD pull‐down experiments . A small fraction was lyzed and blotted for AP2 α - adaptin to conf irm knockdown ( fig . S7B ) . Protein pull­down experiments . ( Fig . 2A , F and J ) . To test for interactions between proteins , GST - FCHo2 µ HD ( 525‐809 ) was produced in BL21 E . coli and purified as described above . GST‐ protein was eluted off of GSH‐sepharose beads , further purified by gel filtration , and rebound to fresh GSH‐sepharose beads for use in pull downs . HeLa cell or brain lysates ( 5‐10mg / mL ) were prepared in 150mM NaCl buffered with 20mM HEPES and 5mM DTT with added 0 . 1 % Triton X‐ 100 and a protease inhibitor cocktail ( lysis buffer ) . Bead bound protein was then exposed to cell or rat brain lysate for 30 minutes to 1 hour , pelleted in a cooled desktop centrifuge , and washed three times in lysis buffer . The final pellet was boiled in sample buffer and ran on SDS‐ PAGE . For protein identification , Coomassie Brilliant Blue‐stained protein bands were excised from the gels and underwent LC‐MS‐MS mass spectrometry for identification . Live­cell fluorescent microscopy and analysis . Cells were grown on MatTek dishes and before imaging the medium was changed to α ‐MEM without phenol red supplemented with 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 and 5 % FBS and placed into a temperature controlled chamber on the microscope stage with 95 % air : 5 % CO 2 and 100 % humidity . Live‐cell imaging data were acquired using a fully motorized inverted microscope ( Eclipse TE‐2000 , Nikon ) equipped with a CSU‐X1 spinning disk confocal head ( UltraVIEW VoX , Perkin‐Elmer , England ) using a 60x lens ( Plan Apochromat VC , 1 . 4 NA , Nikon ) under control of Volocity 5 . 0 ( Improvision , England ) . 14‐ bit digital images were obtained with a cooled EMCCD camera ( 9100‐02 , Hamamatsu , Japan ) . Four 50 mW solid‐state lasers ( 405 , 488 , 561 and 647 nm ; Crystal Laser and Melles Griots ) coupled to individual acoustic‐optical tunable filter ( AOTF ) were used as light source to excite TagBFP , EGFP , Alexa488 , TagRFP , Alexa546 and Alexa647 , as appropriate . Rapid two‐ or three‐ colours time‐lapses were acquired at 500ms to 1s intervals , using a dual ( 525 / 50 ; 640 / 120 , Chroma ) and a triple filter ( 450 / 25 ; 525 / 40 ; 600 / 35 , Chroma ) , respectively . The power of the lasers supported excitation times of 50ms in each wavelength and the AOTFs allowed minimum delay between 2 colours ( e . g . delay between green‐red for each timepoint ) , which was an important factor during the measurement of the timing of incorporation of the various CCP components we investigated . Automated unbiased identification of all clathrin or AP2 fluorescent spots and quantitative tracking of their dynamics as a function of time were performed using SlideBook 4 . 1 ( Intelligent Imaging Innovations ) following the same criteria and procedures as in ( S12 , S13 ) . 5 The graph on Fig . 1A represents 10 representative pits of equal length ( 60s ) . The fluorescence intensities ( a . u . : arbitrary units ) , corrected for their respective surrounding background , of RFP‐FCHo2 and GFP‐LCa were plotted versus time . Zero ' 0 ' values correspond to background levels ( for y‐axis , intensities ) and to the timeframe before RFP‐FCHo2 intensity became above background levels ( for x‐axis , time ) , respectively . Nucleation rates ( Fig . 1D and G , fig . S5 ) represent the number of new CCPs / 10 4 µm 2 / second . Statistical significances ( p values ) were calculated by unpaired two‐tailed Student ' s t ‐test . p values inferior to 0 . 01 were considered significant . Colocalization scorings ( fig . S1E , F and S2E ) were performed on at least 500 dynamic CCPs ( kymographs ) , from 3 cells imaged during independent experiments . The scorings annotated on each kymograph represent the proportion of CCPs profiles that displayed the phenotype shown in the representative kymographs reported ( to report that the kymographs displayed are truly representative ) . For exemple , in Fig . 1A , 91±5 % ( mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) ) of 319 CCPs ( from 3 cells imaged during independent experiments ) had detectable RFP‐FCHo2 at least 2 timeframes before GFP‐CLC . Apart for fig . S2E where the number of CCPs which had detectable FBP17 was very low ( ~ 3 % ) and only 50 CCPs could be analysed , all the other scorings were done on at least 200 ( up to 400 in some cases ) CCPs analysed randomly , from 3 cells imaged during independent experiments . For experiments ( fig . S10D ) involving the addition of tert‐butanol or 1‐butanol to culture media ( S13 ) , a 4 % alcohol stock buffer ( in DMEM ) was added in equal volume directly into the cell culture dish to give a final concentration of 2 % tert‐ or 1‐butanol . Washout was performed by decanting the total media in the culture dish and quickly replacing with fresh media . Cells were imaged continually throughout the process . Rat hippocampal neuron cultures and synaptic­vesicle endocytosis ( SypHy ) . E18 day old pups were harvested from Sprague‐Dawley rats in accordance with UK Animal policy . The hippocampus was excised and placed into ice‐cold EBSS buffer ( Gibco ) supplemented with 10mM HEPES and Penicillin / Strep mix . Hippocampi were placed into warm buffer with added papain protease ( 10U / mL ) , mechanically homogenized into 2mLs of culture medium , and decanted onto 16mm MatTek glass‐coverslip dishes coated with poly‐D‐lysine ( 50µg / mL ) and laminin ( 20µg / mL ) . Cultures were typically analysed at 4 DIV ( days in vitro ) . Cultured neurons were transfected via electroporation in an Amaxa Nucleofector machine according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Alternatively , cultured neurons were transfected with lipofectmine 2000 at 7 DIV and analysed at 15 DIV according to ( S7 ) . SypHy experiments were performed in a pH 7 . 4 extracellular medium containing 10mM glucose , 136mM NaCl , 2 . 5mM KCl , 10mM HEPES , 1 . 3mM MgCl 2 , 2mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 01mM CNQX and 0 . 05mM DL‐APV , according to ( S7 ) . Neurons were imaged at 1Hz using spinning‐disk confocal microscopy system described above . Neurons depolarization was achieved by application of extracellular medium containing 50mM KCl for 30 sec , followed by a washout into the pH 7 . 4 extracellular medium . Quenching ( pH5 . 5 medium ) was perform at the end of recording to confirm the SypHy signal was at the at the neurons surface . Immunostaining and ligand uptakes ( transferrin , EGF and LDL ) . For immunofluorescence staining ( fig . S1C ) , cells were grown on glass coverslips , fixed with 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde and 6 permeabilized with either 0 . 1 % saponin or 0 . 1 % Triton X‐100 for 1 hour room temperature in 10 % goat serum . Primary and secondary antibodies were delivered in 1 % goat serum , and cells were washed in PBS before being mounted with DABCO anti‐fade agent on glass slides . For surface staining of synaptotagmin1 ( Syt1 , fig . S4D ) , neurons were incubated at 4°C for 1h with the V216 antibody ( rabbit ) in 10 % goat serum in PBS without prior permeabilization of the neurons . After wash of the unbound antibody , the neurons were fixed with 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde , and the antibody revealed with anti‐rabbit‐conjugated secondary antibody . To measure transferrin , EGF and LDL uptake , cells grown on coverslips were incubated with either 10µg / mL Alexa546‐transferrin , 50µg / mL anti‐EGFR monoclonal antibody ( 13A9 ) together with 2ng / mL unlabelled‐EGF ( a concentration of EGF ligand that activate principally clathrin‐mediated endocytosis ( S14 ) ) or 1µg / mL Dil‐LDL for 5minutes at 37°C . Cells were washed with ice‐cold PBS to halt uptake and remove unbound ligands . Cells were then briefly acid washed ( 3 washed , 2 min with pH 5 . 5 buffer , at 4°C ) to remove surface‐bound ligands , fixed in 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde and mounted on slides . Imaging of fixed‐samples ( endogenous staining and transferrin , EGF and LDL uptake ) was performed with the same confocal imaging system described above . Three‐dimensional ( 3D ) stacks were acquired with a piezo‐driven stage using 0 . 3 µ m steps . All the Tf , EGF and LDL signals contained within the boundaries ( PM ) of each cells ( measured on 3D stacks of images ) were quantified and background‐corrected . The values were normalized to the mean ( average ) of the control set to 100 . The quantification represents the mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) of at least 50 cells in each category , from 3 independent experiments . Statistical significances ( p values ) were calculated by unpaired two‐ tailed Student ' s t ‐test . p values inferior to 0 . 01 were considered significant . Liposome co­sedimentation and in vitro tubulation assays . ( Fig . 3B and C , fig . S10B , C and S11C ) . For protein‐membrane binding experiments , liposomes were made by pore extrusion . Liposomes were composed of 80 % Folch brain derived lipids ( Avanti Polar Lipids , item 131101P ) 15 % phosphatidylserine ( PS ) , and 5 % Pi ( 4 , 5 ) P2 . Lipid components were mixed in 1 : 1 chloroform : methanol , dried in glass tubes by Argon gas , rehydrated into buffer ( 150mM NaCl , 20mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , and 2 . 5mM DTT ) , sonicated at 37°C , and filtered through Whatman 0 . 8µm diameter polycarbonate filters to a final concentration of 1mg / ml . For lipid co‐ sedimentation assays , 15 µ M protein was incubated with 0 . 5mg / ml liposomes for 30 minutes at room temperature , and then spun down in a benchtop ultracentrifuge ( Optima TL Ultracentrifuge ) for 10 minutes at 70 , 000rpm ( rotor TLA100 ) . The supernatant was separated from the pellet , both were resuspended in sample buffer , and samples were boiled and run on SDS‐PAGE gels . For in vitro tubulation assays , protein was incubated with 0 . 5mg / ml liposomes in 1 . 5ml eppendorf tubes at room temperature for 15‐30 minutes and pipetted onto glow discharged carbon‐coated copper TEM grids ( Agar brand ) for ~ 1 min . Grids were negative stained with 2 % uranyl acetate for 60 seconds , washed in water briefly , and dried by blotting . Samples were examined on a PW6010 / 20 EM2055 transmission electron microscope ( Phillips ) . 7 Supporting text , technical considerations : Overexpression of fluorescently­tagged versions of FCHo1 / 2 proteins . We observed that , even at low expression levels , C‐terminally tagged versions of FCHo1 / 2 ( e . g . FCHo2‐EGFP ) had a severe dominant‐negative effect on CCPs dynamics ( which were very slow ) and Tf uptake ( impaired ) ( not shown ) . This was consistent with the reported inhibition of Tf and LDL uptake in cells overexpressing FCHo1‐EGFP ( S15 ) and slowed dynamics of CCPs reported under SGIP1 α ‐GFP ( S16 ) . This effect is likely due to a compromised effectiveness of the µ HD – however this is speculation , as we did not test the effectiveness of this fusion protein to bind to eps15 or intersectin . In this study , we used N‐terminally tagged versions of FCHo1 / 2 and SGIP1 ( e . g . EGFP‐ FCHo2 ) since they did not perturb CCP dynamics and Tf uptake , as long as they were used at very low levels of overexpression and observed after a short time of overexpression ( 12 to 20 hours ) . We typically transfected 0 . 1‐0 . 2 µ g of DNA ( without scaling down the lipofectant ) per 10 cm 2 dishes containing ~ 2x10 5 cells . This led to ~ 15‐30 % cells displaying very low levels of overexpression . The movies generated with N‐terminally tagged versions of FCHo1 / 2 and SGIP1 were individually assessed for their CCP dynamics before being further used . These criteria were considered to be legitimate since overexpression of untagged versions of FCHo1 and FCHo2 ‐ even with 2 µ g of plasmid per 10 cm 2 dishes containing ~ 2x10 5 cells – dramatically increased the number of CCPs and Tf uptake ( see Fig . 1F‐H and S5 ) . RNAi depletion . For RNAi experiments we confirmed knockdown of the said protein by immunoblotting on the complete cell population treated with RNAi ( Fig . S8A , B , C , and G ) . This analysis underestimates the efficiency of knockdown in an individual cell as there is generally a low transfection efficiency ( ~ 20 % ) as judged by the expression of RFP‐tagged respective protein . To correct for this ( Fig . S8D ) we have quantified the protein expression levels compared with controls ( no RNAi ) and normalized these for the numbers of cells ( using actin as an internal control in each sample ) . Then we corrected for the 20 % transfection efficiency thus giving a more accurate view of how much the said protein was depleted in the cells imaged by live‐cell imaging . FCHo proteins and synaptic vesicle recycling . FCHo proteins nucleate clathrin in 4 DIV ( days in vitro ) hippocampal neurons and are required for normal synaptic vesicle markers recycling . Given the expression of FCHo1 / 2 in the brain , we depleted FCHo proteins in 4 DIV cultured hippocampal neurons and found that clathrin puncta on neurites were decreased ( fig . S4B‐C ) . Inhibition of clathrin‐mediated endocytosis induces surface accumulation of synaptic vesicle markers , like synaptotagmin‐1 , which fail to recycle following exocytosis ( S17 ) . Upon FCHo1 + 2 RNAi , we observed a concomitant accumulation of the endogenous synaptotagmin‐1 on the plasma membrane as detected by a monoclonal antibody against a luminal epitope of synaptotagmin that will be exposed on vesicle collapse ( fig . S4D ) . To follow the kinetics of synaptic vesicle marker endocytosis , we used the SypHy reporter ( pH‐sensitive pHluorin fused to an intracellular loop of the synaptic vesicle protein , synaptophysin ) , which has been shown to be internalized by clathrin‐mediated endocytosis ( S7 ) . After depolarization , increased SypHy 8 signals ( the result of synaptic vesicles exocytosis ) progressively decreased back to resting levels in control cells but remained elevated for longer in FCHo1 + 2 RNAi treated neurons , as a consequence of a reduction in endocytosis ( fig . S4E ) . We concluded that FCHo1 / 2 proteins are nucleators of clathrin‐mediated endocytosis in 4 DIV hippocampal neurons and are required for normal synaptic vesicle markers recycling . F­BAR­x lipid specificity and twisted tubules . The FCHo2 F‐BAR‐x module bound preferentially to Pi ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ‐containing liposomes . As with all BAR‐membrane interactions the interaction was concentration dependent , but we also note that the preference for Pi ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 was not as evident at high protein concentrations ( 20 µ M + ) , where binding to Pi ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ‐ liposomes but not Pi ( 3 ) P‐liposomes could now be observed . Where we see significant membrane binding then we can also detect tubulation , suggesting that significant binding naturally leads to membrane deformation . It is evident in Fig . 3C that the narrow 18nm tubules are twisted . It is likely that the protein induces this twisting as the membrane interaction sites are not precisely along the concave face of the F‐BAR structure . On the extremities of the structure the membrane binding regions are positioned more towards the sides , and as the F‐ BAR module is symmetrical this results in the membrane twisting around the dimer module ( unpublished observations ) . Supporting discussion : Altogether , this study places FCHo1 / 2 as part of a lipid‐binding module that , by recruiting eps15 and intersectin , functions as a nucleator of clathrin vesicle budding . This study elucidates the centrality of membrane sculpting in the initiation of clathrin‐mediated endocytosis and leads to a model ( fig . S12 ) whereby AP2 is not the initiator of vesicle formation but is mainly an adaptor for clathrin , cargos and accessory proteins . The F‐BAR domain found in FCHo2 can support a number of different curvatures from relatively flat to more extreme curvatures . Vesicle formation requires the generation of progressively higher curvatures . Given that this transition is observed for FCHo2 in vitro as increased protein concentrations leads to more extreme curvatures , we would propose that the narrow curvatures are likely facilitating vesicle neck formation and potentially provide a template for dynamin recruitment . Indeed we see FCHo2 at the rim of constricted CCP profiles by IEM ( Fig . 2E ) . This notion is consistent with the recruitment of dynamin at CCPs toward the time when FCHo2 has passed its maximal signal ( Fig . 1A and fig . S6D ) and also the concomitance between the curvature produced by FCHo2 ( below 20 nm diameter ) and the diameter found to be optimal for dynamin spontaneous recruitment ( S18 ) . We also found that FCHo2 was not present in mature CCVs and we observed that the protein intensity frequently decreased before CCV budding , and if the protein intensity remained then there were multiple rounds of clathrin cycling . It is interesting that FCHo1 / 2 proteins did not bind directly to either AP2 or clathrin and thus this may ensure some time‐lag between the initiation of curvature and vesicle maturation . All these observations are consistent with FCHo1 / 2 initiating curvature while being excluded from the final vesicle . FCHo2 binds to Pi ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and thus provides some specificity for plasma membrane vesicle budding . Given the abundance of polylysine motifs in the F‐BAR‐x it could potentially help to 9 concentrate Pi ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , a key binding substrate for AP2 , epsin , AP180 / CALM , all components involved in CCP maturation ( S9 , S10 , S19 ) . FCHo1 / 2 proteins also have a µ HD that can be found in a number of other proteins and has recently been crystallized from the yeast Syp1p ( S15 ) . We show that binding of eps15 and intersectin to this domain is necessary for maturation of the coated‐pit . This is likely because these proteins provide the link to AP2 ( as each has an AP2 interaction region ) and also eps15 is ( at least ) a dimer and may help crosslink the FCHo2 proteins , helping to concentrate them . Consistent with this , we observe that FCHo2 ( while plasma membrane localized ) is not clustered in the absence of eps15 / eps15R and intersectins . It is notable that yeast Syp1p interacts with the yeast homologue of eps15 ( Ede1 ) ( S15 ) . It points to a primordial origin for the clathrin pathway where sculpting and crosslinking proteins , rather than clathrin and its adaptors , may be the commonality between yeast and metazoans . It is notable that the F‐BAR‐x ( membrane binding / sculpting ) and µ HD ( eps15 / intersectin recruiting ) domains function synergistically in FCHo1 / 2 to nucleate CCPs . Indeed , SGIP1 which contains a µ HD that binds eps15 ( S20 ) but lacks the F‐BAR‐x did not rescue CCP formation in the absence of FCHo1 / 2 ( Fig 3A ) . Consistently , SGIP1 is not recruited early to CCPs ( fig . S10A ) . FCHo1 / 2 proteins are conserved across species and are ubiquitous in mammals and are thus likely to play a fundamental role in most CCV budding events from the plasma membrane , including synaptic vesicle endocytosis . These observations put curvature generation as fundamental to clathrin‐coated pit formation and vesicle budding and place FCHo1 / 2 as the key initial element for nutrient uptake , receptor regulation and synaptic vesicle retrieval . Supplementary figures fig . S1 Preliminary to Fig . 1 ( A ) Domain organization of human FCHo1 and mouse FCHo2 ( the clones used in this study ) . The proteins have a similar organization and contain N - terminal F - BAR domains ( residues 1 to 262 in FCHo2 ) , immediately followed by an extended ( x ) domain ( residues 263 - 430 ) found in the yeast homolog Syp1p and in SGIP1 ( S16 ) and which enhances lipid membrane binding ( see fig . S10B ) . The region following the extended domain but prior to the µ HD is predicted to be unstructured and shows very low sequence homology between FCHo proteins . In the yeast homolog Syp1p , this region has been shown to inhibit Las17 / WASp - dependent actin assembly ( S21 ) . Both FCHo1 and FCHo2 end with C - terminal µ HDs ( a domain with homology with µ 2 - subunit of AP2 ( see fig . S9A and ( S15 ) ) that are also found in stonin 1 and 2 , δ COP , SGIP1 and the yeast homolog Syp1p ( S15 , S22 ) . Bottom - FCHo2 F - BAR domains homodimerize . Syp1p µ HD ( S15 ) are shown at scale . ( B ) FCHo1 / 2 is expressed ubiquitously . The expression level of FCHo1 / 2 directly correlates with that of clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) .

This inhibition was relieved by the co - expression of an RNAi - resistant form of RFP - FCHo2 ( rescue ) .

The quantifications measured the nucleation rate ( number of new clathrin - coated pits / 10 4 µm 2 / second ) ( top ) and Tf uptake ( bottom ) in BSC1 cells transfected with 0 , 1 or 2 µg of FCHo1 for 2x10 5 cells . Note that the transferring ( Tf ) uptake increased with more nucleation – but its extent is likely limited by receptor recycling . ( B ) Overexpression ( 0 , 1 or 2µg ) of myc - Epsin1 induces an increase of σ 2 - EGFP ( AP2 ) density at 2µg , which , in contrast to FCHo1 / 2 , is due to an slowdown of CCP dynamics ( see arrows ) and results in an inhibition of Tf uptake .

The area highlighted in red corresponds to the pull down shown in Figure 2A . The tables show a more complete list of protein interactions and the peptide coverage from GST - FCHo2 µHD pull downs out of rat brain and HeLa cell lysates . The presence of dynamin is potentially indirect as it binds intersectin with high affinity ( S24 ) . ( B ) Western blots of the GST - FCHo2 µHD pull down lysates . Total cell lysate ( RBL ) , RBL + GST , and GST - µHD + RBL were blotted for intersectin1 , eps15 , dynamin , and AP2 - α adaptin subunit . Intersectin and Eps15 displayed enrichment in GST - µHD pull downs , whereas dynamin was de - enriched and AP2 - α was absent .

No tubulation was observed by either F - BAR or F - BAR - x protein on Folch + PS liposomes . Moderate tubulation was seen by F - BAR protein on FolchPS + Pi ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 liposomes , and tubules were broad in diameter ( 70 - 130nm ) . The F - BAR - x module produced a higher degree of membrane tubulation of FolchPS + Pi ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 liposomes . Scale bars , 200 nm ( D ) The acute decrease of cellular Pi ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 by the addition of 2 % of the primary alcohol 1 - butanol ( S13 ) induced reversible loss of FCHo2 plasma membrane localization . EGFP - FCHo2 ( FCHo2 ) and RFP - LCa ( clathrin ) , which colocalize in the cell before treatment , became cytosolic within 1 minute following the addition of 2 % 1 - butanol , as observed by live - cell imaging . Following washout of 1 - butanol , FCHo2 and clathrin rapidly relocalized to the plasma membrane . During 1 - butanol washout , nucleation rate were transiently higher , as reported earlier ( S13 ) . As expected , 2 % of the tertiary alcohol t - butanol had no effect ( bottom panel ) . Scale bar , 5 µm . ( E ) A model indicating how the F - BAR dimer can support both moderate and extreme positive membrane curvature . When the F - BAR dimer orients perpendicular to the long axis of a membrane tubule , only moderate curvature is generated since the F - BAR dimer is only shallowly curved . If the F - BAR dimers are shifted to an oblique angle , however , high curvature is generated ( see Supplementary Movie S2 ) . This may explain how FCHo2 can localize to relatively flat regions of the plasma membrane , accumulate , and create the initial dimple of the nascent CCP .

I268N lies on the beginning of the extended domain and faces inward into the conserved hydrophobic pocket along the F - BAR ‘wing’ .

The F - BAR domain alone generated few plasma membrane tubules in HeLa cells when over - expressed , but expressing of F - BAR - x lead to membrane tubulation ( see inset ) . Mutants attenuate membrane tubulation and lead to a diffuse plasma membrane signal ( see insets ) . Scale bar , 20 µm ( E ) FCHo1 / 2 - depleted BSC1 cells expressing RNAi - resistant mutants FCHo2 FL ( see chart Fig . 3D ) . Western blots against FCHo2 demonstrate ~ 80 % knockdown of endogenous FCHo2 . E D C fig . S12 A model for FCHo1 / 2 proteins as nucleators of CCP formation . FCHo proteins bind to the plasma membrane at sites where CCPs will form . They recruit the early CCP proteins eps15 and intersectin , which function to cluster FCHo proteins into puncta and generate the initial curvature . As FCHo protetins and Eps15 ( S27 ) accumulate at the rim of nascent CCP , more extreme curvatures are generated by FCHo proteins as they accumulate and change their angle on the membrane . Eps15 and intersectin recruit AP2 , which can subsequently engage clathrin and additional accessory factors necessary for maturation of vesicle formation and budding . 10 Supplementary movies and legends : Supplementary Movie S1 : BSC1 σ 2‐EGFP cells imaged for 150 frames at 2s interval using a spinning‐disk confocal . Control ( left panel ) or transfected ( 2 µ g of untagged FCHo2 plasmid , right panel ) . The movie was accelerated 10 times . Please note the increased density of CCP with FCHo2 overexpression . Supplementary Movie S2 : Simulation of membrane bending by multiple F‐BAR dimer modules . The FCHo2 F‐BAR module was based on the crystal structure ( pdb : 2V0o ) . The F‐ BARs are initially recruited to flat membrane , and as they accumulate , they generate membrane curvature and shift to support a more extreme membrane curvature by reorienting at an oblique angle relative to the tubule axis .
