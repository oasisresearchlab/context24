MBC in Press , published on October 17 , 2003 as 10 . 1091 / mbc . E03 - 06 - 0419 2 Abstract We have purified two new complexes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae , one containing the centromere component Mtw1p together with Nnf1p , Nsl1p , and Dsn1p , which we call the Mtw1p complex , and the other containing Spc105p and Ydr532p , which we call the Spc105p complex . Further purifications using Dsn1p tagged with protein A show , in addition to the other components of the Mtw1p complex , the two components of the Spc105p complex and the four components of the previously described Ndc80p complex , suggesting that all three complexes are closely associated . Fluorescence microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy show that Nnf1p , Nsl1p , Dsn1p , Spc105p , and Ydr532p all localize to the nuclear side of the spindle pole body and along short spindles . Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that all five proteins are associated with centromere DNA . Homologues of Nsl1p and Spc105p in Schizosaccharomyces pombe also localize to the centromere . Temperature - sensitive mutations of Nsl1p , Dsn1p , and Spc105p all cause defects in chromosome segregation . Synthetic - lethal interactions are found between temperature - sensitive mutations in proteins from all three complexes , in agreement with their close physical association . These results show an increasingly complex structure for the S . cerevisiae centromere and a probable conservation of structure between parts of the centromeres of S . cerevisiae and S . pombe .

The microtubules of the mitotic spindle are connected to the chromosomes by the kinetochore , a substructure within the centromere of the chromosome ( Pollard and Earnshaw , 2002 ) . The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a relatively simple centromere and kinetochore , and these are likely to be the first characterized in molecular terms , given the large number of components already identified . There is also increasing evidence of conservation at the protein level between yeast and vertebrate centromeres and kinetochores ( Kitagawa and Hieter , 2001 ; Cheeseman et al . , 2002a ; Biggins and Walczak , 2003 ; Cleveland et al . , 2003 ) . This is despite the large difference in size between the 125 - bp centromere DNA of S . cerevisiae , and the centromere DNAs of other species , which are > 25 kb in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and several Mb in vertebrate cells ( Sullivan et al . , 2001 ) . There are also large differences in kinetochore size among these organisms , reflecting the differences in centromere DNA size . Thus , S . cerevisiae probably has one microtubule per kinetochore ( Peterson and Ris , 1976 ; O ' Toole et al . , 1999 ) , S . pombe three ( Ding et al . , 1993 ) , and vertebrate cells about 25 ( McDonald et al . , 1992 ) . The conservation at the protein level suggests that , despite the difference in size , the study of the simple S . cerevisiae centromere and kinetochore can contribute to a molecular understanding of the more complex mammalian structures . A combination of biochemical , genetic , and one - and two - hybrid approaches have identified many components of the S . cerevisiae centromere / kinetochore ( Kitagawa and Hieter , 2001 ; Cheeseman et al . , 2002b ; Biggins and Walczak , 2003 ) . The approximate positions of some of these components , in terms of their relationships to centromere DNA or the microtubule , are already becoming clear ( see Figure 10 below ) . Components such as the CBF3 complex ( Lechner and Carbon , 1991 ) , Cbf1p ( Cai and Davis , 1989 ; Jiang and Philippsen , 1989 ) , and Cse4p ( Meluh et al . , 1998 ) , which bind centromere DNA 5 directly , are presumably close to the DNA . Components such as Stu2p ( Wang and Huffaker , 1997 ; He et al . , 2001 ) , Slk19p ( Zeng et al . , 1999 ) , Bik1p ( He et al . , 2001 ; Lin et al . , 2001 ) , and the Dam1p / DDD / DASH complex ( Cheeseman et al . , 2001a , 2002a ; Janke et al . , 2002 ; Li et al . , 2002 ) , which are clearly associated with microtubules and are also associated with centromere DNA , as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assays , are probably components of , or closely associated , with the kinetochore . The locations of the other yeast centromere / kinetochore components in relation to the microtubule ends , where the kinetochores presumably reside , have yet to be established . Thus , we will refer to these other yeast centromere / kinetochore components simply as centromere components . Our approach to identifying yeast centromere components has been a mass spectrometric analysis of highly enriched spindle poles ( Wigge et al . , 1998 ) . These contain the yeast equivalent of the centrosome , the spindle pole body ( SPB ) , together with attached spindle microtubules ( Rout and Kilmartin , 1990 ) . This spindle pole preparation also contains centromere and kinetochore components because fungi are unusual in having these structures clustered around the SPB through most of the cell cycle , apart from mitosis ( Heath , 1980 ; Funabiki et al . , 1993 ; Jin et al . , 2000 ) . However , this preparation contains only a subset of centromere components ( Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ) , probably because of the DNase I treatment used during the enrichment , which may remove components that are closer to the centromere DNA . A powerful way of identifying the relationships between some of these components is to tag one component with protein A , then purify the tagged protein together with any associated proteins on an IgG column ( Grandi et al . , 1993 ; Knop and Schiebel , 1997 ) . Using this approach , the centromere component Ndc80p ( Rout and Kilmartin , 1990 ; Wigge et al . , 1998 ) was found to be associated with Nuf2p , Spc25p , and Spc24p ( Janke et al . , 2001 ; Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ) , all three of which had been identified previously in the spindle pole preparation ( Wigge et al . , 1998 ) . The centromere protein Mtw1p ( Goshima and Yanagida , 2000 ) and also Spc105p , whose localization suggests it might be a centromere component , have also been identified as 6 components of this preparation ( Wigge et al . , 1998 ; Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ) . Therefore , we decided to use protein A tagging to identify potential interacting partners of Mtw1p and Spc105p . Materials and Methods Yeast Strains , Plasmids , and Growth Conditions All S . cerevisiae strains ( Table 1 ) were prepared using standard genetic methods in the K699 background or the isogenic diploid K842 ( Nasmyth et al . , 1990 ) , and the yeast vectors used ( Table 2 ) were the pRS series ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) . Standard growth conditions were used for both S . cerevisiae ( Sherman , 1991 ) and S . pombe ( Moreno et al . , 1991 ) . Strains with C - terminal protein A or GFP tags were prepared as before ( Wigge et al . , 1998 ) , by recombinant PCR using pJK474 and pJK472 as templates , but with Vent polymerase ( New England BioLabs ) . A strain containing C - terminal HA - tagged Spc105p ( VNY290 ) marked with Kluyveromyces lactis TRP1 was prepared by recombinant PCR using pVN7 . 10 1 - 1 as template . Strains containing SPBs labeled with Spc42p - CFP were prepared by integration of pJK578 at the TRP1 locus as a single copy . pJK578 was prepared from SPC42 - GFP ( Adams and Kilmartin , 1999 ) by replacement of the GFP with CFP by exchanging a Msc I - Mun I fragment from the CFP plasmid pDH3 ( Hailey et al . , 2002 ) . All tagged strains had the same growth rate as wild type . Yeast genes were cloned by PCR using Vent polymerase or , for larger genes , by gap repair ( Orr - Weaver et al . , 1983 ) . Deletions were complete removals of the open reading frame by recombinant PCR . Temperature - sensitive ( Ts - when describing the phenotype , ts when describing the genotype ) mutants were prepared by modifications of error - prone PCR and the gapping procedure ( Muhlrad et al . , 1992 ; Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ) . The procedure evolved during the course of this work . The initial Ts - mutants ( mtw1 , nsl1 , and nnf1 ) were prepared by replacement of the disrupted locus with the PCR - amplified ts plasmids 7 ( Tyers et al . , 1993 ) . All the other mutants were prepared by slight modifications of the popin - popout procedure ( Rothstein , 1991 ) described below . Restriction sites for the gapping were chosen close to the ends of the open reading frames , and oligonucleotide primers for the error - prone PCR ( 7 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM dATP and dGTP , 1 mM dCTP and dTTP ) were 100 - 150 bp before and after these sites . After transformation , the cells were frozen at – 70 ˚ C after addition of 10 % DMSO , and aliquots were plated to give 1000 - 3000 colonies for each 13 cm diameter selective plate at 23 ˚ C . When transformants were just visible , they were replica plated onto fluoroorotic acid medium ( Boeke et al . , 1987 ) at 23 ˚ C , then further replica plated onto warm ( 37 ˚ C ) and then ambient ( 23 ˚ C ) YEPD plates . Ts - colonies were rechecked by patching on YEPD at 37 ˚ C and 23 ˚ C . The selected strains formed colonies < 40 µm in diameter after 2 days at 37 ˚ C and had low reversion frequencies ; growth at 23 ˚ C appeared normal , and colonies were of a uniform size . Yeast DNA was then prepared and electroporated into E . coli . Plasmids were sequenced to identify amino acid changes , and the mutant genes were transferred to pRS306 using the gapping sites to eliminate any changes in the noncoding region . The resulting plasmids , with a single restriction enzyme cut in the coding region , were then transformed into strain K699 for the popin - popout procedure . After restreaking , 16 transformants were patched onto fluoroorotic acid plates , then replica plated onto warm and ambient YEPD plates . Ts - colonies and the parental Ura + colonies were checked by PCR to verify the popin and popout events , and they were further checked for rescue by the low - copy plasmid carrying the wild - type gene and by backcrossing to show that a single ts mutation was present . The changes found for mtw1 - 11 ( JK1504 ) were E33G , K67E , N74T , V76E , and L144Q ; for nnf1 - 77 ( VNY87 ) , R11Q , L57S , M73K , Y124L , and E151G ; for nsl1 - 5 ( VNY72 ) , L35P , Q88R , M106T , V131I , I147N , Q158L , and N174I ; for nsl1 - 6 ( VNY69 ) , W110R , K136R , and Y182C ; for dsn1 - 7 ( VNY96 ) , K73R , K416R , N437I , and V451E ; for dsn1 - 8 ( VNY99 ) , Q515P , and T541P ; for spc105 - 4 ( VNY162 ) , D55N , V243A , N245D , M376K , Y503H , D553V , N616S , E631G , Y644N , M662T , S680P , L759P , and V856D ; for spc105 - 15 ( VNY164 ) , N2Y , S269P , S348P , D363G , I523N , L683S , L736P , D752G , M781V , and K810R ( plus the change A - 3G in the 5´ non - 8 coding region just before the presumed initiator ATG codon ) ; for dam1 - 31 ( MSY72 ) , G104C , K194Q , K199E and G237S ; for dad1 - 13 ( MSY90 ) , T5S , N7K , and L69R ; for duo1 - 61 ( MSY79 ) N32S , C100R , K169E , D178V , and R214G ; and for ask1 - 22 ( MSY87 ) , V14D , L60R , L69M , S155A , E176V , and R197S . The phenotypes of the pairs of nsl1 , dsn1 , and spc105 alleles were very similar in each case ( our unpublished results ) . In addition the phenotypes of the mtw1 - 11 , nnf1 - 77 , dam1 - 31 , dad1 - 13 , duo1 - 61 , and ask1 - 22 alleles used here were very similar in each case ( our unpublished results ) to the previously described alleles ( Shan et al . , 1997 ; Goshima and Yanagida , 2000 ; Cheeseman et al . , 2001a ; Enquist - Newman et al . , 2001 ; Euskirchen , 2002 ; Li et al . , 2002 ) . S . pombe strains were constructed by recombinant PCR ( Bähler et al . , 1998 ) , using pJK544 as template with Vent polymerase and transformation of the PCR products into strain IH365 . Transformants were checked as before ( Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ) , except that the 3´ genomic sequence corresponding to the primer used was not checked because the predicted adjacent 3´ open reading frames are several hundred base pairs away . Transformants were backcrossed into JK1527 , which has HA - tagged bub1 + ( Bernard et al . , 1998 ) . Isolation of Complexes and Mass Spectrometry Complexes were isolated as before ( Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ) . Samples were run in different gels or some distance apart to minimize cross contamination . Proteins in SDS gel bands were identified by MALDI mass spectrometry as before ( Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ) , except that the entire NCBI database ( > 1 . 3 x 10 6 protein sequences ) was searched using Mascot ( http : / / www . matrixscience . com ) , at between 40 - 100 ppm , allowing for methionine oxidation and up to one missed tryptic cleavage . All identifications reported were the top match found . The MALDI method did not give a clear identification for some proteins , in particular Nnf1p in Figure 1 , D - G ; Ydr532p in Figure 1 , E and G ; and Nuf2p in Figure 1I . Liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry / mass spectrometry ( LC - MS / MS ) was used instead to identify these proteins 9 ( Aebersold and Mann , 2003 ) . In LC - MS / MS , the peptides from the digested gel band are separated by HPLC , and the column output is sprayed directly into the QSTAR mass spectrometer ( Applied Biosystems / MDS Sciex API QSTAR Pulsar i ) . The mass spectrometer detects the peptides and selects those for fragmentation and sequencing , based on their intensity and charge state . Thus , in the quite intense Coomassie - stained band ( above band e ) in Figure 1D , MALDI mass spectrometry only identified protein A and failed to identify the expected Nnf1p . In contrast , LC - MS / MS was able to identify and sequence seven Nnf1p peptides ( 33 % sequence coverage ) in this band . In the other gels , LC - MS / MS sequenced 5 - 6 Nnf1p peptides ( 25 - 33 % coverage ; Figure 1 , E - G ) , 6 - 7 peptides for Ydr532p ( 18 - 23 % coverage ; Figure 1 , E and G ) , and 11 peptides for Nuf2p ( 31 % coverage ; Figure 1I ) . Cytology Observations of GFP or CFP fluorescence in live S . cerevisiae cells were carried out as described elsewhere ( He et al . , 2000 ; Tanaka et al . , 2000 ; Hailey et al . , 2002 ) . ImmunoEM was as described previously ( Adams and Kilmartin , 1999 ) using anti - GFP raised in a rabbit against a native GST - GFP fusion , depleted of GST antibodies , and affinity - purified with the fusion protein ( our unpublished results ) . A strain containing GFP - labeled SPBs was included in the immunoEM to check specificity . Cells for immunofluorescence ( Adams and Pringle , 1984 ; Kilmartin and Adams , 1984 ) were fixed for 25 min for detecting GFP - labeled chromosomes and tubulin ; this period of fixation still allowed detection of GFP with anti - GFP while preserving reasonable microtubule morphology . Fixation for 60 min was used for detection of tubulin , SPBs , and myc - labeled Pds1p . The antibodies used for immunofluorescence were anti - tubulin YOL1 / 34 ( Kilmartin et al . , 1982 ) ; anti - Tub4p for SPBs , which was prepared in a rabbit against a GST fusion of residues 447 - 473 of Tub4p , and absorbed as described for anti - GFP above ( our unpublished results ) ; and anti - myc 9E10 ( Evan et al . , 1985 ) , for myc - tagged Pds1p . In classifying the various microtubule morphologies described in the text , 100 - 150 cells were counted for each time point , unless otherwise stated . 10 S . pombe GFP fluorescence in live cells was analyzed as before ( Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ) except that exposures were 0 . 2 - 0 . 3 sec . A different version of GFP , GFP5 ( Siemering et al . , 1996 ) , was used instead of the S65T GFP used earlier ( Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ) . The intensity of the GFP5 signal appeared to be more susceptible to formaldehyde fixation ; thus , only 3 min of fixation were used for experiments combining immunofluorescence with observations of GFP fluorescence , rather than the 9 min used previously ( Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ) . Antibodies used for immunofluorescence were anti - Sad1 ( Hagan and Yanagida , 1995 ) , anti - tubulin TAT1 ( Woods et al . , 1989 ) , and anti - HA 16B12 ( Covance , Princeton , NJ ) for detecting HA - tagged Bub1 . All images were acquired with a charge - coupled - device camera ( model RTEA / CCD - 1800 - Y , Princeton Instruments , Trenton , NJ ) . Genetic Interactions All of the ts alleles described in this study and four previously described ts alleles of the Ndc80p complex ( ndc80 - 1 , nuf2 - 61 , spc24 - 1 , and spc25 - 1 : Osborne et al . , 1994 ; Wigge et al . , 1998 ; Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ) were crossed with each other . The normal replica plating technique had to be changed for crosses involving the spc105 alleles because of microcolony formation ( see Results ) and reversion . Spore colonies were picked with a toothpick , and most of the adherent cells were wiped off on a YEPD plate . The remaining cells on the toothpick were streaked downwards ( to give a variable density of cells ) in a patch of about 15 mm square and grown for 14 h at 23 ˚ C prior to replica plating . In all the crosses , five tetrads were picked initially to check for any lethality . After that , a total of 20 - 36 tetrads were picked at 23 ° C for each cross showing interactions , and spores were checked the next day in the microscope for germination . Tetrads in which one or two of the spores failed to germinate ( 2 % ) or where mating type did not segregate 2 : 2 ( 0 . 3 % ) were not examined further . We also eliminated a small minority of tetrads ( 4 % ) in which 11 segregation patterns appeared to show growth of the double ts , in contrast to the bulk of the data for that pair of mutations . For two such tetrads , showing one Ts + spore and three Ts – spores ( one of which should have been a double ts and thus inviable ) , we backcrossed each Ts – spore with wild - type and found that each contained one ts mutation , suggesting that gene conversion had occurred or that a false tetrad ( 4 loose spores clumped together ) had been picked . For the remaining tetrads , colony growth was checked at 23 ˚ C , 30 ˚ C , and 37 ˚ C , except that growth at 30 ° C was not checked for pairs of mutations of the Mtw1p and Ndc80p complexes . In all crosses , with the exceptions outlined above , the spore inviability observed could be entirely explained by the predicted presence of the double ts mutants . Other Methods Immunoprecipitations ( Figure 1J ) were from 25 ml of culture harvested at 5 x 10 7 cells / ml and broken open with 0 . 4 - mm glass beads in 0 . 2 ml of lysis buffer ( 7 . 5 % glycerol , 50 mM Tris - Cl pH 7 . 8 , 0 . 1 M NaCl , 5 mM EGTA , 1 mM EDTA and 1 : 50 solution Q ( Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ) ) . Lysates were precleared by centrifugation at 13 , 000 rpm for 10 min , then incubated with 5 µl IgG - Sepharose beads ( Amersham Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) for 4 . 5 h at 4 ˚ C . Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer , boiled with 50 µl SDS sample buffer ; 20 µl were then loaded onto the SDS gel . Immunoblots were stained with 12CA5 anti - HA ( Niman et al . , 1983 ; Field et al . , 1988 ) to detect the HA tag or rabbit IgG to detect protein A , followed by appropiate secondary antibodies . Flow cytometry was carried out as described previously ( Haase and Lew , 1997 ) . Chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assays were carried out by multiplex PCR in an ndc10 - 1 background ( Goh and Kilmartin , 1993 ; Meluh and Koshland , 1997 ; Ortiz et al . , 1999 ) . The regions of chromosome III amplified were 110410 - 110615 , 114322 - 114558 , and 118249 - 118538 . The primers were 23mers except at 114558 where Primer 1 was used ( Meluh and Koshland , 1997 ) ; the Mg + + concentration was 4 mM . 12 Results Identification of Components of the Mtw1p and Spc105p Complexes and Interactions Between Them and the Ndc80p Complex The centromere protein Mtw1p ( Goshima and Yanagida , 2000 ) and Spc105p have both been identified as components of enriched S . cerevisiae spindle pole preparations ( Wigge et al . , 1998 ; Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ) . We wished to identify interacting proteins using protein A ( pA ) - tagging , similar to the way the Ndc80p complex was identified , where four components of the spindle pole preparation were found to be associated in a complex ( Janke et al . , 2001 ; Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ) . When Mtw1p was coupled to protein A and purified , three other proteins co - purified ( Figure 1A ) and were identified by mass spectrometry as Dsn1p , Nnf1p , and Nsl1p . Mtw1p , Dsn1p , and Nsl1p have recently been identified in genetic screens as either dosage suppressors or synthetically lethal with nnf1 - 17 ( Euskirchen , 2002 ) . These genetic interactions are in agreement with our data showing all four proteins in a complex , which we call the Mtw1p complex . Purification of Spc105p coupled to protein A also co - purified Ydr532p , a protein of unknown function ( Figure 1B ) , while reciprocally , purification of Ydr532p - protein A also co - purified Spc105p ( Figure 1C ) . We call this complex the Spc105p complex . The other bands on the gels , which were identified as heat shock proteins or ribosomal elongation factor , are probably contaminants ( see Figure 1 legend ) . We were unable to identify any proteins in the bands at the bottom of the gel in Figure 1 , B and C ( or in the gels below ) ; thus , it is possible that additional components of either of these two complexes may exist . Recently , Mtw1p was found to be associated with another complex , the Ctf19p complex ( Cheeseman et al . , 2002a ) , which contains 12 proteins . However , Dsn1p , Nnf1p , and Nsl1p were not found to be associated with the Ctf19p complex . To confirm the composition of the Mtw1p complex we have found ( Figure 1A ) , and to see whether 13 components of the Ctf19p complex could be isolated in association with Mtw1p , we did reciprocal purifications using Nnf1p , Dsn1p , and Nsl1p tagged with protein A ( Figure 1 , D - F ) . Gel bands were analyzed by a combination of MALDI and LC - MS / MS mass spectrometry ( see Materials and Methods ) . Here , in order to maximize the amounts of protein so as to detect minor components , we used the fraction eluted later from the column , which contained higher amounts of tagged protein , but also a higher proportion of contaminating proteins ( bands a - g , see the Figure 1 legend for identifications ) . The amounts of these contaminating bands were fairly consistent in the different preparations . The isolation of Mtw1p tagged with protein A under these conditions is also included ( Figure 1G ) . The result of the Nnf1p - protein A isolation was consistent with the results shown in Figure 1A ; i . e . , only Dsn1p , Mtw1p , and Nsl1p were found ( Figure 1D ) . A different result was found for the Dsn1p - protein A isolation ( Figure 1E ) . The expected Mtw1p , Nnf1p , and Nsl1p bands were found , but in addition there were extra gel bands , which contained the components of the Spc105p ( Figure 1 , B and C ) and Ndc80p complexes . The composition of all three complexes is summarized in Figure 1K . The Nsl1p - protein A isolation showed the other three Mtw1p complex components , and also showed Spc105p ( Figure 1F ) . The Mtw1p - protein A isolations always showed Dsn1p , Nnf1p , and Nsl1p as in Figure 1A , but some preparations ( Figure 1G ) also showed all of the components of the Spc105p and Ndc80p complexes as well . The reason for this variability was not clear , as Dsn1p - protein A isolations always showed all three complexes . These results suggest that the Mtw1p , Spc105p , and Ndc80p complexes are closely associated . Why are the Spc105p and Ndc80p complexes mainly absent in the Nnf1p - protein A and Nsl1p - protein A isolations ? We think this is probably due to small changes in the binding affinities between the three complexes caused by the protein A tag . These are probably irrelevant inside the cell , since there is no apparent phenotype associated with the tagging , but these differences in affinity may become important during the stringent washing conditions associated with the isolation , so that the Spc105p and Ndc80p 14 complexes can be washed away . It also seems that part of the Dsn1p has a lower affinity for the Mtw1p complex and is partly washed off the column , because it appears to be present in sub - stoichiometric amounts in the Nnf1p - , Nsl1p - , and Mtw1p - protein A isolations ( Figure 1 , D , F , and G ) but not apparently in the Dsn1p - protein A isolation ( Figure 1E ) . These results show that the Spc105p and Ndc80p complexes can be co - purified with the Mtw1p complex . Can the Mtw1p complex be co - purified with the Spc105p and Ndc80p complexes ? Isolation of both the Ndc80p ( Figure 1H ) and Spc105p ( Figure 1I ) complexes to maximize the amounts of protein as above did indeed show the presence of very low amounts of Mtw1p in the Ndc80p complex and Ndc80p , Nuf2p , Mtw1p , and Nsl1p in the Spc105p complex . Again , the presence of these extra proteins in the Spc105p complex was variable , as for the Mtw1p complex above . Although no component of the Spc105p complex was detected by mass spectrometry in the Ndc80p - protein A isolation , Spc105p could be detected in immunoblots of immunoprecipitates of Ndc80p - protein A using less stringent washing ( Figure 1J ) . Taken as a whole , these results identify two new complexes , the Mtw1p and Spc105p complexes , and suggest that there is a close association between these complexes and the Ndc80p complex ( Figure 1K ) . Localization of Nnf1p , Nsl1p , Dsn1p , Spc105p , and Ydr532p Mtw1p and the components of the Ndc80p complex localize to the centromere ( Goshima and Yanagida , 2000 ; Janke et al . , 2001 ; Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ) . This suggests that all of the proteins present in the closely associated Mtw1p and Spc105p complexes should also localize to the centromere . In S . cerevisiae , centromeres are clustered around the nuclear face of the SPB ( Goshima and Yanagida , 2000 ; He et al . , 2000 ; Jin et al . , 2000 ; Tanaka et al . , 2000 ) , and indeed HA - tagged Spc105p appeared to localize to the nuclear side of the SPB , although the signal was weak ( Wigge et al . , 1998 ) . Nnf1p , Nsl1p , and Dsn1p have been localized to the spindle pole region 15 ( Euskirchen , 2002 ) , but it was not established whether this was at the SPB or on the spindle close to the nuclear side of the SPB . Thus , we tagged Nnf1p , Nsl1p , Dsn1p , Spc105p and Ydr532p with GFP to determine their localizations relative to the SPBs both in unfixed cells ( Figure 2 ) and by immunoEM ( Figure 3 ) . All five proteins localized similarly . They were present between the SPBs in short spindles ( Figure 2 and left side of Figure 3 ) , and associated with the nuclear face of the SPB in all other cells ( right side of Figure 3 ) . This staining pattern is very similar to that found for other centromere components in S . cerevisiae , including Ndc80p ( Rout and Kilmartin , 1990 ) , Ndc10p ( Goh and Kilmartin , 1993 ) , Ctf19p ( Hyland et al . , 1999 ) , Mtw1p ( Goshima and Yanagida , 2000 ) , Ctf3p , Mcm16p , and Mcm22p ( Measday et al . , 2002 ) , and Chl4p and Iml3p / Mcm19p ( Pot et al . , 2003 ) . Chromatin Immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) Assay The association of Nnf1p , Nsl1p , Dsn1p , Spc105p , and Ydr532p with the centromere protein Mtw1p and the centromere Ndc80p complex , together with the localization patterns of these proteins , suggest that they are all associated with the centromere . We confirmed this by using the ChIP assay ( Meluh and Koshland , 1997 ) . In this assay , PCR is used to detect centromere DNA associated with a tagged protein after formaldehyde cross - linking and sonication to shear the chromosomes and solubilize cross - linked proteins . Additional primers in the same PCR reaction amplify non - centromeric flanking sequences and provide a negative control . Except for the wild - type K699 , the strains used carried the ndc10 - 1 mutation ( Goh and Kilmartin , 1993 ) , since the disassembly of the centromere in such a strain at 36 ˚ C ( Ortiz et al . , 1999 ) is a useful negative control . Nnf1p , Nsl1p , Dsn1p , Spc105p , and Ydr532p all show Ndc10p - dependent association with centromere DNA ( Figure 4 ) , indicating that the five proteins are indeed associated with the centromere . 16 Localization of S . pombe Homologues of Nsl1p and Spc105p Because of the relatively large number of 16 chromosomes in S . cerevisiae , the localization pattern of genuine centromere components is not distinguishable from that of microtubule - associated proteins that mainly bind along shorter nuclear microtubules , which are also clustered around the SPB ( O ' Toole et al . , 1999 ) . Moreover , it has not yet been possible to resolve the 16 individual centromeres or kinetochores in S . cerevisiae except in pachytene spreads ( Hayashi et al . , 1998 ; Klein et al . , 1999 ; Zeng et al . , 1999 ) , where the kinetochores are probably only partly assembled since they lack microtubules ( Goetsch and Byers , 1982 ) . In S . pombe , with just three chromosomes , centromere cytology is much clearer , and previously we used this organism to localize homologues of the Ndc80p complex ( Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ) . Also , comparisons of kinetochores and centromeres of S . cerevisiae and S . pombe are particularly interesting because the two organisms are evolutionarily divergent and there are big differences in centromere DNA content . Homologues of both Nsl1p and Spc105p are present in both Candida albicans ( http : / / genolist . pasteur . fr / CandidaDB / , gene names IPF5166 and SPC105 ) and S . pombe . Blast searches using the S . cerevisiae proteins gave E values of 4 x 10 - 6 and 3 x 10 - 14 for the S . pombe homologues of Nsl1p ( SPAC688 . 02c , here named SpNsl1 ) and Spc105p ( SPCC1020 . 02 / SPC7 , here named SpSpc105 ) , respectively . An alignment of the three yeast Nsl1p sequences and a comparison of the Spc105p homologues in S . cerevisiae , C . albicans , and S . pombe is shown in Figure 5 , A and B . The three Spc105p homologues showed some interesting features . In particular , each has a short region of coiled coil near the C - terminus preceded by the sequence WYD / EWR . In addition , close to the N - terminus , the sequence RRVSFA is followed by repeats of the sequence ME / DLT . At present it is not clear what the functions of these conserved sequences are , but they may be a reliable signature for this protein family . There is also an S . pombe homologue of Nnf1p ( SPAC30 . 08 ) , but we were unable to tag this with GFP . 17 Live S . pombe cells containing GFP - tagged SpNsl1 or SpSpc105 gave similar localization patterns : in mitosis there were up to six separate spots ( Figure 5 , C1 and D1 ) , which later coalesced into two separated spots , presumably during anaphase B ( Figure 5 , C2 and D2 ) . This pattern suggests localization to the centromeres . Cells not in mitosis showed a single spot , which in fixed cells ( Figure 5 , E and F ) was coincident with the SPB marker Sad1 ( Hagan and Yanagida , 1995 ) . Localization to the centromeres was confirmed by immunofluorescence showing that the staining was positioned along the mitotic spindle and coincided with Bub1 ( Figure 5 , E and F ) , a centromere marker ( Bernard et al . , 1998 ) . Recently , observations on GFP - labeled Bub1 in live cells have questioned its use as a centromere marker because no staining was seen after centromeres had separated ( Toyoda et al . , 2002 ) . However , our observations on such a strain ( our unpublished results ) showed multiple dots during mitosis as was observed earlier ( Bernard et al . , 1998 ) , confirming the usefulness of Bub1 as a centromere marker . In conclusion , the localization of S . pombe homologues of Nsl1p and Spc105 to the centromeres supports the conclusion that these are indeed centromere proteins in S . cerevisiae . Phenotype of nsl1 - 5 Cells All four genes encoding components of the Mtw1p complex have previously been shown to be essential , and the phenotypes of Ts – mutants in MTW1 and NNF1 have been described ( Shan et al . , 1997 ; Goshima and Yanagida , 2000 ; Euskirchen , 2002 ) . mtw1 - 1 cells arrest with intermediate - length spindles , with defects in chromosome segregation apparent in about one third of the cells ( Goshima and Yanagida , 2000 ) , and nnf1 - 17 cells arrest with variable - length spindles ( Euskirchen , 2002 ) . The phenotype of nsl1 - 5 cells synchronized in G 1 and released at 36 ° C showed some similarities to mtw1 - 1 and nnf1 - 17 . All cells arrested with either short or intermediate - length spindles and with about a diploid DNA content ( Figure 6L ) ; the arrest continued for up to 3 h , during which no defects in chromosome segregation could be 18 seen by DAPI staining ( our unpublished results ) . At later time points ( 3 - 4 h ) , the proportion of cells with spindles decreased , and cells containing apparent single asters with variable DAPI staining increased to 59 % at 4 h . These cells may have resulted from spindle breakdown or , to a lesser extent , from the small proportion of cells with long anaphase spindles ( 5 % at 3 - 3 . 5 h ) . These anaphase spindles also showed no clear defect in chromosome segregation by DAPI staining ( Figure 6C ) , but when chromosome V was marked with GFP at the URA3 locus , a clear defect in segregation was seen in 22 % of cells with such spindles ( Figure 6 , A - C ) . This phenotype is similar to that found in other centromere mutants , such as dam1 - 11 and duo1 - 2 mad2 ∆ ( Cheeseman et al . , 2001b ) , mtw1 - 1 ( Goshima and Yanagida , 2000 ) , and ask1 - 3 mad2 ∆ ( Li et al . , 2002 ) . These defective anaphase cells were a small proportion of the total , so we also looked for a defect at earlier time points , when all the nsl1 - 5 cells have shorter spindles . Here we observed GFP - labeled centromeres ( Goshima and Yanagida , 2000 ; He et al . , 2000 ; Tanaka et al . , 2000 ) in live cells between 1 . 5 - 2 . 5 h after release . Cells were observed in a single focal plane ( Pearson et al . , 2001 ) , adjusted manually to maintain focus . This has the advantage that data are gathered within 0 . 2 sec but the disadvantage that data can be lost for a period if spindles swivel at an angle to the focal plane . Because of radiation damage , the number of observations was limited to those permitting wild - type cells to pass through anaphase B . Of seven wild - type cells followed , six passed through anaphase B , and all of these showed separation and transient pairing of centromeres ( Figure 6D ) prior to anaphase B ( He et al . , 2000 ; Tanaka et al . , 2000 ) . In contrast , a clear defect in chromosome segregation was apparent in about one third of nsl1 - 5 cells ( 50 cells examined ) . In these cells , only three GFP spots were observed ( Figure 6E ) , suggesting that the centromeres had failed to split , and this was confirmed by immunofluorescence ( Figure 6F ) . The proportion of such cells was constant through the period after release . In 14 cells whose centromeres did split , transient pairing like that seen in wild - type cells was infrequent ( Figure 6G ) , and was found in only two of the 14 cells ( Figure 6H ) . Although we cannot rule out transient pairing whilst some of the spots were out of focus or during gaps in the 19 observations , pairing was easy to observe in wild - type cells under similar conditions ( Figure 6D ) . Any inhibition of pairing was not caused by lack of mobility of the centromeres , because they clearly moved relative to the poles during the period of observation ( Figure 6G ) . We repeated these observations in mtw1 - 11 ( strain VNY119 ) and obtained similar results . Again , one third of cells failed to split their centromeres , and possible pairing was observed in only one cell out of 13 examined ( our unpublished results ) . This result is in agreement with observations on asynchronous mtw1 - 1 cells after 3 h of arrest , where just under half the cells contained unsplit centromeres ( Goshima and Yanagida , 2000 ) . In conclusion , these results show that nsl1 - 5 cells , like mtw1 mutant cells , undergo a prolonged arrest in mitosis and show several defects in chromosome segregation . These include a failure of spindle attachment in some anaphase cells , a failure of centromeres to split in some cells , and a much lowered frequency of centromere pairing . Phenotype of dsn1 - 7 Cells The phenotype of dsn1 - 7 was initially quite similar to those of mutants in the other Mtw1p complex components : all the cells initially arrested with short or intermediate - length spindles and a mainly diploid DNA content ( Figure 6L and our unpublished results ) . However , after about 40 min of arrest , clear defects in chromosome segregation were seen by DAPI staining . Spindles in about 25 % of the cells had elongated sufficiently to show that 96 % of these had segregated one SPB that was associated with little DNA staining ( Figure 6 , I - K ) . There also appeared to be some spindle instability , because nearly half of the intermediate - length spindles had reduced or very little anti - tubulin staining in the central region . It was difficult to see segregation defects in most of these spindles because the large area of DAPI staining overlapped the spindle ( our unpublished results ) . At 3 h after release from α - factor , half of the cells or buds with single microtubule asters ( 82 % of the total cells ) were aploid or contained little DNA ( upper left cell in Figure 6 , I - K ) . Such aploid cells or buds probably arise in two 20 ways . First , the elongated anaphase spindles that fail to segregate DNA would result in one aploid and one diploid cell . Second , in the case of the unstable intermediate - length spindles , if one of the SPBs was not attached to chromosomes , then it might be segregated by cytoplasmic microtubules as in ndc1 - 1 ( Winey et al . , 1993 ) . The failure of chromosomes to attach to one pole in the dsn1 - 7 mutant is very similar to the phenotype found with Ts – mutants in some other centromere components : ndc10 - 1 ( Goh and Kilmartin , 1993 ) , ndc80 - 1 ( Wigge et al . , 1998 ) , and spc24 and spc25 ( Janke et al . , 2001 ; Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ) . Activation of the Mad2p - Dependent Checkpoint in nsl1 - 5 and dsn1 - 7 Mutants During mitosis , the transition to anaphase is regulated by the Mad2p - dependent checkpoint ( Li and Murray , 1991 ; Wang and Burke , 1995 ) . Defects in mitosis prior to anaphase can activate this checkpoint and arrest mitosis . Both the nsl1 - 5 and dsn1 - 7 mutants showed a delay in mitosis , suggesting Mad2p activation . To test for this , we prepared ts strains containing deletions of MAD2 and expressing myc - tagged Pds1p , which is a convenient marker for metaphase since Pds1p is completely degraded during the metaphase to anaphase transition ( Cohen - Fix et al . , 1996 ) by the anaphase - promoting complex . The cells were synchronized , and the budding indices were measured together with the proportions of Pds1p - positive cells and Pds1p - negative anaphase cells containing long spindles . In wild - type cells , the proportion of Pds1p - positive cells corresponds almost exactly to the proportion of short and intermediate - length spindles . This also held true for the two mutants for up to 2 - 2 . 5 h of the block . After this there was an increasing proportion of Pds1p - positive cells containing apparent single asters , probably due to spindle breakdown . As shown in Figure 7 , A and D , wild - type cells showed a rapid increase in Pds1p - positive cells as spindles were formed , followed by a decrease between 80 and 100 min , as cells entered anaphase ( Yamamoto et al . , 1996 ) . In contrast , nsl1 - 5 cells showed a 21 long delay in Pds1p breakdown , which did not start until around 160 min , followed by the appearance of some Pds1p - negative cells containing anaphase spindles ( Figure 7 , B and E ) . This delay in Pds1p breakdown was almost completely abolished when MAD2 was deleted , and there was a concomitant earlier appearance of Pds1p - negative cells containing anaphase spindles ( Figure 7 , C and F ) . Interestingly , these spindles , in contrast to those observed in the MAD2 + cells , did show abnormalities in chromosome segregation , with unequal DAPI staining at the two poles in 82 % of the spindles examined ( Figure 7 , K - M ) . The nsl1 - 5 cells were also examined by flow cytometry , but no clear conclusions could be made because variations in the amount of DNA per cell caused the signal to smear ( our unpublished results ) . The shorter mitotic delay shown by dsn1 - 7 cells ( Figure 7 , G and I ) was also Mad2p - dependent , since in the mad2 ∆ cells the decline in Pds1p staining started at about the same time as in wild - type cells ( Figure 7 , H and J ) . These results show that most of the delay in mitosis shown by nsl1 - 5 and dsn1 - 7 cells is Mad2p - dependent . Phenotypes of spc105 and ydr532c mutants In order to study the function of the Spc105p complex , we prepared two ts mutants , spc105 - 4 and spc105 - 15 . When we observed the phenotypes of these in synchronized cells , as in Figure 6 , we could see no difference between the mutants and wild - type cells over 4 h at 36 ˚ C . To find out what was happening , we examined the phenotype of the deletion ( spc105 ∆ ) . Our previous study ( Wigge et al . , 1998 ) had suggested that SPC105 is probably an essential gene , because sporulation of a heterozygous diploid yielded inviable spc105 ∆ spores . However , spc105 ∆ cells can survive , since deletion cells rescued by SPC105 on a URA plasmid ( strain PWY 199 ) will grow very slowly on fluoroorotic acid plates , on which the URA plasmid is lost . However , backcrossing these cells showed they had accumulated additional mutations , so they were not studied further ( Wigge et al . , 1998 ) . In view of the phenotypes of the ts spc105 alleles , we re - examined the growth rates of spc105 ∆ spores . We observed that all 22 four spores from the heterozygous diploid PWY92 grew at similar rates for up to 14 h at 23 ˚ C , when there were between 4 and 8 cells per spore clone ( cells were teased apart with a needle for counting ) . At 17 h , some of the spore clones started to grow more slowly , and by 26 h , all of the spc105 ∆ clones had arrested with between 9 and 28 cells ( the average was 12 ± 6 ) . The finding that spc105 ∆ spores grow normally for up to three divisions may explain why we saw no phenotype in the Ts – mutants after 4 h at 36 ˚ C . ydr532c ∆ spores ( from strain MSY104 ) had a similar phenotype but a larger microcolony size . Mutant spore colonies were indistinguishable from wild - type for up to 26 h of growth at 23 ˚ C ; growth then slowed , with cells eventually arresting at a microcolony size of between 42 and 114 cells ( the average was 71 ± 21 ) . The phenotypes of spc105 - 4 and spc105 - 15 were very similar . Growth arrest at 37 ˚ C occurred after the formation of microcolonies that were more variable in size , containing 7 to 174 cells , together with some larger colonies presumably due to reversion . Given the evidence that Spc105p and Ydr532p are centromere proteins , the most likely reason for the eventual growth arrest is cumulative chromosome loss . We tested for chromosome loss in spc105 mutants with two methods : first , observing the behavior of GFP - labeled chromosomes ( Straight et al . , 1996 ) in synchronized cells at 36 ˚ C ; and second , using a chromosome loss plate assay ( Spencer et al . , 1990 ) . We used spc105 - 15 rather than spc105 - 4 for these experiments because it showed a greater effect . Failures in chromosome segregation ( Figure 8A ) were observed in 9 % of spc105 - 15 cells ( this varied between 5 and 14 % in different experiments ) , compared to 0 . 7 % ( 1 / 150 ) in wild - type cells . We confirmed this phenotype using the chromosome - loss plate assay , in which cells carry a mini - chromosome CFIII containing SUP11 , which suppresses ade2 - 101 . If CFIII is lost , the ade2 - 101 mutation causes accumulation of a red pigment , and colonies are red or sectored red , while cells carrying CFIII remain white . At 30 ˚ C , spc105 - 15 cells , in contrast to wild - type cells , showed mainly red or red - sectored colonies ( Figure 8 , D and E ) , confirming that Spc105p has a function in chromosome segregation . 23 Genetic Interactions within and between the Mtw1p , Spc105p , Ndc80p , and Dam1p / DDD / DASH Complexes We looked for in vivo evidence for interactions both within and between the Mtw1p and Spc105p complexes we have characterized here , the Ndc80p complex ( Janke et al . , 2001 ; Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ) , and the Dam1p / DDD / DASH complex , which has been localized to the spindle and to centromeres by ChIP assay ( Cheeseman et al . , 2001a ; Janke et al . , 2002 ; Li et al . , 2002 ) . We restricted ourselves to these four complexes because of the evidence that three of them are closely associated , and because subunits of all four of them have been identified in our enriched spindle pole preparation ( Wigge et al . , 1998 ; Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ) , suggesting that some of them might be in close proximity . We found a genetic interaction within the Spc105p complex in that overexpression of YDR532c on a 2µ plasmid could suppress both spc105 - 4 ( Figure 9A ) and spc105 - 15 ( our unpublished results ) . We also looked for genetic interactions between ts mutations of components in the four complexes . Examples of some of the interactions found are shown in Figure 9B , and all of the interactions are summarized in Figure 9C . Synthetic - lethal interactions were found between mutations affecting several subunits of the Mtw1p , Ndc80p , and Spc105p complexes ( Figure 9C ) , in agreement with their close association ( Figure 1 ) . However , only synthetic growth defects were found between mutations affecting subunits of these three complexes and those affecting three of the subunits of the Dam1p / DDD / DASH complex ( Figure 9 , B and C ) . No interactions were found with duo1 - 61 ; thus , this allele is excluded from the dam1 , ask1 , and dad1 group in Figure 9C . These genetic results support the close association between the Mtw1p , Ndc80p , and Spc105p complexes , as shown in Figure 1 , and suggest a less close relationship between these three complexes and the Dam1p / DDD / DASH complex . This is in agreement with the clear but weaker interactions recently found between components of the Ndc80p and Dam1p / DDD / DASH complexes ( Shang et al . , 2003 ) . 24 25 Discussion In this paper , we describe five components of the S . cerevisiae centromere and show that the homologues of two of these are probably components of the S . pombe centromere . This brings the number of proteins currently identified for the S . cerevisiae centromere to over 40 ( Figure 10 ) , excluding checkpoint proteins , kinesins , cohesions , and specialized kinases . The picture that emerges is one of increasing complexity for what is probably one of the simplest eukaryote centromeres . At present , we do not know the precise functions of the centromere components we have identified in this paper . However , they have a clear role in chromosome segregation , and Nsl1p may have a role in transient centromere pairing . Our protein A isolations , particularly the Dsn1p - protein A isolation ( Figure 1E ) , suggest that the Mtw1p , Spc105p , and Ndc80p complexes are closely associated . Such an association is supported by the synthetic - lethal interactions found between ts mutations of components of the three complexes ( Figure 9 ) . Additional evidence for these associations comes from two - hybrid results suggesting that the coiled - coil regions of Nnf1p can interact with the coiled - coil regions of Ndc80p , Nuf2p , and Spc105p ( Newman et al . , 2000 ) . What is the relationship between these complexes and the other S . cerevisiae centromere components and complexes already identified ? We propose a tentative arrangement of S . cerevisiae centromere components into four different groups ( Figure 10 ) . The first group contains components that associate laterally with microtubules , as shown by direct binding or immunofluorescence , and in addition associate with the centromere as shown by ChIP assay , indicating that they can be close to the kinetochore . The second group is associated with the centromere but has shown no evidence , so far , of lateral binding to microtubules . These proteins may bind directly or indirectly to the plus ends of microtubules , but this has yet to be shown . The third group has very similar properties to the second group , and is only distinguished from it by the fact that none of 26 the proteins in the third group , apart from Mtw1p , has been detected in highly enriched spindle pole preparations ( Wigge et al . , 1998 ; Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ) . Because these preparations have been digested with DNaseI , this suggests that this third group might be more closely associated with the fourth group , which contains centromere DNA - binding proteins as measured by band - shift assays . Consistent with this hypothesis is evidence for interactions between Ctf19p and both Ndc10p ( Ortiz et al . , 1999 ) and Cse1p ( Chen et al . , 2000 ) . There is one apparent discrepancy in these groupings , which is the presence of Mtw1p both in group 2 , in the Mtw1p complex , and in group 3 , in the Ctf19p complex ( Cheeseman et al . , 2002a ) . We are confident of our assignment of Mtw1p to group 2 based on the biochemical , genetic , and two - hybrid results summarized above . Moreover , it should be noted that the close association between the Ndc80p , Mtw1p , and Spc105p complexes has been shown using two quite different isolation methods , first by the protein A method used here , and second by the presence of components of the three complexes in the enriched spindle pole preparations ( Wigge et al . , 1998 ; Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ) . In neither of these preparations have components of the Ctf19p complex other than Mtw1p been detected . One possibility might be that Mtw1p is a bridge between two parts of the centromere ( groups 2 and 3 in Figure 10 ) , and depending on the precise conditions of lysis and extraction , either group 2 or group 3 complexes are isolated . An obvious question with regard to the second group of centromere components , which are presumably associated with the microtubules in the enriched spindle pole preparation , is whether they may be localized to the plus end of the microtubule . The presence of at least one of the group 2 components , Ndc80p , in the spindle pole preparation is microtubule - dependent , because we previously showed that removal of the microtubules by DEAE - dextran extraction , which leaves the SPB intact , also removes Ndc80p ( Rout and Kilmartin , 1990 ) . Tomographic reconstructions of the S . cerevisiae spindle ( O ' Toole et al . , 1999 ) show flared ends on most of the discontinuous microtubules , which probably correspond to the plus ends of the kinetochore 27 microtubules . The flared ends could expose the inside of the microtubule , which would in turn expose a unique set of binding sites on tubulin at the plus end of the microtubule . It will be interesting to determine whether some of the group 2 complexes bind to these or other sites on the microtubule , and what other complexes , if any , are necessary for this . Many of the kinetochore / centromere components listed in Figure 10 are conserved in S . pombe , an evolutionarily distant organism with a structurally different centromere . This suggests a fundamental conservation of at least part of the centromere structure since early in evolution . Does this conservation extend among all eukaryotes ? This is still an open question . Vertebrate homologues have been identified for a few of the proteins listed in Figure 10 . These now include homologues of three group 2 components , Ndc80p , Nuf2p , and Mtw1p ( Chen et al . , 1997 ; Nabetani et al . , 2001 ; Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ; Goshima et al . , 2003 ) . RNA interference or antibody depletion experiments have shown a clear role at the centromere for these three homologues ( DeLuca et al . , 2002 ; Martin - Lluesma et al . , 2002 ; Goshima et al . , 2003 ; Hori et al . , 2003 ; McCleland et al . , 2003 ) , and the Ndc80p and Nuf2p homologues were shown to be associated with each other , suggesting that the Ndc80p complex itself is conserved ( Hori et al . , 2003 ; McCleland et al . , 2003 ) . These results raise the possibility that all of the group 2 complexes and their interactions , as described in this paper , may be conserved in vertebrate centromeres . The main barrier to finding homologues of the other complex components is their high sequence divergence , preventing identification of even S . pombe homologues . However , this barrier may now be overcome by sequence data from other Saccharomyces species ( Cliften et al . , 2003 ; Kellis et al . , 2003 ) and fungi , which can establish the conserved residues and allow identification of homologues . An alternative approach is isolation of the human complex , once one human homologue has been identified and tagged with protein A . This has already been done for several other conserved human complexes ( Gavin et al . , 2002 ) , and has identified the divergent human subunits . In this way , relationships between novel human centromere components can be explored , similar to the way protein - A tagging has been used to establish some of the relationships within the yeast centromere . 28 29 Acknowledgements We are grateful to Farida Begum for assistance with the mass spectrometry , Phil Wigge for the spc105 ts plasmids , Ross Overman for technical help in strain and plasmid construction , the late Douglas Kershaw for cutting the serial thin sections and Attila Toth for help and advice .

( A - I ) SDS gels of the complexes isolated from strains ( names in brackets ) containing the indicated protein A ( pA ) - tagged proteins . ( A and G ) Mtw1p ( MSY5 ) , ( B and I ) Spc105p ( PWY282 ) , ( C ) Ydr532p ( MSY48 ) , ( D ) Nnf1p ( VNY34 ) , ( E ) Dsn1p ( VNY38 ) , ( F ) Nsl1p ( VNY32 ) , and ( H ) Ndc80p ( PWY350 ) . Gels A - C were from the first fraction off the columns and gels D - I from the second fraction , which usually contains more material but also more contaminants . All the gels were Coomassie - stained except A and C , which were silver - stained . In gels D - I , the sample wells were loaded as fully as possible , which caused some distortion in the band shape . In ( E ) , the lower band labeled Dsn1pA was a proteolytic fragment since it contained peptides from both Dsn1p and protein A . In ( F ) , no further proteins were identified in the Nnf1p region of this gel . Bands a - g were identified as Rpn1p ( a ) , Sen3p ( b , only identified in gels F and G ) , Ssa1p , Ssa2p or both ( c ) , Hsp60p ( d ) , Tef2p ( e ) , Ydj1p ( f ) , and Scj1p ( g ) . Rpn1p and Sen3p are proteosome components , Ssa1p , Ssa2p , Hsp60p , Ydj1p , and Scj1p are heat shock factors , and Tef2p is elongation factor . Further information on these proteins can be found at http : / / www . yeastgenome . org / . It seems likely that all of these are contaminants since they have been found in isolations with non - centromeric proteins coupled to protein A ( our unpublished results ) , and most are absent from the cleaner gels ( A - C ) . ( J ) Immunoblot of immunoprecipitates ( IP ) obtained as described in Materials and Methods using strains containing HA - tagged Spc105p only ( VNY290 ) , or both HA - tagged Spc105p and protein A - tagged Ndc80p ( VNY296 ) . This shows that upon enriching for Ndc80pA , trace amounts of Spc105 - HA can be detected . ( K ) Summary of the interactions observed . 49 Figure 2 . Localization of GFP - tagged proteins in relation to the SPBs ( imaged with Spc42p - CFP ) in unfixed cells of the indicated strains . The left three columns show the GFP ( red ) , CFP ( green ) and merged images for a cell of each strain with a short spindle . The right column shows the merged image for a cell with a longer spindle ; note the splitting of the GFP image . ( A - D ) Nnf1p ( JK1694 ) , ( E - H ) Nsl1p ( JK1682 ) , ( I - L ) Dsn1p ( JK1683 ) , ( M - P ) Spc105p ( JK1679 ) , and ( Q - T ) Ydr532p ( JK1676 ) . There is a small amount of carryover of the GFP signal into the CFP channel . Bar , 2 µm . Figure 3 . ImmunoEM of GFP - tagged proteins in the indicated strains . ( A and B ) Nnf1p ( VNY3 ) , ( C and D ) Nsl1p ( VNY50 ) , ( E and F ) Dsn1p ( VNY28 ) , ( G and H ) Spc105p ( MSY52 ) , and ( I and J ) Ydr532p ( JK1495 ) . Staining is seen between SPBs in short spindles ( left side ) and in association with the nuclear face in all other SPBs ( right side ) . Bar , 0 . 1 µm . Figure 4 . ChIP assays on protein A - tagged ndc10 - 1 strains and on the wild - type strain K699 as a negative control . Assays were carried out at 23 ˚ C ( left ) , where the centromere is intact in ndc10 - 1 cells , and at 37 ˚ C ( right ) , where the centromere is dissociated . Multiplex PCR was used to detect CEN3 and two regions 4 kb on either side . P is the pellet after enrichment with IgG Sepharose , and T , 1 % of the total input , is the starting material . From left to right , the strains used were JK1670 , JK1673 , JK1667 , JK1669 , JK1664 , and K699 . Figure 5 . ( A ) Alignment of Nsl1p sequences from S . cerevisiae ( Sc ) , C . albicans ( Ca ) , and S . pombe ( Sp ) ; the last nine amino acids of the Candida homologue have been omitted . Black and grey boxes indicate identical and similar residues , respectively . ( B ) Schematic view of the Spc105p homologues from the same three species . ME / DLT repeats are shown by short vertical lines , and coiled - coil domains found by Paircoil ( Berger et al . , 1995 ) are shown by black boxes . ( C and D ) Localization of GFP - tagged SpNsl1 ( C1 and C2 ) and SpSpc105 ( D1 and D2 ) in live S . pombe cells . Long cells in 50 which the GFP spots had begun to split , indicating entry into mitosis , were followed , and images were recorded when these cells were about to complete anaphase A ( C1 and D1 ) . These images show between five and six dots , which then coalesced into two separated dots several minutes later as the cells entered anaphase B ( C2 and D2 ) . ( E and F ) Fluorescence of GFP compared with immunofluorescence with anti - Sad1 , anti - tubulin , and anti - HA - tagged SpBub1 is shown in ( E ) for SpNsl1 ( strain JK1636 ) and in ( F ) for SpSpc105 ( strain JK1627 ) . Bars , 2 µm . Figure 6 . Phenotypes of nsl1 - 5 ( A - C and E - H ) and dsn1 - 7 ( I - K ) mutants , and of a wild - type control ( D ) ; flow cytometry for the three strains is also shown ( L ) . Cells were synchronized in G 1 with α - factor at 23 ˚ C and released at 36 ˚ C . ( A - C ) An nsl1 - 5 cell in which the URA3 locus is labeled with GFP ( strain VNY287 ) was fixed during anaphase ( 3 h after release ) and processed for immunofluorescence with anti - tubulin ( A ) , and anti - GFP ( B ) , and stained with DAPI ( C ) . Chromosome V has failed to segregate . ( D - H ) Imaging of GFP - labeled SPBs and CEN5 in wild - type ( D , strain K8572 ) and nsl1 - 5 cells ( E - H , strain VNY122 ) . ( D ) A wild - type cell underwent centromere pairing and passed through anaphase during the period of observation . ( E ) An nsl1 - 5 cell where the centromeres failed to split . ( F ) A fixed nsl1 - 5 cell was processed for immunofluorescence using anti - GFP and anti - Tub4p to identify SPBs . Centromeres ( the lowest GFP spot ) have not split . ( G ) One of the majority of nsl1 - 5 cells , in which the centromeres split but failed to pair during the period of observation . ( H ) An nsl1 - 5 cell in which pairing occurred . Symbols in ( G ) and ( H ) are the same as in ( D ) . ( I - K ) dsn1 - 7 cells ( strain VNY96 ) were processed for immunofluorescence 2 . 5 h after release using anti - tubulin ( I ) , anti - Tub4p for SPBs ( J ) , and DAPI ( K ) . Two anaphase cells that have failed to segregate DNA and one aploid cell ( top left ) are shown . ( L ) Flow cytometry of wild - type ( K699 ) , nsl1 - 5 ( VNY72 ) , and dsn1 - 7 ( VNY96 ) cells . Bars , 2 µm . Figure 7 . The arrest of nsl1 - 5 and dsn1 - 7 mutants during mitosis is Mad2p - dependent . ( A - J ) Wild - type ( A and D ; K6445 ) , nsl1 - 5 ( B and E ; VNY130 ) , nsl1 - 5 mad2 ∆ ( C and F ; 51 VNY318 ) , dsn1 - 7 ( G and I ; VNY116 ) , and dsn1 - 7 mad2 ∆ ( H and J ; VNY283 ) cells were synchronized in G 1 with α - factor and released at 36 ˚ C . The percentage of cells with small buds , large buds , or two buds was plotted against time ( A - C , G , and H ) , as were the percentages of Pds1p - positive cells and Pds1p - negative cells containing anaphase spindles as determined by immunofluorescence ( D - F , I and J ) . ( K - M ) Immunofluorescence of nsl1 - 5 mad2 ∆ cells stained with anti - tubulin ( K ) , DAPI ( L ) , and anti - myc for Pds1p ( M ) . Pds1p - negative cells with anaphase spindles show unequal DNA segregation . Bar , 2 µm . Figure 8 . spc105 - 15 cells are defective in chromosome segregation . ( A - C ) spc105 - 15 cells in which the URA3 locus is labeled with GFP ( strain VNY203 ) were synchronized in G 1 with α - factor , released at 36 ˚ C for 2 h , fixed , and stained with anti - GFP ( A ) , anti - tubulin ( B ) , and DAPI for DNA ( C ) . ( D and E ) Colony - sectoring assay for chromosome loss in wild - type ( D ; strain K7049 ) and spc105 - 15 ( E ; strain VNY198 ) cells carrying the CFIII mini - chromosome after incubation on low adenine YEPD for 3 days at 30 ˚ C . The red colonies ( dark in the figure ) and sectors show chromosome loss . Bar , 2 µm . Figure 9 . Genetic interactions within and between the Spc105p , Mtw1p , Ndc80p , and Dam1p / DDD / DASH complexes . ( A ) Suppression of spc105 - 4 by overxpression of Ydr532p . Strains were MSY150 , MSY151 , and MSY152 . ( B ) Examples of the synthetic growth defects at 30 ˚ C between mutations in the different complexes . ( C ) A summary of the interactions found . Solid lines show synthetic - lethal interactions at 23 ˚ C , dashed lines show synthetic growth defects with lethality at 30 ˚ C ( see panel B ) , the dotted line shows dosage suppression ( see panel A ) , and the absence of a line indicates that no genetic interaction was found . All possible combinations between the different mutations were tested ; however , the YDR532c dosage suppression was only tested in the spc105 alleles . The synthetic - lethal interactions within the Ndc80p and Mtw1p complexes have been described previously ( Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ; Euskirchen , 2002 ) . The ask1 , dam1 , and dad1 alleles are not distinguished because they gave similar results in all the 52 crosses tested , with the exception of the dam1 - 31 mtw1 - 11 cross , in which no interaction was found . duo1 is excluded from the ask1 , dad1 , and dam1 group because duo1 - 61 showed no genetic interactions with any of the other alleles . Strains used were JK1121 , JK1504 , MSY72 , MSY79 , MSY87 , MSY90 , PWY483 , PWY754 , VNY69 , VNY87 , VNY96 , and VNY162 . Figure 10 . Possible groupings of S . cerevisiae centromere and kinetochore components . Components in bold type have known human homologues . Groups 1 and 2 contain components ( with asterisks ) that have been detected in spindle pole preparations by MALDI mass spectrometry ( Wigge et al . , 1998 ; Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ) . Group 1 components associate laterally with microtubules and have also been detected at the centromere by ChIP assay . Group 2 components localize to the centromere only ; the dashed line symbolizes the close association of these complexes . Nearly all group 3 components ( Meluh and Koshland , 1995 ; Cheeseman et al . , 2002a ; Pot et al . , 2003 ) have been localized to the centromere only and have not been detected in spindle pole preparations ( except for Mtw1p - see text ) . Group 4 components bind centromere DNA directly as judged by band shift assay . References for most of these components can be found in the Introduction .
