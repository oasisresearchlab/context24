Large language models ( LLMs ) hold im - mense potential for addressing this gap by permitting open - ended inputs , including the ability to customize interventions to individuals’ unique needs . However , user expecta - tions and potential limitations of LLMs in this context remain underexplored . To address this , we conducted interviews and focus group discussions with 15 university students and 6 experts , during which a technology probe for generating personalized advice for managing procrastination was presented . Our results highlight the necessity for LLMs to provide structured , deadline - oriented steps and enhanced user support mechanisms . Ad - ditionally , our results surface the need for an adaptive approach to questioning based on factors like busyness . These findings offer crucial design implications for the development of LLM - based tools for managing procrastination while cautioning the use of LLMs for therapeutic guidance . Keywords : Procrastination , Personalized Reflections , GPT - 4 , ChatGPT , Large Language Models , Education 1 Introduction Procrastination , defined as the intentional delay of tasks despite known negative consequences [ 3 , 28 , 92 ] , is especially widespread in academic settings . Prior research indicates that at least half of all college students engage in chronic procrastination [ 37 , 101 ] , which can negatively 1 a r X i v : 2312 . 13581v1 [ c s . H C ] 21 D ec 2023 impact their academic performance and overall wellbeing . Researchers have developed a range of interventions for procrastination management , focusing on task completion [ 3 , 49 ] , time management [ 49 , 59 ] , and personalized motivation [ 94 , 107 ] . However , they frequently fail to capture the nuanced factors that contribute to procrastination , such as individual learning styles and environmental influences [ 12 , 64 ] . The challenge lies in these factors being subjective and difficult to quantify , rendering traditional interventions less effective . Large language models ( LLMs ) have recently garnered significant attention for their capa - bility to act as personalized intervention tools and supportive scaffolds in numerous settings [ 1 , 3 , 66 , 72 , 109 , 114 ] . With their computational prowess and linguistic sophistication , these models can analyze a vast array of variables via text - based input , potentially offering a level of personalization and support that is difficult to achieve with traditional intervention methods . LLMs also stand out due to their dynamic interaction capabilities , surpassing the constraints of generic surveys and rule - based chatbots that lack conversational depth and follow - up ca - pabilities . In the context of academic procrastination , the potential of LLMs lies not in re - placing traditional methods like setting reminders or automatic scheduling , but in their ability to contextualize and intelligently integrate a broad spectrum of procrastination management strategies . By leveraging extensive datasets and natural language processing techniques , LLMs may possess the ability to craft advice and recommendations that are highly tailored to an indi - vidual’s unique academic and personal circumstances [ 71 , 79 ] . For instance , an LLM could ask a student about their upcoming deadlines and work schedule to collaboratively help them generate micro - deadlines that fit into their schedule . Knowing that the student has two term papers and a part - time job , the LLM might advise dedicating the first two hours after work on a specific day to outlining one of the term papers . This sort of targeted advice has the potential to acknowledge students’ unique circumstances and constraints , thereby increasing the likelihood of the advice being both practical and effective . However , LLMs cannot be trivially adapted for such intervention personalization . They currently lack the innate capacity to perceive users’ emotional states or to navigate the com - plexities and subjectivity of intricate social contexts ( although this may change with future advancements ) [ 120 ] . Therefore , users need to provide such nuanced information for LLMs to offer effective personalized recommendations , and the applicability of the recommendations they receive depends substantially on the depth of the information provided [ 72 ] . It is also important for researchers to understand which intervention elements users wish to personalize . For instance , in the context of academic procrastination , users may desire an option to specify the type of support they need , such as reminders for deadlines versus tips for time management . Insights into these user expectations can guide the design of prompts to elicit targeted and use - ful responses through prompt engineering , aligning closely with what users seek in managing procrastination [ 4 , 115 ] . They may even help adapt the attention mechanisms within LLMs [ 112 ] to focus on certain keywords or contextual clues within a user’s query or text input , such as deadlines , emotional states , or specific tasks . Without such insights , there is a risk that de - velopers create LLM - based tools that are misaligned with user needs and expectations [ 9 , 53 ] . Finally , an understanding of the limitations and guardrails required for LLM - based tools in this space is also important to ensure that intervention adjustments are still consistent with validated strategies or clinical guidelines . Motivated by both the challenges and opportunities in applying LLMs to intervention per - sonalization , as well as their potential to act as a supportive scaffold , we explore how students can use an LLM - based tool to manage academic procrastination . Specifically , our focus extends to task initiation , deadline management , emotional regulation , and addressing the impact of social and environmental factors on academic performance . We aim to understand how users envision the ways in which LLMs might facilitate these strategies for managing academic pro - 2 crastination . At the same time , we attempt to identify potential limitations of LLMs and design tensions that should be considered for future tools in this space . Our work is motivated by the following research questions : RQ1 : How do users envision the role of LLMs in tailoring strategies for managing academic procrastination ? RQ2 : What challenges or tensions might arise when using LLMs for tailoring strategies to manage academic procrastination ? In this study , we interacted with 15 university students through individual interviews and focus groups to delve into how they perceive the potential of LLM - based tools in mitigating academic procrastination . Before posing questions , we offered participants an opportunity to engage with a functional technology probe [ 14 , 47 ] , specifically designed to incorporate strategies for managing procrastination . This probe served as a contextual anchor for their subsequent recommendations for the design of LLM - based tools for procrastination management . To bolster our results , we also consulted six experts from the fields of clinical psychology , education , and cognitive science to validate our findings and explore potential design challenges . Our study illuminates key preferences and concerns regarding the use of LLM - based tools in managing academic procrastination . Participants highlighted a preference for structured , deadline - focused planning coupled with real - world examples for guidance . In contrast , experts advised caution regarding the scope of these tools , emphasizing the need for emotional vali - dation and critical thinking rather than therapeutic intervention . These findings enhance our understanding of human - LLM collaboration , advocating for a balance between methodical task management and adherence to ethical standards in emotional support . The design recommen - dations derived from our study call for flexible guidance systems and seamless integration into daily routines while setting clear boundaries for the emotional aspects of procrastination man - agement . Overall , our work not only identifies specific user requirements for managing academic procrastination but also contributes to the discourse on the ethical and efficient deployment of LLM - based tools in diverse contexts . 2 Related Work We first delve into existing literature concerning the application of LLMs in academic envi - ronments , focusing specifically on their use in personalization and contextual adaptation , their role as a supportive scaffold , and the ethical challenges that arise from their use . Subsequently , we turn our attention to prior interventions aimed at mitigating academic procrastination . 2 . 1 Application of LLMs in Academic Settings The emergence of LLMs has introduced new possibilities in learning and education . Within academic settings , they have the potential to serve multiple roles — from personalizing learning experiences to providing task - oriented support [ 1 , 3 , 79 , 106 , 122 ] . As a result , researchers have started exploring the role of LLM - based tools in different phases of education , including content creation and summarization , student evaluation , collaborative data analysis , and research [ 1 , 25 , 40 , 65 , 66 , 79 , 116 ] . One of the most salient strengths of LLMs in educational settings is their capacity for personalization and contextual adaptation [ 25 , 61 , 66 , 114 ] . It has sparked several potential application areas in the academic arena , although much of the current research is exploratory in nature and yet to be validated on a large scale [ 54 ] . Educational platforms equipped with LLMs have been used to analyze the historical data of a student’s essay submissions , allowing 3 them to suggest areas of improvement [ 109 ] and to identify recurring grammatical errors or stylistic issues [ 25 , 79 , 80 , 119 ] . In programming courses , LLMs might act as adaptable tutors that provide hints or suggest debugging strategies when students encounter errors in their code [ 30 , 55 , 68 , 70 ] . Unlike static FAQs or forums , the generated advice can take into account the specific syntax and logic of the student’s work . Furthermore , LLMs have the potential to facilitate personalized learning journeys by recommending courses or materials that correspond with an individual’s academic objectives and interests [ 13 , 54 , 81 ] . To illustrate , if a student indicates a desire to achieve proficiency in a specific programming language , an LLM could suggest a series of progressively challenging exercises and relevant readings , thereby offering a bespoke pathway toward mastery [ 79 ] . Beyond their capacity for personalization , LLMs also have the potential to excel as sup - portive scaffolds in academic tasks that require additional guidance or collaborative input [ 3 , 29 , 48 , 57 , 67 , 122 , 126 ] , although the research is still premature . In writing - intensive courses , LLMs might function as intelligent writing assistants [ 33 , 58 , 67 , 117 ] ; they can pro - vide more than mere copy - editing , but also real - time support in enhancing the structure and flow of arguments . They may also assist students in brainstorming ideas , organizing their thoughts , and co - creating outlines for essays or research papers [ 1 , 54 , 60 , 103 , 124 ] . Addition - ally , LLMs can be helpful for microlearning experiences , particularly in subjects that involve complex scientific concepts [ 71 , 79 ] . By breaking down complex ideas into more digestible and comprehensible explanations , they might offer students a way to incrementally strengthen their understanding . While the promises of LLMs in academic settings are manifold , these benefits come with ethical concerns that cannot be ignored [ 7 , 50 , 52 , 54 , 74 , 105 ] . One significant worry is the potentially detrimental impact LLMs can have on critical thinking and problem - solving skills [ 50 , 54 ] . The ease and immediacy of AI - generated responses may discourage students from delving deeply into subjects , opting instead for quick answers without a solid understanding of underlying principles [ 50 , 78 , 79 ] . This issue is exacerbated by the possibility that students may rely too heavily on LLMs , diminishing traditional student - teacher interactions that are often essential for learning [ 78 ] . There is also the problem of accuracy [ 24 , 85 , 87 ] . Students might not question the validity of the information provided by LLMs under the false assumption that any machine - generated information must be correct . This could lead to the unintentional dissemination of false or misleading information [ 63 , 104 ] . Such concerns could be heightened in the specific context of academic procrastination management , where erroneous or contextually inappropriate advice could have detrimental effects [ 52 , 100 ] . These ethical issues bring into focus the need for careful design and implementation strategies when incorporating LLMs into academic environments . 2 . 2 Interventions to Manage Procrastination Efforts to alleviate procrastination typically aim to close the distance between intending to act and actually taking action [ 35 , 99 ] . These efforts are multifaceted , incorporating tactics that improve self - regulation , bolster self - efficacy , and nurture social support networks [ 97 , 111 ] . Various modalities have been employed to deliver these strategies , such as self - reflection ap - plications , interactive conversational systems , technology - based interruptions , life management software , structured workshops , and therapeutic sessions [ 3 , 64 , 92 , 111 , 123 ] . A large body of work on procrastination management has focused on enhancing self - regulatory skills [ 91 ] , through nurturing positive habits like goal setting and time management [ 22 , 59 , 101 ] . Various tools have been designed to help individuals spend more time on focused tasks , thereby aiding them in meeting their goals and deadlines [ 16 , 26 , 36 , 44 , 64 , 89 ] . For instance , Pereira and D´ıaz [ 89 ] examined the effectiveness of GanttBot , a Telegram chatbot designed to reduce 4 procrastination in single - student capstone projects . Incorporating various features like alerts , advice , automatic rescheduling , motivational messages , and historical project references , the chatbot was successful in reducing the number of overdue days among students compared to a control group . A chatbot developed by Grover et al . [ 36 ] that allowed information workers to block out time in calendars and reflect on daily mood also saw similar success in helping them spend more time on focused tasks . Another prominent line of work has investigated the use of reflection and reminders as mechanisms to promote timely action and adherence to deadlines [ 5 , 31 , 46 , 76 , 121 , 123 ] . For instance , Kim et al . [ 59 ] introduced a system that encouraged self - reflection on periods of distraction , noting a moderate decrease in procrastinatory behavior among users . Similarly , Edwards et al . [ 31 ] used email reminders to inform students about their prior homework per - formance , which led to a reduction in late submissions . Further evidence from Ye et al . [ 121 ] and Humphrey Jr et al . [ 46 ] suggests that both email and text message reminders can offer moderate benefits in promoting timely submissions and improving academic performance . Other strategies for combating procrastination included direct technological interventions and the leveraging of social support [ 3 , 22 , 45 , 59 , 108 ] . For example , Inie and Lungu [ 49 ] introduced a browser extension that prompts users with microlearning activities when they attempt to visit time - wasting websites , thereby redirecting their focus . Similarly , Arakawa et al . [ 3 ] employed generative AI models to help individuals pick up where they left off on interrupted tasks by providing contextual cues , thus aiding in the transition back to the activity at hand . On the social front , studies have underscored the importance of social support in curbing procrastination [ 45 , 108 , 110 ] . Tuasikal and Patria [ 108 ] demonstrated that a higher level of social support could lead to less procrastination in thesis writing , while Hsueh et al . [ 45 ] found that being part of a larger group helped reduce distractions and improve goal - setting . However , a recurring critique of all of these interventions from procrastination management is their frequent inability to address the complex , individualized factors that contribute to procrastination [ 12 , 64 ] . Factors such as social circumstances , motivational triggers , or unique lifestyles are often challenging to incorporate into these designs . Addressing such nuanced issues could potentially benefit from the open - ended input capabilities of LLMs . However , there is a notable gap in understanding how users might perceive and interact with these LLM systems , how LLMs could enhance existing interventions , and what challenges and ethical considerations may be associated with their use . Our study aims to delve into these issues . 3 Design of the Probe In order to probe student participants’ reactions to how LLMs can be used to help them address procrastination , we developed a web - based technology probe called the Self - generated Personalized Articulations and Reflections Kit ( SPARK ) . SPARK utilizes OpenAI’s GPT - 4 model [ 84 ] to offer context - specific advice for managing procrastination . The tool was iteratively designed by our research team composed of faculty members and graduate students in human - computer interaction , natural language processing , cognitive science , and psychology . While the design of SPARK was informed by existing literature ( as described later in this section ) , our primary goal was not to propose and validate its design . Instead , our primary goal was to understand the features and affordances users would find valuable in such a tool . We believed that asking participants to generate design ideas in a vacuum could be challenging [ 12 , 69 , 104 ] ; therefore , we provided them with SPARK as a probe to elicit more informed responses . SPARK comprises four key components , each of which we elaborate upon below . 5 3 . 1 Seed Message The tool initially presented participants with a message grounded in the existing literature on procrastination management [ 6 , 91 , 92 , 96 , 110 ] . This message served as a generic blueprint for addressing procrastination and involved a subset of four strategies from prior work [ 92 , 96 ] : • Cognitive Insight : This component educates users about the complex psychological and cognitive factors contributing to procrastination , such as fear of failure and temporal discounting bias • Psychological Flexibility : This component encourages the adoption of a flexible mental stance , promoting acceptance and mindfulness . It suggests that individuals adopt the role of an observer of their own emotional and cognitive states . • Value Alignment : This component directs users to contemplate how completing the task correlates with their core values and highlights the potential costs of not adhering to these values . • Implementation Intention : This component advocates for the establishment of ac - tionable plans to align behavior with one’s values when certain thoughts or emotional triggers arise . Figure 1 : The screen through which participants saw the seed message Figure 1 illustrates how seed messages were presented , and Table 1 provides some examples of the seed messages with associated psychological principles . 3 . 2 Interface Options to Generate Context Specific Messages by LLMs To gather nuanced insights into the challenges individuals face with procrastination , we pro - vided users with an open - ended text box where they could freely share details they considered pertinent . Users also had the option to specify the tone ( formal vs . informal ) , directedness ( direct vs . indirect ) , and length of the LLM - generated message ( 50 , 100 , or 150 words ) . They could choose whether or not to include specific instructions for addressing their situation , as well as select specific prompts for generating the message ( more about this in Section 3 . 4 ) . These options were informed by prior literature on personalized advice [ 6 , 34 , 75 ] . Figure 2 ( a ) illustrates how these options were presented . The structure for generating each tailored response was dictated by a specific query format : “Adapt and rewrite [ Seed Message ] for [ User Name ] , who is facing the following challenge : [ User Situation ] . The rewritten message should be [ Selected Tone ] , [ Selected Directedness ] , and have fewer than [ Selected Length ] words . [ Include instructions on applying the message in the 6 Table 1 : Example Seed Messages . The psychological principles indicated by arrows were not part of the main text but are included here to annotate the different components of each message . Number Complete Message ( and Associated Psychological Principles ) 1 Highlight the Value . Sometimes it’s easier to avoid procrastination when we remind ourselves of why we’re doing a certain task , and how it aligns with our values , future goals . → Cognitive Insight Take time to think about the benefits of acting now - Will you feel more satisfied ? Will this move you closer to your long - term goal ? If the answer is yes , why not act now ? The sooner you start , the sooner you will get the rewards ! → Value Alignment Tell yourself , “IF I find myself delaying my goals , THEN I will remind myself why I’m doing these tasks and why they’re important to do now . ” → Implementation Intention 2 Future Is Real . We can know something without realizing it - without it becoming “real” and relevant to our lives . When you procrastinate on exercising , you are likely aware of the negative consequences on your physical health , but you may not really care about it because the nega - tive consequences can take fairly long to be detrimental . → Cognitive Insight However , that day will come sooner or later . When you are about to pro - crastinate , think about the negative consequences and how they snowball . The task may not seem pressing now , but would it still be fine if you keep procrastinating on it ? How would it change your life trajectory ? The future is not far away , it is REAL . Don’t leave guilt and regrets until it is too late . → Psychological Flexibility Tell yourself , “IF I find myself putting off a task that doesn’t seem press - ing , THEN I will remind myself that things often don’t seem pressing until it’s too late . I will get started on the task . ” → Implementation Intention 3 Own Yourself . Overcoming procrastination is about self - regulation . We know we shouldn’t procrastinate , but we are unable or unwilling to reg - ulate ourselves to act because procrastination provides immediate mood repair . → Cognitive Insight When you are about to give in to feel good , always remind yourself - you are the owner of yourself , you can control yourself , and you should control yourself . You wouldn’t wish to sacrifice something more important for immediate mood repair . You wouldn’t let desires take control over you . → Psychological Flexibility Tell yourself , “IF I find myself saying ”I feel like it tomorrow” , THEN I know it signals giving in , and I will just start on the task that I’m procrastinating . ” → Implementation Intention 7 Figure 2 : Interactive features for generating context - specific messages : ( a ) customizable fea - tures that allow users to describe their individual situation , select the need for specific instruc - tions , choose the tone and directedness of the message , and specify the desired length of the message ; ( b ) a feature enabling open - ended modifications to generated messages ; ( c ) a built - in editor that allows for direct edits to the generated message . situation ] . ” In this query , the final sentence would be excluded if the user had no preference for receiving specific application instructions for their particular situation . This query underwent multiple iterations to achieve its final form . Participants also had the option to make open - ended requests to change the generated message as well as edit the message themselves . Figures 2 ( b ) and 2 ( c ) show how these features were presented , respectively . 3 . 3 Prompting Future Action To foster proactive behavior and facilitate the translation of intentions into tangible actions , we implemented a feature that requested participants to draft an email to their future selves . Drawing on existing literature in the areas of task management and goal - setting [ 2 , 36 , 99 ] , 8 Figure 3 : Features for drafting an email to future self : ( a ) an open - ended text box for drafting the message , ( b ) a feature enabling open - ended modifications to the draft , ( c ) a list of suggested keywords for envisioning the future . this feature aimed to encourage participants to prioritize their responsibilities and establish clear objectives . Our aim was to facilitate reflection at various temporal stages of their goals , from the immediate future to more distant timeframes , thereby enabling incremental action planning . In addition to aiding in the planning process , this feature also prompted participants to consider their underlying motivations and anticipated achievements [ 89 ] . While participants were given the autonomy to draft their future - oriented email indepen - dently , the LLM was available to assist in structuring and refining their thoughts . Participants had the flexibility to make open - ended requests for editing their drafts . They could also utilize specific keywords to conceptualize their future actions more effectively . These keywords were provided to serve as semantic anchors that can help individuals better align their actions with their core values and goals , thereby enhancing the potential for successful implementation [ 35 ] . These features are illustrated in Figure 3 . 3 . 4 Instructions and Examples Throughout the probe , participants were offered instructions and sample inputs for open - ended response boxes . The aim of providing these guidelines was to steer the participants toward 9 relevant and effective suggestions [ 41 , 88 ] . These examples and instructions were also formulated through multiple iterations with involvement from research team members with expertise in cognitive psychology . For instance , when participants were asked to describe a specific situation , as shown in Figure 2 ( a ) , they were given example scenarios that they could follow for writing their own situation . Figures 2 and 3 present the instructions and examples that were shown to the participants . Figure 4 : Prompts to generate personalized messages Additionally , we recognized that some participants might desire greater autonomy in shaping the messages generated by the system , such as specifying the source of the advice or requiring the inclusion of particular elements [ 8 , 20 ] . To accommodate this , we enabled participants to create their own custom prompts . This feature allowed participants to explore how varying the input prompts can lead to diverse message outputs . To assist participants in crafting these prompts , we supplied a set of example templates that they could use as a starting point . These example prompts are displayed in Figure 4 . 4 Methods We involved 15 university students in our study through interviews and focus group discussions and subsequently corroborated our findings through interviews with six experts in clinical psychology , learning and education , and cognitive psychology . The following section provides details on the methodology and logistics that shaped our study . 4 . 1 Participants We recruited 15 individuals for our study through email invitations and social media calls . Participants were required to be between the ages of 18 and 25 , currently enrolled at a university , and residing in North America . Additionally , they had to self - identify as at least average procrastinators , scoring 24 or higher according to the Irrational Procrastination Scale ( IPS ) [ 102 ] . The mean age of our participants is 21 . 6 ± 0 . 6 years old . They identified with two genders ( 10 women , 5 men ; other options were offered ) and several racial groups ( 8 Asian , 4 White , 2 African American , 1 Mixed - Race ) . We refer to these participants as P1 – P15 . To obtain a professional perspective on participant feedback , we also conducted interviews with six experts . We refer to these experts as E1 – E6 . These participants were also recruited from email invitations and social media calls . All of them had post - graduate degrees from diverse fields including clinical psychology ( E1 and E2 ) , learning and education ( E3 – E6 ) , and 10 cognitive psychology ( E4 and E6 ) . They identified with two genders ( 3 women and 3 men ; other options were offered ) and belonged to two racial groups ( 5 White and 1 Asian ) . 4 . 2 Procedure Our research protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Board at the first author’s in - stitution . Recognizing the sensitive nature of our research topic , we anticipated that some participants might be more comfortable sharing their experiences and preferences in a one - on - one setting , while others might find a group discussion more conducive for collaborative idea generation . Therefore , we collected feedback through both individual interviews and focus group discussions . Ten individuals gave individual interviews ( P1 – P10 ) and five took part in a focus group discussion session ( P11 – P15 ) . Two members of the research team organized the interviews and focus groups using the Google Meet videoconferencing platform . Interview durations ranged from 30 to 50 minutes , while the focus group discussion lasted 90 minutes . The interviews and focus groups employed a semi - structured approach to facilitate flexible investigation . After being given access to SPARK through a publicly hosted link , participants were given a brief overview of the study’s objectives and a walkthrough of the tool according to the four main components as detailed in Section 3 . Participants were then instructed to share their screens as they explored SPARK on their own for 10 minutes ; some participants requested and were granted additional time for this part of the protocol ( P1 , P3 , P4 , P6 , P9 , and P10 ) . While this exploration was self - directed , the typical user interaction proceeded as follows : 1 . Participants initially experimented with various versions of the seed messages ( Figure 1 ) . This initial exploration typically lasted between 30 seconds and 2 minutes . 2 . They then explored different interface options as shown in Figures 2 ( a ) and 4 . Participants often sought clarification on the extent of detail required for their inputs , to which we clarified that they were free to provide as little or as much as they wanted . This phase of interaction took 6 to 8 minutes . 3 . The next step involved participants generating personalized messages using SPARK . They either requested further customization from the LLM or modified the messages themselves , as depicted in Figures 2 ( b ) and ( c ) respectively . This step usually spanned 2 to 4 minutes . 4 . Finally , participants engaged with the email drafting activity for future actions ( Figure 3 ) . Six participants composed short emails to be sent within the session’s duration , while others experimented with different features . Participants spent 2 to 4 minutes on this activity . It is important to note that participants sometimes navigated non - linearly between the features of SPARK . Therefore , the times reported here represent the approximate duration for each stage of interaction . Next , participants were invited to give their thoughts on the utility of the tool and potential features they would find beneficial . The focus group session adhered to a similar structure , with the primary difference being that participants in the focus group were given turns to share their opinions . Questions posed in interviews and the focus group included , but were not limited to : • What kinds of interface options or customization features would you like to see in a tool for managing academic procrastination ? • How much effort are you willing to invest in detailing your procrastination issues in an open - ended text box ? 11 • What kinds of resources or guidance might help users effectively personalize messages using LLMs for managing academic procrastination ? • How do you see such tools fitting into your daily routine for managing academic procras - tination ? All participants were compensated with $ 20 USD per hour for their involvement in the study . Following the completion of participant interviews , we applied thematic analysis to extract themes from the interview and focus group transcripts ( Section 4 . 3 ) . We then interviewed the experts to solicit feedback on these findings . These discussions also began with an introduction to the goals of our study and a walkthrough of SPARK , after which we presented a summary of the findings from our thematic analysis . For each theme , our questions for the experts centered around two broad questions : • What are the potential benefits and risks of implementing the features related to this theme ? • What ethical challenges or considerations should be anticipated when implementing these features ? The expert interviews were conducted via Google Meet and had durations ranging from 45 to 60 minutes . 4 . 3 Data Analysis The interviews and focus group discussions yielded approximately 9 . 5 hours of audio recordings , which translated into 172 pages of transcribed data . All personal identifiers were removed from the transcripts to ensure anonymity , and the data was then thoroughly cleaned for analysis . We followed a thematic analysis approach [ 15 , 23 , 77 ] to analyze the collected data . Two team members took on the role of coders and reviewed all data to familiarize themselves . The coders then began the process of assigning specific codes to three interview transcripts using an open - coding approach [ 56 ] . Each coder individually created an initial codebook . We subsequently employed a consensus coding approach akin to the process described by Braun and Clarke [ 15 ] . The coders engaged in multiple collaborative sessions where they com - pared and merged their individual codebooks . This process of consensus coding with iterative discussions and refinement aimed to enhance consistency and reduce individual biases [ 42 , 77 ] . Coders identified overlapping codes , clarified code definitions , and excluded codes not closely aligned with the research questions . The refined codebook was then applied iteratively to three additional transcripts , allowing for further adjustments based on emerging insights . Once a fi - nal version of the codebook 1 was agreed upon , each coder independently applied the established codes to half of the remaining data . Our analysis generated 19 codes , such as “need for direct solutions” , “step - by - step guide - lines” , “use of calendars” , and “clear disclaimers” . The coders arranged multiple meetings to group the codes into broader themes through axial coding [ 118 ] . We organized our findings around the themes that are presented in Section 5 . 4 . 4 Ethical Considerations Given the nature of our research , which touches upon aspects of procrastination , stress manage - ment , and goal setting , we were mindful of the ethical considerations involved . Throughout our 1 The definitions of each code from the final codebook are provided in Appendix A . 12 Table 2 : Breakdown of themes from participant ( P ) and expert ( E ) responses . Themes Codes Number of In - dividuals Men - tioned Aspirations for structured action steps Need for direct solutions 13P + 2E Step - by - step guidelines 10P + 4E Structuring recommenda - tions 10P + 3E Overreliance 2P + 5E Adaptive breakdown 3P + 2E Deadline - driven instructions Reliance on deadlines 12P + 4E Use of calendars 7P + 2E Documenting goals 8P + 5E Need for reminders 7P + 4E Diversity in motivation 2P + 4E Guided versus unguided questions Varied levels of guidance 6P + 5E Providing multiple layers of features 7P + 3E Flexible engagement 3P + 2E Concerns and boundaries in Need for emotional support 9P providing emotional support Limitations of LLMs in ad - dressing emotions 1P + 6E Clear disclaimers 5E Providing support on the use of LLM - based tools Examples and instructions 5P + 4E Collaborative elements 4P + 2E Feedback to LLMs 5P + 1E work , we took measures to address these concerns . To ensure participant comfort and safety , we informed them at the outset of the interviews that they had the option to skip any ques - tions or discontinue the conversation if they felt uncomfortable at any point . Our interviewers were trained in the Columbia - Suicide Risk Assessment protocol [ 17 ] and prepared to respond appropriately if participants expressed thoughts of suicide or self - harm . They were equipped to provide safety planning or make referrals to crisis services as necessary . However , none of these risks emerged during the study . 5 Findings In the following section , we delineate various themes that emerge concerning the ways in which users perceive the utility of LLM - based tools for managing academic procrastination . Addition - ally , we discuss how expert opinions either corroborate or diverge from these user perspectives . Table 2 shows the correspondence between themes and codes as well as the number of partici - pants and experts who mentioned them . 13 5 . 1 Aspirations for Structured Action Steps Participants generally appreciated the flexibility offered by the tool ( e . g . , the ability to select a preferred tone or directedness ) for message customization . They noted that customization not only enhanced the utility of the tool but also gave them a greater sense of control over their interaction . P1 commented : “ I think the tone and the length I’d love to play around with , I’m trying to imagine myself as a user . ChatGPT has a tendency to maintain the same tone in all of its messages . I don’t think I’m going to the effort of putting this information there . But here people can just directly choose what they want to click in to use . ” Participants also raised potential ideas for additional customization features . For example , some vouched for the ability to switch between action - oriented and suggestive tones , and others suggested the ability to enhance instructions with pertinent resources ( e . g . , links to studies or relevant websites ) . P12 stated that sometimes users may express a desire to understand the reasoning behind a step or to explore alternative approaches , so making such resources available could satiate this curiosity and augment user involvement . However , despite these design opportunities identified by participants , some of them also expressed the concern that an excessive number of options might be overwhelming . To address this , P2 suggested a two - tiered approach : presenting basic customization features on the main page and more advanced options on a separate page . Extending this need for customization , participants in our study wished to receive structured guidance from the system to carry out their tasks . Many of them emphasized the challenges they face with unstructured or expansive tasks . The widespread view was that tasks appear more manageable when presented in a clear , step - by - step sequence . P8 drew upon a cooking analogy , referencing their preference for following a recipe versus freestyle cooking without any guidance . Beyond ease of use , participants also identified psychological benefits to seeing a concrete action plan . For instance , P2 noted how users could feel fulfillment upon completing individual steps for larger tasks . Expert insights also underscored the value of offering users assistance in breaking down larger tasks . E1 , however , cautioned that while a comprehensive plan can be constructive , there is a risk of overwhelming students . Their recommendation was to detail the imminent steps while providing a broader outline for later tasks . As users navigate through the initial steps , future steps and details can be introduced . E3 and E6 also raised concerns about fostering over - reliance on the tool . E3 expressed : “ While structured guidance is valuable , we must ensure students retain their ability for independent thought and action . The danger lies in spoon - feeding them precise answers or solutions . It’s crucial for students to develop their own thinking and information - gathering skills . Relying too heavily on a step - by - step model , especially one presented by an LLM , might foster a false sense of accomplishment . Students might follow every instruction and still wonder why their outcomes don’t match their expectations . ” In summary , while structured guidance was seen as vital for task management , experts recommended a balance should be struck to ensure learners’ independence and critical thinking remain intact . 5 . 2 Deadline - Driven Interactions Participants appreciated the tool’s ability to allow them to draft future emails to themselves . This feature was seen as especially beneficial for managing important deadlines . For instance , 14 P10 indicated they would leverage this capability as a way to document their goals , with the periodic emails serving as reminders to review and refocus on these objectives . P2 and P4 further elaborated that the act of drafting these emails would also assist them in gaining better clarity regarding their goals and plans . For better management of deadlines , however , several participants expressed an interest in integrating a tool like ours into their daily workflow for on - the - spot , personalized advice and actionable plans . Participants like P2 and P3 suggested integrations with platforms they already use for professional purposes , such as Google Calendar , Microsoft Teams , and Slack . In this context , a recurrent suggestion was the addition of a feature allowing participants to specify task deadlines . They believed that by doing so , the tool would be better positioned to deliver timely and pertinent recommendations . P2 shared an illustrative perspective : “ I have a friend who will be like , ‘Yeah , you have this coming up , you have that coming up . So you better do this first and do that first and prioritize this because this is more work than others . ’ So the AI can somewhat do something similar where you can be like , ‘You have this coming up . I think you should prioritize this . ’ It’s not like it is telling me to do it . . . . It’s just that , like a gentle reminder or something of that fashion . ” Some participants offered thoughts regarding the optimal frequency and timing of reminders from the tool . For instance , P6 emphasized the importance of receiving motivational cues significantly ahead of an impending deadline to prevent last - minute rushes . They went on to suggest incorporating features that allow users to set task priorities and provide estimates for completion times , tailoring the tool’s reminders to their individual needs . Experts largely agreed with the participants but emphasized the diverse motivational needs people require at different times . E2 suggested multiple strategies to this end : for those who feel regret reflecting on past procrastination , a message like “The past is in the past , focus on today” ; for specific barriers , a response inspired by WOOP ( wish , outcome , obstacle , plan ) goal - setting model [ 82 ] ; and for a lack of perceived purpose , affirmations connecting tasks to future goals or values . Furthermore , E1 posited that presenting an array of motivational prompts could enable users to select the one that resonates most with them . 5 . 3 Guided Versus Unguided Questions In our prototype , participants had the flexibility to elaborate on their situations to whatever extent they desired . Participants embraced this feature as an opportunity for them to mold canned messages to fit their unique context . However , opinions varied when discussing the nature and quantity of questions the tool used to probe users for more information . Some participants advocated for a guided approach featuring a sequence of open - ended questions , believing it would help frame their responses more effectively . P7 illustrated this preference by stating , “ The first problem is ‘What is something you are putting off for today ? ’ And then you would write , ‘I’m putting off x and y’ . And then after you type and press [ the continue button ] , it might prompt you to say , ‘How has that made you feel ? ’ And then it might prompt you to say , ‘What made me feel this way ? ’ . ” Conversely , other participants were concerned that a sequence of questions could serve as a new avenue for procrastination . P2 emphasized the potential to overwhelm users with numerous prompts , especially during initial interactions with the platform . Additionally , building on past experiences with self - management tools , Participant P4 noted that a barrage of questions in 15 the midst of a busy schedule could also heighten stress levels . In scenarios like these , they predicted that users would prefer to receive personalized guidance that is both immediate and easy to access , without the need to navigate through a multitude of questions . To mitigate these concerns , E1 , E3 , and E6 suggested the inclusion of adaptive contextual factors to adjust both the quantity and type of questions posed to the user . They recommended employing contextual variables like the time of day , day of the week , and the user’s schedule to fine - tune how the LLM elicits more information about the user’s situation . While these experts generally supported providing longer interactions informed by psychological literature [ 92 , 97 ] , they also recognized that users should have the option for shorter interactions when experiencing higher levels of activity or stress . 5 . 4 Concerns and Boundaries in Providing Emotional Support The recognition and acknowledgment of user emotions emerged as a significant theme , with diverse opinions shared by both participants and experts . They recognized that discussions of procrastination could often lead to revelations about mental states , including symptoms of anxiety and depression . In such cases , some participants expressed the need for emotional support . P4 said : “ Assuming I already signed up for it , then I might like more emotional support . Like actual links [ saying ] ‘Here are resources that you can use’ . Maybe there will be options [ for showing ] pep talks or something like that . ” Participants like P7 felt that the tool could be proactive in inquiring users about their emotions and the possible culprits behind negative feelings . P11 went further , expressing an interest in having access to resources for managing more serious and vulnerable issues such as depression . Nevertheless , experts advised caution regarding the prospect of LLMs taking on roles akin to therapists for providing support in the management of emotions . Their concern stemmed from the possibility that these models could dispense advice that , while perhaps appealing to users , may lack clinical validity . Instead , experts like E1 , E4 , and E5 emphasized that the tools should only simply recognize users’ emotions while clearly communicating their limitations in providing therapeutic support . E3 said : “ First , acknowledge that the individual is struggling . You know , thank them for the description kind of thing . . . . Just say this , ‘This kind of falls out of the scope of what I am able to assist you with’ . ” E5 elaborated on the need for transparency regarding the tool’s limitations , emphasizing that users should be clearly informed from the outset about the tool’s capabilities and constraints . This includes an explicit declaration at the introduction page outlining the tool’s capacities and the message that any unintentional suggestion regarding emotion management should not be acted upon by users . They further stated that the system should contain contact information for university support services or crisis management centers for further assistance and support . 5 . 5 Providing Support on the Use of LLM - based Tools Although LLMs are meant to be conversational and intuitive , participants in our study still desired guidance on how to best phrase their responses to get the tool to behave as they anticipated . Some felt that video tutorials and demonstrations might be useful , but there were stronger calls for concrete examples of inputs and outputs . P6 noted that the example prompts in Figure 4 helped them learn about the kinds of requests they could make and showed the range 16 of possible outputs they could expect . Extending on this idea further , participants proposed the idea of adding a collaborative element so that users could help one another optimally use the tool . P2 expanded on this concept by saying : “ Maybe share with me what other people are saying as well . So yeah , make it more like a social thing . I would also want to see what other people are asking for in their messages . ” Participants also expressed an interest in providing feedback on the advice generated by the tool so that it would work better for them in the future . Again , they were unsure about how this could be accomplished , so they sought instructions and concrete examples that could assist them in this aspect as well . P2 and P9 went on to suggest that such tools should offer users ways of providing feedback beyond inputs to the LLM . For instance , they envisioned a star - rating system that allows users to evaluate tailored advice on perceived qualities such as relevance , applicability , and level of detail . Experts concurred with the participants’ suggestions , adding an extra layer of caution . E5 stressed that tools need to explicitly distinguish the contexts in which they can be helpful from those in which they cannot . Accordingly , the examples provided to users should be designed to make this distinction abundantly clear so that users are fully aware of the tool’s capabilities and limitations . 6 Discussion In our discussion , we reflect on how our findings answer our research questions and then use those insights to generate design recommendations for LLM - based tools for managing academic procrastination . We then highlight our works’ contributions to the broader literature on human - LLM collaboration . Finally , we enumerate the limitations of our study along with avenues for future research . 6 . 1 RQ1 : Users’ Envisioning of LLMs in Tailoring Strategies for Managing Academic Procrastination 6 . 1 . 1 Structured Guidance with Adaptability In alignment with existing literature on procrastination management and structured goal - setting [ 16 , 26 , 36 , 44 , 64 , 89 ] , our study reiterates the importance of breaking down larger tasks into more manageable components . LLMs emerge as particularly adept for this purpose , offering the capability to provide detailed , actionable steps for immediate tasks while also de - livering overarching , abstract guidelines for long - term objectives [ 71 , 79 ] . This dual approach of LLMs caters to both immediate task execution and longer - term goal planning . Design Recommendations : Future procrastination management tools should strive to achieve a balance between providing structured guidance and maintaining adaptability . Ensuring that tools are both systematic in their approach to task management and flexible enough to adapt to individual user requirements could support users in a wide range of contexts [ 12 , 30 , 55 , 68 , 70 ] . For LLM - based tools specifically , an important feature could be the development of a dynamic structured guidance system , which would generate hierarchical task lists dynamically based on user input [ 71 , 79 , 83 ] . Including functionality to automatically break down large tasks into manageable micro - tasks with clear deadlines would further enhance this system . Such a feature would not only provide structured task management but also adapt to the specific needs of each 17 user . To enhance user engagement and provide comprehensive support , the system could also offer supplemental resources that are tailored to each specific task [ 95 ] . 6 . 1 . 2 Integration with User Routines and Deadlines Participants in our study highlighted the necessity for deadline - oriented interactions facilitated by LLMs as a means of seamlessly integrating into their daily academic activities . However , it is important to acknowledge the individual variations in perceived effort related to both the target task and other concurrent responsibilities . This aspect of our findings enhances and broadens the scope of existing literature , which underscores that effective deadline management should encompass more than just scheduling ; it needs to take into account the comprehensive context of a user’s life [ 5 , 31 , 46 , 76 , 121 , 123 ] . Building on this , our research advocates for a dynamic approach to task prioritization , one that is attuned to the urgency of deadlines while being sensitive to the individual’s overall workload and personal commitments . Design Recommendations : Future procrastination management tools could benefit from synchronization with commonly used platforms such as Google Calendar , Microsoft Teams , and Slack . This integration would facilitate the automatic import of scheduled tasks and deadlines , thereby aiding in task organization [ 26 , 36 , 43 ] . Additionally , integrating mobile phone sensor data could provide further information about users’ activity levels and sleep patterns , potentially enhancing the relevance of task management suggestions [ 27 , 93 ] . Based on this imported information and any user - inputted priorities , LLM - based tools could then dynamically generate a ranked task list . These tools could also include a effort estimator to allow users to adjust task rankings based on their estimated completion time and task difficulty [ 2 ] . 6 . 1 . 3 Collaborative Support in Using LLM - based Tools Participants of our study expressed interest in learning from others’ examples to both navigate our LLM - based tool and to learn about effective strategies for combating procrastination . This reflects the broader psychological need for collaborative support in combating procrastination [ 18 , 45 , 108 , 110 ] . Implementing such collaborative support features could aid users in navigat - ing the complexities of interacting with the LLM - based tool and offer them guidelines or best practices through the experiences of others [ 11 ] . Design Recommendations : Future procrastination management tools could provide users with a communal repository where they could access a variety of strategies and solutions that have been effective in managing tasks and deadlines , bearing in mind that user contributions would need to be thoroughly de - identified to respect people’s privacy [ 104 ] . Specifically for LLM - based tools , this concept could be further developed into a shared prompt library where users could view and contribute diverse examples of prompts and the corresponding responses generated by the LLM . This feature would be particularly useful as it would allow users to ex - plore the range of the tool’s capabilities , providing insights into how to interact more effectively with it . Furthermore , allowing users to rate the utility , relevance , and clarity of the LLM’s re - sponses in the communal repository could provide an effective means for users to identify the examples that best suit their needs . 18 6 . 2 RQ2 : Potential Limitations and Tensions 6 . 2 . 1 Boundaries in Addressing Emotions Our study sheds light on the limitations of LLMs in the realm of procrastination management , particularly concerning emotional and therapeutic support . These findings align with recent skepticism among clinicians regarding the suitability of LLMs for emotional counseling and therapeutic support [ 52 , 54 , 79 ] . While LLMs inherently lack the ability to discern human emotions , they might encounter user - expressed emotions in written form . The experts con - sulted in our study underscored the need for LLM - based tools to acknowledge and validate these emotions without crossing into the territory of clinical or therapeutic advice [ 52 ] . Their comments reinforce the importance of carefully defining the scope and limitations of LLM - based tools in managing tasks and emotions , ensuring their responsible and effective use . Design Recommendations : Future procrastination management tools should prominently feature a detailed disclaimer on the landing page to ensure clarity and responsible usage [ 11 , 12 ] . This disclaimer should concisely state the purpose and limitations of the tool , particularly in relation to emotional and psychological support . In the context of LLM - based tools , disclaimers should highlight that while they can assist with procrastination management strategies like scheduling or time management , they are not equipped to provide therapeutic support [ 32 , 63 ] . For users who might require specialized emotional or psychological assistance , the system should provide a place where users can access a vetted list of well - established resources for mental health support : informational websites , helpline numbers , or links to accredited mental health service providers [ 11 , 12 ] . 6 . 2 . 2 Balancing Guidance and Independent Exploration The expert interviewees expressed concerns about the potential for students to become over - reliant on LLM - based tools [ 50 , 54 , 79 ] . They warned that easy access to a tool that breaks down complex tasks might inhibit the development of independent problem - solving skills . This aligns with recent literature that emphasizes the need for a balance between providing guided assistance and fostering independent problem - solving skills [ 1 , 104 ] . Design Recommendations : Future procrastination management tools may occasionally re - strict users’ access to functionalities that produce direct step - by - step solutions and instead prompt them to independently seek out potential strategies [ 22 , 59 ] . These restrictions could be strategically timed , for instance , after a user completes a certain number of sub - tasks or reaches key milestones in a project . LLM - based tools could go a step further by generating independent exploration prompts ( e . g . , “research further” , “think critically” ) that encourage problem - solving strategies [ 51 , 73 ] . Each option could come with a brief description of what the activity entails and why it might be beneficial , providing a nudge without forcing a spe - cific course of action [ 9 ] . Users could also have the option to schedule independent exploration prompts at intervals of their choosing , offering customization to better suit individual work habits and needs [ 9 ] . 6 . 2 . 3 Allowing Flexible Engagement We recognize a design tension regarding the extent of guidance users may wish to see when describing their situation . In some instances , users may prefer a set of structured questions to shape their responses , which may be more feasible during idle periods and moments of downtime [ 12 , 90 ] . Conversely , a single open - ended question could be more suitable when users are initially acquainting themselves with the system or are in the midst of many other activities 19 [ 62 ] . The same contextual variability applies to the level of customization available in the tool , whether it be related to the tone , directedness , or length of the advice given [ 6 , 34 , 75 ] . While these features may be beneficial , there are moments when the user may not have the bandwidth to engage with such granularity and would prefer the option to bypass these decisions to avoid overwhelm [ 12 ] . Design Recommendations : Our findings highlight the need for procrastination management tools that permit flexible engagement , allowing users to maintain a minimal level of interaction even when they are not fully engaged . Studies in educational psychology and social media behaviors indicate that different online activities demand various levels of cognitive involvement [ 12 , 19 , 39 , 113 ] . While active engagement is typically more beneficial for enhancing learning and wellbeing , our findings suggest that there are times when users may be reluctant to invest significant cognitive effort , particularly during periods of low energy or mood [ 12 ] . In such instances , LLM - based tools should allow users to access key functionalities without demanding intensive engagement . While our findings are situated within the use of an LLM - based probe , this need for flexible engagement could apply to general procrastination management tools as well . 6 . 3 Contributions to Human - LLM Collaboration Our findings , although mainly situated within the context of managing academic procrastina - tion , contribute to the evolving body of literature on human - LLM collaboration . This study highlights the nuanced ways in which users engage with LLM - based tools , underscoring the potential for these models to offer more than just information processing ; they can act as col - laborative partners in personal and academic development [ 21 , 29 , 38 , 57 , 65 ] . The desire for structured action steps and deadline - driven interactions aligns with the broader understand - ing of how individuals seek both assistance and partnership in managing their tasks . This perspective is bolstered by recent studies showing the promise of LLMs in exhibiting social intelligence and human - like collaborative behaviors [ 38 , 86 , 98 , 125 ] . With this paradigm shift in AI that is moving towards systems that are capable of complex and empathetic interactions , there is a need to understand the unique contexts of individual users in order to enhance their downstream utility . The varied opinions on structured questioning and the concerns raised about emotional sup - port challenges resonate with ongoing discussions about the ethical and practical implications of human - LLM interactions [ 52 , 100 , 104 ] . Our findings suggest that while users appreciate the personalized assistance offered by LLMs , they also value retaining a degree of autonomy and control over the interaction . This balance between guidance and independence could be a critical aspect of designing effective LLM - based tools , as it may directly impact user engage - ment and satisfaction [ 10 ] . Moreover , the caution advised by experts about the role of LLMs in emotional support and the need for transparency in their capabilities reflects a growing awareness of the ethical responsibilities inherent in deploying AI in sensitive areas like mental health [ 52 , 54 , 79 ] . The ethical implications of AI tools offering mental health support are complex , particularly given the risk of users relying on these tools for serious mental health issues without professional guidance [ 54 ] . Our study contributes to the broader discourse on the ethical deployment of AI in sensitive domains , advocating for a cautious , well - informed approach that prioritizes user safety and wellbeing while exploring the beneficial aspects of human - LLM collaboration . 20 6 . 4 Limitations and Future Works In acknowledging the limitations of our research , we first note that our participant group was composed of individuals residing in North America at the time of the study . Although this co - hort included people from various racial groups , the geographical and cultural context in which they live may have influenced their perspectives on the use of LLM - based tools for managing procrastination . Future studies should aim to include a more geographically and culturally diverse participant group . Engaging with populations from different regions and cultural back - grounds would provide a broader perspective on the use of LLM - based tools for managing procrastination , potentially uncovering unique challenges , preferences , and expectations . Additionally , we designed a technology probe to explore user expectations regarding LLM - based tools for managing academic procrastination . To mitigate academic and emotional risks that could arise from deploying an unvalidated tool , we chose not to conduct a longitudinal study without researcher oversight . Nevertheless , we recognize the potential benefits of long - term studies for a more comprehensive understanding of the real - world effectiveness and long - term implications of LLM - based tools in this context . With appropriate researcher oversight and ethical considerations , future studies could entail longitudinal deployments that examine the impact of various features on acceptability and perceived effectiveness . Finally , our findings are situated in the domain of academic procrastination management and , therefore , might not directly translate to other behavioral or psychological areas . Future research could broaden its scope to assess the efficacy of LLM - based tools in tackling a diverse array of challenges . Such exploration could range from addressing mental health concerns to enhancing personal productivity or promoting healthy behaviors . Investigating the application of these tools in varied scenarios will provide a deeper understanding of their adaptability and constraints , enriching the knowledge base about the full potential of LLM - based tools in different contexts . 7 Conclusion Traditional interventions often fail to capture the unique , person - specific factors that contribute to academic procrastination . LLMs offer a promising avenue to bridge this gap , as they allow for open - ended , individualized responses through sophisticated data analysis and natural language processing capabilities . Yet , the expectations and constraints of employing LLMs for this purpose have not been thoroughly investigated . To fill this knowledge void , we conducted in - depth interviews and focus group discussions with 15 university students and consulted six experts , using a technology probe for context . Our findings underscore the need for LLM - based tools to offer structured guidance with a focus on deadlines and to include enhanced mechanisms for user support . The results also emphasize the importance of adaptability in the query process , taking into account factors such as the individual’s level of busyness , and advocate for caution when considering the use of LLMs for therapeutic advice . These insights enabled us to make several design recommendations surrounding structured guidance with adaptive complexity , boundaries in addressing user emotions , and collaborative support in using LLMs . We believe our findings and recommendations will serve as important guidelines for developers , UX / UI designers , and researchers working on LLM - based intervention tools .
