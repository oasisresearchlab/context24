2157 Vol . 73 , No . 11 , November 2023 Open Access Introduction In December 2019 , the city of Wuhan in China witnessed a rise in patients with mild pneumonia the aetiology of which remained unknown . Upon closer inspection , the symptoms of the aﬄicted patients were attributed to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) . 1 The spike in cases at the time signalled an epidemic , which rapidly progressed to a global pandemic spanning aﬀecting all countries across the globe . 2 According to global data , as of February , 2022 , SARS - CoV - 2 had aﬀected 414 , 018 , 063 individuals across the world , out of whom 5 , 845 , 051 had died . In Pakistan , 1 , 488 , 958 people were aﬀected , and 29 , 828 had died . 3 The spread of the virus was due to close contact with an infected person , and could enter the human body and subsequently the lungs through inhalation of respiratory droplets or direct contact . 4 Since its onset , coronavirus disease - 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) posed a massive challenge . 5 Although vaccines were eﬀective in reducing hospitalisations and fatality in patients with COVID - 19 , the recommended key strategy for controlling the spread remained diligent isolation and quarantine . According to the guidelines issued by the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) , practising good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette , maintaining social distancing , avoiding contact with eyes , nose and mouth , and self - isolation were the key measures of controlling the spread . 6 While most of the above - mentioned recommendations helped reduce the risk of getting infected on a personal level , self - isolation could lead to broad - scale benefits . Isolation is defined as the separation of an infected individual for a minimum of 14 days , after which the infection likely clears 7 although updated guidelines from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) recommended a shortened isolation period of 5 days . 8 This helped avoid close contact with the non - infected population , thereby limiting transmission . This was in concordance with the lessons learned from the previous SARS outbreak , which suggested that self - isolation could lead to a reduced spread of infection . 9 However , Feng et al . 10 reported that home - isolation was associated with a high risk of transmission to household members . Therefore , it was essential for COVID - 19 - positive individuals to strictly follow guidelines related to home - isolation . As the number of cases continued to rise , Pakistan faced a shortage of hospital beds , and , therefore , mild / RESEARCH ARTICLE Home Isolated COVID - 19 patients adhering to recommended guidelines : A cross sectional survey in Karachi Shobha Luxmi 1 , Munazza Obaid 2 , Sadaf Zia 3 , Fatima Zulfiqar Siddiqui 4 , Musfirah Danyal Barry 5 , Saba Zaheer 6 , Faiza Zakaria 7 Abstract Objective : To assess compliance level of coronavirus disease - 2019 patients with recommended isolation guidelines . Methods : The cross - sectional phone - based survey was conducted in Karachi , from March to October 2020 after approval from the ethics review board of Dow University of Health Sciences , Karachi , and comprised patients of either gender who had been tested positive and were advised home isolation due to mild / asymptomatic nature of their infection . Data was collected using a predesigned 42 - item questionnaire in the light of the guidelines issued by the National Institutes of Health , Islamabad , Pakistan . Data was analysed using SPSS 20 . Results : Of the 450 patients approached , 305 ( 68 % ) responded ; 176 ( 57 . 7 % ) females and 129 ( 41 . 1 % ) males . The overall mean age was 35 . 16±14 . 15 years ( range : 13 - 78 years ) . Of the total , 9 ( 2 . 95 % ) patients did not isolate themselves at all , 51 ( 16 . 7 % ) came into contact with other people , 75 ( 24 . 6 % ) broke the home isolation and 69 ( 22 . 6 % ) were sharing their rooms with other family members . Overall , 260 ( 85 . 2 % ) participants were keeping themselves updated with the changes in the guidelines through conventional and social media . Conclusion : Coronavirus disease - 2019 patients who were advised home isolation adhered to some but not all of the recommendations .

Zia , et al . asymptomatic COVID - 19 patients were advised to home - isolate . The government of Pakistan , through the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , published home - isolation guidelines for both the patient and the family members to help avoid transmission . 11 There is a lack of data on home - isolation practices of COVID - 19 patients in Pakistan . The current study was planned to fill the gap by investigating the extent to which recommended guidelines were followed . Subjects and Methods The cross - sectional phone - based survey was conducted in Karachi , from March to October 2020 after approval from the ethics review board of Dow University of Health Sciences ( DUHS ) , Karachi . The sample size was calculated in line with a study in Japan which showed the prevalence of adoption of personal protective measures by ordinary citizens during the pandemic as 34 . 7 % . 11 OpenEpi 3 . 01 12 was used to calculate the sample size with 95 % confidence level and 5 % margin of error . The sample was inflated by 10 % for expected non - response rate . The sample was raised using convenience sampling technique from among those who visited DUHS COVID - 19 clinic . Those included were patients of either gender who tested positive for COVID - 19 through a nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , and were subsequently advised home isolation due to mild / asymptomatic nature of their infection . Patients who tested positive for COVID - 19 and had moderate to severe symptoms were excluded , and so were those who were admitted to hospital and those who were not willing to participate . The data - collection tool was a 42 - item questionnaire that was compiled from diﬀerent studies and verified recommended guidelines 11 , 12 to assess if the patients were compliant with NIH recommendations . To assess the validity of the instrument , it was revised by a panel of 4 medical doctors . The expert opinions were rated on a scale of 4 - 1 ; where 4 = " strongly relevant " , 3 = " relevant " , 2 = " little relevant " , and 1 = " not relevant " . The questionnaire had 2 sections . Cronbach ' s alpha value for section A was 0 . 762 , and it was 0 . 876 for the section B . Section A comprised socio - demographic variables , such as age , gender , education , occupation , number of family members living under the same roof etc . Section B explored the adherence to recommendations for home - isolation . The items were scored on a 4 - point Likert scale , ranging from “always” to “never” . In addition , the participants were questioned about the symptoms and the availability of necessary supplies required during isolation . The participants were also asked if they were the first to acquire the infection in their household , and if new cases were identified in their home after they started home - isolation . Due to social distancing measure in force at the time , data was collected using Google Forms and direct phone calls . Training was provided to the data collectors , and the questionnaire was piloted on 30 subjects to evaluate the survey’s clarity , organisation , applicability , and filling time . This also addressed any mistakes or carelessness . The questionnaire was modified in the light of the issues raised during the pilot study . Data was collected after taking informed consent from the participants . Data was analysed using SPSS 20 . Descriptive statistics were used for quantitative variables , and frequencies and percentages for qualitative data . A knowledge score of 70 % was taken as adequate . Chi - square test was used to compare variables . The level of significance was set at p < 0 . 05 . Results Of the 450 patients approached , 305 ( 68 % ) responded ; 176 ( 57 . 7 % ) females and 129 ( 41 . 1 % ) males . The overall mean age was 35 . 16±14 . 15 years ( range : 13 - 78 years ) . Most of the participants were educated , with 11 ( 3 . 6 % ) having primary , 21 ( 7 % ) matriculate , 29 ( 9 . 5 % ) intermediate , 175 ( 57 . 4 % ) graduate and 69 ( 22 . 6 % ) having postgraduate qualification . Of the total , 40 ( 13 . 1 % ) were the only bread - winners of their households , 2 ( 0 . 7 % ) had a one - room living space , 96 ( 31 . 5 % ) having three - room , 63 ( 20 . 7 % ) having four - room spaces , and 139 ( 47 . 1 % ) were living in houses that more than four rooms . Among the sole bread - winners , 11 ( 3 . 6 % ) had to leave home - isolation due to financial constraints ( p < 0 . 01 ) . The most common presenting symptom was fever 201 ( 65 . 6 % ) and the least common was diarrhoea 55 ( 18 % ) ( Table 1 ) .

Of the total , 9 ( 2 . 95 % ) patients did not isolate themselves at all , 51 ( 16 . 7 % ) came into contact with other people , 75 ( 24 . 6 % ) broke the home - isolation and 69 ( 22 . 6 % ) were sharing their rooms with other family members . Besides , 160 ( 52 . 4 % ) subjects were the first ones in their families to be infected , and 116 ( 38 % ) of them had other family members getting infected after them ( p < 0 . 01 ) . When asked about their contact with their respective doctors , 87 ( 29 % ) subjects said in person , 43 ( 14 . 1 % ) online , and 23 ( 7 . 5 % ) on a phone call . Also , in 152 ( 49 . 8 % ) cases , olfactory sense came back within 1 - 4 weeks , while 138 ( 45 . 2 % ) participants continued to suﬀer in this regard after 4 weeks of follow - up . Most participants 260 ( 85 . 2 % ) were keeping themselves updated with the changes in the guideline with the help of television 180 ( 59 . 1 % ) , social media 242 ( 79 . 3 % ) , newspapers 94 ( 30 . 7 % ) and websites 210 ( 68 . 8 % ) . Of the 10 questions related to knowledge and understanding of the recommendations , the participants scored > 70 % in 5 ( 50 % ) areas ( Table 3 ) . Discussion The study revealed that 3 % of the participants refused to self - isolate entirely , whereas the rest of the participants isolated at home , with a significant number of individuals not adhering properly to the guidelines . Substantiating this statement , 24 . 6 % of the participants left their homes despite being under home - isolation . A study in Wuhan demonstrated that 100 % of the participants refrained from leaving their homes . 13 However , this may be attributed to their financial stability and stringent government policies . A study conducted in Israel revealed a compliance rate of 94 % when compensation was given , in contrast to a drop of 40 % in compliance rate without monetary compensation . 14 In the current study , 14 % participants were the sole bread - winners of the family , and yet , only 3 . 6 % left their homes due to financial constraints . This gives weight to the notion that adherence to home - isolation guidelines could be improved if financial support is oﬀered by the government . A secondary finding was the spread of COVID - 19 within household members , with a significant fraction of 38 % family members contracting the virus from self - isolated participants in the current study . More than half the subjects were the first in their families to contract the virus . Surprisingly , in one study in New York , an exact 38 % of household contacts tested positive for COVID - 19 after the first reported case . 15 Similar secondary infection rates have Table - 3 : Knowledge of the patients about recommended guidelines .

This perspective can be corroborated by a study conducted in Wuhan whose results showed the success of institution - based isolation over home - isolation with respect to disease transmission . 18 The current study has a few notable limitations as it opted for subjective collection of data from individuals over the phone . Participants may have altered their responses to avoid repercussions they thought might arise from improper adherence to guidelines . Additionally , they may not recall accurate information of when they had isolated , leading to some doubt on the credibility of their responses . Conclusion Majority of people who were advised home - isolation in mild COVID - 19 did not practise isolation completely and had interaction with other family members which was the main reason for the spread of the virus . The economic conditions were another hinderance in the way of home - isolation . Disclaimer : None . Conflict of Interest : None . Source of Funding : None . References 1 .
