S U T L I FF / S C I E N C E BACKGROUND : Because of their differentiation potential , pluripotent stem cells can gener - ate virtually any cell type and , as such , can be used to model de - velopment and disease and even hold the promise of providing cell - replacement therapies . Recently , struc - tures resembling whole organs , termed or - ganoids , have been generated from stem cells through the development of three - dimensional culture systems . Organoids are derived from pluripotent stem cells or isolated organ progenitors that differentiate to form an organlike tissue exhibiting multiple cell types that self - organize to form a structure not unlike the organ in vivo . This technology builds upon a foundation of stem cell technolo - gies , as well as classical developmental bi - ology and cell - mixing experiments . These studies illustrated two key events in struc - tural organization during organogenesis : cell sorting out and spatially restricted lineage commitment . Both of these pro - cesses are recapitulated in organoids , which self - assemble to form the cellular organization of the organ itself . ADVANCES : Organoids have been gener - ated for a number of organs from both mouse and human stem cells . To date , human pluripotent stem cells have been coaxed to generate intestinal , kidney , brain , and retinal organoids , as well as liver or - ganoid - like tissues called liver buds . Deriva - tion methods are specific to each of these systems , with a focus on recapitulation of endogenous developmental processes . These complex structures provide a unique opportunity to model human organ development in a system remarkably simi - lar to development in vivo . Although the full extent of similarity in many cases still remains to be determined , organoids are al - ready being applied to human - specific bio - logical questions . Indeed , brain and retinal organoids have both been shown to exhibit properties that recapitulate human organ development and that cannot be observed in animal models . Naturally , limitations exist , such as the lack of blood supply , but future endeavors will advance the technol - ogy and , it is hoped , fully overcome these technical hurdles . OUTLOOK : The therapeutic promise of or - ganoids is perhaps the area with greatest potential . These unique tissues have the potential to model developmental disease , degenerative conditions , and cancer . Genetic disorders can be modeled by making use of patient - derived induced pluripotent stem cells or by introducing disease mutations . In - deed , this type of approach has already been taken to generate organoids from patient stem cells for intestine , kidney , and brain . Furthermore , organoids that model disease can be used as an alternative sys - tem for drug testing that may not only better recapitulate effects in human pa - tients but could also cut down on animal studies . Liver organoids , in particular , represent a system with high expecta - tions , particularly for drug testing , because of the unique meta - bolic profile of the human liver . Finally , tissues derived in vi - tro could be generated from patient cells to provide alternative or - gan replacement strategies . Unlike current organ transplant treatments , such autolo - gous tissues would not suffer from issues of immunocompetency and rejection . ■ Organogenesis in a dish : Modeling development and disease using organoid technologies ORGANOID GENERATION Madeline A .

Organoids can be derived for a number of organs from human pluripotent stem cells ( PSCs ) . Like organogenesis in vivo , organoids self - organize through both cell sorting out and spatially restricted lineage commitment of pre - cursor cells .

Lancaster 1 and Juergen A . Knoblich 1 * Classical experiments performed half a century ago demonstrated the immense self - organizing capacity of vertebrate cells . Even after complete dissociation , cells can reaggregate and reconstruct the original architecture of an organ . More recently , this outstanding feature was used to rebuild organ parts or even complete organs from tissue or embryonic stem cells . Such stem cell – derived three - dimensional cultures are called organoids . Because organoids can be grown from human stem cells and from patient - derived induced pluripotent stem cells , they have the potential to model human development and disease . Furthermore , they have potential for drug testing and even future organ replacement strategies . Here , we summarize this rapidly evolving field and outline the potential of organoid technology for future biomedical research . S tem cell technologies hold promise for modeling development , analyzing disease mechanisms , and developing potential ther - apies . Until quite recently , most stem cell methods focused on pure populations of particular stem cell – derived cell types ( 1 ) , rather than the complete set of cell types of an organ . However , this is beginning to change with the development of three - dimensional ( 3D ) cultures of developing tissues , called organoids . As organoid technology is on the verge of be - coming an independent research field , a precise definition of the term becomes increasingly im - portant . The term organoid , simply defined as re - sembling an organ , has been used quite loosely for a variety of structures , both in vitro and in vivo ( 2 – 4 ) . The basic definition , however , implies sev - eral important features that are characteristics of organs ( Box 1 ) . First , it must contain more than one cell type of the organ it models ; second , it should exhibit some function specific to that organ ; and third , the cells should be organized similarly to the organ itself . This also implies similarity to the manner in which the organ establishes its characteristic organization during development . Thus , we would like to define an organoid as con - taining several cell types that develop from stem cells or organ progenitors and self - organize through cell sorting and spatially restricted lineage commit - ment , similar to the process in vivo ( Box 1 ) . Self - organization : The foundation of organoid formation Organoid methods build upon an extensive foundation of classic developmental biology and cell dissociation and reaggregation exper - iments ( Fig . 1A ) . Two distinct approaches have been taken to understanding tissue patterning ( 5 ) . In vivo examination of cell movements has revealed mechanisms of cell segregation into discrete domains during tissue morphogenesis ( 6 ) . This process has been extensively examined in , for example , the Drosophila wing disc where the anterior - posterior boundary is established through mutually repressive interactions ( 7 ) . A similar process occurs during vertebrate embry - onic development at the midbrain - hindbrain boundary , which then acts as an organizer for subsequent tissue morphogenesis ( 8 ) . The second approach to understanding tissue patterning has been dissociation and reaggre - gation of tissues to examine relative morphoge - netic movements of cells in vitro ( Fig . 2A ) . This approach has been applied to virtually all de - veloping vertebrate organs in a number of classic studies with embryonic chick tissues ( 9 , 10 ) ( Fig . 1A ) . The results point to a general capacity of cells to reorganize and segregate in a process termed “ cell sorting out ” to form structures with much the same histogenic properties as those in vivo ( 6 , 11 ) . For example , studies from the early 1960s have utilized dissociated cells from the developing chick kidney ( 9 ) to form reaggre - gates that recapitulate virtually complete renal development . The basis of this organ self - assembly seems to arise from segregation of cells with similar ad - hesive properties into domains that achieve the most thermodynamically stable pattern ( Fig . 2A ) . Known as Steinberg ’ s differential adhesion hy - pothesis ( 12 ) ( Fig . 1A ) , the theory is supported by a range of in vitro cell - mixing experiments ( 13 ) . Differential adhesion is mediated by cell surface adhesion proteins , for example , in sepa - ration of vertebrate neural and epidermal ecto - derm ( 14 , 15 ) , where differential epithelial and neural and cadherin expression mediates cell sorting out . A second mechanism that can influence tis - sue morphogenesis is proper spatially restricted progenitor fate decisions ( Fig . 2B ) . An excellent example is the developing vertebrate retina , where neuroepithelial cells give rise to a complex lineage that generates the various layers of the retina in a temporally and spatially restricted manner .

This implies : 1 . Multiple organ - specific cell types 2 . Capable of recapitulating some specific function of the organ ( eg . excretion , filtration , neural activity , contraction ) 3 . Grouped together and spatially organized similar to an organ Organoid formation recapitulates both major processes of self - organization during development : cell sorting out and spatially restricted lineage commitment Definition : A collection of organ - specific cell types that develops from stem cells or organ progenitors and self - organizes through cell sorting and spatially restricted lineage commitment in a manner similar to in vivo . This stratification depends upon proper stem cell division orientation , the interplay of sym - metric and asymmetric divisions , and migration of differentiated daughter cells to defined lo - cations within the tissue ( 16 , 17 ) . Remarkably , this organization can also be recapitulated upon in vitro dissociation and reaggregation ( 18 ) but only when retinal precursor cells are taken from a chick younger than embryonic day 6 ( E6 ) ( 19 , 20 ) . This suggests that retinal layering depends not only on cell sorting out but also proper execu - tion of lineage decisions by retinal progenitors . The combination of both sorting out and fate specification in governing self - organization is particularly evident in tumors called teratomas . Teratomas develop from pluripotent stem cells ( PSCs ) of the germ line and therefore display a variety of organized tissues ( Fig . 1B ) . These in - clude epidermis , nervous tissue , gut , and bone , as well as eyes ( 21 ) and limbs ( 22 ) . The sponta - neous development of these tissues from PSCs is presumably because of a recapitulation of both cell segregation and fate specification . Similarly , these two processes allow for the self - organization seen in organoids ( Box 1 ) . In many ways , organoids represent the meth - odological evolution of an in vitro system called an embryoid body ( EB ) that is similar to an early teratoma ( Fig . 1B ) . EBs are 3D aggregates of PSCs ( 23 ) that undergo initial developmental specification in much the same manner as the pregastrulating embryo ( 24 ) . EBs can further differentiate to form various organized tissues , much like a teratoma . However , their growth in vitro allows for the application of patterning factors to drive particular identities . Not all or - ganoid methods make use of an initial EB stage , but they all involve exogenous tissue patterning and eventually reaggregation to form a 3D self - organized tissue , an organoid . Self - organization is possible in organoids be - cause of a growing movement away from two - dimensional culture . This movement was triggered by the discovery that epithelial cells , such as kid - ney ( 25 ) or breast epithelia ( 26 ) , could develop tubules and ducts when embedded in extracel - lular matrix hydrogels . Similarly , organoids often make use of such gels , particularly the laminin - rich extracellular matrix secreted by the Engelbreth - Holm - Swarm tumor line ( 27 ) , also called Matrigel . The resulting self - organizing structures exhib - it typical tissue architecture , but note that they are highly heterogeneous . Thus , each organoid 1247125 - 2 18 JULY 2014 (cid:127) VOL 345 ISSUE 6194 sciencemag . org SCIENCE 1944 1907 1960 1964 2013 1961 1981 1998 2009 2012 2011 2014 2008 B Pluripotent stem cells Teratoma Embryoid body Organoid A 1987 Wilson demonstrates the potential of dissociated sponge cells to self - organize to regenerate a whole organism ( 120 ) .

( A ) Key events in the history leading up to various organoid methodologies . ( B ) Comparison of para - digms of self - organization from pluripotent stem cells . Teratomas develop various tissues in vivo , either as spontaneous tumors that can arise in animals and humans or from injected PSCs in a rodent host . Embryoid bodies are 3D aggregates of stem cells that self - organize to develop tissues , similar to teratomas in many ways , but formed in vitro . Organoids are similarly 3D in vitro – derived tissues but are driven using specific conditions to generate individual , isolated tissues . RESEARCH | REVIEW is unique and exhibits relative positioning of tissue regions that are often random , possibly because of a lack of embryonic axis formation . For example , brain organoids display various brain regions that individually develop quite similarly to those in vivo ( 28 ) but are not reliably organized relative to one another because of a lack of anterior - posterior and dorsal - ventral axes . Similarly , kidney organoids develop tubules corresponding to regions of the nephron segment ( 29 ) , but they are randomly positioned rather than displaying medul - lary and cortical organization . This heterogeneity makes it difficult to generate pure populations of single cell types , but it can be a powerful tool for modeling development and disease on a whole - organ scale . Current organoid technologies Organoids derived from human PSCs have so far been established for gut , kidney , brain , and retina , among others ( Fig . 3 ) . Many of the organs studied had already been demonstrated to self - organize in reaggregation experiments from embryonic tis - sues ( Table 1 ) , which suggests that organoids could , in principle , be generated if organ progen - itors could be derived from PSCs . Below , we will describe the evolution of each of these organoid approaches from this developmental foundation . Gut organoids The gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract develops primarily from the endoderm ( 6 ) , which forms an epithe - lial tube that develops into three distinct por - tions , the foregut , midgut , and hindgut ( 30 ) . The foregut gives rise to the oral cavity , the pharynx , the respiratory tract , the stomach , the pancreas , and the liver . The midgut gives rise to the small intestine and the ascending colon . The hindgut gives rise to the remaining portion of the colon , or large intestine , and the rectum . The separa - tion of these three domains involves the com - binatorial response to growth factors that have anteriorizing or posteriorizing effects . In par - ticular , Wnt and fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) signaling have been shown to inhibit anterior gut fate and instead promote posterior fate , which can lead to midgut and hindgut identi - ties ( 31 , 32 ) . This knowledge of the posteriorizing effects of Wnts and FGFs provides the foundation on which human intestinal organoids are built ( 33 ) ( Fig . 3 ) . Human PSCs can be driven toward a hindgut identity by initially applying activin A , a nodal - related molecule , to drive mesendoder - mal identity . The subsequent addition of pos - teriorizing Wnt3a and Fgf4 then specifies the hindgut , the precursor to the intestine . Orig - inally , this specification was performed in 2D , but surprisingly , the cells spontaneously formed hindgut tubes that budded off to form spheroids . This illustrates the remarkable self - organizing ability of these progenitors , a property that al - lows them to generate complete 3D organoids when grown in a permissive environment . The laboratory of Hans Clevers had previously shown that adult intestinal stem cells could form organ - oids when cultured in 3D in Matrigel ( 34 ) . These adult - derived organoids self - organized to form 3D crypt - villus structures that mimicked the phys - iology and organization of the intestine and could even be transplanted into mice ( 35 ) . Similarly , hindgut spheroids generated from human PSCs can be grown in Matrigel 3D growth condi - tions to further develop to mature intestinal organoids ( 33 ) . Intestinal organoids develop crypt - villus struc - tures with stratified epithelium consisting of all the major cell lineages of the gut ( 33 , 34 ) . These include columnar epithelial enterocytes with a brush border of apical microvilli . Furthermore , cell divisions occur at the base of the villus - like protrusions , and intestinal stem cells could be identified by their expression of Lgr5 in more advanced organoids . Finally , these organoids dis - played intestinal functions including absorptive and secretory activity . Although the intestine is the only gut region so far generated from PSCs , other regions of the digestive tract have been developed into organ - oids from adult stem cells . In particular , gastric organoids have been generated from adult py - loric stem cells ( 36 ) or chief cells of the stomach ( 37 ) . Lingual organoids have been established from adult tongue epithelium ( 38 ) . These ap - proaches similarly use the 3D Matrigel envi - ronment , which suggests that Matrigel is a general requirement in GI tract organoid formation . Furthermore , the use of adult progenitor pop - ulations in this manner provides an additional , often more direct , route to the generation of organoids . Liver organoids The liver is primarily derived from endoderm , developing from an outgrowth of ventral fore - gut epithelium that develops into a hepatic bud structure ( 39 ) . This hepatic bud produces the hepatoblasts that generate both hepatocytes and biliary epithelium , whereas adjacent mesoderm - derived mesenchyme contributes liver fibro - blasts and stellate cells . The growth of the liver bud involves extensive vascularization and eventu - ally it develops into the major fetal site of hematopoiesis . Thus , liver development repre - sents a complex interplay of both endoderm - and mesoderm - derived tissues . Early reaggregation studies had shown that dissociated chick embryonic hepatic tissue can reaggregate and organize into secretory units typical of the liver and consistent with forma - tion of functional bile ducts ( 9 ) . More recently , a progenitor population in adult mouse liver that is activated after injury was identified that could generate 3D liver organoids when grown in Matrigel ( 40 ) . These adult - derived liver organ - oids display cells with biliary ductal identities and can be differentiated to form mature , func - tional hepatocytes . Finally , liver organoids can be transplanted into mice and were shown to partially rescue mortality in a mouse model of liver disease , pointing to their functionality .

Principles of self - organization . ( A ) Cell sorting out describes the movement of cells into different domains . Different cell types ( purple or green ) sort themselves because of different adhesive properties conferred by their differential expression of distinct cell adhesion molecules ( shown as brown or orange bars ) . ( B ) Spatially restricted cell - fate decisions also contribute to self - organization in vivo and in organoids . Progenitors ( green ) give rise to more differentiated progeny ( purple ) , which , because of spatial constraints of the tissue and / or division orientation , are forced into a more superficial position that promotes their differentiation . These cells can sometimes further divide to give rise to more differentiated progeny ( pink ) , which are further displaced . RESEARCH | REVIEW Although similar human liver organoids have not yet been generated , a very different approach was recently established to generate tissues re - miniscent of human liver buds ( 41 ) . Beginning with differentiation of human PSCs into hepatic endodermal cells in 2D , this method mixes three cell populations : the human PSC – derived hepatic cells , human mesenchymal stem cells , and hu - man endothelial cells . This mixed - cell population mimics the early cell lineages of the developing liver . When mixed to a high density on a layer of Matrigel , the cells spontaneously form a 3D ag - gregate . The liver bud – like aggregates display vas - cularization and can be ectopically transplanted into mice to allow blood supply . Perhaps most promising is the finding that mice with transplants of these liver bud tissues exhibit human - specific metabolites in the blood . Furthermore , survival of mice subjected to liver injury increased when liver buds were transplanted into them . Brain organoids The vertebrate central nervous system derives from the neural ectoderm ( 6 ) . This tissue gives rise to the neural plate , which folds and fuses to form the neural tube , an epithelium with apical - basal polarity radially organized around a fluid - filled lumen that eventually forms the brain ventricles . Axes are established through the con - certed action of morphogen gradients , such as the ventral - dorsal Shh - Wnt / Bmp axis , and the rostral - caudal axis influenced by factors such as retinoic acid and FGF ( 42 ) . These axes allow the epithelial tube to subdivide into four major re - gions , the forebrain , midbrain , hindbrain , and spinal cord . The forebrain gives rise to the ma - jority of the human brain , including the neo - cortex , hippocampus , and ventral telencephalic structures , such as amygdala and hypothalamus . The midbrain gives rise to the tectum , whereas the hindbrain gives rise to the cerebellum , pons , medulla , and brainstem . Generally , neurons are generated from neural stem cells that reside next to ventricles ( 43 ) . Neu - ral stem cells initially expand through symmetric proliferative divisions . During neurogenesis , stem cells switch to asymmetric divisions to give rise to self - renewing progenitors and more differentiated cell types , including neurons and intermediate progenitors ( 44 ) . These more differentiated cells migrate outward to generate stratified structures such as the three layers of the medulla , the seven layers of the optic tectum , and the six layers of the cerebral cortex . Although the final product of neural develop - ment is a highly complex interconnected brain , earlier reaggregation studies suggest that this organ has an intrinsic self - organizing capacity ( 45 ) . When taken at early stages of brain devel - opment , chick neural progenitors self - organized to form clusters of neuroepithelial cells orga - nized in a radial manner surrounding a lumen , reminiscent of the neural tube . The implication of these classic experiments is that if neuroepi - thelium can be derived from PSCs , spontaneous self - organization is likely to occur . Numerous previous studies have made use of in vitro – derived neural stem cells ( NSCs ) from PSCs to study neural differentiation ( 46 ) . How - ever , these homogeneous NSCs lack the character - istic apical - basal polarity and do not recapitulate the complex lineage of NSCs in vivo . As an alter - native approach , neurospheres ( 47 ) are aggre - gates of NSCs that can be used to assess their self - renewing capacity . However , neurospheres are likewise not well organized and , therefore , are limited in their capacity to model many as - pects of brain development . More recently , 2D neural tube – like structures called neural rosettes were established from isolated neuroepithelium or the directed differentiation 1247125 - 4 18 JULY 2014 (cid:127) VOL 345 ISSUE 6194 sciencemag . org SCIENCE Optic cup organoid Hindgut endoderm Mesendoderm PSCs Ectoderm / neuroectoderm Intermediate mesoderm Neuroepithelium Retinal epithelium Wnt3aFgf4 Bmp4Fgf9 20 % KSR 1 . 5 % KSR Matrigel + agitation 2 % matrigel Matrigel RA Minimal media Activin A Cerebral organoid Kidney organoid Intestinal organoid Fig . 3 . Overview of organoid methodologies . Organoid differentiation strategies developed so far from human PSCs . Conditions and growth factors are indicated for the derivation of progenitor identities . For neuroectoderm , minimal medium without serum is used . KSR is knockout serum replacement , a serum - free growth - promoting alternative . Limiting its use , along with a low concentration of Matrigel dissolved in the medium , promotes retinal neuroepithelium , whereas higher KSR and embedding in pure Matrigel promotes the formation of various brain regions . Renal organoids have been generated several ways , but growth factors in common are shown . RESEARCH | REVIEW of PSCs ( 48 , 49 ) . Because neural rosettes re - capitulate apical - basal polarity and exhibit spontaneous radial organization similar to that of the neural tube , they are more capable of recapitulating many aspects of brain devel - opment . These include the production of inter - mediate progenitor types , as well as the timed production of layer identities similar to those in vivo ( 50 ) . However , because of the 2D na - ture of the method , it has many limitations in modeling the overall organization of the devel - oping brain . Therefore , alternative 3D culture methods with the potential to recapitulate brain tissue organ - ization have been used extensively for investiga - tions in the past several years . In particular , work from the lab of Yoshiki Sasai has focused on developing various isolated brain regions in 3D from mouse or human PSCs ( 51 ) . Beginning with EB formation , particular brain region identities can be generated from neuroectoderm . Specifi - cally , forebrain tissues are generated by plating mouse ( 52 ) or human ( 53 ) EBs in 2D and ex - amining adherent cells . However , aggregates de - velop more complex structures when allowed to continue growing in 3D ( 54 ) , eventually generat - ing dorsal forebrain . This method has further been improved in a recent study ( 55 ) that also showed neuronal layering reminiscent of early cerebral cortical development . Other regions can also be generated by mimick - ing endogenous patterning with growth factors . For example , Hedgehog signaling drives ven - tral forebrain tissue ( 56 ) . In addition , cere - bellar identities can be generated by treatment with either Bmp4 and Wnt3a to generate gran - ule neurons ( 57 ) or Hedgehog inhibition to gen - erate Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum ( 58 ) . Conversely , minimizing exogenous bioactive fac - tors , such as serum proteins , promotes hypo - thalamic identity ( 59 ) . Thus , by stimulating neuroectoderm through an EB stage followed by the application of specific growth factors , organoids can be generated for a variety of in - dividual brain regions . More recently , heterogeneous neural organ - oids were established , termed cerebral organ - oids , that contain several different brain regions within individual organoids ( 28 ) ( Fig . 3 ) . The approach similarly begins with EBs , but growth factors are not added to drive particular brain region identities . Instead , the method is influ - enced by the intestinal organoid protocol , name - ly , by embedding the tissues in Matrigel . The extracellular matrix provided by the Matrigel promotes outgrowth of large buds of neuroepi - thelium , which then expand and develop into various brain regions . Cerebral organoids can reach sizes of up to a few millimeters when grown in a spinning bioreactor , which improves nu - trient and oxygen exchange . This expansion al - lows the formation of a variety of brain regions , including retina , dorsal cortex , ventral forebrain , SCIENCE sciencemag . org 18 JULY 2014 (cid:127) VOL 345 ISSUE 6194 1247125 - 5 Table 1 .

Retinal organoids The retina is the light - receptive neural region of the eye and is derived from the neural ectoderm . Initially , the optic vesicle forms as an outgrowth of the diencephalon , the most posterior region of the forebrain ( 60 ) . Like the rest of the CNS , this optic vesicle begins as a pseudostratified neuroepithelium with a fluid - filled lumen . How - ever , concerted movements at two hinge re - gions force the vesicle to fold in on itself , forming the optic cup . Thus , early in retinal development , two adjacent epithelial layers are established : the outer retinal pigmented epithelium and the inner neural retina . This trend of stratification continues and eventually leads to a fully lami - nated tissue containing layers of photoreceptors and supportive cell types , such as bipolar cells and amacrine cells . The retina has a long history of in vitro reag - gregation studies and has been used as a model of retinal layer formation for decades ( 18 ) . The first reaggregates were generated from chick retina in the early 1960s and demonstrated the robustness of retinal self - organization in vitro ( 61 , 62 ) . Subsequent studies have used retinal reaggregates to examine the relations between different cell types and their differentiation and organization ( 63 ) . The evolution to PSC - derived retinal organoids , like other organoid approaches , is built upon a foundation rooted in developmental biology ( Fig . 3 ) . EBs are derived in minimal medium to generate neuroectoderm ( 64 ) . A nominal amount of Matrigel is dissolved in the medium at an early stage to allow the formation of more rigid neuroepithelial tissues , a prerequisite of retinal pigmented epithelium formation . This promotes the formation of buds of retinal primordial tissue similar to the optic vesicle . These buds are then cut away from the rest of the neuroepithelial tis - sues and maintained in a medium that supports retinal tissue identity . The resulting optic cup organoids very closely mimic early retina . They display proper mark - ers of neural retina and retinal pigmented epi - thelium , they display retinal stratification with proper apical - basal polarity , and they undergo morphological tissue shape changes that mimic the stepwise evagination and invagination of the optic cup in vivo . More recently , optic cup organoids were gener - ated from human PSCs ( 65 ) . These human retinal organoids show many of the characteristics com - mon to mouse retina ; however , they display a num - ber of human specific features as well . In particular , the human retinal organoids are larger than mouse organoids , they require more time to develop , and they display certain tissue morphological differ - ences , such as apical nuclear positioning . Kidney organoids The kidney arises from an early embryonic tissue called the intermediate mesoderm , a subdivision of mesodermal identity that develops from the primitive streak ( 66 ) . In vivo , the primitive streak displays opposing gradients of Bmp4 and activin A , which combinatorially specify the endoderm or mesoderm . The intermediate mesoderm is further subspecified through the action of Fgf and Wnt signaling . This tissue then develops into two closely interacting domains , the ureteric bud and the metanephric mesenchyme , which pro - mote each other ’ s growth and branching to de - velop early renal tubules . Like many of the tissues for which organoids have so far been developed , evidence that kid - ney tissue might be capable of self - organization comes from early reaggregation experiments of chick embryonic kidney ( 9 ) . The resultant tis - sues displayed various segments of the nephron , including collecting duct , distal and proximal tubules , and glomeruli formed by the interac - tion with allantoic vessels upon transplantation on the chick allantoic membrane . Furthermore , the tissues could develop the stereotypic orga - nization of the kidney with cortical and medul - lary region . These experiments suggest that , if kidney progenitors can be made from PSCs , these would , in principle , be capable of forming orga - nized tissues if grown in a permissive environment . This principle is what has now been demonstrated by three independent studies ( 67 ) ( Fig . 3 ) . Each of the recently published methods uses various combinations of growth factors to mimic endogenous signaling to drive renal differenti - ation . Specifically , ureteric bud identity can be generated by exposing human induced PSCs in 2D to Bmp4 and Fgf2 to drive mesodermal iden - tities ( 68 ) , followed by subsequent application of retinoic acid , Bmp2 , and activin A . Such ure - teric bud cells can be cocultured with dissociated mouse embryonic kidney to self - organize within the mouse aggregate and populate 3D ureteric bud structures . The second major renal precursor tissue , the metanephric mesenchyme , can instead be gener - ated beginning with an initial EB stage from mouse and human PSCs ( 29 ) . Sequential application of activin A followed by Bmp4 and the Wnt agonist CHIR99021 then induces posterior mesoderm , the precursor to the intermediate mesoderm . Fi - nally , application of retinoic acid followed by Fgf9 then stimulates the tissues to take on a metanephric mesenchyme identity . By coculturing with spinal cord tissue , a known nephric inducer , this tissue can produce well - organized nephric tubules and even nascent glomeruli . Finally , both principal lineages of the kid - ney can be generated together ( 69 ) by applying activin A and Bmp4 to human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) grown in 2D to generate primitive streak identity . These cells transition to an in - termediate mesoderm identity upon exposure to Fgf9 and spontaneously develop further into ureteric bud and metanephric mesenchyme in the absence of further growth factors . Although these specification events were initially per - formed in 2D , the cells take on 3D morphol - ogies by either growing at low density to allow dome - like colonies to form or when cocultured with mouse kidney reaggregates . In both cases , more complex tissues arise in 3D with structures resembling ureteric epithelium and proximal tubules . Organoids from model organisms Despite the relatively few human - derived organo - ids so far described , several others have already been established from mouse PSCs or adult tis - sue stem cells . These include the endoderm - derived thyroid , lung , and pancreas . Thyroid organoids can be produced by overexpression of two fac - tors important for thyroid specification , Nkx2 . 1 and Pax8 , followed by treatment of EBs with thyroid - stimulating hormone ( 70 ) . Lung organoids can develop from cocultured adult bronchioal - veolar stem cells and lung endothelial cells ( 71 ) in Matrigel . And finally , pancreatic organoids can develop from simply plating pancreatic pro - genitor cells in Matrigel ( 72 ) . All three systems give rise to self - organized characteristic epithe - lia and , in the case of thyroid organoids , even synthesis and secretion of functional thyroid hormone . Organoids have also been derived from ectoderm - derived pituitary and inner ear . Specifically , the two identities of the developing pituitary , the neural ectodermal infundibulum and the ade - nohypophysis , could be generated in large EBs grown under ectoderm - promoting conditions ( 73 ) . Remarkably , these pituitary organoids can mature and synthesize pituitary hormones , such as growth hormone , follicle - stimulating hor - mone , and thyroid - stimulating hormone . Addi - tionally , sensory epithelia of the inner ear can be generated from EBs grown under ectoderm - promoting conditions with subsequent treat - ment with Bmp4 followed by Fgf2 to drive otic identity ( 74 ) . The resulting otic vesicles generate functional inner ear sensory epithelia with stereo - cilia and kinocilia . The future of organoid technologies The generation of 3D organoids from human PSCs is currently in its infancy , but the field is rapidly evolving . In the near future , human organoids may be generated for those organs that have al - ready been established in mouse or where a principle of self - organization has already been demonstrated in reaggregation studies . These include skin ( 9 ) , mammary gland ( 75 ) , muscle ( 76 ) , and bone ( 77 ) , to name a few . Paradigms of organ development Because organoids represent an easily accessible model system , they have the potential to open doors to developmental questions that have been difficult or impossible to answer using tra - ditional techniques . This is particularly true for biological principles that are specific to humans . For example , human brain organoids have al - ready been used to examine the unique division mode of human neural stem cells ( 28 ) . Similarly , retinal organoids have been used to test differ - ences between human and rodent tissue morpho - genesis and timing ( 65 ) . Additionally , organoids for the GI tract can be applied to the study of coordinated development of GI organs , a process 1247125 - 6 18 JULY 2014 (cid:127) VOL 345 ISSUE 6194 sciencemag . org SCIENCE RESEARCH | REVIEW that exhibits important differences in humans compared with laboratory animals ( 78 ) . Furthermore , organoids hold the potential to model adult homeostasis as well . Indeed , intes - tinal organoids have already been used to ex - amine the role of the crypt niche in stem cell self - renewal and differentiation ( 79 , 80 ) . This is particularly true for organoids that have been derived from adult progenitors , such as liver and stomach , that closely recapitulate regen - erative events seen in the adult organ . Therapeutic potential Disease modeling will likely be a primary focus of future organoid studies ( Fig . 4 ) . These can range from developmental disorders , cancer , in - fectious disease , and degeneration . For example , gut organoids are already being used to examine infectious diseases ( 81 , 82 ) ; tumor biology ( 83 , 84 ) ; and genetic conditions ( 85 , 86 ) . Along these lines , patient iPSCs will be a val - uable tool in future disease modeling . Recently , kidney organoids were generated from iPSCs derived from a patient with polycystic kidney disease ( 68 ) . Although the method did not test for a phenotype , this will likely represent an im - portant tool in studying this and other genetic kidney disorders . Similarly , retinal organoids have the potential to model human genetic disorders that lead to blindness , such as retinitis pigmen - tosa . These types of disorders can be modeled by making use of patient iPSCs or , alternatively , through the introduction of patient mutations into human PSCs using modern genome - editing technologies . Brain organoids , in particular , have huge po - tential in this respect . They could , in principle , be used to model various neurodevelopmental disorders that have been difficult or impossible to model in animals . Indeed , brain organoids were the first organoids to make use of patient iPSCs in this manner and to model the develop - mental disorder microcephaly ( 28 ) . In the future , cerebral organoids may even have the potential to model disorders such as autism , schizophrenia , or epilepsy , and perhaps even adult - onset disor - ders like neurodegenerative diseases . Organoids also have the potential to be used for testing efficacy and toxicity of drug compounds ( Fig . 4 ) . This could be applied to organoids that model degenerative conditions — for example , liver fibrosis or cystic kidney diseases — where one could screen for effective treatments . If successful , this approach could even cut down on the use of ani - mal testing , reserving it for studies requiring whole - organism readouts . For this , development of human liver organoids would be of particular relevance ( Fig . 4 ) , because the human liver often metabolizes drugs in a manner distinct from animals ’ metabolism . Drugs can be removed at early stages of screening when they could other - wise be functional in humans , or more drastically , toxic metabolites can be produced specifically in humans but not in tested animals . Methods to screen compounds in an in vitro human liver model are therefore being investigated as an alternative in the drug discovery process ( 87 ) . Human liver buds have already been shown to produce human - specific metabolites ( 41 ) , which suggests that liver organoids could represent an ideal system to perform these types of studies . Finally , organoids have the potential to pro - vide alternative approaches to cell or even whole - organ replacement strategies in the clinic ( Fig . 4 ) . Organoids could provide a source of autologous tissue for transplantation . In this respect , renal organoids hold enormous therapeutic potential as this is the organ with the highest rate of end - stage failure leading to the highest organ demand for transplants . Already , Taguchi et al . succeeded in transplanting kidney organoids under the renal capsule of adult mice , which led to vasculari - zation , a promising step toward a replacement strategy ( 29 ) . Additionally , retinal organoids could be used to treat certain types of retinal degeneration and blindness . Indeed , stem cell – therapy clinical trials are already under way to replace certain degen - erating retinal cell types ( 88 ) . Retinal organoids could provide an alternative approach that may better recapitulate development and , therefore , produce particular cell types of interest for trans - plantation . Finally , intestinal organoids could pro - vide a treatment option for replacement of damaged colon after injury or following removal of dis - eased tissue . Remarkably , intestinal organoid trans - plantation has already been performed in mice and can contribute to colon repair after injury ( 35 , 89 ) . Organoid approaches could even allow for gene correction in the case of genetic defects , using modern genome - editing technologies to replace damaged organ with repaired tissue . Although it is clear that there are many po - tential uses for organoids , it is important to keep in mind their current limitations . In particular , all of the organoid systems so far established re - main to be thoroughly characterized with regard to the extent of recapitulation of in vivo develop - ment . For example , although retinal organoids nicely display typical laminar organization , outer segments fail to form ; for example , photorecep - tors fail to fully mature to become light - sensitive . Likewise , cerebral organoids recapitulate fairly early events in brain development , but later fea - tures , such as cortical plate layers , fail to fully form . The issue of maturation seems to be a com - mon hurdle in organoid technologies , and it re - mains to be seen whether this will significantly affect their therapeutic and research potential .

Therapeutic potential of organoids . Organoids can be used to model diseases ( beige box ) , for example modeling neurodevelopmental disorders with cerebral organoids . These types of disease models can then be used for testing drug efficacy in vitro before moving to animal models ( green box ) . Drug compounds can be tested for toxicity and metabolic profile in liver organoids ( gray box ) . And finally , organoids could be made from patient cells to provide autologous transplant solutions ( pink box ) . RESEARCH | REVIEW Human intestinal organoids have been shown to display characteristics of mature intestine , producing Lgr5 + adult stem cells ( 33 ) . Other organoids could perhaps be coaxed to fully ma - ture once transplanted , either ectopically or for therapeutic purposes . These studies will likely be a primary focus of future organoid research . Finally , the lack of vascularization is generally an issue with organoids in vitro . Because of lim - itations in nutrient supply , organoids have a limited growth potential , which can also affect their maturation . Vascularization is an issue in tissue engineering as a whole , and various ap - proaches have been taken to address it . In the case of organoids , spinning bioreactors can pro - vide better nutrient exchange allowing for sizes of up to a few millimeters ( 28 ) . Alternatively , cocul - ture with endothelial cells can generate vascular - like networks ( 41 ) . Perhaps the most promising solution , however , is the transplantation of these tissues , as has been done for liver buds and kid - ney organoids , which stimulates invasion from host vasculature ( 29 ) . Overall , organoids have enormous potential to model development and disease , as a tool for drug testing , and as a therapeutic approach . Future efforts will no doubt bring them closer to reach - ing that potential . REFERENCES AND NOTES 1 . R . Lanza , J . Gearhart , B . Hogan , D . Melton , R .
