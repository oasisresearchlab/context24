end3 and end4 : Two Mutants Defective in Receptor - mediated and Fluid - phase Endocytosis in Saccharomyces cer isiae Susan Raths , Jack Rohrer , Fabienne Crausaz , and Howard Riezman Biocenter of the University of Basel , Klingelbergstrasse 70 , CH - 4056 Basel , Switzerland Abstract . a - factor , one of two peptide hormones responsible for synchronized mating between MATa and MATa - cell types in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , binds to its cell surface receptor and is internalized in a time - , temperature - , and energy - dependent manner ( Chvatchko , Y . , I . Howald , and H . Riezman . 1986 . Cell . 46 : 355 - 364 ) . After internalization , a - factor is delivered to the vacuole via vesicular intermediates and degraded there consistent with an endocytic mech - anism ( Singer , B . , and H . Riezman . 1990 . J . Cell Biol . 110 : 1911 - 1922 ; Chvatchko , Y . , I . Howald , and H . Riezman . 1986 . Cell . 46 : 355 - 364 ) . We have iso - lated two mutants that are defective in the internaliza - tion process . Both mutations confer a recessive , temperature - sensitive growth phenotype upon cells that cosegregates with their endocytosis defect . Lucifer yel - low , a marker for fluid - phase endocytosis , shows ac - cumulation characteristics in the mutants that are simi - lar to the uptake characteristics of 35S - a - factor . The endocytic defect in end4 cells appears immediately upon shift to restrictive temperature and is reversible at permissive temperature if new protein synthesis is allowed . Furthermore , the end4 mutation only affects a - factor internalization and not the later delivery of a - factor to the vacuole . Other vesicle - mediated pro - cesses seem to be normal in end3 and end4 mutants . END3 and END4 are the first genes shown to be neces - sary for the internalization step of receptor - borne and fluid - phase markers in yeast . NDOCVTOSIS plays a key role in cell physiology , fore - most of which is its function in the uptake of micronutrients such as iron ( Hemmaplardh and Mor - gan , 1976 ; Karin and Mintz , 1981 ) and cholesterol ( Ander - son et al . , 1977 ) . Other possible roles for endocytosis in - clude the regulation of hormone response by clearance of responsive elements from the membrane ( downregulation ; Beguinot et al . , 1984 ) , recapture of desialylated proteins and lysosomal proteins from extracellular fluids ( Spiess , 1990 ; Kornfeld and Mellman , 1989 ) , antigen processing and pre - sentation ( Harding and Unanue , 1989 ) , transcellular trans - port ofimmunoglobulins ( Kulm and Krahenbuhl , 1982 ) , and controlled redistribution of plasma membrane proteins be - tween apical and basolateral surfaces of cells ( Bartles et al . , 1987 ; Matter et al . , 1990 ) . As is evident in the examples listed above , most of the studies to date have involved the use of mammalian cells . However , endocytosis has also been described in the budding yeast , Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Riezman , 1985 ) . Using Lucifer yellow - CH ( LY ) , 1 a marker for fluid - phase inter - nalization in mammalian cells , we provided the first evidence Susan Raths ' present address is Department of Biology , University of Mis - sissippi , Oxford , Mississippi . 1 . Abbreviations used in this paper : CPY , carboxypeptidase Y ; EMS , ethylmethanesulfonate ; LY , Lucifer yellow ; ts , temperature sensitive . that the endocytic pathway exists in yeast . LY was shown to accumulate in the yeast vacuole with nonsaturable kinetics under conditions showing time , temperature , and energy de - pendence . Furthermore , several of the secretory mutants , namely those conditionally defective in the later steps of secretion were also found to be defective in the accumulation of LY , suggesting some physical or operational overlap be - tween the pathways of secretion and endocytosis in yeast . Subsequent studies by Chvatchko et al . ( 1986 ) showed that ( x - factor , one of the two peptide pheromones secreted by haploid cell types of S . cerevisiae for mating preparation and conjugation , is also internalized , however only when specifically bound to Mata cells . Once internalized , a - factor is delivered to the vacuole via a vesicular intermediate where it is rapidly degraded in a vacuolar protease - dependent pro - cess ( Chvatchko , 1987 ; Dulic and Riezman , 1989 ; Singer and Riezman , 1990 ) . Concurrent with these findings , Jen - ness and Spatrick ( 1986 ) showed that cellular uptake of a - fac - tor is accompanied by a loss of ( x - factor binding sites from the plasma membrane . After this initial period of ~ down - regulation S cultures reaccumulate newly synthesized recep - tor sites at the cell surface . These two studies provided cor - roborative evidence for receptor - mediated endocytosis in yeast and in conjunction with the LY results opened the prob - lem to genetic and biochemical dissection using this simple eukaryote . In animal cells several different selection techniques have g ) The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 93 / 01 / 55 / 11 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 120 , Number 1 , January 1993 55 - 65 55 been developed intending to isolate mutants specifically blocked in the endocytic pathway ( Colbaugh et al . , 1988 ; Robbins et al . , 1983 ; Krieger et aL , 1985 ; Merion et al . , 1983 ) . However , the mutants isolated to date are not specific to this pathway and also show defects in organeHe acidifica - tion and / or secretion . In addition , even though many poly - peptides , including clathrin , its associated proteins ( Pearse and Robinson , 1990 ) , and small GTP binding proteins ( Chavrier et al . , 1990 ) have been found to be associated with this pathway none of these have been shown to be essential . However , in Drosophila , the shibire mutant has been shown to be defective in endocytic uptake ( Kosaka and Ikeda , 1983 ) . The shibire gene encodes the protein dynamin that could possibly act as a microtubule - based motor ( Chen et aL , 1991 ; Obar et al . , 1990 ) . The precise role of dynamin in endocytosis has not been discovered nor are we aware of studies analyzing constitutive secretion and lysosome bio - genesis in the shibire mutant . In yeast , initial attempts to obtain endocytosis mutants using LY accumulation as a screen led to the isolation of two temperature - sensitive mutants , end / and end2 ( Chvatchko et al . , 1986 ) . Further characterization of the end / mutant ( Dulic and Riezman , 1989 , 1990 ) has shown that it also affects vacuole biogenesis . As no distinguishable vacuole is present in the mutant it is not possible to say whether it is primarily defective in endocytosis , vacuole biogenesis , or both . Recent results with end2 have shown that this mutant internalizes a - factor normally , but is defective in its subse - quent delivery to the vacuole ( D . Hamburger and H . Riez - man , personal communication ) . In an attempt to identify proteins required for the inter - nalization step in yeast , we screened cells from an ethyl - methanesulfonate ( EMS ) - mutagenized bank for strains de - fective in 3sS - a - factor uptake . In this report , we describe the isolation and phenotypic characterization of two new en - docytic mutants identified from this screen , end3 and end4 . These mutants are temperature sensitive for growth , fail to internalize a - factor , its receptor , or to accumulate LY in the vacuole at restrictive temperature . Further analysis indicates that secretory traffic and vacuole biogenesis are normal in these mutants and that the end4 mutation specifically ai ~ ts the step ( s ) of the endocytic pathway before the formation of the previously identified endosomal compartments . These mutants represent the first yeast mutants that specifically block the endocytic pathway at the internalization step . Materials and Methods Strains , Media , and Reagents The strains of S . cerevisiae used in these experiments were RHI44 - 3D ( MA ~ his4 leu2 ura3 barI - I ) , RH144 - 3B ( MA ~ his4 leu2 urn3 barl - I endl : : LEU2 ) , RH266 - 1D ( MA ~ end3 urn3 leu2 his4 barl - l ) , RH268 - 1C ( MA ~ end4 ura3 leu2 his4 barl - 1 ) , and RH1765 ( MA ~ urn3 his4 / eu2 trpl : : URA3 barl - 1 ) . RH449 ( Ma ~ his4 leu2 ura3 lys2 bad - l ) tramformed with pl ) A6300 ( a 2u - based plasmid containing the MFa / , STE / 3 , and LELr2 genes , provided by D . Barnes and J . Thorner , University of California , Berkeley , CA ) was used for ssS - a - factor production as described previ - ously ( Dulic aad Riezman , 1989 ; Dulic et al . , 1990 ) . All yeast strains were grownin complete medium ( YPUAD ) conteining 1 % yeast extract , 2 % pep - tone , 40 # g / ml ttrr ~ l and adenine , and 2 % glucose or minimal medium ( SD ) as descried previoualy ( Dulic et al . , 1990 ) . Nutritional supplements were added when needed as described ( Sherman et al . , 1983 ) . Cells used for radiolabeling and carboxypeptidase Y ( CPY ) immunoprecipitation were grown in SD low - sulfate medium where ammonium sulfate was at 50 # M , and radiolaheled in SD no - sulfate medium in which all sulfate saltswere substituted by chloride salts ( Dulic et al . , 1990 ) aad comaining 2 mg / ml BSA . Inhibitor medium was YPUAD with the addition of 10 mM sodium azide , I0 mM potassium fluoride and 10 mM p - tosyl - L - argininemethylester ( TAME ; Jenness et al . , 1983 ; Jenness and Spatrick , 1986 ) . Carrier - free H235SO4 was obtained from New England Nuclear ( Boston , MA ) . Biosyn - thetically labeled 35S - a - factor was purified according to published proce - dures ( Jenness et al . , 1983 ; Dulic et al . , 1990 ) . Chemicals used for SDS - PAGE were purchased from Bio - Rad Laboratories ( Richmond , CA ) , LY Carbohydrazide was obtained from Fluka ~ uchs , Switzerland ) . a - factor was synthesized at the Biochemistry Institute of the University of Lausanne ( Switzerland ) . Mutant Isolation and Screening Yeast s ~ ' ain RH144 - 3D was mutagenized with EMS ( Sigma Chemical Co . , St . Louls ~ MO ) as described previously by Novick and Schekman 0979 ) . RH144 - 3D ceils were grown overnight at 24 ~ in YPUAD to stationary phase . After harvesting by cenu - ifugadon , the cells were prepared for muta - genesis by resuspension to 1 . 4 (cid:141) 10 s cells / ml in I00 mM potassium phos - phate buffer , pH 7 , containing EMS ( final concentration 3 % ) . After 30 rain of incubation at 30 ~ on a rotary shaker the mutagen was quenched by the addition of sodium thiosni1 ~ te to a final concentration of 5 % . The cells were then washed two times with 5 % sodium thiosulfate and finally resuspended in YPUAD ( 1 (cid:141) 107 cells / n ~ split into t0 different tubes ) to allow for recovery by incubation at 24 ~ After 24 h of recovery , aliquots of each of the 10 separate cultures were plated to YPUAD for single colony isolation . After 2 d of growth at 24 ~ the colonies were replica plated onto two YPUAD plates ( one incubated at 24 ~ and the other at 37 ~ and ther - mosensitive strains were identified by plate comparison . Clones that grew at 24 ~ but not at 37 ~ were subjected to the following screen for R - factor internalization : Cul ~ L , ~ s of thermosensitive clones were g / x ) wn to a density of 1 (cid:141) 107 cells / ml at 24 ~ in YPUhA ) . Once harvested the cells were resuspended to a density of I (cid:141) 109 cells / ml in YPUAD and preincubated 10 rain at 24 ~ or 37 ~ in a shaking water bath . 35S ~ - factor ( t (cid:141) 105 cpm / 109 cells , specific activity 5 - 10 Ci / mmol ) was then ~ dded to both tubes and the incu - bation continued at each of the respective temperatures for 30 rain . Binding and internalization were evaluated by transferring 100 - / A samples in dupli - cate to 20 ml of ice - cold 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer , pH 6 , and 20 ml of ice - cold 50 mM sodium citrate buffer , pHL The pH 6 samples were filtered immediately through nitrocellulose filters ( type HA , 45 # m , Millipore Corporation , Bedford , MA ) and subsequently washed with 15 ml of the same buffer , pH 1 samples were allowed to sit on ice for 20 rain before filtering and washing as described above . All filters were baked at 90 ~ for 1 h before adding 5 ml of Emulsifier ( Packard , Crroningen , Netherlands ) safe for scintillation counting . Strains which bound 35S - a - faVor at wild - type levels but failed to internalize it were next screened for protein synLhe - sis ability ( Chvatchko et aL , t986 ) . Colonies were grown in minimal n ~ dinm contslniw ~ 200 # M ammonium sulfate at 24 ~ overnight . 2 (cid:141) 107 cells were harvested and resuspended in 40 ~ tl of no - sulfate minimal medium and allowed to preincubate 10 rain at either 24 or 37 ~ 25 / d of SD no - sulfate medium containing 3 ~ Ci H235S04 was then added and the incorporation of 35SO42 - checked at 5 , 10 , and 30 rain by withdrawing 15 - # 1 samples and diluting them into 500 # l t0 % ice - cold TCA . After 30 rain on ice these samples were faltered , washed with 10 % I ~ A , ethanol , etha - nol : ether ( 50 / 50 , vol / vol ) , and ether before counting in Emulsifier - safe scin - tillation fluid . Mutants that failed to incorporate 35S into TCA - precipitable counts were discarded . Two mutants , RH1565 ( MA ~ end3 uro3 h / s4 / eu2 barl - 1 ) and RH1574 ( MA ~ end4 ura3 his4 leu2 bad - l ) were found in the first 113 temperature - sensitive clones screened . Before experimentation with these mutants was continued , they were backcrossed twice to RH1765 , a stnda that ls lsogenic to the parent , RH144 - 3D and the tetrads were dis - sected and analyzed using standard genetic techniques ( Sherman et el . , 1983 ) . Two segregants from the second backa ~ s , Rtt266 - 1D ( end3 ) and RH268 - 1C ( end4 ) , were used for all experiments presented in this paper . a - factor Internalization and Receptor Clearance Assays Internalization of a - factor was assayed as described ( Dulic et al . , 1990 ) using biosynthetically labeled ~ sS - c ~ factor . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 120 , 1993 56 Downregulation of receptor sites was assayed in end3 , end4 , and wild - type strains essentially as described ( Jenness and Spatrick , 1986 ) . In brief , strains were grown overnight in YPUAD medium at 24 ~ to a density of 1 (cid:141) 107 cells / ml . After harvesting , two 120 - ml cultures containing 5 (cid:141) 106 cells / ml in YPUAD and 10 mM TAME were prepared . The first stage of the experiment ( receptor clearance ) was initiated with the addition of a - factor ( 10 - 7 M final concentration ) to one of the cultures and the same volume of water to the other culture as a control . Incubation was continued at either 24 or 35 ~ and at the indicated times 20 - ml aliquots ( 1 (cid:141) 10 s cells ) were withdrawn and collected on nitrocellulose filters . Filters con - raining cells were washed two times with 20 ml of inhibitor medium ( see Strains and Media section for composition ) and the cells were subsequently resuspended in 20 ml of inhibitor medium at 25 ~ to allow for dissociation . After 2 h of incubation the cells were harvested and resnspended in 500 # 1 of ice - cold inlubitor medium and held on ice for up to 2 h before beginning Stage II of the experiment . To determine the number of a - factor binding sites remaining after each time of preexposure to a - factor in Stage I , two duplicate binding reactions were set up for Stage II of the experiment as fol - lows . In this procedure , 35S - a - factor ( 30 , 000 cpm ) was added to 100 ~ 1 of cells ( 2 x 107 cells ) in inhibitor medium for the test reactions and asS - labeled a - factor ( 30 , 000 cpm ) , 2 (cid:141) 107 cells and unlabeled a - factor to a final concentration of 2 (cid:141) 10 - 5 M were combined for the control reactions . After an incubation of 30 rain at 25 ~ 90 / ~ 1 ( representing 1 . 5 (cid:141) 107 cells ) were diluted into 20 ml of inhibitor medium and filtered using Wbatman GF / C filters ( Millipore Corp . ) Filters were washed once with 20 ml of inhib - itor medium before being dried for scintillation counting in 5 ml Emulsifier - Safe scintillant . Those counts which could be competed by 2 x 10 - 5 M un - labeled a - factor were considered to represent specific binding . LY - C H Accumulation LY accumulation experiments were performed as described ( Riezman , 1985 ) with the following minor changes . Yeast cultures grown overnight at 24 ~ were harvested and resuspended to l0 T cells / ml for the assay . One aliquot of cells were slowly brought to 35 ~ by adjusting the temperature setting on the water bath from 24 to 35 ~ Once 35 ~ was reached , LY was added to 4 mg / ml . To the other aliquot LY was immediately added to 4 mg / ml . After 2 h at 24 ~ or 1 h at 35 ~ the cells were prepared for micro - scopic viewing by washing extensively with ice - cold 50 mM sodium suc - cinate buffer , pH 5 , containing 10 raM sodium azide . The washed cells were then applied to poly L - lysine - coated microscopic slides . Cells were ob - served using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Inc . , Thornwood , NY ) and fluorescence or Nomarski optics as described ( Riezman , 1985 ) . Photographs were made using Kodak , T - Max 400 film ( Eastman Co . , Rochester , NY ) pushed to ASA 1 , 600 for the fluorescence pictures . Exposures were 20 to 25 s . To quantify the results cells with a clear vacuolar staining with LY were counted as positive . Cells without vacuolar staining , but with a clearly distinguishable vacuole by Nomarski optics were counted as negative to ensure that the vacuole was in focus . A minimum of 46 cells were counted . Invertase Secretion Assay Yeast cells were grown overnight at 24 ~ in YPUAD medium containing 5 % glucose to approximately 8 x 106 cells / ml . The culture was shifted to 37 ~ slowly by simply readjusting the temperature setting on the waterbath from 24 to 37 ~ 10 min after the waterbath reached 37 ~ 3 . 5 x 107 cells were removed and put on ice as an uninduced control . The remaining cells were harvested by centrifugation , washed two times with water equilibrated to 37 ~ and resuspended to the original volume ( 8 x 106 cells / ml ) in prewanned ( 37 ~ YPUAD containing only 0 . 1 % glucose . At the indicated times , 3 . 5 (cid:141) 107 cells were removed , pelleted at 4 ~ and resuspended in 500 ~ 1 ice - cold 10 mM sodium azide . From each 500 / A aliquot , 250 / d were removed for the determination of the amount of external invertase present and the other 250 / d used for the determination of the total ( internal + external ) invertase activity present . The amount of total invertase activity was determined by pelleting the cells taken at each time point and resuspending them in the original volume of ice - cold 1 % Triton X - 100 , 10 mM sodium azide . After freezing and thawing the aliquots once in liquid nitrogen , the cells were pelleted and washed again with cold 10 mM sodium azide and finally resuspended in 250 / tl 10 mM sodium azide . The amount of external invertase present was determined directly using the other half of the aliquot taken at each time point . Invertase assays were performed as described by Goldstein and Lampen ( 1975 ) using incubations without su - cruse as controls . CPY Biogenesis Radiolabeling of cells , either end3 ( RH266 - 1D ) , end4 ( RH268 - 1C ) , end / ( RH144 - 3B ) , or wild type ( RH144 - 3D ) for immunoprecipitation of CPY was accomplished using a method similar to that published by Dulic and Riezman ( 1989 ) . Strains were first grown to stationary phase in YPUAD medium . The cells were harvested , washed in SD low - sulfate medium and used to inoculate a 50 - ml culture of SD low - sulfate medium to a density of 5 x 106 cells / ml . This culture was then allowed to incubate 6 h at 24 ~ to induce the sulfate permease . The low sulfate culture was then harvested and the cells washed with SD no - sulfate media and finally resuspended to 2 x l0 s cells / ml in SD no - sulfate medium containing 2 mg / ml BSA . Cells ( 2 . 5 ml ) were preincabated 10 rain at 37 ~ before adding 25 # I of H23sSO4 ( 40 mCi / ml ) . The cells were incubated at 37 ~ for 5 rain . Ammonium sul - fate was added to 2 mM final concentration and methionine and cysteine were added each to 20 / zg / ml to initiate the period of chase . At 0 , 5 , 10 , 15 , and 30 min of chase , 500 / ~ I of the culture was removed to microfuge tubes on ice containing 50 / ~ l of 0 . 2 M NAN3 / 0 . 2 M NaF . At the end of the chase , intracellular and extracellular ( medium plus periplasm ) extracts were prepared for immunoprecipitation ( Stevens et al . , 1986 ) . Briefly , the cells were collected by centrifugation in a micmfuge ( 3 , 000 g , 5 rain ) and the supernatant was withdrawn . The cells were converted to spberoplasts using lyticase ( Stevens et al . , 1986 ) for 45 min at 30 ~ in the presence of 20 mM each NaN3 and NaF . The spheroplasts were collected ( 3 , 000 g , 5 rain ) and the supernatant ( periplasm ) removed to a fresh tube . The medium and periplasm were denatured by adding SDS to 1 % , boiled immediately , and then combined . The spheroplasts were resuspended in 95 ~ 1 % SDS ( 0 . 5 ml ) and immediately heated at 95 ~ for 3 - 5 rain . The extracts were then clarified in the microfuge at 15 , 000 g for 30 rain . Sodium azide was added to 10 mM and the immunoprecipitations were performed as de - scribed ( Gasser et al . , 1982 ) using a polyclonal antibody raised in rabbits against CPY . Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS - PAGE ( Laemmli , 1970 ) on 10 % gels with fluorographic enhancement using 1 M sodium salicylate . The films were quantified by scanning using a densitometer ( Mo - lecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , CA ) . ~ - factor Degradation Assay a - factor degradation assays were performed as described by Dulic and Riez - man ( 1989 ) . end4 ( RH268 - 1C ) and wild - type cells ( RHI44 - 3D ) grown at 24 ~ to < 107 cells / rul were harvested and allowed to bind 35S - a - factor ( 20 , 000 cpm / 109 cells ) on ice for 1 h . 100 - / ~ 1 duplicate aliquots were re - moved to ( a ) determine the total amount of cell - associated radioactivity and the internalized amount of 35S - a - factor by the internalization assay and ( b ) evaluate the condition of the 35S - a - factor , if internalized , as in a normal degradation assay . Once the aliquots were withdrawn , the remainder of the binding reaction was centrifuged for 3 rain at 3 , 500 rpm at 4 ~ and the cells resuspended to the same density ( 1 (cid:141) 109 cells / ml ) in medium prewarmed to 15 ~ for 20 min to allow ~ factor internalization but retard delivery to the vacuole . At 20 rain , the cells were pelleted again for 3 rain at 3 , 500 rpm , 4 ~ and resnspended to the same density ( I (cid:141) 109 cells / ml ) in medium prewarmed to 34 ~ At the indicated times after shift to 34 ~ 100 - / ~ 1 ali - quots were withdrawn and the a - factor extracted for thin - layer chromatog - raphy as described earlier ( Dulic and Riezman , 1989 ) . Intact and degraded pheromone were resolved using preparative silica gel 60 plates ( 2 . 2 - ram - thick , 20 x 20 cm , Merck , Germany ) and the n - butanol : propionic acid : wa - ter , 50 : 25 : 35 ( vol / vol / vol ) solvent system used previously ( Dullc et al . , 1990 ) . EN3HANCE spray ( DuPont de Nemours International , S . A . , Regensdorf , Switzerland ) was used to coat the plates for fluorography using Kodak XAR - 5 film ( Eastman Kodak Co . ) . a - factor Sensitivity RI - I144 - 3D , RH266 - 1D , or RI - I268 - 1C cells were grown to early logarith - mic phase and counted . The cells ( 5 (cid:141) 105 / mi ffi 1 (cid:141) final concentration ) were washed with YPUAD and then mixed with YPUAD medium in 0 . 8 % agar at 47 ~ 5 ml was immediately poured into petri dishes ( 94 (cid:141) 16 ram ; Greiner Labortechnik , Niirtingen , Germany ) . As soon as the medium solldilied , the plates were moved to 4 ~ until use . a - factor solutions in wa - ter were used to apply I0 , 20 , or 50 ug ( in 20 / ~ I ) of a - factor to one side of 6 . 3 - mm filter disks ( Schleicber and Schuell , Feldbach , Switzerland ) which were then placed , ~ factor - side down , on top of the test plates . The plates were then incubated 1 - 2 d at 24 or 30 ~ and the resulting halo di - ameters were measured . Each experiment was performed in duplicate and the halo diameters were averaged . Raths et al . Yeast Endocytosis Mutants 57 Results Isolation and Preliminary Characterization of the end3 and end4 Mutants The primary objective of the initial stages of this work was to begin a molecular dissection of the endocytic pathway for receptor - borne markers in yeast through the isolation and characterization of endocytic mutants . Towards this goal , we used the simple assay of a - factor internalization to screen a bank of temperature - sensitive lethal strains generated using EMS mutagenesis . From a total of 2 , 000 colonies plated af - ter mutagenesis , 75 mutants temperature sensitive ( ts ) for growth were isolated . Of these 75 ts mutants , two isolates , later named end3 and end4 , were identified in the prelimi - nary screening by determining that < 20 % of the 3 ~ S - a - factor bound at 370C could be internalized after a 30 min in - cubation at that temperature . Control incubations of cells with 35S - a - factor at 24 ~ revealed that one mutant , end3 , was also unable to internalize or - factor at 240C , permissive growth temperature . The other mutant , end4 , internalized ' ~ , 70 % of the total bound oL - factor after 30 min at 240C in control incubations during the initial screen . Once protein synthesis at 370C for the end3 and end4 mu - tants waS confirmed , inheritance of the temperature sensitive phenotype and the endocytic defect was followed through two generations for each mutant . All MATa progeny were tested for a - factor uptake . The ts growth defect always cosegregated with the endocytic defect indicating that a single genetic le - sion is responsible for both phenotypes . Diploid strains made from the mating of both mutants with the wild - type strain ( RH144 - 3D ) and diploids made from mating the end3 mutant with the end4 mutant are not temperature sensitive for growth . Therefore , both mutations are recessive and complement each other . The endocytic defects of the two mu - tants are also recessive . end3 and end4 Mutants Are Defective in a - factor Internalization , Receptor Downregulation , and LY Accumulation To determine whether these mutants contain true blocks in the endocytosis of a - factor or only affect the rate at which a - factor is taken up , the internalization of 35S - a - factor was followed over time at both permissive and restrictive growth temperatures in each mutant . For these studies , 35S - a - factor was mixed with end3 , end4 , and wild - type cells in YPUAD medium pre - equilibrated to either 24 or 370C . At various times after 35S - a - factor addition , aliquots were withdrawn and diluted into both pH 6 and pH 1 medium to measure the total amount of cell - associated radioactivity and the amount of internalized a - factor , respectively . The results of these experiments are shown in Fig . 1 . oefactor internali - zation was > 95 % of maximum in wild - type cells at both 24 and 37 ~ by 30 rain . In contrast , only 16 and 12 % of the 35S - a - factor bound to end3 ceils was taken up by 30 min at 24 and 37 ~ ( Fig . 1 ) . This level of internalization did not in - crease even if incubation times were extended to 90 rain at both temperatures for end3 cells . When end4 cells were in - cubated with 35S - a - factor at 240C , internalization was again virtually complete by 30 rain ( > 90 % of maximum ) , however the amount of bound a - factor internalized by end4 was less than wild type ( 72 % that of wild type ) . At restrictive temper - 1 r 0 . 8 _ o . 6 I ~ . 0 . 4 o o lO 2o 3o 40 so so 70 so 9o Time ( rain ) Figure 1 . Internalization of 35S - c ~ - factor by end & end4 , and wild - type cells , end3 ( o ) , end4 ( zx ) , or wild - type cells ( n ) were prein - cubated 10 rain at either 24 ( closed symbols ) or 37 ~ ( open sym - bols ) before 35S - e ~ - factor was added and the incubation continued at either 24 or 37 ~ At the times indicated , duplicate samples were diluted to either ice - cold 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer , pH 6 or ice - cold 50 mM sodium citrate buffer , pH 1 buffer and filtered to determine the extent of a - factor internalization . The values rep - resent averages from four experiments . ature end4 cells , like end3 cells , internalized very little bound a - factor , u - factor internalization at 37 ~ by end4 cells never exceeded 12 % of the total bound pheromone even after 90 min of incubation . The installation of the a - factor uptake block in end4 cells requires no preincubation at non - permissive temperature ( > ~ 34 " C ; data not shown ) . Using ini - tial rates of uptake calculated from experiments performed on cells with 35S - o ~ - factor prebound at 0 ~ ( pulse - chase protocol ; Dulic et al . , 1990 ) , the half - times of maximal in - ternalization ( te2 ) of a - factor by the wild - type strain were 9 . 4 and 8 . 4 min at 24 and 37 ~ and 15 . 6 min at 240C for end4 cells . Internalization of a - factor by MATa cells has been shown to be accompanied by a coordinate loss of pheromone - occupied cell - surface binding sites ( Jermess et al . , 1986 ) . To determine whether the mutants clear a - factor receptor bind - ing sites from the cell surface , actively growing cultures of wild type , end3 and end4 strains were subjected to the assay for receptor downregulation ( Jenness and Spatrick , 1986 ) . In brief , after preincubating the cells 10 rain at either 24 or 350C , cultures were divided such that one half received 1 (cid:141) 10 - 7 M unlabeled a - factor and one half received no a - fac - tor at all . At various times , aliquots were withdrawn , the cells washed extensively with YPUAD medium containing the metabolic inhibitors NaN3 and NaF , diluted and held at 25 ~ to allow dissociation of surface - bound a - factor . The binding capacity of each cell sample was subsequently deter - mined by incubation with 35S - a - factor and appropriate pro - cessing for the measurement of cell - bound radioactivity as explained in Materials and Methods . A nonpermissive tem - perature of 35 ~ was chosen for this experiment because there is less a - factor - independent loss of cell surface bind - ing activity than at 37 " C . As shown in Fig . 2 , upon addition of o ~ - factor at either 240C or 37 ~ the wild - type strain lost between 60 and 65 % of its surface binding capacity in the first 15 min ( Fig . 2 ) . End3 cells failed to clear a large propor - tion of receptor binding sites from the cell surface at both The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 120 , 1993 58 2q ~ 55Oc WT end3 end4 13O - ~ 3o - 8 ~ , to . ~ o . lOO E 8 ' 5 ~ o rn 20 1o0 - " 6 eO - rn : m - ~ lOO - i3o - ~ 3o - ~ ~ 4o - , , , , , 5 10 15 20 2 , 5 ~ 0 Time ( mln ) 1oo - " 6 ee - l , 2o - , ~ , , ; , 2 ~ , = ' 5 , o o o Time ( rain ) 100 " 60 , 8 , ~ 3o . 1 ' o 15 2o 25 30 Time ( mln ) , , , , , 15 10 15 20 25 30 Time ( rain ) 5 1 ' 0 18 20 2 ' 5 30 Time ( rain ) ~ , , o . ? r ~ 20 . , , , , , 5 ID 15 2O 25 3O Time ( rain ) Figure 2 . Downregulation of the cz - factor receptor in wild type , end3 , and end4 cells . Wild type , end3 , and end4 cells were preincubated for 10 min at either 24 or 35 " C in YPUAD medium containing 10 mM TAME . At time zero one half of each culture re - ceived 1 x 10 - 7 M unlabeled a - factor ( open symbols ) or no ( x - factor ( closed symbols ) . Duplicate samples were with - drawn at the times indicated , washed thoroughly with in - hibitor medium , and further incubated to allow dissocia - tion of the surface bound a - factor and finally assayed for their ability to bind 35S - , ~ - factor . Values represent the averages from four experi - ments . permissive and restrictive temperatures . There was a small a - factor - dependent decrease in cell surface binding activity in end3 cells . This could have been due to a decrease in receptor binding affinity after a - factor administration due to dissociation from the tripartite G protein ( Blumer and Thorner , 1990 ) or alternatively , could have resulted from an incomplete dissociation of the bound nonradioactive ( x - factor in the assay . One can also see that cell surface binding activ - ity was particularly stable in the end3 mutant at 37 ~ in the presence or absence of ( x - factor . We have no explanation for this phenomenon . As receptor stability was increased with or without pheromone and only at 37 ~ we did not pursue it further . At 24 ~ end4 cells showed slightly more ( x - factor - depen - dent loss of cell surface binding activity than end3 cells , but the amount of this loss was significantly less than wild - type cells under identical incubation conditions ( Fig . 2 ) . In four separate experiments a similar relationship was found be - tween the different strains even though the magnitude of the ( x - factor - dependent reduction in cell surface binding activity varied . The results from this set of experiments support the data from Fig . 1 . Although both end3 and end4 strains are temperature sensitive for growth , only end4 shows a temper - ature - sensitive endocytic defect . The relatively small differ - ence found between end3 and end4 strains in this assay could reflect the nature of the assay itself ( see Discussion ) . En - docytosis of a - factor and its receptor are blocked at both 24 and 37 ~ in the end3 mutant . Since the end3 and end4 mutants were originally isolated using a screen based on ( x - factor internalization , we wished to determine whether these two mutations also affect the in - ternalization of the fluid - phase endocytic marker , LY . end3 , end4 , and wild - type cells were incubated in LY for a period of 1 h at 35 ~ or 2 h at 24 ~ Aliquots were washed exten - sively to remove excess LY and the cells were mounted for viewing under Nomarski and fluorescence optics . The re - sults of this experiment are shown in Fig . 3 . At 24 and 35 ~ LY accumulated in the vacuoles of the wild - type strain as ex - pected , end3 cells , on the other hand , showed almost no ac - cumulation of LY at either 24 or 37 ~ The extremely bright fluorescence seen in the end3 panels ( Fig . 3 ) emanates from lysed cells . LY accumulation in the vacuole of end4 cells was somewhat temperature sensitive . At 24 ~ there was a higher background which seems to be due to a higher binding of LY to the cell wall at this temperature in this strain . At 350C no vacuolar staining of end4 cells were detected ( Fig . 3 ) . As the presence of lysed cells precluded the quantitation of LY in - ternalization as described previously ( Riezman , 1985 ) we quantified the percentage of cells showing clear vacuolar staining . At 240C , 92 % oftbe wild - type cells showed vacuo - lar labeling whereas only 4 % of the end3 cells and 10 % of the end4 cells did . At 35 ~ 97 % of the wild - type cells Raths et al . Yeast Endocytosis Mutants 59 Figure 3 . Accumulation of LY - CH by end3 , end4 , and wild - type cells , end3 , end4 , and wild - type ceils were grown overnight at 24 ~ After harvest , one half of the culture was allowed to continue incubation at 24 ~ while the other half was slowly shifted to 35 ~ After 35 ~ was reached , all cells were incubated with 4 mg / ml LY - CH ( 1 h for 35 ~ sample , 2 h for 24 ~ sample ) , washed and mounted as described in Materials and Methods . Cells were visualized using Nomarski ( left columns ) and fluorescence optics ( right colurans ) . Bar , 10 # m . showed vacuolar labeling whereas 4 % of end3 cells and 0 % of end4 cells showed labeling , The LY phenotypes are most consistent with the a - factor receptor clearance phenotypes shown in Fig . 2 for these two mutants ( see Discussion ) . These data clearly show that the genes defined by the end3 and end4 mutations are necessary for both receptor - mediated and fluid - phase endocytosis in yeast . Secretion of lnvertase and the Maturation of Carboxypeptidase Y Are Normal in the end3 and end4 Mutants Using LY we ( Riezman , 1985 ) showed that some of the yeast mutants conditionally defective in secretion are also defec - tive in endocytosis . This finding suggested some functional overlap between the protein participants of both processes . TO determine whether the end3 or end4 mutations interfere with the transit of proteins through the secretory pathway , the transport of two well - characterized markers , invertase and carboxypeptidase Y , was followed at 37 ~ After induction of invertase synthesis with a shift from 5 to 0 . 1 % glucose , invertase secretion was followed using the standard coloro - metric assay developed by Goldstein and Lampen ( 1975 ) . Fig . 4 shows the results from these experiments . Neither the induction nor the secretion of invertase were affected by in - cubation of the end3 or end4 mutants at restrictive temper - attire . CPY , the second marker of secretion followed in this study , is a soluble vacuolar protease . During transport to the vacuole it follows another branch of the pathway from the Colgi complex to the vacuole instead of from the Golgi com - plex to the plasma membrane . The transit of CPY through the secretory pathway begins in the ER . After cleavage of the signal peptide and core glycosylation a 67 - kD form , pl CPY , is generated that is transported to the Colgi complex where the core oligosaccharides are extended yielding p2 CPY ( 69 kD ) . Finally , before or upon arrival of 132 in the vacuole , the amino - terminal prosequence ( ' ~ 8 kD ) is removed to yield the mature pro ~ se ( m CPY ) ( Stevens et al . , 1982 ) . To as - sess the integrity of this pathway , wild type , end3 and end4 cells were pulse - labeled with H235SO , for 5 min at 37 ~ The pulse was followed by a period of chase initiated by add - ing unlabeled ammonium sulphate , methionine , and cysteine also at 37 ~ At various times during the chase , aliquots of The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 120 , 1993 60 1 . tl ~ " 1 . 4 II ~ EIr c la4 _ . . . . . . . a ( ~ 0 . 6 - I _ ~ " _ i | | i i o 1o 20 so 40 so eo 70 eo go Time ( min ) 2 ' 1 . 11 . 1JS . ~ ' ~ 1 . 4 1 . , 2 , ~ 0 . 8 .

Invertase secretion by end3 , end4 , and wild - type cells . end3 , end4 , and wild - type cells were grown overnight at 24 ~ in YPUAD containing 5 % glucose . Cultures were then shifted slowly to 37 ~ 10 cain after 37 ~ was reached , cells were harvested and resuspended in media containing 0 . 1 % glucose for invertase induc - tion . At the times indicated , aliquots were withdrawn for assay of total and external invertase activity as described in Materials and Methods . cells were withdrawn , converted to intracellular and ex - traeellular fractions ( Stevens et al . , 1986 ) , and the CPY was precipitated using an anti - CPY antibody . Fluorographs of the 10 % SDS - polyacrylamide gels used to resolve the result - ing immunoprecipitates from the intracellular extracts are shown in Fig . 5 . The rate of appearance of pl , p2 , and mCPY were the same in the three strains . ALl of the pl and p2 CPY could be chased to the mature form . As quantified by den - sitometry a maximum of 13 % of the CPY at any time point Figure 5 . Carboxypeptidase Y biogenesis in end3 , end4 , and wild - type cells , end3 , end4 , and wild - type cells were la - beled for 5 min using H235SO4 at 37 " C and the period of chase was subsequently initiated with addition of ammonium sul - phate , methionine , and cys - teine as described in Materials and Methods . At the times of chase indicated in the figure , aliquots were removed and separated into intracellular and extracellular fractions for immunoprecipita - tion with anti - CPY antibodies . Immunoprecipitates were subse - quently analyzed using SDS - PAGE and fluorography . Only the in - tracellular fractions are shown , pl , the position of the ER precursor form of CPY ; p2 , the position of the Golgi form of CPY ; and M , the position of mature CPY . was found in the extracellular fractions ( data not shown ) . As a control for a mutant that is defective in vacuolar protein sorting , the end / mutant ( Dulic and Riezman , 1989 ) , which is in the same complementation group as vpsll ( Rothman et el . , 1989 ) , was tested in the same assay . No maturation of CPY was detected in the 30 - rain chase period and > 30 % of the p2 CPY was found in the extracellular fraction . The much smaller amounts of CPY found in the external frac - tions in the wild - type , end3 , and end4 cells probably resulted from some lysis during spheroplast preparation because the " external " forms were found irrespective of the time of chase and irrespective of the form ( pl , p2 , or m ) of CPY . In any event , such small amounts of " external " CPY would not be indicative of a defect in vacuolar protein sorting ( Robinson et el . , 1988 ; Rothman and Stevens , 1986 ) . The s - factor InWrnalization Defect in end4 Is Reversible A necessary prerequisite to further characterization of the end4 mutant was to determine whether the endocytic defect present at restrictive temperature could be reversed upon re - turn of end4 cells to permissive temperature . For this experi - ment , the endocytic defect was first installed in end4 by incu - bation at 34 ~ for 10 rain . The preincubated cells were then incubated with 35S - c ~ - factor at 34 ~ for an additional 10 rain and then shifted either to 24 ~ in YPUAD medium or to 24 ~ YPUAD in medium containing cycloheximide . One culture maintained at 34 ~ throughout all steps of the ex - periment provided the control . The results of this experiment are found in Fig . 6 . Even after 90 rain of incubation at 34 ~ end4 cells intenmlized only 20 % of the 35S - c ~ - factor that was bound , end4 cells first preincubated at 340C , then in - cubated with 35S - a - factor at 340C before shift to fresh medium at 240C showed a short , reproducible delay before ultimately internalizing 82 % of the total bound , - factor . Ad - dition of cycloheximide to the cells using this same protocol reduced the amount of internalized a - factor after 90 rain to the control level . Therefore reversibility of the end4 endo - cytic defect requires the synthesis of new protein . Protein synthesis in general , however , is not required for a - factor up - take after a 34 ~ preincubation because wild - type cells treated with cycloheximide internalized a - factor with ki - netics identical to cells which receive no cycloheximide RaChs et el .

Reversibility of the end4 mutation , end4 cells were al - lowed to preincubate for 10 min at 34 ~ 35S - c ~ - factor was added and the incubation continued at 34 ~ for 10 min . After this 10 - rain incubation , the cells were pelleted and resuspended in either 24 ~ medium ( A ) , 34 ~ medium ( e ) , or 24 ~ medium containing cy - cloheximide ( , x ) ( 1 . 4 x 10 - 4 M ) . At the time points indicated ali - quots were withdrawn for processing at pH 6 and pH 1 as described in Materials and Methods . The values represent averages from two experiments . ( data not shown ) . This result supports the idea that the inacti - vation of the end4 mutant protein at restrictive temperature is irreversible . Only newly synthesized End4 protein can re - verse the endocytic defect once installed at restrictive tem - perature in this mutant . The end4 Mutation Affects Only the Earliest Step ( s ) in Internalization and not the Later Delivery of a - factor to the Vacuole The earliest step in the yeast endocytic pathway that can be monitored currently is the conversion of 35S - a - factor from pH 1 wash sensitivity to pH 1 wash insensitivity . Once a - factor is internalized it is delivered to the vacuole where it is subsequently degraded . This last step in the endocytic pathway can be assessed by extraction of internalized 3 ~ S - u - factor and resolution of the degradation products from intact a - factor using a thin layer chromatography system ( Chvatch - ko et al . , 1986 ) . Yet another step in the pathway has been defined by Singer and Riezman ( 1990 ) . Using conditions similar to those found previously in mammalian cells to ar - rest delivery of endocytosed material to lysosomes , they could detect a - factor in an intermediate compartment ( s ) be - tween the cell membrane and the vacuole . Their data showed that when MATa cells were incubated with 35S - u - factor at 15 ~ for 20 min , intact u - factor was recovered as vesicular intermediates en route to the vacuole from the plasma mem - brane . Using this information , we reasoned that if the end4 protein was involved in any of the steps past these 15 ~ inter - mediates , degradation would be blocked in cells allowed first to accumulate u - factor in the 15 ~ compartment ( s ) before shifting to the restrictive temperature . Conversely , a - factor should be degraded in end4 cells if the mutant block pre - cedes the transit of u - factor through the 15 ~ compart - ment ( s ) using this same experimental protocol . Fig . 7 shows the results of an experiment in which the end4 mutant and wild - type cells were first allowed to bind 35S - a - factor for 1 h on ice , then shifted to medium at 15 ~ for 20 min to al - Figure 7 . Degradation of a - factor by end4 and wild - type cells at 37 ~ after accumulation of a - factor in the intermediate compart - ment at 15 ~ end4 and wild - type ceils were allowed to bind 35S - c ~ - factor for 1 h on ice . The cells were pelleted at 4 ~ resuspended in 15 ~ medium , and incubated for 20 rain more at 15 ~ At 20 rain , the cells were pelleted again at 4 ~ and resuspended in medium pre - equilibrated to 34 ~ At the times indicated after 34 ~ shift , aliquots were taken and diluted into pH 6 and pH 1 buffer as described for the measurement of internalization as in Fig . 1 . or - factor degradation ( indicating delivery to the vacuole ) was as - sessed by extracting the cell - associated radioactivity ( see Materials and Methods ) and developing these samples on preparative TLC plates for subsequent fluorography . The positions of intact c ~ - factor ( i ) and the degradation products ( d ) are noted . Values in paren - theses below each pair of lanes indicate the pH 1 / pH 6 ratio of dupli - cate samples taken and processed only for measurement of inter - nalization . low movement of the bound a - factor into the 15 ~ compart - ment ( s ) , before again shifting to 34 ~ to install the end4 mu - tant block . Other experiments have shown that inactivation of end4 at 34 ~ is immediate and therefore no preincubation at the restrictive temperature is required to obtain complete inhibition of endocytosis in this mutant ( data not shown ; see Fig . 7 ) . Aliquots throughout the 34 ~ incubation were taken for extraction of 35S - a - factor and subsequent analysis of degradation by resolution on thin layer chromatography plates . As can be seen from the quantitation of internaliza - tion in this experiment ( Fig . 7 ) internalization of 35S - u - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 120 , 1993 62 factor was arrested immediately upon shift to 34 ~ in the end4 mutant , but continued during the 340C chase in the wild - type strain . The 35S - or - factor that was allowed to bind and then accumulate in the 15 ~ intermediate compart - ment ( s ) in the end4 mutant ( pH 1 resistant ) was degraded with kinetics identical to wild type when shifted to 34 ~ The intact 35S - or - factor that remained associated with end4 cells at pH 6 was bound to the cell surface and not internal - ized because it was dissociated by the pHI treatment . From this experiment we conclude that the mutation in end4 affects only the step ( s ) before or including the formation of the 150C intermediate compartment and not steps involved in the delivery of or - factor from the intermediate compartment ( s ) to the vacuole . Endocytosis Is Not Necessary for Pheromone Response When u - factor binds to its receptor it induces a signal and is rapidly internalized . It has been shown that the receptor need not be internalized to transmit the pheromone signal ( Reneke et al . , 1988 ) . It still remains possible that endocyto - sis of other proteins could play a role in the response . This is now easily testable with the availability of endocytic mu - tants . To test pheromone sensitivity the " halo " assay was used . In this assay MA / h cells are embedded in solid growth medium and disks containing a - factor are placed on top of the agar . The radius of the zone of growth inhibition is logarithmically proportional to the sensitivity of the strain . As can be seen in Table I , end3 cells needed approximately two times less a - factor than end4 or wild - type cells to form the same size halo at 24 ~ At 300C , both end3 and end4 ceils were ~ 2 . 5 times more sensitive to o ~ - factor than wild - type cells . This correlates well with the abilities of the strains to internalize a - factor . At 30 ~ end4 cells are still able to grow , but show an almost complete block in u - factor uptake ( data not shown ) . As this difference in sensitivity is small and both end3 and end4 strains grow more slowly than wild type , we wondered whether small differences in apparent sensitivity could also be explained by the reduced number of ceils . Therefore , we raised and lowered the number of cells embedded in the agar by a factor of 2 . As can be seen in Ta - ble I , when more cells were embedded in the agar the strain appeared less sensitive to a - factor by this test . This differ - ence was less than the effect seen in the end mutants , but indi - cates that the apparent supersensitivity seen in the mutants may be less than was measured . However , it can be con - cluded from these experiments that the end mutants are capa - ble of responding to c ~ - factor and therefore endocytosis is not necessary for pheromone signaling . Discussion By screening an EMS - mutagenized bank for cells unable to internalize a - factor , we have isolated two new yeast endo - cytic mutants , end3 and end4 . Both mutants exhibit ther - mosensitive defects in growth and although both mutants bind a - factor at levels comparable to wild - type ceils , neither mutant internalizes u - factor or its receptor with wild - type characteristics . The end3 mutant does not internalize tx - fac - tor at the permissive growth temperature of 24 ~ or the re - strictive growth temperature of 370C ( Fig . 1 ) . End4 mutants take up ix - factor at permissive temperature , but not at tern - Table I . a - factor Induced Halo Radii ( cm ) Quantity of a - factor Strain and Temperature 10 ng 20 ng 50 ng ~ Wild type 24 1 . 35 1 . 75 2 . 20 Wild type 30 1 . 05 1 . 50 2 . 00 end3 24 1 . 70 2 . 08 2 . 55 end3 30 1 . 70 2 . 10 2 . 55 end4 24 1 . 30 1 . 70 2 . 20 end4 30 1 . 68 1 . 98 2 . 48 1 / 2 x Wild type 24 1 . 32 1 . 85 2 . 62 Wild type 24 1 . 15 1 . 80 2 . 38 2 x Wild type 24 0 . 95 1 . 60 2 . 25 1 / 2 x Wild type 30 0 . 92 1 . 40 2 . 10 Wild type 30 0 . 78 1 . 40 2 . 00 2 x Wild type 30 0 . 60 1 . 25 1 . 85 peratures > 34 ~ Both mutants show some or - factor - depen - dent receptor clearance at permissive temperature with end4 ceils clearing somewhat more receptor activity than end3 cells , but do not show any clearance at 35 ~ The accumula - tion of LY by end3 and end4 mutants mirrors their or - factor - dependent receptor clearance characteristics , end3 strains are very defective for vacuolar LY accumulation at any tem - perature ( Fig . 3 ) . End4 strains accumulate LY in the vacuole in more ceils at 24 than at 37 ~ There are apparent quantita - tive differences between the results of the or - factor internal - ization assays and the oL - factor receptor clearance assays for the end4 mutant . This could be explained in the following manner : In the a - factor internalization assay only a small percentage of receptors were occupied ( < 10 % as calculated from the a - factor concentration and the receptor K ~ ) and therefore triggered to undergo endocytosis . If the pathway was only slightly active ( e . g . , 10 % of wild - type efficiency ) , but the small number of receptors could be efficiently tar - geted into the pathway only a relatively small defect would have been seen . In the receptor clearance assay , we examined the location of all of the or - factor receptors which had been saturated with pheromone . In this case , the large number of receptors to be internalized were not able to be completely loaded into the defective pathway . This interpretation would also be applicable to the LY accumulation experiments . The end4 mutant was apparently more defective for LY accumu - lation than for or - factor uptake . The LY accumulation assay measures net nonspecific endocytic uptake and if the path - way functions at a low efficiency only a small amount of ac - cumulation would occur . In any event it is clear that both mu - tants are defective for endocytosis and that the end4 mutant shows some endocytic capacity at 24 ~ These are the first two endocytic mutants to show both a - factor internalization , receptor clearance and LY accumulation defects and there - fore indicate that common proteins service the entry of fluid - phase and receptor borne markers in yeast . Economy of function also appears to operate among par - ticipants of the secretory and endocytic pathways in yeast . One protein , Sec18p , the yeast homologue of the N - ethylma - leimide - sensitive fusion protein ( NSF ) ( N - ethylmaleimide - sensitive fusion protein ) , functions directly in both path - ways . NSF is necessary for intra - Golgi transport , ER to Golgi transport , and endosome fusion as shown from in vitro assays using mammalian ceil extracts ( Wilson et al . , 1989 ; Paths et al . Yeast Endocytosis Mutants 63 Beckers et al . , 1989 ; Dlaz et al . , 1989 ) . In vivo , the SEC18 gene has been shown to be essential for ER - Golgi transport , transport events within the Golgi , and for delivery of endo - cytic content and a - factor to the vacuole ( Novick et al . , 1980 ; Graham and Emr , 1991 ; Riezman , 1985 ; Riezman et al . , 1992 ) . In addition , evidence has been provided suggest - ing that endocytosis may be obligatorily coupled with the latest steps of secretion . It was postulated that the latter steps of the secretory pathway could be used to replenish compo - nents needed at the plasma membrane for endocytosis ( Riez - man , 1985 ) . Our results show that the secretory pathway is not obligatorily coupled to the endocytic pathway . Invertase secretion and maturation of CPY are not blocked in the end mutants at restrictive temperatures . Furthermore , the endo - cytic defect in the end3 mutant is manifested at the restrictive temperature as well as the permissive temperature . Since cells cannot grow without the secretory pathway the end3 mutant cannot be blocked in secretion . This , however , does not mean that proteins used in the secretory pathway ( in fu - sion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane ) are not recycled for reuse via endocytosis . Even if their recycling was blocked , another port of entry into this pathway exists from newly synthesized material . This is not the case for a potential transmembrane protein required at the cell surface for endocytosis . Its only port of entry to the plasma mem - brane is via the secretory pathway and ff the latter steps of this pathway are blocked this could lead to a slow down or stop of endocytosis . Our findings suggest that endocytosis may be obligatory for cell growth at 37 ~ but not 24 ~ in yeast and show that under certain conditions yeast cells can grow and divide with considerably reduced endocytosis . There are different possible explanations for these observa - tions . Perhaps endocytic uptake is necessary for the removal of heat denatured proteins from the plasma membrane for subsequent degradation in the vacuole . Another explanation could be that without endocytosis a membrane imbalance is generated when secretion rates get too high . The endocytic defect in end4 cells shows some tempera - ture sensitivity . All three measures of endocytosis , oefactor uptake , receptor clearance , and LY accumulation , although to varying degrees suggest that the End4 mutant protein is a temperature - sensitive protein that is partially functional at 24 ~ but is rendered irreversibly inactive at 34 ~ Mapping and elucidation of the specific mutation in end4 could pro - vide interesting information concerning the functional do - mains of this protein . Identification of conditions stalling a - factor while in tran - sit from plasma membrane to vacuole by Singer et al . ( 1990 ) allowed the end4 mutant block to be placed temporally within the endocytic pathway . By binding a - factor under conditions where no internalization occurs and subsequently shifting cells to 15 ~ for 20 min to allow uptake , internal - ized but undegraded a - factor can be recovered in membrane - bounded intermediate compartments ( Singer and Riezman , 1990 ) . Upon shift from 15 ~ to higher temperatures in wild - type cells , this undegraded a - factor can be chased into degraded a - factor indicating delivery of the ligand to the vacuole . The same results are found when end4 cells , al - lowed to internalize a - factor at 15 ~ for 20 min ~ are shifted to restrictive temperature and assayed for degradation ( Fig . 7 ) . Transit of a - factor from the 15 ~ compartment to the vacuole is not affected by the end4 mutation since degrada - tion occurs normally when cells are shifted from 15 ~ to the restrictive temperature . The total amount of o ~ - factor inter - nalized as indicated quantitatively by the pH 1 / pH 6 ratios in parentheses below the lanes and qualitatively by the con - sistent amount of a - factor seen in the pH 6 lanes of Fig . 7 , changes very little once end4 cells are shifted from 15 to 34 ~ This provides a nice internal control for the presence of the endocytic defect throughout this experiment and dis - pels the possible criticism that without an immediate block in internalization a - factor could continue to leak through the pathway resulting in a false positive . END4 , therefore , must act exclusively at the earliest step ( s ) of the internalization pathway , including or preceding the formation of the 15 ~ intermediate , and not the later steps involving the transit of a - factor from the 15 ~ compartment to the vacuole . In addi - tion , its role in the endocytic pathway must be rather direct because no preincubation at nonpermissive temperature is needed to install the phenotype . We believe the data presented in this paper conclusively demonstrate that end3 and end4 are the first yeast endocytic mutants defective in the earliest step ( s ) of the internalization process . Another yeast mutant that shows a partial defect in , - factor uptake is the clathrin heavy chain mutant ( chd ; Payne et al . , 1988 ) . A chd mutant completely lacking clathrin heavy chain was still capable of intenudizing , - fac - tor with , ~ 35 - 50 % efficiency . Therefore , the clathrin heavy chain seems to be less essential for endocytic uptake in yeast than the proteins defined by the END3 and END4 genes . The cloning of these genes and further characterization of these mutants should lead to identification of proteins that are es - sential for the endocytic pathway and hopefully expand our understanding of the mechanism of the early steps of endocy - tosis . The demonstration that a - factor trapped along the en - docytic pathway at nonpermissive temperature in the end4 mutant can be chased into the cell at permissive temperature suggests that the a - factor was not diverted off the normal en - docytic route . This block in endocytic transport could help identify new intermediates in the process and might aid in identifying proteins that interact with the trapped a - factor receptor .
