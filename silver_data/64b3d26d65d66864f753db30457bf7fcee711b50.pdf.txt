Findings suggest that electrostatic contacts , particularly those between K326 , K328 , and R147 on actin and tropomyosin , establish an energetically favorable F - actin - tropomyosin conﬁg - uration , with tropomyosin positioned in a location that impedes actomyosin associations and pro - motes relaxation . Here , we provide data that directly support a vital role for these actin residues , termed the A - triad , in tropomyosin positioning in intact functioning muscle . By examining the effects of an A295S a - cardiac actin hypertrophic cardiomyopa - thy - causing mutation , over a range of increasingly complex in silico , in vitro , and in vivo Drosophila muscle models , we propose that subtle A - triad - tropomyosin perturbation can destabilize thin ﬁla - ment regulation , which leads to hypercontractility and triggers disease . Our efforts increase under - standing of basic thin ﬁlament biology and help unravel the mechanistic basis of a complex cardiac disorder . INTRODUCTION Striated muscle contraction results from transient interactions between myosin - containing thick and actin - containing thin ﬁla - ments . Contractile regulation , throughout the animal kingdom , is achieved by Ca 2 + - dependent modulation of myosin cross - bridge cycling on actin by the thin ﬁlament troponin - tropomyosin complex ( Lehman et al . , 1994 ; Tobacman , 1996 ; Cammarato et al . , 2004 ; Lehman , 2016 ) . The complex consists of an elon - gated tropomyosin ( Tm ) dimer and the troponin C ( TnC , calcium binding ) , troponin I ( TnI , inhibitory ) , and troponin T ( TnT , Tm binding ) subunits of troponin ( Tn ) . Tm is a modular protein con - sisting of seven tandem pseudo - repeating motifs designed to bind seven successive actin monomers along the thin ﬁlament ( Brown et al . , 2005 ; Hitchcock - DeGregori , 2008 ; Li et al . , 2011 ) . The continuous Tn - Tm complexes adopt various states characterized by different average Tm positions that govern the access of myosin binding sites and hence force production ( Tobacman , 1996 ; Lehman , 2016 ) . Under low Ca 2 + conditions , TnI binds to actin and constrains Tn - Tm to the B state , in which Tm sterically blocks and limits myosin binding . Upon activation , Ca 2 + binds to TnC , which triggers TnI release from actin and Tm movement away from myosin binding sites , resulting in the C state . Initial myosin binding further displaces Tm , which in - creases myosin accessibility along actin to establish the open ( M ) state and promotes cooperative activation of contraction . Tm can oscillate dynamically between the states at all Ca 2 + levels , and it is the average azimuthal location of this equilibrium that is normally determined by Tn , Ca 2 + , and myosin ( McKillop and Geeves , 1993 ; Maytum et al . , 2003 ; Pirani et al . , 2005 ) . The association of Tm with actin is largely electrostatic ( Brown et al . , 2005 ; Li et al . , 2011 ; Barua et al . , 2013 ) . Models of ﬁlamen - tous actin and Tm ( F - actin - Tm ) , in the absence of Tn ( i . e . , the A state ) , have been proposed based on molecular evolutionary and mutational analysis , computational chemistry , and electron microscopy ( EM ) reconstructions ( Barua et al . , 2011 , 2013 ; Li et al . , 2011 ; von der Ecken et al . , 2015 ) . These models deﬁne a conserved F - actin - Tm binding interface that is characterized by clusters of charged residues on F - actin , which make favor - able contacts with each consecutive Tm pseudo - repeat . The electrostatic interactions place the dimer in a location that is close to its B - state position on regulated F - actin - Tn - Tm ﬁla - ments when pinned down by TnI at low Ca 2 + and establish an energetically stable conformation ( Li et al . , 2011 ; Barua et al . , 2013 ; Lehman et al . , 2013 ) . In particular , K326 , K328 , and R147 on actin appear to interact with acidic residues of each repetitive motif along Tm’s entire length , associations that in muscle are likely essential for helping establish an energy basin to bias Tm to an inhibitory position ( Orzechowski et al . , 2014 ) . Because precisely coordinated communication among indi - vidual components is compulsory for proper contractile regula - tion , it follows that mutations at or near thin ﬁlament subunit interfaces can disrupt its function and initiate myopathy . For example , the loci of many of the (cid:1) 100 thin ﬁlament mutations that cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) are found 2612 Cell Reports 20 , 2612 – 2625 , September 12 , 2017 ª 2017 The Authors . This is an open access article under the CC BY - NC - ND license ( http : / / creativecommons . org / licenses / by - nc - nd / 4 . 0 / ) . at intermolecular surfaces ( Tardiff , 2011 ) . HCM is a clinically diverse , autosomal dominant disease of cardiac muscle that afﬂicts 1 : 500 of the general population ( Maron , 2002 ) . It is char - acterized by abnormal thickening of the heart , myocellular disarray , arrhythmias , and altered Ca 2 + homeostasis . However , the earliest signs of disease are hyperdynamic contractile properties and diastolic dysfunction , which precede ventricular hypertrophy and have been shown to be essential for HCM pathobiology ( Green et al . , 2016 ) . Diastolic dysfunction is asso - ciated with elevated ﬁlling pressures due to impaired relaxation and increased myocardial stiffness ( Kass et al . , 2004 ; Campbell and Sorrell , 2015 ) . In 1999 , the ﬁrst a - cardiac actin ( ACTC1 ) mutation linked to HCM was reported ( Mogensen et al . , 1999 ) . Expression of the ACTC1 A295S variant engendered highly penetrant yet heterogeneous disease phenotypes among family members . Only one of 13 individuals was asymptomatic , whereas nine were phenotypically assigned with major HCM and three were phenotypically assigned with minor HCM . Despite its identiﬁ - cation nearly two decades ago , efforts to characterize A295S actin have been limited and failed to resolve any disruptions in in vitro transcription and / or translation , folding efﬁciency , or actomyosin ATPase activity of mutant proteins ( Vang et al . , 2005 ; Dahari and Dawson , 2015 ) . Overall , such clinical hetero - geneity , the absence of mutation - induced in vitro effects , and a lack of animal models limits meaningful genotype - phenotype correlations for predicting patient outcomes and our under - standing of the molecular basis of disease ( Tardiff , 2011 ) . However , model organisms that minimize confounding genetic and environmental factors to curtail phenotypic variability , and permit analysis from the molecular through the organ level , can help resolve the intricate origins of myopathies . Here , we used Drosophila melanogaster as our primary exper - imental model for comprehensive in vivo , in situ , in vitro , and in silico analysis of the ACTC1 A295S HCM - causing mutation . We tested the hypothesis that the mutation perturbs critical associations between nearby actin residues K326 , K328 , and R147 , termed the A - triad , and Tm , which disrupts contractile inhibition , stimulates hyperdynamic and excessive tension generation , and consequently initiates disease . The variant would therefore be expected to yield a molecular phenotype characterized by inadequate Tm - based blocking of myosin bind - ing on thin ﬁlaments . When expressed in the ﬂy heart , A295S mutant actin signiﬁcantly decreased cardiac output , prolonged systolic intervals , and elicited diastolic dysfunction by increasing actively cycling cross - bridges without affecting the resting cellular Ca 2 + milieu . A295S actin expression in the indirect ﬂight muscle ( IFM ) also induced hypercontraction and enhanced Ca 2 + sensitivity of reconstituted thin ﬁlament sliding . Computational modeling indicated that the ACTC1 A295S HCM mutation changed the orientation of A - triad residues and their interac - tions with Tm , which would destabilize the energetically favored inhibitory A / B state and may bias Tm toward the C - state conﬁg - uration . Demonstration that possible subtle changes in F - actin - Tm interactions promote discernable contractile disinhibition emphasizes the value of Drosophila models for providing a mechanistic basis for proximal causes of myocardial disease . Thus , our efforts increase understanding of basic thin ﬁlament biology and help elucidate the pathogenesis of a complex car - diac disorder . RESULTS The A295S Mutation Resides Proximal to the Highly Conserved Actin A - Triad Human and Drosophila actins are encoded by six highly homol - ogous genes . As found in vertebrates , ﬂies express cardiac and skeletal muscle - speciﬁc isoforms . Act57B is one of two sarco - meric actin genes expressed in the adult ﬂy heart , while Act88F encodes all sarcomeric actin of the IFM ( Cammarato et al . , 2011a ; Shah et al . , 2011 ; Hiromi and Hotta , 1985 ) . The car - diac and skeletal isoforms differ in only a few amino acids within and between species ( Figure 1A ) . K326 , K328 , and R147 , which based on F - actin - Tm models , make multiple favorable electro - static contacts with Tm , are exceptionally well conserved . Anal - ysis of more than 800 actin sequences , from vertebrates and invertebrates , revealed 100 % ﬁdelity of these basic residues ( Figure S1 ) . This supports a vital role for these amino acids in actin function and potentially , in striated muscle thin ﬁlaments , in Tn - Tm - mediated regulation of contraction . To emphasize the importance of these residues in establishing the A state of F - actin - Tm and , in principle , in contractile regulation of striated muscle , we have designated these amino acids as the A - triad . A295 is centered just behind the A - triad in the actin subunit structure ( Figure 1B ) . Therefore , amino acid substitutions at this locus may induce propagated effects that inﬂuence the association of the A - triad with corresponding residues along Tm and inﬂuence its capacity to impede myosin binding . A295S Actin Incorporates Uniformly along Drosophila Cardiac Thin Filaments Drosophila has a linear cardiac tube that consists of a single layer of cardiomyocytes and is highly reminiscent of the primitive vertebrate embryonic heart ( Figure 2A ) ( Miller , 1950 ) . The relative simplicity of the ﬂy heart , combined with an array of tools to manipulate the ﬂy genome , provide unique opportunities to examine how thin ﬁlament mutations affect cardiac muscle and drive disease . Using the PhiC31 integrase system ( Groth et al . , 2004 ) , we generated several transgenic lines that permit exami - nation of the muscle - speciﬁc effects of wild - type versus A295S mutant actin expression at multiple levels . PhiC31 - mediated transgenesis ensured each gene integrated at an identical , pre - determined genomic location . Thus , our results are directly com - parable and phenotypic differences in control versus mutant ﬂies were immediately attributed to the single amino acid substitution in actin . Heart - speciﬁc expression of transgenes was achieved via the Gal4 - upstream activating sequence ( UAS ) expression system ( Brand and Perrimon , 1993 ) . Flies harboring the Hand 4 . 2 - Gal4 driver were crossed with ﬂies containing constructs consisting of an UAS followed by an Act57B transgene . The progenies inherit both genes and express the UAS - Act57B transgene exclusively in the cardiac tube , which was conﬁrmed by direct visualization of ﬂuo - rescent signals from Hand 4 . 2 - Gal4 > UAS - Act57B GFP . WT ( abbr . Hand > Act57B GFP . WT ) ﬂies ( Figure 2A ) . Closer examina - tion revealed clear , striated GFP signals from the hearts of Cell Reports 20 , 2612 – 2625 , September 12 , 2017 2613 Hand > Act57B GFP . WT and Hand > Act57B GFP .

At 100 3 magniﬁcation , GFP signals from both lines were seen overlapping congruently with tetramethylr - hodamine ( TRITC ) - phalloidin actin signals ( Figures 2C and 2D ) . Act57B GFP .

The ACTC1 A295S HCM Mutation Induces Cardiomyopathy in Drosophila High - speed video microscopy and semi - automated motion analysis were used to investigate the consequences of the HCM actin mutation on Drosophila cardiac tubes . We analyzed beating hearts of females expressing UAS - Act57B WT versus UAS - Act57B A295S transgenes that lacked GFP to eliminate confounding effects caused by the N - terminally located moiety ( Figure S2A ) . M - mode kymograms , which illustrate heart wall movement over time , suggested mutation - induced alterations in cardiac dimensions and contractile dynamics in three - week - old ﬂies ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . Hand > Act57B A295S hearts were characterized by restricted diameters and prolonged systolic periods relative to controls . We quantiﬁed the effects of Act57B A295S mutant actin expres - sion on several cardiac parameters relative to wild - type actin expression and to endogenous actin expression in non - trans - genic controls ( the progeny of Hand 3 yw ) , from one through seven weeks of age ( Figure 3C ; Table S1 ) . As shown previously , cardiac output , diastolic and systolic diameters , and fractional shortening progressively decreased among all genotypes over time ( Blice - Baum et al . , 2017 ) . However , Hand > Act57B A295S Drosophila exhibited signiﬁcantly diminished output relative to controls . This reduction was due to restricted diastolic and sys - tolic diameters . Moreover , the effect of mutant actin expression on diastolic diameters was greater than that on systolic diame - ters , which resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in fractional shortening versus controls . Overall , as observed in a cohort of HCM patients with myosin or TnI mutations ( Kubo et al . , 2007 ) , Hand > Act57B A295S hearts demonstrated a restrictive pheno - type and were unable to adequately relax during diastole . We also evaluated the myogenic cardiac contractile dy - namics for Hand > Act57B A295S relative to Hand > Act57B WT Figure 1 .

The heart period , which is the combined length of time required for a single diastolic and ensuing systolic event of the cardiac cycle , signiﬁcantly increased with age for all lines but did not differ among geno - types ( Figure 3C ) . However , normalization of the systolic interval to the heart period ( SI / HP ) for each line , which illustrates the proportion of time spent generating active tension during the cardiac cycle , revealed the A295S actin mutation induced an increase in the SI / HP ratio relative to controls at all ages . Thus , analogous to what is seen during early stages of HCM , which are characterized by diastolic dysfunction and hyper - dynamic contractile properties ( Green et al . , 2016 ) , the A295S actin mutation perturbs the heart’s ability to reestablish resting diastolic volumes and it prolongs tension - generating periods . All preceding ﬁndings were veriﬁed using a second , indepen - dent pair of transgenic Drosophila lines ( Figures S2B and S2C ; Table S2 ) . A295S Actin Reduces Heart Diameters during Diastole by Increasing Ca 2 + - Independent Actomyosin Associations Altered Ca 2 + homeostasis is frequently observed in HCM , and diastolic dysfunction , a hallmark of HCM , can be partly attrib - uted to elevated diastolic Ca 2 + levels that promote actomyosin associations and impair relaxation . The inherent nature of the Drosophila heart tube , which is formed by opposing rows of cardiomyocytes joined by intercellular junctions ( Miller , 1950 ) , provides unique opportunities to assess diastolic properties with single - cell resolution , in situ , in the native context of the functioning organ ( Viswanathan et al . , 2014 ; Kaushik et al . , 2015 ) . To determine a contribution of potentially elevated dia - stolic Ca 2 + to shortened Hand > Act57B A295S myocytes and thus to reduced cardiac diameters , we incubated live hearts of all genotypes in a solution containing 10 mM EGTA and 100 m M EGTA , AM . EGTA , AM is a cell - permeant acetoxymethyl ester of the Ca 2 + chelator EGTA , which passively enters cells , is hydrolyzed by intracellular esterases , and produces EGTA . Upon EGTA / EGTA , AM incubation , rhythmic contractions ceased ( Figure 4A ) . Relative to those established during diastole , all lines experienced a slight yet signiﬁcant (cid:1) 2 . 5 % increase in di - ameters upon chelation of extra - and intracellular Ca 2 + ( Figures 4B and 4C ) . Therefore , minor amounts of intracellular diastolic Ca 2 + likely trigger actomyosin interactions and produce slightly contracted cardiomyocytes . Comparison of the responses ( Figure 4C ) , however , revealed no signiﬁcant difference in the average change in cardiac diameters among Hand 3 yw ( D = 1 . 70 ± 0 . 08 m m ) , Hand > Act57B WT ( D = 1 . 88 ± 0 . 09 m m ) , and Hand > Act57B A295S ( D = 1 . 85 ± 0 . 06 m m ) . This implies that a similar diastolic Ca 2 + level is shared among the genotypes , which contributes equally to resting tension , and that the signif - icantly restricted Hand > Act57B A295S heart diameters do not result from elevated resting Ca 2 + causing excessive myocyte Figure 2 .

Unperturbed Ca 2 + handling was also supported by qPCR analysis ( Figure S3 ) , which revealed no differences in transcript levels of L - type Ca 2 + channels , ryanodine recep - tors , sarco / endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase ( SERCA ) , Na + / Ca 2 + exchangers , or inositol triphosphate ( IP 3 ) receptors between the lines . Thus , the cardiomyocyte Ca 2 + - handling biosignature appeared normal following Act57B A295S actin expression . Blebbistatin , asmall - moleculeinhibitorofseveralstriatedmus - cle myosins , impedes actomyosin interaction in cardiac prepara - tions from multiple species , including ﬂies ( Fedorov et al . , 2007 ; Viswanathan et al . , 2014 ) . Subsequent analysis veriﬁed that the addition of blebbistatin to EGTA / EGTA , AM - treated hearts evoked a second signiﬁcant increase in diameters across the wallofallgenotypes ( Figure4B ) . Thissuggeststhattheinitialche - lation of intracellular Ca 2 + does not induce complete relaxation of Drosophila cardiomyocytesandthatundersuchCa 2 + - freecondi - tions , Tm - based steric prevention of actomyosin interactions is incomplete . Hence , in addition to those stimulated by trace amounts of free Ca 2 + , a small population of residual cross - bridges is actively cycling , generating force , reducing cardio - myocyte length , and establishing basal myocardial tone during diastole . To evaluate the relative proportion of these Ca 2 + - inde - pendent , unimpeded , force - generating , diastolic cross - bridges , wecomparedtheblebbistatin - induceddiameterchangesamong all lines . The average cardiac diameters for Hand 3 yw and Hand > Act57B WT following blebbistatin treatment were (cid:1) 2 % greater ( D = 1 . 61 ± 0 . 05 and 1 . 72 ± 0 . 10 m m , respectively ) than those determined during EGTA / EGTA , AM incubation ( Figures 4B – 4D ) . However , the average cardiac diameter for Hand > Act57B A295S following blebbistatin treatment was (cid:1) 8 % greater ( D = 5 . 47 ± 0 . 26 m m ) thanthatdeterminedduringEGTA / EGTA , AM incubation ( Figures 4B – 4D ) . Comparing the diameter changes among the genotypes ( Figure 4D ) revealed the response to bleb - bistatin was signiﬁcantly greater for Hand > Act57B A295S hearts relative to that for controls . These observations are consistent with diastolic dysfunction and restrictive physiology that are unrelated to resting Ca 2 + levels but rather due to excessively disinhibited Ca 2 + - independent cross - bridge cycling , enhanced basal tension , and incomplete relaxation for Hand > Act57B A295S mutant hearts . Thus , the A295S actin mutation could destabilize Tm positioning such that it inadequately blocks myosin binding at rest , causing excessive tension and myocyte shortening that restricts proper ﬁlling , even in the absence of disrupted Ca 2 + handling . A295S Actin Impairs Drosophila Flight Ability and Promotes Skeletal Muscle Hypercontraction Drosophila IFMs are well suited for mechanical and structural analyses , are exquisitely sensitive to sarcomeric mutations , Figure 3 .

Data are presented as mean ± SEM ( n = 35 – 46 for each genotype and age group ) .

To study the effects of the HCM mutation on the IFM , we created Act88F WT and Act88F A295S transgenic ﬂies . Different doses of transgenic versus endogenous actin were achieved by back - crossing the transgene into a ﬂightless , Act88F null strain . Compared to w 1118 non - transgenic and Act88F WT / + controls , Act88F A295S / + heterozygous ﬂies showed a slight but signiﬁcant decrease in ﬂight ability , as determined by standard metrics ( Fig - ure S4A ) . The capacity for typical upward ﬂight appeared blunted in the mutants . Act88F WT / + Drosophila also displayed modest ﬂight impairment relative to w 1118 . To enhance our ability to characterize organismal behavior , we employed digital inline holography to comprehensively phenotype ﬂight kinematics ( Figure S5 ) . We computed three - dimensional trajectories for ascending w 1118 , Act88F WT / + , and Act88F A295S / + Drosophila and compared free - ﬂying velocity and acceleration parameters ( Figure 5A ) . Both Act88F WT / + ( 0 . 42 ± 0 . 01 m / s , 27 . 02 ± 1 . 15 rad / s ) and Act88F A295S / + ( 0 . 36 ± 0 . 02 m / s , 22 . 90 ± 1 . 40 rad / s ) transgenic lines displayed signiﬁcantly lower overall and angular velocities relative to w 1118 ( 0 . 45 ± 0 . 01 m / s , 31 . 51 ± 1 . 22 rad / s ) ( Figure 5B ) . However , Act88F A295S / + ( 3 . 38 ± 0 . 32 m / s 2 ) exhibited signiﬁcantly reduced acceleration relative to both Act88F WT / + ( 4 . 60 ± 0 . 26 m / s 2 ) and w 1118 ( 5 . 00 ± 0 . 27 m / s 2 ) . Likewise , centripetal acceleration for Act88F A295S / + ( 8 . 43 ± 0 . 74 m / s 2 ) was signiﬁcantly lower than that for Act88F WT / + ( 11 . 38 ± 0 . 57 m / s 2 ) and w 1118 ( 14 . 48 ± 0 . 68 m / s 2 ) . Moreover , because the body weights of all geno - types were identical ( Figure S4B ) , and given that the mutants ex - hibited reduced acceleration , A295S actin expression appears to compromise the amount of IFM force development during upward ﬂight . Despite clear ﬂight impairment for Act88F A295S / + heterozygotes , no discernable gross morphological disruptions were observed in their IFMs , relative to w 1118 and Act88F WT / + , that could account for the altered behavior ( Figure 6A ) . Homozygous expression of wild - type transgenic actin in Act88F WT / Act88F WT Drosophila did not rescue the ﬂightless phenotype associated with the Act88F null strain ( Figure S4A ) , potentially due to an insufﬁcient degree of transgene expres - sion ( Beall et al . , 1989 ) . IFM development and morphology , however , were indistinguishable between Act88F WT / Act88F WT and w 1118 non - transgenic controls ( Figure 6A ) . Act88F A295S / Act88F A295S Drosophila were similarly ﬂightless ( Figure S4A ) , yet their IFMs exhibited destructive hypercontraction ( Figure 6A ) , a well - characterized phenotype that results from excessive and / or unregulated force generation ( Beall and Fyrberg , 1991 ; Cam - marato et al . , 2004 ; Viswanathan et al . , 2014 ) . This degenerative disorder was observed with 100 % penetrance in Act88F A295S / Act88F A295S homozygotes , where all endogenous wild - type IFM actin was replaced by the mutant variant , a ﬁnding consistent with impaired Tm - based inhibition of actomyosin interactions . In an attempt to discern the mechanistic root of ACTC1 - based cardiomyopathies , differences in the intrinsic biophysical prop - erties of mutant actins , including folding and polymerization characteristics , have been investigated ( Vang et al . , 2005 ; Mun - dia et al . , 2012 ; Muller et al . , 2012 ) . Despite a lack of supportive in vitro evidence , the A295S substitution was predicted to alter actin stability and / or polymerization properties ( Muller et al . , 2012 ; Mundia et al . , 2012 ) , which in vivo , could result in aberrant thin ﬁlament lengths . Thin ﬁlament length is an important deter - minant of force production ( de Winter et al . , 2016 ) . Mutations in skeletal muscle a - actin ACTA1 that cause nemaline myopathy Figure 4 .

( B ) Signiﬁcant , incremental increases in cardiac diameters were veriﬁed for all genotypes following extra - and intracellular Ca 2 + chelation and upon blebbistatin incubation . ( C ) The average change in diameter across the heart wall in response to EGTA / EGTA , AM was similar among all lines . ( D ) Blebbistatin treatment prompted a signiﬁcantly greater response across the wall of Hand > Act57B A295S hearts relative to that observed for Hand 3 yw and Hand > Act57B WT hearts .

Cell Reports 20 , 2612 – 2625 , September 12 , 2017 2617 have been shown to alter thin ﬁlament length and force gen - eration . Altered ﬁlament lengths may therefore contribute to the pathogenesis of A295S - mediated HCM . We measured thin ﬁlament lengths from confocal micrographs of TRITC - phalloi - din - labeled IFM myoﬁbrils ( Figure S4C ) . Average thin ﬁlament length from two - day - old w 1118 ( 1 . 38 ± 0 . 01 m m ) , Act88F WT / + ( 1 . 39 ± 0 . 01 m m ) , Act88F A295S / + ( 1 . 39 ± 0 . 01 m m ) , Act88F WT / Act88F WT ( 1 . 39 ± 0 . 01 m m ) , and Act88F A295S / Act88F A295S ( 1 . 41 ± 0 . 01 m m ) Drosophila did not signiﬁcantly differ ( Figure 6B ) . These results were corroborated visually by image averaging of the TRITC - phalloidin actin signals from randomly selected IFM sarcomeres of each genotype ( Figure 6C ) , and they are consis - tent with unimpaired thin ﬁlament formation and stability , in vivo , irrespective of actin variant dose . Thus , disrupted thin ﬁlament length is likely not a contributing factor to ACTC1 A295S - medi - ated pathology . The A295S Actin Mutation Enhances Thin Filament Ca 2 + Sensitivity To investigate the impact of the HCM mutation on molecular per - formance , homogeneous populations of transgenic actin were puriﬁed from the IFMs of Act88F WT / Act88F WT and Act88F A295S / Act88F A295S Drosophila ( Razzaq et al . , 1999 ) . Fluorescently labeled F - actin movement over immobilized rabbit skeletal myosin was studied in an in vitro motility assay ( Kron and Spudich , 1986 ) . Unregulated velocities for Act88F WT ( 2 . 77 ± 0 . 08 m m / s ) and Act88F A295S ( 2 . 80 ± 0 . 04 m m / s ) F - actin were iden - tical ( Figure 7A ) , which suggests the A295S lesion does not overtlyinﬂuenceactomyosinassociations . Wenextreconstituted thin ﬁlaments using bovine cardiac Tn - Tm , in conjunction with rabbit skeletal , Act88F WT , or Act88F A295S actin , to resolve poten - tial differences in regulated motility ( Liang et al . , 2003 ) . As previ - ously reported , motility parameters of rabbit and Act88F WT F - actin and reconstituted thin ﬁlaments were indistinguishable ( Figure S6 ) ( Bing et al . , 1998 ) , which justiﬁes the use of IFM actin for investigating the molecular effects of human disease - causing mutations . Reconstituted Act88F A295S thin ﬁlaments showed a leftward shift in the velocity : pCa ( – log 10 of the calcium concen - tration ) relationship relative to Act88F WT thin ﬁlaments ( Fig - ures 7B and 7C ) . The half - maximal pCa 50 activation value was signiﬁcantly higher forAct88F A295S ( 6 . 23 ± 0 . 03 ) versus Act88F WT ( 6 . 09 ± 0 . 05 ) regulated thin ﬁlaments , consistent with increased Ca 2 + sensitivity . No signiﬁcant differences , however , were observed in maximal sliding speed ( 3 . 26 ± 0 . 08 versus 3 . 23 ± 0 . 11 m m / s ) or in the cooperativity of Ca 2 + activation ( n , Hill coefﬁ - cient 1 . 77 ± 0 . 24 versus 1 . 26 ± 0 . 16 ) between mutant and control ﬁlaments . These data support an A295S actin - mediated gain in molecular thin ﬁlament function due to disrupted Tn - Tm - medi - ated regulation . The A295S Actin Mutation Shifts the Electrostatic Equilibrium Position of Tropomyosin toward the Closed State An in silico approach was undertaken to identify molecular changes that may account for the hypercontractility of mus - cles and elevated Ca 2 + sensitivity of thin ﬁlaments containing Figure 5 .

Moreover , nodifference inaccelerationduringascendingﬂight wasobserved for w 1118 versus Act88F WT / + , while acceleration for themutant line was signiﬁcantlylower than that forboth .

See also Figures S4 and S5 . 2618 Cell Reports 20 , 2612 – 2625 , September 12 , 2017 A295S actin . Landscapes of the electrostatic interaction energy betweenTmandF - actin , which sampleTmenergies overarange of azimuthal rotations and longitudinal translations around the actin ﬁlament axis , were calculated ( Figure 7D ) . The electrostatic interaction energy landscape for wild - type F - actin - Tm was char - acterized by a broad basin (cid:1) 7 A ˚ high and 8 (cid:3) wide . The basin ex - hibited a predominantly uniform and ﬂat energy distribution . For example , the energy difference between the minimum conﬁgura - tion ( X in Figure 7D ) and that of a previously assigned A / B state ( circle in Figure 7D ) ( Li et al . , 2011 ; Orzechowski et al . , 2014 ) , both of which reside within the broad energy well , is miniscule . ThisimpliesthatintheabsenceofTn , Tmcouldaccessnumerous locations within the basin with little energetic impediment . The A295S actin mutation , however , substantially changed the breadthoftheF - actin - Tmenergetic landscape . Theenergybasin of the mutant was narrower ( (cid:1) 5 A˚ high and 4 (cid:3) wide ) and slightly deeper than that of wild - type , which resulted in a basin approxi - mately 60 % smaller in area . Therefore , Tm likely has fewer locations over the surface of A295S F - actin that are accessible with small energetic impediments . The mutant landscape also predicts that , on average , equilibrium positions of Tm are shifted upward toward the ﬁlament pointed end and azimuthally over the F - actin surface toward the actin inner domain , closer to the C state . The minimized structures show that the total electrostatic energy difference observed between wild - type and mutant F - actin - Tm results from the cumulative effects of several small changes in the interactions of the A - triad with pseudo - repeats along Tm’s entire length ( Figure S7 ; Table S3 ) . For instance , on average , the salt bridges formed between Tm and K328 and K326 on actin are 0 . 58 and 0 . 17 A˚ shorter in the mutant compared to wild - type , respectively ( Table S3 ) . Summation of the individual interaction values among R147 , K326 , and K328 of actin and acidic residues of Tm ( Table S4 ) highlights that these associations , and in particular that of K328 , account for nearly the entire difference in total electrostatic energy between wild - type and A295S F - actin - Tm . This suggests that the A - triad has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on , and is a major determinant of , Tm positioning . The A295S mutation appears to change A - triad - Tm interactions and thus the F - actin - Tm energetic landscape . The characteristic broad and ﬂat energy basin , which helps properly position Tm for effective myosin blocking , is perturbed . Such mutation - induced effects in muscle could promote contractile disinhibition . DISCUSSION The A - triad is an ancient surface feature of actin . It is composed of K326 , K328 , and R147 , which are among a large number of amino acids displaying 100 % sequence identity ( Figure S1 ) . The extreme degree of conservation is believed to result from evolutionary constraints imposed by actin’s interactions with a multitude of binding partners , which specify its function over a range of physiological processes ( Gunning et al . , 2015 ; Pollard , 2016 ) . Here we provide in vivo evidence for a vital role of the A - triad residues in the fundamental process of Tn - Tm - mediated regulation of striated muscle contraction . Previously , energy landscape determinations for Tm posi - tioned over the surface of F - actin revealed the A - triad helps establish a broad energy basin associated with Tm favorably situated to block myosin binding ( Orzechowski et al . , 2014 ) . This conﬁguration is close to that of the B state of Tn - Tm - regu - lated thin ﬁlaments but on average has greater positional variance ( Lehman et al . , 2009 , 2013 ; Orzechowski et al . , 2014 ) . We have now extended the in silico and in vitro ﬁndings and present data that support a direct role for these ground - state A - triad - Tm associations in steric hindrance of actomyosin cross - bridge cycling in the physiological context of muscle . Figure 6 . A295S Actin Promotes Indirect Flight Muscle Hyper - contraction without Altering Thin Filament Length ( A ) The dorsal longitudinal IFMs ( DLMs ) of two - day - old Act88F WT / + and Act88F A295S / + heterozygotes and of Act88F WT / Act88F WT homozygotes were indistinguishable from those of w 1118 controls . Act88F A295S / Act88F A295S ho - mozygotes , however , displayed hypercontracted and torn DLMs . ( B ) The IFM thin ﬁlament lengths did not signiﬁcantly differ among the lines .

Cell Reports 20 , 2612 – 2625 , September 12 , 2017 2619 We propose that in addition to TnI - actin binding , A - triad - Tm contacts are essential for force inhibition and that posttransla - tional modiﬁcations ( Viswanathan et al . , 2015 ) or mutations to or around the A - triad can modulate contraction and can initiate disease . The a [ a ] - cardiac actin A295S substitution , the ﬁrst reported ACTC1 mutation linked to HCM , occurs proximal to the A - triad ( Mogensen et al . , 1999 ) . To unravel its molecular origin , we generated several transgenic Drosophila models of this highly penetrant disease . Our studies rely on technologies that provide distinct advantages over classical methodologies for investi - gating myopathies across a host of scales . While mouse models have been employed for such purposes , confounding genetic modiﬁers and environmental factors can inﬂuence and conceal pathology . For example , the clinical proﬁle associated with the ACTC1 A331P HCM mutation includes ventricular ﬁbrillation , cardiac arrest , repolarization abnormalities , and hypertrophied walls , yet mice expressing the variant showed no phenotypic disruptions or signs of disease ( Olson et al . , 2000 ; Toko et al . , 2010 ) . Although the ﬂy heart is less complex in gross structure relative to that of mammals , the ultrastructural and proteomic makeup are highly conserved ( Cammarato et al . , 2011a ) . Defects in myoﬁlament proteins , a B - crystallin , and the receptor tyrosine kinase pathway result in cardiac phenotypes remarkably similar to those characterized in human cardiomyopathy , suggesting conserved pathological responses also exist in Drosophila and that , accordingly , the ﬂy can serve as an efﬁcient translational disease model ( Viswanathan et al . , 2014 ; Cammarato et al . , 2008 ; Xie et al . , 2013 ; Yu et al . , 2013 ) . Our study employed the powerful Drosophila PhiC31 inte - grase - mediated transgenesis system to create HCM thin ﬁlament mutants ( Groth et al . , 2004 ) . Integrase technology eliminates genetic variability and controls for expression incon - sistency and modifying factors to help elucidate critical geno - type - phenotype information that often eludes other models . In addition , ﬂies permit evaluation of muscle performance from hundreds of animals , with tissue - speciﬁc expression , for excep - tionally well - powered and highly controlled analyses . When expressed in the Drosophila heart , A295S actin incorporated uniformly along the length of thin ﬁlaments , reduced cardiac vol - umes especially at rest , and prolonged the duration of systolic tension development ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . Restricted volumes and Figure 7 . The A295S Actin Mutation Aug - ments Thin Filament Ca 2 + Sensitivity and Distorts the F - Actin - Tropomyosin Energy Landscape ( A ) Act88F WT and Act88F A295S F - actin , propelled byrabbitpsoasmusclemyosin , movedatidentical velocities , which suggests the A295S mutation does not markedly affect actomyosin interactions . Average velocities for each of three biological replicate experiments ( n = 3 ) were determined from20to25ﬁlamentsperexperiment . Bargraphs depict weighted mean velocity ± SEM . ( B ) Act88F WT and Act88F A295S - containing thin ﬁl - aments were reconstituted using bovine cardiac Tn - Tm . Three individual actin preparations were assayed twice ( n = 6 ) , and average velocities at each Ca 2 + concentration , derived from 20 to 25 ﬁlaments per experiment , were pooled , plotted as a function of [ Ca 2 + ] , and ﬁt to the Hill equation . Act88F WT and Act88F A295S thin ﬁlament maximum velocities ( V max ) , derived from the ﬁts , were indistinguishable and used to normalize each pooled ﬁlament velocity . Normalized velocities ± SEM versus corresponding pCa values are presented . ( C ) The pCa 50 of reconstituted thin ﬁlaments was signiﬁcantly higher for Act88F A295S relative to Act88F WT ﬁlaments , indicative of augmented Ca 2 + sensitivity .

The color is scaled as indicated on the right axis . Energy values in each graph are relative to the minimum point in the landscape , which was set to zero .

The minima of the landscapes are denoted with a white X . The position of Tm in the Li et al . ( 2011 ) A / B state is indicated by a white circle for reference ( Orzechowski et al . , 2014 ) . Contours on the plots start at 100 kcal / mol and increase by 200 kcal / mol . See also Figures S6 and S7 and Tables S3 and S4 . 2620 Cell Reports 20 , 2612 – 2625 , September 12 , 2017 extended tension periods are consistent with impaired relaxation and the hyperdynamic contractile properties that precede myocardial hypertrophy ( Green et al . , 2016 ) and that stimulate speciﬁc remodeling cascades ( Davis et al . , 2016 ) . Diastolic dysfunction was further investigated by comparing relaxation responses in cardiac diameters to EGTA / EGTA , AM and subsequently to blebbistatin for control versus mutant hearts ( Figure 4 ) . Changes in diameter are directly proportional to changes in opposing cell lengths . Diastole is normally charac - terized by slightly shortened myocytes with elevated basal stiffness ( Viswanathan et al . , 2014 ) due to minor contributions from Ca 2 + - induced and , apparently , Ca 2 + - independent cross - bridge cycling ( Figure 4 ) . However , our data suggest that the excessively shortened cardiomyocytes in quiescent Hand > Act57B A295S hearts were not the result of elevated diastolic Ca 2 + but rather were due to poor thin ﬁlament blocking of , and a disproportionately heightened number of disinhibited , actively cycling cross - bridges . Heterozygous A295S actin expression in the IFM led to ﬂight impairment , characterized by reduced acceleration ( Figure 5 ) , which was likely secondary to force - induced microscopic dam - age . Such small hypercontractures can compromise perfor - mance at the level of the whole muscle and result in lower total IFM force generation during ﬂight . Homozygous expression caused extensive macroscopic IFM damage and supported a variant - driven ‘‘gain of sarcomeric function , ’’ which resulted in a total lack of force production at the organismal level . The ﬁ - bers were torn apart and displayed the typical hypercontraction phenotype ( Figure 6 ) associated with thin ﬁlament mutations that weaken Tm’s ability to effectively block myosin cross - bridge cycling ( Beall and Fyrberg , 1991 ; Cammarato et al . , 2004 ; Viswanathan et al . , 2014 ) . The A295S actin mutation did not inﬂuence in vivo thin ﬁlament lengths or maximum F - actin sliding velocity ( Figures 6 and 7 ) . These ﬁndings suggest that changes in force due to aberrant ﬁlament lengths or , as originally proposed , directly due to molecular deﬁciencies in actomyosin interactions ( Mogensen et al . , 1999 ) are not primary determinants of pathology . However , A295S - containing thin ﬁlaments , reconstituted from Drosophila actin and vertebrate cardiac Tn - Tm , displayed a signiﬁcant increase in Ca 2 + sensi - tivity , which is consistent with other HCM - inducing thin ﬁlament lesions ( Tardiff , 2011 ) and with pathogenesis linked to impaired contractile regulation . Disease - causing mutations frequently occur in residues at the F - actin - Tm interface . Such mutations likely interfere with electrostatic interactions between the proteins and distort the normal thin ﬁlament energy landscape . Because Tm loca - tion on F - actin is not ﬁxed and can oscillate among the A / B , C , and M positions in either the absence or the presence of Ca 2 + , low - energy barriers are believed to separate distinct energy minima associated with each thin ﬁlament regulatory state ( McKillop and Geeves , 1993 ; Maytum et al . , 2003 ; Pirani et al . , 2005 ) . Therefore , relatively minor changes in surface interactions between F - actin and Tm could effectively alter these barriers to dramatically tip the balance between regulatory states ( Lehman et al . , 2000 ; Pirani et al . , 2005 ; Leh - man , 2016 ) . Energy landscape determinations predict that the ACTC1 A295S HCM mutation induces numerous minor changes in the side - chain orientations of neighboring A - triad residues , which perturb its interaction with Tm and the aggre - gate F - actin - Tm energetic topology . Relative to the broad and ﬂat energy basin found with wild - type F - actin - Tm , which helps establish the normal A / B state , the electrostatic energy land - scape of A295S F - actin - Tm has a narrow and slightly deeper basin with a discrete minimum centered away from the A / B position and closer to the C position . Consequently , this may bias Tm away from locations impeding cross - bridge - actin interactions , thus promoting C - state occupancy for ACTC1 A295S - containing thin ﬁlaments . Our data , from the molecular through the tissue level , support a single unifying mechanism that explains the most proximal effects of the ACTC1 A295S substitution and the development of HCM . In addition , they highlight a ubiquitous role for the neighboring A - triad in thin ﬁlament regulation and contractile relaxation of striated muscle . A295S - mediated pathology ap - pears to result from propagated effects that structurally rear - range the A - triad and thus deform the energy basin that helps pin Tm in an inhibitory position . In our disease model , lower B - state occupancy of mutant thin ﬁlaments resulted in addi - tional , unimpeded cross - bridge cycling , even in the absence of Ca 2 + , accounting for the restricted diastolic diameters of ﬂy hearts . Furthermore , such inordinate myosin binding enhances Tn’s afﬁnity for Ca 2 + ( Tobacman , 1996 ; Moss et al . , 2004 ; Hinken and Solaro , 2007 ) . The thin ﬁlament would accordingly be primed and require less Ca 2 + - dependent movement of Tm and TnC - Ca 2 + binding for activation . This is consistent with our ﬁndings of increased A295S thin ﬁlament Ca 2 + sensitivity , which even in the absence of changes in Ca 2 + handling , could prompt early onset and delay the completion of systole . In accordance with our results , these changes in vivo would man - ifest as prolonged SIs . Finally , altering intermolecular electro - static A - triad - Tm interactions may inﬂuence deactivation . The A - triad likely facilitates the return of Tm to the energy basin that helps constrain it to an inhibitory position ( Orzechowski et al . , 2014 ) , which may also assist with TnI - actin docking and thus expedite the termination of force production . Disrupted A - triad - Tm interactions could thereby account for the inability of IFM thin ﬁlaments , in our mutant model , to properly turn off and inhibit tension , leading to destructive myosin - based force generation ( Beall and Fyrberg , 1991 ) . Therefore , our ﬁndings in - crease comprehension of basic thin ﬁlament biology , demon - strate how the ACTC1 A295S mutation triggers the early signs of HCM , and support the mechanistic model in which mutations that initiate hyperdynamic contraction and impaired relaxation result in pathological remodeling of the human heart ( Green et al . , 2016 ; Davis et al . , 2016 ) . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Multiple Sequence Alignment of Actins Amino acid sequence comparison of human and Drosophila cardiac and skel - etal actins was performed using the Clustal Omega multiple sequence align - ment program .

Cell Reports 20 , 2612 – 2625 , September 12 , 2017 2621 Construction of UAS - Act57B and Act88F Transgenes and Transgenic Drosophila The pUASp . Act57B GFP . WT actin construct was provided by Dr . Katja Ro¨per ( Medical Research Council , Cambridge , UK ) . From this , the Act57B GFP . WT and Act57B WT cDNA sequences were spliced into the pUASTattB vector , behind 5 tandem UAS repeats ( 5 3 UAS ) , using the KpnI and XbaI and the NotI and XbaI restriction sites , respectively .

Jo´zsef Miha´ly ( HungarianAcademyofSciences , Budapest , Hungary ) . ThepattB Act88F A295S mutant construct was created by Genetic Services ( Sudbury , MA ) . Transgenic Drosophila were generated using the PhiC31 integrase system as previously delineated ( Viswanathan et al . , 2015 ) . Drosophila Stocks and Husbandry Flies were raised at 25 (cid:3) C on a standard cornmeal - yeast - sucrose - agar medium . The Hand 4 . 2 - Gal4 and the Act88F null ( ry 506 KM88 e s ) lines were obtained from Drs . Rolf Bodmer ( Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute , La Jolla , CA ) and John Sparrow ( University of York , York , UK ) , respectively . For all Gal4 - UAS crosses , Hand 4 . 2 - Gal4 virgin females were mated with UAS - Actin males . Act88F transgenic Drosophila had an endogenous actin gene ( + ) on each third chromosome , plus a transgene ( Act88F WT or Act88F A295S ) inserted into each second chromosome ( i . e . , Act88F WT / Act88F WT ; + / + or Act88F A295S / Act88F A295S ; + / + ) . The transgenes were crossed into the KM88 background by standard mating schemes using balancer chromosomes to generate Act88F WT / Act88F WT ; KM88 / KM88 and Act88F A295S / Act88F A295S ; KM88 / KM88 homozygous ﬂies ( designated as Act88F WT / Act88F WT and Act88F A295S / Act88F A295S , respectively ) . To generate heterozygotes , with one transgenic and one endogenous Act88F gene , homozygotes were crossed with w 1118 to create Act88F WT ; KM88 / + and Act88F A295S ; KM88 / + ( designated as Act88F WT / + and Act88F A295S / + ) . Confocal Microscopy of the Fly Heart Hand > Act57B GFP . WT and Hand > Act57B GFP . A295S cardiac tubes were prepared as detailed by Alayari et al . ( 2009 ) and imaged with a Leica TCS SPE RGBV confocal microscope . Tocharacterizethedegree ofoverlap ofGFP - labeledand TRITC - phalloidin - stained actin , images were analyzed using the ImageJ co - localization plugin . The average index of correlation ( Jaskolski et al . , 2005 ) was calculated for cardiac sarcomeres of each genotype . Cardiac Physiological Analysis One - , three - , ﬁve - , andseven - week - old , female Hand 3 yw , Hand > Act57B WT , and Hand > Act57B A295S semi - intact Drosophila hearts were prepared under artiﬁcial hemolymph ( AH ) as described by Vogler and Ocorr ( 2009 ) . Physiolog - ical parameters were assessed as formerly outlined ( Cammarato et al . , 2015 ; Blice - Baum et al . , 2017 ) , and signiﬁcant differences between genotype and age , and interaction effects , were determined using two - way ANOVAs with Bonferroni post hoc tests . Measurement of EGTA / EGTA , AM - and Blebbistatin - Induced Changes in Cardiac Dimensions Semi - intact hearts of three - week - old Hand 3 yw , Hand > Act57B WT , and Hand > Act57B A295S females were imaged and ﬁlmed as described by Viswa - nathan et al . ( 2014 ) . Beating hearts were recorded for 10 s in AH at various focal depths to resolve clear edges along the length of each tube . After initial ﬁlming , the AH was replaced with AH containing 10 mM EGTA and 100 m M EGTA , AM ( AAT Bioquest ) . Following 30 min ( 25 (cid:3) C ) to chelate extra - and intra - cellular Ca 2 + , the quiescent hearts were ﬁlmed as before and then incubated for 30 min in the same EGTA / EGTA , AM solution supplemented with 100 m M blebbistatin ( Cayman Chemical ) . The hearts were re - imaged and ﬁlmed for a ﬁnal time . Individual frames that clearly resolved the same region of both heart wall edges from videos taken under each condition were analyzed using HCImage Live software . Three distinct diameter measurements were made at identical locations along each tube from images obtained during diastole and under each treatment condition . Thesevalueswere averagedfor each an - imal and then for each genotype . The stepwise effects of EGTA / EGTA , AM and blebbistatin treatment on cardiac dimensions were evaluated using repeated - measures ANOVAs with Bonferroni multiple comparison tests of the matched groups . One - way ANOVAs followed by Bonferroni multiple comparison tests were used to distinguish signiﬁcant differences in the cardiac responses ( i . e . , diameter changes ) to EGTA / EGTA , AM and then to blebbistatin among genotypes . Holography Cinematic digital inline holography ( Katz and Sheng , 2010 ) was implemented to track ﬂight trajectories of two - day - old w 1118 non - transgenic actin control , Act88F WT / + , and Act88F A295S / + maleandfemale Drosophila . 30ﬂiesofagiven genotype were released from the bottom of a 44 . 5 3 44 . 5 3 44 . 5 cm 3 trans - parent acrylic enclosure maintained at 24 (cid:3) C . A halogen lamp was anchored above the chamber to entice upward ﬂight . Data acquisition and analysis methods are described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures , including sketches of the optical setup in Figure S5A and of the analysis in Figure S5B . Brieﬂy , a sample volume of 11 . 6 3 11 . 6 3 44 . 5 cm 3 was illuminated by a collimated pulsed neodymium - doped yttrium aluminum garnet ( Nd : YAG ) laser beam . The interference of light scattered from the ﬂies with the undis - turbed portions of the beam , the hologram , was recorded by a 2 , 016 3 2 , 016 pixels complementary metal - oxide semiconductor ( CMOS ) camera operating at 400 frames / s . Each run lasted 7 . 82 s , providing 3 , 128 holograms . The holograms were reconstructed numerically to obtain the intensity ﬁelds in a series of parallel planes . Multi - step detection procedures sub - sequently identiﬁed the in - focus location of each ﬂy and tracked its displace - ment in time . The trajectories were used to calculate the kinematic properties of ﬂight , including the velocity and acceleration vectors , as well as the angular velocity and the centripetal acceleration component , the latter signifying the ﬂy’s maneuverability . Signiﬁcance was assessed by non - parametric Kruskal - Wallis one - way ANOVAs followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison tests . Indirect Flight Muscle and Sarcomere Imaging Fluorescent microscopy was performed as in Viswanathan et al . ( 2015 ) to examine gross IFM morphology . Myoﬁbril imaging was carried out as previously described ( Haigh et al . , 2010 ; Cammarato et al . , 2011b ) . Thin ﬁlament lengths were measured using ImageJ . Signiﬁcance was assessed via the Kruskal - Wallis one - way ANOVA with Dunn’s post hoc test . Forimage averaging ofsarcomeres , confocal micrographs ofIFM myoﬁbrils were imported into ImageJ . Individual myoﬁbrils were straightened to ﬁll a rectangular box by drawing a segmented line , of a width equal to the myoﬁbril width , through its center and executing the Straighten command . Single sar - comeres were cropped and combined into an image stack . Images were aligned in x and y coordinate space using the plugin Template Matching / Align Slices in Stack ( https : / / sites . google . com / site / qingzongtseng / template - matching - ij - plugin ) . A reference image was selected , and all images in the stack were translated to align in approximately the same position as the refer - ence . Following automated image alignment , average sarcomere structures were generated by executing the Z Project command with the average inten - sity projection type . Actin Puriﬁcation from Drosophila Indirect Flight Muscle Act88F WT and Act88F A295S transgenic actin from (cid:1) 40 IFMs was puriﬁed according to Razzaq et al . ( 1999 ) . In Vitro Motility Sliding of Act88F WT and Act88F A295S F - actin ( Kron and Spudich , 1986 ) and ofAct88F WT and Act88F A295S thin ﬁlaments ( Liang etal . , 2003 ) , over full - length rabbit skeletal myosin , was measured via standard modiﬁcation of the in vitro motility assay . Thin ﬁlaments were reconstituted using bovine cardiac Tm and Tn . F - actin velocities measured in each of three replicate experiments were 2622 Cell Reports 20 , 2612 – 2625 , September 12 , 2017 averaged , and the average velocities were pooled and weighted based on the number of ﬁlaments analyzed in each experiment . Signiﬁcance was assessed by an unpaired t test . For Ca 2 + - regulated motility experiments , average ﬁla - ment velocities at each distinct [ Ca 2 + ] were pooled and weighted based on thenumberofﬁlamentsanalyzedforeach ofsixreplicate experiments . Pooled velocity : Ca 2 + data were re - plotted and ﬁt to the Hill equation , and signiﬁcant differences in ﬁt parameters ( V max , pCa 50 , and cooperativity ) were determined via extra sum of squares F tests . See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for further details . Determination of F - Actin - Tropomyosin Energy Landscapes Energy landscapes for Tm and wild - type or A295S mutant F - actin were calculated as previously published ( Rynkiewicz et al . , 2015 ) with minor mod - iﬁcations . Brieﬂy , a model of Tm and F - actin was constructed . Tm was then azimuthally rotated and longitudinally translated to the grid points to be tested . This step can result in poor contacts that are unresolvable through minimization . Therefore , before minimization , Tm and actin side chains in proximity in the model were shrunk , and they were allowed to relax back during minimization . Constraints were applied in the minimization to keep the distance to actin and the overall shape of Tm consistent with known values for a Tm cable . All calculations were performed with CHARMM v . 35b ( Brooks et al . , 2009 ) . Statistical Methods Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7 .
