Here we report a detailed investigation of its mechanism of inhibition . Blebbistatin does not compete with nucleotide binding to the skeletal muscle myosin subfragment - 1 . The inhibitor preferentially binds to the ATPase intermediate with ADP and phosphate bound at the active site , and it slows down phosphate release . Blebbistatin interferes neither with binding of myosin to actin nor with ATP - induced actomyosin dissociation . Instead , it blocks the myosin heads in a products com - plex with low actin affinity . Blind docking molecular simulations indicate that the productive blebbistatin - binding site of the myosin head is within the aqueous cavity between the nucleotide pocket and the cleft of the actin - binding interface . The property that blebbistatin blocks myosin II in an actin - detached state makes the compound useful both in muscle physiology and in ex - ploring the cellular function of cytoplasmic myosin II isoforms , whereas the stabilization of a specific myosin intermediate confers a great potential in structural studies . Myosin IIs are ATP - driven molecular motors forming an essential part of the motile machinery of most eukaryotic cell types examined . Among other functions , they serve such di - verse and vital functions as muscle contraction , cytokinesis , cortical tension maintenance , and neurite outgrowth and re - traction ( 1 – 6 ) . In studies of myosin II , the use of enzyme inhibitors can be a powerful approach , provided that selective and high affinity compounds are available that do not interfere with other cellular processes . The importance of the latter aspect is emphasized by a recent study ( 7 ) that showed that 2 , 3 - butanedione - monoxime , a compound widely used to inhibit myosin II , is not specific and probably affects the function of a wide range of proteins . Blebbistatin was recently discovered as a small molecule inhibitor of muscle and non - muscle myosin II ( 8 ) . The com - pound is permeable to cell membranes . It is a potent inhibitor of skeletal muscle and non - muscle myosin II isoforms , although it has little or no effect on smooth muscle myosin II and myo - sins from classes I , V , and X ( 9 ) . Because of its selectivity and high affinity for several class II myosins , blebbistatin has the potential to become a popular tool in the fields of cell motility and muscle physiology . For the interpretation of the cellular effects caused by blebbistatin , a detailed understanding is es - sential of its effects on the myosin II ATPase and on the interaction of the myosin head with actin and substrate . We undertook an in - depth characterization of the effect of bleb - bistatin on the functional properties of rabbit skeletal muscle myosin II , and we performed blind docking simulations on various atomic structures of the myosin head to determine the binding site and the structural basis of isoform specificity of the inhibitor . We find that blebbistatin exerts its inhibitory effect by bind - ing to the myosin - ADP - P i complex with high affinity and inter - fering with the phosphate release process . Thus , the inhibitor blocks myosin in an actin - detached state , and therefore it pre - vents rigid actomyosin cross - linking , which is a great advan - tage in in vivo applications . By using molecular simulations , we identify the aqueous cavity between the nucleotide - and actin - binding sites of the myosin head as the productive binding site for blebbistatin . All myosin IIs characterized to date follow a common basic enzymatic mechanism ( 10 ) . Therefore , the mode of inhibition of other muscle and non - muscle myosin II isoforms is expected to be similar to those described herein . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials— Rabbit fast skeletal muscle myosin and subfragment - 1 ( S1 ) 1 were prepared as described in Refs . 11 and 12 , respectively . Actin was prepared as in Ref . 13 and pyrene - labeled as in Ref 14 . Blebbistatin was either generously provided by Drs . Aaron F . Straight and Timothy J . Mitchison ( Harvard Medical School ) or purchased from Toronto Re - search Chemicals . Contrasting with previous observations ( 8 ) , we found that the K 1 ⁄ 2 values and maximal extents of inhibition by the two stereoisomers of blebbistatin are very similar ( data not shown ) . There - fore , we used an unresolved blebbistatin mixture in all experiments . Conditions— If not stated otherwise , experiments were carried out at 25 °C . For experiments not involving actin plus those in Fig . 5 , the following assay buffer was used : 20 m M MOPS ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 5 m M MgCl 2 , 100 m M KCl , 0 . 1 m M EGTA . For experiments involving actin except those in Fig . 5 , the following assay buffer was used : 4 m M MOPS ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 2 m M MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 m M EGTA . Mg 2 (cid:1) concentration was always kept higher than total nucleotide concentration . Steady - state ATPase Assay— MgATPase activities were measured by an NADH - linked assay as described previously ( 15 ) in 1 m M ATP . Data were corrected for background ATPase activity of actin . Stopped - flow Experiments— These experiments were carried out in a KinTek SF - 2001 instrument . Fluorescence excitation / emission setups were the following : tryptophan , 295 / 347 - nm bandpass ( 50 nm band - width ) ; mant and pyrene , 365 nm / 400 nm long pass . Light scattering was measured at 340 nm . Actin filaments were stabilized by addition of a 1 . 5 - fold molar excess of phalloidin . If not stated otherwise , post - mixing concentrations are as indicated throughout the text . Exceptions are the stopped - flow - based equilibrium titrations , where preincubation concentrations are relevant in the analysis of signal change amplitudes , * This work was funded by the EMBO / HHMI Young Investigator Programme and the Wellcome Trust ( to A .

Volume ratios in stopped - flow mixtures were 1 : 1 in all experiments . Quenched - flow Experiments— These experiments were performed in a KinTek RQF - 3 apparatus by using [ (cid:1) - 32 P ] ATP as described earlier ( 15 ) . Reagent concentrations after mixing are indicated . Acto - S1 Cosedimentation— 50 – 100 - (cid:2) l samples were ultracentrifuged at 100 , 000 rpm in a Beckman TLA - 100 rotor for 15 min at 4 °C , and the supernatants and pellets were analyzed by 4 – 20 % SDS - PAGE . Relative amounts of proteins in electrophoretic bands were determined by den - sitometry using the Kodak ID 3 . 5 software . Data Analysis— Reported means and standard errors are those of two to six rounds of experiment . Fitting of the data sets was done using the KinTek software and OriginLab 7 . 0 ( Microcal Corp . ) . Computational Docking— Throughout the search for putative bind - ing sites of ( R ) - ( (cid:1) ) - and ( S ) - ( (cid:3) ) - blebbistatin on the myosin head was performed by using our previously published blind docking approach ( 16 ) with the AutoDock 3 . 0 program package ( 17 ) . Atomic structures for head domains of nucleotide - free skeletal muscle myosin ( 2MYS ) , ADP (cid:1) BeF x - bound smooth muscle myosin ( 1BR4 ) , Dictyostelium myosin II with ATP ( 1FMW ) or ADP (cid:1) AlF 4 ( 1MND ) bound , and nucleotide - free myosin V ( 1OE9 ) of the Protein Data Bank were applied as target molecules during the calculations . For each protein and enantiomer of blebbistatin , 100 docking runs were evaluated . Representative groups ( i . e . the binding patterns ) were collected and ordered based on the calculated binding free energy of the complexes ( 16 ) . RESULTS Steady - state Inhibition— In the experiments described , we used a soluble head fragment of skeletal myosin ( S1 ) that contains the actin - and nucleotide - binding sites and retains the enzymatic properties of the full - length molecule ( 10 ) . “S1” re - fers to rabbit skeletal muscle S1 throughout this article . The basal MgATPase activity of S1 measured in the absence of actin ( 0 . 08 (cid:4) 0 . 01 s (cid:3) 1 in the absence of blebbistatin ) was inhibited by blebbistatin to a large extent ( 92 (cid:4) 4 % maximal inhibition ) with half - maximal inhibition at 1 . 6 (cid:4) 0 . 6 (cid:2) M blebbistatin ( Fig . 1 A , see also Table I for a summary of parameters determined in this study ) . The acto - S1 ATPase activity ( uninhibited V max (cid:5) 24 . 0 (cid:4) 1 . 5 s (cid:3) 1 ) was almost totally inhibited with half - maximal inhibition at 0 . 4 (cid:4) 0 . 1 (cid:2) M blebbistatin ( Fig . 1 A ) . Nevertheless , actin activated the low inhibited basal S1 ATPase ( 0 . 005 (cid:4) 0 . 001 s (cid:3) 1 ) even in 50 (cid:2) M blebbistatin to a maximum of 0 . 45 (cid:4) 0 . 02 s (cid:3) 1 ( about 2 % of the uninhibited activity ) ( Fig . 1 B ) . The inhibitor did not have a systematic effect on the K ATPase value ( i . e . the actin concentration at half - maximal activation , Fig . 1 B and Table I ) . At low blebbistatin concentrations where the binding equi - librium between enzyme and inhibitor is slow compared with enzymatic turnover , an initial nonlinear phase in activity could be observed whereby the system was reaching steady - state inhibition . Fig . 1 C shows that at low blebbistatin concentra - tions , the onset of the blebbistatin - inhibited steady - state of the acto - S1 ATPase was preceded by a slow exponential phase whose observed rate constant ( k obs ) fell between 0 . 02 and 0 . 07 s (cid:3) 1 in the blebbistatin concentration range of 0 . 5 – 4 (cid:2) M , and indicated that the blebbistatin off - rate constant from S1 during ATP turnover is below 0 . 02 s (cid:3) 1 and the on - rate constant is in the order of 0 . 01 (cid:2) M (cid:3) 1 s (cid:3) 1 ( data not shown ) . These values define a K d value of blebbistatin binding to S1 around 1 (cid:2) M , close to the above half - maximal inhibition value . The precise dependence of k obs on blebbistatin concentration could not be reliably determined because the rate constants of the exponen - tial and linear phases were highly covariant . It is noteworthy that in these experiments several hundred ATP turnovers had occurred before the system reached steady - state inhibition ( the uninhibited acto - S1 ATPase activity was 20 s (cid:3) 1 under the conditions used ) . Blebbistatin Binding to S1 ATPase Intermediates— The con - formational changes of the myosin head occurring during ATP binding , hydrolysis , and product release cause changes in its tryptophan fluorescence that have been extensively utilized to monitor the ATPase cycle ( 18 – 26 ) . When S1 was mixed with excess ATP in the absence of blebbistatin , an initial rapid increase in S1 tryptophan fluorescence that reflects the binding of ATP was followed by a steady state with a constantly ele - vated fluorescence level ( Fig . 2 A ) . When the ATP solution also contained blebbistatin , the initial fluorescence increase was followed by a quench phase leading to a steady - state fluores - cence level that is 5 – 10 % lower than that of apoS1 ( Fig . 2 A ) . The quench phase was a single exponential , and its k obs was linearly dependent on blebbistatin concentration with a slope of 0 . 0034 (cid:4) 0 . 0002 (cid:2) M (cid:3) 1 s (cid:3) 1 ( reflecting the on - rate constant of blebbistatin binding to S1 during steady - state ATP hydrolysis , Table I ) and an intercept of 0 . 011 (cid:4) 0 . 003 s (cid:3) 1 ( off - rate , Fig . 2 B ) . A fluorescent S1 substrate , mant - ATP , shows a fluorescence increase on binding to S1 . When S1 was mixed with excess mant - ATP in the stopped flow , an initial fluorescence increase was followed by a period with high mant fluorescence ( Fig . 2 C ) . When 50 (cid:2) M blebbistatin was included in both syringes , the initial increase was followed by a quench phase whose k obs F IG . 1 . Inhibition of the steady - state ATPase activity of S1 by blebbistatin . A , relative basal ( solid circles ) and actin - activated ( open circles ) steady - state ATPase activities of S1 at different blebbistatin concentrations . The basal ATPase activity ( 0 . 08 s (cid:3) 1 ) was inhibited to a maximal extent of 91 % ( K 1 ⁄ 2 (cid:5) 1 . 4 (cid:2) M ) , whereas the actin - activated ATPase activity ( 18 s (cid:3) 1 at 43 (cid:2) M actin ) was almost totally inhibited ( by 99 % ) with a K 1 ⁄ 2 of 0 . 4 (cid:2) M in the experiments shown . B , actin activation of S1 ATPase at the indicated blebbistatin concentrations . V max and K ATPase values were 26 s (cid:3) 1 and 24 (cid:2) M ( 0 (cid:2) M blebbistatin ) , 12 s (cid:3) 1 and 43 (cid:2) M ( 1 (cid:2) M blebbistatin ) , and 0 . 45 s (cid:3) 1 and 11 (cid:2) M ( 50 (cid:2) M blebbistatin ) , respectively . C , onset of the inhibition of S1 ATPase activity on mixing 30 n M S1 , 50 (cid:2) M actin , and blebbistatin at the indicated concentrations with 1 m M ATP . Measured absorbance values were corrected to the start point of the reaction . Measurements were performed by using an NADH - linked enzyme assay as described ( 15 ) . The conditions were as follows : 25 °C , 4 m M MOPS ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 2 m M MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 m M EGTA .

Fig . 2 , A and C , note the different time scales of the two panels ) . The results in Fig . 2 suggest that blebbistatin will bind to a nucleotide - bound S1 ATPase intermediate slowly but with high affinity ( K d (cid:5) 3 . 1 (cid:4) 0 . 8 (cid:2) M , close to the concentration needed for half - maximal steady - state inhibition , cf . Table I ) , and its bind - ing is accompanied by a quench in both tryptophan and mant fluorescence . The affinity of blebbistatin to apoS1 is also of interest . Bleb - bistatin itself is luminescent , but neither the inhibitor nor S1 showed an analyzable signal change on mixing the two compo - nents . When preincubated with S1 , however , blebbistatin caused a detectable decrease in the apparent ATP binding rate constant of S1 ( Table I ) . Considering that ATP binding is a fast process , this effect is likely caused by a pre - existing interaction between S1 and the inhibitor . We determined the affinity of blebbistatin for apoS1 by an indirect experiment analyzing the tryptophan fluorescence transients on rapidly mixing ATP with S1 preincubated with different concentrations of blebbistatin . In the absence of blebbistatin , a single exponential increase with a k obs of 85 s (cid:3) 1 was observed at 100 (cid:2) M ( pre - mix ) ATP concentration ( Fig . 3 A ) . When S1 was preincubated with bleb - bistatin , double exponential traces were obtained with phases around 85 and 30 s (cid:3) 1 . The fractional amplitude of the slow phase ( A slow / ( A fast (cid:1) A slow ) ) increased with increasing bleb - bistatin concentration , and the obtained trace was essentially a single exponential with a k obs around 30 s (cid:3) 1 above 100 (cid:2) M ( pre - mix ) blebbistatin ( Fig . 3 B ) . Even though the two k obs val - ues of the biphasic traces were separated only by about a factor of 3 , the fractional amplitude of the slow phase plotted against blebbistatin concentration fitted well to a hyperbola and showed a K d of 25 (cid:4) 2 (cid:2) M for blebbistatin binding to apoS1 ( Fig . 3 B ) . The ADP affinity of S1 was measured by preincubating 0 . 2 (cid:2) M S1 with various amounts of ADP in the absence and pres - ence of 100 (cid:2) M blebbistatin and then rapidly mixing with 100 (cid:2) M ATP ( pre - mix concentrations stated , traces not shown ) . The slow phase ( k obs (cid:5) 1 . 7 (cid:4) 0 . 2 s (cid:3) 1 in the absence and 1 . 1 (cid:4) 0 . 2 s (cid:3) 1 in the presence of blebbistatin ) of the obtained biphasic tryptophan fluorescence increase transients represents the fraction of S1 that was ADP - bound before the rapid mix . Here ADP dissociation limits the rate of ATP binding and therefore that of the fluorescence change . The fast phase ( k obs (cid:5) 70 s (cid:3) 1 in the absence and 30 s (cid:3) 1 in the presence of 100 (cid:2) M ( pre - mix ) blebbistatin ) represents the S1 fraction that did not contain bound nucleotide and thus could directly bind ATP . The frac - tional amplitude of the slow phase showed a hyperbolic depend - ence on ADP concentration , and very similar K d values were determined in the absence and presence of blebbistatin ( 1 . 41 (cid:4) 0 . 06 and 1 . 36 (cid:4) 0 . 11 (cid:2) M , respectively , Fig . 3 C ) .

A , tryptophan fluorescence transients recorded on mixing 0 . 5 (cid:2) M S1 with 50 (cid:2) M ATP plus blebbistatin at the indicated concentrations . In the presence of blebbistatin , the initial rapid fluorescence increase was followed by a quench phase ( k obs (cid:5) 0 . 03 s (cid:3) 1 at 7 . 5 (cid:2) M blebbistatin and 0 . 18 s (cid:3) 1 at 50 (cid:2) M blebbistatin ) leading to a fluorescence level that is 5 – 10 % lower than that of apoS1 . Traces were normalized to their starting values . B , dependence of k obs of the quench phase on blebbistatin concentration . Linear fit to the data yielded a slope of 0 . 0033 (cid:2) M (cid:3) 1 s (cid:3) 1 and an intercept of 0 . 0076 s (cid:3) 1 in the experiment shown . C , mant - ATP fluorescence transients on mixing 0 . 1 (cid:2) M S1 with 0 . 5 (cid:2) M mant - ATP in the absence and presence of 50 (cid:2) M blebbistatin ( in all syringes ) . Without blebbistatin , an initial fluorescence increase ( k obs (cid:5) 2 . 1 s (cid:3) 1 ) was followed by a period with elevated mant fluorescence . In blebbistatin , the initial increase ( k obs (cid:5) 2 . 1 s (cid:3) 1 ) was followed by a quench with a k obs of 0 . 21 s (cid:3) 1 . Traces were normalized to their starting values .

Similarly to the tryptophan experiments , biphasic fluorescence traces were ob - tained yielding a K d of S1 for ADP of 1 . 04 (cid:4) 0 . 03 (cid:2) M in the absence and 0 . 77 (cid:4) 0 . 03 (cid:2) M in the presence of 50 (cid:2) M blebbista - tin ( plot not shown ) . Effect of Blebbistatin on ATP Hydrolysis— To observe di - rectly the effect of blebbistatin on the ATP hydrolysis step , we performed quenched - flow experiments using ATP radioactively labeled on its (cid:1) - phosphate . When 5 (cid:2) M S1 was mixed with a 10 - fold excess of ATP , an initial rapid exponential burst ( k obs (cid:5) 40 s (cid:3) 1 ) in P i production was observed that was followed by a linear steady - state phase ( Fig . 4 A ) . The slope of the steady - state phase ( 0 . 06 (cid:4) 0 . 01 s (cid:3) 1 ) was consistent with the basal ATPase activity of S1 measured by the steady - state assay ( Table I ) . The amplitude of the burst was 0 . 26 (cid:4) 0 . 04 mol of P i / mol of S1 . In the presence of 50 (cid:2) M blebbistatin ( in all syringes ) , the burst phase ( k obs (cid:5) 20 s (cid:3) 1 ) amplitude was ele - vated to 0 . 80 (cid:4) 0 . 13 mol of P i / mol of S1 , whereas the linear steady - state phase was inhibited by (cid:8) 80 % ( Fig . 4 A ) . In single turnover quenched - flow experiments , 2 . 5 (cid:2) M S1 was mixed with 1 (cid:2) M ATP in the absence and presence of 50 (cid:2) M blebbista - tin ( in all syringes ) ( Fig . 4 B ) . Here the kinetics of the fast phase of ATP hydrolysis is limited by nucleotide binding , whereas the slow phase reflects P i release . Double exponential approxima - tions to the time courses showed similar burst values to the multiple turnover experiments . Because the ATP hydrolysis step is followed by the rate - limiting release of phosphate , the amplitude of the initial burst ( expressed as n P i / n S1 in multiple turnover , and the fractional amplitude of the fast phase in the single turnover experimental setup ) will define the equilibrium constant of the ATP hydrol - ysis step on the enzyme as K (cid:5) A / ( 1 (cid:3) A ) , where A is the P i burst amplitude . The obtained burst amplitude and hydrolysis equilibrium constant in the absence of blebbistatin was consid - erably lower than the literature values available ( 27 ) , which likely reflects the pH dependence of this reaction step ( our measurements were performed at pH 7 , whereas earlier exper - iments were done at pH 8 ) . The amplitude was well reproduc - ible in our experiments . The reported data are from six inde - pendent experiments performed on three different S1 preparations . Data obtained with freshly prepared and previ - ously fast - frozen material were identical . All other kinetic pa - rameters determined with our S1 preparations were in line with literature values . Effect of Blebbistatin on the Actin Interaction of S1— The quench in pyrene fluorescence that occurs on pyrene - actin binding to S1 was used to follow the actin binding kinetics of S1 . As shown in Fig . 5 A , the presence of 50 (cid:2) M blebbistatin does not cause a profound change in the acto - S1 binding rate con - stant ( k on (cid:5) 4 . 7 (cid:4) 0 . 8 (cid:2) M (cid:3) 1 s (cid:3) 1 in the absence and 3 . 0 (cid:4) 0 . 5 (cid:2) M (cid:3) 1 s (cid:3) 1 in the presence of 50 (cid:2) M blebbistatin in all syringes ) . The rigor actin binding affinity ( i . e . that in the absence of nucleotides ) of S1 was investigated by a stopped - flow - based titration where 0 . 1 (cid:2) M pyrene - actin was preincubated with various amounts of S1 and then rapidly mixed with excess ATP to fully dissociate acto - S1 . Thus , the total amplitudes of the recorded pyrene fluorescence transients reflect the concentra - tion of the strongly actin - bound fraction of S1 before mixing with ATP . Quadratic fits of the dependence of the observed amplitudes on S1 concentration ( 28 ) showed that the presence of 50 (cid:2) M blebbistatin ( in all syringes ) had no detectable effect on the observed actin affinity of S1 ( K d (cid:6) 50 n M , Fig . 5 B ) . The kinetics of ATP - induced acto - S1 dissociation was meas - ured by monitoring the pyrene fluorescence increase on mixing pyrene - acto - S1 with increasing concentrations of ATP . Fig . 5 C shows that the presence of 50 (cid:2) M blebbistatin ( in all syringes ) did not significantly change the apparent second order binding constant of ATP to acto - S1 ( 5 . 4 (cid:4) 0 . 1 (cid:2) M (cid:3) 1 s (cid:3) 1 in the absence and 4 . 8 (cid:4) 0 . 3 (cid:2) M (cid:3) 1 s (cid:3) 1 in the presence of 50 (cid:2) M blebbistatin in all syringes ; Table I ) . The lack of effect of the presence of blebbistatin in the ex - periments of Fig . 5 , B and C , indicates that either the actin - related properties of blebbistatin - bound S1 are unchanged compared with blebbistatin - free S1 or , more probably , that acto - S1 has a very low blebbistatin affinity , and little of the acto - S1 complexes has bound blebbistatin ( see below ) .

A , tryptophan fluorescence transients on mixing 0 . 5 (cid:2) M S1 plus blebbistatin at the indicated concentrations with 100 (cid:2) M ATP ( pre - mixing concentrations stated ) . The k obs values were 85 s (cid:3) 1 ( 0 (cid:2) M blebbistatin ) and 30 s (cid:3) 1 ( 180 (cid:2) M blebbistatin ) . At 30 (cid:2) M blebbistatin , the trace was a double exponential with phases around 85 and 30 s (cid:3) 1 . Traces were normalized to their starting values .

C , 0 . 2 (cid:2) M S1 plus ADP at different concentrations was preincubated in the absence ( solid circles ) and presence ( open circles ) of 100 (cid:2) M blebbistatin and then rapidly mixed with 100 (cid:2) M ATP ( pre - mix concentrations stated ) . Fractional amplitude of the slow phase ( A slow / ( A fast (cid:1) A slow ) ) of the obtained biphasic tryptophan fluorescence transients is plotted against ADP concentration . From hyperbolic fits to the data , K d values for ADP binding to S1 were 1 . 41 (cid:4) 0 . 06 (cid:2) M in the absence and 1 . 36 (cid:4) 0 . 11 (cid:2) M in the presence of 100 (cid:2) M blebbistatin . Observed rate constants of the traces were 66 (cid:4) 14 s (cid:3) 1 and 1 . 7 (cid:4) 0 . 2 s (cid:3) 1 in the absence and 28 (cid:4) 7 s (cid:3) 1 and 1 . 1 (cid:4) 0 . 2 s (cid:3) 1 in the presence of blebbistatin .

The pyrene fluorescence and light scattering changes had opposite signs , consistent with the fact that acto - S1 dissociation causes an increase in pyrene fluorescence and a decrease in light scatter - ing . In the presence of 50 (cid:2) M blebbistatin ( in all syringes ) , the dissociation kinetics was similar ( k obs (cid:5) 90 s (cid:3) 1 ) , but no resto - ration of the signal was observed in 60 s ( Fig . 6 B ) . This result implies that in blebbistatin , S1 is predominantly not strongly bound to actin during steady - state ATP hydrolysis , similarly to the case when the inhibitor is not present . Steady - state ATP hydrolysis was presumably not completed in the observed pe - riod in the presence of blebbistatin ( cf . Fig . 1 A and Table I ) . In ultracentrifugation experiments , S1 alone ( 20 (cid:2) M ) was found entirely in the supernatants of the samples , whereas it fully cosedimented with 50 (cid:2) M actin in the absence of nucleo - tide ( Fig . 6 C ) . Addition of 50 (cid:2) M blebbistatin did not have an effect on these properties . After addition of 10 m M ATP to acto - S1 , most of the S1 was found in the supernatants both in the absence and presence of blebbistatin , showing that the inhibitor does not dramatically alter the distribution of actin - bound and detached S1 states during steady - state ATP hydrol - ysis . Notably , in the presence of blebbistatin , a slightly smaller fraction of S1 was pelleted ( Fig . 6 C and Table I ) . As measured spectrophotometrically ( blebbistatin has an absorbance peak at 422 nm ) ( 8 ) , practically all the blebbistatin was in the super - natants of all samples , indicating that actin - bound S1 did not detectably bind blebbistatin ( data not shown ) . Blind Docking of Blebbistatin on the Myosin Head— We per - formed blind docking simulations of blebbistatin enantiomers on various myosin atomic structures ( skeletal muscle myosin , smooth muscle myosin , Dictyostelium myosin II in the open and closed conformations , and myosin V ) to elucidate the structural basis of the interaction of S1 with blebbistatin . Computational mapping of the binding sites yielded interaction patterns for each blebbistatin - myosin complex . Binding patterns were com - pared based on experimentally determined K 1 ⁄ 2 values ( 9 ) . Skel - etal muscle myosin and Dictyostelium myosin II are strongly inhibited ( half - maximal inhibition at 0 . 5 and 4 . 9 (cid:2) M blebbista - tin , respectively ) , whereas myosin V ( K 1 ⁄ 2 (cid:7) 150 (cid:2) M ) and smooth muscle myosin ( K 1 ⁄ 2 (cid:5) 80 (cid:2) M ) are not or very poorly inhibited by F IG . 4 .

The single exponential P i burst ( k obs (cid:5) 40 s (cid:3) 1 in the absence and 20 s (cid:3) 1 in the presence of blebbistatin ) was followed by a linear steady - state phase .

The initial P i burst of the reaction as determined from the amplitudes of the two phases as A fast / ( A fast (cid:1) A slow ) was 0 . 26 in the absence and 0 . 76 in the presence of blebbistatin in the experiments shown .

Amplitudes of the resulting pyrene fluorescence increase are shown normalized to their fitted maximal values . Quadratic fits yielded a K d of 0 . 055 (cid:4) 0 . 017 (cid:2) M in the absence and 0 . 040 (cid:4) 0 . 020 (cid:2) M in the presence of blebbistatin .

The apparent ATP binding rate constant of acto - S1 was 5 . 4 (cid:2) M (cid:3) 1 s (cid:3) 1 in the absence and 4 . 8 (cid:2) M (cid:3) 1 s (cid:3) 1 in the presence of blebbistatin in the data set shown .

On this basis , it was possible to distinguish func - tional and nonfunctional binding sites . Nonoverlapping regions of the binding patterns of skeletal muscle myosin and Dictyo - stelium myosin II were excluded . Consecutively , the overlap - ping parts of the binding patterns of Dictyostelium myosin II and those of noninhibited myosins were excluded as possible inhibitory binding sites . The remaining conformers of the bind - ing pattern were located within the aqueous cavity between the actin binding cleft and the nucleotide - binding pocket ( Fig . 7 ) . It was concluded that this region was a possible inhibitory bind - ing site of blebbistatin . The above binding position exists both in the so - called open ( MgATP complex ) and closed ( MgAlF 4 complex ) states of Dic - tyostelium myosin II . The binding conformer of blebbistatin in the aqueous cavity of the closed state ( Fig . 7 ) has the strongest interaction with the protein among the 100 docked ligands . Based on the calculated affinities , blebbistatin binding to this site is three times stronger to the closed state than to the open conformation . Comparison of the binding patterns of the ( R ) - ( (cid:1) ) - and ( S ) - ( (cid:3) ) - enantiomers of blebbistatin showed no signif - icant difference in the case of all studied myosins . DISCUSSION Based on the results of the kinetic analysis , we propose a mechanism for blebbistatin inhibition of basal ATPase activity of S1 as depicted in Scheme 1 . Blebbistatin binds relatively weakly to apoS1 ( K apo (cid:5) 25 (cid:2) M ) and does not interfere with the nucleotide binding process . It has been shown that upon ADP binding , S1 adopts a conformation that is called the open state based on the position of the switch II loop in the active site of S1 ( 10 ) . Because blebbistatin does not alter the ADP affinity of S1 ( K 4 (cid:5) K (cid:2) 4 (cid:5) 1 . 4 (cid:2) M , Fig . 3 C ) , it follows that the open state M (cid:1) ADP complex has practically the same affinity for blebbista - tin as apoS1 ( K MD (cid:5) 24 (cid:2) M , Scheme 1 ) . The affinity of bleb - bistatin for both apoS1 and nucleotide - bound S1 in the open conformation is much lower than the steady - state K 1 ⁄ 2 value and the apparent affinity of blebbistatin for S1 during ATP hydrol - ysis ( 1 – 3 (cid:2) M , Figs . 1 A and 2 B ; Table I ) . Thus , it can be inferred that blebbistatin binds preferentially to a different nucleotide - bound S1 conformation . It has been shown that upon ATP binding , an open state M (cid:1) ATP complex will initially be formed ( 10 ) that isomerizes into the closed state in which ATP hydrol - ysis takes place ( 10 , 22 , 29 , 30 ) . If blebbistatin binds (cid:8) 10 times stronger to the closed M (cid:1) ADP (cid:1) P i state than to the open confor - mation M (cid:1) ATP complex , then it follows from thermodynamic considerations that the apparent equilibrium constant of ATP hydrolysis will be (cid:8) 10 times elevated by the inhibitor . Indeed , this was seen in the quenched - flow experiments of Fig . 4 ( K 2 (cid:5) 0 . 35 , K (cid:2) 2 (cid:5) 4 ) . Thus , as K MDP ( Scheme 1 ) is about 3 (cid:2) M ( Fig . 2 B ) , the open state M (cid:1) ATP will bind blebbistatin with a K MT of 35 (cid:2) M , a value similar to that in the case of the M (cid:1) ADP complex . Opening of switch II is kinetically coupled to the release of F IG . 7 . Proposed binding site of blebbistatin in myosin II . The strongest conformer of the blebbistatin docking pattern in the structure of the Dictyostelium myosin II motor domain (cid:1) ADP (cid:1) AlF 4 complex ( closed conformation ) is shown ( 30 ) . This blebbistatin conformer is positioned in the aqueous cavity located between the actin binding cleft and the switch I / switch II region . Blebbistatin binds to the open form of the myosin head at a similar location , but the binding is three times weaker . The two enantiomers of blebbistatin showed very similar bind - ing patterns and binding energies .

Effect of blebbistatin on the distribution of actin - bound and detached S1 states during ATP hydrolysis . A and B , pyrene - actin fluorescence and light scattering transients on mixing a 5 (cid:2) M pyrene - actin and 2 (cid:2) M S1 with 20 (cid:2) M ATP in the absence ( A ) and presence ( B ) of 50 (cid:2) M blebbistatin ( in all syringes ) . In the absence of blebbistatin , the rapid dissociation of acto - S1 ( k obs (cid:5) 80 s (cid:3) 1 ) was followed by an (cid:8) 10 - s period with a constant signal level before reversal of the initial signal changes . In blebbistatin , k obs of the rapid phase was similar ( 90 s (cid:3) 1 ) , but no restoration of the signal was observed . Traces were normalized to their starting values . Note the break in the x axis . C , acto - S1 cosedimentation . The following samples ( in the absence and presence of 50 (cid:2) M blebbistatin ) were analyzed by ultracentrifugation followed by SDS - PAGE : M , 20 (cid:2) M S1 ; AM , 20 (cid:2) M S1 (cid:1) 50 (cid:2) M actin ; AMT , 20 (cid:2) M S1 (cid:1) 50 (cid:2) M actin (cid:1) 10 m M ATP . S1 heavy chain band of the supernatants ( S ) and pellets ( P ) is shown . In ATP , about 10 and 4 % of S1 sedimented with actin in the absence and presence of blebbistatin , respectively . Spectrophotometric analysis showed that all blebbistatin was in the supernatant in all samples . Conditions were as in Fig . 1 . AU , arbitrary units .

Thus , the stabilization of the closed state by blebbistatin will be accompanied by an inhibition of phosphate release ( possibly through an effect on the preced - ing closed - open transition ) , the step that is rate - limiting in the ATPase cycle even in the absence of the inhibitor . In this respect , the inhibitory mechanism of blebbistatin is similar to that of N - benzyl - p - toluenesulfonamide , a specific inhibitor of fast skeletal myosin II ( 31 ) . Blebbistatin slows down the steady - state ATPase rate of S1 from 0 . 08 s (cid:3) 1 to about 0 . 005 s (cid:3) 1 . The maximally inhibited rate will thus be determined by the decomposition of the quaternary blebbistatin (cid:1) M (cid:1) ADP (cid:1) P i complex ( Scheme 1 ) either in the direction of phosphate release ( k (cid:2) 3 ) or blebbistatin dissociation from M (cid:1) ADP (cid:1) P i ( k MDP ) . Massive inhibition of the actin - activated ATPase by bleb - bistatin parallels that of the basal activity , leaving the extent of maximal actin - activation not greatly affected ( (cid:8) 300 - fold with - out blebbistatin , and (cid:8) 100 - fold in its presence ) . The K ATPase value is not greatly changed by the inhibitor , implying that weak actomyosin interaction is not influenced by blebbistatin . Acto - S1 rigor binding and ATP - induced acto - S1 dissociation are not affected by the presence of 50 (cid:2) M blebbistatin , probably because of the very low blebbistatin affinity of acto - S1 . Thus , the communication between ATP - and actin - binding sites and the coupling between the bindings of these two ligands were not abolished . Our results also bear a number of structural implications . Blebbistatin does not inhibit binding of any nucleotide ligands to apoS1 , but it has markedly differing affinities for different S1 states and seems to favor intermediates in the closed con - formation . Blebbistatin has no effect on several unconventional myosins ( 9 ) , although the sequence of the structural elements comprising the ATP - binding site is highly conserved through - out the myosin superfamily ( 2 ) . Thus , it is likely that the inhibitor does not directly bind into the nucleotide pocket of myosin II but causes specific perturbations in the structure of that region . Furthermore , blebbistatin and actin binding to S1 seem strongly antagonistic ( Fig . 6 C ) . All of these findings are in line with the computational docking results suggesting that the productive blebbistatin - binding site is within the aqueous cav - ity near the bottom of the actin binding cleft , and also close to the (cid:1) - phosphate - binding site . This binding site may be acces - sible to some extent even in the apo and open states of S1 , but adoption of the switch II closed conformation may stabilize a more open state of the actin cleft and / or provide more favorable protein - ligand interactions , resulting in an increased blebbista - tin affinity . Simulations indicate that blebbistatin binding in the cavity is three times stronger in the switch II closed state than in the open state , which is in reasonable agreement with the experimental binding data ( K d (cid:5) 3 (cid:2) M for closed state and 25 – 30 (cid:2) M for open state , see Table I ) . The binding site is inaccessible in atomic structures of myosin isoforms that are not inhibited by blebbistatin ( smooth muscle myosin and myosin V ( 9 ) ) . In conclusion , blebbistatin can mostly be classified as uncom - petitive based on the classical types of enzyme inhibitors ; be - cause it binds to a nucleotide - bound enzyme intermediate with highest affinity , it does not compete with substrate for binding sites on the enzyme , and it drastically lowers the V max value . Blebbistatin blocks myosin II in an actin - detached state . Thus , it is a “benign” inhibitor conferring the great advantage that it does not cause adverse effects arising from rigid actomyosin cross - linking in cell biological applications . These features , to - gether with its isoform specificity , make blebbistatin a useful compound in the investigation of all aspects of myosin II motor activity . Acknowledgments— We thank Drs .
