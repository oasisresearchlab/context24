Using archived YouTube live video transcripts and associated live chat messages , we find evidence for emotional contagion in live streams : sentiment in live video oral transcripts and viewers’ text chat is associated with the sentiment in subsequent viewers’ comments . This relationship is stronger between viewers’ chat messages and the subsequent chat than between the oral messages in the video and the subsequent chat . However , in some types of live streams , negative sentiment in the live video is followed by less negative chat . We conclude with a discussion of future research and potential uses of the dataset . INTRODUCTION Live streaming is an emergent social medium that enables individuals to interact in real - time via multiple communication modals , such as emojis , text , and video [ 20 ] . Users report that they do a variety of activities in live streams , such as chatting , playing games , cooking , and showing their environment . In regard to interactions between viewers and the streamer , emotional reactions and expression are frequently reported [ 5 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] . Audience members shout out , react to the video , and provide emotional support to the streamer or other viewers [ 24 ] .

Step1 : Retrieve Archived Live Stream Retrieved video information including live stream start and end time ( UTC time zone ) , title , channel ID and name , video ID , viewer count , comment count , default language , and topic IDs ( identified as Freebase IDs ) . Step 2 : Retrieve Video Transcripts 1 ) Assign sentiment values as matched to “Jockers and Rinker Polarity Lookup Table” from the lexicon R package [ 22 ] . 2 ) Construct a “naive context” cluster by adding the n words before and after the sentiment ( in this work , we set the cluster size as five , namely two words before and after the sentiment ) . Here is an excerpt of captions in JSON format : " 282 . 86 " : { " text " : " to the law is very wrong what they do " , " start " : 282 . 86 , " duration " : 7 . 46 } In the caption “to the law is very wrong what they do , ” the cluster around the identified sentiment word “wrong” would be “is very wrong what they . ” 3 ) The raw sentiment of each cluster is weighted by the presence of valence shifters : Negator : - 1 . 00 , Amplifier : 1 . 50 , De - amplifier : 0 . 50 , Adversative conjunction : 0 . 25 [ 12 ] . The weighted sentiment of this cluster by is computed by multiplying the sentiment value and the product of all vector elements in weights . People reported that they feel emotionally and socially connected to live streams that involve a person or place they are concerned about [ 7 ] . These findings indicate that emotion is an important attribute of live streaming . Furthermore , a viewer’s emotion might be affected by the emotions expressed by the streamer or other viewers . This relationship between people’s emotional states is called emotional contagion [ 10 ] . Studies have shown emotional contagions not only in face - to - face communication , but also in online environments where people talk via text without visual cues [ 6 ] [ 9 ] and on large social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook [ 1 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 13 ] . Studying the relationship of viewer - viewer and viewer - streamer sentiment can help us understand how the content on this medium shapes people’s behaviors . It can also inspire approaches of intervention in cases where negative emotions spread by contagion . This study aims to investigate whether emotional contagion takes place in language used in live streaming , and to determine who contributes to this phenomenon . Live streaming usually integrates a live video and a text chat channel ( Figure 1 ) . Previous work has shown that prior audience activities are correlated with subsequent ones [ 19 ] . We hypothesize that a similar relationship will be found between the oral content of the video and subsequent audience messages . Thus , we propose the following hypotheses : H1 : The presence of a certain sentiment in viewers’ chat messages will be correlated with the chance of other viewers expressing this sentiment . H2 : The presence of a certain sentiment in utterances in live video will be correlated with the chance of other viewers expressing this sentiment . DATA COLLECTION The purpose of this study is to investigate whether utterances in the live video and audiences’ chat are correlated with the sentiment of later chat messages . We used YouTube as the data source because ( a ) it archives rich information , such as meta data and chat replay ; ( b ) It covers a wide range of topics such as lifestyle , music , and gaming ; and ( c ) it provides auto - generated captions for a large number of videos . We broke the process of data collection and preprocessing down into multiple stages , as discussed below . Step1 : Retrieve Archived Live Stream Because the archived chat replay feature was enabled since 2018 , we first collected the information of English live streams since 2018 via YouTube API [ 23 ] . . Based on streamer’s self - selected categories and YouTube algorithms , videos can generally be categorized into eight topics : Entertainment ( i . e . film , TV Program ) , Gaming ( i . e . action games , adventure games ) , Knowledge , Lifestyle ( i . e . health , vehicles , technology ) , Music ( i . e . hip hop music , jazz ) , Politics ( i . e . president’s press conference ) , Society ( i . e . religious lectures , social news ) , and Sports ( i . e . football , baseball ) . Step 2 : Retrieve Archived Live Video Transcripts and Compute Sentiment We wrote a script to access the transcripts of retrieved videos via the YouTube API . To solve the problem of missing punctuation in auto - generated YouTube transcripts , we applied the “naïve context” extractor method [ 12 ] .

Pos : 0 . 38 Neg : 0 . 18 This approach computes sentiment values by word clusters and takes valence shifters into account . Details are in the side column . It is worth noting that we computed the sentiment directions ( i . e . positive or negative ) instead of identifying specific emotions ( i . e . anger , sadness ) because the former is more robust using currently available tools . Step 3 : Retrieve Archived Live Chat Replay and Compute Sentiment We created python scripts to access the chat replay of live streams retrieved in the first step using Beautiful Soup . Each chat replay contains the following information : timestamp ( UTC time zone ) , username , message text , message type , and purchase amount . We only have access to those that have chat replay available . Since the content of live stream chat is more similar to social media content such as microblogging , we chose Vader , a sentiment analysis tool that is especially attuned for social media [ 10 ] . After computing the sentiment values of transcripts and live chat , we combined the two using timestamps . If multiple chat messages were sent at the same time , we merged them and averaged the sentiment values . We originally retrieved information for 2176 archived live videos . However , there are huge variances among videos in terms of number of chat messages , duration , number of authors , etc . We removed videos that had fewer than 10 unique authors ( the audience members who send messages in the chat ) , had fewer than 50 chat messages , or lasted less than 15 minutes . Most of these videos are for testing purpose based on authors’ qualitative investigation . To remove the influence of live stream that last hours , we only considered the messages in the first two hours . EMOTIONAL CONTAGION IN LIVE STREAM CHAT To analyze the effect of a specific sentiment on the messages following it , we employed a similar method to Seering et al . [ 19 ] by grouping messages into clusters . Because transcripts do not contain punctuation , we did not group by counting numbers of messages , but by the period of time before and after a message . For each message , we grouped the chat messages 15 seconds before it and counted the percentage of each sentiment in these messages to establish a prior state . We did the same grouping to establish the prior state of transcripts for each sentiment . We then grouped the chat messages 15 seconds after the message and counted the percentage of each sentiment to establish the subsequent state . Figure 2 showed one example of message clustering . We included all messages that had at least four transcript clusters before them and four chat messages before and after them , resulting 1196 videos and 305 , 202 messages in our corpus . Variables used in this study are in Table 2 . Effects of Prior State We conducted multiple linear regressions with the percentage of positive or negative sentiment in the subsequent 15 seconds as a dependent variable . Independent variables were the prior state of transcripts and the prior state of chat . Positive and negative messages are modeled separately . Table 3 shows the result of the model . We found that both the previous chat message and the video transcripts have an impact on the subsequent content . Since the mean is centered by zero , we Poster Presentation CSCW ' 20 Companion , October 17 – 21 , 2020 , Virtual Event , USA 265 Table 3 : Regression models explaining the effects of previous utterances from the streamer and chat messages from the audience Independent Variables Positive Negative Intercept 0 . 0 % 0 . 0 % Prior State of Transcript 9 . 35 % * * * - 5 . 45 % * * * Prior State of Chat 41 . 00 % * * * 39 . 73 % * * * N = 305202 R 2 = 0 . 19 R 2 = 0 . 17 Note : * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 , * * * p < 0 . 001 Table 4 : Regression models across multiple stream topics Stream Type Prior State Transcript Prior State of Chat POS NEG POS NEG Entmt 7 . 24 % * - 2 . 28 % * 48 . 52 % * 33 . 64 % * Gaming 8 . 77 % * 1 . 68 % * 29 . 92 % * 31 . 64 % * Knwl 14 . 58 % * 10 . 64 % * 31 . 85 % * 38 . 36 % * Lifestyle 6 . 64 % * 1 . 27 % * 41 . 52 % * 32 . 29 % * Music 18 . 1 % * - 3 . 33 % * 69 . 31 % * 34 . 59 % * Politics - 20 . 67 % * - 17 . 52 % * 14 . 17 % * 14 . 89 % * Society 15 . 1 % * - 2 . 69 % * 23 . 04 % * 32 . 1 % * Sports - 7 . 81 % * 3 . 71 % * 29 . 59 % * 20 . 94 % * N = 305202 Note : * p < 0 . 001 Figure 3 : Live Chat Sentiment POS / NEG ratio across types can find the prior state of chat messages is a stronger indicator for both positive and negative sentiment . This means that sentiment from other audience members has more impact than the sentiment of the streamer . According to the model , the percentage of positive chat messages in the subsequent 15 seconds is 9 . 35 % times the percentage of the previous 15 seconds of oral messages from the video , plus 41 % times of the percentage of positive messages from the audience . Interestingly , the ratio of negative messages in the subsequent chat is negatively correlated with that from the video , which means that when live videos contain more negative utterances , the percentage of negative messages in the chat will decrease while it will increase if the previous audience chat contains negative sentiment . Effects of Types To determine whether the topics of live streams affected the results , we ran separate multiple regression models for different topics . We found that in Politics streams , the percentage of both positive and negative chat in the previous transcripts were negatively correlated with that in subsequent positive chat . Positive video transcripts were also negatively correlated with subsequent positive chat in Sports streams . In contrast , negative video transcripts in Music , Entertainment , and Society streams were associated with a decrease in subsequent negative chat . These results may be caused by communication styles in different communities . As Figure 3 shows , Entertainment , Lifestyle and Music streams have a high ratio of positive chat messages . One explanation is the effect of positive bias , or “Pollyanna hypothesis , ” meaning that individuals tend to broadcast positive information but neglect negative ones [ 1 ] . Perhaps most audiences in these channels are fans or subscribers , who send messages to show support . The ratio is more even in Sports and Politics streams , where audiences may have opposite preferences and opinions . Another explanation is homophily . It is not clear whether people who share similar emotional state come to the same stream , or the live stream affects viewers’ emotions . Streamers might not be concerned that their negative language has an impact on their audiences . if they want to have an overall positive sentiment in their chatroom , expressing more positive content will be helpful . CONCLUSIONS In this work , we find evidence of emotional contagion in live streams : the sentiment of subsequent chat messages is correlated with previous chat messages from viewers and oral messages from the videos . In general , viewers’ chat is a stronger predictor of subsequent chat messages than oral messages in live videos but the results vary across types of live streams . While our results support the conclusion that emotional contagion occurs in live streaming , we cannot rule out alternative theories such as verbal mimicry [ 20 ] . Future work might include psychophysiological measures to determine whether there are correlations between internal states as well as word use . For designers of live stream systems , it is interesting to further investigate the community norms and interactions across various types of streams . This work only investigates the effects of language used in the live stream instead of other media . As a multi - modal communication channel , streamers’ tone , pause , and body language may also affect viewers’ sentiment . Future work can extend the current dataset and use other technologies to explore these effects .
