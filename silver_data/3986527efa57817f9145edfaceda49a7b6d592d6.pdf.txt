The clathrin machinery classically has a role in the internal­ ization of transmembrane proteins from the plasma membrane into the cell and is frequently manipulated by pathogens at different stages of their replication cycles . It has therefore become increasingly important to under­ stand the function of clathrin and how it is manipulated and specifically regulated in the case of each pathogen . Not only is this relevant for exploring the therapeutic potential of clathrin , but it can also yield further insights into the role of clathrin in cellular processes outside the context of infection . Consequently , studying clathrin during infection is relevant to both microbiologists and cell biologists alike . Owing to the wealth of new concepts and emerging roles for clathrin , it seems particularly appropriate at this juncture to review our current knowledge of clath­ rin manipulation by pathogens . This Review discusses the classic function of clathrin and the role of actin within clathrin­associated processes , before exploring the manipulation of clathrin during the internalization , egress and spread of several different pathogens . Each example highlights the use of clathrin and its associated proteins in distinct but related ways to provide a selective advantage to the associated pathogen . Canonical functions of clathrin The first described function of clathrin was in endo­ cytosis , a process whereby cargo is trafficked from the plasma membrane into the cell in inward­budding vesi­ cles 1 , 2 . This process is important for regulating the levels of cell surface receptors , the uptake of nutrients , synaptic transmission , and the redistribution of transmembrane proteins and lipids to other locations in the cell 1 . Clathrin constitutes the coat of the inward­budding vesicle and is composed of three heavy chains and three light chains that , together , form a characteristic triskelion shape ( FIG . 1 ) . During endocytosis , the triskelia interact , creating a polyhedral lattice that provides structural support to the vesicle 3 . Clathrin­mediated endocytosis ( CME ) in mammalian cells consists of stages of nucleation , cargo selection , coat assembly and invagination , before the eventual scission of the cargo­containing vesicle from the plasma mem­ brane ( FIG . 1 ) . Clathrin does not bind directly to lipids or cargo and thus requires additional proteins to promote triskelion recruitment , cargo sequestration and vesicle formation 4 . One such protein is adaptor protein com­ plex 2 ( AP2 ) , a heterotetrameric complex — consisting of two large subunits ( ~ 100 kDa each ) , one medium subunit ( ~ 50 kDa ) and one small subunit ( ~ 17 kDa ) — that fulfils an adaptor function for clathrin , specifically at the plasma membrane 5 , 6 . AP2 binds to the clathrin heavy chain via a clathrin box motif , LΦXΦ ( D / E ) ( in which Φ represents a bulky hydrophobic residue and X represents any amino acid ) 7 . AP2 also binds motifs in the cytoplasmic tail of transmembrane proteins ; the most common of these motifs are tyrosine or dileucine based and have the consensus signatures YXXΦ or ( D / E ) XXXL ( L / I ) , respectively . These motifs provide the signal to promote selective incorporation of the protein into the invaginating pit 8 – 11 . Thus , AP2 acts as a bridge connecting the clathrin coat to its cargo . In fact , it has recently been shown that the primary event in vesicle formation is the coordinated arrival of one clathrin The non - canonical roles of clathrin and actin in pathogen internalization , egress and spread Ashley C . Humphries and Michael Way Abstract | The role of clathrin in pathogen entry has received much attention and has highlighted the adaptability of clathrin during internalization . Recent studies have now uncovered additional roles for clathrin and have put the spotlight on its role in pathogen spread . Here , we discuss the manipulation of clathrin by pathogens , with specific attention to the processes that occur at the plasma membrane . In the majority of cases , both clathrin and the actin cytoskeleton are hijacked , so we also examine the interplay between these two systems and their role during pathogen internalization , egress and spread .

The progression to form a vesicle is then reliant on the rim complex , which consists of FCHO1 / 2 , EGFR substrate 15 ( EPS15 ) , epsin and intersectin 13 . The rim complex localizes to the edge of the growing vesicle , where it stabilizes the assembling coat and promotes further growth of the clathrin lattice . Some of these pro­ teins also regulate deformation of the membrane to assist invagination , further supporting vesicle formation Outside of its role at the plasma membrane , clathrin functions at the Golgi and on endosomes . In all of these locations , clathrin fulfils a similar function in selectively sorting cargo for trafficking . These processes are coordi­ nated by an overlapping set of endocytic proteins , but are regulated by distinct adaptors , including members of the AP and GGA families . As this Review focuses predomi­ nantly on events at the plasma membrane , readers are directed to other reviews for further details concerning the adaptors and their roles at different subcellular locations 14 – 16 . Actin during endocytosis It is well established that CME in yeast occurs in an actin­dependent manner 17 . By contrast , the role of actin in mammalian endocytosis has been somewhat contro­ versial . Live imaging showed that actin is recruited near the end of the lifetime of the invaginating pit , suggest­ ing that actin plays a part in vesicle scission 17 , 18 . In line with this , electron microscopy data show that actin fila­ ments form a collar­like structure around the neck of the growing vesicle 19 . These data support a role for actin polymerization in neck elongation , vesicle scission and the subsequent movement of the vesicle into the cell 20 ( FIG . 1 ) . The controversy over the role of actin arose owing to the varying degree of disruption to CME when actin polymerization is inhibited 21 – 23 . Subsequent studies have now provided an explanation for this variability , and it seems that actin is required only when membrane tension is high , such as at the adherent surface of the cell 24 – 28 . Consistent with this tension­based dependence on actin , reducing the high turgor pressure eliminates the need for actin during endocytosis in yeast 29 . Figure 1 | Stages of mammalian clathrin - mediated endocytosis . a | Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is defined by stages of nucleation , cargo selection , coat assembly and scission . Nucleation occurs at phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) - rich sites in the plasma membrane , with the coordinated arrival of adaptor protein complex 2 ( AP2 ) and clathrin . AP2 selectively sequesters cargo and recruits further accessory proteins . The rim complex proteins localize to the edge of the growing vesicle and promote lattice formation as well as invagination . In turn , the growing clathrin lattice supports membrane invagination to promote vesicle formation . Scission requires the GTPase dynamin and allows the subsequent movement of the vesicle and cargo into the cell . Actin is required during the final stages , and the recruitment of actin coincides with the arrival of dynamin at the vesicle neck . Actin nucleation occurs in an actin - related protein 2 / 3 ( ARP2 / 3 ) complex - dependent manner , leading to the formation of branched actin filaments at the vesicle site . ARP2 / 3 complex activity is regulated indirectly by dynamin and directly through cortactin and neural Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( N - WASP ) . HIP1 related protein ( HIP1R ) also interacts with cortactin to modulate actin polymerization . During endocytosis , actin filament barbed ends are focused towards the neck of the vesicle to provide force and promote neck elongation and scission . After scission , actin also promotes the inward propulsion of the vesicle away from the membrane into the cell . b | As well as the classic pit organization , clathrin can form extended flat lattices , which can be seen in the micrograph . The factors that regulate this organization , as well as the role of such structures , remain poorly understood . Part b image courtesy of J .

All rights reserved In both yeast and mammalian cells , the seven­subunit actin­related protein 2 / 3 ( ARP2 / 3 ) complex regulates the formation of a branched actin network at sites of endo­ cytosis 17 , 30 . In mammalian cells , a number of proteins have been linked to the regulation of ARP2 / 3­dependent actin polymerization during endocytosis , including dynamin , cortactin , HIP1­related protein ( HIP1R ) and neural Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( N­WASP ) 31 – 33 ( FIG . 1a ) . Dynamin is thought to oligomerize around the neck of the invaginated vesicle and is required for vesicle scission from the plasma membrane 34 , 35 . Dynamin might also coordinate actin nucleation , as it interacts with cortactin , a well­known regulator of the ARP2 / 3 com­ plex 17 , 36 – 39 . Additional regulation of actin polymeriz ation is provided by HIP1R , which was thought to tether the actin cytoskeleton to clathrin 40 , 41 . It is likely , however , that HIP1R binding to clathrin light chains and to actin fila­ ments is sequential , as the former interaction negatively regulates the latter 42 . In line with this , levels of HIP1R are low during formation of the clathrin­coated pit , but dramatically increase during scission 18 . HIP1R also inter­ acts with cortactin and inhibits the interaction of this protein with N­WASP , dynamin and the ARP2 / 3 com­ plex 43 . The interaction with cortactin seems to regulate both the location and extent of actin polymerization and thus ensures that actin nucleation is restricted to sites such as the vesicle neck 43 . However , additional regula­ tors of both HIP1R and the ARP2 / 3 complex must be involved at the endocytic site , as only modest defects in CME are observed in the absence of cortactin 44 . The connection between clathrin and the actin cytoskeleton was further reinforced with the identifi­ cation of longer­lived clathrin structures at the plasma membrane 27 . These structures , which adopt an extended flat lattice of clathrin along the membrane rather than forming a classic pit invagination , have been termed plaques ( FIG . 1b ) . Clathrin plaques are observed at the adherent surface of cells , suggesting that they only form in situations of high membrane tension . Consistent with this , they require actin for internalization 27 . Furthermore , large actin­dependent clathrin assemblies have also been linked to integrin­mediated cell spread­ ing 45 . However , in contrast to this notion , a similar flat clathrin arrangement is observed on endosomal mem­ branes , where it concentrates ubiquitylated proteins into specific microdomains 46 – 50 . It is unclear what coordinates the flat clathrin lattice arrangement , but it is possible that this different organization arises owing to an alternative arrangement of endocytic proteins within these struc­ tures . For example , epsin , which promotes membrane curvature , is distributed throughout the lattice , rather than being concentrated at the rim , as in classic endo­ cytosis 27 , 51 , 52 . Epsin also regulates the recruitment of HIP1R to clathrin­coated pits in Dictyostelium discoi - deum and can modulate both the location and timing of actin nucleation 53 , 54 . Together , this supports the concept that it is the organization of endocytic proteins , such as epsin , that dictates the final supermolecular arrange­ ment of clathrin . However , the proteins and associated interactions that influence the structural configuration and function of clathrin remain unknown . Clathrin and pathogen entry Intracellular pathogens exploit or are dependent on the cellular systems of their host for their survival , replica­ tion and spread 55 – 58 . Studies exploring how pathogens hijack their host have led to a greater understanding of not only pathogenesis but also the inner workings of the cell . Pathogens exploit a number of endocytic path­ ways for their internalization , and these processes have been described comprehensively in a number of excel­ lent reviews 59 – 63 . Among the endocytic pathways are the actin­dependent processes of macropinocytosis and phagocytosis . Macropinocytosis is normally triggered through growth factor signalling , leading to the forma­ tion of membrane ruffles , which can present as filo podia or blebs , depending on the cell type and stimulation . A macropinosome is then formed when the membrane extension folds back and fuses with the plasma mem­ brane , and these compartments can thus vary in shape and have a diameter of up to 10 μm 64 , 65 . By contrast , phagocytosis is stimulated by binding of a particle to the cell surface , which guides the actin­dependent formation of a tight endocytic vacuole around its surface 64 . The two processes have several features in common , but integral to their use during pathogen internalization is their large vacuole size . Many pathogens also exploit CME to facili­ tate their entry into cells , and although these pathogens hijack the classic CME function , studies of pathogen internalization have helped us to appreciate the flexibility of the clathrin molecule 59 . In non­infected cells , clathrin­coated vesicles typi­ cally range in size from 30 nm to 150 nm , and calcu­ lations based on the steric constraints of the clathrin molecule have estimated 150 nm to be the upper size limit of the vesicle 66 – 69 . Internalization of bacterial patho­ gens , however , provided the first indication that clathrin could accommodate particles larger than 150 nm , and studies with vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) elegantly uncovered how this can occur 70 – 72 . VSV , which is 200 nm long , enters cells in an actin­dependent manner through partially clathrin­coated vesicles 70 . By contrast , a mutant virus that is 75 nm in length gains entry within a complete clathrin coat in an actin­independent manner 71 . On the basis of these and other observations , it seems that actin polymerization in conjunction with clathrin­mediated endocytosis provides the driving force to internalize large particles such as pathogens , which can be more than 1 μm in diameter 73 – 75 . Nevertheless , despite the abil­ ity to accommodate sizes greater than originally appreci­ ated , clathrin still carries out a canonical function during pathogen internalization 59 , 71 , 76 , 77 . Putting clathrin on a pedestal In recent years , exciting data have emerged linking path­ ogen­induced actin nucleation with the exploitation of clathrin in a non­canonical role . A prime example of this is clathrin exploitation by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli ( EPEC ) , a bacterial pathogen that adheres to the cell surface but does not enter the host cell 78 . On binding , EPEC inserts a bacterial protein , translocated intimin receptor ( Tir ) , into the plasma membrane , and the pro­ tein is subsequently clustered by intimin on the bacterial R E V I E W S NATURE REVIEWS | MICROBIOLOGY VOLUME 11 | AUGUST 2013 | 553 © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Clustering of Tir in the plasma membrane leads to its phosphorylation on tyrosine residues 474 and 454 by SRC and ABL family kinases 80 , 81 . Phosphorylation of tyrosine 474 results in the recruitment of NCK and , consequently , N­WASP , as well as an additional NCK­ independent pathway downstream of tyrosine 474 and tyrosine 454 phosphorylation contributing to N­WASP recruitment 82 – 85 . N­WASP then recruits the ARP2 / 3 complex , which stimulates actin polymerization to form a pedestal beneath the bacterium . Thus , both N­WASP and the ARP2 / 3 complex are required for pedestal formation 83 , 86 , 87 . The first observation of a link to the clathrin machinery was the discovery that dynamin is recruited to and has a role in EPEC­mediated pedestal formation 88 . However , it was not until clathrin itself was found to be recruited and to regulate actin pedestal formation that the role of the endocytic machinery in this process was uncovered 75 . Clathrin is recruited downstream of NCK and was found to constitute part of the signalling complex required for actin polymerization 75 . A subsequent study set out to identify the endocytic proteins that also form part of this signalling network , and found that AP2 was neither recruited nor required for actin pedestal formation 89 . The same study revealed that an alternative adaptor , DAB2 , together with the rim complex proteins epsin 1 and ESP15 , was required for clathrin recruitment 89 ( FIG . 2 ) . Conserved clathrin machinery A similar set of proteins to those required for actin pedestal formation have also been shown to play a part in the internalization of the ‘zippering’ bacterium Listeria monocytogenes 59 , 75 . Zippering bacteria promote their internalization through the surface expression of invasion proteins that interact with cellular receptors . This interaction leads to signalling events that promote actin nucleation at the plasma membrane to engulf the bacterium 90 . To date , the endocytic proteins that have been shown to regulate both EPEC pedestal formation and L . monocytogenes entry include clathrin , DAB2 , dynamin , EPS15 , HIP1R , cortactin and the cortactin­ interacting protein CD2AP ; in addition , both processes occur in an AP2­independent manner 75 , 89 – 94 ( FIG . 2 ) . It was also recently demonstrated that SRC­dependent phosphorylation of the clathrin heavy chain is required for both L . monocytogenes entry and actin accumulation beneath EPEC 94 , 95 . This has led to the suggestion that phosphorylation stabilizes clathrin beneath the bacterium . In support of this , ligand binding to epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) and low­affinity nerve growth factor receptor ( NGFR ) has been shown to stimulate SRC acti­ vation and phosphorylation of the clathrin heavy chain , enhancing its localization to the plasma membrane 96 , 97 . It is therefore highly likely that phosphorylation of the clathrin heavy chain regulates temporal stages of the endo­ cytic process 77 . In support of this , SRC activation is also required for the recruitment of clathrin to adherens junctions 95 . Adherens junctions are the most common type of intercellular adhesion and bridge the actin cyto­ skeleton of neighbouring cells 98 . A number of proteins form the adhesion , but E­cadherin plays an essential role in creating homodimers across the cell junction 99 . It was observed that clathrin localizes to adherens junctions and regulates their maturation by creating a stable platform Figure 2 | The conserved use of endocytic proteins by Listeria monocytogenes and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli . During infection , Listeria monocytogenes and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli ( EPEC ) hijack a conserved set of endocytic proteins to promote bacterial internalization and actin pedestal formation , respectively . The adaptor DAB2 acts with the rim complex protein epsin 1 to regulate clathrin recruitment to EPEC , whereas L . monocytogenes uses only DAB2 . Phosphorylation of the clathrin heavy chain stabilizes the clathrin coat , forming a platform for recruitment of the cytoskeletal machinery .

All rights reserved for the recruitment of cytoskeletal proteins , in a manner reminiscent of L . monocytogenes and EPEC 94 ( FIG . 2 ) . It was additionally shown that DAB2 and HIP1R are required for L . mono cytogenes internalization and EPEC pedestal formation , and E­cadherin is also known to have a role during L . monocytogenes internalization 73 , 100 . Together , this suggests that a common core of clathrin­mediated machinery regulates pedestal formation , pathogen inter­ nalization and / or cell adhesion according to the temporal and spatial organization of associated proteins 94 , 101 ( TABLE 1 ) . Differential use of adaptors Neither L . monocytogenes nor EPEC use the canonical plasma membrane adaptor AP2 to recruit clathrin . In fact , the cargo­specific adaptors DAB2 and epsin are preferred . DAB2 is a monomeric adaptor that can func­ tion independently of AP2 to facilitate endocytosis of low­density lipoprotein ( LDL ) receptor 102 – 104 . Epsin contains ubiquitin­interacting motifs that promote the internalization of proteins such as EGFR when they are ubiquitylated following ligand binding 105 , 106 . DAB2 and epsin can function as adaptors by virtue of their capacity to bind several endocytic molecules , and both promote clathrin vesicle formation 104 , 107 – 112 . These adaptors have also been implicated in the formation of clathrin plaques at the plasma membrane 27 , 45 . This suggests that the abil­ ity of DAB2 and epsin to coordinate the formation of stable clathrin assemblies that are intimately associated with actin nucleation is a driver behind the use of these adaptors during pathogen internalization and pedestal formation 95 . In both cases , clathrin seems to act as a plat­ form for cytoskeletal arrangements , reminiscent of the role of clathrin plaques . In general , it remains unclear how different adaptors are selected for use during clathrin­mediated endocyto­ sis . DAB2 and AP2 are present in the same clathrin­coated vesicles , although each adaptor can interact with a dis­ tinct cargo 107 . The use of alternative adaptors by different pathogens is intriguing and suggests that the differ­ ent properties of these adaptors lead to the formation of distinct clathrin structures , depending on the associ­ ated host factors . In the future , studies with pathogens might help to unravel how different adaptors function to organize distinct clathrin structures , in the same way they have helped to elucidate the signalling networks that regulate actin polymerization 113 . Pathogens can hijack cellular adaptors ; however , interestingly , there are very few examples to date of viral adaptor mimics 114 , 115 . One example is the large hepatitis delta antigen ( HDAg­L ) , which functions as a clathrin adaptor to promote hepatitis delta virus assembly 115 . HDAg­L contains a clathrin box motif that can interact with the clathrin heavy chain at the trans ­Golgi network ( TGN ) to promote viral morphogenesis 115 – 117 . As encoding an adaptor mimic allows the virus to have unreserved control over clathrin , it would be very surprising if there were not further viral adaptor mimics remaining to be identified . These mimics might also function alongside the non­canonical adaptors — that is , DAB2 and epsin — to promote distinct organizations of clathrin that fulfil the precise needs of the pathogen . Shigella flexneri : the ins and outs of clathrin The main examples of the use of clathrin in microbiology have been to promote efficient pathogen internalization . However , as mentioned earlier , there is now a growing list of pathogens that manipulate clathrin to promote their spread . The non­canonical function of clathrin in the engulfment of Shigella flexneri takes advantage of the flexibility of clathrin to accommodate this micrometre­ sized bacterium 118 . S . flexneri is a Gram­negative bacterium that nucleates actin when the pathogen is in the cyto­ plasm of the cell 113 . This actin­based motility enhances cell – cell spread by propelling the bacterium to the cell periphery , where it pushes against the plasma mem­ brane , creating a pseudopodium protrusion that is engulfed by the neighbouring cell 90 . Recent data have now shown that clathrin functions with epsin 1 to engulf the extending pseudopod and promote S . flexneri cell – cell spread 118 . This occurs preferentially at epithelial tri­ cellular junctions , where three epithelial cells are in contact . It remains to be determined what guides this preference and how clathrin recruitment is stimulated . However , this restricted localization suggests that cell – cell adhesion sites , which undergo active remodelling , are Table 1 | Endocytic proteins that are hijacked by pathogens Pathogen Adaptors Additional proteins Function Refs EPEC DAB2 , epsin 1 CD2AP , clathrin , cortactin , dynamin , EPS15 , HIP1R Actin pedestal formation 74 , 87 , 88 , 91 , 93 HIV , SIV AP2 , AP1 Clathrin Viral budding , tetherin downregulation 113 , 155 , 156 , 163 Listeria monocytogenes DAB2 CD2AP , clathrin , cortactin , dynamin , EPS15 , HIP1R Bacterial internalization 72 , 74 , 90 , 92 , 93 , 99 Rickettsia parkeri Unknown HIP1R Actin tail formation 139 Shigella flexneri Epsin 1 Clathrin , dynamin Bacterial engulfment 117 VV AP2 Clathrin , cortactin Actin tail formation , viral release 118 , 120 VSV AP2 , unknown Clathrin , dynamin Viral internalization 72 AP , adaptor protein complex ; EPEC , enteropathogenic Escherichia coli ; EPS15 , epidermal growth factor receptor substrate 15 ; HIP1R , HIP1 - related protein ; SIV , simian immunodeficiency virus ; VSV , vesicular stomatitis virus ; VV , vaccinia virus .

Interestingly , the endocytic proteins required for S . flexneri cell­cell spread are again reminiscent of those hijacked during L . monocytogenes and EPEC infection . Clathrin in actin tail formation Vaccinia virus , the prototypical member of the family Poxviridae , also recruits clathrin to augment viral spread 119 ( FIG . 3 ) . Clathrin was found to enhance actin polymeri­ zation , promoting faster and more efficient formation of actin tails , structures that are analogous to EPEC­ induced actin pedestals 113 , 120 , 121 . During the vaccinia virus replication cycle , some newly assembled virions become wrapped by an additional double membrane containing several viral proteins , which is derived from either the TGN or endosomes 122 – 124 . The virus is then permissive for kinesin 1­dependent transport to the cell periphery on microtubules , before it fuses with the plasma membrane 125 – 130 . Fusion leads to an outside­in sig­ nalling cascade , activating SRC and ABL family kinases that phosphorylate tyrosine residues 112 and 132 of the viral transmembrane protein A36 ( REFS 126 , 131 – 134 ) . This stimulates the recruitment of a signalling network consisting of NCK , growth factor receptor­bound 2 ( GRB2 ) , WASP­interacting protein ( WIP ; also known as WIPF1 ) and N­WASP to activate the ARP2 / 3 com­ plex , and thus induce the formation of actin tails and promote cell – cell spread of the virus 131 , 132 , 135 – 139 . Clathrin is recruited to vaccinia virus in a transient manner in the moments leading up to actin nucleation , and unlike at EPEC­induced actin pedestals , clathrin does not remain associated with the virus­induced actin tails 119 . Clathrin plays an organizational role , clustering A36 to create a polarized viral­protein platform that is efficient in stabilizing the actin­signalling complex beneath the virus 119 . In many ways , vaccinia virus exploits the early stages of CME by the selective sequestration of A36 . This contrasts with EPEC , which mimics the later stages of clathrin function by promoting the recruitment of the actin machinery ( FIG . 3 ) . Interestingly , vaccinia virus might not be the only pathogen to make use of clathrin in this way . As observed with the loss of AP2 in vaccinia virus­infected cells , the bacterial pathogen Rickettsia parkeri induces fewer but longer actin tails when HIP1R levels are depleted 119 , 140 . For vaccinia virus , the changes to actin tail morphology that are induced by AP2 depletion are a consequence of reduced clustering of A36 and its down­ stream signalling network . However , a possible role for HIP1R in vaccinia virus­induced actin tail formation has not been examined . It also remains to be deter­ mined whether clathrin functions upstream of HIP1R in R . parkeri ­induced actin tail formation and whether it regulates actin polymerization in a direct or indirect manner . Ultimately , time will tell whether R . parkeri is a further example of a pathogen that can both induce actin nucleation and manipulate the endocytic machinery to promote pathogen spread . Clathrin and vaccinia virus release In addition to its role in actin­dependent spread , clath­ rin has been implicated in the regulation of vaccinia virus release 141 – 143 . During egress , the outer viral mem­ brane fuses directly with the plasma membrane , and the virus remains intimately associated with the cell 124 . This attachment is mediated by interactions between viral proteins in the membrane around the extra cellular virus , as well as between those incorporated into the plasma membrane during viral fusion 124 , 144 . Consistent with this hypothesis , mutations in the luminal domain of the viral proteins B5 and A34 , as well as deletion of the carboxy­ terminal domain of the viral protein A33 , result in increased vaccinia virus release 145 – 147 . It was recently Figure 3 | Platforms for cytoskeletal rearrangements by vaccinia virus and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli . Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli ( EPEC ) and vaccinia virus both recruit clathrin to promote pathogen - induced actin nucleation . In the case of EPEC , clathrin forms a stable signalling scaffold as part of the signalling network required to recruit the actin machinery . By contrast , vaccinia virus transiently recruits clathrin before actin nucleation . When the outer vaccinia virus membrane fuses with the plasma membrane , the viral transmembrane protein A36 becomes incorporated into the plasma membrane . Clathrin recruitment then acts to cluster A36 beneath the virus , establishing a protein platform for subsequent recruitment of the actin machinery . In line with these different roles of clathrin , different adaptor proteins are used by each pathogen . EPEC recruits clathrin in a DAB2 - dependent manner , whereas vaccinia virus recruits clathrin in an adaptor protein complex 2 ( AP2 ) - dependent manner .

All rights reserved Nature Reviews | Microbiology ESCRT Env Gag vRNA Tetherin Clathrin AP2 AP1 F - actin suggested that actin polymerization also regulates release by disrupting these luminal interactions 141 . Actin nucleation promotes the redistribution of A36 to a focused space beneath vaccinia virus , thereby reduc­ ing the interface between the virus and host cell 141 . As clathrin promotes clustering of A36 beneath the virus , it is likely that clathrin also positively regulates release 119 . Viral proteins that are left in the plasma mem­ brane after release of the virus are recycled back to the Golgi 142 , 143 . Blocking endocytic uptake of these viral pro­ teins affects viral release , but this seems to be an indirect effect that arises from a limitation in the continued pro­ duction of viral particles 143 . Nonetheless , this defect in recycling would still have a considerable impact on the ability of vaccinia virus to spread during the course of infection . The current data therefore suggest that clath­ rin promotes vaccinia virus release in both a direct and an indirect manner . However , as the role of clathrin is to cluster viral proteins , it could be that the recruitment of clathrin to viral particles actually restricts release through triskelion engagement with several viral pro­ teins and through the maintenance of interviral inter­ actions . This could prevent premature viral release from the cell to allow the formation of an actin tail and promote more efficient cell – cell spread . Clathrin might thus have a dual function of facilitating cell – cell spread and weakening the luminal interactions of the virus to enable release . This hypothesis is supported by studies using the vaccinia virus strain IHD­J , which exhibits a higher proportion ( compared with other strains ) of released versus attached particles following fusion and which has lower virulence in mouse models 141 , 148 – 150 . To appreciate the true contribution of clathrin to vaccinia virus release and consequent spread , we need a tempo­ ral understanding of the events that occur at the plasma membrane during infection as a whole . Retroviral budding and release Further examples of pathogens that use clathrin to pro­ mote their spread are retroviruses . These viruses take advantage of clathrin to fulfil several roles during their exit from infected cells . The viral protein Gag plays a major part in budding and can produce virus­like par­ ticles when expressed alone in cells 151 , 152 . Gag mediates budding by interacting with several components of the multivesicular body ESCRT ( endosomal sorting com­ plex required for transport ) machinery using consensus motifs termed late domains 153 . The ESCRT machinery is Figure 4 | Potential roles for the endocytic machinery during retroviral budding . The assembly of retroviruses requires three major components : Gag , envelope protein ( Env ) and the genomic viral RNAs ( vRNAs ) . These components are transported to distinct sites in the plasma membrane , where retroviral assembly and budding occur . Budding is coordinated through late domains in Gag , which facilitate the interaction of Gag with components of the ESCRT ( endosomal sorting complex required for transport ) machinery and thus coordinate outward membrane deformation . The endocytic and cytoskeletal machineries have been implicated in the budding process , but their precise roles remain unclear . To date , proposed mechanisms include the binding of adaptor protein complex 2 ( AP2 ) to Gag to restrict Gag localization to the plasma membrane , as well as binding of AP1 to Gag and components of the ESCRT complex to facilitate budding by an unknown mechanism . In addition , clathrin localizes to the budding site and becomes incorporated into the viral particle , and thus might regulate the spatial organization of viral proteins to facilitate accurate assembly . The cytoskeletal machinery is implicated in providing force to promote efficient assembly and budding ; however , as yet , no interplay between the endocytic proteins and actin has been observed in this system . To allow a progeny virus particle to be released , the host protein tetherin , which physically tethers the particle to the plasma membrane , must be counteracted . Both AP2 and clathrin have been implicated in the removal of tetherin from the budding site .

Endocytic adaptor proteins also contribute to retroviral budding ; for example , AP2 binds to Gag and cooperates with the Gag late domain to promote assembly and release of nascent equine infectious anaemia virions ( EIAV ) 155 . Studies have additionally shown that AP2 binding directs HIV­1 Gag to distinct domains and that an interaction of AP1 ( an equivalent adaptor to AP2 that classically func­ tions at the Golgi ) with both Gag and ESCRT proteins also promotes retroviral budding 156 , 157 . Clathrin incorpo­ ration into budding retroviruses might also reflect a role for clathrin in regulating the spatial organization of viral proteins during the budding process 114 ( FIG . 4 ) . As well as roles for the endocytic machinery , retroviral budding and release has been causally linked to the actin cytoskeleton , although a direct link between the two has yet to be dem­ onstrated 158 – 161 . The role of clathrin and adaptor proteins in retroviral budding is still unclear , and future studies are required to provide insights into the involvement of these proteins and their potential interplay with actin . In the case of retroviruses , the clathrin machinery is also associated with the removal of tetherin from viral assembly and budding sites 162 – 164 . Tetherin is an anti­ viral protein that functions by inserting either of its membrane anchors into the lipid envelope of nascent virions to physically link them to the plasma membrane and restrict their release 165 . Consequently , retroviruses have evolved strategies to counteract the impact of teth­ erin . The viral protein Nef binds AP2 to promote teth­ erin internalization and trafficking to the TGN , trapping the protein intracellularly 164 . The viral protein Vpu also interacts with tetherin and prevents it from trafficking to the plasma membrane 162 . In addition , there is a sugges­ tion that tetherin can be directed to ESCRT­dependent endosomal degradation via a clathrin­dependent mech­ anism 163 . Studies with retroviruses thus show that clath­ rin has a scaffolding function to facilitate viral budding at specialized microdomains , in addition to its canonical role in trafficking , which promotes both budding and tetherin downregulation . Concluding remarks Clathrin has always been appreciated as a structural scaf­ fold that provides support for the developing endocytic vesicle . However , in recent years , studies with a range of pathogens have demonstrated that clathrin can have a more active role in providing a signalling platform . In this way , clathrin orchestrates sequestration and sort­ ing of cargo , as well as recruitment and modulation of the actin­nucleating machinery . However , there remain some outstanding questions , specifically concerning how the clathrin lattice organizes within different struc­ tures and what ultimately controls actin nucleation , both temporally and spatially . The past successful use of pathogens to elucidate signalling networks that regulate actin­based motility suggests that , once again , the study of pathogens might prove effective in answering these unresolved questions . In addition , the frequent manipulation of clathrin by pathogens highlights potential therapeutic targets , particularly as pathogens seem to hijack a specific sub­ set of endocytic proteins . Studies to further understand the manipulation of clathrin during infection will help to guide therapeutic strategies , as well as our appre­ ciation of the coordination and cellular application of clathrin . With this ever­expanding knowledge of how this highly versatile molecule is used in the cell and can be exploited , there will undoubtedly be many more sur­ prises to come , from the viewpoint of microbiologists and cell biologists alike . 1 .
