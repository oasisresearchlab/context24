Recent advances in artiﬁcial intelligence and data science present unprecedented opportunities to mine , analyse and make sense of patent data to develop design theory and methodology . Herein , we survey the patent - for - design literature by their contributions to design theories , methods , tools , and strategies , as well as different forms of patent data and various methods . Our review sheds light on promising future research directions for the ﬁeld . Keywords Patent · Engineering Design · Data - driven Design · Artiﬁcial Intelligence · Data Science 1 Introduction In the engineering design ﬁeld , mining patent data to develop design theory and methodology has a long history , and can be dated back to the 1950s : Altshuller and his team developed the theory of inventive problem solving ( TRIZ ) by manually examining thousands of patent documents [ 1 ] . In the past few decades , advancements in artiﬁcial intelligence ( AI ) and data science techniques present a growing opportunity to mine big data related to engineering design in design research and practice . In contrast to human - curated design repositories [ 2 , 3 ] , patent databases present two advantages for data - driven engineering design . First , patent databases are natural large - scale repositories that accumulate over time as inventors ﬁle patent applications for their inventions . For example , United States Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce ( USPTO ) database contains over 7 . 7 million granted patents from 1963 to 2020 . Second , patents contain massive design information on technologies , systems , or processes from all domains in both textual and visual forms , the innovation activity footprints and collaboration information of inventors and organizations in the bibliometrics , and their relations to prior or future designs in the form of citations . Moreover , every patent is assigned to domain class ( es ) by multiple patent examiners , making patent data ready for supervised machine learning applications . Fig . 1 presents an example patent document and its information structure . ∗ Comments are welcome : jsmech @ sjtu . edu . cn a r X i v : 2111 . 08500v1 [ c s . D L ] 15 N ov 2021 P ATENT D ATA FOR E NGINEERING D ESIGN : A R EVIEW Figure 1 : Example of a patent document ( US Patent 7874513 ) In recent years , several design research groups actively explored cutting - edge data science techniques to mine the patent database for diverse applications , such as design representation , design space exploration , design prior art searching , stimuli recommendation , idea generation and evaluation , and so on [ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] . These patent - for - design studies relied on a broad collection of methods , ranging from classic statistical analysis to latest network analysis , natural language processing ( NLP ) , machine learning and data visualizations . To the best of our knowledge , there is no systematic review of the patent - for - design research despite its rapid growth . Therefore , to elucidate research trends and reveal promising opportunities and future research directions , we conducted this review and benchmarked these studies with the latest data science techniques . 2 Literature Retrieval Methodology To retrieve prior patent - for - design publications , we employed the following search process to ensure comprehensiveness and relevance ( Retrieval Date : Oct 23 , 2021 ) . Figure 2 : Distribution of the patent - for - design literature In the ﬁrst round , we ran a query in Web of Science , focusing on the following engineering design journals : ( 1 ) ASME JMD ( Journal of Mechanical Design ) ; ( 2 ) ASME JCISE ( Journal of Computing and Information Science in Engineering ) ; ( 3 ) RIED ( Research in Engineering Design ) ; ( 4 ) JED ( Journal of Engineering Design ) ; ( 5 ) Design Studies ; ( 6 ) Design Science ; ( 7 ) AI - EDAM ( Artiﬁcial Intelligence for Engineering Design , Analysis and Manufacturing ) ; ( 8 ) CAD ( Computer - Aided Design ) . The following query was used : ( TI = " patent " OR AB = " patent " ) AND ( SO = X ) AND ( PY = 1950 - 2021 ) , where X represents one of the eight journals . The search returned 46 papers . We manually checked these papers and identiﬁed 32 papers that ﬁt the scope of this review . The inclusion criteria are : ( 1 ) Patent data are used as research data in the body text of the paper ; ( 2 ) The paper contributes to engineering design theory or methodology development . These 32 papers form the initial core paper list . In the second round , we went to the journal websites to search for possible missing relevant literature in the ﬁrst round , including recently accepted manuscripts that are relevant to our topic but not yet included in the Web of Science . We 2 P ATENT D ATA FOR E NGINEERING D ESIGN : A R EVIEW queried the search engines of the journal websites with the keyword “patent” . In this round , we found 18 additional relevant papers , bringing the list to 50 papers . In the third round , we removed the journal restraint in the query to conduct a global search in the Web of Science . The following query was used : ( TS = ( ”patent” AND “engineering design” ) ) AND ( PY = 1950 - 2021 ) . Selecting document type as " article " returned 36 papers . Among them , 13 have already been included in the list from previous searches , 6 are about using patent data as engineering design cases for education , which fall out of the scope of this review . From the remaining ones , we identiﬁed 5 relevant papers and added them to the list , leading to a total of 55 papers . Finally , in the fourth round , we further checked the forward and backward citations of the papers in the core list via a snowballing process , and found another 3 relevant papers to add to the list . In sum , we curated a patent - for - design literature list of 58 papers to review . Fig . 2 presents the distributions of these papers by A ) publication years , B ) journals and C ) Key phrases from titles ( weighted by term frequency ) . 3 Applications of Patent Data in Engineering Design Research As we review the patent - for - design literature , it becomes clear that patent data have been utilized to advance ( 1 ) Design Theory ; ( 2 ) Design Methodology ; ( 3 ) Design Tool ; ( 4 ) Design Strategy . Thus , our literature analysis is organised by these four categories . We manually examined design contribution of each study and assigned them into one or multiple categories . Fig . 3 summarizes the literature distribution by their application categories . Figure 3 : The distribution of patent - for - design literature by application domains 3 . 1 Design Theory Research Design theory involves the understanding of the design process and design rules . Busby et al . [ 11 ] conducted an experiment on what factors inﬂuenced solution search activities and used patent database as the searching pool . Weaver et al . [ 12 ] and Singh et al . [ 13 ] developed transformation design principles by examining patents , products and biological cases . Later , many researchers studied Design - by - Analogy ( DbA ) by utilizing patent databases as sources of design stimuli for drawing analogies [ 14 ] . They have examined how the analogical distance [ 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 ] , commonness [ 15 ] , and the modality of examples [ 15 ] inﬂuence the DbA - based ideation outcomes . Similarly , Saliminamin et al . [ 20 ] used patents as idea triggers to explore the effect of precedents and design strategies on idea generation . In addition to the inﬂuential factors on design outcomes , a few recent studies have mined bibliometric , citation and classiﬁcation information of patent documents to reveal the fundamental patterns in designers’ exploratory behaviours [ 21 ] , the causality between design novelty and potential impact [ 22 ] and the growing complexity of the design and invention process [ 23 ] . 3 . 2 Design Methodology Research As seen in Fig . 3 , most patent - for - design literature aimed at developing new design methodologies . The earliest work relied on human expertise and manual efforts to extract design rules or heuristics from patents or use patents as design cases to illustrate design methods [ 11 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 20 , 28 , 19 , 29 , 30 ] . More recent studies used NLP to identify innovative solutions from patent database to design problems to facilitate the use of TRIZ [ 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 ] . Another strand developed design methodologies that leverage design knowledge in patents for design representation 3 P ATENT D ATA FOR E NGINEERING D ESIGN : A R EVIEW and reasoning . For instance , Van Wie et al . [ 35 ] represented engineering products based on the Function - Behaviour - Structure ( FBS ) ontology [ 36 ] by analysing patent documents . Yamamoto et al . [ 37 ] extracted the Subject - Verb - Object tuples from patent texts for function dividing in conceptual design . Fantoni et al . [ 38 ] proposed an approach to extract function – behaviour – state information from patents . Liu et al . [ 39 ] and Liang et al . [ 40 ] proposed a text mining algorithm to discover design rationales from patent documents . Valverde et al . , [ 41 ] create a discovery matrix in which physical phenomena and technologies are matched via patents to inspire engineers . Hwang and Park [ 42 ] developed the design heuristics sets for X ( DHSfXs ) from products and patents , aiming to facilitate concept design for speciﬁc goals . Atherton et al . [ 43 ] proposed a functional representation method using annotation of geometry interaction derived from patent claims , which assists designers to understand prior designs better . Since patent databases are natural repositories of design precedents , methods of retrieving patents as inspirational stimuli to augment design ideation are of the central interest of the conceptual design researchers . For instance , Verhaegen et al . [ 44 ] retrieved candidate patents as product precedents for analogical design by distilling product features . Rios - Zapata et al . [ 45 ] presented a creative design method that fuses combination and mutation models to support patent prior art search and analysis in early design stages . Song et al . [ 18 ] proposed a method for patent stimuli searching based on community detection within a patent class network . Song and Luo [ 46 ] described an approach to retrieve patent precedents for data - driven design by integrating searches through keywords , citation and co - inventor networks . Jiang et al . [ 47 ] presented a framework that can assist designers in comparing prior arts and obtaining inspirations from them . Their framework is built on a functional knowledge graph with human - created ontologies . Liu et al . [ 5 ] proposed a method to extract functional terms from a patent database and processed the terms using clustering algorithms for design ideation . Luo et al . [ 6 ] utilized patent citation - based metrics to measure knowledge distance among different technology domains and proposed workﬂows to search and retrieve design stimuli for analogy and synthesis across domains based on knowledge distance . Speciﬁcally , a group of studies focused on patent data retrieval to support DbA . Linsey et al . [ 48 ] proposed the WordTree method to semantically re - represent design problems based on WordNet and guide designers to ﬁnd potential analogies for innovative design from a set of patents . Fu et al . [ 17 , 49 ] utilized the combination of a Bayesian model and latent semantic analysis ( LSA ) to map a set of patent documents in a network structure to guide patent search for analogical inspirations . Murphy et al . [ 50 ] proposed a functional vector method based on bag - of - words to encode patent documents into high - dimensional vectors to support analogy search . In particular , the latest advances of data science and artiﬁcial intelligence enable the development of automated or semi - automated design methods that process massive patent data . Koza [ 51 ] developed a genetic programming algorithm to solve design problems automatically and utilized patent database to examine the novelty of newly generated solutions . Wodehouse et al . [ 29 ] presented a clustering method to analyse design opportunities using crowd intelligence . Song , Luo , et al . [ 52 ] proposed a data - driven product platform design method based on the core - periphery structure detection within functional word co - occurrence networks that are created from patent texts . Jiang , Luo , et al . [ 4 ] proposed a convolutional neural network - based representation method for design images from patent documents , aiming to facilitate visual DbA . Sarica et al . [ 7 ] presented an idea generation methodology based on a large technology semantic network of over 4 million technical terms based on a word embedding model trained on the patent database [ 53 ] . 3 . 3 Design Tool Development A few recent studies have leveraged patent data to develop data - driven design tools , facilitating and automating relevant design methodologies . Fitzgerald et al . [ 54 ] developed a design - for - environment ( DfE ) tool to manage and facilitate the analysis and reuse of successful products for conceptual design . Their tool is a rule - based system built on TRIZ and DbA . Vandevenne et al . [ 55 ] developed a tool named scalable search for systematic biologically inspired design ( SEABIRD ) , which enables the scalable search for biological stimuli for designers . SEABIRD utilizes rule - based text mining techniques to extract and map product aspects of technical systems in patent documents and organism aspects of biological systems in academic papers for identifying candidate analogies . Mccaffrey [ 56 ] developed Analogy Finder , a DbA support system to identify adaptable semantic analogies from the patent database . Later , Mccaffrey and Spector [ 57 ] devised a visual and verbal problem - solving representation to support human – machine collaboration in innovative design . Luo et al . [ 58 ] developed InnoGPS a cloud - based tool that employs an empirically - built interactive network map of all patent technology classes to guide the search for design inspiration ( from patent texts ) and innovation opportunities in different domains . Using InnoGPS as the basis , Luo and his team proposed a series of data - driven design applications , including design opportunity identiﬁcation [ 58 , 59 ] and analogical conceptual design [ 60 , 6 ] . Siddharth and Chakrabarti [ 28 ] developed the Idea - Inspire 4 . 0 with the validation on patents . Idea - Inspire represents both engineering concepts and biological ideas using SAPPhIRE model ontology [ 61 ] for biologically inspired design . Based on Idea - Inspire tool and SAPPhIRE model , they further developed an automated novelty evaluation method for engineering design solutions [ 62 ] . Song and Fu [ 10 ] utilized a topic modelling algorithm to structure a repository of 4 P ATENT D ATA FOR E NGINEERING D ESIGN : A R EVIEW mechanical design patents with three facets : behaviour , material , and component , and developed a visual interaction tool for seeking design inspiration , named VISION [ 9 ] . Sarica et al . [ 53 ] applied word embedding techniques on patent data and constructed a large - scale technology semantic network of over 4 million terms called TechNet , which is accessible via API and a public web portal . TechNet has been used for design representation [ 63 ] , prior art retrieval [ 64 ] , idea generation [ 7 ] , and concept evaluation [ 65 ] . Siddharth et al . [ 8 ] created a large and scalable engineering knowledge graph based on the entire USPTO database , which can be used to support inference , reasoning , and knowledge exploration in engineering design applications . 3 . 4 Design Strategy Research Patent databases also enable researchers to distil design strategies in both manual and automated ways . For example , Jugulum and Frey [ 66 ] studied a large number of inventions and summarized general strategies employed in those inventions as a taxonomy of concept designs for improved robustness . Koh et al . [ 24 , 26 , 25 ] studied the proper ways and the repercussions of reviewing patent documents during the early design stage . Kokshagina et al . [ 27 ] proposed the ‘design - for - patentability’ strategy to guide the innovation of engineering designers . Several researchers have studied how to mine and analyse patent data to identify potential design opportunities and long - term strategic planning for innovation . For example , Luo and his team proposed a series of patent - data driven methods to enable high - level design opportunity identiﬁcation , strategic planning , analysis of the structure and expansion trajectories of domains , using the total technology space map based on the patent classiﬁcation system [ 58 , 23 , 67 ] . 4 Analysis of Methods and Algorithms The patent - for - design literature has employed a wide variety of research methods , ranging from qualitative analyses and reasoning to the latest network analysis and data science techniques . Fig . 4 visualizes the co - uses of methods and different parts of patent data in prior studies . One may adopt multiple methods on multiple data sources . We counted each item , ensuring that each method was matched to the corresponding part of patent data . Different line colours denote different parts of patent data , and the width of a line indicates the number of corresponding studies . Figure 4 : Methods in relation to different parts of patent data Human subject experiments were primarily employed to develop theory or understanding . In these human studies , full patent documents were often directly provided to designers as design aids such as prior art solutions [ 11 , 24 , 26 , 25 , 27 , 29 , 30 ] , or design stimuli [ 15 , 16 , 17 , 20 , 28 , 19 ] for engineering design . Besides , a group of qualitative studies adopted knowledge - based rules or strategies to boost computer - aided engineering design and developed rule - based expert systems [ 43 , 31 , 54 , 68 , 42 , 47 , 66 , 33 , 48 , 57 , 45 , 62 , 28 , 13 , 46 , 41 , 12 , 35 ] . These expert systems usually require designers to collaborate with algorithms to tackle speciﬁc problems . A wide range of data science techniques have been employed in the patent - for - design literature . For instance , complex network analysis has been adopted to mine relational information from citations or proximities of semantic content among patents [ 49 , 58 , 59 , 6 , 18 , 9 , 52 , 10 , 10 ] . Using network - based metrics , such as centrality , entropy , and coherence , 5 P ATENT D ATA FOR E NGINEERING D ESIGN : A R EVIEW prior studies have developed new scientiﬁc understanding of design artefacts and processes [ 22 , 67 ] and proposed patent data - driven design methodologies and strategies [ 6 ] . Some design tools , i . e . , InnoGPS and VISION , use network visualizations to guide designers in exploring the design or technology spaces , constructed on patent data or patent classiﬁcation labels . NLP techniques are growingly used to retrieve design knowledge from patent texts . A few studies adopted standard text pre - processing pipelines , including lemmatization , stemming and stop - words removal techniques to clean the raw text for the further processing steps . In addition , design knowledge is extracted in certain forms of templates from given patent text utilizing syntactic dependencies to support the automation of TRIZ [ 37 ] and construction of knowledge graphs [ 38 , 8 ] . Besides , topic modelling algorithms such as non - negative matrix factorization [ 10 , 9 ] and latent semantic analysis [ 69 , 49 , 17 ] have been applied on patent texts to represent design repositories in a more structured form . Semantic networks and knowledge graphs have been used to support engineering design research for a long time . Several early studies leveraged pre - trained common - sense semantic networks [ 48 ] or manually curated ontology - based knowledge graphs [ 43 , 68 , 47 ] to support design innovation and problem solving . Until recently , the patent database is mined to construct large - scale cross - domain engineering semantic networks and knowledge graphs [ 53 , 8 ] , serving as a knowledge infrastructure to support data - driven engineering design research and practice . Artiﬁcial neural networks and deep learning , because of their abilities to learn complex patterns from big data , have been employed in the patent - for - design literature . For instance , Li et al . [ 32 ] trained a neural network to classify patents by novelty levels of invention as deﬁned in TRIZ . Recently , researchers have developed design methodologies based on convolutional neural network ( CNN ) [ 4 ] and language models [ 53 ] trained on the dataset of patent images and patent texts , respectively . Other machine learning models such as Naïve Bayes [ 32 ] and advanced statistical analysis methods have also presented their values in the patent - for - design literature . It is worth mentioning that all parts of patent documents have the potential to support engineering design research with the use of diverse data science techniques , as seen in Fig . 4 . 5 Future opportunities and directions 5 . 1 Research opportunities regarding data Patent databases are natural benchmark datasets for supervised machine learning applications , because every patent is rigorously labelled by patent ofﬁces about its technological domain class ( es ) . The classiﬁcation information and citation - based metrics of patents can serve as the golden standard that enables the training , test and comparison of the performance of different algorithms . In addition , patent texts constitute a heavy load of design information which can be used for creating datasets for NLP - related tasks such as entity recognition and hierarchical analysis of inventions . However , these datasets would require heavy labelling and annotation , which are still human - intensive tasks requiring considerable expertise , time and resources . Besides , we can see that bibliometrics , images , citations and classiﬁcation information of patents are not commonly mined in Fig . 4 , compared to textual information . It is recommended that researchers leverage multimodal patent information instead of a single modality to develop more systemic understandings of design artefacts and processes or more powerful design methods and tools . 5 . 2 Research opportunities regarding algorithms Because of the large volume , patent databases are suitable for implementing modern deep learning techniques on speciﬁc tasks that usually require big data for the model training . The dramatic development of deep learning provides us many opportunities to combine up - to - date advances into engineering design research . First , recent progress on graph neural networks enables us to extract relational information among patents and derive high - dimensional representation for downstream tasks [ 70 ] , such as design repository reshaping and design stimuli identiﬁcation . Second , various of machine creation studies in the computer science ﬁeld , including text and image generation based on deep generative models or large pre - trained language models , can be utilized to develop idea generation methodologies . Researchers can develop generative models speciﬁcally for design synthesis by learning engineering knowledge from patents . Moreover , with the advancements in transformer - based language models , researchers can pre - train new models or ﬁne - tune pre - trained models on patent data to better represent the relations among semantic units in patents and identify the differences between common - sense knowledge and technology , engineering and design - related knowledge . In addition , given that patent documents normally contain multimodal information on design , we can take advantage of multimodal deep learning techniques to develop more intelligent design applications [ 71 ] , including multimodal knowledge graph construction , cross - modal idea generation , and cross - modal design retrieval . Such exploration of multimodal deep learning on patent data will have tremendous potential for engineering design applications . 6 P ATENT D ATA FOR E NGINEERING D ESIGN : A R EVIEW 5 . 3 Research opportunities regarding applications Fig . 3 shows that patent data are mostly used to develop design methods and tools , while applications in design science and strategy research at higher levels are limited . The large - scale patent databases that contain detailed multimodal content and rich bibliometrics , citation and classiﬁcation information offer unprecedented opportunities for design theory building . For example , big patent data analysis ( in contrast to small sample human subject studies ) may offer statistically signiﬁcant ﬁndings that explain the behaviours and interactions of design agents across diverse technological domains and the conditions for the emergence of the breakthrough design innovation . However , at present , only a few studies have adopted data - driven approaches to build theories in the design science ﬁeld . We believe such data - driven endeavours using patent data could substantially deepen and further our fundamental understanding of design team science , designer behaviours and rationales , design impact dynamics , and so on . 6 Conclusion Patent databases are ideal resources for engineering design researchers to develop design theories , strategies , methods , and tools based on manual efforts and various data science techniques because of the richness of design information contained in patent documents . The last decade has witnessed the growing trend of using data science techniques to mine and analyse the patent database to support engineering design research and applications . This paper contributes to the patent - for - design literature by elucidating the status quo of this ﬁeld and identifying potential research opportunities and directions . We hope our review and propositions can serve as a guide for design researchers and practitioners in discovering the greater value of patent databases for engineering design research , developing more powerful and intelligent patent data - driven design methods and tools , and advancing our scientiﬁc understanding and theories of design .
