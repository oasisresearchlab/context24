However , there has been limited research on COVID - 19 outcomes in exposed infants beyond the neonatal period . Between June 2020 – March 2021 , we conducted interviews and collected capillary dried blood spots from 46 SARS - CoV - 2 infected mothers and their infants ( aged 1 - 36 months ) for up to two months following maternal infection onset ( COVID + group , 87 % breastfeeding ) . Comparative data were also collected from 26 breastfeeding mothers with no known SARS - CoV - 2 infection or exposures ( breastfeeding control group ) , and 11 mothers who tested SARS - CoV - 2 negative after experiencing symptoms or close contact exposure ( COVID - group , 73 % breastfeeding ) . Dried blood spots were assayed for anti - SARS - CoV - 2 S - RBD IgG and IgA positivity and anti - SARS - CoV - 2 S1 + S2 IgG concentrations . Within the COVID + group , the mean probability of seropositivity among infant samples was lower than that of corresponding maternal samples ( 0 . 54 and 0 . 87 , respectively , for IgG ; 0 . 33 and 0 . 85 , respectively , for IgA ) , with likelihood of infant infection positively associated with the number of maternal symptoms and other household infections reported .

KEYWORDS COVID - 19 , pediatric , IgG , IgA , infancy , breastfeeding Introduction Most severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) infections in infants and children are asymptomatic or mild ( 1 – 3 ) , and children have shown persistently lower rates of severe coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) as compared to adults , even as the prevalence of pediatric cases increased over the course of pandemic ( 4 ) . Children may have lower susceptibility to severe infection due to age - related immune differences ( 5 ) , including pre - existing immunity from more frequent infection with other human coronaviruses ( 6 – 8 ) ; naïve immune responses that favor broad reactivity ( 9 ) ; lower rates of proin ﬂ ammatory cytokine imbalances and related comorbidities ( 10 ) ; and reduced viral entry in the lungs , perhaps owing to more limited angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) cell receptor expression or binding ( 10 , 11 ) . Understanding factors associated with COVID - 19 outcomes in infants and young children may help inform clinical therapies and policies regarding community transmission and mitigation strategies . However , research on infectious and immune outcomes within this age group has been limited , with the notable exception of research on fetal , perinatal , and neonatal transmission risks ( e . g . 12 – 14 ) . Beyond the neonatal period , infants may be at heighted risk of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission from infected caregivers due to the frequency and intensity of close contact care and feeding ( 15 , 16 ) , and may have higher risks of severe infection relative to older children due to less developed immune responses ( 6 , 17 , 18 ) . Outcomes of breastfed children exposed to SARS - CoV - 2 infected mothers are offurther interest , as milk is not a source of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission but is a source of persistent SARS - CoV - 2 speci ﬁ c antibodies ( 19 – 23 ) and likely other antiviral agents ( 24 , 25 ) . Therefore , additional research on antibody responses of infants and young children following maternal SARS - CoV - 2 infection is needed to further delineate risks in this age group , and may be informative for families who continue to navigate infant and young childcare and feeding decisions following household infections or exposures . We examined survey responses and antibody results assayed from capillary dried blood spots ( DBS ) , which were collected prospectively from 83 U . S . mother - infant dyads ( infants and young children aged 1 – 36 months , from here on referred to collectively as “ infants ” ) . Participants included SARS - CoV - 2 infected mothers and their infants , as well as comparison groups of uninfected mothers and their infants . Most infants were breastfeeding during the study period . We compared household testing outcomes , symptoms , and maternal and infant anti - SARS - CoV - 2 receptor binding domain ( RBD ) immunoglobulin ( Ig ) G and IgA responses across infected and uninfected groups and examined differences in trajectories of S1 and S2 - reactive IgG concentrations over time among participants who exhibited SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity . Among infected mothers and their infants , we tested for differences in probabilities of maternal and infant IgG and IgA seropositivity , and examined selected maternal , infant , and household factors associated with likelihood of infant PCR or antibody positivity . To our knowledge , this is the ﬁ rst study to prospectively examine SARS - CoV - 2 antibody responses in a sample of maternally exposed , mostly breastfed infants outside of the neonatal period . Materials and methods Study design and data collection These analyses use survey data and capillary dried blood collected as part of a prospective , multi - site , repeated - measures , observational study conducted with U . S . mother - infant dyads between June 2020 and March 2021 . The primary aims of the associated parent study were to ( 1 ) test for evidence of SARS - CoV - 2 virus and antibodies in milk produced by acutely infected Martin et al . 10 . 3389 / ﬁ mmu . 2022 . 1015002 Frontiers in Immunology frontiersin . org 02 BF mothers ( 22 , 23 ) , and ( 2 ) to examine viral , antibody , and symptomatic outcomes in these dyads over time , as well as in comparison with those of non - BF infected mothers and their exposed infants , and never - infected BF mothers and infants . Participants were recruited through outreach by participating institutions ( Tulane University ; University of Idaho ; University of Washington ; Washington State University ) and national social media advertising . Research personnel contacted prospective participants by phone to explain study procedures , determine eligibility , and obtain informed consent for all study procedures . Participating mothers had to be ≥ 18 years of age and the caregiver of a child ≤ 36 months of age . The present study used only data from dyads enrolled after 28 days postpartum ( antibody results of dyads enrolled < 28 days postpartum are described in the Supplementary Information ) . Additional eligibility requirements related to maternal COVID - 19 status and child feeding status varied by recruitment group ; no other demographic or health information were used as inclusion or exclusion criteria . Two primary study groups were recruited : ( 1 ) acutely infected breastfeeding and non - breastfeeding mothers who reported receiving a positive clinical polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) test result within the past 7 days ( COVID + , BF = 32 ; non - BF = 2 ) ; and ( 2 ) a control group of BF mothers who reported no known prior COVID - 19 infections or exposures ( BF control group , n = 26 ) . To augment sampling , the present study also made use of survey and capillary dried blood samples collected opportunistically from COVID + mothers who received a PCR - positive test result between 8 days and 2 months prior ( BF n = 8 , non - BF n = 4 ) , and from mothers who enrolled while awaiting testing due to symptoms or close contact exposure , but subsequently tested PCR negative ( COVID - , BF = 8 , non - BF = 3 ) . Surveys and samples collected from these latter groups were scheduled to best approximate the collection times of the parent COVID + group up through two months following maternal infection . Positive and negative PCR results reported by mothers were not con ﬁ rmed by additional in - house laboratory testing or follow - up . Data from all COVID + mothers ( regardless of time since positive PCR test and BF status ) were combined ( n dyads = 46 ) and compared with results from the COVID - and BF control groups . Recruitment groups and participant characteristics across the three study groups are described in Figure S1 and Table 1 . Mothers answered survey questions by phone and collected capillary DBS from themselves and their infants over two months according to their enrollment group ( Table 2 ) Surveys included questions about COVID - 19 exposures , testing , and symptoms of all household members ( see Supplemental Information for speci ﬁ c survey questions ) . Mothers were provided self - collection kits and instructions for ﬁ nger and heel - prick capillary DBS for themselves and their infants using disposable safety lancets and HemaSpot ™ - HF ﬁ lter paper devices ( see Supplemental Information for instructions provided to participants ) . In families offour COVID + and four COVID - mothers , other consenting household adults ( n = 8 ) and children ages 2 - 5 years old ( n = 4 ) provided HemaSpot DBS for antibody testing along with maternal and infant samples . Table 3 summarizes DBS samples provided per enrollment group , participant category , and per collection time . Missing DBS data relative to survey data re ﬂ ect preferences to opt - out of this procedure and dif ﬁ culties collecting samples . All families in the COVID + and COVID - groups were recruited between June and November 2020 before vaccines were widely available ; dyads in the BF control group were recruited between November 2020 and January 2021 . One COVID + mother and nine mothers in the control group received at least one dose of a COVID - 19 vaccine after beginning study participation . All data collection was completed by March 2021 , before the SARS - CoV - 2 delta and omicron variants were widely transmitted within the U . S . Laboratory analysis Blood spot samples deemed to have suf ﬁ cient sample quantity and quality ( n = 363 / 380 collected ) were analyzed for IgG and IgA antibodies targeting the SARS - CoV - 2 RBD . Samples were analyzed using published enzyme immunoassay method for IgG ( 26 ) , additionally modi ﬁ ed to detect IgA , and validated for use with HemaSpot - HF DBS samples ( see Supplementary Information for a detailed description of assay validation and protocols ) . Sample seropositivity for anti - S RBD IgG and IgA was determined relative to negative controls ( ACCURUN Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 Reference Material Kit , Series 2000 , SeraCare ) , which were run in quadruplicate on all plates . Negative cutoff values for each plate were de ﬁ ned as the mean plus 3 standard deviations of the optical density for all four negative control wells . A signal to cutoff ratio ( S / CO ) was calculated for each sample by dividing the sample ’ s optical density by the cutoff value determined for each assay plate , and used to designate seropositivity : S / CO > 1 = positive , and S / CO < 1 = negative . The mean intraassay coef ﬁ cients of variation ( CV ) for IgG and IgA were 8 . 5 % and 12 . 6 % , respectively ; mean interassay CVs for low and high controls were : 5 . 4 % and 11 . 5 % ( IgG ) , respectively , and 12 . 3 % and 12 . 9 % ( IgA ) , respectively . IgG positive samples with suf ﬁ cient remaining volume ( n = 125 ) were tested again using a quantitative multiplex assay for measurement of IgG antibodies to both the SARS - CoV - 2 S1 and S2 subunits ( Quansys Biosciences ) . Lower and upper limits of detection for S1 and S2 assays were 97 . 5 – 75 , 000 U / mL . Cutoff values for the quantitative IgG assay were determined according to the kit protocol , and all sample results quantitatively assayed were positive after adjusting for the dilution factor . Mean intraassay CVs for S1 and S2 were 8 . 4 % and 6 . 3 % , respectively .

Statistical analysis For all enrollment groups and household member categories , we calculated prevalence of PCR testing , PCR positivity , COVID - 19 symptoms in the two weeks following maternal start date ( maternally reported for infants and other household members ) , and seropositivity ( de ﬁ ned as at least one positive IgG or IgA antibody test result in any DBS collected ) . For the COVID + and COVID - groups , maternal infection onset was de ﬁ ned as the date of onset of maternal COVID - like symptoms , or maternal PCR test date if asymptomatic . For the control group , maternal start date was the date of study enrollment . To examine group differences in IgG and IgA seropositivity over time , we plotted individual and mean IgG and IgA S / CO ratios for mothers and infants in each group and plotted mean IgG and IgA S / CO ratios from samples taken pre - and post - maternal vaccination in a subsample of the control group . Differences in maternal and infant antibody responses were further examined among the COVID + group only via a series of Bayesian models . All models were run in R v . 4 . 1 . 1 using the ‘ brms ’ package to ﬁ t linear and generalized linear models with full Bayesian inference in Stan ( 27 – 29 ) . Models ran for 3000 iterations with 4 chains each , using the package ’ s default improper ﬂ at prior for population - level coef ﬁ cients ( 29 ) . Mean probabilities of IgG and IgA seropositivity ( S / CO > 1 ) for maternal and infant samples were estimated with generalized linear models ( Bernoulli distribution and logit parameterization ) , and reran with S / CO > 2 as the threshold for positivity as a measure of robustness . Infant PCR and IgG / IgA results were combined to examine the likelihood of any PCR / antibody positive test in association with infant age , total number of maternal symptoms reported following infection onset , and total number of other household members reporting positive PCR tests . We then estimated differences in seropositivity probability among maternal and infant samples over time by ﬁ tting a non - linear model with a cubic - spline and interaction terms between participant category ( mother vs . infant ) and time since maternal infection onset ( in days ) . Splines were ﬁ t with knot points at 14 , 28 , and 60 days for all IgG models and 14 , 21 , and 60 days for IgA models , given that RBD IgA concentrations appear to peak approximately 3 weeks after infection onset whereas IgG levels increase through week 4 ( 30 ) . To examine quantitative differences in circulating antibody responses over time , we ﬁ t the same non - linear Bayesian models ( with interaction terms for participant category and sample time ) to IgG S1 and S2 concentrations . Correlations between S1 and S2 subunit concentrations were examined using the ‘ rmcorr ’ package for repeated measures correlations ( 31 ) . All Bayesian model estimates have effective sample sizes greater than 1 , 000 , and Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) chains across all models showed suf ﬁ cient convergence ( all Rhat = 1 . 00 ) . Results Symptoms and household testing Participants in our study experienced relatively mild COVID - 19 , with no mothers or infants hospitalized for this disease . In the ﬁ rst two weeks following maternal start date , 87 % of COVID + mothers reported experiencing at least one systematically surveyed COVID - 19 symptom ( Table 4 ) . COVID + mothers most commonly reported fatigue ( 65 % ) , loss of smell or taste ( 59 % ) , congestion or runny nose ( 57 % ) , headache ( 54 % ) , and cough ( 44 % ) ( Table 4 ) . In contrast , all COVID - mothers but only 20 % of mothers in the BF control group reported any COVID - 19 - like symptoms during the ﬁ rst two weeks of suspected infection or enrollment . Similar proportions of infants displaying any COVID - 19 - like signs were reported for the COVID + group ( 50 % ) , COVID - group TABLE 3 Count summary of dried bloods spots ( DBS ) analyzed per enrollment group , participant category , and time since maternal start date ( ﬁ rst day of reported maternal symptoms or PCR test for COVID + / - groups , and days since enrollment date for BF control group ) .

Infant COVID - 19 - like signs were also more diverse , with only congestion / runny nose reported for more than 20 % of infants in the COVID + group ( Table 4 ) . Among households of COVID + mothers , the proportion of infants demonstrating any symptoms in the two weeks following maternal infection onset was lower than that reported for other adults and children aged 5 - 9 years , but double the rate reported for other children under 5 years of age years ( Table 5 ) . Rates of PCR testing were lower in infants compared to other child age groups , and positivity rates across all children tested were lower than those of other household adults ( Table 5 ) . Due to the nonuniform testing within families , it was not possible to determine index cases or estimate average household secondary attack rates . Rates of PCR testing across age groups were similar among households of COVID + and COVID - mothers . Differences in antibody responses among COVID + , COVID - , and control groups Nearly all ( 96 % ) blood spot samples collected in this study ( 363 / 380 ) yielded suf ﬁ cient blood for in - house IgG and IgA testing ( maternal samples : n = 195 ; infant samples : n = 128 ; opportunistically collected samples from other household children and adults : n = 40 . The majority of COVID + mothers ( 36 / 46 ) provided at least one DBS sample with suf ﬁ cient blood for antibody testing ( median samples / subject = 4 ) , with 89 % ( 32 / 36 ) of these mothers testing positive for IgG or IgA at least once ( Table 5 ) . In contrast , DBS samples were collected from just 25 / 46 of their exposed infants ( median samples / subject = 2 ) , with 48 % ( 12 / 25 ) testing positive for IgG or IgA ( Table 5 ) . Combined PCR and antibody test results were available for only 11 infants in the COVID + group : 7 / 11 had concordant results ( three PCR + / antibody + and four PCR - / antibody - ) and 4 / 11 had discordant results ( three PCR - / antibody + , one PCR + / antibody - ) . Individual and mean signal - to - cutoff ( S / CO ) trajectories plotted for COVID + dyads demonstrate generally weaker signal and greater number of infant samples falling below the S / CO > 1 positivity threshold as compared to maternal samples ( Figures 1 , 2 ) . No samples collected from COVID - mothers ( n subjects = 6 / 11 , n samples = 18 ) or their infants ( n subjects = 7 / 11 , n samples = 18 ) tested IgG or IgA positive ( Table 5 , Figures 1 , 2 ) . This included four samples collected from one infant reported to test PCR + , and all maternal and infant samples ( n = 25 samples ) collected from four families in which samples provided concurrently by fathers tested antibody positive ( data not shown ) . Among dyads in the BF control group , DBS samples were returned by 23 / 26 mothers and 18 / 26 of infants , with 6 / 23 mothers receiving at least one COVID - 19 vaccination following enrollment . Unexpectedly , 47 % ( 8 / 17 ) of the non - vaccinated control group mothers returned at least one sample that tested IgG or IgA positive ( 18 / 46 samples total , Figure 1 ) . Six of these mothers returned positive samples at the ﬁ rst DBS collection seven days after enrollment ( Table 2 ) , while two mothers who initially tested negative returned positive samples beginning at TABLE 4 Systematically surveyed COVID - 19 symptoms / signs reported by mothers and for their infants during the ﬁ rst two weeks following maternal infection onset or enrollment date ( for COVID + / - and BF control groups , respectively ) ; N / A = not asked of that group ; ( - ) = none reporting .

As demonstrated by individual and mean S / CO trajectories , IgG and IgA antibody responses of these mothers were generally weaker as compared to those of COVID + mothers , and none of their corresponding infant samples tested IgG or IgA positive ( Figures 1 , 2 ) .

The plotted mean IgG and IgA S / CO trajectories for maternal samples in this group peak at 4 - 6 weeks post - vaccination , with a similarly weaker IgA signal as observed in COVID + mothers FIGURE 1 Individual maternal IgG and IgA S / CO trajectories ( dashed , colored lines ) over two months following maternal infection onset or enrollment , and loess smooth curves ( solid , colored lines ) ﬁ t for each enrollment group : COVID + ( n = 36 , n obs = 116 ) ; COVID - ( n = 6 , n obs = 18 ) ; BF control group , ( n = 20 , n obs = 50 , excluding samples collected post - vaccination ) .

Maternal samples that did not test IgG positive were collected between 30 days prior to and 5 days after the ﬁ rst vaccine dose ( Figure S2 ) . The plotted mean S / CO trajectories from corresponding infant samples do not cross the positivity threshold for IgG or IgA ( Figure S2 ) , although one infant in this group tested antibody positive in samples taken 6 and 62 days after the mother ’ s ﬁ rst vaccine dose . Antibody responses of COVID + mothers and exposed infants Mean probabilities of IgG and IgA seropositivity ( S / CO > 1 ) were lower for infants than mothers in the COVID + group . However , infant estimates also show greater uncertainty and a higher mean probability of IgG compared to IgA seropositivity ( Figure 3 ) . For both maternal and infant samples , estimated mean probabilities of IgG and IgA seropositivity increased between approximately 15 - 20 days after maternal infection onset and thereafter remained elevated , but with greater uncertainty ( Figure 4 ) . Mean probability of IgA seropositivity showed a similar pattern for maternal samples but decreased in infant samples approximately 30 days after maternal infection onset ( Figure 4 ) . Applying a higher threshold of seropositivity ( S / CO > 2 ) did not substantially alter mean probability estimates for infant or maternal IgG ( infant est . w / 95 % CI : 0 . 49 [ 0 . 29 – 0 . 69 ] ; maternal : 0 . 84 [ 0 . 71 – 0 . 93 ] ) but resulted in lower probability estimates for IgA ( infant : 0 . 22 [ 0 . 11 – 0 . 38 ] ; maternal : 0 . 61 [ 0 . 44 – 0 . 75 ] , Figure S3 ) . Due to limited antibody and PCR testing in infants of COVID + mothers , we also examined factors associated with infant positivity de ﬁ ned as ever testing positive by PCR or IgG / IgA testing . In univariate models , infant positivity was associated with total maternal symptoms reported at infection onset and with the total number of other household members testing positive , but was not associated with infant age , presence / absence of maternal cough , total number of other household members reporting COVID - 19 symptoms , or the ratio of total household members testing positive to total tested ( Table 6 ) . In a multivariate model including both total maternal symptoms and other household members infected , effect estimates of both variables were mediated by adjusting for the other ( Table 6 ) . Model ﬁ t and performance , as indicated by leave - one - out - cross - validation information criterion and Pareto k estimates , were also poorer than those of respective univariate models . Among the COVID + mothers and infants who tested IgG positive , and adjusting for time since maternal infection onset , we observed a trend of higher estimated mean subunit S1 - reactive IgG concentrations in infants as compared to mothers ( S1 infant est . w / 95 % CI = 20616 [ 14176 – 27059 ] U / mL ; maternal est . = 10508 [ 5398 – 15888 ] U / mL ) . S2 concentrations were in infant samples ( S2 infant est . = 13376 [ 3253 – 23127 ] U / mL ; maternal est . = 27157 [ 19244 – 35042 ] U / mL ) but overlapped substantially with credible intervals of maternal samples , and in some cases spanned biologically implausible negative values ( Figure 5 ) . The pattern of higher IgG S1 and lower IgG S2 in pediatrics vs . adult samples persisted when combining maternal and infant samples with all positive IgG samples collected opportunistically from other household adults and children , though again credible intervals were large and overlapping ( Figure S4 ) . In repeated measures correlations , IgG S1 and S2 concentrations were moderately correlated in maternal samples ( r = 0 . 43 [ 0 . 11 – 0 . 75 ] , df = 48 , p = 0 . 002 ) , but could not be accurately estimated for infant samples due to the limited sample size . In Bayesian linear model estimates adjusting for day of sample collection , the total number of maternal COVID - 19 symptoms reported at infection onset was positively associated with IgG S2 ( 1968 [ 189 – 3727 ] U / mL ) , but not IgG S1 FIGURE 2 Individual infant IgG and IgA S / CO trajectories ( dashed , colored lines ) with group - level loess smoothes ( solid , colored lines ) over two months following maternal infection onset or enrollment , by maternal study group : COVID + ( n = 25 , n obs = 66 ) ; COVID - ( n = 7 , n obs = 18 ) ; and BF control group , excluding samples collected post - maternal vaccination ( n = 15 , n obs = 35 ) , S / CO = 1 . 0 ( solid black line ) , S / CO = 2 . 0 ( dashed black line ) .

The presence or absence of COVID - 19 symptoms in infants during the ﬁ rst two weeks following maternal infection onset was not associated with infant IgG S1 or S2 concentrations , with wide credible intervals spanning biologically implausible values ( S1 : 22775 [ - 14096 – 60562 ] U / mL ; S2 : 14579 [ - 9088 – 38029 ] U / mL ) . Discussion In this study of SARS - CoV - 2 infected mothers and their infants ( nearly 90 % of whom were breastfeeding ) , infants were considerably less likely than mothers to exhibit IgG and IgA seropositivity . In other studies of adults and children , SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity is strongly associated with concurrent household infection ( 15 , 32 ) , and symptom severity is associated with higher viral load ( 33 ) and higher household secondary attack rates ( 34 , 35 ) . Similarly , in our study , probability of infant positivity ( as determined by PCR or antibody testing ) was associated with the total number of other household members testing positive and the total number of maternal symptoms reported following maternal infection onset . Mean probabilities of IgG and IgA seropositivity remained relatively constant in mothers in the two months following maternal infection onset , but declined for infants , particularly for IgA . However , uncertainty among infant estimates was markedly greater and increased over time , likely a result of more limited sampling , mild symptoms , and faster rate of decline in antibody responses . Previous studies have observed that SARS - CoV - 2 RBD - IgG and IgA levels in adults begin to rise during the ﬁ rst days of infection , peak at 15 - 28 days post - symptom onset , and then remain detectable for at least 6 months post - infection ( 36 – 39 ) . In children and adults , asymptomatic and mild COVID - 19 is associated with lower antibody levels and earlier declines in antibody levels ( 5 , 40 – 42 ) . Children have been observed to exhibit greater SARS - CoV - 2 cross - reactivity in humoral responses , with robust spike - speci ﬁ c antibody responses lasting at least 12 months , but weaker and more quickly waning responses to nucleocapsid ( 7 ) and reduced neutralizing activity ( 42 ) . In general , however , adults and children appear to have similar viral , cellular , and serological responses in cases of asymptomatic or mild COVID - 19 , with immune responses only diverging with severe disease ( 5 ) . Lower probability estimates of IgA relative to IgG seropositivity in our study may re ﬂ ect lower assay sensitivity in combination with earlier peaks and declines in IgA ( 30 ) , particularly among infants who had milder symptoms .

This pattern persisted when examining all available positive samples from children and adults . In previous studies conducted with uninfected , pre - pandemic blood donors , SARS - CoV - 2 S2 - reactive IgG antibodies have been observed at higher prevalence in children as compared to adults ( 8 ) , but with no S2 cross - reactivity observed in infants less than 1 year old , and little cross - reactivity in S1 across ages ( 43 ) . The S2 domain of the spike protein is more conserved and more likely to elicit coronavirus cross - reactivity compared to S1 ( 44 ) . Higher pre - existing SARS - CoV - 2 S2 - reactive antibody concentrations in children have been suggested to result from their more frequent human coronavirus exposures , which could confer enhanced cross - reactive immunological memory and therefore greater protection against severe infection ( 7 , 8 ) . The marked uncertainty and lower mean S2 - reactive IgG concentration among positive infant samples in this study may re ﬂ ect age - related differences in immune development , as well as a relative lack of recent human coronavirus exposures due to pandemic - related changes in social interactions during the time of data collection ( June 2020 to March 2021 ) . Within households of the COVID + group , rates of PCR - positivity and symptoms were lower among infants and other household children as compared to mothers and other household adults . These results concur with ﬁ ndings from global studies conducted during the ﬁ rst year of the pandemic , in which infection rates were lowest among infants and young children in communities ( 32 , 45 ) and households ( 46 – 48 ) , with household secondary attack rates ranging from 5 % to 55 % and exhibiting marked variation across age groups ( 34 , 49 – 52 ) . In an observational study of SARS - CoV - 2 infected children , infants < 2 years of age were observed to have lower viral loads but lower prevalence of symptomatic cases as compared to children 2 years and older ( 53 ) . We observed a slightly higher prevalence of PCR positivity and symptomatic cases among infants as compared to other household children aged 2 - 5 years in our study , though differences in PCR positivity may re ﬂ ect age - related differences in exposures related to care and feeding , testing , and parental perception of symptoms and risks that in ﬂ uenced testing . PCR positivity rates across all infants and children in our study may be underestimated due to limited testing at the time of data collection , as later seroprevalence studies demonstrated much higher rates of infection in children that were often asymptomatic ( 15 ) . Interestingly , while no COVID - mothers or their infants tested antibody positive , nearly half of non - vaccinated mothers in the BF control group tested antibody positive despite no known prior COVID - 19 infection or exposures . These samples were collected from November 2020 to March 2021 , by which time community transmission had increased in many areas . Thus , these mothers may have been unknowingly asymptomatically infected prior to or shortly after enrolling . No concurrently collected infant samples tested antibody positive , however , suggesting that these infants were either not infected following maternal exposure , or experienced very mild infections with quickly waning antibody responses . Our study is limited by the small sample size and relatively few infants with concurrent PCR test and antibody test results available for comparison . PCR test results were maternally reported and not con ﬁ rmed by additional follow - up or in - house laboratory testing , which may increase error in our results due to possibility of false positive and negative test results among participants . Many of the participants in our study were still adhering to community physical distancing mandates or recommendations at the time of data collection . We also relied on participant - collected DBS from ﬁ nger - and heel - prick capillary samples as part of no - contact data collection protocols developed to ensure participant and researcher safety . Antibody titers obtained from capillary and venipuncture samples are equivalent ( 54 ) , and community seroprevalence testing of SARS - CoV - 2 using self - collected DBS samples has been previously validated ( 55 ) . To further ease participant burden , our home - collection DBS kits included HemaSpot devices , which require less blood and are more easily handled than standard ﬁ lter paper cards . Hemaspot DBS with suf ﬁ cient sample remaining for qualitative antibody testing were collected from 78 % and 54 % of COVID + mothers and their infants , respectively , and from 88 % and 73 % of mothers and infants , respectively , in the BF control group , suggesting that capillary blood spot collection was more challenging for infants and particularly within families experiencing acute infections . Despite these limitations , our study provides additional support for the feasibility of DBS self - collection to expand SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence testing with targeted study groups . To date , the majority of studies on paired maternal - infant COVID - 19 outcomes have examined evidence related to vertical transmission in utero , during delivery , or through breast milk . Such studies have been critical in establishing low risks of vertical transmission in comparison with other exposures , and have bolstered recommendations for continued maternal - infant contact , rooming - in and breastfeeding ( 56 – 60 ) . Research has also conclusively established that milk of SARS - CoV - 2 infected and vaccinated mothers is a source of long - lasting antibodies with neutralizing activity against SARS - CoV - 2 ( 21 – 23 , 61 , 62 ) . However , limited research has examined maternal - infant infectious outcomes in later infancy , or in relation to speci ﬁ c caregiver exposures or behaviors that in ﬂ uence infant infection risks . To our knowledge , this is the ﬁ rst study to prospectively examine SARS - CoV - 2 antibody responses in infants ( most of whom were breastfeeding ) following maternal infection outside of the neonatal period ( > 28 days ) . Limited survey research has demonstrated a similarly low rate ( 32 % ) of reported PCR positivity in breastfed infants of COVID - 19 positive mothers ( 60 ) . Elsewhere , non - infected breastfed infants were observed to exhibit Martin et al . 10 . 3389 / ﬁ mmu . 2022 . 1015002 Frontiers in Immunology frontiersin . org 11 elevated SARS - CoV - 2 speci ﬁ c salivary IgA two months after maternal COVID - 19 infection , without concurrent elevation of serum antibodies , suggesting direct stimulation of infant salivary antibodies from antigen - antibody immune complexes in milk ( 63 ) . Still , it remains unclear how the timing of maternal infection or vaccination , total household infectious burden , and the frequency and type of milk feeding may further mitigate infant outcomes of infected lactating mothers . While we were unable to evaluate any direct protective effect of breastfeeding on infant outcomes in our study , exposed breastfed infants did not appear to be at higher risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection as compared to other ( non - breastfed ) household children and adults . Our ﬁ ndings further support previous research demonstrating minimal risks to infants following maternal COVID - 19 infection , including for breastfeeding infants .
