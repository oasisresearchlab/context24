Here , we generated and characterized mice with conditional ablation of atg5 in GABAergic neurons expressing parvalbumin ( PV - atg5KO ) , mostly comprising fast - spiking interneurons , as well as Purkinje cells in the cerebellum . Using light - sheet microscopy to image PV neurons throughout the brain , we reveal that autophagy is required for the sustenance of Purkinje cells but not of PV - interneurons . Yet , proteomic analysis showed that autophagy deficiency in cortical and hippocampal PV - interneurons alters the proteostasis of key synaptic proteins , as well as the surface expression of glutamate receptor subunits . Consistently , hippocampal autophagy - deficient PV - interneurons exhibit reduced inhibitory neurotransmission and PV - atg5KO mice display excitation - inhibition imbalance in the hippocampus and memory deficits . Our findings demonstrate a neuronal type - specific vulnerability to autophagy deficiency , while also identifying PV - interneurons as cellular substrates where autophagy is required for memory . Keywords : autophagy , memory , inhibitory neurotransmission , parvalbumin , interneurons , Purkinje cells , neuronal death Chalatsi et al . , 3 Introduction In humans , genetic mutations resulting in diminished autophagic activity manifest as complex neurodevelopmental disorders , entailing epilepsy and impaired cognitive performance ( Ebrahimi - Fakhari et al . , 2016 ) , or late - onset neurodegenerative diseases ( Nixon , 2013 ) . However , the roles of autophagy in the sustenance and synaptic transmission of diverse neurons remain insufficiently characterized . In mammals , the developmental ablation of core autophagy genes , such as atg5 ( Hara et al . , 2006 ; Kuijpers et al . , 2021 ) , a tg7 ( Komatsu et al . , 2006 ) or wdr45 ( Zhao et al . , 2015 ) , leads to progressive and widespread neuronal death . In these studies , autophagy genes were ablated in multiple cell types of the brain , including progenitors and their derived neurons , astrocytes and oligodendrocytes , making it difficult to ascertain whether different types of post - mitotic neurons require autophagy in a cell - autonomous manner for their survival or sustenance . Beyond neuronal survival , accumulating evidence suggests that autophagy also regulates several aspects of the physiology of glutamatergic neurons . These include the development and maturation of excitatory synapses , by facilitating the pruning of their dendritic spines ( Tang et al . , 2014 ) , long - term synaptic depression ( LTD ) , through the degradation of post - synaptic proteins ( Compans et al . , 2021 ; Kallergi et al . , 2022 ; Pan et al . , 2021 ) and basal excitatory neurotransmission , by regulating presynaptic ER - homeostasis and calcium stores ( Kuijpers et al . , 2021 ) . In agreement with its emergent synaptic functions , autophagy was also found to be essential in the hippocampus for memory and learning ( Glatigny et al . , 2019 ; Pandey et al . , 2021 ) . Yet the cellular substrates where autophagy is required for these complex behaviors remain elusive . This is largely due to lack of knowledge on whether autophagy also regulates the sustenance and synaptic properties of other neuronal populations , such as interneurons , which provide inhibition into the neuronal networks they are embedded in . We hypothesized that the memory deficits associated with impaired brain autophagy may involve the dysfunction of Parvalbumin ( PV ) - expressing neurons . In the cortex and hippocampus , PV is mostly expressed by fast - spiking interneurons ( Hippenmeyer et al . , 2005 ) . Despite comprising a small fraction of the brain ' s neuronal network , these cells are characterized by unique morphological and molecular properties that make them key players of excitation - inhibition balance and GABAergic disinhibition between circuitries ( Nahar et al . , 2021 ) . As well as being heavily implicated in neuro - psychiatric diseases ( Kaar et al . , 2019 ; Nakazawa et al . , 2012 ; Ruden et al . , 2021 ) , PV - expressing neurons have high metabolic demands ( Gotti et al . , 2021 ; Inan et al . , Chalatsi et al . , 4 2016 ; Kontou et al . , 2021 ) , rendering them potentially vulnerable to different types of stress ( Page et al . , 2019 ) including autophagy impairment . To address this hypothesis , we generated and characterized mice with conditional ablation of a tg5 in PV - expressing neurons . We demonstrate that Purkinje cells are selectively eliminated in the absence of functional autophagy , while the survival and sustenance of PV - interneurons are unaffected . Moreover , we reveal a pivotal role of autophagy in regulating the proteostasis and inhibitory neurotransmission of PV - interneurons , whose impairment has direct repercussions on the hippocampal network and on memory . Results To determine the functional repertoire of autophagy in PV - expressing neurons , we crossed the pv - cre deleter mice ( Hippenmeyer et al . , 2007 ) with mice carrying floxed alleles of atg5 ( Hara et al . , 2006 ) . The resulting pv - cre ; atg5 f / f progeny ( referred to hereafter as PV - atg5KO ) was generated at the expected mendelian ratios . Upon reaching adulthood ( three - month - old ) , PV - atg5KOs presented a significant reduction in body weight when compared to their atg5 f / f littermates ( referred to here as control ) ( Figure S1A , B ) . The two genotypes consumed similar amount of food , suggesting that differences in weight cannot be ascribed to altered feeding behavior in PV - atg5KOs ( Figure S1C ) . After crossing the pv - cre and PV - atg5KO animals to the robust Ai9 cre - dependent Td - Tomato ( TdT ) reporter strain ( Madisen et al . , 2010 ) , we confirmed that a very high percentage of TdT - positive cells could be co - labelled using antibodies against PV in multiple brain areas ( Figure S1D ) , as illustrated by representative images from the hippocampus and the somatosensory cortex ( Figure S1E ) . Next , we FACS - sorted TdT - positive cells from pv - cre ; TdT tg / + ( control ) and pv - cre ; atg5 f / f ; TdT tg / + ( PV - atg5KO - TdT ) adult brains and performed JESS - Western blot analysis using antibodies against the autophagic substrate p62 ( also known as Sqstm1 ) . As shown in Figure S1F , p62 protein levels were significantly increased in neuronal lysates prepared from PV - atg5KO - TdT mice , when compared to the control , indicating a successful impairment of autophagic degradation within these cells . In line with this , we prepared protein lysates from the cerebellar cortex of adult ( three - month - old ) control and PV - atg5KO mice , a brain area containing a much higher proportion of PV - expressing cells . Western blot analyses indicated a significant accumulation of p62 ( Figure S1G ) , as well as of another autophagy receptor , Alfy ( also known as Wdfy3 ) ( Figure S1H ) in PV - atg5KO cerebellar lysates , both of which are known to accumulate when autophagic degradation is impaired . Moreover , analysis with an antibody against Atg5 , Chalatsi et al . , 5 recognizing the Atg5 - Atg12 complex at 60KD , further confirmed a significant reduction of the Atg5 protein in PV - atg5KO when compared to control ( Figure S1I ) . In the cerebellum , PV is expressed by two distinct GABAergic populations : 1 ) the Purkinje cells , inhibitory projection neurons that co - express calbindin and are located in the Purkinje cell layer , and 2 ) the PV - interneurons found in the molecular layer . A previous study reported that autophagy is required for the maintenance of Purkinje cells , whereby the conditional ablation of atg7 using a pcp2 - cre deleter mouse led to their rapid degeneration ( Komatsu et al . , 2007 ) . In line with these findings , immunolabeling cerebellar cryosections with antibodies against PV and Calbindin confirmed the drastic loss of more than half of the Purkinje cells in six - month - old PV - atg5KO brains ( Figure 1A , B ) . Moreover , at three - months - of - age , the vast majority of Purkinje cells were immuno - reactive for active caspase - 3 ( Figure S1J , K ) , suggesting that the loss of these neurons is progressive . Consistent with the degeneration of Purkinje cells , three - month - old PV - atg5KO mice exhibited impaired motor coordination in a rotarod test , demonstrating a significant reduction in their mean latency to fall from the rotarod ( Figure S1L ) and across three consecutive trials ( Figure S1M ) when compared to control littermates . These data provide further support to the hypothesis that autophagy is required in Purkinje cells for their sustenance and for the expression of cerebellar - dependent behaviors . In contrast , the number of PV - immunoreactive ( and Calbindin - negative ) interneurons in the cerebellar molecular cell layer was comparable between six - month - old control and PV - atg5KO mice ( Figure 1C ) . Similarly , we did not observe any immunoreactivity for active caspase - 3 in the cerebellar molecular cell layer of PV - atg5KO ( Figure S1J , arrowheads , and S1N ) . Together , these observations invite the speculation that distinct PV - expressing cell populations exhibit differential vulnerability to autophagy perturbation . In order to assess the requirement of autophagy for PV - neuron maintenance across the brain in an unbiased manner , we then used CLARITY combined with light sheet imaging and machine learning ( outlined in Figure 1D ) to compare the number of PV - positive neurons between three - month - old pv - cre ; TdT tg / + ( control ) and pv - cre ; atg5 f / f ; TdT tg / + ( PV - atg5KO - TdT ) mice . In line with Figure 1A - B , we found a significant reduction in the number of TdT - positive Purkinje cells in the PV - atg5KO - TdT brains when compared to controls ( Figure 1E ) , confirming the fidelity of this approach in assessing changes in the number of PV - neurons . Interestingly however , further analysis of eight major brain regions known to contain PV - interneurons indicated no significant differences in the number of TdT - positive cells in PV - atg5KO when compared to age - matched controls ( Figures 1F - M ; expressed as percentage of control in panels 1E - M and as total cell counts in Suppl . Table 1 ) . Furthermore , no significant differences were observed in the volume Chalatsi et al . , 6 of these brain structures between the two genotypes ( Suppl . Table 1 ) , and a TUNEL assay of three - and six - month - old brain sections confirmed the absence of apoptosis in the PV - atg5KO across the forebrain ( Suppl . Table 4 ) . Taken together , these results demonstrate that autophagy is not required for the survival of PV - interneurons across the brain . Given the fundamental role of autophagy in protein turnover , we then speculated that despite not compromising the maintenance of PV interneurons , impaired autophagy may cause deficits in their proteostasis that could directly or indirectly impact their function . To test this hypothesis , we FACS - sorted TdT - positive parvalbumin interneurons from the isocortex and hippocampus of three - month old control ( pv - cre ; TdT tg / + ) and PV - atg5KO - TdT ( pv - cre ; atg5 f / f ; TdT tg / + ) mice and analyzed them by quantitative proteomics . Principal component analysis indicated a clear segregation of the four control and four knockout replicates based on genotype ( Figure S2A ) . Mass - spectrometry analysis identified a total of 5963 proteins that were detected by at least two unique peptides ( Suppl . Table S2 ) . As analysis was performed after FACS - sorting , which can result in breakage of synapses , we first wanted to ensure that synaptic proteins were adequately identified . To this end , we compared our list of identified proteins with the SynGO database and found 824 synaptic proteins present in our list , representing 13 . 82 % of the total proteins detected in our analysis ( Figure 2A ) . The detected synaptic proteins comprised 66 . 77 % of the entire synaptic proteome ( Figure S2B ) , however , did not include any neurotransmitter receptors , presumably due to the limitations posed by FACS - sorting . We also identified 438 mitochondrial proteins , representing 7 . 35 % of the total proteins detected in our analysis ( Figure 2A ) , and 38 . 42 % of the MitoCarta 3 . 0 mitochondrial protein database ( Rath et al . , 2021 ) ( Figure S2C ) . Finally , we detected 392 ER and 534 Golgi proteins , representing 6 . 6 % and 8 . 96 % of the total identified proteins ( Figure 2A ) , respectively , and comprising 74 . 95 % ( Figure S2D ) and 47 . 38 % of the ER and Golgi proteomes ( Figure S2E ) , respectively ( Thul et al . , 2017 ) . In order to characterize the effects of autophagy ablation on the PV interneuron proteome , we set a p - value of 0 . 02 ( - log10 ( 0 . 02 ) = 1 . 7 ) as the cutoff for determining the proteins that are differentially abundant between control and PV - atg5KO - TdT samples . This was based on the enrichment of the positive control p62 ( Sqstm1 ) in the PV - atg5KO - TdT sample ( Figure 2B ) . As expected , Atg5 was significantly decreased and Alfy ( Wdfy3 ) , another selective aggrephagy receptor , was significantly increased in the PV - atg5KO - TdT sample , as expected ( Figure 2B ) . Furthermore , we found 281 proteins that were differentially expressed between the two genotypes , 162 of which were enriched and 119 were less abundant in the PV - atg5KO - TdT sample , when compared to the control ( Figure 2C ) . Both the significantly enriched and less abundant proteins included synaptic , mitochondrial , ER and Golgi proteins ( as summarized in Chalatsi et al . , 7 Figure 2D ) . Notably , while all the ER proteins found to be dysregulated in autophagy - deficient excitatory neurons ( Kuijpers et al . , 2021 ) were detected in our mass - spectrometry analysis ( Figure S2F ) , no significant differences in expression were found between genotypes ( Figure S2F , G ) . Interestingly , this was also the case for three selective ER - phagy receptors , namely Calcoco1 , Rtn3 and Atl3 . Indeed , only four ER proteins ( Avl9 , Pggt1b , Prex2 , Derl1 ) were significantly enriched in the PV - atg5KO - TdT sample , none of which have known roles in calcium homeostasis . Taken together , these results suggest that contrary to what was found in glutamatergic neurons , ER homeostasis may not be impacted in autophagy - deficient interneurons , as is the case for excitatory glutamatergic neurons . Comparison of the differentially abundant proteins with the SynGO database indicated that 9 synaptic proteins were significantly downregulated ( Wasf1 , Atp2b4 , Camk4 , Frrs1l , Nos1 , Phb , Rab11 , Rplp2 and Vps33b ) and 23 synaptic proteins were significantly enriched ( Rps6kc1 , Tanc1 , Rab3b , Add3 , Cask , Tubb2b , Pfn1 , Vcp , septin - 6 , Synj2 , Tbc1d2b , Rock2 , Ywhah , Gnb5 , Atp2b1 , Stx2 , Scg2 , Rheb , Ywhaz , Sacm1l , Pafah1b1 , Add1 , Rps10 ) in PV - atg5KO - TdT neurons , when compared to control . Cellular component enrichment analysis of the deregulated synaptic proteins indicated that they are mainly localized in the postsynaptic specialization of asymmetric synapses , while some also showed a presynaptic localization ( Figure 2E ; schematically summarized in Figure 2F ) . The only deregulated synaptic protein involved in calcium homeostasis was Atp2b4 , a plasma membrane calcium ATPase that localizes to the presynaptic membrane , which was found to be significantly decreased in autophagy - deficient PV - interneurons , as confirmed by JESS - Western blot analysis ( Figure S2H ) . Another deregulated synaptic protein , Wasf1 , is a key component of the WAVE protein complex , a key regulator of the actin cytoskeleton formation through interactions with the Arp2 / 3 complex . In addition , recent work demonstrated that this machinery also links diverse cell surface receptors to the actin cytoskeleton , including the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , we examined whether expression of NR2B is affected in autophagy - deficient PV neurons . To this end , we performed Jess - Western analysis of the TdT - positive PV - interneurons sorted from control or PV - atg5KO - TdT mice using an antibody against NR2B and found a significant reduction in its total levels in the autophagy - deficient interneurons when compared to the control ( Figure 2G ) . In addition , we performed NR2B surface immunolabelling on hippocampal sections of control and PV - atg5KO - TdT mice and found that autophagy - deficient PV - interneurons exhibit a significant reduction in surface NR2B levels when compared to the control ( Figure 2H ) . In addition , another protein that was significantly downregulated is Frrs1l , an outer component of AMPA receptors ( Madeo et al . , 2016 ; Schwenk et al . , 2012 ) . With recent work Chalatsi et al . , 8 indicating that loss of Frrs1l leads to intracellular retention of GluA2 subunits ( Madeo et al . , 2016 ) , we also compared the surface expression of GluA2 in hippocampal sections of control and PV - atg5KO - TdT mice . We found that autophagy - deficient PV - interneurons exhibited a significant reduction in surface GluA2 levels ( Figure 2I ) . By contrast , surface labeling for the GluA1 subunit showed no differences between genotypes ( Figure 2J ) . Taken together , these findings indicated that autophagy - deficiency leads to changes in neurotransmitter receptor composition on the membrane of PV - interneurons . We then hypothesized whether these changes in synaptic proteostasis have repercussions on their function , subsequently affecting the networks in which they are embedded . To test this , we focused on the hippocampal CA1 region , where PV expression is restricted to inhibitory interneurons , mostly comprising of basket cells ( Donato et al . , 2015 ; Donato et al . , 2013 ) . Thus , to examine whether atg5 deletion influences PV neuronal excitability , we performed patch clamp recordings of current - evoked action potentials from acute brain slices of three - month - old - control ( pv - cre ; TdT tg / + ) and PV - atg5KO - TdT ( pv - cre ; atg5 f / f ; TdT tg / + ) mice ( Figure 3A ) . On average , the input - output curve in PV neurons from slices of PV - atg5KO - TdT mice presented a rightward shift compared to their control littermates , indicative of reduced neuronal excitability within this neuronal population ( Figure 3A , B ) . Next , we examined whether this reduced PV excitability has repercussion on GABAergic neurotransmission onto neighboring pyramidal cells ( PC ) in the CA1 region . Recording of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents ( sIPSCs ) from PC unraveled a reduction in the frequency , but not amplitude of events ( Figure 3C , D ) , concomitantly with an increased paired - pulse ratio of evoked IPSCs ( Figure 3E , F ) . Additionally , we probed excitatory ( â60 mV , EPSC ) and inhibitory synaptic transmission ( + 5 mV , IPSC ) which revealed enhanced EPSC to IPSC ratio ( EPSC / IPSC ) in PC from PV - atg5KO - TdT mice compared to control littermates ( Figure 3G , H ) . Taken together , these results support a diminished PV neuronal excitability , which accounts for a reduction in synaptic inhibition onto PC . The enhanced excitation / inhibition ratio onto PC , urged us to further investigate the presence of spontaneous epileptic seizures , as observed in mice with conditional ablation of autophagy in forebrain excitatory neurons ( Tang et al . , 2014 ) ( Overhoff , 2022 ) and human patients with mutations in autophagy genes ( Fassio et al . , 2020 ) . To this end , we performed frontal and parietal electroencephalogram ( EEG ) recordings in combination with electromyogram ( EMG ) in three - month - old control ( N = 8 mice ) and PV - atg5KO ( N = 7 mice ) animals for three consecutive light - dark phases . Animals cycled between the three vigilance states wake , non - rapid - eye - movement sleep ( NREM ) and rapid - eye - movement sleep ( REM ) , as evident by standard spectral Chalatsi et al . , 9 EEG signatures . Analysis of these recordings using the Epi - AI online peer - reviewed tool ( Wei et al . , 2021 ) , confirmed the absence of overt spontaneous epileptic seizures in the PV - atg5KO mice ( Figure 3I ) , indicating that perturbed autophagy in PV - positive cells may not contribute to epileptic phenotypes . As PV - interneuron activity has been implicated in memory ( Ognjanovski et al . , 2017 ; Tripodi et al . , 2018 ; Xia et al . , 2017 ) and anxiety ( Courtin et al . , 2014 ) , we then sought to determine whether impaired autophagy affects cognition via changes in PV - interneuron excitability . To this end , three - month - old control and PV - atg5KO mice were subjected to a fear conditioning test , a paradigm of associative memory ( see Methods , summarized in Figure 4A ) . While control and PV - atg5KO animals exhibited comparable freezing percentages during training , PV - atg5KO animals exhibited a significant reduction in freezing on the test day when compared to control littermates ( Figure 4B ) . Differences in freezing cannot be attributed to an impaired ability of PV - atg5KO animals to perceive the stimulus since both genotypes showed a significant increase in reactivity upon shock delivery ( Figure 4C ) . To further probe the involvement of autophagy in the regulation of memory processes , control and PV - atg5KO mice were subjected to a novel object recognition test , a paradigm of recognition memory ( see Methods , summarized in Figure 4D ) . The difference in time spent with the familiar or the novel object is measured as a discrimination index ( DI ) and it is a proxy for the memory for the familiar object . PV - atg5KO mice exhibited a significant decrease in their discrimination index compared to control littermates , indicating a defective memory for the familiar object ( Figure 4E ) . This deficit was neither due to differences in initial preference ( Figure 4F ) nor to differences in the cumulative duration spent exploring the objects ( Figure 4G ) . Taken together , these findings indicate that autophagy deficiency in parvalbumin neurons is sufficient to induce profound deficits in both associative and recognition memory . Lastly , to determine whether autophagy - deficient PV neurons impact anxiety - like behaviors , we tested control and PV - atg5KO mice in three anxiety tests : a ) the elevated plus maze ( EPM ) , b ) the light / dark box ( LD ) , and c ) the open field test ( OFT ) ( see Methods , summarized in Figures 4H - L ) . In all three tests , no significant differences were observed in the cumulative duration that PV - atg5KO animals spent in the open arm ( Figure 4I ) , in the light compartment ( Figure 4K ) or in the center of the arena ( Figure 4M ) when compared to control littermates . Moreover , the total locomotion of control and PV - atg5KO animals was comparable in all three tests ( Figure S3A - C ) . Taken together , these findings suggest that the described proteostatic and synaptic deficits of autophagy - deficient PV neurons , as well as of the networks in which they take part , do not culminate into changes in anxiety - like behaviors . Chalatsi et al . , 10 Discussion Emerging evidence from animal models suggests that the well - conserved autophagic machinery , which is fundamental for the turnover of proteins and organelles , is implicated in higher order behaviors that depend on the orchestrated function of multiple neuronal populations . However , our knowledge of the roles of autophagy at cellular and synaptic levels is thus far limited to glutamatergic and other projections neurons . Here we expanded this knowledge to other neuronal populations , demonstrating that autophagy regulates the homeostasis and physiology of parvalbumin - expressing interneurons , safeguarding hippocampal network dynamics and memory . While the physiological roles of autophagy in interneurons were overlooked , interneurons have already been implicated in the pathology of congenital diseases of autophagy , such as tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC ) , a disorder that manifests with severe synaptic and psychiatric deficits , including memory deficits ( Ridler et al . , 2007 ) , epilepsy , developmental delay , and autism ( Henske et al . , 2016 ) . In this disorder , autosomal dominant germline mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 genes lead to the hyperactivation of the mTORC1 pathway , an important positive regulator of protein translation and negative regulator of autophagy . Interestingly , mice with condition ablation of tsc1 in GABAergic interneuron progenitor cells ( Fu et al . , 2012 ) exhibit reduced numbers of GABAergic cells and synapses in the forebrain . Here , we directly tested whether autophagy regulates PV - interneuron numbers and whether it safeguards their maintenance in the brain but found no evidence for such a role . Instead , across all tested brain areas , PV - interneuron numbers where comparable between control mice and those lacking atg5 conditionally in PV - expressing neurons . Therefore , we conclude that autophagy is dispensable for the survival and maintenance of postmitotic PV - interneurons . We speculate that the interneuron loss observed in the tsc1 - conditional knockout model may be due to the concomitant deregulation of the translation machinery . Alternatively , it may also be due to the fact that ablation of tsc1 starts embryonically in GABAergic neuron progenitors , consistent with previous work showing that mTOR signaling regulates the early proliferation of these cells ( Ka et al . , 2017 ) . In this study , we directly examined for the first time the requirement of autophagy for inhibitory neurotransmission , focusing on PV - expressing interneurons of the hippocampus . We report that autophagy - deficient PV - interneurons are less excitable , compared to controls . Consistently , we also found reduced inhibitory input to neighboring excitatory neurons of the hippocampus of PV - atg5KO animals , compared to control littermates . Together , these findings demonstrate that autophagy - deficient PV - interneurons exhibit reduced basal transmission , which accounts for an imbalance in the excitation - inhibition equilibrium in the hippocampus . Our findings Chalatsi et al . , 11 help explain previous work , showing that loss of tsc1 reduces inhibitory synaptic transmission ( Bateup et al . , 2013 ; Khlaifia et al . , 2022 ) and results in fewer and smaller synapses formed by PV - interneurons , which are responsible for social deficits ( Amegandjin et al . , 2021 ) . As synaptic deficits of PV - interneurons are likely to also pertain to human TSC patients , restoring autophagy specifically in these cells may represent a novel strategy for reinstating inhibitory transmission and network balance , to ameliorate some aspects of the cognitive impairment pathology , such as memory , learning and sociability . A recent study reported that autophagy - deficient excitatory glutamatergic neurons exhibit enhanced basal transmission , which was attributed to the failed turnover of presynaptic ER and the consequent elevation of intracellular calcium stores ( Kuijpers et al . , 2021 ) . Taken together with our findings , it emerges that under basal conditions , autophagy regulates excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in diametrical ways , restricting the former , whereas enhancing the latter . The mechanisms by which autophagy regulates these two types of transmission may also be distinct . Unlike excitatory neurons , autophagy - deficient PV - interneurons do not exhibit impaired proteostasis of ER proteins or accumulation of selective ER - phagy receptors , although these proteins are well - detected in our proteomic analysis . We cannot exclude that calcium levels are implicated in the reduced inhibitory transmission of autophagy - deficient PV - interneurons , as the proteomic analysis of these neurons revealed significantly decreased levels of Atp2b4 , a P - type plasma membrane calcium ATPase ( PMCA ) , which is localized in the presynaptic membrane ( Stafford et al . , 2017 ) . However , we also found a significant reduction in Frrs1l and Wasf1 , which are involved in the plasma membrane retention and targeting of AMPA receptor and NMDA receptor subunits , respectively . This led us to reveal that autophagy indirectly regulates the surface levels of GluA2 and NR2B in PV - interneurons , both of which may be directly implicated in the reduced excitability of these neurons when autophagy is impaired . More generally , it also appears that the autophagic machinery sequesters and turns over distinct cellular substrates in different neuronal populations , adding yet another aspect of selectivity to its contribution to protein and organelle homeostasis . Finally , we found that while anxiety is unaffected , PV - atg5KO animals exhibit deficits in associative and recognition memory , two major components of declarative memory that mainly involve the hippocampus , among other brain areas . Previous work has clearly shown that conditional deletion of AMPA or NMDA receptor subunits in PV neurons causes reduced excitability of fast - spiking PV interneurons in the hippocampus , leading to impaired hippocampal network synchrony and memory deficits ( Korotkova et al . , 2010 ) ( Fuchs et al . , 2007 ) . Consistently , pharmacogenetic inhibition of hippocampal PV - expressing interneurons impairs hippocampal Chalatsi et al . , 12 network dynamics , leading to deficits in the consolidation of associative memory ( Ognjanovski et al . , 2017 ) . Therefore , we believe that the memory deficits of PV - at g5KO animals are attributed to the diminished activity of PV - interneurons in the hippocampus and not related to the loss of the cerebellar Purkinje cells , which are instead involved in implicit memories , including procedural memories and motor learning ( De Zeeuw and Ten Brinke , 2015 ) . In conclusion , it emerges that the requirement of autophagy for proper brain function relies on cell - type specific functions in different neuronal subpopulations . Here , we have highlighted the distinct roles played by autophagy in PV - expressing neurons . Whether autophagy regulates the neurotransmission of other types of inhibitory neurons , such as those expressing somatostatin , calretinin , VIP or other markers , remains to be investigated by future studies , in order to gain a complete picture on the collective impact of autophagy impairment on multi - neuronal networks .

Therefore , the animal protocols for the experiments performed in Greece were approved by the FORTH Animal Ethics Committee ( FEC ) based on the European Union guidelines on animal experimentation , while those performed in Switzerland were approved by the Swiss veterinary services of the Canton Vaud ( Licenses VD3460 , VD3461 ) . In both cases , special attention was paid to the implementation of the 3Rs , housing , the environmental conditions and analgesia , in order to ensure the animalsâ welfare . Mice were housed in Individually Ventilated Cages ( IVCs ; Innovive , France ) in groups of 3 - 5 per cage . Water and food were provided ad libitum with constant temperature ( 22ËC ) , humidity ( 55 % ) , air changes ( 60 / hour ) and a 12h / 12h light / dark cycle ( 7am ON / 7pm OFF ) , except for mice that are tested in EEG experiment where cycle was 9am ON / 9pm OFF ) . All mice were littermates and were randomly allocated to experimental conditions . A C57BL / 6 genetic background of at least for 20 generations was common in all crossings . We worked with the following genetically modified mice : atg5 f / f ( Hara et al . , 2006 ) , pv - cre + / - ( B6 ; 129P2 - Pvalbtm1 ( cre ) Arbr / J - Jax lab # strain 008069 ) ( Hippenmeyer et al . , 2007 ) and a cre reporter TdT tg / + ( B6 . Cg - Gt ( ROSA ) 26Sortm9 ( CAG - tdTomato ) Hze / J ) ( Madisen et al . , 2010 ) . A tg5 f / f mice were crossed with the pv - cre + / - mice to ablate atg5 in parvalbumin positive GABAergic neurons , generating ( pv - cre + / - ; atg5 f / f ) PV - atg5KO mice . pv - cre + / - and PV - atg5KO mice were also crossed with TdT tg / + mice to label the PV positive neurons ( pv - cre + / - ; atg5 f / f ; TdT tg / + ) PV - atg5KO - TdT . Male pv - cre + / - mice were not included in the breeding to exclude any possibility of unwanted germline recombination and global recombination due to the low expression of PV in sperm . The weight of control ( atg5 f / f ) , ( pv - cre + / - ) and PV - atg5KO ( pv - cre + / - ; atg5 f / f ) male littermates was monitored systematically and compared at two specific time points , namely at three - weeks and at three - months of age . Western Blotting Western blot was performed as previously described ( Nikoletopoulou et al . , 2017 ) with minor modifications . Briefly , tissues were lysed in RIPA Buffer ( 50mM Tris - Cl pH 7 . 4 , 150mM NaCl , 1mM EDTA , 1 % TritonX - 100 , 0 , 1 % SDS and 0 , 1 % sodium deoxycholate , supplemented with protease inhibitors . Tissues were sonicated for 20 seconds on ice and centrifuged twice for 30min at 16 . 200g in order to precipitate the DNA . BCA Protein Assay Kit was used to measure the protein concentration following manufacturerâs instructions and the proteins were separated using ( 7 . 5 - 15 % ) polyacrylamide gel and were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane which has a 0 . 2Î¼m pores size ( Millipore ) . The total protein levels were visualized and normalized on the Chalatsi et al . , 24 membrane , using the No - Stainâ¢ Protein Labeling Reagent , according to the manufacturerâs instruction . Then , the membrane was incubated in 5 % skim milk for 1hour and overnight in the primary antibody at 4Â°C . The membranes were washed three times ( 3x10min ) with TPBS pH 7 . 4 ( 137mM NaCl , 2 . 7mM KCl , 10mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 . 8mM KH 2 PO 4 , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ) and were incubated with a secondary horseradish peroxidase - conjugated - HRP antibody ( 1 : 10000 ) for 1h at room temperature . The membranes were washed three times ( 3x10min ) with TPBS and incubated with chemiluminescent solution ( SuperSignal West Pico and Femto Substrate - ThermoFisher Scientific ) according to the manufacturerâs instruction . The primary antibodies with their dilution which used for western blotting are presented in Table 1 . Data were calculated as the optical density ratio ( OD ) of the sample / total protein . All data were also expressed as the percentages of the average of the control group . Bands were quantified using Fiji Image J software , using the module of analyzing gels . Tissue fixation and cryo - protection For adult brain collection , all adult mice were transcardially perfused with cold 4 % PFA ( 4 % PFA in PBS pH 7 . 4 ) . Then brains were dissected and 3 hours post - fixation at 4Â°C was performed and then incubated in 30 % sucrose in PBS at 4Â°C until fully penetrated , for cryoprotection . Adult brains were then embedded in Tissue - Tek ( Tissue - Tek O . C . T . Compound ) on dry ice and stored at 80Â°C for cryo - sectioning . All brains were cut into coronal or sagittal sections of 16Î¼m and were placed on Superfrost Plus slides . Tissue slices were dried at 37Â°C for 2 - 3 hours and stored at - 80Â°C . For immunostaining , the process is described below in methods . Immunostaining Immunostaining was performed as previously described ( Nikoletopoulou et al . , 2017 ) . In brief , following fixation , 16Î¼m - thick brain sections were rinsed in PBS pH 7 . 4 ( 137mM NaCl , 2 . 7mM KCl , 10mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 . 8mM KH 2 PO 4 ) and incubated for 1 hour in blocking solution containing 1 % BSA and 0 . 2 - 0 . 5 % Triton - X ( depending on the antibody ) , in PBS pH 7 . 4 . Then , the sections were incubated in blocking solution containing primary antibody overnight at 4Â°C . Blocking solution without primary antibody was applied in separate samples to test for non - specific labeling . The primary antibodies and their final concentrations are summarized in the resource Table 1 . Subsequently , sections were rinsed three times ( 3x10min ) in PBS and incubated with the secondary antibodies , prepared in PBS , as indicated in resource table 2 , for 1 hour at room temperature . The nuclear dye Hoechst was used ( 1 : 5000 ) to stain nuclei . Tissue was rinsed three times ( 3x10min ) in PBS and mounted onto slides . Confocal images of fluorescently labeled Chalatsi et al . , 25 proteins were captured using the LSM 900 ( Zeiss ) . Images were analyzed by Fiji Image J or Imaris Softaware ( 9 . 6 . 1 version ) . TUNEL assay TUNEL staining was performed using the in - situ cell death detection kit ( Roche ) in sagittal paraffin sections of 4Î¼m . DNase treatment was applied to the tissue as a positive control , following the manufacturerâs instructions . Tissue dissociation and FACS Brains from control ( pv - cre ; TdT tg / + ) , mutants PV - atg5KOtdT ( pv - cre - ; atg5 f / f ; TdT tg / + ) and negative control ( atg5 f / f ; TdT tg / + ) , three - month - old , were isolated in cold PBS . The isocortex and hippocampal formation were dissected , and individual cells were isolated using the papain dissociation system , following manufacturerâs instruction . Subsequently , myelin elimination was performed using a Percoll gradient . 90 % of Percoll in PBS was prepared and the pH was adjusted to 7 . 4 ( Percoll Solution ) . 3ml of PBS and 1ml of the Percoll Solution was added the myelin - cleared material and mixed well . Then , 4ml of PBS was added to create two phases . Subsequently , the samples were centrifuged at 3000rcf for 10min at 4Â°C , with acceleration ramp at 1 and braking ramp at 0 . The supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet was resuspended in 1ml PBS ( Zehnder et al . , 2021 ) . The whole process is carried out on ice . Cell sorting ( FACS ) was performed using a MoFlo AstriosEQ High speed cell sorter . CLARITY and 3D image acquisition . Mice were transcardially perfused with 4 % PFA and the brain was dissected and was postfixed overnight in 4 % PFA . Brains were clarified following the CLARITY protocol ( Chung and Deisseroth , 2013 ) , using X - CLARITY TM system . Brains were immersed in a refractive index matching solution ( RIMS ) containing Histodenz ( Sigma Aldrich ) for at least 24 hours before being imaged . Imaging was performed using a mesoSPIM system at Wyss Center , Geneva ( Voigt et al . , 2019 ) . The microscope consists of a dual - sided excitation path using a fiber - coupled multiline laser combiner ( 405 , 488 , 561 and 647 nm , Toptica MLE ) and a detection path comprising a 42 Olympus MVX - 10 zoom macroscope with a 1Ã objective ( Olympus MVPLAPO 1Ã ) , a filter wheel ( Ludl 96A350 ) , and a scientific CMOS ( sCMOS ) camera ( Hamamatsu Orca Flash 4 . 0 V3 ) . The excitation paths also contain galvo scanners for light - sheet generation and reduction of shadow artifacts due to absorption of the light - sheet . In addition , the beam waist is scanned using electrically tunable lenses ( ETL , Optotune EL - 16 - 40 - 5D - TC - L ) synchronized with the rolling Chalatsi et al . , 26 shutter of the sCMOS camera . This axially scanned light - sheet mode ( ASLM ) leads to a uniform axial resolution across the field - of - view ( FOV ) of 5Î¼m . Image acquisition is done using custom software written in Python . Z - stacks were acquired with a zoom set at 1 . 25X at 5Î¼m spacing , respectively resulting in an in - plane pixel size of 5 . 26 X 5 . 26Î¼m ( 2048x2048 pixels ) . Excitation wavelength of the td - Tomato and autofluorescence channels were set at 561 and 488nm , respectively with an emission filter , 593 / 40 LP and 530 / 43 nm bandpass filter respectively ( BrightLine HC , AHF ) . Images were stitched and reconstructed in 3D using Arivis Vision 4D software . Registration to the Allen Reference Atlas , Mask Extraction and Segmentation Brain registration to Allen Brain Atlas Mouse brains were un - anisotropically down - sampled and registered to the 25Âµm Allen brain mouse atlas ( Lein et al . , 2007 ) using the AMAP pipeline ( Niedworok et al . , 2016 ) through Brainreg frontend ( Tyson et al . , 2021 ) using the autofluorescence channel . The affine registration was computed using 5 steps and the registration was computed for each affine step . The freeform registration was computed using 5 steps and the registration was computed on the last 3 steps only . The bending weight energy was set to 0 . 9 which was a good tradeoff for accommodating sample imperfections while maintaining high regularization to avoid overfitting the data . All other parameters were kept as default . Mask creation for sub - region segmentation To accelerate the segmentation in Arivis Vision 4D software , we restricted the volume on which the segmentation was performed by using a binary mask of the volume of interest . To create the binary masks , we used a custom developed tool which interface with the Allen Brain Atlas API and automatically generates any region as a binary mask . This tool allows to create a mask using Allen Brain Atlas region names or acronyms . It automatically and efficiently looks for childrenâs regions to create masks and allows the user to batch create masks when the input is a list of regions . The output binary masks were produced at 25Âµm isotropic resolution for memory footprint efficiency and resampled later in Arivis Vision 4D software at the sample resolution for the segmentation step . Segmentation The masked region was imported into Arivis Vision 4D software and used for the creation of 3D masked region for cell counting analysis . Td - Tomato positive cells ( PV - cells ) and neuronal fibers Chalatsi et al . , 27 were classified using random forest machine learning - based algorithm ( ML ) . Due to the diversity of the brain areas and heterogeneity of background of whole brains scans , the ML algorithm was trained blindly for each brain area and sample . Based on the ML training the 3D objects were segmented and filtered by features , as volume ( voxel count ) and object sphericity using Arivis Vision 4D software . The raw counted cells were normalized by masked region volume . Proteomic Analysis Protein Digestion Replicate samples were digested according to a modified version of the iST method ( Kulak et al . , 2014 ) ( named miST method ) . Briefly , frozen cell pellets were resuspended in 30ul miST lysis buffer ( 1 % Sodium deoxycholate , 100mM Tris pH 8 . 6 , 10mM DTT ) by vortexing . Resuspended samples were heated at 95Â°C for 5min . Samples were then diluted 1 : 1 ( v : v ) with water containing 4mM MgCl2 and Benzonase ( Merck # 70746 , 100x dil of stock = 250 Units / Î¼l ) and incubated for 15 minutes at RT to digest nucleic acids . Reduced disulfides were alkylated by adding Â¼ vol of 160mM chloroacetamide ( final 32mM ) and incubating at 25Â°C for 45min in the dark . Samples were adjusted to 3mM EDTA and digested with 0 . 2Î¼g Trypsin / LysC mix ( Promega # V5073 ) for 1 hour at 37Â°C , followed by a second 1 hour digestion with a second and identical aliquot of proteases . To remove sodium deoxycholate , two sample volumes of isopropanol containing 1 % TFA were added to the digests , and the samples were desalted on a strong cation exchange ( SCX ) plate ( Oasis MCX ; Waters Corp . , Milford , MA ) by centrifugation . After washing with isopropanol / 1 % TFA , peptides were eluted in 200ul of 80 % MeCN , 19 % water , 1 % ( v / v ) ammonia . Liquid Chromatography - tandem Mass spectrometry Eluates after SCX desalting were dried and resuspended in variable volumes of 0 . 05 % trifluoroacetic acid , 2 % acetonitrile to equilibrate concentrations . 1Î¼g of each sample was injected on column for nanoLC - MS analysis . MS analysis Data - dependent LC - MS / MS analyses of samples were carried out on a Fusion Tribrid Orbitrap mass spectrometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) interfaced through a nano - electrospray ion source to an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano HPLC system ( Dionex ) . Peptides were separated on a reversed - phase custom packed 40cm C18 column ( 75Î¼m ID , 100Ã , Reprosil Pur 1 . 9Î¼m particles , Dr . Maisch , Germany ) with a 4 - 90 % acetonitrile gradient in 0 . 1 % formic acid ( total time 140min ) . Full MS survey scans were performed at 120 ' 000 resolution . A data - dependent acquisition method Chalatsi et al . , 28 controlled by Xcalibur 4 . 2 software ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) was used that optimized the number of precursors selected ( âtop speedâ ) of charge 2 + to 5 + while maintaining a fixed scan cycle of 0 . 6sec . HCD fragmentation mode was used at a normalized collision energy of 32 % , with a precursor isolation window of 1 . 6m / z , and MS / MS spectra were acquired in the ion trap . Peptides selected for MS / MS were excluded from further fragmentation during 60sec . MS Data analysis Tandem MS data were processed by the MaxQuant software ( version 1 . 6 . 14 ) ( Cox and Mann , 2008 ) incorporating the Andromeda search engine ( Cox et al . , 2011 ) . The UniProt Mus musculus reference proteome ( RefProt ) database of August 26th , 2020 was used ( 55â508 sequences ) , supplemented with sequences of common contaminants . Trypsin ( cleavage at K , R ) was used as the enzyme definition , allowing 2 missed cleavages . Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified as a fixed modification . N - terminal acetylation of protein and oxidation of methionine were specified as variable modifications . All identifications were filtered at 1 % FDR at both the peptide and protein levels with default MaxQuant parameters . MaxQuant data were further processed with Perseus software ( Tyanova et al . , 2016 ) . iBAQ ( Schwanhausser et al . , 2011 ) values were used for quality control assessment , after which LFQ values ( Cox et al . , 2011 ) were used for quantitation after log2 transformation . Only protein groups were retained which had all four valid values in at least one condition . In the resulting table , missing values were imputed with values determined from a normal distribution ( parameters used in Perseus : width 0 . 3 and down - shift 2 . 2 SD ) . Jess - WB analysis Cell pellets were resuspended in SDS lysis buffer ( 50mM Tris pH 6 . 8 , 2 % SDS , 5 % glycerol , 2mM DTT , 2 . 5mM EDTA , 2 . 5mM EGTA , 4mM NaVO4 , 20mM NaF complemented with Complete Protease inhibitors and PhosStop ( Roche ) ) and heated 10min at 65Â°C . Then , 4 . 8Î¼l of protein extracts were subjected to the capillary - based immunoassay Jess system ( ProteinSimple ) using the 12 - 230kDa separation module ( ProteinSimple SM - W004 ) with the Replex ( RP - 001 ) and the Total Protein ( DM - TP01 ) modules according to the manufacturerâs instructions . Analyses were performed using the Compass software version 6 . 1 . Peaks were determined using the dropped line method and data were normalized to the Total Protein . Chalatsi et al . , 29 In vitro electrophysiology The mice 11 - 13 weeks were anesthetized ( ketamine / xylazine ; 150mg / 100mg / kg ) , sacrificed , and their brains were transferred in ice - cold carbogenated ( 95 % O 2 / 5 % CO 2 ) solution , containing ( in mM ) choline chloride 110 ; glucose 25 ; NaHCO 3 25 ; MgCl 2 7 ; ascorbic acid 11 . 6 ; sodium pyruvate 3 . 1 ; KCl 2 . 5 ; NaH 2 PO 4 1 . 25 ; CaCl 20 . 5 . Coronal brain slices ( 250Î¼m thickness ) were prepared and transferred for 5min to warmed solution ( 34Â°C ) of identical composition , before transfer at room temperature in carbogenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( ACSF ) containing ( in mM ) NaCl 124 ; NaHCO 3 26 . 2 ; glucose 11 ; KCl 2 . 5 ; CaCl 2 2 . 5 ; MgCl 2 1 . 3 ; NaH 2 PO 4 1 . During recordings , slices were immersed in ACSF and continuously super fused at a flow rate of 2 . 5mL minâ1 at 32Â°C . Neurons were patch - clamped using borosilicate glass pipettes ( 2 . 7 â 4MÎ© ; Phymep , France ) under an Olympus - BX51 microscope ( Olympus , France ) . Signal was amplified , filtered at 5kHz and digitized at 10kHz ( Multiclamp 200B ; Molecular Devices , USA ) . Data were acquired using Igor Pro with NIDAQ tools ( Wavemetrics , USA ) . Access resistance was continuously monitored with a â4mV step delivered at 0 . 1Hz . Extracellular stimulation from AMPI ISO - Flex stimulator was delivered through glass electrodes placed nearby the pyramidal cell patched . Current - clamp recordings were obtained using an internal solution containing ( in mM ) : potassium gluconate 140 ; KCl 5 ; HEPES 10 ; EGTA 0 . 2 ; MgCl 2 2 ; Na 2 ATP 4 ; Na 3 GTP 0 . 3 mM ; creatine phosphate 10 . Current - clamp experiments were performed by a series of current steps ( negative to positive ) injected to induce action potentials ( - 20 , 0 , 20 , 80 , 160 , 320 , 400pA injection current , 800ms ) . For recordings in voltage - clamp configuration , evoked EPSCs were recorded at - 60mV while evoked and spontaneous inhibitory currents were recorded at + 5mV . Internal solution contained ( in mM ) CsMeSO 3 120 , CsCl 10 , HEPES 10 , EGTA 10 , creatine phosphate 5 ; Na 2 ATP 4 ; Na 3 GTP 0 . 4 , QX - 314 5 . All drugs were purchased from HelloBio . Polysomnographic EEG / EMG recordings Control ( atg5 f / f ) and PV - atg5KO ( pv - cre ; atg5 f / f ) male littermates , three - month - old , were used under a 12h / 12h light / dark cycle ( light onset at 9 : 00 AM ) . EEG and EMG electrodes were implanted as described ( Fernandez et al . , 2017 ) . Briefly , animals underwent a gas anesthesia ( 1 - 2 % isoflurane with O 2 ) and gold - plated electrodes were implanted over the dura mater through frontal and parietal bones in order to acquire frontal and parietal EEG recordings . Two EMG electrodes ( gold pellets ) were inserted into the neck muscles . A silver wire ( Harvard Apparatus ) implanted in the bone of cerebellum was used as ground and neutral reference to record referential EEG signals . Electrodes were glued to the skull ( cyanoacrylate ) , soldered to a male - to - male connector , and covered with dental cement ( Palavit , Heraeus Kulzer GmbH ) . Chalatsi et al . , 30 Paracetamol ( 2mg / ml ) was diluted into the drinking water for 7 days of recovery after the surgery , and an additional week of adaptation to the freely moving cabling system . Animals were monitored according to a score sheet established with the Veterinarian Authorities . Signals were recorded in freely moving conditions with animals in their home cage , amplified , digitized and acquired ( RHD2132 amplifier chip , connected to a RHD USB interface board C3100 from Intan Technologies , Los Angeles , CA ) at 1000Hz sampling frequency via Matlab recording software and Intan Matlab toolbox . Seizure and epileptic events detection For the seizure and epileptic event detection , we used the following free online software ( https : / / lifescience . ucd . ie / Epi - AI / ) , as described ( Wei et al . , 2021 ) . Behavioral analyses Open field test ( OFT ) Two - month - old control ( atg5 f / f ) and PV - atg5KO ( pv - cre - ; atg5 f / f ) male littermates were habituated in the behavioral room in single cages for at least 1 hour before each experiment . Anxiety - like behavior was assessed in a PVC square open field arena ( L = 45cm , W = 45cm and H = 30cm ) with gray opaque walls , where a central square zone was virtually marked 15cm from the four walls of the arena . The ambient illumination was 20lx in the chamber ( measurement without infrared light ) . Infrared light ( 850nm ) was used during the experiment to improve the contrast and tracking detection . Mice were placed for 20min in the arena and their body - center was tracked with EthoVision XT15 ( Noldus Information Technology , Wageningen , The Netherlands ) . Total distance ( cm ) , velocity ( cm / s ) , number of entries in the center zone , and the percentage of time spent in the center zone were scored . Mice were tested between 10 : 00am and 3 : 00pm . Light / Dark test Two - month - old control ( atg5 f / f ) and PV - atg5KO ( pv - cre - ; atg5 f / f ) male littermates were tested for their preference for the dark or light compartment of a two - chambered arena , using the Noldus Light / Dark set up . In this set up , the dark compartment ( L = 20cm , W = 20cm , H = 20 cm ) is smaller than the light compartment ( L = 40cm , W = 20cm , H = 20cm ) . The two compartments were separated by a manually - operated sliding door . The walls and ceiling of the dark compartment were permeable to infrared light , allowing optimal mouse tracking . The ambient illumination was 3 - 4lx in the dark and 600 - 700lx in the light compartment ( measurement without infrared light ) . Mice were habituated in single cages inside the experimental room for at least 1 hour prior the test . Chalatsi et al . , 31 During the test , every mouse was placed in the dark compartment with the door closed . After 10sec , the sliding door was opened manually , allowing free transition between compartments for 5min . The frequency to shuttle between compartments and the time spent in each compartment were scored using EthoVision XT15 ( Noldus Information Technologies ) . The frequency of transition between the areas , the duration , the total distance ( cm ) and the velocity ( cm / s ) were measured throughout the test session . Mice were tested between 10 : 00am and 3 : 00pm . Elevated Plus Maze ( EPM ) Two - month - old control ( atg5 f / f ) and PV - atg5KO ( pv - cre - ; atg5 f / f ) male littermates , were subjected to Elevated Plus Maze ( EPM ) for evaluation of anxiety - like behavior . The EPM ( Noldus Information Technologies ) is a cross - shaped arena elevated from the floor ( H : 47cm ) consisting of two open and two closed arms ( dimensions of each arm : L = 36cm , W = 6cm ) . The arms are infra - red backlit to optimize the tracking of the mouse in closed arms . The ambient illumination was measured in the closed arm ( 4 - 6lx ) , in the center ( 40 - 60lx ) , and in the open arm ( 104 - 108lx ) . The mice were habituated in single cages inside the testing room for 1 hour before the test . Each mouse was individually placed in the center of the EPM facing one of the close arms and was allowed to freely explore the maze for 5min . The number of transitions between the open and closed arms , the percent time spent inside the zones of the maze , the total distance traveled ( cm ) , and the velocity ( cm / s ) were monitored with EthoVision XT15 ( Noldus Information Technologies ) . Anxiety - like was measured as an increase in closed arms activity ( either duration or number entries ) . Mice were tested between 10 : 00am and 3 : 00pm . Spontaneous activity Test Spontaneous activity of two to three - month - old Control ( atg5 f / f ) and PV - atg5KO ( pv - cre ; atg5 f / f ) male littermates was measured in the PhenoTyper 3000 ( Noldus Information Technologies ) . The PhenoTyper 3000 is a home - cage for mice ( L : 30cm x W : 30cm ) optimized for video tracking , via EthoVisionXT14 ( Noldus Information Technologies ) . Mice were placed in the Phenotypers during the light phase ( 2 : 00 - 3 : 00pm ) and were housed in this cage for 72 hours without any further human handling . Regular food and water were provided ad libitum during this time . Video tracking started at 7 : 00pm . A set of spontaneous behavior parameters ( described in ( Loos et al . , 2014 ) were collected : Food and water consumption , locomotion , sheltering , dark light index , dark light phase transition . Chalatsi et al . , 32 Rotarod Test Three - month - old control ( atg5 f / f ) and PV - atg5KO ( pv - cre ; atg5 f / f ) male littermates were subjected to the rotarod test in order to evaluate their motor coordination and balance as previously described ( Dominguez - Iturza et al . , 2019 ) . Each mouse was habituated in a single cage inside the experimental room for at least 1 hour . The ambient illumination of the experimental room was 25 - 30lx . Mice were habituated on the rotarod apparatus for 2min at constant speed ( 4rpm ) . After 10min , they were tested on rotarod for 3 trials of 5min with an inter - trial interval of 10 min . The speed of rotarod was accelerated from 4rpm to 40rpm during the 5 - min trial . The latency to fall off from the rod was recorded . The average latency to fall as well as the latency to fall per trial were measured in these 5min trials . Mice were tested between 10 . 00am and 3 : 00pm . Novel Object Recognition Test ( NOR ) Three - month - old control ( atg5 f / f ) and PV - atg5KO ( pv - cre ; atg5 f / f ) male littermates were subjected to a two - day NOR test . On each day , mice were habituated in single cages inside the experimental room , at least 1 hour before testing . The first day , mice are individually placed inside an open arena ( L = 45cm , W = 45 cm and H = 30cm ) with gray PVC opaque walls in dim light conditions ( 20lx ) . The arena was filled with bedding ( 2cm ) in all trials . On the first day , the mouse was habituated inside the empty arena for two 10 - min - trials . During the following three trials ( inter trial interval = 5min ) , two identical objects ( lego ) were placed in the arena and the mouse was free to explore the objects for 10min . At the end of third object exploration trial , the mouse was brought back to its own home cage in the animal vivarium . Twenty - four hours later , mice were individually placed inside the arena for one trial with one familiar object and a novel object . The objects were located at the same distance from each wall ( 15cm ) . Mouse activity was tracked with EthoVision XT 14 software ( Noldus Information Technologies ) . The distance travelled per trial , the time spent exploring each object , the object exploration time per each trial , and the discrimination index were measured . Discrimination index was calculated using the following formula : Discrimination Index ( % ) = [ time spent exploring the novel object new - time spent exploring the familiar one / total time spending in objects ] X100 % . Mice were tested between 10 : 00am and 3 : 00pm . Fear Conditioning Test Three - month - old control ( atg5 f / f ) and PV - atg5KO ( pv - cre ; atg5 f / f ) male littermates were subjected to a two - day Contextual Fear Conditioning test . Mice were first habituated in single cages inside the experimental room at least 1 hour before testing . Each mouse was placed individually in the fear conditioning chamber ( Ugo Basile , srl ) , which is composed of 4 transparent Plexiglas walls Chalatsi et al . , 33 and an electrified metal grid floor . After 2 minutes of free exploration , two mild foot - shocks ( 0 . 5mA , 2sec ) separated by one minute interval , were delivered through the grid - floor . Thirty seconds after the termination of the second foot - shock , the mouse was placed back to its own home cage . Memory for the association between the context and the aversive stimulus was probed 24 hours later for 5min inside the same conditioning chamber used during the training session . An overhead camera connected to the software Ethovision XT15 ( Noldus Information Technology ) automatically monitors freezing behavior ( i . e . crouched posture and absence of any movement except respiratory movements ) throughout the training and test sessions . Percentage of time spent freezing during the test session is used as a proxy measure for the memory of the association formed during the training session . The current of the foot shock was measured in every experiment to ensure that it corresponds to 0 . 5mA . Mice were tested between 10 : 00am and 3 : 00pm . Statistical analysis Analyses were performed via GraphPad Prism software for behavioral test and for molecular and biochemical analysis . The statistical tests are reported in the respective figure legend . Briefly , unpaired two - tailed Studentâs t - tests were used for comparison between two groups . For comparison of two groups and two variances , two - way ANOVA , Multiple - t - test with Tukey or Bonferroni or Holm - Sidakâs multiple comparison correction was used among groups . For all data analysis , p < 0 . 05 was considered as significant and reported as follows : * p < 0 . 05 , * * pâ¤0 . 01 , * * * pâ¤0 . 001 and * * * * pâ¤0 . 0001 . Results were presented as mean and standard error of mean ( Â±SEM ) . Power Analysis An a priori power analysis was conducted using G * Power version 3 . 1 ( Faul et al . , 2007 ) to determine the sample size required to test differences between control and PV - atg5KO mice in anxiety - like tests ( EPM , LD box and OFT ) . Results showed the minimum sample size to achieve 80 % power 1 - Î² = 0 . 8 ( probability of Type II error ) for detecting a medium effect , at a significance criterion of Î± = 0 . 05 ( probability of Type I error ) and analyzed with a two - tailed Student ' s t test .
