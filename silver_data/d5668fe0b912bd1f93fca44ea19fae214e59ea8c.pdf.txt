The cellular uptake of exosomes occurs by endocytosis ; however , the cytosolic release efficiency of encapsulated molecules inside cells is low . To address this issue , here we demonstrate a simple technique for enhancing the cellular uptake and cytosolic release of exosomes by combining a pH - sensitive fusogenic peptide for the fusion of endosomal and exosomal membranes inside cells . This method stimulates the efficient cytosolic release of the exosomal contents with cationic lipids that act as a “glue” to support cellular uptake . Using this simple combined technique , the effective cellular uptake and cytosolic release of an artificially encapsulated dextran macromolecule ( 70 kDa ) in exosomes are achieved , and a marked improvement in bioactivity is attained with the artificially encapsulated ribosome - inactivating protein saporin . Our method will contribute to many biological research fields , including the assessment of the activities of exosomal contents and the development of candidate tools enabling intracellular visualisation and cellular regulation for future therapeutic applications . Most cells constitutively secrete exosomes , which are vesicles ~ 100 nm in diameter with a lipid bilayer morphology found in abundance in body fluids including blood , saliva , urine , and breast milk 1 , 2 . For example , human blood serum contains approximately 3 , 000 , 000 exosomes per microliter 2 . Because exosomes transport genetic material ( e . g . , microRNA ) and bioactive proteins , they function in cell - to - cell communication , signal transduction for cellular regulation , and modulation of the immune response 1 – 3 . In cell - to - cell communication , exosomes also serve as vehicles for shuttling various biological molecules between cells for regulatory purposes , including membrane receptors , proteins , mRNA and microRNA 1 . Exosomes transport biofunctional materials to neighbouring cells via endocytosis , including tetraspanin membrane proteins ( CD9 , CD63 , CD81 , CD82 ) , heat shock proteins ( Hsp70 , Hsp90 ) , proteins involved in multivesicular body biogenesis ( Alix , TSG101 ) , and other bioactive proteins ( GTPases , annexins , flo - tillin ) ; raft - associated lipids such as cholesterol , ceramide , sphingolipids , phosphoglycerides and phos - pholipases are also contained in exosomes 4 , 5 . Additionally , the function of exosomal membrane proteins ( e . g . , CD9 , CD81 ) as ligands for endocytosis has been reported ; however , the nature of the complicated cellular uptake mechanisms are still under debate 6 – 9 . Various types of disease - related cells including tumour cells secrete exosomes that carry specific microRNAs ( e . g . , miR - 1246 ( esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ) , miR - 1229 ( colon cancer ) ) , and detection of exosomal microRNA is considered a potential method for disease diagnosis . Therefore , diagnostic technologies based on exosomal microRNAs are being urgently developed , and these technologies are highly anticipated as promising future diagnostic 1 Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Research Center , Research Organization for the 21st Century , Osaka Prefecture University , Naka - ku , Sakai , Osaka 599 - 8570 , Japan . 2 Institute for Chemical Research , Kyoto University , Uji , Kyoto 611 - 0011 , Japan .

Conversely , exosomes have been recently being studied as natural nanomaterials for the delivery of bioactive genes 1 , 3 , 13 – 15 and for therapeutic treatment including , for example , the knockdown of BACE1 as a therapeutic target in Alzheimer’s disease 16 . Exosomes have great advantages as drug delivery carriers because of very low cytotoxicity , non - immunogenicity , constitutive secretion from cells , original and artificial encapsulation of bioactive molecules ( especially microRNAs ) , and the protein - engineering of the exosomal membrane 17 . However , because a high amount of exosomes in bodily fluids induces com - petition for their cellular uptake by endocytosis 8 , 18 , the cellular uptake efficiency of exosomal vehicles for intracellular delivery is considered insufficient for therapeutic treatment . New technology to enhance the cytosolic release of exosome contents is also strongly needed to achieve effective biological and thera - peutic activities of molecules contained in exosomes inside targeted cells . When exosomes are taken up by cells and trafficked by endosomal pathways , the exosome contents suffer from molecular digestion during the process of endosomal maturation , and the biological activities of the exosome contents might be reduced before their release from exosomes and endosomes inside cells . Recently , cellular targeting of exosomes by fusion of cell receptor recognition proteins such as rabies viral glycoprotein ( RVG ) 16 and integrin - specific iRGD peptide for α v integrin targeting 19 with exosomal membrane proteins was reported ; however , new techniques for enhanced cellular uptake and the cytosolic release of exosomal contents need to be developed to achieve sophisticated delivery vehicles . In this report , we propose a simple and effective technique for enhancing the cytosolic release of exo - somal contents using commercially available cationic lipids and a pH - sensitive fusogenic peptide ( Fig . 1 ) . We previously reported that a combination of cationic lipids and a pH - sensitive fusogenic peptide , GALA , significantly enhanced endosomal release of proteins that were conjugated with the GALA peptide 20 , 21 into the cytosol , and we have now applied this methodology for enhanced cytosolic delivery of exoso - mal contents . The addition of a commercially available cationic lipid formulation , Lipofectamine LTX , highly enhances the cellular uptake of CD63 - green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - tagged exosomes without any cytotoxicity by combining the cationic lipid treatment with exosomes that have a negatively - charged Figure 1 . Schematic representation of the cytosolic delivery of exosomal cargos with a combination of cationic lipids and the pH - sensitive fusogenic GALA peptide . Cationic lipids and the GALA peptide enhance cell membrane binding and the cellular uptake of exosomes . After cellular uptake by endocytosis , a pH decrease in the endosomes increases the helical content of the GALA peptide , leading to fusion of endosomal and exosomal membranes in cells and the cytosolic release of exosomal cargos . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 3 Scientific RepoRts | 5 : 10112 | DOi : 10 . 1038 / srep10112 exosomal membrane . We also achieved the efficient cytosolic release of exosomal contents in an endo - cytotic pathway using the GALA peptide by the combination of exosomes and cationic lipids that work as “glue” to accumulate targeted cellular membranes and enhance cellular uptake and cytosolic release ( Fig . 1 ) . The cellular uptake of artificially encapsulated dextran ( 70 kDa ) in exosomes was significantly enhanced by the combined treatment , leading to the efficient cytosolic release of encapsulated dextran from exosomes inside cells . In addition , intracellular delivery of a ribosome - inactivating protein , saporin , using exosomes was also achieved using cationic lipids and GALA peptides , leading to the efficient induction of cytotoxicity in targeted cells . Results Effect of cationic lipids on cellular uptake of exosomes . As mentioned in the Introduction , exosomes participate in cell - to - cell communication by secretion and the cellular uptake of exosomes loaded with regulatory molecules ( e . g . , microRNAs ) . However , negatively charged exosomal mem - branes 22 – 24 repel negatively charged cellular membranes . Because the high abundance of exosomes in serum also leads to competition for their cellular uptake , the internalisation efficiency of exosomes into cells is low and slow . Therefore , further development of strategies for the enhanced cellular uptake of exosomes is urgently required for the delivery of therapeutic molecules . We examined the cellular uptake of exosomes using a commercially available transfection reagent , Lipofectamine LTX , which con - tains cationic lipids that can act as a “glue” for pasting exosomes to targeted cells ( Fig . 1 ) . We studied exosomes that have a negatively charged membrane . Tetraspanin CD63 protein is a marker of exoso - mal membrane protein , and green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - fused CD63 stably - expressing HeLa cells ( CD63 - GFP - HeLa ) ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) were prepared as described in the Methods section . Secreted CD63 - GFP - exosomes were isolated from the cell culture medium using the Total Exosome Isolation kit , and expression of the exosomal marker proteins CD63 fused with GFP ( Supplementary Fig . 1b and c ) and CD9 ( Supplementary Fig . 1d ) was detected by western blot analysis . Exosomal morphology was also observed by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) ( Supplementary Fig . 1e ) . HeLa cells were treated with the CD63 - GFP - exosomes ( 20 μ g / ml of proteins ) in α - minimal essential medium ( MEM ) containing 10 % foetal bovine serum ( FBS ) for 24 h at 37 °C , but the fluorescent signals of the exosomes inside the cells were difficult to observe using a confocal microscope because of the very low cellular uptake efficacy under these conditions ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . We next examined the effect of cationic lipids on the cellular uptake of the exosomes . The CD63 - GFP - exosomes were mixed with a commercially available cationic lipid formulation , Lipofectamine LTX , which has been widely used for gene transfection 25 as described in the Methods section . The zeta - potential of the exosome / LTX complex was shown to be − 1 . 15 mV as analysed using a zeta - potential analyser . The average diameter of the exosomes was 78 nm as analysed by TEM ( Fig . 2b ) . Conversely , the average diameter of the original isolated exosomes without the addition of Lipofectamine LTX was 57 nm , as analysed by TEM ( Supplementary Fig . 1e ) . The zeta - potential of isolated exosomes was shown to be − 11 . 58 mV as analysed using a zeta - potential analyser , which was similar to previously reported results 22 – 24 , suggesting a reduction of the negative charge of the exosomal membrane by the addition of Lipofectamine LTX . The cellular uptake efficiency of the CD63 - GFP - exosomes in combination with Lipofectamine LTX was analysed using a confocal microscope ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Fig . 2a ) and a flow cytometer ( Fig . 2c ) . HeLa cells were treated with CD63 - GFP - exosomes ( 20 μ g / ml of proteins ) and Lipofectamine LTX ( 0 – 4 . 0 % ( v / v ) ) in α - MEM containing 10 % FBS for 24 h at 37 °C , prior to confocal microscopic analysis . The addition of Lipofectamine LTX was shown to significantly affect the cellular uptake of CD63 - GFP - exosomes , and for example , treatment with 4 . 0 % ( v / v ) Lipofectamine LTX increased the internalisation of the exosomes into HeLa cells by approximately 15 - fold ( Fig . 2c ) , suggesting that the addition of Lipofectamine LTX effectively enhances the cellular uptake efficiency of exosomes . Colocalization of endosome marker DiD and internalized CD63 - GFP - exosomes was observed by the combined treatment with Lipofectamine LTX ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) . However , a WST - 1 assay for the detection of cell viability showed that a high concentration of Lipofectamine LTX induced cytotoxicity ( e . g . , treatment of 8 . 0 % Lipofectamine LTX resulted in ~ 90 % cell death ) ( Fig . 2d ) , suggesting that it was necessary to optimise the cationic lipid content for the cellular uptake efficiency of exosomes versus cyto - toxicity . The effect of cationic lipids on the cellular uptake of exosomes was also examined in CHO - K1 cells ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Under the same experimental conditions as described for Fig . 2a , c , the cellular uptake efficiency of CD63 - GFP - exosomes was significantly increased by a combination including Lipofectamine LTX . For example , Lipofectamine LTX ( 4 . 0 % ( v / v ) ) increased cellular uptake efficiency of exosomes by approximately 175 - fold by CHO - K1 cells ( Supplementary Fig . 3a and b ) . Conversely , a high concentration of Lipofectamine LTX also enhanced cytotoxicity ( Supplementary Fig . 3c ) . A combination treatment with Lipofectamine LTX for CD63 - GFP - exosomes that were isolated by ultracentrifugation as described in the Methods section was also tested , and similar results showing enhanced cellular uptake efficiency of the exosomes were observed ( e . g . , approximately 11 - fold enhanced cellular uptake by the combination treatment of 2 . 0 % ( v / v ) Lipofectamine LTX under the same experimental conditions as described for Fig . 2c ) . Cellular uptake of CD63 - GFP - exosomes at lower concentrations ( 1 – 10 μ g / ml of protein ) was also significantly enhanced by addition of Lipofectamine LTX . For example , ~ 6 - fold enhancement in cellular www . nature . com / scientificreports / 4 Scientific RepoRts | 5 : 10112 | DOi : 10 . 1038 / srep10112 uptake of CD63 - GFP - exosomes ( 5 μ g / ml ) was attained by the combination treatment with 2 . 0 % ( v / v ) Lipofectamine LTX ( Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . However , as in the case of Fig . 2d , the addition of excess Lipofectamine LTX yielded considerable cell death ( Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . Cellular uptake of a pH - sensitive fusogenic peptide , GALA , treated with exosomes and cati - onic lipids . Endocytosis has been shown to be a major pathway for the cellular uptake of exosomes 6 – 9 , and barriers imposed by endosomal and exosomal membranes interfere with the cytosolic release of exosomal contents . Therefore , the cytosolic release efficiency of the exosomal contents ( e . g . , genes and proteins ) greatly influences their bioactivities in targeted cells . We previously reported that a pH - sensitive fusogenic peptide , GALA , can enhance the disruption of the endosomal membrane , leading to the effi - cient cytosolic release of proteins that were conjugated with the GALA peptide inside of the cells 20 , 21 . A 30 - residue amphipathic peptide with a repeating sequence of glutamic acid - alanine - leucine - alanine ( the amino acid sequence of GALA is WEAALAEALAEALAEHLAEALAEALEALAA ) was designed to mimic a viral fusion protein sequence that mediates the escape of viral genes from acidic endosomes to the cytosol 26 , 27 . The GALA peptide converts the structure from random to helical when the pH is reduced from 7 . 5 to 5 . 0 , leading to membrane fusion 26 , 27 . Cationic lipids were also employed to cause the accumulation of the GALA peptide , which carries a negative charge from glutamic acids ( 7 residues ) , on the cell surface and accelerate cellular uptake 20 , 21 . In this research , we investigated an application of the GALA peptide in a combined treatment of exosomes with cationic lipids for the fusion of exosomal and endosomal membranes inside cells and the enhanced cytosolic release of exosomal contents ( Fig . 1 ) . Figure 3a and b show the cellular uptake of FITC - labelled GALA ( FITC - GALA ) peptides . HeLa cells were treated with exosomes ( without expression of CD63 - GFP , 20 μ g / ml ) and FITC - GALA ( 2 μ M ) in Figure 2 . Increased cellular uptake of exosomes by treatment with cationic lipids . ( a ) Confocal microscopic observation of HeLa cells treated with CD63 - GFP - exosomes ( 20 μ g / ml ) in the presence or absence of Lipofectamine LTX ( 2 or 4 % ( v / v ) ) for 24 h at 37 °C ( blue : Hoechst33342 , green : CD63 - GFP - exosomes ) .

The data are the averages ( ± SD ) of three ( c ) and four ( d ) experiments . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 5 Scientific RepoRts | 5 : 10112 | DOi : 10 . 1038 / srep10112 the presence or absence of Lipofectamine LTX ( 2 % ( v / v ) ) in α - MEM containing 10 % FBS for 6 h at 37 °C , prior to analysis by confocal microscopy ( Fig . 3a ) and flow cytometry ( Fig . 3b ) . The addition of Lipofectamine LTX significantly enhanced the cellular uptake efficiency of the FITC - GALA peptide , and diffuse fluorescent signals from GALA in the cytosol and the nucleus were observed ( Fig . 3a ) . Conversely , very little cellular uptake of FITC - GALA was observed in the absence of Lipofectamine LTX ( Fig . 3a ) . Analysis using a flow cytometer showed the increased cellular uptake of FITC - GALA ( 2 μ M ) in a combined treatment with Lipofectamine LTX ( 2 % ( v / v ) ) ( ~ 12 - fold ) , and a high concentra - tion of FITC - GALA ( 10 μ M ) produced a cellular uptake efficiency similar to that of 2 μ M FITC - GALA in the presence of Lipofectamine LTX ( 2 % ( v / v ) ) ( Fig . 3b ) . The advantage of the combined treatment of GALA and Lipofectamine LTX to improve the cytosolic release of exosomal contents was also con - firmed in Fig . 3c , showing the relative cellular uptake of CD63 - GFP - exosomes with Lipofectamine LTX ( 2 % ( v / v ) ) in the presence or absence of GALA peptide ( without fluorescent label , 2 or 10 μ M ) under Figure 3 . Cellular uptake and cytosolic release of FITC - GALA in combination with cationic lipids . ( a ) Confocal microscopic observation of HeLa cells treated in combination with FITC - GALA ( 2 μ M ) and exosomes ( without expression of CD63 - GFP , 20 μ g / ml ) in the presence or absence of Lipofectamine LTX ( 2 % ( v / v ) ) for 6 h at 37 °C ( blue : Hoechst33342 , green : FITC - GALA ) .

( d ) Cytotoxicity of the combination treatment of exosomes ( 20 μ g / ml ) and Lipofectamine LTX ( 2 % ( v / v ) ) in the presence or absence of GALA ( 2 or 10 μ M ) for 24 h at 37 °C of HeLa cells analysed by a WST - 1 assay . The data are the averages ( ± SD ) of three ( b , c ) and four ( d ) experiments . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 6 Scientific RepoRts | 5 : 10112 | DOi : 10 . 1038 / srep10112 the same experimental conditions as described in Fig . 3a , analysed using a flow cytometer . The addition of the GALA peptide ( 2 μ M ) resulted in enhanced cellular uptake of CD63 - GFP - exosomes ( approxi - mately 1 . 5 - fold ) . Alternatively , the addition of 10 μ M GALA peptide decreased the cellular uptake of CD63 - GFP - exosomes , suggesting that a high concentration of the GALA peptide decreases the inter - nalisation efficiency of exosomes because the excess negative charge of the peptide might affect cellular uptake ( Fig . 3c ) . Cytotoxicity was also examined as described in Methods section , and the addition of the GALA peptide did not reduce cell viability as analysed by the WST - 1 assay ( Fig . 3d ) , suggesting that the induction of endosomal and exosomal fusion by the pH - sensitive fusogenic peptide has advantages related to cytotoxicity . The effect of FITC - GALA ( 0 . 05 , 0 . 5 or 2 . 5 μ M ) was also analysed when the concentration of exosomes ( without expression of CD63 - GFP ) was reduced to 5 μ g / ml in the combined treatment with Lipofectamine LTX ( 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) ) ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . FITC - GALA ( 0 . 5 μ M ) showed its effective diffusion into cyto - sol and nucleus ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . Conversely , no cytosolic diffusion was observed by the treat - ment with 0 . 05 or 2 . 5 μ M FITC - GALA ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . These results suggested that there should be an optimal concentration of GALA peptide for each Lipofectamine LTX concentration to achieve effective cytosolic release as previously reported by our group 20 , 21 . In contrast to this result of significant cytosolic FITC - GALA signal , CD63 - GFP - exosomes instead showed punctuate , endosome - like structures , suggesting the retention of CD63 - GFP - exosomes in endosomes or the fusion of CD63 - GFP - exosomal membranes into endosomes ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . When endosomal pH - reduction was prevented by treatment with NH 4 Cl ( 50 mM ) 20 , cytosolic diffusion of FITC - GALA peptide was significantly suppressed ( Supplementary Fig . 5c ) , suggesting that endosomal pH - reduction is essential for GALA - mediated mem - brane fusion between exosomes and endosomes to attain cytosolic release of exosomal contents . Cellular uptake of dextran - encapsulated exosomes and enhanced cytosolic release by cat - ionic lipids and GALA peptide . Next , we examined the cytosolic delivery of cargo - encapsulated exosomes using the combined treatment consisting of the cationic lipids and the GALA peptide . Dextran ( 70 kDa ) was adopted as a model macromolecular cargo in this experiment . It is difficult for dextran to penetrate through the cell membrane by itself . We used Texas red - labelled dextran ( TR - dex ) to visualise the intracellular localisation of encapsulated dextran in exosomes delivered using the combined treat - ment with the cationic lipids and the GALA peptide . We used an optimized electroporation condition to encapsulate TR - dex into exosomes as described in the Methods section . After the cargo - loading via electroporation , removal of unencapsulated TR - dex was conducted by repeatedly washing with PBS and filtration with centrifugal filters . HeLa cells were treated with TR - dex - encapsulated exosomes ( exosome : 20 μ g / ml , encapsulated TR - dex : 150 ng / ml ) in combination with Lipofectamine LTX ( 2 % ( v / v ) ) in α - MEM containing 10 % FBS for 24 h at 37 °C , prior to analysis using a confocal microscope . Significantly increased cellular uptake of TR - dex - encapsulated exosomes was observed upon the addition of Lipofectamine LTX ( Fig . 4a ) . Analysis using a flow cytometer showed increased cellular uptake of FITC - dextran ( FITC - dex ) - encapsulated exosomes ( exosome : 20 μ g / ml , encapsulated FITC - dex : 100 ng / ml ) ( approximately 3 . 6 - fold ) in combi - nation with Lipofectamine LTX ( 2 % ( v / v ) ) ( Fig . 4b ) . Furthermore , HeLa cells were treated with TR - dex encapsulated exosomes ( exosome : 20 μ g / ml , encapsulated TR - dextran : 150 ng / ml ) in combination with Lipofectamine LTX ( 2 % ( v / v ) ) and FITC - GALA ( 2 μ M ) in α - MEM containing 10 % FBS for 6 h at 37 °C , prior to analysis using confocal microscope . Diffuse fluorescent signals of TR - dextran were observed in the cytosol in approximately 60 % of the cells , which were accompanied by the cytosolic release of FITC - GALA ( Fig . 4c ) . Conversely , in the absence of Lipofectamine LTX , the cellular uptake of FITC - GALA was difficult to observe , and only endosome - like punctuate signals of TR - dex were noted in the cells ( Fig . 4c ) . In addition , significant cytosolic release of TR - dex was observed even when a lower concentration of TR - dex - encapsulated exosomes ( exosome : 5 μ g / ml , encapsulated TR - dex : 38 ng / ml ) was employed in the presence of Lipofectamine LTX ( 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) ) and FITC - GALA ( 0 . 5 μ M ) ( Supplementary Fig . 5d ) . Prevention of endosomal pH - reduction by NH 4 Cl ( 50 mM ) decreased cytosolic release effi - cacy of TR - dex ( Supplementary Fig . 5d ) , suggesting that pH - reduction in endosomes is essential for membrane fusion of exosomes with endosomes in the presence of the GALA peptide and the even - tual cytosolic release of FITC - GALA and exosomal contents . We also examined the cytosolic release of dextran - encapsulated exosomes in CHO - K1 cells ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . In the case of the CHO - K1 cells , the addition of Lipofectamine LTX ( 2 % ( v / v ) ) and FITC - GALA ( 2 μ M ) enhanced the cytosolic release of TR - dextran similar to that in HeLa cells ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . Conversely , an increase in FITC - GALA concentration ( 10 μ M ) diminished cytosolic release of TR - dex ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . In addition , when HeLa cells were treated with TR - dex ( 150 ng / ml ) without encapsulation in exosomes under the same experimental conditions as in Fig . 4c , analysis using a confocal microscope showed that it was difficult to observe the cellular localisation of TR - dex . This difficulty occurred due to the low level of fluorescence intensity of the TR - dex signals in the cells , suggesting that encapsulation in exosomes significantly enhances the cellular uptake of dextran . Intracellular delivery of saporin - encapsulated exosomes with combined treatment of cationic lipids and GALA peptide . The delivery of saporin ( approximately 30 kDa ) into cells using exosomes and their biological activities were also analysed in Fig . 5 to assess the effects of the combination treatment www . nature . com / scientificreports / 7 Scientific RepoRts | 5 : 10112 | DOi : 10 . 1038 / srep10112 on cytosolic delivery systems . Saporin is a ribosome - inactivating protein that inhibits protein synthesis and the growth of targeted cells 28 . In this study , saporin - encapsulated exosomes were prepared , and the induction of cell death by the combined treatment with the cationic lipids and the GALA peptide was detected . Saporin was encapsulated in exosomes by electroporation under the same experimental condi - tions as dextran in Fig . 4 , and the removal of unencapsulated saporin was conducted using repeated cen - trifugal filtration as described in the Methods section . HeLa cells were treated with saporin - encapsulated exosomes ( 20 μ g / ml ) with the combined treatment with Lipofectamine LTX ( 2 % ( v / v ) ) and GALA pep - tide ( 2 μ M ) . After the treatment for 24 hr , the morphology of the HeLa cells treated with the test sam - ples was observed using a microscope , and cell viability was also assessed by the WST - 1 assay ( Fig . 5 ) .

Scale bar : 10 μ m . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 8 Scientific RepoRts | 5 : 10112 | DOi : 10 . 1038 / srep10112 Figure 5a shows a microscopic observation of the treated cells , and morphological changes in the HeLa cells were significantly induced by the combined treatment of saporin - encapsulated exosomes with Lipofectamine LTX and GALA peptide . Conversely , saporin - encapsulated exosomes without GALA pep - tide also induced morphological changes in the cells ; however , their effects were observed to be weaker in comparison to the combined treatment with Lipofectamine LTX and GALA peptide ( Fig . 5a ) . The effects of saporin - encapsulated exosome ( 20 μ g / ml ) treatment alone on cell morphology were difficult to observe ( Fig . 5a ) . In the WST - 1 assay for cytotoxicity , the combined treatment of saporin - encapsulated exosomes with Lipofectamine LTX and GALA peptide resulted in the highest induction of cell death ( approximately 98 % ) in comparison to other treatment methods in this experiment ( Fig . 5b ) . Thus , our simple combined method successfully demonstrated the effective intracellular delivery of saporin and consequent biological activity in cells by artificial encapsulation of the protein into exosomes . Discussion Endocytosis has been shown to be a major pathway for the cellular uptake of exosomes for cell - to - cell communication and their use in drug delivery 6 – 9 . Live - cell microscopic imaging indicated that exosomes were taken up by cells via an endocytosis pathway by becoming trapped in vesicles and transported to lysosomes 8 . The binding of exosomes to the surface of a recipient cell involves the interaction of the exo - somal membrane molecules and cellular receptors , including intracellular adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM1 ) , lymphocyte function - associated antigen 1 ( LFA1 ) , phosphatidylserine binding to T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain protein 1 ( TIM1 ) or TIM4 7 . Svensson and coworkers also reported that the cellular uptake of exosomes was dependent on extracellular signal - regulated kinase - 1 / 2 ( ERK1 / 2 ) and heat shock protein 27 ( HSP27 ) signalling , and ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation was negatively influenced by Figure 5 . Combined treatment of saporin - encapsulated exosomes with cationic lipids and GALA peptide effectively induces cytotoxicity .

( b ) Cytotoxicity of HeLa cells treated with saporin - encapsulated exosomes ( 20 μ g / ml ) or exosomes ( 20 μ g / ml ) without saporin in the combination treatment of Lipofectamine LTX and GALA peptide under the same experimental conditions as ( a ) , analysed by the WST - 1 assay . The data are the averages ( ± SD ) of three experiments . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 9 Scientific RepoRts | 5 : 10112 | DOi : 10 . 1038 / srep10112 caveolin - 1 during internalisation of exosomes 9 . However , complicated cellular uptake mechanisms are still under debate . Both endosomal and exosomal membranes consist of a lipid bilayer , and the exosomal contents need to penetrate the lipid layers , which are barriers against their cytosolic release and their achievement of intracellular bioactivities . Because a high number of exosomes exists in human body fluids ( e . g . , blood , saliva , urine ) , there is also intense competition for the cellular uptake of exosomes . Parolini reported that the membrane fusion of exosomes was influenced by low pH , and acidity in melanoma cells was involved in exosomal release and cellular uptake by fusion with cell mem - branes 29 . The report also showed that biophysical analysis of membrane parameters such as flu - idity and lipid composition indicated high rigidity and that sphingomyelin / ganglioside GM3 ( N - acetylneuraminylgalactosylglucosylceramide ) in exosomes is released at low pH 29 . However , our research showed that the release of TR - dex from the exosomes to the cytosol was difficult as shown in Fig . 4c . Differences in membrane composition in each exosome may affect the cellular uptake and mem - brane fusion due to pH - sensitivity ; however , further studies on cellular uptake and membrane fusion mechanisms in exosomes are necessary . Considering the research results , the development of experimen - tal techniques for the effective release of exosomal contents ( e . g . , genes and proteins ) through endosomal and exosomal membranes should be required for bioactivity to occur inside cells before the degradation of the exosomal contents in the endosomal maturation pathway . Recently , exosomal contents secreted from disease - related cells have been studied to understand their biological functions in cell - to - cell communication and disease progress 1 – 3 . However , experimental trials using exosomes usually take a long time to detect cellular responses because of the competitive cellular uptake of exosomes and the low cytosolic release of exosomal contents . Therefore , regarding the research objectives of drug delivery and the biological elucidation of exosomal functions , development of cytosolic release techniques is essential for understanding their biology . In this study , we adopted Lipofectamine LTX as a model cationic lipid for an in vitro assay for the enhancement of exosomal cellular uptake . Other types of functional cationic materials , including biocompatible and biodegradable polymers , might be applicable to our method as well , possibly opening further avenues for in vivo applications . Cytosolic release from endosomes by the disruption of the endosomal membrane is considered rea - sonable to attain lower cytotoxicity in comparison to the disruption of plasma membranes . Because almost all enzymes for molecular digestion ( e . g . , of genes , proteins , sugars ) show biological activity at low pH ( i . e . , lysosomes ) , enzymes released into the cytosol show little activity 30 . Therefore , the cytosolic release of enzymes induced by endosomal disruption causes little damage in the cytosol ( pH of approx - imately 7 . 2 ) , resulting in little cytotoxicity . To enhance endosomal disruption , a pH - sensitive fusogenic peptide , GALA , was adopted in this research to accelerate the cytosolic release of exosomal and endoso - mal contents by the fusion of these membranes . GALA peptides have been applied to endosomal release , especially in gene transfection 31 – 35 . Our research group also successfully achieved the cytosolic delivery of peptides and proteins using the GALA peptide in a combined treatment with cationic lipids 20 , 21 . The GALA peptide was designed to mimic viral fusion protein sequences that interact with cell membranes to mediate the escape of the viral genes from acidic endosomes . Glutamic acid residues in the peptide provide a pH - dependent negatively charged side - chain , and the repeat sequence Glu - Ala - Leu - Ala has a hydrophobic face to interact with membranes when the peptide forms an α - helix . The GALA peptide converts to an amphipathic α - helix when the pH is reduced from 7 . 5 to 5 . 0 , and the peptide shows a high affinity to neutral and negatively charged membranes . GALA induces fusion between small unilamellar vesicles composed of unsaturated phos - pholipids , and the peptide was shown to possibly form a transmembrane peptide - based pore composed of approximately ten α - helical monomers 36 – 38 . GALA peptide has been used as an additive to improve transfection efficiency and to enhance the escape of nucleic acids from endosomes . We adopted the GALA peptide to enhance the cytosolic release of exosomal contents in a combined treatment with cationic lipids . Effective cellular uptake of FITC - GALA was observed in this treatment method , and the cytosolic release of the peptide was observed even in the presence of exosomes ( Fig . 3a ) , suggesting the high possibility that the GALA peptide could be effectively used for membrane fusion in an exosomal delivery system . However , the cellular uptake efficiency for exosomes was decreased by a high concentration of the GALA peptide ( Fig . 3c ) . This result is similar to our previous reports on protein delivery because charges on the peptide and cationic lipids affect their cellular uptake and mem - brane fusion 20 , 21 . In Supplementary Figs . 4a and 5a , concentrations of exosomes , Lipofectamine LTX , and FITC - GALA affect their cellular uptake efficiency and cytosolic release . Therefore , an optimal com - bined treatment using cationic lipids and the GALA peptide is important to attain an effective balance of internalisation and cytosolic release . Additionally , excess volumes of cationic lipids induce substantial cytotoxicity ( Fig . 2d and Supplementary Fig . 4b ) , and an optimal balance of cellular uptake efficiency and cytotoxicity in the combined treatment of exosomes should be considered . In Fig . 4 , we demonstrated the effective intracellular delivery of fluorescently labelled dextran by encapsulation into exosomes and cytosolic release of the exosomal contents . As described in the Methods section , the poring pulse electroporation method affects encapsulation efficacy . Therefore , optimization of the method is needed to attain efficient encapsulation of objective molecules in exosomes . Conversely , the same concentration of dextran unencapsulated in exosomes showed a much lower cellular uptake ( approximately 130 - fold ) than that of encapsulated dextran , suggesting that encapsulation of the dextran enhanced cellular uptake . Encapsulation of the dextran in exosomes may make changes of the original www . nature . com / scientificreports / 10 Scientific RepoRts | 5 : 10112 | DOi : 10 . 1038 / srep10112 cellular uptake pathways of dextran , and warping with exosomal membranes takes advantage of compul - sory internalisation by cells through exosomal cellular uptake pathways . In addition , we also successfully achieved enhancement of the biological activity of encapsulated saporin by the combined treatment with cationic lipids and the GALA peptide ( Fig . 5 ) . Both the cationic lipids and the GALA peptide are essential for enhanced saporin activity in the induction of effective cell death resulting from treatment with saporin - encapsulated exosomes . However , in an assessment using TR - dex - encapsulated exosomes with our current method , the cytosolic release of TR - dextran from exosomes that were treated with the cationic lipids and the GALA peptide was observed in only approx - imately 60 % of the cells . Improvement of the efficiency of the cytosolic release of the exosomal contents without cytotoxicity is a future research objective . In conclusion , we used a simple methodology for the enhanced cellular uptake of exosomes and the efficient cytosolic release of encapsulated cargo by exosomes via the formation of a complex with cationic lipids and a pH - sensitive fusogenic peptide . Although further studies are needed for a more advanced and sophisticated development of cellular uptake and cytosolic release technology in exosomes , our method using the combined treatment will greatly contribute to many biological , pharmaceutical , and medical research fields , including the assessment of unknown activities of exosomal contents ( e . g . , bio - active proteins and genes ) derived from disease - related cells . It will also contribute to the development of tools enabling intracellular visualisation and cellular regulation for future therapeutic applications . Methods Peptide synthesis and fluorescence labelling . The pH - sensitive fusogenic peptide , GALA ( amino acid sequence : WEAALAEALAEALAEHLAEALAEALEALAA - amide ) , was chemically synthesised by 9 - fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl solid - phase peptide synthesis on Rink amide resin as described previ - ously 20 , 21 . Amino acid derivatives and the Rink amide resin were purchased from the Peptide Institute ( Osaka , Japan ) and Shimadzu Biotech ( Kyoto , Japan ) . Deprotection of the peptide and cleavage from the resin were conducted via treatment with a trifluoroacetic acid / ethanedithiol mixture ( 95 : 5 ) at room temperature for 3 h , followed by reverse - phase high - performance liquid chromatographic ( HPLC ) purifi - cation . For preparation of the fluorescently - labelled peptides , a 4 - aminobutanoic acid residue was intro - duced at the N - terminus of the peptide , and fluorescence - labelling was conducted by treatment with 3 equivalents of fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) isomer I ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) in N , N - diisopropylethylamine ( 3 equivalents ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in N , N - dimethylformamide for 6 h at room temperature on the resin . The structures of the synthesised peptides were confirmed by matrix - assisted laser desorption ionisation time - of - flight mass spectrometry ( MALDI - TOFMS ) ( Microflex , Bruker , Billerica , MA , USA ) . Cell culture . HeLa ( human cervical cancer - derived ) cells were purchased from the Riken BRC Cell Bank ( Ibaraki , Japan ) . Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) - K1 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection ( Manassas , VA , USA ) . Each cell was cultured in α - MEM ( Gibco , Life Technologies Corporation , Grand Island , NY , USA ) and F - 12 nutrient mixture ( Ham’s F - 12 ) ( CHO - K1 ) ( Gibco , Life Technologies Corporation ) containing 10 % heat - inactivated FBS ( Gibco , Life Technologies Corporation ) . Cells were grown on 100 mm dishes and incubated at 37 °C under 5 % CO 2 . Preparation of HeLa cells stably expressing green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - fused CD63 . Tetraspanin CD63 is a membrane marker protein of exosomes , and we prepared HeLa cells stably expressing GFP - fused CD63 to secrete CD63 - GFP - containing exosomes ( CD63 - GFP - exosomes ) . The cells ( 1 × 10 5 cells ) were plated on a 24 well microplate ( Iwaki , Tokyo , Japan ) and incubated for 1 day . They were transfected with CD63 - GFP plasmid ( pCT - CD63 - GFP , pCMV , Cyto - Tracer , System Biosciences , Mountain View , CA ) ( 800 ng ) complexed with Lipofectamine LTX reagent ( 2 μ l ) with PLUS reagent ( 1 μ l ) ( Invitrogen , Life Technologies Corporation ) in α - MEM containing 10 % FBS ( 200 μ l ) . The cells were also treated with puromycin ( 3 μ g / ml ) ( LKT Laboratories , St . Paul , MN ) for the antibiotic selection of HeLa cells stably expressing CD63 - GFP ( CD63 - GFP - HeLa ) . Isolation of exosomes . CD63 - GFP - HeLa cells ( 3 × 10 6 cells ) were seeded on 100 mm dishes in α - MEM containing 10 % exosome - free FBS ( EXO - FBS , ATLAS biological , Fort Collins , CO , USA ) for 3 days . The cell culture medium was collected , and secreted exosomes were isolated by Total Exosome Isolation ( from cell culture media ) ( Invitrogen , Austin , TX , USA ) . The concentrations of isolated exosomes were described in terms of their protein concentrations , which were determined using a Pierce BCA protein assay kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc . , Rockford , IL , USA ) . Isolation of exosomes was conducted using ultracentrifugation 39 . The collected cell culture medium was centrifuged ( 300 × g ) for 10 min at 4 °C . The supernatant was centrifuged ( 2 , 000 × g ) for 10 min at 4 °C and again centrifuged ( 10 , 000 × g ) for 30 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris . The supernatant was then centrifuged ( 100 , 000 × g ) for 30 min at 4 °C using an ultracentrifuge ( Himac CP65 β , Hitachi , Tokyo , Japan ) in duplicate , and the pellet was collected in PBS . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 11 Scientific RepoRts | 5 : 10112 | DOi : 10 . 1038 / srep10112 Western blot analysis . Isolated exosomes were added to lysis buffer ( 62 . 5 mM Tris - HCl ( pH = 6 . 8 ) , 2 % SDS , 10 % glycerol , 0 . 002 % bromlopheno blue , 5 % 2 - mercaptoethanol ) . The boiled samples were sep - arated by 10 % SDS - PAGE , transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride ( PVDF ) membranes ( GE Healthcare , Pittsburgh , PA , USA ) , and treated with anti - CD63 antibody ( TS63 , Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) , anti - GFP antibody ( ab290 , Abcam ) and anti - CD9 antibody ( EPR2949 , Abcam ) . A secondary antibody labelled with horseradish peroxidase ( anti - rabbit IgG HRP - linked whole antibody donkey , GE Healthcare ) was used , and immunoreactive species were detected by an Enhanced Chemiluminescence ( ECL ) Plus Western Blotting Detection System ( GE Healthcare ) . Immunoreactive species were detected at a position of approximately 50 kDa in SDS - PAGE analysis using anti - CD63 and anti - GFP antibodies . Complex of exosomes with cationic lipids and GALA peptide . Lipofectamine LTX diluted with α - MEM ( total 20 μ l ) was added to a solution of exosomes and the GALA peptide in α - MEM ( total 20 μ l ) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature . The mixture was then added to heat - inactivated FBS ( 20 μ l ) and serum - free α - MEM ( 140 μ l ) , prior to cellular uptake assays . Confocal microscopy . Cells ( 2 × 10 5 cells , 2 ml ) were plated on a 35 mm glass dish ( Iwaki , Tokyo , Japan ) and incubated in cell culture medium ( HeLa cells , α - MEM ; CHO - K1 cells , Ham’s F - 12 ) contain - ing 10 % FBS for 24 h at 37 °C under 5 % CO 2 . After complete adhesion , the cells were washed with cell culture medium containing 10 % FBS and treated with exosomal samples ( 200 μ l / well ) . The cells were then washed with fresh cell culture medium and analysed using a FV1200 confocal laser scanning micro - scope ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) equipped with a × 40 objective . To stain endosomes , HeLa cells were pre - stained with DiD ( Invitrogen , 2 . 5 % ( v / v ) ) in 10 % FBS containing α - MEM ( 200 μ l / well ) at 4 °C for 5 min . The cells were then washed with fresh cell culture medium , and treated with CD63 - GFP - exosomes ( 20 μ g / ml ) with the combined treatment with Lipofectamine LTX ( 2 % ( v / v ) ) at 37 °C for 6 h , prior to observation by confocal microscope . To prevent endosomal pH - reduction , NH 4 Cl ( 50 mM ) was added in exosomal samples as previously reported . 20 Flow cytometer . Cells ( 4 . 7 × 10 4 cells , 1 ml ) were plated on a 24 well microplate ( Iwaki ) and incu - bated in cell culture medium ( HeLa cells , α - MEM ; CHO - K1 cells , Ham’s F - 12 ) containing 10 % FBS for 24 h at 37 °C under 5 % CO 2 . After complete adhesion , the cells were washed with cell culture medium containing 10 % FBS and treated with exosomal samples ( 200 μ l / well ) , prior to washing with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) ( triple washing , 200 μ l ) . The cells were then treated with 0 . 01 % trypsin at 37 °C for 10 min , prior to the addition of PBS ( 200 μ l ) , and centrifuged at 3 , 000 rpm ( 800 × g ) for 3 min at 4 °C . After removal of the supernatant , the cells were washed with PBS ( 400 μ l ) and centrifuged at 3 , 000 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C . This washing cycle was repeated , and the cells were suspended in PBS ( 400 μ l ) and sub - jected to fluorescence analysis on a guava easyCyte ( Merck Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) flow cytom - eter using 488 nm laser excitation and a 525 nm emission filter . Living cells ( 10 , 000 cells / sample ) for the detection of cellular fluorescence intensity were counted based on forward scatter and side scatter analyses . Electron microscope and zeta - potential . Suspended exosomes in PBS ( 30 μ g / ml ) were dropped on a carbon - coated grid ( 400 mesh ) and washed with distilled water . Uranil acetate was applied to the grid and left for 10 sec at room temperature . Then , the reagent was removed with filter paper and dried , prior to imaging with a transmission electron microscope ( TEM ) ( JEM1200EX , JEOL , Tokyo , Japan ) . The zeta - potential of the exosomes diluted in PBS ( 25 μ g / ml ) was determined using a zeta - potential analyser ELSZ - DN2 ( Otsuka electronics , Osaka , Japan ) according the manufacturer’s instructions . Preparation of FITC - labelled saporin . Two hundred microgram of saporin ( saporin from Saponaria officinalis seeds , Sigma - Aldrich ) dissolved in H 2 O ( 100 μ l ) was reacted with 2 equivalents of FITC ( Sigma - Aldrich ) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide ( 10 μ l ) and N , N - diisopropylethylamine ( 0 . 5 μ l ) at 30 °C for 2 h . For the removal of unreacted FITC , gel filtration on a Sephadex G - 25 column ( PD - 10 , GE Healthcare ) was conducted prior to lyophilisation . The protein concentration was determined using a Pierce BCA protein assay kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc . ) . Encapsulation of fluorescently - labelled dextran and saporin into exosomes . To load fluorescently - labelled dextran in exosomes , exosomes ( 25 μ g ) were mixed with Texas red - labelled dextran ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR , USA ) , FITC - labelled dextran ( 70 kDa ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , or saporin ( 50 μ g ) in PBS ( 100 μ l ) . After electroporation ( poring pulse : twice pulse ( 5 msec ) , transfer pulse : five pulse ( 20 V , 50 msec ) ) in a 1 cm electroporation cuvette at room temperature using a super elec - tropolater NEPA21 TypeII ( NEPA genes , Tokyo , Japan ) , removal of unencapsulated Texas red - dextran , FITC - dextran , or saporin was accomplished by washing and filtration using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters ( 100K device , Merck Millipore ) . Texas red - dextran and FITC - dextran loaded in exosomes were confirmed using a spectrofluometer ( FP - 6200 , JASCO , Tokyo , Japan ) . The electroporation method was optimized for poring pulse ( 100 , 200 , 300 V ) , resulting in encapsulation of Texas red - dextran ( 80 , 150 , 110 ng / ml ) in 20 μ g / ml of exosomes , respectively . Therefore , we used an experimental poring pulse of 200 V in the electroporation steps . The efficiency of dextran encapsulation into exosomes was calculated www . nature . com / scientificreports / 12 Scientific RepoRts | 5 : 10112 | DOi : 10 . 1038 / srep10112 to be 0 . 4 % . The concentration of saporin encapsulated in 20 μ g / ml exosomes was estimated to be around 180 ng / ml using the FITC - labelled saporin . The efficiency of saporin encapsulation into exosomes was calculated to be 0 . 5 % . Cell viability ( WST - 1 assay ) . Cell viability was analysed by a WST - 1 ( 4 - [ 3 - ( 4 - iodophenyl ) - 2 - ( 4 - nitrophenyl ) - 2H - 5 - tetrazolio ] - 1 , 3 - benzene disulfonate ) assay as previously described 40 . Cells ( 1 × 10 4 cells , 100 μ l ) were incubated in 96 well microplates in cell culture medium ( HeLa cells , α - MEM ; CHO - K1 cells , Ham’s F - 12 ) containing 10 % FBS for 24 h at 37 °C under 5 % CO 2 . The cells were then treated with exosomal samples ( 50 μ l ) for 24 h at 37 °C under 5 % CO 2 . After the sample treatment , WST - 1 reagents ( 10 μ l ) were added to each well , and the samples were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C . Absorbencies at 450 nm ( A 450 ) and 620 nm ( A 620 ) were measured , and the value obtained by subtracting A 620 from A 450 corresponded to the viable cell number . References 1 .
