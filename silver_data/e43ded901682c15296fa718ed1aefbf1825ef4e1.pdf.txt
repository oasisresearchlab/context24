Introduction Mammalian spermatogenesis involves an intricate progres - sion of cell division and diﬀerentiation leading to the forma - tion of mature spermatozoa , whereby some crucial genes are expressed under stringent temporal and spatial regulation . Identiﬁcation and characterization of these diﬀerentially ex - pressed genes will be of great value in delineating the mecha - nism of spermatogenesis . In the present study , the method of diﬀerential display polymerase chain reaction ( DDRT - PCR ) combined with segmentation of rat seminiferous tubules was applied to investigate the diﬀerential gene expression in germ cells at diﬀerent stages of spermatogenesis [ 1 ] . One of the expressed sequence tags ( ESTs ) was isolated and used as probe in screening a cDNA library of rat testis , whereby a full - length cDNA ( GenBank Accession No . AF154849 ) was identiﬁed . The encoded protein contains the conserved J domain in the N - terminal region thus was designated as rDJL - a novel mem - ber of the DnaJ protein family . It is well established that DnaJ proteins serve as co - chaper - ones to Hsp70 proteins [ 2 ] and are required for the stimulation of interacting Hsp70 ATPase activity [ 3 , 4 ] . DnaJ proteins are involved in a variety of processes such as protein folding [ 5 ] , protein traﬃcking [ 6 , 7 ] , signal transduction [ 8 ] , regulation of gene expression [ 9 ] , uncoating of clathrin - coated vesicles [ 10 ] , and so on . To date several DnaJ proteins involved with sper - matogenesis have been identiﬁed . MSJ - 1 is a DnaJ homolog speciﬁcally expressed in germ cells during the haploid stages , and interacts with mUBPy . It may be important for acrosome formation and centrosome adjustment during spermatid devel - opment [ 11 , 12 ] . Studies on the role of DjA1 , a type I DnaJ homolog , revealed that deletion of this gene in mice led to se - vere defects in spermatogenesis , involving aberrant androgen signaling [ 13 ] . To characterize rDJL , the transcripts of this gene in multiple tissues and testes in developing at varying postnatal days were determined by quantitative real - time PCR and Northern blot assay . The highest level of rDJL transcripts were found in rat testis , and the earliest evidence of expression occurred in testis on the 30th postnatal day , which reached adult level on the 60th postnatal day . Immunoﬂuorescent studies revealed that the protein was localized in the acrosomal region of sper - matozoa . Immunoprecipitation experiments conﬁrmed that rDJL interacts with Hsc70 and clathrin protein . Evidence will be presented showing that rDJL functions as co - chaperone to Hsc70 and participates in vesicular traﬃcking , thus may be important for acrosome formation during spermiogenesis . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Diﬀerential display of mRNA and screening of the rat testis cDNA library The cycle of rat seminiferous epithelium can be divided into 14 stages [ 14 , 15 ] and each stage represents a diﬀerent combination of germ cell status , including spermatogonia , spermatocytes , spermatids and spermatozoa . Based on the morphological features of these germ cells , the stages in the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium can be delin - eated by transillumination and seminiferous tubule divided into four segments of stages II – VI , VII – VIII , IX – XII and XIII – I . In this re - search , two segments of rat seminiferous tubule in stages IX – XII and XIII – I were isolated under a dissecting microscope , delineated by the use of diﬀerential diopters .

[ 16 ] using 200 l g total RNA from each prep - aration . cDNA ( 1 l l ) was added to the PCR mixture containing [ a - 35S ] deoxyadenosine triphosphate ( 10 mCi / ml ; Amersham ) , 10 - mer deoxyoligonucleotide random 5 0 primer , 3 0 - oligo dT 12 N ( N is A , C , or G ) single - anchored primer . The radiolabeled DNA fragments were electrophoresed in 6 % denaturing polyacrylamide gels , and after dry - ing , the gels were exposed to X - ray ﬁlms . Diﬀerentially expressed cDNAs were cut from the dried gels and incubated in 50 l l ddH 2 O and the DNA extracted by boiling . The isolated cDNAs were reampliﬁed and the products denatured and dotted onto two identical nylon membranes with equal amount and in the same array pattern . The membranes were hybridized with radiolabeled cDNA probes prepared with total RNAs from the two segments of seminiferous tubule , respectively . Hybridization was per - formed at 65 (cid:2) C for 30 h in hybridization solution ( 1 mM EDTA , 7 % sodium dodecyl sulfate , 0 . 5 M Na 2 HPO 4 , pH 7 . 2 ) . The membranes were washed twice with 2 · sodium saline citrate at room temperature , each for 15 min , then washed at 37 (cid:2) C for 30 min and at 65 (cid:2) C for 30 min . Autoradiography was performed at (cid:1) 70 (cid:2) C . Those cDNA fragments , whose expression diﬀerences had been conﬁrmed by reverse dot - blot hybridization were cloned into pUC19 plasmid and sequenced and submitted to GenBank as ESTs . One of the ESTs derived from diﬀerential displayed mRNA of frag - mentation of seminiferous tubule ( GenBank Accession No . AF059656 ) was used as probe in screening a rat testis k gt10 5 0 - stretch cDNA li - brary ( Clontech , CA ) . A total of 1 · 10 6 clones were screened with the plaque hybridization method . Positive clones were selected and the inserts ampliﬁed , using the primers of the ﬂank sequence of phage vectors . The ampliﬁed products were cloned into pGEM - T Easy vector ( Promega ) , sequenced using the ABI 377 autosequencer . The sequence was deposited with GenBank . 2 . 2 . Northern blot and real - time PCR assay Tissues of brain , heart , intestine , kidney , liver , lung , muscle , spleen and testis were dissected from adult male rats , frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately , and stored at (cid:1) 80 (cid:2) C . In the developmental studies , testes were collected from male rats at days 7 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 80 and 120 of neonatal life . Total RNAs were prepared , using the Trizol reagent ( Invitrogen ) . In the Northern blot analysis , 20 l g of each sample was subjected to electrophoresis on a 1 % agarose / formaldehyde gel and transferred onto a positively charged nylon membrane ( Boehringer Mannheim ) . Radiolabeled cDNA probes were prepared using [ a - 32 P ] deoxycytidine triphosphate . Autoradiography was performed to visualize the compo - nent showing positive hybridization with the probe . Blots were stripped and reprobed for b - actin . Quantitative real - time PCR analysis was performed on 2 l g of total RNA from each species of rat tissue which was used for the ﬁrst - strand cDNA synthesis utilizing the SuperScript First - strand Synthesis Sys - tem ( Invitrogen ) . The real - time PCR reaction was performed in a vol - ume of 20 l l containing oligonucleotide primers ( 5 l M each ) , and SYBR Green PCR Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems ) containing Taq DNA Polymerase , the reaction buﬀer , dNTP and the double strand DNA - speciﬁc ﬂuorescent dye SYBR Green . Ampliﬁcation was per - formed as a two - step procedure : denaturation at 95 (cid:2) C for 10 min and 40 cycles with denaturation at 95 (cid:2) C for 15 s , annealing and elon - gation at 60 (cid:2) C for 1 min . The ﬂuorescent signal from the samples was measured at the end of the elongation step . The sequences of the prim - ers for rDJL were : forward ; 5 0 - TTT CCA TCA ATT TCC AAC CAC G - 3 0 , and reverse ; 5 0 - ACT CTG AAG CCT TTG TGC CGT - 3 0 ; The sequences of the primers for rat b - actin were : forward ; 5 0 - TGG AAT CCT GTG GCA TCC ATG AAA C - 3 0 , and reverse ; 5 0 - TAA AAC GCA GCT CAG TAA CAG TCC G - 3 0 . 2 . 3 . Preparation , puriﬁcation of recombinant protein and raising of anti - rDJL antiserum An rDJL cDNA fragment , encoding essentially the C - terminal por - tion of rDJL protein ( aa 82 – 223 ) was cloned in frame with glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) using the pGEX - 4T - 3 vector . The recombinant GST - rDJL ( 82 – 223 ) protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) and puriﬁed by chromatography on Glutathione Sepharose 4B ( Amersham Biosciences ) according to standard procedures . The purity of the fusion proteins was judged by SDS – PAGE and Coomassie blue - staining . The protein concentration was assessed by comparison with BSA standards using BCA (cid:3) Protein Assay ( Pierce ) . New Zealand rabbits were immunized with GST - rDJL ( 82 – 223 ) protein to raise polyclonal antibodies . Antibody titer of the anti - rDJL antise - rum was determined by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . To establish the speciﬁcity of the antiserum , Western blot assay was carried out by testing puriﬁed protein samples of GST - rDJL ( 82 – 223 ) and rat testis extract with the antiserum and preimmunized serum . 2 . 4 . Immunohistochemical localization Cryostat frozen rat testis sections of 5 l m - thick were prepared and processed according to the manufacturer (cid:1) s instruction ( Zymed Histos - pain - SP , MT Rabbit ACE kit , Zymed Lab . Inc . South San Francisco ) . After blocking with 5 % BSA in 3 % H 2 O 2 / PBS buﬀer , the testis sections were incubated with anti - rDJL antibody ( 1 : 1000 dilution in PBS / 5 % BSA ) , or with preimmune serum ( 1 : 1000 dilution in PBS / 5 % BSA ) as negative control for 1 h at room temperature . After washing three times with PBS buﬀer , all slides were incubated with biotin - labeled anti - rabbit IgG antibody at 37 (cid:2) C for 30 min and then incubated with Streptavidin - coupled horseradish peroxidase at 37 (cid:2) C for 30 min . Sec - tions were washed with PBS , incubated with AEC detection buﬀer ( 4 mg AEC dissolved in 1 ml dimethyl formamide and 14 ml of 0 . 1 M sodium acetate , pH 5 . 2 , with 15 l l of H 2 O 2 ) , and counterstained with Mayer (cid:1) s haematoxylin and examined by light microscopy . 2 . 5 . Cyto - immunoﬂuorescent localization The separation of germ cells was performed as previously reported [ 17 ] . Isolated spermatogenic cells were smeared onto microscope slides and ﬁxed with paraformaldehyde ﬁxative . The slides were washed three times in PBS and the cells were permeabilized by treatment with 0 . 5 % Triton in PBS for 10 min . The slides were washed three times with PBS and blocked by incubating in PBS containing 3 % bovine ser - um albumin for 15 min . For the detection of rDJL , the cells were incu - bated ﬁrst with rabbit antiserum against rDJL , then incubated with FITC - labeled goat antibody against rabbit IgG and ﬁnally counter - stained with Hoechst 33258 . The slides were examined under confocal microscope . 2 . 6 . Co - immunoprecipitation assay The coding region of rDJL was subcloned into pcDNA6 / V5 - HisB - HA vector ( HA tag sequence inserted into pcDNA6 / V5 - HisB vector between NheI and HindIII sites ) . HEK293 cells were transiently trans - fected with pcDNA6 / V5 - HisB - HA - rDJL and pEGFP - C3 - clathrin expression vectors ( kindly provided by Dr . Lois E . Greene , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) [ 18 ] . Lipofect AMINE (cid:3) was used according to the manufacturer (cid:1) s instructions ( Invitrogen , CA ) . Cells were lysed in EBC ( 50 mM Tris – HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 120 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 % NP40 , 50 mM NaF , 50 l g / ml PMSF , 10 l g / ml aprotinin and leupep - tin ) . Whole cell extracts were incubated with anti - HA monoclonal anti - body ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) . Protein A agarose beads ( 40 l l ) were added and the mixture incubated and rotated overnight at 4 (cid:2) C . The beads were washed with NETN ( 20 mM Tris – Cl , pH 8 . 0 , 100 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 % NP40 , and 1 mM EDTA ) . The proteins were col - lected , resuspended in SDS – PAGE sample buﬀer , and subjected to SDS – PAGE and Western blot using anti - HSC70 antibody or anti - GFP antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) . 2 . 7 . Localization examination of rDJL and clathrin protein in CHO cells The coding region of rDJL was subcloned into pDsRed1 - N1 vector . CHO cells were transiently transfected with pDsRed1 - N1 - rDJL and pEGFP - C3 - clathrin and grown on coverslips . Thirty - six hours after post - transfection , cells were treated with 100 nM epidermal growth factor ( CytoLab ) for 15 min at 37 (cid:2) C . After stimulation , the cells were ﬁxed with 4 % formaldehyde , and then visualized by confocal microscopy . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Isolation and identiﬁcation of rDJL gene The full - length cDNA of rDJL was isolated by screening a rat testis cDNA library , sequenced and was assigned the C . Yang et al . / FEBS Letters 579 ( 2005 ) 5734 – 5740 5735 GenBank Accession No . AF154849 . It consisted of 950 bp , containing an open reading frame of 669 bp with 5 0 and 3 0 noncoding regions of 130 and 148 bp , respectively ( Fig . 1 ) . The deduced protein contained 223 amino acid residues and was found to be homologous to members of the DnaJ family . It contained the canonical J domain ( residues 3 – 69 ) including the conserved tripeptide , His - Pro - Asp , and the 50th Ala resi - due . It however , lacked the Gly / Phe - rich or the Cys - rich re - gions which occurred in many DnaJ - like proteins , so belongs to the type III subgroup of DnaJ proteins . RNAs were isolated from various rat tissues and analyzed to determine the tissue expression pattern of rDJL tran - scripts . The result of real - time PCR showed that the rDJL transcripts were most abundant in testis , followed by liver ; whereas other tissues contained inconsequential amounts ( Fig . 2 ) . To determine whether rDJL expression changes with development , total RNAs were prepared from testes of rats at diﬀerent postnatal ages and analyzed by Northern blot . As shown in Fig . 3 , rDJL was initially detected in the testis of day 30 postnatal rat and its expression level reached adult le - vel on the 60th postnatal day . These ﬁndings suggest that the expression of rDJL gene is developmentally regulated and occurred predominantly during the haploid stages of sper - matogenesis . 3 . 2 . Identiﬁcation of rDJL protein by rDJL antiserum To obtain an antiserum speciﬁcally against rDJL , we pro - duced a recombinant fusion protein , GST - rDJL ( 82 – 223 ) , which Fig . 1 .

The expressed fusion protein was puriﬁed by Gluta - thione Sepharose 4B column chromatography ( Fig . 4 ) . Using the puriﬁed recombinant protein as antigen , antise - rum with high titer was raised in rabbits ( ELISA data not shown ) . Western blot analysis showed that the antiserum re - acted with the puriﬁed recombinant protein , and with a speciﬁc component found in the spermatogenic cell lysate ( Fig . 5 ) . The positive stained band corresponded to a protein of about 30 kDa , which is in agreement with the predicted molecular mass of rDJL protein . The localization of rDJL protein in germ cells of normal rat testis at various stages of diﬀerentiation was determined by immunohistochemical technique ( Fig . 6 ) . Meiotic spermato - cytes , round spermatids , elongating spermatids and testicular spermatozoa were immunopositive ; whereas spermatogonia resting directly on the basal lamina were immunonegative . It is noteworthy that the testicular interstitial tissue cells were not stained , demonstrating that rDJL is a gene product re - stricted to germ cells of the seminiferous epithelium . To localize more precisely the subcellular sites of rDJL , iso - lated spermatogenic cell suspensions were freshly prepared , ﬁxed and processed for immunoﬂuorescence microscopy . Samples were counterstained with the DNA intercalating dye Hoechst 33258 . In spermatocytes , rDJL showed a diﬀuse dis - tribution in the cytoplasm . In spermatids , rDJL had a remark - able asymmetrical perinuclear localization that is coincident with that of the developing acrosome . Spermatozoa showed a well delineated immunostained acrosome and , in addition , exhibited staining of the tail ( Fig . 7 ) . The result of immunoﬂu - orescence microscopy suggested that rDJL may play a role in the biogenesis of the acrosome . 3 . 3 . rDJL interacts with Hsc70 and clathrin protein In germ cells , acrosome formation requires the combined synchronized processes of clathrin - coated vesicles (cid:1) traﬃcking and conﬂuence , so the requirement of rDJL in the formation of acrosome may be due to its interaction with a speciﬁc Hsp70 and participation in the dynamics of clathrin - coated vesicles . To determine whether or not rDJL is involved in the formation of clathrin - coated vesicles , the interactions be - tween rDJL and Hsc70 and that of rDJL and clathrin were investigated . HEK293 cells were co - transfected with pcDNA6 / V5 - HisB - HA - rDJL and pEGFP - C3 - clathrin and harvested at 24 h later . Cell lysates were prepared and incubated with anti - HA Fig . 3 .

HA immunoprecipitates were immunoprobed with anti - Hsc70 antibody . As shown in Fig . 8 , endogenous Hsc70 of HEK293 cell was detected in the precipitated complexes , showing an association of rDJL and Hsc70 . Blots were stripped and reprobed with anti - GFP antibody . The result conﬁrmed the occurrence of an interac - tion between rDJL and clathrin . To clarify the function of rDJL in clathrin - coated vesicles , we utilized EGF receptor mediated endocytosis as model to conﬁrm the relationship between rDJL and clathrin [ 19 ] . CHO cells were transfected with pEGFP - C3 - clathrin and pDs - Red1 - N1 - rDJL and treated with EGF . By confocal micros - copy , RFP - rDJL and GFP - clathrin were found as aggregates Fig . 8 .

Yang et al . / FEBS Letters 579 ( 2005 ) 5734 – 5740 in the newly formed endosome vesicles and were co - localized with each other ( Fig . 9 ) , suggesting that rDJL formed a complex with clathrin in the formation of EGFR - mediated endocytic vesicles . 4 . Discussion Mammalian spermatogenesis is a complex phenomenon of cell diﬀerentiation involving mitotic stem cell proliferation and meiosis , followed by remodeling of haploid spermatids , progressing to the formation of mature spermatozoa . Based on the morphological features , the germ cells in various stages in the cycle located in the seminiferous epithelium can be delin - eated by transillumination , allowing isolation by microdissec - tion [ 20 – 22 ] . In the present study , applying the method of DDRT - PCR combined with the segmentation technique of seminiferous tubules , a novel rat DnaJ like protein gene desig - nated rDJL was isolated . The coded rDJL protein contains the highly conserved J domain , but lacks the glycine / phenylala - nine - rich sequence and the cysteine - rich zinc ﬁnger domain , indicating that it belongs to the type III subgroup of DnaJ pro - teins . Type I and type II DnaJ proteins have a more highly conserved J domain within their own groups and tend to inter - act with a broader range of substrates ; whereas type III DnaJ proteins , have a lower degree of conservation and a more re - stricted substrate speciﬁcity [ 23 ] . rDJL is mainly expressed in testis and liver , suggesting that rDJL expression is tissue speciﬁc . Furthermore , in testis , rDJL was found only in germ cells but not in Sertoli or Leydig cells , suggesting that its expression is also cell type speciﬁc . The earliest developmental expression of rDJL gene oc - curred in rat testis on the 30th postnatal day and its expression reached adult level on the 60th postnatal day and maintained at the high level subsequently . In the 60 - day - old rat testis , its content in round and elongating spermatids is substantial [ 24 , 25 ] . Hence , the development - dependent expression pattern of rDJL indicates participation in spermiogenesis , whereby haploid spermatids undergo a series of changes in structure and function and eventually develop into mature spermato - zoa . The process includes chromosome condensation , forma - tion of acrosome and ﬂagellum and expulsion of redundant cytoplasm . The present immunoﬂuorescent ﬁndings showing that rDJL is located asymmetrically in the perinuclear area of round and elongating spermatids and in the acrosome of mature sper - matozoa suggest that it plays a role in the formation of the acrosome . Acrosome plays a key role during the process of sperm cell maturation , capacitation and fertilization . Thus studies on acrosome formation may uncover important clues about the mechanism of fertilizing potential of sperm . Acro - some originate from the trans - Golgi apparatus and contain hydrolytic enzymes that aid sperm in penetrating the egg (cid:1) s outer membrane . The formation of acrosome is a process involving vesicle traﬃcking and conﬂuence during which clathrin - coated vesicles act as the principal transport media [ 26 ] . So we hypoth - esized that rDJL may be a structural component of clathrin - coated vesicle . The present experimental results demonstrate that rDJL can co - immunoprecipitate with Hsc70 and clathrin protein . Furthermore , in EGF - treated CHO cells transfected with pEGFP - C3 - clathrin and pDsRed1 - N1 - rDJL , rDJL was concentrated in the newly formed endosome vesicles and co - localized with clathrin protein . These ﬁndings suggest that rDJL is a component of the clathrin - coated vesicle and may participate in vesicular traﬃcking within germ cells , thus con - tributing to the biogenesis of acrosomes . rDJL is a small mole - cule and does not possess a clathrin - binding domain , indicating that the interaction of rDJL and clathrin may be indirect and probably mediated by another unidentiﬁed component . During the process of fertilization , when a sperm contacts an egg , the content of the vesicle is released by exocytosis as the acrosomal reaction . Previous studies suggest that proteins participating in the intracellular traﬃcking events leading to the formation of the acrosome during mammalian spermiogen - esis are also involved in regulating the acrosome reaction during fertilization [ 27 ] . The presence of rDJL in the acrosome of mature spermatozoa points to a possible function during fertilization .
