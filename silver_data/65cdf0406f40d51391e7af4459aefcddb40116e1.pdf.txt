Bloom , Harvard School of Public Health , Boston , MA , and approved June 29 , 2011 ( received for review November 3 , 2010 ) Mycolactone is a macrolide produced by Mycobacterium ulcerans with immunomodulatory properties . Here , we describe that in mouse , mycolactone injection led to a massive T - cell depletion in peripheral lymph nodes ( PLNs ) that was associated with defective expression of L - selectin ( CD62 - L ) . Importantly , preexposure to mycolactone impaired the capacity of T cells to reach PLNs after adoptive transfer , respond to chemotactic signals , and expand upon antigenic stimulation in vivo . We found that mycolactone - in - duced suppression of CD62 - L expression by human primary T cells was induced rapidly at both the mRNA and protein levels and cor - related with the reduced expression of one miRNA : let - 7b . Notably , silencing of let - 7b was suf ﬁ cient to inhibit CD62 - L gene expression . Conversely , its overexpression tended to up - regulate CD62 - L and counteract the effects of mycolactone . Our results identify T - cell homing as a biological process targeted by mycolactone . Moreover , they reveal a mechanism of control of CD62 - L expression involving the miRNA let - 7b . M ycolactone is a diffusible macrolide produced by Myco - bacterium ulcerans , the causative agent of a chronic skin disease called Buruli ulcer ( BU ) ( 1 ) . Mycolactone production is critical for bacterial virulence and underpins the pathogenesis of lesions marked by a striking lack of in ﬂ ammatory in ﬁ ltrates . The immune pro ﬁ ling of patients has recently revealed systemic defects in the production of multiple T - cell cytokines , suggesting that mycolactone impairs the generation of cellular responses ( 2 ) . In line with this hypothesis , mycolactone was reported to suppress the production of various cytokines by monocytes , lym - phocytes , and dendritic cells ( DCs ) in vitro ( 3 – 6 ) . The mechanism by which mycolactone modulates protein expression in a gene - and cell - speci ﬁ c manner nevertheless remains mysterious , as differently from known immunosuppressants , mycolactone acts independently of the mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) . Studies in mice have shown that s . c . - delivered mycolactone gains access to the leukocytes of the peripheral blood and lym - phoid organs and triggers immune defects comparable with those observed in BU patients ( 7 ) . The mouse model therefore appears appropriate to study the impact of mycolactone on cellular responses in vivo . Mycolactone blocks the maturation and mi - gration of DCs in the mouse ( 5 ) ; however , whether it impairs the traf ﬁ cking properties of T cells , the key players in the adaptive immune response to pathogens , is still unknown . In this process , the capacity of naive T cells to gain access to peripheral lymph nodes ( PLNs ) and make contact with antigen - presenting cells is of critical importance . T - cell homing to PLNs is controlled by the expression of the receptors L - selectin ( CD62 - L ) , C - C chemokine receptor 7 ( CCR7 ) , and lymphocyte function - associated antigen 1 ( LFA - 1 ) . High expression of CD62 - L on the surface of naive T cells is essential for the initial steps of tethering and rolling of circulating lymphocytes in the high endothelial venules ( HEV ) of peripheral LNs , whereas CCR7 and LFA - 1 play a crucial role in the subsequent adhesion of T cells to HEV ( 8 ) . Within the LNs , T cells then migrate to specialized T - cell zones , where CCR7 - driven motility is vital for scanning antigens presented by DCs ( 9 ) . Here , we have used a combination of transgenic mouse models , LN explants , and human primary T cells to evaluate the impact of mycolactone on T - cell dynamics . We found that s . c . - delivered mycolactone modi ﬁ ed the expression of CD62 - L , CCR7 , and LFA - 1 on circulating T cells . These alterations had major con - sequences on the capacity of T cells to home to PLNs and on the intensity of cellular responses driven by antigen . We identi ﬁ ed the let - 7b microRNA ( miRNA ) as a regulatory component of CD62 - L expression in human T cells and provided a mechanistic ex - planation for how mycolactone regulates CD62 - L expression by altering let - 7b levels . Our results uncover a unique biological property of mycolactone through the regulation of T - cell traf - ﬁ cking and demonstrate that CD62 - L expression is partially reg - ulated by the let - 7b miRNA . Results Mycolactone Induces T - Cell Depletion in PLNs . In mice injected with mycolactone via the s . c . route , we observed a macroscopic and dose - dependent reduction in the size of all PLNs ( as illustrated in Fig . 1 A by inguinal LNs ) . This effect was maximal after 24 h and persisted for a few days ( > 5 d with 100 μ g of mycolactone ) . Histological analysis of the PLNs showed a massive cellular de - pletion affecting both the B - and T - cell zones ( Fig . 1 B , a and b ) . In contrast , the HEV through which lymphocytes leave the blood to enter PLNs showed unaltered levels of peripheral node vas - cular adressin ( PNAd ) , the ligand of CD62 - L ( Fig . 1 B , c ) . Moreover , the overall structure of the PLNs , as visualized by staining of the stromal matrix with the ER - TR7 ﬁ broblast marker , was preserved ( Fig . 1 B , d ) . Focusing on T cells , we found that CD4 + and CD8 + lymphocytes were comparably depleted in PLNs ( Fig . 1 C ) . A concomitant increase in CD4 + and CD8 + blood T cells was observed . Since mycolactone displays cytopathic effects in vitro ( 10 ) , we assessed T - cell viability in mycolactone - injected mice . Con ﬁ rming our previous studies showing that pri - mary T cells are relatively resistant to mycolactone cytotoxicity ( 6 ) , no evidence of enhanced apoptosis could be demonstrated by ﬂ ow - cytometric analysis of T cells in peripheral blood , PLNs and spleen , or by staining of LN sections ( Fig . S1 ) . Together , these data suggested that mycolactone affects T - cell homing to PLNs . Author contributions : L . G . - M . , F . C . , F . A . - B . , V . D . B . , G . B . , and C .

We thus examined the impact of mycolactone on T - cell expression of homing receptors . In mice injected with myco - lactone , the expression of CD62 - L by blood CD4 + and CD8 + T cells was markedly suppressed ( Fig . 2 A ) . Maximal decrease was reached after 14 h , after which T - cell concentration in the blood increased rapidly ( Fig . 2 A ) . Twenty - four hours after injection , the expression of CD62 - L by LN T cells was also largely reduced ( Fig . 2 B and Fig . S2 A ) . LFA - 1 levels were also impaired , but to a lesser extent . In contrast , T - cell expression of CCR7 was up - regulated by mycolactone . To demonstrate that mycolactone was directly responsible for these phenotypic changes , T cells puri ﬁ ed from PLNs were cultured in the presence of mycolactone in vitro . The same characteristic CD62 - L lo CCR7 hi LFA - 1 lo T - cell phe - notype was induced ( Fig . 2 C and Fig . S2 B ) . Maximal effects were observed at mycolactone concentrations > 50 ng / mL , in both the CD4 + and CD8 + T cells ( Fig . S2 C ) . Mycolactone - Treated T Cells Have Impaired Homing Capacity and Weaker CCR7 - Driven Motility . The impact of mycolactone on the traf ﬁ cking properties of T cells was further investigated in adoptive transfer experiments . Here , naive T cells were puri ﬁ ed from donor mice and exposed to mycolactone , or vehicle as control , for 16 h . Mycolactone - treated cells and controls were then labeled with two distinct concentrations of 5 - chloromethyl - ﬂ uorescein diacetate ( CMFDA ) to distinguish the two cell pop - ulations , mixed , and injected i . v . into recipient mice . After 4 h , cell suspensions were prepared from PLNs and spleen , and the CMFDA ﬂ uorescence was analyzed by FACS . Consistent with their lack of CD62 - L expression , T cells exposed to mycolactone before transfer were recovered in the PLNs at lower frequencies than unexposed T cells ( Fig . 3 A ) . In comparison , the impact of mycolactone on T - cell recruitment to the spleen was of minor importance . Since CD62 - L is not critical for T - cell homing to the spleen ( 11 ) , this observation suggested that mycolactone pri - marily targets CD62 - L – dependent homing processes . Mobility of naive T cells within LNs largely depends on CCL19 and CCL21 , the two ligands of CCR7 ( 12 – 14 ) . Having shown that mycolactone up - regulates the expression of CCR7 on naive T cells , we investigated whether mycolactone - exposed T cells had an increased responsiveness to CCR7 stimulation . T cells puri ﬁ ed from mouse PLNs were incubated in vitro with myco - lactone , or vehicle as control . We then stained the cells with two distinct ﬂ uorescent dyes , loaded them onto LN slices kept alive in a warm oxygenated medium , and recorded their movements ( Movie S1 ) . We reported that in these conditions , naive T cells adopt the motile behavior of resident cells , which largely depends on CCR7 signaling ( 9 ) . This motility has been shown to be a chemokinesis ( random ) more than a chemotaxis ( gradient C A Mycolactone ( g ) 50 100 0 LNs 10 6 c e ll s Blood 10 6 c e ll s / m l B 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 CD4 + CD8 + Ctrl Mycolactone 0 1 2 3 4 5 CD4 + CD8 + a b c d Red : CD3 Green : B220 Red : CD3 Green : ER - TR7 Red : CD3 Green : PNAd Fig . 1 .

Both parameters were reduced in mycolactone - ex - posed T cells compared with controls ( Fig . 3 B ) . Mycolactone also reduced the motility of T cells plated on an ICAM - 1 layer and stimulated with CCL19 ( Fig . S3 A ) . However , it did not affect signi ﬁ cantly T - cell migration toward CCL19 in transwell assays ( Fig . S3 B ) , suggesting that mycolactone impairs CCR7 - driven T - cell motility by altering chemokinesis rather than chemotaxis . Mycolactone Impairs T - Cell Response to Antigen in Vivo . Myco - lactone - exposed T cells had an impaired capacity to home to PLNs and a reduced motility within these tissues , both processes being essential for ef ﬁ cient T - cell responses . To measure the impact of mycolactone treatment on the ability of T cells to mount primary responses , we used CD45 . 1 + CD45 . 2 + or CD45 . 2 + OT - I CD8 + T cells , which both express a TCR speci ﬁ c for the SIIN - FEKL peptide of ovalbumin ( OVA ) . Once puri ﬁ ed from PLNs , these cells were labeled with carboxy ﬂ uorescein succinimidyl es - ter ( CFSE ) and incubated for 16 h with mycolactone or vehicle , respectively . After this treatment , CD45 . 1 + CD45 . 2 + OT - I T cells showed the characteristic CD62 - L lo CCR7 hi phenotype observed for mycolactone - treated wild - type T lymphocytes . We then mixed the two OT - I T - cell populations , using larger inputs of myco - lactone - treated cells so that comparable numbers of control and mycolactone - exposed cells reached the draining LNs , and injec - ted them i . v . into normal recipient mice . Concomitantly , mice were given a s . c . injection of OVA in the footpad . The pro - liferation of adoptively transferred T cells was then analyzed in draining LNs 48 h after immunization . Fig . 4 A shows that myco - lactone - treated OT - I T cells reaching the LNs divided actively in response to antigen . However , their CFSE dilution pro ﬁ le showed a delay in proliferation , as evidenced by the lower number of mycolactone - exposed cells in the last division peak compared with control cells ( Fig . 4 B ) . Therefore , mycolactone limits the intensity of host T - cell responses to antigen primarily by inhibiting their homing properties . Mechanism of Mycolactone - Induced Suppression of CD62 - L . Having characterized the consequences of mycolactone - induced sup - pression of CD62 - L on the functions of T cells in the mouse system , we examined whether the same effects applied to human cells and explored the underlying molecular mechanism . The surface expression of CD62 - L by CD4 + T cells puri ﬁ ed from human peripheral blood was reduced after 20 h of mycolactone treatment ( Fig . 5 A ) . This reduction was not due to intracellular accumulation of the receptor , because CD62 - L suppression was detected in permeabilized cells after only 4 h ( Fig . 5 A ) . Since CD62 - L expression is negatively regulated by proteolytic cleav - age from the cell surface , we measured the concentration of soluble CD62 - L ( sCD62 - L ) in culture supernatants . Compared with controls , mycolactone - treated cells released lower amounts of sCD62 - L , indicating that mycolactone does not suppress CD62 - L expression by promoting extracellular shedding of the receptor ( Fig . S4 A ) . To determine whether mycolactone instead promoted the intracellular elimination of CD62 - L , we used MG132 , an inhibitor of proteosome and lysosome functions . MG132 did not restore higher levels of the receptor in cells pretreated with mycolactone for 20 h , ruling out this possibility ( Fig . S4 B ) . These results suggested that mycolactone modulates the rate of CD62 - L production rather than its elimination . A transcriptional analysis revealed that CD62 - L mRNA were slightly less abundant in cells treated with mycolactone than in controls ( Fig . 5 B ) . This inhibition was detectable after 4 h and persisted until 20 h . Because CD62 - L gene expression is con - trolled in human T cells by the Forkhead box O 1 ( FOXO1 ) / Kruppel - like factor 2 ( KLF2 ) transcriptional axis , the expression of KLF2 was also examined ( 15 – 17 ) . KLF2 was not modulated in mycolactone - exposed T cells ( Fig . 5 B ) , suggesting that myco - lactone down - regulates CD62 - L transcription by a FOXO1 / KLF2 - independent mechanism . To determine whether mycolactone modi ﬁ ed the expression of other potential regulators of CD62 - L transcription , T cells were subjected to a global transcriptomic analysis . However , no signi ﬁ cant alterations in mRNA expression could be identi ﬁ ed . 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Ctrl Myco Ctrl Myco LN Spleen T ce ll ho m i ng ( % o f c on t r o l ) 0 2 4 6 8 10 Ctrl Myco 0 10 20 30 Ctrl Myco M o t ili t y C o e ff i c i e n t ( m / m i n ) V e l o c i t y ( m / m i n ) * * * B A * NS Fig . 3 .

PNAS | August 2 , 2011 | vol . 108 | no . 31 | 12835 I MM U N O L O G Y Because microRNA ( miRNAs ) can regulate gene transcription and translation , we tested the possibility that mycolactone uses this mechanism to repress CD62 - L expression , by a microarray approach . miRNAs from Jurkat T cells , a CD4 + T - cell line , were analyzed after 30 min of exposure to mycolactone , because this time point was optimal for CD62 - L mRNA suppression in this model . Of the 377 miRNAs tested , 149 could be detected . Among the 18 miRNAs whose levels changed upon mycolactone treat - ment by more than twofold , the greatest alteration was in let - 7b expression ( Fig . S5 ) . Mycolactone - induced down - regulation of let - 7b was observed consistently in Jurkat cells ( Fig . 5 C ) . Impor - tantly , let - 7b was also suppressed by mycolactone in human pri - mary CD4 + T cells exposed to mycolactone for 4 h ( Fig . 5 C ) , and in mouse LN T cells treated for 1 h , establishing the inhibitory action of mycolactone on this miRNA . We then asked whether let - 7b interfered with the expression of CD62 - L by transfecting T cells with either a let - 7b inhibitor or a premiR - let - 7b precursor . Here , experiments were performed in Jurkat cells or PBLs , be - cause mRNA recovery from primary CD4 + T cells after trans - fection was limiting . Notably , silencing of let - 7b resulted in the down - regulation of CD62 - L mRNAs ( Fig . 5 D ) . Although statis - tical signi ﬁ cance was not reached because of marked differences in CD62 - L mRNA values among donors , overexpression of let - 7b induced a trend toward up - regulation of CD62 - L gene expression ( Fig . 5 E ) , counteracting the inhibitory effect of mycolactone . From these results , we concluded that mycolactone suppresses CD62 - L expression in T cells by inhibiting let - 7b – mediated pos - itive regulation of CD62 - L . Discussion Mycolactone was known to block the capacity of primary T cells to produce multiple cytokines upon activation ( 2 , 6 ) . Here , we show that mycolactone also impairs their migratory properties . Mycolactone imprinted a characteristic CD62 - L lo CCR7 hi sig - nature on T cells in vitro and in vivo , leading to defective homing to PLNs . The same phenotypic alterations were observed in B cells . Consistent with the fact that CD62 - L expression controls B - cell entry in LNs ( 18 ) , these cells were also depleted from PLNs in mycolactone - injected mice ( Fig . 1 B ) . Optimal clonal expansion of T cells requires that they migrate inside secondary lymphoid organs and travel within the T - cell zone to encounter the antigens presented by DCs . In agreement with our demonstration that both mechanisms , namely homing and intranodal motility , were inhibited by mycolactone , a reduced number of T - cell divisions was observed in our OT - I transfer experiments ( Fig . 4 ) . Within LNs , T - cell motility is mostly trig - gered by CCR7 and its ligands CCL19 and CCL21 ( 9 , 19 , 20 ) . Our observations that mycolactone affected CCL19 - induced motility in T cells loaded onto an ICAM - 1 layer but not in transwell mi - gration assays ( Fig . S3 ) suggest that it may a have a selective impact on random motility . Mycolactone modulated the expression of CD62 - L at the transcriptional level . Recent studies have identi ﬁ ed the tran - scription factor FOXO1 as a master regulator of CD62 - L tran - scription , likely via the expression of KLF2 . In quiescent T cells , active FOXO1 in the nucleus maintains expression of KLF2 , which regulates the expression of CCR7 and CD62 - L ( 15 – 17 , 21 – 26 ) . However , mycolactone reduced the transcription of CD62 - L without modulating the expression of KLF2 ( Fig . 5 B ) . Moreover , it modulated CD62 - L and CCR7 in opposite directions , whereas both receptors are positively regulated by the FOXO1 / KLF2 axis . Because mycolactone triggers the activation of Lck in primary T cells ( 6 ) , we also examined whether Lck somehow participated to mycolactone - induced suppression of CD62 - L . However , myco - lactone suppressed CD62 - L expression in Lck - de ﬁ cient Jurkat T cells , ruling out this possibility . Our study shows that other pathways exist that regulate the expression of homing receptors in T cells and identi ﬁ es let - 7b as a factor contributing to the control of CD62 - L expression . Let - 7b belongs to a highly conserved miRNA family , which in humans contains let - 7a - g / I and the related miR - 98 and miR - 202 ( 27 ) . The LIN28 protein in Caenorhabditis elegans and its homologs in mammalian cells LIN28 and LIN28B have been shown to control the temporal expression of all let - 7 family A 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 0 10 20 30 40 M F I ( % o f c on t r o l ) Incubation time ( h ) CD62L total CD62L surface C D B - 1 , 5 - 1 - 0 , 5 0 l og 2 f o l d c h a ng e l e t - 7 b * * Jurkat PBLs Myco : - + - + - 1 , 5 - 1 - 0 , 5 0 l og 2 f o l d c h a ng e CD 62 - L * Anti let - 7b : - + KLF2 CD62 - L 4h 20h 48h - 1 , 5 - 1 - 0 , 5 0 0 , 5 1 l og 2 f o l d c h a ng e NS * * * NS * * NS NS E l og 2 f o l d c h a ng e CD 62 - L * NS Fig . 5 .

Our microarray analysis showed that mycolactone reduces the ex - pression of let - 7b without affecting the other members of the family , suggesting that mycolactone - mediated repression does not proceed via LIN28 / LIN28B . miRNAs generally function as gene silencers repressing translation and / or directing the se - quence - speci ﬁ c degradation of complementary mRNA . They were found in some instances to enhance gene expression by interacting with promoter sequences ( 29 ) . We found that let - 7b regulated the expression of CD62 - L positively . Since we failed to identify a sequence complementary to let - 7b in the CD62 - L gene and ﬂ anking regions , it seems unlikely that let - 7b activates CD62 - L transcription directly and rather modulates the expres - sion of transcriptional and / or translational regulators of CD62 - L . Proteomic studies have shown that variations in let - 7b levels ﬁ nely tune the production of thousands of proteins ( 30 ) . Hence , down - regulation of let - 7b by mycolactone is likely to trigger a cascade of events leading to the modulation of CD62 - L expres - sion and , potentially , other factors not studied here . Through the study of CD62 - L , our work elucidates a molecular mechanism by which mycolactone modulates mammalian gene expression . Mycolactone has been shown to block the expression of cytokines and chemokines by human leukocytes without major impact on gene transcription ( 3 , 6 ) . Overexpression of let - 7b in T cells did not restore their capacity to produce IL - 2 upon acti - vation , suggesting that mycolactone might suppress the expression of target genes that are induced during cell activation by modu - lating other miRNAs . Keeping in mind that mycolactone does not induce a deep alteration of gene transcription , as assessed by mRNA microarray , a detailed analysis of the miRNA tran - scriptome of cells activated in the presence of mycolactone should allow one to better understand the molecular pathways targeted by this toxin . Understanding the impact of mycolactone - mediated modulation of miRNA expression will not only help understand the pathogenesis of BU disease , but also provide a paradigm for how miRNAs modulate immune responses . Materials and Methods Animals . Six - week - old female C57Bl6 / J ( B6 ) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory . CD45 . 2 + OT - I and CD45 . 1 + mice were obtained from Charles River and bred under SPF conditions . F 1 mice ( CD45 . 1 + CD45 . 2 + OT - I ) transgenic mice were produced by crossing CD45 . 1 + B6 with CD45 . 2 + OT - I . All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Na - tional French Veterinary Department . Mycolactone . Mycolactone was puri ﬁ ed from M . ulcerans 1615 ( ATCC 35840 ) cultures as described and stock solutions kept in ethanol ( 7 ) . For injections , these stocks were diluted 10 × in PBS and a 150 - μ L volume injected s . c . at the base of the tail . For cellular assays , they were diluted at least 1 , 000 × in culture medium . In all cases , mycolactone - treated samples were compared with vehicle - treated controls . T - CellIsolationandCulture .

Human primary T cells were isolated from blood donors by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation . When required , CD4 + T - cell puri ﬁ cation was per - formed by negative depletion ( Dynal Biotech ) . A Jurkat cell variant JCaM1 ( referred to as Jurkat in this study ) was used in miRNA studies . T cells were cultured in RPMI medium 1640 ( Seromed ) + 10 % FCS ( Dominique Dutscher ) , supplemented with 10ng / mL rhIL - 7 in thecase of mouse T cells ( R & D Systems ) . Flow Cytometry and Histological Analyses . FITC or PE - conjugated CD62 - L , PerCP - conjugatedCD4 , APC - conjugatedCD8werefromBectonDickinson . PE - conjugated CCR7 and biotin - conjugated CD127 were from eBioscience , and Alexa - Fluor 488 - conjugated streptavidin from Invitrogen . Cells were ana - lyzed with a FACScalibur ﬂ ow cytometer ( Becton Dickinson ) . For hematoxylin and eosin staining , LNs were ﬁ xed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS , paraf ﬁ n - embedded , and cut on 4 - μ m - thick sections . After deparaf ﬁ nization , sections were incubated in hematoxylin then differentiated by using a lithium car - bonate solution . Next , slides were incubated in eosin , rinsed , and ﬁ nally dehydrated with ethanol . For immunostaining , PLNs were embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature ( OCT ) compound ( Tissue - Tek ) and frozen into liquid nitrogen - chilled isopentane . Blocks were sliced into 7 - μ m - thick sec - tions by using a Leica cryostat ( Leica CM 3050S ) and sections attached to Superfrost PLUS glass coverslips ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c ) . They were then washed in PBS + 3 % BSA and stained overnight at 4 °C with unconjugated anti - CD3 and biotinylated anti - B220 or biotinylated anti - PNAd or unconjugated anti - ER - TR7 antibodies . Alexa Fluor 488 - conjugated streptavidin ( Invitrogen ) , a DyLight 594 Goat Anti - Armenian Hamster antibody ( Jackson ImmunoR - esearch ) , and an Alexa Fluor 488 anti - Rat IgG were used as secondary reagents . In situ cell death detection was performed on PLN sections as recommended ( in situ cell death detection kit ; Roche ) . Adoptive Transfer and in Vivo Proliferation Assays . For adoptive transfer experiments , controlormycolactone - treated T cells ( 10 × 10 6 / mL ) were loaded with 2 or 200 nM CMFDA ( Molecular Probes ) in PBS at 37 °C for 5 min , washed twice in PBS , mixed ( 2 × 10 6 of each ) , and injected i . v . into recipients . For in vivo proliferation assays , T cells ( 20 × 10 6 / mL ) puri ﬁ ed from PLNsof CD45 . 1 + CD45 . 2 + OT - I mice and CD45 . 2 + OT - I mice were labeled with 2 μ M of CFSE ( Molecular Probes ) 7 min at 37 °C in PBS , washed twice in complete medium and cultured overnight with or without mycolactone , respectively . The two cell populations were then mixed ( 2 . 5 × 10 6 CD45 . 1 + CD45 . 2 + and 0 . 5 × 10 6 CD45 . 2 + OT - I cells ) and injected i . v . into CD45 . 1 recipients . Four hundred micrograms of OVA in saline was injected at the same time in the hind footpad . Mice were killed 48 h later , and draining LNs were analyzed for T - cell proliferation . T - Cell Motility Analyses . For video imaging of T cells in lymphoid tissues , LN slices were prepared from PLNs as described ( 9 ) . Puri ﬁ ed PLN T cells ( 2 × 10 6 / mL ) were incubated overnight with 100 ng / mL mycolactone or vehicle as control , then stained with 0 . 5 μ M Cell Trace calcein green or red ( Molecular Probes ) . Labeled - T cells ( 10 5 cells in 20 μ L RPMI medium 1640 + 10 % FCS ) were then deposited onto the cut surface of each slice . Imaging was per - formed with an inverted microscope at 37 °C . Stacks of four sections ( z step = 13 . 3 μ m ) were acquired with the MetaView software ( Universal Imaging ) every 20 s for 20 min . Cell motility was analyzed with the Imaris software ( version 5 . 7 ; Bitplane ) . For in vitro analyses of T - cell motility , glass coverslips were coated overnight at 4 °C with 3 μ g / mL human ICAM - 1 – Fc ( R & D Sys - tems ) , washed with PBS , and blocked with PBS containing 1 % BSA for 30 min at 37 °C . T cells prepared as above were plated on the ICAM - 1 layer and stimulated with 100 ng / mL recombinant CCL19 ( PeproTech ) . Images were acquired every 4 s by using an inverted microscope equipped with a 60 × objective and the MetaView software and analyzed with Imaris . For trans - well assays , PLN T cells were cultured for 18 – 24 h at 2 × 10 6 cells per mL in the presence of 100 ng / mL mycolactone . T cells ( 3 × 10 5 ) in RPMI medium 1640 / 0 . 5 % BSA were then placed in the upper chambers of 24 - well transwell plates with 5 - μ m pore membrane insert ( Corning ) , with 100 ng / mL of CCL19 in the lower chamber , and allowed to migrate for 3 h at 37 °C . Cells in the lower chamber were then mixed with an equal amount of ﬂ ow check ﬂ u - orospheres ( Beckman Coulter ) and quanti ﬁ ed by ﬂ ow cytometry . Quantitative Real - Time PCR ( Q - PCR ) . Total RNA was extracted from human CD4 + T cells with the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit and digested with TURBO DNase ( Ambion ) for 15 min at 37 °C .
