An Extreme - Value Model of Concept Testing Ely Dahan • Haim Mendelson MIT Sloan School of Management , Building E56 - 323 , Cambridge , Massachusetts 02142 - 1347 Graduate School of Business , Stanford University , Stanford , California 94305 - 5015 edahan @ mit . edu • haim @ stanford . edu W e model concept testing in new product development as a search for the most prof - itable solution to a design problem . When allocating resources , developers must bal - ance the cost of testing multiple designs against the potential proﬁts that may result . We propose extreme - value theory as a mathematical abstraction of the concept - testing process . We investigate the trade - off between the beneﬁts and costs of parallel concept testing and derive closed - form solutions for the case of proﬁts that follow extreme - value distributions . We analyze the roles of the scale and tail - shape parameters of the proﬁt distribution as well as the cost of testing in determining the optimal number of tests and total budget for the concept phase of NPD . Using an example , we illustrate how to estimate and interpret the scale and tail - shape parameters . We ﬁnd that the impact of declining concept - testing costs on expected proﬁts , the number of concepts tested , and total spending depend on the scale / cost ratio and tail - shape parameter of the proﬁt distribution .

Introduction The concept - generation , - testing and - selection phases of new product development ( NPD ) may be thought of as a search for the most proﬁtable solution to a design problem . The idea generation and testing methods that comprise the “fuzzy front end” of NPD provide information to designers about the customer utility , technical feasibility , and cost of a new prod - uct . Allocating resources at this early stage poses quite a challenge considering the inherent uncertainty . In particular , uncertainty arises from imperfect infor - mation about customers and markets , undiscovered or untested product designs and technologies , and the challenges of perfectly executing and delivering even an ideal design . Concept tests help resolve this uncertainty and , in our terminology , encompass most methods used to measure the performance of new products and processes along those dimensions affect - ing proﬁtability . Methods such as voice of the customer ( VOC ) ( Grifﬁn and Hauser 1993 ) , lead user analysis , con - joint analysis , Kano methods , and Pugh concept selec - tion ( cf . Dahan and Hauser 2001 ) clarify and focus the fuzzy front end of NPD . For example , contex - tual inquiry and VOC methods help identify key product attributes , and conjoint analysis ( cf . Green and Srinivasan 1990 ) quantiﬁes the importance of each attribute and the degree of price sensitivity , pro - viding designers with the information to optimize attribute - level trade - offs for speciﬁc market segments . Customer - ready prototypes reveal technical prob - lems and opportunities that might have been over - looked in the design’s conceptual phase ( Srinivasan et al . 1997 ) . Product archeology ( Ulrich and Pearson 1998 ) and design for manufacturability ( Boothroyd and Dewhurst 1994 ) help to identify potential cost savings through product simpliﬁcation and process improvement . Management Science © 2001 INFORMS Vol . 47 , No . 1 , January 2001 pp . 102 – 116 0025 - 1909 / 01 / 4701 / 0102 $ 5 . 00 1526 - 5501 electronic ISSN DAHAN AND MENDELSON An Extreme - Value Model of Concept Testing Concept testing may be thought of as a search for the “best” design , positioning , pricing , and manu - facturing of a new product . But how much budget should be allocated to testing new product concepts ? And how many tests should be conducted ? “Inno - vation” through multiple product concepts increases expected proﬁt through the discovery of incremen - tally better designs , but because concepts are costly to generate and test , the design team must balance costs and beneﬁts to maximize expected proﬁts net of the cost of testing . To place the present article in context , we divide prior research related to concept testing into three broad categories : ( 1 ) models of search , ( 2 ) the real options nature of R & D , and ( 3 ) methods of experi - mentation and testing . Models from the broad literature on optimal search provide insight into the economics of concept testing . Nelson ( 1961 ) and Abernathy and Rosenbloom ( 1968 ) model product development efforts as a series of stochastic events with discrete outcomes , and demon - strate the value of conducting tests in parallel when time is of the essence . They show that the cost per test and scale of uncertainty drive the optimal num - ber of parallel concepts to be developed . Thomke con - tributes the view that experimentation in NPD solves problems , uncovers bugs and reduces errors ( 1998a ) , broadens search and improves learning through par - allel testing , and impacts the competitive positions ( and implicitly the proﬁts ) of ﬁrms that adopt new methods of experimentation ( 1998c ) . In short , these authors pave the way for the view of NPD as search through parallel testing , an idea that motivates the present research . Gross ( 1967 ) develops a one - period model of opti - mal parallel search incorporating residual uncertainty after the advertising campaigns are designed and tested . The number of parallel concepts to be tested is determined heuristically . Loch et al . ( 1999 ) also allow noisy testing outcomes and develop optimal parallel and sequential testing policies that minimize the cost and time of testing . Srinivasan et al . ( 1997 ) provide empirical evidence that parallel prototyping resolves some of the residual uncertainty remaining following the concept generation stage of product design . They show that , under reasonable assump - tions , parallel prototyping is more proﬁtable than a one - shot approach , and propose parallel development of customer - ready prototypes as an attractive method of reducing risk in the mid to late stages of NPD . One insight from previous work , quantiﬁed explicitly in this paper , is that additional tests are conducted until the marginal beneﬁt of an additional test equals the marginal cost of conducting it . The present analysis , recognizing that concept selection is a search for proﬁt extremes , develops closed - form solutions for the optimal number of tests under the three extreme - value distributions . This leads to the key ﬁnding that the number of concept tests under proﬁt uncertainty depends not only on the cost of testing and the scale of uncertainty , but also on the upper tail - shape of that uncertainty . A second line of research suggests that multiple product concepts be viewed as real options . Hauser ( 1996 ) provides a comprehensive annotated bibliogra - phy on valuing R & D projects , including research on their real options nature . For example , Hauser and Zettelmeyer ( 1996 ) characterize optimal policies for managing R & D portfolios and show the value of the options provided by alternative solutions to a given problem , even if the alternatives come from R & D spillovers from outside ﬁrms . Baldwin and Clark ( 2000 ) apply an options approach to the issue of mod - ularity in product and process design . While product concepts create real options , so does the ﬂexibility to abandon an unproﬁtable NPD effort at the con - cept development stage . The present paper values the option of retaining NPD decision ﬂexibility at the con - cept selection phase and analyzes the factors driving the value of this ﬂexibility . The third line of prior research proposes new forms and methods of NPD experimentation and studies their implications . This research stream sug - gests that experimentation requires appropriate pro - cesses , resources , and organizational structures . In a rapidly changing market environment , the concept phase must facilitate high - speed , high - performance innovation . Smith and Reinertsen ( 1995 ) emphasize the importance of speeding up new product devel - opment and suggest multiple parallel tests as one method for doing so . Leonard - Barton ( 1995 ) coins the Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 1 , January 2001 103 DAHAN AND MENDELSON An Extreme - Value Model of Concept Testing term “failing forward” to describe experimentation in which ﬁrms learn from failures and take advantage of the creativity inherent in highly variable experimen - tal outcomes . Wheelwright and Clark ( 1992 ) discuss the positive and negative organizational implications of having internal teams compete to design the same new product . Thomke et al . ( 1997 ) demonstrate how new technology facilitates parallel testing of solutions to technical problems . They cite , as an example , com - binatorial chemistry in which pharmaceutical ﬁrms conduct large numbers of parallel tests in the search for new drugs . This body of research conﬁrms the nonobvious notion that NPD success results as much from the many concepts that are discarded as from those few that are launched . Further , the economics of parallel concept test - ing continue to improve . Combinatorial prototyp - ing methods ( Thomke et al . 1998 ) enable researchers to efﬁciently search through thousands of variations of custom - designed chemical compounds to see , for example , which metallic oxide is the best super - conductor or which organic compound is the most pharmacologically active . Rapid prototyping allows computer - controlled equipment to create topologi - cally complex physical prototypes using layering , etching , and 3 - D printing techniques in place of tra - ditional methods such as machining and casting . The economics of getting “from art to ( prototyped ) part” continue to improve , making high - ﬁdelity concept testing even more affordable . In summary , the attrac - tiveness of multiple parallel concept tests is enhanced by the steady cost decline and improved availability of new technologies . More recently , Internet - based tests that enable low - cost , high - speed market testing of new product con - cepts have emerged . Dahan and Srinivasan ( 2000 ) compare static and animated methods of Web - based visual depiction against traditional paper - and - pencil conjoint methods and physical , customer - ready pro - totypes . Their results show that Web - based methods are fast , effective in measuring market potential , and 1 low in cost . Dahan and Hauser ( 2001 ) describe meth - ods of adaptive - conjoint questioning and interactive user design of new product concepts that portends highly efﬁcient market research uniquely tailored to each respondent . And Chan et al . ( 2000 ) employ Secu - rities Trading of Concepts ( STOC ) , a stock - trading game in which securities represent competing prod - uct ideas , to assess market preferences for multiple concepts . In summary , the emergence of the Inter - net should profoundly affect concept testing by virtue of application of the three Cs of Web - based market research : communication , computation , and concep - tualization . Of course , the Web may also lower the cost of con - ducting concept tests . Declining testing costs improve the economics of NPD , not only because of poten - tial R & D savings , but also because of the ability to innovate more by testing a larger number of poten - tial product solutions . Virtual and rapid prototyping techniques portend dramatic declines in the cost per concept test and allow designs to be evaluated with - out the expense and time requirements of physical prototyping . When distributed over the World Wide Web using formats such as VRML ( Virtual Reality Markup Lan - guage ) , MetaStream , or streaming video , virtual pro - totypes allow potential customers to experience the “look and feel” of multiple designs before physical versions are built ( cf . Dahan and Srinivasan 2000 ) . Consumer preference , price sensitivity , and demand data may be collected cost - effectively in this way at the earliest stages of NPD . How will more efﬁcient methods of concept gen - eration and testing affect R & D budgets and alloca - tions to concept testing during NPD ? The present analysis yields the insight that the optimal response to improved concept testing varies greatly based not only upon traditional measures of proﬁt uncertainty such as variance , but also upon the upper tail - shape of that uncertainty . Consider two potential beneﬁts of declining testing costs : savings on total development expense , or incremental proﬁt deriving from addi - tional concept tests . Importantly , the research suggests that “fatter” tails in the proﬁt distribution shift the optimal emphasis away from savings and towards additional testing . How might managers measure the “fatness” of upside proﬁt uncertainty ? The paper sug - gests several sources of data to inform the analysis and illustrates , through an example , an estimation approach using XTREMES software . 104 Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 1 , January 2001 DAHAN AND MENDELSON An Extreme - Value Model of Concept Testing In summary , the present research contributes to the existing literature by demonstrating the relevance of extreme - value theory to the concept phase of NPD , identifying and estimating a new class of decision - relevant data ( namely the tail - shape of proﬁt uncer - tainty ) , and optimizing concept testing based on the theory . The key concepts are illustrated through an example in which a ﬁrm develops several new products . The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows . Section 2 employs an example to illustrate decisions managers face during the fuzzy front end of NPD and suggests estimation procedures decision makers might utilize to characterize proﬁt uncertainty . Sec - tion 3 lays out a model of optimal concept generation and testing , and § 4 discusses the resource - allocation results derived from the model . Section 5 concludes and summarizes key managerial implications . 2 . Example : Inhale Therapeutic Systems , Inc . To highlight the problem of allocating testing resources under various forms of upside proﬁt uncer - Table 1 Inhale’s Systems Comprise Three NPD Efforts tainty , consider Inhale Therapeutic Systems , Inc . ( http : / / www . inhale . com ) , which was founded in 1990 to commercialize a new system of delivering protein - and peptide - based drugs , such as insulin , to the deep lung . A signiﬁcant amount of venture capital was raised , primarily to fund the extensive R & D and testing that would be required to gain FDA approval and demonstrate the medical beneﬁts and feasibility of new drug delivery systems . Allocating concept - testing resources optimally across NPD projects posed a challenge to the ﬁrm’s management . Because of time - to - market pressures , Inhale’s management was open to the idea of testing multiple product concepts in parallel . Delivering drugs to the deep lung through inhala - tion provides an attractive alternative to subcu - taneous or intravenous injection for protein - based drugs that cannot be taken orally since they would be broken down by the digestive system before entering the blood stream . The market for inhalable protein - based medicines represents a multibillion dol - lar opportunity . As Table 1 illustrates , deep - lung drug delivery for each drug requires three parallel product develop - Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 1 , January 2001 105 DAHAN AND MENDELSON An Extreme - Value Model of Concept Testing ment efforts : ( 1 ) dry powder formulation , including the choice of excipient to be combined with the drug molecule to make it inhalable , ( 2 ) processing and packaging of the powder to deliver the proper dosage at low cost , and ( 3 ) design of the delivery device to be used by patients to inhale the powder cloud . For each pharmaceutical , Inhale could choose to develop one , two , or all three components of the drug - delivery system . Depending on relative exper - tise and competencies among its partner drug ﬁrms , it could make more sense for Inhale to delegate devel - opment of some components to an outside group . Our example assumes that inhalable drug - delivery com - ponents are being developed for multiple drugs , i . e . , the excipient / formulation is being developed is for Drug A , packaging for Drug B , and the device for Drug C . Based on historical proﬁt data , management esti - mates about costs , and simulations of device adop - tion , proﬁt uncertainty is summarized in Appendix A . To estimate the shape and scale of proﬁt uncertainty based on the data , we employ the software pack - age XTREMES ( see http : / / www . xtremes . math . uni - siegen . de ) , which uses numerical optimization to ﬁnd the Maximum Likelihood Estimates ( MLE ) for the tail - shape , mean , and scale parameters of an extreme - value distribution . For each data set , we perform like - lihood ratio tests for the null hypothesis that the data comes from the Gumbel distribution , versus the alter - native hypothesis that the data are distributed accord - ing to some other extreme - value distribution . The resulting estimates reveal that the expected proﬁts for excipient concepts are estimated to be distributed according to the Frechet ( fat - tailed ) distribution , those Figure 1 Model of Parallel Concept Testing . for processing and packing conform to a Weibull dis - tribution , and those for the device correspond to a Gumbel distribution . Inhale’s management seeks to maximize expected proﬁtability by deciding how many concepts to gener - ate and test for each of the three system components . In this example , three simplifying assumptions are justiﬁed : ( 1 ) the proﬁtability of each of the three sub - systems is assumed to be independent , ( 2 ) all concepts are tested in parallel ( i . e . , there is no cross - learning ) because of the time constraint , and ( 3 ) the total cost of testing is linear in the number of concepts tested . Clearly , Inhale’s situation is far more complex , but as our focus is on the relationship between concept test - ing and the shape of proﬁt uncertainty , these simpli - ﬁcations are appropriate . Section 3 now proposes a model of parallel testing that offers insight into the testing decision . 3 . Model of Parallel Concept Testing Our model of parallel concept testing , depicted in Figure 1 , rests on the following assumptions : Expected Proﬁts From Concepts Are i . i . d . New product concepts yield expected proﬁts that are inde - pendently and identically distributed . This is justiﬁed by the idea that proﬁt is an outcome that depends on independently distributed underlying random vari - ables , each representing some form of technical , mar - keting , or managerial uncertainty , and that concepts are generated and tested independently . Best Subconcepts Are Considered Before Being Proposed . For any particular new product concept , 106 Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 1 , January 2001 DAHAN AND MENDELSON An Extreme - Value Model of Concept Testing design decisions for that concept are made so as to maximize proﬁtability before being proposed for test - ing . Thus , each proposed concept is the most prof - itable , or “best” of a possible set of subconcepts . Distribution Parameters Are Unique to Firm and Product Category . The parameters of the proﬁt prob - ability distribution depend upon the particular ﬁrm and product category under consideration and also upon ﬁrm - speciﬁc assets such as concept - testing capa - bility . Cost per Concept Is Constant . Each concept costs c to develop and test . The model applies to situations in which multiple concepts are tested similarly , such as through repeated customer or technical tests . Testing costs that are independent of the number of concepts tested are not included in c , but rather are subsumed in the location parameter of the proﬁt distribution , x 0 . The Number of Concepts Is Decided Up Front . The design team determines how many concepts to test independently of observed outcomes , consistent with situations in which resources are allocated before test results are observed . The Most Proﬁtable Concept Is Launched . The expected proﬁt realized is the expected highest draw from the proﬁt distribution . 3 . 1 . General Model of Parallel Concept Testing We model the concept phase of NPD as uncertain search informed by test outcomes . A concept test con - sists of specifying the details of a product or pro - cess , measuring its performance ( testing ) on one or more dimensions , and translating that measurement into an expected proﬁt outcome . Concept tests can be characterized by three parameters : • the cost per test ( c ) , • the scale of potential proﬁt uncertainty ( b ) , a mea - sure of variance , and • the “fatness” of the upper tail of proﬁt uncer - tainty (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3) . Consider a simple model of concept testing in which a ﬁnite number , n , of concepts are tested in parallel , and the best outcome is chosen ( Srinivasan et al . 1997 ) . Let each test cost c and have independent proﬁt outcomes , denoted by x i (cid:4)i = 1 (cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5) (cid:4)n , that are observed at the conclusion of each test . The x i s are i . i . d . random variables distributed as a random vari - able X with probability distribution F(cid:1)x(cid:3) , that cap - tures expected proﬁts ( e . g . , because of aesthetics , ease - of - use , performance , unit cost ) ; the values of the x i s are revealed at the conclusion of the n parallel con - cept tests . A potential extension to this model would allow for outcomes that cannot be observed deter - ministically , as in Gross ( 1967 ) and Loch et al . ( 1999 ) . The assumption that tests provide perfect informa - tion about design - speciﬁc outcomes may be relaxed by noting that if x i represents the expected value of proﬁt for design i , our analysis still holds . The value of x i reﬂects the net present value of incremental gross proﬁts resulting from launching design i , net of all costs other than those of testing . Hence , X captures the variability of potential design - speciﬁc market or technology outcomes . The parameters of the distribu - tion of X derive from uncertainty about proﬁt and are speciﬁc to the ﬁrm and product category . The choices made by the ﬁrm are shown in Figure 1 . In this simpliﬁed model , testing offers one key beneﬁt : The expected value of the highest observed proﬁt , E(cid:6)(cid:7) n (cid:8) , increases as additional concepts are explored . A ﬁrm has to decide on n ∗ , the optimal number of concepts to generate and test so as to maximize its expected net proﬁt . As concepts cost c each , deduct - ing the total cost , n × c , from gross proﬁt determines net proﬁt . After the expected proﬁtability of each of the n concepts is revealed , the ﬁrm develops the one with the highest expected proﬁt . We treat the number of parallel concept tests , n , as a continuous decision variable ( even though it would be integer - valued in actuality ) . The cumulative distribution function of the max - imum outcome of n independent tests is (cid:6)F(cid:1)x(cid:3)(cid:8) n , and the corresponding density function is n · f(cid:1)x(cid:3) · (cid:6)F(cid:1)x(cid:3)(cid:8) n − 1 . The expected proﬁt from testing n con - cepts ( assuming that the best outcome is ultimately launched ) , is given by E(cid:6)(cid:7) n (cid:8) = n (cid:1) (cid:2) −(cid:2) x · (cid:6)F(cid:1)x(cid:3)(cid:8) n − 1 · f(cid:1)x(cid:3)dx − c · n(cid:5) ( 1 ) When the objective Function ( 1 ) is strictly concave in n , the globally optimal number of concept tests , n ∗ , is determined by differentiating E(cid:6)(cid:7) n (cid:8) with respect to n Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 1 , January 2001 107 DAHAN AND MENDELSON An Extreme - Value Model of Concept Testing and solving the ﬁrst - order condition , (cid:1) (cid:2) −(cid:2) (cid:6)n · ln F(cid:1)x(cid:3) + 1 (cid:8) · x · (cid:6)F(cid:1)x(cid:3)(cid:8) n − 1 · f(cid:1)x(cid:3)dx = c(cid:4) ( 2 ) which equates the marginal beneﬁt of the n th draw with its marginal cost . We note that the solution to Equation ( 2 ) depends on the ratio between c and the scale of X , hence n ∗ does not change when X and c are both scaled by a constant . The optimality condition implies : (cid:9)E(cid:6)(cid:7) n ∗ (cid:1)n ∗ (cid:1)c(cid:3)(cid:4)c(cid:3)(cid:8) (cid:9)c = (cid:9)E(cid:6)(cid:7) n ∗ (cid:1)n ∗ (cid:1)c(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:8) (cid:9)n · (cid:9)n ∗ (cid:1)c(cid:3) (cid:9)c + (cid:9)E(cid:6)(cid:7) n ∗ (cid:1)c(cid:3)(cid:8) (cid:9)c = − n ∗ (cid:4) ( 3 ) since (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:9)E(cid:6)(cid:7) n ∗ (cid:1)n ∗ (cid:1)c(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:8)(cid:3) / (cid:9)n(cid:3) = 0 at n ∗ . Since n ∗ > 0 for any test worth running , (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:9)E(cid:6)(cid:7) n ∗ (cid:8)(cid:3) / (cid:9)c(cid:3) < 0 , so Equation ( 3 ) demonstrates that a ( small ) reduction in unit testing cost impacts proﬁt by n ∗ , the number of tests . That is , if the cost for each test is cut by one dol - lar , and if n ∗ remains ( approximately ) the same , the overall cost reduction will be n ∗ . 3 . 2 . Real Option When the option to abandon product launch is not available , Equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) apply . However , if the proﬁt distribution F(cid:1)x(cid:3) allows negative outcomes ( i . e . , losses ) , then even the best of n ∗ draws may be negative , an event that occurs with probability F(cid:1) 0 (cid:3) n ∗ . In that instance , the ﬁrm beneﬁts from retaining the option to abandon product launch at the concept - selection phase . The option to abandon may not be available if : ( a ) the ﬁrm is contractually obligated to deliver , ( b ) the product is a required component of a larger system , or ( c ) the ﬁrm preannounced the launch , thus creating an implicit contract with its customers . Also , personal incentives on the part of individual decision - makers may preclude the aban - donment option from being exercised , even when that choice might be optimal for the ﬁrm . In cases where potential losses are small or unlikely , the option to abandon is virtually worthless , in which case early commitment to launch may provide a strategic advantage . The expected proﬁt from n tests given the option to abandon , E(cid:6)(cid:7) optionn ] , is given by : E(cid:6)(cid:7) optionn (cid:8) = E(cid:6) max (cid:1) 0 (cid:4)X 1 (cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5) (cid:4)X n ∗ (cid:3)(cid:8) − c · n = n · (cid:1) (cid:2) 0 x · (cid:6)F(cid:1)x(cid:3)(cid:8) n − 1 · f(cid:1)x(cid:3)dx − c · n(cid:5) ( 4 ) An assumption here is that testing costs are sunk at the time outcomes are observed . Note that E(cid:6)(cid:7) option n (cid:8) could be negative for all n , in which case the ﬁrm should abandon product development before concept generation . Given that the ﬁrm conducts n tests , the value of the abandonment option is given by the dif - ference between ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) , E(cid:6)(cid:7) optionn (cid:8) − E(cid:6)(cid:7) n (cid:8) = − (cid:1) 0 −(cid:2) x · n · (cid:6)F(cid:1)x(cid:3)(cid:8) n − 1 · f(cid:1)x(cid:3)dx(cid:4) ( 5 ) which is the mean minimum loss , given that all n out - comes are negative , weighted by the corresponding probability of that event , i . e . , the probability - weighted loss that is being avoided . Clearly , the option value at the optimum requires a comparison of E(cid:6)(cid:7) optionn ∗∗ (cid:8) and E(cid:6)(cid:7) n ∗ (cid:8) , where n ∗∗ max - imizes ( 4 ) . The difference between the two is higher than in Expression ( 5 ) with n = n ∗ since n ∗ maxi - mizes ( 1 ) , but is only a feasible solution to ( 4 ) . Hence , E(cid:1)(cid:7) n ∗ (cid:3) ≤ E(cid:1)(cid:7) optionn ∗ (cid:3) ≤ E(cid:1)(cid:7) optionn ∗∗ (cid:3) . 3 . 3 . Extreme - Value Theory Model of Concept Testing This section applies the statistical theory of extreme values to new product concept testing . The distri - bution F(cid:1)x(cid:3) , which characterizes the design - speciﬁc proﬁt uncertainty , is determined by the process depicted in the ﬁrst two boxes of Figure 1 . As described in Chapter 6 of Ulrich and Eppinger ( 2000 , p . 108 ) , “an effective development team will generate hundreds of concepts , of which 5 to 20 will merit seri - ous consideration during the concept selection activ - ity . ” Hence , we model F(cid:1)x(cid:3) as a distribution over product concepts , each of which is the maximum of a larger subset of product possibilities drawn from a general underlying proﬁt distribution , H(cid:1)x(cid:3) . In our model , the proﬁt of the product concept chosen for launch is the maximum of the sample proﬁts . When the maximum is taken over a large number of i . i . d . random variables , its asymptotic distribution is given 108 Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 1 , January 2001 DAHAN AND MENDELSON An Extreme - Value Model of Concept Testing by extreme - value theory ( cf . Gumbel 1958 , Galambos 1978 ) . The following theorem summarizes the perti - nent results . Theorem 1 ( Galambos 1978 ) . Let H(cid:1)x(cid:3) be a distri - bution function from which m independent draws are taken . Then lim m →(cid:2) H m (cid:1)x(cid:3) , the limiting distribution of the maximum of m draws from H(cid:1)x(cid:3) , converges to one of three distributions ( with properly chosen a m and b m ) or to none at all : F mI (cid:1)x(cid:3) = e − (cid:2) x − x 0 bm (cid:3) − (cid:2) iff lim t →(cid:2) 1 − H(cid:1)tx(cid:3) 1 − H(cid:1)t(cid:3) = x − (cid:2) for some (cid:2) ∈ (cid:1) 0 (cid:4) (cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:4) ( 6 ) F mII (cid:1)x(cid:3) = e − (cid:2) x 0 − x bm (cid:3) (cid:2) iff lim t → 0 1 − H(cid:1)x 0 − tx(cid:3) 1 − H(cid:1)x 0 − t(cid:3) = x (cid:2) for some (cid:2) ∈ (cid:1) 0 (cid:4) (cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:4) or ( 7 ) F mIII (cid:1)x(cid:3) = e − e − x − ambm iff lim t →(cid:2) 1 − H(cid:1)t + xR(cid:1)t(cid:3)(cid:3) 1 − H(cid:1)t(cid:3) = e − x (cid:4) where R(cid:1)t(cid:3) = 1 1 − H(cid:1)t(cid:3) (cid:1) (cid:2) t 1 − H(cid:1)x(cid:3)dx(cid:5) ( 8 ) We assume that H(cid:1)x(cid:3) , the underlying proﬁt distri - bution for the universe of possible concepts , satisﬁes one of the limits in ( 6 ) – ( 8 ) . Appendix B summarizes the three extreme - value distributions , provides their means and variances , and demonstrates their closed - ness under maximization , meaning that the highest of n draws from F i (cid:1)x(cid:3)(cid:4)i = I(cid:4)II(cid:4)III is also distributed F i (cid:1)x(cid:3) with modiﬁed parameters . Since product ideas that are good enough to make it onto Figure 1’s Figure 2 Densities for the Three Extreme Value Distributions (cid:1)(cid:2) = 0 (cid:3)(cid:4) 2 = 1 (cid:5) . “short list” are each a maximum from a large sam - ple of subconcepts drawn from H(cid:1)x(cid:3) , F(cid:1)x(cid:3) also takes the form of one of the three extreme - value distribu - tions . Appendix C summarizes the appropriate limit tests and distribution parameters connecting a given underlying distribution to its limiting extreme - value distribution . The three extreme - value distributions can be uni - ﬁed under a single continuous model ( von Mises 1936 ) F(cid:1)x(cid:3) = e − (cid:1) 1 + x(cid:2) (cid:3) − (cid:2) (cid:4) ( 9 ) where the distribution is Frechet if (cid:2) > 0 , Weibull if (cid:2) < 0 , and Gumbel as (cid:6) (cid:2) (cid:6) → (cid:2) . This last fact suggests that for sufﬁciently large (cid:6) (cid:2) (cid:6) , the optimal parallel test - ing results for the Gumbel distribution apply broadly . The parameter (cid:2) captures the “fatness” of the upper tail of the proﬁt distribution . Our analysis reveals that lower absolute values of (cid:2) lead to widely dif - ferent optimal policies , but the convergence , for sufﬁ - ciently large (cid:6) (cid:2) (cid:6) , of all extreme - value distributions to the Gumbel distribution suggests that it merits spe - cial attention . The three extreme - value distributions , normalized to zero mean and unit variance , are shown in Figure 2 and interpreted in the context of NPD below . We note the pronounced variation in the upper quantiles of the three distributions , as exempliﬁed by the 99th - percentile stars in Figure 2 . Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 1 , January 2001 109 DAHAN AND MENDELSON An Extreme - Value Model of Concept Testing Frechet . Consider a product category with great upside uncertainty such as a new pharmaceutical or paradigm - shifting consumer durable . In such cases , products may become “mega - hits , ” accounting for the vast majority of the ﬁrm’s proﬁts . This may be due to network externality and dominant - design effects , resulting in random variables that may be highly cor - related in their effect on proﬁt . In the Inhale example , the choice of excipient and drug formulation is char - acterized by “fat - tailed” proﬁt uncertainty because it determines medical effectiveness and the number of candidate drugs that are compatible with the Inhale system . When the gross proﬁt distribution has a fat tail ( e . g . , when F(cid:1)x(cid:3) declines as x − (cid:2) ) , the Frechet dis - tribution applies with higher values of (cid:2) denoting “thinner” upper tails . The gross proﬁts from each test are then distributed over an interval (cid:6)x 0 (cid:4) (cid:2) (cid:8) . As shown in Appendix C , the Frechet distribution has inﬁnite mean when 0 < (cid:2) ≤ 1 . Hence , we assume throughout that (cid:2) > 1 . Weibull . Some ﬁrms face predictably ﬁnite bounds on the upside proﬁt potential of a new product due to limited market potential , price ceilings , or ﬁxed - price contracts . Such might be the case for a prod - uct that serves a small market , upgrades an existing user base , conforms to a ﬁxed - price contract , or is capacity - constrained . In the Inhale example , the cost containment aspect of packaging and process exem - pliﬁes bounded upside proﬁt . When the gross proﬁt is upper - bounded , the Weibull distribution applies . The gross proﬁts from each test are distributed over an interval (cid:6) −(cid:2) (cid:4)x 0 (cid:8) , where x 0 > 0 . Gumbel . In many industries , there are no speciﬁc limits on the gross proﬁt potential from a new prod - uct , but proﬁt outcomes outside of a central range are extremely unlikely . Established products such as automobiles , food staples , or commodities are only partially constrained by production capacity or mar - ket potential limits , but nevertheless tend towards proﬁt performance with central tendency . The Inhale device represents such uncertainty because proﬁt out - comes for any particular concept depend on multiple random outcomes each of which is normally dis - tributed . When gross proﬁt is unbounded from above , but with exponentially declining probability den - sity , an extreme - value distribution with exponential tails is appropriate . The Gumbel distribution is the asymptotic distribution for the maximum of multiple draws from exponential - tailed distributions such as the normal . We next evaluate ( 1 ) – ( 5 ) and obtain closed - form solutions for n ∗ for the three extreme - value distributions . 4 . Results and Analysis 4 . 1 . Optimal Number of Tests In this section , we derive closed - form solutions to § 3’s model for the Frechet , Weibull , and Gumbel distribu - tions , and then apply these to Inhale therapeutic sys - tems example of § 2 . The key results for the Frechet , Weibull , and Gumbel distributions are summarized in Table 2 . In the table , x 0 is the location parameter of the distribu - tion , b is its scale parameter which varies monotoni - cally with variance , and (cid:2) is the tail - shape parameter . As before , c is the unit cost per concept test and x is the random variable for expected proﬁt outcomes . It is easily shown that the objective functions are strictly concave , i . e . , (cid:1)(cid:10) 2 E(cid:6)(cid:7) n (cid:8) / (cid:10)n 2 (cid:3) < 0 , for all three extreme - value distributions ( here we use the assumption made earlier that (cid:2) > 1 for the Frechet ) so that the n ∗ s shown in the table are globally optimal . The ﬁrst row of the table simply applies ( 1 ) using the three distribution functions to calculate the expected value of the most proﬁtable of n concepts , net of the total cost of testing . In the second row , the optimal number of concepts is calculated . Under the Gumbel distribution , the remarkably simple expres - sion , n ∗ = b c ( 10 ) is intuitively appealing , in that either greater proﬁt uncertainty or lower testing costs drive increased con - cept testing . We note that the optimal number of con - cepts for all of three distributions are a function of b / c , the ratio of the scale of proﬁt uncertainty to the cost per concept and are independent of x 0 , the location parameter of the distribution . Therefore , as pointed out in § 3 , shifting the proﬁt distribution or 110 Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 1 , January 2001 DAHAN AND MENDELSON An Extreme - Value Model of Concept Testing Figure 3 Inhale’s Optimal Number of Concepts as Unit Testing Costs Decrease . Note . Distributions have zero mean and unit variance . scaling b and c by a constant does not change the results . The n ∗ th concept has an expected marginal beneﬁt exactly equal to the cost of that concept , c . As the cost per concept test , c , declines , proﬁt increases , (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:9)E(cid:6)(cid:7) n ∗ (cid:8)(cid:3) / (cid:9)c(cid:3) = − n ∗ < 0 , consistent with ( 3 ) and the optimal number of tests increases , (cid:9)n ∗ / (cid:9)c < 0 , as com - mon sense dictates . Also , (cid:9)n ∗ / (cid:9)(cid:2) < 0 ( not applicable in the Gumbel case ) since a higher value of (cid:2) implies a “thinner” tail for the Frechet distribution and a tighter upper bound for the Weibull . Returning to the Inhale example , we can now calcu - late the optimal number of tests for excipient , packag - ing , and device based on the three standardized ( zero mean , unit variance ) proﬁt distributions we estimated earlier . Figure 3 applies the results in the second row of Table 2 and depicts the optimal number of concepts to be tested as unit testing cost varies . Here the units for the x - axis are dollars per concept test , so that , for example , if the unit cost were 0 . 1 , the opti - Table 2 Summary of Results for the Three Extreme - Value Distributions Frechet Weibull Gumbel Objective n(cid:6) b (cid:1) (cid:2) x 0 x · (cid:4) x − x 0 b (cid:5) − (cid:6) − 1 e − n (cid:2) x − x 0 b (cid:3) − (cid:6) dx − n · c n(cid:6) b (cid:1) x 0 −(cid:2) x · (cid:4) x 0 − x b (cid:5) − (cid:6) − 1 e − n (cid:2) x 0 − x b (cid:3) − (cid:6) dx − n · c x 0 + b ln n + b(cid:7) − n · c Function : E(cid:8)(cid:9) n (cid:10) Optimal # of (cid:6) b c(cid:6)(cid:11) (cid:4) (cid:6) − 1 (cid:6) (cid:5)(cid:7) (cid:1)(cid:6) / (cid:1)(cid:6) − 1 (cid:5)(cid:5) (cid:6) b c(cid:6)(cid:11) (cid:4) (cid:6) + 1 (cid:6) (cid:5)(cid:7) (cid:6)(cid:6) + 1 b c Concepts : n ∗ Effect of lower c on Convex increasing Concave decreasing Constant spending T = n ∗ × c Option − x 0 e − n(cid:1) − x 0 / b(cid:5) − (cid:6) − bn 1 / (cid:6) (cid:11) (cid:4) (cid:6) − 1 (cid:6) (cid:3)n · (cid:4) − x 0 b (cid:5) − (cid:6) (cid:5) − x 0 e − n(cid:1)x 0 / b(cid:5)(cid:6) + bn − 1 / (cid:6) (cid:11) (cid:4) (cid:6) + 1 (cid:6) (cid:3)n · (cid:4) x 0 b (cid:5) (cid:6) (cid:5) (cid:8) − b · Ei (cid:9) − ne x 0 / b (cid:10)(cid:11) Value mal number of concept tests would be 11 , 8 , and 5 for excipient , device , and process , respectively . For testing costs above c = 0 (cid:5) 5 , all three components of the Inhale system should have only a single concept tested , but below c = 0 (cid:5) 25 the optimal number of con - cepts increases and diverges greatly . 4 . 2 . Effect of Unit Testing Costs on Total Spending Figure 4 shows the effect of declining unit testing costs on total concept test spending , using the same x - axis units as in Figure 3 , for the three components of Inhale’s system . . As shown in Figure 4 , holding mean and variance constant , total spending depends on the tail - shape (cid:2) of the distribution of X , not just on the cost per test , c . We note the reversal of total spend - ing rankings when c ≤ 0 (cid:5) 25 against those for c ≥ 0 (cid:5) 5 (cid:5) This reversal in total spending highlights the interac - tion between tail - shape , (cid:2) , and unit testing cost , c , in determining total spending on concept testing . Clearly , the cost per concept may decline over time as a result of technological innovations such as the use of Web - based concept tests and combinatorial meth - ods . Firms can take advantage of declines in unit testing costs either by increasing the number of con - cepts tested or by reducing total testing expense . The choice of which path to follow depends directly on the tail - shape parameter , (cid:2) , of the distribution , i . e . , on the nature of upside proﬁt uncertainty . Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 1 , January 2001 111 DAHAN AND MENDELSON An Extreme - Value Model of Concept Testing Figure 4 Total Cost of Concept Testing as Testing Costs Decrease . Note . Distributions have zero mean and unit variance . Let T = n ∗ × c , the optimal total spending on con - cept tests . In the Frechet case , reducing the unit test - ing cost increases optimal total expenditures , (cid:9)T / (cid:9)c < 0 when (cid:2) > 1 ( which is consistent with our ear - lier assumption of ﬁnite mean ) , in a convex fashion , i . e . , (cid:9) 2 T / (cid:9)c 2 > 0 . In other words , the ﬁrm’s demand for testing is elastic when proﬁts follow a Frechet distribution . This behavior contrasts with total expenditures for the Weibull and Gumbel proﬁt distributions as depicted in Figure 4 . In the Weibull case , the induced demand for testing is inelastic , as declining unit testing costs concavely reduce optimal total expendi - tures , that is , (cid:9)T / (cid:9)c > 0 and (cid:9) 2 T / (cid:9)c 2 < 0 . Intuitively , since Weibull - regime ﬁrms are constrained in their upside proﬁt potential , the marginal beneﬁts of addi - tional tests are small , hence total spending declines as testing costs drop . In the Gumbel case , reducing the unit testing cost has no effect on total spending (cid:1)(cid:9)T / (cid:9)c = 0 (cid:3) since total spending stays constant at b , the scale parameter of the distribution . Thus , the induced demand for testing has unit elasticity in the Gumbel case . Importantly , ﬁrms that ﬁx R & D spending during a regime of high testing costs ( e . g . , when c > 0 (cid:5) 5 ) may be caught with suboptimal testing capacity when those costs decline , especially if upside uncertainty is fat - tailed . As the absolute value of the tail - shape parameter , (cid:2) , increases , the Frechet and Weibull distributions con - verge to the Gumbel , consistent with the discussion of Equation ( 9 ) . Thus , the optimal number of paral - lel tests and the expected proﬁts resulting from run - ning them also converge to the Gumbel result as (cid:6) (cid:2) (cid:6) increases . For lower values of (cid:6) (cid:2) (cid:6) , however , the three distributions diverge greatly in their proﬁt implica - tions and in their optimal number of tests , particularly when testing costs are low . Holding mean and vari - ance constant , lower (cid:6) (cid:2) (cid:6) values imply fatter tails in the case of the Frechet distribution and tighter upper bounds in the Weibull case . Thus , the upper tail - shape of the proﬁt distribution , as parameterized by (cid:2) , plays a pivotal role in determining the optimal testing pol - icy and the expected proﬁt that results from following that policy . The ratio of proﬁt uncertainty to cost per test and the tail - shape of the distribution underlying innova - tive uncertainty are key drivers . As shown in Figure 3 , lower testing costs convexly increase the optimal number of tests . The degree of this effect hinges on the upper - tail parameter , with Frechet distribution scenarios beneﬁting the most from unit cost reduc - tions . The dramatic differences between the num - ber of Frechet , Gumbel , and Weibull tests , especially when the cost per test is low , illustrate the importance of estimating (cid:2) , the tail - shape parameter . 4 . 3 . Option Value Results Deriving the objective function as in ( 4 ) , with the option to abandon , yields the results in the last row of Table 2 . Obviously , the option to abandon is only relevant when the lower bound in the Frechet distri - bution is negative (cid:1)x 0 < 0 (cid:3) because otherwise losses could never arise , or when the upper bound is pos - itive under the Weibull distribution , that is , when x 0 > 0 , because only then are proﬁts even possible and concept tests worth running . The option values shown can be interpreted as the probability - weighted loss that would be avoided given that the option to abandon needed to be exercised . In particular , as the downside risk increases ( i . e . , as x 0 decreases and losses become more likely ) , the option values increase . In the Gumbel case , including the option to abandon if the best of n concepts loses money , yields : E (cid:12) (cid:7) optn (cid:13) = x 0 + b ln n + b(cid:11) − cn + (cid:12) − b · Ei (cid:2) − ne x 0 / b (cid:3)(cid:13) (cid:4) ( 11 ) 112 Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 1 , January 2001 DAHAN AND MENDELSON An Extreme - Value Model of Concept Testing where Ei ( y ) is the exponential integral function , − Ei (cid:1)y(cid:3) = (cid:14) y −(cid:2) (cid:1)e − y / y(cid:3)dy . Given that n tests are con - ducted , the value of the option to abandon is (cid:6) − b · Ei (cid:1) − ne x 0 / b (cid:3)(cid:8) , which can be interpreted as follows . For negative values of y(cid:4) − Ei (cid:1)y(cid:3) is always positive and decreases in (cid:6) y (cid:6) . Thus , as ne x 0 / b increases , (cid:6) − b · Ei (cid:1) − ne x 0 / b (cid:3)(cid:8) stays positive , but decreases in magni - tude . Indeed , the option to abandon has the great - est value when only a few tests are conducted ( low n ) , when uncertainty is very high ( high b ) , or when mean proﬁt is low ( low x 0 ) . When many tests are run ( high n ) , and high proﬁts ( high x 0 ) are relatively cer - tain ( low b ) , the option value approaches zero , as one might expect . Comparative statics on the option value ﬁt our intuition . As proﬁt variability , b , increases , so does the optimal number of tests , since the possibility of at least one very high outcome increases and we must remember that only the highest outcome mat - ters . As the location parameter of the distribution , x 0 , increases so does the optimal number of tests because downside costs are less likely . Without the option , upward or downward shifts in the distribution ( i . e . , changes to x 0 ) have no effect on n ∗ . 5 . Concluding Remarks We have quantiﬁed the costs and expected bene - ﬁts of conducting parallel concept tests at the fuzzy front end of NPD . Our contributions include cal - culating the optimal number of parallel concept tests , valuing the real option to abandon launch , highlighting the varying impact of lower testing costs on total spending , and identifying the piv - otal role played by the tail - shape parameter . Our model applies the statistical theory of extreme val - ues to quantify the effects of optimal testing policies . We demonstrate the profoundly differing implications of exploring new product concepts under Frechet - , Gumbel - and Weibull - distributed proﬁts . Holding means , variances , and costs constant , we show that the upper tail - shape of the distribution drives the number of tests , the allocation of total spending , and the resulting expected proﬁt . The tail - shape parameter (cid:2) can be estimated using the methods of Reiss and Thomas ( 1997 ) , who ﬁt observed maxima to the three extreme - value distri - butions , just as we did for Drug A’s excipient and formulation in the Inhale example . Another approach would be to simulate data on the potential proﬁt out - comes from the underlying proﬁt distribution , H(cid:1)x(cid:3) , as we did for Drug C’s device in the Inhale exam - ple . Alternatively , given that the choice of a family of distributions determines the qualitative results , man - agers can subjectively classify the uncertainty about potential upside outcomes for different product types based on prior experience and speciﬁc knowledge using , for example , quantile estimates as was the case for Inhale’s process and packaging of Drug B . When the parameters of the proﬁt distributions are unknown , the outcomes of the experiments could be used to update those parameters , leading to a multi - arm bandit - type problem . Future research could examine the optimal joint determination of the parameters and the testing policy . Managers’ knowledge of the upper tail - shape of the proﬁt distribution should guide their response to declining testing costs . Lower unit testing costs under a bounded proﬁt distribution lead to reduc - tions in total spending ; the ﬁrm takes the money and runs . In contrast , declining unit testing costs under a fat - tailed proﬁt distribution may lead to increases in total spending on concept tests . The fact that , holding mean and variance constant , optimal concept test spending diverges signiﬁcantly based on the tail - shape parameter ( cf . Figure 4 ) highlights the impor - tance of carefully managing NPD projects based on the nature of the uncertainty they resolve . Our results show that two key drivers determine the optimal level of parallel concept testing : The Ratio of Proﬁt Uncertainty to Cost per Test ( b / c ) : Higher proﬁt uncertainty and lower testing costs increase the number of concept tests and expected proﬁt . Product categories with fat upper tails beneﬁt most from unit cost reductions due to their higher probability of generating breakthrough proﬁts , suggesting that ﬁrms focus cost reduction efforts on methods that explore innovative , higher - risk products and processes . The “Fatness” of the Upper Tail of Innovative Uncertainty ( (cid:2) ) : Dramatic differences between the Management Science / Vol . 47 , No . 1 , January 2001 113 DAHAN AND MENDELSON An Extreme - Value Model of Concept Testing optimal number of Frechet , Gumbel , and Weibull tests underscore the importance of the tail - shape parame - ter . These differences become more apparent under a low testing cost regime . Declining testing costs should result in increased testing of product concepts with so - called “fat - tailed” proﬁt uncertainty . Our results have several implications for improv - ing NPD practice . Firms should : ( 1 ) evaluate a new product opportunity not only in terms of its expected proﬁt and variance , but also based on the shape of its upside uncertainty , ( 2 ) seek out new meth - ods of NPD testing that lower the cost of explor - ing many high - risk , high - proﬁt designs , ( 3 ) wisely exploit declining costs of concept testing by spend - ing more total dollars on high - risk , high - upside NPD product categories while lowering expenditures on categories with bounded upside potential , ( 4 ) retain the option to abandon product launch when down - side risks outweigh the beneﬁts of early commitment , ( 5 ) increase internal testing capacity through paral - lel testing , higher investment in R & D , or improved efﬁciency and effectiveness , and ( 6 ) expand external testing capacity by outsourcing , engaging suppliers , or facilitating user design by customers . The issue of increased internal and external concept testing capac - ity suggests the need for further research regarding implementation and execution . Most importantly , ﬁrms should keep a close eye on the dramatic technological changes that improve Appendix A .

Even when test - ing methods experience the same proportional decline in costs , their relative attractiveness shifts dramati - cally depending on the upside proﬁt opportunities they measure . Considering that concept tests are rel - atively cheap , but have high leverage on later , much more expensive phases of product development , it becomes especially important for ﬁrms to seek out the most effective , low - cost methods to enhance innovation . The trend towards lower unit costs per test is fueled by investment in technologies such as virtual design , rapid experimentation , combinatorial meth - ods , and automated processing . Lower unit costs may also derive from economies of scale inherent in parallel concept testing itself , since some costs may be ﬁxed . Recent work by Dahan and Srinivasan ( 2000 ) demonstrates that virtual prototypes on the Web result in market share predictions that are nearly identical to those for costlier physical prototypes . Virtual concept tests and other Web - based methods ( e . g . , Dahan et al . 2000 and Chen et al . 2000 ) por - tend widespread growth in parallel concept testing driven by the desire to develop the most proﬁtable products .
