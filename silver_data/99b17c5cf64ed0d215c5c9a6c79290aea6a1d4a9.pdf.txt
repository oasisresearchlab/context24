Here we describe Lifeact , a 17 - amino - acid peptide , which stained ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) structures in eukaryotic cells and tissues . Lifeact did not interfere with actin dynamics in vitro and in vivo and in its chemically modiﬁed peptide form allowed visualization of actin dynamics in nontransfectable cells . Reliable visualization of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for various ﬁelds of biomedical research . Imaging of actin dynamics has been mostly achieved by injection of ﬂuorescently labeled actin ( technically demanding ) or small amounts of ﬂuorescently labeled phalloidin , an F - actin - binding and stabilizing compound 1 , 2 . A widely used alternative is the expression of actin - GFP fusion proteins . However , all described actin fusions are functionally impaired and rely on nontagged actin 3 to buffer the defects . Recently , fusions of GFP to actin - binding domains have been used , notably from moesin in Drosophila melanogaster 4 , LimE in Dictyostelium discoideum 5 , ABP120 in D . discoideum and mamma - lian cells 6 , 7 , and utrophin in Xenopus laevis 8 . These probes consist of large domains , compete with their endogenous counterparts and are restricted to cells that can be transfected . Abp140 - GFP is the only probe that has been successfully used to label actin cables , in budding yeast 9 , 10 . Using total internal reﬂection ( TIRF ) microscopy to monitor localization of Abp140 domains fused to GFP , we found that the ﬁrst 17 aa of Abp140 were sufﬁcient to mediate actin localization comparable to the full - length protein ( Fig . 1a , b ) . This short peptide is conserved among close relatives of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Fig . 1c ) but is absent from other organisms . This and its small size make it an attractive actin marker for higher eukaryotes . We therefore introduced the peptide , named ‘Lifeact’ , as a C - terminal GFP fusion ( Lifeact - GFP ) into mammalian cell lines to test its suitability as an in vivo marker . We also synthesized Lifeact with an N - terminal FITC ﬂuorophore ( F - Lifeact ) to test its biochemical properties .

NATURE METHODS | VOL . 5 NO . 7 | JULY 2008 | 605 BRIEF COMMUNICATIONS © 200 8 N a t u r e P ub li s h i ng G r oup h tt p : / / www . n a t u r e . c o m / n a t u r e m e t hod s To determine the afﬁnity of F - Lifeact to F - actin we measured the dissociation constant ( K d ) by co - sedimentation in the absence ( 2 . 2 ± 0 . 3 m M ; Fig . 1d ) and presence of 100 nM phalloidin ( 2 . 0 ± 0 . 4 m M ) . We then monitored F - Lifeact binding to globular actin ( G - actin ) by ﬂuorescence enhancement of pyrene - labeled actin ( Supplementary Methods online ) and found a 30 - fold higher K d of 70 ± 25 nM ( Fig . 1e ) . We conﬁrmed the afﬁnities to G - actin and F - actin using anisotropy ( 280 ± 100 nM , G - actin ; 2 . 3 ± 0 . 9 m M , F - actin ) and ﬂuorescence enhancement ( 40 ± 10 nM , G - actin ; 1 . 3 ± 0 . 5 m M , F - actin ) of the FITC moiety on F - Lifeact ( Supplementary Fig . 1a , b online ) . Addition of the G - actin – sequestering factors proﬁlin or latrunculin A did not perturb F - Lifeact binding to G - actin ( K d ¼ 40 ± 10 nM for both ; Fig . 1e ) indicating non - overlapping binding sites on actin . Next we tested the inﬂuence of F - Lifeact on polymerization and depolymerization of pyrene - labeled actin 11 . Nucleation and elongation phases of actin poly - merization , as well as deploymerization rates , were not affected by F - Lifeact concentrations up to 55 m M ( Fig . 1f , g ) . To test for competition of F - Lifeact with proteins binding to the sides of actin ﬁlaments , we co - pelleted myosin II and a - actinin with F - actin at different Lifeact concentrations ( 1 . 1 , 11 and 55 m M ) and found that both interactions remained unaffected ( Fig . 1h , i ) . Using circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies we found that Lifeact forms a nascent helix in water that can be stabilized by alcohol addition to a typical a helix at residues 2 – 10 ( Supplementary Fig . 1c , d ) . These structural features are reminis - cent of the G - actin – binding peptide thymosin b 412 . To test its suitability in vivo , we introduced Lifeact - GFP into immortalized mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts , MDCK cells , primary rat hippocampal neurons and primary mouse dendritic cells ( Fig . 2 ) . In all these cell types we obtained clear labeling of F - actin ( Fig . 2a – d ) that matched previously reported patterns . In ﬁbroblasts , Lifeact - GFP signal was comparable to staining obtained with actin - GFP or GFP - utrophin ( Fig . 2e ) , and in double - transfected MDCK cells Lifeact - GFPcompletelycolocalizedwithactin - mRFPruby 13 ( Fig . 2f ) . Consistent with its low afﬁnity to F - actin in vitro , Lifeact - GFP recovered rapidly in photobleaching experiments ( Fig . 2g ) , whereas actin - GFP showed the expected slower mobility ( Fig . 2h ) . We noted no signs of cytotoxicity , abnormal morphology or of growth retarda - tion in transiently or stably transfected cell lines ( data not shown ) . To test whether Lifeact - GFP selectively associates with subsets of actin structures , we used TIRF microscopy to image dynamic cortical F - actin . In ﬁbroblasts and dendritic cells , the ﬂow of dynamic lamellipodial actin was prominent at the cell periphery ( Fig . 2a , d , i and Supplementary Movies 1 and 2 online ) , but stable stress ﬁbers formed in the cell body of tightly adherent ﬁbroblasts ( Fig . 2a ) . Neurons were rich in dynamic ﬁlopodia ( Fig . 2b ) that frequently underwent kinking ( Fig . 2j and Supplementary Movie 3 online ) , and the surface of neuronal cell bodies was covered with an isotropic network of actin ﬁlaments ( Fig . 2b , o and Supplementary Movie 4 online ) . MDCK cells showed stress ﬁbers and circumfer - ential actin belts at the cell periphery ( Fig . 2c ) . During cytokinesis , Lifeact - GFP highlighted the typical contractile rings of MDCK cells ( Fig . 2k and Supplementary Movie 5 online ) . To test whether Lifeact - GFP compromises cytoskeletal functions , we measured three sensitive readouts for actin dynamics : retrograde ﬂow within the leading lamella of ﬁbroblasts , migration of dendritic cells along a gradient of chemokine and neuronal polarization . In all cases we compared Lifeact - GFP with actin - GFP expressed from the same vector . The speed of retrograde ﬂow in lamellipodia of Lifeact - GFP – transfected ﬁbroblasts was indistinguishable from that in un - transfected cells ( 4 m m / min ) , but it was reduced to about half in a b e i j k o f g l m n h c d 0 0 30 30 15 0 4 8 12 16 60 – 3 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 – 3 4 23 0 6 3 0 Strain Strain 1 axon > 1 axon No axons P e r c en t age o f c on t r o l P e r c en t age o f c e ll s 100 50 0 Control Lifeact - GFP Actin - GFP 100 50 0 A c t i n f l o w ( µ m / m i n ) Figure 2 | Characterization of Lifeact - GFP in vivo .

Lifeact - GFP also had no effect on the speed of chemotactic dendritic cell migration in a collagen matrix ( paired t - test , t 2 ¼ – 1 . 05 , P ¼ 0 . 40 , n ¼ 3 experiments , 837 tracked cells ) , but actin - GFP expressing cells migrated more slowly ( t 3 ¼ – 3 . 65 , P ¼ 0 . 04 , n ¼ 4 experiments , 689 cells ; Fig . 2m ) . Finally , neuronal polarization was not signiﬁcantly affected by the expression of Lifeact - GFP , whereas comparable expression of actin - GFP clearly reduced polarization efﬁciency ( ANOVA : F 2 , 8 ¼ 6 . 205 , P o 0 . 0346 ; post - hoc Dunnett’s test : P 4 0 . 05 for Lifeact - GFP , P o 0 . 05 for actin - GFP ; Fig . 2n ) . Chemically synthesized F - Lifeact could allow convenient labeling of ﬁxed samples or nontransfectable cells . We stained paraformal - dehyde - ﬁxed MDCK cells with F - Lifeact and Cy3 - conjugated phalloidin , and observed extensive overlap of the two markers ( Fig . 3a ) . We observed similar co - localization of these two labels in paraformaldehyde - ﬁxed tissue sections of mouse skeletal muscle ( Fig . 3b ) . We obtained efﬁcient staining with as little as 5 nM F - Lifeact , and signal intensity was not visibly reduced after exten - sive washing ( 10 times for 10 min after staining with 1 m M peptide ) . However , F - Lifeact rapidly exchanged on F - actin ( Fig . 3c ) ; the observed robust labeling was probably achieved because the peptide cannot exit from ﬁxed cells . Thus the F - Lifeact peptide can be used as a cheap and nontoxic alternative to phalloidin . We next used F - Lifeact to label live ﬁbroblasts and human neutrophils using ‘scrape - loading’ 14 . Fibroblasts loaded with F - Lifeact revealed the typical distribution of F - actin in stress ﬁbers and lamellipodia ( Fig . 3d ) . The ﬂuorescence signal was maintained over 4 – 6 h before degradation of the peptide and / or fading of the ﬂuorochrome . In scrape - loaded human neutrophils plated on immune complex – coated coverslips , we observed the formation of extensive undirected lamellar protrusions and of stable actin patches ( Fig . 3e and Supplementary Movie 6 online ) . These structures likely result from integrin - dependent cytoskeletal reorganization in response to immune complex deposits that have been previously studied only in ﬁxed cells , using ﬂuorescent phalloidin 15 . With only 17 amino acids , Lifeact can be synthesized quickly and cost - effectively , either as an oligonucleotide for the generation of fusion proteins or as a chemically labeled peptide . This makes Lifeact - derived probes widely accessible and opens up possibilities for the generation of actin - directed markers or drugs . Our results suggest that Lifeact can be used as a universal marker for actin imaging and as an alternative to phalloidin . However , although the low afﬁnity of Lifeact to F - actin reduces unwanted perturbations , it also limits its use for the measurement of intra - ﬁlament dynamics that are possible with speckle microscopy or photobleaching of labeled actin subunits . The most important advantage of Lifeact is its lack of interference with cellular processes . We could not measure signiﬁcant effects of Lifeact - GFP expression on sensitive processes such as neuronal polarization , lamellipodial ﬂow or leukocyte chemotaxis . This is consistent with Lifeact’s low binding afﬁnity to F - actin in vitro , its lack of effects on actin polymerization and depolymerization , and its lack of competition with major actin - binding proteins . In addition , Lifeact has no homologous sequences in higher eukaryotes , which makes competition with endogenous proteins less likely .
