D . Alsteens & co - workers at the Universit√© Catholique de Louvain , Louvain - La - Neuve , Belgium present chemical force microscopy ( CFM ) with hydrophobic tips to measure local hydrophobic forces on organic surfaces and on live bacteria . On organic surfaces , they found an excellent correlation between nanoscale CFM and macroscale wettability measurements , demonstrating the sensitivity of the method toward hydrophobicity and providing novel insight into the nature of hydrophobic forces . Authors also studied hydrophobic forces associated with mycolic acids on the surface of mycobacteria , and discuss the importance of these compounds .
