ON THE EVOLUTION OF RANDOM GRAPHS by P . ERD6S and A . R ~ NYI lotroduction Dedicated to Profe88m - P . Turdn at his 60th birthday . Our aim is to study the probable structure of a ra . ridom gra . ph r , . N which ha . s n given labelled vertices P 1 , P 2 , ••• , P , and N edges ; we suppose that these N edges are chosen a . t random among the ( ; ) possible edges , 80 tha . t & 11 ( r ; J ) = On , N poosible choices . . . . . , supposed to be equiprobable . Thus if G , . N den ~ tes a . ny one of the 0 " ~ graphs formed from - n given labelled points and having N edges , the probability that the random graph r , N is identical ' . with Gn . N is - 1 - . If . A is a . property which a . graph may or may not possess , o , , N We denote by p . . N ( . A ) the probability that the random graph F , N possesses . . , A . the property . 4 , i . e . we put P . . N ( A ) = n , N where AnN denotes the ~ 0 . n , N number of those Gn , N which have the property A . An other equiva . lent formulation is the following : Let us suppose that n labelled vertices P 1 , P , , . . . , P " are given . Let us choose a . t random an edge among the [ ; j possible edges , so that aJl these edges are equiprobable . Mter this let us choose an other edge among the remaining ( ~ j - 1 edges , and continue this process so that if aJ . rea . dy k edges are fixed , any of the remaining { ; } - kedges have equal probabilities to be chosen a . s the next one . We shall study the " evolution " of such a . random graph if N is increased . In this investi gation we endeavour to find what is the " typica . J . 7 ' $ tructure a . t a given stage of evolution ( i . e . if N is equal , o . r asymptotically equal , to a given function N ( n ) of n ) . By a " typical ~ ' structure we mea . n such a strueture the proba . bility of which tends to 1 if n - + + oo when N = N ( n ) . If A is such a property that lim p n , N ( n . ) ( A ) = 1 , we shall sa . y that , almost a . ll " graphs Gn , NV . ) n - + - + CD possess this property . 17 Publications of the Mathematical Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences , vol . 5 , 1960 18 The study of the evolution of graphB leads to rather surprising results . For a number of fundamental structuraJ properties A there exists a function A ( n ) tending monotonically to + co for n - + co sueh that ( I ) if Urn N ( n ) = 0 n ~ + • A ( n ) if lim N ( n ) " " " ' + co . n - + ~ A ( n ) If such a . function A ( n ) exists we shaU call it a . " tkre & hdd functwn " of the property A . In many cases besides ( 1 ) it is also true that there exists a proba . b ' ility distrib . utioh function F ( z ) so that if 0 < z < + = and z Is a . point of conti - · nuity of F ( z ) then ( 2 ) If ( 2 ) holds we shall say that A ( n ) is a . , . regular tkre11hold functimt " for the property A a . nd call the function F ( z ) the threshold distribution functibn of the property A . For certain properties A there exist two functions A 1 ( n ) and A 2 ( n ) · both tending monotonically to + co for n - + oo , and satisfying Jim A 2 ( n ) = 0 , n - + " A 1 ( R ) 1111ch that 0 if r N ( n ) - A 1 ( n ) 1m = - oo n - + • A 11 ( n ) ( 3 ) lim Pn .

It foJ1ows from ( 4 ) that if ( A 1 ( n ) , As ( n ) ) is a pair of sharp threshold functions for the property A then A 1 ( n ) ls an ( ordinary ) threshold furtction for the property A and the threahold distribution function figuring in ( 2 ) is the degenerated distribution function fO for z ~ l F " ( : t ) = \ 1 for z > 1 ON 1 ' K8 : & VOLv . ttO ~ 011 : LUIDOM Gl \ A . PBS 19 and con vergence in ( 2 ) takes place for every x 4 = 1 . In some ca . ses besides ( S ) it is also true that there exists a probability distribution function G ( ? / ) defined for - = < y < + oo such that if y is a point of continuity of G ( y ) then ( 5 ) If ( 5 ) holds we shallsa . y that we have a regular sharp threslwld and shall call G ( y ) the aharp - threalwld distribution fumtion of the property A . One of our chief aims will be to determine the threshold respectively sha . rp threshold functions , a . nd the corresponding distribution func : tions for the most obviOUS structural properties , e . g . the presence in r , . N ofsubgra . phs of a given type ( trees , cycles of given order , complete subgraphs etc . ) further for cert & in global properties of the graph ( connectedness , total number of connected components , etc . ) . In a previous paper [ 7 ] we have considered a . speoial problem of this type ; we have shown tha . t denoting by 0 the property that the graph is con - nected , the pair 0 1 ( n ) = _ ! _ n log n , 0 11 ( n ) = n is a . pair of strong threshold 2 functions for the property a . and the corresponding sharp - threshold distri bution function is e - r - 2ll ' ; thus we have proved 1 that putting 1 N ( n ) = - n log n + y n + o ( n ) we have 2 ( 6 ) lim P , . , , . , w ( O ) = e - • - 1 " " " " " " + CD ( - oo < y < + oo ) . In the present paper we consider the evolution of a . random graph in a . more systematic manner and try to describe the gra . dua . l development and step - by - step unravelling of the complex structure of the graph r , . , , . , when N increases while n is a . given large number . We succeeded in revealing the emergence of certain structural properties of r n N• However a . great deal remains to be done in this field . We shall call in § 10 . ' the attention of the reader to certain unsolved problems . It seems to us further that it would be worthwhile to consider besides graphs also more complex structures from the sa . me point of view , i . e . to investigate the laws governing their evolution in a . similar spirit . This may be interesting not only from a purely ma . thematica . l point of view . In fact , the evolution of graphs may be considered as a . rather simplified model of the evolution of certain communication nets ( railway , road or electric network systems , etc . ) of a . country or some other unit . ( Of course , if one a . ims at describing such a . real situation , one should replace the hypothesis of equiprobability of all connections by some more realistic hypothesis . ) It seems plausible that by considering the random growth of more complicated structures ( e . g . structures c : onsisting of different sorts of " points " and connections of different types ) one could obtain fairly reasonable models of more complex reaJ growth processes ( e . g . 1 Partial result on this problem has been obtained already in 1939 by P . ERDI5s and H . W & lTllliY but their results have not been published . 20 the growth of a . oomplex communication net consisting of different types of connections , a . nd even of organic structures of living matter , etc . ) . § § 1 - 3 . contain the discussion of the presence of certain components in a random graph , while § § 4 - 9 . investigate certain global properties of a . random gra . eh . Most of our investigations deal with the case when N ( n ) " ' e11 . with c > 0 . In fa . ct our results . give a . clear picture of the evolution of rn , NCn ) when c = N ( n ) ( which plays in a certain sense the role of time ) increases . 1 / , In § 10 . we ma . ke some further remarks and mention some unsolved problems . Our investigation belongs to the combinatorical theory of graphs , which has a . fairly large literature . The first who enumerated the number of possible graphs with a . given structure was A . CAYLEY [ 1 ] . Next the impor tant paper [ 2 ] of G . POLY A has to be mentioned , the starting point of which were some chemical problems . Among moro recent results we mention the papers of G . E . UHLENBE < JK and G . W . FoRD [ 5 ] and E . N . GILBERT [ 6 ] . A fairly complete bibliography will be ghron in a . paper of F . liABABY [ 8 ] . In these papers the probabilistic point of view was not explicitly emp : hasized . This has been done in the paper [ 9 ] of one of the authors , but the aim of the probabilistic treatment was there different : the existence of certa . in types of graphs has been shown by proving that their probability is positive . Random trees have been considered in [ 14 ] . In a recent paper [ 10 ] T . L . AusTIN , R . E . FAGEN , W . F . PENNEY and J . RIORDAN deal with random graphs from a point of view similar to ours . The difference between the definition of a . random graph in [ 10 ] and in the present paper consists in that in [ 10 ] it is admitted that two points should be connected by more than one edge ( " parallel " edges ) . Thus in [ 10 ] it is supposed that after a certain number of edges have already been selected , the next edge to be selected may be any of the possible [ : l edges between then given points ( including the edges already selected ) . Let us denote such a random graph by r ~ , N . The difference between the probable properties of rn , N resp . D ; , N a . re in most ( but not in a . ll ) cases negligible . The correspond ing probabilities a . re in general ( if the number N of edges is not too large ) asymptotically equal . There is a third possible point of view which is in most cases almost equivalent with these two ; we ma . y suppose that for each pair of n given points it is determined by a chance process whether the edge connecting the two points should be selected or not , the probability for select ing any given edge being equal to the same number p > 0 , and the decisions concerning the different edges being completely independent . In this case of course the number of edges is a . random variable , ha . \ ' ing the expectation ( ; ] p ; thus if we want to obtain by this method a random graph having in N the mean N edges we ha . ve to choose the value of p equal to ( ; 1 . We shall denote such a . random graph by r : ~ . In many ( though not all ) of the problems treated in the present paper it does not cause any essential difference if we consider instea . d of rn , N the random graph ~ · t ) ~ TEll - : J : : VOLt , " TTO ! i OF ll . . - \ NDOX GIU . PBS 21 Comparing the method of the present paper with that of ( 10 ] it should be pointed out that our aim is to obtain threshold functions resp . distributions , and thus we are interested in asymptotic formulae for the probabilities con sidered . Exact formulae are of interest to us onJysofar as they help in determi ning the asymptotic behaviour of the probabilities considered ( which is rarely the case in this field , as the exact formulae a . re in most cases too oompli ca . ted ) . On the other hand in ( 10 ] the emphasis is on exact formulae resp . on generating functions . The only exception is the average number of connected components , for the asymptotic evaluation of which a way is indicated in § 5 . of ( 10 ] ; this question is however more fully discussed in the present paper and our results go beyond that of [ 10 ) . Moreover , we consider not only the number but also tho character of the components . Thus for instance · we point out the remarkable change occuring at N r - J n . If N " " nc with c < 1 / 2 2 then with probability tending to 1 for n - + + oo all points except a bounded number Of points Of rP , N belong tO COmponents Which are trees , While for N r - J nc with c > . ! . this is no longer the case . Further for a fixed value of . 2 n the average number of components of rn . N decreases asymptotically in a linea . r manner with N , when N s ; . n , while for N > n the formula giving - 2 2 the average number of components is not linear in N . In wha . t foUows we shall make use of the sysmbols 0 and o . As usually a ( n ) = o ( b ( n ) ) ( where b ( n ) > 0 for n = 1 , 2 , . . . ) means that lim _ la ( n ) l = 0 , n - + . . . b ( n } while a ( n ) = 0 ( b ( n ) ) means that la ( n ) { is bounded . The parameters on b ( n ) which the bound of la ( n ) l may depend will be indicated if it is necessary ; b ( n ) sometimes we will indlca . te it by an index . Thus a ( n ) = 0 , ( b ( n ) ) mea . ns that 1 ; ~ ; 1 ~ K ( e ) where K ( e ) is a positive constant depending on e . We write a ( n ) ~ b ( n ) to denoto tha . t lim a ( n ) = 1 . n - + m b ( n ) We sha . ll use the following definitions from the theory of gra . phs . ( For the general theory see [ 3 ] and [ 4 ] . ) A finite non - empty set V of labelled points P 1 , P 1 , •• . , Pn and a . set E of different unordered pairs ( P ; , P 1 ) with . P 1 E V , P1 E V , i = F i i ~ called a graph ; we denote it sometimes by G = { Y , E } ; the num her n 1s called the order ( or Bize ) of the graph ; the points P 1 , P 1 , • • • , Pn are oaJled the vertices a . nd the p ~ irs ( Pi• P 1 ) the edges of the graph . Thus we consider non - oriented finite graph8 wiJ , hout parallel edges and without slings . The set E may be empty , thus a collection of points ( especially a single point ) is also a graph . A graph G 8 = { V 1 , E 1 } is called a . su ' 6graph of a graph G 1 = { V 1 , E 1 } if the set of : vertices V 1 of 0 2 is a . subset of the set of vortices V 1 of G 1 and tho ~ et E 2 of edges of G 2 is a ~ ubRot of the set E 1 of edges of G 1 . 22 A sequence of k edges of a graph such that every two consecutive edges and only these ha . ve a . vertex in common is called a path of order k . A oycUc sequence of k edges of a graph such that every two consecutive edges a . nd only these ha . ve a common vertex is called a cyck of order k . A graph G is called connected if any two of its points belong to a path which is a subgraph of G . A graph is called a tree of order ( or size ) k if it has k vertices , is connected and if none of its subgraphs is a . cycle . A tree of order k has evidently k - 1 edges . A graph is called a complete graph of order ( : ) if it has k vertices and ( ! } edges . Thus in a . complete graph of order k any two points are connected by an edge . A subgraph G ' of a graph G will be called an isolated BUbgraph if all edges of G one or both endpoints of whieh belong tu G ' , belong to G ' . A con nected isolated subgra . ph 0 ' of a graph G is ca . lled a component of G . The number of points belonging to a . component G ' of a graph G will be called the me of G ' . Two graphs shall be called iB011Wrphic , if there exists a one - to - one mapp ing of the vertices carrying over these graphs into another . The graph G shall be called complementary graph of G if G consists of the same verti ~ P 1 , P 1 , . •• , P , as G and of those and only those edges . ( P 1 , P1 ) which do not occur in G . The number of edges starting from the point P of a graph G will be called the degree of Pin G . A graph G is called a Baturated even graph of type ( a , b ) if it consists of a + b points and its points can be split in two subsets V 1 and V 8 consisting of a resp . b points , such that G contains any edge ( P , Q ) with P E V 1 and Q E V 1 and no other edge . A graph is called planar , if it can be drawn on the plane so that no two of its edges Intersect . We introduce further the following definitions : If a gra . ph G h & e n 2N vertices and N edges , we call the number - the " degree " of the graph . n 2N ( As a matter of fact - is the average degree of the vertices of G . ) If a graph n G has the property that G has no subgraph ha . v . ing a . qer degree than G itself , ' \ Ve ca1l G a balanced graph . We denote by P ( . . . ) the probability of the event in the brackets , by M ( ~ ) reap . 01 ( ~ ) the mean va . lue rasp . variance of the random variable E . In cases when it ia not clear from the context in which probability space tho probabilities or respeotively the mean values and variances a . re to be under stood , this will be expHcitly indicated . Especially Mn . N resp . D ~ . N will denote the mean value reap . variance calculated with respeet to the probabilities Pn , N• ON ' l ' li : S 8V ' OLIJTION 011 R ! NOOII [ Gll .

N shall have a point in common is by ( 7 ) clearly If however N r - .

If N is increased while n is fixed , the situation will change only if N reaches the order of magnitude of n 2 • ~ .

In general , the threshold function for the presence k - 2 of t ~ s of order k is W < - 1 ( k = 3 , 4 , . . . ) . This result is contained in the following Theorem 1 .

Such " compulsory " thresholds have been considered by ·p , TUBA . N [ 11 ] ( Bee a . lao [ 12 ] ) and later by P . EBn5s and A . H . STONE ( 17 ] ) . For instance for a tree of order 1c clearly the compulsory threshold is f ! _ ~ - ( k ; 2 ) ] + lj for the presence of at least one cycle the com - pulsory thres ~ old is n while according to a . theorem of P .

K5vABI , V . T . S6s and P . TuR ! N it has been shown that the compulsory threshold for the presence of a saturated even subgraph of type ( a , a ) is of order of magni - 2 - . ! . . tude not greater than n . • . In aU cases the " compulsory " thresholds in TUBAN ' a sense are of greater order of magnitude as our " proba . ble " thresholds . Q ' i TH1I : BVOWTION 01 ' l . UNDOJ ! l OB¥ ' B5 27 § 2 .

Thus the assertion of Theorem 10 follows . An interesting question is : what will be the chroma . tio number of F 11 N t ( The · chromatic number Oh ( I ' ) of a . gra . ph r is the least positive integer h such that the vertices of the gra . ph can h6 coloured by h colours so tha . t no two vertices whlch are connected by an edge should ha . ve the sa . me colour . ) Clearly every tree can be coloured by 2 colours , a , nd thus by Theorem 4a . almost surely ( Jh ( r 11 N ) = 2 if N = o ( n ) . As however the chromatic number of & graph ha viug an equal number of vertices and edges is equal to 2 or 3 a . ooording to whether the on1y cycle contained in sueh a . gra . ph - . is of e . ven or odd order , it fbllows from Theorem 5e that a . lmost surely Oh ( Fn .

It is an open problem hovdarge Oh ( Fn , N ( n ) ) is for N ( n ) ~ en withc > 1 / 1 • A further result on the chroma . tio number can be deduced from our a . bove remark on independent vertices . If a graph r has the chromatic number h , then its points ca . n be divided into h classes , so tha . t no two points of the same cJa . ss are connected by a . n edge ; as the la . rgest class has a . t least n points h . it follows that iff is the maximal number of independent vertices of r we ha . ve I " " ' : .

Hamilton - line ( i . e . a path which passes through all vertices ) resp . in ca . se n is even a factor of degree 1 ( i . e . a set of disjoint edges which contain all vertices ) . An other interesting question is : what is the threshold for the appear ance of a " topological complete graph of order k " i . e . of k points such that any two of them can be connected by a . path and these paths do not inter sect . For k > 4 we do not know the solution of this question . For k = 4 it follows from Theorem Sa that the threshold is n . It is interesting to 2 compare this with an ( unpublished ) result of G . DmAo according to which if N ~ 2n - 2 then G , , N contains certainly a topological complete graph of order 4 . We hope to return to the above mentioned unsolved questions in an other paper .
