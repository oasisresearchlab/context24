Borges † , Nicola G . Jones and Markus Engstler * Department of Cell and Developmental Biology , Biocenter , University of Würzburg , Würzburg , Germany Trypanosoma brucei is one of only a few unicellular pathogens that thrives extracellularly in the vertebrate host . Consequently , the cell surface plays a critical role in both immune recognition and immune evasion . The variant surface glycoprotein ( VSG ) coats the entire surface of the parasite and acts as a ﬂexible shield to protect invariant proteins against immune recognition . Antigenic variation of the VSG coat is the major virulence mechanism of trypanosomes . In addition , incessant motility of the parasite contributes to its immune evasion , as the resulting ﬂuid ﬂow on the cell surface drags immunocomplexes toward the ﬂagellar pocket , where they are internalized . The ﬂagellar pocket is the sole site of endo - and exocytosis in this organism . After internalization , VSG is rapidly recycled back to the surface , whereas host antibodies are thought to be transported to the lysosome for degradation . For this essential step to work , effective machineries for both sorting and recycling of VSGs must have evolved in trypanosomes . Our understanding of the mechanisms behind VSG recycling and VSG secretion , is by far not complete . This review provides an overview of the trypanosome secretory and endosomal pathways . Longstanding questions are pinpointed that , with the advent of novel technologies , might be answered in the near future . Keywords : cell surface , African trypanosomes , endocytosis , exocytosis , membrane recycling , Rab , clathrin INTRODUCTION African trypanosomes rely on eﬃcient strategies of immune evasion to successfully establish and maintain an infection in both their insect and mammalian hosts ( Pays et al . , 2014 ) . In the bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei , a dense coat of variant surface glycoprotein ( VSG ) constitutes the main virulence factor ( Vickerman , 1969 ; Cross , 1975 ) . The large repertoire of VSG genes coupled with periodic switches of the expressed VSG enables the parasites to change their surface epitopes , which allows an escape from the humoral immune response ( Cross et al . , 2014 ; Horn , 2014 ) . VSG mRNA abundance varies slightly depending on the nature of the expressed VSG , but can amount to as much as ∼ 15 % of total mRNA in T . brucei Lister 427 ( Maudlin et al . , 2021 ) and each trypanosome displays roughly 10 7 VSG monomers on its cell surface ( Jackson et al . , 1985 ; Bartossek et al . , 2017 ) . Thus , assuming a cell cycle of approximately 6 h , this would require the production of roughly 28 , 000 VSG molecules per minute . In steady - state cells , around 90 % of the entire VSG is displayed on the cell surface with the remaining 10 % found in intracellular compartments ( Grünfelder et al . , 2002 ) . Most of the intracellular VSG cargo is found Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 1 August 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 720521 fcell - 09 - 720521 August 3 , 2021 Time : 8 : 35 # 2 Link et al . Intracellular Trafﬁcking in T . brucei in endosomes , which harbor 3 - times as many VSG molecules than the biosynthetic organelles ( Grünfelder et al . , 2002 ) . A second trypanosome immune evasion strategy is based on the high mobility of the VSG coat , which aﬀords resistance to low levels of VSG binding antibodies . VSG molecules are covalently bound to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) anchor which mediates their attachment to the outer leaﬂet of the lipid bilayer and facilitates lateral diﬀusion ( Bülow et al . , 1988 ; Hartel et al . , 2016 ) . Since the single ﬂagellum is attached over the entire length of the trypanosome cell body and constantly beats , the directional motion generates a hydrodynamic ﬂow on the cell surface , which is directed toward the posterior of the cell . The ﬂuid ﬂow speciﬁcally drags antibody bound VSGs to the ﬂagellar pocket ( FP ) ( Figure 1 ; Engstler et al . , 2007 ) . The process of antibody clearance is very fast ( 30 – 60 s ) , with the predicted clearance time varying as a function of the size of the antibody ( Engstler et al . , 2007 ) . The parasite cell is shaped by a dense subpellicular microtubule cytoskeleton . This cortex is broken only at the FP rendering this invagination of the plasma membrane the exclusive place for endo - and exocytosis ( Overath et al . , 1997 ; Gull , 2003 ) . Both , maintenance of the VSG coat and the high rate of endocytic bulk membrane ﬂow demand eﬃcient intracellular transport machineries ( Engstler et al . , 2004 , 2007 ; Manna et al . , 2014 ) . The components of the trypanosome secretory and recycling machineries localize to the posterior part of the cell , ﬁlling the volume between nucleus and FP ( Grünfelder et al . , 2003 ; Engstler et al . , 2004 ; Field and Carrington , 2009 ; Manna et al . , 2014 ) . The exception to this is the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , which displays tube - like connections to the ﬂagellar attachment zone ( FAZ ) and , therefore , longitudinally spans the entire length of the cell body ( Vickerman , 1969 ; Lacomble et al . , 2012 ) . The fact that trypanosomes possess strictly localized exo - and endocytosis , combined with a high degree of cell polarization and full genetic tractability , makes them an attractive cellular model system . Furthermore , trypanosomes are placed in the group Discoba and hence , have diverged earlier than Opisthokonta , to which mammals and yeast belong ( Burki et al . , 2020 ) . This opens avenues for modern comparative cell biology . Here , we will review the mechanisms of VSG sorting and recycling . For this purpose , we summarize the main aspects of the corresponding pathways in yeast and mammals ﬁrst and subsequently highlight diﬀerences and gaps in our knowledge of the exo - and endocytosis machineries in T . brucei . In addition , we pinpoint how the advent of new and improved technologies might contribute to answering the remaining open questions . BIOSYNTHESIS AND SORTING OF SURFACE MOLECULES The biosynthesis of molecules inside a cell involves many complex and highly regulated steps , which are collectively known as the biosynthetic pathway . Despite molecule speciﬁc diﬀerences , newly synthesized proteins follow a general route to their target compartments . During passage through the biosynthetic pathway , nascent proteins are modiﬁed and folded into their three - dimensional conformations . Entry Into the Endoplasmic Reticulum Protein secretion starts with the targeted import of nascent polypeptides into the ER . In mammals and yeast , two main ways of protein import into the ER have been described : the co - translational and post - translational pathways ( reviewed in Aviram and Schuldiner , 2017 ) . In the co - translational pathway , the interaction between a signal peptide of the nascent protein with the signal recognition particle ( SRP ) targets the ribosome - nascent chain complex to the translocon ( Akopian et al . , 2013 ) . In contrast , the post - translational translocation of proteins from the cytoplasm to the ER is SRP - independent . In this pathway , cytosolic chaperons bind to the nascent , signal peptide containing proteins and direct them to the translocon ( Rapoport , 2007 ) . The translocon is a conserved heterotrimeric membrane protein complex which transports the nascent proteins into the ER ( Osborne et al . , 2005 ) . In T . brucei , both co - and post - translational pathways have been observed for the translocation of signal peptide containing proteins into the ER ( Boothroyd et al . , 1981 ; Lustig et al . , 2007 ; Goldshmidt et al . , 2008 ) , suggesting conservation of the ER - import mechanisms . However , the post - translational pathway may be favored for GPI - anchored proteins ( Goldshmidt et al . , 2008 ) while co - translational translocation may be more important for polytopic membrane proteins ( Boothroyd et al . , 1981 ; Lustig et al . , 2007 ) . Processing and Quality Control in the ER Once inside the ER lumen , the immature protein is exposed to ER - resident enzymes and undergoes several modiﬁcations assisted by chaperones and folding factors , which are usually referred to as the ER quality control system ( Ellgaard and Helenius , 2003 ) . A modiﬁcation that occurs in nearly all glycoproteins , and represents a major function of the ER , is N - glycosylation ( Helenius , 1994 ) . Polypeptides bearing the glycosylation consensus sequence ( N - X - S / T , where X can be any amino acid except for proline ) serve as acceptors for a preassembled oligosaccharide ( Welply et al . , 1983 ; Mohanty et al . , 2020 ) . The reaction is catalyzed by oligosaccharyltransferase ( OST ) which transfers Glc 3 Man 9 GlcNAc 2 en bloc to the asparagine side chain of the acceptor polypeptide ( Mohanty et al . , 2020 ) . Processing of the glycan begins immediately after this transfer reaction : glucosidase I hydrolyzes the outermost glucose , which is followed by the sequential removal of the remaining two glucose residues through glucosidase II ( Grinna and Robbins , 1979 ) . Monoglucosylated oligosaccharides are recognized by the ER lectin - like chaperones calnexin and / or calreticulin ( Williams , 2006 ; Rutkevich and Williams , 2011 ) , which prevent aggregation , oligomerization and formation of non - native disulﬁde bonds ( Moremen and Molinari , 2006 ) . Trimming of the innermost glucose residue by glucosidase II releases the protein from calnexin / calreticulin . UDP - glucose / glycoprotein glucosyl transferase ( UGGT ) senses the folding state of released glycoproteins and , if the correct conformation has not been achieved , UGGT reglucosylates the N - glycan to enable another cycle of calnexin / calreticulin assisted protein folding Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 2 August 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 720521 fcell - 09 - 720521 August 3 , 2021 Time : 8 : 35 # 3 Link et al . Intracellular Trafﬁcking in T . brucei FIGURE 1 | Schematic representation of exo - and endocytic pathways in Trypanosoma brucei . The known organelles involved in the processes of exo - and endocytosis in T . brucei are depicted : class I clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCV I ) , class II clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCV II ) , early endosomes ( EE ) , endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , exocytic carrier ( EXC ) , ﬂagellar pocket ( FP ) , Golgi apparatus ( G ) , lysosome ( L ) , late endosomes ( LE ) , nucleus ( N ) , and recycling endosomes ( RE ) . The endocytic compartment is marked by the presence of small GTPases of the Rab family : Rab5 ( EE ) , Rab7 ( LE ) , and Rab11 ( RE ) . The arrows represent the direction of exo - and endocytic cargo of T . brucei . The question marks indicate pathways that may exist but are still unknown . ( Solda et al . , 2007 ; D’Alessio et al . , 2010 ) . Finally , correctly folded proteins are released from the cycle ( Lederkremer , 2009 ) . The remarkable ability of UGGT to bind to misfolded or incompletely folded glycoproteins was already reported in the early 1990s ( Sousa et al . , 1992 ) , yet the complete recognition mechanism still remains unknown . Proteins that are unable to acquire their native structure must be degraded to prevent accumulation of misfolded polypeptides in the ER . This degradation process is known as ER - associated degradation ( ERAD ) , which usually involves recognition and retro - translocation from the ER to the cytosol , followed by ubiquitinoylation and proteasomal degradation ( Brodsky , 2012 ) . A special form of ERAD was reported for some misfolded GPI - anchored proteins in rat kidney cells ( Satpute - Krishnan et al . , 2014 ; Sikorska et al . , 2016 ) . Under acute ER stress , misfolded GPI - anchored proteins were exported from the ER , along the secretory pathway , to the plasma membrane from where they were eventually targeted to lysosomes for degradation ( Satpute - Krishnan et al . , 2014 ) . This pathway was termed rapid ER stress - induced export ( RESET ) but may also operate constitutively in unstressed cells ( Satpute - Krishnan et al . , 2014 ) . Trypanosomatid protozoa are unable to synthesize dolichyl phosphate glucose ( de la Canal and Parodi , 1987 ) . Thus , while eukaryotic cells usually transfer the oligosaccharide Glc 3 Man 9 GlcNAc 2 to their proteins , trypanosomatids attach unglucosylated glycans to the polypeptide chains ( Parodi , 1993 ) . In most eukaryotic organisms , the required OST consists of a multi - subunit protein complex with STT3A and STT3B as the catalytic domains . In contrast , T . brucei possesses three STT3 paralogs , with diﬀerent acceptor speciﬁcities , but no other subunits of the OST complex ( Izquierdo et al . , 2009b ) . Thus , trypanosomes extended their glycosylation ability by duplication of the STT3 gene and diversiﬁcation of STT3 speciﬁcity ( Izquierdo et al . , 2009b ; Schwarz and Aebi , 2011 ) . In addition , the recent ﬁnding of O - glycosylation of VSGs might indicate further unidentiﬁed biochemical diversity in protein processing factors in T . brucei ( Pinger et al . , 2018 ) . The orthologs of ER quality control proteins that were found and characterized in T . brucei include the reglucosylating UGGT , calreticulin , and glucosidase II ( Conte et al . , 2003 ; Jones et al . , 2005 ; Izquierdo et al . , 2009a ) . Although it is likely that the ER resident quality control machinery contributes to VSG folding , there is an ongoing discussion as to whether VSG folding is inherently energetically favorable and may therefore , not require chaperones ( Rehaber et al . , 1990 ) . While some evidence suggests that VSGs might be synthesized in 2 – 3 - fold excess , with their Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 3 August 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 720521 fcell - 09 - 720521 August 3 , 2021 Time : 8 : 35 # 4 Link et al . Intracellular Trafﬁcking in T . brucei relative abundance regulated by an active ERAD ( Field et al . , 2010 ; Manna et al . , 2014 ) , other studies found no evidence for rapid degradation and promote a model whereby VSG synthesis is precisely regulated ( Tiengwe et al . , 2016 ) . Interestingly , recent ﬁndings are adding a new piece to this puzzle . Aroko et al . ( 2021 , preprint ) demonstrated that targeting of several abundantly expressed proteins to the ER leads to a downregulation of mRNA levels of the endogenous VSG . Thus , they suggested that feedback generated at the ER has a central role in regulating VSG mRNA amounts . Export From the ER Proteins exit the ER at speciﬁc locations named ER exit sites ( ERES ) via vesicles coated with coat protein ( COP ) II . The highly conserved and essential COP II coatomer is generally composed of two protein complexes Sec23 / Sec24 and Sec13 / Sec31 , and the small GTPase Sar1 ( Lopez et al . , 2019 ) . Vesicle formation is initiated by Sec12 , a guanine exchange factor localized in the ER , which activates Sar1 ( Nakano and Muramatsu , 1989 ; Barlowe and Schekman , 1993 ; Futai et al . , 2004 ) . Activated Sar1 embeds into the ER membrane and recruits the ﬁrst heterodimer Sec23 / 24 via a speciﬁc interaction with Sec23 to the ERES ( Bi et al . , 2002 ; Fath et al . , 2007 ) . This “prebudding complex” selectively binds secretory cargo mainly via interaction with Sec24 and to a lesser extent with Sec23 ( Miller et al . , 2003 , 2005 ; Cai et al . , 2007 ; Farhan et al . , 2007 ) . Following this , the heterotetramer Sec13 / Sec31 is recruited , which stimulates membrane deformation and vesicle ﬁssion from the ERES ( Matsuoka et al . , 1998 ) . While transmembrane secretory cargo is selectively recruited via direct interactions between their cytosolic motifs and Sec24 ( Aridor et al . , 1998 ; Kuehn et al . , 1998 ; Miller et al . , 2003 ) , soluble and GPI - anchored proteins cannot interact directly with the COP II machinery ( Barlowe , 2003 ) . These proteins require transmembrane cargo receptors , such as p24 , which link them to the COP II coat ( Schimmoller et al . , 1995 ) . The subsequent transport of COP II vesicles from the ER to the Golgi is likely to be mediated by the small GTPases Rab1 and Rab2 ( Tisdale et al . , 1992 ) . In T . brucei , two isoforms each of Sec23 and Sec24 have been found , with TbSec23 . 2 and TbSec24 . 1 responsible for VSG export ( Sevova and Bangs , 2009 ) . While the abundance of synthesized and transported VSG may explain the requirement for an additional speciﬁc heterodimer , the mechanism by which VSGs are selectively incorporated into TbSec23 . 2 / TbSec24 . 1 COP II vesicles remains unknown . Recently , it was hypothesized that p24 orthologs in T . brucei may facilitate VSG incorporation into COP II vesicles ( Kruzel et al . , 2017 ) . Studies with TbRab1 and TbRab2 have validated the role of these GTPases in ER to Golgi and intra - Golgi transport ( Dhir et al . , 2004 ) . Golgi Trafﬁc The Golgi apparatus is a central membrane organelle that has a function in glycan maturation , traﬃcking and sorting . Each Golgi stack is formed by several tightly aligned ﬂattened cisternae , which are referred to as cis - , medial - or trans - compartments . While the cis - Golgi network receives cargo from the ER , the medial - Golgi cisternae contain glycosylation enzymes and process cargo proteins and lipids , and the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) sorts cargo molecules for delivery to diﬀerent destinations ( e . g . , to the cell surface or to vacuolar or lysosomal compartments ) ( reviewed in Di Martino et al . , 2019 ; Huang and Wang , 2017 ) . In addition , the TGN can also be separated from the Golgi stack and may act as an early endosome in yeast and plants , suggesting that this compartment might be an independent organelle that is distinct from the Golgi apparatus ( Uemura et al . , 2004 ; Dettmer et al . , 2006 ; Staehelin and Kang , 2008 ; Day et al . , 2018 ) . Surprisingly , the mechanism of transport through the Golgi , is still controversial and diﬀerent models that are not mutually exclusive have been suggested . The most prominent models suggest stable cisternae with COP I vesicles transporting cargo between them or cisternal maturation with progressive movement of cisternae toward the trans face ( reviewed in Glick and Luini , 2011 ) . COP I vesicles are also responsible for Golgi retrograde transport which returns ER resident proteins to the ER lumen ( Maier et al . , 2001 ) . However , the exact mechanism of delivery and the extent to which this occurs both remain unclear . In T . brucei , the stable cisternae model oﬀers the most likely explanation for intra - Golgi transport ( Warren , 2013 ) . TbRab18 ( Jeﬀries et al . , 2002 ) , and TbRabX2 ( also called TbRab31 ) ( Field et al . , 2000 ) have been associated with the Golgi apparatus and may be related to Golgi dependent transport pathways . In TrypTag . org , a project that aims to determine the localization of every trypanosome protein within the cell ( Dean et al . , 2017 ) , TbRab6 ( Tb927 . 2 . 2130 ) was also found to be located in the region of the Golgi . Post - Golgi Transport to the Plasma Membrane Cargo proteins destined for the plasma membrane are loaded into post - Golgi carriers and follow the secretory pathway ( Luini et al . , 2005 ) . In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , the molecules involved in this transport were identiﬁed by the isolation of sec mutants that were unable to secrete the extracellular enzyme invertase ( Novick et al . , 1980 , 1981 ) . Subsequent studies in yeast have strongly indicated an additional role of the Rab11 GTPase family in Golgi exit and transport to the sites of exocytosis ( Jedd et al . , 1997 ; Morozova et al . , 2006 ; Lipatova et al . , 2008 ) . Secretory carriers are directed by tropomyosin - actin cables and delivered to the plasma membrane to which they are tethered by the exocyst complex prior to SNARE complex dependent fusion in a Sec4 GTPase manner ( TerBush et al . , 1996 ; Guo et al . , 1999 ) . In T . brucei , the mechanism of transport from the Golgi to the FP remains elusive and it may be possible that diﬀerent carriers , perhaps containing diﬀerent cargos , are involved ( Figure 1 ) . The role and involvement of TbRab11 in the secretory pathway is still contentious . VSG has been demonstrated to be transported inside TbRab11 - enriched exocytic carriers during VSG recycling using immunoelectron microscopy ( Grünfelder et al . , 2003 ) . However , RNAi silencing of TbRab11 showed no eﬀect on exocytosis of newly synthesized VSG in pulse - chase radiolabel experiments ( Hall et al . , 2005 ) . In accordance with these results , another study , also using pulse - chase radiolabeling of VSGs , validated Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 4 August 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 720521 fcell - 09 - 720521 August 3 , 2021 Time : 8 : 35 # 5 Link et al . Intracellular Trafﬁcking in T . brucei that depletion of TbRab11 had no impact on the transport of newly synthesized VSG ( Umaer et al . , 2018 ) . However , no reports of TbRab11 negative secretory carriers can be found in the literature . This could be explained by the existence of a yet unidentiﬁed route from the Golgi to the FP that could easily have been overlooked due to the comparatively small proportion of biosynthetic VSG in the total intracellular VSG pool . Furthermore , the exocyst has been shown to be an important mediator of the late steps of exocytosis . This complex presents one subunit ( Sec15 ) which interacts with TbRab11 ( Boehm et al . , 2017 ) , highlighting once more the importance of this GTPase in the exocytosis process of T . brucei . Altogether , these ﬁndings suggest the need to characterize the role of TbRab11 in a more detailed manner . Is TbRab11 involved in post - Golgi transport to the FP ? Is this transport mediated via endosomes ? Does TbRab11 distinguish between VSG and other cargo transport ? Another intriguing aspect regarding Golgi transport to the FP is related to the role of the cytoskeleton . The export of newly biosynthesized VSG from the Golgi has been reported to be independent of actin ( Nolan and Garcia - Salcedo , 2008 ) . No further reports about the involvement of cytoskeleton components in cargo transport exist , but it is unlikely that these pathways can be entirely independent of interactions with the cytoskeleton . Thus , the role of the cytoskeleton remains largely undeﬁned . ENDOCYTOSIS AND MEMBRANE RECYCLING Endocytosis allows eukaryotic cells to internalize plasma membrane proteins and extracellular molecules for various physiological processes , including nutrient uptake , degradation , cell signaling and recycling . The endocytosis processes are generally divided into ﬂuid - phase and receptor - mediated endocytosis . The ﬁrst refers to the non - speciﬁc uptake of extracellular material , and the second is characterized by the triggered uptake of a ligand after binding to its receptor . Diﬀerent endocytic pathways exist in eukaryotes , such as caveolae - mediated ( Kiss and Botos , 2009 ) and raft - dependent endocytosis ( Lajoie and Nabi , 2007 ) . However , the major endocytic pathway is mediated by clathrin ( Bitsikas et al . , 2014 ) , which explains why the term endocytosis is often used synonymously with clathrin - mediated endocytosis . In T . brucei , all endocytic processes , for both ﬂuid phase and receptor - mediated uptake , are clathrin - mediated ( Allen et al . , 2003 ; Grünfelder et al . , 2003 ; Engstler et al . , 2004 ) . Clathrin - Mediated Endocytosis and Endocytic Trafﬁcking in Mammals and Yeast Clathrin molecules are trimers composed of three heavy chains , each associated with one light chain , connected through a central core ( Crowther and Pearse , 1981 ; Ungewickell and Branton , 1981 ) . Due to the architecture of the molecule , clathrin trimers are called triskelions ( Ungewickell and Branton , 1981 ) . Clathrin triskelions can connect with one another to form ﬂat lattices or a cage - like structure ( Crowther and Pearse , 1981 ; Kirchhausen and Harrison , 1981 ; Sochacki and Taraska , 2019 ) . The curvature of clathrin lattices linked to the membrane contributes to the forces required for local deformation , that culminates in pit formation and vesicle budding ( Kirchhausen and Harrison , 1981 ; Kaksonen and Roux , 2018 ; Sochacki and Taraska , 2019 ) . Flat hexagonal clathrin lattices need to reorganize to form the curved mix of pentagonal and hexagonal lattices ( Sochacki and Taraska , 2019 ) . The organization of clathrin triskelions into ﬂat lattices has also been shown to occur spontaneously in vitro ( Dannhauser et al . , 2015 ) . However , the conformational change from ﬂat to curved clathrin lattices in vivo most likely demands energy and requires the participation of accessory molecules ( reviewed in Kaksonen and Roux , 2018 ; Sochacki and Taraska , 2019 ) . The recruitment of clathrin to the plasma membrane requires several proteins that form the pioneer module , a complex with several characterized components , such as F - BAR domain only protein 1 and 2 complex ( FCHO1 / 2 ) , adaptor protein 2 ( AP - 2 ) , and epidermal growth factor receptor substrate 15 ( EPS15 ) ( Shih et al . , 1995 ; Ma et al . , 2016 ; Kaksonen and Roux , 2018 ) . In addition , several molecules such as actin - related protein 2 / 3 complex ( Arp2 / 3 ) , protein - rich protein Las17 ( Las17 ) , type I myosins ( Myo3 / 5 ) , Sla2 and epsin 1 ( Ent1 ) ( Galletta et al . , 2008 ; Cheng et al . , 2012 ; Feliciano and Di Pietro , 2012 ; Kaksonen and Roux , 2018 ; Lizarrondo et al . , 2021 ) , contribute to polymerization of the actin cytoskeleton . Finally , the progressive invagination of the membrane is associated with a constriction process , which culminates in membrane scission ( Kaksonen and Roux , 2018 ) . Constriction involves actin , dynamin , and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( reviewed in Mettlen et al . , 2009 ) . This phosphoinositide can bind to the epsin N - terminal homology ( ENTH ) and AP180 N - terminal homology ( ANTH ) domains of proteins and is considered critical for the recruitment of adaptors and formation of clathrin coated pits ( CCP ) ( Wendland et al . , 1999 ; Zoncu et al . , 2007 ; Kaksonen and Roux , 2018 ) , which bud as clathrin coated vesicles ( CCVs ) . These CCVs are then uncoated in a process involving dephosphorylation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 by inositol 5 - phosphatases and disruption of the clathrin – clathrin interactions by HSC70 ( Prasad et al . , 1993 ; Ungewickell et al . , 1995 ; Kaksonen and Roux , 2018 ) . The uncoated vesicles are able to fuse with endosomes , a polymorphic , dynamic endomembrane system , commonly divided into subpopulations named early ( or sorting ) endosomes ( EEs ) , late endosomes ( LEs ) , and recycling endosomes ( REs ) ( Goldenring , 2015 ; Naslavsky and Caplan , 2018 ) . These diﬀerent subclasses can be distinguished according to marker proteins enriched in their membranes , especially those belonging to the Rab family , as well as by diﬀerences in luminal pH ( Feng et al . , 1995 ; Rink et al . , 2005 ; Wandinger - Ness and Zerial , 2014 ; Raiborg et al . , 2015 ; Naslavsky and Caplan , 2018 ) which is controlled by a V - ATPase pump ( Hurtado - Lorenzo et al . , 2006 ; Scott et al . , 2014 ) . Endocytosed cargo enters EEs ﬁrst , from where the molecules are sorted for diﬀerent fates , either degradation or recycling . When destined for degradation , the cargo passes through LEs before arriving in the lysosome . In the recycling pathway , there are two possible routes : anterograde transport , which returns Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 5 August 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 720521 fcell - 09 - 720521 August 3 , 2021 Time : 8 : 35 # 6 Link et al . Intracellular Trafﬁcking in T . brucei the molecules to the cell surface , and retrograde transport , which transports cargo to the TGN ( Cullen and Steinberg , 2018 ; Naslavsky and Caplan , 2018 ) . The dynamics of cargo transport is still a topic of debate and distinct models have been proposed . The vesicular - transport model suggests that vesicles budding from steady - state organelles move their cargo to the diﬀerent endocytic compartments . However , studies on living mammalian cells have suggested the existence of a maturation process in which these organelles / compartments are formed from progressive diﬀerentiation of endocytic vesicles ( Rink et al . , 2005 ; Scott et al . , 2014 ; Langemeyer et al . , 2018 ; Trivedi et al . , 2020 ) . In mammals , the EEs have been characterized to be a vacuolar organelle associated with tubular membranous extensions ( Cullen and Steinberg , 2018 ) . They are further characterized by the presence of Rab4 , Rab5 , Rab10 , Rab14 , Rab21 , and Rab22 , which are found in distinct microdomains of the EE membrane ( Scott et al . , 2014 ; Naslavsky and Caplan , 2018 ) . Inside the EEs , molecules destined for degradation are sorted with the participation of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT ) into luminal invaginations of the EE membrane . These invaginations pinch oﬀ into the EE luminal space , thereby forming intralumenal vesicles ( ILVs ) . The ILVs accumulate in vacuolar regions of EEs , which will detach and become free multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) or endosomal carrier vesicles ( ECVs ) . The MVBs / ECVs are subsequently transported on microtubules to a diﬀerent location in the cell ( Scott et al . , 2014 ; Raiborg et al . , 2015 ) . Interestingly , live - cell microscopy studies suggested the maturation of these Rab5 - positive MVBs / EVCs into Rab7 - positive LEs , with Rab5 gradually replaced by Rab7 ( Rink et al . , 2005 ; Scott et al . , 2014 ; Langemeyer et al . , 2018 ) . Thus , the LEs are mature MVBs with a diﬀerent set of marker proteins and a more acidic pH . The morphology of LEs , with tubular - cisternae and multivesicular regions , is similar to that of EEs , which are also formed through ESCRT sorting into ILVs ( Scott et al . , 2014 ; Cullen and Steinberg , 2018 ) . From the LEs , the cargo can follow either the degradation or the recycling pathway . For degradation , LEs fuse with lysosomes , forming a hybrid organelle referred to as the endo - lysosome . This transient organelle matures into the classical lysosome , which can be distinguished from LEs through its spherical and electron - dense structure ( Rink et al . , 2005 ; Scott et al . , 2014 ) . Cargo from the LEs that is not destined for the lysosome , can be routed to the cell surface through tubular - vesicular carriers which fuse with the plasma membrane ( van Weering et al . , 2012 ; Cullen and Steinberg , 2018 ) . Another path back to the cell surface is via REs , which also have contact sites with EEs . This compartment is composed of highly dynamic tubular structures that are characterized by the presence of Rab11 and Rab8 ( reviewed in Hsu and Prekeris , 2010 ; Scott et al . , 2014 ; Goldenring , 2015 ) . Interestingly , in polarized cells , Rab11 seems to participate in direct recycling of cargo to the plasma membrane while Rab8 functions in transport via the TGN ( Hsu and Prekeris , 2010 ; Cullen and Steinberg , 2018 ) . Rab11 - positive vesicles that bud from REs are directed to the plasma membrane through interaction with actin - motor proteins ( Ji et al . , 2019 ) . Thus , actin is not only involved in CCV budding but also in the transport of endocytic cargo . The retrograde transport of molecules to the TGN is mediated by the retromer complex . This complex is formed by at least three cargo selection molecules ( Vps35 , Vps26 and Vps29 ) that interact with members of the sorting nexin ( SNX ) family ( reviewed in Scott et al . , 2014 ) . Endocytosis in T . brucei T . brucei restricts both endo - and exocytosis to the FP ( Figure 2 ; Vickerman , 1969 ; Overath et al . , 1997 ; Gull , 2003 ; Engstler et al . , 2004 ; Field and Carrington , 2009 ) . Uptake from the FP involves the formation of CCPs ( Morgan et al . , 2001 ; Allen et al . , 2003 ; Grünfelder et al . , 2003 ; Engstler et al . , 2004 ) , which rapidly pinch oﬀ as CCVs with a diameter of 135 nm , known as class I CCV ( CCV I ) ( Grünfelder et al . , 2003 ; Overath and Engstler , 2004 ) . Clathrin can be recruited to the entire FP membrane with the exception of the region of the microtubule quartet ( 4MT ) ( Gadelha et al . , 2009 ) . This recruitment involves many proteins , which will interact with each other as well as with clathrin , cargo , other adaptors , and phosphoinositides . TbEpsinR and TbCALM are two characterized proteins that possess a phosphoinositide binding domain ( ENTH and ANTH , respectively ) and are critical for the recruitment of adaptors as well as for formation of CCPs ( Gabernet - Castello et al . , 2009 ; Manna et al . , 2015 ) . While TbEpsinR has been shown to colocalize with clathrin ( Gabernet - Castello et al . , 2009 ) , the colocalization of clathrin and TbCALM has been inferred from their individual localization to the cytoplasmic side of the FP ( Manna et al . , 2015 ) . Interestingly , TbEpsinR was distributed throughout the cytoplasm in clathrin - depleted cells leading to the proposition of targeting - dependency between TbEpsinR and clathrin ( Gabernet - Castello et al . , 2009 ) . The depletion of either TbEpsinR or TbCALM led to a small reduction in receptor - mediated endocytosis and morphological aberrations in both CCP and CCVI ( Manna et al . , 2015 ) . The simultaneous knockdown of both proteins led to FP enlargement and inhibition of endocytosis , suggesting redundancy in the roles of the two proteins ( Manna et al . , 2015 ) . The ATPase TbHsc70 co - precipitates with clathrin and colocalizes with clathrin - enriched structures ( Adung’a et al . , 2013 ) . Knockdown of TbHsc70 reduces FITC - concanavalin A ( ConA ) traﬃcking into late endosomal compartments ( Adung’a et al . , 2013 ) , suggesting a probable involvement in uncoating as observed in vitro and in vivo for mammals and yeast ( DeLuca - Flaherty et al . , 1990 ; Rapoport et al . , 2008 ; Yim et al . , 2010 ) . Currently , no other proteins involved in clathrin uncoating have been detected in T . brucei . Intriguingly , AP - 2 , one of the major clathrin recruiters in opisthokonts , has not been identiﬁed in the genome of African trypanosomes although it is present in the genome of other trypanosomes , such as Trypanosoma cruzi , Trypanosoma theileri , Trypanosoma grayi , and Trypanosoma carassii ( Morgan et al . , 2002 ; Manna et al . , 2013 ) . The authors suggested that the high density of the VSG coat would not require cargo selection / accumulation to be coordinated by AP - 2 . They also proposed that the absence of this protein could increase the speed of endocytosis by reducing the need for dephosphorylation reactions in the clathrin uncoating processes ( Manna et al . , 2013 ) . However , clathrin uncoating is essential for cargo progression to the endosomal system . Therefore , dephosphorylation reactions Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 6 August 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 720521 fcell - 09 - 720521 August 3 , 2021 Time : 8 : 35 # 7 Link et al . Intracellular Trafﬁcking in T . brucei FIGURE 2 | Schematic structure of the ﬂagellar pocket with emphasis on its cytoskeleton components involved in endocytosis . The ﬂagellar pocket ( FP ) of Trypanosoma brucei is a subdomain of the plasma membrane , corresponding to approximately 2 – 5 % of its total area ( Grünfelder et al . , 2002 ; Engstler et al . , 2004 ; Field and Carrington , 2009 ) . On its most external face lies the ﬂagellar pocket collar ( FP collar ) of which TbBILBO1 is the main component ( Sherwin and Gull , 1989 ; Bonhivers et al . , 2008 ; Lacomble et al . , 2009 ) . On top of the FP collar lies the hook complex ( HC ) , a multiprotein structure , of which three components ( TbMORN1 , TbSmee1 , and TbPIPKA ) have been shown to be involved in endocytosis ( Morriswood et al . , 2009 ; Zhou et al . , 2010 ; Esson et al . , 2012 ; Demmel et al . , 2014 ; Morriswood and Schmidt , 2015 ; Perry et al . , 2018 ; Sajko et al . , 2020 ) . are necessary in the presence of any clathrin - coat accessory molecules that bind to phosphoinositide , such as PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 that is present in the FP membrane of T . brucei ( Demmel et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , the abolishment of AP - 2 dephosphorylation alone might not explain a faster endocytosis rate . A proteomic approach revealed the existence of T . brucei clathrin - associating proteins ( TbCAP ) that had not been identiﬁed through in silico screening ( Adung’a et al . , 2013 ) . Of these , eight were found to be exclusive to trypanosomatids : TbCAP116 , TbCAP118 , TbCAP125 , TbCAP161 , TbCAP186 , TbCAP292 , TbCAP334 , and TbTOR - like 1 ( Adung’a et al . , 2013 ) . Interestingly , knockdown of TbCAP100 , TbCAP116 , TbCAP161 and TbCAP334 decreased endocytosis of FITC - ConA at early time - points and led to FP enlargement , suggesting their involvement in clathrin assembly and VSG traﬃcking ( Adung’a et al . , 2013 ) . The cytoskeleton is another important factor in endocytosis . Recently , genetic screening conﬁrmed the presence of actin and actin - related proteins in T . brucei ( reviewed in Gupta et al . , 2020 ) . In bloodstream forms , actin is localized in the posterior region of the cell body , between the nucleus and kinetoplast , and its depletion causes impairment of endocytosis and enlargement of the FP ( Garcia - Salcedo et al . , 2004 ) . The actin cytoskeleton also seems to play a role in the polarization of the mechanoenzyme TbMyo1 in the posterior region of bloodstream form cells ( Spitznagel et al . , 2010 ) . Immunoﬂuorescence assays on ﬁxed cells revealed diﬀerences in both the number and the ﬂuorescence intensity of TbMyo1 spots inside the population suggesting a dynamic nature of the protein ( Spitznagel et al . , 2010 ) . Knockdown of TbMyo1 led to the impairment of endocytosis and changes in the subcellular distribution of clathrin , which clearly demonstrates its role in endocytosis ( Spitznagel et al . , 2010 ) . Previous studies had suggested that dynamin , involved in CCV budding in mammals and yeast , was not involved in endocytosis in T . brucei ( Morgan et al . , 2004 ) . However , the single dynamin - like protein of T . brucei has two paralogs ( TbDLP1 and TbDLP2 ) , which were found to have distinct expression patterns and functions depending on the life cycle stage of the parasite ( Benz et al . , 2017 ) . Compared to mammals and yeast , both the description and characterization of clathrin endocytosis in T . brucei lack details and require further analysis to be better understood . Among the questions to be elucidated are , for example , how clathrin recruitment and association with the CCP is coordinated and how cytoskeleton elements participate in vesicle budding from the FP membrane and in their subsequent transport . The use of proteomic methods to investigate the cohort of molecules involved in clathrin assembly in trypanosomes ( Adung’a et al . , 2013 ) highlighted the low conservation of the components compared to other eukaryote supergroups . This can either be explained by a reduced clathrin system in T . brucei , as suggested Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 7 August 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 720521 fcell - 09 - 720521 August 3 , 2021 Time : 8 : 35 # 8 Link et al . Intracellular Trafﬁcking in T . brucei previously , or it demonstrates the need for new experimental strategies to complement in silico homology searches . Endosomal Trafﬁcking in T . brucei In T . brucei , all endosomal compartments are in the posterior part of the cell ( Figure 1 ) . All endocytosed cargo , VSG and ﬂuid phase , pass through EEs ( Grünfelder et al . , 2003 ; Engstler et al . , 2004 ) . Following uptake , VSG starts to colocalize with EEs after 2 . 2 s and ﬁnally ﬁlls up to 85 % of the compartment volume ( Engstler et al . , 2004 ) . From this compartment , 53 % of the VSG pool moves to the REs and returns to the surface , a route known as the fast route , which is completed within approximately 10 s ( Engstler et al . , 2004 ) . Alternatively , 47 % of VSGs are recycled through the slow route , which takes approximately 50 s to complete ( Engstler et al . , 2004 ) . Here , VSG passes ﬁrst from the EE to the LE , a path also followed by the ﬂuid phase cargo , and then returns to the surface via the RE . Interestingly , while the ﬂuid phase cargo moves from the LE to the lysosome for degradation no VSG was detected inside this organelle ( Engstler et al . , 2004 ) . The retrograde transport of cargo to the TGN has not yet been characterized in T . brucei . Studies on the endosomal compartment of T . brucei have only been conducted on ﬁxed samples . This , allied to the transient nature of the maturation model , limits our comprehension of the endosomal compartment in this organism . Nevertheless , the endocytic compartment of T . brucei also has the characteristic tubular - vesicular shape found in other organisms ( Engstler et al . , 2004 ) . One molecule , TbMBAP1 , was found in all endosomal membranes ( Engstler et al . , 2005 ) . Four EE markers in this parasite have been identiﬁed through homology searches : one homolog of Rab4 ( TbRab4 ) , two homologs of Rab5 , TbRab5A , and TbRab5B ( Field and Boothroyd , 1995 ; Field et al . , 1998 ) , and one homolog of Rab21 , TbRab21 ( Ali et al . , 2014 ) . Studies using epiﬂuorescence microscopy have suggested TbRab4 and both subpopulations of TbRab5 to be present in vesicles in the cytoplasm of bloodstream forms ( Field et al . , 1998 ) . These vesicles were localized between nucleus and kinetoplast , which is where the endosomal compartment of T . brucei is found , and some overlap was observed ( Field et al . , 1998 ) . However , it is crucial to remember that the resolution of wideﬁeld microscopy combined with the close proximity of diﬀerent endocytic compartments does not allow an accurate localization . In addition , it is tempting to ask if these markers might all be part of a single structure with distinct subdomains . If that were the case , how is the cargo sorted inside this structure ? To answer these questions ( Figure 3 ) , it is crucial to use super - resolution microscopy . In bloodstream forms TbRab4 acts in ﬂuid phase transport to the lysosome and in the accumulation of the constitutive transmembrane glycoprotein p67 ( Hall B . S . et al . , 2004 ; Peck et al . , 2008 ) . TbRab5A was related to IgG , transferrin , VSG , and invariant surface glycoprotein ( ISG ) 65 transport , while TbRab5B has so far only been linked to ISG100 ( Field et al . , 1998 ; Chung et al . , 2004 ; Hall B . et al . , 2004 ) . The expression level of TbRab21 is low in the bloodstream forms of the parasite , but the overexpression of tagged TbRab21 revealed its localization in the posterior part of the cell ( Ali et al . , 2014 ) . Immunoﬂuorescence assays showed a partial overlap of TbRab21 with clathrin , TbRab5A and TbRab11 , and juxtaposition with p67 . However , some variation in the relative position of TbRab21 to TbRab11 and p67 - positive structures was observed within the population ( Ali et al . , 2014 ) . These variations in position could again be related to the limited resolution of the microscopy techniques used in the study along with cell - to - cell expression level variations . Furthermore , despite partial colocalization with TbRab5A , knockdown of TbRab21 did not have an impact upon the early steps of endocytosis , though it did have an eﬀect on the degradation pathway . These observations together with the colocalization of TbRab21 with TbRab28 and TbVps23 might suggest a role in late steps of endocytosis ( Ali et al . , 2014 ) . Orthologs of the ESCRT machinery , such as TbVps4 , TbVps23 , TbVps24 , and TbVps28 were found in T . brucei ( Leung et al . , 2008 ; Silverman et al . , 2013 ; Gilden et al . , 2017 ; Umaer and Bangs , 2020 ) . These ESCRT components as well as TbFab1 kinase and its product PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 , one of the ligands of TbVps24 , localize in LE membranes of T . brucei ( Leung et al . , 2008 ; Silverman et al . , 2013 ; Gilden et al . , 2017 ; Umaer and Bangs , 2020 ) . Despite the role of ESCRT in ILV formation and MVB development in mammalian cells , T . brucei lacks a well - deﬁned MVB ( Silverman et al . , 2013 ) . Another typical membrane - bound protein of LEs is TbRab7 ( Engstler et al . , 2004 ) . TbRab7 depletion does not aﬀect the endocytosis rate , but leads to complete cessation of delivery of the endocytosed cargo to the lysosome , a similar eﬀect to that observed upon silencing of TbVps23 and TbVps4 ( Silverman et al . , 2011 , 2013 ) . Interestingly , while TbRab7 has no inﬂuence on biosynthetic traﬃcking of the lysosomal markers p67 and TbCathepsin L ( TbCatL ) , the ESCRT components TbVps4 , TbVps23 and TbVps24 do ( Silverman et al . , 2011 , 2013 ; Umaer and Bangs , 2020 ) . Another Rab , TbRab28 , seems to be involved in transport to the lysosome . Depletion of the protein by RNAi resulted in reduced ConA transport to the lysosome in 80 % of the cells ( Lumb et al . , 2011 ) . LEs and lysosome localize proximal to the nucleus ( Engstler et al . , 2004 ) . The transport from EEs to LEs and / or lysosome is performed by class II clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCV II ) found budding from endosomes ( Grünfelder et al . , 2003 ) . CCVs II are 50 – 60 nm in diameter and are depleted in VSG and enriched in the ﬂuid - phase markers ferritin and horseradish peroxidase ( Grünfelder et al . , 2003 ; Engstler et al . , 2004 ) . Interestingly , a detailed study of the kinetics of endocytosis in T . brucei showed that the ﬂuid - phase marker dextran and biotinylated VSG ( VSG biotin ) were endocytosed at the same time and then were gradually segregated , reaching a maximum of spatial separation after approximately 1 min ( Engstler et al . , 2004 ) . At steady state 37 % of the intracellular VSG biotin did not lie on the endocytic route of internalized dextran ( Engstler et al . , 2004 ) . The authors suggested that the separation of VSG from the ﬂuid - phase marker occurred concurrently with the biphasic ﬁlling of the RE ( Engstler et al . , 2004 ) . The RE is a compartment where cargo transported from EEs and LEs can be redirected to the plasma membrane ( Grünfelder et al . , 2003 ; Engstler et al . , 2004 ; Overath and Engstler , 2004 ) . This endosomal compartment is predominantly marked by TbRab11 and has , to a certain extent , an interface with EEs ( Grünfelder et al . , 2003 ; Chung et al . , 2004 ; Engstler et al . , 2004 ; Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 8 August 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 720521 fcell - 09 - 720521 August 3 , 2021 Time : 8 : 35 # 9 Link et al . Intracellular Trafﬁcking in T . brucei FIGURE 3 | Open questions about endocytosis of trypanosomes . The general route of endocytosis and recycling in Trypanosoma brucei is depicted . The gray arrows represent the direction of all cargo while the red arrows refer solely to ﬂuid - phase cargo . Endo - and exocytosis is restricted to a single site in trypanosomes : the ﬂagellar pocket . Thus , the ﬁrst intriguing question is how does the cell discriminate between cargo entering and leaving the pocket ? All molecules are endocytosed via clathrin mediated endocytosis ( CME ) , the recycling rates are incredibly fast , and T . brucei lacks AP - 2 ( Grünfelder et al . , 2002 ; Morgan et al . , 2002 ; Engstler et al . , 2004 ) . Therefore , the naturally following questions are : how fast is CME and does the lack of AP - 2 inﬂuence this process ? VSGs have never been observed in the lysosome and the route to this organelle is likely to be mediated by class II clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCV II ) . So , the remaining questions here are how VSG is excluded from CCV II sorting and how these vesicles are routed to the lysosome . Furthermore , the number of endosomes in T . brucei cells and the origin of exocytic carriers remain elusive as does the mechanism of excretion of 95 % of the cargo . Overall , the essentiality of the VSG coat for trypanosomes allied to the natural increase of volume of the cell during the cell cycle advocates for a precise regulatory mechanism to maintain the dense surface coat . However , such a mechanism has not yet been elucidated . Field et al . , 2009 ) . From the REs , the recycling cargo is destined for the FP via TbRab11 - positive exocytic carriers . These disk - shaped carriers , with a diameter of ca . 154 nm and thickness of approximately 34 nm , were found close to both the FP and the cisternae - shaped endosomal compartment near the lysosome ( Grünfelder et al . , 2003 ; Engstler et al . , 2004 ) . Interestingly , electron microscopy revealed both VSG and horseradish peroxidase within the EXCs ( Grünfelder et al . , 2003 ; Engstler et al . , 2004 ) . Thus , TbRab11 has been proposed to be involved in both ﬂuid - phase and receptor - mediated cargo recycling to the cell surface . Consistent with these results , TbRab11 RNAi depleted cells showed an approximately 80 % reduction in recycling of transferrin ( Hall et al . , 2005 ) . However , conﬂicting observations were reported in a further study that used the same knockdown strategy . In this study , TbRab11 depleted and control cells were treated with cycloheximide to ﬂush nascent VSG from the exocytic pathway and free surface amino groups were blocked by acetylation at 4 ◦ C ( Umaer et al . , 2018 ) . Subsequently , shifting to 37 ◦ C allowed the recycling of internal unblocked VSG , which is susceptible to surface biotinylation . Flow cytometry revealed an increase of about 10 % in surface biotinylation 5 min after the temperature shift ( Umaer et al . , 2018 ) . The authors considered this to be similar to the kinetics of exocytosis in control cells . This led to the proposition of the existence of a redundant mechanism to recycle VSG to the cell surface ( Umaer et al . , 2018 ) . However , the endocytosis kinetics published by Engstler et al . ( 2004 ) reports that around 10 % of total VSG ( equivalent to the intracellular VSG pool ) is recycled per minute . Consequently , the measurement after 5 min can mask an up to ﬁve times slower recycling kinetics and the possibility of a functional , but less eﬃcient , recycling pathway without TbRab11 . Another possibility could be related to the activity of residual TbRab11 following RNAi , which might still be contributing to VSG transport . It would be desirable to look at earlier timepoints ( e . g . , 1 min ) to establish diﬀerences in kinetics of TbRab11 depleted and control cells . Therefore , the existence of a redundant mechanism in VSG recycling remains controversial . A third class of clathrin - coated vesicles was observed close to the outermost trans - Golgi cisterna , which was proposed to be the TGN equivalent in T . brucei ( Grünfelder et al . , 2003 ) . The TGN - homolog marker , TbGRIP70 , was localized in the outer Golgi cisterna of the trypanosomatid Leishmania mexicana that had been genetically modiﬁed to express TbGRIP70 , through immunoelectron microscopy ( McConville et al . , 2002 ) .

Intracellular Trafﬁcking in T . brucei The same localization was observed in T . brucei through immunoﬂuorescence assays using wideﬁeld microscopy ( Sealey - Cardona et al . , 2014 ) . However , whether this third class of clathrin vesicles in trypanosomes is part of the biosynthetic route , as observed in HeLa cells infected with varicella - zoster virus ( Alconada et al . , 1996 ) , or of the retrograde recycling route is not clear . Furthermore , homologs of the retromer complex subunits , associated with the retrograde transport in other organisms , were found in T . brucei ( TbVps26 , TbVps29 , and TbVps35 ) as was one homolog of the SNX family interactor ( TbVps5 ) ( Koumandou et al . , 2011 ) . Immunoﬂuorescence assays suggested a close association of the T . brucei retromer complex and the endocytic apparatus components ( Koumandou et al . , 2011 ) . However , a structural characterization is not available to date . The depletion of TbRab28 led to a decrease in the expression of TbVps26 and the ESCRT components TbVps23 and TbVps28 suggesting that these components may have a functional connection ( Lumb et al . , 2011 ) . Notably , the retrograde recycling mechanism is not associated with VSG ( Engstler et al . , 2004 ) . CONCLUSION In trypanosomes , most studies to identify adaptor / accessory proteins of the endocytic / exocytic machinery have employed homology searches based on genes found in mammals and yeast . Based on this , the trypanosome machinery has been deemed to be simpler than the machineries of the opisthokont models ( Manna et al . , 2014 ) . However , genomic BLAST is limited to similarity searches , indicating not the complexity of the characteristics of diﬀerent organisms but the conservation between them . Therefore , it is interesting and not entirely unexpected that studies using direct screening for trypanosome - speciﬁc proteins have led to the discovery of new components involved in distinct steps within the endocytic / exocytic machinery ( Adung’a et al . , 2013 ; Boehm et al . , 2017 ) . Investigations into the maturation model and evidence of endosomal mobility are still missing from T . brucei cell biology . For example , our knowledge of the contribution of the cytoskeleton to vesicle budding and transport is limited . Consequently , it would be interesting to analyze transport mechanisms for directed vesicle motion in T . brucei . In addition , speciﬁc VSG sorting at diﬀerent traﬃcking steps is likely to exist but remains to be studied . The methods used for subcellular localization and morphological descriptions of the endocytic / exocytic apparatus are another important aspect to be considered . The compartment markers have usually been located via wideﬁeld ﬂuorescence microscopy and characterized via RNAi knockdown . The use of electron microscopy has been restricted to the morphological analysis of the FP . However , considering the high dynamicity observed in endosomal tubules of living cells , analyses of ﬁxed samples could give the impression of a fragmented morphology ( Baetz and Goldenring , 2013 ; Goldenring , 2015 ) . Furthermore , microscope resolution is an important limiting factor that could also lead to inaccuracies in morphological descriptions , as overlapping signals in epiﬂuorescence microscopy can be resolved into subdomains inside an organelle when investigated by super - resolution microscopy ( Baetz and Goldenring , 2014 ) . Therefore , our understanding of the divergent endomembrane system of T . brucei still lags behind that of the classical opisthokont systems . A greater focus on trypanosomes could contribute to a broader comprehension of cell biology . In fact , a more wholesome understanding of the biodiversity requires an in depth look at a range of diverged organisms . Detailing the dynamics of endocytic processes with nanoscale resolution using novel and emerging technologies , such as live correlative light and electron microscopy ( live CLEM ) ( Fu et al . , 2019 ) or expansion microscopy ( Chen et al . , 2015 ) , will be the next step for all cell biology model systems , and this time there is no reason for the trypanosome model to lag behind .
