Structural studies indicate that caveolae are dec - orated on their cytoplasmic surface by a unique array of filaments or strands that form striated coatings . To understand how these nonclathrin - coated pits func - tion , we performed structural analysis of the striated coat and searched for the molecular component ( s ) of the coat material . The coat cannot be removed by washing with high salt ; however , exposure of mem - branes to cholesterol - binding drugs caused invagi - nated caveolae to flatten and the striated coat to disas - semble . Antibodies directed against a 22 kd substrate for v - src tyrosine kinase in virus - transformed chick embryo fibroblasts decorated the filaments , sug - gesting that this molecule Is a component of the coat . We have named the molecule caveolin . Caveolae rep - resent a third type of coated membrane specialization that is involved in molecular transport . Introduction Caveolae ( Yamada , 1955 ) or plasmalemmal vesicles ( Pa - lade , 1953 ; Palade , 1961 ; Palade and Bruns , 1968 ) are distinctive , nonclathrin - coated , membrane invaginations that are prominent on thesurfaceofendothelial cells ( Simi - onescu et al . , 1972 ; Simionescu et al . , 1975 ) , smooth mus - cle cells ( Forbes et al . , 1979 ; Somlyo et al . , 1971 ) and fibroblasts ( Bretscher and Whytock , 1977 ) but are most likely present in all cells . Although caveolae have been traditionally described as noncoated membrane invagi - nations , with appropriate preparation one can see on the cytoplasmic surface multiple electron - dense threads that wrap around the membrane of each caveola ( Montesano et al . , 1982 ; Somlyo et al . , 1971 ) . In en face views of the inner membrane surface , provided by either high resolu - tion scanning ( Peters et al . , 1985 ) or rapid - freeze , deep - etch replica methods ( Anderson , 1991 ; lzumi et al . , 1989 ; Steer and Heuser , 1991 ) , these threads appear as a stri - ated coat that decorates the cytoplasmic surface of each caveola . The en face views also show that the curvature of individ - ual caveola is quite variable ( Anderson , 1991 ) , which sug - gests that they are in different stages of invagination . These images give the impression that caveolae are dy - namic membrane structures that change shape in re - sponse to some type of physical force exerted on the mem - brane . The striated coat may be responsible for generating this force . There have been conflicting views about the function of caveolae . The invaginated morphology has been taken as evidence that they are capable of pinching off from the membrane to form the endocytic vesicles of an alternate uptake pathway for bulk phase and membrane - bound mol - ecules ( Anderson , 1991 ) . This view is supported by numer - ous studies ( Ghitescu et al . , 1986 ; Palade and Bruns , 1968 ; Simionescu et al . , 1982 ; Simionescu et al . , 1972 ; Simionescu et al . , 1975 ) on caveola - mediated , transendo - thelial movement of blood - borne macromolecules and by the finding that caveolae seem to internalize glycolipid - bound toxins ( Montesanoet al . , 1982 ; Tranetal . , 1987 ) . By contrast , extensive serial section and tracer penetration analysis of endothelial cells ( Bundgaard , 1983 ; Bundgaard et al . , 1979 ; Bundgaard et al . , 1983 ; Severs , 1988 ) has failed to find any evidence that caveolae form endocytic vesicles , which supports the view that caveolae represent a minor pathway for transendothelial movement of mole - cules ( Clough , 1991 ) . One reason for the discrepancy be - tween these studies is the lack of a membrane marker that allows one to distinguish caveolae - derived vesicles from other endocytic compartments . Recent studies on receptor - mediated folate uptake have implicated caveolae as an intermediate compartment in the internalization of this small molecule ( Kamen and Cap - devila , 1986 ; Kamen et al . , 1989 ; Kamen et al . , 1991 ; Ka - men et al . , 1988 ; Laceyet al . , 1989 ; Rothberg et al . , 1990a ; Rothberg et al . , 1990b ) . An essential vitamin , 5 - methylte - trahydrofolate , utilizes the folate receptor to gain entrance to certain cells . This glycosyl - phosphatidylinositol - anchored membrane protein ( Lacey et al . , 1989 ) is organized into clusters on the cell surface in association with caveolae ( Rothberg et al . , 199Oa ) . Internalization occurs in five steps : first , binding of 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate to its re - ceptor ; second , internalization of the ligandlreceptor com - plex ; third , dissociation of the 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate from its receptor in response to a low pH ; fourth , transport across the membrane via an anion carrier ; and fifth , reten - tion in the cell because of covalent addition of multiple glutamic acid residues . Each caveola is thought to create transiently acompartment of uniform and invariant diame - ter that maintains the dissociated molecule at aconcentra - tion favorable for movement through the anion carrier ( Ka - men et al . , 1991 ; Rothberg et al . , 1990a ) . Caveolae may function to transport a variety of small molecules and ions . To better understand this process , Cell 674 we have carried out an analysis of the striated coat and searched for the molecular components of the coat mate - rial . We found that a 22 kd protein , which was originally isolated because it is a major substrate for V - SK tyrosine kinase in virus - transformed chick embryo fibroblasts ( Glenney , 1989 ; Glenney and Zokas , 1989 ) is a compo - nent of the striated coat . We have named this molecule caveolin . Results Morphology of Caveolae Fibroblasts were chosen as the principal cell for analysis because they have abundant caveolae and are easy to manipulate experimentally . A typical thin section electron microscopic view of caveolae is shown in Figure 1 . Caveo - lae were not found uniformly distributed over the cell sur - face , but instead tended to collect near the migrating edge of thecell and juxtaposed tostressfibers . Theywere identi - fied on the basis of their distinctive , flask - shaped morphol - ogy and uniform curvature . Occasionally , multiple , faint striations ( arrows , Figure 1B ) were seen decorating the membrane . The overall organization of the caveola coat was best seen in rapid - freeze , deep - etch images of the inner mem - brane surface ( Figure 1 C ) . In noninvaginated segments of membrane , the flattened coats were composed of four to six concentrically arranged filaments or strands embed - ded in the membrane to form an alternating ridge and furrow pattern ( Figure 1C ) . The morphology of this pattern was quite variable . Sometimes the ridges were arced , cir - cular , or even spiral ( Figure lC , solid arrow ) ; other times they were arranged in parallel arrays ( Figure lC , curved arrow ) . The coats on invaginated membranes ( Figure lC , open arrows ) retained the same general morphological features of the planar coats . Figure 1 .

The supernatant fraction ( S ) and the pellet fraction ( P ) were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , transferred to nitrocellulose , and incubated with eitheranti - caveolin IgG ( anti - 22 kd IgG ) or irrelevant IgG ( 2001 IgG ) before processing as described in Experimental Proce - dures . Clathrin , as well as clathrin - associated proteins , can easily be stripped from membranes by a brief salt wash ( Mahaffey et al . , 1990 ) . Figure 2A shows that when mem - branes were washed with high salt , the morphology of the striated coats was unchanged even though the clathrin lattices were completely removed . Caveolae disappear in cells that are depleted of choles - terol ( Rothberg et al . , 1990b ) , which suggests that this sterol is required to maintain the integrity of the striated coat . For this reason , we analyzed the effects of two sterol - binding drugs , filipin and nystatin , on the structure of the coat ( Rothberg et al . , 1990b ) . Attached membranes were exposed either to control buffer ( Figure 28 ) nystatin ( Figure 2C ) , or filipin ( Figure 2D ) and then examined by rapid - freeze , deep - etch microscopy . As little as 5 min of exposure caused all of the rounded caveolae to completely flatten ( compare Figure 28 with Figure 2C ) . After 15 min the striated coat began to unravel ( Figure 2D ) . As the coat disintegrated , the segmented appearance of the fila - ments , which was vaguely visible in control images ( see Figure lB ) , became more apparent ( Figure 2C ; inset , arrow ) . These images suggest that the filaments are as - sembled from subunits . Clathrin - coated pits , actin cables , and other structures on the membrane were not affected by these treatments ( data not shown ) .

Cell 678 Identification of a Protein Component in the Coat Glenney and co - workers ( Glenney , 1989 ; Glenney and Zo - kas , 1989 ) used an anti - phosphotyrosine monoclonal anti - body to isolate a 22 kd protein from chicken fibroblasts that becomes phosphorylated in response to Rous sar - coma virus ( RSV ) infection . When we used a monoclonal antibody against this protein ( designated anti - caveolin IgG ) to immunoblot fractionated human fibroblasts , a 22 kd band was present in the 10 , 000 x g membrane pellet but absent from the supernatant fraction ( Figure 3 ) . Immu - nofluorescence localization of antibody - binding sites in these cells ( Figure 4A , 6 ) showed that staining was con - fined to discrete domains on the plasma membrane either at the leading edge of the cell ( arrows , Figure 4A ) or in linear arrays on the cell surface ( Figure 4B ) . Within each domain , the staining had a fine , punctate pattern . There was also a variable amount of staining in the Golgi region of the cell ( data not shown ) . Staining was not seen when anti - caveolin IgG was replaced with 2001 IgG , an irrele - vant monoclonal antibody ( Figure 4C ) . This immunofluorescence staining pattern appeared to correspond to the distribution of caveolae in these cells ( Severs , 1988 ) . This was verified by immunogold labeling with anti - caveolin IgG ( Figure 5A ) . Cross sections of the fibroblast cell surface showed that gold labeling was asso - ciated with caveolae . Often the gold outlined the caveolae membrane ( Figure 5A , curved arrows ) , whereas flanking segments of membrane were devoid of label ( Figure 5A , arrowheads ) . Quantitative analysis of the gold distribution showed that whereas caveolae membrane had 50 gold particles per 10 urn of cell surface , noncaveolar membrane had only 7 gold particles per 10 urn . Gold label was not present in caveolae of fibroblasts that had been incubated with 2001 IgG ( Figure 58 ) nor was there any labeling with anti - caveolin IgG if the cells were not first permeabilized ( data not shown ) . Favorable tangential sections through the membrane showed linear arrays of caveolae in align - ment with actin stress fibers ( Figure 5C , between arrows ) . Many of these caveolae were also decorated with gold . Caveolae are also found in most epithelial cells ( Ya - mada , 1955 ) . When we applied immunogold labeling methods to determine the distribution of caveolin in mon - key kidney epithelial cells ( Figure 5D ) , many of the caveo - lae were labeled ( Figure 5D , curved arrows ) . In contrast with fibroblasts , the intensity of labeling was much less . Membranes from these cells were also positive by immu - noblot ( data not shown ) . Thus far , there has not been a definitive way to deter - mine whether or not caveolae pinch off from the membrane to form endocytic vesicles . Anti - caveolin IgG might func - tion as a marker for such a compartment . Fibroblasts were incubated in the presence of horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) to label endocytic compartments and then pro - cessed to localize anti - caveolin IgG binding sites by im - munogold labeling ( Figure 5E ) . We failed to find gold associated with HRP - containing vesicles ( Figure 5E , ar - rowheads ) , even though antibody labeling of caveolae was normal ( Figure 5E , curved arrows ) . Confirmation of the thin section labeling was obtained by applying the immunogold technique to isolated mem - branes and then processing them for rapid - freeze , deep - etch analysis . Figure 6A shows that caveolae were labeled with gold particles after the membranes were incubated with anti - caveolin IgG plus anti - mouse IgG - gold ( Figure 6A , arrows ) . By contrast , gold was not present on mem - branes that had been incubated in the presence of 2001 IgG ( Figure 6B ) . The intensity of labeling was too low to determine positively whether the antibody was directly la - beling the coat . This problem was overcome by incubating the membranes in the presence of nystatin to unravel the coat before applying the immunogold reagents . After this treatment , the intensity of labeling was substantially in - creased ( Figures 6C and 6D ) , and there was a clear associ - ation of gold label with partially fragmented filaments ( Fig - ure 6D , arrows ) . These results suggest that the 22 kd protein is a component of the coat . Discussion Caveolae join clathrin - coated pits ( Anderson , 1991 ) and nonclathrin - coated buds of the Golgi apparatus ( Orci et al . , 1989 ) as specially coated membrane invaginations . The latter two are each cloaked with a molecular complex containing multiple proteins that have similar molecular weights ( Serafini et al . , 1991 ; Waters et al . , 1991 ) . The morphology of each coat is quite distinctive ( Orci et al . , 1989 ) which suggests that the individual coats have a special function to serve within cells . The coating material of these membrane specializations is generally thought to provide two important functions ( Anderson , 1991 ) : to control the shape of the membrane and to attract receptors that use the pit as a portal of entry into specific vesicular pathways . The presence of both flat and highly invaginated caveolae in rapid - freeze , deep - etch images ( see Figure 1C ) suggests that the coat con - trols membrane curvature . Likewise , there is good evi - dence that certain membrane molecules are preferentially attracted to caveolae ( Rothberg et al . , 1990a ) . Caveolae Coats Several lines of evidence implicate the 22 kd protein as a component of the filaments that make up the striated coat . When the coat material disassembled in the presence of sterol - binding agents , the subunit structure of the fila - ments was revealed . At the same time , more antibody binding sites became exposed ( compare Figure 6C with Figure 6D ) . Most likely this is because the antigenic site is partially masked in the assembled filament . Both immu - nogold labeling ( Figure 6 ) and direct antibody decoration experiments ( data not shown ) also show that the 22 kd protein binds to the filaments . We propose that this protein be named caveolin to reflect that it is a component of the caveolae coat . Caveolin was first isolated from RSV transformed chick embryo fibroblasts as a tyrosine phosphorylated protein ( Glenney and Zokas , 1989 ) . By contrast , caveolin is not phosphorylated in chick fibroblasts infected with RSV that express a mutant pp60v - src lacking the consensus se - quence for covalent addition of myristate ( Glenney , 1989 ) . This mutation renders the kinase unable to localize to the Caveolae Coat 679 Figure 6 . Rapid - Freeze , Deep - Etch lmmunogold Localization of Caveolin in Either Untreated or Nystatin - Treated Membranes Membranes were prepared as described in Experimental Procedures . Untreated membranes ( A and 6 ) were incubated with 35 nglml indicated antibody ( anti - caveolin IgG [ A ] or 2001 IgG [ B ] ) at 4°C for 1 hr . Treated membranes ( C and D ) were incubated with 50 rig / ml nystatin for 5 min at 4°C before incubating with anti - caveolin IgG . All of the membranes were then incubated in the presence of gold - conjugated anti - mouse IgG for 1 hr at 4’ % before being processed for rapid - freeze , deep - etch electron microscopy . ( A ) : arrows , labeled caveolae . ( C and D ) : arrows , fragmented filaments from the coat that are labeled with gold . Bar , 0 . 25 pm . cell surface , and as a consequence the virus does not transform the cells . Thus , caveolin meets the requirement of being a protein that is specifically phosphorylated in the transformed cell ( Kamps et al . , 1986 ) . Two other proteins located in membrane specializations are thought to be tyrosine phosphorylated in response to RSV infection : the heavy chain of clathrin ( Martin - Perez et al . . 1989 ) and connexin43 ( Swenson et al . , 1990 ) . Clathrin is phosphorylated on both tyrosine and serine residues , and the stoichiometry of phosphorylation on tyrosine is only 6 % . This amount of modification may be enough to alter the distribution and function of coated pits in these cells . Phosphorylation of connexin43 , by contrast , has been correlated with inhibition of junctional communica - tion in RSV - transformed cells ( Crow et al . , 1990 ) . Swenson et al . ( 1990 ) showed that expression of connexin43 in Cell 680 paired Xenopus oocytes induces communication between thetwo cells . Coexpression of pp80v - ” abolishes the ability of cormexin43 to induce communication , and this effect is reversed by removal of the tyrosine residue from con - nexin43 . Caveolin responds to salt washing as if it were an inte - gral membrane protein . On the other hand , it is also resis - tant to extraction from intact cells by Triton X - 100 ( Glenney and Zokas , 1989 ) . One explanation for these results is that caveolin is anchored to the cytoskeleton . Therefore , we looked carefully for sites of interaction between the striated coat and either actin filaments or microtubules but did not find any evidence of contact sites . Either these interac - tions are disrupted during the preparation of cells and membranes for microscopy , or the resistance of caveolin to T & n X - 100 extraction . reflects some other physical property of the caveolae membrane . lrleceptoc Interaction with Cavewlae Recent studies on receptor - mediated folate transporl ( KL + men et al . , 1991 ; Rothberg et al . , 1990a ) have shown that individual clustersof the fdate receptor coHect over caveo - lae . Obviously the lipid anchor would not permit a direct interaction between the receptor and caveolin , which is on the other side of the membrane . Either lip & anchored membrane proteins prefer caveolae because they bind to a resident transmembrane protein that is , in turn , an - choredtoeaveolin , or the physical properties of the lipids in this membrane domain cause the localization of GPI - an & ored molecules . The ability of sterol - binding drugs to diiperse both the striated coat and clustered folate recep - tors ( Rothbergetaf . , 199Ob ) arguesinfavorofalipid - based clustering mechanism . Still unanswered is the issue of whether or not caveolae actually pinch off from the membrane to form endocytic vesicles ( Ckxgh , 1991 ) . We have tried to resolve this ques - tion by following caveolae markers during internalization . When we used the folate receptor as the marker , we could not detect an internal compartment that contained any receptor ( Rothberg et al . , 199Oa ) . Moreover , folate recep - tors are unable to internalize this antibody ( Rothberg et al . , 199Oa ) . The anti - caveolin IgG also failed to detect any endocytic vesicles that contained both HRP and caveolin ( see Figure 5E ) . Although these results suggest that vesi - cles generated from caveolae only rarely merge with endo - somes , more work will be required to map the exact path - way of internalization by caveolae . Caveolae are abundant in many cell types ; therefore , they must be a functionally important organelle . Our previ - ous studies suggest that one of their roles may be to serve as a vehicle for the entrance of sparse molecules with low molecular weight ( Kamen et al . , 1991 ; Rothberg et al . , 1990a ) . The discovery of caveolin will enhance our ability to understand the function of caveolae and the relationship between this organelle and cell transformation . Experimental Procedures Materials Chemicals used for immunofluorescence , electron microscopy , and cell culture were obtained as previously described ( Rothberg et al . , 1990a ; Rothberg et al . , 199Ob ) . Antibodies were obtained from the following sources : goat anti - mouse IgG and goat anti - mouse IgG conju - gated to fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) from Zymed Laboratories , Inc . ( South San Francisco , CA ) ; monoclonal mouse anti - dinitrophenol ( DNP ) IgG from Oxford Biomedical ( Oxford , Ml ) ; goat anti - mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase from BioRad ( Richmond , CA ) ; and goat anti - mouse IgG conjugated to gold ( IO nm ) from Energy Beam Sciences ( Agawam , MA ) . HRP was obtained from Polysciences , Inc . ( Warrington , PA ) . Cell Culture Cultured fibroblasts were derived from a skin biopsy obtained from a normal subject . Cells were grown in monolayer and set up for experi - ments according to a standard format ( Goldstein et al . , 1983 ) . On day 0 , 2 . 5 x lo4 cells were seeded into each petri dish ( 60 x 1 . 5 mm ) containing 3 ml Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 100 U / ml penicillin , 100 pglml streptomycin , and 10 % ( vol / vol ) fetal calf serum . Fresh medium of the same composition was added on day 3 . On day 5 of cell growth , each monolayer received 3 ml Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with penicillin , streptomycin , 5 & ml selenium , 5 pglml insulin , 5pglml transferrin ( ITS Premix ) , and 10 % ( vollvol ) human liproprotein - deficient serum . Cells were used on day 7 of cell growth . MA104 cells were grown as previously described ( Rothberg et al . , 1990a ) . lmmunocytochemistry Indirect lmmunofhorescence Microscopy Cells were washed quickly with Buffer A ( 100 mM sodium phosphate [ pH 7 . 41 containing 3 mM KCI and 3 mM MgCI , ) and then fixed with 3 % ( w / v ) paraformaldehyde plus 3 mM trinitrophenol in buffer A for 45 min at room temperature . Cells were rinsed with Buffer A for 10 min and then incubated for 20 min with 100 mM NH & I in 100 mM sodium phosphate ( pH 7 . 4 ) . Cells were permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 5 min at 4OC . Cells were then incubated sequentially with Buffer B ( Buffer A plus 0 . 15 % bovine serum albumin ) for 30 min at 4OC , 10 pg / ml either monoclonal anti - caveolin IgG or monoclonal 2001 IgG ( an irrelevant IgG [ Rothberg et al . , 1990a ] ) for 1 hr at 4°C and 25 pglml goat anti - mouse IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate for 1 hr at 4OC , all in buffer B . After each incubation , cells were rinsed three times with Buffer B , IO min each at 4OC . Finally , cells were rinsed with Buffer A and distilled water before mounting in a 2 . 5 % solution of 1 , 4 - diazabicyclo - ( 2 . 2 . 2 ) octane ( Valnes and Brandtzaeg , 1985 ) . Cells were observed and photographed using a Zeiss Photomicroscope Ill with appropriate filter package . lmmunoelectron Microscopy Cells were fixed as described above for indirect immunofluorescence and incubated with Buffer C ( Buffer B plus 0 . 01 % saponin ) for 30 min at room temperature . Cells were then labeled by the DNPlimmunogold method of Pathak and Anderson ( 1989 ) . In brief , cells were incubated with 25 & ml either monoclonal anti - caveolin IgG or monoclonal2001 IgG in Buffer C , rinsed with Buffer C , and then incubated with 15 pg / ml goat anti - mouse IgG conjugated to DNP . All antibody incubations were for 1 hr at 4OC . Cells were fixed with 1 . 33 % glutaraldehyde in Buffer A , incubated with 100 mM NH & I in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer ( pH 8 . 0 ) , and post - fixed with 1 % OsOs containing 1 . 5 % po - tassium ferricyanide . Samples were then dehydrated , embedded in Eponate , sectioned , and processed to localize DNP groups by immu - nogold labeling as previously described ( Pathak and Anderson , 1989 ) . In some cases cells were incubated with 1 mglml HRP for 5 - 30 min before processing for immunoelectron microscopy . Prior to treatment with OsOa , the cells were processed to visualize the HRP by standard methods ( Pathak et al . , 1988 ) . Quantification of the gold distribution was performed on electron micrographs printed at a constant magnification . For caveolae , the average membrane circumference was calculated from the average diameter of the invagination . The number of gold particles associated with 1068 caveolae was tabulated and converted to gold particles per 10 pm of membrane from the circumference measurements . For non - caveolar membrane , 80 pm of membrane was measured , and the number of gold particles in this amount of membrane was used to calculate the density . Caveolae Coat 681 Rapid - Freeze , Deep - Etch Electron Microscopy Cell membranes on coverslips were prepared by overlaying a poly - l - lysine - coated ( 1 mg / ml ) coverslip onto the upper surface of cultured human fibroblasts , applying gentle pressure , and removing the cov - erslip with adherent membranes , all at 4°C ( Larkin et al . , 1986 ; Nicol and Nermut , 1987 ; Sanan and Anderson , 1991 ) . Membranes were either immediately fixed for 30 min at 4OC with 4 % glutaraldehyde in Buffer D ( 20 mM Hepes , 100 mM KCI , 5 mM MgCI , , 3 mM EGTA [ pH 6 . 81 ) or incubated in the presence of 5 pglml filipin at 4’C or 50 fig / ml nystatin at 28OC in Buffer D for the indicated time prior to fixation . Nystatin ( 50 mglml ) and filipin ( 5 mg / ml ) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted in Buffer D to a final concentration of 50 vglml and 5 pg / ml , respectively , prior to use . Control cells were incubated in the presence of 0 . 001 % dimethyl sulfoxide for the indicated time and temperature . Each coverslip was cut into 3 - 4 mm squares and rapidly frozen by the method of Heuser and Evans ( 1980 ) . Samples were etched and coated with platinum and carbon using a freeze fracture unit ( model 301 ; Balzers Inc . , Hudson , NH ) with a rotating stage set at 136 rpm . Samples were coated with - 9 A of platinum using an electron gun a ! an angle of 24 degrees . The replica was then reinforced with - 120 A of carbon using an electron gun at an angle of either 90 degrees or 50 degrees . Replicas were floated free of the coverslips in 30 % hydroflu - oric acid and digested with Clorox for 1 min before being mounted on formvar - coated grids . For immunogold localization of caveolin , membranes were chilled for 20 min prior to incubation with 35 Kg / ml anti - caveolin IgG in Buffer D for 1 hr at 4°C . This was followed by three quick rinses with Buffer D and incubation with goat anti - mouse IgG coupled to 10 nm gold . After quickly rinsing with Buffer D , membranes were fixed and processed as previously described , except that replicas were not digested with Clorox before being mounted on formvar - coated grids . lmmunoblot Analysis Cells plated on 100 mm petri dishes were harvested with 0 . 03 % EDTA m phosphate - buffered saline ( pH 7 . 0 ) . After centrifugation at 900 x g for 5 min . cells were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen . Frozen cells were resuspended in 10 mM Tris - HCI ( pH 8 . 0 ) containing 40 PM leupeptin , 1 PM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , and sonicated with a 118 inch step - probe 2 times at 40 J / watt - second . The homogenate was centri - fuged at 10 , 000 x g for 60 min . The pellet was resuspended in 10 mM Tris - HCI ( pH 8 . 0 ) . The supernatant was concentrated with an Amicon centrlcon - 10 . Aliquots of both the 10 , 000 x g supernatant and pellet were dissolved in sample buffer ( Laemmli , 1970 ) and 30 pg of protein was loaded on each lane of a 12 % polyacrylamide gel before electro - phoresis . After electrophoresis , protein bands were transferred over - night at 4’C to nitrocellulose filters ( Towbin et al . , 1979 ) , incubated with buffer E ( 3 % fish gelatin , 50 mM Tris , 300 mM NaCl [ pH 7 . 61 ) followed by incubation with 25 Kg / ml anti - caveolin IgG in buffer E . The filters were then incubated for 2 hr at 25°C with a 111000 dilution of stock goat anti - mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and processed to visualize the bands using the BClPlNBT phosphatase substrate system ( Kirkegaard and Perry , inc . , Gaithersburg , MD ) . Pro - tein determinations were done by the method of Bradford ( 1976 ) , using bovine serum albumin as a standard .
