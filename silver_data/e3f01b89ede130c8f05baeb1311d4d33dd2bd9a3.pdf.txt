The online version of this article contains supplemental material . Introduction Animals use a succession of tissue transformations between ep - ithelium and mesenchyme to achieve tissue remodeling during embryogenesis . Upon transdifferentiation of epithelial cells to mesenchymal cells ( epithelial – mesenchymal transition [ EMT ] ) , cells detach from neighboring cells and acquire migratory po - tential . Mesoderm and endoderm cells are formed during gas - trulation with EMT of embryonic ectoderm or epiblast cells . A number of genes are known to be either down - or up - regulated at the transcriptional level ( Yamaguchi et al . , 1994 ; Sun et al . , 1999 ; Batlle et al . , 2000 ; Cano et al . , 2000 ; Carver et al . , 2001 ; Lee et al . , 2006 ) . At the same time , it is believed that post - transcriptional events must also play crucial roles in the EMT ( Xue et al . , 2001 ; Zohn et al . , 2006 ) , although the details of such events are still largely unknown . The principal mediator of cell – cell adhesion in the epithe - lial cell sheet is the cadherin - mediated adherens junction spe - cialized at subapical surfaces ( D ’ Souza - Schorey , 2005 ) . Focal adhesions are the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) – integrin junctions that bring together cytoskeletal and signaling proteins during the process of cell spreading and migration ( Mitra et al . , 2005 ) . Upon EMT the disassembly of the adherens junctions correlates with a loss of cell – cell contact and an acquisition of migratory potential by the activation of focal adhesions ; the two processes must be tightly coordinated . Dynamics of the adherens junc - tions and focal adhesions are controlled by the assembly and disassembly of adhesion components coupled with cytoskeletal remodeling . It has been suggested that p120 catenin ( p120ctn ) regulates the stability of E - cadherin in adherens junctions ( Ireton et al . , 2002 ; Davis et al . , 2003 ; Peifer and Yap , 2003 ; Xiao et al . , 2007 ) . Paxillin is a key factor regulating focal adhesion dynam - ics ( Kondo et al . , 2000 ; Hagel et al . , 2002 ) . Band 4 . 1 superfamily members have a FERM domain at their N terminus and an actin - binding domain at their C terminus , and are thought to play crucial roles in the regulation of interac - tions between integral plasma membrane proteins and cytoskele - ton just beneath the plasma membrane ( Sun et al . , 2002 ) . By the E PB41L5 belongs to the band 4 . 1 superfamily . We investigate here the involvement of EPB41L5 in epithelial – mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) during mouse gastrulation . EPB41L5 expression is induced during TGF (cid:2) - stimulated EMT , whereas silencing of EPB41L5 by siRNA inhibits this transition . In EPB41L5 mutants , cell – cell adhe - sion is enhanced , and EMT is greatly impaired during gastrulation . Moreover , cell attachment , spreading , and mobility are greatly reduced by EPB41L5 deﬁ ciency . Gene transcription regulation during EMT occurs normally at the mRNA level ; EPB41L5 siRNA does not affect either the decrease in E - cadherin or the increase in integrin expres sion . However , at the protein level , the decrease in E - cadherin and increase in integrin are inhibited in both EPB41L5 siRNA - treated NMuMG cells and mutant mesoderm . We ﬁ nd that EPB41L5 binds p120ctn through its N - terminal FERM domain , inhibiting p120ctn – E - cadherin binding . EPB41L5 overexpression causes E - cadherin relocalization into Rab5 - positive vesicles in epithelial cells . At the same time , EPB41L5 binds to paxillin through its C terminus , en - hancing integrin / paxillin association , thereby stimulating focal adhesion formation .

JCB • VOLUME 182 • NUMBER 6 • 2008 1218 Results EPB41L5 in EMT of NMuMG cells Erythrocyte band 4 . 1 superfamily proteins have been suggested to play roles in epithelial integrity , and we had chosen epithe - lial NMuMG cells to examine EPB41L5 functions . However , EPB41L5 was barely detectable in confl uent epithelial NMuMG cells ( Fig . 1 , Ab , c , and Bb ) . Epithelial NMuMG cells are trans - formed into mesenchyme - like cells ( “ mesenchyme ” ) by treat - ment with TGF (cid:2) ( Miettinen et al . , 1994 ) . With this transition , the EPB41L5 expression was markedly elevated ( Fig . 1 , Ab , c , and Bd ) . In addition , EPB41L5 siRNA inhibited the EMT of NMuMG cells by TGF (cid:2) . At the mRNA level , even when the EPB41L5 protein expression was inhibited by the siRNA ( Fig . 1 Ad ) , E - cadherin expression was reduced and (cid:2) 1 - integrin , Snail , and Twist expression were all enhanced normally by TGF (cid:2) ( Fig . 2 , Aa and Ba ) . At the protein level , however , E - cadherin expression was retained and (cid:2) 1 - integrin expression was not elevated signifi cantly ( Fig . 2 , Ab and Bb ) . EPB41L5 siRNA did not affect the increase in N - cadherin expression by TGF (cid:2) ; nor did it affect (cid:3) - catenin , (cid:2) - catenin , p120ctn , or paxillin expression ( Fig . 2 A ) . Concomitantly , EPB41L5 siRNA - treated NMuMG cells did not undergo morpho - logical transformation into “ mesenchyme ” by TGF (cid:2) , retaining E - cadherin at the sites of cell – cell contact ( Fig . 1 , Be and f ) . Mesodermal defects in EPB41L5 mutants To confi rm EPB41L5 functions in the EMT in vivo , we next generated a mouse mutant ( Fig . S1 A , available at presence and absence of characteristic domains at the C - terminal side they are classifi ed into several families : Band 4 . 1 , PTPH , ERM , talin , and novel band 4 . 1 like ( NB41L ) families . The NB41L family has unique nonhomologous C termini and lacks an actin - binding domain ; the family can be further divided into EPB41L4a and EPB41L5 families by the sequence identity of the FERM domain . In the mouse , the EPB41L5 family includes another member , EPB41L4b / Ehm2 , in addition to the EPB41L5 ex - amined in this study ; all vertebrates have two members in the EPB41L5 family , whereas Drosophila has only one . Drosophila Yurt and zebrafi sh Moe in this family have recently been demon - strated to function as negative regulators of Crumbs ( Crb ) ortho - logues , which control epithelial polarity and apical membrane size in embryonic epithelia and photoreceptor cells ( Jensen and Westerfi eld , 2004 ; Hsu et al . , 2006 ; Laprise et al . , 2006 ) . In this study we demonstrate that mouse EPB41L5 plays essential roles in EMT and cell migration during mouse gas - trulation . We propose that EPB41L5 coordinates the down - regulation of E - cadherin – mediated cell – cell adhesion and activation of integrin - mediated cell – ECM adhesion in a post - transcriptional manner during EMT . EPB41L5 may destabilize E - cadherin by binding to p120ctn , predisposing it toward endocytosis . EPB41L5 also binds to paxillin and enhances paxillin / integrin association , thereby activating focal adhesions . The study reveals a new aspect of the function of scaffold band 4 . 1 superfamily member proteins , which is obviously different from its function as a component of the Crumbs complex , but consistent with the EPB41L5 activation in oncogenic cells .

( B ) Inhibition of TGF (cid:2) - induced EMT of NMuMG cells by EPB41L5 siRNA . EPB41L5 ( red ) is scarce in the conﬂ uent epithelial NMuMG cells in the absence of TGF (cid:2) ; E - cadherin ( green ) is abundant at cell – cell contact sites ( a and b ) . In “ mesenchymal ” cells induced by TGF (cid:2) , EPB41L5 is abundantly present with no E - cadherin expression ( c and d ) . EPB41L5 siRNA inhibits the transformation into “ mesenchyme ” by TGF (cid:2) ( e ) , retaining E - cadherin at cell – cell contact sites ( f ) .

These mutant phenotypes are essentially the same as those of an ENU - induced mutant , limulus ( lulu ) , recently re - ported ( Lee et al . , 2007 ) ; it has a point mutation at the 5 (cid:4) termi - nus of EPB41L5 coding region , generating a stop codon or a null mutation . EPB41L5 mutant defects in EMT during gastrulation Under electron microscopy , defects were also not apparent at E6 . 5 , with the exception of several invaginating mesoderm cells in tight contact ( Fig . 3 , Ca – b ’ ) . Laterally , several invaginated cells were also attached tightly to each other ( Fig . 3 Cc ’ ) . Cell archi - tecture was mostly normal in epiblast and endoderm . At E7 . 5 defects were apparent over three germ layers . Ectoderm cells lost their columnar epithelial shape and were multilayered ; they were associated closely with minimal intercellular spaces ( Fig . 3 , Cd and d ’ ; see also Fig . 4 c ’ ) . Tight junction , adherens junction , and desmosome were normally formed in the most apical layer of the cells ( Fig . 3 , Ce and e ’ ) , but not in other cells . ZO - 1 and occludin , components of the tight junction , were also found as normal in the most apical layer of EPB41L5 mutant ectoderm ( not depicted ) . Basement membrane was barely de - tectable in the basal side of ectoderm cells in any layers ( Fig . 3 , Cf and f ’ ) . Collagen type IV and laminin , components of the basement membrane , were partially present beneath the multi - layered ectoderm cells ( Fig . 4 ) . Increase of cell number in ectoderm with multi - cell strati - fi cation would be explained by increase in cell proliferation or decrease in cell apoptosis . However , the ratio of BrdU incorpo - rating cells was 24 . 8 % in wild - type and 25 . 2 % in mutant ectoderm http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200712086 / DC1 ) . The mutant is null as demonstrated by RT - PCR analysis with prim - ers at the site of mutation and at the 3 (cid:4) exons and by Western blot analysis ( Fig . S1 , Bc and d ) . During gastrulation EPB41L5 protein was apparent at the cell periphery in invaginating cells ( Fig . S2 Bc , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200712086 / DC1 ) . In ectoderm , EPB41L5 was enriched at both the apical and basal sides , but less abundant on lateral sides ( Fig . S2 Bd ) ; details of EPB41L5 expression in early embryogenesis are given in Fig . S2 . At E6 . 5 mutant embryos were proximo - distally reduced in size but histologically almost normal ( Fig . S2 , Ca and a ’ ; Fig . 3 , Aa and b ) . At E7 . 5 the embryos were hypomorphic ( Fig . S2 , Cb and b ’ ) ; spaces were scarce among three germ layers , and em - bryonic cells in each layer appeared to be stacked together ( Fig . 3 , Ab and b ’ ) . Snail - positive mesoderm cells were differentiating , but they spread poorly over the embryos ( Fig . 3 , Ba and a ’ ) . Brachyury - positive axial mesoderm developed in the primitive streak , but did not extend anteriorly beyond the node ( Fig . 3 , Bb and b ’ ) . At E8 . 5 the rostro - caudal extension was retarded in the mutants ( Fig . S2 , Cc and c ’ ) , and development of headfold was meager with minimum mesoderm cells ( Fig . 3 , Ac and c ’ ) . The foregut failed to close and neuroectoderm was hypertrophic ( Fig . S2 , Da , a ’ , c , and c ’ ) ; E8 . 5 wild - type anterior neuroecto - derm was still a single cell layer of the epithelial plate ( Fig . S2 Dd ) , whereas in EPB41L5 mutants the neural plate was multi - cell layered ( Fig . S2 Dd ’ ) . Presomitic mesoderm was generated but segmented somites were never formed in the mutants ( Fig . 3 , Ac and c ’ ; Fig . S2 , Db and b ’ ) . Marker analyses confi rmed these mesodermal defects ( Fig . S3 A , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200712086 / DC1 ) , but the mutant developed Figure 2 .

Moreover , the total cell number was around 15 , 000 per embryo in both wild - type and mutant E7 . 5 embryos . At E7 . 5 a signifi cant number of mesoderm cells are present in the anterior part of wild - type embryos . However , they were few in EPB41L5 mutant embryos . Laterally intercellular space was scarce among invaginated mesoderm cells , and the cells ad - hered tightly to each other ( Fig . 3 , Cg and g ’ ) . Most prominently , at the primitive streak invaginating cells were in tight contact with little intercellular space ( Fig . 3 , Ch – i ’ ) . Endoderm cells also adhered tightly , and basement membrane was not found electron microscopically ( Fig . 3 , Cj and j ’ ) ; collagen type IV or laminin was also not apparent in the endoderm layer ( Fig . 4 ) . Intercellu - lar space was scarce not only between adjacent cells in each germ layer but also among cells in the three germ layers . In wild - type embryos , ectoderm and endoderm cells ex - press E - cadherin ( Fig . 4 , b and c ) ; this expression decreases in invaginating mesodermal cells ( Fig . 4 b ) and is lost in invagi - nated cells ( Fig . 4 c ) , acquiring N - cadherin ( Fig . 4 d ) and (cid:3) 5 - integrin ( Fig . 4 e ) expression . In EPB41L5 mutants , E - cadherin not only continued to be expressed in invaginating mesoderm cells but also persisted in invaginated mesoderm cells ( Fig . 4 , b ’ and c ’ ) . N - cadherin expression took place apparently normally while (cid:3) 5 - integrin expression did not in the mutant invaginated mesodermal cells ( Fig . 4 , d ’ and e ’ ) . Thus , the decrease in E - cadherin expression and the increase in integrin expression dur - ing cell invagination are inhibited , but the increase in N - cadherin expression is not , by the EPB41L5 defi ciency . These are consis - tent with the observations in NMuMG cells ( Fig . 2 ) . EPB41L5 in cell – cell and cell – substrate adhesions The increase in cell – cell adhesion by EPB41L5 defi ciency was also demonstrated in vitro by the aggregation assay with mutant embryonic cells ( unpublished data ) . It was also demonstrated with TGF (cid:2) - treated NMuMG cells by the EPB41L5 siRNA treatment ( Fig . 5 A ) . Thus , the defects in the mesoderm transi - tion and mesoderm movement by EPB41L5 defi ciency could be ascribed to the retention of E - cadherin – mediated cell – cell inter - action ( Fig . 4 , b ’ and c ’ ) , as is the case in p38 - defi cent embryos ( Zohn et al . , 2006 ) . The effect of cell surface E - cadherin down - regulation on cell movement of EPB41L5 mutant primitive streak cells was then examined with anti – E - cadherin antibody . However , the antibody treatment was not suffi cient to restore cell movement of EPB41L5 mutant primitive streak cells ( Fig . 5 B ) , suggesting that cell – ECM interaction is also affected in the mutant . Indeed , E7 . 5 EPB41L5 mutant embryonic cells were found to attach poorly to a fi bronectin - coated dish ; about half of the cells did not attach even after overnight culture ( Fig . 5 Ca ) , and their spreading was also poor ( unpublished data ) . The de - crease in cell attachment to fi bronectin - coated dish was also demonstrated with NIH3T3 and TGF (cid:2) - treated NMuMG cells by EPB41L5 siRNA treatment ( Fig . 5 Cb ; Fig . S4 Aa , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200712086 / DC1 ) ; cell spreading was also reduced by this treatment ( Fig . 5 , Cc and d ; Fig . S4 , b and c ) . Next , the decrease in mobility of EPB41L5 mutant em - bryonic cells was demonstrated by time - lapse cinematography ( unpublished data ) . It was also observed with NIH3T3 and TGF (cid:2) - treated NMuMG cells after siRNA treatment ( Fig . 5 D ; Fig . S4 B ) . Furthermore , wound healing was also impaired by EPB41L5 siRNA . When monolayer NIH3T3 or TGF (cid:2) - treated NMuMG cells are scratched and cultured , the scratch is nor - mally restored by cell migration ( Fig . 5 Ea ; Fig . S4 Ca ) . This recovery was greatly impaired when the cells were treated with EPB41L5 siRNA ( Fig . 5 Eb , Fig . S4 Cb ) . Thus , not only cell – cell adhesions are enhanced , but also cell adhesions to substrate are impaired by EPB41L5 defi ciency . Figure 4 .

JCB • VOLUME 182 • NUMBER 6 • 2008 1222 repeats of p120ctn and FERM domain of EPB41L5 . p120ctn binds to E - cadherin also through armadillo repeats . The effects of EPB41L5 on E - cadherin – p120ctn interaction were there - fore examined . p120ctn binding to E - cadherin was indeed inhibited by EPB41L5 , but not by EPB41L5 lacking the N terminus ( Fig . 6 e ) . EPB41L5 lacking C - terminal but having N - terminal FERM domain ( EPB41L5 (cid:6) C ) also inhibited p120ctn binding to E - cadherin ( Fig . 6 f ) . p120ctn also binds to N - cadherin , but this binding was not affected by EPB41L5 ( Fig . 6 g ) . Wild - type EPB41L5 and EPB41L5 lacking C - terminal with intact N - terminal FERM domain localized at the cell membrane , but EPB41L5 lacking the N - terminal did not ( Fig . 7 , b , f , and j ; Fig . 9 B ; Fig . S5 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200712086 / DC1 ) . Effects of EPB41L5 overexpression on E - cadherin local - ization were examined using TGF (cid:2) - untreated epithelial NMuMG EPB41L5 interaction with E - cadherin – associated adhesion components E - cadherin degradation is known to be mediated by Arf6 , Hakai , and p120ctn ( D ’ Souza - Schorey , 2005 ; Xiao et al . , 2007 ) . EPB41L5 bound to p120ctn , but not to Arf6 or Hakai ( Fig . 6 a ) . Moreover , in TGF (cid:2) - treated NMuMG cells endogenous EPB41L5 was found to associate with p120ctn ( Fig . 6 b ) . EPB41L5 did not bind to either (cid:3) - or (cid:2) - catenin . p120ctn that lacked an N terminus could associate with EPB41L5 , but that which lacked a C terminus could not ( Fig . 6 c ) . The C - terminal region of p120ctn consists of armadillo repeats and a tail domain ; deletion of the tail domain did not affect the binding to EPB41L5 ( unpublished data ) . On the other hand , although EPB41L5 lacking the C terminus ( EPB41L5 (cid:6) C ) could associate with p120ctn , that lacking the N terminus ( EPB41L5 (cid:6) N ) could not ( Fig . 6 d ) . Thus , these two proteins probably interact through armadillo Figure 5 . Roles of EPB41L5 in cell – cell and cell – substrate interaction . ( A ) Cell aggregation assay .

This suggests the possibility that p120ctn is recruited into paxillin complex by EPB41L5 . Indeed , in TGF (cid:2) - treated NMuMG cells p120ctn associated with paxillin , and this asso - ciation was abolished by EPB41L5 siRNA ( Fig . 8 e ) . Further - more , p120 ctn / paxillin association was enhanced by EPB41L5 overexpression in NIH3T3 and Cos7 cells ( Fig . 8 f ) . In NIH3T3 - and TGF (cid:2) - treated NMuMG cells , EPB41L5 overlapped with paxillin - and (cid:3) 5 - integrin – positive focal adhe - sions ( Fig . 9 A ; Fig . S5 B , a – d ) . When EPB41L5 was expressed in epithelial T47D cells , the cells developed remarkable membrane ruffl es and protrusions , and the number of paxillin - positive fo - cal adhesions increased dramatically ( Fig . 9 , Ba and b ) . EPB41L5 that had N - terminal p120ctn binding domain and lacked the C - terminal paxillin binding domain ( EPB41L5 (cid:6) C ) localized at the plasma membrane , but could not induce membrane ruffl es nor enhance focal adhesions ( Fig . 9 Bc ) . On the other hand , EPB41L5 that lacked the N - terminal but had the C - terminal do - main ( EPB41L5 (cid:6) N ) did not localize at the plasma membrane but was able to induce membrane ruffl es and enhance focal ad - hesions ( Fig . 9 Bd ) . As described above , EPB41L5 siRNA decreased cell at - tachment to substrate , cell mobility , and cell spreading in NIH3T3 cells ( Fig . 5 ) . Normally NIH3T3 cells have paxillin - and (cid:3) 5 - integrin – positive focal adhesions where actin fi bers terminate , and T47D cells . The EPB41L5 overexpression increased the num - ber of E - cadherin – positive vesicles in cytoplasm ( Fig . 7 , a and d ; Fig . S5 , b and j ) , and these vesicles coincided with the Rab5 - positive vesicles ( Fig . 7 , c and d ) ; Rab5 - positive vesicles were also enhanced by EPB41L5 overexpression ( Fig . 7 c ) . EPB41L5 mostly did not colocalize with these vesicles , but might colocalize with the vesicles beneath the membrane ( Fig . 7 , b and d ; Fig . S5 , f and j ) . Furthermore , the overexpression of EPB41L5 that lacked the N - terminal FERM domain did not induce the E - cadherin – positive vesicles ( Fig . 7 , e – h ; Fig . S5 , c , g , and k ) , whereas EPB41L5 with intact N - terminal and lacking the C - terminal ( EPB41L5 (cid:6) C ) did ( Fig . 7 , i – l ; Fig . S5 , d , h , and l ) . Of note is that membrane ruffl es and protrusions were enhanced in these epithelial cells over - expressing EPB41L5 ( Fig . 7 , a – d and i – l ; Fig . S5 ) . EPB41L5 interaction with integrin - associated adhesion components In TGF (cid:2) - treated NMuMG cells endogenous EPB41L5 also bound to (cid:2) 1 - integrin and paxillin , but not to FAK , talin , cortac - tin , or vinculin ( Fig . 8 a ) . Thus , we examined the possibility that EPB41L5 modulates the association between paxillin and inte - grin , and indeed , EPB41L5 did increase (cid:2) 1 - integrin binding to paxillin ( Fig . 8 b ) . The EPB41L5 binding to paxillin occurred through the C terminus of paxillin ( Fig . 8 c ) and through the C terminus of EPB41L5 ( Fig . 8 d ) . Thus , EPB41L5 interacts with Figure 6 .

JCB • VOLUME 182 • NUMBER 6 • 2008 1224 Discussion Upon EMT during gastrulation , the down - regulation of cell – cell adhesions must be tightly coordinated with the activation of cell – ECM interaction . EPB41L5 plays critical roles in this co - ordination , and this study proposes a “ displacement ” model for its function . EPB41L5 post - transcriptionally destabilizes E - cadherin by binding to p120ctn through its N - terminal FERM domain and reducing the association of p120ctn with E - cadherin . At the same time , EPB41L5 facilitates focal adhesion formation by binding to paxillin through its C - terminal domain and en - hancing paxillin association with integrin . The study has re - vealed a new aspect of the function of band 4 . 1 superfamily members , which are thought to function as scaffolds for integral membrane proteins . E - cadherin down - regulation in the EMT during mouse gastrulation is known to be regulated by Fgf signaling ; Fgf sig - naling up - regulates the expression of Snail , which acts as a tran - scriptional repressor inhibiting E - cadherin expression ( Batlle et al . , 2000 ; Cano et al . , 2000 ) . Fgf8 , Fgfr1 , or Snail mutants being scattered throughout the basal side of the cell body and abundant in fi lopodia and lamellipodia ( Fig . 9 , Ca and c ) . In the EPB41L5 siRNA - treated NIH3T3 cells (cid:3) 5 - integrin – positive struc - tures disappeared ( Fig . 9 Cb ) , and paxillin - positive structures were deformed in the center of the basal side of the cell body , and actin fi bers did not terminate in these structures ( Fig . 9 Cd ) . Focal adhesions were also scarce in EPB41L5 mutant primitive streak cells that crept out in culture ( Fig . 9 D ) . The above results indicate that EPB41L5 enhances paxillin / integrin interaction and consequently focal adhesion formation . Focal adhesions must dynamically turn over , and their enhance - ment could be incompatible with active cell movement and spreading as seen in EHD1 ( C - terminal Eps15 - homology [ EH ] domain - containing protein ) mutants ( Jovic et al . , 2007 ) . Therefore , FRAP analysis was conducted to examine the effects of EPB41L5 on focal adhesion turnover ( Iioka et al . , 2007 ) . Paxillin - positive fo - cal adhesions induced in T47D cells by EPB41L5 overexpression were actively turning over , while EPB41L5 siRNA greatly reduced the turnover of paxillin - positive structures in NIH3T3 and TGF (cid:2) - treated NMuMG cells ( Fig . 9 E ; unpublished data ) . Figure 7 . Effects of EPB41L5 on E - cadherin and Rab5 distribution . GFP - linked full - length EPB41L5 ( a – d ) , GFP - linked EPB41L5 that lacks N - terminal FERM domain ( e – h ) , or GFP - linked EPB41L5 that lacks C terminus ( i – l ) was co - transfected with myc - linked Rab5 ( to detect endosomes ) into epithelial NMuMG cells . ( a , e , and i ) Endogenous E - cadherin staining ( blue ) , ( b , f , and j ) GFP staining for EPB41L5 localization ( green ) , ( c , g , and k ) myc staining for Rab5 - positive endosomes ( red ) , and ( d , h , and l ) merged views . Conﬂ uent epithelial NMuMG cells , in the absence of TGF (cid:2) , uptake little DNA , and the rare cells that took up DNAs are marked by green and red among most cells that did not ( blue ) . myc - Rab5 itself has no effect on E - cadherin distribution ( e – h ) ( Palacios et al . , 2005 ) . In the NMuMG cells that took up full - length EPB41L5 ( a – d ) or EPB41L5 that lacks C terminus ( i – l ) , the number of E - cadherin – positive vesicles is increased in cytoplasm . The E - cadherin – positive vesicles coincided with Rab5 - positive endosomes ( d and l ) ; Rab5 - positive vesicles are also enhanced . EPB41L5 that lacks N - terminal FERM domain ( e – h ) does not increase cytoplasmic E - cadherin – positive vesicles . In each transfection more than 30 GFP - positive cells were examined , all of the cells showing the pattern of EPB41L5 , E - cadherin and Rab5 localization shown here . Bars , 30 μ m . Similar observations obtained with T47D cells are presented in Fig . S5 A . 1225 CADHERIN AND INTEGRIN CONTROL BY EPB41L5 • Hirano et al . RhoGTPase activity increases with EMT of NMuMG cells by TGF (cid:2) ; however , EPB41L5 siRNA did not affect the activities ( unpublished data ) . With the data obtained in this study we have proposed a “ displacement ” model for EPBL5 functions in cell – cell adhesions and cell – ECM adhesions . However , the possibil - ity that EPBL5 functions in Arf6 , RhoA , or another pathway cannot be excluded . A question in the “ replacement ” model is why EPBL5 does not affect N - cadherin / p120ctn interaction ( Fig . 6 g ) . Even if EPB41L5 is depleted , N - cadherin expression increases normally in invaginating mesoderm cells and TGF (cid:2) - treated NMuMG cells at the protein level ( Fig . 4 d ’ ; Fig . 2 Ab ) . Although the sequences for (cid:2) - catenin binding sites are highly conserved , those for p120ctn are conserved only moderately between E - and N - cadherins ( Kim et al . , 2000 ) ; it is possible that these cadherins have different af - fi nities to p120ctn . Hakai binds to the p120ctn binding site of E - cadherin , but not to this site of N - cadherin ; Hakai degrades E - cadherin but not N - cadherin ( Fujita et al . , 2002 ) . There is also a report suggesting that an extracellular domain makes N - cadherin different from E - cadherin with respect to functions in EMT and cell – ECM interactions ( Kim et al . , 2000 ) . This critical issue re - mains for future studies . Another question is the role of p120ctn in cell – ECM interaction ; this study suggests that EPB41L5 re - cruits p120ctn from E - cadherin – mediated cell – cell adhesions to the integrin / paxillin complex upon EMT . However , the study has not demonstrated any roles of p120ctn in the integrin / paxillin complex for cell – ECM adhesions . This is also an issue worthy of further examination . fail both to suppress E - cadherin and to induce a series of genes of mesoderm development at the transcriptional level ( Yamaguchi et al . , 1994 ; Sun et al . , 1999 ; Cano et al . , 2000 ) . However , in EPB41L5 mutants , the expression of Fgf8 , Snail , and other mesodermal markers did occur . At the mRNA level , E - cadherin expression was also shut off and integrin expression was enhanced . However , at the protein level , E - cadherin persisted and integrin did not appear in EPB41L5 - defi cient invaginating cells at primi - tive streak and TGF (cid:2) - treated NMuMG cells . Thus , EPB41L5 regulates E - cadherin and integrin expression post - transcription - ally . Because E - cadherin was down - regulated at the mRNA level , E - cadherin was eventually depleted in EPB41L5 mutant meso - derm cells ( Fig . 4 c ’ ) . On the other hand , (cid:3) 5 - integrin was never elevated in the mutant mesoderm cells ( Fig . 4 e ’ ) . EPB41L5 may stabilize integrin by increasing association with paxillin , and in its absence integrin may be readily degraded , despite the fact that integrin expression is seen at the mRNA level in the mutant mesoderm cells . Arf6 has been reported to function in both decrease of cell – cell adhesions by E - cadherin degradation and increase in integrin - mediated cell – ECM adhesions ( Sabe , 2003 ) . RohA pathway is also known to play key roles in regulation of cell – cell adhesions and cell – ECM adhesions ( Kaibuchi et al . , 1999 ; D ’ Souza - Schorey , 2005 ) . We have made intensive efforts to examine the possibility that EPB41L5 functions in these path - ways , but no data have been obtained to suggest such possibility . EPB41L5 does not bind to Arf6 ( Fig . 7 A ) , nor did EPB41L5 affect p120 catenin binding to RhoA or Rac1 ( unpublished data ) . Figure 8 .

JCB • VOLUME 182 • NUMBER 6 • 2008 1226 function in Crumbs - MPP5 complex for epithelial polarity in MDCK cells ( Gosens et al . , 2007 ) . However , the defects in the EPB41L5 mutant ectoderm and endoderm cells were found to include an increase in cell – cell contact , multi - cell stratifi cation , and loss of basement membrane . Defects in cell polarity were not apparent in EPB41L5 mutant epiblast , neuroectoderm , or en - doderm . Electron microscopic observations and marker analysis indicated that tight junction , adherens junction , and desmosome Drosophila Yurt and zebrafi sh Moe , the members of the EPB41L5 family , are negative regulators of Crb proteins , which control epithelial polarity and apical membrane size in embry - onic epithelia and photoreceptor cells ( Nelson , 2003 ; Jensen and Westerfi eld , 2004 ; Hsu et al . , 2006 ; Laprise et al . , 2006 ) .

( Ogata et al . , 2007 ) . However , p38IP and FLRT3 / Rnd1 do not participate in the enhancement of cell – ECM adhesions . In con - trast , EPB41L5 not only down - regulates E - cadherin but also activates integrin / paxillin association for cell – ECM interaction . p120ctn stabilizes E - cadherin at cell – cell contact sites , and its defi ciency causes rapid degradation of E - cadherin ( Ireton et al . , 2002 ; Davis et al . , 2003 ; Xiao et al . , 2007 ) . However , the role of p120ctn has never been suggested in the EMT during gastrulation . Molecular details of how E - cadherin destabilized by EPB41L5 is internalized into endosomes remain for future studies . Paxillin is a key component in focal adhesions , present - ing integrin on the cell surface and linking it to the cytoskeleton ( Kondo et al . , 2000 ; Hagel et al . , 2002 ) . EPB41L5 overexpression facilitated focal adhesion formation in T47D cells , while focal adhesions are deformed in NIH3T3 cells treated with EPB41L5 siRNA , and scarce in EPB41L5 mutant cells that emerged from the primitive streak . However , molecular mechanisms how the increase in paxillin / integrin association by EPB41L5 enhances focal adhesion turnover also remains for future studies . The details of post - translational coordination between the down - regulation of cadherin - mediated cell – cell interaction and the increase in integrin - mediated cell – ECM interaction on EMT are largely unknown . The molecular details of how EPB41L5 coordinate these two processes are of particular interest for future study . Band 4 . 1 superfamily members are known to maintain ep - ithelial integrity and to be tumor suppressors ( Sun et al . , 2002 ) . In the ERM family , merlin is the gene responsible for neuro - fi bromatosis 2 ( Rouleau et al . , 1993 ; Trofatter et al . , 1993 ) . DAL - 1 / Protein 4 . 1B and Protein 4 . 1R in the Band 4 . 1 family are also silenced in non - small cell lung carcinomas , neuroblastomas and other tumors ( Tran et al . , 1999 ; Gutmann et al . , 2000 ; Perry et al . , 2000 ; Huang et al . , 2001 ) . In contrast , in the EPB41L5 fam - ily , mouse EPB41L4b / Ehm2 was identifi ed as a gene expressed in high - metastatic K1735 murine melanoma cells ( Shimizu et al . , 2000 ) . The present results are strongly consistent with an onco - genic or metastatic function for EPB41L5 . Materials and methods Isolation of EPB41L5 EPB41L5 was isolated in our efforts to identify Otx2 targets with the TM library ( Murata et al . , 2004 ) ; the clone in the library is full - length cDNA of 2409 bp . Plasmids Arf1 - ﬂ ag , Arf6 - ﬂ ag , Hakai - ﬂ ag , and p120ctn - ﬂ ag expression vectors were constructed with pCAGGS - ﬂ ag vector ; E - cadherin - HA , N - cadherin - HA , EPB41L5 - HA , EPB41L5 (cid:6) C - HA , and EPB41L5 (cid:6) N - HA with pCAGGS - HA vector ; EPB41L5 - GFP , EPB41L5 (cid:6) C - GFP , and EPB41L5 (cid:6) N - GFP with pEGFP - C1 ( Clontech Laboratories , Inc . ) . p120ctn - myc , p120ctn (cid:6) N - myc , p120ctn (cid:6) C - myc , paxillin - GFP , paxillin (cid:6) C - GFP , and paxillin (cid:6) N - GFP were prepared previously ( Aono et al . , 1999 ; Yano et al . , 2004 ) . Cell culture NMuMG cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) , and the sources of T47D , NIH3T3 , and Cos7 cells are as described ( Yano et al . , 2004 ) . NIH3T3 , Cos7 , and whole embryonic cells were cul - tured in DMEM ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with 10 % FCS ; primitive streak was cultured in the same medium as described previously ( Zohn et al . , 2006 ) . The medium for NMuMG cell culture was further supplemented with 10 μ g / ml insulin and cultured as described previously ( Miettinen et al . , 1994 ) . T47D cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 ( Invitrogen ) supple - mented with 10 % FCS . To induce EMT , NMuMG cells were treated with form normally in EPB41L5 mutant epithelia . However , the pos - sibility cannot be excluded that EPB41L5 functions in epithelial polarity is complemented by EPB41L4b , another member of the EPB41L5 subfamily , which is also expressed during gastrulation ( unpublished data ) . The increase in cell number , along with multi - cell stratifi cation , in mutant E7 . 5 epiblast was not explained by the increase in cell proliferation , nor by the decrease in cell apop - tosis ; total cell number per embryo was also unchanged . This may also be the case in mutant E8 . 5 hypertrophic neuroepithelia . It seems likely that the increase in the cell number in epiblast or neuroepithelia is rather brought about by the inhibition of the transition of epiblast or neuroepithelium into mesoderm and en - doderm or neural crest cells , respectively . In vivo , EPB41L5 is not found ubiquitously in epithelial tissues at later stages as it is not in NMuMG or T47D cells . However , EPB41L5 is expressed in the entire embryonic epithelia in ectoderm and endoderm at peri - gastrulation ( Fig . S2 B ) . Why does it not induce EMT there ? Some aspects of EMT , such as increase in membrane ruffl ing and focal adhesions , were induced by EPB41L5 overexpression in epithelial NMuMG and T47D cells . Even in the epithelial monolayer , E - cadherin molecules dynamically turn over by endocytosis and recycling back to the plasma membrane ( D ’ Souza - Schorey , 2005 ; Xiao et al . , 2007 ) . Furthermore , interactions between the epithelial cells and base - ment membrane are essential to the maintenance of epithelial integrity . In addition , there must exist crosstalk between these cadherin - mediated cell – cell interaction and integrin - mediated cell – ECM interactions even in the epithelium ( Sakamoto et al . , 2006 ) . EPB41L5 must play roles in these processes in epithelial ectoderm and endoderm , as suggested by the increase in cell ad - hesion and loss of basement membrane in EPB41L5 mutant epi - thelial ectoderm and endoderm cells . However , the output of the EPB41L5 - mediated crosstalk is markedly different in epithelial ectoderm and mesenchymal mesoderm . There is no apparent change in the level of the EPB41L5 expression among cells of the three germ layers . It appears probable that EPB41L5 activity is not different in ectoderm and mesoderm cells . In ectoderm , E - cadherin is actively produced , and this may compensate for the E - cadherin destabilization by EPB41L5 , whereas in mesoderm cells E - cadherin is not produced at the mRNA level and residual E - cadherin protein in invaginating mesoderm cells may be read - ily degraded by EPB41L5 . In ectoderm , (cid:3) 5 - integrin is not pro - duced at the mRNA level , and EPB41L5 may be unable to activate focal adhesions , as it can in mesodermal cells which do generate this integrin . However , the possibility remains that an EMT signal activates EPB41L5 by an unknown mechanism . Recently NIK ( NCK - interacting kinase / Map4k4 ) and p38IP ( p38 interacting protein ) , which function in MAPK cas - cades , have been reported to down - regulate E - cadherin at the protein level ( Xue et al . , 2001 ; Zohn et al . , 2006 ) . Movement is inhibited in p38IP mutant mesoderm cells , and this is due to the failure in down - regulation of E - cadherin . EMT during gastrula - tion is also regulated by Activin / nodal signaling . FLRT3 ( fi bro - nectin leucine - rich repeat transmembrane 3 ) and small GTPase Rnd1 have recently been reported to modulate cell adhesion downstream in this pathway , and independent of FGF signaling , by down - regulating cell surface cadherin through endocytosis JCB • VOLUME 182 • NUMBER 6 • 2008 1228 RNA in situ hybridization analysis The probe to detect EPB41L5 was a 970 - bp fragment corresponding to its 3 (cid:4) part ( 596 – 731 aa ) .

Immunohistology was performed as described previously ( Yano et al . , 2004 ) . In brief , cells were ﬁ xed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 5 min at room temperature . Blocking was performed with 3 % BSA ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in PBS at room temperature for 1 h . The cells were incubated with primary antibody properly diluted with the blocking solution at room tem - perature for 1 h , and subsequently with the secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature . Samples were mounted in Vectorshield ( Vector Labra - tories ) . Images were analyzed using a laser scanning confocal microscope ( LSM510 ) mounted on an inverted microscope ( Axiovert 100M ) , using Plan - Neoﬂ uar 40 × / 1 . 30 NA and Plan - Apochromat 63 × / 1 . 30 NA objec - tives ( Carl Zeiss , Inc . ) .

For wound - healing assay , monolayered cells were scratched 12 h after cell plating at a high cell density ( Hagel et al . , 2002 ) . Cell attachment assay ( Oh et al . , 1999 ) and cell aggre gation assay ( Takeichi , 1977 ) were performed as described previously . NMuMG , NIH3T3 , and T47D cells were transfected with control siRNA ( 60 nM ; Invitrogen ) , EPB41L5 siRNA duplexes ( 60 nM ) , or each EPB41L5 DNA ( 5 μ g unless otherwise indicated ) using Lipofectoamine2000 ( Invitrogen ) in Opti - MEM ( Invitrogen ) at the time of cell seeding , accord - ing to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . EPB41L5 siRNA duplexes used are 5 (cid:4) - CAGC ACAACACAACCUGAAGAUCUU - 3 (cid:4) and 5 (cid:4) - AAGAUCUUCAG - GUUGUGUUGUGCUG - 3 (cid:4) . Cos7 cells were transfected with DNAs ( 5 μ g unless otherwise indicated ) using Polyfect Transfection Reagent ( QIAGEN ) at 12 h after plating and assayed after another 24 - h culture . Construction of targeting vector A BAC clone , RP23 - 443K20 , which contains the translational start site of the EPB41L5 gene was obtained from BACPAC Resources ( http : / / bacpac . chori . org / ) , and targeting and control vectors were constructed as described previously ( Murata et al . , 2004 ) . Primers used were the 37 - bp pI ( 5 (cid:4) - CAG - AAA GGTTAC TAGTTGAGACTCTGGTGAGATCAGG - 3 (cid:4) ) and 26 - bp pII ( 5 (cid:4) - AACTCACCGGGACTATAGGGGTCACC - 3 (cid:4) ) sequences to amplify the 5 . 3 - kb 5 (cid:4) arm of the targeting vector , the 25 - bp pIII ( 5 (cid:4) - GACCCACTC - GCTAGCTGCCATCTGC - 3 (cid:4) ) and 37 - bp pIV ( 5 (cid:4) - GACTGG CCTGCA TC - ACCTCCAACAGCCAGAACTTACG - 3 (cid:4) ) sequences to amplify the 4kb 3 (cid:4) arm of the targeting vector , and pIII and pV ( 5 (cid:4) - GCCAAG CCTGCA T - CAACTCCAACAGTTAGCAATTACC - 3 (cid:4) ) to amplify the 4 . 8 - kb 3 (cid:4) arm of the control vector . Their locations are indicated in Fig . S1 A . The six underlined nucleotides in pI , pIV , and pV sequences were converted into AscI and XhoI recognition sequences , GTCGAC and CTCGAG , respectively , to generate each primer . The ampliﬁ ed products were digested by each restriction en - zyme : AscI and NotI for the 5 . 3 - kb 5 (cid:4) arm , SpeI and XhoI for the 4 - kb 3 (cid:4) arm , and SpeI and NotI for the 4 . 8 - kb 3 (cid:4) arm , respectively . To construct the targeting vector , the 5 (cid:4) 5 . 3 - kb and 3 (cid:4) 4 - kb arms were inserted into the AscI / NotI sites and NheI / XhoI sites of 5 (cid:4) and 3 (cid:4) cloning sites , respectively , of the LacZ / Neo - DTA vector ( Murata et al . , 2004 ) . To construct the control vector , the 3 (cid:4) 4 . 8 - kb arm was inserted into the SpeI / NotI sites of the 3 (cid:4) cloning site of the LacZ / Neo vector . In the targeting vector and thus in the homologous recombinant a 2 . 4 - kb region between pII and pIII sequences was replaced with the LacZ / Neo cassette . Generation and housing of EPB41L5 mutant mice Homologous recombinant ES cells were isolated , and EPB41L5 mu - tant mice ( accession no . CDB0032K ; http : / / www . cdb . riken . jp / arg / mutant % 20mice % 20list . html ) were generated as described previously ( Murata et al . , 2004 ) . Mice were housed in an environmentally controlled room following the CDB guidelines for animal experiments . Genotyping and phenotyping of mice Southern hybridization was performed with 3 (cid:4) and 5 (cid:4) probes located outside of the regions used in the targeting vector ( Fig . S1 A ) as well as the neo probe as described previously ( Murata et al . , 2004 ) . Genotypes of mice and embryos were determined routinely by PCR with genomic DNAs from tails or yolk sacs . Primers used were p3 ( 5 (cid:4) - GGACGGTACA - GATGTCAGTGTGG - 3 (cid:4) ) and p4 ( 5 (cid:4) - CTGTACTCCCACATT GGCAGC - 3 (cid:4) ) to detect wild - type allele and p5 ( 5 (cid:4) - GAATGG AAGGATTGG AGC - TACGG - 3 (cid:4) ) and p4 to detect mutant allele ; their locations are indicated in Fig . S1 A . Histological analysis was performed as described previ - ously ( Murata et al . , 2004 ) . RT - PCR analysis 1 (cid:7) g of total RNAs from E8 . 5 brain was subjected to RT - PCR analysis . The cDNA synthesis was performed using ReverTra - Plus ( TOYOBO ) , following the protocol provided by the manufacturer . The purity and the quantity of the cDNAs were analyzed with GAPDH - speciﬁ c primers : GAPDH - sense ( 5 (cid:4) - TGTCATCAACGGGAAGCCCA - 3 (cid:4) ) and GAPDH - antisense ( 5 (cid:4) - TTGTCATG - GATGACCTTGGC - 3 (cid:4) ) . Primers used to detect EPB41L5 transcripts were : R1 ( 5 (cid:4) - GGCCTCTGCAGACTGGGACTCC - 3 (cid:4) ) , R2 ( 5 (cid:4) - GGTGACCGCC - GAGAGGCCAAGC - 3 (cid:4) ) , R3 ( 5 (cid:4) - AGCTGAGGAGGTTTCTGTCCAG - 3 (cid:4) ) , R4 ( 5 (cid:4) - TTCCCCCGGCTAGGCTTAGAGG - 3 (cid:4) ) , F ( ACCATCCTGACGTC - CACCCCAG ) , and R ( GTGGTGCTGGTGCTGATG CTGG ) ; the locations of each primer are indicated in Fig . S1 A and Fig . 1 Aa . The ampliﬁ ca - tion conditions were : pretreatment , 2 min at 94 ° C ; PCR , 25 cycles ( de - naturation , 15 s at 95 ° C ; annealing , 30 s at 58 ° C ; extension , 90 s at 72 ° C ) ; post - treatment , 7 min at 72 ° C . The sizes of PCR products were 350 bp with the R1 / R2 , 500 bp with the R3 / R4 , 214bp with F / R , and 305 bp with GAPDH - sense / antisense primer sets , respectively . 1229 CADHERIN AND INTEGRIN CONTROL BY EPB41L5 • Hirano et al .
