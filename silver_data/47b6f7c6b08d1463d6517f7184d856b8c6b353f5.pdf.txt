However , the mechanisms that provide tight spatiotemporal control of actin disassembly remain poorly understood . Here , we show that yeast coronin ( Crn1 ) makes a unique contribution to this process by differentially interact - ing with and regulating the effects of coﬁlin on ATP / ADP + P i versus ADP actin ﬁlaments . Crn1 potently blocks coﬁlin severing of newly assembled ( ATP / ADP + P i ) ﬁlaments but synergizes with coﬁlin to sever older ( ADP ) ﬁlaments . Thus , Crn1 has qualitatively distinct / opposite effects on actin dynamics depend - ing on the nucleotide state of actin . This bimodal mechanism requires two separate actin - binding domains in Crn1 . Consistent with these activities , Crn1 excludes GFP - Cof1 from newly assembled regions of actin networks in vivo and accelerates cellular actin turnover by four fold . We conclude that coronin polarizes the spatial distribution and activity of coﬁlin to promote selective disassembly of older actin ﬁlaments . INTRODUCTION Maintaining ﬁlamentous actin networks in a state of rapid ﬂux permits cells to remodel their actin cytoskeletons with speed and precision , and to replenish the assembly - competent pool of actin monomers available for new growth . Dynamic actin turn - over is therefore essential for most actin - based cellular processes ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . ADF / coﬁlin ( referred to herein as coﬁlin ) plays a central role in this process by promoting severing and depolymerization of ﬁlaments ( Bamburg , 1999 ) . In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , coﬁlin is encoded by an essential gene ( COF1 ) , andpartialloss - of - functionmutations withreduced binding to F - actin ( e . g . , cof1 - 22 ) cause slower cell growth and reduced rates of actin turnover ( Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ; Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ; Okada et al . , 2006 ) . Although coﬁlin is a central player in the regulation of actin disassembly , it does not act alone , but rather in concert with a number of other conserved actin - binding proteins , including Aip1 , Srv2 / CAP , twinﬁlin , and coronin . Growing evidence suggests that each of these proteins makes a unique and important contribution to actin disassembly . However , the speciﬁc roles of each protein and their underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood . Coronins are a widely expressed family of actin - binding proteins that localize to sites of dynamic actin remodeling ( de Hostos , 1999 ; Uetrecht and Bear , 2006 ) . They have a three - part structure ( see Figure 1C ) , consisting of an N - terminal b propeller domain that binds F - actin , a ‘‘unique’’ middle region that varies in sequence and length , and a C - terminal coiled - coil ( CC ) domain that mediates homo - oligomerization and Arp2 / 3 complex binding . Coronin is important for phagocytosis , endocytosis , cell motility , embryonic development , and immune function ( reviewedinUetrechtandBear , 2006 ; Fogeretal . , 2006 ) . Howco - roninmechanisticallycontributestotheseprocesseshasonlyjust begun to come into focus , and it appears to involve effects on both actin assembly and disassembly . Puriﬁed coronin directly regulates the actin - nucleating Arp2 / 3 complex ( Humphries et al . , 2002 ) , and this regulation is required for proper cell motility and immune function ( Cai et al . , 2005 , 2007b ; Foger et al . , 2006 ) . Coronin also inﬂuences actin disassembly . This was ﬁrst sug - gested by genetic interactions between crn1 D and mutants with reduced actin turnover ( act1 - 159 and cof1 - 22 ) ( Goode et al . , 1999 ) . More recently , Coronin - 1A and Aip1 were isolated asfactorsthatpromotecoﬁlin - dependentdisassemblyof Listeria actin tails ( Brieher et al . , 2006 ) . Together , coronin , Aip1 , and coﬁ - lin induce dramatic bursts of disassembly from actin ﬁlament endsbyamechanismyettoberesolved ( Kuehetal . , 2008 ) . More - over , knockdown of Coronin - 1B in ﬁbroblasts decreases rates of actin turnover ( Cai et al . , 2007b ) , and Coronin - 1B promotes de - branching of ﬁlaments nucleated by the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Cai et al . , 2008 ) . Unexpectedly , puriﬁed Coronin - 1B inhibits coﬁlin - mediated disassembly of F - actin in vitro ( Cai et al . , 2007a ) , which appears to be at odds with all of the observations mentioned above . This has left the role of coronin in actin turnover unclear . Here , we resolve this paradox , showing that coronin and coﬁlin cooperate conditionally to promote actin disassembly . RESULTS Crn1 Accelerates Actin Turnover In Vivo To better understand the in vivo role of coronin in actin disas - sembly , we ﬁrst examined the effects of deleting CRN1 on yeast 364 Molecular Cell 34 , 364 – 374 , May 15 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . cell growth and actin turnover . Isogenic wild - type ( CRN1 ) , crn1 D , cof1 - 22 , and crn1 D cof1 - 22 strains were generated and compared for growth at different temperatures ( 16 (cid:2) C – 37 (cid:2) C ) . Consistent with previous reports ( Goode et al . , 1999 ) , crn1 D grew similarily to wild - type cells at all temperatures , whereas cof1 - 22 cells was partially impaired for growth at 34 (cid:2) C ( Figure 1A ) and failed to grow at 37 (cid:2) C ( data not shown ) . The crn1 D cof1 - 22 cells showed a more severe growth defect at 34 (cid:2) C than cof1 - 22 cells ( Figure 1A ) . This synthetic defect was complemented by full - length ( FL ) coronin expressed from its endogenous promoter on a CEN plasmid ( Figure 1B ) . A construct lacking the coiled - coil domain ( D CC ) only partially rescued the synthetic defect . This suggests that both the CC and N - terminal regions of CRN1 contribute to its functions that are genetically shared with COF1 . Next , we compared rates of actin turnover in wild - type and crn1 D cells . Yeast cables and patches are highly dynamic F - actin structures that undergo continuous assembly and disassembly ( Moseley and Goode , 2006 ) . Treatment of cells with latrunculin A ( LatA ) , which sequesters actin monomers and blocks new assembly , causes the disappearance of cables and patches at rates proportional to disassembly / turnover ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) . Thus , the kinetics of actin disappearance at a ﬁxed concentration of LatA can provide a quantitative index for comparing rates of actin turnover between strains ( Lappalainen Figure1 . Effectsof crn1 D onActinTurnover In Vivo ( A ) Yeast strains compared for growth at 34 (cid:2) C on YPD . ( B ) Complementation of crn1 D cof1 - 22 growth defects by plasmid expression of Crn1 ( D CC ) or Crn1 ( FL ) . Transformants were serially diluted and spotted on selective medium .

Strains were treated with indicated amounts of LatA . Samples removed at time points were ﬁxed and stained with Alexa 488 - phalloidin . Cells ( n > 200 ) were scored for ( D ) visible cables or ( E and G ) patches . Data shown ( mean ± SD ) were obtained from two experiments . ( F ) Representative cells from ( E ) . ( H ) Representative cells from ( G ) . ( I ) The average F - actin intensity per cell was calculated by using ImageJ software ( n > 50 cells for each data point ) . and Drubin , 1997 ; Okada et al . , 2006 ) . The time to reach 50 % loss of cables was < 30 s in wild - type cells , and (cid:3) 4 - fold longer in crn1 D cells ( 120 s ) ( Figure 1D ) . Ratesofpatchturnoverwerealsoreduced in crn1 D cells ( Figures1E and1F ) . Consis - tent with these results , deletion of CRN1 conferred LatA resistance to cells in a halo assay , which measures the extent to which LatA spotted on a paper disc inhibits growth of the surrounding cells on the plate ( data not shown ) . In addition , we compared the patch turnover rates of cof1 - 22 and crn1 D cof1 - 22 strains and found that deletion of CRN1 further reduced actin turnover by at least 4 - fold in the cof1 - 22 background ( Figures 1G and 1H ) . Furthermore , crn1 D cof1 - 22 and cof1 - 22 strains had similar total F - actin ﬂuorescence per cell before LatA treatment ( Figure 1I ) . This shows that the increased LatA resistance of patches in crn1 D cof1 - 22 cells was due to reduced actin turnover rather than to a difference in the starting size / intensity of patches . Crn1 Antagonizes the Effects of Coﬁlin on ATP / ADP + P i Actin To address the mechanism underlying our in vivo observations described above , we puriﬁed Crn1 ( FL ) from Escherichia coli and tested its effects on Cof1 - mediated disassembly of pyr - ene - labeled actin ﬁlaments . Because some coﬁlins quench the ﬂuorescence of pyrene - labeled F - actin upon binding ( Blanchoin and Pollard , 1999 ; Carlier et al . , 1997 ) , a loss of ﬂuorescence can arise from coﬁlin binding rather than ﬁlament disassembly . Therefore , we ﬁrst measured the quenching effects of a wide range of Cof1 concentrations on 2 m M preformed pyrene - labeled F - actin . Cof1 caused concentration - dependent quenching , with maximal effect ( > 90 % ) at equimolar coﬁlin : actin ( Figure 2A ) . Molecular Cell Coronin’s Regulation of Coﬁlin Molecular Cell 34 , 364 – 374 , May 15 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . 365 Importantly , at 125 nM Cof1 , which was used in all of the disas - sembly assays described below , there was minimal quenching ( 9 % ) . We further controlled for quenching by premixing coﬁlin with the pyrene - labeled ﬁlaments for 5 min to allow ﬂuorescence to equilibrate before initiating disassembly by addition of the actin monomer sequestering Vitamin D - binding protein ( DBP ) . Crn1 had no quenching effects on pyrene - actin . Thus , the observed decrease in ﬂuorescence in these assays was due to disassembly and not quenching . As expected , Cof1 ( 125 nM ) increased the rate of disassembly of F - actin ( 2 m M ) ( Figure 2B ) . However , these effects of Cof1 were inhibited by Crn1 ( FL ) in a concentration - dependent manner ( Figure 2D ; Figure S1 , available online ) . Samples of the reactions in Figure 2B were removed at 1700 s and 15 hr and were analyzed by high - speed pelleting ( Figure 2C ) . At 1700 s , Cof1 shifted most of the actin to the supernatant , which could be due to full depolymerization and / or fragmentation of ﬁlaments into short oligomers . Crn1 ( FL ) blocked these effects . However , Figure 2 .

Molecular Cell Coronin’s Regulation of Coﬁlin 366 Molecular Cell 34 , 364 – 374 , May 15 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . after prolonged incubation ( 15 hr , Figure 2C ) , actin shifted to the supernatant in all reactions , indicating that although Crn1 ( FL ) can attenuate the effects of Cof1 , it does not ultimately prevent actin disassembly . Because the disassembly assay described above does not discern between the effects of Cof1 in severing ﬁlaments versus accelerating subunit dissociation from ﬁlament ends , we next tested the effects of Cof1 on pyrene - actin assembly , which is sensitive to severing , but not to depolymerization . Gel - ﬁltered actin monomers spontaneously assemble into ﬁlaments inefﬁ - ciently in the absence of nucleation factors . However , coﬁlin severs ﬁlaments to amplify free barbed ends and thereby dramatically increases the rate of actin assembly . Consistent with the cooperative properties of animal and plant coﬁlins ( Bamburg , 1999 ) , yeast Cof1 caused a concentration - dependent and cooperative increase in the rate of actin assembly ( Figures S2A and S2B ) . Similar effects were observed for Cof1 in the pres - ence of high concentrations of proﬁlin ( Figures S2C and S2D ) , which blocks pointed - end growth ( Pring et al . , 1992 ) , demon - strating that barbed - end growth was being measured . At a ﬁxed concentration of Cof1 ( 250 nM ) , the further addition of Crn1 ( FL ) led to a concentration - dependent decrease in the rate of actin assembly ( Figures 2E and 2F ) , demonstrating that Crn1 ( FL ) inhibits Cof1 - mediated severing and ampliﬁcation of barbed ends . We considered that the inhibitory effects of Crn1 ( FL ) might stem from the ability of Crn1 to bundle F - actin ( Goode et al . , Figure 3 .

However , addition of another bundling protein , Sac6 / ﬁmbrin , did not affect coﬁlin activity ( Figure S3 ) , suggesting that ﬁlament cross - linking is not the underlying cause for Crn1’s inhibition of Cof1 . The results from bulk assembly assays described above were conﬁrmed independently by using total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy , visualizing the effects of Cof1 and Crn1 ( FL ) on individual actin ﬁlaments ( Figures 2G and 2H ) . The assembly of Alexa 488 - labeled ATP - actin monomers alone or with Cof1 and / or Crn1 ( FL ) was monitored in real time ( Figure 2G ) , and effects on average ﬁlament length were quan - tiﬁed ( Figure 2H ) . Cof1 produced short ﬁlaments ( Movie S2 ) , whereas further addition of Crn1 ( FL ) antagonized this effect ( Movie S4 ) , producing longer ﬁlaments similar to actin alone and Crn1 ( FL ) reactions ( Movies S1 and S3 ) . Thus , our bulk kinetic and single ﬁlament data are in close agreement , showing that Crn1 ( FL ) antagonizes Cof1 - mediated severing . An Actin - Binding Site Located in the Coiled - Coil Domain of Crn1 Antagonizes Coﬁlin To better understand the basis for Crn1 ( FL ) inhibition of Cof1 , we dissected the activity by purifying Crn1 ( CC ; residues 601 – 651 ) andCrn1 ( D CC ; residues1 – 600 ) . Crn1 ( CC ) showedeffectssimilar toCrn1 ( FL ) , inhibitingCof1 - mediatedactinassemblyinaconcen - tration - dependent manner ( Figures 3A and 3B ) ; however , higher concentrations of Crn1 ( CC ) were required for these effects compared to Crn1 ( FL ) . These results were conﬁrmed indepen - dently by TIRF microscopy ( Figures 3C and 3D ; Movies S5 – S8 ) . The observations described above suggested that the CC domain alone may be capable of binding to F - actin and thereby blocking the effects of coﬁlin . Consistent with this possibility , Crn1 ( CC ) exhibited concentration - dependent binding to F - actin in cosedimentation assays ( Figure 3E ) . Thus , the CC domain harbors a second actin - binding site , distinct from the actin - binding site in the b propeller domain . The binding afﬁnity of Crn1 ( CC ) for F - actin was weaker ( micromolar range ; data not shown ) than that of Crn1 ( FL ) ( nanomolar range ) ( Goode et al . , 1999 ) . However , this was expected given that Crn1 ( FL ) has two actin - binding sites ( b propeller and CC ) contributing to F - actin afﬁnity . The weaker afﬁnity of the CC domain alone explains Molecular Cell Coronin’s Regulation of Coﬁlin Molecular Cell 34 , 364 – 374 , May 15 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . 367 the observed requirement for higher concentrations of Crn1 ( CC ) compared to Crn1 ( FL ) to inhibit Cof1 . Furthermore , Crn1 ( CC ) and Cof1 appear to compete for binding to F - actin ( see ATP - actin curves in Figures 6H and 6I ) , offering a mechanistic expla - nation for the inhibitory effects of Crn1 . These CC domain - actin interactions may be conserved in other species , as larger CC domain - containing fragments of mammalian Coronin - 1A and Coronin - 3 have been reported to bind F - actin ( Liu et al . , 2006 ; Spoerl et al . , 2002 ) . Crn1 ( D CC ) Synergizes with Coﬁlin to Sever Actin Filaments We next tested the activities of Crn1 ( D CC ) . This polypeptide alone had no obvious effects in DBP - induced disassembly Figure 4 .

( H ) An integrated crn1 D CC allele complements crn1 D cof1 - 22 synthetic growth defects at 34 (cid:2) C . assays ( Figure 4A ) , as previously reported ( Goode et al . , 1999 ) . Surprisingly , combining Crn1 ( D CC ) and Cof1 led to a faster rate of F - actin disassembly compared to Cof1 alone , suggesting their synergy in promoting actin disassembly . As in Figure 2C , disassembly into monomers and / or short oligo - mers was conﬁrmed by high - speed pelletting ( Figure 4B ) . Synergy between Crn1 ( D CC ) and Cof1 was also observed in dilution - induced disas - sembly assays ( Figure S4A ) . To address synergy in ﬁlament severing , the effects of Crn1 ( D CC ) and Cof1 were tested in pyr - ene - actin assembly assays . Crn1 ( D CC ) alone caused only a minor increase in the rate of actin assembly ( Figures 4C and 4D ) , consistent with previous observations ( Goode et al . , 1999 ) , but when combined with Cof1 caused a robust concentration - dependent increase in the rate of actin assembly ( Figures 4C and 4D ) . These effects were not altered by the presence of proﬁlin ( Figures S2C and S2D ) , demonstrating that Crn1 ( D CC ) and Cof1 synergize to amplify free barbed ends . As an independent test for severing , we measured the produc - tion of free barbed ends in a two - step seeded assembly assay ( Figure 4E ) . Monomeric actin ( 2 m M ) was ﬁrst assembled in the presence or absence of Cof1 and Crn1 ( D CC ) ( inset , Figure 4E ) . Then , samples were removed at 25 % polymer mass assembly ( dotted line , inset ) and added to a second reaction containing 0 . 5 m M actin monomers . Filaments generated in the ﬁrst reaction acted as ‘‘seeds’’ for polymerization in the second reaction , and the rate of assembly was directly proportional to the concentra - tion of free barbed ends produced in the ﬁrst reaction . The rate of actin assembly was minimal upon addition of actin alone or actin + Crn1 ( D CC ) seeds generated in the ﬁrst reactions , but increased dramatically when the ﬁrst reactions contained Cof1 or Cof1 + Crn1 ( D CC ) . Because seeding the second reactions Molecular Cell Coronin’s Regulation of Coﬁlin 368 Molecular Cell 34 , 364 – 374 , May 15 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . introduced low concentrations of Cof1 and / or Crn1 ( D CC ) , we included control reactions containing the same ﬁnal concentra - tions of Cof1 and / or Crn1 ( D CC ) ( without seeds ) . No actin assembly was detected in these reactions ( control curves 2 , 3 , and 4 ) , demonstrating that the increase in the rate of assembly caused by Cof1 and Crn1 ( D CC ) was due to ampliﬁcation of barbed ends in the ﬁrst reaction . The effects , quantiﬁed by measuring the slopes of the seeded curves in Figure 4E and sub - tractingtheslopesofthecorrespondingcontrolcurves , indicated that Crn1 ( D CC ) enhances Cof1 severing by (cid:3) 4 - fold ( Figure 4F ) . Severing was also assessed by removing samples early in the ﬁrst reactions ( dotted line , Figure 4E , inset ) and visually comparing the lengths of ﬁlament seeds ( n > 100 ﬁlaments for each reaction , Figure 4G ) . Crn1 ( D CC ) reduced the average ﬁla - mentlengthby1 . 7 - fold ( 5 . 0 m m , comparedto8 . 8 m minactinalone reactions ) . Cof1 reduced the average length to a greater extent ( 3 - fold ) , yielding ﬁlaments with an average length of 2 . 86 m m . Combining Cof1 and Crn1 ( D CC ) produced very short ﬁlaments ( 0 . 94 m m ) , consistent with synergy in severing . These differences were signiﬁcant ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Furthermore , because very short ﬁla - ments are difﬁcult to detect by this method , these values may not reﬂect the full extent of synergy between Cof1 and Crn1 ( D CC ) . As another non - pyrene - based test for severing and disas - sembly , we incubated unlabelled F - actin with Crn1 ( D CC ) and / or Cof1 for 5 min and stained ﬁlaments with Alexa 488 - phalloidin ( Figure S4B ) . Average ﬁlament lengths were measured ( n > 100 ﬁlaments for each reaction ) and found to be similar in reactions containing F - actin ( 13 . 5 m m ) and F - actin + Crn1 ( D CC ) ( 12 . 4 m m ) , but signiﬁcantly shorter in reactions containing F - actin + Cof1 ( 4 . 3 m m ) and even shorter in reactions containing F - actin + Crn1 ( D CC ) + Cof1 ( 2 . 5 m m ) ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Collectively , the multiple lines of biochemical evidence shown above demonstrate that Crn1 ( D CC ) synergizes with Cof1 to sever actin ﬁlaments . Consistent with these activities , expres - sion of an integrated copy of crn1 D CC partially complemented the synthetic growth defects at 34 (cid:2) C observed for the crn1 D cof1 - 22 strain ( Figure 4H ) . Synergy with Coﬁlin Depends on Binding of Crn1 ( D CC ) to F - Actin To address the basis of Crn1 ( D CC ) - Cof1 synergy , we tested whether these two proteins associate . However , no interactions between Crn1 and Cof1 were detected by gel ﬁltration , sedimenta - tion velocity analysis , or two - hybrid analysis ( data not shown ) . This raised the possibility that Crn1 ( D CC ) may instead synergize with coﬁlin by an indirect mechanism involving its interactions with F - actin . To test this model , we characterized the effects of two separate Crn1 ( D CC ) polypeptides ( Crn1 - 2 and Crn1 - 6 ) carrying point mutations in their b propeller domains that impair F - actin binding ( Figures 5A and 5B ) . These alleles were identiﬁedin a study mappingcoronin - actin - bindinginteractions ( M . G . andB . G . , unpub - lished data ) . Unlike wild - type Crn1 ( D CC ) , Crn1 - 2 and Crn1 - 6 polypeptides failed to synergize with Cof1 in accelerating actin assembly ( Figures 5C and 5D ) or disassembly ( data not shown ) . These results show that the synergy between Crn1 and Cof1 in severing requires Crn1 b propeller domain binding to F - actin . We next tested whether Crn1 ( D CC ) can recruit Cof1 to F - actin in cosedimentation assays ( Figures 5E and 5F ) and found that Crn1 ( D CC ) modestly increases Cof1 association with F - actin ( by (cid:3) 1 . 5 - fold ; p < 0 . 01 ) . Tocontrolforminordifferencesinthelevel of actin found in the pellets between reactions , we independently normalized the percentage of Cof1 bound to the level of actin in the pellet . However , this yielded a similar 1 . 5 - fold difference ( datanotshown ) . Thesedataareremarkablyconsistentwiththose showing that mammalian Coronin - 1A increases coﬁlin associa - tion with F - actin by 1 . 5 - fold ( Brieher et al . , 2006 ) . However , this 1 . 5 - fold increase in coﬁlin binding does not easily explain the ability of coronin to increase coﬁlin severing activity in vitro by 4 - fold , or increase the rate of actin turnover in vivo by 4 - fold . The Nucleotide State of Actin Determines the Regulatory Effects of Coronin We next addressed the apparent inconsistency between our in vivo data pointing to Crn1 and Cof1 synergy in promoting actin Figure 5 .

A similar discrepancy was reported for mamma - lian Coronin - 1B , in which genetic data suggest cooperation between coronin and coﬁlin in driving actin turnover in ﬁbro - blasts , yet puriﬁed full - length Coronin - 1B inhibited coﬁlin severing in vitro ( Cai et al . , 2007a , 2007b ) . This paradox , span - ning yeast and mammalian systems , combined with our obser - vations described above showing that coronin has two separate actin - binding domains with markedly different effects on coﬁlin , led us to consider whether the effects of coronin on coﬁlin activity might be conditional . Actin networks are rich in ATP / ADP + P i - actin near their newly assembled ( leading ) ends and become increasingly rich in ADP - actin at their older ( trailing ) ends . Therefore , we investigated whether the nucleotide state of F - actin might inﬂuence the effects of coronin on coﬁlin . First , we compared the effects of Crn1 ( FL ) on the Cof1 - medi - ated assembly of ATP - actin versus ADP - actin . ADP - actin was used at a higher concentration than ATP - actin due to its slower rate of assembly , but a constant molar ratio of actin : Cof1 : Crn1 ( FL ) was used . Remarkably , although Crn1 ( FL ) almost completely blocked Cof1 - stimulated ATP - actin assembly ( Figure 6A ) , it synergized with Cof1 in stimulating ADP - actin assembly ( Figure 6B ) . These synergistic effects were concentra - tion dependent ( Figure 6C ) , and quantiﬁcation of the data in Figures 6A and 6B revealed that Crn1 ( FL ) and Cof1 each caused a3 - foldincreaseintherateofADP - actin assembly , whereastheir Figure 6 .

( I ) Sameas ( H ) , butusing3 m MCrn1 ( CC ) insteadof Crn1 ( FL ) . combined effect was a 9 - fold increase in the rate of assembly ( Figure 6D ) . Interest - ingly , Crn1 ( FL ) alone accelerated the assembly of ADP - actin ( Figure 6B ) , sug - gesting that it may sever ADP - actin ﬁla - ments in the absence of Cof1 . Indeed , Crn1 ( FL ) and Cof1 each signiﬁcantly ( p < 0 . 001 ) reduced the average length of preformed ﬁlaments in visual assays ( n > 100 ﬁlaments for each reaction ; Figure S5A ) from 8 . 4 m m ( F - actin alone reactions ) to 4 . 0 and 3 . 9 m m , respectively ; moreover , combining Crn1 ( FL ) and Cof1 further reduced the average length to 2 . 0 m m . Together , these data suggest that Crn1 ( FL ) and Cof1 can both independently sever ADP - actin ﬁlaments , and that their combined effects in severing are synergistic . Similar effects were observed independently by TIRF micros - copy , comparing Cof1 and Crn1 ( FL ) activities on ADP - actin ( Figures 6E and 6F ; Movies S9 – S12 ) . Cof1 produced numerous and shorter ADP - actin ﬁlaments compared to actin alone , and further addition of Crn1 ( FL ) did not antagonize Cof1 . Similar effects were observed for Crn1 ( CC ) ( Figures 6G and S5B ; Movies S13 – S16 ) . Together , our data from bulk and TIRF assays suggest that co - ronin has highly distinct effects on ADP - actin versus ATP / ADP + P i - actin , selectively blocking coﬁlin severing of ATP / ADP + P i actin , yet strongly enhancing the severing of ADP - actin . In turn , this suggests that the interactions of Crn1 ( FL ) with ATP / ADP + P i actin ﬁlaments must be qualitatively distinct from its interactions with ADP - actin ﬁlaments . Consistent with this view , Crn1 ( FL ) bound ATP / ADP + P i - F - actin with higher afﬁnity comparedtoADP - F - actin ( FigureS6 ) , asreportedformammalian Coronin - 1B ( Cai et al . , 2007a ) . Strong binding of Crn1 ( FL ) was Molecular Cell Coronin’s Regulation of Coﬁlin 370 Molecular Cell 34 , 364 – 374 , May 15 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . observed with 8 nM ATP / ADP + P i - F - actin , consistent with previous reports ( Goode et al . , 1999 ) , but little or no binding was detected with even 8 - fold higher concentrations of ADP - F - actin . Further supporting this view , Crn1 ( FL ) and Crn1 ( CC ) competed much more effectively with coﬁlin for binding to ATP / ADP + P i - F - actin compared to ADP - F - actin ( Figures 6H and 6I ) . Coronin Regulates the Spatial Distribution of Coﬁlin on Cellular Actin Networks Coﬁlin is largely excluded from newly assembled regions of actin networks , such as those found at the leading edge of mammalian cells ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) and the cortical edge of yeast cells ( Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ) . Our biochemical data described above suggested that Crn1 might inﬂuence coﬁlin distribution in vivo , helping to exclude coﬁlin from regions of active actin assembly rich in ATP / ADP + P i - actin . To test this model , we asked whether deletion of CRN1 affects the distribution of Cof1 on actin patches . Using multiwavelength live cell imaging in the sla2 D background ( which has elongated patches ) , we examined GFP - Cof1 distribution on Abp1 - RFP - Figure 7 . Crn1 Excludes GFP - Cof1 from Newly Assembled Regions of Actin Patches ( A ) Abp1 - RFP and GFP - Cof1 localization in sla2 D CRN1 + and sla2 D crn1 D strains ; representative images . ( B ) Quantiﬁcation of Abp1 - RFP and GFP - Cof1 ﬂuorescence intensities as a function of distance from the cell cortex ( three measurements aver - aged per actin patch ; n = 10 cells for each strain ) . ( C ) Working model for coronin function in actin disassembly with two separate actin - binding domains ( b propellerandCC ) . Atnewlyassembled regions of actin networks rich in ATP / ADP + P i - actin , the CC - actin interaction blocks coﬁlin binding and severing . At older regions of networks rich in ADP - actin , the CC - actin interaction no longer blocks coﬁlin binding , and the coronin b propeller synergizes with coﬁlin to sever ﬁla - ments . This model also depicts the CC domain binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex , which may locally disrupt CC - actin interactions to promote coﬁlin severing of ATP / ADP + P i - actin branches . marked actin patches and plotted their ﬂuorescence intensities versus distance from the cell surface ( n = 10 cells ; aver - ages plotted in Figure 7B ) as described ( Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ) . As previ - ously observed , in CRN1 + cells the GFP - Cof1 signal was notably diminished from the cell edge ( Figure 7A ) , and the peak of the GFP - Cof1 signal was shifted inward compared to the peak of the Abp1 - RFP signal ( Figure 7B , top panel ) . However , in crn1 D cells , the GFP - Cof1 signal was more uniformly distributed along the length of patches , with GFP - Cof1 and Abp1 - RFP signals having almost identical peaks ( Figures 7A and 7B , bottom panels ) . These data strongly support our model that coronin regulates the distribution and activity of coﬁlin on actin networks . We also observed a decrease in the GFP - Cof1 signal at the trailing ends of patches in crn1 D cells compared to CRN1 + cells , which may reﬂect a role for Crn1 in recruiting Cof1 to the nonactively growing regions of actin networks . DISCUSSION In this work , we describe a new mechanism by which coronin promotes the polarized disassembly of actin ﬁlaments . We show that coronin differentially regulates coﬁlin activity depend - ing on the nucleotide state of actin and controls the spatial distri - bution of coﬁlin on actin networks in vivo to accelerate actin turnover . A Bimodal Mechanism for Coronin Function Our data show that coronin’s regulation of actin disassembly depends on the nucleotide state of actin ( see model in Figure 7C ) . This mechanism requires two separate actin - binding Molecular Cell Coronin’s Regulation of Coﬁlin Molecular Cell 34 , 364 – 374 , May 15 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . 371 domains in coronin , which have highly distinct effects . Binding of the coronin CC domain to F - actin competitively blocks coﬁlin binding and severing of ATP / ADP + P i - actin , but not ADP - actin . Incontrast , bindingofthe b propellerdomainofcoronintoF - actin enhances coﬁlin severing . The observation that full - length coro - nin , which contains both actin - binding domains , inhibits coﬁlin severing of ATP / ADP + P i - actin ﬁlaments suggests that the inhib - itory effects of the CC domain are dominant over the synergistic effects of the b propeller domain . This view is supported further by our observation that Cof1 - mediated actin assembly is in - hibited in the combined presence of Crn1 ( FL ) and Crn1 ( D CC ) ( Figure S7 ) . Our data also suggest that inhibition does not stem from actin bundling ( Figure S3 ) , but instead is due to competitive binding between coﬁlin and the Crn1 - CC domain for ATP / ADP + P i - F - actin ( Figures 6H and 6I ) . Interestingly , the CC domain binds to ADP - F - actin ( data not shown ) , but does not competi - tively displace coﬁlin from ADP - F - actin ( Figure 6I ) . This suggests that the CC domain has a qualitatively distinct interaction with ADP - versus ATP / ADP + P i - F - actin . When bound to ATP / ADP + P i - F - actin , the CC domain may alter the actin ﬁlament conformation to inhibit coﬁlin binding . Consistent with this possi - bility , a recent study showed that Coronin - 1A decoration induces a ‘‘stabilizing’’ conformation in F - actin ( Galkin et al . , 2008 ) . Although many actin - binding proteins have been shown to have higher afﬁnity for either ATP / ADP + P i - actin or ADP - actin , coronin shows qualitatively distinct / opposite functional effects when bound to actin in different nucleotide states . This unique property allows coronin to selectively protect newly assembled regions of actin ﬁlaments and accelerate disassembly of older regions of actin ﬁlaments . The predicted sum of these effects is enhanced polarization ofactin network disassembly , inthedirec - tion of the older ﬁlaments . Coﬁlin has an inherent binding prefer - ence for ADP - actin ﬁlaments ( Kd = 0 . 6 m M ) over ADP + P i actin ﬁlaments ( Kd = 20 m M ) ( Blanchoin and Pollard , 1999 ) , which should skew its distribution toward ADP - actin ﬁlaments . However , evensparsedecorationofATP / ADP + P i - actinﬁlaments by coﬁlin may be sufﬁcient for severing . This concept is sup - ported by TIRF studies showing that low concentrations of coﬁlin are optimal for severing ( Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ) , and by our observation that low molar ratios of Cof1 to F - actin efﬁciently sever newly assembled ( ATP / ADP + P i ) ﬁlaments in both bulk and TIRF assays . Collectively , these observations raise a previously overlooked point , which is that , despite having a weaker binding afﬁnity for ATP / ADP + P i - actin compared to ADP - actin , coﬁlin nonetheless severs newly formed ﬁlaments unlesstheyareactivelyprotected . Weshowthatcoroninpotently blocks severing of ATP / ADP + P i - actin by coﬁlin , and thus selec - tively shields newly assembled regions of actin ﬁlaments . Consistent with the model described above , deletion of CRN1 reduced rates of actin turnover in vivo ( Figure 1 ) and reversed the normal exclusion of GFP - Cof1 from regions of active actin assembly in cortical actin patches ( Figures 7A and 7B ) . These functions of coronin may be conserved . Genetic disruption of Coronin - 1B in mammalian cells reduces the rate of leading edge retrograde actin ﬂow ( Cai et al . , 2007b ) . This effect was attributed to coronin’s recruitment of Slingshot phosphatase , which dephosphorylates coﬁlin to activate severing . However , part of these observed effects might have been due to interactions between Coronin - 1B and F - actin . Slingshot phosphatase is not conserved in all organisms in which coronin promotes actin turnover ( Huang et al . , 2006 ) , and in some organisms ( e . g . , S . cerevisiae ) , coﬁlin is not phospho - regulated ( Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) . Given that coronin - actin interactions are conserved across distant species , the direct effects of coronin on F - actin may provide a more general mechanism for regulating coﬁlin spatial distribution and function , with recruitment of Slingshot phosphatase providing a complementary mechanism that is necessary in systems in which coﬁlin is phosphorylated . Our data may also explain the apparently conﬂicting results from Brieher et al . ( 2006 ) showing that Coronin - 1A enhances coﬁlin - mediated disassembly of Listeria actin tails , and Cai et al . ( 2007a ) showing that puriﬁed Coronin - 1A and Coronin - 1B inhibit theeffectsofcoﬁlinonactin . Thisdiscrepancycouldbeexplained bydifferencesinthenucleotidestatesofactin . Caiandcoworkers used ﬁlaments newly assembled from ATP - actin , whereas Brieher and coworkers used Listeria tails likely to have been rich in ADP - actin near their older ends , consistent with the observed synergy between coronin and coﬁlin in disassembling the rear of tails . The latter study also found that Coronin - 1A increases coﬁlin association more substantially ( 4 - to 5 - fold ) on Listeria tails than on puriﬁed ﬁlaments assembled from ATP - actin ( 1 . 5 - fold ) ( Brieher et al . , 2006 ) , which again would be explained by distinct interactions of coronin with actin in different nucleotide states . In principle , the ability of Crn1 to enhance Cof1 - mediated actin assembly ( Figures 4 and 6 ) could be due to severing or nucle - ation . One recent study suggested that high concentrations of coﬁlin nucleate actin assembly ( Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ) . However , multiple lines of evidence argue that the mechanism underlying our observations is severing rather than nucleation . First , by using preformed ﬁlaments , Crn1 enhanced Cof1 - mediated severing and disassembly , effects that cannot be explained by nucleation . Second , Cof1 - dependent accelera - tion of actin assembly occurred at low ratios of coﬁlin to actin ( 1 : 8 ) , whereas the nucleation reported above required a vast excess of coﬁlin to actin ( 30 : 1 ) . Third , GFP - Cof1 is excluded from regions of active actin assembly in vivo , and arrives at actin patches after their assembly rather than during their assembly ( Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ) . Regulation of Coronin Activities The effects of coronin on actin disassembly may be regulated by additional factors besides the nucleotide state of actin . For instance , local inactivation of the CC domain of coronin by ligand binding or phosphorylation might drastically alter the effects of coronin on ATP / ADP + P i - actin , switching it from protecting ﬁla - ments to promoting severing . This would allow the b propeller domain of coronin to synergize with coﬁlin in severing ATP / ADP + P i - actin ﬁlaments , as we have observed it can ( Figure 4 ) . This possibility is intriguing in light of the interaction of the coronin CCdomainwiththeArp2 / 3complex ( Caietal . , 2007b ; Fogeretal . , 2006 ; Humphries et al . , 2002 ) . Perhaps Arp2 / 3 complex inactiva - tion of the CC domain could trigger local coronin - coﬁlin synergy , leading to targeted severing at branch points ( Figure 7C ) , which may help explain the recent observation that Coronin - 1B promotes ﬁlament debranching ( Cai et al . , 2008 ) . In addition , phosphorylation of coronin governs its association with the Molecular Cell Coronin’s Regulation of Coﬁlin 372 Molecular Cell 34 , 364 – 374 , May 15 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . Arp2 / 3 complex ( Cai et al . , 2005 , 2007b ) and possibly its role in actin disassembly . Finally , our observations may be mechanistically relevant to the recently described ‘‘bursting’’ mode of actin disassmbly , in which a three - component mixture of coﬁlin , Aip1 , and coronin was shown to induce abrupt and rapid loss of discrete lengths of polymer from the ends of newly assembled ATP - actin ﬁla - ments ( Kueh et al . , 2008 ) . When either Aip1 or Coronin was depleted from the mixture , bursting no longer occurred . Our observation that the coronin b propeller domain ( lacking the CC domain ) enhances coﬁlin - mediated severing of ﬁlaments newly polymerized from ATP - actin ( Figure 4 ) may underlie part of the bursting mechanism . Perhaps binding of Aip1 to ATP / ADP + P i - F - actin relieves full - length coronin’s inhibition of coﬁlin , triggering rapid severing . This would provide cells with a mecha - nism for disassembling newly polymerized ﬁlaments . Broad Implications The dynamic organization of actin ﬁlaments into polarized , higher - order structures requires the precise effects of multiple actin - binding proteins working in concert . How the activities of so many factors are orchestrated with spatiotemporal precision to balance polarized assembly and turnover of actin suprastruc - tures has remained elusive . One fundamental component of this mechanism is the changing nucleotide state of actin subunits as a function of polymer age . Many actin - associated proteins pref - erentially bind ATP / ADP + P i - actin or ADP - actin , which provides a mode of spatial regulation . Here , we have revealed a new dimension to nucleotide state - based regulation , demonstrating that one protein ( coronin ) can switch its functional effects on actin dynamics depending on the nucleotide state . Similar ‘‘role - switching’’ strategies may be widely employed by other actin - binding proteins to inﬂuence different aspects of actin dynamics . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES General All yeast strains and plasmids used are described in Supplemental Data . All p values reported were determined by using a two - tailed t test in Excel ( Micro - soft ) . Fluorescence Light Microscopy All images were acquired on a Zeiss Axioskop - 2 mot plus microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Thornwood , NY ) by using a Hamamatsu IEEE1394 digital CCD camera ( Hamamatsu Photonics , Bridgewater , NJ ) running OpenLab software ( Impro - vision , Lexington , MA ) . For in vivo actin turnover assays ( Figure 1 ) , cells were grown to log phase in 5 ml YPD cultures , pelletted , and resuspended in 1 ml YPD . A total of 100 – 200 m l cells were treated with LatA ( a gift from Phil Crews , University of California , Santa Cruz , CA ) at 30 (cid:2) C . At time points , 25 m l samples of cells were removed , ﬁxed , and stained with Alexa Fluor 488 - phalloidin ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) . For live cell imaging ( Figures 7A and 7B ) , sla2 D CRN1 + and sla2 D crn1 D strains with an integrated copy of Abp1 - RFP and carrying a low - copy plasmid expressing GFP - Cof1 ( see Supplemental Data for plasmid construction ) were grown in parallel at 25 (cid:2) C to early log phase in SD media lacking tryptophan . Abp1 - RFP and GFP - Cof1 signal intensities were quantiﬁed by using ImageJ ( NIH ) software . Protein Puriﬁcation Crn1 ( FL ) , Crn1 ( D CC ) , and Crn1 ( CC ) polypeptides were expressed as GST fusions in E . coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) and puriﬁed ( Goode et al . , 1999 ) . GST tags were removed from all Crn1 ( D CC ) polypeptides by thrombin digestion . Crn1 ( FL ) was isolated with and without the GST tag . The activities of Crn1 ( FL ) and Crn1 ( D CC ) polypeptides with and without GST tags were indistin - guishable in Cof1 - mediated actin assembly assays ( data not shown ) . Crn1 ( CC ) was isolated with its GST tag present . Recombinant S . cerevisiae Cof1 ( Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ) and S . cerevisiae proﬁlin ( Eads et al . , 1998 ) were puriﬁed from E . coli . ATP - bound rabbit skeletal muscle actin ( RMA ) was puriﬁed ( Spudich and Watt , 1971 ) and gel ﬁltered . ATP - RMA was labeled on Cys374 with pyrenyliodoacetamide ( Pollard and Cooper , 1984 ) or on lysines with Alexa 488 ﬂuorophor ( Isambert et al . , 1995 ) . To prepare pyrene - labeledandunlabeledADP - RMA , ATP - pyrene - RMAandATP - RMAwereincu - bated for 5 min on ice with AG1 - X2 beads ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) to remove free nucleotide , then treated with hexokinase ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) ( Pollard , 1986 ) to convert the bound nucleotide to ADP . Actin Assembly and Disassembly Kinetics Gel - ﬁltered RMA was used in all assays . Pyrene signal was monitored at 25 (cid:2) C in a ﬂuorescence spectrophotometer ( Photon Technology International , Law - renceville , NJ ) at excitation 365 nm and emission 407 nm . To analyze Cof1 quenching effects , actin ( 10 % pyrene labeled ) was polymerized in F - buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , and 0 . 7 mM ATP ) . For DBP - induced disassembly assays , 40 m l pre - formed F - actin ( 2 m M ﬁnal , 10 % pyrene labeled ) was incubated for 5 min with 20 m l protein or control buffer , then ( at time 0 ) disassembly was induced with 4 m M DBP ( human plasma Gc - globulin , Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) . Curves were normalized at time 0 . For assembly assays , monomeric actin ( 5 % pyrene labeled ) was converted to Mg - ATP - actin immediately before use in each reaction and mixed with 15 m l proteins or control buffer and 3 m l of 20 3 initiation mix ( 40 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM ATP , 1 M KCl ) in 60 m l reactions . Effects of Crn1 and / or Cof1 on actin assembly were similar when using RMA and yeast actin ( data not shown ) . Rates of assembly were calculated from slopes of curves at 25 % – 50 % polymerization . For seeded assays , 6 m l of the ﬁrst reaction ( assembly conditions were as described above ) was removed at 25 % polymerization and used to seed a second reaction ( 60 m l ) containing 0 . 5 m M monomeric actin ( 10 % pyrene labeled ) . To visualize F - actin products from assembly and disassembly assays , samples were removed and diluted 50 - fold into F - buffer plus 0 . 3 m M Alexa 488 - phalloidin . After 5 min , ﬁlaments were diluted another 50 fold , and 0 . 5 m l was applied to a nitrocellulose - coated coverslip . Filaments were examined by ﬂuorescence microscopy . F - Actin Cosedimentation Assays Different concentrations of F - actin were incubated for 10 min with proteins or control buffer , then centrifuged for 20 min at 80 , 000 rpm in a TLA100 rotor ( BeckmanInstruments , Fullerton , CA ) . Pelletsandsupernatantswereanalyzed on Coomassie - stained gels or western blotted with afﬁnity - puriﬁed chicken anti - Cof1 and anti - actin antibodies ( Okada et al . , 2006 ) or mouse anti - Crn1 antibodies ( Goode et al . , 1999 ) . Band intensities on gels and blots were quan - tiﬁed by using ImageJ software . TIRF Microscopy Protein mixtures were diluted in freshly prepared ﬂuorescence buffer contain - ing 10 mM imidazole - HCl ( pH 7 . 8 ) , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl2 , 100 mM DTT , 3 mg / ml glucose , 20 mg / ml catalase , 100 mg / ml glucose oxidase , and 0 . 5 % methylcellulose to induce polymerization and were imaged at 20 s intervals on an objective - based TIRF microscope ( Nikon TE2000E ) . Metamorph soft - ware ( version . 6 . 3r7 ; Universal Imaging , Media , PA ) was used for image acqui - sition and analysis . Barbed - end elongation rates were 7 . 6 m M (cid:4) 1 s (cid:4) 1 for Mg - ATP / ADP + P i - actin with proﬁlin and 2 m M (cid:4) 1 s (cid:4) 1 for Mg - ADP - actin .
