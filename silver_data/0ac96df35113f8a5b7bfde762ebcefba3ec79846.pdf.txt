Oliveira ∗ Departamento de F´ısica , Universidade Federal do Cear´a , 60451 - 970 Fortaleza , Cear´a , Brazil Rheological responses are the most relevant features to describe soft matter . So far , such con - stitutive relations are still not well understood in terms of small scale properties , although this knowledge would help the design of synthetic and bio - materials . Here , we investigate , computa - tional and analytically , how mesoscopic - scale interactions inﬂuence the macroscopic behavior of viscoelastic materials . We design a coarse - grained approach where the local elastic and viscous con - tributions can be controlled . Applying molecular dynamics simulations , we mimic real indentation assays . When elastic forces are dominant , our model reproduces the hertzian behavior . However , when friction increases , it restores the Standard Linear Solid model . We show how the response parameters depend on the microscopic elastic and viscous contributions . Moreover , our ﬁndings also suggest that the relaxation times , obtained in relaxation and oscillatory experiments , obey a universal behavior in viscoelastic materials . One big challenge in science and engineering is the so - called multiscale modeling , namely , how constitutive re - lations of a material depend on its smaller scale interac - tion and composition [ 1 , 2 ] . Such emergence problem , as described by P . W . Anderson [ 3 ] , is even more remark - able in soft matter , where mesoscopic structures combine the atomistic and macroscopic frameworks and are re - sponsible to the material elasticity and viscosity [ 4 , 5 ] . In fact , the link among features of diﬀerent scales form - ing the matter is highly nontrivial and subjected to in - tense research [ 6 ] . The seminal work of H . Hertz about mechanical contacts , for instance , is still used nowadays to measure elastic properties of materials by analyzing how samples are deformed under applied stresses [ 7 ] . Al - though it is one of the most used models to investigate the stiﬀness of a material , it fails to relate the macro - scopic behavior with its inner parts . Besides , well - known analytical approaches such as the Maxwell , Kelvin - Voigt , and Standard Linear Solid models apply circuit analogies to propose a simple manner of how elastic and viscous terms mix up in viscoelastic materials [ 8 ] . Again , these rheological models neglect any downscaling analysis . Currently , many sophisticated methods have been de - veloped to study the viscoelasticity of materials . Nanoin - dentation experiments , for instance , such as those with Atomic Force Microscopy , are extensively applied to in - vestigate the mechanical properties at micrometer scale . Besides condensed matter , such technique has also been used to investigate soft materials [ 9 – 11 ] . The way the sample responses to external stresses depends on its elas - tic and viscous terms . However , the complex structure and composition in soft matter systems make it chal - lenging to investigate accurately the distribution of ap - plied stresses through their interior . Many soft matter systems hold large colloidal aggregations or long ( lin - ear or cross - linked ) polymeric chains , which have an es - sential mechanical role [ 4 ] . In living cells , for instance , the cytoskeleton and the cytoplasmic ﬂuid are constantly exchanging momentum with the extracellular surround - ings [ 12 , 13 ] . The knowledge of why these organelles inﬂuence the cell stiﬀness diﬀerently in healthy and sick cells , may lead to treatments for several diseases [ 14 ] . To investigate the link between mesoscopic and macro - scopic features , we employ a molecular coarse - grained approach to reproduce rheological behavior of soft mat - ter . We design a viscoelastic material composed of a particle - spring network immersed in a viscous medium so that the contribution of elastic and viscous interac - tions can be controlled at the mesoscopic level . This immersed network model is compatible with suspended polymer chains , colloidal aggregations , and other load - bearing structures as commonly found in soft materi - als [ 4 ] . Although real materials unlikely present purely quadratic potentials , for small deviations , molecular in - teractions displaying a potential well can be described appropriately by a spring - like interaction . For instance , the equivalent spring constant of the Lennard - Jones in - teratomic potential can be calculated as 72 (cid:15) 0 / (cid:96) 20 , where (cid:15) 0 is the height of the potential well and (cid:96) 0 the equi - librium distance between molecules [ 15 ] . Moreover , the computational model we develop here is easily changed to support a more realistic potential in order to study more complex materials . We also consider the spring network as a regular lattice . Although complex structures may inﬂuence rheological properties of a material , simple ge - ometries have been successfully applied to a large number of problems in mesoscopic models of condensed [ 16 , 17 ] and soft materials [ 18 – 20 ] . Our computational model consists of N spherical parti - cles of diameter σ and mass m arranged in a face - centered cubic ( FCC ) lattice with a height given by H and a bot - tom and top plane given by 20 σ × 20 σsin ( π / 3 ) . Ev - ery particle interacts with its 12 nearest neighbors by a spring potential . This elastic network is immersed in a medium of viscosity µ . Viscous eﬀects are taken into ac - count by considering friction between the particles and the medium . The network is indented by a hard sphere of diameter σ s , as shown in Fig . 1 . This spherical indenter moves down with constant speed until a maximum inden - tation depth , δ 0 , is achieved . To avoid non - linearities , we a r X i v : 2 004 . 02271v1 [ c ond - m a t . s o f t ] 5 A p r 2020 2 consider δ 0 = σ , i . e . , the maximum indentation is equal to the thickness of one layer of particles . Once in con - tact , the indenter applies a stress onto the particles . The bottom layer of the network is in contact to a hard sub - strate , where particles cannot move down but are free to slide horizontally . The equation of motion of the i th particle is given by the following Langevin - like equation [ 21 , 22 ] md 2 (cid:126)r i dt 2 = − γ(cid:126)v i − ∇ U i , ( 1 ) where (cid:126)r i and (cid:126)v i are the position and velocity vectors of particle i , respectively . The term γ(cid:126)v i , known as Stoke’s law , describes the drag force acting on spherical bodies , where the coeﬃcient of friction is given by γ = 3 πσµ [ 23 ] . The potential U i of particle i due to the neighboring par - ticles and the indenter is given by U i = (cid:88) j k ij ( r ij − (cid:96) ) 2 2 + (cid:15) (cid:18) σ r is − ( σ s − σ ) / 2 (cid:19) α , ( 2 ) where r ij = | (cid:126)r i − (cid:126)r j | is the distance and (cid:96) the equilibrium distance between the centers of neighboring particles i and j . k ij is the spring constant of the bond between these two particles . The last term of Eq . 2 applies only to surface particles , when they are in contact with the in - denter . r is = | (cid:126)r i − (cid:126)r s | is the distance between the center of particle i and the center of the indenter , (cid:15) is a constant of energy , and α regulates the hardness of the inden - ter . The particles and the indenter exclusively interact through this hard - sphere potential with a high value of α . See in Ref . [ 24 ] the constants used in this work . We solve the equations of motion in ( 1 ) through molec - ular dynamics simulations with a time integration done with the Velocity Verlet algorithm , and periodic bound - ary conditions applied to the horizontal plane [ 25 , 26 ] . The contact force F is the sum of all collisions on the indenter , computed at each time as the indenter slowly presses down the sample . F increases with the indenta - tion depth , δ , since more collisions occur on the indenter . These collisions cause a ﬂuctuation in F , but an equilib - rium state is reached in around 10 5 time steps . After equilibrium , we perform an additional 2 × 10 5 time steps to average the quantities of interest . Before viscoelastic materials , we explore the elasticity in networks without local friction ( γ = 0 ) . Initially , we study homogenous networks , where all bonds have the same spring constant , k ij = k , and later we investigate the role of heterogeneities of local elasticity in the global stiﬀness . For simplicity , we consider heterogeneous net - works made of only two types of bonds with spring con - stants given by k 1 and k 2 , respectively . Moreover , this binary network is built in two fashions depending on the distribution of k 1 and k 2 , namely , the double - layered and the binary random network . In the ﬁrst , two homoge - nous networks , with spring constants given by k 1 and k 2 , H σ s FIG . 1 : Particle - spring network arranged in an FCC ( face - centered cubic ) lattice with height H and immersed in a vis - cous medium ( not shown in the ﬁgure ) . Particles are bonded to their 12 nearest neighbors . A spherical indenter of diame - ter σ s is used to press down the top surface of the network . respectively , are deposited one on the top of the other ( see the inset in Fig . 2 ( a ) ) . In the second , k ij is ran - domly assigned to k 1 or k 2 according to probabilities φ 1 and φ 2 , respectively ( see the inset in Fig . 2 ( b ) ) . In both cases , φ 1 and φ 2 also stand to the fraction of each bond and φ 1 + φ 2 = 1 . For the limit cases of φ 1 = 0 and φ 1 = 1 , both the double - layered and the binary random networks become homogeneous with spring constant k 2 and k 1 , respectively . The distribution of stress into an elastic sample , due to an indentation δ , can be tricky [ 27 ] , however the force experienced by a spherical indenter is well described by the Hertz model F H = 8 √ 2 9 E √ σ s δ 3 / 2 , ( 3 ) where E is the eﬀective elastic modulus of the mate - rial [ 28 ] ( see Fig . S1 in the Supplementary Material ) . The contact forces computed in elastic networks perfectly agree with the Hertz model , where E can be obtained by ﬁtting the data with Eq . 3 . The results for homogeneous elastic networks are shown in Fig . S2 in the Supplemen - tary Material for diﬀerent values of k . As expected for this simple network , the eﬀective modulus of elasticity scales linearly with k . In addition , E is proportional to the sample height in the form E ∝ H − ζ , where ζ depends on the indenter geometry . Spherical and ﬂat indenters , for instance , give ζ = 1 / 3 and 1 , respectively . In fact , in the latter case , E represents the Young’s modulus of the material and can be found analytically with springs in series , while in the other case , E seems to take into account , besides Young’s modulus , the shear modulus of the material . The eﬀective elastic modulus as a function of φ 1 is shown in Fig . 2 ( a ) , for double - layered networks , and in 3 Fig . 2 ( b ) , for binary random networks , for k 2 = 500 and diﬀerent values of k 1 . E decreases with φ 1 for k 1 < k 2 , but increases with φ 1 for k 1 > k 2 , regardless the distri - bution of k 1 and k 2 . In double - layered networks , E is ﬁtted by the cubic function E = 570 . 75 + aφ + bφ 2 + cφ 3 , shown in colored solid lines . On the other hand , when k 1 and k 2 are randomly distributed over the network , E changes according to the straight line E = 570 . 75 + dφ , shown in colored solid lines . The constants a , b , c , and d depend on k 1 . Interestingly , the random distribution of local stiﬀness vanishes those polynomial higher order found in ( a ) . In order to study the contribution of viscous eﬀects ( γ > 0 ) in the macroscopic rheological behavior , we per - form relaxation and oscillatory assays in homogenous vis - coelastic networks . In relaxation experiments , the in - denter is initially located above the network and moving down into the top surface . Before touching the sample , the force is zero . When the indenter touches the surface particles , at time t 1 = 0 , the force rises until the maxi - mum indentation depth , δ 0 , is achieved , at t 3 . Figure 3 shows the time evolution of the normalized contact force , f , for k = 500 and several values of γ . The loading time , τ l = t 3 − t 1 , is the time the indenter pushes the sample . After reaching δ 0 , the indenter stops moving , but the sample particles may continue to move subjected to fric - tion ( the dwell stage ) . For elastic γ = 0 , the particles im - mediately rearrange themself to an equilibrium state and thus the force becomes nearly constant , except for some noise due to the perpetual undamped movement of the particles . On the other hand , in viscoelastic networks , this noise quickly vanishes while the force decreases con - tinuously to the value of the undamped case , at t 4 , since particles need time to relax into the equilibrium state . For long times , networks with the same elastic proper - ties experience the same contact force , regardless of the viscous contribution . Our numerical results are compatible with the Stan - dard Linear Solid ( SLS ) model composed of a Maxwell material ( i . e . , a spring of elastic modulus E 0 in series with a dashpot of viscosity η ) in parallel to another spring of elastic modulus E ∞ , see Fig . 3 . Such analyti - cal model successfully describes rheological behaviors of a large number of soft materials , such as polymers [ 29 ] , soft gels [ 30 ] , and living cells [ 31 , 32 ] . The relaxation function of this model is know as R ( t ) = E ∞ + E 0 e − t / τ , where the relaxation time is given by τ = η / E 0 . Ini - tially , the eﬀective modulus of elasticity is given by the sum of E ∞ and E 0 , but , for long times , the inﬂuence of E 0 vanishes , leaving E ∞ to dominate the elasticity of the material , regardless of the relaxation time . Notice that , E ∞ corresponds to the elastic modulus computed in elastic networks . The analytical force curves in the SLS model with a spherical indenter , f ( t ) , can be ob - tained separately in the loading , f l ( t ) , and dwell stages , 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 φ 1 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 E ( x10 3 ) k 1 = 1000 k 1 = 800 k 1 = 600 k 1 = 400 k 1 = 200 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 φ 1 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 E ( x10 3 ) k 1 = 1000 k 1 = 800 k 1 = 600 k 1 = 400 k 1 = 200 k 1 k 2 ( a ) ( b ) FIG . 2 : The eﬀective modulus of elasticity , E , as a function of the fraction of k 1 - bonds in heterogeneous elastic networks , φ 1 , for k 2 = 500 and several values of k 1 .

See more details in Section I of the Supplementary Ma - terial . Combining our numerical results with Eqs . 4 allows us to ﬁnd the relations between macroscopic ( τ and E 0 ) 4 0 50 100 150 200 t 0 150 300 450 600 f γ = 0 γ = 50 γ = 100 Eqs . ( 4 ) t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 E 0 η E ∞ FIG . 3 : Relaxation experiments in viscoelastic networks , for k = 500 and diﬀerent values of γ . The contact force increases in the loading stage and decreases in the dwell stage . The force is normalized by geometric constants ( see Eq . 4 in the Supplementary Material ) . Our numerical results are com - patible with the Standard Linear Solid ( SLS ) model given in Eqs . 4 . A schematic illustration of the SLS model is shown in the inset , with a dashpot of viscosity η and two springs of elastic moduli E 0 and E ∞ . and microscopic parameters ( k and γ ) in viscoelastic net - works . As shown for elastic networks , E ∞ increases lin - early with k and does not depend on γ . However , τ decreases with k and increases with γ ( see Fig . 4 ( a ) ) . On the other hand , E 0 increases with k but decreases with the local dissipation ( see Fig . 4 ( b ) ) . In oscillatory experiments , instead of stoping the in - denter after the maximum indentation is achieved , a si - nusoidal strain is imposed with the indentation depth following the function , δ ( t ) = δ 0 + δ a sin ( ωt ) , where δ a ( δ a = σ ) is the amplitude and ω the angular frequency of oscillation . The response force F also presents a pe - riodic behavior but with a time delay that depends on viscoelastic properties , F = F 0 + F a sin ( ωt + λ ) , where F 0 is the force at δ 0 , F a is the amplitude of the force and λ is the phase lag between force and indentation . Fig - ure S3 ( a ) and ( b ) , in the Supplementary Material , show δ ( t ) and F ( t ) , respectively , for a sample with k = 500 and three values of γ . The phase lag vanishes for γ = 0 , as it is expected for elastic materials , but increases with γ , for viscoelastic materials . The tangent of λ , deﬁned as the ratio between the loss modulus , G (cid:48) = δ a F a sin ( λ ) , and the storage modulus , G (cid:48)(cid:48) = δ a F a cos ( λ ) , represents a quantitative way to deﬁne the ﬂuidity of viscoelastic materials , i . e . , tan ( λ ) < 1 leads to solid - like materials while tan ( λ ) > 1 to ﬂuid - like mate - rials . High values of ω favor the ﬂuidity of the material , as shown in panel of Fig . 5 for several values of γ . Fig - ure S3 ( c ) and ( d ) , in the Supplementary Material , shows color maps of tan ( λ ) for more values of k and γ .

Fluid - like behavior should be observed for very high values of ω , which requires a time step too small compared to the time of the experiment . Moreover , viscoelastic materials may present diﬀerent re - laxation times regarding of how the sample is deformed . In this work , we obtained τ and τ o in relaxation and os - cillatory conditions , respectively . Standard Linear Solids under oscillatory strain leads to the following behavior [ 8 ] tan ( λ ) = A ωτ o 1 + ω 2 τ 2 o , ( 5 ) which is used to ﬁt those numerical data in Fig . 5 in order to obtain τ o , where A is a constant of the material . The main graph in Fig . 5 shows that τ and τ o depend on each other by the following exponential relation , τ = 0 . 466 ( e 0 . 08 τ o − 1 ) . Each point in the graph of Fig . 5 ( b ) represents a diﬀerent material , with diﬀerent k and γ , but they all collapse on that relation , suggesting some kind of universal behavior . In conclusion , we studied macroscopic rheological be - haviors in viscoelastic soft materials in terms of their microscopic elastic and viscous constituents . Diﬀerent indentation experiments were performed to investigated how the local stiﬀness and the coeﬃcient of friction in - 5 10 20 30 τ o 0 2 4 6 τ k = 400 k = 500 k = 600 10 20 30 40 50 ω ( x 10 - 3 ) 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 t a n ( λ ) γ = 10 γ = 20 γ = 30 γ = 40 Eq . ( 5 ) FIG . 5 : In oscillatory experiments , the tangent of the phase lag , λ , as a function of ω , is shown in the panel for k = 500 and diﬀerent values of γ . Our results recover in a good agreement the behavior of tan ( λ ) given in Eq . 5 , where the relaxation time in oscillatory experiments , τ o , is obtained . The relaxation times , τ and τ o , obtained in diﬀerent ex - periments of deformation , depend on each other as follows , τ = 0 . 466 ( e 0 . 08 τ o − 1 ) ( shown in black solid line ) , regardless of k and γ , as shown in the main graph . duce diﬀerent macroscopic behaviors . Elastic networks recovers the Hertz model for mechanical contact , where the eﬀective modulus of elasticity , E , is obtained . In homogeneous elastic networks , we found that E ∝ H − ζ , where H is the network height and the exponent depends on the indenter geometry . For spherical and ﬂat inden - ters , for instance , ζ = 1 / 3 and ζ = 1 , respectively . Het - erogeneous elastic networks , for simplicity , are assumed to be binary networks , where each bond holds one of only two possible values , k 1 or k 2 . When k 1 and k 2 are sepa - rated forming layers , E follows a cubic function with φ 1 , however , when k 1 and k 2 are randomly distributed , the higher order terms vanish and E changes linearly with φ 1 . Viscoelastic networks are compatible with the analytical Standard Linear Solid ( SLS ) model , which is described by two elastic moduli , E 0 and E ∞ , and a relaxation time , τ . Therefore , our work applies to all those materials that can be described by the Hertz and SLS models , such as polymers , gels and living cells . In oscillatory experi - ments , we also computed the phase lag between force and indentation , λ , and the relaxation time , τ o . We showed how all these macroscopic properties ( E 0 , E ∞ , τ , λ , and τ o ) depend on the microscopic parameters . In addition , the interplay between diﬀerent relaxation times , τ and τ 0 , obtained in relaxation and oscillatory experiments , follows an exponential behavior , regardless of the meso - scopic interactions . All viscoelastic networks simulated here collapsed on this curve , suggesting a universal be - havior in viscoelastic materials .
