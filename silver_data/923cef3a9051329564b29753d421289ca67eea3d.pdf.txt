Cunningham , Joshua Z . Rappoport * and John K . Heath ABSTRACT Growth factor signalling regulates multiple cellular functions and its misregulation has been linked to the development and progression of cancer . Ack1 ( activated Cdc42 - associated kinase 1 , also known as TNK2 ) is a non - receptor tyrosine kinase that has been implicated in trafficking and degradation of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , yet its precise functions remain elusive . In this report , we investigate the role of Ack1 in EGFR trafficking and show that Ack1 partially colocalises to Atg16L - positive structures upon stimulation with EGF . These structures are proposed to be the isolation membranes that arise during formation of autophagosomes . In addition , we find that Ack1 colocalises and interacts with sequestosome 1 ( p62 / SQSTM1 ) , a receptor for selective autophagy , through a ubiquitin - associated domain , and this interaction decreases upon treatment with EGF , thus suggesting that Ack1 moves away from p62 / SQSTM1 compartments . Furthermore , Ack1 interacts and colocalises with NBR1 , another autophagic receptor , and this colocalisation is enhanced in the presence of ectopically expressed p62 / SQSTM1 . Finally , knockdown of Ack1 results in accelerated localisation of EGFR to lysosomes upon treatment with EGF . Structure – function analyses of a panel of Ack1 deletion mutants revealed key mechanistic aspects of these relationships . The Mig6 - homology domain and clathrin - binding domain both contribute to colocalisation with EGFR , whereas the UBA domain is essential for colocalisation with p62 / SQSTM1 , but not NBR1 . Taken together , our studies demonstrate a novel role for Ack1 in diverting activated EGFR into a non - canonical degradative pathway , marked by association with p62 / SQSTM1 , NBR1 and Atg16L . KEY WORDS : Ack1 / TNK2 , EGFR , p62 / SQSTM1 , NBR1 , Autophagy INTRODUCTION Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is a member of the ErbB family of cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) ( Citri and Yarden , 2006 ) . Ligand binding results in EGFR dimerisation , transphosphorylation and ubiquitylation , leading to activation of several downstream signalling cascades ( Levkowitz et al . , 1998 ; Citri and Yarden , 2006 ; Schneider and Wolf , 2009 ) . Following activation , EGFR undergoes regulated endocytosis from the cell surface ( Rappoport and Simon , 2009 ; Goh et al . , 2010 ) . Internalised EGFR is targeted to early endosomes , where it is sorted through the recycling compartment back to the plasma membrane , or into lysosomes for degradation ( Madshus and Stang , 2009 ) . Furthermore , endocytosis of EGFR , its incorporation into multivesicular bodies of late endosomes and its lysosomal degradation are essential for signal attenuation , and uncontrolled EGFR signalling has been found in different types of cancer ( Burke et al . , 2001 ; Di Fiore and De Camilli , 2001 ; Seto et al . , 2002 ) . Thus , the mechanisms that regulate EGFR trafficking are significant . Ack1 ( activated Cdc42 - associated kinase 1 or TNK2 ) is a non - receptor tyrosine kinase that has been proposed to regulate EGFR trafficking ( Grøvdal et al . , 2008 ) , yet the precise mechanistic roles of Ack1 in this context remain elusive . High levels of Ack1 expression result in the inhibition of EGFR degradation ( Grøvdal et al . , 2008 ) , possibly because of the disruption of endocytic machinery as a consequence of clathrin sequestration ( Teo et al . , 2001 ) . Additionally , downregulation of Ack1 has also been shown to inhibit EGFR degradation and increase recycling , and Ack1 has been proposed to regulate endosomal sorting of EGFR into the inner vesicles of multivesicular bodies ( Grøvdal et al . , 2008 ) . Interestingly , increased Cdc42 - dependent Ack1 phosphorylation has been observed in cells depleted of dynamin , and in these cells , Ack1 showed enhanced binding of both endocytic and ubiquitylated proteins ( Shen et al . , 2011 ) . Apart from ‘classical’ lysosomal degradation , other non - canonical degradative pathways exist in which misfolded proteins , protein aggregates , damaged organelles and bacteria are ubiquitylated and degraded ( Kraft et al . , 2010 ) . Selective autophagy , which eliminates ubiquitylated protein aggregates and organelles , is one of the major degradative pathways within the cell . Formation of protein aggregates has been suggested to be mediated by autophagy receptors , which recognise ubiquitylated cargo : these include sequestosome 1 ( p62 / SQSTM1 ) and neighbour of BRCA1 ( NBR1 ) ( Kraft et al . , 2010 ) . Although autophagy takes place at the basal levels within the cell , there are various stimuli that have been shown to induce autophagy , in particular withdrawal of growth factors ( Wang and Levine , 2010 ; Mizushima et al . , 2011 ) , for example , deprivation of EGF in mammary epithelial cells ( Fung et al . , 2008 ) . Recently , we reported that NBR1 functions in degradation of RTK ( Mardakheh et al . , 2009 ; Mardakheh et al . , 2010 ) . Specifically we showed that association of NBR1 with Spred2 , a signalling inhibitor , promotes RTK degradation , whereas NBR1 on its own inhibits degradation . In the present study we investigate the precise roles of Ack1 in EGFR trafficking . We find that Ack1 interacts and colocalises with p62 / SQSTM1 ( Lamark et al . , 2009 ) , and this interaction decreases upon EGF stimulation .

Conversely , EGF stimulation results in localisation of Ack1 to Atg16 - positive structures , which are likely to be pre - autophagosomal isolation membranes ( Matsushita et al . , 2007 ; Mizushima et al . , 2011 ) . Furthermore , silencing of Ack1 leads to enhanced EGFR lysosomal localisation . Thus , our results define a novel role for Ack1 in targeting activated EGFR into a non - canonical degradative pathway through its association with autophagic receptors p62 / SQSTM1 and NBR1 , which influences the kinetics of EGFR trafficking . RESULTS Ack1 interacts and colocalises with EGFR , but not with FGFR A role for Ack1 in EGFR trafficking has been proposed ( Shen et al . , 2007 ; Grøvdal et al . , 2008 ) , yet the precise functions remain elusive . Consistent with previous reports ( Shen et al . , 2007 ) , we show that EGFR co - precipitates with Ack1 following EGF stimulation ( Fig . 1A ) . Constitutively active Cdc42 ( caCdc42 ) , a known Ack1 interactor ( Manser et al . , 1993 ) , also co - precipitates with Ack1 ( Fig . 1A ) . In contrast , FGFR1 and FGFR2 do not co - precipitate with Ack1 following treatment with FGF ( Fig . 1A and supplementary material Fig . S1B ) . Similarly , Ack1 colocalises with EGFR in EGF - treated cells ( Fig . 1B ) , as represented by the high Pearson’s correlation coefficient ( PCC ) , which decreases upon deliberate misalignment by pixel move - ment ( see the Materials and Methods ) . In the case of FGFR2 , the PCC is low and remains low irrespective of pixel movement , indicating a lack of colocalisation between Ack1 and FGFR2 ( Fig . 1B ) . These results emphasise the differences between EGFR and FGFR trafficking , despite activation of similar downstream signalling pathways . Additionally , truncated Ack1 ( tAck1 ) , which lacks the C - terminal portion ( supplementary material Fig . S1B ) , does not colocalise with EGFR after EGF treatment ( supplementary material Fig . S1C ) , indicating that the C - terminal fragment is essential for the Ack1 – EGFR association . This is consistent with the studies showing that the Mig6 homology domain within the C - terminus of Ack1 mediates this association ( Shen et al . , 2007 ) . In order to study the physiological relevance of this association , we took advantage of the human prostatic adenocarcinoma cell line LNCaP , which has previously been used to study endogenous Ack1 ( Mahajan et al . , 2005 ; Liu et al . , 2010 ) . As shown in Fig . 1C , colocalisation between endogenous Ack1 and EGFR could be detected in LNCaP cells . To our knowledge this is the first successful report of colocalisation between endogenous Ack1 and EGFR . Therefore , under physiological conditions , Ack1 and EGFR show EGF - dependent colocalisation . The Mig6 - homology domain and clathrin - binding domain of Ack1 both contribute to the colocalisation with EGFR upon EGF stimulation It has been proposed that the UBA domain of Ack1 is required for EGFR degradation , whereas the Mig6 domain mediates the interaction with EGFR ( Shen et al . , 2007 ) . To analyse more precisely which of the Ack1 domains are required for the association with EGFR , we generated a series of C - terminal truncations of Ack1 ( Fig . 2A ) . These include a mutant with deletion of the C - terminal ubiquitin - associated ( UBA ) domain ( D UBA ) , a mutant with deletion of both UBA and Mig6 homology ( Mig6 ) domain ( D Mig6 ) , and a mutant with deletion of UBA , Mig6 and the region particularly rich in proline residues , which we designated a proline - rich domain ( D PRD ) . Each of these mutants was tagged with mCherry at the N - terminus . In the study we also took advantage of truncated Ack1 , which lacks the C - terminal portion [ including UBA , Mig6 , PRD and clathrin binding domain ( CBD ) ] . Using these constructs , we carried out a series of colocalisation studies with EGFR – GFP upon EGF stimulation . As shown in Fig . 2B , deletion of the UBA domain alone did not alter colocalisation between Ack1 and EGFR , which is similar to the full - length protein ( , 90 % ) . In contrast , deletion of both UBA and Mig6 domains dramatically decreased this colocalisation ( , 43 % ) . This is consistent with previous reports on the role of the Mig6 domain in the association between Ack1 and EGFR ( Shen et al . , 2007 ) . Additional removal of the PRD does not have any further effect on the colocalisation with EGFR . However , the absence of the CBD , which is represented by tAck1 , abolishes any remaining colocalisation ( Fig . 2B ) . These data emphasise the importance of the Mig6 domain in this context and suggest that the association of Ack1 with clathrin also contributes to this colocalisation . Importantly , the UBA domain alone has no influence on the colocalisation of Ack1 and EGFR , suggesting that EGFR ubiquitylation is not required for colocalisation with Ack1 . Ack1 partially localises to early endosomes upon EGF stimulation We further analysed the subcellular localisation of Ack1 in the context of EGF signalling , because a precise localisation remains elusive , especially in pre - EGF conditions . Immunostaining of HeLa cells with anti - EEA1 ( early endosome antigen 1 ) antibody reveals that in unstimulated cells ( 0 minutes EGF ) mCherry – Ack1 poorly colocalised with EEA1 , as manifested by a very low PCC ( Fig . 3A ) . In contrast , at 15 minutes , and more noticeably at 30 minutes following EGF stimulation , Ack1 colocalisation with EEA1 significantly increased . These results are consistent with previous reports showing that Ack1 partially colocalises with EGFR on early endosomes ( Shen et al . , 2007 ; Grøvdal et al . , 2008 ) . However , recently , early endosomes have also been shown to be essential for autophagosome maturation ( Razi et al . , 2009 ; Tooze and Razi , 2009 ) . Therefore , we also investigated whether Ack1 colocalises with ectopically expressed Rab5 , which is a small GTPase that localises mostly to early endosomes , but has also been found on autophagosomes and other structures ( Stenmark , 2009 ) . Similar to EEA1 , in unstimulated cells colocalisation of Ack1 with Rab5 was low , represented by a very low PCC ( supplementary material Fig . S2A ) ; however , as with EEA1 , there was an increase in colocalisation of Ack1 and Rab5 following EGF treatment ( supplementary material Fig . S2A ) . Taken together , these results indicate that following EGF stimulation , Ack1 traffics through EEA1 - and Rab5 - positive compartments . However , these data also raise the potential connection between Ack1 and non - canonical degradative pathways . Ack1 localises to pre - autophagosomal structures upon EGF stimulation Apart from the classical endo / lysosomal pathway , other non - canonical degradation pathways exist . We and others show that Ack1 partially localises to EEA1 - positive compartments upon treatment with EGF ( Shen et al . , 2007 ; Grøvdal et al . , 2008 ) . Because early endosomes are required for autophagosomal maturation ( Razi et al . , 2009 ; Tooze and Razi , 2009 ) , we investigated whether Ack is involved in the autophagosomal pathway . Atg ( autophagy - related ) proteins , which are essential for autophagy , are required for the initiation and maturation of autophagosomes ( Mizushima et al . , 2011 ) . At the initial stages of autophagosome formation , when the isolation membrane is not yet enclosed , a multimeric complex of Atg16L , Atg5 and Atg12 RESEARCH ARTICLE Journal of Cell Science ( 2014 ) 127 , 994 – 1006 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 136895 995 J o u r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e assembles , which dissociates upon membrane closure ( Mizushima et al . , 2011 ) . We therefore examined whether Ack1 colocalises with Atg16L before or during EGF stimulation . As shown in Fig . 3B , in unstimulated cells Atg16L staining was diffuse ; however , upon EGF stimulation , punctate Atg16 - positive structures could be distinguished and Ack1 localised to these structures . The colocalisation of Ack1 and Atg16L was quantified ( Fig . 3B ) ; , 25 % of Ack1 puncta were positive for Atg16L after 15 minutes of EGF treatment . This was significantly higher than random control regions not containing Ack1 ( see the Materials and Methods ) ( Fig . 3B ) . Additionally , colocalisation of Ack1 and Atg16L was quantified with PCC , where an increase in colocalisation was observed 15 and 30 minutes after EGF treatment ( Fig . 3B , bottom graph ) . Furthermore , endogenous Ack1 also colocalised with endogenous Atg16 ( supplementary material Fig . S2B ) . Finally , immunoprecipitation of endogenous Atg16L resulted in co - precipitation of endogenous Ack1 Fig . 1 . Ack1 interacts with EGFR , but not with FGFR .

Thus , these data show that Ack1 associates with Atg16L - positive structures , in particular upon EGF stimulation . Although growth factor signalling has been shown to inhibit autophagy ( Wang and Levine , 2010 ; Mizushima et al . , 2011 ) , reports exist indicating a role for clathrin - mediated endocytosis in autophagosome formation ( Ravikumar et al . , 2010 ; Mari et al . , 2011 ) . Stimulation with EGF promotes clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Sorkin and Goh , 2009 ) and might therefore provide membranes for autophagosome formation . Ack1 localises within ubiquitin - rich compartments Given that Ack1 is potentially involved in the autophagosomal pathway , which involves degradation of ubiquitylated cargo , and that Ack1 has previously been shown to bind both mono - and poly - ubiquitin , as well as ubiquitylated proteins ( Shen et al . , 2007 ) , we analysed whether Ack1 colocalises with ubiquitin . Thus , we expressed GFP – Ack1 and HA – ubiquitin in HeLa cells . As shown in Fig . 4A , there was a strong colocalisation of Ack1 and ubiquitin . Importantly , we observed large ubiquitin - rich structures to which Ack1 localised , herein referred to as ‘ubiquitin - rich compartments’ ( supplementary material Fig . S3A ) . As a negative control , we used truncated Ack1 , which lacks the C - terminal portion , including the UBA domain ( supplementary material Fig . S1B ) . We found that truncated Ack1 does not colocalise with ubiquitin ( Fig . 4A ) . Consistently , Fig . 2 . Mig6 and CBD of Ack1 regulate colocalisation with EGFR after EGF stimulation .

Because the band detected by the antibody against GFP corresponds to the one detected by the HA antibody ( Fig . 4B ) , and Ack1 has been shown to be ubiquitylated by Nedd4 ubiquitin ligases ( Chan et al . , 2009 ; Lin et al . , 2010 ) , we propose that this is ubiquitylated Ack1 . Altogether , these results indicate that Ack1 is localised within ubiquitin - rich compartments and that the C - terminal portion of Ack1 is important for this localisation . Next , we investigated whether EGFR colocalises with Ack1 within ubiquitin - rich compartments . As shown in Fig . 4C , upon EGF stimulation more than 90 % of Ack1 puncta colocalised with EGFR , and nearly 70 % of those were positive for ubiquitin . These results indicate that Ack1 and EGFR are localised within ubiquitin - rich compartments following EGF stimulation . Collectively , these data emphasise that Ack1 is involved in ubiquitin - dependent degradation of EGFR . We further analysed which of the Ack1 domains regulate the colocalisation of Ack1 and ubiquitin . We found that high Fig . 3 .

S3B ) . We observed a further decrease in colocalisation following deletion of the PRD ( 20 – 30 % ) . Finally , the colocalisation was nearly abolished in the case of tAck1 . Importantly , the association with ubiquitin seemed to be independent of EGF treatment , and there was no difference in colocalisation before and after EGF stimulation ( supplementary material Fig . S3B ) . These data indicate that the UBA domain , the PRD and CBD all contribute to the association between Ack1 and ubiqutin and / or ubiquitylated proteins . Ack1 interacts and colocalises with p62 / SQSTM1 , an autophagy receptor , in unstimulated cells To further identify the ubiquitin - rich compartments where Ack1 is localised , we considered ubiquitin - rich protein aggregates , the formation of which is a common phenomenon in non - canonical degradative pathways ( Kraft et al . , 2010 ) . p62 / SQSTM1 and NBR1 are ubiquitin - binding proteins that have been proposed to act as cargo receptors in the process of autophagy ( Lamark et al . , 2009 ) . We showed previously that p62 and NBR1 associate with Spred2 , a signalling inhibitor , to promote degradation of RTKs , whereas NBR1 on its own inhibits RTKs degradation ( Mardakheh et al . , 2009 ; Mardakheh et al . , 2010 ) . Here we show that Ack1 highly colocalises with p62 / SQSTM1 in unstimulated cells ( Fig . 5A ) . This is represented by a high PCC , which gradually decreases upon pixel movement . Interestingly , this colocalisation decreases upon EGF treatment ( Fig . 5A ) , suggesting that EGF stimulation negatively influences the association between Ack1 and p62 / SQSTM1 . In addition to our colocalisation studies , we also show that endogenous p62 / SQSTM1 co - precipitates with endogenous Ack1 in unstimulated LNCaP cells , and this interaction decreases following EGF stimulation ( Fig . 5B ) . The interaction is also preserved in cells treated with bafilomycin A1 , which inhibits lysosomal acidification and hence degradation ( Fig . 5B ) . This data suggests that Ack1 and p62 / SQSTM1 may be interacting during fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes , a process sensitive to bafilomycin treatment ( Yamamoto et al . , 1998 ) . p62 / SQSTM1 promotes colocalisation of Ack1 and NBR1 We also examined the colocalisation of Ack1 and NBR1 , another autophagy receptor . Previously we reported that NBR1 mainly localises to the limiting membranes of the late endosomes ( Mardakheh et al . , 2009 ) . Here , we show that Ack1 interacted with NBR1 both in the presence and absence of ectopically Fig . 4 . EGFR colocalises with Ack1 within ubiquitin - rich compartments upon EGF treatment .

S4 ) . We also show that Ack1 colocalised with NBR1 , but the colocalisation is relatively low ( , 25 % ) and independent of EGF treatment ( Fig . 5C ) . However , in the presence of ectopically expressed p62 / SQSTM1 , the colocalisation of NBR1 and Ack1 dramatically increased to , 52 % in serum - starved cells ( Fig . 5D ) . Furthermore , this colocalisation sig - nificantly decreased after EGF treatment ( , 34 % ) . Importantly , there was a very strong colocalisation of NBR1 and p62 / SQSTM1 ( , 80 % ) ( Fig . 5D ) , suggesting that p62 / SQSTM1 plays an active role in compartment maturation , promotes colocalisation of Ack1 and NBR1 , and confers EGF sensitivity on this colocalisation . We also found that upon EGF stimulation , internalised EGFR partially colocalised with Ack1 and p62 / SQSTM1 ( , 20 % ) , as shown in Fig . 6 . This is consistent with our data showing that the colocalisation of Ack1 and p62 / SQSTM1 decreased after EGF treatment . Interestingly , endogenous EGFR also partially colocalised with endogenous p62 / SQSTM1 , and this was not affected by knockdown of Ack1 ( supplementary material Fig . S5A ) . Because we show that only a portion of EGFR present within the Ack1 puncta colocalised with p62 / SQSTM1 ( Fig . 6 ) , it is possible that any difference in colocalisation in Ack1 - knockdown cells is difficult to identify . Additionally , because knockdown of Ack1 was not complete ( supplementary material Fig . S5B ) , it is possible that the remaining Ack1 is sufficient to mediate the colocalisation of EGFR and p62 / SQSTM1 . Altogether , these results indicate that serum deprivation promotes the interac - tion between Ack1 and p62 / SQSTM1 , whereas EGF stimula - tion might result in translocation of Ack1 away from the p62 / SQSTM1 compartments . In summary , our data reveal a novel association between Ack1 and the autophagy receptors p62 / SQSTM1 and NBR1 . The C - terminal UBA domain regulates colocalisation of Ack1 and p62 / SQSTM1 We further analysed the function of several Ack1 domains with respect to colocalisation with p62 / SQSTM1 . As shown in Fig . 7 , in unstimulated cells Ack1 highly colocalised with p62 / SQSTM1 ( , 55 % ) and this colocalisation partially decreased upon EGF stimulation ( , 30 % ) . Thus , Ack1 colocalisation with p62 / SQSTM1 post - EGF treatment is preserved , although to a much lower extent . Deletion of the UBA domain dramatically decreased the colocalisation between Ack1 and p62 / SQSTM1 in unstimulated cells ( , 20 % ) and abolished EGF sensitivity . Importantly , deletion of the UBA domain did not have any effect on the colocalisation of Ack1 and NBR ( supplementary material Fig . S6 ) , indicating that the coloca - lisation of Ack1 and p62 / SQSTM1 is highly specific . Further deletion of the Mig6 or PRD domains did not lead to any dramatic change in the colocalisation of Ack1 and p62 / SQSTM1 . However , any remaining colocalisation was abrogated in the case of tAck1 . These data underscore the significance of the UBA domain in the association between Ack1 and p62 / SQSTM1 and reveal that the presence of the UBA domain crucially confers the EGF sensitivity on this colocalisation . Silencing of Ack1 results in increased transient lysosomal localisation of EGFR Because we identified an interaction between Ack1 and the autophagy receptors , we hypothesised that Ack1 prevents EGFR from trafficking through the canonical lysosomal pathway , and rather targets it into a non - canonical degradative pathway . Therefore , we investigated whether localisation of EGFR to lysosomes is affected in cells depleted of Ack1 . Thus , LNCaP cells expressing GFP - tagged EGFR were treated with siRNA against Ack1 or with non - targeting RNAi control . Following serum starvation and incubation with LysoTracker , a fluorescent dye that stains lysosomes ( Chazotte , 2011 ) , the cells were imaged for 30 minutes after EGF stimulation . As shown in Fig . 8A , when compared with the control ( supplementary material Movie 1 ) , knockdown of Ack1 promotes increased transient colocalisation of EGFR and LysoTracker following EGF stimulation ( supplementary material Movie 2 ) . Silencing of Ack1 was verified by western blotting and quantified by real - time quantitative polymerase chain reaction as , 80 % Fig . 6 . p62 / SQSTM1 partially colocalises with Ack1 and EGFR upon EGF stimulation . HeLa cells transfected with mCherry – Ack1 , EGFR – GFP and p62 – FLAG were serum starved and stimulated with EGF for 30 minutes , fixed and immunostained with anti - SQSTM1 antibody . For colocalisation as percentage , Ack1 puncta were circled and the colocalisation with EGFR and p62 / SQSTM1 , or between EGFR and p62 / SQSTM1 within the Ack1 puncta , was quantified .

This observation therefore indicates that the presence of Ack1 delays EGFR recruitment to lysosomes . Interestingly , EGFR degradation was not affected by knockdown of Ack1 ( supplementary material Fig .

Altogether , these data strongly support the proposed role of Ack1 in targeting EGFR into a non - canonical degradative pathway . Fig . 7 .

RESEARCH ARTICLE Journal of Cell Science ( 2014 ) 127 , 994 – 1006 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 136895 1003 J o u r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e DISCUSSION Ack1 has been identified to regulate EGFR trafficking and degradation ( Grøvdal et al . , 2008 ) , yet a precise function for Ack1 in this context has not been largely explored . Our work suggests a model for Ack1 function ( Fig . 8B ) , in which Ack1 is localised within p62 / SQSTM1 and ubiquitin - rich compartments in unstimulated cells ; however , upon EGF stimulation , Ack1 localises away from p62 / SQSTM1 to early endosomes to promote non - canonical trafficking of EGFR . Previous studies suggest that Ack1 partially localises to early endosomes before ( Prieto - Echagu¨e et al . , 2010 ) and after EGF treatment ( Shen et al . , 2007 ; Grøvdal et al . , 2008 ) . However , we showed that colocalisation of Ack1 with the early endosomal marker EEA1 significantly increases after EGF stimulation ( Fig . 3A ) ( Shen et al . , 2007 ; Grøvdal et al . , 2008 ) . Following EGF treatment , Ack1 similarly colocalises with Rab5 ( supplementary material Fig . S2A ) , which localises to early endosomes and other structures , including autophagosomes ( Stenmark , 2009 ) . It has been shown that the fusion of early endosomes with autophagosomes is required for autophagosome maturation ( Razi et al . , 2009 ) . Therefore , the colocalisation with EEA1 led us to assess an autophagosomal localisation for Ack1 . We found that following EGF stimulation , Ack1 partially colocalised with Atg16L ( Fig . 3B , C ) , a protein that is essential for early stages of autophagosome formation ( Matsushita et al . , 2007 ) . Thus , we propose that Ack1 localises to both early endosomes and autophagosomes upon stimulation with EGF . Ack1 partially colocalises with clathrin and a - adaptin in cells at steady state ( Teo et al . , 2001 ) . Furthermore , Ack1 has been detected by electron microscopy on large reticular membrane compartments upon EGF stimulation ( Grøvdal et al . , 2008 ) ; however , to our knowledge Ack1 localisation in serum - starved cells has not been reported . Therefore , we were interested in a precise subcellular localisation for Ack1 , in particular upon serum starvation . Previously , it has been shown that Ack1 binds ubiquitin and ubiquitylated proteins ( Shen et al . , 2007 ) and in cells depleted of dynamin , Ack1 exhibits increased phosphorylation and binding of ubiquitylated proteins ( Shen et al . , 2011 ) . Therefore , we examined the association between Ack1 and ectopically expressed ubiquitin , and found that Ack1 binds and colocalises with ubiquitin independent of EGF stimulation ( Fig . 4B , C and supplementary material Fig . S3B ) . Because ubiquitylation reg - ulates protein degradation ( Kraft et al . , 2010 ) , we considered subcellular compartments rich in ubiquitylated proteins that are targeted for degradation . p62 / SQSTM1 has been shown to act as an autophagy receptor and localise to ubiquitylated protein aggregates ( Kraft et al . , 2010 ) . Here , we show that Ack1 colocalises with p62 / SQSTM1 in unstimulated cells , and this colocalisation decreased following EGF stimulation ( Fig . 5A ) . This is verified by biochemical studies , where we observed an interaction between endogenous Ack1 and p62 / SQSTM1 , which also decreases after EGF treatment ( Fig . 5B ) . Therefore , we propose that in unstimulated cells Ack1 mainly localises to p62 / SQSTM1 - and ubiquitin - rich compartments . In addition to our studies on p62 / SQSTM1 , we also observed colocalisation of Ack1 and NBR1 , another autophagy receptor ( Lamark et al . , 2009 ) . In this case , however , the colocalisation was not as striking as with p62 / SQSTM1 ( , 25 % ) and was insensitive to EGF treatment ( Fig . 5C ) . This strongly emphasises the specificity of the association between Ack1 and p62 / SQSTM1 . Importantly , colocalisation of Ack1 and NBR1 dramatically increased in the presence of ectopically expressed p62 / SQSTM1 ( , 50 % ) ( Fig . 5D ) , indicating that p62 / SQSTM1 positively influences the colocalisation of Ack1 and NBR1 . Although HeLa cells express endogenous p62 / SQSTM1 ( Pankiv et al . , 2007 ) , it might not be sufficient to affect the localisation of ectopically expressed proteins . Previously , we reported that NBR1 is a late endosomal protein that partially localises to autophagosomes , and that its late endosomal and autophagosomal localisation are independent ( Mardakheh et al . , 2009 ; Mardakheh et al . , 2010 ) . We therefore propose that NBR1 and p62 / SQSTM1 , despite interacting ( Kraft et al . , 2010 ) , are present within different subcellular compartments as a result of other roles that they play within the cells . Because p62 / SQSTM1 and NBR1 interact with each other through their Phox and Bem 1 ( PB1 ) domains ( Johansen and Lamark , 2011 ) , we suggest that this leads to an indirect colocalisation of Ack1 and NBR1 in the presence of the ectopically expressed p62 / SQSTM1 . Our structure – function studies demonstrated that the UBA domain of Ack1 is essential for association with p62 / SQSTM1 ( Fig . 7 ) . Deletion of the UBA domain dramatically decreased this association and desensitised it to EGF treatment . This finding is particularly relevant considering that the UBA domain of several autophagic receptors , including p62 / SQSTM1 and NBR1 , is crucial for their function because it recognises ubiquitylated cargo , leading to its autophagic clearance ( Bjørkøy et al . , 2005 ; Johansen and Lamark , 2011 ) . We also show that knockdown of Ack1 resulted in accelerated trafficking of EGFR towards lysosomal compartments ( Fig . 8A ) . This therefore indicates that the presence of Ack1 prevents EGFR from rapid translocation to lysosomes following EGF stimulation and suggests that Ack1 plays a role in mediating EGFR trafficking into a non - canonical degradative pathway . In this context , it is surprising that deletion of the UBA domain of Ack1 has no effect on its association with EGFR , suggesting that ubiquitylation of EGFR is dispensable for this association . We therefore propose that the association of EGFR with the Mig6 and clathrin - binding domains of Ack1 , accompanied by Ack1 association with ubiquitin and p62 / SQSTM , act as an underlying mechanism to the non - canonical trafficking of EGFR . In summary , our studies identify a novel role for Ack1 in a non - canonical degradative pathway . We propose that Ack1 ‘shuttles’ between the p62 / SQSTM1 compartments and the canonical endocytic pathway , and prevents EGFR trafficking by the classical lysosomal pathway . MATERIALS AND METHODS Antibodies and reagents Anti - GFP ( D5 . 1 ) , anti - HA - tag ( C29F4 ) , anti - EEA1 and anti - EGFR polyclonal and monoclonal ( D38B1 ) antibodies were purchased from Fig . 8 . Silencing of Ack1 results in increased transient lysosomal localisation of EGFR . ( A ) LNCaP cells transfected with EGFR – GFP and siRNA for Ack1 or non - silencing RNAi control were serum starved and incubated with LysoTracker Red for 30 minutes . Live - cell imaging was performed after 30 minutes of EGF stimulation . PCC was measured for the area within a cell ( excluding the plasma membrane ) at indicated times of EGF stimulation . For normalisation , PCC in unstimulated cells ( 0 min EGF ) was set as 1 , and the changes in PCC upon EGF stimulation were calculated relative to the PCC value in unstimulated cells .

Ack1 is predominantly present within p62 / SQSTM1 - rich compartments in serum - starved cells . Upon EGF stimulation , a portion of Ack1 translocates from p62 / SQSTM1 - rich compartments to early endosomes and diverts EGFR trafficking into a non - canonical degradative pathway . When Ack1 is knocked down , EGFR traffics through a canonical lysosomal pathway .

For antibody crosslinking , Dynabeads conjugated with anti - Ack1 antibody were incubated with dimethyl pimelidate dihydrochloride ( Sigma ) in triethanolamine ( pH 8 . 2 ) ( Sigma ) following by a glycine wash ( pH 3 . 0 ) ( Fishers Scientific , Fair Lawn , NJ ) . Immunoblots were imaged using Odyssey Application Software version 3 . 0 with the Odyssey Imaging System ( Li - Cor ) . Immunostaining and cell imaging Cells were plated onto coverslips 24 – 48 hours before immunostaining . In the case of LNCaP cells , coverslips were additionally pre - coated with poly - D - lysine ( 0 . 01 mg / ml ) ( Sigma ) to enable cell attachment to coverslips .

For live - cell imaging , cells were plated onto a dish with a glass coverslip bottom ( MalTek , Ashland , MA ) in cell - imaging medium at 37 ˚ C . Images were acquired using a Nikon A1R confocal microscope with a 60 6 oil objective ( N . A . 1 . 49 ) and analysed with Nikon NIS Elements software . Image quantification For assessing colocalisation with the Pearson’s correlation coefficient ( PCC ) , a line was drawn around a cell , and the correlation between two channels ( e . g . green and red ) was measured as PCC . In the case of additional quantification with pixel shift , one channel ( e . g . green ) was shifted one pixel at time with reference to another channel ( e . g . red ) , up to ten pixels . The gradual decrease in PCC was considered as genuine colocalisation . For assessing colocalisation as a percentage , puncta were circled and those that colocalised with another channel were counted and expressed as a percentage . As a negative control , the circles were moved into adjacent areas negative for fluorescence in a given channel , and the random colocalisation with another channel was quantified .
