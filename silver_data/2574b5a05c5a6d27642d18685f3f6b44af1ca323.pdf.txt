S . ) , Black women in the perinatal period disproportionately experience higher rates of mental health chal - lenges like anxiety and postpartum depression . Digital platforms present promising opportunities for mental health support . How - ever , the extent to which these tools are being adopted and satis - fying the mental health needs amongst perinatal Black women is underexplored . To address this gap , we surveyed 101 pregnant and postpartum Black women in the U . S . Despite prior work showing low utilization of mental health services amongst Black women , our results show more than half of our participants using specifc digital tools for mental health support ( e . g . , mobile apps and social media ) . Importantly , use and satisfaction with these tools varied by subgroups ( e . g . , income and education level ) . We use our fndings to present recommendations for digital mental health interven - tion research that incorporates an understanding of intersectional identities during the perinatal period .

S , the rates of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders ( PMAD ) and serious mental illness ( SMI ) has nearly doubled in pregnant and postpartum women over the last decade [ 75 ] . Moreover , it is estimated that 10 to 15 % of perinatal women in the United States experience SMI and that between 70 - 80 % of postpartum women sufer from some level of psychological distress after pregnancy [ 50 , 84 ] . In our work , we defne the perinatal period as the time period from conception and birth ( i . e . , prenatal ) , through the frst year following the delivery of the baby ( i . e . , postpartum ) [ 1 ] . Throughout this period , mental illnesses can have devastating impacts on the psychological , emotional , and physical wellbeing of the mother and her child , such as preterm birth , maternal stress , and postpartum depression [ 9 , 26 , 53 , 68 , 102 ] . Despite these alarming rates , many new moms in the U . S . do not receive the necessary treatment or care due to factors such as stigma and lack of access [ 84 ] . There is a need for interventions that support the mental and emotional wellbeing of perinatal women and birthing people . The Human - computer interaction ( HCI ) and health informatics communities have begun to explore how digital health platforms can support the psychological wellbeing of pregnant and postpar - tum women . These investigations have ranged from the study of mobile applications that enable the sharing of maternal health edu - cational resources [ 57 , 59 ] , to telehealth services that provide an alternative to in - person therapy [ 6 , 52 ] , to work exploring social media as a venue for disclosing pregnancy loss [ 4 ] , and the design of mobile apps for diagnosing and screening for depression [ 33 ] . Many studies have also investigated the numerous benefts of uti - lizing digital resources for mental health support . Such benefts include helping to reduce depressive symptoms , alleviate fnancial strain by cutting down missed work hours , mitigate transportation burden to caregivers and patients , and improve access to mental CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Oguamanam et al . health delivery services and treatment to those who otherwise would not have access [ 1 , 52 , 73 , 111 ] . Despite the varying benefts reported within diferent social contexts , interventions in this do - main have predominantly been evaluated with White and Asian women [ 30 , 33 , 78 ] . There is a dearth of literature that specifcally examines how interventions can support racial and ethnic minority populations such as Black women—a group most vulnerable to poor maternal health [ 61 ] . Indeed , research investigating the context of prenatal and post - partum care among Black women is crucial considering the dis - proportionate number of gendered racial [ 43 ] disparities negatively impacting their wellbeing . U . S . Black women , for instance , have lower access to adequate prenatal care and mental health services [ 14 ] . Further , systemic racism and discrimination created many social , economic , and political inequities amongst this population . [ 43 , 76 ] . As a result , Black women experience chronic stressors [ 9 , 17 , 24 , 34 ] that heighten the risk of low infant birth - weight , preterm birth , and maternal depression . Within the prenatal and postpartum periods , they also encounter unique stressors such as adjusting to the role of motherhood , inadequate sleep , hormonal changes , and relationship strain [ 1 ] . Lastly , given the time during which this survey was administered ( i . e . , during the COVID - 19 pandemic ) , perinatal Black women were reported to be more likely to experience exposure to the coronavirus , hospitalization , and f - nancial burden—which in turn further exacerbated mental health issues [ 21 , 42 ] . Despite the increasingly alarming state of Black maternal mental health in the U . S , prior work shows that Black women underutilize professional services aimed at enhancing mental health or treat - ing disorders with a much lower frequency than women in other racial groups [ 72 , 74 ] . The underutilization of mental health ser - vices among Black women may be due in part to the numerous barriers that they experience in the process . Drawing from the literature , some of the barriers that are seemingly the most counter - productive to seeking mental health support within this population include cost , inadequate healthcare across socioeconomic groups , mistrust of providers , and less access to treatment [ 5 , 45 , 72 ] . Para - doxically , one barrier that has been shown to be both benefcial and detrimental for mental health promotion amongst this demo - graphic has been the pressure to adopt the “strong black woman” or “superwoman” persona [ 117 ] . Studies reveal that taking on this strong black women role serves as a coping mechanism for dealing with race - and gender - based discrimination in their everyday lives , while also serving as a catalyst to heightening chronic stressors that harm their overall wellbeing [ 2 , 116 , 116 ] . Technological innovation presents one opportunity to address barriers to care for Black women – with evidence suggesting they have favorable views towards utilizing digital platforms for men - tal health support [ 72 ] . A few studies have begun exploring Black women’s attitudes towards adopting such platforms . This body of literature reveals that Black women highly accept mobile apps , video calls , and telemedicine as alternative modes of support for communicating with a mental health professional [ 71 – 74 ] . Sim - ilarly , within the perinatal context , there is some evidence that mobile apps , social media , and text messages are both acceptable and feasible approaches for mental health management when com - pared against traditional methods ( e . g . , provider’s patient portal , print resources , and in - person services ) [ 16 , 18 , 44 , 49 , 61 ] amongst this demographic . While the acceptability and feasibility of novel interventions are important for discovering technological opportunities for support within this context , foundational work in HCI emphasizes the im - portance of understanding the current user landscape as a frst step in the design process of building interactive systems [ 60 , 80 , 92 ] . Yet , research has not explored perinatal Black women’s utilization and satisfaction with digital resources that they are currently using for mental health management . Furthermore , though Black women are not a monolith , many studies centered around Black women’s health tend to overlook the varied experiences of subgroups within this demographic [ 38 ] . This approach , however , can obscure the unique needs and perspectives of women with particular intersec - tional experiences and identities [ 27 ] and lead to designing inter - ventions that are either inefective or further exacerbate inequities for marginalized populations [ 5 , 104 ] . Our work answers recent calls within HCI to examine intersec - tional identities to efectively understand , celebrate , and design for the experiences of marginalized groups and people of color specif - cally [ 46 , 58 , 82 , 91 , 94 , 96 , 104 ] . As part of a larger mixed - methods study , we conducted a survey to examine the extent to which peri - natal Black women use digital mental health platforms and their level of satisfaction with such technologies . Furthermore , to go be - yond a general assessment of Black women’s experiences and gain an intersectional understanding , we investigated how these trends in use and satisfaction vary when examining subgroups . Specif - cally , we studied whether perinatal Black women’s utilization of and satisfaction with digital mental health support tools , such as telehealth platforms and apps , varied based on mental health status , pregnancy status ( i . e . , prenatal or postpartum ) , income level , educa - tional level , age , region , and adoption of the Superwoman Schema ( an intersectional framework that characterizes the persona of the strong Black woman ) . We then conducted a qualitative analysis on the responses to our open - ended question to examine coping strategies that were used by participants to alleviate stress . The specifc research questions guiding our work were : RQ1 ( a ) What digital resources are perinatal Black women utilizing for mental health support ? ( b ) How frequently are digital mental health resources being used amongst this population ? RQ2 How does frequency of use of digital mental health resources difer by ( a ) demographic factors , ( b ) mental health status , and ( c ) level of Superwoman Schema adoption ? RQ3 How does satisfaction with digital mental health resources difer by ( a ) demographic factors , ( b ) mental health status , and ( c ) level of Superwoman Schema adoption ? RQ4 How does satisfaction with telehealth difer by ( a ) demo - graphic factors , ( b ) mental health status , and ( c ) level of Superwoman Schema adoption ? To address our research questions , we surveyed 101 pregnant and postpartum U . S . Black / African American women . Findings from our statistical analysis show both high utilization of specifc digital tools for mental health amongst our sample ( i . e . , telehealth , social media , and apps ) and that frequency of use varied signifcantly by income level , education level , age , pregnancy status , and level of psychological distress . For example , we found that with respect to An Intersectional Look at Use of and Satisfaction with Digital Mental Health Platforms CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany app and education levels expressed higher usage . Furthermore , we found that women with higher levels of psychological distress , tended to use social media for mental health support more frequently . With regard to telehealth engagement , satisfaction with telehealth visits varied signifcantly by pregnancy status . Our results revealed that women with higher levels of dimensions of the SWS ( i . e . , motivation to succeed and resistance to being vulnerable ) had higher telehealth visit satisfaction and higher video calls usage respectively . Lastly , based on our qualitative analysis of the responses to the open - ended response question , the most common coping - responses to relieve stress included self - care , spiritual practices , social support , and professional help . These fndings help characterize how well existing digital re - sources are serving the mental health needs of perinatal Black women . We contribute the following to research on digital health in marginalized and underserved populations : ( 1 ) a more nuanced understanding of the use of digital mental health tools amongst pregnant and postpartum Black women and their level of satisfac - tion with these tools ( 2 ) a discussion of the ways in which under - standings of race and gender should shape digital health innovation and inquiry , and ( 3 ) design considerations for future digital health research focused on perinatal wellbeing in Black women . 2 RELATED WORK 2 . 1 Digital Health Interventions in the Prenatal and Postpartum Period In the HCI , Health Informatics , and CSCW communities , the explo - ration of digital health interventions for supporting women during the perinatal period is becoming more widespread . For instance , researchers have explored the use of SMS - based resources [ 11 , 89 ] and video - based interventions [ 57 ] to help new mothers share and seek pregnancy - related health information . Also , self - tracking ap - plications and systems have been investigated as potential tools for predicting pregnancy [ 65 ] and supporting the emotional and psy - chological wellbeing of perinatal women [ 51 ] . Recently , researchers have assessed the feasibility of telehealth services as an alternative approach to in - person therapy [ 6 , 52 ] , and with respect to their efectiveness in reducing depressive symptoms and reducing expo - sure to coronavirus for high - risk pregnant women [ 6 ] . Additionally , a number of studies have assessed the utilization of social media [ 4 , 10 ] or more generally , online communities [ 41 ] for increasing social support amongst pregnant and postpartum women . In addition to the wide range of digital mental health applications studied in this domain , scholars also explored innovative oppor - tunities for leveraging digital interventions to support activities such as screening and identifying women at risk for mental health challenges [ 30 ] . Such interventions were helpful for improving the quality of and access to healthcare delivery services [ 41 , 52 ] . For example , survey data [ 78 ] and data collected from social media platforms [ 29 , 31 ] have been reported to be efective in helping to build models for predicting and detecting postpartum depression in new moms . Early detection and screening of postpartum depression in new mothers is signifcant as research shows that postpartum depression is currently under - reported , under - diagnosed , and often misdiagnosed for women in the U . S . [ 29 , 31 , 78 ] . and self - tracking device usage , respondents with higher income Mobile - based applications were the most common digital health interventions assessed for their acceptability , feasibility , and efec - tiveness in supporting the screening , diagnosing , and / or treatment of perinatal anxiety and depression [ 33 , 49 , 93 , 99 , 110 , 114 ] . This focus primarily on mobile - based interventions may be due in part to the fact that more than a third of smartphone users fall within the age group of 18 - 34 , which coincides with the age range for a number of new moms in the western context [ 110 ] . Moreover , prior work reveals participant satisfaction , empowerment , and con - fdence towards mobile - based interventions in supporting the re - duction , management , and prevention of mental health symptoms in perinatal women [ 49 ] . Though mobile applications have been found to increase pregnant women’s self - efcacy in managing their maternal wellbeing [ 110 , 114 ] , there is also evidence that when deployed in real - world settings , perinatal digital mHealth apps tend to have low user - engagement and utilization . Spadaro et al . conducted a systematic review of 14 consumer perinatal mental health apps for screening and diagnosing mental health concerns [ 99 ] . They found that the majority of these tools had a low number of user reviews , which authors argued , attributed to low user engagement [ 99 ] . The authors posit that there is high demand for digital mental health resources for supporting perinatal wellbeing , as the existing tools and services are failing to meet the needs of this population [ 99 ] . Similarly , in a recent CHI study exploring the feasibility of a mobile - based mental health app for antenatal women , researchers found that racial and ethnic minority women were less likely to download the application compared to White European women despite the overall reporting of positive experiences of mobile app use in a real - world setting amongst the participants [ 33 ] . Further demonstrating the limited inclusivity in the digital maternal health research domain , interventions in this space have predominantly been evaluated with White and Asian women [ 30 , 33 , 78 ] . Little is known about how women who are most at risk for poor maternal health outcomes—including Black women—utilize and perceive digital mental health resources . 2 . 2 Tensions with Monolithic Approaches Within Digital Health for Underserved Perinatal Women It is critical that research on maternal health examine the strengths and needs of women from groups that disproportionately experi - ence health challenges ( e . g . , women in the global south , who are low - SES , and who come from racial and ethnic minority groups ) . Though this domain is underexplored , specifcally within the con - text of racial and ethnic minority groups in the U . S . , research shows that most maternal health interventions that take on a “one size fts all approach’ to digital health platforms , fail to meet the needs of marginalized and underserved groups [ 8 ] . Within the global south context , researchers have examined how cultural nuances and so - cioeconomic context impact who uses maternal health interven - tions and how they are received [ 7 , 120 ] . Many of the interventions in this space , however , have focused on pregnancy - related informa - tion sharing and seeking amongst women in low - socioeconomic ( low - SES ) communities [ 93 , 114 ] . For example , Mustafa et al . re - ported on how traditional and cultural norms such as family dynam - ics and religion can impact whether mobile maternal interventions CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Oguamanam et al . are adopted and used [ 77 ] . Similarly , leveraging a Feminist HCI study approach , Kumar et . al found that the efectiveness of their mobile - based intervention in supporting maternal health informa - tion dissemination for pregnant women in India relied signifcantly on the support of the men in the household ( e . g . husbands ) as well as the technical adeptness and availability of children in assisting new moms with navigating the app [ 57 ] . This work highlights a need for the design of digital interventions for maternal mental health to shift the focus from the individual level to a more ecologi - cal one . To paraphrase Bagalkot and collaborators , designers must go beyond standard digital health features such as health screenings to better meet the needs of ethnic minority women [ 8 ] . In the Western context , we similarly see that digital mental health research with perinatal racial and ethnic minority women , such as Black women , is sorely lacking . This work has primarily engaged women from majority racial groups [ 61 ] . For instance , Krashnewski et al . found that current maternal interventions are not meeting the needs of low - SES , primarily White , pregnant women [ 55 ] . Comparably , in their feasibility study of a mental health app for screening perinatal depression , Doherty et al . concluded that more research would be needed to explore cultural diferences that may emerge in the preferences of racial and ethnic minority women for perinatal mental health interventions [ 33 ] . In summary , there is a scarcity of research examining the utiliza - tion of and satisfaction with digital resources for perinatal mental health for racial and ethnic minority women—and Black women specifcally . This lack of research exists despite Black women expe - riencing the highest rates of maternal mortality , disproportionately high physical and mental health stressors , and disorders before and after pregnancy [ 19 , 48 , 66 , 98 ] . However , as researchers be - gin to explore this space , it is crucial that we “disrupt monolithic thinking” in the discussion of Black women and their mental well - being as recently reported in [ 38 ] . Notably , Erving et . al . leveraged an intersectionality framework to discover that levels of stress exposure based on discrimination , fnancial strain , and negative interactions with family members are strong predictors for adverse mental health outcomes amongst Black women [ 38 ] . More specif - cally , this survey study explored how disparities in mental health status amongst Black women in the U . S . varied across their intersec - tional identities ( i . e . , ethnicity , nativity , and socio - economic status ) [ 38 ] and found that Afro - Carribean born Black women tended to have better mental health outcomes compared to U . S . born Black women . High levels of educational attainment was also reported as a strong predictor of lower levels of depression . However , the rates of chronic PSTD was relatively the same across education level . Erving and collaborators ( 2021 ) importantly calls for future stud - ies exploring disparities in mental health status amongst U . S . Black women to investigate other subgroups among Black women [ 38 ] . Our work builds on this study in that we focus specifcally on utiliza - tion and satisfaction of digital health platforms among the perinatal Black women subgroup and we look at how use and satisfaction varies across intersecting identities—such as mental health status and demographic variables . Through our analysis , we contribute to the growing body of work in HCI focusing on intersectionality , [ 12 , 37 , 62 , 82 , 88 , 96 ] where there is an opportunity to combat monolithic thinking in the digital health space . 2 . 3 The Context : Black Women’s Use of and Attitudes Towards Mental Health Services There is growing research investigating factors that contribute to the under - utilization of mental health services amongst Black women . It has been reported that barriers to utilization amongst this population include access , socioeconomic limitations , discrimi - nation , stereotypes , stigma , inadequate care , and cultural factors [ 5 , 45 , 74 ] . Further , studies suggest that Black women are more likely to seek community - based ( i . e . , family , church , school , orga - nization ) resources in place of seeking professional mental health support [ 45 , 67 ] . Despite having a lower utilization of mental health services , the literature shows that Black women do have an interest in receiving such services and that views towards mental health support were positive [ 45 , 74 ] . This discrepancy between desire for and use of mental health services suggests that existing services are failing to meet the unique needs of Black women . Information and communication technologies ofer opportunities for addressing this gap between mental health service utilization and the desire for such services [ 49 , 61 ] . Recent work from McCall and collaborators [ 72 – 74 ] have propelled the feld of digital inter - ventions for mental health support amongst Black women forward . Findings from a survey study revealed that the use of text messages as a potential alternative to in - person therapy was not highly en - dorsed by Black women [ 73 ] . Notably , survey respondents were not asked about their current or past utilization of text messaging to communicate with healthcare providers , nor were perspectives on such current or past utilization presented . Instead , survey respon - dents were asked to consider how comfortable they might feel using text messaging to communicate with mental health professionals in the future . In another study , McCall’s mixed - methods approach to designing a culturally - tailored mobile app intervention for mental health management was positively received by U . S . Black women [ 74 ] , despite research fndings that culturally appropriate interven - tions were not sufcient in changing perceptions around mental health services in Black mothers [ 67 ] . Lastly , in a 2019 survey conducted with 102 U . S . Black women , McCall et al . examined the acceptability of receiving mental health professional support through telemedicine [ 72 ] . The researchers found that telemedicine via mobile - based video calls were highly acceptable in this population as a potential alternative to in - person mental health services . Also , acceptability varied across subgroups ( i . e . , acceptance level was reported higher in younger women with college degrees ) [ 72 ] . As with the 2020 survey study [ 73 ] , respon - dents in this 2019 study were asked to consider how comfortable they might be using digital mental health services in the future . In summary , this important body of work has characterized Black women’s perspectives on how technology might support their men - tal health needs when used in the future , and evaluated perspec - tives on digital mental health interventions introduced through research studies . However , to our knowledge , prior work has rarely investigated how Black women are currently using technology in present - day to address their mental health needs , and how satisfed they are with such tools . Addressing this gap , our work seeks to compliment prior work by investigating how Black women are currently using digital plat - forms to support their mental health needs and how satisfed they An Intersectional Look at Use of and Satisfaction with Digital Mental Health Platforms CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany are with these tools . Such a foundational understanding of current use and attitudes is vital for helping inform future innovation and research . Indeed , foundational research in HCI emphasizes the im - portance of frst understanding the current use of digital platforms in a design space prior to creating new systems [ 60 , 80 , 92 ] . Un - derstanding the current platforms that Black women are utilizing to address their mental health needs may provide us with a more in - depth understanding of previous fndings from the acceptability and feasibility studies of new digital health interventions amongst this population . Additionally , to guide the design and evaluation of future digital mental health systems for Black women , it is es - sential that we evaluate the existing , naturalistic use patterns of currently - available technologies , and what is and is not working for women as they use technology in the course of their daily lives . Moreover , our work contributes a particular focus on digital mental health support for Black women during the prenatal and postpartum periods . During these periods , perinatal women experi - ence unique stressors such as adjusting to the role of motherhood , inadequate sleep , hormonal changes , and relationship strain [ 1 ] . Additionally , given the time during which this survey was adminis - tered ( i . e . , during the COVID - 19 pandemic ) , perinatal Black women were reported to be more likely to experience exposure to the coro - navirus , hospitalization , and fnancial burden than women from other racial and ethnic groups—which in turn further exacerbated mental health issues [ 42 , 85 ] . Most notably however , digital inter - ventions for mental health support tend to focus on self - care ( i . e . , attending to the needs of the individual ) [ 88 ] , which in fact , con - tradicts how self - care has historically been perceived within the context of Black motherhood [ 23 , 40 , 79 ] . For many Black mothers , self - care is dynamic is nature and encompasses maternal sacrifces and an image of strength . To in order avoid the risk being portrayed as a bad mother [ 23 , 79 ] , one must adhere to the evolving needs of self , children , family , and communities . The guilt and shame that comes with being perceived as a bad mother can be even more detrimental to the mental health of our study population . Researchers have called for work investigating the unique and cultural needs of racial and ethnic perinatal women within the digital mental health space , as they are more at - risk for experi - encing anxiety and depression when compared to other groups of women [ 61 ] . To date , a few randomized controlled trial studies have began reporting on patient satisfaction with and acceptability of digital mental health interventions delivered through mobile phones / telephones [ 39 , 44 ] , social media [ 16 ] , the internet [ 28 ] , text - messages [ 18 ] , and telehealth [ 87 ] . However , this space is under - explored [ 61 ] . Specifcally , to our knowledge , research has not ex - plored the current utilization of digital platforms for mental health support in depth amongst this population , during the perinatal period specifcally , and across subgroups of Black women . It is vital that future interventions providing digital resources for mental health support are informed by an understanding of the current utilization of tools for women who are most at risk for poor mental health outcomes . 3 METHODS Our study was reviewed and approved by our university’s Insti - tutional Review Board ( IRB ) . From January 2021 - April 2021 , we administered an online survey with perinatal Black women to de - termine whether dimensions of the SWS , demographic variables , and mental health status were associated with ( 1 ) the spectrum of digital mental health tools and services used , ( 2 ) frequency of use of these tools , and ( 3 ) level of satisfaction with these tools . 3 . 1 Recruitment and Study Context We utilized a recruitment survey company , Qualtrics , to recruit and disseminate our survey materials to participants . In a recent call to HCI researchers to adopt more inclusive recruitment methods for recruiting hard - to - reach populations for technological research [ 119 ] , utilizing anonymous web - survey platforms ( e . g . , Qualtrics ) was referenced as a cost - efcient approach for reaching marginal - ized groups . This approach proved to be particularly benefcial for reaching our study sample during a time , such as the COVID - 19 pandemic , when there were social distancing mandates in place to help reduce the spread of the disease for high risk groups ( e . g . , pregnant women ) [ 119 ] . In general , the recruitment process via Qualtrics leverages an internal survey research panel and distribution system . Participants are matched to a list of readily available surveys in which they are eligible for based on the background information they provide upon joining the research panel . The distribution system uses sub - demographic quotas , such as income and pregnancy status , to help research investigators get as close having a sample representative of the population . Our team in particular , provided Qualtrics with our desired quotas along with our recruitment fyer and website information , consent form , participant screener , and survey link . Participants were compensated directly by Qualtrics . Due to the nature of participants joining the survey panels from a variety of sources , the Qualtrics recruitment team requires participants to choose from a selection of compensation optionsand agree on their preferred choice of compensation prior to doing any survey . Unfor - tunately , the research investigators are not privy to compensation selections ofered by the Qualtrics recruitment policy . For more in - formation about the Qualtrics’ process for recruiting , compensating , and / or consenting participants , please refer to the supplementary materials . The consent form , participant screener , and survey were hosted on the Qualtrics online survey platform . The main survey took on average 28 minutes to complete . Of the 303 participants who attempted the survey , there were 101 participants whom had met the inclusion criteria ( i . e . , 18 + years of age , self - identifed as female , self - identifed as Black / African American or bi - racial with one of those races being Black / African America , understood English , and were either pregnant or recently delivered a baby in the period March 2020 - April 2021 ) , and were prompted to read the consent form and provide electronic consent in order to move forward with completing the full survey . We excluded survey responses in which there were low - quality answers to the open - ended questions ( e . g . , gibberish , nonsensical responses ) or a pattern of straight lining . Additionally , we excluded data from survey responses in which the completion time was deemed to be too short ( i . e . , suggesting speeding ) —any surveys completed in 8 minutes or less . This quality assessment and fltering process resulted in a total of 101 valid survey responses in total . Table 1 : Demographic Characteristics ( N = 101 ) CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Oguamanam et al . 3 . 2 . 3 Demographic Information . Finally , Section 10 collected data on sociodemographic factors including participants’ ethnicity and race , location , age , gestational age , income , educational level , and health insurance status . 3 . 2 Survey Metrics We designed the survey instrument through several iterations on the content and structure . We iteratively pilot tested the survey with 10 participants to identify technical concerns ( e . g . , survey logic ) , assess survey completion time , and to validate word choice . The fnal survey included 70 questions , including one attention - check question and consisted of matrix questions , multiple choice , open - ended questions , and fve - point Likert scale questions . The survey instrument is available in the accompanying supplementary materials . The survey contains ten sections : In Sections 1 – 4 , we ask about stress / anxiety / depression . In Sections 5 – 9 , we ask about technology use . Lastly , in Section 10 we ask about demographic information . 3 . 2 . 1 Mental Health Status . Sections 1 – 4 focus specifcally on mea - suring participants’ experiences of stress , anxiety , and depression . Section 1 assesses maternal stress and anxiety , using the validated Pandemic - Related Pregnancy Stress Scale ( PREPS ) [ 90 ] . From this scale , we capture stressors related to COVID - 19 , which is the con - text in which this data was collected . Though we do not report on these fndings in this paper , a discussion on how the pandemic may have impacted our fndings is presented later . Section 2 of the survey measured participants’ level of adoption of the superwoman schema [ 118 ] . This validated scale assesses each component of the Superwoman Schema framework : Obligation to Present an Image of Strength , Obligation to Suppress Emotions , Resistance to Being Vulnerable , Intense Motivation to Succeed , and Obligation to Help Others . Section 3 measures maternal depression using the Edin - burgh Postnatal Depression Scale ( EPDS ) [ 25 ] . Section 4 measures overall psychological distress , depression and generalized anxiety using both the General Anxiety Disorder Scale ( GAD - 7 ) [ 101 ] and the Patient Health Questionnaire - 4 ( PHQ - 4 ) [ 56 ] . 3 . 2 . 2 Technology Use . Section 5 assesses general technology ac - cess ( e . g . , Internet access and usage ) while Sections 6 – 9 focus more specifcally on the use of digital health platforms , and attitudes towards these tools . Section 6 measures use and satisfaction of a variety of resources for mental health including digital tools ( e . g . , apps , self - tracking devices , video calls , and social media ) as well as print resources ( e . g , pamphlets ) . Sections 7 and 8 focus on tele - health experience and satisfaction ( i . e . , virtual visits with health providers during the pandemic ) . Section 9 is shown to participants that have indicated in Section 7 that they have not had a virtual visit during / after their most recent pregnancy during the pandemic . In this section , questions focus on assessing reasons why partici - pants have not had such virtual visits . The questions in Sections 7 - 9 were adapted from the Live Health Online ( LHO ) Telehealth Patient Survey [ 64 ] assessing telehealth use and non - use . The sub - set of questions was selected and modifed to focus on our specifc research questions .

Specifcally , we asked participants : " What is one way that you relieve your stress , anxiety , depression , etc . ? " . Out of the 101 participants , 100 % of participants provided an answer to the open - response question . 3 . 4 Ethical Considerations and Procedures As mental health is a sensitive topic , our research team adminis - tered safety precautions to address the ethical implication of work and mitigate potential harm and risks for our study sample . We met in multiple rounds with three distinct institutions’ research ethics boards to discuss and validate the recruitment materials , methods , and language as it relates to properly managing the sensitivity and potential risks of our study protocol . Also , the three authors with health expertise and experience in conducting sensitive research with our studied demographic ( i . e . , Authors 2 , 3 , and 4 ) , provided guidance to the remaining authors on best practices for respond - ing to severe disclosures of mental health issues and / or troubling moods . The language provided in our consent form emphasized that participation was on a completely voluntary basis and that An Intersectional Look at Use of and Satisfaction with Digital Mental Health Platforms participants could exit the survey at any point and would receive full compensation without penalty . Additionally , a list of culturally - relevant mental health resources and suicide hotline contact numbers was curated and listed on the consent form , recruitment website and at the end of the survey [ see supplementary materials ] for those who may have felt triggered from participating in our study . The consent materials were made clear to ensure that participants knew exactly what to expect upon participation , the risks and benefts , and the contact information and mental health resources to consult if needed . Because this work was a collaborative efort among various institutions , our study protocol received full approval from the research ethics review boards across three universities . We recommend that all future research teams produce a protocol in place in addition to these resources for work that deals with similarly sensitive topics and where participants may be vulnerable to mental health risks . 3 . 5 Analysis Descriptive statistics were computed for the quantitative survey data , including the mean with standard deviation for continuous variables and frequency with percentages for categorical variables . For each validated scale , scoring was completed according to the instructions accompanying the scale . One - way Analysis of Vari - ance ( ANOVA ) was used to compare the categorical variables . That statistical software package , SPSS , was used to perform data man - agement and data analysis where statistical signifcance of p < 0 . 05 was utilized . To better contextualize the fndings from our sta - tistical analysis and inform our design considerations , we then qualitatively coded the open - ended response question from our survey leveraging open coding technique inspired by a grounded theory approach [ 105 ] . The frst author administered an inductive approach to openly code the responses in an iterative manner using spreadsheets and ATLAS . ti . Next , the frst and last author met to discuss and interpret the meaning of the data and refect on the rela - tionship of the codes within the context of the quantitative fndings . Finally , the codes were iteratively revised and shaped to eventually form high - level themes . We describe our statistical analysis results along with these emergent themes along below in the Findings section . 4 FINDINGS Our survey data analysis provides a detailed picture of digital men - tal health platform use and satisfaction amongst Black pregnant and postpartum women . In this section , we begin by providing an overview of our survey respondents , summarizing demographic information , and overall levels of reported general mental health status across our respondents . These fndings provide helpful con - text for the sections that follow , in which we report survey fndings that help to answer our research questions . 4 . 1 Demographic Characteristics In total , there were valid surveys completed by 101 participants . We provide an overview of our participants’ demographic character - istics in Table 1 . All participants identifed as female and , racially , as Black / African American ( N = 101 ) . Approximately 92 % ( N = CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Table 2 : Overview of Mental Health and SWS Variables ( N = 101 ) Frequency ( n ) Percent ( % ) Anxiety ( GAD - 7 ) Minimal 27 26 . 7 Mild 39 38 . 6 Moderate 22 21 . 8 Severe 12 11 . 9 Psychological Distress ( PHQ - 4 ) None 27 26 . 7 Mild 31 30 . 7 Moderate 24 23 . 8 Severe 18 17 . 8 SWS Adoption Low SWS 3 3 . 0 Moderate SWS 44 43 . 6 High SWS 53 52 . 5 Postnatal Depression Low 25 24 . 7 High 75 74 . 3 93 ) identifed ethnically as non - Hispanic and 12 % ( N = 12 ) iden - tifed as bi - racial—with 8 % ( N = 8 ) self - identifying as Hispanic or Latino / Latina ) . Close to half of participants , 47 % ( N = 48 ) fell in the 25 - 34 year old age range , 36 % ( N = 37 ) ranged in age from 18 - 24 , 16 % ( N = 15 ) ranged in age from 35 - 44 , and 1 % ( N = 1 ) ranged in age from 45 - 54 years . Just over half of participants were postpartum 52 % ( N = 52 ) , 49 % ( N = 49 ) were currently pregnant . Of those participants who were currently pregnant , 3 % ( N = 3 ) had also recently delivered a baby in the past 12 months . For the purposes of our analysis , these three individuals were included in our “pregnant” participant group only ( and not the postpartum group ) . At the time of completing the survey , all participants lived in the U . S . , with 49 % ( N = 49 ) in the Southern U . S . , 16 % ( N = 16 ) in the Western U . S . , 20 % ( N = 20 ) North - eastern U . S . , and 16 % ( N = 16 ) Midwestern U . S . Following guidelines used to determine eligibility for federal aid programs ( e . g . , reduced price school meals ) , participants were classifed as low - income if their household income was less than or equal to 185 % of the U . S . Federal Poverty Level for their household size . Socioeconomic status ( SES ) was computed using participants’ household income range , family size , and Federal Poverty Guidelines [ 81 ] . Approxi - mately 49 % ( N = 49 ) were classifed as low - income , 43 % ( N = 43 ) as middle to upper - income , and 9 % ( N = 9 ) chose not to disclose income information . Regarding education level , approximately 43 % ( N = 43 ) had less than a bachelor’s degree , 33 % ( N = 33 ) obtained a college degree , and 25 % ( N = 25 ) had a graduate degree . 4 . 2 Baseline Technology Usage Participants were asked to report on their general access to tech - nology . When asked about device ownership of either a computer , tablet , or smartphone , approximately 98 % ( N = 99 ) answered ‘yes’ and 2 ( N = 2 ) answered ‘no’ . Approximately 90 % ( N = 91 ) ‘frequently’ accessed the internet , 9 % ( N = 9 ) reported having occasional access CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Oguamanam et al . to the internet , and 1 % ( N = 1 ) reported never having access to the internet . Approximately , 60 % ( N = 61 ) of the respondents access the internet at home from a computer , tablet , or smartphone device . 4 . 3 Overview of Generalized Anxiety Disorder Results ( GAD - 7 ) To assess participants’ levels of anxiety and presence of generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD ) , we utilized the self - report 7 - item ( GAD - 7 ) anxiety scale [ 101 ] . While it is common to have worries from time to time , the GAD - 7 scale assesses more chronic worry and anxiety that interferes with daily life and that is hard to control . Scoring for each item in the scale ranges from 0 to 3 . Hence , scoring for the overall GAD - 7 scale ranges from 0 to 21 . Minimal , mild , moderate , and severe levels of anxiety are represented by cut points of 4 , 9 , 14 , and 21 respectively . A score of 10 or greater indicates the presence of GAD in an individual [ 101 ] . As summarized in Table 2 , 38 . 6 % ( N = 39 ) reported mild levels of anxiety , 26 . 7 ( N = 27 ) reported minimal levels of anxiety , 21 . 8 % ( N = 22 ) reported moderate levels of anxiety , and 11 . 9 % ( N = 12 ) reported severe levels of anxiety . Overall , respondents appeared to have low anxiety levels at the time of completing this survey . 4 . 4 Overview of Psychological Distress Results ( PHQ - 4 ) The 4 - item Patient Health Questionnaire - 4 ( PHQ - 4 ) enables a com - posite measure of depression and anxiety , providing an overall assessment of psychological distress [ 56 ] . Scoring ranges from 0 to 12 . The levels of psychological distress captured through this scale were : none ( score of 0 – 2 ) , mild ( score of 3 – 5 ) , moderate ( score of 6 – 8 ) , and severe ( score of 9 – 12 ) . Most participants reported some level of psychological distress . 30 . 1 % out of the 101 respondents ( N = 31 ) , reported mild levels of psychological distress , 23 . 8 % ( N = 24 ) reported moderate levels of psychological distress , and 17 . 8 % ( N = 18 ) reported severe levels of psychological distress . 27 % of respondents ( 26 . 7 ) , reported no level of psychological distress as summarized in Table 2 . 4 . 5 Overview of Postnatal Depression Results ( EPDS ) The 10 - item self - report Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale ( EPDS ) [ 25 ] was used to assess levels of postnatal depression amongst post - partum participants . Items are scored between 0 - 3 . It is important to note that this is a screening tool and that scoring high on this scale is not a diagnosis . The cut point for high levels of postpartum de - pression symptoms ranged from 9 – 13 . That is , a score of 9 or higher is indication that the patient should have an immediate follow - up appointment regarding their psychological well being [ 25 ] . Though EDPS has been widely used during postpartum depression , it has become a validated and recommended tool to use for screening depression during the prenatal period . Accordingly , all respondents were given access to the EDPS subsection of the survey [ 3 , 13 , 107 ] . Amongst our participants , 74 . 3 % ( N = 75 ) expressed high levels of postpartum depression and 24 . 7 % ( N = 25 ) expressed low levels of postpartum depression as summarized in Table 2 . 4 . 6 Adoption of the Superwoman Schema ( SWS ) The 35 - item Superwoman Schema ( SWS ) Framework [ 118 ] Ques - tionnaire was used to assess respondents’ level of adoption of the SWS . The SWS framework questionnaire consists of fve subscales : Obligation to Present an Image of Strength , Obligation to Suppress Emotions , Resistance to Being Vulnerable , Intense Motivation to Succeed , and Obligation to Help Others [ 118 ] . Each item is scored from 0 to 3 . Overall scoring of the questionnaire ranges from 0 to 105 . A low SWS score ranges between 0 - 35 , moderate score ranges between 36 - 70 , and high SWS score ranges from 71 - 105 [ 118 ] . Overall , Table 2 shows that 52 . 5 % ( N = 53 ) of respondents scored high on the SWS questionnaire , 44 . 6 % ( N = 45 ) scored moderately , and a small percentage of participants ( 2 . 9 % , N = 3 ) scored low . As such , the vast majority of our participants expressed at least moderate levels of adoption of the superwoman role , with just over half of participants indicating high adoption of this role . Given that adoption of the SWS has been associated with increased mental distress in prior work [ 2 , 117 , 118 ] , our own SWS fndings help to provide one potential explanation for the high prevalence of anxiety , postnatal depression , and psychological distress in our sample . 4 . 7 RQ1 : Overall Frequency of Use of Digital Resources We now describe our survey fndings that help to answer each of our research questions . Our frst question examines what digital resources pregnant and postpartum Black women use to address their mental health concerns , and the frequency with which they use them . First , we want to acknowledge that the provided list of resources included in our survey have overlapping interpretations . However , to simplify how participants may have interpreted these various categorizations , we provided concrete examples for each resource . For the full list of digital resources along with the provided examples , see Table 3 or supplementary materials . Overall , mental health resources were widely used by partici - pants . Approximately , 88 . 1 % of participants ( N = 89 ) reported using resources to address their mental health during or after their most recent pregnancy , while only 11 . 9 % of participants ( N = 12 ) indi - cated that they had not used any resources to address their mental health . Survey respondents cited using several resources during the perinatal period , as summarized in Table 3 . We focus our analysis on the digital mental health resources used by the greatest number of participants . 52 . 5 % ( N = 53 ) said they have used social media to address their mental health concerns , 49 . 5 % ( N = 50 ) have used apps , 32 . 7 % ( N = 33 ) have used self - tracking devices , and 31 . 7 % ( N = 32 ) have used video calls . Our fndings show that digital mental health resources such as social media and apps are utilized by twice as many respondents as print resources . After indicating which resources they have used to address their mental health , participants were asked to report how often they have used each resource . Answers were reported using a 5 - point Likert scale : 1 ( never ) , 2 ( rarely ) , 3 ( sometimes ) , 4 ( often ) , and 5 ( very often ) . For our analysis , we focus on assessing associations between frequency of use of digital resources for mental health support and our subgroup demographic variables ( i . e . , pregnancy status , income level , education level , and geographic region ) . We performed this An Intersectional Look at Use of and Satisfaction with Digital Mental Health Platforms CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Table 3 : Overview of Digital Resources for Mental Health Support ( N = 101 ) Mental Health Resources * Count Percent Social Media ( e . g . , Instagram , Facebook , etc . ) 53 52 . 5 Apps ( e . g . , Calm , Headspace , etc . ) 50 49 . 5 Self - tracking Devices ( e . g . , Apple Watch , Fitbit , etc . ) 33 32 . 7 Video Calls ( e . g . , Facetime , Zoom etc . ) 32 31 . 7 Print Resources ( e . g . , pamphlets , self - help books , etc . ) 27 26 . 7 Online Therapist Directories ( e . g . , PsychologyToday ) 24 23 . 8 Podcasts ( e . g . , TherapyForBlackGirls , BlackGirlInOm , etc . ) 22 21 . 8 Email 21 20 . 8 Not Applicable / None of the Above 12 11 . 9 Other 4 4 . 0 * Multiple answers can be selected for this question . analysis for the four digital resources that were cited as being used by the largest number of participants : apps , self - tracking devices , social media , and video calls . 4 . 8 RQ2a : Diferences in Frequency of Use of Digital Resources by Demographic Factors We investigated whether there existed an efect of demographic factors ( i . e . , pregnancy status , income , education , and region ) on the frequency of digital mental health resource use ( i . e . , apps , self - tracking devices , social media , and video calls ) . See Tables 4 and 5 . 4 . 8 . 1 App Use . There was an efect of education and income level on the use of mobile apps for mental health support . App usage was higher by those with higher income , F ( 2 , 47 ) = 3 . 99 , p = 0 . 025 , d = 0 . 15 , with ( M = 4 . 53 , SD = . 74 ) , and by those with higher educational attainment F ( 2 , 47 ) = 5 . 94 , p = 0 . 005 , d = 0 . 20 , with ( M = 6 . 46 , SD = 0 . 37 ) . Additionally , we found that the use of apps for mental health support was not statistically signifcantly diferent compared with pregnancy status , region , or age . 4 . 8 . 2 Self - tracking Device Use . Our results reveal education and income were found to infuence self - tracking device usage for men - tal health support in a statistically signifcantly way . Similar to app usage for mental health support , self - tracking device usage was higher in respondents with higher income , F ( 2 , 30 ) = 5 . 50 , p = 0 . 009 , d = 0 . 27 , with ( M = 4 . 31 , SD = 0 . 87 ) , and by those with higher educational attainment , F ( 2 , 30 ) = 7 . 78 , p = 0 . 002 , d = 0 . 34 , with ( M = 4 . 58 , SD = 0 . 67 ) . We found no statistically signifcant diferences in the use of self - tracking devices for mental health support across pregnancy status , region , or age groups . 4 . 8 . 3 Social Media Use . There were no statistically signifcantly diferences for any of the demographic variables collected and the use of social media for mental health support . This indicates that these demographic variables exert no efect on social media usage . 4 . 8 . 4 Video Call Use . We found an efect of pregnancy status and region on the use of video calls for mental health support . Video calls were used with higher frequency by women who were cur - rently pregnant , F ( 1 , 30 ) = 5 . 58 , p = 0 . 025 , d = 0 . 157 , with ( M = 4 . 06 , SD = 1 . 09 ) . Additionally , there was a statistically signifcantly difer - ence in video call use by region , F ( 3 , 28 ) = 4 . 17 , p = 0 . 015 , d = 0 . 31 ; specifcally , between participants based in South and Northeast region of the U . S . with participants in the South demonstrating higher video call use , ( M = 4 . 36 , SD = 0 . 84 ) ; p = . 02 . There was no statistically signifcant diference in use of video calls for income , age , or educational level . 4 . 9 RQ2b : Diferences in Frequency of Use of Digital Resources by Mental Health Status Secondly , we sought to examine the efect of levels of anxiety and depression on the frequency of digital mental health resource use . There was no statistically signifcantly diference in use of digital resources for either level of anxiety or level of depression . However , there was a statistically signifcantly diference in social media use by level of psychological distress F ( 3 , 48 ) = 3 . 41 , p = 0 . 025 , d = 0 . 18 ; specifcally between participants with moderate and mild levels of psychological distress with respondents who report mild psychological distress demonstrating higher video call use , with ( M = 4 . 33 , SD = 0 . 89 ) ; p = . 04 . 4 . 10 RQ2c : Diferences in Frequency of Use of Digital Resources by SWS Adoption Level Lastly , our second research question sought to examine the efect of the SWS adoption levels on the frequency of digital mental health resource use . There were no statistically signifcantly diferences for any of the SWS adoption levels with the use of video calls , apps , and social media use . However , fndings reveal that respondents with higher levels of resistance to being vulnerable reported a statistically signifcantly higher frequency of self - tracking device use , F ( 2 , 30 ) = 2 . 63 , p = 0 . 036 , d = 0 . 13 , with ( M = 4 . 23 , SD = 0 . 93 ) . Notably , we did not have many participants in the low resistance to vulnerability category ( N = 4 ) . Hence , their data was excluded for analysis . 4 . 11 RQ3a : Diferences in Satisfaction with Digital Resources by Demographic Factors After indicating which resources they have used to address their mental health , participants were asked to report their satisfaction with each resource . Answers were reported using a 5 - point Likert scale ranging from 1 ( very dissatisfed ) to 5 ( very satisfed ) . For our CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Oguamanam et al .

SWS adoption exert no efect on satisfaction with digital mental health resources . 4 . 14 RQ4a : Diferences in Satisfaction with Telehealth by Demographic Factors In our survey , " telehealth " was defned as having a virtual visit with a healthcare provider via phone , computer , tablet , etc . rather than in - ofce . ( see supplementary materials ) . Overall , with regard to level of satisfaction with telehealth visits , our results revealed that 69 . 3 % ( N = 71 ) participants had at least one Telehealth visit during / after their most recent pregnancy . Amongst the participants who had at least one Telehealth visit , 78 . 9 % ( N = 56 ) discussed their mental health during the visit , 19 . 7 % ( N = 14 ) reported “no” to discussing their mental health , and 1 . 4 % ( N = 1 ) reported “I am not sure / I prefer not to answer” . Given the statement , “In general , I was satisfed with my Telehealth visits , ” participants reported their level of satisfaction using a 5 - point Likert scale ranging from 1 ( strongly disagree ) to 5 ( strongly agree ) . For our fnal research question , we frst examined the efect of demographic factors on satisfaction with telehealth visits as sum - marized in Table 8 . We found that there was an efect of pregnancy status and age on level of satisfaction with telehealth platforms . Satisfaction with telehealth was higher for those respondents who were postpartum , F ( 1 , 68 ) = 9 . 29 , p = 0 . 001 , d = 0 . 22 , with ( M = 4 . 48 , SD = 0 . 71 ) and by those who were older , F ( 2 , 67 ) = 3 . 41 , p = 0 . 022 , d = 0 . 13 , with ( M = 4 . 31 , SD = 0 . 75 ) . There were no statistically signifcantly diferences for the remaining demographic variables collected ( i . e . , income , education , and region ) and satisfaction with telehealth . Oguamanam et al . 4 . 15 RQ4b : Diferences in Satisfaction with Telehealth by Mental Health Status Next , we investigated the efect of mental health status on satis - faction with telehealth platforms . Satisfaction with telehealth plat - forms was not statistically signifcantly diferent compared with level of anxiety , depression , and psychological distress . 4 . 16 RQ4c : Diferences in Satisfaction with Telehealth by SWS Adoption Levels Lastly , we examined the efect of level of SWS Adoption on the satisfaction with telehealth . There was no statistically signifcantly diference in level of satisfaction with telehealth visits between the levels of overall SWS adoption . However , results show that one dimension of the SWS framework [ 118 ] ( i . e . , intense motivation to succeed ) was found to infuence satisfaction with telehealth visits . Respondents with higher levels of intense motivation to succeed reported a statistically signifcantly higher level of satisfaction with telehealth visits , F ( 1 , 69 ) = 5 . 25 , p = 0 . 025 , d = 0 . 71 , with ( M = 4 . 24 , SD = 1 . 01 ) . 4 . 17 Qualitative Findings To help contextualize the quantitative results described in the afore - mentioned sections , we present fndings from our qualitative analy - sis of the responses to our open - ended response question : " What is one way that you relieve your stress , anxiety , depression , etc . ? " . All of our 101 participants provided an answer to this question . 94 . 1 % of respondents ( N = 95 ) responded to this question by describing the stress coping strategies that they use , while the remaining 5 . 94 % of respondents ( N = 6 ) chose to either discuss their current mental health state ( N = 4 ) or responded with “I do not know” ( N = 2 ) . Our analysis of this data revealed that respondents relied on a variety of coping strategies to manage their maternal stress . Notably , of the 94 . 1 % of respondents who discussed their coping strategies—all of these women reported using active coping strategies ( i . e . , adaptive measures to control or reduce stressful situations ) [ 86 ] . Respon - dents discussed using strategies such as relying on social support , spiritual practices , and self - care . No participants described using avoidant coping strategies ( i . e . , maladaptive measures taken to es - cape , disengage , or minimize the stressor ) [ 86 ] . The lack of avoidant coping discussed in our data is noteworthy given that avoidant cop - ing strategies such as substance abuse are linked to increased stress and the onset of depressive symptoms in the future [ 47 ] . Throughout the perinatal period , new mothers encounter unique stressors such as adjusting to the role of motherhood , inadequate sleep , relationship strain , and hormonal changes [ 1 ] . The 3 . 92 % of participants ( N = 4 ) who chose to describe their current mental state during this period varied in how they felt – with feelings ranging from being in a positive mental state to feeling uneasy . P6 described her mental state in this way : I feel really happy at times and then afraid this really do suck . Similarly , P10 described her anxiousness around managing her maternal duties amidst pandemic - related stressors : I am constantly anxious , worried about avoiding con - tact with people for the sake of myself and my baby . An Intersectional Look at Use of and Satisfaction with Digital Mental Health Platforms CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany These quotes help provide a small window into the varied emotions that pregnant and postpartum women have experienced amidst the pandemic , including the stress arising from having to protect not only oneself but a new child amidst a public health emergency . With this context in mind , in the remainder of this section , we discuss the four primary active coping strategies our participants used to cope with stress . When considered in conjunction with the rest of our survey results , these qualitative fndings help provide a more complete picture of the steps the women in our sample were taking to manage their mental health . By highlighting these existing practices , our fndings can help to inform the creation of future mental health promotion tools that integrate and support valued coping practices amongst perinatal Black women . 4 . 17 . 1 Self - Care Strategies . Our analysis showed that our partici - pants primarily relied on self - care strategies to manage and reduce their stress . Out of the 101 participants , 77 . 2 % of respondents ( N = 78 ) referenced self - care strategies as coping mechanisms for stress relief . Self - care relies on activities involving unconventional ther - apeutic practices such as exercise and meditation to help with alleviating stress . Often , participants described these strategies as taking time for themselves . For example , P53 described her need for : Me time alone daily . These sentiments were echoed by P72 , who stated that one of her strategies included " spending time reading alone " . P48 also emphasized spending time alone , stating that she tries to have : Me time at least 30 mins daily . Regardless of the activity , participants seemed to value having ded - icated time during the day that was just for them . P18 summarized this strategy as “having a ’me time’ everyday” . Given how challeng - ing it can be for new and expectant moms to have “me - time” , our fndings suggest that future work should explore the design of tools that can help women activate their support networks to obtain this “time” . In the remainder of this section , we describe the three most - cited self - care techniques that emerged from our fndings : music - based activities , mindfulness and relaxation activities , and physical activity . Music - based Activities . The most frequent sub - theme that emerged from our analysis of self - care practices centered around listening to music and calming sounds . Roughly , 27 . 8 % ( N = 28 ) of the partici - pants cited listening to music and / or nature - based sounds a coping response to stressful situations . Interestingly , participants tended to cite music - based activities as a sufcient form of coping for stress relief . Typical responses came from participants who stated : Music helps me clear my mind almost every day . ( P81 ) Music is the best coping skill . ( P23 ) Another respondent described her form of coping as : “vibe [ ing ] music and rain sound because it feel [ s ] calming and nice " ( P17 ) . Participant 95 said the following about the power of music : I listen to music . It serves as an escape . Participants leveraged music to alleviate stress and achieve a mental state of calm . This theme is consistent with previous work that suggests that engaging in music - based practices such as playing an instrument , singing , or listening to music helps to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety [ 95 ] . Moreover , music - based therapy has been used to treat pregnancy - related stress and anxiety in women and birthing people [ 108 ] . Mindfulness & Relaxation Activities . Another theme that emerged from our analysis was the use of mindfulness - based practices . Mind - fulness activities require an individual’s attention and awareness in the present moment [ 121 ] . Closely related activities include those focused on relaxation . 16 . 8 % of participants ( N = 17 ) reported us - ing mindfulness or relaxation - focused practices to address their mental health needs . They described a variety of practices , such as breathing , meditation , sleeping , and resting . Participants often cited multiple of these practices together . One participant mentioned that she manages her stress through : Sleeep and relaxation in things [ she ] enjoy doing such as art ( P89 ) . Similarly , another participant stated : Having enough sleep is what I have always been doing also sometimes i meditate ( P48 ) . While “meditation” was cited as a sufcient source of coping for a few participants ( P27 , P82 , P89 ) , others reported needed a combina - tion of meditation , “food [ and ] sleep” ( P14 ) . Additionally , respon - dents also described a variety of breathing techniques for relieving stress : Taking a deep breath ( P36 ) . I breath in and out ( P65 ) . I take a moment to breathe ( P47 ) . Outside of relaxation and mindfulness techniques , a few partici - pants described engaging in self - care activities for the sole purpose of relaxation . For instance , P74 stated : Do [ ing ] someth [ i ] ng that helps me relax like watch [ i ] ng my favorite channel . The centrality of relaxation and mindfulness techniques for many of our participants resonates with the growing body of HCI literature documenting the benefts of mindfulness on the mental wellbeing of the general population and ofers opportunities for technology to support this design space [ 63 , 109 ] . Physical Activity . Finally , our participants described using physi - cal activity as a self - care practice . We defne physical activity as any form of activity involving body movement . Participants engaged in a range of physical activity from walking to boxing . 12 . 9 % of the participants ( N = 13 ) cited physical activity as a method for relieving mental health symptoms . The majority of participants referenced taking walks as a form of stress relief : Going for walks and doing yoga . ( P62 ) I walk and also sit on a yoga ball and talk to the wall ( P94 ) A few participants emphasized the importance of walking " outside " ( P36 ) , suggesting that being in nature was a form of stress relief for our sample . To further illustrate the value of nature , P63 mentioned : I make sure that i get plenty of sunshine [ during ] the day . whether its a quick walk around the block or just sitting in the window with the sun on my face . it helps . CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Oguamanam et al . Other forms of physical activity that our participants utilized as forms of coping included “dancing” ( P35 , P54 , P96 ) , “yoga” ( P90 ) , and “boxing” ( P31 ) . Research confrms that physical activity is benefcial to the mental and emotional state of women during the prenatal and postpartum periods [ 54 ] . In line with the literature , several participants leveraged physical activity and body movement to help manage their mental health needs . 4 . 17 . 2 Social Support Strategies . Social support coping strategies are activities that involve seeking support from one’s extended network of family and friends [ 43 ] . Approximately 15 . 8 % of our participants ( N = 16 ) discussed their reliance on loved ones as a form of coping to alleviate stress . P80 stated : One way I relieve my stress is through talking with close family and friends . P78 also described her reliance on loved ones amidst challenges : I talk to my family members about my problems . Similarly , P46’s experience highlights the importance of having relatives to call on when she is in need of help , indicating that she : [ Asks ] close family members for a break , even a couple hours . A few participants referenced their reliance on conversations with their spouse as sources of coping . P78 stated : I talk to my husband or play video games . These examples illustrate how important it was for participants to be able to tap into their close - tie social networks amidst challeng - ing circumstances . In addition to engaging in conversations with loved ones , participants valued quality time with their ofspring to help with reducing stress . In addition to spending time with older children , participants specifcally discussed the value of interacting with their unborn and newborn children as a stress reliever . For example , P10 described how bonding with her unborn child allowed her to be more mindful : It slows me down and makes me take time bonding with my unborn child . Other participants described additional ways in which they draw stress relief from their babies , such as P12 , who said she focuses “on the future with my baby” , P75 , who said she simply focuses on “thinking of my baby” , and P43 who relieves stress by “rubbing my belly” . Each of these examples illustrates how , even amidst the stress that motherhood itself can bring on , young children can play a unique role in helping mothers manage their stress . In particular , participants spoke to the value of both cognitive engagement with their babies ( e . g . , thinking about them ) and direct physical connec - tion with them ( e . g . , through rubbing one’s stomach ) . They also spoke to both present - oriented engagement with their child ( e . g . , the immediate sensation of connecting with one’s child through rubbing of the womb ) and future - oriented engagement ( e . g . , con - sidering the future they have with their children ) . These varied interactions illustrate the multifaceted ways in which our partic - ipants sought to connect with their children as a form of stress relief . Across these examples , we see the various benefts our partic - ipants drew from their loved ones . Social support has been doc - umented as one of the most signifcant contributors to mental wellbeing in perinatal women . Specifcally , for Black women , so - cial support has been reported to be a central coping resource for mitigating the negative impacts of stress [ 97 , 100 , 112 ] . Hence , the use of social support coping strategies for mental health support amongst our study sample is consistent with the literature [ 36 ] . Interestingly , in addition to connecting with other adults in their networks , participants also discussed the value of connecting with their unborn and newly - born children – cognitively , emotionally , and physically – a unique opportunity in the perinatal period . 4 . 17 . 3 Religious & Spiritual - Based Strategies . Beyond connecting with others , our participants also discussed the importance of reli - gious and spiritual practices . Religious - and spiritual - based coping strategies refer to activities such as seeking assistance from a higher power , praying , or attending church . This type of faith - based cop - ing response has been cited as a primary strategy used to alleviate stress for many African American women [ 70 , 100 , 112 ] . However , such practices were reported less infrequently in our sample than other strategies discussed thus far . Our fndings show that 5 . 95 % of participants ( N = 6 ) relied on religious and spiritual - based practices to manage their stress . P5 described how her stress relief came from : Having faith and assurance in the Lord . A few participants discussed their use of spiritual strategies together with other active coping strategies in order to manage their mental health needs . P20 noted that she used “meditation and prayer” , while P55 cited “prayer and listening to music” as helping her manage stress . Describing her reliance on varying strategies for combating stress , P45 revealed that she uses the following strategies ( note that the authors have added commas in the following quote to support readability ) : Music , prayer , Bible reading , interacting with my other children’s , support from my family , arts and crafts , healthy snack . In summary , as recently discussed by O’Leary et al . [ 83 ] , spirituality and health are often closely intertwined , and thus it is important to investigate these dual concepts in the design of health promotion tools . While spiritual practices were discussed by a relatively small part of our sample , they were nonetheless important strategies for those participants . Our fndings thus highlight the importance of investigating to what extent faith and spirituality are an important element of mental health management amongst perinatal women . 4 . 17 . 4 Professional Help & Conventional Medicine Strategies . Thus far , we have described various strategies our participants used to manage their mental health . All of these strategies fall outside of for - mal healthcare settings . Interestingly and in contrast , just a few par - ticipants ( 5 . 94 % , N = 6 ) discussed the use of conventional medicine or seeking professional assistance from a healthcare provider . P59 commented that she takes medicine to alleviate stress : “I take zoloft prescribed by my doctor . ” Additionally , two participants cited speak - ing to a mental health professional as a coping technique : Therapy and tv ( P61 ) Talking to a counselor ( P100 ) The relatively small percentage of participants who relied on pro - fessional help / conventional medicine as a coping response to stress An Intersectional Look at Use of and Satisfaction with Digital Mental Health Platforms CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany is consistent with the literature that perinatal Black women un - derutilize professional health services for mental health support [ 72 ] . In summary , our participants took on active coping strategies , that is , direct measures to help alleviate and manage their maternal stressors . Their attempts to relieve stress involved a combination of activities that relied on self - care , social support , religion , spiri - tuality , and professional help . In the next section , we discuss the implications of both our quantitative and qualitative fndings for future work on digital mental health tools for perinatal wellbeing . 5 DISCUSSION As mentioned earlier in the paper , digital maternal health interven - tion research has typically taken a " one - size - fts - all " approach to design and has rarely included women from racial and ethnic mi - nority groups in studies . Our study not only specifcally examined practices and attitudes of perinatal Black women towards digital mental health resources , but also investigated the nuances and diferences amongst participants in our sample . One unique and pri - mary contribution of our work is that we conducted descriptive and ANOVA analsyses that questioned to what extent a population with commonalities in their cultural history—Black women—exhibits shared or varied patterns of digital mental health resource utiliza - tion and satisfaction . Our qualitative fndings further situate our quantitative results , revealing how our sample leveraged a range of holistic practices—that were primary outside of conventional medicine—to manage their mental health . Therefore , by ofering a nuanced look into the varied practices and attitudes of Black women , we challenge the notion that Black women are a monolith and consider the implications for future work that our fndings highlight . 5 . 1 Nuances in the Digital Maternal Mental Health Landscape Amongst Black Women Most of our participants ( 88 . 1 % ) reported using resources for mental health support , and all of these respondents indicated using at least one digital resource to address their mental health needs . These results suggests a prevalent use of digital mental health platforms amongst this population . The digital resources most used across our respondents were social media ( 52 . 5 % ) , apps ( 49 . 5 % ) , self - tracking devices ( 32 . 7 % ) , and video calls ( 31 . 7 % ) . These trends alone suggest opportunities for future work . Given that these were the most used resources , our fndings suggest that these resources may be more accessible or desirable amongst this population . Research is needed to investigate : ( a ) how each resource is used to support mental wellbeing , ( b ) expectations women have for these tools , ( c ) the particular benefts and challenges that they experience when using these platforms , and ( d ) the extent in which tools are used in concert or in isolation to address mental health concerns . Furthermore , our fndings conveyed the importance of going be - yond a bird’s eye analysis of resource use in this population and in - stead , understanding the nuances therein . When we drilled down to examine use across demographic groups , we found that women with higher income and educational attainment used apps for mental health support more frequently than lower - income respondents and those with less education . We also found that women who were cur - rently pregnant used video calls as a means of managing their men - tal health more frequently than postpartum women . Similarly , the frequency of self - tracking device use for mental health difered sig - nifcantly across income and education groups—participants with higher income and education levels reported using self - tracking devices more frequently . Research should examine the reasons be - hind these trends , for example , to what extent lower levels of use is associated with fewer opportunities or less time to engage with these resources . Moreover , researchers in this space should explore whether low usage is linked to whether tools have been designed to meet the particular needs and values of women with lower income and education . Identifying these explanations will be necessary to ensure equitable digital health innovation . When situated within prior work , our fndings align with re - search on Black women’s engagement with the broader digital landscape . The relatively high frequency of app use in our sample , for instance , resonates with research that suggests high acceptance of mobile app interventions amongst perinatal Black women and research showing that , overall , Black women have a high rate of smartphone ownership [ 74 ] . Similarly , our results conveyed comple - mentary fndings to prior work on attitudes towards digital mental health resources for Black women both outside and within the peri - natal context . In one case , a survey study amongst 102 Black women reported high acceptance ( i . e . , over 70 % ) of receiving mental health support through telehealth via video calls , and that acceptability varied across subgroups [ 72 ] . To provide a further example , our respondents’ high frequency of social media use for mental health support ( 52 . 5 % ) resonates with other work showing the acceptabil - ity of social media interventions in postpartum women [ 16 ] . For instance , in a clinical trial , Boyd et al . showed that a social media intervention for mental health management was positively received by more than 83 % of postpartum mothers with moderate levels of depressive symptoms [ 16 ] . Our fndings extend the critical body of literature centering Black women’s attitudes towards digital mental health interven - tions . However , one limitation within this research space is that comparative results of Black women’s utilization and satisfaction of digital mental health platforms across subgroups is scarce . Future work should compare utilization of and satisfaction with digital tools for supporting mental health amongst perinatal Black women , and Black women more broadly , to assess for variations across sub - groups and the specifc needs , preferences , and desires across these groups . 5 . 2 The Superwoman Schema : Opportunities for Scafolding Digital Mental Health Innovation & Inquiry Research has shown that Black women tend to endorse the super - woman role , which often results in presenting as self - contained , strong , resilient , and resisting vulnerability [ 35 ] . The SWS frame - work is one analytic tool that can scafold examinations of the nu - anced experiences and desires of Black women . Overall , we found that women were scoring moderate to high on the SWS scale across dimensions . Next , we discuss how our results ofer ways in which CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Oguamanam et al . this framework can specifcally guide digital mental health innova - tion and inquiry . First , we found women who were more likely to resist vulnera - bility ( one dimension of the SWS ) had a higher frequency of self - tracking device use . Self - tracking devices have been shown to be promising tools for supporting patient empowerment in allowing end - users to manage and help themselves [ 32 , 113 ] . One possible explanation for our fndings , then , is that women who were more likely to resist vulnerability were empowered to manage their men - tal health needs on their own via the self - tracking devices . Future work is needed to investigate this theorized explanation for the trends observed in our data . Nevertheless , self - tracking devices can serve as an alternative means of health management to inter - acting with healthcare providers . While these devices are not a replacement for formal healthcare , they may be a useful resource amongst Black populations who often mistrust and receive lower quality perinatal care as compared to White populations in the U . S . [ 45 , 69 , 76 ] . However , as we identify digital tools that can help perinatal Black women access care in new and innovative ways , we will also need complimentary work that aims to combat struc - tural barriers to wellbeing that systematically disenfranchise this population . Next , we also found that women who scored higher on the " in - tense motivation to succeed " construct of the SWS expressed higher levels of satisfaction with telehealth visits than women who scored lower on this construct . One possible explanation for these fndings is that women who felt a great drive to succeed ( e . g . , through goal setting and putting pressure on oneself to realize these goals ) might see the telehealth visit as a helpful way to achieve their own well - being goals . Research is needed to investigate these hypothesized mechanisms driving the trends in our data . To summarize , our fndings begin to show the value of the SWS for teasing apart attitudes , values , and characteristics that make up the superwoman role that may impact the utilization of digital mental health tools amongst perinatal Black women . Their choice to adopt or reject the superwoman role may serve as a coping re - sponse to the marginalization , oppression , and stress that they have experienced personally or vicariously witnessed in their loved ones , ancestors , or their broader cultural group . Identifying these perspec - tives can help to illuminate potential explanations for the varying orientation towards and experiences with digital health platforms . We encourage future work that further investigates the trends pre - sented here , to more deeply identify challenges and opportunities for digital mental health promotion in this demographic . In the remaining sections that follow , we provide three design considera - tions to inform future work on digital mental health interventions for marginalized populations . 5 . 3 Exploring Unconventional Therapeutic Approaches When approaching the creation of digital interventions for men - tal health support , designers should consider unconventional ap - proaches that are outside of conventional medicine , to supplement traditional methods [ 8 ] such as clinical screening tools . Through our qualitative analysis , we found that the our study sample utilized holistic practices for reducing mental health problems including engaging with music , relaxation and mindfulness strategies , phys - ical activity , and spirituality . Future research should investigate opportunities to design digital mental health interventions that support some of these more holistic strategies , in addition to more traditional features such as support for tracking and screening for mental health symptoms . Such investigations will help to shed light on perinatal Black women’s resource ecologies , and oppor - tunities for more holistic mental health support . Researchers in HCI have begun exploring the role of holistic practices such as mindfulness in the design of digital mental health interventions [ 63 , 109 , 121 ] . There is a specifc need to investigate to what extent such approaches are useful and engaging as - is for perinatal Black women and whether diferent approaches are needed . 5 . 4 Designing Mental Health Resource Ecologies We further recommend that future digital health research investi - gates the creation of technologies that enable perinatal women to curate and access mental health resource ecologies , that is , a collec - tion of digital resources that support their mental wellbeing . This recommendation is grounded in our fndings , along with prior work [ 74 ] , which convey Black women’s positive views towards a range of practices and digital technologies for mental health support . As such , future work should investigate the design of systems that enable women to create personalized collections of digital tools ( e . g . , accessible via a tailored dashboard ) that enable them to satisfy their multifaceted mental health needs . Our results show the promise of both social media and telehealth services for mental health promotion in perinatal Black women . First , social media was the most used digital resource for mental health support amongst our participants : just over half of our re - spondents said they use social media to address their mental health concerns . These fndings are supported by prior work , which has found that social media is widely used amongst pregnant and post - partum women [ 10 ] . Though social media has been reported to help foster community and provide emotional and social support for this demographic during a stressful period [ 14 ] , it can also serve as a space of harassment and trauma for Black women , detrimentally impacting their mental health and self - esteem [ 103 ] . Accordingly , it is crucial that researchers and designers neces - sitate care when developing social media interventions . Future research can explore how to integrate adaptive features of social networking modalities , for instance , into mental health interven - tions within this population , and account for potential barriers to such integration amongst postpartum women . For example , re - search is needed to understand to what extent postpartum women may enjoy accessing their support network via social media , but experience challenges in doing so , such as fnding the time amidst caring for a newborn . In such a scenario , tools that can facilitate the sharing of asynchronous video messages of support may be a valuable way for women to connect with others [ 115 ] . While existing smartphones enable video message sharing , future tools might help make it easier for postpartum women to signal their desire for support from their networks and to receive that support in video or other rich media formats . An Intersectional Look at Use of and Satisfaction with Digital Mental Health Platforms CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Next , we found that postpartum Black women reported higher satisfaction with telehealth than pregnant women . These fndings suggest that telehealth platforms may be more efectively designed to deliver care after , as opposed to before , pregnancy . Telehealth has proven to be benefcial in supporting perinatal wellbeing ( i . e . , remote monitoring , fewer clinical visit ) [ 1 , 106 , 111 ] . Future studies should explores ways to integrate the adaptive features of telehealth such as remote monitoring into interventions for support perinatal mental health promotion . Advances in remote fetal monitoring , for instance , may be one step towards delivering more comprehensive prenatal care [ 87 ] . In summary , our results suggest that social support via social me - dia and telehealth visits with healthcare providers such as doulas , midwives , and OB - GYNs may be particularly useful means of man - aging one’s mental health during the pregnancy period . There is much opportunity for future work to explore opportunities for digital mental health resource ecologies that leverage the unique strengths of varying digital resources into the design of interven - tions that support wellbeing in the pregnancy versus the postpar - tum periods . 5 . 5 Towards A Phenomenological Approach Lastly , we recommend that designers of digital mental health in - terventions consider an in - depth phenomenological [ 15 ] investi - gation of the lived - experiences of perinatal Black women to de - velop a better understanding of trends in use and satisfaction . Such an approach will help develop a nuanced understanding of Black women’s engagements with digital mental health resources in - formed by their own understandings . Future work should conduct more in - depth analyses of the thoughts and lived - experiences of perinatal Black women in mid - to high socioeconomic groups and those in lower socioeconomic groups . Our fndings suggest that accessible digital resources such as apps and self - tracking devices are not serving the needs of women who are of a lower socioeco - nomic status . First , we found that amongst women who were more educated and who had a higher income , there was a higher fre - quency of mobile app use for mental health support . Similarly , we found that self - tracking device usage increased with income level and educational attainment . Though prior work reports increased use of mobile apps in perinatal care [ 20 ] , our fndings indicate that this is not the case for all perinatal women . Researchers should conduct in - depth qualitative analyses that center the experiences of Black women across these demographic groups . Such work should , for example , seek to uncover : ( a ) which factors lead to increased and reduced utilization of digital mental health resources , ( b ) the ways in which use and non - use is enacted within women’s lives , ( c ) women’s perceptions of their experiences with the technology , and ( d ) how future tools can be better designed with features that are made more supportive of pregnant and postpartum Black women . 5 . 6 Limitations The primary limitation of our study is our relatively small sample size . Although prior work suggests that our target demographic is considered a “hard to reach population” , in depth conclusions cannot be drawn alone from one survey study . Additionally , there may be confounding variables that were not accounted for that have indirectly contributed to the trends revealed from our data . Nonetheless , because our fndings support and extend prior work on digital mental health interventions in the perinatal context , they serve as an important addition to the body of research in this space and highlight several important areas for further inquiry . Our study builds on work in HCI that encourages examinations of intersectional experiences of racial and ethnic minoritized groups [ 22 , 82 ] . We build on these recommendations by suggesting that , within the context of perinatal mental health interventions , it is critical for future work to explore diferences in utilization and adoption of digital health interventions amongst subgroups . Future work should investigate diferences that emerge in utilization when examining variables such as age , immigration status , multiracial identity , and geographic population density ( i . e . , rural vs . urban ) . 6 CONCLUSION In conclusion , as part of a larger mixed methods study , we con - ducted an online survey of 101 pregnant and postpartum Black women in the U . S . to investigate their utilization of digital mental health resources and tools . Our results highlight diferences in the way subgroups of this demographic utilize and perceive digital mental health platforms . Additionally , our fndings support prior work that rejects the “one size fts all” approach to designing men - tal health interventions for marginalized populations . Given that technology - based interventions are becoming more pervasive for supporting perinatal wellbeing , [ 33 ] , we urge future work in this space to investigate diferences in how subgroups of populations that are most at risk for poorer health outcomes , utilize , adopt , and perceive digital health tools . Our empirical study contributes design considerations for future work . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to thank the survey respondents , Dr .
