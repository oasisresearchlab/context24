P [ acman ] : A BAC Transgenic Platform for Targeted Insertion of Large DNA Fragments in D . melanogaster Koen J . T . Venken , 1 Yuchun He , 2 , 3 Roger A . Hoskins , 4 Hugo J . Bellen 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 * We describe a transgenesis platform for Drosophila melanogaster that integrates three recently developed technologies : a conditionally amplifiable bacterial artificial chromosome ( BAC ) , recombineering , and bacteriophage f C31 – mediated transgenesis . The BAC is maintained at low copy number , facilitating plasmid maintenance and recombineering , but is induced to high copy number for plasmid isolation . Recombineering allows gap repair and mutagenesis in bacteria . Gap repair efficiently retrieves DNA fragments up to 133 kilobases long from P1 or BAC clones . f C31 - mediated transgenesis integrates these large DNA fragments at specific sites in the genome , allowing the rescue of lethal mutations in the corresponding genes . This transgenesis platform should greatly facilitate structure / function analyses of most Drosophila genes . D rosophila is an important model orga - nism for studying biology and disease , and new tools are continually being de - veloped to facilitate this research ( 1 , 2 ) . A major advance was the development of P - element – mediated transformation after the injection of plasmids into Drosophila embryos ( 3 ) . Hence , P - element vectors have been engineered for numerous applications ( 4 ) . However , P - element­ – mediated transformation has a number of limi - tations : inability to clone large DNA fragments in available P - element vectors , difficulties in manipulating large DNA fragments , inability to transfer large DNA fragments into the fly genome , and failure to target DNA to specific sites in the genome . Cloning large DNA fragments in high – copy - number plasmids , such as typical P - element vectors , is inefficient because large fragments are unstable at high copy number in bacteria . Hence , low – copy - number vectors , including P1 ( 5 ) and bacterial artificial chromosome ( BAC ) ( 6 ) vectors , were developed to stably maintain large cloned DNA fragments . Unfortunately , low – copy - number vectors hamper sequencing , embryo injection , and other manipulations re - quiring large amounts of plasmid DNA . An elegant solution is a conditionally amplifiable plasmid that has two origins of replication ( ori ’ s ) : oriS for low - copy propagation , typical for P1 and BAC vectors ; and oriV , which can be experimentally induced to high copy number ( 7 ) . Hence , the introduction of conditionally amplifiable BAC features into fly transformation vectors is a first key step to manipulating large DNA fragments in Drosophila . Cloning of large DNA fragments is limited by conventional methods that rely on restriction enzymes and DNA ligases , hampering analyses of large genes and gene complexes . Recently , efficient in vivo cloning technologies using en - hanced and regulated recombination systems , commonly known as recombineering , have been developed ( 8 ) . Recombineering greatly facilitates the retrieval of DNA fragments through gap repair and their subsequent site - directed muta - genesis . Because recombineering is based on homologous recombination , restriction enzymes and DNA ligases are not required . Recom - bineering is widely used by mouse geneticists to generate transgenic and knockout constructs . Recombineering - mediated mutagenesis is much moreefficient withlow - copyplasmids ( 8 ) . Hence , using recombineering in a conditionally ampli - fiable BAC should greatly facilitate the gap repair of large DNA fragments and subsequent muta - genesis at low copy number . P - element – mediated transformation is lim - ited by DNA size , precluding the study of large genes ( > 40 kb ) and gene complexes . In addi - tion , more than 75 % of P elements insert in regulatory elements of genes ( 9 ) , often disrupt - ing genes in subtle ways ( 10 ) . Moreover , P ele - ments are subject to position effects : the effect of a local chromosomal environment on the lev - els or patterns of transgene expression . This necessitates the generation and characterization of several transgenes for each DNA construct studied . Hence , site - specific integration would greatly facilitate structure - function analysis of transgenes , permitting direct comparison of dif - ferently mutagenized DNA fragments integrated at the same site in the genome . Recently , site - specific integration using the integrase of bac - teriophage f C31 has been demonstrated in Drosophila ( 11 ) . f C31 - integrase mediates recom - bination between an engineered “ docking ” site , containing a phage attachment ( attP ) site , in the fly genome , and a bacterial attachment ( attB ) site in the injected plasmid . Three pseudo - attP docking sites were identified within the Dro - sophila genome , potentially bypassing desired integration events in engineered attP sites . For - tunately , they did not seem receptive to attB plasmids , because all integration events were at the desired attP sites ( 11 ) . Thus , recovery of large DNA fragments by gap repair into a low - copy plasmid containing an attB site , followed by f C31 - mediated transformation , might allow the integration of any DNA fragment into any en - gineered attP docking site dispersed throughout the fly genome . Here we describe new vectors that over - come the limitations associated with P - element – mediated transgenesis . We developed P / f C31 ar - tificial chromosome for manipulation ( P [ acman ] ) , a conditionally amplifiable BAC vector that con - tains recognition sites for both P - transposase – ( 3 ) and f C31 - mediated integration ( 11 ) . P [ acman ] permits recombineering - mediated cloning of any genomic DNA fragment from Drosophila P1 or BAC clones ( 12 – 15 ) and enables the transfer of large DNA fragments into the fly genome . The ability to easily manipulate these DNA frag - ments through recombineering and to introduce them into specific sites in the fly genome will greatly facilitate and accelerate in vivo genetic manipulations of Drosophila . Results Construction of a BAC transgenesis vector for Drosophila . The motivation to construct P [ acman ] grew from our inability to clone 29 - and 39 - kb DNA fragments in existing P - element vectors for the transformation rescue of muta - tionsinthegene senseless2 ( 16 ) . Wewereunable to identify restriction sites for cloning the entire gene . Moreover , recombineering - mediated gap repair in existing high - copy P - element vectors was unsuccessful . This was consistent with pub - lished data demonstrating that gap repair in high - copy or medium - copy plasmids has an upper size limit of 25 and 80 kb , respectively ( 17 ) . Because high - copy P elements have a substantial size , gap repair is limited to fragments of about 20 kb . We hypothesized that a low - copy plasmid might alleviate size limitations and improve the sta - bility of large DNA fragments . Hence , we added P - element components to a chloramphenicol - resistant conditionally amplifiable BAC ( 7 ) , resulting in P [ acman ] - Cm R ( Fig . 1A ) . The P - element components include the 5 ′ P and 3 ′ P termini required for P - transposase – mediated integration , a multiple cloning site ( MCS ) , and the white + marker . The conditionally ampli - fiable BAC contains two origins of replication : oriS and oriV ( 7 ) . oriS keeps P [ acman ] at low RESEARCH ARTICLE 1 Program in Developmental Biology , Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , TX 77030 , USA . 2 Department of MolecularandHumanGenetics , BaylorCollegeof Medicine , Houston , TX77030 , USA . 3 HowardHughesMedicalInstitute , Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , TX 77030 , USA . 4 Department of Genome Biology , Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , Berkeley , CA 94720 – 3200 , USA . 5 Department of Neuroscience , Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , TX 77030 , USA . * To whom correspondence should be addressed .

We created transgenic flies containing P [ acman ] - Cm R using P - transposase – mediated integration . To facilitate cloning by gap repair from a variety of sources , we also replaced the ampicillin - resistance marker into P [ acman ] - Cm R , resulting in P [ acman ] - Ap R . Both plasmids can be used to clone any DNA fragment from a variety of donor vectors . Recombineering - mediated gap repair into P [ acman ] . P [ acman ] was used to retrieve frag - ments by gap repair . For each gap repair , we designed four primer sets ( fig . S1 ) . Two ho - mology arms , located at either end of the DNA fragment , were cloned into P [ acman ] ( fig . 1B ) . Linearization between both homology arms and the subsequent transformation of the linearized construct into recombineering - competent bacteria containing the necessary genomic clone allow retrieval of the DNA fragment by gap repair . Gap repair was performed with the use of two similar strategies , relying on Red recombination functions ( fig . S2 ) ( 17 , 18 ) . Both strategies were used to retrieve DNA fragments ranging from 9 . 4 to 39 kb , from different donor plasmids ( Table 1 ) . Colony polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) screening identified correct recombination events at both junctions after gap repair . After plasmid copy - number induction , DNA fingerprinting and sequencing demonstrated that the desired frag - ment was obtained . Hence , the methodology is reliable and large DNA fragments can easily be retrieved . To test the functionality of the gap - repaired constructs , we used P - mediated transposition . Although germline transformation of the con - structs was efficient with small inserts , the efficiency dropped for fragments over 20 kb . Transgenic flies containing the gap - repaired fragments in P [ acman ] were crossed to flies carrying mutations in the corresponding genes . Eight out of 9 fragments tested fully rescued the lethality or visible phenotype associated with the mutations , in the homozygous or transheterozy - gous condition ( Table 1 ) . One fragment ( Sec8 - L ) did not rescue , although a smaller fragment en - compassing the same gene did . f C31 - mediated integration of P [ acman ] . Be - cause P - transposase – mediated transformation has size limitations , we explored the possibility of using f C31 - mediated integration to integrate larger constructs at specific sites within the ge - nome . To combine the power of recombineering with f C31 , we equipped P [ acman ] with an attB site , resulting in attB - P [ acman ] . To create ge - nomic attP docking sites , we introduced an attP site and yellow + into a minimal piggyBac trans - poson ( 19 ) ( piggyBac - yellow + - attP ) and inte - grated and remobilized this piggyBac in the Drosophila genome using piggyBac transposase . We isolated 34 homozygous viable insertions and determined their exact genomic location ( Fig . 2A and table S1 ) . Because piggyBa c has a more random distribution than P - transposase ( 9 ) , attB - P [ acman ] should integrate into both gene - poor and gene - rich regions . To integrate attB - P [ acman ] , we co - injected circular plasmid DNA and mRNA encoding f C31 - integrase ( 11 ) into embryos carrying piggyBac - yellow + - attP ( Fig . 2B ) . Integration results in flies with a “ yellow + ” body color and “ white + ” eye color phenotype . Because the attB site is upstream of the MCS and white + is downstream of the MCS , only transgenic flies that are “ yellow + white + ” should have undergone an integration event containing most of the injected DNA , including the cloned insert ( Fig . 2B ) . Hence , successful integration events can be genetically traced . Moreover , because both trans - posons ( P - element and piggyBac ) are maintained after integration , the inserted DNA can be re - mobilized using the respective transposases . We tested whether different attP docking sites are equally receptive to attB - P [ acman ] - Ap R . We focused on seven docking sites : two each on chromosomes X , 2 , and 3 , and one on chromosome 4 . As shown in table S2 , all but one of these docking sites were receptive , with similar integration efficiencies of 20 to 30 % . We occasionally obtained efficiencies as high as 60 % , similar to those in a previous report ( 11 ) . However , in general we observed higher sur - vival rates than Groth et al . ( 11 ) . In our hands , such efficiencies were higher than the P - transposase – mediated integration of similar - sized constructs . Because f C31 - mediated – integration is site - specific , only a single insertion is needed , and the injection procedure can therefore be scaled down to 50 embryos or less . Integration of attB - P [ acman ] - Ap R in the same docking site led to the same white + expression level ( fig . S3 ) . This is convenient , because rare events that were not integrated in the proper site exhibited a different eye color and were there - fore distinguished from true integration events . Integration of attB - P [ acman ] - Ap R in a single docking site on chromosome 2 consistently caused a patchy red eye phenotype ( fig . S3D ) , indicating position - effect variegation of white + Table 1 . Retrieval of genes in P [ acman ] .

Fig . 1 . P [ acman ] : BAC transgenesis for Drosophila . ( A ) P [ acman ] contains P - element transposase sites ( 3 ′ P and 5 ′ P ) , white + , and an MCS . This P element is inserted in the conditionally amplifiable BAC , containing a low - copy origin of replication ( oriS ) and a copy - inducible origin of replication ( oriV ) . ( B ) P [ acman ] is linearized between both homology arms ( LA and RA ) and transformed into recom - bineering bacteria containing P1 or BAC clones . Integration into the germ line of white – flies is mediated by P - element – mediated transformation . 15 DECEMBER 2006 VOL 314 SCIENCE www . sciencemag . org 1748 RESEARCH ARTICLE expression . This was not observed for the yellow + marker present at the same docking site . Moreover , the insertion of attB - P [ acman ] - Ap R into different docking sites resulted in different eye color phenotypes , indicating posi - tion effects on the expression level of the white + marker ( fig . S3 ) . The main difference between f C31 - and P - element – mediated integration is that position effects with the f C31 system are predictable , allowing for the selection of different but defined expression levels . To identify correct integration events , we developed PCR assays specific for the attP , attL ( left attachment ) , and attR ( right attachment ) sites ( Fig . 2C ) . Correct integration events were identified by the loss of the attP PCR product ( specific for the original docking site ) and the appearance of attL and attR PCR products ( specific for the integration event ) . PCR analysis indicated that all but one of the insertions was correctly integrated . Moreover , correct integra - tion events in homozygous viable docking sites maintained homozygous viability , demonstrating that the insertion does not detrimentally affect the local chromosomal environment . In numer - ous transformation experiments , in addition to proper integration events , we recovered only one event that converted a homozygous viable docking site into a recessive lethal locus . PCR analysis demonstrated that this event did not result in correct integration . Therefore , f C31 - mediated integration is very efficient . Cloning of large DNA fragments into attB - P [ acman ] . To clone large DNA fragments into attB - P [ acman ] - Ap R , we performed recombineer - ing - mediated gap repair , as described above . We retrieved fragments up to 102 kb in length from single P1 or BAC clones ( Table 2 ) . Multiple genes and gene complexes , including bancal , Dscam , teashirt , and the Bearded and Enhancer of Spl complexes , were cloned into attB - P [ acman ] - Ap R ( Table 2 ) . Unfortunately , some large genes were not contained within a single BAC ( 15 ) . We therefore decided to reconstitute large genes through serial gap repair from two overlapping BACclonesinto attB - P [ acman ] - Ap R : Instep1 , the smaller part is retrieved from one BAC , which is followed by step 2 , retrieving the remainder of the gene ( Fig . 3 and fig . S4 ) . This two - step procedure was successful in retrieving a 133 - kb fragment encompassing the Tenascin - major gene ( Table 2 ) . Fig . 2 .

To obtain transgenic flies with attB - P [ acman ] - Ap R constructs , we can use either P - transposase or f C31 - integrase . We first tested P - transposition for three small fragments . Transgenic animals were obtained for all three ( Table 2 ) . Because P - transposase – mediated in - tegration is inefficient for fragments larger than 20 kb , we switched to f C31 - mediated integra - tion . Several injection rounds suggested that the molar DNA concentration was critical . We em - pirically established that 75 ng of DNA per microliter of injection buffer ( ng / m l ) is the lower limit for attB - P [ acman ] - Ap R ( ~ 13 kb ) . There - fore , large ( 75 - to 135 - kb ) supercoiled plasmid DNA ( 300 to 750 ng / m l ) was co - injected with f C31 mRNA ( 250 to 500 ng / m l ) ( 11 ) . As shown in Table 2 , we obtained transgenic animals for most constructs , including 73 - , 76 - , 86 - , and 133 - kb fragments . In these cases , the transformation efficiency was about 10 % for medium ( 15 to 50 kb ) and 2 to 4 % for large plasmids ( > 50 kb ) . PCR analysis confirmed that all constructs in - tegrated correctly . For two transgenes , 18 and 102 kb in length , we did not obtain transfor - mants , illustrating that optimization for certain constructs might be required . Different gap - repaired fragments inserted in the same docking site differentially affected white + expression , suggesting that DNA context is important . Finally , multiple fragments fully rescued two independent lethal mutations , in the homozy - gous or transheterozygous condition , in each of the four corresponding genes or gene complexes tested ( Table 2 ) . These data show that gap repair permits the cloning of BAC - sized fragments , large transgenes can be integrated site - specifically in the Drosophila genome using f C31 , and mutations in essential genes and entire gene complexes can be rescued by large transgenic fragments . Discussion P [ acman ] provides numerous improvements when compared to current strategies for Drosoph - ila transgenesis . First , DNA constructs larger than 100 kb can be retrieved from genomic P1 and BAC clones using recombineering - mediated gap repair . Fragments are retrieved into a plasmid fitted with an inducible oriV replication origin that allows easy preparation of large quantities of DNA for sequencing and Drosophila transgen - esis . The retrieved fragments do not need to be resequenced because they are directly re - trieved from the genomic clone without PCR amplification . Second , unlike P - transposase , f C31 - integrase enables the integration of large fragments into the Drosophila genome . Because f C31 - integrase catalyzes recombination be - tween two ectopic attachment sites ( attB and attP ) , transgenes are integrated at specific dock - ing sites in the fly genome . This largely elim - inates the problem of position effects , a highly desirable feature when comparing different mutagenized constructs derived from the same transgene for structure / function analysis . Finally , site - directed mutagenesis via recombineering is much more efficient in low - copy plasmids such as P [ acman ] . We were able to clone fragments as large as 102 kb from single BACs . Only one report documents the gap repair of a similarly sized fragment from one BAC ( 20 ) . In both cases , gap repair was successful because of the use of a low - copy vector . Indeed , gap repair into high - copy or medium - copy plasmids has an upper size limit of 25 and 80 kb , respectively ( 17 ) . We also reconstituted one of the largest Drosophila genes , using serial gap repair , resulting in re - constitution of a 133 - kb fragment . One recent report demonstrated a variation of seamless re - combination of two large DNA fragments ( 20 ) . The methodology described here may facilitate the cloning of even larger genomic fragments into P [ acman ] , which may not be contained within single BAC clones in the genome tiling path set ( 15 ) . The numerous docking sites ( Fig . 2A and table S1 ) created in this work will have to be characterized in more detail to determine the expression levels of different genes that are in - serted in the same site . It will also be important to determine whether adjacent enhancers or reg - ulatory elements influence gene expression in each of the docking sites in order to identify sites that are as “ neutral ” as possible , a require - ment important for the study of regulatory ele - ments . The neighboring genome environment may also become important when overexpres - sion or RNA interference transgenes are in - serted . We feel that piggyBac - y + - attP insertions in intergenic regions may be the best candidates for these applications , although this will have to be determined experimentally . The circular f C31 bacteriophage genome is integrated into the linear genome of its host , Streptomyces lividans , by f C31 - integrase ( 21 ) . The genome of f C31 is about 41 . 5 kb , which is larger than standard high - copy plasmids . This fact suggested that f C31 - integrase would be useful to integrate circular DNA molecules up to 41 . 5 kb and potentially larger into the Dro - sophila genome . Indeed , we integrated fragments up to ~ 146 kb at defined sites in the genome , which was previously impossible . Large gap - repaired fragments should complement many molecularly defined deficiencies ( 22 ) , and sub - sequent mutagenesis should permit the analysis of genes within the deletion , obviating the need to recover mutations using conventional genetic screens or imprecise excision of mapped P elements . This approach also opens the road for clonal analysis of any gene that maps close to centromeric heterochromatin , because transgenic constructs for these genes can be recombined onto an FRT - containing chromosome . Finally , recombineering will allow the integration of any peptide or protein tag into the genomic rescue constructs to study protein localization and func - tion in vivo . The methodology proposed here opens up a wide variety of experimental manipulations that were previously difficult or impossible to per - form in Drosophila . Moreover , it is expected that it should be possible to adapt this methodology to other model organisms , because piggyBac transposes in many species , including mammals ( 23 ) , and f C31 is operational in many species , including mammalian cells ( 24 ) .

In step 2 , the construct is linearized between LA2 and RA2 , and the remaining segment of the gene is obtained from BAC 2 to reconstitute the entire gene . 15 DECEMBER 2006 VOL 314 SCIENCE www . sciencemag . org 1750 RESEARCH ARTICLE References and Notes 1 .

Trigo - Rodríguez 6 , 7 A long - debated issue concerning the nucleosynthesis of neutron - rich elements in asymptotic giant branch ( AGB ) stars is the identification of the neutron source . We report intermediate - mass ( 4 to 8 solar masses ) AGB stars in our Galaxy that are rubidium - rich as a result of overproduction of the long - lived radioactive isotope 87 Rb , as predicted theoretically 40 years ago . This finding represents direct observational evidence that the 22 Ne ( a , n ) 25 Mg reaction must be the dominant neutron source in these stars . These stars challenge our understanding of the late stages of the evolution of intermediate - mass stars and would have promoted a highly variable Rb / Sr environment in the early solar nebula . L ow - and intermediate - mass stars ( 1 to 8 solarmasses M ☉ ) evolvetowardtheasymp - totic giant branch ( AGB ) phase ( 1 ) after the completion of hydrogen and helium burn - ing in their cores , before they form planetary nebulae , ending their lives as white dwarfs . Basically , an AGB star is composed of an inert carbon - oxygen ( C - O ) core surrounded by a He - rich intershell and an extended H - rich convec - tive envelope . Nuclear energy release is domi - nated by the H shell and interrupted periodically by thermonuclear runaway He - shell “ thermal pulses ” that initiate a series of convective and other mixing events . Strong mass loss enriches the interstellar medium ( ISM ) with the products of the resulting complex nucleosynthesis ( 2 ) . During this thermally pulsing AGB ( TP - AGB ) phase , stars originally born O - rich ( reflecting the ISM composition ) can turn C - rich ( C / O > 1 ) as a consequence of the “ dredge - up ” of processed material from the bottom of the convective envelope to the stellar surface . In AGB stars at the higher end of this range ( 4 to 8 M ☉ ) , the convective envelope penetrates the H - burning shell , activating the so - called “ hot bottom burning ” ( HBB ) process ( 3 , 4 ) . HBB takes place when the temperature at the base of the convective envelope is hot enough ( T ≥ 2 × 10 7 K ) that 12 C can be converted into 13 C and 14 N through the CN cycle , so these AGBs are no longer C - rich and become again or remain O - rich despite the dredge - up . HBB models ( 3 , 4 ) also predict the production of the short - lived 7 Li isotope through the “ 7 Be transport mechanism ” ( 5 ) , which should be detectable at the stellar surface . The HBB activation in massive AGB stars is sup - ported by lithium overabundances in luminous O - rich AGB stars of the Magellanic Clouds ( 6 , 7 ) . In our own Galaxy , a small group of stars show - ing OH maser emission at 1612 MHz ( some - times without an optical counterpart but very bright in the infrared , the OH / IR stars ) has recently been found to show strong Li abun - dances ( 8 ) . Mixing of protons into the He - rich intershell during the TP - AGB phase leads to reaction chains producing free neutrons , which allow production of neutron - rich elements such as Rb , Sr , Y , Zr , Ba , La , Nd , and Tc by slow neutron capture on iron nuclei and other heavy elements ( the s process ) ( 9 – 11 ) . There are two possible chains for the neutron production : 13 C ( a , n ) 16 O and 22 Ne ( a , n ) 25 Mg . The 13 C neutron source op - erates at relatively low neutron densities ( N n < 10 7 cm – 3 ) and temperatures T < 0 . 9 × 10 8 K ( 11 , 12 ) in TP - AGB stars during the interpulse period . The 22 Ne neutron source operates at much higher neutron densities ( N n > 10 10 cm – 3 ) and requires higher temperatures ( T > 3 . 0 × 10 8 K ) , which are achieved only while the convective thermal pulse is ongoing . In the more massive AGB stars ( > 4 to 5 M ☉ ) , where these high temperatures are more easily achieved , the s - process elements are expected to form mainly through the 22 Ne ( a , n ) 25 Mg reaction ( 11 , 13 ) . The 22 Ne neutron source also strongly favors the production of the stable isotope 87 Rb because of the operation of a branching in the s - process path at 85 Kr ( 14 ) that modifies the isotopic mix between 85 Rb and 87 Rb ( 14 – 17 ) . Unfortunately , the Rb isotope ratio cannot be measured in stellar sources ( 17 ) even with the help of very - 1 ISO Data Centre , European Space Astronomy Centre , Re - search and Scientific Support Department , European Space Agency , Villafranca del Castillo , Apdo . 50727 , E - 28080 Madrid , Spain . 2 Herschel Science Centre , European Space Astronomy Centre , Research and Scientific Support Depart - ment , European Space Agency , Villafranca del Castillo , Apdo . 50727 , E - 28080 Madrid , Spain . 3 Groupe de Recherches en Astronomie et Astrophysique du Languedoc , UMR 5024 , Université de Montpellier 2 , F - 34095 Montpellier Cedex 5 , France . 4 INAF – Osservatorio Astronomico di Roma , via Frascati 33 , I - 00040 MontePorzio Catone , Italy . 5 Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias and Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas , La Laguna , E - 38200 Tenerife , Spain . 6 Institute of Space Sciences and Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas , Campus UAB , Facultat de Ciències , Torre C - 5 , parells , 2 a planta , 08193 Bellaterra , Barcelona , Spain . 7 Institut d ’ Estudis Espacials de Catalunya , Ed .
