Here , we identify a putative host cell receptor for MCPyV . We found that recombinant MCPyV VP1 pentameric capsomeres both hemagglutinated sheep red blood cells and interacted with ganglioside GT1b in a sucrose gradient ﬂotation assay . Structural differences between the analyzed gangliosides suggest that MCPyV VP1 likely interacts with sialic acids on both branches of the GT1b carbohydrate chain . Identiﬁcation of a potential host cell receptor for MCPyV will aid in the elucidation of its entry mechanism and pathophysiology . Members of the polyomavirus ( PyV ) family , including sim - ian virus 40 ( SV40 ) , murine PyV ( mPyV ) , and BK virus ( BKV ) , bind cell surface gangliosides to initiate infection ( 2 , 8 , 11 , 15 ) . PyV capsids are assembled from 72 pentamers ( cap - someres ) of the major coat protein VP1 , with the internal proteins VP2 and VP3 buried within the capsids ( 7 , 12 ) . The VP1 pentamer makes direct contact with the carbohydrate portion of the ganglioside ( 10 , 12 , 13 ) and dictates the speci - ﬁcity of virus interaction with the cell . Gangliosides are glyco - lipids that contain a ceramide domain inserted into the plasma membrane and a carbohydrate domain that directly binds the virus . Speciﬁcally , SV40 binds to ganglioside GM1 ( 2 , 10 , 15 ) , mPyV binds to gangliosides GD1a and GT1b ( 11 , 15 ) , and BKV binds to gangliosides GD1b and GT1b ( 8 ) . Recently , a new human PyV designated Merkel cell PyV ( MCPyV ) was identiﬁed in Merkel cell carcinomas , a rare but aggressive skin cancer of neuroendocrine origin ( 3 ) . It is as yet unclear whether MCPyV is the causative agent of Merkel cell carcinomas ( 17 ) . A key to understanding the infectious and transforming properties of MCPyV is the elucidation of its cellular entry pathway . In this study , we identify a putative host cell receptor for MCPyV . Because an intact infectious MCPyV has not yet been iso - lated , we generated recombinant MCPyV VP1 pentamers in order to characterize cellular factors that bind to MCPyV . VP1 capsomeres have been previously shown to be equivalent to virus with respect to hemagglutination properties ( 4 , 16 ) , and the atomic structure of VP1 bound to sialyllactose has dem - onstrated that the capsomere is sufﬁcient for this interaction ( 12 , 13 ) . The MCPyV VP1 protein ( strain w162 ) was expressed and puriﬁed as described previously ( 1 , 6 ) . Brieﬂy , a glutathi - one S - transferase - MCPyV VP1 fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and puriﬁed using glutathione - Sepharose af - ﬁnity chromatography . The fusion protein was eluted using glutathione and cleaved in solution with thrombin . The throm - bin - cleaved sample was then rechromatographed on a second glutathione - Sepharose column to remove glutathione trans - ferase and any uncleaved protein . The unbound VP1 was then chromatographed on a P - 11 phosphocellulose column , and peak fractions eluting between 400 and 450 mM NaCl were collected . The puriﬁed protein was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) , fol - lowed by Coomassie blue staining ( Fig . 1A , left ) and immuno - blotting using an antibody ( I58 ) that generally recognizes PyV VP1 proteins ( Fig . 1A , right ) ( 9 ) . Transmission electron mi - croscopy ( Philips CM10 ) analysis conﬁrmed that the puriﬁed recombinant MCPyV VP1 formed pentamers ( capsomeres ) , which did not assemble further into virus - like particles ( Fig . 1B ) . In an initial screening of its cell binding properties , we tested whether the MCPyV VP1 pentamers hemagglutinated red blood cells ( RBCs ) . The MCPyV VP1 pentamers were incubated with sheep RBCs and assayed as previously de - scribed ( 5 ) . SV40 and mPyV recombinant VP1 pentamers served as negative and positive controls , respectively . We found that MCPyV VP1 hemagglutinated the RBCs with the same efﬁciency as mPyV VP1 ( protein concentration / hemag - glutination unit ) ( Fig . 1C , compare rows B and C from wells 1 to 11 ) , suggesting that MCPyV VP1 engages a plasma mem - brane receptor on the RBCs . The recombinant murine VP1 protein used for comparison was from the RA strain , a small plaque virus ( 4 ) . Thus , MCPyV VP1 has the hemagglutination characteristics of a small plaque mPyV ( 12 , 13 ) . To characterize the chemical nature of the putative receptor for MCPyV , total membranes from RBCs were puriﬁed as described previously ( 15 ) . The plasma membranes ( 30 (cid:2) g ) were incubated with MCPyV VP1 ( 0 . 5 (cid:2) g ) and ﬂoated on a discontinuous sucrose gradient ( 15 ) . After fractionation , the samples were analyzed by SDS - PAGE , followed by immuno - blotting with I58 . VP1 was found in the bottom of the gradient * Corresponding author . Mailing address for R .

In the presence of plasma membranes , a fraction of the VP1 ﬂoated to the middle of the gradient ( Fig . 2A , second panel ) , supporting the hemagglutination results that suggested that MCPyV VP1 binds to a receptor on the plasma membrane . To determine whether the receptor is a protein or a lipid , plasma membrane preparations ( 30 (cid:2) g ) were incubated with proteinase K ( Sigma ) , followed by analysis with SDS - PAGE and Coomassie blue staining . Under these conditions , the ma - jority of the proteins in the plasma membranes were degraded by the protease ( Fig . 2B , compare lanes 1 and 2 ) . Despite the lack of proteins , the proteinase K - treated plasma membranes bound MCPyV VP1 as efﬁciently as control plasma mem - branes ( Fig . 2A , compare the second and third panels ) , dem - onstrating that MCPyV VP1 interacts with a protease - resistant receptor . The absence of VP1 in the bottom fraction in Fig . 2A ( third panel ) is consistent with the fact that the buoyant density of the membranes is lowered by proteolysis . Of note , a similar result was seen with binding of the mPyV to the plasma mem - brane ( 15 ) . Binding of MCPyV to the cell surface of two human tissue culture cells ( i . e . , HeLa and 293T ) was also largely unaffected by pretreatment of the cells with proteinase K ( Fig . 2C and D , compare lanes 1 and 2 ) , further indicating that a nonproteinaceous molecule on the plasma membrane engages the virus . We next determined whether the protease - resistant receptor contains a sialic acid modiﬁcation . Plasma membranes ( 10 (cid:2) g ) were incubated with a neuraminidase ( (cid:3) 2 - 3 , 6 , 8 neuraminidase ; Calbiochem ) to remove the sialic acid groups . In contrast to the control plasma membranes , the neuraminidase - treated membranes did not bind MCPyV VP1 ( Fig . 2E , compare ﬁrst and second panels ) , indicating that the MCPyV receptor in - cludes a sialic acid modiﬁcation . Gangliosides are lipids that contain sialic acid modiﬁcations . We asked if MCPyV VP1 binds to gangliosides similar to other PyV family members . The structures of the gangliosides used in this analysis ( gangliosides GM1 , GD1a , GD1b , and GT1b ) are depicted in Fig . 3A . To assess a possible ganglioside - VP1 interaction , we employed a liposome ﬂotation assay estab - lished previously ( 15 ) . When liposomes ( consisting of phos - phatidyl - choline [ 19 (cid:2) l of 10 mg / ml ] , - ethanolamine [ 5 (cid:2) l of 10 mg / ml ] , - serine [ 1 (cid:2) l of 10 mg / ml ] , and - inositol [ 3 (cid:2) l of 10 mg / ml ] ) were incubated with MCPyV VP1 and subjected to the sucrose ﬂotation assay , the VP1 remained in the bottom frac - tion ( Fig . 3B , ﬁrst panel ) , indicating that VP1 does not interact with these phospholipids . However , when liposomes contain - ing GT1b ( 1 (cid:2) l of 1 mM ) , but not GM1 ( 1 (cid:2) l of 1 mM ) or GD1a ( 1 (cid:2) l of 1 mM ) , were incubated with MCPyV VP1 , the vesicles bound this VP1 ( Fig . 3B ) .

Importantly , MCPyV binds less efﬁciently to neura - minidase - treated GT1b - containing liposomes than to GT1b - containing liposomes ( Fig . 3B , sixth panel ) , suggesting that the GT1b sialic acids are involved in virus binding . This ﬁnding is consistent with the ability of neuraminidase to block MCPyV binding to the plasma membrane ( Fig . 2E ) . The level of virus ﬂotation observed in the neuraminidase - treated GT1b - con - taining liposomes is likely due to the inefﬁciency of the neur - aminidase reaction with a high concentration of GT1b used to prepare the vesicles . As controls , GM1 - containing liposomes bound SV40 ( Fig . 3C ) , GD1a - containing liposomes bound mPyV ( Fig . 3D ) , and GD1b - containing liposomes bound BKV ( Fig . 3E ) , demon - strating that the liposomes were functionally intact . We note that , while all of the MCPyV VP1 ﬂoated when incubated with liposomes containing GT1b ( Fig . 3B , sixth panel ) , a signiﬁcant fraction of SV40 , mPyV , and BKV VP1 remained in the bot - tom fraction despite being incubated with liposomes contain - ing their respective ganglioside receptors ( Fig . 3C to E , second panels ) . This result is likely due to the fact that in contrast to MCPyV , which are assembled as pentamers ( Fig . 1B ) , the SV40 , mPyV , and BKV used in these experiments are fully assembled particles : their larger and denser nature prevents efﬁcient ﬂotation . Nonetheless , we conclude that MCPyV VP1 binds to ganglioside GT1b efﬁciently . The observation that GD1a does not bind to MCPyV VP1 suggests that the monosialic acid modiﬁcation on the right branch of GT1b ( Fig . 3A ) is insufﬁcient for binding . Similarly , the failure of GD1b to bind MCPyV VP1 suggests that the sialic acid on the left arm of GT1b is necessary for binding . Together , these observations suggest that MCPyV VP1 inter - acts with sialic acids on both branches of GT1b ( Fig . 4 ) . A recent structure of SV40 VP1 in complex with the sugar por - tion of GM1 ( 10 ) demonstrated that although SV40 VP1 binds both branches of GM1 ( Fig . 4 ) , only a single sialic acid in GM1 is involved in this interaction . In the case of mPyV , structures of mPyV VP1 in complex with different carbohydrates ( 12 , 13 ) revealed that the sialic acid - galactose moiety on the left branch of GD1a ( and GT1b ) is sufﬁcient for mPyV VP1 binding ( Fig .

( A ) Puriﬁed recombinant MCPyV VP1 was incubated with or without the indicated plasma membranes .

Although no structure of BKV in complex with the sugar portion of GD1b ( or GT1b ) is available , in vitro binding stud - ies ( 8 ) have suggested that the disialic acid modiﬁcation on the right branch of GD1b ( and GT1b ) is responsible for binding BKV VP1 ( Fig . 4 ) . Thus , it appears that the unique feature of the MCPyV VP1 - GT1b interaction is that the sialic acids on both branches of this ganglioside are likely involved in capsid binding . The identiﬁcation of a potential cellular receptor for MCPyV will facilitate the study of its entry mechanism . An important issue for further study is to determine whether MCPyV targets Merkel cells preferentially , and if so , whether GT1b is found in higher levels in these cells to increase sus - ceptibility .
