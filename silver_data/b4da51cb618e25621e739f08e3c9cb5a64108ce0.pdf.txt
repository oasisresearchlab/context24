Data from the following three areas of the brainstorming literature are synthe - sized to assess diﬀerences across performance variables and group member satisfaction : ( 1 ) elec - tronic brainstorming ( EBS ) groups versus traditional face - to - face ( FTF ) interacting groups , ( 2 ) EBS groups versus nominal groups , and ( 3 ) EBS versus electronic nominal ( e - nominal ) groups . The results of thisintegration show that EBS groups are more productive and more satisﬁed with theinteractionprocess thanFTFgroups . Additionally , largeEBSgroupsoutperformed nominal groups , whereas small nominal groups outperformed EBS groups . These ﬁndings have important implications for electronic collaboration and teamwork in both academic and orga - nizational settings , especially given the recent proliferation of virtual teamwork .

Introduction Producing creative solutions to problems is an important outcome variable asso - ciated with group interactions in the workplace ( Kerr & Tindale , 2004 ; Vissers & Dankbaar , 2002 ) . Using groups to facilitate creative idea generation has intuitive ap - peal , because it is widely believed that groups are superior to unaided individuals in such tasks ( Faure , 2004 ; Gallupe , Cooper , Grise´ , & Bastianutti , 1994 ; Valacich , Den - nis , & Connolly , 1994 ) . Popularizing this notion , Osborn ( 1957 ) formulated speciﬁc procedures for interacting groups working on creative idea generation tasks , a pro - cess dubbed ‘‘group brainstorming . ’’ Group brainstorming is widely used in a variety of settings and derivations of this technique are commonplace in organizations . In brainstorming , participants are encouraged to voice or record as many ideas as pos - sible , regardless of the practicality or feasibility of the ideas . Participants are also encouraged to build upon other members (cid:2) ideas ( Connolly , Routhieaux , & Schnei - der , 1993 ; Paulus , Larey , & Ortega , 1995 ) . According to Osborn , brainstorming groups could be expected to outperform individuals in terms of both the quantity and quality of ideas . However , numerous empirical studies have disconﬁrmed these assertions ( see Kerr & Tindale , 2004 for a review ) . In traditional laboratory and ﬁeld studies of group brainstorming , face - to - face ( hereafter , FTF ) groups of various sizes are compared to nominal groups , which are formed by aggregating the output of a comparable number of individuals work - ing separately . The outcome in nearly all such studies is that nominal groups outper - form FTF groups in terms of the production of non - redundant ideas and idea quality ( Diehl & Stroebe , 1987 ) . Mullen , Johnson , and Salas ( 1991 ) conducted a meta - analysis comparing FTF groups and nominal groups from 1958 to 1990 , and found the mean eﬀect sizes from the experimental literature to be large ( r = . 57 for the number of non - redundant ideas ; r = . 56 for idea quality ) . These results con - tradict the popular , but poorly substantiated notion that communication among individuals will result in ‘‘synergistic’’ eﬀects ( Faure , 2004 ; Pinsonneault , Barkhi , Gallupe , & Hoppen , 1999a ; Tindale & Larson , 1992 ) . In light of these consistent ﬁndings , considerable attention has been paid to elec - tronic brainstorming ( EBS ) , an e - collaboration method that employs networked computer terminals and software designed to allow group members to communicate electronically during idea generation exercises ( Connolly et al . , 1993 ; Dennis & Valacich , 1994 ) . The technology and procedure of electronic group brainstorming are thoroughly described elsewhere ( Dennis & Valacich , 1993 , 1999 ; Dennis & Wil - liams , 2003 ; Pinsonneault et al . , 1999a ) , but we shall brieﬂy summarize the process . Participants are presented with a textual description of the brainstorming task on their computer monitors , and when they generate an idea , they simply type it in a designated portion of the screen . Once an idea is entered it becomes available for viewing by other group members in a shared space that appears in a section on the monitor in each workstation . This shared space is also referred to as group memory ( Dennis & Valacich , 1993 ) . In some instances , the group space shows all of the cumulative ideas for the session , while a random subset of ideas is displayed in others ( Pinsonneault et al . , 1999a ) . Input from each participant is synchronously 1550 D . M . DeRosa et al . / Computers in Human Behavior 23 ( 2007 ) 1549 – 1581
