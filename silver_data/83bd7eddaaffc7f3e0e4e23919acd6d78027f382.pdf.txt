Abstract 29 Introduction : Understanding human mixing patterns relevant to infectious diseases spread 30 through close contact is vital for modelling transmission dynamics and optimisation of 31 disease control strategies . Mixing patterns in low - income countries like Malawi are not well 32 understood . 33 34 Methodology : We conducted a social mixing survey in urban Blantyre , Malawi between 35 April and July 2021 ( between the 2nd and 3rd wave of COVID - 19 infections ) . Participants 36 living in densely - populated neighbourhoods were randomly sampled and , if they consented , 37 reported their physical and non - physical contacts within and outside homes lasting at least 5 38 minutes during the previous day . Age - specific mixing rates were calculated , and a negative 39 binomial mixed effects model was used to estimate determinants of contact behaviour . 40 41 Results : Of 1 , 201 individuals enrolled , 702 ( 58 . 5 % ) were female , the median age was 15 42 years ( interquartile range [ IQR ] 5 - 32 ) and 127 ( 10 . 6 % ) were HIV - positive . On average , 43 participants reported 10 . 3 contacts per day ( range : 1 - 25 ) . Mixing patterns were highly age - 44 assortative , particularly those within the community and with skin - to - skin contact . Adults 45 aged 20 - 49y reported the most contacts ( median : 11 , IQR : 8 - 15 ) of all age groups ; 38 % 46 ( 95 % CI : 16 - 63 ) more than infants ( median : 8 , IQR : 5 - 10 ) , who had the least contacts . 47 Household contact frequency increased by 3 % ( 95 % CI 2 - 5 ) per additional household 48 member . Unemployed participants had 15 % ( 95 % CI : 9 - 21 ) fewer contacts than other adults . 49 Among long range ( > 30 meters away from home ) contacts , secondary school children had 50 the largest median contact distance from home ( 257m , IQR 78 - 761 ) . HIV - positive status in 51 adults > 18 years - old was not associated with increased contact patterns ( 1 % , 95 % CI - 9 - 12 ) . 52 During this period of relatively low COVID - 19 incidence in Malawi , 301 ( 25 . 1 % ) individuals 53 stated that they had limited their contact with others due to COVID - 19 precautions ; however , 54 their reported contacts were not fewer ( 8 % , 95 % CI 1 - 13 ) . 55 56 .

This highlights the limits of contact - 59 restriction - based mitigation strategies in such settings and the need for pandemic 60 preparedness to better understand how contact reductions can be enabled and motivated . 61 62 Keywords : Social contacts , Transmission , Mixing data , Infectious disease , Malawi , Africa 63 64 Introduction 65 Globally , respiratory tract pathogens carry a substantial burden of morbidity and mortality at 66 all ages 1 – 3 , with incidence highest in low - and middle - income countries and in populations 67 where human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) prevalence is high . For instance , an estimated 68 318 , 000 pneumococcal deaths occured in 2015 of which 23 , 300 were among HIV - positive 69 individuals 1 . In 2019 , there were an estimated 1 . 5 million deaths from tuberculosis ( TB ) , with 70 HIV a major risk factor for the development of active TB and mortality 2 . By November 2021 , 71 5 . 2 million deaths from Coronavirus disease ( COVID - 19 ) have been reported globally 4 , and 72 with detrimental impact on heathcare delivery , particularly in low - income countries ( LICs ) 5 . 73 74 Transmission of respiratory tract pathogens requires close contact with infectious respiratory 75 droplets , secretions or inhalation , making understanding of human social mixing patterns an 76 essential part of the design of effective disease control strategies 6 . Social contact type , 77 frequency , duration and place have shown to vary substantially between different settings 7 , 8 . 78 Local built environment , population characteristics , and social activities such as traditional , 79 political , religious and leisure events are likely to play important roles in explaining contact 80 patterns variations between countries 9 – 11 . However , relatively little is known about social 81 mixing patterns in LICs 8 , including how these are affected by age , occupation , household 82 size , HIV status , and non - pharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ) during COVID - 19 pandemic . 83 84 .

Intergenerational mixing between younger children 88 and adults was evident in Zimbabwe , reflecting parental or guardian roles played by adults 89 13 , though age - sex mixing patterns are not well knowm 12 , 13 . Commonly , people tend to make 90 high number of contacts within a short distance of their homes , with this being most 91 pronounced for people living close to their usual place of work 9 , 15 . Where commuting long 92 distances to work is common through mass transport , outbreak containment becomes more 93 difficult due to greater ease of wide spatial spread of respiratory infections 16 . 94 95 Physical distancing and lockdown NPIs to limit the number and geographical spread of close 96 contacts have been used extensively during the COVID - 19 pandemic , especially in HICs 97 and MICs where relatively ; mobility is usually high , per capita hospitalisation and mortality 98 during the first wave was high , and lockdowns were strictly observed 17 – 20 . In LICs , the 99 impact of NPIs on social contacts is less clear , with added uncertainty on whether individual 100 contacts are affected by COVID - 19 vaccination status due to perceived attitude of being 101 protected from severe COVID - 19 21 . However , this is unlikely due to relatively very low 102 current COVID - 19 vaccination coverage in LICs 22 . 103 104 Unlike in HICs , urban neighbourhoods in LICs are predominantly comprised of high - density 105 informal settlements , relatively larger households ( extended families ) , have low rates of 106 formal employment , and often high HIV prevalence 23 , 24 . Contact patterns may then differ 107 substantially having , for example , much higher rates within than outside households , and a 108 higher ratio of skin - to - skin to verbal contacts 7 , 13 . Despite these anticipated differences , very 109 few mixing studies are from Africa 9 , 10 , 13 , 14 , 17 , 25 , 26 , and with only three from LICs 12 – 14 . Also , 110 understanding how contact patterns vary by HIV status is important to inform targeted 111 interventions to mitigate risks both to HIV - poisitive individuals and to their social contacts . 112 .

Ndirande mainly comprises high - density informal residential neighbourhoods , 124 with minimal town - planning , building regulations or access to municipal services such as 125 roads , electricity , water or refuse collection . Buildings tend to be single storey , built by 126 unqualified local artisans using low - cost and sometimes locally - made materials like fired 127 bricks . The road network is extremely limited , making access by motor vehicle impassable 128 for most parts of the suburb . 129 130 Our sampling frame was based - on a previous Blantyre household TB prevalence survey , 131 conducted in 2018 - 2019 , where adult HIV status was ascertained using Government - 132 approved rapid diagnostic tests 27 . The TB prevalence survey mapped high density 133 neighbourhoods in Blantyre city into 72 clusters where 12 , 865 adults from randomly selected 134 households were recruited proportion to cluster size . Ndirande , the site for the present 135 social mixing study , contributed 14 clusters and 2 , 626 adults to the TB prevalence survey . 136 137 The targeted sample size for the present social mixing study was  1 , 080 participants from 138 393 households across 14 clusters , of whom 490 were adults aged  18 years - old ( y ) , and 139 .

A randomly sample ( proportional to cluster size ) of 140 household members from Ndirande clusters of TB prevalence survey was taken , aiming to 141 recruit equal number of participants across six age groups of < 1y ( infants ) , 1 - 4y ( preschool 142 children ) , 5 - 14y ( primary school children ) , 15 - 19y ( secondary school children ) , 20 - 49y 143 ( adults ) , and 50 + y ( older adults ) to give adequate power of  80 % to measure the number of 144 social contacts with standard deviation of no more than 50 % of the mean number of daily 145 social contacts , and to detect the true differences in the mean contact rates between age 146 groups if in excess of 30 % 10 , 28 . Age groups were chosen based on transmission patterns of 147 a typical respiratory infection 7 , 12 , 29 . 148 149 A household was defined as a group of family members or unrelated individuals living in the 150 same compound and sharing food from the same kitchen 30 . Household size was split into 151 < 4 , 4 - 6 , > 6 members during analysis based on interquantile range of measured household 152 size in the study . Using the sampling frame of households in the 14 Ndirande clusters , 153 handheld geographical positioning system ( GPS , Garmin ETrex 30 ) devices were used to 154 identify previously enrolled households . After visiting and validating each household , the 155 household head aged  18 years was invited to participate , along with their < 18 years - old 156 household members . If a household or an adult household member who participated in the 157 TB prevalence survey was not found after two visits , they were replaced by next household 158 on the list . If a particular age - group had reached it’s required sample size , recruitment was 159 restricted to households with at least one member in the age - groups that had not reached 160 saturation . 161 162 COVID - 19 dynamics during field study 163 To date , Malawi has experienced three COVID - 19 waves ( May to August 2020 , January to 164 March 2021 , and June to September 2021 ) 31 . Our social mixing study was conducted after 165 the end of the second wave ( April - May 2021 ) and during the first half of the third wave 166 .

During our study period , Malawi had initially implemented Level 1 COVID - 167 19 policies , which included social distancing , recommended face mask wearing , rotational 168 working , limited transit vehicles , self - quarantine for returning travellers , and resctrictions of 169 gatherings to100 people ( From April - May 2021 ) . From June - July 2021 , Level 3 COVID - 19 170 policies were enacted , including : restricted movements , enforced facemask wearing , closing 171 of non - essential businesses , enforced social distancing , reduced public transportation 172 capacity , and 10 people restricted gatherings . Throughout the study period between April 173 and July 2021 , school closures were not implemented . 174 175 Data collection 176 The study outcomes were reported physical ( participant’s skin to skin touch with a contact ) 177 and non - physical contacts ( participant’s two - way close verbal conversation lasting for  5 178 minutes and with  3 words exchanged with a contact ) during the time period between 179 waking up in the morning and going to bed in the evening 10 . The household head was 180 interviewed on household characteristics and composition on behalf of other household 181 members , and also responded to their own individual demographic characteristics , travel 182 history , COVID - 19 behavioural change , and social mixing events , and those of younger ( < 7 183 years - old ) household members . Older children mostly reported their contacts with help of an 184 adult . A house was considered well - ventilated if it had open windows , doors and ventilation 185 within the cooking area ( Supplementary Questionnaire ) . 186 187 Survey interviews were conducted across all days of the week to ensure representation of 188 weekdays and weekends . Repeated contacts with the same individual were recorded once , 189 noting the frequency and cumulative time . Open data kit ( ODK , Nafundi , Seattle , USA ) was 190 used to capture participant’s responses electronically , with an embedded electronic physical 191 address locator ( ePAL , Tripod Software , Salford , UK ) for geolocating places of contacts 24 . 192 193 .

The number and proportion of physical 197 and non - physical contact events were also tabulated by contact duration , frequency , 198 location , relationship of participant to contact , and sex of contact . 199 200 Social contact patterns were characterised by computing the mean number of contact 201 events for a set of potential factors ( age , sex , occupation , education , HIV , day of the week , 202 COVID - 19 restriction , and household size ) , with bootstrap confidence intervals based on 203 1000 bootstrap replicates . Factors associated with the mean number of mixing events at 204 p < 0 . 10 in univariable analysis were retained in multivariable analysis if they reduced the 205 Akaike Information Criterion ( AIC ) 32 . To investigate factors associated with contact rates , a 206 negative binomial mixed model with household random intercept terms was constructed , and 207 the ratio of the mean number of contact events in each category of the factor relative to the 208 reference category was calculated 10 . 209 210 Age - specific social mixing rates 211 Age - stratified contact matrices were generated to investigate interactions between age 212 groups . Age - specific contact rates through contact matrices were constructed from the mean 213 number of daily contacts between participants and their contacts using the ‘socialmixr’ R 214 package 33 . Age - based contact matrices were estimated based on the ratio of the measured 215 probability of a contact event between individuals based on age group to a null model of the 216 probability of that contact event under an assumption of random mixing . Contact 217 probabilities under the null model were determined by proportion of the population in each 218 given age category in Ndirande 24 , 30 . Our analyses were weighted by days of the week as 219 well as reciprocity in contact patterns such that the total number of contacts from age group 𝑖 220 to 𝑗 were equal to the total number of contacts from age group 𝑗 to 𝑖 ( 𝑚 𝑖𝑗 𝑤 𝑖 = 𝑚 𝑗𝑖 𝑤 𝑗 ) , where 221 .

The 𝑄 index is defined a 225 coefficient of degree between pairs of linked age groups and quantifies the weight of mixing 226 between individuals of the same age groups . A 𝑄 close to 0 represents little dependence of 227 mixing patterns on age while 𝑄 = 1 implies exclusivity of contacts within age groups 34 . Age - 228 specific contact matrices were stratified by physical vs . non - physical contact , sex , within vs . 229 outside household , within vs . outside Ndirande community , and adult HIV - positive vs . HIV - 230 negative status , as well as affected vs . unaffected by COVID - 19 and sex interations . 231 232 Spatial distance distribution of contact events 233 We used longitude and latitude GPS coordinates to calculate the Euclidian distance in 234 metres between participants’ houses and places of contact events . The inverse cumulative 235 distance distributions for physical and non - physical contacts and for the stratification by age 236 groups in relation to the distances away from homes were estimated 35 . All analyses were 237 conducted in R v4 . 1 .

Non - participation was mostly due to 251 relocation , and with only 3 % refusals . The proportion of study households within each cluster 252 ( relative to total census - counted cluster households ) and across clusters varied between 253 7 . 9 - 19 . 7 % and 4 . 0 - 10 . 0 % , respectively . The most common number of rooms per house was 254 four , of which two or three were most commonly used as bedrooms . The median household 255 size was 6 members ( interquartile [ IQR ] range 4 - 7 ) , with 53 ( 14 . 2 % ) households reporting 256 having at least one smoker ( cigarette , marijuana or local cigar ; chingambwe ) . Charcoal was 257 predominantly used as source of energy in 366 ( 96 . 8 % ) households , of which 200 ( 52 . 9 % ) 258 reported indoor cooking , and of which 23 ( 11 . 5 % ) were not well ventilated ( Figure S1 ) . 259 260 Overall , 1 , 201 participants were recruited , including 65 ( 5 . 4 % ) infants , 230 ( 19 . 2 % ) 261 preschool children , 265 ( 22 . 1 % ) primary school children , 188 ( 15 . 7 % ) secondary school 262 children , 301 ( 25 . 1 % ) adults and 152 ( 12 . 7 % ) older adults . Of enrolled participants , 702 263 ( 58 . 5 % ) were female , 138 ( 30 . 0 % of adults ) were unemployed , and the median age was 15 264 years ( IQR 5 - 32 ) . Among all adults aged 18 years or older , 201 ( 43 . 3 % ) had primary 265 education , 18 ( 3 . 9 % ) had no formal education , and 127 ( 27 . 1 % ) self - reported HIV - positive 266 status , all of whom were taking ART . In total , there were 12 , 540 reported contacts of whom 267 213 ( 1 . 7 % ) were infants , 1 , 161 ( 9 . 3 % ) preschool chldren , 3 , 239 ( 25 . 8 % ) primary school 268 children , 2 , 165 ( 17 . 3 % ) secondary school children , 4 , 765 ( 38 . 0 % ) adults , and 997 ( 7 . 9 % ) 269 older adults . The median age of contacts was 18 years ( IQR 10 - 32 ) . 9 , 341 ( 74 . 5 % ) contacts 270 occurred during Monday to Friday . The average number of contacts per person was 10 . 43 , 271 with 25 % , 50 % and 75 % of participants reporting at most 7 , 10 and 13 contacts , respectively 272 ( Figure 1 , Table 1 , Table S1 ) . 273 274 .

Similarly , households with at most three members had significantly lower contacts 341 ( 95 % CI : 7 . 70 - 10 . 07 ) than those with at least seven members ( 95 % CI : 10 . 43 - 11 . 19 ) . On the 342 contrary , the mean number of contacts did not significantly differ by sex , education status , 343 HIV status or interview day ( Table 1 ) . 344 345 In a multivariable analysis , age , occupation status , and household size were significantly 346 associated with daily number of contacts . Adults had the highest contact frequency among 347 all ages , over 30 % more than infants ( 1 . 38 , 95 % CI 1 . 16 - 1 . 63 ) . Unemployed adults ( less 348 active community members ) had 15 % ( 9 - 21 ) fewer contacts than business adults , usually 349 self - employed traders ( more active counterparts ) .

Participant - 372 contact mixing between male - male ( 𝑄 = 0 . 420 ) was more intense and highly assortative than 373 female - female ( 𝑄 = 0 . 163 ) or male - female ( 𝑄 = 0 . 106 ) or female - male ( 𝑄 = 0 . 096 ) .

Older age , employment , and 396 bigger households were significantly associated with an increased number of contacts in this 397 setting , consistent with previous social contacts studies 7 , 8 . Reported social contacts were 398 strongly age - assortative and intergenerational by sex , mostly physical and occuring within 399 household and geographically localised . Notably , neither HIV status , ART use nor COVID - 19 400 pandemic restrictions significantly reduced population - level social contacts behaviour . 401 402 The reported median number of contacts of 10 is similar to reported contacts among 403 internally diplaced people in Digaale camp in Somaliland 14 , but higher than the median of 4 404 contacts reported in a LIC in Zambia 12 , and lower than the 24 reported in Thailand 37 or 18 405 in rural Kenya 25 , highlighting the substantial role local context play in social contacts . The 406 completeness of contacts capture was strengthened by conducting participant’s interview 407 only on second visit with advanced notice to remember contacts on the day , guided 408 interview process collecting only contacts initials to start with and aiding participant’s 409 memory by structuring the interview to prompt participants to the different typical parts of the 410 day . Unlike MICs and HICs where the number of daily contacts usually are highest among 411 school age children 25 , 38 , our finding that working age adults had the largest number of 412 increasing daily contacts aligns with results from LICs in Zimbabwe and Somaliland 13 , 14 . 413 This suggests that schools may play a less prominent role in the transmission of infectious 414 diseases in LICs than they do in other parts of the world ; albeit that this may be counter - 415 balanced by children comprising a generally larger share of the population in LICs . 416 417 The 15 % relative higher average number of contacts among workers ( often self - employed 418 traders in this setting ) than among unemployed individuals is in line with evidence from 419 several previous studies irrespective of location 7 , and reflects the influence of human 420 .

Increasing number of contacts with 422 house size has also been reported in some MICs and HICs 7 , with household density 423 suggested to be a driving factor particularly in this setting where extended families sharing a 424 compound is common . We also report higher proportion of home contacts similar to other 425 LICs and MICs than those reported in HICs , and by contrast , the proportion of school and 426 work contacts were substantially lower than those in HICs 7 . This implies that household may 427 be a key site of transmission for respiratory diseases 40 , and public preventive measures 428 may only be efficacious at reducing the speed for spatial spread outside homes . However , 429 the relevance of contact location on transmission will also depend on , among other things , 430 specific pathogen and transmission routes e . g . droplet , fomite or aerosol 7 . 431 432 The strong age - assortative contacts in this study are consistent with widespread evidence 433 globally 7 , 8 , and support adjusting for age - heterogeneity when calibrating models for 434 predictions 41 , 42 . Approximately 80 % of contacts in this study were skin - to - skin , falling on the 435 higher side of the reported range of 19 - 84 % globally 7 . While the predominance of physical 436 contacts in children compared to adults is similar across all settings , substantial physical 437 contacts in our study align with reports in LICs and MICs but not HICs 7 . Social interactions 438 by women were less strongly age - assortative than for men , consistent with a greater role for 439 for intergenerational mixing between mothers or female guardians with younger children , as 440 also reported in Zimbabwe and Kenya 13 , 25 . Age - sex interactions showed relatively high age - 441 assortativeness among male - male contacts than other sex combinations , implying that 442 relatively small underlying biological or behavioural difference in susceptibility by sex may be 443 amplified by assortative social networks , as hypothesised for TB 12 . Moreover , relatively high 444 ( 97 % ) frequency of contacts occurring within rather than outside community in this study 445 may imply that epidemics would mostly be localised . However , adults > 15 years - old reported 446 the highest intense physical contacts including minibus travel with potential to disseminate 447 outbreaks outside of the local community . 448 .

In 450 this high HIV prevalence population with good access to ART , we found no evidence that 451 HIV status per se influences contact rates or age - assortativeness . Given that 452 immunosuppressed individuals may be at increased risk of prolonged COVID - 19 453 infectiousness and generation of new variants as well as increased pneumococcal carriage 454 43 , 44 , this suggests that HIV - positive individuals may have equivalent or increased potential 455 for contributing to respiratory disease transmission in this setting 45 . We have not , however , 456 assessed the other drivers of pathogen transmissibility , such as carriage density and 457 duration of infection , and so cannot confirm a likely disproportionate role in transmission . 458 459 Contrary to MICs and HICs who reported substantial reduction in social contacts due to NPIs 460 17 , 18 , 20 , only 25 % of participants in our study reported to have changes their contact behavior 461 between the second and third covid wave in Malawi . Furthermore , we did not find reduced 462 contact rates among participants who reported to have reduced their social contacts due to 463 COVID - 19 pandemic restrictions compared to those who reported to not have changed their 464 behavior . This may suggest sub - optimal adherence to COVID - 19 prevention measures such 465 as restricted movements , closing of non - essential businesses , enforced social distancing , 466 reduced public transportation capacity , and limited numbers ( recommended 10 people per 467 gathering ) in this setting , which may reflect the day - to - day demands in the context of 468 pressing economic hardship 46 – 48 . Economic implications of policy options aimed at limiting 469 transmission of respiratory diseases need to be considered in order to make pragmatic 470 recommendations that can be adhered to in the local context . Of note , relatively few per 471 capita hospitalisations and deaths from COVID - 19 occurred during the first wave in Malawi 472 despite evidence of widespread transmission , and this may explain low compliance with 473 recommendations to reduce social contacts during the second and third waves of COVID - 19 474 pandemic in urban Malawi . 475 476 .

We sampled households from 14 clusters making up a high proportion 480 of residential Blantyre . Substantial number of participants were recruited during weekdays 481 ( 75 % ) and weekends for representation and contact matrices were weighted for weekdays 482 and weekends and accounted for reciprocity . This study collected novel data on social 483 contacts in Malawi , adding insights to limited primary datasets on contact patterns in LICs in 484 Africa , with only 3 countries represented . Limitations include that reported contacts by 485 participants may be subject to recall bias 49 . This bias was partially addressed , however , by 486 conducting two visits within three days ; asking participants on the first visit to remember all 487 their contacts during waking up and going to bed , and on the second visit , asking 488 participants to report those contacts . Prospective reporting of cases reduces bias , but can 489 lead to overreporting 50 . Data on contacts within schools and other indoor spaces were not 490 collected at fine scale , hence are difficult to assess . Social contacts may change over time 491 19 , 20 , and our cross - sectional design did not include longitudinal sampling of mixing patterns . 492 Our results may not be generalisable to rural settings of Malawi that have relatively low 493 household density and socio - economic activities but large school sizes compared to urban 494 communities 51 . Thus , it remains uncertain whether or not contacts would be low given 495 mixed results from rural Zimbabwe and Kenya 13 , 25 . 496 497 In conclusion , high rates of physical , age - assortative and localised contacts were observed , 498 particularly among secondary school children and adults . With the demographic shift that 499 many LICs are undergoing this raises the potential for adults in this and similar settings to 500 play a more prominent role in the transmission of respiratory diseases than typically the case 501 in HICs . In addition , the lack of change in contact behavior in response to the ongoing 502 pandemic highlights specific challenges for mitigation strategies in poor communities with no 503 social protection mechanisms . For pandemic planning , it will be crucial to better understand 504 .

I will ask this for each of places you listed previously . Now I am only interested in your direct contacts . These are individuals with who you spent  5 mins , and with whom you spoke  3 words . For each of contact . I would like to know their age in years , sex , your relationship to him / her , where the contact happened , how often you contact this person in general , and the total time spent with this person in that place . I would also like to know whether contact was physical or nonphysical . Nonphysical contact happens when you haven’t touched the person . Physical contact includes hand shaking , embracing , kissing , and sharing a bike , and also sharing a glass or other utensils passed directly from mouth to mouth . I only ask for contact initials to help remember the contact , but will delete the information at the end of the interview . If you had contact with same person in multiple settings , I will record these multiple times , once for each setting . If you don’t know their exact age , you can take a best guess . Age Sex Contact type Relationship to contact Exact place of contact How often do you have contact with this person in general ? How much time did you spend with contact ?
