Introduction Since the emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS - CoV ) in 2012 , there have been 755 cases with a total 320 deaths in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia . 1 The virus was initially thought to affect older adults and those with underlying medical conditions . 2 The reporting of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases decreased the overall mortality rate and the mean age . 3 Data on viral kinetics in the respiratory tract and other body ﬂuids are scarce . In a recent case study , MERS - CoV shedding from the respiratory tract was detected until day 24 of illness . 4 In this study we investigated the viral shedding of MERS - CoV in the respiratory secretions of patients who were ill and those with mild disease who underwent repeated testing . 2 . Methods Patients who underwent more than one virological test for MERS - CoV at least 1 day apart were included in the analysis . Repeat testing was done non - systematically using respiratory tract samples from September 1 , 2012 to September 31 , 2013 . The types of respiratory specimen collected from patients and contacts were sputum samples , nose and throat swabs , nasopha - ryngeal swabs , and endotracheal aspirate samples . With regard to MERS - CoV screening , clinical samples were screened by real - time PCR ( RT - PCR ) ampliﬁcation test , as described previously , with ampliﬁcation targeting both the upstream E protein gene ( upE ) and ORF1a for conﬁrmation ; these are standard assays used in KSA for MERS - CoV testing . 2 , 5 International Journal of Infectious Diseases 29 ( 2014 ) 307 – 308 A R T I C L E I N F O Article history : Received 20 October 2014 Accepted 20 October 2014 Corresponding Editor : Eskild Petersen , Aarhus , Denmark Keywords : Middle East MERS - CoV RT - PCR Coronavirus Viral kinetics S U M M A R Y Background : Since the ﬁrst description of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS - CoV ) , it has not been known how long patients shed the virus in respiratory secretions . Thus , we analyzed the available data on time to negative MERS - CoV test in patients with conﬁrmed MERS - CoV infection and asymptomatic positive contacts . Methods : Data from repeated laboratory testing of respiratory samples received at the Saudi Arabian virology reference laboratory in Jeddah , Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from September 1 , 2012 to September 31 , 2013 were recorded . A real - time RT - PCR test for MERS - CoV was used . Data were analyzed by origin of sample , sample type , and MERS - CoV PCR test results . Results : Twenty - six individuals ( 13 patients and 13 contacts ) had repeated testing done until a negative test was obtained . Most samples from MERS - CoV cases were tracheal aspirate / sputum ( p = 0 . 0006 ) and most samples from contacts were nose and throat swabs ( p = 0 . 0002 ) . Kaplan – Meier curve analysis showed that contacts cleared the virus at a much earlier time than patients . On day 12 , 30 % of contacts and 76 % of cases were still positive for MERS - CoV by PCR . Conclusions : Contacts cleared MERS - CoV earlier than ill patients . This ﬁnding could be related to the types of sample as well as the types of patient studied . More ill patients with signiﬁcant comorbidities shed the virus for a signiﬁcantly longer time . The results of this study could have critical implications for infection control guidance and its application in healthcare facilities handling positive cases . (cid:2) 2014 The Authors .

The Kaplan – Meier method was used to calculate the time to negative repeat MERS - CoV RT - PCR test . ‘Positive test’ curves were drawn for patients and contacts who had repeated testing . The statistical signiﬁcance of the difference between the curves was assessed using a log - rank test . SPSS software ( SPSS for Windows , Version 11 . Chicago , IL : SPSS Inc . ; 2002 ) was used for the analysis . 3 . Results Twenty - six individuals ( 13 patients and 13 contacts ) under - went repeat respiratory sample testing until a negative test result was obtained . Table 1 shows the specimen type by category . Most samples from MERS - CoV cases were tracheal aspirate / sputum ( p = 0 . 0006 ) and most samples from contacts were nose and throat swabs ( p = 0 . 0002 ) . The Kaplan – Meier curve showed that contacts cleared the virus at a much earlier time than patients ( Figure 1 ) . On day 12 , 30 % of contacts and 76 % of cases were still positive for MERS - CoV by PCR . 4 . Discussion The viral kinetics and the time of shedding of MERS - CoV in the respiratory tract are not known . In previous case reports , MERS - CoV was isolated from the respiratory tract secretions up to day 24 in one patient , 4 and day 18 in another . 6 In this large retrospective analysis , cases had more prolonged viral shedding from the respiratory tract than contacts . The difference is related to the severity of the disease and the signiﬁcant underlying comorbidities among the cases . However , the study did not examine viral shedding systematically and thus patients with more severe disease may have been selected for repeat testing rather than those who had milder disease . A systematic and prospective study is required to further delineate the kinetics of MERS - CoV , not only in respiratory secretions but also in other body ﬂuids ( blood , urine , and stool ) . The reporting of these data is important to further characterize the pathogenesis of this disease and for better application of the infection prevention and control measures required . The need to quantify the viral load is also very important for any recommendations regarding the need for isolation of those who continue to have positive MERS - CoV by PCR . The presence of viral RNA in respiratory secretions may indicate a replicating or a dead virus . Although the data showed a difference between cases and contacts – contacts had more upper respiratory tract swabs tested , while cases had lower respiratory tract samples tested – the difference could be attributed to the sample type rather than the exposure type . We have previously shown that lower respiratory tract samples yield higher MERS - CoV viral loads and genome fractions than upper respiratory tract samples . 7 Since cases had lower respiratory tract samples collected more often than upper respiratory tract samples , this indicates that cases were more ill and probably shed virus much longer . This ﬁnding , if conﬁrmed by the prospective systematic collection of respiratory samples , would highlight the importance of applying prolonged infection control measures in severely ill patients with MERS - CoV in the healthcare setting . The pattern of transmission of MERS - CoV is well characterized as sporadic , intra - familial , and healthcare - associated . 8 – 10 The transmission of MERS - CoV within healthcare facilities was noted in the Al - Hasa outbreak , 11 and of 95 cases in one report , 63 . 2 % were healthcare - associated and 13 . 7 % were intra - familial transmission . 12 In support of the low infectivity of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases is the ﬁnding of a low transmission rate within family contacts . 13 Conﬂict of interest : No conﬂict of interest to declare .
