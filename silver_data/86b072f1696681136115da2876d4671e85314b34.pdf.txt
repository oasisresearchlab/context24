RES EAR CH A RT I C LE Open Access Reengineering of MeSH thesauri for term selection to optimize literature retrieval and knowledge reconstruction in support of stem cell research Yan Su 1 † , James Andrews 2 † , Hong Huang 2 , Yue Wang 1 , Liangliang Kong 1 , Peter Cannon 2 and Ping Xu 1 * Abstract Background : PubMed is a widely used database for scientists to find biomedical - related literature . Due to the complexity of the selected research subject and its interdisciplinary nature , as well as the exponential growth in the number of disparate pieces of biomedical literature , it is an overwhelming challenge for scientists to define the right search strategies and quickly locate all related information . Specialized subsets and groupings of controlled vocabularies , such as Medical Subject Headings ( MeSH ) , can enhance information retrieval in specialized domains , such as stem cell research . There is a need to develop effective search strategies and convenient solutions for knowledge organization in stem cell research . The understanding of the interrelationships between these MeSH terms also facilitates the building of knowledge organization systems in related subject fields . Methods : This study collected empirical data for MeSH - related terms from stem cell literature and developed a novel approach that uses both automation and expert - selection to create a set of terms that supports enhanced retrieval . The selected MeSH terms were reconstructed into a classified thesaurus that can guide researchers towards a successful search and knowledge organization of stem cell literature . Results : First , 4253 MeSH terms were harvested from a sample of 5527 stem cell related research papers from the PubMed database . Next , unrelated terms were filtered out based on term frequency and specificity . Precision and recall measures were used to help identify additional valuable terms , which were mostly non - MeSH terms . The study identified 15 terms that specifically referred to stem cell research for information retrieval , which would yield a higher precision ( 97 . 7 % ) and recall ( 94 . 4 % ) rates in comparison to other approaches . In addition , 128 root MeSH terms were selected to conduct knowledge organization of stem cell research in categories of anatomy , disease , and others . Conclusions : This study presented a novel strategy and procedure to reengineer term selections of the MeSH thesaurus for literature retrieval and knowledge organization using stem cell research as a case . It could help scientists to select their own search terms and build up a thesaurus - based knowledge organization system in interested and interdisciplinary research subject areas .

Su et al . BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making ( 2016 ) 16 : 54 DOI 10 . 1186 / s12911 - 016 - 0298 - z Background In this “ big data ” era , the richness of information and the speed at which it spreads is nearly unimaginable . While this may improve convenience , it also leads to a certain disorder of both information and knowledge . This poses a challenge that can impede the effective use of research publications and related knowledge . This problem re - quires numerous efforts to build new strategies of infor - mation retrieval or knowledge organization in order to facilitate knowledge discovery and analysis [ 1 ] . Scientific literature is an important part of the overall universe of information resources . Quantitative analysis of this provides a basis for knowledge management that requires highly accurate information retrieval . Among the numerous challenges with achieving quality retrieval , two are particularly salient in the context of stem cell re - search . First , across various scientific disciplines that may be interested in stem cell research , there is variance in expressing the same concept . Thus , it is very difficult to list every synonym ( or quasi - synonym ) for each con - cept . Second , some technologies cover content in dispar - ate knowledge fields , and therefore cannot be searched from a single perspective . For example , tissue engineer - ing covers a broad range of scientific research , and so it is difficult to anticipate and provide for all the related search terms without creating a unique ontology or other techniques . Recognizing this as a research topic that is important not only in the context of stem cell research but in other domains , we have designed an approach to partially but effectively address the problem of literature retrieval and classification [ 2 , 3 ] . At present , three databases , PubMed , Web of Know - ledge , and Scopus , are widely used in biomedical inform - atics [ 4 , 5 ] . Each of these three platforms can be called a Knowledge Organization System ( KOS ) , another term for a classification system or , depending on its semantic structuring , a thesaurus , which allows for statistical analysis of the retrieval results [ 4 ] . Among these three platforms , only PubMed indexes literature with a stan - dardized vocabulary , the Medical Subject Headings ( MeSH ) . MeSH is a highly representative and widely used controlled vocabulary designed for the indexing of journal articles , books , and related artifacts in the health and life sciences [ 6 , 7 ] . Within the MeSH vocabulary , se - mantics are clear and it has strict norms combined with logical relationships among terms . When appropriately applied , MeSH has the potential to clearly provide sub - ject headings for the biological information being com - municated through an article [ 8 , 9 ] . It is widely considered the most effective controlled terminology for biomedical literature retrieval and certain types of infor - mation mining [ 5 , 10 – 13 ] . Using controlled , organized vocabularies or thesauri , such as MeSH , enables re - searchers to spend less time and effort in synonym merging and polysemy splitting to ascertain relationships between terms and concepts . As a KOS , a thesaurus can sort and reorganize know - ledge according to the content and characteristics of the subject . When used in literature retrieval , a thesaurus can recognize hyponymy of a retrieved field and recognize the sophisticated classification of the retrieved data set [ 14 , 15 ] . By doing so , thesauri can be helpful for solving the problem of retrieval by improving recall and precision . However , thesauri often express specific things while data analysis is broader and involves items of a similar property , otherwise known as a category . That is to say , when a category is retrieved using one or two terms from the thesaurus , it may not be enough to narrow the search enough to find appropriate results [ 16 , 17 ] . Additional thesauri need to be included and merged into different categories . Furthermore , a the - saurus such as MeSH includes many terms that cover all the areas of health science , in order to manage know - ledge and for effective retrieval . MeSH terms and the current hierarchical structure , therefore , might lack “ spe - cificity ” to identify a precise set of thesauri to fully repre - sent the concepts and knowledge structure in a special interdisciplinary research area [ 18 ] . This is needed for stem cell research in order to retrieve literature with sat - isfactory rates of precision and recall . Although covering a broad range of topics in health sciences , the hierarchical structures of MeSH do not have the specificity required in specific technical do - mains such as stem cell research . This is one of the rea - sons why it is not ideal for patient records . However , many concepts in MeSH showed as “ hierarchical tree structure ” do have rather specific sub - concepts or so - called “ children ” ( even in more than one tree ) , but these are not always the semantic relations or syntactic struc - tures needed for a particular context ( such as stem cell research ) . For example , the term “ K562 Cells ” resides in the lower level of “ Myeloid Progenitor Cells ” and is an important keyword in the field of stem cells . However , the term “ K562 Cells ” is related to the cell lines widely used in regular lab experiments , and it has little to do with the stem cells research . In a literature search using “ Myeloid Progenitor Cells , ” the system traversed the “ child ” terms , including “ K562 Cells ” , and thus the search could bring in noisy literature . In fact , multiple , combinational search keywords were needed to cover full - specific topics , such as stem cell re - search . Both automated and / or human recommended MeSH terms were used for the literature search and annotation [ 19 , 20 ] . Professional searchers craft combin - ational search queries when using MeSH to search spe - cific subjects . The terms reside discretely or aggregate in different locations of the hierarchy structure of the MeSH “ tree structure . ” For example , the hyponyms of Su et al . BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making ( 2016 ) 16 : 54 Page 2 of 10 “ stem cells ” include “ embryonic stem cells , ” “ induced pluripotent stem cells , ” “ adult stem cells ” and “ cancer stem cells ” in the field of stem cell research . However , stem cell research covers an even wider scope , and terms such as “ hematopoietic stem cell transplantation , ” “ stem cell microenvironment ” and “ transdifferentiation ” are not hyponyms under “ stem cells . ” Therefore , only using “ stem cells ” to search might omit certain relevant re - search related literature . MeSH indexing is based on the concept level , and for stem cell research activities , such as knowledge discovery and organization , one or two MeSH terms are usually not enough to represent the complexity of stem cell research . We propose to address this by attempting to reconstruct MeSH into a classified thesaurus based on a specific perspective and context . The stem cell area is at the cutting - edge of science re - search . New breakthroughs are frequently and actively re - ported in the literature . Some of them were listed in the top ten lists of scientific breakthroughs in Science Maga - zine since 1999 . Stem cells , or related derivatives , can be transplanted into a patient to replace damaged cells and regenerate new cells or tissues [ 21 ] . It brings new hope for the treatment of “ incurable diseases ” [ 22 ] . Using stem cells for the development of disease models for drug screening and / or pinpointing disease mechanisms can help re - searchers understand the mechanism of pathogenesis for complex diseases [ 23 ] . Stem cell research is a rapidly changing field , and it an interdisciplinary and multi - faceted area of study . Selecting all of the relevant stem cell literature from the interconnected disciplinary based lit - erature databases required scientists to create a better set of key words to allow for search completeness and accur - acy . The exploration of stem cell related MeSH classifica - tions could also benefit the knowledge construction and classification for further future stem cell research . This reconstruction is the process of knowledge reorganization . If embedded into a retrieval system , the classified thesaurus will create literature category naviga - tion and automatic classification . This helps achieve an automated literature analysis that would be useful in serving the information needs of researchers in this do - main , which could be replicated for other research areas . Methods Figure 1 shows the technical approach used for the con - struction of a thesaurus specifically referring to stem cells ( TSRSC ) , classification frameworks , and classified thesauri . This involved a term selection strategy that combined both automation and expert selection to process specially harvested MeSH terms for information retrieval and knowledge reconstruction . This method in - cluded the following steps : ( 1 ) . Construction of the TSRSC . The MeSH vocabulary includes a variety of terms about stem cells primarily under the MeSH term “ stem cells , ” although there are other related terms under other term nodes . Terms for the TSRSC were identified based on MeSH term frequencies in the literature sample . In addition , stem cell research experts from Shanghai Institutes for Biological Science , Chinese Academy of Science , helped identify additional stem cell related MeSH terms that are not indexed but are otherwise important in the field . In our study , we collected the literature sample from PubMed and each stem cell research - related article was indexed with 7 – 8 MeSH terms . It should be noted , however , that , during this process , it is possible that some stem cell research related MeSH terms were not included . Additionally , experts helped identify other Fig . 1 The process of MeSH terms selection and construction of the TSRSC Su et al . BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making ( 2016 ) 16 : 54 Page 3 of 10 highly relevant terms that were not MeSH terms that would be included for information retrieval , improving the recall and precision ratios of the literature retrieval sets for stem cell research . The recall and precision ratios were tested and the experts were further consulted to optimize TSRSC . ( 2 ) . Classification framework . Based on the existing classification scheme , this study developed a specific classification framework for stem cell research . Such a classification framework was built to be suitable for literature analysis of stem cells , including disease categories such as neoplasms , cardiovascular disease , and respiratory tract diseases , as well as for technology categories like reprogramming and stem cell transplantation . ( 3 ) . Classified thesaurus . High - frequency MeSH terms from a stem cell - related subset were filtered and classified into different categories . The classification thesaurus was optimized by follow - up retrieval experiments . The classified thesaurus was built following the method outlined in Fig . 2 , which included : 1 . A sample of stem cell literature selected from 17 stem cell specific journals . In total , 5527 stem cell - related arti - cles were obtained from the years 2002 / 01 / 01 to 2011 / 12 / 31 . The MeSH terms were extracted and their fre - quencies were counted . The articles were randomized into a set of 1000 . It was determined that 98 . 6 % of the articles in the set were about stem cells , indicating that the sample was representative of stem cell research . 2 . MeSH term frequency statistics . MeSH term frequencies were calculated and ranked in the literature sample . A total of 4253 MeSH terms were obtained . Their term frequencies were ranked from the highest to the lowest . A cutoff of three was selected with a subset of 1825 MeSH terms . They were further identified and classified by stem cell experts . This subset represented over 95 % of total occurrences of all MeSH terms with a good coverage for the sample of the literature . 3 . Excluding unrelated keywords . Common words , such as “ Human , ” “ Animals , ” and “ Cell Line ” are too general and , therefore , were excluded . In addition , other MeSH terms , such as those related to protein subunits , DNA sequencing , and other chemical molecules , were removed from the list due to their broad meaning and difficulty in being classified . A total of 1320 terms were excluded while the experts retained 525 keywords for the next phase . 4 . Coarse - grained classification of MeSH terms . Experts determined the remaining MeSH terms one by one , labeling them as referring to “ Specific terms ” , “ Related terms ” , or “ Others ” . “ Specific terms ” are those TSRSC terms that can be used to retrieve stem cell research literature and include keywords such as “ stem cells ” and “ nuclear reprogramming . ” These terms were derived from the judgment of the experts via a word selection process . This process was completed to determine whether the MeSH term itself specifically referred to stem cells , and if so , tracing it to the parent MeSH term to a point where the parent MeSH term was no longer related to stem cells . 18 MeSH terms were obtained using this process . “ Related terms ” referred to those used for fine - grained classification and retrieval , literature analysis , as well as the analysis for the disease type literature retrieval . Thus , for example , in order to explore stem cells in the development of diseases research , MeSH terms such as “ neoplasms ” and “ musculoskeletal diseases ” were included in this category . The “ Others ” category included terms that were not in the TSRSC or related terms . These can be reserved for later , fine - tuned retrieval experiments . Therefore , if the subsequent feedback retrieval results , or if retrieval recall precision , is not ideal , then the other MeSH terms can be used to conduct further ana - lysis , taking into consideration whether it can discrim - inate better when added to TSRSC or related terms . 5 . Retrieval experiment . Articles were retrieved using TSRSC , and the recall and precision ratio were subsequently computed . A series of retrieval experiments were conducted , and adding or removing terms from searches optimized the recall and precision ratios for the tested the search terms . The set of search terms was finalized when the search result was satisfied . 6 . MeSH term classification . 128 root MeSH terms served as the core sets used to build the stem cell research classification framework ( Additional file 1 : Table S1 ) , and then categories were added , which was required by the literature analysis . The goal of this procedure is to build a classification system to group these candidate MeSH terms based on anatomy , disease or stem cell types etc . , so that they can facilitate literature classification and facilitate easy information access and retrieval . The TSRSC and related terms were both classified into these categories . If a MeSH term was classified into a category , the upper node MeSH terms were considered and classified into the category if possible . 7 . Refinement of the TSRSC and the classified thesauri . The precision and recall ratios for both TSRSC and the classified thesauri were computed ; the terms set were refined and updated based on the retrieval Su et al . BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making ( 2016 ) 16 : 54 Page 4 of 10 Fig . 2 Flow Chart of the tasks to obtain thesauri specifically referring to stem cells ( TSRSC ) Su et al . BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making ( 2016 ) 16 : 54 Page 5 of 10 experiments . Non - MeSH terms from the articles which have not been retrieved were added to the TSRSC ( Additional file 2 for non - MeSH terms as TSRSC ) . 8 . Precision and recall experiments . For the TSRSC , the recall ratios were computed using related modified search terms , or TSRSC , to ascertain how many articles out of the total 5527 - article sample set could be retrieved . The precision ratios were calcu - lated by randomly selecting 100 articles and having the experts discern whether or not an article is re - lated . This randomized sampling was repeated three times . In the final test , with a TSRSC - assistant search done for accuracy , the precision ratio was calculated based on a random sample of 1000 arti - cles from the retrieval results . For the classified thesauri , 300 articles were randomly selected from the retrieval result set of TSRSC . Experts examined the classification of the articles . For example , if it was determined that 240 out of 300 articles belonged to cardiovascular disease , then this classified thesauri set for cardiovascular disease was used for the recall test . This test was repeated three times . The precision ratios were measured by a randomized selection of 100 articles for each classified thesaurus set retrieval result ( Table 2 ) . Experts then determined if the articles were relevant to the classified thesaurus set . The random selection of 100 articles for precision was repeated three times . Results Construction of thesauri specifically referring to stem cells ( TSRSC ) A set of MeSH terms was chosen for the TSRSC based on term frequency and artificial discrimination , reducing the number to 15 terms that specifically refer to stem cells , including “ Stem Cells , ” “ Stem Cell Transplant - ation , ” and “ Nuclear Reprogramming . ” The MeSH terms were then organized into a tree structure . The 15 terms refer to the root node terms ( Additional file 2 , terms highlighted as red ) and there may be a hierarchy of chil - dren nodes under the root nodes . “ HL - 60 Cells , ” “ U937 Cells ” and “ K562 Cells ” are the hyponyms of TSRSC . However , they also are hyponyms of some non - TSRSC . While these terms are related to the cell lines widely used in labs , they have little to do with stem cells . When searching in PubMed , for example , the search engine will automatically search the hyponyms of the search terms . Therefore , they might bring noise ( unrelated search return of literature ) in retrieval . These words , therefore , were re - moved from the TSRSC . In addition , 5 non - MeSH terms were supplemented —“ stemness , ” “ stem cell , ” “ progenitor cell , ” “ ipsc , ” and “ ips cell . ” These new terms can improve the recall and precision ratios , especially for newer articles that do not have indexed MeSH terms . To better illustrate all these search terms , such as TSRSC , non - MeSH , or terms with noise , these terms were visualized ( see Additional file 2 ) and their hierarch - ical relationships under MeSH . Multiple retrieval experi - ments were conducted to optimize the TSRSC . As a result , the recall ratio was 97 . 70 % and the precision ra - tio was 94 . 4 % ( Table 1 ) . For the convenience of future studies , the following nesting search query that contained all the terms in TSRSC can be used by scientists when they conduct a lo - gical search query for stem cell - related articles in PubMed . The query contains multiple OR and NOT operators that connect with other search terms that have been tested for their quality in precision and recall ratios : Search query = ( “ Stem Cells ” OR “ Stem Cell Transplantation ” OR “ Nuclear Reprogramming ” OR “ Hematopoiesis ” OR “ Stem Cell Niche ” OR “ Bone Marrow Transplantation ” OR “ Adipogenesis ” OR “ Cell Transdifferentiation ” OR “ Stem Cell Research ” OR “ Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization ” OR “ Nuclear Transfer Techniques ” OR “ Cell Dedifferentiation ” OR “ Stem Cell Factor ” OR “ Blastocyst Inner Cell Mass ” OR “ Tumor Stem Cell Assay ” OR “ stemness ” OR “ stem cell ” OR “ progenitor cell ” OR “ ipsc ” OR “ ips cell ” ) NOT ( “ HL - 60 Cells ” OR “ U937 Cells ” OR “ K562 Cells ” ) The retrieval results of searching “ stem cell , ” or using the TSRSC terms in PubMed , were compared . Using the search term “ stem cell ” obtained 114 , 390 articles ( 2002 / 01 / 01 ~ 2011 / 12 / 31 ) . However , using the TSRSC search , it yielded 131 , 960 articles ( 2002 / 01 / 01 ~ 2011 / 12 / 31 ) . An additional data mining algorithm for text clustering was used to further validate the retrieval results . Five hun - dred articles were randomly selected from each of the retrieval results and the MeSH terms were extracted . Then a literature vector space model was built using R . For example , if it is assumed having two articles , x ( t ) and y ( t ) , then MeSH terms as topics for article x are T 1 , T 2 , T 3 , T 4 , and MeSH terms for article y are T 2 , T 4 , T 5 , T 6 , T 7 , respectively . Let T represent the union set of the MeSH terms as the topics for both article x and y . When t has its value as T 1 , T 2 , T 3 , T 4 , then x ( t ) = 1 , otherwise x ( t ) = 0 ; when t has its value as T 2 , T 4 , T 5 , T 6 , T 7 then y ( t ) = 1 , otherwise y ( t ) = 0 . Then the matrix of article x ( t ) and y ( t ) is showed as the following : T T 1 T 2 T 3 T 4 T 5 T 6 T 7 x ( t ) 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 y ( t ) 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 Su et al . BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making ( 2016 ) 16 : 54 Page 6 of 10 The average article similarity as cosine ( x , y ) was calcu - lated to cluster the articles ( Eq . 1 ) . The clustering is based on the hypothesis that the article similarity is larger when the value of cosine ( x , y ) is bigger [ 24 ] . The result indicated that the article similarity of “ stem cell ” is 0 . 8188 versus a TSRSC of 0 . 8423 . The text clustering re - sult shows that the TSRSC , despite using more words , makes the literature cluster closer rather than more dispersed . This supports our hypothesis that there is a significant correlation in the TSRSC words . This rela - tionship makes retrieval using the TSRSC more accurate . cos x t ð Þ ; y t ð Þ ð Þ ¼ X t ∈ T x t ð Þ y t ð Þ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃX t ∈ T x t ð Þ 2 ⋅ X t ∈ T y t ð Þ 2 r ð 1 Þ Classified thesaurus for knowledge organization In Table 2 , it is demonstrated how MeSH terms can be used to build thesaurus ( MeSH ) - based classification sys - tems for stem cell - based knowledge organization , such as for anatomy . Examples for stem cell - based knowledge organization systems for anatomy , stem cell types , disease related , and stem cell related can be found in Additional file 1 . Within each category , a set of MeSH terms can be used for a retrieval task to obtain literature related to a specific category ( Additional file 1 ) . Retrieval experiments were conducted to measure the optimization of the classified thesaurus . The recall ratio ranged from 80 . 5 to 100 . 0 % , and the precision ratio ranged from 82 to 100 % . In addition to the recall ratio for all selected jour - nals , a recall ratio for the special journal sample was per - formed . For this , 50 specialized journals for cancer were randomly chosen and then the neoplasm cat - egory thesaurus was used to perform a retrieval test . The recall ratios of the cancer journals were then compared . Since all of the categories do not have a devoted special journal , only a few categories were tested for the recall ratios within cancer journals . Even though this method uses more samples , the re - sults are similar to the general recall ratio mentioned above . High recall and precision ratios were obtained in every category except for adult stem cells in Table 3 . We found that the term “ adult stem cells ” was indexed in - completely in PubMed . Many articles regarding this term were indexed as “ stem cells ” instead of “ adult stem cells . ” In addition , there were no “ child ” node terms under the term “ adult stem cells . ” Thus , the recall ratio was low . To improve the recall ratio , additional search terms were added , such as “ hematopoietic stem cells , ” “ hematopoietic stem cell transplantation , ” and “ neural stem cells , ” to the category of “ adult stem cells ” . These additional search terms were found to be more specific and feasible in order to yield more search returns of relevant literature . Through this , the recall ratio was increased to 62 . 7 % , which importantly indi - cated that scientists prefer certain terms than stan - dardized MeSH terms to describe a scientific topic . Since there are numerous types of adult stem cells , further investigation and expert consultation may be needed and new , non - MeSH terms should be consid - ered to enrich the TSRSC , such as “ bone marrow - derived mesenchymal stromal cells , ” “ mesenchymal stromal cells from bone marrow , ” and “ MSCs from bone marrow . ” In addition , it is important to note that the categories themselves are crossed , so a MeSH term may belong to more than one category . How - ever , this phenomenon does not affect the accuracy of literature retrieval .

BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making ( 2016 ) 16 : 54 Page 7 of 10 Discussion In this study , the procedure of constructing a classified the - saurus was explored and validated through precision and recall ratio tests of combinatory literature search queries with selected MeSH based terms , understanding these terms ’ hierarchy relationships , and grouping MeSH terms into different stem cell based knowledge organization systems . The principles of construction were : 1 ) The MeSH terms were classified based on high / low frequency ; 2 ) Reject terms with too general concept and terms of some substances , such as protein , DNA sequence and molecule ; 3 ) Expert judgement for term selections ; and 4 ) Retrieval experiment . The validity of the TSRSC was tested by a Vector Space Model . The results of this portion of the study supported the hypothesis that there is significant correl - ation between the TSRSC terms and retrieval results . Careful selection of a set of appropriated TSRSC terms provided thorough and precise search results . The retrieval results proved to yield both high recall and precision ratios . In the future , a classified thesaurus for other fields can be constructed following this method . This method can be enhanced by automation , in which artificial intelligence programs can pre - filter some redundant or unrelated terms , such as protein and DNA sequence , to reduce the judgment - work of experts . Data mining pro - grams can also be used to count the MeSH term fre - quencies , which would include root nodes . In this way , the position of the terms can be quickly ascertained . Furthermore , the MeSH terms can be further classified into a subcategory to provide a further break - down of knowledge organization . MeSH is an authoritative controlled vocabulary that is highly effective for bibliographic retrieval for systems that use it . However , studies and literature reviews on inter - indexer consistency often find variability and in - consistency , with consistency rates in the 20 – 40 % range [ 25 – 27 ] . Our method takes this into consideration and , in part , addresses this problem to enhance term specifi - city by looking at how these terms posit in the su - bcategories within the thesaurus . This is helpful for improving retrieval results of the MeSH terms , which are indexed incompletely . If these selected MeSH terms and the process of stem cell - based knowledge reorganization can be embedded into a retrieval system , the classified thesaurus could support literature category navigation and automatic classification , further achieving automated literature analysis . Using stem cell research literature as a case study , it was possible to research topic - based knowledge organization schemes , refine , and extend the utilization of MeSH terms and the hierarchical structures for organized stem cell research . This method also facilitates classification - based literature navigation , literature auto - classification , and benefiting knowledge discovery and mining , and scientific data analysis . The classification of stem cell research literature is more than just simply cross - walk between classification schemes ( e . g . , Dewey Decimal System ) or thesauri ( e . g . , MeSH ) , Table 3 Retrieval result of classified thesaurus set for anatomy ( partial ) Category Recallratio a Precisionratio b Recall ratio ( special journal sample ) Cardiovascular System 92 % 93 . 3 % 92 . 4 % Respiratory System 88 % 91 . 6 % 100 % Digestive System 90 % 100 . 0 % 89 . 2 % Neuro - Sensory System 89 % 100 . 0 % 96 . 3 % Musculoskeletal and Integumentary System 87 % 94 . 1 % 86 . 6 % Urogenital System 92 % 100 % 90 . 3 % Hemic and Immune Systems 82 % 100 % 93 . 8 % Cardiovascular Diseases 97 % 94 . 1 % Respiratory Tract Diseases 94 % 80 . 5 % Digestive System Diseases 92 % 88 . 6 % Nervous System Diseases 89 % 93 . 7 % Eye Diseases 96 % 100 . 0 % Musculoskeletal Diseases 97 % 85 . 0 % Integumentary System Diseases 93 % 89 . 1 % Urogenital System Diseases 90 % 92 . 3 % Hemic and Immune Systems Diseases 90 % 93 . 7 % Endocrine System Diseases 94 % 92 . 6 % Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases 88 % 87 . 8 % Congenital , Hereditary , and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities 89 % 90 . 0 % Neoplasms 84 % 93 . 0 % 91 . 7 % Graft vs Host Disease 84 % 88 . 8 % Virus Diseases 99 % 83 . 3 % Wounds and Injuries 98 % 87 . 5 % Embryonic Stem Cells 99 % 100 . 0 % Adult Stem Cells 94 % 62 . 7 % Neoplastic Stem Cells 94 % 100 . 0 % Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells 99 % 100 . 0 % Reprogramming 96 % 96 . 6 % Stem Cell Transplantation 100 % 94 . 0 % Ethics 96 % 100 . 0 % a Recall ratio : Investigates how many articles are retrieved using classified thesauri ( Randomly select 300 articles from 5527 and classify them into different categories as benchmarks . ) b Precision ratio : Randomly select 100 articles retrieved by classified thesauri and examine whether they belongs to the category Su et al .

Thus , the fine - gained classification method proposed in this study provides a new way to con - struct classification schemes , thus enhancing clarity . The study provided new potentials to possibly merge different classification schemes or metadata connecting with differ - ent retrieval systems . It also proposed possible unified re - trieval solutions , then obtain related literature across different databases or information repositories . Better than the cross - walk approach between two schemas that might have the potential to miss important information , our ap - proach can evaluate the search term selection efficiency in precision and recall , as well as provide an assessment of their positions and relationships within the MeSH hierarchy structure . The build - up of combinational searchable query using selected MeSH terms could im - prove literature retrieval and knowledge organization re - gardless of the complexity of the scientific subject , even it is interdisciplinary across several fields . The research findings suggested that the TSRSC query given is useful to improve the literature retrieval in stem cell research , but replication of the methodology is re - quired for new queries in other scientific domains as the query is specific to the scientific domain of stem cell re - search . In order to foster query creation and method - ology in other domains , information professionals should advise researchers that the expert steps require significant time and resource investment in order to achieve quality results . Conclusions This study demonstrated a new approach that can mechanically identify and refine a set of MeSH terms to facilitate literature retrieval and knowledge organization in a particular scientific domain . The study also identi - fied non - MeSH terms that were valuable for improving precision and recall for literature retrieval and therefore enrich the descriptions of a dynamic and interdisciplin - ary research area such as stem cell research . Based on the reconstructed thesaurus created from these selected terms , the study indicated that identifying a proper set of MeSH terms , and their alternatives , improves the pre - cision and recall ratios of the literature retrieval . Through a case study of stem cell research , we explored a way to construct a classified thesaurus , thus offering one possible solution to the problem of literature re - trieval . This classified thesaurus results from a know - ledge reconstruction that categorizes existing thesauri and ultimately improves the retrieval of clustered litera - ture . With experiment - proven efficacy , this exploration lays the foundation for future work – automatic literature classification and navigation which may serve science and technology management . This approach can guide scientists , medical researchers , and librarians to use MeSH , or other tools , to construct a set of domain - specific search terms for literature research ; simultan - eously , this study will allow information professionals to develop a MeSH - based classified thesaurus for know - ledge management in regards to a particular research topic . The approach outlined in this study can optimize retrieval performance and knowledge organization by selecting the right MeSH terms when dealing with a dy - namic and complex scientific research topic for scientists .
