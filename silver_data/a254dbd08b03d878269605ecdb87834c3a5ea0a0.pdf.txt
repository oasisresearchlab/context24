Abstract : Mechanoregulation of cell – extracellular matrix ( ECM ) interactions are crucial for dictating pluripotent stem cell differentiation . However , not all pluripotent cells respond homogeneously which results in heterogeneous cell populations . When cells , such as mouse epiblast stem cells ( EpiSCs ) , are cultured in clusters , the heterogeneity effect during differentiation is even more pro - nounced . While past studies implicated variations in signaling pathways to be the root cause of heterogeneity , the biophysical aspects of differentiation have not been thoroughly considered . Here , we demonstrate that the heterogeneity of EpiSC differentiation arises from differences in the colony size and varying degrees of interactions between cells within the colonies and the ECM . Confocal imaging demonstrates that cells in the colony periphery established good contact with the surface while the cells in the colony center were separated by an average of 1 – 2 µ m from the surface . Traction force measurements of the cells within the EpiSC colonies show that peripheral cells generate large tractions while the colony center cells do not . A ﬁnite element modeling of EpiSC colonies shows that tractions generated by the cells at the colony periphery lift off the colony center preventing the colony center from undergoing differentiation . Together , our results demonstrate a biophysical regulation of heterogeneous EpiSC colony differentiation . Keywords : EpiSCs ; cell – ECM interactions ; differentiation ; heterogeneity ; colony size 1 . Introduction From the beginning stages of a totipotent zygote , cells undergo differentiation that is analogous to a ball rolling down a landscape , passing through various pluripotent states such as inner cell mass and subsequent later - stage epiblasts . Adaptation of in vitro culture of a pre - implantation inner cell mass is referred to as the naïve pluripotent state , while the early post - implantation epiblasts represent the primed pluripotent state . Cells rolling down further on the differentiation cascade become multipotent progenitors and ﬁnally differentiate into adult body cells . Embryonic stem cells have been derived success - fully from many species , including humans [ 1 ] . These conventional human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) are considered to be in the primed state that can be induced to more naïve - like hESC states [ 2 – 4 ] . Although mouse embryonic stem cells ( mESCs ) [ 5 , 6 ] were derived in 1981 , the mouse epiblast stem cells ( EpiSCs ) [ 7 , 8 ] were established fairly re - cently in 2007 . Interestingly , there are striking similarities between primed hESCs and mouse EpiSCs in terms of morphology , clonogenicity , global gene expression , and cytokine Cells 2023 , 12 , 326 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 3390 / cells12020326 https : / / www . mdpi . com / journal / cells Cells 2023 , 12 , 326 2 of 13 requirements [ 7 , 9 , 10 ] . Due to poor clonogenicity , both hESCs and mouse EpiSCs are pas - saged as colonies rather than single cells . For these reasons , the conventional hECSs and mouse EpiSCs are considered to be equivalent in terms of developmental stages . A simple and robust method for maintaining homogeneous EpiSC culture in vitro has been developed by introducing a Wnt inhibitor , IWP - 2 , in the culture medium [ 11 ] . However , upon induction of differentiation , pluripotent EpiSCs elicit a heterogeneous response [ 12 ] , similar to hESCs [ 13 – 15 ] . Importantly , the underlying biophysical mechanism of such heterogeneous differentiation of EpiSCs remains largely unknown . Herein , we systematically investigated if mouse EpiSCs differentiate , similar to mouse ESCs [ 16 ] , when seeded on ﬁbronectin - coated surfaces . In addition , we determined the biophysical mechanism of heterogeneous EpiSC differentiation outcome . EpiSC colonies on ﬁbronectin - coated surfaces applied forces on the periphery which lift off the inner colony cells , away from the ﬁbronectin - coated surface , thus preventing differentiation in the colony center . As a result , the colony edges differentiate , but not the colony center . The larger the physical size of the colony , the more heterogeneous the cell populations become . Our systematic approach reveals an important biophysical mechanism of heterogeneous EpiSC colony differentiation on ﬁbronectin - coated surfaces that otherwise would remain unknown . 2 . Materials and Methods 2 . 1 . EpiSC Culture and Treatments EpiSCs , isolated from post - implantation embryos , were routinely cultured on mi - totically inactivated feeders as described elsewhere [ 11 ] with Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle Medium / Nutrient Mixture F - 12 basal medium ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc , Waltham , MA , USA ; cat . # 10565018 ) supplemented with 15 % KNOCKOUT Serum Replacement ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc , cat . # 10828028 ) , 1 % Penicillin Streptomycin ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc , # 15140122 ) , 1 % MEM non - essential amino acid ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc , cat . # 11140050 ) , 0 . 1 mM 2 - Mercaptoethanol ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ; cat . # M3148 ) , 20 ng / mL Activin A ( Peprotech , cat . # 120 - 14E ) and 12 ng / mL bFGF ( Peprotech , Cranbury , NJ , USA ; cat . # AF - 100 - 18B ) , and 2 µ M IWP - 2 ( Tocris Bioscience , Minneapolis , MN , USA ; cat # 3533 / 10 ) . For passaging , colonies were mildly dissociated in small clumps every other day with CTKCa dissociation buffer . The CTKCa dissociation buffer was made with Trypsin , Collagenase IV , KNOCKOUT Serum Replacement , and CaCl 2 in PBS . 2 . 2 . EpiSC Differentiation on Fibronectin For differentiation experiments , EpiSC clusters were cultured on 1 µ g / mL ﬁbronectin - coated tissue culture dishes ( Eppendorf North America , Enﬁeld , CT , USA ) . The dishes were incubated with ﬁbronectin for 1 h at 37 ◦ C . For traction experiments , EpiSC clusters were seeded on ﬁbronectin - coated ( 5 µ g / mL ) polyacrylamide ( PAA ; a mixture of acrylamide and bis - acrylamide ; Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA , USA ) substrates and cultured for 24 h before traction measurements . 2 . 3 . Measuring Cellular Tractions on PAA Substrates Cell traction measurements have been described elsewhere [ 17 ] . In short , images of PAA substrates , embedded with yellow - green ﬂuorescent microbeads ( 0 . 2 µ m ) , were captured before and after the trypsinization of cells . The displacement ﬁeld was calculated based on the relative movement of beads with or without cells attached to the substrate . A Fourier Transform Traction Cytometry ( FTTC ) - based calculation revealed a traction map from the displacement ﬁeld using the Boussinesq solution . In - house custom MATLAB codes were used for the traction force microscopy . 2 . 4 . Wideﬁeld Epiﬂuorescence Microscopy and Confocal Imaging Phase images of differentiated and semi - differentiated colonies were obtained using an EVOS microscope ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) equipped with a 10 × objective . The total area and pluripotent area were calculated using ImageJ software . Fluorescent images were Cells 2023 , 12 , 326 3 of 13 captured with an inverted wideﬁeld epiﬂuorescence microscope ( Leica DMi8 ) equipped with 20 × , 40 × , and 63 × objectives , an Orca Flash 4 . 0 V2 + sCMOS camera , and a motorized stage for x - y - z position control . The microscope is also equipped with an air stream incubator for temperature control . A multiline scanning confocal microscope [ 18 ] , equipped with an Andor EMCCD cam - era and an NA1 . 4 / 100 × Olympus objective , was used to calculate the height distribution of the periphery vs . the center of the EpiSC colonies . To ﬂuorescently visualize the cells , EpiSCs were ﬁxed with 4 % PFA and stained with CellMask Green plasma membrane dye ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) . 2 . 5 . Quantifying Peripheral Differentiation within the Colony To quantify the peripheral differentiation and pluripotent center regions of the colonies , the entire colony was ﬁtted with a circle of radius R while the peripheral differentiation regions were measured by mean radial vectors , represented by ρ . The extent of differ - entiation for each colony was calculated by a differentiation penetration ratio : ρ R . For fully differentiated colonies , no pluripotent core was observed ; hence , the differentiation penetration ratio was found to be 1 . 0 . In other words , when the ratio ρ R was smaller than 1 . 0 , there was a heterogeneous population present within the colony . 2 . 6 . Finite Element Analysis of EpiSC Colonies ANSYS 2019 R1 Academic solver and ANSYS 2022 R1 Student postprocessing tools were used for the analysis . EpiSC colony geometries were created based on phase - contrast colony images . For both the 1 . 67 kPa and the 16 . 7 kPa condition colony models , the total number of identiﬁed nodes was 2865 , with a total number of solid elements set to 1292 after meshing . The order and mesh type were program - controlled to minimize errors . An error check was performed with “aggressive mechanical shape checking setting” and no such errors were identiﬁed by the software . The mesh size was selected within the 10 – 100 µ m range . The following material properties were assigned to the ﬁnite element EpiSC colony models . An isotropic elasticity of 1 kPa and 5 kPa was assigned to the colony model for the 1 . 67 kPa and the 16 . 7 kPa PAA substrate conditions , respectively . The Poisson’s ratio was assigned to 0 . 49 . The colonies were ﬁxed at the bottom around the periphery , excluding the center of the colony . The forces were assigned around the edges with different magnitudes as quantiﬁed from the r . m . s . tractions . Forces were applied in “in - plane” conditions . The net force , calculated from traction experiments , was 0 . 32 ± 0 . 14 µ N and 1 . 7 ± 0 . 71 µ N for the 1 . 67 kPa and the 16 . 7 kPa PAA substrates , respectively . 2 . 7 . Statistical Analysis The Student’s t - test was carried out for statistical signiﬁcance testing . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . The EpiSC Colony Size Dictates Differentiation Heterogeneity The cloning efﬁciency and survival of EpiSCs after single - cell dissociation are very poor . As a result , the EpiSCs were cultured in colonies , and in every passage , the colonies were mechanically broken into small clusters . In addition , for unknown reasons , mitotically inactivated feeder coculture is reported to be indispensable for EpiSC culture success to maintain pluripotency . Following these culture conditions , the fragmented EpiSC clusters appear undifferentiated with well - deﬁned boundaries on mitotically inactivated feeders as displayed in Figure 1A .

( A ) A phase image of an EpiSC colony displays a pluripotent morphology on mitotically inactivated feed - ers using standard culture protocol . ( B – C ) Phase images of EpiSCs on fibronectin - coated surfaces reveal significant heterogeneity in EpiSC differentiation as a function of colony size . When the col - ony size was small , differentiation was homogeneous . As the colony size increased , pluripotency was conserved in the center while differentiation was observed only on the colony periphery . ( D ) The percentage of pluripotent and differentiated cells within the individual colonies is represented as a function of the total colony area . n = 17 colonies from three independent experiments . Scale bar , 200 µm . During differentiation , mitotically inactivated feeders were removed from the cul - ture and the colonies were plated on surfaces coated with desired peptides , proteins , and extracellular matrix ( Figure S1 ) . The cell adhesion , spreading , and overall morphology of EpiSCs on various functionalized surfaces were observed to be significantly different . EpiSC colonies show a round spherical morphology when plated on collagen - mimicking peptide GFPGER while EpiSCs on poly - l - lysine - coated surfaces showed a highly differ - entiated morphology ( Figure S1 ) . The observed cell death was significant on both the GFPGER and the poly - l - lysine - coated surfaces . Interestingly , when EpiSCs were plated on E - cadherin - coated surfaces , cells appeared as single cells similar to single ESCs plated on E - cadherin - coated surfaces and may possibly lead to self - renewal as single cells [ 19 ] . On the other hand , EpiSC colonies when seeded on fibronectin - coated surfaces show a differentiated morphology with little to no cell death . In addition , fibronectin via α 5 β 1 and α V β 3 integrin signaling promotes strong adhesion and is known to induce differentiation in mouse pluripotent stem cells [ 16 ] . Therefore , we focused on studying mechanically Figure 1 . EpiSC differentiation heterogeneity is caused by the physical size of the colony .

( B , C ) Phase images of EpiSCs on ﬁbronectin - coated surfaces reveal signiﬁcant heterogeneity in EpiSC differentiation as a function of colony size .

In addition , ﬁbronectin via α 5 β 1 and α V β 3 integrin signaling promotes strong adhesion and is known to induce differentiation in mouse pluripotent stem cells [ 16 ] . Therefore , we focused on studying mechanically fragmented Cells 2023 , 12 , 326 5 of 13 EpiSC clusters on ﬁbronectin - coated surfaces . To understand the differentiation effect of ﬁbronectin alone , we used the same recipe of EpiSC culture medium that promotes self - renewal throughout all the experiments with no changes to soluble factors . Depending on the physical size of the clusters , the EpiSC colony differentiation response varied largely . For large colonies , cells on the periphery appeared to be differentiating and cells in the colony center exhibited a pluripotent morphology ( Figure 1B ) . To clarify further , we created a Voronoi diagram to visualize the morphological difference of cell / nuclear size between the colony center and the periphery ( Figure S2 ) . Both the cell size and the nuclear size in the colony periphery appear to be larger than the colony center . Furthermore , we also labeled cytoskeletal F - actin with rhodamine - phalloidin where cells in the colony center show very little F - actin localization with no deeper F - actin cytoskeletal network ( Figure S3 ) ; in contrast , the cells on the colony periphery display an extensive F - actin cytoskeletal network ( Figure S3 ) . Increased cell spreading and extensive F - actin cytoskeletal network in cells on the colony periphery indicate initiation of differentiation . As the colonies grew , the differentiation was primarily localized only to the outer periphery of the colonies while the pluripotent core remained conserved in the center . Interestingly , for a smaller colony size ( < 5 × 10 5 µ m 2 ) , the pluripotent core disap - peared , and the differentiation efﬁciency increased signiﬁcantly ( Figure 1C , D ) . In other words , a smaller colony size ( < 5 × 10 5 µ m 2 ) reduces cellular heterogeneity during differen - tiation . Figure 1D shows the percentage of colony cells with a pluripotent or differentiated morphology as a function of the projected colony area . When the colony size was small ( ~ up to 5 × 10 5 µ m 2 ) , more than ~ 90 % of the cells within the colony appeared differentiated ( red line ) while only ~ 10 % of the cells within the colony appeared pluripotent ( blue line ) ( Figure 1D ) . When the colony size progressively increased , the percentage of differentiated cells decreased with a concomitant increase in the percentage of pluripotent cells . 3 . 2 . A Colony Size Threshold Exists over which Cell Differentiation Becomes Heterogeneous In addition to the morphological investigations , to explore the status of pluripotent markers , we carried out an immunocytochemistry assay for Sox2 expression of individual cells within the colonies . When EpiSCs were cultured on mitotically inactivated feeders , Sox2 was present uniformly throughout the colony , and there were no visible signs of differentiating edges ( Figure 2A ) . In contrast , when colonies were plated on ﬁbronectin - coated surfaces , it was evident that Sox2 was not expressed uniformly throughout the colonies . Instead , it was localized in the center of the colonies but not at the periphery of the colonies ( Figure 2B ) . Therefore , the differentiation was primarily restricted to the periphery since the pluripotent marker Sox2 was absent , which is consistent with the morphological characterization in Figure 1 . To model the extent of differentiation within the colonies as a function of the relative size of the colonies , we deﬁne a parameter , ρ , indicating the average radial distance of the differentiation band at the periphery of the colonies ( Figure 2B ; right ) . The radius , R , of the colonies was approximated by ﬁtting a circle to the entire colony size . We deﬁne the ratio ρ R as the differentiation penetration ratio of the colonies and plotted the ρ R for all the colonies imaged as a function of the colony area as shown in Figure 2C . With larger colony size ( > 5 × 10 5 µ m 2 ) , the differentiation penetration ratio , ρ R , remained similar around 0 . 3 – 0 . 5 , suggesting a poor differentiation outcome . In other words , differentiation heterogeneity could be observed for colony sizes over ~ 5 × 10 5 µ m 2 . In contrast , when the colony size was small ( < 2 × 10 5 µ m 2 ) , the differentiation penetration ratio , ρ R , was found to be 1 . 0 , indicating a 100 % differentiation within the colony . We did not observe any colony sizes between 2 × 10 5 and 5 × 10 5 µ m 2 in these experiments , and therefore , in the transition zone ( Figure 2C , yellow bar ) the differentiation penetration ratio ( i . e . , presence of heterogeneity ) could not be evaluated . Further investigation is needed to elucidate the heterogeneity pat - tern within the transition zone ; nevertheless , a clear threshold of colony size ( > 5 × 10 5 µ m 2 ) could be observed , over which , the cell differentiation becomes heterogeneous . Cells 2023 , 12 , 326 6 of 13 Cells 2023 , 11 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 14 5 × 10 5 µm 2 ) could be observed , over which , the cell differentiation becomes heterogene - ous . Figure 2 .

( B ) A phase image ( left ) and the corresponding fluorescent image ( right ) show Sox2 expression in a differentiating colony . Sox2 was primarily ex - pressed in the colony center . The outer peripheral band of the EpiSC colonies was found to be Sox2 negative . To model the differentiation effect , an average radial distance of differentiation , 𝝆 , was defined . The radius of the colonies , 𝑹 , was approximated by fitting a circle of known radius . ( C ) The scatter plot shows the ratio 𝝆 𝑹 as a function of the total area of the colonies . A 𝝆 𝑹 value of smaller than 1 . 0 indicates differentiation heterogeneity , which was found to be pronounced when the pro - jected colony area was > 5 × 10 5 µm 2 . 3 . 3 . Reduced Cell – ECM Contact in the Colony Center Prevents Differentiation Since cells in the periphery were differentiating but not cells in the colony center , we postulated that there might be a varying degree of cell – ECM contact within the colonies which gives rise to the differentiation heterogeneity . To determine the extent of cell – ECM contacts within the colonies , we imaged the colonies in 3D using confocal microscopy at varying distances from the periphery to the center of the colonies . As before , EpiSC colo - nies on fibronectin - coated surfaces were fixed and stained with CellMask green plasma membrane dye .

Reduced Cell – ECM Contact in the Colony Center Prevents Differentiation Since cells in the periphery were differentiating but not cells in the colony center , we postulated that there might be a varying degree of cell – ECM contact within the colonies which gives rise to the differentiation heterogeneity . To determine the extent of cell – ECM contacts within the colonies , we imaged the colonies in 3D using confocal microscopy at varying distances from the periphery to the center of the colonies . As before , EpiSC colonies on ﬁbronectin - coated surfaces were ﬁxed and stained with CellMask green plasma membrane dye . Figure 3 shows the brightﬁeld and corresponding ﬂuorescent cell boundary images at different distances from the colony periphery . In Figure 3A , the ﬁrst row displays brightﬁeld images ( left panel ) of well spread out cells within the colony at the periphery ( d = 0 µ m ) with corresponding ﬂuorescent images in the x – y plane ( middle panel ) . The y – z plane images are shown in the right panel for the two white dotted lines in the x – y Cells 2023 , 12 , 326 7 of 13 plane . From these images , it is evident that strong cell – ECM contact exists at the periphery . At a distance of 240 µ m from the periphery ( d = 240 µ m ) , similar good contact between the cell and ECM was observed . However , close to the colony center , at a distance of 440 µ m from the periphery ( d = 440 µ m ) , cells were not well spread out , appeared more rounded , and showed gaps between cells and the surface ( Figure 3B ; arrowheads ) . At the colony center ( d = 480 µ m ) , the gaps between the cells and surface are even more pronounced ( Figure 3B , bottom row ; arrowheads ) , thus creating reduced cell – ECM contacts and preventing ﬁbronectin on the surface to induce cell differentiation . Furthermore , to validate a difference in cell – ECM contacts between the periphery and the colony center , we ﬁxed and stained EpiSC colonies with a paxillin antibody . Figure S4 shows positive focal adhesion contact in the colony periphery but not in the colony center .

At the colony center ( d = 480 µm ) , the gaps between the cells and surface are even more pronounced ( Figure 3B , bottom row ; arrowheads ) , thus creating reduced cell – ECM contacts and preventing fibronectin on the surface to induce cell differentiation . Fur - thermore , to validate a difference in cell – ECM contacts between the periphery and the colony center , we fixed and stained EpiSC colonies with a paxillin antibody .

Traction Stresses at the Colony Periphery Lead to Heterogeneous Differentiation Since a differential cell – ECM interaction was observed for the colony periphery and the center , we next investigated the tractions generated within the colonies . Based on reduced cell – ECM contact observation , we speculated that traction stresses would also vary between the colony periphery and the center . Traction stresses are an important parameter to determine stress - mediated cell differentiation of pluripotent cells [ 20 ] . The overall role of Cells 2023 , 12 , 326 8 of 13 forces / stresses and force - mediated signaling in regulating the fate decisions of stem cells has been reviewed elsewhere in detail [ 21 ] . As predicted , the traction magnitude at the basal colony surface was found to be high at the periphery and low at the colony center ( Figure 4A ) , which is consistent with the 3D confocal imaging data in Figures 3 and S4 . EpiSCs plated on 16 . 7 kPa substrate exhibited a root mean square ( r . m . s . ) traction of ~ 40 Pa ( Figure 4B ) . To reduce the traction in the cell periphery , we used the Y27632 compound , an inhibitor of Rho - kinase ( ROCK ) . With Y27632 compound treatment , the r . m . s . traction of the EpiSC colonies was reduced to ~ 17 Pa ( Figure S5 ) . In addition , previous studies have shown that Arp2 / 3 was present on the leading edge which inﬂuences leading - edge protrusion and motility [ 22 ] . Therefore , we focused on inhibiting the Arp2 / 3 complex that may be responsible for the nucleation of the branched actin cone dynamics at the colony periphery . We tested with two small molecule inhibitors of the Arp2 / 3 complex , namely , CK666 and CK869 [ 23 ] . When we treated EpiSC colonies with CK666 , the r . m . s . traction magnitude at the basal surface was found to be ~ 20 Pa , similar to the treatment with the Y27632 compound ( Figure S5 ) . With CK869 treatment , the reduction of traction was more pronounced ( ~ 10 Pa ) but not statistically different from the Y27632 and CK666 treatment groups ( Figure S5 ) . Next , we plated EpiSCs on 10 - fold softer substrates ( 1 . 67 kPa ) , and the r . m . s . traction was found to be signiﬁcantly lower at ~ 10 Pa . Unlike the colonies on the 16 . 7 kPa substrates which generated uniform traction around the colony periphery , the colonies on the 1 . 67 kPa substrates generated occasional peak tractions of low magnitude around the colony periphery . Interestingly , the shape of the colonies was very similar , thus suggesting that EpiSC colonies were able to sense substrate rigidity and accordingly modulate their basal tractions . In comparison , pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cell colonies also exhibited r . m . s . traction between 40 and 50 Pa depending on the substrate stiffness [ 20 ] . However , mouse embryonic stem cell colonies did not exhibit differential tractions between the colony periphery and the center . Therefore , the elevated tractions in the colony periphery in combination with reduced traction in the colony center is a unique feature of EpiSC colonies . 3 . 5 . A Putative Model Explaining Cell Heterogeneity during EpiSC Colony Differentiation To simulate whether the forces at the colony periphery are causing the EpiSC center to lift off , we used a ﬁnite element analysis ( FEA ) model to investigate the deformation in the z - direction throughout the colony . We developed an EpiSC - speciﬁc FEA model with an arbitrarily assigned elasticity of 5 kPa . As cells were plated on 16 . 7 kPa substrate , it is assumed that cells within the EpiSC colonies will tune their intrinsic stiffness to match that of their underlying substrate . However , cell stiffness matching with the substrate stiffness begins to plateau at around 20 kPa with a measured cell stiffness of ~ 5 kPa [ 24 ] . Therefore , the assigned elasticity of 5 kPa to EpiSCs on a 16 . 7 kPa substrate is a reasonable estimation . The modeled colony images were acquired from phase - contrast microscopy images . For assigning the force boundary conditions , inward forces of 1 . 7 µ N were applied on the periphery of the colony as indicated in Figure 4C . Furthermore , the colony was ﬁxed at the bottom , around the periphery , excluding the colony center . We justify this boundary condition based on the experimental traction force measurements ( Figure 4 ) , confocal imaging ( Figure 3 ) , and focal adhesions as visualized by paxillin staining ( Figure S4 ) . After running the FEA simulation , a heatmap of the total deformation vector throughout the colony is presented in Figure 4C . The peak deformation in the colony center was found to be ~ 3 . 8 µ m in the colony center ( Figure 4C ) . As expected , the z - deformation gradually diminished towards the periphery . Next , we analyzed the peak z - deformation in the colony center for an EpiSC colony on a 1 . 67 kPa substrate . The assigned elasticity was 1 kPa , and forces applied on the colony periphery were set to 0 . 32 µ N . As before , we followed the substrate stiffness matching trend to assign an elasticity of 1 kPa for EpiSC colonies on a 1 . 67 kPa substrate [ 24 ] . In addition , the applied forces were based on traction force measurements on 1 . 67 kPa substrates . The total deformation vector shows distortion in the colony center with a peak deformation of ~ 3 . 6 µ m , similar to EpiSC colonies on 16 . 7 kPa Cells 2023 , 12 , 326 9 of 13 substrates ( Figure S6 ) . Regardless of the substrate stiffness and force boundary conditions , it is clear that the center of the EpiSC colony will be elevated , which is consistent with the confocal microscopy data as shown in Figure 3 . Based on these ﬁndings , we propose a putative model for EpiSC colony differentiation as shown in Figure 4D . Cells in the EpiSC colony periphery establish strong contact with the ECM and generate inward traction along with the initiation of the differentiation process . The generated inward traction at the colony periphery elevates the colony center . As a result , the colony center maintains pluripotency , thus resulting in heterogeneous differentiation within the same EpiSC colony . Cells 2023 , 11 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 14 Figure 4 .

A Putative Model Explaining Cell Heterogeneity during EpiSC Colony Differentiation To simulate whether the forces at the colony periphery are causing the EpiSC center to lift off , we used a finite element analysis ( FEA ) model to investigate the deformation in the z - direction throughout the colony . We developed an EpiSC - specific FEA model with an arbitrarily assigned elasticity of 5 kPa . As cells were plated on 16 . 7 kPa substrate , it is assumed that cells within the EpiSC colonies will tune their intrinsic stiffness to match that of their underlying substrate . However , cell stiffness matching with the substrate stiffness begins to plateau at around 20 kPa with a measured cell stiffness of ~ 5 kPa [ 24 ] . Therefore , the assigned elasticity of 5 kPa to EpiSCs on a 16 . 7 kPa substrate is a reasonable estimation . The modeled colony images were acquired from phase - contrast microscopy images . For assigning the force boundary conditions , inward forces of 1 . 7 µN were ap - plied on the periphery of the colony as indicated in Figure 4C . Furthermore , the colony was fixed at the bottom , around the periphery , excluding the colony center . We justify this Figure 4 .

Discussion In this study , we investigated how EpiSCs as a colony respond to mechanical forces when allowed to generate endogenous forces during differentiation . We found that only the cells on the colony periphery establish good contact with the ﬁbronectin - coated surface Cells 2023 , 12 , 326 10 of 13 and undergo differentiation but not the cells in the colony center . Our study showed that large colonies generate traction forces that elevate the colony center and support the maintenance of self - renewal in the colony center . It is to be noted that ﬁbronectin alone was sufﬁcient to initiate differentiation , and no differentiation induction medium was used during this study . When cells establish good contact with ﬁbronectin - coated surfaces and are allowed to generate mechanical forces , they undergo cell differentiation . The underlying mechanism is further discussed elsewhere [ 25 ] . Past studies have demonstrated that mouse mESCs differentiate in the presence of ﬁbronectin or synthetic Arg - Gly - Asp ( RGD ) peptides [ 16 , 26 ] . In contrast , when mechanical forces were dominated by cell – cell adhesion ( e . g . , via E - cadherins ) , as opposed to cell – ECM ( e . g . , ﬁbronectin ) interactions , the cell fate was directed towards self - renewal [ 19 , 27 ] , and any interference of E - cadherin would cause morphological changes and differentiation [ 28 , 29 ] . EpiSCs on the colony center may be interacting with neighboring cells via E - cadherins , which translates into self - renewal , while EpiSCs on the colony periphery are favoring differentiation via cell – ECM ( ﬁbronectin ) interactions . Although it is not the focus of this paper , our preliminary studies regarding EpiSC adhesion on E - cadherin indicate the possibility of pluripotency maintenance as single cells rather than colonies , which will be investigated in the future . It is not quite clear if the dominance of force signaling in cell – cell vs . cell – ECM pathways exists in vivo during mammalian embryogenesis ; however , the current evidence seems to support this notion . From totipotent zygote to downstream pluripotent stages , the role of mechanical force via E - cadherins can be critical since E - cadherin - null mouse embryos only form loose cell aggregates , thus failing to develop into animals [ 30 ] . In the later stages of the blastocyst development , when ﬁbronectin is ﬁrst expressed in the embryo , there may be a switch in mechanical force transduction pathways which leads to force transduction dominance via cell – ECM instead of cell – cell interactions . Whether it is cell – cell ( via E - cadherins ) or cell – ECM ( via integrin – ﬁbronectin ) interactions , the actomyosin forces can be presumed to play very important roles in embryogenesis . In our study , we may be observing similar events in the EpiSC center vs . the periphery . Fibronectin has an opposite role in the fate decisions of mouse vs . human pluripotent stem cells . Although mouse EpiSCs share similarities with conventional hESCs in many ways , the activation of mechanotransduction pathways via ﬁbronectin for cell fate decisions of mouse vs . human pluripotent stem cells is very different [ 31 ] . Fibronectin and its binding partners such as α 5 β 1 integrins are essential in mouse embryonic development and serve to support mesenchymal cell migration during embryogenesis [ 32 , 33 ] . Embryos that are null for ﬁbronectin or α 5 β 1 integrins show distinct defects in mesodermal development [ 34 , 35 ] . In addition , ﬁbronectin or ﬁbronectin - mimicking RGD tripeptides - based mechanotrans - duction studies showed initiation of cell differentiation of mouse ESCs [ 21 ] . Furthermore , ﬁbronectin has been shown to activate the ERK / MAPK pathway to induce differentiation in mouse ESCs [ 16 ] . In contrast , ﬁbronectin has been shown to support the long - term self - renewal of hESCs [ 36 ] . In addition , a gelatinous protein mixture ( commonly known as Matrigel ) containing a trace amount of ﬁbronectin has been widely used for the mainte - nance of hESC self - renewal . Therefore , there is an opposing biological role of ﬁbronectin in mouse pluripotent cells vs . conventional hESCs . In this study , we show that mouse EpiSCs , similar to mESCs , differentiate on ﬁbronectin - coated surfaces . However , EpiSC differentiation , particularly for large colonies , was restricted to the peripheral cells only . The generated tractions at the periphery elevate the colony center preventing cell differentiation . Therefore , cell heterogeneity can be observed in EpiSC colonies during differentiation . The regulation of endogenous forces in hESCs after cell dissociation is very critical . The cortical tension generated by actomyosin contractility in hESCs induces apoptosis , but the inhibition of Rho - associated protein kinase ( ROCK ) relieves this reliance [ 37 ] . We wondered if the ROCK inhibitor can downregulate traction in the colony periphery . With the ROCK inhibition , EpiSCs minimized traction generation in the periphery and , subsequently , the entire colony made contact although the r . m . s . tractions were 2 . 5 times lower than the control group . Similarly , when cells were treated with Arp2 / 3 complex Cells 2023 , 12 , 326 11 of 13 inhibitors , namely , CK666 and CK869 [ 23 , 38 ] , we successfully reduced the generation of the peripheral tractions . However , the overall r . m . s . tractions were downregulated , similar to the ROCK inhibitor . Mechanical forces , whether endogenously generated or externally applied via integrin pathways , are known to play an important role . If EpiSCs were allowed to develop uniform tractions throughout the colony , it may result in cell differentiation homogeneity . However , with downregulated r . m . s . tractions , the overall cell differentiation outcome is currently not known and is beyond the scope of this work . In the future , various concentrations of ROCK and Arp2 / 3 complex inhibitors will be tested , and the differentiation outcome will be evaluated . In addition to ﬁbronectin , the inﬂuence of laminin or type - IV collagen may be investigated to determine EpiSC colony response and subsequent cell lineage commitments . 5 . Conclusions Taken together , we show that EpiSCs differentiate on ﬁbronectin - coated surfaces , similar to mouse ESCs , without any addition of differentiation - inducing soluble factors . Importantly , we identiﬁed the biophysical mechanism of cellular heterogeneity during EpiSC colony differentiation—the physical size of the colony is what dictates differential interactions with the ﬁbronectin - coated surface and triggers varying differentiation re - sponses . With large EpiSC colonies , the colony periphery establishes good contact with the ﬁbronectin - coated surface and , thus , generates inward traction force around the periphery . Tractions generated in the colony periphery lift off the colony center . As a result , only the colony periphery undergoes differentiation but not the colony center . In contrast , for small colonies , the differentiation efﬁciency was found to be very high with little to no observed differentiation heterogeneity .
