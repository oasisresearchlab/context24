Examples of our studies are used to illustrate the use of six methodologies : mathematical simulation , software engineering , case , survey , field study , lab experiment , and conceptual ( subjective / argumentative ) based on an established taxonomy of MIS research methods . Examples of synergism attained through use of a multi - methodological approach are provided .
