They are recognized by cells via specific re - ceptors present on the cell membrane and are internalized through endocytosis [ 2 ] . The dimensions of nanomaterials are roughly equivalent to the intracellular organelles . The ability of nanomater - ials to interact directly with cells makes them unique tools for in - fluencing biological pathways and processes . Interactions between living organisms and nanomaterials affect cell physiology and trigger both positive and negative reactions [ 3 ] . As the interaction between nanomaterials and cells becomes better understood , new materials are designed for specific cell - material interactions . The plethora of natural and synthetic nanomaterials and their intricate interactions with different cell types justify preparing a compendium on the information accumulated over the past five years to create a back - drop for interested parties to continue the legacy in this exciting research arena . The intracellular milieu contains compounds for cell growth , proliferation , differentiation and death that are distributed throughout the cytoplasm , nucleus , mitochondria , endoplasmic re - ticulum and Golgi complex [ 4 ] . Endocytosis opens a window of op - portunity for communication of materials , energy and information between the inside and outside of cells ; such a process provides the essential link for life and physiological activities [ 5 , 6 ] . The size , charge and surface composition of nanomaterials determine their internalization pathways . The low pH and enzyme - rich intracellular environment as well as the presence of lysosomes may result in degradation or non - specific distribution of nanomaterials [ 7 , 8 ] . The ability of nanomaterials to overcome these obstacles has led to the development of platforms to improve their bioavailability [ 9 ] . Na - nomaterials may be optimized by adjusting their physicochemical properties [ 10 ] . Understanding the mechanisms involved in cellular uptake is also critical for evaluating the fate and toxicity of nano - materials . Many infectious diseases in humans are caused by biovectors such as viruses and bacteria that enter cells for replication . Pathogens have evolved efficient strategies to be internalized into host cells , as exemplified by the entry of the coronavirus SARS - CoV - 2 into pneumocytes that accounts for the COVID - 19 pandemic [ 11 , 12 ] . As natural nanoscale biovectors , viruses typically range from 10 to 300 nm in dimensions and are the blueprints for the synthesis of many bioengineered nanomaterials [ 13 ] . Viruses are highly variable in shape and are coated with ligands . Most non - enveloped and en - veloped viruses enter host cells by protein - mediated endocytosis [ 14 , 15 ] . Virus entry is a highly active process involving a series of biochemical signaling pathways [ 16 ] . The efficacy and specificity of viral interaction with host cells have stimulated enormous research to uncover the physical and biochemical mechanisms exploited by viruses to enter cells . These strategies may be adopted for designing nanomaterials for disease targeting . Answering fundamental ques - tions on cellular intake of viruses will pave the way for a more ef - ficacious design of biomimetic nanomaterials [ 17 ] . Similar to viruses , bacteria have surface ligands that induce specific intracellular sig - naling cascades [ 18 ] . The recent discovery that bacteria can access cells via clathrin - mediated pathways suggests that endocytosis plays an important role in the entry of these biovectors into cells [ 19 ] . Participation of bacteria in endocytosis will not be covered in the present review because they are too large to be classified as na - noscale objects . Intracellular uptake and transport pathways of nanomaterials will be summarized in the present review . The properties of nano - materials such as size , shape , charge and surface chemistry , as well as the effects of the intracellular microenvironment on nanomaterial internalization , will be discussed . Understanding the physicochem - ical properties of nanomaterials and their cellular absorption me - chanisms will facilitate scientists to design better functional nanomaterials for biomedical applications . Such knowledge will also provide important clues for the control of viral infections and the treatment of virus - induced infectious diseases . Serendipitous and intentional human encounter with nanomaterials Humans are exposed to an extensive array of nanoscopical bio - vectors as well as metal - based and carbon - based nanomaterials that enter the internal milieu of cells unintentionally . Nanomaterials that are designed for targeting specific tissues such as tumors may ac - cumulate in non - cancerous cells , resulting in undesirable cytotoxi - city . Because nanomaterials are much smaller in size compared to cells , they can penetrate human cells by inhalation , ingestion or skin absorption during human activity . Such untoward uptakes often P . Makvandi , M . Chen , R . Sartorius et al . Nano Today 40 ( 2021 ) 101279 2 result in unanticipated interaction of the biovectors and nanoma - terials with cellular proteins and intracellular macromolecules [ 20 ] . Apart from serendipitous entries , humans also uptake nanoma - terials intentionally , often in the form of bioengineered entitles that are developed for medical diagnosis and therapy . Some of these nanomaterials are used as carriers for drugs and biomolecules to improve their release kinetics [ 21 ] . These carriers protect and sta - bilize their payloads and enhance therapeutic bioavailability for two purposes : tuning the rate of delivery and precision delivery of the therapeutic agent to a destined site within the human body . For example , polymeric nanomaterials such as poly ( lactic - co - glycolic acid ) and ceramic - based nanomaterials such as mesoporous silica have been tuned to load and release biomolecules at a designer - optimized rate to a targeted site . Apart from solely functioning as carriers , some nanomaterials are also utilized as diagnostic / ther - apeutic agents themselves . The most well - known examples of these functional nanomaterials are silver nanoplatforms , which are used as antimicrobial materials [ 22 ] , and gold nanoplatforms , which are used as biomarkers and anti - cancer photothermal agents [ 23 ] . Na - nomaterials may also be conjugated with pharmaceutical com - pounds to enhance their therapeutic efficacy via synergistic interactions . For example , polyethylene glycol - stabilized gold na - norods containing doxorubicin are used as photothermal agents and as carriers for the delivery of the anti - cancer drug . The aforemen - tioned nanosystems are intentionally introduced into human body via the bloodstream along the trajectory that they are exposed to and interact with different types of cell proteins [ 24 ] . An in - depth understanding of the mechanisms of endocytosis enables the development of strategies for inhibiting the undesirable effects of serendipitous cell entry , as well as for minimizing the cytotoxicity of intentionally administered nanosystems to healthy cells and optimizing efficacious delivery of the loaded biomolecules to the cytosol of targeted cells . Endocytosis mechanisms for nanomaterials Functional and nonfunctional nanomaterials find their way into cells via endocytosis . This method of intracellular ingress involves the formation of phagocytic membrane invaginations and in - tracellular vesicles [ 25 , 26 ] . Endocytosis may be divided into pino - cytosis and phagocytosis . Pinocytosis is the major route of uptake for smaller particles and phagocytosis is the preferred route for the ingress of larger particles ( > 500 nm ) . Pinocytosis is subdivided into clathrin - mediated endocytosis , caveolae - mediated endocytosis , as well as clathrin - and - caveolae - independent endocytosis [ 27 ] . The endocytosis pathways for the intake of nanomaterials are summar - ized in Fig . 1a . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is a vesicular transport event that facilitates internalization and recycling of receptors en - gaged in processes such as signal transduction , nutrient uptake and synaptic vesicle formation . This is the canonical internalization process for most nanomaterials in non - macrophages . The pathway enables intracellular absorption of plasma membrane components and nutrients such as cholesterol through lipoprotein receptors , and iron through transferrin receptors [ 28 ] . According to the interaction during internalization , CME may be divided into non - specific ad - sorption and receptor - mediated absorption . In non - specific re - ceptor - independent CME , absorption occurs via hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions , eventually resulting in internalization [ 29 ] . In contrast , receptor - mediated CME is initiated only after a specific macromolecule ( ligand ) or ligand - encased nanomaterial binds to a receptor on the surface of the cell membrane . Non - specific CME adsorption is triggered by binding of cationic particles or proteins to the negatively - charged cell surface . Unlike adsorption , receptor - mediated CME is highly - selective and specific [ 25 ] . The process involves the polymerization of clathrin , a triske - lion - shaped scaffold protein , around the cytoplasmic side of an in - vaginated pit [ 30 ] . The polymerized clathrin coat functions as a reinforced mold in which the membrane vesicle eventually forms and enlarges ( Fig . 1b ) . Initiation of a clathrin complex requires the accumulation of phosphatidylinositol ‑ 4 , 5 – bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) and adapter proteins such as AP - 2 at the pinching site [ 31 , 32 ] . After the coat is assembled , the actin filament network polymerizes at the endocytosis site to form an actin module [ 33 ] . Contraction and scission of the invaginated necks of the clathrin - coated vesicles are mediated by BAR domain ( Bin , amphiphysin and Rvs ) proteins , dynamins and dephosphorylation of PIP2 [ 34 ] . The vesicles are then transported and sorted , based on the receptor type or membrane composition , to various intracellular destinations such as the trans - Golgi network , endosomes or vacuoles . Dynamins , a family of membrane fission guanosine - 5 ′ - triphosphatases ( GTPases ) , bind to and assemble into a helical polymer around the neck of a clathrin - coated vesicle . Constriction of the dynamin helix around the vesicle neck via GTP hydrolysis results in the formation of a hemi - fission membrane state that ultimately results in membrane scis - sion [ 35 ] . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis , which transports a large number of different cargoes from the plasma membrane into the cell , plays an important role in maintaining cell membrane homeostasis and regulating intercellular signaling . The protein components of cla - thrin coatings bind to specific binding sites in the cytosolic parts of different transmembrane cargo molecules and recruit them to the region of the plasma membrane to form vesicles . This results in specific cargo enrichment within the forming vesicles . Within the vesicles , cargo - adapter interactions occur via ubiquitination or phosphorylation of the cargo proteins [ 36 ] . Receptor ligands that are internalized through receptor - mediated CME include low - density lipoprotein , transferrin , growth factor , G - protein , tyrosine kinase receptors and insulin [ 36 ] . Nanomaterials such as Ag and TiO 2 na - noparticles are also internalized by the endocytic pathways medi - ated by clathrin [ 37 , 38 ] . Caveolae - mediated endocytosis This is a clathrin - independent , receptor - mediated endocytosis pathway that involves the participation of 50 – 60 nm diameter , bulb - shaped plasma membrane invaginations known as caveolae ( little caves ) [ 39 ] . Caveolae are abundant in endothelial cells , adipocytes , fibroblasts and muscle cells . They are a subset of caveolin - containing lipid rafts , the latter being dynamic cholesterol - and sphingolipid - rich plasma membrane microdomains in which cellular processes such as endocytosis and signal transduction are compartmenta - lized [ 40 ] . Formation of caveolae is driven by integral membrane proteins known as caveolins as well as peripheral membrane proteins known as cavins ( Fig . 2a ) [ 41 ] . Caveolins such as caveolin - 1 are proteins essential for the biogenesis of caveolae [ 42 ] . Cavins form homo - or hetero - oligomers with each other and account for membrane cur - vature [ 43 ] . The caveolae endocytic machinery also include proteins such as dynamins that are necessary for vesicle scission [ 44 ] . Caveolae - mediated endocytosis is involved in cellular signaling and regulation of membrane proteins , lipids and fatty acids [ 45 ] . Caveolae are dynamic endocytic carriers ; they bud off from the plasma membrane during caveolae - mediated endocytosis [ 41 ] . Ca - veolae budding is mediated by dynamin while Epsl5 - homology do - main - containing protein 2 ( EHD2 ) , a dynamin - related ATPase , negatively regulates caveolar endocytosis [ 46 ] . Endocytosis com - mences with tyrosine phosphorylation of the associated protein , P . Makvandi , M . Chen , R . Sartorius et al . Nano Today 40 ( 2021 ) 101279 3 Fig . 1 . a . Overview of phagocytic and non - phagocytic pathways . i ) Phagocytosis occurs through an actin - based mechanism that involves interaction with specific cell surface receptors . Opsonin - coated nanoparticles are internalized into phagosomes . Fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes produces phagolysosomes , within which foreign particles such as bacteria are degraded by lysozymes ( glycoside hydrolases ) . ii ) Clathrin - mediated endocytosis involves the formation of vesicles from the clathrin - coated regions of the plasma membrane . The ingested material moves from the early endosome to the late endosome , and finally fuses with a lysosome to form a lysosome - endosome hybrid . These substances are subsequently degraded within the intravesicular low pH and enzyme - rich environment . iii ) Caveolae - mediated endocytosis involves internalization by caveolin - enriched invaginations . The caveolar vesicle transfers its contents to an endosome , forming a caveosome that evades lysosomal fusion and digestion . The caveosome is transported along the cytoskeleton to the endoplasmic reticulum / Golgi complex . iv ) Macropinocytosis is a pathway independent of clathrin and caveolin . A pseudopodium protrudes through the plasma membrane driven by actin filaments , forming a macropinosome . The contents are degraded after fusion with lysosomes ( modified from [ 53 ] with permission from Springer ) , b .

Some of the caveolae attempt to fuse with the plasma membrane , but most reach the early endosome before recycling back to the plasma membrane . Caveosomes are late endosomes modified by overexpression of caveolin . The cell cytoskeleton plays an important role in caveolar organization and trafficking . Actin stress fibers affect the linear distribution of many types of caveolae in the plasma membrane . The actin binding protein filamin A also plays a key role in trafficking of caveolae connected to the actin .

The cy - toskeleton plays an important role in the organization and traf - ficking of caveolae . Actin stress fibers affect the linear distribution of caveolae along the plasma membrane [ 47 ] . Regulation of actin and microtubular components of the cytoskeleton is crucial for the in - ternalization and circulation of caveolae [ 48 ] . Caveolins play a vital role in triggering the invagination of plasma membrane . Substance internalized via caveolae - mediated en - docytosis is susceptible to opportunistic escape via lysosomal de - gradation . Such a property has been harnessed for gene or protein delivery [ 49 ] . Caveolin vesicles fuse to form multi - caveolar struc - tures called caveosomes . Caveosomes are capable of evading lyso - somes , thereby protecting the contents from lysosomal degradation . Such a mechanism is utilized by viruses to prevent degradation by lysosomal enzymes [ 50 , 51 ] . Clathrin - and - caveolae - independent endocytosis Clathrin - and - caveolae - independent endocytosis ( CIE ) is medi - ated by flotillins , ADP - ribosylation factor 6 ( Arf6 ) , endophilins or tubular structures known as clathrin - independent vectors . Depending on the effectors , CIE pathways are presently classified as flotillin - dependent , Arf6 - dependent , RhoA - dependent , Cdc42 - de - pendent , clathrin - independent carrier / glycosylphosphatidylinositol - anchored protein ( GPI - AP ) - enriched early endosomal compartments ( CLIC / GEEC ) endocytic pathway and micropinocytosis [ 52 ] . These pathways appear to require specific lipid compositions and are de - pendent on cholesterol . The CIE pathways occur nonspecifically without the need for receptors . They may be further divided into dynamin - independent and dynamin - dependent pathways , with most of the pathways being dynamin - independent . The CIE pathway is utilized by extracellular fluid , growth hor - mones , interleukin - 2 and GPI - APs to enter cells . The mechanisms involved in CIE pathways are still under intense debate . Except for the CLIC / GEEG pathway and macropinocytosis , other CIE pathways do not contribute significantly to the intracellular uptake of nano - particles and biovectors and will not be elaborated further . The CLIC / GEEC pathway is mediated by uncoated tubulovesicular primary carriers known as clathrin - independent carriers ( CLICs ) . These carriers are derived from the plasma membrane and subse - quently mature into tubular early endocytic compartments known as GPI - AP enriched early endosomal compartments ( GEECs ) . The GEECs are routed to the endosomes for fusion with lysosomes . This pathway is responsible for the uptake of fluid , transmembrane proteins , toxin subunits as well as some types of viruses [ 41 , 53 ] . Macropinocytosis is a type of clathrin - and caveolae - independent pinocytosis in which cells take in a large volume of extracellular fluid by forming a 0 . 5 – 10 µm diameter vesicle known as the macropino - some [ 53 ] . The macropinocytosis pathway can internalize micron - sized nanomaterials which cannot be uptaken by other pathways . Nanomaterials in the extracellular fluids are encapsulated inside macropinosomes via nonspecific extracellular fluid uptake [ 53 ] . Phagocytosis Phagocytosis is a complex process responsible for the elimination of pathogens and apoptotic cells . This process is the basis of tissue homeostasis [ 54 ] . Phagocytosis may be divided into four stages : identification of target particles , signaling that activates inter - nalization mechanisms , phagosome formation and phagolysosome maturation [ 55 ] . Phagocytosis involves the recognition and uptake of particles larger than 0 . 5 µm into plasma membrane - derived vesicles known as phagosomes . The process requires the participation of the cytoskeleton in membrane rearrangement [ 56 ] . Specialized phago - cytes of the immune system , including neutrophils , macrophages , monocytes and dendritic cells , utilize this process to internalize invading organisms , pathogens , dead cells and debris [ 57 ] . Other cells such as endothelial cells , epithelial cells and fibroblasts also undergo phagocytosis . Phagocytes have to recognize a large number of different foreign particles . Receptors present on the plasma membrane of these phagocytes may be divided into non - opsonic receptors and opsonic receptors [ 58 ] . Non - opsonic receptors directly recognize molecular groups on the surface of phagocytic targets . Opsonic receptors re - cognize host - derived opsonins , which bind to foreign particles such as bacteria , enabling them to be recognized . After identifying the target particles , the receptors activate a signaling cascade to reshape the membrane lipids and regulate the actin cytoskeleton to expand the peripheral membrane to surround the particles . Membrane re - modeling and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton result in the formation of pseudopodia . After surrounding the target particle , the pseudopodia close at the end to produce a phagosome . In the final stage of phagocytosis , the phagosome fuses with a lysosome and becomes a phagolysosome . The ingested particle is digested by hy - drolases derived from the lysosome . Phagosome maturation involves continuous fusion and fission interactions between the early endo - somes ( aka sorting endosomes ) , late endosomes and finally , the ly - sosomes ( Fig . 2b ) . The phagolysosome contains a highly acidic degradation environment with complex mechanisms for the direct elimination and degradation of microorganisms [ 59 ] . Both abiotic nanomaterials and nanobiovectors penetrate cells through endocytic pathways . Despite the similarity of these mate - rials and biovectors in utilizing endocytosis for cell entry , there are subtle differences among them . The majority of nanoparticles , owing to their positive charge , can interact with negatively - charged cell membranes to penetrate into cells through invaginations and en - gulfments . Penetration of nanostructures into cells through re - ceptor - mediated endocytosis occurs after their surfaces are modified by specific ligands . However , viruses penetrate cells predominantly through receptor - mediated endocytosis , by binding to specific pro - teins on the cell membrane . Furthermore , viruses can use un - common forms of endocytosis that are dependent on actin cytoskeleton reorganization . Cells and the surrounding microenvironment Diverse cell types Cellular uptake of nanomaterials involves highly - regulated me - chanisms via the interaction of complex biomolecules with ligands present on the nanomaterial surface . It is important to understand how nanomaterials enter cells because the uptake pathways in - volved determine their intracellular fate as well as the biological responses of the cells to their ingress [ 60 ] . Nanomaterials circulating in the bloodstream are internalized into many types of cells . The plasma membrane is a selectively - permeable membrane used for transporting substances that are necessary to sustain cell life . Sub - stances obligatory for cell survival such as ions and proteins pass through the lipid bilayer through specific membrane transporter channels . The plasma membrane of a cell chooses its endocytosis pathway according to the size , shape and surface chemistry of the nanomaterials . Examples of nanomaterial ingress into specific cell types will be elaborated below . Table 1 represents examples of cell lines that are affected by endocytosis pathways . Fibroblasts A quantitative model has been developed to correlate the rate of endocytosis with the geometry of nanomaterials . The model sug - gests that nanomaterials aggregate on the cell membrane to reach a size that generates large enough enthalpy through receptor - ligand interaction to overcome the elastic energy and entropy barriers as - sociated with vesicle formation .

Makvandi , M . Chen , R . Sartorius et al . Nano Today 40 ( 2021 ) 101279 7 nanoparticles by “Medical Research Council cell strain - 5” fibroblasts was studied using endocytosis inhibitors . Fibroblasts treated with concanavalin A and chlorpromazine , inhibitors of clathrin - mediated endocytosis , demonstrated significant decrease in Au nanoparticle uptake . The results pointed to the involvement of this endocytic pathway in the uptake of Au nanoparticles [ 61 ] . Self - assembled glycol chitosan nanoparticles are a useful plat - form for drug delivery to targeted cell types . The mechanism of in - tracellular delivery of chitosan nanoparticles to human lung fibroblasts was examined in the presence of type I collagen matrix . The lung fibroblasts were pretreated with chlorpromazine to inhibit clathrin - mediated endocytosis , genistein to inhibit caveolae - medi - ated endocytosis and amiloride to inhibit macropinocytosis . Amiloride pretreatment significantly reduced the uptake of chitosan nanoparticles by the fibroblasts . The results indicated that in - tracellular uptake of chitosan nanoparticles by lung proceeded pre - dominantly via macropinocytosis in response to a collagen - rich extracellular matrix . The chitosan nanoparticles were found to be useful as a drug delivery system for targeting fibrotic lung fibroblasts in the treatment of potentially fatal lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [ 62 ] . Dexamethasone , a glucocorticoid that inhibits inflammation , has been used extensively for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis , osteoarthritis and patients with severe COVID - 19 symptoms . Nevertheless , prolonged use of high - doses of dexamethasone pro - duces severe adverse effects such as adrenal insufficiency , hy - perglycemia and osteoporosis . To circumvent this problem , dexamethasone has been conjugated to polyethylene glycol - coated carbon nanotubes for the suppression of human arthritis synovial fibroblast inflammation . This was achieved by increasing caveolae - mediated endocytosis of the synovial fibroblasts and preventing mitochondrial disruption by recovery of their mitochondrial mem - brane potential . With the use of this experimental low - dose gluco - corticoid - releasing system , there was greater uptake by the fibroblasts and more efficient intracellular release of dexamethasone from intracellular endosomes [ 63 ] . Epithelial cells / endothelial cells Human body organs are composed of four basic tissue types : epithelial , connective , muscular and nervous tissues . Epithelium may be divided into two major groups : covering ( or lining ) epithe - lium and secretory ( glandular ) epithelium . Covering epithelia are organized into one or more layers that cover the surface or line the cavities of an organ . Common types of covering epithelia are simple epithelium , stratified epithelium and pseudo - stratified epithelium . Examples of simple epithelium are lining of blood vessels ( en - dothelium ) and serous lining of cavities ( pericardium , pleura and peritoneum ) . Epithelial cells cover both the inner and outer surfaces of internal organs while endothelial cells cover the inner surfaces of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels [ 64 ] . The clinical applications of nanomaterials invariably require their crossing over the epithelial cell barrier . The transport mechanism of nanoparticles through epithelial cells is dynamic and is significantly influenced by the adhesion pattern of nanoparticles on the cell membrane [ 65 ] . Sys - temically - administered nanoparticles enter endothelial cells via ca - veolae formation and cross the endothelium by transcytosis , a type of transcellular transport in which macromolecules are transported across the interior of a cell . Macromolecules are captured in vesicles on one side of the cell , drawn across the cell , and ejected on the other side via exocytosis . This caveolae - based shuttle mechanism transports nanoparticles and their payloads actively across the en - dothelial barrier . The mechanism also improves the efficacy of de - livery of therapeutic nanoparticles and their cargoes to diseased tissues in the body [ 65 ] . Apart from drug delivery , viral infections are clinically relevant examples of the passage of nanoscopical biovectors through the epithelial barrier . This is exemplified by the diversity of endocytic pathways that SARS - CoV - 2 , the coronavirus responsible for the COVID - 19 pandemic , uses to enter the human lung epithelium . Current evidence suggests that the entry mode of coronavirus varies with the types of virus and host cells . These pathways include CME , caveolae - mediated endocytosis , as well as clathrin - and - caveolae - independent endocytosis that involves lipid rafts [ 66 , 67 ] . In cultured cell lines , entry of both SARS - CoV and SARS - CoV - 2 into the cultured cells appear to involve endocytosis . Endocytosis of SARS - CoV pro - ceeds through a variety of pathways depending on the cell line [ 68 ] . A large number of endocytic markers are expressed in nasal epi - thelial cells , indicating the existence of multiple active pathways [ 69 ] . In contrast , pneumocytes , the surface epithelial cells of the alveoli , show more limited expression patterns , with low or null expression of some of the key proteins associated with traditional endocytosis . More importantly , large GTPase dynamin , which is re - quired for the scission of clathrin - coated vesicles and caveolae , is present in large numbers in the nasal epithelium but is not detect - able in pneumocytes . Proteins associated with macropinocytosis , such as C - terminal binding protein ( CtBP ) - 1 , CtBP - 2 , and p21 acti - vated kinase 1 , are expressed at medium to high levels . Accordingly , macropinocytosis may be an important pathway for endocytosis by pneumocytes [ 12 ] . The observation that macropinocytosis in al - veolar epithelial cell lines is upregulated by water - pipe smoke condensate suggests potential association of COVID - 19 morbidity with smoking [ 70 ] . Identification of the endocytic route of SARS - COV - 2 in primary pulmonary epithelial cells has significant trans - lational implications . Specifically , establishment of a cell - based SARS - CoV - 2 infection model will contribute to the establishment of drug development and screening platforms aiming at identifying compounds that can block or hinder the SARS - CoV - 2 endocytic pathway ( Fig . 3 ) [ 71 , 72 ] . Mesenchymal stem cells Stem cells provide the ammunition for the flourish of con - temporary regenerative medicine . The most well - studied sub - population of pluripotent stem cells is the mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC ) . The MSCs can differentiate into mesoderm - derived bone , cartilage , adipose tissue and muscle tissue [ 73 ] . A nanoscopical core - shell contrasting agent was synthesized for magnetic resonance imaging using perfluorooctyl bromide as core , poly ( lactic - co - glycolic acid ) as shell and a polystyrene sulfonate surface coating . These hybrid nanoparticles were internalized by MSCs via caveolae - mediated endocytosis without adversely affecting cell proliferation and their subsequent differentiation into osteoblasts [ 74 ] . Mesenchymal stem cells have an inherent migratory capacity toward tumorous tissues in vivo . Capitalizing on this inherent tumor - homing characteristic , engineered MSCs may be used as vectors for delivering diagnostic and therapeutic nanoparticles into a tumor . For example , 4 nm - diameter Au nanoparticles have been fed to MSCs and uptaken via endocytosis . These engineered MSCs act as contrasting agents in magnetic resonance imaging for tracking tu - mors via homing of the Au nanoparticle - containing MSCs in vivo [ 75 ] . Similarly , carboxyl - coated fluorescent quantum dots have been fed into human skin MSCs via clathrin - mediated endocytosis for long - term fluorescence imaging of tumors [ 76 ] . With respect to therapeutics , DNA or RNA gene vectors may be encapsulated and protected from degradation by nanoscopical li - posomes and delivered to MSCs via different endocytic pathways [ 77 ] . Polymeric nanoparticles such as polyethyleneimine may also be used for gene delivery into stem cells . Genetically - engineered MSCs that contain pro - angiogenic and anti - apoptotic genes provide the basis for stem cell - based cardiac repair in ischemic heart diseases by improving angiogenesis , relieving ventricular remodeling and en - hancing overall heart function [ 78 ] . The processes involved in P . Makvandi , M . Chen , R . Sartorius et al . Nano Today 40 ( 2021 ) 101279 8 nanoparticle - based gene transfer into stem cells are summarized in Fig . 4 . Macrophages Surgical implantation of nanomaterials initiates a series of cel - lular and biochemical events that ultimately determine the quality of their integration within the human body . Macrophages play a key role in these events by regulating the body’s immune response during inflammation and healing . Macrophages are derived from monocytes and are distributed throughout the body . They function as janitor cells ( for engulfing dead cells , microbes and foreign ma - terials ) as well as antigen - presenting cells [ 78 ] . Hyperfunction or dysfunction of macrophages has been linked to the pathogenesis of diseases such as osteoporosis , rheumatism , ar - teriosclerosis and tumors . Specific macrophages known as tumor - associated macrophages are found in tumors . For treating these diseases , macrophage - targeting drug delivery systems have been developed by utilizing receptors on the surface of macrophages as cellular targets . Because all conventional drug delivery nanocarriers reply on endocytosis for entering target cells , it is necessary to de - velop phagocytosis - inducing nanocarriers for faster and more effi - cient drug internalization in macrophages . A macrophage - targeting , phagocytosis - inducing bio - nanocapsule - based nanocarrier has been developed . These nanocarriers consisted of a hepatitis B virus - en - veloped particle outwardly displaying protein G - derived IgG Fc - binding domains and protein L - derived IgG Fab - binding domains in tandem . This enables the nanocarriers to aggregate and trigger phagocytosis in macrophages . When the nanocarriers are fused with liposomes , they may be used to deliver drugs to the targeted macrophages for treating diseases associated with these defense cells [ 79 ] . A major obstacle to gene transfer in vivo is its uptake process . Lysosomal degradation of the genetic material ultimately results in their extracellular excretion . Nanosystems that have the capacity to bypass endocytosis are highly - esteemed for gene transfer . For ex - ample , porous silicon nanoparticles that contain an outer sheath of homing peptides and fusion liposomes ( fusogenic pSi nanoparticles ) selectively target macrophages and directly introduce the oligonu - cleotide payload into the cytosol of macrophages via direct mem - brane fusion with the liposomes , thereby evading endocytosis and vesicular fusion with lysosomes ( Fig . 5 ) [ 80 ] . Introduction of the small interfering RNA oligonucleotide into the macrophages en - hances their clearance capability and improves their survival in a murine pneumonia model caused by Staphylococcus aureus . The interface between cell surface and nanomaterials profoundly affects the interaction between the two entities , and even de - termines cell fate . When graphene is introduced into the human body , they are recognized as “foreign” and are uptaken by macro - phages for removal . This adversely affects the biomedical applic - ability of graphene and graphene oxide ( GO ) . To address this issue , the surface of carboxylated nanographene oxide complexes ( nGO ) were decorated with polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) , bovine serum al - bumin ( BSA ) or polyetherimide ( PEI ) ( Fig . 6a ) , to examine the effects of surface chemistry on their uptake by macrophages . Compared with highly negative charged pristine nGO , reduced negative zeta - potentials were recorded for PEG - decorated nGO ( nGO - PEG ) and BSA - decorated nGO ( nGO - BSA ) . These two surface modifications inhibited endocytosis of the surface - decorated nGOs by macro - phages . The inhibitory effect was more effective for nGO - PEG , in Fig . 3 . Pathogenesis of coronavirus infections . Abbreviations – ACE2 : Angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 cell - surface receptor ; CoV : coronavirus ; DPP - 4 : dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 cell - surface receptor ; MERS : middle east respiratory syndrome ; SARS : severe acute respiratory syndrome [ 72 ] . P . Makvandi , M . Chen , R . Sartorius et al . Nano Today 40 ( 2021 ) 101279 9 which endocytosis was almost completely halted . In contrast , modification of nGO by PEI created a two - dimensional surface with positive zeta potential , which facilitated endocytosis . Macrophage viability was reduced after uptake of nGO - PEI because of their electrostatic interaction with mitochondria within the macrophages . Release of reactive oxygen species and cytochrome C by the mi - tochondria further activated the caspase cascade , ultimately re - sulting in apoptosis of the macrophages ( Fig . 6b ) [ 81 ] . The results indicate that the interaction of graphene oxide with macrophages may be tuned by surface functionalization to dampen their removal by these patrolling janitor cells . Local environmental effects Endocytosis may be driven by nonspecific interactions when the nanoparticles do not bind to specific cell surface receptors . Substrate stiffness plays an important role in changing the cellular uptake pattern of nanoparticles . The regulatory effect of substrate stiffness and morphology on cell uptake may be attributed to the change in cell membrane mechanical properties and cell diffusion area [ 95 ] . Studies in mechanical biology have demonstrated that various local physical cues regulate cellular responses , resulting in changes in cellular morphology and surface mechanics that , in turn , influence cellular uptake of nanoparticles [ 96 ] . Cell uptake increases linearly with cell membrane surface area because it represents the area as - sessable to the nanoparticles . Cell surface area is the predominant factor that governs membrane tension . Hence , absorption of each cell escalates with increase in matrix stiffness [ 97 ] . Mechanosensing induction refers to the ability of a cell to sense mechanical signals in its microenvironment . These signals include not only all components of force , stress and strain , but also rigidity , topological structure and adhesion . This ability is crucial for cells to respond to mechanical cues around them and to adapt to changing environments . Examples of response and adaptation include cell ( de ) activation , proliferation / apoptosis and ( de ) differentiation . Receptor - mediated cellular me - chanical induction is a multi - step process that commences with binding of cell surface receptors to the extracellular matrix or to li - gands on adjacent cell surfaces . Mechanical cues are provided by ligands and received by receptors at the binding surface [ 98 ] . Another issue to be considered is the sedimentation effect . Aggregation and deposition of nanomaterials involve diffusion and Brownian movement , which causes variations in the concentration of nanomaterials along the cell surface [ 99 ] . Although static cell culture is extensively used in in vitro studies , the study of nano - particle - cell interactions under dynamic flow conditions is more appropriate in simulating in vivo conditions . Anisotropic nanoma - terials such as polymer worms can be stretched and undergo mor - phological rearrangement under dynamic flow . Strong hydrodynamic shear may disrupt the interaction between na - noscopical cylinders and the cell surface and reduce the chance of cell uptake . In contrast , cell uptake of spherical nanomaterials is less affected by dynamic fluids [ 100 ] . Fig . 4 .

Nano Today 40 ( 2021 ) 101279 10 Attributes of man - made nanomaterial that affect endocytosis An important facet in the medical application of nanomaterials is the correlation between the physicochemical properties of these materials and endocytosis . Size , shape and the type of surface functional groups are the three most important attributes that in - fluence endocytosis , which will be highlighted first prior to discuss other attributes . Table 2 represents the impact of nanomaterials properties on the internalization mechanism . Size and agglomeration Internalization of nanostructures into cells significantly depends on their size . Many of the properties of nanoparticles in the human body such as lifetime , targeting potential , cell internalization and clearance from the body are dependent on their size . There has been considerable efforts in determining the optimal size of nanostructures for internalization . The latter has important implications in the field of targeted drug delivery . In receptor - mediated endocytosis , complete encapsulation of a nanoparticle depends on sufficient adhesion strength and ligand density to cross the energy barrier . The forward tracking diffusion model shows that the time required for nanoparticle internalization is closely related to its size [ 124 ] . The effect of size varies for nanomaterials of different shapes , in terms of the quantity of uptaken nanoparticles and the en - docytosis mechanism . For example , small graphene oxide na - nosheets ( ~ 200 nm ) enter cells via CME while bigger sheets ( ~ 1 µm ) are uptaken by phagocytosis [ 125 ] . The endocytosis me - chanism is also affected by size . For instance , nanoparticles with size around 125 nm are uptaken by cells via CME [ 126 ] . Another study investigated the relationship between arginine - terminated Au nanoparticles of different sizes and the method of uptake ( Fig . 7a ) . Gold nanoparticles with size less than 10 nm underwent energy - independent direct membrane penetration . The cellular uptake strategy was altered as the size of the nanoparticles in - creased from 10 nm ; the larger arginine - terminated Au nano - particles penetrated cells through energy - dependent endocytosis ( Fig . 7b ) [ 127 ] . Likewise , small carboxylated polystyrene nano - particles were uptaken into cells via CME , whereas larger nano - particles were uptaken via caveolae - mediated endocytosis ( Fig . 7c ) [ 128 ] . Increase in size reduces the level of internalization of nanoparticles by endocytosis . Loading cargoes on nanoparticles increases their particle size , which may result in alteration of their endocytosis mechanism . This effect should be taken into con - sideration during gene or drug delivery [ 129 ] . In addition , nano - particles with larger sizes demonstrate agglomeration , which adversely interferes with endocytosis [ 130 ] . The size of nanomaterials affects their toxicity [ 131 ] . The size and polydispersity of nanoarchitectures increase as they aggregate in biological solutions . Aggregation of nanoparticles before entering a cell affects their internalization . For accurate assessment of the as - sociation between nanostructure size and endocytosis , it is im - perative that the colloidal stability of the nanoparticles is tested to ascertain that they remain solitary in the biological medium prior to cell entry [ 130 ] . Usually , the culture medium employed for analyzing endocytosis of nanoparticles is different from the original medium used for the synthesis of nanoparticles . Metal nanoparticles syn - thesized by chemical or green methods may contain salts , surfac - tants , reducing agents , stabilizing agents or organic solvents used for their synthesis . The culture media used for analyzing cell inter - nalization contain proteins instead of the aforementioned chemicals [ 132 ] . This difference may result in aggregation of the nanoparticles , which alter their size range and distribution . The same attributes should be considered for in vivo applications because cells and their surrounding media affect nanoparticle aggregation . Fig . 5 . Fusogenic porous silica nanoparticle system with small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) encapsulated by a liposome with a lipid bilayer and coated with macrophage - specific surface targeting peptides . Because of the similarity in composition between the liposome and the cell membrane of the macrophage , the nanocarriers system can be uptaken by the macrophage via membrane fusion without undergoing endocytosis and vesicular formation . After cell entry , dissociation of the core complex of the fusogenic nanoparticle releases the gene transfer material directly into the cytoplasm and evading vesicular fusion and degradation by the intracellular lysosomes . The remnant calcium silicate porous nanoparticle undergoes degradation within the cell . Abbreviations – PEG : polyethylene glycol ; pSi : porous silica .

Nano Today 40 ( 2021 ) 101279 11 Shape Studying the effect of nanoparticle shape on the mechanism of internalization is challenging because of different confounding fac - tors . First , changes in shape can also affect the size of nanomaterials . Second , non - spherical objects can interact with cell membranes in different directions . The contact area between the nanoparticle and the cell surface differs , depending on the direction of interaction with the cell membrane [ 133 ] . The shape of nanoparticles as well as their angle of entry determine the mechanism of endocytosis [ 134 ] . There is increasing evidence showing that spherical nano - particles have higher cellular uptake compared with rod - shaped nanoparticles [ 26 , 135 , 136 ] . For example , spherical Au nanoparticles were more readily uptaken by HeLa cells than rod - shaped Au na - noparticles [ 135 ] . This is probably attributed to the longer time re - quired for membrane wrapping of rod - shaped nanoparticles , as well as absorption of surfactant molecules to the longitudinal axis of the rod - shaped nanoparticles [ 136 ] . For rod - shaped nanoparticles , cel - lular uptake via endocytosis is more profuse for shorter nano - particles than longer nanoparticles [ 114 ] . The uptake of Au nanospheres , nanostars and nanorods of different sizes was in - vestigated in an in vitro study ( Fig . 8 ) [ 137 ] . The quantity of all three sizes of nanospheres uptaken by different cell lines exceeded those of nanostars and nanorods . In addition , Au nanospheres and na - norods were predominantly uptaken via CME , while Au nanostars were uptaken by both CME and caveolae - mediated endocytosis . Another study reported that Au nanotriangles had higher cellular uptake than Au nanorods and Au nanostars . Gold nanotriangles were uptaken via micropinocytosis whereas Au nanorods were inter - nalized through caveolae / lipid raft - mediated endocytosis [ 138 ] . These results indicate that even for the same material ( Au ) , different endocytosis mechanisms are involved in the uptake of nanomater - ials with different shapes . Similar to metal nanoparticles , carbon nanomaterials also de - monstrate shape - dependent cellular uptake [ 139 ] . Although CME is the major pathway for uptake of carbon nanomaterials , caveolae - mediated endocytosis and micropinocytosis are also involved in their cellular uptake [ 140 ] . For single - walled carbon nanotubes , the endocytosis mechanisms responsible for their uptake are in the as - cending order : micropinocytosis , caveolae - mediated endocytosis and CME [ 141 ] . Surface functional groups and charge Apart from the size and shape , functional groups and charge also determine cellular uptake of nanostructures . Positively - charged na - nomaterials demonstrate higher cellular intake than their neutral or negatively - charged counterparts due to interaction of the positively - charged entities with negatively - charged plasma membranes . Indeed , changing the surface charge from zwitterionic to positive charge in a tumor microenvironment improves internalization of Au nanoparticles into cancerous cells [ 142 , 143 ] . An experiment was conducted to examine the cellular intake of Au nanoparticles with different surface functionalities . The findings indicate that changing the surface charge from zwitterionic to positive charge in a weakly acidic pH such as that present in the tumor microenvironment im - proves internalization of Au nanoparticles by HeLa and HMEC - 1 cells ( Fig . 9 ) [ 143 ] . Functionalization of nanomaterials with biomolecules such as genes or drugs causes increase in their particle size . Although large particle size adversely affects nanoparticle internalization and en - docytosis , it has been observed that drug - or gene - decorated nano - devices have better cellular uptake . This disparity indicates that size is not the only factor that influences nanostructure internalization ; other attributes also play significant roles . Surface charge is one of those attributes . Although increase in size reduces internalization , charge has the opposite effect . Increased surface charge , either po - sitive or negative , improves nanoparticle internalization . This is due to increase in the interaction between the nanoparticles and the plasma membrane . Recently , Au nanoparticles have been examined for experimental delivery of oligonucleotides across brain en - dothelial cells . Addition of oligonucleotides increases the size of the Au nanoparticles , which is inimical for internalization . The Fig . 6 . a .

Schematic of the different intracellular pathways in a macrophage after exposure to different nGO complexes . Pristine 2 - D nGO were uptaken by the macrophage via endocytosis . Decoration of nGO with PEG almost completely pre - vented endocytosis . Endocytosis was compromised with nGO - BSA but not as severely as nGO - PEG . Unlike nGO - PEG and nGO - BSA , nGO - PEI were readily uptaken by en - docytosis . However , the uptaken nGO - PEI interacted with mitochondria , causing the latter to release reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and cytochrome C ( Cyto C ) , which , in turn , activated the downstream caspase signaling cascade to induce apoptosis .

Nano Today 40 ( 2021 ) 101279 13 oligonucleotides augment the negative charge of nanoparticles and ameliorate their endocytosis via interacting with positively - charged proteins on the cell surface [ 129 ] . It has to be stressed that this re - presents the ideal conditions ; the result may be different when nanoparticles are exposed to body conditions . This is because ne - gatively - charged Au nanoparticles bind to positively - charged serum proteins that completely alter the overall surface charge of the Au nanoparticles [ 144 ] . Likewise , positively - charged Au nanoparticles can also interact with negatively - charged endothelial glycocalyx or endothelial surface proteins [ 145 , 146 ] . Surface chemical modification is an important step in biomedical applications for reducing cytotoxicity , increasing stability and ex - pediting nanoparticle internalization into cells . Functionalized na - noparticles have better targeting efficacy than non - functionalized nanoparticles . Functionalized nanoparticles have a higher rate of cell uptake , thereby enhancing therapeutic efficacy . Surface coating is a crucial factor that determines cell absorption rate . Surface functio - nalization also determines the endocytosis pathway through which nanomaterials are internalized [ 147 ] . Generally speaking , positively - charged nanomaterials demonstrated higher cellular intake than their neutral or negatively - charged counterparts [ 26 , 143 ] . This phenomenon is possibly due to the better attraction of positively - charged nanomaterials to the negatively - charged cell mem - brane [ 26 ] . Architectures such as nanosheets show more complex behavior than nanospheres or nanorods . To investigate the effect of surface charge , graphene nanosheets were functionalized with positive ( e NH 3 + ) and negative ( e OSO 3− ) charged functionalities . Neutral nanosheets did not have significant uptake while both positively - charged and negatively - charged graphene nanosheets demonstrated Fig . 7 .

Because endocytosis is an energy - dependent process and the major pathway of entrance for extracellular components [ 148 – 150 ] , it is also the predominant strategy for internalization of graphene nanosheets . Large functionalized graphene sheets ( ~ 1 µm ) penetrate cells via phagocytosis regardless of the surface functional groups . In contrast , surface charge is the predominant parameter that influences the internalization of graphene nanosheets that are smaller than 200 nm [ 125 ] . Surface functional groups may also be employed for nanocarriers to deliver therapeutic agents into a designated part of the cell . To reduce endolysosomal accumulation and to increase cytosolic loca - lization , nanocapsules were functionalized with glycoprotein H de - rived from the Herpes simplex virus 1 ( gH625 ) . Emulsions containing curcumin - embedded nanocapsules were directly internalized into the cytosol instead of the lysosomes [ 151 ] . These findings indicate that surface functionalization affects the amount of cellular uptake as well as the fate of nanomaterials inside cells . Incubation of nanoparticles in biological fluids results in devel - opment of a new layer on the nanostructure surface that is known as the protein corona . Accordingly , it is necessary to understand the process of protein corona formation and how it is associated with the uptake of nanoparticles using biological fluids to simulate body conditions . Sixty nanometer pristine Au nanoparticles required minimum time for endocytosis . Formation of a protein corona in - creased the time required for endocytosis . In addition , the presence of a protein corona significantly reduced ligand density on the Au nanostructure surface , resulting in defective engulfment [ 4 ] . Surface alteration is not always a negative factor for cellular uptake of na - noparticles . For example , surface modification of nanoparticles by folic acid ligands promoted their cellular uptake by receptor - medi - ated endocytosis [ 152 ] . Elasticity and stiffness The elasticity of nanoparticles affects their internalization as well as their circulation and biodistribution [ 153 ] . Elasticity refers to a material’s resistance to change under pressure and the capability to return to its native state after pressure is removed [ 97 ] . Stiffness refers to a material’s capacity to resist deformation during applica - tion of a load . E elasticity and stiffness are the intrinsic and extrinsic features of nanostructures . In addition , the geometry of a nanoma - terial , including size and shape , relies on stiffness [ 154 ] . Elasticity and stiffness is the most important mechanical characteristics of nanostructures that can be determined using atomic force micro - scopy . These devices evaluate surface topography by exerting deli - cate forces . The atomic force microscope has minute cantilever beams that touch the surface of nanoparticles via their sharp tip . Displacement of surface relative to cantilever tip is measured by piezoelectric actuators [ 155 ] . Atomic force microscopes are used extensively for determining the stiffness and viscoelasticity of na - noparticles using dynamic mechanical testing principles , generating important information such as the storage modulus , loss modulus and tan delta [ 156 ] . The storage and loss modulus in viscoelastic materials measure the stored energy , representing the elastic por - tion , and the energy dissipated as heat , representing the viscous portion . The ratio of the loss modulus to storage modulus in a vis - coelastic material is defined as the tan delta , which provides a measure of damping in the nanomaterial . Tweaking the elasticity of nanoparticles to enhance their inter - nalization by cells is a valuable tool for nanocargo delivery [ 157 ] . Different strategies for tuning the elasticity of nanoparticles are available , including the use of colloidal microgel / nanohydrogels and layer - by - layer systems [ 153 ] . Altering the cross - linking density is a popular method to control the elasticity of microgels / hydrogels , which affects cellular uptake and uptake kinetics [ 158 ] . For example , microgels with cross - linking densities between 1 . 7 and 15 mol % were internalized into cells through several mechanisms , which result in high uptake rates [ 159 ] . In another study , poly ( N - iso - propylacrylamide ) - based microgels were used to investigate the effects of nanoparticles with different cross - linking densities on interaction with the plasma membrane [ 160 ] Microgels with low cross - linking densities were softer than those with high cross - linking densities . Charged microgels had fast cellular uptake , in the range of seconds to minutes . Microgels that were larger than 800 nm in diameter and had cross - linking densities of 10 – 15 mol % could not be translocated into cells [ 160 ] . Nanoparticle elasticity may also be tuned by controlling the amount of polymer added during synthesis . For example , hydrogels with tunable elastic moduli ( 0 . 255 kPa to 3 MPa ) but uniform size ( ~ 200 nm ) and surface charge ( ~ −35 mV ) were prepared by using different amounts of poly ( ethylene glycol ) diacrylate via a nanoe - mulsion templating method [ 161 ] . Both soft ( 10 kPa ) and hard ( 3 MPa ) nanostructures demonstrated long circulation times with acceptable pharmacokinetics . The hard nanoparticles were phago - cytosed more profusely ( > 3 . 5 times ) by macrophages compared with the soft nanoparticles . The hard nanoparticles remained less in circulation because of their rapid clearance by phagocytic immune cells [ 161 ] . In addition to elasticity , stiffness directly influences the interac - tions between nanomaterials and cells . Several experimental and theoretical studies have recently been conducted to examine the role of stiffness on nanomaterial internalization . To eliminate the effect of nanomaterial physicochemical characteristics such as size and surface features on cell internalization , a two - stage microfluidic chip was developed that is capable of producing a series of core - shell nanoparticles with the same features but with different stiffness . These nanoparticles were exposed to both cancerous and non - can - cerous cells to evaluate the impact of material stiffness on cell in - ternalization . The results showed that rigidity has a significant effect on the uptake of nanoparticles ; the more rigid nanoparticles are more easily uptaken by the cells ( Fig . 10 ) [ 162 ] . Layer - by - layer particles and capsules are carriers with high elasticity that are promising for drug delivery applications . Typically , layer - by - layer particles consist of sequential layers of proteins and polymers , or are separately layered on a sacrificial polymeric or in - organic core surface [ 163 ] . Different approaches may be used to modulate the elasticity of such particles , including controlling the materials used in the layers , the number of layers , the density of layer crosslinking , and removing the core of the capsules [ 164 ] . For example , core - shell particles that consist of a solid polymeric core inside a lipid shell with cylindrical polymer brushes exhibited ex - cellent elasticity [ 165 – 167 ] . Layer - by - layer capsules synthesized using a silica template exhibited increased stiffness values after re - placement of the core with Au nanoparticles [ 168 ] . The stiffness of the capsules was 0 . 183 N / m without replacement of the core by Au nanoparticles . The stiffness of the capsules increased with increases in the concentration of the Au nanoparticles ; stiffness increased to 0 . 259 N / m , 0 . 293 N / m and 1 . 447 N / m , respectively , for low , medium and high loading of Au nanoparticles . In addition , stiffness may be improved by incorporating multiple layers . For example , the stiffness of hyaluronic acid capsules prepared from silica matrices increased from 7 . 5 N / m to ~ 27 . 2 N / m by increasing the layers of hyaluronic acid from one layer to 4 layers [ 169 ] . Likewise , the stiffness of poly ( styrenesulfonate ) / poly ( allylamine hydrochloride ) and dextran sul - fate / poly - L arginine capsules prepared using CaCO 3 cores increased from ~ 0 . 25 to 9 N / m by increasing the number of layers [ 170 ] .

Nano Today 40 ( 2021 ) 101279 17 Other parameters Apart from global physiochemical attributes including size , shape , chemical modification , surface charge and elasticity , other variables such as nanoparticle orientation and energetic interactions also affect cellular uptake [ 171 ] . Coating of a nanostructure by the plasma membrane is modulated by the adhesion energy between the nanocarrier and the plasma membrane , and subsequently by the deformation energy consumed for crossing the lipid bilayer [ 172 ] . Binding occurs when the adhesion strength is high enough to compensate for the deformation energy consumed at the membrane curvature . This attachment transition is continuous without a po - tential energy barrier [ 173 , 174 ] . If the adhesion strength between the nanostructure and the plasma membrane increases , discontinuous binding with a potential energy barrier occurs between two par - tially - wrapped states , or between a completely - wrapped state and a partially - wrapped state . For spherical nanoparticles , the wrapping process is continuous [ 134 ] . The stability of partially - wrapped states , however , increases for nonspherical nanoparticles such as ellipsoidal and spherocylindrical nanoparticles [ 175 – 177 ] . The effect of na - norods and nanocubes with varying aspect ratios and edge curva - tures on membrane wrapping and cell internalization had been investigated [ 178 ] . Nanorods had stable endocytotic states with high wrapping fractions . Increasing their aspect ratio is not conducive to complete wrapping . Nanoparticles with high aspect ratios and round tips enter side - wise via a “submarine” mode , with their long edge parallel to the plasma membrane . Conversely , nanoparticles with small aspect ratios and flat tips enter tip - wise via a “rocket” mode ( Fig . 11a ) . A membrane model was used to theoretically examine the cel - lular interactions of nanoparticles through Brownian dynamics si - mulation [ 179 ] . Uptake of nanoparticles with tilted orientation was non - monotonic , whereas uptake of nanoparticles orientated normal to the membrane was monotonic ( Fig . 11b ) . This phenomenon was attributed to the transition energy between membrane adhesion and nanoparticle kinetics . Table 3 represents some examples of the effect of nanoparticle geometry , size and functional groups on endocytosis . Virus as a biovector nanoparticle Viruses are specialized intracellular parasites that require a host cell to process and propagate their genetic information . Viral nucleic acids are protected by a proteinaceous coat , the capsid , which is composed of repeated units of one or more structural proteins . Enveloped viruses possess an additional lipid membrane comprising viral membrane glycoproteins . The lipid membrane is capable of binding to specific host cell receptors and induces fusion of the virus with the host cell membrane . Some viruses such as paramyxoviruses [ 184 ] and Human Immunodeficiency Virus - 1 ( HIV - 1 ) [ 185 ] are cap - able of entering the host cell cytosol by direct penetration of the plasma membrane . Other viruses capitalize on intracellular en - dosomal vesicles to move through the cytoplasm of the host cell and for routing to other intracellular organelles , gradually sensing the changes in the pH of the environment that are necessary for viral uncoating [ 14 ] . The initial step of virus penetration into the host cell usually begins with the engagement of the structural proteins of the virus to specific host cell receptors , carbohydrates or lipids . Common viral receptors are sialylated glycans , cell adhesion molecules such as selectins , cadherins and integrins , the immunoglobulin superfamily receptors and the phosphatidylserine receptors that include T - cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain ( TIM ) and TYRO3 , AXL , as well as the MER family of receptor tyrosine kinases ( TAMs ) [ 186 ] . Binding of viruses to the host cell surface receptors triggers a series of cel - lular signals that cause the host cell to internalize the viruses through one of the endocytic mechanisms : a ) CME , which is utilized extensively by many viruses ; b ) caveolae / lipid raft - mediated en - docytosis , which may be used as a substitute to or supplement the clathrin route ; c ) macropinocytosis , and d ) a variety of other still poorly - characterized mechanisms ( Fig . 12 ) [ 14 , 187 ] . Dynamin parti - cipates in membrane fission to generate endocytic vesicles and is required for many endocytic pathways . These endocytic pathways may be divided into sub - pathways that are dependent or in - dependent of dynamin . Dynamin - dependent mechanisms include CME , caveolae - mediated endocytosis and clathrin - independent dynamin - mediated pathways . Pathways independent of dynamin encompass macropinocytosis , lipid raft - mediated endocytosis and clathrin - and - caveolae - independent endocytosis [ 188 ] . Usually , viruses do not utilize a single entry mechanism into the host cell . They utilize multiple uptake routes , depending on the host cell and virus size and shape ( Table 4 ) . Clathrin - mediated pathway The CME route is the most common endocytic pathway taken by small and medium - sized viruses . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is also largely exploited in biomedical applications such as targeted - drug delivery and diagnostic imaging , to deliver ligand - coated na - noparticles to diseased cells and tissues [ 16 , 212 , 213 ] . Clathrin - mediated virus internalization commences with the binding of vir - ions to host receptors . The subsequent signals mediated by the re - ceptors induce the binding of adapter proteins to the cytoplasmic tail Fig . 10 .

Clathrin proteins are recruited and their binding to adapter proteins induces clathrin multimerization and invagination of a clathrin - coated pit . The GTPase dynamin - 1 mediates scission of the vesicles and releases the clathrin - coated vesicles to the cytosol [ 28 ] . Viruses are delivered to early endosomes and other in - tracellular organelles by vesicular transport through the cytoplasm for fusion with endosomes . The vesicular stomatitis rhabdovirus ( VSV ) uses CME to infect human cells . The endocytic receptor for VSV belongs to the low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) receptor family . Mutations of LDL receptors abolish VSV infectivity [ 189 ] . Because VSV is used extensively as a vector for gene therapy and oncolytic viral therapy , this finding is useful for the design of recombinant viruses with modified tropism for biomedical virus retargeting [ 214 , 215 ] . Although many components of CME have been well character - ized , other factors remain unidentified . Proteins involved in the entry of large cargoes such as viruses are still largely unknown . Flaviviruses are a large group of viruses responsible for the emer - gence and re - emergence of mosquito - borne tropical diseases such as Dengue , Zika or West Nile Virus diseases . Flaviviruses utilize CME as an internalization route into the host cell . A conserved domain in the glycoprotein E of the flavivirus envelope is responsible for virus re - ceptor - mediated binding and viral entry into the host cell [ 216 ] . Despite the similarity with E protein , the binding receptor exhibits differences among different cell types . Dengue virus employs several cell membrane receptors for cell entry . Carbohydrate molecules such as glycosaminoglycans , glycosphingolipids , heat shock proteins and C - type lectin receptors such as mannose receptor and DC - SIGN have been reported as Dengue receptors [ 190 , 191 ] . Unlike small en - dogenous cargoes such as transferrin , flaviviruses entry is promoted by the small interferon - inducible glycosylphosphatidylinositol - an - chored lymphocyte antigen 6E ( LY6E ) . Large - cargo internalization requires substantial changes in the microtubule compartment of the host cell cytosol . Viral infection promotes the formation of LY6E tubule - like structures that are dependent on ribonuclease K and microtubule end - binding proteins [ 217 , 218 ] . The involvement of LY6E in enhancing virus entry has also been shown for other viruses such as HIV - 1 [ 219 ] , influenza A virus , measles virus , VSV [ 220 ] and hepatitis B virus [ 221 ] . Influenza A viruses utilize different endocytosis pathways for cell entry , depending on cell type : CME and dynamin - independent mi - cropinocytosis [ 192 ] . The influenza A virus uses its major surface glycoprotein , hemagglutinin , to bind to different sialylated receptors on the host cell surface , including the sialic acid - containing , voltage - dependent Ca 2 + Cav1 . 2 channels [ 222 ] . This multivalent attachment by multiple copies of trimeric hemagglutinin triggers endocytosis of the influenza virus , which is eventually transported to the endo - some . Acidification of the lumen during endosome maturation in - duces conformational changes in the hemagglutinin receptors . This , in turn , causes membrane fusion and release of the virus genome and viral proteins into the host cell cytoplasm ( Fig . 13 ) . Mutations in the sequence of the hemagglutinin receptor binding domain confer specificity for binding to different types of sialic acids . This helps to regulate species - specific tropism of the influenza family of viruses [ 223 ] . Virus - mimetic nanomaterials such as therapeutic nano - particles can benefit from the hemagglutinin - mediated entry me - chanism of influenza A virus to improve the ability of nanoparticles to be recognized by target cells , with higher specificity [ 224 ] . Caveolae - mediated pathway Caveolae are lipid rafts that produce flask - shaped plasma mem - brane invaginations enriched in cholesterol , phospholipids and sphingolipids [ 225 ] . The major components of caveolae are caveolins Fig . 11 . a . Possible modes of nanostructure uptake by membrane wrapping : ( i ) submarine mode with the longitudinal axis of the nanoparticles oriented parallel to the membrane , ( ii ) rocket mode with the longitudinal axis oriented perpendicular to the membrane , and ( iii ) competition between the submarine mode and the rocket mode as observed for rod - like particles with high aspect ratios .

Makvandi , M . Chen , R . Sartorius et al . Nano Today 40 ( 2021 ) 101279 20 and cavins ( refer to Section 3 ) . Binding of the virus to their host cell surface receptors results in dynamin - 2 mediated caveosome formation , endocytosis of the cargo and its transport to the early endosomes [ 226 ] . Many enveloped and non - enveloped viruses such as SV40 and other polyomaviruses utilize caveolae - mediated endocytosis to in - fect host cells . Entry of the non - enveloped SV40 virus is mediated by its binding to major histocompatibility complex class I ( MHC - I ) molecules that are ubiquitous on the host cell surface . The SV40 – MHC - I complexes then migrate to caveolin pits , where the MHC - I molecules are released and subsequently degraded . The pentamers of the major SV40 capsid protein subsequently bind ganglioside GM1 molecules , which represent the endocytic receptor for the virus . Binding of SV40 particles to GM1 induces the caveolin - 1 mediated invaginations that eventually produce caveolae and trigger virus endocytosis ( Fig . 14 ) [ 193 , 194 ] . Polyomaviruses use different sialylated glycans as receptors for cell entry . Experi - mental complex formation between different polyomavirus VP1 proteins and sialylated glycan receptors showed that VP1 proteins are highly specific for their respective glycan receptors . This affinity modulates virus uptake , tropism and pathogenesis [ 227 ] . Many enveloped viruses utilize caveolae - mediated endocytosis as an alternative route for cell entry . The route of entry of the ZIKA virus , an arthropod - borne virus causing neurological disorders and microcephaly in human infants , has recently been characterized in glioblastoma cells [ 195 ] . Although the majority of the ZIKA virus employed clathrin vesicles to reach the cytosol of host cells , virus infection was dramatically reduced by siRNA knockdown or Fig . 12 . Mechanisms of virus internalization by host cells . Viruses enter host cells by several endocytic mechanisms upon binding of a receptor on the cell surface : clathrin - mediated endocytosis , caveolin - mediated endocytosis or clathrin / caveolin - independent endocytosis and macropinocytosis . Following endocytosis , viruses are directed to the early endosome . During endosome maturation , the pH of endocytic vesicles decreases . This results in viral membrane fusion , endosomal escape or membrane disruption , with the release of viral genome . Table 4 Examples of viruses and their endocytosis mechanism .

Makvandi , M . Chen , R . Sartorius et al . Nano Today 40 ( 2021 ) 101279 21 dominant - negative mutation of caveolin - 1 . This suggests the in - volvement of a caveolae - mediated pathway . The ZIKA infection pathway showed subsequent transport through Rab5 - positive and Rab7 - positive vesicles . This observation is indicative of the partici - pation of early and late endosomes in the life cycle of the ZIKA virus within the host cell [ 195 ] . C - type lectin receptors recognize ZIKA viruses through their E surface proteins . Flaviviruses such as ZIKA can also enter a host cell through receptors that do not bind to E protein . Negatively - charged lipids on the viral membrane interact with lipid receptors such as T - cell immunoglobulin mucin ( TIM ) and tyrosine kinase receptors TAM ( T YRO3 , A XL and M ER ) on the host cell surface to mediate endocytosis of the ZIKA virus [ 196 ] . The enveloped alphavirus , Mayaro virus , is the causative agent of a mosquito - borne febrile illness with highly debilitating ar - thralgia . Although its preferential route of endocytosis is medi - ated by clathrin , the virus also uses cholesterol - enriched caveolae - derived vesicles as an alternative route for cell entry . Mayaro viruses are highly dependent on cholesterol for cell in - fection . Caveolin - coated vesicles containing Mayaro viruses showed co - localization with the early endosome marker Rab5 ; the observation indicates that endocytosed viruses are rapidly deliv - ered into early endosomes where membrane fusion occurs be - tween the virus and the endosome [ 197 ] . Studies on the HIV - 1 have identified multiple ways in which caveolin - 1 is involved in HIV - 1 infection and life cycle . A role for the HIV retrovirus protein “negative regulatory factor” ( Nef ) is the alteration of cholesterol metabolism , as was demonstrated in macrophages . There is enhanced cholesterol transport to the cell membrane and increase in caveolin - 1 during HIV infection . The enhanced level of caveolin - 1 subsequently promotes cholesterol efflux , blocks the fusion steps of virus infectivity and enables the viral particles to persist inside the infected cells [ 228 ] . Human coronavirus OC43 ( hCoV - OC43 ) is a betacoronavirus re - sponsible for diseases of the respiratory tracts in humans . This en - veloped , positive - sense , single - stranded RNA virus uses sialoglycan - based receptors containing 9 - O - acetylated sialic acid as entry portal for internalization [ 198 ] . hCoV - OC43 have been reported to utilize caveolin - 1 - dependent endocytosis for host cell infection . Formation of caveolae vesicles containing the betacoronaviruses is mediated by dynamin . Incubation of cells with the nystatin inhibitor , or depletion of caveolin - 1 by RNA interference technology abrogated hCoV - OC43 cell infection . Those findings indicate that virus entry is caveolae - mediated [ 229 ] . Nasal epithelial cells , which represent the gateway of entry for many coronaviruses ( including the novel SARS - CoV - 2 betacoronavirus ) , express high levels of dynamin , the endocytic marker for CME and the caveolae - mediated endocytosis . Thus , it is not surprising that these pathways are involved in the entry of coronaviruses [ 12 ] . Macropinocytosis Macropinocytosis is a transient , actin - dependent cellular process used by viruses larger than 150 – 200 nm , such as the African swine fever virus and the vaccinia virus [ 199 ] . The entry of a virus by macropinocytosis starts with contact between the virus and the cell membrane of the host , which may occur via receptor binding or by simple contact and adsorption to proteoglycans or other extra - cellular matrix components . Attachment of the virus to the cell membrane triggers the intracellular signals necessary to initiate transduction of the proteins involved in the formation of macro - pinosomes . The signaling pathway involves activation of multiple kinases , GTPases and other factors that in turn affect cell mor - phology , induce actin depolymerization , membrane blebbing and ruffles , as well as actin - dependent formation of membrane Fig . 13 . Influenza A virus ( IAV ) endocytosis mechanism mediated by hemagglutinin proteins ( HA ) . ( a ) Viral hemagglutinin proteins ( HA1 , HA2 ) of the virus coat bind to sialic acid - containing receptors on the cell surface . ( b ) HAs can also bind to the sialylated Ca 2 + channels to induce intracellular Ca 2 + fluxes . The virus is then internalized and transported to the early endosome via a specific endocytosis mechanism . Endosome maturation induces HAl to change from its pre - fusion to a post - fusion conformation . This causes fusion of the IAV membrane with the endosomal membrane . Subsequent virus uncoating releases the viral genome into the cytosol [ 192 ] . P . Makvandi , M . Chen , R . Sartorius et al . Nano Today 40 ( 2021 ) 101279 22 Fig . 14 .

Schematic of the SV40 virus , showing the major structural protein VP1 assembled into pentamers . b . SV40 entry is mediated by its binding to the ganglioside GM1 on the host cell membrane . This binding triggers a signaling cascade that results in caveolae - mediated endocytosis and virus internalization into the endosome . c . The endosome carries the virus to the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) . The virus escapes from the ER into the cytosol where it is disassembled . The disassembled virus components release their viral genome to the nucleus . This enables transcription and replication of the SV40 virus ( reprinted from [ 193 ] with permission from MDPI under a Creative Commons Attribution - NonCommercial 4 . 0 International License ) .

These transient changes permit the uptake of extracellular liquid and internalization of large parts of plasma membrane with surface - bound viruses [ 231 ] . The virus - containing macropinosomes are then transferred through the cytosol for fusion with late endosomes or lysosomes . Viruses larger than the invaginations observed in CME or ca - veolae - mediated endocytosis employ preferentially this mechanism for cell entry , as observed for many filoviruses , poxviruses , para - myxovirus , adenovirus and HIV - 1 [ 203 , 232 ] . One well - studied ex - ample is the filovirus Ebola ( Fig . 15 ) . Ebola viruses are very variable in length , ranging from 600 to 1400 nm long . Hence , viral entry excludes the involvement of clathrin - or caveolin - coated vesicles . The internalization of Ebola virus is dependent on the presence of cholesterol - enriched lipid raft microdomains and lipid raft forma - tion . Ebola virus binds to the host cell surface using its viral spike glycoprotein . After internalization , the virus is trafficked through early and late endosomes to lysosomes where membrane fusion and genome release occur [ 201 ] . Unusual endocytic pathways In addition to the aforementioned well - characterized pathways , some viruses utilize other mechanisms for internalization into host cells . These entry mechanisms are generally independent of clathrin and caveolae , and maybe dynamin - dependent or dynamin - in - dependent . The evolution of such unusual endocytic pathways may have been dictated by the particular needs of various virus species to develop more productive infections , such as the need to bypass the endosomes and be transported to the low pH lysosomes to promote the fusogenic activity of the viral glycoproteins for virus uncoating . Non - canonical endocytosis pathways are used by several viruses . For example , human papilloma virus - 16 ( HPV - 16 ) entry into epithelial cells involves a mechanism that is clathrin - , caveolin - , lipid raft ‐ , flotillin - , cholesterol - and dynamin ‐ independent , but shows simila - rities to macropinocytosis . Similar to classical macropinocytosis , HPV - 16 endocytosis involves actin cytoskeleton reorganization and tyrosine kinase signaling . Nevertheless , this form of endocytosis is independent of classical Rho ‐ like GTPase signaling [ 234 ] . Binding of HPV - 16 to host cells occurs through interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the plasma membrane of epithelial cells . The viral particles are then transferred to a secondary uptake receptor com - plex including the tetraspanin CD151 and annexin A2 / S100A10 heterotetramer as organizers of the HPV - 16 entry platform and as a secondary receptor to mediate endocytosis and intracellular traf - ficking of HPV - 16 through endosomes [ 205 , 235 ] . Some of the fea - tures of this unusual pathway have also been reported as one of the alternate pathways described for the entry of influenza A virus [ 236 ] . Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and Lassa fever arenavirus , the causative agents of acute hemorrhagic fever endemic in many West African countries , have been reported to enter host cells via an unknown clathrin - , caveolin - and dynamin - independent pathway . Upon alpha - dystroglycan binding , arenaviruses are able to enter host cells via multivesicular bodies and are rapidly delivered to the late endosomes where fusion occurs , bypassing the early endosomes . Unlike other viruses , the entry of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus does not seem to induce evident changes in cell morphology or changes in actin , suggesting an unusual , yet - to - be - discovered en - docytic mechanism for the entry of arenaviruses in their host cells [ 207 ] . Glycosylphosphatidylinositol - anchored protein - enriched en - dosomal compartments ( GEEC ) are less commonly used by viruses to enter host cells . Endocytosis through GEEC involves lipid rafts but not clathrin , caveolin or dynamin . The uptake of adeno - associated viruses was prevented by inhibiting Arf1 , Cdc42 and GRAF1 , factors that mediate the formation of clathrin - independent carriers ( CLIC ) involved in the GEEC pathway [ 208 ] . Nevertheless , other studies suggest that macropinocytosis is used by adeno - associated viruses as a mechanism for virus uptake in certain cell types [ 209 ] . Although the most commonly described entry route is clathrin - mediated , the Dengue virus has been reported to penetrate host cells via a non - canonical endocytic pathway mediated by dynamin but independent of clathrin , caveolae or lipid rafts [ 237 ] . Fig . 15 . Ebola virus entry by macropinocytosis . The Ebola virus binds to different molecules on the host cell membrane by means of its surface spike glycoproteins , including the C - type lectin receptors DC - SIGN and L - SIGN . TIM - 1 and AXL1 receptors act as coreceptors . Following host cell membrane attachment , the Ebola virus is internalized by mac - ropinocytosis . During endosome maturation to late endosome / lysosome , the glycoprotein GP1 is proteolytically cleaved by cathepsins L and B to its fusogenic form . Cleaved GP1 interacts with the endosomal receptor NPC1 . These events result in the fusion of the membranes of the endosome and the lysosome , which releases the viral genome into the cytosol [ 233 ] . P . Makvandi , M . Chen , R . Sartorius et al . Nano Today 40 ( 2021 ) 101279 24 Different pathways of endocytosis : identification and analysis Endocytosis pathways have unique diagnostic criteria . The size of the endocytic vesicle , for example , is highly variable . Sizes including ~ 100 nm spherical , ~ 60 – 80 nm tubular ( maybe several hundred nm long ) , ~ 100 nm tubular and > 200 nm tubular have been reported in the literature for CME in different cell types [ 28 ] . This variability enables large nanoparticles and rod - like viruses to enter the internal milieu of a cell via actin elongation of a clathrin - coated pit [ 238 ] . The fast endophilin - mediated endocytosis ( FEME ) pathway is dynamin - dependent and independent of clathrin . The FEME pathway produces endocytic carriers after ligand binding to specific receptors [ 239 ] . It relies on interactions between the SRC homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain of dependent receptors and endophilin ( e . g . G - protein - associated receptors ) or indirect communication through intermediate proteins ( CIN85 and CBl ) [ 239 ] . These interactions stabilize endophilin that is localized to the leading edge of migrating cells through the phosphatidylinositol ( 3 , 4 ) - bisphosphate - binding protein lamellipodin . The FEME pathway can form carriers in a fraction of a second the created tubular carriers are 60 – 80 nm dia - meter and several hundred nm long [ 239 ] . The CLIC / GEEC pathway is entirely independent of dynamin or clathrin . However , it is similar to the FEME pathway in that both are located at the anterior edge of migratory cells and include tubular and ring - shaped pleomorphic carriers . Unlike FEME that is stimulated by receptor - ligand interac - tion , the CLIC / GEEC pathway occurs continuously . This unique fea - ture of the CLIC / PEEC pathway results in the uptake of abundant surface proteins such as the hyaluronic acid receptor ( CD44 ) and the glycosylphosphatidylinositol - anchored protein [ 239 – 241 ] . Phagocytosis involves the uptake of smaller particles , including nanoparticles [ 242 ] . Membrane extension and phagosome formation depend on the actin cytoskeleton , which eventually becomes poly - meric at the base of the cup and polymerizes along with the particle at the tip of the lamellae . Phagocytosis involves a series of small GTPases , including cell division control protein 32 homolog ( Cdc42 ) , Rac , and RhoA , that work with effectors such as Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) and Arp2 / 3 complex to produce a bran - ched actin network [ 243 ] . Caveolae morphology is a valuable benchmark for their identifi - cation . A caveola comprises an onion - shaped pit ( ~ 60 nm in dia - meter ) with a narrow neck attached to the plasma membrane . Caveolae are generated by caveolins and cavins that work in con - verting with accessory proteins such as Eps15 homology domain - containing 2 ( EHD2 ) , pacsin / syndapins and tyrosine - protein kinase transmembrane receptor ( ROR1 ) . Loss of caveolae occurs when the expression of caveolin - 1 , caveolin - 3 or cavin1 is ablated [ 225 ] . Understanding the uptake mechanism of viruses is important for the development of effective and functional biotherapeutics . Knowledge of virus entry mechanisms into cells has inspired sci - entists to synthesize efficient and productive nanomaterials . Viruses are naturally - occurring nanoparticles that are capable of defying host protection mechanisms and entering the cells to exert their functions . Inspired by viruses , researchers have developed increas - ingly efficient nanomaterials in terms of size , shape and surface functionalization , to improve targeting to the host cell , maximize cargo entry and achieve more precise delivery to the destined sub - cellular compartments . For example , some encapsulated viruses enter host cells through direct fusion with the plasma membrane , a pathway that is exploited by different engineered nanoparticle sys - tems [ 244 ] . Likewise , nanorods are inspired by rod - like viruses , the entry of which is mediated by CME through actin elongation of the clathrin - coated vesicles [ 245 ] . It has been shown that both viruses and nanoparticles of specific sizes can induce the formation of an appropriate curvature of the cell membrane . This process is neces - sary for recruiting the proteins involved in the CME pathways . In the case of viruses , the concomitant presence of signals mediated by their interaction with cell surface receptors trigger endocytosis and their internalization [ 246 ] . Highly - efficient viral infection that occurs through receptor - mediated endocytosis provides the blueprint for the biomimetic design of therapeutic nanoparticles that are en - gineered for specific entry through binding to specific cell surface receptors ( e . g . via the hemagglutinin receptor or the C - type lectin receptor ) . The mechanisms of viral infection of host cells have also inspired scientists to develop positively - charged nanoparticles that can expedite endocytosis via absorption to the cell membrane [ 245 ] . The study of virus endocytosis mechanisms can also aid in devel - oping advanced engineered nanomaterials that can escape the sur - veillance of host immune cells , thereby avoiding rapid clearance by the mononuclear phagocytic cells and prolonging circulation time of these novel nanomaterials in the bloodstream [ 247 ] . Although dif - ferences exist between the uptake and internalization pathways employed by viruses and nanomaterials , naturally - occurring viruses still represent an inexhaustible source of inspiration for researchers in the field of biomedicine . Nanobiovectors ( e . g . viruses ) are usually recognized by cellular receptors on the plasma membrane [ 248 ] . Abiotic engineered na - nomaterials ( e . g . metal nanoparticles ) are internalized by cells using multiple cellular mechanisms . Abiotic nanocompounds possess dif - ferent sizes , compositions , architectures , surface charges , hydro - phobicity , roughness and elasticity . Hence , there are different ways for nanoparticles to be recognized by cells through a selective en - docytosis mechanism [ 1 ] . For example , the efficacy of entry of na - noparticles with various dimensions into cells is of the order : 50 nm > 200 nm > 500 nm > 1000 nm [ 249 ] . The geometric shape also affects the number of nanoparticles that can attach to the cell surface receptors , This is an essential characteristic for counteracting blood flow [ 250 ] . Nanorods can bind to many cell surface receptors because of their long axis structure , compared to spherical nano - particles [ 251 ] . Nanoparticle shape can result in breaking of the curvature energy landscape , which , in turn , determines the en - docytic pathway for their intake [ 134 ] . Cell uptake study of three gold nanoparticles with the same size ( ~ 50 nm ) but different ar - chitectures ( stars , rods and triangles ) showed that the gold nano - triangles are preferentially uptaken by RAW264 . 7 macrophage cells [ 251 ] . In contrast , gold nanorods and gold nanostars were pre - ferentially uptaken by CME . The surface charge of nanoparticles also affect their endocytosis efficacy . Although abiotic engineered nanomaterials may enter cells by direct fusion with the plasma membrane , they are more often up - taken via endocytosis . Physical properties such as the size , surface engineering ( e . g . expression of ligand for a certain cell receptor ) or the target cell type can be instructional on the endocytosis pathway employed by the nanoparticles . For instance , large nanostructures with a size range from 500 nm to a few micrometers can enter cells via macropinocytosis , whereas smaller nanoparticles often rely on CME [ 26 ] . Irrespective of the cell type , surface functionalization of the nanomaterials ( both before and after entering the human body ) can affect the route of endocytosis . For instance , coating of nano - particles with a bioactive agent can change their surface charge and size , which may alter the endocytic route . In addition , serum pro - teins play an essential role during nanoparticle endocytosis in vivo because these proteins are rapidly adsorbed on the nanoparticle surface to produce a protein corona . These proteins , like vi - tronectin , can bind to specific receptors on the cell surface and cause particles to accumulate before they reach the cell . This makes the nanoparticles much larger than when they are outside the body ( in water or phosphate - buffered saline ) [ 252 , 253 ] . This is an ex - ample illustrating that it may not be possible in many cases to predict the cell uptake pathway . Fig . 16 represents an overview of the different pathways through which viruses and nanomaterials can enter cells , depending on their shape , aspect ratio and surface functionality . P . Makvandi , M . Chen , R . Sartorius et al . Nano Today 40 ( 2021 ) 101279 25 Scientists have devoted a lot of effort on defining endocytosis pathways . Many of those studies utilize chemical inhibitors such as drugs that interfere with actin polymerization during macro - pinocytosis or phagocytosis ( e . g . cytochalasin D [ 254 ] or amiloride , which inhibit Na + / H + exchange at the cell surface , blocking micro - pinocytosis ) . Others employ inhibitors of CME such as the endosome acidification blocker , chloroquine [ 255 ] . Library screening of che - mical compounds to identify selective inhibitors of endocytic pro - cesses has led to the identification of dynasore , a pharmacological inhibitor of the guanosine triphosphatase ( GTPase ) activity of dy - namin , a GTPase protein that is essential for membrane fission during CME [ 256 ] . Pitstop 2 , another potent inhibitor of CME as well as clathrin - independent endocytosis , was discovered using a similar screening method [ 257 ] . Uptake studies often utilize a fluorescently - labeled cargo that can be analyzed using confocal fluorescence microscopy or flow cyto - metry . However , these techniques sometimes generate false in - formation because of the inability to discriminate between internalized material and merely membrane - bound material [ 258 ] . Thus , a number of precautions must be used to discriminate the different internalization pathways . Examples include the use of fluorescent click sensors [ 259 ] , pH - based sensors or quencher con - jugates [ 258 ] . In addition , genetic approaches such as gene silencing or knockout of proteins involved in the different internalization pathways ( e . g . Caveolin - 1 , Cavin1 , Dynamin - 2 or Clathrin ) are often employed to discriminate the different routes of cargo internaliza - tion [ 260 ] . Endocytic routes are novel pathways that are still in their infancy of study and need to be investigated further . However , many of the current study approaches have limitations and challenges . It is dif - ficult to identify cell uptake pathways due to the lack of standardized procedures . Moreover , the complexity of the endocytosis process , which involves many biomolecules , feedback loops and signaling cascades [ 49 ] , is still not fully understood . Inhibition of endocytic trafficking of nanomaterials and viruses Researchers routinely employ specific and non - specific pharma - cological / chemical inhibitors of endocytosis pathways to study the entry of cargoes ( i . e . proteins , viruses or nanomaterials ) into the cell as well as to discern the major endocytic pathway based on its dif - ferential sensitivity to the chemical blockers . Many compounds have been identified as selective blockers of the molecular components required for a specific form of endocytosis [ 255 ] . The possibility of rapid and acute administration , as well as the reversibility of the blocking are attractive characteristics . Nevertheless , endocytosis blockers should be employed with caution . First of all , the efficacy of the administered dose to the cells should be carefully determined for each cell type . This is because the cytotoxicity of endocytosis in - hibitors is strongly cell type - dependent [ 255 ] . Another salient issue that has to be considered is that the non - specific effects of such inhibitors on other endocytic pathways cannot be excluded . For example , chlorpromazine and potassium depletion inhibits CME by sequestering clathrin and adapter proteins from the plasma mem - brane to the intracellular organelles . However , these two drugs were found to have other unexpected roles in some types of cells in in - hibiting clathrin - independent endocytosis [ 261 ] . Similarly , several inhibitors employed to selectively block macropinocytosis also in - hibit the clathrin - independent / dynamin - dependent cell entry pathway [ 239 ] . The dynamin blocker Dynasore ( a GTPase inhibitor ) has been shown to interfere with the actin cytoskeleton and cho - lesterol homeostasis , thereby disrupting the lipid raft organization [ 256 ] . All these off - target side effects should be meticulously con - sidered in determining the role of a particular form of endocytosis in Fig . 16 . Schematic portraying the different pathways employed by viruses and nanomaterials for cell entry , based on their shape , aspect ratio and surface functionality . P . Makvandi , M . Chen , R . Sartorius et al . Nano Today 40 ( 2021 ) 101279 26 the cells . The combined use of genetic approaches , RNA interference and selective new generation pharmacologic agents should be sy - nergistically employed to inhibit endocytic trafficking of nanoma - terials [ 260 ] . Understanding the cellular mechanisms that mediate the entry of viruses into their host cells can be of great help in identifying pharmacological targets useful for blocking viral infections . Identification of new drugs capable of specifically inhibiting the entry of a virus is a very expensive and time - consuming process . For this reason , re - purposing of existing drugs is a strategy that can accelerate the development of pharmacological therapies [ 262 ] . The new coronavirus SARS - CoV - 2 is a respiratory virus belonging to the large family of coronaviruses and is the causative agent of the recent COVID - 19 pandemic . To date , the entry mechanisms and the implication of the endocytic pathway of the new emerging SARS - CoV - 2 have not been totally substantiated . Similar to SARS - CoV , the virus responsible for the original Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) , SARS - CoV - 2 predominantly binds its surface Spike proteins to the epithelial Angiotensin - Converting Enzyme II ( ACE2 ) receptor for cellular entry . This is followed by the endocytosis of the viral particles ( Fig . 17 ) . This route of entry includes cleavage of the spike protein by the transmembrane protease serine 2 ( TMPRSS2 ) into two functional subunits S1 and S2 . The S1 subunit is responsible for the binding of ACE2 via its receptor - binding domain , while the S2 sub - unit is involved in the fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane [ 210 ] . Recently neuropilin - 1 was proposed as a cell surface co - receptor for SARS - CoV - 2 infection , interacting with the spike S1 subunit . Inhibition of neuropilin - 1 by RNA interference , or using a mono - clonal antibody against neuropilin - 1 , impairs the interaction of the plasma membrane with SARS - Cov - 2 S1 , reducing viral entry in the host cells [ 263 , 264 ] . Well - known drugs that are capable of blocking the endocytosis process are currently being evaluated for blockade of SARS - CoV - 2 entry into lung epithelial cells . Some of these drugs have not yet been approved for human use [ 265 ] , but are on the list of essential medicine published by the World Health Organization , making them easily accessible anywhere in the world [ 12 ] . Chloroquine ( CQ ) and hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) are ancient , clinically available anti - ma - laria drugs . Their re - purposing was proposed for the treatment and prophylaxis of ZIKA virus infections [ 266 ] . During the new COVID - 19 pandemic , the scientific community is actively exploring the use of CQ and HCQ to combat SARS - CoV - 2 infections . Both drugs are ly - sosomotropic drugs that block viral fusion events by increasing the pH in vacuoles , which adversely affect endolysosomal trafficking . In addition , both CQ and HCQ interfere with the glycosylation of ACE2 , impairing binding of the viral spike proteins to host cell surface receptors [ 267 , 268 ] . Several in vitro [ 269 , 270 ] and preclinical [ 271 , 272 ] studies on the use of CQ and HCQ in blocking SARS - CoC - 2 infection have been conducted . Although in vitro studies have clearly demonstrated the antiviral activity of these compounds , subsequent clinical studies failed to confirm the benefits of the use of these drugs in COVID - 19 treatment [ 267 , 273 ] . Many viruses , including filoviruses and coronaviruses , require proteolytic processing of their surface glycoproteins to penetrate host cells [ 274 ] . Endosomal - lysosomal protease inhibitors such as the serine protease inhibitor Camostat have been recently proposed for the treatment of SARS - CoV and middle east respiratory syn - drome - related coronavirus ( MERS - COV ) infections [ 275 ] . Serine proteases are involved in the cleavage of the spike protein into S1 and S2 subunits . Recently , Camostat has been reported to be hopeful in blocking the entry of SARS - CoV - 2 by inhibiting the TMPRSS2 protein . The latter is indispensable for proteolytic processing of the SARS - CoV - 2 spike protein . These pieces of evidence suggest a pos - sible new target for anti - COVID - 19 therapeutic interventions [ 276 ] . Cyclophilin A ( CyPA ) is an intracellular protein belonging to the PPlase family . It is involved in the replication of RNA viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) , Fig . 17 . The two proposed routes of entry for SARS - CoV - 2 to date . Angiotensin - converting - enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) , which has been described as an interferon - stimulated gene ( ISG ) , is the predominant route of entry for SARS - CoV - 2 . In addition , CD147 is purported as a potential second route of entry . Based on a previous study with SARS - CoV , interaction with cyclophilin A is also possible . The blue background corresponds to cells expressing ACE2 , whereas the red background represents cells expressing CD147 . Solid arrows correspond to a direct activity involving ACE2 . Dotted arrows correspond to an indirect promoting activity . Reprinted from [ 210 ] with permission from MDPI under a Creative Commons Attribution - NonCommercial 4 . 0 International License . P . Makvandi , M . Chen , R . Sartorius et al . Nano Today 40 ( 2021 ) 101279 27 hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) and coronaviruses such as SARS - CoV and SARS - CoV - 2 . Host cyclophilin A is a potential drug target for cor - onaviruses and cyclosporine A ( CsA ) can act as CyPA inhibitor . Cyclosporine A binding to CyPA changes it conformation , blocks viral replication and prevents its from binding with host cell surface re - ceptor ( see below ) [ 277 ] . Cyclophilin A is involved not only in virus replication but also in virus infection . After interaction with the viral proteins , CyPA is in - corporated on the surface of virus particles released from the host cells . The involvement of the highly glycosylated transmembrane protein CD147 as a third receptor for the SARS - CoV - 2 virus entry has recently been reported [ 278 ] . SARS - CoV - 2 can interact with CD147 via binding with CyPA , increasing virus adhesion to host cells . This important finding suggests that CyPA inhibitors such as CsA may be used for blocking this route of SARS - CoV - 2 entry [ 210 ] . Because of its immunosuppressive effects , the use of CsA can cause adverse side effects . For this reason , non - immunosuppressive analogs based on chemical modifications of CsA are currently being evaluated in many clinical trials . These CsA derivatives can preserve the inhibitory ef - fect of the drug but without inducing immunosuppression in hu - mans [ 277 ] . Drugs blocking CME have been shown to be hopeful in blocking entry of SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV viruses . Although it has not been conclusively proven , evidence suggests that SARS - CoV - 2 may also utilize a clathrin - mediated mechanism for endocytosis into host cells [ 211 ] . Targeting CME using blocking agents such as chlorpro - mazine , a drug yet to be approved by the US Food and Drug Ad - ministration but used extensively in the treatment of psychoses , may be a promising strategy for fighting SARS - CoV - 2 infec - tions [ 279 ] . Nanotherapy may also be exploited to disable virus particles such as SARS - CoV - 2 , by deactivating their surface proteins . For example , polymeric nanoparticles may be surface functionalized by dec - orating them with biomimetic ACE2 proteins . In this scenario , they can as decoys by attacking the SARS - CoV - 2 viruses and attaching to the viruses via those biomimetic ACE2 proteins to deactivate the viruses . Concluding remarks , challenges and future perspectives Despite their remarkable achievements , there are pivotal hurdles to be overcome prior to the routine use of nanomaterials for bio - medical applications . One of these challenges is a clear compre - hension of the endocytosis mechanisms involved in the cellular uptake of nanomaterials with different characteristics . Different parameters affect the endocytosis of nanoparticles . The major factors include size , architecture and surface functionality of the nanoma - terials . Other variables such as topography [ 280 ] , morphology [ 281 ] , colloidal stability , density and powder kinetics also have to be con - sidered [ 103 ] . Even if the aforementioned factors have been ad - dressed for a specific type of nanomaterial , there are additional characteristics that should be contemplated . For example , the con - centration of decorated substances on the nanomaterials ( i . e . ligand density ) , as well as polydispersity of nanoparticles ( i . e . size dis - tribution ratio ) are other important features . This is because cells are not exposed to one particle or monodisperse particles . Nanoparticles possess a size range and may have different degrees of functionali - zation . It is important to reiterate that the effect of one variable of na - noparticle characteristics cannot be generalized for other nano - particles . As an example , the influence of surface charge is different for nanosheets and nanorods . Enhancing the surface charge in one nanostructure may enhance cellular uptake while internalization may be reduced with another nanostructure . The quantity of cellular uptake of positively - charged graphene nanosheets is independent of their size , whereas the internalization efficacy of negatively - charged graphene nanosheets is dependent on their size [ 125 ] . The same trend , however , does not apply to gold nanorods . A vaguely explored parameter that should also be comprehended in detail is the adverse effects of nanomaterials , especially metallic nanoparticles , after they are internalized into host cells via en - docytosis . Metallic nanoparticles that are uptaken contain a sig - nificant amount of that metal element . Processing of these nanoparticles within acidic lysosomes may result in intracellular accumulation and even overloading of the particular metal ion . Because such an ion internalization process does not involve the cell’s metal ion transporters , it may provoke excessive oxidative stresses that damage the cells’ DNA , lipids and proteins . Thus , parameters such as dose - dependent impact of metal nanoparticle uptake , oxidative stress response , DNA damage response and the expression of apoptosis - associated genes should be stringently as - sessed when nanoparticle endocytosis is studied [ 282 ] . Another significant parameter is the type of cell lines used to evaluate the cellular uptake of nanoparticles ex vivo . For in - stance , normal and tumor cell lines possess different character - istics that induce different behavior for a specific nanoparticle . In addition , these cell lines possess different microenvironments compared to the tissues that surround cells in vivo . This micro - environment ( e . g . normal tissue with pH 7 . 2 – 7 . 4 and tumor tissue with pH 6 . 0 – 6 . 8 ) also may affect the intrinsic properties of nanoparticles such as surface charge . In addition to the micro - environment , another parameter that should be taken into ac - count when performing in vivo investigations is protein adsorption on the surface of the nanoparticles within the circu - lation . The adsorbed serum proteins in this protein corona may adversely influence how nanoparticles enter cells , such as the time required for internalization [ 4 , 283 ] . The last , but certainly not least challenge , is the inconsistency between in vitro and in vivo experimental results . Bluntly expressed , the positive results obtained from in vitro studies may not be de - monstrable in vivo studies . Thus , it is crucial to construct an in vitro system that mimics the in vivo microenvironments well , or at least develop some theoretical models that enable the translation of in vitro results into in vivo application strategies [ 284 ] . Viruses can be valuable tools in the development of nano - technologies . They are nature - derived nanoscaffolds with unique properties and that can be modified relatively easily in terms of structure and surface charge . Virus - like particles are examples of self - assembled nanocarriers incorporating viral structural proteins which mimic the physicochemical properties of live infectious viruses . These virus - like particles enter host cells using the same endocytosis mechanisms employed by natural pathogens . Thus , they are used in nanotechnology as drug and gene delivery systems , imaging agents and as vaccines against infectious diseases [ 285 ] . Understanding the mechanisms of endocytosis may provide avid opportunities to control the fate of virus - like particles and other nanomaterials in human cells , and to improve the efficacy of nano - particle uptake . Knowledge on the cell surface receptors utilized by viruses in receptor - mediated endocytosis pathways may be exploited for targeting nanocarriers in specific cell subpopulations . Likewise , such information may be employed for designing nano - particles with augmented rates of endocytosis for optimized delivery of therapeutic drugs to specific target cells . Studies on the escape mechanisms developed by viruses to avoid the degradative en - vironment of the endolysosomal compartments will be extremely useful in enhancing the pharmacokinetics and the stability of ther - apeutic nanoparticles [ 213 ] . In addition , laboratory - synthesized molecules that mimic the ligands of specific cellular receptors may be used to localize nanoparticles in endosomal / phagosomal com - partments , to activate antigen - presenting immune cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages to trigger adaptive immune re - sponses [ 286 ] . P . Makvandi , M . Chen , R . Sartorius et al . Nano Today 40 ( 2021 ) 101279 28 A profound understanding of endocytosis mechanisms and in - tracellular ingress pathways used by viruses should help in devel - oping drugs that block the entry of viruses or determine their fate during their trafficking within the host cell . As in the case of the recent SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic , strategies for blocking host cell in - fection may focus on various stages of the viral cycle . Drugs that are capable of blocking the interaction of the virus with its host cell receptor , such as the ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers ( e . g . captopril , ramipril and losartan ) and guanidino - based serine protease inhibitors ( e . g . camostat and nafamostat ) have been used for emergency treatment of severely - infected Covid - 19 human subjects [ 287 ] . Drugs that interfere with CME and / or caveolae - mediated endocytosis , drugs that prevent endosome maturation , as well as drugs that block cleavage and activation of viral proteins involved in the fusion of the viral capsid with the host cell mem - brane , are valuable tools in development of broad - spectrum phar - maceutics for combating the emergence and re - emergence of virus - based epidemics and pandemics [ 288 , 289 ] .
