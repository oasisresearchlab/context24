However , acquiring the necessary skills and knowledge demands spending time and effort on repetitive practice . While teachers can assess skills and provide guidance , such immediate feedback is not accessible during the exercise between lessons . Based on a similar motivation , work in other education domains , such as sports training [ 22 , 33 , 37 ] , has started to increasingly leverage data - driven approaches to expand this feedback loop with an additional data angle . Visual analysis can then be used to guide decisions and increase motivation [ 15 ] . However , to the best of our knowledge , approaches that systematically record and visually analyze data for music education are still largely missing . We envision a similar data - driven learning process for music education that incorporates recorded play data from students and teachers . We believe that such approaches can further enrich — but not fully replace — traditional instrument teaching and learning processes . Since music is diverse and often subject to taste and a r X i v : 2203 . 13320v1 [ c s . H C ] 24 M a r 2022 CHI ’22 , April 29 – May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA Heyen , et al . culture , automatic assessment cannot fully replace human judge - ment [ 7 ] . This calls for a human - in - the - loop solution as commonly provided by visual analysis interfaces [ 34 , 35 ] . Using data visualiza - tion , teachers and students can then analyze performance , skills , and progress while bringing in their experience and subjective judgement . Let us take improvisation as an example : In this cre - ative task , there is no clear and universal judgment for good or bad and automatic analysis might thus not be sufficient . Instead , a heatmap visualization that shows how often notes on a guitar fretboard were played by each student would allow teachers to compare different improvisation styles and evaluate them based on their own expertise — just as one example . To start exploring this new design space , we conducted a design exploration study on data - and visualization - driven instrument learning by recording and analyzing data from nine guitar players over a span of three months . This process resulted in different visualization designs , of which we present and discuss four in this paper ( Figure 1 ) . 2 RELATED WORK Visualization with focus on music - related data covers a wide range of applications [ 19 ] , including the analysis of raw audio [ 9 ] , ab - stract meta data [ 5 ] , repeating patterns [ 40 ] , personal listening histories [ 5 ] , and music theoretical aspects of pieces [ 11 , 27 , 28 ] . As visual analysis of instrument - generated data for education pur - poses has not yet been addressed by research , we especially focus on amateur exercise recordings and visual comparison [ 12 ] between different people’s personal [ 15 ] recordings . Instrument education games such as Rocksmith 1 , Yousician 2 , and Synthesia 3 only provide immediate or coarsely aggregated feedback , mostly limited to simple scores or bar and line charts . Moreover , automatic assessment does not yet meet the requirements of profes - sional music education [ 7 ] . We therefore propose a user - centered approach where a teacher or student makes the assessment , sup - ported by visualization on multiple levels of detail and abstraction . Other work investigated human - computer interaction for mu - sical instruments : Strummer [ 3 ] , for instance , teaches playing gui - tar chords using audio input for assessment . Colored sheet mu - sic [ 4 , 14 , 38 ] can visualize assessments by highlighting mistakes and comparing student’s and teacher’s recordings . Feedback can be provided on screens , but also through augmented reality dis - plays for drum kits [ 42 ] and guitars [ 23 ] . Instruments themselves can be fitted with touch sensors and LEDs to track exercises and show feedback [ 25 ] . Sensor measurements were also used by some approaches to adapt the exercises’ tempo or difficulty [ 18 , 43 ] or let users control effects [ 17 ] . Soloist [ 39 ] makes use of existing material by creating overviews of instructional videos for guitar and extract - ing the played notes from audio through CREPE [ 20 ] , so users can visually compare their playing to the instructor’s in a simple chart . The above approaches focus on live control or feedback for single recordings . Instead , we want to show much larger data collections at once . 1 https : / / rocksmith . ubisoft . com / 2 https : / / yousician . com / 3 https : / / synthesiagame . com / 3 PROCESS & DATA The primary goal of our work is to start exploring the design space of data - driven music training . To that end , we opted for a data - driven , participatory design process [ 13 , 16 , 35 ] , in which we created and explored different visualization designs together with nine guitar players over a period of three months . As participants were located in different cities , we arranged weekly online meetings that we loosely structured as a guitar course with one teacher and eight students with different skill levels . This teacher previously taught guitar at a music school for seven years . The exercises given to the students consisted of ( 1 ) scale patterns , ( 2 ) riffs from actual songs , and ( 3 ) improvisations playing along an A - minor blues backing track . Throughout the course , we analyzed recorded data together through descriptive and aggregated visual - izations ( see below ) . We used formative feedback from participants for iterative design adjustments . In terms of data , we opted for MIDI [ 30 ] over direct audio , as discrete note events are easier to interpret both by computers and humans . We used guitars fitted with Fishman MIDI pickups 4 and a Jamstick MIDI guitar 5 . All participants were equipped with this hardware and asked to record their practice data whenever possible . 4 VISUALIZATION DESIGNS Since our design is not targeted at visualization experts , we de - signed rather simple visualizations and focused on aggregations and domain - specific representations , of which we describe four examples in the following subsections . Figure 1 shows screenshots of these examples . 4 . 1 Comparison to Sheet Music & Progress Tracking For most music pieces and instrument exercises , there is sheet mu - sic available that a student tries to follow closely while learning . A comparison to this “ground truth” data therefore allows to estimate skills and progress . As explained above , automatic approaches are not reliable in this task . We therefore use visualization and aggre - gation to let a student or teacher take a look and judge based on context and experience . Our visualizations show different levels of detail , starting with an overview [ 36 ] that shows the students’ errors over all notes ( top to bottom ) and all repetitions ( left to right ) of an exercise ( Figure 1a ) . Each cell of the heatmap represents a note and is colored by the difference in timing between recording and sheet music : from dark blue for too early , over white , to dark red for too late . In the shown example , colors get lighter with more repetitions as the student improves , while there remain issues with some notes , indicated by horizontal stripes . Alternative representations show these colors inside sheet music , either for a single recording or as a mean of multiple . 4 https : / / www . fishman . com / tripleplay / 5 https : / / www . zivix . co / jamstik Data - Driven Visual Reflection on Music Instrument Practice CHI ’22 , April 29 – May 5 , 2022 , New Orleans , LA , USA 4 . 2 Instrument Heatmaps The following three examples use recordings of improvisation over a common backing track . Here , players are not interested in follow - ing a music piece , but instead want to express themselves and find personal styles . Comparison to other players , for example a teacher or a famous artist , can help learn new playstyles . A simple way to summarize an improvisation is to use instrument heatmaps . They show a simplified image of the physical instrument and encode information therein , for example by coloring instrument parts . As we are using guitars , we designed different heatmaps showing the guitar’s fretboard with strings as rows and frets as columns ( Figure 1b ) . Each cell represents a note , positioned on a given string and fret , which can be colored by how often it was played in one or multiple recordings . Looking at such heatmaps of different players allows comparing their general style . In Figure 1b , for example , we can see that player A ( red ) uses the lower strings , but player B ( blue ) does not , while they share some common notes ( gray ) . 4 . 3 Improvisation Similarity Having many such instrument heatmaps makes comparison diffi - cult , as there are only a few that can be shown at once without too much mental load . We therefore explored a similarity - based layout , where more similar heatmaps are placed closer to each other using multidimensional scaling ( MDS ) [ 6 , 21 ] . The result is presented as a scatterplot , where each “point” represents a recording shown as fretboard heatmap ( see above ) . Two recordings being close means that they used similar notes in the improvisation ( without going into detail here on how we computer the distance ) . As Figure 1c shows , we can use such a visualization to detect outliers , which might be interesting as they represent very different playstyles that could serve as inspiration . The fretboard heatmap representations in this example serve as multi - dimensional glyphs [ 10 ] . As such , we decided to colorize the notes of each fret differently to allow for pre - attentive pattern detec - tion . Saturation encodes how often a note was played ( normalized over all notes ) . In our example , for instance , most improvisations used the A minor pentatonic scale ( a set of notes that fits the back - ing track well ) on the fifth fret , which shows up as red - to - orange cells in the left half of Figure 1c . 4 . 4 Music Theory for Improvisation In music theory , scales such as the A minor pentatonic serve as guidelines for which notes to pick and how often or long to play them . For our blues improvisation example , there is a so - called blue note that can be added sparingly to sound more interesting . Based on the theory input from the guitar teacher , we thus de - signed an ordinal / categorical color scheme for the different roles of notes . Our visualization then represents each played note by a rounded rectangle with the corresponding color ; each line repre - sents a different recording ( Figure 1d ) . This encoding allows seeing , for instance , that the bottom most recording has a rather long blue note , which could be a mistake — or inspiration — to further investigate by listening to the audio . 4 . 5 Discussion The four examples presented above are meant as illustration of the broader approach of using data visualization to further enrich instrument learning . In fact , we also created various other visual - izations during our process , which we have not discussed here for space reasons . More importantly though , we believe the concept behind is much broader and can be used for many other settings , instruments , and learning / teaching approaches . Here , we focused on a online teacher - student group setup and guitar as the instrument of choice . We collected plenty of feed - back from our participants throughout the process . Reporting these results in depth is beyond the scope of this paper . However , two of the main benefits of our approach that participants frequently mentioned were : ( 1 ) The teacher can assess all students together , whereby subgroups of students can be defined based on skill or taste , for example , to let experienced students help less experienced ones that like to learn a common piece . ( 2 ) Students can compare their playing and progress to others’ for competitive motivation and to ask others about common issues . In terms of visualization , we note that there are many abstractly similar types of visualizations that can be taken as inspiration . In our case , we use MIDI , which essentially boils down to the abstract group of temporal sequence data visualizations . There exists a range of work on visual analysis of such temporal data [ 1 ] . Examples in - clude PlanningLines [ 2 ] , LifeFlow [ 41 ] , and EventRiver [ 24 ] . We used these approaches as inspiration in our design process and extended them to the domain - specific requirements of music recordings . Gen - erally , we echo the value of problem and data abstraction in such design processes [ 26 , 32 , 35 ] . 5 CONCLUSION We explored various ways to leverage visualizations of recorded practice data for music education . Instead of automatic assessment , we recommend to visually support the analysis and comparison by humans . A teacher can , for instance , focus time on reasoning and explanation instead of asking students how much they practiced last week . Through a participatory design process , we designed and evaluated several means for visual comparison to others . Feedback we gathered from our participants demonstrates that our approach helps confirm assumptions and reveal new insights . We also found challenging design considerations , including trade - offs between user freedom and data comparability , too detailed and too abstract information , and focus on abstraction versus visual encodings . In the future , we plan to extend our approach to other instru - ments , genres , and playstyles , by adapting and extending our cur - rent designs . Furthermore , we will investigate aggregation tech - niques for larger datasets . For evaluation , we plan to conduct a longitudinal field study in cooperation with a music school . We believe that data - driven music education has potential to support teachers and students and provide new ways to practice and analyze music exercises in personal and remote learning scenarios .
