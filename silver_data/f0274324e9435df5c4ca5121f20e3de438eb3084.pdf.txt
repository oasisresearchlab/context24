But cells also soften upon stretch [ 4 , 5 ] . We call this the stiffening - softening paradox of cell mechanics , since both apparently contradictory effects are attributed to the same structural entity or ‘‘functional module’’ [ 6 ] of the cell , the cytoskeleton [ 7 ] . The cytoskeleton is essentially a semidilute meshwork of semiflexible biopolymers , calling for an explanation by a mechanistic polymer - physics based model [ 8 , 9 ] . Indeed , in - vitro reconstituted cytoskeletal networks were also found to stiffen [ 10 – 12 ] and soften [ 12 ] . Within the classical mechanical paradigm of cells and biopolymer networks as viscoelastic bodies , such contradictory responses constitute a paradox , as they elude attempts of a unified explanation . Accordingly , the different behaviors were previously attributed to distinct network architec - tures [ 10 ] . In the following , we want to challenge this view by revealing that even a passive in - vitro cytoskeletal model network exhibits a two - faced mechanical response . Using a simple mathematical model for the inelastic mechanics of a transiently crosslinked biopolymer network , we explain how the apparently paradoxical behavior may naturally emerge from a unified mechanism . Taken together , our results thus show a plausible way of how to resolve the stiffening - softening paradox within a unified framework of inelastic network mechanics , with important implications for cell function , development , and disease [ 13 , 14 ] . We performed shear rheometry with a biomimetic cytoskeletal model system , an F - actin network isotropically and transiently crosslinked by rigor heavy meromyosin ( HMM ) . The F - actin / HMM system was chosen for its structural simplicity and experimental reproducibility , not for its physiological significance . Its frequency - dependent linear rheology has been well charac - terized before [ 15 ] . Our aim was to demonstrate that even such simple model networks , which are arguably accessible to a schematic mathematical modeling , exhibit a complex two - faced nonlinear rheological response akin to that reported for living cells . Results Nonlinear Rheology of F - actin / HMM Networks We applied a staircase of sinusoidal shear excitations . For small amplitude ^ cc , the resulting stress - strain curves have elliptical shapes ( Fig . 1a ) . This means that the stress response s ( t ) is sinusoidal , like the stimulus c ( t ) , but shifted in phase , as characteristic of a linear viscoelastic ( dissipative ) response . Upon raising the oscillation amplitude ^ cc step by step after every 30 cycles ( Fig . 2a ) , deviations from the elliptical shape become increasingly pronounced ( Fig . 1b ) , in line with previous observations for F - actin / a - actinin networks [ 16 ] and even pure F - actin solutions [ 17 ] . Within each cycle , the material stiffens appreciably , which manifests itself in convex stress - strain relations , i . e . the ellipses bending upwards . This is the equilibrium viscoelastic stiffening commonly attributed to the nonlinear resistance of individual semiflexible polymers to stretch [ 9 – 11 , 18 ] . But note that , at the same time , the sample exhibits PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 July 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 7 | e40063 signatures of softening near the maximum strain ^ cc , where the stress - strain curves become concave . As a consequence of such repeated softening phases , the maximum stress ^ ss reached in subsequent identical loading cycles decreases continuously until the stress - strain curve settles on a limit cycle . This phenomenon , known as ‘‘shakedown’’ or dynamic softening , is the hallmark of inelastic behavior . To better illustrate how stiffening and dynamic softening interfere , we reduce the full information contained in the nonlinear stress - strain curves in Fig . 1 by introducing a reduced description in terms of the maximum amplitudes ^ ss n and ^ cc n of stress and strain , respectively , for each cycle n . Their ratio ^ KK ( n ) : ^ ss n = ^ cc n defines a nonlinear modulus as a function of the oscillation frequency and the cycle number n , hence of the cycle - to - cycle history of the sample . It captures the essence of stiffening and dynamic softening , while discarding some finer details encoded in the individual stress - strain cycles . The oscillatory staircase protocol with its monotonically increasing amplitude ^ cc ( Fig . 2a ) results in a non - monotonic evolution of ^ KK ( Fig . 2b ) . One can distinguish a ‘‘transient response’’ to sudden steps in the driving amplitude ^ cc – – generically a rapid stiffening followed by a gradual shakedown – – from a ‘‘stationary response’’ prospectively attained when the shakedown has ceased after many identical driving cycles . Note that this implies that the modulus ^ KK ( n ) reveals underlying dynamics on multiple time scales . It is a non - monotonic function of the cycle number n both for the transient and for the stationary response . Such behavior could not easily be explained by a mere elastic stiffening [ 18 – 20 ] or softening [ 21 , 22 ] , alone . It finds a very natural interpretation in terms of an inelastic response , though . To demonstrate this , we adopted a cell rheology protocol aimed at isolating the inelastic contributions to the response by minimizing viscoelastic contributions [ 4 ] . The protocol consists of a transient shear pulse of a given amplitude , followed by a recovery phase during which the linear mechanical material properties are monitored over time , as illustrated in the inset of Fig . 3 . The main figure depicts the dynamic evolution of the sample stiffness , characterized by the linear storage modulus G ’ ( v ) , after the application of the strain pulse . Right after the pulse , the stiffness of the F - actin / HMM networks is systematically reduced . Similarly to what was previously reported for cells , the effect is sensitive to the amplitude of the pulse ( at fixed duration ) , and the mechanical recovery is slow . The softening is moreover accompanied by an increase in the loss angle ( see Fig . F in Supporting Information S1 ) . In accordance with the cell - mechanical terminology we thus speak of ‘‘fluidization’’ [ 4 , 23 ] . Figure 1 . Stress - strain curves for an oscillatory shear strain ª ( t ) ~ ^ ªª sin ( v t ) . ( a , b ) Experiment : passive transient F - actin / HMM gels ( c A ~ 0 : 4 mg / ml , c HMM = c A ~ 0 : 1 ) sheared at strain amplitudes of ^ cc ~ 5 % and ^ cc ~ 28 % , corresponding to a weakly / strongly non - linear response , respectively . The upward bending of the ellipses signals stiffening , their concave regions near maximum strain imply softening . The softening and the ensuing ‘‘shakedown’’ of the stress - strain curves towards a limit cycle are indicative of inelastic fluidization . ( c , d ) Corresponding theory curves from the inelastic glassy wormlike chain ( i G WLC ) model [ 25 ] ( parameters f 0 ~ 0 , E ~ 10 , U ~ 0 : 8 , v ~ 10 Hz ; single - polymer displacement and force were converted to network strain and stress as described in Methods ) . The absolute stress and strain scales in theory and experiment are compatible on the present ( mean - field ) level of modeling , but the theory somewhat overestimates the stiffening during the initial large - amplitude loading cycle , and , as a consequence , also the peak force and the strength of the shakedown . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0040063 . g001 The Stiffening - Softening Paradox in Cell Mechanics PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 2 July 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 7 | e40063 Mathematical Model The notion of fluidization unifies four of the features described so far : the dynamic softening or shakedown ( Figs . 1 , 2 ) , the reduction and slow recovery of the modulus after stretch ( Fig . 3 ) , and the stationary softening observed in Fig . 2 over long times . For the physical origin of fluidization the transient breaking of weak bonds provides a plausible microscopic mechanism [ 24 ] . To support this interpretation , we now turn to a quantitative analysis of our data , based on the inelastic glassy wormlike chain model [ 25 ] . The glassy wormlike chain ( G WLC ) model is a minimalistic phenomenological model for the Brownian dynam - ics of biopolymer solutions . It is rooted in the standard polymer - physics model for a semiflexible chain molecule in solution , the wormlike chain ( W LC ) . But it effectively accounts also for the caging and enthalpic trapping of such a polymer by the surrounding polymer matrix , resulting in a microscopic mechan - ical susceptibility a (cid:2) GWLC ( v ; f 0 , E ) , depending on the frequency v , prestressing force f 0 , and a stretching parameter E , interpreted as a characteristic bond breaking enthalpy in units of the thermal energy k B T . The W LC and the G WLC can parametrize a wealth of mechanical data obtained in single molecule experiments [ 26 ] and rheometric measurements of biopolymer solutions , networks and cells [ 27 ] . The inelastic G WLC ( i G WLC ) adds to this an effective description of bond kinetics [ 25 ] , i . e . it is applicable to nonequilibrium situations characterized by an appreciable dynamical evolution of the bond network mutually connecting the polymers ( see Fig . D in Supporting Information S1 for an illustrative sketch ) . This is realized by introducing a dependence of the microscopic susceptibility a (cid:2) on the mean fraction n of closed bonds , a (cid:2) iGWLC : a (cid:2) iGWLC ( v ; f 0 , E , n ) . To keep the model as simple as possible , we limit our discussions to ‘‘inelastic’’ ( as opposed to ‘‘plastic’’ ) deformations by requiring reversible binding - unbinding kinetics . Broken bonds ultimately reform in their original equilibrium states after the external load has been released . This means that we refrain , at the present stage , from distinguishing between the breaking of sacrificial bonds that triggers a transient domain unfolding [ 28 ] and the breaking and reforming of cytoskeletal filaments [ 29 ] or the unbinding and rebinding of their mutual sticky contacts [ 30 ] , crosslinkinking molecules [ 15 , 16 ] , or actin - myosin cross bridges [ 31 ] .

Note that the modulus responds nonmonotonically to both transient and stationary loading , hinting at antagonistic mechanisms with multiple time scales .

For the sake of our present discussion , its essential predictions for the shear modulus G are ( i ) a roughly linear increase with prestress if bond - breaking is negligible , G ( v 0 ; f 0 , E , n ) D n : const : * f 0 , ( ii ) a reciprocal relation to the number of bonds at constant stress , G ( v 0 ; f 0 , E , n ) D f 0 : const : * n { x , with x w 0 , and ( iii ) bond softening under stress . The latter is implemented by a Bell - type exponential force dependence of the bond opening and closing rates , k { ( f ) * e f D x b = k B T , k z ( f ) * e { f D x u = k B T with the widths D x b and D x u of the bound and unbound state . Discussion The interplay between the nonlinear mechanical response of individual polymers and the slow but stress - sensitive bond dynamics gives rise to a rich and complex mechanical behavior of the i G WLC . It naturally predicts the bent stress - strain curves and their softening characteristics and gradual shakedown , as exem - plified in Fig . 1d , and the fluidization and slow recovery after a transient strain pulse ( Fig . 3 , lines ) . Even the stiffness evolution on multiple time scales , depicted in Fig . 2 , is well reproduced by the model ( inset ) . Here , we always considered the prestressing force f 0 as a ( small ) constant . It represents frozen - in stresses in the network , which are supposedly weak for our passive reversibly crosslinked networks . But we note in passing that f 0 might play a much more dynamic role in applications of the i G WLC to cell rheological data , where it might under certain circumstances be needed to represent an active contractile cell response . Beyond providing an economical parametrization of our own data and known literature results [ 4 , 5 , 10 – 12 , 30 , 32 ] , the i G WLC makes a plausible and intuitive quantitative proposal for the underlying molecular mechanism . More precisely , by analyzing the model equations , stiffening can be attributed directly to the characteristic nonlinear stretch response of individual semiflexible biopolymers , causing a prompt viscoelastic response to an applied stress . Softening emerges as an aftermath to an applied strain from the slow and stress - sensitive dynamical evolution of the mutual bonds between the biopolymers , and is therefore better charac - terized as an inelastic fluidization . The time - scale separation between viscoelastic stiffening and bond softening turns out to be at the heart of the observed complex nonlinear dynamical response , because large internal stresses can build up before eventually relaxing via inelastic bond breaking . The stationary effects , in contrast , rely on a static balance between polymeric stiffening and bond breaking . The model quantitatively relates these essential properties to each other and also to other characteristic features of the mechanical response of biopolymer networks and cells . For example , scale - free power - law spectra , as observed in cell rheology [ 33 ] , are a characteristic feature of the model ( see Ref . [ 27 ] and Supporting Information S1 ) . Finally , the i G WLC makes a number of interesting testable predictions for future investigations . For instance , as a direct consequence of the Bell - type stress - dependence of the bond strength , we find that the peak force reached in a large strain ramp or pulse grows essentially logarithmically with the characteristic rate at which the force increases . Conversely , the fraction of broken bonds – – and there - fore the resulting fluidization of the sample – – is quite insensitive to the duration of the stimulating pulse , over a broad range of time scales . This particular feature has indeed already been demon - strated for live cells [ 5 ] . However , beyond a certain effective ‘‘yield threshold’’ , the bond fraction sensitively depends on the ( imposed or attained ) maximum strain , no matter what the yield force is ( see Supporting Information S1 for a quantitative description ) . The observation that the rate and amplitude of an imposed deformation affect the nonlinear response so differently suggests to delineate a non - equilibrium constitutive diagram in the reduced parameter plane spanned by the rate and amplitude of an imposed deformation ( Fig . 4 central panel ) . The background shading and the small representative stress - strain cycles distinguish domains of deformation rate and amplitude with a qualitatively distinct mechanical response . The limiting behaviors at vanishing rate and vanishing amplitude , i . e . near to the coordinate axes , are further characterized in the side panels ( note the different labelings on their outer axes ) . The upper panel depicts the rate - dependent viscoelastic response for vanishing amplitude , hence essentially the linear frequency - dependent shear modulus on a log - log scale , exhibiting power - law rheology . The left panel ( linear axes ) shows the nonlinear shear modulus in the limit of slow driving . Note the turnabout from inelastic stiffening to softening in response to a quasi - static driving , which is responsible for the initially ascending and later descending plateaus in the nonlinear modulus ^ KK ( n ) in Fig . 2 . This non - monotonic stationary stress - stiffness relation originates in the sigmoidal sensitivity of the bond fraction to the force ( see Supporting Information S1 ) . For slightly larger rates , the stiffening becomes steeper , which gives rise to a ‘‘kinematic - hardening’’ type behavior ( central panel ) . Finally , if the deforma - tion rate and amplitude of the loading are both large , the response features steep initial stress stiffening and ensuing dynamic fluidization , as caused by the amplitude steps in Fig . 2 , as well as the fluidization - recovery pattern illustrated in Fig . 3 . The depicted representative stress - strain cycle exhibits shakedown , as in Fig . 1 . Though it should not be confused with a thermodynamic state diagram , the constitutive diagram in the central panel of Fig . 4 , if judiciously interpreted , can serve as a compact characterization of the multifaceted nonlinear mechanical re - sponse of transiently crosslinked biopolymer networks and as a potentially useful road map for cell rheologists . In summary , we have explored the stiffening - softening paradox of cell mechanics , both by rheological measurements of minimal Figure 3 . Fluidization and slow mechanical recovery of an F - actin / HMM gel after a transient strain pulse ª ( t ) ( inset ) . Stiffness is quantified by the normalized ( ‘‘n’’ ) real part G ’ ( v ) of the linear shear modulus , measured by small sinusoidal oscillations at fixed oscillation frequency v ~ 1 s { 1 , before and after the stretch . The softening immediately after the stretch is found to be sensitive to the maximum strain ^ cc ~ 10 % ( circles ) and ^ cc ~ 30 % ( squares ) of the pulse , albeit less pronounced as for cells , where the same pattern is observed at 3 – 4 times smaller strain amplitudes [ 4 ] . Error bars are SE , ensemble size is N ~ 75 ; lines represent theoretical ( exponential ) fits by the i G WLC model [ 25 ] ; see Methods and Supporting Information S1 for further explana - tions . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0040063 . g003 The Stiffening - Softening Paradox in Cell Mechanics PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 4 July 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 7 | e40063 cytoskeletal model systems ( F - actin / HMM ) and by theory . The nonlinear nonequilibrium mechanical response of the reconstitut - ed networks was found to provide a close match to previous cell rheological measurements , albeit at 3 – 4 times larger amplitude . It was moreover well parametrized by the inelastic glassy wormlike chain model , which suggests a unified mechanistic explanation . Stiffening , as a direct viscoelastic response to an applied stress , is attributed to the characteristic nonlinear stretch resistance of individual semiflexible biopolymers . Conversely , softening emerg - es as an aftermath to an applied strain from the dynamical evolution of the mutual bonds between the biopolymers , and it is better characterized as an inelastic fluidization . By emphasizing the key role played by inelastic processes , the proposed polymer - physics based explanation of the stiffening - softening paradox clearly transcends the classical mechanical paradigm of biopoly - mer networks and cells as viscoelastic bodies . Our unifying explanation based upon inelastic processes is specific concerning the basic mechanism , yet robust against details of its implemen - tation . It makes reference to microscopic elements in the molecular structure of the cytoskeleton , such as biopolymers and their mutual transient bonds , and relates them quantitatively to a wide range of rheological responses . It would also be straightfor - ward to accommodate more sophisticated physical constituents accounting for dynamic prestresses generated by molecular motors , stress - induced domain unfolding , or catch bonds . In the minimalistic implementation discussed here , our model is , at the same time , still schematic and deliberately employs bold simpli - fications . In particular , it does not address network and cross - linking geometries , nor is it parametrically fine - tuned to a particular molecular architecture , as would be required for extracting reliable parameter values ( such as binding affinities of crosslinkers ) from fits to experimental data . In return , one may hope that it can qualitatively capture major elements of the mechanical phenomenology of both networks and cells , irrespective of their utterly different degrees of molecular complexity . Methods Protein Preparation and Rheology Passive rigor F - actin / HMM networks at various concentrations were prepared as previously described [ 34 ] , except that no gelsolin was added . Nonlinear oscillatory experiments were performed at actin concentration c A ~ 0 : 4 mg / ml and HMM molar ratio R ~ c H MM = c A ~ 0 : 1 . Data for pulsed loading were pooled over two different actin concentrations c A ~ 0 : 4 mg / ml and c A ~ 0 : 8 mg / ml and values of R , 0 ƒ R ƒ 0 : 2 , see Table A in Supporting Information S1 for details . We used a commercial AR G2 shear rheometer ( TA Instruments , New Castle , USA ) in cone - plate geometry ( 40 mm diameter , cone opening angle 1 u ) . About 370 m l sample were loaded within 1 minute into the rheometer . The transition to rigor HMM upon ATP depletion is followed by recording the elastic response of the F - actin / HMM network over time ( see Fig . B in Supporting Information S1 ) . Two different rheological protocols were applied . The first protocol , termed ‘‘nonlinear oscillations’’ , consisted of shear oscillations at 0 . 025 Hz with a staircase increase in the amplitude . The amplitude was kept constant for 30 cycles and then increased to a higher value , where it again was kept constant for 30 cycles , and so forth . Amplitude Figure 4 . Constitutive diagram for the iGWLC model . The central panel gives a qualitative graphical summary of the mechanical response predicted by the model as a function of the amplitude and characteristic rate of an imposed deformation pulse . At low amplitudes , in the linear regime , it exhibits power - law rheology ( upper panel , log - log scale ) . At low rates , in the quasistatic regime , it exhibits stiffening at low amplitudes , where entropic stiffening of the polymer backbone dominates , and softening at high amplitudes , where the stiffening is eventually overruled by the exponential bond softening ( left panel , linear scale ) . This mechanism underlies the initially ascending and later descending steps in the nonlinear modulus in Fig . 2 . At high rates and high amplitudes , a steep initial stiffening with subsequent fluidization and slow recovery governs the response ( central panel ) . The schematic stress - strain curves for oscillatory driving exemplify the salient features of the nonlinear response in the various parameter regions . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0040063 . g004 The Stiffening - Softening Paradox in Cell Mechanics PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 5 July 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 7 | e40063 values were 5 % , 9 % , 16 % , 28 % , and 40 % ( cf . Fig . 2a ) . The second protocol , termed ‘‘fluidization protocol’’ , was chosen to specifically probe the inelastic contribution to the response , as pioneered in cell rheology [ 4 ] . A triangular shear pulse of four minutes duration and variable amplitude was applied to the sample , followed by a waiting time of at least 20 minutes . During the waiting time , the linear frequency - dependent modulus was constantly recorded by applying small shear oscillations of 1 % amplitude at frequencies of 2 Hz ( cf . Fig . 3 ) . Data Analysis For the nonlinear oscillations , raw data were extracted from the rheometer . Spline smoothing was applied to the data using a custom - made Python script . Torque t and angle h were converted to stress s and strain c using s ~ c s t and c ~ c c h , with conversion factors of c s ~ 1 : 2 | 10 5 = m 3 and c c ~ 57 : 3 , respectively , which are calculated from the cone geometry . From the resulting stress - strain data , a nonlinear modulus ^ KK was calculated as described in the main text . The response to the nonlinear oscillations was qualitatively reproducible among different samples ( Fig . E in Supporting Information S1 ) . No averaging over samples was performed . To relate theoretically calculated filament forces f to network strains s , we used the relation [ 35 ] s & f = j 2 , with the mesh size [ 36 ] j ~ 0 : 3 = ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ c A ½ mg = ml (cid:3) p ; an estimate for the strain was obtained by normalizing the displacement by the mesh size j . For the pulsed loading experiments , the linear stiffness responded to a strain pulse by a systematic decrease followed by a recovery . Often , the recovery did not reach the pre - shear value . The failure to fully recover is probably due to slow , uncontrolled network reorganization processes , because , independent of the shear pulses , the modulus always exhibited a slow , nearly linear drift ( Fig . B in Supporting Information S1 ) . To correct for this ‘‘background drift’’ , the data were parametrized by a linear function f l ( t ) ~ b z S at late times w 13 min , where all curves were to a good approximation linear in time . The data were then normalized by this linear asymptote ( Fig . C in Supporting Information S1 ) , G ’ n ( t ) : G ’ ( t ) = f l ( t ) and then averaged over N ~ 75 samples . Statistical analysis of the recovery data was performed using a Monte - Carlo resampling bootstrapping method , as described in the following . For each time step , the respective values of N ~ 75 normalized experimental curves were pooled . A resampled curve was created by drawing ( with replacement ) one value from this pool for every time step . To a total of 1000 resampled recovery curves , exponential functions . g ( t ; a , t r ) ~ 1 { e { t = t r : ( 1 { a ) ð 1 Þ were fitted , with the value a of the normalized stiffness after stimulus cessation and recovery time t r . We obtained a ~ 0 : 93 + 0 : 005 and t r ~ ( 240 + 20 ) s for 10 % pulse amplitude and a ~ 0 : 85 + 0 : 006 and t r ~ ( 300 + 10 ) s for 30 % pulse ampli - tude . Errors are standard errors of the mean . Note that the recovery time for the large pulse is larger than the respective time for the small pulse . This behavior is actually expected from theoretical considerations ( Supporting Information S1 ) . Model The inelastic glassy wormlike chain ( i G WLC ) [ 25 ] is an extension of the ( equilibrium ) glassy wormlike chain ( G WLC ) model , which , in turn , is a phenomenological extension of the wormlike chain ( W LC ) , the standard coarse - grained mathematical description of an individual semiflexible polymer in solution [ 37 ] . Beyond the common W LC , the equilibrium G WLC phenomenologically ac - counts for the caging and trapping of a test polymer by the surrounding polymer network . The corresponding slowdown of the long wavelength bending undulations of the polymer backbone is , in mathematical terms , represented by a stretching of the ordinary W LC relaxation spectrum . Beyond a characteristic minimum interaction wavelength L ( on the order of the entanglement length ) the relaxation times t n of all W LC modes n of wavelength l n are modified by a mode - dependent Arrhenius factor t n ? ~ tt n ~ t n l n v L t n exp E ( l n = L { 1 ) ½ (cid:3) l n § L (cid:3) : ð 2 Þ This modification of the relaxation spectrum gives rise to a dramatic slowdown of the dynamics at long times or small frequencies [ 37 ] , producing power - law rheology with a small apparent power - law exponent 3 = E [ 27 ] , as ubiquitously observed for cells [ 7 ] . A pertinent example for an observable characterizing the mechanical response under an optional prestressing force f is the complex microscopic susceptibility to transverse displacements [ 37 ] , given by a f ( v ) ~ L 3 k B Tl p p 4 X ? n ~ 1 1 ( n 4 z n 2 f = f L ) ( 1 z i v ~ tt n ) , ð 3 Þ with the polymer length L , persistence length l p , Euler buckling force f L , and thermal energy k B T . In the limit of infinitely long polymers , the expression becomes independent of the length and can be converted to an integral . Note that equation ( 3 ) implicitly depends on L and therefore is better written as a f ( v ) : a ( v ; f , L ) . To evaluate the force response to a given strain stimulus c ( t ) in linear response , a superposition principle can be used , f ( t ; f , L ) ~ 1 ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2 p p ð ? { ? F { 1 a { 1 v , f , L ½ (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:5) ( t { t ’ ) c ( t ’ ) dt ’ , ð 4 Þ where F { 1 denotes the inverse Fourier transform . In the inelastic G WLC ( i G WLC ) model , we interpret L as the average backbone length between adjacent bonds of the test chain with the background network , and E as the height of the free energy barrier ( in units of thermal energy ) that has to be overcome to break a bond . In contrast to the equilibrium G WLC , L is not assumed to be a fixed equilibrium quantity L 0 , but is allowed to evolve with time ( Fig . D in Supporting Information S1 ) . It is related to the state variable n ( t ) , describing the mean fraction of closed bonds ( or ‘‘bond fraction’’ ) at a given time t , by L ( t ) ~ L 0 = n ( t ) . The equilibrium G WLC is recovered as the special case of a fixed average bond fraction n ( t ) : 1 . The bond fraction evolves according to a simple generic first - order kinetic equation , _ nn ( t ) ~ { k { ( f ) : n ( t ) z k z ( f ) : ½ 1 { n ( t ) (cid:3) ~ { k { ( f ) z k z ( f ) ½ (cid:3) : n ( t ) z k z ( f ) , ð 5 Þ where k { ( f ) and k z ( f ) are force - dependent off - and on rates , respectively . The transition rates are taken to depend exponen - tially on the polymer backbone tension f in the standard way [ 38 ] , The Stiffening - Softening Paradox in Cell Mechanics PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 6 July 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 7 | e40063 k { t 0 ~ e { E z D xbf , k z t 0 ~ e { E z U { D xuf , ð 6 Þ where t 0 is a characteristic time scale that depends on the properties of the binding potential , D x b and D x u are the widths of potential wells corresponding to the bound and unbound state , respectively , and e U is the relative binding affinity [ 38 , 39 ] . To summarize , the model combines two fundamental nonlinear mechanical paradigms , namely single - polymer stiffening and a transient bond softening under load . The resulting nonlinear response is evaluated numerically using a nonlinear update scheme implemented in C + + . In brief , in each time step t , the bond fraction n ( t ) is updated according to equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) and the force history f ( t ) . Both n ( t ) and f ( t ) then determine the G WLC response , at a given time t , via the G WLC mode spectrum ~ tt n [ 25 ] .
