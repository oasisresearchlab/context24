It may also be involved when membrane ruffles engulf external fluid during macropinocytosis 2 . Here we show that , in cells transfected with a fusion protein consisting of green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) and b - actin , pinosomes ( vesicles used for fluid uptake ) ignite a burst of actin polymerization when they are pinched off from the plasma membrane . Pinosomes then move into the cytosol at the tips of short - lived actin ‘comet tails’ that are similar to those that propel Listeria 3 and other microorganisms 4 , 5 through infected cells . Like Listeria , pinosomes appear to carry the machinery required for propulsive actin polymerization . The direction of pinosome move - ment indicates that they may acquire this machinery from the crests of membrane ruffles . We suggest that actin polymerization moves the leading edge of ruffles . Endocytic vesicles may also use actin polymerization to move into the cytosol after being pinched off from the plasma membrane . We transfected rat basophilic leukaemia ( RBL ) cells with GFP - labelled b - actin 6 and allowed them to ruffle and undergo macropi - nocytosis in a mildly hyperosmolar medium 7 . Ruffles faintly aglow with GFP – actin engulfed fluid and formed vesicular structures near the plasma membrane ( not shown ) . The structures fluoresced ( Fig . 1a , arrowhead ) as they ignited a burst of actin polymerization that caused a streak of actin to move through the cell , much like actin ‘comet tails’ . The tips of the actin tails were cup - shaped as if to accommodate vesicles , and appeared to push spherical objects that were visible as dark shadows . Large tails sometimes appeared hollow ( not shown ) . The results shown in Fig . 1a were recorded by evanescent field fluorescence microscopy ( EFM ) 8 , a technique that selectively images the bottom of cells where they adhere to a glass coverslip . Some actin tails seemed to originate in the middle of the cell in such recordings ; such tails were also seen when the bottom of chemically fixed cells was viewed by laser - scanning confocal microscopy ( LSCM ) . However , three - dimensional images of such tails recon - structed from serial confocal sections showed them to extend to the plasma membrane above ( data not shown ) . In four cells analysed in this way , the appearance of all tails was consistent with the tails hav - ing begun at the plasma membrane . To characterize the motion of actin tails , we recorded video clips by EFM and plotted the speed of actin tails as a histogram ( Fig . 1b ) . The speed at the peak of the histogram ( 0 . 2 m m s - 1 ; mean 0 . 24 m m s - 1 ) was comparable to results obtained with Listeria 9 ( 0 . 23 m m s - 1 ) and Shigella 4 ( 0 . 1 m m s - 1 ) . We also measured the fluores - cence at a fixed point on an actin tail and watched it dim as the tail moved on and the actin depolymerized . Tails dimmed with half - lives of 20 s ( Fig . 1c ) , values that are again comparable with those obtained for Listeria 3 ( 33 s ) and Shigella 10 ( 38 s ) . Actin tails thus appear to exhibit the same speed and persistence regardless of whether they propel pinosomes or bacteria .

Mean speed was 0 . 24 – 0 . 10 m m s - 1 ( – s . d . ) . Actin tails persist for some time after they have stopped moving ; the speed of such ‘spent’ actin tails ( 0 – 0 . 05 m m s - 1 ) was not included in the histogram or the mean , as it would result in a large bar at the origin . We made 699 measurements of 126 actin tails in 9 cells ; results were recorded as in a . c , Average fluorescence in a region of interest ( ROI , see inset ) measured in successive frames and plotted against time .

Under more physiological conditions , tails may be shorter and even less persistent , making them harder to see and causing endosomes to move more slowly 2 or for less time . The limited lifetime of actin tails indicates that actin polymerization may be regulated during pinocytosis . To identify the cargo carried by actin tails , we added rhodamine - labelled dextran to the external medium and studied live cells in equatorial sections by LSCM . Cells contained red , dextran - contain - ing pinosomes ( 42 . 0 – 2 . 9 per section and cell ) , of which 20 . 4 – 6 . 2 % were associated with a green tail ( consisting of GFP – actin ) during 250 s of observation ( Fig . 2a ) . At least 90 % of the tails ( 62 of 69 in 7 cells ) had red pinosomes at their tips . The actual percentage of tails carrying pinosomes is probably higher , as very small vesicles must be well in focus to be seen and it is possible that the tips of some actin tails were never in focus during the observation time . Fig . 2b shows the plasma membrane invaginating to engulf fluid in a pinosome . An actin tail was initiated between the plasma mem - brane and the pinosome , and moved inward and out of the focal plane . The pinosome beneath the plasma membrane vanished , pre - sumably carried away by the actin tail . Actin tails thus appear to begin at plasma - membrane sites of pinosome formation . For one cell , speeds of pinosomes were measured over 250 s and plotted as a histogram ( Fig . 2c ) . Pinosomes moved rapidly only when associ - ated with an actin tail . To determine whether actin tails were an artefact of transfection or GFP expression , we studied fixed , untransfected cells . Pinosomes were labelled by letting cells take up fluorescent immunoglobulin E bound to Fc e RI receptors on the plasma membrane , and F - actin was labelled with fluorescent phalloidin . Phalloidin easily stained actin tails . Cells were viewed by LSCM in equatorial sections that were focused as much as possible on the tips of tails ( Fig . 2d ) . Of 84 actin tails in 50 cells , 78 clearly carried pinosomes and only 2 clearly did not . Thus actin tails also occur in untransfected cells , and most or all carry pinosomes at their tips . To determine whether pinosomes depart from the plasma mem - brane in a preferred direction , we studied actin tails that touched the plasma membrane ( 29 of 84 ) . We measured the angles of these tails in relation to the plasma membrane ( Fig . 2d ) and plotted them as a histogram ( Fig . 2e ) . Most tails ( 26 of 29 ) pointed towards the cytosol , and 23 of these were within 45 (cid:176) of being perpendicular to the membrane . Thus , actin tails do not form at random angles with the plasma membrane ( P < 0 . 001 , Komolgoroff – Smirnov test ) . We have shown that pinosomes ignite transient bursts of actin polymerization after they pinch off from the plasma membrane , and that they then move into the cytosol at the tip of the resulting actin ‘comet tails’ . Comet tails have previously been seen in associ - ation with ‘rocketing endosomes’ in intact , uninfected , La 3 + - and Ni 2 + - treated cells 12 and , most recently , with Golgi - derived clathrin - coated vesicles in intact , uninfected HeLa cells 13 . We have shown now that actin tails in RBL cells are associated specifically with mov - ing pinosomes . These tails are similar or identical to those that pro - pel Listeria and Shigella , in both their speed and their persistence . In Listeria , movement is thought to result from propulsive actin polymerization 3 and the same may apply to pinocyte movement . Our results show that the machinery for propulsive actin polym - erization is concentrated in ruffles . Ruffles must carry this machin - Figure 2 Actin tails propel pinosomes . a , A GFP – actin - expressing cell in external medium containing 4 mg ml - 1 Texas - Red - conjugated dextran ( Molecular Probes ) .

Most pinosomes have a region in which this machinery is more active than else - where , because uniform actin polymerization over the entire pino - some surface would prohibit movement . ( Indeed , rare pinosomes that show GFP – actin fluorescence around their entire circumfer - ence do not move ; data not shown . ) This more active region must usually be the ‘navel’ ( the point at which the pinosome pinched off from the plasma membrane ) , because most pinosomes move nearly vertically into the cytosol . The consistent localization of actin polymerization on the pinosome can be explained most simply if the machinery for actin polymerization is most active at the crests of ruffles ( Fig . 2f – h ) . Its presence there strengthens the idea that ruffles extend by a mechanism involving actin polymerization . After budding from the plasma membrane , pinosomes and endocytic vesicles must generally move into the cytosol for process - ing . Actin is widely thought to participate in endocytosis 7 , 15 – 17 . We propose that one of actin’s functions in both endocytosis and pino - cytosis may be to help endocytic vesicles and pinosomes move into the cytosol , by means of a brief burst of actin polymerization . h Methods Cells . Human b - actin was fused to the carboxy terminus of EGFP ( Clontech ) and expressed under control of the long b - actin promoter as described 6 . RBL cells were grown to confluence at 37 (cid:176) C and in 5 % CO 2 in RPMI medium ( Sigma ) . For transfection , they were collected from 90 - mm dishes by scraping , washed three times in HBS ( 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 1 . 8 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 8 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM HEPES , 1 mM glucose , pH 7 . 4 ) , suspended in 0 . 4 ml HBS and electroporated with 30 m g vector . Cells were then plated onto flamed glass coverslips and used 24 – 48 h later . For imaging , glass coverslips with adherent cells were transferred to the experimental chamber containing HBS supplemented with either 10 nM PMA or 150 mM sucrose or both , as indicated . They were imaged 15 – 30 min later and kept at 37 (cid:176) C throughout . Imaging . Cells were observed with an epi - illumination evanescent - field microscope that selectively illuminated a thin layer of cytosol where cells adhered to the glass coverslip 8 . Even in thick cells the method avoids exciting significant out - of - focus fluorescence , so that all fluorescent light returning through the objective can be used for imaging and none is lost at the pinhole of a confocal microscope . Up to 200 images were taken with a back - illuminated cooled charge - coupled - device camera ( Princeton Instruments ) at 0 . 2 Hz from single cells without significant bleaching or photodamage . Movements observed are projections of three - dimensional trajectories into the plane of the coverslip . For simultaneous viewing of two fluoro - phores in living cells , we used a Leica TCS - NT confocal microscope ( · 100 , 1 . 3 NA oil objective ) . Closed experimental chambers were made of a microscope slide , a piece of parafilm and a coverslip with adher - ent cells , and sealed with silicone grease . Up to 50 images were taken at 0 . 2 Hz with the confocal pinhole opened to increase light collection . Throughout , the microscope or microscope stage , specimen and objective were placed in an enclosure and maintained at 37 (cid:176) C . Images were analysed with MetaMorph ( Universal Imaging ) ; the resulting numerical data were analysed in Origin ( MicroCal ) . Immunofluorescence . For immunofluorescence , untransfected RBL cells were washed at room temperature to remove medium and then incubated for 30 min ( 4 (cid:176) C ) in hyperosmolar HBS with 10 nM PMA and 2 m g ml - 1 anti - DNP - IgE ( Sigma ) conjugated to Alexa - 568 ( Molecular Probes ) . Alexa - 568 – IgE binds to the Fc e RI receptor and is internalized in pinosomes . Cells were washed thrice in HBS ( 4 (cid:176) C ) , placed in stimulation buffer ( 15 min at 37 (cid:176) C ) , then fixed in PBS ( Sigma ) plus 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde ( 15 min ) , permeabilized with PBS + 0 . 1 % Triton - X100 ( 2 min ) and stained for F - actin in PBS + 20 U ml - 1 Oregon - green – phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) for 60 min ( all at 20 (cid:176) C ) . Cells were then viewed by LSCM with the pinhole stopped down to maximize resolution . Serial confocal sections of phalloidin - stained cells were deconvoluted using the Huygens - 2 software package ( Scientific Volume Imaging , Hilversum , Netherlands ) ; the point spread function was determined by optical serial - sectioning of a fluorescent bead . Vertical sections were calculated using the program Imaris ( Bitplane , Zurich , Switzerland ) . RECEIVED 25 FEBRUARY 1999 ; REVISED 6 APRIL 1999 ; ACCEPTED 6 APRIL 1999 ; PUBLISHED MAY 1999 . 1 .
