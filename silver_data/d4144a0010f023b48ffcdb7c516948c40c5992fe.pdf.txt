The N - terminal half of talin2 is suﬃcient for mouse development and survival Nien - Tsu Chen , Su Hao Lo * Center for Tissue Regeneration and Repair , Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Cancer Center , University of California - Davis , Sacramento , CA 95817 , USA Received 10 September 2005 Available online 26 September 2005 Abstract Using a talin2 gene - trapped embryonic stem cell clone , we have developed a talin2 mutant mouse line that expresses the N - terminal half ( 1 – 1295 ) of talin2 fused with b - galactosidase . The homozygous mutant mice appear to be normal and healthy . In the testis , talin2 expresses as a shorter form with a unique 30 residues at N - terminus linking to a common C - terminus from 1122 to 2453 of the long form . The resulting talin2 in the mutant testis only contains 204 residues of the wild - type testis talin2 . However , it did not seem to aﬀect the morphology of testis or reproduction of male mice . In fact , male and female mutant mice are fertile . Utilizing the expression of talin2 ( 1 – 1295 ) / b - galactosidase fusion protein , we have examined the distribution of talin2 in tissues . In contrast to talin1 , talin2 expression is more restricted in tissues and cell types . (cid:1) 2005 Elsevier Inc . All rights reserved . Keywords : Talin2 ; Focal adhesions ; Gene trap Talin is a large focal adhesion component that interacts with multiple molecules , such as integrins [ 1 – 3 ] , focal adhe - sion kinase ( Fak ) [ 4 ] , vinculin [ 5 ] , layilin [ 6 ] , and actin [ 3 ] . Talin contains a head domain and a rod domain . The head domain ( aa 1 – 433 ) of talin contains binding sites to b inte - grin ( 300 – 400 ) , layilin ( 300 – 400 ) , Fak ( 225 – 357 ) , PIP ki - nase 1 c ( 300 – 400 ) , and actin ( 196 – 400 ) . The rod domain ( 483 – 2541 ) is responsible for the dimerization and contains an actin - binding domain ( 2345 – 2541 ) , a second integrin binding site ( 1984 – 2113 ) , and three vinculin - binding sites ( 607 – 633 , 852 – 876 , and 1944 – 1969 ) . These binding activi - ties allow talin to provide a structural connection between the integrin receptors and the actin cytoskeleton . In addition , talin regulates the ‘‘inside - out’’ integrin activation by binding to integrin tails leading to a higher aﬃnity state [ 7 ] . Recent studies using laser tweezer microscopy have established a critical role of the interaction between talin and actin ﬁlament [ 8 ] . In the experiments , the force re - quired to remove a bead coated with a cell - binding frag - ment of ﬁbronectin from the lamellipodia of a normal ﬁbroblast was measured . Such forces are signiﬁcantly re - duced in talin - null cells but are restored by re - expression of talin . However , re - expression of a talin mutant (cid:1) s lack of the C - terminal actin - binding site cannot restore the force [ 8 ] . These ﬁndings have demonstrated an important role of the talin – actin interaction in strengthening cell adhesion . The critical role of talin in tissue development has been demonstrated by genetic studies using knockdown and knockout approaches . Reduction of talin expression in Caenorhabditis elegans caused severe defects in gonad for - mation because of aberrant distal tip cell migration and also disrupted oocyte maturation and gonad sheath cell structure [ 9 ] . Fly embryos deﬁcient in talin exhibited failure in germ band retraction , muscle detachment , and wing blis - ter [ 10 ] . Both Drosophila and C . elegans talin mutants have very similar phenotypes to those found in integrin 0006 - 291X / $ - see front matter (cid:1) 2005 Elsevier Inc .

Talin knockout in mice leads to embryonic lethality due to impaired cell migration at the gastrulation stage [ 11 ] . These studies have demonstrated that talin plays an essential role in tissue development . A closely related member , talin2 , has been identiﬁed [ 12 ] . Although talin2 is highly homologous to talin ( or talin1 ) , many of its potential binding activities and physiological roles remain to be established . Here , we reported the characterization of mice carrying a b - galacto - sidase insertion at talin2 gene , the distribution of talin2 in various tissues , and the identiﬁcation of a testis splice form of talin2 . Materials and methods Embryonic stem ( ES ) cells and mice . Talin2 in1295 gene - trap SV129 ES cells ( RRI434 ) were obtained from BayGenomics ( UCSF ) and injected into the C57BL / 6 blastocysts . The resulting male chimeras were mated with C57BL / 6 females , and the talin2 in1295 line was subsequently main - tained on a mixed C57BL / 6 : SV129 genetic background . Breeding was carried out under standard animal housing conditions in the UCD animal facility . Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) assay . Mouse tail samples were lysed in lysis buﬀer ( 50 mM Tris – HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM EDTA , pH 8 . 0 , 400 mM NaCl , and 0 . 5 % SDS ) containing 1 mg / ml proteinase K at 55 (cid:2) C for overnight . Primers speciﬁc for mouse talin2 and b - geo were : T2 - F - gcccttccaggaggcccagagtgagc ; T2 - R - tatcacttgcatctg gtcttcttttg and b Geo - R - aattcagacggcaaacgactgtc . The PCR was performed at 94 (cid:2) C for 5 min and followed by 30 cycles at 94 (cid:2) C for 30 s , 65 (cid:2) C for 30 s , and 72 (cid:2) C for 2 min . Equal volume of each PCR product was ana - lyzed by 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis . RNA preparation and Northern blot analysis . Total RNA was isolated from organs using Trizol ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) according to instruction of the manufacturer . For Northern blot analysis , an equal amount ( 15 l g ) of RNAs from various tissues was separated on formal - dehyde agarose gels and hybridized under high - stringency conditions in ExpressHyb hybridization solution ( BD , Palo Alto , CA , USA ) with 32 P - labelled probes at 68 (cid:2) C for overnight . cDNA probes for hybridization were 747 and 658 bp corresponding to mouse talin2 3 0 UTR ( the stop codon and downstream ) and b - Geo , respectively . Western analysis . Fibroblasts were isolated from wild - type and talin2 mutant 14 - day - old embryos as described [ 13 ] . Whole cell lysates ( 500 l g ) were prepared as described [ 14 ] and immunoprecipitated with the anti - b - galactosidase ( b - Gal , 1 : 500 , ICN , Aurora OH , USA ) at 4 (cid:2) C for 1 h . The resulting immunoprecipitates and the whole cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies at the following concen - trations : anti - talin N - terminal ( Talin - N , 1 : 1 : 000 , Sigma , St . Louis , MO , USA ) , anti - talin C - terminal ( Talin - C , 1 : 1000 , Chemicon , Temecula , CA , USA ) , and anti - b - galactosidase ( 1 : 1000 ) . X - gal staining and histology . The brain , heart , eye , lung , kidney , and testis were dissected from talin2 mutant and wild - type mice . The organs were brieﬂy ﬁxed in ﬁxation buﬀer ( 0 . 2 % glutaraldehyde in PBS plus 2 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM EGTA , and 0 . 02 % NP - 40 , pH 7 . 3 ) at 4 (cid:2) C for 4 h . After three washes in PBS , samples were frozen and embedded in OCT ( Sakura Finetek , Torrance CA , USA ) compound . Frozen sections ( 8 – 10 l m ) were prepared and stained for b - galactosidase activity . The sections were washed three times in washing buﬀer ( PBS plus 2 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM EGTA , 0 . 02 % NP - 40 , and 0 . 01 % Na - deoxycholate , pH 7 . 3 ) . The staining was carried out at 37 (cid:2) C for 3 – 6 h in the washing buﬀer supplemented with 1 mg / ml X - gal , 5 mM potassium ferricyanide , and 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide . For histological analysis , tissues were ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde solution , processed , and embedded in paraﬃn . Sections were cut at 5 - l m thickness , rehydrated , and stained with hematoxylin and eosin . Images were observed by Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope . Results Interruption of talin2 gene in mice We have searched the available databases for mouse ta - lin2 gene and two partial cDNA sequences ( GenBank Accession Nos . AF467081 and BC059856 ) were identiﬁed . Together with the talin2 sequence from mouse chromo - some 9 ( XP _ 486227 ) , we have assembled the mouse talin2 cDNA encoding 2453 amino acid residues , which shows 73 % identity ( 85 % similarity ) with mouse talin1 ( 2541 ami - no acids , NM _ 011602 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . By searching the BayGenomics database , we have found three gene - trapped embryonic stem ( ES ) cell lines with a disrupted talin2 gene [ 15 ] . The gene - trap construct which contained a strong splice acceptor was introduced into ES cells and resulted in an insertional mutation in the ta - lin2 gene . Based on the available sequence information of the resulting mRNAs , we have selected the clone , RRI434 , because its insertion site was more upstream than the other two clones ( RRI055 and RRI102 ) . The gene - trap construct was found inserted in the intron between exon 28 and exon 29 of talin2 and we named the allele talin2 in1295 ( for insertion mutant at amino acid residue 1295 ) . This gene - trap insertion mutant was predicted to lead to the expression of talin2 ( 1 – 1295 ) / b - galactosidase fusion pro - teins . Three primers ( T2 - F , T2 - R , and b Geo - R ) were de - signed to analyze the wild - type and the mutant alleles ( Figs . 2A and B ) . The RRI434 ES cells were used to gener - ate germ line chimeras and then heterozygous mutant mice . Crossing between heterozygous mice produced pups with expected Mendelian genotype ratio , indicating that this talin2 mutant did not lead to embryonic lethality . In addi - tion , talin2 homozygous mutant mice were indistinguish - able from heterozygous or wild - type mice . Both male and female homozygous mice were fertile . Histological sections including brain , heart , kidney , testis ( Fig . 3 ) , lung , liver , eye , and spleen ( data not shown ) were carefully examined and no sign of abnormality was found . The oldest mouse examined so far was 9 months old and again no defect was found . Talin2 RNA expression in talin2 mutant mice To conﬁrm whether the gene - trap insertion has disrupt - ed talin2 transcripts , we have analyzed the total RNAs iso - lated from wild - type and mutant tissues by Northern blotting . While strong signals around 9 . 5 and 7 . 5 kb were detected in wild - type brain and heart using a talin2 - speciﬁc 3 0 UTR probe , no band was detected in the brain , heart , and testis of mutant mice ( Fig . 4 ) . In addition , we have identiﬁed strong but shorter bands (cid:1) 4 . 4 kb in wild - type testis and (cid:1) 3 . 5 kb in wild - type and mutant kidneys . A 7 . 5 - kb transcript was also observed in wild - type kidney . When the blot was re - probed for LacZ gene , signals were only detected in the samples from mutant mice . The detec - tion of shorter talin2 transcripts was consistent with N . - T . Chen , S . H . Lo / Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 337 ( 2005 ) 670 – 676 671 previous report [ 12 ] and may represent various alternative splice forms . By using the mouse talin2 sequence around the insertion site as a probe , we have searched the available databases . We found several cDNA sequences isolated from the testis ( for example , GenBank Accession Nos . AK029828 and BB616043 ) that may represent the testis Fig . 1 .

Asterisk ( * ) indicates the site ( aa 1295 ) fused to the b - galactosidase in the mutant ; closed triangle ( m ) shows the site ( aa 1121 ) linked to the testis - speciﬁc 30 amino acids . 672 N . - T . Chen , S . H . Lo / Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 337 ( 2005 ) 670 – 676 splice form of talin2 . This splice form contains extra 251 base pairs encoding a unique 30 amino acid residues ( M 1 DLKIDVSQENIQRPLNVFIKCSQHHY HTS 30 ) at the N - terminus , followed by a sequence identical to the full - length talin2 residues from V 1122 AARET to the end ( Fig . 1 ) . The resulting talin2 in the mutant testis only con - tained 204 residues of the wild - type testis talin2 . However , no defect was found in the mutant testes and mutant mice were fertile . The transcriptional initiation site for the 3 . 5 - kb transcript in the kidney is most likely located at further downstream to the insertion site . Therefore , the expression of this transcript was not aﬀected by the gene - trap insertion and was detected in the mutant RNA sample ( Fig . 4 ) . Talin2 protein expression in talin2 mutant cells Based on the genomic and 5 0 RACE analysis , this gene - trap insertion should lead to the expression of a chimeric protein with the N - terminal portion of talin2 ( residue 1 – 1295 ) fused to the b - galactosidase . To test this , we have isolated ﬁbroblasts from wild - type and mutant embryos for immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses . Since ta - lin2 is highly similar to talin1 ( 74 % identity in human and 73 % identity in mouse ) , there is no talin2 - speciﬁc anti - body available . In fact , most , if not all , talin1 antibodies cross - react with talin2 . We used two talin antibodies , one against the N - terminal , the other against the C - terminal of talin for the assays . While both talin antibodies detected a single band in wild - type and mutant cell lysates , the talin - N antibodies appeared to be more sensitive and showed stronger signals ( Fig . 5 ) . In addition , there was a signiﬁcant reduction in the mutant sample , presumably due to the ablation of talin2 and down - expression of talin1 . When the cell lysates were ﬁrst immunoprecipitated with anti - b - gal antibodies and then probed with various antibodies , only anti - talin - N , but not talin - C , antibodies could recog - nize the protein . These results demonstrated that talin2 was expressed as a talin2 / b - galactosidase fusion protein in the mutant cells . Talin2 tissue expression To investigate the expression of talin2 in various tissues , we have taken advantage of this gene - trap mutant express - ing talin2 ( 1 – 1295 ) / b - galactosidase fusion protein under the endogenous talin2 promoter ( s ) .

As shown in Fig . 6 , X - gal staining was detected in the dendrites of Pur - kinje cells in cerebellum ( Fig . 6A ) ; in myocardium of the heart ( Fig . 6B ) ; in choroidal stroma , pigmented epithelium , external limiting membrane , outer plexiform layer , and internal limiting membrane of the retina ( Fig . 6C ) ; in lung smooth muscle cells around bronchiole and blood vessels ( Fig . 6D ) . The staining was very strong and concentrated in renal tubules ( Fig . 6E ) of papilla and medulla regions , but was dispersed in the cortex ( Fig . 6F ) . In the testis , it was expressed in myoid cells and Leydig cells in 2 - week - old mice ( Fig . 6G ) and also in spermatids in older mice ( Fig . 6H ) . Tissues from wild - type mice did not show any X - gal staining ( data not shown ) . Interestingly , most of the staining was concentrated on the basement membrane of the cells , suggesting that talin2 , like talin1 , was localized to the cell – matrix junctions and the N - terminal half of ta - lin2 is suﬃcient for this localization .

Lo / Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 337 ( 2005 ) 670 – 676 Discussion In addition to the mouse , the existence of a second talin gene was reported in humans [ 12 ] and Dictyostelium [ 16 ] . We also found partial sequences of talin2 in chimpanzee ( Pan troglodytes ) , rat ( Rattus norvegicus ) , cow ( Bos taurus ) , dog ( Canis familiaris ) , red jungle fowl ( Gallus gallus ) , and zebraﬁsh ( Danio rerio ) from EST databases . Their derived amino acid sequences are extremely conserved . For exam - ple , human ( NM _ 015059 ) , rat ( XP _ 236367 ) , and mouse are 95 % identical . However , the mammalian talin2 is much less conserved with Dictyostelium talinA ( 24 % identity ) and talinB ( 25 % identity ) . Our total RNA Northern blot analysis has detected 9 . 5 and 7 . 5 kb talin2 transcripts in the brain and heart , 7 . 5 and 3 . 5 kb in the kidney , and a 4 . 4 kb in the testis ( Fig . 4 ) . In the other report using a poly ( A ) enriched mRNA blot [ 12 ] , three talin2 transcripts around 10 . 5 , 8 . 5 , and 6 . 8 kb were detected in the brain and heart , 10 . 5 , 8 . 5 , 7 . 5 , and 3 . 9 kb were identiﬁed in the kidney , and a 4 . 8 - kb transcript was expressed in the testis . In general , our results are con - sistent with theirs , although the transcript sizes were slight - ly larger in their report . This may be due to the use of diﬀerent markers . However , we neither detected the 6 . 8 kb band in the brain and heart nor the 10 . 5 , 8 . 5 kb tran - scripts in the kidney in our total RNA blot . It is possible that the amounts of these transcripts were too low to be detected in our total RNA preparation . Alternatively , the 6 . 8 - kb transcript in their study might not contain our 3 0 - UTR probe sequence . It is not clear why there are vari - ous talin2 transcripts . We found the testis splice form of talin2 that contains a unique 30 residues linked to a com - mon C - terminal portion of talin2 . This N - terminal sequence is derived from the extra 251 base pairs encoded by two additional exons ( named 25a and 25b ) between exon 25 and 26 . The new start codon is located in exon 25b , which is 2 . 6 kb downstream of 25a . The distance between exon 25 and exon 25a is 2 . 9 kb , suggesting that this 2 . 9 kb fragment might contain a testis - speciﬁc promot - er . If so , this promoter could be used in transgenic mice for speciﬁc expression in myoid and Leydig cells , and also in spermatids in older mice ( Fig . 6G ) . We have conﬁrmed that this gene - trap insertion led to the expression of a chimeric protein with the N - terminal half of the talin2 fused to the b - galactosidase by immuno - precipitation and Western blotting approaches ( Fig . 5 ) . In addition , we have detected signiﬁcantly weaker signals in mutant cell lysate samples using antibodies to talin . We ini - tially attributed the weaker talin signals in mutant cell ly - sate samples to lack of the C - terminal half of talin2 . However , the N - terminal portion of talin2 was still ex - pressed in the mutant and we would predict that an equal or even higher ( due to talin1 compensation ) amount of ta - lin would be found in the mutant samples using the anti - bodies against the N - terminus of talin . Therefore , the down - regulation of talin1 also contributed to the weaker signals . In fact , it might be the main reason for the signiﬁcant reduction of talin signals , because the amount of talin2 ( 1 – 1295 ) / b - galactosidase fusion protein was very low and was not readily detectable unless was concentrated by immunoprecipitation ( Fig . 5 ) . Why and how talin1 was down - regulated in the mutant cells is not clear . One possi - bility is that talin1 proteins form homodimers , as well as a small population of heterodimers with talin2 , and the het - erodimers may stabilize talin1 homodimers in normal cells . Talin2 ( 1 – 1295 ) / b - galactosidase fusion proteins could not form heterodimers and stabilize talin1 dimers , leading to the lower amount of total talin1 in mutant cells . Previous studies on deletion of talin1 gene in mice have demonstrated its critical role in embryonic development [ 9 ] . Many other reports have indicated that talin plays a very important role in the structure and signaling of focal adhe - sions [ 17 ] . Since talin1 and talin2 are highly conserved and most of the antibodies used for previous analyses were not able to distinguish one from the other , some of the pro - posed functions for talin might be contributed and / or shared by talin2 . For example , talin2 is shown to bind to PIP kinase 1 c [ 18 ] and actin [ 19 ] . Therefore , it somehow surprised us that no signiﬁcant abnormality was found in this talin2 mutant mouse line . Talin2 is like talin1 a large protein with 2453 amino acid residues . In this case , we would expect that lack of the C - terminal half of talin2 and in some splice forms the majority of protein ( for exam - ple , testis form ) would impair the dimerization , the second integrin binding , vinculin - binding , and actin - binding activ - ities located at the deleted C - terminus . In addition , the remaining N - terminal half might function as a dominant negative fragment . In fact , we also found down - regulation of talin1 in mutant cells . However , the mutant did not ap - pear to aﬀect embryogenesis , tissue development and func - tion , and fertility of these mice . There are several possibilities , including ( 1 ) talin1 alone is suﬃcient for ta - lin (cid:1) s function , ( 2 ) the N - terminus 1 – 1295 fragment has ac - count for all talin2 (cid:1) s function , and ( 3 ) some minor defects were not identiﬁed and / or defects in repair or regeneration process will not reveal without insult . The true answer probably will not be revealed until a completed talin2 knockout mouse is available . Acknowledgments We thank the BayGenomics for providing the gene - trapped ES clone .
