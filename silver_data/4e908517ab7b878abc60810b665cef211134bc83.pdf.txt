The endocytic pathway consists of distinct membrane compartments ; internalized molecules are delivered to early endosomes , and some of them are recycled back to the surface , whereas other molecules are sent to late endosomes and lysosomes for degrad - ation . However , little is known about how mitochondria are involved in the endocytic pathway . Here , we report that FM dyes , membrane - impermeant ﬂuorescent lipid probes , can trafﬁc to mitochondria directly from the plasma membrane by clathrin - mediated endocytosis . FM dye entry into mitochondria uses microtubule - dependent active transport , but the mechanism is differ - ent from the classical endocytic pathway . Hence , this study reveals a previously unrealized lipid trafﬁcking pathway from the plasma membrane to mitochondria . Keywords : endocytosis , mitochondria , FM dye , clathrin Introduction Endocytosis is the foundation and key cellular process by which cells internalize extracellular molecules or substances via vesicular mechanisms ( Fan et al . , 2015 ; Irannejad et al . , 2015 ) . There are many distinct routes of endocytosis , in light of the dependence on certain proteins and lipids ( Doherty and McMahon , 2009 ) . In gen - eral , internalized materials are packaged into small carrier vesicles and sent to early endosomes for sorting . Depending on the ﬁnal destination , some materials , in particular recycling receptors , are taken up into small budding vesicles and sent back to the plasma membrane for reuse , whereas others remain in early endosomes until they mature into late endosomes and ﬁnally fuse with lyso - somes for degradation . Additionally , endocytic pathways that tar - get either the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) or endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) from the plasma membrane exist ( Dolman et al . , 2005 ; Shin et al . , 2017 ) . However , less evidence suggests that mitochondria are involved in endocytic pathway . Styryl pyridinium FM dyes are amphiphilic molecules , and their positively charged pyridinium head prevents them from diffusing through the plasma membrane . FM dyes have only weak ﬂuores - cence in aqueous solution , while the ﬂuorescence increases sig - niﬁcantly in a lipid environment . They are widely used as ﬂuorescent reporters for endocytic vesicles and other compo - nents in the trafﬁcking network in animal cells ( Zhang et al . , 2007 ) , zebraﬁsh ( Vargo et al . , 2017 ) , budding yeast ( Iwaki et al . , 2004 ) , and plants ( Malinska et al . , 2014 ) . In addition , FM dyes can be used as ﬂuorescent lipid reporters to observe lipid trafﬁck - ing ( Maier et al . , 2002 ; Taraska and Almers , 2004 ) . In this study , we found that FM dyes can directly trafﬁc to mitochondria by clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Unlike the clas - sical pathway , the dye escaped from the endosome system and was directly trafﬁcked to mitochondria via microtubule - dependent active transport . Our data provide new insights into endocytosis ; some pinocytic vesicles did not fuse to form early endosomes after internalization but directly interacted with mitochondria . These results indicate that mitochondria are involved in an unknown speciﬁc endocytic pathway and extend our knowledge about the endocytic pathway . Received May 5 , 2018 .

Results FM dyes can trafﬁc to mitochondria from the plasma membrane in astrocytes Long - term incubation ( > 3 h ) with FM dyes resulted in granule - like and snake - like ﬂuorescent patterns in cultured astrocytes ( Figure 1 A middle ) . As shown in our previous report ( Zhang et al . , 2007 ) , the granule - like dots colocalized with late endosome / lysosome markers , such as Rab 7 , CD 63 , and Lamp 1 ( Supplementary Figure S 1 ) . To identify the snake - like structures that were labeled by FM dyes , we used various speciﬁc intracel - lular organelle markers , including early endosome , Golgi , and ER , but none of them colocalized with these tubules ( data not shown ) . Finally , we transfected astrocytes with EGFP - linked mitochondrial plasmids ( EGFP - Mito ) and found that almost all GFP ﬂuorescent tubules were colocalized with the FM 4 - 64 - labeled tubules ( Figure 1 A and D ) . To conﬁrm this ﬁnding , astro - cytes were loaded with Mito - Tracker deep red 633 , a mitochon - dria tracker , after loading with FM 2 - 10 . The results showed that almost all Mito - Tracker deep red 633 - labeled tubules were identical to the FM 2 - 10 - labeled tubules ( Figure 1 B and D ) . Interestingly , since the emission spectrum of FM 2 - 10 ( 500 – 750 nm ) overlaps with the excitation spectrum of Mito - Tracker deep red 633 ( 500 – 750 nm , Supplementary Figure S 2 ) , we used ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) and time - lapse imaging to analyze the relationship between the tubules labeled by FM 2 - 10 and Mito - Tracker deep red 633 . The results clearly showed that a FRET phenomenon occurred between them ( Figure 1 C and E ) , which suggests that the two ﬂuorescence molecules have sufﬁcient overlap or are within the FRET distance ( i . e . 6 – 10 nm ) ( Selvin , 2000 ; Sturmey et al . , 2006 ) . These results indicate that , with prolonged incubation , FM dyes can trafﬁc to both lysosomes and mitochondria in astrocytes . It is worth noting that FM dye labeled mitochondria in a time - dependent manner . The cultured astrocytes were incubated with FM 2 - 10 for different times , including 10 min , 20 min , 40 min , 1 h , 2 h , and 4 h . The ratio of FM 2 - 10 entry into mitochondria ( snake - like ﬂuorescence pat - terns ) at different time points was calculated and shown in Supplementary Figure S 3 . We found that the phenomenon of FM dyes entering the mitochondria can be seen as early as 10 min after incubation , but the proportion of cells entering mitochondria is very small ( Supplementary Figure S 3 A ) . Compared the granule - like dots , only a very limited snake - like ﬂuorescence pattern was observed in the short - term incubation ( < 40 min ) of FM 2 - 10 in astrocytes ( Supplementary Figure S 3 B ) . However , with prolonged incubation , the number of cells enter - ing mitochondria and the ratio of FM dyes entry into mitochon - dria increased signiﬁcantly , and it became very noticeable after a few hours ( Supplementary Figure S 3 A and B ) . And next , as to rule out the possibility that the FM dyes mediated membrane trafﬁcking to mitochondria is not an artifact of culture , we exam - ined FM dyes trafﬁcking from plasma membrane to mitochondria with freshly isolated astrocytes . The results showed that it was still unable to distinguish between mitochondria and lysosomes after adhering for 6 h ( Supplementary Figure S 4 A and B ) . After 12 h of adherence , Mito - Tracker - labeled network structures can be seen in some cells ( Supplementary Figure S 4 C ) . At this time point , incu - bation ( 2 h ) with FM 1 - 43 resulted in granule - like and snake - like ﬂuorescent patterns in freshly isolated cells , and these snake - like ﬂuorescent patterns colocalized with Mito - Tracker ( Supplementary Figure S 4 D ) . These results indicate that the phenomenon of FM dyes entering mitochondria also occurs in freshly isolated cells . The ﬁnding that mitochondria in astrocytes are involved with lipid dye endocytosis is surprising ; thus , we wanted to know whether mitochondria are involved in non - lipid endocytotic events . Here , the non - lipid dyes dextran - FITC and FITC - conjugated wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA - FITC ) were used . Prolonged incuba - tion ( > 4 h ) with these two dyes resulted in granule - like but not snake - like ﬂuorescent patterns in cultured astrocytes , which is different from the ﬂuorescent patterns of FM 4 - 64 ( Figure 2 A and B ) . The results suggest that mitochondria might speciﬁcally involve lipid endocytosis in astrocytes . To examine whether mitochondrial involvement in lipid endo - cytosis is a general phenomenon in animal cells , we used FM dyes to load ﬁbroblasts , Schwann cells , and HEK 293 cells . The results showed that FM dye - labeled mitochondrial snake - like ﬂuorescent patterns also exist in these cells ( Figure 3 ) . FM dyes are trafﬁcked to mitochondria from plasma membrane in astrocytes by clathrin - mediated endocytosis FM dyes accumulate in late endosomes / lysosomes through the classical endocytic pathway because both low temperature ( 4 ° C ) and monodansyl cadaverine ( MDC ) can block FM dye entry into late endosomes / lysosomes ( Figure 4 B and C ) . MDC is a competitive inhibitor of transglutaminase , an enzyme essential for the formation of clathrin - coated vesicles ; therefore , MDC is widely used as an inhibitor of clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Piper et al . , 2005 ; Jiang et al . , 2017 ) . However , mitochondria are not a known destination of endocytosis . The results described above prompted us to exam - ine how FM dyes are trafﬁcked to mitochondria . First , we found that both low temperature ( 4 ° C ) and MDC completely blocked FM dye entry into cells , no any ﬂuorescence signal was observed ( Figure 4 A – C and I ) . In addition , astrocytes were transfected with a dominant - negative mutant of dynamin ( HA - Dynamin - K 44 A ) , which can block clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Song et al . , 2004 ; Chou et al . , 2014 ) and also reduced FM dye entry into mitochondria ( Figure 4 H and I ) . To investigate whether lipid ﬂippase is involved in FM dye uptake , we pretreated astrocytes with N - ethylmaleimide ( NEM ) and diethylpyrocarbonate ( DEPC ) , which are cysteine and histidine modiﬁcation reagents and can inhibit ﬂippase activity ( Chang et al . , 2004 ; Benedikter et al . , 2018 ) , but neither of them reduced FM dye entry into mitochondria ( Figure 4 D , E , and I ) . Next , we tested whether FM dyes are trafﬁcked to mitochondria through nonselective ion channels as is known to occur for sensory cells ( Nishikawa and Sasaki , 1996 ; Meyers et al . , 2003 ) . Potassium ( 45 mM ) , which eliminates the driving force across the plasma membrane by depolarization , or 10 mM calcium , which displaces the divalent FM dye from the mouth of the transduction channel and decreases the open probability of the transduction channel ( Meyers et al . , 2003 ) , were added to the medium . The results showed that they also had no effect on FM dye entry into 540 j Wei et al .

Trafﬁcking pathway between plasma membrane and mitochondria j 541 mitochondria ( Figure 4 F , G , and I ) . Taken together , these results show that FM dyes are trafﬁcked to mitochondria primarily by clathrin - mediated endocytosis . FM dye entry into mitochondria is different from the classical endocytic pathway The ﬁnding that astrocyte mitochondria were labeled with FM dyes by endocytosis prompted us to examine whether FM dyes are trafﬁcked from the plasma membrane to mitochondria through the classical endocytic pathway . We ﬁrst asked whether the endocytosed FM dyes are trafﬁcked to mitochondria from the plasma membrane after interacting with the endosomal system . To test this idea , we transfected astrocytes with two GFP - linked Rab 5 mutants ( a small GTPase located in early endosomes ) that included a dominant - negative Rab 5 ( DN - Rab 5 ; Rab 5 - GFP : S 34 N ) and a constitutively active Rab 5 ( CA - Rab 5 ; Rab 5 - GFP : Q 79 L ) . It is evident from studies in mammalian cells that the intracellular trafﬁcking of endocytic ligands is speciﬁcally regulated by small GTP binding proteins of the Rab family along with their effectors ( Wandinger - Ness and Zerial , 2014 ; Pfeffer , 2017 ) .

We found that DN - Rab 5 blocked FM dye entry into early and late endosomes , whereas CA - Rab 5 led to the accumulation of FM dyes in the early endo - somes and reduced FM dye entry into the late endosomes ( Figure 5 A and B ) . However , they reduced FM dye entry into mito - chondria only slightly ( Figure 5 A , B , and G ) . We also transfected astrocytes with two GFP - linked Rab 7 mutants , DN - Rab 7 ( Rab 7 - GFP : T 22 N ) and CA - Rab 7 ( Rab 7 - GFP : Q 67 L ) , and they also had no effect on FM dye entry into mitochondria ( Figure 5 C , D , and G ) . In addition , glycyl - phenylalanine 2 - naphthylamide ( GPN ) , a cathepsin - C substrate that induces selective lysosome osmotic swelling ( Zhang et al . , 2007 ; Lu et al . , 2014 ) , did not reduce FM dye entry into mitochondria , whereas it did disrupt lysosomes ( Figure 5 E – G ) . In addition , we incubated astrocytes with FM 2 - 10 for 30 min , washed off the dye and monitored the ﬂuorescence subcellular localization and intensity of FM 2 - 10 for 4 h . As shown in Supplementary Figure S 5 and Movie S 1 , during 4 h of observation , no snake - like ﬂuorescence pattern appeared in the cell , suggesting that FM dye did not enter the mitochondria . These results indicate that the early endosome , the late endosome , and lysosomes are not involved in the process of FM dye entry into mitochondria , so this endocytic route is different from the classical endocytic pathway .

Trafﬁcking pathway between plasma membrane and mitochondria j 543 FM dyes can directly trafﬁc to mitochondria after internalization , and this process uses microtubule - dependent active transport Notably , disruption of the early / late endosomes has no effect on FM dye entry into mitochondria . The results prompted us to study how FM dyes are trafﬁcked to mitochondria after internal - ization . In the endocytic pathway , the early endosome arises by the fusion of pinocytosis , so there are two possibilities . One possibility is that some of the FM dye can escape from pinocytic vesicles after internalization and then diffuse through the cyto - sol and ﬁnally accumulate in the mitochondria . This transport is a passive process . The other possibility is that some pinocytic vesicles do not fuse with each other to form early endosomes but interact with mitochondria in some way , such as fusion or ‘kiss and run’ . This transport is an active process . To distinguish the mechanisms of FM dye entry into mitochondria , FM 2 - 10 was directly microinjected into astrocytes with a pipette . The intro - duction of FM 2 - 10 into astrocytes by microinjection produced a staining pattern that was different from the pattern the described above ( Figure 6 A ) . FM 2 - 10 spread slowly from the site of injection to result in general ﬂuorescence with no distinctive localization ( Figure 6 A ) . Despite the absence of FM 2 - 10 in the extracellular ﬂuid , the dye in the cytosol diffused persistently and gradually , but none of it was trafﬁcked to mitochondria until 30 min after microinjection ( Figure 6 A ) . Then , we used ﬂuorescence - recovery - after - photobleaching ( FRAP ) technology to examine whether newly formed pinocytic vesicles directly interacted with mitochondria . We found that the ﬂuorescence of FM 2 - 10 in the bleached mitochondrial area recovered with FM 2 - 10 added to the extracellular medium but did not recover without extracellular FM 2 - 10 ( Figure 6 B ) .

The boxed areas in A – D are shown at a higher magniﬁcation in the insets .

However , the disruption of actin by cytochalasin D ( cytoD ) had no obvious effect on reducing FM 2 - 10 entry into mito - chondria ( Figure 6 E and F ) . These results indicate that FM dyes can directly trafﬁc to mitochondria after internalization , and this process is not passive diffusion but a microtubule - dependent active transport process . Discussion In this work , we revealed a novel lipid trafﬁcking pathway that allows FM dye to directly be trafﬁcked to mitochondria from the plasma membrane , escaping the classical endocytic system . FM dyes make use of clathrin - mediated endocytosis and microtubule - dependent active transport to trafﬁc into mitochon - dria from the plasma membrane . The classical endocytic system starts with vesicle budding from the plasma membrane to form an early endosome . Some internalized molecules , in particular recycling receptors , are rap - idly recycled back to the plasma membrane for reutilization , while others , including downregulated receptors , are trans - ported to the late endosome and lysosomes for degradation . In addition to classical endocytosis , other endocytic routes have recently been reported . For example , two membrane - impermeable lipid dyes can be transferred into mitochondria through late endosome - mitochondria contact ( Chen et al . , 2018 ) . Pseudomonas exotoxin A ( PE ) , a bacterial protein , was delivered into the nuclear envelope through nuclear envelope - associated endosomes ( Chaumet et al . , 2015 ) . In addition , endosomes can interact with the Golgi apparatus ( Chaumet et al . , 2015 ; Shin et al . , 2017 ) and ER ( Dolman et al . , 2005 ) . Our work here adds mitochondria as another cargo route for the endocytic pathway . FM dyes are widely used as ﬂuorescent reporters of endocytosis and other components of the vesicle trafﬁcking network in animal cells ( Zhang et al . , 2007 ; Gu et al . , 2009 ; Bertone et al . , 2017 ) . In this paper , we found that FM dyes selectively enter lysosomes and mitochondria in animal cells after prolonged incubation . Several reports illustrated FM dye entry into sensory cells through non - selective ion channels and the labeling of ER and mitochondria ( Nishikawa and Sasaki , 1996 ; Meyers et al . , 2003 ) . However , this process is very rapid , and the time course is usually less than sev - eral minutes . In our experiments , the time course of FM dye entry into mitochondria is usually more than 2 h . The reason that a long incubation time in our experiment is required for observing FM dye trafﬁc to the mitochondria may be that the speed and quantity of FM dye transport into mitochondria are limited and can be only detected after a long period of incubation for the accumulation . Furthermore , endocytosis is blocked by cooling to 4 ° C , whereas ion permeation through channels is typically slowed only 2 - fold to 3 - fold , allowing temperature dependence to separate endocytic uptake versus permeation ( Meyers et al . , 2003 ) . In our experiments , FM dye entry into lysosomes and mitochondria was blocked at 4 ° C . Additionally , the inhibition of FM dye entry into astrocytes by an inhibitor of clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( MDC ) and the DN mutant Dynamin - K 44 A indicates that FM dyes enter both lysosomes and mitochondria by clathrin - mediated endocytosis . However , the path - ways of FM dye entry into these two cellular organelles in the cyto - sol are different . FM dyes enter lysosomes by the classical endocytic pathways ; in other words , FM dyes ﬁrst enter pinocytic vesicles , then trafﬁc into the early endosome and the late endo - some , and ultimately accumulate in lysosomes . However , FM dye entry into mitochondria is different from the classical endocytic pathways . Our results showed that after internalization , some pino - cytic vesicles can directly interact with mitochondria . And several studies have shown that microtubule - dependent activities of endo - somes depend on Rab proteins ( Nielsen et al . , 1999 ; Wandinger - Ness and Zerial , 2014 ) . But in our study , the trafﬁcking of FM dyes from the plasma membrane to mitochondria is a Rab 5 / 7 - independ - ent but microtubule - dependent active transport process . However , the mechanism and the candidate molecules that participate in FM dye entry into mitochondria remain elusive . Mitochondrial contacts with the plasma membrane have been known in Hela cells ( Frieden et al . , 2005 ) , neurons ( Perkins et al . , 2010 ) , hepatocytes ( Fowler et al . , 2013 ) , and yeast ( Lackner et al . , 2013 ) . In murine hepatocytes , the study suggests a structural subunit of gap junction , connexin 32 as an interactome for the contacts between the plasma membrane and mitochondria ( Fowler et al . , 2013 ) . In addition , another mitochondria - plasma membrane complex , the Num 1 / Mdm 36 complex was recently discovered in budding yeast ( Lackner et al . , 2013 ) . However , homologs of Num 1 or Mdm 36 are still unknown in animals ( Westermann , 2015 ) . Thus , more work is required to study the molecular characterization about the pro - cess of trafﬁcking from the plasma membrane to mitochondria . Mitochondria are not only the powerhouse in cells but they also participate in various cellular processes ( Theurey et al . , 2016 ; Braun and Westermann , 2017 ; Ho , 2017 ) . Mitochondria contain a double membrane system , including the outer membrane and the highly folded inner membrane . The precise maintenance of the lipid con - tent and molecular composition of the mitochondrial membrane is critical for proper mitochondrial function ( Murley and Nunnari , 2016 ; Klecker et al . , 2017 ) . In general , mitochondria are incapable of synthesizing most lipids . The contribution of mitochondria to cel - lular lipid biosynthesis is probably restricted to some steps that are associated with phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) , phosphatidic acid ( PA ) , and cardiolipin ( CL ) formation ( Horvath and Daum , 2013 ) . Other lipids must be imported from the ER . However , another source of importing lipids for mitochondria might exist . Reports have shown that the ﬂuorescent PE analog ( Sleight and Pagano , 1985 ) and ﬂuorescent PA analog ( Pagano et al . , 1981 ) are interna - lized and reside in the nuclear envelope , mitochondria , and Golgi apparatus in addition to the plasma membrane in cultured mam - malian cells . Experimental evidence suggests that the delivery of the ﬂuorescent PE and PA analogs to the nuclear envelope and mitochondria occur by the rapid transbilayer movement of the lipid across the plasma membrane . Additionally , some reports indicate that FM dyes can enter mitochondria in living fungal hyphae ( Fischer - Parton et al . , 2000 ) . As amphiphilic styryl dyes , FM dyes can also be used as ﬂuorescent lipid reporters to observe lipid trafﬁcking ( Maier et al . , 2002 ; Taraska and Almers , Trafﬁcking pathway between plasma membrane and mitochondria j 545 2004 ) . We show here that FM dye entry into the mitochondria may occur through a rapid transbilayer movement , which is based on the fact that two ﬂippase activity inhibitors ( NEM and DEPC ) cannot reduce FM dye entry . Hence , our study suggests a new mechanism of lipid trafﬁcking to mitochondria that is clathrin - mediated endocytosis .

In brief , the hippocampus from P 0 – P 1 Sprague Dawley rats was dissected , and the meninges were care - fully removed . They were dissociated by trypsin ( 0 . 125 % ) , plated on PDL - coated glass coverslips , grown in Eagle’s minimal essential medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( Gibco ) in a water - saturated atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 in air , and used after 6 h , 12 h , and 5 – 12 days in culture . Astrocytes were transfected with plasmid DNA at 5 or 6 days after plating using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent ( Invitrogen ) . The plasmids used in this paper include EGFP - Mito , CD 63 - GFP , Rab 5 - GFP : Q 79 L , Rab 5 - GFP : S 34 N , Rab 7 - GFP : T 22 N , Rab 7 - GFP : Q 67 L , and HA - Dynamin - K 44 A . Primary cultures of Schwann cells and ﬁbroblasts were iso - lated from 1 - to - 3 - day - old Sprague Dawley rats as described pre - viously ( Chen et al . , 2012 ) . Fluorescence imaging Astrocytes were ﬁlled using 10 μ M FM 2 - 10 , FM 1 - 43 , FM 4 - 64 , FM 5 - 95 , 50 nM Lyso - Tracker DND 99 , and 100 nM Mito - Tracker Orange ( Molecular Probes , Inc . ) in MEM with 10 % FBS for 4 h and 10 μ M 10 - kDa FITC - dextran , FITC - WGA ( Molecular Probes , Inc . ) for 12 h at 37 ° C . The astrocytes were then washed for 20 min in extracellular solution ( ECS ) before transfer to the chamber for imaging under a model IX 71 laser scanning confocal microscope ( Olympus Co . , Ltd . ) equipped with a 60 × / 1 . 2 ( plan - Apochromat ) water immersion object - ive . For FRET analysis , 2 μ M Mito - Tracker deep red 633 was added to the ECS , and the time courses of the changes in ﬂuorescence of FM 2 - 10 and Mito - Tracker were obtained at an image interval of 5 sec with a λ emission of 560 – 620 nm for FM 2 - 10 and > 650 nm for Mito - Tracker and λ excitation = 488 nm . For FRAP experiments , the astrocytes were maintained in the ECS at 35 ° C . Bleaching ( > 80 % ) was performed by applying a 488 nm laser ( 50 % of full power ; 30 mW ) for 6 . 4 ms per pixel with 30 – 50 iterations . Fluorescence recovery was monitored every 2 min during a 2 - h period . Data ana - lysis was performed with Metamorph software ( Universal Imaging Corp . ) and Fluoview 500 software ( Olympus MicroImaging , Inc . ) . Microinjection Whole - cell perforated patch recordings were used to inject FM 2 - 10 into astrocytes . The patch electrodes were made from borosilicate glass capillaries ( B - 120 - 69 - 15 , Sutter Instrument ) with resistance in the range of 4 – 7 M Ω . The pipettes were tip - ﬁlled with the internal solution and then back - ﬁlled with the internal solution containing 200 μ g / ml amphotericin B ( Sigma ) . The internal solution contained ( in mM ) : 136 . 5 K - Gluconate , 17 . 5 KCl , 9 NaCl , 1 MgCl 2 , 10 HEPES , 0 . 2 EGTA ( pH 7 . 2 ) , and 2 μ M FM 2 - 10 . The viability of astrocytes was assessed by appearance . Extensively irradiating the dye - loaded cells was found to be deleterious ; therefore , the laser dosage was mini - mized by controlling the laser power and laser dwelling time . Immunostaining Cultured astrocytes were loaded with 10 μ M AM 1 - 43 ( Molecular Probes , Inc . ) for 4 h , and then the coverslips were transferred to quencher solution ( 0 . 5 mM SCAS ) for 5 min at room temperature . Then , the astrocytes were ﬁxed with 4 % par - aformaldehyde in PBS at 4 ° C for 10 min and permeabilized with 0 . 01 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 12 min before being treated with 10 % BSA for 1 h at 25 ° C . Cultures were then stained with mouse anti - Lamp 1 ( 1 : 500 dilution ; Sigma ) or mouse anti - HA ( 1 : 500 dilution ; Sigma ) . After washing to remove excess primary antibodies , the cultures were incubated for 1 h at room tem - perature with a ﬂuorescence - conjugated secondary antibody , anti - mouse IgG - Cy 5 ( 1 : 1000 dilution ; Jackson ImmunoResearch ) . Excess antibody was removed and cells were imaged with an Olympus confocal microscope ( Olympus Fluoview 500 IX 71 ) . Statistical analyses Data are presented as mean ± SEM . Differences between groups were compared using Student’s t - test or one - way ANOVA followed by Scheffe’s post hoc test ; P < 0 . 05 was considered signiﬁcant .
