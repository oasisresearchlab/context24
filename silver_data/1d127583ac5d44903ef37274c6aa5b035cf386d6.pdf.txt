In principle , electron tomography can provide high - resolution mapping of entire proteomes . The achievable resolution ( 3 – 8 nm ) is capable of bridging the gap between live - cell imaging and atomic resolution structures . However , the relevant information is not readily accessible from the data and needs to be identified , extracted , and processed before it can be used . Because electron tomography imaging and image acquisition technologies have enjoyed major advances in the last few years and continue to increase data throughput , the need for approaches that allow automatic and objective interpretation of electron tomograms becomes more and more urgent . This chapter provides an overview of the state of the art in this field and attempts to identify the major bottlenecks that prevent approaches for interpreting electron tomography data to develop their full potential .

Introduction Electron tomography is the most widely applicable method for obtaining 3D information by electron microscopy . In fact , it is the only method suitable for investigating polymorphic structures such as organelles , cells , and tissue at high resolution ( current estimates 3 – 8 nm ) . Its principle is based on illuminat - ing the sample from many different directions , usually tilt series around one or two axes , and to reconstruct it from those projection images . While the principles of electron tomography have been known for decades , its use has gathered momentum only in recent years . It has been realized that electron tomography , especially its cryovariant , is capable of providing a complete , molecular resolution 3D mapping of entire cellular proteomes including their detailed interactions ( Leis et al . , 2009 ; Nickell et al . , 2006 ; Robinson et al . , 2007 ; Tocheva et al . , 2010 ; Volkmann and Hanein , 2009 ) . Electron tomography can depict unique structures and scenes but , due to the fact that all electron tomography preparations can only sustain a limited electron dose , the resulting reconstructions will inevitably suffer from low signal - to - noise ratios and relatively low resolution as compared to other electron microscopy techniques that can take advantage of some form of averaging . Consequently , maps obtained by electron tomography are diffi - cult to interpret . This difficulty in interpretation is further aggravated in highly complex systems ( Gru¨newald et al . , 2003 ) . Despite a recent surge in dedicated method development toward automatic interpretation of electron tomograms ( reviewed in Best et al . , 2007 ; Frangakis and Fo¨rster , 2004 ; Sandberg , 2007 ) , only relatively few algorithms for reliable detection and extraction of structural features from electron tomograms are available . Instead , the tasks of extracting and interpreting information from thehighlycomplex , 3Dscenesthatmakeupcellulartomogramsare , forthemost part , painstakingly carried out manually . Apart from the subjectivity of the process , the time - consuming ( and tiring ) nature of this manual task all but precludes the prospects of the high throughput necessary to take full advantage of the method’s potential . For example , it took over 9 months to manually segmentandinterpretroughly1 % ofthevolumeofapancreaticbetacell ( Marsh , 2005 ; Marsh et al . , 2001 ) . By combining sectioning with automatic data collec - tion schemes ( Chapter 12 , Vol . 481 ) and large - scale montaging , it is now technically possible to reconstruct entire mammalian cells with high fidelity within a reasonable timeframe ( Noske et al . , 2008 ) . Extrapolating from the time required for segmenting 1 % of a cell results in 75 man years for manually segmenting a single cell at similar detail . Conducting a meaningful study com - paring a number of cells under disease conditions with a control set would literally take hundreds of man years . The need for computational tools to efficiently aid the process and automate the structure recognition , extraction , and interpretation process as much as possible is clearly vital for making these types of studies viable . 32 Niels Volkmann The quality of cryotomographic reconstructions can be correlated with the electron dose . A total dose of 50 – 300 e (cid:1) / A˚ 2 appears to give reasonable results with a ‘‘sweet spot’’ around 120 e (cid:1) / A˚ 2 ( Iancu et al . , 2006 ) . Because this dose needs to be spread over the whole data set , the dose for each image needs to be kept low enough as to not exceed a total dose of 120 e (cid:1) / A˚ 2 . For a (cid:3) 70 (cid:4) double tilt series with a 2 (cid:4) increment , the dose available for a single image is below 1 e (cid:1) / A˚ 2 , which gives rise to extremely high noise levels in the individual images . The signal in the resulting 3D reconstructions is improved by the dose fractionation effect ( McEwen et al . , 1995 ) but the signal - to - noise ratio for these tomograms is still well below 1 . Signal - to - noise ratios in cryo - images collected for single - particle reconstructions of ribosomes have been experimentally determined to be in the 0 . 05 range ( Baxter et al . , 2009 ) . Given the fact that most contributions to the noise tend to be considerably worse in cryo - tomograms than in these relatively well behaved samples , signal - to - noise ratios in the neighborhood of 0 . 01 or less should be expected for cryo - tomograms . Together with complications from missing data and the electron microscope’s contrast transfer , this makes noise from many other image - possessing disciplines look mundane . Multiple scattering events in samples thicker than the mean free path length of the illuminating electrons dictate an upper limit of (cid:5) 1 m m in thickness for high - resolution electron tomography , even if relatively high acceleration voltage and energy filtering are used ( Grimm et al . , 1996 ) . Owing to the technically demanding nature of cryosample sectioning ( Al - Amoudi et al . , 2004 ) , ‘‘conventional’’ electron tomography , which involves staining and plastic embedding , is often preferred in practice for samples that require sectioning ( McEwen and Marko , 2001 ) . In fact , cryosectioning is currently an art form practiced in only a handful of laboratories worldwide ( see , e . g . , Al - Amoudi et al . , 2007 ; Gruska et al . , 2008 ; Hsieh et al . , 2006 ; Pierson et al . , 2010 ; Salje et al . , 2009 ) . In embedded material , the main adverse effect of electron irradiation is not direct damage to the particles ( which have been mostly exchanged for heavy metal stains anyway ) it is damage to the embedding material . For example , the beam induces serious thinning ( 25 – 50 % ) perpendicular to the beam ( Luther et al . , 1988 ) . The usual strategy around this is to preexpose the specimen to allow completion of a rapid initial thinning phase . The tilt series are then collected with low electron dose ( up to about 100 e (cid:1) / A˚ 2 per image is deemed tolerable ) to avoid beam - induced buckling of the sample or further thinning during data collection . While the signal - to - noise ratio is improved in these samples as compared to cryosamples , the resulting images and reconstructions still tend to be rather noisy . In addition , these samples can suffer additional problems such as uneven staining and other sample preparation artifacts that may complicate subsequent analysis . While there have been substantial efforts during the last few years which specifically address data from electron tomography , progress has been much Methods for Segmentation and Interpretation of Electron Tomographic Reconstructions 33 slower than in related imaging fields . As a consequence , the relative lack of adequate tools for automatic and / or objective interpretation in electron tomography has been recognized as a critical barrier to progress in the field ( Ben - Harush et al . , 2010 ; Frey et al . , 2006 ; Koning and Koster , 2009 ; Leis et al . , 2006 ; Marsh , 2005 ) . Most development efforts in biological image processing are geared toward clinical medicine : Clinical data sets typically contain organs of well - defined shape with smooth and distinct boundaries and include only a few continuous objects . In contrast , electron tomograms contain amorphous structures , ragged contours , and numerous small objects which would make it extremely challenging to interpret electron tomograms even if noise would be absent . Unlike medical data sets , for which considerable knowledge is available to validate the results and tune parameters , the interpretation of electron tomograms often leave the user uncertain about the accuracy of the analysis : it is difficult to distinguish artifacts from real structures . Other reasons why image and signal processing methods developed for other domains are not straight forward to apply to electron tomography data include : ( i ) As a consequence of the damaging effect of the electron beam which limits the amount of electrons available for image formation , electron tomograms tend to exhibit extremely high noise levels . ( ii ) The geometry of the electron tomography sample holders and the shape of the electron microscopy chamber do not allow tilting more than (cid:5) 70 (cid:4) so a good third of data space is not accessible . In accordance with the projection theorem ( Radon , 1917 ) , the nonsampled region generates a wedge - shaped segment in Fourier space that contains no information ( the ‘‘missing wedge’’ ) . This problem can be partially alleviated experimentally by taking a second data set after rotating the sample by 90 (cid:4) around the optical axis ( Mastronarde , 1997 ; Nickell et al . , 2003 ; Penczek et al . , 1995 ) , yet some of the data space is still not accessible so that some missing data artifacts will always remain . ( iii ) Aberrations of the electron microscope optics give rise to a point - spread function that can be best described in Fourier space by its Fourier transform , the contrast transfer function . This function mainly depends on the amount of defocus used for imaging and changes the amplitudes and phases of the signal . In an electron tomography setting , the contrast transfer function is not well defined within the sample , especially for thick specimens where there can be a significant variance in focus . In addition , the tilting introduces a focus gradient , further obstructing the underlying signal . ( iv ) The noise in the reconstruction results from a complex combination of different noise sources including signal - dependent shot noise due to the quantum nature of the electrons , digitization noise , and ‘‘structural noise’’ due to the support / embedding medium ( Baxter et al . , 2009 ) . In 34 Niels Volkmann addition , the noise is highly correlated in space , and is possibly cor - rupted by the contrast transfer function ( Scheres et al . , 2007 ) and the missing wedge . Thus , it is extremely hard to devise adequate noise models to take advantage of algorithms that explicitly take noise characteristics into account to improve performance . The combination of these issues makes devising automatic and objective interpretation tools extremely challenging . While the best course of action will heavily depend on the actual data and the biological question to be addressed , the general workflow for interpreting electron tomograms can be divided into a number of successive stages . Each of these stages will be described in more detail below . Most of the approaches described have been implemented in publicly available computer programs ( see Chapter 15 , Vol . 482 for a comprehensive list ) . 2 . Noise Reduction Noise reduction has proven to be an indispensable tool for visualization and preprocessing of multidimensional images in the bioimaging field in general and in electron tomography in particular . Noise reduction is espe - cially important for cryotomograms that suffer from the lowest contrast and highest noise levels . Noise - reduction schemes that were adapted for electron tomography relatively early on include wavelet transform techniques ( Stoschek and Hegerl , 1997 ) , and nonlinear anisotropic diffusion ( Frangakis and Hegerl , 2001 ) . A comparison between the two showed that nonlinear anisotropic diffusion appears to be preferable as a result of faster performance and the presence of better filtering properties ( Frangakis et al . , 2001 ) . The nonlinear anisotropic diffusion approach was later expanded by using more sophisticated local kernels that result in enhancement of curvilinear and planar structures ( Fernandez and Li , 2003 ) . In addition , the bilateral filter ( Tomasi and Manduchi , 1998 ) which is mathematically essentially equivalent to non - linear anisotropic diffusion ( Barash and Comaniciu , 2004 ) was adapted for electron tomography ( Jiang et al . , 2003 ) , achieving—not entirely surpris - ingly—similar results . Some improvements in performance over the standard bilateral filter can be achieved by explicitly accounting for impulse noise during the filtering step ( Pantelic et al . , 2006 ) . The price to pay for the improvement is the need to tune one additional adjustable parameter . In general , the noise - reduction performance of all approaches outlined above relies heavily on the choice of a set of user - specified parameters which are hard to predict for any given tomogram . In addition , these approaches can be very demanding in terms of computation time and memory requirements . These drawbacks make these algorithms cumbersome to use for nonexpert users . Approaches that are easier to use , less demanding on the computational Methods for Segmentation and Interpretation of Electron Tomographic Reconstructions 35 side and that maintain fairly reasonable performance for typical electron tomo - grams include iterative medianfiltering ( vander Heide et al . , 2007 ) and filtering based on a geometric diffusion flow called Beltrami flow ( Kimmel et al . , 2000 ) that was recently adapted for electron tomography ( Fernandez , 2009 ) . For many practical purposes such as reducing oversegmentation in automatic segmentation procedures a simple low - pass filter , despite its tendency to blur edges and features , may also be adequate ( Pintilie et al . , 2009 ) . 3 . Segmentation Interpreting an electron tomogram , even at the ultrastructural level , requires its decomposition into structural components such as membrane compartments , filamentous structures , or clusters of loosely associated macromolecules like polysomes . Various techniques have been proposed for automated or semiautomated segmentation in the field of image proces - sing . Commonly used approaches include segmentation based on region growing , edge detection , active contours , and model - based segmentation . However , none of these proved to be straight - forward in use with electron tomography data and , until recently , most segmentations of electron tomo - graphic volumes were carried out manually , using programs that allow tracing of volumes within slices to create an isocontour model of the structures of interest ( Kremer et al . , 1996 ; Li et al . , 1997 ) . This hand tracing tends to be tedious , time - consuming , and subjective ( Frey et al . , 2006 ) . Many of the computational segmentation approaches developed for elec - tron tomography attempt to improve upon manual segmentation using various types of surface fitting approaches . These range from simple spatial gradient optimization in two dimensions ( Ress et al . , 2004 ) through the use of 3D geodesic active contours ( Bartesaghi et al . , 2005 ) , to implementations of static ( fast marching method ; Bajaj et al . , 2003 ) , as well as full - fledged dynamic level - set based approaches ( Osher and Sethian , 1988 ; Whitaker and Elangovan , 2002 ) . Drawbacks for these energy - minimization based algorithms are their tendency to be subject to local optima and scalability issues resulting in the requirement of reasonably good initial surface models and careful fine - tuning and preconditioning of parameters to ensure correct convergence . An alternative to these energy - based boundary detection algorithms is the use of region - based approaches where distinct regions are detected by some characteristic ( intensity , texture ) and their boundaries naturally become the output of the segmentation . In particular , the immersion - based watershed algorithm ( Beucher and Meyer , 1993 ; Vincent and Soille , 1991 ) has been adapted specifically for use with electron tomography ( Volkmann , 2002 ) and has been used successfully for various segmentation tasks in a wide variety of tomography projects ( see , e . g . , Auer et al . , 2008 ; 36 Niels Volkmann Janssen et al . , 2006 ; Marsh et al . , 2004 ; Rouiller et al . , 2008 ; Salvi et al . , 2008 ; Schietroma et al . , 2009 ) . The algorithm is based on an analogy with a step - wise flooding of a topological relief by a fluid , with dams being built where independent flows meet . The method is in principle capable of fully automatic segmentation but , in practice , is more appropriately used in a semiautomatic fashion in order to optimize the few operating parameters . The speed of the method allows interactive refinement of these parameters ( if the volume is not too large ) and , consequently , has now been implemented in the popular graphics packages Amira ( Pruggnaller et al . , 2008 ; Stalling et al . , 2004 ) and Chimera ( Goddard et al . , 2007 ; Pintilie et al . , 2009 ) . Other segmen - tation approaches that have shown promising potential with electron tomog - raphy data are based on normalized graph cut methods and eigenvector analysis ( Frangakis and Hegerl , 2002 ) , on orientation fields and line segment detection ( Sandberg and Brega , 2007 ) , and on fuzzy sets theory ( Gardun˜o et al . , 2008 ) . In principle , there are three possible sources of information that can guide segmentation algorithms in their task : ( i ) features that define an actual boundary point ; ( ii ) features that define the inside or outside of a region ; and ( iii ) shape information of the object to be segmented . All segmentation methods described above use only one of these information sources . A general strength of energy - based approaches is their ability to incorporate shape information . This is true for weak constraints such as boundary smoothness as well as strong constraints like adherence to an absolute shape . For many of the structures in electron tomograms , while the actual shape is not generally predictable , some distinctive geometric properties are known that can be exploited . For example , the tubular shape and distinct size of microtubules can be used in conjunction with active contours to extract them from tomograms of kinetochores ( Jiang et al . , 2006 ) . Similarly , template - based iterative boundary detection together with elliptic shape models can be used to generate high fidelity segmentations of Caulobacter crescentus cell membranes ( Moussavi et al . , 2010 ) . The downside of these approaches is that the models used are highly case specific and likely need non - trivial modifications and / or adjustments for each new application . In contrast to energy - based algorithms , shape information is not easily incorporated into region - based approaches such as the watershed . While it is possible to impose weak constraints such as boundary smoothness a posterioi , the direct inclusion of more sophisticated shape models can not readily be done . A method called watersnakes ( Nguyen et al . , 2003 ) combines the watershed transform and active contours ( snakes ) into a region growing technique with an energy function , allowing it to include shape information . This approach was used to generate high fidelity segmentation of membranes ( Nguyen and Ji , 2008 ) . However , the current implementation requires a rough manual segmentation in the form of a number of manually traced slices to define the shape model . Model - only approaches have also been used with encouraging results using patch templates for different types of membranes Methods for Segmentation and Interpretation of Electron Tomographic Reconstructions 37 ( coated vs . uncoated Lebbink et al . , 2007 , 2010 ) . However , these studies were limited to stained , plastic embedded sections . In summary , there is now a fair number of segmentation approaches available that were tested with electron tomographic data . However , from a practical point of view , it is hard to predict which approach has the most promising prospects to yield the desired results . In addition , segmentation performance will likely also depend on which noise - reduction approach was used , making predictions even less certain . 4 . Detection and Mapping of Macromolecular Assemblies While features like membranes , vesicles and , to some extent , fila - ments , can be detected , identified , and extracted with above - mentioned segmentation algorithms , macromolecular assemblies need to be addressed in a more direct fashion . One way is through explicit labeling of molecules of interest but this will only give access to a subset of assemblies . The more general and more attractive way of detection is through computational methods sometimes dubbed ‘‘visual proteomics’’ ( Nickell et al . , 2006 ) . The first feasibility test for detecting macromolecules in tomographic reconstructions using an algorithmic approach was done using correlation - based template matching on tomograms systems of purified thermosomes , 20S proteasomes , and GroEL , respectively ( Bo¨hm et al . , 2000 ) . The results were quite encouraging with very high detection fidelity but the conditions of the specimen were far removed from the situation in cellular tomograms : cells are highly crowded with many different constituents and interacting partners . Follow - up tests were done with ‘‘phantom cells’’ ( liposomes ) filled with 20S proteasomes , thermosomes , or both ( Frangakis et al . , 2002 ) . In this environment , results are less convincing , but still encouraging . However , this constitutes still a best case scenario where crowding is absent and the templates are not only essentially perfect but also fairly dissimilar . This type of template matching consists of using a ‘‘matched filter’’ which can be shown to be a Bayesian classifier ( minimizing the probability of identification errors ) , as long as the template and the target are nearly identical and the noise is independent and identically distributed , Gaussian , and additive ( Sigworth , 2004 ; van Trees , 1968 ) . These conditions are not very well met for electron tomographic reconstructions : the noise is spatially correlated by the reconstruction process and the point - spread function ; the tails of the noise distribution are often quite heavy , especially in stained samples ( van der Heide et al . , 2007 ) , making the noise distribution distinctly non - Gaussian ; and the uncertainty in the magnification , the potential mix of conformations , and / or the presence of stain make it difficult to obtain 38 Niels Volkmann sufficiently accurate templates . As a consequence , false hits tend to be generated by this method in areas of high density such as membranes or dense vesicles when used with cellular tomograms ( Ortiz et al . , 2006 ; Rath et al . , 2003 ) . Sensitivity of the detection performance to the template definition has also been observed ( Rath et al . , 2003 ) . In summary , feasibility tests with simplified systems indicate that mac - romolecular assemblies in the size range of 0 . 5 – 1 MDa can be identified with satisfactory fidelity using correlation - based template matching in elec - tron cryotomograms . However , these tests were done in the absence of molecular crowding and with essentially perfect templates . Applications to actual cellular tomograms indicate that there is still room for improvement , possibly through combination with other , alternative algorithms that are more robust to the noise features and to inaccuracies in the templates . 5 . Classification and Averaging It has been realized that the quality and resolution of the raw densities of macromolecular assemblies extracted from electron tomograms are gen - erally not good enough for direct structural interpretation or meaningful docking of atomic models . In order to boost the signal to make this feasible , the motifs must be aligned , classified , and averaged . The quality of the average depends critically on the accuracy of the 3D alignment . This alignment is not only hampered by the low signal - to - noise ratio in the tomograms but also by the missing data caused by the experimental setup . In addition , variations between the motifs ( e . g . , different conformations ) may exist and must be sorted out before averaging to avoid blurring of details . These obstacles make the task of averaging motifs extracted from electron tomograms difficult . Several approaches have been developed recently that attempt to address these issues ( Bartesaghi et al . , 2008 ; Fo¨rster et al . , 2007 ; Schmid and Booth , 2008 ; Winkler et al . , 2009 ) . An alternative and fairly general way of dealing with the missing data issue is by using weighting functions and Fourier space representations of the correlation coefficient which is then used as a scoring function for classifica - tion and alignment . The Pearson correlation coefficient can be expressed without loss of generality in Fourier space ( Volkmann et al . , 1995 ) . The missing data , which is expressed as an empty wedge or pyramid can easily accounted for during score calculation . We use the following mechanism for achieving this . The score is calculated according to the following formula : C ¼ P hkl w 1 F 1 (cid:6) w 2 F 2 (cid:6) cos f 1 (cid:1) f 2 ð Þ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃP hkl w 1 F 1 ð Þ 2 (cid:6) P hkl w 2 F 2 ð Þ 2 q ; ð 2 : 1 Þ Methods for Segmentation and Interpretation of Electron Tomographic Reconstructions 39 where F 1 and F 2 are the amplitudes of the Fourier coefficients of the two densities , f i are the phases and w i are weights . The sum is over all Fourier coefficients up to the resolution of the study . If all w i ¼ 1 , this expression is exactly equivalent to the Pearson correlation coefficient in real space ( Lunin and Woolfson , 1993 ) . The weights can be exploited to account for the missing data . They can be set to 0 ifa Fouriercoefficient falls into themissing wedge and to 1 if it does not . Proper normalization is automatically taken care of . An additional advantage of this formulation is that arbitrary weights can be intro - duced without loss of generality . This will allow , for example , the use of fuzzy borders rather than sharp wedges , accounting for the uncertainty of the tilt angle determination or to weigh the Fourier terms in the average according to the number of contributing volumes . Application of a prototype version of this wedge - weighted correlation scheme has already proven useful in the determi - nation of the Arp 2 / 3 branch junction structure , where it led to a resolution improvement from 32 to 26 A˚ ( Rouiller et al . , 2008 ) . Another advantage of this scheme is that it can be equally well applied to account for missing data during correlation - based fitting of high - resolution structures into the averaged sub - volumes ( Volkmann , 2009 ; Volkmann and Hanein , 1999 , 2003 ) . Classification or sorting of different conformations is an important step for improving the quality of the averages . This can be accomplished by pair - wise scoring and hierarchical ascendant cluster analysis ( Fo¨rster et al . , 2007 ; Schmid and Booth , 2008 ) or alignment - through - classification techniques ( Bartesaghi et al . , 2008 ; Winkler et al . , 2009 ) , both of which have their strength and weaknesses . An alternative approach for sorting conformations is based on a locally focused classification procedure that uses the density distribution within selected variance peaks of the current average as a sorting criterion . This strategy enabled the separation of two distinctly different populations in the Bovine and Yeast Arp 2 / 3 mediated branch junction samples that were correlated with the orientation on the sample holder ( Rouiller et al . , 2008 ) . Focused variance analysis was also used successfully in two dimensions for sorting two alternative positions of Arp2 - attached GFP in actin branches ( Egile et al . , 2005 ) . Through approximating the variance via bootstrapping ( Penczek et al . , 2006b ) , the same idea can be applied to single - particle reconstructions ( Penczek et al . , 2006a ) . 6 . Validation Some of the major questions and reoccurring themes in the interpre - tation of electron tomograms are : Is this the best that can be done ? Does the procedure used destroy information ? Does it emphasize artifacts and leads to overinterpretation ? Currently , there is no obvious answer to these ques - tions . Other than the calculations for the template matching in the clean 40 Niels Volkmann macromolecular and liposome systems , all evaluations are ultimately depen - dent on subjective human judgment . The associated difficulties are exem - plified by the large discrepancies encountered by different human operators even for the relatively simple task of delineating membranes in relatively high contrast tomograms ( Gardun˜o et al . , 2008 ; Nguyen and Ji , 2008 ) . Furthermore , 3D scenes at the resolution of these tomograms are generally completely unfamiliar to the human eye and even in the absence of noise would likely appear rather chaotic due to the high degree of crowding in cells ( Gru¨newald et al . , 2003 ) . As a consequence , the value of ‘‘ground truth’’ determination by human evaluation in this context is of questionable value . Humans are subject to all sorts of biases when evaluating visual clues ( see , e . g . , Harley et al . , 2004 ; Maloney et al . , 2005 ; Zhaoping and Jingling , 2008 ) . While we could hope to average out individual subjectivity in scene evaluation tasks by averaging over many individuals , these species - depen - dent biases are not likely to be remedied by averaging . The lack of adequate ‘‘ground truths’’ data dictates that the well - devel - oped theories of signal detection ( Green and Swets , 1989 ) and receiver operator characteristics ( Hanley and McNeil , 1982 ) used in the medical imaging field are not readily applicable to the field of molecular resolution electron tomography . In medical imaging , the correctness of scene evalua - tion ( diagnosis ) can be readily evaluated ( patient did / did not have cancer ) . In summary , the perhaps most severe bottleneck for successful interpreta - tion of molecular resolution electron tomograms is not necessarily the lack of tools ; it is the lack of ability to evaluate the performance of available tools . Owing to general human biases and the alien nature of the molecular resolution scenes encountered in cellular environments , provision of hand - annotated data sets to establish ‘‘ground truth’’ for evaluation of algorithms is not likely to provide a satisfactory solution . Thus , the most viable path to remedy this situation may be the generation of realistic simulated data sets . However , this would not only require assembling realistic molecular scenes from atomic level structures , it would also require a push in developing appropriate imaging and noise models . Both are clearly difficult and chal - lenging tasks . On the bright side , an added benefit of accurate noise models would be their potential usefulness in various image processing approaches that make explicit use of noise modeling such as maximum likelihood methods ( Scheres et al . , 2009 , see also Chapter 10 , Vol . 482 ) .
