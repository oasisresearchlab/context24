The scanning probe shape was modified using polystyrene beads for a defined surface area nondestructively deforming the sample . An extended Hertz model is introduced to measure the frequency - dependent storage and loss moduli even for thin cell samples . Control measurements of the polyacrylamide gels compare well with conventional rheological data . The cells show a viscoelastic signature similar to in vitro actin gels . PACS numbers : 87 . 15 . La The internal structure and organization of eukaryotic cells depend on the cytoskeleton , a polymer network of various protein filaments within the cell interior ( actin fila - ments , intermediate filaments , microtubules ) . The size and the inhomogeneous nature of the cell structure exclude conventional bulk rheology , and make it an ideal subject for investigations of locally varying mechanical proper - ties . Understanding the strongly nonlinear deformation response of cells , with the ability to withstand stresses of over 10 kPa and yet deform readily to the slight pressures when adhering to their neighbors , requires the ability to probe a variety of stress ranges . In contrast to previous atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) elasticity measurements [ 1 , 2 ] , which were more qualitative in nature , we have developed a technique to perform frequency - dependent microrheology with submicron spatial resolution , a large frequency range ( 20 – 400 Hz ) , and a controlled non - destructive stress range ( 100 Pa – 10 kPa ) . Our success with measuring the viscoelastic properties of cells exem - plifies our ability to characterize thin , anisotropic samples where local measurements are key . Thus , we expect that measurements like these will provide insight into the viscoelastic properties of soft , inhomogeneous layers adsorbed on rigid substrates such as block - copolymer films and lithographic polymer coatings . Establishing the local viscoelastic properties within a cell is vital to the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of cell motion and of cytoskeletal changes in response to alterations in cell function [ 3 ] . Current local methods to investigate cells include cell poking [ 4 ] , a novel laser tracking method [ 5 ] , and microrheology based on embedded or attached magnetic beads [ 6 ] , which is effective in the low stress regime (cid:1) , 500 Pa (cid:2) but has possible complications of the beads disturbing the network structure . Additionally , atomic force microscopy as a nanoindentation technique as yet provides no quantitative frequency - dependent information [ 7 ] . The scanning probe technique , i . e . , AFM , has advan - tages such as an easy adjustment to the liquid environ - ment , the possibility of local measurements , repeatability , and precise force determinations . The stress on the sample depends on the exact contact area with the sample , which is a function of the shape of the indenting tip . The Hertz model , commonly used to determine the zero - frequency Young’s modulus from AFM data , assumes a spherical tip [ 8 ] , although a sharp pyramid shape is more accurate . Comparative studies provide suitable data without focus - ing on the absolute elastic values that depend on accurate tip shape descriptions [ 9 ] . A modified Hertz model with a conical tip shape approximation has been the most ef - fective for obtaining absolute elasticity values for different cell lines [ 1 , 10 ] . However , with the relatively large inden - tations produced by the high stresses of the sharp tips , mea - surable contributions from the hard substrate are quickly observable for the cell’s finite sample depths [ 11 ] . Most importantly , in previous AFM experiments , the cell’s vis - cous properties have been observed only qualitatively from phase differences between an oscillating sample and the re - sponding tip [ 1 , 2 ] . For a quantitative assessment of the viscoelastic prop - erties , a defined probe geometry is necessary to control stresses and to provide a contact area which is easy to model . The modified geometry done by attaching a polystyrene sphere to the end of the AFM tip produces a spherical indentation in contact with the sample [ 12 ] . Though minor , this modification is key to the ability to probe viscoelastic properties of thin samples quantitatively using the modified Hertz model described in this Letter . It also provides the opportunity to modify the stress range (cid:1)(cid:3) 100 Pa 10 kPa (cid:2) by modifying the contact area (cid:1) 0 . 5 30 m m 2 (cid:2) by changing the bead diameter from as high as 12 m m to less than 1 m m . Additionally , due to the controlled stresses and , thus , lower indentations for per - ceivable force measurements , the undesirable contribution 880 0031 - 9007 (cid:4) 00 (cid:4) 85 ( 4 ) (cid:4) 880 ( 4 ) $ 15 . 00 © 2000 The American Physical Society V OLUME 85 , N UMBER 4 P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 24 J ULY 2000 of the underlying hard substrate is avoided and the thinner samples can be probed . The lower stress range is ideal for fragile materials , and we noted a significantly lowered probability of scraping cells from the substrate and no instances of cell damage by slicing the cell membrane . For quantitative measurements , the exact diameter of each new probe and its precise position with respect to the cantilever tip were measured prior to use by reverse imaging on a Park Scientific Instrument AFM using a conventional sharp tip [ see Fig . 1 ( a ) ] . Before addressing viscoelastic properties , we determine the accuracy of our new geometry in the spherical Hertz model . A cross - linked 4 % polyacrylamide gel ( 300 m m thick , 30 (cid:4) 0 . 8 acrylamide (cid:4) bisacrylamide by weight and where bisacrylamide is the cross - linker ) provided the test sample . The cross - linking provides an elastic response . Substrate effects observed in thinner samples can be ruled out because the film is relatively thick (cid:1) . 200 m m (cid:2) [ 11 ] . The Hertz model predicts a constant value for F (cid:4) p R d 3 ( R : radius of the bead ; F : applied force ; d : indentation ) as a function of the relative indentation d (cid:4) R in analogy with the spring constant of Hooke’s law in one dimension [ 8 ] . This constant is expressed in terms of the Young’s modulus (cid:1) E (cid:2) and the Poisson ratio (cid:1) n (cid:2) , which quantifies the relation between shear and compression stretching modes . Plotting 34 F (cid:4) p R d 3 (cid:1) E (cid:4)(cid:1) 1 2 n 2 (cid:2) as a function of d (cid:4) R and examining the data for a constant value provides the Hertz model’s range of reliability as shown in Fig . 1 ( b ) . The data points close to the surface strongly reflect uncertainties in the position of contact accounting FIG . 1 . ( a ) Topographic image of the probe shape generated by the polystyrene sphere glued to the cantilever . ( b ) The constant E (cid:4)(cid:1) 1 2 n 2 (cid:2) , which from the Hertz model is F (cid:4) p R d 3 , is plotted for a polyacrylamide film and two NIH3T3 fibroblasts . The AFM error mode images of the two cells are shown as insets with the measurement positions marked . The gray scale represents changes in height . for the initial variance . Deviations as d (cid:4) R approaches 1 are expected due to limitations of the spherical Hertz model which is accurate only at low indentation depths (cid:1) d , R (cid:2) , although the model is accurate for a paraboloid at arbitrary indentation depths [ 13 ] . The small magnitude (cid:1) , 10 % (cid:2) of the deviation at the higher depths indicates that the indentation shape closely resembles a parabo - loid . Thus , Fig . 1 ( b ) shows a clear constant with the exception of points very close to the contact point ( within 100 nm ) and , to a lesser extent , points very deep in the sample (cid:1) . 0 . 2 R (cid:2) . This AFM data led to a Young’s modulus of 2160 6 640 Pa for the polyacrylamide gel , derived from a Hertz model fit to the data with an assumed 0 . 33 Poisson ratio , as found by Geissler et al . [ 14 , 15 ] . This compares well to results from a commercial rheometer , Rheometrics 8400 , of 2100 6 100 Pa at similar frequencies . The complex shear modulus G (cid:1) was measured under an oscillating strain using rotating parallel plates . The shear modulus contains a real ( elastic ) part , the storage modulus G 0 , that is in phase with the applied signal and an imaginary ( viscous ) part , the loss modulus G 00 , that is 90 ± out of phase . G is related to the Young’s modulus by E (cid:1) 2 (cid:1) 1 1 n (cid:2) G for a continu - ous medium . In addition to the thicker polymer gel data , we studied the Hertz model for NIH3T3 fibroblasts as a typical example of eukaryotic cells . For the two positions on the cells displayed in Fig . 1 ( b ) the zero - frequency limit of E (cid:1) E (cid:4)(cid:1) 1 2 n 2 (cid:2) was calculated to 1 . 90 6 0 . 15 kPa (cid:1) A (cid:2) and 1 . 01 6 0 . 08 kPa (cid:1) B (cid:2) using the conventional Hertz model . For the sake of comparison with the later frequency - dependent data , no assumption on the value of n was made [ 16 ] . The extended range that the Hertz model applies to is remarkable despite the fact that cells are only 2 – 4 microns thick and very soft . No significant deviations from a constant were observed for indentations of up to 25 % of the total depth . To measure the viscoelastic properties of cells , a small amplitude ( 5 – 20 nm ) sinusoidal signal modulated the driving signal perpendicular to the sample surface about an initial ( dc ) indentation point d 0 . The small modulation originated from a lock - in and was fed to the scanner through a custom low frequency addition module . The signal response to the cantilever ( force constant k (cid:1) 0 . 02 0 . 05 calibrated to within 10 % ) was returned to the lock - in for comparison . Both the phase and amplitude differences between the applied modulation and the cantilever response signal were recorded . The spherical Hertz model is applicable only for dc mea - surements . We have extended this to permit viscoelastic measurements , by an expansion in the indentation depth d . For small amplitude oscillations e d relative to the av - erage ( dc ) indentation depth d 0 a two - term expansion is sufficient . f bead (cid:5) 43 p R (cid:1) E 0 d 3 (cid:4) 2 1 32 E (cid:1) p d 0 e d (cid:2) . ( 1 ) 881 V OLUME 85 , N UMBER 4 P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 24 J ULY 2000 In analogy to the complex shear modulus (cid:1) G (cid:1) (cid:2) from con - ventional rheometry , we defined the frequency - dependent part of the constant ratio E (cid:4)(cid:1) 1 2 n 2 (cid:2) (cid:1) 2 (cid:1) 1 1 n (cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:1) 1 2 n 2 (cid:2) G (cid:1) as E (cid:1) , and E 0 refers to the zero frequency value of 2 (cid:1) 1 1 n (cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:1) 1 2 n 2 (cid:2) G 0 . The first term of Eq . ( 1 ) is the spherical Hertz model appropriate for dc measurements , and the second term is the frequency - dependent term of the force f osc . Experimentally , the probe deforms the sample to a point d 0 with a small additional oscillating signal and the cantilever responds with a phase - shifted signal . Changes in d 0 were made extremely slowly in comparison to the frequency of e d , so d 0 is essentially time indepen - dent . The difference between the oscillating signal driving the sample and the resulting signal of the cantilever e d has both a real ( in - phase ) and an imaginary ( 90 ± out - of - phase ) component , which are related to the real and imaginary parts of f osc . If no other forces existed in this system , then Eq . ( 1 ) and the AFM data would be sufficient to determine the value of E (cid:1) with its real ( storage ) E 0 and imaginary ( loss ) E 00 components . However , the hydrodynamic impact on the cantilever as it oscillates in the surrounding media affects the total measured response . We expect the drag force f drag to be proportional to the frequency of oscillation v , the ampli - tude of the indentation oscillation e d , the size of the can - tilever , and the viscosity of the media , grouped into the constant a . f drag (cid:1) i va e d ( 2 ) Measuring the cantilever response to oscillations in the sample while the cantilever was barely above the surface provided a . The value of f drag could then be determined for any indentation of the sample with variable e d . There will be no drag on the zero - frequency response so f drag contributes solely to the value of f osc . The measured frequency - dependent cantilever response f total is the sum of f osc and f drag . Thus , f osc can be extracted . The second term of Eq . ( 1 ) can then be rearranged to provide the stor - age and loss components of E (cid:1) (cid:1) E 0 1 iE 00 with complex values for f osc and e d . E (cid:1) (cid:1) 1 2 f osc e d p d 0 R . ( 3 ) Again the 4 % polyacrylamide film serves as a simple standard for the model . Figure 2 ( a ) depicts f osc (cid:4) e d shows as a function of the square root of d 0 . The square root de - pendence on d 0 , expected from Eq . ( 3 ) , is clearly evident in the real part . As this model is only a two - term expan - sion in d , its accuracy is not maintained for very low d 0 where the oscillation amplitude is comparable to d 0 . This effect is most evident in the imaginary part of f osc evi - dent as an initial apparent dip . This artifact , broadened by the time resolution of the lock - in amplifier , obscures the square root dependence of the imaginary part of f osc until deeper indentations . FIG . 2 . ( a ) Shown here is the polyacrylamide data at 50 Hz of both the in - phase ( real ) and 90 ± out - of - phase ( imaginary ) components of f osc (cid:4) e d . The large initial imaginary component is a surface artifact broadened by the resolution of the lock - in . ( b ) Frequency scan of E 0 and E 00 for a polyacrylamide film with error bars reflecting uncertainties due to the contact point and the calibration of the cantilever force constant . For values of f osc when d 0 ¿ e d , the values of E 0 and E 00 can be determined with Eq . ( 3 ) . To illustrate the frequency dependence of E (cid:1) , E 0 and E 00 were plotted on a log scale in Fig . 2 ( b ) with respect to frequency . As was clear in the previous figure , E 00 is very small in the range where d 0 ¿ e d . An elastic , rubberlike plateau (cid:1) E 0 (cid:5) const ; E 00 ø E 0 (cid:2) is clearly visible in this frequency range as expected for a cross - linked gel . The plateau modulus of E 0 is approximately 2 . 3 6 0 . 2 kPa . The error bars on the graph reflect the uncertainties due to cantilever force constant calibrations and the contact point [ 17 ] . NIH3T3 fibroblasts demonstrate the versatility of our AFM - based microrheology for complex biological mate - rials with viscous areas as well as elastic areas varying on a scale of microns . The real and imaginary parts of the viscoelastic constant E (cid:1) taken at 50 Hz are plotted in Fig . 3 ( a ) as a function of the total indentation depth d 0 . Though the polyacrylamide data were obtained with the smallest radius probe , the linearity of the data extends well into the sample beyond the linearity of the cell data . The cells display a nonlinear increase in the elasticity for high indentation depths , although the indentation is still not a significant percentage of the probe radius . This non - linearity does not necessarily imply that the cell itself is nonlinear over this low stress range . Unlike the relatively thick polyacrylamide sample , the cells are much thinner ( 2 – 4 microns ) , and thus the effect of the substrate is mea - surable earlier than deviations from the Hertz model due to indentations on the order of R . For oscillation amplitudes near d 0 , all curves show a deviation in analogy to the re - sults of Fig . 2 ( b ) . The constant regime begins beyond the 882 V OLUME 85 , N UMBER 4 P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 24 J ULY 2000 initial surface artifact and extends 200 – 500 nm into the cell , about 10 % of the overall depth of the sample as ex - pected for thin samples [ 18 ] . In this range , the slope of E 0 and E 00 is practically zero with the plateau continuing for hundreds of nanometers ( 80 data points ) . An average over this region provides the viscoelastic constants of interest , and unlike the polyacrylamide data , the cells show a sig - nificant viscous contribution . Data from two typical NIH3T3 fibroblasts are shown in Fig . 3 ( b ) and the real and imaginary parts are very close . Furthermore , the cells show a significant frequency depen - dence of the viscoelastic constant , which nearly doubles over frequencies ranging from 50 – 300 Hz . E 0 ranges from close to the zero - frequency results at 2 . 1 6 0 . 2 kPa and 1 . 2 6 0 . 1 kPa to 3 . 1 6 0 . 3 kPa and 2 . 0 6 0 . 2 kPa for cells A and B , respectively , and E 00 varies similarly . The fibroblasts’ viscoelastic behavior strongly resembles the transition from the elastic rubberlike plateau to the in - ternal dynamics regime found in this frequency range for actin gels [ 19 ] , indicating that the response is dominated by the actin cytoskeleton of the cells . The viscoelastic behavior of polymer solutions and gels is directly related to the motions of individual chains in the polymer network . Thus , rheological measurements not only provide viscoelastic constants , but also give detailed information about polymer dynamics . Our AFM - based FIG . 3 . ( a ) E 0 and E 00 taken at 50 Hz are plotted for the two positions on the NIH3T3 cells pictured in Fig . 1 ( b ) and a poly - acrylamide gel as a function of total indentation depth .

Quanti - fying the data required us to address previous problems due to the complex , highly nonlinear deformation by standard AFM tips , hydrodynamic contributions of the cantilever , and deviations of the Hertz model in finite thickness samples . As with conventional rheology , our new technique can have a major impact on the under - standing of polymeric properties , especially of complex systems such as inhomogeneous thin films , which are of increasing interest to soft condensed matter physics .
