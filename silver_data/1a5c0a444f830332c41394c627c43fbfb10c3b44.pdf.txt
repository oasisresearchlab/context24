It was previously thought that this remarkable analgesia is ensured by direct nerve cell destruc - tion . We demonstrate here that M . ulcerans - induced hypoesthesia is instead achieved through a speciﬁc neurological pathway triggered by the secreted mycobacterial polyketide mycolactone . We decipher this pathway at the molecular level , showing that mycolactone elicits signaling through type 2 angiotensin II receptors ( AT 2 Rs ) , leading to potassium - dependent hyperpolarization of neurons . We further validate the physiological relevance of this mechanism with in vivo studies of pain sensi - tivity in mice infected with M . ulcerans , following the disruption of the identiﬁed pathway . Our ﬁnd - ings shed new light on molecular mechanisms evolved by natural systems for the induction of very effective analgesia , opening up the prospect of new families of analgesics derived from such systems . INTRODUCTION Mycobacterium ulcerans is the causative agent of Buruli ulcer . The incidence of BU is increasing worldwide , ranking third among mycobacterial diseases ( Sizaire et al . , 2006 ; Wans - brough - Jones and Phillips , 2006 ) . In most cases , M . ulcerans infection is associated with a subcutaneous nodule that is typi - cally painless ( Asiedu et al . , 2000 ; Johnson et al . , 2005 ) . If un - treated , the disease progresses to necrotic lesions and open wounds , for which , ultimately , the only solution is heavy surgical intervention . The absence of pain in the lesions , in the early infec - tion stages , often results in delayed care seeking . Elucidation of the precise mechanisms of hypoesthesia in Buruli ulcer is of great importance , not only for prophylactic purposes but also to improve our fundamental understanding of the modes of ac - tion of natural analgesics . It was thought until now that analgesia in Buruli ulcer is achieved by direct destruction of nerve bundles , in particular through the action of mycolactone ( En et al . , 2008 ; Goto et al . , 2006 ) , a polyketide toxin secreted by M . ulcerans which is essential for bacterial virulence , immune modulation , and host colonization ( Coutanceau et al . , 2005 ; George et al . , 1999 ; Gue - nin - Mace´ et al . , 2011 ; Marsollier et al . , 2005 ; Marsollier et al . , 2007 ; Simmonds et al . , 2009 ; Torrado et al . , 2010 ) . However , several pieces of evidence contradict the hypothesis attributing hypoesthesia induced by M . ulcerans to nerve degeneration . As Cell 157 , 1565 – 1576 , June 19 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 1565 a matter of fact , nerve damage is observed only in the late stages of infection , whereas painlessness usually occurs in the early stages ( En et al . , 2008 ; Goto et al . , 2006 ) . Here , we seek to eluci - date the mechanisms underlying the very effective induction of analgesia in Buruli ulcer . We ﬁrst reassess in detail the hypothesis of nerve degeneration using a mouse model of M . ulcerans infection . We show in this model that the induction of analgesia by mycolactone is not accompanied by nerve degeneration . Rather mycolactone induces cell hyperpolar - ization , which we show is triggered by the angiotensin II receptor ( AT 2 R ) . We further dissect the underlying pathway showing that mycolactone signaling involves cyclooxygenase 1 ( COX - 1 ) and prostaglandin E2 , resulting in the activation of TRAAK potassium channels . Foremost , we validate in vivo the relevance of this signaling pathway in the mycolactone - mediated hypoesthesia induced by M . ulcerans , showing that blockade of AT 2 R restores sensitivity to pain in mice . RESULTS M . ulcerans Induces Hypoesthesia in Early Stages of Edema We developed a mouse model to assess the relationship be - tween hypoesthesia and nerve degeneration under low dose conditions of M . ulcerans infection . M . ulcerans was injected into the footpads of mice , and hypoesthesia was monitored with the pain receptive tail - ﬂick assay at different time points . Under such conditions , mice exhibited redness at day 35 postin - fection and edema at day 45 . At both time points , hypoesthesia was observed in M . ulcerans - infected animals , with a signiﬁcant tail - ﬂick latency of 4 s , as compared to noninfected controls ( Fig - ure 1A ) . Histological analysis of mice inoculated with M . ulcerans expressing GFP showed the presence of bacilli around the inoc - ulation site , both in the stages of redness and edema ( Figure 1B ) . On the other hand , no GFP bacilli were found in nervous tissue , either in glial cells or in axons . Macroscopic and ultrastructural inspection revealed no signs of nerve degeneration ( Figures 1C and 1D ) . Similarly , extensive examination of more than 480 Re - mak ﬁbers showed no differences between M . ulcerans - infected footpads and noninfected controls at the level of cytoskeletal cell composition , organization of microtubules and ﬁlaments , struc - ture of unmyelinated axons , or size of Schwann cell nuclei ( Fig - ures 1C and 1D ) . Finally , no obvious anomalies were observed in the infected footpads at the level of myelinated or C - ﬁbers involved in sensory information transmission ( Besson , 1999 ; Grifﬁn and Thompson , 2008 ) . Taken together , these results demonstrate that hypoesthesia in M . ulcerans infection is not attributable to nerve degeneration , at least in this mouse model . We next investigated the effect of direct inoculation of puriﬁed mycolactone on hypoesthesia and nerve damage . Used as control , lidocaı¨ne induced a transient hypoesthesia in our model shortly after injection . Low doses of mycolactone produced sustained analgesia for up to 2 days ( Figure 1E ) . Noticeably , nociceptive abilities were recovered after 8 days . Under these conditions , as for M . ulcerans - infected samples , we performed a close inspection of Remak ﬁbers observing again that the Schwann cells were intact ( Besson , 1999 ; Hoeijmakers et al . , 2012 ) . Thus , mycolactone injection alone is sufﬁcient to produce hypoesthesia without nerve damage . Further , we also tested chemically synthesized mycolactone , to rule out possible effects of contaminants in our preparation of puriﬁed mycolactone . The synthetic mycolactone induced the same level of reversible hypoesthesia as the puriﬁed toxin , with the same concentrations and application durations . This result clearly demonstrates that the observed analgesic effect is attributable to the mycolactone toxin ( Figure 1E ) . Mycolactone Induces Hyperpolarization of Neurons With this hypothesis of nerve degeneration to account for hypo - esthesia ruled out , it was natural to ask whether mycolactone could instead produce hypoesthesia by interfering with relevant neural transmission pathways . To this end , we examined the effect of mycolactone on membrane potential in neurons derived from PC12 cells using the patch - clamp technique in the current - clamp mode . Upon local and continuous application , mycolac - tone induced a slowly developing cell hyperpolarization . As compared to vehicle - treated neurons , an average decrease of (cid:1) 10 mV in the membrane potential was observed after 20 min of incubation with puriﬁed mycolactone at subtoxic doses ( Fig - ures 2A , 2B , and Figure S1 available online ) . The same mem - brane potential change was also observed with the synthetic mycolactone , at the same concentration . After removal of the toxin , the cells recovered their resting membrane potential , dis - playing signal intensities similar to those before addition of toxin . As a matter of fact , such reversibility of the effect of mycolactone also supports the conclusion relative to the absence of neuronal damage ( Figure 2C ) . For enhanced characterization , we next developed an image - based phenotypic assay based on the monitoring of mycolactone - induced hyperpolarization . More speciﬁcally , neurons were loaded with the voltage - sensitive ﬂuo - rescent bis - oxonol probe DiSBAC 2 ( 3 ) ( Dall’Asta et al . , 1997 ) and exposed to mycolactone . In this assay , the cell ﬂuorescence decreased within 20 min ( Figure 2C ) , with the cells exhibiting the same type of slowly developed hyperpolarization as that observed by electrophysiological recordings of membrane po - tentials . Accordingly we decided to monitor the effect of toxin at 20 min in the following experiments . For image - based quanti - ﬁcation of the samples , the DiSBAC 2 ( 3 ) signal was recorded before addition of toxin and 20 min after ( [ T1int ] and [ T2int ] , respectively ) , and the intensity ratio [ T2int / T1int ] was calculated ( Figures S2A and S2B ) . Such quantiﬁcation of the samples showed that 40 % of the signal intensity was lost in the presence of 0 . 175 ng / ml mycolactone ( Figure 2D ) . Hyperpolarization is typically associated with K + channels , and we checked that such channels were involved in the mycolactone - induced hyper - polarization . To this end we treated cells with the two K + channel blockers tetraethylammonium ( TEA ) and barium chloride ( BaCl 2 ) . As shown in Figures 2E and 2F , TEA and BaCl 2 abolished the my - colactone - mediated hyperpolarization demonstrating that it is mediated by K + efﬂux . At this level , the analgesic action of my - colactone appears to share common features with the nonopioid analgesic ﬂupirtine , which also hyperpolarizes neurons by acti - vation of K + channels ( Szelenyi , 2013 ) . Furthermore , the K + channels involved in the mycolactone - mediated hyperpolar - ization appear to be sensitive to TEA and BaCl 2 only at relatively high concentrations ( above 10 mM and 1 mM , respectively ) , 1566 Cell 157 , 1565 – 1576 , June 19 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc .

Identiﬁcation of AT 2 R as the Target Receptor for Mycolactone Involved in Cell Hyperpolarization To further elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms un - derlying the action of mycolactone we seeked to identify its target receptor involved in the K + - mediated hyperpolarization . To this end , we adapted the assay above to the large - scale screening of a siRNA library targeting 8 , 000 different host genes . Macrophage - like cells of the Raw267 . 4 cell line were used in this screening as they are efﬁciently silenced by siRNAs ( Carralot et al . , 2009 ) . We ﬁrst checked that the effect of mycolactone on hyperpolarization in Raw267 . 4 cells is the same as in neurons ( Figure S2 ) . For the screening experiments cells were ﬁrst incu - bated with siRNA and then loaded with DiSBAC 2 ( 3 ) immediately before the addition of mycolactone . A decreased intensity ratio was observed after the addition of toxin to cells that had been incubated with nontarget ( scrambled ) siRNAs ( Figure S3 ) . The most signiﬁcant hits ( roughly 1 % of the total ) were selected from the primary screen , leading to 34 siRNA - targeted genes upon retesting . In this set , only three genes appeared to be asso - ciated with receptors , namely il23r , icam1 , and agtr2 ( Table S1 ) . With this respect , it is noticeable that no genes encoding opioid receptors , common target of analgesics , were found among the most signiﬁcant hits from the siRNA screen . Whereas ICAM1 and IL23R , belonging respectively to the immunoglobulin and inter - leukin receptor families , do not appear to be associated in any—direct—known way with nociceptive pathways , the angio - tensin II type 2 receptor ( AGTR2 or AT 2 R ) represented a favor - able candidate to account for the observed analgesia effects . This receptor has been reported recently , in a completely different context , to be speciﬁcally involved in nociception in the course of experiments testing the effects of the AT 2 R chem - ical antagonist PD123 , 319 ( Anand et al . , 2013 ) . Accordingly we focused our subsequent investigations on AT 2 R receptors . First , we checked that silencing AT 2 R led to a high ratio value compa - rable to that of the scramble control in the absence of toxin ( Fig - ure 3A ) . We then proceeded to investigate in detail the potential role of AT 2 R as a mediator of mycolactone - mediated hyperpolar - ization , seeking to fully characterize and decipher the associated pathway . As a ﬁrst direct characterization , we showed that neu - rons isolated from AT 2 R knockout ( AT 2 R - KO ) mice ( Hein et al . , 1995 ) were not hyperpolarized upon addition of mycolactone , with no observed decrease in DiSBAC 2 ( 3 ) signal ( Figure 3B ) . Furthermore , we assessed in vitro the binding afﬁnity of the my - colactone toxin to human AT 2 R , which displays 95 % amino acid sequence identity with murine AT 2 R . Binding afﬁnity of mycolac - tone to AT 2 R was determined in a radioligand competition assay using the agonist [ 125 I ] CGP42 , 112A ( Pelegrini - da - Silva et al . , 2005 ) . Mycolactone was able to inhibit the AT 2 R agonist with an IC 50 value of 3 m g / ml ( Figure 3C ) . We further analyzed the expression of AT 2 R in our settings and found that AT 2 R was ex - pressed in mouse footpad . In this assay , infection with M . ulcerans did not change signiﬁcantly the level of expression of AT 2 R ( Figure S4 ) , showing that AT 2 R is not upregulated after infection . To further pinpoint the causal role of mycolactone in cell hyperpolarization via AT 2 R receptors we performed two additional assays . First we showed that the AT 2 R - selective antagonist PD123 , 319 inhibits mycolactone - induced hyperpo - larization in neuronal cells ( Figure 3D ) . In addition , it is known that AT 2 R is a G protein - coupled receptor , which couples selec - tively to pertussis toxin ( PTX ) - sensitive Gi a 2 and Gi a 3 proteins ( Kang et al . , 1994 ; Sumners and Gelband , 1998 ) . Upon preincu - bation of the cells with the G - a i inhibitor PTX ( Figure 3E ) , we showed that mycolactone - mediated hyperpolarization was abolished , thus demonstrating that G - a i proteins are involved in mycolactone - induced AT 2 R signaling . In conclusion , inhibi - tion of mycolactone signaling in absence of AT 2 R was demon - strated through three different approaches , relying on chemical inhibition and genetic knockdown as well as genetic knockout . We further checked whether mycolactone could also signal through AT 1 R , as is the case for angiotensin II . As a matter of fact mycolactone displayed binding afﬁnity to the human AT 1 R similar to that measured for AT 2 R ( Figure S5 ) . Accordingly , we tested the effect of mycolactone in an AT 1 R functional assay whereby cytosolic Ca 2 + ion mobilization is measured in HEK293 cells expressing AT 1 R . No effect of mycolactone was observed in this assay , up to 20 m g / ml , showing that despite its binding on the receptor mycolactone does not trigger AT 1 R activation . Conﬁrming this result , we showed that mycolactone signaling was abolished in neurons from mice KO for AT 2 R ( Clere et al . , 2010 ; Hein et al . , 1995 ) not impaired for AT 1 R expression , thus excluding a role for AT 1 R in mycolactone - induced hyperpolarization . AT 2 R Induces Cell Hyperpolarization via Cyclooxygenase Pathway To dissect the mycolactone - induced pathway at the molecular level , we performed a series of additional analyses of our siRNA data , complemented by the screening of a chemical library of inhibitors with known targets . Based on the identiﬁcation of the AT 2 R target above , the rationale in this two - pass screening approach was to reanalyse the siRNA data , with a signiﬁcantly relaxed threshold , in order to further identify relevant genes involved in the underlying pathway seeking notably to bridge the gap between the AT 2 R - input and K + channels - output levels . In this second - pass screening the analyses were conducted in the light of information available in the literature , concerning various alternative pathways associated with the activation of AT 2 R . As a matter of fact , it was documented in the literature that modulation of K + currents by AT 2 R signaling can follow several different intracellular pathways ( Nouet and Nahmias , 2000 ) . The primary reported pathway involves the protein PTPN6 - SHP1 , which becomes phosphorylated upon AT 2 R acti - vation ( Bedecs et al . , 1997 ) . In our cellular model , it was possible to exclude this pathway for AT 2 R - mediated signaling because addition of mycolactone did not result in any notable variation in the amount of phosphorylated SHP1 ( Figure S6 ) . Another reported pathway for AT 2 R modulation of K + currents involves signaling through activation of phospholipase A2 ( PLA 2 ) and release of arachidonic acid ( AA ) ( Lauritzen et al . , 2000 ) . We showed that the AT 2 R - mediated signaling of mycolactone is consistent with this pathway . More precisely , we were able to dissect in detail the triggering of this pathway by mycolactone and to assess the effects of the enzymes involved in the Cell 157 , 1565 – 1576 , June 19 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 1569 Figure 3 .

We found that mycolactone - induced hyperpolarization was inhibited upon silencing of several PLA 2 homologs that mediate the release of AA from membrane phospholipids ( Figure 3F ) . Mycolactone signaling was also impaired upon silencing of cox - 1 ( ptgs1 ) , which con - verts AA into prostaglandins ( Fletcher et al . , 2010 ) ( Figure 3F ) . We showed that inhibition of PTGS1 by the chemical inhibitors FR122047 and Piroxicam abolished mycolactone - mediated hyperpolarization ( Figure 3G ) . As Piroxicam is a nonselective COX inhibitor , we further wanted to investigate the possible involvement of COX - 2 in this pathway . Accordingly , we tested COX - 2 inhibition either by silencing the expression of ptgs2 or by using COX - 2 selective inhibitors ( Dup - 697 and NS398 ) . In both cases , we observed no effects in our assay , thus ruling out a putative role of COX - 2 signaling in our scheme . Reﬁned Characterization of the K + Channels Subfamily Beyond the detailed characterization of the molecular pathway between AT 2 R - input and K + channels - output , the second - pass reanalysis of our siRNA primary screen further allowed reﬁning the characterization of the K + channels in terms of subfamily assignment . More precisely , such reanalysis allowed to pinpoint two possible candidate subfamilies to which the potassium channels involved in the mycolactone - induced hyperpolarization belong , namely KCNK4 ( TRAAK ) and KCNK13 ( THIK1 ) from the K2P channels family ( Figure 3F ) . Channels from the K2P family function as regulatory hubs for the generation of negative resting membrane potentials and therefore they constitute appropriate ﬁnal targets of the signaling pathway involved in the mycolac - tone - induced hyperpolarization . As high concentrations of either barium or TEA reversed the mycolactone - induced hyperpolar - ization , we wanted to investigate the ability of BaCl 2 and TEA to block the activity of TRAAK . We showed that TRAAK is sensi - tive to TEA and BaCl 2 with an IC 50 of 7 ± 2 mM and 0 . 5 ± 0 . 1 mM , respectively ( Figure S7 ) . These IC 50 values are in good agree - ment with the concentration that provokes an inhibition of the mycolactone - induced hyperpolarization ( Figures 2E and 2F ) . Accordingly , we asked the question as to which mediator was involved in TRAAK activation . Based on the evidence above con - cerning the involvement of the cyclooxygenase pathway in the AT2R - induced cell hyperpolarization , it was natural to consider ﬁrst a possible direct role for arachidonic acid , known to activate TRAAK channels . However , we could rule out this possibility , as PTGS1 inhibitors abolished mycolactone - induced hyperpolar - ization . Accordingly , we reasoned that the mediator responsible for the activation of TRAAK channels could correspond to one of the metabolites of arachidonic acid . With this respect , the anal - ysis of our screen data identiﬁed only one relevant candidate , namely the enzyme prostaglandin E synthase 2 ( PTGES2 ) ( Fig - ure 3F ) . Application of PGE2 , the synthesis of which is catalyzed by ptges2 , induced a 4 . 1 ± 0 . 8 - fold increase of the TRAAK current showing that release of potassium via TRAAK can be mediated by PGE2 ( Figure 3H ) . Altogether , these results are consistent with a model in which the mycolactone - induced pathway , via AT 2 R at the input level , results in an increased activity of TRAAK potassium channels at the output level , with the intermediate pathway as detailed above . Blockade of the AT 2 R Signaling Cascade Results in Inhibition of Hypoesthesia Caused by Mycolactone Completing the rationale for this molecular characterization , we further demonstrated its physiological relevance by investigating in vivo the causal role of AT 2 R in hypoesthesia . We ﬁrst veriﬁed that AT 2 Rs are not expressed in neurons in our KO model ( Hein et al . , 1995 ) ( Figure 4A ) . When mycolactone was injected into the footpads of AT 2 R KO mice , the animals exhibited unal - tered pain sensitivity in the tail - ﬂick test , with an average response time of 8 s , which contrasted with a delayed response by an average of 12 s in wild - type animals ( Figure 4B ) . Thus , AT 2 R expression is critical for the occurrence of mycolactone - mediated hypoesthesia under physiological conditions . This result was substantiated by the tail - ﬂick test on wild - type and AT 2 R - KO mice that presented nonulcerative lesions after infec - tion with M . ulcerans ( Figure 4C ) . In addition , upon treating M . ulcerans - infected mice exhibiting edema with the selective AT 2 R blocker PD123 , 319 or with piroxicam , an inhibitor of pros - taglandin synthesis by PTGS1 , we observed the same pain - sen - sitive phenotype as in the AT 2 R - KO animals ( Figures 4D and 4E ) . Taken together our results demonstrate the pivotal role of AT 2 R signaling cascade in Buruli ulcer induced hypoesthesia . DISCUSSION The focus of the work here is the molecular dissection of a previously unanticipated infection strategy employed by a bac - terium that uses the mycolactone toxin as an effective analgesic to annul the pain of the lesions it causes . It was previously believed that absence of pain in Buruli ulcer disease could be attributed to nerve damage , caused by the action of the toxin mycolactone secreted by M . ulcerans . Accordingly , we ﬁrst revisited this hypothesis to test it in detail . We demonstrated , with puriﬁed as well as synthetic mycolactone , that the analgesic effect of the toxin was not accompanied by nerve degeneration . In addition , it is clear that M . ulcerans does not associate with ( C ) Competitive binding of mycolactone to human AT 2 R . Mean ± SD .

Indeed , we have previously shown that the toxin mycolactone can be shuttled within vesicles in human lesions ( Marsollier et al . , 2007 ) . In this background we endeav - ored to explore alternative mechanisms , other than nerve dam - age , accounting for the analgesic effect of mycolactone . Instead , we sought to investigate possible interference of the toxin with neural processes which could be involved in pain perception and we addressed the question of painlessness for early lesions that are not yet necrotic . It is likely that the effect of mycolactone on necrosis is relevant to yet another phenomenon ( Guenin - Mace´ et al . , 2013 ; Sarfo et al . , 2013 ) . At a global level , we ﬁrst demonstrated with electrophysiology that mycolactone , puriﬁed as well as synthetic , exerts a clear - cut effect on membrane potential , inducing hyperpolarization of neurons . Based on this result , we then deployed a coherent , multifaceted approach , to unravel the detailed molecular pathway underlying this effect . In this approach , we identiﬁed , at the input level , AT 2 R receptor as the target of mycolactone . We further conﬁrmed this result by showing that mycolactone - induced hyperpolarization is inhibited upon blocking AT 2 R expression . Similarly , we showed that at the output level hyper - polarization was mediated by K + channels , and we further reﬁned this characterization showing the speciﬁc involvement of TRAAK potassium channels . In order to gain a complete molecular picture of the effect of mycolactone , we further dissected the intermediate pathway between the input and output levels , showing that the intracellular pathway involved ( 1 ) activation of phospholipase A2 , ( 2 ) release of arachidonic acid by COX - 1 and ( 3 ) activation of TRAAK by PGE2 . Finally , to ﬁrmly validate these ﬁndings on physiological grounds , we demonstrated the causal role in vivo of AT 2 R in hypoesthesia . In a global context , it will be interesting in future studies to consider in more detail several aspects of the pathway underly - ing the hypoesthesia model above . Thus , concerning the binding of mycolactone to AT 2 R , the observed difference between afﬁn - ities measured in vitro and quantiﬁcations in tissues ( Figure S7 ) can seem at ﬁrst surprising . However , very little is known about the stability and the metabolism of the toxin in vivo , with the pos - sibility that metabolites derived from the toxin being active on AT 2 R ( Scherr et al . , 2013 ) . The investigation of such possibility can then be of potential pharmaceutical relevance . With this respect , it is also signiﬁcant that a similar range of difference in concentrations between in vitro binding and cellular activity as - says was previously reported for mycolactone in a completely different context ( Guenin - Mace´ et al . , 2013 ) . Another intriguing aspect in our hypoesthesia model concerns the involvement of COX - 1 , whereas analgesic effect of NSAIDs was shown to be Figure 4 .

Such observations clearly identify COX - 1 as central , multifaceted , player in the con - trol of pain . Of course it will be highly informative to determine whether such different mechanisms could be associated with different types of pain . Also COX - 1 is known to mediate anti - inﬂammatory effect in immune cells , raising the question whether the AT 2 R - mediated analgesic effect could also involve other immune cells . As a matter of fact , our demonstration here of the effect of mycolactone on macrophages , again via AT 2 R , rai - ses the possibility that the toxin acts as a multi - target weapon . Even though the scope of the study here concerned neuron tar - gets for hypoesthesia , future studies concerning macrophages should identify the underlying effects ( such as anti - inﬂammatory ) in the case of such targets . Beyond the molecular and physiological characterizations , the ﬁndings here can be cast in more general perspectives relevant to the theme of counteracting pain on health - oriented grounds . It is particularly signiﬁcant to notice that the pathway dissected here involves a natural effector that does not belong to the different classes of analgesics of common use today , such as paracetamol ( or acetaminophen ) , opiate molecules such as morphine , or nonsteroidal anti - inﬂammatory drugs ( NSAID ) such as salicylates . Notably , because of series of , more or less severe , secondary effects it is rather unanimously recognized that new potent analgesics , showing less adverse effects , are highly desirable . With this respect the perspective in connecting the understanding of the implementation of analgesia in natural systems , such as the one described here , to the rational devel - opment of medical pain - killing products does not appear to be unrealistic . Emerging , but as yet disparate , results of genetic as well as pharmacological studies in humans and rodents point toward the critical involvement of various components of the pathway deciphered here in different steps of pain perception and alleviation . Thus , it is highly signiﬁcant that recent studies aiming to identify rare genetic variants associated with pain sensation precisely pinpointed angiotensin pathways as being of critical importance in trait heritability for pain sensitivity ( Williams et al . , 2012 ) . On the other hand AT 2 R receptors have been pinpointed recently , in completely independent contexts , as important potential targets for several synthetic analgesic drugs . Thus , AT 2 R antagonist PD123 , 319 ( also called EMA200 ) was reported to be effective in a rat model of prostate cancer - induced bone pain ( Anand et al . , 2013 ; Muralidharan et al . , 2014 ) . This is further corroborated by the fact that other EMA derivatives , EMA300 and EMA401 , alleviate neuropathic pain through AT 2 R ( Rice et al . , 2014 ; Smith et al . , 2013 ) . It is then well possible that various such results may ﬁt into a coherent yet multifaceted model , inspired by the one developed here ( Figure 5 ) , with the perspective of developing a rational basis for the design and selection of efﬁcient analgesic mole - cules , directly inspired by natural ones . On more immediate grounds and in terms of health policies , unmasking the patho - genesis strategies of the M . ulcerans bacillus should contribute to a more knowledgeable attitude toward the disease and encourage patients to seek care in the early stages of infection . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Bacterium M . ulcerans ( strain no . 1615 ) was originally isolated from a skin biopsy of a human patient from Malaysia ( George et al . , 1999 ) The recombinant M . ulcerans - GFP bacterium ( strain no . JKD8083 ) was derived from an Austra - lian strain in which GFP expression is controlled by the mls SigA - like promoter ( Tobias et al . , 2009 ) . Mycolactones Mycolactones were puriﬁed from M . ulcerans ( strain 1615 ) extracts as previ - ously described ( George et al . , 1999 ) . Mycolactone purity was estimated to be better than 98 % , based on HPLC proﬁles . Mycolactone was diluted to 4 mg / ml in absolute ethanol and stored in the dark in amber glass tubes . Syn - thesisofmycolactonewasdescribedelsewhere ( Gersbachetal . , 2011 ; Scherr et al . , 2013 ) . Synthetic mycolactone was diluted to 500 ng / ml . Animal Experimentation AT 2 R knockout mice were generated and provided by L . Hein ( Hein et al . , 1995 ) . Six - week - old female FV / BN wild - type ( Charles River France , http : / / www . criver . com / ico ) and AT 2 R knockout ( Hein et al . , 1995 ) mice were main - tained under conventional conditions in the animal house facility of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire , Angers , France ( Agreement A 49 007 002 ) , adhering to the institution’s guidelines for animal husbandry . Mouse Models Forinoculationwith M . ulcerans , ﬁftymicrolitresofasuspensioncontaining5 3 10 4 bacteria were injected subcutaneously into the left footpads of mice . For inoculation with mycolactone , ﬁve micrograms of mycolactone diluted in 10 m l of ethanol were injected subcutaneously into the left footpads of mice . In controls , 10 m l of absolute ethanol alonewere injected into the left footpads . Pain Receptive Assay The pain receptive assay was performed by adapting the tail - ﬂick procedure , using the tail - ﬂick unit ( UGO BASILE ) . The sensitivity of the tissue to a noxious thermal stimuluswas measured . Theradiant heat stimuluswas focusedonthe leftfootpad . Theassaywasperformedtwiceeachweekonmicethathadbeen previously anesthetized . This assay was validated by local application of Emla analgesic cream containing 5 % lidocaine / prilocaine ( Astra Zeneca ) . Immunochemistry Aftersacriﬁce , footpadswereremoved , frozeninisopentane cooledto (cid:1) 30 (cid:3) C , and stored at (cid:1) 80 (cid:3) C . Frozen tissues were serially sectioned using a Leica cryostat . Sections ( 12 m m ) were ﬁxed in cold methanol for 10 min and washed three times in PBS before blocking at room temperature for 1 hr in BSA 5 % . Figure 5 .

The preparations were counterstained with 3 m M 4’6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ; Sigma ) for 5 min and washed twice with PBS . Slides were mountedwithanantifading solution andobserved withaconfocal microscope ( LSM , Leica ) . Tissues from seven mice per stage were analyzed , with 50slides per mouse . Mouse Sciatic Nerve Sections for Transmission Electron Microscopy After deep anesthesia , a perfusion with phosphate buffer was performed after section of the femoral artery . Fixation of the tissue was then performed with a second perfusion with 4 % paraformaldehyde and 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer ﬁxation . The sciatic nerve was subsequently isolated by dissection . The samples were ﬁxed for 30 min in 0 . 1 M cacodylate buffer ( pH 7 . 2 ) containing 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde for 1 hr at 4 (cid:3) C and left to stand for 12 hr at 20 (cid:3) C in cacodylate buffer . Specimens were progressively dehydrated and embedded in Araldite ( Fluka ) . After dehydration , thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and Reynold’s lead citrate and then examined on a JEOL 120 EX electron microscope . Cell Culture Macrophage cells ( Raw264 . 7 , ATCC TIB - 71 ) were cultured in RPMI 1640 ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with 10 % heat - inactivated fetal calf serum ( Invitro - gen ) . Pheochromocytoma cell 12 ( PC12 ) cells were plated on collagen IV - coated culture dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10 % horse serum and 5 % fetal bovine serum . After 6 days , differentiation to a neuronal phenotype was induced by incubation in DMEM supplemented with 2 % horse serum , 1 % fetal bovine serum , and 100 ng / ml nerve growth factor ( Invitrogen ) . The culture medium was changed every two days until differentiation was com - plete ( 6 – 7 days ) . Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were prepared from neonatal ( P0 to P2 ) BALB / c and FVB / N mice according to an established protocol ( Banker and Cowan , 1977 ) with minor modiﬁcations . Electrophysiology The membrane potential of PC - 12 cells was recorded using the whole - cell conﬁguration of the patch - clamp technique in the current - clamp mode . PC - 12 cells were grown for 7 days on glass coverslips before being harvested . After an overnight incubation , the glass coverslips were transferred into a recording chamber and continuously superfused with Ringer’s saline buffer containing 125 mM NaCl , 2 . 5 mM KCl , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 . 25 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 26 mM NaHCO 3 , 12 mM glucose , buffered to pH 7 . 4 , at 30 – 32 (cid:3) C and bubbled with 95 % O 2 and 5 % CO 2 . Recording pipettes ( 3 – 5 M U resis - tance ) were ﬁlled with 140 mM potassium gluconate , 5 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 . 1 mM EGTA , 5 mM HEPES , 4 mM MgATP , 0 . 3 mM NaGTP and titrated to pH 7 . 2 with KOH . Membrane potential changes were monitored using anEPC10quadroUSBpatch - clampampliﬁerandPATCHMASTERsoft - ware ( HEKA Electronik , Germany ) . Signals were sampled at 10 Hz , ﬁltered at 3 kHz and analyzed with FITMASTER software ( HEKA Electronik ) . Cells were current - clamped close to their resting potential ( (cid:1) 55 to (cid:1) 65 mV in average ) . Membrane potential was continuously monitored for 10 – 20 min before and 10 – 20 min after mycolactone application at 1 . 4 m g / ml using a pneumatic drug ejection system ( PDES , npi electronic GmbH , Germany ) . Control cells were stimulated with 2 % ethanol as vehicle . For IC 50 determinations for TRAAK , defolliculated Xenopus oocytes were injected with 50 nl of cRNA at 0 . 02 – 0 . 4 m g / m l encoding mTRAAK and recorded 2 – 4 days later . For electro - physiology , single oocytes were placed in a 0 . 3 ml perfusion chamber and impaled with two standard microelectrodes ( 1 – 2 . 5 M U resistance ) ﬁlled with 3 M KCl and voltage clamped with a Dagan CA - 1 ampliﬁer , in ND96 solution ( 96 mM NaCl , 2 mM KCl , 1 . 8 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM HEPES [ pH 7 . 4 ] , with NaOH ) . Stimulation of the preparation , data acquisition , and analysis were performed using pClamp software ( Axon Instruments ) .

After overnight incubation , the medium was removed , and the cells were labeled for 2 hr at 37 (cid:3) C with bis - ( 1 , 3 - diethylthio - barbituricacid ) trimethineoxonol ( DiSBAC 2 ( 3 ) , Invitrogen , B413 ) at62 . 5 m g / ml . Thecellswerethenwashedthreetimeswithimagingbuffercontaining150mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 10 mM HEPES , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 5 . 5 mM glucose , 2 . 9mMsucrose . Aﬁrstseriesofimageacquisitionwasconductedtoascertain the proper labeling of the cells ( T1int ) ; mycolactone was then added to the cells . After 20 min incubation at room temperature under mild shaking ( 500 rpm ) , a second scan was performed to measure the intensity of the ﬂuorescence of the cells ( T2int ) . Confocal images were recorded on an auto - mated ﬂuorescent confocal microscope Opera ( Evotec ) using a 20 3 water objective ( NA 0 . 70 ) , 532 nm laser and 600 nm camera . Four ﬁelds per well were recorded . Each image was then processed using dedicated in - house image analysis software ( IM ) . The image dynamics were checked through a series of statistical tests ( assessing notably average intensities and standard deviations ) , designed to allow the removal of black or out - of - focus images . DiSBAC 2 ( 3 ) staining was then segmented in the ‘‘DiSBAC stain’’ band using an in - house method ( Fenistein et al . , 2008 ) , and the ratio of the surface inten - sity of the ‘‘DiSBAC stain’’ before and after mycolactone addition was deter - mined for each well . This ratio is referred to as the Ratio [ T2int / T1int ] . Competitive Binding of Mycolactone to the Human AT 2 R [ 125 I ] CGP 42 , 112A at 0 . 01 nM was used as agonist radioligand . Radioactivity was detected by scintillation counting ( Cerep Inc , Seattle , WA , Assay Reference 0026 ) . The radioligand was ﬁrst incubated with membranes from human recombinant HEK293 cells and the bound radioactivity was measured . The membranes were then incubated with a high concen - tration of angiotensin II ( 1 m M ) and with [ 125 I ] CGP 42 , 112A radioactive ligand todeterminenonspeciﬁc bindingoftheligand totheAT 2 Rreceptor . Theradio - ligand and the mycolactone ( eight different concentrations ) were incubated with the cell membranes for 4 hr at 37 (cid:3) C to determine the IC 50 of the mycolactone . Chemical Reagents Tetraethylammonium ( TEA ) , an inhibitor of various potassium channels and Piroxicam , a highly active inhibitor of prostaglandin were from Sigma . EMLA cream containing 5 % lidocaine and prilocaine anesthetics was from Astra Zeneca . FR122047 , a selective inhibitor of COX - 1 signaling and PD123 , 319 , a selective inhibitor of AT 2 R signaling were from Tocris Bioscience . For the mouse study , 200 m l ( daily renewed ) solution of piroxicam at 0 . 5 mg / ml in 1 % gelosed water was administered by gavage every day starting 30 days after M . ulcerans inoculation . Osmotic mini - pumps ( AlzetVR model 2002 , Palo Alto , CA ) containing PD123 , 319 were implanted subcutaneously under anesthesia in the back of the neck of mice 30 days after M . ulcerans inocula - tion , with a delivery rate of 20 mg / kg / day in water .
