To gain insight into the molecular basis underlying Tor - dependent signaling , we used cell fractionation and immunoafﬁnity chromatography to examine the physical environment of Tor2p . We found that the majority of Tor2p associates with a membrane - bound compartment along with at least four other proteins , Avo1p - Avo3p and Lst8p . Using immunogold electron microscopy , we observed that Tor2p , as well as Tor1p , localizes in punctate clusters to regions adjacent to the plasma membrane and within the cell interior , often in association with characteristic membra - nous tracks . Cell fractionation , coimmunoprecipitation , and immunogold electron microscopy experiments conﬁrmed that Lst8 associates with both Tor2p as well as Tor1p at these membranous sites . In contrast , we ﬁnd that Kog1 , the yeast homologue of the mammalian Tor regulatory protein Raptor , interacts preferentially with Tor1p . These ﬁndings provide evidence for the existence of Tor signaling complexes that contain distinct as well as overlapping components . That these complexes colocalize to a membrane - bound compartment suggests an intimate relationship between membrane - mediated signaling and Tor activity . INTRODUCTION Understanding how cell growth is controlled in response to environmental signals remains an outstanding biological problem . It has become clear in recent years that the Tor kinases act within an intracellular regulatory network used by eukaryotic cells to regulate their growth according to nutrient availability ( reviewed by Dennis et al . , 1999 ; Schmelzle and Hall , 2000 ; Raught et al . , 2001 ; Rohde et al . , 2001 ) . This network regulates multiple aspects of gene ex - pression , including transcription , translation , and intracellu - lar protein trafﬁcking , making the Tor pathway an important global regulator of cellular activity ( Dennis et al . , 1999 ; Schmelzle and Hall , 2000 ; Raught et al . , 2001 ; Rohde et al . , 2001 ) . Two highly homologous Tor kinases exist in Saccha - romyces cerevisiae , encoded by the TOR1 and TOR2 genes ( Heitman et al . , 1991 ; Helliwell et al . , 1994 ; Zheng et al . , 1995 ) . Both Tor1p and Tor2p are targets of the immune - suppres - sive antibiotic rapamycin , which , in combination with the small immunophilin FKBP , inhibits the activity of these kinases that is required for nutrient - related growth control ( Dennis et al . , 1999 ; Schmelzle and Hall , 2000 ; Raught et al . , 2001 ; Rohde et al . , 2001 ) . In addition to this Tor1p and Tor2p shared function , Tor2p is also required for proper actin cytoskeleton dynamics and polarized cell growth ( Schmidt et al . , 1996 , 1997 ; Schmelzle and Hall , 2000 ) . This Tor2p - speciﬁc function is essential for cell viability and is not inhibited by rapamycin . In recent years , studies by many laboratories have been devoted to elaborating the circuitry of each of the major downstream branches of the Tor1p / Tor2p - shared as well as the Tor2p - speciﬁc functions in yeast ( reviewed in Dennis et al . , 1999 ; Schmelzle and Hall , 2000 ; Raught et al . , 2001 ; Rohde et al . , 2001 ) . These studies have revealed many important details regarding the overall architecture , in terms of the molecular components involved , of the Tor signaling net - work . Moreover , they have revealed that this network inter - sects many other regulatory pathways that control cell growth and polarity . One example of this intersection is the observation that Tor regulates a concise set of metabolic Article published online ahead of print . Mol . Biol . Cell 10 . 1091 / mbc . E02 – 09 – 0609 .

(cid:2) Corresponding author : E - mail address : tpowers @ ucdavis . edu . 1204 © 2003 by The American Society for Cell Biology genes , termed RTG target genes , that encode mitochondrial and peroxisomal enzymes required for de novo biosynthesis of glutamate and glutamine ( Komeili et al . , 2000 ; Shamji et al . , 2000 ) . Butow and coworkers originally identiﬁed these genes as targets of a mitochondria - to - nucleus signaling pathway , or retrograde response pathway , that adjusts their transcription in response to the respiratory state of the cell ( Liao et al . , 1991 ; Liao and Butow , 1993 ; Liu and Butow , 1999 ) . Control of these genes by both pathways involves regulated nucleocytoplasmic transport of the heterodimeric bHLH / Zip transcription factors Rtg1p and Rtg3p , as well as depends on the cytoplasmic protein Rtg2p ( Komeili et al . , 2000 ; Sekito et al . , 2000 ) . These results highlight how Tor signaling is integrated with fundamental aspects of cellular metabolism . Despite this progress , very little is presently understood regarding how the Tor kinases are themselves regulated . These are extremely large proteins , (cid:1) 2000 amino acids in length , and contain several predicted protein - interacting do - mains , including a large N - terminal domain consisting of multiple HEAT repeats ( Andrade and Bork , 1995 ; Schmelzle and Hall , 2000 ) . There have been reports that these repeats are important for interactions with other proteins , as well as membranes , although the precise nature of these interac - tions or their potential role in Tor signaling have not been well characterized ( Sabatini et al . , 1999 ; Bertram et al . , 2000 ; Kunz et al . , 2000 ; Wu et al . , 2002 ) . Given that control of Tor1p and Tor2p activity is likely to be complex , it would not be surprising if these proteins turn out to be involved in inter - actions with multiple partners . Indeed , this prediction has been born out by very recent studies of mammalian Tor ( mTor ) , where several essential regulatory factors that inter - act directly with this protein have been identiﬁed ( Gao et al . , 2002 ; Hara et al . , 2002 ; Inoki et al . , 2002 ; Kim et al . , 2002 ) . One of these proteins , termed Raptor , associates with mTor in a nutrient - regulated manner ( Hara et al . , 2002 ; Kim et al . , 2002 ) . It is also remains unclear precisely where within the cell the Tor kinases reside in yeast . Early immunoﬂuorescence evidence suggested that Tor2p was associated with the vac - uole ( Cardenas and Heitman , 1995 ) . In contrast , results from a more recent study suggest that both Tor2p as well as Tor1p localize primarily to the plasma membrane ( Kunz et al . , 2000 ) . In studies of mammalian cells , mTOR is also primarily membrane associated and has been localized to punctate structures within the cell interior , possibly associated with membranes of exocytic and / or endocytic origin ( Sabatini et al . , 1999 ; Kim and Chen , 2000 ; Zhang et al . , 2002 ) . It has also been reported that mTOR shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus or , alternatively , is localized constitutively to the nucleus in certain malignant cells ( Kim and Chen , 2000 ; Zhang et al . , 2002 ) . Given that their function and reg - ulation are likely to be intimately tied to their site ( s ) of action , a more complete understanding of intracellular loca - tion ( s ) of both Tor1p as well as Tor2p is necessary . Herein , we describe studies that address many of these issues , through the biochemical identiﬁcation of proteins that copurify with Tor2p . We characterize in detail the in - teraction between Tor2p and one of these proteins , Lst8p , which has recently been identiﬁed as a component of the retrograde response pathway ( Liu et al . , 2001 ) . We demon - strate that Lst8p also interacts with Tor1p and that all three proteins localize to an intracellular membranous structure that seems distinct from the plasma membrane . Finally , we ﬁnd that the yeast homologue of Raptor , Kog1p , associates speciﬁcally with Tor1p . MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains , Media , and General Methods All strains were in the W303a background ( leu2 - 3112 ura3 - 52 can1 - 100 ade2 - 1 his3 - 11 trp1 - 11 MAT a ) . Culture medium used was YPD ( 2 % yeast extract , 1 % peptone , and 2 % dextrose ) . Yeast cultures were grown at 30°C for all experiments . DNA ligations were per - formed using the Rapid DNA ligation kit ( Roche Diagnostics , Indi - anapolis , IN ) . Plasmid DNA constructs were transformed into Esch - erichia coli DH5 (cid:1) and grown at 37°C . Yeast transformations were performed using a lithium acetate procedure ( Geitz and Woods , 2002 ) . Synthetic complete dextrose medium ( 0 . 8 % yeast nitrogen base without amino acids , pH 5 . 5 , 2 % dextrose ) was supplemented with amino acids as described previously ( Sherman , 1991 ) . Rapa - mycin ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) and added to a ﬁnal concentration of 0 . 2 (cid:2) g / ml . Anti - hemagglutinin ( HA ) ( HA . 11 ) and anti - Myc ( 9E10 ) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Covance ( Berkeley , CA ) . Anti - Tor1p polyclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech - nology ( Santa Cruz , CA ) . Plasmid Construction Plasmid pFA6a - HisMX6 - PTOR2 - ATG - 3HA ( Figure 1A ) , used for amino terminal tagging of TOR2 with three copies of the HA epitope ( HA 3 ) by integration into the genome of W303a , was con - structed in several steps . First , plasmid pFA6a - His3MX6 - PGAL1 – 3HA ( Brachmann et al . , 1998 ; Longtine et al . , 1998 ) was digested with Bgl II and Pac I to remove the PGAL1 promoter region . The promoter region of TOR2 ( 600 base pairs ) directly upstream of the start was polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) ampliﬁed by using primers that contained the Bgl II or Pac I sites and genomic DNA from strain S288c as template . The PCR product of the TOR2 promoter was digested and ligated into the above - mentioned plasmid to create pFA6a - His3MX6 - PTOR2 – 3HA . Because removal of the PGAL1 promoter also removed the start site , a new start site was generated before the beginning of the 3HA tag . For this , plasmid pFA6a - His3MX6 - PGAL1 – 3HA was used as the template in a PCR reaction where the forward primer included a Pac I site as well as a start codon within its sequence and the reverse primer included the Asc I site at its 3 (cid:2) end . The ampliﬁed PCR product and plasmid pFA6a - His3MX6 - PTOR2 – 3HA were then digested with Pac I and Asc I and ligated together . This ﬁnal plasmid contained a new HA 3 tag and a start codon and is termed pFA6a - HisMX6 - PTOR2 - ATG - 3HA . Construction of a plasmid used for the HA 3 amino terminal tagging of TOR1 was the same as described above except for the following : the pFA6a - HisMX6 - PTOR2 - start - 3HA plasmid was di - gested with Bgl II and Pac I to remove the TOR2 promoter . The promoter regions of TOR1 ( 240 base pairs ) directly upstream of the start codon was ampliﬁed using genomic DNA from strain S288c as a template . Herein , the forward primer included a Bgl II site and the reverse primer included a Pac I site . This PCR product was digested with Bgl II / Pac I and ligated to create pFA6a - HisMX6 - PTOR1 - start - 3HA . Construction of Yeast Strains To fuse the HA 3 tag amino - terminally to TOR2 within the S . cerevi - siae genome , PCR was performed using pFA6a - HisMX6 - PTOR2 - start - 3HA and two TOR2 - speciﬁc gene primers , TOR2 - forward and TOR2 - reverse ( Figure 1A ) . The products from several PCR reactions were concentrated and transformed into W303a by using a lithium acetate procedure ( Geitz and Woods , 2002 ) and grown at 30°C for Membrane - associated Tor Kinase Complexes Vol . 14 , March 2003 1205 Figure 1 . K . P . Wedaman et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 1206 2 – 3 d on synthetic complete dextrose minus Histidine agar plates to select for integrants . Candidate colonies were screened by PCR , by using several primer pairs that identiﬁed putative correct integra - tion events . Genomic DNA was prepared and DNA sequencing of the junctions was performed to conﬁrm that the HA 3 tag was properly integrated . A similar strategy was used to produce amino - terminally tagged HA 3 - TOR1 except that for HA 3 - TOR1 , the plasmid pFA6a - HisMX6 - PTOR1 - start - 3HA was used as the template in a PCR reaction . This reaction also used speciﬁc TOR1 - forward and TOR1 - reverse prim - ers . Transformation and identiﬁcation of integrants proceeded in the same way as that for HA 3 - TOR2 , as described above . A double - tagged strain derived from strain HA 3 - TOR2 that pro - duced a version of Lst8p tagged at its carboxy terminus with mul - tiple copies of the Myc epitope was constructed using the PCR - based gene tagging method and plasmid pFA6a - 13Myc - TRP1 ( Brachmann et al . , 1998 ; Longtine et al . , 1998 ) . LST8 - speciﬁc primers targeted the region directly upstream and downstream of the stop codon . An identical approach was taken to construct versions of Kog1 and Avo1 that were tagged at their carboxy termini with multiple copies of the Myc epitope . The TOR1 gene was disrupted in the HA 3 - TOR2 strain by using a similar PCR - based method and plasmid pFA6a - TRP1 as template ( Longtine et al . , 1998 ) . Primers used corresponded to the very 5 (cid:2) and 3 (cid:2) ends of the TOR1 open reading frame . To verify that strain HA 3 - TOR2 produced full - length HA 3 - Tor2p protein , Western blot analysis was performed . Brieﬂy , 5 OD of cells from strain HA 3 - TOR2 W303a was pelleted and resuspended in 0 . 5 ml of trichloroacetic acid ( TCA ) buffer plus protease and phospha - tase inhibitors . Resuspended cells were combined with 0 . 5 mg of glass beads and 0 . 5 ml of cold 30 % TCA and were vortexed for four 30 - s intervals with cooling on ice during the interim . Supernatants were centrifuged at 20 , 000 (cid:3) g for 5 min at 4°C . Pellets were washed with 1 ml of cold acetone and centrifuged at 20 , 000 (cid:3) g for 5 min at 4°C . Acetone was completely removed and pellets were air dried for 10 min . Pellets were resuspended in sample buffer , incubated for 5 – 10 min at 65°C , and loaded onto 7 . 5 % SDS - PAGE gels followed by staining with Coomassie Blue or transfer to nitrocellulose for anal - ysis for Western blotting . Anti - HA monoclonal antibody was used to detect HA 3 - Tor2p . A similar approach was used to conﬁrm the sizes of the other epitope - tagged proteins described above . Antibody Production Anti - HA polyclonal antibodies were raised by immunizing rabbits with a peptide sequence from the inﬂuenza virus HA epitope ( pep - tide sequence CYPYDVPDYA ) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemo - cyanin . HA antibodies were afﬁnity puriﬁed from serum by using a puriﬁed glutathione S - transferase - HA fusion protein coupled to Afﬁgel 10 ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) as described previously ( Kellogg and Alberts , 1992 ) . Immunoafﬁnity Puriﬁcation and Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Tor2 Complex The following protocol is a modiﬁed form of that published by Kellogg and coworkers ( Mortensen et al . , 2002 ) . Cells producing HA 3 - Tor2p as well as untagged control cells were grown overnight at 30°C to 0 . 5 OD 600 / ml in YPD . Cells were pelleted , washed in H 2 O , pelleted again , and resuspended in yeast extract buffer ( YEB ; 50 mM HEPES - KOH , pH 7 . 1 , 100 mM (cid:3) - glycerol phosphate , 50 mM NaF , 5 mM EGTA , 5 mM EDTA , 10 % glycerol , 0 . 25 % Tween 20 , and 150 mM KCl ) . The pellet was resuspended and transferred to a 50 - ml conical tube , pelleted again , resuspended 1 : 1 ( w / vol ) in YEB containing protease inhibitors ( cocktail tablet ; Roche Diagnostics ) , 2 mM dithiothreitol , and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride , and frozen dropwise by transfer pipet into liquid nitrogen . The cell pellet was then transferred to a prechilled mortar and pestle con - taining liquid nitrogen and ground into a ﬁne powder ( (cid:4) 150 strokes followed by addition of liquid nitrogen repeated three times ) . After liquid nitrogen had boiled off , the powder that remained was trans - ferred to 1 . 5 - ml microfuge tubes , thawed , and centrifuged at 20 , 000 (cid:3) g for 20 min at 4°C . The supernatants ( S1 ) were pooled and centrifuged again as described above . Supernatants ( S2 ) were pooled after removal of the lipid layer at the surface . Then 490 (cid:2) l of S2 was combined with 210 (cid:2) l of saturated ammonium sulfate ( 30 % ﬁnal ) and stirred for 10 min at 4°C . Samples were centrifuged at 20 , 000 (cid:3) g for 20 min . Supernatant was removed and held on ice and the pellet was resuspended in cold YEB buffer to 700 (cid:2) l . Both the supernatant ( S30 - AS ) and resuspended pellet ( P30 - AS ) were dialyzed three times against excess YEB buffer . A clarifying spin of 20 , 000 (cid:3) g for 5 min at 4°C followed and the supernatants ( S30S - AS and P30S - AS ) were removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen . Samples were thawed , placed in Beckman Coulter polyallomer tubes and centrifuged in a TLA45 rotor in a Beckman Coulter TL100 tabletop ultracentrifuge at 100 , 000 (cid:3) g for 1 h at 4°C . Supernatant ( S100 - AS ) was removed and pellet ( P100 - AS ) was resuspended in YEB and passed (cid:4) 20 times through the needle of a Hamilton syringe . The P100 - AS extract was precleared by addition of 25 (cid:2) l of protein A - Sepharose beads ( Amersham Biosciences , Piscataway , NJ ) and 25 (cid:2) l of YEB in 1 . 5 - ml Microfuge tubes to remove material that bound nonspeciﬁcally to protein A . The cleared P100 - AS extract was then combined with polyclonal HA antibody bound to fresh protein A beads for 2 h at 4°C . The beads were then pelleted at 10 , 000 (cid:3) g for 2 min at 4°C and washed 5 (cid:3) with 1 ml of YEB . After the last wash , the supernatant was removed completely using a Hamilton syringe . HA 3 Tor2p was released from the antibody by addition of 75 (cid:2) l of elution buffer ( YEB with 0 . 35 mg / ml of HA dipeptide [ sequence CYPYDVPDYAGYPYDVPDYAG ; Genemed Synthesis , South San Francisco , CA ] ) , followed by incubation for 15 min at Figure 1 ( facing page ) .

At this point , the eluted material was either analyzed by SDS - PAGE and silver stained ( Silver Stain Plus kit ; Bio - Rad ) or by mass spectrometry . For mass spectrometric analysis , 4 liters of starting material was used and the ﬁnal eluted volume was (cid:4) 2 ml . Eluted material was TCA precipitated overnight at 4°C and the pellets were acetone washed and dried . A portion of the material was analyzed by SDS - PAGE and the remaining material was analyzed by mass spectrometry as described previously ( Car - roll et al . , 1998 ; Link et al . , 1999 ) . Coimmunoprecipitation Experiments For coimmunoprecipitation experiments , 400 (cid:2) l of P100 - AS extract was prepared from an appropriate strain and incubated with an - ti - HA or anti - myc mAb overnight at 4°C . Then 25 (cid:2) l of protein G beads ( Amersham Biosciences ) was added and incubated for 2 h at 4°C followed by ﬁve washes in YEB . After the ﬁnal wash , the beads were completely cleared of the supernatant and 30 (cid:2) l of sample buffer was added to the beads . They were then heated at 65°C for 5 min , 95°C for 5 min and loaded onto a 7 . 5 % SDS - PAGE gel . The amount of material loaded for the total and unbound fractions corresponded to 5 % of the material loaded for the bound fractions . Detergent Treatment To detergent treat material in the P100 - AS extract , a P30S - AS extract was thawed and centrifuged at 100 , 000 (cid:3) g for 1 h at 4°C and the pellets were resuspended in YEB . An equal volume of YEB that contained an appropriate concentration of detergent and / or salt was added such that the ﬁnal concentrations were as follows : 1 M NaCl , 1 % Triton - X 100 / 1 M NaCl , 0 . 2 % SDS , 1 % lauryl maltoside , or 1 % SB3 - 10 . Samples were incubated on ice for 30 min during which time they were passed through a Hamilton syringe ﬁve times ap - proximately every 7 min . Samples were again centrifuged at 100 , 000 (cid:3) g for 1 h 4°C . Supernatants and resuspended pellets were either analyzed directly by SDS - PAGE and Western blotting , ap - plied to sucrose gradients , or used in immunoprecipitation experi - ments . Dithiobis ( succinimidylproionate ) ( DSP ) Cross - linking Proteins present in the P100 - AS extract were cross - linked by addi - tion of 18 mM DSP ( Pierce Chemical , Rockford , IL ) in DMSO to a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mM or 1 . 8 mM for 2 h on ice . Cross - linked samples were adjusted to a ﬁnal concentration of 1 % lauryl malto - side on ice for 30 min . Samples were centrifuged at 100 , 000 (cid:3) g for 1 h at 4°C , and the supernatant was removed and quenched by the addition of 1 M Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , to a ﬁnal concentration of 20 mM . Samples were immunoprecipitated and processed for Western blot - ting as described above . Cell Lysis by Spheroplasting Spheroplast formation and cell lysis were performed as described previously ( Nunnari et al . , 2002 ) Sucrose Gradient Ultracentrifugation Sucrose step gradients were prepared from bottom to top in a 2 - ml TLS55 centrifuge tube , where each step contained the following volume of YEB and percentage of sucrose : 200 (cid:2) l of 85 . 5 % , 600 (cid:2) l of 70 % , 400 (cid:2) l of 40 % , and 400 (cid:2) l of 30 % . Extracts were overlayed and gradients were centrifuged in a TLS55 swinging bucket rotor in a tabletop ultracentrifuge at 100 , 000 (cid:3) g for 16 h at 4°C . Fractions were collected from the top of the gradient in 200 - (cid:2) l aliquots and processed for Western blot analysis . Northern Blots Northern - blot analysis was performed as described previously ( Powers and Walter , 1999 ) . DNA probes were generated by PCR by using genomic DNA from strain S288c as template and speciﬁc primers ( Research Genetics , Huntsville , AL ) for individual genes ( ACT1 , RPL30 , CIT2 , DLD3 , and GAP1 ) . Blots were scanned using a STORM 860 imaging system ( Amersham Biosciences , Sunnyvale , CA ) and analyzed using software provided by the manufacturer . Immunogold Electron Microscopy ( IEM ) IEM was performed on ultrathin cryosections as described previ - ously ( Rieder et al . , 1996 ) RESULTS Identiﬁcation of Tor2p - associated Proteins To identify proteins that associate with Tor2p , we used an approach described recently by Kellogg and coworkers for immunopuriﬁcation of endogenous multiprotein complexes from yeast ( Mortensen et al . , 2002 ) . Brieﬂy , this method uses immobilized afﬁnity - puriﬁed polyclonal antibodies raised against the HA epitope to isolate protein complexes where one of the proteins is tagged with HA . Using this approach , protein complexes can be isolated from relatively crude cell extracts and subsequently released by an excess of compet - itive HA dipeptide under mild elution conditions , allowing for the speciﬁc isolation of potentially labile complexes ( Mortensen et al . , 2002 ) . Accordingly , we constructed a yeast strain where the en - dogenous TOR2 gene was fused in frame after sequences coding for HA 3 , expressed under control of its own pro - moter and at its normal chromosomal position ( Figure 1A ) . We chose to position the HA 3 tag at the N terminus of Tor2p because a number of previous studies have shown that different N - terminal tags , including HA 3 , do not interfere with Tor2p function ( e . g . , Kunz et al . , 2000 ) . Moreover , this strategy ensured that only endogenous levels of Tor2p would be produced . The resulting strain , HA 3 - TOR2 , grew as well as its parental wild - type strain on both agar plates as well as in liquid media ( our unpublished data ) . To test the efﬁcacy of the tag , whole cell extracts were prepared from this strain and Western blot analysis was performed , prob - ing for the HA 3 epitope ( Figure 1B ) . The results showed that a single band occurred at the predicted molecular mass of Tor2p of (cid:4) 280 kDa , conﬁrming that the tag was correctly fused to TOR2 and that full - length tagged Tor2p was pro - duced . Initial immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that very little HA 3 - Tor2p protein bound to our immobilized anti - HA antibody from whole cell extracts under native conditions , suggesting the epitope was in an environment not readily accessible to the antibody ( our unpublished data ) . We therefore explored a variety of approaches in an effort to partially purify HA 3 - Tor2p such that interactions with other proteins might be maintained and yet the HA 3 epitope would become accessible . The strategy that was ultimately successful , outlined in Figure 1C , was relatively simple and took advantage of two unique biochemical char - acteristics of HA 3 - Tor2p . First , we found that the majority of this protein in a clariﬁed whole cell extract was effectively precipitated using 30 % ammonium sulfate , whereas most other cellular proteins remained soluble ( Figure 1D , com - K . P . Wedaman et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 1208 pare lanes 5 and 6 ) . Second , we found that the majority of enriched HA 3 - Tor2p was associated with a membranous fraction of very high buoyant density that could be pelleted after high - speed ( 100 , 000 (cid:3) g ) ultracentrifugation ( see be - low ) . This observation is in agreement with the conclusion of Hall and coworkers that Tor2p is primarily a peripherally associated membrane protein ( Kunz et al . , 2000 ) . Thus , through a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and centrifugation steps , we were able to isolate HA 3 - Tor2 in a high - speed pellet fraction , termed P100 - AS ( Figure 1E ) . Quantitative Western blot analysis indicated that the P100 - AS fraction was (cid:4) 30 - fold enriched for HA 3 - Tor2p , rel - ative to the initial extract ( our unpublished data ) . Analysis of the P100 - AS fraction indicated that the major - ity of HA 3 - Tor2p was indeed membrane associated . First , the protein could be converted into a soluble form after treatment with agents that disrupt membranes or mem - brane – protein interactions , including high concentrations of salt and / or a number of nonionic as well as ionic detergents ( Figure 1G ) . Second , HA 3 - Tor2p localized to very dense fractions , corresponding to an equilibrium density of (cid:4) 70 % sucrose , after ultracentrifugation of resuspended P100 - AS on a sucrose step gradient ( Figure 1F ) . We note that this measured equilibrium density of HA 3 - Tor2p in the P100 - AS fraction is signiﬁcantly greater than in whole cell extracts ( Figure 2E ) . We attribute this difference to the likelihood that the puriﬁcation scheme used has altered the protein and / or lipid content associated with HA 3 - Tor2p in the P100 - AS fraction . Approximately 20 – 50 % of HA 3 - Tor2p from the P100 - AS fraction now interacted with immobilized polyclonal an - ti - HA antibody ( Figure 1H , compare lanes 5 and 6 ) . Of this , (cid:1) 90 % could be released upon incubation with com - peting HA dipeptide ( Figure 1H , compare lanes 7 and 8 ) . When the eluate was analyzed by SDS - PAGE , several distinct protein species were detected that coeluted with HA 3 - Tor2p ( Figure 1I , lane 2 ) . These proteins were spe - ciﬁcally associated with HA 3 - Tor2p because they were not present when a control P100 - AS extract , prepared from the parental untagged strain , was used instead for immu - nopuriﬁcation ( Figure 1I , lane 1 ) . We noted that much of the eluted HA 3 - Tor2p seemed monomeric on a sucrose gradient , suggesting that the afﬁnity puriﬁcation step sig - niﬁcantly disrupted interactions between HA 3 - Tor2 and another component ( s ) present in the P100 - AS extract ( our unpublished data ) . To identify the proteins that copuriﬁed with HA 3 - Tor2p , the eluate was digested with trypsin and subjected to tandem mass spectrometric analysis ( Carroll et al . , 1998 ; Link et al . , 1999 ) . For comparison , the untagged control eluate was also analyzed . The results showed that , in addition to Tor2p , a predominant number of unique pep - tides corresponding to four different proteins were present in the eluate from the HA 3 - Tor2p sample ( Table 1 ) . Two of these ( Avo1p and Avo3p ) are encoded by essential genes and , along with Avo2p , were of previously unknown biological function . While this manuscript was in preparation , Hall and coworkers independently iden - Figure 2 . Testing interactions between Lst8p and Tor2p . ( A ) Coimmunoprecipita - tion experiments demonstrating detergent sensitive interactions between Lst8p - Myc and HA 3 - Tor2p . P100 - AS extracts were pre - pared from the indicated strains and immu - noprecipitation reactions were performed using an antibody speciﬁc for one protein ( IP Antibody ) .

Membrane - associated Tor Kinase Complexes Vol . 14 , March 2003 1209 tiﬁed Avo1p - Avo3p as Tor2p - interacting proteins ( Loe - with et al . , 2002 ) . The fourth protein , Lst8p , is encoded by an essential gene and is the subject of further experiments described below . Detergent - sensitive Association between Lst8p and Tor2p Lstp8p was identiﬁed originally in a genetic screen for com - ponents of the exocytic secretory pathway and has been implicated in the regulated intracellular sorting of the gen - eral amino acid permease Gap1p ( Roberg et al . , 1997 ) . Butow and coworkers independently identiﬁed Lst8p as a negative regulator of RTG target gene expression ( Liu et al . , 2001 ) . We as well as others have demonstrated that the Tor kinases also negatively regulate RTG target gene expression ( Komeili et al . , 2000 ; Shamji et al . , 2000 ) . Our identiﬁcation of Lst8p as a protein that copuriﬁes with Tor2p suggested that Lst8p might function as part of the Tor pathway . We therefore decided to explore this relationship in greater detail . We ﬁrst wanted to test whether Lst8p and Tor2p interact physically , as suggested by the results of mass spectrometry . We reasoned that we should be able to perform the recip - rocal experiment and coimmunoprecipitate Tor2p by using an antibody speciﬁc for Lst8p . Accordingly , we introduced into the HA 3 - TOR2 strain a genomically integrated version of Lst8p that was carboxy terminally tagged with the Myc epitope ( Lst8p - Myc ) . This strain grew as well as HA 3 - TOR2 and our untagged parental strain , indicating that the Myc tag did not interfere with the essential function of Lst8p ( our unpublished data ) . We prepared a P100 - AS extract and used an anti - Myc mAb to precipitate Lst8p - Myc , followed by Western blot analysis with an anti - HA mAb to detect HA 3 - Tor2p . The results demonstrated that HA 3 - Tor2p associated with Lst8p - Myc in the P100 - AS extract ( Figure 2A , lane 6 ) . The amount of HA 3 - Tor2p that coprecipitated was similar to that observed when HA 3 - Tor2p was precipitated directly using an anti - HA antibody ( Figure 2A , compare lanes 3 and 6 ) . Moreover , the interaction was speciﬁc because no signif - icant HA 3 - Tor2p was detected when an extract was used that was prepared from HA 3 - TOR2 ( Figure 2A , lane 9 ) . As an additional control , we performed a similar coimmuno - precipitation experiment by using an extract prepared from a strain that produced both HA 3 - Tor2p as well as a Myc - tagged version of Sec8p , a protein that was enriched in the P100 - AS fraction but was not identiﬁed as an HA 3 - Tor2p copurifying protein ( our unpublished data ) . Herein , no as - sociation was observed between HA 3 - Tor2p and Sec8p - Myc ( our unpublished data ) . Treating the P100 - AS fraction with 1 % lauryl maltoside , a nonionic detergent , before immunoprecipitation abolished interaction between HA 3 - Tor2p and Lst8p - Myc , demonstrat - ing their association was stabilized by the presence of a membrane ( Figure 2A , lane 15 ) . As a control , we observed that under these conditions HA 3 - Tor2p was still efﬁciently precipitated with anti - HA antibody and Lst8p - Myc was ef - ﬁciently precipitated with anti - Myc antibody , indicating that the detergent did not interfere with binding of the antibod - ies to their respective epitopes ( Figure 2A , lane 12 ; our unpublished data ) . To test whether these proteins were in a complex within the membrane , we ﬁrst cross - linked pro - teins in the P100 - AS fraction by using the homobifunctional cross - linking agent DSP before detergent solubilization . Un - der these conditions , signiﬁcant coprecipitation of HA 3 - Tor2p and Lst8p - Myc was observed ( Figure 2B , compare lane3 with lanes 4 and 5 ) . Because DSP is believed to pri - marily cross - link proteins that are in proximity ( Deshaies et al . , 1991 ) , we conclude that Tor2p and Lst8p are likely to be in close physical contact within the context of a membrane . Tor2p and Lst8p Colocalize In Situ To further test whether Tor2p and Lst8p act together , we determined their localization within cells . To date , no infor - mation regarding the intracellular location of Lst8p has been reported . Hall and coworkers , on the other hand , have pre - sented evidence , based on cell fractionation and indirect immunoﬂuorescence studies , that Tor2p localizes both at the plasma membrane as well as within the cell interior ( Kunz et al . , 2000 ) . One potential drawback to their study , however , was that Tor2p had to be overexpressed to be visualized by ﬂuorescence microscopy . As an alternative approach , we explored the use of IEM to study the location of these proteins ( Rieder et al . , 1996 ) . This approach has proven successful to localize epitope - tagged proteins expressed at endogenous levels ( Rieder et al . , 1996 ; Wang et al . , 2001 ) . Moreover , by examining protein localization at the ultra - Table 1 . Analysis of Tor2 - associated proteins by mass spectrometry No .

Proteins listed correspond to abundant peptide species identiﬁed by mass spectrometry of trypsin - digested HA 3 - Tor2p copurifying material . Proteins are rank ordered according to the number of unique peptides obtained for each and were uniquely identiﬁed in the strain expressing HA 3 - Tor2p . Additional abundant peptides were obtained corresponding to a number of ribosomal proteins as well as TyB Gag - Pol proteins ; however , many similar proteins were also identiﬁed in the control sample and their presence is thus considered spurious . Several additional proteins speciﬁcally coeluted with HA 3 - Tor2p ; however , these proteins were associated with peptides present in lower amounts and have not been characterized further . K . P . Wedaman et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 1210 structural level , additional insights into their physical envi - ronment in situ can often be obtained ( Wang et al . , 2001 ) . Ultrathin cryosections were prepared from ﬁxed HA 3 - TOR2 cells and were incubated with anti - HA antibody . Sam - ples were then incubated with 10 - nm gold secondary anti - body and visualized by electron microscopy . Clusters of gold particles were found primarily in electron dense re - gions within the cell ( Figure 3 , A – C , arrows ) . A signiﬁcant fraction of these particles were adjacent to the cell periphery , yet at locations clearly distinct from the plasma membrane ( 40 % , n (cid:7) 225 ) . The remaining particles were located pri - marily further within the cell periphery and , of these , a small number ( (cid:4) 12 % , n (cid:7) 65 ) were located in proximity to the vacuole . Very few particles were associated with the nucleus ( 3 % , n (cid:7) 16 ) . In agreement with our biochemical analyses described above , many of the particles were in close associ - ation with membranes , which showed as characteristic tu - bule - like structures , or tracks , of lower electron density ( Fig - ure 3 , D – F , arrowheads ) . These particles speciﬁcally labeled HA 3 - Tor2p because no such signal was detected when the untagged control strain was examined ( our unpublished data ) . We conclude from this analysis that Tor2p associates with a membranous compartment ( s ) that is located both within the cell interior as well as adjacent to the plasma membrane . The presence of Tor2p in electron - dense regions close to the plasma membrane is reminiscent of previous descrip - tions of cortical actin patches ( Mulholland et al . , 1999 ) . This was intriguing given the involvement of Tor2p in actin cytoskeletal dynamics ( Schmidt et al . , 1996 , 1997 ; Schmelzle and Hall , 2000 ) . Therefore , to determine the relationship between the Tor2p - labeled structures and actin patches , we performed a double labeling experiment where actin was labeled with 5 - nm gold particles and Tor2p was labeled with larger 10 - nm gold particles . This experiment took advantage of the fact that the majority of actin detected using this approach is located primarily within actin patches ( Mulhol - land et al . , 1999 ) . Indeed , clusters of smaller gold particles were clearly observed in electron - dense stained structures near the cell periphery ( Figure 4 , A and C , arrowheads ) . These structures were clearly distinct from the HA 3 - Tor2p clusters , however , demonstrating that HA 3 - Tor2p does not localize to actin patches ( Figure 4 , A and C ) . Nevertheless , we noted several examples where actin that was not obvi - ously associated with cortical patches colocalized with HA 3 - Tor2p , often in the vicinity of membrane tracks ( Figure 4 , B and D ) . Although the signiﬁcance of this latter observation remains to be determined , it is consistent with the demon - strated functional relationship between actin organization and Tor2p signaling ( Schmidt et al . , 1996 , 1997 ; Schmelzle and Hall , 2000 ) . We next prepared ultrathin cryosections from HA 3 - TOR2 LST8 - MYC cells and performed a double - labeling experi - ment where HA 3 - Tor2p and Lst8p - Myc were labeled with 10 - and 5 - nm gold particles , respectively . We observed many cases where gold particles of both sizes were in prox - imity to each other , in electron dense stained regions near the plasma membrane as well as within the cell interior ( Figure 4 , E and F ) . Moreover , close inspection revealed the presence of membrane - like tracks at these sites of colocal - ization . We conclude from these results that Lst8p and Tor2p interact and colocalize to an intracellular membranous site ( s ) within the cell . Lst8p Associates with Tor1p In addition to the observed colocalization of Tor2p and Lst8p in the IEM analysis described above , there were sev - eral instances where the signal from one protein was not within the vicinity of the other ( Figure 4 , E and F ; our unpublished data ) . This result suggested that a portion of these proteins were not associated with one another . We reasoned that one possible explanation for this observation was that Lst8p might also interact with Tor1p . To test this idea directly , we performed a similar coprecipitation exper - iment to that described previously and immunoprecipitated Lst8p - Myc from a P100 - AS extract and probed for the pres - ence of Tor1p , by using a polyclonal antibody directed against this protein . As a control , we ﬁrst conﬁrmed that this anti - Tor1p antibody was speciﬁc for Tor1p in our strain background , because no signal corresponding to the pre - dicted molecular weights of Tor1p or Tor2p could be de - tected upon deletion of the TOR1 gene ( Figure 5A , compare lane 1 with lanes 2 and 3 ) . We observed that a portion of Tor1p indeed coprecipi - tated with Lst8p - Myc ( Figure 5B , lane 2 ) . The interaction was speciﬁc because no Tor1p coprecipitated from an extract prepared from a control strain producing untagged Lst8p ( Figure 5B , lane 6 ) . As with Tor2p and Lst8p , no association was evident if the P100 - AS fraction was ﬁrst solubilized with 1 % maltoside , indicating that interaction between these pro - teins was detergent sensitive ( Figure 5B , lane 3 ) . Addition of the cross - linking agent DSP to the P100 - AS fraction before detergent solubilization restored signiﬁcant coprecipitation of Tor1p , indicating that Tor1p , like Tor2p , is likely to inter - act directly with Lst8p ( Figure 5B , lane 4 ) . We also examined whether Tor1p interacted with another Tor2p - copurifying protein , Avo1p . For this , we constructed a genomically integrated version of Avo1p that was carboxy terminally tagged with the Myc epitope ( Avo1p - Myc ) . Con - trol experiments demonstrated that Avo1p - Myc was efﬁ - ciently immunoprecipated from cell extracts by using mono - clonal anti - Myc antibody ( Figure 5C , lane 3 ) . However , no coprecipitation of Tor1p was observed ( Figure 5 C , lane 12 ) . Similarly , no coprecipitation of Avo1p - Myc was observed when Tor1p was the target of immunoprecipitation ( Figure 5C , lane 6 ) . These results are in agreement with results of Hall and coworkers who have reported that Avo1 , as well as Avo2 and Avo3 , interact exclusively with Tor2 ( Loewith et al . , 2002 ) . In agreement with results from coprecipitation experi - ments , we observed that Lst8p - Myc displayed a sedimenta - tion proﬁle that was overlapping with respect to the proﬁles of Tor1p as well as HA 3 - Tor2p , when whole cell extracts were analyzed by equilibrium density ultracentrifugation ( Figure 5D ) . In contrast , the sedimentation proﬁle of Avo1 - Myc was shifted to more dense fractions and seemed most similar to the proﬁles of HA 3 - Tor2p and , to a lesser extent , Lst8p - Myc ( Figure 5D ) .

Membrane - associated Tor Kinase Complexes Vol . 14 , March 2003 1213 Tor1p localized to a region of the cell that was fundamen - tally distinct from what we determined for Tor2p . Accord - ingly , we constructed strain HA 3 - TOR1 that produced a version of Tor1p under the control of its own promoter and tagged at its amino terminus with HA 3 , as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS . Ultrathin cryosections were prepared from ﬁxed cells and HA 3 - Tor1p was visu - alized by IEM ( Figure 4G ) . As was observed for HA 3 - Tor2p , HA 3 - Tor1p directed gold particles were observed both adjacent to the plasma membrane as well as within the cell interior ( Figure 4 , compare A and G ) . In many cases , these particles were clustered in electron dense regions and were often associated with characteristic membrane tracks ( Figure 4G ; our unpublished results ) . Thus , we conclude that at least a portion of Tor1p is in an environment very similar to that of Tor2p . Interestingly , however , we detected many unclustered Tor1p - directed gold particles dispersed throughout the cytoplasm ( our unpublished data ) . Although the signiﬁcance of this latter observation will require further investigation , it is con - ceivable that this more dispersed Tor1p signal corre - sponds to the population of Tor1p that occurred in frac - tions of lesser buoyant density on sucrose gradients ( Figure 5D ) .

Molecular Biology of the Cell 1214 Interactions between Lst8p and Tor Proteins Withstand Rapamycin Treatment To explore the functional relationship between Lst8p and Tor2p as well as Tor1p , we asked whether inhibition of Tor signaling by rapamycin affected their association . Accord - ingly , HA 3 - TOR2 LST8 - MYC cells were treated with rapa - mycin or with drug vehicle alone ( DMSO ) for 30 min , fol - lowed by preparation of P100 - AS fractions . As a control , Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the expression patterns of several Tor - regulated genes were affected in a characteristic manner by rapamycin , conﬁrming the efﬁcacy of the drug in this strain background ( Figure 6A , compare lanes 1 and 2 ) . Coprecipitation reactions were performed , where Lst8p - Myc was immunoprecipitated with anti - Myc antibody , followed by Western blot analysis to detect HA 3 - Tor2p or Tor1p . No signiﬁcant difference in the amount of Tor1p or HA 3 - Tor2p coprecipitated with Lst8p - Myc was observed in rapamycin treated vs . untreated samples ( Fig - ure 6C , compare lanes 3 and 6 as well as lanes 15 and 18 ) . In addition , we found that starvation for nitrogen as well as carbon sources also did not appreciably affect the association of these proteins ( our unpublished data ) . Taken together , we conclude that Lst8p interacts stably with both Tor1p and Tor2p under at least these conditions known to inﬂuence Tor - dependent signaling . Finally , we examined the sedimentation behavior of Tor1p and Tor2p on sucrose gradients in extracts pre - pared from either rapamycin treated or untreated cells ( Figure 6B ) . No signiﬁcant change in the sedimentation proﬁle of either protein was evident , suggesting that their overall cellular distribution is unaffected by drug treat - ment . Similar results were observed when cells were starved for carbon as well as nitrogen sources ( our un - published data ) . These results suggest that changes in Tor signaling are unlikely to be accompanied by a dramatic relocalization of either Tor1p or Tor2p . Figure 6 . Testing the effects of rapamycin treatment on the associ - ation between Lst8p and Tor1p as well as Tor2p . ( A ) Control experi - ment demonstrating that previ - ously characterized Tor - regulated target genes are inﬂuenced by rapamycin ( Powers and Walter , 1999 ; Komeili et al . , 2000 ; Shamji et al . , 2000 ) . Shown are results of Northern blot analysis , where RPL30 mRNA levels are decreased by rapamycin treatment , as de - scribed previously ( Powers and Walter , 1999 ) . In contrast , expres - sion of CIT2 and DLD3 , genes reg - ulated by Rtg1p and Rtg3p , as well as GAP1 , regulated by Gln3p , are all induced after drug treatment , as described previously ( Komeili et al . , 2000 ; Shamji et al . , 2000 ) . ( B ) Sedimentation proﬁles of Tor1p and Tor2p obtained from cells that were either treated or not treated with rapamycin . Clariﬁed whole cell extracts were prepared from strain HA 3 - TOR2 after treatment with either rapamycin or drug ve - hicle alone and were subjected to ultracentrifugation on sucrose gra - dients . Fractions were then col - lected and analyzed by Western blotting to detect HA 3 - Tor2p or Tor1p . ( C ) Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrating that the association of Lst8p with both Tor1p and Tor2p is stable to rapa - mycin treatment . The indicated strains were grown in YPD and treated with rapamycin , followed by preparation of P100 - AS extracts . Lst8p - Myc was then immunopre - cipitated and the presence of HA 3 - Tor2p and Tor1 was monitored by Western blot analysis . Membrane - associated Tor Kinase Complexes Vol . 14 , March 2003 1215 Kog1p Interacts Speciﬁcally with Tor1p While our studies were in progress , two groups reported interactions between mTOR and a novel regulatory partner , termed Raptor ( Hara et al . , 2002 ; Kim et al . , 2002 ) . A homo - logue of this protein is identiﬁable in S . cerevisiae , encoded by an essential gene , YHR186C , recently named KOG1 ( Loe - with et al . , 2002 ) . We wanted to determine whether Kog1p was associated with Tor2p yet escaped detection by mass spectrometry . Accordingly , we constructed a strain that produced both HA 3 - Tor2p as well as a version of Kog1p that was tagged at its C terminus with multiple copies of the Myc - epitope ( Kog1p - Myc ) . This strain displayed no growth defect , indicating that the Myc epitope did not interfere with the essential function of Kog1p ( our unpub - lished observations ) . Extracts were prepared and HA 3 - Tor2p as well as Kog1p - Myc was immunprecipitated sep - arately using anti - HA or anti - Myc monoclonal antibodies , respectively , followed by Western blot analysis . Each tagged protein was precipitated effectively using its cor - responding antibody ( Figures 7A , lane 3 , and 6B , lane 6 ) . In no case , however , was signiﬁcant coprecipitation ob - served , indicating that Tor2p and Kog1p do not interact , at least under these experimental conditions ( Figures 7A , lane 6 , and 6B , lane 3 ) . In contrast to these results , a signiﬁcant amount of Tor1p coprecipitated with Kog1p - Myc ( Figure 7C , lane 6 ) . This interaction was speciﬁc because no Tor1p precipitated when control beads were used without antibody ( Figure 7C , lane 12 ) . Moreover , no Tor1p was precipitated by anti - Myc anti - body in a strain that did not contain Myc - tagged Kog1p ( our unpublished observations ) . To further examine their inter - action , we performed the reciprocal experiment and deter - mined that Kog1p - Myc was coprecipitated when antibodies directed against Tor1p were used for immunoprecipitation ( Figure 7B , lane 9 ) . During these experiments , we also mon - itored interactions between HA3 - Tor2p and Tor1p ; no sig - niﬁcant coprecipitation was observed , indicating these pro - teins do not associate stably under these experimental conditions ( Figures 7A , lane 9 , and 6C , lane3 ) . DISCUSSION Evidence for Distinct Tor Kinase Protein Complexes in S . cerevisiae We have used a biochemical approach to identify a number of proteins that copurify with Tor2p , namely , Avo1p - Avo3p and Lst8p . Of these proteins , we have shown that Lst8p interacts directly with both Tor2p as well as Tor1p . More - over , we have found that Avo1p associates with Tor2p but not with Tor1p . We also observed that Kog1p , the yeast homologue of the recently identiﬁed mTor regulatory pro - tein Raptor , associates with Tor1p but not Tor2p . Finally , we ﬁnd no evidence for a direct interaction between Tor1p and Tor2p . Taken together , these results provide evidence for the existence of Tor kinase signaling complexes that contain distinct yet overlapping components in S . cerevisiae ( summa - rized in Figure 6D ) . While this manuscript was in preparation , Hall and co - workers reported the identiﬁcation of two distinct Tor - con - taining protein complexes ( Loewith et al . , 2002 ) . Based on their observations , the Tor2p - associated proteins we have identiﬁed ( Table 1 ; Figure 6D ) most likely correspond to what they have termed Tor complex 2 ( TORC2 ) . Similarly , our described interactions between Tor1p , Lst8p , and Kog1p ( Figure 6D ) likely correspond to their described TORC1 ( Loewith et al . , 2002 ) . In contrast to their ﬁndings , we did not detect a signiﬁcant interaction between Kog1p and Tor2p . This discrepancy is likely due in part to the observation that , in mammalian cells , interactions between mTOR and Raptor are dynamic and potentially unstable ( Hara et al . , 2002 ; Kim et al . , 2002 ) . We note that for three of the four Tor2p copurifying proteins we have identiﬁed , Avo1p , Avo3p , and Lst8p , their predicted molecular weights correspond closely to proteins identiﬁable by SDS - PAGE ( Table 1 and Figure 1I ) . These proteins did not stain as intensely as Tor2p , however , nor could a speciﬁc band corresponding to the predicted molec - ular weight of Avo2p be detected . At present , there are several possible explanations for the apparent substoichio - metric occurrence of these proteins relative to Tor2p , includ - ing the fact that our immunopuriﬁcation of HA 3 - Tor2p par - tially disrupted interactions with other components . Future studies will be aimed at characterizing the precise stoichi - ometry and dynamics of these complexes . Moreover , at present it is unknown whether these Tor - associated proteins represent potential targets for Tor kinase activity or whether they instead modulate Tor activity . Intracellular Membrane Association of Tor Kinases A second major ﬁnding presented herein is that Tor1p , Tor2p , and Lst8p ( and presumably Avo1p - Avo3p ) all local - ize to membranous structures that are proximal to , yet dis - tinct from , the plasma membrane and also within the cell interior . These ﬁndings are consistent with results pointing to the fact that in mammalian and yeast cells the Tor kinases are predominantly membrane associated ( Sabatini et al . , 1999 ; Kim and Chen , 2000 ; Zhang et al . , 2002 ) . However , they contrast with the plasma membrane localization reported by Hall and coworkers by using indirect immunoﬂuorescence ( Kunz et al . , 2000 ) . We attribute this difference to two pos - sible factors . First , we have examined the localization of these proteins by IEM , which provides higher resolution information regarding subcellular localization , compared with immunoﬂuorescence microscopy . Second , we moni - tored endogenous levels of the Tor proteins whereas Hall and coworkers monitored Tor proteins that were overex - pressed by use of the strong GAL1 / 10 promoter , making it possible that these proteins were mislocalized to the plasma membrane ( Kunz et al . , 2000 ) . Importantly , however , these disparate observations concerning Tor localization could point to the possibility that the Tor proteins cycle , perhaps through an endocytic pathway . This possibility would pro - vide an explanation for the observation that a signiﬁcant portion of Tor2p fractionates in a manner similar to plasma membrane proteins , which often partly localize to endo - membrane structures ( Shaw et al . , 2001 ) . In support of this idea , at the electron microscopy level these Tor - associated characteristic membranous tracks are morphologically most similar to membranes associated with the endocytic path - way ( Rieder et al . , 1996 ; Mulholland et al . , 1999 ; Wang et al . , 2001 ) . The possibility that the membranous structures associated with the Tor kinases are endosomal in origin is also appeal - K . P . Wedaman et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 1216 ing given the emerging connection between endocytosis and sphingolipid biosynthesis ( Friant et al . , 2001 ; Anderson and Jacobson , 2002 ; Dickson and Lester , 2002 ) . Speciﬁcally , a number of recent studies indicate that sphingolipid - medi - ated signaling is linked to proper endocytosis as well as actin cytoskeletal organization ( Friant et al . , 2001 ; Anderson and Jacobson , 2002 ; Dickson and Lester , 2002 ) . In this con - text , it is signiﬁcant that Avo3p , one of the Tor2p copurify - ing proteins we identiﬁed , was discovered originally in a genetic screen for components involved in sphingolipid bio - synthesis ( Beeler et al . , 1988 ) ( note in this manuscript Avo3p / YER093C is named TSC11 ) . Remarkably , TOR2 was also identiﬁed in this genetic screen , emphasizing a relation - ship between Tor signaling and processes connected , albeit indirectly , to endocytosis ( Beeler et al . , 1988 ) . It is also be - coming increasingly clear that the endocytic compartment is Figure 7 . Kog1p associates with Tor1p . ( A – C ) Immunoprecipita - tion experiments were performed from extracts prepared from a strain that expressed both HA 3 - Tor2p as well as Kog1p - Myc , by using an antibody speciﬁc for a given protein ( IP target ) . Western blot analysis was then used to de - tect the presence of the indicated protein . Control beads indicates that Sepharose beads linked to protein G were used without a primary antibody . ( D ) Summary of relationships established in this study , where a (cid:5) indicates an as - sociation between a given protein with Tor1p and / or Tor2p was ob - served and a (cid:6) indicates that no signiﬁcant association is ob - served . Note that we have deter - mined only that Avo1p does not interact with Tor1p and have not yet tested interactions between Avo2p , Avo3p , and Tor1p . Membrane - associated Tor Kinase Complexes Vol . 14 , March 2003 1217 the site of a signiﬁcant number of signaling events related to the control of cell growth and morphogenesis in yeast as well as in higher eukaryotes ( Harsay and Schekman , 2002 ; Seto et al . , 2002 ) . Considering the multitude of processes affected by the Tor kinases , many of which are inﬂuenced by extracellular events , the endocytic compartment represents an attractive location to anchor Tor - dependent signaling . Several additional observations are inconsistent , however , with an endosomal location for the Tor kinases or their associated proteins . First , in cell fractionation and equilib - rium density ultracentrifugation studies , we failed to ob - serve signiﬁcant copuriﬁcation of Tor2p , Tor1p , or Lst8p and markers of the endocytic pathway , such as Rsp5p and Pep12p , which are involved in early and late steps , respec - tively ( Wang et al . , 2001 ) ( our unpublished data ) . Hall and coworkers also reported little similarity between the bio - chemical behavior of Tor2p and different endocytic marker proteins ( Kunz et al . , 2000 ) . Moreover , attempts by these investigators to correlate Tor2p - dependent events and the activity of the endocytic pathway have yielded largely neg - ative results ( Beck et al . , 1999 ; Kunz et al . , 2000 ) . These studies , however , do not exclude the possibility that the Tor - signaling complexes described here are nevertheless as - sociated with a novel branch of the endocytic pathway that has escaped detection by experiments attempted thus far . Another observation that potentially conﬂicts with an en - dosomal location for Tor is that Lst8p , which we have dem - onstrated interacts with both Tor1p as well as Tor2p , was originally identiﬁed in a genetic screen for components in - volved in the exocytic secretory pathway ( Roberg et al . , 1997 ) . Analysis of an lst8 - 1 mutant suggested an involve - ment in regulated delivery of nutrient - regulated permeases , such as Gap1 , to the plasma membrane ( Roberg et al . , 1997 ) . As the initial screen was designed to identify components that interacted with Sec13p , a component of COPII transport vesicles , the proposed model was that Lst8p is involved in a post - Golgi step of the secretory pathway ( Roberg et al . , 1997 ) . However , it was acknowledged that , because the ef - fect of the lst8 - 1 allele on Gap1p trafﬁcking is similar to growth on preferred nitrogen sources ( e . g . , glutamate ) , namely , increased trafﬁcking of Gap1p to the vacuole , it thus remains equally possible that Lst8p is involved in a signal - ing pathway related to nitrogen metabolism . As detailed below , we believe that this latter possibility is likely to be the case . In any event , however , the precise identity of the membranous compartment ( s ) associated with the Tor com - plexes described herein must await future identiﬁcation . Tor Kinases and Lst8 : Further Convergence of Tor and Retrograde Signaling Additional mutations in the LST8 gene distinct from lst8 - 1 , speciﬁcally the lst8 - ( 2 - 5 ) alleles , were identiﬁed genetically by isolating cells that expressed the RTG target gene , CIT2 , in the absence of Rtg2p ( Liu et al . , 2001 ) . Further analysis showed that these mutations can alleviate the glutamate auxotrophy of an rtg2 (cid:8) strain and that Lst8p is a negative regulator of RTG target gene expression ( Liu et al . , 2001 ) . This screen for Rtg2p bypass mutants also identiﬁed MKS1 as a negative regulator of the RTG target genes ( Sekito et al . , 2002 ) . Both Lst8p and Mks1p have been placed within the context of mitochondrial retrograde signaling , possibly by linking intracellular glutamate levels to the activity of Rtg1p and Rtg3p ( Liu et al . , 2001 ; Sekito et al . , 2002 ) . We as well as others have also identiﬁed Mks1p as a negative regulator of the RTG pathway ( Dilova et al . , 2002 ; Tate et al . , 2002 ) . Moreover , we have presented evidence that the phosphorylation state of Mks1p is inﬂuenced by Tor signaling ( Dilova et al . , 2002 ) . Our ﬁnding herein that Lst8p interacts with both Tor1p as well as Tor2p suggests that Lst8 also is involved integrally in Tor signaling . Together these results substantiate the mechanistic similarities between ret - rograde control of RTG target gene expression and Tor - dependent control of these genes ( Komeili et al . , 2000 ; Sekito et al . , 2000 ) . An exception to this overall agreement between the two responses concerns the phosphorylation state of Rtg3p , where retrograde induction of the pathway correlates with dephosphorylation of this protein ( Sekito et al . , 2000 ) . In contrast , we observed that induction of RTG target gene expression by rapamycin treatment results in an apparent hyperphosphorylation of Rtg3p ( Komeili et al . , 2000 ) . We have recently been able to attribute this discrepancy to dif - ferences in strain backgrounds as well as the precise com - position of media used in these published studies ( Dilova , unpublished data ) . We therefore believe that the fundamen - tal mechanism ( s ) by which the RTG target genes are regu - lated is likely to be very similar between the Tor and retro - grade pathways . We have found that interactions between Lst8 and the Tor kinases are not perturbed by rapamycin treatment or by nutrient starvation . It will be important to determine whether any of the identiﬁed Lst8p mutants affect interactions with Tor or , alternatively , with any of the Tor - associated proteins we have identiﬁed . CONCLUSION It has been suggested that the Tor kinases act as a “mul - tichannel processor , ” integrating diverse upstream nutrient - related signals to speciﬁc downstream responses ( Shamji et al . , 2000 ) . For this to occur , the Tor proteins must be able to differentially control distinct downstream targets according to the precise nutritional state of the cell . The existence of distinct Tor1p and Tor2p containing multiprotein complexes in yeast suggests a mechanism for this differential regula - tion . We propose that unique Tor complex components function to specify the targets of Tor kinase activity , which to date remain largely unidentiﬁed . We also propose that their colocalization and shared components function to pro - mote cross talk between these distinct Tor complexes . Fi - nally , we are intrigued by the observation that the Tor kinases are associated with membranous structures located both proximal to the plasma membrane as well as within the cell interior . Given the emerging connection between intra - cellular signaling events and membrane - mediated protein trafﬁcking , we believe this membrane association represents an important area for future investigation into the activity and regulation of the Tor kinases .
