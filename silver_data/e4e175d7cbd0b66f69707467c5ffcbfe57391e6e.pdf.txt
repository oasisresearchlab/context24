Brief Communication 1399 Phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate is required for endocytic coated vesicle formation Matthias Jost * , Fiona Simpson * , Jennifer M . Kavran † , Mark A . Lemmon † and Sandra L . Schmid * Receptor - mediated endocytosis via clathrin - coated vesicles has been extensively studied and , while many of the protein players have been identified , much remains unknown about the regulation of coat assembly and the mechanisms that drive vesicle formation [ 1 ] . Some components of the endocytic machinery interact with inositol polyphosphates and inositol lipids in vitro , implying a role for phosphatidylinositols in vivo [ 2 , 3 ] . Specifically , the adaptor protein complex AP2 binds phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) , PtdIns ( 3 ) P , PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and inositol phosphates . Phosphatidylinositol binding regulates AP2 self - assembly and the interactions of AP2 complexes with clathrin and with peptides containing endocytic motifs [ 4 , 5 ] . The GTPase dynamin contains a pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain that binds PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 to regulate GTPase activity in vitro [ 6 , 7 ] . However , no direct evidence for the involvement of phosphatidylinositols in clathrin - mediated endocytosis exists to date . Using well - characterized PH domains as high affinity and high specificity probes in combination with a perforated cell assay that reconstitutes coated vesicle formation , we provide the first direct evidence that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is required for both early and late events in endocytic coated vesicle formation .

This assay measures the cytosol - and ATP - dependent sequestration of receptor - bound biotinylated transferrin ( BTfn ) into coated vesicles and constricted coated pits ( Figure 1 ) . Supplementing this reaction with purified AP2 complexes stimulates the de novo formation of functionally active coated pits increasing the efficiency of sequestra - tion of BTfn into constricted coated pits [ 9 ] . The differ - ence between the two curves in Figure 1 ( shown in the inset ) provides a selective measure of AP2 - dependent sequestration of BTfn and reflects early events in coated vesicle formation . We first examined the effect of the aminoglycoside anti - biotic neomycin on endocytosis . Neomycin binds PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 with reasonably high affinity and specificity [ 10 ] . Addition of neomycin to perforated A431 cells potently inhibited the sequestration of BTfn measured in either the presence or absence of supplemental AP2 ; half - maximal inhibition required ~ 120 m M neomycin ( see Sup - plementary material published with this paper on the internet ) . In contrast , > 300 m M neomycin was required to half - maximally inhibit AP2 recruitment onto endosomes [ 11 ] . Several controls established the specificity of the neomycin effect ( see Supplementary material ) . To obtain more direct evidence for a specific PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 requirement in endocytosis we used differ - ent PH domains as probes . Many proteins involved in signal transduction or cytoskeleton function contain a protein module of about 100 amino acids originally identi - fied in the protein kinase C substrate , pleckstrin [ 12 ] . These PH domains have been well characterized , both structurally and functionally . They bind phosphoinosi - tides [ 12 , 13 ] and can be divided into several groups according to their affinity and specificity for phospho - inositide binding [ 14 , 15 ] . For this study , we used the fol - lowing PH domains that represent three distinct groups : the PH domain of general receptor of phosphoinositides - 1 ( Grp1 ) that specifically binds PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and Ins ( 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 4 with high affinity [ 15 , 16 ] ; the PH domain of phospholipase C d ( PLC d ) that specifically binds PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 with high affinity [ 17 ] ; and the monomeric PH domains of dynamin - 1 and dynamin - 2 that bind with low affinity to PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 [ 7 ] . These PH domains provide ideal probes for detecting a specific requirement for phos - phatidylinositols in endocytosis . Strikingly , only the PLC d PH domain ( PLC d - PH ) inhib - ited AP2 - stimulated sequestration of BTfn ( Figure 2a ) ; the Grp1 , dynamin - 1 and dynamin - 2 PH domains had no effect . Interestingly , in contrast to the effects of neomycin ( see Supplementary material ) , none of the PH domains , including PLC d - PH , inhibited the residual BTfn seques - tration obtained at limiting concentrations of cytosol ( Figure 2a ) . This signal is believed to derive from the con - striction of coated pits previously assembled in vivo . The observed differences in the effects of neomycin and PLC d - PH support concerns raised by others regarding the specificity of neomycin [ 18 , 19 ] . To confirm that inhibition by PLC d - PH was due to its ability to bind PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 with high affinity , we constructed a mutated PLC d PH domain . Mutations were introduced at two residues ( K32A and W36N ) that form hydrogen bonds with Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 in the X - ray crystal structure of the PLC d - PH – Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 complex [ 20 ] . These mutations effectively abolished binding of both PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 by PLC d - PH as assessed by lipid dot - blots , gel filtration and isothermal calorimetry binding assays ( data not shown ) . As seen in Figure 2b , wild - type PLC d - PH potently inhibited AP2 - stimulated BTfn sequestration , but the mutated PH domain had no effect , even at the highest concentration tested . Half - maximal inhibition by wild - type PLC d - PH occurred at ~ 3 m M , which is in good agreement with its reported K d for binding to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 of ~ 2 m M [ 17 ] . These experi - ments demonstrate the validity of using PH domains for assessing the role of specific phosphoinositides in mem - brane trafficking events . Moreover , because PLC d - PH inhibited AP2 - stimulated BTfn sequestration whereas Grp1 - PH did not , our results provide direct evidence that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , but not PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , is required for AP2 - stimulated early events in coated vesicle formation . To more specifically identify the PLC d - PH - sensitive event in coated vesicle formation , we used a two - staged assay that measures AP2 recruitment to perforated cell membranes [ 9 ] . Perforated A431 cells were first pre - incu - bated at 4°C in the presence of buffer , PH domain or AP2 . The membranes were then collected by centrifugation and subjected to a second incubation , at 37°C , in the presence of BTfn , limiting cytosol and an ATP - regenerating system , and in the presence or absence of AP2 and PH domains . Pre - incubation of membranes with buffer alone had no effect on the AP2 - stimulated BTfn sequestration observed in the subsequent 37°C incubation ( Figure 3 , assay 1 ) . In contrast , when AP2 was included in the 4°C pre - incuba - tion , the membranes became primed with AP2 complexes and efficient BTfn sequestration was observed in the sub - sequent 37°C incubation , even in the absence of supple - mental AP2 ( Figure 3 , assay 2 ) .

BTfn uptake in perforated A431 cells was measured as described [ 8 , 9 ] . Incubations were performed in the presence of the indicated concentration of K562 cell cytosol in the presence or absence of added AP2 . The inset shows the AP2 - specific stimulation of cytosol - dependent BTfn sequestration . For subsequent experiments , BTfn sequestration was measured at 2 mg / ml cytosol which allows for maximum AP2 - dependent stimulation .

These data suggest that prebound AP2 com - plexes can be displaced by wild - type PLC d - PH , probably because it has a higher affinity for PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and / or a lower off - rate compared to AP2 . Thus , PLC d - PH appears to specifically inhibit the de novo formation of coated pits that occurs in the presence of supplemental AP2 com - plexes . Once coats are fully assembled , their association with the membrane appears to be resistant to disruption by PLC d - PH . Interestingly , pre - incubation of perforated cells with wild - type PLC d - PH ( Figure 3 , assay 3 ) blocked AP2 - stimu - lated BTfn sequestration in the subsequent incubation at 37°C . Again , the constriction of preformed coated pits , detected at limiting cytosol concentrations in the absence of supplemental AP2 complexes , was unaffected . In con - trast , mutated PLC d - PH had no such effect ( Figure 3 , assay 4 ) . These data exclude the possibility that the PH domain acts on soluble inositol phosphates , and instead suggest that the PH domain is recruited to the plasma membrane , even at 4°C , and prevents subsequent AP2 recruitment . These findings are consistent with previous studies suggesting that there are discrete AP2 docking sites on the plasma membrane [ 21 ] . Although there is good evidence that these docking sites are protease sensi - tive [ 21 ] , our findings strongly suggest that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is also a necessary component . We were unable to detect an effect of isolated dynamin PH domains on endocytosis in vitro presumably because they have a low affinity for inositol lipids [ 7 , 22 ] . Recent evidence , however , suggests a role for dynamin – phos - phatidylinositol interactions in endocytosis in vivo [ 23 ] . Dynamin is concentrated at coated pits and is required for late events in endocytosis leading to the detachment of clathrin - coated vesicles [ 1 ] . We therefore sought evidence for a requirement for inositol lipids using an assay that selectively measures late events in endocytosis . Coated vesicle formation in perforated cells is specifically detected when receptor - bound transferrin which has been biotinylated via a cleavable disulfide bond ( BSSTfn ) , is taken up into sealed vesicles and becomes inaccessible to the small membrane - impermeant reducing agent , b - mer - captoethane sulfonate , sodium salt ( MesNa ) [ 8 , 24 ] . Coated vesicle formation in this assay requires cytosol and ATP ( Figure 4a ) and is inhibited by GTP g S [ 24 ] . Similarly to its effect on early events , PLC d - PH inhibited the late events in endocytosis that lead to the formation of endo - cytic coated vesicles ( Figure 4 ) . Half - maximal inhibition required ~ 5 m M PLC d - PH ( Figure 4b ) , comparable to the levels required for inhibition of AP2 - dependent BTfn sequestration . The extent of inhibition appeared to plateau at ~ 50 % , perhaps reflecting an inability of PLC d - PH to interfere with the substantial membrane - bound pool of dynamin known to be concentrated at coated pits . Importantly , other PH domains had no effect ( Figure 4a ) , nor had the mutated PLC d - PH ( Figure 4b ) , confirming that the observed inhibition was due to the ability of wild - type PLC d - PH to bind PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . The use of PH domains with well - characterized binding affinities and specificities for distinct phosphatidylinosi - tols has provided the first direct evidence that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is specifically required for early events in clathrin - mediated endocytosis leading to coat assembly and for late events leading to coated vesicle detachment . These steps correspond to those requiring AP2 and dynamin , respectively , and our results are consistent with observations that both proteins bind phosphatidylinosi - tols . Moreover , our data suggest that a tighter specificity of lipid interactions exists in the functional context of coated vesicle formation than has been reported for the interac - tions of these proteins with phosphatidylinositols in vitro . A specific requirement for PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in endocytic coated vesicle formation , as opposed to phosphatidylinosi - tols phosphorylated in the D - 3 position , is consistent with the observation that concentrations of wortmannin suffi - cient to inhibit PtdIns 3 - kinases ( 25 nM ) stimulate the rate of transferrin internalization in vivo [ 25 ] . ATP hydrol - ysis is known to be required for both coat assembly and Brief Communication 1401 Figure 3 A staged assay reveals that wild - type PLC d - PH inhibits coat formation by competing with AP2 for the same membrane - docking site . Perforated A431 cells were pre - incubated at 4°C under four different conditions : assay 1 , with buffer alone ; assay 2 , with AP2 ( 100 m g / ml ) ; assay 3 , with wild - type ( WT ) PLC d - PH ; and assay 4 , with mutant PLC d - PH . Membranes were collected by brief centrifugation , resuspended , and incubated under normal assay conditions at 37°C in the presence or absence of added AP2 or PH domains as indicated .

Perfo - rated A431 cells were pooled from 10 culture dishes ( 150 · 25 mm ) and stored at – 70°C in ten 80 m l aliquots in 0 . 75 M sucrose , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 25 mM Hepes - KOH , pH 7 . 4 . One aliquot , resuspended in 300 ml KSHM ( 100 mM K - acetate , 85 mM sucrose , 1 mM Mg - acetate , and 20 mM Hepes - KOH , pH 7 . 4 ) was sufficient for 35 in vitro assay reactions . Cytosol was prepared from K562 cells as described [ S3 ] with the exception that the cells were homogenized by N 2 - cavitation bomb at 500 psi for 20 min in KSHM including Com - plete protease cocktail ( Boehringer Mannheim ) . Internalization assays were performed at limiting cytosol concentrations ( 2 mg / ml ) in the presence or absence of 100 m g / ml AP2 . Incubation time was 20 min at 37°C . AP2 complexes were purified after extraction from a micro - somal pellet as described [ S3 ] and stored at – 70°C in KHM ( KSHM without sucrose ) . For AP2 priming experiments , perforated A431 cells were preincu - bated in KSHM + 0 . 5 % BSA with either no addition , AP2 ( 100 m g / ml ) , or wild - type or mutant PLC d - PH ( 6 mM each ) for 15 min at 4°C as indi - cated in Figure 3 . Subsequently cells were sedimented ( 5 sec , 14000 · g , 4°C , Eppendorf microfuge ) and reincubated at 37°C under standard assay conditions including an ATP - regenerating system , cytosol and AP2 or the PLC d - PH domains [ S3 ] . The MesNa assay was carried out as previously described [ S1 , S2 ] with the following modifications . 3T3L1 undifferentiated adipocytes ( kindly provided by S . van Delft and A . J . Verkleij , Utrecht ) were permeabilized after washing in KSHM by freezing a culture dish ( 150 · 25 mm ) in liquid N 2 and rapid thawing at 37°C . Cytosol was prepared from frozen rat brains ( Pelfreez ) as previously described [ S1 ] . Perforated cells , recov - ered by scraping and low speed sedimentation , were preincubated with BSSTfn for 15 min at 4°C prior to the addition of other reagents . Specificity controls for neomycin effects As controls for the specificity of neomycin , we tested several related aminoglycoside compounds ( kindly provided by W . Greenberg and C . - H . Wong ) , not known to bind PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . These included : 2 - des - oxystreptamin , a neomycin derivative with one amino - sugar that con - tains two instead of six primary amino - groups ; neamine , a neomycin derivative with two O - linked amino - sugars ; and the neomycin - related antibiotics gentamycin and kanamycin that have four instead of six primary amino groups . None of these compounds detectably inhibited cytosol - dependent or AP2 - stimulated BTfn sequestration , even when tested at 500 m M ( data not shown ) . Thus , the inhibitory effect of neomycin on the formation of constricted coated pits was most likely due to its ability to bind PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . We also controlled for other nonspecific effects of neomycin that might be due to its polycationic character and resulting nonspecific interac - tions with a variety of anionic proteins , as seen in other studies [ S4 ] . As a control for nonspecific neomycin - induced protein aggregation , cytosol was preincubated with or without 600 m M neomycin for 15 min at 4°C and then subjected to centrifugation ( to pellet aggregated pro - teins ) and gel filtration ( to remove added neomycin ) . There was no dif - ference in the ability of the neomycin pretreated cytosol to support BTfn sequestration in perforated cells as compared to control cytosol ( data not shown ) . Preparation and characterization of wild - type and mutant PH domains All PH domains were produced as soluble proteins in Escherichia coli BL21 - DE3 by expression from pET11a at 37°C . The dynamin - 1 and dynamin - 2 PH domains were produced as described [ S5 ] . The PLC d - PH ( wild - type and mutant ) were produced as described [ S6 , S7 ] . The Grp1 PH domain was produced as described [ S8 ] . All proteins were at least 95 % pure as assessed by overloaded Coomassie - blue - stained SDS – PAGE . Residues K32 and W36 in rat PLC d - PH were mutated to Ala ( A ) and Asn ( N ) respectively using a standard four - primer PCR method ; the sequence was confirmed , and protein was purified as described for wild - type PLC d - PH [ S7 ] . Whereas strong binding of wild - type PLC d - PH to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 is seen in a lipid dot - blot assay [ S7 ] and by gel - filtration with [ 3 H ] Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 [ S6 ] , respectively , the mutated PLC d - PH gave no binding signal in either assay ( J . M . K . and M . A . L . , unpublished observations ) . Using isothermal titration calorime - try [ S6 ] , the mutations were found to increase the K d for Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 binding from 0 . 21 m M ( wild - type ) to significantly more than 10 m M ( K32A / W36N ) , indicating that the mutated PH domain binds Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 > 50 - fold more weakly than wild - type PLC d - PH ( data not shown ) . Supplementary material Figure S1 AP2 - stimulated transferrin sequestration in perforated cells is inhibited by neomycin . Addition of neomycin , at the concentrations indicated , inhibited cytosol - dependent BTfn sequestration assayed in either the presence or absence of added AP2 . The inset shows the extent of neomycin inhibition expressed as a percentage of the control . The results show the average ± SD from three experiments .
