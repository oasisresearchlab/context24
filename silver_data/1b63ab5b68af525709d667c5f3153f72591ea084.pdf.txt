334 The Use of Negative Interface Cues to Change Perceptions of Online Retributive Harassment SONG MI LEE , School of Information , University of Michigan , USA ANDREA K . THOMER , School of Information , University of Michigan , USA CLIFF LAMPE , School of Information , University of Michigan , USA Online retributive harassment refers to a range of abusive online behaviors targeted at offenders with the intent of sanctioning norm violations . Online retributive harassment is common in online interactions , can be devastating in its effect , and is hard to moderate . We examined the role that negative interface cues ( i . e . , Dislikes , flags ) might have in changing people‚Äôs harassment perceptions to mitigate this activity . We conducted a 4 √ó 2 between - subjects experiment ( ùëÅ = 242 ) to test the effects of interface cues ( control with Likes only vs . Dislikes outnumbering Likes vs . Likes outnumbering Dislikes vs . a flag with Likes ) and harassment severity ( low vs . high ) on how people perceive retributive harassment . We hypothesized that Dislikes and flags , despite the presence of Likes , signal social disapproval and descriptive norms against harassment and thus reduce bystanders‚Äô belief that retributive harassment is appropriate , deserved , or justified . We found that Dislikes can be effective when they outnumber Likes in high - severity harassment but backfire when outnumbered by Likes . A flag , contrary to popular practice , does not have a significant mitigating effect on perceptions of retributive harassment . We demonstrate the potential of negative interface cues to signal anti - harassment norms to bystanders and discuss alternatives to social media platforms‚Äô one - size - fits - all content moderation approach .

Such beliefs can lead to online retributive harassment , which refers to personal attacks made against another online participant with the intent to punish a violation of norms [ 6 ] . Klonick [ 42 ] described it as a type of public shaming intended to harm people as a form of punishment rather than to enforce social norms . Marwick [ 48 ] used the term morally motivated net - worked harassment to describe when a norm - violating individual is being harassed by a networked community of people . This type of harassment can be a pervasive problem in online interactions .

Thomer , and Cliff Lampe In an early example , a huge online mob directed insults , rape threats , and death threats at Justine Sacco ( then a public relations executive ) for her racist jokes on Twitter . Sacco was fired by her employer , moved to another country , and changed occupations , all of which were noted and ridiculed online [ 55 ] . In another example , South Korean social media users across multiple platforms doxxed ( i . e . , spread personally identifiable information online to direct harassment ) middle school bullies who brutalized and nearly killed their classmate but only received a light penalty [ 44 ] . With the sharp increase of online shaming [ 34 ] , online vigilantism [ 63 ] , online whistle - blowing [ 45 ] , and cancel culture [ 8 ] in the last decade across many countries , retributive harassment is a fast - growing concern . Previous work has shown widespread approval of retributive harassment [ 6 ] . This study extends that work by examining how interface cues might disrupt perceptions of retributive harassment . Retributive harassment mitigation is uniquely challenged by bystanders‚Äô ambivalence around harassment . The targets of retributive harassment have often violated some broadly held social norms , and bystanders might be unwilling to empathize with someone they perceive as a wrongdoer . Retributive harassment might be perceived as morally justified depending on ( 1 ) the severity of harassment [ 43 , 46 ] ; ( 2 ) bystanders‚Äô own punitive justice beliefs [ 6 ] ; and ( 3 ) how others have positively or negatively reacted to the harassment , reflected in helpful or hurtful comments [ 6 ] , or valenced interface cues ( e . g . , Likes , Dislikes , a flag ) . Here , the term interface cue is used to refer to user interface elements that signal reactions from other users or the system . Positive interface cues such as Likes and shares can encourage bystanders to favor cyberbullying or vigilantism [ 31 , 54 ] , but there is little research on any mitigating effect of negative interface cues . Negative interface cues can signal social norms against harassment and change bystanders‚Äô perceptions accordingly , but such a possibility has not been examined . According to the theory of negativity effect [ 40 ] , negative cues have greater informational value than positive ones , even when smaller in number , and thus form negative impressions of the object . Dislikes or a flag might be able to outweigh Likes and mitigate bystander perceptions in favor of retributive harassment‚Äîbut conditionally so , considering different levels of harassment severity and bystanders‚Äô punishment orientation at play . To examine these questions , we conducted a 4 √ó 2 between - subjects online experiment with hypothetical retributive harassment on social media , varying the interface cues ( control with only Likes vs . Dislikes outnumbering Likes vs . Likes outnumbering Dislikes vs . a flag with Likes ) and harassment severity ( low vs . high ) . We randomly assigned participants ( ùëÅ = 242 ) across the eight conditions . We measured participants‚Äô perceived appropriateness , deservedness , and justifiability of retributive harassment [ 6 ] and their likelihood to intervene via Liking , Disliking , flagging , and commenting . Our mixed results suggest that a Dislike function is perhaps too quickly dismissed out of fear of abuse [ 75 ] without full consideration of its potential against harassment , while a flag might be overly trusted in its ability to signal users what not to do . We suggest that making public resistance to harassment more visible might deter the normalization of harassment in online spaces and that understanding people‚Äôs psychosocial characteristics is important for harassment mitigation . Against a fast - growing breadth of harassment tactics , social media platforms need to be better equipped with both theoretically and empirically tested nudges and warnings [ 66 ] . This paper has three contributions : First , it describes a test of Dislikes and flags grounded in the theory of negativity effect and discusses relevant theories to solidify theoretical frameworks of cues for social norms and harassment . Second , it extends the work of interface design for bystander intervention by adding empirical evidence of retributive harassment and negative interface cues . Third , it suggests design implications around Dislikes and flags and highlights the importance of understanding individuals‚Äô Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 6 , No .

The Use of Negative Interface Cues to Change Perceptions of Online Retributive Harassment 334 : 3 psychosocial characteristics in mitigating online harassment , thus proposing alternatives to social media platforms‚Äô one - size - fits - all content moderation approach . 2 RELATED WORK 2 . 1 Online Retributive Harassment Is Hard to Moderate Online retributive harassment is difficult to moderate for two primary reasons : ( 1 ) the highly retributive disposition of the individuals engaging in this type of harassment , and ( 2 ) the ways that social media affordances aggregate and escalate individual retributive actions . Morality theories indicate that when people see two wrongs ( i . e . , the target‚Äôs original violation and retributive harassment ) , they tend to take sides with the perceived ‚Äúlesser evil‚Äù rather than to reject both [ 20 , 21 , 61 ] . Individuals who do engage in retributive harassment might not see themselves as harassers . Instead , they might think they are achieving justice through ‚Äúan eye for an eye‚Äù type of counterattack out of a sense of self - respect [ 33 , 37 , 53 , 74 ] or collective sympathy for the victim of the original violation [ 62 ] . For instance , many adolescent girls respond to cyberbullying through cyberbullying back and receiving help from their online peers in that effort [ 9 ] . Because of such seemingly empathetic motives , retributive harassment sometimes receives ambivalent framing by the media as irrational yet understandable [ 52 , 68 ] . Blackwell et al . [ 6 ] found that bystanders , like harassers , are individuals with their own punish - ment orientation and propensity for retributive justice . In their online experiment , bystanders who favored retributive justice perceived online harassment targeted at an offender as not appropriate , but still justified and deserved . They were also more likely to publicly call out the harassment target‚Äôs behavior rather than the harasser‚Äôs . Such findings underscore that online harassment is not restricted to a few bad actors but is something many online participants engage in [ 14 ] . It is erroneous to presume bystanders will assist harassment targets irrespective of their psychosocial tendencies and the context of harassment . The ability of the Internet to aggregate individual actions can easily escalate retributive harass - ment and turn it into devastating mob justice [ 42 ] . Klonick [ 42 ] identified anonymity , ubiquitous access , and the endless memory of the Internet as aggravating factors . Social media features that afford association building , such as Friends , Following , Likes , shares , feeds , comments , replies , direct mentions , hashtags , and up / downvotes [ 67 ] , can also accumulate not only social capital but also antagonistic attention . With these features , individuals who make independent decisions to sanction a norm violation can quickly become a harassment brigade . Marwick [ 48 ] specifically described morally motivated networked harassment ( MMNH ) as a situation in which a norm - violating individual is harassed by a community of people connected by social media . Crucial to the MMNH model is the role of amplifiers often taken by social media accounts with many followers . Amplifiers , knowingly or not , can deliver and boost harassment to their large audience even with a simple retweet [ 36 , 48 ] . The responsibility for the consequent network - wide harassment by the audience is obscure . This challenges the current platform or legal regulations that center on one - to - one harassment [ 48 ] and automatically detect and ban certain abusive content or actors [ 13 , 36 ] . Furthermore , the primary impulse to punish wrongdoing occurs rapidly before conscious rea - soning [ 10 ] . Thus , policy - based moderation and community guidelines that demand deliberate cognitive efforts to practice might be ineffective in preventing retributive harassment . When policy - based and automated moderation mechanisms fail to address the fact that online retributive harassment is socially justified and promoted [ 6 , 48 ] and often done without much contemplation [ 10 ] , the target suffers massively adverse consequences that are outsized from their initial violation .

Thomer , and Cliff Lampe 2 . 2 Interface Cues Can Signal Normative Behavior to Bystanders As bystanders‚Äô pile - on brings the perpetuation and escalation of retributive harassment , it is crucial to mitigate bystanders‚Äô retributive intentions so that the chance of their benevolent intervention increases . Interface - based moderation approaches might achieve this goal through the use of unobtrusive nudges and signals . Interface elements can add priming or design friction [ 50 ] , which allows people to slow down and be more conscious of their behavior . For instance , Seering et al . [ 60 ] employed CAPTCHAs in the comment section to prime positivity and analytical thinking . Interface elements can also nudge bystanders‚Äô sense of personal responsibility and empathy toward the harassment target [ 22 , 65 ] . DiFranzo et al . [ 22 ] identified a large audience size indicator and view notifications ( i . e . , the poster is notified of who has read a harassing comment to their post ) , making personal accountability against harassment more noticeable . These combined actions increased perceptions of public surveillance and elicited indirect bystander intervention via flagging . Taylor et al . [ 65 ] used empathy nudges in the comment prompt that invited bystanders to think about the harassment target‚Äôs feelings along with a view notification . While the empathy nudge underperformed in a scaled - up simulated platform , the view notification eventually led to an increase in perceived accountability for bystanders‚Äô behavior . Moreover , interface elements can publicly signal how the audience or community is responding to harassment , which informs bystanders of normative behavior . The cues - filtered - out perspective says that , in cue - sparse mediated environments , people are more likely to misinterpret intention and have a harder time detecting what norms they should follow [ 71 ] . Interface cues that aggregate other users‚Äô reactions ( e . g . , Likes , Dislikes , ratings , and up / downvotes ) or show the system‚Äôs response to user requests ( e . g . , flagged content ) reflect what other people are doing and what they prefer [ 72 ] ‚Äîin other words , the descriptive social norm [ 16 ] . Because these aggregations are the byproduct of users‚Äô natural online behaviors [ 72 ] , they are deemed hard to fake and thus more trustworthy than user - editable content ( e . g . , postings ) [ 23 , 71 ] . Therefore , interface cues might be more influential than individual bystanders‚Äô postings or comments in signaling normative behavior . Theoretically , negative interface cues that aggregate negative responses to harassment could signal anti - harassment norms . However , we do not have empirical evidence that they influence bystanders‚Äô perceptions , especially when contested by positive interface cues . On many popular social media platforms , positive interface cues in postings such as Likes and shares are default or markedly visible‚Äîthough ambiguous in nature [ 32 ] ‚Äîwhereas negative interface cues are less common . This indicates that harassment and the endorsement thereof can be more visible , but public resistance to that harassment is not [ 7 ] . One might choose to ignore harassment and not take any actions , but that can also be interpreted as a silent acceptance of the situation [ 64 ] . Such skewed representation of responses can favor the escalation of harassment , especially the retributive type that depends on social justification . In this paper , we experimented to learn whether , and under what circumstances , negative interface cues‚ÄîDislikes and flags‚Äîcan mitigate online retributive harassment in the presence of positive interface cues . This work advances our theoretical and empirical knowledge of negative interface cues as an interface - based moderation tool . It also contributes to online bystander research by observing bystanders who might be predisposed to be antagonistic toward the harassment target . 2 . 3 Dislikes and Flags as Negative Interface Cues Dislikes publicly show the unmediated aggregate number of negative or disapproving responses social media users assign to content . In most cases , a single - click Disliking action gets immediately Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 6 , No . CSCW2 , Article 334 . Publication date : November 2022 . The Use of Negative Interface Cues to Change Perceptions of Online Retributive Harassment 334 : 5 reflected in the Dislike count shown on the interface . Dislikes do not give room for negotiation or justification between the poster and raters [ 38 ] or for the platform‚Äôs interference . On the other hand , flags are embedded reporting tools for users to alert platforms of abuse or policy violations . As Crawford and Gillespie [ 18 ] described , flagging is ‚Äúmerely the first step in a process of content regulation‚Äù that requires the platform to assess the violation and come back with its moderation decision . However , the decision is often obscured through the opaque process of content regulation and complex negotiation between users and platforms as well as between social norms and regulatory policies [ 18 ] . Users can conceptually distinguish between Disliking and flagging [ 38 ] , but flagged content is more likely to be Disliked than non - flagged content [ 14 ] . Also , when Disliking is unavailable , users tend to flag posts to show their disapproval [ 29 ] . While much attention has been paid to Disliking and flagging as indirect bystander actions against harassment or incivility , the resulting Dislikes and flags as received signals for other bystanders remain understudied and unclear [ 18 , 38 ] . Flags are often speculated to be a stronger warning against abuse than Dislikes because they forcefully indicate the intervention and potential enforcement by platforms [ 38 ] , but empirical evidence is scarce . Our study serves to fill this gap . Bhandari et al . [ 4 ] , implicitly based on the assumption that seeing a flag can induce bystander intervention , tested the effect of revealing who flagged the content‚Äîunspecified vs . other users vs . artificial intelligence ( AI ) . Contrary to their expectation , bystanders who saw an unspecified flag were more likely to flag additional harassment . They reasoned that seeing others‚Äô or AI‚Äôs moderation could lead bystanders to feel their actions would be dispensable or futile . However , bystanders did perceive higher personal accountability and greater helpful norms when other users flagged the content . These findings allude that Dislikes and flags might set the social context for bystanders‚Äô negative sense - making of harassment , though not all of them take direct action against it . It should be noted that Dislike and its variants have been predominantly framed as a potential harassment tool . They can be used for trolling [ 14 ] or more tactically abused via mass downvoting or vote brigading to spread toxicity against women and marginalized populations [ 49 ] . Lutz and Schneider [ 47 ] showed that receiving Dislikes can be seen as social rejection and is more hurtful to one‚Äôs sense of belonging and self - esteem than receiving no response . However , examining Dislikes‚Äô benign use against harassment would help us have a balanced view and leverage diverse social disincentives for online violence . Harassers , including inadvertent or latent ones , might feel bad seeing Dislikes , and such emotional consequences are what disincentivizes divergence from social norms [ 19 ] . 2 . 4 The Negativity Effect Predicts That Negative Cues Outweigh Positive Cues When assessing negative interface cues , it is necessary to consider that positive interface cues such as Likes are a more prevalent and established default of social media [ 32 ] . This ( hypothetical ) juxtaposition raises the question of which cues have a relatively greater influence on perceivers . Kellermann [ 40 ] defined the negativity effect as the tendency of people to attach greater weight to negative information than positive information [ 72 ] . For instance , negative product reviews or evaluations of a person , despite often being smaller in number than positive ones , tend to draw more attention from online consumers and social media users . One explanation is that producing negative information is essentially regarded as a non - normative behavior . Flattering and commenting about positive aspects are very common because they are often assumed to be normative . Positive remarks are also easily influenced by situational factors such as social relations and societal expectations . Therefore , the informativeness of positive information is likely to be discounted in people‚Äôs perceptions . Conversely , negative information is less frequent and thus is more salient , easily noticeable , and readily processed . Further , because of the perceived Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 6 , No . CSCW2 , Article 334 . Publication date : November 2022 . 334 : 6 Song Mi Lee , Andrea K . Thomer , and Cliff Lampe social risk of publishing , negative information is deemed to be more diagnostic and to reveal more about the true aspects of the subject . Studies also found that the more individuals strive for accuracy , the more they support a new piece of negative information [ 1 ] . Analogous to this perspective is the negativity bias , or the propensity to respond more quickly to and learn more from negative stimuli than positive stimuli , which has been observed by many studies of cognitive , affective , and social behavior ( e . g . , [ 12 , 69 ] ) . Yet advertising scholarship on two - sided signals has maintained that the influence of negative information on people‚Äôs perceptions is contingent on many variables , including how much negative information is included , where it is placed , and the perceived correlation between positive and negative attributes [ 59 ] . Thus , the negativity effect needs to be tested in a specific context‚Äîin our case , that of online retributive harassment and bystander perceptions . Promisingly , consistent with the theory of negativity effect , Blackwell et al . [ 6 ] found that one disagreeing comment , despite being outnumbered by five other conforming comments , significantly reduced the perceived deservedness and justifiability of retributive harassment . Therefore , we tested whether a similar result could be drawn with negative interface cues when they are strongly or weakly contested by positive interface cues in retributive harassment . 3 METHOD 3 . 1 Hypotheses Our study tested whether the negativity effect of Dislikes or flags would lower users‚Äô perception of how appropriate , deserved , and justified retributive harassment is . We examined three variables : high Dislikes , where Dislikes outnumber Likes ; low Dislikes , where Likes outnumber Dislikes ; a flag , a flag with Likes . Despite the numerical differences , the theory of negativity effect guided us to hypothesize that not only high Dislikes ( H1 ) but also low Dislikes ( H2 ) and a flag ( H3 ) form negative impressions of retributive harassment . While we focused on the effect of the interface cues on perceptions of retributive harassment , the severity of harassment itself [ 26 , 43 , 46 ] is a significant factor in bystander behavior . Online bystander literature has noted that the more severely insulting the harassment is , the more willing people are to intervene and support the harassment target [ 43 , 46 ] . In particular , Koehler et al . [ 43 ] found that if bystanders perceive the harassment as not so severe , they are more prone to blaming the harassment target . That is , the negative cues‚Äô desirable effect can be dampened if the harassment severity is low . Thus , we hypothesized that the negative cues‚Äô effect of mitigating bystanders‚Äô harassment perceptions is more prominent in more severe harassment . In addition , bystanders‚Äô own punitive dispositions might come into play [ 6 ] ( H4 ) . The findings from Blackwell et al . [ 6 ] indicate that while bystanders‚Äô punishment orientation is not easily influenced by external factors , it is a significant determinant of bystanders‚Äô perceptions of retributive harassment . We expected to see a three - way interaction effect in which punishment orientation was a moderating variable . In sum , we hypothesized and asked : ‚Ä¢ H1 . High Dislikes decreases bystanders‚Äô perceived ( a ) appropriateness , ( b ) deservedness , and ( c ) justifiability of retributive harassment , especially in cases of more severe harassment . ‚Ä¢ H2 . Low Dislikes decreases bystanders‚Äô belief that online retributive harassment is ( a ) appro - priate , ( b ) deserved , and ( c ) justified , especially in cases of more severe harassment . ‚Ä¢ H3 . A flag decreases bystanders‚Äô belief that online retributive harassment is ( a ) appropriate , ( b ) deserved , and ( c ) justified , especially in cases of more severe harassment . ‚Ä¢ H4 . Bystanders‚Äô punishment orientation moderates the interaction effect of the interface cues and harassment severity . Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 6 , No . CSCW2 , Article 334 .

What subjective factors ( perceptions , intentions , emotions ) influence bystanders‚Äô likeli - hood to intervene in retributive harassment ? To test our hypotheses , we conducted an online experiment with a hypothetical scenario of retributive harassment while controlling for confounding external variables . A 4 √ó 2 between - subjects experiment tested the effects of interface cues ( only Likes as a control condition vs . high Dislikes vs . low Dislikes vs . a flag ) and harassment severity ( low vs . high ) on participants‚Äô perceptions of online retributive harassment . Our university institutional review board approved this study . We recruited a total of 255 participants via Prolific ( prolific . co ) , an online research subject pool that enables the sampling of diverse populations for experimental studies . Participants were current U . S . residents ages 18 or older and received $ 1 . 27 as compensation for their time based on a $ 9 . 52 hourly minimum wage as was recommended by Prolific . No demographic information such as gender , race , or age was collected as part of the research because our focus was on a psychological characteristic ( i . e . , punishment orientation ) that is not necessarily tied to demographics [ 11 ] . Thirteen participants either chose the same option for the majority of questions or did not give permission to use their data for research purposes . Thus , we had a final sample size of 242 . 3 . 2 Stimuli We developed a total of eight treatments with the stimulus combinations of interface cues ( only Likes as a control condition vs . high Dislikes vs . low Dislikes vs . a flag ) and harassment severity ( low vs . high ) . Participants were randomly assigned to one of the treatments by Qualtrics . Table 1 shows the number of participants assigned to each treatment . Participants observed a hypothetical case of retributive harassment in which a social media user ( Sarah ) , who committed a drunk driving homicide , was being ‚Äúflamed‚Äù ( harassed and insulted ) by another user ( Amy ) . Participants were repeatedly reminded of the following in the experiment : Amy learns that Sarah was found guilty of killing an elderly man in a drunk driving hit - and - run incident . We chose a case of drunk driving homicide because it is an egregious crime yet controversial in that one could still maintain empathy for the offender . In some parts of the United States , killing someone while driving under the influence is legally and socially deemed an unintentional crime [ 3 ] . We chose names that tend to be read as white and female for both the harasser ( Amy ) and the target ( Sarah ) because prior research has shown that this helps control for the confounding effects of racism and sexism [ 6 ] . The harassment post was designed to resemble a Twitter posting where the harasser directly mentioned the offender regardless of their personal relationship . However , we did not specify the social media platform as Twitter in the experiment instruction so as to incorporate newly designed Dislikes and flags while leaving out the share or follow button . We used commonly found phrases in Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 6 , No . CSCW2 , Article 334 . Publication date : November 2022 . 334 : 8 Song Mi Lee , Andrea K .

[ 6 ] for high - severity harassment . To test the contrasting effect of the number of Likes and Dislikes , we used 1 : 8 ratios between Likes and Dislikes ( and vice versa ) to produce a ‚Äúcredible and serious sense of group contradiction‚Äù [ 2 ] . The flag specifically stated that the social media post has been reported for harassment to reduce ambiguity , as Bhandari et al . [ 4 ] did in their experiment with flagged posts ( Figure 1 ) . We did not add icons or colors to Likes and Dislikes to avoid their potential confounding effects . 3 . 3 Procedure This experiment was administered online via Qualtrics and consisted of two sections : ( 1 ) personal characteristics regarding social media engagement and punishment orientation and ( 2 ) response to the retributive harassment stimuli in the randomly assigned treatment . Participants were shown a content warning about the offensive language prior to the experiment . They were asked to give consent to participate and to permit the recording of their responses after being debriefed . The 75 % quartile respondent completed the experiment in 7 . 35 minutes . 3 . 4 Measurements 3 . 4 . 1 Dependent Variables : Harassment Perceptions and Likelihood to Intervene . Participants rated how appropriate , deserved , and justified the retributive harassment ( phrased in the items as ‚Äúwhat Amy [ the poster ] said to Sarah‚Äù ) was on separate 7 - point ordered response scales ( e . g . , 1 = absolutely inappropriate , 7 = absolutely appropriate ) . They additionally rated how much they agreed with the harasser and how happy and offended they were to see the harassment . Participants further gauged whether they were likely to Like , Dislike , flag , or comment on the harassment ( 1 = very unlikely , 7 = very likely ) and , optionally , what the comment would be . We also measured the participants‚Äô perceived likelihood of calling out either the harasser ( Amy ) or the target ( Sarah ) on social media . Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 6 , No .

The Use of Negative Interface Cues to Change Perceptions of Online Retributive Harassment 334 : 9 Of course , intention to do something in the future is not the same as actual future behavior , but these measures do act as a proxy for attitudes if not a direct measure of actual future activity . 3 . 4 . 2 Moderating Variable : Punishment Orientation ( PO ) . Participants responded to questions gauging their subjective beliefs about punishment and retributive justice . This measurement preceded the interaction with the experiment stimuli . Previous research found that general beliefs about justice and punishment and judgments about individual cases are distinct [ 11 ] , which suggests little priming effect in either order . Following Blackwell et al . [ 6 ] , we used the Harsh Retributivism Subscale ( HRS ) of Punishment Orientation Questionnaire devised by Yamamoto [ 76 ] . The HRS is an 8 - item questionnaire that measures agreement to statements such as : ‚ÄúCriminals deserve to be publicly identified and shamed‚Äù and ‚ÄúCriminals are bad people and deserve punishment . ‚Äù The responses were recorded on a 7 - point ordered response scale ( 1 = strongly disagree , 7 = strongly agree ) . We used the mean score of the responses on the HRS scale , ranging from 1 ( low PO ) to 7 ( high PO ) , in the data analysis . 3 . 4 . 3 Social Media Engagement . The survey also asked participants about their general tendencies to Like , Dislike , flag , and comment on social media ; how their feelings are affected by Likes , Dislikes , and comments by other people ; and how they typically respond if witnessing someone else being harassed on social media . The first two sets of questions are comparable to social media participation and consumption , respectively , and we considered the aggregate of both to measure general social media engagement [ 41 ] . 3 . 5 Data Analysis We employed the R statistical packages for analysis , using the significance level of . 05 for all statistical tests . To test H1 ‚Äì H3 , we employed weighted least squares regression models to adjust for non - constant variances between our experimental conditions , and ùêπ tests and Tukey post hoc comparisons to report the result . We used the analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) test because we wanted to make comparisons between categorical variables ( our conditions ) using the variance in our dependent measures , which were aggregated scales . Tukey post hoc comparisons then allowed us to look at the specific differences between each of those groups and to compare means and variances between our conditions . The independent variables were interface cues and harassment severity , and the dependent variables were bystanders‚Äô perceived appropriateness , deservedness , and justifiability of retributive harassment . H4 tested PO as a moderating variable by introducing three two - way interaction terms ( cue √ó severity , cue √ó PO , severity √ó PO ) and one three - way interaction term ( cue √ó severity √ó PO ) in the regression model . To answer RQ1 , we used a separate linear regression modeling with Akaike‚Äôs Information Criteria ( AIC ) to identify which of our measurements effectively predicted the likelihood to intervene in retributive harassment . We found no evidence of multicollinearity in our models ( all variance inflation factors [ VIF ] were < 3 ) . 4 RESULTS Section 4 . 1 describes the participant characteristics . Section 4 . 2 discusses the findings regarding the effects of interface cues and harassment severity on perceived appropriateness , deservedness , and justifiability of retributive harassment ( H1 , H2 , H3 ) . We found some potentially mitigating effects of high Dislikes but aggravating effects of low Dislikes and no significant effects of a flag . Section 4 . 3 reports significant moderating effects of bystanders‚Äô PO on retributive harassment perceptions ( H4 ) . In Section 4 . 4 , we identify what subjective factors motivate participants to intervene in retributive harassment ( RQ1 ) . Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 6 , No .

Thomer , and Cliff Lampe 4 . 1 Participant Characteristics 4 . 1 . 1 Ambivalent Reaction to the Experiment Stimuli . In the manipulation check , all 242 participants confirmed seeing the interface cues , and more than 71 % accurately recalled the cues ( the number of Likes and Dislikes , a flag ) they were shown . An inaccurate recollection by the remainder is plausible given that users in a real social media context might not pay full attention to the details of a post [ 39 ] . Regarding the original violation ( Sarah‚Äôs drunk - driving homicide ) that triggered retributive harassment , 49 % of participants found it unforgivable , 33 % forgivable , and 18 % neutral ( ùëÄ = 3 . 67 , ùëÜùê∑ = 1 . 58 ) . With regard to the retributive harassment ( Amy‚Äôs social media post , either in low severity or high severity ) , 78 % regarded it as harassment , 39 % as punishment , and 8 % as both harassment and punishment . These reactions aligned with our experimental design , which established both the original violation and retributive harassment as controversial to observe whether cues are determining factors of harassment perceptions . 4 . 1 . 2 Moderate Social Media Engagement . In general , participants reported that they were likely to click the Like button ( ùëÄ = 4 . 83 , ùëÜùê∑ = 1 . 62 ) and be affected by other users‚Äô comments ( ùëÄ = 4 . 20 , ùëÜùê∑ = 1 . 71 ) . Disliking ( ùëÄ = 3 . 07 , ùëÜùê∑ = 1 . 68 ) and flagging ( ùëÄ = 3 . 11 , ùëÜùê∑ = 1 . 68 ) were less common , which could be more from the lack of Dislike options in many social media platforms rather than personal preference . The most common response when witnessing online harassment was ignoring ( 29 . 3 % ) followed by flagging ( 28 . 5 % ) , writing a comment ( 15 . 3 % ) , and Liking or Disliking ( 14 . 0 % ) . A small minority ( 2 . 1 % ) said they would share the post to draw others‚Äô attention to it . Some participants ( 10 . 7 % ) said they had not witnessed someone being harassed online . 4 . 1 . 3 Retributive Punishment Orientation . The majority of participants preferred moderate or retributive responses to wrongs , which matches the general population‚Äôs retributive propensity [ 10 ] . Participants‚Äô mean PO was 4 . 48 , which demonstrated a negatively skewed distribution ( median [ ùêºùëÑùëÖ ] = 4 . 62 [ 3 . 88 ‚Äì 5 . 25 ] ) . Overall , our dataset did not have abnormal trends in terms of social media engagement or justice beliefs . 4 . 2 Interactions of Interface Cues and Harassment Severity ( H1 , H2 , H3 ) We found significant interaction between interface cues and harassment severity on bystanders‚Äô perceptions of retributive harassment : perceived appropriateness ( ùêπ [ 3 , 234 ] = 3 . 135 , ùëù = . 026 ) ; deservedness ( ùêπ [ 3 , 234 ] = 13 . 000 , ùëù = . 000 ) ; justifiability ( ùêπ [ 3 , 234 ] = 9 . 232 , ùëù = . 000 ) . This supports our interaction effect assumptions ( i . e . , more significant effects in higher - severity harassment ) in H1 ‚Äì H3 . Accordingly , we interpreted the effect of interface cues at each level of harassment severity .

The coefficients and standard errors of the regression models are included in Appendix A1 . To test our hypotheses , we used Tukey post hoc comparisons to show what differences Dislikes and a flag made from the baseline control condition showing only Likes ( Table 3 ) . 4 . 2 . 1 High Dislikes Reduces Perceived Deservedness and Justifiability ( H1 Partially Supported ) . We hypothesized that high Dislikes reduces perceived appropriateness ( H1a ) , deservedness ( H1b ) , and justifiability ( H1c ) of retributive harassment . H1b and H1c were supported only in the high - severity harassment condition . As shown in Table 3 , when highly severe retributive harassment had more Dislikes than Likes , participants perceived it to be less deserved ( ‚àí . 835 point , ùëÜùê∏ = . 209 , ùëù = . 000 ) and less justified ( ‚àí . 544 point , ùëÜùê∏ = . 176 , ùëù = . 002 ) compared to when the post had Likes only . Perceived appropriateness seemed to decrease ( ‚àí . 179 point , ùëÜùê∏ = . 093 ) but not significantly ( ùëù = . 057 ) . 4 . 2 . 2 Low Dislikes Potentially Exacerbates Retributive Harassment Perceptions ( H2 Unsupported ) . We hypothesized that low Dislikes reduces perceived appropriateness ( H2a ) , deservedness ( H2b ) , and justifiability ( H2c ) of retributive harassment . H2 was rejected at both harassment severity levels . Participants found highly severe harassment more appropriate ( . 493 point , ùëÜùê∏ = . 131 , ùëù = . 000 ) and more justified ( . 504 point , ùëÜùê∏ = . 176 , ùëù = . 006 ) and mildly severe harassment more deserved ( . 733 point , ùëÜùê∏ = . 131 , ùëù = . 000 ) when seeing less Dislikes than Likes compared to only seeing Likes ( Table 3 ) . This result contradicts the negativity effect in that a smaller number of Dislikes than Likes failed to form negative impressions of the accompanying harassment . The presence of many Likes seems to have signaled that retributive harassment is socially acceptable , which can potentially lead to increased support and escalation of the harassment . Proc .

Significant three - way interaction effects among interface cues , harassment severity , and punishment orientation on retributive harassment perceptions . 4 . 2 . 3 A Flag Has No Effect on Retributive Harassment Perceptions ( H3 Unsupported ) . We hypothe - sized that a flag reduces perceived appropriateness ( H3a ) , deservedness ( H3b ) , and justifiability ( H3c ) of retributive harassment . H3 was rejected at both harassment severity levels . In fact , the flag did not yield any statistically significant effect across all treatments ( Table 3 ) . 4 . 3 Punishment Orientation Moderates Retributive Harassment Perceptions ( H4 Supported ) We hypothesized that bystanders‚Äô punishment orientation moderates the interaction effects of interface cues and harassment severity ( H4 ) . H4 was supported . The coefficients and standard errors of the regression models are included in Appendix A2 . Overall , adding the PO variable significantly increased the explanatory power of the regression models predicting perceived appropriateness ( Œî ùëÖ 2 adjusted = . 201 ) , deservedness ( Œî ùëÖ 2 adjusted = . 698 ) , and justifiability ( Œî ùëÖ 2 adjusted = . 617 ) of retributive harassment . PO‚Äôs significant influence was evident when comparing the effect sizes of the variables ( Table 4 ) . Perceived appropriateness was mostly determined by PO ( ùúÇ 2 = . 344 ) and interface cues ( ùúÇ 2 = . 333 ) , followed by harassment severity ( ùúÇ 2 = . 173 ) . For deservedness , interface cues had the largest effect size ( ùúÇ 2 = . 445 ) , followed by PO ( ùúÇ 2 = . 274 ) . Similarly , for justifiability , interface cues had the largest effect size ( ùúÇ 2 = . 659 ) , followed by PO ( ùúÇ 2 = . 209 ) . Participants‚Äô mean PO was 4 . 48 within the range from 1 ( low ) to 7 ( high ) on the HRS scale . Participants who fell below that average were categorized as low PO and those above as high PO . We conducted Tukey post hoc comparisons of interface cues and harassment severity at each level of PO . Table 5 containing the result shows that the effects of interface cues differed across severity levels and across different PO levels . Overall , high Dislikes had significant mitigating effects for low - PO participants at both severity levels . High Dislikes also tended to decrease high - PO participants‚Äô perceived appropriateness , deservedness , and justifiability , but not statistically significantly , which requires further investigation . The presence of low Dislikes was effective for low - PO participants only in high - severity harassment but backfired significantly for high - PO participants . A flag showed more mixed results . For low - PO participants , a flag had some mitigating effects in high - severity harassment but not in low - severity harassment and vice versa for high - PO participants . Proc .

Mitigating effects reduced approval of the harassment , and aggravating effects increased approval of the harassment . 4 . 4 Likelihood to Intervene in Retributive Harassment ( RQ1 ) We investigated subjective factors ( perceptions , intentions , emotions ) that could influence people‚Äôs likelihood to intervene in online retributive harassment by Liking , Disliking , flagging , or com - menting on the harassment post ( RQ1 ) . Using all measurements obtained from the experiment as independent variables , we fitted a new series of linear regression models modeling the perceived likelihood of intervention as the dependent variable . We then excluded independent variables that did not improve the model fit using AIC . Table 6 shows the resulting models . Perceived justifiability was a significant predictor for all models of potential bystander inter - vention . Because perceived justifiability was more determined by interface cues than harassment severity and PO , this result underscores the importance of cues in potential bystander intervention . The likelihood to Like retributive harassment indicates bystanders‚Äô potential support for the harassment . Participants tended to Like the harassment when they saw it as appropriate and justified , and were happy but also somewhat offended to see the harassment . Feeling offended can be caused by the harsh language used in the harassment but it does not seem to necessarily stop people from approving of the harassment . General social media engagement ( participation via Liking , Disliking , flagging , and commenting plus caring about others‚Äô reactions ) and an intention to call out the target ( Sarah ) also increased the likelihood to Like the harassment . Potential benign bystander interventions were captured by the likelihood to Dislike and flag the harassment , both of which showed similar patterns . People who saw the harassment as less justified , felt more offended , and had the intention to call out the harasser ( Amy ) were more likely to Dislike or flag the harassment . Social media participation ( general social media engagement minus caring about others‚Äô reactions ) also increased the likelihood to Dislike the harassment . The likelihood of participants commenting on the harassment was influenced by both the intention to call out the harasser ( Amy ) and to call out the target ( Sarah ) . Among a total of 25 comments submitted by participants , 15 comments ( 60 % ) were negative toward the harassment and included hostile backlashes ( e . g . , ‚ÄúYou [ the harasser ] are ugly on the inside‚Äù ) . Some replicated the derogatory language even when the overall intention was to deter harassment ( e . g . , ‚ÄúI would Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 6 , No . CSCW2 , Article 334 .

But I think telling her that she should kill herself is kind of a harsh statement‚Äù ) . 5 DISCUSSION In this study , we examined whether negative interface cues that signal social norms against retributive harassment tend to change bystanders‚Äô perceptions accordingly . Table 7 summarizes our results . In sum , Dislikes that outnumbered Likes were effective against highly severe retributive harassment . However , when outnumbered by Likes , Dislikes backfired and made low - severity harassment look more deserved and high - severity harassment more appropriate and justified . This tendency was particularly notable for highly punitive people . A flag had no overall significant impact on harassment perceptions , likely because it had confounding effects on people with different punishment orientations in different levels of harassment severity . For less punitive people , a flag was aggravating in low - severity harassment but mitigating in high - severity harassment . For more punitive people , it was mitigating in low - severity harassment but aggravating in high - severity harassment . 5 . 1 Alternative Theories Might Explain Limitations of Negative Interface Cues We found that the negativity effect alone does not explain bystanders‚Äô reactions to online retributive harassment . Rather , our results showed that the negativity effect is substantially limited by the interactive effects of harassment severity and individuals‚Äô punishment orientation . Our results Proc .

Summary of results : bystanders‚Äô perceptions of online retributive harassment . might demonstrate the blemishing effect [ 24 ] rather than the negativity effect and provide support for warranting theory [ 71 , 73 ] . Ein - Gar , Shiv , and Tormala [ 24 ] argued that the negativity effect can be moderated by presenta - tion order ( i . e . , primacy effect ) and information processing effort . They introduced the concept of blemishing effect , whereby additional weak negative information can paradoxically bolster initial favorable impressions formed by positive information . In their theory , encountering minor con - flicting negative information ( e . g . , low Dislikes , a flag ) makes one pause and revisit the positive information they first saw ( e . g . , Likes ) . This refocus on earlier positive information might enhance its salience and appeal . When people‚Äôs cognitive capacity to process more information and change their attitude is low ( e . g . , punishment orientation ) , such enhanced positive information leads to more favorable impressions ( e . g . , more appropriate , more deserved , more justified ) than when they see positive information alone . This might not be the case when the additional negative information is stronger or greater than positive information ( e . g . , high Dislikes ) . Our findings , which show the potential of high Dislikes and the limited effects of low Dislikes and a flag in reducing favorable impressions of retributive harassment , seem to provide supportive evidence of the blemishing effect . Warranting theory [ 71 , 73 ] might also help contextualize our results . The warranting theory describes impression formation in the mediated online environment . It proposes that one‚Äôs percep - tions about a person rely more heavily on hard - to - manipulate cues ( e . g . , others‚Äô appraisals , system information ) than cues that can be manipulated by the person ( e . g . , self - descriptions ) . The former holds greater warranting value than the latter . While warranting theory has been mostly associated with identity cues , our study suggests it can be further applied to explaining different cues for social Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 6 , No . CSCW2 , Article 334 . Publication date : November 2022 . 334 : 16 Song Mi Lee , Andrea K . Thomer , and Cliff Lampe norms . In this case , the cues were not being used to form an interpersonal impression but rather to assess the appropriateness of content . In both cases , cues help navigate ambiguous situations where channel limitations can add to confusion . In our experimental treatment , we presented both Likes and a flag together in retributive harass - ment posts . Interpreted through the lens of warranting theory , we posit that Likes have a higher warranting value than a flag . This is because Likes represent unmediated counts of people who clicked on the Like button presumably to show approval of the harassment , whereas a flag is much more opaque in terms of how or by whom it is generated [ 18 ] . A flag could have been generated by one or more other users , a human moderator , AI [ 4 ] , or even the target of retributive harassment . The target could have flagged the content as harassment ( self - description ) , but the target has no control over the number of Likes ( others‚Äô appraisal ) . Such unresolved uncertainty might result in a flag having less warranting value than Likes as a cue for descriptive norms , even in the case of detrimental retributive harassment . 5 . 2 Harassment Mitigation Needs to Diversify Current moderation practices that heavily rely on automated natural language processing [ 7 ] lack consideration for the psychosocial characteristics of both the harasser and bystanders , which can bring unintended ramifications . Some might think retributive harassment can be banned and shut off like other types of harassment or trolling . However , given the strong moral outrage and justice beliefs behind it , a simplistic ban of retributive harassment could be perceived as an injustice or a platform‚Äôs failure to see its legitimacy [ 28 ] and aggravate public frustration . Moreover , such a ban would leave little room for open public discourse about justice and social norms , especially for counterpublics consisting of marginalized groups [ 25 , 57 , 70 ] . Social media has newly opened a public sphere where people are empowered to participate in debates around injustice , justice beliefs , and norms [ 30 ] . Public disputes about what is acceptable or not are inevitable but essential , because searching for conflict resolution fosters new perspectives within a community [ 5 , 28 ] . Social media platforms , as ‚Äúkeepers of the public discourse‚Äù [ 18 ] , should be cautious about how they might obscure the articulation of concerns and controversies around justice and norms . Therefore , moderating retributive harassment that is pertinent to perceived norms and norm violations demands extra deliberation . 5 . 2 . 1 Dislikes Might Reduce Approval of Retributive Harassment . Our findings show that a high number of Dislikes can overshadow Likes and reduce perceived deservedness and justifiability of severe retributive harassment , especially for less punitive people . Considering that less perceived justifiability led to more likelihood to intervene in harassment via Disliking or flagging , we suggest that a Dislike feature is a potential ‚Äúsimple and indirect intervention‚Äù [ 6 ] against harassment . Social media users and researchers have debated the value of Dislike features for years , but not many major platforms have implemented them [ 75 ] because they can be abused for harassment . For instance , in 2014 , Facebook‚Äôs chief executive officer , Mark Zuckerberg , said he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want a Dislike button to become a way for users to shame others on the site‚Äù [ 17 ] . Others have argued that social media platforms might be against a Dislike feature largely because it is unattractive to advertisers , whose brand might be publicly Disliked [ 27 ] . Amid the controversies , our study suggests that a Dislike feature could be used to counter harassment . As Blackwell et al . [ 7 ] maintained , ‚Äúwhere harassment is visible‚Äîand any sanctioning of that harassment is not‚Äîthen the descriptive norm could easily become that harassment is an appropriate activity . ‚Äù Dislikes might serve as publicly visible sanctions of harassment by social media users . However , in our experiment , low Dislikes ( 5 , 902 Likes versus 689 Dislikes ; roughly an 8 : 1 ratio ) did not achieve a desirable effect on bystander perceptions . When can Dislikes be outnumbered Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 6 , No . CSCW2 , Article 334 . Publication date : November 2022 . The Use of Negative Interface Cues to Change Perceptions of Online Retributive Harassment 334 : 17 by Likes , as in many real - world cases , but still have a desirable effect ? Cheng et al . [ 15 ] hinted that users are most influenced by the proportion of upvotes or downvotes out of the total number of votes . Future research is needed to test more varied numerical proportions such as an equal number or smaller differences as in 2 : 1 or 3 : 1 to find out the critical threshold of Dislikes . While Dislikes might be useful signals , other research has shown that it can be hard to elicit Dislikes [ 65 ] . One solution might be to highlight the Dislike button or the number of Dislikes on many Liked yet abusive social media posts , with a message stating the possibility of retributive harassment . Such nudging toward Disliking has a prosocial goal of decreasing online toxicity . Also , transparency around how the platform views harassment would be more helpful than not [ 35 ] . Recently , Twitter‚Äôs product lead announced its exploration of adding a Dislike feature [ 51 ] . In support of Twitter‚Äôs investigation , we argue that such platforms move beyond the presumptive binary of ‚Äúprosocial‚Äù Likes and ‚Äúantisocial‚Äù Dislikes and look for possibilities to leverage the Dislike feature for prosocial purposes . 5 . 2 . 2 A Flag‚Äôs Mixed Effect Highlights the Importance of Individuals‚Äô Psychosocial Characteristics . Flags have been proposed as an effective measure to deter harassment because they indicate the platform‚Äôs intervention and policy enforcement [ 38 ] . Our findings , however , did not show that flags were an effective signal . Overall , in the presence of Likes , a flag did not significantly decrease the perceived appropriateness , deservedness , or justifiability of retributive harassment . When presented with Likes , a flag was effective for less punitive people in high - severity harassment and for more punitive people in low - severity harassment . In contrast , it backfired for less punitive people in low - severity harassment and for more punitive people in high - severity harassment . In other words , individuals‚Äô psychosocial characteristics such as punishment orientation confounded the effects of a flag . This finding casts doubt on social media platforms‚Äô ( over ) reliance on flags , which often involves ambiguous and opaque decisions of content removal [ 18 ] . Crawford and Gillespie [ 18 ] suggested that platforms offer a space of ‚Äúmultiple constituencies honoring different moral sources‚Äù where people with different perspectives and preferences can make objections and counter - objections around controversial content . We further caution against platforms‚Äô one - size - fits - all content moderation approach . Schoenebeck , Haimson , and Nakamura [ 58 ] found that harassment targets‚Äô preferences for a platform‚Äôs response to harassment ( e . g . , apology , offender list , payment ) differ based on their characteristics such as gender , political orientation , age , and justice beliefs . In line with their work , we underscore the importance of understanding bystanders‚Äô heterogeneous psychosocial characteristics to elicit benign bystander interventions . In - depth research is needed to explicate how people‚Äôs diverse psychosocial characteristics interactively shape perceptions of interface cues and harassment . 5 . 3 Limitations and Future Work As with any experimental work , there are limitations imposed by the method . In particular , ex - perimental work is affected by the validity of the different operationalizations in its composition . A scenario study using screenshots might have limited external validity because it cannot mimic the actual social media context . For instance , the stimuli do not account for users who scroll through many posts , have live interactions with the posts , or have personal relationships with the harasser , target , or other bystanders [ 39 , 65 ] . Personal networks of people are different from stranger networks , and this can drastically change how norms are experienced . However , our scenarios highlighted particular facets of online retributive harassment ( the target‚Äôs violation , harassment , and interface cues ) and avoided the complexities of the real accounts that lead to many uncontrolled inferences [ 11 ] . Proc . ACM Hum . - Comput . Interact . , Vol . 6 , No . CSCW2 , Article 334 . Publication date : November 2022 . 334 : 18 Song Mi Lee , Andrea K . Thomer , and Cliff Lampe Additionally , the different interface cues we introduced could have issues of validity that would affect our findings . How the Dislikes were displayed , how the wording was chosen , the visibility of the flagged content and its Likes , and every other design choice could affect the validity of the experiment . For instance , we assigned a large number of Likes and Dislikes to retributive harassment , but leaving aside the rarity of Dislikes on social media platforms , it is possible that social media users do not often see such big numbers with outright harassment . Highly severe retributive harassment might be removed by platform moderators early on before reaching a wider audience . Future work could iterate on ecologically valid prompts . Future work could further test the hypotheses with different types of violations including misdemeanors ( e . g . , animal neglect or vandalism ) , felonies ( e . g . , kidnapping or sexual assault ) , and social wrongdoings ( e . g . , racism , sexism , or classism ) as well as different types of harassment ( e . g . , doxxing or sexual harassment ) . Such extension might also require or benefit from public surveys of violations and online harassment types in terms of perceived severity . In addition , this study did not account for participants‚Äô demographic characteristics , depending instead on random assignment . Considering that harassment can be more oppressive and damaging for marginalized populations including women , LGBTQ communities , people of color , and racial minority groups [ 6 , 36 ] and that women are more likely to notice and intervene in harassment incidents [ 4 ] , future research should examine the influence of demographic factors in the approval of retributive harassment . 6 CONCLUSION This research describes how interface cues can be used to signal norms of online retributive harassment . We showed that bystanders make judgments depending on the severity of harassment , descriptive norms indicated by interface cues , and their own punishment orientation . A high number of Dislikes might reduce favorable perceptions of retributive harassment , whereas a flag has mixed results . This research contributes to theories of online harassment and interface cues by adding empirical evidence of retributive harassment and bridging the theoretical frameworks of the negativity effect , blemishing effect , and warranting theory . It also suggests practical implications for design intervention that consider people‚Äôs psychosocial variations in responding to harassment . Nudging through interface cues and addressing users‚Äô psychosocial needs are promising directions for mitigating harassment that are both responsive and work at scale .
