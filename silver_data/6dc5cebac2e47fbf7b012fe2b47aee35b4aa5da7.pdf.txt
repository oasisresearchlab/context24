Before filament formation , ATP occupies the nucleotide - binding site of globular actin ( G - actin ) . After filament polymer - ization , the nucleotide - hydrolysis rate of the protein significantly increases 1 , 2 . Owing to a delay between hydrolysis and phosphate release , F - actin passes through at least three conformational stages that are connected to three different nucleotide states : the initial ATP state , the intermediate ADP – P i state and the final ADP state 3 . Whereas hydrolysis and P i release are both first - order processes , the large difference in their kinetic constants results in a characteristic gradient along the filaments , which marks the local age of the poly - mer , thereby essentially acting as a ‘molecular clock’ . Actin - binding proteins specifically sense the nucleotide state of F - actin and use it as a local age tag 4 . This specific readout of filament age is key for the active remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton , a process par - ticularly dependent on the ability of actin - binding proteins , such as cofilin 5 , 6 and coronin 7 , to recognize nucleotide - dependent differ - ences in F - actin . This process ultimately leads to the depolymeriza - tion of old filament regions to be reincorporated at the growing end . This elegant but simple mechanism is key for essential processes such as cellular migration 8 . In addition , the nucleotide state of actin also affects the organization of the actin cytoskeleton . For instance , the actin - homolog - containing Arp2 / 3 complex acts as a seed for a branch point for actin filaments . Phosphate release from F - actin decreases the affinity of the Arp2 / 3 complex for the filaments and consequently results in debranching of the actin cytoskeleton 9 . The nucleotide - binding pocket of the actin molecule is local - ized at the core of the monomer , far from the filament’s surface . Therefore , it has been long recognized that nucleotide hydrolysis and phosphate release must trigger a conformational change at the surface of the protein . A large collection of crystal structures of G - actin in different nucleotide states has shown that several regions of the protein , including the D loop ( residues 39 – 53 ) and W loop ( residues 165 – 172 ) , experience small but important changes related to the nucleotide bound at the active site 10 . Biochemical data sug - gest that the interface between the D loop and the C - terminal tail directly respond to the nucleotide state of the filament , thus indicat - ing that this region is highly variable , with many possible conforma - tions present 11 . The lack of structural data , however , has hindered complete understanding of the nucleotide effects on F - actin ; conse - quently , the exact nature of the conformational changes in the fila - ment , as well as how actin - binding proteins read them , is still largely unknown . Here , we report six near - atomic - resolution structures of F - actin trapped in different nucleotide states , solved by cryo - EM by using different nucleotide analogs or small molecules . Results Two conformations characterize the triphosphate state . The ATP state of F - actin is short lived . Therefore , nonhydrolyzable analogs or other chemicals must be used to trap F - actin in this state . F - actin cannot hydrolyze the ATP analog AppNHp 12 , which has been used in studies of crystallization of G - actin 13 and F - actin polymeriza - tion 12 , 14 and has been found to have indistinguishable kinetics from that of ATP actin 15 . Beryllium fluoride ( BeF x ) is widely used as a P i analog . BeF x together with ADP has also been suggested to mimic the transition state of the hydrolysis reaction of F - actin , which should be very similar to the ATP state 3 . For instance , in the case of myosin , crystal structures of the motor domain with ADP – BeF x and other nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analogs including AppNHp yield almost identical structures 16 , 17 . To understand the ATP state of F - actin in atomic detail , we used cryo - EM and a modified single - particle approach for helical filaments ( Methods and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) to obtain structures Structural transitions of F - actin upon ATP hydrolysis at near - atomic resolution revealed by cryo - EM Felipe Merino 1 , 4 , Sabrina Pospich 1 , 4 , Johanna Funk 2 , Thorsten Wagner 1 , Florian Küllmer 3 , Hans - Dieter Arndt 3 , Peter Bieling 2 and Stefan Raunser 1 * The function of actin is coupled to the nucleotide bound to its active site . ATP hydrolysis is activated during polymerization ; a delay between hydrolysis and inorganic phosphate ( P i ) release results in a gradient of ATP , ADP – P i and ADP along actin fila - ments ( F - actin ) . Actin - binding proteins can recognize F - actin’s nucleotide state , using it as a local ‘age’ tag . The underlying mechanism is complex and poorly understood . Here we report six high - resolution cryo - EM structures of F - actin from rabbit skeletal muscle in different nucleotide states . The structures reveal that actin polymerization repositions the proposed cata - lytic base , His161 , closer to the γ - phosphate . Nucleotide hydrolysis and P i release modulate the conformational ensemble at the periphery of the filament , thus resulting in open and closed states , which can be sensed by coronin - 1B . The drug - like toxin jasplakinolide locks F - actin in an open state . Our results demonstrate in detail how ATP hydrolysis links to F - actin’s conforma - tional dynamics and protein interaction .

Articles NATurE STrucTurAl & MOlEculAr BiOlOgy of rabbit skeletal muscle actin filaments in complex with either AppNHp or ADP – BeF x ( Supplementary Video 1 ) . The resolu - tion of the structures was 3 . 6 and 3 . 4 Å , respectively ( Table 1 and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) , thus allowing us to build full atomic models of the filaments ( Supplementary Video 1 and Fig . 1a – c ) . We were able to clearly identify density for AppNHp and ADP – BeF x and the coordinated metal ion ( Fig . 2a , b , Supplementary Video 2 and Supplementary Fig . 3a , b ) . The position of the nucleotide and the rest of the structure are very similar in both reconstructions . In comparison to structures of G - actin bound to ATP and ATP analogs 13 , 18 , our models show that ADP – BeF x and AppNHp are moved slightly outward with respect to the filament axis ( Supplementary Fig . 4 and Supplementary Video 3 ) . In the crystal structure of G - actin in complex with AppNHp 13 , the γ - phosphate forms hydrogen bonds with the backbones of residues Ser14 , Gly158 and Val159 . Our models are consistent with these interactions being preserved in spite of the monomer flattening ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Larger changes can be observed at residues Gln137 and His161 . Gln137 , which forms a hydrogen bond with the water molecule thought to be responsible for the nucleophilic attack on the nucleo - tide 19 ( Fig . 3a ) , is located closer to the γ - phosphate ( Fig . 3b – d and Supplementary Video 3 ) . Interestingly , His161 , which has been proposed to act as the catalytic base that activates the nucleophilic water bound by Gln137 ( ref . 19 ) , turns toward the position of the attacking water ( Fig . 3b – d and Supplementary Video 3 ) . In contrast , Asp154 , which has also been proposed to act as a catalytic base 20 , does not considerably change its position relative to the nucleotide during the G - to - F transition ( Fig . 3b – d ) . We therefore propose that the repositioning of Gln137 and His161 with respect to ATP and Asp154 results in the proper geometry at the active site enabling the acceleration of ATP hydrolysis after actin polymerization . The actin filament can be described as a double - stranded right - handed helix . The structure is stabilized by interactions between subunits of the same strand ( intrastrand interactions ) and across strands ( interstrand interactions ) . At the intrastrand interface of the ADP – BeF x filament , the D loop ( residues Arg39 – Tyr53 ) is bent out - ward with respect to the filament axis , and it forms a hydrophobic cavity that extends to the groove between subdomains SD1 and SD3 of the next actin subunit ( Fig . 1b , Supplementary Video 4 and over - view of actin subdomains in Fig . 1a ) . Phe375 from the C - terminal tail of an adjacent subunit fills this pocket , thus forming a hydro - phobic network that extends to the bottom of SD2 ( Fig . 1b ) . We call this the open - D - loop state . In addition , the reorganization of the D loop creates a tight electrostatic network including residues Arg39 and His40 , and residues His173 and Asp286 from an intrastrand contact , as well as an interstrand interaction with Glu270 ( Fig . 1b ) . Interestingly , an additional weaker density at the intrastrand inter - face of the ADP – BeF x filament is consistent with an alternative conformation similar to the ADP state of the filament ( described below ) ( Supplementary Video 5 ) , which we call the closed - D - loop state . However , the level of fragmentation of this density suggests that the state is rarely populated in ADP – BeF x F - actin . Whereas in the structure of ADP – BeF x , F - actin populates mostly the open - D - loop state , the same regions appear flexible in the F - actin – AppNHp complex . Densities for the D loop and the C ter - minus are visible but appear in two alternative conformations . One conformation coincides with the closed - D - loop state . The other is more similar to the open - D - loop conformation ( Supplementary Video 5 ) . We were not able to separate these conformations through focused classification , thus suggesting that subunits within the fila - ment can adopt the two states independently . When we analyzed the nucleotide content of the filaments , we found that only 81 % of the monomers contained AppNHp . The remaining 19 % were a mixture of ADP and primarily the hydrolysis product of AppNHp ( AppNH 2 ) , which accumulated in the filaments during preparation ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . This result indicates a higher affinity of actin for AppNH 2 and ADP than for AppNHp , in agreement with previ - ous reports 21 . Consequently , determining whether the observed flexibility stems from the mixed nucleotide content of the filaments or is an intrinsic feature of the ATP - like state is difficult . Therefore , AppNHp appears to be a suboptimal ATP analog for F - actin , as has been also shown for the actin - related protein Arp3 ( ref . 22 ) . To understand the effect of ATP hydrolysis on F - actin , we deter - mined the structure of the filament in the ADP – P i state at 3 . 3 - Å res - olution ( Fig . 1d , f , Table 1 , Supplementary Fig . 2 and Supplementary Video 1 ) . The ADP – P i map shows a clear density for P i at the nucleotide - binding pocket ( Fig . 2c , Supplementary Video 2 and Supplementary Fig . 3c ) . A comparison with the AppNHp map shows that this density is separated from that of the α and β phosphates , thus demonstrating that it represents the true ADP – P i state of the fil - ament ( Fig . 2a , c , Supplementary Video 2 and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Moreover , the density appears at the same threshold as ADP , thereby suggesting that the entire filament is in the ADP – P i state . As with the γ - phosphate of AppNHp , P i is mostly bound through interactions with the protein backbone . Likewise , the active site stays in the same configuration ( Fig . 3d ) . Contrary to previous reports of the ADP – P i state at lower resolutions , we did not observe density consistent with additional P i - binding sites 23 . At the intrastrand interface , the D loop is predominantly in the closed conformation , and the last turn of the C - terminal helix is partially unwound ( Fig . 1d , e and Supplementary Video 4 ) . Phe375 is still part of the hydrophobic network formed by the D loop , but it is no longer inserted into the pocket formed by the D loop . Instead , its side chain is pushed toward the N - terminal side of the D loop , where it also interacts with the hydrophobic residues from the β - sheet of SD3 ( Fig . 1e and Supplementary Video 4 ) . Thus , the hydrophobic nature of the interactions is maintained indepen - dently of conformational changes . Inspection of the map at a lower threshold reveals an additional density that corresponds to the open - D - loop conformation ( Supplementary Video 5 ) . Thus , simi - larly to the ATP - like F - actin structures , the open and closed states are populated . However , in the case of ADP – P i , the closed state rep - resents the main conformation . Jasplakinolide locks the open - D - loop conformation . Drug - like toxins are known to modify the dynamics of F - actin . For instance , jasplakinolide ( JASP ) , a natural - product toxin first found in the sponge Jaspis splendens 24 , is known to stabilize actin filaments , to increase their persistence length and to inhibit phosphate release without modifying the polymerization rate 25 , 26 . To understand how JASP affects the filaments , we determined the structure of F - actin polymerized in the presence of ATP and JASP , at 3 . 7 - Å resolu - tion ( Fig . 4a – d , Table 1 , Supplementary Fig . 2 and Supplementary Video 1 ) . We used a synthetic analog of JASP with improved solubility resulting from a cationic lysine side chain and a removed methyl group . Both modifications have been shown to result in compounds with function similar to that of JASP itself 27 – 29 . Similarly to its configuration in the complex between Plasmodium F - actin and JASP 30 , JASP binds to a pocket between SD1 and SD4 from an adjacent protomer , wedging its indole group between the domains ( Fig . 4a , Fig . 2d and Supplementary Video 2 ) . Importantly , JASP does not induce a change in helical symmetry ( Table 1 ) , and ADP is in the same position as the nucleotides in the F - actin – AppNHp , F - actin – ADP – BeF x and F - actin – ADP – P i structures ( Fig . 2a – d , Supplementary Video 2 and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . As a consequence of P i - release inhibition—and although we polymerized the filaments from G - actin – ATP without extra phosphate—a clear but slightly weaker density for P i is visible in the nucleotide - binding pocket ( Fig . 2d , Supplementary Video 2 and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Because the density occupies the same position as P i in ADP – P i F - actin , we conclude that it indeed corresponds to phosphate . In contrast to the structure of the ADP – P i state , the overall structure is similar to the open - D - loop state with an extended C terminus ( Fig . 4c , d and NATuRE STRucTuRAl & MolEculAR Biology | VOL 25 | JUNE 2018 | 528 – 537 | www . nature . com / nsmb 529 © 2018 Nature America Inc . , part of Springer Nature .

Articles NATurE STrucTurAl & MOlEculAr BiOlOgy Supplementary Video 4 ) . This result suggests that JASP locks the con - formational dynamics of the intrastrand interface of the filament . To test whether JASP also stabilizes the open - D - loop state in the absence of P i , we polymerized the filaments directly from G - actin – ADP and JASP ( Methods ) , and solved the structure to 3 . 6 - Å reso - lution ( Table 1 , Supplementary Fig . 2 and Supplementary Video 1 ) . We observed JASP in the same position as that in the F - actin – ADP – P i JASP structure ( Fig . 4a , e , Fig . 2d , e and Supplementary Video 2 ) . The filament again adopts the open - D - loop conformation ( Fig . 4g , h and Supplementary Video 4 ) , even when the density in the binding pocket clearly shows that only ADP is bound to it ( Fig . 2e , Fig . 4f , Supplementary Video 2 and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Thus , the binding of JASP to actin is sufficient to lock F - actin in the open - D - loop state , regardless of the nature of the nucleotide bound to the active site . Phosphate release locks the closed conformation . To study the conformational changes induced by the release of P i , we solved the structure of F - actin in complex with ADP , to 4 . 1 - Å resolution ( Fig . 1g – i , Table 1 , Supplementary Fig . 2 and Supplementary Video 1 ) . In contrast to a previously published reconstruction of F - actin – ADP at lower resolution 31 , the complete structure is resolved , including the metal – nucleotide complex ( Fig . 1i , Fig . 2f , Supplementary Video 2 and Supplementary Fig . 3f ) . The F - actin – ADP structure is very similar to our previously determined F - actin – ADP – tropomyosin structure 32 , 33 ( Supplementary Fig . 6a ) . However , the flexible C terminus of the F - actin – tropomyosin struc - ture is ordered in our F - actin – ADP map ( Supplementary Fig . 6b , c ) . This finding indicates that the binding of tropomyosin to F - actin induces allosteric structural changes in the filament . The D loop is in the closed state while the C terminus forms a complete α - helix ( Fig . 1h and Supplementary Video 4 ) . Importantly , there is no additional density in F - actin – ADP that would corre - spond to the open - D - loop conformation , thus suggesting that phos - phate release locks the interface in the closed state . In addition , the switch region , including His73 , is opened after phosphate release , and the clear density observed for the side chain of His161 is weaker ( Supplementary Video 2 and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Although we cannot rule out that the latter is due to the comparably lower resolu - tion , this result suggests that this amino acid is flexible in the active site of the ADP state . Rotation of SD1 couples the core to the periphery . To better dis - sect the conformational changes transmitting the signal of P i release from the nucleotide - binding pocket to the D loop and C terminus and how they correlate , we performed a principal component analy - sis ( PCA ) of our six structures ( Fig . 5a and Supplementary Video 6 ) . The motion along the first component corresponds to the opening of the nucleotide - binding cleft due to a slight rotation of SD1 , and the ADP state shows the most open binding pocket ( Fig . 5b and Supplementary Video 6 ) . This result suggests that the interactions with the γ - phosphate are key to controlling the opening of SD1 . The opening of SD1 along this component is accompanied by the reorganization of SD2 , including the D - loop region ( Fig . 5b and Supplementary Video 6 ) . These changes in SD2 are responsible for the large reorganization at the intrastrand interface , in which the C terminus folds into an α - helix , and the D loop adopts the closed conformation ( Fig . 5b and Supplementary Videos 6 and 7 ) . Although the ADP – P i and ADP states are very similar along the first component , they can be clearly differentiated along the second ( Fig . 5c and Supplementary Video 6 ) . The difference involves a small rotation of SD1 that results in the opening of the switch region , and the ADP state has the most open conformation .

Articles NATurE STrucTurAl & MOlEculAr BiOlOgy The stability of F - actin is directly dependent on the nucleotide state . Filaments in the ATP or ADP – P i state are thermodynamically and mechanically more stable than F - actin – ADP and have longer persistence lengths 36 , 37 . To understand why , we performed an in silico alanine scan evaluating the energetic contribution of key resi - dues to the filament’s stability ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Interestingly , alanine mutations at the intrastrand interface of F - actin – ADP are predicted to be less destabilizing than those at the same region in the ADP – BeF x filament , thereby explaining the lower stability of the filaments after phosphate release . Thus , in contrast to micro - tubules 38 or the prokaryotic actin homolog ParM 39 , in which the bound nucleotide affects filament symmetry and stability , changes at the D loop / C terminus interface determine the stability of the F - actin filament without altering the helical symmetry ( Table 1 ) . This finding also explains the more moderate nucleotide - dependent effect on F - actin filament stability compared with that on ParM and microtubules , which display dynamic instability . Coronin - 1B senses the intrastrand interface . To further test how actin - binding proteins sense the nucleotide state of the actin fila - ment , we performed total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy to investigate the binding of coronin - 1B to F - actin in different nucleotide states . Coronin - 1B preferentially localizes at the lamellipodium , where it coordinates the effects of Arp2 / 3 and cofilin 7 . In agreement with its cellular localization , coronin - 1B has been reported to bind almost 50 times more strongly to F - actin filaments in the ADP – P i state than the ADP state 4 . In line with this observation , we detected robust binding of coronin - 1B to ADP – P i filaments ( K d 711 ± 111 nM ) , whereas binding to F - actin – ADP was almost undetectable under the experimental conditions ( Fig . 6 ) . Binding of coronin - 1B to AppNHp filaments was diminished , in contrast to the strong binding in the ADP – P i state . However , this observation may be a result of the mixed nucleotide content of our AppNHp sample . Most importantly , polymerization from ADP - bound monomers and JASP resulted in coronin - 1B binding as strong as that to ADP – P i filaments ( K d 707 ± 111 nM ) ( Fig . 6 ) . Atomic models of the F - actin – coronin - 1B complex , which we calculated on the basis of the previously determined subnanome - ter - resolution cryo - EM structure 40 , show that the binding site of coronin - 1B on F - actin encompasses the filament’s intrastrand inter - face ( Supplementary Fig . 8a , b ) . These observations suggest that coronin - 1B directly senses the nucleotide state of the filament via conformational changes at this interface in response to phosphate release , as speculated previ - ously 40 . Moreover , the models show that the coronin - 1B - and JASP - binding sites are far from each other , thus excluding a direct effect of JASP on the binding of coronin - 1B to F - actin ( Supplementary Fig . 8c ) . Considering the rescue effect of JASP , we propose that coronin - 1B uses conformational selection and preferentially binds the open state of the intrastrand interface , which is present in all triphosphate states . Therefore , proteins preferring F - actin – ADP – P i may possibly bind to F - actin – ADP – BeF x more strongly . Discussion Using cryo - EM , we solved the structure of F - actin in all nucleotide states at near - atomic resolution . Our structures show that nucleo - tide hydrolysis , phosphate release and JASP binding have little effect on the overall arrangement of the filaments and cause no changes in helical symmetry ( Table 1 ) . However , we identified key differences providing important insights into the mechanism of nucleotide hydrolysis and filament dynamics . Although the flattening of actin during the G - to - F transition has been known for several years 41 , the changes responsible for the increase in catalytic activity after polym - erization are still not understood . The active site of actin contains several amino acids sensitive to electron radiation 42 , 43 —particularly lysines and acidic residues—and is thus challenging for cryo - EM . Nevertheless , we were able to build a reliable model for most of the side chains ( Supplementary Video 2 and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Our structures show that Gln137 experiences a minor conformational change during the G - to - F transition , whereas Asp154 stays in the same position ( Fig . 3 ) . In contrast , His161 turns toward the nucleo - tide , occupying the position of a water molecule observed in crys - tal structures of G - actin 19 . In a recent theoretical study , McCullagh and colleagues 20 have proposed that a rearrangement of the water network around Asp154 is responsible for the increase in catalytic activity after filament formation . However , they modeled His161 in its G - form conformation , which could have biased their results . Indeed , from the crystal structure of actin from D . discoideum in complex with Li + – ATP , a similar , albeit smaller , rotation of His161 has been proposed to be key for the catalytic activity 19 . Filaments polymerized from ATP – G - actin and JASP show a clear density for P i ( Fig . 2d , Supplementary Fig . 3d and Supplementary Video 2 ) . Owing to the nature of the JASP - binding site , we pro - pose that inhibition of P i release may be a result of two comple - mentary mechanisms . First , the molecule directly interacts with the switch ( residues 70 – 78 ) and proline - rich ( residues 108 – 112 ) loops , both of which are known to be important for phosphate release 23 , 44 ( Fig . 2d and Supplementary Video 2 ) . Second , JASP is deeply wedged between SD1 and SD4 , thus pushing SD1 toward the pointed end , closing the nucleotide - binding pocket and locking the protein in the open state ( Fig . 4a and Supplementary Video 2 ) , which is likely to have a higher affinity for P i . In contrast to the small changes elicited by nucleotides at the active site , the changes at the intrastrand interface are more sub - stantial .

Articles NATurE STrucTurAl & MOlEculAr BiOlOgy with open - and closed - D - loop conformations . In ADP – F - actin , however , the D loop is exclusively in the closed state . The addi - tion of JASP can again change this state to the open - D - loop con - formation , regardless of the nucleotide at the binding site ( Fig . 4 and Supplementary Video 4 ) . The observation that F - actin JASP populates a state normally accessible only when three phosphates are present at the active site is consistent with previous observations showing that the thermodynamic effect of JASP is similar to the effect of P i binding 26 . Interestingly , cross - linking data have suggested that the D loop can populate several conformations , independently of the nucleotide state of the filament 11 . Therefore , open and closed states might always be present , and their relative abundance may be controlled by the identity of the nucleotide at the active site . In agreement with this idea , the order along the first component of our PCA resembles the order of the affinities of the ligands—in which JASP ( ~ 15 nM ( ref . 45 ) ) and BeF x ( ~ 1 – 2 µ M ( ref . 3 ) ) having higher affinities than P i ( ~ 1 . 5 mM ( ref . 45 ) ) ( Fig . 5a ) —with the high - affinity ligands pushing the protein further toward the open state . Although at these resolutions , it is not possible to identify a clear commu - nication pathway leading from the nucleotide - binding pocket to the D loop , the PCA suggests that slight changes in the position of SD1 , due to the nucleotide state , couple both sites ( Fig . 5 and Supplementary Video 6 ) . In particular , we propose that the interac - tion between the protein and the γ - phosphate controls the opening of SD1 , thus ultimately affecting the conformation of the D loop and C - terminal tail . Interestingly , SD1 shows a lower local resolution in all reconstructions , independently of the ligand and the identity of the subunit ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . This finding is consistent with our interpretation of a flexible SD1 rather than a side effect of the reconstruction method . Importantly , because the C terminus and D loop form key interstrand and intrastrand contacts , the confor - mational changes induced by the release of phosphate in one actin subunit can be transmitted to the neighboring ones . Similar coop - erative effects have been described for the actin nucleator mDia1 ; although the protein binds only to the barbed end of F - actin , it can increase the flexibility of the region around the C terminus in the whole filament 46 . Likewise , such cooperativity has previously been assumed when explaining the negative effects of C - terminal actin truncations on polymerization and ATP hydrolysis 47 . Our TIRF microscopy experiments show that JASP can com - pletely compensate for the absence of P i in coronin - 1B binding experiments ( Fig . 6b ) . This result suggests that the binding of this compound can erase the temporal information stored in the fila - ment , thus calling for caution in its usage in labeling actin in cell biology studies . Similarly , the toxin phalloidin competes with JASP for binding to F - actin and elicits similar effects on the filament 45 . However , because myosins V and VI can differentiate between phalloidin - stabilized ADP F - actin and ADP – P i F - actin 48 , the mode of action of JASP and phalloidin cannot be completely analogous . In agreement with this possibility , a recent cryo - EM structure of an actomyosin complex bound to phalloidin has shown that although both toxins share the same binding site , the D loop is still in the closed conformation 49 . Whether this conformation is due to the binding of myosin or to a different mechanism of action must be addressed with a bare actin phalloidin structure . Do other proteins recognize the nucleotide state of actin through the changes at the intrastrand interface ? The cryo - EM structure of the complex between F - actin – ADP and cofilin 50 shows that cofilin induces a rotation of SD1 and SD2 , which may be incompatible with the interactions with the γ - phosphate . The structure also shows that the N - terminal tail of cofilin can insert into the intrastrand inter - face of F - actin ( Supplementary Fig . 8d , e ) . The increased stability of this region in the open - D - loop conformation would block this insertion , thus potentially explaining the lower affinity of cofilin for JASP Indole group SD1 A 0 SD4 A – 1 Q137 Y306 M305 K213 E214 K336 K18 S14 D11 D154 D157 H161 ADP Mg 2 + Pi a b Q137 Y306 M305 K213 E214 K336 K18 S14 D11 D154 D157 H161 ADP Mg 2 + JASP Indole group SD1 A 0 SD4 A – 1 e f E270 R39 D286 H40 H173 L69 I64 Y169 Y53 V43 M44 V139 M355 Y143 P38 L142 V45 M47 F375 V152 V163 c d JASP ( panel A ) A 0 A – 1 A – 2 A + 1 A + 2 A 0 A + 1 A + 2 E270 R39 D286 H40H173 L69 I64 Y169 Y53 V43 M44 V139 M355 Y143 P38 L142 V45 M47 F375 V152V163 g h JASP ( panel E ) A 0 A – 1 A – 2 A + 1 A + 2 A 0 A + 1 A + 2 Fig . 4 | Effect of JASP binding on the structure of F - actin . a , e , Binding of JASP to F - actin , as observed in F - actin – ADP – P i JASP ( a ) and F - actin – ADP JASP ( e ) .

Articles NATurE STrucTurAl & MOlEculAr BiOlOgy F - actin - ADP – P i51 . In agreement with this possibility , removal of the first five residues of cofilin abolishes its filament - severing activity , thereby demonstrating that the interaction with the N - terminal tail is key for its function 52 . We therefore speculate that the N - terminal tail of cofilin is also key for recognizing the nucleotide state of F - actin . Combined with our coronin observations , the data suggest that the nucleotide - driven conformational changes at the intra - strand interface are of general relevance for the nucleotide - state sensing by actin - binding proteins . Thus , we propose that other actin - binding proteins can also sense the conformational balance at the intrastrand interface of F - actin and consequently determine its nucleotide state . Our structural work allowed us to define critical steps in actin polymerization and to suggest the following mechanism ( Fig . 7 ) . G - actin – ATP is incorporated into the growing end of the fila - ment , where His161 rotates to its catalytic position and induces ATP hydrolysis . The D loop can fluctuate between open and closed states . In the open state , it traps the C terminus of the subunit above in an extended conformation .

ATP G - actin adds to the growing ( + ) end of the filament undergoing a conformational change to F - actin - ATP ( 1 ) . The conformational change triggers the reorientation of His161 into its catalytic position promoting hydrolysis ( 2 ) . Before and after hydrolysis , the open - and closed - D - loop states coexist . Although the population of each state is nucleotide dependent , hydrolysis increases the relative population of the closed state ( 3 and 4 ) . After phosphate release ( 5 ) , the filament is locked in the closed - D - loop state , which is accompanied by a helical fold of the C terminus ( 6 ) , thus resulting in destabilization of the filament at the pointed ( – ) end . Addition of JASP during polymerization ( 7 ) locks the conformation of the SD1 / SD4 interface ( 8 ) , thereby inhibiting phosphate release ( 9 ) and trapping the filament in the open - D - loop state with the C - terminal tail extended ( 10 ) . Polymerization from G - actin – ADP ( 11 ) in combination with JASP ( 12 and 13 ) can still trap F - actin in the open - D - loop state ( 14 ) , thus effectively erasing the information about the age of the filament .

Articles NATurE STrucTurAl & MOlEculAr BiOlOgy Methods Rabbit skeletal muscle actin purification and labeling . Actin was purified from acetone powder of rabbit skeletal muscle , as described previously 54 – 57 , with minor modifications . We performed two consecutive polymerization / depolymerization cycles to improve purity . For the polymerization steps , we induced filament formation with 0 . 1 M KCl and 2 mM MgCl 2 . After 1 h at 4 °C , we performed a salt wash by bringing the concentration of KCl to 0 . 8 M and incubated samples for another hour . The standard G - actin buffer contained 5 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM NaN 3 , 0 . 5 mM DTT and 0 . 2 mM ATP . For fluorescence microscopy experiments , we labeled actin at Cys374 with Atto488 - maleimide with the protocols described in ref . 58 . Expression , purification and labeling of human coronin1B - SNAP . Homo sapiens coronin - 1B cloned into a pFastBAC vector with an N - terminal His 6 tag followed by a TEV protease – cleavage site and a C - terminal SNAP tag was expressed in Sf9 cells for 3 d via the Baculovirus Expression system . Sf9 cells were lysed in an Emulsiflex C5 with 50 mM KP i , pH 7 . 5 , 300 mM NaCl , 5 mM β - mercaptoethanol and complete protease - inhibitor cocktail . The high - speed supernatant ( 200 , 000 g , 30 min ) was then circulated over a Ni 2 + – Sepharose Excel column . After the resin was washed with wash buffer ( 50 mM KP i , pH 7 . 5 , 300 mM NaCl and 5 mM β - mercaptoethanol ) , the protein was eluted with a gradient over ten column volumes with wash buffer containing 500 mM imidazole . The protein was dialyzed together with His 6 – TEV protease overnight into low - salt buffer ( 5 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 30 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT and 0 . 1 mM EDTA ) . After dialysis , the protein was recirculated over the Ni 2 + – Sepharose Excel column to remove the protease and uncleaved protein . Then the protein was bound to a MonoQ column and eluted with a gradient over 40 column volumes with high - salt buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 1 M NaCl , 1 mM DTT and 0 . 5 mM EDTA ) . For labeling , 1 mM DTT as well as a twofold molar excess of SNAP - Surface Alexa Fluor 647 ( NEB ) was added to the protein and incubated overnight on ice . After labeling , insoluble protein was removed by centrifugation . The 75 - kDa protein was then gel - filtered over a Superose 6 10 / 300 GL column into storage buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM KCl and 1 mM TCEP ) to separate the labeled coronin1B – SNAP - Surface Alexa Fluor 647 construct from free dye . After gel filtration , the protein was concentrated , supplemented with 20 % glycerol , frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at – 80 °C . The protein concentration ( 20 μ M ) and the degree of labeling ( 68 % ) were determined on the basis of absorbance at 280 and 650 nm , respectively . Preparation and biotinylation of heavy meromyosine . Skeletal muscle myosin was isolated from chicken muscle tissue , as described previously 59 , 60 . Heavy meromyosine was prepared by α - chymotrypsin digestion at RT for 15 min with 25 μ g / ml α - chymotrypsin . The reaction was stopped by addition of 0 . 3 mM PMSF and dialyzed overnight into 10 mM NaP i , pH 7 . 2 , 35 mM NaCl and 10 mM DTT . After high - speed centrifugation at 300 , 000 g for 1 h , the supernatant was dialyzed into 10 mM NaP i , pH 7 . 2 , and 35 mM NaCl . For maleimide labeling , the protein was incubated on ice with a fivefold molar excess of EZ - Link Maleimide - PEG2 - Biotin ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) for 2 h . The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 mM DTT , and the free dye was removed by passage of the protein over a HiPrep 26 / 10 desalting column . The protein was supplemented with 20 % glycerol , frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at – 80 °C . Jasplakinolide - analog synthesis . JASP - cLys ( referred to as JASP ) was synthesized with an extension of the protocol described in ref . 27 . Details of the synthesis protocol and characterization of the compound are available in the Supplementary Note . Sample and grid preparation for cryo - EM . We prescreened and optimized the grid - preparation conditions for all samples on a Tecnai G Spirit microscope ( FEI ) operated at 120 kV , with a single - tilt cryotransfer holder 626 ( Gatan ) . For all samples , we started from frozen aliquots of G - actin . After thawing , we performed a 30 - to 60 - min centrifugation at 100 , 000 g to remove possible aggregates . In all cases , polymerization was induced with 0 . 1 M KCl and 2 mM MgCl 2 , and filaments were collected by centrifugation at 100 , 000 g for 1 to 2 h at 4 °C . For the ADP and ADP – BeF x actin , we supplemented the samples with 0 . 2 mM ATP during the initial polymerization step . Then the filaments were incubated at 4 °C overnight to ensure full ATP hydrolysis . Afterward , filaments were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in F buffer ( 5 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 1 M KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 and 2 mM NaN 3 ) supplemented with 1 mM TCEP and 0 . 2 mM ADP . For the BeF x sample , filaments were incubated with 0 . 2 mM BeF 2 and 5 mM NaF for 1 – 3 h on ice . For the ADP – P i filaments , we supplemented G - actin with 0 . 5 mM ADP and induced polymerization for 2 h at room temperature , then incubated samples overnight at 4 °C . We collected these filaments by centrifugation and resuspended them in a buffer containing 5 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 05 M KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM NaN 3 , 0 . 5 mM TCEP , 0 . 2 mM ADP and 50 mM potassium phosphate , pH 7 . 5 . For the ADP JASP and ADP – P i JASP samples , we performed two consecutive polymerization steps . After an initial step to further purify active actin , filaments were resuspended in G buffer dialyzed against 0 . 5 mM ATP ( ADP – P i JASP ) or ADP ( ADP JASP ) for 2 – 3 d to exchange the nucleotide . Afterward , the filaments were polymerized overnight with a 2 × molar excess of JASP . Finally , F - actin was resuspended in F buffer ( with Tris ) and supplemented with 1 mM DTT . For AppNHp , we used a sequential protocol to exchange the nucleotide in the binding pocket . First , freshly thawed G - actin was dialyzed against G buffer supplemented with 0 . 5 mM DTT but with no nucleotide , at 4 °C . Two dialysis steps , one overnight and one for 4 h , ensured that most of the bound nucleotide was removed from the protein . Then the sample was supplemented with 2 mM AppNHp , and polymerization started . After 2 h at room temperature , filaments were collected by centrifugation , resuspended in G buffer supplemented with 2 mM AppNHp and 0 . 5 mM DTT and left overnight at 4 °C to depolymerize . Afterward , we used a SpinTrap G - 25 ( GE Healthcare ) column to exchange against fresh G buffer and remove possible degraded AppNHp . The resulting G - actin was supplemented with 2 mM AppNHp and polymerized for 1 . 5 h at room temperature . Finally , the filaments were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in F buffer supplemented with 0 . 5 mM TCEP and 0 . 4 mM AppNHp . In all cases , except for F - actin – ADP – P i , we applied 1 . 5 – 1 . 8 µ l of sample onto a freshly glow - discharged holey carbon grid ( C - flats 2 / 1 , Protochips for ADP , R2 / 1 300 mesh Quantifoil for the remaining samples ) . All grids were incubated for 30 – 60 s at > 90 % humidity , then manually blotted for 6 – 11 s from the back side with Whatman no . 5 filter paper . Immediately after blotting , the grids were plunge - frozen in liquid ethane with a Cp3 cryoplunger ( Gatan ) . ADP – P i specimens were prepared by application of 1 . 5 µ l onto a Quantifoil R2 / 1 300 grid . The sample was blotted for 8 s on both sides and plunged with a Vitrobot at 100 % humidity and 13 °C ( 1 - s drain time , – 25 force ) . All samples contained a final F - actin concentration of 0 . 35 – 10 µ M , 0 . 02 – 0 . 04 % ( wt / vol ) Tween - 20 to improve ice quality and saturating concentrations of the corresponding ligands . Cryo - EM data collection . The datasets were collected on a C s - corrected FEI Titan Krios transmission electron microscope equipped with an XFEG at 300 kV with the automated data - collection software EPU ( FEI ) . Images of the AppNHp , ADP – BeF x , ADP and JASP - stabilized ADP – actin complexes were collected with a Falcon II detector . The JASP - stabilized ADP – P i sample was recorded with a GIF quantum - energy filter ( Gatan ) set to a filter width of 15 eV and a K2 Summit detector ( Gatan ) operated in super - resolution mode . Images of F - actin – ADP – P i were collected with a Falcon III detector operated in linear mode . In all cases , we acquired four images per grid hole . Table 1 contains the details on exposure time , frame number and electron dose for all datasets . Cryo - EM image processing . Unaligned frame averages were manually inspected and judged regarding ice and protein quality . After manual removal of bad images , the remaining movie micrographs were motion corrected with either MotionCor2 ( ref . 61 ) or Unblur 62 . During this step , the super - resolution images of the ADP – P i JASP dataset were 2 × binned in Fourier space , thus resulting in a pixel size of 1 . 09 Å . CTF estimation was performed with either GCTF 63 ( ADP JASP and ADP – P i ) or CTFFIND4 ( ref . 64 ) on the full - dose motion - corrected sums . We used an in - house - developed plugin for ImageJ to automatically select filaments from the F - actin – ADP – P i dataset . For the rest of the datasets , filaments were manually selected with sxhelixboxer . py in SPARX 65 and split into overlapping segments . We used a box size of 260 pixels for AppNHp and ADP – BeF x , 288 pixels for ADP – P i JASP and 256 pixels for the remaining datasets . We used a boxing distance of 37 pixels for the JASP - stabilized datasets , 32 pixels for ADP – P i , and 29 pixels for the remaining ones . Segment coordinates were exported , and all further processing steps were performed with Relion 66 . Because we used an automatic particle picker for the ADP – P i dataset , we performed a helical 2D classification in Relion to remove false positives . To further curate the data , we discarded particles coming from micrographs with high drift or few Thon rings before the 3D - refinement step . For 3D refinement , we used a modified single - particle approach that did not use helical - symmetry constraints at any point . A schematic summary of our pipeline is illustrated in Supplementary Fig . 1 . As an initial reference , we created a reference from the known structure of F - actin ( PDB 5JLF ) 32 , 33 with EMAN2 ( ref . 67 ) . For the F - actin – ADP JASP dataset , we used the F - actin – ADP – P i JASP structure as a starting reference . All initial references were low - pass filtered to 20 – 25 Å , to avoid reference bias . For the first rounds of refinement , we used ~ 1 . 3 × - binned particles extracted from aligned and dose - corrected micrographs . Initially , we refined the structure with a restraint search , in which the possible tilt angles were between 90 ± 1° , with a starting sampling rate of 3 . 7° . For the AppNHp , ADP – BeF x and ADP actin filaments , we used a mask for the central nine subunits of the filament . Hereafter , all refinement steps were performed with a soft mask that contained 80 – 85 % of the filament . After the limit tilt search , the resulting map was low - pass filtered to 7 – 8 Å and used as a reference for a local search , without tilt limit , with an angular sampling rate of 0 . 9° . Because of the absence of helical restraints in the refinement , it is possible to identify badly aligned particles , because they deviate from the expected orientation as compared with the rest of the filament . According to this information , we discarded all filaments with more than 20 % badly aligned segments . Similar strategies have been used by other groups to improve the processing of helical polymers 68 . In addition , we calculated a running average of tilt and psi ( in - plane rotation ) angles for all filaments , and used this value for the prior distribution ( _ rlnPsiPrior NATuRE STRucTuRAl & MolEculAR Biology | www . nature . com / nsmb © 2018 Nature America Inc . , part of Springer Nature . All rights reserved . Articles NATurE STrucTurAl & MOlEculAr BiOlOgy and _ rlnTiltPrior ) in the next round of refinement . Importantly , because this value is no longer updated during refinement , it essentially behaves as a filament continuity constraint . We then created a particle stack with the remaining unbinned segments extracted from micrographs containing an electron dose of ~ 25 e – / Å 2 . With these segment stacks and the restrained alignment parameter set , we started a new refinement with a 5 - to 7 - Å - resolution map from the previous iteration and a sampling rate of 0 . 9° . After the alignment - angle distribution seemed to be converged , we replaced the segments’ stack for one containing only an ~ 16 e – / Å 2 dose and finalized the refinement . For the AppNHp , ADP – BeF x , ADP – P i and ADP datasets , the resolution during the restrained refinement was calculated with a masked FSC . For the ADP dataset , we further discarded micrographs with large drift or few Thon rings before the restrained search . This procedure was not done before refinement , because these micrographs can still contribute to low - frequency features and therefore improve the early stages of alignment . For the JASP datasets , we used the final alignment parameters to perform a 2D classification without alignment . Segments belonging to bad classes were discarded , and we restarted the final iteration with the remaining particles . All local resolution and local filtering calculations were performed in SPHIRE 69 . Atomic - model building , refinement and analysis . We used the available structure of F - actin ( PDB 5JLF 32 , 33 ) as a starting atomic model . We performed a preliminary fit of the central five subunits and directly measured the helical symmetry from them . The small differences in rise observed in the different datasets can be attributed to the error in the estimation of the pixel size . Afterward , five protomers were always included in the modeling , and helical symmetry was always enforced . Given that some of our structures show substantial differences at the D loop and C - terminal tail , we rebuilt this region in rosettaCM 70 . We generated ~ 5 , 000 models for the F - actin – AppNHp , F - actin – ADP – BeF x and F - actin – ADP maps , and chose the best 100 for each of them . We then calculated the average secondary - structure content of the newly modeled loops . We took the model with the lowest energy that , in addition , had a secondary - structure content similar to the average of the best 100 . With that model , we ran a short MDFF simulation 71 , with the CHARMM36m force field 72 , to further accommodate the new regions into the density . In this step , His73 was protonated to mimic the effect of its methylation . All MDFF calculations were set up and performed with VMD / NAMD 73 , 74 . After further manual adjustments in Coot 75 , we used between one and two rounds of iterative rebuilding in Rosetta 76 to generate 960 models each time . For the JASP maps , we used the ADP – BeF x models as a starting point . To avoid overfitting , we modeled against a half map and tested the fit to the second half . After convergence assessment , the model with the best quality was locally refined with minimization and repacking in Rosetta 77 . For ligands , Rosetta creates an approximate parameter set from the molecule’s chemical nature , assuming that the staring model is close to an energy minimum . To ensure proper modeling of the Mg 2 + – nucleotide ligand , we included a set of distance restraints during modeling . After iterative rebuilding , we selected the best model , added an octahedral water coordination to the magnesium and performed a final relaxation of the structure in Rosetta . At the last stage , we methylated His73 in its ideal geometry and regularized it in Coot 75 . The final models were selected on the basis of MolProbity 78 and EMRinger 42 statistics . Alanine - scanning calculations were performed in the Robetta webserver 79 . PCA of the final models was performed with GROMACS 80 . Modeling of the F - actin – coronin complex . We modeled the F - actin – coronin complex , in the ADP and ADP – BeF x states , by combining the available subnanometer maps for the complex between rabbit skeletal muscle actin and yeast coronin 40 , and our final models . For coronin , we built a homology model based on the available mouse structure 81 in MODELLER 82 . To model into the density , we used MDFF 71 with the CHARMM36m force field 72 and an implicit solvation model . His73 was protonated to mimic its methylation . F - actin side chains in contact with coronin were free to move while the rest of the protein’s heavy atoms were restrained to their initial positions . Measuring coronin - 1B binding affinity via TIRF microscopy with single - filament analysis . To lock actin in different actin - nucleotide states , buffers described in the following paragraph contained ADP , AppNHp or ADP plus KP i . For the JASP experiments , actin was polymerized in the presence of a 2 × molar excess of JASP ; furthermore , all buffers contained 100 nM JASP . 4 μ M actin monomers ( 20 % Atto488 - actin ) were polymerized for 1 h at RT in KMEI ( 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EDTA and 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 ) , 15 mM KCl ( replaced by KP i for ADP – P i ) , 1 mM TCEP and 0 . 3 mM ADP or AppNHp . Flow chambers were prepared from microscopy counter slides passivated with PLL - PEG and functionalized cover slips according to ref . 56 . Flow - cell surfaces were blocked for 5 min with a Pluronic block solution ( 0 . 1 mg / ml κ - casein , 1 % Pluronic F - 127 , 1 mM TCEP and 1 × KMEI ) , followed by two washes with 40 μ l of wash buffer ( 0 . 5 mM ADP / AppNHp , 1 mM TCEP , 1 × KMEI , 0 . 1 mg / ml β - casein and 15 mM KP i / KCl , pH 7 . 0 ) . The channel was incubated with 85 nM streptavidin ( Sigma Aldrich ) for 2 min , washed and incubated with 200 nM biotinylated heavy meromyosine for 2 min . Polymerized filaments were diluted tenfold into wash buffer and immobilized in the channel for another 2 min . After a final washing step , 10 μ l of coronin - 1B – SNAP - Surface Alexa Fluor 647 was mixed with 26 μ l assay buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 0 , 50 mM KCl , 15 mM KP i / KCl , 1 mM ADP / AppNHp , 4 % glycerol , 4 mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 15 mg / ml β - casein ) and 4 μ l oxygen - scavenging system 54 – 56 , thus yielding final coronin - 1B concentrations between 5 nM and 5 μ M . TIRF microscopy , settings and data analysis . All experiments were performed at RT with a custom - built TIRF microscope ( OLYMPUS IX81 ) . Image acquisition was done with an EM CCD Andor iXon 888 camera controlled by Micromanager 1 . 4 software . Fiji ImageJ was used for image and data analysis . Dual - color imaging was performed through a 60 × OLYMPUS APO N TIRF objective with TOPTICA IBeam smart 640s or 488s lasers and a Quad - Notch filter ( 400 - 410 / 488 / 561 / 631 - 640 ) . For each condition , the average filament - associated intensity of the coronin - 1B – SNAP - AlexaFluor647 signal was measured from ≥ 70 filaments . The background intensity was subtracted from the coronin - 1B – SNAP - Alexa Fluor 647 signal for each measurement . All mean values with error bars representing s . e . m . were fitted with a hyperbola function , y = ( P1 × x ) / ( P2 + x ) , with P1 = maximum lattice signal ( in absorbance units ) and P2 = K d of coronin - 1B for actin ( in nanomolar ) . The data plotting and curve fitting were performed in Origin9 . 0G . Reporting Summary .
