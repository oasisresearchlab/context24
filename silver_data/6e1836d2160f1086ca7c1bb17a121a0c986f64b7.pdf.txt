It is desirable that crowd members build on each other ' s ideas to achieve synergy . This study proposes and verifies a new method for idea combination which can result in combined ideas that are both novel and useful . The domain - specific knowledge of crowd members does not influence the effectiveness of such idea combination . The new method can be used for collecting highly creative ideas from the crowd . The implications for future research are discussed . Keywords : crowdsourcing , idea generation , idea combination , creativity , educational game , mechanical turk . 1 Introduction In the pursuit of innovation , many companies have adopted the open innovation approach and try to benefit from external ideas and inventions ( Cassiman and Valentini , 2016 ; Chesbrough , 2011 ; Przybylska , 2013 ) . Collecting ideas through crowdsourcing has become a common practice in open innovation ( Bayus , 2013 ; Howe , 2006 ; Poetz and Schreier , 2012 ) . Crowdsourcing can be defined as outsourcing tasks to an undefined , large group of people through an open call ( Howe , 2006 ) . For example , some com - panies collect product or service ideas from consum - ers through online platforms ( Bayus , 2013 ; Terwiesch and Ulrich , 2009 ; Toubia , 2006 ) . Crowdsourcing enables many people to search for creative ideas in parallel ( Afuah and Tucci , 2012 ; Michelucci and Dickinson , 2016 ; Ren , et al . , 2014 ) . When a crowd has the knowledge and motivation , this crowdsourcing approach improves the chance of developing effective solutions to a company’s problems ( Afuah and Tucci , 2012 ; Poetz and Schreier , 2012 ) . In many crowdsourced tasks , people work as individuals and compete with each other for a prize ( Ebner , et al . , 2009 ; Leimeister , et al . , 2009 ) . Alternatively , people’s work can also be coordinated such that there is collaboration or integration ( Kittur , et al . , 2013 ; Michelucci and Dickinson , 2016 ; Ren , et al . , 2014 ) . The most famous crowd collaboration may be Wikipedia , an encyclopedia that anyone with Internet access can edit . Wikipedia exemplifies the benefits of a well - designed mechanism for coor - dinating crowds’ work . Collaborative idea generation in a crowd has recently drawn much attention ( Luo and Toubia , 2015 ; Siangliulue , et al . , 2015 ) . Since there can easily be hundreds or thousands of members in a crowd , or - ganizing crowd collaboration in ideation is different from organizing group brainstorming . A simple ap - proach is to show every crowd member some peers’ good ideas that can be served as examples and stimu - li ( Luo and Toubia , 2015 ; Wang , et al . , 2013 ) . Many online platforms such as quirky . com , allourideas . org , and OpenIDEO . com ( Siangliulue , et al . , 2015 ) allow such kind of idea sharing and inspiration . Seeing others’ ideas might help people come up with ideas that they would not have thought of otherwise ( Gar - field , et al . , 2001 ; Nijstad and Stroebe , 2006 ; Siangliulue , et al . , 2015 ) . However , seeing others’ ideas might also constrain thinking to similar ideas ( Jansson and Smith , 1991 ; Smith , et al . , 1993 ; Sio , et al . , 2015 ) . It is often argued that combining dis - similar ideas is an effective way to generate creative ideas ( Chan and Schunn , 2015 ; Osborn , 1953 ) . How - ever , idea combination has its own pitfalls . First , two randomly selected ideas might not be compatible to be combined . Second , a combined idea is not nec - essarily a better idea ( Chan and Schunn , 2015 ; Flem - ing , 2001 ) . To address these two issues , this study 204 Kai Wang , Hui Wang , Yu Tao designs a novel idea combination approach to gener - ate high - quality , creative ideas from the crowd . A first batch of ideas was collected from the first crowd and evaluated with regard to novelty and use - fulness . Then the three most novel ideas and the three most useful ideas were simultaneously present - ed to the second crowd ( distinct from the first crowd ) , who were asked to combine some elements from the novel ideas and the useful ideas . The pur - pose of idea combination is to have the crowd build on previous high quality ideas by achieving a bal - ance between novelty and usefulness . This study shows the effectiveness of idea combina - tion method via a user study that involves Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to develop an online pri - vacy education game prototype . As previous studies have shown that personal differences can moderate the effect of interventions to improve creativity ( Al - thuizen and Wierenga 2014 ; Luo and Toubia 2015 ) , this study also investigates the impact of crowd members’ domain - specific knowledge on the effec - tiveness of idea combination in the user study . 2 Background Because crowdsourcing has the potential to tap into the intellectual ability of a large number of people , it has attracted much research attention . Afuah and Tucci ( 2012 ) theorized that crowdsourcing innova - tion is particularly useful when : 1 ) the focal problem is easy to describe and can be broken down to relatively independent compo - nents ; 2 ) when solutions lie out of a company ' s expertise ; 3 ) required knowledge to solve the problem is pervasive in a crowd . There are many empirical studies showing the bene - fits of crowdsourcing innovation , such as generating better product ideas than internal personnel ( Poetz and Schreier , 2012 ; Schweitzer , et al . , 2012 ) , in - creasing the number of new products ( Laursen , 2011 ) , and resulting in revenue from new products ( Lilien , et al . , 2002 ; Nishikawa , et al . , 2013 ) . Researchers have started to envision new ways of organizing crowds to achieve important results . For example , researchers propose to design sophisti - cated workflows and even eco - systems of crowd workers to solve complicated problems ( Kittur , et al . , 2013 ; Michelucci and Dickinson , 2016 ; Siangliulue et al . , 2015 ) . However , there is still limited effort for facilitating creative ideation of crowds . Specifi - cally , as argued by some researchers ( Majchrzak and Malhotra , 2013 ) , crowdsourcing projects are rarely designed to facilitate idea combination , a common approach to promote creativity . Even though some crowdsourcing websites allow people to see and comment on peers’ ideas , these websites usually don’t guide people to combine ideas . Idea combination is commonly considered a good approach for creative ideation ( Chan and Schunn , 2015 ; Osborn , 1953 ) . Being exposed to one idea might lead to fixation , that is , exploring only do - mains related to the idea ( Jansson and Smith , 1991 ; Perttula and Sipila , 2007 ) . In idea combination , how - ever , people are exposed to multiple ideas and are less likely to fixate on one idea ( Wang , et al . , 2013 ) . Combining the elements from two ideas may lead to new ideas with emergent properties ( Kohn , et al . , 2011 ) . Therefore , it is clear that idea combination has the potential to improve idea creativity ( Chan and Schunn , 2015 ; Osborn , 1953 ) . Some researchers propose to use human - based genet - ic algorithms to use idea combination in crowdsourc - ing ( Ren , et al . , 2014 ; Yu and Nickerson , 2011 , 2013 ) . Specifically , one crowd creates a first genera - tion of ideas , and then the ideas are evaluated and ranked by another crowd . A third crowd creates a new generation of ideas by combining previous ideas . The selection of ideas to be combined can be biased towards highly evaluated ideas ( Ren , et al . , 2014 ; Yu and Nickerson , 2011 , 2013 ) . Repeating these steps can lead to multiple generations of ideas . However , the effect of such idea combination is not always significant . In one study , the genetic algorithms led to better designs of chairs , but only after two iterations ( i . e . , the third generation ideas were better than the first generation ideas ) ( Yu and Nickerson , 2011 ) . In an - other experiment on designing graphical advertise - ment , combination - based genetic algorithms led to no improvement in design quality ( Ren , et al . , 2014 ) . There are multiple reasons why idea combination does not always work . Combining Ideas in Crowdsourced Idea Generation 205 First , not every pair of ideas can be combined in meaningful ways . Second , a new idea generated by combination is not always a better idea . Creativity is commonly defined as being novel and useful ( Hen - nessey and Amabile , 2010 ) . A combined idea can have some novel elements but could seem bizarre and thus less practical or useful ( Fleming , 2001 ; Ren et al . , 2014 ) . In addition , it has been argued that idea combination sometimes results in good ideas , and sometimes results in bad ideas . Therefore , on average , idea combination may not have a strong effect ( Chan and Schunn , 2015 ; Girotra , et al . , 2010 ) . In summary , idea combination has the potential to improve idea creativity . It is desirable to be able to tap into crowds’ ideas and their combinatory pos - sibilities . Yet , there is a lack of effective methods to use idea combination in crowdsourced ideation . 3 Hypothesis development To achieve synergy among crowd members , specific methods for idea combination need to be developed . Typically , we want crowds to generate creative ide - as . Since creativity is commonly conceptualized as having two dimensions : novelty and usefulness ( Hennessey and Amabile , 2010 ) , it is important to find an idea combination method that can result in ideas high in both novelty and usefulness . We propose the following method for organizing idea combination in crowdsourcing . First , we collect an initial batch of ideas , called greenfield ideas , from one crowd . Greenfield here means that the ideas are generated without seeing others’ ideas . These ideas are evaluated by the second crowd with regard to novelty and usefulness . Then , based on the evalua - tion , the three most novel ideas and the three most useful ideas are identified . Afterwards , another crowd , exposed to these six ideas , will be asked to combine some elements from both the novel ideas and the useful ideas . The ideas generated in this final step are called combined ideas . We contend that this idea combination method is effective in that it leads to some ideas that are both highly novel and highly useful . First , although not every pair of ideas can be easily integrated , when a crowd member is exposed to six ideas , it is likely that meaningful idea combination can be achieved . Second , some combined ideas will be highly novel due to elements coming from highly novel ideas ( Berg , 2014 ) . In addition , when people read different ideas , these ideas will activate different knowledge in mind ( Nijstad and Stroebe 2006 ) . In trying to combine distinct ideas , people need to make further associations or analogies to connect different knowledge activated . The extended associations and new analogies will most likely improve the idea novelty ( Berg , 2014 ; Ren , et al . , 2014 ) . Third , since three of the candidate ideas to be combined are high - ly useful , the combined ideas tend to be useful be - cause they are built on elements from highly useful ideas . Therefore , combining novel ideas and useful ideas may lead to ideas that are both novel and use - ful . Similarly , Berg ( 2014 ) argues that combining a commonly used concept and a new concept can lead to ideas that balance novelty and usefulness . An important related notion is that both broad explo - ration and deep exploration can improve creativity ( Rietzschel , et al . , 2007 ) . Broad exploration can be defined as searching different categories of ideas ( Althuizen and Wierenga , 2014 ) . Deep exploration is defined as searching within a specific semantic cate - gory beyond obvious ideas ( Rietzschel , et al . , 2007 ) . Consistent with this notion of deep and broad explo - ration , a study on scientific publications shows that highly impactful publications use both combinations within a specific scientific domain and combinations across domains ( Uzzi , et al . , 2013 ) . Applying the notion to a crowdsourcing context , when being exposed to unusual ideas , people may be led to broadly explore into different categories of ideas . When being exposed to useful ideas , people may be led to explore common categories but beyond the obvious ideas . If people are asked to combine highly novel ideas and highly useful ideas , they are likely to conduct both broad exploration and deep explora - tion . Consequently , they tend to generate highly creative ideas . In summary , combining novel and useful ideas has the potential to result in ideas that are both novel and useful , that is , creative . However , there is no guaran - tee that all combined ideas will be more creative than greenfield ideas . Not all ideas can be combined in meaningful ways and not every crowd member is skillful in such combinations . 206 Kai Wang , Hui Wang , Yu Tao Therefore , such positive potential may not be clear in average ideas , but only in the most creative ideas . In other words , the best combined ideas should be more creative than the best greenfield ideas . For example , if we have one hundred combined ide - as and one hundred greenfield ideas , the top thirty creative combined ideas should be more creative than the counterpart in greenfield ideas . H1 . The most creative combined ideas are more creative than the most creative greenfield ideas . Researchers have found that personal differences moderate the impact of methods for improving crea - tive idea generation . For example , it was found that example solutions improve creativity for people with lower creative ability , not people with high creative ability ( Althuizen and Wierenga , 2014 ) . Luo and Toubia ( 2015 ) argue that domain - specific knowledge can moderate the effect of using peers’ ideas as stimuli . They contend that while experts have struc - tured domain knowledge and think in abstract ways , novices think in a more concrete way with less struc - tured domain knowledge . Consequently , showing peers’ ideas as concrete idea examples fits better with cognitive structures of novices . Seeing peers’ ideas can also lead to cognitive fixation : people may fixate on the knowledge represented in stimulus ideas and limit their exploration of solution space . They further ar - gue that fixation is more likely to occur when people have greater knowledge and the stimuli are more familiar to them . Consequently , people with more domain knowledge tend to fixate more and suffer more from the nega - tive impact of fixation . The researchers conclude that showing peers’ ideas benefits novices more than experts . On the other hand , responsiveness to stimuli is positively related to the similarity of stimuli to one’s present cognitive state ( Coskun , et al . , 2000 ) . When people have more domain knowledge , they are more likely to understand and be responsive to ideas in the domain . Furthermore , to be able to integrate distinct ideas effectively , people need high levels of domain knowledge . Berg ( 2014 ) argues that to combine concepts that are not obviously related , people often need to use analogical thinking , trying to identify the structural similarity and potential con - nections between concepts and their associations . This process apparently can benefit from high level of domain knowledge . Chan and Schunn ( 2015 ) show that combining distant ideas does not neces - sarily lead to better solutions . However , better solu - tions are likely to emerge by building on those com - binations and explore deeper with more iterations . We contend that people with high level of domain knowledge are more likely to work on idea combina - tion and think deeper with further elaboration . There - fore , we propose the following hypothesis . We propose that people with more domain - specific knowledge can benefit more from idea combination in our method . In other words , if idea combination increases creativity , the degree of such an increase should be higher for people with more domain knowledge . H2 . Crowd members’ domain knowledge moderates the effect of idea combination such that people with high level of domain knowledge benefit more from idea combination . 4 Methods The creative task used in the study is related to our project that develops a simple online game prototype to educate the game players on online privacy . The game listed a number of social media posts that can potentially lead to privacy concerns , for exam - ple , a post showing the address of one’s new house and when the house will be unoccupied . Using a multiple choice question format , the players were asked to identify privacy issues and ways to fix the problems . The webpage for the game is : http : / / web . stevens . edu / depet / html / main _ menu . html The game had been equipped with the content ( i . e . , social media posts ) . But there was a lack of game rules and reward strategies . Therefore , we employed US - based workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk for the generation of creative ideas of game rules and reward strategies . We generated a crowdsourcing task on Amazon Me - chanical Turk to collect the crowd’s ideas . Specifi - cally , the workers were instructed to play the game and then asked to generate one idea about game rules and reward strategies so that people would be moti - vated to play . Combining Ideas in Crowdsourced Idea Generation 207 To obtain greenfield ideas , we collected 100 re - sponses from 100 workers . In these 100 responses , we removed eight responses that are not ideas ( such as negative comments on the game ) . The remaining 92 ideas were evaluated on idea novelty and idea usefulness , both on the 7 - point Likert scale with 7 being most novel or useful . Usefulness is defined as “the degree to which an idea is feasible and effec - tive” and novelty is defined as “the degree to which an idea is not only rare but also ingenious , imagina - tive or surprising” ( Dean et al . 2006 ) . In this context , an idea is effective if it describes game rules and reward strategies that are appealing and motivating for game players , and most importantly , make the game an effective tool for online privacy education . Since the game was designed to educate the general public , the general public is the target audience of the game and should be able to evaluate ideas for game rules . Therefore , we believe that crowd workers are arguably qualified to evaluate the game ideas . Each greenfield idea was evaluated on the two dimensions of novelty and usefulness by twenty crowd workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk . This is aligned with the finding that it takes twenty crowd evaluations to reach reliable measurement of idea quality ( Riedl , et al . , 2013 ) . To encourage serious consideration in the idea evaluation , the workers were instructed to explain the reasoning behind rat - ings . The twenty scores in evaluation were averaged to obtain idea ratings . Based on idea ratings , the three most novel ideas ( as idea group A ) and the three most useful ideas ( as idea group B ) were iden - tified . One idea was in both group A and group B . This idea was kept in group A but removed from group B . The fourth most useful idea was used to replace this idea in group B . Another 100 crowd workers ( distinct from the previous 100 workers ) were instructed to generate one idea on the same creative task as mentioned before . In the instruction , there was a link to a webpage listing idea group A and idea group B . The workers were asked to com - bine some idea elements from group A and some elements from group B . After removing six non - idea responses , we collected 94 combined ideas . These combined ideas were fur - ther evaluated , using the exact same method as be - fore . Idea creativity is calculated as the sum of novelty and usefulness . Since creativity is usually defined as being both novel and useful , it is a com - mon practice to calculate creativity scores as the sum or average of novelty and usefulness scores ( Al - thuizen and Wierenga , 2014 ; Burroughs , et al . , 2011 ; Massetti , 1996 ) . All the idea generation tasks had a payment of $ 0 . 5 . To improve motivation , the workers were promised a $ 20 bonus if their ideas were adopted . All the idea evaluation tasks had a payment of $ 0 . 05 . The crowd workers who gener - ated ideas are 35 . 6 year old on average ( SD = 11 . 3 ) with 58 % being female . The domain knowledge of the participants who gen - erated ideas was measured using a 7 - item scale , de - veloped to assess domain - specific customer knowledge ( the general public is the “customer” of the game ) ( Luo and Toubia , 2015 ; Mitchell and Dacin , 1996 ) . Because the ideas are related to computer games , the domain is set as computer games . The scores are from 1 to 5 , with 5 being most knowledgeable . Example items include “I am very familiar with computer games . ” and “I read articles related to computer games all the time” . 5 Results We measured the novelty and usefulness of all ideas . Intraclass correlation coefficients show good levels of agreement among raters ( ICC = 0 . 70 for both novelty and usefulness ) . The measurement of do - main knowledge , which contains 7 items , also has a high level of reliability ( Cronbach’s alpha 0 . 869 ) . Idea novelty and usefulness show a positive correla - tion ( r = 0 . 625 , n = 186 , p < 0 . 001 ) . In both the greenfield ideas and the combined ideas , top 30 ideas were identified by finding the 30 ideas with the highest creativity ratings . Table 1 provides the summary of these data . From Table 1 , we can see that novelty , usefulness and creativity of all ideas do not differ significantly between the greenfield ideas and the combined ideas . Comparing the top 30 ideas in the two idea groups , although usefulness does not differ significantly , the top 30 combined ideas score significantly higher in novelty and creativity than the top 30 greenfield ideas . These results support hypothesis H1 . 208 Kai Wang , Hui Wang , Yu Tao To test hypothesis H2 , we used the following equa - tion for linear regression : y (cid:3404) β (cid:2868) (cid:3397) β (cid:2869) (cid:3400) x (cid:2869) (cid:3397) β (cid:2870) (cid:3400) x (cid:2870) (cid:3397) β (cid:2871) (cid:3400) x (cid:2869) (cid:3400) x (cid:2870) (cid:3397) ε with y being idea creativity , x 1 being domain knowledge of the participant , x 2 being idea combina - tion ( 0 or 1 , representing greenfield or combined ideas , respectively ) , ε being the error term . The product of x 1 and x 2 stands for the interaction of the two variables . If the proposed moderation effect exists , we should find significant interaction effect . Table 2 represents the results of the regres - sion . There is no significant interaction effect be - tween domain knowledge and idea combination . Table 1 .

In addition to regressions , we also looked into the effect of idea combination on high and low knowledge participants . Specifically , we identified groups of participants with high or low level of domain knowledge ( scoring at least one standard deviation above or below average ) . Based on t - tests ( data not shown ) , idea combination did not significantly influence either high knowledge partic - ipants or low knowledge participants . Therefore , we find no support for hypothesis H2 . 6 Discussion This research tries to establish a simple approach for improving crowd idea generation and identify the role of domain knowledge in it . Previous studies often show that idea combination in crowdsourcing does not lead to better ideas ( Chan and Schunn , 2015 ; Ren , et al . , 2014 ) , despite the popular notion that combining ideas is an effective way to improve creativity . Combining Ideas in Crowdsourced Idea Generation 209 In our study , even though our idea combination method did not improve average idea creativity , the most creative combined ideas were clearly more creative than the most creative greenfield ideas . In practice , people usually care much more about the best ideas that a crowd generates , rather than average idea quality . As predicted in hypothesis H1 , when crowd members were asked to combine elements from highly novel ideas and highly useful ideas , their best ideas were more creative than the best green - field ideas . This positive result indicates that we can use this simple idea combination method to achieve more creative outcome than otherwise . Combining highly novel ideas and highly useful ideas tends to achieve a balance between novelty and usefulness and lead to highly creative ideas . In addition , highly novel and highly useful ideas , by the very nature , are often dissimilar . Therefore , people are required to think deeply to combine dis - similar ideas . In addition , novel examples tend to promote broad exploration of the solution space , while useful examples tend to promote deep explora - tion ( Althuizen and Wierenga , 2014 ) . The combina - tion of these two types of ideas can potentially facilitate both types of exploration and benefit crea - tivity ( Althuizen and Wierenga , 2014 ; Schilling and Green , 2011 ; Uzzi , et al . , 2013 ) . The data analysis also shows that the top 30 com - bined ideas are higher in novelty but not in useful - ness , compared to the top 30 greenfield ideas . This is consistent with the view that idea combination tends to benefit novelty but not usefulness ( Fleming , 2001 ) . In fact , Fleming ( 2001 ) argues that novel combination leads to poorer usefulness on average , even though it creases the variability in usefulness . However , in our study , idea combination did not reduce average idea usefulness : this is probably be - cause the combined ideas have elements from highly useful idea examples . The regression results ( Table 2 ) show that there is no significant main effect of either idea combination or domain knowledge . This is consistent with the study by Luo and Toubia ( 2015 ) , where they also show no main effect of domain knowledge or expo - sure to stimulus ideas . Furthermore , the data sug - gests that there is no interaction effect between domain knowledge and idea combination , which is in conflict with our hypothesis H2 . The hypothesis H2 proposes that people with high levels of domain knowledge would benefit more from idea combination . It is possible that this posi - tive effect is counteracted by the following two fac - tors . First , people with more domain knowledge might think in more abstract ways and benefit less from concrete idea examples ( Luo and Toubia , 2015 ) . Second , there could be a ceiling effect in idea evaluation , that is , the tendency that people are reluc - tant to give extremely high evaluations . Consequent - ly , detecting an improvement on idea quality when the idea quality of greenfield ideas is already good can be difficult . More research is needed to identify the exact reasons . In the practice of crowdsourcing creative task , this study suggests that using the simple idea combina - tion approach can lead to ideas of high creativity . We mentioned before that there are many websites that solicit ideas from the crowd , such as quirky . com , allourideas . org , and OpenIDEO . com . In these web - sites , it may be beneficial to : 1 ) identify two idea groups , that is , the most novel ideas and the most useful ideas from previous participants ; 2 ) list them on the homepage ; 3 ) encourage people to combine some idea ele - ments from both idea groups . This simple technique may increase the creativity of the best ideas . This study also has some implications for future research . We confirm that combined ideas , on aver - age , are not necessarily more creative than ideas generated from scratch . However , certain methods can be developed to improve the best ideas generat - ed . Other methods for finding candidates for idea combination can be investigated or combined with our approach , for example , using crowd approaches or computational approaches to filter out similar ideas ( Siangliulue , et al . , 2015 ) . Detailed guidance on idea combination might be integrated with our approach to further improve crowdsourcing creative tasks . For example , using step - by - step instructions of analogy ( Knoll and Hor - ton , 2011 ) or other creativity techniques ( Couger , 210 Kai Wang , Hui Wang , Yu Tao et al . , 1993 ; Summers and White , 1976 ; Wang , 2014 ) might work . Developing all these approaches can help improve synergy among crowd members and achieve remarkably creative outcome . 7 Conclusion We introduced a simple approach to finding candi - dates for idea combination in crowdsourced creative tasks and showed that it can increase the creativity of best ideas generated . In our experiment , the do - main knowledge has no main effect on idea creativi - ty , and surprisingly , no interaction effect with idea com - bination . This new approach can be used to enhance collective idea generation in crowdsourc - ing . It also suggests some future research topics aim - ing at creative collaboration among crowd members . 8 References [ 1 ] Afuah , A . , Tucci , C . L . , 2012 .
