Although authors concluded that injurious INCONSISTENT FINDINGS ON THE CAPACITY ventilation may initiate local release of inﬂammatory cytokines ( 23 ) , the interpretation of this study is not straightforward for OF SOME MODES OF VENTILATION TO PROMOTE the following reasons . First , ischemia resulting from the lack of CYTOKINE RELEASE IN VIVO perfusion may signiﬁcantly alter signal progression along the This is a most controversial issue . A key point is that it is often cytokine network . Second , the presence of a “boosting” effect not possible to reproduce typical ex vivo experiments in intact of endotoxin on BAL TNF - (cid:1) in the mild but not in the high V t animals . For instance , mechanical ventilation with a very high group is difﬁcult to explain .

Not surprisingly , plasma TNF - (cid:1) the only prospect of reducing cytokines is doubtful unless a was very high ( around 36 , 000 pg / ml ) in these animals . However , precise response curve linking V t reduction on the one hand to plasma TNF - (cid:1) was also quite high ( around 12 , 000 pg / ml ) after cytokine release and survival on the other is established ( which 2 hours of protective ventilation in the group not given endotoxin seems neither feasible nor desirable ) .
