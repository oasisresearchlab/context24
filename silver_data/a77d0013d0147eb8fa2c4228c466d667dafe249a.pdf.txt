LONG and Javier F . CACERES 1 Medical Research Council Human Genetics Unit , Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine , Western General Hospital , Edinburgh EH4 2XU , U . K . The SR protein family comprises a number of phylogenetically conserved and structurally related proteins with a characteristic domain rich in arginine and serine residues , known as the RS do - main . They play signiﬁcant roles in constitutive pre - mRNA spli - cing and are also important regulators of alternative splicing . In addition they participate in post - splicing activities , such as mRNA nuclearexport , nonsense - mediatedmRNAdecayandmRNAtrans - lation . These wide - ranging roles of SR proteins highlight their importance as pivotal regulators of mRNA metabolism , and if these functions are disrupted , developmental defects or disease may result . Furthermore , animal models have shown a highly speciﬁc , non - redundant role for individual SR proteins in the regu - lation of developmental processes . Here , we will review the current literature to demonstrate how SR proteins are emerging as one of the master regulators of gene expression . Key words : alternative splicing , pre - mRNA splicing , RS domain , SR proteins , SR - related proteins , translation regulation . INTRODUCTION Pre - mRNA splicing was discovered in the late 1970s when it was demonstrated that eukaryotic genes contained intervening sequences , or introns , that were not present in the mature mRNA [ 1 , 2 ] . Subsequent studies showed that introns are removed by a macromolecular complex , termed the spliceosome , which consists of ﬁve snRNPs [ small nuclear RNPs ( ribonucleoprotein particles ) ] , U1 , U2 , U4 , U5 and U6 , and a large number of protein components ( reviewed in [ 3 , 4 ] ) . Spliceosomal assembly is initiated by the recognition of the 5 (cid:2) and 3 (cid:2) ss ( splice sites ) by the U1 snRNP and the heterodimeric U2AF ( U2 snRNP auxiliary factor ) respectively , forming the E complex . Recruitment of the U2 snRNP to the BP ( branch - point ) , in an ATP - dependent manner , results in the formation of the A complex . Subsequent recruitment of the U4 / U6 · U5 tri - snRNP forms the B complex , which is followed by a series of structural rearrangements leading to the formation of the catalytically active spliceosomal C complex ( reviewed in [ 5 ] ) . The spliceosome is a dynamic structure and more than 300 proteins have been identiﬁed in active splicing complexes [ 6 – 8 ] ( reviewed in [ 9 ] ) . The aim of this article is to review the contribution of SR protein family members to pre - mRNA splicing , as well as reviewing more recent studies expanding their role in post - splicing activities . Finally , we will discuss how misregulation of SR protein functions can lead to human disease . THE SR PROTEIN FAMILY The SR proteins were ﬁrst discovered as splicing factors in the early 1990s ( reviewed in [ 10 – 12 ] ) . A protein domain rich in arginine and serine dipeptides , termed the RS domain , was originallyobservedinthree Drosophila splicingregulators , SWAP ( suppressor - of - white - apricot ) [ 13 ] , Tra ( transformer ) [ 14 ] and Tra - 2 ( transformer - 2 ) [ 15 ] . Subsequent identiﬁcation of SF2 / ASF ( splicing factor 2 / alternative splicing factor ) [ 16 , 17 ] and SC35 ( spliceosomal component 35 ) [ 18 ] revealed that these proteins contained an RS domain , which is also present in the U1 snRNP - associated protein , U1 - 70K [ 19 , 20 ] . SF2 / ASF was the ﬁrst SR protein to be identiﬁed as an activity required to complement an otherwise splicing - deﬁcient HeLa ( human cervical carcinoma cell ) S100 extract [ 21 ] and was also puriﬁed from HEK ( human embryonic kidney ) - 293 cells as a factor which could alter 5 (cid:2) ss selection of an SV40 ( simian virus 40 ) early pre - mRNA [ 22 ] . The term ‘SR protein’ was coined following identiﬁcation of additional RS domain - containing pro - teins that were recognized by a monoclonal antibody , mAb 104 , which binds to active sites of RNA polymerase II transcription [ 23 ] . These novel proteins , which were active in splicing comple - mentation , included the SR proteins SRp20 , SRp40 , SRp55 and SRp75 , named after their apparent molecular mass on an SDS / PAGE gel , and are conserved across vertebrates and invertebrates [ 24 ] . They have a modular structure containing one or two copies of an RRM ( RNA recognition motif ) at the N - terminus that provides RNA - binding speciﬁcity and a C - terminal RS domain that acts to promote protein – protein interactions that facilitate recruitment of the spliceosome [ 25 , 26 ] . The RS domain can also contact the pre - mRNA directly via the BP and the 5 (cid:2) ss , suggesting an alternative way to promote spliceosome assembly [ 27 , 28 ] ( reviewed in [ 29 ] ) . Furthermore , the RS domain acts as an NLS ( nuclear localization signal ) , affecting the subcellular localization of SR proteins by mediating the interaction with the SR protein nuclear import receptor , transportin - SR [ 30 – 32 ] . The prototypical SR protein , SF2 / ASF , functions in constitutive splicing and also modulates alternative splicing [ 22 , 33 ] .

Thus , the criteria used to deﬁne ‘classical’ SR protein family members are ( i ) structural similarity , ( ii ) dual function in constitutive and alternative splicing , ( iii ) the presence of a phosphoepitope recog - nised by mAb104 ; and ( iv ) their puriﬁcation using magnesium chloride ( Table 1 ) . A genome - wide survey in metazoans identiﬁed a large number of RS domain - containing proteins with a role not only in splicing but also in other cellular processes such as chromatin remodelling , transcription and cell cycle progression [ 36 ] . These related proteins contain an RS domain but may lack a deﬁned RRM , however a subset can bind RNA through other domains such as the PWI motif found in the splicing activator SRm160 [ 37 , 38 ] ( Tables 2 – 4 ) . These factors are collectively known as SR - like or SR - related proteins and include both subunits of the U2AF heterodimer , U1 - 70K and the splicing coactivators SRm 160 / 300 , among others [ 39 ] . It was recently proposed that SR proteins should be redeﬁned based on their common structural features and their role in pre - mRNA splicing [ 40 ] . Based on this , a ‘bona ﬁde’ SR protein has to contain at least one RRM and an RS domain ( irrespective of their positions within the protein ) and to function in constitutive or alternative splicing , as assayed by either complementation of splicing - deﬁcient S100 HeLa cytoplasmic extracts or in an alternative splicing assay respectively . The human homologues of the Drosophila splicing regulators Tra2 α [ 41 ] and Tra2 β [ 42 ] contain an RRM ﬂanked by two RS domains , which is not the domain structure found in classical SR proteins ( Figure 1 ) . Since both proteins function as sequence - speciﬁc splicing activators [ 43 ] , they could be classiﬁed as SR proteins ( Table 2 ) . Other proteins may contain an RS domain but also have c (cid:3) The Authors Journal compilation c (cid:3) 2009 Biochemical Society Functional roles of SR proteins in RNA processing 17 Table 4 Other RS - domain containing proteins Protein name Gene name Key domains Splicing role UniProt SRrp53 RSRC1 RS , coiled - coil domain Unknown Q96IZ7 hPRP5 DDX46 RS , DEAH box Spliceosomal rearrangement Q7L014 hPRP16 DHX38 RS , DEAH box Splicing factor Q92620 Prp22 / HRH1 DHX8 RS , DEAH box Spliceosomal rearrangement Q14562 U5 - 100k / hPRP28 DDX23 RS , DEAD box Spliceosomal rearrangement Q9BUQ8 ClkSty - 1 CLK1 RS , kinase domain SR protein kinase P49759 ClkSty - 2 CLK2 RS , kinase domain SR protein kinase P49760 ClkSty - 3 CLK3 RS , kinase domain SR protein kinase P49761 Prp4k PRPF4B RS , kinase domain SR protein kinase Q13523 CrkRS CRKRS RS , kinase domain SR protein kinase Q9NYV4 CDC2L5 CDC2L5 RS , kinase domain Alternative splicing regulator Q14004 Cyclin - L1 CCNL1 RS , cyclin - like domain × 2 Alternative splicing regulator Q9UK58 Cyclin - L2 CCNL2 RS , cyclin - like domain × 2 Alternative splicing regulator Q96S94 SR - cyp PPIG RS , PPIase cyclophilin - type domain Regulates localisation of SR proteins Q13427 CIR CIR RS Alternative splicing regulator Q86X95 SRrp130 SFRS18 RS × 2 Unknown Q8TF01 Figure 1 Schematic diagram of SR and SR - related proteins Thedomainstructuresaredepicted .

SR PROTEINS AND TRANSCRIPTION SR proteins are concentrated in nuclear speckles and are recruited from these sites to nascent sites of RNAP II ( RNA polymerase II ) transcription [ 46 ] . It is well documented that RNA splicing occurs co - transcriptionally [ 47 , 48 ] . Interactions between SR - related proteins and the CTD ( C - terminal domain ) of RNAP II have been reported [ 49 ] , and members of the SR protein family were identiﬁed among the hundreds of proteins present in the RNAP II complex [ 50 ] . It was recently reported that SC35 promotes RNAP II elongation in a subset of genes , conﬁrming the existence of coupling between transcription and splicing , and perhaps surprisingly , showing that this coupling can be bidirectional [ 51 ] ( reviewed in [ 52 ] ) . In this study [ 51 ] it was demonstrated that SC35 interacts not only with the CTD but also with CDK9 ( cyclin - dependent kinase 9 ) , which is the kinase component of the transcriptional elongation factor P - TEFb ( positive transcription elongation factor b ) , resulting in phosphorylation of Ser 2 in the CTD and leading to transcriptional elongation . This activity of SR proteins in transcriptional elongation may be functionally related to their reported effect in the maintenance of genome stability . It has been shown that depletion of SF2 / ASF , SC35 and the SR - related protein RNSP1 results in the formation of c (cid:3) The Authors Journal compilation c (cid:3) 2009 Biochemical Society 18 J . C . Long and J . F . Caceres R - loops ( RNA : DNAhybridstructures ) leadingtoahypermutation phenotype [ 53 – 55 ] . The co - transcriptional nature of pre - mRNA splicing underlies a role for the transcriptional machinery in alternative splicing regulation [ 56 ] . A kinetic coupling model proposed that changes in the rate of transcriptional elongation affect the timing in which splice sites are presented to the splicing machinery , leading to differential splice site selection [ 57 ] . Furthermore , differential recruitment of splicing factors to the CTD of RNAP II may also inﬂuence this process [ 58 ] ( reviewed in [ 59 ] ) . ROLES OF CLASSICAL SR PROTEINS IN CONSTITUTIVE AND ALTERNATIVE SPLICING Splice site consensus sequences are generally not sufﬁcient to direct assembly of a functional spliceosome , and auxiliary ele - ments known as ESEs and ISEs ( exonic and intronic splicing enhancers respectively ) and ESSs and ISSs ( exonic and intronic silencers respectively ) are involved in both constitutive and , to perhaps a greater extent , alternative splicing . Binding of SR proteins to ESEs acts as a barrier that prevents exon skipping , thus ensuring the correct 5 (cid:2) to 3 (cid:2) linear order of exons in spliced mRNA [ 60 ] . Two main models have been proposed to explain the mechanism by which SR proteins regulate exon inclusion . The ‘recruitment model’ focuses on the ability of ESE - bound SR proteins to recruit and stabilize interactions between the U1 snRNP at the 5 (cid:2) ss and U2AF65 at the 3 (cid:2) ss [ 61 ] , in a process known as exon deﬁnition [ 62 ] ( Figure 2A ) . The hnRNP ( heterogeneous nuclear RNP ) family comprises a structurally diverse group of RNA - binding proteins with roles in many aspects of RNA bio - genesis , including pre - mRNA splicing ( reviewed in [ 63 ] ) . In the ‘inhibitor model’ , ESE - bound SR proteins may act by antagonizing the negative activity of hnRNP proteins recognizing ESSs [ 64 ] ( Figure 2B ) . The SR proteins may also form a network of protein – protein interactions across introns to juxtapose the 5 (cid:2) and 3 (cid:2) ss early in spliceosomal assembly , as shown by the reported interactions of SF2 / ASF and SC35 with U1 - 70K at the 5 (cid:2) ss and with U2AF35 at the 3 (cid:2) ss in an RS domain - dependent manner [ 25 ] ( Figure 2C ) . Additionally , the enhancer - bound RS domain of the SR protein SF2 / ASF has been shown to interact directly with RNA at the BP to promote pre - spliceosomal assembly [ 27 , 28 ] . SR proteins may also facilitate the recruitment of the U4 / U6 · U5 tri - snRNP to the pre - spliceosome [ 65 ] via RS domain - mediated interactions with the SR - related proteins SRrp65 and SRrp110 [ 66 ] . The function of SF2 / ASF in pre - mRNA splicing depends on the context of the pre - mRNA sequence to which it binds , as shown by the fact that SF2 / ASF inhibits adenovirus IIIa pre - mRNA splicing when bound to an intronic repressor element [ 67 ] . The second RRM of SF2 / ASF , and in particular a phylogenetically conserved heptapeptide , SWQDLKD , which is located in the ﬁrst α - helix of this domain [ 68 ] , is essential for the splice site selection activity of SF2 / ASF [ 69 , 70 ] . The structure of this domain revealed an atypical RRM fold that binds to RNA in a novel manner [ 71 ] . Use of FRAP ( ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching ) approaches revealed a high mobility for SF2 / ASF within the nucleus , with kinetics compatible with a diffusion mechanism [ 72 , 73 ] . Advances in imaging have allowed analysis of splicing factors both in speckles and at other sites in the nucleoplasm by FRET ( ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer ) [ 74 , 75 ] . A recent study provided a map of SR protein splicing complexes in the nucleus , and showed that they act in exon and intron deﬁnition in vivo [ 76 ] . TheU12 - typeclassofpre - mRNAintrons , alsoknownasAT - AC introns , are spliced by the less abundant U12 - dependent ( minor ) spliceosome . The 5 (cid:2) ss and BP sequences are highly conserved in Figure 2 Roles of SR proteins in splice site selection ( A ) SR proteins bound to ESE elements recruit U2AF35 to an upstream 3 (cid:2) ss and U1 - 70K to the downstream 5 (cid:2) ss . ( B ) ESSs recruit hnRNP proteins which block 3 (cid:2) ss selection by U2AF . SR proteins bound to ESEs can antagonize the action of these splicing repressors , thereby promoting splice site selection . ( C ) SR proteins can facilitate intron bridging interactions by binding , via the RS domain , to U1 - 70K and U2AF 35 , thereby juxtaposing the 5 (cid:2) and 3 (cid:2) ss . AT - AC introns , unlike the degenerate sequences found in GT - AG introns ( reviewed in [ 77 ] ) . The SR proteins have been shown to participate in AT - AC intron splicing where they promote binding of the U11 and U12 snRNPs to the 5 (cid:2) ss and BP respectively [ 78 ] . There is also evidence that SR proteins contact the pre - mRNA of U12 - type introns directly via their RS domain , again in an analogous fashion to that seen in conventional splicing [ 79 ] . A delicate interplay of cis - acting sequences and trans - acting factors modulate the splicing of regulated exons in a combinatorial fashion [ 80 ] . SR family proteins antagonize the activity of hnRNP A / B proteins in splice site selection , with an excess of hnRNP A1 favouring distal 5 (cid:2) ss , whereas SF2 / ASF promotes the use of proximal5 (cid:2) ss [ 81 – 85 ] . Thus , theratioofhnRNPA1toSRproteins in the nucleus is of great importance in alternative splicing regul - ation and may have a crucial role in the tissue - speciﬁc and devel - opmental control of regulated splicing . Accordingly , the protein levels of SF2 / ASF and hnRNP A1 have been found to vary naturally over a very wide range in rat tissues and also in immortal and transformed cell lines [ 35 , 86 ] . SF2 / ASF and hnRNP A1 have also been found to have an antagonistic role in the regulation of the neuronal - speciﬁc N1 exon of the c - src gene [ 87 ] . Antagonism between hnRNP proteins and SR proteins has also been shown to regulate a highly complex pattern of mutually exclusive exons in the Dscam ( Down’s syndrome cell adhesion molecule ) gene in Drosophila [ 88 ] . A subset of SR proteins has been shown to activate alternative splicing of the cTNT ( cardiac troponin T ) exon 5 by directly interacting with a purine - rich ESE . Thus regulation of the levels of individual SR proteins may contribute to the developmental regulation of alternative splicing in cTNT [ 89 ] . Interestingly , individual SR proteins can sometimes have antagonistic effects on splice site selection , as is the case with SRp20 and SF2 / ASF in the regulation of SRp20 pre - mRNA alternative splicing [ 90 ] and of SF2 / ASF and SC35 in the c (cid:3) The Authors Journal compilation c (cid:3) 2009 Biochemical Society Functional roles of SR proteins in RNA processing 19 regulation of β - tropomyosin [ 91 ] and human growth hormone pre - mRNA alternative splicing [ 92 ] . Other , non - classical , SR proteins , including p54 , SRp38 and SRp86 , function solely as negative regulators of alternative splicing , antagonizing classical SR proteins and promoting exon skipping [ 93 – 95 ] . SR PROTEIN TARGETS Several approaches have been taken to identify physiological RNA targets of SR proteins . One such approach , termed SELEX ( selected evolution of ligands through exponential enrichment ) involves the selection of high - afﬁnity binding sites from ran - domized pools of RNA sequences [ 96 ] . This has resulted in the identiﬁcation of high - afﬁnity binding sites for SF2 / ASF and SC35 [ 97 ] , SRp40 [ 98 ] , 9G8 and SRp20 [ 99 ] ( Table 5 ) . These binding sites consist of purine - rich sequences that resemble 5 (cid:2) ss or exonic sequences , known to function as splicing enhancers . SELEX can be used in conjunction with large - scale bioinformatic screens to identify further potential binding sites . An alternative to the SELEX approach was the development of a functional SELEX strategy , which involves selection for a sequence that will promote splicing , rather than binding alone [ 100 ] . This can be modiﬁed further by performing the splicing reactions in a S100 extract with the addition of a single SR protein [ 101 , 102 ] . The motifs identiﬁed for the SR proteins SF2 / ASF , SC35 , SRp40 and SRp55 using functional SELEX were more redundant than those found by conventional SELEX , suggesting that the speciﬁcity of binding in vivo depends on factors other than just sequence recognition ( Table 5 ) . These motifs have been integrated into a web - based program , known as ESE ﬁnder , where input sequences can be scanned for potential ESEs responsive to the above proteins [ 103 ] . A number of computational approaches have also been used to deﬁne splicing sequence motifs that regulate exon inclusion . RESCUE ( relative enhancer and silencer classiﬁcation by unanimous enrichment ) - ESE predicts sequences which could function as ESEs by statistical analysis of exon – intron and splice site composition [ 104 ] . This is based on the observation that ESEs function in a highly position - dependent fashion and are present in constitutively spliced exons and absent in introns . This approach identiﬁed 238 candidate ESEs that occurred more frequently in exons with weak splice sites than in exons with strong splice sites . By sequence similarity , these were condensed to ten RESCUE - ESE motif clusters and were shown to have enhancer activity in vivo . Another computational study found 2000 RNA octamers , identiﬁed as PESEs ( putative ESEs ) , that were found more frequently in exons than in pseudo - exons or intronless genes [ 105 ] . Validation of a subset of these PESEs resulted in 82 % exhibiting decreased splicing efﬁciency when the PESE was mutated [ 106 ] . ChIP ( chromatin immunoprecipitation ) can be used to study nascent RNA – protein interactions , but a variation of this technique named RIP ( RNP immuno - precipitation ) provides more information on protein – RNA interactions in vivo [ 107 ] . RIP in - volves cross - linking the protein – RNA interactions using formal - dehyde , followed by immuno - precipitation of the protein – RNA complexes . After reversing the cross - links , the RNA can be amp - liﬁed by RT – PCR ( reverse transcription – PCR ) . This technique relies on random hexamer primers to identify unknown RNAs or can be used in conjunction with microarray technology . Reasso - ciation of RNA - binding proteins after cell lysis can complicate the analysis of these results , since observed protein – RNA interactions may not necessarily reﬂect true in vivo interactions [ 108 ] .

Previously , a novel technique named CLIP ( cross - linking and immunoprecipitation ) was developed in order to identify in vivo RNA targets [ 111 ] . CLIP involves an in vivo photo cross - linking step to capture the protein – RNA interactions , followed by partial RNase digestion to generate RNA tags of approximately 60 nucleotides followed by speciﬁc immunoprecipitation of the protein of interest . An advantage of this method is that by using an in vivo photo cross - linking step , which induces a covalent protein – nucleic acid bond , these interactions are preserved in an intact cell . CLIP was used to characterize the in vivo RNA binding targets of the neuronal - speciﬁc splicing factor Nova and has allowed the generation of an RNA map to predict splicing regulation dependent on this protein [ 112 , 113 ] . It has also been used for other RNA binding proteins , including SF2 / ASF [ 114 ] ( Table 5 ) . The identiﬁcation of SR protein targets and the study of how tissue - speciﬁc patterns of splicing change , depending on the complement of SR proteins present , can also be analysed by alternative splicing microarrays [ 115 – 117 ] . The additional importance of structural elements in splice site selection should also be taken into account . For example , RNA structure elements associated with alternative splice - site selection have been recently identiﬁed in the human genome [ 118 ] . In addition , RNA folding has been shown to affect the recruitment of c (cid:3) The Authors Journal compilation c (cid:3) 2009 Biochemical Society 20 J . C . Long and J . F . Caceres SR proteins to mouse and human ESE elements in the ﬁbronectin EDA exon [ 119 , 120 ] . Finally , competing intronic RNA secondary structures help to deﬁne a complex pattern of mutually exclusive exons in the Dscam gene [ 121 ] . SR PROTEINS HAVE FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICITY Initially , the ability of different individual SR proteins to complement splicing - deﬁcient extracts suggested that SR proteins may have redundant functions . However , the sequence - speciﬁc RNA binding ability of individual SR proteins and differences in their ability to regulate alternative splicing suggested otherwise [ 35 , 122 , 123 ] . A growing body of evidence showed that individual SR proteins were not functionally equivalent in Drosophila , Caenorhabditis elegans and mouse models . For instance , SF2 / ASF was shown to be an essential factor for cell viability in a chicken cell line and its depletion could not be rescued by expression of SC35 or SRp40 , indicating a non - redundant function of SF2 / ASF [ 124 ] . Other studies have shown that the SR protein B52 / SRp55 is essential for Drosophila development [ 125 , 126 ] . B52 / SRp55 was shown not to be essential for the splicing of a number of substrates [ 127 ] , but speciﬁc substrates that were mis - spliced in B52 - deﬁcient ﬂies were identiﬁed [ 128 , 129 ] . Furthermore , B52 / SRp55 regulates the inclusion of alternative exon 2 in eyeless , a master regulator of eye development in Drosophila , resulting in the production of a protein isoform that gives rise to a small - eye phenotype . Conver - sely , the canonical eyeless isoform induces eye overgrowth [ 130 ] . Use of RNAi ( RNA interference ) to inhibit SR protein function during C . elegans development revealed that depletion of the orthologue of the mammalian SF2 / ASF ( CeSF2 / ASF ) resulted in embryonic lethality , which indicates an essential , non - redundant , role for this gene during nematode development . By contrast , RNAi - mediated depletion of other SR genes resulted in no obvious phenotype , which is indicative of functional redundancy [ 131 – 133 ] . The function of SR proteins has also been studied in mouse model systems ( recently reviewed in [ 134 ] ) . All SR - null mice for SRp20 [ 135 ] , SC35 [ 136 , 137 ] and SF2 / ASF [ 138 ] show an early embryonic phenotype indicating that SR proteins are not redundant . However , these essential functions appear to be tissue - or developmental stage - speciﬁc , as cultured cells from the knockout mice are viable . The generation of conditional knockouts has allowed further characterization of SR protein function in different tissue types or at various developmental time points . Deletion of SC35 in mice results in decreased thymus size and a major defect in T - cell maturation [ 136 ] , whereas tissue - speciﬁc ablation of SC35 in the heart has been shown to cause dilated cardiomyopathy [ 137 ] . SF2 / ASF has also been shown to have a role in cardiac function ; however its main function is in the developmental process of postnatal heart remodelling [ 138 ] . Mice knockouts of other splicing factors , including Nova , U2AF26 , hnRNP U and hnRNP C , also result in embryonic lethality or developmental defects , which highlights the importance of splicing for the correct regulation of biological processes such as embryogenesis and tissue maintenance [ 134 ] . POST - SPLICING ACTIVITIES OF SR PROTEINS SR proteins also function in mRNA processing reactions that occur after splicing , including mRNA nuclear export , NMD ( non - sense - mediated decay ) and translation ( reviewed in [ 139 ] ) . SR proteins display a nuclear localization pattern and are found to accumulate in splicing speckles [ 140 ] . However , a subset of SR proteins , which includes SF2 / ASF , SRp20 and 9G8 , shuttle continuously between the nucleus and the cytoplasm [ 141 ] , reminiscent of what was found for a subset of hnRNP proteins [ 142 ] . This suggested that the shuttling SR proteins may function in cytoplasmic processes , or be involved in the transport of spliced mRNA . Indeed , SRp20 , 9G8 and SF2 / ASF function in the nucleocytoplasmic export of mRNA by interacting with the mRNA nuclear export receptor TAP / NFX1 [ 143 , 144 ] , exhibiting a higher afﬁnity when hypophosphorylated [ 145 ] . SR proteins have also been implicated in regulating the NMD pathway , whereby mRNAs containing premature termination codons are targeted for degradation . Increased expression of a subset of SR proteins , including SF2 / ASF , SC35 , SRp40 and SRp55 , strongly enhanced NMD [ 146 ] . Interestingly , this effect does not appear to be dependent on their nucleocytoplasmic shuttling , suggesting a role for SR proteins in enhancing nuclear steps of NMD . A recent study showed that SF2 / ASF has the poten - tial to affect the cellular site of NMD , shifting this process to the nuclear compartment before mRNA release from nuclei [ 147 ] . SF2 / ASF controls alternative splicing of pre - mRNAs encoding the kinases MNK2 [ MAPK ( mitogen - activated protein kinase ) - interacting kinase 2 ] and S6K1 ( S6 kinase 1 ) that are involved in translational regulation . Increased expression of SF2 / ASF results in the production of an isoform of MNK2 , which promotes MAPK - independent eIF4E ( eukaryotic initiation factor 4E ) phos - phorylation , and an unusual oncogenic isoform of S6K1 , thereby enhancing cap - dependent translation [ 148 ] . SR proteins have also been shown to directly affect translational regulation . SF2 / ASF associates with polyribosomes in cytoplasmic extracts and enhances the translation of an ESE - containing luciferase reporter both in vivo and in vitro [ 149 ] . This direct effect of SF2 / ASF in the regulation of the translation of SF2 / ASF - bound mRNA targets is mediated by the recruitment of components of the mTOR ( mammalian target of rapamycin ) signalling pathway , resulting in phosphorylation and release of 4E - BP , a competitive inhibitor of cap - dependent translation [ 150 ] . The role of mTOR in the activation of S6K1 , which phosphorylates eIF4B and S6 , promoting translation initiation , may also be enhanced by SF2 / ASF [ 151 ] ( Figure 3 ) . Other SR proteins have also been reported to function in translation . SRp20 has been shown to function in IRES ( internal ribosome entry site ) - mediated translation of a viral RNA [ 152 ] , whereas 9G8 plays a role in translation of unspliced mRNA containing a CTE ( constitutive transport element ) [ 153 ] . The results described in this section demonstrate that SR protein function is not restricted to nuclear mRNA splicing , and it seems sensible that proteins already bound to spliced mRNA may function in subsequent processing events as they are already in place to facilitate future interactions . However , it also highlights the requirement for exquisite regulation of SR proteins in order to maintain their role in cytoplasmic processing of mRNAs without disrupting nuclear processes , which are highly sensitive to the relative concentration of splicing factors . SR PROTEIN REGULATION A dynamic cycle of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is required for pre - mRNA splicing [ 154 ] , this being related , at least in part , to the phosphorylation status of SR proteins . The RS domain of SR proteins is extensively phosphorylated on serine residues and this plays an important role in regulating the sub - cellular localization and activity of SR proteins ( reviewed in [ 40 ] ) . For instance , phosphorylation of the RS domain in SF2 / ASF acts to enhance protein – protein interactions with other RS domain - containing splicing factors , such as U1 - 70K [ 155 ] , whereas dephosphorylation of SR and SR - related proteins is required for splicing catalysis to proceed [ 156 , 157 ] . c (cid:3) The Authors Journal compilation c (cid:3) 2009 Biochemical Society Functional roles of SR proteins in RNA processing 21 Figure 3 Role of SF2 / ASF in translation SF2 / ASF - bound mRNAs recruit the mTOR kinase resulting in the phosphorylation and release of 4E - BP , leading to in enhanced translation initiation . The mTOR kinase phosphorylates S6K1 , which promotes translation initiation , and this may also be enhanced by SF2 / ASF . The Mnk2b isoform induced by SF2 / ASF - dependent alternative splicing also leads to translation activation . Several protein kinase families have been shown to phos - phorylate the RS domain of SR proteins , including the SRPK ( SR protein kinase ) family [ 158 , 159 ] , the Clk / Sty family of dual - speciﬁcity kinases [ 160 ] and topoisomerase I [ 161 ] . SRPK1 is a serine - speciﬁc kinase that binds to a ‘docking motif’ in SF2 / ASF that restricts phosphorylation to the N - terminus of the RS domain [ 162 ] . In contrast , Clk / Sty can phosphorylate the whole of the RS domain , resulting in a hyperphosphorylated state [ 163 ] . The phos - phorylation status of the RS domain of SR proteins is also important in the post - splicing activities of SR proteins . A hypo - phosphorylated RS domain is required for the interaction of nuc - leocytoplasmic shuttling SR proteins with the TAP / NFX1 nuclear export receptor [ 145 ] . SR protein kinases present in the cytoplasm are required to re - phosphorylate the RS domain before the SR protein can return to the nucleus [ 164 ] . RS domain dephosphoryl - ation also plays an important role in sorting SR proteins in the nucleus , where shuttling SR proteins and non - shuttling SR pro - teins are recycled via different pathways [ 165 ] . In the cytoplasm , dephosphorylation of the RS domain enhances mRNA binding of SF2 / ASFandcontributestoitsroleintranslation [ 166 ] . SRprotein phosphorylation is also important in developmental regulation , as demonstrated in the nematode Ascaris lumbricoides [ 167 ] . Importantly , alternative splicing is extensively regulated by signal transduction pathways , whereby signalling cascades can link the splicing machinery to the exterior environment [ 168 ] . For instance , the SR protein SRp38 is dephosphorylated upon heat shock by the phosphatase PP1 and becomes a potent splicing repressor [ 169 , 170 ] . Two other well described examples are the insulin - induced promotion of protein kinase C beta II alternative splicing as a result of SRp40 phosphorylation by Akt [ 171 ] , and the growth factor induced alternative splicing of the ﬁbronectin EDA exon , via phosphorylation of SF2 / ASF and 9G8 by Akt [ 172 ] . Interestingly , growth factors not only modify the alternative splicing pattern of the ﬁbronectin gene but also affect its trans - lation in an SR protein - dependent fashion , providing an example where modiﬁcation of SR protein activity in response to extra - cellular stimulation leads to a concerted regulation of splicing and translation [ 173 ] . Caffeine regulates the alternative splicing of a subset of cancer - associated genes , including the tumor suppressor KLF6 . This response is mediated by the SR protein , SC35 , which is in turn induced by caffeine , and its overexpression is sufﬁcient to recapitulate this regulated event [ 174 ] . Another example of the tight regulation of the SR protein family members is exempliﬁed by the common existence of unproductive splicing of SR genes . This is associated with ultraconserved elements that overlap alter - natively spliced exons and target the resulting mRNAs for degradation by NMD [ 175 , 176 ] . SR PROTEINS AND HUMAN DISEASE Disruption of the many roles of SR family proteins can lead to human disease . Approximately 15 % of mutations that cause ge - netic disease affect pre - mRNA splicing [ 177 ] , targeting conserved splicing signals including the 5 (cid:2) ss , 3 (cid:2) ss and BP , as well as enhancer and silencer sequences . Indeed , analysis of a database of 50 single - base substitutions associated with exon - skipping in human genes revealed that more than 50 % of these mutations disrupted at least one of the target motifs for the SR proteins SF2 / ASF , SRp40 , SRp55andSC35 [ 178 , 179 ] ( reviewedin [ 180 ] ) . Cancer There is emerging evidence that establishes a connection between the mis - expression of SR proteins and the development of can - cerous tissues , mainly as a result of change in the alternative splicing patterns of key transcripts . Increased expression of SR proteins usually correlates with cancer progression , as shown by elevated expression of SF2 / ASF , SC35 and SRp20 in malignant ovarian tissue [ 181 ] and of several classical SR proteins in breast cancer [ 182 ] . However , the mRNA levels of SF2 / ASF , SRp40 , SRp55 and SRp75 are lower in non - familial colon adenocarcino - mas than adjacent non - pathological tissue , suggesting the levels of SR proteins in cancerous tissues may be tissue - speciﬁc [ 183 ] . SF2 / ASF was found to be upregulated in several human tu - mours , including lung , colon , kidney , liver , pancreas and breast tumours [ 148 ] . Accordingly , gene ampliﬁcation of SFRS1 , which c (cid:3) The Authors Journal compilation c (cid:3) 2009 Biochemical Society 22 J . C . Long and J . F . Caceres codes for SF2 / ASF , is commonly found in breast cancers [ 184 ] . Furthermore , increased expression of SF2 / ASF transforms immortal rodent ﬁbroblasts and leads to the formation of sarcomas in nude mice , whereas downregulation of SF2 / ASF reverses these phenotypes . Other SR proteins , such as SC35 and SRp55 , did not have transforming activity , indicating a highly speciﬁc role of SF2 / ASF in cancer development . Altogether , these results support the notion that SFRS1 is a proto - oncogene [ 148 ] . Another RNA target for SF2 / ASF that can explain its transforming activity is the proto - oncogene Ron ( macrophage - stimulating 1 receptor ) . SF2 / ASF regulates the alternative splicing of Ron pre - mRNA by binding to an ESE in exon 12 and promoting skipping of exon 11 [ 185 ] . This results in production of (cid:4) Ron , a constitutively active isoform which confers increased motility on expressing cells , a characteristic required for tumour metastasis . Importantly , abnormal accumulation of (cid:4) Ron occurs in breast and colon tumours and the levels of SF2 / ASF mirror those of (cid:4) Ron [ 185 ] . HIV HIV - 1 uses a combination of several alternative 5 (cid:2) and 3 (cid:2) ss to generate more than 40 different mRNAs from its full - length genomic pre - mRNA [ 186 ] . Several SR proteins have been shown to regulate different splicing events affecting the viral transcripts . For instance , SRp75 binds a viral ESE [ 187 ] , whereas SF2 / ASF and SRp40 bind a guanosine - adenosine - rich ESE identiﬁed in exon 5 of HIV - 1 leading to its inclusion [ 188 ] . Furthermore , HIV infection induces changes in the levels of splicing factors , including SR proteins , that regulate viral alternative splicing and therefore virus replication [ 189 ] . Current drugs used to treat HIV - infected patients involve the use of combinations of retrovirals that speciﬁcally target viral proteins such as reverse transcrip - tase , protease and gp120 ( reviewed by [ 190 ] ) . HIV viral produc - tion is tightly linked with alternative splicing of the viral HIV - 1 pre - mRNA . Therefore , an alternative and novel approach to cir - cumvent the problem of resistance of HIV - 1 to current inhibitors is to target the role of SR proteins in HIV pre - mRNA splicing [ 191 ] . A screen for chemical inhibitors of pre - mRNA splicing identiﬁed indole derivatives that speciﬁcally inhibit ESE - dependent splicing by interacting directly and selectively with individual SR proteins [ 192 ] . One such small chemical compound was shown to prevent the production of key viral HIV - 1 regulatory proteins whose splicing depends on weak 3 (cid:2) ss [ 193 ] . SMA ( spinal muscular atrophy ) SMA is a severe hereditary neurodegenerative disorder that results from the lack of a functional SMN1 ( survival of motor neuron 1 ) gene product , which is a key component of the snRNP biogenesis pathway . An SMN1 paralogue , the centromeric SMN2 gene , differs by a single nucleotide change , a C > T transition in exon 7 , that causes substantial skipping of this exon and results in the production of a non - functional protein . This exon - skipping event has been attributed either to the loss of an SF2 / ASF - dependent exonic splicing enhancer [ 194 ] or to the creation of an hnRNP A / B - dependent exonic splicing silencer [ 195 ] . Several therapeutic approaches , which focus on altering the splicing of SMN2 to induce exon 7 inclusion and would result in functional SMN protein in affected patients , have made use of antisense technology [ 196 ] . The ﬁrst uses bifunctional ASOs ( antisense oligonucleotides ) which are comprised of oligonuc - leotides complementary to exon 7 , with a non - complementary tail containing exonic - splicing enhancer motifs recognized by SR proteins . This approach has been shown to mediate the binding of SF2 / ASF to SMN2 exon 7 and promote exon inclusion [ 197 ] . An alternative strategy has recently been developed based on bifunctional U7 snRNAs that contain both an antisense sequence targeting exon 7 and a splicing enhancer sequence to improve recognition of the exon . These RNAs are stably introduced into cells and the U7 snRNAs become incorporated into snRNPs , inducing a prolonged restoration of SMN protein in SMA ﬁbro - blasts [ 198 ] . Another approach uses ESSENCE ( exon - speciﬁc splicing enhancement by small chimaeric effectors ) molecules , which also contain an antisense moiety complementary to the target exon and a minimal RS domain peptide designed to mimic the effect of SR proteins . The ESSENCE molecules have also been shown to restore SMN2 levels to that of wild - type SMN1 levels by exon inclusion [ 199 ] . Interestingly , the antisense moiety alone stimulated exon 7 inclusion , and functional full - length SMN protein was produced in primary ﬁbroblasts from a type I SMA patient [ 200 , 201 ] . An in vivo delivery system has been developed for bifunctional RNAs using a viral vector [ 202 ] . Other human diseases It has been demonstrated that SR proteins are autoantigens in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [ 203 ] . SR family proteins have also been shown to have regulatory roles in the splicing of several pre - mRNAs associated with human disease . For example , SF2 / ASF and SRp40 bind to an ISS and promote exclusion of exon 9 of CFTR ( cystic ﬁbrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ) [ 204 ] . Lack of exon 9 correlates with the occurrence of monosymptomatic and full forms of cystic ﬁbrosis disease [ 205 ] . SC35 has a role in the aberrant splicing of the E1 α PDH ( E1 α pyruvate dehydrogenase ) mRNA , resulting in a defect of mitochondrial energy metabolism . An intronic mutation of the E1 α PDH gene that activates a cryptic 5 (cid:2) ss leads to mis - spliced mRNA and defective protein [ 206 ] . SC35 has been shown to signiﬁcantly activate splicing at this cryptic site . Accordingly , RNAi - mediated depletion of SC35 in primary ﬁbroblasts from the affected patient could restore the normal E1 α PDH splicing pattern [ 207 ] . It has also been recently reported that the expression of SRp20 is elevated in bipolar patients , which may explain the aberrant splicing of glucocorticoid receptor α in these patients [ 208 ] . CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES This article has reviewed the many roles of SR proteins in gene expression . An obvious question is , why are SR proteins involved in so many cellular functions ? These are very abundant nuclear proteins and a subset of them shuttle to the cytoplasm where they are involved in NMD and translation regulation . Their function in different biochemical activities may underlie the extensive network of coupling amongst gene expression machines [ 209 ] . It should be noted that SR proteins are not the only proteins coupling nuclear and cytoplamic RNA processing events , since the EJC ( exon junction complex ) , a multiprotein complex deposited as a consequence of pre - mRNA splicing , links pre - mRNA splicing with mRNA export , NMD and translation ( reviewed in [ 210 ] ) . Individual SR proteins regulate subsets of pre - mRNAs via spli - cing in the nucleus and post - splicing processes in the cytoplasm . The next few years will see considerable efforts to identify physio - logical RNA targets of SR proteins and gain a better understanding of the many cellular functions of these master regulators of RNA processing .
