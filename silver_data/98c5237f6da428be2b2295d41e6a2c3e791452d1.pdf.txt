We utilized mouse community curated resources to set up an automated screen to discover novel testable gene function hypotheses . Using 11 , 832 community contributed strain - differentiating experiments and trait presence / absence scoring , we searched for all experiments where strains can be split by their phenotypic values ( e . g . , high vs . low responders ) . Then , using 48 sequenced strains , we found one or more candidate gene for each experiment where homozygous high - impact variants ( such as stopgain , frameshifts ) segregate strains into these same binary grouping . Our approach rediscovered 212 known gene - phenotype relationships , almost always highlighting potentially novel causal variants , as well as thousands of gene function hypotheses . To help find the most exciting hypotheses , we improved the state of the art in machine learning driven literature - based discovery ( LBD ) . Reading on our top 3 ranked candidate genes per experiment reveals 80 % of rediscovered relationships , compared to 5 % reading at random . We proposed 1 , 842 novel gene - phenotype testable hypotheses using our approach . We built a web portal at aimhigh . stanford . edu to allow researchers to view all our testable hypotheses in detail . Our open - source code can be rerun as more sequenced strains and phenotyping experiments become available . 3 Introduction Mouse is one of the most widely used model organisms in genetics . Countless biomedical discoveries have been made initially with the mouse model 1 . Inbred laboratory mouse strains are populations of mice that have reached intra - strain genetic homogeneity from at least 20 generations of sibling mating 2 , 3 . Through generations of inbreeding , each strain has developed unique variants and phenotypes . These carefully maintained populations of mice are expected to be homozygous in most genetic loci , helping expose many recessive inherited traits . The mouse community has been accumulating a wide range of functional information about mouse genes gained from mouse model experiments . Mouse Genome Database 4 ( MGD ) has been at the forefront of curating and organizing this data . They developed Mammalian Phenotype ( MP ) ontology 5 , which is a structured dictionary of terms that represent various phenotypes observed in mice . Having a controlled set of terms allows for easy and consistent comparisons across annotations . Inbred mouse strains are often phenotypically and genotypically diverse 6 , 7 , and many experiments have been performed on these strains to measure their phenotypic diversity . Mouse Phenome Database 8 ( MPD ) has curated and publicly released the results of thousands of such experiments deposited from various laboratories covering many different inbred strains . In addition , MGD has annotated naturally occurring phenotypes in multiple strains . These phenotypes vary widely , ranging from quantitative phenotypes such as time spent in a maze to categorical phenotypes such as coat color . Here , we analyzed whole genome sequencing data of 48 mouse inbred strains in search of high - impact homozygous variants that segregate concordantly to each phenotypic measure . We then used annotations of causative genes established through knockout experiments to find previously known proof of principle gene - phenotype relationships in our set . To help propose the most exciting hypotheses from a set of novel candidates , we built a literature - based discovery ( LBD ) 9 , 10 classifier trained to predict future single - gene mouse knockout results from clues in the current literature . Our entire pipeline is outlined in Figure 1 . Finally , we offer an easy - to - use web interface to display full details of our hypotheses at : aimhigh . stanford . edu . 4 Materials and Methods Mouse strains We used whole genome data of 48 inbred mouse strains in our analysis : C57BL / 6J , 129P2 / OlaHsd , 129S1 / SvImJ , 129S5 / SvEvBrd , AKR / J , A / J , B10 .

Our reference strain is C57BL / 6J ( the “Black 6” mouse ) and our reference genome assembly for all variant calls is GRCm38 / mm10 . Phenotype data Inbred mouse phenotype data Mouse Phenome Database ( MPD ) 8 is a repository of experimental phenotypic data measured on various mouse inbred strains in different laboratories . We downloaded the animaldatapoints . csv . gz , strainmeans . csv . gz , and ontology _ mappings . csv files on March 28 , 2022 from https : / / phenome . jax . org / downloads . We kept all experiments e when at least 6 of our 48 sequenced strains were phenotyped , and the reported trait is relevant for genetic dissection ( e . g . , we removed experiment MPD : 36680 reporting “age of mice at testing” ) . In addition , 14 out of our 48 sequenced strains had at least 1 strain - specific , naturally occurring , spontaneous phenotype annotated in MGD 4 ( e . g . , A / J mice spontaneously develop cochlear hair cell degeneration ) . For each phenotype , we labeled strains annotated with the phenotype 1 and strains not annotated with the phenotype 0 . These phenotypes were added to experiments ( Figure 1 ) . Phenotype separation boundaries For each experiment e , we sought a phenotype separation boundary b that separates strains into two groups based on their phenotypic values . All strains used in the study are considered for the purpose of binarization , including strains that we do not have genomes for . Most MPD 5 experiments reported biological replicate values , but some reported only the average and the standard deviation across replicates . We handle these two cases separately : Experiments with replicate values : To remove any outliers , we discarded the top and bottom 25 percentile biological replicates for strains with more than 5 replicates . The strains were sorted by the average of the remaining biological replicates . Any boundary grouping that sorted strains into “left” vs “right” was recorded as separable if the following conditions were met : ( 1 ) the maximum replicate value in the “left” group is smaller than the minimum replicate value in the “right” group ( 2 ) the difference between the two values is greater than twice the average standard deviation of the two strains 11 ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . Experiments without replicate values : The strains were sorted by the reported average of the biological replicates . For every strain in the sorted order , we recorded a phenotype separation boundary between the strain and the next adjacent strain if : ( 1 ) the strain’s average value plus its standard deviation was less than the next strain’s average value minus its standard deviation ; ( 2 ) the difference between these two values is greater than twice the average standard deviation of the two strains . This resulted in each experiment having zero , one , or multiple possible phenotype separation boundaries . Each boundary was considered independently in candidate gene matching . Genotype data Whole genome variant calling The raw reads of 48 strains were trimmed , filtered , and aligned to the reference genome ( C57BL / 6J , GRCm38 / mm10 ) using Burrows - Wheeler Aligner ( BWA ) 12 with default settings . Then the reads were realigned and recalibrated around indels using GATK ( v3 . 6 ) 13 with default parameters . Single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) and insertion or deletions ( indels ) discovery were performed using BCFtools ( v1 . 9 ) 14 command : “bcftools mpileup - a DP , AD , ADF , ADR , SP , INFO / AD - E - F0 . 25 - Q0 - p - m3 - d500” . Joint calling was performed on 47 strains ( against the reference C57BL / 6J strain ) using : “bcftools call - mv - f GQ , GP” . Indels were then left - aligned and normalized using : “bcftools norm - d none - s - m + indels” . Low quality variants were filtered out using : “bcftools view - i ‘MIN ( FMT / DP ) > 3 & MIN ( FMT / GQ ) > 20’” and 6 “bcftools filter - g3 - G10” . Strain - specific variant filtering We used Phred quality scores 15 to measure variant call quality per strain . We required that the most confident call be at least 100 times more likely than the second most confident call ( i . e . , Phred score difference of at least 20 ) . We marked the variant call for the strain as inconclusive if the gap was smaller than 20 . While inbred mice are bred to homogenize as many of their alleles as possible , we kept any high - quality heterozygous calls as heterozygous . Comparing and supplementing our sequencing data with a published dataset Mouse Genome Project ( MGP ) 16 publishes various mouse genetic variations including SNPs and Indels from 37 of our 48 inbred strains . Using their FTP site , we downloaded their SNP and Indels VCF on March 04 , 2021 ( ftp : / / ftp - mouse . sanger . ac . uk / REL - 2004 - v7 - SNPs _ Indels / mgp _ REL2005 _ snps _ indels . vcf . gz ) . All variants included had already gone through quality filtering . We applied the same Phred quality score filtering to find only the conclusive calls for each strain . After comparing the two sets , we replaced our inconclusive calls with MGP’s conclusive calls . Annotating variants with Ensembl VEP We annotated each variant using Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor ( VEP ) 17 . VEP tags each input variant with expected consequences of all relevant transcripts . We downloaded the newest version 102 . 0 for mm10 on February 24 , 2021 . To remove any ambiguous calls due to alignment orientation , we ran VEP using both left and right alignments on our mouse strain variant call format ( VCF ) files . We performed left alignment using GATK’s LeftAlignAndTrimVariants tool and the mm10 Fasta sequence file downloaded on March 01 , 2021 from : https : / / hgdownload . soe . ucsc . edu / goldenPath / mm10 / bigZips / chromFa . tar . gz . GATK’s left alignment tool requires index and dictionary files for these Fasta files . We ran samtools faidx command to make the index files . We downloaded picard . jar version 2 . 25 . 4 from https : / / broadinstitute . github . io / picard / on March 06 , 2021 and ran the following command to make the dictionary files : java - jar picard . jar CreateSequenceDictionary R = chr * . fa O = chr * . dict 7 Then , using the sequence Fasta files with their index and dictionary files and our VCF files as inputs , we ran the following command to make left aligned VCF files : gatk LeftAlignAndTrimVariants - R chr * . fa - V chr * . vcf - o chr * _ left _ aligned . vcf We used the VEP Docker image to annotate our VCFs . We ran VEP once with our GATK left aligned VCF for left aligned annotations and once with our original VCF with VEP’s – shift _ genomic flag set to True for right aligned annotations . Gene set We built a gene set from GENCODE VM32 known genes downloaded from the UCSC Table Browser 18 on March 01 , 2021 . We removed all transcripts that do not have a coding sequence that starts with a start codon ( ATG ) and ends with a stop codon ( TAA , TAG , and TGA ) . Genes with high - impact variants We kept a variant if and only if it was tagged with a high - impact consequence to any transcript in our gene set by VEP using both left and right alignments ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) . High - impact consequences defined in the VEP documentation are : transcript ablation , splice acceptor variant , splice donor variant , stop gained , frameshift variant , stop lost , start lost , and transcript amplification . VEP annotates each variant independently . To account for adjacent SNPs affecting the same codon , we performed a post processing step to check if the final amino acid resulting from the effect of all SNPs would indeed result in a high - impact change . Finally , we removed any high - impact variants in predicted genes , RIKEN genes , Olfactory and Vomeronasal genes . We represented all genes using NCBI gene IDs . Building candidate sets For each separable boundary b derived from the phenotypic experiment e , we searched for concordant genotype separations for each highly - impacted genes . We merged the genotypes per strain per gene g across transcripts and variants ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) : homozygous reference strain : has no homozygous or heterozygous high - impact alternate allele . homozygous alternate strain : has at least 1 homozygous high - impact alternate allele . heterozygous alternate strain : has at least 1 heterozygous high - impact alternate allele and no homozygous high - impact alternate allele . 8 inconclusive strain : has at least 1 inconclusive gap or low - quality allele that may be high - impact and has no homozygous or heterozygous high - impact alternate allele . unsequenced strain : not one of our 48 sequenced strains . A candidate gene g is a match for experiment e with boundary b , if the following conditions are met : ( 1 ) all homozygous alternate strains and all homozygous reference strains are separated by b , ( 2 ) both sides of b have at least one homozygous strain , ( 3 ) there are at least 6 total homozygous strains between the two groups , and ( 4 ) all heterozygous alternate strains are on one side of b . Any unsequenced strains or inconclusive strains can appear on either side of b ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) . All matching experiment e , boundary b , gene g , ( e , b , g ) triplets form our trait - specific candidate set . Validating against known causative gene - phenotype relationships We searched for known gene - phenotype relationships in our candidate set as proof of principle to our approach . We used Mammalian Phenotype ( MP ) 5 , an ontology of phenotypes observed in mice , to find matches . For each experiment e , we obtained one or more MP terms Φ 𝑒 , denoting the phenotype measured in e from the experiment source ( MPD or MGD ) . For each gene g , we obtained a set of zero or more MP terms Φ 𝑔 , denoting the phenotype annotations supported by single gene knockouts from MGD . Φ 𝑔 for all available genes were downloaded on April 26 , 2021 through http : / / www . informatics . jax . org / downloads / reports / MGI _ PhenoGenoMP . rpt . For each trait - specific candidate ( e , b , g ) we generated , we first asked whether | Φ 𝑒 ∩ Φ 𝑔 | > 0 , which implies a known causal relation between e and g . All such matches are listed in Table 1 , and they represent cases where our candidate gene has already been shown to underlie the measured trait in experiment e . MP terms are organized in a hierarchical structure where a lower , more specific term ( i . e . , descendant terms , 𝐷 ( Φ ) ) is implied by its higher , more general term . Since the experiments measure a spectrum of phenotypes across different strains , they are often tagged with a more general term than the gene . As an example , the experiment MPD : 22970 is tagged with “abnormal mean corpuscular volume ( MP : 0000226 ) ” , whereas its candidate gene Foxp3 is tagged with the more specific descendant term “increased mean corpuscular volume 9 ( MP : 0002590 ) ” . To benefit from this hierarchical structure , we also listed additional positive controls | Φ 𝑒 ∩ 𝐷 ( Φ 𝑔 ) | > 0 in Table 2 . Literature - based discovery ( LBD ) classifier Motivation Encouragingly , over 200 gene - phenotype relationships from our trait - specific candidate sets were previously known ( Figure 1 ) . This indicates our method is effective in discovering true relationships . At the same time , thousands of our gene - phenotype hypotheses currently have no reported causative relationship , suggesting many exciting hypotheses yet to be discovered . Some of our experiments yielded very few novel candidate genes . Table 3 holds a sample of experiments with fewer than 10 candidate genes . The remaining experiments each have as many as 103 candidate genes . To build a small set with compelling evidence for further investigation , a researcher would need to carefully read literature on all candidate genes we matched in each experimental context . To mimic the process , we devised a supervised Machine Learning ( ML ) approach to predict which gene - phenotype relationships would become true in a few years based on existing literature evidence . Briefly , we trained a ML classifier to learn patterns from literature up to year T 0 to be predictive of gene - phenotype relationships that were discovered later at some time T 1 . We used the trained classifier to prioritize the most promising novel candidates for each mouse inbred strain experiment e ( Supplementary Figure 4A ) . Exciting examples are shown in Table 4 . MeSH - publication relationships We used PubMed , a database of over 33 million peer - reviewed biomedical publications , as our literature source . They key topics mentioned in PubMed papers are manually indexed using the Medical Subject Heading ( MeSH ) ontology 19 , 20 . These topics include functional annotations but not gene mentions . Similar to MP , MeSH is also organized in a hierarchical structure with descendant terms are implied in the ancestor terms . For example , “Microcephaly ( D008831 ) ” is a descendant of “Disease ( D004194 ) ” . MeSH term annotations per paper ( in PubMed ID , or PMID ) were downloaded from https : / / ftp . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / pubmed / baseline / on April 12 , 2022 . 10 Gene - publication relationships We downloaded mentions of genes in each PubMed abstract from Pubtator Central 21 . Pubtator Central 21 is a natural language processing ( NLP ) tool that tags PubMed papers with recognized entities such as genes . The mappings between genes ( in NCBI ID ) and abstracts ( in PMID ) were downloaded using https : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / research / pubtator - api / on April 12 , 2022 . Publication graph To encode relatedness , we built a publication graph where a node is either a MeSH term or a gene . We extended an undirected edge between any two nodes ( MeSH - gene , gene - gene , or MeSH - MeSH ) if there is at least one paper that mentions them together ( Supplementary Figure 4B ) . Setting up the learning task Our supervised learning task requires a set of labeled examples ( positive or negative ) and a learning algorithm . Each example is represented by a set of scalar values ( i . e . , features ) . Single - gene knockout positive set We trained our ML classifier on positive examples derived from papers that describe the phenotypic impact discovered in single - gene mouse knockout ( KO ) experiments . A single - gene mouse knockout paper is tagged as a knockout of exactly one gene in MGD and tagged with a MeSH term , “Mice , Knockout ( D018345 ) ” in PubMed . We downloaded these papers from MGD’s MouseMine API ( https : / / www . mousemine . org / mousemine / begin . do ) on April 12 , 2022 . Each single - gene g KO paper was tagged with one or more phenotype MeSH terms m to build a set of ( g , m ) pairs . Given all the literature evidence at time T 0 , we aim to predict which ( g , m ) pairs would be discovered at some later time T 1 ( Supplementary Figure 4A , C ) . Building retrospective single KO train and test sets To propose plausible ( g , m ) pairs for future discovery , we used the open discovery “ABC” method 22 , 23 . For a node A in our graph , we found nodes , C , that are linked at T 0 by one or more intermediary node B ( i . e . , A - B and C - B edges ) to A but have no direct A - C link . All A - C links are candidates for discovery at T 1 . To perform retrospective analysis , we built a time - specific 11 publication graph using papers published up to T 0 and compared it against a publication graph at T 0 + 5 ( Supplementary Figure 4C ) . We used two publication graphs to train our model : the 2010 graph ( i . e . , T 0 ) and the 2015 ( i . e . , T 0 + 5 ) graph . We found ( g , m ) pairs mapped to single - gene knockout publications published between ( 2010 , 2015 ] . We discarded a ( g , m ) pair if any of the following was true : ( 1 ) g and m were directly linked in the 2010 graph , ( 2 ) either g or m were not found in the 2010 graph , or ( 3 ) g and m did not share an intermediate node in the 2010 graph . The remaining pairs are our positive examples . We added negative examples ( i . e . , ( g , m ) pair not discovered by 2015 ) for each MeSH term m that is part of at least 1 positive example . A ( g , m ) pair is a negative example if the following conditions were met : ( 1 ) g is a mouse protein - coding gene from our gene set found in the 2010 graph , ( 2 ) g shares at least 1 intermediate node with m in the 2010 graph , and ( 3 ) g does not have a direct link to m in the 2010 and the 2015 graph . We repeated the same operations with the 2015 graph and the 2020 graph to test our algorithm ( Supplementary Figure 4A , Figure 2A ) . Open discovery resulted in thousands of negative examples for each positive example ( see results ) , making ranking the positive examples on top a challenging task . Building rediscovered test set and candidate hypothesis prediction set Because we matched genomic signatures to phenotypic separations , our actual sets of candidate genes are orders of magnitude smaller . To assess the performance of our algorithm on our set of novel hypotheses , we applied it to our set of rediscovered hypotheses ( Supplementary Figure 4A , Figure 2B ) . Then we applied the method to our novel candidates to prioritize the most exciting hypotheses ( Table 4 ) . Since PubMed uses MeSH terms to annotate papers , we mapped each phenotypic experiment e to zero or more MeSH terms m that denote the phenotype measured in e . From our rediscovered test set ( Tables 1 and 2 , see Figure 1 ) , we selected a set of experiment e and boundary b that has at least 10 candidate genes . From this set , we searched for positive ( g , m ) pairs where g and m only shared intermediate nodes in 2015 but were 12 directly linked in the 2020 graph . All non - positive ( g , m ) pairs from the same experiment e and boundary b were labeled negative ( Supplementary Figure 4A , Rediscovered single KO test set ) . Finally , our candidate hypothesis prediction set contained novel ( g , m ) pairs that as of July 2022 have no known relationship in MP or MeSH ( Supplementary Figure 4A , Candidate hypothesis prediction set ) . Classifier features We used the publication graph to provide the classifier a set of features ( i . e . , clues ) that represent each gene g , MeSH term m , ( g , m ) pairs in our sets . We used the appropriate time - specific publication graphs to build these features . For example , we used the 2010 graph to build features to predict relationship status in 2015 . We first define these terms for node u and v ( MeSH term or gene ) in our publication graph to help explain each feature : Neighbors of u : 𝑁 ( 𝑢 ) = 𝑠𝑒𝑡 𝑜𝑓 nodes directly connected to u Degree of u : 𝑑 ( 𝑢 ) = | 𝑁 ( 𝑢 ) | Publications of u : 𝑝 ( 𝑢 ) = publications that mention 𝑢 Weight of an edge connecting u and v : 𝑤 ( 𝑢 , 𝑣 ) = ∑ 𝑝𝑎𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 ( 𝑖 ) 𝑝 ( 𝑢 ) ∩ 𝑝 ( 𝑣 ) 𝑖 Paper score of i : 𝑝𝑎𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 ( 𝑖 ) = 1 𝐺 ( 𝑖 ) , 𝐺 ( 𝑖 ) = 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒 𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑒𝑑 𝑖𝑛 𝑖 The following features are used in our classifier : Degree of the gene : 𝑑 ( 𝑔 ) ( number of nodes directly connected to g ) Common neighbor 24 : | 𝑁 ( 𝑔 ) ∩ 𝑁 ( 𝑚 ) | ( number of nodes directly connected to g and m ) Adamic Adar 25 : ∑ 1 log ( 𝑑 ( 𝑛 ) ) 𝑁 ( 𝑔 ) ∩ 𝑁 ( 𝑚 ) 𝑛 ( sum over the inverse log of number of nodes directly connected to shared neighbors of g and m ) Preferential attachment 24 : 𝑑 ( 𝑔 ) ∗ 𝑑 ( 𝑚 ) ( number nodes directly connected to g times number nodes directly connected to m ) Gene publications : ∑ 𝑝𝑎𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 ( 𝑖 ) 𝑝 ( 𝑔 ) 𝑖 Human ortholog link : The weight of the edge between m and g ’s human ortholog . Orthologous relationships are defined by Ensembl 102 , latest version with mm10 , downloaded from http : / / nov2020 . archive . ensembl . org / biomart / martview / on September 3 , 2021 . If there 13 were multiple orthologs then the average value is used , and if there is no direct edge or there is no human ortholog in the graph then we assign ( - 1 ) . BITOLA confidence 26 : ∑ 𝑤 ( 𝑚 , 𝑛 ) ∑ 𝑝𝑎𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 ( 𝑖 ) 𝑝 ( 𝑚 ) 𝑖 ∗ 𝑤 ( 𝑛 , 𝑔 ) ∑ 𝑝𝑎𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 ( 𝑖 ) 𝑝 ( 𝑛 ) 𝑖 𝑁 ( 𝑔 ) ∩ 𝑁 ( 𝑚 ) 𝑛 Reverse BITOLA confidence : ∑ 𝑤 ( 𝑚 , 𝑛 ) ∑ 𝑝𝑎𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 ( 𝑖 ) 𝑝 ( 𝑛 ) 𝑖 ∗ 𝑤 ( 𝑛 , 𝑔 ) ∑ 𝑝𝑎𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 ( 𝑖 ) 𝑝 ( 𝑔 ) 𝑖 𝑁 ( 𝑔 ) ∩ 𝑁 ( 𝑚 ) 𝑛 MeSH term’s gene neighbors : the number of genes directly mentioned with m . Mean expression : find top 5 anatomical entities ( i . e . , descendant MeSH terms of “Anatomy ( D000715 ) ” such as “Brain ( D001921 ) ” ) that are most often co - mentioned with m . Then take the average of the Adamic Adar scores between the top 5 anatomical entities and g . Classifier model We used a Gradient Boosting Tree Classifier 27 to assign scores to each example . The score is a number ranging from 0 to 1 , and a higher number indicates the example is more likely to be positive . Gradient Boosting Trees is a supervised method which means it is presented with a large number of labeled examples ( i . e . , training set ) and it learns to distinguish the two labels by minimizing the final entropy . It is an ensemble method that involves a series of decision trees that are iteratively constructed to optimize the performance on hard - to - classify training examples . In each iteration , any examples that were misclassified ( a positive example classified as negative , or vice versa ) have a higher chance of being selected in the next iteration so that the decision trees can learn to classify them correctly . We used a Gradient Boosting Tree Classifier implementation contained in the python package sci - kit learn v0 . 18 . 1 . The Gradient Boosting Tree function F of input x in stage m ( value of the output at the stage m ) is calculated using the formula below : 𝐹 𝑚 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝐹 𝑚−1 ( 𝑥 ) + 𝛼𝛾 𝑚 ℎ 𝑚 ( 𝑥 ) 𝛾 𝑚 = 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝛾 ∑ 𝐿 ( 𝑦 𝑖 , 𝐹 𝑚−1 ( 𝑥 𝑖 ) + 𝛼𝛾ℎ 𝑚 ( 𝑥 𝑖 ) ) 𝑛 𝑖 = 1 where  m is a value that is chosen to minimize the loss function and gets multiplied to a decision tree h m .  is a hyperparameter that represents the learning rate which controls how much each tree contributes to the output . Existing methods and baselines 14 We compared our classifier’s performance against 8 existing methods . We used 6 non - learning - based methods : Common neighbor ( CN ) 24 , Adamic Adar ( AA ) 25 , Jaccard coefficient ( JC ) 28 , BITOLA confidence ( BC ) 26 , Gene publications ( GP ) , and Linking Term Count with Average Minimum Weight ( LTC - AMW ) 29 . We also used 2 learning - based methods : Random Forest approach described in Kastrin et al . 24 and neural LBD by Crichton et al . 22 . The non - learning - based methods’ scores were calculated for the retrospective single KO set , and the learning - based methods were trained and tested using the same inputs as our LBD classifier . Model evaluation Performance is measured by how often a gene with a causative relationship to the measured trait is ranked at or near the top . We have a set of candidate genes per each phenotype MeSH term m in the retrospective single KO test set and per each experiment e , MeSH term m , and boundary b in the rediscovered test set . We reported the rank of the causative gene g within the group of candidate ( positive and negative ) genes ( Figure 2 ) . Explaining our predictions using supporting literature evidence To facilitate follow up researcher evaluations of our highest - ranking hypotheses , we sought to highlight each pair of phenotype - candidate gene with a curated list of papers that helps support our predictions . We first selected up to three most relevant intermediate nodes ( MeSH term or gene ) linking the phenotype MeSH term and the hypothesis gene using the BITOLA confidence score . Then , we reported the most recent paper that mentions the evidence terms and the hypothesis gene . If there are multiple papers published in the same year , we picked the paper with the highest paper score ( Supplementary Figure 5 ) . 15 Results The workflow of our results is shown in Figure 1 . Phenotype data Inbred mouse phenotype data 11 , 783 measurements were downloaded from MPD . We kept 4 , 939 measurements after removing any experiment that did not use at least 6 of our sequenced strains ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . 610 of them were not expected to be genotypically relevant ( e . g . , reporting mouse age at time of experiment ) . The remaining 4 , 329 measurements were used for candidate gene selection . Along with 49 additional experiments we created for presence / absence trait MGD reported across 14 of our strains ( see Methods ) . Phenotype separation boundaries 4 , 110 suitable MPD cases were reported in biological replicate values and the remaining 219 cases were only reported in average , standard deviation , and number of replicates used . 729 suitable MPD cases had at least one phenotypically separable boundary ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . 49 experiments we added were separated by the absence / presence of the MP term . In total , we found 1 , 133 phenotype separation boundaries in 778 experiments . Genotype data Whole genome variant calling We kept 23 , 230 , 042 SNPs and indels among 48 mouse inbred strains after discarding any variant that failed to meet the quality threshold ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) . Strain - specific variant filtering Using Phred - quality scores to filter strain - specific calls , 1 . 51 - 12 . 1 % of SNPs and indels had inconclusive calls per each of the 47 strains ( excluding the reference strain ) . Through generations of sibling mating , inbred mice are expected to have largely homogenized alleles . Indeed , we found that only 0 . 18 - 0 . 75 % of our variant calls were high quality heterozygous . 16 Comparing and supplementing our sequencing data with a published dataset We found that 742 , 480 , 455 or 99 . 9 % of our 743 , 170 , 690 conclusive allele calls in the overlapping 37 strains were supported by the MGP data ( 732 , 135 , 280 or 98 . 5 % identical and 10 , 345 , 175 or 1 . 4 % inconclusive by MGP ) . 5 , 812 , 957 ( 23 . 3 % ) of 24 , 925 , 741 calls we called inconclusive were called conclusively by MGP . After supplementing with MGP , our final calls in 47 strains include 817 , 092 , 836 ( 74 . 8 % ) homozygous reference , 232 , 498 , 308 ( 21 . 3 % ) homozygous alternate , 6 , 039 , 276 ( 0 . 6 % ) heterozygous , and 36 , 181 , 554 ( 3 . 3 % ) inconclusive calls . Gene set Our gene set contained 50 , 527 transcripts of 21 , 713 unique protein coding genes . In our downstream analysis , we only considered VEP’s variant consequences that affect the transcripts in our gene set . Genes with high - impact variants We identified 2 , 178 transcripts for 1 , 409 genes with at least 1 high - impact variant in at least one non - reference inbred mouse strain ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) . A high - impact variant can be either homozygous or heterozygous for one , or even two different high - impact alleles ( e . g . , 1 / 2 where 1 and 2 both represent high - impact alternate allele ) . Building candidate sets Each of 1 , 133 separable phenotypic boundaries , was compared to our 1 , 409 highly - impacted genes to build a candidate gene - phenotype set ( Supplementary Figure 3 and Methods ) . A total of 906 phenotype separations in 718 unique experiments had at least 1 candidate gene with an average of 17 . 53 , a median of 12 , a minimum of 1 , and a maximum of 103 candidate genes per phenotype separation . Previously reported causative gene - phenotype relationships We downloaded 296 , 254 gene markers to phenotype relationships ( 33 , 010 markers and 10 , 741 MP terms ) from MGD 4 . We mapped the gene markers to NCBI gene IDs in our gene set and kept only gene - phenotype relationships unambiguously mapped to 1 gene . The resulting set included 190 , 623 single gene - phenotype relationships among 10 , 054 MP terms and 12 , 551 protein - coding mouse genes . 17 Candidate genes previously linked to the measured phenotypes Exact Match We found 22 gene - phenotype relationships where the gene and the experiment were tagged with the same MP term suggesting our approach ( Figure 1 ) picked the correct gene to explain the experiment ( Table 1 ) . Interestingly , in only one of the cases , the high - impact variant we found had an MGD record of causing the measured phenotype . In all other cases , depending on the completeness of MGD , we may be the first to report the strain ( s ) specific potentially causative variant ( s ) . For example , DBA / 2J mice had elevated red blood cell counts compared to 10 other strains ( MPD : 22903 ) . 33 candidate genes fit this phenotype separation and only 1 gene , Cd33 , is known to cause the same phenotype , Abnormal erythrocyte cell number ( MP : 0001586 ) . DBA / 2J uniquely has a stop gain mutation ( GRCm38 / mm10 chr7 : 43528894 ) in Cd33 that may explain abnormally high red blood cells in this strain but missing in MGD . Full details of all cases are available at aimhigh . stanford . edu ( Supplementary Figure 6 ) . Descendant match There were 190 gene - phenotype relationships where the gene was mapped in MGD to a more specific ( descendant ) MP term of the experiment phenotype . These are shown in Table 2 . Only one high - impact variant is known in MGD , and other variant - phenotype relationships may be novel . Full details of all cases are available at aimhigh . stanford . edu ( Supplementary Figure 6 ) . As an example , MPD : 1903 measured non - HDL cholesterol levels in 14 mouse strains and found abnormally high non - HDL cholesterol level in NZB / BINJ mice . This experiment is tagged with Abnormal circulating non - HDL cholesterol level ( MP : 0020151 ) . Among 41 candidate genes that contained a unique high - impact variant in NZB / BINJ , Prlhr is the only gene annotated with a matching descendant phenotype term , Increased circulating LDL cholesterol level ( MP : 0000182 ) . There is a potentially causative stop gain mutation ( GRCm38 / mm10 chr19 : 60467194 ) in NZB / BINJ not found in any other strains , and this variant is not recorded in MGD . 18 Literature - based discovery ( LBD ) classifier MeSH - publication relationships We downloaded a vocabulary of 29 , 405 MeSH terms tagging 28 , 726 , 608 of 33 , 425 , 447 papers published between 1902 and 2022 for a total of 303 , 924 , 223 MeSH term m , publication pub ( in PMID ) , ( m , pub ) pairs . Gene - publication relationships We downloaded 177 , 518 genes from 3 , 478 species mentioned in 6 , 661 , 514 papers published up to 2022 , for a total of 14 , 632 , 626 gene g , publication pub , ( g , pub ) pairs . Publication graph The full 2022 graph used to featurize our candidate hypothesis prediction set ( Supplementary Figure 4A ) has 79 , 306 , 096 edges . Nodes have 48 median direct neighbors and the density of the graph , a ratio of number of edges present over the maximum number of possible edges in our graph , is 0 . 004 . Single - gene knockout positive set We downloaded 117 , 438 papers that contain the “Null / Knockout” attribute and are linked to exactly 1 gene . 61 , 403 papers describe a phenotype measured indicated by tagged disease MeSH terms about 8 , 268 unique mouse protein - coding genes . Building retrospective single KO train and test sets For the retrospective single KO train set , the labels of each gene g , MeSH term m , ( g , m ) pairs ( i . e . , positive for relationships defined by a single - gene knockout paper and negative for unknown relationships ) were derived from single - gene mouse knockout papers that were published between 2011 and 2015 , inclusive ( Supplementary Figure 4A ) . This set consisted of 1 , 619 positive edges and 2 , 516 , 571 negative edges for 568 MeSH phenotypes ( 2 . 9 positive and 4 , 421 . 7 negative mouse genes per MeSH term on average ) . For the retrospective single KO test set , we used single - gene mouse knockout papers that were published between 2016 and 2020 , inclusive . This set consisted of 1 , 130 positive edges and 2 , 586 , 932 negative edges for 469 MeSH phenotypes ( 2 . 4 positive and 5515 . 8 negative mouse genes per MeSH term on average ) . 19 Building rediscovered test set and candidate hypothesis prediction set We mapped 906 phenotype groupings to 170 unique MeSH terms . 47 phenotypes such as “KRTAP14 , spectral counts , hair proteomics ( MPD : 49233 ) ” were not mapped because they lacked a suitable MeSH term . In our rediscovered test set , we found 41 positive ( g , m ) pairs with at least 10 candidate genes whose direct relationship was established after 2015 , with a total of 898 negative pairs . Per experimental boundary , there were 24 . 1 candidates and only 1 . 1 of them came true after 2015 on average . Note that our phenotype - genotype matching ( Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 3 ) results in a significantly reduced candidate hypotheses compared to the literature - based , open discovery “ABC” method 22 , 23 used in the above sets . In our candidate hypothesis prediction set , we found 13 , 652 novel ( g , m ) pairs whose experiment had at least 10 candidate genes and no known relationship to the measured trait . Per experimental boundary , there were an average of 24 . 7 , a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 103 candidate genes . Classifier performance Open discovery is useful in automatically generating hypotheses 10 , 22 , but this approach resulted a very large candidate hypotheses set ( thousands of negative examples for each positive example ) . In Figure 2A , we show that on this exceptionally difficult task , our AIMHIGH classifier beats 8 existing methods . For example , in the retrospective single KO test set it ranks the positive edge in the top 10 among over 5 , 000 candidate genes in 34 out of 469 MeSH terms ( 7 . 4 % ) compared to 2 . 6 % by the next best method , BITOLA confidence 26 . We tested AIMHIGH on a secondary test set to assess how it would perform on a set with more realistic candidate sizes . Figure 2B shows this using our rediscovered test set . After 2015 , predicted from the 2015 graph it ranked the positive gene among top 3 in 79 . 5 % of the cases compared to the expected 4 . 8 % if we ranked all hypotheses randomly ( Figure 2B ) . Novel hypotheses Novel cases with few candidates 1 , 092 gene - phenotype relationships from our inbred strain analysis did not have a known explanation and had fewer than 10 candidate genes per phenotype boundary . In such cases , all 20 candidates can be reviewed closely in search of enticing hypotheses for testing . 17 such gene - phenotype relationships with at least 4 homozygous allele strains in the smaller phenotype group are shown in Table 3 . Full details for all 1 , 092 relationships are available on at aimhigh . stanford . edu ( Supplementary Figure 6 ) . For example , 7 strains showed low respiratory exchange ratio ( RER ) compared to 6 other measured strains ( MPD : 9214 , MPD : 9215 , MPD : 9216 ) . RER is the ratio between carbon dioxide produced through metabolic process and oxygen consumed . Lower RER indicates higher fitness level and higher muscle’s ability to get energy 30 . Only 1 candidate gene was found to match this phenotype split , Eif1ad16 , eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A domain containing 16 . Among the 7 strains in the lower group , 4 strains ( A / J , AKR / J , FVB / NJ , and SJL / J ) had a homozygous frameshift mutation , 2 strains ( BTBR T < + > Itpr3 < tf > / J and C3H / HeJ ) had inconclusive calls , and 1 strain ( 129S1 / SvImJ ) had a heterozygous mutation in this gene . All strains in the higher group had homozygous reference alleles except LP / J which had an inconclusive call . Eif1ad16 is currently not associated with any phenotypes in MGD . However , the eukaryotic translation initiation factor family are key regulators of translation initiation , and genes in this family have been suggested to initiate protein synthesis during recovery after resistance training 31 . We hypothesize that the strains high - impact variant in Eif1ad16 have faster muscle protein metabolism indicated by lower RER . LBD classifier’s top - ranked predictions Inspired by our rediscovered test set , we focus on the top 3 candidates predicted by AIMHIGH in all cases where 10 or more candidate genes exist . We found 750 most promising novel gene - phenotype hypotheses . A few examples are shown in Table 4 and discussed below . MPD : 5608 measured median current to trigger psychomotor seizure . C57BL / 6J showed the highest resistance compared to 8 other phenotyped strains . 6 of the 8 strains were sequenced and all shared the same frameshift variant in Brain expressed , associated with Nedd4 , 1 ( Bean1 ) gene . Our classifier ranked this gene above all other 22 other candidate genes . Bean1 is expressed in the central nervous system 32 , 33 , and the paralog of Nedd4 has been linked to susceptibility to seizure 34 . 21 A fear test after exposing mice to nicotine showed that A / J mice were less sensitive to nicotine effects compared to 7 other strains ( MPD : 47141 ) . 30 candidate genes fit this phenotype split . Our classifier ranked Gfra2 highest on the list . Promising evidence showed that cholinergic neurons are activated by nicotine 35 , and Gfra2 is required for the survival of cholinergic neurons 36 , 37 . MPD : 11012 measured diastema to pogonion distance . C57BL / 6J and C57BL / 10J had longer distances than all other the measured strains . These two also were the only strains phenotyped that had the homozygous reference allele in Smad6 . There were 68 candidate genes that fit this phenotype split , but the classifier ranked this gene highest . Encouragingly , MGD has recorded that Smad6 is expressed in the mandible , and this gene has been shown to be correlated with malocclusion 38 . Hundreds of similar leads can be found at aimhigh . stanford . edu ( Supplementary Figure 6 ) . Interactive web interface aimhigh . stanford . edu holds an easy - to - use web interface for users to view all of our findings in detail . There are four webpages corresponding to Tables 1 - 4 . See Supplementary Figure 6 . 22 Discussion We present AIMHIGH , an automated approach ( detailed in Figure 1 ) to suggest gene - phenotype testable hypotheses from community - contributed multi - strain phenotypic experiments and multiple strain genomes . By automatically finding one or more candidate gene whose high - impact variants split concordantly with the phenotypic measurement splits , we rediscovered hundreds of experimentally proven gene - phenotype relationships , validating our approach . Nearly all variants we highlighted in the context of these known gene functions are not found in MGD . More excitingly , we made thousands of potentially novel gene function hypotheses in experiments where we none of the matched candidates are already known to cause the measured phenotype . We developed a machine learning approach that leverages existing literature to highlight a handful of most promising gene candidates among 10 or more such candidates . Our approach relies on relatedness of the millions of peer - reviewed papers indexed by PubMed and annotated by MeSH and PubTator Central . We started by improving the state of the art in literature - based open discovery , working with an extremely challenging set of thousands of candidate genes for every gene function hypothesis where only few were validated 5 years from our prediction time . We purposefully chose a relatively long time - period so that seemingly new discoveries will not simply be from those papers archived , or conference abstract announced at the time we make our predictions . We then see again the power of our candidate building approach , which reduced the number of candidate genes per phenotype by two orders of magnitude compared to literature - based search . We show that even on the set without a known causative gene , one may only need to read on our top 3 highest ranked candidates per unexplained experiment to find the most plausible hypotheses . Our goal throughout the screen is to avoid false positive predictions . Conservatively , we only screened for high - impact variants that are more likely to impact the protein function . Variants that can be left shifted or right shifted to provide an alternative , less impactful , interpretation are discarded , and more . 23 In the future , one can consider ways to extend our approach to lower impact variants such as non - synonymous substitutions ( most of which have only a modest effect on gene function ) and to structural variants ( whose impact may often be high , but whose confident calling is challenging ) . Likewise , one can consider extending from the binary split we make into ones with more states , though the mapping of multi phenotypic groups to observed genomic changes becomes more challenging . To encourage our colleagues to discover novel biology using our exciting predictions , we built a web portal at aimhigh . stanford . edu , which houses all of our rediscovered and novel predictions . Our code is also open sourced , so that anyone can rerun it as is , with new sequenced strains , additional phenotypic experiments , presence / absence traits or newly published literature strengthening our inference and deriving novel testable hypotheses .

Figure 1 . Paper overview . Grey boxes ( e . g . , Table S1 , Fig 2 ) indicate illustrations and results accompanying each step . ( A ) For every experiment with multi - strain data in Mouse Phenome 30 Database ( MPD ) and strain - specific presence / absence phenotypes annotated by Mouse Genome Database ( MGD ) , we automatically sought trait values that would partition all measured strains into two groups . For each such phenotypic split , we sought one or more mouse gene with a matching genotypic split , using only the high - impact genomic variants that likely severely modify protein products . Each such match constitutes a trait explaining , possibly novel , hypothesis made by our approach . ( B ) Next , we used MGD known gene function annotations to find hundreds of gene function hypotheses we made that have already been successfully validated by single gene knockout experiments . In all but two such cases , even when the gene level function was already known , the high - impact variant ( s ) we discover in different strain genomes was not annotated in MGD . Encouragingly , we have thousands of additional gene function hypotheses for phenotypic experiments , suggesting rich grounds for novel gene function discovery . To aid with searching literature evidence for the most plausible candidate , we built a novel Literature - Based Discovery ( LBD ) framework . Finally , a web portal was developed to support easy browsing of all of our results . 31 Supplementary Figure 1 . Supplementary Figure 1 . Phenotype separation . We first sort strains by average intra - strain phenotype value . Then we consider each boundary ( n - 1 if n is the number of phenotyped strains ) to see if it is separable . To be separable , the right group’s minimum must be larger than the left group’s maximum ( i . e . , the gap is positive ) , and the sum of the standard deviations of the two strains flanking the boundary must be smaller than the gap size itself . ( A ) An example separable boundary between strain 1 - 3 and strain 4 . ( B ) An example of a non - separable boundary . 32 Supplementary Figure 2 . Supplementary Figure 2 . High - impact genomic variants . Using reference strain , C57BL / 6J ( MGI : 000664 ) , we called variants in 47 mouse strains ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . After filtering for quality , our calls were 98 . 5 % identical to Mouse Genome Project ( MGP ) calls for strains that were available in MGP . We used their higher quality calls to augment ours , and then used Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor ( VEP ) to retain only high - impact variants such as stop gain or loss . Variants with more than one alignment were kept only if both alignments resulted in high - impact variants . Finally , we filtered out variants in large families of predicted and smell associated genes ( see methods ) . The resulting set of high - quality candidate genes were matched against any phenotypic separation in Figure 1A . 33 Supplementary Figure 3 . Supplementary Figure 3 . Phenotype - genotype matchings . ( A ) Left : An example experiment is found ( automatically ) to separate strains 1 - 2 from strains 3 - 8 . Note that because the unit of measurement is arbitrary , calls of high / low , gain / loss are replaced simply by ( L ) eft and ( R ) right . Right : We tried to match four genes to the phenotype split . Gene 1 is a mismatch because of high - impact homozygous alternate calls in both groups ( strains 1 , 2 , and 7 ) . Gene 2 is a mismatch because of high - impact heterozygous alternate calls in both groups ( strains 1 and 3 ) . Gene 3 is a match ( note that sequencing or genotyping strain 8 or a conclusive call in strain 3 34 can revoke the match ) . Gene 4 is also a match . ( B ) How gene 3 from ( A ) would be shown in our web interface ( Figure S6 ) . 35 Table 1 . Known gene functions successfully rediscovered by our approach . In all shown cases , the candidate gene listed is already known to cause the experimental phenotype . However , only in the first ( Pde6b ) is the high - impact variant we found documented in MGD . See all details at aimhigh . stanford . edu ( Supplementary Figure 6 ) . 36 Table 2 . Additional known gene functions successfully rediscovered by our approach . In Table 1 , the gene annotated function was identical to the experimental term . Here , the gene annotated function is a descendant term of the experimental term . For example , the experiment was tagged with abnormal body weight while its candidate gene , Pax5 , is annotated with decreased body weight . Because of the large number of matches , we aggregated results by the experimental term . See all details of each match at aimhigh . stanford . edu ( Supplementary Figure 6 ) . 37 Table 3 . A sampler of novel hypotheses with few candidate genes . Many of our novel hypotheses have very few matching candidate genes per experiment . A handful is shown here . All matches with fewer than 10 candidate genes per experiment are available at aimhigh . stanford . edu ( Supplementary Figure 6 ) . 38 Supplementary Figure 4 . Supplementary Figure 4 . A machine learning framework to highlight our most promising novel testable hypotheses . ( A ) The classifier learns from examples in the retrospective single KO train set ( i ) to distinguish gene - phenotype relationships that became known in literature against gene - phenotype relationships that remained unknown ( see methods ) . Performance of the classifier is measured on the retrospective single KO test set ( ii ) and our rediscovered test set ( iii ) . Finally , the verified classifier is applied on our candidate hypothesis prediction set ( iv ) to prioritize the most promising candidates . ( B ) Each entity in the publication graph is either a MeSH term or Pubtator Central’s gene entity . For each paper , we obtained its MeSH tags , gene tags , and publication date . Undirected edges are extended between all MeSH terms and genes that are discussed in the same paper . ( C ) The retrospective sets are built using the open discovery framework on time - specific publication graphs ( see methods ) . In the example , at time T 0 , the MeSH term shown is ( only ) indirectly linked to two candidate genes . By T 0 + 5 years , only Gene1 was shown to be directly related ( potentially causative ) to the term . In the language of panel A , X = ( ( MeSH , Gene1 ) , ( MeSH , Gene2 ) and Y = ( ( + ) , ( - ) ) . 39 Table 4 . A sampler cases where our classifier ( Figure 1B ) singles out biologically exciting candidate genes . All novel hypotheses , including our classifier’s top - ranking genes and supporting literature are shown at aimhigh . stanford . edu ( Supplementary Figure 6 ) . 40 Figure 2 . Figure 2 . Predicting which gene function hypotheses would be proven over a 5 - year period . ( A ) Our machine learning classifier performance on an open discovery set built from mouse single gene knockout papers , where on average out of 5515 . 8 candidate genes , only 2 . 4 genes are verified over the next 5 years ( see Methods ) . While this task is difficult for all 8 approaches , AIMHIGH clearly improves the state of the art . ( B ) By matching phenotypic separation with genotypic separation ( Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 3 ) , we greatly reduce the search space for each trait . When we apply our classifier to known cases in our set ( Tables 1 and 2 ) with at least 10 candidate genes discovered over the same 5 year period , we see that the 41 causative gene ranks in top 3 in nearly 80 % of cases ( compared to 4 . 8 % if 3 candidate genes are picked at random ) , suggesting that reading ( or even directly testing ) a handful of our top - ranked novel candidate genes may be highly effective in discovering novel biology . See Methods for more on all 8 tested approaches . 42 Supplementary Figure 5 . Supplementary Figure 5 . Explaining our classifier’s predictions using supporting literature . We ranked all intermediate nodes linking the phenotype term and the highlighted hypothesis gene using BITOLA confidence ( see Methods ) . At the top would be intermediate terms most often co - mentioned with both phenotype and gene and therefore , possibly important in linking the two . For each evidence terms , our portal shows ( Supplementary Figure 6 ) the most recent paper that mentions both term and gene . 43 Supplementary Figure 6 . Supplementary Figure 6 . Roadmap of our web interface . We made all of our hypotheses available at aimhigh . stanford . edu . Each manuscript table ( 1 - 4 ) has a corresponding home page , formatted identically . The user can follow the purple instructions in each table to view details about each hypothesis , which include a phenotype plot with our derived boundary and a matching genotype plot . When applicable in Table 3 and Table 4 , intermediate nodes and representative papers that may help evaluate the novel gene function hypothesis are also presented . In Table 4 , our classifier result plot is also shown , with the selected gene hypothesis shown in red . Each page also has external links to the original data source ( e . g . , MPD and MGD ) to aid in further evaluation .
