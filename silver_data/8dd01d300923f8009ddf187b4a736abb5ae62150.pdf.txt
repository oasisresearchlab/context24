CBgs‐ParM shares many similarities in its basic filament architecture with actin , however , Pi release after nucleotide hydrolysis induces a large lateral strand shift of ~ 2 . 5 nm . We identified the ParR ( CBgs‐ParR ) that acts as a nucleation factor in the initial stage of polymerization , similar to ParR from Escherichia coli plasmid R1 . CBgs‐ParR also functions as a depolymerization factor , probably by recognizing the structural change in the CBgs‐ ParM filament after Pi release . Comparison with CBH‐ParM , another ParM from Clostridum botulinum , showed that subunit‐subunit interacting regions largely differ , preventing co‐ polymerization , implying a selection pressure in evolution to prevent interference between different ParMRC systems . Keywords : actin homologs / DNA segregation / filament turnover / nucleotide hydrolysis / ParMRC system Introduction While high‐copy number plasmids can be propagated in bacteria by passive diffusion for successful inheritance from mother to daughter cells , low‐copy number plasmids require an active transport system to ensure their proper inheritance . ParM , an actin homolog in prokaryotes , is a member of the ParMRC system ( Bharat et al , 2015 ; Salje et al , 2010 ) , which contributes to plasmid segregation in combination with ParR , another protein , and parC , a DNA sequence on the target plasmid . Each ParM unit binds one nucleotide , ATP or GTP , and forms a filament via polymerization , which pushes the plasmids apart . The bound ATP or GTP is hydrolyzed in the filament after polymerization . The hydrolysis of ATP or GTP and subsequent release of inorganic phosphate ( Pi ) largely destabilizes the filament and induces depolymerization ( Garner et al , 2004 ; Jiang et al , 2016 ; Koh et al , 2019 ) , a critical step for filament turnover . ParR is considered to have several properties : as an adapter that connects ParM to parC ; as a nucleator that initiates ParM polymerization ; and as a stabilizer of the filament ( Garner et al , 2007 ; Gayathri et al , 2012 ) . However , ParMRC systems are highly divergent ( Bharat et al . , 2015 ; Jiang et al . , 2016 ; Koh et al . , 2019 ; Popp et al , 2012 ) and a wide range of biochemical and structural features of the constituent molecules , in different bacteria , remain to be elucidated . Here , we report a novel ParM , CBgs‐ ParM , from Clostridium botulinum , which shows several unique features . Results : CBgs‐ParMRC CBgs‐ParM ( ED787363 . 1 ) and CBgs‐ParR ( EDT87283 . 1 ) sequences were identified through homology searches using BLAST on a whole genome shotgun sequence of Clostridium botulinum Bf 3 ( Accession ID : ABDP01000001 ) . “gs” represents “genome shotgun” . A putative parC sequence containing palindromic sequence repeats was also found immediately upstream of CBgs‐ParMR ( Fig . 1A ) . The putative parC sequence bound to ParR in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( Fig . 1B ) , indicating that the putative sequence acts as the CBgs‐ parC . Polymerization assay and ParR‐ParM interactions CBgs‐ParM polymerized with GTP , ATP , GDP and ADP at similar rates as judged by an increase in light scattering over time ( Fig . 1C ) . After polymerization , CBgs‐ParM remained as a filament without undergoing bulk depolymerization judged by constant light scattering intensity ( Fig . 1C ) , unlike previously studied ParMs ( Jiang et al . , 2016 ; Koh et al . , 2019 ) . Supernatant CBgs‐ParM concentrations in a sedimentation assay indicated that the critical concentration for polymerization were similar for the different nucleotides , determined to be 2 . 3 ± 0 . 1 µM , 2 . 8 ± 0 . 1 µM , 1 . 2 ± 0 . 1 µM , and 3 . 6 ± 0 . 4 µM with ATP , ADP , GTP , and GDP , respectively ( Fig . S1 ) . The critical concentration dependence of CBgs‐ParM on the nucleotide state was considerably smaller than that of actin ( Fujiwara et al , 2007 ) or E . coli ParM‐R1 ( Garner et al . , 2004 ) . Continuous phosphate release beyond the concentration of the protein ( 21 μM CBgs‐ParM ) was observed ( Fig . 1D ) , suggesting subunit exchange from the ends of the filament after the initial polymerization , consistent with a process such as treadmilling ( Narita , 2011 ; Pollard & Borisy , 2003 ; Wegner , 1976 ) . In the presence of CBgs‐ParR , the CBgs‐ParM initial polymerization rate was increased , indicating a filament nucleation property for CBgs‐ParR ( Fig . 1E ) . This is similar to observations for ParM‐R1 ( Garner et al . , 2007 ; Gayathri et al . , 2012 ) . However , after the initial polymerization , CBgs‐ParR destabilized the CBgs‐ParM filaments and depolymerization occurred , indicating that CBgs‐ParR also acted as a depolymerization factor ( Fig . 1E ) . A sedimentation assay also indicated the destabilization of the ParM filament by ParR after 30 min incubation ( Fig . S2 ) . CryoEM imaging Cryo‐electron microscopy ( CryoEM ) images of the CBgs‐ParM filaments were obtained under three conditions : ( i ) CBgs‐ParM polymerized with ATP for 30 min , ( ii ) CBgs‐ParM polymerized with GTP for 30 min , and ( iii ) CBgs‐ParM polymerized with GTP for 1 min . Filaments with similar diameters were observed under all three conditions ( Figs . 2A‐C ) . However , 2D classification of the images showed substantially different averaged images ( Figs . 2D‐F ) . The average images of CBgs‐ParM , polymerized with ATP , revealed obvious wide and narrow regions on the filament ( Fig . 2D ) , indicating a possible strand cross over . By contrast , the averaged images of CBgs‐ParM polymerized with GTP and a short incubation time , showed a more uniform diameter along the filament ( Fig . 2F ) . Finally , the averaged images for the longer polymerization of CBgs‐ParM with GTP appeared to show a mixture of the two states ( Fig . 2E ) . 4 Four density maps were reconstructed for the three polymerization conditions ( Fig . 3 and Table S1 ) . One map corresponds to the first condition ( ATP , 30 min ) , at 3 . 9 Å resolution . Two maps were reconstructed from the second condition ( GTP , 30 min ) , corresponding to the two groups in the 2D classification , class1 and class2 ( Fig . 2E ) . The map from class1 at 3 . 5 Å resolution was very similar to that from the first condition ( ATP , 30 min ) . The two models from the two maps ( ATP 30 min , and class1 with GTP 30 min ) , were identical up to the reliable resolution of the data , despite the difference in the bound nucleotides . In both maps , density due to gamma phosphate or inorganic phosphate around the nucleotide was not observed , indicating that the bound nucleotides were ADP and GDP , respectively . The maps from class2 with GTP ( 30 min ) and the third condition ( GTP , 1 min ) were similar to each other , although the resolution was limited , suggesting that they were in the state before the phosphate release . Crystal structure , rigid bodies and domain movement We successfully obtained a crystal structure of the apo form of a mutant of CBgs‐ParM , without bound nucleotide ( Fig . 4B and Table S2 ) , in which the nucleotide‐binding cleft was wide open . This mutant CBgs‐ParM was designed to prevent filament assembly via substitution of three residues in the protomer subunit : subunit interface , R204D , K230D and N234D . We compared the high‐ resolution model built into the cryoEM map of the GDP state filament ( Fig . 4A ) with the crystal structure of the monomer without nucleotide . We identified two regions that remained identical in the large structural change between the models , similar to those in actin ( Oda et al , 2019 ; Tanaka et al , 2018 ) . We named these regions , the inner domain ( ID ) rigid body and the outer domain ( OD ) rigid body ( Figs 4A and B ) , after actin rigid bodies . No hydrogen bonds were found between the region 144‐266 , almost the same as the ID rigid body , and the rest of the protein in either state , indicating that the ID rigid body can move independently from the rest of the protein . In the GDP state , instead of direct interactions between residues , GDP and a Mg 2 + connect the two rigid bodies via hydrogen bonds and salt bridges ( Fig 4C ) . This explains why the crystal structure without nucleotides was wide open . In addition , the guanine moiety of the GDP did not form any contacts or hydrogen bonds with the protein , explaining why CBgs‐ParM can utilize both GTP and ATP . The density of guanine and adenine moieties was relatively weak , indicating the flexibility of these parts due to their lack of interaction with the protein ( Figs . 3A and B ) . The OD rigid body interacts with GDP via the beta phosphate and Mg 2 + ( Fig . 4C ) . Thus , it can be considered that the cleft opening is dependent on the nucleotide state because this binding network would be significantly affected by the presence of another phosphate . Because of the limited resolution , we constructed models for the class2 with GTP and the short incubation time with GTP states with constraints keeping the two rigid bodies ( Fig . 3G and H ) . In comparison with the GDP state model , the nucleotide‐binding cleft was slightly open in these two states ( Fig . 4D ) . The models of both states were structurally similar , and they most likely correspond to the GTP or the GDP‐Pi state 5 before phosphate release . However , the resolution was not sufficient to confirm the nucleotide state . Filament structure The model with ATP was identical to that of class1 with GTP . Therefore , we compared the three remaining filament models : ( i ) class1 with GTP ( GDP state ) , ( ii ) class2 with GTP , and ( iii ) short incubation time with GTP . The intra‐strand interactions between subunits were very similar in the three models ( Fig . 5A and B ) , except for a slight shift in the position of the adjacent subunit in the GDP state . This difference can be explained by the closure of the cleft in the GDP state , which can push the upper subunit leftwards . Despite the similarity within single stands , a large change was observed between strands in forming the filament structure . When the ID rigid body of one subunit of each state was aligned with each other , the position of opposite strand was significantly different ( Fig . 5C‐D , Movie S1 ) , with a shift as large as 2 . 5 nm ( Figs 5D and E ) . More numerous inter‐strand contacts were found in the GDP state ( Fig . 5F ) compared to the class2 state with GTP ( Fig . 5G ) , suggesting stabilization of the filament bound to GDP . Comparison with CBH‐ParM We compared the CBgs‐ParM filament structures with CBH‐ParM filament structure , another ParM from Clostridium botulinum ( Koh et al . , 2019 ) . The core region was almost identical . However , the regions contributing to the subunit‐subunit interactions largely differed ( Figure 6 ) , which leads to differences in the rotational angles and the distances between the subunits in the two strands . Discussion CBgs‐ParMRC was identified from a whole‐genome shotgun sequence and we named it as CBgs‐ ParMRC to reflect the source . However , there is a possibility that this cassette originates from either a plasmid or from the genome , due to contamination from plasmids during genome isolation . We found gene clusters with high similarity to the sequence around CBgs‐ParMRC in the genomes of other Clostridium strains , but not in plasmids ( Figs . 7 and S3 ) . Therefore , at the current level of genome sequencing we conclude that CBgs‐ParMRC is probably encoded in the genome of a limited number of Clostridium strains . We speculate that CBgs‐ParMRC might contribute to genome segregation in bacteria , similar to microtubules in eukaryotes , although further investigation is required to elucidate its true function . 6 The cryoEM images showed obvious differences in the distribution of the nucleotide states between ATP and GTP at 30 mins after initiation of polymerization . It implies either that phosphate release from the ADP‐Pi state is faster than that from GDP‐Pi state , or faster nucleotide hydrolysis , shorting time in the states of ADP‐Pi and ATP in the nucleotide hydrolysis cycle . This is consistent with the faster phosphate release observed with ATP under steady state conditions following the initial polymerization ( Fig . 1D , gradient from 10 mins ) . Unlike other ParMs , CBgs‐ParM polymerizes with ADP or GDP ( Fig . 1C ) ( Garner et al . , 2004 ; Jiang et al . , 2016 ; Koh et al . , 2019 ) . The CBgs‐ParM filaments , polymerized with either di‐phosphate nucleotide , were stable ( Fig . S1 ) . Phosphate release from CBgs‐ParM polymerized from ATP or GTP did not cause filament instability , as observed for other ParM systems , rather the filament underwent a significant structural change . More inter‐strand contacts were observed in the GDP‐ bound state , providing stability after phosphate release ( Fig . 5F and G ) . When the strands in the GDP model were replaced by the class2 model with GTP , in silico , severe clashes were observed ( Fig . 5H ) . Therefore , the small change in the strand structure ( Fig . 5A ) caused by the opening of the nucleotide binding cleft ( Fig . 4D ) in the class2 model with bound GTP prevents the formation of the close contacts observed in the model with GDP . After phosphate release , the strands adopt the GDP conformation allowing for new inter‐strand contacts . Thus , phosphate release results in a large structural change in the filament . We discovered that CBgs‐ParM is depolymerize the filaments by a different mechanism to filament instability following phosphate release . CBgs‐ParR acts as a nucleating factor during the initial polymerization stage , but later acts as a depolymerization factor for the aged filament . We speculate that ParR recognizes the large structural change in ParM after phosphate release allowing it to change its role to depolymerization . This mechanism has parallels in the eukaryotic actin system , where cofilin senses the nucleotide status of the actin filament , resulting in depolymerization ( Carlier et al , 1997 ) . The biochemical and dynamic features of CBgs‐ParMR described above are unique among ParMRC systems . However , many ParMRC systems show different features , indicating a large diversity in this family of DNA segregation systems . For instance , another ParM from C . botulinum forms a 15‐ stranded filament with completely different inter‐strand interactions ( Koh et al . , 2019 ) . A ParM from Bacillus thuringiensis forms a double‐stranded non‐polar filament without ParR and a four‐ stranded filament with ParR , indicating that ParR acts as a template of the filament like gamma‐ tubulin for microtubules ( Jiang et al . , 2016 ) . The Clostridium tetani ParM forms a four‐stranded filament ( Popp et al . , 2012 ) , in contrast to the ParM from the E . coli R1 plasmid , which forms a double‐stranded polar filament similar to the actin filament ( Gayathri et al . , 2012 ; Popp et al , 2008 ) . In summary , the ParMRC systems form ParM filaments of wide diversity of architectures and dynamics . Usually , a specific ParMRC system is encoded on the plasmid to be segregated . However , the results from the current study indicate that the ParMRC system may also exist on 7 genomes and perhaps contribute to genome segregation . We have previously speculated that when two or more ParMRC systems exist in the same cell , faithful DNA segregation will rely on the two ParMRC systems being orthogonal to each other ( Gunning et al , 2015 ) . Therefore , a selection pressure to diversify the ParMRC systems may exist to prevent interference between different ParMRC systems , resulting in different architectures of their filament systems . This idea is consistent with our comparison of the ParMs from Clostridium botulinum ( Fig . 6 ) . The interacting regions between the subunits show larger diversity than the other regions , preventing them from co‐polymerization . Materials and Methods Protein Expression and Purification The CBgs‐ParMRC operon was originally identified through whole‐genome shotgun sequencing ( ABDP01000001 . 1 ) of a clinically isolated strain , C . botulinum Bf , which causes infant botulism . Constructs of parM and parR were synthesized and cloned into pSY5 and pSNAP vectors encoding an 8‐histidine tag followed by a human rhinovirus HRV 3C protease cleavage site , respectively . Plasmids were transformed into BL21 ( DE3 ) cells grown to OD 600 ~ 0 . 8 , and protein expression was induced with 0 . 2 – 1 . 0 mM IPTG overnight at 15 °C . The cultures were then centrifuged at 4000 × g and the cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mM Tris – HCl pH 8 . 0 , 500 mM NaCl , 20 mM imidazole , 5 % glycerol , 0 . 5 mg / mL lysozyme , 0 . 1 % Triton‐X , and protease inhibitor tablets ( 1 per 2 L culture , Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) and lysed via sonication . The cell lysate was then clarified by centrifugation at 30 , 000 × g for 30 min and filtered through a 0 . 45 µm membrane . The filtered supernatant was loaded onto a HisTrap FF 5 mL ( GE Healthcare , Marlborough , MA , USA ) pre‐ equilibrated with 50 mM Tris‐HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) containing 500 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole . Following a washing step , human rhinovirus HRV 3C protease ( 5 mg / ml ) was loaded in the same buffer for cleavage of tagged proteins ( 12 h at 4 °C ) . The cleaved protein was then eluted with washing buffer , pooled , concentrated and subjected to size‐exclusion chromatography ( Superdex 75 pg , GE Healthcare ) in 40 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM DTT . Fractions were checked for purity via SDS – PAGE , and the pure fractions were pooled and concentrated to between 5 and 10 mg / mL , as determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm using an estimated A 280 value calculated using PROTEINCALCULATOR v3 . 4 ( http : / / protcalc . sourceforge . net ) . Electrophoretic mobility shift assay The reaction mixture ( 10 µL ) containing 20 nM to 20 µM of ParR in 25 mM HEPES‐HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 300 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 1 mg / ml bovine serum albumin , 0 . 1 µg / µl sonicated salmon 8 sperm DNA , and 5 % glycerol was mixed at 25 º C for 10 min , followed by the addition of 20 nM 5’‐ FAM‐labelled parC DNA fragments and further incubation for 20 min . The polyacrylamide gels were prerun at 150 V for 1 h . After incubation , reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1 x TBE ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 4 % polyacrylamide gel in 1 x TBE running buffer ( 0 . 89 M Tris‐base , 0 . 89 M boric acid , 0 . 02 M EDTA , pH 8 . 3 ) at 150 V for 1 h . Gels were scanned using a Pharos FX Plus Molecular Imager ( Bio‐Rad , Hercules , CA , USA ) with an attached external laser . Polymerization assays : Assembly and disassembly of CBgs‐ParM at 24 °C was followed by light scattering at 90 ° using a Perkin Elmer LS 55 spectrometer for extended time measurements ( initial delay time due to mixing by hand ~ 10 s ) or a BioLogic stopped‐flow machine to observe the early polymerization phase ( initial delay time ~ 3 ms ) , monitored at 600 nm . Assembly was initiated by addition of 2 mM nucleotide at 24 °C in 20 mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 , 350 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 . Pi release assay 21 µM CBgsParM protein was mixed with the appropriate nucleotide in the same buffer as cryoEM conditions and incubated according to the time course . Reaction mixture was stopped by adding equal volume of ice‐chilled 0 . 4 M perchloric acid ( PCA ) . The reaction mixture was then centrifuged at 1 , 700 x g for 1 minute . Equal volumes of supernatant and Malachite Green reagent were mixed and incubated at 25 o C for 25 minutes ( Kodama et al , 1986 ) . Absorbance was read at 650 nm with a Hitachi U‐3010 spectrophotometer . Sedimentation Assay To investigate the critical concentrations for polymerization , polymerization of different concentrations of CBgs‐ParM ( 4 – 15 µM ) was initiated by the addition of 5 mM nucleotide ( ATP , ADP , GTP , and GDP ) in 40 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 300 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , and 0 . 5 mM DTT at 24 °C for 30 min . Samples were centrifuged at 279 , 000 × g for 20 min and pellets were resuspended in the same volume as the reaction . Concentrations of CBgs‐ParM in the supernatant were estimated via SDS – PAGE , and gel images were analyzed using ImageJ software . The concentrations were not dependent on the total concentration of CBgs‐ParM , indicating that they reflected the critical concentration for each nucleotide state . Therefore , the concentrations of the supernatants from different total ParM concentrations were averaged . 9 To investigate the effects of CBgs‐ParR on CBgs‐ParM , polymerization of CBgs‐ParM ( 20 µM ) with and without CBgs‐ParR ( 20 µM ) was initiated by the addition of 5 mM nucleotide ( ATP , ADP , GTP , and GDP ) in 40 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 300 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , and 0 . 5 mM DTT at 24 °C for 30 min . Samples were centrifuged at 279 , 000 × g for 20 min and pellets were resuspended in the same volume as the reaction and the concentrations of CBgs‐ParM in the supernatant were estimated via SDS – PAGE . Crystallography CBgs‐ParM mutant was constructed with three mutations ( R204D , K230D and N234D ) to prevent polymerization and allow for crystallization . Purified protein was subjected to crystallization trials by mixing and incubating 5 mg / ml CBgs‐ParM mutant and 1 mM AMPPNP on ice for 1 hour . Via the hanging drop vapour diffusion method crystals were grown in 0 . 5 µl of protein / AMPPNP and 1 µl of mother liquor ( 0 . 2 M ammonium chloride , 22 % ( w / v ) PEG 3350 ) at 288 K . X‐ray diffraction data were collected on a RAYONIX MX‐300 HS CCD detector on beamline TPS 05A ( NSRRC , Taiwan , ROC ) controlled by BLU‐ICE ( version 5 . 1 ) at λ = 1 . 0 Å . Indexing , scaling , and merging of data was performed using HKL2000 ( version 715 ) ( Otwinowski & Minor , 1997 ) . Molecular replacement using the protomer built into the 3 . 5 Å cryoEM density map was carried out in the Phaser ( Adams et al , 2011 ) after splitting the structure into the two domains . Model building was carried out in Coot ( Emsley & Cowtan , 2004 ) and refinement in PHENIX ( Adams et al . , 2011 ) . Data collection and final refinement statistics are summarized in Table S1 . Although CBgs‐ParM was crystallized in the presence of AMPPNP , the resultant structure did not contain nucleotide . Cryo‐electron microscopy CBgs‐ParM ( 0 . 7 mg / mL ) was polymerized in 20 mM HEPES‐HCl pH 7 . 5 containing 250 mM KCl , 1 . 7 mM MgCl 2 , and 3 mM GTP or ATP . The mixed solution was incubated for 30 min or 1 min at 25 °C . R1 . 2 / 1 . 3 Mo400 grids ( Quantifoil , Jena , Germany ) were glow discharged and used within an hour . The reaction mixture ( 2 . 5 µL ) was applied on the glow discharged grids , blotted on the EM GP ( Leica , Wetzlar , Germany ) and vitrified by plunging in liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen . Frozen grids were kept under liquid nitrogen for no more than 1 week before imaging . To screen for optimum conditions for cryoEM imaging , the grids were manually observed in a Tecnai G2 Polara ( FEI , Hillsboro , OR , USA ) cryo transmission electron microscope ( at Nagoya University ) equipped with a field emission gun operated at 300 kV and a minimal dose system . Images were captured at a nominal magnification of × 115 , 000 with an underfocus ranging from 1 . 5 to 3 . 5 μm and by subjecting the sample to a 2 s exposure time corresponding to an electron dose of ~ 30 electrons per Å 2 . Images were recorded on a GATAN US4000 CCD camera using an energy filter 10 operated between 10 and 15 eV , with each pixel representing 1 . 8 Å at the specimen level at exposure settings . Samples were imaged using a Titan Krios microscope operated at 300 kV installed with EPU software ( Thermo Fisher , Waltham , MA , USA ) at Osaka University . The imaging parameters were actual defocus 1 . 0 – 3 . 0 μm , dose rate 45 e − / Å 2 / s , exposure time 1 s , and three image acquisitions per hole . The images with ATP were recorded with a Falcon II detector ( Thermo Fisher ) at a pixel size of 0 . 87 Å / pixel with an objective aperture 100 µm , while the images with GTP and 30 min incubation time were recorded with a Falcon III ( Thermo Fisher ) at a pixel size of 0 . 87 Å / pixel with an objective aperture 100 µm . The images with GTP and 1 min incubation were recorded with a Falcon III ( Thermo Fisher ) at a pixel size of 0 . 87 Å / pixel with a phase plate . Image processing From the sample with ATP , 2 , 778 images were collected . Image processing was performed using RELION 3 . 1 ( He & Scheres , 2017 ; Scheres , 2012 ) software . After motion correction and contrast transfer function ( CTF ) estimation with CTFFIND‐4 . 1 ( Rohou & Grigorieff , 2015 ) , 1 , 868 images were selected for further image processing . Filaments were manually picked with e2helixboxer , after which particles were extracted at a box size of 384 × 384 pixels . After 2D classification , 36 , 762 particles were selected . The initial 3D reference was prepared using conventional helical reconstruction using EOS ( Yasunaga & Wakabayashi , 1996 ) . Helical symmetry converged to 167 . 6° twist / 22 . 3 Å rise along the left‐handed helix , and the resolution reached 3 . 9 Å . With GTP and 30 min incubation time , 1 , 398 images were collected . After motion correction and CTF estimation , 152 , 490 particles were extracted . We categorized Class2D averaged images into two by visual inspection . The first category contained 40 , 599 particles and the helical symmetry converged to 167 . 8 ° twist / 22 . 3 Å at 3 . 5 Å resolution , while the second contained 70 , 754 particles and helical symmetry converged to 165 . 7° twist / 21 . 7 Å rise at 6 . 5 Å resolution . For the map with GTP and 1 min incubation time , 2 , 772 images were collected and 153 , 326 particles were used for the final reconstruction at 8 . 6 Å resolution . Model building The initial atomic model with GDP was constructed by homology modeling using Rosetta3 with the pCBH ParM model ( Koh et al . , 2019 ) ( 6IZV ) as a template . The resulting model was iteratively refined using COOT ( Emsley et al , 2010 ) , molecular dynamics flexible fitting ( MDFF , using ISOLDE ( Croll , 2018 ) , an extension of ChimeraX ( Goddard et al , 2018 ) ) , and Phenix ( Adams et al , 2010 ) . GDP in the final GDP model was replaced by ADP to give the initial model with ADP , which was then refined using the same procedures . The final GDP model was also used as the initial model for the lower resolution structures ( PDBIDs 7X55 and 7X59 ) , which were fitted into the map by 11 MDFF with adaptive distance restraints for the two rigid bodies using ISOLDE ( Croll , 2018 ) . The resultant model was refined using COOT and Phenix . Rigid body search The model with GDP and the crystal structure without nucleotides were aligned with each other to maximize the number of Cα with less than 0 . 7 Å deviation between the two models . The resultant residues with less than 0 . 7 Å deviation were considered as the rigid body ( Tanaka et al . , 2018 ) . Two rigid bodies were identified ( Figure 4 ) .

A , B , C Cryo EM images of CBgs‐ParM filament formed with ATP , with GTP , or with GTP and short incubation time , respectively . D , E , F Averaged images after a 2D classification . The images with GTP were classified into two classes : class1 , similar to those with ATP ; and class2 , similar to those with GTP and short incubation time . 14 Figure 3 : Maps and models of CBgs‐ParM structure states with bound nucleotides . A , E with ATP B , F Class1 with GTP C , G Class2 with GTP D , H with GTP and short incubation time The structures with ATP ( A and E ) were almost identical to that of class1 with GTP ( B and F ) . The gamma phosphate could not be observed in A and B ( insets ) , showing that the binding nucleotides were ADP and GDP , respectively . The model for class2 with GTP ( C and G ) and the model with GTP and a short incubation time ( D and H ) were similar to each other . 15 Figure 4 : Identification of rigid bodies in CBgs‐ParM . A cryo EM model with GDP ( Fig . 3B ) B crystal structure without nucleotide Two rigid bodies were identified by comparing these structures ( ID rigid body , cyan and OD rigid body , magenta ) . C The bound GDP and Mg 2 + connected the two rigid bodies ( ID rigid body in cyan , OD rigid body in magenta and the rest of the protein in green ) . Possible hydrogen bonds corresponding to GDP were determined using UCSF chimera ( Pettersen et al , 2004 ) and presented as gray lines and possible salt bridges with the Mg 2 + presented by red dotted lines , although additional hydrogen bonds via water molecules may exist . D Models for the class2 with GTP ( orange ) and the short incubation time with GTP ( brown ) were aligned by the ID rigid body and superposed on the model with GDP ( green , cyan , and magenta ) . The nucleotide binding cleft was open in the models for the class2 with GTP and short incubation time with GTP . 16 Figure 5 : Structural shift in ParM filaments . A , B Two subunits in one strand ( A : front view and B : top view ) . The ID rigid bodies of the lower subunit were aligned with each other . GDP state : green and cyan , Class2 with GTP : orange and yellow , short incubation with GTP : brown and pink . The interactions between the subunits appear similar in the three states except for the upper subunit position , which was slightly shifted in the GDP state compared to the other two states . The closure of the cleft in the GDP state may explain this difference because the closure of the cleft can push the upper subunit leftward . A cyan arrow indicates the direction of the shift of the upper subunit . C‐E Relative positions of the two strands . C The model with GDP is presented as a surface model in green and white . Ribbon models for the class2 with GTP ( orange and yellow ) and the short incubation time with GTP ( brown and pink ) were superposed . The ID rigid bodies of the center subunits were aligned with each other . D A 180 ° rotated view of Fig . 5C . The opposite strand position in the GDP state was completely different from that in the other two states ( compare grey surface to cartoon ) . 17 E Top view of two adjacent subunits in the different strands . GDP state : green and cyan , Class2 with GTP : orange and yellow , Short incubation with GTP : brown and pink . The ID rigid bodies of the lower subunit ( green , orange and brown ) were aligned with each other . A cyan arrow indicates the direction of the shift in D and E . F Inter‐strand interactions in the CBgs‐ParM filament model with GDP . Atoms from the center molecule ( green ) in contact with the other strand ( cyan ) were presented in space filling models . 176 contacts were found . G Inter‐strand interactions in the model for the class2 with GTP . 36 contacts were found . H The strands of the model with GDP were replaced by the strands of the model for the class2 with GTP . The strands were aligned by the molecules indicated by black arrows . The clashing atoms were presented in space filling models . The contacts and clashes were identified by ChimeraX ( Goddard et al . , 2018 ) . 18 Figure 6 . Comparison with CBH‐ParM . A Comparison of subunit structures . CBgs‐ParM with GDP ( green , cyan and blue ) and CBH‐ParM ( gray and red ) subunits were structurally aligned by UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) . The residues that are more than 3 Å apart from the corresponding residue or that does not have corresponding residue were colored in blue ( CBgs‐ParM ) and red ( CBH‐ParM ) . B CBH‐ParM strand . Molecular distance and twist in the strand are 5 . 03 nm and 50 . 4 degrees , respectively . C CBgs‐ParM strand with GDP . Molecular distance and twist in the strand are 4 . 64 nm and ‐24 . 4 degrees , respectively . 19 Figure 7 . Gene clusters of Clostridium species containing ParMRC system . Genes within 5 , 000 bp of ParM are depicted using clinker & clutermap ( Gilchrist & Chooi , 2021 ) . Clostridium species containing homologous ParM sequences ( identity cutoff = 50 % ) are aligned . Genes are depicted as arrows . Conserved genes , ParM ( light green ) , ParR ( lime green ) , putative replication initiation factor ( magenta ) , sporulation‐specific N‐acetylmuramoyl‐L‐alanine amidase ( orange ) , dihydrodipicolinate reductase ( purple ) , and Cro / CI family transcriptional regulator‐like protein ( blue ) , are colored . Annotations are from GenBank records . parC is not displayed because parC sequence is not preserved among strains . 20 Figure 8 : Polymerization and depolymerization of bacterial actin homologs . Usual ParMs , form a stable filament with ATP or GTP . ATP or GTP is hydrolyzed in the filament , which makes the filament unstable , resulting in depolymerization . CBgs‐ParM has different features , with ATP / GTP hydrolysis accompanied by a significant change in the filament structure without large destabilization . ParR acts as a depolymerizing factor for CBgs‐ParM with ADP or GDP , in addition to a nucleation activity for CBgs‐ParM with ATP and GTP . 21 References Adams PD , Afonine PV , Bunkoczi G , Chen VB , Davis IW , Echols N , Headd JJ , Hung LW , Kapral GJ , Grosse‐Kunstleve RW et al ( 2010 ) PHENIX : a comprehensive Python‐based system for macromolecular structure solution .
