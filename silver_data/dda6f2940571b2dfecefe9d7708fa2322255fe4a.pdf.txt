INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY 49 : 1457 - 1468 , 2016 Abstract . Inhibition of angiogenesis has been focused on as a strategy for treating several diseases including cancer . In this study , a novel model peptide α AL14 was synthesized and used to identify its inhibitory effects on angiogenesis . The anti - angiogenic effects of α AL14 were investigated using vascular endothelial cells , HUVECs . α AL14 inhibited critical angiogenic processes including tubule formation , cell migra - tion and cell invasion with no influence on cell proliferation in HUVECs . Activity of VEGFR2 was inhibited by α AL14 treat - ment in HUVECs . Additionally , activities of major subsequent downstream factors of VEGFR2 such as ERK , FAK and Akt were decreased . α AL14 affected expression of Rac1 , Cdc42 , Arp2 and WAVE2 which are involved in formation of lamel - lipodia . Moreover , α AL14 reduced NF - κ B that can promote expression of several genes relating to cell invasion such as MMP2 and MMP9 . Therefore , the results suggest that α AL14 has a potential to be developed as anti - angiogenic drug for treating diseases driven by abnormal angiogenesis . Introduction Angiogenesis , making new blood vessels from existing ones , is considered as a key process in many physiological and pathological states . Many reports have demonstrated that angiogenesis is strongly implicated on cancer progression and metastasis ( 1 , 2 ) . Research on the molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis has rapidly advanced and it has contributed to the approval of anti - angiogenic drugs for cancer ( 3 ) . Recently , a large number of candidates composed of peptides have been developed because peptides have been considered as secure pharmaceutical reagents against angiogenesis - related diseases . However , there are many obstacles to synthesize optimized peptides for cancer treatment ( 4 , 5 ) . Raddum et al revealed that seven different model peptides based on Annexin A2 ( AnxA2 ) present anti - angiogenic effects on HUVECs . Especially , a synthetic peptide D1 - P2 adopting higher α - helical structure significantly inhibited network formation rather than the others in the co - culture system of HUVECs and SMCs ( 6 ) . Therefore , in this study , in order to reveal whether peptides containing α - helical structure can affect angiogenesis , a novel cationic linear α - helical model peptide , α AL14 , was used . Therapeutic strategies for treating diseases with abnormal angiogenesis use control of VEGF receptor 2 because it can modulate main angiogenic processes such as endothelial cell proliferation , migration and tube formation by activating cellular key kinases , ERK , FAK and AKT ( 7 , 8 ) . Rho GTPase family members are involved in cell migra - tion . Best - studied Rho GTPases , Rac1 , Cdc42 and RhoA , contribute to extend cell protrusions at the end of cell edge , motivating cells to migrate . Formation of lamellipodia is the primary step of cell migration . During cell migration , Rac1 activates Arp2 / 3 complex and WAVE2 to polymerize cytoskel - etal sheets at the front of cells ( 9 , 10 ) . Like cell migration , cell invasion is triggered through degradation of ECM , secreting special proteolytic enzymes , MMPs . MMP2 and MMP9 have vital roles in the degradation of ECM during angiogenesis ( 11 - 13 ) . In this study , a novel α - helical model peptide α AL14 was used to identify its anti - angiogenic properties . α AL14 inhib - ited angiogenesis by regulating VEGFR2 - mediated signaling and it affected expression of Rho GTPases ( Rac1 and Cdc42 ) The novel model peptide , α AL14 , regulates angiogenesis by inhibiting VEGFR 2 - mediated signaling in HUVECs NAN - HEE KIM 1 , CHANG - WON KANG 1 , HYE - JIN GO 2 , CHAN - HEE KIM 2 , NAM GYU PARK 2 and GUN - DO KIM 1 1 Department of Microbiology , College of Natural Sciences , and 2 Department of Biotechnology , College of Fisheries Sciences , Pukyong National University , Nam - gu , Busan 48513 , Republic of Korea Received May 10 , 2016 ; Accepted July 7 , 2016 DOI : 10 . 3892 / ijo . 2016 . 3651 Correspondence to : Professor Nam Gyu Park , Department of Biotechnology , College of Fisheries Sciences , Pukyong National University , 45 Yongso - ro , Nam - gu , Busan 48513 , Republic of Korea E - mail : ngpark @ pknu . ac . kr Professor Gun - do Kim , Department of Microbiology , College of Natural Sciences , Pukyong National University , 45 Yongso - ro , Nam - gu , Busan 48513 , Republic of Korea E - mail : gundokim @ pknu . ac . kr Abbreviations : HUVECs , human umbilical vein endothelial cells ; VEGFR2 , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ; VEGF , vascular endothelial growth factor ; MAPK , mitogen - activated protein kinase ; ERK , extracellular signal - regulated kinases ; PI3K , phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ; FAK , focal adhesion kinase ; MMPs , matrix metalloproteinases ; NF - κ B , nuclear factor - κ B ; ECM , extra - cellular matrix Key words : α AL14 , anti - angiogenesis , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 , cell migration , cell invasion KIM et al : α AL14 INHIBITS ANGIOGENESIS IN HUVECs 1458 and MMPs .

Results Amphiphilic α - helical structure of α AL14 . The sequence of the novel model peptide we synthesized is AAWKLLKALAKAAL . It is composed of abundant hydrophobic and basic amino acids without disulfide bonds . According to some research ( 19 , 20 ) , peptides including these features tend to be cationic linear amphiphilic peptides . Basic linear peptides take an amphi - philic α - helical structure and their amphiphilicity presents distinct biological activities ( 21 - 23 ) . In light of these facts , it is predicted that the synthesized peptide adopts an amphiphilic α - helical conformation because of its amino acid arrangement . According to helical wheel representation , all hydrophobic amino acid residues , A1 , A2 , L5 , L6 , A8 , L9 , A10 , A12 , A13 , and L14 were located on one side , whereas hydrophilic amino acid residues , K4 , K7 , and K11 , were located on the other side of the helix ( Fig . 1 ) . Therefore , we suggest that this peptide can be classified into the basic linear α - helical peptides and we named it as α AL14 based on the number of amino acids in this peptide and its α - helical property . Anti - proliferative effects of α AL14 on HUVECs . As angiogenesis is intimately associated with endothelial cell proliferation , and most angiogenesis inhibitors affect KIM et al : α AL14 INHIBITS ANGIOGENESIS IN HUVECs 1460 endothelial cell proliferation , we investigated whether α AL14 can inhibit growth of endothelial cells . HUVECs , HEK - 293 cells and HaCat cells were treated with α AL14 for 24 h . In HUVECs , α AL14 did not exert an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation at ≤25 µM but cell proliferation was decreased with a statistical significance when HUVECs was incubated with > 30 µM of α AL14 ( Fig . 2A ) . In contrast , HEK - 293 cells and HaCat cells were not affected by α AL14 treatment ( Fig . 2A ) . Moreover , in order to identify whether α AL14 can trigger apoptosis in HUVECs , a marker of early apoptosis , phosphatidylserine presentation , was detected staining with Annexin V . As shown in Fig . 2B , Annexin V - positive cells were observed when HUVECs were treated with > 25 µM of α AL14 for 24 h ( Fig . 2B ) . Therefore , our data suggest that although HUVECs are more sensitive to α AL14 than the other two cell lines , α AL14 tends to show anti - proliferative effect at high concentrations . Therefore , based on this result , we used concentrations ≤20 µM of α AL14 for further studies to identify biological activities of α AL14 excluding any inhibitory effects on cell proliferation or cell survival in HUVECs . A localization of α AL14 in HUVECs . As α AL14 presented hydrophobic property , we expected that this peptide penetrates Figure 1 . Predicted amphiphilic α - helical structure of α AL14 . In this perpen - dicular view of helix , the hydrophilic three Lys residues are located on one side and the hydrophobic Ala and Leu residues on the other side of the helix . Figure 2 . Effects of α AL14 on cell proliferation in HUVECs . ( A ) α AL14 inhibited cell viability in a dose - dependent manner . HUVECs were treated with various concentrations of α AL14 for 24 h and then BrdU was added for the examination of cell viability compared to control . Each column shows the mean ± SD ( n = 3 ) , * p < 0 . 001 . ( B ) α AL14 induced early stage of apoptosis in HUVECs . The cells were incubated with indicated concentration of α AL14 for 24 h and then stained with FITC - Annexin V solution to detect cells in early stage of apoptosis ( green , Annexin V - positive cells ; blue , nuleus ; scale bar , 20 µm ) . INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY 49 : 1457 - 1468 , 2016 1461 preferentially into the cytoplasm . To prove our hypothesis , we treated HUVECs with FITC - tagged α AL14 for the indicated time period . Even though HUVECs were treated with α AL14 for a relatively short time , α AL14 rapidly internalized cyto - plasm within 10 min and its FITC signal gradually increased ( Fig . 3A ) . α AL14 was distributed throughout the cytoplasm and translocated into the nucleus when cells were treated for comparative long time ( Fig . 3B ) . Accumulation of internalized α AL14 was increased in a dose - and temperature - dependent manner ( Fig . 3C and D ) . However , no interactions between α AL14 and cell membrane were detected in HUVECs . Inhibitory effects of α AL14 in tube formation of HUVECs . Effects of α AL14 on tubular morphogenesis of HUVECs were examined because several essential multiple steps including endothelial cell adhesion , invasion and migration are involved in tube formation ( 24 ) . Incomplete discontinuous tubule struc - tures were present in α AL14 - treated HUVECs . It indicates that the formation of tubule structures was disturbed by α AL14 treatment ( Fig . 4A ) . Consistent with this result , in quantitative analysis , total tube length decreased more than half degree in 20 µM α AL14 - treated cells compared to control ( Fig . 4B ) . Taken together , the results indicate that α AL14 is able to inhibit tubule formation on HUVECs at concentrations > 15 µM . Effects of α AL14 on endothelial cell adhesion , migration and invasion in HUVECs . In order to identify which steps of angiogenesis can be regulated by α AL14 treatment , effects of α AL14 on endothelial cell adhesion , migration and cell invasion were evaluated . First , inhibitory effects of Figure 3 . Entry of α AL14 into HUVECs . ( A and B ) Localization of α AL14 in HUVECs was observed by incubation time . HUVECs were incubated with 10 µM of FITC - tagged α AL14 at 37˚C for 10 min to 24 h . ( C ) Concentration - dependent entry of α AL14 was detected . HUVECs were treated with 15 µM of FITC - tagged α AL14 at 37˚C for 10 or 30 min . ( D ) Temperature - dependent entry of α AL14 was detected . HUVECs were treated with 10 µM of FITC - tagged α AL14 at 4 or 37˚C for 2 h ( green , peptide ; blue , nucleus ; scale bar , 20 µm ) . KIM et al : α AL14 INHIBITS ANGIOGENESIS IN HUVECs 1462 Figure 4 . Effects of α AL14 on tube formation in HUVECs . ( A ) α AL14 decreased tubule structures . HUVECs were incubated with indicated concentration of α AL14 for 18 h on Matrigel ( scale bar , 20 µm ) ( B ) α AL14 decreased total tube length . Total tube length in each group was quantified . Each value represents mean ± SD ( n = 3 ) , * p < 0 . 001 . Figure 5 . Effects of α AL14 on endothelial cell adhesion , migration and invasion . ( A ) α AL14 reduced adhesive ability in HUVECs . The cells were incubated with α AL14 for 2 h at 50 µg / ml in Matrigel - coated well . The cells were observed using an inverted microscope ( scale bar , 250 µm , left panel ) . Relative endothelial cell adhesion ability was quantified . Adhesive ability was decreased in a dose - dependent manner compared to PC ( NC , BSA - coated control ; PC , Matrigel - coated control without peptide treatment ) . The data indicate the mean ± SD ( n = 3 ) , * p < 0 . 001 ( right panel ) . ( B and C ) VEGF - induced endothelial cell migration and invasion were decreased by α AL14 treatment . HUVECs were incubated with various concentrations of α AL14 for 24 h . VEGF ( 20 ng / ml ) was used as chemoattractant . Images were taken by an inverted microscope ( scale bar , 250 µm , left panel ) . Values are mean ± SD ( n = 3 ) , * p < 0 . 001 ( right panel ) . INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY 49 : 1457 - 1468 , 2016 1463 α AL14 on endothelial cell adhesive ability were investigated . Adherent cells were decreased as much as negative control in 20 µM of α AL14 - treated HUVECs ( Fig . 5A ) . In Transwell migration assay , α AL14 significantly decreased VEGF - stimulated HUVEC migration ( Fig . 5B ) . α AL14 ( 15 µM ) reduced VEGF - stimulated cell migration about half degree compared to positive control in HUVECs . Following this , in Transwell invasion assay , α AL14 remarkably inhibited VEGF - stimulated HUVEC invasion compared to positive control ( Fig . 5C ) . Therefore , the results suggest that α AL14 can inhibit multiple biological processes including cell adhesion , migration and invasion in endothelial cells during angiogenesis . Effects of α AL14 on VEGFR2 - mediated signaling in HUVECs . VEGF receptor 2 is a major receptor for regulating angiogenesis , which activates various downstream signaling pathways ( 7 ) . In order to identify α AL14 - induced anti - angiogenic effects on VEGFR2 - mediated signaling pathways , protein expression level of VEGFR2 was investigated . As a Figure 6 . Effects of α AL14 on VEGFR2 activity and VEGFR2 - mediated downstream HUVECs . HUVECs were treated with α AL14 for 30 min . Expression level of VEGFR2 , phospho - VEGFR2 and many different components involved in VEGFR2 - mediated signaling was detected using western blot analysis . Expression level of each protein was quantified . Each column represents the mean ± SD ( n = 3 ) , * p < 0 . 001 . α AL14 decreased phosphorylated form of VEGFR2 , but not total form of VEGFR2 ( A ) . α AL14 inhibited the activation of VEGFR2 - mediated downstream signaling . The activation of MEK and EKR ( B ) , c - Src and FAK ( C ) , AKT and mTOR ( D ) was decreased by α AL14 treatment . KIM et al : α AL14 INHIBITS ANGIOGENESIS IN HUVECs 1464 result , α AL14 significantly reduced phosphorylated VEGFR2 at Tyr 1175 , but did not affect total VEGFR2 protein expression ( Fig . 6A ) . In addition , fluorescent signal of phosphorylated VEGFR2 was diminished in response to α AL14 treatment ( Fig . 7A ) . Upon these results , we hypothesized that α AL14 is able to downregulate VEGFR2 downstream factors and we investigated expression level of VEGFR2 downstream factors including MEK1 / 2 , ERK1 / 2 , Src and Akt . Consistent with our hypothesis , active form of phosphorylated MEK1 / 2 and ERK1 / 2 was significantly decreased while total ERK 1 / 2 was not altered by α AL14 treatment ( Fig . 6B ) . In addition , α AL14 inhibited activation of Src and FAK ( Fig . 6C ) , Akt and mTOR ( Fig . 6D ) in a dose - dependent manner , and most of the factors we examined were affected with statistical significance at concentration of > 15 µM . Altered localization of phosphorylated ERK1 / 2 , FAK and Akt verified regulatory effects of α AL14 on these three factors ( Fig . 7B - D ) . Taken together , our results indicate that α AL14 provokes its anti - angiogenic activity through downregulating the activation of VEGFR2 - mediated downstream signaling pathway in HUVECs . Effects of α AL14 on factors for actin polymerization in HUVECs . As actin polymerization is an essential step in Figure 7 . Effects of α AL14 on distribution of phosphorylated VEGFR2 , ERK1 / 2 and FAK . HUVECs were treated with 15 µM α AL14 for 30 min . After incuba - tion , cells were assessed with phosphorylated VEGFR2 , ERK1 / 2 of FAK . Images were taken by confocal microscope . ( A ) Distribution of phospho - VEGFR2 was changed by α AL14 ( scale bar , 10 µm ) . ( B ) Translocation of ERK1 / 2 was decreased by α AL14 ( scale bar , 20 µm ) . ( C ) FAK activity on cell membrane was decreased by α AL14 ( scale bar , 10 µm ) . ( D ) Phosphorylated Akt was decreased in response to α AL14 treatment ( scale bar , 20 µm ) . INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY 49 : 1457 - 1468 , 2016 1465 endothelial cell migration , we investigated whether α AL14 has regulatory effect on actin polymerization - related factors Rho GTPase . Although α AL14 inhibited Rac1 and Cdc42 , Rac1 was much effectively downregulated than Cdc42 . In contrast , RhoA was not affected in α AL14 - treated condi - tion ( Fig . 8 ) Thus , we hypothesized that α AL14 is capable of regulating lamellipodia because Rac1 is involved in the formation of lamellipodia at the edge of cells ( 9 ) . α AL14 relocated Rac1 away from cell membrane where lamellipodia formed ( Fig . 8B ) , and suppressed expression level of Arp2 / 3 and WAVE2 ( Fig . 8C ) which are activated by Rac1 to extend lamellipodium at cell membrane ( 25 ) . Taken together , our results demonstrate that α AL14 may induce the disorganiza - tion of lamillipodium extension via impairing Rac1 signaling in HUVECs . Effects of α AL14 on MMPs expression in HUVECs . Because endothelial cells secret MMPs to gain cellular motility by degrading surrounding ECM , expression level of MMP9 , MMP2 and NF - κ B , one of the well - known transcription factors for the transcription of MMP9 and MMP2 , were examined . Expression of MMP9 and MMP2 were suppressed by α AL14 treatment ( Fig . 9A ) . Phosphorylated NF - κ B were reduced in comparison with control while total form of NF - κ B was not changed ( Fig . 9A ) . As well as the decrease in protein level of MMP9 and MMP2 , decrease in mRNA level was observed in response to α AL14 treatment ( Fig . 9B ) . Therefore , we suggest that α AL14 can reduce the expression of MMP9 and MMP2 via suppressing the activation of NF - κ B . Discussion Amphipathic α - helical model peptides have been considered as anti - bacterial agents due to their cationic net charge and amphipathic structure ( 26 ) . In a recent study , Raddum et al demonstrated that seven different designed peptides based on AnxA2 exhibited anti - angiogenic effects on capillary - like network formation in co - culture system of HUVECs and smooth muscle cells . As D1 - P2 peptide including α - helical conformational structures tended to exert more significant Figure 8 . Effects of α AL14 on components related to cytoskeleton organization . ( A and C ) α AL14 suppressed expression of components related with lamellipodia formation . HUVECs were treated with α AL14 for 24 h . Protein expression levels of Rac1 , cdc42 , RhoA , Arp2 / 3 and WAVE2 were detected by western blot analysis . Each column represents the mean ± SD ( n = 3 ) , * p < 0 . 001 . ( B ) α AL14 changed the distribution of Rac1 in HUVECs . HUVECs were treated with α AL14 for 24 h . In immunofluorescence staining , the cells were evaluated with Rac1 . Images were taken by confocal microscope ( scale bar , 10 µm ) . KIM et al : α AL14 INHIBITS ANGIOGENESIS IN HUVECs 1466 inhibitory effect on formation of capillary - like networks rather than others ( 6 ) we expected that α AL14 which is assumed to contain α - helical structure has similar effects on endothelial cells . Moreover , there have been efforts to develop endogenous peptides that can penetrate into target cells across the cell membrane because the peptides have lower toxicity without drawbacks ( 3 , 5 ) . Therefore , we focused on identifying effects of the novel model peptide α AL14 on angiogenic processes and its permeability in HUVECs . With negative effects of α AL14 on tube formation in HUVECs , α AL14 was able to decrease endothelial cell adhesive , migratory and invasive ability at the same range of concentrations that affected tube formation but anti - proliferative effects on HUVECs induced by apoptosis did not exist . It means that α AL14 is more effective in control - ling endothelial cell adhesion , migration and invasion rather than its proliferation during angiogenesis . VEGFR2 has an important role in pathological angiogen - esis of which functions are allowed to become a molecular target for treating various diseases . Phosphorylation of VEGFR2 is a central event for activation of VEGF - mediated angiogenic pathways including endothelial cell prolifera - tion and migration ( 7 , 27 ) . In our study , as phosphorylation level of VEGFR2 was decreased by α AL14 treatment , we expected that attenuated VEGFR2 can decrease its down - stream factors . As we expected , α AL14 inhibited the subsequent downstream factors such as ERK , FAK , and Akt . Because phosphorylated VEGFR2 at Tyr 1175 is directly connected with an activation of MAPK / ERK and PI3K / Akt / mTOR signaling to promote endothelial cell proliferation and migration via several downstream signaling ( 28 - 31 ) , our data suggest that , in α AL14 - treated HUVECs , angiogenesis can be regulated through the decrease in phosphorylation of VEGFR2 . FAK is an important component in FAK signaling relating to VEGF - induced endothelial cell migration , which can activate itself through phosphorylation at Tyr 397 ( 32 - 35 ) . In addition , Jean et al have demonstrated that c - Src activity is required for full activation of FAK by phosphorylating Tyr 576 / 577 in response to VEGF treatment ( 36 ) . However , our data show that phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr 397 and 576 / 577 was diminished by α AL14 treatment except total form of FAK . It demonstrates that α AL14 can inhibit endothelial cell migration , by regulating activation of FAK in HUVECs . In addition , based on the result that the phosphorylation of FAK at 397 was much reduced compared to 576 / 577 , it is suggested that auto - phosphorylation of FAK is affected sensitively to exposure of α AL14 within 30 min . In order to identify other molecular targets of α AL14 in connection with endothelial cell migration , expression of Rac1 , Cdc42 and RhoA ( members of Rho GTPAses ) was evaluated because they have critical roles in actin dynamics to extend cellular protrusion ( 37 - 39 ) . While RhoA expression was not altered by α AL14 treatment , the expression of Rac1 and Cdc42 was changed , and Rac1 was more affected than Cdc42 . Because both Arp2 and WAVE2 cooperate with Rac1 for formation of lamellipodia ( 40 - 42 ) cellular level of Arp2 and WAVE2 was examined . From our data , we suggest that α AL14 may disorganize formation of lamellipodia , which is caused by the weak signal of Rac1 in HUVECs . In terms of endothelial cell invasion , enzymatic families of MMPs are involved in endothelial cell invasion ( 12 ) and their transcription is regulated by certain transcription factors such as NF - κ B ( 13 , 43 , 44 ) . Therefore , our data suggest that the expression level of MMP2 and MMP9 was inhibited by Figure 9 . Effects of α AL14 on expression of MMP2 and MMP9 . ( A ) α AL14 downregulated the expression of MMP2 and MMP9 through inhibiting NF - κ B activity . HUVECs were treated with α AL14 for 24 h and protein expression levels of MMP2 , MMP9 , NF - κ B and phospho - NF - κ B were detected by western blot analysis . All statistical data represent mean ± SD ( n = 3 ) , * p < 0 . 001 . ( B ) mRNA levels of MMP2 and MMP9 were decreased by α AL14 treatment . HUVECs were treated with α AL14 for 24 h . mRNA levels of MMP2 and MMP9 were examined by RT - PCR . Data represent mean ± SD ( n = 3 ) , * p < 0 . 001 . INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY 49 : 1457 - 1468 , 2016 1467 α AL14 through attenuating the activation of their transcription factor NF - κ B . Although rapid entry of α AL14 was observed , its inter - nalization mechanism is not clear . However , we can suppose how α AL14 is transferred through the cell membrane . The improvement on internalization of α AL14 at higher tempera - ture indicates that its entry into cells might be mediated by endocytosis , interacting cell membrane receptors . Because several studies have described that the peptides which can easily penetrate into cells at higher temperature rather than lower temperature are entered through receptor - mediated endocytosis . Furthermore , α - helical structure in peptides has an important role in recognition between peptides and cell receptors ( 45 - 47 ) . Therefore , we suggest that the internaliza - tion of α AL14 containing α - helical structure is connected with receptor - mediated endocytic process of VEGFR2 , at least in part , in HUVECs . In conclusion , we confirmed that the novel model peptide α AL14 penetrated into endothelial cells and regulated various VEGFR2 - mediated signaling such as MAPK / ERK , Akt and FAK within relatively short time . α AL14 controlled not only Rac1 and but also Arp2 / 3 and WAVE2 , leading to decrease in cell migration . In addition , decreased expression of MMP2 and MMP9 resulted in inhibition of cell invasion in HUVECs with α AL14 treatment for a relative long time . Therefore , α AL14 may possess two features in the regulation of angio - genesis . One is that α AL14 can inactivate VEGFR2 - mediated signaling with preferential internalization into the cytoplasm in a short period of time . The other is maintaining its anti - angiogenic effects by suppressing several factors involved in endothelial cell migration and invasion with broad distribution in cytoplasm and nucleus in HUVECs . Based on these data , we propose that α AL14 has the potential for being developed as a new angiogenesis inhibitor .
