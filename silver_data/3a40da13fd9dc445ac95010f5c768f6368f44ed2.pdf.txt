Ontology groups representing angiogenesis and blood vessels development are highly up - regulated during porcine oviductal epithelial cells long - term real - time proliferation – a primary cell culture approach Abstract The morphological and biochemical modification of oviductal epithelial cells ( OECs ) belongs to the group of compound processes responsible for proper oocyte transport and successful fertilization . The cellular in - teractions between cumulus - oocyte complexes ( COCs ) and oviductal epithelial cells ( OECs ) are crucial for this unique mechanism . In the present study we have analyzed angiogenesis and blood vessel development processes at transcript levels . By employing microarrays , four ontological groups associated with these me - chanisms have been described . Differentially expressed genes belonging to the “angiogenesis” , “blood circu - lation” , “blood vessel development” and “blood vessel morphogenesis” GO BP terms were investigated as a potential markers for the creation of new blood vessels in cells under in vitro primary culture conditions .

Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 187 Introduction The histological architecture of oviducts under - goes substantial modification in response to the fe - male reproductive cycle . These morphological mod - ifications are substantially accompanied by changes within ovary and ovarian follicles during ovulation . The morphological changes are accompanied by changes in cellular metabolism , which is associat - ed with secretion of hormones , and / or synthesis of growth factors , that facilitate the transport of fully mature MII oocytes through the oviduct before fer - tilization . The cellular interactions between cumu - lus - oocyte complexes ( COCs ) and oviductal epithe - lial cells ( OECs ) are crucial for this unique „journey” . Moreover , the tissue and cell plasticity appear to be important factors determining proper gamete local - ization , and are crucial for successful monospermic fertilization . Therefore , it has been suggested that the normal fertilization is a compound process reg - ulated by proper oviductal receptivity and sensitiv - ity as well as subsequent recognition , interaction and fusion of the gametes . Our recent experiments indicated that the gene expression profile changes within the OECs were also accompanied by significant changes in their in vitro proliferation capability . The long - term in vitro cultivation ( IVC ) demonstrated an increase of Cell Proliferation Index after 48 - 72 hours , which was associated with changes in transcriptomic profile . The progress of OECs’ in vitro proliferation may be orchestrated by their biochemical and metabolom - ic profile , which is directly associated with cellular senescence . However , the increased in vitro prolifer - ation ability of the OECs was also accompanied by a differentiation capability , which may be recognized as the „fingerprint” of their developmental compe - tence and stemness specificity during long - term in vitro primary culture . The angiogenesis and blood vessel development are compound processes , directly associated with organogenesis and tissue regeneration . One of the biggest clinical concepts of the 21 st century are arti - ficial organs formation , 3D bio - printing and regen - erative and reconstructive medicine . The formation of new vessels that supply a tissue during regenera - tion is crucial for tissue reconstruction . It is suggested that the blood vessels develop - ment and neoangiogenesis are important factors determining tissue specific reorganization and cellular morphological modification within the re - productive tract , especially in the oviduct and en - dometrium . However , the molecular basics of these processes in porcine oviducts was never investigat - ed before . Moreover , this study aimed to investigate the transcriptomic profile of genes regulating an - giogenesis and blood vessel development in OECs , in conditions of long term in vitro culture . Material and Methods Animals In this study , crossbred gilts ( n = 45 ) at the age of about nine months , which displayed two regular es - trous cycles were collected from a commercial herd . All the animals were checked daily for estrus behav - ior and were slaughtered after reaching the anestrus phase of the estrus cycle . The uteri were then trans - ported to the laboratory within 30 min at 38 °C . Oviductal epithelial cells ( OECs ) selection and culture Oviducts were washed twice in Dulbecco’s phos - phate buffered saline ( PBS ) ( 137 mM NaCl , 27 mM KCl , 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7 . 4 ) . Epithe - lial cells were surgically removed using sterile surgi - cal blades . Then , the epithelium was incubated with collagenase I ( Sigma Aldrich , Madison , USA ) , 1mg / mL in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ; Sigma Aldrich , Madison , USA ) for 1h at 37°C . The cell suspension obtained from this digestion was filtered through 40 µm pore size strainer to remove blood and single cells . The residue was collected by rinsing the strainer with DMEM . The cells were centrifuged ( 200 g , 10 min . ) , washed in PBS and centrifuged again . Then , the cells were incubated with 0 . 5 % Trypsin / EDTA ( Sigma Aldrich , Madison , USA ) at 37°C for 10 min . The reaction was stopped with fetal calf serum ( FCS ; Sigma Aldrich , Madison , USA ) . After incubation , cells where filtered and cen - trifuged again . The final cell pellet was suspended in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS , 100U / mL penicillin , 100 µg / mL streptomycin and 1µg / mL amphotericin B . The cells were cultured at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 . Once the OEC cultures attained 70 – 80 % confluency , they were washed with PBS and passaged . The passage proce - dure involves cell digestion with 0 . 025 % Trypsin / EDTA , enzyme neutralization by a 0 . 0125 % trypsin inhibitor ( Cascade Biologics , Portland , USA ) , cen - trifugation of samples , and resuspension at a seed - ing density of 2x10 4 cells / cm 2 . The culture medium was changed every three days . RNA extraction from Oviductal epithelial cells ( OECs ) Oviductal epithelial cell were pooled and harvest - ed at 24h , 7 days , 15 days and 30 days after the begin - ning of in vitro the culture . Total RNA was extracted from samples using TRI Reagent ( Sigma , St Louis , MO , USA ) and RNeasy MinElute cleanup Kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) . The amount of total mRNA was determined from the optical density at 260 nm , and the RNA purity was estimated using the 260 / 280 nm absorption ratio ( higher than 1 . 8 ) ( NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer , Thermo Scientific ) . The RNA integrity and quality were checked on a Bio - Nawrocki et al . Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 188 analyzer 2100 ( Agilent Technologies , Inc . , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . The resulting RNA integrity num - bers ( RINs ) were between 8 . 5 and 10 with an av - erage of 9 . 2 ( Agilent Technologies , Inc . , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . The RNA in each sample was diluted to a concentration of 100 ng / μl with an OD260 / OD280 ratio of 1 . 8 / 2 . 0 . From each RNA sample , 100 ng of RNA was taken for microarray expression assays . Microarray expression analysis and statistics Total RNA ( 100 ng ) from each pooled sample was subjected to two rounds of sense cDNA amplifica - tion ( Ambion® WT Expression Kit ) . The obtained cDNA was used for biotin labeling and fragmenta - tion by Affymetrix GeneChip® WT Terminal Label - ing and Hybridization ( Affymetrix ) . Biotin - labeled fragments of cDNA ( 5 . 5 μg ) were hybridized to the Affymetrix® Porcine Gene 1 . 1 ST Array Strip ( 48°C / 20 h ) . Microarrays were then washed and stained according to the technical protocol using the Affymetrix GeneAtlas Fluidics Station . The array strips were scanned employing Imaging Station of the GeneAtlas System . Preliminary analysis of the scanned chips was performed using Affymetrix Ge - neAtlas TM Operating Software . The quality of gene expression data was confirmed according to the quality control criteria provided by the software . The obtained CEL files were imported into down - stream data analysis software . All of the presented analyses and graphs were performed using Bioconductor and R programming languages . Each CEL file was merged with a descrip - tion file . In order to correct background , normalize , and summarize results , the Robust Multiarray Aver - aging ( RMA ) algorithm was used . To determine the statistical significance of the analyzed genes , mod - erated t - statistics from the empirical Bayes method were performed . The obtained p - value was correct - ed for multiple comparisons using Benjamini and Hochberg’s false discovery rate . The selection of significantly altered genes was based on a p - value beneath 0 . 05 and expression higher than two fold . Differentially expressed genes were subjected to selection by examination of genes involved in the GO processes of interest . The differentially ex - pressed gene list ( separated for up - and down - reg - ulated genes ) was uploaded to DAVID software ( Database for Annotation , Visualization and Inte - grated Discovery ) [ 1 ] , where genes belonging to “angiogenesis” , “blood circulation” , “blood vessel de - velopment” and “blood vessel morphogenesis” GO BP terms were extracted . Expression data of these genes were also subjected to a hierarchical clusteri - zation procedure , and their expression values were presented as a heat map . Subsequently we analyzed the relation between the genes belonging to chosen GO terms with GO - plot package [ 2 ] . The GoPlot package had calculated the z - score : the number of up - regulated genes mi - nus the number of down - regulated genes divided by the square root of the count . This information allowed for estimating the change course of each gene - ontology term . Interactions between differentially expressed genes / proteins belonging to the studied gene on - tology group were investigated by the STRING10 software ( Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interact - ing Genes ) [ 3 ] . The list of gene names was used as a query for an interaction prediction . The search criteria were based on co - occurrences of genes / proteins in scientific texts ( text mining ) , co - expres - sion , and experimentally observed interactions . The results of such analyses generated a gene / protein interaction network , where the intensity of the edg - es reflected the strength of the interaction score . Finally the functional interactions between genes that belongs to the chosen GO BP terms were inves - tigated by REACTOME FIViz application to the Cy - toscape 3 . 6 . 0 software . The Reactome FIViz app is designed to find pathways and network patterns related to cancer and other types of diseases . This app accesses the pathways stored in the Reactome database , allowing to do pathway enrichment anal - ysis for a set of genes , visualize hit pathways using manually laid - out pathway diagrams directly in Cytoscape , and investigate functional relationships among genes in hit pathways . The app can also access the Reactome Functional Interaction ( FI ) network , a highly reliable , manually curated path - way - based protein functional interaction network covering over 60 % of human proteins .

Bioethical Committee approval no . 83 / 2012 / DNT . Results Whole transcriptome profiling by Affymetrix mi - croarray allow us to analyze the gene expression changes between 7 , 15 and 30 days of porcine ovi - ductal epithelial cell culture . Using Affymetrix® Porcine Gene 1 . 1 ST Array Strip we examined the expression of 12257 transcripts . Genes with fold change higher then abs ( 2 ) and with corrected p - va - lue lower than 0 . 05 were considered as differentially expressed . This set of genes consists of 2533 diffe - rent transcripts . DAVID ( Database for Annotation , Visualization and Integrated Discovery ) software was used for extraction of gene ontology biological process terms ( GO BP ) that contain differently expressed tran - scripts . Up and down regulated gene sets were sub - jected to DAVID search separately , and only gene sets where adj . p value were lower than 0 . 05 were selec - ted . The DAVID software analysis showed that diffe - Nawrocki et al . Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 189 rently expressed genes belongs to 657 Gene ontolo - gy terms . In this paper we focused on 72 genes that belong to “angiogenesis” , “blood circulation” , “blood vessel development” and “blood vessel morphoge - nesis” GO BP terms , all of which were upregulated . These sets of genes were subjected to hierarchical clusterization procedure and presented as heatmaps ( Fig . 1 ) .

The enrichment of each GO BP term was calculated as z - score and shown on the circle diagram ( Fig . 2 ) In Gene Ontology database , genes that formed one particular GO group can also belong to other different GO term categories . By this reason we have explored the gene intersections between selected GO BP terms . The relation between those GO BP terms was presented as circle plot ( Fig . 3 ) as well as heat - map ( Fig . 4 ) . STRING interaction network was generated among differentially expressed genes belonging to each of selected GO BP terms . Using such prediction method provided us with molecular interaction ne - twork formed between protein products of studied genes ( Fig . 5 ) . Discussion Oviductal functions are well established in repro - ductive process , through facilitating successful em - bryo growth and conception [ 4 ] . The oviduct of the domestic mammals plays a crucial role in providing optimal microenvironment for final gamete matura - tion and transport , fertilization , and early embryo development , all serving to deliver a competent and healthy conceptus to the endometrium [ 5 ] . Oviduct activity is orchestrated by various factors , depend - ing on cyclic dynamics , which crucially affect the success of reproductive function . Moreover , these main functions of oviduct are highly based on its contractibility and the capacity for secreting ovi - ductal fluid into the lumen . Other oviductal compo - nents include hormones , growth factors and their receptors [ 6 , 7 ] . Epithelial oviductal cell lines may be a valuable tool for better understanding and elucidating many biochemical pathways existing in oviducts . Our pre - vious studies have shown various aspects of OECs’ morphological modifications and transcriptom - ic profile changes during in vitro cultivation [ 8 , 9 ] . Therefore , employing a microarray approach in our study , we aimed to investigate the transcriptomic profile of OECs during long - term in vitro primary cell culture . From all genes shown in this manu - script , belonging to the five GOs related to the for - mation of new vessels , six of them ( VEGFA , SLIT2 , EDNRA , EPAS1 , DDAH1 and NPR1 ) were a common element for all groups and showed the same direc - tion of expression changes during cultivation . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) is the main regulator of angiogenesis , inducing endothe - lial cell proliferation , migration , vascular perme - ability , and vessel lumen formation [ 10 ] . In pigs , 7 isoforms of VEGFA have been confirmed , with pre - dominant role of VEGF120 and VEGF164 isoforms in the female reproductive tissues [ 11 ] . The VEGF system includes the VEGF isoforms ( VEGFA ) and both the Flt - 1 ( VEGFR - 1 ) and Flk - 1 / KDR ( VEGFR - 2 ) tyrosine kinases , which are high - affinity VEGF re - ceptors [ 10 ] . The female reproductive system un - dergoes many angiogenic changes during each cycle . Previous studies have confirmed that the vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) system is crucial FIGURE 2 The circle plot showing the differently expressed genes and z - score “angiogenesis” , “blood circulation” , “blood vessel development” and “blood vessel morphogenesis” GO BP terms . The outer circle shows a scatter plot for each term of the fold change of the assigned genes . Red circles display up - regulation and blue ones down - regulation .

Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 191 for the regulation of ovarian [ 12 ] , endometrial [ 13 ] , and placental [ 14 ] angiogenesis . Furthermore , our previous work also showed significant changes in VEGFA mRNA expression levels in the oocyte - cumu - lus complexes ( COCs ) during cell culture [ 15 ] . These examples indicate that VEGF system may be postu - FIGURE 3 The representation of the mutual relationship 10 most upregulated and 10 most downregulated genes that be - longs to the “angiogenesis” , “blood circulation” , “blood vessel development” and “blood vessel morphogenesis” GO BP terms .

The genes were sorted by logFC from most to least changed gene FIGURE 4 Heatmap showing the gene occurrence between differently expressed genes that belongs to “angiogenesis” , “blood circulation” , “blood vessel development” and “blood vessel morphogenesis” GO BP terms .

Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 192 lated as a key factor involved in the local regulation of potential changes in the microvasculature and a mediator of microvascular permeability in the fe - male reproductive organs of mammals . Lam labora - tory characterized the expression dynamics of VEG - FA , Flt - 1 and KDR in women’s oviducts throughout the estrous and menstrual cycles [ 16 ] . These stud - ies confirmed different roles of two VEGF receptors in the oviduct ( pivotal role of KDR in oviduct angio - genesis , whereas flt - 1 appears to be important in the temporal regulation of oviductal secretion ) [ 16 ] . Małysz - Cymborska et al . described the influence of insemination and treatment with human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) and equine chorionic gonado - tropin ( eCG ) on expression of the VEGF system in porcine oviducts [ 17 ] . These study showed that in - semination alone as well as ovarian stimulation af - fected the mRNA and protein profiles of the VEGF system in the porcine oviduct . Other investigators , also employing a pig model , demonstrated more comprehensive analysis by characterizing the gene expression , protein levels and localization of the components of VEGF system in the oviduct through - out the porcine estrous cycle [ 18 ] . The investigators described in detail a differential VEGFA , Flt - 1 and KDR expression profile observed depending on the oviduct portion , the stage of the estrous cycle and the histological layer . Other research , using equine oviduct explant culture model , have not observed differences in transcript expression levels of VEGFA between Day 0 and Day 6 of culture [ 19 ] . Our re - search , as mentioned above , indicates a higher level of expression during the cell culture . Efficient process of vascular morphogenesis re - quires numerous ligands and transcription factors that support the activity of vascular endothelial growth factor’s family . Our studies indicated sim - ilar pattern of mRNA expression for three genes that have just such an auxiliary function to VEGFs . Neuropilin 1 ( NRP1 ) plays an important role in FIGURE 5 STRING - generated interaction occurrence between differently expressed genes that belongs to “angiogene - sis” , “blood circulation” , “blood vessel development” and “blood vessel morphogenesis” GO BP terms . The intensity of the edges reflects the strength of interaction score Nawrocki et al . Medical Journal of Cell Biology ( 2018 ) 193 signaling and vascular morphogenesis . Lanahan et al . found that mice with a knock - in mutation that ablates the NRP1 cytoplasmic tail ( Nrp1 cyto ) ex - hibit normal angiogenesis but impaired develop - mental and adult arteriogenesis [ 20 ] . The effect of VEGFA - induced angiogenesis is enhanced with in - creased expression of NRP1 co - receptor [ 20 ] . Oth - er studies indicated that both placental NRP1 and VEGF were consequently expressed at lower levels in women with pre - eclampsia [ 21 ] . Pre - eclampsia ( PE ) is a clinically important complication during pregnancy , strongly associated with abnormal pla - centation , endothelial dysfunction and imbalance between pro - angiogenesis and anti - angiogenesis [ 22 ] . Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase type 1 ( DDAH1 ) polymorphisms can also play a sig - nificant role in PE susceptibility [ 23 ] . DDAH enzyme family plays a role in the regulation of nitric oxide synthesis and release [ 24 ] . EPAS1 ( Endothelial PAS Domain Protein 1 ) is the third of mentioned genes , involved in regulation of VEGF expression , seemingly implicated in the development of blood vessels [ 25 ] . Mammals have at least three SLIT homologs genes ( SLIT1 , SLIT2 , and SLIT3 ) , which control ret - inal axon guidance based on their patterns of ex - pression within the developing visual system [ 26 ] . Slits signal though Roundabout ( ROBO ) receptors to play a role in axon guidance and attraction / re - pulsion of cell migration . In tumorigenesis , SLIT2 attracts vascular endothelial cells and promotes tumor - induced angiogenesis in multiple cancers including those of the reproductive system [ 27 , 28 ] . Additionally , SLIT2 mediates directional migration of malignant cells [ 29 ] . SLIT2 / ROBO1 signaling plays an important role in placental angiogenesis during normal pregnancy . Hence , investigators an - alyzed the expression and localization of the SLITs and ROBOs in the oviducts , endometrium [ 30 ] and in human tubal placenta [ 31 ] . The SLIT2 / ROBO1 signaling pathway was investigated as potential factor which may predispose to ectopic tubal preg - nancy [ 30 , 31 ] . SLIT2 overexpression promoted vas - cular remodeling by increasing the diameter of the maternal blood sinusoids and fetal capillaries [ 31 ] . In our studies , endothelin receptor type A ( ED - NRA ) also showed increased expression in cells during long - term cultivation , and was included in all discussed GO BP terms associated with the process - es of blood vessel formation . The endothelin fam - ily contains three 21 amino acid peptides ( EDN1 , EDN2 , and EDN3 ) , which bind to two endothelin receptors , A and B ( EDNRA and EDNRB ) [ 32 ] . EDN1 and EDN2 bind to both EDNRA and EDNRB , where - as EDN3 only binds to EDNRB [ 33 ] . The endothe - lin family was originally found as a group of potent vasoactive peptides , regulating vascular tone and blood pressure [ 33 ] . Nevertheless , endothelin par - ticipates in various biological processes in the re - productive system including luteolysis , contraction of myometrium and rupture of the follicle in several mammalian species [ 33 , 34 ] . Other studies indicat - ed that endothelins play a pivotal role in creating optimal oviductal microenvironment , by affecting smooth muscle motility and epithelial NO synthesis [ 35 ] . General application defining the roles of these proteins in the functioning of the fallopian tubes has been made by Jeoung et al . and suggest that en - dothelins are required by the oviduct to facilitate fertilization and early embryonic development [ 36 ] .
