Introduction Eukaryotic cells sense chemoattractants using transmem - brane receptors . When receptors detect attractants , they activate intracellular second messengers that relay information to the molecules that drive cell movement . One principal group of attractants , including cAMP in Dictyostelium discoideum and fMLP in mammalian neutrophils , act through on G proteins . Receptors with bound attractant cause G proteins to split from heterotrimers into active GTP - bound  subunits and  sub - units , and these free subunits in turn activate further intracel - lular messengers . In cells such as neutrophils , with a vast range of receptors , this process simplifies the cell’s responses by lim - iting the number of active species that cause intracellular ef - fects . In D . discoideum , one of the best organisms for studying chemotaxis ( King and Insall , 2009 ; Cai and Devreotes , 2011 ) , this simplification is even clearer : there are single genes for  and  subunits ( Wu et al . , 1995 ; Zhang et al . , 2001 ) , and the  subunit is thought to mediate most responses . Thus , in theory all attractants ( for example , cAMP and folate ) should elicit funda - mentally similar chemotaxis ( Srinivasan et al . , 2013 ) . However folate chemotaxis is often difficult to measure , for reasons ex - plored in this paper . Cells can be steered using many mechanisms . In shal - low gradients , the migration process is fundamentally random , and attractants can bias multiple features of the normal mo - tility cycle , for example the direction of new protrusions after pseudopod splitting ( Bosgraaf and Van Haastert , 2009 ) , and the probability of old pseudopods being retracted ( Andrew and In - sall , 2007 ) . However , the second messengers that are used are still not understood . In one model , phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( PIP 3 ) is a “compass needle” ( Bourne and Weiner , 2002 ) ; intracellular signal processing somehow resolves the ideal future direction of the cell , resulting in local generation of PIP 3 by the p110 phosphatidylinositide 3 - kinase ( PI 3 - kinase ) family . Discrete patches of PIP 3 appear at the leading edge of some cells during chemotaxis ( Postma et al . , 2004 ) , which sug - gests that these represent the outcome of a nonlinear response , perhaps by discretizing spatial information to control protru - sion ( Cai and Devreotes , 2011 ) . However , newer data have shown that PIP 3 is not essential for chemotaxis in D . discoideum I n eukaryotic chemotaxis , the mechanisms connecting external signals to the motile apparatus remain unclear . The role of the lipid phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphos - phate ( PIP 3 ) has been particularly controversial . PIP 3 has many cellular roles , notably in growth control and mac - ropinocytosis as well as cell motility . Here we show that PIP 3 is not only unnecessary for Dictyostelium discoideum to migrate toward folate , but actively inhibits chemotaxis . We find that macropinosomes , but not pseudopods , in growing cells are dependent on PIP 3 . PIP 3 patches in these cells show no directional bias , and overall only PIP 3 - free pseudopods orient up - gradient . The pseudopod driver suppressor of cAR mutations ( SCAR ) / WASP and verpro - lin homologue ( WAVE ) is not recruited to the center of PIP 3 patches , just the edges , where it causes macropino - some formation . Wild - type cells , unlike the widely used axenic mutants , show little macropinocytosis and few large PIP 3 patches , but migrate more efficiently toward folate . Tellingly , folate chemotaxis in axenic cells is res - cued by knocking out phosphatidylinositide 3 - kinases ( PI 3 - kinases ) . Thus PIP 3 promotes macropinocytosis and interferes with pseudopod orientation during chemotaxis of growing cells . PIP 3 - dependent macropinocytosis is incompatible with chemotaxis Douwe M .

T H E J O U R N A L O F C E L L B I O L O G Y JCB • VOLUME 204 • NUMBER 4 • 2014 498 nutrients ( Swanson , 2008 ) . The mutations that allow axenic growth have been mapped to three separate loci , but their iden - tity remains unknown ( Clarke and Kayman , 1987 ) . The use of axenic D . discoideum strains is so widespread that they are often , incorrectly , referred to as wild - type cells . In this work we show an unexpected conflict between chemotaxis and macropi - nocytosis that raises fundamental questions about the physio - logical role of PIP 3 . Results and discussion Axenic D . discoideum cells are defective in chemotaxis to folate The main reason for studying chemotaxis in model organisms like D . discoideum is to find simple but generalizable results . It is therefore desirable to study multiple attractants to separate global from agonist - specific mechanisms . We have therefore studied chemotaxis toward folate . Compared with the well - studied cAMP system , folate uses different receptors and G protein  subunits ( Srinivasan et al . , 2013 ) , which are expressed in grow - ing cells that are not responsive to cAMP . However it has been difficult to measure folate chemotaxis with most assays ( though under - agar and some micropipette assays succeed ) . To discover why , we exposed AX2 cells to folate gradients in a standard chemotaxis chamber ( Muinonen - Martin et al . , 2010 ) . Under these conditions , starved cells chemotax efficiently toward cAMP . However , growing cells consistently failed to migrate up the fo - late gradient ( Fig . 1 A ) . This was surprising , as folate is thought to be a potent attractant . To analyze the problem , we switched to using wild - type NC4 , the parent strain of AX2 , which does not have axenic mutations and must thus be grown on bacteria . In contrast to axenic cells , wild - type cells robustly migrated up the folate gradient ( Fig . 1 B ) . AX2 cells grown on bacteria also show a little chemotaxis ( Fig . 1 C ) , but still far less than NC4 , which indicates that the loss of folate chemotaxis is caused by genetic differences between the wild type and the axenic AX2 strain . Actin , pseudopod orientation , and PIP 3 This defect in a strain that is widely used to study motility and chemotaxis is worrying , so we determined its cause . Chemoat - tractants steer cells by altering pseudopod behavior , so we mea - sured pseudopod directions in axenic and nonaxenic cells . We also examined PIP 3 because of its clear association with both macropinocytosis during axenic growth and chemotaxis . Cells were transfected with Lifeact - mRFP ( Riedl et al . , 2008 ) and PH - CRAC - GFP ( Parent et al . , 1998 ) to show actin pseudopods in red and PIP 3 in green . We first determined the fraction of F - actin – rich protru - sions labeled with PIP 3 during random migration ( as observed by others , the PIP 3 - positive and - negative populations were essen - tially discrete , allowing an all - or - nothing score ) . In axenically cultivated AX2 cells ,  50 % of random protrusions accumulate PIP 3 at the edge ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . In AX2 grown on bacteria , PIP 3 - containing pseudopods are only about half as frequent , though these cells migrate more efficiently . ( Hoeller and Kay , 2007 ) or in neutrophils ( Ferguson et al . , 2007 ) . This , among other data , has led to alternate models such as the pseudopod - centered model ( Insall , 2010 ) , in which mul - tiple signaling processes act by biasing a normal , random pseu - dopod cycle . Despite this , the concept of a chemotactic compass ( perhaps operating through an alternative second messenger ) and a central role for PIP 3 in chemotaxis are frequently cited in the literature . More recently , PIP 3 has been strongly associated with macro - pinocytosis ( Posor et al . , 2013 ) , in which cells use actin - driven cups to endocytose large volumes of liquid . Macropinosomes are induced by growth factors such as PDGF in mammalian cells , and the small GTPase Ras , which directly activates PI 3 - kinases , causes massive macropinocytosis when it is inappro - priately activated ( Commisso et al . , 2013 ) . Thus , macropinocy - tosis and PIP 3 are associated . Macropinocytosis also occurs in D . discoideum . In the wild , cells feed by phagocytosing bacteria . However , most lab - oratory work is done in axenic strains ( “axenic” in this case means “able to grow in the absence of living prey” ) . These strains have been selected by growth in medium without bacte - ria , and are able to grow because of a constitutive high rate of macropinocytosis . D . discoideum macropinosomes are large structures ( up to 5 µm ) that efficiently take up liquid and soluble Figure 1 . Folate chemotaxis is inefficient in axenic cells .

JCB • VOLUME 204 • NUMBER 4 • 2014 500 Expression of PIP 3 markers in wild - type cells It has previously not been practical to express ectopic genes in wild - type D . discoideum because standard selectable mark - ers and promoters work poorly in bacterially grown cells . We constructed new vectors to allow expression of markers for PIP 3 and F - actin in wild - type cells , and developed methods for trans - fection and selection using bacteria as food ( see Materials and methods ) . We successfully cotransfected NC4 cells with Lifeact - mRFP and PH - CRAC - GFP to examine the distribution of F - actin and PIP 3 . To our surprise , however , PIP 3 - containing pseudopods were extremely rare in randomly moving wild - type cells ( Fig . 2 B ) ; 98 % of pseudopods had no discernible PIP 3 . Thus , in growing wild - type D . discoideum , unlike in axenic cells , PIP 3 appears not to be used at all in random migration , even though the cells migrate far more robustly . PIP 3 and folate chemotaxis We next examined PIP 3 during folate chemotaxis . Cells were exposed to a relatively steep folate gradient in a chemotaxis chamber , and the angle between each protrusion and the gradi - ent was determined . As before , axenic AX2 cells did not show chemotaxis . The mean cosine of the angle between the protru - sions and the chemoattractant gradient was close to zero , which indicates no alignment , regardless of whether PIP 3 was present . Also , protrusions with PIP 3 made a negligible contribution to net migration ( Fig . 2 , C , D , and E ) . Macropinosomes were not oriented by the folate gradient ( Fig . 2 F ) . As before , AX2 cells grown on bacteria chemotaxed weakly , and the proportion of pseudopods with PIP 3 patches decreased substantially ( from 63 % to 29 % ; Fig . 2 E ) . Further - more , PIP 3 - labeled protrusions did not orient up the gradient ( Fig . 2 E ) . In contrast , the protrusions that showed no discern - ible PIP 3 oriented up the folate gradient with a mean cosine of 0 . 40 . Thus , unexpectedly , absence of PIP 3 patches correlated with improved chemotaxis . During chemotaxis , pseudopods in vegetative wild - type cells were still almost never labeled with PIP 3 ( Fig . 2 E ) . In a folate gradient , the protrusions of wild - type cells showed high directionality ( mean cosine 0 . 59 ) despite the lack of PIP 3 at the front ( Fig . 2 , C and D ) . Thus , in all conditions we observed , only PIP 3 - negative pseudopods are directed by folate . PIP 3 and macropinocytosis in wild - type and axenic cells The negative correlation between the number of PIP 3 patches and the chemotaxis efficiency was unexpected , as PIP 3 signal - ing is thought to be fundamentally involved in directional sens - ing . However , PIP 3 is involved in several other physiological processes , in particular macropinocytosis ( Dormann et al . , 2004 ; Hoeller et al . , 2013 ) . We speculated that this could negatively impact chemotaxis efficiency , and we therefore examined macro - pinocytosis and its regulation by PIP 3 in more detail . In wild - type cells , macropinocytosis could readily be vi - sualized with the PIP 3 marker PH - CRAC - GFP ( Fig . 3 A ) , de - spite the substantially lower rate of fluid uptake . The PIP 3 is strictly confined to the nascent vesicle ; levels increase during invagination and reach a maximum as the vesicle closes . The entire process is very fast , with a mean time of 8 s between ap - pearance of PIP 3 and budding of the vesicle ( n = 27 , SD = 4 s ) . Macropinosomes in wild - type cells are small and do not con - tribute to cell movement , and are readily distinguishable from the large , convex , and spiky F - actin pseudopods . Unlike wild - type cells , axenic AX2 cells generate macro - pinosomes from preassembled PIP 3 patches . The PI 3 - kinases re - sponsible for this process have recently been analyzed in depth ( Hoeller et al . , 2013 ) ; the patches are presumably the structures organized by PIKs 1 and 2 . The diameter of the patches is a Figure 3 . PIP 3 patches organize macropinosomes .

This corresponds with Video 1 . ( D ) Kymograph of a line drawn through the protrusion in C . 501 PIP 3 inhibits folate chemotaxis • Veltman et al . Collectively , these data indicate that PIP 3 marks membrane regions that are destined for invagination during axenic growth . In axenic cells , this results in a complex pattern of inward and out - ward movement of the membrane , which combines with F - actin to mediate both macropinocytosis and a subset of cell movement . Inverse correlation between macropinocytosis and chemotaxis We assessed the relationship between macropinocytosis and chemotaxis by altering the macropinocytic rate . Axenically grown AX2 cells form FITC - labeled vesicles at a rate of 0 . 44 / min ( Fig . 5 A ) . However , AX2 cells that have been cultivated on bacteria have a diminished rate of macropinocytosis . Macropino - somes in NC4 cells are even rarer , with a mean rate of 0 . 05 / min . These changes correlate with the efficiency of chemotaxis to - ward folate ( Fig . 5 A ) . Folate chemotaxis is robust under a sheet of agarose ( for example Laevsky and Knecht , 2001 ; and Blagg et al . , 2003 ) . We examined whether the difference between under - agar and cham - ber assays was connected with changes in macropinocytosis . Surprisingly , macropinocytosis in vegetative axenic cells is al - most completely blocked under agar , with the number of mac - ropinosomes dropping below those in nonaxenic cells ( Fig . 5 A ) . It is not clear why physical constraint causes such a large sup - pression of macropinocytosis , but it is reminiscent of the induc - tion of autophagy by compression ( King et al . , 2011 ) . However , the effect on chemotaxis is clear : axenic cells become chemo - tactic when macropinocytosis is blocked under agarose despite being nonchemotactic when unrestricted . Loss of PI 3 - kinase blocks macropinocytosis and rescues migration and folate chemotaxis The inverse correlation between macropinocytosis and chemo - taxis raises an interesting conflict . Despite the belief that PIP 3 is fundamental to chemotaxis , we have found that PIP 3 - driven macropinocytosis is not consistent with chemotaxis to folate . We therefore examined a strain lacking all five PI 3 - kinases ( Hoeller and Kay , 2007 ) . These cells have no PIP 3 patches , and their axenic growth is slow due to a defect in macropinocyto - sis ( Hoeller et al . , 2013 ) . In our hands , the rate of macropino - cytosis of PI 3 - kinase – null cells was only 0 . 05 / min , similar to that of nonaxenic cells . However , chemotaxis toward folate was greatly improved ( Fig . 5 A ) . Bacterially grown AX2 migrated toward folate with a weak chemotaxis index of 0 . 23 and a speed of 5 . 6 µm / min ; knocking out all the PI 3 - kinases restored this to 0 . 44 and 19 . 1 µm / min , respectively ( Fig . 5 B ) . Similarly , 10 µM LY294002 , enough to inhibit PI 3 - kinase without blocking the target of rapamycin ( TOR ) complex , significantly diminished macropinocytosis and increased cell speed ( Fig . S2 ) . Thus , it appears that PIP 3 is not only inessential for folate chemotaxis in D . discoideum , but actively opposes it . Axenic mutations , macropinocytosis , and chemotaxis Our data clearly show that PIP 3 patches are not used at all by cells chemotaxing to one of the two principal attractants used substantial fraction of the size of the cell ( Fig . 3 B ) . Progres - sion of negative curvature to drive vesicle formation frequently stalls , causing patches to remain planar or slightly inwardly curved for prolonged periods of time . Moreover , PIP 3 patches often disappear without any vesicle formation , which indicates that macropinocytosis was aborted . The PIP 3 patches that are involved in axenic macropinocy - tosis are a similar size to pseudopods and recruit large amounts of F - actin . Nascent macropinosomes are therefore difficult to discriminate from pseudopods , especially if they abort before vesicle formation . This is further complicated because pseu - dopods and macropinosomes are able to interconvert . Fig . 3 C and Video 1 show an example . The protrusion is initially free of PIP 3 and resembles a normal pseudopod . At 20 s , a PIP 3 patch appears at the leading edge , and shortly after , negative curvature is induced at the site of the patch . The image plainly resembles a forming macropinocytic cup . However , it does not fully close and aborts after 80 s . A kymograph of this event ( Fig . 3 D ) shows that the forward movement of the leading edge reduces after the appearance of PIP 3 . Suppressor of cAR mutations ( SCAR ) and F - actin organization in macropinosomes The ambiguous character of these actin structures in axenic cells complicates analysis . To more accurately distinguish the potential role of PIP 3 in pseudopods and macropinosomes , we examined the behavior of the SCAR / WASP and verprolin homologue ( WAVE ) complex , which is the definitive marker for pseudopods . It remains associated with the leading edge throughout the progression of a pseudopod and disappears from the leading edge when the pseudopod stops advancing ( Fig . 4 A ; Hahne et al . , 2001 ; Veltman et al . , 2012 ) . Inter - estingly , high concentrations of PIP 3 do not colocalize with the SCAR complex , which is recruited to a small margin sur - rounding each patch ( Fig . 4 , B – D ; and Video 2 ) . This distribu - tion is not only visible in the PIP 3 patches that develop to form macropinosomes , but also in ones that remain planar and that cannot readily be classified as either a pseudopod or a nascent macropinosome ( Video 1 and Fig . 4 B , asterisk ) . We were unable to find any event where a PIP 3 patch was followed by recruitment of SCAR to the leading edge in the fashion that is typical for pseudopods . A close - up view demonstrates the complexity of the mac - ropinocytic cup . The region labeled with PIP 3 remains static , with little movement perpendicular to the membrane ( Fig . 4 E , green dots ) . SCAR remains associated with the rim of the cup throughout the event . The SCAR - containing region moves out - ward and drives closure of the cup ( Fig . 4 E , other dots ) . This outward movement at the edge of the PIP 3 patch can generate cell movement , though it is retarded by the slow movement at the center of the PIP 3 patch . It is also clear that the edge of the patch is a major site of actin filament nucleation ( Fig . 4 F ) . The Lifeact - mRFP signal overlies the PIP 3 , though it is strongest at the extremities ( Fig . 4 G ) , and there is a clear difference be - tween the edges and the center ; the SCAR - labeled edges are rough and their thickness is variable , like pseudopods , whereas the central F - actin is thinner and smooth . JCB • VOLUME 204 • NUMBER 4 • 2014 502 that PI 3 - kinases are not required for chemotaxis . What was a surprise , however , was that PIP 3 actually opposes folate che - motaxis . Folate and cAMP mostly use the same signaling by D . discoideum cells . Thus , at the very least , PIP 3 is not a uni - versal player in chemotaxis . This is not a surprise , as a great deal of data has accumulated over the past six years showing Figure 4 . SCAR , actin , and PIP 3 in pseudo - pods and macropinosomes .

Graphs of the collected angle data were generated in MATLAB ( Math - Works ) . Statistical analysis was done using the Circular Statistics Toolbox ( Berens , 2009 ) . Chemotaxis assays Chemotaxis assays were performed on an inverted microscope ( Eclipse TE2000 ) using a 10× phase contrast objective lens ( NA 0 . 3 ) . The micro - scope was controlled using Micromanager ( Edelstein et al . , 2010 ) . Insall chambers ( Muinonen - Martin et al . , 2010 ) were used to expose cells to a chemoattractant gradient of 0 – 100 µM folate across a bridge that was 1 mm wide . Typically , a recording of 60 min was captured , starting im - mediately after the assembly of the chemotaxis chamber . The position of at least 20 randomly selected cells in each recording was determined every minute using the ImageJ plugin mTrackJ ( Meijering et al . , 2012 ) . The chemotaxis index of the population was calculated for each time components , in particular the single G protein  subunit , which is thought to mediate most of the responses downstream of chemoattractant receptors . The key difference is therefore not likely to be in signaling pathways , but rather the developmen - tal stages of the cells . While cells are growing , axenic mutations lead to massive , PIP 3 - driven macropinocytosis , which is clearly inconsistent with chemotaxis . Starved axenic cells cease macro - pinocytosis and thus regain chemotaxis at the time they become sensitive to cAMP . The identity of the axenic mutations is not yet known , but it will be fascinating to unravel their influence on chemotaxis at all stages . This may fundamentally alter our understanding of chemotaxis in D . discoideum and metazoan cells . Materials and methods Cell strains and cultivation D . discoideum AX2 cells were used as an axenic strain and NC4 cells were used as nonaxenic , wild - type cells . The PI3 kinase quintuple knockout strain HM1200 ( Hoeller and Kay , 2007 ) was obtained from the Dicty Stock Center . For axenic growth , cells were cultivated on Petri dishes under HL5 medium ( ForMedium ) . Nonaxenic cultivation was done on Petri dishes under SorMC buffer supplemented with live Klebsiella aerogenes at an OD 600 of 2 . SorMC buffer consists of 15 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 2 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 50 µM MgCl 2 , and 50 µM CaCl 2 , pH 6 . 0 . To reduce autofluorescence of axenically cultivated cells in preparation for fluorescence microscopy , cells were incubated overnight in LoFlo medium ( ForMedium ) . For microscopy , cells were put on a 3 . 5 - cm acid - washed glass - bottom MatTek dish . DNA constructs and transfection In brief , the act6 promoter driving the resistance marker of the modular pDM expression vector set ( Veltman et al . , 2009 ) was replaced by the coaA promoter ( bp  293 to bp  1 relative to the start codon of coaA ) . The PIP 3 - binding PH domain of cytoplasmic regulator of adenylyl cyclase ( CRAC ; residue 1 – 126 of the protein encoded by dagA ) was used as a PIP 3 sensor . Full - length HSPC300 was used as a marker for the SCAR com - plex , and Lifeact ( Riedl et al . , 2008 ) was used as a marker for filamentous actin . Gene fragments were cloned into the BglII – SpeI site of the expression vector . For coexpression of two genes the shuttle vector was used as de - scribed previously ( Veltman et al . , 2009 ) . avGFP S65T and mCherry were used for fluorescence labeling . Transfection of nonaxenic cells was performed as follows : 5 × 10 6 cells were harvested from the plate , washed once in SorMC buffer , and resuspended in 400 µl SorMC buffer . Cells were mixed with 5 µl mini - prep DNA (  0 . 5 – 1 µg total ) and put on ice . Cells were then electropor - ated at 500 V using the high - voltage setting of an ECM 399 Exponential Decay Wave Electroporation System ( Harvard Apparatus ) and immedi - ately transferred to a Petri dish with SorMC buffer and live K . aerogenes at an OD 600 of 2 . Selection marker was added after 5 h ( 10 µg / ml G418 or 100 µg / ml hygromycin ) . Microscopy and image analysis All microscopy was performed at room temperature . Confocal laser scan - ning microscopy was performed on a confocal microscope ( A1R ; Nikon ) using a 1 . 4 NA Plan - Apochromat 60× oil immersion objective lens and the manufacturer’s NIS Elements acquisition software ( Nikon ) . Total internal re - flection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy was performed on an inverted mi - croscope ( Eclipse TE2000 - U ; Nikon ) that was fitted with a custom TIRF condenser and a 1 . 45 NA 100× Plan - Apochromat TIRF objective lens . Red and green fluorescent signals were separated using a beam splitter and projected onto an EM charge - coupled device camera ( Evolve512 ; Photo - metrics ) . MetaMorph software was used to control the camera , shutters , and light sources . Spinning disk confocal microscopy was performed on an Andor system using an Eclipse Ti body ( Nikon ) fitted with a Plan - Apo - chromat VC 100× oil immersion objective lens ( NA 1 . 4 ) . Images were captured on a Neo 5 . 5 sCMOS camera using the manufacturer’s iQ soft - ware ( both from Andor Technology ) . Fluorescence images were analyzed using the standard tools avail - able in ImageJ . Images were not processed other than brightness / contrast adjustments and bleach correction for mRFP in Video 2 .

Cell Sci . 117 : 2925 – 2935 . http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1242 / jcs . 01143 point using a custom - written Excel ( Microsoft ) spreadsheet that uses the following formula : CI t t a t a t i i in i in ( ) = ( ) ⋅ ( ) ( ) = = ∑ ∑ cos θ 1 1 where n is the number of cells analyzed , cos  ( t ) i is the cosine of the angle between the displacement vector of cell i and the direction of the gradient at time point t , and a ( t ) i is the length of the displacement vector of cell i at time point t . The chemotaxis index of the population is then plotted over time and a 40 - min window is selected where the chemotaxis is optimal . Typically , this would exclude the start of the recording , where the gradient has not yet stabilized , and sometimes the end of the recording , when the chamber dried out and the gradient collapsed . The mean chemotaxis index of the population was then calculated as follows : CI CI a n a n population t t t t t t t = ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ = = ∑ ∑ 140 140 where CI t is the mean CI of the cells at time point t , a t is the mean displace - ment of the cells at time point t , and n t is the number of analyzed cells at time point t . The chemotaxis indices shown are the means of the population means of at least three experiments ± the standard error . Quantification of the rate of macropinocytosis Cells were seeded onto an acid - washed glass - bottom dish . The medium was supplemented with 800 µg / ml FITC - dextran . For the under - agarose condition , cells were overlaid with a 1 - mm thick slab of 0 . 8 % agarose in LoFlo medium + 800 µg / ml FITC - dextran . Cells were allowed to equilibrate for 20 min . A 15 - min recording was made , simultaneously capturing the fluorescent FITC signal and the corresponding differential interference con - trast ( DIC ) image on a line - scanning confocal microscope . Frames were taken every 2 . 5 s and across three different z planes spanning a total of 4 µm . Individual uptake events of fluorescent dextran were then identified by eye using both the data from the fluorescence channel and the DIC channel ( see Fig . S1 ) . Macropinosome and speed experiment and quantification Cells expressing Lifeact - mRFP were harvested in growth phase and centri - fuged for 5 min at 400 g , then resuspended in LoFlo medium at a titer be - tween 0 . 5 × 10 6 and 10 6 cells / ml , and 0 . 5 ml was added to a glass - bottom dish ( Bioptechs , Inc . ) . Cells were incubated for 3 h to allow growth medium to be exported and then imaged every 20 s for 40 min on a confocal mi - croscope ( A1R ; Nikon ) as described in the Microscopy and image analysis section . LY294002 was added to a final concentration of 10 . 8 μM and im - aging was continued . Macropinosome quantification was done by counting the number of internalized macropinosomes ( circular and Lifeact - mRFP labeled ) formed in 30 min in each cell ( n = 31 ) . Cells were also tracked for speed , before and after LY294002 addition using the ImageJ and the MTrackJ plugin . Online supplemental material Fig . S1 shows the detailed process for determination of the rates of mac - ropinocytosis . Fig . S2 shows that moderate levels of LY294002 , an inhibi - tor of PI 3 - kinases and PIP 3 accumulation , cause axenically growing cells to migrate faster and macropinocytose more slowly . Video 1 shows a PIP 3 patch inducing a negative ( i . e . , concave ) curvature at the leading edge , unlike a normal pseudopod that shows positive / convex curvature . Video 2 shows that the SCAR complex , the principal driver of pseudopod exten - sion , is only recruited to the edges , not the center , of PIP 3 patches .
