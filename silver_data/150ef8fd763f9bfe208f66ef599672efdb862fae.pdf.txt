De - fects in this process lead to aneuploidy , a common feature of cancer cells and the cause of many develop - mental diseases [ 1 – 4 ] . One of the major microtubule - binding activities in the kinetochore is mediated by the conserved Ndc80 complex ( Ndc80c ) [ 5 – 7 ] . In budding yeast , the retention of kinetochores on dynamic micro - tubule tips also depends on the essential heterodecameric Dam1 complex ( Dam1c ) [ 8 – 15 ] , which binds to the Ndc80c and is proposed to be a functional ortholog of the metazoan Ska complex [ 16 , 17 ] . The load - bearing activity of the Dam1c depends on its ability to oligomerize , and the puriﬁed complex spontaneously self - as - sembles into microtubule - encircling oligomeric rings , which are proposed to function as collars that allow kinetochores to processively track the plus - end tips of microtubules and harness the forces generated by disassembling microtubules [ 10 – 15 , 18 – 22 ] . However , it is unknown whether there are speciﬁc regulatory events that promote Dam1c oligomerization to ensure accurate segregation . Here , we used a reconstitution system to discover that Cdk1 , the major mitotic kinase that drives the cell cycle , phosphorylates the Ask1 component of the Dam1c to increase its residence time on microtubules and enhance kinetochore - microtu - bule attachment strength . We propose that Cdk1 activity promotes Dam1c oligomerization to ensure that kinetochore - microtubule attachments are stabilized as kinetochores come under tension in mitosis . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Phosphorylation of the Native Dam1c Strengthens Kinetochore - Microtubule Attachments To measure the contribution of the Dam1 complex ( Dam1c ) to the strength of tip - bound kinetochore - microtubule attachments , we used an in vitro reconstitution system . Wild - type kinetochore par - ticleswerepuriﬁed frombudding yeast cellsbyimmunoprecipitat - ing Dsn1 , a conserved kinetochore protein ( Figure S1 ) [ 23 ] . To obtain kinetochore particles lacking the Dam1c , we used dad1 - 1 cells that contain a temperature - sensitive mutant in the Dam1c component Dad1 [ 24 ] . We conﬁrmed that kinetochore particles puriﬁed from dad1 - 1 cells ( referred to as Dad1 - 1 kineto - chores ) grown at the non - permissive temperature lack the Dam1c , but otherwise retain the major core kinetochore compo - nents ( Figure S1 ) . To test the biophysical coupling strength of the Dad1 - 1 kinetochores to microtubule tips , we used an optical trap to exert tension on kinetochore - microtubule attachments . Kinetochore particles were linked to polystyrene microbeads that were captured in a laser trap and then placed at the plus ends of dynamic microtubules that were grown from microtubule seeds tethered to a slide ( Figure1A ) . Oncea kinetochore - microtu - bule interaction was established , tensile force was applied and then gradually increased until the kinetochore ruptured from the microtubule tip [ 19 , 23 , 25 ] . To compare Dad1 - 1 versus wild - type kinetochores , we measured rupture forces for many individ - ual kinetochore particles of each type ( Figure 1B ) . For each pop - ulation , the fraction of attachments that survived up to a given level of force was plotted and the mean rupture force was also calculated . Wild - type kinetochores ruptured over a range of forces , with a mean strength of 9 . 4 piconewtons ( pN ) ( Figures 1B and 1D ) . Dad1 - 1 kinetochores were substantially weaker Current Biology 30 , 1 – 9 , November 16 , 2020 ª 2020 The Author ( s ) .

Their rupture force distribution was shifted to lower values and their mean strength was only 3 . 4 pN , consistent with previous measurements [ 19 , 23 ] . To determine whether the reduced strength of the Dad1 - 1 kinetochores was solely due to the lack of the Dam1c , we puriﬁed recombinant Dam1c ( rDam1c ) from bacteria and performed add - back experiments [ 19 ] . When we introduced soluble rDam1c into the optical trapping assay with the kinetochore - bound beads , it rescued the strength of Dad1 - 1 kinetochores partially , increasing the average rupture force from 3 . 4 to 5 . 6 pN ( Figures 1C and 1D ) , as observed previ - ously [ 19 ] . One possible reason for the lack of a full rescue was that the recombinant complex lacked key post - translational mod - iﬁcations . To test this , we puriﬁed native Dam1c ( nDam1c ) from yeast cells and performed the same experiment . In contrast to rDam1c , the addition of nDam1c to Dad1 - 1 kinetochores fully restored kinetochore - microtubule attachment strength , increasing the mean rupture force to 9 . 1 pN ( Figures 1C and 1D ) . This observation suggests that the native complex carries key modiﬁcations that contribute to its ability to hold microtubule tips under force and that are lacking on rDam1c . Because the Dam1c is known to have multiple activities regu - lated by phosphorylation [ 10 , 15 , 25 – 36 ] , we tested whether phosphorylation was responsible for the higher kinetochore - microtubule attachment strength observed with nDam1c relative to rDam1c . We treated puriﬁed nDam1c with phosphatase ( l ) to remove phosphorylation or with phosphatase plus inhibitors ( l + inh ) as a control . The migration of the Ask1 protein increased af - ter phosphatase treatment ( Figure 1E , silver - stained SDS - PAGE ) , indicating successful dephosphorylation . We then tested the activity of the dephosphorylated nDam1c in add - back as - says as described above . As expected , the control - treated nDam1c fully rescued the Dad1 - 1 kinetochore particles , bringing their rupture strength up to 8 . 8 pN on average ( Figures 1E and 1F ) . In contrast , the phosphatase - treated nDam1c only partially restored the mean rupture force to 5 . 7 pN , similar to rDam1c ( Figures 1E and 1F ) . Taken together , these data indicate that Dam1c phosphorylation promotes stable kinetochore - microtu - bule attachments . Although this result was surprising given that Aurora B phosphorylation of the Dam1 component of the complex is known to weaken the interaction between Figure 1 .

Cdk1 - Mediated Phosphorylation of Ask1 Enhances Kinetochore - Microtubule Attachment Strength To further assess the role of Dam1c phosphorylation , we sought to identify the speciﬁc phosphorylation sites on nDam1c that contribute to kinetochore - microtubule attachment strength . The predominant migration shift of the puriﬁed Dam1c by silver - stained SDS - PAGE occurs on the Ask1 protein ( Figure 1E , right ) . Ask1 phosphorylation increases as cells pro - ceed into mitosis due to the major mitotic kinase Cdk1 ( Cdc28 in S . cerevisiae ) , although the function of this phosphorylation is not known [ 34 , 37 , 38 ] . We therefore tested whether Cdk1 ac - tivity is required for nDam1c activity in the optical trap assay . To do this , we treated wild - type cells or those containing an analog - sensitive allele of Cdk1 ( cdc28 - as1 ) with the analog 1 - NM - PP1 to speciﬁcally inhibit Cdk1 in the cdc28 - as1 cells [ 38 , 39 ] prior to purifying nDam1c . Visualization of Ask1 on sil - ver - stained SDS - PAGE showed that it migrated farther when puriﬁed from the analog - sensitive strain compared to wild type , indicating that the inhibitor worked and was speciﬁc to cdc28 - as1 cells ( Figure 2A , right ) . We assayed the activity of the Dam1c puriﬁed from these two strains in add - back assays and found that the control nDam1c fully rescued Dad1 - 1 kinet - ochore particles , to an average rupture force of 9 . 2 pN , but nDam1c puriﬁed from cdc28 - as1 cells only partially rescued the mean rupture force to 7 . 1 pN ( Figures 2A and 2B ) . We ob - tained similar results when nDam1c was puriﬁed from a tem - perature - sensitive mutant Cdk1 strain , cdc28 - 13 [ 40 ] ( Fig - ure S2 ) . Taken together , these data suggest that Cdk1 phosphorylation is required for the full contribution of the Dam1c to kinetochore - microtubule attachment strength . How - ever , additional phosphorylation on the Dam1c may contribute to the interaction strength because the Dam1 complexes lack - ing Cdk1 - mediated phosphorylation strengthened attach - ments more than rDam1c .

To test the importance of the Cdk1 sites in Ask1 , we mutated both residues to alanine ( Ask1 - 2A ) to block Cdk1 - mediated phosphorylation . We then puriﬁed nDam1c from yeast cells ex - pressing ask1 - 2A as the sole copy of the gene and tested this mutant complex ( nDam1c Ask1 - 2A ) in our add - back optical trap assay . nDam1c Ask1 - 2A partially rescued the rupture force of Dad1 - 1 kinetochores to 6 . 9 pN ( Figures 2C and 2D ) , which is similar to the strength measured with nDam1c puriﬁed from cells lacking Cdk1 activity . These results indicate that Cdk1 phos - phorylation of one or both Ask1 sites is required for full Dam1c - dependent strengthening , and that additional Cdk1 - in - dependent phosphorylation of the Dam1c partially contributes to its function . Consistent with this idea , Ask1 phospho - mutants retained some Ask1 phosphorylation because phosphatase treatment increased their mobility by SDS - PAGE ( Figure S3 ) . To further analyze the role of Cdk1 phosphorylation of Ask1 , we tested whether nDam1c containing phospho - mimetic muta - tions in the Cdk1 target sites on Ask1 ( nDam1c Ask1 - 2D ) could rescue the rupture force of the Dad1 - 1 kinetochores . The Dam1c was puriﬁed from ask1 - 2D cells and added back to the optical trap assay . nDam1c Ask1 - 2D fully rescued the rupture force to the wild - type level of 9 . 4 pN ( Figures 2C and 2D ) . To test whether phosphorylation on the Cdk1 sites is sufﬁcient for full Dam1c activity , we phosphatase treated nDam1c Ask1 - 2D prior to analysis in the optical trap assay . Remarkably , the phospha - tase - treated nDam1c Ask1 - 2D was fully functional and rescued Dad1 - 1 kinetochores to 8 . 8 pN ( Figures 2C and 2D ) . Therefore , although additional phosphorylation on nDam1c appears to contribute to its activity , Cdk1 - mediated phosphorylation of Ask1 appears to be sufﬁcient for the Dam1c to fully support kinetochore - microtubule attachments . To further test whether Cdk1 phosphorylation of the Dam1c is sufﬁcient to fully restore the strength of kinetochore - microtubule attachments to Dad1 - 1 kinetochores , we directly phosphory - lated rDam1c with Cdk1 . This led to a shift in the migration of Ask1 , indicating the kinase reaction worked ( Figure 2E , silver - stained SDS - PAGE ) . We added phosphorylated rDam1c to Dad1 - 1 kinetochores and performed the optical trap assay . Phosphorylated rDam1c fully rescued the rupture force to 9 . 3 pN ( Figures 2E and 2F ) , suggesting that Cdk1 phosphorylation is sufﬁcient to fully restore rDam1c activity . To test whether Cdk1 phosphorylation of Ask1 was the only relevant substrate , we assayed phospho - mimetic rDam1c ( rDam1c Ask1 - 2D ) and found that it fully rescued the rupture force to 8 . 6 pN ( Figures 2E and 2E ) . To verify there are no additional contributing Cdk1 phosphorylation sites on the Dam1c , we phosphorylated rDam1 - c Ask1 - 2D with Cdk1 . There were no further migration shifts on the Ask1 protein after the Cdk1 kinase reaction when compared to Ask1 - 2D ( Figure 2E , silver - stained SDS - PAGE ) . Consistent with this , the Cdk1 - phosphorylated rDam1c Ask1 - 2D rupture force was 8 . 8 pN , which is similar to untreated rDam1c Ask1 - 2D ( Figures 2E and 2F ) . Together , these data strongly suggest that even though other phosphorylation on the Dam1c might strengthen kinetochore - microtubule attachments , Cdk1 phosphorylation of the Ask1 protein is sufﬁcient to fully restore the strength of kinetochore - microtubule attachments to Dad1 - 1 kinetochores . Ask1 Phospho - regulation Is Important for Accurate Chromosome Segregation We next asked whether Cdk1 phosphorylation of the Dam1c af - fects chromosome segregation in vivo . Although previous work found that the single - and double - phospho - mutants of Ask1 do not exhibit major growth defects , they were never analyzed for chromosome stability [ 34 ] . To assess chromosome segrega - tion , we performed a quantitative chromosome transmission ﬁ - delity assay , or sectoring assay [ 41 , 42 ] . This strategy utilizes a non - essential chromosome fragment III ( CFIII ) whose loss can be detected and quantiﬁed by a change in the color of the yeast cells . Both the ask1 - 2A and ask1 - 2D cells exhibited a signiﬁcant increase in chromosome loss , with the ask1 - 2A cells exhibiting an eight - fold increase in chromosome missegregation compared to wild type ( Figure 3A ) . Because both a lack of phos - phorylation as well as a phospho - mimetic mutant of Ask1 lead to chromosome loss , it appears important that Dam1c phosphory - lation is dynamically regulated in vivo . To further characterize the role of Ask1 phosphorylation , we asked whether defects in its regulation exhibit genetic interactions with mutations in other Dam1c components . We made double mutants containing the dam1 - 9 allele that is mildly temperature sensitive in our strain background and assayed serial dilutions for growth at a semi - permissive temperature [ 43 ] . Whereas all of the single mutants were able to grow at 37 (cid:1) C , the dam1 - 9 ask1 - 2A cells were invi - able ( Figure 3B ) . To determine whether kinetochore function is affected in the double - mutant cells , we examined kinetochore biorientation in metaphase - arrested cells . The centromere of chromosome III was ﬂuorescently marked by the binding of GFP - LacI to Lac operators [ 44 ] . When kinetochores biorient and come under tension , two centromere foci can be visualized . However , the practical resolution limit of the light microscope prevents us from visualizing separated foci unless they are at least 0 . 3 mm apart , so we were only able to resolve 28 % of kinet - ochores as two bioriented foci in wild - type cells at 37 (cid:1) C . Howev - er , only 15 % of dam1 - 9 cells had two foci and this further decreased to 2 % of the dam1 - 9 ask1 - 2A mutants ( Figure 3C ) , suggesting these cells have a kinetochore biorientation defect . These data are consistent with phosphorylation of the Dam1c promoting kinetochore function in vivo . Ask1 Phosphorylation Appears to Facilitate Dam1c Oligomerization We next sought to address how Ask1 phosphorylation enhances Dam1c function to promote kinetochore - microtubule attach - ment strength . It was previously shown that Dam1c interacts with the kinetochore - microtubule - binding component Ndc80 to promote its association with microtubules , at both the lattice and at the plus - end tips [ 8 , 10 , 18 ] . In addition , Cdk1 phosphor - ylation of the vertebrate Ska complex directly promotes its inter - action with Ndc80c [ 45 , 46 ] . We therefore tested whether phos - phorylation enhances the interaction between the Dam1c and the kinetochore - bound Ndc80c , but we found that the interac - tion was similar in the presence or absence of microtubules regardless of the phosphorylation state ( Figure S4 ) . The Dam1c initially contacts microtubules as a monomer and then an estimated 17 individual complexes oligomerize into a ring around microtubules [ 47 ] , so we next tested whether phos - phorylation promotes either of these activities using single - ll OPEN ACCESS 4 Current Biology 30 , 1 – 9 , November 16 , 2020 Please cite this article in press as : Gutierrez et al . , Cdk1 Phosphorylation of the Dam1 Complex Strengthens Kinetochore - Microtubule Attachments , Current Biology ( 2020 ) , https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . cub . 2020 . 08 . 054 Report molecule total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy [ 11 , 18 , 48 – 50 ] . First , we tested whether phosphorylation pro - motes the initial binding of Dam1c monomers to the lattice of the microtubule . To do this , we monitored the binding of single monomers on individual , Taxol - stabilized microtubules using a concentration of puriﬁed rDam1c ( 50 pM ) that was low enough to prevent its oligomerization [ 15 ] ( Figure 4A ) . We measured the residence times of the ﬂuorescently labeled wild - type rDam1c Ask1 - GFP and phospho - mimetic rDam1c Ask1 - 2D - GFP monomers on the microtubules and found that they behaved identically ( Figures 4B and 4C ) , indicating that phosphorylation does not directly affect the interaction between microtubules and Dam1c monomers . Next , we tested whether Ask1 phos - phorylation alters Dam1c oligomerization . To do this , we mixed a higher concentration of non - ﬂuorescent ‘‘dark’’ rDam1c ( 1 nM ) , which promotes Dam1c oligomerization on the microtu - bules , together with a small amount of ﬂuorescent ‘‘tracer’’ rDam1c ( 50 pM ) , to enable observation of individual monomers under these conditions ( Figure 4D ) . It has previously been demonstrated that the residence times for individual , ﬂuores - cence - tagged , microtubule - binding subcomplexes are increased when they hetero - oligomerize with other , non - ﬂuores - cent microtubule binders [ 19 , 29 , 51 ] . We therefore mixed wild - type dark rDam1c Ask1 with the wild - type tracer rDam1c Ask1 - GFP and found that the mean residence time of rDam1c Ask1 - GFP was 8 s ( Figures 4E and 4F ) , which is an (cid:3) 2 - fold increase over the residence time of rDam1c Ask1 - GFP alone ( Figures 4B and 4C ) . This increase in residence time is due to the formation of oligomers that bind more stably to the microtubules than mono - mers [ 19 ] . Strikingly , the residence time was more substantially increased , by 3 - fold , when phospho - mimetic rDam1c Ask1 - 2D was used instead of wild - type rDam1c Ask1 ( Figures 4E and 4F ) . This observation strongly suggests that phosphorylation of Ask1 promotes oligomerization of the Dam1c . Although the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic prevented us from attempting additional assays to analyze oligomerization , we note that previous studies demonstrated that increased residence time in the TIRF assay correlates with oligomerization when also assayed by electron microscopy [ 19 , 29 , 51 ] . To test whether the enhanced oligomerization of the Dam1c in vitro has a role in vivo , we analyzed cell growth in the presence of benomyl , a microtubule - destabilizing drug . Whereas wild - type and ask1 - 2A cells had difﬁculty growing on plates contain - ing benomyl ( Figure 4G ) , ask1 - 2D cells survived . These data sug - gest that microtubules are stabilized in ask1 - 2D cells , consistent with enhanced Dam1c oligomerization around the microtubule . We next tested whether Ask1 phosphorylation can suppress de - fects in oligomerization induced by Aurora B - dependent phos - phorylation of another subunit of the Dam1c , the Dam1 protein . It was previously found that Aurora B - mediated phosphorylation of Dam1 - S20 inhibits Dam1c oligomerization in vitro [ 29 ] . Consistent with this prior discovery , dam1 - S20D cells were benomyl sensitive but the addition of the ask1 - 2D mutation sup - pressed the benomyl sensitivity ( Figure 4G ) . This suppression in - dicates that the effect of ask1 - 2D opposes that of dam1 - S20D in vivo , consistent with our ﬁnding that Ask1 - 2D appears to pro - mote oligomerization in vitro , whereas phosphorylation of Dam1 - S20 inhibits oligomerization . Taken together , these data strongly suggest that Cdk1 phosphorylation of Ask1 promotes oligomer - ization of the Dam1c in a cell - cycle - dependent manner to ensure accurate chromosome segregation . The Dam1c promotes chromosome segregation through mul - tiple functions that include directly binding to microtubules , inter - acting with the Ndc80 kinetochore complex , and oligomerizing Figure 3 .

Here , we identify a key phospho - regulatory mechanism that appears to promote Dam1c oligomerization to preserve the attachment of kinetochores to dynamic microtubules . Although it was previ - ously known that Cdk1 phosphorylates the Ask1 component [ 34 ] , the underlying function of the modiﬁcations was not known . Using biophysical techniques , we found that Cdk1 phosphoryla - tion appears to promote the oligomerization of the Dam1c and does not affect the ability of the Dam1c to bind to microtubules , to the Ndc80c , or to kinetochores . Cdk1 phosphorylation of the Ska complex [ 45 , 46 ] is also known to promote kinetochore func - tion , consistent with it having functions analogous to the Dam1c [ 17 , 55 ] . However , the underlying mechanism is different because the Ska complex does not appear to oligomerize around microtubules and Cdk1 phosphorylation enhances its direct interaction with the Ndc80c [ 45 , 46 ] . Although a high - res - olution structure of the Dam1c was recently solved using cryoe - lectron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) [ 47 ] , the C - terminal portion of Ask1 that contains the Cdk1 phosphorylation sites was not present in the structure . However , crosslinking data suggest that the C - terminal region of Ask1 that contains the Cdk1 phos - phorylation sites can interact with a second Dam1c monomer through Spc34 [ 29 ] , bringing up the possibility that phosphoryla - tion promotes this interaction . Future structural work will be required to elucidate the underlying contacts that are enhanced by phosphorylation to determine whether it alters intra - or inter - complex interactions . Accurate chromosome segregation requires that every pair of sister kinetochores biorients and attaches to microtubules from opposite poles . However , early in mitosis , kinetochores initially make random attachments to microtubules , which results in some pairs of sister kinetochores that are attached to the same pole instead of opposite poles . These incorrect kinetochore - microtubule attachments must be destabilized , and previous work showed that phosphorylation of the Dam1c by the Aurora B protein kinase facilitates this process [ 10 , 15 , 25 – 30 , 33 , 56 ] . As mitosis proceeds and kinetochores make proper attachments to microtubules , the attachments must be stabilized to resist the tension that is generated by biorientation . While it has been Figure 4 . Ask1 Phosphorylation Promotes Dam1c Oligomerization ( A ) Schematic of the TIRF assay used to analyze Dam1c monomer binding to microtubules . Dam1c binds to microtubules as a monomer at low con - centrations ( 50 pM ) .

Our work suggests that Dam1 oligomerization is regulated through the cell cycle by Cdk1 phosphorylation , providing a mechanism to couple oligo - merization to cell - cycle progression . We propose that Cdk1 phosphorylates the Dam1c later in mitosis , after Aurora B phosphorylation , to prevent premature stabilization of incorrect attachments . As mitosis proceeds , the global increase in Cdk1 activity will promote oligomerization as cells establish proper kinetochore - microtubule attachments and help maintain them as they come under tension . Oligomerization may also help kinet - ochores maintain processive attachments as cells subsequently undergo anaphase . However , there is less force on kinetochores during anaphase , so it is unclear whether phosphorylation on Ask1 is required for anaphase . Because Cdk1 phosphorylation isreversed bytheCdc14phosphatasein budding yeast , it islikely that Cdc14 activityinhibitsoligomerization . Inthiscase , the phos - phorylation sites may not be accessible to phosphatase activity until anaphase is complete . Because cells containing mutants that abolish Ask1 phosphorylation or mimic constitutive phos - phorylation exhibit chromosome missegregation , the dynamics of oligomerization appear to be critical for accurate mitosis . In the future , it will be important to determine when Ask1 dephos - phorylation occurs and what additional regulatory events control Dam1c oligomerization as well as what other vital kinetochore functions are mediated by Cdk1 kinase activity .

Yeast were cultured in standard yeast extract peptone dextrose ( YPD ) medium at 23 (cid:1) C unless indicated otherwise . Strains used in this study are listed in Key Resources Table . METHOD DETAILS Strain construction : Yeast Strains and Plasmids Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study are derived from or backcrossed to SBY3 to be isogenic with the W303 back - ground and are listed in Key Resources Table . All strains containing the following epitope - tagged genes are generated by standard PCR - based integration techniques at the endogenous loci as described in [ 61 ] and are fully functional . Primer sequences are listed in Table S3 . DSN1 - 6His - 3Flag is described in [ 23 ] . DAD1 - 3V5 was made with primers SB4448 and SB4449 and template plasmid pSB2047 . DAD1 - 3Flag was made with primers SB4214 and SB4215 and template plasmid pSB1265 . MTW1 - CLIP was made with primers SB3109 and SB3111 and template plasmid pSB1824 . DAD1 - SNAP - 3V5 as made with primers SB5091 and SB5092 and template plasmid pSB2402 . CDC28 - 3V5 was made with primers SB5892 and SB5893 and template plasmid pSB2068 . The dam1 - S20D mutant originates from David Drubin’s lab ( DDY2486 ) [ 28 ] and was backcrossed to SBY3 . Dam1 - S20D strains were derived from SBY3720 and were used in previous work [ 25 ] . ASK1 plasmids were constructed as follows . ASK1 was ampliﬁed by PCR using a primer containing sequence upstream of the ASK1 gene and a recognition site for the restriction enzyme XhoI ( SB5468 ) and a primer downstream of the ASK1 stop codon with a recognition site for the restriction enzyme EagI ( SB5469 ) . The PCR product and a LEU2 integrating vector ( pSB2223 ) were digested with XhoI and Eag1 and ligated to create pSB2900 . This plasmid was used as a template to make site directed mutations at ASK1 - S216 and S250 , switching serine to alanine ( pSB2904 ) by site directed mutagenesis with primers SB5602 and SB5604 or altering serine to aspartic acid ( pSB2905 ) with primers SB5603 and SB5605 . All plasmids were veriﬁed by sequencing . The non - essential yeast chromosome fragment strain was a gift of the Kim Nasmyth ( YPH278 ) [ 59 ] and backcrossed to W303 . Cdc28 - as1 was a gift from the Shokat lab and backcrossed into the W303 strain and used in [ 23 ] . Construction of ASK1 mutant strains at the LEU2 locus The following steps created strains in which ask1 mutants were integrated at the LEU2 locus and the endogenous ASK1 gene was deleted . First , a heterozygous ASK1 / ask1 diploid strain was generated ( SBY17818 ) by deleting one copy of ASK1 by PCR integration with PCR product produced with primers SB5523 and SB5524 and template plasmid pSB54 as described in [ 61 ] . The ASK1 deletion was veriﬁed by PCR with primers SB5532 and SB5121 and then subsequently by tetrad dissection that resulted in 2 : 2 viability . The various ASK1 plasmids ( plasmids pSB2900 , pSB2904 , and pSB2905 , described above ) were digested with SwaI and transformed into SBY17818 to integrate them at the LEU2 locus and then dissected to identify the correct genotypes . Protein biochemistry Native kinetochores and kinetochore subcomplexes were puriﬁed from either conditionally treated or asynchronously grown cells . Cells containing cdc28 - as1 were grown to OD 600 0 . 6 - 1 . 0 and then arrested in G1 with alpha factor ( 1 m g / mL in DMSO ) for 3 hr , and at 2 . 5 hr the compound 1 - NM - PP1 ( 0 . 5 m M in DMSO ; Toronto Research Chemical , A603003 ) was added . Cells were washed twice to remove alpha - factor with equal volumes of YPD containing 0 . 5 m M of 1 - NM - PP1 . Cells were then resuspended in YPD with 5 . 0 m M of 1 - NM - PP1 for 2 - 2 . 5 hr before cells were harvested . Cells from the cdc28 - 13 temperature sensitive strain were shifted to the non - permissive temperature ( 37 (cid:1) C ) for 2 . 5 hr before harvesting . Protein lysate was prepared by lysing cells with a magnetic impact bar submerged in liquid nitrogen using a Freezer / Mill ( SPEX SamplePrep ) . Lysed cells were resuspended in buffer H ( BH ) ( 25 mM HEPES pH 8 . 0 , 2 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 mM EGTA , 0 . 1 % NP - 40 , 15 % glycerol with 150 mM KCl for native kinet - ochores ) containing protease inhibitors ( at 20 m g / mL ﬁnal concentration for each of leupeptin , pepstatin A , chymostatin and 200 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride ) and phosphatase inhibitors ( 0 . 1 mM Na - orthovanadate , 0 . 2 m M microcystin , 2 mM b - glycer - ophosphate , 1 mM Na pyrophosphate , 5 mM NaF ) followed by ultracentrifugation at 24 , 000 RPM for 90 min at 4 (cid:1) C . Lysates were incubated with a - Flag or a - V5 conjugated dynabeads for 3 hr with constant rotation at 4 (cid:1) C [ 23 ] . For kinetochore puriﬁcation , Dsn1 - 6His - 3Flag strains were used . For the native yeast Dam1 complex puriﬁcation , Dad1 - 3Flag or Dad1 - 3V5 was puriﬁed . For re - combinant Dam1 complex , Spc34 - Flag ( used in Phosphorylation Kinase Assays below ) was used and for yeast Cdk1 , Cdc28 - 3V5 was used . Samples were washed three times with BH containing protease inhibitors , phosphatase inhibitors , 2 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) and either 150 mM KCl ( for kinetochore puriﬁcations ) or 400 mM KCl ( for Dam1 complex puriﬁcations ) . Beads were further washed twice with BH containing 150 mM KCl and protease inhibitors . Associated proteins were eluted from the beads by gentle agitation of beads in elution buffer ( 0 . 5 mg / mL 3Flag peptide or 0 . 5 mg / ml 3V5 peptide in BH with 150 mM KCl and protease inhibitors ) for 20 - 30 min at room temperature . Eluted samples were used or snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at (cid:4) 80 (cid:1) C . Phosphatase treatment Yeast lysates were incubated with Dynabeads conjugated with a - Flag or a - V5 antibodies to immobilize Dam1c and separate it from the cell lysate ( described above in Protein biochemistry ) . Prior to elution from the beads , the Dam1c was incubated for 30 min with ll OPEN ACCESS e3 Current Biology 30 , 1 – 9 . e1 – e5 , November 16 , 2020 Please cite this article in press as : Gutierrez et al . , Cdk1 Phosphorylation of the Dam1 Complex Strengthens Kinetochore - Microtubule Attachments , Current Biology ( 2020 ) , https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . cub . 2020 . 08 . 054 Report lambda phosphatase at 30 (cid:1) C ( BH 0 . 15 , 1 mM MnCl2 , 22 units - Lambda Protein Phosphatase ; New England Biolabs , P0753L ) . Control samples contained phosphatase inhibitors . The Dam1c was then washed and eluted as described above . Immunoblot and silver stain analysis For immunoblot analysis , cell lysates were prepared as described above ( Protein biochemistry section ) . Protein samples were sepa - rated using pre - cast 4 % – 12 % or 10 % Bis Tris Protein Gels ( Thermo - Fisher ) and standard procedures for sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) and immunoblotting were followed as described in [ 23 ] . A 0 . 45 m m nitrocellulose membrane ( BioRad ) was used to transfer proteins from polyacrylamide gels . Commercial antibodies used for immunoblotting were : a - Flag , M2 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) 1 : 3 , 000 ; a - GFP , JL - 8 ( Living Colors ) 1 : 5 , 000 ; a - Myc , 9E10 ( Covance ) 1 : 10 , 000 ; A polyclonal a - Dam1c antibody was generated by injecting recombinant Dam1c into rabbits at Paciﬁc Immunology ( Ramona , CA ) . The serum was then used 1 : 500 . The secondary antibodies used were a sheep a - mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) ( GE Life sciences ) at a 1 : 10 , 000 dilution or a donkey a - rabbit antibody conjugated to HRP ( GE Life sciences ) at a 1 : 10 , 000 dilu - tion . Antibodies were detected using the Super Signal West Dura Chemiluminescent Substrate ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) . For analysis by silver stain , the gels were stained with Silver Quest Staining Kit ( Invitrogen ) . In vitro binding assays To examine the binding of Dam1c to Dad1 - 1 kinetochores , Dam1c was ﬁrst ﬂuorescently labeled . Dam1c ( Dad1 - SNAP - 3V5 ) was puriﬁed as described above and then incubated in buffer containing SNAP - Surface 647 dye ( 10 m M in BH 0 . 15 M KCl and phospha - tase and protease inhibitors ) for 30 min with continuous gentile agitation while immobilized on beads . The excess dye was washed away with three washes of BH 0 . 15 M KCl and protease inhibitors and then the Dam1c was eluted . To test the interaction of Dam1c with kinetochores , the Dad1 - 1 kinetochores was also ﬂuorescently labeled using CLIP - surface 547 dye and puriﬁed as described above and immobilized on a - Flag dynabeads . They were incubated with three - fold dilutions of puriﬁed Dam1c ( starting at 9 ng ) in buffer BH 0 . 15 M KCl and phosphatase and protease inhibitors for 30 min at room temperature with continuous gentile agitation . Beads were then washed three times with BH containing 150 mM KCl and protease inhibitors . Kinetochore bound to beads were eluted as described above . Phosphorylation kinase assays Yeast lysates were incubated with Dynabeads conjugated with a - V5 antibodies to isolate Cdk1 ( Cdc28 - 3V5 ) from the cell lysate and it was subsequently eluted from beads ( described above in Protein biochemistry ) . Soluble Cdk1 was then incubated for 30 min with soluble rDam1c ( Spc34 - Flag ) in MOPS Assay Buffer ( MAB ) for 30 min at room temperature with continuous agitation ( MAB , 25 mM MOPS , 15 mM MgCl2 , 5 mM EGTA ) containing protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors with 0 . 8 mM ATP . Control sam - ples excluded Cdk1 . Samples were then incubated with Dynabeads conjugated with a - Flag antibodies to immobilize the rDam1c , which was then washed and eluted as described above and either analyzed by silver stain SDS - PAGE or added to the optical trap at 2 nM as described below . Spotting assay and chromosome loss assay For the spotting growth assay , the desired strains were grown overnight in YPD medium . The following day , cells were serially diluted 5 - fold and spotted on YPD or YPD + Benomyl ( 7 . 5 m g / mL ) . Plates were incubated at 23 (cid:1) C for 3 days or 37 (cid:1) C for 2 days . The chro - mosome loss assay techniques are described in [ 41 ] . Brieﬂy , strains were grown on - URA plates to ensure selection for the chromo - some fragment . The following day , the strains were diluted in water and spread onto YPD plates containing a ﬁfth fold dilution of adenine ( Adenine 0 . 001 % ) . Cells were diluted to obtain about 200 colonies / plate and then grown at 23 (cid:1) C for 7 - 12 days before placing them at 4 (cid:1) C for 2 - 3 days . Total colonies and colonies with red sectoring were counted . Analysis of kinetochore biorientation Cells were arrested in metaphase by repressing CDC20 , an activator of the anaphase promoter complex ( APC ) , using the methionine promoter ( pMET3 ) that is conditionally suppressed by methionine . Cells were ﬁrst grown at room temperature in media lacking methi - onine to OD 600 (cid:3) 0 . 3 and then shifted to 37 (cid:1) C in the presence of CuSO4 ( see below ) and methionine to arrest cells in metaphase . Strains also carried an integrated tandem array of LacO sequences at centromere III and a pCUP1 - lacI - GFP fusion that was induced by the addition of 0 . 25 mM CuSO4 . Following 2 . 5 hours of incubation , cells were harvested and ﬁxed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde in 100 mM phosphate buffer ( pH 6 . 4 ) for 5 - 10 minutes . Cells were washed once with 100 mM phosphate ( pH 6 . 4 ) , resuspended in 100 mM phosphate , 1 . 2 M sorbitol buffer ( pH 7 . 5 ) and permeabilized with 1 % Triton X - 100 containing 2 m g / ml DAPI ( 4’ , 6 - diami - dino - 2 - phenylindole ; Molecular Probes ) . Cells were imaged using a Nikon E600 microscope with a 60X objective ( NA = 1 . 40 ) . Five Z stacks ( 0 . 3 micron apart ) were acquired and all frames with nuclear signal in focus were maximally projected . NIS Elements soft - ware ( Nikon ) was used for image acquisition and processing [ 62 ] . Recombinant protein expression and puriﬁcation All ten S . cerevisiae Dam1 complex subunits were expressed in E . coli ( BL21 Rosetta 2 ; Novagen , Madison , WI ) from a single poly - cistronic vector [ 18 ] . The complex was afﬁnity puriﬁed using a C - terminal 6xHis - tag or Flag - tag on Spc34p , and subjected to gel ﬁltra - tion , as previously described [ 15 , 33 , 51 , 57 ] . For TIRF microscopy experiments , the Dam1 complex was tagged with a C - terminal ll OPEN ACCESS Current Biology 30 , 1 – 9 . e1 – e5 , November 16 , 2020 e4 Please cite this article in press as : Gutierrez et al . , Cdk1 Phosphorylation of the Dam1 Complex Strengthens Kinetochore - Microtubule Attachments , Current Biology ( 2020 ) , https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . cub . 2020 . 08 . 054 Report GFP tag on Dad1 protein . The S . cerevisiae Ndc80 complex was expressed in E . coli , using a C - terminal 6xHis - tag before being sub - jected to gel ﬁltration , as previously reported [ 15 , 51 , 63 , 64 ] . TIRF microscopy Flow chambers were constructed using glass slides and functionalized coverslips as reported before [ 15 , 33 ] . Coverslips were adhered to a glass slide with double - sided tape , to form individual ﬂow channels between two adjacent strips of tape . ‘Rigor’ kinesin was added to each channel to nonspeciﬁcally bind to the coverslip . This allowed for the addition and immobilization of taxol - stabi - lized microtubules . 50 pM GFP - tagged Dam1c Ask1 or Dam1c Ask1 - 2D was used to test the direct binding of the Dam1c to microtu - bules . For testing oligomerization on microtubules , an additional 1 nM of the untagged Dam1 complex was incubated . For testing the interaction between the Dam1 and Ndc80 complexes , 50 pM GFP - tagged Ndc80 complex was incubated alone or in the pres - ence of 5 nM untagged Dam1c Ask1 or Dam1c Ask1 - 2D to ensure Dam1 complex oligomerization . All TIRF assays were carried out in BRB80 ( 80 mM K - PIPES , 1 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM EGTA , pH 6 . 9 ) in the presence of oxygen scavenger system ( 200 mg / ml glucose ox - idase , 35 mg / ml catalase , 25mM glucose and 5mM dithiothreitol ) . Experiments using GFP - tagged Dam1 complex had an additional 0 . 8 mg / mL k - casein and 50mM KCl . Experiments using GFP - tagged Ndc80 complex had an additional 8 mg / ml BSA . Single particle tracking and analysis was carried out with custom software ( available on request and developed in LabVIEW ( National Instruments ) and Igor Pro ( Wavemetrics ) [ 15 , 19 , 33 , 65 ] . Mean residence times were carried out through bootstrapping analysis [ 19 , 51 ] . Each residence time dataset was randomly resampled with replacement . All the datasets presented formed normal distributions ; mean and standard deviation of the bootstrapped dataset are reported . The raw data is available in Data S1 . Optical trap assays Optical trap - based bead motility assays were performed as in [ 23 , 62 ] . Streptavidin - coated 0 . 56 - m m polystyrene beads ( Spherotech ) were functionalized with biotinylated anti - penta - His antibody ( QIAGEN ) and stored in BRB80 containing 8 mg / ml BSA and 1 mM DTT at 4 (cid:1) C with continuous rotation . Beads were decorated with puriﬁed kinetochores ( via Dsn1 - 6His - 3Flag ) in a total volume of 20 m L incubation buffer ( BRB80 containing 1 . 5 mg / mL k - casein ) . Kinetochore particles were diluted such that the concentration of Dsn1 - 6His - 3Flag was (cid:3) 0 . 4 ng / uL , and then incubated with 6 pM beads for 1 h at 4 (cid:1) C . For native Dam1c add back , kinetochores received a ﬁnal concentration of (cid:3) 2 nM . The concentration of rDam1c and nDam1c were obtained by comparing the intensity of Spc34 and Duo1 to dilutions of BSA standards on silver - stained SDS - PAGE using a standard curve . The BSA standards and its derived equation were run on the same gel for the calculated Dam1c concentrations . Kinetochores were incubated in the microtubule growth buffer ( see below ) . Dynamic microtubule extensions were grown from coverslip - anchored GMPCPP - stabilized microtubule seeds in a microtubule growth buffer consisting of BRB80 , 1 mM GTP , 250 m g / ml glucose oxidase , 25 mM glucose , 30 m g / mL cata - lase , 1 mM DTT , 1 . 4 - 1 . 5 mg / mL puriﬁed bovine brain tubulin and 1 mg / mL k - casein . Assays were performed at 23 (cid:1) C . Rupture force experiments were performed as in [ 23 , 62 ] . Brieﬂy , an optical trap was used to apply a force of (cid:3) 1 - 4 pN in the direction of microtubule assembly . Once beads were observed to track with microtubule growth for a distance of (cid:3) 100 - 300 nm ( to ensure end - on attach - ment ) , the applied force was increased at a constant rate of 0 . 25 pN / s until bead detachment . Records of bead position over time were generated and analyzed using custom software ( Labview and Igor Pro , respectively ) and used to determine the rupture force , which was marked as the maximum force sustained by the attachment during each event . All rupture force measurements are re - ported in Table S1 and all rupture force experiments were additionally analyzed using a log - rank test that is reported in Table S2 . QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Data was statistically analyzed using Graph Pad PRISM 7 and the error bars in all main ﬁgures and supplemental ﬁgures represent standard error mean of the mean ( SEM ) unless otherwise stated . N is the number of events or data points collected . p values for rupture force events were determined using a two - tailed unpaired t test and this was done for data in Figures 1 , 2 , and S2 . p values for survival plots / curves were analyzed using log rank test and this was done for data in Figure S4 . p values for quantitative chromo - some transmission ﬁdelity were determined using Student’s t test and this was done for data in Figure 3 . Error bars from standard deviation of two independent experiments is reported for the biorientation assay in Figure 3 . p values for residence time was deter - mined using a two - tailed unpaired t test this was done for data in Figures 4 and S2 . ll OPEN ACCESS e5 Current Biology 30 , 1 – 9 . e1 – e5 , November 16 , 2020 Please cite this article in press as : Gutierrez et al . , Cdk1 Phosphorylation of the Dam1 Complex Strengthens Kinetochore - Microtubule Attachments , Current Biology ( 2020 ) , https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . cub . 2020 . 08 . 054 Report
