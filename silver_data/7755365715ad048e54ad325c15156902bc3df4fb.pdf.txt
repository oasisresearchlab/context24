We aimed to identify the risk factors for infection among the household contacts of index patients and to determine the incubation period , serial interval , and estimates of secondary infection rate . Methods : We conducted a study in three districts of Kerala among the inhabitants of households of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) - positive coronavirus disease ( COVID - 19 ) patients between January and July 2021 . COVID - 19 - positive patients and corresponding contacts were enrolled and followed up for 28 days to determine RT - PCR positivity and the presence of total antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 on days 1 , 7 , 14 , and 28 from the date of enrolment . Results : The mean incubation period , serial interval , and generation time were 1 . 6 , 3 , and 3 . 9 days , respectively . The secondary infection rate was 43 . 0 % . Individuals who worked outside the home were protected , whereas those who had kissed the COVID - 19 - positive patients during illness were more than twice at risk of infection than those who had not kissed the COVID - 19 - positive patients . Similarly , the contacts who had shared a toilet with the COVID - 19 - positive patients were more at risk than those who had not shared a toilet . However , the contacts who reported using masks were at a higher risk of infection in household settings . Conclusions Assessment of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in household settings is important , considering its high secondary infection rate . Close physical contact and toilet sharing increase the risk of infection . This study demonstrates shorter incubation period and serial interval .
