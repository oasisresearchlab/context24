Mesenchymal migration is modulated by focal - adhesion proteins , which organize into large integrin - rich protein complexes at the basal surface of adherent cells . Whether the extent of clustering of focal - adhesion proteins is actually required for effective migration is unclear . We recently demonstrated that the depletion of major focal - adhesion proteins , as well as modulation of matrix compliance , actin assembly , mitochondrial activity , and DNA recombination , all converged into highly predictable , inter - related , biphasic changes in focal adhesion size and cell migration . Herein , we further discuss the role of focal adhesions in controlling cell spreading and test their potential role in cell migration . Introduction A myriad of proteins play a role in cell migration , including cytoskeletal , motor , mechanosensing , and scaffolding proteins as well as regulatory kinases and phospha - tases . In particular , a defined subset of cytoplasmic and membrane - bound pro - teins that cluster into focal adhesions at the basal surface of adherent cells regu - late cell migration , sensation of mechani - cal stimuli , signal transduction through the cell membrane , and cell adhesion . 1 - 3 Morphology and dynamics of focal Predicting how cells spread and migrate Focal adhesion size does matter Dong - Hwee Kim 1 , 2 and Denis Wirtz 1 , 2 , 3 , * 1 Johns Hopkins Physical Sciences - Oncology Center ; The Johns Hopkins University ; Baltimore , MD USA ; 2 Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering ; The Johns Hopkins University ; Baltimore , MD USA ; 3 Department of Oncology and Department of Pathology ; The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine ; Baltimore , MD USA adhesions , such as size , shape , molecu - lar density and activity , turnover rate , and spatial distribution , strongly depend on the cell type and matrix properties such as dimensionality , topology , and compliance . 3 - 7 Here a systems - biological approach uncovers a universal bipha - sic relationship between focal adhesion size and cell migration speed . 8 Based on this data , we found that focal adhesion size uniquely predicts cell adhesion and morphology . 9 - 11 Recapitulation of Biphasic Relationship Between Focal Adhesion Size and Cell Migration Speed Fast - moving fish keratocytes , human leu - kocytes , and Dictyostelium discoideum cells display small focal adhesions at their basal surface , while slow - moving fibroblasts and endothelial cells display large focal adhe - sions . 12 - 14 Therefore , a superficial compari - son among migratory cells suggests that cells that feature small focal adhesions migrate more rapidly than cells that fea - ture large focal adhesions . This disparate data suggests that the extent of clustering of focal - adhesion proteins into basal adhe - sion plaques would inversely correlate with cell migration . However , a rigorous assess - ment of the role of focal - adhesion cluster - ing in the migration of isotypic cells has been lacking . To assess the potential interplay between focal adhesion formation and cell migration , we measured the speed and persistence of migration of control © 2013 Lande s B i o sc i en c e . D o no t d i s t r i bu t e . 294 Cell Adhesion & Migration Volume 7 Issue 3 manipulated the expression and activity of proteins that were ( spatially and func - tionally ) progressively further away from focal adhesion complexes . For instance , disassembly of actin filaments to block actomyosin - mediating force relay 25 and depletion of the F - actin - crosslinking pro - tein α - actinin , which is functionally asso - ciated with force transduction between adhesion site and cytoskeleton , 26 , 27 induce changes in cell speed that are robustly predicted by corresponding changes in focal adhesion size . Deactivation of mito - chondria and DNA recombination , which cell migration speed were biphasically related ( Fig . 1D ) , i . e . , as focal adhesion size increased , cell moved more rapidly ; past a maximum threshold speed , cell migration decreased for increasing focal adhesion size . Importantly , neither the shape of focal adhesions , nor their num - ber or the relative cell surface occupied by focal adhesions , nor the molecular com - position of focal adhesions seems to pre - dict cell migration . 8 To test the predictive power of this biphasic relation between focal adhe - sion size and cell migration speed , we mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) and MEFs depleted of major focal adhe - sion proteins ( focal adhesion kinase , pax - illin , talin , and zyxin ) , spontaneously migrating on flat substrates of controlled mechanical compliance , and determined these cells’ ability to form focal adhesions . These proteins and mechanical stimuli were chosen because they were known to affect the organization of focal adhe - sions and / or modulate cell migration 15 - 24 ( Fig . 1A – C ) . High - throughput quantita - tive live - cell microscopy revealed that the mean size of focal adhesions and mean Figure 1 . Focal adhesion size is a unique predictor of cell migration speed .

At least 30 cells per condition were analyzed to assess focal - adhesion and cell morphol - ogy and > 50 cells per condition were tracked to assess cell motility . error bars represent SeM .

( D – F ) Assessment of regression among focal adhesion size , cell size , and cell speed . Mean size of focal adhesion is biphasically and linearly correlated with cell speed ( D ) and cell size ( E ) , respectively , while cell size is weakly correlated with cell speed either biphasi - cally ( r 2 = 0 . 51 ) or linearly ( r 2 = 0 . 32 ) . Gaussian ( nonlinear ) and linear models were tested to the data set ranged between 0 and 1 after normalization as ( x − x min ) / ( x max − x min ) . error bars represent SeM . note that cell size is not statistically related to cell speed .

Conclusions Through a validated correlative analy - sis between descriptors of focal adhesion morphology ( size , shape , and density ) and descriptors of cell migration , we have addressed a long - standing question in cell biology : whether morphology of focal adhesions is functionally related to cell migration . The power of such analysis is increased substantially by using a com - bination of genetic and mechanical per - turbations as well as blind tests . Results from this analysis show that : ( 1 ) the mean size of focal adhesions—not their shape or their number per cell—predicts cell migration across cell types and ( 2 ) the mean size of focal adhesions predicts cell spreading , while cell spreading does not predict cell migration . These results may have important implications in biomedical research : defects in organ and tissue development or disease resulting from the onset of or defects in cell migration may occur through misregulated changes in focal adhesion size . This provides for a concep - tually new pharmacological target of dis - ease : not a specific molecular target , but a morphological descriptor of an organ - elle—focal adhesion size .

Finally , the biphasic relationship established with MEFs was further validated with HT - 1080 cells , a highly tumorigenic human fibro - sarcoma cell line . Together these results establish that focal - adhesion size uniquely and robustly predicts cell migration across cell types and extracellular conditions . 8 The Interplay Between Cell Migration and Spreading The adhesion between an adherent cell and its underlying substrate regulates cell migration speed biphasically . 31 Cell - matrix adhesion strength may depend on the contact area between the cell and its adhesive substrate ( i . e . , cell spreading size ) , 32 cell mechanics and contractil - ity , 33 the level of expression and activa - tion of adhesion molecules ( integrins ) , 34 and presumably , their extent of clustering into focal adhesions , and the affinity of individual integrin molecules with their matrix molecules . Current experimen - tal approaches such as estimation of cell spreading area or fraction of remaining adherent cells after centrifugation 35 or shearing in microfluidic devices , 36 and measurement of single - bond rupture force by atomic force microscopy 37 , 38 have severe limitations , since they do not decipher the various contributors to global cell adhe - sion , that are intertwined with each other , and may indirectly or directly influence cell - matrix adhesion . Since cell speed depends biphasically on focal adhesion size 8 and biphasically on cell adhesion , 31 focal adhesion size may correlate linearly with cell - matrix adhe - sion . The migratory speed , focal adhesion morphology , and spreading ( cell size ) of MEFs subjected to genetic manipulations and different mechanical stimuli were systematically compared ( Fig . 1A – F ) . As predicted , the extent of cell spreading increases linearly with focal adhesion size ( Fig . 1E ) ; however , cell migration and cell spreading are poorly correlated , as assessed by linear and nonlinear fits ( Fig . 1F and G ) .
