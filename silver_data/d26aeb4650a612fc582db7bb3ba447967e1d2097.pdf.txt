( 1996 ) J . Biol . Chem . 271 , 12632 – 12638 ) . To understand the mechanism of fascin - actin interactions , we dissected the actin binding region and its regulatory site by phos - phorylation of human fascin . First , we found that the C - terminal half constitutes an actin binding domain . Partial digestion of human recombinant fascin with trypsin yielded the C - terminal fragment with molecular masses of 32 , 30 , and 27 kDa . The 32 - and 27 - kDa frag - ments purified as a mixture formed a dimer and bound to F - actin at a saturation ratio of 1 dimer : 11 actin mol - ecules with an affinity of 1 . 4 (cid:51) 10 6 M (cid:50) 1 . Second , we iden - tified the phosphorylation site of fascin as Ser - 39 by sequencing a tryptic phosphopeptide purified by chelat - ing column chromatography followed by C - 18 reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography . Pep - tide map analyses revealed that the purified peptide represented the major phosphorylation site of in vivo as well as in vitro phosphorylated fascin . The mutation replacingSer - 39withAlaeliminatedthephosphorylation - dependent regulation of actin binding of fascin , indicat - ing that phosphorylation at this site regulates the actin binding ability of fascin . Bundles of actin filaments , found in many cellular struc - tures , including stress fibers , contractile rings , microvilli , and microspikes at the leading edges of motile cells , are formed mainly due to the functions of actin - bundling or cross - linking proteins . To date , a number of actin - bundling or cross - linking proteins have been characterized and demonstrated to play different roles in each of the cellular structures ( for reviews , see Refs . 1 and 2 ) . The 55 - kDa actin - bundling protein from HeLa cells has been purified as a major component of actin gels , which are formed by adding exogenous actin into cytoplasmic extracts ( 3 ) . It binds to actin in a stoichiometry of 1 : 4 and cross - links F - actin into bundles in vitro . The protein is a globular and monomeric protein ( 3 ) . Immunocytochemical study has revealed that the 55 - kDa protein is localized both in stress fibers and micro - spikes in cultured cells ( 4 ) , suggesting that this protein is involved in the formation of actin bundles in vivo . The in vitro characteristics of the HeLa 55 - kDa protein is very similar to that of sea urchin fascin . Sea urchin fascin , isolated from cytoplasmic extracts of sea urchin eggs ( 5 , 6 ) , is the first actin - bundling protein to be characterized in vitro ( 7 ) . Fascin is recruited to the cortical cytoskeleton to form mi - crovilli at fertilization of eggs ( 8 ) and filopodia of coelomocytes , phagocytic cells from the coelomic cavity ( 9 , 10 ) . Those struc - tures have actin bundle cores with an 11 - nm transverse cross - banding pattern ( 11 , 12 ) , which is also observed in actin bun - dles formed with fascin in vitro ( 7 ) . Thus , those studies have demonstrated that echinoid fascin plays crucial roles in form - ing actin bundles . Molecular cloning of sea urchin fascin by Bryan et al . ( 13 ) has revealed that fascin has sequence similarity to the Drosophila singed gene ( sn ) product ( 14 ) , whereas fascin shows no appar - ent homology with the other known actin - binding proteins . Subsequently , the HeLa 55 - kDa actin - bundling protein has been demonstrated to be a human homologue of the sn product and sea urchin fascin ( 15 , 16 ) . Therefore , we will henceforth designate the HeLa 55 - kDa actin - bundling protein as human fascin . Recently , fascin cDNAs have been cloned from Xenopus ( 17 ) and mouse ( 18 ) , indicating that fascin constitutes a widely distributed gene family . Drosophila singed mutants exhibit gnarled bristle develop - ment and female sterility ( 19 ) . In normal Drosophila bristles , 7 – 11 bundles of microfilaments are attached to the plasma membrane . However , in developing bristles of sn mutants , the number of actin bundles is greatly reduced and disorganized ( 20 , 21 ) . Cant et al . ( 22 ) have shown that the recombinant sn gene product ( Drosophila fascin ) can produce actin bundles with 12 - nm transverse cross - banding , which is also observed in the microfilament bundles in bristles . In addition , Drosophila fascin is present in normal bristles , but the absence of Drosoph - ila fascin in sn mutants correlates with the development of gnarled bristles . Female sterility of sn mutants is caused by the defects in the transfer of cytoplasm from nurse cells to the oocytes . The nurse cells of sn mutants lack cytoplasmic actin bundles , so that the nurse cell nuclei are allowed to plug up the ring canals to block cytoplasmic transfer ( 22 ) . There must be mechanisms that control fascin - actin interac - tions in a variety of biological activities . For example , actin bundles containing fascin are formed in response to cell adhe - sion to thrombospondin 1 ( 24 ) , fertilization of sea urchin eggs * This work was supported by Grant CD - 40B from the American Cancer Society and Grant R37 CA42742 from the National Institutes of Health .

This paper is available on line at http : / / www - jbc . stanford . edu / jbc / 2527 ( 8 ) , and treatment of starfish oocytes with the maturation - inducing hormone 1 - methyladenine ( 25 ) . Filopodia of fibro - blasts that contain fascin - actin bundles are known to be highly motile structures , constantly extending and retracting during cell locomotion . We have found that fascin is phosphorylated in vivo on 12 - O - tetradecanoylphorbol - 13 - acetate treatment and also in vitro by protein kinase C ( PKC ) 1 at the same sites ( 26 ) . Phosphorylation of fascin results in the reduction of its actin binding ability , suggesting that phosphorylation may be one of the mechanisms that regulate fascin - actin interactions ( 26 ) . To further understand the fascin - actin interaction and its regulation , we dissected the actin binding domain and PKC phosphorylation site of fascin . We found that at least one of the actin - binding sites was located in the C terminus , and that the major PKC phosphorylation site was in the N terminus ( Ser - 39 ) . We generated a mutant fascin replacing the phosphoryla - tion site with Ala . Actin binding of the mutant was no longer regulated by phosphorylation , indicating that phosphorylation at the N terminus regulates the fascin - actin interaction . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials— The HeLa 55 - kDa protein ( human fascin ) was prepared from HeLa cells as described ( 3 ) . Actin was prepared from rabbit skel - etal muscle as described ( 27 ) . PKC was purchased from Biomol ( Plym - outh Meeting , PA ) . [ (cid:103) - 32 P ] ATP was from Amersham Corp . Trypsin ( treated with L - tosylamido - 2 - phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone ) was from Worthington . Human thrombin was from Boehringer Mannheim . Preparation of Recombinant Human Fascin— The bacterial expres - sion vector for human fascin was constructed by cloning the Sma I fragment of human fascin cDNA ( 1 . 7 kilobases ) into pGEX - 2T to make a fusion protein with glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) ( 15 ) . E . coli strain JR600 carrying the plasmid was grown in Luria Bertani medium con - taining 50 (cid:109) g / ml ampicillin at 37 °C until the A 600 reached 0 . 6 . Protein expression was induced by adding 0 . 1 m M isopropyl (cid:98) - D - thiogalactopy - ranoside at 25 °C for 3 h . Cells were harvested by centrifugation and disrupted by sonication in phosphate - buffered saline plus 1 m M dithio - threitol ( DTT ) . The lysate was centrifuged at 10 , 000 rpm for 20 min ( Beckman Instruments JA - 20 rotor ) , and the supernatant was applied to a glutathione - Sepharose 4B column ( Pharmacia Biotech Inc . ) , which had been equilibrated with phosphate - buffered saline plus 1 m M DTT . The bound protein was eluted with 10 m M glutathione , 0 . 1 M NaCl , 50 m M Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 . The eluate was dialyzed against phosphate - buffered saline plus 1 m M DTT and digested with 1 (cid:109) g / ml thrombin at room temperature for 2 h to cleave GST from the GST - fascin fusion protein . Thrombin was inactivated by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 5 m M . Then , the digest was applied to glutathione - Sepharose 4B to adsorb GST . The flow - through fractions containing 55 - kDa recombinant fascin ( r - fascin ) were pooled and con - centrated by Centricon 10 ( Amicon ) . Separation of Fascin C - terminal Fragments— r - Fascin ( 10 mg / ml ) was digested with L - tosylamido - 2 - phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone - trypsin ( 0 . 2 mg / ml ) at 25 °C for 3 h . After trypsin was inactivated by adding 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , the digest was applied to a Mono - Q column ( Pharmacia ) , which had been equilibrated with 20 m M Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 . The column was developed with a linear NaCl gradi - ent ( 0 – 400 m M ) . Column fractions containing fascin C - terminal frag - ments were pooled , dialyzed against 20 m M Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , and applied again to the Mono - Q column . The column was developed in the same way as the first round . The fractions of the C - terminal fragments containing no intact fascin were dialyzed against 0 . 1 M KCl , 20 m M imidazole - HCl , 1 m M DTT , pH 7 . 0 , and concentrated by Centricon 10 . F - actin Binding or Bundling Assay— F - actin ( 0 . 5 or 1 . 0 mg / ml ) was incubated with varying amounts of r - fascin or r - fascin fragments in 0 . 1 M KCl , 20 m M imidazole - HCl , 0 . 2 m M DTT , pH 7 . 0 , for 1 h at room temperature . For the F - actin binding assay , the mixtures were centri - fuged in a Beckman Airfuge at 26 p . s . i . for 20 min . For the actin bundling assay , they were centrifuged in an Eppendorf Microfuge at 12 , 000 (cid:51) g for 10 min . Both supernatants and pellets were analyzed by SDS - PAGE , followed by densitometry . Purification of the Phosphopeptide Derived from Fascin— Human fascin ( 150 (cid:109) g at 0 . 3 mg / ml ) prepared from HeLa cells was phosphoryl - ated with 0 . 7 (cid:109) g / ml PKC for 1 h at 30 °C in the buffer containing 30 m M KCl , 5 m M MgCl 2 , 1 m M EGTA , 10 m M MES - KOH , pH 5 . 5 , 100 ng / ml 12 - O - tetradecanoylphorbol - 13 - acetate , 150 (cid:109) g / ml phosphatidylserine , and 0 . 5 m M ATP ( 0 . 125 mCi / ml [ (cid:103) - 32 P ] ATP ) . The reaction was stopped by adding 0 . 25 volume of 5 (cid:51) SDS sample buffer ( 5 % SDS , 37 . 5 % glycerol , 0 . 25 M DTT , 25 (cid:109) g / ml bromphenol blue , 0 . 2 M Tris - HCl , pH 6 . 8 ) , followed by heat treatment at 100 °C for 2 min . Then , phosphoryl - ated fascin was purified by preparative SDS - PAGE , followed by elec - troelution . The eluted protein was precipitated by adding 3 volume of cold acetone ( (cid:50) 20 °C ) . The air - dried protein was dissolved in 0 . 1 M Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 containing 8 M urea , reduced with 5 m M DTT for 5 h at room temperature , and then carboxamido - methylated with 10 m M io - doacetoamide for 20 min at room temperature . The protein was precip - itated with 6 volume of acetone ( room temperature ) , dried , and solubi - lized in 0 . 1 M Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , containing 8 M urea . The dissolved protein ( 150 (cid:109) l ) was diluted with 0 . 1 M Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) containing 1 m M DTT to reduce the urea concentration to 2 M , and then digested with 25 (cid:109) g / ml of trypsin ( L - tosylamido - 2 - phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone - treated ; Worthington ) for 24 h at 37 °C . Then , the digest was adjusted to pH 4 . 0 with acetic acid and loaded to a iminodiacetic acid - Sepharose 6B column ( 0 . 7 ml in a 1 - ml syringe ) , which had been charged with Fe 3 (cid:49) ( 28 ) . The column was washed with 0 . 1 M acetic acid , and the bound peptides were eluted sequentially with 0 . 1 M sodium acetate , pH 5 . 0 , 1 % ammonium acetate , pH 6 . 1 , 1 % ammonium acetate , pH 8 . 3 , and 0 . 2 M EDTA , pH 8 . 0 . The eluate at pH 6 . 1 , which contained most of the radioactivity ( Fig . 5 ) , was lyophilized , dissolved in 0 . 06 % trifluoroacetic acid , and applied to a C - 18 reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography column ( Delta - Pak C18 , 300 Å , 2 (cid:51) 150 mm ; Millipore Waters ) , which had been equilibrated with eluent A ( 0 . 06 % trifluoro - acetic acid ) . The column was developed with a linear gradient of 0 – 100 % eluent B ( 80 % acetonitrile , 0 . 052 % trifluoroacetic acid ) over 105 min at 0 . 2 ml / min . Absorbance data were processed and analyzed with Millennium 2010 ( Millipore Waters ) . The radioactivity was counted in the Cerenkov manner . Site - directed Mutagenesis of Human Fascin— The Sma I fragment of human fascin cDNA ( 1 . 7 kilobases ) was cloned into pTZ18U and then used for oligonucleotide - directed in vitro mutagenesis using a Muta - Gene phagemid in vitro mutagenesis kit ( Bio - Rad ) . An oligonucleotide , 5 (cid:57) - GAACGCGTCCGCCAGCGCCCTGAAGAAGAAGCAG - 3 (cid:57) , was used as a primer to mutate Ser - 39 to Ala . The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing . The mutated insert was subcloned into a pGEX - 2T vector and used for protein expression . The mutant fascin was ex - pressed and purified as described above for wild - type r - fascin . Other Procedures— - Two - dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide map - ping was performed as described ( 34 ) . Protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay reagent ( Pierce ) using bovine serum albumin as a standard . SDS - PAGE was performed by the method of Blatter et al . ( 29 ) with 12 . 5 % polyacrylamide slab gels , except that the buffer system of Laemmli ( 30 ) was used . Microsequencing of fascin C - terminal fragments and the purified phosphopeptide was as de - scribed ( 16 ) . For electron microscopy , one drop of sample solution was put onto a carbon - coated Formvar grid and negatively stained with 1 % uranyl acetate . Samples were observed by JEOL 100CX II at an accel - erating voltage of 80 kV . RESULTS Production and Characterization of Recombinant Fas - cin— We have modified a method using bacterial expression of r - fascin to obtain active protein . In a previous attempt to pro - duce r - fascin as a fusion protein with GST , no soluble protein was recovered ( 15 ) . However , we found that the GST - fascin fusion protein was expressed as a soluble protein in the same system when the expression was induced at a low temperature ( 25 °C ) . Then , r - fascin was successfully purified by glutathione affinity column chromatography , followed by cleavage of the GST portion with thrombin ( Fig . 1 ) . Although r - fascin has an extra peptide ( GSPGPRSGLSSTAT ) at the N terminus , which was derived from the 5 (cid:57) - untranslated region , r - fascin showed an actin bundling activity similar to that of authentic fascin purified from HeLa cells . As Fig . 2 shows , when purified r - fascin was incubated with F - actin , F - actin became pelletable in low speed centrifugation ( Fig . 2 A ) , and bundles of F - actin were 1 The abbreviations used are : PKC , protein kinase C ; GST , glutathi - one S - transferase ; DTT , dithiothreitol ; r - fascin , recombinant fascin ; PAGE , polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ; MES , 2 - ( N - morpholino ) eth - anesulfonic acid ; MARCKS , myristoylated alanine - rich C - kinase substrate . Actin Binding and Phosphorylation Sites of Fascin 2528 observed by electron microscopy ( Fig . 2 B ) . It should be noted that the GST - fascin fusion protein also showed similar actin - bundling activity , indicating that the addition of extra se - quences to the N terminus does not seem to affect the actin - bundling activity of fascin . The C - terminal Tryptic Fragments of r - Fascin Bind to F - actin— Previous studies ( 3 ) have shown that fascin is a globular and monomeric actin - bundling protein , suggesting that it has at least two actin binding sites in a single molecule . To define the actin binding sites of fascin , we first constructed several N - or C - terminal deleted forms of fascin in a bacterial expression system to test whether those truncated forms bind to actin . However , all efforts to produce truncated proteins with binding activity have failed , despite our success in producing fully active , full - length fascin in bacteria . Even a small truncation ( less than 20 amino acids ) at either the N or C terminus resulted in the complete loss of actin binding activity . Because such negative results are fruitless , we applied a classic prote - olysis method for the dissection of the fascin domain structure . Partial digestion of r - fascin with trypsin yielded three frag - ments with M r values of 27 , 000 , 30 , 000 , and 32 , 000 , ( Fig . 3 A ) . The same fragments were observed by digesting authentic HeLa fascin with trypsin ( data not shown ) , suggesting that r - fascin has the same conformation as authentic HeLa fascin . The N terminus sequencing of these fragments showed that all three fragments were derived from the C terminus of fascin ; both 32 - and 30 - kDa fragments started from residue 248 , and the 27 - kDa fragment started from residue 277 ( Fig . 3 B ) . These results indicate that they constitute approximately the C - ter - minal half of the molecule , and it is noted that the 30 - kDa fragment appears to lack a small portion of the C terminus . The N - terminal fragments appear to be digested quickly , because no N - terminal fragments were obtained by trypsin digestion . We found that all three tryptic C - terminal fragments copre - cipitated with F - actin together with undigested r - fascin when the trypsin digests were incubated with F - actin . This observa - tion suggests that the C terminus had at least one actin binding site . The actin binding of 30 - kDa fragments suggests that the very end of the C terminus may not be required for actin binding . To exclude the possibility that the coprecipitation of the C - terminal fragments with F - actin is due to complex for - mation between the fragments and undigested fascin , we sep - arated the C - terminal fragments from undigested fascin and examined their actin binding abilities . Both 32 - and 27 - kDa fragments were purified as a 1 : 1 ( molar ratio ) mixture , whereas the 30 - kDa fragment was lost apparently due to digestion during purification , as no band of 30 kDa was detected by SDS - PAGE in any fractions . An actin binding assay revealed that both 32 - and 27 - kDa fragments bound to F - actin in the absence of undigested fascin ( Fig . 4 A ) . The mixture of the 32 - and 27 - kDa C - terminal frag - ments also showed actin bundling activity . The fragments ap - peared , however , to exist as a dimer , as judged from gel filtra - tion chromatography , and therefore , we could not conclude whether the fragments had one or two actin binding sites , F IG . 1 . Purification of recombinant human fascin . Lysates of bacteria expressing GST - fascin ( lane a ) were applied to a glutathione - Sepharose 4B column . GST - fascin eluted from the glutathione - Sepha - rose 4B column ( lane b ) was digested with thrombin ( lane c ) . r - Fascin ( arrowhead F ) was purified by the adsorption of cleaved GST to the same glutathione - Sepharose 4B column ( lane d ) . Molecular mass mark - ers in kDa are indicated on the left . F IG . 2 . F - actin bundling activity of r - fascin . A , F - Actin ( 0 . 5 mg / ml ) was incubated without ( (cid:50) ) or with ( (cid:49) ) r - fascin ( 0 . 1 mg / ml ) for 1 h at room temperature . The mixtures were centrifuged for 10 min at 12 , 000 (cid:51) g ( Eppendorf Microfuge ) . Supernatants ( s ) and pellets ( p ) were analyzed by SDS - PAGE . In the presence of r - fascin , F - actin formed bundles and became pelletable . Molecular mass markers in kDa are indicated on the right . B , Electron micrograph of actin bundles formed with r - fascin ( 0 . 2 mg / ml ) and F - actin ( 0 . 5 mg / ml ) . Bar , 0 . 2 (cid:109) m . Actin Binding and Phosphorylation Sites of Fascin 2529 although further digestion yields no smaller fragments that retained actin binding ability . These results indicate that the C - terminal half of fascin has at least one actin binding domain . The stoichiometry of actin binding was determined by vary - ing concentrations of purified fragments . Because both 32 - and 27 - kDa fragments bound to F - actin indistinguishably , these two fragments were treated as the same molecule and as a dimer with a M r of 59 , 000 . As Fig . 4 B shows , actin binding of the C - terminal fragments was saturated at a molar ratio of 1 dimer : 11 actin molecules , and the apparent binding constant was estimated to be 1 . 4 (cid:51) 10 6 M (cid:50) 1 , which is 2 . 5 times lower than that of intact r - fascin ( see Fig . 9 ) . We also used other proteolytic enzymes , including Lys - C , V8 protease , and chymotrypsin , to yield fragments containing dif - ferent domains with partial actin binding ability . Although such digestion yielded different proteolytic patterns , the pro - teolytic fragments did not show significant actin binding ability . Identification of the PKC Phosphorylation Site of Fascin— We have previously shown that ( 1 ) fascin is phosphorylated in vivo on 12 - O - tetradecanoylphorbol - 13 - acetate treatment ; ( 2 ) the same sites are phosphorylated in vitro by PKC ; and ( 3 ) PKC phosphorylation inhibits actin binding of human fascin ( 26 ) . The sites of PKC phosphorylation appeared to be within the N terminus of fascin , because the C - terminal actin binding frag - ment did not contain 32 P radioactivity when phosphorylated fascin was digested by trypsin as described above . To determine the phosphorylation sites , we purified phos - phopeptides following complete digestion of PKC - phosphoryl - ated fascin and found , by microsequencing of purified phos - F IG . 3 . Partial digestion of r - fascin by trypsin yielded the C - terminal fragments . A , r - fascin ( 0 . 5 mg / ml ) was incubated with tryp - sin ( 0 . 05 mg / ml ) for 3 ( a ) , 7 ( b ) , 22 ( c ) , or 48 ( d ) h , and the aliquots were analyzed by SDS - PAGE . Molecular mass markers in kDa are indicated on the left . B , N - Terminal peptide sequences of fragments 1 – 3 are shown . Fragments 1 and 2 started from residue 248 , and fragment 3 started from residue 277 . These sequences and molecular masses of the fragments ( 27 – 32 kDa ) show that fragments 1 – 3 constitute nearly the C - terminal half of r - fascin . Fragment 2 may lack a small portion of the C terminus . F IG . 4 . The C - terminal fragments of r - fascin bind to F - actin . r - fascin was digested with trypsin at 25 °C for 3 h . The C - terminal fragments were purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” and used for the F - actin binding assay . A , the C - terminal fragments were incubated with ( (cid:49) ) or without ( (cid:50) ) F - actin ( 0 . 5 mg / ml ) . Superna - tants ( s ) and pellets ( p ) were analyzed by SDS - PAGE . The C - terminal fragments cosedimented with F - actin . Molecular mass markers in kDa are indicated on the right . B , the actin binding assay was performed at varying concentrations of the C - terminal fragments , and the amounts of bound fragments were plotted . The fragments were treated as a dimer with a M r of 59 , 000 . The binding of the dimer fragments to F - actin was saturated at the molar ratio of 1 : 11 . F IG . 5 . Separation of fascin phosphopeptides by chelating col - umn chromatography . PKC - phosphorylated fascin was digested with trypsin as described under “Experimental Procedures . ” The digest was applied to an iron - iminodiacetic acid - Sepharose column and eluted by a stepwise pH gradient . The percentages of radioactivities in the eluates are shown . Actin Binding and Phosphorylation Sites of Fascin 2530 phopeptides , that Ser - 39 is the site of phosphorylation by PKC . The chelating column chromatography ( Fe 3 (cid:49) - charged iminodi - acetic acid - Sepharose 6B ) was used to adsorb phosphopeptides selectively ( 31 ) . The bound peptides were eluted by a stepwise pH gradient . In the case of PKC - phosphorylated fascin , most of the phosphopeptides were eluted at pH 6 . 1 ( Fig . 5 ) . This does not seems to be a typical elution pattern for phosphopeptides , since previous reports have shown that phosphopeptides are eluted at more basic pH , around pH 9 . 0 ( 31 , 32 ) . The eluate at pH 6 . 1 was separated by C - 18 reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography ( Fig . 6 ) . The peak ( Fig . 6 , arrowhead ) matched with the peak of radioactivity and was pure enough to be sequenced , as judged from the chromatogram and spectrum . As a result of microsequencing of peak a , the peptide was found to correspond to residue 33 – 42 of the fascin sequence ( Fig . 6 b ) . The recovery of serine residue 39 was poor , which is character - istic of phosphoserine after Edman degradation . Phosphopeptide map analyses were performed to determine whether the purified phosphopeptide represents the major phosphorylation site of fascin . A peptide map of the purified peptide ( Fig . 7 A ) gave two spots , a and b , probably because one was generated during peptide mapping by digestion of the other at one of lysine residue of its C terminus . The pattern of the purified peptide was similar to that of authentic fascin phosphorylated in vitro by PKC ( Fig . 7 C ) . This is confirmed because the two spots , a and b , exactly comigrated with the two major spots of fascin phosphorylated in vitro by PKC ( Fig . 7 B ) . We have previously shown that both in vivo and in vitro phos - phorylation of fascin occur at the same site ( 26 ) . These results thus indicate that Ser - 39 is the major site of in vitro as well as in vivo phosphorylation . Characterization of a Fascin Mutant Lacking the PKC Phos - phorylation Site— To verify the importance of the phosphoryl - ation site in regulating the actin binding ability of fascin , we produced and characterized a fascin mutant lacking the PKC phosphorylation site of Ser - 39 . Using site - directed mutagene - sis , Ser - 39 was replaced with Ala . The resultant mutant fascin ( called A - fascin ) was bacterially expressed and purified ( see “Experimental Procedures” ) . We found that PKC phosphoryl - ated A - fascin to an extent 10 times lower ( 0 . 03 mol P i / mol of protein ) than wild - type r - fascin ( 0 . 3 mol P i / mol of protein ) . A phosphopeptide map of PKC - phosphorylated A - fascin exhibited one minor spot , which was specific to the r - fascin ( Fig . 8 B , arrowhead ; this spot is likely to be produced by the phospho - rylation of the extra peptide at the N terminus of r - fascin derived from the 5 (cid:57) - untranslated region ) . On the other hand , F IG . 6 . Identification of the PKC phosphorylation site of fas - cin . The eluate at pH 6 . 1 from the chelating column chromatography ( Fig . 5 ) was separated by C - 18 reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography using an 0 – 80 % acetonitrile gradient . The chromato - gram was monitored at 210 nm ( a ) , and the radioactivities of the fractions ( b ) are shown . The most radioactive fraction ( arrowhead ) was subjected to microsequencing and found to contain the phosphopeptide with the sequence shown . (cid:112) , posistion of the phosphorylated serine . F IG . 7 . The purified phosphopeptide represents the major spots in the peptide maps generated by in vitro phosphorylation of fascin with PKC . Phosphopeptide mapping of the purified phos - phopeptide was performed as described under “Experimental Proce - dures . ” A , the phosphopeptide alone ; B , a mixture of the phosphopeptide and in vitro phosphorylated fascin ; and C , in vitro phosphorylated fascin alone . The two phosphopeptide spots ( a and b ) generated by the purified peptide matched with the two major spots generated by in vitro phosphorylation . The same spots are also observed in the map of in vivo phosphorylated fascin on 12 - O - tetradecanoylphorbol - 13 - acetate treat - ment . Two minor spots , c and d , are probably products of incomplete digestion , because they were not reproducibly observed . Actin Binding and Phosphorylation Sites of Fascin 2531 the wild - type r - fascin showed the same pattern as that of authentic fascin except for the presence of the additional spot specific to the recombinant fascin ( Fig . 8 A , arrowhead ) . These results confirm that Ser - 39 was the major phosphorylation site of fascin . We analyzed the effect of PKC phosphorylation on actin binding activities of A - fascin and wild - type r - fascin . As Fig . 9 shows , actin binding of r - fascin was regulated by phosphoryl - ation with PKC in a way similar to the way authentic fascin is regulated ( 26 ) . The apparent association constant was esti - mated to be 3 . 5 (cid:51) 10 6 M (cid:50) 1 for r - fascin , which is approximately two times lower than that ( 6 . 7 (cid:51) 10 6 M (cid:50) 1 ) of authentic fascin . The reason for this decrease is currently unknown . It may be due to the presence of the extra N - terminal sequence in r - fascin . Phosphorylation of r - fascin by PKC ( phosphate incorpo - ration , 0 . 3 mol P i / mol of protein ) reduced its apparent actin binding constant to less than 0 . 5 (cid:51) 10 5 M (cid:50) 1 . In contrast , the actin binding of A - fascin was not regulated by PKC phospho - rylation . The actin binding of A - fascin was the same as that of unphosphorylated r - fascin regardless of the treatment of A - fascin with PKC , indicating that Ser - 39 is responsible for the phosphorylation - dependent regulation of fascin - actin binding . DISCUSSION Our results indicate that actin binding of human fascin is regulated by phosphorylation at the N terminus . The major phosphorylation site , Ser - 39 , has a PKC consensus motif , ( S / T ) X ( K / R ) ( 35 ) , which is present in all fascins , including mouse , Drosophila , Xenopus , and sea urchin fascins ( 23 ) . It should also be noted that the site is located in one of the most conserved regions among all fascins , and in particular , the sequences surrounding this site are virtually identical among human , mouse , and Xenopus fascins , suggesting that phosphorylation may universally control actin binding of all vertebrate fascins . The sequence surrounding the phosphorylation site may con - stitute an actin binding site in the N terminus . Ser - 39 is lo - cated in a 15 - amino acid sequence of fascin ( residue 29 – 42 , FGFKVNASASSLKKK ) which , as pointed out by Mosialos et al . ( 16 ) , shows similarity to the actin binding site of myristoy - lated alanine - rich C - kinase substrate ( MARCKS ) ( the residue 151 – 166 , FSFKKSFKLSGFSFKK ) ( 36 , 40 ) . The actin binding site of MARCKS contains three PKC phosphorylation sites ( 37 , 38 ) , and importantly , phosphorylation by PKC at these sites inhibits the binding of MARCKS to actin in a way similar to the phosphorylation - dependent regulation of fascin - actin interac - tions . Furthermore , the cluster of basic amino acids have been identified to be responsible for actin binding of several actin - binding proteins ( for review , see Ref . 39 ) . In the case of fascin , the phosphorylation site is followed by three lysine residues . If this stretch of basic amino acids constitutes the actin binding site , phosphorylation will give negative charges , and the inhi - bition of actin binding through phosphorylation is neatly explained . Fascin is a globular protein , and correct folding is important for its actin binding . It is thus quite possible that phosphoryl - ation at the N terminus not only directly inhibits binding of the putative N - terminal actin binding site but also affects the actin binding of the C terminus . This notion is supported by the result that the actin binding constant of phosphorylated r - fascin was considerably lower than that of the purified C ter - F IG . 8 . The mutation at Ser - 39 causes loss of the major spots in the phosphopeptide map . Ser - 39 of human fascin was mutated to Ala by site - directed mutagenesis . The wild - type ( A ) and mutant ( B ) fascins were bacterially expressed and purified as GST fusion proteins , Those were phosphorylated in vitro by PKC and analyzed by two - dimensional peptide mapping . Note that the mutant lost the two major spots in its peptide map ( B ) . Arrowhead , phosphopeptide spot specific for r - fascin . F IG . 9 . Effects of PKC phosphorylation on actin binding of the fascin mutant lacking Ser - 39 . Wild - type and mutant fascins were phosphorylated by PKC and assayed for actin binding . As a control , wild - type and mutant fascins were incubated under the same phospho - rylation conditions , except that PKC was not added . Note that actin binding of the mutant fascin was similar to that of wild - type fascin , and PKC phosphorylation did not affect actin binding of the mutant . Actin Binding and Phosphorylation Sites of Fascin 2532 minus . Furthermore , we observed that trypsin digested phos - phorylated fascin much more rapidly than the nonphos - phorylated form ( data not shown ) , suggesting that phosphoryl - ation induces a conformational change . Fascin should have two actin binding domains in a single molecule ( 3 ) . The purified C - terminal fragments were able to bind to actin and to make the F - actin aggregate into bundles . This observation , however , does not lead to the conclusion that the C terminus has two actin binding domains , because the C - terminal fragments formed dimers . Rather , we think it likely that the N and C termini each have one actin binding site from the following reasons . First , as described above , the N terminus has a sequence that shows similarity to the actin binding site of MARCKS . Second , the actin binding affinity of the C terminus was two to three times lower than that of intact r - fascin , suggesting that the N terminus may be involved in the binding of intact fascin to actin . Last , Edwards et al . ( 33 ) have recently made a similar approach using proteolysis of recombinant mu - rine fascin , in which the 30 - kDa C - terminal fragment binds to but does not bundle F - actin . Proper folding is essential for fascin to show its actin binding ability . Full - length fascin with actin binding ability can be produced in bacteria at a low culture temperature of 25 °C but not at 37 °C . At 37 °C virtually all fascins became insoluble , indicating that expressed fascin had adopted an incorrect con - formation . Furthermore , bacterially expressed fascin trun - cates , which lack less than 20 amino acids of its N or C termi - nus , did not bind to actin , even though they were expressed as soluble proteins at a lower culture temperature . In addition , although the C terminus produced by proteolysis of intact r - fascin binds to actin , the same C - terminal fragment , when bacterially expressed , shows no actin binding ability , confirm - ing that bacterially produced fascin truncates do not fold correctly . A possible next step for the structural analyses is the iden - tification of residues critical for actin binding through the ex - pression of mutants with charged residues replaced with polar residues . Such studies must be carefully interpreted , however , because we currently have no basis to judge whether such mutants are conformationally altered . We are collaborating with Dr . S . Almo ( Albert Einstein University ) to obtain three - dimensional structural information through crystallography . We have successfully prepared excellent crystals of bacterially expressed full - length fascin , which diffracts to 3 . 0 Å . A heavy atom search is now in progress . We speculate that one of the actin binding domains is located in the C terminus , and the other is possibly in the N terminus . Phosphorylation at the N terminus by PKC is likely to inhibit both actin binding sites . We have generated an A - fascin mu - tant , the actin binding of which is not regulated by phospho - rylation . To verify the physiological significance of phosphoryl - ation at Ser - 39 , we plan to examine , through transfection , what effects this unphosphorylatable mutant will have on the orga - nization of the microfilament cytoskeleton , in particular , mo - tility of fascin - containing filopodia .
