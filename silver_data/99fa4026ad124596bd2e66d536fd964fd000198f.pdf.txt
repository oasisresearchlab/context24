However , data on the viral loads in such individuals are lacking . We assessed the viral loads in asymptomatic individuals with SARS - CoV - 2 infection in comparison with those in symptomatic patients with COVID - 19 . Methods Study participants were recruited from a community facility designated for the isolation of patients with mild COVID - 19 in South Korea . The presence of symptoms was evaluated with a questionnaire - based survey . Viral loads in the upper respiratory tract were measured with real - time reverse transcription - PCR ( RT - PCR ) targeting the E , RdRp and N genes of SARS - CoV - 2 , with a cycle threshold ( Ct ) value of 40 for determining positivity . Results In 213 patients with SARS - CoV - 2 infection , 41 ( 19 % ) had remained asymptomatic from potential exposure to laboratory confirmation and admission ; of them , 39 ( 95 % ) underwent follow - up RT - PCR testing after a median 13 days . In 172 symptomatic patients , 144 ( 84 % ) underwent follow - up RT - PCR testing . Twenty - one ( 54 % ) asymptomatic individuals and 92 ( 64 % ) symptomatic patients tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 at follow - up . Asymptomatic individuals and symptomatic patients did not show any significant differences in the mean Ct values of the E ( 31 . 15 vs 31 . 43 ; p > 0 . 99 ) , RdRp ( 32 . 26 vs 32 . 93 ; p = 0 . 92 ) and N ( 33 . 05 vs 33 . 28 ; p > 0 . 99 ) genes . Conclusion Approximately one - fifth of the individuals without severe symptoms were asymptomatic , and their viral loads were comparable to those in symptomatic patients . A large proportion of mildly symptomatic patients with COVID - 19 or asymptomatic individuals with SARS - CoV - 2 showed persistent positive upper respiratory RT - PCR results at follow - up . INTRODUCTION The presence of asymptomatic individuals with positive reverse transcription - PCR ( RT - PCR ) results for SARS - CoV - 2 has been noted even in the early reports of the COVID - 19 outbreak . 1 2 Moreover , several case reports have suggested that the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 from asymptom - atic individuals is possible . 1 – 3 However , owing to the rapid spread of COVID - 19 and the resulting shortage in PCR testing capabilities , asymptomatic individuals with SARS - CoV - 2 infection are likely to go unnoticed by healthcare workers . There - fore , asymptomatic individuals have not been systematically evaluated in terms of their viral load and infectivity , and thus , the extent of their possible contribution to the community spread of COVID - 19 is unknown . In South Korea , a large cluster of COVID - 19 cases was identified in Daegu City ; this cluster was soon revealed to be related to a single religious group . 4 Thereafter , Korean epidemiologic teams thoroughly traced the close contacts of this religious group and discovered more than 3000 cases of COVID - 19 with a wide range of symptom severity , from none to severe . Those without severe symp - toms were admitted to dedicated care facilities for isolation and monitoring . As a result of this unique situation , we were able to assess many asymptom - atic individuals who were otherwise unlikely to be identified as cases of COVID - 19 . Here , we assessed the viral load in the upper respiratory tract of asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS - CoV - 2 using the cycle threshold ( Ct ) values of RT - PCR targeting SARS - CoV - 2 genes Key questions What is the key question ? ► Do asymptomatic individuals with SARS - CoV - 2 infection have the potential to significantly contribute to the community spread of COVID - 19 ? What is the bottom line ? ► In a series of 213 patients with COVID - 19 without severe symptoms , 19 % were asymptomatic from potential exposure to laboratory confirmation and admission . Asymptomatic individuals had comparable loads of SARS - CoV - 2 genes to symptomatic patients . Why read on ? ► Asymptomatic individuals were frequent among those infected with SARS - CoV - 2 , but harboured a comparable viral load compared with that of symptomatic patients and may thus act as a meaningful driving force for the community spread of COVID - 19 . 1 Ra SH , et al .

METHODS Study participants We recruited study participants from a community care facility designated for patients with COVID - 19 without severe symp - toms . The admission criteria were as follows : COVID - 19 national early warning score < 4 ; without high - risk profiles such as age ≥65 years , chronic illness , current smoker and those requiring supplemental oxygen due to low oxygen saturation < 90 % . This facility is located approximately 50 miles from Daegu City and housed a total of 260 patients at the time of this study . In March 2020 , we conducted a survey on the patients to gather information on any COVID - 19 symptom as well as age , sex and underlying disease . Asymptomatic individuals were defined as those who did not report any of the following symptoms : fever ( > 37 . 5°C ) , chills , myalgia , fatigue , rhinorrhea , nasal congestion , hyposmia , hypogeusia , sore throat , dyspnoea , cough , sputum production , haemoptysis , headache , dizziness , anorexia , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain and diarrhoea . Patients participated in this study by filling out the survey , and written informed consent was obtained from each patient . Missing data were obtained with telephone interviews by trained physicians . This study was approved by the institutional review board of Asan Medical Center . Sample acquisition All sample acquisitions for follow - up RT - PCR at the care centre were carried out by experienced physicians donning the complete personal protective equipment . According to the Center for Disease Control guidelines 5 for obtaining clinical specimens for confirming COVID - 19 , we obtained swab samples from both the nasopharynx and oropharynx and combined them in a single tube to maximise the sensitivity of the RT - PCR test and minimise the use of resources . The nasopharyngeal samples were obtained according to a previously reported method , 6 in which swabs were inserted through the nostril to a distance equivalent to the outer opening of the ear canal and gently rubbed for several seconds to absorb the secretions . For oropharyngeal samples , the tonsillar pillars were swabbed . The nasopharynx and oropharynx were swabbed once each with separate swabs , placed in a single tube containing 300 µ L of viral transport medium and transported to a reference laboratory under cold conditions for subsequent RNA extraction and RT - PCR testing . RT - PCR for SARS - CoV - 2 genes Viral RNA from the upper respiratory tract swab samples was extracted using the MagNA Pure 96 System ( Roche Diagnostics , Mannheim , Germany ) , according to the manufacturer’s instruc - tions . The resulting samples were tested for the E , RdRp and N genes of SARS - CoV - 2 with real - time RT - PCR using theAllplex 2019 - nCoV Assay kit ( Seegene ) 7 with CFX96 Real - Time PCR Detection System ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , California , USA ) under the following condition : 20 min at 50°C for reverse transcription and 15 min at 95°C for denaturation as the initial step , followed by 45 cycles of 15 s each at 94°C and 30 s at 58°C . A Ct value of < 40 was used as the cut - off for determining positivity , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Statistical analysis Categorical variables were compared using the Fisher’s exact test or χ 2 test as appropriate , and continuous variables were compared using the Mann - Whitney U test or Student’s t - test as appropriate . All tests of significance were two - tailed , and p values < 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant . Contin - uous variables are represented as median values with IQR for non - normally distributed variables and as mean±SD values for normally distributed variables . All statistical analyses were carried out in IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows , V . 23 . 0 ( IBM Corp . , Armonk , New York , USA ) . RESULTS Of the 260 patients with COVID - 19 , 213 ( 82 % ) participated in this study . During the observation period , 41 ( 19 % ; 95 % CI 15 % to 25 % ) individuals remained asymptomatic , of whom 39 ( 95 % ) underwent follow - up RT - PCR testing at the care facility . Of the 172 ( 81 % ; 95 % CI 75 % to 86 % ) patients with mild symptoms of COVID - 19 , 144 ( 94 % ) underwent follow - up RT - PCR testing . Thus , a total of 183 patients ( asymptomatic , n = 39 ; symptom - atic , n = 144 ) with follow - up RT - PCR results were included in the analysis . The baseline clinical characteristics of asymptomatic individ - uals and symptomatic patients are shown in table 1 . On follow - up RT - PCR testing , 21 ( 54 % ) asymptomatic individuals and 92 ( 64 % ) symptomatic patients tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 genes ( p = 0 . 25 ) . The mean Ct values of the SARS - CoV - 2 genes in asymptomatic individuals and symptomatic patients were as Table 1 Characteristics of asymptomatic individuals with SARS - CoV - 2 infection and symptomatic patients with COVID - 19 * Asymptomatic individuals ( n = 39 ) Symptomatic patients ( n = 144 ) P value Age , median ( IQR ) , y 25 . 0 ( 21 . 5 – 34 . 0 ) 26 . 5 ( 22 . 0 – 46 . 0 ) 0 . 22 Male sex , n ( % ) 22 ( 56 ) 62 ( 43 ) 0 . 14 Underlying diseases , n ( % ) 3 ( 8 ) 26 ( 18 ) 0 . 12 Hypertension 0 5 Asthma 0 4 Liver disease 0 2 COPD 0 1 Solid cancer 0 1 Rheumatologic disease 1 0 Other 2† 13‡ Interval from the first swab for diagnosis to the start of isolation , median ( IQR ) , days 6 . 0 ( 4 . 5 – 7 . 0 ) 6 . 0 ( 4 . 0 – 9 . 0 ) 0 . 84 Interval from initial confirmation to follow - up RT - PCR testing , median ( IQR ) , days 12 ( 9 – 14 ) 13 ( 11 – 15 ) 0 . 06 Interval from symptom onset to follow - up RT - PCR testing , median ( IQR ) , days NA 26±6 NA Positive result on follow - up RT - PCR testing , n ( % ) 21 ( 54 ) 92 ( 64 ) 0 . 25 Ct values , mean±SD E gene 31 . 15±2 . 72 31 . 43±2 . 80 > 0 . 99 RdRp gene 32 . 26±2 . 86 32 . 93±2 . 87 0 . 92 N gene 33 . 05±2 . 52 33 . 28±2 . 48 > 0 . 99 * Categorical variables were compared using the Fisher’s exact test or χ 2 test , as appropriate , and continuous variables were compared using the Mann - Whitney U test or Student’s t - test .

DISCUSSION A recent study on 72 314 Chinese patients reported that the proportion of asymptomatic individuals with SARS - CoV - 2 was approximately 1 % . 8 However , this study was based on patients from the Hubei Province , where the sudden shortage of health - care resources is presumed to have led to a selection bias towards the exclusion of asymptomatic individuals and patients with mild symptoms . Therefore , the actual prevalence of asymptomatic cases of COVID - 19 is most likely higher than 1 % . Accordingly , we found that 19 % of patients with COVID - 19 had remained asymptomatic from potential exposure to laboratory confirma - tion and facility admission . In our study , 54 % of asymptomatic individuals and 64 % of patients with mild symptoms showed positive results in the follow - up PCR testing conducted at a median of 13 days from diagnosis . Similarly , Xiao et al reported that in 301 patients with mild - to - moderate symptoms of COVID - 19 , the median dura - tion from symptom onset to an effective negative SARS - CoV - 2 result was 20 days . 9 A recent Chinese study also reported that the median duration of viral shedding assessed by SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR was 21 days in patients with mild COVID - 19 . 10 These results suggest that patients with COVID - 19 may experience a more protracted course than that initially hypothesised . However , our results should be interpreted with caution because positive RT - PCR results do not necessarily indicate the presence of viable virus , for which cell culture is needed for confirma - tion . Indeed , recent studies have shown that viable virus was isolated within 10 days from the symptom onset . 11 12 Therefore , further studies are needed to determine whether the prolonged duration of positive RT - PCR results in asymptomatic individuals with SARS - CoV - 2 infection or mildly symptomatic patients with COVID - 19 can be translated into a continuous need for precau - tion and quarantine . Previous studies have shown that viable SARS - CoV - 2 was isolated from asymptomatic individuals and that a certain number of cases are likely to have been transmitted from asymptomatic individuals . 12 – 15 Indeed , we found that asymp - tomatic individuals had RT - PCR Ct values for SARS - CoV - 2 genes comparable with those of patients with mild symptoms of COVID - 19 . Considering that most asymptomatic individ - uals with COVID - 19 are likely to go unnoticed by healthcare workers and continue to reside within communities , such indi - viduals may act as an essential driving force for the commu - nity spread of COVID - 19 and the ongoing pandemic state . Our data thus support the general public use of face masks as well as broadening the scope of SARS - CoV - 2 testing to include asymptomatic persons in certain high - risk settings until such time as further data become available regarding the duration and transmissibility of viable virus shedding from asymptom - atic individuals with SARS - CoV - 2 infection to support these recommendations . This study is limited in that the study population largely comprised those in their 20s and 30s , a characteristic that is likely linked to the demographic of the Shincheonji religious group . Therefore , the prevalence of asymptomatic individ - uals and their viral load may be different in other age groups . Moreover , there is a possibility of recall bias concerning the self - reports of symptoms ; nevertheless , as the study partici - pants were highly cooperative and well educated on the gravity of the current pandemic , we believe that such bias is not likely to have significantly affected our main results . Additionally , we could not obtain the results of the initial RT - PCR tests of the patients because each of them underwent RT - PCR tests at separate triages . Finally , the duration from the initial confir - mation to follow - up RT - PCR testing for symptomatic patients was slightly longer than that for asymptomatic individuals ; such a discrepancy occurred because the guideline of the community care facility recommended conducting follow - up RT - PCRs for patients after symptom resolution and at least 7 days after diagnosis . However , this bias is not likely to have substantially affected our main findings on the Ct values in the follow - up RT - PCR testing . In conclusion , we report that as many as one - fifth of indi - viduals with SARS - CoV - 2 infection without severe symptoms were asymptomatic and the viral load in their nasopharynx was comparable to that in patients with mild symptoms . In addition , a large proportion of mildly symptomatic patients or asymptomatic individuals showed persistent positive upper respiratory RT - PCR results at follow - up . Asymptomatic indi - viduals with SARS - CoV - 2 infection may contribute to the ongoing community spread of COVID - 19 , but further studies with cell culture are needed to evaluate the transmissibility of COVID - 19 from asymptomatic individuals to inform a recom - mendation on universal personal protective equipment .
