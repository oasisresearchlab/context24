Rac signalling to actin—a pathway that is thought to be mediated by the protein Scar / WAVE ( WASP ( Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ) - family verprolin homologous protein ) —has a principal role in cell motility . In an analogous pathway , direct interaction of Cdc42 with the related protein N - WASP stimulates actin polymerization 1 . For the Rac – WAVE pathway , no such direct interaction has been identiﬁed . Here we report a mechanism by which Rac and the adapter protein Nck activate actin nucleation through WAVE1 . WAVE1 exists in a heterotetrameric complex that includes orthologues of human PIR121 ( p53 - inducible messenger RNA with a relative molecular mass ( M r ) of 140 , 000 ) , Nap125 ( NCK - associated protein with an M r of 125 , 000 ) and HSPC300 . Whereas recombinant WAVE1 is consti - tutively active , the WAVE1 complex is inactive . We therefore propose that Rac1 and Nck cause dissociation of the WAVE1 complex , which releases active WAVE1 – HSPC300 and leads to actin nucleation . Members of the Rho family of small GTPases , such as Cdc42 and Rac1 , and of the Src homology ( SH ) domain - containing SH2 – SH3 adapter protein family , such as NCK , link extracellular signals and actin nucleation through pathways that include the WASP family of proteins and the actin nucleation machinery—the Arp2 / 3 complex 1 . All WASP family members contain a conserved verprolin - hom - ology , coﬁlin - homology , acidic ( VCA ) domain that directly binds and activates the Arp2 / 3 complex . The Arp2 / 3 complex , in turn , catalyses the nucleation of actin ﬁlaments 2 . To prevent undesirable spontaneous actin nucleation in the absence of input signals , the activity of the WASP proteins is tightly regulated . For example , N - WASP is found predominantly in an autoinhibited conformation in which the carboxy - terminal VCA domain is occluded through interaction with the amino terminus of the protein 3 , 4 . When Cdc42 binds to the Cdc42 / Rac1 interactive binding ( CRIB ) domain of N - WASP or when NCK binds to the polyproline region of N - WASP , this autoinhibition is relieved and the VCA domain is unmasked . Phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) can further activate N - WASP in cooperation with NCK or Cdc42 by binding to a basic region of N - WASP 5 – 7 . The WAVE proteins ( WAVE1 , WAVE2 and WAVE3 in mammals and orthologues in Drosophila and Dictyostelium 8 – 10 ) are similar in structure to N - WASP 9 . They all have a C - terminal VCA domain , a polyproline region and a basic region . Unlike N - WASP , WAVE proteins do not contain a CRIB domain , and direct binding of WAVE1 to Rac1 has not been detected 8 . But much evidence suggests that WAVE1 functions downstream of Rac1 . WAVE1 is translocated from the cytoplasm to membrane rufﬂes induced by Rac1 ( ref . 8 ) , and dominant - negative WAVE1 abolishes the formation of Rac1 - dependent lamellipodia and Rac1 - dependent neurite extensions 8 .

There - fore , WAVE1 activity is either inhibited in trans by other cellular regulators or regulated by post - translational modiﬁcations . To identify potential trans - inhibitory proteins for WAVE1 acti - vation , we searched for proteins that interact with WAVE1 . We found that all of the detectable WAVE1 protein in soluble bovine brain extracts elutes in size - exclusion chromatography as a complex with an M r of 500K ( data not shown ) . We puriﬁed this complex to about 90 % purity as judged by SDS polyacrylamide gel electro - phoresis ( SDS – PAGE ) and Coomassie blue staining ( Fig . 1a ) . Three proteins co - fractionated and were subsequently co - immunopreci - pitated with WAVE1 ( Fig . 1a ) . The proteins were identiﬁed unambiguously by mass spec - trometry as the bovine orthologues of the following human pro - teins : WAVE1 ; PIR121 ( ref . 12 ) , also named KIAA 0587 ( ref . 13 ) , pop ( ref . 14 ) and CYFIP2 ( ref . 15 ) ; Nap125 ( ref . 16 ) , also named NCKAP1 ( ref . 17 ) , KIAA0168 ( ref . 18 ) and hem - 2 ( ref . 19 ) ; and HSPC300 , which encodes a protein with an M r of 9K ( Fig . 1 ) . The puriﬁed complex migrated with an S ( Svedberg ) value of 9 . 3 which , together with the calculated diffusion coefﬁcient from the size - exclusion chromatography , predicts a theoretical M r of 320K , consistent with a 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 stochiometry of the proteins in the complex . Both Nap125 and PIR121 have been identiﬁed as proteins that bind directly or indirectly to NCK , proﬁlin II and GTP - charged Rac1 . Neither WAVE1 nor HSPC300 has been observed previously in screens for Rac1 - , NCK - and proﬁlin - II - interacting proteins 14 , 16 , 20 , 21 . To test whether WAVE1 activity is inhibited in trans by the other proteins in the complex , we tested the ability of the complex to activate Arp2 / 3 using a pyrene - labelled actin polymerization assay . Whereas recombinant WAVE1 activated the Arp2 / 3 complex , the native WAVE1 complex did not ( Fig . 2a ) . But the activity of the complex in Arp2 / 3 stimulation was increased markedly by GTP g S - charged Rac1 in a dose - dependent manner and to a lesser extent by GDP - charged Rac1 . The half - time for polymerization was 3 . 5 - fold shorter with GTP g S - Rac1 activation and 1 . 5 - fold shorter with GDP - Rac1 , which reﬂects both a shorter lag time for nucleation and an increased maximal elongation rate ( Fig . 2a ) . By contrast , GTP g S - charged Cdc42 had no effect on the activity of the WAVE1 complex ( data not shown ) . In the presence of GTP g S - charged Rac1 , the WAVE1 complex attained a similar activity to that of an equal concentration of puriﬁed glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) – WAVE1 ( Fig . 2a ) , which suggests that Rac1 is fully effective in relieving the inhibition of WAVE1 in the complex . Because both Nap125 and PIR121 associate with NCK 16 , we tested whether NCK can activate the WAVE1 complex . Both recombinant full - length NCK ( Fig . 2b ) and a recombinant fragment of NCK containing only the three SH3 domains of NCK ( named SH3 ( 1 (cid:135) 2 (cid:135) 3 ) ; data not shown ) activated the WAVE1 complex , which shows that the SH2 domain of NCK is dispensable for activation . The association of Nap125 to NCK has been mapped to the ﬁrst SH3 domain of NCK 16 . In agreement with this observation , the recombinant SH3 ( 1 ) domain of NCK 5 activated the complex just as effectively as did full - length NCK ( Fig . 2b ) . By contrast , an NCK protein fragment that only contained the second and third SH3 domains 5 , SH3 ( 2 (cid:135) 3 ) , had no activity ( Fig . 2b ) , which indicates that SH3 ( 1 ) is both necessary and sufﬁcient for WAVE1 activation . Figure 3 Disassembly of the WAVE1 complex by Rac1 and Nck enables activation . a , b , Puriﬁed WAVE1 complex was applied to a Superose 6 size - exclusion column in XB buffer with 10 % glycerol alone ( left ) or in the presence of GTP g S - charged GST – Rac1 ( middle ) or Nck ( right ) .

Although N - WASP contains a basic region that mediates PIP 2 - induced activation of N - WASP 5 , 6 , the small basic region in WAVE1 does not seem to have a similar function because PIP 2 did not activate the WAVE1 complex further ( data not shown ) . GTP g S - charged Rac1 and NCK activated the WAVE1 complex in an additive manner ( Fig . 2c ) . In a simple mechanism , Rac1 and NCK could relieve the inhi - bition of WAVE1 in the complex by stimulating disassembly of the complex and thereby releasing active WAVE1 . To test this model , we analysed the puriﬁed complex in the presence or absence of the activator proteins by size - exclusion chromatography . Whereas the intact , inactivecomplexelutedatan M r of500K , onadditionofNCK or GTP g S - charged GST – Rac1 , the complex disassembled into two subcomplexes : WAVE1 and HSPC300 , which co - fractionated as a complex of 180K ; and PIR121 and Nap125 , which co - eluted as a complex of 450K ( Fig . 3a , b ) . Nap125 and PIR121 remained associated and could be co - immunoprecipitated ( data not shown ) . The activator proteins ( NCK and GST – Rac1 ) did not co - elute with PIR121 and Nap125 , which possibly reﬂects a weakly bound complex that dissociated on passage through the column . To determine whether disassembly of the complex contributes to activation of WAVE1 , we tested the size - exclusion fractions with either NCK or GST – Rac1 for Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin nucleation . The fractions containing PIR121 and Nap125 showed no activity ( data not shown ) , whereas the WAVE1 - and HSPC300 - containing fractions ( fraction 21 ) stimulated actin nucleation ( Fig . 3c ) . These results indicate that NCK or Rac1 may cause disassembly of the complex and that this dissociation may activate WAVE1 . To clarify further which of the proteins in the WAVE1 complex might associate with Rac1 , we incubated beads coated with GTP g S - charged GST – Rac1 with bovine brain extract . Nap125 and PIR121 , but not WAVE1 , associated with the beads , but showed a much lower afﬁnity for the GDP - charged GST – Rac1 that was used as a control ( Fig . 3d ) . In summary , although WAVE1 had been implicated as the down - stream target of Rac1 , no regulatory linkage had been found previously . Consequently , the important Rac1 - dependent pathway for actin nucleation has not been described . Similarly , although the association of NCK and Rac1 with NAP125 and PIR121 has been observed in several screens 14 , 16 , 20 , 21 , their role as regulators of actin nucleation has not been shown . Our results indicate that WAVE1 , like N - WASP and WASP , mediates signals from NCK and the Rho GTPases . The activation mechanisms of WAVE1 and N - WASP are very different : N - WASP is autoinhibited , whereas WAVE1 is trans - inhibited . The action of Rac1 and NCK is to disassemble the trans - inhibited WAVE1 complex , which releases the active WAVE1 pro - tein in association with HSPC300 . Consistent with this model , Rac1 and WAVE1 do not colocalize in the lamellipodium : WAVE1 is localized at the extreme edge of the lamellipodium , whereas Rac1 is distributed diffusely over the lamellipodium 22 , 23 . Rac1 might remain bound to the NAP125 and PIR121 dissociated from the WAVE1 complex , but this has not been tested in vivo . Preliminary obser - vations indicate that there is a similar regulation by trans - inhibition of WAVE2 in HeLa cells ( H . Ho , R . R . and M . W . K . , unpublished data ) . Although the predominant regulation of WAVE1 activity described here is relief of trans - inhibition , an additional positive regulation by proteins that bind WAVE1 directly in an activator - independent manner is also possible . For example , IRSp53 has been reported to bind WAVE2 directly and enhance activation of Arp2 / 3 by recombinant WAVE2 ( ref . 24 ) . Preliminary data show that HSPC300 , which remains associated with WAVE1 after activation , may also have a stimulating function on actin polymerization . The activation and dissociation of the WAVE1 complex process releases a subcomplex of NAP125 and PIR121 , and this subcomplex may be free to interact with other cellular components . In this way , a Rac1 or NCK signal might potentially coordinate several cellular pro - cesses—similar to pathways that are activated by the a - and the b g - subunits in heterotrimeric G - protein signalling . Note added in proof : We have recently detected a ﬁfth protein in the complex that co - migrates with WAVE1 on SDS – PAGE . We have identiﬁed this protein by mass spectrometry as the bovine ortho - logue of the human Abi2 ( Abl Interactor 2 ) ( NCBI database accession number NP _ 005750 ) ( S . E . , H . Ho , H . Steen and S . P . Gygi , unpublished work ) . Abi2 is highly homologous to hNap1 binding protein , previously described as a protein interacting with Nap125 . Indeed , Abi2 appears to remain associated with the Nap125 - Pir121 sub - complex upon dissociation of the WAVE1 complex ( see Fig . 3 ) .

Protein kinases are involved in stress signalling in both plant and animal systems . The hormone abscisic acid mediates the responses of plants to stresses such as drought , salinity and cold . Abscisic - acid - activated protein kinase ( AAPK ) —found in guard cells , which control stomatal pores—has been shown to regulate plasma membrane ion channels 1 . Here we show that AAPK - interacting protein 1 ( AKIP1 ) , with sequence homology to heterogeneous nuclear RNA - binding protein A / B , is a substrate of AAPK . AAPK - dependent phosphorylation is required for the interaction of AKIP1 with messenger RNA that encodes dehy - drin , a protein implicated in cell protection under stress con - ditions . AAPK and AKIP1 are present in the guard - cell nucleus , and in vivo treatment of such cells with abscisic acid enhances the partitioning of AKIP1 into subnuclear foci which are reminiscent of nuclear speckles . These results show that phosphorylation - regulated RNA target discrimination by heterogeneous nuclear RNA - binding proteins 2 may be a general phenomenon in eukar - yotes , and implicate a plant hormone in the regulation of protein dynamics during rapid subnuclear reorganization . Guard cells regulate the apertures of microscopic stomatal pores on the leaf epidermis through which plants take up CO 2 and lose O 2 and water vapour . Appropriate regulation of stomatal aperture in response to environmental conditions , achieved byosmotic swelling and shrinking of guard cells , is vital for plant productivity and drought resistance 3 , 4 . We previously used de novo sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry to obtain peptide sequence information that allowed us to clone the complementary DNA encoding AAPK from the fava bean , Vicia faba 1 . Expression of a dominant negative form of AAPK in guard cells prevented activation by abscisic acid ( ABA ) of anion channels and stomatal closure , implicating AAPK in †Present address : Department of Cell Biology , Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 , USA . letters to nature NATURE | VOL 418 | 15 AUGUST 2002 | www . nature . com / nature 793 © 2002 Nature PublishingGroup
