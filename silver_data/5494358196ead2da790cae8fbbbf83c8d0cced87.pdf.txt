Chromatin ﬁber breaks into clutches under tension and crowding Shuming Liu , † , ‡ Xingcheng Lin , † , ‡ and Bin Zhang ∗ , † † Department of Chemistry , Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge , MA , USA ‡ Contributed equally to this work E - mail : binz @ mit . edu Abstract The arrangement of nucleosomes inside chromatin is of extensive interest . While in vitro experiments have revealed the formation of 30 nm ﬁbers , most in vivo studies have failed to conﬁrm their presence in cell nuclei . To reconcile the diverging experimental ﬁndings , we characterized chromatin organization using a near atomistic model . The computed force - extension curve matches well with measurements from single - molecule experiments . Notably , we found that a dodeca - nucleosome in the two - helix zigzag conformation breaks into structures with nucleosome clutches and a mix of trimers and tetramers under tension . Such unfolded conﬁgurations can also be stabilized through trans interactions with other chromatin chains . Our study supports a hypothesis that disordered , in vivo chromatin conﬁgurations arise as folding intermediates from regular ﬁbril structures . We further revealed that chromatin segments with ﬁbril or clutch structures engaged in distinct binding modes and discussed the implications of these inter - chain interactions for a potential sol - gel phase transition . 1 Introduction Eukaryotic genomes are packaged into nucleosomes by wrapping DNA around histone pro - teins . While the structure of a single nucleosome has been extensively characterized , 1 – 3 the organization for a string of nucleosomes , i . e . , chromatin , remains debatable . 4 – 6 Regular , ﬁbril conﬁgurations are commonly observed in experiments that study chromatin materials extracted from the nucleus . 7 – 10 The invention of in vitro reconstituted nucleosome arrays with strong - positioning DNA sequences 11 helped to remove sample heterogeneity in nucleosome spacing and made possible the determination of high - resolution structures . 12 – 16 However , despite the large amount of evidence supporting their formation in vitro , ﬁbril structures are rarely detected by in vivo experiments that have managed to characterize chromatin at a ﬁne resolution . 17 – 20 Therefore , their biological relevance has been questioned , and chromatin organization inside the nucleus remains controversial . It is worth noting that the nuclear environment is rather complex . In addition to inter - actions among nucleosomes , many factors , including tension and crowding , can impact chro - matin organization . Chromatin is known to associate with various force - generating protein molecules involved in transcription and nucleosome remodeling . 21 – 25 Furthermore , chromatin is often attached to the nuclear envelope and other liquid droplet - like nuclear bodies . 26 – 29 Dy - namical ﬂuctuations in these nuclear landmarks could exert forces on chromatin as well . 30 , 31 Finally , local nucleosome density can be quite high , especially in heterochromatin regions . 32 Such a crowded environment could lead to cross - chain contacts that might compete with interactions stabilizing single - chain conformations . 17 Therefore , both tension and crowding could destabilize the most stable conﬁguration for isolated chromatin . Unfolding from the ﬁbril conﬁguration may provide a simple yet appealing explanation for the lack of regular chromatin organization inside the nucleus . Recently , we explored the folding landscape and pathways of a tetranucleosome , i . e . , a minimal ﬁbril unit . 33 Schalch et al . captured the tetra - nucleosome in a two - helix zigzag conformation with X - ray crys - tallography . 34 Unfolded tetra - nucleosome conﬁgurations from the crystal structure indeed 2 resemble those reported by in vivo studies , including the formation of trinucleosome mo - tifs . 35 Whether the same conclusion can be generalized to longer chromatin segments and whether tension and crowding stabilize unfolding intermediates remain to be shown . Chromatin unfolding has indeed been studied extensively with various techniques . 36 , 37 Single - molecule force spectroscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing chromatin organiza - tion under tension . 38 – 41 Force - extension curves at low - force regimes are particularly infor - mative regarding inter - nucleosomal interactions . 42 Single - molecule F¨orster resonance energy transfer is another popular technique for probing nucleosome contacts and chromatin con - formational dynamics . 43 – 46 Mesoscopic modeling has also been frequently used to interpret experimental data with structural details . 47 – 54 However , because of the experimental tech - niques’ low resolution and assumptions on nucleosome - nucleosome interactions introduced in computational models , the exact conformations of unfolded chromatin have not reached a consensus and necessitates further investigations . We perform computer simulations of a 12 - nucleosome - long chromatin segment ( 12mer ) to investigate chromatin unfolding under tension and crowding . Near - atomistic representations are adopted for protein and DNA molecules to capture their interactions with physical chem - istry potentials at high resolution . Using a combination of enhanced sampling techniques and machine learning , we show that the computed force - extension curve agrees well with results from single - molecule force spectroscopy experiments . 55 Our simulations support chromatin unfolding under tension proceeds through intermediate structures with nucleosome clutches , i . e . , conﬁgurations that have been directly observed via super - resolution imaging of cell nucleus . 56 These structures sacriﬁce nucleosomal DNA by unwrapping to preserve close con - tacts among neighboring nucleosomes . In addition , the presence of another 12mer promotes inter - chain interactions to stabilize extended chromatin conﬁgurations as well . Together , our results suggest that in vivo chromatin conﬁgurations can arise from the unfolding of ﬁbril conﬁgurations as a result of tension and crowding . 3 A B C 4 pN 0 pN Fit Z ext per nucleosome ( nm ) ExperimentSimulation End - to - end distance per nucleosome ( nm ) F r ee ene r g y ( k B T ) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 5 10 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 0 5 10 −10 0 10 20 30 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 F o r c e ( p N ) Figure 1 : Near - atomistic modeling reproduces the force - extension curve for chro - matin .

Results Near - atomistic modeling reproduces force - extension curve We applied a near - atomistic model to characterize the unfolding of a 12mer chromatin with a linker length of 20 bp ( Figure 1A ) . One bead per amino acid and three sites per nucleotide were employed to describe protein and DNA molecules , respectively , leading to a system of 23590 coarse - grained beads in size . Interactions among the coarse - grained beads were param - eterized by accounting for solvent eﬀect implicitly with physically motivated potentials ( see Methods for model details ) . Similar approaches have been extensively used to characterize single nucleosomes 57 – 59 and nucleosome oligomers 33 , 60 with great success . We computed the average chromatin extension length under various pulling forces along the z - axis for a direct comparison with results from single - molecule pulling experiments . 55 Comprehensive sampling of chromatin conformations can be rather challenging because of 4 the non - speciﬁc and strong electrostatic interactions between nucleosomes that give rise to slow dynamics . To alleviate the sampling diﬃculty , we carried out umbrella simulations 61 on two collective variables that quantify the degree of nucleosomal DNA unwrapping ( q wrap ) and nucleosome unstacking ( d stack ) ( Figure S1 ) . The simulations were initialized from the most probable conﬁgurations at respective umbrella centers obtained from an exhaustive sampling of a neural network model that approximates the free energy landscape of the 12mer in terms of inter - nucleosome distances ( see Methods ) . This initialization protocol attempts to prepare umbrella simulations with equilibrium conﬁgurations to avoid traps of local minima . As shown in Figure 1B , the simulation results match well with the experimental force - extension curve measured by Kaczmarczyk et al . 55 In particular , we observe a linear extension regime at low forces ( ≤ 3 pN ) . The sharp increase in extension at 4 pN deviates from the linear behavior , resulting in a plateau regime . We emphasize that there are no tuning parameters in the model , and we do not make assumptions regarding stacking energies . The minor deviation at 4 pN between simulation and experiment could be due to a diﬀerence in salt concentration : while experiments were performed at 100 mM monovalent salt , we carried out the simulations at 150 mM . Reducing the salt concentration to 100 mM in simulations indeed improved the agreement in the average extension length ( Figure S2 ) . The free energy proﬁles as a function of the DNA end - to - end distance are consistent with the linear and plateau regimes seen in force - extension curves ( Figure 1C ) . In particular , at 0 pN force , the free energy curve can be well approximated with a harmonic potential , which naturally produces a linear relationship between the force and extension . Consistent with a harmonic behavior near the minimum , theoretical predictions based on the free energy proﬁle at 0 pN match well with simulation results at 1 - 3 pN ( Figure S3 ) . However , the free energy proﬁle at 4 pN is strongly anharmonic . The bottom panel shows that the curve is relatively ﬂat over a wide range of end - to - end distances . Because of the lack of energetic penalty , a slight change in pulling force can produce signiﬁcant variations in the extension length , giving rise to the observed plateau regime . 5 1 pN 30 nm 2 pN 39 nm 3 pN 49 nm 4 pN 174 nm Figure 2 : Representative chromatin structures from simulations performed under various extension forces ( also see Figure S4 ) .

Intermediate states support nucleosome - clutch formation The nucleosome arrangement in extended , unfolded chromatin has been the subject of nu - merous studies . 39 , 41 , 46 , 49 The near - atomistic simulations performed here oﬀer a unique op - portunity to produce high - resolution structures with minimal assumptions . Their success in reproducing experimental observations shown in Figures 1B and S2 supports the biological relevance of the predicted structures . We determined representative structures at various forces to better characterize chro - matin unfolding under tension ( Figure 2 ) . These structures share end - to - end distances close to the mean force - dependent extension lengths . They correspond to the central conﬁgu - rations of the largest clusters identiﬁed by the single - linkage algorithm 62 using root mean squared distance ( RMSD ) as the distance between structures .

( B ) The free energy proﬁle as a function of the two diﬀerent modes of breaking inter - nucleosome distances shown in part A . though chromatin extends linearly , we do not observe a uniform extension of nucleosomes along the principal ﬁber axis ( Figures 2 and S4 ) . The conformational change mainly occurred in the plane perpendicular to the ﬁber axis via a shearing motion , causing the formation of irregular , compact structures . Such structures are more kinetically accessible as they avoid complete unstacking , which could cause a signiﬁcant energetic penalty as shown by Moller et al . 57 The preference of shearing over complete unstacking can be readily seen in Figure 3 . There , we decomposed the distance between two nucleosomes into motions that are within or perpendicular to the nucleosomal plane ( Figure S5 ) . We further computed the free en - ergy proﬁle for the two decomposed distances under no extension force . It is evident that the energetic penalty for chromatin unfolding along the shearing direction is much smaller . Shearing can better preserve inter - nucleosome contacts as nucleosomes move away from each other , lowering the energetic penalty . The representative structure from 3 pN to 4 pN undergoes a dramatic transformation 7 105 nm 104 nm 258 nm Figure 4 : Representative chromatin structures at smaller and larger distances than the average extension at 4 pN force ( see also Figure S6 ) . These structures again support the formation of nucleosome clutches , which do not break into single nucleosomes until at very large end - to - end distances around 260 nm . from a compact conﬁguration to one with many nucleosomes losing stacking interactions . Notably , the unfolded structures fall into small clusters of nucleosomes . These structures often feature one or two nucleosomes with a highly unwrapped outer layer . Unwrapping the outer layer DNA only incurs modest energetic cost 58 , 63 , 64 and serves as an economic strategy to extend chromatin under force . Nucleosome clutch formation is not speciﬁc to a particular end - to - end distance and can be readily seen in structures with smaller distances as well ( Figure 4 and S6 ) . We note that the nucleosomes that remain in contact are not perfectly stacked as in the crystal structure of a tetranucleosome , 34 but are somewhat ir - regular as conﬁgurations observed in prior simulations 33 , 52 and in vivo experiments . 19 , 35 , 65 , 66 Further stretching the chromatin eventually leads to conﬁgurations with most of the outer nucleosomal DNA unwrapped . Therefore , our results suggest that chromatin unfolding is not cooperative . Nucleosomes do not uniformly unstack along the chain to extend chromatin . On the contrary , they prefer to stay in close contact as much as possible via the formation of clusters separated by unwrapped nucleosomes . 8 A B d s t a ck ( n m ) two fibers single fiber F r ee ene r g y ( k B T ) D ( k B T ) 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 0 5 10 15 20 d stack and d stack ( nm ) C 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 Inter - chain contacts 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 Figure 5 : Crowding and inter - chain contacts stabilize extended chromatin con - ﬁgurations .

The inset highlights the stacking interactions between inter - chain nucleosomes . Inter - chain contacts stabilize unfolded chromatin The pulling simulations suggest that in vivo conﬁgurations can arise from the unfolding of chromatin ﬁber under tension . Inside the nucleus , chromatin is not in isolation but sur - 9 rounded by other chromatin segments in a crowded environment . 20 , 56 The more exposed nucleosomes in the intermediate conﬁgurations could facilitate inter - chain interactions , fur - ther stabilizing the unfolded structures . To evaluate the impact of crowding on chromatin stability , we computed a two - dimensional free energy proﬁle using simulations with two 12mers . The ﬁrst collective variable quanti - ﬁes the inter - chain contacts as the number of nucleosome pairs within 15 nm . Only pairs with one nucleosome from each chromatin segment were included to deﬁne the contacts . The other dimension measures chromatin extension using the average unstacking of the two chains , ¯ d stack . As shown in Figure 5A , conﬁgurations with close contacts between the two chromatin segments are more favorable . An representative structure for two contacting ﬁbril chromatin identiﬁed by the single - linkage clustering algorithm is provided in Figure 5C . The contacts are mediated mainly by histone tail - DNA interactions , as can been in the inset that provides a zoomed - in view of the interface . Favorable interactions for compact chromatin are consistent with previous simulation studies that support the liquid chromatin state . 67 Notably , the global minimum of the free energy proﬁle resides at larger values for ¯ d stack corresponding to more extended chromatin conﬁgurations . While extending chromatin is unfavorable ( Figure 5B ) , such structures promote close contacts between nucleosomes from diﬀerent chains ( Figure 5D ) . In particular , trans - nucleosomes can now engage in stacking interactions , which are more favorable energetically compared to side - side contacts . 57 The emergence of a new binding mode , unavailable when chromatin is constrained into ﬁbril conﬁgurations , compensates for the energetic penalty of breaking cis - chain contacts . Further extending the chromatin leads to more intertwined structures at rather modest energetic cost ( Figure S7 ) . 10 Conclusions and Discussion We characterized the impact of tension and crowding on chromatin organization with com - putational modeling using a near - atomistic model . Consistent with previous studies , 48 , 49 , 53 we observed both unwrapping of nucleosomal DNA and unstacking between nucleosomes as chromatin unfolds from the ﬁbril conﬁguration . However , these changes are non - uniform and are initially localized to a small set of nucleosomes , leading to the formation of nucleosome clutches separated with unwrapped nucleosomal DNA . Such intermediate structures emerge as a result of balancing intra - and inter - nucleosome interactions . Notably , the simulated intermediate structures resemble in vivo chromatin conﬁgura - tions . For example , super - resolution imaging of the core histone protein H2B in interphase human ﬁbroblast nuclei has revealed the formation of nucleosome clutches of varying size . 56 High - resolution electron tomography studies further support the prevalence of trimers in the clutches . 19 , 35 Cross - linking - based experiments that detect nucleosome contacts in situ support nucleosome clutches with tri - or tetranucleosome as well . 65 , 68 Our results generalize the ﬁndings from a previous study on tetra - nucleosomes . 33 They support in vivo chromatin structures as folding intermediates of the ﬁbril conﬁguration . While the ﬁbril structure with stacked nucleosomes is the most stable conﬁguration for chromatin in isolation , tension can promote unfolding . The clutch conﬁgurations are mostly seen under 4 pN , a value that is indeed within the range expected from molecular motors . 21 We further showed that the unfolded chromatin could promote inter - chain contacts , lead - ing to the formation of interdigitated structures . Such structures present an alternative binding mode compared to the close contacts between two ﬁbril conﬁgurations . In addition to supporting chromatin unfolding in a crowded environment , the interdigitated structures suggest that chromatin may , in fact , form gels at high density inside the nucleus . Gela - tion can form due to the stacking interactions between exposed nucleosomes from diﬀerent chains , which are stronger than side - side interactions that are only accessible for nucleo - somes in closely stacked ﬁbers . Therefore , the two binding modes could help understand the 11 observation of both liquid and gel state of chromatin mixtures . 67 , 69 – 72 In addition to tension and crowding , additional factors could impact chromatin organi - zation as well , including histone modiﬁcations , 73 – 75 linker DNA length , 12 , 60 , 76 – 78 chromatin regulators , 40 , 69 , 79 – 81 and salt concentrations . 66 , 82 – 84 The near - atomistic simulations can be generalized straightforwardly to investigate the role of many factors on the formation of nucleosome clutches . One possible limitation of the modeling approach here is our use of implicit solvation . Additional force ﬁeld development would be needed to quantitatively predict the impact of salt concentration and multivalent ions on chromatin organization and inter - chain contacts . Methods Near - atomistic modeling of chromatin organization We applied a near - atomistic model to study a chromatin segment with twelve nucleosomes . The structure - based model 85 , 86 was used to represent protein molecules with one bead per amino acid and stabilize the tertiary structure of the histone octamer while maintaining the conformational ﬂexibility of disordered tail regions . Protein molecules from diﬀerent nucleosomes interact through both an electrostatic and amino acid - speciﬁc potential . 87 We represented the DNA molecule with three beads per nucleotide using the 3SPN model . 88 Protein - DNA interactions were described with the screened Debye - H¨uckel potential at a salt concentration of 150 mM and the Lennard - Jones potential for excluded volume eﬀect . The near - atomistic model has been used extensively in prior studies to investigate protein - protein / protein - DNA interactions , 81 , 89 the energetics of single nucleosome unwinding , 58 , 63 nucleosome - nucleosome interactions , 57 and the folding pathways of a tetra - nucleosome . 33 More details on the model setup and force ﬁeld parameters can be found in the Supporting Information . The software package LAMMPS 90 was used to perform molecular dynamics simulations 12 with periodic boundary conditions and a time step of 10 fs . The length of the cubic simu - lation box was set as 2000 nm . We used the Nos´e - Hoover style algorithm 91 to maintain the temperature at 300 K with a damping constant of 1 ps . The globular domains of histone pro - teins and the inner layer of nucleosomal DNA were rigidiﬁed , while leaving the outer layer , linker DNA , and disordered histone tails ﬂexible . As shown in Ref . 33 , this treatment does not impact the accuracy in sampling inter - nucleosome interactions but signiﬁcantly reduces the computational cost . Most simulations lasted for more than 10 million steps . Exact trajectory lengths are provided in Tables S1 . We computed the error bars by dividing the data into three equal - length , non - overlapping blocks and calculated the respective quantities using data from each block . The standard deviations of the three estimations were used to estimate the error of the mean . Force extension curves from enhanced sampling To characterize chromatin structures under tension and compute force - extension curves , we introduced two collective variables that monitor the important degrees of freedom for chromatin unfolding . The ﬁrst variable , d stack , measures the average center of mass distance between the i - th and ( i + 2 ) - th nucleosomes . For small values of d stack , nucleosomes are stacked on top of each as in the zigzag conformation . 13 , 34 The second variable , q wrap , quantiﬁes the average degree of nucleosome unwrapping . The two variables can better diﬀerentiate the various chromatin conformations and capture the energetic cost of extension than the DNA end - to - end distance . Mathematical expressions for the two variables are provided in the SI . For extension forces less than 4 pN , we carried out a set of two - dimensional umbrella sampling based on q wrap and d stack . q wrap was restricted to centers from 0 . 45 to 0 . 90 with a spacing of 0 . 15 and a spring constant of 50 . 0 kcal / mol . d stack was restricted to centers from 10 . 0 nm to 30 . 0 nm with a spacing of 5 nm and a spring constant of 0 . 05 kcal / mol / nm 2 . Addi - tional simulations were added to further improve the overlap between umbrella windows and 13 the convergence of free energy calculations . At 4 pN , chromatin can adopt fully unstacked structures with large end - to - end distances . Covering the entire accessible phase space with two dimensional umbrella simulations becomes too costly computationally . Therefore , we restricted to one - dimensional free energy calculations using d stack as the collective variable . All simulations were initialized from the most probable conﬁgurations predicted by a neural network model for chromatin stability under the same umbrella biases ( see below for details ) . Details of the umbrella centers and spring constants used in all simulations are provided in Table S1 . Facilitating conformational sampling with a neural network model for chromatin Conformational sampling for the 12mer is challenging because of the many possible degen - erate conﬁgurations . For example , both unstacking and unwrapping can extend chromatin , and diﬀerent combinations of the two from various nucleosomes can result in a large num - ber of structures that share similar end - to - end distances . Conformational transitions among them are slow due to considerable energetic barriers arising from non - speciﬁc electrostatic interactions . To alleviate the sampling problem , we introduced a neural network model for the 12mer . As detailed in the SI , the model quantiﬁes the stability and the free energy of chromatin structures using inter - nucleosome distances . It was parameterized using mean forces esti - mated with near - atomistic simulations for 10 , 000 independent tetra - nucleosome conﬁgura - tions . The neural network model is computationally eﬃcient and allows exhaustive Monte Carlo sampling to determine the most likely chromatin structures at a given setup . These structures were provided to initialize near - atomistic simulations and free energy calculations . The neural network model is not perfect due to approximations introduced when building the free energy surface with tetra - nucleosome calculations . However , it does reproduce the force - extension curve reasonably well at the lower force regime ( Figure S8 ) . We only used the 14 neural network model for conformational exploration , and all quantitative results presented in the manuscript were obtained with near - atomistic simulations . Exploring the impact of crowding on chromatin extension To study the impact of crowding on chromatin organization , we computed the free energy proﬁle as a function of two collective variables that measure intra - and inter - chain contacts . Umbrella sampling was used to enhance conformational exploration , and details on the restraining centers and constants are provided in Table S2 . Umbrella simulations were initialized from conﬁgurations in which the two chains were separated far apart from each other with zero contacts . For simulations biased toward small values of ¯ d stack < 10nm , we prepared each chromatin with a two - helix zigzag conﬁguration that resembles the cryo - EM structure 13 ( see Figure 1A ) . The rest of simulations were initial - ized with extended chromatin conﬁgurations predicted by the neural network model . More simulation details can be found in the SI .
