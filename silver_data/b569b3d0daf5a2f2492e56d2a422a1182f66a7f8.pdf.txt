Principal Findings : We analyzed the contribution of the branched actin regulator WAVE2 in the development of 3 - dimensional ( 3D ) epithelial structures . WAVE2 - knockdown ( WAVE2 - KD ) cells formed large multi - lobular acini that continued to proliferate at an abnormally late stage compared to control acini . Immunostaining of the cell - cell junctions of WAVE2 - KD acini revealed weak and heterogeneous E - cadherin staining despite little change in actin filament localization to the same junctions . Analysis of cadherin expression demonstrated a decrease in E - cadherin and an increase in N - cadherin protein and mRNA abundance in total cell lysates . In addition , WAVE2 - KD cells exhibited an increase in the mRNA levels of the epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) - associated transcription factor Twist1 . KD of Twist1 expression in WAVE2 - KD cells reversed the cadherin switching and completely rescued the aberrant 3D morphological phenotype . Activity of the WAVE2 complex binding partner Abl kinase was also increased in WAVE2 - KD cells , as assessed by tyrosine phosphorylation of the Abl substrate CrkL . Inhibition of Abl with STI571 rescued the multi - lobular WAVE2 - KD 3D phenotype whereas overexpression of Abl kinase phenocopied the WAVE2 - KD phenotype . Conclusions : The WAVE2 complex regulates breast epithelial morphology by a complex mechanism involving repression of Twist1 expression and Abl kinase activity . These data reveal a critical role for WAVE2 complex in regulation of cellular signaling and epithelial morphogenesis .

Defects in cell - cell interactions can therefore result in disorganization of tissues and hyperplasias , which are known precursors of cancer development . A major type of cell - cell junction that serves both a structural and signaling role is the adherens junction ( AJ ) , for which the minimal functional unit is a dimer of cadherin receptors [ 3 , 4 ] . Cadherins link adjacent cells via their extracellular domains and coordinate interaction with the actin cytoskeleton through cytoplasmic binding partners called catenins . In the mammary gland , alterations in molecules that regulate AJ formation or signaling have been tied to cancer initiation , progression , and metastasis [ 5 , 6 ] . A concerted adhesive switch that frequently occurs in aggressive cancers is known as epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) . EMT is best understood as a developmental process that contributes to mesoderm formation and neural crest delamination [ 6 , 7 ] . A central feature of canonical EMT is cadherin switching from E - cadherin to a mesenchymal family member , usually N - cadherin , to accommodate the more dynamic adhesive activity associated with elevated cell motility . EMT is also thought to contribute to a cancer stem cell phenotype [ 6 , 8 , 9 ] . The mechanism ( s ) by which EMT and EMT - like programs are activated in cancer are poorly understood , but are frequently associated with oncogenic cell signaling and activation of gene expression programs orchestrated by master transcription factors , including TWIST , Snail , Slug , and ZEB1 [ 6 , 7 ] . Another critical determinant of cellular organization and cell - cell adhesion is assembly and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton . Initiation of AJ formation is dependent on protrusion of branched actin - based lamellipodial as well as unbranched filopodial structures [ 10 – 18 ] . In addition , dynamic branched actin has been linked to maintenance of AJs , potentially via regulation of cadherin endocytosis [ 19 – 22 ] . The majority of these studies have focused on adhesion formation on 2 - dimensional ( 2D ) surfaces . By contrast , the contribution of branched actin regulators to higher - order epithelial tissue structures is poorly understood , in part due to early lethality associated with germline loss of a number of PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e64533 Arp2 / 3 complex regulators [ 23 – 30 ] . Interestingly , a recent paper implicated regulators of actin - rich pseudopodial protrusions in EMT [ 31 ] , suggesting a dynamic interplay between lamellipodial actin dynamics and signal regulation of EMT . In this study , we tested the effect of manipulating the branched actin lamellipodia regulator , WAVE2 , on 3 - dimensional ( 3D ) epithelial morphogenesis by MCF10A mammary epithelial cells . WAVE2 - knockdown ( KD ) cells formed large multilobular mam - mary acini , likely due to aberrant ongoing proliferation in late - stage acini . However , WAVE2 depletion also led to a partial EMT - like phenotype with elevated expression of Twist1 mRNA and cadherin switching from E - Cadherin to N - Cadherin . Inter - estingly , the WAVE2 - KD 3D morphologic phenotype was fully rescued by KD of Twist1 , indicating that activation of an EMT - like program is critical to the WAVE2 - KD morphogenesis changes . Moreover , the phenotype was partially rescued by exogenous expression of E - cadherin . Interestingly , Western blot analysis of the Abl substrate CrkL revealed an increase in phosphorylation of the canonical Abl phosphosite Y207 in WAVE2 - KD cells , suggesting that the WAVE2 - binding partner Abl kinase is overly active in WAVE2 - KD cells . In addition , treatment of WAVE2 - KD cells with the Abl / c - kit / PDGFR kinase inhibitor STI571 rescued acinar morphology . Finally , the WAVE2 - KD multilobular morphology was effectively phenocop - ied in control cells by exogenous expression of Abl kinase in parental MCF10A cells . Altogether these data are consistent with a critical role for WAVE2 in controlling 3D epithelial morphogen - esis via regulation of Abl kinase activity and Twist1 levels . Results To understand how dynamic membrane protrusions such as lamellipodia contribute to epithelial morphogenesis in 3D , we expressed shRNA against WAVE2 in MCF10A mammary epithelial cells . WAVE2 is an Arp2 / 3 complex regulator that regulates lamellipodial initiation and stability [ 28 , 29 , 32 ] . Loss of WAVE2 ( Figure 1A – B ) , induced major 3D morphological changes in comparison to control cells , with the formation of large , multi - lobular acini ( Figure 1A , C ) . WAVE2 - KD also led to reduced abundance of other WAVE2 complex members , including Sra1 and Abi1 ( Figure 1B ) . The shRNA sequences against WAVE2 contained multiple mismatches with the corresponding sequences Figure 1 . WAVE2 knockdown uniquely results in aberrant 3D morphology of MCF10A epithelial cells . A .

In sparse 2D culture , WAVE2 - KD cells exhibited reduced cell - cell adhesions and were spread evenly across the plate as single cells , whereas control MCF10A cells formed small colonies ( Figure 1A ) . Consis - tent with previous findings [ 28 , 29 , 32 – 34 ] , lamellipodia and membrane ruffles were largely absent and many cells adopted a rounded morphology in the WAVE2 - KD cells ( Figure 1A ) . We hypothesized that the multi - lobular morphology of WAVE2 - KD cells in 3D culture could be a consequence of either the aggregation of multiple acini , or aberrant growth of single acini . To distinguish between those 2 possibilities , long - term live - cell imaging was performed on control and WAVE2 - KD acini grown from single cells . Movies were taken over a period of 63 hours , beginning at day 4 . 5 when both control and WAVE2 - KD acini were uniformly round and still proliferating ( Figure 2 and Movies S1 – S3 ) . Aggregation of acini was not seen in the WAVE2 - KD cultures . By contrast , there was aberrant continua - tion of the proliferative phase such that selective division of a subpopulation of WAVE2 - KD cells within each acinus led to the development of lobular ‘‘flower - like’’ structures . By day 5 . 5 , no further increase in the size of control acini was observed whereas proliferation of cells in the WAVE2 - KD acini continued for the duration of the movies ( 7 days post - plating , Figure 2 , Movies S1 – S3 ) . To verify that aberrant proliferation was ongoing in late - stage WAVE2 - KD 3D cultures , control and WAVE2 - KD acini were fixed and immunostained with the proliferative marker Ki67 at various time points . Single confocal images through the middle of the acini were analyzed ( Figure 3A ) . At day 10 , low numbers of Ki67 - positive cells were seen in the control acini and there were many more Ki67 - positive cells in the WAVE2 - KD acini . By days 12 and 14 , there were essentially no detectable Ki67 - positive cells in control acini , whereas Ki67 - positive cells were still present in WAVE2 - KD acini ( Figure 3A , B ) . The proliferating cells were predominantly localized to the central edge of each lobe , suggesting that this area contributed to expansion of the multilobe structure over time ( Figure 3A ) . Consistent with the ongoing late - stage proliferation in WAVE2 - KD cells , there was a significant increase in the size of 6 – 12 day WAVE2 - KD acini compared to controls but no size difference in 2 and 4 day acini ( Figure 3C ) . There was no apparent change in apoptosis of the inner cell mass as activated caspase - 3 staining was observed in both control and WAVE2 - KD acini and all acini had hollow lumens ( Figure 3D ) [ 35 ] . There was also no apparent defect in cell polarization based on Laminin - 332 localization to the basal surface of both control and WAVE2 - KD acini ( Figure 3E ) [ 35 ] . Interestingly , there was no difference in the rate of control or WAVE2 - KD cell proliferation in 2D cultures ( Figure 3F ) , indicating that the aberrant ongoing proliferation observed in late - stage WAVE2 acini is a 3D context - dependent event . Because branched actin assembly is critical for proper function of AJs [ 15 , 19 , 22 ] and AJ formation is enhanced in 3D , we hypothesized that alterations in cell - cell adhesion in WAVE2 - KD cells might affect epithelial morphogenesis . To visualize AJs and junctional actin , acini were stained with antibodies against E - Cadherin and Alexa - 568 phalloidin ( single confocal images from the middle of representative acini shown in Figure 4 ) . Heteroge - neous and low - level E - Cadherin expression at cell - cell junctions was seen in WAVE2 - KD acini whereas control acini had comparatively strong and contiguous E - Cadherin expression at cell - cell junctions ( Figure 4A ) . Actin at the cell - cell junctions was surprisingly still present and localized correctly in WAVE2 - KD cells , despite the relative lack of E - cadherin . Quantification of the ratio of E - Cadherin to actin at the cell - cell junctions showed an average 3 - fold decrease of E - Cadherin in the WAVE2 - KD knockdown cells compared to control cells ( Figure 4B ) . The heterogenous staining and overall decrease in the amount of E - Cadherin at cell - cell adhesions in WAVE2 - KD cells was also observed in 2D cultures ( Figure S2 ) , consistent with the reduced 2D colony formation compared to control cells ( Figure 1B ) . The loss of WAVE2 affected cell - cell adhesive strength as determined by a hanging drop assay . In this assay , cells are suspended in media so that they form aggregates and cell - cell junctions rather than adhering to an extracellular matrix substrate . The aggregated cells are then mechanically disrupted by a standardized pipetting regime ; dispersion indicates weak cell - cell junctions [ 36 ] . WAVE2 - KD aggregates were much more easily dispersed into single cells Figure 2 . Large multilobular WAVE2 - KD acini arise from a single acinar structure .

Because WAVE2 - KD cells exhibited heterogeneous and apparent low - level staining of E - cadherin at AJ in both 2D and 3D culture , we hypothesized that the whole cell abundance of E - cadherin might be reduced . Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates from 2D culture demonstrated decreased levels of E - Cadherin in WAVE2 - KD cells compared to control cells ( Figure 5A ) . E - Cadherin is known to be degraded in response to its removal from the cell - cell junction ; alternatively , levels of E - Cadherin can be transcriptionally regulated [ 37 ] . To determine if the mechanism by which E - Cadherin was downregulated in response to loss of WAVE2 was transcriptionally based , we performed quantitative PCR using E - Cadherin specific primers . Surprisingly , we found that there was a 75 % decrease in the relative expression of E - Cadherin mRNA in WAVE2 - KD cells compared to control cells ( Figure 5B ) . Since decreased transcrip - tion of E - cadherin is often a consequence of EMT and occurs in association with increases in N - cadherin expression , we also tested whether N - cadherin mRNA levels were altered . Indeed , consistent with an EMT - like cadherin switch , N - cadherin expression was increased at both the mRNA and protein level ( Figure 5C , D ) . Localization of N - Cadherin was also enhanced at cell - cell adhesions in WAVE2 - KD cells compared to control cells grown in monolayer culture ( Figure S4 ) . Beta - catenin localized to cell junctions in control and WAVE2 - KD cells in both 2D and 3D culture ( Figure S5 ) . To test whether decreased E - cadherin expression could account for the formation of multi - lobular acini in WAVE2 - KD cells , E - cadherin was re - expressed along with GFP under the control of a common promoter and with an internal ribosomal entry site ( IRES ) so that the GFP level within a cell could be used to assess E - Cadherin levels in individual cells . In 2D , re - expression of E - cadherin in WAVE2 - KD cells fully rescued the cell - cell adhesion phenotype , with similar colony formation as control cells ( Figure 5E , compare to KD phenotype in Figure 1E ) . In 3D cultures , however , restoration of normal morphology was observed in many but not all acini , dependent on the level of E - Cadherin expression . Note that since each acinus grows from a single cell , each acinus is clonal and presumably has uniform GFP , E - cadherin and WAVE2 expression . Thus , as shown in the inset in Figure 5E , only WAVE2 - KD acini expressing high levels of GFP and therefore presumably high levels of E - Cadherin were morphologically rescued . To quantitate these results , the acini were split into 2 groups dependent on GFP expression and the average diameter of the acini was measured . High GFP expressing acini had an average diameter similar to that of control cells , whereas low GFP expressing acini were significantly larger ( Figure 5F ) . The mechanisms by which the E - Cadherin gene is transcrip - tionally regulated include alterations in transcription factor activity and epigenetic modification [ 38 – 42 ] . Since our data indicated that WAVE2 loss led to a coordinated decrease in E - cadherin and increase in N - Cadherin mRNA levels , we analyzed the expression of three EMT - associated transcription factors known to drive cadherin switching in breast cancer cell lines , Slug , Snail and Twist1 [ 40 – 42 ] . Slug and Snail were undetectable in both control and WAVE2 - KD MCF10A cells by quantitative PCR ( data not shown ) ; however , expression of Twist1 was upregulated 2 - fold in nuclei .

To determine if the mechanism by which WAVE2 regulates the cadherin mRNA abundance and 3D morphology is through upregulation of Twist1 expression , we knocked down Twist1 in both control and WAVE2 - KD cells using retrovirally transduced shRNA ( Figure 6A ) . As expected , knock - down of Twist1 led to an increase in E - cadherin and a decrease in N - cadherin mRNA abundance in both control and WAVE2 - KD cells ( Figure 6B , C ) , as well as to an increase in the intensity of E - cadherin at cell - cell junctions ( Figure S6 ) . Interestingly , when grown in 3D culture , the knockdown of Twist1 in the WAVE2 - KD cells ( WAVE2 - KD + Twist1 KD ) completely reversed the phenotype of WAVE2 knockdown , with the WAVE2 - KD + Twist1 KD cell acini being morphologically indistinguishable from control acini ( Figure 6D , E , compare to WAVE2 - KD in Figure 1E ) . These data indicate that Twist1 functions downstream of WAVE2 complex to control cadherin RNA abundance and 3D morphogenesis . As sequence analysis of WAVE2 did not reveal any direct DNA binding domains , it seemed likely that the regulation of Twist1 and cadherin mRNA expression was indirect and potentially down - stream of signaling proteins . We therefore searched for known binding partners of WAVE2 complex that have been associated with EMT . A likely intermediary was the WAVE2 - binding partner Abl kinase [ 43 , 44 ] , which was shown in different contexts to either promote [ 45 ] or inhibit [ 46 ] EMT in cultured cell lines . Abl kinase has been shown to bind and activate WAVE2 both via direct interactions with the WAVE2 polyproline domain as well as indirectly through the WAVE complex protein Abi1 [ 43 , 44 ] . In addition , Drosophila Abi has been shown to genetically antagonize Abl activity in synaptogenesis , axonogenesis , and cellular actin distribution [ 47 ] . Thus , we hypothesized that loss of WAVE2 complex members might affect the levels and / or activity of Abl kinase leading to the observed morphological changes . To test whether Abl kinase activity was altered in WAVE2 - KD cells , we performed Western blot analysis of the phosphorylation status of the Abl substrate CrkL [ 48 – 50 ] . Indeed , we found that WAVE2 - KD cells exhibited increased abundance of phosphory - lated CrkL ( Y207 ) ( Figure 7A , Figure S7 ) , suggesting that Abl kinase activity is elevated in WAVE2 - KD cells . Likewise , there was an apparent increase in the intensity and focal adhesion localization of phospho - CrkL immunofluorescent staining in WAVE2 - KD cells compared to controls ( Figure S7 ) . We also performed immunofluorescent staining of Abl kinase and found a slight decrease in Abl localization at cell - cell adhesions in WAVE2 - KD cells ( arrowheads in Figure S8 ) , compared to control cells ( arrows in Figure S8 ) ; however there was no difference in cytoplasmic localization ( Figure S8 ) . To determine whether alteration in Abl kinase levels and / or activity could affect 3D morphogenesis , we overexpressed full length Abl kinase in control cells . Interestingly , similar to WAVE2 - KD , overexpression of wt Abl kinase resulted in the formation of large multi - lobular 3D structures ( Figure 7B ) . We also cultured control and WAVE2 - KD cells in the presence of the Abl kinase inhibitor STI571 for 16 – 20 days . Interestingly , 10 m M STI571 completely reversed the WAVE2 - KD 3D morphological phenotype and led to normally formed small round mammary acini ( Figure 7C ) . As with WAVE2 - KD , treatment with STI571 did not affect cellular localization of beta - catenin ( Figure S5A ) . In addition to Abl kinase , STI571 is known to target c - kit [ 51 ] and PDGFR [ 52 ] ; however , our findings that endogenous phosphorylation of the Abl substrate CrkL is elevated in WAVE2 - KD cells and that overexpression of Abl leads to an identical 3D morphogenesis defect as WAVE2 - KD suggests that Abl is the likely target of STI571 that controls acinar morphogenesis . Discussion The work presented here indicates that the WAVE2 complex plays an important and complex role in 3D morphogenesis of breast epithelial cells , by suppressing proliferation of late stage acini . We also identified a partial EMT - like phenotype in WAVE2 - KD cells , with elevation in Twist1 levels and cadherin switching . Twist1 was linked to the morphogenesis defects , as knockdown of Twist1 in WAVE2 - KD cells fully rescued the acinar development phenotype . Finally , we showed that the WAVE2 complex binding partner Abl also regulates mammary acinus development and is overly active in WAVE2 - KD cells . Altogether , these data present a complex role for the WAVE2 complex in controlling breast epithelial morphogenesis through Abl kinase and the transcription factor Twist1 . Abl kinases have been shown to activate WAVE2 directly through phosphorylation [ 43 , 44 ] and indirectly through Rac [ 53 ] . The WAVE2 complex and Abl have also been reported to co - regulate a variety of functions in diverse cell types , including pathogen entry into cells [ 54 , 55 ] , T - cell signaling [ 56 ] , and induction of membrane ruffling and cell spreading [ 57 ] . Our data indicate that WAVE2 complex not only acts downstream of Abl kinase but also upstream to regulate Abl kinase activity , as indicated by the increased phosphorylation of the Abl substrate CrkL . We also found that incubation of cells in 3D culture with the Abl / c - kit / PDGFR kinase inhibitor STI571 fully rescues the morphology defect of WAVE2 - KD cells . Finally , Abl overexpres - sion induces a multi - lobular acinus morphology that phenocopies that of WAVE2 - KD cells . Taken together , our data are consistent with a model in which the WAVE2 complex can regulate Abl kinase activity and downstream morphogenesis events . Both WAVE2 itself and the WAVE2 complex member Abi1 are known to bind directly to Abl kinase and both were downregulated in WAVE2 - KD cells . It may be difficult to distinguish between effects of WAVE2 and Abi1 , since Abi1 abundance depends on WAVE2 ( Figure 1 ) and vice versa [ 58 , 59 ] . Abl kinase has been previously shown to affect epithelial morphogenesis , especially in Drosophila , through the regulation of actin assembly [ 60 – 63 ] . However , it is also possible that transcription could occur downstream of Abl activity to regulate adherens junction composition either separately or in conjunction with direct effects on actin assembly . the bands indicate average densitometry values from n = 3 blots normalized to control protein levels .

At this point , the mechanism by which the WAVE2 complex regulates Twist1 regulation is unknown . Allington et al . found that Abl suppressed Twist1 expression and cadherin switching downstream of TGF b stimulation by an unknown mechanism [ 46 ] . In the context of WAVE2 - KD , our morphogenesis results suggest a different relationship in which deregulation of Abl kinase activity may enhance Twist1 expression .

Another important experiment will be to determine if KD of Twist1 can rescue the morphogenesis defect of Abl - overexpressing cells . Even so , it would be unclear exactly how Twist1 could be regulated downstream of Abl kinase . These are important topics for future investigation and could lead to identification of novel mechanisms for induction of EMT and / or epithelial morphogenesis pheno - types . An interesting finding from our study was that WAVE2 - KD led to aberrant ongoing proliferation in a 3D environment but not in 2D . One difference between 3D acinar structure and 2D tissue culture conditions is that cell - cell junctions are much more highly developed and occupy a greater proportion of the plasma membrane in 3D . Thus , one possible explanation for the defective repression of late - stage proliferation in WAVE2 - KD MCF10A cells is that altered AJ signaling occurred due to the relative loss of E - cadherin and the increase in N - cadherin at cell - cell junctions . Our finding that the WAVE2 - KD acinar morphogenesis pheno - type could be fully rescued by KD of Twist1 along with reversal of cadherin switching or partially rescued by re - expression of E - cadherin supports this model . Another possibility is that not only cadherins but also other Twist1 targets are involved in promoting the observed morphological changes in WAVE2 - KD acini . For example , Twist and other EMT - promoting transcription factors are known to be critical for branching morphogenesis by promoting not only cadherin switching but also invasion of the surrounding matrix [ 40 , 64 – 66 ] . Enhanced invasiveness combined with the switch to a mesenchymal cadherin might facilitate outgrowth of acinar lobules that then promotes the observed increase in late - stage proliferation . Cell - cell adhesion formation and maintenance is a complex process , involving both dynamic actin and junctional signaling proteins [ 3 ] . WAVE2 and WAVE2 complex members have previously been shown to mediate actin nucleation at cell - cell adhesions and formation of AJs in 2D culture [ 18 , 22 , 67 , 68 ] . However , in 3D culture , we found that there was little effect of WAVE2 expression on junctional actin accumulation ; instead , E - cadherin levels were strongly regulated and morphogenesis defects could be rescued by increasing expression of E - cadherin or knock - down of TWIST1 . Our unexpected finding of transcriptional regulation of E - cadherin and TWIST1 along with deregulation of Abl kinase activity indicates that regulation of AJs by WAVE2 is more complicated than previously appreciated . In support of our finding that WAVE2 loss is associated with defective epithelial morphogenesis , a recent paper identified that the loss of Cyfip1 , a component of the WAVE2 complex that is lost in invasive breast cancers , resulted in aberrant 3D epithelial morphology and defective AJ formation [ 69 ] . Similar changes were found with loss of WAVE2 and other WAVE complex members . Our data are consistent with their findings , but identify a potential signaling mechanism underlying the morphogenesis changes . Furthermore , our finding that WAVE2 complex acts to regulate Abl function and Twist levels suggests a potential selective advantage for loss of WAVE2 complex expression in tumors . Materials and Methods Cell Culture MCF10A cells were obtained from Dr Joan Brugge ( Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA ) and both MCF10A cells and virally transduced MCF10A cell lines were cultured as described [ 70 ] . Viral transduction of MCF10A cells was as described [ 33 ] . 3D acini were grown on a bed of growth factor reduced Matrigel ( BD Biosciences ) in 8 - well chamber slides following the protocol previously described [ 70 ] . Cellular Assays Hanging drop assays were performed as described [ 36 ] . Briefly , a 30 m l drop of cell media containing 0 . 5 6 10 5 cells was placed on the underside of the lid of a 24 well plate . The lid was then inverted over the wells which contained phosphate buffered saline for humidification and incubated overnight . The aggregated cells were then subjected to 20 pipette strokes , then the cellular aggregate / dispersion imaged by brightfield microscopy . Cellular proliferation : 1 6 10 4 cells / well were plated in a 24 well plate . Each day , duplicate wells were trypsinized and the number of cells counted . The experiment was repeated in triplicate and the error bars represent standard error of the mean . Statistical significance was determined by the Student’s t - test . Immunofluorescence and image quantitation For all immunofluorescence and phalloidin staining of both 2 - and 3 - dimensional cultures , the cells / acini were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde and permeabilised with 0 . 4 % TritonX - 100 and mounted in AquaPolymount ( Polysciences Inc . ) . Immunofluores - cence staining of 2D cultures and 3D acini were performed as previously described [ 33 , 70 ] . Widefield fluorescence images were taken on a Nikon TE 2000 - E microscope using a 40X Plan Fluor oil immersion lens objective and captured using a Hamamatsu Orca ER camera and Metamorph software ( MDS Inc . , Toronto , Canada ) . Confocal images were obtained using a Zeiss inverted LSM510 confocal microscopy system using a 40x Plan - NEO - FLUAR ( NA 1 . 3 Oil ; DIC lens ) objective and a Hamamatsu Orca ER camera . Quantitation of Acini size : The average diameter of fixed , DAPI stained acini were measured from fluorescence images using ImageJ ( version 1 . 45s ) . 10 acini of each cell type at each time point were measured and the average diameter ( in pixels ) presented . The average diameter ( m m ) of live acini were measured from phase contrast images using ImageJ ( version 1 . 45s ) . GFP expressing acini were sorted into 2 groups , below 100 and over 100 average pixel intensity then the diameter measured . Junctional intensity : Regions of interest were defined as approximately 1 pixel on either side of the b - actin cell - cell junction localization of a dual stained sample . The ROI was then transferred to the second image and the average fluorescent intensity of E - Cadherin or beta - catenin immunostaining measured using ImageJ ( version 1 . 45s ) . 50 cell - cell junctions per sample were measured . The error bars represent standard error of the mean . Statistical significance was determined by the Student’s t - test . Antibodies and Reagents Antibodies for Western blotting and immunofluorescence were as follows : E - Cadherin , N - Cadherin , ( BD Biosciences ) , WAVE2 ( Upstate ) , Sra - 1 , Abi - 1 ( Santa Cruz ) , Ki - 67 ( Calbiochem ) , activated caspase - 3 , b - actin , P - Tyr 207 CrkL and GAPDH ( all from Cell Signaling Technology ) , Laminin - 332 ( Chemicon ) . Anti - rabbit and anti - mouse HRP conjugated secondary antibodies were from GE Healthcare . Anti - mouse and anti - rabbit Alexa - 488 or Alexa - 568 conjugated secondary antibodies , Alexa - 488 phalloidin and Alexa - 568 phalloidin were from Invitrogen . STI 571 was obtained from LC Labs . WAVE2 Regulates EMT Signaling PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 10 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e64533 Live - Cell Imaging Acini were grown in 8 - well chamber slides and after 4 . 5 days of culture the media was changed to L15 media with the required supplements to allow growth in a low CO 2 atmosphere . Cells were imaged on a Nikon TE 2000 - E microscope at 37 u C in a humidified environment using a 10X Plan Fluor 0 . 3NA objective and captured using a Hamamatsu Orca ER camera and Metamorph software ( MDS Inc . , Toronto , Canada ) for 2 . 5 days . Phase contrast images were taken at multiple stage positions every 30 minutes . The individual images are displayed at a frame rate of 30 frames per second in the resultant movies . Construction of siRNA and retroviral expression constructs Sixty four base pair oligonucleotides ( IDT ) containing the sense and antisense sequences flanking a 6 base hairpin were inserted into the pRS vector ( OligoEngine ) . The sense sequences used were WAVE2 - KD1 catacaatacctgtgatac [ 33 ] , WAVE2 - KD2 gaaaga - taatccaaatcga [ 71 ] and Twist aagctgagcaagattcagacc [ 72 ] . The E - Cadherin IRES GFP construct has been previously described [ 73 ] . The MSCV2 . 2 - based vector pTK209 . 5 was generated by inserting the 1 . 4 kb BamHI EcoRI frament containing an IRES - neoR cassette from into the BamHI - EcoRI sites of MSCV2 . 2 . The murine c - abl type IV cDNA was excised from the pPL vector [ 74 ] via digestion at the 5 9 end with EcoRI , blunting of 5 9 end with Klenow , ligation of 5 9 end to NotI linkers . The cDNA was subsequently cut with HindIII at the 3 9 end , blunted with Klenow , and cut with NotI . The resulting 3 . 4 fragment containing c - abl was cloned into pTK209 . 5 that was digested with XhoI , blunted with Klenow fragment , ligated to NotI linkers , and digested with NotI , HpaI and shrimp alkaline phosphatase . Quantitative real time PCR RNA was extracted ( RNAeasy , Qiagen ) and cDNA generated ( iScript reverse transcriptase , Biorad ) according to the manufac - turer’s instructions . Real time PCR was performed using a BioRad iCycler . For each experimental sample , transcript levels were analyzed by the 2 2 DD Ct method . Transcript levels were normal - ized to GAPDH levels and analysed in triplicate . The primers used for WAVE2 were tctgataccaccaagcccaa ( forward ) and cacaa - catcccgcttctctt ( reverse ) . All other primers used for QPCR have been previously described ( WAVE1 , WAVE3 [ 75 ] , E - Cadherin , hTwist , Slug [ 76 ] , hGAPDH [ 77 ] , h b - actin [ 78 ] , and Snail [ 79 ] .
