RED CELLS Intracellular kinetics of iron in reticulocytes : evidence for endosome involvement in iron targeting to mitochondria An - Sheng Zhang , Alex D . Sheftel , and Prem Ponka In erythroid cells the vast majority of iron ( Fe ) released from endosomes must cross both the outer and the inner mitochon - drial membranes to reach ferrochelatase that inserts Fe into protoporphyrin IX . In the present study , we developed a method whereby a cohort of 59 Fe - transferrin ( Tf ) – laden endosomal vesicles were gener - ated , from which we could evaluate the transfer of 59 Fe into mitochondria . Iron chelators , dipyridyl or salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone ( SIH ) , were able to bind the 59 Fe when they were present during a 37°C incubation ; however , addi - tion of these agents only during lysis at 4°C chelated virtually no 59 Fe . Baﬁlomy - cin A1 ( which prevents endosome acidiﬁ - cation ) and succinylacetone ( an inhibitor of 5 - aminolevulinate dehydratase ) pre - vented endosomal 59 Fe incorporation into heme . Importantly , both the myosin light chain kinase inhibitor wortmannin and the calmodulin antagonist , N - ( 6 - amino - hexyl ) - 5 - chloro - 1 - naphthalene - sulfonamide ( W - 7 ) , caused signiﬁcant inhibition of 59 Fe incorporation from 59 Fe - Tf – labeled endo - somes into heme , suggesting that myo - sin is required for Tf - vesicle movement . Our results reafﬁrm the astonishing efﬁ - ciencyofTf - derivedFeutilizationinhemo - globin ( Hb ) – producing cells and demon - strate that very little of this Fe is present in a chelatable pool . Collectively , these results are congruent with our hypoth - esis that a transient endosome - mitochon - drion interaction mediates iron transfer between these organelles . ( Blood . 2005 ; 105 : 368 - 375 ) © 2005 by TheAmerican Society of Hematology Introduction Normal hemoglobinization of immature erythroid cells requires iron uptake from transferrin ( Tf ) , mediated by Tf receptors , whose high levels are essential for maintaining the exceptionally rapid rates of heme synthesis . On a per - cell basis the rate of heme synthesis in immature erythroid cells is at least an order of magnitude higher than in the liver , the second highest heme producer in the organism . 1 Following the binding of Fe ( III ) 2 - Tf to Tf receptors on the erythroid cell membrane , the Tf - receptor complexes are internalized by endocytosis , and iron is then released from Tf by a process involving endosomal acidiﬁcation . 1 - 3 The transporter , Nramp2 ( also known as DMT1 4 or DCT1 5 ) , has been shown to be likely responsible for the egress of iron from the endosome . 6 - 8 This protein is encoded by a gene that belongs to the “natural resistance - associated macrophage protein” ( Nramp ) fam - ily of genes identiﬁed by Gros and his coworkers 9 and transports Fe ( II ) . 5 Therefore , reduction of Fe ( III ) must occur in endosomes ; however , nothing is known about the mechanism of this process . It is generally believed that following its release from endosomes , iron enters the cytosol where it equilibrates with a low molecular weight labile iron pool . 10 , 11 However , the extraordinary efﬁciency of Fe utilization in erythroid tissues , as well as the apparent targeting of Fe to mitochondria ( as discussed in the next para - graph ) , may be inconsistent with such a model . In hemoglobin - synthesizing cells , the vast majority of iron released from endosomes must cross both the outer and the inner mitochondrial membranes to reach ferrochelatase . 1 It is remarkable that in these cells iron acquired from Tf continues to ﬂow into mitochondria , even when the synthesis of protoporphyrin IX is markedly compromised in vitro ( by isonicotinic acid hydrazide [ INH ] or succinylacetone [ SA ] ) 12 - 16 or in vivo ( patients with erythroid speciﬁc 5 - aminolevulinate synthase deﬁciency 17 ) . A signiﬁcant proportion of nonheme iron that accumulates in mito - chondria under these circumstances is in a form readily available for heme synthesis when protoporphyrin IX formation is re - stored . 12 , 13 , 16 Interestingly , when heme synthesis is inhibited in deﬁnitive erythroid cells , very little 13 , 16 or no 18 iron accumulates in cytosolic ferritin . In contrast , it is well established that in normal nonerythroid cells , iron in excess of metabolic needs ends up in ferritin . Thus , it seems highly likely that in erythroid cells the transport of iron into mitochondria is controlled differently than in nonerythroid cells . Because Tf - bound iron is extremely efﬁciently used for hemo - globin synthesis , because iron is targeted into erythroid mitochon - dria , and because no low molecular weight cytoplasmic iron transport intermediate has been identiﬁed in reticulocytes , a new hypothesis of intracellular iron transport has been suggested . 1 , 16 This model proposes that , after iron is released from Tf in the endosome , it is passed directly from endosomal protein to mitochon - drial protein until it reaches ferrochelatase in the mitochondrion , thus bypassing the cytosol . In the present study we developed a method to speciﬁcally label reticulocyte endosomes with 59 Fe and showed that the use of this From the Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research , Jewish General Hospital , Montreal , QC , Canada ; the Department of Physiology , McGill University , Montreal , QC , Canada ; theDepartmentofCellularandDevelopmentalBiology , Oregon Health Sciences University , Portland .

Additionally , we showed that 59 Fe ﬂux from endosomes into heme can be intercepted by the membrane permeable chelators dipyridyl ( DP ) and salicylaldehyde isonicoti - noyl hydrazone ( SIH ) , but the 59 Fe - chelates can be formed only in metabolically active cells . We also found that myosin light chain kinase inhibitors , wortmannin ( WT ) and 1 - 5 ( - chloronaphthalene - 1 - sulfonyl ) - 1h - hexahydro - 1 , 4 - diazepine ( ML - 9 ) , as well as the cal - modulin antagonist , N - ( 6 - aminohexyl ) - 5 - chloro - 1 - naphthalene - sulfonamide ( W - 7 ) , caused signiﬁcant inhibition of 59 Fe incorporation from 59 Fe - Tf – labeled endosomes into heme . All these agents are known to inhibit the microﬁlament motor , myosin , which thus appears to be involved in intracellular movement of endosomes . Collectively , these results support the hypothesis that intracellular translocation of Fe involves a transient interaction between endocytic vesicles and mitochondria .

(cid:1) , (cid:1)(cid:2) - dipyridyl ( DP ) was obtained from Fisher Scientiﬁc ( Fair Lawn , NJ ) . 59 FeCl 3 was purchased from Amersham ( Buckinghamshire , United Kingdom ) and 125 I from ICN ( Irvine , CA ) . SIH was synthesized as previously described . 19 Apo - Tf was labeled with 59 Fe using 59 Fe - citrate as described , 20 yielding approximately 80 % saturated Tf ( the other 20 % being a mixture of monoferric and apo - transferrin ) . Reticulocyte preparation CD1 mice were injected with neutralized phenylhydrazine ( intraperitone - ally ) at a dose of 50 mg / kg / d for 3 continuous days . On the 3rd or 4th day following the last injection blood was taken from the heart under ether anesthesia using heparin as anticoagulant . After 3 washes with ice - cold phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , the cells ( about 45 % reticulocytes , as determined by new methylene blue staining ) were resuspended in the incubation medium ( Minimum Essential Media [ MEM ] containing 25 mM N - 2 - hydroxyethylpiperazine - N (cid:2) - 2 - ethanesulfonic acid [ HEPES ] , 10 mM NaHCO 3 , pH 7 . 4 , and 1 % BSA ) and referred to as “reticulocytes . ” Preparation of reticulocytes containing 59 Fe - labeled endosomes and measurement of 59 Fe transfer into mitochondria To eliminate the possible effects of various reagents on endocytosis , rates of 59 Fe - heme synthesis were measured from internalized 59 Fe - Tf present within endosomes . The protocol to speciﬁcally label reticulocyte endo - somes with 59 Fe is illustrated in Figure 1 . Brieﬂy , reticulocytes depleted of endogenous Tf ( period 1 ) were incubated ( 0 - 4°C / 60 minutes ) with 2 (cid:3) M 59 Fe - Tf to saturate membrane Tf receptors with 59 Fe - Tf ( period 2 ) . To obtain a “cohort” of 59 Fe - containing endosomes , samples were warmed up at 37°C for 1 minute by adding 4 volumes of prewarmed medium containing excess 56 Fe - Tf ( 10 (cid:3) M ﬁnal concentration ) to allow endocytosis of 59 Fe - Tf ( period 3 ) . After 3 washes with cold PBS the reticulocyte pellet was resuspended in incubation medium containing 56 Fe - Tf ( 10 (cid:3) M ﬁnal concentration ) and incubated on ice for an additional 2 hours to exchange remaining membrane - associated 59 Fe - Tf with 56 Fe - Tf ( period 4 ) , followed by a wash with cold incubation medium in which the cells were incubated during period 5 . Measurements of cellular heme and non - heme 59 Fe were performed either by an acid precipitation method 12 or by acid methyl ethyl ketone extraction 21 ; because both methods yielded virtually identical results , the acid precipitation method was used for convenience . The radioiron measurements were carried out in a LKB Compugamma Counter ( LKB Instruments , Pleasant Hill , CA ) . At the beginning of period 5 ( Figure 1 ) reticulocytes contained up to 40 % of 59 Fe in their heme , indicating a remarkably efﬁcient transfer of radioactive iron into heme during period 3 ; this can be prevented by heme synthesis inhibitors ( INH , SA ) or chelators such as SIH and DP ( data not shown ) . Additionally , preliminary experi - ments indicated that there was no incorporation of cell - associated 59 Fe into Figure 1 . Protocol to prepare reticulocytes containing 59 Fe - labeled endosomes .

During incubation of reticulocytes at 37°C ( period 5 ) , 59 Fe radioactivity in heme rapidly increased , reaching 90 % within 20 minutes ; generally , effects of various agents were assessed during this period . ( This method was used in experiments presented in Figures 2 - 7 and Table 1 [ “Endosomal 59 Fe incorporation into heme” ] . ) Measurement of chelator - bound 59 Fe 59 Fe - reticulocytes ( 50 (cid:3) L ) , obtained after experimental manipulations indicated in speciﬁc experiments , were lysed with 200 (cid:3) L cold water , and proteins were precipitated with 1 mL cold 95 % ethanol . The mixture was then spun to yield an ethanol soluble fraction containing 59 Fe bound to low molecular weight chelators ( in the majority of experiments , DPor SIH ) , and an ethanol precipitate fraction containing protein - bound 59 Fe . 22 A control experiment demonstrated that 95 % ethanol precipitated 59 Fe bound to Tf or incorporated into ferritin or hemoglobin , whereas chelator - bound 59 Fe was shown to be ethanol soluble . ( This method was used in experiments presented in Figure 5 . ) The assessment of the utilization of mitochondrial non - heme 59 Fe for heme synthesis Reticulocyte mitochondria were loaded with non - heme 59 Fe by incubating ( 30 minutes ) the cells with INH ( 10 mM ) , an inhibitor of 5 - aminolevulinate synthase , following which the samples were supplemented with 59 Fe - Tf and incubated for an additional 60 minutes . Unbound 59 Fe - Tf was removed by a thorough washing in cold buffer . As compared with control reticulocytes that contained more than 80 % 59 Fe in heme , INH - treated reticulocytes contained less than 10 % of 59 Fe in heme . 23 Following washing and second incubation ( 1 hour ) without the heme synthesis inhibitor , non - heme 59 Fe accumulated in mitochondria is used for the synthesis of heme that contains 60 % or more of cell - associated 59 Fe . 23 All the reagents that were shown to inhibit the incorporation of endosomal - 59 Fe for heme synthesis were also tested for their effect on the use of mitochondrial non - heme 59 Fe for heme synthesis . ( ThismethodwasusedinexperimentspresentedinTable1 , lastcolumn . ) 125 I - Tf uptake and release Reticulocytes were preincubated with tested reagents ( 60 minutes / 4°C ) following which 125 I - Tf ( 2 (cid:3) M ) was added and 125 I - Tf internalization was initiated by warming up at 37°C ; the tested reagents were present during incubation at 37°C . Samples were taken in duplicates at different time intervals and immediately transferred to ice - cold PBS to terminate the Tf internalization . After 3 washes , the cell pellet was resuspended in 400 (cid:3) L 0 . 25 % pronase and incubated on ice for 30 minutes . Following centrifuga - tion , 125 I - Tf radioactivity of reticulocytes ( pronase resistant , ie , internalized 125 I - Tf ) was measured . To examine 125 I - Tf release , reticulocytes were ﬁrst incubated with 125 I - Tf ( 2 (cid:3) M ) at 37°C for 30 minutes . After 3 washes with PBS ( 4°C ) , cells were preincubated with tested reagents in an ice - bath . 125 I - Tf release was initiated by warming up at 37°C in the presence of 56 Fe 2 - Tf ( 2 (cid:3) M ) ; tested reagents were also present during this incubation . Samples were collected in duplicates , immediately transferred into ice - cold PBS and centrifuged to separate cellular 125 I - Tf from 125 I - Tf released into the medium . ( This method was used in experiments presented in Table 1 , ﬁrst 2 columns . ) Data analysis All of the results presented are averages of duplicate data ( variability (cid:4) 3 % ) points from 1 experiment which is representative of at least 4 experiments .

As expected , increasing 37°C incubation time led to increased internalization of radioiron ; by 30 minutes 96 % of the cell - associated 59 Fe could not be displaced by excess extracellu - lar 56 Fe 2 - Tf . Interestingly , the incorporation of internalized 59 Fe into heme occurred very rapidly so that at 2 minutes , 4 minutes , and 15 minutes of incubation 59 Fe - heme represented 42 % , 74 % , and 90 % of internalized 59 Fe , respectively ( Figure 2 ) . It was somewhat surprising to ﬁnd that even after only 1 minute , some 59 Fe was already detected in heme , representing about 40 % of internalized 59 Fe . Since the purpose of this experiment was to establish an incubation time interval at period 3 ( Figure 1 ) that would generate a cohort of 59 Fe 2 - Tf labeled endosomes , the iron from which could be “chased” into heme , we chose this 1 - minute interval for subsequent experiments . Vesicular 59 Fe utilization requires a vacuolar proton - translocating adenosine triphosphatase ( V - ATPase ) proton pump and intact heme synthesis We next examined ( Figure 3 ) whether 59 Fe translocation into heme during period 5 ( “chase” ) required endosomal acidiﬁcation and intact porphyrin synthesis . Figure 3 shows that in control 59 Fe - labeled reticulocytes , the radioactivity of 59 Fe in heme increased from 36 % to about 90 % within 45 to 60 minutes . A speciﬁc V - ATPase inhibitor , baﬁlomycin A1 , 24 almost totally inhibited the use of 59 Fe for heme synthesis during period 5 ( Figure 3A ) . This strongly suggests that at the end of period 3 59 Fe is associated with Tf within endosomes . As expected , SA , a speciﬁc inhibitor of 5 - aminolevulinate dehydratase , 13 the second enzyme of heme synthesis , prevented endosomal - 59 Fe incorporation into heme ( Fig - ure 3B ) . Iron chelators intercept 59 Fe only in metabolically active reticulocytes The ferrous iron chelator , DP , can intercept iron following its release from Tf and mobilize it from endosomes , 14 , 25 whereas the ferric iron chelator , SIH , can readily oxidize ferrous iron 26 and efﬁciently mobilize iron from both endosomes and mitochondria . 19 As expected both DP and SIH promoted 59 Fe release from 59 Fe - labeled reticulocytes and prevented the use of endosomal - 59 Fe for heme synthesis ( Figure 4 ) . Approximately the same fraction of endosomal 59 Fe that is normally used for heme synthesis ( Figure 4 ) can be detected as being bound to the chelators ( a sum of the 59 Fe released from the cells plus the chelator - bound 59 Fe within the cells ; Figure 5 ) . Importantly , the chelators can capture 59 Fe only when they are present during the incubation of the reticulocytes at 37°C . When reticulocytes are incubated without chelators , which are then added solely during cell lysis ( 4°C ) , only a very small fraction of 59 Fe is available for binding by either DP or SIH ( ie , ethanol - soluble 59 Fe ; Figure 5 ) . These experimental results indicate that the chelators can intercept 59 Fe during its translocation from 59 Fe - endosomes to ferrochelatase only in metabolically active reticulocytes . Inhibitors of microﬁlament , but not microtubule , function abrogate the use of endosomal 59 Fe for heme synthesis There is increasing evidence that microﬁlaments and microtubules , and their corresponding motors , are involved not only in endocyto - sis but also in subsequent endosome trafﬁcking . 27 - 33 Hence , the following experiments were designed to examine whether the disruption of microtubule or microﬁlament function affects the use of endosomal 59 Fe for heme synthesis . We found that inhibitors of microtubule function , nocodazole 34 - 36 and taxol 37 , 38 ( not shown ) , when added during period 5 , at concentrations known to inhibit the aforementioned functions , did not block the use of endosomal 59 Fe for heme synthesis . In fact , nocodazole slightly stimulated the incorporation of 59 Fe from endosomes into heme ( see Table 1 ) . A microﬁlament depolymerizer , cytochalasin D , 39 did not block Figure 2 . Internalization of 59 Fe from membrane - associated 59 Fe - Tf and its incorporation into heme . After saturating the membrane TfR with 59 Fe - Tf ( see Figure 1 , the end of period 2 ) , internalization was initiated by incubating cells at 37°C in the presence of 5 - fold excess of 56 Fe - Tf . At the indicated times , samples were collectedandwashed , andmembrane - bound 59 Fe - Tfwasremovedbyincubatingthe cellswith 56 Fe - Tf ( Figure1 , period4 ) .

However , cytochalasin D is able to depolymerize microﬁlaments only when they are in a dynamic state 40 , 41 ; microﬁlaments are extremely stable at the latest stages of erythroid differentiation . 42 Therefore , we examined the effects of inhibitors of microﬁlament motors , myo - sins . We found that the myosin light chain kinase inhibitor WT 43 , 44 inhibited 59 Fe incorporation from 59 Fe - Tf - labeled endosomes into heme ( Figure 6A ) . Similar inhibition was seen ( see Table 1 ) using another myosin light chain kinase inhibitor , ML - 9 . 45 , 46 Moreover , a general myosinATPase inhibitor , BDM 47 , 48 ( see Table 1 ) , as well as a calmodulin antagonist , W - 7 49 , 50 ( Figure 6B ) , also caused signiﬁ - cant inhibition of 59 Fe incorporation from 59 Fe - endosomes into heme . It should be pointed out that the effects of WT and W - 7 were additive ( Figure 6C ) , and the combined presence of ML - 9 , W - 7 , and BDM during period 5 almost completely blocked the utiliza - tion of endosomal - 59 Fe for the synthesis of heme ( Figure 7 ) . Importantly , none of the above listed reagents , except for BDM ( see Table 1 ) , inhibited the use of mitochondrial non - heme 59 Fe for heme synthesis , indicating that these reagents neither interfere with porphyrin biosynthesis nor inhibit ferrochelatase . Additionally , BDM inhibits endosomal 59 Fe utilization more signiﬁcantly than mitochondrial 59 Fe incorporation into heme ( see Table 1 ) , suggest - ing that the former effect is primarily responsible for the effects of BDM shown in Figure 7 . To further elucidate the nature of these reagents’ inhibitory properties , we examined their effects on the uptake and release of 125 I - Tf as well as on the incorporation of 59 Fe from 59 Fe - Tf into reticulocytes and heme ( Table 1 ) . All the agents , except for nocodazole , slowed down Tf cycle and inhibited incorporation of 59 Fe from 59 Fe - Tf into reticulocytes and heme . Nocodazole , somewhat surprisingly , increased the rate of Tf internalization and slightly stimulated cellular uptake of 59 Fe and its incorporation into heme . Discussion In reticulocytes , the delivery of Tf - borne iron to hemoglobin occurs with extremely high efﬁciency since after only a 3 - minute incuba - tion of reticulocytes with 59 Fe 2 - Tf about 80 % of cell - associated 59 Fe can be found in heme . 16 This remarkably effective utilization of iron in erythroid cells can be explained , at least in part , by a speciﬁc targeting of iron toward mitochondria where ferrochelatase inserts Fe 2 (cid:5) into protoporphyrin IX . Although ferritin has been postulated to act as an intermediate for heme synthesis in erythroid cells , several studies failed to show that 59 Fe from 59 Fe - ferritin could be incorporated into hemoglobin 51 ( reviewed in Richardson and Ponka 2 ) . Moreover , erythroleukemia cells overexpressing H - ferritin subunits show signiﬁcantly inhibited synthesis of heme , 52 suggesting that excess ferritin traps intracellular iron and curtails its availability for heme synthesis . As pointed out above , in hemoglobin - synthesizing cells iron seems to be very speciﬁcally channeled to the site where heme is Figure 4 .

One mM ( A ) or 0 . 1 mM SIH ( B ) was included during periods 4 and 5 ( Figure 1 ) . At the indicated intervals ( during period 5 ) , 2 samples were collected : one was used for measurements of 59 Fe radioactivity in heme ( f , DP or SIH ; (cid:2) , control ) , while the other was transferred to 4 mL ice - cold PBS and centrifuged and the 59 Fe radioactivity in the supernatant measured ( F , DP or SIH ; E , control ) . The values are displayed as the percentage of the total cellular 59 Fe as it was after the membrane - associated radioiron was displaced by 56 Fe - Tf ( Figure 1 , end of period 4 ) . Figure 5 .

Earlier work suggested an association of Tf with mitochondria in erythroid cells , 53 - 55 leading to the proposal 1 , 16 that a highly efﬁcient use of Tf - borne iron for heme synthesis may require a direct interaction of endosomes , bearing Fe 2 - Tf , with mitochondria , followed by the transfer of iron through organellar membrane - associated proteins to ferrochelatase . The main purpose of our study was to further investigate this hypothesis . Using an incubation protocol exploiting 59 Fe - Tf and 56 Fe - Tf ( Figure 1 ) and the temperature dependence of endocytosis , we speciﬁcally labeled mouse reticulocyte endosomes with 59 Fe bound to Tf . We demonstrated that a speciﬁc V - ATPase inhibitor , baﬁlo - mycin A1 , almost totally blocked the use of endosomal 59 Fe for heme synthesis ( Figure 3A ) , indicating that this 59 Fe was bound to Tf within the vesicles . The transfer of endosomal 59 Fe into heme was very rapid and required an unrestrained supply of protoporphy - rin IX ( Figure 3B ) . Approximately the same amount of endosome - derived 59 Fe that normally appears in heme ( Figures 3 , 4 ) , can be intercepted by ferrous or ferric chelators when they are added to the 59 Fe - reticulocytes during their incubation at 37°C . Some of the chelator - bound 59 Fe can be released from the cells ( Figure 4 ) while a fraction of 59 Fe - DP or 59 Fe - SIH remains trapped in the reticulo - cytes ( Figure 5 ) . However , very little intracellular 59 Fe can be acquired by the chelators when they are added during lysis at 4°C of 59 Fe - reticulocytes . In other words , at any given time the vast majority of 59 Fe is bound to components that bind 59 Fe with a stronger afﬁnity than DP or SIH . The only exceptions are very short incubation time intervals ( up to 4 minutes ) when 59 Fe is probably just being released from Tf within endosomes ( Figure 5 ) . In the following experiments we examined whether agents that may disturb intracellular trafﬁcking of endosomes inhibit the use of endosomal 59 Fe for heme synthesis . Neither the speciﬁc microtu - bule depolymerizer , nocodazole , nor the microtubule stabilizer , taxol , inhibited Tf and iron uptake by reticulocytes or 59 Fe incorporation from endosomes into heme . This result is in agree - ment with previous observations that microtubule inhibitors do not block Tf endocytosis and iron uptake by reticulocytes . 56 On the contrary , we observed that nocodazole slightly stimulated Tf and iron uptake by reticulocytes ( Table 1 ) . Although the mechanism of this stimulation is unclear , it is pertinent to mention that nocodazole also modestly increased incorporation of endosomal 59 Fe into heme ( Table 1 ) . Myosins , some types of which are present in erythroid cells , 42 , 57 - 59 are molecular motors involved in the transport of vesicles at speciﬁc locations in cells . 60 We showed that myosin light chain kinase inhibitors , WT and ML - 9 , calmodulin antagonist , W - 7 , and a general myosin heavy chain ATPase inhibitor , BDM , inhibited endosomal 59 Fe incorporation into heme ( Figures 6 , 7 ) . WT , which is also an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3 (cid:2) - kinase , 61 was previously shown to inhibit Tf receptor recycling , 62 but it is unknown whether this inhibition is due to WT’s effect on the kinase . The inhibitory effects of WT and W - 7 are additive ( Figure 6C ) , a ﬁnding that suggests different mechanisms of action of these 2 agents . It should be pointed out that calmodulin , a regulator of myosin light chain kinase , was previously shown to play a role in Tf recycling and exocytic Tf release in rat reticulocytes . 63 All these inhibitors also inhibited Tf internalization and release as well as the uptake of iron by reticulocytes and its utilization for heme synthesis ( Table 1 ) . These results strongly suggest that attenuated cycling of Tf is associated with impaired mobility of endosomes within reticulocytes that , in turn , results in an inefﬁcient utilization of iron for heme synthesis .

FE TARGETING TO MITOCHONDRIAIN RETICULOCYTES 373 BLOOD , 1 JANUARY 2005 (cid:1) VOLUME 105 , NUMBER 1 For personal use only . on December 27 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From entered a “freely diffusible” Fe pool in the cytosol , the inhibition of intracellular endosome trafﬁcking would not be expected to interfere with iron transport toward mitochondrial ferrochelatase . The concept that iron bypasses the cytosol would seem to be in conﬂict with studies 11 that attempt to estimate iron concentrations in the cytosolic “labile iron pool” ( LIP ) . However , these measure - ments are based on the use of a chelator , calcein , that can be expected to intercept iron upon its release from endosomes . This conclusion is strongly supported by the observation that iron concentration in the LIP increases up to 10 - fold immediately following the exposure of K562 cells to Fe 2 (cid:5) - Tf . 64 In fact , as we have demonstrated in the current study , virtually all of the chelator accessible iron in reticulocytes , that are not actively directing iron to mitochondria , is probably the small amount ( (cid:4) 5 % at time (cid:6) 45 minutes , Figure 5 ) that has been released from Tf within the vesicle , as opposed to the majority ( about 70 % at time (cid:6) 45 minutes , Figure 5 ) of the cell - associated iron that bound when the chelators are added at 37°C . It is important to note that those studies measuring the LIP with ﬂuorescent chelators , calcein or phen green SK , load cells with these reagents for as many as 30 minutes at 37°C . 11 , 64 , 65 Thus , most of the reported measurements of this compartment may not reﬂect cytoplasmic iron , rather iron that has been captured during its active transfer to more tightly binding ligands , such as ferrochelatase / heme or ferritin . It needs to be also pointed out that the calcein - based LIP measurements were done only with non - erythroid cells . Since this method requires ﬂuores - cence measurements , it may not be appropriate for hemoglobin - synthesizing cells which contain high levels of ﬂuorescent porphyrins . Collectively , these results support the hypothesis that in ery - throid cells a transient mitochondria - endosome interaction may be involved in iron translocation to ferrochelatase . As pointed out in the “Introduction , ” the substrate for the endosomal transporter , Nramp2 / DMT1 , is Fe 2 (cid:5) , the redox form of iron in which it is also translocated across the mitochondrial membrane toward ferroche - latase . 66 These facts make the above hypothesis attractive , since ferrous ions would bypass an oxygen - rich cytosol in hemoglobin - synthesizing cells . In this connection it is pertinent to mention that interactions of organelles in other cell types have been character - ized . Desjardin et al 67 described a contact of endosomes with phagosomes in J - 774 macrophages , and Mannella et al 68 showed that rat liver mitochondria interact with the endoplasmic reticulum . Another study demonstrated the internalization of apo - Tf from the basolateral membrane of an intestinal cell line ( Caco - 2 ) and colocalization of that protein with vesicles containing apical membrane – derived DMT1 , indicating that the transfer of nutri - tional iron to Tf may bypass the enterocyte cytosol . 69 Scott and Eaton 70 showed that trace amounts of “free” iron in combination with cellular reducing equivalents oxidize hemoglo - bin . This report strongly suggests that a pool of free iron is capable of establishing a self - amplifying and self - propagating redox reac - tion with hemoglobin that can eventually lead to red cell destruc - tion . Hence , the chaperonelike function of endosomes may be one of the mechanisms that keeps the concentration of reactive iron at extremely low levels . Moreover , apart from the mitochondrion , it is possible that the endosome may interact with other membranes / organelles to deliver iron to newly synthesized proteins that require iron . 71 The intricate and highly organized structure of the intracellu - lar matrix , 72 together with the extremely rapid incorporation of iron into hemoglobin , argues against freely diffusible and potentially toxic cytosolic iron pool and suggests a more tightly coordinated and efﬁcient mechanism . It is also pertinent to mention that speciﬁc chaperones keep free cellular copper at extremely low levels ; in fact intracellular concentration of free copper is limited to less than 1 free copper ion per cell . 73 Hence , it is tempting to speculate that general principles controlling intracellular trafﬁck - ing of iron and copper , 2 essential but potentially toxic transition metals , are similar .
