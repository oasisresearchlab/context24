However , the neural mechanisms underlying this relationship have not been assessed . Using voxel - based morphometry ( VBM ) and scientific innovation problem solving materials , we investigated the correlation between RC and regional gray matter volume ( rGMV ) in healthy young partici - pants . We found that RC was positively correlated with rGMV in the right superior temporal gyrus ( STG ) and in a cluster in the left medial frontal gyrus ( MFG ) . These results indicate that increased rGMV in the right STG may lead to the ability to overcome misdirection more easily , which may result in better semantic integration of the “certain construction” of heuristic prototypes . Increased rGMV in the left MFG may be associated with forming novel associations and retrieving matched unsolved technical problems from memory . Further analysis revealed that the interaction between critical thinking and rGMV predicted RC in insightful problem solving , and found that higher rGMV was correlated with higher RC in participants with lower cognitive maturity , but not in participants with higher cognitive maturity . These findings suggest that rGMV could interact with cognitive maturity to modulate RC in insightful problem solving . Keywords Representation connection · Heuristic prototype · Scientific problem solving · Critical thinking · Voxel - based morphometry Introduction The first step toward scientific and technical innovations is often a creative insight ( Sternberg and Lubart 1993 ; Dietrich and Kanso 2010 ) . Insightful problem solving has been previously used to study the process of gaining creative insights ( Kaplan and Simon 1990 ) . Throughout history , in real - life insightful problem solving , scientific innovations have frequently appeared when inspired by some heuristic knowledge . For example , Rutherford used a solar system analogy to arrive at an understanding of the atom . In previ - ous experimental studies , heuristic knowledge was found to have an important role in problem representations and gain - ing insights . Based on these studies , the Prototype Heuristic Theory was proposed ( Dickinson 1999 ; Dandan et al . 2013a , b ; Hao et al . 2013 ; Luo et al . 2013 ; Tong et al . 2015 ) . In previous studies , situations used for solving scientific innovation problems were based on contemporary situations in science and engineering that were collected from vari - ous media , such as magazines , television , and the internet . Each situation comprised an unsolved scientific problem , Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article ( https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1007 / s0022 1 - 019 - 05517 - y ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users . * Jiang Qiu qiuj318 @ swu . edu . cn * Qinglin Zhang zhangql @ swu . edu . cn 1 School of Psychology , Northwest Normal University , Lanzhou 730070 , China 2 Key Laboratory of Behavioral and Mental Health of Gansu Province , Lanzhou 730070 , China 3 Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science , Northwest Minzu University , Lanzhou 730070 , China 4 Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies , Peking University , Beijing 100000 , China 5 School of Psychology , Southwest University , Chongqing 400715 , China Experimental Brain Research 1 3 heuristic prototype , and a reference solution ( Ming et al . 2014 ; Yang et al . 2016 ) . For example , in the problem “How to design spacesuits ? ” , the unsolved scientific problem is the following : “Scientists have been trying to find a special material for spacesuits that is hard enough to be able to bear air pressure and can also bend freely in order to perform extra - vehicular activity . How can such material be found ? ” People kept repeatedly trying to solve this problem until the heuristic prototype of the shrimp shell was developed eventually , which is quite hard and can be bent because of its interconnecting ring structure . Scientists were inspired by this related heuristic prototype ( the shrimp shell body ) and finally solved the problem . Regarding the example men - tioned above , the reference solution would be to “imitate the structure of a shrimp shell , developing a ring connection that allows the spacesuit to bear air pressure and bend freely” ( Dandan et al . 2013a , b ; Ming et al . 2014 ) . In the Prototype Heuristic Theory , the term “heuristic prototype” is defined as an object containing the heuris - tic information for solving insight problems despite being superficially and semantically irrelevant to the insight prob - lem ( Cao et al . 2006 ; Ming et al . 2014 ) . Each heuristic pro - totype has a key “feature function” along with a “certain construction . ” In the above - mentioned problem , the “fea - ture function” is that it is adequately hard and can be bent and the “certain construction” is the interconnecting ring structure . To solve the technical problem , one must fulfill the “required function , ” which is the quality of being both hard and bendable ( Yang et al . 2016 ) . Insights regarding an unsolved scientific problem can occur if the key “feature function” contained in the heuristic prototype is suddenly recognized and correctly matched with the required function ( Ming et al . 2014 ) . This process is called representation con - nection ( RC ) , which is core to solving scientific innovation problems and plays an important role in gaining insights ( Zhang and Jiang 2005 ; Zhang et al . 2011 ; Hao et al . 2013 ; Yang et al . 2016 ) . While these studies help us understand the process of insightful problem solving , the heuristic prototype is the simplest and most distinct concept in this literature ( Dan - dan et al . 2013a , b ; Luo et al . 2013 ) . One behavioral study showed that irrelevant information can interfere with the heuristic prototype , and the more irrelevant the information , the stronger the interference and the greater the decrease in the speed of prototype activation ( Zhao and Zhang 2013 ) . The key “certain construction” in a heuristic prototype is theoretically vague and difficult to define in real - life scien - tific insightful problem solving . Therefore , RC should be assessed in relation to insightful problem solving using a highly ecologically valid heuristic prototype with irrelevant information . That is , the irrelevant heuristic prototype should include not only a related heuristic “certain construction” but also unrelated redundant prototype information . Such situations can also be used to understand why some peo - ple are more likely to avoid irrelevant information , extract the key “certain construction” of irrelevant prototypes , and engage in RC . Previous studies have investigated the neural mecha - nisms of insightful problem solving induced by heuristic prototypes using scientific innovation problem situations and functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) ( Hao et al . 2013 ; Luo et al . 2013 ; Tong et al . 2015 ) . Although these task - related neuroimaging studies have contributed to build - ing an understanding of the insightful problem solving pro - cess , considerable research suggests that gray matter ( GM ) structure measured with MRI could predict interindividual variability in a broad range of human behaviors ( Masako et al . 2004 ; Ryota and Geraint 2011 ; Karl and Katrin 2013 ) . In this regard , results from structural imaging studies have not been limited to specific regions engaged in the task dur - ing scanning and can provide information about the neural substrates of human behavior and cognition ( Takeuchi et al . 2012 ; Karl and Katrin 2013 ) . Both functional and structural studies have strengths and drawbacks and , thus , the two methods should complement each other . Until now , no study has assessed the brain regions underlying individual differ - ences using scientific innovation problem situations and structural magnetic resonance imaging ( sMRI ) . Therefore , the use of neuroanatomical tools and highly ecologically valid scientific innovation problem situations may provide a solid foundation for understanding the neural basis of RC in insightful problem solving . Many factors accounts for the relationship between RC and GM structure , critical thinking which had a close con - nection to critical thinking is one of them . Critical thinking is reasonable , reflective thinking associated with deciding what to believe or do ( Ennis 1962 ; Parse 1996 ) . Critical thinking preserves individuals from uncertain information and fosters a questioning and criticism attitude to find truth - fulness ( Yenice 2010 ) . Previous study showed that the use of critical thinking is assumed to result in pharmacy prac - titioners that are better able to solve problems and think as experts ( Miller 2011 ) . Strong critical thinkers display an ability to be open - minded without harboring prejudices toward differing opinions and engaging in systematic ana - lytical thinking to make thoughtful decisions ( Facione 2004 , Msn and Mary Courtney 2010 ) . Critical thinking disposition has been defined as internal motivation or individual habits and tendencies regarding critical thinking ( Facione 2004 ; Stedman et al . 2007 ) . Cultivating a disposition towards CT is an important element in the promotion of critical thinking skills ( Wan et al . 2000 ) . The California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory ( CCTDI ) was designed to assess indi - vidual’s willingness to engage in critical thinking ( Facione 1990 ) . Previous study observed a significant relationship between critical thinking disposition and learning styles , Experimental Brain Research 1 3 results showed that individuals who are good at retrieving and integrating stored information are more likely to be good critical thinkers . Moreover , critical thinking disposition has been found to be associated with imagination , perspective taking , the generation of diverse ideas , originality scores , and the integration and retrieval aspects of memory ( Frie - del et al . 2008 ; Mahmoud 2012 ; Yalç et al . 2013 ; Jeong 2015 ) . Considering the close association between insightful problem solving and critical thinking disposition as well as the differences in cognitive features between those individu - als with higher and lower critical thinking disposition , we hypothesized that critical - thinking disposition may moderate the relationship between gray matter characteristics and RC in insightful problem solving . In this study , our primary focus was to clarify the rela - tionship between RC and the volume of regional GM using sMRI and irrelevant heuristic prototype situations with high ecological validity to better understand the role of RC in insightful problem solving . The second aim of our study was to examine whether critical thinking moderates the relation - ship between RC in insightful problem solving and regional gray matter volume ( rGMV ) . The studies mentioned above indicate that the RC cog - nitive process , a core process for problem solving , might involve the following processes : functional feature process - ing , heuristic information integration , and the formation of novel associations ( Bowden et al . 2005 ; Zhen – Zhen 2008 ; Hao et al . 2013 ; Ming et al . 2014 ) . Individuals with high levels of insightful problem solving are better at semantic integration and forming novel associations ( Qiu et al . 2010 ; Tian et al . 2011 ; Dandan et al . 2013a , b ; Hao et al . 2013 ; Luo et al . 2013a , b ; Tong et al . 2015 ) . Previous studies also suggest that critical thinking disposition were significantly negatively correlated with total GM volumes of the bilateral temporal pole and bilateral parahippocampal regions , which are involved in memory retrieval and information integra - tion ( Yao et al . 2017 ) . These characteristics are also impor - tant factors for problem solving ( Parr et al . 2004 ; Yalç et al . 2013 ) . We hypothesized that ( 1 ) RC may be associated with differences in rGMV in the lingual gyrus , precuneus , mid - dle / medial frontal gyrus ( MFG ) , and middle / superior tem - poral gyrus ; and that ( 2 ) the relationship between rGMV and RC in insightful problem solving may be moderated by critical thinking , correlations may have different tendency among higher and lower critical thinking disposition . Methods Participants A total of 119 individuals ( 67 women , mean age = 19 . 78 years , SD = 1 . 38 ; 52 men , mean age = 20 . 01 years , SD = 1 . 08 ) participated in the study as a part of our ongoing project to investigate the associations among brain imaging data , creativity , and mental health ( Chen et al . 2014 ; Wei et al . 2014 ) . Participants were undergraduate or postgradu - ate students in China . They were recruited through bulletin board advertisements or were introduced by individuals who had participated in previous studies at our laboratory . None of the participants had visual difficulties , substance abuse disorders , or a history of neurological or psychiatric ill - nesses . All participants gave their written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki ( 1991 ) . The institutional ethics committee of the Brain Imaging Center Institutional Review Board approved the study protocol . Five participants were excluded because of incomplete data in the California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory ( CCTDI ) . Therefore , 114 participants ( 66 women , mean age = 19 . 67 years , SD = 1 . 05 years ; 48 men , mean age = 20 . 04 years , SD = 1 . 09 years ) were included in the final analyses . Assessments and measures Scientific innovation problem solving situations Experimental situations were selected from the “Scientific Innovation Problems Database” ( Yang et al . 2016 ) , which has been utilized in previous fMRI research in our labora - tory ( Qiu et al . 2010 ; Dandan et al . 2013a , b ; Hao et al . 2013 ; Luo et al . 2013a , b ) . Although scientists have already solved these problems in real life , inexperienced participants can rarely solve them without a heuristic prototype . Thus , a prototype - inspired solution would be novel for such partici - pants . Because the present study included not only related heuristic prototypes but also three unrelated redundant sen - tences in the heuristic prototype condition , it is more realis - tic than previous studies . Procedure of the experiment The present study utilized the multiple - by - multiple problem - learning prototype testing paradigm . Nine pairs of technical problems and heuristic prototypes with unrelated redundant sentences were selected ( see Appendix 1 in Supplementary material ) . To better imitate real - life scientific innovation problem solving , subjects were asked to first study the nine problems and then learn the nine prototypes . The experimen - tal procedure is shown in Fig . 1 . Problem‑learning phase During the problem - learning phase , each trial was initi - ated by presenting a “ + ” sign in the center of the screen for 1 s . Subsequently , nine unsolved scientific problems were presented randomly in the center of the screen , one Experimental Brain Research 1 3 at a time , each one shown for 40 s . All participants were asked whether they knew the problem that had been pre - sented before the experiment . Participants were instructed to press the “F” key if they were familiar with the scientific problem or the “J” key if it was unknown to them . After the key was pressed , the next problem was presented . Heuristic prototype phase During the prototype testing phase , each trial was also ini - tiated by presenting a “ + ” sign in the center of the screen for 1 s . Afterward , nine heuristic prototypes with unrelated redundant sentences were presented randomly in the center of the screen , one at a time , for at most 60 s each . Partici - pants were instructed to try to consider “which scientific problem among the nine presented in the last stage is the current prototype helpful for solving” and make a corre - sponding response based on the heuristic prototype . They pressed the “F” key if they associated the presented heu - ristic prototype with the corresponding scientific problem in the last stage . After pressing the key , the heuristic proto - type would disappear , and a blank screen was presented for at most 3 min . Participants were instructed to write down the problem that they had thought of or draw “a circle , ” if they had not yet obtained the corresponding answer when the heuristic prototype was presented , on the answer sheet according to the order of the prototypes presented . After they had finished writing , participants were asked to press the “blank” key to go to the next prototype . Scoring formula Answers were scored as “0” or “1 . ” If participants thought of the corresponding problem , a score of “1” was given , and a score of “0” was given if they had not thought about the corresponding problem . The RC score was calculated by summing the number of responses which were scored 1 in the heuristic prototype phase as well as were pressed the “J” key in problem - learning phase . Assessment of critical thinking disposition The self - reported California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory ( CCTDI ) was used to assess critical thinking disposition ( Facione 1990 ) . The CCTDI has demonstrated itself to be formative and useful in research ( Duncan - Hewitt 1996 ; Wan et al . 2000 ) . It assesses seven attributes related to the development and application of critical thinking skills : disposition toward truth - seeking or bias ; open - mindedness or intolerance ; anticipating possible consequences or being unaware of them ; proceeding in a systematic or unsystematic way ; being confident in or mistrustful of one’s own reason - ing ability ; being inquisitive or resistant to learning ; and mature and nuanced judgment or rigid simplistic thinking . The present study utilized the CCTDI - CV , which contains revised items that are specific to the Chinese culture , with 16 items related to hypothetical situations found in Chinese cultural norms ( e . g . , the value of modesty as a virtue ) . The CCTDI - CV contains 70 items and each subscale has 10 items . It uses a Likert - type scale ranging from “strongly Fig . 1 Task sequence of the experiment A Problem learning stage B Prototype testing stage Heuristic Prototype 1s 60s 3m Fixation Blank Screen 9 trials Fixation 1s 40s 2s Blank Screen Scientific Problem 9 trials Experimental Brain Research 1 3 disagree” to “strongly agree” ( 1 – 6 points ) . In previous stud - ies , its content validity and Cronbach’s alpha coefficients have been 0 . 89 ( Peng et al . 2004 ) and 0 . 88 ( Yao et al . 2017 ) , respectively . Assessment of psychometric measures of general intelligence To exclude the possibility that any significant correlation between GMV and RC in insightful problem solving could be caused by an indirect association between GMV and general intelligence ( Takeuchi et al . 2011 , 2014 ) , the Com - bined Raven’s Test ( CRT ; revised by the Psychology Depart - ment of East China Normal University in 1994 ) , which is the Chinese version of this intelligence test ( Wang 2007 ) , was used in the current study . The CRT consists of Raven’s Colored Progressive Matrices and Raven’s Standard Pro - gressive Matrices ( sets C , D , and E ) , which can be used for individuals aged between 5 and 75 years , and contains six sets of 12 nonverbal items . Each item comprises a matrix with a missing element for which participants must select the best answer from six or eight alternatives . The internal consistency coefficient of the CRT is 0 . 93 , and the coeffi - cient value for its convergent validity ( correlation between the CRT and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale ) is 0 . 56 , and 0 . 57 for criterion - related validity ( correlation between the CRT and scholastic achievement ) ( Wang 2007 ) . MRI data acquisition All MRI data were acquired using a 3T Siemens Trio MRI scanner ( Siemens Medical , Erlangen , Germany ) . High - resolution T1 - weighted anatomical images were acquired using a magnetization - prepared rapid gradient echo ( MP - RAGE ) sequence : repetition time ( TR ) = 1900 ms ; echo time ( TE ) = 2 . 52 ms ; inversion time ( TI ) = 900 ms ; flip angle = 9 ° ; resolution matrix = 256 × 256 ; slices = 176 ; thickness = 1 . 0 mm ; and voxel size = 1mm × 1mm × 1 mm . Voxel‑based morphometry ( VBM ) The associations between rGMV structures and various cognitive abilities can identify the brain regions associated with specific cognitive characteristics ( Haier et al . 2004 ; Takeuchi et al . 2011 ) . Thus , structural imaging can provide information on the neural mechanisms of RC in insightful problem solving . Statistical Parametric Mapping software ( SPM ) 8 implemented in Matlab 7 . 8 ( Math Works Inc . , Natick , MA , USA ) was applied for the processing of MRI data ( Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology , Lon - don , UK ; http : / / www . fil . ion . ucl . ac / spm ) . The procedure consisted of five steps . First , each MR image was displayed in SPM8 to check for scanner artifacts or gross anatomical abnormalities . Second , for better registration , the reorienta - tion of the images was manually set to the anterior commis - sure . Third , the images were segmented into gray matter ( GM ) , white matter ( WM ) , and cerebrospinal fluid using the new segmentation . Fourth , diffeomorphic anatomical registration was performed through exponentiated lie alge - bra ( DARTEL ) in SPM8 for registration , normalization , and modulation , which is an additional step based on the change of variables theorem and allows the evaluation of gray mat - ter or white matter volume ( van Tol et al . 2010 ) , leaving the images in DARTEL space . A DARTEL template is created based on the deformation fields produced during the seg - mentation procedure ; all individual deformation fields were registered to this template ( Ashburner 2007 ; Hutton et al . 2009 ) . To ensure that regional differences in the absolute amount of GM were conserved , we modulated the image intensity of each voxel by the Jacobian determinants using linear transformations . Then , registered images were trans - formed to Montreal Neurological Institute ( MNI ) space . Last , all images were smoothened with a Gaussian kernel of 10 - mm full - width at half - maximum to increase their sig - nal to noise ratio . Statistical analysis GM images were pre - processed using SPM8 . To avoid edge effects around the borders between GM and WM , we included only those voxels that showed GM of > 0 . 2 in rGMV analyses . Multiple linear regression was used to test the relationship between RC in insightful problem solving and rGMV . In whole - brain multiple regression analyses , the RC score was used as the variable of interest , whereas age , gender , IQ , and global GM volumes were included in the design matrix as nuisance covariates of no interest . For all analyses , the cluster - level significance was set at P < 0 . 05 , corrected using a non - stationary cluster correction ( Hayasaka et al . 2004 ) with an underlying voxel significance level of P < 0 . 001 . Non - stationary cluster size tests can be safely applied to data that are known to be non - stationary ( e . g . , not uniformly smooth ) , such as VBM data ( Hayasaka et al . 2004 ; Silver et al . 2011 ; Takeuchi et al . 2014 ) . Moderation analysis A moderator variable is a variable that affects the direction and / or strength of the relationship between an independ - ent variable and a dependent variable . The present study used the MODPROBE macro for SPSS to examine under which conditions “X” had a stronger / weaker ( positive / nega - tive ) association with or effect on “Y” through moderation analyses ( Hayes and Matthes 2009 ) . We also investigated whether critical thinking disposition affected the relation - ship between rGMV and RC using the Johnson – Neyman Experimental Brain Research 1 3 technique in the SPSS MODPROBE macro ( Hayes and Matthes 2009 ) . In a regression analysis conducted in SPSS Statistics 16 ( http : / / www . spss . com ) , the total and subscale scores of critical thinking disposition were entered as mod - erator variables separately , RC score as dependent variable , and rGMV as focal predictor . These methods have been suc - cessfully utilized in previous studies ( Nikolova et al . 2012 ; Wei et al . 2015 ; Yao et al . 2017 ) . Results Sample descriptive statistics Table 1 shows the mean and SD by age , CRT scores , and RC scores in insightful problem solving for both genders . There were no significant differences in RC scores between men and women . Table 2 lists the characteristics related to RC and cognitive maturity level of the total sample . As indicated in Table 2 , RC scores did not significantly correlate with cognitive maturity ( a dimension of critical thinking ) . VBM analysis After controlling for age , gender , IQ , and global GM vol - ume , RC scores in insightful problem solving were found to be positively correlated with rGMV in the right anterior STG and a cluster of the left MFG ( see Fig . 2 ) . These results are shown in Table 3 . Moderation analysis Based on the previous studies , we hypothesized that indi - vidual differences in critical thinking and its dimensions would moderate the relationship between rGMV and RC in insightful problem solving . Results indicated a significant interaction between cognitive maturity and STG volume ( ∆ R 2 = 0 . 061 , b = − 1 . 50 , t = − 2 . 99 , P = 0 . 0034 ) , such that higher RC was associated with greater STG volume among participants with relatively low cognitive maturity ( 80 . 7 % of participants , n = 92 ) , but not among those with higher cognitive maturity ( remaining 19 . 3 % of participants , n = 22 ) . There was a similar significant interaction between MFG volume and cognitive maturity ( ΔR 2 = 0 . 041 , b = − 1 . 36 , t = − 2 . 36 , P = 0 . 019 ) , such that higher RC was associated with higher MFG volume among participants with lower cogni - tive maturity ( 80 . 7 % of participants , n = 92 ) but not among those with higher cognitive maturity ( remaining 19 . 3 % of participants , n = 22 ) . These results are shown in Fig . 3 . Discussion The present study revealed that RC was primarily associated with a significant increase in a cluster that included areas of the right anterior STG and left MFG . Consistent with our hypothesis , we further found that cognitive maturity moder - ates the relationship between rGMV and RC . Specifically , we found that higher rGMV was correlated with higher RC in participants with lower cognitive maturity , but not in those with higher cognitive maturity . Increased volume in the right anterior STG was positively associated with RC in insightful problem solving . Accumu - lating evidence suggests that bilateral anterior STG / MTG is associated with sentence integration and complex discourse ( Stowe et al . 1999 ; Friederici et al . 2003 ; Grabowski et al . 2010 ) , Semantic integration operates on selected concepts to construct complex representations ( Jung - Beeman 2005 ) . Moreover , Kounios and colleagues found greater neural activity in bilateral MTG / STG when participants performed compound remote associate problems and suggested that this was related to semantic activation ( Jung - Beeman et al .

RC scores are associated with an increased volume in the right STG and left MFG in participants with relatively lower ( yellow line ) score of CM . The “ X ” axis represents the decentralization of gray matter volume in the right STG or left MFG . The “ Y ” axis represents the decentralization of RC scores Experimental Brain Research 1 3 2004 ; Kounios et al . 2006 ) . Moreover , compared to the left STG , the right anterior STG is more sensitive to distant or novel semantic relations and maintains a distant and unu - sual semantic activation of a broader semantic field ( Meyer et al . 2000 ; Jung - Beeman et al . 2004 ) . These semantic fields include information that initially seems irrelevant but later proves to be important ( Chiarello et al . 2003 ; Jung - Beeman 2005 ) . As mentioned above , the heuristic prototype was the object containing the heuristic information for solving insight problems , despite being superficially and semanti - cally irrelevant to these problems . Accordingly , people with higher rGMV in the right STG may integrate an irrelevant heuristic prototype and subsequently activate the key “fea - ture function” along with a “certain construction” of this prototype more successfully . Semantic activation of the “cer - tain construction” of heuristic prototypes may help in build - ing associations with the “required function” in unsolved technical problems . We also observed that RC in insightful problem solv - ing was positively associated with GMV in the left MFG regions . Previous studies have revealed that the MFG is required for processing novel and creative information and generating unusual verbs ( Seger et al . 2000 ; Mashal et al . 2007 ) . In addition , Rugg and colleagues ( 1998 ) indi - cated that the MFG is involved in “spontaneous conscious effort” to suppress irrelevant thoughts ( Rugg et al . 1998 ) . In our study , the heuristic prototype always contained some redundant information , and participants needed to suppress irrelevant redundant information to connect the unsolved scientific problem and heuristic prototype correctly , a pro - cess similar to forming novel associations between unre - lated words . Therefore , we suggest that increased GMV in this area may be associated with an increased ability for suppressing irrelevant thoughts and , thereby , leading to the successful formation of novel associations . Furthermore , the association between the left MFG and problem solving scores can be understood in terms of the role of information manipulation . The left MFG plays a role in manipulating the information actively maintained in the working memory , which may perform a decisive role in gaining insights ( Cairo et al . 2004 ; Lang et al . 2006 ) . In parallel , Montaldi and colleagues ( 2002 ) found that the MFG was involved in generating scenarios that could lead to increased candidate semantic linkages in the working memory , promoting relational associations among seman - tic concepts ( Montaldi et al . 2002 ) . As mentioned above , the manipulation of information in the working memory could improve the semantic associations among heuristic prototypes and relevant scientific problems . Thus , increased GMV in the MFG may be associated with better informa - tion manipulation , which may induce the formation of novel associations , as well as selecting and retrieving matched unsolved technical problems from the memory . Interestingly , the present study revealed that the relation - ship between GMV and individual RC in insightful prob - lem solving was moderated by cognitive maturity , which is a subscale of critical thinking disposition . The cognitive maturity subscale targets the disposition to be judicious in one’s decision - making . In this regard , higher cognitive maturity has been associated with a greater likelihood of thinking that problems are necessarily ill - structured and that situations admit more than one plausible option in the context of approaching problems , inquiry , and decision - making ( Facione et al . 1994 ) . A previous study showed that cognitive maturity is associated with a wide range of brain regions in the lateral and medial frontal , striatal , and pari - etotemporal regions ( Rubia 2013 ) . Participants with lower levels of cognitive maturity were less likely to obtain high problem - solving scores ( Macpherson 2002 ) . These findings may indicate that cognitive maturity is moderately correlated with problem solving . In addition , individuals with higher cognitive maturity levels are also likely to make judgments based on standards , contexts , and evidence that preclude cer - tainty , and such individuals may anticipate situations that require reasoning and have confidence in their reasoning ability ( Facione et al . 1994 ; Stedman et al . 2007 ) . In the pre - sent study , participants needed to associate the prototype and problem in a novel manner to solve the problem correctly . In this regard , relying on strict standards for decision - making may lead to mental impasse and , consequently , frustration . Based on the present findings , we propose that rGMV inter - acts with cognitive maturity to modulate RC in insightful problem solving . In summary , the present study has observed that RC is intimately associated with individual differences in a clus - ter that included areas of the right aSTG and left MFG . Moreover , the relationship between RC and the right aSTG and left MFG volume are moderated by cognitive maturity . Higher rGMV is correlated with higher RC in participants with lower cognitive maturity , but not in participants with higher cognitive maturity , indicating the potential involve - ment of cognitive maturity in the relationship between RC and brain morphology . The present findings represent an additional step toward understanding the neurobiology of RC in insightful problem solving . Strengths and limitations To our knowledge , this is the first study to use a structural approach ( i . e . , rGMV ) to examine the neural correlates of RC and the association between critical thinking , brain structure , and individual RC in insightful problem solving . Moreover , most previous studies on insight have used arti - ficial problems , while the scientific problem - solving situa - tions in the present study were related to real - life situations , which had high ecological validity . Accordingly , results are Experimental Brain Research 1 3 more likely to reflect the neural basis of real - world scien - tific problem solving . Although the present study benefited from the sMRI technique that is considered a highly reli - able , reproducible , and effective approach , the conclusions regarding the relationship between critical thinking , brain structure , and individual RC in insightful problem solving remain reserved . Future studies should not only analyze additional structural aspects , such as cortical folding and thickness but also examine the functional brain mechanisms of RC , such as low - frequency oscillations . Additional longi - tudinal or intervention studies in larger or different samples are required to confirm these results .
