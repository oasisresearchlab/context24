The ﬁber matrix is considered as an external ﬁeld to reconﬁgure a nanoparticle assembly . We ﬁnd that the heating process tunes particle - particle and ﬁber - particle interactions , which alter adsorption of nanoparticles on ﬁber sur - faces or clustering in pore spaces . Thus , it is possible to control the nanoparticle self - assembly by laser illumination . Gold nanoparticles strongly absorb radiations and eﬃciently dissipate absorbed energy into heat . By solving the heat transfer equation associated with an eﬀective medium approxi - mation , we calculate the spatial temperature rise . Remarkably , our theoretical results quantitatively agree with prior experiments . This indicates that we can ignore plasmonic coupling eﬀects induced by particle clustering . Eﬀects of the laser spot size and intensity on the photothermal heating are also discussed . I . INTRODUCTION Plasmonic metamaterials have attracted a signiﬁcant attention for a wide range of applications , such as en - ergy harvesting , highly sensitive sensors , high - resolution imaging , and photodetectors [ 1 – 4 ] . When metal nanos - tructures are fabricated on ﬂexible and elastomeric sub - strates or embedded in polymers or ﬁbers , the metamate - rials become stretchable , ﬂexible and wearable to surpass limitations of their rigid counterparts , particularly for the biomedical applications [ 2 – 5 ] . One of the most common polymers used for these metamtaterials is polydimethyl - siloxane ( PDMS ) [ 2 – 4 ] . The low surface energy of PDMS generates a hydrophobic surface . Recently , an ultra - ﬂexible plasmonic metamaterial ﬁlm is fabricated by mixing gold nanoparticles ( AuNPs ) and aramid nanoﬁbers [ 5 ] to generate broadband optical ab - sorbers with durable mechanical strength . In this meta - material , the aramid nanoﬁbers have strong mechanical strength with a high ﬂexibility . While localized sur - face plasmon resonances of gold nanoparticles enhance electromagnetic ﬁelds around the nanostructures , absorb light energy and eﬀectively dissipate it into heat when il - luminated . Thus , these ﬂexible metamaterials become multifunctional materials for a wide range of applica - tions . However , the photothermal heating increases tem - perature of the metamaterials , and possibly aﬀects the clustering of nanoparticles and structurally rearranges them . Here , several questions arise : Does the nanopar - ticle assembly have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the photother - mal heating ? Does the plasmonic coupling matter ? ∗ Electronic address : anh . phanduc @ phenikaa - uni . edu . vn Can existing theoretical approaches describe photother - mal responses without introducing new physics ? The mechanisms have not been comprehensively reported so for . Theoretical insights into microstructures of ﬁber - nanoparticle composites would pave the way for applica - tions in various areas , such as drug delivery [ 6 ] , neuro - morphic transistor [ 7 ] , direct ink writing [ 8 ] , and hyper - stretchable nanocomposite [ 9 ] . The light - induced temperature increase has been the - oretically investigated in various systems . Neumann and her coworkers have simpliﬁed the heat diﬀusion equation to describe qualitatively the heating process and explain how air bubbles around photothermal agents are formed in water [ 10 ] . Sousa - Castillo et . al have determined thermal gradients of a gold nanocapsule deposited on a glass substrate under simulated solar irradiation [ 11 ] by ﬁnite element analysis . Recently , we have proposed new models [ 12 , 13 ] to calculate time - dependent temperature distributions of aqueous solutions of plasmonic nanos - tructure solutions under solar irradiation . We treat this system as a homogeneous single layer system and cap - ture the collective heating of the nanoparticles for a wide range of particle densities . In the year of 2020 , these ap - proaches have been developed to study the thermal gra - dients of multilayered systems such as graphene metama - terials [ 14 ] and ﬂoating / hanging PANi fabrics [ 15 ] . Nu - merical results in Ref . [ 12 – 15 ] are in quantitative accor - dance with experiments . However , photothermal eﬀects in nanoparticle - ﬁber composites have not been studied yet . The presence of ﬁber network introduces conﬁne - ment eﬀects on nanoparticles and possibly shortens the separation distance among them . Thus , strong plasmonic coupling between plasmonic nanoparticles can occur . In addition , while the distribution of nanoparticles in di - lute solutions remains unchanged during the heating pro - a r X i v : 201 1 . 05695v1 [ c ond - m a t . m e s - h a ll ] 11 N ov 2020 2 cess , the thermal - induced reorganization of particles in nanoparticle - ﬁber composites is complicated . In this work , we use the statistical mechanics the - ory to study the equilibrium structure and collective light heating of gold nanoparticles dispersed in a disor - der nanoﬁber network using the polymer reference in - teraction site model ( PRISM ) integral equation theory . This composite is fabricated as an ultra - ﬂexible plas - monic metamaterial in Ref . [ 5 ] . We determine contri - bution of particle - particle and ﬁber - particle interactions , and their length scales to the equilibrium isotropic struc - ture . Our approach is useful for explaining other similar experimental systems such as nanoparticle - protein super - lattice wires [ 16 ] . These interactions can be tuned by laser heating under laser illumination . By using eﬀective medium approximation , we can calculate spatial temper - ature increase . Our calculations are quantitatively close to experimental results in Ref . [ 5 ] . We discuss eﬀects of the nanoparticle density , laser spot , and laser intensity on on the heating process . II . THEORY AND MODEL A . Cooperative nanoparticle self - assembly We present a theoretical model for the binary mix - ture of gold nanoparticles ( p ) dispersed in a randomly distributed nanoﬁber ( f ) network in Ref . [ 5 ] at the in - teraction site level . Each ﬁber is modeled as a freely jointed chain ( FJC [ 17 ] ) of N segments or interaction sites with a site diameter ( the width of ﬁber ) d and a rigid bond length l = 4 d / 3 . The persistence length of 4 / 3 is a common value used for ﬂexible polymers [ 18 ] . Since hydrogen bonds in the ﬁber network are signiﬁ - cantly weakened during fabrication process , we assume that a ﬁber site interacts with other ﬁber sites via a hard - core potential model . A gold nanoparticle has an inter - action site with a diameter D . The interaction between nanoparticles are described by a short - range interaction with a hard - core repulsion , i . e . u pp ( r ) = − ε pp e − ( r − D ) / δ . The interaction between nanoparticles and ﬁbers are also described in the same manner , but a diﬀerent form , i . e . u fp ( r ) = − ε fp e − ( r − ( D + d ) / 2 ) / δ . Here , ε pp ( ε fp ) is an interaction strength between nanoparticles ( between nanoparticles and ﬁbers ) . δ is the parameter for spatial extent of the interaction . One can tune ε pp and ε fp via optical techniques [ 19 ] , while the spatial range depends on chemical details of systems . According to the fabrication in Ref . [ 5 ] , the diameter of AuNPs is D = 0 . 75 d = 58 nm , the pore ( mesh ) size is ξ ≈ 3 . 23 D , and N = 20 , and the particle packing fraction Φ p = 10 − 3 corresponds to the 5 . 7 wt % Au content . The pore size is smaller than the length of ﬁber to construct network . The pore size of the network is theoretically estimated by [ 20 ] ξ ≈ (cid:18) 3 πd 2 4Φ (cid:19) 1 / 2 , ( 1 ) where Φ is a packing fraction of the ﬁber matrix . To obtain ξ ≈ 3 . 23 D , we have Φ = 0 . 4 . We compute site - site pair correlation functions for ob - jects using the PRISM theory [ 21 ] , or solving numeri - cally Ornstein - Zernike ( OZ ) equations [ 21 , 22 ] . In Fourier space , the matrix site - site generalized Ornstein - Zernike equations is given by h ij ( k ) = ω i ( k ) (cid:34) C ij ( k ) ω j ( k ) + (cid:88) l C il ( k ) (cid:37) l h lj ( k ) (cid:35) , ( 2 ) where k is wavevector , h ij ( r ) = g ij ( r ) − 1 , g ij ( r ) is the site - site radial distribution function between species i and j , and C ij ( r ) is the direct correlation function , (cid:37) i is the site number density of species i , and ω j ( k ) is the single molecule structure factor of species j . For convenience , subscript ” p ” indicates particles and ” f ” indicates ﬁbers . The radial distribution functions quantify the probability of a tagged particle to ﬁnd another particle at distance r . For gold particles , ω p ( k ) = 1 . Meanwhile , the molecule structure factor of FJC polymer is [ 18 ] ω f ( k ) = 1 ( 1 − f ) 2 (cid:20) 1 − f 2 − 2 f N + 2 f N + 1 N (cid:21) , ( 3 ) where f = sin ( 4 kd / 3 ) / ( 4 kd / 3 ) . To solve Eq . ( 2 ) , we apply the Percus - Yevick ( PY ) closure [ 21 , 22 ] to the standard ﬁber - ﬁber and ﬁber - nanoparticle real space correlations . The site - site PY approximation for correlations inside species is zero . For outside species , this is C ij ( r ) = (cid:16) 1 − e u ij ( r ) / k B T (cid:17) g ij ( r ) , ( 4 ) where k B is the Boltzmann constant and T is the ambient temperature . The closure for nanoparticle - nanoparticle correlation is the hypernetted - chain ( HNC ) closure [ 21 , 22 ] , which is C pp ( r ) = h pp ( r ) − ln g pp ( r ) − u pp ( r ) k B T . ( 5 ) Now , one can employ the Picard or a Newton - Raphson algorithm [ 22 ] to numerically solve Eqs . ( 2 ) - ( 5 ) to obtain the radial distribution functions and structure factors . B . Photo - thermal heating Although pristine aramid nanoﬁbers has a relatively low optical absorption ( ∼ 20 % ) , this absorption is sig - niﬁcantly enhanced by embedding gold nanoparticles . 3 It was experimentally proved that the AuNPs - nanoﬁber composite absorbs nearly 100 % of incident light in the wavelength range from 400 nm to 2000 nm when Φ p ≥ 2 . 3 × 10 − 3 [ 5 ] . The absorbed energy thermally dis - sipates into the system , raises temperature , and reduces particle - particle and ﬁber - particle interactions . Under broadband laser irradiation , the spatial temper - ature gradient is analytically obtained by solving a heat energy balance equation of a slab . The temperature rise at coordinate ( x , y , z ) [ 12 , 23 ] is ∆ T ( x , y , z , t ) = I ( 1 − R ) α 2 ρ m c m (cid:90) t 0 exp (cid:18) − β 2 ( x 2 + y 2 ) 1 + 4 β 2 κt (cid:48) (cid:19) e α 2 κt (cid:48) 1 + 4 β 2 κt (cid:48) (cid:20) e − αz erfc (cid:18) 2 ακt (cid:48) − z 2 √ κt (cid:48) (cid:19) + e αz erfc (cid:18) 2 ακt (cid:48) + z 2 √ κt (cid:48) (cid:19)(cid:21) dt (cid:48) , ( 6 ) where xy plane is in - plane and z is the depth direc - tion . I is the laser intensity , β is the inverse of the laser spot radius , and R is the reﬂectivity . Since the ultra - ﬂexible metamaterial has strong anti - reﬂection , R ≈ 0 . κ = K m / ( ρ m c m ) is the thermal diﬀusivity , K m is the thermal conductivity , ρ m is the mass density , c m is the speciﬁc heat , and α is the absorption coeﬃcient of the metamaterial . To compare theoretical calculations with photo - thermal characterizations in Ref . [ 5 ] , we per - form with an incident beam having diameter of 4 mm , Φ p = 2 . 3 × 10 − 3 , and I = 30 . 4 mW / mm 2 . According to eﬀective medium approximations [ 24 , 25 ] , an eﬀective dielectric function of the metamaterials is (cid:15) eff = (cid:15) f + Φ p (cid:15) p , here (cid:15) f and (cid:15) f being the dielectric func - tion of the aramid ﬁber [ 5 ] and gold nanoparticles [ 26 ] , re - spectively . We assume that the presence of nanoparticles does not change the packing fraction and macroscopic structure of the aramid ﬁber . Gold nanoparticles simply ﬁll in the pore space . From this , one can determine the absorption coeﬃcient by α = 4 π λ Im (cid:0) √ (cid:15) eff (cid:1) = 4 π λ Im (cid:16)(cid:112) (cid:15) f + Φ p (cid:15) p (cid:17) , ( 7 ) where λ is the wavelength of incident light . The thermal conductivity , mass density , and speciﬁc heat of the metamataterial can be approximately calcu - lated using eﬀective medium approximations [ 24 , 25 , 27 ] K m = K f + Φ p K p , ρ m = ρ f + Φ p ρ p , c m = c f + Φ p c p , ( 8 ) where the subscript f and p denote to the correspond - ing properties of the pure aramid ﬁber network and gold nanoparticles , respectively . Here , K f = 0 . 048 Wm – 1 K – 1 [ 5 ] , ρ f = 1440 kg / m 3 [ 28 ] , ρ p = 19320 kg / m 3 , c f = 1420 J / kg 0 C [ 28 ] , and c p = 129 J / kg 0 C . The lattice ther - mal conductivity depends on the particle size since the phonon scattering is driven by ﬁnite - size and boundary eﬀects [ 29 , 30 ] . A previous study [ 27 ] reveals that the thermal conductivity of a plasmonic nanoparticle of ra - dius 58 nm is reduced by that of its bulk counterpart . Thus , we use K p = 115 Wm – 1 K – 1 in this work . III . RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS A . Hard sphere nanoparticles in the interacting ﬁber network Figure 1a shows particle - particle and ﬁber - particle ra - dial distribution functions for nanoparticles dispersed in a ﬁber network with the moderate repulsion of ε fp = − 0 . 5 k B T and ε pp = 0 ( hard - sphere repulsion ) . A single peak of g pp ( r ) and g fp ( r ) indicates localization of parti - cles in the small pore space . Meanwhile , since the maxi - mum of g fp ( r ) is smaller than 1 . 8 , several particles form a very dilute monolayer onﬁbers . The deduced static mi - crostructure is schematically depicted in Fig . 1b . The particle localization is strongly driven by a spatial range of interfacial forces . As seen in Fig . 1a , g pp ( r ) increases with a growth of δ . One observes a tighter localization with the increase of the range of repulsion . This interacting length scale is tunable by varying a salt concentration . According to the Debye - H¨uckel theory [ 31 ] , one has 1 δ = (cid:115) 2 z 2 e 2 n ε r ε 0 k B T , ( 9 ) where ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity , ε r is the medium permittivity , and z and n are the ionic valence and the ion concentration in solution , respectively . Equation ( 9 ) indicates that the increase of salt screens particle - ﬁber repulsive interactions . In the absence of ﬁber network or in the large pore - size system , the state of hard - sphere ﬂuids becomes localized as Φ p ≥ 0 . 432 [ 22 ] . However , our results exhibit an emergence of the local - ized state at Φ p = 10 − 3 in the presence of a small pore size network . The behavior reveals eﬀects of geometrical constraints on forming the glass - like structure . The local - ization of particles are stronger at low salt concentrations and weaker ( particles start delocalized ) at large salt con - centrations . These calculations are completely consistent with experiments in Ref . [ 16 ] . Although the prior work [ 16 ] investigates the assembly of gold nanoparticles and anionic tobacco mosaic virus nanorods , parameters for interactions , density , and sizes for PRISM calculations are relatively similar . 4 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 4 8 12 16 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 . 0 0 . 6 1 . 2 1 . 8 g pp ( r ) r / d  = 0 . 25d  = 0 . 50d  = 1 . 0d  P = 10 - 3  fp = - 0 . 5k B T ( a ) g f p ( r ) r / d ( b ) ε fp = − 0 . 5k B T ξ = 3 . 23D D d FIG . 1 : ( Color online ) ( a ) Radial distribution functions in a nanoparticle - ﬁber mixture for nanoparticle - nanoparticle ( mainframe ) and nanoparticle - ﬁber ( inset ) pair correlations at ε fp = − 0 . 5 k B T . Numerical results in the inset are calcu - lated at δ = 0 . 25 d . ( b ) The corresponding schematic of the disorder nanoﬁber network in an equilibrium conﬁguration . Orange and yellow spheres correspond to particles adsorb - ing on the network or moving in the pore , respectively . Key parameters for sizes of ﬁber , nanoparticle , and mesh are indi - cated . B . Interacting nanoparticles in a non - adsorbing ﬁber network The particle - particle interaction also has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the structural assembly . We consider equi - librium structure of gold nanoparticles with diﬀerent val - ues of ε pp in a neutral ﬁber matrix ( ε fp = 0 ) . Numerical results of pair correlation functions are shown in Fig . 2 . Since the function g pp ( r ) shows weak response to a change of the interacting length scale , we only calcu - late for δ = 0 . 25 d . In purely repulsive particle systems ( ε pp = − 0 . 5 k B T and 0 or hard - sphere repulsion ) , parti - cles are localized to form particle cages due to geomet - rical constraints . The caging force originates from the repulsion , which leads to the glass - like structure . When the particle - particle interaction is attractive with a small amount of ε pp = 0 . 5 k B T , particles stick to each other both in pore and on the ﬁber network . This is a gel - like state formed by attractive physical bond formation . As the attraction strength is increased more ( ε pp = 1 k B T ) , the number of interparticle contacts or g pp ( D ) increase . The gelation is stronger .  pp = - 0 . 5k B T  pp = 0  pp = 0 . 5k B T  pp = 1k B T 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 . 0 0 . 6 1 . 2 1 . 8 2 . 4 g pp ( r ) r / d  P = 10 - 3  fp = 0 g f p ( r ) r / d FIG . 2 : ( Color online ) Particle - particle radial distribution functions in the non - interacting ﬁber network calculated at several values of ε pp and δ = 0 . 25 d . Inset : a nanoparticle - ﬁber radial distribution function at ε pp = 0 . Interestingly , the spatial ﬁber - particle correlation is very insensitive to ε pp . The radial distribution function g fp ( r ) is shown in the inset of Fig . 2 . It implies that interfacial adsorption is unaﬀected by the interparticle interaction but gold nanoparticles are reorganized to fa - vor either clustering in the pore or sequential multilayer adsorption . C . Laser induced temperature increase of ultra - ﬂexible metamaterials Our results in previous subsections indicate that equi - librium structures are basically insensitive to δ except for soft - repulsive ﬁber networks but are sensitive to ei - ther the interaction strength ε pp / k B T or ε fp / k B T . Par - ticles can contact to each other in the pore space or on the nanoﬁber network . The strong plasmonic coupling can occur as reducing interparticle separation distances . Very tight conﬁnement of electromagnetic ﬁelds at a gap between a pair of coupled metal nanoparticles leads to emergence of hot spots at the nanojunction interfaces [ 32 , 33 ] . In addition , optical spectra of the coupled struc - tures are signiﬁcantly shifted compared to those of the 5 isolated counterparts . Clearly , arrangement of particles can be controlled by heating . Under laser illumination , gold nanoparticles ab - sorb electromagnetic ﬁelds or optical energy of incident light via plasmonic properties . The absorbed optical en - ergy is eﬀectively converted into heat and increases the temperature . The nanoparticle assembly can be contin - uously changed with turning on and oﬀ laser light as a reversible process . Figure 3a shows the temperature proﬁle of the steady state under laser illumination with the intensity I = 30 . 4 mW / mm 2 . The packing fraction is Φ p = 2 . 3 × 10 − 3 to mimic photothermal experiments in Ref . [ 5 ] . The tem - perature rise at the surface center is ∆ T ( x = 0 , y = 0 ) = 128 0 C . In addition , the diameter of the hot area deﬁned by ∆ T ( x , y ) ≥ 96 0 C is about 5 mm . These results and our spatial contour plot are very close to the prior study [ 5 ] . This agreement between the calculations and experi - ments validates an eﬀective medium approximation used in Eqs . ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) . It means that the distribution of gold nanoparticles can be considered as a random disper - sion . Although eﬀects of interparticle plasmon coupling are expected to appear when gold nanoparticles are ther - mally reorganized , the collective heating is insensitive to this coupling enhancement . A possible reason for this behavior is the plasmonic coupling is very weak at wave - length of laser excitation . Another reason may be ε pp and ε fp (cid:28) k B T . Consequently , the nanoparticle assembly re - mains unchanged during a heating process . This explains why multiple - switching light source does not change op - tical and thermal response of the metamaterial in Ref . [ 5 ] . According to Eq . ( 6 ) , the temperature rise ∆ T is lin - early grows with the laser intensity . This clearly explains data in prior works [ 5 , 14 , 34 , 35 ] . Our linear relation is ∆ T ( x = 0 , y = 0 ) ≈ 4 . 28 I , here I is in the unit of mW / mm 2 . This calculation also quantitatively agrees with experimental results in Ref . [ 5 ] . Figure 3b and 3c show the density plots of ∆ T for higher concentrations of nanoparticles ( Φ p = 4 . 6 × 10 − 3 and 6 . 9 × 10 − 3 ) illuminated by laser light . An increase of the volume fraction of gold particles signiﬁcantly local - izes the absorbed optical energy at the interface . How - ever , since the thermal conductivity of the metamaterial grows with increasing Φ p , the light - to - heat conversion is eﬃciently conducted . As a result , the laser - induced tem - perature rise is decreased with densifying nanoparticles . This ﬁnding indicates that at the same packing fraction , replacing gold nanoparticles with TiN nanoparticles leads to a higher temperature rise since optical properties of TiN nanoparticles are similar to those of Au counterparts [ 12 ] but K bulkTiN ≈ 29 Wm − 1 K − 1 (cid:28) K p [ 36 ] . Based on Eq . ( 6 ) , we determine the dependence of ∆ T ( x = y = z = 0 ) on the light spot size . Figure 4 shows a linear relation between the steady temperature of center point on the surface and the diameter of illu - minated laser spot at Φ p = 2 . 3 × 10 − 3 , 4 . 6 × 10 − 3 , and 6 . 9 × 10 − 3 . A decrease of the incident laser spot area lin - early reduces the temperature increase . Thus , except for the intensity I , one can tune ∆ T by varying the diameter of incident light . There are many other designs for broadband near - perfect absorbers or anti - reﬂectors . In prior works , the structures are composed of a periodic array of dielec - tric micro - spheres on a metal ﬁlm [ 37 ] , a periodic ar - ray of truncated metal / dielectric cones on a metal sub - strate [ 38 ] , and a three - layer metallo - dielectric - metallo stack [ 39 ] . These metamaterials anti - reﬂect almost all of incident electromagnetic ﬁelds and these are similar to our studied metamaterial . However , they are rigid and not ﬂexible . In addition , the thermal conductivity of metal is much larger than that of ﬁber or even ﬁber mixed with plasmonic nanoparticles . Thus , under the same laser irradiation , the temperature rise of the rigid plasmonic metamaterials is smaller since heating the sys - tem of larger thermal conductivity needs more thermal energy . IV . CONCLUSIONS We have investigated equilibrium structures and plas - monic heating of ultra - ﬂexible plasmonic metamaterial including gold nanoparticles conﬁned in aramid nanoﬁber network . To validate our theoretical approach , we com - pare with experiments [ 5 ] . Experimental information needed for theoretical calculations includes ( i ) the di - ameter of nanoparticles , ( ii ) the diameter and length of each ﬁber , ( iii ) either the volume fraction or the mesh / pore size of the ﬁber matrix , ( iv ) the volume frac - tion of nanoparticles that can be calculated using weight - weight percentages , and ( v ) photothermal heating re - sults . By using the PRISM theory , we have determined the dependence of reconﬁgurable nanoparticle assemblies on temperature , the strengths of particle - particle and ﬁber - particle force , and their spatial ranges . Since the pore size is approximately equal to 3 times of particle diameter , the predicted radial distribution function re - veals that the separation distance among nanoparticles is signiﬁcantly shortened and this is strongly temperature - dependent . Gold nanoparticles can adsorb on the ﬁber network or cluster in the pore space . The reorganization of nanoparticles can lead to plasmonic coupling eﬀects , which are important for the photothermal response of the nanoparticle - ﬁber composite . To understand thermal - induced reassembly and plas - monic interactions of gold nanoparticles in this ultra - ﬂexible plasmonic metamaterial , we have theoretically calculated the temperature gradient of the metamate - rial under laser illumination . Our approach uses the analytical solution of the heat transfer diﬀerential equa - tion associated with an eﬀective medium approximation . This treatment means we ignore enhancement of electro - magnetic ﬁelds at nanogaps among plasmonic nanostruc - tures . Theoretical temperature rise agrees quantitatively well with prior photothermal characterization [ 5 ] .

Open data points and solid lines are our numeri - cal calculations and guide - to - the - eye lines , respectively . agreement indicates the plasmonic coupling eﬀect is pos - sibly small to be ignored even when the assembly of gold nanoparticles can be thermally reconﬁgured . Another possibility is that the ﬁber - particle and particle - particle interactions are much smaller than k B T and the structure of nanocomposites is nearly independent of temperature . Our work also suggests it is possible to use a random distribution model to eﬀectively describe the dispersion of nanoparticles in ﬁber matrix in the same manner as nanoparticles dispersed in aqueous solution . This theo - retical approach can be exploited for the rational design of materials with tailored functions .
