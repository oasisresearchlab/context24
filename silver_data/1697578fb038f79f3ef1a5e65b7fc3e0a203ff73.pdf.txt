Conner and Sandra L . Schmid The Scripps Research Institute , La Jolla , CA 92037 he (cid:2) 2 subunit of the AP2 complex is known to be phosphorylated in vitro by a copurifying kinase , and it has been demonstrated recently that (cid:2) 2 phosphorylation is required for transferrin endocytosis ( Olusanya , O . , P . D . Andrews , J . R . Swedlow , and E . Smythe . 2001 . Curr . Biol . 11 : 896 – 900 ) . However , the identity of the endogenous kinase responsible for this phosphorylation is unknown . Here we identify and characterize a novel member of the Prk / Ark family of serine / threonine kinases , adaptor - associated kinase ( AAK ) 1 . We ﬁnd that AAK1 copuriﬁes with adaptor protein ( AP ) 2 and that it directly binds the ear domain of (cid:3) - adaptin in vivo and in vitro . In T neuronal cells , AAK1 is enriched at presynaptic terminals , whereas in nonneuronal cells it colocalizes with clathrin and AP2 in clathrin - coated pits and at the leading edge of migrating cells . AAK1 speciﬁcally phosphorylates the (cid:2) subunit in vitro , and stage - speciﬁc assays for endocytosis show that (cid:2) phosphorylation by AAK1 results in a decrease in AP2 - stimulated transferrin internalization . Together , these results provide strong evidence that AAK1 is the endogenous (cid:2) 2 kinase and plays a regulatory role in clathrin - mediated endocytosis . These results also lend support to the idea that clathrin - mediated endocytosis is controlled by cycles of phosphorylation / desphosphorylation . Introduction Endocytic clathrin - coated vesicle ( CCV ) * formation is essential for the recycling of synaptic vesicles after neurotransmission and for receptor - mediated endocytosis that controls a variety of important biological processes including nutrient uptake , immune response , and cellular response to activated signaling receptors . Two oligomeric protein complexes , clathrin and the adaptor protein ( AP ) 2 complex , constitute the major coat proteins of these endocytic vesicles . Clathrin assembles into a polygonal lattice surrounding endocytic vesicles ( for review see Kirchhausen , 2000 ) . The het - erotetrameric AP2 complex , consisting of two (cid:2) 100 - kD subunits , the (cid:3) and (cid:4) 2 adaptins , a medium subunit , (cid:2) 2 of (cid:2) 50 kD , and a small (cid:2) 17 - kD (cid:5) 2 subunit , is multi - functional ( Kirchhausen , 1999 ) . Although the function of (cid:5) 2 is unclear , the (cid:3) and (cid:4) 2 subunits are known to mediate membrane targeting and protein – protein interactions with clathrin and other endocytic machinery components like dynamin , auxilin , Eps15 , etc . The major function of the (cid:2) 2 subunit appears to be the recognition of endocytic cargo ( Ohno et al . , 1995 ) . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is initiated by the recruitment of AP2 complexes to saturable and protease - sensitive sites on the plasma membrane ( PM ) . AP2 complexes interact directly with tyrosine - based sorting motifs on the cytoplasmic domains of receptors to affect their concentration into coated pits and coordinate the assembly of clathrin ( Schmid , 1997 ) . The assembly of clathrin into a lattice is , in turn , thought to drive invagination of the PM and thus facilitate vesicle formation ( Musacchio et al . , 1999 ) . After coat assembly , the coated pit constricts and pinches off from the PM to form a CCV . This cycle is completed by the disassembly of coat proteins and facilitated by the action of the ATPase , Hsc70 ( Hannan et al . , 1998 ; Newmyer and Schmid , 2001 ) , which releases the coat components for another round of clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Although many components of the endocytic machinery have been identified , we lack a full understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the clathrin - mediated endocytic pathway . Phosphorylation / dephosphorylation of proteins involved in endocytosis has long been implicated as a key regulatory step in controlling clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Pauloin et al . , 1988 ; Robinson et al . , 1994 ; Turner et al . , 1999 ) . For example , isolated CCVs appear to contain at least two kinase activities ( Pauloin et al . , 1984 ; Bar - Zvi and Branton , 1986 ) . One kinase activity associated with CCVs appears Address correspondence to Sandra L . Schmid , The Scripps Research Institute , 10550 N . Torrey Pines Rd . , La Jolla , CA 92037 .

Also present on CCVs is a Ca 2 (cid:6) - , calmodulin - , and cAMP - independent and poly - L - lysine – insensitive kinase activity that phosphorylates the adaptor complex component pp50 , the (cid:2) 2 subunit , in vitro ( Pauloin et al . , 1982 , 1984 ) . However , the identity of this kinase is currently unknown . In vivo labeling experiments reveal that the (cid:3) , (cid:4) 2 , and (cid:2) 2 subunits of the AP2 complex are phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues , and these phosphorylated AP2 complexes are impaired in their ability to bind clathrin cages in vitro ( Wilde and Brodsky , 1996 ) . Phosphorylation of AP2 appears to enhance binding to membranes and ty - rosine - and leucine - based sorting signals ( Fingerhut et al . , 2001 ) . Most recently , it has also been found that (cid:2) 2 phos - phorylation is essential for clathrin - mediated transferrin uptake ( Olusanya et al . , 2001 ) . Moreover , phosphorylation of coat proteins by endogenous kinase ( s ) activated by ex - ogenous melittin and poly - L - lysine is known to destabilize the clathrin coat of isolated CCVs ( Georgieva - Hanson et al . , 1988 ) . Phosphorylation also appears to be important in modulat - ing the function of several other proteins implicated in en - docytosis , including dynamin 1 , amphiphysins 1 and 2 , syn - aptojanin , epsin , and Eps15 . Indeed , these proteins are phosphorylated in resting nerve terminals and coordinately dephosphorylated upon nerve terminal stimulation ( Liu et al . , 1994 ; Bauerfeind et al . , 1997 ; Chen et al . , 1999 ; Cousin et al . , 2001 ) . Additionally , in vitro evidence suggests that phosphorylation plays a central role in regulating the pro - tein – protein interactions of amphiphysin with other en - docytic components like dynamin 1 , synaptojanin 1 , AP2 , and clathrin ( Slepnev et al . , 1998 ) . We have identified a novel S / T kinase , we now call adap - tor - associated kinase ( AAK ) 1 , by using a phage display – based protein interaction screen . We find that AAK1 binds directly to (cid:3) - adaptin in vivo and in vitro . Poly - L - lysine – independent kinase assays reveal that AAK1 specifically phosphorylates the (cid:2) subunit of the AP complex in vitro . Introduction of the ki - nase into in vitro stage - specific assays that reconstitute en - docytosis shows an inhibitory effect that strongly correlates with phosphorylation of the (cid:2) subunit . These results suggest that AAK1 may play a regulatory role in clathrin - mediated endocytosis and that in combination with an as yet unidenti - fied phosphatase ( s ) AAK1 regulates endocytosis through a phosphorylation / dephosphorylation cycle . Results Identification of a novel (cid:3) - adaptin – interacting protein To identify (cid:3) - adaptin protein - interacting partners , we em - ployed a phage display approach using the ear domain ( amino acids 701 – 938 ) as a bait to screen a rat brain cDNA library . After three rounds of biopanning and phage amplifi - cation to enrich for specific interactions , we isolated several cDNAs . As expected , we isolated phage - containing insert cDNAs that encoded proteins known to interact directly with (cid:3) - adaptin such as epsin and amphiphysin ( unpublished data ) . However , nearly a third of the isolated phage con - tained inserts that encoded a previously uncharacterized cDNA , KIAA1048 , we now call AAK1 ( Fig . 1 , AAK1 ) . Se - quence analysis predicts the cDNA to encode a S / T kinase of (cid:2) 100 kD . The encoded protein appears to be modular with the S / T kinase domain located at its NH 2 terminus . The middle domain of the protein is rich in glutamine ( 28 % ) , proline ( 18 % ) , and alanine ( 13 % ) , whereas the COOH - terminal domain encodes the region identified by Figure 1 . The predicted amino acid sequence of the AAK1 . The S / T kinase domain is underlined , whereas the COOH - terminal domain , which was identified by phage display , is in bold . This COOH - terminal domain was also used to generate polyclonal antibodies . The clathrin , EH domain , and (cid:3) - adaptin interaction motifs , DLL , NPF , and DPF , respectively , are boxed . AAK1 regulates clathrin - mediated endocytosis | Conner and Schmid 923 phage display , which we have designated the (cid:3) - adaptin – interacting domain . The COOH - terminal (cid:3) - adaptin – inter - acting domain contains three motifs demonstrated previ - ously to be important in protein – protein interactions : an (cid:3) - adaptin – interacting DPF motif ( Owen et al . , 1999 ) , an NPF motif that confers binding to EH domains ( Salcini et al . , 1997 ) , and a DLL motif known to mediate clathrin binding ( Morgan et al . , 2000 ) . BLAST searches indicate that AAK1 is similar to the Ark family of S / T kinases ( Cope et al . , 1999 ) . The greatest identity in this family of S / T kinases is within the kinase domain ( Fig . 2 ) ; however , other Ark family members appear to lack the QPA - rich middle domain of AAK1 . AAK1 is most similar to another human cDNA , DKFZp434P0116 . 1 , having (cid:2) 80 % identity in the kinase domain . DKFZp434P0116 . 1 also con - tains a middle QPA - rich domain that is 28 % identical to AAK1 . AAK1 also has a Drosophila melanogaster homologue , the Numb - associated kinase , which shares strong identity in the kinase domain , as well as sharing DLL and DPF motif features . AAK1 interacts directly with (cid:3) - adaptin To independently test the direct interaction of AAK1 with (cid:3) - adaptin , we generated a glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fu - sion protein with the COOH - terminal domain of AAK1 ( amino acids 679 – 893 ) for a GST pull - down experiment . We found that AAK1 ( 679 – 893 ) , immobilized on glutathione - agarose beads , was able to specifically pull - down the isolated ear domain ( amino acids 701 – 938 ) of (cid:3) - adaptin ( Fig . 3 , lane 2 ) as detected by immunoblot analysis probing for (cid:3) - adap - tin . Likewise , both COOH - terminal domain and full - length AAK1 – GST fusion proteins were capable of pulling down (cid:3) - adaptin from rat brain cytosol ( Fig . 3 , lanes 1 and 5 ) , whereas the GST alone control was not found to interact with (cid:3) - adaptin ( Fig . 3 , lanes 3 and 4 ) . Thus , these results demon - strate that AAK1 interacts directly with (cid:3) - adaptin in vitro . AAK1 cofractionates with APs and clathrin - coated vesicles To determine the subcellular localization of endogenous AAK1 , we generated antibodies against the COOH - terminal (cid:3) - adaptin – interacting domain and found them to recognize , by immunoblot analysis , a single polypeptide in lysates from rat brain , bovine brain , and rat liver ( Fig . 4 ; unpublished data ) . Interestingly , the polypeptide migrates as an (cid:2) 145 - kD species in rat or bovine brain lysates and at the predicted mo - lecular weight of (cid:2) 100 kD in rat liver lysates . Although the reason for these MW differences was not explored , it is likely that they are accounted for by tissue - specific splice variants . Since AAK1 is capable of interacting directly with APs in vitro , we postulated that if these interactions occur in vivo AAK1 should share a similar subcellular fractionation pattern . Bovine brain fractionation experiments reveal that the major - ity of AAK1 is associated with membranes and that it cofrac - tionates with AP complexes and clathrin ( Fig . 4 A ) . When CCVs , clathrin , and APs isolated from bovine brain and CCVs from rat liver were tested for the presence of AAK1 , we found that it was present in all three protein samples ( Fig . 4 B , lanes 1 – 4 ) . Moreover , AAK1 was present in immunoprecipi - tated AP2 samples ( unpublished data ) . These combined ob - servations strongly argue that AAK1 interacts directly with AP complexes in vivo and suggests that AAK1 in these fractions might regulate clathrin and AP function . AAK1 localizes to regions active in endocytosis AAK1 binds directly to AP2 . Thus , if AAK1 plays a role in regulating aspects of clathrin - mediated endocytosis we would expect it to be enriched in regions of the cell that are active in endocytosis . To test this idea , rat hippo - Figure 2 . AAK1 shares strong identity to the Ark family of S / T kinases in the kinase domain .

AAK1 – GST fusion proteins , COOH - terminal domain , or full - length AAK1 consisting of amino acids 679 – 893 and 1 – 893 , respectively , immobilized on glutathione - agarose beads were incubated with the COOH - terminal domain of (cid:3) - adaptin ( amino acids 701 – 938 , lane 2 ) or rat brain cytosol ( RBC , lanes 1 and 5 ) . Immunoblot analysis probing for the presence of (cid:3) - adaptin reveals that AAK1 is capable of interacting directly with the COOH - terminal domain of (cid:3) - adaptin ( lane 2 ) and the full - length protein in rat brain cytosol ( lanes 1 and 5 ) . This interaction is likely through AAK1 DPF motifs . pAb 0927 and mAb AP . 6 were used to detect full - length (cid:3) - adaptin and its COOH - terminal domain , respectively . 924 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 156 , Number 5 , 2002 campal neurons were cultured in the presence of a fluid phase endocytic marker , rhodamine - dextran ( Fig . 5 A ) , and then probed for AAK1 ( Fig . 5 B ) . We found good colocalization of AAK1 with the endocytosed marker in these cells ( Fig . 5 C ) . Indeed , AAK1 colocalized with a variety of components of the endocytic machinery , in - cluding clathrin ( unpublished data ) , AP2 ( Fig . 5 F ) , and dynamin 1 ( Fig . 5 I ) , all proteins known to be highly en - riched at presynaptic terminals . AAK1 also colocalized to endocytic structures in nonneuronal cells . Immunolocal - ization of AAK1 in HeLa cells revealed a punctate immu - nolabeling pattern throughout the cell ( Fig . 6 A ) that colocalized with AP2 ( Fig . 6 C ) . Interestingly , in migrat - ing cells AAK1 was highly enriched at the leading edge ( Fig . 6 D ) , where it was also found to colocalize with AP2 and clathrin ( Fig . 6 , F and I , respectively ) . The localiza - tion of AAK1 to sites active in endocytosis and its colo - calization with known components of the endocytic ma - chinery is consistent with the hypothesis that AAK1 plays a functional role in regulating clathrin - mediated endocy - tosis in these regions of the cell . Figure 5 . Immunolocalization of AAK1 in rat hippocampal neurons . Rat hippocampal neurons were incubated with rhodamine - dextran ( A ) , which marks sites of endocytosis , and then fixed and stained with pAb 5366 to detect AAK1 ( B ) . AAK1 colocalizes with sites active in endocytosis ( C , yellow overlay ) . Likewise , AAK1 immunolabel ( E and H ) is found to colocalize with regions that are highly enriched in AP2 ( D , mAb AP . 6 immunolabel ) and dynamin 1 ( G , mAb hudy1 immunolabel ) as revealed by their overlays ( F and I ) . Images were visualized by confocal microscopy . Figure 4 . AAK1 is enriched in bovine brain membrane fractions and associated with isolated CCV and AP2 preparations . ( A ) Immunoblot analysis reveals that AAK1 ( visualized with pAb 5366 ) cofractionates with both clathrin ( visualized with mAb TD . 1 ) and APs ( visualized with mAb 100 - 1 that recognizes both (cid:4) 1 and (cid:4) 2 subunits ) , which are found in the low ( P1 ) and high ( P2 ) speed membrane pellets of homogenized bovine brain . Treatment of the high speed membrane pellet , which is highly enriched for clathrin - coated vesicles , with 0 . 75 M Tris , pH 7 , extracts the majority of AAK1 to a soluble pool ( ES ) ; however , a fraction of AAK1 remains membrane associated when the extracted membranes are repelleted ( EP ) . Each lane represents equivalent fractions of each sample .

Cr , crude bovine brain homogenate ; S1 , low speed supernatant ; S2 , high speed supernatant ( cytosol ) . AAK1 specifically phosphorylates the (cid:2) subunit of APs AAK1 encodes a S / T kinase , and thus we were interested in identifying phosphorylation substrates . We find that when isolated baculovirus - expressed AAK1 is incubated alone in the presence of [ (cid:7) 32 - P ] ATP , it is capable of autophosphory - lation ( Fig . 7 A , lane 1 ) . However , since AAK1 cofraction - ates and interacts directly with APs we next asked if AAK1 was capable of phosphorylating proteins contained in these fractions . Previously , it has been observed that fractions en - riched in either APs or CCVs contain an endogenous ki - nase ( s ) , and incubation of these fractions with [ (cid:7) 32 - P ] ATP results in phosphorylation of several proteins , the predomi - nant being (cid:2) , which migrates at (cid:2) 50 kD ( Pauloin and Thu - rieau , 1993 ) ( Fig . 5 A , lane 2 ) . Addition of recombinant AAK1 to AP fractions results in an increased phosphoryla - tion of the 50 - kD protein ( Fig . 7 A , lane 3 , arrowhead ) , in addition to the AAK1 autophosphorylation band . We ob - serve this same enriched 50 - kD phosphorylation pattern when AAK1 is incubated with clathrin - coated vesicles and [ (cid:7) 32 - P ] ATP ( unpublished data ) . No other phosphorylation products appear to be generated by the presence of recombi - nant AAK1 . To verify that the enriched phosphorylated 50 - kD prod - uct that results from AAK1 addition to AP protein prepara - tions was indeed (cid:2) , kinase assays were performed with APs and the (cid:2) subunits were immunoprecipitated ( after dissoci - ating the AP2 complex ) using antibodies specific for either AAK1 regulates clathrin - mediated endocytosis | Conner and Schmid 925 (cid:2) 1 or (cid:2) 2 . We find that both (cid:2) 1 and (cid:2) 2 phosphorylation was increased as a result of AAK1 addition over the endoge - nous kinase activity ( Fig . 7 B ) . Given that AAK1 is capable of autophosphorylation and that it migrates in a similar re - gion of the gel as the (cid:3) and (cid:4) 2 subunits of the adaptor com - plex , we also immunoprecipitated (cid:3) and (cid:4) 2 subunits with specific antibodies to test for their phosphorylation . How - ever , neither of these proteins was phosphorylated as a result of AAK1 addition to APs ( unpublished data ) . These results provide strong evidence that (cid:2) is a specific target of AAK1 phosphorylation in CCVs and suggests that the observed phosphorylation of (cid:2) can be attributed to the presence of endogenous AAK1 in these samples ( Fig . 4 ) . Nevertheless , these results do not exclude the possibility of other unidenti - fied kinases with (cid:2) as their substrate . AAK1 inhibits AP2 - dependent transferrin endocytosis To test the potential function of AAK1 in clathrin - mediated endocytosis , we employed an in vitro stage - specific perfo - rated cell assay that faithfully reconstitutes early and late stages of endocytosis . This assay measures the ATP - and cy - tosol - dependent sequestration of receptor - bound biotin - ylated transferrin ( BTfn ) into constricted coated pits and coated vesicles ( Carter et al . , 1993 ) . The addition of purified AP2 complexes , in a concentration - dependent manner , stimulates the formation of coated pits and increases the effi - ciency of BTfn sequestration into constricted coated pits ( Fig . 8 A ) ( Smythe et al . , 1992 ; McLauchlan et al . , 1998 ) . However , supplementing each reaction with 30 (cid:2) g / ml re - combinant AAK1 – GST fusion protein results in a decrease in AP2 - stimulated BTfn sequestration with maximal inhibi - tion at substoichiometric levels of AAK1 relative to APs ( Fig . Figure 7 . AAK1 preferentially phosphorylates the (cid:2) subunit . ( A ) Isolated baculovirus - expressed AAK1 – GST fusion protein is capable of autophosphorylation in vitro when incubated with [ (cid:7) - 32 P ] ATP ( lane 1 ) . Likewise , incubation of AAK1 – GST with fractions enriched in APs shows an increase in phosphorylation of a (cid:2) 50 - kD protein over APs alone ( arrowhead , lane 2 compared with 3 ) . ( B ) The (cid:2) 50 - kD band , which is preferentially phosphorylated by AAK1 , was identified as (cid:2) by immunoprecipitation with pAbs against (cid:2) 1 and (cid:2) 2 . 8 A ) . From these results , we postulated that the observed in - hibition was due to the additional kinase activity of AAK1 in these reaction mixtures . To test this idea , we inactivated AAK1 – GST fusion protein by preincubation with 1 mM fluorosulphonylbenzoyladenosine ( FSBA ) , an ATP analogue that irreversibly binds to the ATP - binding site and has been demonstrated recently to inactivate the endogenous kinase activity found in AP preparations ( Olusanya et al . , 2001 ) . Supplementing reactions with 30 (cid:2) g / ml FSBA - treated AAK1 ( free FSBA removed by gel filtration ) had little effect on AP2 - stimulated BTfn sequestration at AP concentrations up to 173 (cid:2) g / ml . However , at higher AP concentrations we Figure 6 . AAK1 associates with endocytic structures in HeLa cells . AAK1 ( A ) shows good colocalization with AP2 ( B , mAb AP . 6 immunolabel ) in nonmigrating HeLa cells as observed in their overlay ( C , yellow ) . In migrating HeLa cells , AAK1 is highly enriched at the leading edge ( D and G , arrow ) where it colocalizes with AP2 ( E ) and clathrin ( H , mAb X22 immunolabel ) . Immunolocalizations visualized by confocal micros - copy . Bars , 5 (cid:2) m . 926 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 156 , Number 5 , 2002 begin to observe an inhibitory effect , though not to the same magnitude as the addition of untreated AAK1 . GST alone was not found to have any effect on AP - stimulated endocy - tosis ( unpublished data ) . These observations suggest that AAK1 plays a role in AP2 - stimulated endocytosis and that the majority of the observed inhibition results from the ad - ditional AAK1 kinase activity . AAK1 phosphorylates the (cid:2) subunit of the AP complex ( Fig . 5 ) ; thus , we postulated that the observed decrease in AP2 - stimulated BTfn internalization was the result of (cid:2) phosphorylation . Not surprisingly , kinase assays reveal in - creased (cid:2) phosphorylation with an increase in AP concen - tration ( Fig . 8 B ) . Likewise , the addition of 30 (cid:2) g / ml of AAK1 resulted in an increase in (cid:2) phosphorylation over the endogenous kinase activity . No additional (cid:2) phosphoryla - tion was observed by the addition of 30 (cid:2) g / ml FSBA - treated AAK1 . These experiments reveal a strong correlation be - tween increased (cid:2) phosphorylation and inhibition of AP2 - stimulated BTfn sequestration . However , we also wanted to test the possibility that another AAK1 target might be present in either cytosol or on A431 membrane prepara - tions . Aside from AAK1 autophosphorylation , kinase assays incorporating membrane or cytosol preparations reveal no other substantial phosphorylation products resulting from AAK1 addition ( Fig . 8 C ) , although we cannot exclude other minor phosphorylation events . Collectively , these data provide functional evidence that AAK1 plays a role in AP2 - stimulated endocytosis at an early step by specifically phos - phorylating the (cid:2) subunit of the AP complex . Discussion We have identified a previously uncharacterized S / T kinase , AAK1 , that specifically interacts with APs and phosphory - lates the (cid:2) subunit of AP complexes . Although it is clear that (cid:2) 2 phosphorylation occurs in vitro and in vivo ( Pauloin and Thurieau , 1993 ; Wilde and Brodsky , 1996 ) , the conse - quence of this phosphorylation has not been elucidated . Ac - cumulating evidence suggests several possible roles for the phosphorylation of (cid:2) 2 . Since the (cid:2) 2 subunit can interact directly with tyrosine - based internalization motifs ( Ohno et al . , 1995 , 1996 ; Rapoport et al . , 1997 ) , it has been postu - lated to function in cargo recognition . Thus , it is possible that phosphorylation of the (cid:2) 2 subunit might modulate the Figure 8 . Phosphorylation of (cid:2) by AAK1 inhibits AP2 - stimulated BTfn sequestration . ( A ) APs stimulate the sequestration of BTfn in a concentration - dependent manner in stage - specific in vitro endocytosis assays that measure AP2 - stimulated constricted coated pit formation ( grey bars ) . However , the addition of 30 (cid:2) g / ml recombinant AAK1 – GST fusion protein results in a decrease in AP2 - dependent stimulation ( black bars ) . In contrast , addition of 30 (cid:2) g / ml FSBA - treated AAK1 – GST fusion protein has little effect on AP2 stimulation up to an AP concentration of 173 (cid:2) g / ml ( white bars ) . Results are the mean (cid:8) SEM of six experiments . ( B ) AAK1 - dependent inhibition directly correlates with the phosphorylation of (cid:2) . The autoradiogram shows that increased (cid:2) phosphorylation is observed when increasing concentrations of APs are incubated with [ (cid:7) - 32 P ] ATP . Likewise , the addition of 30 (cid:2) g / ml of AAK1 – GST fusion protein results in a significant increase in (cid:2) phosphorylation , whereas 30 (cid:2) g / ml FSBA - treated AAK1 – GST fusion protein shows only endogenous levels of (cid:2) phosphorylation . Note that we sometimes resolve a (cid:2) doublet on gradient gels in our kinase assays . Phosphorylated (cid:2) was quantitated ( graph below ) using the ImageQuant Software package from Molecular Dynamics , and the graph represents the mean of two kinase experiments . ( C ) AAK1 specifically phosphorylates the (cid:2) subunit of APs . APs , K562 cytosol , and A431 membrane preparations were each incubated with [ (cid:7) - 32 P ] ATP in the presence or absence of AAK1 – GST . Only the (cid:2) subunit ( arrowhead ) of APs is significantly phosphorylated as a result of additional AAK1 – GST ( AAK1 autophosphorylation , arrow ) . AAK1 regulates clathrin - mediated endocytosis | Conner and Schmid 927 ability of APs to be recruited to sorting signals or vice versa . Indeed , it has been observed that phosphorylation of the (cid:2) 2 , (cid:3) , and (cid:4) 2 subunits enhances AP2 association with the tyro - sine - and leucine - based sorting motifs of the mannose - 6 - phosphate receptor and lysosomal acid phosphatase pre - cursor , respectively ( Fingerhut et al . , 2001 ) . Moreover , recent results from Höning and colleagues ( Ricotta et al . , 2002 ) demonstrate that phosphorylation of (cid:2) 2 enhances the affin - ity of AP2 for internalization motifs , independent of the in - fluence of the large AP subunits . (cid:2) 2 phosphorylation may also be important in regulating interactions between AP2 and clathrin . Yeast two - hybrid screens have defined a direct interaction between (cid:4) 2 - adaptin and (cid:2) 2 ( Page and Robinson , 1995 ) . It has also been found that the AP2 interaction with clathrin is mediated through the hinge region of (cid:4) 2 ( Shih et al . , 1995 ) and phosphory - lated APs are impaired in their ability to bind clathrin cages in vitro ( Wilde and Brodsky , 1996 ) . Although the phosphor - ylated AP subunits responsible for preventing interaction with clathrin have not been defined , it is reasonable to pos - tulate that conformational changes in (cid:2) 2 and / or (cid:4) 2 that re - sult from (cid:2) 2 phosphorylation might play a regulatory role in AP2 – clathrin interaction . Recently , (cid:2) 2 phosphorylation has been shown to be re - quired for clathrin - mediated endocytosis of transferrin ( Olu - sanya et al . , 2001 ) . Olusanya and colleagues found that by preventing the phosphorylation of (cid:2) 2 , either by inhibiting the endogenous kinase activity found in AP2 preparations with the ATP analogue , FSBA , or by site - directed mutagenesis of the (cid:2) 2 phosphorylation site , transferrin uptake was inhibited in vitro and in vivo , respectively . In contrast , we find that sup - plementing endocytosis assays with AAK1 , an endogenous ki - nase in AP2 preparations , and thus increasing the phosphory - lation state of (cid:2) 2 , results in an inhibitory effect . However , we do not believe these two results are contradictory . The experi - ments of Olusanya et al . ( 2001 ) allow for a single round of (cid:2) 2 phosphorylation , whereas the addition of AAK1 in our ex - periments allows for multiple rounds of phosphorylation . Together , these results suggest that , although (cid:2) 2 phosphory - lation is essential for endocytosis , maintaining (cid:2) 2 in a phos - phorylated state , by the addition of exogenous AAK1 , results in an inhibition of transferrin uptake . This suggests that a pro - tein phosphatase is required in clathrin - mediated endocytosis to dephosphorylate (cid:2) 2 . Interestingly , AP2 preparations are known to copurify with a phosphatase activity that efficiently dephosphorylates APs during AP complex purification ( Mor - ris et al . , 1990 ) . Similarly , analyses of coated membrane pro - teins in intact neurons failed to detect (cid:2) 2 phosphorylation ( Keen and Black , 1986 ) , which hints at the presence of an ac - tive (cid:2) 2 phosphatase in these cells . Although this is in contrast with the observed (cid:2) 2 phosphorylation in nonneuronal cells ( Wilde and Brodsky , 1996 ) , this difference may reflect the rel - ative activities of the clathrin - mediated endocytic pathway in neuronal verses nonneuronal tissues . Given these observations , we hypothesize that AAK1 functions to phosphorylate (cid:2) 2 and facilitate AP2 recruit - ment to tyrosine - and leucine - containing sorting signals . The binding of AP2 to sorting signals could then facilitate the concentration of cargo molecules through AP self - assem - bly properties . Once concentration of cargo has occurred , an as yet unidentified phosphatase would be required to de - phosphorylate (cid:2) 2 and allow AP2 to interact with clathrin and progress through the process of vesicle formation . This simple model predicts that endocytosis is tightly regulated by cycles of phosphorylation / dephosphorylation . However , it is most likely an oversimplification given that several other components of the endocytic machinery are known to be co - ordinately phosphorylated / dephosphorylated during the cy - cle of clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Whether AAK1 phos - phorylates other components of the endocytic machinery awaits determination . It is interesting to note that Prk1p , an Ark kinase fam - ily member , regulates Pan1p activity by phosphorylation . Pan1p is a yeast homologue of Eps15 , a protein known to function in endocytosis ( Wendland and Emr , 1998 ) , and is marked for phosphorylation on the threonine residue of LxxQxTG motifs ( Zeng and Cai , 1999 ) . The phosphoryla - tion site of (cid:2) 2 has been mapped to threonine 156 ( Pauloin and Thurieau , 1993 ; Olusanya et al . , 2001 ) , and it shares a similar motif [ IxxQxTG ] with isoleucine being substituted for leucine in the first position . The AAK1 , that copurifies with AP2 , has been shown recently to phosphorylate (cid:2) 2 at this same site ( Ricotta et al . , 2002 ) , and thus it is likely that (cid:2) 2 is targeted for AAK1 phosphorylation through its Ixx - QxTG motif . An important next step will be to test the in vivo conse - quences of perturbing AAK1 function on endocytosis . Since AAK1 is localized to the leading edge of migrating cells , a re - gion active in actin turnover and remodeling , and is related to Ark1p and Prk1p , proteins shown to be involved in regulating actin organization in yeast ( Cope et al . , 1999 ) and endocytosis ( Zeng and Cai , 1999 ) , there is a strong possibility that AAK1 may also function to coordinate cytoskeletal actin dynamics and endocytosis . Additionally , it will be important to identify AAK1 - interacting partners that potentially modulate its activ - ity . The identification of AAK1 partners and potentially other phosphorylation substrates and the identification of the en - dogenous phosphatase found in AP preparations will help to understand how the cycle of phosphorylation / dephosphoryla - tion regulates clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Materials and methods Phage display library production and biopanning To construct the rat brain phage display library , mRNA was isolated from rat brain according to established protocols ( Schibler et al . , 1980 ) and used for cDNA production using a random primed OrientExpress cDNA synthe - sis kit ( Novagen ) . The resulting cDNA was then used in the construction of a phage display library using the T7Select System ( Novagen ) . The derived rat brain phage display library was then used for biopanning according the T7Select System manual . For biopanning , a GST fusion protein with the ear domain of (cid:3) - adaptin ( amino acids 701 – 938 ; a gift from L . Traub , University of Pittsburgh , Pitts - burgh , PA ) was immobilized on a glutathione - agarose matrix ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . The phage display library was incubated with the im - mobilized (cid:3) - adaptin ear in the presence of a panning buffer ( 0 . 5 % BSA , 25 (cid:2) g / ml sheared salmon sperm DNA , 0 . 5 % NP - 40 , 25 (cid:2) g / ml heparin , 0 . 05 % sodium azide , all in PBS , pH 7 . 4 ) for 1 h at room temperature . The (cid:3) - adaptin ear immobilized ligand with bound phage was then washed with 10 column vol of PBS , pH 7 . 4 . Bound phage were then amplified by inoculating BLT5403 bacterial cells ( OD 600 (cid:9) 0 . 75 ) , and incubating with constant shak - ing at 37 (cid:10) C until cell lysis was observed ( (cid:2) 2 . 5 h ) . Bacterial debris was re - moved by centrifugation , and the supernatant was used for further rounds of biopanning with new immobilized (cid:3) - adaptin ear ligand . After three rounds 928 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 156 , Number 5 , 2002 of biopanning and phage amplification to enrich for specific protein interac - tions , phage were plated on BLT5403 cell lawns , plaques were isolated , and cDNA inserts were amplified by PCR using the T7Select UP ( 5 (cid:11) - GGAGCT - GTCGTATTCCAGTC - 3 (cid:11) ) and DN ( 5 (cid:11) - AACCCCTCAAGACCCGTTTAG - 3 (cid:11) ) primers and used for DNA sequencing . Preparation of cDNA constructs The COOH - terminal domain of AAK1 ( amino acids 679 – 893 ) was ob - tained from isolated phage by PCR using the T7Select UP and DN primers ( see above ) . The PCR product was cloned into pCR2 . 1 using the Topo cloning kit ( Invitrogen ) . The COOH - terminal cDNA fragment was then ex - cised by an EcoRI and XhoI digest for subcloning into pGEX4T - 3 ( Amer - sham Pharmacia Biotech ) for the generation of a GST fusion protein . Hu - man full - length AAK1 ( clone KIAA1048 ; GenBank / EMBL / DDBJ under accession no . BC002695 ) cDNA constructs in pBluescript were provided by the Kazusa Research Institute ( Kisarazu , Chiba , Japan ) . This full - length cDNA insert was subcloned into pVL1393 ( PharMingen ) for baculovirus expression by PCR using primers 5 (cid:11) - TCTAGACATATGCAGCCAAAGGC - CAGACTG - 3 (cid:11) and 5 (cid:11) - GAATTCTTGGGTTTTGGGGGATGAGG - 3 (cid:11) to intro - duce XbaI and EcoRI cloning sites , respectively . A COOH - terminal GST tag was introduced into the pVL1393 AAK1 construct by subcloning GST from pGEX4T - 3 ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) by PCR with 5 (cid:11) - GGAAT - TCCTGGTTCCGCGTGGGTCCATGTCCCCTATACTAGGTTATTG - 3 (cid:11) and 5 (cid:11) - GCGGCCGCTTACAGATCCGATTTTGGAGGATGG - 3 (cid:11) primers con - taining EcoRI and NotI restriction sites , respectively , into the appropriate pVL1393 restriction sites . Fusion protein expression and isolation The pGEX4T - 3 GST fusion construct containing the COOH - terminal do - main of AAK1 ( amino acids 679 – 893 ) was transformed into BL21 ( DE3 ) cells . Expression of the fusion protein was induced by the addition of 0 . 1 mM IPTG for 3 h at 25 (cid:10) C . Bacterial cells were lysed by nitrogen cavitation , cellular debris was removed by centrifugation , and the soluble fraction containing the expressed fusion protein was isolated using glutathione - agarose beads . Bound protein was eluted from beads using 20 mM re - duced glutathione in TBST ( 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 9 % NaCl , 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 , and 0 . 5 % BSA ) and used for in vitro binding experiments or as an immunogen for antibody production ( see below ) . The full - length AAK1 – GST fusion construct in pVL1393 was used for protein expression using the BaculoGold Expression System following manufacturer protocols ( PharMingen ) . After infection with generated baculovirus and expression in TN5 cells , cells were pelleted , processed , and fusion protein was iso - lated following identical procedures as those followed for bacterially ex - pressed GST fusion proteins above . In vitro protein interaction tests Affinity matrices made with GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione - agarose beads were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with isolated pro - tein or bovine brain cytosol in TBST . Matrices were then washed with 10 column vol of TBST , and bound protein was analyzed by SDS - PAGE . Antibodies Polyclonal antibodies against (cid:2) 1 and (cid:2) 2 were gifts from M . Robinson ( Uni - versity of Cambridge , Cambridge , UK ) . The monoclonal antibodies , AP . 6 ( Chin et al . , 1989 ) , against (cid:3) - adaptin , and the monoclonal antibodies , TD . 1 ( Nathke et al . , 1992 ) and X22 ( Brodsky , 1985 ) , against clathrin were gifts from F . Brodsky ( University of California , San Francisco , CA ) . The monoclo - nal antibody against (cid:4) - adaptin , 100 - 1 ( Ahle et al . , 1988 ) , was a gift from E . Ungewickell ( Hanover Medical School , Hanover , Germany ) . The monoclo - nal ( Warnock et al . , 1995 ) , against dynamin , hudy1 , and the polyclonal anti - body against AP2 , 0927 ( Hannan et al . , 1998 ) , were generated in this lab . To generate antibodies to AAK1 ( designated # 5366 and # 5367 ) , the iso - lated COOH - terminal domain ( amino acids 679 – 893 ) fused to GST within a pGEX4T - 3 vector was purified from Escherichia coli and used as an im - munogen . The immunogen was resuspended in Freund’s adjuvant , in - jected subcutaneously into New Zealand white rabbits every 4 wk for 3 mo , and sera was collected from the central ear artery according to de - scribed protocols ( Harlow and Lane , 1988 ) . Electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis Cell fractions were subjected to SDS - PAGE and immunoblot analysis as described ( Towbin et al . , 1979 ) . Cell fractions were pelleted , resuspended in SDS - PAGE sample buffer , and denatured for 2 min at 100 (cid:10) C . The pro - teins were resolved on an acrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunolabeling as described ( Towbin et al . , 1979 ) or stained with Ponceau S ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . For immunoblots , blots were washed twice for a total of 30 min in TBST and then incubated for 30 min in TBST contain - ing diluted antibody ( 1 : 2 , 000 ) . The blots were then washed three times in TBST over 30 min and incubated in TBST with goat anti – rabbit antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase ( Sigma - Aldrich ) diluted 1 : 10 , 000 . Blots were washed in TBST three more times over 30 min . Immunolabel signals were detected by BCIP / NBT colorimetric development as described ( Harlow and Lane , 1988 ) . Controls used in this experiment included blots incubated with preimmune antisera and secondary antibody alone . Each of these immunoblots showed no signal ( unpublished data ) . Bovine brain fractionation Bovine brains were harvested immediately after slaughter , frozen on dry ice , and stored at (cid:12) 70 (cid:10) C for later use . Frozen brains were defrosted rapidly using room temperature MES buffer ( 100 mM MES , pH 6 . 5 , 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM PMSF , 0 . 8 mM DTT , 0 . 02 % NaN 3 ) . Brain tis - sue ( 700 g ) was rinsed in MES buffer and homogenized with an equal vol - ume of buffer in a Waring Blender . The homogenate ( Cr ) was centrifuged at 15 , 000 g for 30 min at 4 (cid:10) C . This low speed pellet ( P1 ) and supernatant ( S1 ) were collected , and the supernatant was then centrifuged at 100 , 000 g for 1 h at 4 (cid:10) C in a Ti45 rotor ( Beckman Coulter ) . The crude microsomal pellet ( P2 ) containing CCVs was resuspended in extraction buffer ( 0 . 75 M Tris , pH 7 . 0 , 0 . 1 mM PMSF , 0 . 1 mM DTT ) using a dounce homogenizer and allowed to incubate for 20 min at 4 (cid:10) C . The sample was then centri - fuged at 100 , 000 g for 1 h at 4 (cid:10) C in a Ti45 rotor and the supernatant ( ES , containing released clathrin and APs ) and pellet ( EP ) were collected . Col - lected samples were then analyzed by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting . Clathrin - coated vesicles and AP complexes were isolated as described pre - viously ( Hannan et al . , 1998 ; Smythe et al . , 1992 ) . Kinase assays Kinase assays were performed essentially as described ( Wilde and Brod - sky , 1996 ) with minor modification . Briefly , isolated baculovirus expressed AAK1 – GST and cell fractions were inoculated in kinase buffer ( 150 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 100 (cid:2) M [ (cid:7) - 32 P ] ATP ) for 15 min at room temperature . The kinase reaction was stopped by precipitating the protein with the addi - tion of TCA to a final concentration of 10 % . Precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation , the supernatant containing free [ (cid:7) - 32 P ] ATP was aspirated , and the pellet was resuspended in 0 . 1 M NaOH and SDS - PAGE protein sample buffer and boiled for 2 min at 100 (cid:10) C . Proteins were re - solved on a 10 – 20 % gradient polyacrylamide gel ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) , transferred to nitrocellulose , exposed to a phosphorimaging plate , and an - alyzed using the ImageQuant Software package ( Molecular Dynamics ) . To inactivate AAK1 – GST fusion proteins , isolated protein was treated with 1 mM FSBA ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 30 min at room temperature . Unbound FSBA was removed from protein preparations by gel filtration using G25 minispin column ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) , and eluted protein was used in both kinase and in vitro endocytosis assays . Immunoprecipitation of phosphorylated proteins After the kinase assay , the phosphorylation reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 % SDS in H 2 0 to a final concentration of 1 % and boiled for 2 min at 100 (cid:10) C . The reaction was then resuspended in RIPA buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 5 % deoxycholate , 0 . 1 % SDS , 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 ) and proteins preabsorbed with protein G beads ( Amersham Pharmacia Bio - tech ) for 1 h at room temperature . Beads were pelleted , and samples were transferred to a new Eppendorf tube containing diluted antibodies ( 1 : 1000 ) specific for either (cid:2) 1 , (cid:2) 2 , (cid:3) - adaptin , or (cid:4) 2 - adaptin and incubated with constant rocking for 1 h at room temperature . Protein G beads were then added to each sample and incubated for 1 h at room temperature , beads were pelleted , washed with 10 bead vol of RIPA buffer , and pelleted pro - tein G beads were resuspended in SDS - PAGE sample buffer , boiled for 2 min at 100 (cid:10) C and resolved by SDS - PAGE , transferred to nitrocellulose , and placed on a phosphoimaging plate for analysis . Immunolocalizations and rhodamine - dextran uptake For Immunofluorescence experiments , HeLa cells were grown on coverslips and then fixed with ice cold 4 % formaldehyde for 25 min . Cells were washed three times with TBST and then incubated with the designated antibodies for 1 h at room temperature . Samples were washed three times with TBST , and the appropriate secondary antibodies were added at 1 : 5 , 000 dilution and in - cubated for 1 h at room temperature . For rhodamine - dextran uptake experi - ments , rat hippocampal neurons were incubated for 10 min at 37 (cid:10) C in the presence of 100 (cid:2) M rhodamine - dextran ( Molecular Probes ) , cells were washed three times with TBS to remove excess rhodamine - dextran , and then fixed and processed as described above . Samples were visualized by laser scanning confocal microscopy with a Bio - Rad Laboratories 1024 .
