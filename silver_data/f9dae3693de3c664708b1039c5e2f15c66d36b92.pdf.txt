Wolynes , University of California , San Diego , La Jolla , CA , and approved August 25 , 2010 ( received for review May 14 , 2010 ) We combine experiment and computer simulation to show how macromolecular crowding dramatically affects the structure , func - tion , and folding landscape of phosphoglycerate kinase ( PGK ) . Fluorescence labeling shows that compact states of yeast PGK are populated as the amount of crowding agents ( Ficoll 70 ) increases .

Above the optimum , folding slows down because of increased viscosity . enzymatic activity ∣ FRET ∣ folding kinetics ∣ thermal denaturation ∣ protein conformational changes P hosphoglycerate kinase ( PGK ) is a 415 - residue metabolic enzyme that produces ATP and is composed of two roughly equally sized subunits connected by a flexible hinge ( 1 ) . In the crystal structure , the ADP and diphosphoglycerate binding sites , each located at an N and C subunit , are separated . It has been suggested that a large - scale conformational change ( 2 ) is neces - sary to bring the two subunits together when the phosphoryl group is catalytically transferred , and a hinge - bending mechanism has been postulated ( 3 ) , bringing together both substrates at the inner surfaces of the C and N subdomains ( 4 , 5 ) . It is still unclear how the conformational and folding dynamics of PGK is affected by the interior of a cell , which is heavily crowded by macromolecules ( 6 , 7 ) . Various computational and theoretical studies have been developed to address the effect of volume exclusion exerted by surrounding macromolecules on protein activity inside cells , called the “ macromolecular crowding effect ” ( 8 ) . This effect , in addition to weak chemical interactions between proteins and crowders ( 9 ) , can stabilize the folded states of a protein relative to the unfolded state ( 10 ) , perturb folding barriers ( 11 , 12 ) , and alter folding rates ( 13 ) and folding routes ( 14 ) . Macromolecular crowding could selectively stabilize one folded protein structure over another ( 8 , 15 – 17 ) , particularly for proteins that are structurally malleable so their domains aligned in different orientations would have similar free energies ( 18 ) . Thus , what we regard as the native structural ensemble depends on whether the protein is in aqueous buffer , in a solution crowded by macromolecules , or packed in a crystal . In our work , structural changes of PGK are revealed by FRET experiments where the N and C termini are labeled with AcGFP1 and mCherry as fluorescent markers ( Fig . 1 ) . A crowded environment is achieved by the addition of inert Ficoll 70 carbo - hydrate to the samples . When the crowding content is increased , we observe changes in FRET that point to new compact struc - tures being populated . Our simulations provide a high - resolution interpretation of the structural changes induced in PGK by crowding . Upon crowding , two other compact conformations [ collapsed crystal ( CC ) and spherical ( Sph ) ] exceed the stability of the crystal structure . Strikingly , these structural changes of PGK upon crowding have a major functional consequence . An enzymatic activity assay shows that ATP production is enhanced over 25 - fold in the crowded wild - type enzyme , when taking into account increased solvent viscosity . The donor / acceptor labeled PGK also becomes much more enzymatically active . We suggest that in vivo , PGK is already structurally primed to catalyze by forming in a collapsed compact form ( e . g . , CC and / or Sph structural ensembles ) rather than requiring hinge motions . The effects of crowding on PGK folding kinetics are also very pronounced . We measured the folding / unfolding relaxation time τ near the thermal denaturation midpoint of PGK . A plot of ln τ vs . Ficoll concentration has a “ v ” or chevron shape , indicating that there is an optimal crowder concentration for fastest folding . This observation is in accord with theory and computational models ( 13 ) . High concentrations of sucrose do not show similar structural or kinetic effects , so the connectivity of Ficoll and hence crowding are needed to affect the large amplitude motions of the two - subunit protein PGK , be it functional dynamics invol - ving enzymatic activity ( a new compact native state ) or folding dynamics ( crowding - viscosity competition ) .

Monitoring the steady - state donor – acceptor ( D / A ) ratio of the construct at 22 . 3 (cid:1) 0 . 5 °C , we observed a small but reproducible lag upon going from 0 mg ∕ ml Ficoll to 50 mg ∕ ml Ficoll . As the concentration of Ficoll was further increased , D / A decreased continuously ( Fig . 2 A ) . The highest Ficoll concentration of 300 mg ∕ ml corre - sponds to an experimental crowder volume fraction of ϕ cE ≈ 20 % ( see Experimental and Computational Methods for details on calculation of ϕ cE ) . At room temperature , crowding conditions result in conformational changes of the protein that eventually decrease the donor – acceptor distance when more crowder is added . As a first control , we measured the D / A ratio as a function of sucrose concentration . We observed that D / A was almost con - stant over the entire range from 0 – 300 mg ∕ ml ( see SI Appendix ) , thus showing that Ficoll indeed induces compact states of PGK through macromolecular crowding and not through protein – carbohydrate nonspecific interactions . As a second control , we measured the intrinsic response of the AcGFP1 and mCherry fluorophores ( open triangles in Fig . 2 A ) as a function of Ficoll concentration . For this purpose , we excited donor ( green ) fluor - escence of an AcGFP1 - PGK construct and acceptor ( red ) fluor - escence of the AcGFP1 - PGK - mCherry construct by exciting mCherry directly . D / A is nearly crowding - independent ( Fig . 2 A ) and cannot account for the compact states of PGK observed at high crowder concentration . Protein Stability as a Function of Crowding . Upon Ficoll crowding , the stability of PGK construct increases , in agreement with pre - dictions made previously ( 13 ) and also subsequent experiments on other proteins ( 19 ) . In aqueous buffer , the construct had a melting temperature of T m ¼ 39 °C ( see Experimental and Computational Methods ) . T m increased slightly with crowder con - centration ( Fig . 2 C ) . The maximum crowder concentration for the higher temperature experiments was 200 mg ∕ ml ( ϕ cE ≈ 13 % volume fraction ) to avoid aggregation of the construct . However , addition of sucrose also results in significant thermodynamic stabilization ( see Fig . S1 ) , indicating that thermodynamic stabi - lization caused by macromolecular crowding is modest . Thermal titrations up to 50 °C were > 90 % reversible to the room tempera - ture signal in aqueous , sucrose , and Ficoll solutions . Enzymatic Activity Increases with Crowding . As seen in Table 1 , enzymatic activity of wild - type PGK increases about fivefold when the Ficoll concentration is raised to 100 mg ∕ ml , and even more at 200 mg ∕ ml . Ordinarily , the increased viscosity of the Ficoll solution should slow down the catalytic rate . If the viscosity increase is taken into account ( Table 1 ) , the net increase in ac - tivity is over 12 - fold at 100 mg ∕ ml , and even higher at 200 mg ∕ ml of Ficoll ( ϕ cE ≈ 13 % ) . The FRET - labeled PGK yields similar results . Enzymatic activity is similar compared to the wild type ( Table 1 ) in aqueous solution .

If one includes the effect of slower substrate diffusion in the viscous crowding matrix ( Table 1 ) , the activity increase is actually enhanced over sixfold in 100 mg ∕ ml Ficoll , and over 15 - fold in 200 mg ∕ ml Ficoll . These increases in activity are much greater than the < 2 - fold changes usually ob - served upon addition of osmolytes or crowders ( 20 ) to enzyme solutions , another indication of a larger structural change . A control experiment in 100 mg ∕ ml sucrose simply resulted in a reduction of enzymatic activity ( see Fig . S2 ) , as expected at the higher viscosity . Thus , the enhancement of activity in Ficoll goes hand - in - hand with the more compact structure detected by FRET upon macromolecular crowding , in contrast to sucrose ( Fig . S1 ) , and detected by simulations below . Chevron Plot of Relaxation Time vs . Crowder Concentration . The PGK relaxation rate is maximized at a well - defined crowder concentration . The AcGFP1 - PGK - mCherry construct was laser temperature jumped from 39 . 8 (cid:1) 0 . 5 to 44 . 0 (cid:1) 0 . 5 °C at several crowder concentrations . When relaxation is measured by tem - perature jumps to 44 °C , the unfolding rate is weighted slightly more than the folding rate in the observed relaxation rate because T m ranged from 39 to 40 . 5 °C . The relaxation time vs . crowder concentration is a “ chevron ” plot ( Fig . 2 B ) . The fastest relaxation is observed at 100 mg ∕ ml Ficoll concentration . In contrast , the relaxation rate in sucrose decreases monotonically with increas - ing concentration ( see SI Appendix ) . Addition of sucrose only results in increased viscosity , not in any crowding effect . Folding Energy Landscape of PGKinSilicoChanges upon Crowding . In order to investigate the stability and structure of PGK , we calcu - lated the free energy landscapes of PGK . We identified four states : C ( crystal structure ) , CC ( collapsed crystal structure ) , Sph ( spherical compact state ) , and U ( thermally denatured state ) . The structures of these states are discussed in detail in the next subsection . In Fig . 3 we plot the ensemble populations as a func - tion of volume fraction of crowders ( ϕ c ¼ 0 – 40 % ) and tempera - ture ( 0 . 9 to 1 . 47 k B T ∕ ε ) using structural similarity χ ( χ equals 0 for the crystal structure , 1 for highly dissimilar structures ) ( 21 ) and radius of gyration R g as the order parameters characterizing the energy landscape of PGK . At low temperature and in the absence of crowders , the C and CC states are populated ( Fig . 3 A ) . As ϕ c increases , the popula - tion of the C states reduces . At ϕ c ¼ 25 % , CC and Sph are both populated , while the population of C is significantly destabilized by approximately 4 k B T ( Fig . 3 D ) . Finally , at the highest crowding ( ϕ c ¼ 40 % ) , the Sph structure prevails . ( Fig . 3 G ) . When the temperature is increased from k B T ∕ ε ¼ 0 . 9 to k B T ∕ ε ¼ 1 . 17 ( ε is the solvent - mediated interaction ; see SI Appendix for details ) , the CC and Sph structures become extensively populated even in the absence of crowding ( Fig . 3 B ) , and the Sph structure dominates under crowded conditions ( Fig . 3 E and H ) . Finally , at the highest temperature , the unfolded state dominates under all crowding conditions . Structural Characteristics of Compact PGK States inSilico . We char - acterized the coarse - grained structural properties of PGK with four parameters ( see Experimental and Computational Methods ) : structural similarity χ , radius of gyration R g , asphericity Δ ( Δ ¼ 0 is sphere , Δ ¼ 1 is rod ) and shape parameter S ( S ¼ − 0 . 25 is oblate , S ¼ 2 is prolate ) . The crystal structure ensemble C had 0 . 05 ≤ χ ≤ 0 . 18 and 22 . 0 Å ≤ R g ≤ 24 . 0 Å . The collapsed crystal structure CC state had higher χ values but smaller R g ( 0 . 16 ≤ χ ≤ 0 . 26 and 20 . 0 Å ≤ R g ≤ 21 . 5 Å ) than the C state . The calculation of shape and asphericity parameters for the CC structure ( S ¼ 0 . 05 and Δ ¼ 0 . 1 ) demonstrated a dramatic shape change to a closed compact state from the open crystal state ( S ¼ 0 . 26 and Δ ¼ 0 . 26 ) . Furthermore , at a higher tempera - ture or crowding level the Sph state appears with greater values of χ ( 0 . 3 ≤ χ ≤ 0 . 36 and 20 . 0 Å ≤ R g ≤ 21 . 5 Å ) . The ensemble structures from the Sph state are characterized by S ¼ 0 . 01 and Δ ¼ 0 . 02 , revealing a spherical nature of this state . To better illustrate the structural differences among ensemble conformations of PGK in atomistic detail , we reconstructed the coarse - grained protein models of the C , CC , and Sph states into all - atomistic protein models using the reconstruction algo - rithm SCAAL ( side chain − C α to all - atom ) ( 15 , 22 ) ( Fig . 4 A – C ) . In the C state , the two subunits are split wide apart as in an open “ pacman ” form . In the CC state , the cleft between the two sub - units , a space accommodating the two substrates of PGK , closes , resembling a closed “ pacman . ” The Sph state is formed by a major rearrangement of the two subunits over the hinge that in - volves twisting one of the two subunits with respect to the other , leaving at least one of the binding sites exposed to solvent . In order to investigate the domain rearrangement in the Sph state in detail , we calculated the orientation between the N and C domains of PGK by measuring an angle ( θ ) formed by two representative vectors . Two vectors were defined , one on each domain , that are parallel in the crystal structure , and these were used to assess the relative orientation of the two domains ( see SI Appendix for details ) . The calculation reveals that in the ensemble of the crystal state ( C ) θ is 0° ( cos θ ° ¼ 1 represents that the two vectors are in parallel ) as shown in Fig . S3 A and C . How - ever , in the ensemble of the Sph state , θ between the two vectors is centered around 180° ( cos θ ¼ − 1 ) as shown in Fig . S3 B and D , representing the alignment of two domains is nearly antiparallel . This result suggests a twist bending motion in the Sph state of PGK involving a significant rearrangement of the protein ’ s lobes under high crowding conditions . The domain rearrangement can also be demonstrated by the gain or loss of contact formation , in the form of a contact map , in the C , CC , and Sph states characterized from the respective ensembles in Fig . S4 .

InSilicoInvestigation of the N – C Termini Distance . The D / A ratios from the FRET - labeled construct correlate with the N – C termini distribution . The experiments demonstrated a strong decrease of D / A with increasing Ficoll concentration , indicating the existence of at least two types of PGK conformations in the pre - sence of crowders . These observations prompted us to compute the distance between the N and C termini ( D N - C ) for the three populated states ( C , CC , and Sph ) of PGK from computer simu - lations . D N - C is defined as the distance between the C α beads of residues Ser - 1 and Lys - 415 . Fig . 4 D reveals the distinctive profile of the N – C distance ( D N - C ) distribution for each compact structure taken from the crowding / temperature ensembles where it dominates . The CC state has the highest average D N - C , followed by the C and Sph states . In addition , the D N - C distribution of the CC state is by far the broadest , ranging from 5 Å to 50 Å . The reason for this wide distribution profile as well as high average is the greater mo - bility of the N and C termini , which are outwardly protruded when the protein ’ s hinge is bent . In contrast , in the Sph state in which the two domains are twisted against each other , the N and C termini residues are found in the interior of the protein , thus significantly reducing the distribution and the average of D N - C . InSilicoInvestigation of the Mg - ATP / 3PGA Binding Sites . The effect of crowding on the structure of PGK pertinent to its enzymatic activity can be indicated by the spatial distance D b between the ATP and 3PGA binding sites . The two binding sites are located separately at the inner surfaces of the N and C subunits , and it is postulated that the closure of this cleft , bringing the two sites together , is necessary for an active enzymatic reaction ( 3 , 23 ) . Fig . 5 shows the D b distribution of the three ensemble structures , C , CC , and Sph . For the crystal structure ensemble ( C ) , which dominates the population only in the absence of Ficoll 70 ( ϕ c ¼ 0 ) , D b is centered at 21 . 5 Å . For the CC state ensemble , which is prominent at ϕ c ¼ 25 % , the most probable D b is dras - tically reduced to 12 . 54 Å . Lastly , for the spherical state ensemble Sph ϕ c ¼ 40 % , the D b distribution is centered at 16 . 41 Å , still shorter than the most probable D b in the C state . Discussion Despite numerous studies of PGK ’ s folding stability and dynamics ( 24 – 26 ) and the motion of its flexible hinge , by experi - ment ( 27 ) as well as by computation ( 28 , 29 ) , it remains an open question to what extent the highly crowded environment can af - fect the PGK folding and structure and , ultimately , its enzymatic activity involving large - scale structural movement inside a cell . Although experimental studies using synthetic crowding agents have shown that the folding properties and enzymatic activity of simple proteins can be perturbed ( 30 ) , our study shows that crowding leads to major conformational changes of PGK , with a major impact on its enzymatic activity . The tethers labeling PGK are too short to allow the donor – acceptor fluorescence ratio D / A to change by nearly a factor of 2 while PGK remains open , and the individual fluorophore controls reveal no intrinsic crowding dependence of D / A due to changing quantum yields ( Fig . 2 A ) . The D / A ratio observed in our experiments decreases rapidly with increasing Ficoll concentration , showing that the two subunits of PGK close in on each other upon being placed in a crowded environment . The observed D / A values correspond to the existence of at least two states of PGK and possibly a third state ( resulting in a lag of D / A below 50 mg ∕ ml ) . Our experimental interpretation is entirely consistent with the coarse - grained molecular simulations , which reveal three compact ensemble structures of PGK below its folding tempera - ture . The lag and decrease of the D / A ratio with increased crowding may be explained by a progression of PGK through C , CC , and Sph states . In Fig . 3 A , D , and G the most probable PGK state is the C state at ϕ c ¼ 0 , the CC state at ϕ c ¼ 25 % , and the Sph state at ϕ c ¼ 40 % . The corresponding average N - to C - terminal distance of the C , CC , and Sph states is D N - C ∼ 19 Å , ∼ 25 Å , and ∼ 14 Å , respectively . This nonmonotonic trend of D N - C is in qualitative agreement with the FRET results : a lag phase ( or slight increase ) of D / A from 0 – 50 mg ∕ ml Ficoll , then a strong decrease of D / A . Crowding dramatically increases PGK activity , as demon - strated by an over 15 - fold increase in viscosity - adjusted enzymatic activity of the construct . The increase is even more dramatic for wild type yeast PGK ( without FRET labels ) ( Table 1 ) . Com - plementary structural analysis of the compact PGK ensembles observed in the computer simulations reveals that the CC and Sph states indeed bring the two catalytic sites closer together ( Fig . 5 ) . The binding sites of the CC ensemble are intact after PGK undergoes large structural changes while the binding sites in the Sph ensemble are rearranged . We suggest that , although the distance between the binding sites is reduced in both CC and Sph states , the CC states whose binding sites are structurally intact may be the most biochemically active . The additional activity of wild - type unlabeled PGK may be due to stabilization of CC compared to Sph , relative to the fluorescence - labeled triple mutant . Our folding kinetics experiments show that domain collapse is not the only large amplitude motion affected by crowding . The measured folding kinetics vary nonmonotonically with crow - der concentration , leading to a chevron - like plot with a maximal folding rate observed at a Ficoll concentration of 100 mg ∕ ml ( Fig . 2 B ) . Below and above this concentration , the folding / unfolding relaxation time increases . Models of macromolecular crowding have predicted an initial increase in the relaxation rate as crowder concentration is increased , followed by a decrease at even higher crowder concentrations .

Chemical and crowd - ing effects can obviously compete with one another , but in the case of PGK , simple crowding can explain all the observations ( 31 ) . In summary , we have shown that macromolecular crowding profoundly affects the structure of PGK , resulting in the forma - tion of more compact and enzymatically more active structures . This has far - reaching implications , despite Ficoll 70 still being a cytomimetic material and lacking the polydisperse nature of a cell ( 32 ) — it suggests that in the crowded interior of a living cell , hinge - bending motions may not be necessary for PGK to carry out its function . Instead , the nucleotide and 1 , 3 - DPG binding domains may already be in close proximity to each other for efficient catalysis to occur . Finally , we showed that macromo - lecular crowding and viscosity compete with each other , result - ing in a uniquely defined concentration at which PGK folding is fastest . A speedup of folding upon crowding was also observed for lysozyme ’ s “ prompt ” folding phase ( 33 ) ( the one relevant here because PGK has no disulfide bridges ) . Our combined experimental and computational effort high - lights the importance of in vivo studies ( 34 ) in addition to crystal - lographic structure - function relationships and in vitro studies . The states in which PGK protein exists under crowding condi - tions have structural and kinetic characteristics very different from the state in dilute aqueous buffer ( 35 ) or in the crystal . This could turn out to be a general phenomenon for multisubunit ( 36 – 38 ) or partly unstructured proteins : the structural character - istics of the so - called “ native state ( s ) ” and how rapidly they fold or unfold will depend sensitively on the nature of their surround - ing crowding conditions . Experimental and Computational Methods Protein Design and Expression . We designed a fusion protein consisting of a low - melting mutant ( Y122W / W308F / W333F ) of phosphoglycerate kinase ( PGK ) ( 24 ) , fused between a Green Fluorescent Protein ( AcGFP1 ) donor ( D ) and an mCherry accep - tor ( A ) . AcGFP1 and mCherry are connected to the N and C termini by amino acid linkers consisting of two amino acids each . Unfolding of this protein leads to an increase in the N – C terminal distance , resulting in an increase in donor to acceptor fluores - cence ratio ( D / A ) due to decrease in energy transfer by Förster resonance energy transfer . We expressed the fusion protein in E . coli and purified the construct on a Ni - NTA column as de - scribed previously ( 35 ) . A fusion protein consisting of AcGFP1 tagged to the N terminus of PGK was expressed and purified as described above . Stability and Kinetics of Crowded Phosphoglycerate Kinase . For both thermodynamic and kinetic measurements , the protein solution was sandwiched between a cover slip and microscope slide by a 100 μ m spacer , resulting in a column density of about 1 ; 000 proteins ∕ μ m 2 . This low density avoids protein – protein interactions while providing sufficient fluorescence for good detection sensitivity with a N / A 0 . 65 objective in an inverted fluorescence microscope . Equilibrium titrations were performed by resistive heating of the microscope stage . Temperature was detected by mCherry fluorescence excited at 532 nm , which decreases as temperature increases , and independently calibrated by thermocouples below and above the sample slide . Measuring the equilibrium D / A ratio as a function of temperature yielded protein unfolding curves that were fitted to a sigmoidal model with a linear tem - perature dependence : K eff ¼ e − Δ G ∕ RT ; Δ G ¼ Δ g 1 ð T − T m Þ [ 1 ] The equilibrium constant is an effective equilibrium constant because PGK is known not to be a two - state folder . We analyzed the melting temperature T m and the cooperativity parameter Δ g 1 ( negentropy , or first derivative of the free energy at T m ) of the unfolding transition in aqueous solution up to Ficoll concentrations of 200 mg ∕ ml . Δ g 1 from Eq . 1 was fitted to 1 . 07 (cid:1) 0 . 16 kJ ∕ mole ∕ °C . The measurement uncertainty was too large to discern a trend ( Fig . 2 D ) . The AcGFP1 and mCherry melting points exceed 70 °C , so the observed transition corre - sponds to melting of the PGK within the construct . Concentra - tions greater than 200 mg ∕ ml resulted in PGK aggregation at the higher temperatures . 200 mg ∕ ml corresponds to a volume fraction of approximately ϕ cE ≈ 13 % . Thermodynamic measure - ments in sucrose ( Fisher Scientific ) were possible up to a concen - tration of 150 mg ∕ ml ; at higher concentrations , the protein started aggregating before yielding a denatured baseline , thus precluding determination of the melting temperature and effec - tive cooperativity . Experimental volume fractions of Ficoll 70 ( ϕ cE ) were calcu - lated using the partial specific volume of Ficoll , which is 0 . 67 ml ∕ g ( 39 ) . We used Ficoll with an average molecular mass of 70 kDa from Sigma - Aldrich . The highest volume fraction achievable in our experiments was ϕ cE ≈ 20 % , while the simula - tions ( see below ) were carried out at ϕ c ¼ 0 % , 25 % , and 40 % , thus allowing us to qualitatively compare the experimental results with the computer simulations . Relaxation kinetics were induced by temperature jumps and monitored with 17 ms time - resolution for 15 s . A tailored mid - IR pulse ( λ ¼ 2 ; 200 nm ) emitted by a diode laser jumped up the temperature of the protein solution from 39 °C to 43 °C , across the thermal unfolding transition . The key advantage of using a programmable diode laser is that the temperature profile can be adjusted to a step function , so the temperature after the jump is constant to within (cid:1) 0 . 25 °C . No sample recooling and backward relaxation occurs . The kinetics were described by a stretched - exponential signal of the form S ð t Þ ∼ e − ð t ∕ τ Þ β , which has been used previously to describe folding kinetics of several PGK mutants P r obab ili t y den s i t y D b ( Å ) C CC Sph 5 10 15 20 25 30 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 Fig . 5 .

The Mg - ATP and 3PG binding sites are colored in yellow and green representations of van der Waals spheres , respectively . Atomistic structures were reconstructed from coarse - grained protein models using SCAAL . 17590 ∣ www . pnas . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1073 / pnas . 1006760107 Dhar et al . ( 24 , 40 ) . The hierarchical stretched - exponential description or “ strange kinetics ” provides a convenient way of summarizing the intermediate stages of folding with a single parameter β . The precision of the stretched - exponential fits for the time constant τ was (cid:1) 0 . 01 s , while the error bar in Fig . 2 B shows the accuracy of our kinetics measurements based on repeated measurement . PGK Activity Assay . We measured PGK activity using the coupled reaction with glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase from the previous step of the glycolytic pathway , as described in detail earlier . NADH consumption was monitored as a function of time by following the absorbance at 340 nm . The rate of NADH consumption was measured at various concentrations of the substrate 3 - phosphoglycerate and plotted as a function of sub - strate concentration to extract the enzyme activity . For purposes of comparison , we assayed the activity of wild - type PGK without any labels . Wild - type PGK and all chemicals required for the assay were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich . Simulation Details . The coarse - grained models of PGK proteins , as well as the simulation methods , are provided in the SI Appendix . The thermodynamic properties of PGK were studied at the volume fractions of crowder Ficoll 70 ϕ c ¼ 0 % , ϕ c ¼ 25 % , and ϕ c ¼ 40 % by coarse - grained molecular simulation ( by conven - tion , the volume fraction of crowders is presented as a percentage of total volume ; i . e . , ϕ c ¼ 25 % corresponds to 0 . 25 of the total volume ) . Several represented coarse - grained structures were reconstructed to all - atomistic protein models for illustration by using SCAAL ( 15 , 22 ) . Structural Characterization of PGK . To analyze the structural char - acteristics of PGK , we used four parameters : ( i ) Overlap function χ is to measure the structural similarity to the crystal structure ( 21 ) . χ equals 0 for the crystal structure , 1 for highly dissimilar structures . ( ii ) The radius of gyration R g is to measure the size of PGK . ( iii ) Asphericity S and ( iv ) shape parameters Δ are cal - culated from the inertia tensor ( 15 ) . S lies between − 0 . 25 ( oblate ellipsoid ) and 2 ( prolate ellipsoid ) . Δ lies between 0 ( sphere ) and 1 ( rod ) . For a sphere , S and Δ are equal to zero . Binding Sites Distance Calculation . To calculate the distance be - tween the Mg - ATP and 3PGA binding sites in the characteristic structures of PGK we defined D b to be the distance between the centers of mass of the amino acid residues involved in the two substrate binding sites . The selection of Mg - ATP binding site residues were obtained from ref . 1 ) , while the residues that bind 3PGA were taken from ref . 23 ) . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS .
