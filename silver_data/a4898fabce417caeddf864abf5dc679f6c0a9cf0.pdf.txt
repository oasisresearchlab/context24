We re - port that Coronin 1B interacts simultaneously with Arp2 / 3 complex and Slingshot ( SSH1L ) phosphatase , two regulators of actin ﬁlament formation and turnover , respectively . Coronin 1B inhibits ﬁlament nucleation by Arp2 / 3 com - plex and this inhibition is attenuated by phos - phorylation of Coronin 1B at Serine 2 , a site targeted by SSH1L . Coronin 1B also directs SSH1L to lamellipodia where SSH1L likely regu - lates Coﬁlin activity via dephosphorylation . Accordingly , depleting Coronin 1B increases phospho - Coﬁlin levels , and alters lamellipodial dynamics and actin ﬁlament architecture at the leading edge . We conclude that Coronin 1B’s coordination of ﬁlament formation by Arp2 / 3 complex and ﬁlament turnover by Coﬁlin is required for effective lamellipodial protrusion and cell migration . INTRODUCTION Coronins are highly - conserved F - actin binding proteins ( Uetrecht and Bear , 2006 ) . Functional studies in Dicytoste - lium amoeba , ﬁbroblasts and thymocytes indicate that Coronins play an important role in lamellipodial protrusion , whole - cell motility and chemotaxis ( Cai et al . , 2005 ; de Hostos et al . , 1993 ; Foger et al . , 2006 ; Mishima and Nish - ida , 1999 ) , but the mechanism ( s ) by which Coronins inﬂu - ence motility are unknown . In yeast , one mechanism may be through inhibition of Arp2 / 3 complex ( Humphries et al . , 2002 ; Rodal et al . , 2005 ) , but the effects of mammalian Coronins on actin nucleation activity by Arp 2 / 3 complex are unknown . Mammalian Coronin 1B is ubiquitously ex - pressed and localizes to the leading edge of migrating ﬁbroblasts ( Cai et al . , 2005 ) . The interactions of Coronin 1B or Coronin 1A with Arp2 / 3 complex are regulated by phosphorylation of Serine 2 via PKC , where phosphoryla - tion of Ser2 reduced the interaction with Arp2 / 3 and dimin - ished cell motility ( Cai et al . , 2005 ; Foger et al . , 2006 ) . ADF / Coﬁlin proteins ( hereafter referred to as Coﬁlin ) control actin ﬁlament turnover at the leading edge and at other cellular locations ( Bamburg , 1999 ) . Mechanistically , Coﬁlin severs and potentially enhances depolymerization of ﬁlaments by cooperatively binding along the sides of actin ﬁlaments and inducing conformational changes in ﬁlament structure ( Bamburg et al . , 1999 ) . In vivo , Coﬁlin regulates the dynamics of actin - based structures such as stress ﬁbers , dendritic spines and lamellipodia ( Dawe et al . , 2003 ; Hotulainen et al . , 2005 ; Zhou et al . , 2004 ) . The activity of Coﬁlin is regulated in a variety of ways including phosphorylation , PIP 2 binding , intracellular pH changes and interactions with binding partners such as AIP1 ( Bamburg , 1999 ) . Phosphorylation of Coﬁlin - serine 3 by LIM Kinase or TESK leads to decreased F - actin binding and inactivation of Coﬁlin ( Stanyon and Bernard , 1999 ) . Dephosphoryla - tion of Serine 3 on Coﬁlin enhances F - actin binding and activates its severing / depolymerization activity ( Agnew et al . , 1995 ) . Two classes of phosphatases act on Coﬁlin - the Slingshots and Chronophin ( Huang et al . , 2006 ) . Slingshot is a family of atypical Serine / Threonine protein phosphatases that in mammals includes Slingshot - 1 , - 2 and - 3 ; Slingshot - 1 and - 2 exist as long and short isoforms ( Niwa et al . , 2002 ; Ohta et al . , 2003 ) . The long isoform of Slingshot - 1 ( SSH1L ) functions during chemotaxis of hem - atopoeitic cells ( Nishita et al . , 2005 ) . Regulation of SSH1L activity may occur via phosphorylation of serine residues in its C terminus and binding of inhibitory 14 - 3 - 3 proteins ( Nagata - Ohashi et al . , 2004 ) . In addition , SSH1L activity is greatly enhanced by its interaction with F - actin ( Nagata - Ohashi et al . , 2004 ; Soosairajah et al . , 2005 ) . The other known Coﬁlin phosphatase , Chronophin , is a HAD - type serine phosphatase that plays an important role in cytoki - nesis ( Gohla et al . , 2005 ) . Cell 128 , 915 – 929 , March 9 , 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . 915 Considerable evidence suggests that the activities of Arp2 / 3 complex and Coﬁlin are coordinately regulated at the leading edge of motile cells . Studies using correlative microscopy ( Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) suggest an array treadmilling model for actin assembly and turnover within lamellipodia in which Arp2 / 3 - dependent ﬁlament nucle - ation at the front of the lamellipodia was balanced by Coﬁlin - dependent depolymerization of ﬁlaments at the rear . Arp2 / 3 complex and Coﬁlin also work together to promote lamellipodial protrusion in quiescent adenocarci - noma cells stimulated with growth factors , albeit via a dif - ferent mechanism ( DesMarais et al . , 2005 ) . MTLn3 cells stimulated with EGF initiate protrusion when Coﬁlin severs ﬁlaments creating new barbed ends that are preferred sites for Arp2 / 3 - dependent ﬁlament nucleation ( Ichetovkin et al . , 2002 ) . Together , ﬁlament severing and ﬁlament nu - cleation synergize to produce a burst of new barbed ends at the leading edge that support lamellipodial protrusion ( DesMarais et al . , 2004 ) . Finally , studies using quantitative ﬂuorescent speckle microscopy in epithelial cells suggest that Arp2 / 3 complex and Coﬁlin activities within lamellipo - dia may be coupled ( Ponti et al . , 2005 ) , but very little is known about how this occurs . In this work , we describe a molecular connection between the Arp2 / 3 complex and Coﬁlin activities at the leading edge of motile cells that involves Coronin 1B . RESULTS Depletion of Coronin 1B Reduces Whole - Cell Motility and Modulates Lamellipodial Dynamics To test the role of Coronin 1B in motility , we depleted Co - ronin 1B in Rat2 cells and monitored the effects on whole - cell migration and lamellipodial dynamics . An shRNA that selectively targets mouse and rat , but not human , Coronin 1B ( Figures 1A and 1B ) decreased the level of Coronin 1B in mouse or rat cells ( Figures 1C and 4J ) ( Rubinson et al . , 2003 ) . Depletion of Coronin 1B leads to (cid:2) 33 % decrease in cell speed relative to uninfected cells , cells infected with a control shRNA ( NS ) or cells expressing the Coronin 1B shRNA and human Coronin 1B - GFP that is refractory to the shRNA ( Figure 1D ) . Since the decreased rate of cell motility was rescued by expressing human Coronin 1B - GFP , this effect is speciﬁcally due to loss of Coronin 1B and not off - target silencing . Thus , Coronin 1B is required for normal whole - cell motility . Since Coronin 1B is concentrated at the leading edge ( Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this ar - ticle online ) , we reasoned that the effects of Coronin 1B depletion on whole - cell motility might arise from defects in lamellipodial dynamics . We used kymography to quan - tify the effects of Coronin 1B depletion on lamellipodial dynamics ( Figure 1E ) . Three parameters of lamellipodial behavior were analyzed : protrusion rate , protrusion persistence and protrusion distance ( Hinz et al . , 1999 ) . Depletion of Coronin 1B increased the protrusion rate and decreased the protrusion persistence and the dis - tance protruded ( Figure 1F ) . Thus , Coronin 1B modulates lamellipodial dynamics , but is not absolutely required for protrusions to form . Depletion of Coronin 1B Slows Retrograde Actin Flow , Inﬂuences Barbed End Distribution and Density , and Inﬂuences Actin Architecture at the Leading Edge The assembly and disassembly of actin ﬁlament networks underlie the dynamic behavior of lamellipodia . Since Coronin 1B depletion affects lamellipodia and Coronins bind F - actin , we tested if Coronin 1B depletion affects ac - tin dynamics at the leading edge . The network of actin ﬁl - aments assembling at the cell margin moves rearwards toward the cell body via retrograde ﬂow . Using kymogra - phy of cells expressing GFP - actin to visualize actin , the rate of retrograde actin ﬂow in Coronin 1B - depleted cells was reduced to (cid:2) 50 % the rate in control cells ( Figures 2A and 2B ) , supporting the idea that Coronin 1B modu - lates the dynamics of the actin network at the leading edge . A zone of rapidly growing ﬁlament barbed ends is a hall - mark of the actin network at the leading edge ( Condeelis et al . , 1988 ) . To measure the distribution and density of barbed ends in Coronin 1B depleted cells , we used an es - tablished assay to monitor barbed ends in situ ( Symons and Mitchison , 1991 ) . Depletion of Coronin 1B leads to a striking narrowing of the zone of barbed ends near the cell edge compared to control cells ( Figures 2C and 2D ) . In addition to altering the spatial distribution of barbed ends , Coronin 1B depletion increased the density of barbed ends relative to total F - actin ( Figure 2E ) . Thus , Coronin 1B inhibits the generation of barbed ends at the leading edge and alters their spatial distribution . To examine the underlying actin ﬁlament architecture at the leading edge of Coronin 1B depleted cells , we used platinum replica electron microscopy . Rat2 cells have a robust and uniform dendritic network of actin ﬁlaments at the leading edge that is approximately 2 m m wide ( Figure 2F ) . Cells depleted of Coronin 1B have an abnor - mal actin network characterized by densely branched ﬁlaments at the cell margin and a relative paucity of actin ﬁlaments at the rear of the lamellipodium ( Figure 2F ) . These changes in the organization of actin ﬁlaments are not observed in cells expressing a control shRNA or in Coronin 1B - depleted cells rescued with human Coronin 1B - GFP ( Figure S3 ) . Thus , Coronin 1B appears to plays a role in coordinating assembly of actin ﬁlaments at the cell edge and disassembly of actin ﬁlaments at the rear of the lamellipodium . Coronin 1B Inhibits Arp2 / 3 Complex Activity in a Phosphorylation - Dependent Manner Yeast Coronin inhibits actin ﬁlament nucleation by Arp2 / 3 complex in vitro ( Humphries et al . , 2002 ) . To determine if human Coronin 1B inhibits Arp2 / 3 complex nucleation ac - tivity , we added recombinant Coronin 1B to pyrenyl actin polymerization reactions . Coronin 1B had no effect on the rates of spontaneous actin assembly or of assembly 916 Cell 128 , 915 – 929 , March 9 , 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . nucleated from Spectrin - F - actin seeds ( Figure S6 ) . How - ever , in reactions containing Coronin 1B and GST - VCA - activated Arp2 / 3 complex , the rate of actin polymerization was reduced ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . To determine if phos - phorylation at Ser2 regulates Coronin 1B’s inhibition of Arp2 / 3 complex , we compared wild - type Coronin 1B ( WT ) , phosphorylated Coronin 1B ( p - WT ) and a phospho - mimetic S2D mutant of Coronin 1B . In contrast to WT Coronin 1B , phosphorylated Coronin 1B ( p - WT ) and the S2D mutant Coronin 1B weakly inhibit Arp2 / 3 complex nu - cleation activity at all doses tested ( Figures 3B and S7 ) . Furthermore , puriﬁed Arp2 / 3 complex bound directly to wild - type Coronin 1B , but did not bind to the phosphomi - metic S2D Coronin 1B mutant ( Figure 3C ) . Thus , Coronin Figure 1 .

Coronin 1B Is Dephosphorylated by an Okadiac Acid - Insensitive Phosphatase The phosphatase that dephosphorylates and activates Coronin 1B is unknown . To identify this Coronin 1B phos - phatase , we developed an assay in which cells were ﬁrst treated with PMA to stimulate maximal phosphorylation , followed by PMA washout in the presence of a pan - PKC inhibitor ( Ro32 - 0432 ) to block further phosphorylation . Using this regime , dephosphorylation of Coronin 1B was detected within one minute and phospho - Coronin 1B re - turned to basal levels by 10 min ( Figure 4A ) .

Okadaic acid at concentra - tions from 100 nM ( Figure 4B ) to 1 m M ( data not shown ) had no effect on the rate of Coronin 1B dephosphoryla - tion , making it unlikely that phospho - Coronin 1B is a sub - strate of either PP1 or PP2A . Coronin 1B Is a Substrate of the Slingshot - 1L Phosphatase We considered whether the Coronin 1B phosphatase might be Slingshot , which acts on Coﬁlin . Slingshots are among a small number of Ser / Thr phosphatases resistant to okadaic acid ( Niwa et al . , 2002 ) . To test this hypothesis , we performed in vitro and in vivo dephosphorylation as - says using Slingshot - 1L ( SSH1L ) . Recombinant Coronin 1B phosphorylated in vitro with puriﬁed PKC a was efﬁ - ciently dephosphorylated by SSH1L ( Figure 4C ) . Since phosphatases often exhibit promiscuous activity on puri - ﬁed proteins , we tested whether SSH1L dephosphory - lates Coronin 1B in cell lysates . Coronin 1B was phosphor - ylated by stimulating cells with PMA prior to lysis and increasing amounts of SSH1L - myc were then added ; the phosphorylation status of Coronin 1B and other sub - strates was monitored by immunoblotting . Coronin 1B was dephosphorylated by SSH1L in a dose - dependent manner ( Figure 4D ) . Coﬁlin was also efﬁciently dephos - phorylated and may be a preferred substrate . In contrast , no detectable dephosphorylation of phospho - Erk1 / 2 or phospho - Paxillin was detected , suggesting that the SSH1L phosphatase activity is highly speciﬁc under these conditions . To determine if Coronin 1B is a substrate of SSH1L in vivo , we performed dephosphorylation assays in two different cell types . First , HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with dominant negative mutant form of SSH1L ( SSH1L - CS ) , which harbors a mutation ( C393S ) in the phosphatase domain that renders it catalytically in - active ( Ohta et al . , 2003 ) . In the presence of SSH1L - CS , phospho - Coronin 1B was elevated after PMA stimulation and the return to basal levels after washing out PMA was delayed ( Figure 4E ) . Since ectopic SSH1L expression is relatively high in HEK293 cells , we conﬁrmed these ob - servations using Rat2 cells stably expressing lower levels of either wild - type ( WT ) SSH1L - GFP or dominant negative SSH1L - CS - GFP ( Figure 4F ) . As expected , the level of phosopho - Coﬁlin decreased in lysates from Rat2 cells ex - pressing WT SSH1L - GFP and increased in lysates from Rat2 cells expressing CS SSH1L - GFP . We conclude that , like Coﬁlin , Coronin 1B is a substrate of the SSH1L phosphatase in vitro and in vivo . Coronin 1B , Slingshot 1L , and Arp2 / 3 Form a Complex In Vivo that Is Bridged by Coronin 1B Coronin 1B and Arp2 / 3 complex interact in vivo ( Cai et al . , 2005 ) . To determine if Slingshot 1L is part of this complex , we immunoprecipitated SSH1L and probed for Coronin 1B and Arp2 / 3 complex . SSH1L - myc interacted with en - dogenous Coronin 1B using reciprocal coimmunoprecipi - tations ( Figure 4H ) . Arp2 / 3 complex ( as reported by the p34 subunit ) was detected in both the Coronin 1B and SSH1L immunoprecipitates . Notably , actin was not de - tected , despite the fact that Coronin 1B , SSH1L and Arp2 / 3 complex all bind F - actin , indicating that the inter - action among these components is not bridged by resid - ual F - actin . While these results are consistent with the existence of a ternary complex containing Coronin 1B , SSH1L and Arp2 / 3 complex , they do not exclude the possibility of two bivalent complexes ( a Coronin 1B - Arp2 / 3 complex and a SSH1L - Arp2 / 3 complex ) . To identify a ternary com - plex , we used a two - step immunoprecipitation protocol in which Coronin 1B was ﬁrst immuno - depleted from the ly - sates derived from Rat2 : SSH1L - GFP cells followed by a second immunoprecipitation of SSH1L - GFP from the depleted lysate ( Figure 4I ) . In the ﬁrst step , anti - Coronin 1B ( but not control IgG ) immunoprecipitated both SSH1L - GFP and Arp2 / 3 complex . When SSH1L - GFP was immunoprecipitated from the Coronin 1B - depleted lysate , no additional Arp2 / 3 complex was coimmunopre - cipitated . In contrast , SSH1L - GFP coimmunoprecipitated both Coronin 1B and Arp2 / 3 complex from a mock - depleted lysate . To conﬁrm this result , we tested for an interaction between SSH1L and Arp2 / 3 complex in Coronin 1B - depleted cells . No SSH1L was detected when Arp2 / 3 complex was immunoprecipitated from lysates derived from Coronin 1B - depleted , SSH1L - GFP expressing Rat2 ( Figure 4J ) . We conclude that SSH1L , Coronin 1B and Arp2 / 3 exist in a ternary complex that is bridged by Coronin 1B . Depletion of Coronin 1B Inhibits SSH1L - Induced Membrane Rufﬂing Expression of SSH1L - GFP in Rat2 cells induces constitu - tive hyper - rufﬂing at the cell periphery ( Figure 5A ) . Lamel - lipodia in SSH1L - expressing cells protrude at approxi - mately twice the rate and protrusions are short - lived compared to control cells , with no difference in protrusion distance . Remarkably , depletion of Coronin 1B com - pletely suppressed SSH1L - induced hyper - rufﬂing . One possible explanation is that Coronin 1B generally inﬂu - ences lamellipodial dynamics by a mechanism unrelated to SSH1L activity . To address this possibility , we investi - gated lamellipodia in Coronin 1B - depleted cells express - ing FP4 - CAAX , which induces hyper - rufﬂing by targeting Ena / VASP proteins to the plasma membrane ( Bear et al . , 2000 , 2002 ) . As expected , expression of FP4 - CAAX increased protrusion rate and shortened protrusion per - sistence , similar to the effects of SSH1L expression , but ( J ) Rat2 cells expressing SSH1L - GFP were infected with lentivirus expressing Coronin 1B shRNA ( KD - 1B ) or a control shRNA ( NS ) . Arp2 / 3 complex was immunoprecipitated using anti - p34Arc and blotted for SSH1L using anti - GFP . Similar results were obtained using anti - GFP to immunoprecitate SSH1L - GFP ( data not shown ) . Cell 128 , 915 – 929 , March 9 , 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . 921 depletion of Coronin 1B had no effect on the rufﬂing induced by FP4 - CAAX . Thus , the suppression of the SSH1L - induced rufﬂing in Coronin 1B – depleted cells is a speciﬁc , rather than a general , effect on lamellipodial dynamics . Suppression of SSH1L - induced rufﬂing upon Coronin 1B depletion may occur via dephosphorylation of Coronin 1B by SSH1L . Thus , a phosphomimetic mutant form of Co - ronin 1B would be predicted to suppress SSH1L - induced hyper - rufﬂing by competing with endogenous substrates . To test this hypothesis , lamellipodial dynamics were exam - ined in cells expressing Coronin 1B S2D and SSH1L . To our surprise , the Coronin 1B S2D mutant is ineffective in suppressing SSH1L - induced hyper - rufﬂing ( Figure 5B ) . In contrast , expression of the phosphomimetic Coﬁlin S3D mutant suppresses SSH1L - induced hyper - rufﬂing ( Fig - ure 5B ) , conﬁrming that SSH1L - induced rufﬂing is due to the phosphatase activity of SSH1L . While these results do not preclude a contribution of SSH1L dephosphoryla - tion of Coronin 1B in regulating lamellipodial behavior , they do suggest that regulation of Coﬁlin by SSH1L inﬂu - ences lamellipodial behavior . Alternately , Coﬁlin S3D may be a more effective competitor of SSH1L phosphatase than Coronin 1B S2D . Nonetheless , we sought another explanation for the potent suppression of the ectopic SSH1L - induced rufﬂing upon Coronin 1B depletion . Figure 5 . Depletion of Coronin 1B Inhibits SSH1L - Induced Membrane Rufﬂing ( A ) Rat2 cells expressing SSH1L or FP 4 - CAAX were transfected with the Coronin 1B shRNA , and subjected to kymography analysis as described in Figure 1E . Newman - Keuls multiple comparison test was used after one - way ANOVA to generate the p values ; error bars represent 95 % CI . ( B ) Phosphomimetic mutants of either Coronin 1B ( S2D ) or Coﬁlin ( S3D ) were coexpressed in Rat2 cells with SSH1L - GFP ; kymography analysis was carried out as in Figure 1E ; error bars represent 95 % CI . 922 Cell 128 , 915 – 929 , March 9 , 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . Depletion of Coronin 1B Disrupts Normal Slingshot 1L Targeting to the Leading Edge Coronin 1B may act upstream of SSH1L and thereby inﬂu - ence SSH1L - induced hyper - rufﬂing . For example , Coro - nin 1B may allow SSH1L to reach its substrate ( Coﬁlin ) and thereby inﬂuence lamellipodial dynamics . To test this idea , we compared the localization of SSH1L - GFP in control and in Coronin 1B - depleted cells . shRNAs were coexpressed with SSH1L - GFP using a single lentirviral vector ( Figure 6A ) , so that every cell expressing SSH1L - GFP also expressed either Coronin 1B - speciﬁc or control shRNA . SSH1L - GFP was not as enriched at the leading edge of Coronin 1B - depleted cells as in the control cells ( Figure 6B ) when compared to the distribution of Cortactin ( see Figure S1 ) . In control shRNA expressing cells , the maximal peaks of Cortactin and SSH1L - GFP were sepa - rated by an average of 0 . 35 m m . In Coronin 1B - depleted cells , Cortactin was distributed identically to that in control cells , but the peak of SSH1L - GFP signal was approxi - mately twice as far rearward from the peak of Cortactin than in control cells ( Figure 6C ) . These data suggest that Coronin 1B is required to target SSH1L to a distinct region within lamellipodia and that proper targeting of SSH1L is required to exert an effect on lamellipodial dynamics . Previous studies suggested that binding of SSH1L to F - actin targeted it to the leading edge ( Nagata - Ohashi et al . , 2004 ) . To examine the role of F - actin in localizing SSH1L within lamellipodia , we stained cells expressing SSH1L - GFP ( + / (cid:3) Coronin 1B shRNA ) with phalloidin ( Fig - ure 6D ) . In control cells , SSH1L - GFP and F - actin colocal - ized within lamellipodia , however in Coronin 1B - depleted cells , the distribution of F - actin was indistinguishable from that in control cells at the level of light microscopy , but SSH1L - GFP was excluded from the most distal , F - actin rich region near the leading edge . This result indi - cates that F - actin is insufﬁcient to target SSH1L to the leading edge , but does not exclude a contribution of F - actin - SSH1L interactions for stimulating phosphatase ac - tivity ( Nagata - Ohashi et al . , 2004 ; Soosairajah et al . , 2005 ) . Depletion of Coronin 1B Inhibits Endogenous Coﬁlin Phosphatases To test whether Coronin 1B depletion also inhibited en - dogenous Coﬁlin phosphatase activity , we compared the phospho - Coﬁlin levels in cells expressing Coronin 1B - shRNA and control shRNA . Cells depleted of Coronin 1B had higher levels of phospho - Coﬁlin relative to controls ( Figure 7A ) . This effect is not due activation of Coﬁlin ki - nases because Coronin 1B - depletion does not alter the level of active LIMK 1 / 2 . To conﬁrm the effect of Coronin 1B depletion on phospho - Coﬁlin levels , we determined the ratio of active - to - total Coﬁlin in Coronin 1B - depleted cells using ratiometric imaging ( Figure 7B ) . In control cells , the ratio of active - to - total Coﬁlin was similar to that in sur - rounding uninfected cells ; in Coronin 1B - depleted cells , the ratio of active - to - total Coﬁlin is lower than in unin - fected cells , particularly in lamellipodial regions ( Fig - ure 7B ) . The ratio of active - to - total Coﬁlin across the whole cell is approximately 2 - fold lower in Coronin 1B - depleted cells ( Figure 7C ) . Together , these results indicate that Coronin 1B enhances dephosphorylation and activa - tion of Coﬁlin . Moreover , these ﬁndings are consistent with the biochemical and cellular effects of ectopic expression of SSH1L - GFP and suggest Coronin 1B inﬂuences Coﬁlin activity via a Slingshot - dependent mechanism . Activated Coﬁlin Partially Rescues the Effects of Coronin 1B Depletion on Lamellipodial Dynamics Since Coronin 1B - depletion increases the amount of phospho - Coﬁlin , we postulated that the effects on lamel - lipodial dynamics might be due , in part , to a failure to activate Coﬁlin at the leading edge . To test this idea , we coexpressed an activated Coﬁllin mutant ( S3A ) along with Coronin 1B or control shRNA . Lamellipodial protru - sions extended faster and were shorter - lived in cells ex - pressing Coﬁlin ( S3A ) - GFP than those in either control cells expressing no Coﬁlin ( S3A ) - GFP or non - transfected cells ( Figure 7D ) , similar to the effects of expressing SSH1L - GFP . Coexpression of Coﬁlin ( S3A ) - GFP and Coronin 1B shRNA partially suppressed the effects on la - mellipodial dynamics of Coronin 1B depletion . Lamellipo - dial protrusion rate decreased and protrusion persistence was modestly increased , but did not reach control levels . It is important to note that , although Coﬁlin S3A rescued the lamellipodial dynamics associated with depletion of Coronin 1B , it did not rescue the effects on whole - cell mo - tility ( data not shown ) . Together , these data suggest that Coronin 1B promotes the activation of Coﬁlin at the lead - ing edge . DISCUSSION The Cellular Function of Coronin 1B Our data indicate that Coronin 1B is a key regulator of whole - cell motility and lamellipodial dynamics . Although Coronin 1B is not absolutely required for cells to move or lamellipodia to protrude , it enhances these processes and is a likely target of signal transduction cascades that regulate motility . Coronin 1B inﬂuences motility through control of actin ﬁlament dynamics and architecture at the leading edge . In the absence of Coronin 1B , retro - grade actin ﬂow is reduced and the dendritic actin mesh - work of the lamellipodia is abnormal . These two obser - vations are likely to be aspects of the same underlying phenomenon , as the architecture of the actin network re - ﬂects the balance of actin assembly at the front and disas - sembly at the back of the lamellipodia . Future studies will dissect the relative contributions of actin assembly / disas - sembly and myosin - based contraction to Coronin 1B’s ef - fect on retrograde ﬂow . Most striking is the different distribution and density of actin barbed ends in the lamellipodia of cells lacking Coro - nin 1B . Cells depleted of Coronin 1B have higher barbed end density than controls and the barbed ends are concentrated in a narrower zone at the leading edge .

Increased barbed ends could arise by three mechanisms : failure to cap or uncapping of existing ﬁlaments , severing of ﬁlaments or de novo nucleation of new ﬁlaments . Since Coronin 1B has no detectable capping activity ( Figure S6 ) , failure to cap ﬁlaments can be eliminated from consider - ation . The increased barbed ends observed with Coronin 1B depletion are also unlikely to result from increased ﬁl - ament severing since Coﬁlin is less active in the lamellipo - dia of knockdown cells . We cannot exclude an effect on Coﬁlin - independent severing ( e . g . , Gelsolin ) , but since Coﬁlin is required for protrusion , it is probably the predom - inant severing factor in lamellipodia . We suggest that increased nucleation of ﬁlaments most likely results in increased barbed ends in lamellipodia of Coronin 1B - depleted cells . Coronin 1B Inhibits Arp2 / 3 - Mediated Nucleation in a Phosphoregulated Manner Consistent with the increased density of barbed ends in lamellipodia of Coronin 1B - depleted cells , recombinant Coronin 1B inhibits the nucleation activity of Arp2 / 3 in vitro . This inhibitory effect on Arp2 / 3 activity is a con - served property of Coronins from yeast to humans ( Humphries et al . , 2002 ) . Other proteins such as Tropomy - osin , Caldesmon and EPLIN inhibit Arp2 / 3 complex nucle - ation activity , but these proteins are thought to bind tightly to the sides of actin ﬁlaments and compete with binding of Arp2 / 3 complex to the mother actin ﬁlament ( Blanchoin et al . , 2001 ; Maul et al . , 2003 ; Yamakita et al . , 2003 ) to in - directly inhibit ﬁlament - dependent Arp2 / 3 nucleation ac - tivity .

Our ﬁndings support this notion since Coronin 1B S2D binds poorly to Arp2 / 3 and has weaker inhibitory activity . Further studies will be required to elucidate the molecular mechanism of Coronin 1B’s inhibition of Arp2 / 3 complex . Our results suggest that limiting ﬁlament nucleation ac - tivity via Coronin 1B is important for efﬁcient lamellipodial protrusion . This conclusion is consistent with other stud - ies in which lamellipodial protrusions formed in response to EGF were blocked in cells microinjected with the Arp2 / 3 complex activating VCA ( WA ) domain of SCAR or WASP ( Shao et al . , 2006 ) . Coronin 1B apparently serves to temper ﬁlament nucleation by Arp2 / 3 complex in lamel - lipodia , especially close to the membrane where several WASP / SCAR coactivating factors , such as Rac , Cdc42 and PIP 2 , are enriched . In the absence of Coronin 1B , nu - cleation by Arp2 / 3 complex may be overactive , leading to the increased free barbed ends and the faster rate of pro - trusion observed in Coronin 1B depleted cells . Without a means to limit Arp2 / 3 complex activity , explosive gener - ation of new ﬁlaments could result in short - lived protru - sions that stall as G - actin becomes limiting , consistent with the decreased protrusion persistence and distance observed in the Coronin 1B - depleted cells . Previous models for the control of ﬁlament nucleation in lamellipo - dia focused on the localized activation of WASP / SCAR / Formin proteins by inositol lipids and Rho - type GTPases . Our studies suggest that nucleation control is more com - plex than current models predict and involves a balance between nucleation promoting factors and inhibitors . Coronin 1B Regulates SSH1L Localization and Coﬁlin Activity Coronin 1B is required for SSH - induced lamellipodial ac - tivity and for targeting SSH1L within lamellipodia . Through these processes , Coronin 1B could signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the activity of Coﬁlin at the leading edge . This mechanism for regulating Coﬁlin activity is analogous to the mecha - nisms regulating many kinases and phosphatases via tar - geting subunits and scaffolds ( Cohen , 2002 ; Sim and Scott , 1999 ) . It is important to note that targeting of SSH1L does not override other mechanisms of Slingshot regulation such as phosphorylation or F - actin binding ( Na - gata - Ohashi et al . , 2004 ) . Rather , it is likely that appropri - ate targeting of SSH1L works in conjunction with these other regulatory events to control Slingshot’s activity spa - tially and temporally . Our studies in ﬁbroblasts link Coronins and Coﬁlin activ - ities via SSH , however there is precedence for such a con - nection in other systems ( Goode et al . , 1999 ) . Mutations in the single yeast Coronin gene are benign except when combined with mutations in the Coﬁlin gene . F - actin accu - mulates in abnormal aggregates in double Coronin / Coﬁlin mutants , but not with each single mutant , suggesting that these proteins function together to promote actin turnover in this organism . Recent studies also identiﬁed Coronin 1A as a factor leading to actin depolymerization in Listeria actin tails ( Brieher et al . , 2006 ) . This study suggested that Coronin 1A - bound F - actin has increased afﬁnity for Coﬁlin , perhaps due to altered helical twist . One prediction of this idea is that Coﬁlin may not be recruited to the lead - ing edge in the absence of Coronin . We observed no change in Coﬁlin distribution at the leading edge in Coro - nin 1B - depleted cells ( Figure S8 ) , but future studies are needed to explicitly test whether Coronin 1B has similar activity to Coronin 1A in this regard . It is possible that Co - ronins direct Coﬁlin recruitment and activation via SSH targeting to synergistically control Coﬁlin activity . Regard - less of the precise mechanistic details , a conserved func - tional connection between Coronins and Coﬁlin in regulat - ing ﬁlament dynamics exists from yeast to humans . The Coordination of Arp2 / 3 Complex and Coﬁlin Activity in Lamellipodia Why is a factor that coordinates the activities of Arp2 / 3 complex and Coﬁlin in lamellipodia necessary ? Cell motil - ity is a system - based process that requires precise spatial and temporal control of the individual components . Che - motaxis requires localized and coordinate cytoskeletal re - modeling to achieve directional movement toward a che - motactic signal . Our work identiﬁes Coronin 1B as a link between two major components , Coﬁlin and Arp2 / 3 com - plex , that control actin remodeling in many cells . Since factors that coordinate cytoskeletal dynamics are likely to be crucial for directional sensing and motility , Coronin 1B is likely regulated by chemotactic signaling pathways . This idea is supported by the recent observations that thy - mocytes from Coronin 1A knockout mice are severely de - fective in chemotaxis toward chemokines ( Foger et al . , 2006 ) . Future studies will focus on the role that Coronin 1B plays in directed cell motility and on elucidating the molecular mechanism of Coronin 1B action .
