Kabla and L . Mahadevan School of Engineering and Applied Sciences , Harvard University , 29 Oxford Street , Cambridge , MA 02138 ( Dated : June 27 , 2008 ) We study the role of connectivity on the linear and nonlinear elastic behavior of amorphous systems using a two - dimensional random network of harmonic springs as a model system . A natural characterization of these systems arises in terms of the network coordination relative to that of an isostatic network δz ; a ﬂoppy network has δz < 0 , while a stiﬀ network has δz > 0 . Under the inﬂuence of an externally applied load we observe that the response of both ﬂoppy and rigid network are controlled by the same critical point , corresponding to the onset of rigidity . We use numerical simulations to compute the exponents which characterize the shear modulus , the amplitude of non - aﬃne displacements , and the network stiﬀening as a function of δz , derive these theoretically and make predictions for the mechanical response of glasses and ﬁbrous networks . PACS numbers : 62 . 20 . de The mechanics of crystalline solids is a fairly well un - derstood subject owing to the simplicity of the underlying lattice which is periodic . In contrast , an understanding of the mechanics of amorphous solids is complicated by the presence of quenched disorder , often on multiple scales . Two structural properties aﬀecting the elasticity of dis - ordered solids are their coordination , and the presence of diﬀerent types of interactions between the constituents of vastly dissimilar strengths . In the case of weakly - coordinated covalent glass such as amorphous selenium , the backbone is ﬂoppy , i . e . it is continuously deformable with almost no energy cost , but weak interactions such as van der Waals are responsible for the non - vanishing elastic moduli . On the other hand , highly - coordinated covalent glasses such as silica , or amorphous particle as - semblies where the main interaction is radial , such as emulsions , metallic glasses or granular matter , the back - bone is stiﬀ . In foams and ﬁbrous networks which are made of low - dimensional structures such as ﬁlaments and membranes , there is a wide separation of energetic scales between stretching and bending modes . This leads to a range of curious mechanical responses in these materials including strongly non - aﬃne deformations [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ] and elastic moduli that can be quite sensitive to the ap - plied stress [ 1 , 7 ] . Despite several theoretical advances [ 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 ] , a uniﬁed descriptions of these behav - iors remains to be given . Here we study the mechanical response of simple ﬂoppy and rigid systems as the coordi - nation is continuously varied and propose such a unifying approach . We start by recalling Maxwell’s criterion for rigidity in a central force network [ 13 ] by considering a set of N points in d dimensions , subject to N c constraints in the form of bonds that connect these points . This network has Nd − N c eﬀective degrees of freedom ( ignoring the d ( d + 1 ) / 2 rigid motions of the entire system ) , and an average coordination number z = 2 N c / N . The system is said to be isostatic when the system is just rigid , i . e . the number of constraints and the number of degrees of freedom are just balanced , so that Nd = N c , and z = 2 d . When z < z c , the network exhibits collective degrees of FIG . 1 : ( a ) Stretching a zig - zag chain of springs that are freely hinged costs no energy until they are aligned ; ( b ) A random network of such springs , when subjected to shear , exhibits a nonaﬃne displacement ﬁeld ( see text for deﬁnition ) . Here we show the result for 10000 random springs with coordina - tion z = z c = 4 . 0 , subject to a shear strain γ = 0 . 005 ; ( c ) Zooming in shows the presence of large correlated rotational deformations . freedom with no restoring force ; these solutions are called soft modes . For such a network made of harmonic springs of stiﬀness k , the energy can be written as δE = X h ij i k 2 [ ( δ ~ R i − δ ~ R j ) · ~ n ij ] 2 + o ( δR 2 ) ( 1 ) where ~ n ij is the unit vector going from i to j , and δ ~ R i is the displacement of particles i . Soft modes satisfy δE = 0 , or equivalently ( δ ~ R i − δ ~ R j ) · ~ n ij = 0 ∀ ij . In Fig ( 1 . a ) , we show the example of a one dimensional zig - zag structure that straightens without an energy cost un - til the external load does not couple to the soft modes , i . e . when the latter correspond to node displacements that are orthogonal to the load direction ; the system then becomes stiﬀ . To understand how this simple idea carries over to a ﬂoppy network , we created disordered two - dimensional networks with up to 10000 particles using biperiodic jammed conﬁgurations of bi - disperse particles [ 14 ] . Lin - ear springs were then used to connect neighboring par - ticles ; starting with z ≈ 5 . 5 > z c , a family of net - 2 FIG . 2 : ( a ) Dimensionless stress - strain curves for z = 3 . 8 , 4 . 0 , and 4 . 2 . ( b ) Critical strain γ ∗ vs . δz ≡ z − 4 . Each point av - erages over 2 conﬁgurations . ( c ) Log - log plot of dimensionless stress - strain curve for z = 4 . ( d ) Rescaled stress - strain curves for z ∈ [ 3 . 0 , 4 . 99 ] shows that both ﬂoppy and stiﬀ networks can be described in terms of the relative coordination δz . works with lower coordination is then generated by pro - gressively removing links from the most connected pairs of nodes leading to isotropic networks with low hetero - geneity in both density and coordination , with a range of spring rest lengths with the ratios of extremes vary - ing by a factor of less than 2 . The size of the small - est springs is l , and their stiﬀness k . These networks are diﬀerent from those studied in rigidity percolation [ 8 ] or self - organized networks [ 9 ] , where the ﬂuctuations in coordination are dominant and can rigidify the sys - tem even if z < z c . In addition , to model the pres - ence of weak interactions , we introduce weak springs ( of dimensionless stiﬀness k w ≡ ˜ k w / k = 10 − 5 excepted when stated otherwise . ˜designates dimensional quanti - ties ) with a number density ρ w which stabilize the sys - tem . We impose a pure shear deformation on the net - work incrementally , and minimize the system energy via a damped molecular dynamics method . The spatially av - eraged dimensionless Cauchy stress is then calculated as σ ≡ ˜ σ / k = 12 V P ij ~ f ij N ( ~ R j − ~ R i ) , where the sum is on all springs ij , V = ˜ V / l 2 is the dimensionless area of the simulation cell , ~ f ij ≡ ~ ˜ f ij / kl is the dimensionless force vector in the link ij , and ~ R i ≡ ~ ˜ i R / l is the dimensionless position of particle i . Fig ( 1 . b , c ) shows the response to shear for z = 4 and γ = 0 . 05 . In Fig . ( 2 . a ) we quantify the elastic properties as a func - tion of parameters , and show the existence of three qual - itatively diﬀerent stress - strain relations . For ﬂoppy net - works with z − z c = δz < 0 , there is a critical strain γ ∗ separating a zero stress plateau and a strain - stiﬀening regime ; this critical strain γ ∗ is a function of the deﬁcit in coordination number δz and follows the scaling law γ ∗ ∼ | δz | β , with β = 1 , over nearly two decades up to z = 3 and a strain as large as 40 % . For an isostatic sys - tem with δz = 0 , the system resists shear deformations nonlinearly as soon as γ 6 = 0 ; indeed the stress - strain relation is parabolic σ ∼ γ 2 , as shown in Fig . ( 2 . c ) . Fi - nally , for a rigid system with δz > 0 , a linear stress - strain regime can be identiﬁed ; however both the value of the dimensionless shear modulus G ≡ ˜ G / k and the extent of the linear regime vanishes as δz → 0 , as we discuss quantitatively below . Since the scaling relations in Fig . ( 2 . b , c ) are reminis - cent of a critical point , we look for scaling functions on which all the stress - strain curves must collapse after a suitable re - scaling of the axis . Postulating G ∼ δz θ for z > z c , we write : σ = G ( δz ) γf ± ( γ / γ ∗ ) ≡ δz θ γf ± ( γ δz β ) ( 2 ) where the functions f + ( f − ) characterize the stress - strain relation of rigid ( ﬂoppy ) networks when δz > 0 ( δz < 0 ) . When the argument of f vanishes , the existence of both a linear and ﬂoppy regime implies that f + ( x ) → c , where c is a constant of order one , and f − ( x ) → 0 . For strains much larger than the characteristic strain γ ∗ , the shear modulus must depend on the strain but not depend sig - niﬁcantly on the value of δz . This implies the existence of a power - law form f ( x ) ∼ x χ , with χ = θ / β . Previous numerical and empirical studies [ 5 , 6 , 14 ] show that θ = 1 in two and three dimensions , and were justiﬁed theoreti - cally [ 17 ] . Our numerical results in Fig . ( 2 . b ) imply that β = 1 and Fig . ( 2 . c ) implies χ = 1 , in agreement with the relation derived . To directly check the validity of Eq . ( 2 ) we rescale the axes of Fig . ( 2 . a ) , and show the results in Fig . ( 2 . d ) vindicating our choice of scaling functions . Moving beyond the scaling properties of the stress - strain curves , we now consider the structure of the dis - placement ﬁelds shown in Fig . ( 1 . b ) . The non - aﬃne dis - placement ﬁeld { δ ~ R in . a . ( γ ) } i = 1 . . . N is deﬁned as δ ~ R in . a . = ~ R i − ~ R ia . , where ~ R i is the ﬁnal equilibrated conﬁguration , and ~ R ia . is the aﬃne conﬁguration obtained after the ho - mogeneous strain γ is imposed . We focus on the ampli - tude of the relative displacement among nearest neigh - bors , deﬁned as δR ⊥ n . a . ≡ h | δ ~ R in . a . − δ ~ R jn . a . | i where the average considers all pairs of particles in contact . This is a measure of the rotation of individual springs in the non - aﬃne ﬁeld , and the variation in the relative displacement per unit strain deﬁned as δV ⊥ n . a . ≡ ∂δR ⊥ n . a . ( γ ) / ∂γ charac - terizes this rotation as a function of strain increment . In Fig ( 3 . a ) , we show that δV ⊥ n . a . ∼ | δz | φ with φ = − 1 / 2 , i . e . as the rigid sub - skeleton or backbone becomes strongly constrained , larger and larger displacements are required to accommodate a given shear . The rigid backbone acts as a lever , whose ampliﬁcation factor diverges as one ap - proaches the onset of rigidity corresponding to δz = 0 . This scaling has already been observed in assemblies of elastic particles above the rigidity onset [ 6 ] . A small aﬃne deformation of amplitude γ causes di - mensionless forces | δF i ≡ { ~ F i } on each node . Assum - 3 ( d ) ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) FIG . 3 : ( a ) The relative non - aﬃne displacement per unit strain as deﬁned in the text δV ⊥ n . a . for γ = γ ∗ / 10 and ( b ) the dimensionless shear modulus G vs . − δz , in the ﬂoppy regime , for k w = 10 − 5 . The variation in ( c ) the dimensionless shear modulus G and ( d ) the velocity δV ⊥ n . a . vs . δz ∈ [ − 1 , 1 ] , with k w = 1 / 300 , ρ w = 4 . 1 . We observe in particular the large particle velocity in the vicinity of the isostatic point δz = 0 . ing for convenience of notation that the stiﬀnesses and lengths of all spring are equal leads to ~ F i = P j ( ~ n ij · Γ · ~ n ij ) ~ n ij , where Γ is the corresponding strain ten - sor , and the sum is on all the neighbor j of i . For a rigid system with δz > 0 , the non - aﬃne displacements | δR i ≡ { δ ~ R in . a . } , which corresponds to the displacement of the particle along the direction of unbalanced forces , is : | δR i = M − 1 | δF i = X ω 1 ω 2 h δR ( ω ) | δF i | δR ( ω ) i ( 3 ) where M is the dynamical matrix and | δR ( ω ) i is the nor - malized normal mode of stiﬀness ω 2 . Then the relative displacement between neighboring particles is : δ ~ R ij ≡ δ ~ R i − δ ~ R j = X ω 1 ω 2 h δR ( ω ) | δF i δ ~ R ij ( ω ) ( 4 ) Following the justiﬁcation of [ 11 ] , we shall assume that the contribution of the diﬀerent modes are independent : h | | δ ~ R ij | | 2 i = X ω 1 ω 4 h δR ( ω ) | δF i 2 h | | δ ~ R ij ( ω ) | | 2 i ( 5 ) For weakly coordinated systems , we shall use the results of [ 15 ] which show that above some frequency ω ∗ ∼ δz , ( i ) the density of states D ( ω ) does not depend signiﬁ - cantly on ω and ( ii ) above ω ∗ , the modes are very het - erogeneous , so that the correlations of the displacements of the particles are weak , see also [ 16 ] . For such modes h | | δ ~ R ij ( ω ) | | 2 i ∼ h | | δ ~ R i ( ω ) | | 2 i = 1 / N , the latter equality stemming from the normalization of the modes . To esti - mate h δR ( ω ) | δF i 2 = [ P ij ( δ ~ R i − δ ~ R j ) · ~ n ij ) ( ~ n ij · Γ · ~ n ij ) ] 2 , we use the weak spatial correlation of the modes and treat the diﬀerent terms as independent . Using h ( ~ n ij · Γ · ~ n ij ) ] 2 i ∼ γ 2 then leads to h δR ( ω ) | δF i 2 ∼ γ 2 X ij [ ( δ ~ R i ( ω ) − δ ~ R j ( ω ) ) · ~ n ij ) ] 2 ∼ γ 2 ω 2 ( 6 ) where we used the deﬁnition ω 2 = 1 / 2 P ij [ ( δ ~ R i ( ω ) − δ ~ R j ( ω ) ) · ~ n ij ) ] 2 . Finally , in the large N limit we have P ω 1 / N → R dωD ( ω ) , so that Eq . ( 5 ) yields : h | | δ ~ R ij | | 2 i / γ 2 ∼ Z dω D ( ω ) ω 2 > Z ω > ω ∗ dω 1 ω 2 ∼ 1 ω ∗ ∼ 1 δz ( 7 ) leading to the relation δR ⊥ n . a . ∼ | | δ ~ R ij | | ∼ γ / √ δz . From this we may deduce the strain at which stiﬀ - ening occurs . The small applied aﬃne deformation γ causes forces ~ F i ∼ γ , which lead to small non - aﬃne dis - placements δ ~ R in . a . ≈ γ ~ u i , where ~ u i ≡ lim γ → 0 δ ~ R in . a . / γ . Since the linear approximation δ ~ R in . a . = γ ~ u i is not exact , there are small residual forces on the nodes , but an it - erative perturbative procedure can be used to determine the correction to the leading order result . These residual forces may be estimated following Pythagoras’ theorem : the transverse relative displacement at a contact cause a strain and therefore a residual force of the order of δR ⊥ n . a . 2 ( γ ) ∼ γ 2 δz 2 φ . When this quantity becomes larger that ~ F i ∼ γ , the linear approximation breaks down . This occurs for some γ ∗ ∼ δz β ∼ δz − 2 φ , yielding the relation β = − 2 φ = 1 observed in our numerical simulations . The resulting divergence in the particle velocity explains why non - linearities occur at a very small strain close to the rigidity onset . The previous argument also yields the scaling form for the dimensionless shear stress G in the ﬂoppy regime . In - deed when a shear strain γ is imposed , each weak spring stores a dimensionless energy of order δE ∼ k w δV ⊥ n . a . 2 , leading to G ∼ ρ w k w δE / γ 2 ∼ ρ w k w / | δz | in the ﬂoppy regime , as observed in Fig ( 3 . b ) . Obviously , this scal - ing is expected to fail near the rigidity threshold , and we expect a cross - over to occur when G ∼ δz as ex - pected for the backbone from our earlier scaling argu - ments . This allows us to deﬁne a characteristic coordi - nation scale u ∗ ∼ √ ρ w k w so that there is an associated critical strain γ ∗ ∼ u ∗ ∼ √ ρ w k w where our two esti - mates are of the same order . This deﬁnes three regimes for the mechanical response as a function of the relative coordination : ( i ) For δz < < − u ∗ , G ∼ ( ρ w k w ) / | δz | and γ ∗ ∼ − δz . The rigid backbone is not signiﬁcantly de - formed . ( ii ) For − u ∗ < < δz < < u ∗ , the energy is shared between strong and weak interactions , G ∼ u ∗ ∼ √ ρ w k w and γ ∗ ∼ u ∗ . ( iii ) For δz > > u ∗ , most of the energy is condensed in the rigid backbone , G ∼ δz and γ ∗ ∼ δz . Fig ( 3 . c ) shows the behavior of the shear modulus as the 4 coordination increases , and the cross - over from the ﬂoppy to the rigid network . To conﬁrm this description , we compute δV ⊥ n . a . for diﬀerent coordinations . The result is plotted in Fig ( 3 . d ) for k w = 1 / 300 . Although the ratio of stiﬀnesses between weak and strong springs is large , the intermediate region is of signiﬁcant amplitude and vanishes only as the square root of this ratio , due to the ”lever” eﬀect induced by the backbone . We conclude with a brief discussion of our results and its implications . Using numerical simulations of a weakly coordinated network as an exploratory tool , we have shown that ( i ) rigid and ﬂoppy networks are controlled by the same critical point ( ii ) two exponents , φ and θ which characterize the amplitude of non - aﬃne displacements and the shear modulus respectively completely character - ize the system ; all other exponents describing the eﬀects of non - linearities and the stiﬀness induced by weak inter - actions follow from these . Furthermore , near the rigidity threshold , the amplitude of the non - aﬃne displacement rapidly increases and the material response is then char - acterized by a point on a two - dimensional phase diagram ( δz , u ∗ ) . In the context of glasses , our model may de - scribe tetrahedral network glasses , such as silica , amor - phous silicon or water , where ﬂuctuations of coordination are rare at reasonable pressures . Such networks , where the joints linking tetrahedra are soft , are marginally rigid [ 17 , 22 ] , and the dominant weak interaction rigidifying the system is the energy required to change the angle be - tween two adjacent tetrahedra , whose strength is small for silica , and much larger for silicon . Thus silica is ex - pected to behave eﬀectively as a weakly - coordinated net - work , and exhibit large non - aﬃne displacements , while amorphous silicon should not . In contrast , for chalco - genide glasses where the composition of atoms of diﬀer - ent valence can be modiﬁed to control rigidity [ 18 ] , the precise topology of the covalent network near the rigid - ity threshold is still unsettled [ 19 , 20 ] . Our model is presumably the simplest approximation of such networks and gives a plausible explanation for the observation of a smooth cross - over in the elastic moduli near z c [ 23 ] : although Van der Waals interactions are two orders of magnitude softer than covalent bonds , their eﬀect is not negligible near z c due to the lever eﬀect of the backbone that we have described , and further predicts that the non - aﬃne displacement will be maximum near the rigid - ity threshold . In solid foams or stiﬀ ﬁber networks , the diﬀerent interactions at play ( bending , stretching , cross - link rigidity . . . ) cause a change in the eﬀective coordi - nation . Since bending is a softer mode than stretching , those ﬁbrous systems will be in general ﬂoppy . Our work yields the simple prediction that the strain γ ∗ at which the system begins to stiﬀen and the amplitude of the non aﬃne displacement will be anti - correlated , and that γ ∗ will decrease as cross - links are added or ﬁber length is increased . At a quantitative level , we expect the corre - sponding exponents to depend on the particular struc - tural properties of the network [ 10 , 24 ] . In particular , ( i ) if long ﬁbers are present , non - aﬃne displacements are enhanced , δV ⊥ n . a . ∼ 1 / | δz | [ 10 ] , and non - linearities are expected to occur at a smaller strain , and ( ii ) if the link size is widely distributed , small links will eﬀectively act as points of higher coordination , which will also tend to reduce γ ∗ . More generally , our study suggests that the amplitude of the non - aﬃne displacements allows us to classify amorphous solids according to their closeness to criticality in the coordination number .
