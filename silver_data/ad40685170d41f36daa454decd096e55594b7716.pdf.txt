Time courses of MgmantADP dissociation from myosin V and actomyosin V are biphasic with fast observed rate constants that depend on the [ Mg 2 + ] and slow observed rate constants that are [ Mg 2 + ] - independent . Two myosin V - MgADP states that are in reversible equilibrium , one that exchanges nucleotide and cation slowly ( strong binding ) and one that exchanges nucleotide and cation rapidly ( weak binding ) , account for the data . The two myosin V - MgADP states are of comparable energies , as indicated by the relatively equimolar partitioning at saturating magnesium . Actin binding lowers the affinity for bound Mg 2 + 2 - fold but shifts the isomerization equilibrium (cid:24) 6 - fold to the weak ADP binding state , lowering the affinity and accelerating the overall rate of MgADP release . Actin does not weaken the affinity or accelerate the release of cation - free ADP , indicating that actin and ADP binding linkage is magnesium - dependent . Myosin V and myosin V - ADP binding to actin was assayed from the quenching of pyrene actin fluorescence . Time courses of myosin V - ADP binding and release are biphasic , consistent with the existence of two ( weak and strong ) quenched pyrene actomyosin V - ADP conformations . We favor a sequential mechanism for actomyosin V dissociation with a transition from strong to weak actin - binding conformations preceding dissociation . The data provide evidence for multiple myosin - ADP and actomyosin - ADP states and establish a kinetic and thermodynamic framework for defining the magnesium - dependent coupling between the actin and nucleotide binding sites of myosin . The myosin family of molecular motors constitutes a large gene family of proteins that transport biological molecules along actin filament tracks and have been implicated in various cellular functions including membrane trafficking , cytokinesis , cell migration , and signal transduction ( 1 ) . At least 18 different classes ( classes I - XVIII ) make up the family . All identified myosins possess a highly conserved catalytic motor domain that binds actin , hydrolyzes ATP , and performs the mechanical work . The actomyosin ATPase cycle consists of a series of nucleotide - linked , biochemical reactions that are coupled to energetic and conformational changes in myosin ( 2 ) . Myosin without bound nucleotide binds actin filaments with high affinity . ATP binding opens the actin - binding cleft of myosin , which lowers its affinity for actin , causing myosin to dissociate from actin . Detached myosin undergoes a con - formational change that allows it to hydrolyze ATP to ADP and P i . The hydrolysis products remain bound noncovalently to myosin , yielding the kinetically stable but thermodynami - cally unstable high - energy myosin - ADP - P i intermediate . Myosin - ADP - P i binding to actin accelerates rate - limiting P i release . This transition increases the affinity of myosin for actin and accompanies the force - generating power stroke . ADP release generates actomyosin with no bound nucleotide , and the catalytic cycle begins again with ATP binding . Understanding the linkage between actin binding and the chemical state of the bound nucleotide is a central issue in defining the mechanism of force generation and work output by myosin motors . Actin binding weakens the affinity and accelerates the release of the hydrolysis products , ADP and P i , from myosin . In this regard actin can be considered a nucleotide exchange factor for myosin ( 3 ) similar to the regulatory proteins that act on members of the G - protein family . In this system , binding of the exchange factor disrupts the coordination of the nucleotide - associated cation , which accelerates the overall release of the bound nucleotide ( 4 ) . This mechanistic strategy has also been reported for other nucleotide exchange proteins such as profilin , which ac - celerates nucleotide exchange from actin monomers ( 5 ) , and kinesin , where microtubule binding accelerates the release of MgADP ( 6 ) . It is clear that , for many proteins , coordina - tion of the nucleotide - associated cation frequently plays an important role in regulating the nucleotide binding affinities and kinetics of release . Myosin V is a processive two - headed myosin that takes multiple steps along actin before dissociating . It accomplishes this task , in part , by spending the majority of its ATPase cycle time strongly bound to actin and ADP so that ADP release is the rate - limiting step ( 7 ) . Compared to other myosins , the coupling between actin and ADP binding is weak for myosin V and actin binding has minimal effects † This work was supported by grants from the American Heart Association ( No . 0235203N ) and the National Science Foundation ( MCB - 0216834 ) to E .

We initiated this study to determine the role of bound magnesium in dictating the ADP and actin affinities of myosin V and to evaluate if the coupling between actin and ADP binding to myosin V is [ Mg 2 + ] - dependent . Our results establish a kinetic and thermodynamic framework for defin - ing the magnesium - dependent coupling between the actin and nucleotide binding sites of myosin , and demonstrate that actin weakens ADP binding to myosin V by disrupting coordination of bound Mg 2 + and shifting the equilibrium between two myosin V - ADP states to favor formation of the state that binds nucleotide and cation weakly . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Reagents . ADP ( Sigma A - 5285 , purity 99 + % as assayed by HPLC , data not shown ) was purchased from Sigma ( St . Louis , MO ) . ADP concentrations were determined by ab - sorbance at 259 nm using (cid:15) 259 of 15 400 M - 1 cm - 1 . N - Methylanthraniloyl - ADP ( mantADP , 1 mixed 2 ¢ and 3 ¢ isomers ) was purchased from Molecular Probes ( Eugene , OR ; Catalog No . M - 12416 , Lot No . 12B1 - 3 ) ; 2 ¢ - deoxy - mantADP was synthesized as described ( 8 ) . MantADP concentrations were determined using (cid:15) 255 of 23 300 M - 1 cm - 1 . MgCl 2 solution ( 1 M ) was purchased from American Bioanalytical . Protein Expression and Purification . Single - headed chicken myosin V - 1IQ with bound light chain 1sa ( referred to as myosin V throughout ) was purified from Sf9 cells by Flag affinity chromatography ( 7 , 9 ) . Purity was > 98 % for all preparations ( Figure 1 ) . Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle and gel filtered over Sephacryl S - 300HR . Ca 2 + - actin monomers were converted to Mg 2 + - actin mono - mers with 0 . 2 mM EGTA and 50 (cid:237) M ( excess over actin ) MgCl 2 immediately prior to polymerization by dialysis into KMg50 buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT , 2 mM MgCl 2 and 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 ) . Phalloidin ( 1 . 1 molar equiv ) was used to stabilize actin filaments . Stopped - Flow Measurements . All experiments were per - formed in K50 buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT , and 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 ) supplemented with varying concentrations of MgCl 2 using an Applied Photo - physics ( Surrey , U . K . ) SX . 18MV - R stopped flow apparatus thermostated at 25 ( ( 0 . 1 ) (cid:176) C . The free [ Mg 2 + ] in solution ( i . e . not bound to nucleotides or myosin ) was calculated using the affinities of Mg 2 + for ADP , as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry , and EDTA under our experimental conditions . Essentially identical values were obtained using the program MaxC 2 . 5 ( http : / / www . stanford . edu / (cid:24) cpatton / ) . Time courses of fluorescence change were fitted to a sum of exponentials ( eq 1 ) by nonlinear least - squares fitting using Pro - K software provided with the instrument : where F ( t ) is the fluorescence at time t , F ¥ is the final fluorescence intensity , A i is the amplitude , k i is the observed rate constant characterizing the i th relaxation process , and n is the total number of observed relaxations . The dead time of the instrument determined from the reduction of 2 , 6 - dichlorophenolindophenol in absorbance mode is < 2 ms . Fitting was limited to data beyond 3 ms to account for instrument dead time and to exclude data acquired during the continuous flow phase of mixing as recommended by the manufacturer . Time courses shown are of unaveraged , 1000 - point transients collected with the instrument in over - sampling mode ( intrinsic time constant (cid:24) 30 (cid:237) s ) or , where indicated , the average of two individual traces . In most cases the average of 3 - 6 transients was used for analysis . Uncertainties are reported as standard errors in the fits unless stated otherwise . MantADP Dissociation Kinetics . MantADP release was measured by competing an equilibrated sample of myosin - mantADP or actomyosin - mantADP ( in the presence of 4 mM EDTA or 0 . 2 mM MgCl 2 ) with > 100 - fold excess unlabeled ADP ( in the presence of 4 mM EDTA or a range of [ MgCl 2 ] ) . Excess unlabeled ADP ensures that mantADP dissociation is irreversible . Fluorescence ( (cid:236) ex ) 297 nm ) was monitored through a 400 nm long pass colored glass filter . MantADP release from actomyosin V - ADP - P i ( and actomyosin V - ADP ) was measured with the instrument in sequential mixing mode : 2 (cid:237) M myosin V was mixed with 100 (cid:237) M mantADP or mantATP ( mixture of 2 ¢ and 3 ¢ ) , aged for (cid:24) 2 s to allow for product ( ADP - P i or the strong ADP binding state ) formation , and then mixed with 60 (cid:237) M actin filaments and 4 mM MgADP . Final concentrations are 0 . 67 (cid:237) M myosin V , 33 (cid:237) M mantADP or mantATP , 30 (cid:237) M F - actin , and 2 mM MgADP . MantADP Binding Kinetics . Time courses of mantADP binding were acquired under pseudo - first - order conditions with [ nucleotide ] . [ myosin or actomyosin ] . Actomyosin samples were prepared by mixing myosin with 4 (cid:237) M actin filaments and equilibrating at 25 (cid:176) C for at least 10 min . Samples were treated with apyrase ( potato , grade VII , 0 . 1 unit mL - 1 final ) to ensure rigor ( no nucleotide ) conditions . Actin Binding and Dissociation Kinetics . Myosin V and myosin V - ADP binding to actin filaments was monitored by fluorescence quenching of pyrene actin . Fluorescence ( (cid:236) ex ) 366 nm ) was monitored through a 400 nm long pass colored glass filter .

Mg 2 + - free and saturating Mg 2 + conditions were obtained by the addition of 4 mM EDTA or 5 mM MgCl 2 , respectively , to K50 buffer . Nucleotide - free conditions were achieved by incubating myosin V with apyrase ( 0 . 1 unit mL - 1 ) at 25 (cid:176) C for 20 min . Time courses were corrected for photobleaching by subtracting the time courses of pyrene actin fluorescence acquired under identical experimental conditions . Isothermal Titration Calorimetry . The affinity of Mg 2 + for ADP was measured at 25 ( ( 0 . 1 ) (cid:176) C in K50 buffer essentially as described ( 10 , 11 ) with a MicroCal ( Northamp - ton , MA ) MCS isothermal titration calorimeter . DTT was not included in the reaction buffer to eliminate DTT related baseline problems . Data analysis was done with Origin software accompanying the instrument . RESULTS A . [ Mg 2 + ] Dependence of MantADP Dissociation from Myosin V . MantADP dissociation from myosin V was measured by competition with unlabeled ADP . In the presence of 3 mM free Mg 2 + , the time course of fluorescence change after mixing myosin V - mantADP ( mixed 2 ¢ and 3 ¢ isomers ) with excess MgADP follows a double exponential ( Figure 2A ) with fast ( 10 . 8 ( 0 . 9 s - 1 ) and slow ( 2 . 2 ( 0 . 1 s - 1 ) observed rate constants . The time course of 2 ¢ - deoxy - mantADP dissociation from myosin V also follows a double exponential ( Figure 2C ) with fast ( 13 . 3 ( 0 . 5 s - 1 ) and slow ( 2 . 3 ( 0 . 1 s - 1 ) observed rate constants comparable to those of the mixed isomers , confirming that the biphasic time courses are not due to the mixed 2 ¢ - and 3 ¢ - labeled isomers . The relative amplitude of the fast and slow phases for both mantADP and 2 ¢ - deoxy - mantADP are 30 % and 70 % , re - spectively . The time course of mantADP release when mixing with excess MgATP is also biphasic with a fast observed rate constant of 12 . 0 ( 0 . 1 s - 1 and slow observed rate constant of 2 . 0 ( 0 . 03 s - 1 ( data not shown ) . This indicates that the ADP biphasic dissociation from myosin V is independent of the competing unlabeled ligands . The observed rate constant of the fast dissociation depends strongly on the magnesium concentration and is saturated at (cid:24) 2 mM free Mg 2 + ( Figure 3A ) . The slow phase is weakly dependent on magnesium concentration ( Figure 3B ) . The time course of mantADP release from myosin V in the presence of excess EDTA and no added magnesium ( free [ Mg 2 + ] (cid:24) 0 ) can be well - fitted to a single exponential with an observed rate constant of 47 . 3 ( 1 . 3 s - 1 ( Figure 2A ) , indicating that divalent cation - free ADP dissociates from myosin V (cid:24) 5 times more rapidly than MgADP ( k - mD > k - Mg . mD in Scheme 1 ) . The time course of mantADP release from myosin V after mixing an equilibrated mixture of myosin V - mantADP and 0 . 2 mM magnesium with excess EDTA ( which leaves (cid:24) 100 nM free Mg 2 + in solution after mixing ) deviates slightly from a single exponential ( data not shown ) , with a fast observed rate constant of 44 . 0 ( 1 . 3 s - 1 and a small slow phase amplitude comprising (cid:24) 4 . 5 % of the total amplitude . Since the rate of ADP dissociation measured by mixing myosin V - MgADP with excess EDTA is essentially identical to dissociation from myosin V - ADP in the absence of Mg 2 + , bound Mg 2 + must dissociate from myosin V - MgADP more rapidly than cation - free ADP dissociates ( i . e . Mg 2 + dissoci - ates from myosin - MgADP at > 47 s - 1 and ADP release is not limited by Mg 2 + dissociation ) . EDTA makes Mg 2 + dissociation irreversible , and ADP is released as a divalent cation - free species . If bound Mg 2 + dissociated only as a complex with ADP , EDTA would bind Mg 2 + after MgADP release and would not accelerate the observed mantADP dissociation rate constant . We interpret the biphasic time courses of mantADP release in the presence of magnesium , the [ Mg 2 + ] dependence of the observed fast dissociation rate constant , and the weak [ Mg 2 + ] dependence of the observed slow dissociation rate constant to mean that there are two myosin V - ADP states , F IGURE 2 : Kinetics of MantADP dissociation from myosin V and actomyosin V .

Mg . mD (cid:226) ) and one that does not ( M . Mg . mD R ) , and favor the reaction mechanism in Scheme 1 to describe the mechanism of ADP and Mg 2 + exchange from myosin V . In Scheme 1 , M is myosin V , Mg is the divalent magnesium cation , Mg . mD is the Mg 2 + - ADP complex , and mD is cation - free mantADP . Scheme 1 ignores formation of a collision complex which is likely to be an intermediate preceding formation of the (cid:226) states along the nucleotide binding pathway . The top pathway in Scheme 1 represents ADP dissociation in the presence of saturating Mg 2 + , and the bottom pathway represents ADP dissociation in the absence of Mg 2 + . The fast phase of mantADP dissociation , in the presence of magnesium , represents dissociation through both k - Mg . mD ( with saturating Mg 2 + ) and k - mD ( without Mg 2 + ) pathways . EDTA chelates Mg 2 + and favors flux through k - mD ( Scheme 1 ) . The single phase of ADP dissociation observed in the absence of added Mg 2 + and in the presence of excess EDTA indicates that the M . mD R state ( Scheme 1 ) is not significantly ( e 10 % ) populated when Mg 2 + is absent . Therefore , the observed rate constant of the slow phase ( k slow ) in the presence of saturating Mg 2 + represents contributions from isomerization of M . Mg . mD R to M . Mg . mD (cid:226) ( k + isom , Mg and k - isom , Mg ) . At any given Mg 2 + concentration , the effective rate constants k - Mg * . mD , k + isom , Mg * , and k - isom , Mg * ( the symbol * denotes any given [ Mg 2 + ] to distinguish from k - Mg . mD and k + isom , Mg , the fundamental rate constants at saturating [ Mg 2 + ] ) , can be calculated from the fast ( k fast ) and slow ( k slow ) observed rate constants and the fast phase amplitude ( A fast ) according to the following ( see Appendix ) : The isomerization rate constants k + isom , Mg and k - isom , Mg * were calculated by averaging k + isom , Mg * and k - isom , Mg * ( cal - culated using eqs 2 , 3 , and 4 ) values at saturating ( g 2 mM ) Mg 2 + ( Figure 3 , Table 1 ) and were used to calculate the isomerization equilibrium constant ( K isom , Mg ) k - isom , Mg * / k + isom , Mg ) in the presence of saturating ( g 2 mM free ) Mg 2 + . The value of 0 . 59 for K isom , Mg ( Table 1 ) indicates that the equilibrium between the two myosin V - ADP binding states ( M . Mg . mD R and M . Mg . mD (cid:226) ) favors formation of the strong ADP binding state ( M . Mg . mD R ) . MantADP dissociates as a cation - free species with rate constant k - mD in the absence of cation , and as a metal - nucleotide complex with rate constant k - Mg . mD in the presence of saturating Mg 2 + . At intermediate Mg 2 + concentrations , dissociation through both pathways ( k - Mg . mD and k - mD ) contributes to the effective mantADP dissociation rate constant ( k - Mg * . mD ) which can be expressed in terms of k - Mg . mD and k - mD as ( see Appendix ) where K Mg , b is the dissociation equilibrium constant for Mg 2 + binding to myosin V with bound mantADP ( M . Mg . mD (cid:226) ) . The [ Mg 2 + ] dependence of the dissociation rate constant k - Mg * . mD was calculated using eqs 2 , 3 , and 4 ( Figure 3A ) . The best fit of the [ Mg 2 + ] dependence of k - Mg * . mD to eq 5 yields an affinity ( K Mg , b ) of 65 ( 11 (cid:237) M for Mg 2 + binding to myosin V - mantADP ( Figure 3A ) . Extrapolation of the data to the limit of [ Mg 2 + ] ) 0 yields a rate constant ( k - mD ) of 42 . 0 ( 1 . 4 s - 1 for divalent cation - free mantADP dis - sociation from myosin V , comparable to the rate measured directly by mixing with excess EDTA and no added Mg 2 + F IGURE 3 : [ Mg 2 + ] dependence of mantADP dissociation from myosin V and actomyosin V .

Extrapolation of the data to [ Mg ] ) ¥ indicates that Mg 2 + - mantADP dissociates more slowly with a rate constant ( k - Mg . mD ) of 9 . 0 ( 0 . 6 s - 1 ( Figure 3A ) . The rate and equilibrium constants of Scheme 1 are summarized in Table 1 . B . [ Mg 2 + ] Dependence of mantADP Dissociation from Actomyosin V . In the presence of 3 mM free Mg 2 + the time course of fluorescence change after mixing actomyosin V - mantADP with excess MgADP follows a double expo - nential ( Figure 2B ) with fast ( 13 . 8 ( 0 . 2 s - 1 , 80 % ) and slow ( 1 . 0 ( 0 . 1 s - 1 , 20 % ) observed rate constants . As with myosin V in the absence of actin , the fast observed rate constants depend strongly on [ Mg 2 + ] and saturate at (cid:24) 2 mM free Mg 2 + ( Figure 3A ) and the slow phases depend weakly on [ Mg 2 + ] ( Figure 3B ) . The time course of 2 ¢ - deoxy - mantADP dis - sociation from actomyosin V also follows a double expo - nential ( Figure 2C ) with fast ( 24 . 0 ( 0 . 3 s - 1 ) and slow ( 0 . 8 ( 0 . 1 s - 1 ) observed rate constants . The slow phase was smaller when ATP was used to displace bound mantADP ( data not shown ) . The time course of mantADP release from actomyosin V in the presence of excess EDTA and no added magnesium can be well - fitted to a single exponential with an observed rate constant of 44 . 7 ( 1 . 0 s - 1 ( Figure 2B ) , (cid:24) 3 times more rapid than with Mg 2 + . In addition , the time course of mantADP release from actomyosin V after mixing an equilibrated mixture of actomyosin V - mantADP and 0 . 2 mM magnesium with excess EDTA ( which leaves (cid:24) 100 nM free Mg 2 + in solution after mixing ) deviates slightly from a single exponential ( data not shown ) , with a fast observed rate constant of 44 . 4 ( 0 . 4 s - 1 and a slow observed rate constant of 1 . 2 ( 0 . 2 s - 1 comprising (cid:24) 4 - 5 % of the total amplitude . We favor a similar reaction mechanism ( Scheme 2 ) to describe the biphasic time courses of mantADP release from actomyosin V and the [ Mg 2 + ] dependence of the mantADP dissociation rate constants . In Scheme 2 , AM . Mg . mD (cid:226) exchanges bound cation rapidly and AM . Mg . mD R does not exchange cation as supported by the lack of [ Mg 2 + ] dependence of the slow phase . Scheme 2 ignores formation of a collision complex which is an intermediate preceding formation of the (cid:226) states along the binding pathway ( 12 ) . The top and bottom pathways ( Scheme 2 ) represent ADP dissociation in the presence of saturating Mg 2 + and in the absence of Mg 2 + , respectively . The single phase of ADP dissociation observed in the absence of added magnesium and excess EDTA indicates that the AM . mD ¢ state is not populated to a great extent ( e 10 % ) without Mg 2 + . As described for myosin V in the absence of actin ( Scheme 1 ) , the rate constants , k ¢ - Mg * . mD , k ¢ + isom , Mg * , and k ¢ - isom , Mg * , at any Mg 2 + concentration can be determined from the observed fast and slow rate constants and the fast phase amplitude ( eqs 2 , 3 , and 4 ) . The best fit of the [ Mg 2 + ] dependence of the rate constant ( k ¢ - Mg * . mD ) , reflecting ADP dissociation from the weak ADP binding state ( AM . Mg . mD (cid:226) ) , to eq 5 ( Figure 3A ) yields an affinity ( K ¢ Mg , b ) of 110 ( 21 (cid:237) M for Mg 2 + binding to actomyosin V - mantADP ( Figure 3A ) . Extrapola - tion of the data to the limit of [ Mg 2 + ] ) 0 yields a rate constant ( k ¢ - mD ) of 46 . 2 ( 1 . 5 s - 1 for divalent cation - free mantADP dissociation from actomyosin V , comparable to the observed rate constant measured directly in the presence of excess EDTA and no added magnesium ( 44 . 7 ( 1 . 0 s - 1 ; Figure 2B ) . Mg 2 + - mantADP dissociates from actomyosin V more slowly with a rate constant ( k ¢ - MgmD ) of 14 . 5 ( 0 . 7 s - 1 ( from the best fit ) , in agreement with published values determined under comparable conditions ( 7 , 13 , 14 ) . The fundamental isomerization rate constants , k ¢ + isom , Mg and k ¢ - isom , Mg , were calculated by averaging the values of k ¢ + isom , Mg * and k ¢ - isom , Mg * at g 2 mM free Mg 2 + , and yield an isomerization equilibrium constant ( K ¢ isom , Mg ) k ¢ - isom , Mg / k ¢ + isom , Mg ) of 3 . 8 ( Table 2 ) , indicating that the equilibrium between the two actomyosin ADP binding states ( AM . Mg . mD R and AM . Mg . mD (cid:226) ) favors formation of the weak ADP binding state ( AM . Mg . mD (cid:226) ) . This is in contrast to the myosin V - ADP complex , where the M . Mg . mD R and M . Mg . mD (cid:226) equilibrium favors strong ADP binding ( M . Mg . mD R ) . Therefore , actin binding shifts the isomeriza - tion equilibrium to favor weak ADP binding . C . MantADP Binding to Myosin V . Time courses of mantADP binding to myosin V in the presence of 2 mM Mg 2 + or excess EDTA are biphasic ( Figure 4A ) . Without magnesium , the slow phase is e 10 % of the overall signal , consistent with low population of the strong MgADP binding state . The fast observed rate constants depend linearly on the mantADP concentration ( [ MgmD ] ) over the range examined ( Figure 5A , see eq A21 of Appendix ) , permitting the rate constants ( k + Mg . mD and k - Mg . mD ) to be obtained from the slope and y - intercept of the linear fit of the mantADP concentration dependence of the observed fast rate ( Figure 5A ) . In the presence of saturating magnesium , the second - order association rate constant obtained from the slope is 4 . 9 ( 0 . 2 (cid:237) M - 1 s - 1 ( Table 1 ) , in agreement with the published values ( 7 , 9 , 13 ) .

In the absence of magnesium , the slow phase is less than 10 % of the overall signal , consistent with a small population of the strong MgADP binding state . The second - order association rate constant is k ¢ + mD ) 10 . 2 ( 0 . 7 (cid:237) M - 1 s - 1 ( Figure 5A , Table 2 ) .

Time courses of fluores - cence change under all conditions examined ( 2 mM ADP + 5 mM Mg 2 + , 2 mM ADP + 4 mM EDTA , 5 mM Mg 2 + , and 4 mM EDTA ) are biphasic with 5 - 11 % of fast phase ( Figure 6 ) . The majority of actomyosin dissociation is slow with observed rate constants ranging from 0 . 006 to 0 . 039 s - 1 . MgADP increases the dissociation rate constant of actomyo - sin ( Table 3 ) .

Magnesium , ADP , and Actin Binding Linkage in Myosin V Biochemistry , Vol . 44 , No . 24 , 2005 8831 of the fast ( k df , A df ) and slow phases ( k ds , A ds ) , for each condition examined are listed in Table 3 . The biphasic dissociation time course suggests that there are two conformations of actomyosin V with quenched pyrene fluorescence : a strong actin - binding conformation ( AM s ) , and a weak actin - binding conformation ( AM w ) , which allows two distinct mechanisms for actomyosin V dissocia - tion . Dissociation can follow either a parallel dissociation mechanism ( Scheme 3 ) or a sequential mechanism via isomerization from the strong ( AM s ) to weak ( AM w ) actin - binding conformation before dissociation ( Scheme 4 ) . In Schemes 3 and 4 , ( L ) represents optional bound ligands ( ADP and / or Mg 2 + ) . The unquenched collision complexes ( 15 , 16 ) are omitted for simplicity . Note that these are two quenched pyrene actomyosin states that are considered “strongly bound” using the terminology of Geeves ( 15 , 17 ) . Determination of the scheme that accurately describes actomyosin V dissociation requires the following consider - ations . The observed 90 - 95 % slow phase implies that the majority of actomyosin V is in the strong actin - binding conformation ( AM S ) at equilibrium ( t ) 0 ) and that inter - conversion between the two conformations is negligible . The parallel scheme ( Scheme 3 ) predicts that the two actomyosin conformations dissociate independently . Because dissociation of actomyosin V - ADP is biphasic , if the parallel scheme applied , time courses of myosin V - ADP binding to actin filaments would also be biphasic with amplitudes equivalent to those measured from dissociation ( i . e . 5 - 11 % fast and 89 - 95 % slow phase , see Table 3 ) , but this is not observed ( discussed below , binding displays either no slow phase or 68 - 77 % fast phase ) . Therefore , we favor the sequential reaction mechanism to describe the reaction mechanism of actomyosin V dissociation . Fast dissociation is about 2 orders of magnitude more rapid than slow dissociation ( k - w . k - s ; Table 3 ) . Solving Scheme 4 under the condition k - w . k - s and k + w ) 0 ( irreversible release , fulfilled by mixing with excess unlabeled actin ) , with the initial population distributed between AM s and AM w species only , the fast ( k df ) and slow ( k ds ) observed dissociation rate constants and the fast phase amplitude ( A df ) can be expressed in terms of the fundamental rate constants defined in Scheme 4 as follows ( see Appendix ) : The fundamental rate constants calculated by eq 7 are summarized in Table 3 . G . Myosin V Binding to Actin Filaments . Time courses of myosin - ADP and myosin - MgADP binding to pyrene actin filaments follow double exponentials with slow phases that comprise 23 - 32 % of the total amplitude ( Figure 7A ) . Time courses of myosin binding in the absence of ADP ( with and without Mg 2 + , Figure 7A ) follow double exponentials with a small slow phase comprising less than 5 % of the total amplitude . The observed rate constants of the fast phases ( k bf ) depend linearly on the actin concentration ( Figure 7B , C ) . Solving Scheme 4 where k + w [ A ] . k + s with initial popula - tion of A + M (cid:226) ( L ) states only yields ( see Appendix ) where k bf and k bs are fast and slow binding observed rate constants , respectively . Thus , the rate constants defined in Scheme 4 for binding ( k + w ) and dissociation ( k - w† , superscript † is used to distinguish from k - w for pyrene actin dissocia - tion measured directly by competition with unlabeled actin , Table 3 ) from the weak actin - binding state ( AM w . ( L ) ) can be obtained from the slope and y - intercept of the linear fit from the [ actin ] dependence of the observed fast phase , respectively ( Figure 7C ) . The observed rate constants of the slow phases ( k bs ) should be hyperbolic ( k bs (cid:24) 1 - 2 s - 1 ) but display little actin concentration dependence indicating that binding to the weak states is more rapid than dissociation from the weak binding states ( k + w [ A ] . k - w ) .

We used the values ( k - w ) measured directly from dissociation experiments for calculating the equilibrium constants ( Table 4 ) because the weak binding state dissociation rate constants ( k - w† ) obtained from the y - intercept are subject to large uncertainties ( Table 4 ) . H . Actin - Acti V ated Product Release from Myosin V . The maximum actin - activated steady - state ATPase rate of myosin V ( k cat ) in the presence of g 1 mM free Mg 2 + is 12 - 16 s - 1 head - 1 ( 7 , 9 ) ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the slow ( (cid:24) 1 s - 1 ) actomyosin - ADP isomerization is not along the pre - dominant ATPase cycle reaction pathway . One possibility is that the slow isomerization reflects an off - pathway kinetic transition . To test this possibility we measured the rate of actin - activated mantADP and mantADP - P i dissociation from myosin V ( Figure 8 ) . Time courses of actin - activated mantADP release are biphasic , consistent with the formation of two myosin - ADP states . The observed rate constants of the fast and slow phases are comparable to those measured by competing bound mantADP from actomyosin ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . In contrast , time courses of mantADP - P i dissociation follow single exponentials ( Figure 8A ) with observed rate constants that depend hyperbolically on the actin filament concentration ( Figure 8B ) . The maximum rate constant of mantADP release from actomyosin V - mantADP - P i is (cid:24) 16 s - 1 , comparable to the maximum steady - state ATPase turnover rate and dissociation of MgmantADP from the weak ADP binding states , suggesting that , under these experimental conditions , where there is no load on the actomyosin complex , the slow isomerization observed with mantADP does not occur along the ATPase cycle reaction pathway . This suggests that , in the absence of load , the strong ADP binding state ( AM . Mg . mD R ) is not significantly populated during the steady - state actomyosin V ATPase cycle .

Magnesium , ADP , and Actin Binding Linkage in Myosin V Biochemistry , Vol . 44 , No . 24 , 2005 8833 DISCUSSION A . E V idence for Multiple Myosin V - ADP and Actomyosin V - ADP States . The biphasic MgADP binding and dissocia - tion time courses are consistent with two stable ADP bound myosin V and actomyosin V states that are in reversible equilibrium . One state ( M . Mg . mD (cid:226) ) readily exchanges nucleotide and cation . The second ( M . Mg . mD R ) binds nucleotide and cation strongly . The M . Mg . mD R - M . Mg . mD (cid:226) isomerization equilibrium constant is near unity ( K isom , Mg ) 0 . 59 , K ¢ isom , Mg ) 3 . 8 , Tables 1 and 2 ) , indicating that the two states are of comparable energies and populated under equilibrium conditions . However , the slow rate constants for isomerization indicate a reasonably large activation energy barrier . Actin binding weakens the Mg 2 + affinity 2 - fold and shifts the isomerization equilibrium ( K ¢ isom , Mg ) 3 . 8 , Table 2 ) to favor population of the weak ADP binding state ( AM - . Mg . mD (cid:226) in Scheme 2 ) , favoring dissociation of di - valent - cation - free ADP and weakening the overall binding affinity of MgADP . Actin does not weaken the affinity or accelerate the release of cation - free ADP , indicating that the coupling of actin and ADP binding sites requires bound Mg 2 + . Recently a manuscript characterizing the effect of mag - nesium on myosin V ADP binding was published ( 18 ) . The majority of our measurements are in general agreement . However , that study concluded that both myosin - MgADP and actomyosin - MgADP states readily exchanged bound magnesium . We did not observe a [ Mg 2 + ] dependence of the slow phase for ADP binding to myosin V or actomyosin V and favor a mechanism where the strong ADP binding states of myosin V and actomyosin V do not exchange bound Mg 2 + . B . O V erall MgmantADP Binding to Myosin V and Acto - myosin V at Saturating [ Mg 2 + ] . The overall dissociation equilibrium constant for myosin V - MgADP ( K Mg . mD , overall ) is defined as The equilibrium concentrations of strong ( R ) and weak ( (cid:226) ) ADP binding states are determined by [ myosin ] , [ nucleotide ] , and the equilibrium constants for ADP binding ( K Mg . mD ) and isomerization ( K isom , Mg ) from the strong ADP binding state to the weak ADP binding state according to and The sum of the two myosin - MgADP states is Therefore , K Mg . mD , overall can be expressed in terms of the individual equilibrium binding constants as follows : The coefficient K isom , Mg / ( 1 + K isom , Mg ) accounts for contribu - tions of the isomerization equilibrium to the overall ADP affinity . Similarly , the overall ADP dissociation equilibrium con - stant from actomyosin V in the presence of saturating Mg 2 + ( K ¢ Mg . mD , overall ) can be calculated from The overall affinity of ADP binding to myosin V ( K Mg . mD , overall ) is 0 . 7 (cid:237) M , and that of actomyosin V ( K ¢ Mg . mD , overall ) is 1 . 8 (cid:237) M ( Tables 1 and 2 ) . Therefore , actin weakens overall MgADP binding to myosin V by a factor of 2 . 7 ( K ¢ Mg . mD , overall / K Mg . mD , overall ) 2 . 7 ) . C . Mechanism of Actin Binding to Myosin V . Actomyosin V dissociation kinetics indicate that myosin release is biphasic , consistent with two quenched pyrene actomyosin V states ( “strongly” bound and “weakly” bound ) . At equi - librium , the majority of actomyosin V is in the strong actin - binding conformation as indicated by the > 90 % slow phase amplitude . Consequently , we favor a sequential mechanism for strongly bound myosin V dissociation from actin where actomyosin V isomerizes from the strong to the weak actin - binding conformation before dissociation . We should point out that these are two quenched pyrene actomyosin states and are therefore different from the A and R states of Geeves et al . ( 15 , 16 ) where the A state is an unquenched pyrene actomyosin state . Similar to overall ADP binding to myosin V and acto - myosin V , the overall dissociation equilibrium constant for myosin V from actin is where K As is the equilibrium constant for interconversion from the strong to the weak actin - binding state ( Table 3 ) and K Aw is the dissociation equilibrium constant for weak actin binding ( Table 4 ) . MgADP weakens the affinity of myosin V for actin (cid:24) 14 - fold ( Table 4 ) . ADP or Mg 2 + alone has minimal ( < 2 - fold ) effects on actin binding ( Table 4 ) , which suggests that cation and nucleotide together ( MgADP ) weaken acting binding to myosin V dramatically . It is possible that the two quenched actin - binding states ( AM w . ( Mg ) . ADP and AM s . ( Mg ) . ADP ) represent the two mantADP isomerization states ( AM . ( Mg ) . mD R and AM . ( Mg ) . mD (cid:226) , respectively ) . However , the interconversion rate constants from the two quenched actin - binding states ( k + s and k - s in Scheme 4 ) are different from the mantADP isomerization rate constants ( k ¢ - isom ( k - isom ) and k ¢ + isom ( k + isom ) in Schemes 1 and 2 ) , suggesting that the quenched acto - myosin V conformations are distinct from the myosin V - mantADP isomerization states . A pertinent question is to define which ADP - binding isomerization state the M . ( Mg ) . ADP complex populates when binding and dissociating from actin . Our results indicate that , at equilibrium and in the presence of Mg 2 + , the majority of actomyosin V is in the weak ADP binding K Mg . mD , overall ) K Mg . mD ( K isom , Mg 1 + K isom , Mg ) ( 13 ) K ¢ Mg . mD , overall ) K ¢ Mg . mD ( K ¢ isom , Mg 1 + K ¢ isom , Mg ) ( 14 ) K A , overall ) K Aw ( K As 1 + K As ) ( 15 ) K Mg . mD , overall ) [ M ] [ Mg . mD ] ( [ M .

Mg . mD (cid:226) ) , and the majority of myosin V is in the strong ADP binding state ( M . Mg . mD R ) . We therefore conclude that the strong ADP binding state of myosin V ( M . Mg . mD R ) binds actin and that dissociation occurs mostly from the weak ADP binding state ( AM . Mg . mD (cid:226) ) . Further - more , in the absence of Mg 2 + , the strong ADP binding states of both actomyosin V and myosin V are not significantly populated , requiring that myosin V bind and dissociate only from the weak ADP binding states ( M . mD (cid:226) or AM . mD (cid:226) ) . D . Thermodynamic Balance of the Actomyosin V Interac - tion with ADP . Previous studies on the interaction of ADP and actomyosin V used four equilibrium constants to define the interaction of myosin V , MgADP , and actin ( 7 ) . This model implicated a single myosin V - ADP and a single actomyosin V - ADP state , and the product of the equilibrium constants deviated greatly from the predicted value of 1 . It was suggested that unresolved actomyosin ADP binding states could account for the discrepancy in the thermody - namic linkage ( 7 ) . In the present work , we identify two isomerization states for myosin V - ADP and two actomyosin V - ADP confor - mations and can now define the o V erall interaction of myosin V - 1IQ with MgADP and actin filaments as shown in Scheme 5 . In Scheme 5 , M . Mg . mD and AM . Mg . mD represent both ADP states and AM represents both actomyosin V confor - mations . Using our overall equilibrium constants ( Scheme 5 ) , which incorporate the contribution of the ADP isomer - ization and the two actomyosin V conformations , we obtain a product ( clockwise in Scheme 5 ) of 5 . 3 . This value approaches unity more closely than previous analysis . However , the discrepancy in the thermodynamic linkage could be significant , and additional states , such as the actin - binding states described by Geeves ( 15 ) or the ADP states identified by Rosenfeld with smooth muscle myosin II ( 19 ) , may exist and may contribute to the energetic imbalance if they are populated and cannot be fully resolved with our current measurements . In the absence of magnesium , the ADP isomerization states M . mD R and AM . mD R are not significantly ( e 10 % ) populated so the overall ADP dissociation equilibrium constants ( Scheme 5 ) reduce to K mD and K ¢ mD . The product of the equilibrium constants in Scheme 5 in the absence of Mg 2 + is 1 . 2 . Similarly , the interaction of ADP , myosin V , and Mg 2 + , in the presence and absence of actin , is defined as shown in Scheme 6 . The products of the equilibrium constants ( from Tables 1 and 2 ) in Scheme 6 are 1 . 6 and 2 . 1 , in the presence of saturating magnesium and in the absence of magnesium , respectively . In summary , the rate and equilibrium constants obtained in this study provide a sound description , within reasonable error , of the myosin , ADP , and actin binding linkage consistent with the principles of thermodynamics . E . Pathway of Product Dissociation in the Actomyosin V Steady - State ATPase Cycle . Actin - activated mantADP re - lease from myosin - MgmantADP - P i , but not myosin - MgmantADP , does not show a slow phase , suggesting that , under the conditions of no load , the myosin - MgmantADP isomerization and the M . Mg . mD R intermediate are off the main ATPase cycle reaction pathway . However , under high load , the velocity of actomyosin V is reduced ( 20 ) and the dwell times between processive steps are increased ( 21 ) . We predict that , in response to an external load , population of the strongly bound actomyosin V ADP state ( AM . Mg . D R ) prolongs the lifetime of the force - generating step , as has been suggested for several other myosins ( 22 , 23 ) . In addition , there may be another role for the strongly bound ADP state of actomyosin V ( AM . Mg . D R ) . Under conditions where ADP can rebind actomyosin V , the slow isomerization may be relevant . Under physiological nucle - otide concentrations ( mM ATP , (cid:237) M ADP ) the probability of ADP binding to single - headed myosin V is small ( 12 ) . However , modeling of myosin V processive run lengths ( 24 ) suggests that ATP binding to the trailing head is slow ( < 0 . 1 (cid:237) M - 1 s - 1 ) , raising the possibility that ADP rebinds and contributes to termination of a processive run . Therefore , under high concentrations of ADP , the strongly bound ADP state ( AM . Mg . D R ) may become significantly populated and result in a stalling or termination of the processive run . We favor a pathway ( Scheme 7 ) for the myosin V ATPase cycle where binding of myosin - MgADP - P i to actin induces closure the actin - binding cleft and movement of Switch I ( 25 , 26 ) which disrupts magnesium coordination and ac - celerates P i release , generating the weak ADP binding state that readily exchanges bound magnesium ( AM . Mg . mD (cid:226) ) , as shown in Scheme 7 , where R is used to represent a state that exchanges magnesium slowly and (cid:226) is used to represent a state that readily exchanges magnesium ( collision com - plexes are omitted from the reaction scheme for clarity ) . This mechanism is significantly different from a published model of ADP release ( 18 ) , where actomyosin V - ADP enters a strong ADP binding state following P i release and the ADP release pathway follows AM . Mg . mD R f AM . mD R f AM . mD (cid:226) f AM + mD in the presence of saturating magnesium ( i . e . magnesium is released first , and then ADP dissociates as a cation - free species ) . The rate - limiting step in this pathway is AM . mD R f AM . mD (cid:226) , reported as k - isom ) 40 s - 1 ( Figure 7 in ref 18 ) , which implies that the (cid:24) 16 s - 1 turnover rate of actomyosin V is not limited by ADP release from actomyosin . F . Comparison to Other Myosins . The existence of multiple actomyosin - ADP states has been identified in other Scheme 5 Scheme 6 Scheme 7 Magnesium , ADP , and Actin Binding Linkage in Myosin V Biochemistry , Vol . 44 , No . 24 , 2005 8835 myosins including brush border actomyosin I ( 27 ) , smooth muscle myosin II ( 19 ) , and myosin X ( 28 ) , but the magnesium dependence of the stabilities of these states has not been investigated . In addition , several studies have identified two ADP - bound states of fast skeletal muscle myosin ( II ) subfragment - 1 ( S1 ) ( 29 - 37 ) , and of the ternary actoS1 . ADP complex ( 38 - 40 ) . A four - step mechanism for the interaction of S1 with actin has been proposed by Conibear ( 23 ) , where formation of a diffusion - limited collision complex is followed by two consecutive isomerizations with increasing actin affinity . The first isomerization is thought to reflect a stereospecific binding event ( collision complex transition to A state ) , and the second isomerization ( transition between two R states ) to represent the force - generating conformational changes involving the shifting of the S1 regulatory domain , or lever arm ( 41 ) , which has been observed directly in structural studies ( 42 , 43 ) . The mechanism of Conibear builds upon models proposed by Taylor ( 44 ) , White ( 45 ) , and Geeves ( 39 ) and suggests that the two actoS1 . ADP states of the second isomerization may have a role in prolonging the actomyosin crossbridge in the presence of a load ( 23 ) . If the second isomerization states for fast skeletal muscle are akin to the two actomyosin V - ADP states we report here ( AM . Mg . D R and AM . Mg . D (cid:226) ) , then it is plausible that the actomyosin V strong ADP - binding state ( AM . Mg . D R ) serves to maintain strong binding of ADP by actomyosin V under load . In the absence of actin , fast skeletal muscle myosin II ( S1 ) does not exchange bound Mg 2 + with solution ( 46 , 47 ) . Therefore , in the absence of actin , skeletal muscle myosin II predominantly populates a strong - binding MgADP state ( R state ) . However , actin weakens the ADP binding affinity of skeletal muscle myosin II more than 100 - fold ( 48 ) . An actin - induced disruption of Mg 2 + coordination , binding affinity , and shift in the equilibrium among myosin - MgADP states to favor a weakly bound ADP state ( (cid:226) state ) may account for the weak ADP binding affinity and accelerated dissociation rate constant of ADP from actomyosin II , similar to actomyosin V . G . Structural Implications . The crystal structure of myosin V suggests that closure of the actin - binding cleft is coupled to the opening of Switch 1 ( 25 ) . Since Ser218 of Switch 1 helps coordinate bound magnesium , actin binding and subsequent actin - binding cleft closure would disrupt Mg 2 + coordination , weaken Mg 2 + binding , and shift the isomer - ization to favor weak ADP binding , and thus accelerate overall ADP release from myosin V . Recently , a structure of myosin V was obtained by soaking crystals of nucleotide - free myosin V with MgADP ( 26 ) . In this structure , Lys169 of the P - loop is not in position to coordinate the (cid:226) - phosphate of ADP , and the Mg 2 + binding site is vacant because Ser218 of Switch 1 is not oriented properly to coordinate the bound cation . It is likely that this structure represents an intermediate , presumably a collision complex ( 12 ) that is capable of accommodating nucleotide , preceding formation of the weak ADP binding state of myosin V ( M . mD (cid:226) in Scheme 1 ) . Formation of M . mD (cid:226) ( and AM . mD (cid:226) ) is likely to involve reorganization of the P - loop so that it can interact with the (cid:226) - phosphate of ADP , accounting for the reasonably slow ADP dissociation rate constant , even in the absence of bound cation ( Tables 1 and 2 ) . The reorganization of the P - loop with formation of the (cid:226) states would generate a small rotation of the lever arm . A subsequent conformational change ( “closing” ) of Switch 1 would help coordinate the bound magnesium and favor formation of the R states , presumably opening the actin - binding cleft and weakening the affinity for actin .

The 2 - step sequential mechanism ( ignoring collision complex formation ) for ligand ( L ) binding to myosin ( M ) is defined by Scheme A1 , where L represents ADP or actin , M (cid:226) L is the strong L binding state , M (cid:226) ( L ) is the weak L binding state , and M + L represent dissociated states . The differential equations corresponding to Scheme A1 are Two of the above differential equations are independent . The third equation is dependent because it can be derived from the two independent equations by making use of mass conservation ( [ M (cid:226) L ] + [ M (cid:226) ( L ) ] + [ M ] ) 1 ) . Under pseudo - first - order conditions ( [ L ] . [ M ] ) the concentration of ligand [ L ] can be considered constant . Applying mass conservation ( [ M ] ) 1 - [ M (cid:226) L ] - [ M (cid:226) ( L ) ] ) , eq A2 can be expressed as and rearranged to Equations A1 and A5 can be rearranged and expressed as The second - order polynomial equation ( ax 2 + bx 1 + c ) 0 ) for the eigenvalues ( rate constants ) of the expressions in eq Scheme A1 d [ M (cid:226) L ] d t ) - k - isom [ M (cid:226) L ] + k + isom [ M (cid:226) ( L ) ] ( A1 ) d [ M (cid:226) ( L ) ] d t ) k - isom [ M (cid:226) L ] - k + isom [ M (cid:226) ( L ) ] - k - [ M (cid:226) ( L ) ] + k + [ M ] [ L ] ( A2 ) d [ M ] d t ) k - [ M (cid:226) ( L ) ] - k + [ M ] [ L ] ( A3 ) d [ M (cid:226) ( L ) ] d t ) k - isom [ M (cid:226) L ] - k + isom [ M (cid:226) ( L ) ] - k - [ M (cid:226) ( L ) ] + k + [ L ] ( 1 - [ M (cid:226) L ] - [ M (cid:226) ( L ) ] ) ( A4 ) d [ M (cid:226) ( L ) ] d t ) ( k - isom - k + [ L ] ) [ M (cid:226) L ] - ( k + isom + k - + k + [ L ] ) [ M (cid:226) ( L ) ] + k + [ L ] ( A5 ) { ( d d t + k - isom ) [ M (cid:226) L ] - k + isom [ M (cid:226) ( L ) ] ) 0 - ( k - isom - k + [ L ] ) [ M (cid:226) L ] + ( d d t + k + isom + k - + k + [ L ] ) [ M (cid:226) ( L ) ] ) k + [ L ] ( A6 ) 8836 Biochemistry , Vol . 44 , No . 24 , 2005 Hannemann et al . A6 can be obtained by setting the determinant equal to zero : which can be expanded into Two rate constants ( eigenvalues (cid:236) 1 and (cid:236) 2 ) are obtained by solving eq A8 : with The general solution for eq A6 is determined by the two eigenfunctions ( one column matrix in the first two terms ) and a special solution ( third term ) of eq A6 : The c term in eq A11 is defined by eq A10 . C 1 and C 2 are arbitrary constants that are determined by the initial parti - tioning of [ M (cid:226) L ] and [ M (cid:226) ( L ) ] at t ) 0 . Case 1 : Ligand ( L ) Dissociation from Myosin . In mea - surements of ligand ( L ) dissociation kinetics , excess un - labeled ligand competes with labeled ligand and makes dissociation irreversible ( k + ) 0 ) . In this case , the two rate constants ( (cid:236) 1 and (cid:236) 2 ) from eq A9 are Under conditions where k - . k - isom , (cid:236) 1 and (cid:236) 2 simplify to and eq A11 ( the general solution for eq A6 ) reduces to the following expression : To determine the constants C 1 and C 2 , we use the initial partitioning ( governed by k + isom and k - isom ) before ligand L dissociation : At t ) 0 , eq A14 becomes Solving eq A16 yields C 1 and C 2 . Therefore , the observed fluorescence signal change is proportional to the change in the concentrations of M (cid:226) L and M (cid:226) ( L ) species : where A 1 + A 2 ) 1 and the amplitude of the fast phase ( A 1 ) is Under conditions where k - . k - isom , the fast phase amplitude ( A 1 ) is determined by the probability of dissociation from the M (cid:226) ( L ) state [ k - / ( k - + k - isom ) ] and the initial population in the M (cid:226) ( L ) state ( k - isom / ( k + isom + k - isom ) ] according to Combination of eq A13 and eq A20 is used to calculate intrinsic rate constants k - , k - isom , and k + isom from the measured rate constants ( (cid:236) 1 and (cid:236) 2 ) and the fast phase amplitude ( A 1 ) under conditions where k + ) 0 and k - . k - isom . j ( - (cid:236) + k - isom ) ( - k + isom ) ( - k - isom + k + [ L ] ) ( - (cid:236) + k + isom + k - + k + [ L ] ) j ) 0 ( A7 ) ( (cid:236) - k - isom ) ( (cid:236) - k + isom - k - - k + [ L ] ) - ( - k + isom ) ( - k - isom + k + [ L ] ) ) (cid:236) 2 - ( k + isom + k - isom + k - + k + [ L ] ) (cid:236) + k - isom k - + k - isom k + [ L ] + k + isom k + [ L ] ) 0 ( A8 ) (cid:236) ) (cid:236) 1 , 2 ) b ( x b 2 - 4 c 2 ( A9 ) { b ) k + isom + k - isom + k - + k + [ L ] c ) k - isom k - + k - isom k + [ L ] + k + isom k + [ L ] ( A10 ) ( [ M (cid:226) L ] [ M (cid:226) ( L ) ] ) ) C 1 ( 1 - (cid:236) 1 + k - isom k + isom ) e - (cid:236) 1 t + C 2 ( 1 - (cid:236) 2 + k - isom k + isom ) e - (cid:236) 1 t + k + [ L ] c ( k + isom k - isom ) ( A11 ) (cid:236) ) (cid:236) 1 , 2 ) 1 2 ( k + isom + k - isom + k - ( x ( k + isom + k - isom + k - ) 2 - 4 k - isom k - ) ( A12 ) { (cid:236) 1 (cid:24) k - + k + isom (cid:236) 2 (cid:24) k - isom k - k - + k + isom ( A13 ) ( [ M (cid:226) L ] [ M (cid:226) ( L ) ] ) ) C 1 ( 1 - (cid:236) 1 + k - isom k + isom ) e - (cid:236) 1 t + C 2 ( 1 - (cid:236) 2 + k - isom k + isom ) e - (cid:236) 2 t ( A14 ) [ M (cid:226) L ] 0 ) k + isom k + isom + k - isom , [ M (cid:226) ( L ) ] 0 ) k - isom k + isom + k - isom ( A15 ) { C 1 + C 2 ) k + isom k + isom + k - isom C 1 ( - (cid:236) 1 + k - isom k + isom ) + C 2 ( - (cid:236) 2 + k - isom k + isom ) ) k - isom k + isom + k - isom ( A16 ) { C 1 ) - k + isom (cid:236) 2 ( (cid:236) 1 - (cid:236) 2 ) ( k + isom + k - isom ) C 2 ) k + isom (cid:236) 1 ( (cid:236) 1 - (cid:236) 2 ) ( k + isom + k - isom ) ( A17 ) F ( t ) - F ( ¥ ) (cid:181) [ M (cid:226) L ] + [ M (cid:226) ( L ) ] ) A 1 e - (cid:236) 1 t + A 2 e - (cid:236) 2 t ( A18 ) A 1 ) C 1 + C 2 ( - (cid:236) 1 + k - isom k + isom ) ) k - isom k - - ( k + isom + k - isom ) (cid:236) 2 ( (cid:236) 1 - (cid:236) 2 ) ( k + isom + k - isom ) ( A19 ) A 1 (cid:24) ( k - isom k + isom + k - isom ) ( k - k - + k + isom ) ( A20 ) Magnesium , ADP , and Actin Binding Linkage in Myosin V Biochemistry , Vol . 44 , No . 24 , 2005 8837 Case 2 : Ligand ( L ) Binding to Myosin . Under conditions where k + [ L ] . k + isom , the two rate constants ( (cid:236) 1 and (cid:236) 2 ) defined by eq A9 reduce to : Therefore , the observed fast rate constant ( (cid:236) 1 ) depends linearly on the ligand concentration [ L ] and the intrinsic rate constants k + and k - can be obtained respectively from the slope and y - intercept of the linear fit of the observed fast rate constant versus ligand concentration [ L ] .

A2 . Parallel Two - Path Binding Mechanism . The magne - sium - dependent two - path parallel mechanism for ligand ( L ) binding to myosin ( M ) is defined by the reaction mechanism in Scheme A2 , where M (cid:226) Mg (cid:226) L represents myosin bound with magnesium ( M ) and ligand ( L ) , Mg (cid:226) L is the magnesium - ligand complex , and K Mg and K ¢ Mg are dissociation equilib - rium constants for Mg binding . Here , we assume that cation ( Mg 2 + ) association and dissociation is very rapid compared to ligand dissociation and occurs within the dead time of the instrument . Therefore , the equilibrium between M (cid:226) Mg (cid:226) L and M (cid:226) L states ( equilibrium constant 1 / K Mg ) and between Mg (cid:226) L and L molecules ( equilibrium constant 1 / K ¢ Mg ¢ ) is always maintained ( i . e . rapid equilibrium approximation ) . The differential equations for Scheme A2 under pseudo - first - order conditions are The equilibria between M (cid:226) Mg (cid:226) L and M (cid:226) L states and between Mg (cid:226) L and L can be expressed as the following relations : and Combining eqs A28 and A29 yields { (cid:236) 1 (cid:24) k - + k + [ L ] (cid:236) 2 (cid:24) k - isom + k + isom ( k + [ L ] k - + k + [ L ] ) 98 if k + [ L ] . k - k - isom + k + isom ( A21 ) { C 1 + C 2 + k + [ L ] k + isom k - isom k - + k - isom k + [ L ] + k + isom k + [ L ] ) 0 C 1 ( - (cid:236) 1 + k - isom k + isom ) + C 2 ( - (cid:236) 2 + k - isom k + isom ) + k + [ L ] k - isom k - isom k - + k - isom k + [ L ] + k + isom k + [ L ] ) 0 ( A22 ) { C 1 ) k + isom k + [ L ] (cid:236) 2 ( (cid:236) 1 - (cid:236) 2 ) ( k - isom k - + k - isom k + [ L ] + k + isom k + [ L ] ) C 2 ) - k + isom k + [ L ] (cid:236) 1 ( (cid:236) 1 - (cid:236) 2 ) ( k - isom k - + k - isom k + [ L ] + k + isom k + [ L ] ) ( A23 ) F ( t ) - F ( ¥ ) (cid:181) ( [ ML ] + [ M ( L ) ] ) - k + [ L ] c ( k + isom + k - isom ) (cid:181) A 1 e - (cid:236) 1 t + A 2 e - (cid:236) 2 t ( A24 ) A 1 ) C 1 ( - (cid:236) 1 + k - isom + k + isom k + isom ) / [ C 1 ( - (cid:236) 1 + k - isom + k + isom k + isom ) + C 2 ( - (cid:236) 2 + k - isom + k + isom k + isom ) ] ) (cid:236) 2 ( (cid:236) 1 - k - isom - k + isom ) ( (cid:236) 1 - (cid:236) 2 ) ( k - isom + k + isom ) (cid:24) k + [ L ] k - + k + [ L ] + ( k - k - + k + [ L ] ) ( k - isom k - isom + k + isom ) ( A25 ) A 2 ) C 2 ( - (cid:236) 2 + k - isom + k + isom k + isom ) / [ C 1 ( - (cid:236) 1 + k - isom + k + isom k + isom ) + C 2 ( - (cid:236) 2 + k - isom + k + isom k + isom ) ] ) (cid:236) 1 ( k - isom + k + isom - (cid:236) 2 ) ( (cid:236) 1 - (cid:236) 2 ) ( k - isom + k + isom ) (cid:24) ( k - k - + k + [ L ] ) ( k + isom k - isom + k + isom ) ( A26 ) Scheme A2 d d t { [ M (cid:226) Mg (cid:226) L ] + [ M (cid:226) L ] } ) - k - 1 [ M (cid:226) Mg (cid:226) L ] - k - 2 [ M (cid:226) L ] + k + 1 [ M ] [ Mg (cid:226) L ] + k + 2 [ M ] [ L ] ( A27 ) [ Mg ] [ M (cid:226) L ] ) K Mg [ M (cid:226) Mg (cid:226) L ] ( A28 ) [ Mg ] [ L ] ) K ¢ Mg [ Mg (cid:226) L ] ( A29 ) [ M (cid:226) Mg (cid:226) L ] + [ M (cid:226) L ] ) [ M (cid:226) Mg (cid:226) L ] + ( K Mg [ Mg ] ) [ M (cid:226) Mg (cid:226) L ] ) ( 1 + K Mg [ Mg ] ) [ M (cid:226) Mg (cid:226) L ] ( A30 ) 8838 Biochemistry , Vol . 44 , No . 24 , 2005 Hannemann et al . which can be rearranged to Similarly , we have and Substituting eqs A31 - A34 into eq A27 yields Therefore , Scheme A2 is equivalent to Scheme A3 , where the parentheses are used to indicate a single biochemical state .
