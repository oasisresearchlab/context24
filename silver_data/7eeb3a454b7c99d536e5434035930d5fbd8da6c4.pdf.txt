We propose that integrins are exploited by the gastric pathogen and type - 1 carcinogen Helicobacter pylori for injection of the bacterial oncoprotein cytotoxin - associated gene A ( CagA ) into gastric epithelial cells . Virulent H . pylori express a type - IV secretion pilus that injects CagA into the host cell ; CagA then becomes tyrosine - phosphorylated by Src family kinases . However , the identity of the host cell receptor involved in this process has remained unknown . Here we show that the H . pylori CagL protein is a specialized adhesin that is targeted to the pilus surface , where it binds to and activates integrin a 5 b 1 receptor on gastric epithelial cells through an arginine - glycine - aspartate motif . This interaction triggers CagA delivery into target cells as well as activation of focal adhesion kinase and Src . Our findings provide insights into the role of integrins in H . - pylori - induced pathogenesis . CagL may be exploited as a new molecular tool for our further understanding of integrin signalling . Integrins are cell adhesion receptors that mediate cell – cell , cell – extracellular matrix and cell – pathogen interactions 1 – 7 . Integrins exist as heterodimers of a - and b - subunits ; in mammals there are 18 a - subunits and 8 b - subunits identified that form 24 distinct heterodimers 1 – 4 . Integrin function is dynamically regulated by pro - cesses termed outside - in and inside - out signalling . Integrin - mediated cellular adhesion occurs at sites known as focal adhesions , where integrin signalling is mediated predominantly by the protein tyrosine kinases FAK ( focal adhesion kinase ) and Src 1 – 4 . Deregulation of integrin functions can be associated with diseases including chronic inflammation , heart failure and cancer 1 – 4 . Furthermore , a number of bacteria and viruses have been found to bind integrin receptors for adhesion to or invasion into host cells 5 – 7 . Here we report that the gastric pathogen H . pylori exploits integrin for injection of virulence factors into mammalian cells and simultaneous tyrosine kinase activation . A wide range of Gram - negative bacterial pathogens , including H . pylori , translocate virulence factors into host target cells by multi - subunit transport apparatuses known as type - IV secretion systems 8 , 9 . These type - IV secretion systems , which typically consist of a mem - brane - spanning secretion channel and an extracellular pilus , act as molecular syringes . The type - IV secretion system of H . pylori has attracted considerable interest because it is associated with the development of severe inflammation , peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer in humans 9 – 13 . The H . pylori type - IV secretion , encoded by a 40 - kilobase cag pathogenicity island ( cag PAI ) , injects the CagA onco - protein as well as peptidoglycan into host cells , resulting in activation of NF - k B and induction of potent pro - inflammatory chemokines such as interleukin ( IL ) - 8 ( refs 9 – 13 ) . Translocated CagA undergoes tyrosinephosphorylationbySrc , leadingtoactin - cytoskeletalrearrange - ments , scattering and elongation of infected host cells in cell culture 9 – 13 . These phenotypic changes resemble those of malignant cellular transformation and have been the subject of intensive studies 9 – 13 . The identity of the host cell receptor of the type - IV secre - tion system or the mechanism by which Src is activated during H . pylori infection are , however , unknown , hampering our under - standingofthemolecularmechanismbywhich H . pylori causesgastric ulcer and cancer . Integrin a 5 b 1 is involved in type - IV secretion of CagA To understand the molecular basis of CagA injection , we first inves - tigated the subcellular localization of phosphorylated CagA ( CagA - pY ) shortly after attachment of H . pylori to AGS gastric epithelial cells using an antibody that recognizes CagA phosphorylated at the major phosphorylation site , tyrosine residue Y972 ( ref . 14 , Fig . 1 and Sup - plementary Fig . 1 ) . CagA - pY was found to co - localize with FAK or vinculin at the focal adhesions ( Fig . 1a , arrows , and data not shown ) , suggesting that CagA is either rapidly recruited to or injected across the host plasma membrane at the sites of focal adhesion . This led us to examine whether integrins , which are present in focal adhesions 1 – 4 , might be the host receptors involved in the injection of CagA . The first line of evidence came from the observation that the Escherichia coli strain HB101 that expresses the integrin - b 1 - binding Yersinia invasin InvA ( HB101 invA 1 ) 6 inhibited CagA phosphorylation in AGS cells ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) , whereas wild - type HB101 had no effect on CagA phosphorylation ( data not shown ) . Thus , InvA might be able to block injection of CagA by competing with the type - IV secretion apparatus of H . pylori for binding to integrin b 1 and in particular the b 1 - chain integrin member a 5 b 1 , which is abundantly expressed in AGS cells ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . In accordance with this hypothesis , the integrin b 1 and a 5 function - blocking antibodies AIIB2 and BIIG2 , respectively , inhibited both H . - pylori - induced CagA phosphorylation and AGS cell scattering and elongation ( Supplementary Fig . 2b , c ) , indicating that integrin b 1 and a 5 are 1 Department of Medical Microbiology , and 2 Department of Immunology , Otto von Guericke University , Leipziger Strasse 44 , D - 39120 Magdeburg , Germany . 3 Department of Chemistry , Organic and Bioorganic Chemistry , Bielefeld University , Universita¨tsstrasse 25 , D - 33615 Bielefeld , Germany . 4 Helmholtz Center for Infection Research , Department of Microbial Pathogenesis , Inhoffen Strasse 7 , D - 38124 Braunschweig , Germany . 5 Paul Ehrlich Institute , Paul - Ehrlich - Strasse 51 - 59 , D - 63225 Langen , Germany . 6 Max Delbru¨ck Center for Molecular Medicine , Robert - Roessle - Strasse 10 , D - 13125 Berlin , Germany . 7 Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology , Spemannstrasse 35 , D - 72076 Tu¨bingen , Germany . { Present addresses : University of Zu¨rich , Institute of Medical Virology , Gloriastrasse 30 / 32 , CH - 8006 Zu¨rich , Switzerland ( T .

Furthermore , no phos - phorylation of CagA was seen in H . - pylori - infected integrin - b 1 knockout mouse fibroblasts ( GD25 ) 15 , whereas CagA phosphoryla - tion was restored in GD25 fibroblasts in which integrin b 1 was re - expressed ( GD25 b 1A ) ( Fig . 1b ) . The presence of CagA and CagA - pY in the cytosol of infected GD25 b 1A cells but not GD25 cells ( Fig . 1b ) further confirms that integrin a 5 b 1 is required for the type - IV secre - tion and phosphorylation of CagA during H . pylori infection of host target cells . CagL is expressed on type - IV secretion pili Many integrin ligands such as fibronectin and vitronectin carry the arginine - glycine - aspartate ( RGD ) motif , which serves as a recog - nition site for integrins 1 – 4 . Sequence analysis indicated that CagL , a protein highly conserved among pathogenic H . pylori strains , is the only cag PAI - encoded gene product that contains an RGD motif ( Fig . 2a ) . Deletion of cagL significantly diminished the ability of H . pylori to induce secretion of IL - 8 by host cells 12 , indicating that CagL is essential for pathogenesis . We postulated that CagL might function as an interacting partner of integrin b 1 during type - IV secre - tion . Immunofluorescence microscopy and scanning electron micro - scopy ( FESEM ) showed that CagL is indeed expressed on the surface of H . pylori ( Fig . 2b , c ) . Notably , within only 30min of contact of H . pylori with AGS cells , numerous needle - like pili ( 100 – 200nm in length ) appeared on the bacterium in a CagL - and RGD - dependent manner ( Fig . 2d – f and Supplementary Fig . 4a – c ) . CagL was found abundantly on these pili . Representative examples from 60 randomly selected pili are shown ( Fig . 2d and Supplementary Fig . 5a ) ; they are reminiscent of the agrobacterial and H . pylori type - IV secretion appa - ratus 8 , 9 , 16 . These structures were clearly not flagella , because pilus formation and CagL surface exposure were also observed in infections withtheflagella - deficient mutant H . pylori D flaA ( data notshown ) . In contrast , neither pilus formation nor CagL surface expression was seen in infections with D virB7 , D virB10 or D virB11 , H . pylori mutants that are defective in type - IV secretion ( data not shown ) . Results of immunogold labelling showed the presence of CagA signals at the tips of these pili , supporting the theory that CagA is delivered through these surface appendages ( Fig . 2e and Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . Taken together , thesefindingsledustoproposethatCagLmayfunctioninan RGD - dependent manner as a sensor or adhesin on the H . pylori type - IV secretion pilus surface to trigger the injection of CagA on contact with host cells . Functional role of CagL and its RGD motif To investigate whether the RGD motif in CagL has a functional role in the injection of CagA , we infected AGS gastric epithelial cells with wild - type H . pylori and cagL mutants . A single amino acid substi - tution in the RGD motif , where either the aspartate or glycine residue is substituted by an alanine residue ( CagL ( RGA ) or CagL ( RAD ) , respectively ) , was sufficient to abolish CagA translocation into the cytosol , tyrosine phosphorylation of CagA , as well as the elongation phenotype ( Fig . 3a – d ) . Complementation of the H . pylori D cagL deletion mutant with wild - type cagL , but not cagL ( RGA ) or cagL ( RAD ) mutants , restored the various phenotypes ( Fig . 3a – d ) . These observations suggest that the RGD motif of CagL has an essen - tial role in translocation and tyrosine phosphorylation of CagA . Furthermore , the CagL - derived RGD peptide c - ( - Arg - Gly - Asp - D - Leu - Ala - ) , but not the control RAD peptide c - ( - Arg - Ala - Asp - D - Leu - Ala - ) , complemented the ability of the H . pylori cagL ( RAD ) mutant by approximately 40 – 50 % in triggering phosphorylation of CagA and phenotypic responses ( Fig . 3d ) , as well as pili formation ( Supplementary Fig . 4d ) .

They rule out the scenario where CagA is translocated by an RGD - motif - independent mechanism and the RGD peptide merely induces phosphorylation of the translocated CagA . CagL binds integrin a 5 b 1 in an RGD - dependent manner Recombinant wild - type CagL bound to purified integrin a 5 b 1 with a higher affinity ( dissociation constant ( K d ) of 0 . 09 6 0 . 02 m M ) and higher association and dissociation rates as compared with mutant CagL ( RGA ) ( K d of 0 . 36 6 0 . 11 m M ) ( Fig . 4a and Supplementary Figs 6 and 7 ) . These observations suggest that CagL is able to interact directly with purified integrin a 5 b 1 in vitro in an RGD - motif - specific manner . The affinities and specificities of integrin – ligand interac - tions in vivo , in contrast to those in vitro , are influenced by factors such as inside - out signalling , integrin clustering and receptor crosstalk 1 – 4 . Indeed , CagL bound to cell - surface - expressed integrin a 5 b 1 with even greater affinity and specificity as compared with the in vitro interaction , as indicated by the following observations . First , latex beads coated with CagL bound abundantly to AGS cells but only poorly to integrin - b 1 knockdown cells ( Fig . 4b and Supplementary Fig . 8a – c ) . Second , the binding of CagL ( RGA ) - coated latex beads to AGS cells was significantly reduced as compared to wild - type CagL ( Supplementary Fig . 8a – c ) . Third , CagL - coated beads co - localized with integrin b 1 on binding to AGS cells ( Supplementary Fig . 9a ) , whereas the integrin b 1 signal was often weak or undetectable with CagL ( RGA ) - coated beads ( Supplementary Fig . 9a , right panel ) . Fourth , the function - blocking antibodies BIIG2 and AIIB2 against a 5 b 1 integrins as well as the CagL - derived RGD peptide , but not the control RAD peptide , inhibited binding of CagL to AGS cells ( Supplementary Fig . 9b , c ) . Fifth , invasion of E . coli HB101 invA 1 into AGS cells , which requires integrin b 1 ( ref . 6 ) , was blocked by pre - infection of AGS cells with wild - type H . pylori , but not with the cagL deletion mutant ( D cagL ) or the cagL ( RGA ) mutant ( Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . These various findings show conclusively that CagL uses its RGD motif to interact with the surface receptor integrin a 5 b 1 on eukaryotic host cells , and support the hypothesis that CagL triggers type - IV secretion and phosphorylation of CagA through direct inter - action with integrin a 5 b 1 .

ARTICLES NATURE | Vol 449 | 18 October 2007 864 Nature ©2007 PublishingGroup CagL activates FAK and Src tyrosine kinases Analyses of bound CagL - coated latex beads on integrin - b 1 - positive cells at higher resolution showed that CagL beads triggered mem - brane ruffles on the host cell surface as well as intimate contact with the host cell membrane , whereas beads coated with the CagL ( RGA ) mutant exhibited only limited contact with the host surface ( Fig . 4c , arrows ) . These observations support the view that CagL functions as a specialized adhesin that not only anchors the type - IV secretion apparatus to the host surface through binding to integrin , but also promotes signal transduction . These features of CagL complement the fundamental bacterial adherence functions of the two canonical H . pylori adhesins BabA and SabA 17 , 18 during H . pylori infections . To understand further the downstream signalling of the CagL – integrin interaction , we examined the ability of CagL to trigger activation of FAK , as the latter is a key sensor of integrin engagement . On activa - tion , FAK is autophosphorylated at tyrosine residue Y397 , which then serves as a high - affinity binding site for the SH2 domain of Src , resulting in an active FAK – Src signalling complex 2 . Our results show that both the infection of AGS cells with H . pylori expressing wild - type CagL andincubation of AGS cells with the RGD peptide led to transient activation of FAK and Src , as indicated by the accumula - tion of phosphorylated FAK - pY397 and Src - pY418 , respectively ( Fig . 5a , c and Supplementary Fig . 11a ) .

The illustrated type - IV secretion assembly mechanism is based on homology to the prototypical agrobacterial system , which is composed of 11 VirB proteins ( B1 – 11 ) and the so - called coupling protein VirD4 ( D4 ) 8 , 9 , 12 , as indicated . The H . pylori type - IV secretion apparatus consists of up to 32 proteins including VirB / D homologues and proteins of as - yet - unknown functions such as CagL 12 . In the absence of host contact , CagL is delivered to the bacterial surface or even specifically to the surface of the type - IV secretion pilus ( steps 1 – 2 ) . During infection , H . pylori establishes contact with the host cell . Surface - located CagL then binds to the transmembrane receptor integrin a 5 b 1 ( step 3 ) . This interaction stimulates pili elongation by an unknown mechanism ( step 4 ) . Meanwhile , binding of pilus - locatedCagLthroughitsRGDmotiftohostintegrin a 5 b 1 activatesthis receptor ( step 5 ) . Activated integrin a 5 b 1 triggers downstream signalling , leading to activation / phosphorylation of both FAK and Src kinases ( step 6 ) , which subsequently induce actin - cytoskeletal rearrangements , plasma - membrane dynamics and possibly clustering of integrins and activation of other receptors . These changes are important with regard to injecting CagA from the pilus into the host cell cytoplasm ( step 7 ) . Finally , activated Src mediates tyrosine phosphorylation of translocated CagA ( step 8 ) , which then stimulates downstream signalling , leading to cell elongation or induction of IL - 8 ( step 9 ) . NATURE | Vol 449 | 18 October 2007 ARTICLES 865 Nature ©2007 PublishingGroup Src coincided with the occurrence of CagA - pY in infected cells ( Supplementary Fig . 11a ) , indicating that FAK activation and sub - sequently the activation of Src rapidly results in tyrosine phosphoryl - ation of CagA . In contrast , activation of FAK and Src was seen neither with the H . pylori CagL ( RGA ) mutant nor the RAD peptide control ( Fig . 5b , c and Supplementary Fig . 11b ) , indicating that the RGD motif of CagL has a crucial role in the activation of FAK and Src . Discussion Taken together , we have shown that CagL is able to act bi - functionally to hijack host integrin receptors for injection of virulence factors into eukaryotic cells as well as to activate host tyrosine kinases . We propose that this elegant mechanism allows CagL to not only promote receptor - dependent translocation of CagA but also activate concomitantly the tyrosine phosphorylation of CagA at the site of injection ( Fig . 6 ) . Whether the CagL - mediated signalling might facil - itate type - IVsecretionbyalteringmembranedynamicsisanintriguing proposition to be investigated further . Notably , the observation that both integrin b 1 function - blocking antibody and knockdown of integ - rin b 1 markedly reduced the number of elongated H . pylori pili ( Supplementary Fig . 4e , f ) suggests that interaction of integrin b 1 with CagL is important for the formation of visible type - IV secretion pili ( Fig . 6 ) . Furthermore , the CagL - derived RGD peptide only partially complemented the H . pylori cagL ( RAD ) mutant in the induction of type - IV secretion and phosphorylation of CagA , and failed to complement the D cagL deletion mutant in these functions ( Fig . 3d ) , indicating that a direct contact between integrin a 5 b 1 and CagL on H . pylori is likely to be essential for full type - IV secretion function , and that other amino acids apart from the RGD motif in CagL also have a function in activating type - IV secretion and phosphorylation of CagA . We have demonstrated a previously unidentified role of integrin a 5 b 1 in microbial pathogenesis , making integrin a 5 b 1 the first human receptor shown to be exploited by a human bacterial pathogen for type - IV secretion of virulence factors into mammalian cells . Our findings support an intriguing mechanism by which the H . pylori type - IV secretion system , through activation of integrin a 5 b 1 by the pilus - located adhesin and sensor molecule CagL , ensures phos - phorylation of translocated CagA directly at the site of injection at focal adhesions and subsequently promotes downstream signalling in the host cell . Given that integrin a 5 b 1 preferentially localizes to the basolateral surface of polarized epithelial cells , we propose that H . pylori disruptscell – celljunctionsandinvadesbetweencellstocome into contact with integrins 10 , 19 . Although this study provides clear evidence that a 5 b 1 integrin is a principal molecule in the interaction with CagL and type - IV secretion of CagA , the data presented do not preclude the possibility that other integrin receptors expressed on AGS cells might potentially also be involved in the binding of CagL to AGS cells . However , the notion that the type - IV secretion system functions through specific recognition of a host cell receptor adds a new dimension to our understanding of H . pylori pathogenesis , and opens up new opportunities for investigating type - IV - secretion - mediated protein translocation in general . The fact that CagL acti - vates host tyrosine kinases and engages integrin a 5 b 1 for triggering type - IV secretion provides new insights into the molecular basis of H . - pylori - induced malignancy . CagL might be a novel drug target for combating the severe gastric diseases caused by cag PAI - positive H . pylori strains .

The human gastric adenocarcinomacelllineAGS 14 , 20 , theintegrin b 1 - deficientGD25cellsandGD25 cells re - expressing integrin b 1 A ( GD25 b 1A ) have been described 15 . AGS cells stably expressing short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) targeting integrin b 1 RNA ( AGS Db 1 knockdown cells ) or control cells expressing shRNA specific for firefly luciferase - GL2 RNA were generated by retroviral transduction . Knockdown of integrin b 1 was verified using standard flow cytometry ( FACS - Calibur , BD Biosciences ) and immunoblotting . H . pylori strains P1 , P12 and their isogenic mutants P1 D cagL , P1 D flaA , P1 D virB7 , P1 D virB10 , P1 D virB11 , P1 D cagA / cagA ( WT ) , P1 D cagA / cagA ( Y972F ) or P12 D cag PAI have been reported pre - viously 14 , 20 . Cloning , mutagenesis and genetic complementation of cagL was done using standard procedures 14 . Cell monolayers were infected with H . pylori as described 14 , 20 . The number of infected AGS cells exhibiting elongation pheno - typewasquantifiedintendifferent0 . 25 - mm 2 fields . Todeterminethenumberof intracellular bacteria , gentamicin protection assayswere performed 20 . The num - ber of intracellular bacteria ( colony - forming units , c . f . u . ) was obtained in three independent experiments . The preparation of membrane / nuclear and cytoplas - mic fractions of infected AGS cells has been described previously 14 . In vitro phosphorylation assays with recombinant Src ( Upstate ) was performed as described previously 21 . Synthetic peptides , antibodies and western blotting . The cyclic peptides were synthesized as previously described 22 . The following antibodies were used : rabbit polyclonal anti - H . pylori antibody ( Biomeda ) ; AIIB2 and BIIG2 specific for b 1 and a 5 integrin , respectively ( Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank ) ; anti - integrin a v b 3 ( clone LM609 , Chemicon ) ; monoclonal anti - CagA antibody ( AustralBiologicals ) ; FITC - conjugated mouse anti - human integrin b 1 , rabbit anti - human integrin b 1 antibody and monoclonal anti - vinculin ( all from Santa Cruz ) . The mouse anti - CagL , rabbit anti - CagA and anti - urease antisera against the purified proteins were prepared by Biogenes . The rabbit anti - CagA - pY972 antibody was produced using a peptide - based antigen ( H - VGLSASPEPIpYAT , Jerini ) . Westernblottingwasperformedasdescribed 14 , 20 . Toexaminethetype - IV secretion and phosphorylation of CagA during infections , total lysate of infected cells or the corresponding membrane and cytosol fractions were analysed by immunoblotting with anti - pY99 ( Santa Cruz ) . Blots were probed sequentially with anti - CagA and anti - CagL antibodies to ensure equal amounts of bacteria in each lane . To rule out the possibility that the cytosolic fractions were contami - nated with H . pylori proteins , all blots were probed with anti - urease 14 . The pre - senceof urease inthemembranefractionsofinfectedAGScellsisduetoattached H . pylori . Band intensities were quantified with the Lumi - Imager F1 ( Roche Diagnostics ) . Images were processed for contrast and brightness using Adobe Photoshop ( version 6 . 0 ) . OverexpressionandpurificationofCagLproteins . Toconstructthevectorsfor overexpression of wild - type CagL or CagL ( RGA ) in E . coli , a DNA fragment corresponding to amino acid residues 21 – 237 of the protein ( minus the pre - dicted signal peptide ) was amplified by PCR and ligated into pET - 28a vector . CagL proteins were purified as follows : E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) transformed with the corresponding overexpression plasmids were grown in LB medium at 37 u C for 2h with shaking . Bacterial pellets were re - suspended in ice - cold buffer CW ( 50mM KH 2 PO 4 - K 2 HPO 4 , pH7 . 5 , 200mM NaCl ) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) . After sonication , the overexpressed CagL present in the inclusion bodies was solubilized in buffer LW ( 50mM KH 2 PO 4 - K 2 HPO 4 , pH7 . 5 , 200mM NaCl , 6Mguanidine hydrochloride ) and refolded in ice - cold refolding buffer ( 52mM Tris - HCl , pH8 . 2 , 20mM NaCl , 834 m M KCl , 1 . 1mM EDTA , 2 . 1mM reduced glutathione , 210 m M oxidized glutathione ) . After refolding , CagL was further purified by metal - chelate affinity chromatography through Talon resin ( BD Biosciences ) and gel filtration in buffer CW through Sephacryl S - 200 ( 16 / 60 , Amersham Biosciences ) to . 95 % homogeneity . The folded conformations of the purified CagL and CagL ( RGA ) were confirmed by circular dichroism 23 using a J - 720 spectropolarimeter ( Jasco Instruments ) . Cell attachment a ssays and binding of ligand - coated latex beads . Cell attach - ment assays were performed according to procedures described previously 24 . Latex beads ( 1 . 1 m m in diameter , Sigma ) were coated with CagL or CagL ( RGA ) mutant protein as follows : the beads were incubated with protein ligand ( 1mgml 2 1 ) in coupling buffer ( 50mM MES pH6 . 1 , 200mM NaCl ) at 4 u C overnight . Beads were then washed with coupling buffer and nonspecific sites were blocked with 2 % BSA for 1h . AGS cell monolayer was co - incubated withprotein - coatedlatexbeadsatanapproximatecell : beadratioof1 : 100for3h . After washing with RPMI , cells were fixed with 3 . 8 % paraformaldehyde . Binding of CagL to integrin a 5 b 1 determined by surface plasmon resonance . Purified integrin a 5 b 1 ( Chemicon ) was immobilized by amino coupling to the surfaceofaCM5carboxymethyldextransensorchip . Theanalysiswasperformed as described previously 22 . Data were processed using Biaevaluation software ( version 4 . 1 ) . Immunofluorescence staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy . Immunofluorescencestaining withdifferent antibodiesas shownin each experi - ment was performed as described 14 , 20 . Samples were analysed using a Leica TCS SP2 confocal laser scanning microscope system equipped with a DM - IRE2 microscope and different lasers ( Leica Microsystems ) . To avoid spectral overlap and channel crosstalk , FITC , TRITC , CY5 and Alexa - 350 fluorophores were excited sequentially with argon - laser ( 488nm ) , green helium ( 543nm ) , red helium ( 633nm ) and ultraviolet laser ( 364nm ) . DAPI ( 4 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ) staining was used to visualize DNA . Field and immunofield emission scanning electron microscopy ( FESEM ) . Procedures for the FESEM of H . pylori and H . - pylori - infected AGS cells were carried out as described previously 16 . For immuno - FESEM of CagL , H . pylori samples were incubated with rabbit anti - CagL IgG antibodies ( 100 m g IgG pro - tein per ml ) followed by incubation with 15 - nm protein - A - coated gold particles as described 16 . H . - pylori - infected AGS samples on cover slips were incubated with rabbit anti - CagL IgG antibodies ( 100 m g IgG protein per ml ) for 1h at 30 u C , followedbywashinginPBSandincubationwith15 - nmprotein - A - coated gold particles , or samples were incubated with mouse anti - CagA antibodies followed by 15 - nm anti - mouse IgG - coated gold particles . All samples were coated with a thin carbon film . Statistical analysis . All data were evaluated using the Student’s t - test with SigmaStat statistical software ( version 2 . 0 ) . Statistical significance was defined by P # 0 . 01 ( asterisk ) and P # 0 . 001 ( double asterisk ) . 20 . Kwok , T . et al .
