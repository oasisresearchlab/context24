Canada V5A 1S6 Received : 10 May 1993 / Accepted : 28 July 1993 Abstract . Mutations in the uric - 60 gene of the nematode Caenorhabditis eIegans result in paralysis . The thin fila - ments of the muscle cells are severely disorganized and not bundled with myosin into functional contractile units . Here we report the cloning and sequence of unc - 60 . Two unc - 60 transcripts , 1 . 3 and 0 . 7 kb in size , were de - tected . The transcripts share a single exon encoding only the initial methionine , yet encode proteins with ho - mologous sequences . The predicted protein products are 165 and 152 amino acids in length and their sequences are 38 % identical . Both proteins are homologous to a family of actin depolymerizing proteins identified in ver - tebrate , plant and protozoan systems . We propose that the unc - 60 locus encodes proteins that depolymerize growing actin filaments in muscle cells , and that these proteins are required for the assembly of actin filaments into the contractile myofilament lattice of C . elegans muscle , unc - 60 has an essential function in development , since one unc - 60 allele , s1586 , has a recessive lethal phe - notype . Our characterization ofsi586 has shown that it is a small deletion which disrupts both coding regions . Key words : Caenorhabditis elegans - unc - 60 - Muscle - Actin - binding protein Introduction Muscle structure in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has striking similarities to vertebrate muscle ( reviewed in Waterston t988 ) . The force of contraction is generated by the interaction between the myosin - containing thick filaments and the actin - containing thin filaments within a unit analogous to the vertebrate sarcomere . The thin filaments are attached to dense bodies , analogous to Communicated by B . Judd * Present address : Department of Genetics , University of Califor - nia , Davis , CA 95616 , USA Correspondence to : D . Baillie vertebrate Z lines , and interdigitate with the thick fila - ments which are centrally stacked in the sarcomere . An electron - dense material analogous to the vertebrate M line is also present . While there are also significant dif - ferences , the similarities to vertebrate muscle make C . eleoans an attractive model system for the study of muscle structure and function . Genetic analysis has identified more than 30 genes involved in muscle development and function ( Waterston 1988 ) . Most of these genes were identified through the isolation of mutants exhibiting impaired movement due to the dysfunction of muscle contraction ( Brenner 1974 ) . These genes encode components required for muscle structure and function . Many of these genes have known homologs in vertebrate muscle , unc - 54 , for example , en - codes one of the four myosin isoforms , uric - 22 ( Benian et al . 1989 ) is similar to the proteins titin and projectin , and unc - 52 encodes a protein that resembles perlecan ( Rogalski et al . 1993 ) . The genetic and molecular ana - lyses of unc - 54 , unc - 22 and unc - 52 have provided insights into the possible functions of the related proteins in vertebrate and insect systems . Structural analysis with polarized light and electron microscopy ( Waterston et al . 1980 ) has revealed the de - fects in the body wall muscle resulting from mutations in many C . elegans muscle genes . These data allow the genes to be classified according to their mutant phenotypes ( Waterston 1988 ) . Mutations in unc - 54 affect thick fila - ment organization , consistent with the fact that unc - 54 encodes the major body wall myosin . Three genes , other than the actin genes , are known to be involved in the formation of functional thin filaments . These genes are unc - 78 , uric - 94 and unc - 60 ( Waterston 1988 ) . In unc - 60 mutants , large aggregates of thin filaments are found at the ends of the body wall muscle cells ( Waterston et al . 1980 ) , but the thick filaments are almost normal . Previous genetic characterization of this gene resulted in the identification of eleven alleles ( Brenner 1974 ; McKim et al . 1988 ; Johnsen and Baillie 1991 ; M . F . Wakarchuk , unpublished results ) and these have been used to generate a recombination - based fine structure map ( McKim et al . 1988 ) . Here we report the cloning and sequence of unc - 60 . The predicted protein products en - coded by the unc - 60 gene are homologous to a family of actin - binding proteins . These proteins function to poly - merize and depolymerize actin , a role consistent with the unc - 60 mutant phenotype . Materials and methods Genetics . The C . elegans strains used in this study were derived from the wild - type N2 strain ( var . Bristol ) . The C . br ( qgsae strain G16 was obtained from the Caenor - habditis Genetics Center ( Columbia , MO . ) . All the defi - ciencies used in this study were described previously ( Fig . 1 ) ( Rosenbluth et al . 1988 ; Johnsen and Baillie 1991 ; Stewart et al . 1991 ) . Deficiency homozygotes were generated for polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) by cross - ing unc - 46 ( e177 ) / + + males to sDfx uric - 46 ; dpy - 18 / eT1 ( IIl ; V ) hermaphrodites . The Unc - 46 progeny were set on plates for 12 - 24 h and then removed . Two to three days later the arrested progeny ( either embryos or larvae ) were collected for PCR analysis . Polymerase chain reaction procedures . PCR amplifica - tions were carried out in 25 gl volumes . For amplification from the deficiency homozygotes , we used a procedure developed by Barstead and Waterston ( 1991 ) . The arrest - ed larval homozygotes were placed on the lid of a 0 . 5 ml Eppendorf tube containing 2 . 5 gl of lysis buffer ( 50 mM KC1 , 10 mM TRIS pH 8 . 2 , 2 . 5 mM MgCI2 , 0 . 45 % NP - 40 , 0 . 45 % Tween 20 , 0 . 01 % gelatin , 10 pg / ml proteinase K ) . The deficiency homozygotes that arrested as embryos were first taken up in chitinase solution [ 20 mg / ml chiti - nase ( Sigma ) , 50raM NaCI , 70raM KC1 , 2 . 5raM MgCI ; , 2 . 5 mM CaCI : ] with a drawn - out capillary tube , and then placed in the lysis buffer . The 0 . 5 ml Eppendorf tubes were then spun briefly , frozen at - 70 ° C for 10 min and then incubated at 65 ° C for 60 rain . After incubation for 15 rain at 95 ° C to inactivate the proteinase K , the rest of the PCR components were added [ final reaction con - centrations were : 25 - 50pmol of each primer , 10 mM , < - o ~ t , - - ~ ' ~ ~ C ~ ' ~ - ~ . 0 ~ ~ 6 ~ 6 ~ = ~ = E ~ ~ lug ( 1 sDf75 sDf ~ 2 ~ ~ sD ( 42 , ~ ~ s ~ f33 ~ 56 , sDf28 sDf34 ~ ~ sDf74 { ~ o ¢ . q ~ ~ J ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ t ~ c ~ ~ - , ~ - ~ ~ ~ ~ 6 ~ 6 ~ ~ ~ ~ = g ~ ~ = ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 1 mu Fig . 1 . Genetic map of the left half of chromosome V , modified from Johnsen and Baillie ( 1991 ) and Stewart et aL ( 1991 ) . Relevant deficiencies are shown below the genetic map . Deficiency endpoints are indicated by vertical bars . The scale bar corresponds to one map unit 347 TRIS pH 8 . 3 , 50 mM KC1 , 1 . 5 mM MgC12 , 0 . 001 % gela - tin , 0 . 125 mM of each NTP , 0 . 25 units Taq polymerase ( Cetus ) ] . Typically PCR was initiated by denaturing at 95 ° C for 10 rain , annealing for t rain at 58 ° C and poly - merizing at 72 ° C for 2 min . For the succeeding 25 cycles , denaturation time was reduced to 1 rain , and in the final cycle , polymerization was carried out for 10 rain . Generation of primers . Primers for PCR were generated from the sequence of cosmid subclones . The cosmids were subcloned into pBluescript ( Stratagene ) using either HindIII - or EcoRI + HindIII - cut mini - prep DNA . The primers were designed from the sequence obtained using T3 and T7 primers , with the aid of the OLIGO program ( Rychlik and Rhoads 1989 ) . General molecular biology methods . Genomic DNA was prepared by a method modified by J . Curran and D . L . Baillie from that of Emmons et al . ( 1979 ) . The details are described in Starr et al . ( 1989 ) . Restriction digestions of ~ 5 l ~ g of genomic DNA were carried out under con - ditions recommended by the enzyme manufacturers ( BRL or Pharmacia ) . The digested DNA was electro - phoresed in 0 . 7 % agarose gels and then transferred to Genebind ( Pharmacia ) or Genescreen ( DuPont ) mem - branes with 10× SSC . Probes were 32P - labelled using random priming ( Feinberg and Vogelstein 1984 ) , Alter - natively , probes were labelled and hybridization detected using the ECL Random Prime labelling and detection systems ( Amersham ) . The nylon membranes were hy - bridized with the probe overnight at 65 ° C in 5 × SSPE , 0 . 3 % SDS , 2 . 5×Denhardt ' s . For high stringency , the filters were washed in 0 . 2 × SSPE , 0 . 2 % SDS at 68 ° C for 1 h . For low stringency , which was used for cross - species hybridization , the filters were washed in 2 × or 5 × SSPE , 0 . 2 % SDS at 65 ° C for 1 h . The restriction map of F53E2 was generated in two steps . First , all the SaII , PstI and HindIII fragments from F53E2 were subcloned into pBluescript ( Stratagene ) . Second , we used Southern hybridization to determine the fragment overlaps . DNA sequencing was by the dideoxy chainterminator method of Sanger ( 1977 ) using either Sequenase 2 . 0 ( US - Biochemicals ) or automated sequencing on an Applied Biosystems ( ABI ) Model 373A automated sequencing machine using protocols supplied by ABI . DNA was prepared using the alkaline lysis method . DNA to be manually sequenced was purified with Pharmacia Mini - prep Spun Columns . Cycle sequencing reactions ( ABI ) were used for the ABI automated sequencer , and purified DNA was not required . Cosmid subclones in pBluescript were used for the analysis of genomic DNA . The cDNA clones were isolated from a Lambda ZAP library ( Strata - gene ) constructed by Barstead and Waterston ( 1989 ) . Exonuclease III - generated deletions ( Henikoff 1987 ) of genomic or cDNA clones for sequencing were prepared using the Erase - a - Base system ( Promega ) . For Northern blots , 30 gg of total RNA isolated from N2 animals were separated on a 1 . 2 % agarose gel and blotted to Genescreen ( DuPont ) . Filters were prehy - bridized and then hybridized with the probe overnight at 348 68 ° C in 5 x SSPE , 0 . 3 % SDS , and 5 x Denhardt ' s . Filters were washed twice with agitation at 68 ° C in 0 . 4 % SDS and 1 x SSPE for 5 min and then 30 rain . Germline transformation . Experiments were performed using an inverted Zeiss microscope with Nomarski op - tics . Two methods were used to perform germline trans - formations . In the first method ( Fire 1986 ) , nematodes were immobilized on agarose pads and individual mature oocytes were injected . In the second method ( Mello et al . 1991 ) , DNA was injected into the gonadal syncytium . Most DNA preparations for germline transformation experiments were mixed with the plasmid pRf4 contain - ing the dominant Roller allele rol - 6 ( sulO06 ) ( Kramer et al . 1990 ) . The Roller gene acted as a marker for trans - formation . Cosmid and plasmid DNAs used for germline transformation were prepared by the alkaline lysis procedure ( Sambrook et al . 1989 ) . DNA was purified by either repeated ethanol precipitation , CsC1 density cen - trifugation , or Miniprep Spun Columns ( Pharmacia ) . Purified DNA for germline transformation was mixed with Fire ' s ( 1986 ) injection solution or TE buffer ( 10 mM TRIS - HCI , 1 mM EDTA pH 8 ) or double - distilled sterile H20 at 100 ng / gl . DNA sequence analysis . Nucleotide sequences were align - ed , formatted and translated using the Eyeball Sequence Editor ( ESEE ) program ( Cabot and Beckenbach 1989 ) . Amino acid sequences predicted using ESEE were used to search entries in the SwissProt , PIR , GenPept , and GPUpdate peptide sequence databases , using the BLAST algorithm ( Altschul et al . 1990 ) . Computations were performed at the National Center for Biotechnol - ogy Information ( NCBI ) using the BLAST network ser - vice . ges - 1 emb - 29 uric - 34 let - ? let - 326 unc - 60 I I I I I I sDfSe sDf74 - I sDf32 t ~ sDf42 I sOf28 sDf34 sO f33 1 t sDf75 I 4 I I I I I I I I i I % . Fig . 2 . Physical mapping in the unc - 60 region . The genetic map is shown on top , with the deficiencies in the middle and the cosmid contigs on the bottom . Only the cosmids from which DNA sequen - ces were obtained in order to design primers for PCR amplifications are indicated on the contigs by vertical lines . Other cosmids have been left out . The gaps between the contigs are joined by YAC clones ( Coulson et al . 1988 ) . The starred cosmids contain unc - 60 ( + ) activity , as determined by transformation rescue experi - ments . F53E2 is deleted with respect to C32E5 Results Alignment of the physical and genetic maps in the unc - 60 region On the genetic map , unc - 60 is located near the left end of chromosome V . Deficiency mapping has placed it between let - 326 and emb - 29 ( Fig . 1 ) . ges - 1 is within 1 cM of unc - 60 ( McGhee and Cotrell 1986 ) and is deleted by sDf74 ( McGhee et al . 1990 ) . An array of overlapping cosmids and yeast artificial chromosomes from the re - gion ( " contigs " ; Fig . 2 ) has been constructed ( Coulson et al . 1986 ; 1988 ) . ges - 1 has been cloned , and is located on cosmid C29B10 ( Kennedy et al . 1993 ) . In order to align the genetic and physical maps of the unc - 60 region , we examined genetically identified deft - ciencies of the region ( Fig . 1 ) using PCR and primers derived from cosmid sequences ( see Materials and meth - ods ) . Deficiency homozygotes , arrested in development as embryos or early stage larvae , were used in the PCR amplifications ( see Materials and methods ) . If the defi - ciency deleted at least one of a primer pair ' s annealing sites , an amplification product would not be observed . If the deficiency deleted neither primer annealing site , an amplification product would be observed . A primer pair from another region of chromosome V or another chro - mosome was included in each reaction as a positive control . The results are shown in Fig . 2 .

The X denotes the cDNA that resembles UBF1 and nucleolin ; the exact position of the cDNA within the restriction fragment is not known . Only a portion of the entire 6 . 0 kb SalI fragment used to detect this cDNA is shown . The stippled box bordered by parentheses indicates that a portion of F53E2 is deleted with respect to the other cosmid that rescues unc - 60 , C32E5 . The deletion s1586 was detected using a combina - tion of PCR and Southern blot analysis . Three primer pairs were used to amplify all of transcript A . One pair , flanking the 3 ' UTR ( see Fig . 6 ) , did not amplify DNA from s1586 homozygotes . Res - triction enzyme sites are : S , SalI ; H , HindlII ; P , PstI ; B , BamHI .

M indicates the methionine that initiates both the Unc - 60A and Unc - 60B proteins A primer pair from the cosmid K06H5 maps between sDf74 and sDf42 , in the same region as emb - 29 . A primer pair from F16B4 maps inside sDf42 . These data orient the rightmost contig with respect to the genetic map as shown in Fig . 2 . To determine which cosmid clone con - tained the unc - 60 gene , we transformed unc - 60 ( m35 ) hermaphrodites with cosmid clones from the 9es - 1 re - gion . Two overlapping cosmids , F53E2 and C32E5 , were found to rescue unc - 60 ( m35 ) mutants ( Fig . 2 ) . Since these two cosmids lie to the right of the cosmid carrying # es - 1 ( cosmid C29B10 ; Kennedy et al . 1993 ) , we have positioned unc - 60 to the right of # es - 1 on the genetic map . Characterization of F53E2 and C32E5 by Southern blotting revealed that F53E2 is deleted with respect to C32E5 . We have concluded that the deletion is in the 6 . 0 kb SalI fragment , a portion of which is indicated in the restriction map of F53E2 ( Fig . 3 ) , because this frag - ment hybridized to two large SalI fragments on Southern blots containing C32E5 and C . elegans genomic DNA . Because F53E2 is deleted with respect to C32E5 , yet still rescues unc - 60 ( m35 ) mutant animals , we chose to use it as our unc - 60 cloning source . Identification of conserved sequences and coding regions near unc - 60 In an effort to identify coding regions in the vicinity of unc - 60 , we employed the technique of inter - species hy - bridization . It has been shown that coding regions can be detected using hybridization to closely related Caenor - habditis species ( Snutch 1984 ; Heine and Blumenthal 349 1986 ; Prasad and Baillie 1989 ) . Restriction fragments from F53E2 were used to probe Southern blots contain - ing DNA from C . elegans and the closely related Caenor - habditis briqgsae . To our surprise , most of the probes hybridized at low stringency to a family of C . eleqans and C . briqgsae fragments . Based on hybridization patterns , there are at least three different families of repetitive DNA in this cosmid ( data not shown ) , and their se - quences are conserved across species boundaries . Only one region of F53E2 , represented by a 4 . 8 kb Pstl frag - ment ( pCes 902 ) and a 5 . 0 kb HindIII fragment ( pCes 777 ; Fig . 3 ) , contained no repetitive DNA . Both of these fragments hybridized to single - copy sequences on South - ern blots containing C . elegans and C . briqgsae genomic DNA ( see Fig . 4 for the pCes 902 result ) . As described below , these fragments contain the unc - 60 coding region . Using an alternative search strategy for coding re - gions , we screened a cDNA library [ obtained from Bar - stead and Waterston ( 1989 ) ] using restriction fragments from F53E2 as probes . The positive cDNA clones ob - tained were analyzed by Southern blotting and DNA sequencing . Based on hybridization results , we identified three classes of cDNA clones . The positions of the cDNA clones on the F53E2 restriction map are shown in Fig . 3 . The analysis described below identified the transcripts labelled unc - 60 A and unc - 60 B in Fig . 3 as products of the unc - 60 gene . One positive clone was identified in a screen of 50 000 phage using the 6 . 0 kb Sail fragment as a probe ( Fig . 3 ) . The protein predicted from the sequence of this cDNA is acidic and resembles certain DNA - binding proteins such as the transcription factor UBF1 and nucleolin ( data not shown ) . The cDNA clones corresponding to transcript A ( Fig . 3 ) were abundant in the library . Twelve cDNA clones were isolated in a screen of 30 000 plaques using pCes 902 as a probe . Six of these clones were approxi - mately 1 . 3 kb in size . The rest were smaller and , based on sequence analysis , represented truncations of the larger clones .

Plasmid pCes 902 ( Fig . 3 ) was 3zp - labelled and hybridized to Southern blots containing HindIII - digested genomic DNA from C . elegans ( Ce ) and C . bri99sae ( Cb ) . The results indicate that pCes 902 contains a single copy element also found in C . briggsae DNA . This element is the une - 60 gene ( see Results ) .

Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of uric - 60 . Sequence corresponding to cDNA is shown in upper case , intron and spacer DNA is lower case . The portion of the trans - spliced SL1 sequence attached to the cDNA clones is shown above the genomic sequence . The amino acid sequence derived from each transcript is shown above ( unc - 6OA ) or below ( une - 6OB ) the DNA sequence , The inverted repeat sequence in the second unc - 60B intron is under - lined , as is the putative hairpin in the fourth unc - 60B intron . The direct repeats in the fourth intron of unc - 60B are indicated by a double underline . The primers that failed to amplify DNA from s1586 homozygotes are indicated by arrows at positions 1317 and 2175 of the genomic sequence . A primer pair that was used to amplify DNA from s1586 homozygotes is indicated at positions 832 and 1341 of the genomic sequence . The unc - 60 gene sequence is available under the Genbank accession number L18963 ( Fig . 3 ) were less abundant in the library . Two cDNA clones were isolated in a screen of 50 000 plaques using the 3 . 5 kb SaII - BamHI fragment as a probe . Both clones were 700 bp in size . Probes which are specific for each transcript hybridize to a single band on Northern blots , and this band is the same size as the cDNA clones ( Fig . 5 ) . Identification of unc - 60 transcripts Sequencing of the cDNA clones showed that transcripts A and B are generated through alternative splicing ( Fig . 3 and 6 ) . The longest cDNA clones from transcript A and transcript B share a small 58 nucteotide exon at their 5 ' ends . These two transcripts are products of the unc - 60 gene , based on the following experiments , which showed that one unc - 60 mutation ( s1586 ; Fig . 3 ) is a small deletion disrupting only these two transcripts . Originally isolated by Johnsen and Baillie ( 1991 ) , sl586 fails to complement unc - 60 ( m35 ) and it is the only known unc - 60 mutation with a lethal phenotype ; the s1586 hom - ozygotes do not develop past the mid - larval stage . The other 10 alleles of unc - 60 form an allelic series with varying phenotypic severity , but worms homozygous for any of these alleles are viable ( McKim et al . 1988 ) . The deletion was detected in unc - 60 ( s1586 ) DNA by PCR analysis . Primer pairs from transcript A were used in PCR amplifications , using DNA from si586 homozy - gotes as the amplification template ( see Materials and methods ) . Evidence for the deletion was our inability to amplify by PCR the Y portion of transcript A in unc - 60 ( s1586 ) homozygotes . Primer pairs specific to the 5 ' portion of transcript A were used successfully to obtain amplification products . These results revealed a deletion in the 3 ' end of transcript A in unc - 60 ( s1586 ) mutants ( Fig . 3 ) which is outside of the translated portion of the gene . We determined that the deletion does not extend beyond the neighboring cosmid ( K06H5 , Fig . 2 ) since primers from this cosmid amplified DNA from s1586 homozygotes , In order to determine the extent of the sl586 deletion , genomic DNA from sl586 heterozygotes and a C . eleoans wild - type strain ( N2 ) was blotted and probed with the A B PROBE = unc - 60A PROBE = unc - 60B H P H P 0 . 7 ~ . 12 5 . 1 44 . 8 5 . 0 ~ 44 . 8 44 . 2 < 4 , 2 3 . 0 ~ 0 . 7 ~ Fig . 7A , B . Identification of a DNA alteration associated with the s1586 allele . Genomic DNA from wild - type ( N2 ) and s1586 heterozygotes was digested with HindIII ( H ) or PstI ( P ) , blotted , and hybridized with an unc - 60B cDNA probe ( B ) . The same filter was stripped and hybridized with an unc - 60A cDNA probe ( A ) . Probe preparation , hybridization , and hybridization detection were performed using the ECL Random Prime labelling and detection systems , using protocols and reagents supplied by the manufacturer ( Amersham ) . A unc - 60A hybridization showing the deletion of the HindIII site that separates unc - 60A from unc - 60B ( see Fig . 3 ) in genomic DNA prepared from s1586 heterozygotes . Molecular sizes are shown on the left in kb . B unc - 60B hybridization showing the same polymorphisms detected by the unc - 60A cDNA probe . For an interpretation of these hybridization patterns , see Results 352 cDNA clones for transcripts A and B . The two cDNA clones detected the same polymorphisms in genomic DNA digested with PstI , SalI , XbaI and HindIII . Exam - ples of the HindIII and PstI polymorphisms are shown in Fig . 7 . Since the cDNAs do not overlap , and because PCR analysis had revealed that the left breakpoint of the deletion is in the 3 ' UTR of transcript A , we conclude that the right breakpoint of the deletion must be within transcript B . The presence of a polymorphic 5 . 1 kb Hin - dIII fragment detected by the two cDNAs suggests that the deletion removes the HindIII site separating tran - script A from transcript B . Furthermore , the fact that the polymorphic PstI fragment is smaller than the wild - type fragment suggests that the rightmost deficiency break - point does not delete the PstI site immediately to the right of the deleted HindlII site ( Fig . 3 and 7 ) . Com - parisons of the sizes of the various polymorphic frag - ments to the wild - type band sizes reveals the s1586 muta - tion is a deletion of approximately 600 bp . In an attempt to show which transcript encodes the unc - 60 muscle - specific function , we injected unc - 60 ( m35 ) mutants with F53E2 restriction fragments . Plasmid pCes 902 , which contains all of transcript A and 2 kb of 5 ' sequence , did not rescue unc - 60 ( m35 ) homozygotes . These experiments were complicated by the fact that pCes 902 was poisonous to the worms ; no transformed worms could be isolated unless the concentration of pCes 902 was kept low ( 1 ng / gl ) . Since this fragment alone does not rescue unc - 60 ( m35 ) , it is possible that transcript B is required for unc - 60 ( + ) function . Alternatively , cor - rect expression of transcript A could require the presence of transcript B , or vice versa . It is also possible that both transcripts are required for unc - 60 function . We do not think the latter possibility is likely since unc - 60 mutants are isolated at a frequency consistent with an average size gene requiring a single mutation for an observable phenotype ( McKim et al . 1988 ) . We have not injected a fragment containing only transcript B since all of transcript A is contained within the first intron of tran - script B . The unc - 60 sequence Sequence data were generated from several of the cDNA clones and genomic subclones obtained from the cosmid F53E2 ( Fig . 6 ) . The 1 . 3 kb cDNA clones from transcript A and the two 700 bp cDNA clones from transcript B are probably full length for three reasons . Firstly , analysis of the genomic and cDNA sequence indicates the mRNAs are trans - spliced at their 5 ' ends to the SL - 1 trans - spliced leader sequence ( Krause and Hirsh 1987 ) . The first 6 basepairs of the cDNA sequence are not found in the genomic sequence ( Fig . 6 ) . This divergent sequence is identical to the 3 ' terminal nucteotides of the SL - 1 sequence . At the point where the genomic and cDNA sequences diverge , the genomic sequence has a 3 ' splice acceptor site ( CTTGCAG ; Fig . 6 ) . Secondly , both cDNA clones end with a poly ( A ) sequence at their 3 ' ends . Thirdly , cDNA probes which are specific for each transcript hybridize to mRNAs of a single size on North - ern blots , and these mRNAs are the sizes predicted from the sequence analysis ( Fig . 5 ) . We have also identified a putative initiator ATG codon in the first exon of each transcript contained within the context of a C . elegans consensus sequence for translation initiation ( M . D . Perry , G . L . Hertz and W . B . Wood , personal commun - ication ) . The open reading frame of transcript A is 495 nucleotides long , encoding a 165 amino acid protein . The remainder of transcript A comprises 719 nucleotides of 3 ' untranslated region ( Fig . 6 ) . The open reading frame of transcript B is 456 nucleotides long and encodes a 152 amino acid protein . Transcript B has 205 nucleotides of 3 ' untranslated sequence . From comparison of the unc - 60 cDNA and genomic sequences , we have deduced the splicing patterns shown in Fig . 3 . The only exon shared by the two transcripts is the first . Transcript A is composed of the first five exons . All four introns are in the coding portion of the tran - script and are 109 , 153 , 53 and 60 nucleotides in length ( Fig . 3 and 6 ) . Transcript B is composed of the first exon and the last four exons , and has relatively large introns , the first of which includes all of transcript A . The last three introns in transcript B are 370 , 499 and 1165 nu - cleotides in length . The majority of the donor and accep - tor site sequences are similar to the consensus sequence for C . elegans introns ( A / GAGGTAAGTT . . . . . TTTCAG - G / A ; Emmons 1988 ) . Two notable exceptions , which match the consensus sequence poorly , are the acceptor sites for the splice event between the first and second exons of each transcript ( TTCTAG and GTACAG ; Fig . 6 ) . Perhaps this is a point at which the alternative splicing of this transcription unit is controlled . The introns of transcript B contain repetitive elements Within the 370 nucleotide second intron of transcript B is a sequence with a high degree of identity to sequences found in the C . elegans sex determination gene fern - 1 ( Spence et al . 1990 ) , the putative myogenic regulatory gene hlh - 1 ( Krause et al . 1990 ) and two genes controlling cell death , ced - 3 and ced - 9 ( S . Shaham and R . Horvitz , personal communication ) ( Fig . 6 ) . As Spence et al . ( 1990 ) observed , this sequence is an inverted repeat and could form a stem - loop structure . The first 20 nucleotides at the 5 ' end of the conserved sequence , however , are not part of the inverted repeat . At the beginning of the next intron , the sequence TAAGCCT is repeated six times , and the sequence GAG ( A / C ) ( A / C ) T is repeated four times . The fourth intron of transcript B contains a sequence that could form a stem - loop structure , begin - ning 60 nucleotides into the intron . In addition , the fourth intron contains direct repeats commencing 430 nucleotides into the intron , and extending for 675 nucleo - tides . These repeats are oriented head to tail with no spacer DNA between the repeat units . The repeat units are of two types ; either long ( 21 nucleotides ) or short ( 15 nucleotides ) . The consensus sequence for the repeating unit is ( A / G ) AAAACTCGGCCATC { AACTAG } , where the nucleotides in brackets are absent in the short form of the repeat .

Comparison of the Unc - 60 proteins to actin depolymerizing factors . The BLAST algorithm was used to search a number of databanks for similarities to either Unc - 60A or Unc - 60B ( see Mate - rials and methods ) . Significant similarities to actin - depolymerizing factors ( ADFs ) were discovered . The Unc - 60A and Unc - 60B pro - teins are indicated . Comparisons are to Lilium long ( torurn ( lily ; S . Kim , Y . Kim , G . An , personal communication ) , actophorin from Acanthamoeba castellanii ( protozoan ; S . Quirk , S . K . Maciver , J . VanDamme , personal communication ) , human cofilin ( human ; Ogawa et al . 1990 ) and chick cofilin isolated from skeletal muscle ( chick ; Abe et al . 1990 ) . Other known members of this family not shown in this Figure include Saccharomyces cerevisiae COF1 ( Moon et al . 1993 ) and ABP1 ( Drubin et al . 1990 ) , chick brain destrin ( Adams et al . 1990 ) , destrin from chick skeletal muscle ( Abe et al . 1990 ) , porcine brain cofilin ( Matsuzaki et al . 1988 ) , porcine brain destrin ( Moriyama et al . 1990b ) , and mouse cofilin ( Moriya - ma et al . 1990a ) . ADF residues identical to residues in either the Unc - 60A or Unc - 60B proteins are in bold capitals . Conservative replacements are indicated by plain capitals . Non - conservative re - placements are indicated by lightface lower case lettering . Gaps have been introduced to maximize the similarity to either the Unc - 60A or Unc - 60B proteins database revealed that sequences in the first third of this intron have high degrees of nucleotide identity to other C . elegans sequences , including sequences reported from two cDNAs . Given the repetitive hybridization patterns seen with the Southern blot results described above , the presence of repetitive DNA in our genomic sequence was not surprising . Furthermore , based on the repetitive cross - species hybridization results , these sequences could be conserved in C . bri99sae . The function , if any , of these non - coding sequences is not known . The unc - 60 9ene encodes two putative actin - bindin 9 proteins Transcripts A and B share only one exon , but their respective proteins ( designated Unc - 60A and Unc - 60B ) are homologous . There is 38 % identity between the 152 amino acids of Unc - 60B and the Unc - 60A protein ( Fig . 8 ) . It is possible that the two transcripts originated from a duplication of the final four exons of one of the transcripts . Allowing for some drift ( a small number of nucleotides ) in the location of introns , three of the in - trons are in the same location in both transcripts A and B . In addition , each transcript has an intron in a unique location . This could be accounted for if the original gene had five introns and one was subsequently lost from each transcript after the duplication event . Both transcripts encode proteins that are homologous to the cofilin and destrin family of actin - binding proteins first identified in vertebrate systems ( Fig . 8 ) . More recent - ly , cofilin or destrin homologs have been identified in plants ( Brassica napa and Lilium longiflorum ) and the amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii . There is also weak homology to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae actin binding protein ABP1 ( data not shown ; Drubin et al . 1990 ) . In vertebrates , the difference between the cofilin and destrin proteins was first defined by their in vitro biochemical activities ( see Discussion ) , but they can also be distin - guished by amino acid sequence ( see references in Fig . 8 ) . The plant proteins and amoeba sequences are known only as actin depolymerizing factors . The degree of iden - tity between the C . elegans Unc - 60A amino acid sequence and the cofilins is 28 % , and between Unc - 60A and the plant sequences is 40 % . Identity between the Unc - 60B amino acid sequence and the plant and amoeba se - quences is approximately 32 % . Discussion The unc - 60 gene is essential for the correct positioning of the thin filaments in C . elegans body wall muscle ( Water - ston et al . 1980 ) . In Unc - 60 mutants , most of the actin - containing thin filaments aggregate at the ends of the body wall muscle cell . The myosin - containing thick fila - 354 ments are left relatively intact . In this paper , we report the cloning and sequencing of the unc - 60 gene and , con - sistent with the mutant phenotype , we show the predicted protein is homologous to a family of actin binding pro - teins found in plants and animals . We have shown by germline transformation rescue experiments that the cosmid F53E2 carries the unc - 60 gene . Molecular analysis of the unc - 60 allele s1586 has defined the coding region corresponding to the unc - 60 locus , s1586 is a small deletion involving a single gene . This gene produces at least two transcripts , which we have named unc - 60A and unc - 6OB . Although the two transcripts share only a single exon encoding the initiator methionine , they encode homologous proteins . While we do not know which transcript is required for muscle function , it is probably not unc - 60A for two reasons . Firstly , clones containing unc - 60A did not rescue the Unc - 60 phenotype in transformation experiments . Secondly , sequencing of four unc - 60 mutant alleles has failed to detect changes in unc - 60A ( K . McKim and C . Matheson , unpublished results ) . Therefore the second protein , encoded by unc - 6OB , may be required for the muscle function of this locus . A putative actin - depolymerizing factor is required for the development of thin filaments in C . elegans muscle Analysis of the DNA sequence indicates that both pro - teins encoded by the unc - 60 locus are C . elegans hom - ologs of the cofilin and destrin family ( also known as Actin Depolymerizing Factor ) of actin - binding proteins ( Fig . 8 ) . This is a phylogenetically diverse family of proteins , with members identified in animals , plants and protozoans . These proteins have been most extensively studied in vertebrates , where it has been shown that cofilin and destrin bind to actin filaments and monomers and depolymerize actin filaments . The activity of cofilin is pH dependent . At high pH , cofilin depolymerizes actin filaments , but at low pH , it promotes polymerization ( Yonezawa et al . 1985 ) . In addition , cofilin is associated with the actin rods induced by treatment of cultured cells with heat shock or dimethylsulphoxide ( Nishida et al . 1987 ) . In contrast , destrin depolymerizes actin filaments independently of pH . The level of amino acid sequence identity within this group of proteins ranges from 28 % to 40 % . For example , the C . elegans Unc - 60A sequence is about 28 % identical to the vertebrate cofilin proteins and 40 % identical to the plant actin depolymerizing factors . This low level of sequence identity is also seen between other members of this family ; sequence comparisons between plant and amoeba or vertebrate show 35 - 45 % identity . Several lines of evidence suggest that , despite the ex - tensive sequence divergence , these proteins are hom - ologs . First , many of the amino acid differences between the proteins involve conservative changes ( Fig . 8 ) . Second , the amino acid identities are not scattered throughout the proteins , but are concentrated at four islands of homology . With respect to the Unc - 60A sequence , conserved domains can be found commencing at amino acid positions 1 ( MSSGVMVDP ) , 27 ( YIIF - KID ) , 80 ( CRYAVFDF ) and 117 ( KKKMVYASS ) . The last of these domains has been shown to be the actin - binding site of the vertebrate cofilin sequence . The two lysine residues of the human sequence have been shown to cross - link to actin ( Yonezawa et al . 1991a , b ) . Within each phylogenetic group , sequence identity is high . For example , there is greater than 80 % amino acid identity within the vertebrate cofilin or destrin groups , greater than 70 % identity between destrin and cofilin ( see references in Fig . 8 ) , and the two plant proteins are 77 % identical . In contrast to the high degree of similarity between the sequences within the plant or vertebrate groups , the two unc - 60 proteins have only 38 % sequence identity . This finding suggests that the Unc - 60 protein sequences have diverged to accommodate different func - tions . In addition to the sequence , three structural patterns of the vertebrate transcripts and unc - 60A are also con - served , further supporting the hypothesis that we have identified the nematode homologs of cofilin or destrin . First , the proteins are small , in the range of 138 to 166 amino acids long . All destrins and Unc - 60A contain 165 amino acids , while all cofilins contain 166 amino acids . Second , the four conserved domains have the same rela - tive location in each protein ( Fig . 8 ) . Third , the tran - scripts of all the vertebrate cofilin and destrin genes and unc - 60A have 3 ' untranslated regions which , at ap - proximately 700 nucleotides in length , are longer than the coding regions ( see Fig . 8 for references ) . The large untranslated region could be involved in the regulation of translation , as described for the fern - 3 ( Ahringer and Kimble 1991 ) and tra - 2 genes of C . elegans ( Kuwabara et al . 1992 ) . Alternatively , the large 3 ' UTR could be involved in the cellular localization of the transcript , as with beta actin ( Sundell and Singer 1991 ) and bicoid mRNAs ( MacDonald and Struhl 1988 ) . As noted above , the differences between unc - 60A and unc - 60B suggest that each protein has evolved for a unique function . These differences include the following . First , Unc - 60B retains the conserved sequence motifs found in Unc - 60A , but with some interesting differences . The YASS sequence of the actin - binding domain is con - served in both C . elegans proteins , but the upstream ly - sines are found only in cofilin and Unc - 60A . Further - more , the sequence CRYA is conserved in all the pro - teins , but the aspartic acid residue immediately upstream is present in Unc - 60A , vertebrate and amoeba proteins , but absent in Unc - 60B . The changes , however , are usu - ally conservative . For example , the three lysines in Unc - 60A are replaced by three arginines in Unc - 60B . Second , unc - 60B has a shorter open reading frame and 3 ' untrans - lated region than unc - 6OA . Finally , unc - 60B is expressed at a lower level than unc - 60A as judged from Northern analysis and the representation of cDNA clones in the library we screened . Correlating with the lower level of expression is the larger size of the unc - 60B introns , unc - 60A contains characteristically small introns for C . ele - gans , in the range of 53 to 153 nucleotides , unc - 6OB , on the other hand , has introns characteristic of the largest in C . elegans , ranging in size from 370 to 1165 nucleo - 355 tides . This does not include the largest intron , the 1680 nucleotide first intron which contains most of the unc - 60A transcript . The significance of the correlation be - tween increased expression and small introns is not known . The vertebrate cofilins and destrins have been isolated from non - muscle cells and from skeletal muscle ( Abe et al . 1989 , 1990 ) . Perhaps the more divergent Unc - 60B protein has evolved for a specialized function in nema - tode muscle cells ( see below ) . This is not the case in the chick ; identical proteins were isolated from brain and skeletal muscle ( Abe et al . 1990 ; Adams et al . 1990 ) . It is also probable that Unc - 60 is not the only C . elegans actin - binding protein involved in actin filament poly - merization . As many as thirteen different actin - binding proteins have been identified ( Vandekerckhove and Van - compernalle 1992 ) . Candidates for additional nematode actin - binding proteins are the uncharactized products of the unc - 78 and unc - 94 genes , as mutations in these genes disrupt I - band organization ( Waterston et al . 1980 ; Zen - gel and Epstein 1980 ) . Another potential nematode actin - binding protein is the product of sup - 12 , mutations in which act as recessive suppressors of unc - 60 mutations ( R . Francis and R . Waterston , personal communication ; McKim et al . 1988 ) . There is little sequence identity between the different families , but most bind to the ami - no terminus of the actin peptide . The formation of func - tional C . elegans thin filaments probably results from the combined activities of several actin - binding proteins . A model for unc - 6Ofunction The observation that unc - 60 encodes a cofilin or destrin - like actin - binding protein is entirely consistent with the phenotype of une - 60 mutants . Since thin filaments form in Unc - 60 mutant muscle , the unc - 60 protein is not re - quired for polymerization . More probably , the improper aggregation of thin filaments in the muscle cells of unc - 60 mutants ( Waterston et al . 1980 ) can be explained if the unc - 60 gene product is required to regulate the poly - merization of actin . We propose that if the rate of actin polymerization is not controlled by a depolymerizing factor , the thin filaments will improperly aggregate . It is also possible that Unc - 60 does not depolymerize actin filaments , but binds and sequesters monomeric actin , thereby eliminating it from the actin pool available for polymerization . This model is supported by the observation that the phenotype characteristic of unc - 60 mutants , the aggrega - tion of thin filaments at the ends of the body wall muscle cells , is observed in another mutant defective in actin polymerization . Dominant antimorphic mutations in the act - 1 or act - 3 C . elegans actin genes have this phenotype ( Landel et al . 1984 ; Waterston et al . 1984 ) . In this case , the mutant peptides probably interfere with the poly - merization of peptides derived from the other three actin - encoding loci . Thus , there is precedence for the aggrega - tion of thin filaments at the ends of the body wall muscle cells being caused by abnormal actin polymerization . Furthermore , Shimizu and Obinata ( 1986 ) proposed that actin polymerization in developing skeletal muscle is controlled or suppressed by regulatory proteins . Thus , in Unc - 60 muscle cells , the absence of depolymerizing activ - ity from the unc - 60 locus could result in unregulated actin polymerization , which could then result in the improper aggregation of thin filaments . That Unc - 60 might regu - late actin polymerization through a depolymerizing ac - tivity is similar to the proposal for the function of the Unc - 60 homolog actophorin in Acanthamoeba castellani . Maciver et al . ( 1991a , b ) showed that actophorin depoly - merizing activity is required in conjunction with alpha - actinin to stimulate bundling of actin filaments in vitro . Without the depolymerizing activity of actophorin , the actin filaments grow to an abnormally long length and are not bundled by alpha - actinin . In addition to the muscle - specific activity , the unc - 60 locus encodes an essential function required for the via - bility of the organism . Individuals homozygous for unc - 60 ( s1586 ) are arrested in development at a mid - larval stage . This phenotype is distinct from the Pat phenotype described for other mutations affecting muscle , including alleles of unc - 52 ( Gilchrist and Moerman 1992 ) , deb - 1 ( Barstead and Waterston 1991 ) , unc - 45 ( Venolia and Waterston 1990 ) and myo - 3 ( Waterston 1989 ) . The Pat phenotype is characterized by a failure of the animal to elongate past the two - fold stage , and arrest at the L1 larval stage ( B . Williams , personal communication ) . Our molecular analysis of the lethal unc - 60 allele , s1586 , shows that the essential function of this locus could be provided by either one or both of the unc - 60 transcripts , since s1586 deletes portions of unc - 60A and unc - 6OB . Uric - 60 is not the only cofilin homolog demonstrated to have an essential in vivo function . An essential in vivo role for the Saccharornyces cerevisiae homolog of mam - malian cofilin has been reported ; complete disruptions of the COF1 gene in yeast result in lethality ( Moon et al . 1993 ) . As cofilin homologs from two systems have been shown to encode essential functions , it is likely that other actin - binding proteins could also be identified by lethal mutation in these systems . Unc - 60 is the first example of a member of the cofilin / destrin family of actin - depoly - merizing proteins described in a metazoan amenable to classical genetic analysis . Utilizing mutational analysis , possible with the powerful genetics of the C . elegans system , further studies of the uric - 60 gene products will be valuable in elucidating the role of cofilin and destrin in actin filament assembly .
