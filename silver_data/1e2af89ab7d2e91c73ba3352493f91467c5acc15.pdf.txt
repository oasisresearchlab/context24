Several substrates of Abl - family kinase have been identiﬁed , but they are unlikely to mediate all of the downstream actions of these kinases on cytoskeletal structure . We used a human protein microarray to identify the actin - regu - latory protein cortactin as a novel substrate of the Abl and Abl - related gene ( Arg ) nonreceptor tyrosine ki - nases . Cortactin stimulates cell motility [ 4 – 6 ] , and its upregulation in several cancers correlates with poor prognosis [ 7 ] . Even though cortactin can be tyrosine phosphorylated by Src - family kinases in vitro [ 8 ] , we show that Abl and Arg are more adept at binding and phosphorylating cortactin . Importantly , we demon - strate that platelet - derived growth - factor ( PDGF ) - induced cortactin phosphorylation on three tyrosine residues requires Abl or Arg . Cortactin triggers F - actin - dependent dorsal waves in ﬁbroblasts after PDGF treatment and thus results in actin reorganiza - tion and lamellipodial protrusion [ 9 ] . We provide evidence that Abl / Arg - mediated phosphorylation of cortactin is required for this PDGF - induced dorsal - wave response . Our results reveal that Abl - family kinases target cortactin as an effector of cytoskeletal rearrangements in response to PDGF . Results and Discussion Adhesion and growth - factor receptors act through Abl - family tyrosine kinases to regulate cell morphogenesis and migration . Genetic studies demonstrate that Abl - family kinases are essential for epithelial - cell morpho - genesis [ 10 , 11 ] , cell migration and chemotaxis [ 12 – 14 ] , axon pathﬁnding [ 15 ] , and dendrite maintenance [ 16 ] . Abl - family - kinase signaling pathways also become disrupted in cancer cells [ 17 ] . The Bcr - Abl oncoprotein , resulting from a reciprocal chromosomal translocation involving the bcr and abl genes , causes chronic myelogenous and acute lymphocytic leukemia in hu - mans [ 18 ] . Cells transformed with Bcr - Abl exhibit altered migratory [ 19 ] and adhesive behavior [ 20 ] and exhibit reduced responsiveness to chemotactic cues [ 21 ] . We used a human protein microarray to search for novel Abl / Arg substrates . The microarray contained 2400 different human proteins spotted in duplicate ( the accession numbers of the microarrayed proteins are listed in Table S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online ) . The array also contained control proteins—protein kinases A and C and the Abl / Arg sub - strate Crk [ 22 ] —spotted at regular intervals . Incubating the array with g - 33 P - ATP alone led to autophosphoryla - tion of protein kinases A and C , generating landmark sig - nals for subsequent alignment and analysis of the array . Incubating the array with g - 33 P - ATP + Arg labeled Crk as well as other novel substrates ( Figure 1A ) . These Arg - dependent phosphorylation events were inhibited by the Abl / Arg kinase inhibitor STI - 571 [ 23 ] and were eliminated by treatment of the array with a tyrosine phosphatase ( Figure S1 and data not shown ) , indicating that these signals arose from Arg - mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the proteins . We focused on one newly identiﬁed putative substrate , cortactin , because it is a known regulator of cytoskeletal rearrangements and was a kinetically favorable Abl and Arg substrate in solution - based assays ( see below ) . Because Abl and Arg are related in sequence and function , we tested whether both kinases could bind cortactin . A protein microarray containing Abl , Arg , and bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) was probed with a glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) - cortactin fusion protein and detection with GST antibodies followed . In a pilot experiment , cortactin bound to both Abl and Arg but not to BSA ( Figure S1B ) . This interaction was also de - tected when cortactin was spotted onto microarrays and probed with Abl or Arg ( Figure S1B ) . No signal was detected upon probing with the unrelated Chk1 and c - Kit kinases ( Figure S1B ) . To determine whether other protein kinases interact with cortactin , we pre - pared a protein microarray containing 96 human protein kinases and probed it with puriﬁed cortactin . The stron - gest signals for cortactin interactions were observed with Abl , Arg , and the serine - threonine kinase Pak3 ( Figure 1B ) . The Pak3 - homolog Pak1 has been shown to bind to cortactin in vitro [ 24 ] . Notably , cortactin prob - ing of Src - family kinases ( FynT , Lck , Src , Yes , Hck , and LynA ) yielded weaker signals than Abl , Arg , and Pak3 . In vitro protein - kinase assays demonstrated that Abl and Arg phosphorylate cortactin in solution with K M ( Mi - chaelis constant ) values ( Abl K M = 23 nM , Arg K M = 80 nM ) that are lesser than those of previously reported physiological Abl / Arg substrates ( Arg K M for p190Rho - GAP = 120 nM , Abl / Arg K M for Crk = 500 nM ) ( Figure 1C ) [ 25 , 26 ] . Treatment with PDGF is known for inducing Abl and Arg kinase activities [ 27 , 28 ] and increasing tyrosine phosphorylation on cortactin [ 29 ] in ﬁbroblasts . PDGF treatment stimulates cortactin phosphorylation 5 - fold * Correspondence : anthony . koleske @ yale . edu in wild - type mouse 3T3 ﬁbroblasts ( WT cells ) ( Figures 2A and 2B ) . PDGF - induced cortactin phosphorylation was signiﬁcantly reduced in arg – / – cells and nearly absent in abl – / – cells , whereas the loss of both kinases in abl – / – arg – / – cells completely eliminates cortactin phos - phorylation ( Figures 2A and 2B ) . Re - expression of Abl - YFP in abl – / – cells or Arg - YFP in arg – / – cells rescues PDGF - dependent cortactin phosphorylation ( Figures S2A and S2B ) . Cortactin phosphorylation is increased in cells with elevated Src activity [ 30 ] , and PDGF - induced cortactin phosphorylation is reduced by inhibiting Src [ 31 ] , sug - gesting that cortactin is phosphorylated by Src or other kinases downstream of Src . Indeed , coexpression of Src with cortactin in HEK293 cells led to increased cortactin phosphorylation ( Figure S3A ) . Src phosphorylates cor - tactin directly in vitro , albeit with a K M value ( 320 nM ) that is 14 - and 4 - fold greater than those for Abl and Figure 1 .

Increasing concentrations of puriﬁed full - length recombinant His 6 - cortactin were incubated with Abl , Arg , or Src in the presence of g - 32 P - ATP . Phosphorimage of representative kinase reactions is shown on the left . Concentration dependence of cortactin phosphorylation is shown on the right . K M values for each kinase are indicated . Current Biology 446 Arg , respectively ( Figure 1C ) . PDGF - dependent cortac - tin phosphorylation was abrogated in src – / – yes – / – fyn – / – ( SYF ) cells ( Figure 2A ) . Re - expression of Src in SYF cells ( SYF + Src cells ) leads to constitutive cortactin phos - phorylation , which is not further increased upon PDGF treatment ( Figures S2A and S2B ) . This constitutive phosphorylation may result from the high levels of Src expression in SYF + Src cells ( R 10 - fold greater than normal endogenous levels ) . The kinase activities of Src - and Abl - family kinases are both activated by PDGF treatment , and PDGF - dependent activation of Abl and Arg kinase activities re - quires Src [ 27 , 28 ] . There are therefore three possibilities that explain how Src - and Abl - family kinases interact to achieve cortactin phosphorylation : ( 1 ) Src phosphory - lates cortactin directly , ( 2 ) Src , Abl , and Arg each inde - pendently phosphorylate cortactin , or ( 3 ) Src activates Abl / Arg to phosphorylate cortactin . The ﬁnding that PDGF - stimulated cortactin phosphorylation is absent in abl – / – arg – / – cells ( Figure 2A , lanes 13 – 16 ) eliminates possibility 1 . Moreover , the ﬁnding ( in Figure 2 ) that Src - family kinases and Abl - family kinases are both required for cortactin phosphorylation eliminates possibility 2 . Together with previous work [ 27 , 28 ] , our data is most consistent with Src acting as an intermedi - ary that activates Abl and Arg to phosphorylate cortactin after PDGF stimulation . Thus , although Src can phos - phorylate cortactin in vitro ( Figure 1C ) , the cumulative data suggest that it plays an indirect role in PDGF - induced cortactin phosphorylation . Cortactin can be phosphorylated on tyrosines 421 , 466 , and 482 in vitro [ 4 ] . Mutation of each tyrosine indi - vidually reduced phosphotyrosine content relative to WT cortactin ( Figure S3B ) . Mutation of Y421 , Y466 , and Y482 to phenylalanine ( cortactin - 3F ) completely ab - rogated cortactin phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo upon coexpression with Abl or Arg ( Figures S3B and S3C ) . These observations indicate that cortactin resi - dues Y421 , Y466 , and Y482 are required for its phos - phorylation by Abl or Arg in vitro and in vivo . PDGF stimulation causes cortactin to translocate from a perinuclear region to colocalize with dynamin in F - actin - rich circular dorsal waves [ 9 ] ( Figure 3A ) . These dorsal waves reorganize the actin structure and disas - semble F - actin stress ﬁbers to allow for subsequent lamellipodial protrusion [ 9 ] . Abl and Arg are required Figure 2 .

PDGF Induces Abl / Arg to Phosphorylate Cortactin 447 for dorsal - wave formation [ 27 ] , but their biochemical roles in this process are unclear . Dorsal waves were not observed and cortactin remained localized around the nucleus after PDGF stimulation of SYF and abl – / – arg – / – cells or STI - 571 - treated WT cells ( Figure 3A and Figure S4A ) . Expression of cortactin - RFP at 1 . 5 - fold endogenous levels ( Figure 3B ) in WT cells led to an increased proportion of cells that exhibit dorsal waves ( Figure 3C ) . When expressed at a similar level , the cortactin - 3F - RFP mutant did not promote increased dorsal - wave formation in WT cells . Likewise , cortactin - RFP does not increase dorsal - wave frequency in abl – / – arg – / – or SYF cells . These data indicate that the ability of cortactin to stimulate dorsal - wave formation requires phosphorylation of Y421 , Y466 , and Y482 . We generated cortactin knockdown cells to examine the requirement for cortactin phosphorylation in dor - sal - wave formation . Cortactin knockdown ( KD ) cells Figure 3 .

Current Biology 448 that express cortactin at only approximately 6 % of nor - mal endogenous levels exhibit 56 % fewer dorsal waves after PDGF treatment ( Figures 4A , 4C , and 4D ) . Re - expression of RNAi - resistant cortactin - RFP in cortactin KD cells rescues dorsal - wave formation ( Figures 4B – 4D ) . However , RNAi - resistant cortactin - 3F - RFP does not rescue the deﬁcit in dorsal - wave formation ( Figures 4B – 4D ) . Thus , phosphorylation of cortactin is necessary for efﬁcient dorsal - wave formation . Importantly , we did not observe dorsal waves in the cortactin KD cells re - expressing cortactin - 3F - RFP over a 40 min period ( Figure S5 ) , indicating that cortactin - 3F - RFP does not promote dorsal - wave formation with delayed kinetics . Dorsal waves are enriched in cytoskeletal regulators ( e . g . , Arp2 / 3 complex , N - WASp , WAVE1 , and gelsolin ) and adhesion complex proteins ( paxillin and vinculin ) that may interact with cortactin in a phosphorylation - dependent manner [ 9 ] . Our studies identify cortactin as an Abl / Arg substrate and demonstrate that Abl / Arg - mediated cortactin phosphorylation is required for dor - sal - wave formation after PDGF treatment . Loss of an - other Abl - family - kinase substrate , p190RhoGAP , does not affect dorsal - wave formation ( Figure S6 ) . Thus , cor - tactin represents a critical target of Abl - family kinases in PDGF - induced dorsal - wave formation . We used human protein microarrays to identify sub - strates of the Abl and Arg kinases . Because kinases are dysregulated in cancer and other human diseases , this approach has the potential to identify critical down - stream effectors of these disease processes . For Figure 4 .

PDGF Induces Abl / Arg to Phosphorylate Cortactin 449 example , cells transformed with the constitutively active Bcr - Abl kinase are hypermotile [ 32 ] and have reduced chemotactic responses [ 21 ] . Our ﬁndings raise the in - triguing possibility that these phenotypes result from the altered function of cortactin or its hematopoietic - speciﬁc ortholog HS1 [ 33 ] in these cells . Future studies will establish how Abl / Arg - dependent regulation of cortactin regulates cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell migration during development and whether these pathways become compromised in v - Abl or Bcr - Abl - positive leukemias .
