brief communications nature methods | VOL . 10 NO . 2 | FEBRUARY 2013 | 119 allows for mRNA detection 11 . We describe here the first example , to our knowledge , of single - mRNA counting of endogenously expressed yeast mRNAs using MS2 and PP7 in living cells , and we demonstrate that tagging does not perturb endogenous expression levels of MDN1 , an essential yeast gene ( Supplementary Results ) . Importantly , MS2 and PP7 systems can be used simultaneously for two - color imaging : in this case , to quantify expression of two MDN1 alleles over time . We further demonstrate the utility of the methodology using an intramolecular dual tagging that enables direct observation of RNA polymerase II ( pol II ) kinetics . The advances represented by this work bridge the gap between FISH and in vivo RNA imaging methodologies and provide the basis for future applications . MDN1 is the longest yeast gene ( 14 . 7 kb ) and encodes an essen - tial ATPase involved in ribosome assembly 12 . It is constitutively expressed at low steady - state numbers and remains transcription - ally active in nearly all cells 6 . We generated MDN1 - tagged stains by genomic integration of a cassette containing 24 copies of either PP7 or MS2 hairpins into the 3 ′ UTR ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) and screened for site - specific integration by PCR ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . To visualize MDN1 mRNAs , we transformed into each strain plasmids that encode the appropriate fluorescent coat protein ( MCP for MS2 strains and PCP for PP7 strains ) . We imaged fluo - rescent spots representing MDN1 mRNAs ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) using z - sweep acquisition ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) and quantified expression levels over time . Notably , neither tag appeared to perturb MDN1 expression levels ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . We confirmed that PP7 and MS2 interactions retain binding specificity when combined in vivo ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . We then generated two - color yeast strains by mating MDN1 - 24PP7 and MDN1 - 24MS2 haploids ( Fig . 1a ) and expressed PCP - 2yEGFP and MCP - mCherry such that transcription of each individually tagged MDN1 allele resulted in differentially labeled populations of mRNAs ( Fig . 1b – d ) . Examination of the expression of two alle - les provides an experimental system for exploring the stochastic nature of gene expression as cells progress through the cell cycle . Both alleles are subject to the same regulation , transcribed within the same nucleus and exposed to the same environmental vari - ables ; therefore , any variability in transcript number provides a measurement of intrinsic noise . Although single - molecule FISH has been used to correlate the expression of two alleles 13 , it has so far been impossible to investigate this in vivo over time . We used the change in steady - state levels between time points to calculate transcript fluctuations for each allele . Because the half - life of MDN1 mRNAs is 26 min ( ref . 14 ) , we imaged cells at 20 - min intervals until they entered mito - sis , which we determined using cell and nuclear morphology ( Supplementary Figs . 7 and 8 and Supplementary Videos 1 – 4 ) . single - molecule analysis of gene expression using two - color rna labeling in live yeast Sami Hocine 1 , Pascal Raymond 2 , Daniel Zenklusen 2 , Jeffrey A Chao 1 & Robert H Singer 1 Live - cell imaging of mrna yields important insights into gene expression , but it has generally been limited to the labeling of one rna species and has never been used to count single mrnas over time in yeast . We demonstrate a two - color imaging system with single - molecule resolution using ms2 and PP7 rna labeling . We use this methodology to measure intrinsic noise in mrna levels and rna polymerase ii kinetics at a single gene . The complex lifecycle of mRNAs requires regulation at every step 1 – 3 , and a growing body of evidence suggests that these steps are interconnected 4 . A comprehensive view of such complex regulatory systems depends on our ability to interrogate gene expression at the most fundamental level : single molecules . Our basic understanding of gene expression has come from ensemble biochemical approaches including northern blotting , reverse - transcriptase PCR , microarrays and high - throughput sequencing 5 . These approaches provide a measurement of the average mRNA abundance in a population but fail to illuminate certain aspects of gene expression , such as cell - to - cell variation in expression levels or the behaviors of single particles . The advantage of single - molecule FISH lies in the ability to detect single transcripts and distinguish multiple mRNA species using differentially labeled probe sets . This technique has been used to study the stochastic nature of transcription that produces variation within a clonal population 6 , 7 . However , FISH methods fail to provide the tem - poral resolution needed to accurately study dynamic cellular processes , a major limitation that must be overcome by live - cell imaging . The MS2 system , based on the high - affinity interac - tion between the MS2 bacteriophage coat protein and its cognate RNA hairpin , has been used for fluorescent labeling of mRNA to address a diversity of biological questions in many different model organisms 8 . More recently , a similar interaction from the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PP7 bacteriophage has been character - ized 9 and used to analyze transcriptional activity 10 . In both cases , RNA hairpin sequences are inserted in tandem into a gene of interest to tag it , and coexpression of a fluorescent coat protein 1 Department of Anatomy and Structural Biology , Albert Einstein College of Medicine , Bronx , New York , USA . 2 Department of Biochemistry , Université de Montréal , Montreal , Canada .

A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . 120 | VOL . 10 NO . 2 | FEBRUARY 2013 | nature methods brief communications The majority of time points analyzed ( 77 % ) revealed changes in steady - state levels over time that ranged from −3 to + 3 mRNAs , consistent with previous characterizations of MDN1 ( ref . 6 ) . Notably , expression of each allele appeared to be largely independ - ent over time ( Fig . 1e ) , with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0 . 1498 . In vivo results support the notion that transcript number , even for identical alleles , is stochastic and intrinsically noisy 13 , and they demonstrate the utility of this approach for studying the coordination of gene expression with single - molecule resolu - tion in living cells . This approach also provides insights into the different expression profiles that cells can maintain over time ( Supplementary Fig . 9 and Supplementary Results ) . Although the λ N system ( based on the interaction between protein N of the bacteriophage lambda and boxB RNA ) has been used in parallel with MS2 to study the transport of two yeast mRNAs 15 , the inability to resolve single molecules precluded the types of analyses described here . Overall , the ability to count mRNAs in vivo provides a quantitative tool for measuring many aspects of mRNA metabolism over time . For example , assess - ment of the role of randomness in cellular processes is important for understanding how cells maintain homeostasis . Previously described in vivo two - color systems have been used to study noise in gene expression 16 , 17 , but at the level of proteins , representing the combined contributions of transcription and translation . We show that mRNAs transcribed from different alleles of the same gene exhibited uncorrelated fluctuations in expression over time . One possible explanation for this is described by the transcription factor binding model 10 , in which the assembly of the pre - initiation complex cannot be predicted because it depends on the binding of a diffusible factor present at low abundance . Hence , despite the fact that both alleles are indistinguishable in their environment and regulatory mechanism , their transcription initiation is no more correlated than any other two genes . This two - color approach can be extended to further study the coordination of many gene expression regulatory networks . Engineering both tags in different regions of the same gene allows other aspects of gene expression to be investigated , such as polymerase dynamics at single genes or conformational changes within mRNA molecules as they are transported . To demonstrate this , we engineered a two - color intramolecular system to investi - gate pol II dynamics by inserting 24PP7 into the 5 ′ UTR of MDN1 and 24MS2 into the 3 ′ UTR ( Fig . 2a ) . Dual tagging of MDN1 was confirmed by FISH ( Supplementary Fig . 10 ) , and this gene was placed under the control of a GAL promoter so that expression was inducible and the generation of 5 ′ and 3 ′ signals could be followed over time . Upon induction , pol II complexes initiate transcription , and the time measured between the appearance of 5 ′ signal and 3 ′ signal provides a direct measurement of pol II elongation rates .

We induced MDN1 transcription by shifting to galactose - containing medium and imaged with low laser intensity every 2 min . An average elongation rate of 25 ± 2 bases per s , determined by the time it took for polymerases to transverse the 14 . 7 - kb gene , was consistent with other measurements derived from modeling of one - color data 10 . Most surprisingly , we observed a high degree of cell - to - cell variability ( Fig . 2b , c and Supplementary Videos 5 – 8 ) in elongation rates , ranging from 14 bases per s to 61 bases per s ( Fig . 2d ) , and these cell - to - cell differences were not dependent on cell - cycle stage . These findings suggest that elongation may not be as processive as previously believed . Differences in transcription factor abun - dance , alternate chromatin states and other variables likely under - lie such cell - to - cell variation , and further studies will be required to uncover the mechanistic details behind this observation . This intramolecular assay will be useful in answering additional questions regarding transcription , such as the extent to which downstream processes can feed back to influence transcription 4 . Furthermore , similar intramolecular assays using these reagents will provide insights into other stages of an mRNA’s life cycle . For example , mRNA - containing granules are believed to function in transport and translation in neurons 19 , and FISH experiments in neurons suggest that differential trafficking occurs depending on the mRNA species 20 . These tools allow for identification of the mRNA constituents of neuronal granules and measurement of differences in trafficking kinetics for different mRNA spe - cies , all within the same cell . We have used yeast to demonstrate the validity of this approach , but we emphasize that it will find applications in all model systems . methods Methods and any associated references are available in the online version of the paper .

W303 yeast cells were first transformed with pSH47 to allow induction of the CRE recombinase . Diploids were tagged as described previously 11 . Plasmids containing 24× hair - pins were generated from multimerizing 2xPP7V3 ( PP7SL on Addgene ) or 2xMS2ORF ( MS2SL - stable on Addgene ) sequences ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Primers with homology to the MDN1 3 ′ UTR were used to amplify an integration cassette containing 24 PP7V3 or MS2ORF hairpins ( pDZ416 and pDZ415 ) and the KAN R marker flanked by loxP sites ( Supplementary Table 2a ) . Cells were transformed by homologous recombination using 1 µ g PCR product , and positive integrants were selected for by growth on G418 / YPD plates and confirmed by PCR ( Supplementary Table 2b ) . Integrants were grown in 2 % Gal −Ura minimal synthetic medium overnight for removal of the KAN R marker . Colonies that grew on YPD but not G418 / YPD plates were screened by PCR analysis to confirm both KAN R removal ( Supplementary Table 2b ) and PP7 / MS2 hairpin copy number ( Supplementary Table 2c ) . Cells were transformed with 300 ng P Met25 PCP - 2yEGFP ( pDZ270 ) or P Met25 MCP - 2yEGFP ( pDZ274 ) and visualized by epifluorescence to confirm expression and labe - ling of MDN1 mRNAs . Yeast enhanced GFP , or yEGFP , repre - sents a GFP variant that has been codon optimized for enhanced fluorescence in Candida albicans . We have had success labeling mRNA by fusing two yEGFP molecules to the C - terminal end of the coa protein 10 . Tetrads for both PP7 and MS2 integrants were dissected and plated on selective medium , and haploid mat - ing type was determined by single - colony PCR ( Supplementary Table 2d , e ) . Haploids were again visualized by epifluorescence to confirm expression and labeling of MDN1 mRNAs . All two - color experiments were carried out by coexpressing PCP - 2yEGFP and MCP - mCherry . Fluorescent haploids strains ( MDN1 - 24PP7 + P Met25 PCP - 2yEGFP and MDN1 - 24MS2 + P Met25 MCP - mCherry ) were mated on selective plates to produce diploids that contain two 3 ′ - tagged MDN1 alleles and express two sets of uniquely labeled MDN1 mRNAs . The intramolecular strain containing a dual tagging of MDN1 was constructed by genomic insertion by homologous recombination of a DNA fragment ( from pDZ570 ) containing a histidine selectable marker , GAL promoter and 24PP7 into the 5 ′ end of a diploid MDN1 - 24MS2 strain . FISH . MDN1 expression levels were measured by single - molecule FISH according to the procedure previously detailed 6 , 21 . Cells were grown at 30 °C in liquid medium to an optical density ( OD 600 ) of 0 . 6 – 0 . 8 and fixed by addition of 32 % ( v / v ) paraformaldehyde to the culture ( final concentration of 4 % paraformaldehyde ) for 45 min at room temperature . Yeast cell walls were digested at 30 °C with lyticase ( Sigma ) , and resulting spheroblasts were deposited on poly - l - lysine – coated ( Sigma ) cover slips and stored in 70 % ( v / v ) ethanol at −20 °C . Cells were then rehydrated in 2× SSC followed by 2× SSC / 40 % ( v / v ) formamide . Coverslips were inverted onto 20 µ L hybridization solution containing 0 . 5 ng of dye - conjugated DNA probes ( Supplementary Table 3 ) and left at 37 °C overnight . Coverslips were then washed in 2× SSC / 40 % ( v / v ) formamide for 15 min at 37 °C followed by 2× SSC / 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 at room temperature for 15 min and 1× SSC at room temperature for 15 min . Nuclei were stained in 1× PBS containing 0 . 5 µ g / mL DAPI , and coverslips were mounted onto slides using ProLong Gold antifade reagent ( Invitrogen ) and sealed with nail polish . FISH imaging . FISH samples were imaged with an Olympus BX61 epifluorescence microscope using an Olympus UPlanApo 100× / 1 . 35 - NA oil - immersion objective . Illumination was achieved using an X - Cite 120 PC ( EXFO ) light source with 31000 ( DAPI ) and SP - 102v1 ( cy3 ) filter sets ( Chroma Technology ) . Images were acquired using IPLab ( BD Biosciences ) software for instru - ment control and a CoolSNAP HQ camera ( Photometrics ) with a 6 . 4 - µ m pixel size CCD . Serial z sections were collected every 0 . 2 µ m over a vertical range of 4 µ m and max projected before data analysis . Live - cell imaging . Yeast were inoculated at very low OD and grown in synthetic minimal medium for 12 – 16 h at 30 °C to a final OD 600 of 0 . 1 – 0 . 2 . Cells were centrifuged at 4 , 000 r . p . m . for 3 min , and pellets were resuspended in 2 mL fresh medium . We prepared 35 - mm glass - bottom microwell dishes ( MatTek ) for adhesion by coating them with 1 mg / mL filter - sterilized Concanavalin A ( Sigma ) for 5 min and then subjecting them to a brief wash . 400 µ L cell suspension was added to the dish , and cells were allowed to settle and adhere for 5 min . The suspen - sion was then aspirated off and immediately replaced with 3 mL fresh medium containing 1 % ( v / v ) OxyFluor ( Oxyrase ) antibleach reagent and 20 mM sodium dl - lactate ( Sigma ) , added slowly to the periphery of the dish so as not to disrupt adhered cells . Dishes were taken to the microscope and placed on the stage maintained in a 30 °C / 60 % Rh enclosure ( Precision Plastics ) for 30 min to ensure stable imaging conditions . Cells were imaged on a custom - built epifluorescence inverted microscope ( Olympus ) using a 150× / 1 . 45 - NA UApo objective ( Olympus ) . Fluorescence excitation sources include a 488 - nm Ar + laser ( Melles Griot ) , a 561 - nm diode - pumped solid - state laser ( Cobalt ) and a 436 - nm diode laser ( Power Technologies ) for imaging GFP , mCherry and CFP , respectively . Fluorescence was filtered using band - pass emission filters ( Semrock ) and imaged using an iXon back - illuminated EMCCD camera ( Andor ) . Images were acquired using MetaMorph ( Molecular Devices ) . Visualization of single molecules was achieved using 90 - ms exposures and 1 . 9 - mW laser intensity for GFP - labeled mRNAs and 2 . 4 - mW laser inten - sity for mCherry - labeled mRNAs ( as measured from the back focal plane ) . Nuclei were visualized by low - power excitation of the H2A2 - yECFP histone fusion protein . Z stacks were collected as the stage performed a continuous ‘ z sweep’ over 4 . 5 µ m , with the EMCCD reading out every 0 . 75 µ m ( stack size = 7 ) . These z sweeps were critical to achieving high - intensity yet rapid acqui - sition through the cell so as to minimize blurring of diffusing mRNAs and prevent oversampling of mRNAs within the cell vol - ume . Time - lapse two - color movies were imaged in this manner every 20 min , and z stacks were max projected before analysis . Intramolecular two - color experiments were imaged using the same z - sweep parameters . Cells were shifted from raffinose to galactose - containing medium and imaged every 2 min for 28 min to visualize the appearance of 5 ′ and 3 ′ signals . Low - intensity laser illumination was used to limit photobleaching and because resolution of single transcripts was not required . Data analysis . Three - dimensional stacks underwent maximum - intensity projection along the z axis . A previously described two - dimensional Gaussian mask algorithm 22 was implemented through custom - made software for the IDL platform ( ITT Visual n p g © 2013 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . nature methods doi : 10 . 1038 / nmeth . 2305 Information Solutions ) . Diffraction - limited fluorescence signal was used to identify and count single mRNAs for both FISH and live - cell images . Cellular boundaries were defined by a hand - drawn mask using a custom script in ImageJ and combined with detection data using custom - made software in IDL to compute the total number of mRNA molecules per cell . MDN1 expression kinetics were evaluated using the change in mRNA copy number for each allele between frames acquired 20 min apart ; Pearson’s correlations were determined using GraphPad Prism ( GraphPad Software ) , and the fluctuation heat map and histograms were generated using MATLAB ( MathWorks ) . At each time frame , cell - cycle stage was assessed using nuclear H2A2 - yECFP fluorescence signal in conjunction with cellular morphology . The histogram for the time delay between the appearance of 5 ′ and 3 ′ signal in intramolecular experiments was also generated using GraphPad Prism . Calculations for elongation rates were done by dividing the length of the gene by this time for 42 cells . 21 . Zenklusen , D . & Singer , R . H . Methods Enzymol . 470 , 641 – 659 ( 2010 ) . 22 .
