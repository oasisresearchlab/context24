Objective : To provide a comprehensive epidemiologic account of a SARS outbreak from an affected territory . Design : Epidemiologic analysis . Setting : The 2003 Hong Kong SARS outbreak . Participants : All 1755 cases and 302 deaths . Measurements : Sociodemographic characteristics ; infection clusters by time , occupation , setting , and workplace ; and geospa - tial relationships were determined . The mean and variance in the time from infection to onset ( incubation period ) were estimated in a small group of patients with known exposure . The mean and variance in time from onset to admission , from admission to discharge , or from admission to death were calculated . Logistic regression was used to identify important predictors of case fa - tality . Results : 49 . 3 % of patients were infected in clinics , hospitals , or elderly or nursing homes , and the Amoy Gardens cluster ac - counted for 18 . 8 % of cases . The ratio of women to men among infected individuals was 5 : 4 . Health care workers accounted for 23 . 1 % of all reported cases . The estimated mean incubation pe - riod was 4 . 6 days ( 95 % CI , 3 . 8 to 5 . 8 days ) . Mean time from symptom onset to hospitalization varied between 2 and 8 days , decreasing over the course of the epidemic . Mean time from onset to death was 23 . 7 days ( CI , 22 . 0 to 25 . 3 days ) , and mean time from onset to discharge was 26 . 5 days ( CI , 25 . 8 to 27 . 2 days ) . Increasing age , male sex , atypical presenting symptoms , presence of comorbid conditions , and high lactate dehydrogenase level on admission were associated with a greater risk for death . Limitations : Estimates of the incubation period relied on statis - tical assumptions because few patients had known exposure times . Temporal changes in case management as the epidemic progressed , unavailable treatment information , and several poten - tially important factors that could not be thoroughly analyzed because of the limited sample size complicate interpretation of factors related to case fatality . Conclusions : This analysis of the complete data on the 2003 SARS epidemic in Hong Kong has revealed key epidemiologic features of the epidemic as it evolved .

S evere acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) was the ﬁrst newly emergent communicable disease epidemic of the 21st century . During the ﬁrst epidemic of this new patho - gen , 29 countries were affected . The ﬁrst human case was identiﬁed in Guangdong , China , on 16 November 2002 ( 1 ) , and the last known case with a symptom onset date of 5 July 2003 was identiﬁed in Taiwan . The epidemic re - portedly infected 8098 individuals , 774 of whom died ( 2 ) . Hong Kong bore a large proportion of this morbidity and mortality burden : 1755 cases and 302 deaths occurred from 15 February to 31 May 2003 . Hong Kong also pro - vided the link between the cases in China and those in other parts of the world . The resurgence of SARS is dis - tinctly possible given its uncertain origins and the likely existence of an animal reservoir , the palm civet cat ( 3 ) . Since the end of the ﬁrst major epidemic in July 2003 , 4 new cases were reported from Guangdong province in China in late 2003 and early 2004 . An account of the epidemiology of SARS in Hong Kong was undertaken during the outbreak ( 4 ) to inform public health policymaking . The data set has since been updated by using information of all 1755 reported cases , allowing for the relaxation of parametric assumptions , nec - essary in the mid - epidemic analysis , in the analysis of the times from symptoms to admission , admission to death , and admission to discharge . Furthermore , complete case data of the closed cohort allow analysis of predictors of SARS - related death by using logistic regression . We present an epidemiologic analysis of the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong on the basis of all reported cases and deaths classiﬁed according to prevailing World Health Organiza - tion ( WHO ) guidelines . In addition , laboratory veriﬁca - tion by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) test or SARS coronavirus antibody serologic test was obtained for 83 . 6 % of cases . On the basis of the com - plete data set , we present the following analyses : a detailed description of the temporal and spatial evolution of the epidemic ; the estimates of key epidemiologic distributions and their stability over the course of the epidemic ; and the characteristics of those who contracted the disease , includ - ing factors associated with the likelihood of death from SARS coronavirus infection . M ETHODS Sources of Data We analyzed an integrated database ( SARSID ) , de - rived from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority eSARS sys - Article 662 © 2004 American College of Physicians tem and the Hong Kong Department of Health’s master list , which contained details on all patients reported to have SARS who were hospitalized in Hong Kong through - out the epidemic . The eSARs system is a secure , Web - based data repository that contains mostly real - time clinical data entered on the SARS patient wards . Trained nurses retrospectively collected and conﬁrmed some data ﬁelds by a detailed chart review according to a standardized proto - col . The Hong Kong Department of Health’s master list mostly consisted of information from the questionnaires of case and case contact data . We administered the question - naires ( containing case and case contact information ) , mostly through telephone interviews , to all patients with SARS conﬁrmed by the Hong Kong Department of Health ; in most cases , the questionnaire was administered within 3 days ( up to a maximum of 1 week ) of initial presentation with SARS . For patients who could not be contacted or who were too ill to be interviewed , we ob - tained proxy reporting from an immediate family member who was most familiar with the medical and contact his - tory of the patient before infection . Four regional ﬁeld ofﬁces initially administered these questionnaires , and a central interviewing team of nurses later recorded symp - toms at presentation to the hospital and identiﬁed contacts and events of probable signiﬁcance to transmission . We collected data on case and contact information for all 1755 patients with SARS , although we did not complete all data elements for all cases . The Appendix ( available at www . annals . org ) provides detailed clinical case deﬁnitions for SARS throughout the 2003 epidemic . We based laboratory conﬁrmation of SARS on labora - tory techniques that were consistent with the WHO case deﬁnition for laboratory conﬁrmed SARS ( 5 ) : 1 ) RT - PCR for SARS coronavirus and 2 ) serologic testing for IgG an - tibodies against SARS coronavirus . A patient was consid - ered to have laboratory - conﬁrmed SARS if there was a positive RT - PCR result from 2 or more clinical specimens , either from different sites or tested in different laboratories , obtained from patients before or after death or if there was seroconversion by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , indirect ﬂuorescent antibody test , or neutraliza - tion assay . Although these tests were mostly available dur - ing the outbreak , not all patients were tested for any or all of them for various reasons , including nonuniform testing protocol ( especially in the earlier part of the outbreak ) , lack of samples due to early case fatality without autopsy exam - ination , and inadequate and missing specimens . Test vari - ables , such as sensitivity and speciﬁcity , were unknown because there were no “gold standard” laboratory or clini - copathologic deﬁnitions for the diagnosis of SARS , a new and emerging disease , for comparing diagnostic test perfor - mance . The IgG antibodies against SARS coronavirus found on serologic testing seemed to be the best method for conﬁrming SARS in largely seronegative populations ( 6 ) , where the reported seropositivity rate reached 93 % to 99 % in Hong Kong ( 7 , 8 ) and 96 . 2 % in Toronto ( 9 ) . We collected paired serologic specimens at least 21 to 28 days apart , although anecdotal reports of longitudinal follow - up of patients with SARS in Hong Kong estimate that sero - conversion can occur as long as 6 months after acute ill - ness . Tang and colleagues ( 9 ) found that the sensitivity of 1 ﬁrst - generation RT - PCR was 54 . 1 % in their Toronto SARS case series , assuming that all clinically classiﬁed pa - tients truly had SARS . These ﬁndings were broadly similar to those reported by Peiris and colleagues ( 8 ) for the out - break at Amoy Gardens housing estate in Hong Kong dur - ing late March and early April . In both the Hong Kong and Toronto epidemics ( 8 , 9 ) , the peak rate of RT - PCR positivity occurred 9 to 11 days after ﬁrst symptoms pre - sented , and gastrointestinal specimens gave higher yields than respiratory samples . Poon and colleagues ( 10 ) later produced a second - generation RT - PCR assay capable of detecting SARS coronavirus in up to 88 % of respiratory tract samples obtained within the ﬁrst 3 days after illness onset in conﬁrmed SARS cases in the Hong Kong out - break . This test kit was adopted in the latter part of the Hong Kong epidemic . All SARS coronavirus specimen testing in Hong Kong was performed in 3 designated lab - oratories ( Chinese University of Hong Kong , University of Hong Kong , and Hong Kong Department of Health ) where rigorous quality control procedures were established . The World Health Oranization and members of the WHO SARS Reference and Veriﬁcation Laboratory Net - work certiﬁed all 3 facilities as reference laboratories . Statistical Analysis We constructed the epidemic time series on the basis of all 1755 local cases by date of symptom onset and in - fection cluster . We classiﬁed infection clusters by probable transmission setting ( institutional vs . community spread ) , location ( for example , housing estates ) , occupation ( for ex - Context Few comprehensive studies describe the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) . Contribution This epidemiologic analysis of 1755 cases from Hong Kong found that most cases clustered in hospitals and residential buildings . Close human contact and spread by a sewage system probably explain the clustering . The outbreak lasted about 3 months . The estimated mean incubation period was 4 . 6 days , and the case - fatality ratio was 17 % . Factors associated with increased risk for death included older age and male sex . Implications The observed patterns suggested that SARS had low trans - missibility , except in settings of intimate contact or clini - cally significant environmental contamination . – The Editors Article SARS Epidemiology in Hong Kong www . annals . org 2 November 2004 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 141 • Number 9 663 ample , health care workers in public and private sectors ) , and workplace ( for example , hospitals and other build - ings ) . We compared the age and sex distributions of SARS cases with general population estimates derived from the 2001 population census conducted by the Hong Kong Government Census and Statistics Department . To illustrate the geospatial pattern of infection and disease spread , we used a geographic information system ( ArcGIS , Environmental Systems Research Institute , Red - lands , California ) to construct a map of infection clusters in different districts of Hong Kong . We plotted empirical distributions for times from on - set to admission , onset to death , and onset to discharge after recovery ( from acute care since many patients were transferred to convalescent facilities ) , and we calculated the mean and variance of these distributions ( Appendix , avail - able at www . annals . org ) . Infection events cannot be ob - served , but data on patients with short and well - deﬁned periods of 1 exposure to known SARS cases can be used to estimate the distribution of the time from infection to on - set of symptoms ( the incubation period ) by using methods for interval - censored data ( 4 , 11 ) . The database contained 81 patients who had 1 exposure to a conﬁrmed SARS case over a limited time scale ( (cid:1) 15 days ) with recorded start and end dates , who did not travel , and who were not hos - pitalized before the onset of symptoms . We estimated the distribution by using maximum likelihood methods , as - suming a (cid:1) distribution . We used logistic regression to identify factors signiﬁ - cantly associated with case fatality due to SARS . The fol - lowing variables were tested in the model : age ; sex ; occu - pation ( health care worker vs . others ) ; symptoms on presentation ( typical [ patients with SARS whose symptom score as determined by the prediction rule was above the threshold designated as high risk for SARS ] vs . atypical [ patients with SARS whose score was below the threshold designated as low risk for SARS ] , as determined according to a clinical prediction model reported separately [ 12 ] ) ; infection cluster ; calendar period of infection as deﬁned by the symptom onset date ; time from onset to admission ; presence of preexisting comorbid conditions ( including asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , cardiovas - cular disease , cerebrovascular disease , cancer , diabetes mel - litus , chronic renal disease , and chronic liver disease ) ; lac - tate dehydrogenase level as a ratio to the upper limit of normal as an indicator of disease severity on admission ; and time ( days ) between the onset of symptoms and initi - ation of ribavirin therapy . We entered factors into the model on the basis of hypotheses about possible candidate predictors of mortality in the literature ( 4 , 13 – 15 ) at the time of analysis . The categorization of variables , including the assignment of the reference categories , was speciﬁed a priori . We included all patients in the logistic regression models , and we used multiple imputation methods to han - dle missing data items . We imputed the missing data by expectation with importance resampling algorithm ( 16 ) by using AMELIA software ( Aptech Systems , Inc . , Maple Val - ley , Washington ) ( 17 ) . We generated 10 imputations and analyzed them separately , and we combined the results to estimate the within - imputation and between - imputation variability ( 18 ) . For sensitivity analysis , we omitted the lac - tate dehydrogenase level and atypical versus typical symp - tom variables ( the 2 factors with the most missing items ) from the regression equation to test the robustness of the baseline model ﬁndings . We plotted the probability of survival or mortality curves stratiﬁed by age to illustrate the dependence of time to death for those who died with these demographic vari - ables . We repeated these analyses on the 1467 patients with laboratory conﬁrmation of SARS . We used Stata , version 8 . 0 ( Stata Corp , College Station , Texas ) , for all statistical analyses . Role of the Funding Sources The funding sources had no role in the design , con - duct , and reporting of the study or in the decision to sub - mit the manuscript for publication . R ESULTS Laboratory Confirmation of SARS Status Of the 1755 patients , 1467 patients ( 83 . 6 % ) met the prespeciﬁed criteria for laboratory conﬁrmation of SARS : 447 seroconverted and had 2 or more positive RT - PCR results , 959 seroconverted only , and 61 had 2 or more positive RT - PCR results only . The remaining 288 patients did not meet criteria for laboratory conﬁrmation for vari - ous reasons , such as inadequate or insufﬁcient specimens ( n (cid:2) 199 ) or negative RT - PCR or serologic test results ( n (cid:2) 89 ) . Time The patient who initiated the largest transmission chain throughout the territory and who , in turn , seeded the global outbreak , was a medical professor from Guang - dong province in mainland China who ﬁrst showed symp - toms on 15 February and was subsequently hospitalized on 22 February , 1 day after arriving in Hong Kong ( 19 ) . The development of the epidemic featured a period of exponen - tial growth , beginning on 10 March , after the formal an - nouncement of the outbreak , which was further exacer - bated by transmission not related to intimate personal contact , probably through the sewage system ( 19 ) , in Amoy Gardens residential buildings and their immediate neighborhood . A period of comparative stability in early to mid - April occurred , with evidence of weakening beginning the week of 22 April . The last patient with SARS ﬁrst experienced symptoms on 31 May and was hospitalized on 2 June ( Figure 1 ) . Place Figure 1 and Table 1 show that half ( 49 % ) of the SARS cases were the result of infection in clinics , public Article SARS Epidemiology in Hong Kong 664 2 November 2004 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 141 • Number 9 www . annals . org and private hospitals , or elderly or nursing homes . Another important setting of disease spread was the superspreading event in Amoy Gardens that resulted in daily incidence counts of close to 100 cases per day at the height of the outbreak in late March . Spread within residential buildings accounted for 22 % of all cases , mostly at the Amoy Gar - dens housing estate . We classiﬁed an additional 7 % of total cases as “Amoy Gardens nearby . ” This label refers to pa - tients with SARS who were living in the immediate neigh - borhood of Amoy Gardens and were believed to be linked to the main Amoy Gardens cluster but were not residents of the housing estate . About 5 % of Hong Kong’s cases were imported ( or reimported ) from overseas or from air travel . Fewer than 10 % of all cases resulted from transmis - sion in the general community ( aside from the super - spreading event in Amoy Gardens ) , including household settings . Of this community transmission , 64 % ( 97 of 152 cases ) could be attributed to intrafamilial or within - house - hold spread , deﬁned as transmission from 1 household or family member to another with no other known sources of infectious contact . Figure 2 illustrates the geographic locations of SARS infection by patients’ residential address . The size of the circle corresponds to the density of cases in a particular location . Cases clearly clustered in certain districts of the Kowloon peninsula ( Kwun Tong , in which Amoy Gardens is located ) and the New Territories ( including Shatin and Tai Po districts where the Prince of Wales Hospital and Alice Ho Mui Ling Nethersole Hospital , sites of large nos - ocomial outbreaks , are situated , respectively ) , but Hong Kong Island was relatively spared . Clustering became ap - parent as the epidemic unfolded , with per capita incidence varying signiﬁcantly between districts ( 4 , 20 ) . People Overall , the ratio of women to men among infected individuals was 5 : 4 ( Table 1 ) . When we compared the age and sex distribution of the Hong Kong general population , we found a clear excess of young adults , especially women ( 102 of 254 women with SARS 25 to 34 years of age were nurses ) , infected with SARS and a relative deﬁcit of chil - dren and adolescents . Elderly men ( (cid:3) 75 years of age ) were also overrepresented among patients with SARS ( Figure 3 ) , as were elderly women ( (cid:3) 75 years of age ) , although to a lesser extent . Health care workers made up 23 % of all infected persons . Table 2 shows that most infections oc - curred in the public sector ( that is , within the mainly tax - ﬁnanced Hong Kong Hospital Authority , which oversees all 44 public hospitals and provides 95 % of total inpatient bed - days in Hong Kong , with minimal co - payments at the point of care and guaranteed universal access for all resi - dents ) , where all patients with SARS were mainly cared for in 14 designated centers ( some were initially admitted to other hospitals but later transferred ) . Nurses accounted for 52 % of the 405 health care worker cases , and health care assistants ( for example , orderlies ) accounted for 28 % . One in 7 ( 16 % ) health care workers were medical physicians . Key Epidemiologic Variables The estimated mean and variance in the incubation period distribution was 4 . 6 days and 15 . 9 days , respec - tively . In 95 % of patients , symptoms developed within 12 . 5 days of infection . Figure 4 presents the estimated distribution . This distribution is based on a limited num - ber of observations ( only 5 % of the total cases ) and could reﬂect biases in reporting , heterogeneity in routes of trans - mission , or varying infectious doses of the SARS coronavi - rus . On bivariable testing between the 81 patients for whom we estimated the incubation period and the remain - ing patients ( data not shown ) , we found that none was an Amoy Gardens case and that hospital - infected cases were overrepresented . They also tended to have been infected slightly later in the epidemic . Most of the 81 patients had preexisting comorbid conditions . Figure 1 .

We grouped patients by their week of clinical onset , and 11 time periods were analyzed ( Table 3 ) . Not enough pa - tients with symptom onset before 15 February were avail - able for robust analysis . Table 3 shows mean time from onset to admission for each time period . The time from onset to admission statistically signiﬁcantly decreased dur - ing the ﬁrst 5 weeks but not in the last 6 weeks ( Figure 5 , top ) ( Appendix , available at www . annals . org ) .

Survival was highly associated with both age and sex ( Table 1 ) . Men with SARS had a 50 % ( 95 % CI , 7 % to 109 % ) excess risk for death . Mortality increased signiﬁcantly with age ( P (cid:1) 0 . 001 ) . Patterns in survival curves and time to discharge curves varied by age category ( Figure 6 ) . A lower case - fatality ratio was associated with health care worker status ( adjusted odds ratio , 0 . 3 [ CI , 0 . 1 to 0 . 7 ] ) . The presence of preexisting comorbid conditions and greater disease severity ( as proxied by high lactate de - hydrogenase level on admission ) were both associated with a higher risk for death . The calendar time period during which patients became ill was not statistically signiﬁcantly associated with survival , and earlier admission after symp - tom onset and the timing of ribavirin administration were not protective . The precise infection cluster that a patient belonged to was not a signiﬁcant predictor . Analyses based on the subset of 1467 patients with laboratory conﬁrmation of SARS generally produced re - sults similar to those presented on the full cohort ( see Ap - pendix , Appendix Tables 1 and 2 , and Appendix Figures 1 and 2 for further details , available at www . annals . org ) . However , we note that health care worker status ( adjusted odds ratio , 0 . 6 [ CI , 0 . 2 to 1 . 3 ] ) was no longer statistically signiﬁcantly associated with survival for the subset of lab - oratory - conﬁrmed SARS coronavirus cases . While we rec - ognize that the differences between the 2 sets of data are clinically important , we believe that data from the full co - hort of 1755 patients are the main results partly because 199 of 288 non – laboratory - conﬁrmed cases did not have adequate or sufﬁcient clinical specimens to be tested but nonetheless fulﬁlled clinical and epidemiologic criteria to be diagnosed as SARS before laboratory testing . This is very different from the scenario in which both RT - PCR and serologic tests were performed but the results were negative . In addition , we accounted for the inﬂuence of missing data on the stability of the logistic regression mod - els ( that is , both models of 1755 and 1467 patients ) by multiple imputation and through a series of sensitivity analyses . We excluded the 2 variables with the most miss - ing values ( atypical symptoms and lactate dehydrogenase level on admission ) from the regression model and per - formed a complete case analysis ( without multiple imputa - tion ) . The results were robust , achieved statistical signiﬁ - cance , and showed similar directionality and magnitude of associations . D ISCUSSION Our ﬁndings summarize the time course and patient location of Hong Kong’s 2003 SARS outbreak and the characteristics of those infected . The time course of the epidemic was marked by an initial period of exponential growth that eventually started to decrease after 6 weeks of intensive public health control measures ( 22 ) . Substantial geospatial clustering was observed , with several large clus - ters of SARS cases in hospital and residential settings and a high proportion of health care workers . These observations are largely consistent with those reported for the Singapore and Toronto outbreaks , where the hospital environment substantially ampliﬁed the risk for infection ( 14 , 23 , 24 ) . The pattern of infection clusters ( Table 1 ) also suggests that the transmissibility of viral infection is low , except in settings of intimate contact or where clinically signiﬁcant environmental contamination has occurred . It may also suggest low infectiousness in patients for some days after the onset of clinical symptoms . In addition , the risk for acquiring infection varied signiﬁcantly by age , with rela - tively few cases of infection and no deaths in children and adolescents . The reasons for this are unclear .

Alternative hypotheses , including one that suggests that more recent infections in young pa - tients with other coronaviruses confer some degree of pro - tection to SARS coronavirus due to antigenic cross - reactiv - ity , have not as yet been tested . Current prevailing theories focus on an attenuated immunopathologic response in children because of a more immature immune system ( 26 ) . However , the exact mechanism that leads to SARS coro - navirus – induced immunomodulation remains to be eluci - dated ( 27 ) . A key aspect of infection control introduced during the epidemic was a policy of quarantine , in which individ - uals who were possibly infected or had contact with known SARS cases were isolated for a ﬁxed period . This period was deﬁned by timely estimates of the time from exposure to ﬁrst symptoms ( that is , the incubation period distribu - tion ) ( 4 , 28 ) . Our analyses of the full data set suggest that the duration of quarantine may need to be reconsidered . The World Health Organization and the Centers for Dis - ease Control and Prevention currently recommend a pe - riod of 10 days , but our results indicate that 13 days may be necessary to capture 95 % of all possible cases ( 2 , 29 ) . We stress that our estimation procedure adopted a para - metric (cid:1) distribution and thus implicitly assumed the pos - sibility of very long incubation periods . Another caveat is that , because of methodologic constraints , this distribution was ﬁtted to data on a very small subset of cases with a single exposure source with known start and end dates ; thus , the generalizability of these ﬁndings to the whole Table 3 .

Future research should closely exam - ine the relative merits and drawbacks of different statistical approaches to estimating this critical distribution , since such estimates are central to public health and infection control policymaking . Our analysis of the onset to admission interval shows a progressive shortening of time from clinical onset of symp - toms to presentation at the hospital , probably because of heightened community awareness of SARS and a high in - Figure 5 .

Article SARS Epidemiology in Hong Kong 670 2 November 2004 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 141 • Number 9 www . annals . org dex of suspicion among health care providers as the epi - demic unfolded ( 22 ) . Coupled with the observation that SARS almost exclusively manifests as a ﬂorid clinical syn - drome requiring inpatient treatment and only very rarely as a subclinical or mild infection ( that is , with no asymptom - atic carriers of the disease [ 25 , 30 ] ) , reducing the onset - to - admission interval to a minimum ( that is , 2 days by the end of the Hong Kong epidemic ) is possible and can be an effective public health control measure . Since almost no asymptomatic or even mildly symptomatic cases of SARS have occurred , infected individuals can recognize their own illness relatively easily and thus can promptly present themselves to the health care system . This allows the rapid isolation of infectious individuals , hence reducing the ef - fective infectious period and the risk for transmission . Such was empirically observed in Singapore , where generation of secondary infections by index cases was substantial only if the onset - to - admission ( isolation ) interval exceeded 5 days ( 23 ) . However , shortening the time between ﬁrst symp - toms and the initiation of treatment on hospitalization does not seem to increase the probability of survival . More generally , clinical studies of the typical course of infection in patients with SARS coronavirus suggests that the average peak infectiousness may occur some 8 to 9 days after onset of clinical symptoms ( 8 ) . This biological pattern , which is very atypical for most respiratory tract or gastrointestinal tract infections , implies that prompt isolation after onset of clinical symptoms is a very effective public health measure for this particular infection . This observation also partly explains the high fraction of cases that occurred in health care workers in Hong Kong , Singapore , Taipei , and To - ronto , since they had contact with patients during their peak infectiousness phase ( 14 , 15 , 31 , 32 ) . The onset - to - death and onset - to - discharge - after - recov - ery distributions add substantial information to the natural history of the disease process ( mostly among treated pa - tients ) and underline the importance of patients’ age and sex in determining the course of illness . They allow future clinicians to understand the relative distributions of time to clinical outcomes and compare SARS in this outbreak to that of future outbreaks should they occur . The lower mean and variability in the onset - to - death interval distri - bution among the deceased elderly patients were probably due to their relative fragility and higher prevalence of co - morbid conditions . On the other hand , while factors such as post - SARS disability and treatment complications might have led to a longer hospital stay for the elderly survivors , some of these patients were hospitalized for treatment of other diseases after recovery from SARS . The modal peak of the onset - to - discharge interval distribution at around 21 days in Figure 5 ( bottom ) was , to an extent , an artifact of administrative guidelines of the minimum 21 days of hos - pitalization , which had been in effect since early April 2003 . Our previous estimation of epidemiolgic variables and case - fatality ratios during an ongoing epidemic is compli - cated by the open cohort problem of censoring , such that ascertaining who will eventually die or be discharged among those still hospitalized is impossible at the time of the analysis . This is further complicated by the temporal evolution of the epidemic , with incident cases continually being added to the pool of infected individuals ( 4 ) . In this analysis of all 1755 consecutive cases in Hong Kong , we observed the outcomes in all cases . Hence , issues about censoring do not apply . Although the overall case - fatality ratio was 17 . 2 % , this average ﬁgure masks the substantial variation in case fatal - ity by age . Male sex , more severe illness on presentation as proxied by lactate dehydrogenase level , and the presence of preexisting comorbid conditions were also signiﬁcantly as - sociated with a high case - fatality rate in the multivariable analysis . The timing of ribavirin administration did not seem to statistically signiﬁcantly inﬂuence clinical out - come , possibly because of residual confounding or insufﬁ - cient power to detect a difference given that most patients were treated . We caution that our observations from the model are tentative and must be externally conﬁrmed in other settings given the many remaining uncertainties in - volving patient’s clinical course ; other treatments received ; and the temporal evolution of triage , diagnosis , and care patterns throughout the epidemic . Previous analyses of case - fatality predictors have examined only small , hospital - based data sets with limited information on a comprehen - sive range of personal and clinical variables , although their ﬁndings were similar to ours , such as the effects of age , sex , comorbid conditions , and high lactate dehydrogenase lev - els on mortality ( 14 , 15 , 33 ) . One weakness in analysis of all the major SARS outbreaks was insufﬁcient attention given to the need to construct databases of treatment on the basis of information from all clinical settings that would permit analyses with sufﬁcient patient numbers of what treatments worked best for what type of patient . In other jurisdictions , treatment data were not shared among clinical settings in order to create sufﬁcient numbers of patients to permit analysis . In this context , even with the largest case cohort in Hong Kong , statistical power is in - sufﬁcient to examine all the important factors that might inﬂuence case fatality . More detailed analysis involving other relevant clinical factors , such as the use of noninva - sive assisted ventilation or other medications ( for example , lopinavir – ritonavir combination ) and associated timing , as well as longitudinal observations of clinical and laboratory variables , should be undertaken to clarify some of the un - resolved issues . Ideally , deﬁnitive answers to the best treatment regi - men for patients with SARS require large randomized , con - trolled trials with clear outcomes deﬁned a priori and suf - ﬁciently long follow - up . Such trials would need to monitor the possible side effects of candidate drugs , including the putative association of large doses of pulsed steroids with the subsequent development of avascular necrosis in some patients versus such complications being part of the clinical Article SARS Epidemiology in Hong Kong www . annals . org 2 November 2004 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 141 • Number 9 671 picture of SARS . In the heat of a crisis , however , random - ized , controlled trials are typically not possible . As such , observational studies based on amalgamated data sets from different clinical settings are the only way to assess treat - ment value . In drawing conclusions from such analyses , bias may be present in patient choice for any given treat - ment , and this must be considered during interpretation . More generally , public health authorities worldwide should establish well - designed and appropriately resourced protocols of randomized , controlled trials to properly eval - uate the efﬁcacy of various management strategies should a SARS outbreak recur ( 34 ) . Although SARS is unlikely to return as a large epidemic across many different countries like the 2003 outbreak , clinical investigators must recog - nize the importance of collaboration on multinational , multicenter epidemiologic studies or clinical trials to in - crease the power to detect moderate effects of treatment regimens and associated risk factors ( 34 , 35 ) .

Exclusion criteria were clinically signiﬁcant bronchiectasis , leukocytosis on admission , chest radiograph showing lobar con - solidation , or already known pathogen . On 10 April 2003 , the case deﬁnition of SARS was updated with the changes in the WHO case deﬁnition and with local clinical experience . The revised case deﬁnition of SARS was the presence of new radio - logic inﬁltrates compatible with pneumonia ; body temperature of 38 °C or greater or history of such in the last 2 days ; and the presence of at least 2 of the following : history of chills in the past 2 days , cough ( new or increased cough ) or breathing difﬁculty , general malaise or myalgia , or known history of exposure . Exclusion criteria were replaced by only 1 variable : A case would be excluded if an alternative diagnosis could fully explain the illness . By using this updated case deﬁnition , the Hong Kong Hospital Authority eSARS registry included 1755 patients . Symptom Onset Date Symptom onset date is deﬁned as the date on which the patient ﬁrst experienced symptoms of SARS . We determined the symptom onset date on the basis of 2 sources . Upon a patient’s entry into the eSARS registry , the Hong Kong Department of Health administered 2 questionnaires ( a case questionnaire and a case contact survey ) , mostly through telephone interviews , to all patients in the eSARS registry . Frontline nurses later captured patients’ symptom onset date from physicians’ admission notes and entered them into the Hong Kong Hospital Authority eS - ARS database . There were minor differences between the 2 sources of data , and we adopted the former set of data in this analysis to minimize recall and transcription bias . Admission Date Admission date is the patient’s date of admission for the SARS episode . For SARS episodes that started during a patient’s hospitalization for a non - SARS illness , admission date refers to the date of admission for the initial non - SARS illness . Biphasic Linear Model A biphasic linear model was ﬁtted to the onset to admission interval , with onset category as the independent variable to test for temporal changes in this key variable throughout the duration of the 2003 epidemic in Hong Kong ( 36 ) . This biphasic linear model may be important because it measures how quickly infec - tious individuals in the community were isolated and treated in hospitals . In the biphasic linear model , we constrained the 2 linear regression segments to meet at the same breakpoint corre - sponding to a particular onset category . For each breakpoint ( 11 breakpoints in total ) , we solved the model by the maximum likelihood approach ( 36 ) , and the ﬁnal breakpoint was associated with the model with the largest likelihood .
