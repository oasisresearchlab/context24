Front – rear polarity of migrating cells is determined by local activation of a signaling network involving Cdc42 and other factors in response to spatial cues from the environment , the nature of which are obscure . We examined the roles of laminin ( LM ) - 511 and LM - 332 , two structurally different laminin isoforms , in the migration of Madin – Darby canine kidney cells by suppressing expression of their α subunits using RNA interference . We determined that knockdown of LM - 511 inhibits directional migration and destabilizes cell – cell contacts , in part by disturbing the localization and activity of the polarization machinery . Suppression of integrin α 3 , a laminin receptor subunit , in cells synthesizing normal amounts of both laminins has a similar effect as knockdown of LM - 511 . Surprisingly , simultaneous sup - pression of both laminin α 5 and laminin α 3 restores directional migration and cell – cell contact stability , suggesting that cells recognize a haptotactic gradient formed by a combination of laminins . INTRODUCTION Sustained directional migration of cells depends on establishment of stable front – rear polarity ( Iden and Collard , 2008 ; Nelson , 2009 ; Petrie et al . , 2009 ) . Extracellular “spatial cues” ( Drubin and Nelson , 1996 ) from the environment activate the small GTPase Cdc42 , lead - ing to a cascade of events that include assembly of polarity protein complexes and stable orientation of the cytoskeleton and mem - brane trafficking in the direction of migration ( Iden and Collard , 2008 ; Petrie et al . , 2009 ; Osmani et al . , 2010 ) . In epithelial cells , di - rectional migration is of particular importance in wound healing , in which concerted migration of cells at the wound edge is required for efficient repair ( Friedl and Gilmour , 2009 ) . Dysregulation of direc - tional migration , on the other hand , may contribute to metastasis in epithelial cancers ( Marinkovich , 2007 ; Friedl and Gilmour , 2009 ) . The nature of spatial cues that initiate directional migration in epithelial cells is poorly understood but may involve proteins of the extracellular matrix such as isoforms of laminin ( Zhang and Kramer , 1996 ; Plopper et al . , 1998 ; Frank and Carter , 2004 ; Sehgal et al . , 2006 ; Hartwig et al . , 2007 ; Marinkovich , 2007 ) . All laminins are het - erotrimeric proteins composed of distinct α , β , and γ subunits ( Miner and Yurchenco , 2004 ) . Prototypical laminins ( LMs ) such as LM - 511 ( α 5 β 1 γ 1 ) are cross shaped , with short arms contributed by the amino terminus of each subunit and a stem composed of a coiled coil of all three subunits ( Miner and Yurchenco , 2004 ) . Laminin receptors , in - cluding integrins α 3 β 1 and α 6 β 4 , bind primarily to globular domains at the carboxy terminus of the laminin α subunit near the distal end of the coiled coil ( Miner and Yurchenco , 2004 ) . In prototypical lami - nins , LN or polymerization domains occur at the amino terminus of each subunit ; these interact with LN domains of two other molecules to form a network that is the foundation of the basement membrane Monitoring Editor Asma Nusrat Emory University Received : Aug 24 , 2011 Revised : Oct 19 , 2011 Accepted : Oct 20 , 2011 “ASCB ® , “ “The American Society for Cell Biology ® , ” and “Molecular Biology of the Cell ® ” are registered trademarks of The American Society of Cell Biology . © 2012 Greciano et al .

G . Greciano et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell ( Yurchenco , 2011 ) . In contrast , a few laminins , including LM - 332 ( α 3 β 3 γ 2 ) , are composed of truncated subunits lacking one or more LN domains and are incapable of network formation and basement membrane assembly on their own ( Cheng et al . , 1997 ; Miner and Yurchenco , 2004 ; Marinkovich , 2007 ) . Although many cells synthesize more than one isoform of lami - nin , functional interactions between these have generally not been considered ( Miner et al . , 1997 ; Miner and Yurchenco , 2004 ; Sorokin et al . , 1997 ; Aumailley and Rousselle , 1999 ; Calaluce et al . , 2006 ; McMillan et al . , 2006 ; Sugawara et al . , 2007 ; Chiharu et al . , 2010 ) . The Madin – Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cell line , for example , ex - presses both LM - 332 and LM - 511 under certain conditions ( Yu et al . , 2005 ; Mak et al . , 2006 ; Moyano et al . , 2010 ) . In this study we ex - plore the role of LM - 511 in migration of MDCK cells and unexpect - edly discover that directional migration depends on the ratio of the LM - 511 α 5 subunit to that of the LM - 332 α 3 subunit . RESULTS MDCK cells constitutively express LM - 511 In MDCK cells , expression of LM - 332 only occurs in subconfluent cells due to tight transcriptional regulation by transforming growth factor - β ( Mak et al . , 2006 ; Moyano et al . , 2010 ) . To determine the pattern of LM - 511 expression , RNA was extracted from subconflu - ent and confluent MDCK cell cultures , and the amount of α 3 ( LM - 332 ) and α 5 ( LM - 511 ) mRNA was measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR ( qPCR ) . As shown in Figure 1A , levels of α 3 mRNA were substantially reduced in confluent cultures relative to subcon - fluent cultures , as previously reported ( Mak et al . , 2006 ; Moyano et al . , 2010 ) . Laminin α 5 mRNA , on the other hand , was present in significant and approximately equal amounts in both subconfluent and confluent cultures . These results were confirmed by examining synthesis and deposition of LM - 511 by metabolic labeling and im - munofluorescence ( Figure 1 , B – D ) . Thus , subconfluent MDCK cells simultaneously synthesize and deposit both LM - 332 and LM - 511 , whereas confluent cells express only LM - 511 . Suppression of LM - 511 production with short hairpin RNA To investigate the function of LM - 511 in MDCK cells , synthesis of the α 5 subunit was suppressed using retroviral - mediated expression of short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) constructs . Initial experiments with pools of cells demonstrated that knockdown was effective using two different target sequences ( KD2 , KD4 ) at both the mRNA and pro - tein level and was independent of culture confluency ( Figure 1 , E and F ) . Furthermore , knockdown of laminin α 5 had no effect on ei - ther the synthesis or regulation of laminin α 3 expression ( Figure 1E ) . On the basis of these observations , individual stable clones were selected from the two pools and the scrambled sequence control , and clones KD2 . 4 , KD4 . 2 , and Sc . 5 were chosen for further analysis . KD2 . 4 exhibited 57 % suppression of laminin α 5 mRNA and 75 % suppression of α 5 protein , with the values for KD4 . 2 intermediate between those of the Sc . 5 control and KD2 . 4 for protein expression ( 59 % mRNA ; 24 % protein ; Figure 1 , G and H ) . Note that for analysis of the LM - 511 protein in this and subsequent experiments , a poly - clonal anti – LM - 111 antibody that reacts with the β 1 and γ 1 subunits was used because no specific anti - α 5 antibody that reacts with the canine protein is available . Previous work indicated that MDCK cells do not express the α 1 subunit ( Yu et al . , 2005 ; our unpublished data ) . The anti – LM - 332 antibody used here is specific for LM - 332 , although reactivity is primarily against the β 3 and γ 2 subunits . Levels of laminin α 5 deposition into the matrix underlying the cells reflected the other measures of suppression , although unex - pectedly high amounts of β 1 and γ 1 were deposited in the matrix by the suppressed lines ( Figure 1 , I – K ) . One potential explanation of this is that , in the absence of α 5 , the β 1 and γ 1 subunits associate with another laminin α subunit . Because LM - 311 is known to be ex - pressed in some cells , we first tested the possibility that LM α 3 as - sociated with β 1 and γ 1 in the KD2 . 4 suppressed line by sequential immunoprecipitations of matrix deposited by metabolically labeled cultures ( Figure 1J ) . In control Sc . 5 cells , only LM - 511 was detected by immunoprecipitation with anti - LM - 111 , although a small amount of a band migrating at the position of LM α 3 was also seen ( lane 1 ; compare to lane 2 ) . Immunoprecipitation with polyclonal anti – LM - 332 detected primarily LM - 332 , although some faint higher – molecular weight bands were also visible ( lane 2 ) . Sequential pre - cipitation of labeled matrix with first one antibody and then the other ( with an intermediate protein - A precipitation step to eliminate residual amounts of the first antibody ) gave essentially the same results as the single immunoprecipitations ( lanes 3 and 4 ) . When la - beled matrix from KD2 . 4 was immunoprecipitated , the amount of LM - 511 precipitated was much less , as expected , but there was also a clearly noticeable increase in the amount of LM α 3 ( lane 5 ; com - pare to lane 1 ) . Both single and sequential immunoprecipitations of LM - 332 resembled controls ( lanes 6 and 7 ; compare to lanes 2 and 3 ) . However , when first LM - 332 and then LM - 511 were immunopre - cipitated , the anti – LM - 111 antibody used to precipitate LM - 511 de - tected not only β 1 and γ 1 , but also α 3 and some β 3 and γ 2 ( lane 8 ) . Thus , the sequential immunoprecipitation experiment showed that knockdown of LM α 5 expression resulted in increased amounts of what was potentially LM - 311 ( lanes 5 and 8 ) . The appearance of β 3 and γ 2 in lane 8 is , however , difficult to explain unless there is some physical association between different laminin molecules not dis - rupted by the conditions of immunoprecipitation . The conclusion that knockdown of LM α 5 leads to the secretion of LM - 311 is consis - tent with measurements of the relative deposition of subunits ( Figure 1K ) . Deposition of β 1 and γ 1 relative to α 5 in anti – LM - 111 immuno - precipitates is higher in KD2 . 4 than in control Sc . 5 ( Figure 1K , top ) . In contrast , deposition of β 3 and γ 2 relative to α 3 is lower in anti – LM - 332 precipitates , possibly due to the association of a fraction of α 3 with β 1 and γ 1 ( Figure 1K , bottom ) . Another possible explanation for the deposition of increased amounts of β 1 and γ 1 when expression of LM α 5 is suppressed is that expression of a new laminin α subunit is induced by the knock - down . Of the other known laminin α chains , LM α 4 was of particular interest because it is truncated like LM α 3 and , most important , would likely migrate on reducing SDS gels with a mobility similar to that of β 1 and γ 1 and therefore would be difficult to detect . Further - more , LM - 411 is known to be expressed in the kidney under certain circumstances ( Miner et al . , 1997 ; Hansen and Abrass , 2003 ) . To test this , RT - PCR was conducted on RNA prepared from control and sup - pressed lines using primers specific for the canine gene product , but no PCR product corresponding to LM α 4 was detected ( data not shown ) . In addition , deposited matrix from metabolically labeled control and KD2 . 4 cells was immunoprecipitated with anti – LM - 111 and run on an SDS gel without reduction . Under these conditions , laminin trimers , which are stabilized by disulfide bonds , would mi - grate as intact molecules . However , no new trimeric species that migrated with mobility consistent with that of intact LM - 411 were observed ( data not shown ) . Despite these results , the possibility that some other variant of another laminin α chain is expressed upon knockdown of LM α 5 cannot be ruled out .

Molecular Biology of the Cell and KD4 . 2 cells had distinctly different morphologies than control cells ( Figure 2A ) . KD2 . 4 cells were more dispersed relative to paren - tal and Sc . 5 controls , which tended to form multicellular islands , with KD4 . 2 intermediate in appearance ( Figure 2A ) . Furthermore , al - though all cell lines exhibited a variety of membrane extensions or processes , those in KD2 . 4 tended to be longer , thinner , and more numerous . Cell – cell contacts in control cells were extensive and con - tinuous ; in contrast , those in KD2 . 4 and to some extent KD4 . 2 were often limited to interactions mediated by fine processes ( Figure 2A ) . Time - lapse studies were conducted to determine whether the observed morphological changes accompanying reduction in LM - 511 expression affected cell migration . Control ( parental and Sc . 5 ) MDCK cells and the suppressed cell lines KD2 . 4 and KD4 . 2 were plated at subconfluent density in serum - free medium on collagen - coated chamber slides and their behavior recorded for 800 min ( ∼ 13 h ) . As shown in the selected still images in Figure 2B and in Supplemental Movie S1 , Sc . 5 cells gradually formed small , multicel - lular islands that continued to collectively migrate . By the end of the incubation period , Sc . 5 cells and parental cells ( not shown ) had co - alesced into a small number of islands ( usually one to two per field ) . KD2 . 4 and to a lesser extent KD4 . 2 were usually slow to form islands of adherent cells and tended to remain more disperse , even after 800 min of incubation ( Figure 2B ) . KD2 . 4 cells , in particular , often did not form broad lamellipodia but instead extended long , thin processes resembling filopodia in the direction of migration ( Figure 2B ) . Cell – cell contacts , when present , were generally limited to contact between these thin , extended processes ( Figure 2B ; also see Figure 3 ) . Quantitative assessment of migratory behavior was obtained by tracking individual cells using image analysis software ( Figure 2 , B and C ) . Differences in migration between controls and suppressed cells were not immediately evident by examination of migratory tracks ( Figure 2C , top ) . However , further analysis revealed that KD2 . 4 and KD4 . 2 had significantly reduced levels of directionality evident in windrose plots and calculated measures of directionality ( Figure 2C , bottom , and D ) . Loss of directional migration was even more apparent in wounded cultures . Confluent Sc . 5 and KD2 . 4 cells were wounded with a pi - pette tip and advancement of the edge followed for 200 min by time - lapse microscopy . Under these conditions , the KD2 . 4 wound edge migrated only about one - third as far as the Sc . 5 control ( Figure 2E , yellow arrows ) . Cell migration tracks and windrose plots indicated that control cells at the wound edge exhibited highly di - rectional migration toward the wound , whereas the directionality of KD2 . 4 , and to a lesser extent KD4 . 2 , was significantly reduced ( Figure 2 , F and G ; and data not shown ) . Cells located a few cell lay - ers interior from the wound edge also exhibited aberrant directional migration ( Supplemental Figure S1 ) . Overall , analysis of cells expressing reduced amounts of LM - 511 indicates that both individual and confluent cells responding to a wound lack the ability to efficiently migrate in a particular direction relative to controls . Migration itself is not , however , impaired ; sup - pressed cells sometimes moved greater distances and at higher ve - locities than controls ( Supplemental Information , Figure S1 ) . Suppression of LM - 511 prevents formation of stable cell – cell contacts As mentioned previously , adhesions between cells in KD2 . 4 often did not coalesce into contiguous zones of cell – cell contact but re - mained limited to puncta ( Figure 2A ) . In time - lapse studies of sub - confluent cultures , most initial cell – cell contacts between control cells ( Sc . 5 and parental ) matured into permanent adhesive interac - tions as islands formed . In contrast , many cell – cell contacts in KD2 . 4 failed to mature and were lost as cells involved in the contact moved away from each other . This was apparent when individual initial contacts were tracked over the entire incubation period ( Figure 3A , arrows ) . In Sc . 5 and parental cells , nearly 80 % of con - tacts remained stable during the time of observation . For KD2 . 4 , this number was < 40 % , and with KD4 . 2 contact stability declined to ∼ 70 % ( Figure 3B ) . These results indicated that either the contacts between sup - pressed cells were abnormal or contacts did not mature because cells quickly moved away from each other . To shed light on this point , the stability of cell – cell contacts was measured by hanging - drop assay ( Ehrlich et al . , 2002 ; Qin et al . , 2005 ) . When examined in this way , the area of KD2 . 4 aggregates was significantly less than that of Sc . 5 , consistent with formation of weaker cell – cell adhesions in the suppressed line ( Figure 3C ) . The supposition that cell – cell contacts in laminin α 5 – suppressed cells were abnormal was also supported by immunofluorescence of E - cadherin in confluent cul - tures . In Sc . 5 , staining was confined mainly to the lateral edges of the cell ( Figure 3D ) . In KD2 . 4 and to a lesser extent KD4 . 2 , cell bor - ders as demarcated by E - cadherin staining were diffuse , and exten - sive punctate staining was visible in the cytoplasm ( Figure 3D ) . In summary , observations in migrating cells , suspended aggre - gates , and confluent cultures suggest that knockdown of LM - 511 affects the intrinsic integrity and stability of cell – cell adhesions . Directional migration and cell – cell contact stability are rescued by LM - 511 – enriched matrices If reduction in LM - 511 synthesis and deposition in suppressed cell lines is responsible for defects in directional migration and cell – cell contact stability , then replacement of LM - 511 should restore the normal phenotype . To determine this , a rescue experiment was con - ducted using a preformed matrix . Normal MDCK cells were grown to confluence on collagen , and the cells were removed by treatment with ammonium hydroxide . Because LM - 332 is not expressed in confluent cultures ( Mak et al . , 2006 ; Moyano et al . , 2010 ) , the re - sidual matrix left after cell extraction was enriched in LM - 511 . When KD2 . 4 cells were plated on preformed matrix ( KD2 . 4 plus extracel - lular matrix [ ECM ] ) , cell – cell contact stability , as well as contiguous island formation , was partially restored in comparison to the Sc . 5 control and KD2 . 4 plated on collagen alone ( Figure 4 , A and B , and Supplemental Movie S2 ) . Furthermore , directional migration deter - mined by windrose plots and directionality index was nearly normal ( Figure 4 , C and D ) . Overall , these observations indicate that the two major pheno - typic differences between control and suppressed cell lines in direc - tional migration and cell – cell contact stability are rescued by a pre - formed LM - 511 matrix , which is consistent with the idea that LM - 511 is mechanistically involved in these cell behaviors . Regulation of the polarization machinery is abnormal in cells expressing reduced amounts of LM - 511 Sustained migratory polarity depends on localized activation of Cdc42 , accompanied by oriented assembly of polarity complexes , the microtubule cytoskeleton and Golgi complex , and the branched actin network that forms the core of the lamellipodium ( Etienne - Manneville and Hall , 2001 , 2003 ; Etienne - Manneville et al . , 2005 ; Nelson , 2009 ; Petrie et al . , 2009 ; Osmani et al . , 2010 ) . To deter - mine whether the polarity - signaling mechanism was disturbed by LM - 511 suppression , the localization and activities of various com - ponents were examined . As shown in Figure 5A , the activity of Cdc42 was significantly increased in KD2 . 4 relative to controls , and Volume 23 January 1 , 2012 LM - 511 in MDCK directional migration | 125 FIGURE 2 : Knockdown of LM α 5 results in loss of directional migration .

Greciano et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell KD2 . 4 ( Figure 5B ) . Phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( PIP 3 ) , which is normally found at the single leading edge of migrat - ing cells , was also enriched in more than one location in KD2 . 4 , as determined by localiza - tion of transiently expressed green fluores - cent protein ( GFP ) – PH - Akt ( Figure 5C ) , and phosphorylation of Akt , which is activated by PIP 3 binding , was increased in KD2 . 4 ( al - though not in KD4 . 2 ) relative to controls ( Figure 5D ; Nelson , 2009 ; Petrie et al . , 2009 ) . aPKC ζ , a component of the Par polarity com - plex ( Shin et al . , 2007 ; Nelson , 2009 ) , was , like PIP 3 and cortactin , localized to more than one location on the cell membrane in KD2 . 4 in a diffuse distribution relative to Sc . 5 and exhibited abnormally high activity ( Figure 5 , E and F ) . Finally , in wounded monolayers the orientation of the Golgi complex toward the wound edge , which reflects both polarized assembly of microtubules and membrane trafficking , was inverted in KD2 . 4 in compari - son to Sc . 5 ( Figure 5 , G and H ; Etienne - Manneville and Hall , 2001 ) . In addition , wounded monolayers of KD2 . 4 cells , in a similar manner to subconfluent cultures , showed cortactin and aPKC ζ in multiple plasma membrane locations per cell com - pared with Sc . 5 ( Supplemental Figure S2 ) . When these observations are considered together , it seems evident that suppression of LM - 511 has effects not only on the migra - tory behavior of cells , but also on the intrin - sic signaling machinery that determines the stable front – rear axis required for sustained directionality . LM - 511 and LM - 332 and their integrin receptors α 3 β 1 and α 6 β 4 are spatially segregated in migrating cells Because directional migration is determined by polarization of the intrinsic signaling ma - chinery , we hypothesized that the distribu - tion of laminins and their integrin receptors would be similarly polarized . To prove this , the relative localization of both LM - 511 and LM - 332 was assessed by confocal immuno - fluorescence in migrating cells . It is striking that in control cells ( Sc . 5 ) , LM - 332 was en - riched in the leading edge of subconfluent cells , whereas LM - 511 was mainly restricted to an area immediately behind LM - 332 ( Figure 6A ) . In KD2 . 4 , the distribution of staining was much different , as expected , and did not show a similarly segregated pat - tern . Note that the putative staining of LM - 511 in KD2 . 4 predomi - nantly reflects secreted β 1 and γ 1 subunits , which the polyclonal antibody used in this experiment detects ( Figure 1 , J and K ) ; no monospecific antibody against canine LM α 5 is available . LM - 511 and LM - 332 are ligands for both α 3 β 1 and α 6 β 4 integ - rins , which are expressed in MDCK cells ( DiPersio et al . , 2000 ; Nishiuchi et al . , 2003 , 2006 ; Stipp , 2010 ) . As an initial assessment of also trended higher in KD4 . 2 . The activity of Rac1 ( but not of RhoA ) was also increased , although it did not statistically differ from con - trols ( Figure 5A ) .

Volume 23 January 1 , 2012 LM - 511 in MDCK directional migration | 127 parental cells by shRNA ( Figure 7A ) and the migratory behavior of the affected cell lines examined by time - lapse microscopy . It is surprising that cells in which integrin α 3 ex - pression was suppressed ( Itg α 3 - KD ) exhib - ited a migratory phenotype resembling that of cells with suppressed laminin α 5 expres - sion ( Figure 7B ) . In contrast , suppression of integrin α 6 ( Itg α 6 - KD ) had no apparent ef - fect on migratory behavior . Both calculated directional migration ( Figure 7 , B and C ) and the stability of cell – cell contacts ( Figure 7D ) were significantly reduced in Itg α 3 - KD rela - tive to control cells and Itg α 6 - KD , suggest - ing that α 3 β 1 plays an important role in these processes . As a whole , these results indicate that integrin α 3 β 1 is essential for directional migration of MDCK cells , pre - sumably through its interactions with one or more of the laminins synthesized by migrat - ing cells . Reduction of laminin α 3 expression in addition to that of laminin α 5 restores a normal migratory phenotype and stable cell – cell adhesions Because subconfluent MDCK cells express both LM - 511 and LM - 332 , it seemed possi - ble that the loss of directional migration and cell – cell contact stability in KD2 . 4 was a consequence of increased relative expres - sion of LM - 332 in the context of reduced LM - 511 expression . To test this , KD2 . 4 cells were transiently transfected with small inter - fering RNA ( siRNA ) duplexes targeted to either luciferase ( Luc ) or laminin α 3 ( α 3KD ) . As shown in Figure 8A , duplexes targeting laminin α 3 effectively suppressed mRNA levels in both Sc . 5 and KD2 . 4 compared with the luciferase control . Although KD2 . 4 - Luc exhibited higher levels of laminin α 3 expression than Sc . 5 - Luc , the degree of suppression by laminin α 3 siRNA was similar in both cell lines . When mRNA expression ratios were calculated , the double knockdown ( KD2 . 4 - α 3KD ) had a ratio closer to the Sc . 5 - Luc control than the KD2 . 4 - Luc ( Figure 8A ) . Similarly , the ratio of deposited laminin α 3 to α 5 protein was closer to that of controls in the double knockdown ( Figure 8B ) . Dramati - cally , when migratory behavior was examined , knockdown of lami - nin α 3 in KD2 . 4 restored directionality ( Figure 8 , C – E , and Supple - mental Movie S3 ) , the stability of cell – cell contacts ( Figure 8F ) , and Golgi orientation ( Figure 8 , G and H ) . Apparently , as this experiment demonstrated , expression of different laminins in a particular ratio is more important in determining directional migration than the abso - lute level of expression . DISCUSSION In this study we demonstrate a novel function of LM - 511 in epithelial cell migration . When LM - 511 production is suppressed , MDCK cells exhibit reduced directional migration and cell – cell adhesion stability . The former appears to be due at least in part to disruption of intrinsic cellular mechanisms that determine front – rear polarity . integrin α 3 β 1 and α 6 β 4 roles in the migratory behavior of MDCK cells , integrin subunits α 6 and β 1 were localized in Sc . 5 and KD2 . 4 cells by immunofluorescence . Integrin β 1 served as a surrogate for α 3 because no appropriate anti - canine α 3 antibody was available . As shown in Figure 6B , β 1 staining was enriched in the leading edge of subconfluent or wound - edge Sc . 5 cells , with a concentration of α 6 staining just behind that of β 1 staining . In contrast , the staining pattern of the two integrins in KD2 . 4 in the cell periphery was much less distinct , with concentrated α 6 staining sometimes reaching the cell edge ( Figure 6B , arrows ) . Taken together , these results are consistent with the idea that a polarized spatial distribution of LM - 511 and LM - 332 may form a haptotactic gradient recognized by α 3 β 1 and α 6 β 4 integrins that , in turn , promotes directional cell migration . Integrin α 3 plays a role in MDCK cell directional migration To examine more directly individual functions of the two laminin - binding integrins α 3 and α 6 , integrin expression was suppressed in FIGURE 4 : LM - 511 – enriched preformed ECM rescues directional migration and cell – cell contact stability in LM α 5 - suppressed cells .

Scale bar , 10 μm . pressing laminin α 3 in cells already expressing reduced quantities of laminin α 5 . To our knowledge , our results are the first description of a laminin function dependent on the cooperation of different en - dogenous isoforms . Directional migration of cells depends on establishment of a front – rear axis ( Iden and Collard , 2008 ; Nelson , 2009 ; Petrie et al . , 2009 ) . The polarization process is initiated by localized activation of Cdc42 on the plasma membrane in response to a spatial cue , fol - lowed by assembly of the Par3 / Par6 / aPKC polarity complex , gen - eration of signals leading to the formation of a lamellipodium , and orientation of microtubules , Golgi , and the membrane trafficking apparatus in the direction of migration ( Etienne - Manneville and Hall , 2001 ; Etienne - Manneville et al . , 2005 ; Iden and Collard , 2008 ; Nelson , 2009 ; Petrie et al . , 2009 ; Osmani et al . , 2010 ) . In MDCK cells synthesizing reduced amounts of LM - 511 , the activities of Cdc42 , aPKC ζ , and Akt are elevated relative to controls , and mark - ers of the cell front including aPKC ζ , cortactin , and PIP 3 are abnor - mally localized to more than one area of the plasma membrane . Furthermore , these cells are unable to orient the Golgi complex in the direction of a wound ( Figure 5 , G and H ) . Taken together , these observations suggest that affected cells are unable to identify a dis - tinct spatial cue and attempt to ectopically assemble multiple lamel - lipodia , resulting in increased activities of polarity factors . Ultimately , the cells are unable to establish a single front – rear axis and sustain migration in a particular direction . In our experiments , the lack of directional migration was ob - served both in subconfluent cultures and wounded , confluent cul - tures . In both instances the precise nature of the spatial cues deter - mining migratory direction is obscure . Experiments were conducted on collagen I – coated substrata in hormone - supplemented , serum - free medium to eliminate uncontrolled contributions from serum adhesion and growth factors . Hence directional input is likely gen - erated endogenously in a kind of symmetry - breaking event ( Li , 2009 ) . On the basis of our observations , we hypothesize that this symmetry - breaking event may be the local deposition of LM - 332 to the free edge of a wounded monolayer that , prior to wounding , was Most significantly , the aberrant phenotype exhibited by cells synthe - sizing reduced amounts of LM - 511 is rescued not only by plating cells on preformed matrices enriched in LM - 511 , but also by sup - 130 | P . G . Greciano et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell migrating cell encounters another cell , Necl - 5 facilitates formation of nectin - dependent cell – cell contacts , leading subsequently to more stable E - cadherin – based adhesions ( Takai et al . , 2008 ) . If sup - pression of LM - 511 causes dysregulation of Necl - 5 , then both direc - tional migration and formation of stable cell – cell adhesions might be affected . It may also be significant in the context of our studies that disruption of afadin , a nectin - and actin - binding protein , has been reported to cause abnormal deposition of laminin and mislo - calization of laminin receptors ( Komura et al . , 2008 ) . The two laminins discussed here , LM - 511 and LM - 332 , are struc - turally distinct ( Miner and Yurchenco , 2004 ; Yurchenco , 2011 ) . LM - 511 is a prototypical laminin capable of network formation through interactions of its three LN or polymerization domains ( Yurchenco , 2011 ) . LM - 332 , on the other hand , has truncated sub - units , with the predominant form found in MDCK cells lacking two of the three LN domains . Given that our results suggest possible coop - eration between laminin isoforms , it is tempting to speculate that truncated laminin isoforms such as LM - 332 act by disrupting the LM - 511 network and thereby modulating laminin signaling to the cell . Recent model experiments conducted with purified laminins and visualized by atomic force microscopy are consistent with this inter - pretation ( Chiang et al . , 2011 ) . As discussed in Results , we cannot completely rule out the assembly and secretion of alternative lami - nin trimers when expression of LM α 5 is suppressed , most notably LM - 311 . However , because LM - 311 would also contain the trun - cated α 3 subunit and therefore be incapable of network formation , its presence together with LM - 332 would not invalidate our overall proposal . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture Stock cultures of MDCK cells ( type II , Heidelberg isolate , passages 7 – 35 ) , cultured as described previously ( Matlin et al . , 1981 ) , were adapted to minimal essential medium ( MEM ; Invitrogen , Carlsbad , adherent to a matrix enriched in LM - 511 but containing no LM - 332 ( Mak et al . , 2006 ; Moyano et al . , 2010 ) . Deposition of LM - 332 cre - ates a haptotactic gradient that is then reflected in the distribution of integrins ( Figure 6 ) and is then interpreted by the cell as a direc - tional migratory signal ( deHart et al . , 2003 ; Sehgal et al . , 2006 ; Kligys et al . , 2007 ; Hamill et al . , 2009 ) . Disruption of this gradient by either suppression of LM - 511 or knockdown of integrin α 3 leads to loss of directional migration ( Figure 7 , B and C ) . These results are largely consistent with the observations of others in keratinocytes ( Goldfinger et al . , 1999 ; Hintermann et al . , 2001 ; deHart et al . , 2003 ; Choma et al . , 2004 ; Sehgal et al . , 2006 ; Margadant et al . , 2009 ; Wen et al . , 2010 ) , although in those studies only LM - 332 was examined . The most dramatic observation supporting our hypothesis is that reduction of both laminin α 5 and laminin α 3 expression rescues the phenotype exhibited by laminin α 5 knockdown alone . If differential distribution and quantitative balance of laminin α 5 - and laminin α 3 - containing laminins is required to set up a haptotactic gradient , then it makes sense that suppression of laminin α 3 in the context of lami - nin α 5 reduction , which restores the ratio of expression to a more normal value ( Figure 8 , A and B ) , might provide the cell with suffi - cient spatial information to determine the front – rear axis . In addition to its effect on directional migration , suppression of LM - 511 also destabilizes cell – cell adhesion . In suppressed cells , na - scent adhesions often do not coalesce into a continuous contact zone during migration and are unstable when measured in a hang - ing - drop assay ( Figure 3 , A – C ) . In confluent cultures , cell – cell adhe - sion in suppressed cells also appears abnormal , with significant amounts of intracellular E - cadherin in vesicles ( Figure 3D ) . How di - rectional migration and cell – cell adhesion are linked is unclear . One possible mechanism may involve the nectin family of adhesion mol - ecules ( Takai et al . , 2008 ; Brakeman et al . , 2009 ; Kitt and Nelson , 2011 ) . In migrating cells , the nectin - like molecule Necl - 5 is believed to participate in the development of front – rear polarity through cross - talk between growth factor receptors and integrins .

Collard ( Netherlands Cancer Institute , Amsterdam , Netherlands ) . The plas - mid coding for the GFP - PH - Akt fusion protein ( Varnai and Balla , 1998 ) , a kind gift from Tamás Balla ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) , was transiently transfected using the AMAXA sys - tem ( VCA - 1005 ; Lonza AG , Cologne , Germany ) with the program L - 005 . Generation of laminin and integrin knockdowns Target sequences to knock down LM α 5 ( KD2 : GCAAGUACG - UGGAUCUCAA ; KD4 : GAGAGGAUCAACGUGUUCA ) or LM α 3 ( GGAACCGCAACUUUGGAAA ) synthesis were chosen using algo - rithms at the si DESIGN Center ( www . dharmacon . com / designcenter ) and the Whitehead Institute ( siRNA - help @ wi . mit . edu ) . Oligonucle - otides encoding the corresponding shRNA sequences for LM α 5 and a scrambled sequence ( GGAGAGUUCAUCGUAAGCA ) were cloned into the pSUPER . retro . puro vector ( Oligoengine , Seattle , WA ) . Retroviruses were generated by transfecting 24 μg of each vector and 2 . 4 μg of pVSV - G into the Phoenix gag - pol packaging cell line ( American Type Culture Collection , Manassas , VA ) using Li - pofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) as described ( Schuck et al . , 2004 ) . MDCK cells plated the day before at 2 . 5 × 10 4 cells / cm 2 in 35 - mm dishes were infected with 1 ml of filtered , virus - containing media supplemented with 4 μg / ml polybrene ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and rein - fected the next day . Selection of infected cells was done in the pres - ence of 2 μg / ml puromycin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . For clonal selection , cells were plated at 10 cells / cm 2 , and individual colonies isolated and expanded . To transiently knock down the synthesis of LM α 3 , cells were transfected with siRNAs against the LM α 3 subunit , or luciferase ( GUGCGUUGCUAGUACCAAC ) as control , as described . For the generation of the integrin α 3 and α 6 knock down , cell lines were generated as described before using the corresponding shRNA sequences cloned in the pRVHpuro vector ( Myllymaki et al . , 2011 ) . qPCR and standard RT - PCR Expression of the α 5 and α 3 subunits of LM - 511 and LM - 332 , re - spectively , was determined as described before ( Moyano et al . , 2010 ) using the canine primers Cf _ LAMA5 _ 1 _ SG and Cf _ LAMA3 _ 1 _ SG QuantiTect Primer Assay ( QT01450638 and QT01465975 , re - spectively ; Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) . To determine α 4 expression , the canine primer Cf _ LAMA4 _ 1 _ SG ( QT00903308 ; Qiagen ) was used in standard RT - PCR using the same program as before . Preparation of endogenous LM - 511 – enriched extracellular matrix Parental MDCK cells were plated at a density of 7 . 5 × 10 4 cells / cm 2 on collagen - coated surfaces for 4 d to deposit an ECM enriched in LM - 511 . Cells were then washed with PBS− three times and once with double - distilled H 2 O , and the monolayer was removed by incubating ∼ 10 min in 20 mM NH 4 OH at room temperature , followed by exten - sive washes with PBS− . All solutions were supplemented with 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride ( PMSF ) and protease inhibitor cock - tail ( PIC ; Roche Applied Science , Indianapolis , IN ) . Finally , the ECM was washed with PBS + three times for 5 min before plating cells . Analysis of protein synthesis and deposition by metabolic labeling For biosynthesis analysis , cells were pulse labeled for 30 min with [ 35 S ] Met / Cys as previously described ( Moyano et al . , 2010 ) . Protein was extracted with RIPA buffer ( 10 mM Tris - Cl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % [ wt / vol ] IGEPAL CA - 630 , 0 . 5 % [ wt / vol ] SDS , 1 % [ wt / vol ] sodium deoxycholate ) with 1 mM PMSF , PIC , and phosphatase in - hibitor cocktail ( PhIC ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , and LM - 511 and LM - 332 were immunoprecipitated with either anti – LM - 111 or 8LN5 pAbs , respec - tively ( Table 1 ) . Radiolabeled proteins were resolved by SDS – PAGE ( see later discussion ) and detected by autoradiography . For the analysis of ECM protein deposition , 4 × 10 4 cells / cm 2 were plated on collagen in ExCell , pulsed with [ 35 S ] Met / Cys for 40 min , and then chased for 3 h in ExCell supplemented with 15 μg / ml of unlabeled Met / Cys . The ECM was prepared as described and then extracted in 10 mM Tris - Cl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , and 1 % ( wt / vol ) SDS with 1 mM PMSF , PIC / PhIC , and 100 μM idoacetamide ( IAA ) . Samples were diluted 1 : 1 ( vol / vol ) in 10 mM Tris - Cl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 2 % ( wt / vol ) IGEPAL CA - 630 , 2 % ( wt / vol ) sodium de - oxycholate with 1 mM PMSF , PIC / PhIC , and 100 μM IAA . Radiola - beled LM - 511 or LM - 332 was then immunoprecipitated and ana - lyzed by SDS – PAGE and autoradiography . Immunoprecipitation , small RhoGTPase pull - down assays , and Western blotting For immunoprecipitation , equal amounts of protein extracted in RIPA buffer , determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay ( Thermo Scientific , Rockford , IL ) , were incubated overnight at 4°C with the appropriate concentration of antibody . Immune complexes were captured with 60 μl of 1 : 1 ( vol / vol ) slurry of protein A – Trisacryl ( 20338 ; Thermo Scientific ) for 2 h at 4°C and washed three times with RIPA buffer and once with 10 mM Tris - Cl , pH 8 . 6 . Bound pro - teins were solubilized in 2 × Laemmli buffer with 20 mM dithiothre - itol ( DTT ) , heated at 95°C for 3 min , and alkylated with IAA before SDS – PAGE . Cdc42 and Rac1 pull - down assays were performed as described previously ( Sander et al . , 1999 ) . Briefly , protein was extracted in glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) – Fish buffer ( 10 % [ wt / vol ] glycerol , 50 mM Tris - Cl , pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 % [ vol / vol ] IGEPAL CA - 630 , 2 mM MgCl 2 ) with 1 mM PMSF and PIC / PhIC and incubated with 60 μl of 1 : 1 ( vol / vol ) slurry of GST - PAK - Crib glutathione agarose beads for 45 min at 4°C . The beads were then washed three times with GST - Fish buffer , and proteins were solubilized in 2 × Laemmli buffer with 20 mM DTT , and heated at 95°C for 3 min . For Rho pull - down assays , Rhotekin - RBD - agarose beads ( 14 - 383 ; Millipore , Billerica , MA ) were used following the manufacturer’s instructions . For Western blotting , cells were washed twice with PBS− and extracted in RIPA buffer supplemented with 1 mM PMSF and PIC / PhIC . Samples were resolved by SDS – PAGE and analyzed by West - ern blotting as described previously ( Moyano et al . , 2010 ) . 132 | P . G . Greciano et al .

The number of events in which cells within a field persistently migrated at a particular angle , divided in 10º sec - tors , was represented as a circular histogram or windrose plot . To quantify the specificity of persistent migration as a function of circu - lar distribution , the Rayleigh statistical test for the vectorial data cor - responding to each field was applied , and the p value was calcu - lated ( see later discussion ) . To quantify the stability of nascent cell – cell contacts , individual single cells within fields were manually tracked and initial cell – cell contacts scored for the ability to either remain adherent ( stable con - tact ) or detach ( broken contact ) over the length of the time - lapse analysis . Raw time - lapse files were exported as QuickTime movies using the Sorenson codec set at 8 frames / s using ImageJ and compiled using iMovie’11 ( Apple , Cupertino , CA ) . Wound - healing assays Cells plated at 2 . 5 × 10 5 cells / cm 2 on collagen - coated coverslips or chamber slides were grown to confluency in ExCell . Monolayers were then wounded with either a pipette tip or a razor blade and washed twice with PBS + . The cultures were then incubated in ExCell and recorded using time - lapse videomicroscopy . For immunofluo - rescence , cells were fixed and stained 12 h after wounding . Hanging - drop assays Hanging - drop assays of cell – cell adhesion stability were conducted essentially as described ( Ehrlich et al . , 2002 ) . Trypsinized cells were suspended at a final density of 5 × 10 5 cells / ml in ExCell , and 20 μl of each cell suspension was incubated as a hanging drop from the lid of 60 - mm dishes filled with PBS− . After 24 h , cell aggregates were collected , triturated by pipetting up and down 15 times with a P20 Pipetman , transferred to a Neubauer chamber , and photo - graphed . Cell area of the aggregates was measured using ImageJ . Statistical analysis Statistical significance was determined by one - way analysis of vari - ance with the Student’s t Newman – Keuls post hoc test for multiple Immunofluorescence Cells grown on collagen - coated coverslips were washed twice with PBS + , fixed with 3 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in PBS + for 30 min at room temperature , and then washed three times with PBS− . Unre - acted PFA was quenched with 0 . 1 % ( wt / vol ) NaBH 4 in PBS− for 15 min , followed by three washes with PBS− . In most cases , cells were permeabilized with cold 0 . 1 % ( wt / vol ) Triton X - 100 in PBS− for 4 min and washed twice with PBS− . Samples were blocked with 10 % ( vol / vol ) goat serum or 0 . 2 % ( wt / vol ) fish skin gelatin in PBS− ( block - ing solution ) for 30 min at room temperature . Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and incubated for 1 h at room temperature . Samples were then washed with blocking solution and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa fluoro - chromes ( Invitrogen ) for 30 min at room temperature . After washing , coverslips were mounted with Mowiol - based mounting . Transwell permeable supports ( 3412 ; Corning Life Sciences , Lowell , MA ) were fixed and stained for immunofluorescence as described ( Moyano et al . , 2010 ) .
