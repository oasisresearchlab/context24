V . 2019 Abstract Results of numerous studies indicate that metacognition plays a significant role in students’ design education . Despite the growing number of studies on the role of metacognition , the nature of metacognitive processing in design education and how metacognitive strate - gies contribute to students’ design are not well understood . Thus , the main purpose of this inquiry was to employ rich qualitative data to construct a detailed conceptual model of metacognitive processes in students’ design - thinking and design - making . This study dem - onstrates that metacognitive thinking plays an essential role in design idea generation and development and that it is an important part of the creative process in design . Moreover , the resulting model illustrates how components of metacognition interact and can provide insights to educators seeking to enhance the design process and its outcomes for learners . Keywords Metacognitive thinking process · Reflective learning · Design studio education · Architectural learning Introduction to design thinking and design making The goal of this study was to employ rich qualitative data to construct and validate a detailed conceptual model of metacognitive processes in architectural students’ design - thinking and design - making . Architectural design is a multidimensional process and requires skills such as analytic reasoning , intuition , and creative expression ( Powers 2017 ) . Metacognition , which has been defined as thinking about thinking ( Flavell 1976 ; Lawanto et al . 2013 ) , is the main focus of this paper and one of the dimensions of architecture edu - cation . Researchers have identified metacognitive thinking as a factor that can greatly influence design students’ performance ( Desoete and Ozsoy 2009 ) . For example , Stern - berg and Williams ( 1996 ) draw a direct relation between metacognitive thinking and crea - tive thinking by stating that designers can enhance their creative thinking by focusing on * Shabnam Kavousi shabnamk @ vt . edu 1 Virginia Tech , 121 Burrus Hall ( 0190 ) , Blacksburg , VA 24061 , USA 2 Virginia Tech , 120 F Burruss Hall ( 0190 ) , Blacksburg , VA 24061 , USA 3 University of Maryland , 3304 Benjamin Building , College Park , MD 20742 , USA 710 S . Kavousi et al . 1 3 metacognition . Moreover , according to Pesut ( 1984 ) , metacognition can provide students with an understanding of their creative thought process and allow them to control this pro - cess . He describes creative thinking as “a synthetic metacognitive process—of generating novel and useful associations , attributes , elements , images , abstract relations or sets of operations—that better solves a problem , a plan , or results in a pattern , structure , or prod - uct not clearly present before” ( p . 15 ) . The open - ended nature of design can make its learning confusing and frustrating , espe - cially for design students , which , in turn , can reduce their motivation and willingness to engage ( Powers 2017 ) . Research has shown that metacognition can help students over - come this problem and enhance their learning potential ( Dunlosky and Metcalfe 2009 ) . For these reasons and because of a lack of comprehensive studies in this area ( McLaren and Stables 2008 ; Rahman and Masrur 2011 ; Tarricone 2011 ) , the present study explores metacognition for design learning using qualitative methodologies . Based on the resulting data , a conceptual model of metacognitive thinking and strategies in the design process is then proposed . To develop this conceptual model , students’ thinking processes as they engaged in various design tasks were recorded , analyzed , and categorized . The resulting model is intended to uncover students’ design - making and design - thinking process and , as such , potentially contribute to improved instruction that can facilitate or augment these processes . Architectural education Demirbas and Demirkan ( 2003 ) concluded that understanding the process of learning is the key to improving the educational system . Dorst ( 1997 ) identified Herbert Simon and Don - ald Schön as the two main figures that shaped design education in the United States , each with their own distinct approach to design education . Specifically , Simon ( 1969 ) supported the rational problem - solving method , whereas Schön ( 1983 ) was the advocate of reflective practices in design education . The rational problem - solving paradigm considers design as a logical and repeatable process in which the problem space , which is to be surveyed in search for a ‘satisficing’ 1 design solution , is systematically explored ( Simon 1969 ) . In con - trast , in the reflective practice paradigm , every problem is regarded as unique and should , therefore , be approached accordingly , rather than using general design processes as sug - gested by the rational paradigm . Thus , for those embracing reflective practices , every prob - lem must be carefully analyzed before any actions are taken ( Schön 1983 ) . Both the pedagogical orientation of the Architecture school where this study took place and the personal beliefs of the researchers are more in line with Schön’s perspec - tive . Similar to Schön , the authors of this manuscript also believe that each design task should be approached as a unique problem and that initiating a more formulaic series of design guidelines will not result in an optimum solution . The very idea of reflective prac - tice ( i . e . , pondering the uniqueness of the problem ) links this pedagogical orientation to the notion of thinking about your thinking ( i . e . , metacognition ) . The pedagogy of the school where this research was conducted is atypical of architecture education in several ways and those differences are reflected in all aspects of students’ learning experience , including the 1 The word “satisficing” is a combination of the words satisfying and suffice ; in terms of design decision - making it refers to a decision that is not the best possible decision but it satisfies the design problem , it is “good enough” ( Simon 1969 ) . 711 Modeling metacognition in design thinking and design making 1 3 learning environment , learning tasks , and student assessment . For example , the environ - ment is physically organized to promote interaction among students in the same studio and among students at varied points in their academic training . Also , the learning tasks are open - ended in format and allow for multiple responses . Students are free to choose the process they will follow in creating their final product and are graded based on that process and the reasoning behind it ( Kavousi and Miller 2014 ) . Metacognition What differentiates humans from animals is conscious awareness or the meta phenomenon . It is important to have a clear understanding of metacognition before identifying how it manifests itself . The concept of metacognition was first introduced by John H . Flavell in his article “Metacognitive Aspects of Problem - Solving” ( 1976 ) . Some professionals also refer to metacognition as the “control center” of the cognitive system that regulates the dynamic processes of cognition involved in learning . Metacognition and its manifestations As mentioned , metacognition is a meta phenomenon , and therefore cannot be measured directly through observation . To overcome this obstacle and develop a systematic way to identify the occurrence of metacognition , many researchers have developed metacognition frameworks that categorize a learner’s physical and mental actions based on their charac - teristics . Similarly , in this study , a theoretical framework was utilized to identify and cat - egorize the instances of metacognitive thinking witnessed in students’ task performance . These instances were to serve as the foundation for the conceptual model of metacognition in the design thinking and design making that resulted . More specifically , the writings of Nelson and Narens ( 1990 ) , Pintrich et al . ( 2000 ) , and Dunlosky and Metcalfe ( 2009 ) informed the theoretical framework that guided this investi - gation . Although differences among these frameworks do exist , all three were informed by the writings of Flavell and entail core processes ( e . g . , reflecting , analyzing , drawing con - clusions , and applying ) that are consistent . It is those processes , organized into three key components and nested with Schön’s ( 1983 ) reflective practice paradigm , that framed the present inquiry : reflective process knowledge , reflective process monitoring , and reflective process control . Specifically , reflective process knowledge ( RPK ) corresponds to what Flavell ( 1979 ) and Pintrich et al . ( 2000 ) would call metacognitive knowledge . RPK refers to individuals’ pon - dering about the cognitive abilities and processing they have at their disposal , as well as what strategies might be effective for them in a given situation ( Flavell 1979 ) . For example , design students use their knowledge of the properties of various material in conjunction with their knowledge of the learning task requirements to select a certain material . Reflective process monitoring ( RPM ) is related to metacognitive experience in Flavell’s framework ( 1979 ) and to what Pintrich and colleagues ( 2000 ) call metacognitive monitor - ing . Nested within Schön’s model ( 1983 ) , RPM refers to learners’ contemplation of judg - ments regarding the status of the cognitive activity . Positioned within architectural design , RPM would be evidenced when a student judges his / her performed actions or decisions regarding solving the design problem . For instance , a student who selects a material or media to work with would evaluate his / her choice after working on it to see whether it was appropriate or not . 712 S . Kavousi et al . 1 3 Finally , reflective process control ( RPC ) , which relates to metacognitive strategy in Flavell’s framework ( 1979 ) and self - regulation and control in Pintrich et al . ’s framework ( 2000 ) , refers to individuals’ thinking about the actions they can initiate to alter the current course of their processing or their motivational state . Consider the design stu - dent who used his knowledge from a previous learning task to select a material ( RPK ) , evaluated the appropriateness of his decision ( RPM ) , and now has decided to change the material ( RPC ) . Metacognition and design Design is a complicated process that is difficult to explain to or model for students in ways that are likely to elicit creative thinking ( Sheppard et al . 2009 ) . Because of its non - linear , recursive nature , architectural design processes have no specific beginning or ending . There are no simple formulae or algorithmic procedures to follow that ensure quality architectural designs . That being said , there are actions that can be taken to assist students in improving their designs ( Demirbas 2001 ) . For instance , the American Insti - tute of Architecture Students ( AIAS ) notes that educators have the ability to improve students’ experiences by using design programs and syllabi that promote the awareness and understanding of the processes that relate to creative thinking ( Fjeld 2005 ) . That is to say , by helping students become ( a ) more aware of and attentive to their thinking processes as they engage in design tasks , ( b ) more goal - driven in their performance , and ( c ) more cognizant of strategies they can call upon as needed , their learning should be enhanced and the outcomes subsequently improved ( Hargrove 2008 ; Jausovec 1994 ) . Further , because design is essentially problem solving applied to a particular form of architectural task , educators should devise instructional activities that facilitate metacogni - tive components within design courses ( Hargrove 2008 ; Ku and Morgan 2006 ) . Especially within architectural design , given the emphasis that is placed on creativity , aesthetics , and functionality , reflecting on one’s thinking and responding strategically as the need arises will become even more essential ( Nickerson 1999 ) . Moreover , to achieve this , researchers believe that teachers and students should be provided with guidelines that promote their thinking and strategic behavior and allow for more effective reflection and regulation . Thus , drawing on theory and research in metacognition , the nature of design , and design education , the current investigation set out to construct a conceptual model of design thinking and design making , building on the words and actions of students engaged in a carefully orchestrated learning task . In the context of this study , design is considered as a process where the reality of a designer is constructed by his / her own actions that are responsive , opportunistic and reflective to the design state ( Dorst and Dijkhuis 1996 ) . This approach to design education is reflected in Goldschmidt’s design cycle of “seeing - as” and “seeing - that” ( 1991 ) and Suwa and Tversky’s conception of the design process as consist - ing of cycles of focus shifts and continuing thoughts ( 1997 ) . In their study , Suwa and Tver - sky ( 1997 ) employed the use of informal analysis to reveal the ways each cycle of focus shifts and continuing thoughts are guided by students’ actions . In this regard , they catego - rized the design thinking process into different cycles ( i . e . , RPK , RPM , and RPC ) , where a focus shift cycle includes a unique aspect of design that could be completed by other cycles , so - called continuing thoughts . Thus , their study views the process of design as a process of metacognition that consists of cycles of focus shifts and continuous thoughts , which are related and defined from a metacognitive perspective . 713 Modeling metacognition in design thinking and design making 1 3 Research methodology Research design The overarching research question that guided this study was “What are the metacogni - tive thinking processes that design students use to engage in a design learning task ? ” In order to address this research question and achieve the goal of constructing and validating a model of design thinking and design making , the researchers drew on three components of metacognition to analyze students’ retrospective and concurrent verbalizations . For this phase of model construction , Charmaz’s ( 2006 ) constructivist grounded theory method provided the basis for the data analysis . In the following section , the research design will be explained through participant selection , the learning task , and the data collection tools that were used . Since the objective of this research was to explore the different realities of students’ metacognition experience , a constructivist paradigm was chosen to guide this study . As mentioned in Creswell and Clark ( 2007 ) , a “bottom - up approach” helps with the develop - ment of patterns prior to theory generation . As the researchers embarked on this study , they had no specific hypotheses to prove or test . Rather , the objective was to explore metacogni - tive thinking processes in design students to be able to better explain differences in learner experiences or expressions of metacognition . Participant selection Because explicit attention to metacognition during high school years is quite limited , college students enrolling in architectural design often have limited metacognitive self - awareness or strategy knowledge ( Matanzo and Harris 1999 ) . Many first - year architec - ture students come from non - design backgrounds with little understanding of the cogni - tive strategies involved in creative performance ( Lawson 1979 ) . Therefore , it was decided that first - year design students from a university in the mid - Atlantic region of the United States would be participants in this study . Specifically , 23 students ( 14 female and 9 male ) engaged in the Foundation Design Lab were the informants in this study . This particu - lar lab had certain advantages for this study of reflective metacognitive processes . First , it is a required course for all first - year students from studies in architecture , industrial design , interior design , and landscape , which added to a diversity of background knowl - edge and experiences among the participants . Second , it lasted two semesters , providing ample opportunity to investigate students’ thinking and performance . Third , the researchers were given license to observe and interact with students while they were engaged in design activities for the complete duration of the two semesters . Ethical approval was provided by the Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) . Learning tasks In this study , two learning tasks , specifically , were incorporated into the curriculum for the design lab . The selection of these learning tasks was based on three major criteria of Goos and Galbraith’s study ( 1996 ) : • The projects had to be relevant to a prior learning task since the first learning task would ask students to reflect on their previous work ; 714 S . Kavousi et al . 1 3 • The projects had to be challenging or inviting enough to require metacognitive action , while simultaneously remaining within the students’ design capabilities . • The learning tasks should contain a combination of open - ended problems that require imagination / thinking and routine exercises . So that a degree of initial success on the latter category ( routine exercises ) will help put students at ease with the former cat - egory ( open - ended problems ) . The main reason for having two learning tasks was to permit the implementation of dif - ferent data collection methods ( retrospective and concurrent verbalization ) , which would contribute to the richness of the information gathered . The first learning task occurred toward the end of the fall semester and focused on the independent thinking and behavior of the students . In contrast , the second learning task , which took place at the beginning of the following spring semester , involved students working in groups . For Learning Task 1 , students were asked to look back at the design exercises they had performed earlier in class , reflect on them , and develop a related exercise . Specifically , each student was asked to : 1 . Review previous work including sketchbooks , models , or images . 2 . Find a common theme running through that work ( e . g . , use of repetition , relation between parts and whole ) . 3 . Develop a learning task that builds on the previous learning tasks ( see Table 1 as an example of how a student developed a design question based on her analysis of the previous learning tasks ) . 4 . Think about how they would perform the tasks differently if they were given the same learning task a second time . Each student conceptualized a learning task and presented his / her solution to the ques - tion posed using 2 - D and 3 - D models . This way , Learning Task 1 provided opportunities for metacognitive thinking in that it required students to reflect on prior learning experi - ences and explore alternative design questions that had not been previously addressed . For Learning Task 2 , students were asked to form dyads . Each pair received a 22 ″ × 30 ″ sheet of 2 - ply Bristol board , which is an uncoated , machine - finished paperboard , used for technical drawing or model making . They were then asked to create a design by apply - ing three changes to the Bristol board , such as folding , cutting , twisting or drawing . The instructions were intentionally short and open - ended to encourage students to engage in conversations with each other in determining what constitutes a change and what changes they may want to attempt ( Fig . 1 ) . The learning task also encouraged students to reflect on the processes they used during the course of the activity , for which they were given 3 h . The comparison of the two learning tasks is shown in Table 2 . Although all students were given the same task directive , there were clear differences in their design thinking and design making , as seen in the products resulting from Learning Task 1 ( Fig . 2 ) and Learn - ing Task 2 ( Fig . 3 ) . Data collection‑verbalization data As noted , the two learning tasks differed in which form of verbalization data was gath - ered from them . For both tasks , verbalization methods were used “as a tool or a virtual window into the mind” of the student ( Dunlosky and Metcalfe 2009 , p . 15 ) .

Retrospective verbalization limits interference with students’ thought processes as they work on the first learning task . In concurrent verbalization , which was used for the second learning task , students were recorded as they verbalized their thoughts or discussed their ideas or how to implement an idea with their teammates . This occurred as they were working on their designs . For this reason , students were asked to work in pairs during the second learning task . The concurrent verbalization method minimizes the time between students’ actions and associated verbalizations . These multiple data collection methods were used to dimin - ish effects of the data collection methods on the students’ thinking and performance and to improve the trustworthiness of the interpretations made . Using a combination of methodo - logical approaches provided the benefit of enhanced triangulation and boosted the trust - worthiness of the data while reducing the potential for researcher bias ( Denzin and Lincoln 2005 ; Merriam 1998 ) . For the first learning task , two videos were recorded . The first video captured students’ actions as they engaged in design thinking and - making ( see Fig . 4 ) . The second video recorded the semi - structured interview between the researcher and the student regarding Fig . 2 Examples of student designed submitted for Learning Task 1 718 S . Kavousi et al . 1 3 Fig . 3 Examples of the designs produced by dyads for Learning Task 2 Fig . 4 Example camera point of view for Learning Task 1 719 Modeling metacognition in design thinking and design making 1 3 their thinking process ( Fig . 5 ) . The videos provided the researchers with students’ points of view and experiences about the learning phenomena . Students were asked to recall and report ( verbally ) what they were thinking while they were working on the learning task while watching the video . They were able to pause the video whenever they felt they needed more time to recall and verbalize what they were doing . In the first learning task , after the retrospective verbalization was completed , students were asked a series of follow - up questions ( Q1 – Q3 ) to complement the description of their thinking process . Since the topic under examination is metacognition , the participants were allowed to naturally discuss their mental processes ( Peirce 2003 ) . Q1 . How did you approach your design task ( strategies used to solve your design problem ) ? Q2 . Did you use any specific strategy that you think was successful ? Q3 . Did you execute your design task differently from what you are used to ? Question 1 intended to gather general information regarding students’ approaches and strategies ; asking the question specifically gave the researchers the opportunity to better differentiate between the approaches that students used . The second question examined stu - dents’ metacognitive awareness regarding their strategies and judgment of the outcomes ( goals and how they can be achieved ) . The third question was asked to identify whether being observed influenced the participants’ normal processes to ensure that the phenomena under study occurred as naturally as possible . For the second learning task , students were asked to think aloud as they worked on the design task with their teammate . They were urged to share whatever came to mind Fig . 5 a Researcher interviews students as they reflect on the design process using a variety of mediums including , b roll , and c 3D models 720 S . Kavousi et al . 1 3 throughout the learning task , as well as the ideas or actions they wanted to communicate to their teammate . All of this concurrent verbalization was recorded on a camera that also captured the students’ actions during Learning Task 2 . Data analysis : development and validation of categories and subcategories There are two types of Verbal Protocol Analysis ( VPA ) , formal and informal . Infor - mal VPA views design as a process where the designer constructs his / her reality through actions that are responsive , opportunistic , and reflective of the design state ( Dorst and Dijkhuis 1996 ) . In formal VPA , design is described in terms of basic problem - solving tax - onomy and the objective is to introduce design methodology outcomes that can be gener - alized . In this study , the informal VPA approach was applied to address the overarching research question of design students’ engagement in metacognitive thinking during learn - ing task performance . Each student’s verbal protocols were encoded and categorized into subclasses of information . Data analysis is a process in which data is sorted , categorized , grouped , and regrouped into meaningful themes ( Rallis and Rossman 2003 ) . In this investigation , a thematic data analysis process was used to understand the data and identify common or recurring themes and patterns . In accordance with this method , categories and defini - tions were developed based on a constant comparison methodology . These categories and definitions were refined through an iterative process up to a point of theoretical sat - uration ( Fig . 6 ) . Grounded theory consists of three main components : concepts , catego - ries , and propositions ( Pandit 1996 ) . For this study , a concept was operationalized as the pairing of action verbs and nouns ( e . g . , draw + sketch ; make + picture ; build + model ) , which was then consolidated into a single action ( e . g . , sketching , drawing , or modeling ) . Fig . 6 Data analysis steps 721 Modeling metacognition in design thinking and design making 1 3 In the first attempt , the initial coding structure consisted of 45 distinct action verbs or nouns ( gerunds ) . In some instances , these action verbs or nouns came directly from stu - dents’ verbalizations . For example , the excerpt below was analyzed to extract the action verb “planning . ” I plan to achieve them [ the projects ] by going back and thinking about each pro - ject , processes and all my ideas . ( Autumn ) In other instances , codes were ascribed by the researchers , based on the actions observed . During the initial coding process , the goal was to develop a definition for each gerund that would describe all the instances categorized under it . After close examina - tion of the emergent codes and their definitions , it was concluded that some of the initial codes were too broad and needed more refinement , while others were overlapping and could be combined . For example , reviewing was originally defined to include all review - ing activities but after further analysis of the data , it was concluded that reviewing pre - vious works , reviewing a friend’s experiments , and reviewing prior knowledge have dif - ferent levels of significance for metacognition . Therefore , the reviewing category was considered too broad and was broken down into three categories . Table 3 provides addi - tional examples of how codes were ( re - ) allocated and ordered in the initial phase . The next step in the process was focus coding ( Charmaz 2006 ) , where similar action verbs were bundled together to form specific categories . For example , since browsing , listening to a professor , experimenting with material , reading the task , sketching , and reviewing previous work all explain students’ understanding of the task and not how to do the task , they were categorized under cognitive processing . Similar to the initial coding stage , codes and their location in the model were con - tinuously evaluated to ensure that the position of the codes in the model is in agreement with their definitions . For example , debugging strategy , strategies used to correct com - prehension and performance errors , was originally a subcategory of reflective process control , which is defined as students making decisions to regulate their learning pro - cess . After further reviewing the statements coded in this category , it was concluded that decision - making was not part of the processes described by students ; therefore , the category was re - labeled as strategy monitoring and was relocated under the reflective process monitoring category . After multiple iterations of categorizing , organizing , and comparing the categories , the thematic coding structure was formed . The validity of this step was established Table 3 Examples of initial coding changes Initial code Revised code Feeling stuck Personal feeling of the task Frustrated Feeling confused Feeling blank Assessing Assessing material Assessing friend’s experiment Assessing own model Reviewing Reviewing previous works Reviewing friend’s experiments Reviewing the previous knowledge 722 S . Kavousi et al . 1 3 through peer examination , during which the researchers discussed their findings and made the necessary changes until a consensus was reached . In the last step , based on the definition of each thematic coding , the researchers clas - sified each code under one of the three main categories of metacognition extracted from the literature review : reflective process knowledge , reflective process monitoring , and reflective process control . Definitions , examples , and interpretations of these three cat - egories and their subcategories are presented in Table 4 . Multiple layers of the reflective subcategories that are shown in the final conceptual model ( see Fig . 7 ) are provided as a means to convey the necessary contextual information regarding each of the codes that were developed in the previous phases of the analysis . For example , inspirational environment by itself does not provide much information regarding the behaviors that are coded under it , but based on the hierarchical information shown in Fig . 7 ( Metacog - nitive Process → Reflective Process Control → Control of Situational Actions → Control of Idea Generation → Inspirational Environment ) it can be seen that instances in which students made a decision to modify their design environment to aid their inspiration are captured under this code . Data validation In qualitative research , the data acquired are subjective and involve human feelings and perceptions ( Morgan 2013 ) . It is important for the researcher to utilize all the available methods and techniques to ensure that the data acquired and analyzed result in findings that are valid and reliable . In making determinations of validity and trustworthiness , consistency between students’ views and the researcher’s interpretation ( i . e . , member checks ) are an important source of evidence ( Koch 2006 ) . Thus , after the data gathered through the verbalization methods were transcribed , the researchers asked the partic - ipants to review the transcripts and verify their accuracy . Additionally , the research - ers had the opportunity to observe the students on multiple occasions during the two semesters . To ensure the trustworthiness of the data , the analysis , and the findings , the researchers used triangulation , member checks , long - term observation , and peer exami - nation . A summary of how each item was utilized is provided in Table 5 . Regarding the transferability of the findings it should be noted that , as Lincoln and Guba ( 1985 ) have mentioned , the main assumption for qualitative research is that the results cannot be generalized outside the research setting . The intention of the research - ers was not to develop a generalized model but rather to develop a model that can pro - vide a deeper understanding of metacognitive thinking in a design environment . Design thinking and design making Understanding how the data were categorized is key to determining how Foundation Design Lab students use metacognitive processes . Figure 7 illustrates the metacogni - tive thinking framework that was developed as a result of this study . In the following sections , each of the categories and subcategories will be described ; excerpts from the acquired data have also been provided . 723 Modeling metacognition in design thinking and design making 1 3 T a b l e 4 D e fi n iti on s a nd e x a m p l e s o f r e fl ec ti v e p r o ce ss kno w l e d g e , r e fl ec ti v e p r o ce ss m on it o r i ng , a nd r e fl ec ti v e p r o ce ss c on t r o l s ub ca t e go r i e s R e fl ec ti v e ca t e go r y Sub c a t e go r y D e fi n iti on s E x a m p l e s I n t e r p r e t a ti on s P r o ce ss kno w l e dg e C ogn iti ve s t r a t e g y k no w l e dg e T h i nk i ng a bou t c ogn iti on a nd c ogn iti v e s t r a t e g i e s “ I t e nd t o s k i m s t u ff [ l ea r n i ng t a s k ] s o i f I r ea d it i n m o r e d e t a il t h e n it b ec o m e s m o r e c l ea r t o m e . ” ( C a t h e r i n e ) C a t h e r i n e ’ s kno w l e dg e r e g a r d i ng h e r c ogn iti v e p r o ce ss i s t o s t a r t w it h s k i mm i ng t h e m a t e - r i a l a nd on ce s h e fi nd s s o m e t h i ng i n t e r e s ti ng s h e r ea d s it m o r e ca r e f u ll y t o und e r s t a nd it .

Design learning mainly happens through try - ing different strategies and consciously or unconsciously monitoring the outcomes of each strategy to identify the successful ones and the conditions for which each strategy is best suited . Cognitive strategy knowledge is the main source of knowledge that students use to do a design task . As students get more experience , their knowledge of how to design Fig . 7 Conceptual map of metacognitive design thinking Table 5 Data validation techniques Member checks To eliminate misinterpretation of the acquired data , students reviewed the tran - scripts and verified its validity Long - term observation Due to her position as the teaching assistant for the class , the researcher was able to observe students for an extended period of time before and after the data collection sessions Peer examination The researchers discussed the approach to collect / analyze the data and to draw conclusions based on the results 726 S . Kavousi et al . 1 3 increases . Self - awareness or students’ ability to understand themselves and their strengths and weaknesses is an important subcategory of RPK . Task awareness is another subcat - egory of RPK , which also significantly influences metacognitive thinking and contains students’ understanding of the learning task and its requirements . These three interrelated subcategories provide learners with the knowledge of how to learn , which influences the learning process that students go through . Cognitive strategy knowledge The collected data indicated that the strategies that students used most frequently to achieve the learning task’s objectives were sketching , reviewing their sketchbook or their roll paper , making sketch models , and reading the learning task . Cognitive strategy knowl - edge is defined as the comprehensive understanding of the cognitive processes and their outcomes . Designers draw on their previous experience to help them select the best strate - gies for a given design situation . Cognitive strategy knowledge relates to task - awareness and self - awareness in that the strategies that students select depend on their understanding of the requirements of the learning task , as well as on their ability to implement those strategies . The excerpt below shows how Noah , based on his understanding of the requirements of the learning task , selected the strategy that he deemed most appropriate ( reviewing his sketchbook instead of sketching ) . Normally I would say 70 % of the time I’ll be sketching , ideas , ideas , maybe a day , two days and three days , sketch , sketch , sketch and then maybe 30 % are working on the project actually . So I have lots of time but this time working since it’s looking back at the stuff , I look back at my sketches that I have been doing…I’ll say for this time looking at my sketchbook [ was my most successful strategy ] . ( Noah ) Another example of how students use the experience from previous projects is shown in the excerpt below , where Hana knew the limitations of using glue because of a previous experience , and selected an alternative strategy . Because this one attached with glue and the relationship depends on glue I tried to not use glue and without these boundaries [ points to the outside of her model ] , I use cotton thread to tie them together and I found , it is not very stable , it can move , there is some movement , so this movement gives me some alignment . So I used this steel to do this . [ pointed out to her steel model ] small cubes to make movement more apparent and I found that this is because it can move sometimes it becomes a line when I hold hand [ she shows with hand gesture ] become like this [ like cube ] . ( Hana ) Self‑awareness Self - awareness , as the term suggests , refers to all the information that learners have about themselves . Through learning tasks , they increase their knowledge of their strengths and weaknesses , as well as some other factors such as the environment , all of which influence their design process . As noted and illustrated in the excerpt that follows , self - awareness influences the strategies students use during the course of their design . In this excerpt , Nicky is aware that she spends a lot of time thinking about various solutions without sketching them and is cognizant of the problems associated with this strategy , causing her to try and use a different approach in this learning task . 727 Modeling metacognition in design thinking and design making 1 3 My problem is that I just sit and stare at a blank sheet of paper and kind of run through ideas in my head instead of sketching it out and seeing what I can come up with , it probably would be better . It is very hard for me to start a project sometimes . ( Nicky ) It is crucial for students to have an accurate understanding of their strengths and weak - nesses . Students can use this information to take advantage of their strengths and work on their weaknesses . Self - awareness also includes students’ knowledge about themselves regarding other factors that could influence their design thinking process . A large number of students indicated that listening to music increases their focus while engaged with their learning tasks . The acquired data indicated that first year students did not have strong or accurate self - awareness due to their lack of experience , which changed as they gain more experience . This is in line with previous research ( Erskine 2009 ) . Task‑awareness Task - awareness or understanding the requirements of the task is an important step in devel - oping a successful design . Students use their previous experiences to analyze the require - ments of the learning task . To be able to better analyze the learning task and its require - ments , a majority of students took notes while the professor was explaining the learning task and also discussed the learning task with each other . An important subcategory of task - awareness is task - value , which is defined as how the learning task aligns with an indi - vidual’s short - term and long - term plans and goals . The excerpt below shows how students get motivated if they believe a learning task will help them reach their personal or profes - sional goals . I see that it is very valuable to be able to analyze my past projects , the success and mistakes , to find a thread between them . It could help me open my eyes and mind more as a designer . ( Bill ) This motivation will also facilitate their mastery of necessary skills and help them to rec - ognize the relevance of what they are learning beyond the specific course . My work is more personal to me than just for the scope of course objectives… Tak - ing it a step further with this process . It is going to help me discover something that’ll help me in this process . It is going to help me discover something that’ll help me in the future . ( Daisy ) …This task is going to help me focus in the design picture rather than just individual projects . It is going to help me realize a trend , how in my projects that I can catch upon and take further with my final project and further stud - ies . ( Daisy ) Because of the importance of task - awareness , students utilized a variety of techniques to improve their understanding and analysis abilities . Reflective process monitoring Reflective process monitoring ( RPM ) , which is defined as the judgments students make about the status of learning , is another major category of metacognitive design thinking . RPM is further divided into situational actions monitoring and personal feeling monitoring subcategories . The acquired data indicated that RPM is the most popular thought process within metacognitive design thinking . The RPM category and its subcategories include 728 S . Kavousi et al . 1 3 students’ judgments about how they are progressing through the learning task and how they are learning from what they are doing that can be useful for their future designs . The outcome of these judgments is used as an input to reflective process control . Situational actions monitoring Situational actions monitoring or judgments of how certain decisions or actions influenced the process of the design is an important part of learning how to design . The knowledge and experience gained through these judgments form students’ knowledge regarding what strategies were successful or unsuccessful . These judgments help students generate and develop ideas by identifying inspirational resources and strategies to overcome obstacles . Idea generation monitoring Idea generation monitoring is defined as Learner’s judgment of sources for design idea generation , either in form of resourcefulness or hindrance . To generate ideas , students look for inspiration , which may come from external sources such as colleagues in the same year of the program and seniors , or internal sources such as previ - ous sketches . Because of the influence of their previous experiences , students use different sources for inspiration , and different strategies to overcome obstacles as they progress in their designs . Foundation Design Lab is designed to facilitate student interactions , which students uti - lize as a source of inspiration . This inspiration may come from the discussions they have with other students or from how other students approached the learning task . The excerpt below is an example of such collaborations between students . Catherine received a sugges - tion from one of her classmates regarding the material she was using for her design . I started to think to do this and Liana said to me maybe trying it in different material might help me and just I have been doing this . ( Catherine ) The instructor is also a source of inspiration for many students . Students take notes as the professor is describing the learning task or ask for the professor’s opinion . I think I wrote down some things that Professor said like , a competition of questions what you should come up with and she said [ Professor ] ? what makes you excited . ( Bill ) Students often walk around the studio or go to other labs in the department to get inspi - ration from the work of other colleagues . Realizing that I thought what everybody else doing . So I walked around and I nor - mally check whenever there is an open path I just stop at a random desk . ( Edward ) These examples are all external sources of inspiration , but there are internal sources such as their previous knowledge and experience that can inspire students . So what I did I checked all my works that I have done and then I thought I did a lot with intersection and plane and this stuff so I took that and kind of wrote down words and these kind of explain what I am doing . ( Marie ) Students’ ability to generate ideas may be hindered for several reasons . Lack of self - esteem is a major contributor to these hindrances where students are afraid to design . Other sources of hindrances can be not fully understanding the task requirements , or not being able to focus because of personal issues or because of distraction from the environment . 729 Modeling metacognition in design thinking and design making 1 3 Some students were too focused on what others in the lab were doing , which negatively impacted their ability to focus on their own ideas . One of the approaches that students used to overcome these hindrances was to ask for help from others . As the excerpts below demonstrate , Catherine is asking for help because of her lack of self - esteem , but Max does so because he does not have the necessary skills . I go over and start to talk to Marie about it and I was like I don’t really know where to go with this one . I know I want to do something but I am not sure how to do it . ( Catherine ) I am always asking one of my friends whenever he has time to finish my mold . Because he had done a lot of projects with rockite so I can get good advice from him . ( Max ) Idea development monitoring After generating an idea , students need to further develop the idea . Idea development monitoring is the metacognitive thinking process students’ use to monitor the development of their idea relative to strategy , time , process , and outcome , consciously or subconsciously . Metacognition can help students improve the quality of the outcome of the idea development through monitoring . Since the first learning task required students to develop a question based on their previous designs , the first step for most of the students was to review their previous designs . However , what they looked for in their previ - ous designs and how they organized their thoughts differed per student . For instance , Linda looked for discoveries in her previous work and organized them based on their outcomes . Recording the qualities and discoveries of each , and hopefully I will see a connection in that . ( Linda ) Nicky analyzed each of her previous designs by developing a schematic sketch and describing the strengths and weaknesses of each of her previous works ( Fig . 8 ) . Personal feeling monitoring Personal feeling monitoring is concerned with learners’ judgments regarding their emo - tional states as they are engaged with the design . Students may have negative , positive , or neutral emotional judgments regarding their performance . The difficulty of the learning task and their confidence in doing the task can influence their emotional state and hence their performance . These judgments may be due to their past performance in similar learn - ing tasks . In the excerpts below , Taylor is excited to start working on the learning task ; Edward , on the other hand , is nervous and has a negative initial view on the learning task . I like this project that we are doing because we kind of make the assignment our self so I also thought having to figure it out to come about the question that you are pre - senting and I can show that like a project . ( Taylor ) Right now I am a bit nervous about this task , but I usually get nervous before starting a new task in the studio . ( Edward ) Students’ confidence or lack of confidence is referred to as self - reliance and is defined as their perception regarding their ability to successfully accomplish the objectives of the learning task , which is demonstrated by the excerpts below . Their perception may nega - tively or positively influence their emotional state . I never think I cannot do it . ( Marie ) 730 S . Kavousi et al . 1 3 How far I am behind…I observe how she [ Marie ] likes to work with planes a lot like different intersecting and it is almost how to define ideas and she has a lots of ques - tion for the projects . I thought I don’t really have that question in my mind . ( Eric ) Reflective process control Reflective process control is a subcategory of metacognitive design thinking that is con - cerned with the decisions students make and the corresponding actions that influence their process of design problem - solving . In other words , the reflective process control category and its subcategories contain student thought processes in which students make decisions to adjust their design learning process . This thought processing category is divided into three main subcategories : control of personal feelings , control of situational action , and control of environment . Fig . 8 Nicky engages in evaluating her ideas 731 Modeling metacognition in design thinking and design making 1 3 Control of personal feelings Students’ decisions regarding how to change or maintain their feelings and emotions towards the learning task are captured in control of personal feeling . Action verbs such as choosing , adjusting , and focusing that relate to student affective and emotional states reflect such decisions . The excerpt below is one example of how students make such decisions . I worked on collage to help relax and inspire me” ( Taylor ) “Now I am listening to the music . Usually I love music because if I listen to beach music it reminds me of beach houses , and trees . I might draw something , What - ever I draw might become something else . I might have questions . It is like what - ever emotional situation that you are in the artwork produced by that emotion . ( Taylor ) Control of situational actions Control of situational actions includes the decisions made by students regarding their design solving process and how to make progress with their design . This subcategory can be further divided into two main sub - categories : control of idea generation and control of idea development . Control of idea generation Control of idea generation is concerned with student actions and decisions such as planning , iterative reading of the task description , and following the professor’s suggestions that help them generate suitable ideas for their design - task . This should not be mistaken for task - awareness where students read the task description to ana - lyze its requirements ; in this category , iterative reading of the task is done as a method to generate ideas . Probably 20 times . I kind of restate it in my head and try to rethink it . ( Kara ) Professors also play an important role in helping students generate their design ideas . As shown in the excerpts below , Edward changed his design ideas after talking to the professor . After talking to the professor I had thoughts of how to improve my cube . She also helped me understand how to improve my judgment , which is something that I’ve had a tough time understanding through the semester . ( Edward ) Finally , Students control their idea generation by changing their inspirational environ - ment . For example , some students decided to walk around the studio to find a source of inspiration . Control of idea development Control of idea development is the second subcategory of control of situational action and is concerned with how to further develop the ideas that were previously generated . Regulating strategies are an important part of idea development that ensures that what one is doing will result in a successful design . The excerpts below show how Ava adjusts her idea development by changing the size of wood she is using , while Catherine achieved this by using a different material . 732 S . Kavousi et al . 1 3 I thought that the first type of wood I used is too thick and if I used another type smaller one , it would better help my project . ( Ava ) I need to do something and one thing that was very helpful to me was that I changed part of my material , I was kind of sticking to cardboard and Bristol and I did find some wood in the shop over there and that really helped . ( Catherine ) Students also used their experiences from previous designs and adjust the strategies that they used to overcome some of the issues they faced and improve their performance . In the excerpts below , Steve and Marie changed their regular idea development strategies to achieve this . …usually I don’t sketch that much but I did sketches because I thought that I had many ideas I want to see them on paper and I want to see which one is the best . ( Steve ) I kind of change my strategy to focus more on model making instead of drawing . ( Marie ) Control of environment Control of environment is defined as actions taken by students before or during the design process to control the physical design environment . Change of environment can signifi - cantly influence students thought processing . Many of the students started their learning task by organizing and cleaning their desks . Cleaning my space , it made me think about like other projects that I want to go back and look at . ( Nicky ) Conceptual model of design thinking and design making The conceptual model that was developed as the result of this study embeds Schön’s reflec - tive practice concept ( 1983 ) into Pintrich et al . ’s framework ( 2000 ) , in which they describe the fundamentals of metacognitive thinking . The resulting framework captures the meta - cognitive thinking process that occurs in reflective design . Figure 7 illustrates how vari - ous categories and subcategories of metacognitive processing relate to each other during students’ design thinking and design making . The size of the balloons in Fig . 7 are an indication of the importance of that category or subcategory in the overall student thought process as they engaged in the design activities that were central to this investigation . The resulting conceptual model is divided into five regions , labeled A to F . The pro - cesses represented in Region A combine the key components of Pintrich et al . ’s metacogni - tive thinking model ( 2000 ) and Schön’s reflective practice concept ( 1983 ) . Regions D , E and F were derived from the data acquired for this research and capture the thought pro - cesses that emerged during the performance of the learning tasks at the core of this inves - tigation . Regions B and C provide contextual information that can help the reader better understand the thought processes that are categorized under them . For example , Prioritiz - ing , which is in Region E , does not provide any insight to the types of behavior that are categorized under it . However , since it has been categorized under Planning ( Region D ) , it can be inferred that in this conceptual model , when students are planning the activities that need to be done , they prioritize some over others . Since Planning is a subcategory of 733 Modeling metacognition in design thinking and design making 1 3 Control of Idea Development ( Region C ) , further information can be inferred that suggests thought processes were taking place in which students made the decision that , to improve the development of their designs , they needed to have a plan and that part of this plan was to prioritize different activities that needed to be done . Subcategories in Region B are loosely based on Pintrich et al . ’s model ( 2000 ) but their definitions were modified to reflect the types of thought processing present in design think - ing . For example , Pintrich et al . ’s ( 2000 ) knowledge subcategories ( i . e . , task , self , and cognitive strategy ) correspond to task - awareness , self - awareness , and cognitive strategy knowledge in our framework . Thought processes like control of situational action , and situ - ational action monitoring depicted in Region B are rather complex and multidimensional processes . For that reason , more detailed subcategories were needed to better explain what is transpiring for each of these broader categories . When compared to the original framework developed by Pintrich et al . ( 2000 ) , it can be seen how the researchers have extended this framework to develop one that is representa - tive of the mental processes occurring in the design learning environment . For example , reflective process control in this conceptual model takes into account the specific decisions that design students make during the course of a learning task . Unlike many other disci - plines , design students go through multiple cycles of idea generation , which consists of generation , development , review , and improvement of an idea . Another area where the researchers significantly extended Pintrich et al . ’s model ( 2000 ) is regarding students’ perception of task difficulty . Learning tasks in design are intention - ally ambiguous and the outcomes are less defined , which is significantly different from learning tasks in other disciplines that have clear instructions and answers that can usu - ally be evaluated as right or wrong . For this reason , design students’ perception of task - difficulty is closely related to their personal feeling ( Efklides 2002 ) , which is why it was categorized under personal feeling of the task , which is a subcategory of personal feeling monitoring . The modified model relates students’ perception of task - difficulty to their emo - tional state , whereas in non - design disciplines , judgments are tied to right or wrong , know - ing or not knowing . This research views students’ perception of task - difficulty and their emotional state as having a bilateral relationship , where their perception of task - difficulty influences their emotional state and vice versa . Learners’ judgments regarding the correctness of their answers are referred to as con - fidence judgments . In design learning tasks , the process of design is most important and there are no right or wrong answers . Hence , in the researchers’ framework , students’ judg - ments regarding their design process are categorized as self and their judgments regarding the product of this process are categorized as outcome , which are subcategories of personal feeling monitoring . Idea generation and idea development ( Group D ) are important concepts within design thinking , which is why a significant number of codes have been dedicated to explaining them . Facilitators have a significant influence on design students’ thinking . To capture this influence , the researchers developed a generation monitoring category divided into fac - tors that help students generate ideas ( facilitators ) and factors that they need to overcome ( inhibitors ) . The conceptual model developed by the researchers accomplishes the following objec - tives : ( a ) It combines existing metacognition models with design pedagogy to create a new model that accounts for the types of thought processes that design students have while working on their learning tasks ; ( b ) It provides detailed information regarding each cat - egory and its subcategories that will help readers better identify the types of thought pro - cesses categorized under each code . 734 S . Kavousi et al . 1 3 Conclusion In this study , researchers developed a new conceptual model of metacognitive thinking and developed the nomenclature for understanding reflective metacognition processes that emerge in design learning . Although the framework was based on the data acquired from a top - ranked architecture school that employs a unique pedagogy ( see Sect . 1 . 1 ) , there is reason to believe that similar processes would be observed among design stu - dents at other institutions . What this conceptual model provides researchers and those engaged in design instruction with , is a blueprint for what novel or thought - provoking learning tasks can stimulate in the minds of students . How the detailed thought pro - cesses represented in the mind might manifest in other domains in which creativity and novel product developments are central , remains a question for future research . Further , to better understand the influence of metacognitive thinking processes over time , future researchers may wish to undertake longitudinal studies that explore how the processes represented in this conceptual model change over time . It is also envisioned that this conceptual model can inform education devoted to design thinking and design making by focusing attention on the underlying mental processes that should give rise to more innovative designs and more capable designers .
