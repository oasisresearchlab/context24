For cells adherent to ﬁbronectin , differential engagement of a 5 b 1 and a V b 3 integrins is used to elicit changes in adhesion complex stability , mechanosensation , matrix assembly , and migration , but the mechanisms responsible for receptor regulation have remained largely obscure . We identify phosphorylation of the membrane - inter - calated proteoglycan syndecan - 4 as an essential switch controlling integrin recycling . Src phosphory - lates syndecan - 4 and , by driving syntenin binding , leads to suppression of Arf6 activity and recycling of a V b 3 to the plasma membrane at the expense of a 5 b 1 . The resultant elevation in a V b 3 engage - ment promotes stabilization of focal adhesions . Conversely , abrogation of syndecan - 4 phosphoryla - tion drives surface expression of a 5 b 1 , destabilizes adhesion complexes , and disrupts cell migration . These data identify the dynamic spatiotemporal regulation of Src - mediated syndecan - 4 phosphory - lation as an essential switch controlling integrin traf - ﬁcking and adhesion dynamics to promote efﬁcient cell migration . INTRODUCTION Haptotactic migration , in which cells are guided by direct inter - actions of adhesion receptors with extracellular matrix ( ECM ) ﬁbers , is fundamental to tissue morphogenesis , homeostasis , and repair and for the pathogenesis of inﬂammatory and neoplastic diseases . Focal adhesions ( FAs ) are sites of cell - ECM integration where topological features of the ECM are inter - preted . FAs contain clusters of integrin receptors and hundreds of cytoskeletal and signaling molecules . These complexes func - tion as both physical links to the contractile cytoskeletal machinery and dynamic signaling nexuses . Crucially , efﬁcient cell migration requires the precise spatial and temporal regula - tion of FA turnover and stabilization ( Geiger et al . , 2001 ; Ridley et al . , 2003 ) . Engagement of different integrin heterodimers by the same ECM ligand elicits remarkably different cellular responses ( Morgan et al . , 2009 ) . The ﬁbronectin - binding integrins a 5 b 1 and a V b 3 exhibit distinct biomechanical , mechanoresponsive , and signaling properties that directly inﬂuence the dynamic inter - action with the ECM and cell migration ( Danen et al . , 2002 , 2005 ; Hu et al . , 2007 ; Puklin - Faucher and Sheetz , 2009 ; Roca - Cusachs et al . , 2009 ) . It follows that , during cell migration in vivo , heterodimer - speciﬁc integrin localization at the cell - ECM inter - face must be tightly regulated . Intracellular trafﬁcking pathways spatially and temporally segregate engagement of , and signaling from , speciﬁc integrin heterodimers , and accumulating evidence suggests that integrin recycling plays a key role in cell migration and disease progression ( Caswell et al . , 2009 ; Roberts et al . , 2001 ; White et al . , 2007 ) . Thus , elucidating the precise mecha - nisms that control heterodimer - speciﬁc trafﬁcking of integrins , and how this process modulates FA dynamics , is fundamental to understanding how cell migration is coordinated . Syndecans are transmembrane heparan sulfate proteogly - cans that act as receptors for ECM molecules and coreceptors for growth factors , cytokines , and morphogens ( Alexopoulou et al . , 2007 ; Morgan et al . , 2007 ; Murakami et al . , 2008 ) . The ﬁbronectin receptor syndecan - 4 regulates GTPase activity and adhesive function to modulate cell migration ( Bass et al . , 2007a , 2007b , 2008 ; Dovas et al . , 2006 ; Morgan et al . , 2007 ; Woods et al . , 1986 ) . We have recently described a potential role for syndecan - 4 in regulating integrin endocytosis ( Bass et al . , 2011 ) , but the extent to which syndecans integrate extra - cellular and intracellular stimuli to directly regulate integrin func - tion has otherwise not been investigated . Here we demonstrate that syndecan - 4 is the major control point that regulates integrin recycling to coordinate FA dynamics and cell migration . c - Src - mediated syndecan - 4 phosphorylation is shown to regulate Arf6 activity , via modulation of syntenin binding , and acts as a molecular switch to determine directly whether a 5 b 1 or a V b 3 integrins are delivered to the membrane . Thus , we deﬁne a mechanism by which syndecan - 4 engagement and signaling exquisitely controls integrin engagement to dictate FA stability and coordinate cell migration . RESULTS Src Phosphorylates Syndecan - 4 Phosphorylation is fundamental to the regulation of adhesive function and cell migration ( Geiger et al . , 2001 ) . It has been reported that syndecan - 4 is tyrosine phosphorylated and that this modiﬁcation is sensitive to treatment with broad - spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( Ott and Rapraeger , 1998 ) . 472 Developmental Cell 24 , 472 – 485 , March 11 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . Open access under CC BY license . To understand the role syndecan - 4 plays in integrating extracel - lular and intracellular signals during cell migration , and how this function is coordinated , we set out to identify the tyrosine kinase responsible for syndecan - 4 phosphorylation . The syndecan - 4 cytoplasmic domain contains three tyrosine residues that are potential phosphorylation targets . Analysis of the syndecan - 4 cytoplasmic domain using NetPhorest , an online atlas of con - sensus sequence motifs ( Miller et al . , 2008 ) , suggested that Src - family kinases ( SFKs ) might phosphorylate syndecan - 4 on residue tyrosine 180 ( Syn4Y180 ) ( posterior probability = 0 . 085 ) . This prompted us to test whether c - Src , a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase fundamentally associated with adhesion signaling , migra - tion , and neoplastic progression ( Playford and Schaller , 2004 ; Sandilands and Frame , 2008 ) , regulates syndecan - 4 phosphor - Figure 1 . c - Src Directly Phosphorylates Syndecan - 4 ( A ) Tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous syn - decan - 4 isolated by solid - phase immunocapture from MEFs following treatment with PP2 or PP3 or with vehicle ( DMSO ) ( Nil ) .

Using solid - phase capture , we assessed tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous syndecan - 4 isolated from mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts ( MEFs ) . Treatment with the SFK inhibitor PP2 blocked syndecan - 4 phosphorylation ( Figure 1A ) , suggesting that SFKs regulate phosphorylation of syndecan - 4 . Syndecan - 4 immunoprecipita - tion followed by Phos - tag gel electrophoresis allowed band - shift resolution and quantitation of endogenous syndecan - 4 phosphorylation in human ﬁbroblasts . Phos - tag induced the appearance of a single slow - migrating phosphorylated band , possibly suggesting that , under basal conditions , syndecan - 4 may be phosphorylated on a single residue . Syndecan - 4 resolved as a monomer and a dimer by immunoblotting , consis - tent with the reported formation of SDS - resistant syndecan dimers ( Asundi and Carey , 1995 ) . In untreated cells , only 2 . 6 % of dimeric syndecan - 4 was phosphorylated , and this was reduced by SFK inhibition .

To test whether Syn4Y180 is phosphorylated , HA - tagged wild - type syndecan - 4 ( HA - Syn4WT ) or syndecan - 4 with a mutated Y180 residue ( HA - Syn4Y180L ) was expressed in 293T cells and levels of tyrosine phosphorylation were assessed . Disruption of the Syn4Y180 residue substantially reduced syndecan - 4 tyrosine phosphorylation , as determined by both solid - phase immobilization and immunoprecipitation ( Figure 1C ; Figure S1B ) . Syndecan - 4 phosphorylation was then assessed in MEFs expressing either Syn4WT or Syn4Y180L , at endogenous levels , by Phos - tag gel electrophoresis . Treatment with PP2 in - hibited Syn4WT phosphorylation by 68 % , and phosphorylation ofSyn4Y180wasreducedby70 % relativetoSyn4WT ( Figure1D ; Figure S1C ) . Therefore , syndecan - 4 can be tyrosine phosphory - lated by SFKs , and Syn4Y180 , the SFK target predicted by NetPhorest , is the major site for this modiﬁcation . To test whether c - Src phosphorylates syndecan - 4 directly , we assessed c - Src - mediated phosphorylation of isolated synde - can - 4 cytoplasmic domains . Recombinant active c - Src phos - phorylated GST - Syn4WT , but not GST alone , ina time - dependent manner ( Figure 1E ) . Similarly , recombinant , custom - synthesized syndecan - 4 cytoplasmic domain was phosphorylated by active c - Src ( Figure1F ) , andanalysisofthispeptidebyliquidchromatog - raphy - tandemmassspectrometryidentiﬁedSyn4Y180asatarget of c - Src - mediated phosphorylation ( Figure S1D ) . Consistent with Syn4Y180 being a target for c - Src , phosphorylation of GST - Syn4Y180L by active c - Src was substantially reduced relative to GST - Syn4WT ( or the control tyrosine mutant GST - Syn4Y188L ) ( Figure 1G ) . Interestingly , Y197 in the PDZ - binding domain of syndecan - 4 could also be phosphorylated by recombinant active c - Src ( Figure S1E ) , which likely accounts for the residual tyrosine phosphorylation detected upon disruption of Y180 ( Figure 1G ) . However , Phos - tag gel electrophoresis ( Figure 1D ; Figure S1C ) showed that in the cellular environment , Syn4Y180 is the major site of SFK - mediated syndecan - 4 phosphorylation . Syndecan - 4 Regulates Cell Migration and FA Dynamics To investigate the contribution of c - Src - mediated syndecan - 4 phosphorylation and signaling to cell migration , we expressed wild - type syndecan - 4 or cytoplasmic domain mutants in syndecan - 4 - null ﬁbroblasts . We generated cells expressing Syn4Y180L , which could not be phosphorylated on Y180 , and Syn4Y180E , in an attempt to generate a phosphomimetic synde - can - 4 that emulates c - Src - mediated phosphorylation of the Y180 residue ( Figure 2A ) . Modulation of Syn4Y180 in this way induced striking changes in migratory behavior : on two - dimen - sional substrates , both in scratch wound assays ( Movie S1 ; Figures 2B – 2D ) and when plated sparsely on ﬁbronectin ( Figures 2E – 2G ) , expression of the nonphosphorylatable syndecan - 4 mutant Syn4Y180L almost completely blocked net cell migra - tion . By contrast , expression of the phosphomimetic mutant Syn4Y180E induced a directionally persistent mode of migration . Consistent with other studies ( Caswell et al . , 2008 ; Danen et al . , 2005 ) , this increase in persistence was accompanied by a slight reduction in migration speed . Cell movement has an essential reliance on precise coordina - tion of dynamic cell - ECM interactions . Overall , FA dynamics are a function of adhesion contact formation , maturation , stabi - lization , translocation , dissociation , and the diffusion and mobility of individual FA components . In view of the effects of Syn4Y180 phosphorylation on migration , we sought to deter - mine whether modiﬁcation of this residue was involved in the regulation of FA dynamics . As the FA adaptor protein vinculin provides a physical link between ECM - bound integrins and the actin cytoskeleton , we initially used live - cell imaging of GFP - vinculin to monitor FA dynamics in Syn4WT - , Syn4Y180L - , and Syn4Y180E - expressing cells ( Movie S2 ; Figures 3A – 3C ; Figures S2A and S2B ) . The FAs of Syn4WT - expressing cells translo - cated centripetally at 0 . 106 ± 0 . 012 m m / min . By contrast , Syn4Y180E cells maintained relatively static FAs , with substan - tially reduced rates of FA translocation ( 0 . 048 ± 0 . 003 m m / min ) and decreased turnover ( as indicated by increased FA lifetime ) . FAs in cells expressing Syn4Y180L were smaller , translocated more rapidly ( 0 . 126 ± 0 . 007 m m / min ) , and displayed signiﬁcantly increased turnover . Analysis of endogenous FA translocation , by interference reﬂection microscopy , also showed that expression of Syn4Y180E increased FA stability ( Figure S2C ) . To assess the dynamics of FA components , we next used ﬂuo - rescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) . Expression of mutant syndecan - 4 constructs had no signiﬁcant effect on the GFP - vinculin mobile fraction ( Figure S2D ) , but signiﬁcantly altered the half - time of recovery ( Figure 3D ) . Expression of phos - phomimetic Syn4Y180E substantially increased the half - time of recovery of vinculin ( 84 . 8 ± 4 . 3 s ) , demonstrating adhesion complex stabilization . By contrast , expression of phosphoryla - tion - resistant Syn4Y180L did not alter the rate of GFP - vinculin recovery compared to the wild - type receptor ( 62 . 2 ± 4 . 5 s and 59 . 4 ± 4 . 0 s , respectively ) . Given the fundamental contribution of adhesion dynamics to the regulation of cell migration , it is perhaps not surprising that , on ﬁbrillar cell - derived matrices , expression of phosphomimetic Syn4Y180E , which suppressed FA dynamics , substantially reduced migration speed and relative displacement by inducing a striking tail retraction defect ( Figures S2E – S2G ) . These data suggest that the phosphorylation status of Syn4Y180 dictates both the migratory characteristics of cells and the dynamics of their FAs . Indeed , Syn4Y180 appears to function as a switch between two distinct modes of behavior characterized either by accelerated turnover of FAs and a com - plete inability to migrate ( Syn4Y180L ) or by increased FA stabili - zation resulting indirectionally persistent migration ( Syn4Y180E ) . Src - Mediated Phosphorylation ofSyndecan - 4 Regulates FA Dynamics To test the role of c - Src in regulating FA dynamics , constitutively active SrcY527F was coexpressed with GFP - vinculin in cells ex - pressing endogenous syndecan - 4 . SrcY527F expression signif - icantly increased the half - time of recovery of GFP - vinculin ( Figures4A – 4C ) , consistentwithFAstabilization ( NIH3T3SrcWT : 66 . 2±7 . 1s ; SrcY527F : 89 . 0±8 . 9s ) . Thisﬁndingwasalsoconsis - tent with the increased half - time of recovery of GFP - vinculin inducedbyphosphomimeticsyndecan - 4Y180Eexpression ( Fig - ure 3D ) . By contrast , kinase - dead Src251 did not signiﬁcantly affect the dynamics of GFP - vinculin recovery . Constitutively active SrcY527F also decreased the rate of GFP - vinculin re - covery in cells expressing Syn4WT ( SrcY527F : 91 . 7 ± 5 . 3 s Developmental Cell Syndecan - 4 Regulates Integrin Trafﬁcking 474 Developmental Cell 24 , 472 – 485 , March 11 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . versus SrcWT : 62 . 1 ± 4 . 4 s ) . Importantly , however , introduction of active SrcY527F or kinase - dead Src251 had no effect on vinculin recovery in Syn4 (cid:1) / (cid:1) , Syn4Y180L , or Syn4Y180E cells , which are all unable to be modiﬁed on Y180 by c - Src ( Fig - ure 4D ; Figure S2H ) . Thus , c - Src - mediated suppression of FA dynamics is dependent on both syndecan - 4 expression and the integrity of the Y180 residue . These data demonstrate that c - Src - dependent Syn4Y180 phosphorylation increases FA sta - bility and are consistent with phosphomimetic Syn4Y180E sup - pressing FA turnover , FA translocation , and vinculin dynamics ( Figure 3 ) . Syndecan - 4 Phosphorylation Regulates Integrin Recycling We next sought to determine the mechanism by which c - Src - mediated phosphorylation of syndecan - 4 regulates FA dynamics . It has previously been shown that differential expres - sion of speciﬁc integrin heterodimers regulates FA dynamics and cell migration ( Danen et al . , 2005 ; Worth et al . , 2010 ) . In epithelial cells , expression of a 5 b 1 integrin promotes FA turn - over and random cell motility , whereas expression of a V b 3 suppresses FA dynamics and promotes directionally persistent migration ( Danen et al . , 2005 ) . Because these cellular character - istics are remarkably similar to those seen in cells expressing Syn4WT and Syn4Y180E , respectively ( Figures 2 and 3 ) , we investigated whether disruption of the syndecan - 4 Y180 residue altered expression of the prototypic ﬁbronectin receptors a 5 b 1 and a V b 3 . Syn4WT , Syn4 (cid:1) / (cid:1) , Syn4Y180L , and Syn4Y180E cell lines each expressed similar total levels of a 5 , b 1 , a V , and b 3 integrin protein , as assessed by western blotting ( Figure 5A ; Figure S3A ) ; however , ﬂow cytometry and quantitative immuno - ﬂuorescence imaging demonstrated highly elevated levels of Figure 2 .

By contrast , expression of Syn4Y180E reduced the levels of a 5 b 1 and increased the levels of the a V integrin subunit at the cell surface and in FAs ( Figures 5C and 5D ; Figure S3C ) . The change in surface localization , rather than protein expres - sion of a 5 and a V integrins , led us to investigate the intracellular trafﬁcking of surface - labeled integrins . Modulation of the Syn4Y180 residue did not inﬂuence integrin internalization in a manner that could be responsible for heterodimer - speciﬁc in - tegrin localization ( Figures S3D and S3E ) . However , compared to wild - type syndecan - 4 , expression of Syn4Y180L substantially increased recycling of a 5 b 1 to the membrane and , reciprocally , suppressed redelivery of a V b 3 ( Figure 5E ) . Conversely , recy - cling of a 5 b 1 was inhibited by expression of phosphomimetic Syn4Y180E , whereas membrane trafﬁcking of a V b 3 was unaffected ( Figure 5F ) . Thus , the phosphorylation status of Syn4Y180 dictates speciﬁcally which integrin heterodimers are recycled to the membrane . Interestingly , recycling of a 5 b 1 and a V b 3 was not disrupted in syndecan - 4 - deﬁcient cells ( Figure S3F ) , suggesting that , in the absence of syndecan - 4 , cells undergo a degree of reprogram - ming to allow syndecan - independent recycling of a 5 b 1 and a V b 3 . This may explain why migration of syndecan - 4 - null cells , on 2D substrates , was similar to that of cells expressing wild - type syndecan - 4 ( Figure 2 ) . The fact that cells adopt alternative mechanisms to regulate integrin recycling upon deletion of syn - decan - 4 may be a testament to the importance of this process in normal physiological function .

Syndecan - 4 Phosphorylation Regulates Arf6 Activity The small GTPase Arf6 is activated upon ECM engagement ( Balasubramanian et al . , 2007 ) and can regulate recycling of receptors from the perinuclear recycling compartment to the membrane ( D’Souza - Schorey and Chavrier , 2006 ) . Syndecans and integrins are among the receptors known to be trafﬁcked by Arf6 , but the molecular mechanisms and heterodimer speci - ﬁcity of this regulation have not been deﬁned ( Dunphy et al . , 2006 ; Powelka et al . , 2004 ; Zimmermann et al . , 2005 ) . The ability of syndecan - 4 Y180 mutants to regulate differential recycling of a 5 b 1 and a V b 3 integrins prompted us to test whether syndecan - 4 , and speciﬁcally phosphorylation of the Y180 residue , regulates Arf6 activity . Effector pull - down assays showed that , compared to cells expressing Syn4WT , phosphomimetic Syn4Y180E - expressing cells had substantially reduced steady - state levels of Arf6 activity ( Figure 6A ) , which could explain the reduced recy - cling of a 5 b 1 integrin ( Figure 5F ) . By contrast , cells expressing Syn4Y180L displayed high levels of Arf6 activity , similar to those in Syn4WT cells ( Figure 6A ) . Some of our data suggested that syndecan - 4 - null cells may be subject to compensation mechanisms as , despite having low levels of basal Arf6 Activity ( Figure 6A ) and reduced rates of vin - culin recovery ( Figure 3D ) , they displayed normal 2D migration ( Figure 2 ) and integrin recycling ( Figure S3E ) . Consequently , it was important to assess the effects of modulating the phosphor - ylation competence of syndecan - 4 in cells of wild - type back - ground . Therefore , we expressed human Syn4WT , Syn4Y180L , and Syn4Y180E in NIH 3T3 - derived cells and used siRNA to tran - siently silence endogenous mouse syndecan - 4 ( Figure S4A ) . Importantly , FRAP analysis revealed that , although suppression of endogenous syndecan - 4 slightly reduced the rate of vinculin recovery relative to cells expressing huSyn4WT , expression of phosphomimetic huSyn4Y180E substantially reduced vinculin recovery . Moreover , in this cellular context , expression of huSyn4Y180L increased the rate of vinculin recovery relative to expression of huSyn4WT ( Figures S4B and S4C ) . Furthermore , expression of huSyn4Y180E suppressed steady - state Arf6 activity , whereas nonphosphorylatable huSyn4Y180L activated Arf6 activity upon suppression of endogenous msSyn4 ex - pression ( Figure S4D ) . Consistent with these effects on FA dynamics and Arf6 activity , expression of huSyn4Y180L reduced migration speed following suppression of endogenous msSyn4 Figure 4 . c - Src - Mediated Phosphorylation of Syndecan - 4 Stabilizes FAs ( A – C ) FRAPanalysisofGFP - vinculininNIH3T3cells ( AandB ) orwild - typeMEFs ( C ) cotransfected withc - Srcconstructs ( wild - typeSrcWT , constitutivelyprimed SrcY527F , or kinase - deleted Src251 ) .

Thus , expres - sion of syndecan - 4 phosphorylation - site mutants differentially regulated Arf6 activity , FA dynamics , and cell migration in both syndecan - 4 - null cells and cells derived from a wild - type background following suppression of endogenous syndecan - 4 , further highlighting the importance of Syn4Y180 in controlling cellular function . To assess directly the contribution of syndecan - 4 engagement to Arf6 activity modulation , human ﬁbroblasts ( ex - pressing endogenous syndecan - 4 ) were prespread on a fragment of ﬁbronectin containing the integrin - binding central cell - binding domain ( 50K / Fn6 - 10 ) and stimulated with a soluble fragment of ﬁbronectin containing the syndecan - binding domain ( H0 ) , as described previ - ously ( Bass et al . , 2007a ) . Stimulation with the syndecan ligand substantially increased Arf6 activity , but not following siRNA - mediated suppression of syndecan - 4 expression , demonstrating that engagement of endogenous syndecan - 4 is required and sufﬁcient to stimulate Arf6 activation ( Figure S4G ) . Importantly , although H0 stimulation of Syn4WT cells induced Developmental Cell Syndecan - 4 Regulates Integrin Trafﬁcking 478 Developmental Cell 24 , 472 – 485 , March 11 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . a substantial increase in Arf6 activity , it had no effect on the acti - vation status of Arf6 in cells harboring mutations in the Y180 residue ( Figure 6B ) . Cells expressing Syn4Y180L had constitu - tively elevated Arf6 activity , even in the absence of syndecan ligation , whereas phosphomimetic Syn4Y180E cells had sup - pressed levels of Arf6 activity , even after syndecan - 4 engage - ment ( Figure 6B ) , despite the fact that mutation of Syn4Y180 did not alter H0 binding ( Figure S4H ) . Thus , Arf6 activation is dependent on syndecan - 4 expression and engagement and the integrity of the Y180 residue . This suggests that syndecan - 4 engagement dynamically regulates Arf6 activity and that this is controlled by the Y180 phosphorylation status . As c - Src phosphorylates syndecan - 4 on Y180 , we tested whether c - Src activity could inﬂuence Arf6 activation . Figure 6 .

Steady - state Arf6 activity was assessed in cells expressing either wild - type or constitutively active c - Src ( SrcWT - Venus1 and SrcY527F - Venus1 , respectively ) . Consistent with the reduced levels of Arf6 activity observed in cells expressing phos - phomimetic Syn4Y180E , expression of constitutively active c - Src signiﬁcantly reduced Arf6 activity ( Figure 6C ; Figure S4I ) . Importantly , active c - Src did not suppress Arf6 activity in cells expressing Syn4Y180L ( Figure S4I ) , suggesting that c - Src sup - presses Arf6 activity by phosphorylating syndecan - 4 on Y180 . Moreover , c - Src - mediated inhibition of Arf6 activity was not limited to ﬁbroblasts , as a similar response was observed in A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells ( Figure S4J ) . As c - Src - mediated syndecan - 4 Y180 phosphorylation regu - lates both differential recycling of a 5 b 1 and a V b 3 integrins ( Figures 5E and 5F ) and Arf6 activity ( Figures 6A – 6C ; Figures S4D , S4G , S4I , and S4J ) , we examined the role of Arf6 in regu - lating integrin trafﬁcking . siRNA - mediated knockdown of Arf6 expression in human ﬁbroblasts signiﬁcantly reduced the levels of a 5 b 1 in FAs ( Figure 6D ; Figure S5E ) and induced a reciprocal increase of a V b 3 in FAs ( Figures 6E and 6F ; Figures S5F and S5G ) . Moreover , suppression of Arf6 expression substantially decreased serum - stimulated recycling of a 5 b 1 , whereas it had no effect on the high levels of a V b 3 trafﬁcking ( Figure S5H ) . Simi - larly , siRNA - mediated knockdown of mouse Arf6 in NIH 3T3 cells also suppressed a 5 b 1 recycling , and this effect was rescued by expression of siRNA - resistant human Arf6 ( Figure 6H ; Fig - ure S5A ) . Thus , inhibition of Arf6 expression recapitulated the integrin localization and recycling proﬁle seen in cells express - ing the phosphomimetic syndecan - 4 construct Syn4Y180E , which suppresses Arf6 activation . Conversely , expression of Arf6T157A , a fast - cycling , constitutively active mutant that spon - taneously exchanges nucleotides ( Santy , 2002 ) , substantially increased recycling of a 5 b 1 and decreased recycling of a V b 3 , compared with cells expressing Arf6WT ( Figure 6G ) . It is notable that the effect of expressing Arf6T157A on heterodimer - speciﬁc integrin trafﬁcking is very similar to that seen with expression of Syn4Y180L ( the syndecan - 4 mutant that is resistant to c - Src - mediated phosphorylation and promotes Arf6 activity even in the absence of syndecan - 4 engagement ) . To test the generality of our ﬁndings , we tested whether Arf6 regulates heterodimer - speciﬁc integrin recycling in nonﬁbro - blastic cells . Arf6 expression was suppressed in A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells and A375 - SM malignant melanoma cells , which both use a 5 b 1 , a V b 3 , and syndecan - 4 to engage ﬁbronectin , and in both cell lines Arf6 inhibition blocked recycling of a 5 b 1 but not a V b 3 ( Figures S5B , S5C , S5I , and S5J ) . Thus , the effect of Arf6 inhibition in these tumor cell lines was highly reminiscent of that in human ﬁbroblasts and MEFs ( Figure 6G ; Figure S5H ) . These data , in conjunction with the fact that active c - Src sup - pressed Arf6 activity in nonﬁbroblastic cells ( Figure S4J ) , suggest that c - Src - mediated syndecan phosphorylation sup - pressing Arf6 activity to control heterodimer - speciﬁc integrin recycling is a general mechanism for controlling differential receptor engagement during cell migration . Under steady - state conditions , syndecan - 4 exhibited a low stoichiometry of phosphorylation ( Figures 1B and 1D ; Figures S1A and S1C ) . However , the profound differences in integrin traf - ﬁcking and cell migration elicited by either phospho - null or phos - phomimetic Syn4Y180 mutations ( Figures 2 and 5E ) suggest that for integrins to be recycled appropriately , and for cells to migrate efﬁciently , phosphorylation of Y180 must be dynamically regu - lated . Therefore , we tested whether syndecan - 4 phosphoryla - tion was inﬂuenced by extracellular stimuli . In human ﬁbroblasts , serum stimulation triggered a wave of endogenous syndecan - 4 phosphorylation ( Figure 6I ; Figure S5K ) . Similarly , in HA - Syn4 - expressing MEFs , serum stimulation induced an approximately 3 - fold increase in phosphorylation of Syn4WT , whereas pertur - bation of the Syn4Y180 residue completely inhibited the ability of serum to trigger syndecan - 4 phosphorylation ( Figure 6J ; Figure S5L ) . Thus , syndecan - 4 Y180 phosphorylation is dynam - ically regulated by extracellular signals in a manner consistent with syndecan - 4 operating as an environmental sensor to coor - dinate integrin recycling and engagement during cell migration . Syndecan - 4 - Mediated Arf6 Activity Regulates FA Dynamics As disruption of the c - Src phosphorylation site within syn - decan - 4 induced defects in Arf6 activation , integrin trafﬁcking , and FA dynamics ( Figures 3 , 5 , and 6 ) , and because Arf6 controlled heterodimer - speciﬁc recycling of integrins to the membrane ( Figure 6 ) , a process that is regulated by syndecan - 4 Y180 ( Figure 5 ) , we used FRAP and live - cell imaging to test whether Arf6 regulates FA dynamics . In ﬁbroblasts expressing endogenous syndecan - 4 , both siRNA - mediated Arf6 knock - down and expression of a dominant - negative Arf6T27N mutant ( D’Souza - Schorey et al . , 1995 ) stabilized FAs , increasing the half - time of recovery of GFP - vinculin ( Figures 7A and 7B ; Figures S6A and S6B ) . Moreover , knockdown of mouse Arf6 in NIH 3T3 ( Ctrl KD ) , mouse Arf6 - targeting siRNA ( msArf6 KD ) , or mouse Arf6 - targeting siRNA and human Arf6 cDNA ( msArf6 KD + huArf6 ) ( n = 52 – 53 ) .

We further probed the role of Arf6 in regulating FA dynamics by performing live - cell total internal reﬂection ﬂuores - cence ( TIRF ) imaging of GFP - vinculin in cells expressing Arf6WT , dominant - negative Arf6T27N , or fast - cycling Arf6T157A ( Movie S3 ; Figures 7D and 7E ; Figures S6D and S6E ) . Compared to Arf6WT - expressing cells , Arf6T27N cells exhibited relatively static FAs with substantially reduced rates of FA trans - location ( Arf6WT : 0 . 079 ± 0 . 003 m m / min ; Arf6T27N : 0 . 052 ± 0 . 002 m m / min ) . By contrast , FAs in cells expressing Arf6T157A translocated more rapidly ( 0 . 145 ± 0 . 005 m m / min ) and dissoci - ated more quickly ( Arf6WT FA lifetime : 78 . 2 ± 1 . 4 min ; Arf6T157A FA lifetime : 55 . 6 ± 1 . 4 min ) . Together , these ﬁndings are consis - tent with the alterations in FA dynamics induced by modulating the phosphorylation status of syndecan - 4 Y180 ( Figure 3 ) . We next introduced dominant - negative and fast - cycling Arf6 constructs into cells expressing Syn4WT , Syn4Y180L , or Syn4Y180E and assessed GFP - vinculin turnover by FRAP ( Figures S6F and S6G ) . Similar to cells expressing endogenous syndecan - 4 , expression of dominant - negative Arf6T27N in Syn4WT cells substantially increased the half - time of recovery of GFP - vinculin ( Arf6WT : 60 . 4 ± 5 . 4 s ; Arf6T27N : 88 . 2 ± 5 . 0 s ) . Moreover , the same construct stabilized the FAs of Syn4Y180L cells , suggesting that Arf6 lies downstream of syndecan - 4 . In cells expressing Syn4Y180E , which already have stable FAs , introduction of Arf6T27N had no further effect on vinculin dynamics ; however , overexpression of either the fast - cycling Arf6T157A mutant or Arf6WT was sufﬁcient to increase the turn - over of vinculin . Thus , modulation of Arf6 activity is sufﬁcient to rescue the FA defects induced by perturbation of the c - Src - phosphorylation motif of syndecan - 4 . These data are consistent with Arf6 functioning downstream of c - Src - mediated syndecan - 4 phosphorylation in order to regulate heterodimer - speciﬁc in - tegrin recycling and FA dynamics . Syndecan - 4 Y180 Modulates Syntenin Binding Phosphorylation often modulates protein - protein interactions in order to spatially coordinate cellular functions . Syntenin is a syndecan - binding adaptor protein known to inﬂuence Arf6 - dependent recycling of syndecans ( Zimmermann et al . , 2005 ) . Therefore , we tested whether Syn4Y180 modulates syntenin binding . In GST pull - down assays ( Figure 7F ) and coimmunopre - cipitation from cells expressing GFP - syntenin ( Figure 7G ) , phos - phomimetic Syn4Y180E enhanced syntenin binding , whereas phospho - null Syn4Y180L mutation inhibited syntenin binding , suggesting that phosphorylation of Syn4Y180 promotes the association with syntenin . In both assays , a phosphomimetic mutation in the PDZ - binding domain ( Syn4Y197E ) was used as a negative control , as phosphorylation of the equivalent residue in syndecan - 1 has been shown to inhibit syntenin binding ( Sulka et al . , 2009 ) . As the phosphorylation competence of Syn4Y180 modulates syntenin binding and Arf6 activity , and syntenin regulates Arf6 - dependent receptor recycling , we tested whether syntenin binding directly inﬂuences Arf6 activity . Under steady - state conditions , compared to Syn4WT , expression of Syn4Y180E suppressed Arf6 activity ( Figure 6A ; Figure S4D ) ; however , syntenin knockdown elevated Arf6 activity in cells ex - pressing Syn4Y180E to levels similar to Syn4WT ( Figure 7H ) . Moreover , in Syn4WT and Syn4Y180E cells plated on 50K , which both exhibit low levels of Arf6 activity ( Figure 6B ) , suppression of syntenin expression promoted Arf6 activity to levels that were comparable to Syn4Y180L ( Figure 7I ) . Because simulating Syn4Y180 phosphorylation enhances syntenin binding and suppresses Arf6 activity and , in this cellular context , inhibiting syntenin expression or syntenin - syndecan - 4 binding elevates Arf6 activity , these data suggest that syndecan - 4 Y180 phos - phorylation promotes syntenin binding in order to suppress Arf6 activity . Cell migration requires precise coordination of integrin en - gagement and adhesion contact dynamics . As syndecan - 4 phosphorylation and syntenin binding regulate Arf6 activity to control integrin trafﬁcking and FA dynamics , we assessed the effect of modulating Arf6 activity on cell migration . Expression of fast - cycling Arf6T157A ( which decreases FA stability by promoting a 5 b 1 , and suppressing a V b 3 , recycling ) substantially reduced migration of cells expressing endogenous syndecan - 4 , Syn4WT , and Syn4Y180E to levels similar to cells expressing nonphosphorylatable Syn4Y180L ( Figures 7J and 7K , S6H and S6I , and 2B – 2G , respectively ) . Importantly , expression of Arf6WT in Syn4Y180E cells , which enhanced FA dynamics ( Figure S6F ) , was sufﬁcient to induce a switch from directionally persistent to random migration ( similar to Syn4WT - expressing cells ) ( Figures S6H and S6I ) . Overall , the data in this study demonstrate that c - Src - mediated phosphorylation of synde - can - 4 differentially regulates Arf6 - dependent recycling of a 5 b 1 and a V b 3 integrins to control FA turnover and that precise spatio - temporal coordination of these events is required to allow efﬁ - cient cell migration . DISCUSSION In this study , we have identiﬁed syndecan - 4 phosphorylation as a key control point driving membrane delivery of speciﬁc integrin heterodimers to control FA dynamics and coordinate cell migra - tion . Speciﬁcally , we show the following : ( 1 ) c - Src phosphorylates syndecan - 4 directly on Y180 , and this modiﬁcation leads to a stabilization of FAs . ( 2 ) ECM engagement of syndecan - 4 activates the small GTPase Arf6 , and c - Src - mediated syndecan - 4 phosphor - ylation suppresses Arf6 activity . ( 3 ) Syndecan - 4 - mediated Arf6 activation drives recycling of a 5 b 1 integrin to the plasma membrane , and suppresses trafﬁcking of a V b 3 , to promote FA turnover . ( 4 ) Syndecan - 4 - dependent inactivation of Arf6 suppresses recycling of a 5 b 1 , increases levels of a V b 3 at the cell - ECM interface , and stabilizes FAs . Taking these ﬁndings together , c - Src - mediated phosphoryla - tion of syndecan - 4 functions as a molecular switch to regulate Arf6 activity differentially and dictate , in response to the extracel - lular environment , whether a 5 b 1 or a V b 3 integrins are recycled to the membrane to coordinate FA dynamics . During cell migration , FA turnover and stabilization need to be controlled precisely to orchestrate protrusion , tail retraction , and the appli - cation of locomotive cytoskeletal forces ( Geiger et al . , 2001 ; Ridley et al . , 2003 ) . Our data suggest that in migrating cells , Developmental Cell Syndecan - 4 Regulates Integrin Trafﬁcking 482 Developmental Cell 24 , 472 – 485 , March 11 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . c - Src - mediated phosphorylation of syndecan - 4 is tightly and dynamically regulated in order to control heterodimer - speciﬁc recycling and engagement of a 5 b 1 or a V b 3 integrins in a spatially and temporally restricted manner , and that this allows precise coordination of FA dynamics to promote efﬁcient migration . It is becoming increasingly clear that intracellular trafﬁcking plays a pivotal role in regulating integrin engagement and sig - naling during cell migration ( Caswell et al . , 2009 ; Pellinen et al . , 2006 ) and that reciprocal antagonism between the recy - cling pathways of a 5 b 1 and a V b 3 regulates heterodimer - speciﬁc signaling and cell migration ( Caswell et al . , 2008 , 2009 ; Morgan et al . , 2009 ; White et al . , 2007 ) . Our data demonstrate that syndecan - 4 coordinates these processes in an Arf6 - dependent manner . As syndecan - 4 - dependent Arf6 activation was regu - lated by extracellular syndecan - 4 engagement ( Figure 6B ; Figure S4G ) , this suggests that syndecan - 4 functions as a ‘‘molecular antenna’’ sensing the microenvironment in order to spatially control the downstream localization , engagement , and function of anchoring molecules such as integrins . Integrin a V b 3 is relatively immobile in FAs ( Hu et al . , 2007 ) and has a faster on / off binding rate for ligand than a 5 b 1 , allowing it to act as a mechanosensor requiring clustering and cytoskeletal adaptor recruitment to promote reinforcement and stabilization of adhesion , whereas a 5 b 1 supports high ECM forces ( Puklin - Faucher and Sheetz , 2009 ; Roca - Cusachs et al . , 2009 ) . So , by driving heterodimer - speciﬁc integrin recycling and clustering , syndecan - 4 signaling has the capacity to coordinate the biome - chanical response to the microenvironment during cell migration . Although it is currently not clear which extracellular signals promote c - Src - mediated syndecan - 4 phosphorylation in order to suppress Arf6 activity and modulate integrin trafﬁcking , Src can associate with , and be activated or inactivated by , a range of different receptors , including integrins and growth factor receptors ( Brunton et al . , 2004 ; Playford and Schaller , 2004 ; Streuli and Akhtar , 2009 ) . As syndecans act as receptors for ECM molecules and coreceptors for growth factors and cyto - kines ( Alexopoulou et al . , 2007 ; Bass et al . , 2009 ; Morgan et al . , 2007 ; Murakami et al . , 2008 ) , it is possible that they function as a nexus to integrate both ECM - associated and secreted microenvironmental signals . Intriguingly , c - Src binds to and can be activated by a V b 3 integrin ( Arias - Salgado et al . , 2003 ; Morgan et al . , 2009 ) . Because syndecan - 4 is phosphory - lated by c - Src to drive a V b 3 recycling , syndecan - 4 - dependent receptor trafﬁcking and FA stabilization potentially could be regulated by positive reinforcement mechanisms . By contrast , Arf6 can regulate recycling of syndecans to the membrane ( Zim - mermann et al . , 2005 ) and syndecan - 4 engagement promotes Arf6 activity , suggesting another potential positive feedback mechanism . It follows that , in vivo , c - Src activity and synde - can - 4 phosphorylation must be tightly regulated . Consistent with this notion , the basal stoichiometry of syndecan - 4 Y180 phosphorylation was low yet dynamically regulated by extracel - lular stimuli , suggesting a model whereby syndecan - 4 senses and interprets the extracellular environment to control Arf6 activity in a spatially and temporally restricted manner . It will now be instructive to determine the mechanisms by which extracellular signals are integrated to constrain syndecan - 4 phosphorylation and coordinate integrin trafﬁcking . Phosphorylation of syndecan - 4 Y180 promoted syntenin bind - ing in order to suppress Arf6 activity . Although syndecans asso - ciate with syntenin via C - terminal PDZ - binding motifs , distal phosphorylation events have been previously shown to modu - late syntenin binding ( Koo et al . , 2006 ) . However , the mechanism by which the syndecan - syntenin association inﬂuences Arf6 activity is unclear ; it may have a direct effect on the activity of Arf6 regulators ( e . g . , guanine nucleotide exchange factors or GTPase - activating proteins ) , or it may provide a platform for the spatial compartmentalization of intracellular signals . The syndecan - 4 Y180 residue is conserved between all syndecans , as is the ability to bind syntenin , and thus it is tempting to spec - ulate that , in different cellular or environmental contexts , phos - phorylation of the equivalent residue in other syndecans may also modulate receptor trafﬁcking , perhaps impacting different integrins or classes of receptor . We have delineated a mechanism that deﬁnes syndecan - 4 as a signaling nexus to integrate c - Src signaling and extracel - lular stimuli to control membrane delivery of integrins , regulate FA dynamics , and modulate cell migration . It is notable that many of the molecules and processes identiﬁed in this study , including SFKs , Arf6 , and differential integrin expression and recycling , play a fundamental role in both wound healing and cancer invasion ( Caswell et al . , 2009 ; Muralidharan - Chari et al . , 2009 ; Playford and Schaller , 2004 ) . Thus , understanding syndecan - 4 - mediated coordination of these processes will improve our understanding of migration in both health and disease .

Cell migration was tracked manually using the MTrackJ plug - in for ImageJ . Migration tracks were plotted using the Chemotaxis Tool and Manual Tracking ImageJ plug - ins . Fluorescence Live - Cell Imaging Cells expressing GFP - vinculin were plated on ﬁbronectin 24 – 48 hr posttrans - fection in the presence of 2 % FBS . Time - lapse epiﬂuorescence images were acquired on an Olympus inverted microscope ( IX71 ) using DeltaVisionRT soft - ware ( Applied Precision ) ( 1 image every 7 . 5 min over 8 hr ) . Live - cell TIRF images were acquired on a TE2000 microscope ( Nikon ) using a 488 nm laser ( 1 image every 1 . 5 min over 2 hr ) using point visiting and a Cascade 512B EM CCD camera ( Photometrics ) . Details of FA translocation and lifetime analysis and data presentation are available in Supplemental Experimental Procedures . Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching Cells expressing GFP - vinculin were plated on ﬁbronectin 24 – 48 hr posttrans - fection and imaged at 37 (cid:3) C in Ham’s F12 medium supplemented with 2 % FBS . FRAP was performed on an Olympus inverted microscope ( IX71 ) equip - ped with a 488 nm FRAP laser under the control of DeltaVisionRT software ( Applied Precision ) using a 100 3 / NA 1 . 40 Plan Apo objective . Images were acquired every 3 s for 180 s postphotobleaching . One micrometer - diameter regions of interest were selected , and half - time of recovery ( t 1 / 2 ) and mobile fraction were calculated using softWoRx FRAP photokinetic analysis software ( Applied Precision ) . The mobile fraction indicates the amount of a molecule that is freely mobile , whereas changes in the t 1 / 2 signify alterations in diffusion or binding to , or release from , an immobile substrate within a complex ( e . g . , integrins ) . Flow Cytometry Cells were detached using trypsin / EDTA or enzyme - free Hanks’ - based cell - dissociation buffer ( Invitrogen ) , washed , immunolabeled , and analyzed on a Beckman Coulter Cyan ADP . Further details are available in Supplemental Experimental Procedures . Immunoﬂuorescence and Image Analysis For standard immunoﬂuorescence , cells were plated on ﬁbronectin - coated coverslips in the presence of 2 % FBS for 3 hr , ﬁxed , and immunostained . Immunoﬂuorescent images were acquired on an Olympus IX71 using DeltaVisionRT software and analyzed using ImageJ . Further details are avail - able in Supplemental Experimental Procedures . Recycling Assays Recycling of surface - biotinylated receptors from the perinuclear recycling compartment was assessed as previously described ( Roberts et al . , 2001 ) with the following modiﬁcations . All washes after the initial biotinylation step were performed with ice - cold Krebs buffer . Receptors were internalized in DMEM for 30 min at 37 (cid:3) C . Serum - stimulated recycling of internalized recep - tors back to the membrane was stimulated with DMEM and 15 % FBS at 37 (cid:3) C . Integrins werecaptured for ELISA ( antibodies are listed inSupplemental Experimental Procedures ) , and biotinylation was detected using ExtrAvidin - Peroxidase and ABTS ( Bass et al . , 2007a ) . Total levels of integrin internaliza - tion after 30 min at 37 (cid:3) C were also calculated . Arf6 Effector Pull - Down Assays Arf6 activity was assessed by GST - GGA3 pull - down assay , as described previously ( Santy and Casanova , 2001 ) . Arf6 activity was determined for cells on ﬁbronectin in the presence of 2 % FBS for 4 hr ( steady - state ) , or on 50K fol - lowed by 90 min stimulation with or without H0 . Further details are available in Supplemental Experimental Procedures . Statistical Analyses Data were analyzed using Student’s unpaired t tests or Z tests . p < 0 . 05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant . p values and statistical tests are quoted in the ﬁgure legends .
