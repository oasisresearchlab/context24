E - mail : james . lopez - bernal @ lshtm . ac . uk Accepted 7 April 2016 Abstract Interrupted time series ( ITS ) analysis is a valuable study design for evaluating the effective - ness of population - level health interventions that have been implemented at a clearly deﬁned point in time . It is increasingly being used to evaluate the effectiveness of interven - tions ranging from clinical therapy to national public health legislation . Whereas the de - sign shares many properties of regression - based approaches in other epidemiological studies , there are a range of unique features of time series data that require additional methodological considerations . In this tutorial we use a worked example to demonstrate a robust approach to ITS analysis using segmented regression . We begin by describing the design and considering when ITS is an appropriate design choice . We then discuss the es - sential , yet often omitted , step of proposing the impact model a priori . Subsequently , we demonstrate the approach to statistical analysis including the main segmented regression model . Finally we describe the main methodological issues associated with ITS analysis : over - dispersion of time series data , autocorrelation , adjusting for seasonal trends and con - trolling for time - varying confounders , and we also outline some of the more complex de - sign adaptations that can be used to strengthen the basic ITS design . Key Messages • Interrupted time series is a valuable study design for evaluating the effectiveness of population - level health interventions . • A segmented regression approach can be used to analyse an interrupted time series study by testing the effect of an intervention on the outcome of interest using an appropriately deﬁned impact model . • Methodological considerations speciﬁc to interrupted time series analysis include possible time - varying confounders such as seasonal trends or concurrent events to the intervention , and potential autocorrelation of data .

Here , we aim to demonstrate a step - by - step ITS analysis including : considering when an ITS might be an appropriate design choice and the data required ; hypoth - esizing the type of impact the intervention will have on the out - come ; how to use a regression model to analyse the effect ; the main methodological issues that need to be taken into account ; and finally , a brief outline of model checking techniques . A worked example is used to illustrate the methods ( Box 1 ) and the supplementary material ( available as Supplementary data at IJE online ) includes the dataset used as well as code for use with the statistical packages Stata and R , so that readers may reproduce the analysis . The interrupted time series design A time series is a continuous sequence of observations on a population , taken repeatedly ( normally at equal intervals ) over time . In an ITS study , a time series of a particular out - come of interest is used to establish an underlying trend , which is ‘interrupted’ by an intervention at a known point in time . The hypothetical scenario under which the intervention had not taken place and the trend continues un - changed ( that is : the ‘expected’ trend , in the absence of the intervention , given the pre - existing trend ) is referred to as the ‘counterfactual’ . This counterfactual scenario provides a comparison for the evaluation of the impact of the interven - tion by examining any change occurring in the post - intervention period . 12 , 17 Figure 1 illustrates the design using the smoking ban example ( Box 1 ) : the graph displays the pre - intervention trend of monthly rates of ACE admissions ( continuous line ) , and the counterfactual scenario ( dashed line ) . Given that most of the points lie below the counterfac - tual line , there is a visual suggestion of a decrease in the ACE admissions in the post - intervention period which is compatible with a possible positive impact of the smoking ban . ITS models , described below , can provide statistical evidence about whether this represents a real decrease . Step 1 : is an interrupted time series design appropriate ? The first decision when considering an ITS is whether it is an appropriate design for the particular evaluation in question . This depends on the nature of both the intervention and the outcome of interest , as well as the type of data available : The intervention ITS requires a clear differentiation of the pre - intervention period and the post - intervention period . In some evalu - ations it may be difficult to define when the intervention began and to differentiate the effects of different Box 1 . The worked example The example dataset used in this paper is taken from a study by Barone - Adesi et al . on the effects of the Italian smoking ban in public places on hospital admissions for acute coronary events ( ACEs , ICD10 410 - 411 ) . In January 2005 , Italy introduced regulations to ban smok - ing in all indoor public places , with the aim of limiting the adverse health effects of second - hand smoke . The subset used here are ACEs in the Sicily region between 2002 and 2006 among those aged 0 - 69 years . This data - set is available in Supplementary Appendix 1 with an excerpt presented in Table 1 and represented graphic - ally in Figure 1 . This example is not meant to contribute to the substantive evidence on the topic , rather to illus - trate the methods . Further details on the dataset can be found in the original publication by Barone - Adesi et al . 2011 . 16 2 International Journal of Epidemiology , 2016 , Vol . 0 , No . 0 a t L ondon S c hoo l o f H yg i e n e & T r op i ca l M e d i c i n e on O c t ob e r 19 , 2016 h tt p : / / ij e . ox f o r d j ou r n a l s . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m components . This does not necessarily require the interven - tion to be introduced overnight but the period of imple - mentation should be well defined so that it can be considered separately . The implementation of the example intervention was very clear with a ban on smoking in public places throughout Italy from 10 January 2005 . 16 Where inter - ventions have a gradual roll - out , the implementation phase can be modelled as a gradual ( slope ) change ( see Step 2 ) . The outcome Outcomes may take various forms such as counts , continu - ous data or binary variables . ITS works best with short - term outcomes that are expected to change either relatively quickly after an intervention is implemented or after a clearly defined lag . ACEs , the outcome in the worked example , are a short - term outcome with rapid onset , and the authors of the study quote evidence suggesting that the acute effects of both active and passive smoking disappear quickly after the exposure is removed . 16 Other diseases associated with smoking , such as lung cancer , may have been less appropri - ate as the timing between intervention and outcome is much less clear and can be highly variable . In this situation it may be preferable to use an intermediate outcome such as smoking prevalence . 18 Data requirements Sequential measures of the outcome should be available both before and after the intervention . There are no fixed limits regarding the number of data points , as the power depends on various other factors including distribution of data points before and after the intervention , variability within the data , strength of effect , and the presence of con - founding effects such as seasonality . Zhang et al . con - ducted simulations with power calculations under different model parameters , and suggest that studies with few time points or with small expected effect sizes should be inter - preted with caution as they may be underpowered , and that similar simulations should be conducted a priori under such circumstances . 19 Power increases with the number of time points , but it is not always preferable to have more data points where historical trends have changed substan - tially , as this would not provide an accurate depiction of the current underlying trends . 20 It is therefore recom - mended that pre - intervention data are inspected visually . Power is also increased if the numbers of data points are equally distributed before and after the intervention , though this is often not practical . 19 Given the requirement for a relatively long time series , routine data are often most appropriate in ITS studies . As with all study designs , it is important to assess the quality of the data in terms of its validity and reliability . With routine data it is especially important to understand the potential impact of changes to data collection or recording , particularly when these coin - cide with the implementation of the intervention , as this could bias results . 12 The example dataset has 59 months of routine hospital admissions data with 600 - 1100 ACEs at each time point . The large number of time points and minimal variability within the data provides enough power to detect relatively small changes in the hospital admission rate . In practice , as is the case in the worked example , the ITS design is often used in the evaluation of ‘natural experiments’ occurring in real - world settings and is becoming ever more possible with the increasing availability and quality of routine data spanning before and after interventions . Step 2 : proposing the impact model Once an ITS design is chosen , the next step is to hypothesize how the intervention would impact on the outcome if it were effective , in particular whether the change will be a gradual change in the gradient of the trend , a change in the level or both , and whether the change will follow the inter - vention immediately or there will be a lag period before any effect is expected . Examples of some possible impact models are illustrated in Figure 2 . It is important that this decision is made a priori based on existing literature and knowledge of Figure 1 Scatter plot of example dataset . Standardized ( Std ) rate of ACE over time .

Where existing knowledge of the intervention is limited , selecting the most appropriate im - pact model can be difficult and may require exploratory analysis of alternative data . Relying on the outcome data to select the best impact model is discouraged as this increases the likelihood of an effect being detected due to random fluctuations or chance , and consequent artefactual conclu - sions on the effect of the intervention . Barone - Adesi et al . assumed a level change in ACEs occurring with no lag . This assumption was based on existing evidence suggesting that the acute cardiovascular risks from passive smoking disappear within a short time . 16 Step 3 : descriptive analysis As with all statistical analyses , initial summary statistics and plots should be undertaken to familiarize researchers with the data . This should include a scatter plot of the time series , as displayed in Figure 1 , which can help to iden - tify the underlying trend , seasonal patterns and outliers . More traditional descriptive analyses , such as summaries and bivariate comparisons between the out - come and potential time - varying confounders , as well as simple before - and - after comparisons , are recommended . Step 4 : regression analysis A minimum of three variables are required for an ITS analysis : i . T : the time elapsed since the start of the study in with the unit representing the frequency with which obser - vations are taken ( e . g . month or year ) ; ii . X t : a dummy variable indicating the pre - intervention period ( coded 0 ) or the post - intervention period ( coded 1 ) ; iii . Y t : the outcome at time t . In standard ITS analyses , the following segmented re - gression model is used : Y t ¼ b 0 þ b 1 T þ b 2 X t þ b 3 TX t where b 0 represents the baseline level at T ¼ 0 , b 1 is inter - preted as the change in outcome associated with a time Figure 2 Examples of impact models used in ITS ( a ) Level change ; ( b ) Slope change ; ( c ) Level and slope change ; ( d ) Slope change following a lag ; ( e ) Temporary level change ; ( f ) Temporary slope change leading to a level change . 4 International Journal of Epidemiology , 2016 , Vol . 0 , No . 0 a t L ondon S c hoo l o f H yg i e n e & T r op i ca l M e d i c i n e on O c t ob e r 19 , 2016 h tt p : / / ij e . ox f o r d j ou r n a l s . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m unit increase ( representing the underlying pre - intervention trend ) , b 2 is the level change following the intervention and b 3 indicates the slope change following the interven - tion ( using the interaction between time and intervention : TX t ) . The regression model above represents the impact model ( c ) in Figure 2 ; models ( a ) and ( b ) can easily be specified by excluding the terms b 3 TX t or b 2 X t , respect - ively . Impact models ( d ) - ( f ) require slightly more complex variable specifications ( Supplementary Appendix 5 , avail - able as Supplementary data at IJE online ) . In our example , T ; X and Y are shown in Table 1 . As is frequently the case in population health evaluations , here the outcome is a count and , without loss of generality , a Poisson regression model was used . Other regression mod - els can equally be used , such as ordinary least squares ( lin - ear ) regression for continuous outcomes , for example the duration of cycling trips in an ITS study looking at the im - pact of public transport strikes on usage of a bicycle share programme in London . 21 Most of the steps described in this tutorial remain the same for the analysis of other types of outcomes , unless specifically stated . Furthermore , the age - standardized population ( in person - years ) was included as an offset variable to convert the outcome into a rate and adjust for any potential changes in the population over time ( though this is not essential if the population is relatively stable over time , as in this case ) . Given that a level change model was hypothesized , the interaction term for the slope change is not required in the model . This model , shown using Stata code and R code in Supplementary Appendices 2 and 3 ( available as Supplementary data at IJE online ) , suggests that there is very strong evidence of a reduction in ACEs following the smoking ban , with a decrease of 11 % [ relative risk ( RR ) 0 . 894 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0 . 864 - 0 . 925 ; P < 0 . 001 ) as illustrated in Figure 3 . Step 5 : addressing methodological issues Whereas the basic model implemented so far provides an indication of the potential association between the inter - vention and the outcome , there are a number of distinctive issues with time series data that may need to be addressed in order to improve the robustness of the analysis . Seasonality Many diseases and other outcomes have a seasonal pattern and this is evident in the ACE data in Figure 1 . Seasonality can cause two problems : first , if there is an uneven distri - bution of months before and after the intervention , such as a higher proportion of winter months , this could bias the results , especially in the analysis of short series . Second , outcomes in one month tend to be more similar to those in Table 1 .

There are a range of methods for controlling for seasonal - ity and other long - term trends ; these include : a model stratified by the calendar month ( or other time period ) ; or using more complex functions such as Fourier terms ( pairs of sine and cosine functions ) ; or splines . Each of these methods is explained in more detail by Bhaskaran et al . 2013 . 22 Figure 4 shows the example analysis after adjust - ment for seasonality through a Fourier term , with results suggesting that the association is largely unaffected : ( RR : 0 . 885 ; 95 % CI 0 . 839 - 0 . 933 ; P < 0 . 001 ) . Time - varying confounders One of the strengths of ITS studies is that they are gener - ally unaffected by typical confounding variables which re - main fairly constant , such as population age distribution or socioeconomic status , as these only change relatively slowly over time and are normally taken into account when modelling the underlying long - term trend . Nevertheless , ITS can be affected by time - varying con - founders that change more rapidly . Seasonality can be con - sidered a time - varying confounder ; others may include levels of a particular infectious disease that is prone to out - breaks , weather events etc . Where such time - varying con - founders have been measured , they can be controlled for by including variables representing them in the regression model , as is commonly undertaken in other epidemiolo - gical analyses . A special category of time - varying confounders are other events that occur around the same time as the intervention and that potentially influence the outcome . These might include other simultaneous interven - tions targeting the same outcome , or risk factors for that outcome , or natural events that could affect the outcome . Potential time - varying confounders in the smoking ban study might include changes in diagnostic procedures for detecting ACEs , for example a new troponin test had been progressively implemented in Italy since 2000 , 23 or inter - ventions targeting other risk factors for cardiovascular dis - ease such as a healthy eating intervention . Use of controls and other more complex ITS designs Where time - varying confounders are either unmeasured or unknown , a range of design adaptations can be used to control for possible concurrent events including : adding a control group or control outcome which would not have been affected by the intervention ( known as a controlled interrupted time series ) ; using a multiple baseline design whereby the intervention is introduced in different loca - tions at different times ; or adding additional phases so that the intervention is first introduced and then withdrawn to establish whether withdrawal of the intervention leads to a reversal of the effect . These methods are described in more detail elsewhere . 12 , 13 , 15 , 24 Over - dispersion An assumption of the Poisson distribution is that the vari - ance is equal to the expected count . However , in analyses of real data , the variance frequently tends to be greater ( a phenomenon known as over - dispersion ) which would lead to incorrect estimation of the standard errors . A scaling ad - justment is therefore made to correct to the model to cor - rect this , detailed by Bhaskaran et al . and illustrated in Supplementary Appendices 2 and 3 ( available as Supplementary data at IJE online ) . 22 This issue does not apply for the analysis of continuous outcomes when a Gaussian distribution , including a residual error to be esti - mated , is assumed . In the example this widens the 95 % confidence interval marginally to 0 . 839 - 0 . 953 , yet there is still very strong evidence of an effect ( P ¼ 0 . 001 ) . Autocorrelation A second assumption of standard regression models is that observations are independent . This assumption is often violated in time series data because consecutive observa - tions tend to be more similar to one another than those that are further apart , a phenomenon known as autocorrel - ation . Fortunately , in many epidemiological data , autocor - relation is largely explained by other variables , in particular seasonality ( discussed above ) ; therefore , after controlling for these factors , residual autocorrelation is Figure 4 Model adjusted for seasonality .

Nevertheless , autocorrelation should al - ways be assessed by examining the plot of residuals and the partial autocorrelation function and , where data are normally distributed , conducting tests such as the Breusch - Godfrey test . 22 , 25 Where residual autocorrelation remains , this should be adjusted for using methods such as Prais re - gression or autoregressive integrated moving average ( ARIMA ) , described in more detail elsewhere . 26 , 27 There is very little evidence of autocorrelation in the worked ex - ample and even less after adjustment for seasonality ( Supplementary Appendices 2 and 3 , available as Supplementary data at IJE online ) . Further extensions Further extensions , as described by Bhaskaran et al . ( 2013 ) for environmental time series , and in more detail elsewhere , can also be applied to ITS studies , including : stratified ana - lyses according to potential effect - modifying variables ; increasing power by allowing different locations to have trends modelled individually rather than relying on the aggregated trend ; and modelling non - linear trends . 9 , 22 , 23 Step 6 : model - checking and sensitivity analyses A range of model - checking techniques have been described above including plotting residuals and partial autocorrel - ation functions . Furthermore , sensitivity analyses can be conducted to test the impact of varying a range of model assumptions , such as different lags , types of impact model or approaches to adjusting for seasonality . 11 , 22 Summary In this article we have introduced the key steps for readers undertaking an ITS study , including highlighting the main methodological considerations and how they may be ad - dressed . ITS analyses are one of the strongest evaluative de - signs when randomization is not possible ; furthermore , they often allow a more detailed assessment of the longitu - dinal impact of an intervention than may be possible with an RCT and , given that they are frequently undertaken in real - world settings , may have stronger external validity . Another important feature in ensuring that research gets translated into practice is that graphical and numerical presentation of results can be easily understood by those with little expert knowledge of statistical and epidemiolo - gical methods . Nevertheless , there are some important threats to the validity of ITS analyses , perhaps the most im - portant of which include the potential for the erroneous conclusion of intervention effectiveness due to data - driven model specification , and lack of control for time - varying confounders . It is therefore essential that any interpretations regarding the causal effect of any associ - ation are undertaken with caution and that some of the key steps to analysis highlighted in this article , such as a priori model specification and methodological extensions to control for confounders , are followed . With carefully planned analyses and handling of potential threats to valid - ity , ITS can provide valuable evidence about the effective - ness of health interventions .
