Here , we provide evidence of a role for myosin and dynein as motor proteins involved the yeast clathrin - independent pathway . 2 Abstract Most eukaryotic cells utilize clathrin - mediated endocytosis as well as multiple clathrin - independent pathways to internalize proteins and membranes . Although clathrin - mediated endocytosis has been studied extensively and many machinery proteins have been identified , clathrin - independent pathways remain poorly characterized by comparison . We previously identified the first known yeast clathrin - independent endocytic pathway , which relies on the actin - modulating GTPase Rho1 , the formin Bni1 and unbranched actin filaments , but does not require the clathrin coat or core clathrin machinery proteins . In this study , we sought to better understand clathrin - independent endocytosis in yeast by exploring the role of myosins as actin - based motors , since actin is required for endocytosis in yeast . We find that Myo2 , which transports secretory vesicles , organelles and microtubules along actin cables to sites of polarized growth , participates in clathrin - independent endocytosis . Unexpectedly , the ability of Myo2 to transport microtubule plus ends to the cell cortex appears to be required for its role in clathrin - independent endocytosis . In addition , dynein , dynactin and proteins involved in cortical microtubule capture are also required . Thus , our results suggest that interplay between actin and microtubules contributes to clathrin - independent internalization in yeast . Introduction 1 In eukaryotic cells , the plasma membrane ( PM ) plays important roles in regulation of signal 2 transduction , communication with the extracellular environment , and nutrient uptake . 3 Maintenance of PM composition and function relies on a balance between exocytosis for 4 delivery of membrane and proteins and on endocytosis for their internalization and removal from 5 the cell surface . Exocytic and endocytic transport allow the cell to control the complement of 6 proteins at the PM in order to amplify or attenuate responses to external cues , and permit 7 selective uptake of nutrients by regulating surface availability of transporters . Additionally , 8 endocytosis plays important quality control functions in mediating removal of damaged proteins 9 through internalization and targeting to the lysosome for degradation . 10 Endocytic mechanisms have been studied extensively for over sixty years , where electron 11 microscopy studies observed “bristle - coated” structures that were later identified as clathrin - 12 coated pits and vesicles ( Kanaseki and Kadota , 1969 ; Pearse , 1975 ; Roth and Porter , 1964 ) . 13 Subsequent studies have characterized clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) as the predominant 14 pathway for internalization in most eukaryotic cells ( Kaksonen and Roux , 2018 ) . CME is highly 15 conserved from yeast to human , and involves the action of more than 40 distinct proteins that 16 arrive in a highly ordered sequence of events in order to select and concentrate cargo at sites of 17 vesicle formation ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . These 18 proteins act in modules that correspond to discrete stages of clathrin - coated vesicle ( CCV ) 19 formation , beginning with an initiation phase in which adaptor proteins bind to endocytic cargos 20 at the PM as well as the assembling clathrin coat , effectively concentrating the cargo at a site of 21 CCV formation ( Howard et al . , 2002 ; Maldonado - Báez et al . , 2008 ; Newpher et al . , 2005 ; Reider 22 and Wendland , 2011 ; Reider et al . , 2009 ) . As the clathrin - coated site matures , endocytic 23 accessory and scaffolding proteins facilitate additional clathrin assembly , and recruit proteins 24 involved in later stages of vesicle formation , including actin - nucleating proteins in yeast required 25 for the force generation needed for membrane invagination ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Kaksonen et 26 al . , 2005 ; Sun et al . , 2006 ) . In the late stages of CME , scission effectors such as dynamin and 27 amphiphysins assist with membrane constriction at the neck of the budding vesicle , leading to 28 separation of the CCV from the cell surface ( Bliek et al . , 1993 ; Damke et al . , 1994 ; Kaksonen et 29 al . , 2005 ) . Finally , uncoating of the CCV permits recycling of endocytic machinery proteins and 30 fusion of the vesicle with downstream compartments ( Ungewickell et al . , 1995 ) . Studies have 31 4 shown that the modular nature of CME is well conserved , and genetic or pharmacological 32 perturbation of any stage in the process can reduce the efficiency of cargo internalization ( Goode 33 et al . , 2015 ; Kaksonen and Roux , 2018 ) . 34 Early studies of endocytosis also observed vesicle formation in the absence of a bristle coat 35 ( Anderson and Batten , 1983 ; Morris and Saelinger , 1983 ) , suggesting that multiple mechanisms 36 for internalization likely existed . Indeed , numerous clathrin - independent endocytic ( CIE ) 37 pathways have been identified across eukaryotes . These include a variety of mechanistically 38 distinct routes of internalization . For example , CIE encompasses phagocytic and macropinocytic 39 pathways that rely on membrane protrusion or ruffling , lipid ( typically cholesterol ) - enriched 40 membrane microdomains such as caveolae and clathrin - independent carriers and GPI - enriched 41 endocytic compartments ( CLIC / GEEC ) , and actin - dependent pathways relying on Arf - and Rho - 42 family small GTPases ( Howes et al . , 2010 ; Lamaze et al . , 2001 ; Mayor et al . , 2014 ; 43 Radhakrishna et al . , 1996 ; Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ; Sharma et al . , 2002 ) . In addition , recent 44 studies have demonstrated that ultrafast endocytosis at synaptic terminals is clathrin - 45 independent , and fast endophilin - mediated endocytosis ( FEME ) is a distinct CIE pathway that 46 relies on Endophilin A1 , dynein and microtubules for internalization of PM proteins ( Boucrot et 47 al . , 2015 ; Casamento and Boucrot , 2020 ; Watanabe et al . , 2013a ; Watanabe et al . , 2013b ) . 48 Despite the variety of CIE pathways that have been documented , our current understanding of 49 the molecular mechanisms governing any CIE pathway is poor in comparison to that of CME . 50 Reasons for this disparity may include the comparative lack of cargos that utilize CIE pathways 51 for entry , and a lack of genetically tractable model systems for studies of CIE . 52 We previously identified the first - known Saccharomyces cerevisiae CIE pathway using a 53 mutant strain lacking four monomeric clathrin - binding adaptor proteins : the epsins Ent1 and 54 Ent2 , and the AP180 / PICALM homologs Yap1801 and Yap1802 ( Prosser et al . , 2011 ) . Yeast 55 lacking these adaptors ( ent1 ∆ ent2 ∆ yap1801 ∆ yap1802 ∆ , also known as 4∆ ) have defective 56 CME as seen by retention of endocytic cargos at the PM , while any one full - length adaptor is 57 sufficient for endocytosis ( Maldonado - Báez et al . , 2008 ) . Although ENT1 and ENT2 constitute 58 an essential gene pair , expression of the phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate [ PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] - 59 binding epsin N - terminal homology ( ENTH domain ) of either gene is sufficient for viability but 60 not for their role in CME ( Aguilar et al . , 2006 ; Maldonado - Báez et al . , 2008 ; Wendland et al . , 61 1999 ) . Thus , 4∆ + ENTH1 cells expressing the ENTH domain of Ent1 have been a useful model 62 5 for studying deficits in CME ( Maldonado - Báez et al . , 2008 ; Prosser et al . , 2011 ) . Using this 63 strain to identify genes whose overexpression restored endocytic cargo internalization , we found 64 that high - copy expression of the cell wall stress sensor MID2 , the Rho1 guanine nucleotide 65 exchange factor ROM1 and the actin - modulating small GTPase RHO1 all enhanced 66 internalization of multiple endocytic cargos , and that their function did not require clathrin or the 67 major CME machinery proteins ( Prosser and Wendland , 2012 ; Prosser et al . , 2011 ) . The budding 68 yeast CIE pathway additionally requires the formin Bni1 , which generates unbranched actin 69 filaments independent of Arp2 / 3 , proteins in the polarisome complex which recruits and 70 activates Bni1 at sites of polarized growth , and proteins that stabilize unbranched actin filaments 71 such as the tropomyosins Tpm1 and Tpm2 . Further studies identified a - arrestins as cargo - 72 selective proteins that participate in CIE through mechanisms that are distinct from their 73 established roles in CME , as well as a dual role for the early - acting CME protein Syp1 , 74 suggesting that some proteins may contribute to multiple endocytic pathways ( Apel et al . , 2017 ; 75 Prosser et al . , 2015 ) . 76 Although yeast were thought to rely solely upon CME prior to our identification of the Rho1 - 77 dependent CIE pathway , other studies have also suggested that yeast do not strictly require CME 78 for cargo internalization . For example , Candida albicans can perform endocytosis in the absence 79 of functional clathrin and Arp2 / 3 ( Epp et al . , 2010 ; Epp et al . , 2013 ) , while endocytosis at the 80 cylindrical sides of cells in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe appears to depend on 81 the formin For3 ( Gachet and Hyams , 2005 ) . Overall , our mechanistic understanding of CIE 82 pathways in yeast , and indeed in any eukaryotic cell type , lags considerably behind that of CME 83 due at least in part to a lack of tools to characterize these pathways . 84 In this study , we extend our earlier findings by expanding the set of proteins required for CIE 85 in yeast . Since all endocytosis in yeast critically depends on actin polymerization , we specifically 86 focused on roles for myosins as actin - based motors and on myosin - interacting proteins . We find 87 that Myo2 , which transports organelles and other cellular structures along actin cables to sites of 88 polarized growth , is required for CIE . Unexpectedly , Myo2 - dependent transport of microtubule 89 plus ends , as well as dynein , dynactin , and proteins involved in cortical microtubule capture 90 participate in CIE , while transport of other structures is dispensable . Thus , interplay between 91 actin and microtubule cytoskeletons may play important roles in yeast CIE . 92 6 Results 93 The type V myosin Myo2 is required for clathrin - independent endocytosis 94 Our previous studies of CIE demonstrated a requirement for the formin Bni1 , which localizes 95 mainly to the bud tip and bud neck , where it promotes actin elongation at the barbed end of 96 unbranched filaments ( Evangelista et al . , 2001 ; Prosser et al . , 2011 ; Pruyne et al . , 2002 ; Sagot et 97 al . , 2002 ) . Additionally , we found that the tropomyosin Tpm1 , which stabilizes unbranched actin 98 filaments , was necessary for CIE . These filaments are bundled into actin cables that serve as 99 tracks for myosin - dependent delivery of material to sites of polarized growth ( Pruyne et al . , 100 1998 ) . Our initial findings underscored the role of actin in CIE , and prompted us to examine the 101 contribution of myosins as actin - based motors . Budding yeast possess five myosins : the type I 102 myosins Myo3 and Myo5 are involved in CME , the type II myosin Myo1 is involved in 103 constriction of the cytokinetic ring at the bud neck , and the type V myosins Myo2 and Myo4 104 transport proteins , vesicles , organelles , and mRNA along actin cables ( Bobola et al . , 1996 ; Geli 105 and Riezman , 1996 ; Pruyne et al . , 2004 ; Watts et al . , 1987 ) . Of these , Myo2 appears to play the 106 most prominent role in transport along unbranched actin cables ; thus , we focused on this protein 107 as a candidate motor involved in CIE . 108 MYO2 is an essential gene , and thus cannot be deleted ( Johnston et al . , 1991 ) . Instead , we 109 generated myo2 mutants with reduced processivity ( Schott et al . , 1999 ; Schott et al . , 2002 ) . The 110 lever arms of Myo2 permit movement along actin filaments , and contain IQ repeats that can be 111 truncated to generate motors that take shorter “steps” . Using full - length ( 6IQ ) or truncated ( 4IQ 112 or 2IQ ) mutants expressed as the sole source of Myo2 in WT , 4∆ + Ent1 ( with functional CME ) 113 and 4∆ + ENTH1 ( with impaired CME ) backgrounds , we examined localization of the pheromone 114 receptor Ste3 - GFP as an endocytic cargo . Ste3 is a seven - transmembrane receptor that is 115 normally transported to the PM in haploid MAT a cells , constitutively internalized via CME , and 116 delivered to the vacuole for degradation ( Davis et al . , 1993 ) . Under conditions where CME is 117 blocked , Ste3 is instead largely retained at the PM , with reduced transport to the vacuole 118 ( Maldonado - Báez et al . , 2008 ) . We previously found that expression of ROM1 from a high - copy 119 plasmid promoted clathrin - independent internalization of Ste3 - GFP in numerous CME - deficient 120 mutants including 4∆ + ENTH1 ( Prosser et al . , 2011 ) ; thus , we asked whether a reduction in 121 Myo2 processivity would impair ROM1 - dependent activation of CIE . In WT and 4∆ + Ent1 122 backgrounds transformed with empty vector , expression of Myo2 6IQ , Myo2 4IQ , or Myo2 2IQ 123 7 resulted in Ste3 - GFP localization primarily at the vacuole ( Fig . 1A ) . Thus , reduced Myo2 124 processivity does not appear to affect CME . In contrast , Ste3 - GFP showed increased retention at 125 the PM in 4∆ + ENTH1 cells transformed with empty vector and expressing full - length and 126 truncated Myo2 , which is consistent with defective endocytosis in 4∆ + ENTH1 cells . When these 127 4∆ + ENTH1 cells were instead transformed with high - copy ROM1 to promote CIE , we found that 128 Ste3 - GFP internalization and transport to the vacuole was improved in cells expressing full - 129 length Myo2 6IQ , but showed less or no improvement in cells expressing Myo2 4IQ or Myo2 2IQ 130 compared to equivalent empty vector - transformed cells . 131 We previously developed a quantitative method for assessing endocytic capacity in live yeast 132 cells by tagging the cytoplasmic tail of cargo proteins with superecliptic pHluorin , a pH - sensitive 133 variant of GFP ( Miesenböck et al . , 1998 ; Prosser et al . , 2010 ; Prosser et al . , 2016 ; 134 Sankaranarayanan et al . , 2000 ) . When the tail of the cargo is exposed to a neutral environment 135 such as the cytoplasm , the pHluorin tag is brightly fluorescent . In contrast , fluorescence is 136 quenched upon packaging of the tag into acidic environments , such as the intraluminal vesicles 137 within multivesicular bodies or the vacuole lumen . Measurement of steady - state , whole - cell 138 Ste3 - pHluorin intensity can thus reveal changes in endocytosis , as cells that efficiently 139 internalize Ste3 - pHluorin and target it to the vacuole are dim , while cells with defective 140 endocytosis retain the tagged protein at the PM and are comparatively bright ( Prosser et al . , 141 2010 ; Prosser et al . , 2016 ) . Using the same truncated Myo2 strains expressing genomically - 142 tagged Ste3 - pHluorin instead of GFP , we were able to quantitatively assess the effect of reduced 143 Myo2 processivity on CIE . As expected for cells with defective CME , Ste3 - pHluorin intensity in 144 empty vector - transformed 4∆ + ENTH1 cells expressing full - length Myo2 6IQ or truncated Myo2 4IQ 145 or Myo2 2IQ was significantly brighter than in the equivalent WT and 4∆ + Ent1 backgrounds ( Fig . 146 1B - D ) . In Myo2 6IQ - expressing 4∆ + ENTH1 cells , transformation with high - copy ROM1 partially 147 restored Ste3 - pHluorin internalization , as shown by a significant reduction in fluorescence 148 intensity compared to the same cells with empty vector ( Fig . 1B ) . In contrast , high - copy ROM1 149 failed to improve Ste3 - pHluorin internalization in 4∆ + ENTH1 cells expressing Myo2 4IQ ( Fig . 150 1C ) or Myo2 2IQ ( Fig . 1D ) , as these cells remained as bright as , or brighter than , equivalent empty 151 vector - transformed cells . Taken together , these data suggest that Myo2 processivity is required 152 for CIE in yeast . 153 8 To examine the potential contribution of other myosins to CIE , we generated single myo1 ∆ 154 and myo4 ∆ deletions in WT , 4∆ + Ent1 and 4∆ + ENTH1 backgrounds expressing Ste3 - GFP . Both 155 myo1 ∆ and myo4 ∆ did not alter vacuolar Ste3 - GFP localization in WT and 4∆ + Ent1 156 backgrounds transformed with empty vector , suggesting that neither gene is required for cargo 157 internalization when CME is functional ( Supplementary Fig . S1A - B ) . Whereas Ste3 - GFP was 158 partially retained at the PM in empty vector - transformed myo1 ∆ or myo4 ∆ 4∆ + ENTH1 cells , 159 transformation with high - copy ROM1 reduced cell surface retention and increased vacuole 160 localization in both cases , suggesting that neither Myo1 nor Myo4 is required for CIE . 161 Since Myo3 and Myo5 play overlapping roles in force generation at cortical actin patches in 162 yeast , deletion of both genes simultaneously is required to block CME ( Geli and Riezman , 163 1996 ) . Consistent with this finding , myo3 ∆ myo5 ∆ cells transformed with empty vector showed a 164 severe retention of Ste3 - GFP at the plasma membrane , with cargo fluorescence virtually 165 undetectable in the vacuole ( Supplementary Fig . S1C - D ) . This defect could be complemented by 166 low - copy expression of MYO5 , which restored vacuolar Ste3 - GFP localization and reduced cell 167 surface retention of the cargo . In contrast , high - copy YAP1801 , which restored endocytosis in 168 4∆ + ENTH1 cells , had no effect on cargo internalization in myo3 ∆ myo5 ∆ ( Prosser et al . , 2011 ) . 169 Although we predicted that high - copy ROM1 would promote CIE in myo3 ∆ myo5 ∆ cells since 170 these myosins are known to function in CME , we unexpectedly found that Ste3 - GFP was 171 strongly retained at the PM . However , close examination of these cells revealed dim vacuolar 172 fluorescence with high - copy ROM1 , but not in cells transformed with empty vector or YAP1801 173 ( Supplementary Fig . 1C - D ) . The limited ability of Rom1 to promote Ste3 internalization in 174 myo3 ∆ myo5 ∆ cells might be explained by previous studies showing that actin cable morphology 175 is severely altered in this strain ( Anderson et al . , 1998 ; Goodson et al . , 1996 ) . Indeed , phalloidin 176 staining of myo3 ∆ myo5 ∆ cells with empty vector revealed numerous actin patches , but no 177 obvious actin cable structures ( Supplementary Fig . 1E ) . While low - copy MYO5 restored actin 178 cables , they remained absent in cells with high - copy YAP1801 or ROM1 . Thus , Myo3 and Myo5 179 may play roles in CIE , but their role might be explained by an indirect effect on actin cable 180 morphology . Taken together , these data suggest that Myo2 processivity contributes to CIE , while 181 other myosins may play less prominent roles . 182 183 184 9 Myo2 - dependent transport of microtubules is required for CIE 185 Previous studies showed that Myo2 plays a critical role in mother - to - bud transport of 186 secretory vesicles , mitochondria , vacuoles , peroxisomes , and microtubules ( Beach et al . , 2000 ; 187 Boldogh et al . , 2004 ; Fagarasanu et al . , 2005 ; Fagarasanu et al . , 2009 ; Ishikawa et al . , 2003 ; 188 Pruyne et al . , 1998 ; Schott et al . , 1999 ) . To achieve this , the cargo - binding domain ( CBD ) of 189 Myo2 interacts with organelle - specific adaptors that link each structure to the motor for transport 190 ( Eves et al . , 2012 ; Fagarasanu et al . , 2009 ; Jin et al . , 2011 ; Lipatova et al . , 2008 ; Pashkova et al . , 191 2006 ) . Structure - function analysis of the CBD revealed unique surface patches that associate 192 with Myo2 adaptors , and mutations within these patches result in selective loss of adaptor 193 binding and organelle transport ( Eves et al . , 2012 ; Pashkova et al . , 2006 ) . To assess which 194 functions are necessary for CIE , we expressed CBD mutants from the endogenous MYO2 locus 195 as the sole source of Myo2 in WT , 4∆ + Ent1 and 4∆ + ENTH1 backgrounds . We focused on five 196 point mutants , each defective in one transport function : D1297N ( loss of Vac17 binding and 197 vacuole transport ) ; K1312A ( loss of Mmr1 binding and mitochondrial transport ) ; K1408A ( loss 198 of Kar9 binding and microtubule plus end transport ) ; Q1447R ( deficient in binding the Rab 199 GTPases Ypt31 , Ypt32 , Ypt11 and Sec4 , reduction in secretory vesicle transport ) ; and E1484A 200 ( loss of Inp2 binding and peroxisome transport ; ( Eves et al . , 2012 ; Fagarasanu et al . , 2009 ; 201 Ishikawa et al . , 2003 ; Lipatova et al . , 2008 ; Pashkova et al . , 2006 ) ) . As seen in Fig . 2A , 202 expression of any of these mutants in WT or 4∆ + Ent1 cells transformed with empty vector did 203 not alter vacuolar localization of Ste3 - GFP compared to cells with wild - type Myo2 , suggesting 204 that none of these Myo2 functions impact CME . As expected for 4∆ + ENTH1 cells expressing 205 Myo2 CBD mutants and transformed with empty vector , Ste3 - GFP showed retention at the PM . 206 Expression of high - copy ROM1 improved Ste3 - GFP internalization and vacuolar delivery in 207 4∆ + ENTH1 cells expressing wild - type Myo2 and all of the CBD mutants except for except for 208 the microtubule transport - deficient mutant , Myo2 K1408A . 209 When we analyzed endocytic capacity in the same set of strains expressing Ste3 - pHluorin , 210 we observed quantitative trends that agreed with localization patterns of Ste3 - GFP ( Fig . 2B - G ) . 211 In WT and 4∆ + Ent1 backgrounds with functional CME , whole - cell intensity of Ste3 - pHluorin 212 was similarly low regardless of whether the cells expressed wild - type Myo2 or any of the CBD 213 mutants . Ste3 - pHluorin intensity was significantly higher in all empty vector - transformed 214 4∆ + ENTH1 strains compared to their Myo2 CBD - matched control WT and 4∆ + Ent1 215 10 background strains , as expected for cells with defective CME . Transformation of 4∆ + ENTH1 216 cells expressing wild - type Myo2 or the D1297N , K1312A , Q1447R , or E1484A CBD mutants 217 significantly improved Ste3 - pHluorin internalization , as seen by lower fluorescence intensity 218 compared to empty vector - transformed 4∆ + ENTH1 cells ( Fig . 2B - D and F - G ) . In contrast , 219 Myo2 K1408A 4∆ + ENTH1 cells transformed with high - copy ROM1 were significantly brighter 220 than empty vector - transformed cells , suggesting a possible worsening of the endocytic defect 221 ( Fig . 2E ) . Interestingly , high - copy ROM1 showed varying degrees of rescue in the other CBD 222 mutants : it fully rescued Ste3 - pHluorin internalization to WT or 4∆ + Ent1 levels in cells 223 expressing Myo2 WT , D1297N and Q1447R , but only partially improved internalization to 224 levels that remained higher than for WT or 4∆ + Ent1 in cells expressing Myo2 K1312A or 225 Myo2 E1484A . Overall , the ability of Myo2 to transport microtubule plus ends appears to be 226 required for CIE , while other motor functions appear to be dispensable . 227 228 Links between Myo2 and microtubule plus ends are required for CIE 229 Our finding that microtubule plus end transport contributes to CIE was unexpected because 230 the yeast microtubule cytoskeleton is thought to play limited roles in membrane traffic ; however , 231 a previous study implicated microtubules and the plus - end tracking protein Bik1 in trafficking of 232 the v - SNARE Snc1 ( Boscheron et al . , 2016 ) . tub1 - Glu and bik1 ∆ mutations caused Snc1 233 mislocalization reminiscent of defective endocytosis that were suppressed by Rho1 activation ; 234 thus , we further examined links between Myo2 and microtubule plus end - binding proteins . The 235 Myo2 CBD binds Kar9 , the yeast homolog of adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ; ( Beach et al . , 236 2000 ) ) . In turn , Kar9 associates with the plus end - binding protein Bim1 , which is homologous to 237 mammalian EB1 . Myo2 , Kar9 and Bim1 function together in a pathway required for cortical 238 microtubule ( cMT ) capture which is partially redundant with a second pathway involving 239 dynein , Bik1 ( homolog of CLIP - 170 ) and Num1 ( Adames and Cooper , 2000 ; Farkasovsky and 240 Küntzel , 2001 ; Lee et al . , 2000 ; Miller and Rose , 1998 ; Miller et al . , 2000 ; Yin et al . , 2000 ) . 241 Kar9 and Bim1 both additionally associate with Bik1 , suggesting the possibility of cross - talk 242 between these pathways ( Moore et al . , 2006 ) . 243 To begin examining the role of these plus end - binding proteins in CIE , we generated kar9 ∆ , 244 bim1 ∆ and bik1 ∆ mutants in WT , 4∆ + Ent1 and 4∆ + ENTH1 backgrounds expressing Ste3 - GFP 245 or Ste3 - pHluorin . Each of the plus end transport - regulating proteins did not alter vacuolar 246 11 delivery of Ste3 - GFP in empty vector - transformed WT and 4∆ + Ent1 backgrounds compared to 247 equivalent cells with no modification to plus end - binding genes ( Fig . 3A ) . As expected , Ste3 - 248 GFP was partially retained at the PM in 4∆ + ENTH1 cells as well as kar9 ∆ , bim1 ∆ , and bik1 ∆ 249 4∆ + ENTH1 cells with empty vector . High - copy ROM1 appeared to improve Ste3 - GFP 250 internalization in 4∆ + ENTH1 and bik1 ∆ 4∆ + ENTH1 cells , but had little effect in kar9 ∆ or 251 bim1 ∆ 4∆ + ENTH1 cells . When we quantified Ste3 - pHluorin intensity in these backgrounds , we 252 found that WT and 4∆ + Ent1 backgrounds were similarly dim in each case , while 4∆ + ENTH1 253 backgrounds were significantly brighter in comparison ( Fig . 3B - E ) . In 4∆ + ENTH1 cells with no 254 modification to plus - end binding genes , high - copy ROM1 fully restored Ste3 - pHluorin 255 internalization to WT or 4∆ + Ent1 levels ( Fig . 3B ) . In contrast , high - copy ROM1 did not reduce 256 Ste3 - pHluorin intensity in kar9 ∆ 4∆ + ENTH1 cells compared to empty vector , suggesting that 257 the plus end - binding complex is required for CIE ( Fig . 3C ) . Ste3 - pHluorin internalization was 258 partially restored in bim1 ∆ and bik1 ∆ 4∆ + ENTH1 cells with high - copy ROM1 , where 259 fluorescence intensity was significantly lower than cells with empty vector , suggesting that 260 neither gene is required for CIE ( Fig . 3D - E ) . This was unexpected , as ROM1 appeared to 261 improve Ste3 - GFP internalization in bik1 ∆ , but not bim1 ∆ 4∆ + ENTH1 cells ( Fig . 3A ) . Notably , 262 the decrease in Ste3 - pHluorin intensity for bim1 ∆ 4∆ + ENTH1 cells expressing high - copy ROM1 263 versus empty vector ( 14 . 6 % reduction ) was much smaller than that of bik1 ∆ 4∆ + ENTH1 cells 264 ( 47 . 4 % reduction ) , suggesting a greater effect for bim1 ∆ than for bik1 ∆ . Combined with the PM 265 retention of Ste3 - GFP in bim1 ∆ 4∆ + ENTH1 cells , it is thus possible that Bik1 plays a weaker 266 role in CIE , or that the two proteins share overlapping function through their function in distinct 267 cMT capture pathways or interactions with Kar9 . Unfortunately , bim1 ∆ bik1 ∆ cells are inviable , 268 so we were unable to directly test this possibility ( Schwartz et al . , 1997 ) . Nonetheless , these data 269 suggest that Kar9 and microtubule plus end - binding proteins contribute to CIE . 270 271 Stability of cytoplasmic microtubules contributes to CIE 272 Given our observations that Myo2 - and Kar9 - dependent transport of microtubules is required 273 for CIE in yeast , we decided to more directly test the involvement of microtubules in this 274 process . We previously showed that actin is required for CIE in addition to its established role in 275 CME by treating cells with the actin - depolymerizing drug Latrunculin A ( LatA ; ( Prosser et al . , 276 2011 ) ) . Using WT , 4∆ + Ent1 and 4∆ + ENTH1 cells transformed with empty vector , as well as 277 12 4∆ + ENTH1 cells with high - copy ROM1 , we examined Ste3 - GFP localization in vehicle 278 ( DMSO ) , LatA , and nocodazole - treated cells to determine whether microtubule 279 depolymerization would also affect Rom1 - dependent internalization ( Fig . 4 ) . As seen previously , 280 two - hour treatment with LatA potently inhibited endocytosis in all strains , where Ste3 - GFP was 281 almost completely retained at the PM ( Prosser et al . , 2011 ) . In contrast , DMSO - treated controls 282 showed the expected pattern of primarily vacuolar Ste3 - GFP in WT and 4∆ + Ent1 cells with 283 empty vector , prominent PM retention in 4∆ + ENTH1 cells with empty vector , and improved 284 internalization in 4∆ + ENTH1 with high - copy ROM1 . Ste3 - GFP showed similar localization in 285 nocodazole - and DMSO - treatment conditions for WT , 4∆ + Ent1 and 4∆ + ENTH1 cells with 286 empty vector . In contrast , 4∆ + ENTH1 cells with high - copy ROM1 appeared to show weaker 287 Ste3 - GFP internalization with nocodazole - treatment compared to DMSO . Thus , microtubules 288 appear to participate in CIE . 289 Since force must be exerted at the PM for endocytosis to occur , we further reasoned that 290 stability of cytoplasmic microtubules is required for CIE . The kinesin - related motors Kip2 and 291 Kip3 play opposing roles in regulating cytoplasmic microtubule stabilization , where Kip2 292 inhibits catastrophe and promotes microtubule polymerization , while Kip3 destabilizes 293 microtubules ( Miller et al . , 1998 ) . Thus , kip2 ∆ results in destabilization of cytoplasmic 294 microtubules , while kip3 ∆ causes their hyper - stabilization . We generated kip2 ∆ and kip3 ∆ strains 295 in WT , 4∆ + Ent1 and 4∆ + ENTH1 backgrounds , and used these to examine Ste3 - GFP 296 localization . Neither kip2 ∆ nor kip3 ∆ altered the predominantly vacuolar localization of Ste3 - 297 GFP in WT or 4∆ + Ent1 backgrounds with empty vector , as expected for strains with functional 298 CME ( Fig . 5A ) . In kip2 ∆ 4∆ + ENTH1 cells with empty vector , Ste3 - GFP largely accumulated at 299 the PM , consistent with a block in CME . Transformation of kip2 ∆ 4∆ + ENTH1 cells with high - 300 copy ROM1 did not noticeably improve Ste3 - GFP internalization . Interestingly , empty vector - 301 transformed kip3 ∆ 4∆ + ENTH1 cells showed lower PM accumulation of Ste3 - GFP with 302 correspondingly higher vacuolar delivery , and high - copy ROM1 gave similar distribution of the 303 cargo . These findings correlate with microtubule stability : we were unable to observe 304 cytoplasmic microtubules in kip2 ∆ cells expressing GFP - Tub1 compared to WT cells ; in 305 contrast , kip3 ∆ cells showed exaggerated cytoplasmic microtubules that appeared to wrap around 306 the cell cortex ( Fig . 5B ) . 307 13 Quantification of Ste3 - pHluorin intensity in kip2 ∆ and kip3 ∆ strains supported our 308 observations of Ste3 - GFP localization . For kip2 ∆ or kip2 ∆ 4∆ + Ent1 cells with empty vector , 309 whole - cell Ste3 - pHluorin intensity was similarly low , while kip2 ∆ 4∆ + ENTH1 cells with empty 310 vector were significantly brighter ( Fig . 5C ) . Consistent with a requirement for Kip2 in CIE , 311 transformation of kip2 ∆ 4∆ + ENTH1 cells with high - copy ROM1 failed to improve 312 internalization , as shown by similar brightness to kip2 ∆ 4∆ + ENTH1 cells with empty vector . 313 Deletion of KIP3 in 4∆ + ENTH1 cells with empty vector also resulted in a small , but significant 314 increase in Ste3 - pHluorin intensity compared to kip3 ∆ or kip3 ∆ 4∆ + Ent1 cells ( Fig . 5D ) ; 315 however , this increase ( 33 . 7 % for kip3 ∆ 4∆ + ENTH1 compared to kip3 ∆ with empty vector ) was 316 much smaller than seen when comparing kip2 ∆ to kip2 ∆ 4∆ + ENTH1 with empty vector ( 99 . 2 % 317 increase ) . Transformation of kip3 ∆ 4∆ + ENTH1 cells with high - copy ROM1 resulted in Ste3 - 318 pHluorin intensity levels that were indistinguishable from kip3 ∆ , kip3 ∆ 4∆ + Ent1 , or kip3 ∆ 319 4∆ + ENTH1 cells with empty vector . Taken together , these experiments demonstrate that 320 stability of cytoplasmic microtubules is required for CIE , and that their stabilization may 321 increase clathrin - independent endocytosis in yeast . 322 323 Dynein and dynactin are required for CIE in yeast 324 Our findings that cytoplasmic microtubules , and Myo2 - dependent transport of microtubule 325 plus ends , contribute to CIE prompted us next to examine whether the minus end - directed 326 microtubule motor dynein and its cofactor dynactin are also needed . As microtubule plus ends 327 are transported along actin cables , dynein and dynactin are targeted to the plus end through an 328 interaction between the dynein heavy chain ( Dyn1 ) and Pac1 ( homolog of the mammalian 329 lissencephaly protein , LIS1 ) , which in turn binds to Bik1 ( Sheeman et al . , 2003 ) . To explore the 330 role of this protein module in CIE , we focused on four deletions : dyn1 ∆ ( dynein heavy chain ) 331 and pac11 ∆ ( dynein intermediate chain ) which cause a loss of dynein function , nip100 ∆ 332 ( dynactin p150 Glued subunit ) which causes a loss of dynactin function , and pac1 ∆ which disrupts 333 plus end - tracking of dynein / dynactin ( Geiser et al . , 1997 ; Sheeman et al . , 2003 ) . We generated 334 each of these deletions in WT , 4∆ + Ent1 , and 4∆ + ENTH1 backgrounds , and subsequently 335 examined Ste3 - GFP localization and the effect of high - copy ROM1 on Ste3 internalization in the 336 CME - defective 4∆ + ENTH1 strain . As expected for each WT and 4∆ + Ent1 background 337 transformed with empty vector , Ste3 - GFP was efficiently delivered to the vacuole , indicating 338 14 that loss of dynein / dynactin function or plus end - tracking are not required for cargo 339 internalization when CME is functional ( Fig . 6A ) . In dyn1 ∆ , pac11 ∆ , nip100 ∆ , and pac1 ∆ 340 4∆ + ENTH1 cells transformed with empty vector , Ste3 - GFP localized prominently at the PM , 341 indicating a reduction in internalization . When each of the corresponding 4∆ + ENTH1 342 backgrounds were instead transformed with high - copy ROM1 , Ste3 - GFP retention at the PM was 343 similar to cells with empty vector . Quantification of Ste3 - pHluorin intensity confirmed the 344 endocytic effects observed with Ste3 - GFP : dyn1 ∆ , pac11 ∆ , nip100 ∆ , and pac1 ∆ in WT and 345 4∆ + Ent1 backgrounds with empty vector had similarly low fluorescence intensity , which was 346 significantly higher in the 4∆ + ENTH1 background ( Fig . 6B - E ) . Transformation of dyn1 ∆ , 347 pac11 ∆ , nip100 ∆ , and pac1 ∆ 4∆ + ENTH1 cells with high - copy ROM1 failed to reduce the 348 elevated Ste3 - pHluorin intensity , indicating that Rom1 was no longer able to improve cargo 349 internalization in the absence of dynein / dynactin or Pac1 function . 350 351 Cortical microtubule capture is required for CIE in yeast 352 Once Myo2 delivers microtubule plus end to the cell cortex , an offloading event occurs in 353 which the dynein intermediate chain Pac11 ( in complex with microtubules ) associates with 354 Num1 , a protein that forms stable patches at the cell cortex ( Lee et al . , 2003 ; Lee et al . , 2005 ) . 355 These patches are sites of cMT anchoring , where Num1 binding to Pac11 leads to dynein 356 activation by relieving the inhibitory activity of Pac1 . Activated dynein is a minus end - directed 357 motor , which pulls on the cytoplasmic microtubule to position the nucleus at the neck of large - 358 budded cells in preparation for mitosis ( Kahana et al . , 1998 ) . Since our data indicate that 359 cytoplasmic microtubules and dynein / dynactin are involved in CIE , we generated num1 ∆ strains 360 to test whether cMT anchoring is also required . As shown in in Fig . 7A , num1 ∆ did not affect 361 vacuolar Ste3 - GFP delivery in WT and 4∆ + Ent1 backgrounds transformed with empty vector , 362 indicating that Num1 is not required for cargo internalization when CME is functional . In 363 contrast , Ste3 - GFP was prominently retained at the plasma membrane in num1 ∆ 4∆ + ENTH1 364 cells with empty vector , and this defective localization was not corrected by transformation with 365 high - copy ROM1 . Similarly , quantification of Ste3 - pHluorin intensity in num1 ∆ cells showed 366 low fluorescence in WT and 4∆ + Ent1 backgrounds with empty vector , in agreement with 367 vacuolar localization seen for Ste3 - GFP ( Fig . 7B ) . As expected , Ste3 - pHluorin intensity was 368 significantly higher in num1 ∆ 4∆ + ENTH1 cells with empty vector . Transformation of num1 ∆ 369 15 4∆ + ENTH1 cells with high - copy ROM1 failed to improve the elevated fluorescence intensity of 370 Ste3 - pHluorin compared to empty vector ; in fact , ROM1 - transformed cells were significantly 371 brighter than the vector control in num1 ∆ 4∆ + ENTH1 cells , similar to myo2 K1408A 4∆ + ENTH1 372 cells defective in Myo2 - dependent microtubule transport ( Fig . 2E ) . Thus , cMT capture and 373 anchoring , in addition to transport of cytoplasmic microtubules , appears to be required for CIE . 374 In our examination of the role of microtubules and cMT capture machinery in CIE , we 375 considered the possibility that mitotic spindle positioning may be altered in cells with defective 376 CME or that strains with defective CIE may share a spindle orientation defect . Thus , we 377 generated strains with a chromosomal integration of GFP - TUB1 , expressed from the TUB1 378 promoter , at the LYS2 gene locus . WT , 4∆ + Ent1 and 4∆ + ENTH1 cells with empty vector or 379 high - copy ROM1 all had similar microtubule morphologies in unbudded and budded cells , with 380 no obvious spindle misorientation , suggesting that inhibition of CME or overexpression of 381 ROM1 did not alter the microtubule cytoskeleton ( Supplementary Fig . S2A ) . Additionally , we 382 examined GFP - Tub1 in a variety of other strains harboring deletions in cMT transport and 383 capture . With these strains , we observed spindle orientation similar to WT cells in some cases 384 ( kar9 ∆ , bim1 ∆ , bik1 ∆ and pac1 ∆ ) , but a severe spindle misalignment in cells with defective 385 dynein , dynactin or cMT anchoring ( dyn1 ∆ , pac11 ∆ , nip100 ∆ and num1 ∆ ; Supplementary Fig . 386 S2B ) . All spindle orientation phenotypes were similar when these mutations were generated in 387 the 4∆ + Ent1 and 4∆ + ENTH1 backgrounds ( data not shown ) . Our observations agree with 388 numerous prior studies showing spindle misalignment in many mutants with defective cMT 389 capture and nuclear positioning ( Eshel et al . , 1993 ; Farkasovsky and Küntzel , 1995 ; Kahana et 390 al . , 1998 ; Miller and Rose , 1998 ; Stuchell - Brereton et al . , 2011 ) . Notably , spindle misalignment 391 is not necessarily required for a role of these proteins in CIE , since kar9 ∆ and pac1 ∆ , which had 392 normal spindle orientation , both prevented Rom1 - dependent activation of CIE in 4∆ + ENTH1 393 cells ( Anderson et al . , 2022 ; Lee et al . , 2003 ) . Moreover , we previously showed that Bni1 is 394 required downstream of Rho1 for CIE , and we did not observe spindle orientation defects in 395 bni1 ∆ 4∆ + ENTH1 cells ( data not shown ) . 396 16 Discussion 397 Although a variety of clathrin - independent endocytic pathways have now been observed in 398 most eukaryotes , the molecular mechanisms governing CIE have remained elusive compared to 399 our understanding of CME . Many aspects of CIE have not yet been addressed in detail , due in 400 part to the relatively small number of proteins implicated in CIE and a lack of tools to study 401 these pathways . In turn , this leaves open questions about ( 1 ) the degree of overlap in protein 402 machinery between different CIE pathways or between CME and CIE , ( 2 ) the relative level of 403 complexity required to generate clathrin - coated and clathrin - independent vesicles , ( 3 ) 404 mechanisms for generating the force required for membrane deformation , curvature stabilization 405 and vesicle scission in the absence of a clathrin coat , ( 4 ) how cells select and sort cargo into 406 different endocytic pathways , and ( 5 ) the relative contribution of CME and CIE to cargo and 407 membrane internalization . 408 Our previous discovery of the first CIE pathway observed in budding yeast has provided us 409 with a genetically tractable system to begin answering these questions ( Prosser et al . , 2011 ) . 410 Earlier studies identified a signaling cascade involving the cell wall stress sensor Mid2 , the Rho1 411 GEFs Rom1 and Rom2 , the Rho1 GTPase and its effector Bni1 ( along with Bni1 - recruiting and - 412 activating proteins in the polarisome ) as central components of CIE in yeast . Moreover , the 413 early - acting CME machinery protein Syp1 contributes to both clathrin - dependent and clathrin - 414 independent internalization of cargos such as the di - and tri - peptide transporter Ptr2 ( Apel et al . , 415 2017 ) . Syp1 contains an N - terminal Fes / CIP4 homology - Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs ( F - BAR ) 416 domain involved in sensing and inducing membrane curvature and a cargo - binding µ - homology 417 domain ( µHD ) at its C - terminus , both of which are required for localization to and function at 418 CME sites ( Reider et al . , 2009 ) . Syp1 directly binds to and promotes internalization of Mid2 , 419 likely through CME since we have not observed Mid2 internalization under conditions where 420 CIE promotes uptake of Ste3 or other cargos ( D . Prosser , unpublished results ) ; thus , it is unclear 421 whether Syp1 plays mechanistically similar roles in CME and CIE . Finally , a - arrestins , which 422 act as cargo - selective adaptors for the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 during CME , also participate in CIE 423 through interactions with proteins such as Rom2 and Rho1 ( Prosser et al . , 2015 ) . Rsp5 and its 424 interaction with a - arrestins is not required for CIE , even though the a - arrestins retain their 425 cargo - selective roles in directing proteins to CIE . While the majority of yeast CME proteins 426 17 tested to date are not required for CIE , these prior findings demonstrate that limited sets of 427 proteins participate in both pathways . 428 The current study expands our understanding of CIE in yeast by identifying additional 429 components of the pathway : the type V myosin Myo2 , microtubules and plus end - binding 430 proteins ( Kar9 , and possibly Bim1 and Bik1 ) , regulators of cytoplasmic microtubule stability 431 ( Kip2 and Kip3 ) , cMT capture ( Num1 ) , and dynein / dynactin ( Dyn1 , Pac11 and Nip100 ; Fig . 8 ) . 432 None of these proteins have been previously implicated in CME to our knowledge , and 433 membrane trafficking roles for microtubules or microtubule - based motors remain largely 434 undefined in yeast . Notably , tubulin and the plus end - tracking protein Bik1 were reported to play 435 roles in trafficking of the v - SNARE Snc1 , where mutations in Tub1 or Bik1 caused PM 436 accumulation of Snc1 reminiscent of the endocytosis - defective Snc1 end - mutant ( Boscheron et al . , 437 2016 ; Lewis et al . , 2000 ) . Importantly , Snc1 mislocalization in tub1 - Glu and bik1 ∆ mutants was 438 corrected by expression of constitutively active Rho1 G19V . This suggests a possible role for CIE 439 in the observed effects , although contributions of CME cannot be ruled out . In our study , Bik1 440 was not required for CIE of Ste3 - GFP ( Fig . 3 ) , which might be explained by overlapping 441 functions with Bim1 or other components of microtubule plus end - binding or tracking . 442 Alternatively , specific endocytic cargos may physically associate with different proteins 443 involved in CIE and / or microtubule regulation to allow recruitment into an endocytic carrier , 444 either directly or indirectly through proteins such as a - arrestins . For example , the a - arrestin 445 Bul2 associates with the dynactin subunit Nip100 , which may allow direct links between cargos 446 and microtubule - based transport machinery ( Wang et al . , 2012 ) . As we do not yet understand 447 how cargo is selected into CIE pathways , identifying proteins that serve as CIE cargo - selective 448 adaptors will be an interesting future direction . 449 Separate from the role of Bik1 and tubulin in Snc1 trafficking , another study identified a role 450 for the dynein light chain - family protein Tda2 in CME ( Farrell et al . , 2017 ) . Rather than acting 451 with microtubules and dynein , this novel role for Tda2 appears to rely on formation of a complex 452 with Aim21 and the actin - capping proteins Cap1 and Cap2 , leading to association with the CME 453 protein Bbc1 and subsequent regulation of Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization at cortical 454 actin patches . Although these findings do not rule out a relationship between Tda2 and 455 microtubules distinct from its contribution to CME , it is unlikely that Tda2 participates in CIE , 456 18 since high - copy ROM1 promotes Ste3 - GFP internalization in aim21 ∆ 4∆ + ENTH1 cells ( D . 457 Prosser , unpublished results ) . 458 The degree of similarity between yeast and mammalian CIE remains a major unresolved 459 question , in large part because of the limited set of proteins linked to any CIE pathway . As we 460 add to the number of proteins involved in yeast CIE , it is tempting to speculate on how these 461 relate to pathways in higher eukaryotes . Studies of several different pathways have identified 462 roles for homologs of proteins involved in yeast CIE . For example , clathrin - independent ultrafast 463 endocytosis occurs at synapses in mammals and C . elegans , and requires actin polymerization 464 and formins ( Bni1 in yeast ; ( Soykan et al . , 2017 ; Watanabe et al . , 2013a ; Watanabe et al . , 465 2013b ) ) . Additionally , fast endophilin - mediated endocytosis ( FEME ) utilizes microtubules and 466 dynein for inward transport of tubular endocytic carriers , as does clathrin - independent 467 internalization of cholera toxin ( Boucrot et al . , 2015 ; Casamento and Boucrot , 2020 ; Day et al . , 468 2015 ; Ferreira et al . , 2021 ; Watanabe and Boucrot , 2017 ) . Microtubules and the plus end - binding 469 protein EB1 ( Bim1 in yeast ) contribute to endocytosis in Drosophila oocytes , although roles for 470 clathrin in this process have not been addressed ( Sanghavi et al . , 2012 ) . Lastly , RhoA and 471 integrins ( similar to yeast Rho1 and Mid2 , respectively ) are required for clathrin - independent 472 compensatory endocytosis in bladder umbrella cells and for internalization of the IL - 2 receptor 473 ( Khandelwal et al . , 2010 ; Lamaze et al . , 2001 ) . While additional parallels likely exist , these 474 suggest that the protein machinery involved in a variety of CIE pathways may at least partially 475 overlap . Alternatively , yeast CIE may represent an ancestral form of clathrin - independent 476 endocytosis that has branched or diverged during evolution . It will be interesting to test whether 477 additional components of the yeast pathway contribute to CIE mechanisms in other eukaryotes , 478 and our ability to identify additional CIE components using yeast genetics has the potential to 479 rapidly expand our understanding of these pathways . 480 With an increase in our understanding of CIE pathways and the protein machinery that 481 enables clathrin - independent internalization , insights into relationships between CIE and human 482 diseases may also emerge . To date , homologs of several yeast CIE proteins have been linked to 483 disease . For example , mutations in diaphanous - related formins , which are homologous to yeast 484 Bni1 , are associated with microcephaly and related developmental disorders ( Labat - de - Hoz and 485 Alonso , 2021 ) . From our current study , Pac1 is related to the lissencephaly - related protein LIS1 , 486 while Kar9 is related to the APC protein involved in colorectal cancer ( Geiser et al . , 1997 ; 487 19 Korinek et al . , 2000 ) . Moreover , the dynactin p150 Glued subunit associates with the huntingtin - 488 associated protein HAP1 ( Li et al . , 1998 ) ; these may act in a complex involved in vesicular 489 transport , particularly in axons . While direct roles for these proteins in mammalian CIE remain 490 unclear , both in health and disease , it will be interesting to assess whether disease - linked 491 mutations or losses of function alter cargo internalization , and whether such an effect might 492 contribute to cellular dysfunction in disease . 493 Overall , our findings lead us to propose a model in which the interplay between myosin - and 494 actin - dependent transport of microtubules , their cortical capture , and activation of 495 dynein / dynactin promote CIE in yeast ( Fig . 8 ) . Myo2 - dependent delivery of microtubule plus 496 ends to the cell cortex requires on Kar9 and Bim1 . As the plus end is transported through the 497 cytoplasm , tracking proteins such as Bik1 and Pac1 promote loading and retention of 498 dynein / dynactin , albeit in an inhibited state , and redundant pathways involving these proteins 499 help to ensure the fidelity of microtubule delivery to the cell cortex ( Adames and Cooper , 2000 ; 500 Farkasovsky and Küntzel , 2001 ; Lee et al . , 2000 ; Miller and Rose , 1998 ; Miller et al . , 2000 ; Yin 501 et al . , 2000 ) . Once delivered to the cell periphery , a hand - off event occurs wherein dynein 502 associates with the cMT - capturing protein Num1 , leading to cMT offloading from Myo2 , dynein 503 activation and minus end - directed motility ( Lee et al . , 2003 ; Lee et al . , 2005 ) . These events are 504 thought to be necessary for the force generation required to position the nucleus at the bud neck 505 during mitosis , thereby ensuring chromosome segregation and nuclear partitioning between 506 mother and daughter cells . However , since dynein is tethered to Num1 at the cell cortex during 507 this process , it seems plausible that minus end - directed motor activity could also exert inward 508 force at the plasma membrane . Combined with Bni1 - generated actin filaments and Myo2 motor 509 activity , this could facilitate membrane bending in the absence of clathrin , which is needed to 510 overcome the high turgor pressure in yeast cells ( Aghamohammadzadeh and Ayscough , 2009 ) . 511 Our observation that cytoplasmic microtubules contribute to the Rho1 pathway supports a role in 512 CIE , even though cytoplasmic microtubules appear to be sparse under most conditions in yeast . 513 It is thus plausible that microtubule cytoskeleton - stabilizing environmental conditions could 514 provide clues about how yeast CIE is regulated . Our future studies will examine this possibility , 515 and will further test roles for the interaction network between actin , microtubules , and their 516 respective motor proteins in membrane and protein internalization . 517 20 Materials and Methods 518 Yeast strains , plasmids , and growth conditions 519 Strains and plasmids used in this study are described in supplementary tables S1 and S2 , 520 respectively . Yeast were grown in liquid or plate - based YPD medium or on YNB ( SD ) medium 521 lacking uracil , tryptophan , histidine and / or lysine for maintenance of non - essential plasmids . All 522 cells were grown at 30°C and imaged at room temperature . PCR - based tagging of genomic loci 523 and gene knockouts were performed as described previously ( Goldstein and McCusker , 1999 ; 524 Longtine et al . , 1998 ) . Transformations for plasmid uptake or for genomic integrations were 525 performed using the LiAc method ( Schiestl and Gietz , 1989 ) . Unless otherwise specified , 526 chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich or from Fisher Scientific . 527 528 Construction and confirmation of MYO2 IQ repeat truncations 529 Plasmids for truncating Myo2 IQ repeats at the genomic MYO2 locus with HIS3 selection 530 were generously provided by Dr . Anthony Bretscher ( Cornell ; ( Schott et al . , 1999 ; Schott et al . , 531 2002 ) ) . The full - length control MYO2 6IQ plasmid was linearized with SpeI , while the truncated 532 myo2 4IQ and myo2 2IQ plasmids were linearized with BamHI , transformed into SEY6210 MAT a 533 wild - type or ent1 : : LEU2 yap1802 : : LEU2 cells , and selected on YNB medium lacking histidine . 534 ent1 : : LEU2 yap1802 : : LEU2 cells with Myo2 modifications were then mated with MATa 535 ent2 : : HIS3 yap1801 : : HIS3 cells . Resulting diploids were transformed with pENT2 . 416 [ CEN 536 URA3 ] , sporulated and tetrad dissected , and resulting ent1 : : LEU2 ent2 : : HIS3 yap1801 : : HIS3 537 yap1802 : : LEU2 + pENT2 . 416 ( 4∆ + Ent2 ) cells were confirmed by PCR . Cells were then 538 transformed with pENT1 . 414 or pENTH1 . 414 and grown on 5 - FOA plates to select for loss of 539 the pENT2 . 416 plasmid , yielding 4∆ + Ent1 and 4∆ + ENTH1 cells with wild - type or truncated 540 Myo2 . All Myo2 truncations were confirmed by PCR using the following primers : 5’ - 541 TTGATGGTGTTGTCTCAACTCAGAG - 3’ and 5’ - CATTGATTTGTGTAGCATTGACACC - 542 3’ , which amplify nucleotides 2047 - 3472 of the wild - type MYO2 coding sequence containing the 543 IQ repeat region . PCR products were then resolved by gel electrophoresis , and truncations were 544 confirmed by differences in size compared to full - length MYO2 . 545 546 547 548 21 Construction and confirmation of myo2 cargo - binding domain mutant strains 549 Plasmids for low - copy expression of MYO2 or myo2 CBD mutants with HIS3 selection were 550 generous gifts from Dr . Lois Weisman ( Univ . Michigan ; ( Catlett and Weisman , 1998 ; Eves et 551 al . , 2012 ; Ishikawa et al . , 2003 ; Pashkova et al . , 2006 ) ) . We used these as a starting point for 552 generating chromosomally - integrated CBD mutants at the endogenous MYO2 locus and 553 expressed as the sole source of Myo2 . To accomplish this , we isolated the 1 . 5 kb EcoRI fragment 554 from wild - type and CBD mutant Myo2 . 413 plasmids containing the C - terminal CBD and 3’ 555 untranslated region of MYO2 for subcloning into the EcoRI site of pRS404 . Resulting plasmids 556 were confirmed by sequencing , and the orientation of all inserts placed the 5’ end of the Myo2 557 CBD proximal to the KpnI end of the polylinker . The plasmids were then linearized with NruI , 558 transformed into SEY6210 MAT a wild - type or 4∆ + pENT2 . 416 cells , and selected on YNB 559 medium lacking tryptophan . 4∆ + Ent2 cells were then transformed with pENT1 . 317 or 560 pENTH1 . 317 and selected on YNB medium lacking lysine . Cells were subsequently grown on 5 - 561 FOA plates to select for loss of the pENT2 . 416 plasmid , yielding Myo2 WT or CBD mutant - 562 expressing 4∆ + Ent1 and 4∆ + ENTH1 strains . All WT and 4∆ strains with Myo2 CBD 563 modifications were confirmed by isolation of genomic DNA and PCR amplification of the 564 MYO2 CBD using forward primer 5’ - CTACCTCAAACACCATTAAAGGATG - 3’ and T3 as the 565 reverse primer . The resulting 1683 bp product spanning the 3’ end of MYO2 upstream of the 566 integration site through the 3’ untranslated region was then isolated using a PCR purification kit 567 ( Qiagen ) , and mutations were confirmed by sequencing using primer 5’ - 568 CTCATTTGTGGTGTTTGCTC - 3’ , which anneals to the MYO2 CDS beginning at nucleotide 569 3777 downstream of the + 1 site . 570 571 Latrunculin A and Nocodazole treatment 572 Liquid cultures of WT , 4∆ + Ent1 and 4∆ + ENTH1 cells expressing Ste3 - GFP and transformed 573 with empty vector ( pRS426 ) or high - copy ROM1 were grown to mid - logarithmic phase at 30°C 574 in YNB medium lacking uracil ( Christianson et al . , 1992 ; Ozaki et al . , 1996 ) . 0 . 7 OD 600 of each 575 strain was then pelleted by centrifugation at 3500 x g for 5 min , and cells were resuspended in 25 576 µl of YNB - ura medium supplemented with 200 µM Latrunculin A ( Enzo Life Sciences ) , 15 577 µg / ml Nocodazole , or an equivalent volume of DMSO as a vehicle control . Cells were then 578 incubated at 30°C for 2 h prior to imaging by fluorescence microscopy . 579 22 580 Visualization of actin morphology 581 To visualize actin patches and cables , yeast cells were stained using a protocol modified from 582 ( Amberg , 1998 ) . Briefly , myo3 ∆ myo5 ∆ cells were grown to mid - logarithmic phase in YNB 583 medium lacking uracil for plasmid selection . Cells were fixed at room temperature for 30 min by 584 addition of formaldehyde to a final concentration of 4 % ( v / v ) , then pelleted by centrifugation at 585 3000 x g for 5 min . Pellets were washed twice with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and stained 586 for 1 h with Alexa 568 phalloidin ( Thermo Fisher ) dissolved in methanol , and diluted to a final 587 concentration of 1 . 65 µM in PBS . Cells were then washed three times with PBS prior to imaging 588 by fluorescence microscopy . 589 590 Fluorescence microscopy and image analysis 591 Images were collected using either an Axiovert 200 inverted fluorescence microscope ( Zeiss ) 592 equipped with a 100X , 1 . 4 NA Plan - Apochromat oil immersion objective , Sensicam ( Cooke ) , X - 593 Cite 120 PC light source , and SlideBook 4 . 2 software ( 3i ) or using a DMi8 inverted fluorescence 594 microscope ( Leica ) equipped with a 100X , 1 . 47 NA Plan - Apochromat oil immersion objective , 595 LED3 fluorescence illumination system , Flash 4 . 0 v3 sCMOS camera ( Hamamatsu ) and LAS X 596 v3 . 7 . 6 . 25997 ( Leica ) . Within each experiment , all strains were imaged with the same acquisition 597 parameters and on the same day . All imaging was performed using cells grown to mid - 598 logarithmic phase . 599 Following acquisition , images were processed using Fiji / ImageJ2 v2 . 9 . 0 / 1 . 53t . Within each 600 experiment , identical post - imaging processing was performed on all images to set identical 601 minimum and maximum intensity levels , allowing direct comparison of protein localization and 602 fluorescence intensity . 603 For visualization of phalloidin - labeled cells , z - stacks were collected at 0 . 25 µm step intervals 604 spanning the entire depth of cells . Stacks were then collapsed into a maximum intensity z - 605 projection image using Fiji / ImageJ2 . 606 607 Quantification of Ste3 - pHluorin intensity 608 Quantification of Ste3 - pHluorin intensity was performed as described previously ( Prosser et 609 al . , 2010 ; Prosser et al . , 2016 ) . Briefly , random fields of cells for each condition analyzed were 610 23 visualized by DIC prior to imaging by fluorescence microscopy . All conditions within an 611 experiment were imaged on the same day , using identical acquisition parameters . Background 612 subtraction was then performed on 16 - bit images , individual cells were selected for measurement 613 of whole - cell fluorescence intensity , and values were corrected for cell size . Pre - determined 614 criteria for exclusion of cells from analysis are described in ( Prosser et al . , 2016 ) . 615 616 Statistical analysis 617 Power analysis was performed to determine population sizes using G * Power v3 . 1 . 9 . 6 , with 618 type I error a = 0 . 05 , type II error b = 0 . 2 ( power , 1 - b = 0 . 8 ) , and a moderate effect size f = 0 . 3 . For 619 experiments with four groups ( WT , 4∆ + Ent1 and 4∆ + ENTH1 backgrounds with empty vector ; 620 4∆ + ENTH1 with high - copy ROM1 ) using one - way ANOVA , the analysis recommended a 621 minimum of 32 cells measured per condition . 622 Statistical significance for all quantitative experiments was assessed using one - way ANOVA 623 followed by Tukey’s Multiple Comparison test in Prism 7 ( GraphPad ) . 624 625 Acknowledgements 626 We would like to gratefully acknowledge gifts of MYO2 plasmids from Drs .

Figure 8 : Model of protein modules involved in yeast clathrin - independent endocytosis . We previously identified several signaling modules and / or protein transport complexes that play roles in clathrin - independent endocytosis , including a cell wall stress - sensing module ( Mid2 , Rom1 , Rho1 ) , the polarisome ( including Bni1 , Bud6 and Spa2 ) , unbranched actin filaments stabilized by tropomyosins ( Tpm1 and Tpm2 ; Prosser et al . , 2011 ) , and a - arrestins ( Prosser et al . , 2015 ) . Here , we add Myo2 , proteins involved in microtubule plus - end transport ( Kar9 and possibly Bim1 ) , cytoplasmic microtubules and kinesin - related proteins involved in their stability ( Kip2 and Kip3 ) , dynein ( including Dyn1 and Pac11 ) , dynactin ( including Nip100 ) , microtubule plus - end tracking proteins ( Pac1 ) , and proteins involved in cortical microtubule capture ( Num1 ) as additional factors that contribute to CIE . To date , none of these additional proteins have defined roles in clathrin - mediated endocytosis .
