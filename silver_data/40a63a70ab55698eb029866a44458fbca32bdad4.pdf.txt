Characterization of and STORM imaging of 26 fluorescent dyes . ( a ) Chemical structure ( when available ) . Structures and classes of fluorophores were obtained from the manufacturers , with the exception of Alexa 647 1 , Atto 647N 2 , Atto 655 3 , DyLight 750 4 , Alexa 750 1 , and Alexa 790 5 . ( b ) Excitation and emission spectra . ( c , d ) Example single molecule fluorescence time traces in the presence of either ( c ) MEA or ( d ) β ME with GLOX . ( e , g ) Duty cycle ( red curves ) and survival fraction ( blue squares ) measurements . ( f , h ) Distributions of photons per switching event and corresponding exponential fits ( red curves ) . To demonstrate the impact of the above properties on STORM image reconstruction , 2D STORM images of ( i - l ) microtubules and ( m - n ) clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) are shown . ( i - l ) Microtubule images in the presence of GLOX and either ( i - j ) MEA or ( k - l ) β ME with the regions in the red boxes in ( i ) and ( k ) magnified in ( j ) and ( l ) , respectively . ( m - n ) CCP images in the presence of GLOX and β ME , with the two arrows identifying the vesicles in ( m ) shown in ( n ) , as indicated . Quality of microtubule images can be assessed based on the continuity of the localizations for a given filament along with distinction of neighboring filaments within a diffraction - limited area . For CCPs , the high - resolution 2D projection image from a dye with high photon number , low duty cycle , and high photostability should have a partially hollow spherical appearance with fewer localizations at the center of the sphere than at the edges . Dyes with low photon number and hence low localization precision tend to smear out the hollow structure of the CCP and give a relatively solid appearance . Dyes with high duty cycle , low photostability , and / or few switching cycles tend to generate images with too few localizations to define the high resolution structures . Scale bars : 1 μ m for ( i , k ) , 500 nm for ( j , l , m ) , and 50 nm for ( n ) . Most fluorophores studied exhibited excellent contrast between the on and off states with undetectable fluorescent signal in the off state , except for TAMRA and Atto 488 . TAMRA showed a faint “ghost” image of the labeled structure even after the dyes were switched off , and Atto 488 showed a faint image of the labeled structure when imaged in the yellow channel while performing multi - color imaging . 31 Supplementary Figure 28 . Simulations on the effect of number of switching cycles on STORM image reconstruction . ( a ) Simulated images of a 2x9 array of evenly spaced molecules each separated by 50 nm . The simulations assume 1 , 4 , 16 , or 64 localizations per molecule . The red “ + ” symbols indicate the simulated localization positions based on a Gaussian distribution with a FWHM of 20 nm ( green circle ) . As the number of localizations increases , the center positions of the localization clusters converge with the actual center position of the molecules ( centers of the green circles ) . Thus , multiple cycles of switching reduced the stochastic localization error . ( b ) Simulated STORM images for a 2x60 array of evenly spaced molecules with 1 , 4 , 16 , and 64 localizations per molecule . The actual molecule center positions are indicated with a red “x” . The two rows of molecules are separated by 35 nm and the intermolecular distance within each row is 8 . 2 nm . To mimic the appearance of STORM images used in this work , each localization is represented as a Gaussian peak and the position is determined based on a Gaussian distribution with a FWHM of 20 nm centered at the actual molecule position . With only one localization per molecule ( top image ) , the image appears patchy , and the two rows of molecules are not well - defined . As the number of localizations increases , the patchiness of the images decreases and two smooth rows of molecules emerge . Notably , this increase in image quality with increasing number of switching cycles per molecule 32 is clearly observed even when the separations between neighboring molecules are sufficiently small to prevent grouping of multiple localizations of the same molecule . Scale bar : 50 nm . 33 34 Supplementary Figure 29 . Effect of buffer conditions on the switching properties of Alexa 647 , Atto 488 , and Atto 655 dyes and the corresponding STORM image quality . All 3 dyes performed best in buffers containing both GLOX and thiol ( h , p , x ) . In this case , the thiol MEA was used . Reasonably good photoswitching performance was also observed for Atto 488 and Atto 655 in buffer containing GLOX only ( o , w ) , while the switching in all other conditions was relatively poor ( e , f , g , m , n , u , v ) . Quantitative analysis from single molecule measurements of photon numbers per switching cycle , duty cycle , survival fraction , and number of switching cycles ( ( a - d ) for Alexa 647 , ( i - l ) for Atto 488 , and ( q - t ) for Atto 655 ) corroborates these findings . Control experiments using Ellman’s reagent 6 were unable to detect free thiol in the “GLOX only” solution , indicating that free thiol was present at no more than ~ 1 μ M ( the detection limit of our measurement ) , which is more than 3 - 4 orders of magnitude lower in concentration than the thiol concentrations previously used for photoswitching of dyes 7 - 11 . Scale bars : 1 μ m . 35 Supplementary Figure 30 . Effect of buffer conditions on STORM image quality for Alexa 488 , Atto 520 , Cy3B , and Atto 680 . STORM images of microtubules taken under the “No GLOX or thiol” ( a , e , i , m ) , “Thiol only” ( b , f , j , n ) , “GLOX only” ( c , g , k , o ) , and “GLOX and thiol” ( d , h , l , p ) conditions . Scale bars : 1 μ m . 36 37 Supplementary Figure 31 . Dependence of the switching properties of Atto 488 , Cy3B , Alexa 647 , Atto 655 , and DyLight 750 on thiol concentration and the corresponding STORM image quality . ( a - d , f - i , k - n , p - s , u - x ) Single - molecule measurements of photon number per switching cycle , duty cycle , survival fraction , and number of switching cycles of dyes under different MEA concentrations ( ( a - d ) for Atto 488 , ( f - i ) for Cy3B , ( k - n ) for Alexa 647 , ( p - s ) for Atto 655 , and ( u - x ) for DyLight 750 ) . ( e , j , o , t , y ) STORM images of microtubules labeled with 38 Atto 488 ( e ) , Cy3B ( j ) , Alexa 647 ( o ) , Atto 655 ( t ) , and DyLight 750 ( y ) under different MEA concentrations . In all cases , we observed a reduction in the photon number at high ( 50 - 100 mM ) thiol concentrations and in some cases a reduction in the number of switching cycles as well . The optimal performance was achieved at low to moderate ( 2 - 10 mM ) thiol concentrations . Scale bars : 500 nm for ( e , j , o , y ) and 1 μ m for ( t ) . In all measurements , GLOX was used , and only the concentration of MEA was varied . 39 40 Supplementary Figure 32 . Dependence of the switching properties of Alexa 647 , Atto 655 , and Cy3B on laser intensity . ( a - d , h - k , o - r ) Single - molecule measurements of photon number per switching cycle , duty cycle , survival fraction , and number of switching cycles of dyes under different laser intensities for ( a - d ) Alexa 647 , ( h - k ) Atto 655 , and ( o - r ) Cy3B . STORM images of microtubules at the corresponding laser intensities are shown for ( e - g ) Alexa 647 , ( l - n ) Atto 655 , and ( s - u ) Cy3B as well . For Alexa 647 and Atto 655 , the photon values were relatively independent of laser intensity , whereas Cy3B showed a trend toward higher photon yield at higher laser intensities . In all cases , at lower excitation intensity , the dyes required longer times to reach their equilibrium duty cycle values due to reduced off - switching rates . At higher laser intensities , however , Atto 655 , and to a lesser extent Alexa 647 , underwent fewer switching cycles due to faster photobleaching rates . For these measurements , Alexa 647 and Cy3B were imaged in GLOX and 140 mM β ME , and Atto 655 was imaged in GLOX and 10 mM MEA . Scale bars : 500nm . 41 Supplementary Figure 33 . Four - color STORM imaging of in vitro assembled microtubule filaments directly labeled by Atto 488 ( green ) , Cy3B ( magenta ) , Dyomics 654 ( cyan ) , and DyLight 750 ( white ) . ( a ) Four - channel overlaid image . ( b ) Excitation and emission spectra of the four dyes ( dashed and solid curves , respectively ) , along with laser excitation wavelengths ( black vertical lines ) and corresponding emission filter bands ( grey regions ) used for our measurements . ( c - f ) Individual STORM images corresponding to Atto 488 , Cy3B , Dyomics 654 , and DyLight 750 channels , respectively , for the region in the yellow box in ( a ) . ( g ) The use of four fluorophores with non - overlapping emission spectra allowed for low - crosstalk multicolor imaging , where the crosstalk was measured to be 0 - 3 % between all pairs of channels except for Cy3B , which showed 8 % crosstalk into the adjacent Atto 488 and Alexa 647 channels . The asterisks indicate that the crosstalk was undetectable in those channels . Scale bars : 2 μ m for ( a ) and 500 nm for ( c - f ) . 42 Supplementary Figure 34 . Localization precision of Atto 488 , Cy3B , Alexa 647 , Dyomics 654 , and DyLight 750 dyes used in multicolor imaging . Isolated clusters of repetitive localizations coming from single fluorophores were used for each dye ( Atto 488 , Cy3B , Alexa 647 , Dyomics 654 , and DyLight 750 ) to estimate the localization precision . The two - dimensional histograms from this analysis were fit with a Gaussian function to determine the standard reported FWHM value . 43 Supplementary Figure 35 . Four - color cellular imaging using Atto 488 , Cy3B , Dyomics 654 , and DyLight 750 . ( a - d ) Individual channels of a four - color STORM image of Atto 488 - labeled microtubules ( green ) , Cy3B - labeled mitochondria ( magenta ) , Dyomics 654 - labeled endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ; cyan ) , and DyLight 750 - labeled acetylated tubulin ( white ) within a single fixed cell . ( e ) Zoom - in of the Cy3B and Dyomics 654 channels of the region in the yellow box in ( a - d ) , showing interactions between mitochondria and the ER . ( f ) Zoom - in of the Atto 488 and DyLight 750 channels of the same region show a subset of microtubules is heavily acetylated .
