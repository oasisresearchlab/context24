The key 3 transcriptional activators of the heat shock response in eukaryotes , the heat shock 4 factors ( HSFs ) , have undergone a large - scale gene amplification in plants . While 5 HSFs are central in heat stress responses , their role in ambient temperature 6 changes is less well understood . We show here that the warm ambient 7 temperature transcriptome is dependent upon the HSFA1 clade of Arabidopsis 8 HSFs , which cause a rapid and dynamic eviction of H2A . Z - nucleosomes at target 9 genes . A transcriptional cascade results in the activation of multiple downstream 10 stress responsive transcription factors , triggering large - scale changes to the 11 transcriptome in response to elevated temperature . H2A . Z - nucleosomes are 12 enriched at temperature responsive genes at non - inducible temperature , and thus 13 likely confer inducibility of gene expression and higher responsive dynamics . We 14 propose that the antagonistic effects of H2A . Z and HSF1 provide a mechanism to 15 activate gene expression rapidly and precisely in response to temperature , while 16 preventing leaky transcription in the absence of an activation signal . 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 3 Introduction 1 Warm temperature is an important cue for plants , which must be able to adapt to 2 their environment ( Wigge , 2013 ) . In Arabidopsis , many of the growth and 3 developmental responses to temperature are mediated by the bHLH transcription 4 factor PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4 ( Koini et al . , 2009 ; Kumar et 5 al . , 2012 ) , which is controlled by the thermosensor phyB ( Jung et al . , 2016 ; Legris 6 et al . , 2016 ) . The phyB temperature perception mechanism relies on dark 7 reversion , and consequently expression of the warm temperature transcriptome 8 controlling development occurs at night ( Jung et al . , 2016 ) . Plants are most likely 9 to encounter higher temperatures in sunlight however , suggesting an additional 10 mechanism to sense temperature during the day . Consistent with this , genes 11 involved in response to heat stress are predominantly expressed in the light ( Jung 12 et al . , 2016 ) . 13 14 Thermal stress is a major threat to the cell , causing protein denaturation and 15 compromising membrane integrity . Rising global temperature is estimated to 16 reduce crop yields by 2 . 5 to 16 % for every additional 1ºC of warming during hot 17 summers ( Battisti and Naylor , 2009 ) . It is therefore important to understand the 18 pathways and mechanisms by which warm temperature influences the cell . Work 19 in yeast , Drosophila , plants and mammalian cells has led to a widely established 20 model that genes encoding heat shock proteins ( HSPs ) are transcriptionally 21 induced by heat shock factor ( HSF ) - class transcription factors ( TFs ) upon 22 activation by heat stress ( Jacob et al . , 2017 ; Shivaswamy and Iyer , 2008 ; Zobeck 23 et al . , 2010 ) . A genetic screen in plants revealed that in addition to HSFs ( Miozzo 24 et al . , 2015 ) , the chromatin state also influences the expression of warm 25 temperature induced genes ( Kumar and Wigge , 2010 ) . Mutants deficient in the 26 incorporation of H2A . Z - nucleosomes show a higher HSP70 expression and many 27 phenotypes associated with warm temperature growth . Moreover it was shown 28 that H2A . Z - nucleosome occupancy decreases in response to temperature at 29 HSP70 and a few other genes ( Kumar and Wigge , 2010 ) , and heat stress results 30 in a global increase in chromatin accessibility at responsive loci ( Sullivan et al . , 31 2014 ) . It is unclear however , whether these dynamics of H2A . Z - nucleosomes 32 reflect a passive process by which the stability of H2A . Z - nucleosomes responds 33 M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 4 directly to temperature , or result from increased transcriptional responsiveness of 1 the loci , or a combination of these mechanisms . 2 3 The transcriptional activation of heat stress genes in plants is potentially 4 complicated by the high degree of gene duplication . While yeast has a single HSF , 5 Arabidopsis for example has 21 HSF family members ( von Koskull - Dˆring et al . , 6 2007 ) . One clade in particular , the HSFA1 group , appears to be important for the 7 early responses to heat stress ( Yoshida et al . , 2011 ) . Activation of the HSF 8 pathway in Arabidopsis is complex , with multiple downstream TFs being involved 9 ( Schramm et al . , 2008 ) . While the role of HSFA1 TFs in the response to heat 10 stress is well established , it is still not clear if these factors are involved in the 11 transcriptional response to warm temperature in the ambient range . While H2A . Z - 12 nucleosomes have been implicated in regulating the warm temperature 13 transcriptome , how they interact with TFs and other cis - acting factors is not clear . 14 15 In this study , we use genome - wide datasets to investigate the dynamics of both 16 nucleosome and TF behavior to determine their contributions to the temperature 17 transcriptome . We find that the day - time warm ambient temperature transcriptome 18 is dependent on HSFA1 TFs and these are rapidly and robustly recruited to the 19 promoters of responsive genes , activating their transcription . Moreover , we show 20 that HSFA1a TFs are essential for H2A . Z eviction occurring in response to warm 21 temperature at these genes . Activation of downstream TFs by the HSFA1 - class 22 results in a transcriptional cascade that can account for a large proportion of the 23 day - time warm temperature transcriptome . Genes responding rapidly to warmer 24 temperature display distinctive promoter architecture of heat shock elements 25 ( HSEs ) and nucleosome positions . We propose that both HSFA1 class TFs and 26 H2A . Z - nucleosomes enables a dynamic transcriptional response system to be 27 activated upon passing a threshold temperature . 28 29 30 M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 5 Results 1 2 A warm temperature transcriptome defined by the HSFA1 TFs 3 To analyze the day - time temperature response , we measured the temperature 4 transcriptomes of plants shifted 1 hour after dawn from 17 to 27ºC for 0 . 25 , 1 and 5 4 h . ( Supplemental Figure 1A ) . A total of 1 , 035 transcripts show significant 6 changes in these conditions ( see Methods ) , and we refer to these as the 7 “temperature responsive” transcripts ( Supplemental Figure 1B ) . Hierarchical 8 clustering of these temperature responsive genes reveals six major patterns of 9 transcriptional response to warmer temperature ( Figure 1A , Supplementary Figure 10 2A , Supplemental Dataset 1 ) . 11 12 Cluster 1 ( 350 genes , grey sidebar in Figure 1A ) contains the genes that are 13 predominantly repressed over time , and is enriched in genes involved in metabolic 14 processes ( based on a Gene Ontology , GO , enrichment analysis ) ( Eden et al . , 15 2009 ) , which are likely to be transcribed at a lower rate under stresses ( more 16 details on GO term analyses are in Supplemental Table 1 ) . Cluster 2 ( 193 genes , 17 blue ) shows partial up - regulation after 1 and 4 h at 27ºC , but the patterns are 18 similar to the 17ºC control samples at these time - points , suggesting the 19 transcriptional dynamics may be endogenous to the experimental setup , and / or 20 related to the circadian rhythm . The transcriptional activation of cluster 2 genes 21 appears to be more rapid at 27ºC than 17ºC after 1 h ( Supplemental Figure 2B ) . 22 Cluster 3 ( 110 genes , cyan ) demonstrates partial transcriptional repression but is 23 not significantly enriched for any functional GO term . Cluster 4 ( 130 genes , green ) 24 demonstrates rapid and transient transcriptional activation at both 17°C and 27°C , 25 followed by repression after 4 h , and is enriched in genes that are involved in 26 stress and defence responses . Both transcriptional activation and repression 27 seems to be faster at 27°C for the genes in this cl uster ( Supplemental Figure 2B ) . 28 Cluster 5 ( 105 genes , pink ) is the smallest cluster with a slight increase in 29 transcriptional level at 27°C , but not enriched in a GO term . Cluster 6 ( 147 genes , 30 red ) genes are termed “rapidly temperature responsive” , as they show maximal 31 expression within 15 min of 27ºC treatment . The peak of expression at 15 min is 32 transient , as the expression of these genes returns to near basal levels after 4 h . 33 M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 6 These genes are highly enriched in biological process GO terms of heat and light 1 responses ( Supplemental Table 1 ) , and include genes involved in the response to 2 heat stress such as HSP70 and other HSPs , HSFA7A and DREB2A 3 ( Supplemental Dataset 1 ) . The role of higher temperature in activating these 4 genes is particularly clear when gene expression at 27ºC is normalized to that at 5 17°C ( Supplementary Figure 2B ) . To confirm these re sults are a consequence of 6 rapid transcriptional activation , we investigated RNA Pol II occupancy by ChIP - 7 seq . We observe a corresponding increase in the relative amount of Pol II in the 8 gene bodies of the cluster 6 genes in response to ambient temperature increase , 9 which is absent in the control set of all genes ( Figure 1B ) . 10 11 The Arabidopsis genome encodes 21 HSFs and members of the HSFA1 class are 12 of particular importance in the early responses to heat since the hsfa1abde 13 quadruple ( QK ) mutant is more sensitive to mild heat stress ( Liu et al . , 2011 ; 14 Yoshida et al . , 2011 ) . We therefore investigated whether the QK mutant alters the 15 warm temperature transcriptome . Consistent with a major role for this HSF clade , 16 there is a global reduction in temperature responsiveness across all clusters in our 17 experiment ( Figure 1C and E , Supplemental Figure 2C ) , particularly clearly evident 18 after 15 min of shifting to 27ºC . Clusters 2 , 4 and 6 are most strongly perturbed , 19 with many transcripts showing little or no temperature responsiveness . 20 Interestingly , more than half the genes in cluster 6 ( 83 / 147 ~ 56 % ) lose 21 temperature responsiveness ( same criteria used to extract temperature responsive 22 transcript , see Methods ) after 15 min temperature shift in the QK mutant , as 23 compared to its corresponding TK wild - type , which has the same background as 24 QK but with HSFA1ABDE activity ( Figure 1D ) . Lower proportions of genes in 25 clusters 2 ( 59 / 193 ~ 31 % ) and 4 ( 21 / 130 ~ 16 % ) become unresponsive to 26 temperature in QK . 27 28 M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 7 HSFA1a binds to rapidly responsive genes and initiates a 1 transcriptional cascade in response to warm temperature 2 To determine if the effect of HSFA1a , a representative of the HSFA1 family TFs , 3 on the warm ambient temperature transcriptome is direct , we performed ChIP - seq 4 of HSFA1a on seedlings shifted from 17 to 27ºC for 15 min , and in controls kept at 5 17 o C ( Supplemental Figure 1A ) . We identified 1 , 371 genes that are directly bound 6 by HSFA1a within 15 min of 27ºC ( Supplemental Dataset 2 ) . Specifically , ~ 46 % of 7 cluster 6 genes are directly bound by HSFA1a , and in clusters 1 - 5 , 17 % of genes 8 are bound by HSFA1a , marked in red on the second sidebar of Figure 1A ( Fisher’s 9 exact P - value of the overlaps < 2 . 2e - 16 for both groups ) ( Supplemental Figure 10 3A ) . By comparison , HSFA1a binds to only ~ 5 % of the genes in Arabidopsis . 11 Consistent with HSFA1a binding the promoters of temperature responsive genes , 12 we observe strong enrichment for predicted heat shock elements ( HSEs ) in 13 clusters 2 and 6 ( Supplemental Table 2 ) . For cluster 6 genes we found predicted 14 HSEs within 44 / 84 ( ~ 52 % ) and 17 / 39 ( ~ 45 % ) of HSFA1a ChIP - seq peaks at 27 15 and 17ºC , respectively . 16 17 While HSFA1a targets are significantly enriched in clusters 1 , 2 , 4 and 6 ( Table 1 ) , 18 HSFA1a signal increases specifically for cluster 6 genes after 15 min of shift from 19 17ºC to 27ºC , ( Figure 2A , Wilcoxon test P - value < 2 . 2e - 16 when comparing cluster 20 6 genes to genes in clusters 1 - 5 ) . For rapidly temperature responsive genes 21 ( cluster 6 ) , there is significant signal for HSFA1a at the non - inductive temperature 22 of 17ºC at HSEs and over the gene body , and this markedly increases at 27ºC 23 ( Figure 2B ) . Increase in HSFA1a occupancy upon temperature increase can be 24 observed in most of cluster 6 genes ( Figure 2C , red dots represent predicted 25 HSEs ) . This increase in HSFA1a occupancy with temperature is not seen in other 26 clusters , including cluster 2 , which is also enriched for predicted HSEs 27 ( Supplemental Figure 3B - E ) . 28 29 Consistent with the central role of HSFA1a in shaping the rapid transcriptional 30 responses to warm temperature , there is a positive correlation between changes in 31 transcription and HSFA1a binding occupancy in response to shifting at 27ºC only 32 for cluster 6 genes ( P - value from linear model fitting = 1 . 5e - 11 , Figure 2D ) , in line 33 M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 8 with a previous study showing the major role of HSFA1a in regulating the 1 response to heat stress ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) . Within cluster 6 , ~ 56 % ( 83 / 147 ) of the 2 genes become unresponsive to temperature in the QK mutant . Interestingly , we 3 observe direct binding of HSFA1a to ~ 58 % of these ( 48 / 83 , Fisher’s exact test P - 4 value < 2 . 2e - 16 ) . HSFA1a binding also occurs at ~ 32 % ( 35 / 111 , P - value = 2 . 6e - 15 ) 5 of the other temperature - responsive genes that lose responsiveness in the 6 hsfa1abde background in clusters 1 - 5 ( Figure 2E ) . Despite HSEs being found in 7 multiple clusters , the rapid increase in transcript abundance of the cluster 6 genes , 8 accompanied by increased HSFA1a occupancy , is specific for this group of genes . 9 Taken together , these results indicate that the presence of an HSE alone is 10 insufficient to predict rapid gene induction by temperature . We note that the 11 HSFA1a target genes identified here might be under - estimated , as the ChIP was 12 performed using a HSFA1a - tagged line in a wild - type background , and thus might 13 be subjected to interference by the native HSFA1a that could potentially decrease 14 ChIP signal . We nonetheless observe a strong overlap of ~ 43 % ( 83 / 194 ) between 15 identified HSFA1a targets in all temperature - responsive genes ( cluster 1 - 6 ) , and 16 the genes becoming unresponsive to temperature in the QK mutant . 17 18 While HSFA1a only binds directly to ~ 17 % of the temperature responsive genes 19 outside of cluster 6 , we observe that the expression of up to 32 % of these genes is 20 perturbed in hsfa1abde ( Figure 2E ) . This could be because some targets require 21 HSFA1 b , d or e and cannot be bound by HSFA1a . We think this is unlikely 22 however , since the HSFA1 clade has a highly conserved DNA binding domain and 23 the HSFA1A knockout mutants are highly redundant ( Liu et al . , 2011 ; Yoshida et 24 al . , 2011 ) . Furthermore , many of the temperature responsive genes outside of 25 cluster 6 do not have a clearly identifiable HSE in their promoters . As we show , 26 several of the direct targets of HSFA1a are themselves TFs , it is plausible that 27 these are part of a transcriptional cascade that activates a broader range of 28 transcriptional targets . We identified 9 TFs in cluster 6 that are directly bound by 29 HSFA1a , and have previously been implicated in transcriptional responses , 30 particularly to stresses . These HSFA1a targets are two members of the HFSB2 31 family ( HSFB2A and HFSB2B ) , two members of the HSFA7 family ( HSFA7A and 32 HSFA7B ) , two closely related myb homeodomain TFs ( EARLY PHYTOCHROME 33 RESPONSE1 ( EPR1 ) and At3g10113 ) , and genes encoding the stress responsive 34 M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 9 TFs bZIP28 , RAP2 . 4 and DREB2A . We were able to identify potential targets for 6 1 of these TFs in all temperature responsive clusters ( HSFB2A , HFSB2B , EPR1 , 2 At3g10113 , bZIP28 and DREB2A ) , using data generated by DNA affinity 3 purification coupled with sequencing ( DAP - seq ) ( O ' Malley et al . , 2016 ) . Our 4 analysis reveals a cascade by which these intermediate TFs are able to transmit 5 the warm temperature signal to genes in other clusters . This cascade can 6 therefore account for a large proportion of the temperature transcriptome , and 7 likely contributes to the temporal variation in the responses we see ( Figure 2F , 8 Supplemental Table 3 ) . 9 10 H2A . Z - nucleosomes signal transiently decreases at rapidly 11 responsive genes at 27ºC 12 As H2A . Z - nucleosomes at the + 1 nucleosome of HSP70 can be evicted in 13 response to warm temperature ( Kumar and Wigge , 2010 ) we used ChIP - seq of 14 FLAG tagged HTA11 , a broadly expressed H2A . Z gene , to determine if this is a 15 global response of temperature responsive genes . We observe that cluster 6 16 genes show a rapid loss of HTA11 ChIP signal at the transcriptional start site 17 ( TSS ) in response to 27ºC ( Figure 3A ) . We were able to confirm this dynamic 18 behavior for the occupancy of HTA9 , a separate H2A . Z protein , using anti - HTA9 19 antibodies ( Yelagandula et al . , 2014 ) , at HSP70 ( Figure 6B and Supplemental 20 Figure 8B ) , indicating that HTA11 ChIP signal is representative of H2A . Z - 21 nucleosome occupancy for temperature responsive genes . The decrease of 22 HTA11 ChIP signal on temperature responsive promoters is dynamic , since we 23 observe signal returning after 1 h , and by 4 h the HTA11 ChIP signal is 24 comparable to the starting levels at 17ºC . This depletion of H2A . Z - nucleosome 25 occupancy is not confined to the + 1 nucleosome , but also occurs in the gene body 26 and the region surrounding the transcriptional termination site ( TTS ) ( Figure 3B , 27 Supplemental Figure 4A ) . We also sought to determine whether temperature 28 responsiveness is a general property of H2A . Z - nucleosomes or whether this 29 occurs only at specific loci . Interestingly , we see that H2A . Z - nucleosome eviction 30 is only clearly apparent at cluster 6 , and not at the other clusters ( Figure 3C , 31 Wilcoxon test P - value < 2 . 2e - 16 when comparing cluster 6 genes to genes in 32 clusters 1 - 5 , and Supplemental Figure 4D ) . We also observed a strong negative 33 M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 10 correlation between transcription and HTA11 occupancy in response to shifting to 1 27ºC for 15 min ( Figure 3D and Supplemental Figure 4B ) . This negative 2 correlation is specific to cluster 6 , as it is not observed elsewhere , even in clusters 3 2 and 4 ( Supplemental Figure 5 ) where partial increases of transcription levels are 4 observed , together with occurrence of predicted HSEs and HSFA1a binding . 5 6 H2A . Z loss at temperature - responsive genes is associated with 7 increased chromatin accessibility 8 A key question is the extent to which H2A . Z - nucleosome eviction is required for 9 transcriptional activation or a consequence of it . The occupancy of HTA11 at 10 cluster 6 genes ( solid lines , Figure 3E and Supplemental Figure 4C ) is markedly 11 higher than that of the genome - wide average at 17ºC ( dotted lines ) , but within 15 12 min at 27ºC this drops below the average . Again , this high baseline HTA11 ChIP 13 signal at 17ºC for the + 1 nucleosome is not observed in clusters 2 and 4 14 ( Supplemental Figure 5C - F ) . This trend is also apparent within cluster 6 , as we 15 can identify two subgroups based on HTA11 dynamics : 6A , which shows robust 16 decreases in HTA11 ChIP signal , and 6B , where the change in HTA11 is less 17 clear ( Figure 3F ) . Interestingly , genes in 6A are also characterized by higher 18 baseline HTA11 ChIP signal at 17ºC compared to both the genome average and 19 subgroup 6B ( Figure 3G ) . While transcripts in both 6A and 6B are activated within 20 15 min at 27ºC , 6A genes show a greater dynamic range with little or no 21 expression at 17ºC compared to 6B genes that show moderate expression at this 22 temperature ( Figure 3H ) . These observations suggest that H2A . Z - nucleosomes 23 may act to enhance the transcriptional dynamic range by keeping genes 24 transcriptionally repressed under non - inductive conditions by restricting promoter 25 and gene accessibility . 26 27 We also assessed the influence of H2A . Z - nucleosomes on the temperature 28 transcriptome by comparing transcriptional responses of WT plants shifted to 27ºC 29 for 15 min , with arp6 - 1 , which is deficient in H2A . Z incorporation . Interestingly , 30 transcriptional changes due to temperature shift and in arp6 - 1 appear to be more 31 correlated in cluster 6 , as compared to genome - wide ( Pearson correlations , 0 . 24 32 for cluster 6 versus 0 . 12 genome - wide , Supplemental Figure 5G ) , and to any other 33 M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 11 cluster ( Pearson correlations of 0 . 004 , - 0 . 01 , - 0 . 04 , 0 . 05 and - 0 . 06 for clusters 1 to 1 5 , respectively ) . This further supports a model where H2A . Z - nucleosomes create a 2 local chromatin environment refractory to transcription at 17ºC for genes in cluster 3 6 , which is diminished when shifted to 27ºC or in arp6 - 1 . 4 5 To measure chromatin accessibility , we investigated the accessibility of chromatin 6 to micrococcal nuclease ( MNase ) genome - wide using sequencing ( MNase - seq ) on 7 seedlings subjected to the same temperature shift regime as described above . 8 Since nucleosomes protect DNA from MNase cleavage , this provides a robust 9 assay of nucleosome accessibility . Genes within cluster 6 are enriched for MNase - 10 protected sequences at 17ºC , but these become accessible after shifting to 27ºC 11 ( Supplemental Figure 6A ) . This higher protection of the + 1 nucleosome at 17ºC is 12 less distinct for genes in clusters 2 or 4 ( Supplemental Figure 6B ) . Loss of HTA11 13 ChIP signal correlates with loss of MNase - seq signals at the + 1 nucleosome 14 position for cluster 6 genes ( Supplemental Figure 6C , red dots ) , when shifted to 15 27ºC . This suggests that the genomic DNA at these genes becomes more 16 accessible when H2A . Z is evicted compared with the other temperature 17 responsive genes ( Supplemental Figure 6C , black dots ) . To investigate whether 18 the changes in DNA accessibility are specific to H2A . Z - containing nucleosomes , or 19 whether they reflect broader changes in nucleosome dynamics , we investigated 20 how other histones changed under the same temperature shift . H3 occupancy is 21 indistinguishable between cluster 6 genes and the rest of the genome at 17ºC and 22 27ºC ( Supplemental Figure 6D - E ) or genes in clusters 2 and 4 ( Supplemental 23 Figure 6F ) . This suggests that the decrease in H2A . Z signal in response to heat 24 does not reflect a general depletion of nucleosomes in response to greater 25 transcription of these loci , but rather the specific exchange of H2A . Z - nucleosomes 26 for H2A . 27 28 Promoter architecture of genes responding rapidly to 29 temperature may facilitate transcriptional activation 30 We have seen that HSFA1a binds to and activates transcription of a large 31 proportion of the cluster 6 genes , and consistent with this we observe 130 32 instances of predicted HSEs among these genes , statistically greater than 33 M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 12 expected by chance ( Figure 4A , Fisher’s exact test P - value < 2 . 2e - 16 ) . We do not 1 observe this degree of enrichment for the other clusters , highlighting the 2 importance of the HSF class of TF in mediating this response . Furthermore , in the 3 promoters of cluster 6 genes , HSEs appear to be strongly positioned within 200 bp 4 upstream of the TSS , adjacent to the + 1 nucleosome that exhibits loss of HTA11 5 signal after the temperature shift ( Figure 4B ) . This is also true for predicted HSEs 6 in cluster 6 genes with bound HSFA1a ( ChIP - filtered HSEs ) , based on our ChIP - 7 seq experiments . Examining the target genes of HSFA1a , we also observed 8 significant enrichment of HSE occurrences close to the TSS , as compared to other 9 genes ( Figure 4C ) . In contrast , the distribution of HSEs elsewhere in the genome , 10 or even in cluster 2 where HSEs are also statistically enriched , do not show such a 11 pattern in their distribution ( Figure 4D ) . Consistent with the importance of HSF TFs 12 in this response , we observe specific H2A . Z - nucleosome depletion upon shifting to 13 27ºC for cluster 6 genes with HSEs ( red box ) , when compared to other genes 14 ( black ) ( Wilcoxon test P - values < 2 . 2e - 16 ) ( Figure 4E ) . This reduction of HTA11 15 signal is still greater than when compared to other temperature responsive gene 16 clusters 1 - 5 ( grey ) , or even cluster 6 genes without HSEs ( pink ) . In addition , 59 of 17 65 of cluster 6 genes with HSEs show a reduced H2A . Z signal when shifted to 18 27ºC , and in 31 of these genes , the H2A . Z signal is reduced by more than half , 19 providing further evidence that the HSEs at close proximity of H2A . Z - nucleosomes 20 in cluster 6 genes are strongly associated with H2A . Z reduction ( Figure 4F ) . 21 22 The transcriptional response of the warm temperature genes is 23 triggered by absolute temperature 24 The transcriptional changes we observe could reflect a response to a relative 25 change in temperature or be triggered by crossing an absolute temperature 26 threshold . To distinguish between these possibilities , we generated 27 transcriptomes , in conjunction with HTA11 and HSFA1a ChIP - seq datasets , for 28 seedlings shifted from 17 to 22ºC , from 22 to 27ºC , as well as from 17 to 37ºC . 29 While shifting seedlings from 22 to 27ºC elicits a robust induction of the warm 30 temperature response ( Figure 5A ) , comparable to the previous shift from 17 to 31 27ºC , only a very mild change in gene expression is seen for the 17 to 22ºC shift 32 ( Supplemental Figure 7A ) . This indicates that absolute temperature plays a pivotal 33 M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 13 role in determining the transcriptional response , since both these shifts were of the 1 same magnitude ( 5ºC change ) , but had very different transcriptional outcomes . 2 These results are supported by the HTA11 occupancy behavior , where shifting to 3 27ºC had a strong effect , but 22ºC did not ( Supplemental Figure 7A - B ) . 4 Furthermore , increasing the temperature to 37ºC causes a strong induction of the 5 cluster 6 genes ( Figure 5B and Supplementary Figure 7C ) , concomitant with a 6 strong increase in HSFA1a signal at the responsive genes ( Figure 5C ) , and a 7 greater loss of HTA11 and MNase signals that are maintained over 4 h ( Figure 5D 8 and Supplemental Figure 7D - E ) . Interestingly , the transcriptional induction of 9 HSP70 in plants shifted from 17ºC to 27ºC was observed only during the day but 10 not in the dark , whereas HSP70 induction occurs in both light and dark when 11 shifted to 37 o C ( Supplemental Figure 7F ) . Taken together , these results indicate 12 that there is a key threshold temperature between 22ºC and 27ºC that must be 13 passed for the induction of cluster 6 genes during the day , and once this is 14 activated , further increasing temperature results in a quantitative increase in gene 15 activation . 16 17 HSFA1a binding at warm temperature is necessary to promote 18 H2A . Z loss and transcriptional activation 19 To understand the relationship between HTA11 , gene expression and HSFA1a 20 more clearly , we asked if HTA11 and / or HSFA1a occupancy are good predictors 21 of transcriptional level among the cluster 6 genes . We see a strong positive 22 correlation between transcription and HSFA1a occupancy ( P - value = 1 . 5e - 11 for 23 linear model fitting ) , and a negative relationship between transcription and HTA11 24 signal ( Supplemental Table 4 ) ( P - value = 1 . 1e - 9 ) , indicating that both HTA11 and 25 HSFA1a can predict the transcriptional response to 27ºC to a certain extent . 26 Interestingly , combining HSFA1a and HTA11 occupancies provides a prediction of 27 gene expression upon shifting from 17ºC to 27ºC with higher confidence , based on 28 a linear model fitted using transcriptional rate as a response ( P - value = 8 . 5e - 15 , 29 Figure 6A , Supplementary Table 4 ) . Within cluster 6 , the sub - class 6A genes ( red 30 dots ) demonstrate a greater reduction of H2A . Z signal , gain of HSFA1a , and 31 transcriptional induction , as compared to the sub - class 6B ( orange ) . Such a 32 correlation is not observed in randomly selected non - temperature - responsive 33 M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 14 genes ( P - value = 0 . 38 , Supplemental Figure 8A , Supplemental Table 4 ) . These 1 results show that both HSFA1 class TFs and H2A . Z - nucleosomes are necessary 2 for rapid transcriptional responses to warmer temperatures , but how they influence 3 each other is not clear . 4 5 To investigate whether H2A . Z - nucleosome eviction is mediated by temperature 6 directly or via other factors , we performed in vitro ChIP on purified nucleosomes 7 from Arabidopsis seedlings grown at 17ºC ( see Supplemental Figure 8C and 8 Methods ) . We observe that the H2A . Z - nucleosomes at + 1 position near HSP70 9 are now not responsive to temperature in vitro ( Supplemental Figure 8D ) . In 10 addition , we also looked into the temperature responsiveness of reconstituted 11 H2A . Z - nucleosomes in vitro using a fluorescence resonance energy 12 transfer ( FRET ) assay . This allows us to directly assay the behavior of 13 nucleosomes in response to temperature in the absence of other cellular 14 components such as remodelers or TFs . We observe no significant change in 15 DNA dynamics on the nucleosome at a wide range of ambient temperatures 16 ( Supplemental Figure 8E - F ) . 17 18 If H2A . Z - nucleosomes are not intrinsically temperature - responsive , could HSFA1a 19 be one of the factors that influence DNA binding of H2A . Z - nucleosomes in 20 response to temperature shift ? To assess the role of HSFA1a on H2A . Z eviction in 21 vivo , we performed ChIP - qPCR for HTA9 in the QK hsfa1abde mutant and TK WT , 22 in response to temperature shift , at the HSP70 gene , at CBF , which is a positive 23 control gene where H2A . Z signal remains after shift to 27ºC , and at AT3G12590 , 24 which is a negative control gene where no H2A . Z signal is observed . Interestingly , 25 + 1 H2A . Z - nucleosome at HSP70 , as measured by ChIP , is no longer 26 thermoresponsive in hsfa1abde ( Figure 6B and Supplementary Figure 8B ) . This 27 indicates that temperature dependent H2A . Z - nucleosome depletion at induced 28 genes requires HSFA1a . 29 30 31 M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 15 Discussion 1 A dynamic transcriptional cascade protects the cell from warm temperatures 2 We have constructed a comprehensive data set of temperature transcriptomes of 3 WT and QK hsfa1abde mutant plants subjected to ambient temperature shift at 4 three time points : 0 . 25 , 1 and 4 h , with corresponding genome - wide binding 5 profiles of the TF HSFA1a , Pol II , and histones H2A . Z and H3 , in parallel with 6 MNase nucleosome stability assays in consistent conditions ( Supplemental Figure 7 1 ) . We first observe a rapid induction of a core set of transcripts highly enriched for 8 genes encoding cellular protective proteins such as chaperones within 15 min shift 9 from 17 to 27°C . The activation of these genes is t ransient as they show a 10 reduction of transcriptional levels after 1 h , and return to the baseline by 4 h . The 11 warm temperature cellular protection pathway is therefore under tight 12 transcriptional control and is rapidly attenuated when seedlings are maintained at 13 warm temperatures , consistent with previous observations for heat stress ( Ohama 14 et al . , 2016 ) . Since chaperones function as ATPases , it may be important to 15 control their expression levels for energy homeostasis within the cell . In 16 Drosophila , maintaining flies at higher ambient temperature causes a depletion of 17 body fat stores and a decline in fitness ( Klepsatel et al . , 2016 ) . HSFA1a directly 18 activates multiple activating TFs in cluster 6 genes , as well as the transcriptional 19 repressors HSFB2A and HSFB2 . These TFs may act in a negative feedback loop 20 to fine tune the response to warm temperature , and genes up - regulated in hsfb1 - 21 1 / hsfb2b ( Ikeda et al . , 2011 ) are highly enriched in cluster 6 ( Fisher ' s exact test p - 22 value < 2 . 2e - 16 , Supplemental Table 3 ) . This indicates that HSFA1a and 23 HSFB2A / B may act in an incoherent feed - forward loop , a common regulatory motif 24 in biology ( Milo et al . , 2002 ) . 25 26 In addition to HSFB2A and HSFB2B , we show that HSFA1a also directly regulates 27 multiple key TFs involved in stress response signaling , in response to warm 28 temperature : HSFA7A , DREB2A , RAP2 . 4 , EPR1 and BZIP28 ( Gao et al . , 2008 ; 29 Larkindale and Vierling , 2008 ; Lin et al . , 2008 ; Ohama et al . , 2017 ; Sakuma et al . , 30 2006 ; Yoshida et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 2F ) . This is well in line with earlier studies 31 showing that the HSFA1 family are key regulators of genes involving in responses 32 to heat as well as other abiotic stresses such as oxidative , osmotic and salt 33 M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 16 stresses ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) . Strikingly , these TFs that are HSFA1 targets bind to the 1 promoters of multiple genes that are differentially expressed upon the shift to 2 27ºC . It therefore appears that there is a transcriptional cascade from HSFA1a via 3 these additional TFs , and this can partly account for differentially transcribed 4 genes after shifting to 27ºC , as previously described for heat stress ( Ohama et al . , 5 2016 ) . Consistent with this model , hsfa1abde shows a greatly attenuated 6 transcriptional response to 27ºC , even for genes that are responsive to 7 temperature but not bound by HSFA1a directly . This transcriptional cascade can 8 help account for the diverse transcriptional responses to day - time warm 9 temperature of genes in cluster 1 - 5 ( Figure 1A ) with both activation as well as 10 repression of genes , occurring over different timescales . To this end , the direct 11 control of a key set of TFs , including HSFB2A , HSFB2A , EPR1 , At3g10113 and 12 bZIP28 enables a complex transcriptional outcome in response to a single rapid 13 stimulus . This role of HSFA1 TFs as master regulators of key TFs coordinating 14 responses to heat stress and drought resembles the sequential waves of 15 transcriptional activation observed in responding to the environment ( Murray et al . , 16 2004 ) and during cell differentiation ( Boyd et al . , 2014 ) . 17 18 The heat protection response has an activation threshold and increases 19 quantitatively above that 20 Temperature has diverse influences upon plant growth , development and survival . 21 An open question is the extent to which these response pathways share common 22 or separate initial temperature sensing events and downstream transcriptional 23 cascades . In this study we have focused on the response to 27ºC during the day , 24 typically not regarded as a heat stress ( Balasubramanian et al . , 2006 ) . 25 Interestingly however , much of the transcriptomic response appears to be 26 conserved with higher temperature heat stress responses , suggesting that even 27 27ºC is sufficient to activate these pathways . The key regulators we observe 28 ( HSFA1 , DREB2A , HSFA7 , RAP2 . 4 , BZIP28 , MBF1C and HSFB2 ) have also 29 previously been shown to be central in high temperature stress responses ( Gao et 30 al . , 2008 ; Ikeda et al . , 2011 ; Larkindale and Vierling , 2008 ; Lin et al . , 2008 ; Liu et 31 al . , 2013 ; Schramm et al . , 2008 ) . The HSFA1 class TFs appear to activate both 32 heat stress and warm ambient temperature pathways during the day , in agreement 33 with the previous observation that hsfa1abde is hypersensitive to prolonged 34 M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 17 exposure to 27°C ( Liu and Charng , 2013 ) . In contras t to the heat stress pathway , 1 growth and developmental responses to warm temperature , mediated via the 2 evening complex ( Box et al . , 2015 ; Mizuno et al . , 2014 ; Raschke et al . , 2015 ) or 3 thermosensory phytochromes ( Jung et al . , 2016 ; Legris et al . , 2016 ) , occur 4 predominantly at night and control different target genes ( Ezer et al . , 2017 ; Jung et 5 al . , 2016 ) . 6 7 Our results indicate that an absolute temperature , rather than relative temperature 8 is important for cluster 6 genes activation and suggest the presence of a threshold 9 between 22 and 27ºC for transcriptional induction of HSFA1a targets . Further 10 experiments would be required to define the exact threshold temperature for 11 cluster 6 genes activation , and this may vary from gene to gene depending on the 12 promoter architecture . Above this activation threshold temperature , there is a 13 quantitative increase in transcriptional induction with temperature , as seen in 14 further activation of temperature responsive genes in plants shifted to 37ºC . Since 15 HSFA1a is expressed constitutively in the plant , the temperature perception event 16 in this pathway may occur at the level of the HSFA1 protein , consistent with the 17 extensive post - translational modifications of HSFs in response to heat stress in 18 plants ( Ohama et al . , 2016 ) . HSFA1a binding signal is detectable by ChIP at a 19 number of temperature rapid - response genes at 17°C ( Figure 2B and 20 Supplemental Figure 3D ) , suggesting that the TF may maintain genes in a poised 21 state , ready for activation in response to warm temperature via the recruitment of 22 additional HSFs and / or other components of transcriptional machinery complexes , 23 a scenario which has been previously observed in yeast ( Shivaswamy and Iyer , 24 2008 ; Zanton and Pugh , 2006 ) . 25 26 A combinatorial role for H2A . Z and HSF1 to mediate temperature responsive 27 gene expression 28 The day - time warm temperature transcriptome is important for cellular survival and 29 is able to be rapidly activated and shutdown . While HSFA1 TFs are essential for 30 this response , many genes with HSEs in their promoters are not rapidly activated 31 by temperature , indicating additional factors might be required to confer rapid and 32 robust temperature responsive gene expression . Nucleosome architecture at 33 promoters can contribute to the transcriptional responsiveness of gene expression 34 M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 18 ( Lam et al . , 2008 ; Weber et al . , 2014 ) , and in this study we observe a strong 1 tendency for temperature responsive promoters to have well - positioned H2A . Z - 2 nucleosomes just downstream of HSEs ( Figure 4B ) . Furthermore , we observe a 3 specific temperature dependent depletion of H2A . Z - nucleosome signal at these 4 loci at higher temperature . This drop is also associated with an increase in 5 nucleosome accessibility as shown by a reduction of signal in the MNase - seq . 6 However , this may not simply reflect a removal of nucleosomes by the 7 transcriptional machinery upon the activation of transcription , because a 8 concomitant drop in H3 is not observed . This is in agreement with a previous 9 observation of an increase in nucleosome accessibility without reduction in 10 nucleosome occupancy during rapid transcriptional activation ( Mueller et al . , 11 2017 ) . This specific depletion of H2A . Z - nucleosomes in response to temperature 12 requires HSFA1a activity , and it does not occur on chromatin in vitro or on 13 reconstituted nucleosomes . Further experiments on H2A . Z occupancy changes in 14 response to temperature using drugs blocking transcription , may reveal if H2A . Z 15 eviction is indeed mediated by HSFA1a , or is a consequence of transcriptional 16 activation . Here , we also observe strong H2A . Z eviction at genes transcriptionally 17 activated in response to warm temperature , whereas a previous study suggested 18 that H2A . Z eviction might be independent of expression changes ( Kumar and 19 Wigge , 2010 ) . This discrepancy could potentially have arisen from differences in 20 temperature shift regimes ( shifting from 12°C to 27 °C for 2 or 24 h , as opposed to 21 17°C to 27°C for 15 min in day - time ) , and a more re stricted set of genes being 22 analyzed by ChIP - qPCR ( 6 genes that showed a decreased or flat transcriptional 23 response to temperature showed some level of H2A . Z decline by ChIP - qPCR ) . 24 25 Being refractory to transcription in vitro ( Park et al . , 2004 ; Thakar et al . , 2010 ) , 26 H2A . Z - nucleosomes are well suited for creating inducible transcriptional switches 27 ( Figure 6C ) . At non - permissive conditions , loci can be maintained in a fully 28 repressed state , but upon H2A . Z - nucleosome depletion , loci are fully accessible 29 for rapid expression . In this way , the specific replacement of the H2A . Z - H2B dimer 30 from nucleosomes may provide a particularly rapid and reversible transcriptional 31 activation switch , and may also account for the paradoxical observation that 32 H2A . Z - nucleosomes anti - correlate with H3 - H4 turnover ( Weber et al . , 2014 ) . This 33 depletion of H2A . Z at transcriptionally activated genes in response to elevated 34 M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 19 temperature is in agreement with a recent study demonstrating depletion of H2A . Z 1 at genes transcriptionally activated in response to drought stress and an 2 overrepresentation of genes affected by drought stress among the genes mis - 3 regulated in a H2A . Z - depleted mutant ( Sura et al . , 2017 ) . This together with our 4 results suggest a repressive role of H2A . Z at genes responding to different 5 environmental stresses , possibly by creating a closed chromatin environment 6 refractory to transcription . 7 8 The mechanism by which H2A . Z - nucleosomes are depleted in response to high 9 temperature may involve additional chromatin - remodelling complexes . For 10 example , in Drosophila , HSF1 cooperates with the FACT complex to maintain the 11 chromatin in an open state for transcription ( Saunders et al . , 2003 ) . We observe 12 an increase of HSFA1a signal at the HSEs at warm temperature , just upstream of 13 the + 1 nucleosome ( Figures 2C and 4B ) , and the signal appears to extend into the 14 gene body . The presence of HSFA1a around the + 1 H2A . Z - containing 15 nucleosome suggests that HSFA1a may recruit RNA Pol II machinery and / or 16 chromatin remodelers to facilitate transcription and H2A . Z eviction , though this 17 cannot yet be confirmed in this study . Indeed , the recruitment of chromatin 18 remodelers and modifiers to the gene promoters by specific TFs appears to be a 19 common theme enabling the intricate regulation of transcriptional rate 20 ( Charoensawan et al . , 2012 ; Lam et al . , 2008 ; Stockinger et al . , 2001 ; Teichmann 21 et al . , 2012 ; Vercruyssen et al . , 2014 ; Wu et al . , 2012 ; Zhang et al . , 2014 ; Zhao et 22 al . , 2015 ) . We observe a rapid eviction and re - insertion of H2A . Z upon 23 temperature increase and it would be of interest to further investigate if the 24 chromatin regulators that have been shown previously to deposit H2A . Z into 25 chromatin are involved in this process . H2A . Z is incorporated into chromatin by the 26 SWR1 chromatin remodeling complex , composed of PIE1 , ARP6 and SWC6 in 27 Arabidopsis ( Choi et al . , 2007 ; Deal et al . , 2005 ; Lazaro et al . , 2008 ; March - Diaz 28 and Reyes , 2009 ; Noh and Amasino , 2003 ; Zilberman et al . , 2008 ) . The INO80 29 complex has also been shown to be involved in H2A . Z deposition in yeast 30 ( Papamichos - Chronakis et al . , 2011 ) . On the contrary , aside from the human 31 chaperone protein ANP32E that was shown to remove H2A . Z from chromatin 32 ( Obri et al . , 2014 ) , less is known about H2A . Z eviction mechanism . 33 34 M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 20 The broad pattern of activated HSFA1a we observe spreading across the gene 1 body , beyond the predicted HSEs , is consistent with a role for HSFA1a in 2 activating otherwise quiescent chromatin in a pioneer TF style of action ( Fujimoto 3 et al . , 2012 ) . It is also worth noting that HSF signal in gene bodies has already 4 been observed for a few genes in mammals and drosophila ( Gonsalves et al . , 5 2011 ; Mahat et al . , 2016 ) and that DAP - seq peaks for HSF TFs have been seen to 6 be enriched in 5’UTR and CDS of genes ( O ' Malley et al . , 2016 ) . In 7 Chlamydomonas , HSF1 plays a key role in preventing gene silencing and 8 maintains nearby loci in a transcriptional responsive state ( Strenkert et al . , 2013 ) . 9 It will be of interest to determine the temperature dependent event activating 10 HSFA1a that triggers this large - scale and rapid reprogramming of the 11 transcriptome , as well as the mechanism by which H2A . Z - nucleosome can be 12 rapidly removed and re - inserted into chromatin at temperature responsive loci . 13 14 Methods 15 Plant materials and growth conditions 16 We constructed FLAG tagged HTA11 ( AT3G54560 ) and HSFA1a ( AT4G17750 ) 17 lines under the native promoters , which were used for H2A . Z and HSF1 ChIP 18 experiments . The HTA11 and HSFA1a genomic clones were isolated from Col - 0 , 19 tagged with a 3×FLAG epitopes directly upstream to the stop codons . The vectors 20 were transformed into Col - 0 WT plants . The QK hsfA1a / b / d / e mutant and its 21 corresponding TK wild type , as well as a arp6 - 1 mutant were described previously 22 ( Deal et al . , 2005 ; Liu et al . , 2011 ) . Seedlings were grown at constant 17°C in solid 23 1X Murashige and Skoog ( MS ) media in long days for H2A . Z , H3 , H2B and H2A 24 ChIP - seq as well as all the RNA - seq experiments , and in short days for the HSF1 25 ChIP - seq . The seedlings were grown through a nylon mesh and for temperature 26 shift , transferred to liquid MS media pre - incubated at 17°C ( control ) , 22°C , 27°C , 27 37°C at 1 h after dawn . The plant samples were coll ected at the shift ( 0 min ) as 28 well as 15 min , 1 h , and 4 h after the shift ( Supplemental Figure 1A ) . For arp6 - 1 29 mutant , seedlings were harvested after 15 min “mock” shift from 17°C in solid 30 media to 17°C in liquid media . 31 32 33 M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 21 RNA - seq library preparation 1 Total RNA was isolated from 30 mg of ground seedlings . RNA quality and integrity 2 were assessed on the Agilent 2200 TapeStation . Library preparation was 3 performed using 1 µg of high integrity total RNA ( RIN > 8 ) using the TruSeq 4 Stranded mRNA library preparation kit and TruSeq RNA Library Preparation Kit v2 5 ( Illumina , RS - 122 - 2101 and RS - 122 - 2001 ) . The libraries were sequenced on a 6 HiSeq2000 using paired - end sequencing of 100 bp in length and NextSeq500 7 using paired - end sequencing of 75 bp in length . 8 9 RNA - seq mapping and differential expression analysis 10 The raw reads obtained from the sequencing facilities were analyzed using a 11 combination of publicly available software and in - house scripts described in 12 Supplemental Methods . No mis - match was allowed when mapping using Tophat , 13 except for the QK hfsa1abde mutant and its corresponding TK WT for which data 14 were analyzed for reads mapped with no mis - match as well with 4 mis - matches 15 allowed , to account for potential discrepancies between the reference Col - 0 16 genome , which was also used to map TK WT and QK mutant , which contain parts 17 of Ws genome . The genes whose transcription affected by temperature 18 ( “temperature - responsive” genes ) were identified using DESeq ( Anders and 19 Huber , 2010 ) through R Bioconductor . Further analyses on these genes were 20 performed using their TPM values ( Wagner et al . , 2012 ) , where different number 21 of reads in libraries and transcript lengths were taken into account and normalized . 22 The TPM values of different samples were normalized by those from the zero time 23 point . Raw reads and process files were deposited on Gene Expression Omnibus 24 ( GSE79355 ) . Hierarchical clustering of transcriptomic data was performed using 25 the statistical programme R ( R Development Core Team , 2011 ) . Over - represented 26 biological functions of temperature mis - regulated genes were assessed using 27 GOrilla ( Eden et al . , 2009 ) . 28 29 ChIP and ChIP - seq library preparation 30 ChIP experiment was performed as described ( Gendrel et al . , 2002 ) with minor 31 modifications described in Supplemental Methods . In - house library preparation 32 was done using the TruSeq ChIP sample preparation kit ( Illumina , IP - 202 - 1012 ) 33 M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 22 following the manufacturer’s instructions . The libraries were sequenced on 1 HiSeq2000 and NextSeq500 . 2 3 4 Analyses of ChIP - seq and nucleosome profiles 5 Sequenced ChIP - seq data were analyzed in house , following the same quality 6 control and pre - processing as in RNA - seq . The read counts mapped to each bp in 7 each sample were normalized by the sample’s genome - wide mappable reads 8 coverage per bp , and used in the subsequent statistical analyses . The 9 nucleosome and ChIP profiles were binned to generate “pile - up” ChIP profiles for 10 different groups of genes / promoters using in - house R and Perl scripts . 11 Nucleosome positioning and occupancy was determined using DANPOS ( Chen et 12 al . , 2013 ) . Plus one ( + 1 ) nucleosomes were defined as the first nucleosome found 13 downstream from TSS , but not more than 250 bp from TSS . Peaks of HSFA1a 14 ChIP - seq were called using MACS ( Zhang et al . , 2008 ) . 15 16 In vitro Chromatin Immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) 17 Seedlings expressing gHTA11 : : HTA11 - 3xFlag were grown in liquid 0 . 5X MS 18 medium supplemented with 1 % sucrose and vitamin B for 7 days at 22°C in long 19 days and shifted to 17°C , 3 days prior to the mater ial collection . The plant material 20 was collected 1 h after dawn and immediately flash - frozen in liquid nitrogen . Nuclei 21 were purified as previously described ( Folta and Kaufman , 2006 ) . The chromatin 22 was digested with MNase to obtain mononucleosomes and an aliquot was taken 23 as “Input before IP” . HTA11 - 3xFlag containing nucleosomes have been purified by 24 immunoprecipitation and divided into 5 tubes : “Input after IP” , “17°C 15min” , “17°C 25 1h” , “27°C 15min” , “27°C 1h” ( Supplemental Figure 8 C ) . Input after IP sample was 26 eluted with 100ng / µl of 3XFLAG in TE buffer . Other samples were incubated at 27 17°C or 27°C for 15 min or 1 h before washes . The n ucleosomes were released 28 with 100ng / µl of 3XFLAG in TE buffer . 29 30 In vitro nucleosome stability analysis by Single molecule FRET 31 A 155 bp DNA template containing a single 601 nucleosome positioning sequence 32 with two fluorophores was generated by PCR . In all DNA constructs the donors 33 and acceptors were separated by 76 - 81 bp ( ~ 24 nm ) , and positioned so that the 34 M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 23 FRET pair are close together in space in reconstituted nucleosomes . This way , the 1 signal of the acceptor fluorophore is strong when the nucleosome is closed , and 2 this signal is reduced when the nucleosome is destabilized ( Supplemental Figure 3 8E ) . Two DNA constructs were generated : one with a FRET pair at the 4 nucleosome extreme to measure DNA breathing ( position Z ) , and the other at 27 5 bp from one nucleosome end to measure the nucleosome stability ( Y ) . WT 6 Arabidopsis thaliana H2A , H2A . Z , H2B , H3 and H4 histones were expressed in E . 7 coli and purified as described previously ( Robinson et al . , 2008 ) , and reconstituted 8 by refolding an equimolar mixture of each of the four denatured histones by 9 dialysis against a buffer containing 2 M NaCl . The intact histone octamers were 10 fractionated from histone tetramers and hexamers by size - exclusion 11 chromatography as described ( Robinson et al . , 2008 ) . Two samples containing 12 H2A and H2A . Z - Nucleosomes were mounted simultaneously on a 2 - well culture 13 insert ( Ibidi ) of two confined chambers . Samples and slides were equilibrated to 14 reach desired temperature before mounting or after changing the temperature of 15 the setup . Bursts of fluorescence were detected using the method described 16 previously by Buning and co - workers ( Buning et al . , 2015 ) . 17 18 Prediction of heat - shock elements ( HSEs ) , regulatory motifs and target 19 genes 20 Potential regulatory sequences of heat - shock proteins ( HSEs ) were predicted 21 based on the consensus binding motifs using FIMO ( Grant et al . , 2011 ) , as part of 22 the MEME suite ( Bailey et al . , 2009 ) . The HSE motifs and other plant TFs were 23 analyzed using Protein Binding Microarray ( PBM ) by Franco - Zorrilla and co - 24 workers ( Franco - Zorrilla et al . , 2014 ) , whereas that of NF - Y was from the JASPAR 25 database ( Mathelier et al . , 2014 ) . Target genes were identified using 26 PeakAnalyzer where their TSS are within 1 kb from the predicted TF binding sites 27 or the peaks of ChIP - seq ( Salmon - Divon et al . , 2010 ) . 28 29 Accession numbers 30 Sequence data from this article can be found in the Gene Expression Omnibus 31 under accession number ( GSE79355 ) . 32 33 M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 24 Acknowledgements 1 The authors have no conflicts of interest .

Recruitment timing 15 and dynamics of transcription factors at the Hsp70 loci in living cells . 16 Molecular cell 40 : 965 - 975 . 17 18 19 Figure Legends 20 Figure 1 - HSFA1 transcription factor family is regulating the transcriptional 21 response to ambient temperature 22 A Transcriptional patterns and dynamics of temperature - responsive genes 23 ( 1 , 035 genes ) in response to ambient temperature shift ( 17 o C to 27 o C ) in Col - 0 24 WT . The temperature - responsive genes were hierarchically clustered into six 25 groups , based on the log2 ratio to the zero time point of transcript per million 26 ( TPM ) values . Up - regulated genes are in yellow and down - regulated genes are in 27 purple . The first sidebar to the left of the heatmap indicates the six clusters of 28 temperature responsive genes . The second sidebar indicates target genes of 29 HSFA1a at 27 o C based on HSFA1a ChIP - seq performed on seedlings shifted for 30 15min from 17 o C to 27 o C . 31 M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 33 B Average RNA Pol II occupancy profiles at TSS and TTS of cluster 6 genes 1 ( solid ) and genome average ( dotted ) at 17 o C ( pink for cluster 6 , grey for all genes ) 2 and after 15min of shift to 27 o C ( red for cluster 6 , black for all genes ) . 3 C Transcriptional patterns in the QK hsfa1abde mutant . The genes and 4 clusters are in the same order as in Figure 1A . 5 D Transcriptional patterns in the TK wild - type control , keeping the same order 6 of genes and clusters as for Col - 0 WT in Figure 1A . As the QK hsfa1abde mutant 7 genome is a combination of the Ws and Col - 0 backgrounds ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) , we 8 used the TK WT as a control as it was generated at the same time and thus 9 serves as a suitable reference ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) . 10 E Transcriptional changes between the QK hsfa1abde mutant and the TK 11 wild - type control ( log2 ( QK / TK ) for each time point and temperature shift ) . The 12 genes and clusters are in the same order as in Figure 1A . 13 14 Figure 2 - HSFA1a transcription factor binding is increasing at 27 o C at the 15 cluster 6 genes 16 A Boxplot of changes for HSFA1a signal in the gene body between 17 o C and 17 27 o C after 15 min for genes in each temperature - responsive cluster . HSFA1a ChIP 18 signal increases after temperature shift to 27 o C specifically for cluster 6 genes 19 ( Wilcoxon test P - value < 2 . 2e - 16 when comparing cluster 6 genes to genes in 20 clusters 1 - 5 ) . Non - overlapping notches indicate significant differences between 21 populations’ medians . 22 B Genome - wide average HSFA1a binding profiles of HSFA1a show a higher 23 HSFA1a occupancy at genes in cluster 6 ( solid , pink ) as compared to at 17°C 24 ( dotted , grey ) . The HSFA1a occupancy markedly increases after 15 min shift to 25 27°C ( solid , red ) , as compared to 17°C ( solid , pink ) , 26 C Gene - by - gene HSFA1a ChIP signal of cluster 6 genes at 27°C . Red dots 27 indicate predicted HSEs from a known consensus motif . 28 D Correlation between changes in transcripts level ( TPMs ) and HSFA1a 29 signal after 15min of shift from 17°C to 27°C . A strong positive correlation is 30 observed between increase in transcripts level and HSFA1a signal for cluster 6 31 genes ( red ) , as compared to an equal number of random genes from other 32 temperature - responsive gene clusters ( black ) and cluster 2 genes ( blue ) . 33 M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 34 E Comparison of in vivo HSFA1a targets genes with genes losing 1 temperature response in the QK hsfa1abde mutant that are either in the cluster 6 2 ( left ) or in clusters 1 - 5 ( right ) . Of all the 147 temperature - rapid - response genes 3 ( cluster 6 ) , 83 ( ~ 56 % ) become temperature - irresponsive in the QK mutant as 4 compared to the TK wild - type . Temperature responsiveness is defined by 5 log2 ( TPM 27 o C 15 min / TPM 17 o C 15 mins ) > = 0 . 5 , or the TPM 27 o C at 15 mins is 6 less than 2 ( undetectable ) , while TPM 17 o C at 15 mins is not . Of these 83 genes , 7 48 ( ~ 58 % ) are shown to be direct targets of HSFA1a ( Fisher’s exact test P - value < 8 2 . 2e - 16 ) , signifying the crucial role of HSFA1a and other TFs in the HSFA families 9 in transcriptional regulation temperature rapid responsive genes . For other 10 temperature responsive genes ( cluster 1 - 5 ) , 35 out of 111 ( ~ 32 % ) of genes losing 11 temperature - responsiveness are direct targets of HSFA1a . Note that there are 12 1 , 371 genes ( ~ 5 % ) predicted as targets of HSFA1a in the Arabidopsis genome . 13 F Representation of the transcriptional cascade in the clusters 1 - 6 genes 14 ( bottom ) by the TFs that are in the cluster 6 and are HSFA1a targets ( top ) . The 15 direct targets of these TFs were determined based on the available DAP - seq 16 dataset ( O’Malley et al . , 2016 ) and are represented in red stripes for each cluster 17 ( bottom ) . The linkers and asterisks indicates the temperature - responsive clusters 18 whose members are significantly enriched in target genes of these temperature - 19 responsive TFs . Known positive and negative regulatory relationships are 20 indicated by arrows and blunt arrows , respectively . HSFB2A / B , EPR1 , bZIP28 , 21 DREB2A and At3g10113 TFs in the cluster 6 are transcriptionally activated by 22 HSFA1a , and they themselves regulate downstream temperature responsive 23 targets . 24 25 Figure 3 - HTA11 ChIP signal is transiently reduced at cluster 6 genes in 26 response to the shift to 27°C 27 A Dynamic profiles of + 1 HTA11 ChIP ( used to represent H2A .

A rapid loss of H2A . Z - 2 nucleosome occupancy is observed among the rapid temperature - responsive 3 genes at 15 min ( cluster 6 , highlighted by white box ) . 4 C Changes for HTA11 signal at the TSS between 17 o C and 27 o C after 15 min 5 for all genes in each temperature - responsive gene cluster . A strong reduction of 6 HTA11 signal at 27 o C is specifically observed in cluster 6 genes ( Wilcoxon test P - 7 value < 2 . 2e - 16 when comparing cluster 6 genes to genes in clusters 1 - 5 ) . Non - 8 overlapping notches indicate significant differences between populations’ medians . 9 D Negative correlation between HTA11 occupancy at TSS and transcriptional 10 changes ( as TPMs ) in response to 15 min shift from 17°C to 27°C for all 11 temperature - responsive genes ( black ) , and most prominently in cluster 6 genes 12 ( red ) . 13 E Average HTA11 occupancy profiles among the temperature - responsive 14 genes in cluster 6 ( solid ) , and genome - wide average ( dotted ) . The loss of + 1 15 H2A . Z - containing nucleosomes after 15 min shift to 27°C is observed only in 16 cluster 6 genes ( red compared to pink ) . 17 F Two subgroups of genes can be observed in the cluster 6 based on HTA11 18 dynamics in the plants shifted from 17°C to 27°C fo r 15min : 6A ( red ) , which exhibit 19 a predominant loss of H2A . Z occupancy at the + 1 nucleosomes , as well as into the 20 gene bodies , and 6B ( orange ) without any clear H2A . Z pattern . 21 G Average profiles of H2A . Z - containing nucleosomes of the genes in sub - 22 class 6A ( pink ) , is higher than for genes in sub - class 6B ( orange ) , and the 23 genome - wide average ( dotted black ) . 24 H Average transcriptional changes of temperature - responsive genes ( log2 25 ratio of TPMs normalized to the zero time point ) for the sub - classes 6A ( orange for 26 17°C and green for 27°C ) and 6B ( blue for 17°C and purple for 27°C ) in Col - 0 WT , 27 which were previously identified by the re - clustering of cluster 6 genes based on 28 HTA11 dynamics . The dynamic of transcriptional activation is stronger in genes of 29 the sub - class 6A , notably because of a lower baseline transcriptional level 30 compare to the sub - class 6B . 31 32 Figure 4 - Promoter architecture of temperature rapid response genes may 33 facilitate transcriptional activation 34 M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 36 A Predicted Heat Shock binding Elements ( HSEs ) are specifically enriched in 1 temperature - responsive gene clusters 6 , particularly within + / - 100bp upstream of 2 TSS ( Fisher’s exact test P - value < 2 . 2e - 16 ) . The same is not observed in other 3 temperature - responsive genes . 4 B Predicted HSEs ( dashed ) , and those confirmed and filtered by ChIP - seq 5 evidence of HSFA1a from this study ( solid ) , are specifically enriched in rapid 6 temperature - responsive gene clusters 6 ( red ) , just upstream of the + 1 7 nucleosome . The same is not observed in other genes in the genome ( black ) . 8 C ChIP - filtered HSEs are enriched in temperature - responsive gene clusters 6 9 around TSS . For the target genes of HSFA1a with ChIP - seq peaks ( 17 o C ChIP in 10 pink and 27 o C ChIP in red ) within 500bp from TSS , predicted HSEs are specifically 11 enriched within + / - 100bp upstream of TSS , as compared to HSEs found in other 12 genes ( 17 o C ChIP in grey and 27 o C ChIP in black ) . 13 D Predicted HSEs ( dashed ) around + 1 nucleosome for cluster 2 genes . HSEs 14 are also enriched in this cluster , but without a clear positioning pattern in relation 15 to the + 1 nucleosome as in cluster 6 ( Figure 4B ) 16 E Changes for HTA11 signal at the TSS between 17 o C and 27 o C after 15 min 17 for all genes , genes in clusters 1 - 5 and genes in cluster 6 with our without HSEs . A 18 strong reduction of HTA11 signal at 27 o C is specifically observed in cluster 6 19 genes with HSEs compared to genes in all other clusters ( Wilcoxon test P - values 20 < 2 . 2e - 16 ) , or even to cluster 6 genes without HSEs ( P - value = 8 . 0e - 4 ) . 21 F In the sub - cluster 6A , comparison of genes with HSEs with genes showing 22 a reduction of H2A .

Transcriptional activation is 30 also observed for genes in cluster 6 ( highlighted with white box ) . Up - regulated 31 genes are in yellow and down - regulated genes are in purple . 32 B Transcriptional patterns in Col - 0 WT seedlings shifted from 12ºC to 37ºC . 33 Transcriptional activation of the cluster 6 genes is stronger and persist longer 34 M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 37 when shifted to 37°C as compared to 27°C ( highlight ed with white box ) . 1 C Gene - by - gene HSFA1a ChIP signal of cluster 6 genes at 37°C . Further 2 recruitment of HSF1 to the promoters and genes bodies of the cluster 6A genes 3 resulted in elevated HSF1 occupancy at 37°C . Red do ts indicate predicted HSEs 4 from a known consensus motif . 5 D Dynamic profiles of HTA11 ChIP signal around the TTS of temperature - 6 responsive genes Col - 0 WT shifted from 12ºC to 37ºC . In plants shifted to 37°C , 7 the H2A . Z eviction for cluster 6 genes ( highlighted with white box ) is stronger than 8 shifting to 27°C and takes longer to be incorporate d back into the nucleosomes 9 ( after 4 h ) .

Z - containing nucleosome in 13 the transcriptional response to temperature at cluster 6 genes . 14 A Changes of transcriptional levels ( TPMs ) among the cluster 6 genes are 15 highly correlated with changes in HSF1 and HTA11 occupancies in response to 16 15min of shift from 17ºC to 27ºC . This is particularly clear in the sub - class 6A 17 ( red ) , and less so for 6B ( orange ) . 18 B ChIP - qPCR for HTA9 in the QK hsfA1a / b / d / e mutant and TK wild - type at 19 HSP70 and AT3G12590 , which is a negative control for H2A .

Z eviction at HSP70 in 22 response to temperature shift is not anymore observed in the QK hsfA1a / b / d / e 23 mutant at 27°C ( red arrow ) . Error bars represent th e standard errors of three 24 technical replicates . The second biological replicate can be found in Figure S8B . 25 C ) A model of transcriptional regulation of rapidly temperature responsive 26 genes ( cluster 6 ) . At a low ambient growth temperature ( 17°C ) , HSFA1a is 27 detectable at the promoters of the rapidly temperature responsive genes at a low 28 level and at a small fraction of its target genes , insufficient to trigger transcriptional 29 activation in Col - 0 WT . Tightly bound H2A . Z - nucleosome , especially at the + 1 30 position of these genes , may play a role to help restrict transcriptional activation at 31 lower temperatures . At elevated ambient temperature ( 27°C ) , HSF1 is transiently 32 further recruited to HSEs around the TSS as well as to the gene bodies of the 33 targets , an event concomitant with depletion of H2A . Z from these regions and this 34 M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P TE D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 38 is accompanied by robust transcriptional activation . The strong correlation 1 between transcriptional activation , H2A .
