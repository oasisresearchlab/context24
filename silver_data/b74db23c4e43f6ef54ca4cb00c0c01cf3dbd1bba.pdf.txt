Mooney 1 , 3 * Stem cells sense and respond to the mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix . However , both the extent to which extracellular - matrix mechanics affect stem - cell fate in three - dimensional microenvironments and the underlying biophysical mechanisms are unclear . We demonstrate that the commitment of mesenchymal stem - cell populations changes in response to the rigidity of three - dimensional microenvironments , with osteogenesis occurring predominantly at 11 – 30 kPa . In contrast to previous two - dimensional work , however , cell fate was not correlated with morphology . Instead , matrix stiffness regulated integrin binding as well as reorganization of adhesion ligands on the nanoscale , both of which were traction dependent and correlated with osteogenic commitment of mesenchymal stem - cell populations . These ﬁndings suggest that cells interpret changes in the physical properties of adhesion substrates as changes in adhesion - ligand presentation , and that cells themselves can be harnessed as tools to mechanically process materials into structures that feed back to manipulate their fate . C ell therapies hold great clinical promise , but control of transplanted - cell fate remains a significant challenge 1 . Material - based transplantation systems offer a promising means to control cell fate for regeneration of functional tissue or controlled disease ablation 2 , 3 . As cell / matrix interactions are central to eukaryote biology 4 , 5 , these materials systems are often designed to exploit those interactions to manipulate cell fate , typically through presentation of integrin - binding ligands ( for example , RGD ) derived from natural extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins 6 – 9 . Interestingly , in vitro studies with such synthetic ECM analogues have demonstrated that in two - dimensional ( 2D ) cultures cell fate can also be manipulated by changing the rigidity of the substrate without altering ligand presentation 10 , 11 . However , although this previous work has identified important correlations between matrix rigidity and cell phenotype , the biophysical mechanisms that enable cells to sense matrix compliance remain unclear . Moreover , as most work linking substrate mechanics to cell fate has been done in 2D model systems , the extent to which ECM rigidity affects cell phenotype in more physiologically relevant three - dimensional ( 3D ) culture systems is also uncertain 12 – 14 . We first tested the effects of 3D matrix rigidity on commitment of a clonally derived murine mesenchymal stem - cell ( mMSC ) line , D1 ( refs 15 , 16 ) , as clonally derived cell lines provide more definitive information regarding fate decisions than heterogeneous primary cell populations . The relative homogeneity of mMSCs compared with primary human MSCs ( hMSCs ) was confirmed through histology , as significant numbers of cells in the naïve hMSC population ( 10 ± 2 % ) exhibited alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) activity ( a marker of osteogenesis ) , compared with less than 1 % in the naïve mMSC population ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . Naïve D1 cells were encapsulated into 3D hydrogel synthetic ECM formed by alginate polymers that present integrin - binding RGD peptides 17 .

S2 ) , and the density of RGD was varied in parallel . The broad range of peptide density used in our studies is comparable to the RGD density of commonly used biological matrices , including tumour - derived ECM ( 140 µ M ; ref . 13 ) . As the matrices used in these studies are not susceptible to enzymatic degradation by mammalian cells , their mechanical properties are expected to remain constant over the course of differentiation studies . Thus , any observed effects of E on cell fate can be distinguished from indirect effects stemming from matrix degradation , which in and of itself has been linked to cell fate in previous work 18 , 19 . Cell phenotype was analysed 1 week after encapsulation , and this revealed that matrix rigidity had significant effects on clonally derived mMSC phenotype , with osteogenic commitment occurring primarily at intermediate E ( 11 – 30 kPa ) and adipogenic lineage predominating in softer ( 2 . 5 – 5 kPa ) microenvironments ( Fig . 1a ) . The generality of the relationship between matrix elasticity and stem - cell fate was confirmed by studies in which mMSCs were encapsulated into RGD - modified agarose 20 or poly ( ethylene glycol dimethacrylate ) 21 hydrogels of varying rigidity ( Supplementary Fig . S2 ) . Consistent with results obtained in alginate - based syn - thetic ECM , mMSCs underwent optimal osteogenic commitment within matrices of intermediate stiffness ( Fig . 1b , c ) . Histological results were verified by analysis of the expression of osteogenic biomarkers core binding factor α 1 ( Cbfa - 1 ) , osteopontin ( OPN ) and osteocalcin ( OCN ) , and adipogenic biomarkers peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma ( PPAR - γ ) and adiponectin ( Adn ) ( Fig . 1d , e , SupplementaryFig . S1 ) . Similarresultswerefound at two different RGD densities ( 754 and 189 µ M ; Fig . 1e ) . These studies were next repeated with primary hMSCs to confirm their physiologic relevance .

Scale bars : a , 100 µ m ; b , c , 50 µ m ; d , 20 µ m . hMSCs were consistent with trends observed using the clonally derived mMSC line , with osteogenesis occurring most prevalently within matrices of intermediate rigidity and high RGD density ( Fig . 1f , Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . However , hMSCs exhibited more heterogeneous lineage commitment in response to ECM mechanical properties , consistent with the baseline heterogeneity of the naive cell population ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . Together , these results from clonally derived and primary stem - cell populations are consistent with the hypothesis that matrix elasticity modulates stem - cell lineage specification in 3D culture . Further studies would determine whether this same phenomenon holds for other lineages and stem - cell types . Our findings also agree with previous reports detailing the effects of specific values of E on osteogenic specification in 2D culture 10 , 11 , and a recent study that reported hMSC differentiation was influenced by matrix elasticity in 3D culture 22 . However , the specific modulus found optimal for osteogenesis in the recent 3D cell culture report was distinct from our findings and the previous 2D culture studies , perhaps owing to the different metrics used to examine differentiation in that study , ortheshear - thinningnatureofthematerialsusedinthatwork 22 . Having establishing a role for matrix elasticity in regulating MSC phenotype in 3D culture , we investigated potential underlying mechanisms . In 3D matrices , MSC lineage commitment may be affected by small molecules ( for example , calcium ions ) used to control E . This possibility was addressed by carrying out studies in which the concentration of available calcium ions was decoupled from the rigidity of the matrix encapsulating cells . In those studies , mMSC fate correlated with matrix stiffness , not the amount of soluble calcium ( Supplementary Fig . S3 ) . A second possibility is that altering matrix mechanics regulates diffusion of instructive morphogens 23 . However , direct measurements of the relative diffusion coefficient ( D eff ) for a model protein , revealed no statistically significant changes within the E range of alginate matrices used in this work ( Supplementary Fig . S3 ) . Hence , changes in morphogen diffusion alone are unlikely to underlie the observed dependence of cell fate on E .

E values shown are for hydrogels at the time of cell encapsulation . Scale bars : 10 µ m . The relation between cell morphology and fate in 3D culture was next examined , as it has often been observed in 2D culture studies that matrix rigidity affects cell morphology 24 , 25 , and morphology in and of itself has been correlated to hMSC fate 26 . Strikingly , though , E had no significant affects on gross mMSC morphology in 3D matrices either after a short time ( 2 h ) ( Fig . 2a , Supplementary Fig . S4 ) , or at later ( 24 h and 1 week ; data not shown ) time - points , and cells appeared to be grossly spherical . This finding is consistent with recent work using other hydrogels with nanometre - scale pore sizes to encapsulate cells 27 . Phalloidin staining revealed micrometre - sized cortical protrusions of the cells intothesurroundingmatrix ( SupplementaryFig . S4 , Fig . 2b ) . These protrusions were only present in RGD - modified alginate , and were eliminated by treating mMSC with a cell - traction - inhibiting agent , ( 2 , 3 ) - butanedione - monoxime ( Supplementary Fig . S4 ) . However , no strong correlations were observed between these protrusions and matrix elasticity . Likewise , although there was a subtle decrease in nuclear sphericity ( ψ ) and volume ( V N ) as E increased , there was no statistically significant relationship between E and either parameter ( Fig . 2c , Supplementary Fig . S4 ) . These findings contrast with reports correlating nuclear morphology to osteogenesis in 2D culture 28 , though different metrics were used to quantify nuclear morphology in the present 3D study as compared with the aforementioned 2D work . Importantly , these data relating matrix elasticity to cell morphology contrast with previous 2D studies that suggested that gross cell - morphology changes are required to alter MSC fate in response to substrate rigidity 10 , 24 . However , our data are consistent with reports of in vivo versus in vitro morphology of other cell types . For example , fibroblasts exhibit marked changes in spreading as the rigidity of 2D culture substrates is modulated 25 , but show how a characteristic , spindle - shaped morphology in 3D matrix culture and in vivo , even though the tissues where they reside exhibit large disparities in compliance and adhesion ligand presentation 12 . As neither cell nor nuclear morphology seemed to be re - quired for MSC fate changes in response to the rigidity of 3D microenvironments—in particular , the biphasic relationship be - tween E and osteogenic commitment of MSC , alternative means for cellular mechanosensing were next investigated . Previous work identifying molecular sensors of ECM rigidity has concentrated on deformation of extracellular adhesion molecules or of proteins that comprise the focal adhesion complex within the cell 5 , 29 – 33 . However , there has been little focus on the bimolecular interactions between the matrix and integrins , despite previous work 34 , 35 suggesting that matrix rigidity and adhesion - ligand density act in concert to regulate fate . We thus hypothesized that changes in substrate stiffness alter cell fate , at least partially , by directly modulating integrin / adhesion - ligand bond formation . This possibility is sup - ported by the finding that mechanical forces can directly affect the lifetime of bimolecular bonds 36 , and models that predict a biphasic relationship between applied force and bond lifetime 37 – 39 . It is also possible that cells may use different integrin receptors as stiffness and dimensionality of the matrix are varied 12 . In 2D culture , clonally derived mMSCs used α V integrins to adhere to monolayers of either fibronectin ( FN ) or vitronectin ( lacking the PHSRN ‘synergy sequence’ of FN purported to be essential for α 5 β 1 - integrin ligation 40 ) , but only used α 5 integrins when adherent toFN ( Fig . 3a ) . However , inthreedimensions , α 5 integrinslocalized to the cell / matrix interface in an RGD - dependent manner ( Fig . 3b ) , suggesting they were being used for adhesion . An enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) technique was developed to directly address the possibility of α 5 - integrin - mediated adhesion in three dimensions , and to quantitatively compare specific integrin ligation by cells within or on compliant RGD - modified hydrogels ( Supple - mentary Fig . S5 ) . ELISA quantification revealed that , in 2D culture , α V integrins acted as RGD receptors , but α 5 integrins did not ( Fig . 3c ) . However , mMSC encapsulated within 3D matrices with the same E and RGD density did use α 5 integrins as RGD receptors ( Fig . 3c ) . The maximum number of α V – RGD bonds did not change significantly between 2D and 3D matrices presenting high densities of ligand , implying that α 5 – RGD binding in 3D culture is not simply a consequence of α V - integrin saturation . Strikingly , analysis of integrin ligation in 3D matrices with varying E revealed a biphasic relationship between α 5 – RGD bonds and E that peaked at 22 kPa , correlating with osteogenic commitment ( Fig . 3d ) . α V integrins showed a similar biphasic relationship between matrix stiffness and RGD binding and peaked at 22 kPa in three dimensions ( data not shown ) . In contrast to the biphasic relationship between E and integrin – RGD bond formation observed in three dimensions , when mMSCs were cultured in two dimensions on alginate substrates the number of RGD – α V - integrin bonds increased in a hyperbolic fashion as matrix stiffness was raised , with no statistically significant 520 NATUREMATERIALS | VOL 9 | JUNE 2010 | www . nature . com / naturematerials © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Adhesion assays were carried out at an early time - point ( 2 h ) after encapsulation or seeding of cells , to minimize the influence of changes in cellular gene expression on bond formation . To provide an absolute measure of bond formation between integrins and RGD presented by 3D hydrogels , to complement the relative values obtained biochemically , and to enable a broader examination of the variable space modulating RGD – integrin ligation , we used a non - invasive technique based on Förster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ; refs 41 – 43 ) between amembrane - intercalating fluorescein dye and rhodamine - labelled peptides ( Fig . 4a , Supplementary Fig . S6 ) . The intensity of fluorescein emission at the cell / matrix interface diminished in the presence of integrin - binding RGD adhesion peptides owing to FRET , but not with control RGE peptides ( Fig . 4a ) , as in previous work 41 , confirming this technique as a specific measure of cell – RGD bonds . Likewise , emission spectra of entire hydrogels ( ∼ 10 6 cells ) indicated FRET between cells and RGD , with the magnitude of energy transfer depending on matrix rigidity ( Supplementary Fig . S6 ) . The number of mMSC – RGD bonds per cell ( N b ) calculated from FRET measurements of cell - encapsulating hydrogels indicated that bond formation was regulated by both the density of available RGD and matrix rigidity ( Fig . 4b , c ) . As in ELISA studies of relative integrin – RGD ligation , the relationship between N b and E was biphasic and correlated with osteogenesis , with optimal RGD ligation at 22 kPa . Even when high densities of peptide ( 150 µ M RGD ) were presented , a similar , albeit diminished , relationship was noted ( Fig . 4b , c ) . The decreased dependence of N b on E observed for N b exceeding 1 . 4 × 10 5 bonds / cell contrasts with the biochemical analysis ( Fig . 3d ) , suggesting saturation of the FRET signal at very high RGD densities . The biphasic relationship between N b and matrix rigidity was maintained as E was varied over a wide range using a variety of differentpolymersandcrosslinkingmolecules ( Fig . 4d ) . Incontrast , there was virtually no correlation between N b and the concentration of calcium used to crosslink certain hydrogels ( Supplementary Fig . S7 ) , suggesting that changes in N b and correlated osteogenic specification reported here are not secondary to changes in matrix - associated calcium . Importantly , the impact of matrix compliance on bond formation was lost when cells were treated with ( 2 , 3 ) - butanedione - monoxime ( Fig . 4e ) , indicating that cell contractility is necessary for matrix mechanics to regulate integrin binding . These findings are consistent with reports indicating that mechanosensing is an active process that requires cell traction NATUREMATERIALS | VOL 9 | JUNE 2010 | www . nature . com / naturematerials 521 © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

As in other adhesion studies , FRET measurements of bond formation were made at an early time - point ( 2 h ) after encapsulating cells into hydrogels . Control experiments carried out with cyclohexamide - treated cells confirmed that protein synthesis did not affect cell – RGD bond formation ( Fig . 4e ) . An additional role for cell contractility in controlling bond number was next revealed by studying peptide clustering by the matrix - encapsulated cells . With nanoporous hydrogel substrates , it is typical to assume that cells are capable of binding any adhesion molecules that lie within 5 – 10 nm of the plasma membrane 44 . However , a direct comparison of the number of bound integrins measured by FRET with the density of RGD within the matrix surrounding mMSCs revealed that , if the RGD distribution within the alginate matrix remained homogenous , cells would have to probe nearly 50 nm into the surrounding material to access the needed number of peptides ( Fig . 5a , b ) . Thus , it seemed likely that cells used traction forces to mechanically reorganize the RGD peptides presented by these hydrogel matrices on the nanometre scale , clustering RGD near integrins whereas the peptides remain bound to the material ( Fig . 5c ) —a process somewhat analogous to traction - mediated unfolding of fibronectin , which subsequently re - veals cryptic peptide epitopes 32 . To directly address this possibility , a second FRET technique 11 was used to measure traction - mediated clusteringofRGDbyencapsulatedmMSCs ( Fig . 5d ; Supplementary Fig . S8 ) .

Matrix mechanics and dimensionality may change integrin ligation by a number of different mechanisms , including altered integrin – RGD bond lifetime , and the observed changes in the nanoscale organization of the ECM . It is also possible that intracellular changes in activation and transport of integrins , as well as their binding to focal adhesion components , and the resistance of these intracellular bonds to rupture 46 – 50 , contribute to mechanically dependent integrin ligation in 3D matrix culture . This mechanism may work independently , or more likely in concert NATUREMATERIALS | VOL 9 | JUNE 2010 | www . nature . com / naturematerials 523 © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Becauseofthephysical continuity of integrins with both matrix and focal adhesions , ma - nipulations intended to selectively perturb one of these components ( for example , overexpression of focal adhesion proteins or phar - macological inhibition of cell traction ) are likely to perturb others . This highlights the importance of technologies capable of probing cellular mechanotransduction without mechanically perturbing the system 32 , 33 , 43 , including the FRET assays used in these studies . In 3D culture , endogenous ECM assembly will probably occur , and this may diminish cells’ sensitivity to both the ligand presentation and the elasticity of synthetic ECM analogues . FN synthesis became significant after 5 d of culture , but did not seem to change as a function of matrix elasticity ( Fig . 6a ) . In contrast , collagen I ( Col I ) expression only became significant after one week , and occurred predominantly in matrices that promoted osteogenesis ( Fig . 6a ) . Furthermore , even after 21 d of culture in three dimensions , secretion of osteocalcin ( a hallmark of late osteoblasticdifferentiation ) by mMSCsexhibitedamarkedbiphasic dependence on ECM rigidity ( Fig . 6b ) , whereas Cbfa - 1 expression followed a similar , albeit slightly diminished , trend ( Fig . 6c ) . Together , these data suggest that bonds between RGD and integrins act to trigger lineage - specific protein expression , which persists even in the face of endogenous ECM synthesis . Alternatively , bonds between integrins and RGD coupled to the materials used in these studies may persist , even when there is significant endogenous ECM deposition , and thus provide continuous signalling to cells . Finally , to confirm that within 3D culture mMSC fate was mediated by integrin – RGD bonds , we examined cells encapsulated into RGD - modified matrices of varying rigidity in the presence of function - blocking antibodies against either α 5 integrins or α V integrins . Blocking RGD – integrin bond formation with either antibody did not affect cell viability or proliferation significantly ( Supplementary Fig S9 ) . However , blocking RGD binding to α 5 integrins significantly diminished osteogenesis , and enhanced adipogenesis in an antibody - dose - dependent fashion ( Fig . 6d , Supplementary Fig . S9 ) . Cells were still capable of undergoing osteogenic commitment , although to a greatly 524 NATUREMATERIALS | VOL 9 | JUNE 2010 | www . nature . com / naturematerials © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved . NATURE MATERIALS DOI : 10 . 1038 / NMAT2732 ARTICLES diminished extent , when α V – RGD interactions were blocked ( Fig . 6d , Supplementary Fig . S9 ) . These results are consistent with previous work highlighting roles for both α 5 - and α V - integrin ligation in osteogenesis 51 , 52 . Altogether , the work presented here implicates integrin – adhesion - ligand bonds as morphology - independent sensors of both matrix elasticity and dimensionality . This finding is likely to be broadly important to the biology of a variety of processes , from embryogenesis to cancer 4 , 5 , 13 , 14 , and useful in designing materials to control cell fate for medical applications 2 , 3 . Furthermore , differences in integrin ligation in standard tissue culture versus compliant 3D microenvironments probably partially explain discrepancies often observed between standard 2D tissue culture and in vivo , and highlight the importance of synthetic ECM approaches for both basic investigations and drug screening . In vivo and in vitro , cells actively probe their microenvironment for adhesion ligands by deforming themselves and their matrix on multiple spatiotemporal scales 5 , 29 – 33 . Here , we demonstrate that we can exploit this process to mechanically tune the molecular interface between cells and the matrix , which in turn plays a significant role in determining MSC fate . Our findings suggest that cells interpret mechanically disparate substrates as having different adhesion - ligand presentations , even if their chemical compositions are identical . From an engineering standpoint , cell - traction forces may be harnessed as tools to mechanically tune synthetic materials in situ , generating a new cell / matrix interface , which subsequently contributes to cell - fate decisions . This may present a general strategy to create functionally complex materials from structurally simple templates , as materials processed in this manner would gain functional characteristics inherent to the cells with which they interact . Method summary 3D MSC culture and lineage analysis . Alginates ( FMC Biopolymer ) and agarose were covalently coupled with the integrin - binding peptide ( Gly ) 4 – Arg – Gly – Asp – Ala – Ser – Ser – Lys – Tyr ( Peptides International ; refs 17 , 20 ) . Poly ( ethylene glycol dimethacrylate ) polymers were photo - crosslinked in the presence of acryloyl - polyethylene glycol - Arg – Gly – Asp – Ser ( ref . 21 ) . For cell - encapsulation studies , mixtures of varying weight per cent polymer were mixed with stem cells ( 20 million clonally derived mMSCs ( D1 ) ml − 1 , or 15 million hMSCsml − 1 ) and crosslinked to form hydrogels . The elastic modulus E of hydrogel matrices was measured using an Instron 3342 mechanical apparatus at a compression rate of 1mmmin − 1 . Cell - encapsulating hydrogels were transferred to FBS - supplemented DMEM ( Invitrogen ) containing a combination of osteogenic and adipogenic chemical supplements . After 1 week in culture , lineage specification was assessed by in situ staining for alkaline phosphatase activity ( Fast Blue ) and neutral lipids ( Oil Red O ) in the same samples , by OCN staining in cryosectioned matrices or by biochemical analysis of cell lysates obtained by recovering cells from alginate matrices with 50mM EDTA in PBS . Western analysis of cell phenotype was carried out to assess population - level expression levels of FN and Col I , as well as adipogenic ( PPAR - γ , Adn ) and osteogenic ( Cbfa - 1 , Osteopontin ) biomarkers . In certain experiments , cell - encapsulating , calcium - crosslinked alginate matrices were combined with cell - free alginate matrices in the same media so that theconcentrationofcalciumionsavailabletocellscouldbecontrolledindependentfromtherigidityofcell - encapsulating matrices ( Supplementary Fig . S3 ) . The relative diffusion coefficient for a model protein , BSA ( 67kDa ) , was measured through release of rhodamine - labelled BSA from alginate matrices of varying rigidity ( Supplementary Fig . S3 ) . Biochemical measurements of integrin – adhesion - ligand bond formation . Clonally derived mMSCs ( D1 ) were encapsulated into alginate matrices presenting ( Gly ) 4 – Arg – Gly – Asp – Ala – Ser – Ser – Lys ( biotin ) – Tyr . ( Gly ) 4 – Arg – Gly – Glu – Ala – Ser – Ser – Lys ( biotin ) – Tyr - presenting alginates were used as negative controls . After encapsulating cells , hydrogels were incubated in FBS - supplemented media for 2h . Hydrogels were dissolved into 250 µ gml − 1 alginate lyase , and cell lysates were prepared with RIPA buffer ( Sigma ) . Equal amounts of protein were probed onto NeutrAvidin - coated stripwells ( Thermo Scientific ) , and biotin – RGD - bound integrins were probed by ELISA using polyclonal antibodies against either α 5 - or α V - integrin subunits , horseradish peroxidase - tagged secondary antibodies ( Jackson Immunolabs ) and QuantaBlue fluorogenic horseradish peroxidase substrate ( Thermo Scientific ) . QuantaBlue fluorescence was read in a Biotek plate reader and the relative number of bonds betweenintegrinsandRGDwascalculatedaccordingtoequation ( 1 ) : N b , α X = RFI sample − RFI blank RFI control − RFI blank ( 1 ) where RFI refers to the relative fluorescence intensity of samples , controls or blank ( lysate from cells that were not encapsulated into alginate – RGD – biotin ) . The controlwasa3D , 22kPamatrixmodifiedwith15 µ MRGD – biotin ( Fig . 3c , d ) . FRET measurements of integrin – adhesion - ligand bond formation . FRET analysis of integrin – adhesion - ligand bonds was carried out by monitoring energy transfer between a membrane - intercalating fluorescein dye and rhodamine - labelled peptides as previously described 41 . Clonally derived mMSCs ( D1 ) were labelled with 5 - hexadecanoylaminofluorescein ( Invitrogen ) for 24h , and encapsulated into alginate matrices presenting ( Gly ) 4 – Arg – Gly – Asp – Ala – Ser – Ser – Lys ( tetramethylrhodamine ) – Tyr . ( Gly ) 4 – Arg – Gly – Asp – Glu – Ser – Ser – Lys ( tetramethylrhodamine ) – Tyr peptides were used as negative controls . Hydrogels were formed by mixing cells with various alginate polymers and crosslinking either with CaSO 4 ( calcium – alginate ) or poly ( acrylamide - co - hydrazide ; alginate dialdehyde ) . After encapsulating cells , hydrogels were incubated in FBS - supplemented media for 2h . The emission spectrum from hydrogels was collected using a Fluorimeter ( Jobin Horiba ) with 488nm excitation , and normalized to cell density by dissolving hydrogels into PBS containing 50mmoll − 1 EDTA ( calcium alginate ) or 250 µ gml − 1 alginate lyase ( alginate dialdehyde ) . The degree of energy transfer ( D FRET ) was calculated according to equation ( 2 ) : D FRET = 1 − I I 0 ( 2 ) where I refers to emission intensity at 520nm and I 0 to the 520nm emission intensity in a donor control sample with the same peptide density , elastic modulus and drug treatment but with RGD peptides rather than RGD – tetramethylrhodamine ( TAMRA ) peptides . D FRET was used to calculate the number of integrin – RGD bonds on the basis of a linear calibration curve generated by carrying out parallel FRET - binding and 125 I - RGD - binding studies in solution 41 . FRET between cells and RGD was visualized using a laser scanning confocal microscope ( Zeiss LSM 510 ) . Excitation was provided by an argon laser ( 488nm ) , and fluorescein ( green , 500 – 530nm ) and rhodamine ( red , 565 – 615nm ) emission were collected simultaneously . Images were prepared by overlaying the green and red emission channels . FurtherdetailsareprovidedintheSupplementaryInformation .
