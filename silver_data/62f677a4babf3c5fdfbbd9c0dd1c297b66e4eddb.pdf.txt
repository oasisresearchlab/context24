Mathematical Programming 45 ( 1989 ) 139 - 172 139 North - Holland THE BOOLEAN QUADRIC POLYTOPE : SOME CHARACTERISTICS , FACETS AND RELATIVES Manfred PADBERG Stern School of Business , New York University , Washington Square , New York , NY 10003 , USA Dedicato ad Alan Hoffman in ammirazione per l ' uomo e le sue opere . Received 8 March 1988 Revised manuscript received 28 March 1988 We study unconstrained quadratic zero - one programming problems having n variables from a polyhedral point of view by considering the Boolean quadric polytope QP " in n ( n + l ) / 2 dimensions that results from the linearization of the quadratic form . We show that Qpn has a diameter of one , descriptively identify three families of facets of Qpn and show that Qpn is symmetric in the sense that all facets of QPn can be obtained from those that contain the origin by way of a mapping . The naive linear programming relaxation QP ] ' p of QP " is shown to possess the Trubin - property and its extreme points are shown to be { 0 , ½ , l } - valued . Furthermore , O ( n 3 ) facet - defining inequalities of QP " suffice to cut off all fractional vertices of QP ~ _ p , whereas the family of facets described by us has at least 0 ( 3 " ) members . The problem is also studied for sparse quadratic forms ( i . e . when several or many coefficients are zero ) and conditions are given for the previous results to carry over to this case , Polynomially solvable problem instances are discussed and it is shown that the known polynomiality result for the maximization of nonnegative quadratic forms can be obtained by simply rounding the solution to the linear programming relaxation . In the case that the graph induced by the nonzero coefficients of the quadratic form is series - parallel , a complete linear description of the associated Boolean quadric polytope is given . The relationship of the Boolean quadric polytope associated to sparse quadratic forms with the vertex - packing polytope is discussed as well .

Introduction We consider the unconstrained quadratic zero - one program in n variables max { clx + xTO1x ] x C { 0 , 1 } n } , ( 1 ) where c 1 is a ( rational ) vector of length n and Q ~ is a ( rational ) matrix of size n x n . Observing that x ~ = xi for xi c { 0 , 1 } , one can always bring ( 1 ) into the form max { cx + xTOxlx C { 0 , 1 } " } , ( 2 ) Partial support under NSF Grant Nos .

Padberg / The Boolean quadric polytope where c = ( cl , • • . , cn ) is a vector of length n and Q is a n × n upper - triangular matrix with zero - diagonal , see e . g . Fortet ( 1959 and 1960 ) , Hammer and Rosenberg ( 1964 ) , Hammer ( 1965 ) . If Q = O , then problem ( 2 ) is trivially solvable . Hence we can assume that Q ~ 0 . To " linearize " the quadratic terms x ~ xj we introduce new variables y ~ = x ~ xj ( 3 ) that are zero - one valued and satisfy the following sets of contraints : x ~ + xj - y ~ ~ < 1 , ( 4 ) - x ~ + y ~ / < ~ O , ( 5 ) - xj + YU ~ < 0 , ( 6 ) - Y0 < 0 , ( 7 ) x ~ integer , y ~ : integer , ( 8 ) for all 1 ~ i < j - < n ; see Padberg ( 1978 ) . Similar linearization " tricks " are well - known from the literature ; see Fortet ( 1959 and 1960 ) , Lawler ( 1963 ) , Balas ( 1964 ) and others , see e . g . Hansen ( 1979 ) for a survey . They apply to higher - order polynomials in the variables xl , . . . , xn as well , but here we restrict ourselves to the special case of a quadratic function . Problem ( 1 ) thus becomes the following linear program in zero - one variables : max { cx + F . qoyq [ ( x , y ) satisfies ( 4 ) , . . . , ( 8 ) } ( QP ) i < j which we study in this paper from a polyhedral point of view . Other recent approaches to unconstrained quadratic zero - one programming include works by Hammer , Hansen and Simeone ( 1984 ) , Williams ( 1985 ) , Barahona , Jfinger and Reinelt ( 1987 ) , Conforti , Rao and Sassano ( 1987 ) and Balas and Mazzola ( 1984 ) who study the more general case of higher - order polynomials in n zero - one variables . With the exception of the papers by Barahona et al . who show that ( 1 ) is equivalent to a maximum - cut problem and use polyhedral methods to attack the latter problem , we are not aware of any attempt to solve ( 1 ) directly by polyhedral methods . Conforti et al . address a related problem , the equipartition problem , by polyhedral methods . It is well known that ( 2 ) is NP - hard in general . However , in the special case in which Q is a non - negative matrix and c is arbitrary the problem is solvable in polynomial time , see Balinski ( 1970b ) , Rhys ( 1970 ) , Picard and Ratliff ( 1975 ) , Hansen ( 1979 ) . To analyze ( QP ) we associate to our problem a complete graph K , = ( V , E ) with n vertices and m = n ( n - 1 ) / 2 edges . Every vertex ic V corresponds to a variable xl and every edge e = ( i , j ) to a variable Ye or yo ; we use a single or a double index whenever desirable to index an edge e = ( i , j ) . M . Padberg / The Boolean quadric polytope 141 Clearly , the a priori disadvantage of the linearization ( QP ) of problem ( 1 ) lies in the introduction of the n ( n - 1 ) / 2 " new " variables . However , neither the number of constraints nor the number of variables worry us , see e . g . Padberg and Rinaldi ( 1987 ) for the " implicit " treatment of huge constraints sets in millions of variables in the context of symmetric travelling salesman problems . Also , whenever qo = 0 for some i < j , then an edge e = ( i , j ) need not to be considered and we can work on a sparse subgraph of K ~ . Indeed , this latter observation will permit us to characterize several instances of ( QP ) where ( 1 ) is solvable in polynomial time . 2 . The polytopes QP " and QP [ p Since we are dealing with the Boolean quadratic form ( 2 ) , we denote the convex hull of solutions to ( 4 ) , . . . , ( 8 ) , QP " = conv { ( x , y ) c R " ~ " + 1 ) / 2 ] ( x , y ) satisfies ( 4 ) , . . . , ( 8 ) } ( 9 ) the Boolean quadrie polytope and QP [ p = { ( x , y ) ~ Rn ~ " + ' ~ / 21 ( x , y ) satisfies ( 4 ) , . . . , ( 7 ) } ( 10 ) the linear relaxation of QPn . We simply write ( x , y ) rather than ( x , y ) T for notational convenience and we assume throughout the paper that n > ~ 2 . Proposition 1 . If ( x , y ) ~ QP [ p , then 0 < ~ x ~ < ~ 1 and y ~ < ~ 1 for all 1 < ~ i < j < ~ n . Proof . Trivial . It follows that Qpn and QP [ p are bounded polyhedra , i . e . they are " polytopes " as designated by their definitions and clearly , Qpn has exactly 2 n vertices while QP [ p has in general many more vertices . Proposition 2 . Qpn and QPLP are full - dimensional , i . e . dim QP " = dimQP [ p = n ( n + l ) / 2 . Proof . Trivial . It follows that each facet - defining inequality is unique up to multiplication by a positive scalar . We denote by ui the n - vector having all components zero except the i - th one which equals 1 , and by v ~ the n ( n - 1 ) / 2 - vector having all components zero except the ( i , j ) - th one which equals 1 ; we assume the natural order 12 , 13 , . . . , 1 n , 23 , . . . for the indexing of the vectors v and y . Furthermore , positions ( i , j ) and ( L i ) are considered identical under this indexing . 142 Proposition 3 . j < ~ n . M . Padberg / The Boolean quadric polytope The inequalities Yo > ~ 0 define facets of QP " and QP ~ p for all 1 < ~ i < Proof . Let F = { ( x , y ) c Qpn lY ~ = 0 } . Suppose there exists an inequality b ( x , y ) < ~ bo valid for QW such that every point ( x , y ) ~ F satisfies b ( x , y ) = bo . ( i ) Since 0 ~ F it follows that b0 = 0 . ( ii ) Since ( ui , O ) c F it follows that bg = 0 for i = 1 , . . . , n . ( iii ) Since ( Ug + Uk , Vik ) eF for k ~ j , it follows that bik = O for all l < ~ j < k < ~ n , k¢j ; similarly , bkg = 0 for all l < ~ k < i < ~ n ; bjk = O for all l < ~ j < k < ~ n ; bkj = O for all l < - k < j < ~ n , k # i . ( iv ) Since ( Uh + Uk , Vhk ) C F for h ~ i and k # j it follows that bhk = 0 for h = 1 , . . . , n , k = l , . . . , n , h # i , k¢j . Hence , b ( x , y ) < ~ bo becomes bjgj < ~ O . Now , since ( ui + Ui , v ~ ) satifies b ( x , y ) < ~ bo we have bq ~ < 0 and hence ba < 0 . The proposition follows . Proposition 4 . The inequalities Y ~ i < ~ xg and y ~ j < ~ xj define facets of QP " and QP ~ p for all l < ~ i < j < ~ n . ( ii ) ( iii ) ( iv ) h¢i . ( v ) Proof . Let F = { ( x , y ) c QP " [ Y0 = x ~ } . Suppose there exists an inequality b ( x , y ) < ~ bo valid for QP " such that every point ( x , y ) c F satisfies b ( x , y ) = bo . ( i ) Since 0 c F it follows that b0 = 0 . Since ( uk , 0 ) ~ F for k ~ i it follows that bk = 0 for k = 1 , . . . , n , k ~ i . Since ( ug + uj , vgj ) ~ F it follows that bg + b ( i = 0 , that is bgj = - bg . Since ( uh + uk , Vhk ) E F for h ~ i it follows that bhk = 0 for all 1 ~ < h < k ~ < n , Since ( u ~ + uj + uk , v ~ j + vik + Vjk ) C F it follows that bg - bz + bik = O , that is bik = 0 for all 1 < ~ i < k ~ < n , k ~ j ; similarly , bkg - 0 for all 1 < ~ k < i ~ < n . Hence , b ( x , y ) < ~ bo becomes bgxi - biYik < ~ O . Now , bi ~ 0 since there exists an ( x , y ) c Qpn such that b ( x , y ) < O . It follows that y ~ j < ~ xi define facets of Qpn and QP ~ p . Similarly , one shows that y ~ < ~ x ; define facets of QP " and QP ~ p . Proposition 5 . The inequalities xg + xj - y ~ j < ~ 1 define facets of QP " and QP [ p for all l < ~ i < j < ~ n . Proof . Let F = { ( x , y ) ~ QP " Ix ~ + xj - y ~ j = 1 } . Suppose there exists an inequality b ( x , y ) < ~ bo valid for QP " such that every point ( x , y ) c F satisfies b ( x , y ) = bo . ( i ) Since ( ui , O ) c F it follows that b ~ = bo ; similarly , bj = bo . ( ii ) Since ( Ug + uj , vo ) c F it follows that bq = - bo . ( iii ) Since ( ug + Uk , Vik ) C F for k ~ j it follows that bo + bk + bgk = O , that is bik - ~ - bk for all l < ~ i < k < ~ n , k ~ j ; similarly , bkg = - - bk for all l < ~ k < i < ~ n ; bjk = - - bk for all l < ~ j < k < ~ n ; bkj = - bk for all l < ~ k < j < ~ n , k ¢ i . ( iv ) Since ( ui + uj + Uk , V ~ + Vgk + Vjk ) ~ F it follows that bo + bo + bk - - bo - bk - - bk = b0 , that is bk = 0 for k = 1 , . . . , n , kS i , k ~ j . M . Padberg / The Boolean quadric polytope 143 ( v ) Since ( ui + uj + Uh + Uk , Vii + V ~ h + V ~ k + Vjh + Vjk + Vhk ) C F it follows that bo + bo - bo + bhk = bo , that is bhk = 0 for all 1 < ~ h < k ~ < n , h ~ i . Hence , b ( x , y ) < ~ bo becomes box ~ + boxj - boyo < ~ bo . Now , bo ~ > 0 since 0 c Qpn , and hence b0 > 0 . We summarize the results concerning the facial structure of QP " and QP [ p obtained in this section in the following : Theorem 1 . ( i ) dimQP " = dim QP [ p = n ( n + 1 ) / 2 . ( ii ) The inequalities ( 4 ) , . . . , ( 7 ) define all facets of QP [ p . ( iii ) The inequalities ( 4 ) , . . . , ( 7 ) define " trivial " facets of QP ' . For n 2 , we have Qp2 = 2 3 = QPLP . The polytope QPLP , however , has exactly the following four additional " fractional " vertices : PI : xl = - x2 = x3 = 1 , Yij = 0 , l ~ < i < J < ~ 3 , e2 : x1 ~ - - x2 ~ x3 = 1 Y12 ~ - Y13 = 1 Y23 = 0 , P3 : Xl = X2 = X3 = 1 , Y12 = Y23 = 1 , Ya3 = 0 , P4 : x1 = x2 = x3 = 1 , Y13 = Y23 = 1 , Y12 = 0 . Thus additional facets are needed to cut off these vertices of Qp3p : P1 is cut off by the inequality x14 - Xz - t - x3 - Y12 - Y13 - Y23 ~ 1 , ( 11 ) and P2 , P3 and P4 are cut off by the following inequalities : - - X 1 4 - Y12 - ' } - Yl3 - Y23 ~ ' ~ 0 , ( 12 ) - x2 + Yl2 - Y13 + Y23 < ~ O , ( 13 ) - x3 - yx2 + y13 + y23 < ~ O , ( 14 ) that show a certain common " structure " . We will call inequalities ( 11 ) , . . . , ( 14 ) the triangle inequalities . All of ( 11 ) , . . . , ( 14 ) define facets of Qp3 and , moreover , Qp3 = Qp3p c ~ { ( x , y ) c R ' ( ' + ' ~ / 21 ( x , y ) satisfies ( I 1 ) , . . . , ( 14 ) } . However , for n ~ > 4 the structure ofQP " is far more complicated . Before investigating further facets of QP " and the vertices of QP [ p we give two additional characteristics of QP " and QP [ p . For any polytope P , we call the collection of its vertices ( 0 - faces ) and its edges ( 1 - faces ) the 1 - skeleton of P . Let Q be a polytope that is contained in P . We say that P has the Trubin - property ( with respect to Q ) if the l - skeleton of Q is a subset of the 1 - skeleton of P , see Trubin ( 1969 ) , Balas and Padberg ( 1972 and 1976 ) , and also Girlich and Kowaljow ( 1981 ) and Yemelichev , Kovalev and Kraftsov ( 1985 ) who call a polytope P with this property " quasi - integral " . If P has the Trubin - property , then all vertices of Q are vertices of P and those facets of Q that define 144 M . Padberg / The Boolean quadric polytope invalid inequalities for P do not create any new " adjacencies " among the vertices of Q . It is far from true that Q c p implies the Trubin - property . Given two vertices z ~ , z 2 of a polytope Q denote d ( z ~ , z 2 ) the minimum number of edges of Q in a " path " on Q connecting z ~ and z 2 . The diameter of Q is the maximum d ( z 1 , z 2 ) over all pairs of vertices of Q . Let S _ _ _ V and define z s = ( x s , yS ) c QW by { ; ifjcS , { ~ ife ~ E ( S ) , xS = otherwise , yS = otherwise , where E ( S ) = { e c E [ e has both end points in S } . ( 15 ) ( iii ) we - w ~ = 0 , ( iv ) we - w ~ = 0 , ( v ) w ~ - wi = 0 , ( vi ) w ~ = 0 , w ~ - wj = 0 , we - wj = O , W e - - W i - - Wj : O , We - - Wi - - 14 ] j ~ - O , we - wj = O , we - wi - wj = O , we - w ~ - wj = O , Ve = ( i , j ) c E ( S - T ) , Ve = ( i , j ) e E ( Sc ~ T ) ) , Ve = ( i , j ) ~ ( S - T : Sn T ) , Ve = ( i , j ) cE ( T - S ) , Ve = ( i , j ) c ( T - S : Tc ~ S ) , Ve = ( i , j ) c ( S - T : T - S ) . ( i ) we - wi = 0 , ( ii ) we - wi = 0 , Furthermore , for T c V - S we denote ( S : T ) = { ( i , j ) e E [ icS , je T } . ( 16 ) Theorem 2 . ( i ) The diameter of Qpn equals 1 . ( ii ) QP ~ p has the Trubin - property with respect to Qpn . Z T Proof . To prove ( i ) and ( ii ) we show that any two vertices z s , c QP " with S # T are adjacent vertices on QP ~ e , i . e . that they are connected by an edge of QP ~ p . More precisely , we show that ½ ( zS + zr ) + wcQP ~ e implies w = A ( zS - z r ) forsomeacR for any w c R " ~ " + 1 ) / 2 . Since ~ ( z s + z T ) ± w ~ QP [ p , ( 4 ) , . . . , ( 7 ) are satisfied and we have wi = 0 ViE V - Su T , We = O VecE ( V - SuT ) u ( SuT : V - S ~ T ) . Furthermore , we obtain the following equations : M . Padberg / The Boolean quadric polytope 145 By transitivity , it follows that w ~ = w ~ = wj = A , Ve = ( i , j ) ~ E ( S - T ) , w ~ = w ~ = wj = O , Ve = ( i , j ) eE ( Sc ~ T ) , w ~ = h , Vee ( S - T : Sc ~ T ) , w ~ = w ~ = wj = 7 , Ve = ( i , j ) ~ E ( T - S ) , w ~ = y , Vec ( T - S : Sc ~ T ) , A + y = 0 , Vet ( S - T : T - S ) , and thus w = A ( zS - z r ) for some A eR . Consequently , all vertices of QP " are mutually adjacent on QP [ p and hence , they are mutually adjacent on QP ' . The theorem follows . 3 . Three families of facets of QP " In this section we introduce three families of facet - inducing inequalities for Qpn . The first one generalizes the triangle inequality ( 11 ) , the second one generalizes the inequalities ( 12 ) , ( 13 ) , ( 14 ) ; the third one is obtained by a " symmetry " argument . Like in Section 2 we write z = ( x , y ) and a ~ for a component of aeR ~ + 1 ) / 2 corresponding to i e V , ae or a o for a component of a corresponding to e = ( i , j ) e E . For any valid inequality az < ~ ao of Qpn we denote G ( a ) = ( V ( a ) , E ( a ) ) its support graph where E ( a ) = { e e E ] a ~ ¢ 0 } and V ( a ) is the subset of nodes of V spanned by E ( a ) . Furthermore , Sc V ( a ) is a disconnecting set ( or articulation set ) if the graph obtained from G ( a ) by removing S and all edges in E ( S ) u ( S : V ( a ) - S ) has one more connected component than G ( a ) . The following lemma states some elementary properties of the support graph of facet - defining inequalities of QPn . Lemma 1 . If az < ~ ao defines a facet of QP ~ , then : ( i ) ae¢ 0 for at least one e ~ E . ( ii ) az < ~ ao is an inequality of the form ( 4 ) , . . . , ( 7 ) if IV ( a ) [ < ~ 2 . ( iii ) G ( a ) is connected . ( iv ) G ( a ) is 2 - connected if ] V ( a ) l ~ > 3 . ( v ) no ( u , v ) e E ( a ) defines a disconnecting set of G ( a ) if IV ( a ) [ ~ > 3 . Proof . ( i ) Suppose not . Then az = bx where b e R " . Since max { bxl ( x , y ) e QP ' } = ~ v max { 0 , bi } , it follows that ao / > ~ i ~ v max { 0 , bi } . Hence az < ~ ao is implied by a linear combination of the constraints - xi ~ < 0 and x ~ ~ < 1 for i e V . By Proposition 1 , these inequalities are implied by ( 4 ) , . . . , ( 7 ) and hence so is az < ~ ao . ( ii ) ] V ( a ) l = l is impossible by ( i ) . So let IV ( a ) l = 2 and az = aix ~ + ajxj + aoy U . Since az < ~ ao is different from ( 4 ) it follows that ao = 0 , since it is different from ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) we have a ~ = aj = 0 and since it is different from ( 7 ) a ~ = 0 , which is a contradiction . 146 M . Padberg / The Boolean quadric polytope ( iii ) Suppose the contrary , let G1 = ( V1 , El ) be a connected component of G ( a ) and G2 - - ( V ( a ) - V1 , E ( a ) - EO . Define a ~ = ai Vic V1 , a ~ = 0 (cid:127)ic V - V1 , al . = ae VecE , al ~ = 0 VecE - E1 , and a2 = a - a 1 . Let a ~ = max { a / z I z c QP ' } and z i ~ QP " be such that aiz ~ = a ~ o for i = 1 , 2 . Since G 1 and G 2 are disjoint partial subgraphs of G ( a ) it follows that z 1 and z 2 can be chosen such that za + z2c QW . It follows that a01 + ao2 < ~ ao . On the other hand , let z c QP " be such that az = ao . By construction , ao ~ < a ~ + ao 2 and thus ao = a ~ + a ~ . Consequently , every z ~ QP " satisfy - . i ing az = ao satisfies a ' z = ao for i = 1 , 2 , which is a contradiction . ( iv ) Suppose that G ( a ) has a cutnode u , i . e a node whose removal disconnects G ( a ) . Let ( Vk , Ek ) for k = 1 , 2 be the two resulting subgraphs of G ( a ) where Vl ( - ) V2 = bl . By part ( ii ) we have [ V ( a ) [ ~ > 3 and thus Vie { u } # V2 and E1¢0 # E 2 . Let aoka = max / Y . aixi + ~ aeYeI ( X , Y ) ~ QW , x ~ = 6 } k i ~ Vh - - u e ~ E k and let z k ~ be a corresponding maximizing vertex of Qpn where k = 1 or 2 and 6 = 0 or 1 . Define k akoO _ akol ' a / k = 0 VicV - Vk , aki = ai Vie Vk - - U , au = k k ae = ae VecEk , ae = 0 VecE - Ek , where k = 1 or 2 . It follows that akz < ~ ako ° is a valid inequality for QP " . Adding the two inequalities we obtain , 10 - - 20 11 - - a21 a . ) x , , - lo - 20 ( al + a2 ) z = az + ~ ao ±ao - ao - ~ ao ~ - ao . Since az < ~ ao defines a facet of QW there exist points z c QW with az = ao such that x ~ = l and x , = 0 , respectively . Consequently , ao < ~ a ~ o° + a ~ ° and a0 ~ < aollq _ 21 , ao - ~ a , . On the other hand , we can choose z ka such that zl° + z2°eQW and z ~ 1 + z 12 e QP " , where in the latter case we set the component of the sum correspond - ing to node u equal to 1 . Consequently , m - 20 a ~ l 2 ~ ao ~ - ao < ~ ao and + ao + au < ~ ao . It follows that az = ao if and only if alz = a ~ ° and a2z = a 2° , which is a contradiction . ( v ) Suppose that f = ( u , v ) c E ( a ) is a disconnecting set of G ( a ) , i . e . V ( a ) = V1 V2 with V1 c ~ V2 = { u , v } ; E ( a ) = E1 w E2 where E ~ = E ( V ~ ) for i = 1 , 2 and E1 n E2 = f ; and Vl - { U , v } ¢0 # V2 - { u , v } . We define ao = max F . aixi + Y ~ a ~ ye [ ( X , y ) ~ QP n , x ~ = 6 , x ~ = A Vk - - { u , v } Ek - - f M . Padberg / The Boolean quadrie polytope 147 where Gk = ( Vk , Ek ) , k c { 1 , 2 } and ~ , h c { 0 , 1 } and let z TM c QP " be a corresponding maximizer . Define a k as follows : a ~ = ai Vie Vk - - { U , V } , ak = 0 Vi ~ V - Vk , a k = ae Ve c Ek - - f , k kO0 klO k kO0 k01 au = ao - ao , av = ao - ao , a ~ = 0 VecE - Ek , k klO - - kO1 kO0 kll af ~ a 0 ~ - a 0 - - a 0 - - a 0 . It follows that akg < ~ a k°° are valid inequalities for QPn and that ( al + a2 ) z = az + ( a ~ °° + ao2°° - ao11° _ a ~ lO au ) xu , loo _ 200 a ol a Ol + tao ±ao - - a ~ ) x ~ ~ 110 - 101 - 2 , 0 - 20 , 100 al , ~ _ a200 a ~ 11 af ) yf + tao tao ±ao tao - ao - - - 100 - - 200 a o t a o . Using the maximizers z TM and modifying them as necessary we get 1oo - 200 _ ao ~ Ol + 2Ol - ao ±ao ~ ao , ao - t - av < ~ ao , 111 - - ao211 + alol° + a ~ l° + a , , < ~ ao , ao - 1 - a , , + a ~ + ar < ~ ao . On the other hand , since az < ~ ao is different from ( 4 ) , . . . , ( 7 ) , there exist z c QP ~ such that az = ao and x , = x ~ = ys = O ; xu = l , x , = ys = O ; x ~ = yf = O , x ~ = l and x ~ , = x ~ = yf = 1 , respectively , since any subset of three or less implies that az < - ao is one of the facets ( 4 ) . . . . , ( 7 ) . It follows that 1 O0 - - 200 ( al + a2 ) z = az < ~ ao ±ao = ao and thus that az = ao if and only if akz = a k°° for k = 1 and 2 , which is a contradiction . The lemma follows . It would be interesting to know if Lemma 1 , part ( v ) , can be generalized to disconnecting complete subgraphs of G ( a ) of cardinality greater than two . Let a ( x , y ) < ~ ao be a valid inequality for Qpn . Its canonical extension a * ( x , y ) < ~ ao to QpN for N > n is given by a * = ai Vic V , a * = 0 Vi ~ VI - V , a * ~ = a ~ Ve6E ( V ) , a ~ * = O Ve ~ E ( VI - V ) u ( V : V1 - V ) , where V = { 1 . . . . , n } and V 1 = { 1 , . . . , N } . Note that we use the same ( generic ) symbol to denote vectors in QP " and QpN . Likewise , let b ( x , y ) < ~ bo be a valid inequality for QpN . Its canonical restriction b ( x , y ) < ~ bo to Qpn is obtained by discarding from b all components bi with i c V 1 - V and all components be with e c E ( V 1 - V ) w ( V : V 1 - V ) . Clearly , the canonical restriction of a point ( x , y ) 6 Qpu 148 M . Padberg / The Boolean quadrie polytope ( defined correspondingly ) yields a point ( x , y ) ~ QP " . To every point ( x , y ) c QW there correspond exactly 2 ~ - ~ points ( x , y ) ~ QpN that are obtained as follows : X i : X i V i c V , xi6 { 0 , 1 } Vi ~ V1 - V , Ye = Ye Ve ~ E ( V ) , ye = X ~ Xj Ve = ( i , j ) 6E ( V1 - V ) ~ ( V : V ' - V ) . It follows that the canonical extension of a valid inequality for QP " is valid for Qpu and that the canonical restriction of a valid inequality for Q p N is valid for QW . Theorem 3 ( Lifting Theorem ) . If a ( x , y ) < - ao defines a facet of QW then its canonical extension a * ( x , y ) < ~ ao defines a facet of QpN for all N > n . Proof . By the remarks above a * ( x , y ) ~ < ao is a valid inequality for QpN for all N > n . We prove the assertion for N = n + 1 and then use induction . Let ( x i , y ~ ) , 1 ~ < i ~ < k , be any k points of QW satisfying a ( x , y ) = a ~ x + a2y = ao . With every point ( x ~ , y ~ ) we associate two points in Qp ~ + l as above , namely ( £i , fi ) and ( 2 ~ , fz ) where £ ~ - ( x ~ , 0 ) , ~ = ( x ~ , 1 ) , y = ( yi , 0 ) , and ) ~ a = ( yi , x ~ ) . The 2k new points satisfy a * ( x , y ) = ao . Suppose there exists a hyperplane b ( x , y ) = bo different from a * ( x , y ) = a0 passing through the 2k points . Let where b ( x , y ) = blx + b2y = bo b I = ( ~ 1 , b ~ + , ) c R n + l , [ ) lc R n , b 2 = ( / ~ 2 , / ~ 2 ) ~ R , ~ n + l ) / 2 , ~ 2 ~ Rn ~ n - l ~ / 2 , i . e . / ~ = ( / ~ 1 , / ~ 2 ) is the canonical restriction of b to Qpn and defines a valid inequality for QW . Since ( yi , y ) , i = 1 , . . . , k , satisfy both a ( x , y ) = ao and / ~ ( x , y ) = bo , it follows that / ~ 1 = Aa 1 , / ~ 2 = Aa 2 and bo = Aao for some A / > 0 , since a ( x , y ) < ~ ao defines a facet of QP ' . Furthermore , since ( ~ , y ) for i = 1 , . . . , k satisfy b ( x , y ) = bo , it follows that ha lxi ~ - b ln + l + Aa 2y i + [ ) 2xi = hao . But halx ~ + ha2y i = Aao and hence , bln + l = - / ~ 2xg . Since a ( x , y ) < ~ ao defines a facet of QW , it follows from the full - dimensionality of QW that bl , + ~ = I ~ ao , ~ 2 = _ l ~ a 1 and 0 = / ~ a 2 for some / z . Now , if / ~ ~ 0 it follows that a 2 = 0 and thus , by Lemma 1 part ( i ) , a ( x , y ) < ~ ao does not define a facet of QP " , which is a contradiction . Thus , / ~ = 0 , b ~ n + l = 0 , / ~ 2 = 0 , and ( b , b0 ) = h ( a * , ao ) with A ~ > 0 . The theorem follows . For any S _ ~ V , we define x ( S ) = (cid:127) xv and y ( E ( S ) ) = Z v ~ S e ~ E ( S ) Ye " M . Padberg / The Boolean quadric polytope 149 Lemma 2 . For any S c V with IS ] > ~ 2 and integer a , 1 < - oz < - IS ] - 1 , the clique - inequality az : = ozx ( S ) - y ( E ( S ) ) < ~ oz ( oz + l ) 2 ( 17 ) is valid for QW . Proof . Let R ~ V , k = IS ~ R ] and set f ( k ) = az R - a ( a + 1 ) / 2 . It follows that f ( k ) = - ( oz - k ) ( a + 1 - k ) / 2 and thusf ( k ) ~ < 0 for all 0 < ~ k < ~ oz + 1 < ~ Isl . The lemma follows . Note that for oz = 1 and IS I = 3 the clique - inequalities ( 17 ) are precisely the triangle inequalities ( 11 ) . Theorem 4 . For any Sc _ V with 1s [ ~ 3 and integer a , l ~ < oz ~ < lS [ - 2 , the clique - inequality ( 17 ) defines a facet of QP ' . The number of distinct facets of QP " defined this way equals ( n - 4 ) 2 " - 1 + n + 2 . Proof . We prove the assertion for S = V and then use the Lifting Theorem . Let F = { ( x , y ) ~ QP " [ ozx ( V ) - y ( E ) = oz ( a + 1 ) / 2 } , and let R be any subset of V of size oz or oz + 1 . Then from the proof of Lemma 2 it follows that ( x n , yR ) ~ F . Let b ( x , y ) < ~ bo be any inequality valid for QW such that ( x , y ) c F implies b ( x , y ) = bo . Denote Fb = { ( x , y ) ~ Qpn I b ( x , y ) = b0 } the face of QP " defined by this inequality . Let i e V and R _ ~ V - i with ] R I = oz . Then the points ( x R , yR ) and ( x R + ~ , yR + ~ ) belong to F ~ F6 . Hence , differencing yields bi q - ~ bik = O . k ~ R Similarly , let R 1 = R - j q - h , where h e V - R and j c R , which is a subset of V of size oz . By the same argument , we obtain bi + ~ bik = O , k ~ R I and hence , b 0 = b ~ h for allj ~ h . By transitivity , bo = / x for all i Cj . Therefore bi = - a / z for all i ~ V . Since ( x R + ~ , yR + , ) e F ~ Fb , it follows that a ( a + l ) ( a + 1 ) ( - tzoz ) 4 - - tz = bo , 2 and hence , / x = - 2bo / a ( a + 1 ) . Therefore , b ( x , y ) < ~ bo reads bo ( ax ( V ) - y ( E ) ) a ( a + 1 ) bo / 2 . Now , since 0 c QW , it follows that bo 1 > 0 and hence bo > 0 . Hence , for S = V the inequalities ( 17 ) define facets of Qpn . Consider now a subset S of V . We know that the inequalities ( 17 ) define facets of Qpn for n = IS [ . By the Lifting Theorem it follows that they define facets of QpN for all N ~ > n . Clearly , no two distinct clique - inequalities are identical . Since Qpn is full - dimensional , they define distinct facets of Qpn and the rest of the theorem follows by a counting argument . 150 M . Padberg / The Boolean quadric polytope Lemma 3 . For any S ~ V with ] SI > ~ 1 and T c _ V - S with [ TI ~ > 2 the cut - inequality az : = - x ( S ) - y ( E ( S ) ) + y ( S : T ) - y ( E ( T ) ) < ~ 0 ( 18 ) is valid for QP ' . Proof . Let R be any subset of V and let zR = ( xR , yR ) C QW . Set lR c ~ S I = r , lR c ~ T [ = k , s - ISl , t = I r [ , and f ( k , r ) = az R . It follows that f ( k , r ) = - ½ ( k - r ) ( k - r - 1 ) ~ < 0 for all 0 ~ < k ~ t and 0 ~ < r ~ < s , since ( k - r ) ( k - r - 1 ) < 0 is impossible for integer values of k and r . The lemma follows . Note that for ISI = l and Irl = 2 the inequalities ( 18 ) are precisely the triangle inequalities ( 12 ) , ( 13 ) , ( 14 ) . Theorem 5 . For any S c V with IS ] > ~ 1 and T c V - S with I TI > ~ 2 the cut - inequality ( 18 ) defines a facet of QP " . The number of distinct facets of QP " defined this way equals 3 " - ( n + 4 ) 2 " l + n + l . Proof . Let F = { ( x , y ) 6 QP " I - x ( S ) - y ( E ( S ) ) + y ( S : T ) - y ( E ( T ) ) = 0 } . Suppose there exists an inequality b ( x , y ) < ~ bo valid for QP " such that every point ( x , y ) c F satisfies b ( x , y ) = bo . ( i ) Since 0 c F it follows that bo = 0 . ( ii ) Since ( uj , O ) cF for allj ~ S , it follows that bj = O for allj ~ S . ( iii ) Since ( Uj + Uk , Vjk ) CF for allj ~ T , k ~ Su T , it follows that bjk = O for all jc T , kf ! Su T . ( iv ) Since ( Uk + Uh , Vkh ) ~ F for all k , hc : Su T , it follows that bkh = O for all k , h ~ SuT . ( v ) Since ( ui + uj , vo ) c F for all i ~ S , j c T , it follows that bij = - bi for all i c S , jeT . ( vi ) Since ( ui + uj + Uk , V ~ + V ~ k + Vjk ) C F for all i ~ S , j c T , k ~ S u T , it follows that bik = 0 for all i ~ S , k ~ S u T . ( vii ) Since ( U ~ + Uj + Uk , VO + Vik + Vjk ) CF for all i ~ S , j , k ~ T , it follows that bjk = bi for all i c S , j , k c T . Hence , bh = b ~ for all i , h ~ S , i ~ h . ( viii ) Since ( Ui + Uh + Uj + Uk , Vih + Vo + Vik + Vhj + Vhk + Vjk ) ~ F for all i , hcS , j , k c T , it follows that b ~ h = b ~ for all i , h c S . Hence , b ( x , y ) = bo reads bi ( x ( S ) + y ( E ( S ) ) - y ( S : T ) + y ( E ( T ) ) ) < ~ O . Now , since ( u ~ , 0 ) ~ QP ' , it follows that b ~ ~ 0 , and hence b ~ < 0 . Clearly , no two distinct cut - inequalities are identical . Since Qpn is full - dimensional , they define distinct facets of QP " and the rest of the theorem follows by a counting argument . The following theorem shows that the " vertex - figures " for any pair z R , z s of vertices of Qpn are identical modulo a transformation , where R , S _ c V and by " vertex - figure " of a vertex z R ~ QP " we mean the cone that is formed by all facets of QP " that contain z R . M . Padberg / The Boolean quadric polytope 151 Theorem 6 ( Symmetry Theorem ) . For any R , S ~ _ V and any facet az < ~ ao of QP ~ such that az R - ~ a 0 there exists a unique facet dz < ~ d o of Qpn such that dz s = d o . Proof . For any M _ V consider the mapping ~ bM given by 1 - xi VieM , ~ bM ( X , ) = x , Vie V - M , [ - - ye + Xj Ve = ( i , j ) ~ ( M : V - M ) , 4JM ( ye ) = l ; / ye - - Xi - - X j Ve = ( i , j ) eE ( M ) , Ve = ( i , j ) ~ E ( V - M ) . ~ bM is one - to - one and maps R n ( ~ + 1 ) / 2 onto itself . For M = fl the mapping ~ M is the identity . One verifies that for any R _ ~ V we have ~ M ( Z R ) = Z RaM , where RAM = ( R - M ) (cid:127) ( M - R ) is the symmetric difference of R and M , and furthermore that 4 , M ( QPn ) = QW . Moreover , using the inverse mapping one verifies that a facet - defining inequality az < ~ ao for QW is mapped into the facet - defining inequality dz ~ < do where ~ - ai - a ( i : M - i ) VieM , di = ( ai + a ( i : M ) Vie V - M , a e VeeE ( M ) uE ( V - M ) , ( 19 ) ae = - ae Vet ( M : V - M ) , do = ao - a ( M ) - a ( E ( M ) ) . To prove the theorem one applies the mapping ~ M with M - - RAS that maps z R into z s since R / I ( RAS ) ~ - S . Applying the Symmetry Theorem with M = V to the clique - inequalities we find that this family of facets is mapped onto itself . However , for the cut - inequalities this is not the case and we have Corollary 1 . For any S ~ _ V with s = IS [ > ~ 1 and T ~ _ V - S with t = iT [ > ~ 2 the general - ized cut - inequality ( s - t ) x ( S ) + ( t - s - 1 ) x ( T ) - y ( E ( S ) ) + y ( S : T ) - y ( E ( T ) ) < ~ ½ ( t - s ) ( t - s - 1 ) ( 20 ) defines a facet of Qpn . For t = s or t = s + 1 the generalized cut - inequality ( 20 ) is a cut - inequality ( 18 ) . The rest define facets of QW that are distinct from the facets defined by the clique 152 M . Padberg / The Boolean quadric polytope and cut - inequalities . Indeed , using the mapping 4 ' M of the Symmetry Theorem for arbitrary M _ ~ S w T one can construct " more complex " facets of Qpn starting from the facets described thus far . We thus know that at least 0 ( 3 n ) linear inequalities are needed to describe the Boolean quadric polytope . 4 . The vertices of QP [ p In this section we show that all vertices of QP [ p are { 0 , ½ , 1 } - valued , we give a valid inequality that cuts off fractional vertices of QP ~ p and show that the inequalities ( 11 ) , . . . , ( 14 ) suffice to cut off all fractional vertices of QP [ p . Denoting L the constraint matrix given by ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) we can write L as follows : where A is the edge - node incidence matrix of Kn , I is the identity matrix of size m = n ( n - 1 ) / 2 . F and G are matrices of size m x n having exactly one - 1 entry per row . We denote compatibly dimensioned zero - matrices by O . Lemma 4 . Every nonsingular submatrix B of L has a determinant of ±2 p where p is a non - negative integer . Proof . Let B be any nonsingular submatrix of L of size k x k having a determinant different from + 1 . We can assume without restriction of generality that every row and column of B contains at least two non - zero entries . Suppose that B contains a row having three non - zero entries . It follows that B contains the configuration : 0 . . . 0 1 1 - 1 0 . . . 0 0 . . . 0 0 - 1 1 0 . . . 0 By an elementary row operation we get a unit row . Since such an operation does not alter the absolute value of the determinant we can delete the row and the appropriate column , delete any other unit rows or columns , and repeat the argument if necessary . It follows that B has a determinant equal to ±1 ( if the preceding operations render the matrix empty ) or that it contains a nonsingular submatrix having exactly two non - zero entries per row and at least two non - zeroes per column whose determinant equals the determinant of B in absolute value . We denote this submatrix again by B and counting its non - zeroes , it follows that every row and every column of B has exactly two non - zero entries . Denote G ( B ) the bipartite graph ( I / ' 1 , V2 , F ) defined as follows : Every row of B defines a node of V1 , every column of B defines a node of V2 . Node i c V1 is joined to node j ~ V2 if the element bq of B is non - zero and the edge ( i , j ) c F gets the weight bq . Since every node of M . Padberg / The Boolean quadric polytope 153 G ( B ) has degree two and I Vll - - Iw2h it follows that G ( B ) is a collection of disjoint ( simple ) cycles and hence B decomposes correspondingly as B = " . . ( 21 ) where Bi corresponds to the i - th cycle of G ( B ) and p / > 1 is some integer . Since B is Eulerian and nonsingular , it follows that every Bi is nonsingular and Eulerian . Consequently ( see e . g . Example 6 in Padberg ( 1984 ) ) every B ~ has a determinant of ~ 2 and the lemma follows . Remark 1 . A theorem by Camion ( used implicitly in the proof of Lemma 4 ) permits one to characterize the " kernels " of fractionalities of QP ~ p as follows : Consider any Bi in the decomposition ( 21 ) and call it again B . Using the " structure " of L it follows that B can be partitioned as follows : ( 10 0 / B = B22 B23 ( 22 ) \ B31 0 B33 / where Bll is of size r I × k I and contains exactly two + 1 entries per row , B22 is of size r2 × k2 and contains exactly two - 1 entries per column , Be3 is of size r 2 × k 3 and contains exactly one + 1 per row , B31 is of size r 3 × k 1 and contains exactly one - 1 entry per row , B33 is of size r3 × k3 and contains exactly one + 1 entry per row , and 0 are zero - matrices . BH is non - empty with kl ~ > 2 , while the others submatrices may be empty . By Camion ' s theorem ( 1965 ) , see e . g . Padberg ( 1984 , Theorem 15 ) , the sum of the entries of B is not divisible by four and hence , it follows that rl ~ > 1 is odd . In the complete graph K , associated with ( QP ) we have thus the configurations shown in Figure 1 and in terms of the constraint matrix L the submatrices shown in Figure 2 that give rise to the nonsingular submatrices of L with a determinant o 1 5e o2 lo 3 1 4o o3 2o 4 3 ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) Fig . 1 .

Figure l ( b ) shows an ( odd or even ) cycle having an odd number of edges " missing " and Figure 2 ( b ) the corresponding submatrix . Likewise , part ( c ) of the two figures shows the third possibility . In Figure 2 ( a ) we have B = BI ~ in terms of the partitioning ( 22 ) , in 2 ( b ) B22 and B23 are empty , while 2 ( c ) shows a general case . The " missing " edges of the cycles in Figure 1 correspond to the Bn part of the partitioning ( 22 ) . In summary , every ( odd or even ) simple cycle in Kn having an odd number of edges missing gives rise to a nonsingular submatrix of L having a determinant different from + 1 . Theorem 7 . Every vertex z c QP [ p is { 0 , 1 , 1 } - valued . Proof . Let z be any vertex of QPLP , let N be the set of indices corresponding to the positive components of z and I be the index set of the rows of L that are satisfied at equality by z . Denote L * the submatrix of L having its columns in N and its rows in I . Since L * corresponds to a vertex of QP ~ p , L * has full column rank . If L * contain a unit column , then we drop both the column and its corresponding row from L * and continue to do so until L * has no more such columns . This process is clearly correct if the corresponding row is an equation of the form - xi + Yi = O . If the equation is of the form xi + xj - y ~ = 1 and the unit column corresponds to xi , then L * contains the row - xj + y ~ = 0 since L * has full column rank . Consequently , xg = 1 and the process is correct . If the unit column corresponds to y(cid:127) , then the values of x ~ and Xi uniquely determine the value of y ~ and the process is justified as well . We call the matrix that results again L * . If it is empty , then z is { 0 , 1 } - valued . Otherwise , every column of L * has at least two non - zeroes and suppose that L * contains a unit row . The corresponding variable x ~ has value + 1 and its elimination changes a row of L * of the form x ~ + xj - yo = 1 into a row of the form xi - yij = 0 which is ( up to its sign ) a duplicate row that can be dropped from L * . The elimination changes a row of the form - - Xi + Yik = 0 M . Padberg / The Boolean quadric polytope 155 to a row of the form Y ~ k = 1 . By feasibility of z and construction of L * it follows that L * contains a row corresponding to the equation - - Xk + Y ~ k = 0 . We replace this equation by the equation Xk - - - - 1 and drop the column corresponding to Yik and all rows containing Y ~ k . The resulting ( smaller ) matrix L * and its associated equation system are of exactly the same form as the original equation system and thus we can repeat the above argument . If after finitely many steps the resulting matrix is empty , then the vertex z is { 0 , 1 } - valued . Otherwise , we either repeat the whole process or the resulting matrix L * has at least two non - zero entries in each column and each row . We now proceed as in the proof of Lemma 4 . The observations concerning the elimination of variables remain correct for the operations performed in the first part of the proof of Lemma 4 . It follows that z is { 0 , 1 } - valued if these operations render the matrix empty . Else denote L * the resulting p x k matrix . It follows that L * has exactly two nonzeroes per row and that L * has rank k . By feasibility and the previous operations the resulting equation system has a + 1 entry on the left - hand side of an equation having two + 1 entries and a zero entry for an equation having a + 1 and - 1 entry . Consequently , all components of z corresponding to the columns of L * have the value ½ . The other variables in N assume values of 1 or 1 and the theorem follows . Since the defining equation system of a fractional vertex of Qpn contains a nonsingular submatrix of L having a determinant different from ±1 , Lemma 4 and Remark 1 permit one to give a valid inequality for QP " which cuts off those vertices : Let C ~ _ E be any ( simple ) cycle of Kn , ] C [ ~ > 3 , and M _ C be any subset of odd cardinality of C , m = ] M I ~ > 1 . Denote by S the set of nodes of C , So = { ucV [ 3e ~ fcMwith ec ~ f = u } , S2 = { u e V [ 3e C f ~ C - M with e c ~ f = u } , ( 23 ) $ 1 = S - So - $ 2 . Then the odd - cycle - inequality x ( So ) - x ( S2 ) + y ( C - M ) - y ( M ) ~ [ m / 2J ( 24 ) is valid for QP " and cuts off the vertex of QP ~ p given by xi = ½ VieS , ye = 1 VecC - M , ( 25 ) ye = 0 VeE ( E - C ) w M , since Icl - = 21MI - ISol + Is21 . This vertex corresponds to one of the components Bi of ( 21 ) . The definition of ( 24 ) and its validity for Qpn follow by a standard argument from the partitioning ( 22 ) with M being the set of " missing " edges . Inequalities ( 24 ) do , however , not define facets of QP " if IC 1 / > 4 and n / > 4 . 156 M . Padberg / The Boolean quadric polytope Proposition 6 . Every odd - cycle inequality ( 24 ) can be written as a sum of a number of inequalities ( 12 ) , ( 13 ) , ( 14 ) plus exactly [ m / 2J inequalities ( 11 ) . Proof . The assertion of the proposition is true for IcI = 3 . So assume it is true for all cycles of length p ~ > 3 and let C have length p + l . If Is0 [ ~ > 1 , let j ~ So and i , k be the two neighbours of j in C . Define C ~ = C w ( i , k ) - { ( i , j ) , j , k ) } , M 1 : M - { ( i , j ) , ( j , k ) } and So 1 , $ 2 ~ as in ( 23 ) with C and M replaced by C 1 and M 1 . It follows that ( 24 ) is the sum of the two inequalities xi + xj + xk - yo - Yik - Yjk ~ 1 , x ( Slo ) - x ( S ~ ) + y ( C 1 - M ~ ) - y ( M 1 ) ~ < [ ( m - 2 ) / 2J . Since [ C ~ ] = p , the induction hypothesis applies to C 1 and the proposition follows . If Is21 > 1 , letjcS2 and i , k be the two neighbors ofj in C . Define C 1 , S ~ , S ~ as above and M ~ = M . It follows that ( 24 ) is the sum of the two inequalities - xj + y ~ + Yjk - - Yik < ~ 0 , x ( S 1 ) - x ( S ~ ) + y ( C ~ - M 1 ) - y ( M 1 ) < ~ [ m / Z ] , and the proposition follows as before . Finally , assume that both So and $ 2 are empty . Consequently , ] cl > ~ 6 and every edge of C that is in M is followed by an edge in C - M . We index the nodes of C consecutively and such that edge ( 1 , 2 ) is in M . Define C1 = Cw ( 1 , 4 ) - { ( 1 , 2 ) , ( 2 , 3 ) , ( 3 , 4 ) } , MI = M - { ( 1 , 2 ) , ( 3 , 4 ) } and S ~ , S 1 as before . It follows that ( 24 ) is the sum of the three inequalities X l + x2 + x4 - y12 - y14 - y24 ~ < 1 , - - X2 + Y23 + Y24 - - Y34 ~ 0 , x ( S ~ ) - x ( S ~ ) + y ( C ' - M 1 ) - y ( M 1 ) < ~ [ ( m - 2 ) / 2J . Since ] C ~ ] = p - 2 , the induction hypothesis applies to C ~ and the proposition follows in this case as well . Since every fractional vertex of QP ~ p contains at least one " odd " cycle as defined above , Proposition 6 implies in particular that the triangle inequalities ( 11 ) , . . . , ( 14 ) suffice to cut off all fractional vertices of QP ~ p . Since the family of facets ( 17 ) , ( 18 ) and ( 20 ) described in Section 3 is considerably richer than those of ( 11 ) , . . . , ( 14 ) we can expect it to give good results in computational practice , provided that we can algorithmically identify a sufficiently large number of its members . 5 . Problem ( QP ) in sparse graphs In this section we consider the case where G = ( V , E ) is the sparse graph on n nodes that are spanned by the edges e = ( i , j ) given by the nonzero coefficients q ~ j of the quadratic form and / or the coefficients ci of its linear part . We use the same notation as in the previous sections mutatis mutandis . Without loss of generality we assume that G has no isolated nodes . It follows that we need to consider the constraints M . Padberg / The Boolean quadric polytope 157 ( 4 ) , . . . , ( 8 ) for all ( i , j ) c E only . We denote the corresponding convex hull of solutions QpG = conv { ( x , y ) c RV + ~ l ( x , y ) satisfies ( 4 ) , . . . , ( 8 ) for all ( i , j ) c E } the Boolean quadric polytope associated with G and QpLGp = { ( X , y ) ~ RV + ~ l ( x , y ) satisfies ( 4 ) , . . . , ( 7 ) for all ( i , j ) c E } its linear relaxation . For simplicity we write R v + E rather than R Ivl + lEI and denote the associated unconstrained quadratic zero - one problem by ( QPo ) . Problem ( QP ~ ) in a sparse graph can , of course , always be viewed as a problem in the corresponding complete graph by adding all edges not in E to G and assigning them weights of zero . It follows that Qpo and QPLCp can be obtained from QP " and QP [ p , respectively , by " projecting out " the variables Ye with e ~ E . See Balas and Pulleyblank ( 1985 ) for a technique to calculate the corresponding projection . Fur - thermore , since the constraint set of QPLGp is a ( proper ) subset of the constraint set of QP [ p it follows that the extreme point characterization of QP [ p remains correct for o QPLP . The dimension of QpG and QPLCp is I VI + [ E I and Theorem 1 remains true with the necessary minor changes . The diameter of QpG is not necessarily equal to 1 , however , since for z s , zTcQP G with S # T ~ _ V we have 1 S - - 1 T 1 SuT - - 1 Sc ~ T ~ Z ~ - ~ Z : ~ Z ~ c ~ Z if ( S - T : T - S ) : 0 . Thus if G has two connected components or more , then QpG and QpLGp have non adjacent zero - one vertices and the diameter of QpG is at least two . Denote SA T = ( S - T ) u ( T - S ) the symmetric difference of S , T c V and let co ( S ) denote the number of connected components of the subgraph of G induced by So _ V with the convention that co ( 0 ) : 0 . Theorem 8 . ( i ) For S , T c _ V the face F s of minimal dimension of QPLGp containing the vertices z s and z r of QpG has zero - one vertices only and dim F s = co ( S h T ) . ( ii ) QpLGp has the Trubin - property with respect to QpG . Proof . We adapt Trubin ' s argument to our problem in order to prove the theorem . The equation system defining F s is given by - xi + ye = O , - xj + ye = O , Ve = ( i , j ) ~ E ( V - Su T ) u E ( S c ~ T ) o E ( S - T ) u E ( T - S ) , - xi + Ye = 0 Ve : ( i , j ) c ( S - T : S ~ T ) ~ ( T - S : Sc ~ T ) u ( V - Su T : Su T ) , xi + xj - ye = 1 Ve = ( i , j ) c E ( S ~ T ) u ( Sc ~ T : V - S ~ T ) w ( S - T : T - S ) , ye = 0 Ve = ( i , j ) cE ( V - SuT ) w ( SuT : V - SuT ) u ( S - T : T - S ) . 158 M . Padberg / The Boolean quadric polytope In order to prove ( i ) we need to determine the rank r0 of this equation system . Simplifying this system by eliminating unit rows and doing related elementary row operations reduces it to - xi + ye = 0 , - - xj + Ye = O , Ve = ( i , j ) ~ E ( S - T ) uE ( T - S ) , xi + xj = l Ve = ( i , j ) e ( S - T : T - S ) . Furthermore , xi = 1 for all i e S c ~ T , Ye = 1 for all e e E ( S c ~ T ) and all other variables ( except those of the reduced equation system ) assume the value zero . Denote L * the constraint matrix of the reduced equation system and rl the rank of L * . By the previous operations it follows that ro = IVI + IEI - IS A TI - IE ( S - T ) I - IE ( T - S ) I + r , . Define the following graph G ( L * ) = ( V1 , V2 , H ) : To every icS - T and every eeE ( T - S ) there corresponds a node ue V1 and to every ic T - S and every eeE ( S - T ) a node ve ~ . Node ue V1 is joined to node ve V2 by an edge in H if the corresponding columns of L * have a non - zero inner product . It follows that G ( L * ) is bipartite or empty if S = T . Let B be any k x k submatrix of L * having at least two non - zeroes per row and column . It follows that B has exactly two non - zero entries per row and column and that it corresponds to a collection of disjoint ( simple ) cycles in G ( L * ) . Furthermore , B is Eulerian . Since every node u of G ( L * ) that corresponds to e e E ( S - T ) ~ E ( T - S ) is joined to exactly two nodes of G ( L * ) it follows that every simple cycle in G ( L * ) has an even number of edges of G ( L * ) that correspond to edges e c ( S - T : T - S ) . It follows that the sum of all entries of B is divisible by four and hence , by Camion ' s theorem ( 1965 ) , that B is singular and that L * is totally unimodular . Likewise , it follows that the number of connected components of G ( L * ) equals co ( S A T ) and that the rank rl of L * is given by r , = ] S A T [ + IE ( S - T ) I + IE ( T - S ) ] - co ( S A T ) , since every submatrix of L * corresponding to a connected component of G ( L * ) with p nodes has rank p - 1 . Consequently , we have dimF s = ] V I + ] EI - r0 = co ( sAT ) . Because of the linealities in the solution set of the reduced equation system we intersect it with the constraints xi ~ 1 for all i ~ S A T and Ye ~ > 0 for all e e E ( S - T ) u E ( T - S ) in order to obtain points in o QPLP - It follows from the total unimodularity of L * that all basic solutions to this system are { 0 , 1 } - valued and thus ( i ) follows . Part ( ii ) of the theorem follows immediately from ( i ) . Remark 2 . In the case of a complete graph we have co ( S A T ) = 1 for all S # T c V and Theorem 8 implies Theorem 2 whose proof , however , is more direct and simpler . Moreover , it follows from Theorem 8 that two vertices z s and z T of Qpc are adjacent if and only if the subgraph of G induced by S A T is connected . M . Padberg / The Boolean quadric polytope 159 Clearly , every valid inequality for QpG is valid for Qpn , whereas valid inequalities for Qpn are in general not valid for QpG when they are " restricted " to R v + z in a straighforward way . More generally , consider two graphs G = ( V , E ) and G * = ( V * , E * ) such that G is a subgraph of G * , i . e . G is either a partial subgraph or an induced subgraph of G * , see e . g . Berge ( 1973 ) . The restriction to Qpc of a valid inequality a * z < ~ ao for QpG * is obtained by discarding from a * all components ai with i c V * - V and ae with e c E * - E . The extension to QpG * of a valid inequality az < ~ ao for QpG is obtained by adding to a the new components ai = 0 for all ic V * - V and ae = 0 for all e ~ E * - E . One proves readily the following Proposition 7 . ( i ) If G is a subgraph of G * , then the extension of any valid inequality for QpG is valid for QpG * . ( ii ) The restriction of a valid inequality for QpG * is valid for QpG if G is an induced subgraph of G * . ( iii ) The restriction of a facet - defining inequality az < ~ ao for Qpo defines a facet of Qpo ~ a ) where G ( a ) is the support graph of a . Proposition 7 ( ii ) is false if we permit G to be any partial subgraph of G * because " projection " is different from the above process of " restriction " . However , as part ( iii ) states , the restriction to the support graph of a facet - defining ( or valid ) inequality always works independently of whether it is an induced subgraph or not . The proof of Lemma 1 does not utilize the completeness of the underlying graph and thus the support graph of a facet - defining inequality of QpG has the same elementary properties as described in Section 3 . More importantly , Theorem 3 like Theorem 6 do not use the completeness of the underlying graph either and hence we have in particular the following Corollary 2 . If az < ~ ao defines a facet of QpG , then its extension defines a facet of QpG * for all graphs G * that contain G as an induced subgraph . Since a sparse graph G may very well contain locally the complete subgraphs induced by the clique and cut - inequalities , the corollary implies in particular that QpG " inherits " in general many of the facets described in Section 3 . Theorem 9 . An odd - cycle inequality ( 24 ) defines a facet of QpG if and only if C is a chordless cycle of G . Moreover , if C is a chordless cycle , then Qpc = QpLcpc ~ { ( x , y ) c R 2c [ ( x , y ) satisfies all inequalities ( 24 ) } . Proof . Suppose C has a chord f ~ E . The chord divides C into two subcycles C 1 and C 2 both of which contain f Without loss of generality , suppose ] C ~ c ~ Ml ~ 0 mod2 and IC2c ~ M [ ~ l mod2 . 160 M . Padberg / The Boolean quadric polytope Define M 1 = fw ( C ~ c ~ m ) , M 2 = C2c ~ M and S ~ , S 2 , S ~ , S ~ as done in ( 23 ) using M ~ , M 2 for M , respectively . Then ( 24 ) is the sum of the two odd - cycle - inequalities x ( S 1 ) - x ( S ~ ) + y ( C ' - M l ) - y ( M 1 ) < ~ [ m , / 23 , x ( S 2 ) - x ( $ 22 ) + y ( C 2 - M 2 ) - y ( M 2 ) < ~ [ m2 / 2 ] . where ml = IMll and m2 = IM21 . Consequently , inequality ( 24 ) does not define a facet of QpG . On the other hand , let C be a chordless cycle in G . By Corollary 2 it suffices to show that the inequality ( 24 ) defines a facet of Qpc for any choice of M c C with IMI ~ l mod 2 . By Theorem 7 Qpcp has exactly as many fractional vertices as there are distinct odd - cycle inequalities ( 24 ) , i . e . QPL c has exactly 2 Ic1 - 1 fractional vertices . Moreover , dim Qpc = 21Ci ' every fractional vertex of Qpcp is nondegenerate and thus has exactly 21C I adjacent vertices . Let M1¢ M2 _ c C and z 2 z ~ , be the fractional vertices of QPL c defined by ( 23 ) using M 1 , M 2 for M , respectively . Since M 1 ~ M 2 we can assume without loss of generality that there exists geM ~ , g ~ M 2 . Define wcR 2c by setting wi = O for all itS , We = O for all e cC - g and wg e where = ~ > e > 0 . It follows that ½ ( z ~ + z2 ) + wcQP ~ p . By definition , w ¢ 0 . Suppose that w = A ( z ~ - z 2 ) for some ) t 6 R . It follows that M ~ = M2u g , which is a contradiction since both IM ' I and IM21 are odd . Consequently , z I and z 2 are not adjacent on QpCp and every fractional vertex has dim Qpc adjacent integer vertices . Consider the fractional vertex of QPLCp given by ( 25 ) . Let I denote the index set of all constraints of QPL c and Sk the slack variable associated with constraint k . Define It = { kEIlxi + xj - - ye + Sg = l , e = ( i , j ) cM } , h = { kcII - xi + ye + sk = O , e ~ C - M } . Note that I2 contains for every edge e ~ C - M the two constraints that correspond to the endpoints of edge e . I ~ u / 2 is the index set of constraints that define the fractional vertex and summing up we find 2 ( x ( So ) - x ( S2 ) + y ( C - M ) ) - y ( M ) + s ( I , u / 2 ) = IMI . Note that IMI + IL 1 + 1 / 21 - - 21 c l . Since the fractional vertex is nondegenerate it follows that every adjacent vertex on Qpep has exactly one variable Ye with e c M or one variable sk with k c I ~ u I ~ positive and that all adjacent vertices are obtained this way . Since all adjacent vertices are zero - one valued it follows that they satisfy the associated odd - cycle - inequality ( 24 ) at equality ; see e . g . Padberg ( 1972b ) for a related argument . Thus the intersection of QpCp with ( 24 ) does not create any new vertices and the theorem follows . By Corollary 2 we thus have that every cycle C without chords of the graph G defines 2 Icl 1 distinct facets of Qpc . Moreover , the Symmetry Theorem applies to sparse graphs as well , but the family of facets given by ( 24 ) is mapped into itself . M . Padberg / The Boolean quadric polytope 6 . Polynomially solvable cases of ( QP ) 161 In this section we discuss several cases where ( QPG ) ( and hence , the problem ( QP ) ) can be solved in polynomial time . This is clearly the case when ( QPG ) can be solved by solving its associated linear program max { cx + qyl ( x , y ) c QPLGp } ( QLPG ) where q is the vector with components qe for all e c E , since the size of the constraint set of ( QPL ~ p ) is polynomial in Iwl ; see Khachiyan ( 1979 ) and Karmarkar ( 1984 ) . The next proposition is an immediate consequence of the extreme point characteriz - ation of QPL % that follows from the results of Section 4 . Proposition 8 . QpG = QpLOp if and only if G is an acyclic graph . Thus ( QLPG ) soves ( QPG ) for all choices of c ~ R v and q c R e if and only if G is a forest , i . e . a collection of trees . However , QpG # QpL ~ p does not imply that ( QLPG ) does not solve ( QPG ) for certain c c R v and q ~ R ~ . Remark 3 . Denote q + the vector with components max { 0 , qe } and q - the vector with components rain { 0 , qe } for all e ~ E . Let ( x , y ) be an optimal solution to ( QLPG ) and set S = { ic Vlx , = ½ } , T = { i ~ Vlx , = l } . ( 26 ) If qe < 0 for some e ~ E ( S ) , then Ye = 0 because otherwise ye = ½ and setting Ye equal to zero yields a feasible solution with a better objective function value , which contradicts the optimality of ( x , y ) . Likewise , it follows that qe > 0 for some e ~ E ( S ) implies Ye = ½ . If qe = 0 for some eeE ( S ) then we can set y ~ = ½ in any optimal solution to ( QLPc ) without loss of generality . By feasibility of ( x , y ) it follows that Ye = ½ for all e c ( S : T ) . By Theorem 7 the optimal objective function value of ( QLPG ) is thus given by cx + qy = ¢ ( T ) + ½c ( S ) + ½q + ( E ( S ) ) + ½q ( S : T ) + q ( E ( T ) ) . Of course , S or T or both may be empty in an optimal solution to ( QLPG ) . Proposition 9 . Let ( x , y ) be an optimal solution to ( QLPG ) and S and T be defined as in ( 26 ) . Then z s ~ r is an optimal solution to ( QPG ) if and only if c ( S ) + q + ( E ( S ) ) + q ( S : T ) > 1 - 2q - ( E ( S ) ) . ( 27 ) z T is an optimal solution to ( QPG ) if and only if c ( S ) + q + ( E ( S ) ) + q ( S : T ) ~ O . Furthermore , if q > 1 0 then ( 27 ) is always satisfied . 162 M . Padberg / The Boolean quadric polytope Proof . We show that the objective function value of z s ~ r is greater than or equal to the optimum value ex + qy if and only if ( 27 ) is satisfied : e ( Su T ) + q ( E ( Su T ) ) = e ( S ) + c ( T ) + q ( E ( S ) ) + q ( S : T ) + q ( E ( T ) ) = c ( S ) + q + ( E ( S ) ) + q - ( E ( S ) ) + q ( S : T ) + c ( T ) + q ( E ( T ) ) > ~ ½c ( S ) + ½q + ( E ( S ) ) + ½q ( S : T ) + c ( T ) + q ( E ( T ) ) = ex + qy The last equation follows from Remark 3 . The second part of Proposition 9 follows likewise . Furthermore , z T is a feasible ( suboptimal ) solution in any case and comparing its objective function to the optimal one shows that the condition ( 27 ) is always satisfied if q ~ > 0 . The proposition follows . Proposition 9 states sufficient conditions that guarantee polynomial solvability of ( QP ) . It implies , in particular , the result of Picard and Ratlitt ( 1975 ) as regards the complexity of ( QP ) in the case where q ~ > 0 and gives an alternative way to compute an optimal solution for these instances of ( QP ) in polynomial time . ( This result can also be obtained by observing that q ~ > 0 implies that constraints ( 4 ) can be dropped from the formulation of ( QP ~ p ) and that the constraint matrix consisting of ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) is totally unimodular . Of course , in this case the upperbound constraints xi < ~ 1 for all i ~ V have to be added . ) Since every maximum - cut problem can be expressed as an unconstrained quadratic zero - one problem , see Hammer ( 1965 ) , it also gives a very general sufficient condition for the maximum - cut problem to be solvable in polynomial time . Proposition 10 . Let G - - ( VI , V2 , E ) be a bipartite graph and qe < O for all e c 17 , . Then every optimal solution to ( QLPc ) is zero - one valued . Proof . Let ( x , y ) be an optimal solution to ( QLP ~ ) and assume that S = { i ~ VlW V2lxi = ½ } is nonempty . Since qe < 0 for all ecE it follows that ye = 0 for all e ~ E ( S ) in any optimal solution . Hence by Remark 1 the partial subgraph of G induced by S and the set of " missing " edges contains at least one odd cycle . This a contradiction , since G is bipartite . Every vertex - packing problem can be expressed as an unconstrained quadratic program with negative coefficients in the quadratic form , see Hammer Rosenberg ( 1964 ) . Thus Proposition 10 implies the well - known result that vertex - packing in bipartite graphs is polynomially solvable . Furthermore , the assumption qe < 0 for all e c E in Proposition 10 can evidently be relaxed to qe < ~ 0 for all e c E . In this case the assertion of Proposition 10 has to be modified to read that there exists an optimal solution to ( QLP ~ ) that is zero - one valued . To find an optimal zer0 - one M . Padberg / The Boolean quadric polytope 163 solution in this case one solves the problem ( QLP ~ . ) on the graph G * obtained from G by dropping all zero - weight edges and all resulting isolated vertices , if any . The only other case in which we know ( QPG ) to be solvable in polynomial time is the case where G is a series - parallel graph , see Barahona ( 1986 ) . By a result of Padberg and Rao ( 1981 ) , see also GrStschel , Lovasz and Schrijver ( 1981 ) , we thus know that the problem of algorithmic facet - identification for the associated Boolean quadric polytope can be done in polynomial time as well . The nice structure of series - parallel graphs , see e . g . Mahjoub ( 1988 ) , suggests one to conjecture that the odd - cycle inequalities and the trivial facets describe the polytope QP ~ completely . This is indeed the case and generalizing an argument due to Mahjoub ( 1988 ) , we prove the following . Theorem 10 . If G is a series - parallel graph , then every nontrivial facet of QP ~ is an odd - cycle inequality ( 24 ) . We start by proving the following two lemmata which are true for arbitrary graphs G of the type considered in this paper . Lemma 5 . Let az < ~ ao define a nontrivial facet of QP ~ , let u ~ V have degree two and p , q be the two neighbors of u in the support graph G ( a ) of az < ~ ao . ( i ) If a . < 0 , then a . + a . v = a ~ + auq = O . ( ii ) If aup % 0 and a ~ q < O , then a . + a ~ v = a ~ + a ~ q = O . ( iii ) If a . p > 0 and a . q < O , then a . = 0 and a . p + auq = O . ( iv ) If a ~ > O , then a ~ + aup = au + auq = 0 . ( V ) If aup > 0 and auq > O , then a ~ + a ~ p = a ~ + auq = O . Proof . We let Fo = { z c QPGlaz = ao } . By Proposition 7 , part ( iii ) , we can assume without loss of generality that G = G ( a ) is the support graph of the inequality az < ~ ao . ( i ) Suppose that all z c QpG with xu = Xp = 1 , x o = 0 satisfy az < ao . Then there exists z I c F . such that xu = 1 , Xp = x , = 0 , since otherwise - xu + Yuq = 0 for all z c Fa . But then z 2 obtained from z 1 by setting xu = 0 is feasible and az 2 = az ~ - au > ao , which is a contradiction . Consequently , there exists a z ~ Fa with xu = xp = 1 , xq = O . The point z 1 obtained from z by setting xu = yup = 0 is also feasible and thus au + aup ~ O . By symmetry , we have au + auq ~ O . Suppose now that au + aup > O . Then all z c QpG such that Xp = 1 , xu = Xq = 0 , satisfy az < ao since otherwise we set xu = y . p = 1 and get z a c Qpc with az ~ = ao + au + a . p > ao , which is a contradiction . But then there exists z ~ ~ Fa such that Xp = Xq = 1 , xu = 0 , since otherwise - xp + y . p = 0 for all z c F . . Consequently , the point z 2 obtained from z I by setting xu = y . p = Yuq = 1 is feasible and hence we have a . + aup - F auq ~ O . But a . < O , a . + aup ~ O , a . + auq ~ 0 and a ~ + a . p + a . q < ~ 0 is impossible and consequently , au + aup = 0 . By symmetry , we have a . + auq = 0 as well . 164 M . Padberg / The Boolean quadric polytope ( ii ) By part ( i ) it follows that au / > 0 . Suppose that au = 0 . If there exists z 6 Fa such that xp = xu = 1 , Xq = 0 , then the point Z 1 obtained from z by setting x , = yup = 0 is feasible and az ~ = ao - au p > ao , which is a contradiction . If there exists z c Fa such that xp = x ~ = Xq = 1 , then setting xu = y , p = Yuq = 0 we get a similar contradiction . But then all z c Fa satisfy Yup = 0 which is also a contradiction . Consequently , au > 0 and applying the Symmetry Theorem with M = { u } the assertion follows from part ( i ) . ( iii ) Suppose a , ¢ 0 . Then by part ( i ) we have a ~ > 0 . Now we apply the mapping 0M of the Symmetry Theorem with M = { u } . Then we get a facet dz < ~ do of QP ~ with d , = - a , < 0 , d , p = - aup ~ 0 and duq ~ - - auq > 0 . By part ( i ) this is impossible and thus a ~ = 0 . If there exists z ~ Fa such that xp = 0 , x , = Xq = 1 , then z ~ obtained from z by setting x , = Yuq = 0 is feasible and cut off by az < ~ ao , which is a contradic - tion . Consequently , all z c QpG with Xp = 0 , x ~ = Xq = 1 , satisfy az < ao . It follows that there exists z 6 F , such that x , = xp = Xq = 1 since otherwise y ~ p = 0 for all z c F , . Hence Z 1 obtained from z by setting x . = y ~ p = Yuq = 0 is feasible and thus aup d - auq O . If a . p + a . q > 0 , then all zc Qpc with x . = 0 , xp = Xq = 1 , satisfy az < ao . Con - sequently , there exists z c Fo with xp = 1 , x . = Xq = O , since otherwise - xp + yup = 0 for all z ~ Fo . But then z ~ obtained from z by setting x . = y . p ~ - 1 satisfies az 1 = ao + a . p > ao , which is a contradiction . Consequently , aup + a . q = O . ( iv ) and ( v ) follow from ( i ) and ( ii ) , respectively , using the Symmetry Theorem with M = { u } and thus the lemma follows . Lemma 6 . Let az < ~ ao define a nontrivial facet of QP ~ and let G ( a ) be its corresponding support graph . If G ( a ) contains a cycle C without chords such that at most two nodes of C have degree greater than two , then az < ~ ao is an odd - cycle inequality ( 24 ) . Proof . If C has no nodes of degree greater than two , then the assertion follows from Lemma 1 , part ( iii ) , and Theorem 9 . By Lemma 1 , part ( iv ) , G ( a ) cannot contain exactly one node of degree greater than two . So assume that C has exactly two nodes p and q that have degree greater than two . Then there exist two paths with edge sets L1 and L2 in G ( a ) that connect p and q and C = L1 u L2 . Denote by P1 , P2 the respective ( intermediate ) node sets of the two paths excepting p and q . Then every node in P ~ has degree two in G ( a ) for i = 1 , 2 . By Lemma 1 , part ( v ) , it follows that [ Li ] / > 2 and thus ] Pd ~ > 1 for i = 1 , 2 . Since the odd - cycle inequalities ( 24 ) are mapped into themselves under the mapping ~ PM of the Symmetry Theorem , the assertion of the lemma remains unchanged if we subject az < ~ ao to this mapping . It follows from Lemma 5 that we can assume without loss of generality that ai = c ~ > 0 for all i c P1 and ae = - - a for all e c L1 , by applying the mapping 0M with M = { i } for i c P1 ~ { P , q } if necessary . Let u c P2 be the neighbor of p and v c P2 be the neighbor of q in C . By the preceding we determine the sign of aue and a ~ p as well . However , as before we can assume without loss of generality that a ~ = / 3 > 0 for all icP2 - { u , v } and ae = - fl for all e ~ L2 - { ( u , p ) , ( v , q ) } . As for the remaining coefficients we have three distinct cases : M . Padberg / The Boolean quadric polytope 165 Case a : au , > 0 and avp > O . In this case we can assume u # v and thus au = a ~ = O , aup = avq = [ 3 . Case b : aup > 0 and a ~ p < 0 . Then we have aup = / 3 , a ~ = 0 , avv = - / 3 and a ~ = fi if u ~ v . Case c : aup < 0 and a ~ p < 0 . Then we have aup = % p = - ] 3 and a ~ = a ~ = / 3 . Of course , this leaves the coefficients ap and aq still undefined . Adding the inequalities xi + xj - yij < ~ 1 for ( i , j ) ¢ L1 we obtain 2x ( P1 ) - y ( L , ) < ~ [ L , ] - xp - Xq and thus all ( x , y ) e Qpo satisfy a ' z : = x ( PO - y ( LO ~ [ ( ] L , [ - xp - Xq ) / 2J . ( 28 ) Moreover , there exists ( x , y ) 6 Qpc such that ( 28 ) holds at equality for all possible 1 choices of xp , XqC { O , 1 } . To prove this , let ( u , p ) , ( v , q ) cLl and set xf = 5 for all i c P ~ , y , p = xp / 2 , y ~ q = Xq / 2 and Ye = 0 for e ¢ L ~ otherwise . Applying Proposition 8 to the graph G * = ( P1u { p , q } , L ~ ) we find that the maximum of x ( P1 ) - y ( L1 ) over QP ~ * is precisely the right - hand of ( 28 ) since it is integer and at least ( ] L ~ ] - xp - Xq - 1 ) / 2 . Let z 6 F , and suppose that ( 28 ) holds as a strict inequality . Change x ~ , Y / 2 for i c P ~ and ( i , j ) ¢ L1 leaving the remaining components of z unchanged such that the resulting point z ~ e QPO satisfies ( 28 ) at equality . But then az ~ ~ - aa l z 1 q - a * z 1 ~ aa lz + a * z = az = ao , where a * is obtained from the vector a by setting all components with index in P ~ u L ~ equal to zero , shows the contradiction . Thus all z c F , satisfy ( 28 ) at equality . Case a : Adding the inequalities x , + xj - yq ~ < 1 for all ( i , j ) 6 L2 - { ( u , p ) , ( v , q ) } , - - Xu q - Yup ~ O , - - X v q - yup < ~ O , - - X ~ + y ~ q < ~ O , - - Xq + Yvq < ~ 0 we find that a2z : = x ( P2 - { u , v } ) + Y , v + Yvq - - Y ( L ~ 2 ) ~ [ ( Ig ~ [ - [ - Xp Dr _ Xq ) / 2J ( 29 ) holds for all ( x , y ) 6 Qpc where L * = L2 - { ( u , p ) , ( v , q ) } . One proves as before that there exist ( x , y ) e Qpc satisfying ( 29 ) at equality for all possible choices of xp , Xq C { 0 , 1 } and thus as before every z e F ~ satisfies ( 29 ) at equality . If IL ~ [ + [ L * ] is odd , then every z c F ~ satisfies ( al q - a2 ) z = [ ( [ L , l - xp - Xq ) / 2 j + t ( lg * l + xp + Xq ) / 2 ] = [ ( Ig , l + lLNI ) / 2 ] and thus az < ~ ao is the odd - cycle inequality ( 24 ) given by a ~ + a e and the corre - sponding right - hand side . Suppose now that ILd + [ L * I is even . Then every z 6 F ~ satisfies ( a ' - a2 ) z = { ( ILd - xp - Xq ) / 2 ] - [ ( [ L * l + xp + x , ) / 2 ] = ( [ L , l - [ L2 * [ ) / 2 - ( xp + Xq ) 166 M . Padberg / The Boolean quadric polytope and thus xp - ~ - Xq ~ - ( a I - a2 ) z = ( ILll - ] L * ] ) / 2 . ( 30 ) Since Qpo is full - dimensional , every facet - defining inequality is unique up to multiplication by a positive scalar and thus every equation that is satisfied by all points of a facet is unique up to multiplication by a scalar y , say . Since aup > 0 and a2e < 0 we thus have y < 0 . But letting i c PI be the neighbor of p we have aip < O , < 0 and thus y > 0 . Consequently , IZll + lt ~ * l cannot be even and the lemma a ip follows in this case . Case b : Adding the inequalities xi + xj - y , s ~ 1 for all ( i , j ) c L2 - ( u , p ) , - x , , + Yup < ~ 0 and - xp + y , , p < ~ 0 one obtains the valid inequality corresponding to ( 29 ) to be given by a2z : = x ( P2 - u ) + Xq + Yu , , - y ( L * 2 ) < ~ { ( IL y ] + xp + Xq ) / 2J , and as before all z ¢ Fa satisfy this inequality as an equation , where L * = L2 - ( u , p ) . If ILI [ + ILY [ is odd , we obtain as before that az < ~ ao is the odd - cycle inequality , x ( Pl ~ 1 ' 2 - u ) + Xq - { - Yup - - y ( L , w L * ) < ~ [ ( ] L , I + IL2 * l / 2J , while the case where Itll + lt ~ * l is even leads to a contradiction as in the first case . Case c : Adding the inequalities xi + x ~ - yo ~ < 1 for all ( i , j ) ¢ L2 one obtains the valid inequality corresponding to ( 29 ) to be given by a Zz : = x ( P2 ) - y ( L2 ) < ~ { ( IL2l - xp - Xq ) / 2J and as before all z¢ F , satisfy this inequality as an equation . If [ Lll + lL2P is odd then for all xp , Xq ¢ { 0 , 1 } we have [ ( lAd - x , - Xq ) / 2 ] + [ ( IL = l - x , - xq ) / 2J = [ ( ILlI + IL21 ) / 2 ] - Xp - Xq and thus az < ~ ao is the odd - cycle inequality given by xp + xq + x ( P1 ~ P2 ) - y ( L , u L2 ) < ~ [ ( ILl [ + Itzl ) / 2J • If ILd + lL21 is even , then we find L ( [ L , ] - xn - Xq ) / 2h - L ( [ L21 - xp - x ~ ) / 2 ] = ( [ Ell - IL2l ) / 2 and we contradict as before . The lemma follows . Proof of Theorem 10 . Let az < ~ ao be a nontrivial facet of Qpc and G ( a ) its support graph . Then the restriction of az < ~ ao defines a facet of Qpc ( a ) , G ( a ) is series - parallel and thus we can assume without loss of generality that G = G ( a ) . By Lemma 1 , M . Padberg / The Boolean quadric polytope 167 part ( iv ) , it follows that G is biconnected and hence , see Mahjoub ( 1988 ) , G contains a cycle C satisfying the condition of Lemma 6 . The theorem follows . 7 . Relatives of the Boolean quadric polytope The results that we have obtained so far are remindful of similar results obtained along polyhedral lines for other problems such as the vertex - packing polytope , see Balas and Padberg ( 1976 ) and Padberg ( 1979 ) for surveys ; the cut - polytope , see Barahona and Mahjoub ( 1986 ) ; the bipartite - subgraph polytope ( i . e . the " monotonization " of the cut - polytope ) , see Barahona , Gr6tschel and Mahjoub ( 1985 ) ; the clique - partitioning polytope , see Gr6tschel and Wakabayashi ( 1987 ) ; the equipartition polytope , see Conforti , Rao and Sassano ( 1987 ) ; and possibly , polytopes associated with other structured zero - one linear programming problems as well . Rather than attempting to explore all possible relations at this time , we restrict ourselves here to the most obvious relative of the Boolean quadric polytope : the vertex - packing polytope . Let G = ( V , E ) be a finite undirected graph . Then VP G = conv { x ~ { 0 , 1 } Vlxi + xj < ~ 1 for all ( i , j ) c E } is the vertex - packing polytope associated with G and VP ~ p = { xc RV [ xi + xj < ~ 1 for all ( i , j ) ~ E , xi ~ > 0 for all ic V } its linear relaxation . Since VP G = QPGc ~ { ( x , y ) cRV + Elye = O for all e ~ E } , VP ~ p = QP ~ p ~ { ( x , y ) ~ R v + e lYe = 0 for all e ~ E } , we have the following : Proposition 11 . VP G ( VP ~ p ) is a [ VI - dimensionalface of QpG ( Qp ~ p ) . It follows that all results of this paper have their counterpart on VP ~ and VP ~ p , respectively . Thus the extreme - point characterization of QP ~ p ( Theorem 7 ) implies the extreme - point characterization of VP ~ p due to Balinski ( 1970a ) , see also Padberg ( 1971 ) and Trotter ( 1973 ) . Theorem 8 implies the adjacency characterization on VP a due to Padberg and Rao ( 1974 ) and Chvfital ( 1975 ) . The first part of Theorem 9 becomes false and the second part quasi obvious when stated for VP c , see Padberg ( 1973 ) . Theorem 10 implies the characterization of VP G when G is a series - parallel graph due to Boulala and Uhry ( 1979 ) , see also Mahjoub ( 1988 ) . This characteri - zation of VP G was formulated by Chvfital as a conjecture after he succeeded in 168 M . Padberg / The Boolean quadric polytope demolishing a related more general conjecture of Padberg ( 1972a ) , see Chv ~ tal ( 1972 ) . It would be interesting to know if Chv ~ ital ' s theorem ( 1975 , Theorem 3 . 1 ) concerning the characterization of VP ° when G is a perfect graph which was known to Ray Fulkerson , see Trotter ( 1973 , Theorem 3 . 18 ) , and Padberg ' s theorem regarding almost perfect graphs ( 1976 , Theorem 1 . 5 ) have their equivalents for the polytope Qpo . In the case of a perfect graph , all nontrivial facets of VP ° are obtained from the maximal cliques of G . As regards the polytope QpG , we know by Theorem 4 that for every complete subgraph of G of size s ~ > 3 we have s - 2 distinct facets of QpG . When QP ~ is intersected with Ye = 0 for all e e E , then evidently all but the inequalities related to maximal cliques are " dominated " . Moreover , since the com - plete graph Kn is perfect , we need a complete description of QW . Thus it is prima facie most unlikely that perfection of G leads to another " solvable " case of ( QPG ) . For perfect G , however , the packing problem over VP G is solvable in polynomial time , see Gr6tschel , Lovasz and Schrijver ( 1984 ) . Another question that is of interest is to decide whether or not the " fixing " result of Nemhauser and Trotter ( 1975 ) for the vertex - packing problem generalizes to the problem considered here . Their result states that all variables that assume the value 1 in an optimal solution over VP ~ p v for a given c c R + assume the value 1 in an optimal solution over VP a for the same vector c . As we can assume that c ~ > 0 for all i c V , it follows that all nodes i c V with xi = 1 or xs = 0 in an optimal solution over VP ~ p can be fixed and dropped from the problem . At present we do not know whether or not this result carries over to the polytopes Qpc and QP ~ p . With respect to finding a larger class of facets of QpG than described in this paper , several avenues are worth pursuing . It is clear , however , that the sequential lifting procedure of Padberg ( 1973 and 1975 ) and the simultaneous lifting procedure of Zemel ( 1978 ) for general zero - one problems can be adapted to produce facets of QpG from the ( known ) facets of VP G . We give here a simplified construction of this kind as an example . Define fie = max { axlx c VP G e , xi = xj = 1 } where e - - - ( i , j ) c E and ax < ~ ao is some nontrivial valid inequality for VP G . Clearly , we can assume that a ~ > 0 for all i e V and we have / 3e < ~ ao + min { aj , aj } . ( 31 ) Proposition 12 . ( i ) The inequality ax - by : = ~ aixi - ~ min { ai , aj } yij < ~ a0 i ~ V ( i , . j ) c E is valid for Qpo . ( ii ) If equality holds in ( 31 ) for all e c E , then ( 32 ) defines a facet of QpG . Let ax < ~ ao define a nontrivial facet of VP G such that ai > 0 for i c V . ( 32 ) M . Padberg / The Boolean quadric polytope 169 ( iii ) If the subgraph induced by N ( i ) - j or by N ( j ) - i is a complete graph for all ( i , j ) c E , then ( 31 ) is always satisfied at equality , where N ( i ) are the neighbors of i ~ V . Proof . ( i ) Let R _ ~ V . Then we have ai - Z min { ai , aj } = Y ~ ai ~ ao . i ~ R ( i , j ) ~ E ( R ) i ~ S S _ ~ V is an independent ( or stable ) set in G , i . e . i ¢j c S implies ( i , j ) Z E , because for any pair i # j c R with ( i , j ) c E ( R ) the minimum of ai and a ~ is subtracted from the sum of all ai with i ~ R . Consequently , the last inequality follows from the validity of ax < ~ ao for VP c and thus ( 32 ) defines a valid inequality for QpG . ( ii ) Since ax < ~ ao defines a nontrivial facet of VP c , there exist [ vl linearly independent points ( x , y ) c QP ~ satisfying ax = ao and Ye : 0 for all e c E . If ( 31 ) holds as an equation for all e ~ E , then for each e c E there exists a point ( x , y ) ~ QP ~ satisfying ( 32 ) at equality and having Ye : 1 , Xt = 0 for all fc E - e . This gives additional IEI points of Qpc that are linearly independent among themselves and of the Iv [ previous points . ( iii ) Let e = ( i , j ) c E and suppose that we have inequality in ( 31 ) . Then every point x c VP c with xj = 1 that satisfies ax = ao also satisfies X i - ~ - ~ X k = 1 , k ~ N ( i ) ~ or every point x ~ VP ~ with x / = 1 that satisfies ax = ao also satisfies the same equation with N ( i ) - j replaced by N ( j ) - i and x ~ replaced by xj . It follows that either G is a clique ( in which case inequality in ( 31 ) does not hold ) or that ax < ~ ao does not define a facet of VP G , which is a contradiction . The proposition follows . It follows that many ( but not all ) facets of VP c give rise to facets of Qpc and thus QpG shares all the complexities of the vertex - packing polytope , see Trotter ( 1975 ) , Wolsey ( 1976 ) , Padberg ( 1977 ) . It is clear , on the other hand , that every facet - defining inequality ax - by < ~ ao gives rise to the valid inequality ax < ~ ao of VP ~ which , however , is generally not facet - defining for VP G . The precise relationship between the facets of VP ~ and Qpc as well as the relationship of QP ~ to the polytopes mentioned earlier is left for future work .

Notes added in Proof ( 1 ) Alvin Klevorick pointed out to us that our particular linearization ( 4 ) , . . . , ( 8 ) of the quadratic term xixj was also used by him in his Ph . D . thesis ( Economics Department , Princeton , 1967 ) . Using the fact that the integratity requirement on the y ~ variables can be dropped , one obtains a mixed - integer programming formulation of ( QP ) that he proposed to solve algorithmically using Bender ' s decomposition . ( 2 ) Since this paper was written we found ( May , 1988 ) that the Boolean quadric polytope Qpc is in one - to - one correspondence with the cut polytope CP ( G + x ) studied by Barahona and Mahjoub ( 1986 ) where x is a node not in G that is joined to all nodes of G . Thus some of our results can be interpreted on the cut polytope defined with respect to G + x and vice versa . References E .
