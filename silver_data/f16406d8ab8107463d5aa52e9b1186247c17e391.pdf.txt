Like many extracellular signaling proteins , TNF is synthesized as a transmembrane protein ; the active signal is its ectodomain , which is shed from cells after cleavage by an ADAM family metalloprotease , ADAM17 ( TNF a - converting enzyme , TACE ) . We report that iRhom2 ( RHBDF2 ) , a proteolytically inactive member of the rhomboid family , is required for TNF release in mice . iRhom2 binds TACE and promotes its exit from the endoplasmic reticulum . The failure of TACE to exit the endoplasmic reticulum in the absence of iRhom2 prevents the furin - mediated maturation and trafficking of TACE to the cell surface , the site of TNF cleavage . Given the role of TNF in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases , iRhom2 may represent an attractive therapeutic target . P roteolytic release of the extracellular do - main of transmembrane proteins is an im - portant mechanism for generating signals that regulate major aspects of animal devel - opment , physiology , immunity , and pathology ( 1 , 2 ) . An important example of regulated ecto - domain shedding is the cytokine tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) , the primary trigger of inflammatory responses . TNF is associated with many human diseases , including rheumatoid arthritis , Crohn ' s disease , atherosclerosis , psoriasis , sepsis , diabetes , and obesity . Its blockade is licensed as a therapy for a number of conditions and is being assessed for others ( 3 ) . Soluble , active TNF is shed from the plasma membrane by the ADAM family me - talloprotease TACE ( TNF a - converting enzyme , also known as ADAM17 ) ( 4 ) . Despite the medi - cal importance of TNF and other transmembrane signaling proteins , the regulation of ectodomain shedding remains poorly understood . Both the transmembrane forms of the signaling proteins themselves and the shedding proteases are sub - ject to control by posttranslational modification , interaction with specific partners , and regulated intracellular trafficking and compartmentaliza - tion ( 5 – 9 ) . The relativephysiological importance , however , of these different modes of regulation is unclear . We have investigated the regulation of ecto - domain shedding by genetic and cellular ap - proaches , both in Drosophila and mammalian cells . This has led to the recent discovery of a new class of polytopic endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) proteins , the iRhoms , which are noncat - alytic relatives of rhomboid intramembrane proteases ( Fig . 1A ) ( 10 ) . Drosophila iRhom reg - ulates epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor signaling by interacting with EGF family ligands in the ER , shunting them into the ER - associated degradation ( ERAD ) pathway ( 11 ) . iRhoms are conserved in all metazoans , and in cell culture assays , their mammalian counterparts , iRhom1 and iRhom2 , can also promote ERAD of EGF . In mammals , however , their physiological role is unknown . We therefore generated a null mutation in the gene that encodes iRhom2 ( RHBDF2 ) in mice ( 12 ) ( fig . S1A ) . iRhom2 − / − ( knockout , KO ) mice appeared normal : They were viable and fertile , with no morphological defects . Unlike iRhom1 , which is widely expressed , iRhom2 is predominantly expressed in immune cells , par - ticularly macrophages ( 13 , 14 ) , where its expres - sion was specifically up - regulated in response to lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) stimulation ( Fig . 1B ) . We therefore challenged iRhom2 − / − mice with LPS , to mimic bacterial infection , and measured the serum concentration of proinflammatory cy - tokines . Interleukin - 1 b ( IL - 1 b ) , IL - 6 , and IL - 12 were induced normally but , remarkably , TNF induction was almost completely abolished in mutant mice ( Fig . 1C ) . Macrophages are the most abundant source of TNF ; consistent with this , in vitro differentiated bone marrow – derived macrophages ( BMDMs ) from iRhom2 − / − mice failedtosecreteTNFinresponsetoLPS ( Fig . 1D ) . The failure of TNF secretion in iRhom2 − / − mice [ confirmed in this issue ; see ( 15 ) ] is not caused by its loss of expression : RNA levels were unaffected ( fig . S2A ) , and protein levels were actually elevated in iRhom2 − / − macrophages ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . This result was confirmed by cell surface labeling followed by affinity precipi - tation , which showed an increase in the accu - mulation of the full - length , membrane - tethered form of TNF on the plasma membrane of mutant cells ( Fig . 2C ) . Furthermore , inhibition of the shedding protease TACE in wild - type ( WT ) cells by the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor BB94 ( Fig . 2 , A and C ) resulted in a phenotype similar to iRhom2 − / − macrophages . Together , these data imply that loss of iRhom2 does not interfere with the induction or intracellular trafficking of TNF but instead suggests a shedding defect . We tested this hypothesis directly . Although TACE levels were normal in both WTandmutantmacrophages ( Fig . 2D ) , lossofiRhom2ledtoacompleteabolition of activity of immunoprecipitated TACE ( Fig . 2E and fig . S2B ) . This result explains the loss of TNF shedding in mutant mice and macrophages . Like TNF , TACE has been the focus of major pharmaceutical interest : Not only does it regulate inflammation through TNF , but it is also im - plicated in cancer by activating EGF receptor ligands ( 16 ) ; furthermore , it is a point of inte - gration for a wide range of incoming signals ( 17 ) . Despite this intense spotlight , TACE regulation remains poorly understood . Several lines of evi - dence suggest the trafficking of enzyme to the plasma membrane is important , but other work implies that , at least in some contexts , the rate - limiting step may be activation of molecules already at the cell surface ( 5 – 7 , 18 , 19 ) . Because most evidence agrees that the plasma membrane is the primary site of TACE activity , we tested 1 Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology , Hills Road , Cambridge CB2 0QH , UK . 2 Cambridge Research Institute , Cancer Research UK , Li Ka Shing Centre , Robinson Way , Cambridge CB2 0RE , UK . * Present address : Boehringer Ingelheim , NBE Discovery , Dr .

E - mail : MF1 @ mrc - lmb . cam . ac . uk www . sciencemag . org SCIENCE VOL 335 13 JANUARY 2012 225 REPORTS whether TACE was present at the cell surface of iRhom2 − / − cells . In contrast to WT cells , no TACE was found on the surface of iRhom2 − / − macrophages ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) , which implies that the cause of TACE inactivity is a fundamen - tal defect in its intracellular trafficking . Endoglycosidase - H ( endo - H ) – sensitive N - glycans are added to TACE in the ER . The sug - ars are then elaborated in the Golgi apparatus , becoming resistant to endo - H . Later in the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) , the inhibitory N - terminal prodomain is removed by furin ( 20 ) . These mod - ifications can be used to track the progress of TACE from the ER to the plasma membrane ( see fig . S2 , CandD , foranoverview ) . Consistentwith previous reports ( 7 , 20 ) , we found the majority of endogenous TACE to be endo - H – sensitive and , therefore , located in the ER in both WT and mu - tant cells ( Fig . 3C ) . In the absence of iRhom2 , however , TACE never became endo - H resistant , which demonstrated that it was unable to reach the site of addition of Golgi - specific glycans as it does in WT cells ( Fig . 3C , bracket ) . Further - more , furin cleavage of the prodomain was abol - ished in the KO cells ( Fig . 3C , white arrowhead ) . We conclude that trafficking from the ER is a limitingstepforTACEmaturationandthatiRhom2isanessentialcomponentofthemechanismthatreleasesittotheGolgiapparatus . WithoutiRhom2 , therefore , TACE cannot reach the TGN to be activated . Our results are consistent with iRhom2 being a rate - limiting factor in releasing TACE from the ER . Toexaminethisdirectly , weexpressedmouse iRhom2 in human embryonic kidney ( HEK ) cells and as - sayeditseffectonendogenoushumanTACE . Over - expression of iRhom2 caused excessTACE to leave the ER , which resulted in more furin - processed TACE ( Fig . 3D , white arrow ) , and this translated into an overall increase in TACE enzyme activity ( Fig . 3E ) . This result demonstrates that iRhom2 is rate - limiting for TACE activity and also indicates conservation of human and mouse iRhom2 func - tion . This was confirmed by showing that knock - down of human iRhom2 expression by RNA interference ( RNAi ) inhibited the maturation of endogenous TACE in human cells ( Fig . 3F ) . How might iRhom2 control trafficking of TACE ? Because most TACE resides in the ER , which is also where the bulk of iRhom2 is de - tected in COS cells ( 11 ) , we asked whether they can bind to each other directly . Indeed , when coexpressed in HEK cells , mouse iRhom2 ef - ficiently immunoprecipitated tagged mouse TACE ( Fig . 4A and fig . S3A ) , whereas multiple control transmembrane proteins showed no in - teraction with iRhom2 ( Fig . 4 , A and F ; and fig . S3 , A and B ) . Conversely , tagged iRhom2 was immunoprecipitated by endogenous TACE ( fig . S3C ) . Moreover , we found that both endogenous TACE and iRhom2 proteins could coimmuno - precipitate one another in macrophages ( Fig . 4 , B and C ) . iRhom2 interacts with both endogenous full - length TACE and the mature form ( Fig . 4A ; black and white arrowheads , respectively ) , al - though by increasing the stringency of the bind - ing and washing conditions , we found that the interaction is weaker once the TACE prodomain is removed ( Fig . 4D ; immature and mature TACE indicated by black and white arrowheads , respec - tively ) . We also tested whether iRhom2 interacts with ADAM10 , TACE ’ s closest relative ( 16 ) . In contrast to TACE , no interaction ( Fig . 4A ) or ef - fect on ADAM10 trafficking ( Fig . 4E ) was de - tected , which indicated a high level of specificity of iRhom2 for potential client proteins . The membrane - permeable chemical cross - linker dithiobis ( succinimidyl propionate ) ( DSP ) could cross - link iRhom2 to both full - length and mature TACE ( Fig . 4F ; black and white arrow - heads , respectively ) in living HEK cells , which implied that the interaction occurs in vivo and that the two proteins are less than 12 Å apart . Therefore , the binding is probably direct . To - gether , these data make astrongcase thatiRhom2 binds directly to TACE and so regulates its traf - ficking from the ER . We envisage two alternative models to explain these results . Either iRhom2 is required in the ER for the folding and / or mat - uration of TACE , or it acts like a cargo receptor to assist the onward trafficking of TACE . In support of the latter model , we find that iRhom2 in macrophages carries endo - H – resistant , Golgi - Fig . 1 . iRhom2 is essential for LPS - induced TNF shedding .

This is consistent with the observed binding in vivo of iRhom2 to both full - length and mature TACE . The reduction in affinity once the prodo - mainisremovedsuggestspossiblereleaseofTACEfromiRhom2onceactivatedbyfurin ( although we emphasize that this last interpretation is specula - tive ) . In further support of our model , and as an argument against TACE folding being substantially disrupted , catalytically inactive TACE immuno - precipitated from iRhom2 KO cells ( Fig . 2E ) can be made active by incubation with recombinant furin ( Fig . 4H ) . This indicates that lack of access to furin is the primary cause of TACE inactivity . Thesedata , alongwithourpreviousresults ( 11 ) , suggest that iRhoms are polytopic membrane proteins that bind to single - pass transmembrane proteins in the ER and so regulate their subsequent trafficking ( Fig . 4I ) . Depending on the specific iRhom , theclient , and / orthecellularcontext , iRhoms can promote exit from ER , or degradation ( 11 ) . TheERexitofsomeToll - likereceptors , whichalso have a single transmembrane domain ( TMD ) , de - pends on an unrelated polytopic membrane pro - tein , Unc93b1 ( 21 ) . Perhaps trafficking assistance for proteins with single TMDs is common ; they may require specific cargo reception machinery , or alternatively , TMD chaperones may prevent non - specific TMD interactions . There is a family of other nonproteolytic rhomboidlike proteins that also lack defining features of iRhoms , including , very distantly , derlins ( 10 , 22 ) . It is possible that this wider group of rhomboidlike membrane pro - teins may also interact with , and regulate , the fate of single - pass transmembrane proteins . This work provides a mechanistic explanation for why TNF production is abolished in iRhom2 KO mice . Note that iRhom2 expression is itself Fig . 2 .

( B ) Biotinylated cell surface proteins were deglycosylated with endo - H ( H ) , which cleaves ER , but not Golgi , N - glycans , or N - glycosidase F ( PNGase F ) ( F ) , which removes both . Cell surface TACE is endo - H – resistant ( black arrowhead ) . TACE matures by acquiring Golgi N - glycans and by furin - catalyzed removal of the prodomain .

Pos - itive feedback can sharpen physiological signaling responses — but can also promote hyperactivity if normal regulation is disrupted — and underlies a variety of inflammatory and oncogenic patholo - gies ( 24 ) . The further medical implication of this work is the potential of interfering with iRhom2 or its binding to TACE as a strategy to block TNF signaling . Although TNF blockade is already li - censed as a therapeutic strategy , its use is ham - pered by side effects . The specificity , expression , and the mouse phenotype we report implies that pharmacological disruption of the interaction be - tween iRhom2 and TACE should block specifi - cally macrophage release of TNF .
