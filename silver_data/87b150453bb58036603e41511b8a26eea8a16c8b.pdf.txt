Our aim was to elucidate the role of VIP in follicle - associated epithelium ( FAE ) and villus epithelium ( VE ) permeability following stress in rats and on human intestinal barrier func - tion . Methods Rats were injected intraperitoneally ( i . p . ) with VIP receptor - antagonists ( anti - VPACs ) , a mast cell stabilizer , doxantrazole ( DOX ) , or NaCl , and submitted to acute water avoidance stress . Ileal segments were mounted in Ussing chambers to assess 51 chromium - EDTA ( 51 Cr - EDTA ) and Escherichia ( E . ) coli ( strain K - 12 ) permeability . Rat ileal and human ileal and colonic segments were exposed to VIP (cid:1) anti - VPACs or DOX . An in vitro co - culture model of human FAE was used to study epithelial - VIP effects . VIP / VPACs distribution was assessed by microscopy . Key Results Stress increased 51 Cr - EDTA and E . coli permeability in VE and FAE . The increases were abolished by i . p . injection of DOX or anti - VPACs . Ileal VIP - exposure ex vivo increased bacterial passage and this was reduced by DOX . In human FAE ex vivo , VIP treatment doubled bacterial uptake , which was normalized by DOX or anti - VPACs . No barrier effects were observed in human colonic tissue . VPACs were found in rat and human ileal follicles , with partial mast cell co - localization . The co - culture model con - ﬁrmed VIP – mast cell – epithelial interactions in the regulation of barrier function . Conclusions & Inferences Stress affects the FAE barrier by mecha - nisms involving VIP and VPACs on mucosal mast cells . We suggest a regulatory role for VIP in the control of ileal permeability that may be relevant to bacterial – epithelial interactions in stress - related intestinal disorders .

The follicle - associated epithelium ( FAE ) is a special - ized epithelium that covers Peyer’s patches in the small intestine and contain microfold ( M ) cells that are dedicated to sampling antigens and bacteria from the lumen and transporting them to the underlying immune aggregate in the intestinal mucosa . 1 Interest - ingly , the ﬁrst observable signs of Crohn’s disease ( CD ) are often microscopic erosions in the FAE . 1 It is well known that sustained episodes of stress in life are important risk factors for the development and reacti - vation of intestinal inﬂammation . 2 – 4 We previously showed that acute and chronic stress in rats enhances particle and bacteria uptake via the FAE , 5 and recently , we veriﬁed that this is regulated by corticotropin - releasing factor ( CRF ) , substance P ( SP ) , acetylcholine Address for Correspondence Johan D S € oderholm , MD , PhD , Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine , Link € oping University , Link € oping 581 83 , Sweden .

Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ( VIP ) is a peptide hormone and a non - adrenergic , non - cholinergic neuro - transmitter found in non - cholinergic secretomotor / vasodilator neurons in the small intestine . 7 , 8 VIP - positive neurons directly innervate the epithelium and regulate ion and ﬂuid secretion 8 – 11 and have been implicated in the control of paracellular permeabil - ity . 12 – 14 In several studies , VIP has been shown to down - regulate inﬂammatory responses 14 – 16 : indeed , VIP has been proposed as an anti - inﬂammatory agent with therapeutic potential for various immune disor - ders , e . g . , CD and rheumatoid arthritis . 16 , 17 There are two known receptors for VIP : VIP receptor 1 ( VPAC1 ) and VIP receptor 2 ( VPAC2 ) . Immunoreactivity to VIP and its receptors has been described in poorly charac - terized immune cells in the Peyer’s patch and sub - epithelial dome ( SED ) of pig , mouse , and cat . 18 – 20 Studies of VIP and its receptors in relation to stress and mast cells in the intestinal mucosa are lacking ; however , VPAC2 has been found on the human mast cell line HMC - 1 21 and VIP expression has been iden - tiﬁed in porcine ureter mast cells . 22 To further map the regulation of FAE permeability , we sought to investigate the effects of VIP on FAE barrier function . The aim of this study was to assess a role for VIP in the regulation of epithelial permeability after stress in rats . As previous studies on VIP effects on mucosal function mainly were performed on murine colon , we complemented these studies with an analysis of VIP effects on human ileum and colon , as VIP might have diverse actions in different species and regions of intestine . Our results show that the stress - induced increase in bacterial uptake in FAE and regular villus epithelium ( VE ) can be prevented by blocking mast cells and VPACs . Furthermore , VIP mimicked stress - induced permeability changes in the human ileum , but not in the colon , and stabilizing the mast cells abolished these changes . These ﬁndings add to previous data on CRF , SP , ACh , and mast cells effects on FAE barrier function , and point to an important role of VIP – mast cell interactions , speciﬁ - cally in the regulation of ileal permeability . MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals Thirty - eight male Wistar rats ( B & K Universal AB , Sollentuna , Sweden ) , 150 g at arrival , were acclimatized for 1 week and then handled daily by the same person for 2 weeks prior to experi - ments . Animals were kept in pairs ( cages : 37 ( l ) 9 21 ( w ) 9 18 ( h ) cm , volume of 14 dm 3 ) in pathogen - free conditions with 12 : 12 h light : dark cycle ( 22 (cid:1) 2 ° C and 50 (cid:1) 5 % humidity ) and fed ad libitum on a diet of standard rat pellets ( R70 , Lactamin AB , Vadstena , Sweden ) and tap water . The study was approved by the ethical committee on animal experiments , Link € oping University , Sweden . Firstly , 24 rats were divided into one stress and one non - stress group . Four rats / group were intraperitoneally ( i . p . ) injected with 0 . 5 mL of 100 l g kg (cid:3) 1 of VIP 6 – 28 , a combined VPAC1 and VPAC2 antagonist ( Sigma - Aldrich , Stockholm , Sweden ) , 20 mg kg (cid:3) 1 of doxantrazole ( DOX ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , or physiolog - ical saline as controls . The dose of the VPAC antagonist was based on literature 23 , 24 and the dose of DOX was previously shown to effectively block mast cells . 25 Thirty minutes after injection , rats were submitted to 1 h of water avoidance stress ( WAS ) or left in cages ( non - stress ) , as previously described . 5 Fecal pellets were counted as an indirect index of stress - induced colonic propulsive activity . 26 Rats were anesthetized by isoﬂuran and the distal ileum ( starting 5 cm proximal to the ileocaecal valve ) was transported to the laboratory in ice - cold oxygenated Krebs buffer for permeability studies . To further investigate VIP – mast cell interactions , we examined direct effects on the intestine compared to the situation in vivo . Thus , eight rats were anesthetized and ileal segments were dissected and segments mounted in Ussing chambers and exposed to VIP and DOX as per our previous protocol . 27 Six other rats were sacriﬁced for immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . Segments from ileum were dissected , ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) for 2 h , placed in PBS with 30 % sucrose until embedded in mounting medium and cryosectioned at 10 l m . Patients Macroscopically normal specimens were taken from the terminal ileum next to the ileocaecal valve of 21 patients during surgery for colonic cancer at the University Hospital of Link € oping . From ﬁve of the 21 patients , distal colonic tissue was also obtained . The patients were nine men ( age range 73 – 90 , mean age 78 . 4 years ) and 12 women ( age range 53 – 88 , mean age 74 . 7 years ) with no generalized disease and none had received preoperative chemo - therapy or radiotherapy . The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Committee , Link € oping , Sweden and all subjects gave their informed consent . Human segments for histological analyses were dissected , ﬁxed in 4 % PFA for 2 h , and placed in PBS with 30 % sucrose until embedded in mounting medium and cryosectioned . Rat Ussing experiments The external muscle and myenteric plexus were stripped off the intestinal specimens . Sections of FAE and VE , identiﬁed macro - scopically , were mounted in Ussing chambers ( Harvard apparatus Inc . , Holliston , MA , USA ) 6 as previously described . 5 The trans - epithelial potential difference , short - circuit current ( I sc ) , and the transepithelial resistance ( TER ) across the tissues were monitored throughout the experiments . Two FAE and VE segments from each rat were mounted in chambers . 51 chromium ( Cr ) - EDTA ( Perkin Elmer , Boston , MA , USA ) was added to the mucosal side ( 34 l Ci mL (cid:3) 1 ) , and at 0 , 30 , 60 , and 90 min , serosal samples were collected and replaced with an equal volume of Krebs solution containing 10 mmol L (cid:3) 1 glucose . Two other FAE and VE segments from each rat were © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd e407 Volume 25 , Number 6 , June 2013 VIP and mast cells in ileal barrier function mounted , and chemically killed ﬂuorescein - conjugated Escheri - chia ( E . ) coli K - 12 was added at a ﬁnal concentration of 1 9 10 8 CFU mL (cid:3) 1 ( Molecular Probes , Leiden , The Nether - lands ) . 5 After 120 min , the entire volume of the serosal compart - ments was collected and analyzed at 488 nm in a ﬂuorimeter where one unit refers to 3 . 2 9 10 3 CFU mL (cid:3) 1 ( Cary Eclipse , Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . 51 Cr - EDTA passage was measured by c - counting ( 1282 Compugamma , LKB , Bromma , Sweden ) . Permeability was calculated during the 30 - to 90 - min period and results are presented as P app ( apparent permeability coefﬁcient ; cm s (cid:3) 1 9 10 (cid:3) 6 ) . 28 Tissue segments with a transepi - thelial potential difference > (cid:3) 0 . 5 mV were considered not viable and were discarded . Following Ussing experiments , tissue viabil - ity was also assessed by adding 10 l mol L (cid:3) 1 forskolin to the apical chamber , which raises levels of cyclic AMP with resultant active net ion transport in viable tissue ( as assessed by an increase in I sc ) : non - responsive tissues were discarded . Exposure to mast cell blocker and VIP Eight FAE and VE segments per rat were mounted in Ussing chambers and after 20 min , Krebs ( vehicle ) or DOX ( 10 l mol L (cid:3) 1 ) was added to the serosal side . After another 20 min , 51 Cr - EDTA or E . coli K - 12 was added to the mucosal side . To the serosal sides , either 0 . 1 l mol L (cid:3) 1 VIP ( Sigma - Aldrich ) or Krebs was added . Serosal samples were collected as described above and replaced with Krebs (cid:1) VIP (cid:1) DOX as appropriate . Human Ussing experiments Ileal segments of FAE and VE from 21 patients were mounted in Ussing chambers as previously described . 28 From ﬁve of the 21 patients , colonic segments were also mounted . Experiments were thereafter performed as for rats , except that ketotifen ( KETO ) was used instead of DOX . Ketotifen is one of the few mast cell stabilizers available for human use . It is mainly used as an antiasthmatic drug , but clinical improvement by KETO therapy has also been demonstrated in irritable bowel syndrome 29 and inﬂammatory bowel disease . 30 Segments of FAE and VE were mounted in Ussing chambers and after 20 min , Krebs or KETO ( 1 l mol L (cid:3) 1 ) was added to the serosal side . After another 20 min , 51 Cr - EDTA ( FAE ; 11 patients , VE ; 16 patients ) or E . coli K - 12 ( FAE ; 11 patients , VE ; 16 patients ) was added to the mucosal side . Follicle - associated epithelium and VE segments from ﬁve other patients were mounted in Ussing chambers and after 20 min , treated with anti - VPAC ( 1 l mol L (cid:3) 1 ) or Krebs solution and 20 min later , VIP ( 0 . 1 l mol L (cid:3) 1 ) was added and the effect on 51 Cr - EDTA and E . coli K - 12 passage was determined , as described above . In each experiment , two segments of each tissue type were mounted , and results are presented as mean from these two segments . IHC of rat tissue Sections of 4 l m from a total of six untreated rats were rinsed in PBS and incubated with 10 % H 2 O 2 in methanol for 20 min . After rinsing in PBS , slides were blocked with serum for 20 min , blocked using Avidin / Biotin blocking kit ( Vector , Burlingame , CA , USA ) , and incubated overnight at 4 ° C with primary mouse - anti - VPAC1 ( 1 : 100 ; Chemicon , Temecula , CA , USA ) , mouse - anti - VPAC2 ( 1 : 100 ; Chemicon ) , or rabbit - anti - VIP ( 1 : 500 ; Chemicon ) antibodies . Sections were rinsed and a biotinylated goat - anti - rabbit ( 1 : 200 ) or goat - anti - mouse ( 1 : 100 ) Ig antibody ( BD Pharmingen , Franklin Lakes , NJ , USA ) was added and the slides subsequently incubated for 1 h at room temperature . For visualization , the ABC method ( Vectastain (cid:1) ABC kit , Vector ) and DAB substrate kit ( Vector ) were used according to the manufac - turer’s instructions . After rinsing in water , sections were stained for mast cells with May - Gr € unvald / Giemsa . We veriﬁed mast cell staining by May - Gr € unvald / Giemsa by staining triple sections with May - Gr € unvald / Giemsa , Elastase ( neutrophils ) , and Congo Red ( eosinophils ) , respectively . 6 The same area of all three sections showed positive mast cell staining , but no staining of neutrophils or eosinophils . Sections from four control rats and four stressed rats were stained with May - Gr € unvald / Giemsa and mast cells were quanti - tated in three sections per rat . On each section , eight non - overlapping areas ( 37 l m 2 ) above the muscularis mucosa were examined . Sections on coded slides were examined in a Nikon Eclipse E800 light microscope equipped with a Nikon DS - Ri1 digital camera ( Nikon , Melville , NY , USA ) . Sections with no primary antibody were used as negative controls in all IHC experiments . IHC and ISH in serial sections of human tissue Serial sections of 4 l m were used for mast cell detection by IHC and VIP staining by ISH . Mast cell detection by IHC was performed as in rat tissue except that the primary antibody used was mouse - anti - mast cell tryptase ( 1 : 100 , Pierce , Rockford , IL , USA ) , and instead of DAB , the VIP substrate kit ( Vector ) was used . VIP staining by ISH was performed according to an established protocol 31 using the digoxigenin - hyperlabeled oligonucleotide antisense ssDNA - probe 5 ′ - actggtgaaaactccatcagc atgcctggc - 3 ′ ( Biomers , Ulm , Germany ) . Negative control was the correspond - ing VIP sense digoxigenin - hyperlabeled probe ( Biomers ) and a b - actin probe served as a positive control . Localization of mast cells and VIP expression in serial sections was evaluated on a Nikon Eclipse E800 light microscope equipped with a Nikon DS - Ri1 digital camera ( Nikon ) . IHC of VPACs and mast cells on human tissue Sections of 10 l m were air - dried , rinsed in PBS , and blocked with serum for 20 min . After rinsing , slides were incubated overnight at 4 ° C with primary mouse - anti - mast cell tryptase ( 1 : 100 ) together with goat - anti - VPAC1 or goat - anti - VPAC2 ( both at 1 : 100 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA , USA ) . Slides were rinsed and incubated with Alexa ﬂuor 488 - conjugated rabbit - anti - mouse ( 1 : 100 ; Molecular probes , Eugene , OR , USA ) or TRITC - conjugated donkey - anti - goat ( 1 : 100 ; Santa Cruz ) for 1 h at room temperature . Slides were rinsed , mounted with ProLong (cid:1) Gold with DAPI ( Invitrogen , Stockholm , Sweden ) , and evaluated in a blinded fashion by confocal laser scanning microscopy ( Zeiss LSM 700 , Carl Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) . In vitro studies of VIP effects using a co - culture model of human FAE To study the potential direct effect of VIP on human FAE , an in vitro co - culture model was used . Kerne (cid:3) ıs et al . 32 showed that co - culture of Peyer ′ s patch lymphocytes and intestinal epithelial cells can trigger epithelial cell conversion into an M cell - like phenotype . Using previously established modiﬁcations , 28 , 33 , 34 the effects of VIP on bacterial uptake could be studied . Brieﬂy , intestinal epithelial Caco - 2 - cl1 cells ( originally obtained from © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd e408 (cid:1) A . V . Keita et al . Neurogastroenterology and Motility Dr . Maria Rescigno , Milan , Italy ) were grown on Matrigel TM ( BD Pharmingen ) coated polycarbonate ﬁlters ( Costar , Baedvenhorp , The Netherlands ) with a pore size of 3 . 0 l m . The model FAE was obtained by adding 5 9 10 5 Raji B cells ( ATCC , Manasses , VA , USA ) suspended in DMEM to the basolateral chamber of 14 - to 17 - day - old Caco - 2 cell monolayers . The co - culture was then maintained for 4 – 6 days , until M cells were generated . Corre - sponding mono - cultures of Caco - 2 cells on matched ﬁlter sup - ports served as controls . Before and after transport experiments , TER was measured using a voltohmmeter ( Merck Millipore , Darmstadt , Germany ) to check cell monolayer integrity . As previously shown , 34 co - cultured Caco - 2 monolayers had ~ 10 % lower TER than controls ( 548 (cid:1) 9 vs 622 (cid:1) 16 Ω cm 2 ) . To further verify transport function in the model FAE , transcytosis of live green ﬂuorescent protein ( gfp ) - labeled Salmonella typhimurium was studied , prepared as previously described . 28 Salmonella typhimurium has been shown to translocate from the apical to the basolateral side of M cell monolayers at a signiﬁcantly higher rate than that across Caco - 2 - cl1 monolayers . 34 After 4 h , one half of the ﬁlters were processed for scanning electron microscope ( SEM ; JSM 840 , JEOL , Tokyo , Japan ) . The other half was rinsed in PBS , ﬁxed with 4 % PFA , mounted with ProLong antifade - DAPI reagent , and evaluated in a Nikon ﬂuorescence microscope . Basolateral medium containing translocated Salmonella was serially diluted , plated onto LB - agar in duplicates , grown under aerobic conditions overnight at 37 ° C , and the number of CFUs was determined . Preparation of mast cell supernatants and bacteria The mast cell line used for this study was the commercially available Rat Basophilic Leukaemia ( RBL - 2H3 ) cell line ( ATCC ) . The RBL - 2H3 celllinehas been commonly used because ofits good histamine - releasing properties . 35 , 36 Although there are advantages of the RBL - 2H3 cells , they have maintained some properties from their basophilic lineage . 37 We choose to work with this cell line because of its similarities with mucosal mast cells . Preparation of mast cell supernatants was performedby seeding 5 mL ofRBL - 2H3 at 5 9 10 5 cells mL (cid:3) 1 . Cells were left for 3 h to adhere and acclimatize . Medium was changed 1 h prior to the start of the experiment . Five different conditioned media were prepared : ( i ) medium from mast cells alone ; ( ii ) medium from mast cells stimulated with 0 . 1 l mol L (cid:3) 1 VIP for 30 min ; ( iii ) medium from mast cells stimulated with 5 l mol L (cid:3) 1 ionophore A23187 ( Sigma - Aldrich , Stockholm , Sweden ) for 30 min ; ( iv ) medium with 5 l mol L (cid:3) 1 ionophore ; and ( v ) medium with 0 . 1 l mol L (cid:3) 1 VIP . For co - culture studies , thegfp - labeled non - pathogenic strain E . coli HS was used as previously described . 28 On the day of experimentation , epithelial monolayers were washed with warm PBS and incubated for 1 h at 37 ° C in fresh DMEM without antimicrobial agents . After TER measurements , the various conditioned media were added to the basolateral chamber of the culture well ( in duplicate ) for 20 min at 37 ° C and then 1 9 10 8 CFU mL (cid:3) 1 E . coli HS were added to the apical side of the epithelium . After 4 h , TER was measured and basolateral medium was harvested as described for the co - culture study . The experiments were performed in two independent settings . Statistics Values of symmetrical distribution using Kolmogorov – Smirnov test were considered parametric and comparisons were done using Student’s t - test or using one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison post - test . Values of skew distribution using Kolmogorov – Smirnov test were analyzed using Kruskal – Wallis test followed by Mann – Whitney or with Dunn’s multiple comparison test . Differences with P < 0 . 05 were considered signiﬁcant . Parametric values are presented as mean (cid:1) SEM . Non - parametric values are presented as median (cid:1) interquartile range . Statistical calculations were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 ( GraphPad software , San Diego , CA , USA ) . RESULTS Rat studies Stress - induced increased permeability in rat ileum is inhibited by in vivo blocking of VPACs In NaCl - injected stressed animals , the defecation ratio was 9 – 11 pellets h (cid:3) 1 * as compared to 0 – 4 in non - stressed rats , 3 – 5 in rats injected with VPAC antagonist prior to stress , and 2 – 4 in rats injected with DOX prior to stress ( * P < 0 . 001 compared to all groups , n = 4 rats / group ) . In FAE , stress increased E . coli K - 12 passage and this was blocked by DOX - and anti - VPACs injections ( Fig . 1 ) . Furthermore , WAS increased I sc and decreased TER and these changes were also inhibited by DOX - and anti - VPACs ( Table 1A ) . 51 Cr - EDTA permeability was similar in stressed and non - stressed animals , and unaffected by DOX or anti - VPACs treatment ( Table 1A ) .

Exposure of ileal tissue to VIP ex vivo increased E . coli passage in VE and FAE , and these increases were abolished by pretreatment with DOX ( Fig . 2 ) . Furthermore , VIP increased I sc and 51 Cr - EDTA permeability compared to vehicle in both tissues , which were abolished by DOX ( Table 1B ) . The TER was similar in all groups ( Table 1B ) . Mast cells express VPACs and VIP Immunohisto - chemistry revealed VPAC1 on the surface of mast cells in villi adjacent to FAE and in the surrounding follicles ( Fig . 3A ) , as well as on unidentiﬁed immune cells at the follicle margins . VPAC1 immunoreactivity was observed around blood vessels within the follicles ( Fig . 3B ) and in the muscularis mucosae and muscu - laris propria . VPAC2 expression was found in the cytoplasm of immune cells inside and surrounding the follicles ( Fig . 3C ) , and on the surface of mast cells . Staining for VIP revealed immunoreactive mast cells in adjacent villi and at follicle margins ( Fig . 3D ) . Single VIP + mast cells were found inside the follicles . VIP + axons were found in close contact with smooth muscle cells of the muscularis mucosae and muscularis pro - pria , and extending toward the lumen in villi adjacent to the follicle margins ( Fig . 3E ) and underlying the FAE . There was no signiﬁcant difference in the number Figure 2 Passage of Escherichia ( E . ) coli K - 12 in rat ileal follicle - associated epithelium ( FAE ) and villus epithelium ( VE ) .

Neurogastroenterology and Motility of mast cells observed between stressed rats ( 28 (cid:1) 1 . 3 mast cells mm (cid:3) 2 , n = 4 rats ) and controls ( 24 . 7 (cid:1) 0 . 9 , n = 4 rats ) . Human intestine VIP induces mast cell - and VPAC - dependent increases in permeability in human ileum , but not in colon We next wanted to compare the results of the rat ileal ex vivo studies using an analysis of human intestinal mucosa . As KETO is used clinically and has effects on mucosal mast cells , 30 it was used as a mast cell stabilizer in studies on human mucosa . In the ileum of 16 patients , VIP exposure more than doubled E . coli uptake both in VE ( 16 patients ) and FAE ( 11 patients ; Fig . 4 ) : increases that were abolished by pretreatment with KETO ( VE = 11 patients , FAE = six patients ) . Addition of a VPAC antagonist to the tissue prior to VIP treatment decreased bacterial uptake ( ﬁve patients ) . I sc , TER , and 51 Cr - EDTA permeability were unchanged by exposure to VIP ( 21 patients ; Table 1C ) . In ﬁve patients , both ileal and colonic mucosa were obtained . The effects on E . coli passage of VIP in ileum from these ﬁve patients ( VIP 12 . 2 (cid:1) 1 . 5 units ) mirrored the data on ileum from all 16 patients ( VIP 11 . 6 (cid:1) 0 . 7 ) . In contrast , VIP ( (cid:1) KETO ) had no signiﬁcant effect on E . coli passage in colonic tissue ( Fig . 4 ) . In comparison with the ileal tissue from the 21 patients ( above ) , there were no changes in I sc , TER , or 51 Cr - EDTA permeability in ileal or colonic tissue from these ﬁve patients ( results not shown ) . Mast cells , VIP , and VPACs co - localization in human ileum and colon In the serial sections of ileal FAE from three patients , both mast cells and VIP - producing cells were observed in the lamina propria of follicle - adjacent villi and in the submucosa surrounding the follicles . VIP + cells were observed in close proximity to mast cells ( Fig . 5A – F ) .

A similar pattern of VIP expression and mast cells was observed in colonic tissues . Fluorescence IHC revealed co - localization of mast cells and VPAC1 ( Fig . 6A – C ) and VPAC2 ( Fig . 6D – F ) in human ileum and colon . Mast cell - dependent increase in E . coli HS passage and TER by VIP in cell culture Scanning electron microscope conﬁrmed the Caco - 2 cell transformation to FAE - like epithelium as shown by areas of sparse disorganized microvilli indicating an M cell - like mor - phology ( Fig . 7A ) . A greater number of translocated bacteria were seen in basolateral media from co - culture monolayers compared with Caco - 2 ( Fig . 7B ) . Fluores - cence microscopy demonstrated more translocated Salmonella in co - culture monolayers compared with control Caco - 2 monolayers ( Fig . 7C ) . In two independent experiments , conditioned med - ium from VIP - stimulated mast cells increased the trans - epithelialpassageof E . coli HSascomparedwithVIPonly or non - treated mast cell conditioned medium ( Fig . 7D ) . In Caco - 2 epithelium , VIP - stimulated mast cell super - natant induced signiﬁcantly less bacterial passage com - pared with co - culture ( Fig . 7D ) . Basolateral media from co - cultured and Caco - 2 only monolayers , without mast cell supernatant , but with VIP or ionophore added , showed no bacterial transport ( data not shown ) . In co - cultured monolayers , neither VIP ( 109 (cid:1) 2 % of initial TER ) nor ionophore ( 115 (cid:1) 2 % ) had any effect on TER compared with controls ( 114 (cid:1) 0 . 5 % ) . A similar pattern was seen in Caco - 2 monolayers ( VIP = 110 (cid:1) 0 . 5 , ionophore = 110 (cid:1) 2 , controls = 110 (cid:1) 3 % of initial TER ) . DISCUSSION Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide - containing non - cholinergic secretomotor / vasodilator neurons inner - vate the epithelium and regulate ion and ﬂuid secre - tion , and have also been implicated in the control of paracellular permeability . Vasoactive intestinal poly - peptide has , however , not previously been recognized as a modulator of mucosal function during stress . In this study , we show that the acute stress - induced increase in bacterial uptake in rat ileal mucosa was prevented by injection of a VPAC antagonist or a mast cell stabilizer . Moreover , we found in ex vivo experi - ments on human and rat ileal mucosa , respectively , that VIP exposure mimicked the stress - induced increased permeability to bacteria , suggesting a local mucosal effect of VIP . Furthermore , immunohisto - chemistry demonstrated the expression of VPACs on mast cells in ileal mucosa , VIP + nerves in close proximity to mast cells , and blocking of VPACs or mast cells preventing the local mucosal VIP effects . Taken together , these novel ﬁndings suggest a role for VIP in the stress - induced breakdown of the mucosal barrier to bacteria . Studies in rats and mice , respectively , have shown that relatively mild , but ongoing , psychological stress impairs mucin contents and epithelial defense to luminal bacteria , thereby potentially facilitating the early steps of intestinal inﬂammation . 27 , 38 The impor - tance of mast cells in these events has been demon - strated by several groups . 27 , 39 , 40 Our previous studies 5 , 6 showed that the stress - induced effects on barrier function were more pronounced in the FAE Figure 4 Transmucosal passage of Escherichia ( E . ) coli K - 12 in human ileum and colon .

Neurogastroenterology and Motility than in regular VE , which could suggest a role for increased antigen exposure in the Peyer’s patches in the initiation of pro - inﬂammatory responses during stress . In addition , use of a co - culture model of FAE showing increased bacterial passage evoked by condi - tioned medium from VIP - stimulated mast cells , but not by VIP alone , conﬁrmed an interaction between VIP and mast cells in the regulation of FAE perme - ability . Previously recognized mucosal stress media - tors acting via mast cells , e . g . , CRF and ACh , have similar effects in the ileum and colon , 27 , 41 whereas the data herein reveal that VIP - induced increases in permeability , at least as determined by Ussing cham - ber analysis , are present in the human ileum , but not in the colon . This suggests a speciﬁc role for VIP in the pathogenesis of stress - induced intestinal disor - ders , and makes further scientiﬁc investigation in this ﬁeld warranted . The close interaction of VIP and mast cells was corroborated by IHC .

In this study , we found frequent expression of VPAC1 and VPAC2 on mast cells in both rat and human FAE tissue . Furthermore , VIP immunoreactivity was found in mast cells in rat and human FAE . In humans , VIP - immunoreactive cells were also commonly observed in close proximity to mast cells whose VPACs expression would allow them to respond to VIP . On the other hand , previous studies 8 have described secretomotor neurons releasing VIP at mucosal neuroepithelial junctions , which would suggest that VIP may have effects on epithelial function without working through mast cell activation . Very little has been reported on VIP involvement in stress - induced gut permeability changes . In an in vitro co - culture model of human submucosal neurons and human polarized colonic monolayers , decreased pas - sage of 4 kDa FITC dextran , a paracellular probe , was found after electrical stimulation of submucosal neu - rons , which was reproduced by a VIP peptide . 12 Inter - estingly , the effect of neuron activation was blocked by anti - VPAC and the neurotoxin TTX . This study did not include mast cells , whereas our in vitro co - culture experiments demonstrate the requirement of mast cells for the effect of VIP to manifest . Our ex vivo experiments showed a slightly increased paracellular 51 Cr - EDTA passage during VIP exposure in rat mucosa , while TER was unchanged . In contrast , rats given anti - VPACs in vivo showed an increased TER , but unchanged paracellular 51 Cr - EDTA passage . These ﬁnd - ings suggest differential regulation of permeability to macromolecules and ions , as previously described for myosin light chain kinase activation and IL - 13 - depen - dent claudin - 2 expression , respectively . 43 In human intestine , VIP had no effect on paracellular permeabil - ity , whereas unpublished data from our laboratory show that in vivo stress in healthy volunteers results in increased paracellular permeability . Collectively , these data point to various mechanisms in the regula - tion of paracellular permeability in vivo and ex vivo , and further illustrate the diverse actions of VIP . However , considering bacterial transport as a principal A B C D E F Figure 6 Immunoﬂuorescence of mast cell tryptase ( MCT ) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptors ( VPACs ) in villus epithelium ( VE ) , follicle - associated epithelium ( FAE ) , and colon epithelium .

V . Keita et al . Neurogastroenterology and Motility measure of permeability after in vivo stress , ex vivo exposure to VIP , and in vitro in the co - culture model , all clearly showed a VIP - induced increased transepi - thelial passage of E . coli , which was blocked by anti - VPACs in both rat and human ileum . This suggests that VIP may mainly affect the transcellular route , as we previously showed that E . coli K - 12 is internalized via an actin - mediated mechanism . 28 It is evident that VIP is a neuropeptide with multiple complex functions . Some reports show an anti - inﬂam - matory role , 44 , 45 whereas others have shown that VIP can exert a pro - inﬂammatory inﬂuence . 46 , 47 Recently , systemic administration of VIP was shown to protect against colonic barrier dysfunction in Citrobacter rodentium - induced colitis in mice . 14 In another study , VIP enhanced the development of inﬂammation - induc - ing Th17 cells in response to antigen 46 and increased IL - 8 secretion in human HT - 29 cells . 47 In contrast , VIP decreased IL - 8 production in monocytes activated by inﬂammatory stimuli . 48 Conﬂicting results have also been reported in the ability of VIP to affect TNBS - induced colitis in mice . 16 , 49 Obviously , the effects of VIP vary according to target cell type and environmen - tal conditions and so any VIP effect is likely contex - tual , such that under diverse conditions — e . g . , infection compared to stress — VIP could mediate wildly different effects . Such a situation is not unprec - edented : for example , serotonin ( 5 - HT ) signaling is equally diverse and context - speciﬁc . 50 Our present ﬁndings from human mucosa , complemented with the in vitro co - culture studies , demonstrate discrepan - cies from VIP effects in previous studies using various mouse models . As discussed above , there are some differences between VIP effects in rat and human mucosa in this study , whereas our main ﬁnding of increased bacterial uptake in ileal mucosa and FAE was consistent in all models . This underscores the need to validate ﬁndings from murine and rodent experiments A D B C Figure 7 Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ( VIP ) effects in the co - culture model .

Photographs show typical ﬁndings in two independent experimental setups . © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd e415 Volume 25 , Number 6 , June 2013 VIP and mast cells in ileal barrier function with studies in human systems . Moreover , the data herein further corroborate the diversity of VIP effects by demonstrating its important role in human ileal permeability , while having no effect in human colonic mucosa . In conclusion , our novel ﬁndings highlight the importance of VIP – mast cell interaction in Peyer’s patches during stress and suggest a modulatory role for VIPergic pathways in the regulation of the human ileal barrier function . Our results may , thereby , be of importance for understanding the pathogenesis of stress - related intestinal disorders , and give clues to new therapeutic approaches .
