We investigated the in vivo function of Src family kinases ( SFKs ) as growth cone guidance signaling intermediates in the context of spinal lateral motor column ( LMC ) motor axon projection toward the ventral or dorsal limb mesenchyme . Using in situ mRNA detection we determined that Src and Fyn are expressed in LMC motor neurons of chick and mouse embryos at the time of limb trajectory selection .

In summary , our findings demonstrate that SFKs are essential for motor axon guidance and suggest that they play an important role in relaying ephrin : Eph signals that mediate the selection of motor axon trajectory in the limb . Introduction In the developing nervous system , axons are guided by signals transmitted to the cytoskeleton through guidance receptors . Src family kinases ( SFKs ) have been proposed to function in this process ( Sasaki et al . , 2002 ; Liu et al . , 2007 ) prompting us to investigate their role in the axon guidance decision executed by motor axons upon limb mesenchyme entry . SFKs are nonreceptor kinases containing the Src homology ( SH ) 1 domain containing the catalytic tyrosine kinase domain and a regulatory domain . SH2 and SH3 domains function in SFK target recognition and binding ( Martin , 2001 ) . SFK activity is inhibited by phosphorylation by the C - terminal Src kinase ( Csk ) ( Klages et al . , 1994 ) . Four SFK members , Src , Fyn , Yes , and Lyn are expressed in the CNS ( Thomas and Brugge , 1997 ) and medi - ate differentiation , axon outgrowth , fasciculation , and guidance ( Kuo et al . , 1997 ; Morse et al . , 1998 ; Hoffman - Kim et al . , 2002 ; Robles et al . , 2005 ) . The evidence for SFK function in axon guid - ancestemsfrominvertebratestudiesdemonstratingSFKinvolve - ment in Wnt5 / derailed - mediated axon repulsion in Drosophila and netrin / UNC - 5 - mediated growth cone guidance in C . elegans ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Wouda et al . , 2008 ) . In addition to Netrin signaling , SFKs have been proposed to mediate ephrin - A : EphA - mediated axon guidance in vertebrates , possibly through effec - tors such as ephexin and Nck ( Kno¨ll and Drescher , 2004 ; Meriane et al . , 2004 ; Fawcett et al . , 2007 ; Yue et al . , 2008 ) . However , our complete understanding of SFKs’ function in axon guidance is hindered by their functional redundancy ( Stein et al . , 1994 ) and few accessible in vivo axon guidance decisions in which SFKs’ role can be assayed with precision . One relatively simple system suited for the study of axon guid - ance signaling is composed by spinal motor axon trajectories in the limb . Limb - innervating lateral motor column ( LMC ) neu - rons are divided into medial and lateral divisions , invariantly innervating ventral and dorsal limb muscles , respectively ( Land - messer , 1978 ; Lance - Jones and Landmesser , 1981 ; Luria and Laufer , 2007 ) . The LIM homeodomain transcription factors Isl1 in medial and Lim1 in lateral LMC neurons promote , respec - tively , tyrosine kinase receptor EphB1 and EphA4 expression . Their cognate ligands , ephrin - B2 and ephrin - A5 , are expressed in the dorsal and ventral limb , and repulsive ephrin : Eph interac - tions have been proposed to result in the selection of appropriate limb nerve trajectory ( Tsuchida et al . , 1994 ; Helmbacher et al . , 2000 ; Eberhart et al . , 2002 ; Kania and Jessell , 2003 ; Luria et al . , 2008 ) . This simple choice executed by LMC axons is an ideal in vivo system in which to functionally dissect the molecular cascade relaying axon guidance receptor signaling . Here we show that Src and Fyn are expressed in LMC neurons and SFK activity inhibition by Csk over - expression or Src muta - tion perturbs LMC axon trajectory selection .

Materials and Methods Chick and mouse embryo preparations . Fertilized chick eggs ( Couvoir Simetin ) werestoredforamaximumof1weekat18°C , incubatedat38°C and staged according to standard protocols ( Hamburger and Hamilton , 1951 ) . The genotype of mouse embryos was determined as described ( Sorianoetal . , 1991 ) . Inbrief , tailsofmousee12 . 5embryosweredigested with100 (cid:1) g / mlproteinaseKinSDStailbuffer ( 100m M TrispH8 . 5 , 5m M EDTA , 200 m M NaCl , 0 . 2 % SDS ) at 55°C overnight . The extracted DNA was precipitated by isopropanol , washed with 70 % ethanol , and resus - pendedinddH 2 O . PCRwasperformedusingQiagenMasterMixandthe following primers : common primer ( 5 (cid:1) - AGCAACAAGAGCAAG - CCCAAGGAC - 3 (cid:1) ) , Src ( 5 (cid:1) - TCATAGCCGAATAGCCTCTCCAC - 3 (cid:1) ) , and WT ( 5 (cid:1) - GTGACGGTGTCCGAGGAGTTGAAG - 3 (cid:1) ) . PCR products were then visualized on a 2 % agarose gel after gel electrophoresis ( Src (cid:2) / (cid:2) (cid:3) 200 bp , Src (cid:4) / (cid:4) (cid:3) 450 bp , Src (cid:2) / (cid:4) (cid:3) both 200 bp and 450 bp ) . Molecular biology . The Csk expression plasmid was generated by BsrGI digestion of Csk : : GFP ( Kno¨ll and Drescher , 2004 ) and subcloning of the 1 . 8 kb fragment into the Asp718 site of pCAGGS / SE . The e [ Isl1 ] : : GFP plasmid was generated by insertion of a 0 . 65 kb Eco RI fragment of zCrest2 - pIsl1 - PLAP containing the enhancer of Isl1 ( e [ Isl1 ] ) ( Uemura et al . , 2005 ) into pBluescript ( Invitrogen ) . The 0 . 7 kb Sal I - Not I fragment of pBS : : e [ Isl1 ] was subcloned into the Xba I site of pTATAGFP ( Lee et al . , 2004 ) . The characterization of other expression constructs , including EphA4 : : GFP , EphA4 , EphA4Y602E , EphB2 : : GFP , SrcY527F , and SrcDN , has been described ( Erpel et al . , 1995 ; Kania and Jessell , 2003 ; Zhou et al . , 2007 ) . In situ hybridization cRNA probes were obtained as follows : target sequences amplification primers were designed using Primer3 V . 0 . 4 . 0 software ( Rozen and Skaletsky , 2000 ) and the probe size was set at 600 – 800bp . One - stepRT - PCRwasperformed ( Qiagen ) usingdesignedprim - ers containing T7 polymerase promoters ( Invitrogen ) to make and am - plify cDNA template from chick HH st . 25 / 26 or mouse e11 . 5 pooled brain RNA . The PCR product was purified by gel electrophoresis in 1 % agarosegelandgelextractionusingQIAquickgelextractionkit ( Qiagen ) . The purified DNA was then reamplified by PCR . The yield of DNA was estimated by the Low DNA Mass Ladder ( Invitrogen ) after gel electro - phoresis . DIG - labeled RNA probes were synthesized by in vitro tran - scription with T7 RNA polymerase using DIG RNA labeling kit ( Roche ) . All probes were verified by sequencing . The source of sequence and the recognized region for each probe are described as follows : chick Src ( NM _ 205425 , 450 – 1150 ) , chick Fyn ( NM _ 205349 , 942 – 1636 ) , chick Yes ( NM _ 205301 , 246 – 912 ) , chick Lyn ( NM _ 001006390 , 775 – 1428 ) , chick Csk ( Sabe et al . , 1992 , 450 – 1150 ) , mouse Src ( NM _ 009271 , 728 – 1463 ) , mouse Fyn ( NM _ 008054 , 333 – 1087 ) , mouse Yes ( NM _ 009535 , 690 – 1474 ) , mouse Lyn ( NM _ 010747 , 623 – 1307 ) , mouse Csk ( Klages et al . , 1994 , 173 – 815 ) . The details of Isl1 and Lim1 probes have been described previously ( Tsuchida et al . , 1994 ) . Chick in ovo electroporation . Chick spinal cord electroporation of ex - pression plasmids was performed at HH st . 18 / 19 , generally as described ( Momoseetal . , 1999 ; Luriaetal . , 2008 ) . Inbrief , a5 – 10 (cid:1) g / (cid:1) lsolutionof plasmid DNA in TE buffer pH 7 . 5 [ 10 m M Tris - Cl ( Fisher Scientific ) and 1 m M EDTA ( Invitrogen ) ] was injected into the lumbar neural tube through a small eggshell window under a Discovery V12 stereomicro - scope ( Zeiss ) . Lower bodies of chick embryos were then electroporated with platinum / iridium electrodes ( FHC ) and the TSS20 Ovodyne elec - troporator ( Intracel ; settings : 30 V , 5 pulses 50 ms wide in a 1 s interval ) . Shell windows were sealed with Parafilm ( Pechiney Plastic Packaging Company ) and incubated at 38°C until harvesting at HH st . 28 / 29 . The efficiency of electroporation varied between 5 and 30 % of total LMC neurons electroporated depending on the construct and DNA concen - tration used . When the Csk expression plasmid was coelectroporated with other plasmids , its concentration was at least three times that of other plasmids to ensure high efficiency of coexpression . SrcY527F , SrcDN , EphA4 , or EphA4Y602E expression plasmids were coelectropo - rated with GFP at a 3 : 1 weight ratio . HRP retrograde labeling of motor neurons . Retrograde labeling of chick and mouse motor neurons was performed as described ( Luria et al . , 2008 ) . In brief , chick HH st . 28 / 29 embryos were harvested and incu - batedinTyrode’ssolution ( 139m M NaCl , 3m M KCl , 17m M NaHCO 3 , 12 m M glucose , 12 m M CaCl 2 , 1 m M MgCl 2 ; Fisher Scientific ) at room tem - perature ( RT ) and aerated with 95 % air and 5 % CO 2 . The retrograde tracer used was a 20 % solution of HRP ( Roche ) made by dissolving 100 mg of HRP in 450 (cid:1) l of PBS ( 137 m M NaCl , 2 . 7 m M KCl , 4 . 3 m M Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 . 47m M KH 2 PO 4 ) with50 (cid:1) lof10 % lysophosphatidylcholine ( Fluka ) in PBS . The HRP solution was injected into either dorsal or ventral hindlimb shank musculature of chick embryos . For mouse retro - grade labeling , e12 . 5 embryos were dissected at thoracic level and incu - bated in aerated DMEM / F12 medium ( Invitrogen ) at RT . The HRP so - lution ( as above ) was injected into either dorsal or ventral forelimb proximal muscle group and embryos were incubated at 32°C under an infrared lamp and aerated with 95 % air and 5 % CO 2 . Fresh media were added every 30 min for 5 h . In situ mRNA detection and immunostaining . Chick and mouse em - bryos were fixed in a 4 % solution of paraformaldehyde ( Sigma ) in PBS , equilibrated with 30 % sucrose in PBS , embedded in O . C . T . ( Sakura Fi - netek ) , and stored at (cid:4) 80°C . Twelve micrometer sections were collected using a Leica cryostat microtome . In situ mRNA detection was performed as described ( Schaeren - Wiemers and Gerfin - Moser , 1993 ; Kania and Jessell , 2003 ) . In brief , tissuesectionswerefirstfixedin4 % solutionofparaformaldehydeinPBS for 10 min at RT , washed three times with PBS for 5 min , and digested in Proteinase K solution [ 1 (cid:1) g / ml Proteinase K ( Roche ) in 6 . 25 m M EDTA pH 8 . 0 ( Invitrogen ) and 50 m M Tris pH 7 . 5 ( Fisher Scientific ) ] . Samples were acetylated for 10 min by immersion in a mixture of 6 ml of trieth - anolamine ( Sigma ) , 500 ml of double - distilled H 2 O and 1 . 30 ml of acetic anhydride ( Sigma ) . After PBS washes , samples were incubated with hy - bridizationbuffer [ 50 % formamide , 5 (cid:5) SSC ( 20 (cid:5) SSCis3 M NaCl , 0 . 3 M NaAc ) , 5 (cid:5) Denhardt’s ( Sigma ) and 500 (cid:1) g / ml Salmon sperm DNA ( Roche ) ] for 2 h at RT followed by incubation overnight at 72°C with DIG - labeled RNA probes ( see above ) in the hybridization buffer at a concentration of 2 – 5 ng / (cid:1) l . After hybridization , samples were immersed in 5 (cid:5) SSC at 72°C , followed by two washes in 0 . 2 (cid:5) SSC at 72°C for 45 mineachand0 . 2 (cid:5) SSCatRTfor5min . TissueswerethenrinsedwithB1 buffer [ 0 . 1 M Tris pH 7 . 5 and 0 . 15 M NaCl ( Fisher Scientific ) ] for 5 min , blocked with B2 buffer ( 10 % heat inactivated horse serum in B1 ) for 1 h at RT , and incubated with anti - DIG antibody ( 1 : 5000 in B2 , Roche ) overnightat4°C . SampleswerethenrinsedwithB1andequilibratedwith B3 buffer [ 0 . 1 M Tris pH 9 . 5 , 0 . 1 M NaCl , 0 . 05 M MgCl 2 ( Fisher Scien - tific ) ] . To detect bound anti - DIG antibodies , samples were incubated with B4 buffer [ 100 mg / Ml NBT , 50 mg / Ml BCIP ( Roche ) and 400 m M Levamisol ( Sigma ) in B3 ] in the dark . The reaction was stopped by im - mersion in H 2 O . For immunostaining , sectioned tissue was first washed in PBS , incu - bated in blocking solution [ 1 % heat inactivated horse serum in 0 . 1 % Triton - X / PBS ( Sigma ) ] for 5 min , followed by incubation overnight at 4°C in selected primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution .

Results Src and Fyn expression in LMC neurons To examine SFK function in motor axon guidance , we first de - termined whether Src , Fyn , Yes , and Lyn are expressed in LMC at the time of axon growth into the limb mesenchyme which occurs between Hamburger - Hamilton stage ( HH st . ) 25 and 27 in chick and between the embryonic day ( e ) 10 . 5 and e 11 . 5 in mouse ( Hamburger and Hamilton , 1951 ; Tosney and Landmesser , 1985 ; Kania et al . , 2000 ) . Thus , we surveyed SFK expression in the lumbar spinal cord of HH st . 25 / 26 chick embryos and both brachial / cervical and lumbar spinal cord of e11 . 5 mouse em - bryos . LMC neurons were identified by the expression of the medial LMC neuron marker , Isl1 , and the lateral LMC neuron marker , Lim1 ( Fig . 1 A , B , F , G ; supplemental Fig . S1 , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental material ) . Src and Fyn mRNA were found to be highly expressed in both medial and lateral LMC motor neurons in chick and mouse embryos ( Fig . 1 C , D , H , I ; supplemental Fig . S4 , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplementalmaterial ) . Inaddition , wealsodetectedtheexpression of Src protein in LMC neurons ( supplemental Fig . S5 , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental material ) . No obvious differ - ence of Src and Fyn expression levels was observed between medial and lateral LMC in chick and mouse and between the brachial and the lumbar spinal cord of mouse embryos ( Fig . 1 ; supplemental Fig . S1 , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental mate - rial ) . The expression of the other two SFK members , Yes and Lyn , was not detected in neither chick nor mouse LMC neurons ( sup - plemental Fig . S1 , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental material ) . To determine whether Csk , the endogenous inhibitor of SFKs , might participate in regulation of Src and Fyn activity in LMC neurons we also examined the spinal cord expression profile of Csk mRNA . We observed a strong expression of Csk in both medial and lateral LMC neurons at the lumbar level of chick HH st . 25 / 26 spinal cord ( Fig . 1 E ) . Csk mRNA was also expressed in LMC neurons at both brachial and lumbar levels of mouse e11 . 5 spinal cord ( Fig . 1 J ; supplemental Fig . S1 , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental material ) . No obvious difference in Csk expression levels was observed between medial and lateral LMC in chick and mouse and between the brachial and the lum - bar spinal cord of mouse embryos ( Fig . 1 E , J ; supplemental Fig . S1 , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental material ; data not shown ) . These results demonstrate that Src , Fyn and their inhibitor Csk are coexpressed by LMC neurons at the time of motor axon entry into the limb mesenchyme . Csk - mediated SFK inhibition results in aberrant LMC axon trajectory choice The expression of Src and Fyn in LMC neurons suggests that these genes may function in the selection of limb mesenchyme trajec - tory by LMC axons . To test this idea , we inhibited Src and Fyn function by over - expression of a GFP - tagged Csk isoform from an expression plasmid ( Csk : : GFP ) in LMC neurons at the time of their entry into the limb mesenchyme . Previous studies have con - firmed the high efficiency of the Csk : : GFP fusion protein in SFK activity inhibition ( Kno¨ll and Drescher , 2004 ) . To examine the consequences of SFK function block on LMC axon guidance , we used in ovo electroporation to introduce Csk : : GFP into lumbar LMCneuronsofHHst . 18 / 19chickembryos , beforemotoraxons have entered the hindlimb mesenchyme , and examined GFP (cid:2) motor axons in dorsal and ventral nerve branches at HH st . 28 / 29 ( Kania and Jessell , 2003 ) . Over - expression of Csk : : GFP did not change the number of neurons expressing the LMC marker FoxP1 nor did it change the proportions of lateral ( FoxP1 (cid:2) , Figure 1 .

S2 , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental material ; 51 % vs 49 % for medial and 49 % vs 51 % for lateral LMC neurons ; Student’s t test , p (cid:3) 0 . 540 ) . Quantifica - tion of GFP (cid:2) LMC neurons also indicated nearly equal propor - tions of Csk : : GFP expression in both LMC divisions compared with controls ( supplemental Fig . S2 , available at www . jneuro - sci . org as supplemental material ; 54 % for medial and 46 % for lateral LMC neurons ; Student’s t test , p (cid:3) 0 . 895 ) . In addition , the expression of EphA4 in LMC neurons and their axons and the expression of EphB1 in LMC axons were not affected by Csk : : GFP over - expression , and LMC axons entered the dorsal and ventral limb nerves on schedule ( supplemental Fig . S2 , available at ww - w . jneurosci . org as supplemental material ; data not shown ) . To determine whether blocking SFK function affected the choice of limb trajectory , we quantified the proportions of GFP (cid:2) axons in the dorsal and ventral divisional limb nerve branches by integrating fluorescence intensities of a series of hindlimb section images in multiple embryos for each experimental condition ( Kania and Jessell , 2003 ; Luria et al . , 2008 ; see Materials and Methods for detail ) . In embryos electroporated with control GFP expression plasmid , 47 % of GFP (cid:2) axons were detected in the dorsal and 53 % in the ventral nerve branches , and the ratio of GFP (cid:2) axons between ventral and dorsal branches ( v / d ratio ) was 1 . 1 ( Fig . 2 A – C ) . In embryos electroporated with Csk : : GFP , sig - nificantly higher proportions of GFP (cid:2) axons were observed in the dorsal nerve branches when compared with control embryos : 68 % of the GFP (cid:2) axons were detected in the dorsal and 32 % in the ventral branches , and the v / d ratio decreased to 0 . 5 ( Fig . 2 D – F ; Student’s t test , p (cid:6) 0 . 001 ) . These findings suggest that SFK inhibition by Csk causes a significantly greater proportion of LMC motor axons to enter the dorsal limb . Two possible scenarios could explain the increased propor - tion of LMC neurons projecting into the dorsal nerve branch when SFK function is inhibited : some me - dial LMC axons might enter the dorsal limb nerve , or both medial and lateral LMC axons inappropriately project into both limb nerves but with a greater pro - portion of medial LMC axons projecting into the dorsal limb nerve . In either case , we expected a loss of fidelity of medial LMC trajectory selection caused by SFK inhibition . To determine whether the Csk - mediated inhibition of SFKs results in re - direction of medial LMC axons into the dorsal limb mesenchyme , we coelectropo - rated an untagged Csk expression plasmid with the e [ Isl1 ] : : GFP promoter fusion plasmid , which specifically labels medial LMC motor neurons and their axons ( supplemental Fig . S3 , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental material , detailed characterization of e [ Isl1 ] : : GFP ) , and as controls , the e [ Isl1 ] : : GFP plasmid . In embryos electroporated with e [ Isl1 ] : : GFP , GFP alone or Csk and e [ Isl ] : : GFP , the number of medial or lateral LMC neurons were not significantly changed when com - pared with embryos electroporated with the GFP expression plasmid ( supplemen - tal Fig . S3 , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental material ) . We then assessed the proportions of LMC axons projecting in dorsal and ventral nerves : in e [ Isl1 ] : : GFP electroporated embryos , 90 % of GFP (cid:2) axons were detected in the ventral nerve branches and the v / d ratio was 9 . 0 ( Fig . 3 A – C ) . As in controls , GFP expression was strongly biased to medial LMC neurons in embryos coelectroporated with Csk and e [ Isl ] : : GFP ( supplemental Fig . S3 , available at www . jneuro - sci . org as supplemental material ; 89 % for GFP (cid:2) medial and 11 % for GFP (cid:2) lateral LMC neurons ; Student’s t test , p (cid:6) 0 . 001 vs GFP controls ) . However , in the limb , 44 % of GFP (cid:2) axons were ob - served in the dorsal divisional nerve branches and 56 % in the ventral nerve branches ( Fig . 3 D – F ; a v / d ratio of 1 . 3 ) . This ratio was significantly different from e [ Isl1 ] : : GFP electroporated con - trol embryos ( Fig . 3 A – C ; Student’s t test , p (cid:6) 0 . 001 ) indicating that SFK inhibition by Csk results in apparent randomization of the limb trajectory choice made by medial LMC axons . Asymmetric SFK inhibition sensitivity of the LMC trajectory choice The GFP (cid:2) axon counting experiments do not allow us to compare the extent to which both medial and lateral divisions are sensitive to SFKlossoffunction . TodeterminewhetherSFKfunctionisrequired for the selection of appropriate lateral LMC axon trajectory , we ret - rogradely labeled LMC neurons by HRP tracer injection into the ventral shank muscles of HH st . 28 / 29 embryos in which LMC neu - ronswereelectroporatedwith Csk : : GFP or GFP expressionplasmids . We determined the divisional identity of labeled LMC neurons by their Isl1 and Lim1 expression status . In GFP expressing embryos , 6 % of electroporated HRP (cid:2) LMC neurons were lateral LMC ( Lim1 (cid:2) ) neurons , reflecting occasional pathfinding errors made by LMCl neurons and experimental error ( Kania and Jessell , 2003 ; Lu - ria and Laufer , 2007 ; Luria et al . , 2008 ) . In contrast , in Csk : : GFP electroporated embryos , lateral LMC ( Lim1 (cid:2) ) neurons made up a significantly higher proportion of electroporated HRP (cid:2) LMC neu - rons ( 17 % ) ( Fig . 4 I – P ; Student’s t test , p (cid:6) 0 . 05 ) indicatingthatSFK Figure 2 .

Neurosci . , April29 , 2009 • 29 ( 17 ) : 5690 – 5700 • 5693 inhibition leads to a loss of fidelity of lateral LMC axon trajectory selection . To directly compare the effect of SFK inhibition on lateral LMC axon trajectory selection to medial LMC axon trajectory selection , we also retrogradely labeled LMC neurons by HRP injection into dorsal shank muscles of HH st . 28 / 29 embryos in which LMC neurons expressed Csk : : GFP or GFP . Our analysis of axon trajectory selection by GFP (cid:2) axon quantification suggests that whenSFKactivityisinhibited , thedorsoven - tral limb trajectory selection by medial LMC axon projections is apparently randomized resultingin50 % ofmedialLMCaxons ( 53 % of total LMC axons ) , or 26 . 5 % ( 53 % / 2 ) of total LMC axons , projecting into the dorsal limb . Thus , we expected that if medial LMC axons in which the SFK activity is inhibited select a dorsoventral limb nerve at random , 36 % [ 26 . 5 % / ( 47 % (cid:2) 26 . 5 % ) ] of LMC neu - rons labeled by dorsal limb HRP injections would be medial LMC neurons . Indeed , in embryos electroporated with Csk : : GFP and with HRP injected into dorsal shank mus - cles , 33 % of HRP (cid:2) electroporated LMC neurons were medial LMC ( Isl1 (cid:2) ) neurons , which was a significantly higher proportion thanthatdetectedin GFP electroporatedcontrolembryos ( 8 % ) ( Fig . 4 A – H ; Student’s t test , p (cid:6) 0 . 001 ) . These observations confirm that SFKinhibitionresultsinalossoffidelityoflimbtrajectorychoicebyLMCaxons , and that medial LMC axons rely on SFK activity to a greater extent than lateral LMC axons . Limited redundancy of SFK function in mouse LMC axon trajectory selection To determine the degree of SFK functional redundancy in LMC neurons in the selection of appropriate limb trajectory , we examined the LMC axon trajectory in Src mutant mice ( supplemental Fig . S4 , available at www . jneurosci . org as sup - plemental material ; Soriano et al . , 1991 ) . The specification and survival of LMC motor neurons , expression of EphA4 protein in lateral LMC neurons and EphB1 mRNA in medial LMC neurons , as well as the timing of axon outgrowth were normal in Src (cid:4) / (cid:4) mice compared with wild type littermates ( supplemental Fig . S4 , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental material ; data not shown ) . To trace the trajectory of LMC axons , we injected HRP into the dorsal or ventral forelimb proximal muscle group , which is still not developed into distinct muscles at this stage ( Kania et al . , 2000 ) , of e12 . 5 Src (cid:4) / (cid:4) and wild type littermate embryos and quantified the proportions of tracer - filled LMC neurons that ex - pressed Isl1 and Lim1 . In dorsally filled Src (cid:4) / (cid:4) embryos , 36 % of HRP labeled LMC neurons were medial LMC ( Isl1 (cid:2) ) neurons , compared with 5 % labeled in control embryos ( Fig . 5 A – F ; Stu - dent’s t test , p (cid:6) 0 . 001 ) . Inventrallyfilled Src (cid:4) / (cid:4) embryos , 15 % of HRP labeled LMC neurons were lateral LMC ( Lim1 (cid:2) ) neurons , compared with 4 % labeled in control embryos ( Fig . 5 G – L ; Stu - dent’s t test , p (cid:6) 0 . 05 ) . These findings demonstrate that Src func - tion is required for the selection of appropriate LMC axon trajec - tory and that the dependence on Src function is different between medial and lateral LMC neurons . Gain and loss of Src function affects LMC axon trajectory selection in chick To further characterize the role of Src in LMC axon projection , we examined the effect of Src gain and loss of function on LMC axon trajectory selection in chick . To do this , we used a plasmid encoding the constitutively active Src mutant , SrcY527F , where the Csk binding site at the regulatory C - terminal tyrosine residue is mutated ( Y527F ; Erpel et al . , 1995 ) , and a plasmid encoding the dominant negative mutant of Src , SrcDN , containing the Y527F mutation and a kinase domain catalytic site mutation ( K295M ; Cursi et al . , 2006 ) . The SrcDN double point mutation is a more efficient inhibitor of Src activity than SrcK295M alone because this mutant can interact with its normal target proteins through SH2 and SH3 domains but is devoid of enzymatic activities and thus competes with endogenous activated SFKs ( Fresno Vara et al . , 2001 ; Destaing et al . , 2008 ) . We coelectroporated the SrcY527F or SrcDN expression plas - mids with a GFP expression plasmid , or as controls , GFP plasmid alone , in the presumptive lumbar spinal cord at HH st . 18 / 19 and analyzed LMC cell fate specification and limb axon pathway se - lection at HH st . 28 / 29 . The specification and survival of LMC motor neurons were not altered after SrcY527F or SrcDN over - expression compared with GFP electroporated controls ( supple - mental Fig . S5 , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental material ) . In addition , the divisional identity of electroporated LMC motor neurons suggested nearly equal proportions of SrcY527F or SrcDN expression in both lateral and medial LMC neurons compared with controls ( supplemental Fig . S5 , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental material ) . We next ana - lyzed the proportions of GFP (cid:2) axons within the dorsal and the ventral limb nerves . In embryos coelectroporated with SrcY527F and GFP expression plasmids , a significantly greater proportion of GFP (cid:2) axons were observed in the ventral limb nerves com - pared with control embryos : 39 % of GFP (cid:2) axons were detected in the dorsal and 61 % in the ventral branches ( a v / d ratio of 1 . 6 ) Figure 3 .

These observa - tions indicate that blocking Src activity di - rects more LMC axons into the dorsal limb nerve , consistent with the altered limb axon trajectory selection by LMC axons overexpressing Csk orlacking Src function , and increasing the level of Src activity re - sults in redirection of LMC axons into the ventral limb nerve . SFK function is required for Eph signaling - induced LMC motor axon redirection SFKs have been suggested as downstream effectors of Eph signaling in several con - texts ( Kno¨ll and Drescher , 2004 ; Zimmer et al . , 2007 ) . Also , ephrin : Eph signaling is sufficient to redirect LMC axons : over - expression of EphA4 in LMC axons results in almost all of them projecting into the dorsal limb nerve ( Kania and Jessell , 2003 ; Luria et al . , 2008 ) . To examine whether SFKs might play a role in Eph signal trans - duction during LMC motor axon path - finding , we coelectroporated the Eph receptor - GFP fusion protein expression plasmids EphB2 : : GFP or EphA4 : : GFP with Csk expression plasmids and compared with control EphB2 : : GFP or EphA4 : : GFP plasmid electroporations . The in ovo elec - troporations were performed in the pre - sumptive lumbar spinal cord at HH st . 18 / 19 and analyzed at HH st . 28 / 29 . In control embryos electroporated with EphB2 : : GFP alone , a higher fraction of GFP (cid:2) axons was observed in ventral LMC axons when compared with GFP alone controls : 35 % of GFP (cid:2) axons were detected in thedorsaland65 % intheventrallimbnerves , demonstratingthat EphB2 over - expression is sufficient to redirect LMC axons into the ventral limb ( Figs . 6 A – C , A – C ; a v / d ratio of 1 . 9 ; Student’s t test , p (cid:6) 0 . 001 vs GFP controls ) . In embryos coelectroporated with Csk and EphB2 : : GFP , significant higher proportions of GFP levels were observed in dorsal nerve branches compared with EphB2 : : GFP alone : 52 % of GFP (cid:2) axons in the dorsal and 48 % in the ventral branches , and the v / d ratio decreased to 0 . 9 ( Fig . 7 D – F ; Student’s t test , p (cid:6) 0 . 001 vs EphB2 : : GFP ) . This result indi - cates that inhibition of SFK function attenuates EphB2 - induced LMC motor axon redirection . EphA4 : : GFP over - expression in control embryos , as previ - ously demonstrated ( Eberhart et al . , 2002 ; Kania and Jessell , 2003 ) , induced a robust redirection of LMC axons into the dorsal limbnerves : 91 % ofGFP (cid:2) axonsweredetectedindorsalandonly 9 % in the ventral branches ( Fig . 7 G – I ; a v / d ratio of 0 . 1 ; Student’s t test , p (cid:6) 0 . 001 vs GFP controls ) . In embryos coelectroporated with Csk and EphA4 : : GFP , proportions of axonal GFP levels were significant increased in ventral branches compared with EphA4 : : GFP electroporated controls : 76 % of GFP (cid:2) axons were detected in the dorsal and 24 % in the ventral branches , and the v / d ratio increased to 0 . 3 ( Fig . 7 J – L ; Student’s t test , p (cid:6) 0 . 001 ) . These observations indicate that SFK inhibition attenuates EphA4 - induced LMC motor axon redirection . EphA4 receptors are thought to recruit several SFKs through juxtamembrane tyrosine residues , and a glutamic acid mutation at one of the conserved juxtamembrane tyrosines ( Y602E ) was shown to eliminate SH2 domain interactions ( Ellis et al . , 1996 ; Zisch et al . , 1998 , 2000 ) . To test whether the juxtamembrane tyrosine is required for EphA4 function in LMC axon guidance , we over - expressed this EphA4 mutant ( EphA4Y602E ) by coelec - troporating EphA4Y602E and GFP expression plasmids or con - trol EphA4 and GFP plasmids in the presumptive lumbar spinal cord at HH st . 18 / 19 and analyzed LMC axon trajectory selection at HH st . 28 / 29 . The specification and survival of LMC motor neurons were not altered after EphA4 or EphA4Y602E over - expression compared with GFP electroporated embryos ( supple - mental Fig . S6 , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental material ) . In embryos coelectroporated with EphA4 and GFP ex - pression plasmids , as expected , LMC axons were redirected into the dorsal limb : 85 % of GFP (cid:2) axons were detected in the dorsal and 15 % in the ventral limb nerves ( Fig . 7 M – O ; a v / d ratio of 0 . 2 ; Student’s t test , p (cid:6) 0 . 001 vs GFP controls ) . In embryos coelec - troporated with EphA4Y602E and GFP expression plasmids , however , a complete block of EphA4 function was observed com - pared with EphA4 and GFP coelectroporated embryos : the pro - portion of GFP (cid:2) axon detected in dorsal and ventral limb nerves was 59 % and 41 % , respectively ( Fig . 7 P – R ; a v / d ratio of 0 . 7 ; Student’s t test , p (cid:6) 0 . 001 vs EphA4 and GFP ) which was not significantly different from GFP electroporation alone ( Student’s t test , p (cid:3) 0 . 061 ) . These findings suggest that Y602 in EphA4 receptors , a potential SFK binding site , is essential for in vivo EphA4 function in LMC axon trajectory redirection . Figure6 .

We investigated these potential roles in vivo and found that SFKs are essential for the fidelity of motor axon trajectory selection in the limb . Here we discuss the differential requirement of SFK function by LMC subpopulations , the dispensable role of SFKs in axon out - growth , SFK functional redundancy and the potential role of SFKs in Eph receptor signal relay . SFKs are dispensable for motor axon outgrowth but are essential for guidance SFKs have been proposed to be important modulators of neurite extension : SFK over - expression lengthens filopodia and active Src is colocalized with Cdc42 at the tips of growth cone filopodia where it has been proposed to regulate the p21 - activated kinase , a Cdc42 effector ( Robles et al . , 2005 ; Wu et al . , 2008 ) . Interestingly , we did not observe obvious changes in axon outgrowth of limb nerves in Src mu - tants or chick embryos with attenuated or enhanced SFK activity in LMC neurons . Although we cannot exclude the possibil - ity that the residual SFK function not blocked by Csk is sufficient to mediate axon outgrowth , or that in Src mutants , Fyn substitutes for Src function , contrary to previous in vitro studies , SFK activity appears to have limited effect on motor axon outgrowth . Furthermore , although SFKs have been implicated in fasciculation ( Morse et al . , 1998 ) , the lack of gross fas - ciculation defects in SFK loss of function conditions suggest that they are dispens - able for this process in motor axons . Our demonstration that SFKs are re - quired for LMC axon guidance raises the question of how they might relay guidance signals to the cytoskeleton . SFK targets like Vav2 and chimaerins are implicated in growth cone collapse / turning but not in extension , and some like ephexin and ka - lirin are implicated in both processes ( Cowan et al . , 2005 ; Rabiner et al . , 2005 ; Sahin et al . , 2005 ; Schiller et al . , 2006 ; Beg et al . , 2007 ; Wegmeyer et al . , 2007 ) . Pre - sumably , the interaction of SFKs with these targets is essential for growth cone steering , thus , a general model of SFK function in axon guidance could first in - volve SFK interaction with the intracellu - lar domain of a guidance receptor engaged by ligand , followed by phosphorylation of SFK targets including guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) or GTPase acti - vating proteins . The activation of SFK tar - gets , such as (cid:2) 2 - chimaerin and Vav2 , is then required for localized small GTPase activity resulting in growth cone turning , as suggested by observations of aberrant midline crossing of spi - nal interneuron axons in (cid:2) 2 - chimaerin mutants and the retino - geniculate projection defects in Vav2 mutants ( Cowan et al . , 2005 ; Beg et al . , 2007 ) .

Neurosci . , April29 , 2009 • 29 ( 17 ) : 5690 – 5700 • 5697 Nck2 are expressed in spinal motor neurons when axons grow into the limb suggesting that they could relay SFK signals in LMC growth cones in the limb ( Hall et al . , 2001 ; Bladt et al . , 2003 ) . Our data provide strong evidence that although Src and Fyn are expressed in essentially all LMC neurons , their requirement for the fidelity of LMC axon trajectory selection appears differ - ential : medial LMC axon guidance appears to depend on SFK function to a greater extent than lateral LMC axon guidance . A study by Kno¨ll and Drescher ( 2004 ) also describes a differential requirement of SFKs by retinal neurons . Despite similar SFK lev - els in the temporal and nasal retinal axons , SFK inhibition in - ducesdifferenteffectsontemporalandnasalaxons , implyingthat nasal , but not temporal , axon guidance relies on SFK signaling . In LMC neurons , the differential SFK requirement could be due to different pathways being required for guidance of either LMC subgroups . Ample evidence has implicated EphA and EphB sig - naling in guidance of lateral and medial LMC axons , respectively ( Kania and Jessell , 2003 ; Luria et al . , 2008 ) and the differential sensitivity of lateral and medial LMC neurons to SFK loss could reflect the differential requirement of SFKs in EphA and EphB receptor signaling . However , since we do not know the extent of Csk and SFK protein coexpression in LMC neurons it may be that lateral LMC neurons contain much higher levels of Csk protein than medial LMC neurons , making them less sensitive to SFK function loss . The nonredundant function of Src in motor axon trajectory selection In embryonic fibroblasts , Src but not Fyn regulates cortactin and tensin hyperphosphorylation ( Nada et al . , 1993 ; Thomas et al . , 1995 ) . Fyn is nonredundant with Src in oligodendrocytes such that Fyn but not Src mutants show a forebrain myelin defect ( Sperber et al . , 2001 ) . Although known for a specific role in bone formation ( Sorianoetal . , 1991 ) , SrcisredundantwithotherSFKs in cytoskeleton rearrangement such as neuronal migration ( Kuo et al . , 2005 ) . In contrast , our studies demonstrate that Src mu - tants display strong LMC axon guidance defects suggesting a dif - ferential requirement of Src and Fyn in motor axon guidance . The distinct role among coexpressed SFKs may be enabled by their unique N - terminal domains , which could allow them to reside in different compartments of the growth cone membrane , as implied by studies showing that SFKs are required to form different types of lipid membrane microdomains ( Lovatt et al . , 2006 ; Yamazaki et al . , 2007 ) . SFK function in ephrin : Eph signaling Our experiments implicating SFKs in EphA signaling are in con - cert with previous observations in retinal neurons suggesting that SFKs are important for EphA - mediated axon guidance ( Kno¨ll and Drescher , 2004 ) . There are , however , differences between these systems , including graded versus discrete expression of Ephs and ephrins in the retinotectal and motor system , and the concerted control of axon projections by EphA and EphB signal - ing within all retinotectal axons and their dominance in nonover - lapping subsets of motor axons . In fact , it is the discrete expres - sion and involvement of EphA and EphB signaling in two populations of motor neurons that allows us to decipher the downstream mechanisms of both Eph pathways separately . Indeed , our data showing differential requirement of SFKs in ephrin : Eph signaling - mediated motor axon guidance suggest that SFKs play an important role in EphB - mediated medial LMC axon trajectory selection and only a partial role in EphA - mediated lateral LMC axon trajectory selection . SFK targets involved in either Eph pathway may be responsible for the differential SFK requirement : the Rho family GEF , kalirin , and the focal adhesion kinase , paxillin , modulate cytoskeleton dynamics as EphB but not EphA effectors ( Penzes et al . , 2003 ; Vindis et al . , 2004 ; Moeller et al . , 2006 ) . Other effectors , suchasNckandVav2 , however , caninteractwithbothEph pathways to modulate growth cone motility ( Cowan et al . , 2005 ; Wegmeyer et al . , 2007 ) . The different extent of Src involvement in either Eph pathway could thus be dependent on the differential re - quirement of these effectors . Another explanation for the partial requirement of SFKs in lateral LMC axon guidance is that SFKs are redundant with other EphAeffectorsparticipatinginlateralLMCaxonguidanceorthatSFKsareonlyrequiredfortheguidanceoflateralLMCsubpopu - lation . Duetoalaterterminationofmigrationanddifferentiation of lateral LMC neurons , a competition for common effectors like SFKs involved in multiple functions in addition to axon guid - ance , such as cell migration and differentiation , could result in a partial dependence of SFKs in lateral LMC axon trajectory . How - ever , our findings demonstrating no obvious change of cell iden - tity , survival , positions , and morphology in both LMC divisions imply little impact of SFKs on cell migration and differentiation . Other than their role as Eph effectors , SFKs have been suggested to be involved in GDNF : c - Ret signaling ( Tansey et al . , 2000 ; En - cinas et al . , 2001 ) . Interestingly , previous studies have implicated the requirement of GDNF / c - RET signaling for targeting of some lateral LMC axons ( Kramer et al . , 2006 ) . Because of a potential coordinationbetweenc - RETandEphsignalingtomediatemotor axon guidance ( Kramer et al . , 2006 ) , a proportion of SFK - sensitive lateral LMC axon could be involved in c - Ret signaling . Amongthosesignalingpathwaysimplicatedinregulatingmo - tor axon guidance , the pervasive effect of Eph signaling on LMC axon trajectories suggests that Eph signaling serves an obligate role in LMC axon guidance ( Helmbacher et al . , 2000 ; Luria et al . , 2008 ) . Our findings demonstrating the requirement of a jux - tamembrane domain tyrosine ( Y602E ) for EphA4 - mediated ax - onal repulsion supports the essential role of SFKs in motor axon guidance . Although we cannot exclude the possibility of incom - plete SFK inactivation by Csk , the stronger effect of abolishing EphA4 - induced axon redirection by EphA4Y602E compared with that of Csk over - expression may be because of interactions of Y602 with other Eph signal relay components such as Nck , (cid:2) 2 - chimaerin , or Vav2 . Nevertheless , the activities of these mol - ecules are SFK dependent ( Cowan et al . , 2005 ; Bisson et al . , 2007 ; Wegmeyer et al . , 2007 ) . Conclusion Here we show that SFKs are required for motor axon trajectory selection but appear dispensable for motor axon outgrowth . This is the first report pointing to an important role of SFKs in Eph - regulated motor axon guidance in vivo , highlighting the impor - tance of the LMC motor axon projection system as a model of a simple axon guidance decision in which the roles of receptor signaling relay machinery can be investigated .
