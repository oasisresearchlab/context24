Calderwood YALE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE In vitro studies strongly implicate the talin - binding Ras - related protein 1 ( Rap1 ) effector , Rap1 - guanosine triphosphate – interacting adapter molecule ( RIAM ) , in integrin activation . 1 Yet , the RIAM knockout mouse is viable and fertile and exhibits no platelet adhesion or aggregation defects , 2 casting doubt on the in vivo role of RIAM . In this issue of Blood , Su et al 3 and Klapproth et al 4 now show that RIAM is required for b 2 integrin – dependent leukocyte adhesion and traf ﬁ cking in vitro and in vivo , but apparently not for all Rap - and talin - meditated activation of b 1 and b 3 integrins . T alin binding to the cytoplasmic tails of the b subunits of integrin adhesion receptors is key for the activation of most integrin heterodimers . 1 The molecular mechanisms by which talin binds integrin tails and triggers integrin activation are now well accepted , 1 but how talin binding is regulated is less well understood . It is , however , generally agreed that talin must be recruited to the plasma membrane and an inhibitory talin head - rod interaction released to facilitate talin head binding to integrins and their subsequent activation . 1 Although a number of mechanisms have been proposed , 1 1 in ﬂ uential study , where agonist - induced activation of the platelet integrin a IIb b 3 was reconstructed in heterologous cells , highlighted roles for the Rap1 effector RIAM in talin - mediated integrin activation . 5 These initial results , along with biochemical and cell biological follow - up work , led to a model where RIAM binds to sites in the talin rod and this RIAM - talin complex is recruited to activated membrane - bound Rap1 5 - 8 ( see ﬁ gure ) . Indeed , fusing the minimized talin - binding portion of RIAM to the Rap1A membrane - targeting sequence was suf ﬁ cient to target talin to the plasma membrane and to activate integrins . 6 More recently , a RIAM - binding site was also identi ﬁ ed in the talin head and RIAM binding at this site was shown to contribute to release of inhibitory talin head - rod interactions . 9 RIAM may , therefore , mediate both membrane recruitment and conformational activation of talin . Loss of b 1 integrin , talin - 1 , or both Rap1A and Rap1B produces embryonic lethality in mice , 1 , 10 , 11 whereas mice orhumans de ﬁ cient in b 3 integrins exhibit Glanzmann thrombasthenia phenotypes including defective platelet aggregation and prolonged bleeding . 11 Therefore , given the extensive cellular and biochemical data implicating RIAM in talin - mediated b 1 and b 3 integrin activation , it came as a considerable surprise when earlier this year a RIAM knockout mouse was reported to be viable with no major developmental phenotype and strikingly no evident platelet defects . 2 The articles by Klapproth et al 4 and Su et al 3 now report analyses of an independently generated RIAM knockout mouse . These new studies con ﬁ rm that RIAM - de ﬁ cient mice are viable and fertile , 3 , 4 and that they lack platelet defects , 3 but both also show that the absence of RIAM produces severe defects in b 2 integrin – mediated leukocyte adhesion and traf ﬁ cking . In fact , despite normal cell surface integrin levels , the RIAM - null phenotype resembles the leukocyte adhesion de ﬁ ciency seen in b 2 integrin null mice . 11 T - lymphocyte – speci ﬁ c double knockout of Rap1A and Rap1B also produces an adhesion de ﬁ ciency 3 as does T - cell or hematopoietic - speci ﬁ c knockout of talin 1 . 4 These new data , therefore , support a key role for RIAM in Rap1 - and talin - mediated b 2 integrin activation . Notably , when compared quantitatively , loss of talin produced more severe adhesion phenotypes than loss of RIAM , 4 presumably due to alternative pathways of talin activation . A more detailed side - by - side comparison of the Rap1 - de ﬁ cient and RIAM - de ﬁ cient T cells may help determine whether RIAM mediates all Rap1 - dependent effects on b 2 integrin activation . Strikingly , when bone marrow – derived neutrophil adhesion to the a 4 b 1 ligand vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 ( VCAM - 1 ) was assessed , RIAM de ﬁ ciency only Rap1 - mediated integrin activation . Talin - mediated activation of b 2 integrins requires Rap1 and RIAM expression . A RIAM - Rap1 complex targets talin to the plasma membrane and contributes to conformational activation of talin , resulting in b 2 integrin tail binding and integrin activation . Activation of platelet a IIb b 3 is talin and Rap1 dependent but independent of RIAM . The relevant Rap1 effector is yet to be identified . RIAM dependency of a 4 b 1 activation is cell - type dependent ( not shown ) . For clarity , additional proteins contributing to Rap - dependent and - independent integrin activation are not depicted .

Assessing integrin activation state with conformation - speci ﬁ c antibodies supports the adhesion assay results . Thus , although both b 1 and b 2 integrin – mediated neutrophil adhesion is talin dependent , only b 2 integrin adhesion is strongly RIAM dependent . Likewise , T - cell adhesion to VCAM - 1 is less strongly inhibited by RIAM knockout than adhesion to ICAM - 1 , and B - cell adhesion to VCAM - 1 is largely independent of RIAM . 3 Finally , as previously reported , 2 loss of RIAM had no effect on platelet function nor onactivation oftheplateletintegrin a IIb b 3 as assessed using reporter antibodies . 3 Thus , there is considerable integrin and cell - type speci ﬁ city in the requirement of RIAM for integrin activation and , even when expressed in the same cell , b 2 integrins are more dependent on RIAM than b 1 integrins . This latter result , along with expression pro ﬁ ling , shows that the differential responses are not due to compensation for RIAM de ﬁ ciency by expression of the related family member lamellipodin . The work of Klapproth et al 4 and Su et al 3 highlights areas requiring further study to provide a complete understanding of control of integrin activation . Their data strongly suggest that RIAM - independent talin activation occurs in many or most adherent cell types ( supporting normal development in the RIAM - null mouse ) and in platelets . The existence ofalternative talinactivation methods was already appreciated 1 ; indeed , vinculin competes with RIAM for binding to talin rod andisimplicatedasanalternativetalinactivator in mature adhesions . 7 However , it is notable that Rap1 - null platelets exhibit adhesion defects under conditions where none are evident in RIAM - de ﬁ cient platelets . 2 , 3 , 12 Another Rap1 effector , RAPL , has been implicated in integrin function but , like RIAM - null mice , RAPL - null mice exhibit leukocyte adhesion de ﬁ ciencies and no platelet defects have been reported . 13 This suggests that additional Rap - dependent talin activation pathways remain to be discovered . Furthermore , how RAPL - and RIAM - mediated signals are integrated in leukocytes is currently unclear . Another major question is the mechanism of speci ﬁ city in integrin activation . Most integrins require talin but RIAM is selectively important for b 2 integrins and to a lesser extent for b 1 integrins . The basis for this is unknown although Klapproth et al 4 suggest the possibility of differential integrin localization in speci ﬁ c membrane compartments . Altogether , these recent ﬁ ndings validate the in vivo role of Rap1 – RIAM in talin - mediated b 2 integrin activation . Moreover , they illustrate that although talin is a common ﬁ nal step in integrin activation , pathways upstream of talin appear to be integrin speci ﬁ c , allowing for the ﬁ ne tissue - speci ﬁ c tuning of integrin - mediated adhesion .
