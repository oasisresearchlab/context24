ORIGINAL ARTICLE Extracellular calumenin suppresses ERK1 / 2 signaling and cell migration by protecting ﬁ bulin - 1 from MMP - 13 - mediated proteolysis Q Wang 1 , 3 , B Shen 1 , 3 , L Chen 1 , 3 , P Zheng 1 , 3 , H Feng 1 , Q Hao 1 , X Liu 1 , L Liu 1 , S Xu 1 , J Chen 1 , 2 and J Teng 1 Extracellular proteins are vital for cell activities , such as cell migration . Calumenin is highly conserved among eukaryotes , but its functions are largely unclear . Here , we identify extracellular calumenin as a suppressor of cell migration and tumor metastasis . Calumenin binds to and stabilizes ﬁ bulin - 1 , leading to inactivation of extracellular signal - regulated kinases 1 and 2 ( ERK1 / 2 ) signaling . We further identify the minimal functional domain of calumenin ( amino acids 74 – 138 and 214 – 280 ) . Depletion of calumenin induces ﬁ bulin - 1 - and phospho - ERK1 / 2 ( pERK1 / 2 ) - dependent promotion of cell migration . Consistently , in hepatocellular and pancreatic carcinoma , both calumenin and ﬁ bulin - 1 are downregulated . Furthermore , we show that matrix metalloproteinase - 13 ( MMP - 13 ) proteolyzes ﬁ bulin - 1 and that calumenin protects ﬁ bulin - 1 from cleavage by MMP - 13 . Calumenin , together with ﬁ bulin - 1 , also interacts with ﬁ bronectin and depends on both syndecan - 4 and α 5 β 1 - integrin to suppress ERK1 / 2 signaling and inhibit cell migration . Thus , extracellular calumenin regulates ﬁ bulin - 1 to have crucial roles in ERK1 / 2 signaling and cell migration .

In the extracellular space , extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins form a complicated structural and functional network , which not only provides structural support for cells , but also integrates complex , multivalent signals to regulate various physiological processes , like cell migration . 1 Fibulin - 1 is a secreted glycoprotein , which interacts with many other ECM proteins , such as ﬁ bronectin , laminin , ﬁ brinogen , aggrecan and versican , 2 – 4 and is thus considered as an adhesion bridge of ECM structures . 1 Fibulin - 1 inhibits cell adhesion and migration via ﬁ bronectin and the receptor syndecan - 4 , 4 , 5 suppresses angiogenesis possibly through angiogenin 6 , 7 and regulates cardiac ventricular morpho - genesis via versican and ErbB2 , 8 suggesting that ﬁ bulin - 1 regulates cell adhesion and migration . However , the molecular mechanism underlying the functional regulation of ﬁ bulin - 1 in extracellular space is largely unknown . Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) are the major extracellular proteinases that regulate ECM homeostasis and remodeling . 9 MMP - 13 is a collagenase capable of cleaving rigid collagen ﬁ brils to remodel ECM structures , as well as to release embedded signaling molecules . 10 Besides , MMP - 13 also cleaves other substrates , such as gelatin , aggrecan , perlecan and tenacin - C . 11 The expression of MMP - 13 is in ﬂ uenced by a wide range of cytokines and hormones , is commonly upregulated in tumors and is correlated with cancer metastasis and aggressiveness . 11 – 13 Furthermore , MMP - 13 is secreted as an immature precursor , and undergoes activation by auto - proteolysis or peptide removal by several other MMPs . 14 However , how MMP - 13 is regulated extracellularly after maturing remains to be determined . Human calumenin , a member of the CREC protein family , 15 is encoded by the CALU gene ( NCBI GeneID : 813 ) . 16 Fifteen alternative splice variants are identi ﬁ ed as calumenin - 1 – 15 , with calumenin - 1 / 2 ( shown as calumenin without speci ﬁ c indication ) being the most abundant . 17 – 19 Calumenin contains a signal peptide and is detectable in the extracellular space . 20 , 21 Proteomic analysis suggests that calumenin is downregulated in MHCC97 - H cells , a human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cell line with high metastatic potential , compared with low metastatic potential MHCC97 - L cells . 22 Similarly , a lower expression level of calumenin was also reported in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 23 and lung squamous cell carcinoma . 24 Nevertheless , the physiological function of extracellular calumenin , and whether there is a correlation between calumenin expression and tumor malignancy remain unclear . Here we show that calumenin protects ﬁ bulin - 1 from MMP - 13 - mediated proteolysis , and thus inhibiting extracellular signal - regulated kinases 1 and 2 ( ERK1 / 2 ) phosphorylation and cell migration . RESULTS Extracellular calumenin inhibits cell migration We ﬁ rst tested the effect of calumenin on cell migration .

To test whether it is the extracellular calumenin that impaired cell migration , we added conditioned medium from calumenin - 1 / 2 - EGFP - expressing HEK293T cells to HeLa cells , and this also inhibited wound healing of HeLa cells ( Figures 1a and b ) , while had no detectable in ﬂ uence on cell proliferation indicated by BrdU labeling ( Supplementary Figure S1b ) . Transwell assays con ﬁ rmed that extracellular calumenin - 1 / 2 - EGFP suppressed cell migration of HeLa ( Figure 1c ) and MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Supplementary Figure S1c ) . To exclude the potential steric hindrance of the C - terminal EGFP tag , we used calumenin - 1 / 2 - internal ribosome entry site ( IRES ) - EGFP in Matrigel - coated transwell assays , and found that the numbers of HeLa cells migrated through the transwell were also signi ﬁ cantly decreased ( Figure 1d ) . Furthermore , addition of puri ﬁ ed calumenin - 1 - His - Strep to the medium of HeLa cells further substantiated that extracellular calumenin suppressed cell migra - tion ( Figure 1e ) . To investigate the effect of calumenin on cell migration and invasion in vivo , we used the classical B16 melanoma mouse model . 25 We ﬁ rst generated B16 / F10 melanoma cell lines stably expressing calumenin - 1 / 2 - IRES - EGFP ( Supplementary Figure S1d ) . Wound - healing assays showed that calumenin - 1 / 2 overexpression also suppressed B16 / F10 cell migration ( Supplementary Figure S1e ) . We then injected these cells into mice through the tail vein and observed their lungs 2 weeks later . The number of pulmonary metastatic colonies formed by calumenin - 1 / 2 - overexpressing cells was signi ﬁ cantly fewer than that by the control cells ( Figure 1f and Supplementary Figure S1f ) , while no signi ﬁ cant difference in the xenograft tumor weight ( Supplementary Figure S1g ) and volume ( Supplementary Figure S1h ) were observed when subcutaneously transplanting these cell lines into nude mice . Then , loss - of - function of endogenous calumenin - 1 / 2 , either by blockade with its antibody ( Figure 1g ) or by knockdown with small interfering RNA ( siRNA ; Figures 1h and i ) in HeLa cells , markedly promoted cell migration , while addition of condi - tioned medium containing calumenin - 1 / 2 signi ﬁ cantly rescued the phenotype induced by knockdown of calumenin - 1 / 2 ( Figure 1h and i ) . Consistently , knockdown of calumenin - 1 / 2 in B16 / F0 cells also promoted cell migration ( Supplementary Figures S2a – c ) , and increased the number of pulmonary metastatic colonies ( Figure 1j ) . Together , these ﬁ ndings reveal that extracellular calumenin suppresses cell migration both in vitro and in vivo . Minimal functional domain of calumenin for inhibiting cell migration To determine the minimal functional domain of calumenin - 1 , we ﬁ rst tested the effects of 15 isoforms of calumenin on cell migration , and found that calumenin - 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 7 inhibited HeLa cell migration ( Supplementary Figure S3a ) . After analyzing the exon composition of these isoforms , we further generated 14 EGFP - tagged truncates , named calumenin - 1 - Δ 1 to calumenin - 1 - Δ 14 ( Figure 2a ) , and transfected them into HeLa cells . Wound - healing assays showed that these truncates fell into two categories , one inhibiting cell migration like the full - length calumenin - 1 - EGFP , while the other having no signi ﬁ cant effect ( Figures 2b and d ) . The two shortest truncates , calumenin - 1 - Δ 13 ( amino acids 74 – 138 and 214 – 315 ) and calumenin - 1 - Δ 14 ( amino acids 74 – 138 and 214 – 280 ) were con ﬁ rmed to suppress cell migration by transwell assays ( Figure 2e ) . To validate the identi ﬁ ed minimal functional domain of calumenin - 1 in vivo , we generated B16 / F10 melanoma cell lines stably expressing calumenin - 1 - Δ 14 - EGFP ( Supplementary Figure S3b ) , which showed reduced wound - healing ef ﬁ ciency ( Supplementary Figure S3c ) . We then injected them into mice through the tail vein . The number of pulmonary metastatic colonies formed by these cells was signi ﬁ cantly fewer than that of the control group ( Figure 2f and Supplementary Figure S3d ) . Thus , the minimal functional domain , calumenin - 1 - Δ 14 , is suf ﬁ cient to suppress cell migration . Extracellular calumenin inhibits cell migration via suppressing ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation The mitogen - activated protein kinase signaling pathway is known as a main signaling pathway to regulate cell migration , 26 thus we tested the three major mitogen - activated protein kinases : ERK1 / 2 , p38 and JNK . Overexpression of calumenin - 1 / 2 suppressed the level of phospho - ERK1 / 2 ( pERK1 / 2 ) , but not p - p38 or pJNK , in HeLa ( Figure 3a ) and B16 / F10 melanoma cells ( Figure 3b ) . Consistently , both siRNA knock - down ( Figure 3c ) and antibody blockade of calumenin - 1 / 2 ( Figure 3d ) promoted ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation , and the pERK1 / 2 level in siRNA - treated cells was restored by adding conditioned medium containing calumenin - 1 / 2 ( Figure 3c ) . In addition , a decrease of pERK1 / 2 was detected 7 h after addition of the eukaryotically expressed and puri ﬁ ed calumenin - 1 to the medium of HeLa cells ( Figure 3e ) . Similar results were observed for pMEK1 / 2 ( Figure 3f ) , the upstream kinase of ERK1 / 2 . We then asked whether the inhibitory effect of calumenin on cell migration was pERK1 / 2 dependent . In the presence of U0126 , an inhibitor of ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation , 27 blockade of calumenin by its antibody failed to promote cell migration ( Figure 3d ) . Moreover , the minimal functional domain of calumenin , calumenin - 1 - Δ 13 and calumenin - 1 - Δ 14 , also decreased the pERK1 / 2 level ( Figure 3g ) . Together , these data suggest that the inhibition of cell migration by extracellular calumenin is dependent on ERK1 / 2 activation . ERK1 / 2 regulates actin polymerization and stimulates the formation of lamellipodia to promote cell migration . 28 , 29 To examine the effect of calumenin on cell morphology , we labeled actin ﬁ laments along with paxillin , a marker of focal adhesion . 30 In both HeLa ( Figure 3h ) and B16 / F10 cells ( Figures 3h and i ) , the elevation of calumenin - 1 / 2 protein level induced a smooth cell periphery and promoted the cells to aggregate in a cobblestone - like formation . Conversely , calumenin - 1 / 2 knock - down in B16 / F0 cells resulted in an elongated ﬁ broblast - like morphology with pseudopodia - like protrusions ( Figures 3j and k ) . Thus , calumenin induces cell migration - related morphology changes . Calumenin interacts with ﬁ bulin - 1 To screen for calumenin - interacting proteins involved in the ERK1 / 2 pathway , in the extracellular space or on the plasma membrane , we performed immunoprecipitation assays of total cell lysates and conditioned medium of HEK293T cells expressing calumenin - 1 - EGFP . The bound proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate – polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry . Many potential binding proteins were identi ﬁ ed ( Supplementary Figures S4a – c ) , among which ﬁ bulin - 1 was the most abundant ( Figure 4a ) . As it was also reported to inhibit ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation , 4 we focused on ﬁ bulin - 1 . Fibulin - 1 has four isoforms produced by alternative mRNA splicing ( Supplementary Figure S4b ) with ﬁ bulin - 1D being the longest . 31 We then used ﬁ bulin - 1D ( described as ﬁ bulin - 1 , unless otherwise indicated ) and con ﬁ rmed its interaction with calum - enin - 1 / 2 by immunoprecipitation in conditioned medium ( Figures 4b and c ) . Furthermore , both in vitro binding assays ( Figure 4d ) and yeast two - hybrid assays ( Supplementary Figure S4d ) showed that calumenin - 1 / 2 directly interacted with ﬁ bulin - 1 . In addition , Calumenin inhibits cell migration by ﬁ bulin - 1 Q Wang et al 1007 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene ( 2015 ) 1006 – 1018 the minimal functional domain of calumenin , calumenin - 1 - Δ 13 and calumenin - 1 - Δ 14 , also interacted with ﬁ bulin - 1 ( Figure 4e ) , suggesting that calumenin - 1 - Δ 14 ( amino acids 78 – 134 and 218 – 280 ) are suf ﬁ cient for its interaction with ﬁ bulin - 1 . However , the diminished interaction of calumenin minimal functional truncates and ﬁ bulin - 1 suggested that the other parts of calumenin may also facilitate its interaction with ﬁ bulin - 1 ( Figure 4e ) . We then generated EGFP - tagged truncation mutants of ﬁ bulin - 1 to map its interaction domain with calumenin . Calumenin - 2 - glutathione S - transferase co - immunoprecipitated with the full - length ﬁ bulin - 1 and its truncates ﬁ bulin - 1 Δ 4 , Δ 5 and Δ 6 ( Figure 4f ) . All these truncates contained EGF - like repeats 7 – 9 , suggesting these repeats ( amino acids 441 – 578 ) of ﬁ bulin - 1 are crucial for its interaction with calumenin . Collectively , calumenin directly interacts with ﬁ bulin - 1 in the extracellular space , and amino acids 78 – 134 and 218 – 280 of calumenin and EGF - like repeats 7 – 9 of ﬁ bulin - 1 are required for their interaction . Calumenin inhibits cell migration by ﬁ bulin - 1 Q Wang et al 1008 Oncogene ( 2015 ) 1006 – 1018 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited Calumenin stabilizes ﬁ bulin - 1 and both calumenin and ﬁ bulin - 1 are inversely correlated with hepatocellular and pancreatic carcinoma Next , we tested the relationship between calumenin and ﬁ bulin - 1 in cell migration . Blockade of ﬁ bulin - 1 by its antibody signi ﬁ cantly reduced the suppressive activity of calumenin - 1 on HeLa cell migration ( Figure 5a ) , and effectively blocked the calumenin - 1 - induced reduction of ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation ( Figure 5b ) . More - over , after knockdown of ﬁ bulin - 1 , no signi ﬁ cant difference was detected between control and calumenin - 1 - overexpressing B16 / F10 cells in wound - healing assays ( Supplementary Figures S4e and f ) . Consistently , the number of pulmonary metastatic colonies formed by these cells did not show any signi ﬁ cant difference ( Figure 5c ) . All these data suggest that calumenin suppresses cell migration in a ﬁ bulin - 1 - dependent manner . We noticed that the suppressive ability on cell migration was more ef ﬁ cient in cells co - expressing ﬁ bulin - 1 and calumenin - 1 than the expression of each alone ( Supplementary Figure S4g ) , implying that calumenin and ﬁ bulin - 1 function synergistically to inhibit cell migration . Interestingly , we found that depletion of calumenin - 1 / 2 either by siRNA ( Figure 5d and Supplementary Figure S2a ) or antibody ( Figure 5e ) reduced the ﬁ bulin - 1 protein level , whereas overexpression of calumenin - 1 / 2 markedly enhanced it in the extracellular space ( Figures 3b and 5f ) , with its mRNA level unchanged ( Supplementary Figure S4h ) . The minimal functional domain of calumenin , calumenin - 1 - Δ 13 and calumenin - 1 - Δ 14 , also enhanced the ﬁ bulin - 1 protein level ( Figure 5g ) . Together , these data suggest that calumenin stabilizes ﬁ bulin - 1 in the extracellular space . Proteins that inhibit cell migration are frequently downregu - lated in cancer . 32 Considering that both calumenin and ﬁ bulin - 1 inhibit cell migration , we sought to determine whether they were simultaneously downregulated in cancer cells and tumor tissues from patients . Both the calumenin - 1 / 2 and ﬁ bulin - 1 protein levels were downregulated , while the pERK1 / 2 level was elevated in high metastatic potential MHCC97 - H cells , compared with low metastatic potential MHCC97 - L cells ( Supplementary Figure S5a ) . Consistently , immunohistochemical staining showed decreased calumenin - 1 / 2 and ﬁ bulin - 1 in most HCC tissues ( Figure 5h ) . In detail , in samples from 75 HCC patients ( Supplementary Figure S5b and Supplementary Table S1 ) , ~ 65 % showed a decrease of both calumenin - 1 / 2 and ﬁ bulin - 1 in tumor tissues ( Figure 5i ) . Moreover , patients with higher HCC grades ( II – III ) had lower protein levels of both calumenin - 1 / 2 and ﬁ bulin - 1 than those with lower grades ( I – II ) ( Supplementary Figures S5c - e ) . Similar to HCC , both calumenin - 1 / 2 and ﬁ bulin - 1 displayed clearly lower expres - sion in pancreatic tumor tissues compared with their adjacent normal tissues ( Figure 5j and Supplementary Table S2 ) . In samples from 74 patients with pancreatic carcinoma , ~ 54 % showed a decrease of both proteins ( Figure 5k and Supplementary Figure S5f ) . Together , these results reveal that both calumenin and ﬁ bulin - 1 are signi ﬁ cantly downregulated in HCC and pancreatic carcinoma . Calumenin protects ﬁ bulin - 1 from cleavage by MMP - 13 ECM proteins are usually proteolyzed by MMPs , 9 leading us to hypothesize that calumenin protects ﬁ bulin - 1 from MMP - mediated proteolysis . However , no MMP has been identi ﬁ ed to cleave ﬁ bulin - 1 . Therefore , we ﬁ rst overexpressed several MMPs ( MMP - 9 , - 13 , - 14 , - 15 and - 19 ) in HeLa cells , and found that only MMP - 13 overexpression decreased the extracellular ﬁ bulin - 1 protein level ( Figure 6a ) . Consistently , in vitro cleavage assays using the puri ﬁ ed proteins also showed that MMP - 13 – 3× ﬂ ag cleaved ﬁ bulin - 1 - HA , leading to the appearance of speci ﬁ c cleaved bands ( Figure 6b ) . Therefore , these data suggest that ﬁ bulin - 1 is a substrate of MMP - 13 . To investigate the effect of calumenin on MMP - 13 - mediated ﬁ bulin - 1 degradation , we co - overexpressed calumenin - 1 and MMP - 13 , and found that calumenin - 1 suppressed the cleavage of ﬁ bulin - 1 protein by MMP - 13 ( Figure 6c ) . Meanwhile , neither MMP - 13 nor calumenin - 1 in ﬂ uenced the mRNA level of ﬁ bulin - 1 ( Supplementary Figure S4h ) . Further in vitro cleavage assays also demonstrated that the cleavage of ﬁ bulin - 1 by MMP - 13 was suppressed in the presence of calumenin - 1 - EGFP ( Figure 6d ) . To further con ﬁ rm the relationships of calumenin , ﬁ bulin - 1 and MMP - 13 on cell migration , we performed transwell assays . MMP - 13 enhanced cell migration , while blockade of ﬁ bulin - 1 by its antibody eliminated this enhancement , suggesting that MMP - 13 functions in a ﬁ bulin - 1 - dependent manner ( Figure 6e ) . Importantly , overexpres - sion of calumenin - 1 - EGFP abolished the MMP - 13 - mediated promo - tion of cell migration ( Figure 6f ) . Together , these data reveal that MMP - 13 degrades ﬁ bulin - 1 to facilitate cell migration , while calumenin binds to ﬁ bulin - 1 and protects it from MMP - 13 - induced cleavage to inhibit cell migration . Calumenin inhibits cell migration through ﬁ bronectin , syndecan - 4 and α 5 β 1 - integrin Fibulin - 1 was reported to inhibit cell migration via its association with ﬁ bronectin , 4 leading us to investigate the relationships Figure 1 .

Calumenin inhibits cell migration by ﬁ bulin - 1 Q Wang et al 1009 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene ( 2015 ) 1006 – 1018 among ﬁ bronectin , ﬁ bulin - 1 and calumenin . Overexpressed calumenin - 1 - EGFP interacted with both endogenous ﬁ bulin - 1 and ﬁ bronectin ( Figure 4b ) , and endogenous calumenin - 1 / 2 and ﬁ bulin - 1 were co - immunoprecipitated with ﬁ bronectin ( Figure 7a ) , suggesting that calumenin forms a complex with ﬁ bulin - 1 and ﬁ bronectin . Besides , calumenin - 1 / 2 - EGFP overexpression led to more ﬁ bulin - 1 co - immunoprecipitated with ﬁ bronectin ( Figure 7b ) . Blockade of calumenin - 1 / 2 by its antibody facilitated cell migration , however , in the presence of anti - ﬁ bronectin antibody , anti - calumenin - 1 / 2 antibody failed to enhance cell migration ( Figure 7c ) , suggesting that ﬁ bronectin is indispensable for calumenin and ﬁ bulin - 1 to inhibit cell migration . Previous work showed that ﬁ bulin - 1 inhibits ﬁ broblast cell adhesion through competing with syndecan - 4 to bind to ﬁ bronectin , thus inhibiting cell adhesion and migration . 5 There - fore , we examined whether syndecan - 4 is required for the Figure 2 .

Calumenin inhibits cell migration by ﬁ bulin - 1 Q Wang et al 1010 Oncogene ( 2015 ) 1006 – 1018 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited function of calumenin to inhibit cell migration . The enhanced cell migration induced by anti - calumenin - 1 / 2 antibody treatment was abolished by adding anti - syndecan - 4 antibody to the medium ( Figure 7d ) . Moreover , the effect of antibody against calumenin on cell migration was also antagonized by antibodies against α 5 β 1 - integrin ( Figure 7e ) , a major cell surface receptor of ﬁ bronectin 33 that synergistically function with syndecans in cell migration and adhesion . 34 , 35 Although more studies are needed to address their relationships , these data suggest that the inhibition of cell migration by calumenin depends on ﬁ bronectin , syndecan - 4 and α 5 β 1 - integrin . In conclusion , calumenin directly interacts with ﬁ bulin - 1 , protects it from cleavage by MMP - 13 , and enhances the binding of ﬁ bulin - 1 to ﬁ bronectin . Through syndecan - 4 and α 5 β 1 - integrin receptors , the formation of a calumenin / ﬁ bulin - 1 / ﬁ bronectin complex leads to inhibition of the ERK1 / 2 signaling pathway and the subsequent suppression of cell migration ( Figure 7f ) . DISCUSSION ECM remodeling is a key event of cell migration , and the activity of extracellular proteases , especially MMPs , has crucial roles in this process . 9 Among MMPs , MMP - 13 is highly expressed in tumor and stroma tissues , and is a suitable target of anti - cancer and anti - in ﬂ ammation drugs . 13 , 36 , 37 Previous studies showed that MMP - 13 activity is mainly regulated at three distinct levels : transcription , post - translational activation and interaction with inhibitors . 11 , 38 However , as far as we know , no protein has been reported to bind to MMP - 13 substrates to inhibit MMP - 13 - mediated cleavage . Here , we show that ﬁ bulin - 1 cleavage by MMP - 13 is blocked by calumenin . Whether calumenin directly inhibits MMP - 13 activity , or protects ﬁ bulin - 1 from MMP - 13 access remains to be investigated . Nevertheless , our ﬁ ndings open a new dimension in the understanding of the regulation of MMP - 13 . We propose that combined treatment with calumenin and inhibitors of MMP - 13 may serve as a new therapeutic strategy for tumor metastasis . Besides , calumenin interacts with ﬁ bronectin , which is also a substrate of MMP - 13 . 39 It is possible that calumenin also inhibits MMP - 13 - mediated proteolysis of ﬁ bronectin to inhibit cell migration , which needs further investigation . Fibulin - 1 assists in the formation of macromolecular ECM structures , 1 and also inhibits cell migration . 4 Here , we ﬁ rst identify ﬁ bulin - 1 as a substrate of MMP - 13 , and detect MMP - 13 - digested bands of ﬁ bulin - 1 ( Figure 6b ) . We propose that multiple MMP - 13 cleavage sites exist on ﬁ bulin - 1 , which is consistent with the previous reports that MMPs tend to cleave substrates at many sites . 40 As these bands ( mostly > 50 kDa ) are recognized by anti - HA antibody , and the HA epitope is tagged at the C - terminus of ﬁ bulin - 1 , we speculate that some of the MMP - 13 cleavage sites are located in its N - terminus . Considering that calumenin is associated with EGF - like repeats 7 – 9 on the C - terminus of ﬁ bulin - 1 , it is unlikely that calumenin simply shields the MMP - 13 cleavage sites on ﬁ bulin - 1 , but rather stabilizes its whole structure . Our results , as well as previous reports , show that the full - length ﬁ bulin - 1 inhibits cell migration , 5 while no such inhibition occurs after its degradation by MMP - 13 . However , the MMP - digested fragments of some ECM proteins bind to and activate cell surface receptors . 33 Therefore , whether the MMP - 13 - digested fragments of ﬁ bulin - 1 have regulatory roles in cell migration or in other physiological process is worth further investigation . In HCC and pancreatic carcinoma tissues , we ﬁ nd that calumenin and ﬁ bulin - 1 are inversely correlated with tumor grade and metastatic potential . A similar situation of calumenin is also described in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 23 and lung squamous cell carcinoma . 24 A recent report showed that ﬁ bulin - 1 mRNA and protein levels are reduced in human HCC samples . 41 These data further strengthen that calumenin and ﬁ bulin - 1 suppress tumor metastasis . However , progressive expres - sion of calumenin is reported in colon 42 and endometrial carcinomas . 43 Similarly , elevated ﬁ bulin - 1 are also detected in ovarian and breast carcinomas , 44 , 45 and ﬁ bulin - 1C may participate in ovarian tumorigenesis , 46 suggesting that the inverse association between calumenin , ﬁ bulin - 1 and tumor metastasis may be tissue speci ﬁ c .
