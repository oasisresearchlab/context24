In this review , we focus on endothelial stiffness , a fundamental biomechanical property that re ﬂ ects cell resistance to deformation . In the ﬁ rst part of the review , we describe the mechanisms that determine endothelial stiffness , including RhoA - dependent contractile response , actin architecture and crosslinking , as well as the contributions of the intermediate ﬁ laments , vimentin and lamin . Then , we review the factors that induce endothelial stiffening , with the emphasis on mechanical signals , such as ﬂ uid shear stress , stretch and stiffness of the extracellular matrix , which are well - known to control endothelial biomechanics . We also describe in detail the contribution of lipid factors , particularly oxidized lipids , that were also shown to be crucial in regulation of endothelial stiffness . Furthermore , we discuss the relative contributions of these two mechanisms of endothelial stiffening in vasculature in cardiovascular disease and aging . Finally , we present the current state of knowledge about the role of endothelial stiffening in the disruption of endothelial cell - cell junctions that are responsible for the maintenance of the endothelial barrier . KEYWORDS endothelial biomechanics , shear stress , matrix stiffness , oxidized lipids , endothelial barrier 1 Introduction Deterioration of vascular function with age or vascular aging is recognized today as a major factor in the aging process , whereas maintaining vascular health is considered a promising direction in developing anti - ageing strategies ( Perk et al . , 2012 ; Kajuluri et al . , 2021 ) . A major characteristic of vascular aging and an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease and mortality is stiffening of large elastic arteries , particularly aorta , which increases throughout the normal life span and is exacerbated by cardiovascular risk factors , such as obesity and diabetes ( Laurent et al . , 2001 ; Mitchell et al . , 2007 ; Mitchell , 2008 ; Palombo and Kozakova , 2016 ) . Aortic stiffening is also associated with age - related cognitive decline ( Waldstein et al . , 2008 ; Tarumi et al . , 2013 ) , as well as with kidney damage ( Safar et al . , 2004 ) . A major link between the stiffening of large arteries and functional vascular dysfunction is the impairment of peripheral microvascular function , which is manifested in decreased ﬂ ow - induced vasodilation and has been demonstrated in several large cohorts of human subjects including the Framingham study ( Mitchell et al . , 2005 ; Cheung et al . , 2007 ) . Arterial stiffening results in reduced compliance of the arterial vascular wall to changes in blood pressure and blood velocity and thus , creates abnormal shear stress patterns that might be damaging to the endothelium ( Mitchell , 2008 ) .

Frontiers in Physiology frontiersin . org 01 TYPE Review PUBLISHED 11 January 2023 DOI 10 . 3389 / fphys . 2022 . 1081119 The stiffening of the arterial wall may also lead to increased contractility of the endothelium , which in turn impairs the integrity of the endothelial monolayer ( Kohn et al . , 2015a ) . Arterial stiffness is primarily determined by the aggregate stiffness of the multi - layers of vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) , the major cellular component of the arterial wall , and by the composition of extracellular matrix . Typically , extracellular stiffening is a result of the loss and fragmentation of elastin and depositions and crosslinking of collagen by advanced glycation end - products ( AGEs ) ( Kohn et al . , 2015a ; Palombo and Kozakova , 2016 ) , and VCMCs stiffening is a result of the cytoskeletal remodeling ( Vatner et al . , 2021 ) . Importantly , endothelial stiffness is critically distinct from a more thoroughly studied stiffness of the vascular wall . Mechanically , the stiffness of the endothelium , a single cell monolayer that constitutes the inner lining of the blood vessels is not expected to contribute to the general stiffness of the vascular wall . However , an increasing amount of evidence suggests that endothelial stiffness per se has signi ﬁ cant physiological impact on the vascular function , including disruption of the endothelial barrier and recruitment of monocytes to the sites of in ﬂ ammation , two major endothelial functions . There are also multiple connection between VCMCs and ECs which contribute to regulating arterial stiffening : on one hand , an increase in VCMC stiffness contribute to the stiffening of the arterial wall , which in turn induce endothelial stiffening , and on the other hand , endothelial stiffening may impair endothelial vasodilatory function , which would enhance the contractility of VCMCs contributing to vascular stiffness . It is critical , therefore , to understand the mechanisms that govern endothelial stiffness and determine the contribution of endothelial stiffening to vascular aging . In this review , we discuss the current state of knowledge about the factors and the mechanisms that govern endothelial stiffness in general and in aging vasculature . 2 Determinants of endothelial cortical stiffness Cellular stiffness is a fundamental biomechanical property that re ﬂ ects the elasticity and deformability of the cellular envelope , a bi - component system consisting of the membrane lipid bilayer and the sub - membrane cytoskeleton , also known as the cytoskeletal cortex . It is well known that membrane lipid bilayer is a much softer material than the cytoskeleton and therefore it is the sub - membrane cortex that constitutes the cellular mechanical scaffold . Hence , cellular stiffness is frequently referred to as cortical stiffness . The three major cytoskeletal networks in mammalian cells are micro ﬁ laments ( ~ 7 nm diameter ) comprised primarily of actin ﬁ laments , microtubule ( ~ 25 nm diameter ) comprised of tubulin and intermediate ﬁ laments ; ( ~ 10 nm diameter ) , which can be comprised of several types of proteins with vimentin being the major one in endothelial cells ( Berhadsky and Vasiliev , 1989 ) . The biomechanical properties of the three networks were shown to be clearly distinct , as assessed in isolated ﬁ laments : the greatest resistance to stress is exhibited by actin ﬁ laments that have highest rigidity but ﬂ uidize at high strains , vimentin ﬁ laments are less rigid but stiffen at higher strains and microtubule , while relatively stiff were predicted not contribute signi ﬁ cantly to cellular viscoelastic properties because of their low abundance in cellular cortex ( Janmey et al . , 1991 ) . 2 . 1 Actin cytoskeleton Actin cytoskeleton is a network of actin ﬁ laments , myosin and different actin - binding proteins , which constitutes the main component of the sub - membrane cytoskeleton or the cell cortex , and exists under continuous tension that arises from the activity of myosin motors ( Morone et al . , 2006 ) . Multiple studies established that endothelial deformability also depends primarily on actin cytoskeleton . First , using micropipette aspiration , which measures membrane / cortical deformation in response to negative pressure applied to the cell surface , it was demonstrated that disruption of F - actin either with cytochalasin B , a capping protein , that interferes with the formation of actin ﬁ laments or with latrunculin A , which binds to G - actin , result in signi ﬁ cant endothelial softening , disruption of the tubule has little or no effect ( Sato et al . , 1990 ; By ﬁ eld et al . , 2004 ) . Substrate adherent capillary endothelial cells were also shown to be under internal mechanical tension , as they spontaneously retracted when cut across by a microneedle ( Pourati et al . , 1998 ) . This pre - existing tension was largely abrogated by disrupting the integrity of F - actin , indicating that actin is the stress bearing element of the cytoskeleton . Furthermore , actin tension was also shown to correlate with cell stiffness , as determined by magnetic twisting cytometry , and proposed to constitute a key determinant of cellular deformability ( Pourati et al . , 1998 ) . Furthermore , disruption of F - actin also signi ﬁ cantly decreases the force required to pull membrane tethers in aortic endothelial cells indicating that it is a major determinant of membrane biomechanics and membrane - cytoskeletal adhesion ( Sun et al . , 2007 ) . Two general mechanisms are known to contribute to increased cortical tension / cortical stiffness : 1 ) increase in actomyosin contractility and stress ﬁ ber formation , 2 ) increase in the abundance and / or the crosslinking of cortical actin . Actomyosin - mediated contractility is a major mechanism for generating mechanical stress and increased cortical tension in all mammalian cells ( Heissler and Manstein , 2013 ; Murrell et al . , 2015 ) . In my cells , the contractility occurs as a result of the interaction between myosin II molecular motor and actin ﬁ laments and is determined by the phosphorylation status of myosin light chain ( MLC ) regulatory domain of myosin II ( Heissler and Manstein , 2013 ; Murrell et al . , 2015 ) . MLC phosphorylation promotes myosin II activity and triggers the assembly of stress ﬁ bers , actomyosin bundles that have contractile properties . The upstream regulators of MLC phosphorylation are RhoA / Rho - kinase coiled - coil containing kinase ( ROCK ) pathway and myosin light chain kinase ( MLCK ) , which in turn can be activated by a variety of factors . Numerous studies showed that activation of RhoA / ROCK pathway induces formation of stress ﬁ bers and enhances cellular contractility [ e . g . , ( Ridley and Hall , 1992 ; Totsukawa et al . , 2000 ) ] . The major pathway by which ROCK phosphorylated MLC is not direct but mediated via the inhibition protein phosphatase 1 ( PP1 or MLCP ) , which dephosphorylates ( Matsumura and Hartshorne , 2008 ) . MLCK activation is Ca / Calmodulin dependent and directly phosphorylates MLC ( Takashima , 2009 ) . Initially , it was shown through indirect intracellular cytoplasmic microrheology measurements that an increase in the nanoscale intracellular viscosity of ﬁ brobasts was correlated with an increase in RhoA activity ( Kole et al . , 2004 ) . In a later study , it was directly demonstrated that activation of RhoA / ROCK increases stress ﬁ ber formation , cytoskeletal tension , and cell stiffness , as thoroughly assessed by Lim et al . ( 2012 ) . More speci ﬁ cally , Atomic Force Frontiers in Physiology frontiersin . org 02 Aguilar et al . 10 . 3389 / fphys . 2022 . 1081119 Microscopy ( AFM ) was utilized with AFM probe tips coated with ECM ( laminin or ﬁ bronectin ) so that contact with vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) would result in cell adhesion via focal adhesion ( FA ) formation . Cells were mechanically stimulated by systematically retracting the AFM probe attached to the FA . By utilizing this AFM technique in conjunction with VSMCs transfected to ﬂ uorescently express vinculin , RhoA , and actin , the authors were able to elegantly demonstrate that direct mechanical stimulation led to an increase in localized RhoA activity at the site of stimulation , which subsequently led to increases in F - actin stress ﬁ ber activity and cellular tension . They utilized loss of function / gain of function of RhoA constructs for the RhoA - EGFP transfections : a dominant negative version ( low RhoA ) , and a constitutively active version ( high RhoA ) and a wild type as control . Cells with the dominant negative version had very low cell stiffness compared to the wild type variety , and cells with the constitutively active version had higher stiffness values . With robust retraction of the AFM probe ( simulating a high application of tensile stress ) , the dominant negative RhoA cells detached from the AFM probe very quickly after the initial adhesion . Meanwhile , the constitutively active RhoA cells were found to strongly resist the high tensile stress application of the AFM probe retraction . They also demonstrated that blocking Rho - kinase via the speci ﬁ c inhibitor Y - 27632 or blocking myosin function by the myosin inhibitor ML - 7 led to low cytoskeletal tension with decreased levels of stress ﬁ bers , cytoskeletal tension , and cell stiffness . In more recent studies , CN03 has been utilized as a potent Rho activator , which constitutively activates Rho by blocking GTPase activity without affecting the activity or Rac and Cdc42 ( Bade et al . , 2017 ) . Showed that CN03 greatly enhances basal stress ﬁ ber formation , which has been previously reported to be the primary sub - category of stress ﬁ bers associated with cell tension and stiffness ( Ingber and Tensegrity , 2003 ; Kumar et al . , 2006 ) . Interestingly , the intracellular spatial distribution of RhoA / ROCK and MLCK was shown to be distinct resulting in differential patterns of stress ﬁ ber formation : the assembly of the stress ﬁ bers in the center of the cells was shown to be mainly ROCK dependent , whereas in the periphery , it was shown to be dependent more strongly on MLCK ( Totsukawa et al . , 2000 ) . This raises a possibility that different stimuli that activate these pathways are also likely to generate spatially distinct stiffening patterns . 2 . 2 Cortical actin architecture While many studies assume that cortical tension is determined primarily by the expression and phosphorylation levels of myosin with actin ﬁ bers only providing the scaffold for myosin activity ( Tinevez et al . , 2009 ) , growing number of studies indicate that actin architecture also plays a major role in determining the cortical tension . Speci ﬁ cally , it was shown that altering actin architecture using surface micropatterning and the network organization of the ﬁ bers play major roles in the contractile response and that speci ﬁ c actin crosslinkers ( also known as actin binding proteins ) can enhance or inhibit the contractility under the same expression / phosphorylation levels of myosin ( Reymann et al . , 2012 ; Ennomani et al . , 2016 ) . Additionally actin binding proteins have been previously well - established to mediate F - actin stiffness at the cell ’ s leading edge cortical actin bundles ( Dos Remedios et al . , 2003 ; Uribe and Jay , 2009 ; Pollard , 2016 ; Vakhrusheva et al . , 2022 ) . In one particular study , α - actinin , plastin , or fascin were varied for their concentration and bundle size ( these speci ﬁ c actin binding proteins are abundant in eukaryotic cells ) ( Claessens et al . , 2006 ) . Leading edge cortical actin bundle stiffness was precisely measured and found to differ uniquely and signi ﬁ cantly depending on the speci ﬁ c type of actin binding protein being manipulated . In addition , the thickness of the cortical actin was also shown to be a determinant of cortical tension independently of myosin and most interestingly , the relationship between cortical thickness and tension was found to be non - monotonic with maximum tension generated at medium cortical stiffness ( Chugh et al . , 2017 ) . It is expected , therefore , that changes in the expression levels of multiple actin binding proteins that regulate actin architecture have signi ﬁ cant impacts on cortical tension and further systematic studies are needed to elucidate the roles of different actin binding proteins in cortical contractility and stiffness . 2 . 3 Vimentin intermediate ﬁ laments In addition to actin ﬁ laments , vimentin ﬁ laments were also shown to contribute to the viscoelastic properties of several cell types , including endothelial cells but its contribution is more subtle ( Wang and Stamenovic , 2000 ; Mendez et al . , 2014 ) . Using magnetic twisting cytometry , it was shown that disrupting intermediate ﬁ laments with acrylamide results in softening in capillary endothelial cells , even though the effect appears to be milder than that of F - actin disruption ( Wang and Stamenovic , 2000 ) . A similar effect was also observed in vimentin - de ﬁ cient ﬁ broblasts ( Wang and Stamenovic , 2000 ; Mendez et al . , 2014 ) . The loss of vimentin was also shown to reduce cell elasticity and increase heterogeneity of the viscoelastic properties , which led to a hypothesis that vimentin has a protective role in maintaining cellular biomechanical phenotype , particularly when exposed to mechanical stresses ( Mendez et al . , 2014 ) . Most recently , wild - type and vimentin - null mouse embryonic ﬁ broblasts were utilized to study the protective effects of vimentin on the nucleus . Notably , it was demonstrated that the loss of vimentin causes signi ﬁ cant nuclear deformations , and vimentin − / − cells were approximately 20 % softer in the perinuclear region than the wild - type counterparts ( Patteson et al . , 2019 ) . Rescue with vimentin overexpression of the vimentin − / − cells restored nuclear shape and perinuclear stiffness , further solidifying the protective role of vimentin and it is contribution to cell stiffness . Additionally , oncogenes have been shown to alter the spatial organization of vimentin , and changes in oncogene expression lead to speci ﬁ c changes in vimentin con ﬁ guration ( without altering other cytoskeletal components ) , which in turn leads to changes in cell stiffness ( Rathje et al . , 2014 ) . Lamins are a group of type V intermediate ﬁ laments , which have been a focus of cell stiffness related studies for the past decade . Brie ﬂ y , the nucleoskeletal protein lamin a / c increases in a scaled manner with matrix / tissue stiffness and contributes to nuclear stiffness and cell stiffness at the perinuclear region ( Swift et al . , 2013 ; Srivastava et al . , 2021 ) . Although a few rudimentary studies have been performed to assess cell stiffness when microtubules are disrupted ( Hobson et al . , 2020 ) , the role of microtubules in cell stiffness remains relatively unexplored . In conclusion , the current state of knowledge is that endothelial stiffness depends primarily on actomyosin - mediated contractility with emerging roles of actin architecture and crosslinking and possibly of vimentin and lamin intermediate ﬁ laments ( Figure 1 ) . Frontiers in Physiology frontiersin . org 03 Aguilar et al . 10 . 3389 / fphys . 2022 . 1081119 3 Endothelial stiffening in response to mechanical signals Endothelial lining of the blood vessels is continuously exposed to mechanical loads : ﬂ uid shear stress , a frictional force generated by the blood ﬂ ow , hydrostatic pressure generated by blood pressure , and circumferential cyclic stretch during constriction / relaxation cycles of the arteries ( Figure 2 ) . Endothelium also experiences signi ﬁ cant changes in the sub - endothelial stiffness , as a result of vascular remodeling in different disease state and during aging . 3 . 1 Fluid shear stress Shear stress is well known to be one of the primary factors in endothelial function with laminar unidirectional ﬂ ow being anti - in ﬂ ammatory and disturbed non - unidirectional ﬂ ow being pro - in ﬂ ammatory ( Davies et al . , 2005 ; Grady et al . , 2016 ) . It is also well - known that unidirectional ﬂ ow is atheroprotective while the non - unidirectional ﬂ ow predisposes the arterial regions to atherosclerosis development . Noteworthy , disturbed ﬂ ow is also an aging factor and induces premature aging ( Hahn and Schwartz , 2009 ) . 3 . 2 Laminar unidirectional ﬂ ow Numerous studies have shown that exposure of endothelial cells to laminar ﬂ ow results in the formation of thick actin stress aligned in the direction of ﬂ ow ( Grady et al . , 2016 ; Dominic et al . , 2020 ) . A transition from the static culture to laminar ﬂ ow was also shown to induce endothelial stiffening , as estimated ﬁ rst by micropipette aspiration FIGURE 1 Cytoskeletal determinants of cellular viscoelastic properties : F - actin stress ﬁ bers ( left top panel ) , cortical actin ( middle top panel ) and vimentin intermediate ﬁ laments ( right top panel ) . The top left panel displays a 3D render of F - actin stress ﬁ bers ( yellow ) and nuclei ( blue ) from endothelial cells undergoing alignment following exposure to laminar ﬂ ow . These ﬁ bers also containnon - muscle myosin and underlie cellular contractility , which has amajor contribution to endothelial biomechanics . The middle panel shows an endothelial cell with a strong cortical / junctional F - actin network ( green ) and nuclei ( blue ) , which was also found to contribute to passive biomechanical properties of endothelial cells . The right panel shows an endothelial cell ’ s nuclei ( blue ) , and vimentin intermediate ﬁ lament network ( red ) which has a smaller but still signi ﬁ cant contribution to endothelial biomechanics . The width of the arrows conveys the degree of the contribution of the particular cytoskeleton element to endothelial viscoelastic properties . The contributions of these elements to endothelial stiffness are described in Sections 2 and Section 6 of the manuscript . FIGURE 2 Mechanical forces that regulate endothelial stiffening : 1 ) stretch generated by contraction / relaxation of the arterial wall , 2 ) ﬂ uid shear stress , a frictional force generated by the blood ﬂ ow , and 3 ) hydrostatic pressure . The mechanisms involved in the effects of the three forces on endothelial stiffness are described in Section 3 of the manuscript . Frontiers in Physiology frontiersin . org 04 Aguilar et al . 10 . 3389 / fphys . 2022 . 1081119 ( Sato et al . , 1987 ; Davies , 1995 ) and then by the indentation - based Atomic Force Microscopy ( Sato et al . , 1996 ; Sato et al . , 2000 ) . Interestingly , upon the transition from static to laminar shear stress conditions , the stiffening response develops ﬁ rst in the part of the front edge of the cell that faces the ﬂ ow in non - monolayer cell cultures and then later equilibrates to the rest of the cell ( Sato et al . , 1996 ) . Mechanistically , laminar shear stress is known to activate RhoA GTPases , speci ﬁ cally , RhoA and Rac ( Tzima et al . , 2001 ; Ohashi et al . , 2002 ; Tzima et al . , 2002 ) , both key regulators of actin cytoskeleton dynamics and architecture ( Hall 1998 ; Wojciak - Stothard and Ridley , 2003 ; Hall , 2012 ; Ridley , 2015 ) . As described above , activation of RhoA induces formation of actin stress ﬁ bers and activation of endothelial contractile response , whereas activation of Rac promotes formation of cortical actin and lamellipodia growth ( Wojciak - Stothard and Ridley , 2003 ; Hall , 2012 ; Ridley , 2015 ) . Activation of RhoA by laminar shear stress was shown to be biphasic , with a transient decrease of RhoA activity at the initiation of the ﬂ ow , followed by an enhanced activity ( Tzima et al . , 2002 ) . This biphasic response , coupled with the activation of Rac was proposed to be essential for ﬂ ow - induced endothelial alignment : a transient decrease in Rho activity inhibits myosin - dependent contractility and disassembly of the stress ﬁ bers , allowing endothelial cells to change shape and grow lamellipodia in the direction of the ﬂ ow , which is mediated by Rac at the edge of the cells downstream of the ﬂ ow ; then , the delayed phase of Rho activation strengthens and stabilizes the new cell shape and alignment by the formation of shear stress ﬁ bers in the direction of the ﬂ ow ( Civelekoglu - Scholey et al . , 2005 ) . 3 . 3 Disturbed non - unidirectional ﬂ ow Physiologically , however , a more relevant question is not what happens when cells maintained under static conditions are exposed to ﬂ ow but whether laminar and disturbed ﬂ ows have distinct effects on endothelial stiffness . Again , it is very well - known that the architecture of the cytoskeleton is vastly different in cells exposed to unidirectional / laminar and non - unidirectional / disturbed ﬂ ow : while as described above , laminar ﬂ ow induces formation actin stress ﬁ bers aligned in the direction of ﬂ ow , exposure to disturbed ﬂ ow results in abundant stress ﬁ bers without clear orientation or direction . In terms of endothelial stiffness , however , studies from our lab showed no difference in the elastic properties of endothelial cells , as measured by the AFM , when cells were exposed to the two types of ﬂ ow , unless the cells were also exposed to oxidized low - density lipoproteins ( oxLDL ) ( LeMaster et al . , 2018 ) . The mechanisms and the physiological implications of oxLDL - induced endothelial stiffening and its dependence on the hemodynamic environment are described in detail later in this review . Stretch was also shown in earlier studies to induce endothelial stiffening , which was attributed to an increase in cytoskeleton tension ( Pourati et al . , 1998 ) . It was also shown that cyclic biaxial mechanical stretch results remodeling of adherens junctions from linear to zipper - like , which is a known characteristic of junction under tension and in the up - regulation of myosin light chain - 2 ( pMLC2 ) phosphorylation , which as described above is indicative of increased actomyosin contractility , and increase in cell stiffness ( Miroshnikova et al . , 2021 ) . Furthermore , it was shown that the process is biphasic , with the initial contractile response driven by the in ﬂ ux of Ca 2 + via stretch - sensitive Piezo1 channels leading to the activation of Rho - GTPases , and the second phase driven by phosphorylation of actin cross - linker proteins ﬁ lamins ( Miroshnikova et al . , 2021 ) . Hydrostatic pressure was also shown to induce an increase in endothelial stiffness . In an in vitro model of short - term ( 24 h ) high pressure exposure , aortic ECs underwent signi ﬁ cant structural changes , speci ﬁ cally formation of stress ﬁ bers , as identi ﬁ ed by phalloidin staining suggesting an increase in cellular stiffness ( Ohashi et al . , 2007 ) . Computational modeling of stress ﬁ ber networks in pulmonary microvascular ECs suggested that stress ﬁ ber stiffness ( speci ﬁ cally bending stiffness ) contributes to the generation of pressure - induced cellular high strain levels ( Ito et al . , 2010 ) . Furthermore , inducing strain in these cells in culture using a uni - axial stretching apparatus , which was predicted to increase cell strain , resulted in stress ﬁ ber formation , which was dependent on the activation of stretch - activated cation channels ( Ito et al . , 2010 ) . More recently , signi ﬁ cant endothelial stiffening was observed in response to increased hydrostatic pressure generated by a custom - made small volume pressurized chamber that allows exposing live cells to controlled pressure ( Prystopiuk et al . , 2018 ) . The stiffening was observed in response to both acute ( 1 h ) and chronic ( 24 h ) hydrostatic pressures of 100 mm Hg ( 13 kPa ) , with stiffening still observed 1 hour post recovery in cells exposed to chronic high pressure exposure . The stiffening response was accompanied by the increase of retraction velocity of cortical ﬁ laments and abrogated by inhibiting myosin II phosphorylation with blebbistatin , both indicating that it is mediated by myosin II - dependent contraction . The high pressure - induced endothelial stiffening was also abrogated by blocking mechanosensitive cation channels and blocking or downregulation ENaC sodium channels . The authors conclude that hydrostatic pressure induced endothelial contractile response via Ca 2 + in ﬂ ux through mechanosensitive ion channels and Ca 2 + - mediated activation of myosin . There are also studies that suggest that generation of intracellular pressure may result in cell stiffening . Beyder and Sachs ( 2009 ) showed that the application of hydrostatic pressure through a micropipette directly to the cell interior in a whole - cell patch con ﬁ guration results in a decrease in membrane deformability , which indicates membrane stiffening . Consistent with this study , we found that hypotonic challenge results in endothelial stiffening , which was not abolished but rather enhanced by the depolymerization of actin cytoskeleton , which led us to hypothesize that the stiffening is a result of an increased hydrostatic pressure that develops from osmotic in ﬂ ux into the cells ( Ayee et al . , 2018 ) . 3 . 4 Extracellular matrix stiffness Extracellular matrix is a highly heterogenous milieu of interconnecting ﬁ bers that provides mechanical support for all tissues . It is well established that cells sense the stiffness of the ECM and respond to it in multiple ways that include changes in cellular biomechanical properties . In what is considered an adaptive response to the ECM stiffening , cell undergo changes in the cytoskeletal structure to reinforce the internal scaffold by increase in stress ﬁ ber formation and activation of myosin - mediated contractility , which in turn increases cellular cortical stiffness ( Wang et al . , 2020 ; Yi et al . , 2022 ) . The balance between the ECM stiffness and the cytoskeletal stiffness / tension is believed to be required to maintain cell shape and adhesion to the substrate . The stiffness of Frontiers in Physiology frontiersin . org 05 Aguilar et al . 10 . 3389 / fphys . 2022 . 1081119 the matrix was also shown to determine stem cell lineage to different fates with cell stiffnesses of the differentiated cells to match the elasticity of the substrate ( Engler et al . , 2006 ) . Mechanistically , stiff substrates lead to increased binding of integrins to the extracellular matrix , increased expression of the component of the focal adhesion , and activation of focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , which in turn activates RhoA / myosin - induced contractility ( Discher et al . , 2005 ; Yeung et al . , 2005 ) . Thus , stiffer substrates generate increased cytoskeleton tension , which manifests itself in increased cellular cortical stiffness . Our earlier studies demonstrated that substrate stiffness also leads to increased stiffness of endothelial cells , both in 2D and in 3D environments ( By ﬁ eld et al . , 2009 ) . To test the impact of substrate stiffness in a 2D culture , endothelial cells are grown on polyacrylamide gels with elastic moduli between ~ 1 . 5 and 10 kPa , a typical range of stiffness in arteries ( Woodrum et al . , 2006 ; Le Master et al . , 2018 ) , which led to ~ 2 fold increase in endothelial cells , as estimated by micropipette aspiration technique ( By ﬁ eld et al . , 2009 ) . A similar stiffening effect was also observed when endothelial cells were embedded in 3D collagen gels to mimic migration of cells into a tissue , which occurs during formation of new vessels . It was subsequently shows that growing endothelial cells on stiffer substrates also increases endothelial force generation , as assessed by force traction microscopy , an effect that was abrogated by the inhibition or downregulation of Rho - associated kinase , ROCK ( Huynh et al . , 2011 ; Krishnan et al . , 2011 ) . Also , more recently and consistent with the previous studies , it was shown that on soft anisotropic scaffolds endothelial cells form actin ﬁ laments aligning with the direction of the substrate ﬁ bers and organized into cortical bands , while on stiffer scaffolds , the cells formed stress ﬁ bers spanning the entire cell , which is typical for higher contractile state ( Yi et al . , 2020 ) . Thus , it is abundantly clear that endothelial stiffness and contractility increase when cells are exposed to stiffer extracellular milieu . 3 . 5 Cell stiffness may modulate the mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix It is also important to note that the crosstalk between substrate and cellular stiffness is bidirectional : not only increased substrate stiffness provides mechanical cues for cells to stiffen but also cellular traction forces induce remodeling of the matrix . Speci ﬁ cally , it was shown that MLC - dependent cell traction forces are involved in the remodeling of collagen by binding the ﬁ bers to protruding lamellipodia and then retracting ( Meshel et al . , 2005 ) . RhoA / ROCK activation was also shown to induce the assembly of ﬁ bronectin ﬁ bers by tension - induced exposure of cryptic sites ( Zhong et al . , 1998 ) and also by the cytoskeletal tension that is transmitted to the extracellular environment via integrins ( Singh et al . , 2010 ) . Furthermore , an increased rigidity of the substrate promotes the formation of ﬁ brillar ﬁ brinogen matrix ( Carraher and Schwarzbauer , 2013 ) , consistent with the increased activation of RhoA and increased cortical tension on stiffer substrates described above . Formation of a mature detergent - insoluble ﬁ brinogen matrix contributes to tissue stability and rigidity , as well as serves as a scaffold for the deposition of other components of extracellular matrix including collagen , which further increase the rigidity / stiffness of the tissue ( Singh et al . , 2010 ) . Together , these mechanisms provide a bidirectional regulation of tissue / cellular stiffness . 4 Endothelial stiffening in response to oxidized lipids Studies of our group focused over the last decade on the impact of cholesterol and oxidized lipids on endothelial stiffness and contractility . In an early study by By ﬁ eld et al . ( 2004 ) , we established that in contrast to a lipid bilayer that stiffens as a result of the increase in membrane cholesterol , endothelial cells became less deformable / more stiff when cellular cholesterol was depleted using a cyclic oligosaccharide , methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( M β CD ) with high - af ﬁ nity to cholesterol . The stiffening effect of M β CD was determined by micropipette aspiration , an effect that can be reversed upon repletion with membrane cholesterol . The stiffening effect induced by cholesterol depletion was fully abrogated by disruption of F - actin with latrunculin - A ( a macrolide which prevents actin polymerization ) , suggesting that depleting cholesterol increases cell stiffness by altering F - actin and its structural relationship with the cell membrane . Indeed , in a later study , we found that cholesterol depletion signi ﬁ cantly increases the adhesion energy between the membrane and the underlying cytoskeleton , while cholesterol enrichment had the opposite effect , as was determined by pulling membrane nanotubes using AFM ( Sun et al . , 2007 ) . This observation was also unexpected because depleting membrane cholesterol is well - known to disrupt the signaling platforms termed lipid rafts , which are the focal points of membrane - cytoskeletal interactions ( Levitan and Gooch , 2007 ) . Consistent with these ﬁ ndings , cholesterol depletion was also found to result in an increase in cytoskeletal traction forces and focal adhesions ( Norman et al . , 2010 ) . These paradoxical relationships between the effects of cholesterol on stiffness of the lipid bilayer and on cellular biomechanics , which is dominated by the cytoskeleton , are discussed in details in our earlier review ( Ayee and Levitan , 2016 ) . The physiological signi ﬁ cance , however , of endothelial stiffening induced by cholesterol depletion is not really clear . We turned , therefore , to study the effects of oxidized lipids , such as oxidated modi ﬁ cations of low - density lipoproteins ( oxLDL ) , whose major impact on endothelial function and cardiovascular disease is well established ( Levitan et al . , 2010 ) . In terms of the relationship between oxLDL and cellular cholesterol , while it has been generally believed that oxLDL loads cells with cholesterol , this notion is controversial , as several studies , found that exposure to oxLDL actually does not load endothelial cells with cholesterol , but instead results in signi ﬁ cant cellular increase in oxysterols ( By ﬁ eld et al . , 2006 ; Shentu et al . , 2010 ; Ayee and Levitan , 2021 ) . Furthermore , this effect is not unique to endothelial cells , as a similar phenomenon was recently reported in macrophages ( Rezende et al . , 2022 ) . There are also interesting similarities between the effects of oxLDL and exposure and M β CD : in both cases , in addition to causing endothelial stiffening , both oxLDL and M β CD resulted in the internalization of a lipid raft marker GM1 protein , an increase in endothelial force generation and network formation ( By ﬁ eld et al . , 2006 ) , as well as facilitates the alignment of endothelial cells to ﬂ ow ( Kowalsky et al . , 2008 ) . These observations indicated that exposure to oxLDL leads to functional / Frontiers in Physiology frontiersin . org 06 Aguilar et al . 10 . 3389 / fphys . 2022 . 1081119 biomechanical effects similar to cholesterol depletion rather than cholesterol enrichment . To further investigate the biophysical basis of this phenomenon , we assessed the degree of lipid order of the plasma membrane using Laurdan imaging , a dye that is sensitive to the presence of water dipoles in the membrane and thus is used to assess lipid order ( Levitan and Shentu , 2011 ; Levitan , 2021 ) . We found that similarly to cholesterol depletion , exposing cells to oxLDL resulted in the disruption of the lipid order , as indicated by a signi ﬁ cant shift in the lipid order of the membrane lipid bilayer to a less ordered state ( Shentu et al . , 2010 ) . In terms of speci ﬁ c lipid species that cause lipid disorder and endothelial stiffening , we found that these effects can be mediated either by oxysterols of by oxidized phospholipids and are a result of the tilt of the speci ﬁ c lipid molecules within the lipid bilayer ( Shentu et al . , 2012 ; Ayee et al . , 2017a ; Ayee and Levitan , 2021 ) . It is also important to note that subtle increases in the amount of oxysterols that are consistent with the elevation of these species under dyslipidemic conditions are suf ﬁ cient to cause signi ﬁ cant molecular - scale biophysical perturbations of the membrane structure resulting in increased cellular stiffness ( Ayee and Levitan , 2021 ) . We also established that oxidized lipids induce endothelial stiffening by activating the RhoA / ROCK pathway and formation of stress ﬁ bers ( Oh et al . , 2016 ) , which is well - known to induce cell stiffening , as described above ( Figure 3 ) . Noteworthy , an increased uptake of oxLDL under disturbed ﬂ ow conditions leads to differential stiffening of endothelial cells exposed to laminar and disturbed ﬂ ow and is also responsible for endothelial stiffening in the aortic arch in vivo ( LeMaster et al . , 2018 ) . 5 Endothelial stiffening in aging and cardiovascular disease While numerous studies demonstrated that aging and development of the cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , such as hypertension and atherosclerosis , are accompanied with arterial stiffening , as determined by pulse wave velocity ( Laurent et al . , 2001 ; Mitchell et al . , 2007 ; Mitchell , 2008 ; Palombo and Kozakova , 2016 ) , which measures the rigidity of the arterial wall , as a whole ( Armentano and Cymberknop , 2019 ) , only few studies directly evaluated the impact of aging or CVD on the stiffness of the arterial endothelial layer . Huyn et al . ( 2011 ) provided an indirect evidence for age - related endothelial stiffening by demonstrating that denuded aortas ( aortas in which endothelium is removed ) of aged mice ( 20 – 25 months old ) are signi ﬁ cantly stiffer than denuded aortas of young mice ( 2 – 3 months old ) and that this increase in sub - endothelial stiffness correlated with RhoA / ROCK - dependent disruption of the endothelial barrier . More recently , our studies demonstrated directly that endothelial monolayer of intact aortas is signi ﬁ cantly stiffer in aortas isolated from aged mice ( > 10 months old ) , as compared to younger animals ( 3 – 6 months ) ( Le Master et al . , 2018 ) . Noteworthy , our recent study established that endothelial elastic modulus of aortas remains stable up until 6 months of age and then sharply increases in mice 10 – 12 months of age , representing “ middle age ” with further increase in the advanced aged animals ( Le Master et al . , 2022 ) . Endothelial stiffening was also reported to accompany age - related macular degeneration in rhesus macaque ( Cabrera et al . , 2022 ) . Thus , an increase in endothelial stiffness FIGURE 3 Oxidized lipids that induce endothelial stiffening : The top panels ( A , B ) show the structures of the major oxidized lipids that contribute to endothelial stiffening : a7 - ketocholesterol ( left ) and oxidized phospholipids , POVPC andPGPC ( right ) .

This is described in Section 4 of the manuscript . Frontiers in Physiology frontiersin . org 07 Aguilar et al . 10 . 3389 / fphys . 2022 . 1081119 with age is well documented but the mechanisms responsible for these effects are still being investigated ( Figure 4 ) . 5 . 1 Endothelial stiffening as a secondary effect to arterial stiffening The most well - studied , “ canonical ” mechanism of endothelial stiffening is a response to mechanical cues generated by a stiff substrate suggesting that endothelial stiffening with age is a secondary effect to the arterial stiffening ( Tzima et al . , 2001 ) . Furthermore , the pathological consequences of age - related arterial stiffening are proposed to be attributed to the increased contractility / stiffening of the endothelium , which in turn is known to disrupt the junctional integrity of the endothelial monolayer ( Huynh et al . , 2011 ; Krishnan et al . , 2011 ; Kohn et al . , 2015b ) . This concept is based on two well - established phenomena , described above : 1 ) increased stiffness of the arterial wall with age , accompanied with endothelial stiffening , observed in vivo and 2 ) stiffening of endothelial cells grown on stiff substrates in vitro , which makes the connection between the two very logical but it is dif ﬁ cult to establish the causality between the two in aged vessels in vivo , as other factors may also play important roles , as will be discussed in the next sections . 5 . 2 Endothelial stiffening as a result of exposure to dyslipidemia Our recent studies established that feeding mice high fat diet ( HFD ) leads to an increase in the elastic modulus of endothelium in intact mouse aortas , which mechanistically is mediated by the scavenger receptor CD36 ( LeMaster et al . , 2018 ) , well - known to mediate the uptake of oxLDL and fatty acids ( Silverstein and Febbraio , 2009 ) . Surprisingly , and in contrast to existing paradigms , we discovered that global deletion of CD36 abrogates endothelial stiffening in mouse aortas of aged mice while having no effect on sub - endothelial stiffness suggesting that endothelial stiffening is driven by lipid uptake rather than substrate stiffness ( Le Master et al . , 2018 ) . We also found that global deletion of caveolin - 1 ( Cav1 ) , scaffolding protein required for the formation of caveolae , the primary mechanism of endocytosis of macromolecules into endothelial cells ( Cohen et al . , 2004 ; Jones and Minshall , 2020 ) and a known regulator of CD36 expression ( Frank et al . , 2004 ) , results in the attenuation of endothelial stiffening in aortas of aged mice ( Le Master et al . , 2022 ) . Thus , endothelial stiffening may not be secondary to arterial stiffening , as has been proposed in earlier studies , but may develop independently as a result of uptake and accumulation of oxidized lipids . FIGURE 4 Endothelial stiffening and aging . The top left panel displays a diagram of an endothelial cell ’ s mechanotransduction process from the ECM ( depicted as short crosslines outside of the basal side of a cell ) to the focal adhesions / integrins ( blue double - sided arrows ) to cytoskeletal networks ( intracellular light purple bundles ) . For a stiffer arterial wall and therefore stiffer ECM , this mechanotransduction leads to more F - actin stress ﬁ ber activity and stiffer cells . The right top panel displays an alternate process of stiffening caused by disturbed ﬂ ow and CD36 / Cav1 mediated uptake of oxLDL ( CD36 is shown schematically as a red integral protein , that is bound to Caveolin - 1 at the inner lea ﬂ et of the membrane , shown in blue , oxLDL bound to CD36 is shown in green and oxysterols incorporated into the bilayer are shown in yellow / red ) .

Frontiers in Physiology frontiersin . org 08 Aguilar et al . 10 . 3389 / fphys . 2022 . 1081119 6 Relationship between endothelial stiffening and barrier function Endothelial barrier integrity is modulated at the cell - cell interface by a variety of junctional factors , key among them proteins that stabilize anchors to a network of cortical actin bundles , the major element of the sub - membrane cytoskeleton ( Garcia - Ponce et al . , 2015 ; Karki and Birukov , 2019 ) . The function of the barrier is to provide control of entry across the endothelial layer , offering protection against the entry of pathological factors while also providing control over extravasation of immune cells , such as leukocytes , into the vascular wall . Maintaining the integrity of the endothelial barrier relies on several variants of cell - cell junctions , the two main types of junctions are adherens junctions ( AJs ) , and tight junctions ( TJs ) ( Hartsock and Nelson , 2008 ; Tietz and Engelhardt , 2015 ; Adil et al . , 2021 ) . Adherens junctions consist of a complex of VE - cadherin , p120 - catenin , and β - catenin linked to the cortical actin bundles located under the plasma membrane through association with N - WASP , ZO proteins , vinculin , among others . The key proteins of the tight junction are claudin and occludin and they are linked to cortical actin bundles via zona occludens ( ZO ) proteins . AJs are more numerous than TJs in the endothelial barrier interface . The maintenance of the endothelial barrier and the stability of AJs / TJs critically depend on the organization and biomechanical features of the cytoskeleton , which might both reinforce the stability of the barrier or pull the junctions apart . In general , formation of cortical actin bundles , the sub - membrane cytoskeletal layer , connected to AJs / TJs reinforces the barrier whereas formation of contractile stress ﬁ bers , radial ﬁ bers that run across the cell and are normal to endothelial cell - cell interface , disrupt the barrier . Multiple studies have shown that activation of Rac1 , a Rho - GTPase , that facilitate formation of cortical actin stabilizes and reinforces endothelial barrier , whereas activation of RhoA , a Rho - GTPase , that induce formation of contractile stress ﬁ bers via a phosphorylation cascade that phosphorylates Myosin II disrupts the barrier ( Belvitch et al . , 2018 ; Karki and Birukov , 2019 ; Wettschureck et al . , 2019 ) . Radial stress ﬁ bers pull on intercellular complexes of AJs and TJs via p120 / β - catenin and ZO proteins respectively . In terms of endothelial stiffening , in theory , both formation of cortical actin and the contractile response may manifest themselves as increased cell stiffness / decreased deformability . Typically , however , endothelial stiffening is response to multiple environmental challenges was found to be mediated by RhoA - induced contractile response . As discussed in detail in the earlier sections of this review , activation of RhoA with subsequent phosphorylation of myosin and increased contractile response were found to underlie endothelial stiffening in response to hemodynamic forces , increased stiffness of the substrate and oxidized lipids . In one of our earlier studies , we evaluated the relative contributions of RhoA and Rac1 to oxLDL - induced stiffening and found that it entirely depends on RhoA and independent of Rac1 ( Oh et al . , 2016 ) . Based on these observations , it is expected that endothelial stiffening is likely to be barrier disruptive . Several studies have illustrated a direct association between endothelial stiffening and barrier disruption . Stroka et al . ( 2012 ) showed an increased contractility via MLCK phosphorylation , an enzyme that phosphorylates myosin II , to correlate directly with an increase in transvasation of neutrophils providing an early evidence for the role of contractile force generation in barrier disruption . A clear correlation between increased endothelial stiffness , as assessed by AFM , and an increase in transendothelial permeability assessed by electrical resistance ( TEER ) was shown in lung microvascular endothelial cells in response to thrombin in vitro ( Suresh et al . , 2019 ) . This is consistent with the known effect of thrombin on RhoA activation and inducing stress ﬁ ber formation ( Takeya et al . , 2008 ; Giri et al . , 2022 ) . Interestingly , the authors also found that caspase - 3 , a protease primarily associated with programmed cell death ( Asadi et al . , 2022 ) , partially prevents both the stiffening and the barrier disruption . Rokhzan et al . ( 2019 ) further characterized the impact of thrombin on endothelial contractile response in dermal microvascular endothelial cells by employing epi ﬂ uorescence traction mapping to generate quantitative maps of force distribution within the endothelial cells , a method called Force Traction Microscopy ( Wang and Lin , 2007 ) and showed that thrombin increased transendothelial permeability ( TEER ) in tandem with increases in contractile forces across the monolayer . The authors also showed , however , that contractile forces are not the only factor regulating the integrity of the barrier , as they were able to strengthen the barrier by treating the cells with angiopoietin - 1 , which increases VE - cadherin expression but has no effect on the contractile response . The association between endothelial stiffening and barrier disruption was observed in a variety of clinical conditions , including hypertension and in ﬂ ammation . Speci ﬁ cally , pressure - induced endothelial stiffening was accompanied by barrier disruption , as was assessed through two methods : TEER and neutrophil extravasation . The barrier disruption was observed in response to chronic high pressure , as manifested by an increase in TEER permeability , increased neutrophil extravasation , and discontinuous VE - cadherin . Similarly , induction of long - term ( 7 – 10 days ) hyperglycemia in vitro results in the generation of radial stress ﬁ bers and cortical stiffening in endothelial cells , accompanied with a gap generations between the cells , as visualized by imaging of ﬂ uorescent actin , indicative of barrier disruption ( Targosz - Korecka et al . , 2013 ) . Furthermore , after cells were returned to normoglycemic conditions for several days , both endothelial stiffness and barrier integrity improved in parallel even though some stiffening and gaps persisted . Endothelial stiffening was also observed in response to lipopolysaccharide or TNF α in ﬂ ammatory signals with stiff stress ﬁ bers identi ﬁ ed both by staining and by AFM mapping and 2D rendering ( Okamoto et al . , 2020 ) . In this study , the integrity of adherens junctions was not evaluated but interestingly they showed that endothelial stiffening is accompanied with decreased functionality of the gap junctions , inter - cellular channels that allow passage of intracellular small molecules between adjacent cells suggesting that endothelial stiffening affects cell - cell communication / interaction via several mechanisms . The mechanism behind endothelial stiffening / contractile - driven degeneration of the barrier is still not fully understood and continues to be studied . Several lines of evidence suggest contractile actin stress ﬁ bers apply tension on the elements of the adherens junctions resulting in the destabilization of the multiprotein complex ( Figure 5 ) . An early study of Birukova et al . ( 2012 ) demonstrated that a contractile response correlates with the phosphorylation of VE - cadherin , and its subsequent internalization away from the barrier interface , suggesting that mechanical forces may cause the loss of membrane expression of the major junctional proteins . A more detailed mechanism emerged from more recent studies that evaluated the effects of tension on the conformation state of VE - Frontiers in Physiology frontiersin . org 09 Aguilar et al . 10 . 3389 / fphys . 2022 . 1081119 cadherin complex . Kugelmann et al . , 2018 demonstrated that disruption of the endothelial barrier induced by thrombin or histamine is accompanied with the exposure of a tension - sensitive epitope of α - catenin , a linker protein that connects VE - cadherin complex to the actin cytoskeleton ( Meng and Takeichi , 2009 ) . The role of α - catenin in force - induced reorganization of the junctions was discovered in an earlier study by Yonemura et al . , 2010 who showed that tension force applied by actin ﬁ bers to the C - terminus of α - catenin results in the change of α - catenin conformation or unwinding to expose a vinculin - binding region . Yonemura et al . ( 2010 ) also generated a tension - sensitive α - catenin antibody that binds to the epitope of α - catenin exposed in response to tension . Using this tension - sensitive α - catenin antibody , Kugelmann et al . ( 2018 ) showed that tension on α - catenin develops simultaneously with endothelial barrier disruption , as estimated by both imaging VE - cadherin organization / jaggedness and TEER . Inhibition of the ROCK activity during stimulation with thrombin / histamine abrogated tensional force generation on α 18 - catenin , demonstrating that RhoA / ROCK signaling is essential to eliciting direct tensional force on VE - cadherin complexes . They did not observe any signi ﬁ cant change in vinculin distribution , however , suggesting the role of α - catenin tension may have a more general effect on the reorganization of adherens junctions beyond the association with vinculin . Interestingly , Kugelmann et al . ( 2018 ) found that as tensional force on α 18 - catenin increases , there is increased translocation of RhoA , as assessed by FRET , to the cell border , which might further contribute to increased tension . In addition , they found that chelation of Ca 2 + during stimulation with thrombin or histamine abrogate tensional force generation on α 18 - catenin and histamine - induced RhoA activation , demonstrating that Ca 2 + mediated RhoA / ROCK signaling is essential to eliciting direct tensional force on VE - cadherin complexes of the endothelial barrier . Another direct link between actomyosin contractile response and disruption of adherens junctions was found by Arif et al . , 2021 who demonstrated that tension generated by actin ﬁ bers result in unmasking a VE - cadherin phosphorylation site , tyrosine 731 , that is masked by catenin under resting conditions . This unmasking is also accompanied by tension developing within VE - cadherin itself , as indicated by a tension FRET sensor . Most importantly , unmaking of tyrosine 731 makes it accessible for SHP2 phosphatase , which FIGURE 5 Aschematicrepresentationoftheregulationoftheendothelialbarrierbythemechanicalpropertiesofendothelialcells : Inthetoppanelweillustratethe barrier that couples adjacent endothelial cells . The endothelialbarrier between adjacentcells provides a method for the controlled passage of molecules into the vascular wall . This barrier is primarily composed of tight junctions ( composed of occludens and claudins ) and adherens junctions ( composed of VE - cadherin and catenins ) . The endothelial barrier maintains its integrity with scaffolding support from cortical actin ﬁ bers . In the bottom panel we illustrate theprocessthroughwhichbarrierdisruptionisinduced , suchasduringin ﬂ ammation . Via RhoA - dependentgenerationofF - actinstress ﬁ bernetworks , barrier degeneration is accomplished through force - based uncoupling of junctional proteins , leading to their sequestration , and facilitating gap formation between adjacent cells . A detailed explanation into the role of RhoA - dependent F - actin stress ﬁ ber networks in barrier degeneration is provided in Section 6 of the manuscript . Frontiers in Physiology frontiersin . org 10 Aguilar et al . 10 . 3389 / fphys . 2022 . 1081119 results in its dephosphorylation and subsequent VE - cadherin internalization . Activation of SHP2 is induced by leukocyte binding to endothelial cells through PECAM1 , a known endothelial mechanosensory . It is thus , possible , that tension plays a dual role in the disruption of the barrier and diapedesis of leukocytes across the endothelial layer : unmasking VE - cadherin phosphorylation site by actin - mediated contractile forces and activation of SHP2 by tension - induced activation of PECAM1 . 7 Concluding remarks and future directions Multiple studies demonstrated that endothelial cells stiffen in response to mechanical and soluble factors . The most well - studied and the dominant mechanism of endothelial stiffening is RhoA / Myosin - dependent formation of actin stress ﬁ bers and contractile response . There is also accumulating amount of evidence showing that cortical actin and intermediate ﬁ laments may contribute to endothelial stiffening but the relative contributions of these mechanisms to endothelial stiffening in response to physiological or pathological stimuli is still not well understood . This review also presents our current understanding on the contribution of mechanical signals towards endothelial stiffening . Consistent with the dominant role of RhoA - induced stress ﬁ ber formation , this mechanism is induced by the mechanical signals , which include ﬂ uid shear stress , stretch and increase in matrix stiffness . It is important to note , however , that the same signals also induce Rac1 activation , which has an inverse relationship with RhoA , and further evidence is required to understand the biphasic role of RhoA / Rac1 activation and the mechanism driving cell remodeling of the biophysical properties of extracellular matrix . Another important outstanding question is what is the differential response of the anti - in ﬂ ammatory unidirectional and pro - in ﬂ ammatory non - unidirectional ﬂ ow on endothelial stiffness . We also highlight the role of oxidized lipids in endothelial stiffening , which is relatively less studied and recognized . In this context , it is interesting to note that non - unidirectional ﬂ ow was shown to increase endothelial stiffness in oxLDL - dependent way , by enhancing oxLDL uptake and thus , oxLDL - induced endothelial stiffening . Furthermore , there is clear evidence that the uptake of oxidized lipids plays a key role in endothelial stiffening induced by high fat diet and by aging . The relative contributions and the crosstalk of mechanical and soluble lipid signals to endothelial stiffening under different pathological conditions need further study . Lastly , we focused on reviewing the role of endothelial stiffness in maintenance of the barrier integrity . While extensive research showed that RhoA - induced contractile stress ﬁ ber formation results in the disruption of the endothelial barrier , only few studies present direct evidence into the role of endothelial stiffening in barrier disruption induced by hyperglycemia , in ﬂ ammation , and high pressure . In addition , we present emerging evidence into the mechanism of RhoA - induced stress ﬁ ber formation in barrier disruption , a mechanism that shows that tensional force strength is a factor in eliciting the degeneration of adherens junction protein complexes . The role of endothelial stiffening into eliciting barrier disruption , specially that induced by aging or vascular disease , needs further study .
