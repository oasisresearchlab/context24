Understanding the different transmission routes of SARS - CoV - 2 is crucial in planning effective interventions to break the chain of transmission . Although extensive surface contamination with SARS - CoV - 2 by a symptomatic patient has been demon - strated 1 , little is known about airborne transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . It is also unknown if asymptomatic individuals pose the same environmental contamination risk as symptomatic ones , although viral shedding has been demonstrated to continue even after clinical recovery of COVID - 19 patients 2 . There are multiple reports of asymptomatic patients testing positive for SARS - CoV - 2 3 , 4 , and the potential transmission of the virus by an asymptomatic person has been described 5 . Therefore , viral con - tamination of the air and surfaces surrounding asymptomatic or recovering COVID - 19 patients could have serious implications for outbreak control strategies . This knowledge gap is recognized in the Report of the WHO - China Joint Mission on Coronavirus 2019 6 . The primary objective of our study is to identify potential patient - level risk factors for environmental contamination by SARS - CoV - 2 by sampling the air and surfaces surrounding hospitalized COVID - 19 patients at different stages of illness . Results Air and environmental sampling . Environmental sampling was conducted in three airborne infection isolation rooms ( AIIRs ) in the ICU and 27 AIIRs in the general ward . Air sampling was performed in three of the 27 AIIRs in the general ward . All patients reported COVID - 19 symptoms . Seven patients ( 23 % ) were asymptomatic at the time of environmental sampling . Of the 23 symptomatic patients , 18 ( 78 % ) had respiratory symptoms , 1 had gastrointestinal symptoms , 1 had both respiratory and gas - trointestinal symptoms , and 3 patients ( 10 % ) had fever or myalgia only ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Air samples from two ( 66 . 7 % ) of three AIIRs tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 , in particle sizes > 4 µm and 1 – 4 µm in diameter ( Table 1 ) . Samples from the fractionated size < 1 µm were all negative , as were all non - size - fractionated SKC polytetra ﬂ uor - oethylene ( PTFE ) ﬁ lter cassette samples . Total SARS - CoV - 2 concentrations in air ranged from 1 . 84 × 10 3 to 3 . 38 × 10 3 RNA copies per m 3 air sampled . Rooms with viral particles detected in the air also had surface contamination detected . There were no baseline differences between patients with environmental surface contamination and those without , in terms of age , comorbidities , and positive clinical sample on the day of sampling . Median cycle threshold ( Ct ) values of the clinical specimens for patients with and without environmental surface contamination were 25 . 69 ( IQR 20 . 37 – 34 . 48 ) and 33 . 04 ( 28 . 45 – 35 . 66 ) , respectively ( Table 2 ) . Of the rooms with environmental contamination , the ﬂ oor was most likely to be contaminated ( 65 % ) , followed by the air exhaust vent ( 60 % , n = 5 ) , bed rail ( 59 % ) , and bedside locker ( 47 % ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Contamination of toilet seat and automatic toilet ﬂ ush button was detected in 5 out of 27 rooms , and all 5 occupants had reported gastrointestinal symptoms within the preceding 1 week of sampling . We did not detect surface contamination in any of the three ICU rooms . Presence of environmental surface contamination was higher in week 1 of illness ( Fig . 2 ) and showed association with the clinical cyclical threshold ( P = 0 . 06 , Wilcoxon rank - sum test ) . Surface environment contamination was not associated with the presence of symptoms ( Table 2 ) . In a subgroup analysis , the presence and extent of high - touch surface contamination were signi ﬁ cantly higher in rooms of patients in their ﬁ rst week of illness ( Fig . 2 ) . The best ﬁ t curve with the least - squares ﬁ t ( Fig . 3 ) showed that the extent of high - touch surface contamination declined with increasing duration of illness and Ct values . There was also no correlation between the Ct values of clinical samples and the Ct values of environmental samples across the days of illness ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Discussion Surface sampling revealed that the PCR - positivity high - touch surfaces was associated with nasopharyngeal viral loads and peaked at approximately day 4 – 5 of symptoms . Air sampling of the AIIR environments of two COVID - 19 patients ( both day 5 of illness with high nasopharyngeal swab viral loads ) detected the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 particles sized 1 – 4 µm and > 4 µm . The absence of any detection of SARS - CoV - 2 in air samples of the third patient ( day 9 of illness with lower nasopharyngeal viral load concentration ) suggests that the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 in the air is possibly highest in the ﬁ rst week of illness . Recent aggregated environmental sampling and laboratory experiments have examined the particle size distribution of Table 1 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) detections in the air of hospital rooms of infected patient .

ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 16670 - 2 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 2800 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 16670 - 2 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications SARS - CoV - 2 in the air . A study from Wuhan , China sampled three different environmental settings and detected aerosol size range particles . 7 Additionally , a recent laboratory study demon - strated the ability of SARS - CoV - 2 to remain viable in aerosols for up to 3 h 8 . Although limited in subject numbers , our study examined this issue at the individual patient - level , thus enabling correlation of particle size distribution in the air with symptoms duration and nasopharyngeal viral loads . The absence of aerosol - generating procedures or intranasal oxygen supplementation reduces the possibility of our current ﬁ ndings being iatrogenic in nature . Larger individual patient - level studies examining the droplet and aerosolizing potential of SARS - CoV - 2 over different distances and under different patient and environmental conditions are rapidly needed to determine the generalizability of our current ﬁ ndings . Contrary to the study from Wuhan , China that detected SARS - CoV - 2 in aerosols 0 . 25 – 1 . 0 µm in diameter 7 , the smallest aero - dynamic size fraction that contained detectable levels of SARS - CoV - 2 in our study was 1 – 4 µm . The non - detection of SARS - CoV - 2 in particles < 1 µm could have been due to the reduced ef ﬁ ciency of extracting viruses from ﬁ lters as compared with extracting viruses adhered to the wall of the 1 . 5 mL and 15 mL centrifuge tubes , where particles 1 – 4 µm and > 4 µm in diameter are captured using the NIOSH aerosol sampler . Fur - thermore , to our knowledge , this is the ﬁ rst time the NIOSH samplers have been used to capture coronaviruses . Therefore , no baseline data exist for airborne coronavirus sampling using these samplers , limiting our understanding of the negative results in the < 1 µm size fraction . The extent of environmental contamination we found in our study could be attributable to direct touch contamination by either the patient or healthcare workers after contact with infected respiratory ﬂ uids . However , contamination through respiratory droplets emitted through coughing and sneezing , as well as through respiratory aerosols , is also plausible . Con - tamination of surface sites not frequently touched ( air exhaust vents and ﬂ oor ) support this latter hypothesis . In the current analysis , the presence and concentration of SARS - CoV - 2 in air and high - touch surface samples correlated with the day of illness and nasopharyngeal viral loads of COVID - 19 patients . This ﬁ nding is supported by multiple observational clinical studies , which have demonstrated that SARS - CoV - 2 viral loads peak in the ﬁ rst week among COVID - 19 patients 2 , 9 , 10 , with active viral replication in the upper respiratory tract in the ﬁ rst 5 days of illness 11 . This ﬁ nding could help inform public health and infection prevention measures in prioritizing resources by risk stratifying COVID - 19 patients by their potential to directly or indirectly transmit the SARS - CoV - 2 virus to others . Our study was limited in that it did not determine the ability of SARS - CoV - 2 to be cultured from the environmental swabs and the differentially sized air particles , which would be vital to determining the infectiousness of the detected particles . Another study from Nebraska attempted virus culture on SARS - CoV - 2 PCR - positive air samples , however could not isolate viable virus 12 . The dif ﬁ culty in culturing virus from air samples arises from low - virus concentrations , as well as the compromised integrity of the virus due to air sampling stressors . Future studies using enhanced virus culture techniques could be considered 13 , and efforts to design a culture method to isolate virus from our Location P e r c en t age s a m p l ed c on t a m i na t ed 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 F l oo r B ed r a il Lo ck e r hand l e C a r d i a c t ab l e E l e c t r i c s w i t c h C ha i r T o il e t s ea t and f l u s h A i r e x hau s t v en t ( n = 5 ) Fig . 1 Percentage of contaminated swabs from surface samples , in rooms with any contamination .

Second , sampling in an AIIR environment may not be representative of community settings and further work is needed to generalize our current ﬁ ndings . Third , we sampled each room at a single timepoint during the course of illness and did not track environmental contamination over the course of illness for individual patients . Fourth , as clinical results were within 72 h of environmental testing , it is plausible that during the day of testing , viral load was actually low or negligible , hence limiting environmental contamination . Current evidence does not seem to point to aerosolization as the key route of transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 , and there have been reports of healthcare workers not being infected after exposure to con ﬁ rmed patients despite not using airborne pre - cautions 14 . Detailed epidemiologic studies of outbreaks , in both healthcare and non - healthcare settings , should be carried out to determine the relative contribution of various routes of trans - mission and their correlation with patient - level factors . In conclusion , in a limited number of AIIR environments , our current study involving individual COVID - 19 patients not undergoing aerosol - generating procedures suggests that SARS - CoV - 2 can be shed in the air from a patient in particles sized between 1 and 4 microns . Even though particles in this size range have the potential to linger longer in the air , more data on viability and infectiousness of the virus would be required to con ﬁ rm the potential airborne spread of SARS - CoV - 2 . Addi - tionally , the concentrations of SARS - CoV - 2 in the air and high - touch surfaces could be highest during the ﬁ rst week of COVID - 19 illness . Further work is urgently needed to examine these ﬁ ndings in larger numbers and different settings to better understand the factors affecting air and surface spread of SARS - CoV - 2 and inform effective infection prevention policies . Methods Study design , patient selection , and data collection . We conducted this cross - sectional study in AIIRs at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases , Singapore . These rooms had 12 air changes per hour , an average temperature of 23°C , relative humidity of 53 – 59 % , and exhaust ﬂ ow of 579 . 6 m 3 / h . Patients with a SARS - CoV - 2 infection con ﬁ rmed by a polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) - positive respiratory sample within the prior 72h were included . Clinical characteristics , including the presence of symptoms , day of illness , day of stay in the room , supplemental oxygen requirement , and baseline characteristics , were collected . One patient from a previously published pilot study on environmental sampling in the same facility ( Patient 30 ; Supplementary Table 1 ) was also included in the current analysis 1 . Air sampling . Six NIOSH BC 251 bioaerosol samplers were placed in each of three AIIRs in the general ward to collect air samples ( set - up depicted in Supplementary Fig . 1 ) .

Particles > 4 μ m in diameter are collected in a 15 mL centrifuge tube , particles 1 – 4 μ m in diameter are collected in a 1 . 5mL centrifuge tube , and parti - cles < 1 μ m in diameter are collected in a self - assembled ﬁ lter cassette containing a 37 - mm diameter , PTFE ﬁ lter with 3 μ m pores . All NIOSH samplers were con - nected to either SKC AirCheck TOUCH Pumps or SKC Universal air sampling pumps set at a ﬂ ow - rate of 3 . 5 L / min and run for 4h , collecting a total of 5040 L of air from each patient ’ s room . In the room of Patient 1 , three NIOSH samplers were attached to each of two tripod stands and situated at different heights from the ground ( 1 . 2 m , 0 . 9m , and 0 . 7m ) near the air exhaust to capture particles from the unidirectional air ﬂ ow in the room . Throughout the 4 - hour sampling period , Patient 1 was intermittently facing the NIOSH samplers , whereas seated 1 meter from the ﬁ rst tripod and 2 . 1 meters from the second tripod . Four SKC 37mm PTFE ﬁ lter ( 0 . 3 μ m pore size ) cassettes were also distributed throughout the room and connected to SKC Universal air sampling pumps set at a ﬂ ow - rate of 5L / min , each collecting an additional 1200 L of air from the room . In the rooms of Patients 2 and 3 , three NIOSH samplers were attached to each of two tripod stands and situated at different heights from the ground ( 1 . 2 m , 0 . 9m , and 0 . 7m ) . Throughout the 4 - hour sampling period , Patients 2 and 3 remained in bed within 1 meter from all six NIOSH samplers ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Patient 3 was also talking on the phone for a signi ﬁ cant proportion of time during sampling . Additional SKC pumps with PTFE ﬁ lter cassettes were not used in the rooms of Patient 2 and 3 . The six NIOSH samples from each room were pooled prior to analysis , but the particle size fractions remained separated . Each sample pool was representative of 5040 L air . Surface sampling . Surface samples were collected with Puritan EnviroMax Plus pre - moistened macrofoam sterile swabs ( 25 - 88060 ) . Eight to 20 surface samples were collected from each room . Five surfaces were designated high - touch surfaces , including the cardiac table , entire length of the bed rails including bed control panel and call bell , bedside locker , electrical switches on top of the beds , and chair in general ward rooms ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . In ICU rooms , the ventilator and infusion pumps were sampled instead of the electrical switches on top of the beds and chair ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Air exhaust outlets and glass window surfaces were sampled in ﬁ ve rooms , including the three rooms in which air sampling was performed . Toilet seat and automatic ﬂ ush button ( one combined swab ) were sampled in AIIR rooms in the general ward . Supplementary Table 2 lists all surface samples . Sample transfer and processing . All samples were immediately stored at 4°C in the hospital prior to transfer to a BSL - 3 laboratory where samples were immedi - ately processed and stored at − 80°C unless directly analyzed . Prior to RNA extraction , NIOSH aerosol sample tubes and ﬁ lters were processed as previously described 15 , with slight modi ﬁ cation due to the pooling of samples . Laboratory methods . The QIAamp viral RNA mini kit ( Qiagen Hilden , Germany ) was used for sample RNA extraction . Real - time PCR assays targeting the envelope ( E ) genes 16 and an orf1ab assay modi ﬁ ed from Drosten et al . 17 were used to detect SARS - CoV - 2 in the samples 18 . In brief , for the envelope gene assay , a 20µl reaction mix was prepared with 12 . 5 µl of SuperScript III Platinum One - Step qRT - PCR Kit ( Thermo ﬁ sher Scienti ﬁ c , USA ) buffer , 0 . 75 mM Mg 2 SO 4 , 5 µl of RNA , 400 nM each of the forward primer ( E _ Sarbeco _ F1 - ACAGGTACGTTAATAGTTAATAG CGT ) and reverse primer ( E _ Sarbeco _ R2 - ATATTGCAGCAGTACGCACACA ) with 200nM of probe ( E _ Sarbeco _ P1 - ( FAM ) ACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGCGC TTCG ( BHQ1 ) ) . Thermal cycling conditions included reverse transcription at 55°C for 10 min , an initial denaturation at 95°C for 5min , followed by 45 cyles of 95°C for 15 s , 58°C for 1 min . For the orf1ab assay , a 20µl reaction mix was prepared with 12 . 5 µl of SuperScript III Platinum One - Step qRT - PCR Kit ( Ther - mo ﬁ sher Scienti ﬁ c , USA ) buffer , 0 . 5 mM Mg 2 SO 4 , 5µl of RNA , 800nM each of the forward primer ( Wu - BNI - F - CTAACATGTTTATCACCCGCG ) and reverse primer ( Wu - BNI - R - CTCTAGTAGCATGACACCCCTC ) with 400 nM of probe ( WU - BNI - P - ( FAM ) TAAGACATGTACGTGCATGGATTGGCTT ( BHQ1 ) ) . Thermal cycling conditions included reverse transcription at 55 °C for 10min , an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5min , followed by 45 cyles of 95°C for 15s , 60 °C for 1 min . All samples were run in duplicate and with both assays . Positive detection was recorded as long as ampli ﬁ cation was observed in at least one assay . Cleaning regimen of rooms . Routine environmental cleaning of the rooms was carried out by a trained team of housekeeping staff . High - touch surfaces ( e . g . , bed rail , cardiac table , switches ) were cleaned twice daily using 5000 parts per million ( ppm ) sodium dichloroisocyanurate ( NaDCC ) , reconstituted using Biospot Effer - vescent Chlorine Tablets . The ﬂ oor was cleaned daily using 1000 ppm NaDCC . All surface sampling was performed in the morning before the ﬁ rst cleaning cycle for the day . Statistical analysis . Statistical analysis was performed using Stata version 15 . 1 ( StataCorp , College Station , Texas ) and GraphPad Prism 8 . 0 ( GraphPad Software , Inc . , San Diego ) . P < 0 . 05 was considered statistically signi ﬁ cant , and all tests were two - tailed . For the surface environment , outcome measures analyzed were any positivity by room and pooled percentage positivity by day of illness and respiratory viral load ( represented by clinical cycle threshold ( Ct ) value ) . We analyzed the factors associated with environmental contamination using the Stu - dent t test , or the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank - sum test was used for continuous variables depending on their distribution . The χ 2 or Fisher exact test was used to compare categorical variables . We plotted the best ﬁ t curve by least - square method to study the environmental contamination distribution across various the days of illness and clinical Ct value . Ethics statement .
