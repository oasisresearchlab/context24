Here , we resolve intact α IIb β 3 structure at 3Å resolution , 21 revealing the overall topology of the heterodimer with the transmembrane ( TM ) helices and the 22 head region ligand - binding domain tucked in a specific angle proximity to the TM region . In 23 response to the addition of a Mn 2 + agonist , we resolved two coexisting states , “intermediate” and 24 “pre - active” . Our structures show conformational changes of the intact α IIb β 3 activating trajectory , 25 as well as a unique twisting of the lower integrin legs representing an intermediate state ( TM 26 region at a twisting conformation ) and a coexisting pre - active state ( bent and opening in leg ) , 27 which is required for inducing the transitioning platelets to accumulate . Our structure provides for 28 the first time direct structural evidence for the lower legs’ involvement in full - length integrin 29 activation mechanisms . Additionally , our structure offers a new strategy to target the α IIb β 3 lower 30 leg allosterically instead of modulating the affinity of the α IIb β 3 head region . 31 Introduction 32 Platelets are fundamental to preventing hemorrhaging at sites of vascular injuries through 33 thrombosis , a healthy response to injury intended to stop and prevent further bleeding . However , 34 their functions are tightly controlled since abnormal thrombosis can cause life - threatening health 35 problems , when a clot obstructs blood flow through healthy blood vessels in the circulatory 36 system . 1 Integrins are a major family of cell surface receptors which platelets use to surveil their 37 environment and are essential to platelet activation . 2 – 6 Integrins are multifunctional , they mediate 38 the adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix and to other cells , plus they participate via 39 intracellular and extracellular signaling in diverse cellular processes including cell growth , 40 migration , and differentiation . 5 – 8 They are obligate heterodimers composed of a pair of α and β 41 subunits . 42 α IIb β 3 is the major integrin expressed on platelets . 5 , 6 Both the α IIb and β 3 protomers are single - 43 pass transmembrane proteins , 8 ( also known as a bitopic protein ) each with a short cytoplasmic 44 tail and a large extracellular domain responsible for heterodimer and ligand interactions . Integrin 45 α IIb β 3 plays an integral role in thrombosis . 9 , 10 Functionally , integrin α IIb β 3 transmits bidirectional 46 signals across the cell membrane , in both “outside - in” and “inside - out” directions . 11 47 Mechanistically , either extracellular or intracellular signals lead to eventual conformational 48 changes in α IIb β 3 to an activated state , which serves as one of the final steps in platelet activation 49 and thus plays a pivotal role in thrombosis . 12 α IIb β 3 direct involvement in the regulation of 50 thrombosis makes it an appealing target for therapeutic strategy development . 51 Prior structural studies on integrin α IIb β 3 and its homologs have focused on individual domains 52 namely the ectodomain and the headpiece . 13 – 16 Due to the flexibility of the linkers between 53 domains , the detailed full - length structure has remained elusive , restricting our understanding on 54 the precise arrangement of each domain with respect to one another . The orientations between 55 the ectodomain and the TM helices are exceptionally fundamental to fully understanding the 56 integrin conformational changes on the surface . Such knowledge will provide crucial insights into 57 the mechanism of ligand binding modulation and of coupling between extra - and intra - cellular 58 domains , which allows the signal to be transduced across the membrane . Previous studies on 59 the structural determination of integrin α IIb β 3 either were restricted to the head region or only 60 yielded low resolution structures by electron microscopy of negatively stained protein . 16 – 21 61 Whereas the current understanding of integrin activation process implies a massive intermediate 62 conformational change from inactive to active states , it requires a structural understanding of 63 these intermediate states in detail . 22 Relative organization between regions , which in turn is 64 regulated by individual domain conformations , defines the state of an α IIb β 3 integrin and provides 65 a structural basis for the mobility of the whole molecule . 66 Integrin α IIb β 3 undergoes extensive glycosylation , which shows its necessity for dimer formation 67 and its physiological functions . 23 However , most structural studies have used recombinant 68 systems to obtain integrin proteins , and not all glycosylation sites and types of glycans at each 69 site can be retained using such systems . In this study , we report the first structure of full - length 70 integrin α IIb β 3 from native sources , with native glycosylation . The series of structures reported 71 here provide new insights into the mechanism of integrin activation and its role in thrombosis , 72 providing new opportunities for structural targets for future therapeutics against platelet - linked 73 cardiovascular diseases . 74 Result 75 Overall structure of native integrin α IIb β 3 in its inactive state 76 We solved three distinct structures of α IIb β 3 induced by different combinations of divalent cations : 77 state I ( 5 mM Mg 2 + / 1 mM Ca 2 + ) ; state II ( 1 mM Mn 2 + / 0 . 2 mM Ca 2 + ) ; and state III ( 1mM Mn 2 + / 0 . 2 78 mM Ca 2 + ) , with states II and III co - existing , but separable structurally from cryo - EM data . Full - 79 length integrin α IIb β 3 was purified directly from human platelets after solubilizing in detergent ( see 80 Methods ) . Using single particle cryoEM , we solved the full - length native structure of integrin 81 α IIb β 3 at 3 Å resolution including both full ectodomain and transmembrane region in state I . All 82 domains could be clearly assigned and grouped into three large regions , which are head , leg , and 83 TM regions , according to their local positions . The detailed architecture variations in intact integrin 84 at different conformational states among all three regions is still unclear . 85 In the absence of agonist , purified integrin α IIb β 3 exhibited a bent form , indicating the inactive 86 state ( state I ) based on the overall features . 8 This conclusion is supported by the ligand binding 87 domain located at the interface between the β - propeller domain from α IIb and β I domain from β 3 88 shown in Fig . 1 ( see details in Methods ) . The head and leg region form a sharp angle ( ~ 70° ) 89 between each other , defining the orientation of the whole extracellular domain and characterizing 90 the bent form of integrin α IIb β 3 . The head and leg region form the whole ectodomain that is 91 anchored to the membrane by the TM region . Although the ectodomain has been investigated 92 previously , it is remarkable that in this structure , the TM region topology in the full - length protein 93 is determined for the first time . The architectural relationship between the TM and leg regions is 94 clarified , along with the orientation of integrin α IIb β 3 towards the membrane . In our structure , the 95 Calf - 2 domain from α IIb and tail domain from β 3 position the single transmembrane helix 96 anchoring through the detergent shell that mimics the cell membrane , and form a ~ 60° degree 97 angle with it . In contrast to previous schematic models proposed in their papers , 24 , 25 which 98 depicted a vertically standing integrin with its head region facing the membrane , our structure 99 showed α IIb β 3 adopted a tilted orientation that consequently would make the head region and 100 the ligand binding site more accessible . 101 The head region is critical for α IIb β 3 integrin activation , as the head region contains both the ion - 102 binding and ligand - binding sites . The β - propeller from α IIb and the β I domain from β 3 together 103 form the main part of the integrin head region . The ion binding pockets including SyMBS 104 ( synergistic metal ion - binding site ) , MIDAS ( metal ion - dependent adhesion site ) , and ADMIDAS 105 ( adjacent to MIDAS ) residing in the head region are well - resolved in our structure and the 106 coordinated ions could also be identified ( Fig . 1 , Supplemental Fig . 1 ) . All three ions were resolved 107 clearly in our structure , and there is no conformational difference compared to previous crystal 108 structures of only the head region fragment focusing on the extracellular domain , 15 which indicates 109 the stability of this binding site is not likely to be impaired due to loss of the TM region . Key 110 residues participating in ion coordination include Asp126 for ADMIDAS ; Ser123 for MIDAS ; and 111 Asp217 , Pro219 , and Glu220 for SyMBS , all of which are mostly conserved among the RGD - 112 binding integrins . We also observed in the distal location of the ligand - binding site for the β - 113 propeller , four Ca 2 + ions coordinated with adjacent residues to further stabilize the β - sheets ( Fig . 114 1 ) . 115 In the present study , the TM region was first resolved together with the connected leg regions . 116 Although the TM region only accounts for less than 10 % of integrin residues , it is a critical 117 component of the mechanism . It undergoes movements to transduce the outside - in or inside - out 118 signals . 26 However , the relative orientation between the TM region and extracellular domain had 119 yet to be determined before this study , excluding some low resolution structures . 27 To deal with 120 the low signal - to - noise ratio ( SNR ) and TM region flexibility , we employed 3D focus classification 121 to sort out particles and resolved two helices from α IIb and β 3 and the linker between Calf - 2 and 122 α IIb helix . The two helices adopted a twisted conformation and went across each other forming a 123 knot at the membrane proximal site . The loop linker between the TM region and whole 124 extracellular domain renders the potential flexibility for the integrin to unwind and separate the 125 helices , which is the prerequisite of activation . 126 Glycosylation sites 127 Aside from the TM region , our structure resolved all glycosylation sites that were uncertain in the 128 prior ectodomain - only structure . 15 Since our integrin α IIb β 3 was directly obtained from the 129 membrane extraction of platelets , it likely reflects the physiological glycosylation situation . In this 130 structure , we identified eight N - linked glycosylation sites ( Fig . 2 ) . α IIb and β 3 each have four 131 glycosylation sites , with β 3 having more complicated glycosylation . 132 In the previous α IIb β 3 structure , three N - linked glycan sites from α IIb were resolved and identified 133 ( Asn15 , Asn249 , and Asn570 ) . 15 The protein obtained from natural extract in this study also 134 exhibited the same glycosylation pattern for these three already known glycan sites . In addition , 135 we reveal a previously proposed but never resolved glycan site Asn931 . Extra density was found 136 connected to Asn931 indicating , for the first time , that N - linked glycans are attached to this site 137 ( Supplemental Fig . 3 ) , though it was formerly predicted as a glycosylation site . 28 138 The β 3 , Asn99 , Asn320 , Asn371 , and Asn559 could be identified as N - linked glycosylation sites 139 by the presence of the density for N - glycans , which is consistent with previous structural studies . 140 However , N - linked glycosylation site Asn320 ( β 3 ) was identified to have five saccharide residues 141 compared to the two saccharide residues found in the previous study . 15 Since the glycosylation 142 tree is located at the interface between α IIb and β 3 , the protruding glycans establish interactions 143 between α IIb and β 3 . By introducing a water molecule , the mannose interacts with Gln821 from 144 the α IIb Calf - 2 domain through hydrogen bonds , which tethers the head to the leg and stabilizes 145 the bent conformation ( Fig . 2 IV ) . In addition , the dimerization of α IIb and β 3 , which is the 146 prerequisite to becoming a functional unit , is reinforced by this interaction . However , since the 147 interaction is regulated by the hydrogen bonds donated by water , the interaction is transient and 148 easily disturbed , providing the potential for conformational changes between states . The structural 149 details of interaction between α IIb and β 3 introduced by glycans are observed for the first time in 150 our structure , and they reveal the importance of glycosylation in the activation of α IIb β 3 as well 151 as other homologous integrins . 152 Transition from inactive to an intermediate state 153 The replacement of Mg 2 + with Mn 2 + mimics the inside - out signal transduction and triggers the 154 activation of α IIb β 3 , as deduced from recognition of Mn 2 + induced conformation - specific 155 antibodies . 29 We replaced Mg 2 + with Mn 2 + during the purification and determined the α IIb β 3 156 structure bound with Mn 2 + . We found two new conformations with a particle ratio of 1 : 1 , exhibiting 157 domain movement and a partially opening . The structures were determined at 3 . 12 Å ( hereafter 158 referred to as the “intermediate state” ) and 5 . 46 Å ( referred to as the “pre - active state” ) resolutions 159 respectively . Previous structural studies of an Mn 2 + bound integrin , which were limited to a 160 negative stained TEM result , showed that the integrin may exhibit both bent and open state , but 161 provided no additional high resolution details . 30 Our cryoEM study did not resolve the integrin in 162 a fully open and typically active state , which was inferred by previous studies on the isolated head 163 region . 31 164 Since this new structure cannot be assigned to any known state , we name it an “intermediate 165 state” in this research . At 3 . 12 Å resolution , substantial conformational changes between the 166 intermediate and inactive state of α IIb β 3 were found between these two structures . Readily 167 discernible conformational changes and domain movements were found , even though both still 168 adopt a bent orientation . To better elaborate the allosteric changes among all states , β - propeller 169 domains from inactive and intermediate states were superimposed and resultant relative 170 orientations of other domains between the two states were examined ( Fig . 3 ) . Big movements 171 mainly appear at the leg region including the Calf - 1 ( α - Calf - 1 ) and Calf - 2 ( α - Calf - 2 ) domains from 172 α IIb , and the EGF - 4 ( β - EGF - 4 ) and Tail ( β - Tail ) domain from β 3 indicated by the RMSD values 173 for the domains ranging from 2 . 7 to 8 . 4 Å ( Fig . 3 ) . 174 The movements appeared mainly in three regions ( I , II , and III in Fig . 3 ) , as if there were three 175 forces from different directions affecting the α IIb β 3 heterodimer . The region I showed a potential 176 turn of the head region represented by a 3 . 5 Å shift in backbone at Glu205 from the β I domain , 177 indicating the head region in the β 3 molecule underwent a lift - up to facilitate the separation from 178 the leg region . The region II has a split effect at the leg region , which is pulling apart the α - Calf - 2 179 and β - Tail domain . Both the α - Calf - 2 and β - Tail swing outwards separating the two legs , which is 180 exemplified by the distance between α - Pro778 and β - Asn654 changing from 9 . 5 Å to 11 . 5 Å . The 181 region III , mainly located at the β - EGF - 4 domain , generated a shift moving away from the β 3 head 182 region as well as α IIb leg region . In summary , when integrin α IIb β 3 was treated with Mn 2 + / Ca 2 + 183 instead of Mg 2 + / Ca 2 + , α IIb β 3 exhibited domain movement shown as a head region lift - up and leg 184 region separation and thus a potential to open . All three kinds of movements happened 185 simultaneously to potentially open the α IIb β 3 . Region I , II , and III exhibited the potential to turn 186 the head region , to separate the leg region , and to break the connection between the head and 187 leg regions , respectively . Consequently , TM helices were also separated by the aforementioned 188 movement , making the signal too weak to resolve the individual transmembrane helix in our final 189 structure of this state . 190 A pre - active form captured after the intermediate form 191 Given the conformation of the Mn 2 + bound integrin , α IIb β 3 is highly dynamic , as shown 192 previously 32 as well as by this study , we demonstrate both conformations coexist simultaneously 193 in the same ratio . In our study , in addition to the intermediate form of α IIb β 3 , another new form 194 was also found during data processing , providing a new view of the molecular mechanism 195 underlying the activation of α IIb β 3 ( Fig . 3 ) in presence of Mn 2 + . 29 Compared to the intermediate 196 state , domain movement and even rearrangement continued to occur at regions I , II , and III , 197 indicating this is a resultant or subsequent state after the intermediate state . We named this state 198 the “pre - active” state . 199 When α - Calf - 2 domains from intermediate and pre - active states are superimposed , variations at 200 region I in the head region are the most obvious movement if viewed in the front ( Fig 3 ) . As the 201 β - β I domain continues to lift up , generated from the intermediate state , it forms a conformation 202 that significantly turns in the counterclockwise direction , which makes the head region move 203 farther away from the membrane . At region II , the legs were separated wider than ( directly 204 measured Asn789 ( α - Calf - 2 ) - Asp596 ( β - EGF4 ) residues distance , changed from 14 . 7 Å to 47 . 1 205 Å between the two states ) all other states , and interactions between the α - Calf - 2 and β - Tail 206 domain could have already been disrupted at this distance . Although the density of the TM region 207 could not be seen in this state , it is reasonable that the two TM regions from α IIb and β 3 could 208 also rotate and disjoin from each other in the scenario of a leg region separation given the distance . 209 In addition , separation between the head and leg region also became more obvious in region III . 210 The leg region , including β - EGF - 2 , 3 , and 4 , swung away from and thus formed a bigger angle 211 with the head region . The loss of interaction between the head and leg domains , caused by the 212 large movement , unleashed the restrictions that existed in the inactive state and provided 213 flexibility for the integrin to be regulated . In summary , the pre - active state exhibited a subsequent 214 conformation of the intermediate state reflected by the continuous movement occurring at regions 215 I , II , and III . The resultant effect made the integrin α IIb β 3 undergo both intra - molecule separation 216 ( head and leg domain in β 3 ) and inter - molecule separation ( leg regions from α IIb and β 3 ) . 217 Discussion 218 In this study , we resolved the structures of three integrin α IIb β 3 states in the presence of Mg 2 + or 219 Mn 2 + , revealing the conformational changes between different states , which shed light on the 220 underlying mechanism of activation . We extracted the integrin α IIb β 3 directly from platelets to 221 keep the structure close to the physiological state , especially for the glycosylation . 33 – 35 222 Structures for both the extracellular domain 16 and isolated TM region 34 have been reported 223 previously . However , the spatial relationship between the two parts has not been described . In 224 our structure , we demonstrated that the TM region forms a 60° angle with the leg region , which 225 means the leg region is not perfectly vertical against the membrane as previously proposed . 21 , 36 – 226 38 The coiled loop linking the extracellular domain and TM region renders the flexibility of the 227 integrin so that the extracellular and intracellular domain could have an independent 228 conformational change , which provides the structural basis for bidirectional signaling . On the other 229 hand , the orientation adopted by the integrin also lifts the head region up , which shows the 230 distance between the head region and cell surface would be larger . In our model , the distance 231 from membrane to the head region is around 5 . 25 nm compared to 2 . 41 nm showed in previous 232 suggested models . 35 , 39 ( Supplemental Fig . 4 ) Since the head region , where the RGD - motif resides , 233 is important in terms of ligand - binding , the longer distance to the platelet membrane would make 234 the head region more accessible for the large population of integrin ligand proteins which contain 235 the “RGD” and “KQADV” motif but do not share similar overall protein architecture . It is also 236 noteworthy that the resolvability of the TM region of integrin α IIb β 3 could shed light on other 237 bitopic proteins . 238 As a cell membrane glycoprotein , integrin α IIb β 3 carries several N - glycans on the extracellular 239 domain . However , it remains unclear how the glycosylation works , it is tempting to speculate the 240 N - glycans would be involved in the structural changes and thus the activation of integrins . 28 241 Without predictions or partially resolved , 15 , 28 , 31 , 40 , 41 our structure resolves eight glycosylation sites 242 in the intact integrin . Among these sites , Asn931 is located at the leg region and closer to the cell 243 membrane compared with the other glycosylation sites within α IIb , it is likely that our structure 244 study revealed initial conformational changes by leg region movement which may play an 245 important role during the activation process . A previous mutagenesis study on the glycosylation 246 sites in α IIb has also demonstrated that , among all Asn substitutions in the α IIb subunit , only a 247 N931Q mutation exhibited a decrease in both activation response and protein expression of β 3 . 28 248 For the glycosylation at Asn320 from β 3 , previously resolved structures either identified only two 249 glycans in an ectodomain structure or five glycans in a head region only structure . Thus , it is hard 250 to clearly demonstrate how the glycosylation of Asn320 participates in the activation of the integrin . 251 In contrast , in our full - length structure , there are five glycan residues that could be seen attached 252 to Asn320 . Asn320 was previously proposed to block the leg - proximal end of the ligand binding 253 site in the α IIb β 3 integrin . 28 This study reveals a longer glycosylation tree , and it shows the core 254 glycosylation tree pointing at the Calf - 2 domain ( Fig . 2 ) . It is highly conceivable that Asn320 would 255 be more likely to play a supplemental role to connect α IIb and β 3 via the glycans instead of 256 regulating the ligand bind . In this structure , a water molecule was found to help establish the 257 interaction between α IIb and β 3 and stabilize the structure , however , it is possible that in the 258 context of blood circulation molecules other than water would be more favorable for this interface . 259 The purification of native α IIb β 3 from human platelet preserves more glycosylation sites 260 compared to the structures determined from other expression systems . The structural 261 characterization of glycosylation sites in this study offers fundamental building blocks for 262 rigid / homogenous regions of glycans composition and linkage in three - dimensions . 19 Due to the 263 limitation of naturally purified membrane protein ， a mutagenesis study of the glycosylation sites 264 is not applicable to this study . However , these glycosylation sites have already been extensively 265 studied . Due to the flexibility of glycans , the full glycan chain of each site in the α IIb β 3 remains to 266 be determined . 267 In our study , we solved two co - existing structures in the presence of Mn 2 + , which was proposed 268 to activate the integrin . 29 , 42 , 43 The Mn 2 + ion is not resolvable due to the resolution limitation , which 269 is common with all structures previously solved in the α IIb β 3 active state . 3 , 17 , 31 , 40 Instead of an 270 open form of integrin , both forms found in our study adopt the conformation between an inactive 271 and fully active state , which was named the “intermediate” and “pre - active” state . Through 272 comparison of all three structures solved in our study , we hypothesized they could represent a 273 series of states before the active state ( Fig . 4 ) . 274 Upon activation , previous structure of β 3 - only fragments ( contains the headpiece and β - knee 275 regions but lacks the α unit ) reported an extended conformation at the I - EGF1 / 2 junction making 276 the leg almost form a right angle with the head region . 19 The increased angle between the head 277 and leg regions also exists in our pre - active structure , however , the angle is not as large as it was 278 found in the isolated extended β 3 . Assuming the leg and head region move away from each other 279 from an acute angle to a straight orientation during activation , it is possible the confirmation found 280 in our study is an initial activation state prior to the proposed activated state . Though the I - EGF1 / 2 281 was found to exhibit flexibility to render the conformational change , the rigidity of hybrid / PSI , I - 282 EGF2 / 3 , and I - EGF3 / 4 is still maintained during activation . This is also consistent with our pre - 283 active model , revealing that the interface between I - EGF1 / 2 is the only changing part during 284 activation ( Fig . 3 ) . Specifically , according to another research using anti – HPA - 1a alloantibodies 285 to identify the integrin activation , the PSI / I - EGF1 domains were proposed to move away from the 286 I - EGF2 domain during activation . 19 In this study , by superimposing the head domain of our 287 intermediate and pre - active models , we found I - EGF2 moved closer to the PSI domain , which 288 provides structural evidence to the relative movement between the head and leg regions . 289 Considering treatment with Mn 2 + could mimic the inside - out signaling pathway , 17 , 43 – 46 the bent 290 form with separated leg region obtained in our study is in line with the previous hypothetical 291 model , 40 but provides a substantial and detailed structural basis . Since the actual signal receptor 292 would be the cytoplasmic tails in the inside - out pathway , our structure explains how the leg region 293 moves before and thus induces the head region movement . Therefore , a possible therapeutic 294 design would be more potent if it inhibited the leg movement in the beginning of activation . Since 295 the leg region and head region would be separated as rigid domains , the connection between 296 them , the knee , is presumably a good target site . To be more specific , the interfaces between the 297 α IIb thigh and calf - 1 domains and β 3 EGF1 and EGF2 domains would exhibit different amino acid 298 profiles and expose different epitopes during the whole activation process , where the inhibitory 299 antibody can intervene and “lock” the integrin in different states accordingly . 300 Methods 301 Protein extraction and purification 302 The integrin α IIb β 3 was initially extracted from human platelets obtained from the Gulf Coast 303 Regional Blood Center ( Houston , TX , USA ) . We purified WT full length integrin α IIb β 3 from human 304 platelets by adapting a protocol described previously . 32 Cells were spun down at 1 , 200 rpm for 5 305 min and then resuspended in the CGS buffer for several rounds until red blood cells were fully 306 removed . The final supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 2 , 500 rpm for 30 min , and the 307 resultant platelet pellet was resuspended using a TBS buffer . After several rounds of 308 homogenization using a Dounce B set , the platelet lysis was spun down at 2000 rpm for 10 min 309 to remove the cell debris followed by another centrifuge at 30 , 000 rpm for 1 hour to collect the 310 cell membrane fraction . The cell membrane fraction was solubilized at 4°C overnight in the 2 % 311 ( w / v ) Triton X - 100 supplemented TBS buffer containing 10 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 312 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM CaCl 2 . The solubilized membrane protein was collected from the 313 supernatant after centrifugation at 30 , 000 rpm for 1 hour . The supernatant was then applied to 314 concanavalin - A , an affinity column ( Con A Sepharose 4B ) , and eluted with a buffer containing 315 methyl - α - D - mannopyranoside and 0 . 01 % - 0 . 02 % ( w / v ) Triton X - 100 . Ion exchange 316 chromatography ( MonoQ ) and size - exclusion chromatography ( Superose 6 ) were completed 317 using a buffer containing 20 mM Hepes , 150 mM NaCl , DDM ( 2x - 4x CMC ) , 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 318 mM CaCl 2 . Peak fraction was collected for the cryoEM specimen preparation ( Supplemental Fig . 319 1 ) . For integrin α IIb β 3 in the Mn 2 + condition , the buffer was supplemented with 1 mM MnCl 2 and 320 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 instead of Mg 2 + / Ca 2 + , while using the same purification protocols . 321 CryoEM sample preparation and data collection 322 For cryo - EM sample preparation , a 3 μ l aliquot of purified integrin α IIb β 3 was applied onto a 200 - 323 mesh R3 . 5 / 1 Quantifoil 2nm - Cfilm grid . After applying the sample , the grid was blotted for 3 s and 324 rapidly frozen in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot IV ( FEI ) , with constant temperature and humidity 325 during the process of blotting . The grid was stored in liquid nitrogen before imaging . 326 Movie stacks were collected at 300 kV on a Krios electron microscope ( FEI ) with an in - column 327 energy filter ( 30 eV width ) equipped with a direct electron detector K2 Summit camera ( Gatan ) . 328 Images were collected semi automatically by EPU ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) in the dose 329 fractionation super - resolution counting mode at a calibrated physical pixel size of 1 . 07 Å . The 330 images were collected with a defocus range from − 1 . 0 to − 2 . 6 μ m . The total exposure time for the 331 dataset was 7 s , leading to a total accumulated dose of 50 electrons Å 2 on the specimen . Each 332 image stack was fractionated into 35 subframes , each with an accumulation time of 0 . 2 s per 333 frame . The final frame average was computed from averages of every three consecutive frames 334 to correct beam - induced motion during exposure by MotionCor2 . 47 The image in each frame was 335 weighted according to radiation damage . CTF ( Contrast Transfer Function ) parameters of the 336 particles in each frame average were determined by the program Patch CTF in cryoSPARC . 48 337 In total , 2 , 758 , 651 particle images were automatically boxed out by autopicking in cryoSPARC 338 with a box size of 256 × 256 pixels using an averaged sum of 35 raw frames per specimen area . 339 Two - dimensional ( 2D ) reference - free class averages were computed using cryoSPARC . Initial 340 models for every reconstruction were generated from scratch using selected good quality 2D 341 averages with C1 symmetry based on the 2D averaged results . This initial model was low - pass – 342 filtered to 60 Å , and refinements were carried out using cryoSPARC . After several rounds of 343 homogeneous refinement and local refinement , the resolution achieved 3 Å but with a weak signal 344 in the TM region . To improve the quality of the TM region , aligned particles were transferred to 345 RELION 49 for further processing . To deal with the low signal - to - noise ratio ( SNR ) and flexibility of 346 the TM region , we employed 3D focus classification to further sort out particles . A spherical mask 347 was created focusing on the TM region and applied to the 3D classification in RELION . The mask 348 was based on TM features and used the detergent shell - reweighted method 50 to improve TM 349 region SNR . After several rounds of iterative refinement , two helices from α IIb and β 3 and the 350 linker between Calf - 2 and α IIb helix were resolved , while the connection between β 3 tail domain 351 and helix was still elusive due to weak density in the map region . One out of four classes , which 352 appeared as a clear and separated rod - like density , was further processed using the detergent 353 shell denoise and re - weighted method 50 to improve the SNR ( Supplemental Fig . 5 ) . The final map 354 was constructed by the combination of the extracellular domain and TM region . Since within this 355 region , the EM density map is not confidently resolvable for every amino acid due to the flexibility 356 of the leg and TM region , we carried out rigid fitting of structures for the Calf - 2 domain from α IIb , 357 the Tail domain from β 3 , and the TM region . We used previously published TM region structures 358 determined by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ( NMR ) ( PDB ID : 3FCS for Calf - 2 and Tail , 2KNC for 359 TM region ) to build these parts of the model , instead of utilizing real - space refinement . The two 360 helices adopted a twisted conformation and went across each other forming a knot at the 361 membrane proximal site . The loop linker between the TM region and whole extracellular domain 362 renders the potential flexibility for the integrin to unwind and separate the helices , which is the 363 prerequisite of activation . 364 For the map in the Mn 2 + condition , the cryoSPARC processing workflow is similar to that for native 365 structure ( Supplemental Fig . 6 ) . In total , 1 , 701 , 301 particles were obtained after iterative 2D 366 classification , and ~ 10 % of particles were used for the initial model reconstruction . Each 367 conformation was obtained from subclasses in the same Mn 2 + dataset , and corresponding 368 particles were separated for further processing . Two maps showing significant differences were 369 obtained with the particle ratio 1 : 1 . 02 . For state III , the EM map was refined to a proper resolution 370 where domain information could be seen , while details for the secondary structure were still 371 missing ( Fig . 3 ) . Individual domain from integrin α IIb β 3 was rigid - docking in the density . After 372 individual refinement for each particle set , the two maps were finally refined to 3 . 09 Å and 5 . 46 Å 373 respectfully . 374 Cryo - EM model building and refinement 375 We started de novo model building for full - length inactive integrin α IIb β 3 by docking the 376 extracellular domain ( PDBID : 3FCS ) 15 and TM region ( PDBID : 2KNC ) . 51 The model was refined 377 against the corresponding map using PHENIX 52 in real space with the secondary structure and 378 geometry restraints . Since the EM density map is not confidently resolvable for every amino acid 379 at the leg and TM regions due to the flexibility , we carried out rigid fitting of structures of the Calf - 380 2 domain from α IIb , the Tail domain from β 3 , and the TM region . We used previously published 381 TM region structures determined by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ( NMR ) ( PDB ID 3FCS for Calf - 382 2 and Tail , 2KNC for TM region ) to build these parts of the model , instead of utilizing real - space 383 refinement . The model was then manually refined and adjusted in Coot . 53 The model quality was 384 validated using PHENIX and the local resolution was estimated using cryoSPARC . The 385 aforementioned workflow applied to structure refinement in the inactive form and intermediate 386 form , while the pre - active form was only applied with the rigid body - fitting for each domain due to 387 low resolution . Detailed statistics for model building and refinements are given in table ( S1 ) . The 388 final maps and models were submitted to the Electron Microscopy Data Bank ( EMDB ) ( accession 389 no ) and ( accession no ) and PDB ( accession no ) . 390 Author Contributions : Z .

Cryo - EM single - particle reconstruction and atomic model of inactive integrin α IIb β 3 . A ) 402 The structure is a heterodimer composed of α IIb and ß3 molecules . Both integrin molecules within 403 the α IIbß3 heterdimer , α IIb and ß3 , are clearly identifiable and well resolved . All five α IIb domains 404 ( ß - propeller , thigh , Calf - 1 , Calf - 2 , and TM ) and all nine ß3 domains ( ßI , Hybrid , PSI , EGF - 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 405 Tail , and TM ) are clearly assigned . B ) Regions of integrin . Based on the domain organization , the 406 whole integrin structure could also be split into three regions : Head , Leg , and TM . The integrin 407 stands on the cell membrane in a titled orientation , with a ~ 70° angle between the Head and Leg 408 regions , and ~ 60° between the Leg and TM regions . The inset figures show the densities for ion 409 binding at MIDAS , ADMIDAS , SyMBS , and ß - propeller as well as a density for the TM region .

Glycosylation of integrin α IIb β 3 . There are seven glycosylation sites resolved in this 415 structure . The global distribution of the sites is shown , which reveals that most glycosylation 416 sites are located in the Head region . The inset figures show the densities for each glycan built 417 on the structure . We resolved this structure , for the first time , to prove that Asn931 in integrin 418 α IIbß3 has N - linked glycans , though glycans at this site were not built into our final model due to 419 low resolvability . At Asn320 in the ß3 - ßI domain , mannose observed in this study interacts with 420 the α IIb - Calf - 2 domain through a hydrogen bond introduced by a water molecule . 421 422 I II III IV V VI VII I α IIb : β - propeller Asn249 Thr250 Asp245 NAG II Asn570 Leu569 NAG α IIb : thigh III β 3 : Hybrid Asn99 Phe100 Ser101 NAG NAG VII β 3 : hybrid Asn371 Phe370 NAG NAG BMA VI α IIb : β - propeller Asn320 Tyr321 Tyr318 NAG NAG BMA MAN Gln319 Asn15 Gln18 NAG IV β 3 : EGF3 NAG NAG Asn559 Cys558 Cys560 V MAN β 3 : β I α IIb : Calf - 2 β - propeller Thigh Calf - 1 Calf - 2 Hybrid EGF4 Tail β I 423 424 Figure 3 .

The 430 structure and label for the pre - active state is marked with colors , while the intermediate state is 431 gray . At regions I and II , α - Calf - 2 includes two superimposed states , which shows a turning 432 head region and simultaneous leg region separation .

The intermediate and pre - active state , both 436 of which show the inter - and intra - molecular separation potential , would exist before the active 437 state adopts a fully open form . Main movements start in the intermediate state at regions I , II , 438 and III , while continuing through the pre - active state . The bent form with separated legs 439 indicates that the leg motion precedes the head lift - up , which explains how the inside out signal 440 transmits . 441 442 α β α β α β Inactive Intermediate Pre - active I II III I II III 443 Supplemental Figure 1 .
