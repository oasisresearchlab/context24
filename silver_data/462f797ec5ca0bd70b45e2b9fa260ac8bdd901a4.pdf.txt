Received : 5 January 2012 ; in revised form : 7 February 2012 / Accepted : 15 February 2012 / Published : 27 February 2012 Abstract : Eukaryotic cells have complicated membrane systems . The outermost plasma membrane contains various substructures , such as invaginations and protrusions , which are involved in endocytosis and cell migration . Moreover , the intracellular membrane compartments , such as autophagosomes and endosomes , are essential for cellular viability . The Bin - Amphiphysin - Rvs167 ( BAR ) domain superfamily proteins are important players in membrane remodeling through their structurally determined membrane binding surfaces . A variety of BAR domain superfamily proteins exist , and each family member appears to be involved in the formation of certain subcellular structures or intracellular membrane compartments . Most of the BAR domain superfamily proteins contain SH3 domains , which bind to the membrane scission molecule , dynamin , as well as the actin regulatory WASP / WAVE proteins and several signal transduction molecules , providing possible links between the membrane and the cytoskeleton or other machineries . In this review , we summarize the current information about each BAR superfamily protein with an SH3 domain ( s ) . The involvement of BAR domain superfamily proteins in various diseases is also discussed .

Introduction The relationship between cellular morphology and diseases , such as cancer , has been unclear . However , transformed cancer cells are often first recognized by changes in their morphology . The shapes of transformed cancer cells are apparently different from those of the normal parental cells , as observed microscopically . The shape of the eukaryotic plasma membrane changes during various processes , such as cell division , cell movement , and differentiation . Eukaryotic cells also contain various intracellular vesicles that synthesize , traffic , and degrade materials , such as proteins , during membrane remodeling , including the fission and fusion of vesicles ( Figure 1 ) . Dynamic remodeling of the membrane is achieved by the interplay between proteins and lipids . Among these proteins , accumulating evidence indicates that the Bin - Amphiphysin - Rvs167 ( BAR ) domain superfamily proteins ( referred to hereafter as BAR proteins ) play key roles . Figure 1 . Subcellular structures on which Bin - Amphiphysin - Rvs167 ( BAR ) domain proteins act , as discussed in this review . The BAR proteins are evolutionarily conserved , from yeast to human [ 1 – 4 ] . The BAR domains typically form a dimer , which is the unit for membrane binding . The structures of the BAR domain dimers resemble a banana . Each dimer possesses a distinct curved surface , from almost flat like Pinkbar to those of various steepness , where the basic - charged amino acid residues form a cluster , and deforms the membrane through the binding of the curved surface to the negatively - charged phospholipids in the plasma membrane ( Figure 2 ) . BAR proteins include subfamilies defined by their BAR , N - BAR / BAR ( the Bin - Amphiphysin - Rvs167 ) , F - BAR ( extended Fes - CIP4 homology ( EFC ) / FCH - BAR ) , or I - BAR ( IRSp53 - MIM homology domain Membranes 2012 , 2 93 I - BAR / inverse - BAR ) domains [ 1 – 4 ] . SH3 domains are commonly observed among the BAR domain superfamily proteins . Most of the SH3 domains bind to WASP family proteins and dynamin . The WASP family proteins include N - WASP and WAVE , which are activators of the Arp2 / 3 complex . The Arp2 / 3 complex mediates actin polymerization , which is involved in lamellipodia formation , podosome formation , clathrin - mediated endocytosis , pathogen infection and neurite extension downstream of N - WASP and WAVE [ 5 ] . Dynamin catalyzes membrane scission [ 6 , 7 ] . The SH3 domain also binds to several other molecules , such as the lipid phosphatase synaptojanin [ 8 ] . Synaptojanin has been linked to uncoating of clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) [ 8 ] . Therefore , the BAR domain superfamily proteins that are coupled to dynamin , WASP / WAVE family proteins , and other proteins are involved in several biological functions , including regulation of both the cytoskeleton and membrane shape . In this review , we describe the current information about each BAR protein with an SH3 domain ( s ) . We also describe some BAR proteins that lack the SH3 domain , which regulate the actin cytoskeleton . Figure 2 .

The BAR and N - BAR Domain Subfamily The BAR subfamily contains the members that do not belong to the F - BAR and I - BAR subfamilies . The N - BAR domain is included in the BAR subfamily that contains amino acids that form an amphipathic helix upon membrane binding in front of the BAR domain fold . This helix is thought to enhance membrane - binding ability by its insertion into the membrane [ 9 , 10 ] . The domain organization of the BAR protein subfamily is shown in Figure 3 . Figure 3 . Domain organization of BAR subfamily proteins . BAR : Bin - Amphiphysin - Rvs domain ; SH3 : Src homology 3 domain ; RhoGAP : Rho GTPase activating protein domain ; PX : Phox homology domain ; PH : Pleckstrin Homology domain ; ArfGAP : Arf Rho GTPase activating protein domain ; PTB : Phospho - tyrosine binding domain ; PDZ : Psd - 95 , Dlg and ZO1 domain ; RhoGEF : Rho guanine - nucleotide exchange factors domain ; Ank : Ankyrin . 2 . 1 . Amphiphysin The structure of the BAR domain was first solved for Arfaptin , but was first characterized as a membrane - binding domain for amphiphysin [ 9 , 11 ] . The positively - charged surface of the amphiphysin BAR domain binds to the negatively - charged plasma membrane , mostly through phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate [ PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] [ 9 ] . Furthermore , the BAR domains from Membranes 2012 , 2 95 amphiphysin have membrane - induced amphipathic helix on the dimer ends , and thus it is classified as an N - BAR domain . The hydrophobic amino acids are inserted into the membrane , like a wedge , thereby strengthening the interaction between the membrane and the BAR domain [ 9 ] . The SH3 domain of amphiphysin binds both dynamin and N - WASP , and these interactions are thought to be important for its function [ 12 , 13 ] . Amphiphysin has a binding site for clathrin between the BAR domain and the SH3 domain . Dynamin binding to the SH3 domain of amphiphysin was shown to disrupt clathrin binding to the N - terminal region [ 14 ] . Recruitment kinetics of amphiphysin and other BAR proteins to CCPs was recently shown by Taylor et al . [ 15 ] . The narrow tubular invaginations in the membrane , generated by the BAR domain of amphiphysin , suggested that amphiphysin acts at a late stage of fission for clathrin - mediated endocytosis . In addition to endocytosis , the N - BAR domain of amphiphysin is required for ruffle formation and phagocytosis , although its correspondence to the membrane curvature is unclear [ 16 ] . Phagocytosis is dependent on the activation of the Rho GTPase family proteins , such as Cdc42 and Rac , which regulate actin polymerization by the Arp2 / 3 complex and the WASP family [ 17 , 18 ] . N - WASP dimerization improves Arp2 / 3 binding to VCA domain , this can occur efficiently due to the dimeric / oligomeric nature of BAR proteins [ 19 , 20 ] . Therefore , amphiphysin might provide an additional layer of WASP regulation through its SH3 - mediated binding . The membrane tubulation activity of amphiphysin in vitro was originally reported by Takei et al . [ 13 ] . Moreover , amphiphysin tubulation activity was also found in T - tubules [ 21 ] . T - tubules are invaginations of the external membranes of skeletal and cardiac muscle cells , which are rich in ion channels required for excitation - contraction coupling . Amphiphysin - 2 , a variant of the BAR protein , is highly expressed in skeletal muscle , and is localized on T - tubules [ 22 ] . Interestingly , this variant lacks the binding sites for clathrin and the clathrin adaptor AP - 2 , and instead comprises a polybasic sequence ( encoded by exon 10 ) that enhances its affinity for the plasma membrane by electrostatic interactions [ 22 ] . Amphiphysin - 2 , in cooperation with other proteins , plays a critical role in the induction and stabilization of this unique organelle . Genetic disruption of the only amphiphysin gene in Drosophila disrupts the T - tubule network [ 21 ] , and missense mutations in the human gene encoding amphiphysin - 2 cause myopathies [ 23 ] . In addition , amphiphysin - 2 ( BIN1 ) tubulates membranes , either by itself or cooperatively with dynamin 2 ( DNM2 ) [ 13 , 24 ] . The cooperation between BIN1 and DNM2 is mediated by the interaction of the BIN1 SH3 domain with the proline - rich domain of DNM2 . However , this interaction may not occur prior to the association of BIN1 with membranes , since the polybasic sequence binds to the SH3 domain when it is not membrane - bound [ 25 ] . Indeed , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding is necessary to release the SH3 domain from the poly - basic region , enabling the interaction between the SH3 domain and DNM2 . The existence of this intermolecular regulation was elucidated in cultured cells [ 25 ] . 2 . 2 . Endophilin Endophilins are composed of an N - terminal BAR domain and a C - terminal SH3 domain . The BAR domain of endophilin A1 forms a wedge at the center of the BAR domain dimer , which is thought to be inserted into the membrane [ 10 , 26 , 27 ] . Endophilin participates in clathrin - dependent endocytosis via the BAR and SH3 domains as well as the uncharacterized “fast mode” of endocytosis [ 28 ] . The Membranes 2012 , 2 96 endophilin SH3 domain interacts with dynamin , N - WASP , and the phosphoinositide phosphatase synaptojanin [ 8 , 29 ] . A recent study suggests that Endophilin BAR domain dimerization on membranes triggers the access of ligands to the SH3 domain [ 30 ] . Recently , by using knock - out mice of all three endophilin A isoforms , it was demonstrated that all three endophilins , A1 , A2 , and A3 , are involved in the recycling of synaptic vesicles at the uncoating stage of CCVs ( clathrin - coated vesicles ) , rather than the scission of CCPs ( clathrin - coated pits ) . This result is consistent with a role for Endophilin in Synaptojanin recruitment , not for dynamin recruitment or vesicle fission [ 8 ] . There are several possible links between diseases and endophilin A . Interestingly , it was recently reported that the SH3 domain of endophilin A binds with high affinity to Parkin , a protein linked to Parkinson’s disease [ 31 ] , and also to huntingtin and ataxin - 2 , two additional proteins implicated in neurodegenerative diseases [ 32 ] . Endophilin 1 , 2 double knock - out mice develop neurodegerative disease leading to epileptic seizures [ 8 ] . In contrast to endophilin A , endophilin B1 , also known as Bif1 or SH3GLB1 , interacts via its N - BAR domain with Beclin 1 , the mammalian homologue of yeast Atg6 ( autophagy - related gene 6 ) , through the UVRAG protein ( UV irradiation resistance - associated gene ) . This interaction regulates the formation of autophagosomes , by promoting the activation of phosphatidylinositol ( 3 ) kinase C3 ( PI3 kinase C3 ) [ 33 ] . Endophilin - B1 participates in the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology . The depletion of endophilin - B1 , by using short - hairpin RNAs , leads to the dissociation of the outer mitochondrial membrane and the formation of vesicular and tubular structures from the remnants of this membrane [ 34 ] . These results were phenocopied by the knockdown of the dynamin homolog Drp1 ( dynamin - related protein 1 ) , a protein implicated in mitochondrial fission . Thus , Drp1 and endophilin - B1 may function in concert , and perhaps interact directly , in the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology [ 34 ] . Endophilin - B1 may also interact with Bax , Bcl2 - associated X protein , to promote apoptosis following cytokine withdrawal [ 35 ] . However , in contrast to endophilin A1 , there have been no reports of interaction of endophilin - B1 with N - WASP . 2 . 3 . Sorting Nexins Sorting nexins contain the BAR domain and the PX domain , but only SNX9 and 18 contain the SH3 domain . The BAR domain of the sorting nexin , SNX9 , is in the proximity of the PX domain , which specifically recognizes phosphoinositides , such as PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . The BAR and PX domains function as one unit with broad phosphoinositide specificity [ 36 , 37 ] . The roles of the BAR domains in the other SNX proteins have not been well studied . The PX domain shows affinity for various phosphoinositides , but it may also be involved in protein – protein interactions [ 38 ] . The BAR - PX unit of SNX9 also deforms membranes into tubules , and SNX9 is involved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis and endosomal trafficking [ 36 , 37 , 39 ] . SNX9 and the closely related SNX18 are accessory proteins required for the fission of clathrin - coated endocytic vesicles [ 40 ] . The SH3 domain of SNX9 binds to N - WASP and dynamin [ 39 ] . The SNX9 protein participates in the Arp2 / 3 complex activation by N - WASP , in the presence of liposomes [ 41 ] . SNX1 and SNX2 function in endosome trafficking . Although SNX1 and SNX2 lack the SH3 domain for N - WASP binding , another Arp2 / 3 complex activating protein , WASH , reportedly associates with SNX1 and SNX2 [ 35 , 36 ] . Membranes 2012 , 2 97 2 . 4 . Tuba Tuba contains the BAR domain , four N - terminal SH3 domains , a DH domain and two C - terminal SH3 domains . The four N - terminal SH3 domains exhibit strong affinity for dynamin , the DH domain is a Cdc42 GEF , and the C - terminal SH3 domains bind directly to the N - WASP and Ena / VASP proteins . Tuba is localized at synapses and dorsal ruffles . The membrane deformation induced by the BAR domain of Tuba has not been elucidated yet [ 42 , 43 ] . The role of Tuba in apical junction formation in epithelial cells dependent on Cdc42 and N - WASP is demonstrated [ 44 ] . Tuba is also shown to be required for epithelial cyst morphogenesis [ 45 ] . 2 . 5 . APPL1 APPL1 , Centaurin , and ASAP1 are composed of the BAR and PH domains . Among the three proteins , ASAP1 also contains an SH3 domain ( Figure 3 ) . The PH domain is a module for phosphoinositide recognition . APPL1 is present on endosomal vesicles derived from clathrin - mediated endocytosis and on macropinosomes [ 46 ] . The dissociation of APPL1 from endosomes is reportedly correlated with the recruitment of PI ( 3 ) P binding proteins , such as WDFY2 and EEA1 , to endosomes [ 47 ] . The BAR domain of APPL1 binds not only to lipids but also to small GTPases , using different surfaces . BAR domains of APPL1 / 2 interact with Rab5 , which regulates endosomes maturation and fusion [ 48 ] . In addition , in response to extracellular stimuli , such as epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , APPL1 and 2 translocate from the membrane to the nucleus , where they interact with the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase complex ( NuRD / MeCP1 ) and thus regulate cell proliferation [ 49 ] . The release of the APPL proteins from endosomes and their subsequent translocation to the nucleus occur in a Rab5 - dependent fashion , and GTP hydrolysis by Rab5 is required to release APPL [ 49 ] . 2 . 6 . ASAP1 ASAP1 is an ArfGTPase activating protein ( GAP ) containing a BAR domain . The PH domain of ASAP1 binds to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , which stimulates the GAP activity [ 46 , 50 , 51 ] . The proline - rich domain of ASAP1 binds to Src [ 52 ] and CrkL [ 53 ] . These Src and CrkL proteins also participate in the formation of the podosome . Podosomes facilitate cell migration and tissue invasion by immune cells . Invadopodia are related structures in invasive cancer cells . And ASAP1 is required for podosome formation in NIH3T3 cells . Furthermore , the Src - dependent phosphorylation of ASAP1 on Tyr - 782 is necessary for podosome formation [ 51 ] . The SH3 domain of ASAP1 can also bind to cortactin and FAK [ 51 ] , although interactions with N - WASP and dynamin were not reported . However , another study showed that ASAP1 interacts through its BAR domain with the C - terminal region of GEFH1 , a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RhoA , and thus inhibits podosome formation [ 54 ] . Therefore , further studies are required to clarify the role of ASAP1 in podosome formation . ASAP3 , which is closely related to ASAP1 , is associated with focal adhesions and circular dorsal ruffles , but is not localized to podosomes [ 55 ] . The reduction of ASAP3 expression results in fewer actin stress fibers , reduced levels of phosphorylated myosin , and slower cell migration and invasion . Conversely , the down - regulation of ASAP1 has no effect on either migration or invasion [ 56 , 57 ] . Membranes 2012 , 2 98 2 . 7 . PICK1 PICK1 contains a PDZ domain , but lacks an SH3 domain . The BAR domain of PICK1 reportedly interacts with the Arp2 / 3 complex to suppress the nucleation of actin filaments , thereby inhibiting the endocytosis of neurotransmitter receptors . The PDZ domain of PICK1 interacts directly with lipid membranes containing phosphoinositides , and the PDZ – lipid interaction is necessary for synaptic transmission [ 58 – 60 ] . The interplay between the BAR and PDZ domains of PICK1 has been reported [ 61 ] . Experimental observations suggested that the PICK1 - PDZ domain inhibits the activity of the PICK1 - BAR domain , and this auto - inhibition can be released by PICK1 - PDZ ligand binding [ 62 , 63 ] . 3 . F - BAR Domain Subfamily The F - BAR - domain - containing proteins exist in all eukaryotes , except plants . These proteins are also known as Pombe / Cdc15 homology ( PCH ) - family proteins , from the founding member of this family ( Figure 4 ) . Figure 4 . Domain organization of F - BAR proteins . EFC : extended FER - CIP4 homology ( EFC ) or FCH and BAR ( F - BAR ) domain ; HR1 : Protein kinase C - related kinase homology region 1 domain ; SH2 : Src homology 2 domain ; SH3 : Src homology 3 domain ; FX : F - BAR extension domain ; Tyr - kinase : Tyrosine kinase domain ; RhoGAP : Rho GTPase activating protein domain ; C1 : Protein kinase C conserved region 1 . 3 . 1 . FCHo1 and FCHo2 The F - BAR domain of FCHo2 also forms a crescent - shaped dimer , but the curvature of its Membranes 2012 , 2 99 membrane - binding , concave surface is smaller than those of the F - BAR domains of CIP4 and FBP17 [ 64 ] . Correspondingly , the FCHo1 / 2 proteins were required for the initiation of clathrin assembly at the plasma membrane through binding to the scaffold proteins for clathrin - coated pits , such as eps15 and intersectin , which in turn recruit the adaptor complex AP2 for clathrin assembly [ 65 ] . 3 . 2 . FBP17 , CIP4 , and Toca - 1 The structures of the F - BAR domain from CIP4 and FBP17 were the first to be solved , among the F - BAR domains [ 66 ] . The amino acid sequence of the F - BAR domain of Toca - 1 / formin binding protein 1 - like ( FNBPIL ) is almost identical to those of CIP4 and FBP17 [ 66 – 68 ] . Toca - 1 was identified biochemically as an essential component of Cdc42 - mediated actin polymerization [ 69 ] . The diameter of tubules generated by the F - BAR domains of CIP4 and FBP17 is much larger than that induced by the BAR domains of amphiphysin and endophilin , and appears to correspond to the curvature of the initial stages of clathrin - coated pits [ 66 – 68 ] . An isomeric variant of CIP4 , CIP4h ( also known as CIP4 / 2 ) was identified , and both CIP4h and CIP4 reportedly function directly in the translocation of GLUT4 during endocytosis [ 70 , 71 ] . CIP4 regulates insulin signaling downstream of TC10 GTPase , via recruitment of GAPex - 5 to inactivate Rab31 leading to increased GLUT4 vesicle trafficking to the cell surface [ 72 ] . However , CIP4 was shown to inhibit GLUT4 trafficking to the cell surface using both knock - down and knock - out approaches [ 71 , 73 ] . Resolving these conflicting findings may require resolving CIP4’s role in endocytosis and exocytosis of GLUT4 . The SH3 domains of FBP17 and CIP4 bind to dynamin , which antagonizes the tubulation activities of FBP17 and CIP4 [ 67 , 68 ] . The SH3 domain also binds to N - WASP , which functions downstream of Cdc42 . In addition to the F - BAR domain , FBP17 , Toca - 1 and CIP4 possess Cdc42 , Rnd2 and / or TC10 binding sites ( HR1 domain : homology region 1 ) [ 69 , 70 , 74 , 75 ] . Toca - 1 , FBP17 , CIP4 , and Cdc42 are involved in regulating the activation of N - WASP [ 67 – 69 , 76 ] . CIP4 reportedly associates with the proline - rich domain of Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) in macrophages and CIP4 can regulate localization of WASP in macrophages [ 77 , 78 ] . FBP17 , CIP4 , and Toca - 1 are involved in a variety of structures , in addition to clathrin - coated pits . The F - BAR and SH3 domains of FBP17 are essential for the formation of podosomes and phagocytic cups in macrophages [ 79 ] . The microinjection of a CIP4 mutant lacking its SH3 domain resulted in the inactivation of podosome formation in macrophages , suggesting a critical role for the CIP4 / WASP interaction [ 80 ] . Moreover , the F - BAR and SH3 domains of FBP17 are necessary for recruiting the WASP - WIP complex and dynamin - 2 to the plasma membrane [ 67 , 79 , 81 , 82 ] . In macrophages , FBP17 interacts with the WASP - WIP complex and dynamin - 2 to form podosomes , through its F - BAR and SH3 domains . Therefore , complex formation between the F - BAR domain of FBP17 and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 may be required for the membrane localization of FBP17 as well as the WASP - WIP complex and dynamin - 2 , to determine where podosomes will form [ 79 ] . CIP4 localization to invadopodia was reported in breast cancer cells [ 83 ] . Notably , CIP4 is involved in the surface expression of transmembrane type 1 matrix metalloprotease ( MT1 - MMP ) , an important metalloprotease for matrix degradation at the podosome . CIP4 is reportedly phosphorylated by Src at the linker region between the HR1 domain and the SH3 domain [ 84 ] . Tyrosine phosphorylation at Y471 by Src is important for matrix degradation as well as invasion in breast tumor cells [ 84 ] . Src Membranes 2012 , 2 100 kinase inhibits endocytosis of MT1 - MMP to promote cell invasion , which is partly explained by phosphorylation of BAR proteins [ 85 ] , first shown by Wu et al . ( 2005 ) to involve disruption of Dynamin binding to Endophilin following SH3 domain phosphorylation by Src . This observation is consistent with CIP4 phosphorylation by Src to reduce MT1 - MMP internalization [ 84 , 85 ] . Although Toca - 1 is thought to have a concave membrane - binding surface , the role of F - BAR domain - containing proteins , such as Toca - 1 , in filopodia formation has been suggested by reconstitution assay [ 86 ] . This might occur through membrane binding to the neck region of filopodia , in a similar manner to PACSIN , as described in the next section [ 86 , 87 ] . CIP4 also reportedly functions in lamellipodia , although the mechanism is unclear [ 88 ] . Knock - out mice experiments revealed that CIP4 is essential for optimal GC ( germinal center ) formation , skin inflammation , and integrin - dependent T - cell migration [ 89 ] . Toca - 1 promotes vesicle motility , filopodia and lamellipodia formation by recruiting N - WASP or Abi1 , respectively [ 90 – 92 ] . Toca - 1 / FNBPIL is essential for autophagy of the intracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium [ 93 ] . The interaction between Toca - 1 and ATG3 ( autophagy protein ) occurs through the Toca - 1 HR1 domain [ 93 ] . Moreover , CIP4 was proposed to be involved in endosomal trafficking [ 94 ] . In terms of their relationships to diseases , the SH3 domains of CIP4 bind to the huntingtin protein , which is mutated in patients with Huntington disease [ 95 ] . CIP4 has been implicated in renal cancer , where a mutation causes the expression of a truncated CIP4 fragment including the F - BAR domain and lacking the SH3 and HR1 regions [ 96 ] . Recent studies implicate CIP4 family proteins in cancer cell invasion [ 79 , 83 , 84 , 92 ] , and will require extension to tumor metastasis studies in animal models . 3 . 3 . PACSIN ( Syndapin ) The syndapins ( synaptic dynamin - associated proteins ) , also known as PACSINs ( PKC and casein kinase substrate in neurons ) , have three isoforms . Whereas PACSIN1 is restricted to neurons , PACSIN2 is ubiquitously expressed and PACSIN3 is present in lung and muscle tissues [ 97 ] . PACSINs have been implicated in the regulation of both clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 98 , 99 ] and caveolae endocytosis [ 100 , 101 ] . PACSINs contain an N - terminal F - BAR domain and a C - terminal SH3 domain . The F - BAR domains of PACSINs have a hydrophobic wedge [ 102 , 103 ] . Overexpression of the SH3 domain of syndapins inhibits receptor - mediated endocytosis [ 104 ] . Structurally , PACSINs have a concave membrane - binding surface , as in the other F - BAR domains , such as FBP17 , CIP4 , and FCHo2 [ 102 , 103 ] . Therefore , the inward membrane tubulation is a natural outcome of its membrane binding . The membrane tubules induced by the PACSIN F - BAR are narrower than those induced by the F - BAR domains of FBP17 and CIP4 , which correlates with the structural differences between these proteins [ 100 , 103 ] . The narrower diameter of the tubules suggests that PACSIN2 is involved with the clathrin - coated pit at a transient , late stage of clathrin - coated vesicle fission . PACSIN2 is also localized at caveolae , which typically have a narrower neck diameter than clathrin - coated pits [ 100 , 101 ] . The direct binding of the PACSIN2 F - BAR domain with caveolin - 1 supports the role of PACSIN2 in caveolae . However , overexpression of the full - length protein generates microspikes and lamellipodia - like structures , as well as cellular invaginations [ 102 , 105 ] . For protrusions such as microspikes , the Membranes 2012 , 2 101 concave membrane - binding surface might fit to the neck of protrusions , where the same positive curvatures were found . The PACSIN2 F - BAR domain alone appears to be localized at these necks [ 102 ] . The SH3 domain of PACSIN2 / syndapin II also binds to N - WASP and dynamin [ 98 ] . The SH3 domain seems to contribute to the auto - inhibition of PACSIN1’s membrane tubulation ability . The basic patch on the F - BAR domain interacts with a corresponding acidic surface on the PRD - binding RT loop of the SH3 domain [ 106 ] . Interestingly , such charge complementarity is also used by the PxxP motifs within SH3 domain ligands , such as dynamin1 [ 107 ] . On the other hand , the intermolecular interaction between F - BAR domains can compete with the intramolecular SH3 / F - BAR interaction [ 106 ] . These intramolecular interactions have recently been observed with BAR domain - containing proteins Endophilin , where Endophilin BAR domain dimerization on membranes is suggested to trigger the access of ligands to the SH3 domain [ 30 ] . Thus , perhaps the SH3 domain does not inhibit the BAR domain , but this curvature sensing domain triggers the appropriate subcellular space to engage with its ligand . In addition , the SH3 domains of PACSIN1 bind to huntingtin protein , which is mutated in patients with Huntington disease [ 108 ] . 3 . 4 . NOSTRIN NOSTRIN contains an F - BAR domain and an SH3 domain , and is reportedly localized at caveolae . The SH3 domain of NOSTRIN binds to N - WASP and dynamin [ 109 , 110 ] . However , the structure of the NOSTRIN F - BAR domain has not been reported . Patients with alcoholic hepatitis had significantly high hepatic levels of NOSTRIN . NOSTRIN induces the intracellular translocation of endothelial NO synthase ( eNOS ) and reduces NO generation , indicating that NOSTRIN expression is regulated under pathologic conditions [ 111 ] . 3 . 5 . Fes and Fer The Fes / Fps and Fer proteins are a distinct family of non - receptor tyrosine kinases , with prominent roles in inflammation and immunity [ 112 – 114 ] . Fes / Fps and Fer have a kinase region , an SH2 domain , an F - BAR extension ( FX ) domain and an F - BAR domain . The kinase region resembles those of the Src family tyrosine kinases . The region adjacent to the Fes or Fer F - BAR domain binds to phosphatidic acid ( PA ) , and was named the FX domain . The F - BAR and FX units act as a membrane binding module with a preference for PA , and the F - BAR and FX units are essential for the membrane - dependent activation of the Fer kinase activity , which is involved in lamellipodia formation and cell migration [ 115 ] . The structure of the F - BAR - FX unit has not been determined . Recent study shows that Fes not only binds PA , but to phospholipase D2 ( PLD2 ) , leading to increased differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells [ 116 ] . Fer was localized to microtubule ends , and it can phosphorylate the adhesion molecule platelet / endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 ( PECAM - 1 ) [ 117 ] . Fes signaling in stromal cells promotes breast tumor growth and metastasis [ 118 ] . Fes expression was also recently shown to have prognostic value for recurrence of prostate cancer [ 119 ] . Fer was recently linked to resistance of lung adenocarcinoma cells to quinicrine , an anti - malarial drug with anti - cancer properties [ 120 ] . Fer and a truncated Fer isoform ( FerT ) have recently been implicated in promoting growth and survival in colon cancer cell lines [ 121 ] . Membranes 2012 , 2 102 3 . 6 . srGAPs The slit - robo GAP proteins , ( srGAP ) 1 – 4 , contain an F - BAR domain at the N - terminus , a RhoGAP domain in the middle and an SH3 domain at the C - terminus [ 122 , 123 ] . The specificity of the GAP activity on small GTPases differs among the srGAP1 – 4 proteins . The SH3 domain often binds to WASP / WAVE proteins . srGAP1 binds to WASP , and inactivates Cdc42 . In this respect , srgp - 1 ( nematode ortholog of mammalian srGAP ) senses membrane invaginations through its BAR domain , and is involved in cell corpse clearance and sick - cell killing in C . elegans [ 124 ] . srGAP2 binds to N - WASP and inactivates Rac [ 123 , 125 ] . srGAP3 / WRP binds to WAVE1 , and inactivates Rac [ 122 ] . The overexpression of the F - BAR domain - containing fragment of srGAP2 induced filopodia - like protrusions without actin filament localization , in a similar manner to the overexpression of the I - BAR domain of IRSp53 . However , its membrane - binding mechanism is still unclear [ 123 ] . A recent mutational analysis revealed that the predicted concave surface does not bind membranes [ 126 ] . The srGAP3 gene is deleted in a severe type of mental retardation [ 127 ] . 3 . 7 . GAS7 GAS7 contains the SH3 domain and the F - BAR domain . The SH3 domain is located at the N - terminus of the F - BAR domain , and this is the unique characteristic of GAS7 . The structure of the F - BAR domain is unknown . The SH3 domain binds to N - WASP [ 128 ] . GAS7 plays a role in neuronal development [ 128 ] , and its ability to cross - link actin and modulate actin dynamics can induce cell protrusions [ 129 ] . 3 . 8 . PSTPIP1 / 2 and Cdc15 PSTPIP1 was first identified as a tyrosine phosphorylated protein associated with F - actin [ 130 ] . PSTPIP1 contains an F - BAR domain and an SH3 domain , and the latter domain interacts with WASP and a tyrosine phosphatase [ 131 ] . The structure of its F - BAR domain is unknown . Mutations in the PSTPIP1 gene cause a rare autoinflammatory disease ( PAPA syndrome ) . Two mutations ( E250Q and A230T ) were found in the BAR domain of patients with PAPA syndrome , although the effects of these mutations on PSTPIP1 function have not been clarified [ 132 ] . PSTPIP2 shares about 41 % sequence homology with its counterpart , PSTPIP [ 131 ] . PSTPIP2 has only the F - BAR domain , and no other domain was identified . Two sites of tyrosine phosphorylation and a binding site for PTP - PEST are found in both PSTPIP1 and PSTPIP2 [ 131 ] . Recently , PSTPIP2 has been linked to filopodium formation , through its putative F - actin bundling activity [ 133 ] . However , the role of the membrane - binding F - BAR domain in filopodium formation has yet to be investigated . It was shown that PSTPIP2 regulates the organization of the actin cytoskeleton , as well as macrophage morphology and motility , in response to Colony Stimulating Factor - 1 ( CSF - 1 ) [ 133 ] . PSTPIP2 interacts with F - actin and increases cortical actin bundling . In vitro , PSTPIP2 induces F - actin bundling , decreases the actin polymerization rate , and increases F - actin stability [ 133 ] . Moreover , PSTPIP2 reportedly binds phospholipids and deforms the plasma membrane into narrow tubes in COS - 7 cells [ 67 ] . In whole animals , the anti - inflammatory role of PSTPIP2 was shown in mouse model studies [ 134 , 135 ] . Mice with PSTPIP2 mutations that cause reduced expression levels ( cmo and lupo ) Membranes 2012 , 2 103 leads to fatal autoimmune disease due in part to hyperactivation of macrophages [ 136 ] . PSTPIP1 is localized to the cleavage furrow of cultured human cells [ 137 ] . PSTPIP1 is highly homologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc15 , but lacks the long linker region between the F - BAR domain and the SH3 domain present in Cdc15 . Cdc15 is localized at the contractile ring and is essential for cytokinesis [ 138 – 140 ] . The phosphorylation of Cdc15 controls its function in cytokinesis . On the other hand , phosphorylation at many sites within Cdc15 generates a closed conformation , which inhibits Cdc15 assembly at the division site in interphase . Conversely , Cdc15 dephosphorylation induces an open conformation , oligomerization , and scaffolding activity during mitosis [ 141 ] . Cdc15 was described originally as an SH3 domain - containing protein that regulates actin nucleation , through the recruitment of formin Cdc12 and type I myosin Myo1 to the contractile ring by its F - BAR domain [ 142 ] . Cdc15 also stabilizes the contractile ring through its SH3 domain [ 143 ] . F - BAR domains are also found in various other Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins such as Cyk2 / Hof1 , Bzz1 and Rgd1 – 2 and Schizosaccharomyces pombe proteins such as Imp2 , YB65 ( pombe Bzz1p ) and Rga7 – 9 [ 144 , 145 ] . Hof1 is localized at the site of cell division where septin is present . In addition , the deletion of the F - BAR domain of Hof1 reportedly caused defective actomyosin ring contraction [ 146 ] . 4 . I - BAR Subfamily The I - BAR domain binds to the membrane through its convex surface . The I - BAR domain , with the inverted geometry of the membrane - binding surface , as compared to most BAR and F - BAR domains , is involved in the plasma membrane protrusions of filopodia and lamellipodia . The structures of the I - BAR domains from IRSp53 , MIM , and Pinkbar have been determined [ 147 – 150 ] ( Figure 5 ) . Figure 5 . Schematic of domain organization of I - BAR proteins . IRSp53 - MIM homology domain ( IMD ) / inverse - BAR ( I - BAR ) ; CRIB : Cdc42 - Rac interactive binding region ; SH3 : Src homology 3 domain ; WH2 : Wasp homology 2 ( verprolin homology ) domain . 4 . 1 . IRSp53 In vitro , the incubation of the I - BAR domain with liposomes induced membrane invaginations , which corresponded geometrically to cellular protrusions [ 148 ] . The binding of the I - BAR domain to Membranes 2012 , 2 104 these membrane structures was confirmed by cryo - electron microscopy [ 151 ] . The I - BAR interaction with the membrane occurs through phosphatidylserine , but a preference for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 was observed for the I - BAR of IRSp53 [ 148 , 149 , 151 ] . The overexpression of the I - BAR fragment alone induced highly dynamic membrane protrusions that even persisted in the presence of an actin polymerization inhibitor [ 148 , 149 , 152 , 153 ] . Furthermore , several regions without actin filaments were also observed in these protrusions [ 148 , 154 ] . When the full - length proteins were overexpressed , the induced protrusions contained actin filaments , presumably because the SH3 domain recruits proteins that bundle and / or induce the formation of actin filaments . Interestingly , the SH3 domain of IRSp53 binds to the Arp2 / 3 activator , WAVE2 , which plays essential roles in lamellipodium formation , and also to N - WASP , which is considered to function in filopodium formation and endocytosis [ 155 – 157 ] . The SH3 domain also binds to MENA and VASP , which promote actin polymerization without branching [ 157 – 159 ] . The IRSp53 SH3 domain reportedly binds to dynamin [ 157 ] , but the significance of dynamin in membrane protrusions is still unclear . Several laboratories have confirmed I - BAR binding to the actin filament , though its significance in relation to membrane deformation is unclear [ 147 – 149 ] . IRSp53 also has a PDZ binding motif , and its interactions with several PDZ domain - containing proteins may be important for the assembly of some cellular structures [ 160 – 163 ] . In cells , IRSp53 is involved in both filopodium and lamellipodium formation , as suggested from the localization and the binding of WAVE2 , N - WASP , VASP , and Mena [ 155 , 156 , 158 , 159 ] . Filopodia are regulated by the small GTPase , Cdc42 . IRSp53 contains a Cdc42 - binding motif and seems to be required for the Cdc42 - induced formation of filopodia [ 157 ] . This latter activity might also depend on its association with another cytoskeletal modulator , epidermal growth factor receptor kinase substrate 8 ( Eps8 ) , which is known to function in actin - capping and - bundling [ 164 ] . In addition , an analysis with N - WASP knockout cells indicated that the IRSp53 - mediated formation of filopodium - like protrusions requires N - WASP , but its Arp2 / 3 complex activating ability was not involved in the protrusion formation , and thus IRSp53 might be sufficient for unbranched actin filament formation in filopodia [ 157 ] . The siRNA - mediated knockdown of IRSp53 also revealed its role in lamellipodia formation [ 156 ] . Moreover , IRSp53 is required , in association with the WAVE2 - Abi1 complex , for various actin - mediated processes such as lamellipodium formation , but not for the formation of filopodia [ 165 ] . The lamellipodia - like structures induced by WAVE2 and IRSp53 are involved in phagocytosis [ 165 , 166 ] . In Dictyostelium discoideum , the IBARa protein ( which contains an I - BAR domain ) is involved in curvature sensing , and its SH3 domain recruits regulators of actin polymerization , including the Arp2 / 3 complex , at the neck of a particle during phagocytosis [ 167 ] . 4 . 2 . MIM MIM and ABBA lack an SH3 domain . Both MIM and ABBA are composed of a C - terminal actin - monomer binding WH2 ( WASP homology 2 ) domain and an N - terminal I - BAR domain . The WH2 domain of MIM directly binds to actin [ 168 , 169 ] . In addition to its induction of a negatively curved membrane , the I - BAR from MIM also has a wedge for insertion into a membrane enriched in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , which it then deforms into tubular structures in vitro [ 148 , 149 , 151 ] . MIM enhances Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization through interactions with cortactin , but inhibits Membranes 2012 , 2 105 WASP - mediated actin polymerization [ 169 ] . MIM is strongly expressed during development in muscles and postmitotic neurons , and in adult mice in the kidneys , liver , and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum [ 168 , 170 ] . Mouse model studies revealed that MIM deficiency leads to a progressive kidney disease characterized by abnormal tubular morphology , severe urine concentration defects , renal electrolyte wasting and bone abnormalities [ 171 ] . Interestingly , MIM was recently also implicated in the Sonic hedgehog ( Shh ) signaling pathway . Shh is a potent morphogen that controls many developmental processes , including left – right asymmetry and organ patterning . Ectopic or dysfunctional Shh signaling has been linked to many cancers [ 172 ] . 4 . 3 . Pinkbar Pinkbar ( planar intestinal - and kidney - specific BAR domain protein ) contains an I - BAR domain and an SH3 domain . The I - BAR domain of Pinkbar is noticeably shorter ( 164 Å ) than those of IRSp53 ( 182 Å ) [ 147 ] and MIM ( 185 Å ) [ 173 ] . The I - BAR domain of Pinkbar interacts with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich vesicles through electrostatic interactions . Due to its flat structure , the BAR domain of Pinkbar does not induce membrane protrusions or invaginations , and instead deforms phosphoinositide - rich membranes into planar structures [ 150 ] . The binding partner for the SH3 domain has not been identified . Pinkbar is expressed predominantly in intestinal and kidney epithelial cells , where it localizes to Rab13 - positive vesicles and to the plasma membrane at the cell - cell junctions [ 150 ] . The small GTPase , Rab13 , is highly expressed in the intestinal epithelial cells and promotes tight junction integrity [ 174 , 175 ] . Therefore , Pinkbar may be involved in the formation of specific membrane structures at the intercellular junctions of enterocytes that may regulate intestinal permeability or nutrient absorption . 5 . Conclusions We have summarized the current information available for the well - studied BAR proteins . More than 50 different types of BAR proteins are present in humans , and therefore we still lack a complete understanding of the membrane curvature generation and sensing mediated by BAR proteins . Several BAR proteins are associated with multiple structures , and thus the BAR proteins may simply function for the generation and recognition of membrane curvature , and might not have one - to - one relationships to subcellular structures . The various combinations of BAR proteins for each subcellular structure may provide its characteristic membrane shape . Acknowledgement S .
