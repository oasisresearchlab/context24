In this respect , the plasma mem - brane is a principal cell compartment responsible for plant adaptations to stresses . It is capable of remodeling its protein composition by means of endocytosis . In the plants , the main mode of this process is a clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Several clathrin - independent pathways are also known ; these alternative mechanisms involve Flot1 protein . In the present research , the role of Flot1 in the endocytosis process was examined in seedling roots of a wild type and an Atflot1ko knockout mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana ( L . ) Heynh . Light microscopy with an FM4 - 64 lipophilic probe and transmission electron microscopy were used . It was found that endocytosis was arrested in the root cells of the wild type after a simultaneous treatment of the roots with an inhibitor of clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( 1 - naphthylacetic acid ) and the agent depleting the plasma membrane of sterols ( methyl - β - cyclodextrin ) . In this case , such morphological change as reduction in cyto - plasm vesiculation ( including the early endosomes , the small vesicles originated from the agranular ER , the microvacuoles from its fragments , and the clathrin vesicles ) was observed . The vesiculation was diminished in both the control and the stressed plants ( exposed to 100 mM NaCl ) . In the Atflot1ko mutant , the cisterns of the Golgi complex closed up to a ring , and the process of formation of the early endosomes was completely abolished under these conditions . It is suggested that , in the roots of A . thaliana exposed to the inhibitors , the microdomain - associated Flot1 protein of the plasma membrane conserves the structure of the Golgi complex and its capacity to build early endosomes on the trans - side . In addition , the protein appears to participate in formation of the early endosomes from the trans - Golgi network .

Salt stress is a striking example of such colli - sion . Departure from homeostatic conditions is often harmful to cells’ life and gives rise to an array of stress reactions leading to adaptations and survival of the cells under unfavorable conditions [ 1 ] . Plasma mem - brane ( PM ) is recognized to be a central compartment involved in cellular adaptation because it is situated as a barrier between inner and outer media of the cells [ 2 ] . Dynamic remodeling of the PM is a chief process in cellular adaptation to various stressors . Controlled exchange of molecules and signals through this barrier is driven by transmembrane proteins such as channels , transporters , and receptors [ 3 ] . Proteins are removed from the PM by internalization of membrane areas into vesicles in the course of endocytosis [ 4 ] . Within the endosomes , this material is then sorted for degra - dation or back recycling onto the cell surface . The metabolized proteins , together with the newly synthe - sized ones , are secreted in a form of transport vesicles for replenishment of functionally active proteins of the plasma membrane [ 5 ] . Several mechanisms of plant endocytosis are revealed . They are distinguished by a specific set of proteins at different sites along an endo - cytic pathway [ 4 ] . Of them , the most prominent is a clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) associated with invaginations of the PM producing vesicles that are rich in proteins to be transported [ 6 ] . These vesi - cles are covered with clathrin and are intended for translocation of their cargo into endosomal compart - ments [ 7 ] . A considerable share of the emerging vesi - cles may stay unripe , which hampers the absorption process and transfer of a cargo . CME is a strictly con - trolled process to fulfill only the transport function .

RESEARCH PAPERS 74 Page 2 of 10 RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY Vol . 70 : 74 2023 KHALILOVA , VORONKOV To date , the most usable method of visualization and evaluation of a rate of endocytosis involves FM4 - 64 lipophilic dye . It easily penetrates into root cells by endocytosis and fluoresces only in a membrane - bound state enabling estimation of transport streams through the membrane [ 8 – 10 ] . Monitoring the FM4 - 64 endo - cytosis shows that a disturbance of CME ( by means of a dominant - negative form of clathrin ) sharply dimin - ishes the total internalization of the PM material . Consequently , this pathway may dominate in the plant cells . CME is found to function in all the cells of the A . thaliana root , pointing to a global significance of the process in plant physiology [ 11 , 12 ] . Compounds inhibiting CME in yeasts and animals also strongly inhibit endocytosis in plants [ 11 , 13 ] . In latter case , they suppress the CME process by prevent - ing interactions between loaded proteins and clathrin - recruiting adapter protein complexes [ 14 ] . Auxins , exerting unspecific influence on CME , can increase their own outflow that stabilizes membrane proteins ( e . g . , PIN ) and , consequently , arranges their polar transport in the tissues [ 15 , 16 ] . Different effects of aux - ins on PIN transport in the cells were revealed with the help of their isoforms , 1 - naphthylacetic acid ( NAA ) in preference [ 15 – 17 ] . Most of yet examined transmembrane proteins obey the clathrin - mediated pathway of uptake , which operates in all the cellular layers of the A . thaliana roots [ 12 , 16 , 18 ] . All the same , alternatives of CME exist in the plants . The clathrin - independent endocytic pathway ( CIE ) , aiming at the membrane - bound but not transmembrane proteins , was found in the root epi - derm of this plant under regular growth conditions [ 12 ] . It was also revealed that salt stress induces another clathrin - independent pathway for the transmembrane and membrane - bound ( GPI - anchored ) proteins . This path depends on sorting the vacuolar proteins of the ADP - ribosylation actor , i . e . , the factor of guanidine ( ARF - GEF ) 6 exchange . This observation conforms to the salt stress - stimulated CIE of the plasma membrane protein—transmembrane aquaporin 2 ; 1 ( PIP2 ; 1 ) [ 12 , 19 ] . Therefore , a particular endocytic pathway , which deals with a plant protein , is not fixed and depends on many factors , including localization of a cell , state of its development , signals / stimuli , and environmental factors . One of CIEs is a flotillin - mediated endocyto - sis . The membrane rafts of the PM , rich in sphingolip - ids and cholesterol , are ordered microdomains con - taining the unique flotillin protein ( Flot1 ) . Knock - down of flotillin - 1 inhibits an uptake of GPI - bound proteins [ 20 ] . In A . thaliana , the membrane micro - domain - associated endocytosis , driven by Flot1 , par - ticipates in regulation of signal transduction by endo - cytosis [ 19 , 21 – 23 ] . Earlier we found that , in the mutant overexpressing the flot1 gene , the number of dictyosomes is reduced in the Golgi complexes ( GC ) and they are deformed to give annular structures on the trans - side of the GC ; these phenomena are espe - cially distinct under salinization . Such changes in the GC may reflect an activation of vesicular transport and forced consumption of materials on the trans - side of the GC necessary for building of endosomes [ 24 ] . Although the functions of flotillins are poorly investigated in plants in comparison with other kingdoms , the involve - ment of these metabolites in some processes was also reported in plant organisms . However , some facts show very low incidence of the Flot1 - related invaginations . This agrees with the fact that the endocytosis rate of cholera toxin is independent of flotillin exhausting [ 25 ] . CIE of the anchored GPI proteins in animal cells crucially depends on the level of sterol components in the membrane [ 26 ] . The pretreatment of seedling roots with methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( MCD ) —the agent depleting the plasma membrane of sterols [ 19 , 27 ] — reduces the uptake of FM4 - 64 in the epidermal cells of the A . thaliana root [ 12 ] . MCD can remove sterols from the PM causing its exhaustion that , in turn , weakens the dynamics of phosphorilation , dimerisa - tion , and internalization of plant proteins [ 28 ] . The goal of this study was to demonstrate the involvement of Flot1 protein in the formation of early endosomes ( EE ) on a trans - side of the Golgi complex . For this purpose , the wild type ( WT ) of A . thaliana and its knockout mutant in the flot1 gene were compared as regards the effects of the endocytosis inhibitors on the cells of seedling roots . The influence of the inhibitors on the root cell ultrastructure was also examined . MATERIALS AND METHODS Objects . Plants of the WT of Arabidopsis thaliana ( L . ) Heynh . ( Col - 0 ecotype ) and its Atflot1ko knockout mutant ( SALK _ 205125C ) were studied . The data on the insertion and characteristics of the mutant we reported earlier [ 29 ] . The plants were grown on an agarized 50 % MS medium with 0 . 5 % sucrose at 23 ± 2 ° C , RH 70 ± 5 % , under a 16 - h daily illumination at 80 μmol / ( m 2 s ) provided by LB - 80 luminescent lamps ( Philips , Poland ) . For all experiments , 5 - day - old seedlings were sampled . Staining with FM4 - 64 . The seedlings were incu - bated in 1 mL of a liquid 50 % MS medium without sucrose , pH 5 . 8 , with 2 μМ of the FM4 - 64 endocyto - sis dye for 30 min at room temperature . In the salt - treated counterpart , the medium contained 100 mM NaCl . Later , the seedlings were transferred onto microscope slides for observation under an AxioIm - ager Z2 microscope . The microscopic equipment and software were purchased from Carl Zeiss , Germany . Images were taken with an AxioCamMRm highly sen - sitive AxioCamMRm monochrome camera using an AxioVision 4 . 8 program . Fluorescence of FM4 - 64 ( red pseudocolor ) was detected with a set of light fil - ters no . 14 ( excitation at 510 – 560 nm and emission above 590 nm ) . The average intensity of pixels of the cytosolic side of the cells , including the plasma mem - brane , was measured using a ZEN Blue program . At least 50 images were analyzed in each location .

Seedlings were preincubated for 30 min in 1 mL of a liquid 50 % MS medium without sucrose , pH 5 . 8 , containing 100 μM NAA ( Sigma cat . no . N1641 , Great Britain ) . Then 2 μM FM4 - 64 was added followed by additional 30 - min incubation at room temperature . In the salt - treated counterpart , 100 mM NaCl was added together with FM4 - 64 . In the case of a combined treatment with 100 μM NAA and 10 mM MCD ( Sigma cat . no . 128446 - 36 - 6 , China ) , these com - pounds were simultaneously added to the 50 % MS medium in which the seedlings were then preincu - bated for 30 min at room temperature . The next pro - cedures were the same as those after the treatment with sole NAA . The images were microscopically pro - cessed as upon the staining with FM4 - 64 . Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) was used to investigate an ultrastructure of the root cells of the A . thaliana WT and the Atflot1ko mutant . The samples were prepared according to the standard protocol [ 24 ] . Root pieces ( 2 – 3 mm in length ) were cut off at a dis - tance of 1 – 2 mm from a root tip . They were fixed in 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde for 3 h and later in 1 % OsO 4 at 4 ° C for 1 day . The fixing solutions were prepared in 0 . 05 M cacodylate buffer , pH 7 . 2 . The fixed samples were sequentially dehydrated in ethanol ( 30 and 40 % two times , 15 min each ; 50 and 60 % two times , 30 min each ; and 70 % at 4 ° C for a night ) . The next day , the samples were transferred to 96 % ethanol for 1 h ; 100 % ethanol : 100 % acetone ( 1 : 1 , v / v ) for 1 h ; 100 % ace - tone for 1 h , and finally to the mixture of epoxy resin ( Fluka , cat . no . 2920114 , Germany ) and 100 % acetone at the 1 : 8 , 1 : 4 , and 1 : 1 ( v / v ) ratios . Ultrathin slices were prepared from the polymerized samples at an Om U3 ultramicrotome ( Reihert , Austria ) . The slices , placed onto nets , were contrasted with 1 % uranyl ace - tate for observations . A LIBRA 120 microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Germany ) was used . Statistics . The Statistica 10 ( StatSoft ) program was used to perform a factor analysis of variance with a posteriori HSD criterion for unequal samples . The histogram represents means and their SDs . Different letters indicate the means that significantly differ from each other at P < 0 . 05 . RESULTS General endocytosis in the root cells of 5 - day - old A . thaliana seedlings of the WT and the Atflot1ko knockout mutant was monitored . For this purpose , we estimated an intracellular accumulation of the FM4 - 64 endocytosis reporter whose hydrophobic molecules are bound to lipids of the PM . The absorbed dye is internal - ized with the help of the endocytic vesicles [ 30 ] . Fluorescence of FM4 - 64 In the root elongation zone of the Atflot1ko mutant , the fluorescence was two times brighter than in the WT regardless of the presence of 100 mM NaCl in the medium ( Fig . 1 , Supplementary Information , Fig . 1 ) . Meanwhile , the rate of the dye internalization in both plant genotypes was not altered by the addition of sodium chloride in agreement with our previous results [ 28 ] . The contact of the seedlings with 2 μM FM4 - 64 markedly stimulated the endocytosis of the dye by the root cells of the mutant in the examined root zone . In the absence of salt , the pretreatment of the WT roots with 100 μM NAA inhibited the endocytosis by 70 % . The addition of 100 mM NaCl to the medium restored the FM4 - 64 fluorescence of the WT plants to the control level ( Fig . 1 ) . Importantly , the cell mem - branes remained outlined with FM4 - 64 ; therefore , the application of NAA did not interrupt the access of the dye to all the root cells ( Supplementary Informa - tion , Fig . 1 ) . In the salt - free incubation medium , the pretreat - ment of the Atflot1ko mutant with NAA inhibited the endocytosis of the dye by 35 % . The presence of NaCl did not change the dye internalization by the root cells in comparison with the control level ( Fig . 1 ) . Either the WT or knockout mutant , simultaneously treated with MCD ( liberating sterols from the PM ) and NAA , manifested a dramatic decrease in the FM4 - 64 fluorescence . Namely , in the salt - free medium , this decrease was as large as 84 % of the con - trol level in the wild type and 82 % in the mutant . In the presence of NaCl , the fluorescence signal also decreased—by 76 % and 75 % in the WT and the mutant , respectively ( Fig . 1 ; Supplementary Informa - tion , Fig . 1 ) .

In addition , in the NaCl - treated WT roots , the adsorption of FM4 - 64 , which was insensitive to NAA , was strongly suppressed upon simultaneous application of NAA and MCD ( Fig . 1 ; Supplemen - tary Information , Fig . 1 ) . The combined treatment of the roots blocked the salt - stimulated absorption of FM4 - 64 in the wild type . Transmission Electron Microscopy In the ultrastructure of the root cells in the elonga - tion zone of the 5 - day - old seedlings of A . thaliana , both the WT plants and the Atflot1ko knockout mutant in the flot1 gene ( Figs . 2a – 2c ) , we did not find differ - ences from the cells of the described earlier [ 29 ] mat - uration zone under either normal or salt - stressed con - ditions ( 100 mM NaCl ) . In the WT seedlings , the treatment of the roots with auxin resulted in the less curved PM ( Figs . 2g – 2i ) and its tight abutment to the cell wall except for rare areas , where the exosomes ( ES ) conglomerated between the PM and the peri - plasmatic space ( PS ) ( Fig . 2h ) . The trans - Golgi net - work ( TGN ) actively produced EE on the trans - side ( Fig . 2h ) . In the control , the well - developed endoplas - mic reticulum looked like branched tubes ( Figs . 2a – 2f ) . NAA also influenced its structure so that the lumens increased and the tubes turned into the cisterns fol - lowed by their fragmentation . Small fragments of the ER gave rise to multiple angular - shaped microvacuoles ( MV ) ( Fig . 2i ) . The tonoplast became more flexuous ( Figs . 2g – 2i ) probably due to the intensified vesicular transport towards the vacuole and the increased total area of the membrane . Under the control conditions , the active state of the TGN demonstrated the general increase in the cytoplasm vesiculation ( Figs . 2h , 2i ) and the activation of the exocytosis process in the root cells of the seedlings under the inhibition of CME . Such intense vesiculation did not occur in the WT plants that were not exposed to either auxin or sodium chloride ( Figs . 2a – 2c ) . The addition of 100 mM NaCl to the incubation medium entailed some changes in the cellular ultra - structure . Under these conditions , the treatment with auxin caused a deformation of the TGN with an emer - gence of semiannular structures ( Figs . 2k , 2l ) ; how - ever , the large EE actively arose on the trans - side of the GC ( Fig . 2k ) in comparison with the control . Lumens also dilated in the ER , and no fragmented sections of the ER were seen in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 2l ) . The decrease in the general vesiculation and in the cytoplasm vacuolization , caused by the salt treatment of the WT roots , is a consequence of a reduction in the intense formation of vesicles and an activation of the exocytosis towards the vacuole ( Figs . 2j – 2l ) . If NaCl was present but auxin absent in the incubation medium , the cytoplasm vacuolization was enhanced in the root cells of the WT seedlings ( Figs . 2d – 2f ) . The Atflot1 knockout mutant plants , subjected to NAA , did not display evident ultrastructural differ - ence between the control and salt - treated variants . However , in the salt - free medium , the PM of the mutant was not flexuous and was closely adjacent to the cell wall except for rare areas of the PS where the ES concentrated ( Figs . 3g – 3i , 3i - inset ) . The TGN deformed to produce annular structures ( Figs . 3g , 3h ) unlike the root cells of the WT incubated under the same conditions ( Figs . 2g – 2i ) . Singular endosomes arose on the trans - side of the GC . The lumens were expanded in the ER , which was not fragmented ( Figs . 3h , 3i ) . The cytoplasm was not vacuolated . Addi - tion of NaCl to the incubation medium and the treat - ment of the mutant seedlings with NAA did not mark - edly change the ultrastructure ( Figs . 3j – 3l ) in compar - ison with the control seedlings ( Figs . 3g – 3i ) . All the same , under salinization , the TGN completely closed up and , thus , blocked the EE formation on the trans - side . In the same but NAA - free medium , the GC pre - served its structure , and the process of the EE forma - tion was pronounced on the trans - side ( Figs . 3d – 3f ) . The simultaneous treatment of the WT seedlings with NAA and MCD did not appreciably change the cell ultrastructure similarly to the action of NAA alone . In the absence of salt , the GC actively unlaced the EE from its trans - side ( Figs . 2m – 2o ) . The extension of ER , its fragmentation , and formation of small irregularly shaped MV resulted in the increased vesiculation and vacuolization of the cytoplasm ( Figs . 2m – 2o ) . Addition of 100 mM NaCl to the medium had the same effect on the root cell structure of the WT plants as well as the addition of only NAA under salinization ( Figs . 2p – 2r ) . It should be noted that the WT plants manifested the changes in the GC ultrastructure only in the presence of salt upon the treatment with NAA alone or in com - bination with MCD . In the knockout mutant simultaneously treated with NAA and MCD under the control conditions , the cytoplasm vesiculation and vacuolization were generally enhanced at the expense of formation of the larger EE on the trans - side of GC and extension of the lumens of ER accompanied by emergence of irregu - larly shaped MV ( Figs . 3m – 3o ) . Under salinization , the vesiculation of the cytoplasm became less distinct , the TGN closed to a ring , and there was no activity on Fig . 2 .

In the ER , we did not reveal fragmentation and extension of the lumens ( Fig . 3r ) unlike the case of the seedling treatment with NAA alone ( Fig . 3l ) . Therefore , all the described changes in the root cell ultrastructure were rather caused by the action of NAA alone than the double action of the tested agents . Addition of NaCl to the incubation medium dimin - ished the cytoplasm vacuolization of in both the WT and the knockout mutant . DISCUSSION Membrane transport in eukaryotic organisms includes complicated networks of vesicular transport systems connecting almost any intracellular compart - ment in many directions . An internal transport is mainly mediated by clathrin , while the transporting vesicles , originating from PM , may fulfill different mechanisms . These endocytic vesicles are variable in size , from 60 to 200 nm as a rule [ 30 , 31 ] . After the for - mation , the vesicles merge and exchange with their load in the prevacuolar compartment , in particular , in TGN / EE [ 32 , 33 ] . We did not earlier find differences in a rate of FM4 - 64 absorption in the root cells of the maturation zone of the WT and the knockout mutant in the pres - ence or absence of NaCl in the medium [ 29 ] . Different processes of endocytosis ( clathrin - mediated and clathrin - independent ) are known to occur in different root zones and different cellular layers [ 12 ] . In the present study , the elongation ( growth ) zone of the root was examined . In this part of a plant , the cells lengthen out to large extent . The degree of elongation is maxi - mal in the central part of the zone . This process requires a permanent active supply of substances , including membrane material , which is delivered through the vesicular transport ( endo - and exocytosis ) proceeding in both directions in the cell . Only the clathrin - mediated endocytic pathway is well - characterized in the plants because of the avail - ability of its specific chemical inhibitors NAA , Tyr - A23 , and HUB1 [ 11 , 18 ] . Each of these agents effec - tively blocks absorption of the majority of transmem - brane proteins ( PIN2 , LTI6b , and PIN1 ) indicating the exclusiveness of this mechanism for such proteins . The clathrin - mediated pathway constitutively oper - ates in all cellular layers of the root [ 12 ] . To reveal effects of auxin on a vesicular transport , the NAA synthetic form is usually employed since it is more stable than the IAA natural form [ 15 , 16 ] . Auxins influence endocytosis , to be correct , its clathrin - mediated pathway . This is evidenced by an auxin - mediated inhibition of the internalization of the FM4 - 64 endocytic indicator [ 8 ] and by diminishment of its signal in the cells [ 15 , 16 ] . Thus , an addition of 100 μM NAA to an incubation medium almost abol - ishes the intracellular FM4 - 64 signal [ 34 ] . In the pres - ent work , NAA at this concentration maximally inhib - ited CME in the cells of both plant lines ( Fig . 1 , Sup - plementary Information , Fig . 1 ) . The treatment of the WT seedlings with auxin strongly ( by nearly 70 % ) sup - pressed CME , while the effect was as little as approxi - mately 15 % in the knockout mutant ( Fig . 1 ) . Presum - ably , the CME pathway dominates in the root cells of the mutant , where the complete arrest of this process would disturb transport functions of the entire cell . However , it is not excluded that these plants possess alternative CIE pathways ( for instance , a receptor - mediated endocytosis ) that does not involve Flot1 . The fact that the addition of 100 mM NaCl to the incubation medium did not increase the signal of the knockout mutant agrees with the enhancement of CIE under salinization with involvement of Flot1 protein [ 19 , 21 ] . The TEM observations revealed the changes in the cell ultrastructure of both the WT ( Figs . 2g – 2l ) and the knockout mutant ( Figs . 3g – 3l ) upon treatments of seedlings with NAA . It appears that NAA at high con - centration ( 100 μM ) efficiently inhibits the CME and strongly affects the endomembrane system , including its morphology , e . g . , the TGN deformation and ER fragmentation . Under the control conditions , exoge - nous auxin caused agglomeration of the ES in the PS ( Fig . 3h ) that , in turn , indicates the active process of endocytosis occurring in the WT root cells . In the salt - treated roots of the WT , the FM4 - 64 signal might increase at the expense of a redistribution of the streams of the vesicular transport—activation of CIE and direction of endocytosis towards the vacuole . The clathrin - mediated and clathrin - independent endocytic pathways operate everywhere in the root cells of A . thaliana [ 12 ] . In this plant species , treat - ment of the root tips with auxins diminishes the rate of CME and inhibits adsorption of the PIP2 ; 1 mem - brane protein [ 19 , 21 , 35 ] . However , the PIP2 ; 1 endo - cytosis can also proceed independently of clathrin through a nanodomain - mediated pathway . In fact , the salt stress ( caused by 100 mM NaCl ) enhances a joint localization between PIP2 ; 1 and nanodomain perma - nent Flot1 protein [ 19 ] . This conforms to our results , that is , the endocytosis inhibition with NAA in the WT and the enhancement of the FM4 - 64 signal by exoge - nous sodium chloride ( Fig . 1 ) .

Addition of NaCl to the medium did not increase the intracellular signal of the marker . This means that all the endocytic pathways—additional or induced by various factors—are sensitive to one or another of these agents . Microdomains of membranes enriched with sterols and sphingolipids can modulate localization and activity of certain membrane - associated proteins [ 36 ] . Flotillins are found in membrane rafts of the PM in Arabidopsis pointing to its possible link with the sterol - rich domains [ 21 ] . Flotillins , present in the rafts , are the components of the detergent - resistant membranes ( DRM ) . If the DRM fraction , isolated in a sucrose gradient , is treated with MCD [ 37 ] this leads to exhausting of phytosterols and elimination of a float - ing fraction of the DRM from the gradient of sucrose density . Most likely , this is accounted for by a distur - bance in the DRM properties [ 38 ] , while the global protein composition of the PM remains unchanged after the treatment with MCD [ 27 ] . Presumably , depletion of free phytosterols in the PM , resulting from the root treatment with MCD , entails a complete removal of the DRM fraction and , to some extent , dis - ruption of the membrane heterogeneity , in particular , in the sterol - rich domains . This means that phytos - terols appear to play key roles in the PM for structur - ization of lipid rafts by arrangement of acyl chains of lipids and their translocation as recruiting platforms for membrane proteins , including Flot1 . Therefore , the reported changes in the cell ultrastructure of the tested lines of A . thaliana ( TGN deformation and ER fragmentation ) , caused by auxin ( sole or combined with MCD ) , may be attributed to the changes in levels and / or composition of free sterols in the entire mem - branes . The combined application of NAA and MCD to the roots of the Atflot1ko knockout mutant strongly inhibited the CME . In this case , few EE and MV , pres - ent in the cytoplasm under salt - free conditions , com - pletely disappeared upon addition of 100 mM NaCl to the medium . It seems that the salinization caused rapid merge of the formed EE with each other and / or the vacuole . In addition , the GC cisterns closed up into a ring that , in turn , blocked the process of the EE formation on the trans - side . We demonstrated here the that the presence of Flot1 protein in the microdomains of the PM in the root cells conserves the structure of GC and its poten - tial to form EE on its trans - side upon inhibition of CME and root treatment with MCD under either nor - mal conditions or salinization . A similar action of a mixture of auxin and MCD on the roots of the knock - out mutant strongly deformed the structure of its TGN . Exogenous sodium chloride abolished the TGN capability of forming vesicles on the trans - side . Therefore , we can infer that the functioning of the Flot1 microdomain protein of the PM maintains the structure of the GC in the root cells of A . thaliana and participates in the EE formation from TGN .
