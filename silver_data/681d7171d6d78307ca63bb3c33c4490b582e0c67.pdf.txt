Weisman Received : 7 January 2010 / Accepted : 1 March 2010 / Published online : 13 April 2010 # Springer Science + Business Media , LLC 2010 Abstract Acute inflammation is important for tissue repair ; however , chronic inflammation contributes to neurodegen - eration in Alzheimer ' s disease ( AD ) and occurs when glial cells undergo prolonged activation . In the brain , stress or damage causes the release of nucleotides and activation of the G q protein - coupled P2Y 2 nucleotide receptor subtype ( P2Y 2 R ) leading to pro - inflammatory responses that can protect neurons from injury , including the stimulation and recruitment of glial cells . P2Y 2 R activation induces the phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , a response dependent upon the presence of a SH3 binding domain in the intracellular C terminus of the P2Y 2 R that promotes Src binding and transactivation of EGFR , a pathway that regulates the proliferation of cortical astrocytes . Other studies indicate that P2Y 2 R activation increases astrocyte migration . P2Y 2 R activation by UTP increases the expression in astrocytes of α V β 3 / 5 integrins that bind directly to the P2Y 2 R via an Arg - Gly - Asp ( RGD ) motif in the first extracellular loop of the P2Y 2 R , an interaction required for G o and G 12 protein - dependent astrocyte migration . In rat primary cortical neurons ( rPCNs ) P2Y 2 R expression is increased by stimulation with interleukin - 1 β ( IL - 1 β ) , a pro - inflammatory cytokine whose levels are elevated in AD , in part due to nucleotide - stimulated release from glial cells . Other results indicate that oligomeric β - amyloid peptide ( A β 1 - 42 ) , a contributor to AD , increases nucleotide release from astrocytes , which would serve to activate upregulated P2Y 2 Rs in neurons . Data with rPCNs suggest that P2Y 2 R upregulation by IL - 1 β and subsequent activation by UTP are neuroprotective , since this increases the non - amyloidogenic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein . Furthermore , activation of IL - 1 β - upregulated P2Y 2 Rs in rPCNs increases the phosphor - ylation of cofilin , a cytoskeletal protein that stabilizes neurite outgrowths . Thus , activation of pro - inflammatory P2Y 2 Rs in glial cells can promote neuroprotective responses , suggesting that P2Y 2 Rs represent a novel pharmacological target in neurodegenerative and other pro - inflammatory diseases .

Integrins Introduction Chronic neuroinflammation , associated with the pathogenesis and progression of Alzheimer ' s disease ( AD ) , occurs when glial cells ( i . e . , astrocytes and microglia ) undergo prolonged activation in response to oxidative stress . Oxidative stress is postulated to be an early event in the development of AD that is due to increased production of reactive oxygen species Supported by NIH grants AG18357 , DE07389 , and DE17591 .

Production of neurotoxic β - amyloid ( A β ) peptides , such as A β 1 - 42 , also is a widely accepted contributor to neurodegeneration in AD [ 10 , 11 ] , and oxidative stress can enhance A β production [ 12 ] leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal apoptosis [ 13 ] . Chronic inflammation occurs around β - amyloid plaques [ 14 , 15 ] , and has been associated with the activation by cytokines of receptors in glial cells that promote neuronal cell death [ 16 – 18 ] . Studies have shown that inflammation begins as a neuroprotective mechanism , but becomes neurodegenerative when sustained [ 19 – 22 ] . Chronic neuroinflammation occurs in brain pathologies including AD , trauma , and stroke and is characterized by increased glial cell migration and proliferation , and morpho - logical changes , including extensive cellular hypertrophy , fiber extension and increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) [ 23 , 24 ] . In the initial stages , neuro - inflammation limits brain damage by promoting the clear - ance of neurotoxic soluble β - amyloid peptide [ 25 , 26 ] . Activated glial cells migrate to the edge of an injured area and secrete cytokines , chemokines , and growth factors , and also upregulate antigens and cell adhesion molecules [ 27 , 28 ] . Glial cell activation in the central nervous system under physiological conditions facilitates axonal growth during development [ 29 ] . In adult brain , glial cell activation is critical for structural plasticity and repair of damaged brain cells [ 24 ] . In the chronic stages , neuroinflammation may exacerbate neurotoxic effects induced by the formation of glial - derived amyloid plaques [ 24 – 30 ] that contribute to neurodegeneration and loss of brain function in AD . Anti - inflammatory drugs have been shown to alter A β deposition in an animal model of AD [ 31 ] . Among the agents that can contribute to glial cell activation in AD , nucleotides released from the cytoplasm of oxidatively stressed cells have garnered little attention despite the fact that multiple nucleotide receptor subtypes are expressed in glial cells and neurons . Studies have shown that ATP release due to stretch - induced injury increases GFAP expression and proliferation in astrocytes [ 32 ] , and nucleotides cause responses indicative of astrogliosis in vivo [ 33 ] and in primary rat cortical astrocyte cultures [ 34 ] . Release of nucleotides has been proposed to occur by exocytosis of ATP / UTP - containing vesicles , facilitated diffusion by putative ABC transporters , cytoplasmic leakage , and electrodiffusional movements through ATP / nucleotide channels [ 35 ] . Our studies have shown that the G q protein - coupled P2Y 2 receptor subtype is an important mediator of neuro - inflammatory responses mediated by astrocytes . Nucleo - tides are present at millimolar concentrations in the cytoplasm and when released activate a variety of P2 nucleotide receptors in the brain that have nanomolar to micromolar affinities for nucleotides [ 36 ] . Therefore , a small amount of nucleotide released from damaged or oxidatively - stressed cells can activate P2 receptors [ 37 ] . It has been demonstrated that ATP released from the leading edge of the cell surface amplifies chemotactic signals and directs neutrophil orientation by feedback through P2Y 2 nucleotide receptors ( P2Y 2 Rs ) [ 38 ] . Our previous results indicate that the pro - inflammatory cytokine IL - 1 β upregu - lates P2Y 2 R expression in neurons [ 39 ] , which can be activated by released nucleotides ( unpublished data ) . Thus , the release of nucleotides in the brain is hypothesized to stimulate the generation of extracellular pro - inflammatory cytokines by astrocytes and microglial cells that promote the upregulation of neuronal P2Y 2 Rs . This review will discuss our findings relating to the mechanisms underlying the pro - inflammatory and neuroprotective effects mediated by P2Y 2 Rs in astrocytes and neurons and their potential relationship to the pathophysiology of AD . The P2 Receptor Family In the early 1970 s , it was reported that ATP was released into the extracellular space by stimulation of nonadrenergic , noncholinergic nerves to activate responses postulated to be mediated by P2 purinergic receptors for nucleotides [ 40 , 41 ] . Over the next few decades , it was recognized that activation of P2 receptors can modulate a variety of responses in cells of the mammalian central nervous system ( CNS ) , including neurotransmission , cell growth , and apoptosis [ 42 – 44 ] . It is now accepted that nucleotides are released from excitatory neurons , injured cells , cells undergoing mechanical or oxidative stress , aggregating platelets , degranulating macrophages , and astrocytes by exocytosis from ATP / UTP - containing vesicles , facilitated diffusion , or cytoplasmic leakage [ 35 – 38 , 45 – 50 ] . Extra - cellular nucleotides activate cell surface P2 receptors belonging to two structurally distinct families : the G protein - coupled P2Y receptors ( P2YRs ) and P2X receptors ( P2XRs ) that are ligand - gated ion channels . Eight P2Y receptor subtypes have been cloned and characterized to date , including the G q - coupled P2Y 1 , P2Y 2 , P2Y 4 , P2Y 6 , and P2Y 11 receptors , and the G i - coupled P2Y 12 , P2Y 13 , and P2Y 14 receptors [ 51 ] . Seven P2X receptors have been cloned and characterized as ligand - gated ion channels , including P2X 1 , P2X 2 , P2X 3 , P2X 4 , P2X 5 , P2X 6 , and P2X 7 receptors [ 52 ] . Activation of P2 receptors in neurons and glia under normal and pathological conditions regulates pro - inflammatory responses , ion transport , neurotransmis - sion and cell apoptosis , proliferation , and migration [ 42 – 44 , 52 – 54 ] . Therefore , P2 receptors in the CNS represent potential targets for pharmaceutical approaches to treat neurological disorders . Among these P2 receptor subtypes , our research has focused on the P2Y 2 R and its signaling Mol Neurobiol ( 2010 ) 41 : 356 – 366 357 pathways in the regulation of pro - inflammatory responses in astrocytes associated with reactive astrogliosis , and neuroprotective responses associated with neurite growth and stability and the non - amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) . The P2Y 2 Nucleotide Receptor Activation of the G q - coupled P2Y 2 R stimulates phospholi - pase C ( PLC ) and leads to the production of inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( IP 3 ) and diacylglycerol ( DAG ) [ 54 , 55 ] , second messengers for calcium release from intracellular storage sites and protein kinase C ( PKC ) activation , respectively . Interestingly , we have found that the P2Y 2 R by virtue of a Arg - Gly - Asp ( RGD ) motif in its first extracellular loop ( Fig . 1 ) can bind to α V β 3 / 5 integrins and enable UTP to stimulate G o and G 12 proteins leading to the activation the small GTPases Rac and Rho , respectively ( Fig . 2 ) [ 56 , 57 ] . Mutation of the RGD sequence to Arg - Gly - Glu ( RGE ) , prevents both integrin binding and UTP - induced activation of G o , G 12 , Rac and Rho by the mutant P2Y 2 R expressed in human 1321N1 astrocytoma cells that lack endogenous P2Y receptors . In 1321N1 astrocytoma cells , activation of the wild - type P2Y 2 R , but not the RGE - mutant P2Y 2 R , leads to cytoskeletal rearrangements and increases in cell migration , suggesting that association with α V β 3 / 5 is required for these P2Y 2 R - mediated responses . The P2Y 2 R also contains 2 PXXP motifs in the intracellular C - terminal domain that represent consensus Src - homology - 3 ( SH3 ) binding sequences ( Fig . 1 ) . Activation of the wild type P2Y 2 R expressed in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells induces the phosphorylation of Src and EGFR , responses that are attenuated for a mutant P2Y 2 R in which the SH3 A A D D D L G G P N T T I W W N M A A D D D D L L G G G P N T T I E W W N Y L GYRCRC H C D S T A F H P NF H C D P S S T W A V S C T L E Integrin H G D V F D D G N S T W R L V SL L E E binding d i K G F V F CL GG I S RA R S A F R extracellular domain K KC L L L P S R T T VY Y A Y Y Y V A R A V F SY Y L F T M A Y K extracellular N H F F F L L L L G M P P S S S S R T T T T V V V V Y Y Y Y L L L Y Y V V L L A V V V Y Y R V L T M A Y K V T P L R H F C C C C C D L L L L G G N N P P P Q S S S T V V V V Y Y AAA A LY A L L L L L A A F F V L F F L L L A A S S N C D H F C C C D L L L I I N P S S T V V V A A A A L L V V A A L L L L L A A F F VV A A L V V V L A L P L S C D V Y W H F F C C G I I I M M S R TT T T V Y Y Y L V A A L S V V A V C R A F L GQ intracellular RL Y C S H K C M R R T A A L R RA R L Q N T L Y K K G R A A V L R RR A R V L R F W D G P R R R VL LL P R A R F W K D P S R R R T L L S A L L Y P G G G A W T S A Y P G G KP FLNa binding site D I Q M T PP R G q protein binding D D D G I Q M T S S P L L G P A R R R R R T GDV T R L P P A A R R SH3 binding S S F L G D R S T E E Sites ( PXXP ) K I S S S F P T D D L R R R S T A G E E K I S N D L R T E Fig . 1 P2Y 2 R structure and domains : the P2Y 2 R is a seven pass transmembrane G protein - coupled extracellular nucleotide receptor . It is activated equipotently by ATP and UTP and has been shown to be upregulated in response to stress or injury in various cell types . Highlighted features include the consensus RGD integrin - binding domain ( in pink ) , positively - charged amino acid residues known to be involved in ATP / UTP binding ( in orange ) , two consensus PXXP SH3 domain binding sites ( in yellow ) , the FLNa binding site , the intracellular loops that regulate Gq protein binding , and two glycosylation sites 358 Mol Neurobiol ( 2010 ) 41 : 356 – 366 binding domains for Src in the intracellular C - terminus of the P2Y 2 R have been deleted [ 58 ] . Since the activated P2Y 2 R co - localizes with EGFR in the plasma membrane [ 58 ] , these findings suggest that the previously reported ability of the P2Y 2 R to regulate EGFR phosphorylation [ 59 , 60 ] is due to Src - dependent recruitment of the P2Y 2 R to a signaling complex containing EGFR , thereby inducing EGFR phosphorylation in response to P2Y 2 R ligands . These studies used kinase inhibitors to demonstrate that P2Y 2 R - mediated activation of the mitogen - activated pro - tein kinases ERK1 / 2 , is dependent on the kinase activities of Src [ 58 ] and EGFR [ 59 ] . Whereas the activities of ERK1 / 2 are important for P2Y 2 R - mediated cell / astrocyte proliferation [ 61 ] , the activity of another MAP kinase , p38 , is important for P2Y 2 R - mediated upregulation of adhesion molecules , such as vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 ( VCAM - 1 ) , which is involved in tight binding of mono - cytes to endothelial cells [ 62 ] and lymphocytes to epithelial cells [ 63 ] . In astrocytic cells , the p38 signaling pathway is also required for the P2Y 2 R to inhibit trauma - induced cell death [ 64 ] . Other studies indicate that EGFR signaling regulates neuronal survival by promoting cortical but not midbrain astrocyte apoptosis [ 65 ] , which suggests an endpoint for P2Y 2 R activation in the CNS . Additionally , it has been shown that the P2Y 2 R interacts directly with filamin A ( FLNa ) [ 66 ] , a crosslinking cytoskeletal mainte - nance protein [ 66 ] . The ability of the P2Y 2 R to regulate signal transduction via activation of integrins and growth factor receptors , in addition to PLC , suggests that P2Y 2 R activation could have significant physiological and pathophysiological conse - quences in a variety of cell types that express the P2Y 2 R . P2Y 2 Rs are expressed in epithelial cells , smooth muscle cells , endothelial cells , monocytes , macrophages , neutro - phils , and cardiomyocytes and in brain , heart , kidney , liver , spleen , placenta , and skeletal muscle tissue [ 35 , 36 , 55 , 67 – 70 ] . In cells derived from the peripheral and central nervous systems , P2Y 2 Rs also are expressed in immortalized astrocytes , NG108 - 15 neuroblastoma × glioma hybrid cells , Schwann cells , dorsal horn and cortical astrocytes , astrocy - toma cells , rat cortical neurons , microglia and oligoden - drocytes [ 37 , 54 , 71 – 74 ] .

For example , placement of a silicone collar around a rabbit carotid artery upregu - lates P2Y 2 R expression in smooth muscle and endothelium and upon activation of the P2Y 2 R in vivo promotes intimal thickening and monocyte infiltration due to increased smooth muscle cell proliferation and VEGF receptor - 2 - dependent upregulation of VCAM - 1 , respectively [ 62 , 67 ] . P2Y 2 R - mediated VCAM - 1 expression also promotes lym - phocyte adherence to salivary epithelial cell monolayers , a potential consequence of P2Y 2 R upregulation detected in a mouse model of Sjögren ' s syndrome , an autoimmune exocrinopathy that leads to salivary gland dysfunction [ 63 , 77 ] . The P2Y 2 R agonists ATP and UTP have been shown to stimulate the adherence of monocytes and neutrophils to endothelial cell monolayers [ 62 , 79 ] . P2Y 2 R activation also regulates the synthesis of superox - ide , prostaglandins , nitric oxide , and cytokines in response to the elicitors IFN - γ and LPS [ 34 , 37 , 38 , 55 , 80 , 81 ] . Very few studies have investigated the consequences of P2Y 2 R expression in the brain . We utilized in situ hybridization and reverse transcriptase – polymerase chain reaction to identify P2Y 2 R messenger RNA ( mRNA ) expression in normal rodent ( i . e . , rat , mouse , and gerbil ) brain slices , where expression levels were highest in the hippocampus ( i . e . , dentate gyrus ) and cerebellum [ 34 ] . P2Y 2 R mRNA expression was also detected in rat primary astrocytes and microglial cells , although rat primary neurons express very low levels of P2Y 2 R mRNA [ 37 , 39 ] . Under non - inflammatory conditions , P2Y 2 R expres - sion in neurons and oligodendrocytes is low , therefore , these cells are unresponsive to UTP [ 82 ] , unless the presence of the pro - inflammatory cytokine IL - 1 β increases functional expression of the P2Y 2 R in neurons [ 39 ] . P2Y 2 Receptors Regulate Neuroinflammatory Responses It is well accepted that nucleotides can be released into the extracellular milieu from aggregating platelets , degranulat - ing macrophages , excitatory neurons , and injured cells [ 35 , 49 , 50 ] . Under pathophysiological conditions in the brain and other tissues , extracellular nucleotides can be released in response to oxidative stress , ischemia , hypoxia or mechanical stretch [ 45 – 50 ] , consistent with the ability of released ATP and UTP to induce migration [ 67 , 68 , 83 , 84 ] and chemotaxis of microglial cells [ 85 ] and primary rat cortical astrocytes [ 86 ] . We have also determined that the amyloidogenic peptide , oligomeric A β 42 , whose levels are elevated in Alzheimer ’ s brain , induces the release of ATP from mouse primary cortical astrocytes ( Fig . 3 ) . Primary rat cortical astrocytes were isolated from postnatal 2 - to 3 - day old rat pups . Briefly , cerebral cortices were cut into very small pieces and incubated with trypsin - EDTA at 37°C for 7 min . The suspension was filtered through 85 μ m nylon mesh and centrifuged at ∼ 250 g for 5 min . The cell pellet was resuspended in DMEM with 10 % FBS , 100 IU / ml penicillin , 100 μ g / ml streptomycin and 7 . 5 μ g / ml fungi - zone , and transferred to T75 culture flasks . Cells were maintained in an incubator with 5 % CO 2 at 37°C and the medium was changed every two days . When cells reach ∼ 80 - 90 % confluence , flasks were shaken at 225 rpm for 6 h at room temperature to remove microglial cells . Then , 10 6 cells were seeded into 12 - well plates and cultured for 2 days when ATP release assays were performed . Our results showed that oligomeric A β 42 induces the release of endogenous ATP from rat primary cortical astrocytes ( Fig . 3 ) . The basal release of ATP , determined after incubation of cells in HEPES buffer supplemented with 200 μ M AOPCP , an inhibitor of 5 ’ - nucleotidase , was 7 . 9 , 7 . 8 , 4 . 2 and 5 . 9 nmoles / well for 1 , 2 , 4 and 10 min , respectively . After stimulation of the cells with oligomeric A β , the endogenous ATP release was14 . 2 , 28 . 7 , 21 and 29 . 2 nmoles / well , for 1 , 2 , 4 and 10 min , respectively , and results compared with controls were significantly different at 4 and 10 min ( p < 0 . 01 ) . Thus , pro - inflammatory conditions in AD that include oxidative stress and the increased production of A β 42 [ 4 – 14 ] , are likely to induce the release of P2Y 2 R agonists .

Cells were washed 3 times using the same buffer and then incubated for different time periods at 37°C with or without oligomeric A β .

P2 receptor activation in vascular smooth muscle and glial cells also has been shown to increase the release of pro - inflammatory cytokines , including IL - 1 β and IFN γ [ 76 , 87 , 88 ] . Since cytokine release is dependent on metalloprotease activation , we postulate that IL - 1 β release from astrocytes is dependent upon P2Y 2 R - mediated metal - loprotease activation ( see Fig . 2 ) . Consistent with this hypothesis , P2Y 2 R activation has been shown to activate the metalloproteases ADAM10 and ADAM17 in astrocy - toma cells , primary neurons and salivary epithelial cells [ 39 , 89 ] . P2Y 2 Rs Mediate Neuroprotective APP Processing The inflammatory cytokine IL - 1 β whose levels are elevated in AD [ 90 ] has been shown to upregulate functional expression of the P2Y 2 R in rat primary cortical neurons [ 39 ] . IL - 1 β release from astrocytes and microglia has been shown to be induced by exogenous ATP acting through the P2X 7 receptor , however , the contribution of other P2 purinergic receptors was not excluded [ 91 ] . In primary rat and mouse neuronal cultures , the P2Y 2 R is expressed at very low levels ( 39 , unpublished data ) . However , Il - 1 β induces an increase in P2Y 2 R expression by activating the NF - κ B signaling pathway , since Bay - 11 - 7085 , an irrevers - ible inhibitor of I κ B - α phosphorylation and thus NF - κ B activation , decreases IL - 1 β - induced P2Y 2 R expression levels in rat primary cortical neurons [ 39 ] . These results are consistent with the finding that the P2Y 2 R promoter contains an NF - κ B binding site that regulates P2Y 2 R transcription in intestinal epithelial cells [ 92 ] . Since the pro - inflammatory cytokine IL - 1 β upregulates P2Y 2 R ex - pression in neurons , it was somewhat surprising to find that the P2Y 2 R serves a potential neuroprotective role by stimulating the non - amyloidogenic processing of APP [ 89 ] and the activation of cofilin [ 56 ] , a cytoskeletal actin - binding protein that is known to promote dendritic spine growth and stabilization [ 26 , 93 – 95 ] ( Fig . 5 ) . Our findings indicate that P2Y 2 R activation stimulates the α - and γ - secretase - dependent proteolytic processing of APP to generate the non - amyloidogenic peptide soluble amyloid precursor - α ( sAPP α ) in both astrocytoma cells expressing the wild type P2Y 2 R [ 89 ] and in primary rat cortical neurons treated overnight with IL - 1 β [ 39 ] . Production of sAPP α from APP would be anticipated to decrease the production of amyloidogenic A β peptide , the main component of senile plaques in the AD brain [ 96 , 97 ] . APP is either proteolytically processed by β - and γ - secretases to release A β , or by α - and γ - secretases to produce sAPP α . APP is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is present in a variety of tissues , but predominantly in the brain [ 98 ] . APP contains an extracellu - lar N terminus and a short C - terminal region that lies in the cytoplasm . Within APP , a single membrane - spanning region of 39 - 42 amino acids represents A β [ 99 , 100 ] . Proteolytic cleavage of APP in vivo can occur at the amino terminus of the A β domain ( by β - secretase ) , within the A β domain ( by α - secretase ) , and at the C - terminus of the A β domain ( by γ - secretase ) [ 101 ] .

Nucleotides are released from oxidatively - stressed brain cells activat - ing P2Y 2 Rs in astrocytes and microvessels . Activation of endoge - nously expressed P2Y 2 Rs in glial cells leads to integrin - mediated cell migration ( via the P2Y 2 R RGD domain ) , which has been shown to be necessary for cell migration . Nucleotideinduced and integrin - dependent activation of Rho and Rac promotes glial cell migration , and P2Y 2 R - induced transactivation of growth factor receptors increases cell proliferation and pro - inflammatory gene expression Mol Neurobiol ( 2010 ) 41 : 356 – 366 361 precludes the potential release of amyloidogenic A β 1 - 42 from the same APP molecule . Although not determined in our studies , it has been reported that the membrane - retained fragment resulting from sAPP α release undergoes further cleavage and endocytotic processing [ 102 – 104 ] . The released sAPP α fragment has been shown to have both neurotrophic [ 105 ] and neuroprotective [ 106 – 109 ] activities , suggesting that the pro - inflammatory upregulation of P2Y 2 Rs in neurons may be beneficial . PKC - dependent and - independent pathways stimulated by several G protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) have been reported to induce sAPP α release [ 110 – 112 ] . Over - expression of the human M1 and M3 muscarinic receptors in HEK293 cells stimulates sAPP α secretion [ 113 ] . Subsequently , thrombin , bradykinin , glutamate , and seroto - nin ( 5 - HT ) receptors have been shown to regulate sAPP α release [ 114 – 118 ] . Other studies indicate that reduction in A β 42 is associated with receptor - mediated activation of sAPP α release [ 119 – 121 ] . We have found that P2Y 2 R activation stimulated α - secretase by the furin - dependent activation of two members of the ADAM ( for a disintegrin and metalloprotease ) family [ 39 , 89 ] , ADAM10 , the Kuz enzyme [ 122 ] and ADAM17 / TACE ( tumor necrosis factor - α converting enzyme ) , the protease responsible for releasing TNF - α from the plasma membrane [ 123 ] . The cleavage of pro - IL - 1 β into mature IL - 1 β is achieved by a cysteine protease belonging to the caspase family , the IL - 1 β - converting enzyme ( ICE ) , known to be activated by ATP [ 124 ] . P2Y 2 R - mediated Cytoskeletal Signaling in Primary Rat Neurons It has been demonstrated that ATP released from the leading edge of the neutrophil surface amplifies chemotac - tic signals and directs cell orientation by activation of the P2Y 2 R [ 38 ] . Our previous studies indicate that P2Y 2 R activation in astrocytoma cells promotes the formation of actin stress fibers and induces cell migration [ 56 , 57 ] , although little is known about the effect of P2Y 2 R activation on cytoskeletal functions in neurons . We found that treatment of primary cortical neurons from mice and rats with IL - 1 β induced P2Y 2 R upregulation ( 39 , unpub - lished data ) . Subsequent P2Y 2 R activation with UTP induces Rho and LIM kinase activation that increases the phosphorylation of the actin - depolymerization factor cofilin [ 56 ] , a response known to promote localized F - actin expansion and the stabilization of dendritic spines [ 56 , 94 , 95 , 125 , 126 ] . Since we have found that P2Y 2 R interaction with α v β 3 / 5 integrins mediates cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell migration in astrocytoma cells via activation of Rho kinase , we postulate that a similar pathway regulates cofilin phosphorylation in neurons ( Fig . 5 ) . Previous studies have shown that inhibition of cofilin activation by expressing a phosphomimetic mutant of cofilin ( cof - S3D ) prevented A β - induced spine loss [ 26 ] . Activation of the P2Y 2 R causes dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskel - eton in migratory cell types , and our results indicate that the P2Y 2 R directly binds FLNa , activates focal adhesion molecules , and induces the phosphorylation of cofilin , suggesting that P2Y 2 Rs utilize these signaling pathways to regulate actin cytoskeletal rearrangements that promote dendritic spine growth and stabilization in neurons . Conclusion The neuroprotective mechanisms underlying acute inflam - matory responses in the brain become neurodegenerative when sustained [ 19 – 21 ] , as occurs in brain pathologies including AD , trauma , and stroke [ 22 ] .

P2Y 2 R activation induces release of cytokines , which upregulate the expression of the P2Y 2 R . Additionally , extracellular nucleotides activate matrix metal - loproteases to increase production of the non - amyloidogenic APP fragment , sAPP - α . Activation of the P2Y 2 R also promotes binding of FLNa to the C - terminal domain of the receptor and phosphorylation of cofilin 362 Mol Neurobiol ( 2010 ) 41 : 356 – 366 cells and regulates a variety of intracellular signal trans - duction pathways via activation of integrins , growth factor receptors , and PLC to promote cytoskeletal rearrangements , cell migration and proliferation , associated with reactive astrogliosis in the AD brain . In neurons , upregulation of P2Y 2 Rs by IL - 1 β promotes the nucleotide - induced non - amyloidogenic processing of APP and the phosphorylation of cofilin , responses that are neuroprotective . Thus , the P2Y 2 R may represent a novel target for the prevention of neuronal damage in AD and related neuroinflammatory diseases . References 1 .
