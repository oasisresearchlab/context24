The essential features incorporated into the model are the anisotropic elasticity of the rods and the random geometry of the network . We show that there are three distinct scaling regimes , character - ized by two distinct length scales on the elastic backbone . In addition to a critical rigidiy percolation region and a homogeneously elastic regime we ﬁnd a novel intermediate scaling regime , where the elasticity is dominated by bending deformations . PACS numbers : 87 . 16 . Ka , 62 . 20 . Dc , 82 . 35 . Pq The elasticity of cells is governed by the cytoskele - ton , a partially crosslinked network of relatively stiﬀ ﬁl - aments forming a several 100 nm thick shell called the actin cortex [ 1 ] . While the statistical properties of single cytoskeletal ﬁlaments are by now relatively well under - stood [ 2 , 3 ] , theoretical concepts for the elasticity of stiﬀ polymer networks are still evolving . One major open question is to understand how stresses and strains are transmitted in such networks . In synthetic gels that are formed by rather ﬂexible chain molecules the response to macroscopic external forces is – on the level of single ﬁlaments – isotropic and entropic in origin . It is gen - erally believed that macroscopic stresses are transmit - ted in such a way that the local deformations within the network stay aﬃne , i . e . that the end - to - end distance of individual ﬁlaments follows the macroscopic shear defor - mation [ 4 ] . In contrast , the building blocks of the actin cortex are semiﬂexible polymers , whose hallmark is an extremly long persistence length ℓ p , which is comparable to the total contour length ℓ . As a consequence , the re - sponse of such stiﬀ polymers to external forces shows a pronounced anisotropy [ 5 ] . Consider a semiﬂexible poly - mer with one end clamped at a ﬁxed orientation . When forces are applied at the other end transverse to the tan - gent vector at the clamped end , the response may be characterized by a transverse spring coeﬃcient k ⊥ ( ℓ ) = 3 κ / ℓ 3 proportional to the bending modulus κ . Whereas this response is of purely mechanical origin , the linear response for longitudinal forces is due to the presence of thermal undulations , which tilt parts of the polymer contour with respect to the force direction . The corre - sponding eﬀective spring coeﬃcient k k ( ℓ ) = 6 κ 2 / ( k B T ℓ 4 ) is proportional to κ 2 / T indicating the breakdown of lin - ear response for very stiﬀ ﬁlaments . In a typical network one expects the distance between crosslinks ℓ c to be much smaller than the persistence length and ﬁlament length . Hence we have k k ( ℓ c ) / k ⊥ ( ℓ c ) = 2 ℓ p / ℓ c ≫ 1 , i . e . the elas - tic response of the ﬁlaments is indeed highly anisotropic . These anisotropic elastic properties of individual ﬁla - ments suggests that the macroscopic elasticty of networks will not only depend on the number of crosslinks and the density of ﬁlaments , but also on the geometry and archi - tecture of the network . For very regular networks such as a triangular lattice the longitudinal spring coeﬃcient k k will dominate the macroscopic moduli [ 6 ] since the net - work can not be strained without a change of the end - to - end distance of individual polymers . In other regular network architectures , the softer bending modes would be dominant [ 7 ] . Naturally , this will lead to a very dif - ferent prediction for the elastic modulus of the network . It is not at all obvious what type of network geometry ( elongation dominated versus bending dominated ) is rel - evant in less ideal structures with a signiﬁcant amount of disorder such as in typical cytoskeletal networks . As a ﬁrst step towards understanding the elasticity of stiﬀ polymer networks we consider a two - dimensional model deﬁned as follows ( see Fig . 1 ) . We generate the FIG . 1 : Typical networks at low and high density . Dangling bonds , not contributing to the elasticity , have been cut oﬀ . The stress distribution is shown in false colors ; the load on a ﬁlament increases from blue to red . The left picture is for ρ = 10 , system size L = 10 , and an aspect ratio α = 0 . 0001 . 99 . 99 % of the strain energy stored in bending modes . In con - trast , the right picture shows a network for ρ = 50 , L = 2 , and α = 0 . 01 , where only 5 % of the strain energy is in bending modes ; the remainder is stored in compression modes . For the choice of units see the main text . random network by placing N line - like objects of equal length ℓ on a plane with area A = L 2 such that both position and orientation of the ﬁlaments are uniformly randomly distributed . Periodic boundary conditions in 2 both directions are used . Upon increasing the line den - sity ρ = Nℓ / A there is a critical threshold ρ c for geo - metric percolation [ 8 ] . Numerical simulations [ 9 ] show that the correlation length ξ ∼ ( ρ − ρ c ) − ν of the in - cipient inﬁnite percolation cluster scales with a critical exponent ν = 4 / 3 , identical to the value obtained for random site percolation on a lattice [ 10 ] . Transport of scalar quantities like the conductivity is also in the same universality class as lattice models [ 11 ] . In order to study the transport of non - scalar quantities like shear stress we need to specify how forces are transmitted between the building blocks of the network . In our “Mikado model” the building blocks are homogeneous elastic rods char - acterized by a Young modulus E and a circular cross - section of radius r . Wherever two sticks intersect they are connected by a crosslink with zero extensibility . In the cytoskeleton one ﬁnds a variety of linker proteins with a range of mechanical properties [ 12 ] . Here we re - strict ourselves to crosslinks that either ﬁx the relative orientation of the rods ( “stiﬀ crosslinks” ) or allow free rotation ( “free hinges” ) . Similar to thermally ﬂuctuat - ing semiﬂexible polymers , the elastic response of a stick segment between two neighboring crosslinks is character - ized by length dependent force constants for compres - sion or elongation , k comp ( ℓ c ) = πr 2 E / ℓ c , and bending , k bend ( ℓ c ) = k ⊥ ( ℓ c ) = ( 3 / 4 ) πr 4 E / ℓ 3 c . The distance be - tween two crosslinks ℓ c shows a Poissonian distribution , where the average distance of crosslinks along a ﬁlament scales as the inverse of the line density , ¯ ℓ c = π / ρ [ 8 ] . While this is a purely mechanical model , it still captures the essential feature that for typical densities of the net - work the compressional stiﬀness is much larger than the bending stiﬀness , k comp ( ℓ c ) / k bend ( ℓ c ) = ( 4 / 3 ) ℓ 2 c / r 2 ≫ 1 . It leaves out steric eﬀects due to thermal ﬂuctuations of the ﬁlaments , which give rise to the plateau modulus in solutions [ 13 ] . Consider the energy of the network as a function of the deviations of the positions of all intersection points and the rod orientations at the intersection points from their initial values . For small deformations of the network , this function can be approximated by a quadratic form that vanishes for vanishing deviations , as—by construction— the undeformed network is not prestressed . To analyse the elastic properties of the model network , a shear de - formation respecting the periodic boundary conditions is enforced by demanding that corresponding points on the left and right boundary of the simulation cell un - dergo equal displacements while the displacements of cor - responding points on the upper and lower boundary of the cell must agree vertically but diﬀer horizontally by a distance ∆ = γL , where γ is the shear strain . The orien - tation of the rods at corresponding points on the bound - ary are required to be equal . The remaining degrees of freedom are then allowed to relax , i . e . the harmonic ap - proximation to the energy of the network is minimized in the presence of the constraints . The derivative of the resulting energy of the deformed state with respect to the strain γ is proportional to the shear modulus . In pinciple , this reduces the determination of the shear modulus of a given network to the solution of a linear equation . How - ever , for interesting parameters ( thin rods ) , the problem is numerically highly unstable as we are searching for the lowest point of a complicated high - dimensional val - ley with extremely steep slopes but hardly varying base altitude . This problem is best left to one of the com - mercially available ﬁnite element solvers which have seen many years of careful optimization and testing . The re - sults presented below were obtained using the program Nastran by MSC Software . In the following discussion we take the rod length ℓ as unit length and κ / ℓ 3 as unit for the elastic modulus . Then the independent parameters are the densitiy ρ , the system size L and the aspect ratio α = r / ℓ of the rods . Note that the latter is a measure of the relative magni - tude of compressional to bending stiﬀness . We start with an analysis of the elasticity close to the percolation threshold . For stiﬀ crosslinks we ﬁnd that the percolation threshold is the same for rigidity as for connectivity percolation , ρ c = 5 . 71 . For free hinges a higher line density of ﬁlaments is needed , ρ c = 6 . 7 , for the network to become rigid . This agrees well with re - cent results , ρ c = 6 . 68 , for stiﬀ ﬁber networks [ 14 ] , where the crosslinks are ﬁxed in space but the angles between the ﬁbers can vary . In both cases , we ﬁnd that the shear modulus G vanishes as the line density of sticks approaches the critical value ρ c , according to a power law G ∼ ( ρ − ρ c ) µ . For our numerical analysis on a ﬁnite lattice we expect the shear modulus to obey the following ﬁnite size scaling law G = L − µ / ν h ( L / ξ ) , ( 1 ) where the scaling function behaves as h ( x ) ∼ x µ / ν and h ( x ) ∼ 1 for large and small values of the scaling vari - able x = L / ξ , respectively . Fig . 2 shows that the data collapse works very well for densities ranging from values close to the percolation threshold ρ c up to ρ ≈ 20 . For the data shown , L ranges from 2 to 30 . For larger den - sities , systematic deviations are clearly visible . This will turn out to be a very interesting observation , as we will discuss in detail below . We get the best data collapse in the critical region if we choose the values 2 . 4 ± 0 . 2 and 2 . 3 ± 0 . 2 for the critical exponent µ / ν in the case of stiﬀ crosslinks and free hinges , respectively . Since the diﬀerence between the exponents is within the statisti - cal error , we can make no deﬁnite conclusion whether networks with free hinges and stiﬀ crosslinks belong to diﬀerent universality classes for elasticity percolation . The rigidity exponent µ ≈ 3 . 15 ± 0 . 2 is signiﬁcantly lower than in other classes of continuum percolation mod - els , like the “Swiss - cheese model” , where µ ≈ 5 [ 15 , 16 ] . It is also lower than the value µ ≈ 4 for lattice models with bond - bending forces [ 10 , 17 ] .

Note that for ﬁnite systems the shear modulus is also nonzero below ρ c ( lower branches in both plots ) . that the “Mikado model” constitutes a new universality class for rigidity percolation . Similar results have inde - pendently been found in Ref . [ 18 ] . Now we come back to the above mentioned system - atic deviations from the scaling law , Eq . 1 , at densities above ρ ≈ 20 . To understand these better , let us have a closer look at the shear modulus as a function of the elastic moduli of individual ﬁlaments for densities not too close to the percolation threshold . In this regime the shear modulus becomes independent of system size for moderately large systems ; for the following results we have chosen systems satisfying L / ξ ≥ 200 . Fig . 3 shows the shear modulus as a function of α for a se - ries of densities ; we have communicated a preliminary version of these data in Ref . [ 19 ] . Note that k bend ( ℓ ) is eﬀectively kept constant since we are measuring all elastic constants in units of κ / ℓ 3 .

Data are shown for free hinges . ingly diﬀerent regimes . For high densities and / or thick rods ( α & 0 . 1 ) , where compressional stiﬀness is lower or comparable to the bending stiﬀness ( lower right part of Fig . 3 ) , the shear modulus scales linearly with the ﬁla - ment compressional modulus and the number of ﬁlaments per unit area , G ∼ ( ρ − ρ c ) α − 2 . Such a linear regime has also been found in a series of studies on random ﬁber networks [ 20 ] . It is by now well established that the elas - tic modulus can be described quantitatively in terms of eﬀective medium models [ 21 ] . Hence , in the high line density regime the network behaves as a homogeneously elastic medium , dominated by the compressional mod - ulus of the individual ﬁlaments . As a consequence , lo - cal deformations follow a macroscopic shear in an aﬃne way . This has to be contrasted with the elastic behav - ior for slender rods with low aspect ratios ( α ≈ 10 − 5 for the higher densities ) , where bending becomes the softer mode . Then , one ﬁnds an extended plateau re - gion , which broadens signiﬁcantly with lowering the line density , where the shear modulus becomes completely in - dependent of k comp ( ℓ ) ∼ α − 2 k bend ( ℓ ) [ 19 ] . This strongly suggests that in this regime the macroscopic elasticity of the network is dominated by bending stiﬀness of indi - vidual ﬁlament . This conclusion is corroborated by the observation that almost all of the energy stored in the deformed network is accounted for by transverse defor - mation of the rods ( compare Fig . 1 ) . Another remarkable feature of this plateau regime is the strong dependence of the shear modulus on line density . We ﬁnd G ∼ ( ρ − ρ c ) µ ′ with a rather large exponent µ ′ ≈ 6 . 7 . From the above analysis it may seem as if the anomalous elasticity in the plateau regime and the homogeneous elasticity in the aﬃne regime are two separate phenomena , and one might wonder how one emerges from the other . To analyze this 4 relation we try a crossover scaling ansatz , G = ( ρ − ρ c ) µ ′ g [ α ( ρ − ρ c ) ν ′ ] = ξ ′− µ ′ / ν ′ ˜ g ( α / ξ ′ ) , ( 2 ) where we have deﬁned a new length scale ξ ′ ∼ ( ρ − ρ c ) − ν ′ . For this ansatz to reduce to the modulus expected in the aﬃne region , the scaling function g ( x ) needs to scale as g ( x ) ∼ x − 2 for x ≫ 1 and the exponents need to obey the scaling relation µ ′ = 2 ν ′ + 1 . In the plateau regime , g ( x ) is expected to be constant . As shown in Fig . 4 , we obtain an excellent scaling collapse for over almost eight orders of magnitude in the scaling variable x = α / ξ ′ us - ing ν ′ = 2 . 83 or equivalently µ ′ = 6 . 67 and the critical line density ρ c ≈ 5 . 71 , associated with connectivity per - colation . Additionally , the scaling function g ( x ) displays the expected behavior . Meeting both of these require - ments is highly nontrivial , and gives strong evidence for the anomalous scaling law in Eq . 2 . −4 −2 0 2 4 6 log 10 ( α δρ ν ) −12 −10 −8 −6 −4 −2 l og 10 g ρ = 15 ρ = 20 ρ = 30 ρ = 40 ρ = 60 ρ = 80 ρ = 100 ρ = 150 ν = 2 . 83 µ = 6 . 67 ρ c = 5 . 71 G = δρ µ g ( α δρ ν ) FIG . 4 : Scaling plot of the shear modulus for free hinges for a series of densities above ρ = 15 indicated in the graph ( same data as in Fig . 3 ) . Data collapse to the crossover scaling form , Eq . 2 , is obtained with ν ′ = 2 . 83 . Note that here and in all other ﬁgures the unit of length is ℓ and the unit of the shear modulus G is κ / ℓ 3 . The existence of such a broad scaling regime far from the percolation threshold is a surprising and intriguing feature of stiﬀ polymer networks . At the moment we are lacking a complete understanding of its physical ori - gin . In particular , the geometrical signiﬁcance of the new length scale ξ ′ remains unclear . One may speculate that the anomalous scaling behavior is a subtle conse - quence of the interplay between quenched randomness of the network structure and long - range correlation eﬀects induced by the stiﬀness of the ﬁlaments . An immediate consequence of the scaling form , Eq . 2 , is the existence of a crossover line density ρ cross scaling as ℓρ cross ∼ α − 1 / ν ′ , where we have re - introduced units of length ℓ . This im - plies that increasing ﬁlament length at constant line den - sity drives the system towards the aﬃne regime , in accord with Ref . [ 18 ] . While these results for an idealized two - dimensional model are certainly not straightforwardly applicable to three - dimensional cytoskeletal networks , one may still try to get an idea for the scales involved . We expect that network densities can be compared roughly by using the average distance ℓ c between intersections as a measure : A cytoskeletal network might have ℓ c ≈ 0 . 1 µ m with typical ﬁlament lengths of 2 µ m . These values correspond to a two - dimensional line density of ρ ≈ 20 and an aspect ratio of α ≈ 0 . 002 , which would place a typical actin network in the bending dominated intermediate regime . Understanding the full complexity of cytoskeletal net - works certainly merits further theoretical and experimen - tal work . Building on the knowledge gained from our idealized model , future investigations may among many other questions want to address three - dimensional sys - tems , polydispersity , thermal ﬂuctuations or even the ki - netics of the crosslinking molecules .
