Blood , Vol 73 , No 1 ( January ) , 1989 : pp 177 - 184 177 Heparin Binds to Human Monocytes and Modulates Their Procoagulant Activities and Secretory Phenotypes . Effect of Histidine - Rich Glycoprotein By Lawrence Leung , Katsuyasu Saigo , and Deborah Grant The binding of heparin to human monocytes and the monocytoid cell line U937 was characterized . Heparin binding was rapid . specific . saturable . and reversible . There was a single class of heparin binding sites . with an apparent dissociation constant of 0 . 19 Mmol / L and 1 . 9 x 1 0 sites per cell . The binding was not dependent on the anticoagulant property of heparin . Analysis of surface - iodinated cell lysates by heparin affinity chromatography revealed a major 120 Kd cell surface heparin - binding pro - tein . Histidine - rich glycoprotein . a potent heparin antago - nist found in human plasma and platelets . decreased the H EPARIN and heparin - like glycosaminoglycans play an important and complex role in blood vessel wall biolo - gy . Anticoagulantly active heparan sulfate on the endothelial cell surface is crucial in the maintenance of the nonthrom - bogenic property of blood vessels . ”2 Heparin augments the mitogenic potency of endothelial cell growth factor and is chemotactic for endothelial cells . 36 In contrast , both antico - agulantly active and inactive heparin inhibit the growth of smooth muscle cells and regulate a variety of smooth muscle cell activities , including cell migration , biosynthetic pheno - type , and the composition of the extracellular matrix . 3”4 In response to vascular injury , monocytes and macro - phages interact with the endothelium and play an active role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis , inflammation , and thrombosis . ’5’6 Heparin stimulates the production of a mononuclear cell factor by monocytes . ’7 However , the inter - action of heparin with human monocytes and its potential modulation and functional properties are not well defined . In this study , the specific binding of heparin to human mono - cytes and the monocytoid cell line U937 cells was character - ized . The binding was partially inhibited by histidine - rich glycoprotein ( HRGP ) , ’ a potent heparin antagonist found in human plasma and released from activated platelets . ’8(cid:1) # { 176 } Monocyte cell surface bound heparin was functionally active and heparin modulated the secretory phenotype of mono - cytes . affinity of heparin for cell binding . Cell surface bound heparin was functionally active and markedly accelerated the inactivation of thrombin by antithrombin Ill . Heparin induced the release of two monocyte secretory proteins of 160 and 1 7 Kd . Our study supports the thesis that heparin and related glycosaminoglycans interact with monocytes and macrophages , as well as endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells , and play an important and complex role in blood vessel wall biology . , 1989 by Grune & Stratton , Inc .

Mono - cytes and U937 cells ( 7 x 10’ cells / mL ) were incubated in 20 mmol / L phosphate buffered saline , pH 7 . 4 , containing 2 % bovine serum albumin ( PBS / BSA ) for one hour at 4 # { 176 } C . 35S - heparin , in the presence or absence of 50 - fold excess of unlabeled heparin , was added to cell aliquots and incubated for one hour at 4 # { 176 } C . The final volume of the reaction mixture was 300 (cid:1)L with a cell concentration of 3 . 6 ) ( 106 cells / mL . At the end of incubation , cell - bound heparin was separated from unbound heparin by centrifuging the cell suspensions through silicone oil ( 6 . 7 parts Dow Corning oil 550 , 3 . 3 parts Dow Corning oil 556 , 5G . 1 . 040 ) at 14 , 000 g for ten minutes in a Beckman microfuge . The cell pellets were solubilized with 0 . 2 N NaOH , added to Biofluor , and cell - bound radioactivity determined in a scintillation counter . Each experiment was repeated at least three times with each data point performed in duplicate . 35S - heparin binding to U937 cells in the presence of HRGP and to washed human RBCs were performed in an identical manner . Internalization of bound heparin by U937 cells . Aliquots of U937 cells were incubated separately in PBS / BSA buffer for one hour at 4 # { 176 } Cand 37 # { 176 } C . Binding of 35S - heparin ( final concentration , 5 i(cid:1)mol / L ) was carried out at the two temperatures for one to three hours . At the end of incubation , cell suspensions were washed with cold PBS / BSA and treated with trypsin ( 0 . 25 % ) for 30 minutes at 4 # { 176 } C . Cell - bound heparin , in the presence or absence of trypsin treatment , was determined . Trypsin treatment at this concentration did not cause any cell death as determined by trypan blue exclusion . Alternatively , instead of surface trypsinization , internalized heparin was determined by using 50 - fold excess of unlabeled heparin to displace surface - bound 35S - heparin . Fractionation of 35S - heparin by A TIll affinity chromatogra - phy . Nine milligrams of purified ATIII was coupled to 2 . 3 mL of CNBr - activated sepharose 4B . Aliquots of 35S - heparin were applied to the ATIII - sepharose column in PBS and eluted with 20 mmol / L phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 4 , containing 2 mol / L NaCI . 3”33 The column flow - through fractions ( low - affinity heparin ) and the eluted frac - tions ( high - affinity heparin ) were separately pooled , dialyzed , and concentrated . Heparin affinity chromatography ofsurface iodinated U937 cell lysates . U937 cells were surface iodinated using the immobilized lactoperoxidase bead method ( BioRad , Richmond , CA ) . The labeled cells were washed with phosphate buffer three times and solubilized by 15 mmol / L CHAPS with protease inhibitors at 4 # { 176 } Cfor one hour . After centrifugation to remove any insoluble materials , aliquots of the cell lysates were applied to a heparin - sepharose 6B column and , after extensive washings , eluted with I mol / L NaCI . The eluates were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and autoradiography . Inactivation of thrombin by heparin - pretreated U937 cells . U937 cells and control RBC were first incubated with RPMI / BSA at 4 # { 176 } Cfor one hour , then incubated with or without heparin ( final concentration , 0 . 24 (cid:1)mol / L ) at 4 # { 176 } Cfor one hour . Cells were washed once with PBS / BSA and fixed with glutaralde - hyde ( final concentration , 0 . 1 % ) for 20 minutes at room tempera - ture . After fixation , the cells were washed with PBS three times . Using heparin - sepharose beads , it was shown that glutaraldehyde fixation at this concentration did not affect the heparin enhancement effect on thrombin inactivation by ATIII . The fixed U937 cells and RBC , with or without heparin preincubation , were added in various concentrations to thrombin ( final concentration , 10 U / mL ) and ATIII ( final concentration , 10 iig / mL ) in 40 mmol / L Tris - HC1 , 0 . 15 mol / L NaC1 , pH 8 . 3 . (cid:1)’ After 30 seconds ofincubation , throm - bin substrate 52238 ( final concentration , 0 . 5 mmol / L ) was added . After another 30 seconds of incubation , acetic acid ( final concentra - tion , I 5 . 6 % ) was added to stop the reaction . Acetic acid did not cause any RBC lysis and did not interfere with the absorbance measure - ment . The reaction mixtures ( total volume 200 zL ) were centrifuged and the absorbance of the supernates read at 405 nm . Each experiment was repeated three times with each data point done in duplicate . Heparin - HRGP interaction . HRGP ( final concentration , 10 zg / mL ) was coated on microtitration wells as previously described . (cid:1) Unbound HRGP was removed by washing with Tris / Tween buffer ( 10 mmol / L Tris - HC1 , 0 . 15 mol / L NaCI , 0 . 05 % Tween 20 , pH 7 . 4 ) three times . 35S - heparin in Tris / Tween buffer containing 2 mmol / L CaCI2 or 2 mmol / L EDTA , in the presence or absence of 50 - fold excess of unlabeled heparin , was added and incubated for one hour at 37 # { 176 } C . After extensive washings with Tris / Tween buffer , the HRGP - bound heparin was solubilized with 0 . 2 N NaOH , added to Biofluor , and radioactivity determined . Alternatively , heparin - sepharose beads were incubated with Tris . saline / 2 % BSA , followed by ‘DI - HRGP in the same buffer containing 2 mmol / L CaCl2 or 2 mmol / L EDTA , for one hour at room temperature . The samples were placed into modified l - mL Eppendorf pipette tips fitted with filter plugs ( U - l I plug ; Porex Technologies , Fairburn , GA ) . Unbound proteins were separated by centrifugation for one minute at 2 , 500 rpm in a table - top centrifuge . Heparin beads retained on the filters were washed three times with Tris / Tween buffer and the amount of ‘25IHRGP bound counted . Metabolic labeling of monocytes . Isolated human peripheral blood monocytes were placed in tissue culture wells at 1 to 2 x 106 cells / mL . After two hours of incubation , the nonadherent cells were removed and the adherent cells cultured in heparin for various periods of time . For the last two hours of heparin incubation , the culture media was replaced by methionine - free RPMI with “S - methionine ( 40 (cid:1)zCi / mL ) and 0 . 4 % FCS . At the end of incubation , the culture media were removed and precipitated with 10 % trichloroacetic acid . The precipitates were dissolved in sample buffer and analyzed by SDS - PAGE and autoradiography . RESULTS Heparin binding to U937 cells and human mono - cytes . 35S - heparin bound to U937 cells in a concentration - dependent and saturable manner .

To determine if the bound heparin was internalized by U937 cells , binding of 33S - heparin was carried out at 4 # { 176 } Cand 37 # { 176 } C . Cells were then trypsinized and the residual amount of cell - bound heparin determined ( Table 1 ) . At 4 # { 176 } C , 10 % of the cell - bound heparin was not removed by surface trypsini - zation , consistent with the 10 % nonspecific binding as determined by excess unlabeled heparin , indicating that there was minimal cellular internalization of heparin at 4 # { 176 } C . When binding was performed at 37 # { 176 } C , 18 % and 28 % of the respective total cell - bound heparin at one hour and three hours of incubation was not removed by trypsin , demonstrat - ing internalization of heparin by U937 cells at 37 # { 176 } C . Alter - natively , when excess unlabeled heparin was added to dis - place 35S - heparin from the cell surface , a similar increase in the amount of nondisplaceable cell - bound heparin was observed at 37 # { 176 } Ccompared with 4 # { 176 } C ( data not shown ) . Binding of heparin fractions to U937 cells . To further characterize the heparin binding to U937 cells , 35S - heparin was separated into fractions with high or low affinity for ATIII by ATIII affinity chromatography . While the binding of the high - affinity heparin fraction was equivalent to the unfractionated heparin , there was also significant binding of the low - affinity heparin fraction to U937 cells , indicating that the binding was not dependent on the anticoagulant property of heparin ( Table 2 ) . Binding of the unfractionated 35S - heparin was also performed in the presence of 20 - fold excess of unlabeled heparin preparations with various mol wts and anticoagulant activities . A low mol wt heparin ( RD heparin , mol wt 5 , 127 , 98 USP U / mL ) was as effective as regular heparin in inhibiting 35S - heparin binding ( 94 % inhi - bition ) . A heparin fragment with minimal anticoagulant activity ( DH heparin , mol wt 2 , 750 , 7 USP U / mL ) also caused significant inhibition ( 73 % inhibition ) , consistent with the observation that heparin binding was not dependent on its anticoagulant property . Characterization of heparin - binding proteins on U937 cell surface . Detergent - solubilized cell surface iodinated U937 cell lysates were applied to a heparin - sepharose affin - ity column and analysis of the eluate revealed a major cell surface heparin - binding protein with mol wt 120 , 000 ( Fig 4 ) . When the cell lysates were applied in the presence of excess fluid phase heparin , the 120 Kd protein was not detected . Additional control using an albumin - sepharose column was also negative , demonstrating the specificity of this heparin - binding protein . The identity of the I 20 Kd cell surface protein was not determined . Modulation of heparin binding by HRGP .

Fixed U937 cells and control RBC ( 1 . 2 x 107 / mL ) were added to thrombin ( 10 U / mL ) , and ATIII ( 10 (cid:1)g / mL ) and after 30 seconds of incubation , thrombin substrate 52238 was added . After another 30 seconds of incubation , acetic acid was added to stop the reaction and absorbance ( A405 ) of the assay mixture read in a photometer .

Specific heparin binding to the HRGP - coated wells was plotted in this figure . ( B ) Effect of EDTA on HRGP modulation of heparin binding to U937 cells . (cid:1)S - heparin binding ( final concen - tration . 0 . 25 Mmol / L ) to U937 cells was carried out in the presence of 2 mmol / L CaCl2 or 2 mmol / L EDTA as described in Fig 1 . heparin , an increase of two secretory proteins , mol wt 160 , 000 and 17 , 000 , in the culture media was observed ( Fig 8 ) . The inductive effect of heparin was dose dependent and occurred quite rapidly ( after two hours ) with maximal induction observed after 12 to 14 hours . A low mol wt heparin with minimal anticoagulant activity ( DH heparin , 7 USP U / mL ) was also effective in the induction of these two secretory proteins , whereas dermatan sulfate was much less effective . Of note , the heparin inductive effect was not HEPARIN INTERACTIONS WITH HUMAN MONOCYTES 181 potent heparin - binding protein found in plasma and is released from activated platelets . ’8(cid:1) # { 176 } Whether HRGP would modulate heparin binding to U937 cells was examined . HRGP caused a concentration - dependent shift of the hepa - rin binding isotherm to the right , requiring a fourfold increase in heparin concentration to achieve 50 % binding in the presence of 100 zg / mL HRGP . The data suggest that HRGP significantly decreased the affinity of heparin for U937 cells ( Fig 5 ) . The inhibitory effect was not due to contamination of the HRGP samples by heparin during the preparative procedure since HRGP that had been further purified by anion - exchange ( Mono - Q ) chromatography had a similar effect on heparin cell binding . While the heparin interaction with HRGP was dependent on divalent cation and inhibited by EDTA ( Fig 6A ) as previously reported , ’9 EDTA did not abolish the HRGP inhibitory effect on heparin binding to U937 cells ( Fig 6B ) .

HRGP also partially inhibited heparin binding to PMA - stimulated cells ( data not shown ) . Inactivation of thrombin by heparin - pretreated U937 cells .

U937 cells not pretreated with heparin had no effect on ATIII inactiva - tion ofthrombin . However , pretreatment with heparin mark - edly accelerated the inactivation of thrombin by ATIII , indicating that the cell - bound heparin was anticoagulantly functional . Using labeled heparin , it was demonstrated that the enhancement effect was not due to the release of cell - bound heparin into the fluid phase . Control studies with human RBC pretreated with heparin did not show any enhancement effect . The enhancement of thrombin inactivation by heparin pretreated U937 cells correlated positively with the cell concentration , with 50 % enhancement occurring at 4 . 5 x I 06 cells / mL ( Fig 7B ) . An equivalent degree of thrombin macti - vation was obtained by 60 ng / mL of heparin in the fluid phase ( Fig 7A ) . Using labeled heparin , the amount of heparin fixed on the U937 cells was determined to be 15 ng / 106 cells or 67 . 5 ng / mL . The data indicated that the 0 5 10 15 20 anticoagulant potency of cell - bound heparin was nearly equivalent to that of fluid phase heparin . Effect ofheparin on monocyte secretory proteins .

Induction of monocyte secretory proteins by heparin . Adherent human peripheral blood monocytes were cultured in heparin for different incubation times . For the last two hours of incubation . the cells were metabolically labeled with (cid:1)S - methio - nine . At the end of incubation . the culture media were removed and precipitated with 10 % trichloroacetic acid . The precipitates were dissolved in sample buffer and analyzed by SDS - PAGE and autoradiography . Equal amounts of radioactive counts were applied in each lane . 182 LEUNG . SAIGO , AND GRANT Fig 7 . ( A ) Inactivation of thrombin by heparin . Increasing concentrations of heparin were added to thrombin ( 10 U / mI ) and ATIII ( 10 (cid:1)g / mL ) and residual thrombin activities determined as described in Table 2 . ( B ) Inactivation of thrombin by heparin - pretreated U937 cells . Heparin - pretreated U937 cells at 1 . 7 x 10 cells / mi was added at various dilutions to the thrombin and ATIII mixture and residual thrombin activities determined . observed in U937 cells . The identity of these monocyte secretory proteins remained to be determined . DISCUSSION In this study , binding of heparin to human monocytes and the monocytoid cell line U937 was characterized . The bind - ing was specific , time - and concentration - dependent , satura - ble , and reversible , suggesting a ligand - receptor type interac - tion on the cell surface ( Figs 1 through 3 ) . Since heparin is highly negatively charged , a strong ionic interaction between heparin and cell surface proteins with basic characteristics is anticipated , raising the possibility that heparin may bind to multiple cell surface proteins . However , Scatchard plot analysis of the binding data revealed a single class of heparin binding sites ( Fig 1 ) , and heparin affinity chromatography of the surface labeled cell lysates revealed a major 120 Kd heparin - binding protein ( Fig 4 ) . These findings demonstrate that heparin only bound to a limited number of specific cell surface proteins . Whether the 120 Kd heparin - binding pro - tein represents a heparin receptor on the monocyte cell surface remains to be determined . The number of heparin - binding sites on U937 cells ( 1 . 9 x 106 binding sites per cell ) is in the same range as that reported for human endothelial cells ( 1 x 106 sites per cell ) and rat liver cells ( 1 x l0(cid:1) sites per cell ) , 35’(cid:1) and higher than that found on smooth muscle cells ( 1 x i05 sites per cell ) . 37 Heparin binding to mouse peritoneal macrophages has also been described but the affinity of heparin binding and the number of binding sites were not reported . 38 More recently , heparin binding to human platelets is observed . 39’(cid:1) # { 176 } In view of the present findings , it will be of interest to characterize the cell - surface heparin - binding proteins from these various cell types and determine if they are structurally and functionally related . HRGP , a potent heparin antagonist found in human plasma and released from activated platelets , (cid:1) # { 176 } decreased the affinity of heparin for U937 cells ( Fig 5 ) . Significant modulation of heparin binding was observed with HRGP concentration at 50 to 100 jsg / mL , suggesting that plasma HRGP , at 100 to 150 (cid:1)ig / mL , 23’33 would have a similar effect . Recently , HRGP inhibition of the antiproliferative effect of heparin on arterial smooth muscle cells was reported . 4’ Taken together , the data suggest that the modulation of heparin binding to cells by HRGP may represent a major function for this protein in vivo . The mechanism whereby HRGP modulates heparin bind - ing to the monocyte cell surface is not fully defined . The observation that HRGP decreased the affinity of heparin binding suggests that the HRGP - binding site is different from the cell - binding site on the heparin molecule . It should be noted that while EDTA abolished the direct HRGP - heparin interaction as previously reported , 35 it had no effect on the HRGP inhibition of heparin cell binding ( Fig 6 ) . The data suggest that , in addition to competition for heparin binding in the fluid phase , HRGP may interact directly with the cell surface and thereby alter its affinity for heparin . Recently , we obtained data demonstrating direct binding of HRGP to U937 cells ( K . Saigo , L . Leung , unpublished observation , July 1987 ) . Cell surface bound heparin was functionally active , and markedly accelerated the inactivation of thrombin by ATIII ( Table 3 ) . The anticoagulant potency of the cell - bound heparin was equivalent to that of fluid phase heparin ( Fig 7 ) . Human monocytes and macrophages generate potent tissue - factor activity on stimulation and provide an optimal cell surface for the efficient assembly of prothrombinase , the major enzyme complex that catalyzes thrombin generation For personal use only . on November 10 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From REFERENCES HEPARIN INTERACTIONS WITH HUMAN MONOCYTES 183 in vivo . 42(cid:1) Fibrin deposition is a prominent feature of inflammation and fibrin has been identified on macrophage cell surface . 4(cid:1)7 The specific binding and localization of functionally active heparin to the same cells may represent a pathway to modulate the procoagulant properties of mono - cytes and macrophages at sites of inflammation and throm - bosis . The functional consequence of heparin binding to mono - cytes is not limited to its anticoagulant property . Significant binding of heparin fractions with low affinity for AT ! ! ! to U937 cells was demonstrated ( Table 2 ) .
