We reviewed 47 studies on architectural design , engineeringdesignandproductdesignengineering . Thispaperreports24cognitive processes investigated in a subset of 33 studies aligning with two viewpoints on the nature of designing : ( V1 ) design as search ( 10 processes , 41 . 7 % ) ; and ( V2 ) design as exploration ( 14 processes , 58 . 3 % ) . Studies on search focused on solution search and problem structuring , involving : long - term memory retrieval ; working memory ; operators and reasoning processes . Studies on exploration investigated : co - evolutionary design ; visual reasoning ; cognitive actions ; and unexpected discovery and situated requirements invention . Overall , considerable conceptual and terminological diﬀerences were observed among the studies . Nonetheless , a common focus on memory , semantic , associative , visual perceptual and mental imagery processes was observed to an extent . We suggest three challenges for future research to advance the field : ( i ) developing general models / theories ; ( ii ) testing protocol study findings using objective methods conducive to larger samples and ( iii ) developing a shared ontology of cognitive processes in design . Key words : design cognition , conceptual design , protocol analysis , cognitive processes , psychology 1 . Introduction In his work on the principles of engineering design , Hubka ( 1982 , p . 3 ) notes that designing ‘is a very personal activity , and can probably only be performed by one person as an internal and somewhat subjective process’ . The nature of design as an internal cognitive activity has been a focus of design research for a number of decades , with Cross ( 2001 , p . 79 ) citing studies by Charles Eastman in the late 1960s as the starting point for much of the enquiry in this area . Since then , there has been a proliferation of empirical studies on design cognition ( Dinar et al . 2015 ) . That is , the cognitive processes and information used by designers whilst designing ( Visser 2004 ) . Dinar et al . ( 2015 ) reviewed empirical design cognition 1 / 36 https : / / www . cambridge . org / core / terms . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1017 / dsj . 2017 . 11 Downloaded from https : / / www . cambridge . org / core . University of Strathclyde , on 21 Jul 2017 at 09 : 58 : 05 , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use , available at studies published over the past 25 years , noting that the majority have focused on the early , relatively ambiguous stages of the design process known as conceptual design ( McNeill , Gero & Warren 1998 ; Suwa , Gero & Purcell 2000 ; Goel 2014 ) . However , in spite of the considerable body of empirical work , several authors highlight that the nature of the cognitive processes involved in conceptual design remains unclear ( e . g . Dorst & Cross 2001 ; Jin & Benami 2010 ; Kim & Ryu 2014 ) . The systematic literature review is a commonly applied research method in scientific fields . It involves gathering and synthesising all publications on a particular phenomenon that meet prespecified inclusion criteria , ensuring coverage of all relevant evidence and minimising bias . Systematic reviews conducted in accordance with established guidelines ( e . g . the PRISMA statement ( Moher et al . 2009 ) ) are rigorous , transparent and reproducible , and therefore held to the same standard as empirical research . A systematic review of empirical design cognition studies could clarify the cognitive processes involved in conceptual design , revealing common findings as well as diﬀerences in perspectives . However , there has thus far been only a single systematic review in this area ( Jiang & Yen 2009 ) , focusing largely on methodological aspects of protocol analysis . Other authors provide extensive and informative reviews of the area ( Cross 2001 ; Coley , Houseman & Roy 2007 ; Dinar et al . 2015 ) , but these are not systematic and go beyond protocol studies to look at other approaches . This paper reports findings from the first systematic review of protocol studies focusing specifically on conceptual design cognition , aiming to answer the following research question : What is our current understanding of the cognitive processes involved in conceptual design tasks carried out by individual designers ? Protocol analysis involves interpreting subjective verbal reports of a designer’s cognitive processing provided during or after completion of a design task ( Ericsson & Simon 1984 ; van Someren , Barnard & Sandberg 1994 ; Gero & Tang 2001 ) , along with other aspects such as sketches and motor actions ( Suwa , Purcell & Gero 1998 a ; Park & Kim 2007 ) . Whilst the merits of protocol analysis are widely debated ( Lloyd , Lawson & Scott 1995 ; Suwa & Tversky 1997 ; Sarkar & Chakrabarti 2014 ) , several authors suggest that it is one of the only methods capable of directly revealing the internal processing of designers ( van Someren et al . 1994 ; Lloyd et al . 1995 ; Cross 2001 ; Sarkar & Chakrabarti 2014 ) . We reviewed and synthesised 47 protocol studies spanning architectural design , engineering design and product design engineering , leading to the identification of 35 distinct cognitive processes . Owing to space limitations , this paper reports a subset of 24 processes investigated in 33 articles , namely those aligning with two viewpoints on the nature of designing discussed in the broader literature ( e . g . Logan & Smithers 1993 ; Maher & Tang 2003 ; Sim & Duﬀy 2003 ) : ( V1 ) design as search ( 10 processes , 41 . 7 % ) , where designing is viewed as a search process transforming knowledge states in a problem space ; and ( V2 ) design as exploration ( 14 processes , 58 . 3 % ) , where designing is viewed as an exploratory process operating between problem and solution spaces . Our review forms part of a broader eﬀort to provide a more unified view of the field , and the remaining cognitive processes will be reported in a future paper on this theme . Methods and sample characteristics are outlined in Section 2 , before the review findings are explored in depth in Sections 3 and 4 . A discussion is provided in Section 5 , and the paper concludes with a brief summary in Section 6 . 2 / 36 https : / / www . cambridge . org / core / terms . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1017 / dsj . 2017 . 11 Downloaded from https : / / www . cambridge . org / core .

Methods and sample Our approach was informed by the PRISMA statement , consisting of a generic four - phase flow diagram and checklist providing formal guidance on conducting and reporting systematic reviews ( Moher et al . 2009 ) . Figure 1 presents a flow diagram for our review specifically . We undertook four of the recommended review phases : ( i ) identification of candidate articles ; ( ii ) screening the abstracts of candidates for relevance ; ( iii ) defining inclusion criteria for the review , and using these to assess the eligibility of relevant full - text articles and ( iv ) qualitatively synthesising the final sample of eligible articles . We consulted the checklist to guide our reporting of the review findings , although we found several elements to be irrelevant . In particular , Moher et al . ( 2009 , p . 1 ) note that whilst the checklist covers items relating to both qualitative synthesis and statistical meta - analysis of reviewed articles , statistical methods ‘may or may not be used to analyze and summarize the results of the included studies’ . Meta - analysis was not appropriate for this work owing to the qualitative nature of the findings reviewed ( types of cognitive process ) , and thus we employed qualitative synthesis alone . The review centred on conceptual design tasks carried out by individual designers ; group - based tasks were excluded . To enable comparison and synthesis of cognitive processes from diﬀerent studies , we reviewed work from three domains similar in terms of their approach to design problems and their fundamental focus on function ( i . e . the purpose of an artefact ( Gero & Kannengiesser 2004 ) , as opposed to cognitive function ( Chan et al . 2008 ) ) , behaviour and structure ( Hubka 1982 ; Gero 1990 ; Roozenburg & Eekels 1994 ) : architectural design ( e . g . Goldschmidt 1991 ) ; engineering design ( e . g . Lloyd & Scott 1994 ) and product design engineering ( e . g . Dorst & Cross 2001 ) . We consider the latter to include tasks incorporating industrial design requirements ( e . g . aesthetics , usability and ergonomics ) as well as technical requirements . Two design researchers with expertise in product design engineering ( RDes1 and RDes2 ) selected and reviewed articles , receiving regular input from a cognitive neuroscience researcher ( RCog ) . The article selection process , sample characteristics and qualitative synthesis approach are elaborated below . 2 . 1 . Article selection process Literature was gathered between 27th March 2015 and 3rd April 2015 . Major engineering / design and psychology databases were searched ( Compendex , Design and Applied Arts Index , Technology Research Database , Embase , PsycINFO and PubMed ) , in addition to general scientific databases ( Science Direct and Web of Science ) . As Table 1 shows , we structured our search terms into four groups reflecting the various aspects of our research question . Search terms were generally applied across the title and abstract fields , and searches were conducted across the broadest date range permitted by each database . Where possible , searches were limited to English results only . A total of 6796 articles were obtained ( Figure 1 ) . As Figure 1 conveys , following de - duplication of search results we arrived at 4996 articles reporting a variety of study types , including controlled performance tests , protocol studies , literature reviews , surveys and case studies . As discussed in Section 1 , we sought to answer our research question by identifying cognitive processes from empirical studies . Given the general view that protocol analysis 3 / 36 https : / / www . cambridge . org / core / terms . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1017 / dsj . 2017 . 11 Downloaded from https : / / www . cambridge . org / core .

Flow diagram of systematic review process ( based on generic diagram in Moher et al . ( 2009 ) ) . is the most capable method for revealing such processes , we decided to focus the review on protocol studies alone . To maximise coverage , we ran follow - up searches ( 9th October 2015 ) through the same databases searched initially using terms reflective of protocol analysis ( e . g . protocol study , think aloud and verbalisation ) . During eligibility assessment ( Figure 1 ) , we evaluated full - text articles against six inclusion criteria presented in Table 2 .

Suwa & Tversky 1996 ; Suwa , Gero & Purcell 1998 b ; Suwa et al . 2001 ) . We conducted reference list searches on included articles and assessed identified candidates against the same eligibility criteria . 2 . 2 . Sample characteristics In total , 47 articles were included in the sample . Given the focus on a subset of the review findings , only 33 are discussed in depth in this paper ( denoted by * in the reference list ) . However , the full sample may be downloaded as supplementary material , and we report key characteristics of the sample in its entirety here ( visualised in Figure 2 ) . Articles date from 1979 ( Akin 1979 ) to 2015 ( e . g . Yu & Gero 2015 ) , with 24 ( 53 . 2 % ) published in the last decade . The sample includes : ( i ) full protocol studies , where data was gathered , analysed and reported in a single study ( 36 , 76 . 6 % ) ; and ( ii ) analyses , where previously gathered data was analysed and reported ( 11 , 23 . 4 % ) . Approximately 350 participants were involved , ranging from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 36 per study ( mean = 7 , 5 / 36 https : / / www . cambridge . org / core / terms . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1017 / dsj . 2017 . 11 Downloaded from https : / / www . cambridge . org / core . University of Strathclyde , on 21 Jul 2017 at 09 : 58 : 05 , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use , available at Figure 2 . Key statistics for study characteristics . median = 6 , standard deviation = 6 . 30 ) . As Figure 2 shows , a sample size between 1 and 16 participants was most common . Broadly speaking , participants included undergraduate , Master’s and PhD students , as well as practicing designers and architects . Participants’ experience levels ranged from 0 to 38 years , although inconsistent definitions of ‘experience’ were observed . In addition , several authors did not provide information on participants’ experience ( e . g . Chen & Zhao 2006 ; Chandrasekera , Vo & D’Souza 2013 ) . We identified 45 distinct design tasks – 20 ( 44 . 4 % ) architectural design , 19 ( 42 . 2 % ) product design engineering and 6 ( 13 . 3 % ) engineering design . In certain cases , the same task was studied by multiple authors ( e . g . Suwa & Tversky 1997 ; Suwa et al . 1998 a , 2000 ; Suwa 2003 ) . The following types of verbalisations were analysed : ( i ) concurrent ( 32 studies , 68 . 1 % ) ; ( ii ) retrospective ( 11 studies , 23 . 4 % ) or ( iii ) a combination of concurrent and retrospective ( 4 studies , 8 . 5 % ) . Verbal protocols ranged from 15 minutes to 600 minutes . Six authors omitted length ( Kavakli & Gero 2001 ; Chiu 2003 ; Maher & Tang 2003 ; Chen & Zhao 2006 ; Maher & Kim 2006 ) and in one study , the task was self - paced ( Sun , Yao & Carretero 2013 ) . Video of external behaviour during the task was additionally recorded in 38 studies ( 84 . 4 % ) , and sketches were gathered in 24 studies ( 51 . 1 % ) . 2 . 3 . Qualitative synthesis Cognitive processes and viewpoints emerged from the sample and were formalised through an iterative process of interpretation and refinement . Throughout , cognitive processes were identified on the basis of a definition oﬀered by Poldrack et al . ( 2011 , p . 3 ) in the cognitive neuroscience literature : cognitive processes are ‘entities that transform or operate on mental representations’ . Mental representations are defined as ‘mental entities that stand in relation to some physical entity [ . . . ] or abstract concept ( which could be another mental entity ) ’ . 6 / 36 https : / / www . cambridge . org / core / terms . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1017 / dsj . 2017 . 11 Downloaded from https : / / www . cambridge . org / core . University of Strathclyde , on 21 Jul 2017 at 09 : 58 : 05 , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use , available at An example of a mental representation is a mental image of a visual scene , and a corresponding example of a cognitive process is ‘a process that searches a mental representation of the visual scene for a particular object’ . Articles were initially split between RDes1 and RDes2 , who read the full text and identified types of processes studied across the sample ( e . g . memory , semantic processes , perception , mental imagery and higher - order reasoning processes ) . These were discussed with RCog and continually refined . As the categories emerged , RDes1 and RDes2 recorded specific descriptions of cognitive processes pertaining to each in a common synthesis matrix . Several descriptions subsumed multiple process types ( discussed in Section 5 ) . Finally , RDes1 analysed the synthesis matrix to identify commonalities in the descriptions provided by diﬀerent authors ( e . g . similarities in descriptive terms and the nature of the representations related to processes ) , and abstracted more general descriptions where appropriate . The final list of processes was reviewed by all team members . During the above process , both RDes1 and RDes2 observed persistent diﬀerences in the terminology and concepts applied to describe cognition in diﬀerent studies . These were interpreted as reflecting two viewpoints ( V ) on the nature of designing : ( V1 ) search , where designing is seen as a largely linear sequence of operators eﬀecting changes to design knowledge states ; and ( V2 ) exploration , where designing is viewed as an iterative and situated process of interpreting the problem , proposing solutions and restructuring the problem and / or solution in response to features perceived in each ( Newell & Simon 1972 ; Logan & Smithers 1993 ; Maher & Tang 2003 ; Sim & Duﬀy 2003 ; Visser 2006 ) . In addition , numerous authors were found to discuss cognition more generally in relation to design activities ( V3 ) . Examples of design activities identifiable in the sample include problem analysis ( Jin & Benami 2010 ) , concept generation ( Jin & Chusilp 2006 ) , synthesis ( McNeill et al . 1998 ) , concept evaluation ( Jin & Chusilp 2006 ) and decision making ( Kim & Ryu 2014 ) . To provide a coherent framework for reporting the review findings , RDes1 assigned each of the articles to one of the above three viewpoints . Articles were searched for relevant keywords , e . g . : ( V1 ) search , problem structuring , state transformation and operator ; ( V2 ) exploration , perception and situatedness and ( V3 ) activities , concept evaluation and concept generation . Each article was interpreted by RDes1 and classified as pertaining primarily to V1 , V2 or V3 based on the usage of associated keywords by the authors . For example , articles explicitly aiming to characterise search / problem structuring processes and evidence operators using protocol data , but making contextual references to keywords associated with design activities , were assigned to V1 ( e . g . Stauﬀer & Ullman 1991 ; Goel 1995 ; Liikkanen & Perttula 2009 ) . Articles focusing primarily on the conceptualisation and study of exploratory processes while making brief references to search keywords in background and discussion sections were assigned to V2 ( e . g . Dorst & Cross 2001 ; Maher & Tang 2003 ) . Note that whilst this activity was largely based on the judgement of RDes1 , the resulting classification was reviewed by all team members and refined where necessary . In total , 35 distinct cognitive processes were identified from articles on search ( 10 ) , exploration ( 14 ) and design activities ( 13 ) , with 2 processes overlapping search and activities , hence 35 . This paper reports the 24 processes investigated in studies on design as search ( Section 3 ) and exploration ( Section 4 ) , with design 7 / 36 https : / / www . cambridge . org / core / terms . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1017 / dsj . 2017 . 11 Downloaded from https : / / www . cambridge . org / core . University of Strathclyde , on 21 Jul 2017 at 09 : 58 : 05 , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use , available at activities covered in a future paper . The processes are presented in Table 8 in Appendix A , where each is assigned a code identifier consisting of a viewpoint ( V ) and process ( P ) number , e . g . V 1 P1 . We adopted the organisation and structure conveyed in Table 8 largely because it aligns with the manner in which processes are discussed by the authors investigating them . In turn , we found it to be the most conducive to clear explanation of the review findings . However , we acknowledge that other researchers may have diﬀerent interpretations . In this respect , the review raises important ontological questions about how cognitive processes should be defined and organised for study in design research ( Section 5 . 2 ) . 3 . Design as search As discussed in Section 2 , designing may be viewed as both a linear search process ( V1 ) and an iterative exploratory process ( V2 ) . This section presents the 10 cognitive processes we identified from studies aligning with V1 , which are summarised in Table 8 in Appendix A . For reference purposes , the code identifying each process in Table 8 is appended in superscript to the first mention of each process throughout Sections 3 and 4 . 3 . 1 . Memory , operators , solution search and reasoning Studies on design as search tend to view the designer as an information processing system ( Chan 1990 ; Stauﬀer & Ullman 1991 ; Dorst & Dijkhuis 1995 ) , where elementary processes called operators V 1 P 1 are enacted to transform information from input to output states ( Stauﬀer & Ullman 1991 ) ; that is , to eﬀect state transformations ( Akin 1979 ; Goel 1995 ) . The range of operators identified from our sample is summarised in Table 2 ; a detailed elaboration would contravene article space limitations . Note that instances are presented as stated by authors and have not been abstracted , hence similarities may be observed in certain cases ( e . g . create and generate , no decision and suspend , etc . ) . Nonetheless , they may be broadly grouped into four categories reflecting various design activities : information gathering ; comprehending , representing and structuring information ; generating and synthesising ; and evaluating and decision making . Several authors were found to provide evidence supporting high - level operator execution patterns for search and process management , termed search methods ( Stauﬀer & Ullman 1991 ) and control strategies ( Chan 1990 ) , respectively ( e . g . Chan 1990 ; Stauﬀer & Ullman 1991 ; Goel 1995 ; Kim et al . 2007 ) . These are also briefly summarised in Table 3 . Chan ( 1990 ) suggests that during designing , a designer firstly retrieves a schema relevant to the design problem from long - term memory V 1 P 2 . Schemas may be viewed as abstract knowledge structures , containing both declarative knowledge about design problems and procedural knowledge in the form of operators ( Ball , Ormerod & Morley 2004 ) . For instance , Akin ( 1979 ) suggests that schemas comprise an input state ( declarative knowledge ) , an output state ( declarative knowledge ) and the set of operators required to convert the input state to the output state ( procedural knowledge ) . Following schema retrieval , operators are extracted and activated in working memory V 1 P 3 , which supports the maintenance and manipulation of information ( Chan 1990 ; Stauﬀer & Ullman 1991 ) . In addition to information retrieved from long - term memory , certain operators serve to gather information from external sources ( see Table 3 ) .

These interactions may involve an external memory system – that is , resources such as sketches and notepads where ideas and thoughts may be recorded and stored externally , as well as information sources such as textbooks , databases , etc .

University of Strathclyde , on 21 Jul 2017 at 09 : 58 : 05 , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use , available at Figure 3 . The process of solution search . Collectively , the above processes may be described as ‘a search through [ . . . ] knowledge states guided by information accumulated during the search’ ( Chan 1990 , p . 64 ) . That is , the process of solution search V 1 P 4 , which is considered to be delimited by a problem space . Conceptually , the problem space constitutes ‘a representation of [ a designer’s ] task environment’ ( Newell & Simon 1972 , p . 59 ) , incorporating knowledge of an initial problem state , a goal state and all possible intermediate design states ( Newell & Simon 1972 ; Chan 1990 ; Stauﬀer & Ullman 1991 ; Goel 1995 ) . Solution search may be represented within this space as shown in Figure 3 , i . e . a series of state transformations originating in the problem state and culminating in the goal state ( Chan 1990 ; Stauﬀer & Ullman 1991 ) . Desired states to be attained during the search are specified in design goals ( Akin 1979 ; Chan 1990 ; Stauﬀer & Ullman 1991 ) . As Figure 3 illustrates , implementing constraints reduces the extent of the space to be searched ( Chan 1990 ; Goel 1995 ) , which is potentially large owing to the ill - defined and / or unstructured nature of design problems ( Chan 1990 ) . Goel ( 1995 , p . 119 ) , proposes that solution search may be more fully described in terms of ( i ) lateral and ( ii ) vertical transformations ( Figure 4 ) . Lateral transformations involve ‘movement from one idea to a slightly diﬀerent idea’ , and vertical transformations ‘movement from one idea to a more detailed version of the same idea’ . Goel ( 1995 , p . 126 ) identified supporting evidence for both in a practicing architect’s protocol . Lateral transformations are argued to be ‘necessary 11 / 36 https : / / www . cambridge . org / core / terms . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1017 / dsj . 2017 . 11 Downloaded from https : / / www . cambridge . org / core .

Lateral and vertical transformations within a problem space . for widening the problem space’ , whilst vertical transformations ‘deepen the problem space’ as Figure 4 illustrates . More recently , Chen & Zhao ( 2006 , p . 258 ) characterised the ‘cognition mode’ of automobile designers in terms of lateral and vertical transformations . Eckersley ( 1988 ) and Lloyd & Scott ( 1994 ) additionally highlight the role of deductive and inductive inference V 1 P 5 in a search context , i . e . the process by which logical judgements are made based on pre - existing information rather than direct observations . More specifically , several authors consider the role of a type of induction known as analogical reasoning V 1 P 6 , referring to the use of information about known semantic concepts to understand newly presented concepts ( Ball et al . 2004 ; Liikkanen & Perttula 2009 ) . Ball et al . ( 2004 , pp . 495 – 507 ) found that this may occur spontaneously during designing via ‘the recognition - primed application’ of knowledge schema retrieved from long - term memory . However , problems ‘resistant to schema - based processing’ may instead be solved via a conscious process of mapping solutions to previous problems onto the current problem . The latter may be viewed as a form of case - based reasoning V 1 P 7 , where new problems are solved on the basis of solutions to similar past problems ( Chiu 2003 ; Ball et al . 2004 ) . 12 / 36 https : / / www . cambridge . org / core / terms . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1017 / dsj . 2017 . 11 Downloaded from https : / / www . cambridge . org / core . University of Strathclyde , on 21 Jul 2017 at 09 : 58 : 05 , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use , available at 3 . 2 . Problem structuring Akin ( 1979 , p . 204 ) examined operator usage by a professional architect and concluded that prior to solution search , designers may employ a diﬀerent set of operators to develop ‘an internally assimilated representation of the problem context’ . This process is frequently termed problem structuring V 1 P 8 . Goel ( 1995 , p . 114 ) observed that whilst ‘problem structuring occurs at the beginning of the task , where one would expect it’ , it ‘may also recur periodically as needed’ . Similarly , Chan ( 1990 , p . 69 ) found that problem restructuring may be triggered by a ‘critical problem situation’ during solution search , e . g . a decision to abandon a particular solution . Problem restructuring results in changes to the solution path or problem structure , i . e . ‘the format of knowledge representation , goal plan and constraint establishment’ . With respect to goal plan formation , Lloyd & Scott ( 1994 ) , Liikkanen & Perttula ( 2009 ) and Lee , Gu & Williams ( 2014 ) study problem decomposition V 1 P 9 , i . e . the process of breaking a design problem down into sub - problems by specifying sub - goals ( Liikkanen & Perttula 2009 ) . The process of problem reframing V 1 P 10 investigated by Akin & Akin ( 1996 ) in the context of sudden mental insight ( SMI ) may be considered to relate to problem structuring , although it pertains to the specification of problem frames as opposed to goals , constraints , and requirements . SMI refers to ‘the moment where the designer gets an insight into the design solution and / or the problem frame’ ( Chandrasekera et al . 2013 , p . 195 ) , or what may colloquially be termed the ‘aha ! response’ ( Akin & Akin 1996 , p . 344 ) . Akin & Akin ( 1996 ) argue that to invoke SMI , designers must first recognise restrictive frames of reference and then specify new frames conducive to solving the problem . They propose that suitable frames of reference are determined using declarative and procedural domain knowledge retrieved from memory . 4 . Design as exploration In addition to the 10 cognitive processes discussed in Section 3 , we identified 14 processes from studies aligning with the viewpoint that design constitutes an iterative exploratory process ( V2 ) . These are summarised in Table 8 in Appendix A and discussed in the following sub - sections . 4 . 1 . Co - evolutionary design A key characteristic of problem spaces in design as search is that the nature of the problem to be addressed , i . e . the search focus , does not change significantly over time ( Dorst & Cross 2001 ; Maher & Tang 2003 ) . An alternative perspective on design problems views them as evolutionary , i . e . subject to reinterpretation and reformulation over time as a solution emerges ( Maher & Tang 2003 ; Yu et al . 2014 ) . This is formalised in the co - evolution model of design , where the designer’s task environment is represented as two knowledge spaces ( Figure 5 ) : ( i ) the problem space , incorporating problem requirements and forming a basis for solution evaluation and ( ii ) the solution space , encompassing design solutions and providing a foundation for evaluating requirements ( Maher & Tang 2003 ) . Design is described as a co - evolutionary process V 2 P 1 , i . e . one that ‘explores the spaces of problem requirements and design solutions iteratively’ resulting in parallel evolution of design problems and solutions ( Maher & Tang 2003 , p . 48 ) .

The co - evolution model was originally proposed in computational form by Maher et al . ( 1996 ) and studied as a cognitive model by Dorst & Cross ( 2001 ) , Maher & Tang ( 2003 ) , Maher & Kim ( 2006 ) and Yu et al . ( 2014 ) . 4 . 2 . Sketch - based design exploration In studies on sketch - based exploratory design , problem / solution interactions may be understood in terms of situatedness : the notion that what a designer draws and perceives in their sketches aﬀects their interpretation of the problem and vice versa ( Suwa et al . 1998 a ; Reber 2011 ; Yu , Gu & Lee 2013 ) . A prolific model of situated designing is the situated FBS framework ( Gero & Kannengiesser 2004 ) , applied to code protocols by authors in the sample ( e . g . Yu et al . 2013 ) . The following sub - sections discuss 13 cognitive processes we identified from sketching studies , along with findings from several studies on the purpose of conceptual design sketching . 4 . 2 . 1 . Visual reasoning Visual reasoning V 2 P 2 may be broadly defined as the process of generating and reasoning about ideas whilst engaged in sketching . It is conceptualised in two ways by diﬀerent authors in the sample ( Goldschmidt 1991 ; Park & Kim 2007 ) . Firstly , Goldschmidt ( 1991 ) describes the process as a ‘dialectical’ reasoning pattern continually shifting between two modes : • Seeing as V 2 P 3 ( SA ) , i . e . the process of proposing attributes and properties for a design based on analogies between sketch elements and mental representations ( e . g . semantic concepts and past experiences ) . Suwa et al . ( 1998 a ) study a similar process called re - interpretation V 2 P 4 : assigning new functions to parts of a design through interpreting visuo - spatial elements and relations . Reinterpretation is classed as a type of functional cognitive action V 2 P 11 , discussed in Section 4 . 2 . 2 . 14 / 36 https : / / www . cambridge . org / core / terms . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1017 / dsj . 2017 . 11 Downloaded from https : / / www . cambridge . org / core . University of Strathclyde , on 21 Jul 2017 at 09 : 58 : 05 , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use , available at Figure 6 . Example of Goldschmidt’s ( 1991 ) dialectical visual reasoning pattern . • Seeing that V 2 P 3 ( ST ) , i . e . the process of rationalising design decisions relating to proposals developed through SA . Goldschmidt ( 1991 , p . 125 ) characterised design moves ( acts of design reasoning ) performed by eight practicing architects during a sketching task as involving either ST or SA . Characterisation was based on arguments , or ‘rational utterance [ s ] ’ considered to reveal reasoning modes . Participants were indeed observed to alternate between ST and SA throughout the task ( Figure 6 ) . Design moves were either ( i ) unimodal , i . e . characterised by one mode , or ( ii ) multimodal , i . e . characterised by two modes . Modal changes were observed in both directions , i . e . from ST to SA and vice versa . Goldschmidt ( 1991 , p . 140 ) argues that this dialectical pattern of reasoning is ‘rather unique’ to sketching activities . Whilst ST and SA may be observed in designers working without sketching or focusing on abstract visual displays , ‘they are not organised in the dialectical pattern’ illustrated in Figure 6 . Regarding the impact of diﬀerent sketching tools in this respect , Won ( 2001 ) observed a dialectical pattern in the visual reasoning of designers carrying out both freehand and computer - aided sketching tasks , with the latter involving more frequent shifts between ST and SA . More recently , Park & Kim ( 2007 ) proposed a visual reasoning model ( Figure 7 ) that formalises three interacting sub - processes termed seeing V 2 P 5 , imagining V 2 P 6 and drawing V 2 P 7 : • Seeing involves perceiving , analysing and interpreting visual information from external representations , resulting in the merging of ‘empirical knowledge’ ( e . g . test information ) with ‘visual knowledge’ from long - term memory ( Park & Kim 2007 , p . 4 ) . • Imagining involves generating new internal images , which may be transformed according to schemas in long - term memory and maintained for externalisation ( see below ) . Images may be generated using perceptual information produced by the process of seeing , and / or schemas . • Drawing involves evaluating and confirming internal representations , and externalising such representations ( e . g . through sketching ) . Protocols gathered from an expert and a student designer were considered to provide evidence for all three of the above processes and their interactive 15 / 36 https : / / www . cambridge . org / core / terms . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1017 / dsj . 2017 . 11 Downloaded from https : / / www . cambridge . org / core .

Copyright ( 2007 ) , The Design Society ; reprinted with permission . nature . Park & Kim ( 2007 , p . 10 ) claim the greatest interaction corresponded with the moment at which the ‘creative idea’ was generated , and in turn conclude that process interaction in visual reasoning leads to the emergence of creativity . However , it seems neither participant nor output creativity was assessed during the study . 4 . 2 . 2 . Cognitive actions During visual reasoning , designers think of and perceive various kinds of information in their sketches . Suwa & Tversky ( 1997 , p . 388 ) propose four information categories : ( i ) emergent properties , e . g . spaces , things , shapes / angles and sizes ; ( ii ) spatial relations , e . g . local and global relations ; ( iii ) functional relations , e . g . practical roles , abstract features and views and ( iv ) background knowledge . Whilst the authors acknowledge interdependencies between these categories , they are not elaborated . However , Suwa et al . ( 1998 a , pp . 458 – 459 ) argue that understanding these relationships is ‘key to understanding the ways in which designers cognitively interact with their own sketches’ . Building on the above categories , they propose a set of cognitive actions V 2 P 8 – that is , 16 / 36 https : / / www . cambridge . org / core / terms . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1017 / dsj . 2017 . 11 Downloaded from https : / / www . cambridge . org / core . University of Strathclyde , on 21 Jul 2017 at 09 : 58 : 05 , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use , available at interdependent cognitive processes argued to be involved in sketching . These are organised into four categories depending on the type of information they relate to ( Table 4 ) : ( i ) physical V 2 P 9 actions ( sensory information ) ; ( ii ) perceptual V 2 P 10 actions ( perceptual information , specifically visual ) ; and ( iii ) functional V 2 P 11 and ( iv ) conceptual V 2 P 12 actions ( semantic information ) . The categories were developed from the perspective that ‘information coming into human cognitive processes is processed first sensorily , then perceptually and semantically’ . Suwa et al . ( 1998 a , p . 458 ) claim the proposed actions are supported by ‘an enormous amount of concrete examples’ identified from an architect’s protocol . However , it is worth highlighting that the meaning of ‘cognitive action’ from a cognitive psychology perspective is somewhat ambiguous . The term is not clearly defined by Suwa et al . ( 1998 a , p . 455 ) , who appear to use it interchangeably with the ( also undefined ) phrase ‘design action’ . They also argue that a designer’s ‘cognitive behaviours’ may be represented as a set of interrelated cognitive actions . These phrases are problematic for psychologists , who typically refer to internal mental processes as ‘cognitive’ and view ‘action’ and ‘behaviour’ as external phenomena . Suwa et al . ( 1998 a , p . 472 ) further suggest that cognitive actions may be used for ‘dissecting the structures of a designer’s cognitive processes’ , suggesting they constitute interdependent cognitive processes . We adopt this interpretation ; however , it may be seen in Table 4 that the nature of the actions as either ‘cognitive’ or ‘behavioural’ in the psychology sense is frequently unclear . For instance , the cognitive actions of looking at previous depictions ( physical action ) and attending to visual features of sketch elements ( perceptual action ) likely involve cognitive processes such as selective attention and visual perception , but the actual acts of looking with the eyes and working on sketch elements with a pencil constitute external behaviour . As discussed further in Section 4 . 2 . 4 , Suwa et al . ( 1998 a ) gained preliminary insights into the purpose of sketches by coding an architect’s cognitive actions . Cognitive actions have also been examined by several other authors for varying purposes : • Kavakli & Gero ( 2002 ) coded protocols from expert and student architects , revealing diﬀerences in cognitive action trends over time and correlations between actions . For instance , the expert executed 6 simultaneous cognitive actions whilst the student executed 30 . Drawing , perceptual , and functional actions and goals ( Table 4 ) were also found to be more strongly correlated for the expert than the student . Kavakli & Gero ( 2001 ) oﬀer potential explanations for these diﬀerences based on mental imagery and working memory theory . • Bilda & Demirkan ( 2003 , p . 49 ) analysed six architects’ cognitive actions while sketching in digital versus traditional media , and found ‘designers were more eﬀective in using time , conceiving the problem , producing alternative solutions and in perceiving the visual – spatial features and the organizational relations of a design in traditional media’ . • Sun et al . ( 2013 ) analysed protocols gathered from 15 engineering students and proposed a relationship between cognitive eﬃciency and the number of : ( i ) cognitive actions executed ; and ( ii ) transitions among diﬀerent action categories and therefore , information processing levels .

Unexpected discovery and situated requirements invention Suwa et al . ( 2000 , p . 540 ) suggest that when a designer sketches a new feature intended to spatially relate to existing sketch features , unintended spatial relations are also ‘automatically produced’ regardless of whether they are actually heeded . Later in the task , visuo - spatial features created by these unintended relations may be ‘discovered in an unexpected way’ by the designer – a process termed unexpected discovery V 2 P 13 , and classed as a perceptual action ( Table 4 ) . Suwa et al . ( 2000 ) propose three types ( Figure 8 ) , namely discovery of : ( i ) the shape , size or texture of a sketch element ; ( ii ) a spatial or organisational relation among elements and ( iii ) a space existing between elements , an example of what may be termed ‘figure - ground reversal’ in perception research ( Suwa et al . 2000 , p . 546 ) . 18 / 36 https : / / www . cambridge . org / core / terms . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1017 / dsj . 2017 . 11 Downloaded from https : / / www . cambridge . org / core . University of Strathclyde , on 21 Jul 2017 at 09 : 58 : 05 , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use , available at Figure 8 . Types of unexpected discovery identified by Suwa et al . ( 2000 ) . An architect’s protocol revealed that throughout the task , unexpected discoveries were correlated with cognitive actions to set up goals focusing on new issues , which are then abstracted and carried through the design process as requirements . Since the invention of requirements by a designer in this manner is ‘situated in the environment in which they design’ – that is , aﬀected by their perception of sketches and the general context – the term situated invention V 2 P 14 or ‘S - invention’ is adopted ( Suwa et al . 2000 , pp . 539 – 547 ) . Suwa ( 2003 , p . 222 ) refers to unexpected discovery and S - invention in an overall sense as ‘problem - finding’ , i . e . ‘discovering and formulating one’s own problem to be solved’ . In more recent work , Yu et al . ( 2013 , p . 411 ) compared architects’ responses to unexpected discoveries in parametric versus geometric design environments . 4 . 2 . 4 . The purpose of sketching Generally , as Sections 4 . 2 . 1 – 4 . 2 . 3 show , sketching is considered to play a fundamental role in solution development during conceptual design . Suwa et al . ( 1998 a , p . 483 ) conclude based on an architect’s observed cognitive actions that sketches serve several purposes : • an ‘external memory in which to leave ideas for later inspection’ ; • a ‘provider of visual cues for association of functional issues’ and • a ‘physical setting in which functional thoughts are constructed on the fly in a situated way’ . However , several studies suggest that designers can still successfully develop a solution when unable to sketch . For example , Athavankar ( 1997 , p . 38 ) analysed a protocol gathered from a blindfolded designer unable to sketch during a task . They suggest that compared with the use of mental imagery alone , sketching ‘makes lesser demands on the cognitive resource that would be otherwise spent on maintaining the mental image’ , supporting the idea that sketches may serve 19 / 36 https : / / www . cambridge . org / core / terms . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1017 / dsj . 2017 . 11 Downloaded from https : / / www . cambridge . org / core . University of Strathclyde , on 21 Jul 2017 at 09 : 58 : 05 , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use , available at as an external memory . Nonetheless , the overall conclusion is that removing the ability to sketch did not limit the ‘ability to propose design moves , reflect upon them , transform ideas into new spatial configurations , propose and compare alternatives , evaluate them , take decisions and argue them out’ . Athavankar’s findings are supported in varying degrees by three later studies : • Bilda , Gero & Purcell ( 2006 , p . 604 ) found no significant diﬀerences in ‘design outcome scores , total number of cognitive actions ( except for recall activity ) and overall density of idea production’ in protocols gathered from three architects engaged in tasks under blindfolded and full - vision conditions . • Based on protocols gathered from six architects under the same conditions as above , Bilda & Gero ( 2007 , p . 364 ) conclude that sketching serves to oﬀ - load visuo - spatial working memory . However , they also conclude that for expert designers , the ‘use of tacit knowledge and the pre - existing chunks of spatial models from long - term memory could support the design process without the use of externalizations’ . • Athavankar , Bokil & Guruprasad ( 2008 , p . 338 ) analysed protocols gathered from four blindfolded architects who were free to move around a room whilst completing a design task . Participants were observed to ‘work with remarkable dexterity in spite of ( the ) artificially imposed eye mask constraint’ , employing two strategies where they either : ( i ) ‘moved in the real world space and carried the site ( of the building ) with them in their mind’s eye’ ; or ( ii ) ‘physically moved and paced within the stationary visualization of the site which they created in their mind’s eye’ ( Athavankar et al . 2008 , p . 329 ) . 5 . Discussion In Sections 3 and 4 , we explored 24 cognitive processes aligning with two viewpoints on the nature of designing : search and exploration . These were identified through a systematic review of protocol studies aiming to answer the following research question : What is our current understanding of the cognitive processes involved in conceptual design tasks carried out by individual designers ? In this section , key observations relating to the research question are discussed , along with future work and the limitations of the review . 5 . 1 . Key observations A key advantage of a systematic review is its capability to expose common findings and diﬀerences in perspectives . In this respect , studies aligning with search and exploration appear to cover similar design activities at a high level . However , they vary considerably regarding the concepts and terminology used to describe the cognitive processes involved , as Table 5 illustrates in the context of four typical conceptual design activities ( Sim & Duﬀy 2003 ; Jin & Chusilp 2006 ) . Note that the mapping of cognitive processes to design activities in Table 5 is largely based on interpretation rather than explicit statements by authors . That is , similarities we identified in the definitions and outputs of design activities and cognitive processes . For example , generation activities involve producing 20 / 36 https : / / www . cambridge . org / core / terms . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1017 / dsj . 2017 . 11 Downloaded from https : / / www . cambridge . org / core .

Please refer to Table 8 ( Appendix A ) for a list of authors investigating each process . ideas for solutions to design problems ( Jin & Chusilp 2006 ) . The integration and specification operators ( cognitive processes ) are described as producing spontaneous information and partial solutions , respectively ( Table 5 ) . Thus , we interpreted both as pertaining to the generation of ideas . Variation between viewpoints may be at least partly explained by diﬀerences in two fundamental design cognition paradigms , namely : ( i ) the problem solving paradigm , founded in Newell and Simon’s theories and models of human problem solving ( e . g . Newell & Simon 1972 ; Simon 1996 ) ; and ( ii ) the reflective paradigm , influenced heavily by Schon’s work on reflection - in - action ( e . g . Schön 1983 ; Schon & Wiggins 1992 ) . Each paradigm’s key perspectives ( Dorst & Dijkhuis 1995 ) are presented in Table 6 . It may be seen from Sections 3 and 4 that studies on search align primarily with the problem solving paradigm , whilst those on exploration 21 / 36 https : / / www . cambridge . org / core / terms . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1017 / dsj . 2017 . 11 Downloaded from https : / / www . cambridge . org / core . University of Strathclyde , on 21 Jul 2017 at 09 : 58 : 05 , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use , available at Table 6 . Key perspectives associated with design cognition paradigms Perspectives on the nature of : ( based on Dorst & Dijkhuis ( 1995 , pp . 262 – 263 ) ) Paradigms : Designer Design problem Designing Design knowledge Problemsolving Informationprocessorin an objective reality . Ill - defined , unstructured , stable . A rational search process . Design procedures and scientific laws . Reflective Person constructing their reality . Essentiallyunique , evolutionary . Reflectiveinteraction with broader design situation . When to apply what procedure or component of knowledge . align more closely with the reflective paradigm . Thus , it is perhaps unsurprising that the two sets diﬀer so considerably . In spite of the above diﬀerences , several broad commonalities between viewpoints may be observed . For instance , as Table 7 illustrates , studies on both search and exploration suggest the involvement of long - term memory retrieval in conceptual design tasks . Semantic ( i . e . pertaining to meaning ) and associative processes also appear to be commonly investigated , along with visual perception . Notably , we found that mental imagery is discussed fairly extensively in studies on exploration , but receives virtually no attention in studies on search . One potential explanation for this is the perspective that in design as search , a designer constitutes an information processing system in an objective reality ( Table 6 ) . In contrast , studies on design as exploration tend to view the designer as a person constructing their own reality ( Table 6 ) in line with the notion of situatedness . The involvement of memory , semantic and associative processes in conceptual design is consistent with creative ideation accounts in the broader psychology and neuroscience literature ( e . g . Mednick 1962 ; Runco & Chand 1995 ; Mumford , Medeiros & Partlow 2012 ; Benedek et al . 2013 ; Beaty et al . 2014 ; Abraham & Bubic 2015 ) . Nonetheless , the above inconsistencies make it diﬃcult to rationalise the range of cognitive processes identified from the sample . This obscures the fundamental nature of the processes studied by authors , and makes it diﬃcult to identify specific avenues for future work . Diﬃculties in comparing and synthesising studies are compounded by terminology with little meaning in psychology , such as seeing as ( Goldschmidt 1991 ) , unexpected discovery ( Suwa et al . 2000 ) and cognitive action ( Suwa et al . 1998 a ) . The use of such terms is particularly curious in the case of cognitive processes that are well established and clearly defined in psychology research . For instance , the process of unexpected discovery is likely an instance of what psychologists call ( visual ) perceptual re - organisation : the process of re - organising visual information to reveal previously unseen features and relations of visuo - spatial representations ( Bruce , Green & Georgeson 2003 ; Tversky 2014 ) . Nonetheless , the term ‘unexpected discovery’ is preferred by Suwa et al . ( 2000 ) . Another issue impeding rationalisation is that the terminology applied by authors appears at times to subsume multiple process types . For example , the process of seeing as seems to refer to the interaction of 22 / 36 https : / / www . cambridge . org / core / terms . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1017 / dsj . 2017 . 11 Downloaded from https : / / www . cambridge . org / core . University of Strathclyde , on 21 Jul 2017 at 09 : 58 : 05 , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use , available at visual perception , semantic processing and mental imagery processing during sketching ( Goldschmidt 1991 ) . 5 . 2 . Towards general formalisms Dinar et al . ( 2015 , p . 9 ) attribute the lack of standard approaches and interpretations across the field of design cognition research to a dearth of ‘cognitive models and theories of designer thinking’ . In this respect , we suggest that the inconsistencies discussed in Section 5 . 1 expose a lack of general models and theories of conceptual design cognition . That is , formalisms that describe design cognition using an established common language , and have explanatory and predictive capability with respect to the general population of designers . Although general cognitive models of creativity such as the Geneplore model ( Finke , Ward & Smith 1992 ) have been influential in design research ( e . g . Jin & Benami 2010 ) , they are not models of designing per se . Given that general formalisms are central to generating and testing scientific predictions about design cognition , and explaining the phenomena involved , their development constitutes a major challenge critical to advancing the field . Models and theories of the type outlined above must ultimately be informed by generalisable and statistically significant findings about cognitive processes and their interactions during design tasks . In this respect , whilst protocol analysis may be well suited to exploratory investigations in underdeveloped research areas , a key question is whether it is the best method for advancing the field towards general scientific formalisms . A conclusive answer is beyond our scope , but we shall comment briefly on some observations arising from our sample . A well - documented limitation of protocol analysis is its resource - intensive nature , arising from the involvement of extensive qualitative data processing . Consequently , protocol studies are frequently limited to small samples ( Dinar et al . 2015 ) . This means that whilst statistically significant results may be obtained , they are subject to a high margin of uncertainty ( Button et al . 2013 ) . In a sample of 1 , uncertainty is so high that the significance ( or otherwise ) of results is essentially irrelevant . Of the 33 articles reviewed in Sections 3 and 4 , 64 % employed a sample of five participants or less ; 33 % employed samples of two or less . Furthermore , column 4 in Table 8 demonstrates that of the 24 cognitive processes we identified , 50 % were supported by a mean sample of five participants or less , and 17 % by a mean sample of one or two . Thus , a considerable fraction of protocol study findings to date are likely subject to high uncertainty margins . Based on the above , we suggest testing the results of protocol studies using methods conducive to larger samples is a key challenge for design cognition research . One potential approach , typical of cognitive psychology , is the use of controlled experiments employing cognitive tests and outcome measures ( Dinar et al . 2015 ) . This permits considerably larger samples owing to the quantitative nature of the methods ; however , there are other limitations including reduced ecological validity , time restrictions , a lack of suitable tests and metrics , and reduced richness of the data generated ( Shah , Smith & Vargas - Hernandez 2003 ; Shah et al . 2012 , 2013 ; Khorshidi , Shah & Woodward 2014 ; Dinar et al . 2015 ) . Thus , eﬀectively combining rich , qualitative approaches like protocol analysis with more objective quantitative approaches may be a more fundamental challenge for design cognition researchers . 23 / 36 https : / / www . cambridge . org / core / terms . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1017 / dsj . 2017 . 11 Downloaded from https : / / www . cambridge . org / core .

Please refer to Table 8 ( Appendix A ) for a list of authors investigating each process . Finally , whilst identifying , defining , and organising cognitive processes to be reported in this paper , we were struck by the following question : what cognitive processes exist in a conceptual design context , and how should they be defined 24 / 36 https : / / www . cambridge . org / core / terms . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1017 / dsj . 2017 . 11 Downloaded from https : / / www . cambridge . org / core . University of Strathclyde , on 21 Jul 2017 at 09 : 58 : 05 , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use , available at and organised for study ? The structure of Table 8 presented us with an eﬀective reporting framework ; however , it may be less eﬀective as a foundation for future empirical work . This discussion aligns with current eﬀorts in cognitive neuroscience to develop a shared ontology of mental processes , representations , and tasks ( Poldrack et al . 2011 ; Poldrack 2015 ) . Whilst several design ontologies exist ( e . g . Gero 1990 ; Sim & Duﬀy 2003 ; Gero & Kannengiesser 2004 , 2007 ) , they are not necessarily intended to describe cognitive processes and those that do are not comprehensive . For example , Gero’s situated FBS ontology describes design in terms of broad interpretation , transformation , and focusing processes , encompassing more specific cognitive processes that are only briefly mentioned ( Gero & Kannengiesser 2004 , 2007 ) . A general , shared ontology of cognitive processes in conceptual design would not only provide a rational basis for model and theory development , but would also increase study comparability and foster a more integrated body of knowledge on design cognition . Furthermore , an ontology consistent with cognitive psychology and neuroscience would increase the capability for design cognition research to contribute to the broader body of scientific knowledge on human cognition . 5 . 3 . Review limitations We found that whilst a systematic review is a significant undertaking , it is a valuable approach for building a rich and comprehensive map of an area . Nonetheless , there are limitations and lessons to be learned . Firstly , we encountered considerable diﬃculties in defining suitable search terms ( Table 1 ) . For instance , applying the terms design * and protocol * returns hundreds of thousands of irrelevant hits from other fields owing to the ubiquitous phrases ‘experimental design’ and ‘experimental protocol’ . Some of our early test runs returned over a million results . This , coupled with the multitude of potential cognition keywords ( e . g . conceive , thinking , memory , fixation , etc . ) makes it diﬃcult to conduct an exhaustive search . Secondly , we found that the titles and abstracts of design research articles often lack key details on study focus and findings . This caused substantial diﬃculties during both the ( i ) identification and ( ii ) screening phases of the review ( Figure 1 ) : ( i ) search terms were not always reflected in the titles and abstracts of relevant articles , but searching the full text returned an unmanageable number of hits ; and ( ii ) rather than screening abstracts to determine article relevance as suggested by the PRISMA statement , we were often forced to read larger portions of the paper thereby protracting the process considerably . As the numbers in Figure 1 convey , we have covered a significant portion of the field ; however , owing to the above issues , we have still missed certain relevant publications . For example , Danielescu et al . ( 2012 ) report a protocol study on problem structuring ( relevant to Section 3 . 2 ) , which meets our inclusion criteria ( Table 2 ) . This article was not captured by our searches as the combination of terms applied did not appear in the search fields . We spent significant time and eﬀort trialling diﬀerent search terms in an attempt to minimise the exclusion of relevant material . We would advise other systematic reviewers to do the same ; furthermore , we would suggest that search terms are informed by a background review covering key terminology and concepts in the area of interest . We would also urge design researchers ( ourselves and colleagues included ) to consider the 25 / 36 https : / / www . cambridge . org / core / terms . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1017 / dsj . 2017 . 11 Downloaded from https : / / www . cambridge . org / core . University of Strathclyde , on 21 Jul 2017 at 09 : 58 : 05 , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use , available at possibility that their articles may eventually form part of a systematic review when constructing titles and abstracts , especially given the rising number of these reviews in our field ( e . g . Jiang & Yen 2009 ; Blizzard & Klotz 2012 ; Erkarslan 2013 ) . 6 . Conclusion This paper reports findings from the first systematic review of protocol studies focusing specifically on conceptual design cognition . We reviewed 47 studies on architectural design , engineering design and product design engineering in order to answer the following research question : What is our current understanding of the cognitive processes involved in conceptual design tasks carried out by individual designers ? In total , 35 distinct cognitive processes were identified . This paper reports a subset of 24 processes investigated in 33 studies aligning with two viewpoints on designing discussed in the broader literature : ( V1 ) design as search ( 10 processes , 41 . 7 % ) ; and ( V2 ) design as exploration ( 14 processes , 58 . 3 % ) . Our review forms part of a broader eﬀort to provide a more unified view of the field , and the remaining cognitive processes will be reported in a future paper on this theme . Our central finding is that protocol studies vary considerably with respect to the concepts and terminology used to describe design cognition . Nonetheless , several broad commonalities may be observed , including a focus on memory , semantic , associative , visual perceptual and mental imagery processes . Diﬀerences between studies aligning with search ( V1 ) and exploration ( V2 ) may be partly explained by underlying paradigmatic diﬀerences ; however , they also highlight a lack of general models and theories of conceptual design cognition . Given that these formalisms can be applied to generate and test predictions about design cognition that may advance knowledge in the field , their development constitutes a critical challenge . Two further suggested challenges for the field are : ( i ) testing protocol study findings using objective methods conducive to larger participant samples and ( ii ) developing a shared ontology of cognitive processes in conceptual design , to foster a more integrated and scientifically valuable body of knowledge on the phenomenon .

Overview of cognitive processes investigated in protocol studies on design as search and exploration ID Cognitive processes investigated Description N P 1 Authors Domains 2 VIEWPOINT 1 : DESIGN AS SEARCH V1 P1 Operators Operators are elementary processes transforming information from input to output states . They are the basic component of search ( V1 P4 ) and problem structuring ( V1 P8 ) processes . Search methods and control strategies are particular sequences of operators applied to reach a solution and manage the search process , respectively . Operators investigated in the reviewed studies fall into 4 categories : information gathering ; comprehending , representing , and structuring information ; generating and synthesising ; and evaluating and decision making . 5 Akin 1979 ; Chan 1990 ; Stauﬀer & Ullman 1991 ; Goel 1995 AD ; ED V1 P2 Retrieval of operators and other information from long - term memory . Knowledge of operators ( V1 P1 ) is stored within schemas ( i . e . networks of knowledge units ) in a designer’s long - term memory . During designing , relevant schemas are retrieved from long - term memory and the operators activated in working memory . They then act on other kinds of recalled information , e . g . technical knowledge , knowledge of past solutions , etc . , to eﬀect a change in the problem structure or design state . 2 Akin 1979 ; Chan 1990 ; Stauﬀer & Ullman 1991 AD ; ED V1 P3 Activation and manipulation of operators and other information in working memory . 27 / 3 6 h tt p s : / / www . c a m b r i dg e . o r g / c o r e / t e r m s . h tt p s : / / d o i . o r g / 10 . 1017 / d s j . 2017 . 11 D o w n l o a d e d f r o m h tt p s : / / www . c a m b r i dg e . o r g / c o r e .

( continued ) V1 P4 Solution search The process of transforming knowledge states in a problem space through operator execution ( V1 P1 ) , beginning with the problem state and progressing through intermediate design states until the goal ( i . e . solution ) state is reached . State transformations may be : ( i ) lateral , i . e . moving between diﬀerent ideas ; or ( ii ) vertical , i . e . increasing the level of detail of the same idea . 5 Akin 1979 ; Eckersley 1988 ; Chan 1990 ; Stauﬀer & Ullman 1991 ; Goel 1995 ; Chen & Zhao 2006 AD ; ED V1 P5 Inference The process of making logical judgements based on pre - existing information ( e . g . prior knowledge or previous judgements ) rather than direct observations . Both inductive and deductive inference may be involved in designing . 5 Eckersley 1988 ; Lloyd & Scott 1994 ED V1 P6 Analogical reasoning The process of using information about known semantic concepts to understand newly presented concepts , e . g . those contained within a design problem . This may be executed in a largely subconscious , automatic fashion using schemas retrieved from long - term memory ( V1 P2 ) , and is often viewed as a form of inductive reasoning ( see V1 P5 ) . 16 Ball et al . 2004 ; Liikkanen & Perttula 2009 ED ; PDE V1 P7 Case - based reasoning . The process of consciously mapping knowledge of previously encountered problems onto a current problem in order to generate concepts for solutions . Case - based reasoning may also be viewed as a form of inductive reasoning ( see V1 P5 ) . 16 Ball et al . 2004 AD ; ED ; PDE V1 P8 Problem structuring The process of defining the design problem prior to or during solution search ( V1 P4 ) . It involves gathering information , setting goals , and establishing constraints . Restructuring the problem results in changes to the nature and / or structure of goals , constraints , and / or requirements . 5 Akin 1979 ; Chan 1990 ; Goel 1995 AD ; ED V1 P9 Problem decomposition The process of breaking a design problem down into sub - problems by specifying sub - goals ( involved in problem structuring , V1 P8 ) . 8 Lloyd & Scott 1994 ; Liikkanen & Perttula 2009 ; Lee et al . 2014 AD ; ED ; PDE 28 / 3 6 h tt p s : / / www . c a m b r i dg e . o r g / c o r e / t e r m s . h tt p s : / / d o i . o r g / 10 . 1017 / d s j . 2017 . 11 D o w n l o a d e d f r o m h tt p s : / / www . c a m b r i dg e . o r g / c o r e .

The designer’s task environment is subdivided into : ( i ) a problem space , encompassing design requirements ; and ( ii ) a solution space , encompassing design solutions . The problem space is the basis for evaluating ideas in the solution space , whilst the solution space is the basis for evaluating / re - evaluating requirements in the problem space . Space interactions may add new variables to both ( e . g . new requirements and new solutions ) , thereby changing the focus of designing . 9 * Dorst & Cross 2001 ; Maher & Tang 2003 ; Maher & Kim 2006 ; Yu et al . 2014 AD ; PDE V2 P2 Visual reasoning Broadly speaking , the process of generating and reasoning about ideas whilst sketching . Visual reasoning is conceptualised in two ways , namely as : a process of seeing that and seeing as ( V2 P3 ) ; and interacting seeing ( V2 P5 ) , imagining ( V2 P6 ) , and drawing ( V2 P7 ) processes . 4 Goldschmidt 1991 ; Won 2001 ; Park & Kim 2007 AD ; PDE V2 P3 Seeing as and seeing that Two modes of reasoning that a designer continually shifts between during conceptual sketching : ( i ) seeing as , i . e . proposing properties / attributes for a design based on metaphors and analogies ; and ( ii ) seeing that , i . e . rationalising design decisions relating to these proposals . 5 Goldschmidt 1991 ; Won 2001 AD ; PDE 29 / 3 6 h tt p s : / / www . c a m b r i dg e . o r g / c o r e / t e r m s . h tt p s : / / d o i . o r g / 10 . 1017 / d s j . 2017 . 11 D o w n l o a d e d f r o m h tt p s : / / www . c a m b r i dg e . o r g / c o r e .

Reinterpretation is classed as a functional cognitive action ( V2 P8 ) . 1 Suwa et al . 1998 a , 2000 AD V2 P5 Seeing The process of perceiving , analysing , and interpreting visual information from external representations during sketching . Seeing is considered to interact with the processes of imagining ( V2 P6 ) and drawing ( V2 P7 ) . 2 Park & Kim 2007 PDE V2 P6 Imagining The process of generating new internal images , which may be transformed according to particular schemas ( see V1 P4 ) and maintained for externalisation via the process of drawing ( V2 P7 ) . Images may be generated using perceptual information from the process of seeing ( V2 P5 ) , and / or schemas retrieved from long - term memory . V2 P7 Drawing The process of evaluating and confirming internal images produced through the process of imagining ( V2 P6 ) , before externalising them to produce an external representation . V2 P8 Cognitive actions during sketching A set of interdependent processes involved in sketching that pertain to sensory information ( V2 P9 ) , perceptual information ( V2 P10 ) , and semantic information ( V2 P11 and V2 P12 ) . The processes arguably correspond to basic levels of human information processing . 5 Suwa et al . 1998 a , 2000 ; Kavakli & Gero 2001 , 2002 ; Bilda & Demirkan 2003 ; Bilda et al . 2006 ; Bilda & Gero 2007 ; Sun et al . 2013 AD ; PDE V2 P9 Physical actions A set of processes pertaining to sensory information during sketching ( V2 P8 ) , including : ( i ) making depictions ; and ( ii ) looking at previous depictions . 30 / 3 6 h tt p s : / / www . c a m b r i dg e . o r g / c o r e / t e r m s . h tt p s : / / d o i . o r g / 10 . 1017 / d s j . 2017 . 11 D o w n l o a d e d f r o m h tt p s : / / www . c a m b r i dg e . o r g / c o r e .

V2 P12 Conceptual actions A set of processes pertaining to semantic ( conceptual ) information during sketching ( V2 P8 ) , including : ( i ) preferential and aesthetic evaluation ; ( ii ) setting up goals ; and ( iii ) retrieving knowledge . V2 P13 Unexpected discovery of visuo - spatial features and relations in sketches The process of perceiving a visuo - spatial feature / relation in a sketch that was created unintentionally and is therefore unexpected . Three types are proposed , namely discovery of : ( i ) the shape , size , or texture of a sketch element ; ( ii ) a spatial or organisational relation among elements ; and ( iii ) a space existing between elements . Unexpected discoveries are classed as perceptual actions ( V2 P10 ) , and are argued to correlate with the process of situated invention ( V2 P14 ) . 2 Suwa et al . 2000 ; Suwa 2003 ; Yu et al . 2013 AD V2 P14 Situated invention of design requirements The process of developing new design requirements based on what is perceived in sketches . Situated invention involves defining goals focusing on new issues identified during sketching ( a conceptual action , V2 P12 ) , and abstracting these to form new design requirements . Situated invention is argued to correlate with the process of unexpected discovery ( V2 P13 ) . 1 N P = mean number of participants in cited studies . 2 Domain abbreviations : AD = architectural design ; ED = engineering design ; PDE = product design engineering . ∗ Number of participants not reported by all cited authors . 31 / 3 6 h tt p s : / / www . c a m b r i dg e . o r g / c o r e / t e r m s . h tt p s : / / d o i . o r g / 10 . 1017 / d s j . 2017 . 11 D o w n l o a d e d f r o m h tt p s : / / www . c a m b r i dg e . o r g / c o r e .
