Ligand - dependent downregulation of tyrosine kinase receptors is a critical step for modulating their activity . Upon ligand binding , hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) receptor ( Met ) is polyubiquitinated 1 and degraded 2 ; however , the mechanisms underlying HGF receptor endocytosis are not yet known . Here we demonstrate that a complex involving endophilins , CIN85 and Cbl controls this process . Endophilins 3 are regulatory com - ponents of clathrin - coated vesicle formation . Through their acyl - transferase activity they are thought to modify the membrane phospholipids and induce negative curvature and invagination of the plasma membrane during the early steps of endocytosis 4 . Furthermore , by means of their Src - homology 3 domains , endo - philins are able to bind CIN85 , a recently identiﬁed protein that interacts with the Cbl proto - oncogene 5 . Cbl , in turn , binds and ubiquitinates activated HGF receptor , and by recruiting the endophilin – CIN85 complex , it regulates receptor internaliz - ation . Inhibition of complex formation is sufﬁcient to block HGF receptor internalization and to enhance HGF - induced signal transduction and biological responses . These data provide further evidence of a relationship between receptor - mediated signalling and endocytosis , and disclose a novel functional role for Cbl in HGF receptor signalling . Cell stimulation with growth factors usually leads to increased receptor tyrosine kinase activity , intracellular substrate recruitment , receptor internalization by accelerated endocytosis through cla - thrin - coated pits , and ﬁnally , degradation 6 – 8 . Several data sets suggest that ligand - dependent internalization may be a principal process regulating the duration and propagation of the signal initiated by tyrosine kinase receptors , thereby preventing over - stimulation that could potentially lead to cellular transformation . To clarify the molecular mechanisms connecting receptor - mediated signalling to endocytosis by means of clathrin - coated pits , we searched for proteins interacting with endophilins , by using the yeast two - hybrid system . A bait construct , encoding the full - length human endophilin A3 , fused in - frame with the Gal4 DNA - binding domain , was used to screen a human brain complementary DNA library . Approximately 500 , 000 transformants were analysed , leading to isolation of 27 positive colonies . Sequence analysis of the prey plasmids revealed that ﬁve of them encoded for dynamins ( well known interactors of endophilins ) 9 , whereas three clones of differ - ent length represented overlapping cDNAs for CIN85 ( Fig . 1a ) . CIN85 is a member of a newly discovered subfamily of adaptor molecules including CMS 10 and CD2AP 11 , and was recently shown to bind the Cbl proto - oncogene product 5 . CIN85 contains three amino - terminal Src - homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains , followed by a proline - rich domain containing two sequences ( PKKPPPP and PKKPRPP ) that are optimal consensus sites for endophilin SH3 binding 12 and a carboxy - terminal coiled - coil domain , essential for dimerization 13 . As shown in Fig . 1b , pull - down experiments con - ﬁrmed that a recombinant glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fusion protein encoding full - length endophilin A3 was able to interact with letters to nature NATURE | VOL 416 | 14 MARCH 2002 | www . nature . com 187 © 2002 Macmillan Magazines Ltd CIN85 , and that the SH3 domains of the known endophilins are necessary and sufﬁcient for this binding . Co - immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that endophilin A3 and CIN85 also associate in mammalian cells ( Supplementary Information Fig . 1 ) . As endophilin A3 binds CIN85 , which in turn interacts with Cbl 5 , we investigated whether these three proteins can form a ternary complex in cells . As shown in Fig . 1c , in transfected cells endophilin A3 , CIN85 and Cbl associate in a complex ; moreover , a dominant interfering form of CIN85 , which is unable to interact with Cbl ( CIN85 - PCC , containing only the proline - rich and the coiled - coil domains ) , prevents complex formation . Cbl binds to several activated tyrosine kinase receptors , acting either as a transducer 14 or as a ubiquitin ligase , and thus has a role in receptor downregulation 15 . In particular , the role of Cbl has been studied in signal transduction activated by HGF receptor 16 , the heterodimeric tyrosine kinase with a relative molecular mass of 190 , 000 ( 190K ) that is encoded by the Met proto - oncogene 17 . After HGF binding , signalling is elicited through receptor interactions with the major substrate Gab1 ( ref . 18 ) and several SH2 - containing proteins 19 , one of which is the Cbl adaptor protein , known to bind to the Met tail 16 and to have a positive role in mitogen - activated protein ( MAP ) kinase activation 20 . After ligand stimulation , Met is rapidly polyubiquitinated 1 and degraded 2 ; however , the molecular mechanisms involved in this process are unknown . We therefore investigated whether Cbl has a role in HGF receptor ubiquitination . As shown in Fig . 2a , Cbl binds to the receptor ( right panel ) and induces its ubiquitination ( left panel ) . On the contrary , a Cbl mutant devoid of ubiquitin ligase activity ( Cbl - 70Z ) interacts with Met , but is unable to induce its ubiquitination ( left panel ) . Notably , this mutant does not act in a dominant interfering manner with respect to preventing Met downregulation ( Supplementary Information Fig . 2B ) . The interaction between Cbl and Met requires the presence of Y1356 in the receptor docking site 16 . We show here that a Cbl mutant lacking the SH2 domain is still able to associate with Met , although to a lesser extent , and to ubiquitinate the receptor ( Supplementary Information Fig . 2A ) . It is possible that the interaction between this Cbl mutant and Met might occur indirectly by means of a bridge made by the SH3 domain of the adaptor protein Grb2 and the Cbl proline - rich region . This alterna - tive modality of interaction has recently been observed also for Cbl and the EGF receptor ( Y . Yarden , personal communication ) . We then investigated whether the association of endophilin , CIN85 and Cbl was modulated by HGF . Indeed , under physiological conditions , Cbl binds to ligand - activated HGF receptor , becomes tyrosine phosphorylated , and recruits the CIN85 – endophilin com - plex ( Fig . 2b ) . Furthermore , endophilins are constitutively associ - ated to HGFR in a cell line ( GTL16 ) where Met is basally activated 17 ( Supplementary Information Fig . 3 ) . Endophilins are known to be regulatory elements of the machin - ery controlling endocytosis through clathrin - coated pits 3 , 21 – 23 . To verify whether the Cbl – CIN85 – endophilin complex recruited to Met has a role in receptor internalization , we impaired complex formation by using dominant interfering forms of each component of the complex . As shown by immunoﬂuorescence analysis ( Fig . 3a , b ) , the HGF – HGFR complex is not internalized in cells expressing mutants of Cbl ( Cbl - 480 , a mutant that is unable to interact with CIN85 ; I . Dikic , personal communication ) , CIN85 ( CIN85 - PCC ) and endophilin ( Endo - SH3 , a mutant still able to bind CIN85 but devoid of enzymatic activity ) .

Moreover , HGFR tyrosine phosphorylation is prolonged . Of note , in the presence of dominant interfering forms of either CIN85 or endophilin , the interaction between Cbl and Met is not impaired , Cbl becomes tyrosine phosphorylated ( Supplementary Information Fig . 4 ) , and Cbl - induced HGFR ubiquitination is unaffected ( Supplementary Infor - mation Fig . 2A and data not shown ) . To assess the signalling capacity of HGFR not undergoing down - regulation , we evaluated its ability to recruit signal transducers in cells expressing the interfering form of endophilin . We found that when the receptor is not internalized , it remains tyrosine phos - phorylated for a longer time ( Fig . 3c ) , increasing binding and phosphorylation of its major substrate Gab1 ( Fig . 4a ) . This increase of substrate recruitment and phosphorylation leads to enhance - ment of HGF - induced motility ( Fig . 4b ) . We also observed a basal increase of motogenic properties , probably due to the fact that blocking of ligand - induced endocytosis may affect several recep - tors 24 , and thus enhance cell responsivity to serum chemotactic molecules . To explain our observations we propose the following model . Upon ligand activation , HGF receptor becomes tyrosine phos - phorylated , binds and phosphorylates Cbl , which in turn targets the receptor to clathrin - coated pits by recruiting the CIN85 – endophilin complex . This complex drives plasma membrane inva - gination and vesicle formation , thus resulting in negative modu - lation of signal transduction and biological responses . Our results also show that Cbl has a dual role in receptor signalling : it acts as a positive transducer , by triggering signals from the activated recep - tor , and as a negative modulator , by ubiquitinating the receptor and activating the endocytic machinery through recruitment of CIN85 and endophilin . Moreover , this role of Cbl in induction of endo - cytosis can be functionally separated from its E3 ligase activity . As a similar role for the Cbl – CIN85 – endophilin complex has been demonstrated for downregulation of EGF receptors 24 , the mechan - ism we describe seems to represent a general way to downregulate activated tyrosine kinase receptors .

Host defences to microorganisms rely on a coordinated interplay between the innate and adaptive responses of immunity 1 . Infec - tion with intracellular bacteria triggers an immediate innate response requiring macrophages , neutrophils and natural killer cells , whereas subsequent activation of an adaptive response through development of T - helper subtype 1 cells ( T H 1 ) proceeds during persistent infection 1 .
