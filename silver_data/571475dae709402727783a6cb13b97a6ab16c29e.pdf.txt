Jones , 1 , 2 * Stefan Wuchty , 3 * † Brian Uzzi 1 , 3 , 4 * ‡ This paper demonstrates that teamwork in science increasingly spans university boundaries , a dramatic shift in knowledge production that generalizes across virtually all fields of science , engineering , and social science . Moreover , elite universities play a dominant role in this shift . By examining 4 . 2 million papers published over three decades , we found that multi - university collaborations ( i ) are the fastest growing type of authorship structure , ( ii ) produce the highest - impact papers when they include a top - tier university , and ( iii ) are increasingly stratified by in - group university rank . Despite the rising frequency of research that crosses university boundaries , the intensification of social stratification in multi - university collaborations suggests a concentration of the production of scientific knowledge in fewer rather than more centers of high - impact science . I n May 1845 , Samuel F . B . Morse telegraphed the first electronic message , “ What hath God wrought ? ” from Washington , DC , to Balti - more and declared an end to “ the tyranny of dis - tance . ” Yet , in the 150 years since Morse ’ s breakthrough , the production of science has had a reputation for geographic localization . Early 20th - century German universities singularly led in chemistry and physics , creating the first com - mercial dyes and nuclear and rocket programs ( 1 ) . Silicon Valley became a renowned incubator for excellence in technology ( 2 ) , and the Uni - versity of Chicago has been a persistent center for Nobel Prize winners in economics . Nonetheless , recent observers have suggested a weakening link between location and scientific research — a “ death of distance , ” in popular coin - age ( 3 ) . In this view , technology is inevitably re - moving the last barriers of distance , widening access to geographically distant collaborators with potential implications for the location , re - search quality , and social stratification of science ( 4 , 5 ) . Researchers report , for example , a modest rise in collaborations between research insti - tutions in a limited sample of fields ( 6 – 8 ) , al - though other authors conclude that face - to - face contact and the “ 30 - feet collaboration rule ” nonetheless continue to encourage collaboration at home universities ( 9 – 11 ) . Although these studies suggest a possible trend toward collaboration between authors at different universities , the generalizability of the shift remains unclear , as does the association with research impact and the geographic and social structure of collaboration . With an eye toward understanding the role that multi - university col - laborations play in the production of science , we examined ( i ) trends in multi - university collabo - rations across the full spectrum of academic fields , ( ii ) the association of these changes with research impact , and ( iii ) the role of elite and nonelite universities in these trends . Our sample focuses on a set of 662 major U . S . universities and includes 4 . 2 million research papers in the Web of Science database , covering 172 fields of science and engineering ( SE ) , 54 fields of social sciences ( SS ) , and 27 fields of arts and humani - ties ( AH ) from 1975 to 2005 [ the supporting online material ( SOM ) further defines the sample design , and table S1 lists the universities ] . Our analysis indicates a remarkable and near - ly universal rise since 1975 in the frequency of collaborations between authors located at dif - ferent universities . Figure 1 shows the share of research papers published by solo authors , collab - orators at the same university , and collaborators between schools . In SE , between - school collab - orations were rare in 1975 , which suggests that this type of collaboration is a relatively modern phenomenon ( Fig . 1A ) . Moreover , among all three authorship arrangements , between - school collaboration is the fastest - and only steadily growing segment , quadrupling its share in SE between 1975 and 2005 to 32 . 8 % . Figure 1B shows that SS have experienced similar trends ; the share of SS papers written in multi - university collaborations rose even more rapidly over the 30 - year period to a peak share of 34 . 4 % . These upward trends appear even stronger upon fur - ther including publications with collaborators outside the sample of major U . S . universities ( fig . S1 ) . Although the rate of increase in multi - university collaborations is essentially constant over our entire period , we found an unusual jump of 3 . 4 % in SE , which is large ( P < 0 . 0001 ) com - pared to the typical year - on - year increase of 0 . 8 % . Although this single event occurred in 1998 , a period when the Internet and other in - formation and computing technologies were spreading widely , multi - university collaborations in SE continued at the pre - 1998 rate of growth thereafter . SS show little unusual acceleration in this period . These findings suggest that , although communication technologies may be generally important , multi - university collaborations were largely driven by factors that predated recent communication technologies . Table 1 demonstrates the generality of these patterns across individual fields . It indicates that 98 % ( 168 of 172 ) of the SE subfields increased their share of between - school collaborations . In SS , 100 % ( 54 of 54 ) of the subfields increased their share of research written by coauthors at multiple schools . AH showed little disposition for teamwork in general ( Fig . 1C ) ; a more modest majority of fields ( 67 % , 18 of 27 ) demonstrated a rise in multi - school collaboration . Our analyses further show thatthe trendtoward multi - university collaboration in SE and SS is present for teams of any size ( fig . S2 ) ( 12 ) . Although the incidence of between - school collaboration has grown rapidly , the average dis - tance between collaborators has risen only slight - ly ( fig . S3 ) . In 1975 , the mean distance between collaborators in SE was 750 miles , whereas it was 800 miles in 2005 ( 13 ) . The mean distance between collaborators in SS increased from 725 to 800 miles over the same period . Median dis - tances rose from 510 to 560 miles ( SE ) and 530 to 580 miles ( SS ) . Spatially , this suggests that the death of distance in U .

It is not the length of a scientist ’ s reach that has changed but rather the incidence of reaching across university boundaries . To analyze and compare the citation impact of between - school collaborations and within - school collaborations , we estimated the probability that papers written with these two different authorship structures receive above - average citations . We focused on papers published from 1995 to 2005 and on between - school collaborations with two university affiliations , using regression analysis to account for subfield , team size , and publication year differences ( 13 ) . Figure 2 presents three primary findings . In both SE and SS , between - school collaborations have a citation - impact advantage over within - school collaborations . Averaging over all schools in our sample ( Fig . 2A ) , within - school collabo - rations have a baseline probability of producing papers with above - average citations of 32 . 7 % in SE and 34 . 1 % in SS . For between - school col - laborations , the marginal probability is 2 . 9 % higher in SE ( P < 0 . 0001 ) or 8 . 8 % above the baseline rate ( 0 . 029 / 0 . 327 ) . In SS , the marginal gains of between - school collaborations are larger at 5 . 8 % ( P < 0 . 0001 ) or 16 . 7 % above the baseline rate ( 0 . 058 / 0 . 341 ) . In Fig . 2B , we further disaggregated the between - school collaborations based on the ranks of the collaborating schools . Schools were ranked by the total number of citations received by the papers published at the school in the cor - responding period . We considered only within - school publications in this ranking method so that the school rankings are independent of each university ’ s performance in between - school col - laborations . Tier I schools are those ranked in the top 5 % , tier II are in the top 6 to 10 % , tier III are in the top 11 to 20 % , and tier IV are the re - mainder . Other ranking methods were considered below as robustness checks ( 14 ) . We took within - school collaborations as the baseline case for each tier and compared the citation impact of multi - university collaborationswiththatbaseline . These results suggest that collaborations between tier I schools show a substantial impact advan - tage over tier I within - school collaborations . For example , a team of two authors from an elite school such as Harvard tends to produce lower - impact papers than a team of two authors with one at Harvard and the other at Stanford . This finding may challenge claims that within - school collaboration provides decisive advantages by lowering communication and monitoring costs , conveying tacit information , and enabling im - promptu interaction . Specifically , in SE , circa 1995 to 2005 , a collaboration between tier I insti - tutions is 6 . 19 % more likely ( P < 0 . 0001 ) to be of high impact than a tier I within - school collabo - ration , which is a 17 % increase in the baseline rate ( 0 . 062 / 0 . 372 ) . In SS fields , there is an even larger 11 . 7 percentage - point increase ( P < 0 . 0001 ) in the probability of being a high - impact paper , which is a 24 % increase in the baseline rate ( 0 . 117 / 0 . 406 ) . We also observe that the advan - tage of intra - tier partnerships exists for tier II and tier III partnerships and declines as the rank of schools decreases . For partnerships between tier IV schools , the advantage disappears in SS and is slightly negative for SE fields , which suggests that the advantage found in partnerships between similar - quality schools is dominated by , and most pronounced among , elite institutions . Table S2 considers cross - tier collaborations and shows that their citation impact tends to lie between the impact of the upper and lower tiers ’ within - schoolcollaborations . Thebetween - school impact tends to lie closer to the upper - tier baseline than the lower - tier baseline . This finding suggests that cross - tier between - school collaboration may follow a “ strongest - partner ” rather than a “ weakest - partner ” model , with tier I pulling up tier IV more than tier IV pulls down tier I . Tables S3 and S4 substantiate all the results for alternative school - ranking methods ( 14 ) , and fig . S5 presents the raw citation impact data , unconditional on field or team size , and shows similar findings . Further exploring the special role of elite universities in the production of multi - school re - search , Table 2 decomposes the intensity of multi - university collaboration by university . Con - sidering papers with two university affiliations , the table cells above the diagonal show the actual share of multi - university collaborations for 2001 to 2005 for each tier pairing , which indicates that elite schools dominate multi - university collabo - rations in the 2001 – 2005 period . Just 5 % of schools ( tier I ) hold places in 59 . 7 % of multi - university collaborations in SE ( tier I row sum , above the diagonal ) . In SS , the corresponding fraction is 56 . 2 % . Conversely , only 18 . 4 % of SE multi - university collaborations were formed sole - ly among authors from tier III and IVuniversities , even though these universities are 90 % of the schools in the sample . We further examined the intensity of stratifi - cation in multi - university partnerships by com - paring actual collaboration rates between tier pairings with a baseline model of random match - ing across tiers . Defining P j as the fraction of multi - university papers that include tier j , the probability that a multi - university paper includes tiers j and k underrandommatchingis 2P j P k if j ≠ k and P j P k if j = k . The cells of Table 2 , below the diagonals , show the ratio of the actual frequency of a given tier - pairing to the expected frequency under random matching . Ratios > 1 indicate a greater propensity for tier pairings than expected by random matching and ratios < 1 indicate a lesser propensity for tier pairings . Fig . 1 . The rise in multi - university collaboration . By comparing the incidence of papers produced by different authorship structures , we see that the share of multi - university collaborations strongly increases from 1975 to 2005 . This rise is especially strong in SE ( A ) and SS ( B ) , whereas it appears weakly in AH ( C ) , in which collaboration of any kind is rare . The share of single - university collab - orations remains roughly constant with time , whereas the share of solo - authored papers strongly declines in SE and SS . Table 1 . Patterns by subfield . For each subfield , we calculated the fractions of papers written as within - school collaborations and between - school collaborations in 1975 – 1979 and 2001 – 2005 . Comparing the incidence of these authorship structures between the early and late periods , we determined the number of subfields ( N ) and the fraction of subfields ( % ) for which the share of each type of collaboration is increasing .

In SS , this inequality is even stronger , for which tier I – tier I collaborations were 27 % more common than expected ( P < 0 . 001 ) , and tier I – tier IV collaborations were 32 % less common ( P < 0 . 001 ) . Meanwhile , both SE and SS show that collaborations limited to lower - tier schools were substantially more common than ex - pected . Lower - tier schools did reach across univer - sity boundaries , but they tended to interact within theirown tier , echoing the in - groupstatus - matching behavior of elite schools . However , recalling the results in Fig . 2 , the tendency to favor in - group matching was an advantage for tier I schools but a disadvantage for those of tier IV . Other ranking methods ( 14 ) demonstratedthe robustness of these stratification tendencies ( tables S6 and S7 ) . The SOM further considers the evolution of social and geographic stratification over time . Table S5 demonstrates that tier I – tier I collabo - rations rose with time as compared with the ex - pected rate , whereas tier I – tier IV collaborations fell . Thus elite schools have been increasingly likely to capture the impact advantages of their collaborations , whereas tier IV schools appear to lose ground in accessing top - tier collaborations . Finally , figs . S6 to S9 illustrate the intersection of social and geographic distance for the Boston , Chicago , LosAngeles , NewYork , NorthCarolina , and San Francisco research centers . Top schools in these regions increasingly collaborated with geographically distant top schools , whereas their other partnerships declined . Partnership choice increasingly appears to be based on who the col - laborators are rather than where they are , with an emphasis on in - group status matching . The shift toward cross - institutional collabora - tion suggests a fundamental transformation in the production of high - impact science . Prior work established that teamwork has become ubiquitous across scientific fields and supplanted solo - authored work in the production of the highest - impact research ( 15 , 16 ) . We demonstrate that the rising collaboration in science is increasingly composed of collaborations that span university boundaries . Moreover , elite universities play a dominant role in this shift . We found that multi - university partnerships ( i ) are the fastest growing type of authorship structure , ( ii ) produce the highest - impact papers when they include a top - tier university , and ( iii ) are increasingly stratified by in - group university rank . Thus , although geo - graphic distance is of decreasing importance , social distance is of increasing importance in re - search collaborations . Elite universities are more intensely interdependent , playinga higher - impact and increasingly visible role in SE and SS . Consistent with some claims , we observed that rapid technology advances in the 1990s may have modestly accelerated between - school col - laboration , but our results more generallyindicate a smooth growth in multi - school collaboration that substantially predated this period . These findings suggest a more complex relationship be - tween social relations and technology in science , with collaboration technologies and social net - works potentially being an endogenous outcome of the burgeoning interest in research partnerships ( 8 , 17 – 19 ) . Others have argued that increasing specialization drives collaboration ( 20 ) , which , coupled with the limited capacity of academic departments to encapsulate more than a fraction of a field ’ s specializations , may promote institu - tionally boundaryless collaborations in the search for high - impact science . However , whereas the greater geographic interconnectedness of univer - sities would appear to make geography less important , the corresponding intensification of social stratification in multi - university collabora - tion tends to embed the production of outstanding scientific knowledge in fewer rather than more centers of high - impact science . The dominant role Fig . 2 . The impact ad - vantage of between - school collaborations . The citation impact of between - versus within - school collaborations is compared . Impact is mea - sured as the probability that a paper receives above - average citations . For within - school publica - tions , the baseline proba - bilities of a high - impact paper are 0 . 327 , 0 . 372 , 0 . 327 , 0 . 295 , and 0 . 235 in SE and 0 . 341 , 0 . 406 , 0 . 366 , 0 . 303 , and 0 . 229 in SS for all schools , tier I , tier II , tier III , and tier IV , respectively .

We also found ( fig . S2 ) that social scientists have a substantially higher propensity to engage in multi - university collaboration for any given team size . For example , a team of size 2 in SS operated across universities nearly 40 % of the time in the year 2000 , whereas the corresponding propensity in SE was 18 % , a 2 - to - 1 ratio that holds approximately over time . This difference may follow from conditions such as the relative capital intensity of lab sciences , which particularly favor colocation in SE . The relative tendency toward multi - university collaboration in SS is offset by the greater incidence of large teams in SE and the fact that larger teams are more likely to be assembled from multiple universities . Hence , the absolute fraction of multi - university work turns out to be similar in both SE and SS ( Fig . 1 ) . 13 . We focused on cases with two university affiliations , which allowed us to categorize multi - university collaborations into explicit tier pairings , as seen in Fig . 2 . Two - university collaborations represent over 90 % of multi - university collaborations ( fig . S4 ) . The regressions are linear probability models ( ordinary least squares ) , in which an indicator for whether the paper is above the mean impact in its field and year is regressed on indicator variables for authorship structure ( solo - authored , within - school collaboration , or between - school collaboration ) , publication year , team size , and subfield , with standard errors clustered by subfield . 14 . To determine the ranking of each school , we pooled all papers that have been published entirely by a given school in each year by using only within - school collaborations and papers of single authors . We then counted the number of citations those papers received and ranked the schools according to their total citation count . This ranking method is equivalently described as the average citation impact ( a quality measure ) times the number of publications ( a quantity measure ) . Between - school papers were omitted from the measure of school ranking to ensure that the papers used to assign tiers were independent of the papers used to assess between - school impact . Alternative measures are average citation impact , as a pure quality measure , and the university Hirsch index ( 21 ) , which emphasizes very - high - impact papers . A university ’ s Hirsch index for a given publication period is the largest number H such that H of its papers received at least H citations . As noted in the text and detailed in tables S2 , S4 , S6 , and S7 , the patterns of impact and stratification are consistent across these alternative ranking approaches .
