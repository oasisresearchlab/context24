According to this dogma , once genetic information is transferred into a protein , it cannot be reversed back into the DNA se - quence . This initiated a paradigm shift in the logic of biology . The initial step in the transfer of genetic information is a process known as “ transcription , ” where an enzyme called RNA polymerase synthesizes an RNA copy of the DNA sequence . Through past biochemical , structural , and whole - genome sequencing studies , the molecular mechanisms of transcription by RNA poly - merase have been elucidated in great detail . However , the temporal dynamics of this process still remains an outstanding ques - tion in modern biology . From bacteria to humans , emerging evi - dence suggests that the prevalent feature of gene expression conserved across species is intermittent bursts of de novo transcription or transcriptional bursting . Transcriptional bursting regulates gene expression during cell fate determination and disease process - es in mammals . It has also been shown that transcriptional bursting plays a critical role in dosage compensation mechanisms of X - linked genes during sex specification , as well as in establishing the temporal and spatial patterns of gene expression during Droso - phila embryogenesis . Transcriptional burst - ing is also reported to serve as a major source of random effects in gene expression and contribute to cellular variability within a population of cells . The first evidence for transcriptional bursting was obtained from electron microscopy analysis of chromatin spreads prepared from early Drosophila embryos more than 40 years ago ( 2 ) . Recent advances in high - resolution imaging methods such as MS2 / PP7 RNA la - beling and single - molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) methods enable scientists to directly visualize transcription - al bursting at single - cell resolution in a highly quantitative manner . However , the molecular mechanism underlying the control of transcriptional bursting still remains a central question in the field . ROLES OF ENHANCERS IN THE CONTROL OF TRANSCRIPTIONAL BURSTING Enhancers are short segments of regulatory DNA that consist of a cluster of binding sites for sequence - specific transcription factors ( TFs ) and coactivators . They play a funda - mentally important role in determining when and in which cell types genes should be transcribed in response to intrinsic and extrinsic signals . Recent whole - genome studies by the ENCODE consortium sug - gested that the human genome contains ~ 900 , 000 putative enhancers . Quantitative MS2 / PP7 live - imaging and single - molecule FISH studies revealed that enhancers regu - late the level of gene activities by modulat - ing the kinetics of transcriptional bursting from linked genes in Drosophila and mam - malian cells ( 3 , 4 ) . Single - cell RNA - seq analysis demonstrated that regulation of transcriptional bursting by enhancers is a widespread mechanism throughout the mammalian genome . According to a textbook model , enhanc - ers are thought to activate transcription through stable association with target gene promoters by looping out intervening se - quences . However , dynamic modulation of bursting kinetics by enhancers appears to be incompatible with this traditional static “ looping ” model . Importantly , MS2 / PP7 live - imaging analysis demonstrated that a single enhancer can co - activate two linked genes simultaneously ( 4 ) , giving rise to the possibility that enhancers activate transcrip - tion by producing a nuclear microenviron - ment where transcription machineries are locally concentrated at specific genomic lo - cations , thereby acting as a “ hub ” for driving transcriptional bursting . In line with these findings , increasing ev - idence suggests that many TFs and coactiva - tors contain intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) to facilitate dynamic condensate for - mation within a nucleus . However , there is a critical lack of understanding in the func - tional significance of these TF / coactivator condensates in the control of gene expres - sion , and , therefore , it remains to be deter - mined whether enhancers actually form “ hubs ” during induction of transcriptional bursting in living cells . A recent super - reso - lution live visualization of TFs together with transcriptional bursting provided direct ev - idence that the dynamic assembly and disas - sembly of TF clusters at enhancers are a major source of transcriptional bursting in developing Drosophila embryos ( 5 ) . Fusion of IDRs with TFs facilitated both the forma - tion of TF clusters and the rate of burst in - duction , suggesting that multivalent protein - protein interactions mediated by IDRs serve as a key regulatory step to control transcriptional bursting . Recent whole - genome studies have reported that the majority of enhancer - promoter con - tacts , as well as the level of nascent RNA synthesis , are not affected by acute depletion of architectural proteins such as CTCF and cohesin in mammalian cells ( 6 ) or massive 1 Laboratory of Transcription Dynamics , Research Center for Biological Visualization , Institute for Quantitative Biosciences , The University of Tokyo , Bunkyo - ku , Tokyo 113 - 0032 , Japan . 2 Department of Life Sciences , Gradu - ate School of Arts and Sciences , The University of Tokyo , Bunkyo - ku , Tokyo 113 - 0032 , Japan . * Corresponding author .

This suggests that TF clusters assembled at enhancers can exert their burst - inducing ac - tivity independently of the formation of to - pologically associating domains ( TADs ) . FUNCTIONAL INTERPLAY BETWEEN TETHERING ELEMENTS AND TF CLUSTERS As discussed above , one of the notable fea - tures of enhancers is their ability to co - acti - vate multiple genes simultaneously ( 4 ) . Visualization of this co - activation process with TFs in living Drosophila embryos showed that two co - activated genes physi - cally share a common TF cluster during the induction of transcriptional bursting ( 5 ) , further supporting the idea that enhanc - ers act as a hub for gene activation . A key question arises : Does co - regulation of multiple genes by shared enhancers occur in the context of endogenous eukaryotic genomes ? Recent high - resolution Micro - C analysis revealed the existence of focal pro - moter - promoter contacts between two neighboring genes , both in Drosophila and mammals ( 6 , 7 ) . In Drosophila , such focal promoter - promoter contacts are often found to connect two distant paralogous genes that exhibit very similar expression patterns during early embryogenesis ( 7 ) . CRISPR - Cas9 – mediated genome - editing analysis demonstrated that the expression of a pair of connected paralogs is driven by shared enhancers . MS2 / PP7 live - imaging analysis further revealed that these genes exhibit highly coordinated bursting kinetics although they are separat - ed by very large linear genomic distanc - es ( 7 ) . If this is the case , then how do two distant paralogous genes come into the physical proximity of common TF clusters formed at shared enhancers ? Promoter - pro - moter contacts mediated by a previously un - characterized class of regulatory DNAs called “ tethering elements ” appear to un - derlie long - range regulatory connectivity between two paralogs by bringing the genes close together in 3D genomic space . Tethering elements have a unique capability of mediating long - range focal interaction independently of TADs but do not possess enhancer activity by themselves ( 8 ) . Tether - ing elements can even mediate focal interac - tion between two distant genomic loci bypassing several TADs . When a tethering element is lost from one of a pair of paralo - gous genes , shared enhancers are no longer able to equally access two promoters at the same time , resulting in biased burst induc - tion from the enhancer - proximal gene ( 7 ) . Together , these observations suggest that promoter - promoter contacts mediated by Fig . 1 . Dynamic assembly of TF cluster at enhancers is critical to control transcriptional bursting .

Analogous to the control of multiple genes by a single ON / OFF regulatory switch in the bacterial operon system ( e . g . , the lac operon ) , a term “ topological operon ” was recently coined to describe the co - regulation of mul - tiple genes by shared enhancers in eukaryot - ic genomes ( 7 ) . It is reasonable to assume that the dynamic assembly and disassembly of common TF clusters within a topological operon facilitate coordinated regulation of functionally related genes at the single - cell level . In addition to Drosophila , Arabidopsis was recently suggested as having a topolog - ical operon at the thalianol biosynthetic gene cluster . THE MOLECULAR FUNCTION OF TF CLUSTERS AT ENHANCERS The next question is how the dynamic as - sembly and disassembly process of TF clus - ters at enhancers leads to transcriptional bursting . Previous super - resolution analysis demonstrated that RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) and Mediator also undergo dynamic clustering , frequently overlapping with each other , in living mouse ES cells ( 9 ) . Given that TFs exert their regulatory func - tions through recruitment of coactivators such as Mediator , it is tempting to speculate that TF clusters formed at enhancers drive transcriptional bursting by transiently increasing the local concentration of Medi - ator and Pol II at the site of transcription through molecular blending with these clusters ( Fig . 1B ) . After the consumption of locally concentrated Pol II through its consecutive loading onto associated genes for burst induction , TF clusters at enhancers disappear very rapidly ( 5 ) , suggesting that Pol II serves as a sort of “ molecular glue ” stabilizing TF clustering at enhancers . Im - portantly , purification of optogenetically induced TF clusters revealed that they form a macromolecular activator complex containing Mediator and Pol II constituents ( 10 ) . A recent live - imaging study suggested that TF clusters are typically formed ~ 40 s before the induction of transcriptional bursting , and this time lag becomes much less pronounced ( ~ 8 s ) when Mediator clus - ters were visualized instead of TFs ( 5 ) , sug - gesting that there is a temporal hierarchy between the clustering of TFs , Mediator , and Pol II at enhancers ( Fig . 1B ) . Overall , the recent literature is consistent with the idea that enhancers serve as hubs for the transient assembly of TF clusters and Pol II / Mediator during induction of transcrip - tional bursting . It is likely that simultaneous live visualization of TF clustering together with Pol II / Mediator dynamics in living cells will provide further mechanistic in - sights into the regulatory process of tran - scriptional bursting .
