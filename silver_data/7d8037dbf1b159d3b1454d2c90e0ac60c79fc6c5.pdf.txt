Neurobiology of Disease Hydrodynamic Cellular Volume Changes Enable Glioma Cell Invasion Stacey Watkins and Harald Sontheimer Department of Neurobiology , Center for Glial Biology in Medicine , University of Alabama at Birmingham , Birmingham , Alabama 35294 Malignant gliomas are highly invasive brain tumors that currently lack effective treatment . Unlike other cancers , gliomas do not metas - tasize via the vasculature but invade surrounding brain solely along extracellular routes , primarily moving along the vasculature and nerve tracts . This study uses several model systems to visualize and quantitatively assess cell volume changes of human glioma cells invading within the brain’s extracellular space of C . B . 17 severe combined immunodeficient ( scid ) mice and tumor cells invading in a modified Boyden chamber using three - dimensional multiphoton and confocal time - lapse microscopy . Regardless of model system used to quantitatively assess volume changes , invading glioma cells maximally decreased their volume by 30 – 35 % , a value that was indepen - dent of barrier and cell size . Through osmotic challenges , we demonstrate that the observed cellular volume changes during invasion represent the smallest achievable cell volume and require glioma cells to release all free unbound cytoplasmic water . Water osmotically follows the release of Cl (cid:1) through ion channels and cotransporters and blockade of Cl (cid:1) flux inhibits both volume changes and cell invasion . Hence , invadinggliomacellsusehydrodynamicvolumechangestomeetthespatialconstraintsimposedwithinthebrain , using essentially all free , unbound cytoplasmic water to maximally alter their volume as they invade . Introduction Glial - derived tumors , also known as gliomas , have limited treat - ment options and carry a dismal prognosis with median patient survival time of 12 months from diagnosis ( Krex et al . , 2007 ) . Notoriously , gliomas invade into surrounding brain tissue , lim - iting successful surgical resection and increasing recurrence ( Giese et al . , 1994 ) . The capacity of gliomas to infiltrate the brain has been extensively studied , emphasizing intercellular interac - tions and the invading cell’s ability to degrade the extracellular matrix ( Berens et al . , 1994 ; Giese et al . , 1994 ; Tysnes et al . , 1996 ; Ohnishi et al . , 1997 ; Belie¨n et al . , 1999 ; Demuth and Berens , 2004 ) . Rather than spreading hematogenously , as is common among tumors , glioma cells migrate along white matter tracks or use the vasculature’s abluminal surface as a conduit ( Rutka et al . , 1988 ; Pedersen et al . , 1995 ) . It is unclear how the physical con - straints of extracellular spaces affect invading cells . Electron mi - crographic images portray invading glioma cells as elongated , slender wedge - shaped ( Soroceanu et al . , 1999 ) , consistent with cell volume reduction . Volume changes may permit cells to adapt to environmental spatial constraints , yet alternatively cells may undergo shape changes while maintaining a constant volume . Therefore , one principal objective of this study was to determine whethercellinvasionisintrinsicallyassociatedwithandmayevenrequirechangesinoverallcellvolume . Previous studies suggest that cell volume changes that occur as a result of osmotic changes use K (cid:2) and Cl (cid:1) ions . These ions flux via channels and transporters along with obligated water to rees - tablish the normal cellular volume ( Sontheimer , 2008 ) . Putative K (cid:2) and Cl (cid:1) channels that engage in volume changes of glioma cells have been identified through molecular cloning and bio - physical studies . These channels include gBK , a Ca 2 (cid:2) - activated K (cid:2) channel , and ClC - 2 and ClC - 3 , voltage - gated Cl (cid:1) channels ( Liu et al . , 2002 ; Olsen et al . , 2003 ) . However , it unknown whether spontaneously occurring volume changes of invading cells are similarly accompanied by ion flux , yet indirect evidence using pharmacological inhibition or experimental downregula - tionofchannelexpressionwithshRNAsuggeststhistobethecase ( Soroceanu et al . , 1999 ; Ransom et al . , 2001 ; McFerrin and Sontheimer , 2006 ; Weaver et al . , 2006 ; Habela et al . , 2009 ; Cud - dapah and Sontheimer , 2010 ; Lui et al . , 2010 ) . Hence in this study , we set out to examine whether glioma cells modulate their cell volume during invasion through extra - cellular spaces in the living brain , in brain tissue , or in artificial barrier membranes . We asked whether cell volume changes are necessary for cell invasion and , if so , whether these are mediated by the coordinated flux of ions acting as osmolytes . Using quan - titative three - dimensional multiphoton and confocal time - lapse microscopy , we imaged cell invasion in vivo , in situ , and in vitro . We show that in each condition , invading glioma cells decreased their volume by 30 – 35 % , regardless of their starting volume or the size of the barrier encountered . These values resembled the maximally achievable cellular volume decrease as determined ReceivedAug . 1 , 2011 ; revisedSept . 27 , 2011 ; acceptedOct . 14 , 2011 . Authorcontributions : H .

In vivo invasion / migration assay . Experiments were performed in ac - cordance with the University of Alabama Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee . Six - to 12 - week - old C . B . - 17 scid mice of either sex were anesthetized by 2 – 5 % isoflurane . A midline scalp incision was cut fol - lowed by a 0 . 5 mm burr hole 1 . 0 – 2 . 0 mm to the left or right of the midline in the frontal brain . D54 - EGFP tumor cells ( 1 . 25 – 5 . 0 (cid:3) 10 5 ) in methylcellulose were stereotactically injected 1 . 5 – 2 . 0 mm deep via a 250 (cid:1) lHamiltonsyringewitha30gaugeneedle ( BDBiosciences ) mountedin a Stoelting stereotaxic apparatus . The incision was closed using skin glue and mice recovered for 2 – 3 weeks to allow tumor growth . Three to 5 d before imaging studies , animals had an 8 - mm - diameter cranial glass window placed over the area of tumor implantation with a metal immo - bilization bar placed on the anterior skull , following a previously de - scribed protocol ( Holtmaat et al . , 2009 ) . On the day of imaging , tail vein injections of 300 (cid:1) l of 5 mg / ml 70 , 000 molecular weight tetramethylrho - daminedextran ( Invitrogen ) wereadministered . Forimaging , theanimal was mounted via the immobilization bar under the microscope . Cells migrating away from the tumor mass were imaged for 3 – 4 h periods using a multiphoton laser scanning fluorescence microscope ( Prairie Technologies ) equipped with a (cid:3) 60 / 0 . 90 W water - immersion objective ( Olympus ) . Image analysis was performed using Imaris 6 . 15 Software ( Bitplane Scientific Software ) and volume measurements were obtained by reconstruction analysis using Image Pro 3D Suite software ( Media Cybernetics ) . Individual cell volume changes were calculated relative to each cell’s maximum volume measured and then averaged . Ex vivo invasion / migration assay . Tumor implantation surgeries were doneasmentionedaboveusingD54 - EGFPandU251 - EGFPcells . Onthe day of the experiment , mice were anesthetized by injection of (cid:4) 100 (cid:1) l of a ketamine / xylazine mixture ( 25 mg / ml each ) . Careful dissection of the thoracic cavity was performed to visualize the heart . Two hundred to 400 (cid:1) l of 5 mg / ml 2 , 000 , 000 molecular weight tetramethylrhodamine dex - tran solution ( Invitrogen ) was intracardially injected and allowed to circulate . Following this , a rapid craniotomy was executed with the cer - ebellum removed and discarded . The brain was then placed in ice - cold artificial CSF ( ACSF ) ( 120 . 0 m M NaCl , 3 . 0 m M KCl , 1 . 0 m M MgCl 2 , 26 . 2 m M NaHCO 3 , 11 . 1 m M glucose , and 5 . 0 m M HEPES ) oxygenated with 95 % O 2 / 5 % CO 2 to maintain pH at 7 . 4 . Three - hundred - micrometer coronal slices were cut and allowed to recover for 0 . 5 – 1 . 5 h at room temperature in oxygenated ACSF supplemented with 0 . 1 % FBS and 2 m M CaCl 2 . Individual slices were placed in a heated chamber and under constant perfusion of oxygenated ACSF supplemented with CaCl 2 and FBS . Invading tumor cells were imaged for 3 – 4 h using an Olympus Fluoview 300 laser scanning microscope ( LSM ) with a (cid:3) 60 / 0 . 90 W water - immersion lens . EGFP was excited by an argon laser ( excitation 488 nm ) , and the rhodamine dextran was excited by a helium laser ( ex - citation 555 ) . Z - stacks consisting of 100 – 400 optical sections 800 nm apart were acquired every 15 – 20 min . Volume measurements were made using Image Pro 3D Suite software and individual cell volume changes were calculated relative to each cell’s maximum volume measured and then averaged . In situ invasion / migration assay . Staining of the vasculature and prep - aration of acute brain slices were performed as described above . After recovering at room temperature for 0 . 5 – 1 . 5 h , slices were transferred to an incubator maintaining them at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 for 0 . 5 – 1 . 0 h . D54 - EGFPorU251 - EGFPcellswereresuspendedinACSFsupplementedwith FBS and CaCl 2 . Seventy thousand to 100 , 000 cells were seeded onto the surface of the acute brain slice and allowed to invade for 0 . 5 – 1 . 5 h before being transferred to the heated chamber on the microscope . Tumor cells adherent to blood vessels were imaged as in the ex vivo invasion assay . In the studies using application of chloride channel and cotransporter in - hibitors , stockdrugsolutionsweredilutedintoACSFsupplementedwith FBS and CaCl 2 after individual cells adherent to blood vessels were identified . Transwell migration assays . Cell culture filter inserts ( 8 . 0 (cid:1) m pores ) werecoatedonthelowersurfacewith3 (cid:1) g / mlvitronectininPBSat37°C , 10 % CO 2 overnight . FourhundredmicrolitersofMABwereaddedtothe lower chamber . Forty thousand D54 - EGFP cells in MAB were seeded in the top chamber for 30 min to allow for adherence to the filter’s mem - brane . Drugs were added to the lower chamber and returned to 37°C , 10 % CO 2 for 3 . 5 h . To assay the percentage of cells migrating as a func - tion of time , cells on the lower filter surface were fixed and stained with crystal violet for nuclei visualization and counting . The cells remaining on the top of the filters were wiped away . For each filter , five fields of view were imaged using a 20 (cid:3) objective on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope . Migrated cells were counted using ImageJ ( NIH Image , NIH ) . For imaging of cell migration across the Transwell barrier , 10 , 000 cells D54 - EGFP or U251 - EGFP cells were seeded in 8 . 0 (cid:1) m pore cell culture filter inserts ( BD Biosciences ) , coated on the bottom with 3 (cid:1) g / ml vitro - nectin .

Warm3 % agarinPBSwasaddedtofurthersecure the insert if necessary . A prewarmed solution of 17 % serum - containing media and 10 ng / ml EGF was poured into the chamber to completely surround the insert and cover the entire membrane’s surface . The cham - ber was maintained at 37°C and 10 % CO 2 . Cells were imaged with a Olympus Fluoview 300 LSM using a 60 (cid:3) / 0 . 90 W water - immersion lens following individual cells migrating from one side of the membrane to the other . Z - stacks consisting of 50 – 120 optical sections 800 nm apart were acquired every 15 – 25 min . Volume measurements were generated using Image Pro 3D Suite software and individual cell volume changes were calculated relative to each cell’s maximum volume measured and then averaged . These experiments were repeated with 3 . 0 (cid:1) m ( BD Bio - sciences ) and 5 . 0 (cid:1) m cell culture filter inserts ( Millipore ) with slight modificationtotheprotocolabove : vitronectinwasnotcoatedonthetop surface of the filter before seeding the cells on the top of the membrane’s surface .

Hyperosmotic challenges during in situ invasion / migration assay . The in situ invasion assay was repeated as previously described using D54 - EGFP . Once cells had invaded the tissue , a single Z - stack was acquired consisting of 50 – 200 optical sections 800 nm apart . Following this , the ACSF supplemented with CaCl 2 perfusing the slice was exchanged for ACSF supplemented with CaCl 2 containing increasing amounts of man - nitol .

Results Dynamic volume changes accompany cell invasion in vivo A key question of this study was whether glioma cells undergo cell volume changes as they move through narrow extracellular brain spaces . Volume changes may allow cells to adapt to spatial con - strictions in their environment ; however , cells may undergo rather pronounced shape changes while maintaining a constant volume . Our first approach was to measure volume changes oc - curring as glioma cell invade the brain of a living mouse , taking advantage of multiphoton LSM . EGFP - expressing human glioma cells ( D54 - EGFP cells ) , derived from a WHO grade IV glioma ( Bigner et al . , 1981 ) , were stereotactically implanted into the ce - rebrum of scid mice and allowed to proliferate and invade brain tissue for 2 – 4 weeks . A cranial glass window was then positioned over the area of implantation . Rhodamine dextran dye was in - jected into the tail vein , resulting in a clear outline of the vascu - lature including fine branches . A representative image ( Fig . 1 A ) shows significant tumor burden associated with the vasculature , and under higher magnification , single migratory cells could be identified ( Fig . 1 B ) . Individual cells were imaged for 3 – 4 h , the duration of the anesthesia , acquiring Z - stacks consisting of 100 – 400 optical sections 400 nm apart every 15 min . The resulting image stacks were rendered in three dimensions ( 3D ) for volume and velocity determination using ImagePro software . Invasion / migration speed ranged from 6 . 50 to 13 . 25 (cid:1) m / h . Figure 1 C shows cell volumes as a function of time for two representative cells , which exhibited significant cell volume fluctuations . Aver - age volume change observed in four migrating glioma cells in vivo was of 32 . 41 (cid:5) 1 . 61 % . Glioma cells invading / migrating along vasculature in situ undergo dynamic volume changes To complement the above studies , we next asked whether similar volume changes can be observed in acute brain slices that are more amendable to experimental manipulation . For the first se - ries of studies , we isolated 300 (cid:1) m acute brain slices from the tumor bearing scid mice described above , implanted with either D54 - EGFP or U251 - EGFP human glioma cells . Akin to the in vivo studies , the vasculature was labeled by rhodamine dextran delivered via intracardiac injection . This facilitated the identifi - cation of tumor cells adherent to blood vessels . Volume measure - ments were made from individual cells as they migrated along the vasculature over a time period of 3 – 4 h . Volume changes in tu - mor cells from animals xenografted with D54 - EGFP and U251 - EGFP human glioma cells were 30 . 71 (cid:5) 1 . 28 % ( n (cid:6) 7 ) and 29 . 97 (cid:5) 1 . 98 % ( n (cid:6) 11 ) , respectively , values remarkably similar to those observed in vivo . Figure 2 A displays still - frame images taken at three different time points for representative D54 - EGFP glioma cells migrating along blood vessels over a 4 h time period . Quantitative assessment of volume changes that accompanied the cell’s movement are plotted in Figure 2 B . In a second invasion model system , we seeded D54 - EGFP or U251 - EGFP human glioma cells on the surface of freshly sec - tioned 300 (cid:1) m scid mouse brain slices and allowed cells to invade into the tissue ( Soroceanu et al . , 1999 ; Montana and Sontheimer , 2011 ) . Cells rapidly attached to blood vessels and were imaged over a period of 2 – 4 h . Figure 2 C shows a series of still frames of a representative D54 - EGFP cell found adherent to a blood vessel atthreedifferenttimepoints . Overtimethecelltraveledfromone vasculature bifurcation to another , extending a cellular process forward followed by retracting its posterior end . Figure 2 D show the corresponding volume fluctuations for this glioma cell , ana - lyzed as described above . Cell volume measurements of addi - tional cells demonstrated averages of 33 . 13 (cid:5) 4 . 08 % ( n (cid:6) 7 ) and 30 . 84 (cid:5) 1 . 78 % ( n (cid:6) 6 ) volume changes in D54 - EGFP and U251 - EGFP cells , respectively . Volume changes for each model system are summarized in Figure 2 E . Since we hypothesize that the observed volume changes are intrinsically linked to glioma cell invasion and migration , includ - ing process extension and retraction , “sedentary” cells that nei - ther move nor extend processes should not show equal volume changes . Indeed , sedentary glioma cells showed significantly smaller volume fluctuations ( 17 . 10 (cid:5) 1 . 23 % in 11 D54 - EGFP cells and 16 . 17 (cid:5) 1 . 42 % in 5 U251 - EGFP cells , p (cid:6) 0 . 0007 and p (cid:6) 0 . 0002 , respectively , comparing invading versus sedentary cells , two - tailed unpaired t test ) . Maximal volume changes are independent of barrier or cell size The above - described invasion assays are used to model the human disease . However , they do not allow the visualization of physical barriers and constraints encountered by invading cells . To determine whether volume changes occur in concert with cell process extension or whether they relate to cells ad - justing to the physical barriers encountered , we adopted a 3D invasion assay that permits imaging the invasion of cells through a barrier of a defined size . This modified Transwell ( Boyden ) invasion / migration chamber ( Fig . 3 A ) was main - Figure1 . Invading / migratinggliomacellsfrommicebearingxenografttumorsundergodynamicvolumechanges .

Image stacks of 50 – 150 sections at 800 nm were used for 3D rendering and quantitative volume analysis . Fig - ure 3 B shows multiple cells traversing pores at various stages . Figure 3 C shows a representative series of 3D renderings with volume projections over 4 h for an individual glioma cell ex - tending its process through an 8 . 0 (cid:1) m pore in the Transwell insert , gradually traversing through the pore from one side of the membrane onto the opposite side . Chemotactic movement was initiated by presenting EGF and serum - containing media on the opposite side of the membrane , and cells moved against gravity from the bottom of the chamber to the top . These image series allowed us to assess the cell’s volume with regard to the stage of invasion , i . e . , the degree to which the cell had traversed the barrier . We analyzed Transwell migration for 27 glioma cells and two different cell types , D54 - EGFP ( n (cid:6) 19 ) and U251 - EGFP ( n (cid:6) 8 ) cells , which did not differ significantly in their overall behavior ( p (cid:6) 0 . 4418 , two - tailed unpaired t test ) , yielding average volume changes of 32 . 21 (cid:5) 2 . 13 % for D54 - EGFPand29 . 43 (cid:5) 2 . 03 % fortheU251 - EGFPgliomacells . There - fore , we used D54 - EGFP cells for the remaining experiments . A universal pattern of volume changes emerged whereby cells un - derwent an initial cell volume decrease , reaching a minimum when cells appeared to be approximately halfway through the pore , resembling a dumbbell in the 3D rendering ( Fig . 4 A , inset ) , followed by a gradual volume increase as the cell completed mi - gration through the pore ( Fig . 4 A ) . To illustrate that this was shared by all cells , we determined the relative percentage of the cell that had migrated through the Transwell filter at the lowest recorded cell volume for each cell ( Fig . 4 B ) . This value was 51 . 32 (cid:5) 7 . 21 % , suggesting that on average the lowest volume was recorded with approximately half of the cell on each side of the membrane ( Fig . 4 B , p (cid:6) 0 . 7972 , two - tailed unpaired t test ) . The maximal rate of volume decrease , 53 . 54 (cid:5) 7 . 58 fl / min , observed as the cell approaches its minimum , and the ensuing volume increase , 58 . 77 (cid:5) 7 . 61 fl / min , are not signif - icantly different ( p (cid:6) 0 . 6294 , two - tailed unpaired t test ) , sug - gesting that cells increase and decrease their volume at equivalent rates . The velocity during the process of volume decrease , as the cell crossed the barrier’s membrane , ranged from 2 . 40 to 57 . 60 (cid:1) m / h with an average of 18 . 00 (cid:5) 3 . 13 (cid:1) m / h . Regression analysis suggested that velocity was not cor - related with the rate of volume decrease ( data not shown , y (cid:6) (cid:1) 17 . 587 x (cid:2) 2653 . 3 , R 2 (cid:6) 0 . 01277 , R (cid:6) (cid:1) 0 . 1130 ) .

The size / volume of individual cells in these assays varied con - siderably from cell to cell . Therefore , we questioned whether the degree of the volume change that a cell undergoes during invasion correlated with its maximal volume . Figure 4 E shows a linear rela - tionship between the maximum total cell volume and the change in thetotalcellvolumeofinvadingcells ( Fig . 4 E , y (cid:6) 0 . 3365 x (cid:1) 111 . 93 , R 2 (cid:6) 0 . 7366 , R (cid:6) 0 . 8583 ) , suggestingthatlargecellsrequirepropor - tionally larger volume changes for invasion . An important question was whether the volume change was dictated by the barrier size . Surprisingly , there was no significant difference in the mean cell volume of cells migrating through 5 . 0 (cid:1) m as compared to 8 . 0 (cid:1) m pores with values of 32 . 89 (cid:5) 2 . 65 % and 32 . 21 (cid:5) 2 . 13 % % , respectively ( Fig . 4 F , p (cid:6) 0 . 8633 , two - tailed unpaired t test ) . Smaller 3 . 0 (cid:1) m pores prevented migration in all but one of 145 cells , and the one cell changed its volume by 33 . 04 % . Invading glioma cells approach a minimum achievable volume as they invade in situ A cell’s interior consists of the cytoskeleton and organelles , such as the nucleus , mitochondria , endoplasmic reticulum , and Golgi , along with the cytoplasm , which is a mixture of water , ions , and small organic molecules . The relative contribution of cytoplasmic water to the cellular content varies from cell to cell but is generally be - lieved to be (cid:4) 50 % . Of the cytoplasm , not all is freely diffusible , but up to 50 % is bound by proteins , nucleic acids , and sur - faces of organelles ( Clegg , 1984b ) . Any rapid decrease in cell volume requires cy - tosol to leave the cell , most likely in the form of ions or osmolytes being released with cytosolic “free” water to follow . The above observed 30 – 35 % volume decrease observed in invading cells may resemble the available “cytoplasmic free water space” that a cell can lose while staying viable . To test this hypothesis , we determined the maximal decrease in cell volume pos - sible through hyperosmotic challenges . Like most cells , glioma cells attempt to maintain a constant cell volume when hy - perosmotically challenged through a pro - cess called regulatory volume increase ( RVI ) ( Ernest and Sontheimer , 2007 ; Mc - Coy and Sontheimer , 2007 ; Haas and Sontheimer , 2010 ) , but in gliomas , RVI can be inhibited by removal of glutamine from the medium ( Ernest and Sontheimer , 2007 ) . Invading glioma cells in brain slices were exposed to step - like increases in osmolarity ranging from nor - mal 300 mOsmol to 1200 mOsmol ( in the absence of glutamine to inhibit RVI ) , and the total cell volume was determined by 3D image reconstruction in situ . These ex - periments were done in cells actively in - vading the brain and hence completely embedded in a brain slice environment and fully adherent to extracellular matrix and surrounding cells . Representative im - ages are shown in Figure 5 A for three different osmolarities . Figure 5 B compares the total volume changes that occur when glioma cells were subjected to a series of osmotic challenges to the volume changes expected if the cells mimicked perfect osmometers . Close examination of total volume changes revealed that gli - oma cells appear to behave like perfect osmometers ( expected volume ) up to a cell volume (cid:4) 65 % , i . e . , up to a 35 % volume decrease . Any larger challenges caused cell volume changes that deviated considerably from ideal , eventually plateauing at close to 50 % . For example , when exposed to a 900 mOsm challenge of mannitol , i . e . a final osmolarity of 1200 mOsm , the total cell volumedecreased49 . 25 (cid:5) 5 . 76 % , dramaticallydifferentfromthe expected 75 % cell volume change . The inability to undergo con - densation beyond 50 % of the measured baseline volume suggests that all available cytoplasmic water had been secreted from the cells , and the remaining volume appears to be occupied by sta - tionary organelles and / or bound water . These studies provide an extreme and unphysiological lower limit for the total nuclear and cell size as being (cid:4) 50 % of normal . The deviation from behaving like an osmometer at (cid:4) 65 % sug - gests that with any changes exceeding 35 % , free diffusion of water no longer suffices and that the cell poses a force to prevent low - ering the cell’s volume . Interestingly , an unrelated study with the same cells found that a reduction in overall cell volume to (cid:7) 65 % Figure5 . Minimalachievablecellvolume .

WatkinsandSontheimer • VolumeChangesEnableGliomaCellInvasion J . Neurosci . , November23 , 2011 • 31 ( 47 ) : 17250 – 17259 • 17255 of its original cell volume for extended pe - riods of time is sufficient to activate caspase - 3 , thereby inducing apoptosis ( Ernest et al . , 2008 ) . Our interpretation of these studies is that the total water content of glioma cells is (cid:4) 50 % of their total volume , yet the free water space is (cid:4) 35 % . This value is close to the 30 – 33 % volume change occurring in invading cells , suggesting that invading cells use essentially all of the free water when they invade . Chloride provides the energetic driving force for cell volume reduction during invasion Previous studies have suggested that gli - oma cell shrinkage is due to channel - or transporter - mediated Cl (cid:1) efflux driving water out of the cells ( Ernest et al . , 2005 ) . To determine whether this applies for the here - observed volume changes , the in vitro and in situ invasion / migration assays were repeated in the presence of chloride channel and transport inhibitors . The available pharmacologic inhibitors lack specificity , and our experiments merely assess the requirement for Cl (cid:1) flux to ac - complish volume changes in invading cells . NPPB ( 200 (cid:1) M ) and Cd 2 (cid:2) ( 250 (cid:1) M ) were used to block Cl (cid:1) flux through chlo - ride channels , DIOA ( 40 (cid:1) M ) was used to inhibit K (cid:2) and Cl (cid:1) flux through KCl cotransporters . The concentrations used have previously been shown to signifi - cantly inhibit volume regulation in gli - oma cells ( Ernest et al . , 2005 ) , and the drug mixture yielded a reduction in Transwell migration by 62 . 51 (cid:5) 11 . 64 % compared to vehicle conditions ( p (cid:6) 0 . 0223 , two - tailed unpaired t test , Fig . 6 A ) . Next we imaged volume changes of cells that already extended a process through a Transwell pore and acutely received the drug mixture . Image stacks and 3D rendering as described above yielded maximum volume changes of 10 . 78 (cid:5) 0 . 41 % ( n (cid:6) 30 ) , significantly different from the 32 . 21 (cid:5) 2 . 13 % ( n (cid:6) 19 ) volume change seen in glioma cells that successfully traversed 8 . 0 (cid:1) m pores ( Fig . 6 C , p (cid:7) 0 . 001 , two - tailed unpaired t test ) . Interest - ingly , these volume changes are similar to those measured in the sedentary cells , suggesting that Cl (cid:1) flux is required to achieve volume changes needed to support cell invasion . Volume change over 4 h fluctuated randomly by approximately (cid:5) 5 % around the median cell volume measured ( Fig . 6 B ) . We repeated these studies imaging migration of glioma cells adherent to the vasculature in situ . The mixture of channel inhib - itors prevented translocation along the blood vessel while simul - taneously arresting the volume changes as illustrated for a representativecellinFigure6 D showingalackoflocomotionand cell volume and shape changes . Specifically , cells exposed to the mixture of inhibitors demonstrated maximal volume changes of 19 . 97 (cid:5) 2 . 31 % ( n (cid:6) 5 ) , significantly different from the 33 . 13 (cid:5) 4 . 08 % ( n (cid:6) 7 ) observed in invading cells and similar to the 17 . 10 (cid:5) 1 . 23 % ( n (cid:6) 11 ) seen in sedentary cells ( Fig . 6 E , p (cid:7) 0 . 001 , Tukey – Kramer multiple - comparisons test ) . These studies further suggestthatthevolumechangesassociatedwithinvasionandmigra - tion are due to the osmotic movement of water initiated by the movement of ions . Discussion Using quantitative time - lapse 3D imaging , this study provides the first in vivo evidence that invading glioma cells modulate their volume as they invade the brain . Cells imaged while crossing Transwell barriers show a volume decrease by (cid:4) 30 – 35 % , and this value was independent of cell size or the barrier size encoun - tered . Additional experiments suggest that the observed 30 – 35 % volume decrease represents the smallest readily achievable cell volume . This requires cells to release essentially all unbound cy - toplasmic water and involved the coordinated efflux of Cl (cid:1) and K (cid:2) ions along with obliged cytoplasmic water . All volume measurements were derived from time - lapse 3D multiphoton and confocal imaging of EGFP - expressing cells al - lowing rendition of cells in 3D . The EGFP label was constitutively expressed and hence fluorescent intensities did not vary over the time course of the experiments , minimizing potential errors as - sociated with thresholding cell boundaries .

Pharmacolog - ical inhibition of Cl (cid:1) channels not only inhibited cell invasion but also reduced volume changes to a comparable level observed in stationary cells , proposing that volume changes are mechanis - tically tied to cell invasion . Cell migration is a complex and multifactorial process in which the here - observed volume changes work in concert with otherwelldescribedaspectsofcellinvasion . Mostnotably , invad - ing gliomas interact with ECM proteins via a variety of cell adhesion molecules ( Merzak et al . , 1994 ; Owens et al . , 1998 ; Nakada et al . , 2007 ; Kohutek et al . , 2009 ) and release matrix - metalloproteinases ( Lakka et al . , 2002 ; Nakada et al . , 2007 ) to degrade the extracellular matrix . Actin - myosin molecular mo - tors propel cells as focal adhesion sites attach and detach cel - lular processes in a highly regulated manner ( Abbas and Whitfield , 2009 ) . Given the spatial constraints that migrating cells encounter in brain , the observed volume changes were not unexpected , yet we were surprised that the magnitude of the volume changes invari - ably converged on a value of 30 – 35 % , regardless of the model system examined and independent of the cell size and the barrier size encountered . This led us to hypothesize that this value may represent the lowest readily achievable volume of the cell , re - quiring the release of all unbound cytoplasmic water along with K (cid:2) and Cl (cid:1) . This conclusion is supported by experiments determining volume changes of glioma cells challenged to shrink by exposure to increasing concentrations of mannitol while in - vading in tissue . These osmotically challenged cells behaved like perfect osmometers provided that the hyperosmotic challenge did not force cells to shrink by (cid:8) 35 % , which was the case at an osmolarity of 450 mOsm . For larger challenges ( 600 – 1200 mOsm ) , actual cell volume deviated substantially and lagged be - hind the predicted values . This suggests that up to 35 % of the cell volume is occupied by water that freely diffuses along the osmotic gradient and therefore resembles “free cytoplasmic water . ” Larger osmotic gradients were able to reduce glioma cell volume by an additional 15 % , but required high osmotic pressures since waterwasmostlikelyboundtoproteins , macromolecules , and / or organelles . Previous studies have separated cytoplasmic water into two categories with only a portion exhibiting properties of pure water and the remainder showing properties we describe , including bound water interacting with organelles , cytoskeleton , and other proteins ( Clegg , 1984a , b ) . The absolute lowest limit that glioma cell could reach was (cid:4) 50 % , a value that agrees with a literature suggesting that in most mammalian cell 50 % of the cell volume is occupied by cytoplasm . At this volume , however , cells may no longer be viable . In a previous study , the sustained de - crease of glioma cell volume by (cid:8) 35 % led to apoptotic cell death presumably via the autoactivation of caspase - 3 ( Ernest et al . , 2008 ) . Hence the observed 35 % volume decrease appears to be the maximal physiologically sustainable decrease in glioma cell volume . It is worth mentioning that the smallest barrier that glioma cells were able to traverse was 5 (cid:1) m , and this size limit appears to be imposed by the size of the nucleus , which decreased in volume concomitant with the cytoplasmic volume ( data not shown ) . Finally , we were surprised that the magnitude of the cell volume decrease did not correlate with the barrier size . One may have intuitively assumed that cells adjust their volume propor - tionally to the size of the barrier encountered . Our data instead suggest a possible advantage by extruding all available cytoplas - micwateruponencounteringamechanicalbarrier . Alternatively , the osmotic change inside the cell achieved through the egress of water may create an optimal environment for the motility ma - chinery to operate . The above - described experiments established an osmotic gra - dient to extract all available cytoplasmic water from the cell . In contrast , invading cells initiate the volume decrease by releasing osmotically active ions with obligated cytoplasmic water to fol - low . Consistent with this model , inhibition of Cl (cid:1) efflux through channels and transporters inhibited cell volume decrease and rendered cells unable to migrate across barriers in our studies . The anti - invasive action of Cl (cid:1) channel / transport inhibitors agrees with numerous previous studies in gliomas and other can - cers that have implicated channels and transporters in cell migra - tion ( Schwab , 2001 ; McFerrin and Sontheimer , 2006 ; Mao et al . , 2007 , 2008 ) , where inhibitors of K (cid:2) and Cl (cid:1) channels in partic - ular have been shown to retard cell invasion and migration ( So - roceanu et al . , 1998 , 1999 ; Ransom et al . , 2001 ; Kim et al . , 2004 ; Mao et al . , 2005 , 2009 ; McFerrin and Sontheimer , 2006 ; Weaver et al . , 2006 ) . These and other studies have ascribed a unique role to Cl (cid:1) as an essential osmolyte responsible for the movement of water in and out of the glioma cell ( Wang et al . , 2000 ; Okada and Maeno , 2001 ; Sardini et al . , 2003 ; Ernest et al . , 2005 ) . Consistent with this notion , various Cl (cid:1) channel blockers inhibit migration , a phenomenon observed in a number of different cancers ( Sor - oceanu et al . , 1998 , 1999 ; Shen et al . , 2000 ; Ransom et al . , 2001 ; Mao et al . , 2007 ) . For Cl (cid:1) to function as the energetic driving force for a volume decrease , an outward - directed gradient has to be maintained . In gliomas , the Na (cid:2) / K (cid:2) / 2Cl (cid:1) transporter NKCC1 accumulates Cl (cid:1) to 100 – 140 m M , a concentration that is 10 - fold greater than observed in neurons or many other cells ( Habela et al . , 2009 ) . As a result , the opening of Cl (cid:1) channels is sufficient to lead to cell shrinkage , and persistent opening of Cl (cid:1) channels under these conditions causes a decrease in the cell vol - ume by 35 % ( Habela et al . , 2009 ) , exactly the same value that we report as the maximally achievable volume decrease by invading cells . The presented data support a novel “hydrodynamic” glioma cell invasion model whereby ion flow acts as the energetic driving force governing the movement of cytoplasmic water across the cell membrane . Both the relative distribution of Cl (cid:1) across the membrane and the cytoplasmic free water content ultimately de - termine the dynamic changes in cell volume and the minimal cell size achievable . We hypothesize that other migratory cells , in - cluding immature neurons , glial progenitor cells , microglia , and stem cells may use a similar hydrodynamic mechanism to aid their migration . After all , these cells share many properties with gliomas including a high proliferative potential , self - renewal , and most important to this study , the capacity to migrate . Like glio - mas , glial progenitor cells migrate along white matter nerve tracts or blood vessels , and as they migrate , both cell types assume a similar unipolar morphology , extending a leading process that initiate forward movement ( Cayre et al . , 2009 ) . Additional simi - larities include overlapping cellular signaling through platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) and EGF ( Canoll and Goldman , 2008 ; Cayre et al . , 2009 ) . In light of these biological traits shared between glioma cells and both neural and glial progenitors , hy - drodynamic volume regulation during migration may similarly aid their migration . Consistent with this hypothesis , these cells , like gliomas , accumulate intracellular Cl (cid:1) and maintain an outward - directed gradient for Cl (cid:1) ( Kakazu et al . , 1999 ; Kuner and Augustine , 2000 ; Achilles et al . , 2007 ; Habela et al . , 2009 ) that could be harnessed to decrease the cell’s volume in the same fashion as shown here for gliomas .

We neither show nor imply that these volume changes have an instructive role or are initiating cell movement per se . Future studies shall investigate the interactions of channels that mediate cell volume changes with the cell’s cyto - skeleton and actin - myosin molecular motors and the signaling events involving cell movement . These interactions may open novel avenues for the development of anti - invasive therapeutics in the future .
