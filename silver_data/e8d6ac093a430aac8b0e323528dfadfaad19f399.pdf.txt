The C19 pandemic , which engulfed the world in 2021 , also caused a national C19 epidemic in Pakistan , who responded with initial forced lockdowns ( 15 - 30 March 2020 ) and a subsequent switch to a smart lockdown strategy , and , by 31 December 2020 , Pakistan had managed to limit confirmed cases and case fatalities to 482 , 506 ( 456 per 100 , 000 ) and 10 , 176 ( 4 . 8 per 100 , 000 ) . The early switch to a smart lockdown strategy , and successful follow - up move to central coordination and effective communication and enforcement of Standard Operating Procedures , was motivated by a concern over how broad - based forced lockdowns would affect poor households and day - labour . The current study aims to investigate how the national Pakistan C19 epidemic would have unfolded under an uncontrolled baseline scenario and an alternative set of controlled non - pharmaceutical intervention ( NPI ) policy lockdown scenarios , including health and macroeconomic outcomes . We employ a dynamically - recursive version of the IFPRI Standard Computable General Equilibrium model framework ( Lofgren , Lee Harris and Robinson 2002 ) , and a , by now , well - established epidemiological transmission - dynamic model framework ( Davies , Klepac et al 2020 ) using Pakistan - specific 5 - year age - group contact matrices on four types of contact rates , including at home , at work , at school , and at other locations ( Prem , Cook & Jit 2017 ) , to characterize an uncontrolled spread of disease . Our simulation results indicate that an uncontrolled C19 epidemic , by itself , would have led to a 0 . 12 % reduction in Pakistani GDP ( - 721mn USD ) , and a total of 0 . 65mn critically ill and 1 . 52mn severely ill C19 patients during 2020 - 21 , while 405 , 000 Pakistani citizens would have lost their lives . Since the majority of case fatalities and symptomatic cases , respectively 345 , 000 and 35 . 9mn , would have occurred in 2020 , the case fatality and confirmed case numbers , observed by 31 . December 2020 represents an outcome which is far better than the alternative . Case fatalities by 31 . December 2020 could possibly have been somewhat improved either via a more prolonged one - off 10 week forced lockdown ( 66 % reduction ) or a 1 - month forced lockdown / 2 - months opening intermittent lockdown strategy ( 33 % reduction ) , but both sets of strategies would have carried significant GDP costs in the order of 2 . 2 % - 6 . 2 % of real GDP . .

While other communicable and non - communicable diseases may , in the past , have incurred larger disease burdens , the emergence and rapid spread of the novel Corona virus , SARS - CoV - 2 , and its fellow Corona Virus Disease 2019 or Covid - 19 ( C19 ) , has put the entire world on high alert . The risk of overwhelmed health systems ( at society - level ) , and lack of effective treatments or vaccines , led governments , around the world , to recognize the critical threat to public health , and the need to resort to sometimes draconian non - pharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ) . While many C19 vaccines were developed at break - neck speed , and the recent emergence of effective treatments , in the form of antiretroviral pills , have recently given hope to many around the world , the combination of delays in production and global roll - out of vaccination programmes , and the continued emergence of new and more infectious SARS - CoV - 2 strains in multiple locations , means that complementary NPI restrictions are likely to continue to be needed , for quite some time , in countries around the world , and especially in large and potentially vulnerable low - and middle - income countries ( LMICs ) such as Pakistan . During the first 1½ years , the C19 epicentre has shifted from East Asia to Europe , to North and South America , South Asia , and , more recently , back to Europe . Outside American and European epicentres , most Asian nations fared better , until exponential growth took hold in early 2021 , following a range of super spreader events including religious festivals and political rallies ( Reuters 2021o ) , and the emergence of the new B1617 delta variant of concern ( WHO 2021c , WHO 2021e ) , However , in spite of the severity of India’s massive delta variant corona - wave this year , including 451 , 435 confirmed case fatalities by 14 . October 2021 ( Ritchie 2021 ) and with reports of excess mortality exceeding official numbers by as much as an order of magnitude ( Anand , Sandefur & Subramanian 2021 ) , other populous Asian nations , including Indonesia and , in particular , Pakistan , have , in spite of rising clinical outcomes , been more effective in containing their national epidemics , and , in the case of Pakistan , have , so far , avoided exponential growth and kept trend growth under relative control ( Ritchie 2021 ) . As of 14 October 2021 , Pakistan had recorded 1 , 261 , 685 cases and 28 , 201 case fatalities related to C19 ( Ritchie 2021 ) . In spite of the promise of vaccination programs , which started to be rolled - out globally in December 2020 and early 2021 , access to vaccines at population scale has proven to be an issue for a populous lower - middle - income country like Pakistan . While Pakistan has been assisted by China and , more recently the US , in their clinical C19 - response , and signed - up for UN’s COVAX facility ( VOA 2021 , WHO 2021b ) , and , in spite of being involved in Phase 3 - trials of the Chinese .

December 2020 , of plans to purchase 1 . 2mn doses of the Chinese Sinopharm BBIBP - CorV vaccine ( Reuters 2020a ) and followed by slow public roll - out due to worries , among prioritized healthcare workers ( HCWs ) , about the efficacy and safety of BBIBP - CorV ( HPW 2021 ) ; And , while the first COVAX - vaccine delivery of 1 . 2mn was received on 8 May 2021 ( Reuters 2021l ) . A Gallup Pakistan poll from November 2020 further suggested vaccine scepticism is high , and that as many as 37 % of Pakistanis may not want to get a vaccine once one becomes available ( Reuters 2020b ) . In spite of more recent success in accessing vaccine deliveries and handling vaccine roll - out , with 50mn vaccine doses delivered on 28 August ( DAWN 2021e ) , and 100mn doses delivered on 24 October 2021 ( DAWN 2021f ) , Pakistani authorities will therefore , most likely , need to make controlled achievement of herd immunity a medium - to - long - term policy goal , also because many Pakistanis do not come in for their second booster jab ( DAWN 2021g ) and because signs were starting to emerge , in November 2021 , of problems in reaching remote rural citizens without formal forms of identification ( DAWN 2021h ) . In the meantime , NPIs will need to remain a corner - stone of Pakistani C19 epidemic control due to the threat of new variants , underscored by the experience of the March - May SL lockdown period , following B117 alpha variant spreading and becoming dominant throughout Pakistan in May 2021 ( Reuters 2021m ) 1 and covering the Eid ul Fitr holidays in May ( DAWN 2021d ) , and the July - September SL lockdown , during the Eid ul Azha and Pakistan independence Day holidays and following B1617 delta variant simultaneously being reported dominant in Karachi / Sindh on 15 July ( DAWN 2021i ) and in Lahore / Punjab on 17 July ( DAWN 2021j ) . Lockdowns have been instituted four times , in Pakistan , over the past year , including March - May and November - December 2020 , and March - May and July - September 2021 . The spring 2020 lockdown included : ( 1 ) Phase 1 : Forced lockdown ( FL ) period ( 15 - 30 . March 2020 ) , ( 2 ) Phase 2 : Partial Lockdown ( PL ) period ( 31 . March – 5 . April 2020 ) , and ( 3 ) Phase 3 : Smart Lockdown ( SL ) period ( 6 - 15 . April 2020 ) ( Rukh , Nafees & Khan 2020 ) . The Pakistani authorities quickly decided against FL - style NPIs , in favour of SL - style NPIs , striking a balance between “Standard Operating Procedure ” ( SOP ) information campaigns , and alternative SL - style measures such as tele - schooling and one - day - a - week / two - day - a - week business lockdowns , limited to virus hotspots , and only under exceptional circumstances , general bans on public rallies , gatherings , and indoor weddings , and 1 Throughout January - February 2021 , WHO reported no community transmission of B117 ( WHO 2021d ) , which is surprising given that it emerged as the dominant strain in Punjabi urban centres including the metropolis of Lahore in early - March 2021 ( SAMAA 2021 ) . .

Nationwide lockdown has been vehemently resisted by federal authorities as evidence by federal resistance to a 10 - day general lockdown of Sindh province including the Karachi – referred to Pakistani politicians as the “country’s economic lifeline” ( DAWN 2021k ) . The aim of the Pakistani SL - style NPI measures has been to reduce human activity and contact numbers , and more recently to provide incentives for getting immunized , on the one hand , and to minimize income and poverty impacts on the other , but no assessment has so far been made of the relative economic costs and health benefits of implementing alternative FL - style NPI strategies in Pakistan . This study aims to fill this gap by constructing and applying a Pakistan Computable General Equilibrium ( CGE ) model , based on the “Standard model” framework ( Löfgren , Lee Harris & Robinson 2002 ) , with province - level households , to assess the relative economic costs and health benefits of pursuing alternative one - off and intermittent FL - style NPI strategies , in Pakistan , and thereby provide a backdrop , for Pakistani policymakers , to assess the relative merits and relative success of their preferred SL - style strategy , and to provide an upper bound of the potential value of vaccine roll - out to Pakistani society as measured by the GDP cost of alternative FL - style NPI control strategies . Epidemiological scenarios are simulated using a state - of - the - art C19 epidemiological model for Pakistan ( Pearson et al . 2020 ; Davies , Klepac et al . 2020b ) . The rest of the paper is organized as follows : The Background section will discuss Pakistan ’s C19 epidemic ( s ) , both at the national and provincial levels , and put Pakistan’s experiences with C19 into regional and global context ; The Methods section will present our combined methodological framework for epidemiological and macroeconomic modelling of C19 , and also present our uncontrolled C19 baseline scenario and our three NPI - focussed policy scenarios ; The following Results section will present and interpret our results and put them into a Pakistan context ; And the Conclusion and Discussion section will highlight our main conclusions , and discuss caveats to our results and avenues for future work . .

Disease background C19 is a respiratory illness which is caused by SARS - CoV - 2 , and which spreads via facial droplets or via contact between hands / objects and the face . The basic reproduction number ( R0 ) has generally been considered to be high ( ≈ 2 . 5 - 3 . 5 ) . Whilst Pakistan - specific estimates initially indicated that it may ‘only’ have been around 1 . 6 - 1 . 9 ( Uddin et al 2020 ; Mustafa et al 2020 ; Ali , Imran & Khan 2020 ; Ullah & Khan 2020 ) , this is still twice as infectious as seasonal flu ( R0 around 1 . 4 ) , implying that vaccine - induced herd immunity against the original strain would have required coverage levels of 50 - 60 % with a highly efficacious vaccine ( or > 70 % with efficacy levels around 60 % ) . 2 However , the repeated outbreaks of variants of concern with elevated transmissibility , this year , implies that required coverage levels could well approach 80 % 3 ( or higher with less efficacious vaccines ) , something which could be a matter of serious concern especially in light of reported Pakistani vaccine - scepticism ( Reuters 2020b ) . The morbidity of C19 cases varies from asymptomatic and mild “common cold” - type symptoms , to severe pneumonia , acute respiratory failure , and , for groups - at - risk , high rates of mortality ( Zhou et al 2020 ) . Case fatality rates among unvaccinated population groups range from 1 : 50 , 000 among children at age 10 , and 1 : 10 , 000 among young adults at age 25 , to 1 : 70 among retirees around age 65 , and 1 : 7 among elderly around age 85 ( Levin et al 2020 ) , and , for Pakistani C19 cases requiring hospitalization , illness progression seems to be characterized by an initial asymptomatic stage of approx . 5 days followed , for severe cases , by approx . 8 days of hospitalization in general ward , and , for critical cases , by approx . 10 days of hospitalization , including around 1 / 3 of the time in general ward and 2 / 3 of the time in intensive care , until death or discharge ( Torres - Rueda et al 2020 ) . Evidence has also emerged on long - term health sequelae among recovered C19 cases , referred to as “ Long - COVID” . Among recovered C19 inpatients , critical cases may have significantly increased risks of long - term health sequelae at six months after discharge , including diffusion impairment , 2 Based on the functional relationship between R0 , vaccine efficacy ( ε ) and required coverage rates for herd immunity ( COVER ) , COVER = [ 1 - ( 1 / R0 ) ] / ε ( Anderson et al 2020 ) . 3 The now dominant B117 strain reportedly has 50 - 74 % higher transmissibility ( Davies , Barnard et al 2020 ) , and other variants of concern , including B1351 and P1 , which had been verified in Pakistan in early - May 2021 , ( WHO 2021e ) , reportedly has similarly elevated transmissibility ( Faria et al 2021 ) . .

A small - scale Pakistani study of recovered C19 in - and outpatients confirmed that the majority of cases experienced fatigue , poor sleep quality , anxiety , and dyspnea , almost half experienced a loss of taste and smell regardless of severity of illness , three - quarters of severe cases experienced severe problems in daily activities , and they also found evidence of pulmonary disease even among mild cases ( Iqbal et al 2021 ) . Since these indications about Long - Covid manifestations , and negative health system capacity impacts during peak epidemic periods , are still being studied and mapped , they will not be included in our simulation analyses . National Pakistan disease background 4 Since gaining its independence in 1947 , Pakistan has experienced rapid population growth , but , with declining fertility rates over the recent decade , the end of the demographic transition is finally in sight . Nonetheless , Pakistan still has a fairly young population , with 81 % of the population aged 0 - 39 and 3 . 4 % aged 65 + ( 2019 ) ( GBD 2020 ) . A recent study found the size of the 65 + age group to be a significant predictor of relative C19 caseloads in a cross - section of 182 countries ( Nguiemkeu & Tadedjeu 2021 ) , something which may help explain Pakistan’s relatively low C19 counts , which on 14 October 2021 , included 595 confirmed cases and 13 . 3 case fatalities per 100 , 000 population , as compared with approx . 10 , 000 - 13 , 500 confirmed cases and approx . 180 - 220 case fatalities per 100 , 000 population in other populous countries such as US , Brazil , Mexico 5 , UK , Italy , France , and Spain ( Ritchie 2021 ) . Other factors identified by Nguiemkeu & Tadedjeu as significantly affecting relative C19 caseloads , include demographic and geographic variables such as population density ( + ) , urban population share ( + ) , and temperature ( - ) . In terms of population density , P akistan’s rapid post - independence population growth has increased the population density from 59 . 8 people / km2 in 1961 to 275 . 3 people / km2 in 2018 , a change from being the 84 th to 47 th most densely populated country in the world ( WB 2020 ) . At the same time , disease burdens of major infectious diseases such as TB , HIV / AIDS , and malaria have been trending downwards over recent years ( GBD 2020 ) , indicating that 4 See appendix B for details 5 Mexico had only recorded 2 , 958 confirmed cases per 100 , 000 on 14 . October 2021 . However , the low confirmed case count is likely to be significantly underestimated , as confirmed by the high case fatality numbers ( 224 per 100 , 000 ) which themselves are reported to be underestimated by 60 % ( Reuters 2021h ) . .

In terms of climatic conditions , the climatic variations between Pakistani provinces and territories do not seem to have created systematic variations in C19 - epidemics between the regions of Pakistan . After quickly gaining control over their epidemics during June - July 2020 , the four provinces experienced accelerating transmission in late - October 2020 , suggesting that seasonality , rather than climate , has been the main driver of transmission during 2020 ( Figure 1 ) . Variants of concern , perhaps together with holiday gatherings , have driven the Corona waves during 2021 , but , in spite of upward - sloping regional transmission curves , all provinces and territories have so far , by early - November 2021 , managed to keep their C19 - epidemics under relative control , perhaps with the exception of the urbanized and densely populated ICT , which is showing the highest regional confirmed case count and case fatality rates amounting to respectively 3 , 092 confirmed cases and 28 . 3 deaths per 100 , 000 population per 14 October 2021 ( Table 1 ) , but which was also the first major urban center to report partial resident vaccine coverage of 70 % on 6 September 2021 ( DAWN 2021l ) and 84 % on 18 October 2021 ( DAWN 2021m ) . In the populous Punjab and Sindh provinces , while smart lockdown NPIs are likely to have played a key part in their epidemic containment , the climate may also have favoured out - door activities during at least the first part of the epidemic , until night - time temperatures started dropping below 20C towards end - of - October 2020 . More recently , due to the highly infectious B117 having become dominant throughout Pakistan ( Reuters 2021m ) , 7 - day transmission growth rates ( of confirmed cases ) in KPK and Punjab provinces , and ICT and AJK territories , accelerated from 1 . 9 - 2 . 5 % end - of - February to peak at 7 . 3 % - 8 . 5 % during the week ending 10 April , and subsequently to decelerate to 3 . 4 - 3 . 8 % during the week ending 11 May ( GoP 2021 ) . During the same period , the two remaining provinces , Balochistan and Sindh , and the remaining territory , GB , experienced gradually increasing transmission , implying that all regions experienced relatively constant 7 - day transmission growth rates of 1 . 2 - 3 . 9 % during the week ending 11 May ( ibid . ) While geographically focussed FL - style NPI measures have been employed in Punjab ( DAWN 2021a , 2021b ) , the Pakistan government continued to oppose national lockdowns by end - of - March ( Reuters 2021i ) , but national guidelines on lockdowns has subsequently started to emerge , most recently in relation to the Eid holidays ( DAWN 2021d ) . The reversal of Pakistani policy has come during a period of exponential transmission in neighbouring India ( Figure B . 4 in Appendix B ) – an experience which has made India the new global C19 hotspot , and which has brought the horrors of laissez - faire policy to the attention of the world ( Reuters 2021o ) . .

March , granted emergency use authorisation to at least five vaccines including Sinopharm ’s BBIBP - CorV vaccine ( Reuters 2021c ) , AstraZeneca ’s ChAdOx1 vaccine ( Reuters 2021d ) , Gamaleya’s Gam - COVID - Vac “ Sputnik V ” vaccine ( Reuters 2021e ) , Cansino Bio’ Ad5 - nCoV vaccine ( Reuters 2021f ) , and the Sinovac vaccine ( ET 2021 ) . Interim / final phase 3 trial - evidence has indicated efficacy rates of 92 % for the Gam - COVID - Vac ( Logunov 2021 ) and 62 % for ChAdOx1 ( Voysey et al 2021b ) . No peer - reviewed evidence exists for the remaining vaccines , but news reports suggest efficacy rates of 79 % for BBIBP - CorV ( BioWorld 2020 ) 6 and 51 - 84 % for Sinovac ( Reuters 2021p ) . In terms of efficacy against variants of concern , while no peer - reviewed evidence exists on the efficacy of Gam - COVID - Vac or BBIBP - CorV against the B117 , B1351 , and P1 variants , the evidence - base for ChAdOx1 is more developed . Hence , non - peer - reviewed working paper evidence indicates that ChAdOx1 may be almost as efficacious against B117 - induced C19 as against wildtype - induced C19 ( Emary et al 2021 ) , while peer - reviewed evidence , conversely , suggests that it is not efficacious against the B1351 variant ( Madhi et al 2021 ) . Pakistan’s vaccine roll - out , which started immediately upon receipt of the first batch of BBIBP - CorV on 1 February 2021 , was initially delayed by worries , among prioritized healthcare workers ( HCWs ) , about the efficacy and safety of BBIBP - CorV ( HPW 2021 ) 7 and by delayed COVAX deliveries 8 . In the context of rising B117 transmission , the DRAP , on 4 March , reversed their previous decision and approved BBIBP - CorV and Gam - COVID - Vac for the over - 60s ( NewsInt 2021 ) , paving the way for 6 No peer reviewed studies have so far confirmed the 79 % efficacy level for BBIBP - CorV . 7 The slow roll - out prompted health authorities to post warnings to HCWs , including the Sindh Directorate of Health Services who , in a letter dated 24 February 2021 , warned HCWs that they could face “strict disciplinary action” if they didn’t get vaccinated , but HCWs seem to have remained reluctant ( HPW 2021 ) . 8 Further delays of COVAX deliveries were reported end - of - March 2021 , due to redirection of vaccine deliveries , by Serum Institute of India , in the context of rising Indian transmission ( Reuters 2021j , Reuters 2021k ) . The coming COVAX - related vaccine deliveries , including shipment of 2 . 4mn ChAdOx1 doses in June 2021 , are instead expected to arrive from South Korea ( Reuters 2021n ) . .

March 2021 , the first private imports of 50 , 000 doses of Gam - COVID - Vac vaccines arrived in Pakistan ( Devex 2021 ) , and additional large - scale bulk shipments of Cansino’s Ad5 - nCoV vaccines were expected to arrive in mid - April ( Reuters 2021f , DAWN 2021c ) but had not yet arrived in early - May 2021 . Instead , the Pakistani authorities now expect shipments of 13mn doses of BBIBP - CorV , Ad5 - nCoV , and Sinovac vaccines to arrive before end - of - June ( Reuters 2021n ) . Rega rdless of the Pakistani authorities’ mixed signals , and in spite of their efforts to harness the power of private markets , vaccination roll - out seems likely to be slowed by restricted access to vaccine supplies , and the Pakistani government will therefore , most likely , need to make controlled achievement of herd immunity a medium - to - long - term goal . Macroeconomic modelling background The macroeconomic C19 literature generally focuses on C19 as a health shock with economic repercussions ( 1 ) directly via health - related impacts and ( 2 ) indirectly via private and public mitigating actions . Research into the economics of C19 has , to a large degree , focused more on high - income countries ( HICs ) than on LMICs . However , some comprehensive monographs have emerged covering both global , HIC and LMIC perspectives ( Baldwin & di Mauro 2020 ) , and economists from international institutions have attempted to summarize the limitations which LMICs are facing in terms of structural limitations and potential policy options going forward ( Loaysa & Pennings 2020 ) . A number of macroeconomic studies have emerged which focus on combined epidemiological and macroeconomic modelling of C19 illness and C19 NPI policy shocks . The group of aggregate Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium ( DSGE ) model studies , with endogenous epidemiological models , is focussed on aggregate social planning problems and optimal control strategies . In contrast , single - country and global Computable General Equilibrium ( CGE ) studies , are focussed on more detailed economic burden and NPI policy assessments ; and , for one of the CGE studies ( Keogh - Brown et al .

The group of aggregate DSGE intertemporal model studies employ simple but fully integrated Susceptible - Infected - Recovered SIR - type epidemiological models ( Atkeson 2020a , 2020b ) . They also specify explicit social planning problems and use these to measure optimal lockdown strategies for minimizing macroeconomic and social welfare costs ( Alvarez , Argente & Lippi 2020 ; Eichenbaum , Trebelo & Trabandt 2020 ; Jones , Philippon & Venkateswaran 2020a , 2020b ) . Drawbacks include limited sector - level detail , simple epidemiological model specifications with a typical lack of age - specific heterogeneity of contact patterns and clinical health outcomes , a lack of nuance in specification of lockdown strategies ( typically focusing on the business closure aspect of lockdown strategies ) , and application of widely varying Value of Statistical Life ( VSL ) measures of mortality - related welfare losses ( Alvarez , Argente & Lippi 2020 , Jones , Philippon & Venkateswaran 2020a , 2020b ) . A key strength of the social planning DSGE approach is that it has managed to explicitly model private prevention behaviour , and model two key externalities including ( 1 ) the infection externality ( each individual only focussed on own rather than society protection leading to undersupply of transmission - reducing behavioural change ) , and ( 2 ) the health system congestion externality ( each individual not taking risk of health system congestion into account , again leading to undersupply of transmission - reducing behavioural change ) , and drawing attention to the scope for ( US ) tele - working to mitigate against the need for costly business closure lockdowns ( Jones , Philippon & Venkateswaran 2020 ) . While opportunities for tele - working may be more limited for Pakistan and other LMICs , the above results are suggestive and , for example , tele - health and tele - schooling initiatives have also been rolled - out in Pakistan ( Farooq et al 2020 ) . The group of C19 - focussed CGE model studies , currently in the public domain , includes one application of a single - country CGE model framework similar to the one applied here ( Keogh - Brown et al 2020 ) , and applications of various global model frameworks , including the ImpactECON Supply - Chain Model , a standard CGE model which is a modified version of the Global Trade Analysis Project ( GTAP ) model ( Walmsley , Rose & Wei 2020 ) , and the G - Cubed model , a hybrid DSGE / CGE model with aggregate intertemporal DSGE features , but with an underlying multi - sector CGE model which solves for annual equilibria over a very long 2015 - 2100 time horizon ( McKibbin & Fernando 2020 ) . Among the global studies , Walmsley et al employs a fairly simplistic specification of shocks , including only mandatory business closures of one and four month durations , while McKibbin and Fernando , in spite of being published very early ( 29 February 2020 ) and using scant data including 2003 SARS data from China and rough indicators for inferring country - specific shocks , goes much further and designs global sets of sophisticated country - specific scenarios involving direct and indirect health - .

Public health costs of clinical health outcomes are , however , not inferred or analysed , and lockdown measures are not analysed either , presumably due to the early publication date . Notably , the McKibbin - study finds that “Hong Kong Flu” - and “Spanish Flu” - type pandemics would lead to health - related costs equivalent to respectively 2 % and 8 % declines in global GDP ( $ 2 . 3 & $ 9 . 2 trillion ) , while ( 2 ) the Walmsley - study finds that four months of non - essential business closures would lead to a 21 . 6 % decline of U . S . GDP ( $ 4 . 6 trillion ) and a 23 . 0 % drop in employment ( 36 . 1 million unemployed workers ) . Using the same “Standard M odel” single - country methodology as the current study ( see Methods section below ) , a UK single - country study analysed C19 lockdown scenarios covering a range of business closure NPIs ( BC - NPIs ) , school closure NPIs ( SC - NPIs ) , and home quarantine NPIs ( HQ - NPIs ) ( Keogh - Brown et al 2020 ) , derived from the widely recognized Imperial College COVID - 19 Response Tea m’s preferred intermittent 2 - month lockdown / 1 - month opening - up scenario ( Ferguson , Laydon et al . 2020 ) . A key strength of the single country CGE framework , in a health context , is its ability to accommodate exogenous epidemiological model predictions , and thereby allow for model - consistent public health assessments of economic and clinical health burdens , for non - communicable diseases ( NCDs ) ( Jensen et al 2019a ) and communicable diseases ( CDs ) ( Keogh - Brown et al 2020 ) , but without making assumptions about government preferences . Hence , the focus on analysing policy scenarios , rather than specifying social planning problems , allow decisions on trade - offs to be left up to policy makers – and , by the same token , policymakers are free to apply their own preferences when facing trade - offs between relative economic and clinical health impacts from various competing NPI policy strategies . Finally , it should be mentioned that Imperial College has established a social planning - type framework where an epidemiological model is linked with an economic module via a social planning objective which , in this case , is real GDP ( Haw et al 2020a , 2020b ) . The macroeconomic module is , however , rudimentary , consisting purely of fixed sector - specific production vectors , which are scaled by sector - specific BC - NPI lockdown shares , but which does not involve economic behaviour . .

We apply the epidemiological model as a satellite model , and use it to produce health - related scenario - specific shocks , which we impose on the macroeconomic model to measure overall epidemiological and macroeconomic outcomes of our unmitigated baseline , and three policy scenarios . Our dynamically - recursive macroeconomic model is specified around a core static macroeconomic CGE model framework , also known as the ‘Standard Model’ ( Löfgren , Lee Harris & Robinson 2002 ) – a so - called multi - sector model which allows for analysing a multitude of production activities and retail commodities . Producers aim to maximize profits and consumers aim to maximize welfare , the government collects taxes to fund their recurring spending ( mainly on essential public services ) , savings are collected and channelled into productive investment projects , and domestic retailers engage with foreign traders , to trade in import and export goods . In the current context of modelling NPI policy scenarios , the multi - sectoral nature of our framework has the added advantage that we can specify our model with a level of sectoral detail which allows for sensible disaggregation of the economy’s production sectors into essential and non - essential sectors ( see appendix A for sector classifications ) . We calibrated our static CGE model from a 2014 Pakistan Social Accounting Matrix ( SAM ) which was derived from the Global Trade Analysis Project ( GTAP ) database version 10 ( GTAP 2019 ) . The original 65 production activities were aggregated to 51 ( see appendix A ) with the twin aims to facilitate model simulations , but also to maintain sufficient detail to allow for separation of essential and non - essential production sectors , which is critical for specification and modelling of BC - NPIs within the macroeconomic model . Furthermore , we disaggregated the single SAM household account into four provincial representative households , in order to capture province - specific C19 epidemics and NPI scenarios , and also to allow for analyses of economic impacts across the four Pakistani provinces . 9 Provincial household income and expenditure patterns were derived from the 2015 - 16 Household Integrated Income and Consumption Survey ( HIICS ) ( PBS 2017 ) and used to disaggregate the 9 We had to exclude the two autonomous territories of Gilgit - Baltistan ( GB ) and Azad Jammu & Kashmir ( AJK ) , and the federal Islamabad Capital Territory ( ICT ) from our household disaggregation , since the 2015 - 16 HIICS survey only included survey data for the four main provinces of Pakistan ( PBS 2017 ) . However , since the four provinces is estimated to account for 94 . 7 % of the total Pakistan population in 2020 ( WorldPop 2020 ) , our analyses are likely to provide a good approximation to Pakistan - wide impacts . .

Household - specific factor ownership data and sector - specific employment data ( including numbers of skilled and unskilled workers belonging to the four provincial households and employed in each of the 51 production sectors ) were also extracted from the 2015 - 16 HIICS survey ( PBS 2017 ) . The modelling of province - level labour factor ownerships , within the macroeconomic model , was critical as it allowed us to model shocks to province - specific effective labour factor participation in response to health - related C19 labour absenteeism and labour supply losses due to employed case fatalities . Furthermore , in order to model epidemic progression over 2020 - 21 , we turned the model into a recursively - dynamic model by adding labour and capital factor - updating equations . The labour factor updating equations were calibrated by producing a set of province - level demographic projections , based on a standard demographic model specification ( Jensen et al 2019b ) . The demographic model was calibrated to a set of UN population projections ( UN 2020 ) and disaggregated based on WorldPop province - level demographic data ( WorldPop 2020 ) , and age - and gender - specific labour force participation rates ( PBS 2018 ) were subsequently applied to produce a complete set of baseline province - level labour factor ownership growth path projections for 2014 - 2021 . We also extracted time series of capital stocks and capital depreciation rates for Pakistan from the Penn World Tables data base version 9 . 1 ( PWT 2020 ) and used these data to initialize and calibrate our capital updating equation . With the dynamically - recursive model completed , including fully specified factor - updating equations , we used historical Pakistan GDP growth rates ( WB 2020 ) to establish 2020 as the base year for our 2020 - 21 policy simulations , and we , subsequently , calibrated a counterfactual 2020 - 21 ‘non - C19’ counterfactual growth path to historical real ( 2 . 8 % p . a . ) and nominal ( 5 . 2 % p . a . ) GDP growth rates from the period 2015 - 18 ( ibid . ) against which the C19 baseline and NPI policy scenario impacts could be assessed ( For details on CGE model parametrization and model closure , see appendix C ) . Given that C19 is a contact - transmissible disease , we utilize a well - established transmission - dynamic framework , initially fitted to the epidemic in Wuhan , and based on globally estimated age - varying susceptibility to SARS - CoV - 2 virus infection and age - varying C19 illness severity parameters , as well as four types of age - specific contact patterns at home , at work , at school , and at other locations ( Davies , Klepac et al 2020 ) , exploiting an existing global data set which includes Pakistan - specific 5 - year age - group contact rate matrices ( CRMs ) for work contacts ( W - CRMs ) , school contacts ( S - CRMs ) , home contacts ( H - CRMs ) , and other social contacts ( O - CRMs ) ( Prem , Cook & Jit 2017 ) .

However , in order to separately model province - and territory - specific epidemics , we exploited detailed population data from the WorldPop database ( WorldPop 2020 ) to produce a bespoke set of baseline province - and territory - specific epidemic projections . In order to further improve projections , we adjusted the basic reproduction rate ( R0 ) down from levels around R0 = 2 . 7 , initially estimated for model set - up ( Davies , Klepac et al 2020 ) , to R0 = 1 . 7 , in order to match Pakistan - specific R0 estimates ( Uddin et al 2020 , Ali , Imran & Khan 2020 , Ullah & Khan 2020 ) . 10 In our policy simulations , business closure NPIs ( BC - NPIs ) are associated with changes in W - CRMs , school closure NPIs ( SC - NPIs ) are associated with changes in S - CRMs , home quarantine NPIs ( HQ - NPIs ) are associated with changes in H - CRMs , and group gathering NPIs ( GG - NPIs ) are associated with changes in O - CRMs . In terms of our epidemiological model simulations , the CRM parametric assumptions , underlying our C19 baseline and three NPI policy scenarios 1 - 3 , are presented in Table 2 . The variation in scenario specifications involves ( 1 ) variation in reductions in W - CRM contact rates between - 20 % ( Scenario 1 ) and - 40 % ( Scenarios 2 - 3 ) , and ( 2 ) variation in durations between one - off 10 - week restrictions ( Scenarios 1 - 2 ) , and intermittent 1 - month restrictions / 2 - month relaxations , of W - CRM , S - CRM , H - CRM and O - CRM contact rates . In terms of our macroeconomic model simulations of NPI interventions , needed to effectuate the reductions in contact - rates in policy scenarios 1 - 3 , we assume ( Table 3 ) : ( 1 ) BC - NPI lockdowns affecting 20 % / 40 % of non - essential businesses is required to achieve 20 % / 40 % reduction in W - CRM contact - rates , ( 2 ) Nation - wide SC - NPI school closures are required to achieve 100 % reductions in S - CRM contact - rates , ( 3 ) 10 day HQ - NPI home quarantines , combined with information campaigns ( not modelled ) , are required to achieve 40 % reductions in H - CRM contact - rates , and ( 4 ) nation - wide GG - NPI restrictions on group gatherings ( not modelled ) are required to achieve 20 % reductions in O - CRM contact - rates . The durations of macroeconomic NPI interventions ( Table 3 ) reflect the durations of the epidemiological CRM reductions over our 2020 - 21 time horizon ( Table 2 ) and the timing of the Pakistani C19 epidemic outbreak in late - February 2020 . 10 The derivation of Pakistan - specific R0 estimates were , in some cases , based on alternative approaches to epidemiological modelling including standard SEIR - model frameworks ( Ullah & Khan 2020 ) , and other multi - compartmental transmission model frameworks ( Ali , Imran & Khan 2020 ) . .

In order to derive macroeconomic health - related hospital cost - and labour supply - shocks , for our C19 baseline and three policy scenarios , we make the following parametric assumptions : ( 1 ) average cost of severely ill hospitalized patients is 33 . 32 USD / day ; ( 2 ) average cost of critically ill hospitalized patients is 221 . 18 USD / day ( Torres - Rueda et al 2020 ) ; ( 3 ) one - third of critical patient bed - days are treated in general ward while two - thirds are treated in ICU ( ibid . ) , implying that the average cost of an ICU bed - day is 315 . 11 USD / day ; ( 4 ) body bag cost for case fatalities is 64 . 52 USD / case fatality ( ibid . ) ; ( 5 ) non - hospitalized symptomatic cases have an average sickness duration of 10 weekdays / 7 workdays ; ( 6 ) severely ill and employed patients have a total illness duration of 15 weekdays / 11 workdays ; ( 7 ) critically ill and employed patients have a total illness duration of 17 weekdays / 13 workdays ; ( 8 ) employed case fatalities lose on average 105 + 250 = 355 workdays during 2020 - 21 if they die in 2020 , and on average 125 workdays if they die in 2021 . These eight parametric assumptions , together with age - specific labour force participation rates ( PBS 2018 ) , allow us to derive all health - related costs and labour force impacts , including ( 1 ) two separate decompositions of hospital admission costs ( severely ill vs . critically ill hospitalization costs / non - ICU vs . ICU bed - day costs ) , ( 2 ) case fatality body bag costs , and ( 3 ) labour supply losses from employed non - hospitalized symptomatic cases , employed hospitalized severely and critically ill patients , and employed case fatalities . The NPI interventions , needed to effectuate reductions in CRM contact rates , are quantified in the following way : ( 1 ) BC - NPI business closures for non - essential businesses are implemented by fixed proportional sector - specific factor demand reductions ; ( 2 ) SC - NPI school closures’ impacts on parent s’ labour force participation are assessed by dividing the number of province - specific school - age children ( ages 5 - 14 ) by province - specific population - weighted average fertility rates ( UN 2020 ) , and multiplying by ‘fertility age’ - weighted female labour force participation rates ( PBS 2018 ) , thereby assuming that one parent per average - sized family will be devoting their time to home schooling , and assuming that that parent will be the mother – an important conservative assumption given the significant gender - imbalance in Pakistani labour force participation rates ( ibid . ) ; ( 3 ) HQ - NPI home quarantine restrictions are assumed to be 14 days / 10 workdays per non - hospitalized symptomatic case , thereby adding 3 additional workdays lost beyond our assumed C19 baseline 7 workday absenteeism per non - hospitalized symptomatic case . .

The aggregate results indicate that an unmitigated Pakistan C19 epidemic , by itself , would have led to a 0 . 12 % reduction in Pakistani GDP ( - 721mn USD ) , and a total of 0 . 65mn critically ill and 1 . 52mn severely ill C19 patients ; and 405 , 000 Pakistani citizens would have lost their lives to the disease during 2020 - 21 . Our one - off 10 - week lockdown scenarios 1 - 2 would only have postponed ( Table 5 ) , but not lessened ( Table 4 ) , the aggregate disease burden , within our two year time horizon , and the cost to society would have been 10 - 20 times higher than the unmitigated baseline . Hence , while both of the NPI policy scenarios 1 - 2 , similar to the unmitigated baseline , would have led to 0 . 65mn critically ill / 1 . 52mn severely ill / 404 - 405 , 000 case fatalities during 2020 - 21 , their cost to Pakistani society would have increased by an order of magnitude ( or more ) to respectively 1 . 29 % of GDP ( 7 . 8bn USD ) for Scenario 1 , and 2 . 27 % ( 13 . 7bn USD ) for Scenario 2 . Based on these results , it is evident that a one - off time - limited 10 - week lockdown would not have been effective in containing the Pakistani epidemic . In spite of their limited long - term success in containing transmission , infections , and deaths , these one - off NPI interventions might still have been cost - effective in terms of preserving public health . Under scenarios 1 and 2 , the overwhelming majority of clinical presentations would have been delayed by around one year , the number of life years saved , from postponed case fatalities , would have been counted in the 100 , 000s , and both severe clinical and Long - COVID health repercussions would have been postponed for a year , bringing additional health benefits . For Scenario 1 , for example , the NPI cost per saved life - year would have been < $ 20 , 000 , indicating that this scenario , in spite of limited long - term containment of the epidemic , could still , possibly , have been cost - effective . Turning to Scenario 3 , the GDP cost of pursuing this intermittent lockdown scenario would have been > 50 times higher than the unmitigated baseline , costing Pakistani society a total of 37 . 9bn USD ( 6 . 26 % of GDP ) or 37 . 1bn USD ( 6 . 14 % of GDP ) more than the baseline during 2020 - 21 ( Table 4 ) . However , the recurring nature of the strategy also means that the aggregate long - term disease burden would have been reduced at the end of our two year time horizon , including reductions in critically ill C19 patients from 0 . 65mn to 0 . 38mn ( - 42 % ) , severely ill C19 patients from 1 . 52mn to 0 . 89mn ( - 43 % ) , and case fatalities from 405 , 000 citizens to 237 , 000 citizens ( - 42 % ) . This suggests that our intermittent scenario , although costly both in pecuniary terms and in lives lost , could be an , at least partially , effective strategy for long - term containment and control of the Pakistani C19 .

That being said , the implied reduction in case fatalities , over our two - year horizon , ‘ only ’ amounts to 41 . 5 % , and the number of life - years saved are ‘only’ likely to be in the order of 500 , 000 , indicating a cost per life saved of around $ 75 , 000 . Hence , the number of lives saved by the hard broad - based intermittent lockdown strategy may not be sufficiently large , for it to be considered as cost - effective compared with ( less costly ) healthcare interventions . Taking a longer - term perspective , and factoring - in the future roll - out of vaccination programmes , this conclusion may , however , change quite dramatically . If vaccine - rollout was to be completed by end - of - 2021 , the postponement of infections and deaths may transition from being temporary to being permanent , and the halving of case fatalities in Scenario 3 , compared to Scenario 1 , could result , not just in > 200 , 000 life - years saved during 2020 - 21 , but possibly millions of life - years saved over the coming decade . Thus , subject to confounding by virus mutations and their resulting requirement for vaccine re - development and additional vaccine roll - out programmes , our intermittent lockdown scenario 3 might be considered to be cost - effective and preferable to our one - off 10 - week lockdown scenario 1 ( even if vaccination programme costs end up running into billions USD ) . Looking at scenario cost dynamics between 2020 and 2021 , ( Table 5 ) , our results indicate that an unmitigated epidemic would incur overall GDP costs of 0 . 5bn USD in 2020 and 0 . 2bn USD in 2021 ( 70 % / 30 % ) . In contrast the costs incurred for other scenarios would be 6 . 6 / 1 . 2bn USD ( 85 % / 15 % ) for scenario 1 , 12 . 2 / 1 . 5bn USD ( 89 % / 11 % ) for scenario 2 and 15 . 5 / 22 . 4bn USD ( 45 % / 55 % ) for scenario 3 . The BC - NPI costs in Table 5 ( row three ) highlight that these cost dynamics are driven by the timing of business lockdowns , indicating that employing a hard broad - based intermittent lockdown strategy , akin to scenario 3 , may only be cost - effective over the very long - term ( beyond our two - year time horizon ) , if efficacious vaccine roll - out is used to limit the future need for BC - NPIs . Looking at the shorter perspective and comparing our epidemiologically simulated numbers of symptomatic cases and case fatalities for 2020 ( Table 5 ) , for Scenario 1 ( 1 . 75mn symptomatic cases & 4 , 500 fatalities ) , Scenario 2 ( 1 . 27mn symptomatic cases & 3 , 300 fatalities ) and Scenario 3 ( 1 . 41mn symptomatic cases & 6 , 700 fatalities ) , with observed cumulative Pakistani outcomes on 31 . December 2020 ( 482 , 506 confirmed cases & 10 , 176 fatalities ) ( GoP 2021 ) , suggests that Pakistan’s smart lockdown strategy may not have fully accomplished the reduction in reproduction number and clinical outcomes that our hard broad - based lockdown scenarios could have accomplished . Hence , the number of case fatalities is around 50 % higher than would have been accomplished with the intermittent 1 - month lockdown / 2 - months opening - up scenario 3 , and 2 - 3 times as high as what might have been accomplished by a full 10 - week lockdown in early spring of 2020 . .

This confirms that BC - NPI business closures dominate GDP costs in the non - smart society - wide lockdown strategies , analysed here , and especially so in the intermittent lockdown scenario 3 . Nonetheless , the results also show that HQ - NPI quarantine restrictions , and , especially , SC - NPI school closures , represent non - negligible GDP costs , and that combined non - BC - NPI GDP costs exceed unmitigated baseline costs by a factor of 1 . 5 ( Scenarios 1 - 2 ) to 2 . 6 ( Scenario 3 ) . Looking at the health - related GDP costs ( Table 4 ) , which include hospital costs and labour supply losses , it is interesting to note that increasing hospital costs provide a ( small ) economic stimulus ( the induced shift in final demand composition , towards health services , seems to bring efficiency gains due to Pakistan being a second - best policy environment ) , while labour force losses , due to C19 illness and death , creates a larger drag on GDP . Overall , net health - related GDP costs for the uncontrolled baseline scenario amount to 721mn USD . Labour - related GDP losses dominate health - related costs , and they vary between 782mn USD ( baseline ) , 600mn USD ( Scenarios 1 - 2 ) and 376mn USD ( scenario 3 ) ( Table 4 ) . Tables 6 - 7 provide a breakdown of final demand drivers of GDP impacts . Looking at the GDP impacts of BC - NPI restrictions , they confirm that reduced real private consumption ( RCP ) ( 0 . 8 - 4 . 9 % of real GDP ) drives real GDP impacts , and accounts for around 84 % of the total final demand reduction ( not shown ) . Since RCP accounts for 86 % of final demand along the counterfactual growth path ( Table 6 ) , RCP contributes proportionally to the final demand / real GDP reductions of BC - NPI interventions . Interestingly , the other domestic final demand components change disproportionally , including increases in real government consumption ( RCG ) ( 0 . 1 - 0 . 5 % of real GDP ) and relatively strong reductions in real investment ( RINV ) ( 0 . 2 - 1 . 4 % of real GDP ) , while real import and real export impacts even out due to our fixed BoP external macro - closure ( see appendix C ) . The systematic increases in RCG are conditioned by our government budget closure ( see appendix C ) , i . e . government consumption being fixed at the counterfactual growth path and only varying with scenario - specific changes in hospital costs . Hence , since declining employment opportunities in non - essential sectors are likely to drive down wages , and , by implication , reduce costs of essential public services ( i . e . the government price deflator ) , government service delivery opportunities increase within a fixed government budget environment . .

Since RINV accounts for 12 % of final demand along the counterfactual growth path ( Table 6 ) , it contributes disproportionally to the final demand ( and real GDP ) reductions of BC - NPI interventions . The supply - side driven BC - NPI sector lockdowns , including non - essential investment goods sectors , drives up investment prices , and this drives down real investment demand ( beyond the reduction in private savings ) . The implications are three - fold : ( 1 ) 2020 real GDP declines due to reduced same - period investment demand , ( 2 ) 2021 GDP declines due to reduced 2020 capital accumulation , and reduced 2021 investment demand , and ( 3 ) longer - term GDP ( beyond our two - year time horizon ) declines are expected due to the reduced 2020 - 21 capital accumulation . Turning to the SC - NPI and HQ - NPI restrictions , they do not involve BC - NPI - style sector - specific supply - side restrictions . While it has already been established that the labour force impacts of these restrictions are notable , reducing real GDP by more than the unmitigated epidemic , itself , these restrictions do not affect economic sectors asymmetrically . By implication , all final demand components are reduced proportionally ( more or less ) , including RCP and RINV accounting for respectively 87 - 88 % and 10 % of final demand reductions . The smaller relative real investment impacts imply smaller long - term growth impacts , compared to the BC - NPI restrictions , suggesting that the SC - NPI and HQ - NPI restrictions , in combination with Pakistan’s preferred smart business lockdown - measures , may be a preferred strategy . A regional breakdown of health - related GDP impacts across the four main regions of Pakistan ( Tables 8 - 9 ) shows that hospital and patient - related real GDP losses are shared across regions in proportion to regional population size and clinical outcome numbers . If the Pakistan epidemic had not been controlled , our baseline simulation indicates that Punjab , being the largest region , would have expanded hospital activity the most , and , by implication , also expanded real GDP the most ( 36mn USD ) , followed by Sindh ( 16mn USD ) , Balochistan ( 3mn USD ) , and KPK ( 3mn USD ) , but these economic ‘benefits’ would have been outweighed by stronger regional labour force - related GDP losses , including Punjab ( 495mn USD ) , Sindh ( 188mn USD ) , Balochistan ( 37mn USD ) and KPK ( 22mn USD ) . As already mentioned , aggregate labour force GDP losses decline from 782mn USD ( unmitigated baseline ) to 600mn USD in scenarios 1 - 2 ( 23 % reduction ) , and to 376mn USD in scenario 3 ( 52 % reduction ) , and our province - level results confirm that these reductions ( except for minor non - linearities ) would be shared , almost proportionally , across the four provinces . This demonstrates the potential for NPI policy scenarios to simultaneously lower health burdens and health - related economic burdens , and to do it in an equitable way , across the four provinces of Pakistan . Obviously , this conclusion has to be tempered , as discussed at length , by the large GDP costs which would result from implementing the hard FL - style lockdown strategies , analysed here . .

Since the majority of case fatalities and symptomatic cases , respectively 345 , 000 and 35 . 9mn , would have occurred in 2020 , the case fatality and confirmed case numbers , actually achieved by 31 . December 2020 ( 10 , 176 fatalities & 482 , 506 confirmed cases ) ( GoP 2021 ) and by 14 . October 2021 ( 28 , 201 fatalities and 1 , 261 , 685 confirmed cases ) ( Ritchie 2021 ) , represents an outcome which is much better than feared by Pakistani health officials during Spring 2020 when the national C19 epidemic took off . When compared to our NPI policy scenarios , it may be surmised that , while Pakistan’s switch from forced broad - based lockdowns during 15 - 30 . March 2020 , to a less constrained partial / smart lockdown strategy from 31 . March 2020 , is likely to have lowered the macroeconomic costs of C19 control , it is equally likely to have been less favourable in terms of health outcomes . Both our forced one - off and intermittent strategies would have postponed the C19 epidemic until 2021 , lowering symptomatic case numbers and case fatalities , during 2020 , to respectively 1 . 27 - 1 . 74mn cases & 3 , 300 - 4 , 500 fatalities ( scenarios 1 - 2 ) , and to 1 . 41mn cases & 6 , 700 fatalities ( scenario 3 ) . Not considering the great uncertainty during the initial months of the C19 pandemic , the Pakistani authorities could therefore , potentially , have further lowered clinical outcomes and bought more time for the ( at the time uncertain ) vaccine development and subsequent vaccine roll - out . However , the potential reductions in case fatalities , ranging from 50 % in intermittent scenario 3 , to a two - fold / three - fold reduction in the 10 - week forced lockdown scenarios 1 - 2 , would have come at an NPI - related 2020 GDP cost to society amounting to between 6 . 6 - 15 . 5bn USD ( 2 . 2 % - 5 . 2 % of 2020 GDP ) . While the 2020 GDP cost of Pakistan’s smart lockdown strategy remains unclear , Pakistan’s real GDP growth rates had been declining , over past ( fiscal ) years , from 5 . 2 % and 5 . 5 % during 2016 - 17 and 2017 - 18 , to 1 . 9 % during 2018 - 19 ( PBS 2021 ) . Based on the trend decline in real GDP over previous years , and the downward revision of the 2018 - 19 growth rate to 1 . 0 % and the subsequent estimate of 0 . 5 % GDP growth during 2019 - 20 ( WB 2021 ) combined with relatively favourable World Economic Outlook projections of 1 . 5 % growth during 2020 - 21 published in January 2021 ( IMF 2021 ) , it would seem that Pakistan , during 2020 , has managed to control their C19 epidemic at a relatively low GDP cost to Pakistani society . If the Pakistani authorities had adopted hard lockdown strategies , akin to our simulated policy scenarios , they could therefore have reduced clinical outcomes but only at the expense of much higher GDP costs , a large part of which would likely have affected low - income .

In general , the Pakistani national and provincial authorities seem to have taken a balanced approach to C19 epidemic control , during 2020 , via management of contact numbers at Pakistani schools and within Pakistani households , to such an extent that it has allowed business closures to be limited to selected sectors , and this balanced approach , with a focus on at most 1 - day - a - week or 2 - day - a - week business lockdowns , limited to hotspot areas , and coordinated across provinces and territories by the NCOC National Command Operation Center , was successfully continued throughout the alpha and delta variant corona - waves of 2021 . Going forward , our results suggest that the national Pakistani C19 epidemic is likely to affect all parts of Pakistani society , perhaps with a bias towards urban areas with high population densities , but otherwise fairly equally across provinces . Furthermore , our results suggest that hard broad - based long - duration lockdowns are likely to be a costly approach to reduced human activity and C19 epidemic control . Given that the smart lockdown approach appears to have been successful during 2020 - 21 , it would probably serve Pakistan well to continue the use of limited business closures , possibly complemented by more wide - ranging interventions to control contact numbers at schools , in Pakistani homes ( through information campaigns ) , and in other locations , in order to ensure that interventions remain effective , but also keep the GDP cost of their lockdown strategy manageable , especially for poorer informal sector households . Resumption of the successful Ehsass transfer program could also be considered , but this would , probably , only be warranted if the now widespread transmission of the B117 strain were to further accelerate and turn into nation - wide exponential growth , with costly nation - wide broad - based long - duration lockdowns to follow . In terms of impacts on the composition of final demand , our simulated NPI strategies were shown to have lop - sided impacts on real investment . Hence , within our policy scenarios , unchanged , or slightly increasing , real government consumption crowded - out real investment within a shrinking economy . This is important since declining real investment demand affects both current and future income generation via capital accumulation . Since business closure restrictions were seen to have a particularly lopsided impact on investment demand , a strategy composed of school closure and home quarantine restrictions , in combination with Pakistan’s preferred sm art business lockdown - measures , may be a preferred strategy , both from a short - term informal worker economy - perspective , and from a longer - term formal economy growth perspective . Regardless of the NPI strategy , once effective epidemic control has been established , there will be a need , not only for short - term stabilization of final demand , for example , via increased public investment demand for productive infrastructure projects , but also for stimulating private investment demand e . g . via fiscal .

The main lesson , from our policy scenarios , is that there is a clear trade - off between Covid - 19 epidemic control and macroeconomic outcomes in Pakistan , and , potentially , in other LMICs , where access to pharmaceutical interventions is limited and where epidemic control is conditioned on non - pharmaceutical interventions . This trade - off is mainly conditioned by the extent to which human activity , measured by numbers of human contacts , can be controlled outside of workplaces . Hence , to the extent that a given population , at the behest of health authorities , accepts to limit their social contacts , at home and in other non - workplace settings , during peak transmission periods , this will lessen the need for broad - based business - closures , and allow for less costly ‘smart lockdown’ approaches with a focus on shorter and more geographically focussed reductions in non - business human contacts . A corollary to the above is that subsequent pharmaceutical interventions , including the on - going roll - out of vaccines in Pakistan and abroad , is likely to have the highest value in societies where populations , for one reason or another , are not willing or able to reduce non - business contacts , for example refusing to abide by group gathering restrictions , during peak transmission periods . In these types of societies , the need for longer and more costly business - lockdowns are required , in order to avoid excessive pressures on health systems and excessive increases in excess mortality rates – and , by implication , the GDP value of vaccine roll - out , in these societies , is greater . This is not to say that the loss in quality of life , among populations with greater capacity for reducing social contacts , is not as great ( or greater ) , and that these societies will not experience equally great ( or greater ) increases in quality of life from vaccine roll - outs , but the GDP value of vaccines is , nonetheless , likely to be greater in societies with less capacity for reducing social contacts . A further corollary is that , while vaccine roll - outs may be prioritized higher , on economic grounds , in societies with less capacity for reducing social contacts , these societies are also likely to perform vaccine roll - out in a high - transmission setting , implying that , if national vaccine roll - out programs , for some reason , were to proceed slowly or be unable to reach heard immunity levels e . g . due to vaccine supply interruptions or vaccine scepticism , there would be an elevated risk of vaccine - specific mutations . By the same token , slow vaccine roll - out in populous countries , such as Pakistan , with seeming greater capacity for reducing social contacts , but with limited capacity for timely access to vaccines at scale , may also lead to long - term co - existence of pools of vaccinated and infectious individuals , and , thereby , to an elevated risk of vaccine - specific mutations and avoidable C19 - related deaths . While the problem of dealing with avoidable deaths is , in principle , a domestic .

Several caveats apply to our analyses . While our economic assessments can be modified to encompass the consequences of changes to many types of social and economic NPI interventions , including business and school closures , it should be recognized that our approach disregards trade - offs in terms of important non - monetary impacts such as mental health for patients , relatives , health workers and the broader public , and ( lack of ) timely hospital treatment of non - C19 patients . Evidence is emerging regarding the potential longer - term Long - COVID post - C19 health sequelae ( Huang et al 2021 , Iqbal et al 2021 , Ahmed , Patel et al 2020 , Perrin et al 2020 ) and negative health system spillovers on other healthcare tasks during peak transmission periods , including treatment and screening for various cancer types ( Skovlund et al 2021 ) . Since these post - C19 manifestations and health system spillovers are still being studied , we did not account for them in our simulation analyses , but these twin areas do represent important areas of future research , in order to better understand longer - term post - C19 impacts on quality of life , and the resilience and preparedness of existing healthcare systems . While full model integration has been achieved for macroeconomic modelling of other infectious diseases such as malaria ( Jensen et al 2018 , Smith et al 2020 ) , knowledge gaps regarding socioeconomic feedback effects on epidemiological model parameters including human activity and contact matrices , currently bar full C19 epidemiological model integration . Furthermore , our approach to health - related GDP cost assessment , with its focus on labour force participation and hospital costs , is conservative in the sense that it excludes other potential transmission channels , for example , G - Cubed model channels such as increased equity risk premia , increased sector - specific ( transport ) costs of production , and changes in consumer preferences ( McKibbin & Fernando 2020 ) . That being said , the G - Cubed model simulations of 2 - 8 % global C19 health - related GDP costs ( ibid . ) do not seem to have been borne out by reality in e . g . Pakistan . Going forward , the main methodological challenges will be to investigate the importance of economic feedback effects from , for example , household income and poverty levels to epidemiological model parameters , including age - stratified matrices for work , school , home , and other social contacts , but also to explore the validity of additional pathways for health - related GDP costs . .

Our analyses could also possibly have been strengthened by explicit fitting of our epidemiological model to historical clinical trends . However , whilst this might have provided slightly different health burden and policy impact results , it would have been unlikely to substantially change our results and would also have been complicated by the need to disentangle smart lockdown impacts in order to derive a counterfactual model suitable for our simulations of uncontrolled and NPI - controlled epidemic scenarios . Since the purpose of this study is to present policy analyses of specific NPI scenarios , rather than forecasting of the future Pakistan C19 epidemic , we therefore decided to limit ourselves to application of our non - fitted epidemiological model framework . Similarly , due to limited knowledge of seasonal contact patterns , and complexities of modelling dynamic changes in contact matrices , most C19 epidemiological modelling applications ( including our own ) do not capture seasonality . As data becomes available , future applications could therefore also extend our analysis to capture policy - induced changes in timing and steepness of ( winter ) peaks and their implications for seasonal hospital capacity utilization , and better understand the optimal timing and duration of NPI policy interventions , in order to better support NPI epidemic control decision making . In terms of future C19 control strategies , for Pakistan and other LMICs , the key issue involves vaccine roll - out in the context of potential delays in access to ( efficacious ) vaccine deliveries , and potential waning of vaccine efficacy either due to natural rates of immune response waning , or due to potential introduction or development of mutated C19 strains with increased resistance to vaccine - induced antibody responses . Due to the very real threats of slow vaccine roll - out and vaccine waning , health authorities in Pakistan and elsewhere should continue to maintain an epidemic preparedness infrastructure , which allows for rapid deployment of NPIs in the advent of future C19 resurgence and acceleration in transmission growth rates . While Pakistan has a good track - record of C19 epidemic control , so far ( until early - November 2021 ) , such a resurgence scenario is a very real possibility given the recent nation - wide community - transmission of the B1617 delta variant throughout Pakistan – and , given that vaccine roll - is still far from having achieved herd immunity , this pattern may well repeat itself over the coming years . Planning for such a scenario , including continued vigilance in the design of the vaccination roll - out , including continued focus on managing incentives for fellow citizens to take both the first and second jab , and potential future re - vaccination campaigns with intermittent smart lockdowns to control periods of C19 resurgence , should therefore be the focus of future C19 modelling efforts , especially in Pakistan and other LMICs , but also in HICs due to the unavoidable spread of mutated strains in a globalized world .

That being said , Pakistan continues to face a reality where they have only recently managed to reduce country - wide community - transmission of the highly infectious B1617 variant , and , in spite of the successful move by national authorities to provide nation - wide lockdown guidelines , both provincial and national health authorities should consider re - examining existing control strategies , including a possible strengthening of focus on the management of non - business human activity in Pakistani society , and on continuously maintaining effective local pandemic preparedness systems . .

Pakistan demographic and health situation Pakistan demographic and health trends Pakistan experienced rapid population growth after independence in 1947 . After moderate growth during the 1950s ( 1 . 55 % p . a . ) , the demographic transition , with declining mortality rates , led to rapid population growth during the 1960s ( 4 . 3 % p . a . ) , 1970s ( 3 . 6 % p . a . ) and into the 1980s ( 3 . 1 % p . a . ) Since the 1990s , average population growth rates have hovered around 2 . 3 - 2 . 6 % p . a . , due to fertility rates declining by an average - 2 . 0 % p . a . over the past three decades ( Figure B . 1 ) ( GBD 2020 ) . Recently accelerating declines in Pakistani age - specific fertility rates ( ibid . ) confirms that Pakistan can start to eye the end of her demographic transition . This can be verified , visually , by the broadening of the Pakistani population pyramid between 2010 and 2019 ( Figure B . 1 ) . Pakistani population growth has also been accompanied by a changing demographic composition including a declining imbalance in the female - to - male gender ratio , and a population share of 65 + year olds which declined from 5 . 2 % ( 1950 ) to 3 . 2 % ( 2010 ) before increasing to 3 . 4 % in 2019 ( Figure B . 1 ) . Nonetheless , the Pakistani population remains fairly young with the 0 - 39 age group accounting for 81 % of the population . Pakistani disease burdens of major infectious diseases such as TB , HIV / AIDS , and malaria , although variable year - on - year , has been trending downwards over recent years ( Figure B . 2 ) . National Pakistan disease background Pakistan is a country which has been struggling with the twin challenges of a weak and underfunded health system and high population growth ( see Figure B . 1 ) , and with twin CD and NCD burdens ( see Figure B . 2 ) ( GBD 2020 ) . However , the CD disease burden has been declining over the last couple of decades , and now amount to only around one - fifth of the total burden ( ibid . ) Pakistan experienced rapid population growth after independence in 1947 , including growth rates of 3 - 4 % p . a . during the 1960s , 1970s , and 1980s . Since the 1990s , growth rates have hovered around 2 . 3 - 2 . 6 % due to declining fertility rates ( - 2 . 0 % p . a . ) , but , more recently , accelerating reductions in age - specific fertility rates have led to a renewed decline in population growth and a broadening of the Pakistani population pyramid . This confirms that Pakistan can start to eye the end of her demographic transition , and this is confirmed by declining imbalances in the female - to - male gender ratio , and a population share of 65 + year olds which , after declining from 5 . 2 % ( 1950 ) to 3 . 2 % ( 2010 ) , has recently increased to 3 . 4 % in 2019 . Nonetheless , the Pakistani population remains fairly young with the 0 - 39 age group accounting for 81 % of the population ( GBD 2020 ) . .

The relatively young population , and the fact that Pakistan has still not completed her demographic transition , may therefore provide a partial explanation for her relatively low C19 counts , so far , including 283 confirmed cases and 6 . 3 case fatalities per 100 , 000 population which compares well with 4000 - 9000 confirmed cases and 130 - 180 case fatalities per 100 , 000 population in other ( select ) populous countries ( see Figure B . 4 ) . Other factors , identified by Nguiemkeu & Tadedjeu as significantly affecting relative C19 caseloads , include demographic and geographic variables such as population density ( + ) , urban population share ( + ) , and temperature ( - ) , while they find socio - demographic variables such as GDP per capita and health expenditures to be insignificant ( ibid . ) The authors also note a caveat to their results , namely that “duration since start of epidemic” has a significantly positive secular impact on caseloads . Specifically , they demonstrate that Sub - Saharan Africa , in spite of having low initial caseloads , are experiencing a particularly high secular trend - increase in caseloads . While no attempt was made to undertake a separate analysis of South Asia , the identification of a high secular trend for Sub - Saharan Africa , with their relatively low confirmed caseloads and young populations , could be seen as a warning sign for Pakistan , that a young population and low initial caseloads , by themselves , may not shield her broader population in the longer term . In terms of population density , the rapid post - independence population growth has increased the Pakistani population density from 59 . 8 to 275 . 3 people / km2 between 1950 and 2018 , implying that Pakistan has moved from being 82 nd to being 41 st most densely populated country in the world , and suggesting that exposure to communicable disease has increased over time . At the same time , disease burdens of major infectious diseases such as TB , HIV / AIDS , and malaria , although variable year - on - year , has been trending downwards over recent years ( see Figure B . 2 ) , indicating that improvements in sanitation and other preventive measures have , so far , allowed Pakistan to maintain control over the spread of communicable disease across her increasingly densely populated territory . Regional Pakistan disease background After the 18 th constitutional amendment , passed in 2010 , Pakistan consisted of eight regions , and after adoption of the 25 th constitutional amendment , passed in 2018 and leading to merger of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( FATA ) with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ( KP ) , Pakistan has consisted of seven administrative units including four provinces : Balochistan , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ( KPK ) , Punjab , .

In terms of geography and climate , Pakistan’s territory can be broadly divided into three regions : the northern highlands ( including KPK ) with hot summers and cold winters ( average winter temperatures < 0 degrees Celsius ) , the Balochistan Plateau ( including most of Balochistan but excluding the coastline ) with hot summers and mild winters ( average winter temperatures > 0 degrees Celsius ) , and the fertile Indus River plains ( including the populous Punjab / Sindh provinces ) with hot summers and mild / very mild winters ( average winter temperatures > 0 degrees Celsius in Punjab and ICT , and > > 0 degrees Celsius in Sindh ) . While it has been suggested that climatic conditions , proxied by average temperatures , may condition the variation in caseloads between countries ( Nguiemkeu & Tadedjeu 2021 ) , the climatic variations between Pakistani provinces and territories do not seem to have created systematic variations in C19 - epidemics between the regions of Pakistan . All four regions experienced accelerating transmission in late - October 2020 ( see Figure B . 3 ) suggesting that seasonality , rather than climate , were increasing transmission during the winter - months . However , in spite of the seasonally upward - sloping curves , relative levels of transmission and case fatalities , so far ( by 11 March 2021 ) , remain low by almost any standard . The province - and territory - level data shows that all provinces and territories have , so far , managed to keep the C19 - epidemic under relative control , perhaps with the exception of ICT which are showing the highest regional confirmed case count and case fatality rates amounting to respectively 1848 confirmed cases and 20 . 5 deaths per 100 , 000 population ( per 11 March 2021 ) . There are also slightly different epidemic patterns between , on the one hand , the four provinces ( accounting for 95 % of the Pakistani population ) which quickly moved to gain control over the epidemic during June - July 2020 , followed by a mild acceleration in transmission in late - October 2020 and mild constant growth during January - February 2021 ( and , for Punjab , followed , in early - March , by strong re - acceleration in 7 - day transmission growth rates from 2 . 5 % ( 7 - day period ending 28 February ) to 4 . 3 % ( 7 - day period ending 11 March ) , and , on the other hand , the territories which , in the case of GB , only managed to break the curve in late - September 2020 ( but , impressively , managed to maintain relative control throughout the winter - months ) , and , in the case of AJK and ICT , after seeing exponential increases in confirmed cases and case fatalities starting late - October 2020 , they managed to stabilize , and , in the case of ICT decelerate , growth rates during January - February 2021 ( but , similar to Punjab , a beginning re - acceleration of weekly transmission growth rates , in early - .

Interestingly , the regional data demonstrates that ICT , apart from Balochistan , has the lowest observed Case Fatality Rates ( CFR ) per confirmed case ( Table B . 1 ) . This can also be visually verified with reference to Figure B . 3 ( where primary and secondary vertical axis units have been normalized to match ICT numbers on 11 March 2021 ) , by noting that regional case fatality - curves , for all other regions except Balochistan , has consistently dominated the confirmed case count - curves since June 2020 . The observed regional CFRs per confirmed case ( per 11 March 2021 ) range from 1 . 04 % in Balochistan and 1 . 11 % in ICT , to 2 . 08 % and 2 . 93 % in the territories of GB and AJK , and to 2 . 85 % and 3 . 12 % in the KPK and Punjab provinces . Sindh province has an intermediate observed CFR of 1 . 71 % . Benchmarking of observed regional CFRs against ICT , which has experienced both the highest ( and strongest winter - acceleration in ) confirmed case counts and case fatalities per 100 , 000 population , as well as the second - lowest observed CFR , suggests that ( 1 ) the highly urbanized nature of ICT is conducive for the spread of C19 - virus , ( 2 ) that the advent of winter , with average minimum temperatures in the range of 3 - 5 degrees Celsius , is likely to have further increased transmission in ICT , and ( 3 ) the high concentration of health facilities in ICT may be keeping a lid on the CFR rate relative to other regions . While the former hypothesis , linking urbanization with high transmission , is confirmed by other evidence discussed above ( Nguiemkeu & Tadedjeu 2021 ) , the latter hypothesis , linking concentration of tertiary health facilities with CFRs , may require nuancing in the current context . First of all , none of the regional epidemics have exceeded hospital capacity implying that differences in regional treatment capacity is unlikely to be responsible for the regional variation in CFRs . Another more likely explanation relates to differences in regional test capacity , which may lower numbers of confirmed cases in poorer regions such as Balochistan . It could also be hypothesized that less urbanized regions such as Balochistan , in spite of experiencing reduced transmission due to lower population density , should experience elevated CFRs due to greater average distances to tertiary health facilities . Such elevated CFRs may , however , not be observed due to more limited test capacity . Interestingly , the two mountainous territories of GB and AJK , and the hilly province of KPK , have intermediate numbers of confirmed cases in the order of 230 - 458 per 100 , 000 and relatively high observed CFRs in the order of 2 . 08 % - 2 . 93 % . Within this group of regions , the second - highest CFR ( almost as high as AJK ) and lowest confirmed case count - rate is observed in the hilly KPK province , .

Most importantly , the two largest provinces , Punjab and Sindh , which accounts for a combined 77 % of the Pakistani population , seems to have managed to control their province - level epidemics , so far , keeping confirmed case numbers down to 144 - 503 per 100 , 000 and maintain CFRs in the range 1 . 71 - 3 . 12 % . The good overall Pakistani performance , so far , must be ascribed , partly , to the Punjabi and Sindh provincial governments , which seems to have been able to effectively contain their provincial epidemics , and , in spite of a relatively high CFR of 3 . 12 % in Punjab , to keep observed case count - rates at low levels . While smart lockdown NPIs may have played a part in the impressive containment , so far , and while the Punjab and Sindh climate may have favoured out - door activities during at least the first part of the epidemic , until night - time temperatures started dropping below 20C towards end - of - October 2020 , there is a need for province authorities to remain vigilant . Hence , in spite of the impressive containment , including the reduction of 7 - day confirmed case count growth rates , which , after increasing from around 1 % during the first week of November to between 4 % ( Punjab ) and 7 % ( Sindh ) during the first week of December , had been reduced to between 0 . 8 - 2 . 5 % during the last week of February 2021 , the Punjab and Sindh authorities would probably be well advised to continue to be vigilant because of the risk posed by accelerating transmission of the highly infectious B117 strain . Hence , in the case of Punjab , where B117 became dominant in several urban centres in early - March 2021 , 7 - day transmission growth rates re - accelerated from 2 . 5 % ( 7 - day period ending 28 February ) to 4 . 3 % ( 7 - day period ending 11 March ) , and , due to its increased infectiousness and the lack of epidemic control instruments for containment , the strain is likely to become dominant throughout the rest of Punjab , Sindh , and the rest of Pakistan , during spring 2021 . International disease context Pakistan and South Asian ( SA ) countries , more broadly , have , so far , been relatively successful in controlling their C19 - epidemics . This can be confirmed by international case count and case fatality comparisons vis - à - vis select countries , around the world , with large populations and with , in most cases , rampant and multi - wave epidemics ( Figure B . 4 ) . By 11 March 2021 , all SA countries had experienced relatively moderate - sized C19 - epidemics as measured by case counts and case fatalities per 100 , 000 population . While India had recorded the fourth - highest number of confirmed case fatalities in the world ( 158 , 306 ) , only surpassed by the US ( 530 , 821 ) , Brazil ( 272 , 889 ) , and Mexico ( 193 , 152 ) , a nd vastly outnumbering Pakistan’s case fatality count ( 13 , 430 ) ( Ritchie 2021 ) , India’s population size meant that she had ‘only’ recorded 836 confirmed cases and 11 . 7 case fatalities per 100 , 000 population ; and Pakistan’s record was even more ‘favourable’ with 283 confirmed cases and 6 . 3 case fatalities per 100 , 000 population . In a regional SA context , Pakistan ranked fifth and fourth , .

Hence , both by international and regional SA standards , Pakistan’s C19 epidemic has , so far , been well - controlled , but the acceleration in community - transmission of B117 , during early - March 2021 is , nonetheless , a cause for concern . .

Macroeconomic methods background C . 1 . CGE model parameters in terms of CGE model parameterization and macro - closure , household demand is governed by a set of Linear Expenditure Systems ( LES ) ; Production is specified as Constant Elasticity of Substitution ( CES ) functions of aggregate intermediate input demands ( disaggregate commodity input demands are determined by Leontief specifications ) and aggregate factor input demands ( disaggregate factor input demands are also determined by CES specifications ) with standard elasticity values for the top - level production specifications ( 0 . 8 ) and the bottom - level factor input demand specifications ( 0 . 6 ) ; Trade between domestic and foreign agents is specified as a function of relative prices ( determined by the real exchange rate ) , based on Armington CES specifications on the import side and Constant Elasticity of Transformation ( CET ) specifications on the export side . Standard trade elasticity values were applied on the import side ( 1 . 2 ) and on the export side ( 1 . 5 ) . C . 2 . CGE model macro closure Our macroeconomic model closure specifies the GDP deflator as price numeraire , i . e . it is kept fixed at the counterfactual growth path . Furthermore , our counterfactual growth path is simulated with a standard neoclassical model closure involving ( 1 ) price clearing of all goods and factor markets , ( 2 ) real exchange rate clearing the Balance of payments , and ( 3 ) investment is savings - driven . In addition , the counterfactual growth path are simulated with balanced macro - closure which ensures that the government consumption share of domestic absorption is fixed along the counterfactual growth path . The unmitigated C19 baseline scenario is , similarly , simulated with a standard neoclassical macro closure , but government consumption is ‘fixed’ at the counterfactual growth path ( in terms of its own price deflator ) and the simulations also involve a standard revenue - neutral government budget closure ( household direct taxes specified as endogenous , in order to compensate for shocks to government expenditures ) . The macroeconomic closures of the policy scenarios are slightly different involving separate closures for the individual BC - NPI , SC - NPI and HQ - NPI scenario components . The SC - NPI and HQ - NPI scenario components are simulated with a standard neoclassical model closure , whereas the BC - NPI component of the scenarios are simulated with a modified neoclassical model closure where factor demands are fixed ( and reduced ) in non - essential production sectors ( with sector - specific factor prices clearing sector - specific factor demands ) , while uniformly varying factor prices continue to clear factor markets among essential production sectors . Otherwise , all policy scenario NPI .

C . 3 Macroeconomic literature review The macroeconomic C19 literature generally focuses on C19 as a health shock with economic repercussions ( 1 ) directly via health - related impacts and ( 2 ) indirectly via private and public mitigating actions . Broadly speaking , the literature distinguishes between direct and indirect economic impacts , supply and demand shocks , private behaviour and public policy responses , emergency and recovery policy measures , pharmaceutical interventions ( PIs ) and NPIs , mitigation and suppression interventions , and a host of other focus areas . Research into the economics of C19 has , to a large degree , focused more on high - income countries ( HICs ) than on low - and middle - income countries ( LMICs ) . However , some comprehensive monographs have emerged covering both global , HIC and LMIC perspectives ( Baldwin & di Mauro 2020 ) , and economists from international institutions have attempted to summarize the limitations which LMICs are facing in terms of structural limitations and potential policy options going forward ( Loaysa & Pennings 2020 ) . A number of macroeconomic studies have emerged which focuses on combined epidemiological and macroeconomic modelling of the Covid - 19 illness and aggregate Covid - 19 NPI policy shocks . The group of aggregate Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium ( DSGE ) model studies , with endogenous epidemiological models , is focussed on aggregate social planning problems and optimal control strategies . In contrast , simple single - country fixed - price general equilibrium Multiplier Model ( MM ) studies , and more elaborate single - country and global Computable General Equilibrium ( CGE ) studies , are focussed on more detailed economic burden and NPI policy assessments ; and , for one of the CGE studies ( Keogh - Brown et al 2020 ) and one epidemiological - MM type model framework ( Haw et al 2020a , 2020b ) , focus is also on detailed epidemiological modelling of clinical health outcomes . The two groups of macroeconomic modelling studies are described in the following . Macroeconomic Social Planning DSGE studies The group of aggregate DSGE intertemporal model studies employ simple but fully integrated SIR - type epidemiological models ( Atkeson 2020a , 2020b ) . They also specify explicit social planning problems and use these to measure optimal lockdown strategies for minimizing macroeconomic and .

T he DSGE studies’ optimal strategies , typically , turn out to , essentially , analyse optimal strategies for keeping case fatalities low . Hence , their social planning problems , which have an infinite time horizon , are typically dominated by case fatalities’ lo ss of lifetime earnings , compared to which recovered individuals’ morbidity - related loss of earnings are small . The highly aggregated nature of DSGE model applications has several drawbacks . Hence , most DSGE studies rely on simplified economic specifications , including limited sector - level detail and simplified economic production specifications with labour as only production factor ( Alvarez , Argente & Lippi 2020 ; Eichenbaum , Trebelo & Trabandt 2020 ; Jones , Philippon & Venkateswaran 2020a , 2020b ) , and simplistic SIR epidemiological model specifications ( Atkeson 2020a , 2020b ) . While the integrated epidemiological model , in one case , accounts for variation in ‘meeting’ rates between work , consumption ( presumably a proxy for home contacts ) , and other meetings ( Eichenbaum , Trebelo & Trabandt 2020 ) , they generally lack nuanced socioeconomic policy scenario specifications of lockdown strategies ( typically focusing on the BC - NPI aspect of lockdown strategies , but missing key distinctions between essential and non - essential sectors , and also missing nuances of school closures , home quarantines , etc . ) The DSGE studies also typically lack epidemiological modelling of age - specific heterogeneity both in terms of contact patterns and clinical health outcomes , and private agents are assumed homogenous thereby disregarding the potentially catastrophic ( distributional ) income losses likely to be experienced by part of the population especially in LMICs . The optimal social planning problems also don’t account for other non - monetary ( health ) outcomes , e . g . mental health impacts of lockdown measures and timely hospital treatment of non - C19 patients , and their application of widely varying Value of Statistical Life ( VSL ) measures of mortality - related welfare losses presents an additional weakness , with magnitudes ranging from 20xGDPcap ( Alvarez , Argente & Lippi 2020 ) to estimates in the order of 140xGDPcap ( Jones , Philippon & Venkateswaran 2020a , 2020b ) . A key strength of the social planning DSGE approach is that it has managed to explicitly model private prevention behaviour , as part of the social planner’s problem , and to model two key externalities related to private behaviour : ( 1 ) the infection externality ( each individual only focussed on own protection without considering impact on society protection leading to undersupply of transmission - reducing behavioural change ) , and ( 2 ) the health system congestion externality ( each individual not taking risk of HS congestion , and associated excess mortality , into account , again leading to undersupply of transmission - reducing behavioural change ) .

Another strength of the social planning DSGE studies is that they have managed to analyse important issues such as tele - working . Some of the social planning analyses suggest that optimal tele - working ( if possible ) could approach 40 % ( Jones , Philippon & Venkateswaran 2020 ) , and , since the potential for tele - working has been measured to be approx . 37 % of all ( US ) jobs ( Dingel & Neyman 2020 ) , this provides an indication of the significant scope for mitigating tele - working interventions to contribute to epidemic control in countries where this is an option . While opportunities for tele - working may be more limited for Pakistan and other LMICs , the above results are suggestive , and e . g . large - scall tele - schooling initiatives have also been rolled - out in Pakistan and elsewhere ( see discussion below ) . Macroeconomic Burden Assessment CGE studies The CGE model studies of aggregate C19 shocks , currently in the public domain , includes application of a dynamically - recursive version of the “Standard Model” single - country CGE model framework ( Keogh - Brown et al 2020 ) , and applications of various global model frameworks , including the G - Cubed model developed by Warwick McKibbin and colleagues ( McKibbin & Fernando 2020 ) and the ImpactECON Supply - Chain Model which is a modified version of the Global Trade Analysis Project ( GTAP ) model ( Walmsley , Rose & Wei 2020 ) . While the GTAP - inspired ImpactECON Supply - Chain Model is a standard CGE model , the G - Cubed model is a hybrid DSGE / CGE model with aggregate intertemporal DSGE features but with an underlying multi - sector CGE model which solves for annual equilibria over a very long time horizon ( currently 2015 - 2100 ) . The intertemporal features of the G - Cubed model , including long - term budget constraints , makes it suitable for long - term policy analyses , while the CGE features allows for appropriate short - to medium - term analyses . The G - Cubed model , is , however , a bespoke and very data - intensive model , and therefore not useful as a basis for country - specific applications . Among the global studies , Walmsley et al employs a fairly simplistic specification of shocks , including only mandatory BC - NPIs of one and four month durations , while McKibbin and Fernando , in spite of being published very early ( 29 February 2020 ) and using scant data including 2003 SARS data from China and rough indicators for inferring country - specific shocks , goes much further and designs global sets of sophisticated country - specific scenarios involving direct and indirect health - related shocks ( morbidity and mortality - related labour force impacts ) , equity risk premia , sector - specific .

While neither the health - related impact focussed McKibbin - study or the NPI - focussed Walmsley - study have managed to successfully predict ( or properly model the full range of mechanisms underlying ) economic C19 impacts over 2020 , it is interesting to note ( 1 ) the McKibbin - study findings that “Hong Kong Flu” - and “Spanish Flu” - type pandemics would lead to health - related costs equivalent to respectively 2 % and 8 % declines in global GDP ( $ 2 . 3 & $ 9 . 2 trillion ) , and ( 2 ) the Walmsley - study predictions of four months of business closures leading to a 21 . 6 % decline of U . S . GDP ( $ 4 . 6 trillion ) and a 23 . 0 % drop in employment ( 36 . 1 million unemployed workers ) . While neither of these studies’ health - related or NPI intervention scenarios matched what actually happened during 2020 , they do suggest possible orders of magnitudes of ( 1 ) health - related costs if no NPI interventions had been undertaken , and ( 2 ) NPI costs if comprehensive BC - NPIs had been implemented without attempts to introduce either substitute NPIs ( e . g . SC - NPIs , HQ - NPIs , and GG - NPIs ) or complementary NPI interventions to lower BC - NPI impacts ( e . g . tele - working ) . In this sense , these early global studies underline the critically important point , that , while business closures can affect contact numbers at work , BC - NPIs are extremely costly to society , and , if alternative NPI measures aren’t effectively implemented and managed ( e . g . throu gh communication campaigns from trusted authorities ) , epidemic control may , in the absence of effective PIs , be very costly to society . Using the same “Standard Model” single - country methodology as the current study ( see Methods section below ) , a UK single - country study analysed C19 lockdown scenarios with a broader scope of NPI interventions involving both BC - NPIs , SC - NPIs , and HQ - NPI components ( Keogh - Brown et al 2020 ) . The UK CGE model was specified to mimic the detailed epidemiological predictions of the widely recognized Imperial College model for the UK , including modelling of their preferred intermittent 2 - month lockdown / 1 - month opening - up scenario ( Ferguson , Laydon et al . 2020 ) . The business closure component was , however , not analysed with complementary interventions , e . g . tele - working , and simulated magnitudes of economic costs of NPIs , necessary to control the UK epidemic , were therefore on a par with the global Walmsley - study ( essentially , predicted economic impacts could be viewed as a worst - case scenario ) . A key strength of the single country CGE framework , in a health context , is its ability to accommodate exogenous epidemiological model predictions , and thereby allow for model - consistent public health assessments of actual monetary policy impacts and economic burdens .

Hence , the focus on analysing policy scenarios , rather than specifying social planning problems , allow decisions on trade - offs to be left up to policy makers – and , by the same token , policymakers are free to apply their own preferences when they weigh relative economic and clinical health impacts from various NPI policy scenarios . Turning to the C19 applications of MM models , also known as fixed - price general equilibrium models , they have been applied , mostly by IFPRI - researchers and their peers , to assess potential economic impacts of C19 epidemics across a range of developing countries including Ghana ( Amewu et al 2020 ) , Nigeria ( Andam et al 2020 ) , Ethiopia ( Aragie , Taffesse & Thurlow 2020 ) , South Africa ( Arndt et al 2020 ) , Myanmar ( Diao et al 2020 ) , and Indonesia ( Pradesha et al 2020 ) . Within the MM model literature , a distinction is typically drawn between ( 1 ) Leontieff MM models ( endogenous accounts only including production activity and retail commodity accounts ) , and ( 2 ) SAM MM models ( endogenous accounts typically also including factor , enterprise and private household accounts , in order to allow for endogenous income - feedback loops via private consumption ) . The key motivation for applying the MM methodology , in the context of the C19 epidemic , seems to have been to derive very short - term impacts given that the shocks analysed are “…working through the economy in weeks or months…” ( Diao et al 2020 ) , and the authors further underline their point by saying that “ ( T ) he SAM multiplier mo del is a simulation tool suited to measuring short - term direct and indirect economy - wide impacts of unanticipated , rapid - onset economic shocks , such as COVID - 19” ( ibid . ) Another study adds that it is the unconstrained MM methodology which is applied ( Andam et al 2020 ) , something which seems to be implicitly assumed in the other IFPRI - studies . In terms of MM model closure specifications , one IFPRI - study simply states that “ ( T ) he SAM - multiplier model deployed treats the elements of final demand ( household consumption , investment , government expenditure , and exports ) as exogenous variables that can be ‘shocked’” without further motivation ( Arndt et al 2020 ) , while another explains that , beyond other final demand components , the model “…also treats household consumption demand as exogenous , meaning that an income shock does not result in subsequent rounds of consumption demand and income feedbacks . This avoids over - estimating multiplier effects…” ( Andam et al 2020 ) . As noted above , this is a non - standard SAM MM model closure . It can also be noted that economic multipliers , derived from MM models , have no time dimension . The multiplier formula 𝑀 = ( 𝐼 − 𝐴 ) −1 = 𝐴 + 𝐴 2 + ⋯ + 𝐴 𝑛 + ⋯ indicates that ( Leotieff and SAM ) multipliers , in fact , are the result of an infinite number of economic feedback - loops , but since these loops do not have a time dimension , it is not possible to attach a specific time dimension to the multipliers .

This is however not the case . The IFPRI - studies’ model closure implies that Leontieff multipliers , with their narrow focus on intermediate demand - feedback loops , are driving their multiplier results , and since these multipliers are also the results of infinite numbers of iterations , it is still not clear that the IFPRI - studies’ multipliers can appropriately be given a very short - term interpretation . Another weakness of the IFPRI MM model approach is that MM models assume linear production technologies and fixed prices ( Andam et al 2020 ) , and , while it is argued that CGE models are inappropriate for analyzing C19 lockdowns “…where trade and production have ceased due to government directives , rather than by market forces…” and that MM models , by default , are preferred ( ibid . ) , the implicit factor market closure for the unconstrained MM model , i . e . excess supplies of factor resources ( including capital ) , is unrealistic for most LMICs . In fact , while many of the IFPRI - studies was admittedly written during the early stages of the pandemic and therefore hasn’t been able to benefit from knowing how LMIC policy responses have unfolded during 2020 , the reality of C19 policy responses in most LMICs , perhaps with the exception of South Africa , has been , that hard business lockdowns have been avoided , or , if attempted , they have quickly been substituted for softer ‘smart’ lockdown strategies . This switch in strategy towards smart lockdowns was made , exactly to avoid the catastrophic poor informal sector household income loss scenarios which several IFPRI - studies points out would have been the result of such lockdowns . As such , the IFPRI MM model impacts , same as the excessive CGE model impacts referred to above , can be considered as worst - case NPI costs . Also , the fact that hard lockdowns has been the exception in LMICs , invalidates the key argument that “…trade and production have ceased…” Hence , as argued above , most country responses to C19 have gone to great pain to focus on reducing other contact numbers before resorting to BC - NPIs , and , when resorting to “last resort” BC - NPIs , they have typically been partial and targeted at hospitality sectors with particularly high contact numbers . With this in mind , and also considering that LMICs , including Pakistan , have focused on smart lockdowns in order to allow their ( informal ) service sector to continue to operate , it is reasonable to assume that price adjustment has continued to play a key role in resource allocation in most LMICs , and that CGE models therefore remains an appropriate tool even in the face of multiple simultaneous demand - side shocks and supply - side NPI policy restrictions . .

The implicit MM model closure implicitly assumes that final demand is the restricting factor , while , as mentioned above , supply - side resources , including labour and capital factor supplies , are freely available to adjust . While uncertainty , created by national C19 epidemics , are bound to have impacted domestic final demand components , this model closure is not consistent with modelling of , essentially , supply - side lockdown interventions which closes factor capital equipment down and reduces effective labour force participation rates . In spite of the above - mentioned drawbacks , it should be noted that a key strength of the IFPRI MM Model applications is that they build on economywide SAM data sets , and , while economic data from LMICs has become much more accessible with the proliferation of economic survey data since the early 1970s ( Thorbecke 2000 ) , SAM data sets continue to provide almost unrivalled access to economy - wide policy analysis in many developing countries . And , with the simplicity of the SAM MM methodology , this has allowed for quick access to ( simple , but timely and policy - relevant ) policy analyses to inform policy makers in LMICs . Finally , it should be mentioned that Imperial College has established an epidemiological - MM type model framework – a framework which is related to the macroeconomic social planning DSGE studies , discussed above , since this framework also consists of an epidemiological model coupled with a macroeconomic module . These frameworks are linked together by ( 1 ) spillovers from the epidemiological model to the macroeconomic model , and ( 2 ) a social planner objective function which , in this case , is real GDP ( Haw et al 2020a , 2020b ) . The Imperial framework is , however , distinguished , from the DSGE model frameworks , by a much more sophisticated approach to epidemiological modelling , but also by a rudimentary macroeconomic module , consisting , purely , of fixed sector - specific production vectors , which are scaled by sector - specific BC - NPI lockdown shares in order to compute linear variations in sector - level GDP , but which does not involve economic behaviour . .
