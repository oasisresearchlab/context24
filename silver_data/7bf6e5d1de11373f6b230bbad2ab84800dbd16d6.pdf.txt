Here we describe two classes of small molecules that bind to different sites on the Arp2 / 3 complex and inhibit its ability to nucleate actin filaments .

Two inhibitors with different mechanisms of action provide a powerful approach for studying the Arp2 / 3 complex in living cells . We used fluorescence assays to screen a library of . 400 , 000 small molecules for inhibitors of actin polymerization stimulated by human ( Homo sapiens , Hs ) Arp2 / 3 complex and either full - length human Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( HsWASP ) with acrylodan - actin or HsWASP residues 105 – 502 with pyrenyl - actin . These screens each identified two inhibitors of human and bovine ( Bos taurus , Bt ) Arp2 / 3 complex , namely CK - 0944636 ( abbreviated CK - 636 ) and CK - 0993548 ( abbreviated CK - 548 ) ( Fig . 1a ) . These compounds inhibited BtArp2 / 3 complex with IC 50 ( half - maximal inhibitory concentration ) values of 32 m M for CK - 636 and 11 m M for CK - 548 ( Fig . 1c ) . CK - 636 inhibited actin polymerization stimulated by fission yeast ( Schizosaccharomyces pombe , Sp ) Arp2 / 3 complex ( IC 50 5 24 m M ) , but 100 m M CK - 548 did not ( Fig . 1c , Supplementary Table 1 ) . Fluorescence microscopy of the products of these reactions stained with Alexa 488 phalloidin showed branched actin filaments in controls ( Fig . 1e , left panel ) . Samples with 100 m M CK - 636 contained fewer branched filaments ( Fig . 1e , centre panel ) , whilesampleswith100 m MCK - 548containedonlyunbranched filaments ( Fig . 1e , right panel ) .

Supplementary Table 2 lists one inactive compound from each class . The following control experiments showed that both compounds interact with Arp2 / 3 complex rather than actin or WASP . At 20 m M , neither compound inhibited polymerization of actin alone or polymerization stimulated by the FH2 domain of formin Cdc12p ( Cdc12 ( FH2 ) ; Fig . 1b ) , so neither compound interacts directly with actin . Asactincanpolymerizeonitsown , neithercompoundeliminated actin polymerization in mixtures with Arp2 / 3 complex and WASP or a carboxy - terminal construct of Neural Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( N - WASP - VCA ) ( Fig . 1c , d ) . Both compounds inhibited poly - merization stimulated by HsArp2 / 3 complex and ActA , an Arp2 / 3 complex activating factor from Listeria monocytogenes 2 , suggesting that theydonotactonWASP ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Afluorescenceaniso - tropy assay showed that neither compound had a large effect on Arp2 / 3 complex binding N - WASP - VCA ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . The affinity of rhodamine - N - WASP - VCA for BtArp2 / 3complex was the same with 50 m M CK - 636 ( K d 5 470 6 50nM ) as controls ( K d 5 510 6 30nM ) , but 50 m M CK - 548 decreased the affinity approximately twofold ( K d 5 1 . 0 6 0 . 2 m M ) . Weuseda Listeria motility assay to determine whether CK - 636and CK - 548 can inhibit actin polymerization mediated by Arp2 / 3 com - plex in live cells . Both compounds reduced the formation of actin filament comet tails by Listeria in infected SKOV3 cells ( Fig . 2a – c ) . The concentration dependence of this inhibition gave IC 50 values of 22 m M for CK - 636 and 31 m M for CK - 548 . We used the actin poly - merization and Listeria comet tail assays to search for more potent inhibitors related to CK - 636 and CK - 548 . CompoundCK - 0944666 ( abbreviatedCK - 666 ) hasafluorobenzene ratherthanthethiopheneringofCK - 636 ( Fig . 1a ) . CK - 666wasabetter inhibitor of actin polymerization with either BtArp2 / 3 complex ( IC 50 5 32 m M for CK - 636 verses 17 m M for CK - 666 ) or SpArp2 / 3 complex ( IC 50 5 24 m M for CK - 636 versus 5 m M for CK - 666 ) ( Fig . 1d , Supplementary Table 1 ) . Both CK - 636 and CK - 666 had IC 50 values of 4 m M for inhibiting HsArp2 / 3complex . CK - 666 reduced actin polymerization around intracellular Listeria to background levels ( Fig . 2d , e and g ) at lower concentrations than CK - 636 ( Fig . 2c ) . Actin filament haloes and comet tails reformed when the compounds were removed after one hour of treatment ( Fig . 2f , g ) . Inactive control compound CK - 689 had no effect on comet tail formation ( Fig . 2g ) . CK - 0157869 ( abbreviated CK - 869 ) has methoxy groups in the ortho and para positions replacing the ortho - hydroxy and meta - chlorine substituents of CK - 548 ( Fig . 1a ) . CK - 869 inhibited actin polymerization with BtArp2 / 3 complex similarly to CK - 548 ( IC 50 5 11 m M for both compounds ) , but CK869 inhibited comet tail formation by Listeria more effectively ( IC 50 5 7 m M for CK - 869 versus 31 m M for CK - 548 ) . Like CK - 548 , CK - 869 did not inhibit either budding or fission yeast Arp2 / 3 complexes ( Fig . 1d ) . Both CK - 548 and CK - 636 also inhibited the formation of podo - somes by the THP - 1 monocyte cell line ( Fig . 2h – k ) . Podosomes are adhesive structures that depend on Arp2 / 3 complex , WASP and actin polymerization 3 . Podosomes also depend on microtubules 4 , but neither CK - 548 or CK - 636 at 100 m M disrupted the microtubule network in THP - 1 cells ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) .

All rights reserved ©2009 potent compound , CK - 666 , had no effect on the mitotic index of SKOV cells at concentrations up to 80 m M , while inhibiting actin assembly around Listeria completely at 10 m M . Fifty micromolar CK - 666 or CK - 869 each altered the morphology and slightly slowed but did not stop the gliding motility of fish keratocytes ( data not shown ) , as expected , as , 10 % of Arp2 / 3 complex ( , 500nM ) would still be active . Thus Listeria comet tails and monocyte podosomes are more sensitivethan lamellarmotility toinhibition of Arp2 / 3complex . We determined X - ray crystal structures of BtArp2 / 3 complex with either CK - 636 or CK - 548 bound , using molecular replacement with the apo - form BtArp2 / 3 complex as the search model ( PDB accession 1K8K ) 5 . Structures of Arp2 / 3 complex co - crystallized with the com - pounds and with compounds soaked into the crystals were nearly identical , but the resolution of soaked crystals was higher ( 2 . 70 A˚ for CK - 636 and 2 . 85 A˚ for CK - 548 , Supplementary Table 3 ) . As in previous crystal structures of BtArp2 / 3 complex 5 – 7 , none of these structures had appreciable electron density for subdomains 1 and 2 of Arp2 , which appears only after chemical crosslinking 7 . After one round of rigid body refinement , strong F o 2 F c electron density was present at the interface between Arp2 and Arp3 in maps calculated with data from crystals soaked in 1 mM CK - 636 ( Fig . 3 ) . Thisdensityimprovedonfurtherrefinement ( SupplementaryFig . 4a ) , and CK - 636 was modelled into the density when the R f was 29 . 2 % . CK - 636 binds in a pocket between subdomain 4 of Arp2 and sub - domain 1 of Arp3 . The contact surface is mainly hydrophobic and buries 161A˚ 2 of the accessible surface of Arp2 and 79A˚ 2 of Arp3 . CK - 636 forms hydrogen bonds with two residues in the pocket . The side chain of Asp 248 forms a hydrogen bond with the nitrogen in the indole ring of the inhibitor , and the backbone amide of Ala203 forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen on the linker between the two ring systems . Both trans and cis conformations of the amide functional group of CK - 636 fit into the electron density with the hydrogen bonds described above preserved in both conformations . Because trans - amides are generally 1 – 5kcalmol 2 1 more stable than cis - amides in solution 8 , and the cis conformation is rarely observed in small molecules , we modelled CK - 636 in the trans conformation . A difference electron density map shows that CK - 636 causes minor conformational changes in the complex ( Fig . 3b ) . Arp2 Arg 250 from b - strand 13 rotates out of the pocket and adopts an extended con - formation . Arp2 Ala 203 from the loop ( residues 199 – 208 ) connect - ing a - helices a E and a F moves towards the pocket , causing the side chain of Leu 198 to adopt a new rotamer . These changes and small changes in the backbone of residues surrounding the pocket result in an overall r . m . s . deviation of 0 . 63 A˚ for an overlay of subdomains 3 and 4 ( 191 C a atoms ) of Arp2 with and without inhibitor bound . We modelled CK - 666 into the CK - 636 binding pocket with the aromatic fluorine pointed towards a concave surface in the back wall of the pocket formed by Tyr202 in Arp2 and residues 118 to 120 in Arp3 ( SupplementaryFig . 6 ) . One hundredstepsofconjugate gradient minimization in CNS 9 showed that CK - 666 is stable in this conforma - tion and does not clash with residues in the pocket . The fluorine atom providesadditionalvanderWaalsinteractionswiththebackwallofthepocket , and the benzene ring completely fills the hydrophobic pocket created by Ile252 , Tyr202 and the aliphatic portion of Thr119 . These interactions may allow CK - 666 to bind more tightly than CK - 636 . DuringformationofabranchArp2moves31A˚relativetoArp3from its position in inactive Arp2 / 3 complex 10 , so the location of the CK - 636 binding pocket between Arp2 and Arp3 suggests that CK - 636 and CK - 666 lock Arp2 / 3 complex in an inactive conformation . CK - 636 at a concentration of 100 m M did not interfere with N - WASP - VCA binding to Arp2 / 3 complex ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) , but it prevented WASP - VCA binding from increasing the fluorescence of Arp2 / 3 complex loaded with etheno - ATP ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . ThusCK - 636 inhibits aconformationalchangecausedbyactivatorbinding . Thissupportsthe hypothesis that CK - 636 locks thecomplex in an inactive conformation . The residues contributed by Arp2 and Arp3 to form the CK - 636 binding pocket are conserved across a broad range of species ( Supplementary Table 4 ) , so we expect CK - 636 and CK - 666 will be useful for inhibiting Arp2 / 3 complex from diverse species . These residues are also conserved in actin , but CK - 636 does not inhibit actin polymerization at concentrations up to 200 m M . Only half of the binding site is available on an actin monomer , and the two half - sites are not juxtaposed in actin filaments 11 . CK - 548 has a single stereocentre and was used as a racemic mixture in our experiments . The 2S enantiomer binds in a hydrophobic cavity in the core of the Arp3 subunit ( Fig . 4a , b and Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . The isolated 2R enantiomer , which does not fit in the binding pocket , should provide a useful control for in vivo experiments . Binding of CK - 548 requires a substantial conformational change : the loop ( resi - dues76 – 85 ) connecting b 6 ( 73 – 75 ) and a B ( 86 – 98 ) insubdomain1of Arp3 flips upward 7 . 2A˚ , exposing the binding site in the hydrophobic core of Arp3 ( Fig . 4b , c ) . CK - 548 contacts 239A˚ 2 of the inner surface of this cavity , which includes residues Cys12 , Ile 78 , Trp86 , Met89 , Met93andLeu112 . Ahydrogenbondbetweenthesidechainamideof Asn118 and the carbonyl oxygen of CK - 548 anchors the inhibitor to the loop between b 7 ( 110 – 114 ) and a C ( 120 – 132 ) , which forms the bottom lip of the cavity . The ability of CK - 548 to bind crystallized Arp2 / 3 complex suggests that the b 6 / a B loop can open the hydro - phobic binding pocket both in crystals and in solution , even in the absenceof inhibitor . TheaverageB - factor forallresidues in theloop is 63A ˚ 2 in theclosedconformation and 82A˚ 2 in theopen conformation , suggesting that the loop is more flexible when open . When modelled into the CK - 548 binding site , the para - methoxy group of CK - 869 projects towards the upper lip of the pocket and is sandwiched by the side chains of Ile 78 , Glu 84 and Met 89 ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . The ortho - methoxy group points towards a crease formed at the ends of strands b 1 and b 7 , which could be exploited to design higher affinity inhibitors . Both CK - 548 and CK - 869 inhibited human and bovine Arp2 / 3 complexes , but neither inhibited budding or fission yeast Arp2 / 3 a b α F α E β 12 β 13 Figure 3 | Crystal structure of BtArp2 / 3 complex with bound CK - 636 .

The residues that contact CK - 548are conserved in Arp2 / 3 complexes of most mammals , but tryptophan replaces Met93atthebackoftheCK - 548bindingpocketinmanyotherspecies , includingbuddingandfissionyeast ( SupplementaryTable5 ) . Thebent side chain of Met93 allows CK - 548 to bind , but tryptophan at this position blocks binding to non - mammalian Arp3 and actin . The mechanism of action of CK - 548 / 869 is less apparent than that of CK - 636 / 666 . A fluorescence anisotropy assay showed that CK - 548 decreased the affinity of rhodamine - labelled N - WASP - VCA for Arp2 / 3 complex twofold , but this should be inconsequential under the conditions of our assay ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . The conforma - tion induced by CK - 548 / 869 must interfere with one or more of the reactions along the pathway to branch formation , such as binding of the pointed end of Arp3 to a mother filament 10 , nucleotide binding to Arp3 , or conformational changes that activate branch formation .

Human , bovine and S . pombe Arp2 / 3 complexes were purified as previously described 11 , 12 , 20 . S . cerevisiae Arp2 / 3 complex was purified from strain BN020 ( MAT a or a , ura3 - 52 , his3 - 200 , leu2 - 3 , lys2 - 801 , trp1 - 1 , D arp2 : : TRP1 , D arp3 : : HIS , [ pRS315 - Arp3 ] , [ pRS317 - ARP2 ] ) . Cultures were grown overnight at 30 u C to A 600 5 1 and pelleted by centrifuging at 5 , 000 g for 8min . Cellswerewashedinlysis buffer ( 20mMTrispH8 . 0 , 50mMNaCl , 1mM EDTA ) and pelleted . The pellet was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 2 80 u C . Cells were thawed and 1ml lysis buffer was added per g wet cell pellet . Protease inhibitor tablets ( Sigma ) were added ( one tablet per 100ml cell sus - pension ) and cells were lysed by five passes at 30 , 000p . s . i . on a model 110EH microfluidizer ( Microfluidics ) . Thelysatewasspunat30 , 000 g for20minandthe supernatantwas collectedandcentrifugedfor 1h 15minat 125 , 000 g . Thesuper - natantwasfilteredthroughcheeseclothandproteinswereprecipitatedwith50 % saturated aqueous ( NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 . Pelleted proteins were resuspended in 50ml of PKME ( 25mM PIPES pH 7 . 0 , 50mM KCl , 1mM EGTA , 3mM MgCl 2 , 1mM EGTA , 1mM DTT and 0 . 1mM ATP ) and dialysed against the same buffer overnight . The dialysate was purified on a GST - N - WASP - VCA affinity column , and Arp2 / 3 complex - containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to 1ml before loading onto a Superdex200 gel filtration column ( GE Healthcare ) equi - libratedin20mMTrispH8 . 0and100mMNaCl . Peakfractionswerepooledand concentrated to approximately 10 – 20 m M , flash - frozen in liquid nitrogen , and storedat 2 80 u C . BovineN - WASP - VCAwasconstructedbyamplifyingresidues 428 – 505 from pGEX - 2T - NWASP - VCA ( a gift of H . Higgs ) and cloning into pGV67 using BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites . This vector was used to trans - form E . coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) . N - WASP - VCA was expressed and purified as previously described 11 . Chicken skeletal muscle was purified and labelled with pyrene iodoacetamide 21 . Recombinant full length human WASP was purified from 293 cells and recombinant human WASP ( residues 105 – 502 ) was purified from E . coli for the initial screens with HsArp2 / 3 complex . Recombinant Listeria ActA residues 36 – 170 were expressed as an N - terminal GST fusion and purified from E . coli . S . pombe formin Cdc12 ( FH2 ) domain ( residues 973 – 1390 , abbre - viated Cdc12 ( FH2 ) in text ) was purified from E . coli . Actin polymerization assay . We measured the nucleation activity of Arp2 / 3 complexfromthetimecourseofactinpolymerization . Polymerizationreactions of 100 m l were assembled as previously described 12 and fluorescence measure - ments were made at 8s intervals in a 96 - well plate using a Gemini XPS spectro - fluorimeter ( MolecularDevices ) withanexcitationwavelengthof365nmandan emission wavelength of 407nM . The rate of polymerization at each time point was determined by calculating the slope in five - point intervals and multiplying by [ total polymer ] / D RFU , where [ total polymer ] is the total actin minus the critical concentration ( 0 . 1 m M ) and D RFU is the difference in relative fluor - escence units of the reaction upon completion ( RFU max ) and the initial reaction mix ( RFU min ) . We plotted the maximum elongation rate ( R ) verses inhibitor concentration ( [ I ] ) and fitted the curve using the equation : R ~ R max { R max { R min ð Þ 1 z IC 50 = I ½ (cid:1) 2 4 3 5 Here R max is the maximum rate of elongation with Arp2 / 3 complex and no inhibitors and R min is the maximum rate of elongation of actin alone . The products of polymerization reactions were diluted into Alexa 488 - phalloidin and observed by fluorescence microscopy 16 . Fluorescence anisotropy . The endogenous cysteine ( Cys431 ) near the end of the amino terminus in purified N - WASP - VCA was labelled with rhodamine maleimide 12 . Fixed concentrations of Rho - N - WASP - VCA were titrated with BtArp2 / 3 complex and the fluorescence anisotropy measured 12 . Binding constants were determined by fitting the anisotropy curves to the following equation : r ~ r f z ( r b { r f ) ( K d z ½ R (cid:1) z ½ L (cid:1) ) { ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ( K d z ½ R (cid:1) z ½ L (cid:1) ) 2 { 4 ½ R (cid:1)½ L (cid:1) q 2 ½ L (cid:1) 0 @ 1 A where r f isthesignalofthefreereceptor ( R ) , r b isthesignaloftheboundreceptor , and [ L ] is the total concentration of the ligand ( species titrated ) . r b and K d were fitted using Kaleidagraph ( Synergy Software ) . Etheno - ATP fluorescent assay . Binding of etheno - ATP to Arp2 / 3 complex was performed as described previously with slight modifications 17 , 18 . Human Arp2 / 3 complex ( 0 . 7 m M ) was incubated with 2 . 5 m M etheno - ATP , 0 . 2M acylamide ( used as an etheno - ATP fluorescence quencher ) in 2mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 50mM KCl , 0 . 05mM EGTA 0 . 8mM MgCl 2 , 0 and 0 . 5mM DTT . Ethano - ATP emission spectra were acquired upon excitation at 340nm using spectrofluo - rometer FluoroMax ( Horiba JY ) . Inhibition of Arp2 / 3 complex by 100 m M CK - 636 was performed in the presence or absence of 2 . 8 m M WASP - VCA . Listeria comet , motility and podosome assays . SKOV3 , THP - 1 and L . mono - cytogenes ( ATCC 984 ) cells were from ATCC . SKOV3 cells were cultured in RPMI with5 % FBSwithoutantibioticat37 u Cand5 % CO 2 . Listeria weregrowninshaking culture in brain heart infusion ( Difco Inc . , DF0037 - 15 ) at 37 u C . SKOV3 cells were infected with L . monocytogenes , incubated for 90min and then treated for 60min with either compound dissolved in DMSO or a DMSO control before fixing with 2 % formaldehyde . Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton - X in PBS at roomtemperature for 15min and reactedwith a 1 : 200 dilution of Listeria antibody ( USBiologics ) inPBSfor60minatroomtemperature . Antibodywasremovedand cells were stained with a 1 : 100 dilution of Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin and a 1 : 400 dilutionAlexaFluor488goatanti - rabbitsecondaryantibody ( bothfromMolecular Probes ) for 60min at room temperature . After washing , cells were imaged at 20 3 with an Axon Instruments automated fluorescence microscope system ( Molecular Devices ) . The THP - 1 monocyte cell line was grown in RPMI with 10 % FBS / 2mM L - glutamine , differentiated in 50nM phorbol myristate acetate ( Sigma - Aldrich Fluka ) for 48h at 37 u C , trypsinized and plated at 5 3 10 5 cellsml 2 1 in black Nuncglass - bottom96 - wellplates . Afterincubationat37 u Cfor2h , cellsweretreated with compounds for 15min before fixing and staining with Alexa Fluor 568 phal - loidin and DAPI ( Sigma - Aldrich Fluka ) as above .

Crystals of BtArp2 / 3 complex were grown at 4 u C using the hanging drop vapour diffusion method as previously described 7 . Crystals were soaked for 24h in 18 % polyethylene glycol 8000 , 50mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 100mM potassium thiocyanate , 20 % glycerol and either 0 . 5mM CK - 548 or 1mM CK - 636 in DMSO before freezing in liquid nitrogen . Data were collected at beamline X29A at Brookhaven National laboratories and processed with HKL2000 22 . To generate initial models , protein atoms from 1K8K were refined against the data using 30 cycles of minimization in which each subunit was allowed to move as a separate rigid body . CK - 548 structure was refined in Refmac 23 with topology files generated in ccp4i sketcher . The CK - 636 structure was refined in CNS 8 using topology files generated with the prodrg server 24 . 20 . Higgs , H . N . , Blanchoin , L . & Pollard , T . D .
