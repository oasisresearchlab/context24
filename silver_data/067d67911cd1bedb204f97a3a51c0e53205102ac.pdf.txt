Although TfR is widely believed to be important for iron acquisition by all mammalian cells , direct experimental evidence is lacking . We have previously shown that mouse embryos homozygous for a disrupted transferrin receptor allele ( TfR - / - ) die of anemia before embryonic day 12 . 5 , although most other embryonic tissues appear to be developing normally . Here , we have investigated the importance of TfR postnatally , by using TfR - / - embryonic stem cells to produce chimeric animals . We find that TfR - / - embryonic stem cells give rise to most tissues and organs , but do not contribute to hematopoietic tissues on a wild type C57BL / 6J background , indicating that both adult erythropoiesis and lymphopoiesis require TfR . On an immunodeficient RAG2 - / - background , TfR - / - B cell development proceeds at least to the IgM + stage , although there are significantly fewer IgM + cells in peripheral lymphoid organs . Conversely , T cells lacking TfR are arrested very early in their development , at the CD4 - 8 - 3 - stage . These results indicate that TfR is necessary for the normal maturation of thymocytes , but that B cell development is less severely affected by the absence of TfR .

Its ligand , transferrin ( Tf ) , binds ferric iron with high affinity to solubilize it , render it non - reactive , and deliver it to cells . At the cell surface , holotransferrin ( Fe 2 - Tf ) binds to TfR and is internalized by receptor - mediated endocytosis . Fe dissociates from Tf within acidified endosomes and is transferred across the endosomal membrane by divalent metal transporter 1 ( DMT1 ; reviewed in ref . 1 ) . The apoTf - TfR complex is then recycled back to the cell surface . This process , termed the Tf cycle , is reiterated many times by each TfR and Tf molecule , providing a highly efficient mechanism for cellular iron uptake . The erythroid bone marrow requires an exceptionally large amount of iron to support the production of hemoglobin . However , other cells that are not actively dividing have minimal iron requirements . Accordingly , two mutant mouse strains , deficient in TfR or Tf , have revealed a critical role for the Tf cycle in erythropoiesis . Embryos lacking TfR appear to form non - hematopoietic tissues normally during early embryogenesis , but die from severe anemia at mid - gestation , indicating that they become dependent upon the Tf cycle prior to the onset of fetal liver hematopoiesis . 2 The fact that TfR - / - embryos can produce a substantial red cell mass until embryonic day 10 . 5 ( E10 . 5 ) suggests that TfR - independent mechanisms of iron uptake are adequate for the earliest erythropoiesis as well as for the initial formation of most tissues . Similarly , hypotransferrinemic ( Tf hpx / hpx ) animals are profoundly anemic due to an inactivating mutation within a splice donor site in the Tf gene . 3 They also appear to have normal For personal use only . on December 3 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From Ned et al . , page 4 development of most non - hematopoietic tissues . Tf hpx / hpx mice survive if they are given exogenous Tf or red blood cell transfusions soon after birth . 4 Interestingly , these animals develop systemic iron overload similar to human patients with atransferrinemia , 5 providing further evidence that the Tf cycle may be dispensable for the survival , proliferation and differentiation of many cell types . However , TfR - / - mice and Tf hpx / hpx mice show subtle abnormalities in neuroepithelial precursors 2 and central nervous system architecture , 6 respectively , indicating that the Tf cycle may be important for neuronal development . There are limitations to the conclusions that can be drawn from these studies of TfR - / - and Tf hpx / hpx mice . First , because TfR - / - embryos die between E10 . 5 and E12 . 5 , it is impossible to evaluate whether cells and tissues that have not yet developed require TfR . In particular , we were unable to determine whether TfR was necessary for definitive , adult erythropoiesis , for the development of other hematopoietic lineages , or for the formation of tissues that arise later in gestation . Second , although severely deficient in serum Tf , Tf hpx / hpx mice have a small amount of circulating , abnormal Tf that is likely to be functional . 3 Finally , it is possible that TfR has other roles , in addition to iron uptake , which do not require Tf and would not have been revealed in studies of Tf hpx / hpx mice . For these reasons , we sought an alternative approach to determining the importance of TfR in the formation of adult mouse tissues . We generated chimeric mice by introducing TfR - / - embryonic stem ( ES ) cells into wild type ( TfR + / + ) blastocysts . The blastocysts were allowed to develop , and chimeric mice were analyzed to determine which tissues contained descendants of the TfR - / - ES cells and which were exclusively derived from the TfR + / + host cells . Substantial contribution of TfR - / - ES cells to an For personal use only . on December 3 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From Ned et al . , page 5 organ or tissue indicated that TfR was not essential for the development of most or all of the cells of that tissue . Conversely , cell types and tissues that showed no contribution from TfR - / - ES cells must require TfR for their normal development . Similar to earlier studies of TfR - / - embryos and Tf hpx / hpx mice , we found that TfR - / - ES cells participated in the formation of most tissues . However , TfR - / - cells were notably missing from hematopoietic tissues including bone marrow , spleen and thymus . This suggested that TfR was not only necessary for normal erythropoiesis , but also for the proliferation and / or maturation of other hematopoietic cell types . We extended our studies of the role of TfR in T and B lymphopoiesis by producing chimeric mice on a RAG2 - / - background , since RAG2 - / - mice have an early block in the production of lymphocytes . We found that TfR - / - cells did not give rise to T cells beyond the triple negative ( CD4 - 8 - 3 - ) stage of development . However , B lymphoid cells that had undergone heavy chain gene rearrangement and matured to at least the IgM + stage of development were present in at least some of the TfR - / - chimeras . These results indicate that TfR is important in early lymphoid development , but differentially so . TfR may play a key role in the differentiation of T lymphoid precursor cells , in the expansion of early B and T lymphoid cell populations , or in both processes . MATERIALS AND METHODS Generation of TfR - / - ES cells Previously derived TfR + / - ES cells 2 were expanded on feeder layers of (cid:1) - irradiated embryonic fibroblasts in Dulbecco ' s Modified Eagle ' s Medium containing 4 . 5 g / L glucose supplemented For personal use only . on December 3 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From Ned et al . , page 6 with 15 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , 1 mM sodium pyruvate , 2 mM L - glutamine , 0 . 1 mM nonessential amino acids , 25 mM HEPES , 5 . 8 mM NaOH , 0 . 087 mM (cid:2) - mercaptoethanol , 200 U / ml penicillin G sodium , 200 µ g / ml streptomycin sulfate , and 10 4 units / ml leukemia inhibitory factor ( R & D Systems ) . To inactivate the remaining wild type TfR allele , TfR + / - cells were treated with 1 - 2 . 5 mg / ml G418 ( Gibco BRL ) as part of a " neomycin step - up " experiment 7 to select for cells that carried two copies of the targeted chromosome and had lost the chromosome carrying the normal TfR allele . Clones were isolated after 10 or 17 days of selection . Non - transferrin - bound iron was provided for the selected cells by supplementation with 50 µ M , 100 µ M or 150 µ M ferric salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone ( Fe - SIH , a gift from P . Ponka ) . Ninety clones were screened by PCR amplification of a microsatellite polymorphism that distinguishes between wild type and null TfR alleles as previously described . 2 Clones that appeared to be TfR - / - in this assay were confirmed by Southern blot analysis . 2 Two TfR - / - clones were obtained , both of which arose in cultures supplemented with 50 µ M Fe - SIH . Karyotype analysis showed that both clones had a normal complement of forty chromosomes . Because long - term maintenance in Fe - SIH appeared to be toxic to the cells , the clones were subsequently maintained with 20 µ g / ml ferric ammonium citrate as the iron source . Generation and analysis of C57BL / 6J chimeras Cells from each TfR - / - clone and control TfR + / - cells were microinjected into wild type C57BL / 6J blastocysts to produce chimeric mice . Chimeras and non - chimeric littermates were bled and tissues were harvested 4 - 6 weeks after birth . Blood was collected into heparinized capillary tubes . Hemoglobin electrophoresis was performed as described previously . 8 Isoelectric focusing was performed using standard techniques . Tissue DNA was prepared using the Puregene DNA For personal use only . on December 3 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From Ned et al . , page 7 Isolation Kit ( Gentra Systems , Inc . ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Samples ( 10 µ g ) were digested with NheI and subjected to Southern blot analysis to distinguish wild type and disrupted TfR alleles 2 , or analyzed by PCR as above . RAG2 - / - blastocyst complementation and flow cytometry For the first experiment , RAG2 - / - mice 9 were maintained in the barrier mouse facility at Children’s Hospital , Boston . TfR - / - and TfR + / - ES cell clones were microinjected into blastocysts to produce chimeric mice as described above . At 18 - 26 days of age , a distal portion of the tail was removed under anesthesia for preparation of DNA . DNA was purified from tails by incubation in PK lysis buffer ( 100mM Tris pH8 . 5 , 5mM EDTA , 0 . 2 % SDS , 200 mM NaCl , 200 µ g / ml proteinase K ) followed by phenol / chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation . Southern analysis was performed on 10 µ g of tail DNA , as described above , to identify chimeras . In addition , 100 µ L of blood for lymphocyte analysis was obtained by retro - orbital bleeding into heparinized capillary tubes and transferred to 5ml polystyrene tubes . Red cells were lysed with 1 ml red blood cell lysis buffer ( 8 . 3g / liter of ammonium chloride in 10mM Tris - Cl pH 7 . 5 ) at 37 o C for 2 to 3 minutes . Ice cold phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) supplemented with 2 % FCS was added and the remaining cells were pelleted at 4 o C . Cell pellets were resuspended in a small amount of the remaining liquid and 100 µ l of antibody ( Ab ) solution containing 1 : 100 dilutions of FITC - Ly9 . 1 , PE - Thy1 . 2 , and cychrome - B220 ( CD45R ) antibody ( Pharmingen ) was added . Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min , then washed in 2 % FCS / PBS and centrifuged as before . The pellets were resuspended in a small amount of the remaining liquid and 10 , 000 to 50 , 000 cells were counted for flow cytometry . Lymphocytes were identified by forward and side light scatter characteristics . For personal use only . on December 3 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From Ned et al . , page 8 Chimeras and control mice ( non - chimeric littermates , wild type 129 mice and RAG2 - / - mice ) were sacrificed in the eighth week of life . The bone marrow ( BM ) cavity of the femur was flushed with PBS to obtain cells for DNA preparation . Spleen , thymus , and lymph nodes ( inguinal , brachial , axial , and mesenteric ) were dissected into 3 ml ice cold 2 % FCS / PBS . Bone marrow , heart , and kidney , as well as a portion of the dissected spleen and thymus , were harvested for DNA . The dissected spleen , thymus , and lymph nodes were placed between pieces of mesh and the tissue was gently scraped apart . Further disruption was achieved by gently pipetting the cell suspension through a glass pipet . Red blood cells were lysed as described above . The resulting single cell suspensions were kept on ice and centrifuged at low speed for 6 to 7 minutes at 4 o C . The pellets were resuspended in a small amount of residual supernatant liquid . 100 µ l of resuspended cells plus 100 µ l of Ab solution were incubated on ice for 10 min . The cells were washed with 2 % FCS / PBS and recentrifuged , and the pellet was resuspended in a small amount of residual supernatant liquid for flow cytometry . 200 , 000 to 500 , 000 cells were analyzed for each sample from the chimeras . For the thymus , the Ab solution consisted of 1 : 100 dilutions of FITC - (cid:4) mouse Ly9 . 1 , PE - (cid:4) mouse CD4 , and cychrome - (cid:4) mouse CD8a ( Ly - 2 ) . For the spleen and lymph nodes , the Ab solution consisted of 1 : 100 dilutions of FITC - anti - mouse Ly9 . 1 , PE - anti - mouse Thy1 . 2 ( CD90 . 2 ) , and cychrome - anti - mouse B220 / CD45R . All antibodies were obtained from Pharmingen . All flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCalibur machine ( Becton Dickson ) using CellQuest software ( BD Biosciences ) and analyzed with FlowJo software ( Tree Star , Inc . ) . DNA was prepared with the Puregene DNA Isolation Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions ( Gentra Systems , Inc . ) .

Both TfR + / - and TfR - / - chimeras were identified by Southern blot analysis of tail DNA as described above . When the animals were 5 - 6 weeks old , lymphocytes were isolated and prepared as above from blood , spleen , and lymph nodes . Bone marrow , kidney , heart , and sections of the dissected spleen and thymus were also harvested for DNA . Peripheral blood lymphocytes were also stained with FITC - anti - mouse Ly9 . 1 , PE - anti - mouse IgM , APC - anti - mouse CD3 (cid:5) , and then fixed in 0 . 5 % formaldehyde / PBS for later analysis . Thymocytes , splenocytes and lymph node cells were analyzed as above . In addition , additional aliquots of spleen and lymph node cells were also stained with FITC - anti - mouse Ly9 . 1 , PE - anti - mouse IgM , and APC - anti - mouse CD3 (cid:5) . At least 10 , 000 cells were counted from blood , and at least 100 , 000 cells were counted from thymus , spleen , and lymph nodes when there was enough material present . All antibodies were obtained from Pharmingen . All flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCalibur machine ( Becton Dickson ) using CellQuest software ( BD Biosciences ) and analyzed with FlowJo software ( Tree Star , Inc . ) . RESULTS Generation of TfR - / - ES cells and analysis of C57BL / 6J chimeras We chose a chimera approach for this study , reasoning that adult tissues that were not populated with TfR - null cells must require transferrin receptor for their development . Two independent , homozygous TfR - / - ES clones ( E12 and H5 ) were isolated using a neomycin " step - up " selection strategy on heterozygous parental TfR + / - ES cells ( Fig . 1A ) . These TfR - / - ES clones were used in For personal use only . on December 3 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From Ned et al . , page 10 Figure 1 .

M indicates marker lanes . C . Hemoglobin electrophoresis of peripheral blood samples from TfR + / - chimeras ( het # 1 to 3 ) , a 129 wild type control , and 6 ( of 8 ) H5 TfR - / - chimeras . H5 chimeras # 1 and # 3 are not shown here , but in all cases , TfR - / - chimeras show contribution only from the host C57BL / 6J hemoglobin to circulating erythrocytes , indicating that the 129 - derived TfR - / - cells are unable to produce mature erythrocytes . all subsequent experiments . TfR - / - or parental TfR + / - ES cells were injected into wild type C57BL / 6J mouse blastocysts to produce chimeric animals . Chimeras were identified by patches of brown coat color , indicating contribution from cells of ES ( strain 129S4 / SvJae ) origin . Typically , mice showing chimerism in coat color also showed chimerism in other tissues . For personal use only . on December 3 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From Ned et al . , page 11 Eleven adult chimeric mice were analyzed from animals produced using TfR - / - ES cells , and 3 adult chimeric mice were analyzed from animals produced using TfR + / - cells . The degree of chimerism based on coat color was 10 - 85 % in the TfR - / - chimeras , with 4 animals ~ 30 % chimeric , and 5 animals having chimerism (cid:6) 50 % . Chimeric animals were similar to wild type littermates in their hematocrits , hemoglobin concentrations and red blood cell parameters ( data not shown ) . To determine whether the TfR - / - and TfR + / - cells could contribute to definitive adult erythropoiesis , we took advantage of the fact that C57BL / 6 and 129 hemoglobins have different electrophoretic properties . C57BL / 6 hemoglobin migrates as a single band ( s type ) and 129 hemoglobin migrates diffusely , producing multiple bands ( d type ) . Hemoglobin electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing experiments were performed on peripheral blood from TfR + / - and TfR - / - chimeras . Although one TfR + / - chimera ( with 25 % coat color chimerism ) did not show a contribution of TfR + / - ES cells to circulating erythrocytes , the other two TfR + / - chimeras ( 50 - 70 % chimerism by coat color ) did have 129 hemoglobin , indicating that the parental TfR + / - ES cells were able to contribute substantially to circulating erythrocytes ( Fig . 1C ) . In contrast , all chimeric animals generated from injection of TfR - / - ES cells showed no 129 hemoglobin , indicating that there was no contribution of TfR - / - cells to circulating erythrocytes ( Fig . 1B , 1C ) . We conclude from this experiment that TfR is also essential for adult erythropoiesis . The likely role of TfR in erythropoiesis is obvious – erythroid precursors must incorporate large amounts of iron to produce hemoglobin ; and , as observed previously in mouse embryos , 2 this requires TfR . Immature erythroid precursors that fail to hemoglobinize properly are probably For personal use only . on December 3 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From Ned et al . , page 12 destroyed in the bone marrow . However , other cell types need far less iron and may be able to rely on alternative iron uptake pathways . We investigated this by using Southern blot analysis to determine the contribution of TfR - / - and control TfR + / - ES cells to other tissues ( Fig . 2 ) . The presence of the smaller ( ~ 9kb ) band indicates contribution from ES cells carrying the null TfR allele . Figure 2 . TfR - / - cells do not contribute to hematopoietic tissues on a wild type C57BL / 6J background . A . Representative Southern blots of tissues from two E12 chimeras show contribution of TfR - / - cells ( targeted allele ) to all tissues except spleen , thymus , and bone marrow . I = intestine , Br = brain , Sk = skin , H = heart , K = kidney , Lv = liver , L = lung , P = pancreas , SC = spinal cord , Sp = spleen , Te = testis , Th = thymus , M = skeletal muscle , BM = bone marrow . m = marker lane . B . TfR + / - and TfR - / - cell contribution to spleen ( S ) , thymus ( T ) , and bone marrow ( BM ) in chimeras was re - examined to confirm the absence of TfR - / - cells in these tissues . Figure 2 shows representative results of Southern blot analyses for chimerism in multiple tissues . In these and other experiments , we found that both TfR + / - and TfR - / - ES cells could contribute substantially to brain , spinal cord , pancreas , intestine , heart , kidney , skeletal muscle , liver , lung and testis , indicating that TfR is not essential for the normal development of cells in those tissues and organs . However , because these structures are made up of multiple types of cells , we cannot For personal use only . on December 3 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From Ned et al . , page 13 exclude the possibility that some individual cell types do require TfR . Although we had seen increased apoptosis of neuroepithelial precursor cells in mid - gestation TfR - / - mouse embryos , we have not yet been able to determine whether TfR is necessary for development of specific structures in the central or peripheral nervous system of adult animals . However , no gross abnormalities in brain architecture were noted on necropsy of the TfR - / - chimeras ( data not shown ) . Results from our analysis of hematopoietic tissues were different from those of non - hematopoietic tissues . As expected , we found that control TfR + / - cells could also contribute substantially to bone marrow , spleen and thymus ( Fig . 2B ) . However , with the exception of one highly chimeric animal ( estimated 85 % from coat color ) , none of the chimeras produced from TfR - / - ES cells showed any detectable contribution of TfR - / - cells to those hematopoietic tissues ( Fig . 2 ) . The ~ 85 % chimera did show a very small contribution of TfR - / - cells to spleen and thymus , but not bone marrow ( data not shown ) . This suggests that the spleen and thymus chimerism seen in this animal may be due to stromal and / or epithelial cells . The fact that TfR - / - cells were not detected in the bone marrow in any C57BL / 6J chimeras suggested that most , if not all , hematopoietic cells ( or a hematopoietic stem cell ) were dependent upon TfR for their proliferation and / or differentiation . This conclusion is further supported by the fact that thymus and spleen , both populated primarily by hematopoietic cells , also showed little or no contribution of TfR - / - cells . In the remainder of our analysis we focused on the role of TfR in lymphopoiesis . For personal use only . on December 3 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From Ned et al . , page 14 TfR - / - lymphocyte development on a RAG2 - / - background is differentially affected We further tested the ability of TfR - / - cells to give rise to lymphocytes in vivo by generating TfR + / - and TfR - / - ES cell chimeras on a recombinase - activating gene - 2 deficient ( RAG2 - / - ) background . The RAG2 - / - complementation assay was developed to address the problem that homozygous disruption of some genes results in early embryonic lethality , precluding study of their roles in lymphopoiesis . 10 RAG2 - / - mice cannot produce mature lymphocytes because they cannot undergo somatic recombination of T cell receptor and immunoglobulin chain loci . In these mice , T cell development is interrupted at the CD4 - 8 - 3 - 44 - 25 + ( early pre - T ) stage , and B cell development is arrested at the B220 + CD43 + early pro - B cell stage . 9 Therefore , all mature lymphocytes in RAG2 - / - chimeric animals must be derived from the injected ES cells . 10 Consequently , this system allows for a more sensitive analysis of lymphocyte development from modified ES cells than can be achieved on a wild type genetic background . Chimeras were identified by Southern blot analysis of tail DNA taken at 18 to 26 days of age . Chimerism assessed in this way ranged from ~ 10 - 50 % ( data not shown ) . Flow cytometry was performed on blood samples taken at the same time , to detect T and B lymphocytes in the circulation . Anti - Ly9 . 1 antibody recognizes an allele of a surface glycoprotein antigen present on strain 129 lymphocytes but absent from our RAG2 - / - cells , which display the C57BL / 6 strain Ly9 . 2 specificity 11 - 13 . This difference permits the identification of lymphocytes derived from the injected ES cells . Two chimeras produced by blastocyst injection of parental TfR + / - ES cells showed full reconstitution of the mature , circulating lymphocyte pool , rescuing the defect in lymphocyte development seen in RAG2 - / - mice ( Fig . 3 ) . In contrast , although 10 , 000 to 50 , 000 For personal use only . on December 3 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From Ned et al . , page 15 nucleated blood cells were analyzed , very few , if any , Ly9 . 1 + Thy1 . 2 + or Ly9 . 1 + B220 + cells were present in the circulation of chimeras generated from injection of TfR - / - ES cells . This indicated that TfR - / - cells , in contrast to parental TfR + / - cells , were severely limited in their ability to develop into mature T or B lymphocytes . Figure 3 . TfR - / - chimeras fail to produce mature B or T cells in the circulation . Flow cytometry was performed on blood from TfR chimeras generated on a RAG2 - / - background . Nucleated blood cells were stained with Ly9 . 1 ( an antibody recognizing cells of 129 strain origin ) , B220 ( pan B - cell marker ) , and Thy1 . 2 ( pan T - cell marker ) . 10 , 000 to 50 , 000 cells were counted for each sample . The plots shown for TfR - / - chimera are representative of all 6 chimeras obtained . Percentages of cells in each quadrant are indicated . Fewer total cells were counted for the 129 control , therefore fewer cells appear on the dot plot . TfR - / - chimeras were sacrificed in the eighth week of life to analyze the lymphocyte content of the spleen , thymus , and lymph nodes by flow cytometry . For each sample , 200 , 000 - 500 , 000 cells were examined , in order to increase the sensitivity of the analysis and to allow detection of very small populations of cells . Spleen and lymph node cells were stained with Ly9 . 1 , Thy1 . 2 , and B220 antibodies . Thymus cells were stained with Ly9 . 1 , CD4 and CD8 antibodies . For personal use only . on December 3 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From Ned et al . , page 16 Thymus - derived cell populations from all of the TfR - / - chimeras were indistinguishable from the cell populations seen in RAG2 - / - control mice , indicating that TfR - / - cells cannot develop beyond the triple negative ( CD4 - 8 - 3 - ) developmental stage , in which RAG2 - / - cells are also arrested ( Fig . 4 ) . The few dots appearing in the CD4 + and CD8 + quadrants probably result from non - specific background staining , as RAG2 - / - mice have no CD4 + or CD8 + cells in the thymus . 9 Figure 4 . TfR - / - chimeras , like RAG2 - / - animals , fail to produce thymic cells that express CD4 or CD8 . Flow cytometry was performed on thymocytes from controls and 7 week old TfR - / - chimeras generated on a RAG2 - / - background . Thymus cells were stained with Ly9 . 1 , CD4 , and CD8 antibodies . 200 , 000 to 500 , 000 cells were counted in these analyses . The plot shown for TfR - / - chimera is representative of the 6 chimeras obtained . Percentages of cells in each quadrant are indicated . Furthermore , similar to RAG2 - / - controls , few , if any , Ly9 . 1 + Thy1 . 2 + cells were observed in samples from the spleen and lymph nodes of TfR - / - RAG2 - / - chimeras , indicating that there were no TfR - / - T lymphoid cells present in those sites ( Fig . 5 ) . In contrast , Southern blot analysis showed substantial ( 30 - 60 % ) TfR - / - ES cell contribution to other , non - hematopoietic organs as we had previously seen in the C57BL / 6J chimeras ( data not shown ) .

Nucleated cells from 7 - week - old chimeras and control animals were stained with Ly9 . 1 , B220 , and Thy1 . 2 and analyzed by flow cytometry . 200 , 000 to 500 , 000 cells were counted for these analyses . Percentages of cells in each quadrant are indicated . A . Splenic cells . B . Lymph node ( axial , brachial , inguinal , and mesenteric ) cells . All TfR - / - chimeras show few , if any , Ly9 . 1 + Thy1 . 2 + cells . Only those TfR - / - chimeras with TfR - / - cells in the bone marrow ( # 30 and # 32 ) display a small number of Ly9 . 1 + B220 + cells . The TfR - / - bone marrow negative chimera shown is representative of the other four TfR - / - bone marrow negative chimeras obtained . In our analysis of B lymphopoiesis , however , we did see a very small , but significant , contribution from TfR - / - cells to the B cell compartment in RAG2 - / - chimeras . Four of 6 chimeric animals examined had no detectable TfR - / - cells in the bone marrow ( by Southern blot analysis ; data not shown ) and no Ly9 . 1 + B220 + cells in the spleen or lymph nodes ( by flow cytometry ; Fig . 5 ) , indicating an absence of TfR - / - B cells early in development and in the periphery . For personal use only . on December 3 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From Ned et al . , page 18 However , two animals - - chimeras 30 and 32 - - did have TfR - / - cells in the bone marrow by Southern blot analysis ( ~ 20 % and ~ 30 % , respectively ; data not shown ) . These animals also had a very small Ly9 . 1 + B220 + population in the spleen and lymph nodes ( by flow cytometry , Fig . 5 ) . Due to the paucity of RAG2 - / - B220 + cells in these tissues , TfR - / - B cells account for up to 22 % and 41 % of the lymphocyte - gated cells in the spleen and lymph nodes , respectively , in chimera # 32 . The absolute numbers of Ly9 . 1 + B220 + cells in the spleens of TfR - / - chimeras were 1 , 740 out of 306 , 600 total cells counted for chimera # 30 , 3 , 143 cells out of 283 , 500 total cells counted for chimera # 32 , and 24 , 648 out of 190 , 950 total cells counted for the 129 control mouse . In the lymph nodes , chimera # 30 had 594 Ly9 . 1 + B220 + cells out of 268 , 200 total cells counted , chimera # 32 had 2 , 770 out of 312 , 000 total cells counted , and the 129 control mouse had 16 , 883 out of 211 , 050 total cells counted . PCR analysis of total spleen DNA from TfR - / - chimeras # 30 and # 32 showed a low level of D - J H immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangement in these animals ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the B220 + cell population included B lymphoid cells that had matured at least as far as the early pre - B stage . In a second group of chimeras , we further examined the ability of TfR - / - cells to produce mature lymphocytes . In accord with previous experiments , no TfR - / - RAG - / - chimeras had Ly9 . 1 + CD4 + or Ly9 . 1 + CD8 + cells in the thymus ( data not shown ) . They also had no detectable Ly9 . 1 + CD3 (cid:5) + cells above background in the spleen or blood ( data not shown ) . Figure 6 shows flow cytometry on spleen samples taken from a control TfR + / - chimera , a non - chimeric littermate , and the TfR - / - chimeras with presence of TfR - / - cells in the bone marrow . TfR - / - chimera H5 - 12 had TfR - / - cells in both the bone marrow ( ~ 40 % chimerism ) and spleen ( ~ 50 % chimerism ) by Southern blot analysis ( data not shown ) . This chimera had approximately half the percentage of IgM + cells in For personal use only . on December 3 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From Ned et al . , page 19 Figure 6 . Some TfR - / - chimeras are able to produce IgM + B cells Splenocytes from control and TfR - / - RAG2 - / - chimeras are stained with Ly9 . 1 and IgM . Two of the bone marrow - positive TfR - / - RAG2 - / - chimeras show IgM + cells , one with a substantial amount , indicating some ability to produce B cells that have completed V ( D ) J recombination . the spleen as the TfR + / - control chimera , and ~ 30 % as many total IgM + cells ( 8 , 731 out of 101 , 490 total cells counted versus 30 , 001 out of 106 , 545 total cells counted for the TfR + / - chimera control ) . A second TfR - / - chimera , H5 - 16 , showed fewer IgM + cells in the spleen ( 1 , 062 out of 101 , 685 total cells counted ) . These two chimeras , which displayed Ly9 . 1 + IgM + cells in the spleen , also showed Ly9 . 1 + IgM + cells in the lymph nodes , while only chimera H5 - 12 had Ly9 . 1 + IgM + cells in the peripheral blood ( data not shown ) . The presence of IgM + cells correlates For personal use only . on December 3 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From Ned et al . , page 20 with the extent of bone marrow chimerism – the most chimeric animal ( H5 - 12 ) had the greatest number and percentage of IgM + cells in the spleen , lymph nodes , and blood . A less chimeric animal ( H5 - 16 ) displayed fewer IgM + cells . Other TfR - / - chimeras , with no or very little TfR - / - contribution to the BM and spleen , had few if any IgM + cells in the spleen , lymph nodes , or blood . These results indicate overall that the absence of TfR impedes T cell differentiation beyond the earliest stage , while B lymphopoiesis is not as severely affected . DISCUSSION We extended our previous analysis 2 to ask whether TfR is necessary for adult erythropoiesis and for the development of other adult tissues . Adult TfR - / - chimeras produced on a wild type C57BL / 6J background showed contribution of TfR - / - cells to all tissues tested except those of hematopoietic origin - - bone marrow , spleen , and thymus . We conclude that most cell types are capable of assimilating iron through a mechanism that is not mediated by TfR . At least four TfR - independent iron acquisition pathways have been characterized in mammalian systems . TfR - independent uptake of Tf - bound iron has been noted in TfR - deficient CHO cells . 14 , 15 Low level , receptor - mediated uptake of ferritin has been shown in human erythroid precursors . 16 - 18 Non - Tf - bound iron has been shown to be taken up directly by a variety of cell types in vitro , 19 - 23 in accord with the observation that apotransferrinemic patients and Tf hpx / hpx mice develop systemic iron overload in non - hematopoietic tissues . 4 , 5 , 24 , 25 Most recently , iron delivery and uptake mediated by 24p3 / NGAL ( neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin ) has For personal use only . on December 3 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From Ned et al . , page 21 been described . 59 Fe - labeled 24p3 / NGAL was shown to deliver 59 Fe to developing kidney epithelial cells , with a pattern of receptor binding , trafficking , and topological distribution that was distinct from that of Tf . 26 The tissue distribution and developmental timing of 24p3 / NGAL - mediated iron transport appear to be different from , but complementary to , those of Tf . 26 24p3 / NGAL - mediated iron delivery and / or the other TfR - independent pathways must function efficiently when the Tf cycle is not available for iron delivery . It is possible that these alternative routes are preferred in many tissues , and that the Tf cycle plays little , if any , normal role in iron uptake by most mammalian cells . However , it will be difficult to investigate that possibility further until the molecular mechanisms underlying these alternative uptake pathways have been fully elucidated . The absence of TfR - / - cells in bone marrow and spleen of C57BL / 6J chimeras , and the absence of strain 129 hemoglobin , revealed that TfR is required for adult erythropoiesis . The absence of TfR - / - cells in the spleen and thymus likewise showed , surprisingly , that lymphocyte development is also severely compromised in the absence of TfR . There is a large literature on the roles of Tf and TfR in lymphocytes . Tf has long been known to be an essential factor for in vitro culture of lymphoid cells . 27 , 28 Little , if any , TfR is detectable on the surface of resting , mature T and B lymphocytes , but it is markedly induced upon antigen and mitogen stimulation , presumably to support the iron needs of rapidly proliferating cells . 29 - 32 , 33 - 36 Accordingly , anti - TfR antibodies have been shown to inhibit proliferation of stimulated For personal use only . on December 3 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From Ned et al . , page 22 peripheral lymphocytes . 32 , 37 , 38 In mature T cells , TfR expression is induced in response to autocrine activity of interleukin - 2 , and modulated by cellular iron content . 31 , 39 - 41 To further investigate the ability of TfR - / - cells to undergo normal lymphocyte differentiation , we took advantage of the sensitive RAG2 - / - complementation assay . Under normal conditions , T cell development proceeds through well - delineated stages , from thymic lymphoid progenitors to CD4 - 8 - 3 - “triple negative” substages distinguished by differing CD44 and CD25 expression , to CD4 + CD8 + double positive cells and then to mature CD4 - 8 + or CD4 + CD8 - single positive T cells ( reviewed in ref . 42 ) . TfR has been shown to be expressed only by proliferating thymocytes , including some subsets of CD4 - 8 - 3 - ( triple negative ) cells , and CD4 + 8 + 3 - ( double positive ) cells prior to expression of the T cell receptor . 43 In our TfR - / - RAG2 - / - chimera analysis , we never detected TfR - / - T lymphoid cells beyond the triple negative stage , indicating a very early block in differentiation . This is consistent with experiments carried out with fetal thymus organ cultures , which have shown that anti - TfR antibodies arrest the development of (cid:4)(cid:2) T cells at the CD4 - 8 - 3 - 44 - 25 + ( early pre - T ) stage , with very few cells developing to the double positive CD4 + 8 + 3 - stage . 44 B cell development also proceeds through well - defined stages , characterized by differential expression of distinct cell surface markers including CD43 and the µ heavy chain . Immature B cells have completed V ( D ) J recombination and express IgM , while fully mature B cells express both surface IgM and IgD ( reviewed in ref . 45 , 46 ) . In contrast to T cell development , however , there is little available information about the expression of TfR or its importance during B cell development . For personal use only . on December 3 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From Ned et al . , page 23 While some of the B220 + cells seen in RAG2 - / - chimeras may be NK cells and other non - B cells , 9 , 47 detection of immunoglobulin heavy chain D - J rearrangements by PCR and identification of Ly9 . 1 + IgM + cells in the spleen and lymph nodes of two of the TfR - / - chimeras indicate that a considerable fraction of TfR - / - B220 + cells can pass the stage at which RAG2 - / - lymphopoiesis is blocked . We interpret our observation that these cells were present in a substantial numbers in only one TfR - / - RAG - / - chimera , but absent in most other bone marrow positive TfR - / - RAG - / - chimeras , as an indication that absence of TfR impairs proliferation of early B lymphoid precursors as well , but does not prevent their differentiation . The presence , but decreased number , of these B cells suggests that TfR is important during the stages in which B cells normally receive signals to proliferate ( for example , after successful pairing of the VDJ - recombined Ig heavy chain with the surrogate light chain ) . It is likely that B lymphoid precursors use TfR for iron acquisition to support proliferation . It has been estimated that maturation from the early pro - B stage ( the point at which RAG2 - / - mice are blocked ) to the large pre - B stage ( where VDJ H recombination is complete and cells begin to express the pre - B cell receptor ) requires approximately 6 cell divisions . 48 - 50 Perhaps B cells cannot effectively sequester storage iron , 51 or cannot otherwise obtain the iron necessary for these divisions in the absence of TfR . While we have observed that both T and B lymphoid development are impaired when cells are actively proliferating and might be expected to have increased iron needs , we cannot rule out the possibility that TfR plays some other role in lymphoid development . It is possible , for example , that TfR mediates an important signal transduction event . Such a role has previously been For personal use only . on December 3 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From Ned et al . , page 24 proposed for TfR in the activation of mature T cells , 52 where it was shown that TfR interacts with the (cid:7) chain of the T Cell Receptor - CD3 complex and with ZAP70 , a T cell - specific protein tyrosine kinase . Stimulation with anti - CD3 (cid:5) and with anti - TfR antibodies induces phosphorylation of both TfR and CD3 (cid:7) , presumably initiating a signaling cascade of unknown function . We cannot exclude the possibility that lymphocyte proliferation is required for proper differentiation , but there are examples of differentiation in the presence of moderately - to severely - affected proliferation . 53 - 56 In summary , we have demonstrated that the transferrin receptor is not required for the development of most tissues and organs . However , TfR is required for adult erythropoiesis and has disparate roles in T and B lymphocyte development . B cell maturation can proceed normally , although there appears to be a proliferation defect in the absence of TfR . In contrast , T lymphopoiesis is completely arrested at a very early stage of maturation . We speculate that TfR may play another role in T cell development , in addition to iron delivery .
