To propel itself in infected cells , the pathogen Shigella ﬂexneri subverts the Cdc42 - controlled ma - chinery responsible for actin assembly during ﬁlopodia formation . Using a combination of bacterial motility as - says in platelet extracts with Escherichia coli express - ing the Shigella IcsA protein and in vitro analysis of re - constituted systems from puriﬁed proteins , we show here that the bacterial protein IcsA binds N - WASP and activates it in a Cdc42 - like fashion . Dramatic stimula - tion of actin assembly is linked to the formation of a ternary IcsA – N - WASP – Arp2 / 3 complex , which nucle - ates actin polymerization . The Arp2 / 3 complex is essential in initiation of actin assembly and Shigella movement , as previously observed for Listeria monocy - togenes . Activation of N - WASP by IcsA unmasks two domains acting together in insertional actin polymer - ization . The isolated COOH - terminal domain of N - WASP containing a verprolin - homology region , a coﬁlin - homology sequence , and an acidic terminal seg - ment ( VCA ) interacts with G - actin in a unique proﬁlin - like functional fashion . Hence , when N - WASP is acti - vated , its COOH - terminal domain feeds barbed end growth of ﬁlaments and lowers the critical concentra - tion at the bacterial surface . On the other hand , the NH 2 - terminal domain of N - WASP interacts with F - actin , mediating the attachment of the actin tail to the bacterium surface . VASP is not involved in Shigella movement , and the function of proﬁlin does not require its binding to proline - rich regions . Key words : Shigella ﬂexneri • IcsA • N - WASP • Arp2 / 3 complex • actin T HE motile response of living cells to extracellular stimuli is mediated by a highly integrated signaling cascade that transduces external signals to the actin cytoskeleton to elicit spatially controlled actin polymeriza - tion . Many of the components playing a role in this cas - cade have been identified . Among them , Rho , Rac , and Cdc42 , small GTPases of the Rho family , act as molecular regulators of actin assembly and control the formation of focal adhesions , lamellipodia , and filopodia , respectively ( Kozma et al . , 1995 ; Nobes and Hall , 1995 ) . On the other hand , the molecular mechanisms connecting Rac and Cdc42 to actin filament assembly during cell locomotion are still unknown . Intracellular actin - based propulsion of pathogens pro - vides an invaluable tool for the mechanistic analysis of the small GTPase effectors involved in the regulation of actin assembly ( Beckerle , 1998 ) . Shigella flexneri , Listeria mono - cytogenes , or the vaccinia virus ( Higley and Way , 1997 ) in - duce polarized constitutive actin assembly at their surface into a reticulated meshwork ( Bernardini et al . , 1989 ; Pre - vost et al . , 1992 ; Goldberg et al . , 1993 ; Nhieu and San - sonetti , 1999 for a recent review ) , and use the resulting propulsive force to move at rates of 1 – 50 (cid:109) m / min and spread from cell to cell by membrane invagination and ly - sis . A single bacterial surface protein , ActA on Listeria ( Domann et al . , 1992 ; Kocks et al . , 1992 ) , or IcsA ( VirG ) on Shigella ( Bernardini et al . , 1989 ; Lett et al . , 1989 ) , is necessary and sufficient ( Goldberg and Theriot , 1995 ; Kocks et al . , 1995 ) to induce actin - based motility of the bacterium . The Listeria system has been extensively stud - ied . The multidomain ActA protein recruits two essential factors in motility . The NH 2 - terminal domain of ActA in - teracts with the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Welch et al . , 1997 ) and activates its actin nucleating activity ( Welch et al . , 1998 ) . The central proline - rich domain of ActA interacts with the C . Egile and T . P . Loisel contributed equally to this work . Address correspondence to M . - F .

Although the IcsA protein has no sequence similarity to ActA , the physical features of Shigella actin - based move - ment are identical to Listeria , suggesting that at least some of the key players involved in movement are the same in the two systems . Two proteins have been reported to interact with IcsA , vinculin ( Suzuki et al . , 1996 ) and N - WASP ( Suzuki et al . , 1998 ) . Vinculin was postulated to associate with VASP via its ActA - like proline - rich seg - ment , suggesting that VASP would play in Shigella move - ment the same role as in Listeria ( Laine et al . , 1997 ) . How - ever , Shigella moves well in cells that do not express vinculin ( Goldberg , 1997 ) . N - WASP is a member of the WASP family of proteins , which thus far includes Las17 / Bee1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Lechler and Li , 1997 ; Li , 1997 ) ; Scar1 / WAVE in Dictyostelium discoideum , Cae - norhabditis elegans , Drosophila melanogaster , mouse , and humans ( Bear et al . , 1998 ; Miki et al . , 1998a ) ; and WASP ( Derry et al . , 1994 ) and its close homologue N - WASP ( Miki et al . , 1996 ) in humans . Mutations in the WASP pro - tein result in the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome ( Ramesh et al . , 1999 ) . Among WASP - related proteins , only WASP and N - WASP contain a consensus CRIB motif for Cdc42 binding . N - WASP enhances Cdc42 - induced formation of filopodia ( Miki et al . , 1998b ) . It has been proposed that N - WASP is activated by the N - WASP – Cdc42 interaction . In vitro , Cdc42 drives actin polymerization in acellular ex - tracts ( Ma et al . , 1998a ; Zigmond et al . , 1998 ) . WASP and N - WASP therefore are thought to link Cdc42 to actin po - lymerization ( Bi and Zigmond , 1999 , for a recent review ) . Proteins of the WASP family also contain a proline - rich region thought to bind SH3 domains , as well as profilin ( Suetsugu et al . , 1998 ) , and a COOH - terminal domain containing a verprolin - homology region , a cofilin - homol - ogy sequence , and an acidic terminal segment ( VCA ) 1 . The actin filament severing and depolymerizing activities of the VCA region are thought to be involved in mi - crospike formation ( Miki et al . , 1998b ) and in actin - based motility of Shigella ( Suzuki et al . , 1998 ) . The recent discovery that the acidic extreme COOH - terminal region of Scar1 interacts with p21 - Arc , a compo - nent of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ) , and enhances its actin nucleating activity ( Machesky et al . , 1999 ) was a landmark in the field . The Arp2 / 3 complex then was reported to mediate actin polymerization in - duced by Cdc42 ( Ma et al . , 1998b ) . Recently , activation of Arp2 / 3 by N - WASP was found enhanced by Cdc42 ( Ro - hatgi et al . , 1999 ) . In yeast , the Arp2 / 3 complex is acti - vated by the COOH - terminal domain of Bee1p ( Winter et al . , 1999 ) . However , the molecular mechanism for site - directed actin assembly and production of force and move - ment remains unknown . The goal of our work was to understand how the differ - ent components of the actin assembly machinery are se - quentially switched on to elicit actin nucleation and inser - tional polymerization to produce Shigella movement . To address this issue , we have used a combination of bacterial motility assays using IcsA - expressing Escherichia coli in platelet and brain extracts , immunodepletion and add - back methods , and in vitro steady state and kinetic mea - surements of actin polymerization in the presence of indi - vidual and combined components of the machinery , using purified IcsA , N - WASP , VCA , Arp2 / 3 complex , Cdc42 , VASP , and wild - type and mutated profilins . We’ve come up with a working model for Shigella movement that pro - vides a general insight into the mechanism of actin - based cellular extensions . Materials and Methods Bacterial Strains E . coli BUG 968 strain and BUG 896 strain expressing the membrane form of IcsA ( BUG 968 harboring pHS3199 , a pUC8 plasmid containing IcsA gene ; Kocks et al . 1995 ) were grown at 37 (cid:56) C in 2YT in the presence of 100 (cid:109) g / ml ampicillin until midexponential phase was reached . Listeria strain Lut12 ( pActA3 ) overexpressing ActA ( Kocks et al . , 1992 ) was grown at 37 (cid:56) C in brain / heart infusion medium in the presence of 7 (cid:109) g / ml chloramphenicol and 5 (cid:109) g / ml erythromycin until midexponential phase was reached . Bacteria were kept frozen in 30 % glycerol at (cid:50) 80 (cid:56) C . Antibodies Polyclonal rabbit antibodies were raised against human N - WASP protein residues 473 - EVMQKRSKAIHSSDED - 488 ( C412 antibodies ) and against recombinant human N - WASP protein obtained from baculovirus ( NW011 antibodies ) . Anti - Arp3 polyclonal antibodies ( AR3 ) were raised in rab - bits against Arp3 residues YEEIGPSIVRHNPVFGVMS . Affinity - puri - fied C421 , NW011 , and AR3 antibodies were used for Western blot and immunofluorescence , respectively , at 10 (cid:109) g / ml concentration . Antibovine profilin polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits and used in Western blots at a 1 : 5 , 000 dilution . Platelet and Brain Extracts Human platelet extracts were prepared from outdated unstimulated prep - arations as previously described ( Laurent and Carlier , 1997 ) . Bovine brain extracts were prepared as follows . Brain was homogenized in 1 vol of 0 . 1 M MES , pH 6 . 8 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , and clarified by centrifugation at 10 , 000 g for 30 min at 4 (cid:56) C . Tubulin and neurofilaments were removed by centrifugation for 1 h at 150 , 000 g after one cycle of microtubule assembly at 37 (cid:56) C for 30 min in the presence 0 . 5 mM GTP , 4 M glycerol , and 0 . 25 mM MgCl 2 . The supernatant ( S 2 ) was stored at (cid:50) 80 (cid:56) C . Recombinant Proteins Expression and Purification Histidine - tagged human N - WASP was expressed in High Five insect cells . Human cDNA was cloned in pFast Bac Htb ( Life Technologies , Inc . ) and recombinant baculovirus constructed using standard protocol of transfec - tion – recombination in insect cell lines . High Five insect cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 2 . Cell culture was performed in suspen - sion , in High Five serum - free medium , under vigorous shaking at 27 (cid:56) C for 40 h . Protein purification was performed by DEAE cellulose at pH 7 . 8 and cobalt affinity chromatography , as described by Laurent et al . ( 1999 ) . Recombinant histidine - tagged human VASP was expressed and purified as described previously ( Laurent et al . , 1999 ) . The NH 2 - terminal ( Nt ) and COOH - terminal domains ( VCA ) of hu - man N - WASP were expressed and purified as GST fusion proteins in E . coli . Human cDNA regions encoding N - WASP Nt ( residues 1 - 276 ) and VCA ( residues 392 - 505 ) were amplified by PCR from human brain cDNA using oligonucleotides phNW1 ( 5 (cid:57) - ccggaattcATGAGCTCCGTCCAG - CAGCAG - 3 (cid:57) ) , phNW276 ( 5 (cid:57) - ccgctcgagTCACTTGCCTCCGCAGTTC - ATTTTTAAC - 3 (cid:57) ) , and oligonucleotides phNW392 ( 5 (cid:57) - ccggaattcCCT - TCTGATGGGGACCATCAG - 3 (cid:57) ) , phNW505 ( 5 (cid:57) - ccgctcgagTCAGTC - TTCCCACTCATCATC - 3 (cid:57) ) , respectively .

Shigella flexneri Actin - based Motility 1321 fragments were cloned in EcoRI and XhoI sites in pGEX4T - 1 plasmid , re - spectively , to generate pCENHN and pCECHN plasmids . GST - Nt and GST - VCA protein expressions were obtained using BL21 E . coli strain according to standard induction and purification procedures . GST - Nt and GST - VCA glutathione Sepharose beads were kept at 4 (cid:56) C until use . GST - Nt protein was eluted from beads and VCA protein was obtained by thrombin cleavage . Both proteins were dialyzed against 10 mM Tris - Cl (cid:50) , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM DTT , 50 mM KCl , and 0 . 01 % NaN 3 , frozen on liquid nitro - gen and stored at (cid:50) 80 (cid:56) C . The concentration of VCA was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient (cid:101) 0 . 1 % of 0 . 467 cm (cid:50) 1 at 278 nm calculated from the amino acid sequence , and a mol wt of 12 , 900 D . Due to the acidic character of VCA , the Bradford protein assay gave underestimated values of the concentration . Human Cdc42 was also expressed as a GST fusion protein in E . coli . Hu - man cDNA was cloned in pGEX2T expression plasmid and was a kind gift from Dr . Alan Hall ( Medical Research Council , University College , Lon - don , UK ) . Protein was expressed in E . coli JM109 , purified on glutathione Sepharose as described , and kept on beads at 4 (cid:56) C in 10 mM Tris - Cl (cid:50) , pH 7 . 6 , 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM DTT , and 0 . 1 mM GTP . When re - quired , GST - Cdc42 was loaded with GDP or GTP (cid:103) S on beads by a 1 - h in - cubation at room temperature on a wheel in 50 mM Tris - Cl (cid:50) , pH 7 . 6 , 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , 10 mM EDTA , and 0 . 1 mM GDP or GTP (cid:103) S . The exchange reaction was stopped by addition of 10 mM MgCl 2 . IcsA 53 - 508 protein was purified as a GST fusion protein as described in Suzuki et al . ( 1996 ) . Purification of Arp2 / 3 Complex from Bovine Brain Bovine Arp2 / 3 complex was purified from bovine brain extracts by a novel two step method as follows . 100 ml of S 2 was dialyzed against 50 mM MES , pH 6 . 8 , containing 1 mM DTT , 1 mM EDTA , and 1 mM MgCl 2 ( buffer A ) , and loaded on an SP - Trisacryl column ( 2 . 5 (cid:51) 12 cm ) equili - brated in buffer A . After a wash step with 30 mM KCl , the Arp2 / 3 com - plex was eluted with 80 mM KCl in buffer A . This fraction was equili - brated in 20 mM Tris - Cl (cid:50) , pH 7 . 5 , containing 25 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , and 0 . 1 mM ATP - Tris , pH 7 . 5 ( buffer B ) , and loaded on a GST - VCA glutathione Sepharose column ( 0 . 5 (cid:51) 1 cm ) in buffer B . Most of the proteins were washed off the column by buffer B , the remaining non - Arp2 / 3 proteins were eluted by 0 . 2 M KCl in buffer B , pending a small loss of Arp2 / 3 activity , and the pure Arp2 / 3 complex was eluted with 0 . 2 M MgCl 2 in buffer B ( see Fig . 2 b for the purity of the Arp2 / 3 complex ) . After dialysis against buffer B , the protein was concen - trated using a Centriprep 30 cartridge ( Amicon ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex was supplemented with 0 . 2 M sucrose and stored at (cid:50) 80 (cid:56) C . The activity of Arp2 / 3 along the purification steps was monitored spectrofluorimetrically , using the ability of Arp2 / 3 to activate the branched polymerization of ac - tin filaments in the presence of VCA . The assay ( 80 (cid:109) l ) contained 2 . 5 (cid:109) M Mg - G - actin ( 10 % pyrenyl - labeled ) , 0 . 5 (cid:109) M VCA , and 10 (cid:109) l of the tested fraction in 5 mM Tris - Cl (cid:50) , pH 7 . 8 buffer , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 1 M KCl , and 1 mM MgCl 2 . The time course of increase in pyrenyl - actin fluo - rescence was followed . The activity of Arp2 / 3 was detected by the steep sigmoidal increase in fluorescence , indicative of branched polymerization . The activity of Arp2 / 3 was easily observed , even in the S 2 fraction . Alter - natively , the activity of Arp2 / 3 was detected by the video - microscopy bac - terial motility assay , using the property of Arp2 / 3 to initiate the formation of actin clouds at the surface of Listeria incubated in 4 (cid:109) M rhodamine - labeled actin . The results of the two tests were in good agreement with each other , but the spectrofluorometric assay was more convenient and easily amenable to a quantitative estimate of the amount of Arp2 / 3 in the tested fractions by comparison with a calibration series of time courses performed with known concentrations of pure Arp2 / 3 . The concentration of Arp2 / 3 complex was determined spectrophotometrically using an ex - tinction coefficient of 224 , 480 M (cid:50) 1 (cid:63) cm (cid:50) 1 at 278 nm , derived from the amino acid sequence of the seven polypeptides composing the 223 , 949 - D complex . A good agreement was obtained between the spectrophotomet - ric measurement and the bicinchoninic acid assay , with BSA as a standard . Typically , 1 . 2 nmol ( 0 . 26 mg ) of pure Arp2 / 3 complex was obtained from 100 ml brain S 2 supernatant . Depletion of Arp2 / 3 Complex , VASP , and Profilin from Platelet Extracts Arp2 / 3 complex was depleted from platelet extracts using a variation of the coprecipitation method described by Machesky and Insall ( 1998 ) . Var - ious amounts of glutathione Sepharose - coupled GST - VCA beads ( 20 , 40 , and 80 (cid:109) g ) were incubated with 25 (cid:109) l of platelet extracts for 30 min at 4 (cid:56) C on a rotating wheel . Beads were pelleted at 5 , 000 g for 15 s . Depletion of the Arp2 / 3 complex was monitored by Western blotting of aliquots of pro - tein extracts and beads . Add - back was done using the Arp2 / 3 complex pu - rified from bovine brain . VASP immunodepletion was carried out as described previously ( Lau - rent et al . , 1999 ) . Add - back was done using the recombinant VASP puri - fied from insect cells . Profilin depletion was carried out by two consecutive poly - L - proline chromatography steps , as described by Laurent et al . ( 1999 ) . Profilin de - pletion was monitored by Western blotting . Add - back was done using the purified wild - type profilin or the H133S mutant profilin , described as un - able to bind poly - L - proline ( Bjorkegren - Sjogren et al . , 1997 ) . Actin and Regulatory Proteins Actin was purified from rabbit muscle and isolated as Ca - ATP - G - actin by gel filtration on Sephadex G - 200 in G buffer ( 5 mM Tris - Cl (cid:50) , pH 7 . 8 , con - taining 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , and 1 mM DTT ) . Actin was pyrenyl - or rhodamine - labeled , and converted into Mg - G - actin before polymeriza - tion , as described by Carlier et al . ( 1997 ) . Mg - actin was polymerized by addition of 1 mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 1 M KCl ( physiological ionic conditions ) . When actin was polymerized in the presence of gelsolin , no EGTA was added to the solution , and Ca - ATP - G - actin supplemented with the de - sired amount of gelsolin was polymerized by addition of 2 mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 1 M KCl . Thymosin (cid:98) 4 was purified from bovine spleen as described by Panta - loni and Carlier ( 1993 ) . Gelsolin purified from human plasma was a kind gift from Dr . Yukio Doi ( University of Kyoto , Kyoto , Japan ) . Spectrin - actin seeds were isolated from human erythrocytes as de - scribed by Casella et al . ( 1986 ) . Actin Polymerization Assays Critical concentration plots were performed by serial dilution of pyrenyl - labeled F - actin solutions in F buffer ( 5 mM Tris - Cl (cid:50) , pH 7 . 8 , containing 1 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 0 . 1 M KCl ) and incubated overnight at room temperature . Polymerization assays were performed using the change in pyrenyl - actin fluorescence . Measurements were carried out in a Spex Fluorolog 2 instrument thermostated at 20 (cid:56) C , with excitation and emission wavelengths of 366 and 407 nm , respectively , and appropriate filters placed on the excitation and emisssion beams to eliminate stray light and bleaching , which interfere in polymerization in the presence of Arp2 / 3 ( Pantaloni , D . , manuscript in preparation ) . The G - actin sequestering activity was measured by the shift in critical concentration plots with gelsolin - capped filament barbed ends . The equi - librium dissociation constant , K d , for the actin - sequestering protein com - plex was derived from the measurements of the concentration , [ A 0 ] , of un - assembled actin at steady state ( abscissa intercept of the critical concentration plots ) and of the critical concentration , [ A C ] , determined in the absence of sequestering agent . The following equation was used : K d (cid:53) [ A C ] (cid:63) ( [ S 0 ] (cid:50) [ A 0 ] (cid:49) [ A C ] ) / ( [ A 0 ] (cid:50) [ A C ] ) , in which [ S 0 ] represents the to - tal concentration of sequestering protein . Rates of filament growth from barbed and pointed ends were measured using spectrin – actin seeds or gelsolin - capped filaments , added at time zero to a solution of 1 (cid:109) M MgATP – G - actin ( 10 % pyrenyl - labeled ) in polymer - ization buffer . The gelsolin - capped filament solution contained 5 (cid:109) M F - actin polymerized in the presence of 16 . 7 nM gelsolin for 2 h , and di - luted 20 - fold into the G - actin solution . Motility Assays Frozen bacteria were thawed and spun down at 4 , 000 g for 5 min at 22 (cid:56) C , resuspended at 6 (cid:51) 10 9 bacteria / ml in XB buffer ( 10 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 7 , 0 . 1 M KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , and 50 mM sucrose ) . Motility as - says were performed by mixing 4 (cid:109) l of thawed extracts supplemented with 12 (cid:109) l of a mixture containing 5 (cid:109) M F - actin , 0 . 38 % methyl cellulose , 6 mM DTT , 2 mM ATP / MgCl 2 , 1 . 5 (cid:51) 10 (cid:50) 3 % DABCO , 1 (cid:109) M rhodamine - actin , and 2 (cid:51) 10 8 bacteria / ml . An aliquot of 2 . 5 (cid:109) l was squashed between a 22 (cid:51) 22 mm coverslip and a slide , sealed with VALAP , and incubated for 5 min at room temperature before motility measurements . Fluorescence micros - copy observations and data acquisition were carried out as previously de - scribed ( Laurent et al . , 1999 ) . N - WASP - coated E . coli ( IcsA ) were pre - pared as follows : 20 (cid:109) l of a suspension of 6 (cid:51) 10 9 bacteria / ml were incubated with 5 (cid:109) l of 1 (cid:109) M N - WASP for 5 min at room temperature . on F eb r ua r y 23 , 2013 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published September 20 , 1999 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 146 , 1999 1322 Bacteria were pelleted , washed , and resuspended in 20 (cid:109) l of XB buffer and kept on ice . The N - WASP – IcsA complex remains stable for several hours on ice . Immunofluorescence Analysis of Shigella - infected HeLa Cells HeLa cells were infected as follows : overnight culture of Shigella M90T strain was diluted in tryptic soy broth , grown to midexponential phase , centrifuged at 5 , 000 g for 5 min , washed , and resuspended at 10 8 bacteria / ml ( M90T ) in MEM , 50 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 . HeLa cells , seeded on glass cov - erslips , were washed three times with MEM , overlaid with the bacterial suspension , and centrifuged for 10 min at 800 g . Bacterial entry was al - lowed by 30 min incubation at 37 (cid:56) C . Infected cells were washed with MEM five times and incubated with MEM , 50 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , with 50 (cid:109) g / ml of gentamicin for a further 1 h at 37 (cid:56) C , to allow intracellular spread . For immunofluorescence staining , infected cells were permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 in 0 . 1 M MES , pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 4 % PEG 6000 , and then fixed for 30 min in 3 . 7 % paraformalde - hyde in PBS . After quenching with NH 4 Cl 50 mM in PBS for 10 min and saturation for 30 min in PBS - BSA 2 % , infected cells were incubated with specific mono - or polyclonal antibodies . Affinity - purified antihu - man N - WASP polyclonal NW011 antibodies and polyclonal Arp3 anti - bodies were used at 10 (cid:109) g / ml concentration . Texas red - conjugated sec - ondary antibodies ( Nycomed Amersham Inc . ) were used . F - actin was visualized by FITC - phalloidin ( 0 . 1 mg / ml ; Sigma Chemical Co . ) . Prepara - tions were examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope ( Zeiss Axiophot ) . In Vitro Protein Binding Assays Glutathione Sepharose coupled to GST – IcsA or to GST was equilibrated in buffer P ( 20 mM Tris - Cl (cid:50) , pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 0 . 1 % BSA ) . 100 pmol of protein - bound beads and 80 pmol of purified N - WASP or VCA were mixed in 100 (cid:109) l ( total vol ) and incubated for 1 h at 4 (cid:56) C on a rotating wheel . Supernatants were collected . Beads were rinsed twice with buffer P . Free and bound N - WASP and VCA were detected by Western blotting after resolving the proteins by SDS - PAGE . Results Association of N - WASP to IcsA Is Required for Actin - based Motility of E . coli ( IcsA ) in Platelet Extracts Actin - based motility of E . coli ( IcsA ) has been observed in Xenopus egg extracts ( Goldberg and Theriot , 1995 ; Kocks et al . , 1995 , Suzuki et al . , 1998 ) . Motility was observed as well in HeLa cell extracts and murine or bovine brain ex - tracts , but not at all in human platelet extracts , which , in contrast , supports actin - based motility of Listeria . This puzzling observation suggested that an essential factor for Shigella motility is missing in platelets . The requirement of N - WASP for Shigella motility in Xenopus egg extracts has recently been demonstrated ( Suzuki et al . , 1998 ) . Im - munoblotting using polyclonal NW 011 antibodies that recognize both WASP and N - WASP ( Fig . 1 a ) , showed that N - WASP was present in brain extracts , but absent in platelets , which , in contrast , contain the lower molecular weight WASP homologous protein mainly expressed in hematopoietic cells ( Fig . 1 a ) , whose mutations result in the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome ( Ramesh et al . , 1999 ) . The endogenous WASP protein , homologue of N - WASP in platelets , apparently cannot bind IcsA . To check whether the absence of N - WASP was responsible for the lack of E . coli ( IcsA ) motility in platelet extracts , recombinant hu - man N - WASP was expressed using the baculovirus system and purified ( Fig . 1 b ) . The interaction of recombinant N - WASP with IcsA was verified by successful binding of N - WASP on glutathione Sepharose beads to which the GST – IcsA fusion protein was attached ( Fig . 1 c ) . The iso - lated VCA of N - WASP , in contrast , did not bind to IcsA ( Fig . 1 c ) . Actin - based motility of E . coli ( IcsA ) was re - stored by addition of N - WASP to platelet extracts . Specif - ically , upon addition of 10 nM N - WASP , actin clouds were observed . Comets were observed upon addition of 50 nM N - WASP , optimum movement was seen at 100 nM N - WASP , and inhibition occurred at 1 (cid:109) M N - WASP . Neither bacte - rial motility nor actin polymerization were observed under the same conditions with control BUG 968 E . coli bacteria that did not express IcsA ( see Materials and Methods ) . Consistent with the apparent high affinity of N - WASP for IcsA , when E . coli ( IcsA ) bacteria were incubated with N - WASP at concentrations as low as 0 . 1 (cid:109) M , washed , and added to platelet extracts , bacterial actin - based motility was readily observed ( Fig . 1 d ) . Bacteria induced actin po - lymerization and moved at rates similar to Listeria ( 4 (cid:109) m / min , SD (cid:53) 1 , n (cid:53) 20 ) . In contrast , when control BUG 968 E . coli bacteria that did not express IcsA were preincu - bated with N - WASP , washed , and added to platelet ex - tracts , they failed to induce actin assembly and to move . Consistent with these results , beads coated with GST – IcsA 53 - 508 induced actin assembly at their surface in plate - let extracts only when they were first preincubated with N - WASP ( Fig . 1 e ) . Control GST beads , preincubated in the same N - WASP solution , and washed , failed to induce actin assembly in platelet extracts . Neither actin assembly nor movement was observed when bacteria or GST – IcsA beads were preincubated with VCA instead of N - WASP . Accordingly , bacterial movement and actin assembly were not inhibited by the presence of a 20 - fold molar excess of VCA over N - WASP in the preincubation step . Hence , VCA does not displace IcsA - bound N - WASP . These results demonstrate that interaction of IcsA with N - WASP is crucial for IcsA - mediated actin polymeriza - tion and bacterial motility , and that VCA does not interact with IcsA . Association of Arp2 / 3 Complex with N - WASP Bound to IcsA at the Surface of E . coli ( IcsA ) Is Necessary and Sufficient for Initiation of Actin Assembly The N - WASP protein was proposed to initiate actin as - sembly at the surface of bacteria by interacting with actin via its two verprolin homology regions and / or its cofilin homology sequence ( Miki et al . , 1998b ; Suzuki et al . , 1998 ) . However , when either the E . coli ( IcsA ) bacteria or the GST – IcsA beads precoated with N - WASP were incu - bated in a solution of rhodamine - labeled F - actin , no initia - tion of actin assembly was observed at their surface ( data not shown ) , indicating that , in itself , the actin - binding property of N - WASP is not sufficient for inducing the ac - tin assembly seen in platelet extracts . Recently , the association of the Arp2 / 3 complex with Scar1 , a member of the WASP family , was demonstrated to enhance the actin nucleation activity of Arp2 / 3 complex in vitro ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ; Machesky et al . , 1999 ) . To investigate the role of Arp2 / 3 complex in Shi - gella motility , platelet extracts were at least 80 % depleted in Arp2 / 3 complex by GST - VCA beads ( Fig . 2 a ) .

Add - back of 0 . 15 (cid:109) M pure Arp2 / 3 from bovine brain to the depleted platelet ex - tracts restored bacterial movement at a rate of 1 (cid:54) 0 . 2 (cid:109) m / min , i . e . , 30 % of the speed observed in the mock - depleted extracts . The N - WASP – coated E . coli ( IcsA ) bacteria , N - WASP – bound GST – IcsA beads , or Listeria bacteria were then incubated in a solution of rhodamine - labeled F - actin con - taining pure Arp2 / 3 from bovine brain ( Fig . 2 b ) . Forma - tion of actin clouds around the bacteria and the beads was immediately observed ( Fig . 2 c ) . These results demon - strate that IcsA - bound N - WASP interacts with Arp2 / 3 complex , and that the IcsA – N - WASP – Arp2 / 3 complex is able to initiate local actin assembly in a solution of pure actin . Previously , we have shown , using phalloidin , that G - actin , not F - actin , was recruited by Arp2 / 3 at the Liste - ria surface ( Marchand et al . , 1995 ) . Even though actin was polymerized in the assay , it is the G - actin that coexists at steady state with the filaments that are shuttled onto barbed ends created by Arp2 / 3 . To get more insight into the respective roles of N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 in Shigella movement , immunolo - calization of the two proteins in infected cells was carried out . N - WASP colocalized with IcsA at the surface of Shi - gella , whereas the Arp2 / 3 complex was found in the entire ac - tin tail ( Fig . 3 ) . In conclusion , Arp2 / 3 interacts with N - WASP to initiate actin assembly at the surface of Shig ella , but the interaction of Arp2 / 3 with N - WASP is not permanent , and the Arp2 / 3 complex remains incorporated into the assem - bled filaments . In contrast , the interaction of N - WASP with IcsA is probably very strong and in slow equilibrium . Figure 1 .

The Arp2 / 3 complex purified from bovine brain was able to induce the branched polymerization of actin filaments ( Ressad et al . , 1999 ) , like the Acanthamoeba complex ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ) . The activity of the Arp2 / 3 com - plex appeared enhanced by either the VCA domain of N - WASP ( Fig . 4 a ) or by the entire N - WASP protein ( Fig . 4 b ) in the same concentration - dependent manner . At 2 . 5 (cid:109) M actin , the optimum activation was observed at 0 . 5 (cid:109) M VCA or N - WASP . The activation decreased at higher con - centrations of VCA or N - WASP ( Fig . 4 c ) . The maximum extent of activation was fourfold higher with VCA than with N - WASP . The effect of N - WASP , but not of VCA , was further stimulated ( about threefold ) by Cdc42 - GTP (cid:103) S , not by Cdc42 - GDP ( Fig . 4 d ) , in agreement with Rohatgi et al . ( 1999 ) . In conclusion , in the whole N - WASP protein , the VCA domain is accessible to Arp2 / 3 complex and capable of ac - tivating Arp2 / 3 function in actin assembly . IcsA Mimics Cdc42 - induced Activation of N - WASP The recombinant IcsA protein greatly stimulated the N - WASP – Arp2 / 3 - induced polymerization of actin in a concentration - dependent , saturable fashion ( Fig . 4 e ) . In the presence of 20 nM Arp2 / 3 complex and 130 nM N - WASP , 80 % of the maximal polymerization rate was reached upon addition of 30 nM IcsA , indicating that maximal ac - tivity is associated with the formation of a ternary Arp2 / 3 – Figure 2 . Arp2 / 3 complex is essential for actin nucleation at the surface of E . coli ( IcsA ) and Listeria . a , Arp2 / 3 complex depletion in platelet extracts .

Shigella flexneri Actin - based Motility 1325 N - WASP – IcsA complex in which the equilibrium K d of IcsA is in the nanomolar range . The activation reached with IcsA was greater than with Cdc42 . Interestingly , IcsA by itself did not affect the polymerization of actin alone , but at concentrations as low as 0 . 1 (cid:109) M , it activated the Arp2 / 3 complex to some extent in the absence of N - WASP ( control curves in Fig . 4 e ) , which indicates that IcsA inter - acts with Arp2 / 3 complex . In the presence of N - WASP , IcsA , and Arp2 / 3 , a true triangular complex is formed be - tween the three proteins at the surface of Shigella , enhanc - ing the stability of the edifice . The Isolated VCA of N - WASP Binds G - actin and Affects Actin Assembly in a Profilin - like Fashion The VCA of N - WASP was described as a filament depoly - merizing filament severing protein ( Miki et al . , 1996 , 1998b ; Suzuki et al . , 1998 ) . These conclusions do not ap - pear confirmed in the present work . The interaction of isolated VCA with actin was examined in steady state and kinetic experiments , on the dynamics of pointed and barbed ends separately . When filament barbed ends are capped by gelsolin , VCA induced a shift in the critical concentration plots ( Fig . 5 a ) . Addition of increasing amounts of VCA to F - actin at a given concentration caused a linear decrease in F - actin at steady state , leading to eventual complete de - polymerization at high concentration of VCA . The slope of the plot ( Fig . 5 b ) was independent of the actin concen - tration . Hence , VCA behaves like a G - actin sequestering protein when barbed ends are capped . A value of 0 . 8 (cid:54) 0 . 1 (cid:109) M was derived for the equilibrium K d of the VCA – G - actin complex , from analysis of the data in Fig . 5 , a and b . When barbed ends were free , the behavior of VCA was different . No efficient sequestration of actin was observed . In the presence of 5 (cid:109) M VCA , a modest shift of the critical concentration plots from 0 . 12 to 0 . 21 (cid:109) M unassembled ac - tin was observed , while a 3 . 5 - fold larger shift ( up to 0 . 7 (cid:109) M unassembled actin ) was expected , using the K d value of 0 . 8 (cid:109) M . These results are reminiscent of the effect of pro - filin in actin assembly ( Pantaloni and Carlier , 1993 ) and they demonstrate that when barbed ends are free , the con - centration of ATP – G - actin at steady state is lowered by VCA , suggesting that VCA – actin complex , like profilin – actin , participates in barbed end assembly . Specifically , in the experiment shown in Fig . 5 c , the amount of unassem - bled actin , [ A ] 0 , at steady state is 0 . 21 (cid:109) M , which distrib - utes into free G - actin , [ A ] , and VCA – actin complex , [ VA ] . The concentrations of free G - actin and VCA - actin are linked by the law of mass action : ( [ A ] (cid:63) ( [ V ] total (cid:50) [ VA ] ) / [ VA ] (cid:53) K d ) ; and by the sum : [ A ] 0 (cid:53) [ A ] (cid:49) [ VA ] ; resulting in a quadratic equation that has a single solution : [ A ] (cid:53) 0 . 03 (cid:109) M , [ VA ] (cid:53) 0 . 18 (cid:109) M . The concentration of free actin , thus , appears fourfold lower than 0 . 12 (cid:109) M , the value that is measured in the absence of VCA . Evidence for the participation of VCA – actin complex in barbed end assembly was directly provided by measure - ments of the rate of filament growth . The rate of elonga - tion from G - actin at pointed ends , initiated by gelsolin – actin complex , was totally inhibited by VCA ( Fig . 5 c ) , confirming that the VCA – actin complex does not poly - merize onto pointed ends . In contrast , growth of barbed ends initiated by spectrin – actin seeds , was inhibited only by 30 % at saturation by VCA , indicating that the VCA – actin complex associates to barbed ends with a rate con - stant 30 % lower than G - actin ( Fig . 5 d ) . Again , this re - sult is strikingly similar to the one obtained with profilin ( Gutsche - Perelroizen et al . , 1999 ) . Like profilin , VCA de - livers G - actin subunits to growing barbed ends and disso - ciates from the barbed end after incorporation of actin , in Figure 3 .

The coupling to ATP hydrolysis was demonstrated to be thermodynami - cally required to account for the decrease in partial critical concentration of actin ( Pantaloni and Carlier , 1993 ) . Spontaneous polymerization of actin was inhibited by VCA , exactly as observed with profilin ( data not shown ) . Hence , VCA – actin complex , like profilin – actin complex , is able to productively associate to barbed ends , but not to nucleate F - actin . This result accounts for the decrease ob - served in the activation of Arp2 / 3 complex at high VCA or Figure 4 .

The NH 2 - terminal Domain of N - WASP Binds and Stabilizes F - Actin in an IcsA - enhanced Fashion Full - length N - WASP did not display the G - actin seques - tering activity of VCA , when barbed ends were capped by gelsolin . No depolymerization of gelsolin - capped F - actin was measured at steady state , and only weak inhibition in the rate of growth at the pointed ends of gelsolin - capped filaments was detected by addition of N - WASP . Instead , N - WASP bound to F - actin and stabilized the filaments , as shown by the observed decrease in critical concentration ( Fig . 6 a ) . A slight decrease in the slope of the pyrenyl flu - orescence critical concentration plots indicated that the fluorescence of F - actin was partially quenched upon bind - ing N - WASP . The binding to F - actin and the decrease in critical concentration were also observed in a sedimenta - tion assay ( Fig . 6 a , inset ) . The NH 2 - terminal fragment of N - WASP protein ( Nt , residues 1 – 276 ) stabilized the fila - ments and affected the slope of the critical concentration plots of gelsolin - capped filaments exactly like the full - length protein ( Fig . 6 a ) , and bound to F - actin in sedimen - tation assays , which indicates that the Nt contains the F - actin binding site . The affinity of N - WASP for F - actin was roughly estimated to 2 to 5 10 5 M (cid:50) 1 from these data . The binding to F - actin presumably counteracted and pre - vented observation of the sequestering activity of the COOH - terminal part of N - WASP in solutions of F - actin . When barbed ends are free , the critical concentration is low ( 0 . 1 (cid:109) M ) , hence , the stabilizing effect of N - WASP ( de - crease in critical concentration ) was best observed in the presence of a sequestering protein like thymosin (cid:98) 4 .

Rates of pointed end assembly from gelsolin – actin ( (cid:115) ) and of barbed end assembly from spectrin – actin seeds ( (cid:100) ) were measured at 1 (cid:109) M G - actin and the indicated concentrations of VCA . on F eb r ua r y 23 , 2013 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published September 20 , 1999 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 146 , 1999 1328 fied by the sequestering effect of thymosin (cid:98) 4 , making any change in critical concentration easily measurable . The se - questering effect of thymosin (cid:98) 4 was drastically reduced by N - WASP , as the result of the decrease in critical con - centration ( Fig . 6 b ) . Addition of 30 (cid:109) M thymosin (cid:98) 4 to 2 (cid:109) M F - actin caused depolymerization of 1 . 28 (cid:109) M actin into thymosin (cid:98) 4 – actin complex , consistent with a value of 0 . 1 (cid:63) ( 30 (cid:50) 1 . 28 ) / 1 . 28 (cid:53) 2 . 2 (cid:109) M for the K d of the thymosin (cid:98) 4 – actin complex . Upon addition of N - WASP to this solu - tion , the concentration of F - actin at steady state increased . At saturation by N - WASP , only 0 . 5 (cid:109) M actin was unas - sembled , which , by solving the quadratic equation express - ing the combination of the laws of mass conservation and mass action , corresponded to 0 . 47 (cid:109) M thymosin (cid:98) 4 – actin complex and 0 . 03 (cid:109) M G - actin . Hence , the barbed end crit - ical concentration was decreased three - to fourfold by N - WASP . Sedimentation assays confirmed the conclusions derived from fluorescence measurements ( Fig . 6 b , inset ) . In the presence of IcsA , the binding of N - WASP to F - actin was strengthened ( Fig . 6 c ) , and N - WASP – bound IcsA then cosedimented with F - actin . In conclusion , binding of IcsA to N - WASP enhances the affinity of both its COOH - terminal domain for Arp2 / 3 complex and its NH 2 - terminal domain for F - actin . Removal of VASP Does Not Affect Actin - based Movement of Shigella To test the postulate that the binding of vinculin to IcsA would serve to recruit VASP ( Laine et al . , 1997 ) , which would have the same function in Shigella and Listeria movement , immunodepletion of VASP in platelet extracts was performed as described ( Laurent et al . , 1999 ) . Total depletion of VASP was checked by immunoblotting . The movement of E . coli ( IcsA ) precoated with N - WASP was not affected by removal of VASP ( Table I ) . Control sam - ples were prepared in parallel to verify that Listeria , in contrast , did not move at all in VASP - depleted extracts , in agreement with previous observations ( Laurent et al . , 1999 ) . In conclusion , the putative vinculin – VASP interac - tion is unlikely to play a role in Shigella movement . Profilin Is Not Required , but Enhances Actin - based Movement of Shigella Via Binding to Actin , Not to Proline - rich Proteins Depletion of profilin from platelet extracts by extensive poly - L - proline chromatography led to a 40 % decrease in the rate of propulsion of both Listeria and E . coli ( IcsA ) . Add - back of pure bovine spleen profilin ( 1 (cid:109) M ) restored 80 % of the rate measured in mock - depleted extracts . It has been postulated ( Suetsugu et al . , 1998 ; Suzuki et al . , 1998 ) that binding of profilin to the proline - rich regions of N - WASP could play a functional role in filopodium ex - tension , which is , like Shigella movement , mediated by Figure 6 .

Shigella flexneri Actin - based Motility 1329 N - WASP - induced actin polymerization . To test this pos - sibility , the add - back of profilin was performed using H133S - mutated profilin that fails to bind to poly - L - proline ( Bjorkegren - Sjogren et al . , 1997 ) . We first checked that the mutated profilin bound actin in a functional fashion strictly identical to either the bovine profilin or the recom - binant human wild - type profilin . In brief , H133S profilin sequestered actin when barbed ends were capped , partici - pated in barbed end assembly when they were uncapped , and the H133S profilin – actin complex associated to barbed ends in a growth assay ( Gutsche - Perelroizen et al . , 1999 ) at the same rate as the wild - type profilin – actin complex ( data not shown ) . H133S profilin enhanced the rate of bac - teria movement in profilin - depleted extracts to the exact same extent as bovine profilin in three reproducible exper - iments ( Table I ) , demonstrating that , by interacting direc - tly with actin and not with a proline - rich protein , profilin enhances actin - based motility . Accordingly , we recently showed ( Laurent et al . , 1999 ) that the function of profilin in Listeria movement is independent of VASP , another proline - rich protein also initially thought to act by recruit - ing profilin . Discussion The stimulation of local actin assembly by Arp2 / 3 complex in response to different stimuli is thought to be pivotal in the generation of a large diversity of cellular extensions ( lamellipodia , filopodia , neural growth cone , etc . ) , sug - gesting that a variety of connectors must link the different members of the Rho family to the Arp2 / 3 complex and ac - tivate actin polymerization by a common mechanism , with different partners . Our work shows that lessons can be learned from Shigella to understand the molecular mecha - nism of Cdc42 - induced filopodium extension mediated by actin polymerization . The IcsA – N - WASP – Arp2 / 3 Ternary Complex Is Responsible for the Stimulation of Actin Assembly at the Surface of Shigella Recently , Rohatgi et al . ( 1999 ) showed that N - WASP re - lays Cdc42 signals and directly activates the Arp2 / 3 com - plex in Xenopus egg extracts and in vitro with purified N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 complex . We extend this work to show that the Shigella IcsA protein mimics Cdc42 , to greatly enhance the affinity of N - WASP for Arp2 / 3 com - plex , thus assembling a tight IcsA – N - WASP – Arp2 / 3 ter - nary complex at the bacterial surface , in a conformation that has maximal activity in actin assembly . N - WASP acti - vation by IcsA explains why Shigella actin - based motility is independent of the Rho GTPases ( Mounier et al . , 1999 ) . Our findings , combined with results from other labora - tories ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ; Miki et al . , 1998b ; Ro - hatgi et al . , 1999 ) , can be summarized using a thermody - namic scheme expressing that : both Arp2 / 3 complex and N - WASP exist in solution in two conformations , inactive ( X ) and active ( X * ; Scheme 1 ) . The active form of Arp2 / 3 complex ( A * ) stimulates actin polymerization . The active form of N - WASP ( W * ) exposes two functionally active domains involved in actin - based motility , which may be masked in the inactive state by intramolecular interaction ( Miki and Takenawa , 1998 ; Miki et al . , 1998b ) . The VCA binds Arp2 / 3 complex and G - actin , and the NH 2 - terminal domain binds F - actin . Our data ( Fig . 6 b ) indicate that the F - actin binding site is most likely located in the WH1 do - main , which also interacts with the verprolin homologue WIP . This formulation accounts for the fact that the Arp2 / 3 complex by itself has a weak nucleating activity ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ; Machesky et al . , 1999 ) and that N - WASP by itself is able to bind F - actin and G - actin Table I .

Binding of IcsA ( I ) to N - WASP shifts the N - WASP equilibrium toward the W * form , exposing the VCA domain and the F - actin binding domain , thus en - hancing the affinity of N - WASP for active Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 4 e ) and F - actin ( Fig . 6 c ) . Binding of N - WASP to Arp2 / 3 complex shifts the Arp2 / 3 equilibrium toward the A * form , increasing the amount of nucleating complex . It is implicit here that to nucleate ac - tin polymerization , Arp2 / 3 complex binds G - actin . In the presence of IcsA and N - WASP , the Arp2 / 3 com - plex equilibrium is maximally shifted toward the A * form , in a triangular A * – W * – I complex . In this complex , pro - tein – protein bonds are formed between the three partners ( A - W , W - I , and A - I ) . Hence , each of the three compo - nents increases the stability of the complex . It is very likely that in vivo the actin - polymerization ma - chinery is highly integrated and works on an all - or - none basis , i . e . , the Arp2 / 3 complex switches from an inactive to a fully active form upon interacting with the COOH - ter - minal region of N - WASP , which itself is exposed only when Cdc42 has switched to its active conformation by binding GTP . Separating the components of this machin - ery by purification may cause structural alterations that partially unmask the protein interfaces normally buried in the inactive state . Detailed studies of the effect of solution variables on the activity of pure Arp2 / 3 complex will cer - tainly help to understand the physical – chemical basis of N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 activation . VCA has a high affinity for Arp2 / 3 complex ( a rough es - timate of 10 7 M (cid:50) 1 can be derived from the polymerization curves ) , allowing easy depletion of Arp2 / 3 from extracts and a straightforward purification procedure by affinity chromatography . At variance with a previous report ( Su - zuki et al . , 1998 ) , VCA does not appear to bind to IcsA and elicit actin polymerization at the surface of Shigella . The reason for the discrepancy with Suzuki et al . ( 1998 ) remains obscure , but may relate to the different methods used to probe the interaction . We conclude that VCA is not sufficient for IcsA binding and that this interaction probably also requires residues present outside of the VCA domain . Since WASP and N - WASP are very similar in sequence , it is surprising that WASP , which is abundant in platelets , does not appear able to bind IcsA . A possible explanation is that WASP in platelets may be in strong interaction with other ligands , competing with IcsA binding . It may be noted , in this respect , that while the CRIB domains of WASP and N - WASP are very similar in sequence , differ - ences exist in the binding of Cdc42 - Y40C ( Miki et al . , 1998b ) . Whether Cdc42 and IcsA directly compete for the same site to activate N - WASP is not known , but raises an inter - esting issue concerning the possible multiple ways of acti - vation of N - WASP . The interface of the CRIB domain of N - WASP with GMPPCP - Cdc42 is known from NMR studies ( Abdul - Manan et al . , 1999 ) . It is also known that the glycine - rich regions of IcsA are involved in the associ - ation with N - WASP ( Suzuki et al . , 1998 ) . The structural aspects of N - WASP activation await more detailed investi - gation . Like Shigella , other pathogen model systems may help discover the multiple effectors linking Arp2 / 3 com - plex to different signaling pathways . The Arp2 / 3 – N - WASP Complex Works with Actin as a Motor at the Surface of Shigella Analysis of the interaction of the COOH - terminal and NH 2 - terminal domains of N - WASP with actin provides in - sight in the mechanism by which actin polymerizes at the surface of Shigella . The two domains of N - WASP that be - come exposed upon binding to IcsA fulfill different func - tions . The COOH - terminal domain binds G - actin and Arp2 / 3 complex . The nucleation and filament branching activities of Arp2 / 3 imply that G - actin binds to Arp2 / 3 complex , perhaps by interacting with Arp2 or Arp3 ( Pantaloni , D . , manuscript in preparation ) . We propose , in agreement with Machesky and Insall ( 1998 ) and Rohatgi et al . ( 1999 ) , that the binding of G - actin in the nucleation complex is facilitated by association of the VCA domain to Arp2 / 3 complex , because in the VCA – actin complex , actin is positioned in the right orientation to interact with Arp2 / 3 , in the structure of a barbed end nucleus , hence the free energy of G - actin binding to Arp2 / 3 is lowered . Second , in the filament elongation step , while the VCA domain functions like profilin in barbed end assembly , shuttling actin subunits onto growing barbed ends , the NH 2 - terminal domain of N - WASP maintains the filament in the vicinity of Shigella surface . We propose that the two domains of N - WASP work together with actin as expected for a motor of insertional polymerization at the surface of Shigella ( Fig . 7 ) . Note that it is the treadmilling of actin fil - aments ( which is a dissipative process ) that supports unidi - rectional filament growth and promotes steady movement . N - WASP acts as a molecular ratchet that transduces actin polymerization into force . N - WASP is the first protein de - scribed thus far that possesses an integrated profilin - like Figure 7 .

Shigella flexneri Actin - based Motility 1331 function and locally lowers the critical concentration of G - actin . Whether other proteins share the same property in different cellular contexts is an exciting possibility . The observed localization of Arp2 / 3 complex in the ac - tin tail of Listeria ( Welch et al . , 1997 ) and of Shigella ( Fig . 3 in the present work ) correlates with its localization in the lamellipodium ( Bailly et al . , 1999 ; Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) . In the present work , the combination of motility as - says with the biochemical analysis of the effects of Arp2 / 3 complex and N - WASP on actin polymerization brings a functional insight into the immunolocalization studies . While N - WASP remains bound to IcsA as the bacterium is moving ( Fig . 3 ) , the Arp2 / 3 complex is activated by inter - acting with N - WASP transiently to nucleate and branch the filaments , then Arp2 / 3 complex remains incorporated in the actin meshwork as it is formed . We conclude that the Arp2 / 3 complex present in the actin tail ( and in the lamellipodium ) is no longer activated by N - WASP . This view is quite different from the currently expressed one ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ; Machesky et al . , 1999 ) . The Shigella bacterial model , therefore , proves to be a good tool to un - derstand the mechanics of lamellipodium extension . Comparison of the Listeria and Shigella actin - based mo - tility mechanisms provides interesting information on the different strategies available to induce actin assembly . Listeria does not harness a cellular activator of Arp2 / 3 complex . Instead , the ActA protein itself elicits the two functions of activated N - WASP . The central proline - rich domain of ActA binds VASP , which in turn binds F - actin , thus mediating the attachment of the filaments to the bac - terium , as does the NH 2 - terminal domain of N - WASP in Shigella . Whether the NH 2 - terminal domain of ActA , which activates nucleation by Arp2 / 3 complex , acts like VCA by interacting with the p21 - Arc subunit of Arp2 / 3 complex and with G - actin , possibly in a profilin - like fash - ion , is an open issue that may be of general relevance in the stimulation of actin assembly and which deserves in - vestigation . Remarkably , the NH 2 - terminal domain of ActA contains the acidic sequence DEWEE homologue of the DEWED in the extreme COOH - terminal region A of VCA , and a sequence KKRRKAIASS similar to the QKRSKAIHSS sequence in the cofilin homology region of VCA , but does not contain the verprolin homology re - gions present in VCA . The possibility is raised that Arp2 / 3 complex is activated in a similar way by different effectors . VASP Is Not Involved in Shigella Movement Removal of VASP from platelet extracts does not affect the movement of Shigella , while VASP is essential in the propulsion of Listeria . This result rules out the postulated mechanism according to which VASP would work , in both Shigella and Listeria systems , as a profilin recruiter , to en - hance actin assembly in an actin - based motility ( ABM ) complex ( Zeile et al . , 1998 ) . Incidentally , the physical rele - vance of that mechanism was questionable , since diffusion of profilin - actin is very fast and dissociation of profilin from a proline - rich target would introduce a kinetically limiting step in filament assembly . Overall , our results are in general agreement with the conclusion derived by Goldberg ( 1997 ) that vinculin , hence the vinculin – VASP interaction , is not required in Shigella motility . Our data further show that the function of profilin in actin - based Shigella movement is mediated by binding actin di - rectly , without interacting with the proline - rich region of N - WASP . Similarly , we demonstrated that the function of profilin in Listeria movement is independent of VASP ( Laurent et al . , 1999 ) . VASP in Listeria and N - WASP in Shigella mediate attachment of the actin tail to the bacte - rial surface . Hence , the mechanisms of movement of these two pathogens are similar in their physical principles , and some of the operators are the same ( Arp2 / 3 complex and actin ) , whereas some functions are elicited by different players . From Actin Polymerization to Movement Although the interaction of IcsA with N - WASP is essen - tial in generating Shigella motility , N - WASP - coated bacte - ria fail to actively move in a solution of F - actin at steady state in the presence of Arp2 / 3 complex . As pointed out earlier ( Carlier , 1998 ) , regulatory factors that maintain G - actin at a high steady state concentration , by regulating the dynamics of actin assembly , are important missing in - gredients in the reconstitution of movement ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ) .
