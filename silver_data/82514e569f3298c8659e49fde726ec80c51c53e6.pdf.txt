Brief Summary : Residents with COVID - 19 who were asymptomatic at testing had higher risk of mortality compared to those without COVID - 19 , even after accounting for comorbidities . Monitoring for rapid change in clinical status is critical . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 1 Abstract 1 Objective : Clinical implications of asymptomatic cases of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 2 ( COVID - 19 ) in nursing homes remain poorly understood . We assessed the association of 3 symptom status and medical comorbidities on mortality and hospitalization risk associated with 4 COVID - 19 in residents of a large nursing home system . 5 Design : Retrospective cohort study . 6 Setting and Participants : 1 , 970 residents from 15 nursing home facilities with universal COVID - 7 19 testing in Maryland . 8 Methods : We used descriptive statistics to compare baseline characteristics , logistic regression to 9 assess the association of comorbidities with COVID - 19 , and Cox regression to assess the 10 association of asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID - 19 with mortality and hospitalization . We 11 assessed the association of comorbidities with mortality and hospitalization risk . Symptom status 12 was assessed at the time of the first test . Maximum follow - up was 94 days . 13 Results : Among the 1 , 970 residents ( mean age 73 . 8 , 57 % female , 68 % Black ) , 752 ( 38 . 2 % ) were 14 positive on their first test . Residents who were positive for COVID - 19 and had multiple 15 symptoms at the time of testing had the highest risk of mortality ( HR 4 . 44 ; 95 % CI : 2 . 97 , 6 . 65 ) 16 and hospitalization ( SHR 2 . 38 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 70 , 3 . 33 ) , even after accounting for comorbidity 17 burden . Cases who were asymptomatic at testing had a higher risk of mortality ( HR 2 . 92 ; 95 % 18 CI : 1 . 95 , 4 . 35 ) , but not hospitalization ( HR 1 . 06 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 82 , 1 . 38 ) compared to those who 19 were negative for COVID - 19 . Of 52 SARS - CoV - 2 positive residents who were asymptomatic at 20 the time of testing and were closely monitored for 14 days at one facility , only 6 ( 11 . 6 % ) 21 developed symptoms . 22 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 2 Conclusions and Implications : Asymptomatic infection with SARS - CoV - 2 in the nursing home 23 setting was associated with increased risk of death suggesting a need for closer monitoring of 24 these residents , particularly those with underlying cardiovascular and respiratory comorbidities . 25 26 27 28 29 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 Introduction 30 31 Since the first outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) in a skilled nursing facility in 32 King County , Washington in February 2020 , these facilities have become epicenters for infection 33 and transmission of the disease 1 . Residents of these facilities are typically older adults and others 34 with significant baseline comorbidities , and have experienced excess mortality associated with 35 COVID - 19 2 – 5 . By June 15 2020 , over 50 , 000 residents living in skilled nursing facilities had 36 been reported dead from the 41 states reporting these data , accounting for 45 % of the total 37 reported COVID - 19 deaths statewide 6 . 38 39 High mortality from COVID - 19 infection in SNF residents and reports of rapid transmission of 40 SARS - CoV - 2 in these locations has led to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) 41 and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid ( CMS ) recommending universal testing of residents and 42 staff in facilities where one case has been identified 7 , 8 . While older adults may be particularly 43 vulnerable to poor outcomes from this infection , early reports of point prevalence surveys in 44 long - term care facilities show a significant proportion of cases identified with universal testing 45 have no documented symptoms at the time of testing 9 , 10 . 46 47 Implications and clinical relevance of asymptomatic COVID - 19 is unclear , and controversy 48 remains regarding the need for treatment or increased monitoring of these cases 11 . There have 49 been an increasing number of reports of asymptomatic nursing home residents testing positive 50 during point prevalence testing . However , there is no current guidance on how to clinically 51 manage these residents , and we still do not understand why some residents who may be 52 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 otherwise deemed high risk do not develop any signs or symptoms or have milder cases of 53 disease . 54 55 Based on case reports of COVID - 19 submitted to the CDC surveillance network , adults with 56 comorbidities such as diabetes , lung disease , or heart disease had a higher prevalence of COVID - 57 19 and may develop more severe illness 9 - 12 . However , comorbidity data was missing for over 58 half of the reported cases . Another study looking at hospitalized patients with COVID - 19 59 showed a relationship between increasing age and number of comorbidities with in - hospital 60 mortality 13 . In particular , a history of chronic kidney disease , lung disease , or cardiovascular 61 disease was associated with higher mortality 13 . Literature examining the effect of comorbidities 62 on outcomes has predominantly focused on hospitalized cohorts , or those in middle - age without 63 testing of all individuals regardless of symptoms 5 , 14 , 15 . 64 65 On April 29 , 2020 , the Maryland Governor mandated that all residents of nursing homes in the 66 State of Maryland must undergo testing for SARS - CoV - 2 . We assessed outcomes associated 67 with SARS - CoV - 2 infection among residents who were tested for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA across one 68 nursing home system with both long - term and post - acute rehabilitation services . Signs and 69 symptoms of illness were obtained at the time of testing , and risk of infection , hospitalization , 70 and death was analyzed based on symptoms and underlying comorbidities . 71 72 73 Methods 74 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 Study Population . All residents ( N = 1 , 970 ) from a large system of skilled nursing facilities who 75 were universally tested for SARS - CoV - 2 and had recorded test results between March 1 , 2020 76 and June 12 , 2020 , were included in our study . Data was obtained from respiratory surveillance 77 line list and manual chart review of the skilled nursing facility Electronic Health Record . A 78 cohort of all residents at one facility who were asymptomatic at the time of testing were closely 79 monitored by nursing home staff for development of symptoms over a 14 day period ; this was 80 documented in a dedicated line list and included as a sub - analysis . This study protocol was 81 approved by the Institutional Review Board with a waiver of written consent . 82 83 Exposure . Nasopharyngeal samples were collected at the nursing homes for reverse transcription 84 polymerase chain reaction testing for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA . When nasopharyngeal swabs were not 85 available or if the resident would only consent to oropharyngeal swabs , an oropharyngeal sample 86 was collected instead . All residents who consented to testing were tested . Residents who did not 87 consent to testing were considered positive and isolated accordingly . Symptom status at the time 88 of testing was determined based on review of respiratory surveillance line list documentation 89 maintained by nursing facility in the health system . The respiratory surveillance line list is used 90 to monitor staff and resident symptoms during a respiratory disease outbreak or cluster . This 91 monitoring tool represents each resident and staff member on a different row and tracks initial 92 symptoms if present , date of confirmatory test and other significant events , i . e . hospitalization 93 and death . Residents were added to respiratory surveillance line lists either for onset of signs or 94 symptoms or at the time of testing for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA . 95 96 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 Covariate definitions . Age was defined as age on the date of testing . Sex , race , and smoking 97 status were self - reported as recorded in the medical record . Comorbidities were abstracted based 98 on ICD - 10 codes in the medical record ( Supplemental Table S1 ) . Resuscitation preference was 99 defined based on preferences expressed on medical orders for life - sustaining treatment forms . 100 Symptomatic individuals were defined as having at least one of the following signs or symptoms : 101 fever ( temperature ≥ 100 . 4 o F ) , cough , sore throat , shortness of breath , headache , muscle aches , 102 runny nose , nasal congestion , chest congestion , vomiting , diarrhea , chills , shaking , or loss of 103 taste or smell . Asymptomatic individuals were those who did not have a documented sign or 104 symptom on or prior to their date of testing . 105 106 Outcomes . The primary outcome was death in the full cohort . Some residents did not consent for 107 hospital transfers from the nursing home . Therefore , time to first hospitalization was only 108 assessed among those who consented to hospital transfer ( N = 1 , 845 ) . Date of death or first 109 hospitalization was abstracted from respiratory surveillance line list and confirmed with manual 110 chart review . Follow - up began at the time of the resident’s first SARS - CoV - 2 test . The last date 111 of follow - up was June 16 , 2020 . Residents were censored if they were discharged home or 112 transferred to another system . 113 114 Statistical analyses . We used two sample t - tests to compare continuous variables and χ 2 tests for 115 categorical variables . Kaplan - Meier curves were used to compare hospitalization and mortality 116 risk . We used Cox regression to model time to death and Fine and Gray to model time to 117 hospitalization with death as a competing outcome . COVID - 19 status was defined based on the 118 results of the first test and symptom status was defined based on recorded symptoms at the time 119 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 of the first test . Residents who tested negative on first test remained in the negative cohort even 120 if they subsequently tested positive . Model 1 included age , sex , race , and facility . Model 2 121 included covariates in Model 1 and medical comorbidities ( asthma , chronic obstructive 122 pulmonary disease / emphysema , cancer , hypertension , atrial fibrillation , coronary artery disease , 123 heart failure , peripheral vascular disease , history of deep vein thrombus / pulmonary embolus , 124 anemia , diabetes , hypothyroidism , human immunodeficiency virus [ HIV ] , chronic hepatitis C , 125 cerebrovascular disease , dementia , stage 1 - 5 chronic kidney disease , end - stage kidney disease , 126 depression ) , or ventilator use , tracheostomy , and code status . 127 128 Results 129 There were 1 , 970 residents in 15 facilities ( median [ range ] age 73 . 9 [ 21 . 9 , 105 . 4 ] ; 57 % female ; 130 68 % Black ) who were tested at least once for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA ; of these 752 ( 38 . 2 % ) initially 131 tested positive between March 1 , 2020 and June 12 , 2020 . Of the 1 , 218 residents who initially 132 tested negative , 558 ( 45 . 8 % ) had at least 1 additional test , and 169 ( 13 . 9 % ) eventually tested 133 positive at some point before the end of follow - up . Residents who were positive for SARS - CoV - 134 2 on their first test were significantly more likely to be hospitalized and die during follow - up 135 than residents who tested negative ( Table 1 , p < 0 . 001 ) . 136 137 Demographics and Comorbidities 138 Residents were more likely to test positive for COVID - 19 if they were older , self - 139 identified as Black , were current smokers , or had certain comorbidities ( asthma , cancer , 140 hypertension , peripheral vascular disease , anemia , diabetes , dementia , renal disease , and 141 depression ) ( Table 1 ) . After accounting for age , sex , and facility ( model 1 ) , Black residents were 142 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 not at a higher risk of testing positive for SARS - CoV - 2 ( OR 1 . 07 , 95 % CI : 0 . 80 , 1 . 42 ) . 143 Peripheral vascular disease , diabetes , chronic kidney disease , and depression remained 144 significantly associated with increased risk for infection after accounting for age , sex , and 145 facility ( Table 2 ) . 146 After accounting for age , sex , race , and facility ( model 1 ) among those who tested 147 positive for SARS - CoV - 2 , coronary artery disease , heart failure , peripheral vascular disease , 148 anemia , diabetes , end - stage kidney disease , and depression were at increased risk of 149 hospitalization ( Table 2 ) . Only a history of COPD / emphysema was significantly associated with 150 higher mortality from COVID - 19 after accounting for age , sex , and facility ( Table 2 ) . 151 152 Signs and Symptoms at Time of Testing 153 Of the 752 residents who tested positive , 56 . 4 % ( n = 424 ) had no documented signs or 154 symptoms at the time of testing . Of the cases with documented signs or symptoms ( n = 328 ) , the 155 most common were fever 49 . 1 % ( n = 161 ) and cough 59 . 5 % ( n = 195 , Table 1 ) , and 56 . 4 % of 156 residents ( n = 185 ) had only 1 documented sign or symptom . Among residents with COVID - 19 , 157 those with anemia , cancer , or end - stage renal disease were more likely to have signs and 158 symptoms of illness at the time of testing and those with dementia and peripheral vascular 159 disease were more likely to be asymptomatic ( Table 1 ) . 160 Over a maximum of 94 days of follow - up , there were 475 incident hospitalizations 161 observed among the 1 , 845 residents who consented to hospital transfer from the nursing home 162 system . The 30 - day cumulative hospitalization rate was 45 % among cases with multiple 163 symptoms at testing , 35 % among cases with 1 symptom at testing , 22 % among cases 164 asymptomatic at testing , and 21 % among those who were negative . After accounting for all 165 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 confounders , cases who were symptomatic at testing remained at significantly higher risk of 166 hospitalization than those who were asymptomatic or negative ( Figure 1a ) . 167 There were 242 total deaths among the 1 , 970 residents over the 94 day follow up period ; 168 155 ( 64 % ) were in those who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 . Mortality rates were highest 169 among residents who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 and had COVID - 19 signs or symptoms 170 ( Figure 1b ) . The 30 - day cumulative mortality was 39 % among cases with 2 or more signs or 171 symptoms at testing , 27 % among cases with 1 sign or symptom at testing , 14 % among cases who 172 were asymptomatic at testing , and 7 % among those who were negative for SARS - CoV - 2 . After 173 accounting for demographics , comorbidities , and resuscitation preference ( model 2 ) , cases who 174 were symptomatic at testing remained at highest risk of mortality , and cases asymptomatic at 175 testing were at intermediate risk ( HR 2 . 92 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 95 , 4 . 35 ) compared to those who were 176 negative ( Table 3 ) . Those with multiple signs or symptoms also had a higher risk of mortality 177 compared to those with a single sign or symptom ( Model 1 HR 1 . 52 , 95 % CI : 1 . 01 , 2 . 99 ; Model 178 2 HR 1 . 52 , 95 % CI : 0 . 99 , 2 . 35 ) . 179 One facility had 52 cases who were asymptomatic at the time of testing and were closely 180 monitored for 14 days for development of signs or symptoms . Of these , only 6 ( 11 . 5 % ) 181 developed any documented symptoms over the 14 day follow up from point prevalence testing . 182 Of the 6 residents that became symptomatic , one developed a non - productive cough at day 9 post 183 diagnosis and remained stable in the facility . Three residents were hospitalized : one developed 184 malaise and shortness of breath at day 12 and was transferred to the hospital , then returned 5 185 days later ; one developed an elevated temperature ( 99 o F ) on day 10 - he was transferred to the 186 hospital on day 12 when his oxygen saturation reached 91 % and expired the next day . One 187 resident developed chills , shortness of breath , and diminished lung sounds on day 12 and expired 188 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 during transfer to the hospital . The remaining two residents passed away abruptly in the facility - 189 both were noted to rapidly develop restlessness and shortness of breath and expired shortly 190 thereafter ( one on day 6 post diagnosis and one on day 11 ) . 191 192 Discussion 193 Our findings highlight that all nursing home residents infected with SARS - CoV - 2 are at a 194 significantly higher risk of both hospitalization and death ; even if asymptomatic . Asymptomatic 195 infection has profound implications in this population as there was a higher risk of death , but not 196 hospitalization , among cases who were asymptomatic at the time of point prevalence testing 197 compared to those who tested negative for COVID - 19 . Comorbidities associated with increased 198 risk of infection after accounting for demographic factors included peripheral vascular disease , 199 diabetes , chronic kidney disease , and depression ; renal disease , diabetes and depression were 200 also associated with increased risk for hospitalization . The only comorbidity significantly 201 associated with increased risk of death after adjusting for confounders in our cohort was 202 underlying lung disease . After adjusting for facility , we did not observe differences in infection 203 rates or outcomes by race , which is consistent with observations from a hospitalized cohort in 204 Louisiana 16 . These findings have major policy implications . Multiple studies , and national and 205 state reporting data have all demonstrated that mortality from COVID - 19 is higher in 206 underrepresented minority groups . Our findings suggest that this mortality differential among 207 Blacks is predominantly due to increased prevalence , and possibly severity of underlying 208 diseases , rather than a COVID - 19 - specific cause . 209 The clinical implications of COVID - 19 detection among asymptomatic people remains 210 poorly understood 17 . The published prevalence of asymptomatic cases varies greatly from 211 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 11 population to population , ranging from 1 . 6 % in China 18 to 88 % in a Boston homeless shelter 19 . 212 In our study population of residents of long - term care facilities undergoing point prevalence 213 testing , over half of the cases detected were asymptomatic at testing , which is consistent with 214 other early reports in this setting 10 , 20 , 21 . 215 Despite a lack of documented symptoms at the time of testing , our data shows that 216 residents who are asymptomatic at testing have up to two times the mortality risk of residents 217 who test negative for SARS - CoV - 2 . However , there was no difference in risk of hospitalization 218 between residents who tested negative and asymptomatic residents who tested positive . This may 219 suggest that staff are unable to accurately elicit symptoms , or that infected individuals are 220 decompensating so rapidly that nursing home staff are not able to identify a clinical decline and 221 transfer them to a higher level of care prior to death . Indeed , residents with dementia or 222 cerebrovascular disease or history of stroke were more likely to be deemed asymptomatic than 223 others , suggesting that assessing symptom status in this population is particularly challenging 224 and may require unique attention . Nevertheless , since asymptomatic infections have important 225 clinical ramifications , including death , the objective of testing expands beyond simple case 226 finding and needs to occur frequently . 227 Paradoxically , residents with kidney disease and diabetes were more likely to be 228 symptomatic . These individuals may have more opportunities for close monitoring and screening , 229 such as prior to undergoing hemodialysis or receiving insulin or glucose checks , which increase 230 the likelihood of observing or reporting symptoms . Observations from different cohorts have 231 reported differential distributions of symptoms among older adults with COVID - 19 12 , 15 including 232 self - reported symptoms such as falls , mental status changes , and loss of appetite , leading to 233 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 recommendations from the American Medical Director’s Association for alternative screening 234 processes for COVID - 19 in this population 22 . 235 A consistent anecdotal finding in some reports investigating the pathogenesis of COVID - 236 19 is the development of hypoxia without dyspnea , or “silent hypoxia” 23 , 24 . Several reports 237 discuss a mismatch between the appearance of the patient and what is seen on the monitor , such 238 as a hospitalized patient chatting comfortably on his phone , with an oxygen saturation that is 239 considered “incompatible with life” 25 . While the underlying pathogenesis remains poorly 240 understood , this phenomenon could explain why patients in the nursing home may appear 241 comfortable without evidence of dyspnea early in the disease and decompensate rapidly when 242 oxygen saturation reaches critical levels . During this investigation , the approach to management 243 of COVID - 19 patients was still evolving . Some facilities had the capability of monitoring pulse 244 oximetry on a regular basis , however this practice was not formerly protocolized across facilities 245 and depended on the timing of the outbreak in respect to our understanding of the disease . These 246 data suggest that consistent monitoring of pulse oximetry in nursing home residents who test 247 positive for SARS - COV - 2 may be an important protocol to implement , regardless of symptom 248 status . 249 This study is subject to limitations . Comprehensive day to day symptom tracking was not 250 documented for most residents in the system and thus some of those who were defined as 251 asymptomatic may have been pre - symptomatic . This could result in a lead time bias whereby 252 asymptomatic testing detected cases earlier in their disease trajectory and thus was associated 253 with improved clinical outcomes . Estimates based on close tracking at a single facility suggests 254 that the conversion rate from asymptomatic to symptomatic was relatively low during the brief 255 follow - up . Another limitation is the known false negative rate associated with nasopharyngeal 256 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 13 and oropharyngeal swab samples for RT - PCR testing 26 . This , however , would lead to a 257 conservative bias whereby the effects detected would be smaller in magnitude as some cases may 258 be misclassified as being negative for COVID - 19 . Finally , SARS - CoV - 2 infection status and 259 COVID - 19 symptom status were treated as time - fixed in our analyses , resulting in a conservative 260 bias as those who became positive over follow - up remained in the negative group . 261 There are also several strengths of our study . Universal testing was completed at all 262 facilities regardless of symptoms or clinical suspicion for COVID - 19 mitigating concerns of 263 selection bias in testing . Furthermore , there was comprehensive documentation of comorbidities 264 for all residents . In contrast , national databases are often limited because of significant missing 265 data on comorbidity status and differences in comorbidity assessment and documentation across 266 data sources . To our knowledge , this is the largest cohort of nursing homes residents with 267 individual - level data that have been reported during the COVID - 19 pandemic ; and there was a 268 majority of Black SNF residents , while most other long - term care cohorts have historically 269 consisted of mostly white residents . 270 271 Conclusions and Implications 272 Infections with SARS - CoV - 2 detected on asymptomatic screening in the nursing home 273 setting are not benign , underscoring the importance of universal testing , especially in high - risk 274 subgroups . Reliance on signs and symptoms for SARS - CoV - 2 risk assessment alone may not be 275 sufficient , as residents living with dementia may be at a higher risk of infection but less likely to 276 report or exhibit signs and symptoms , and the natural history of this disease remains to be fully 277 established , particularly in the setting of hypoxia without dyspnea . In addition to the obvious 278 benefits of case identification to assist with infection control practices , our data suggest that 279 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 14 asymptomatic residents are at higher risk of death than residents who tested negative and may 280 benefit from close monitoring , such as regular pulse oximetry , as well as any future treatments . 281 282 283 284 285 286 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 15 References 287 288 1 .
