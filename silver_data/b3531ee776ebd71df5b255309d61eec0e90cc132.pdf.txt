Why FCLs and RAs colocalize is not known . Here , we show that FCLs assemble RAs in a process controlled by ﬁbronectin ( FN ) and its receptor , integrin α v β 5 . We observed that cells on FN - rich matrices displayed fewer FCLs and RAs . CME machinery inhibition abolished RAs and live - cell imaging showed that RA establishment requires FCL co - assembly . The inhibitory activity of FN was mediated by the activation of integrin α 5 β 1 at Tensin1 - positive ﬁbrillar adhesions . Conventionally , endocytosis disassembles cellular adhesions by internalization of their components . Our results present a novel paradigm in the relationship between these two processes by showing that endocytic proteins can actively function in the assembly of cell adhesions . Furthermore , we show this novel adhesion assembly mechanism is coupled to cell migration via a unique crosstalk between cell matrix adhesions . Introduction Integrins are nonenzymatic dimeric transmembrane receptors which recognize extracellular matrix ( ECM ) components . These mechanosensory proteins govern cell adhesion to the ECM maintaining correct tissue development and function , with elaborate connections to cellular homeostasis and disease ( Kanchanawong and Calderwood , 2023 ) . Ligand availability , and biochemical and physical properties of the ECM , determine integrin activation status , integrin clustering , and , ultimately , the formation of cellular adhesion structures ( Kechagia et al . , 2019 ) . Cells can form a variety of integrin - based adhesions . Small Integrin clusters engaged to the ECM , called nascent adhesions , form on the cell periphery and establish their connection to the actin cytoskeleton via adaptor proteins such as Talin . A balancing act of traction forces and signaling molecules determine whether nascent adhesions mature into the larger and molecularly more complex focal adhesions ( FAs ) ( Wehrle - Haller , 2012 ) . In migrating cells and in the presence of the ECM component fibronectin ( FN ) , FAs can serve as platforms for the formation of fibrillar adhesions ( FB ) , where FN - bound α 5 β 1 integrins “slide” from FAs to form FN fibrils ( Georgiadou and Ivaska , 2017 ) . In common to all these types of cell adhesions , their disassembly is mediated by the removal of integrin molecules from adhesion sites via endocytosis ( Kechagia et al . , 2019 ) . Recently , a novel type of integrin - based cell adhesion was discovered ( Lock et al . , 2018 ) . Called reticular adhesions ( RAs ) , these structures contain integrin α v β 5 , lack the typical markers for the other adhesion types , such as Talin1 or Paxillin , and are not connected to actin stress fibers . RAs can occupy a significant portion of the substrate - facing surface of cells in culture and can significantly outlast FAs . Their physiological function is , however , not clear . Intriguingly , RAs colocalize with large , persistent forms of clathrin structures at the cell membrane called Flat 1 Clathrin Lattices ( FCLs ) ( also referred to as clathrin plaques ) ( Grove et al . , 2014 ) . The structure containing FCLs and RAs is called clathrin - containing adhesion complexes ( CCAC ) ( Lock et al . , 2019 ; Zuidema et al . , 2020 ) . FCLs were previously considered as stalled endocytic events of the Clathrin - Mediated Endocytosis ( CME ) pathway . However , recent studies have changed this view and support the idea that FCLs are signaling platforms ( Leyton - Puig et al . , 2017 ; Grove et al . , 2014 ; Alfonzo - Méndez et al . , 2022 ) . In vivo , FCLs localize to adhesive structures between bone and osteoclasts ( Akisaka et al . , 2008 ) and are required for the organization of sarcomeres ( Vassilopoulos et al . , 2014 ) . The functional relationship between FCLs and RAs is not clear . A confounding factor in this relationship lies in the fact that , although FCLs always localize to RAs , the opposite is not true . RAs can occur as large structures with FCLs covering only a fraction of their area . Moreover , integrin α v β 5 can localize to both RAs and FAs . Although details on the factors mediating integrin α v β 5 localization to FCLs are becoming clearer ( Zuidema 2018 and 2022 ) , why these structures co - exist , what their function is and how cells control their formation remain a mystery . In this study , we show that FCLs are required for the establishment of RAs . Moreover , we found that a FN - rich ECM acts as an inhibitor of FCL - mediated RA formation . This inhibitory role of FN is mediated by the activation of integrin α 5 β 1 localized at fibrillar adhesions . Furthermore , we show that the transition from a static to a migratory state is mirrored by the disappearance of FCLs and RAs . Results Fibronectin inhibits the formation of FCLs While studying CME dynamics , we serendipitously observed that cells on fibronectin ( FN ) appear to display fewer FCLs when compared to cells plated on non - coated glass dishes . To confirm if ECM proteins in general can influence CME , we assessed the effect of several major ECM components as well as non - ECM coatings and non - coated surfaces on the amount of FCLs . For that , dishes were coated for 16 - 24 h after which cells were let to attach for 16 - 20 h in serum - containing medium before imaging . For quantifications , we established the metric FCL proportion , which defines the average fraction of FCLs per frame among all clathrin coated structures detected in a 5 - minute movie ( see methods for details ) . These experiments were performed using U2Os cells with an endogenously GFP - tagged alpha adaptin 2 sigma subunit ( AP2S1 , hereafter referred to simply as AP2 ) . AP2 is a widely used CME marker which faithfully mirrors clathrin dynamics ( Almeida - Souza et al . , 2018 ; Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ; Rappoport and Simon , 2008 ) . We used endogenously tagged cell lines throughout this study as the expression level of the AP2 complex was shown to modulate the amount of FCLs ( Dambournet et al . , 2018 ) . U2Os cells on non - coated dishes presented typical and abundant FCLs ( i . e . bright , long - lived AP2 - GFP marked structures ) ( Figure 1A , B , S1A and Supplementary video 1 ) , similar to what has been found in many cell lines ( Zuidema et al . , 2022 ; Moulay et al . , 2020 ; Sochacki et al . , 2021 ; Saffarian et al . , 2009 ) . Similarly , U2Os cells plated on dishes coated with the non - ECM proteins bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) and poly - L - lysine ( PLL ) also presented high FCL proportions ( Figure 1B , S1A and Supplementary video 1 ) . Out of the major ECM proteins tested , FN , collagen IV ( Col IV ) and laminin - 111 ( LN111 ) reduced FCL proportion significantly . The integrin α v β 5 ligand vitronectin ( VTN ) did not increase or decrease the FCL proportion when compared to non - coated dishes ( Figure 1B , S1A ) ( see discussion ) . Similarly , and in line with a recent study ( Baschieri et al . , 2018 ) , collagen I ( Col I ) did not reduce FCLs ( Figure 1B , S1A and Supplementary video 1 ) . Different concentrations of FN used for coating ( 10 or 20µg / ml ) did not show significant differences ( Figure 1B ) . Recently , it was described that SCC - 9 cells produce more FN when plated on Col IV or LN111 ( Lu et al . , 2020 ) . To probe if this is also the case for our cells , we stained FN from U2Os cells plated directly onto non - coated dishes , or plated on FN , VTN , Col IV , Col I or LN111 . While U2Os cells produce little FN overnight , cells plated on Col IV produced a striking amount of FN , which assembled into elongated fibrils ( Figure 1C and 1D ) . LN111 coating also induced FN production , but less strikingly than Col IV . Col I and VTN coating were unable to stimulate FN production ( Figure 1C , D ) . These results suggest that FN is the main ECM component inhibiting FCL formation . For many cell lines , it is common to find considerable variability in the amount of FCLs in culture . We thus decided to test if this variability is due to differential FN production within the culture . Confirming this hypothesis ( and bearing in mind that U2Os secrete FN modestly , see below ) , we found that cells plated on non - coated dishes displaying fewer FCLs were predominantly lying on top of a FN - rich region of the culture ( Figure S1B ) . 2 Next , we asked if the reduction in FCL proportions observed in FN - coated samples are a cell - wide effect or specific to cellular regions in direct contact with the extracellular substrate . For that , we used patterned dishes containing FN - coated regions interspersed with uncoated regions , where single U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells could adhere simultaneously to both a FN - and a non - coated region . In line with a contact - dependent effect , low FCL proportions were observed in cellular regions in contact with FN whereas FCL proportion was high in cellular regions contacting non - coated surface ( Figure 1E - G and Supplementary video 2 ) . The abundance of an alternative splice variant of the clathrin heavy chain containing exon 31 was recently shown to increase the frequency of clathrin plaques in myotubes ( Moulay et al . , 2020 ) . We thus tested if the 3 Figure 1 . Fibronectin inhibits FCL formation in a local manner .

Scalebars 10 µm . effects we observe are also due to changes in clathrin splicing , but found no difference when comparing cells plated on non - coated or FN - coated dishes ( Figure S1C ) . Thus , these results show that FN is a potent inhibitor of FCLs . Moreover , FN inhibits FCLs in a contact - dependent manner locally within a single cell ( Figure 1H ) . Fibronectin inhibits the formation of RAs in a similar manner as FCLs . As discussed in the introduction , FCLs localize to RAs . To check how ECM composition affects these structures , U2Os AP2 - GFP cells plated on FN , VTN , Col IV , Col I or LN111 and stained with the RA component integrin α v β 5 and ̶ to be able to distinguish integrin α v β 5 on RAs or FAs ̶ were also stained with an FA marker ( phosphorylated paxillin , p - PAX Y118 ) . Cells plated overnight without coating formed abundant RAs ( Figure 2A , B ) . On FN - coated dishes , big RAs were largely absent but small “dot - like” nascent RAs were present in a few cells . Similarly , on Col IV and LN111 coatings ( which stimulated FN production ) ( Figure 1C ) , cells formed significantly fewer RAs than on non - coated dishes ( Figure 2A , B ) . Coating with VTN , the ligand for integrin α v β 5 present at RAs and FAs alike ( Figure S1C ) ( Lock et al ) , did not result in more RAs ( Figure 2A , B ) . Different coatings also changed the total amount of integrin α v β 5 on the bottom surface of cells ( Figure S1D ) . However , they did not follow a clear relationship with the amount of RAs . To quantify differences in RA amounts in cells we developed a metric called RA coverage , which measures the fraction of the area of the cell covered by integrin α v β 5 signal ( excluding FAs ) . RA coverage serves as a good metric to distinguish between large and nascent RAs and , crucially , it shows a clear correspondence between RA content and 4 Figure 2 .

Scalebars 10 µm , insets 5 µm . both FCL proportion and FN abundance in the ECM ( see figures Figure 1B , 1D and 2B ) . Next , we used our substrate patterning strategy to check if the local FN effects on FCLs were also similar for RAs . Strikingly , cells plated on patterned FN revealed that RAs , akin to FCLs , were completely inhibited on cellular regions in contact with FN . Cellular regions in contact with non - coated surfaces displayed many FCLs colocalizing to RAs while regions in contact with FN presented no RAs or FCLs ( Figure 2C ) . Interestingly , in these patterned substrates , most of the integrin α v β 5 signal segregated to non - coated regions forming typical RAs ( Figure 2C , D ) . This contrasts with cells plated in fully coated dishes ( Figure 2A ) , where integrin α v β 5 can be seen in both RAs and FAs . Hence , the inhibitory effects of FN on FCLs affects RAs in a similar manner ( Figure 2E ) . The effect of fibronectin on FCLs and RAs is clear in various cell lines . Next , we checked if the effects we see in U2Os cells are also true for other cell lines . To avoid problems of 5 Figure 3 .

Scalebars 10 µm . overexpression , we endogenously tagged AP2 with either Halo tag or GFP in various human cell lines : HeLa ( epithelial , cervical carcinoma ) , MCF7 ( epithelial , breast cancer ) , HDF ( dermal fibroblast , noncancerous ) , Caco2 ( epithelial , colon carcinoma ) and hMEC ( Human mammary epithelial cells ) . These cell lines presented a large variation in the amount of FCLs and the morphology of RAs . Importantly , these cells could be divided into two groups in terms of endogenous FN secretion , and this division clearly correlated with the amount of FCLs and RAs ( Figure 3A , B ) . U2Os , HeLa and MCF7 composed the group of low FN - secretion cells . U2Os form large RAs on non - coated dishes , whereas HeLa formed multiple dot - like nascent RAs ( which colocalized with FCLs ) with bigger RAs found more seldom ( Figure 3A ) . MCF7 cells formed many FCLs and large RAs covering almost the entire cell area ( Figure 3A ) . None of the high FN - secreting cell lines ( HDF , Caco2 and hMEC ) formed large RAs ( Figure 3A , B ) . In these high FN - producing cells , small FCL / RA dots were often found in areas with less deposited FN ( Figure 3A ) . We next evaluated the response of these cell lines to FN pre - coating . In low FN - producing cell lines ( U2Os , HeLa , and MCF7 ) , RA coverage dropped significantly ( Figure 3C - E ) . Among the high FN - production cells lines , only Caco2 reduced its RA coverage on FN - coated dishes ( Figure 3C , D ) . As expected , HDF and hMEC , which had low RA coverage without coating , did not show a significant response to FN coating ( Figure 3C , E ) . For all experiments so far , we used media supplemented with serum , which is known to contain ECM components , including FN . Given that our cells are left to attach overnight in this media , it would be reasonable to expect that the FN present in serum would coat the dishes and completely mask our results . To test why this does not seem to happen ( Figures 1C and 3A ) , we compared the amount of FN deposited on the glass surface in different conditions : dishes were coated for 24 h with 10 , 5 and 1µg / ml of FN ( diluted in PBS ) , 100 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , media with 10 % FBS and PBS as a control . After coating , U2Os cells were plated and left to attach for 16 h before being fixed and stained for FN . Surprisingly , our results revealed that very little FN was deposited on glass in dishes “coated” with full media or pure FBS ( Figure S1F - G ) . These results are in line with similar experiments performed 30 years ago ( Steele et al . , 1992 ) . We hypothesize that this phenomenon occurs due to the high concentrations of BSA in serum ( 40 mg / ml ) which rapidly saturates the surface of culture dishes , thereby acting as a blocking agent for the binding of serum FN . Taken together , the presence of FN controls the formation of RAs and FCLs in a very similar manner and 6 Figure 4 . Inhibition of CME prevents RA formation . ( A ) U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells silenced for AP2 subunits alpha 1 ( AP2A1 ) , sigma 1 ( AP2S1 ) or control ( scrambled shRNA ) were plated on non - coated dishes and stained for integrin α v β 5 and p - Pax .

The CME machinery is essential for RA formation Next , we set out to dissect the relationship between the formation of FCLs and RAs . It has been shown that integrin α v β 5 is required for the establishment of FCLs ( Baschieri et al . , 2018 ; Zuidema et al . , 2018 ) . We confirmed this observation by silencing integrin β 5 from U2Os AP2 - GFP cells plated on non - coated dishes and , indeed , they displayed a significantly lower FCL proportion compared to control cells ( Figures S2A , B ) . Further , while integrin β 5 - silenced cells were unable to form RAs , they did form FAs ( Figure S2C , D ) . The dependency of integrin β 5 on FCL formation was further confirmed using Cilengitide , the inhibitor for integrin α v β 5 ( Desgrosellier and Cheresh , 2010 ) , as the treatment led to a rapid disassembly of FCLs and RAs ( Figures S2E - F ) . While all FCLs colocalize to RAs , FCL - free areas of larger RAs are rather common ( e . g . Figures 2A , 3A , 3C and S2D ) , which may give the impression that FCLs are formed on pre - existing RAs . Nevertheless , the fact that both structures are inhibited independently by FN suggests a deeper relationship and led us to ask if RAs can exist without the CME machinery . To answer this question , we quantified the RA coverage in U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells silenced for the clathrin adaptor AP2 complex subunits alpha 1 ( AP2A1 ) or sigma 1 ( AP2S1 ) in cells plated on non - coated dishes , a condition where we observe large RAs . Consistent with an important role played by the CME machinery in RA formation , AP2A1 - or AP2S1 - silenced cells ( easily recognizable as cells with little to no AP2 - GFP signal ) , did not display RAs . Instead , integrin α v β 5 localized to FAs ( Figure 4A , B ) . To confirm these results , we expressed the AP180 C - terminal fragment ( AP180ct ) , which acts as a strong dominant negative of CME ( Ford et al . , 2001 ) . AP180ct - positive U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells plated on non - coated dishes displayed low AP2 signal at the membrane and , akin to AP2 - silenced cells , RAs were largely absent with integrin α v β 5 localized to FAs , whereas AP180ct - negative cells displayed typical FCLs and RAs ( Figure 4 C , D ) . Thus , the CME machinery is required for the formation of RAs ( Figure 4E ) . Next , we set out to visualize the dynamics of AP2 during RA formation . For that , we generated a double U2Os knock - in cell line ̶ AP2 - GFP and Integrin β 5 ( ITGB5 ) - mScarlet . RAs are remarkably stable structures ( Lock et al . , 2018 ) and their de novo formation is rare , making it rather difficult to capture such events . To minimize this challenge , we optimized the conditions for Cilengitide treatment to disassemble RAs followed by a washout , when RAs could start reforming ( Figures S3A , B ) . Using these washout conditions , we were able to capture events showing that the formation and growth of ITGB5 - postive structures are accompanied by the formation of FCLs ( Figures 5A , S3C and S3D and Supplementary videos 3 and 4 ) . Also , in events where we could not clearly detect the extension of a mature RA ( reminiscent 7 Figure 5 . RAs are formed at FCLs .

Importantly , ITGB5 - postive structures , which did not colocalise with an FCL , rapidly disappeared . In many cases , this disappearance was preceded by bona fide CME events ( short lived AP2 - GFP signals ) , likely representing CME - mediated ITGB5 - cluster disassembly ( Figures 5B and S3D ) . 8 Figure 6 .

Scalebars 10 µm , insets 5 µm . Taken together , our results show that the relationship between FCLs and RAs is beyond a simple colocalization . In fact , our data reveals a strict co - dependency , where FCLs are required for the stabilization and growth of integrin α v β 5 clusters thereby establishing RAs ( Figure 5C ) . The inhibitory effect of fibronectin on FCL and RA formation is mediated by integrin α 5 β 1 . To understand the mechanism controlling the co - assembly of FCLs and RAs , we turned our attention back to FN . While integrin α v β 5 binds to VTN at FAs and RAs , the major FN receptor is integrin α 5 β 1 ( Humphries et al . , 2006 ) . First , we acutely interfered with integrin β 1 binding to FN using the function - blocking antibody mab13 . U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells seeded on FN - coated dishes were treated with mab13 and monitored for the acute formation of FCLs and RAs . Over the time course of 45 min , mab13 induced the relocalization of integrin α v β 5 from FAs to small , newly formed RAs ( Figure 6A , B ) . Further supporting the role of FCLs in RA assembly , these newly formed RAs completely colocalized with FCLs ( bright AP2 signals ) ( Figure 6A , C ) . A similar experiment followed by live - cell imaging confirmed these results and showed a gradual increase in FCL proportions after mab13 treatment ( Figure 6D ) . Mab13 treatment had no 9 Figure 7 .

In line with these results , integrin β 1 silencing in U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells plated on FN resulted in a high FCL proportion and large , prominent RAs ( Figure 7A - D and S4A - C ) . Despite the striking increase of integrin α v β 5 on the bottom surface of silenced cells , this increase was not reflected in expression levels , indicating that the stimulation of RA formation leads to a change in the trafficking of this integrin dimer ( Figure S4C ) . A significant increase in RAs was also seen in cells silenced for integrin a5 , the alpha subunit which pairs with integrin β 1 for FN binding ( Figure 7C , E and S4D , E ) . Taken together , these results show that the inhibitory activity of FN on RAs and FCLs occurs via the activation of integrin α 5 β 1 ( Figure 7F ) . Activation of integrin α 5 β 1 at fibrillar adhesions controls RA and FCL formation When bound to FN , Integrin α 5 β 1 can slide centripetally on the cell membrane , translocating from FAs to form elongated structures called fibrillar adhesions ( FB ) . This movement generates long FN fibrils in a process called FN fibrillogenesis and is mediated by the cytoskeleton scaffolding protein Tensin1 ( Pankov et al . , 2000 ) . To determine which type of adhesion structure active integrin α 5 β 1 localizes to under our experimental conditions , we plated U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells on FN and non - coated dishes and stained them with an active 10 Figure 8 . Active integrin α 5 β 1 at ﬁbrillar adhesions inhibit FCL and RA formation .

Scalebars 10 µm , insets 5 µm . integrin β 1 - specific antibody ( 12G10 ) and Tensin1 or p - Pax to mark FBs or FAs , respectively . The staining revealed that in the FN - coated dishes , active integrin β 1 was colocalizing to FBs ( Tensin1 ) ( Figure 8A ) . As expected , active integrin β 1 and Tensin1 - positive adhesions were largely absent in non - coated dishes ( Figure 8A ) . Next , to determine which active integrin β 1 pool is more important for the inhibition of FCLs and RAs , we silenced FAs and FB components on U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells and plated them on FN . In accordance with the higher accumulation of active integrin β 1 in FBs , silencing of Tensin1 led to a marked increase of RAs and FCLs accompanied by a reduction in the presence of active integrin β 1 on the membrane ( evidence by 12G10 antibody staining ) ( Figure 8B , C and S5A - C ) . Silencing of the FA component Talin - 1 also led to increased RAs and FCLs and a reduction of active integrin β 1 on the membrane ( Figure S5D - F ) . Given the strong phenotype on Tensin1 knockdown , this result was expected as FAs are precursors of FBs . FB formation indicates activated and migratory cell phenotypes . Indeed , active sliding of integrin α 5 β 1 and Tensin1 bound to FN along central actin stress fibers increases traction forces ( Georgiadou and Ivaska , 2017 ; Pankov et al . , 2000 ) and is required in cell migration during development and cancer metastasis ( Efthymiou et al . , 2020 ; Schwarzbauer and DeSimone , 2011 ) . If the extension of active integrin α 5 β 1 into FBs is indeed required for the inhibition of FCLs and RAs , we hypothesized that physical confinement of cells — which inhibits cell migration — would also inhibit the sliding of FB from FAs . In turn , the absence of integrin α 5 β 1 in FBs would favor FCLs and RAs , even if cells were plated on an FN - rich matrix . To test this possibility , we turned to single cell micropatterns . In contrast to the patterned coatings we used in Figures 1 and 2 , these micropatterns do not allow cells to attach outside the defined areas on a coverslip . Given the small size of these areas ( 1100 µm 2 ) , cells are laterally confined . U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells were plated on slides with arrow - and H - shaped micropatterns either precoated with FN or not and stained for integrin α v β 5 and p - PAX and imaged to measure RA coverage . In addition , to measure integrin β 1 activation , U2Os - AP2 - GFP - ITGB5 - mScarlet cells were plated similarly and stained for active integrin β 1 . Supporting our hypothesis , we could detect clear FCL and RAs in FN - coated micropatterns ( Figure 9A , B , S5K ) . On arrows , FCLs and RAs developed on the shaft of the pattern , rather than the arched area . In the H - patterns , FCLs and RA developed all over the pattern . Cells on non - coated patterns made large FCLs and RAs often extending throughout the pattern ( Figure 9A , B ) . Crucially , the RA coverage was not significantly different between coated or non - coated patterns ( Figure 9B ) . As expected , staining with active integrin β 1 ( 12G10 ) showed a clear difference in signal between FN - coated and non - coated patterns ( Figure 9C , S5L ) . Importantly , further supporting a need for FB formation to inhibit FCLs and RAs , 12G10 signal was not organized as elongated , central FBs but rather confined at the cell periphery ( Figure S5K ) . Thus , the inhibitory role of FN on FCLs and RA formation occurs primarily via the activation of integrin α 5 β 1 on Tensin1 - positive fibrillar adhesions . The disassembly of FCL / RA is coupled to cell migration As physical restriction favored FCLs and RAs , we wondered if inducing migration will have the opposite effect . To test this hypothesis , we monitored FCLs and RAs in a classic wound healing assay . U2Os - AP2 - GFP - ITGB5 - mScarlet cells were plated on non - coated dishes and allowed to grow to full confluency for 2 days . Cultures were then wounded and cells were allowed to migrate . At 0 minutes ( i . e . just after wounding ) , FCLs and RAs were abundant and equally distributed at the edge and away from the wound ( Figure 9D ) . Within 80 minutes , the cells at the migration front had lost most of their FCLs and RAs , while cells further away from the edge maintained their FCLs and RAs ( Figure 9D ) . At 4 hours , as the migratory front grew larger , the loss of FCL and RAs also extended away from the wound ( Figure 9D ) . In full accordance with the results we presented above , the disappearance of FCLs and RAs was preceded by the increase in FN secretion by the cells at the edge of the wound ( Figure 9E , F ) . Together , these results place the resolution of FCLs and RAs as an intrinsic part of the cascade of events triggering cell migration ( Figure 9G ) . Discussion The extracellular environment is a key regulator of cellular physiology with integrins playing a key role translating the chemical composition of the extracellular milieu into intracellular signals . Among various mechanisms controlling integrin function , integrin trafficking via endocytosis and exocytosis plays a major role ( Moreno - Layseca et al . , 2019 ) . Thus far , the relationship between integrin - based matrix adhesions and endocytosis has been considered primarily antagonistic , with endocytosis playing a role in the disassembly of said adhesive structures ( Ezratty et al . , 11 12 Figure 9 .

Scalebars 10 µm , except in D 50 µm , and inset 10 µm . 2009 ; Moreno - Layseca et al . , 2019 ) . Here we provide evidence , for the first time , of a constructive relationship between the endocytic machinery and cellular adhesions , where the CME machinery , in the form of FCLs , is key for the formation of integrin α v β 5 RAs . Moreover , we show that FCL - mediated α v β 5 RA formation is counteracted by the activation of a distinct integrin heterodimer , α 5 β 1 , in distinct adhesion structures , FBs , revealing an interesting mechanism of inter - adhesion crosstalk . Our results support the idea that FCLs and RAs are two sides of the same structure ( Lock et al . , 2019 ; Zuidema et al . , 2020 ) . Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of integrin α v β 5 at RAs in the formation of FCLs ( Zuidema et al . , 2022 , 2018 ; Lock et al . , 2019 ) . Here , we show that this relationship is also crucial in the other direction , with FCLs being required for the formation of integrin α v β 5 RAs . Therefore , we believe the previously suggested term clathrin containing adhesion complexes ( or CCAC for short ) is a more appropriate terminology to refer to these structures . The mechanism of FCL - mediated RA formation We observed that FCL - mediated RA formation events are rare , which led us to use non - physiological conditions ̶ a Cilengitide washout experiment ̶ to detect them . Therefore , the physiological trigger leading to the formation of FCLs and establishment of RAs remains to be understood . VTN , the ligand for integrin α v β 5 could be considered a good candidate . However , as we show in figure 2E and as reported by others ( Zuidema et al . , 2022 ) , integrin α v β 5 binds VTN equally on FAs and RAs . While it is clear that the presence of VTN is important as an extracellular tether for the formation of integrin α v β 5 adhesions ( Zuidema et al . , 2022 , 2018 ; Lock et al . , 2018 ) , the switch between these adhesion types is likely an inside - out mechanism . We did not detect an increase in integrin α v β 5 RAs on VTN - coated dishes ( Figure 1B ) . This could seem counterintuitive , but VTN ̶ which was initially called “serum spreading factor” ( Hayman et al . , 1983 ) ̶ is readily secreted by cells during attachment . Therefore , we advise caution when making conclusions based on the results of non - coated and VTN - coated dishes on the role of this ECM component on RA coverage . Further work is necessary to shed light on this issue . Recent evidence showed that EGFR activation led to the enlargement of FCLs in an integrin β 5 phosphorylation - dependent manner ( Alfonzo - Méndez et al . , 2022 ) , pointing to a possible mechanism for the initial co - assembly of FCLs and RAs . This possibility is further reinforced by the fact that the relationship between growth factor receptors and integrins has been established in multiple contexts ( Ivaska and Heino , 2011 ) . Another key unknown aspect of FCL - mediated RA formation concerns how these structures can be molecularly differentiated from canonical endocytic events . The connection between integrin α v β 5 located in RAs and FCLs occurs primarily via the endocytic adaptors ARH and NUMB ( Zuidema et al . , 2018 ) . Importantly , these adaptors also participate in integrin endocytosis ( Ezratty et al . , 2009 ; Nishimura and Kaibuchi , 2007 ) , suggesting that other mechanisms may be required to define the identity of FCLs . Recently , a correlation was found between the presence of clathrin plaques and an alternatively spliced isoform of clathrin containing exon 31 in myotubes ( Moulay et al . , 2020 ) . We did not detect any changes in clathrin splicing in our experimental system , which was not surprising given the effects we see are contact - dependent and could not be explained by transcriptional changes . In addition , we cannot ensure that the clathrin plaques detected in myotubes are equivalent to the FCLs we observe here . Nonetheless , it is possible that the abundance of the exon 31 - positive clathrin isoform works as a dial that changes the probability , speed or efficiency by which cells form FCLs . Another unusual function for the clathrin machinery In addition to its endocytic function , the clathrin machinery has been shown to participate in other processes . For example , clathrin helps to stabilize the mitotic spindle by binding to microtubules ( Royle , 2012 ) and , during E . coli infection , the CME machinery is co - opted to form a clathrin - based actin - rich adhesive structure for the bacteria called a pedestal ( Veiga et al . , 2007 ) . Furthermore , a clathrin / AP2 tubular lattice was recently described to envelop collagen fibers during cell migration ( Elkhatib et al . , 2017 ) . The results we present here add to this list of non - endocytic functions of CME components with an important twist . FCLs can also be disassembled into individual endocytic events ( Lampe et al . , 2016 ; Tagiltsev et al . , 2021 ; Maupin and Pollard , 1983 ) , providing an elegant and efficient mechanism for cells to switch the same machinery from an adhesion assembly to an adhesion disassembly function . Inhibition of clathrin - containing complexes ( CCAC ) and its relationship to cell migration In addition to defining FCLs as key factors in the establishment of CCACs , our work has also revealed many interesting aspects on the inhibition and disassembly of these structures . We show that activation 13 of integrin α 5 β 1 by FN and the capacity of this integrin heterodimer to slide on the plasma membrane to form fibrillar adhesions are both essential conditions for the inhibition and disassembly of CCAC . In a classical wound healing assay , we observed that as cells start to migrate they secrete FN , leading to the disappearance of CCACs . However , using laterally confined cells ̶ which cannot form fibrillar adhesions ̶ we observed that the mere presence of FN is not enough to inhibit CCACs . A recent study showed that high levels of activated myosin light chain ( p - MLC ) correlated with integrin α v β 5 localizing to FAs over RAs ( Zuidema et al . , 2022 ) . Moreover , overexpression of a constitutively active RhoA mutant in a cell line with low p - MLC levels promoted integrin α v β 5 localization to FAs ( Zuidema et al . 2022 ) . As Integrin α 5 β 1 - mediated FN fibrillogenesis is required for optimal activation of the RhoA - MLC pathway , which in turn increase actin stress fiber - based migration along fibrillar adhesions ( Gagné et al . , 2020 ; Huveneers et al . , 2008 ; Danen et al . , 2002 ) , these findings perfectly complement our data . Together , these results suggest that the disappearance of CCACs is the result of a computation of multiple cellular signals occurring during the cell migration process . Whether the disassembly of CCACs occurs actively or is a mere consequence of a non - permissive environment for the de novo formation of new adhesions is still unknown . Given the fact that RAs are long - lasting cellular adhesion structures , it is tempting to hypothesize that these structures act as a “parking brake” for a cell . As the cell is triggered to migrate , this “brake” needs to be released for efficient cell movement . This process would be analogous to the loss of cell - cell contacts which happens during epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( Kalluri and Weinberg , 2009 ) , but instead of happening between cells , it would happen between the cell and the ECM . Therefore , we propose that disassembly of RAs is an intrinsic process during cells migration . We showed that FN regulates CCAC assembly in all the cell lines we tested . However , how these in vitro findings will operate in vivo is still unknown . Even though the ECM composition in tissues is complex , the FN effect on CCAC formation is local and strictly contact dependent , which opens the possibility that , in vivo , tissues may use focal changes in ECM composition to control these structures .

HDF - AP2 - halo and Caco2 - AP2 - halo were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Gibco ) and penicillin - streptomycin ( 100 U / ml , Thermo Scientiﬁc ) . MCF7 - AP2 - halo was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Gibco ) and penicillin - streptomycin ( 100 U / ml , Thermo Scientiﬁc ) , 2mM glutamine , 5 µg / ml human insulin and 1µM sodium pyruvate . hMEC - AP2 - GFP was cultured in MEGM complete medium ( Lonza ) . The following primary antibodies were used : anti - human integrin β 1 clones 12G10 ( Novus bio , NB100 - 63255 ) , mAb13 ( BD , 552828 ) , and total integrin β 1 ( MAB2252 , Millipore ) , anti - human integrin α v β 5 clone 15F11 ( Millipore MAB2019Z ) , anti - human integrin a5 clone SNAKA51 ( R & D , AF1846 ) , anti - human Tensin1 ( SAB4200283 , Sigma ) , anti - human p - paxillin Y118 ( Cell Signaling , 69363 ) , anti - human - Talin1 ( T3287 , Sigma ) , anti - a - tubulin ( sc - 32293 , SantaCruz Biotechnology ) , and anti - GAPDH ( G9545 , Sigma ) . Corresponding secondary antibodies raised against rabbit or mouse IgG were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch . Coating of imaging dishes To compare the effects of major extracellular matrix proteins on AP2 life - time , the glass coverslip areas ( 14 mm diameter ) of imaging dishes ( Mattek ) were pre - coated with 10 or 20 µg / ml ( 300 µl in PBS ) , of the following ECM proteins : recombinant human ﬁbronectin ( Merck , 341631 ) , recombinant human vitronectin ( PeproTech , 140 - 09 ) , collagen IV ( Santa cruz , se - 29010 ) , collagen I ( Sigma , C3867 ) and laminin - 111 ( Biolamina , # LN111 ) . Coatings were incubated overnight at + 37°C , except Col I was incubated in RT overnight , and LN111 was incubated in + 4°C overnight . Alternatively , as non - ECM protein controls , 1 % BSA ( Thermo Fisher , A34785 ) or 0 . 3 % poly - L - lysine ( MP Biochemicals , 152690 ) were used to coat the dishes overnight at + 37°C . Throughout this study , the standard FN coating was always performed similarly , 10 µg / ml ( 300 µl in PBS ) , overnight at + 37°C . FN patterning To study local vs . global effects of FN , FN was mixed with 50 ng / ml of Alexa647 - labelled BSA and used to precoat the imaging dishes overnight in + 37°C . The coated surface was subsequently scratched with a needle to allow partial reappearance of non - coated surface . After scratching , the dishes were heavily rinsed with PBS . 20 000 U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells were seeded on patterned imaging dishes to ensure sufﬁcient single - cell attachment to border areas . Overexpression of mammalian proteins The clathrin inhibitor AP180 c - terminal fragment ( AP180ct ; amino acids 516 - 898 ) cDNA , from rat origin , was described previously ( Ford et al . , 2001 ) . This construct was cloned into Gateway compatible pCI vectors , containing an N - terminal monomeric EGFP using the Gateway system . Transient transfections were carried out with PEI MAX transfection reagent ( Polysciences , 24765 - 1 ) using 70 % conﬂuent U2Os cells . 17 Genetic engineering of cell lines Generating the U2Os - AP2 - GFP and hMEC - AP2 - GFP cell lines Three guide RNA ( gRNA ) sequences ( Integrated DNA Technologies ) were designed using the Welcome Sanger Institute Genome online editing tool ( https : / / wge . stemcell . sanger . ac . uk / / https : / / wge . stemcell . sanger . ac . uk / ) . gRNAs were cloned into pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2A - Puro ( PX459 ) V2 . 0 ( gift from . Feng Zhang , Addgene # 62988 ) using BbsI sites and conﬁrmed by Sanger sequencing . gRNAs were transfected with the donor template for homologous recombination and the most effective gRNA ( TGCTACAGTCCCTGGAGTGA ) , judged by the percentage of ﬂuorescent cells by FACS , was used for single clone selection , genotyping and conﬁrmation by microscopy .

Generating the U2Os - AP2 - GFP - ITGB5 - mScarlet cell line This cell line was produced by the same protocol as the U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells with the following changes : The gRNA sequence was CAAATCCTACAATGGCACTG , and the donor template was : GGTTTGAGTGTGTGAGCTAACATGTGTCCTCATCCTCTTCCCCGCCGTGTTCTGTAGGCTTCAAATCCATTATACAGAAAGCCTATCTCCACGCACACTGTGGACTTCA CCTTCAACAAGTTCAACAAATCATATAACGGCACTGTTGACGGAAGTGCATCTGGGAGCTCAGGCGCTAGTGGTTCAGCGAGCGGGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGC AGTGATCAAGGAGTTCATGCGGTTCAAGGTGCACATGGAGGGCTCCATGAACGGCCACGAGTTCGAGATCGAGGGCGAGGGCGAGGGCCGCCCCTACGAGG GCACCCAGACCGCCAAGCTGAAGGTGACCAAGGGTGGCCCCCTGCCCTTCTCCTGGGACATCCTGTCCCCTCAGTTCATGTACGGCTCCAGGGCCTTCATCAAG CACCCCGCCGACATCCCCGACTACTATAAGCAGTCCTTCCCCGAGGGCTTCAAGTGGGAGCGCGTGATGAACTTCGAGGACGGCGGCGCCGTGACCGTGACC CAGGACACCTCCCTGGAGGACGGCACCCTGATCTACAAGGTGAAGCTCCGCGGCACCAACTTCCCTCCTGACGGCCCCGTAATGCAGAAGAAGACAATGGGC TGGGAAGCATCCACCGAGCGGTTGTACCCCGAGGACGGCGTGCTGAAGGGCGACATTAAGATGGCCCTGCGCCTGAAGGACGGCGGCCGCTACCTGGCGG ACTTCAAGACCACCTACAAGGCCAAGAAGCCCGTGCAGATGCCCGGCGCCTACAACGTCGACCGCAAGTTGGACATCACCTCCCACAACGAGGACTACACCG TGGTGGAACAGTACGAACGCTCCGAGGGCCGCCACTCCACCGGCGGCATGGACGAGCTGTACAAGTAATGTTTCCTTCTCCGAGGGGCTGGAGCGGGGATCT GATGAAAAGGTCAGACTGAAACGCCTTGCACGGCTGCTCGGCTTGATCACAGCTCCCTAGGTAGGCACCACAGAGAAGACCTTCTAGTGAGCCTGGGCCAGGA GCCCACAGTGCCT where A = silent mutations in 5’ HA , linker region is in purple , and mScarlet is in orange . Lentiviral shRNA production and transduction Lentiviruses for shRNA production were produced using packaging plasmids pCMVR and pMD2 . g and speciﬁc shRNAs in pLKO . 1 vector as follows : 80 % conﬂuent HEK293T cells in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS and 100U penicillin - streptomycin were transfected using PEI MAX transfection reagent . 5 hours later , the medium was changed to DMEM supplemented with 4 % FBS and 25mM HEPES . Media containing lentiviral particles were harvested after 48 and 72 hours , ﬁltered ( 0 . 45 µm ) , aliquoted and stored at - 80°C . U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells were transduced with lentiviral media expressing respective shRNAs in the presence of Polybren 8 µg / ml ( Sigma - Aldrich , TR - 1003 ) for 5 hours , and replaced with culture medium . 48 h later , puromycin ( 1 µg / ml ) was added for 24 h to allow selection 19 of transduced cells . Experiments targeting AP2 subunits were performed otherwise similarly but without puromycin selection . All shRNA - silenced cell lines were replated on non - coated glass - bottomed imaging dishes one day prior to imaging . The following sequences were targeted : Integrin β 5 targeting ( ITGB5 ) shRNAs : TRCN0000057744 ( GCATCCAACCAGATGGACTAT ) , TRCN0000057745 ( GCTGTGCTATGTTTCTACAAA ) Integrin β 1 targeting ( ITGB1 ) shRNAs : TRCN0000029644 ( CCTGTTTACAAGGAGCTGAAA ) , TRCN0000029645 ( GCCTTGCATTACTGCTGATAT ) AP2 sigma 1 targeting ( AP2S1 ) shRNAs : TRCN0000060263 ( GACGCCAAACACACCAACTTT ) , TRCN0000060266 ( GTGGAGGTCTTAAACGAATAT ) , TRCN0000060267 ( CACAACTTCGTGGAGGTCTTA ) .

Next day , U2Os cells were plated to reach conﬂuency in 24 h . RNA extraction , cDNA synthesis , and PCR followed those described by Moulay et al . ( 2020 ) with minor variations . Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol reagent with an additional acidic phenol ( pH 5 . 4 ) extraction step to remove genomic DNA contamination . cDNA synthesis from 1 µg total RNA was carried out using Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) and oligo dT12 – 18 ( Life Technologies ) . No enzyme reactions were included to conﬁrm that no genomic DNA was present . PCR was performed using Phusion High - Fidelity DNA polymerase ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) with no other variations from Moulay et al . , ( 2020 ) . Primers used were : F’ TGC CCT ATT TCA TCC AGG TCA , R’ ATG GGT TGT GTC TCT GTA GC . Gel images were acquired using a GelDoc XL ( Bio Rad ) . Western blots U2Os were silenced for respective proteins as mentioned above , and lysed into 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris pH8 and 1 % Igepal ( Sigma ) . Protein concentrations were measured with the Pierce BCA kit ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) , and boiled in Laemmli loading buffer with 10 % mercaptoethanol . Equal amounts of protein lysates were loaded onto SurePAGE Bis - Tris 4 - 20 % gels ( Genscript ) and transferred either to 0 . 2 µm PVDF or 0 . 45 µm nitrocellulose ( GE Healthcare ) membranes . Membranes were blocked in 5 % BSA or skimmed milk for 1 h , incubated with primary antibodies at + 4°C overnight , and HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies ( 1706516 , 1721019 , Biorad ) for 1 h in RT . HRP was activated with Supersignal West Femto or Pico reagents ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) and bands were detected with ChemiDoc XRS + ( BioRad ) . 20 Microscopy All live videos and images from ﬁxed samples were acquired with the ONI Nanoimager microscope equipped with 405 , 488 , 561 and 647 lasers , an Olympus 1 . 49NA 100x super achromatic objective and a Hamamatsu sCMOS Orca ﬂash 4 V3 camera .

Alternatively , shRNA - silenced cell lines were plated . After overnight culture , 25 µM HEPES was added and samples were subjected to live TIRF imaging in a pre - heated + 37°C chamber . The ONI nanoimager microscope set to TIRF angle was used to acquire AP2 lifetimes at the cell membrane from 300 frames ( 1 frame / s ) with the exposure time of 330 ms . Each video represents endocytic events from 2 - 3 cells ( total ﬁeld of view ) . Acute manipulation of integrin activity Integrin β 1 blocking Acute modulation of ligand binding activity for integrin β 1 was achieved using the function blocking antibody mab13 ( 0 . 3 µg / ml ) . U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells were plated on FN as explained above , and 16 - 20 h later subjected to live TIRF imaging . 0 min sample has no mab13 added , to control base - line FCL proportions . Immediately after mab13 addition , 5 min time lapses were continuously collected until 35 min , control videos ( time point 0 ) had no mab13 added . Integrin β 5 blocking To acutely induce the inhibition of integrin α v β 5 we used the small molecular inhibitor Cilengitide ( MedChem Express HY - 16141 , 10 µM ) . U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells plated on non - coated imaging dishes were treated with Cilengitide for 15 or 45 min , ﬁxed , stained , and imaged with the ONI nanoimager microscope at TIRF angle , and analyzed for the resulting reduction of RA coverage . Cilengitide washout U2Os - AP2 - GFP - ITGB5 - mScarlet cells were plated on non - coated imaging dishes and 1 d later conﬂuent monolayers were treated with 1 µM Cilengitide for 15 - 25 min , during which most FCLs and RAs were dissociated from the cell membrane . Samples were then washed twice and immediately subjected to live TIRF imaging to detect the de novo formation of FCLs and RAs . 1 h time - lapses were acquired with the ONI nanoimager microscope at TIRF angle , at 30 s intervals , with an exposure time of 100 ms for AP2 and 300 ms for integrin β 5 . Immunofluorescence experiments Immunoﬂuorescent staining and imaging For immunoﬂuorescence experiments , cells were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde - PBS for 15 min in a + 37°C incubator , washed with PBS and blocked with 1 % BSA - PBS . Primary antibodies diluted in 1 % BSA - PBS were incubated for 1 h , samples were washed with PBS , and secondary antibodies diluted in 1 % BSA - PBS were let to bind for 30 min . Samples were imaged with the ONI nanoimager microscope using TIRF angle and exposure times of 500 ms or 1000 ms . 21 Manipulation of CME machinery to study RA formation Clathrin assembly at the cell membrane was reduced by silencing two subdomains of AP2 , or by overexpressing AP180ct , which acts as a dominant negative for AP2 . U2Os AP2 - GFP cells silenced for AP2A1 shRNA # 1 and # 2 or AP2S1 shRNA # 1 , # 2 and # 3 , and control shRNA , and plated on non - coated imaging dishes were ﬁxed and stained for integrin α v β 5 and FA marker p - Pax . Alternatively , AP180ct was overexpressed in U2Os AP2 - GFP cells and cells were plated on non - coated imaging dishes , ﬁxed the next day , and stained for integrin α v β 5 and p - Pax . RA formation ( integrin α v β 5 adhesions w / o FA marker ) and FAs ( integrin α v β 5 colocalising with FA marker ) were imaged using TIRF microscopy . Manipulation of integrin activity and availability We performed time - series experiments to block integrin β 1 active conformation with the mab13 antibody or to inhibit integrin α v β 5 with Cilengitide . Experiments utilizing mab13 were performed with U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells plated on FN - coated dishes to disfavour the preformation of FCLs and RAs . Mab13 ( 0 . 3 µg / ml ) was added to replicate samples and ﬁxed 15 , 30 or 45 min later . Similarly , U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells plated on non - coated dishes to favour the preformation of FCLs and RAs were treated with Cilengitide . Samples were stained for integrin α v β 5 and FA marker p - Pax , and imaged using TIRF microscopy . Cilengitide washout Cilengitide washout experiments were developed to study acute reappearance of FCLs and RAs in cell cultures . Cells were treated for 15 - 25 min with 1 µM Cilengitide ( or DMSO as control ) and washed two times . Unwashed controls were collected . Washed samples were let to recover for indicated time points , ﬁxed , stained for p - Pax , subjected to TIRF imaging , and analysed for the reappearance of FCLs and RAs ( RA coverage ) . U2Os - AP2 - GFP cells silenced for integrin β 1 , integrin β 5 , integrin α 5 or Tensin1 and controls were plated either on FN coated dishes ( control shRNA and ITGB1 shRNAs , ITGA5 shRNAs or TNS1 shRNAs ) or on non - coated dishes ( control shRNA and ITGB5 shRNAs ) , and ﬁxed the next day , 16 - 20 h later . Samples were stained for integrin α v β 5 and FA marker p - Pax and imaged using TIRF microscopy . Micropatterning U2Os - AP2 - GFP or U2Os - AP2 - GFP - ITGB5 - mScarlet cells were seeded onto micropatterned glass coverslips ( CYTOO ) either precoated with FN 10 µg / ml or left uncoated . Excess amount ( 60 000 ) of cells were plated , and monitored for attachment to the patterns . The cells plated on FN had attached in 1 h , and the cells plated on non - coated micropatterns had attached in 4 h . After attachment , excess cells were carefully rinsed , and the samples were ﬁxed 16 - 20 h later , stained , and subjected to immunoﬂuorescence analysis with TIRF microscopy . Wound healing - stimulated migration U2Os - AP2 - GFP - ITGB5 - mScarlet cells were plated conﬂuent onto non - coated imaging dishes for 2 days . Fully conﬂuent monolayers were wounded with a micropipette tip , washed twice with fresh complete medium and let to migrate . 0 min samples were collected directly after wounding . After ﬁxing , samples were stained and subjected to TIRF imaging . Tile images ( 5x1 ) , starting at the edge of the wound were acquired with a 25 % overlap and stitched using the pairwise stitching plug - in Image J . 22 Image analyses CME lifetime analyses ( FCL proportion ) To track CME events and measure lifetimes we used ' u - track 2 . 0 ' multiple - particle tracking MATLAB software at default settings ( Jaqaman et al . , 2008 ) . For all experiments , “n” refers to a movie , which contained 2 - 4 cells . To determine the proportion of FCLs , we used the output from u - track to count the number of pits ( events lasting longer than 20 s and shorter than 120 s ) and the number of FCLs ( events lasting longer than 120 seconds , as described in ( Saffarian et al . , 2009 ) in all frames . We took a conservative approach to identify CCPs , where events that were present at the start or lasted beyond the end of the movies were not counted as CCPs . This approach artiﬁcially led to higher FCL proportions in the ﬁrst and ﬁnal 120 movie frames . Therefore , FCL proportions are presented as the average FCL proportion from frames 120 to 175 for each movie . Other analyses With the exception of FCL proportions , all image analyses were performed using ImageJ . Simple ﬂuorescence measurements were done manually . Others were performed using custom scripts as shown below : RA coverage Individual cells were marked and ITGB5 ( or α v β 5 ) and p - Pax channels were segmented using the Robust Automatic Threshold Selection function . RAs were deﬁned as ITGB5 ( or α v β 5 ) signals not colocalizing with p - Pax . The area of RAs was then divided by the area of each marked cell to obtain RA coverage . Data is presented as percentage of the cell area covering RAs . For the wound healing experiment , a line on the migration front of each image was manually drawn . This line was then used as a reference to automatically draw a box , 100 pixels in width ( 11 . 7 µm ) . RA coverage ( as above ) was calculated for this box , which was then moved inward in the culture in 50 pixels steps , where the RA coverage analysis was repeated . Values are normalized to the average RA coverage on the three innermost areas in the culture . AP2 - ITGB5 dynamics Events showing the appearance of both AP2 and ITGB5 were identiﬁed by visual inspection of videos . For the generation of graphs , we selected only events where we could unambiguously ensure that signiﬁcant FCLs and ITGB5 signals were not present in the region for at least 3 minutes . Time zero was deﬁned as the frame where AP2 signal appeared and ﬂuorescence Intensity from a 10 µm x 10 µm region around each event was measured for 3 min before ( six frames ) and 5 min after ( 10 frames ) . Fluorescence was normalised to the highest value in these frames . AP2 intensity per colocalisation status AP2 , ITGB5 and p - Pax channels were segmented using the Robust Automatic Threshold Selection function . Each segmented AP2 spot had the ﬂuorescence intensity measured from the original image and classiﬁed for its colocalisation with either marker ( ITGB5 or p - Pax ) . We used full images for these analyses . RAs colocalising to AP2 Individual cells were marked and AP2 , ITGB5 and p - Pax channels were segmented using the Robust Automatic Threshold Selection function . RAs were deﬁned as ITGB5 signals not colocalizing with p - Pax . In the conditions used for these experiments , ( FN + mab13 ) RAs 23 were primarily individual spots . The colocalisation of RAs to AP2 was classiﬁed by measuring the intensity of each RA region at the segmented AP2 channel . FN intensity vs . AP2 intensity AP2 , ITGB5 and P - PAX channels were segmented using the Robust Automatic Threshold Selection function . Each segmented AP2 spot had the ﬂuorescence intensity measured from the original image . A 3 µm x 3 µm region was drawn around each AP2 spot and used to measure the intensity of FN from the original image . Data is presented as the ﬂuorescence for each AP2 spot . Statistics Figure legends state the exact n - values and individual repeats used in analyses . For multiple comparisons one - way ANOVA was performed followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison . Pairwise comparisons were performed using two - tailed Student’s t - test with equal variance . All graphs and statistical calculations were performed with GraphPad Prism 9 . 24
