Salamone 1 Received : 14 April 2020 / Accepted : 1 June 2020 # Springer - Verlag GmbH Germany , part of Springer Nature 2020 Abstract Rationale Effort - based decision - making tasks allow animals to choose between preferred reinforcers that require high effort to obtain vs . low - effort / low reward options . Mesolimbic dopamine ( DA ) and related neural systems regulate effort - based choice . Tetrabenazine ( TBZ ) is a vesicular monoamine transport type - 2 inhibitor that blocks DA storage and depletes DA . In humans , TBZ induces motivational dysfunction and depression . TBZ has been shown reliably to induce a low - effort bias in rats , but there are fewer mouse studies . Objectives The present studies used touchscreen operant procedures ( Bussey - Saksida chambers ) to assess the effects of TBZ on effort - based choice in mice . Methods C57BL6 mice were trained to press an elevated lit panel on the touchscreen on a fixed ratio 1 schedule reinforced by strawberry milkshake , vs . approaching and consuming a concurrently available but less preferred food pellets ( Bio - serv ) . Results TBZ ( 2 . 0 – 8 . 0 mg / kg IP ) shifted choice , producing a dose - related decrease in panel pressing but an increase in pellet intake . In contrast , reinforcer devaluation by pre - feeding substantially decreased both panel pressing and pellet intake . In free - feeding choice tests , mice strongly preferred the milkshake vs . the pellets , and TBZ had no effect on milkshake intake or preference , indicating that the TBZ - induced low - effort bias was not due to changes in primary food motivation or preference . TBZ significantly decreased tissue levels of nucleus accumbens DA . Conclusion The DA depleting agent TBZ induced an effort - related motivational dysfunction in mice , which may have clinical relevance for assessing novel drug targets for their potential use as therapeutic agents in patients with motivation impairments . Keywords Motivation . Dopamine . Schizophrenia . Bussey - Saksida chambers . Panel pressing . Preference test Introduction Motivated behaviors are directed towards or away from par - ticular stimuli , but they also are characterized by a high degree of behavioral activation , vigor , speed , and persistence ( Salamone and Correa 2002 , 2012 ) . To overcome obstacles separating them from significant stimuli , organisms frequently make effort - related decisions based upon cost / benefit analy - ses . Motivational deficits such as anergia , psychomotor retar - dation , apathy , fatigue , and low - effort bias are a major group of symptoms commonly seen in major depression , schizo - phrenia , Parkinsonism , and other disorders ( Salamone et al . 2006 , 2016a , b ; Treadway et al . 2012a , b ; Markou et al . 2013 ; Culbreth et al . 2018a , b ; Zou et al . 2019 ) . Moreover , these motivational symptoms are highly resistant to treatment ( Stahl 2002 ; Fava et al . 2014 ) , and in patients with depression , these symptoms are associated with social withdrawal , unem - ployment , and the overall severity of the disorder ( Gullion and Rush 1998 ; Tylee et al . 1999 ; Stahl 2002 ) . Serotonin ( 5 - HT ) transport inhibitors such as fluoxetine have been widely used to treat depression , and are useful for improving mood - related symptoms , anxiety , and agitation . However , studies have in - dicated that 5 - HT uptake inhibitors are relatively ineffective at treating anergia and fatigue , and in fact , these drugs can exac - erbate those symptoms ( Fava et al . 2014 ; Rothschild et al . 2014 ; Cooper et al . 2014 ) . Thus , there is a need to develop animal models that are useful for assessing treatments for these debilitating effort - related motivational symptoms . * John D .

These procedures include effort - related decision - making tasks that allow animals to make choices between high - effort alternatives leading to highly valued rewards vs . low - effort alternatives that lead to a less valued reward ( i . e . , less preferred or lower in magnitude ) . Tests of effort - based decision making using either operant choice tasks or T - maze barrier procedures have been used to investigate the neural circuitry of effort - related motivational functions . Considerable evidence indicates that effort - based choice is regulated by a distributed neural circuitry involving nucleus accumbens dopamine ( DA ) , and related cortical and limbic areas ( Salamone et al . 1991 , 2007 , 2018a , b ; Walton et al . 2003 ; Floresco and Ghods - Sharifi 2007 ; Floresco et al . 2008 ; Hauber and Sommer 2009 ; Münster and Hauber 2018 ; Münster et al . 2020 ) . Interference with mesolimbic DA transmission by local DA antagonism or depletion results in a low effort - bias characterized by a shift from the high - effort to the low - effort choice ( Salamone et al . 1991 , 1994 ; Cousins et al . 1993 , 1996 ; Farrar et al . 2010 ; Mai et al . 2012 ; Nunes et al . 2013 ) . Additionally , a number of conditions as - sociated with depression in humans , such as stress ( Bryce and Floresco 2016 ) , or pharmacological manipulations ( Nunes et al . 2013 ; Randall et al . 2014 ; Yohn et al . 2015a , b ) , can alter effort - related choice in rats , and bias animals towards low - effort options . For example , rats treated with tetrabenazine ( TBZ ) show alterations in effort - related choice , with reduced selection of the high effort alternative ( Nunes et al . 2013 ; Randall et al . 2014 ; Yohn et al . 2015a , b , 2016a ; b ; c , d ) . TBZ is a vesicular monoamine transport type - 2 ( VMAT - 2 ) inhibitor that blocks striatal DA storage and de - pletes DA ( Pettibone et al . 1984 ; Tanra et al . 1995 ; Wimalasena 2011 ; Nunes et al . 2013 ) . TBZ is used to treat Huntington ’ s disease , but studies report that TBZ induces side effects such as fatigue , apathy , and depressive symptoms ( Frank 2009 , 2010 ; Guay 2010 ; Chen et al . 2012 ; Petersén and Weydt 2019 ) . These findings of a low effort bias induced by TBZ in rats are important because they can serve as the basis for a useful animal model for assessing effort - related motivational deficits . While the neural mechanisms underlying effort - related choice performance have been widely studied in rats several years , there is now an emerging literature focusing on effort - based decision making in mice ( Cagniard et al . 2006 ; Pardo et al . 2012 ; Trifilieff et al . 2013 ; Robles and Johnson 2017 ; Filla et al . 2018 ; Bailey et al . 2020 ; Yang et al . 2020 ; Correa et al . 2020 ) . Correa et al . ( 2018 ) reported that TBZ shifted effort - based choice in mice tested a T - maze barrier task . Furthermore , TBZ reduced selection of voluntary running wheel activity but increased sucrose intake in mice responding on a maze choice task ( López - Cruz et al . 2018 ; Carratalá - Ros et al . 2020 ) . The development of effort - related choice proce - dures in mice is necessary in order to provide generalizations across species , and also because of the potential value of research using genetically altered mice . Recently , Yang et al . ( 2020 ) showed that injections of the DA D2 receptor antago - nist haloperidol shifted effort - based choice in mice tested in Bussey - Saksida touchscreen chambers . The present experi - ments focused on a mouse model of effort - based choice in which the mice were tested in touchscreen operant chambers ( Heath et al . 2015 ) and evaluated for the effort - related effects of TBZ . Experiments also assessed the effects of TBZ on food intake in free - feeding preference tests , and the effects of gen - eral reinforcer devaluation by removal of food restriction . Materials and methods Animals Twenty - four C57BL / 6 male mice ( Charles River ) were used in the present experiments . They were housed in groups of 1 to 4 per home cage in a vivarium with a 12 - h light / dark cycle ( lights on at 07 : 00 ) . Mice weighed 18 - 22 g at the beginning of the study ( 4 – 5 weeks old ) , and were food restricted to 85 % of their free - feeding body weight for initial operant training , after which modest growth was allowed throughout the experi - ment . Mice were fed supplemental chow ( Laboratory Diet , 5P00 Prolab RMH 3000 , Purina Mills ) daily to maintain weight , and water was available ad libitum in their home cages . All the behavioral sessions and drug testing were con - sistently conducted during the light part of the light / dark cycle on weekdays , and the same 24 animals were used for all phases of the experiments . All animal protocols were ap - proved by the University of Connecticut Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee , and followed NIH guidelines . Pharmacological agents Tetrabenazine ( TBZ , 9 , 10 - dimethoxy - 3 - ( 2 - methylpropyl ) - 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 , 11b - hexahydrobenzo [ a ] quinolizin - 2 - one ) was purchased from Tocris Bioscience ( Ellisville , MO , USA ) . TBZ , a VMAT - 2 inhibitor that blocks DA storage , was ini - tially dissolved in a solution that consisted of 20 % dimethylsulfoxide ( DMSO ) and 80 % saline , which served as the vehicle control solution . In order to get the drug complete - ly dissolved into solution , the pH value was adjusted to 4 . 0 by adding small amounts of a 1 . 0 N hydrogen chloride solution . Dose selection ( 2 . 0 , 4 . 0 , 6 . 0 , 8 . 0 mg / kg ) was based on pilot research and previously published studies ( Yohn et al . 2016a , d ; Yun et al . 2017 ; Correa et al . 2018 ; SanMiguel et al . 2018 ) . All injections were administered intraperitoneally ( IP ) , and the Psychopharmacology lead time was 120 min for TBZ and its vehicle . The injection volume for each mouse was 0 . 1 ml / 10 g . Apparatus and materials Behavioral sessions were conducted in Bussey - Saksida touchscreen chambers ( Campden Instruments Led , Loughborough , UK ) , each consisting of a touchscreen ( 30 . 7 cm , resolution 800 × 600 ) , a feeder , and an operant arena . The operant arena was enclosed by trapezoidal walls and a touchscreen on one side , situated directly across from the feeder . The reinforcer for panel pressing was a strawberry nutrition shake ( Ensure Plus , Abbott Nutrition , Columbus , OH ) , which was delivered to the feeder magazine by the liquid diet dispenser . Food preference tests were conducted in empty home cages , and modified pipette tips ( 5 . 0 ml , Gilson ) were used to deliver the milkshake , which the mice could obtain by licking the nozzle . Behavioral procedures Behavioral sessions ( 30 - min sessions , 5 days / week ) were con - ducted in Bussey - Saksida touchscreen chambers . Each com - pleted response ( i . e . , a panel press ) was reinforced with straw - berry nutrition shake . The initial training procedure was con - ducted as described in a previous study ( for details , see Yang et al . 2020 ) . In brief , mice were individually exposed to 1 - ml strawberry shake in their home cages for 2 days , and then were subjected to 30 - min initial magazine training sessions for 3 days , during which the feeder delivered 20 μ l of the milkshake automatically every 30 s , or 60 μ l if one response to a white square panel ( 4 . 57 × 4 . 57 cm , 1 . 52 cm from the floor ) on a black background screen was made . Followed by the initial magazine training , mice were trained to press the panel on a continuous reinforcement schedule ( i . e . , fixed ratio 1 ; FR1 ) for 2 weeks . After which , the panel was raised to the center of the touchscreen ( 6 . 1 cm from the floor ) so that the mice had to rear up to respond . After 4 weeks of training on FR1 with the raised panel , the mice were exposed to a dish of fifteen high carbohydrate pellets ( 45 mg , Bio - Serv , Frenchtown , NJ ) for 2 days in their home cages and were then subjected to the con - current FR1 / choice procedure . With this task , animals had concurrent access to either the FR1 schedule reinforced by the milkshake , or a dish of weighed pellets that was also pres - ent in each chamber . At the end of the sessions , mice were removed immediately from the chambers , and pellet intake was determined by weighing the remaining pellets , including spillage . All experiments used a within - subject design for drug treatment , in which each mouse received all doses of drug and vehicle treatments in a randomly varied order , one treatment per week . Experiment 1 : effects of TBZ on the concurrent FR1 / choice task Mice ( n = 24 ) were trained on FR1 / choice task up to 4 weeks , and they received one habituation injection ( 0 . 1 ml saline ) 1 week before the drug testing phase . On drug test days , all mice received vehicle and following doses of TBZ ; 2 . 0 , 4 . 0 , 6 . 0 , and 8 . 0 mg / kg , in a randomly varied order . Mice received one drug treatment per week , and there was a 4 - day baseline train - ing before the next drug test day . All injections were given 120 min before testing started . Experiment 2 : effects of reinforcer devaluation by pre - feeding on the concurrent FR1 / choice task Following one additional training week on FR1 / choice task , all mice were taken off food - restriction and were pre - fed 24 h prior to the testing session . Baseline was acquired from the last day of the training days . Panel pressing and pellet intake were measured on the pre - fed day and were compared with baseline day while animals were food - restricted . Experiment 3 : effects of TBZ on reinforcer intake and preference Food preference test was conducted in empty home cages to determine the reinforcer preference of milkshake and pellet used in the effort - related touchscreen task . Each mouse was put back on food restriction and was trained to access the milkshake by licking the nozzle of a modified pipette tip for 2 weeks . After which , they were exposed to a dish of pellets in the same environment for another week . Subsequently , each mouse was allowed to approach and consume concurrent milkshake and pellets freely in 30 - min sessions for 2 weeks . On drug testing days , all mice received vehicle and following doses of TBZ ; 2 . 0 , 4 . 0 , 6 . 0 , and 8 . 0 mg / kg , in a randomly varied order , one treatment per week . Experiment 4 : effect of TBZ on DA tissue levels in nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum In order to determine the effects of systemic administration of TBZ on striatal DA levels , tissue assay and HPLC analysis were conducted as previously reported ( Nunes et al . 2013 ; López - Cruz et al . 2018 ) . After the series of experiments were completed , the most effective TBZ dose ( 8 . 0 mg / kg , based on experiment 1 ) was administered to half group of the mice and vehicle to the other half . One hundred and twenty minutes after TBZ administration , mice were deeply anesthetized with carbon dioxide , and their brain samples were quickly extract - ed . Brain tissues were frozen and sliced on a microtome ( Bright Instrument , Luton , UK ) , and were cut coronally from anterior . Tissue samples were collected from coronal section Psychopharmacology ( 750 μ m thick ) at + 1 . 54 mm anterior to bregma based on Franklin and Paxinos ’ mouse atlas . A 16 - gauge stainless - steel tube was used to punch bilateral cylindrical samples from the nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum ( Fig . 4 upper ) . These samples were placed in 200 μ l of ascorbic acid solution ( made with 10 mg ascorbic acid and 100 mg sodium metabisulfate in 10 ml HPLC grade water ) , and then homogenized , centri - fuged , and frozen . Subsequently , DA levels were analyzed by using HPLC with the electrochemical detection software ( ESA Coulochem II system ) , using methods that have been published previously for both microdialysis and tissue assay studies ( detection into the low picogram range ; Nunes et al . 2013 ; López - Cruz et al . 2018 ) . The electrochemical parame - ters were as follows : channel 1 = + 100 mV , channel 2 = + 200 mV , and guard cell = + 350 mV . Each liter of mobile phase solution contained 27 . 6 g sodium phosphate monobasic , 7 . 0 % of methanol , 750 μ l of 0 . 1 M ethylene diamine tetra - acetic acid , and 1 , 425 μ l of 0 . 4 M sodium octyl sulfate dissolved in deionized ultrapure H 2 O with a final pH of 4 . 5 . The flow rate for the HPLC was set at 0 . 5 ml / min . DA standard solution ( 10 - 7 M , Sigma - Aldrich Chemical , St Louis , MO ) was used as a baseline sample in order to quantify the DA levels ( ng / mg ) in tissue samples . Statistical analyses The main dependent variables of interest for experiment 1 and 2 were total number of panel presses and gram quantity of pellet intake during 30 - min sessions . In experiment 3 , rein - forcer consumption quantities in grams ( pellets ) and in milli - liters ( milkshake ) were measured , and then were transformed into kilo - calories for comparison purposes . Data were ana - lyzed with repeated measures of analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) designs using a statistical program ( SPSS 23 . 0 for Windows ) . To determine the differences between treat - ments , non - orthogonal planned comparisons were used if the overall ANOVA was significant , following procedures de - scribed in Keppel ( 1991 ) . Overall error term was used , and the number of comparisons was restricted to the number of treatments minus 1 . Additionally , t tests were used to deter - mine the treatment difference for experiments 2 and 4 , in which two conditions were assessed . All data were presented as mean ± SEM , and significance level was set at α = 0 . 05 . All figures were created by the use of SigmaPlot 10 . 0 . Results Experiment 1 : effects of TBZ on the concurrent FR1 / choice task Figure 1 shows the effects of systemic administration of TBZ on performance of the FR1 / choice task . Repeated measures ANOVA revealed that TBZ significantly decreased panel presses [ F ( 4 , 92 ) = 20 . 165 , p < 0 . 001 ] and increased pellet intake [ F ( 4 , 92 ) = 3 . 205 , p < 0 . 05 ) ] . Planned comparisons showed that the panel presses were significantly lower at TBZ 6 . 0 and 8 . 0 mg / kg treatments compared with vehicle condition ( both p < 0 . 001 ) , and the pellet intake was significantly higher at TBZ 6 . 0 and 8 . 0 mg / kg compared with vehicle ( p < 0 . 05 at 6 . 0 mg / kg and p < 0 . 01 at 8 . 0 mg / kg ) . Based on the results , 8 . 0 mg / kg was therefore chosen as the most effective dose for the subsequent tissue assay analysis in experiment 4 . Experiment 2 : effects of reinforcer devaluation by pre - feeding on the concurrent FR1 / choice task Figure 2 shows the effects of 24 h pre - feeding on performance of the FR1 / choice task . The paired - sample t test indicated that the effects of pre - feeding significantly suppressed both panel press - ing [ t ( 23 ) = 13 . 141 , p < 0 . 001 ] and pellet intake [ t ( 23 ) = 8 . 625 , p < 0 . 001 ] , indicating the difference in effects between the rein - forcer devaluation and TBZ administration in experiment 1 . Experiment 3 : effects of TBZ on reinforcer intake and preference Systemic administration of TBZ had no effect on the prefer - ence between liquid diet milkshake and high carbohydrate pellet ( Fig . 3 ) . Both types of food consumption were recalculated as kilo - calories for comparison purposes , so that they could be represented on the same scale . Factorial ANOVA indicated a significant difference for consumption of the two foods , with mice strongly preferring the milkshake over the pellets ( Fig . 3 , F ( 1 , 22 ) = 597 . 678 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Moreover , there was no significant effect of TBZ treatment ( p = 0 . 158 ) and no treatment x food type interaction ( p = 0 . 914 ) , demonstrating that TBZ had no effects on food intake and preference between the two reinforcers in free - feeding tests . Experiment 4 : effect of TBZ on DA tissue levels in nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum Figure 4 shows the effects of 8 . 0 mg / kg TBZ on striatal DA levels . Results of the t test analyses showed that DA levels were significantly lower in mice treated TBZ compared with those treated with vehicle in nucleus accumbens ( t ( 20 ) = 5 . 951 , p < 0 . 001 ) and dorsal striatum ( t ( 20 ) = 6 . 449 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Discussion These experiments assessed the effort - related motivational ef - fects of the VMAT inhibitor TBZ , which is a reversible and selective inhibitor of VMAT - 2 that has a 10 , 000 - fold higher Psychopharmacology binding affinity for VMAT - 2 relative to VMAT - 1 ( Jankovic and Clarence - Smith 2011 ; Chen et al . 2012 ) . Mice were trained in the touchscreen FR1 / choice paradigm , which re - cently has been shown to be sensitive to the effects of the DA D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol . In this previous re - search , the effects of haloperidol on the touchscreen task were not due to changes in food intake or preference , and did not resemble the effects of reinforcer devaluation by removal of food restriction ( Yang et al . 2020 ) . Similar to the effects of DA antagonism , experiment 1 demonstrated that mice treated with the DA depleting agent TBZ showed a shift of preference from panel pressing to intake of the concurrently available food pellets . These results suggest that TBZ induced a low effort bias in mice assessed on this task . In a food preference test ( experiment 2 ) , the same doses of TBZ had no effect on food intake or preference between milkshake and pellets . These results indicate that the TBZ - induced low effort bias was not due to changes of primary food motivation , food preference , or consumption . Moreover , the effects of TBZ in the first experiment did not resemble the effects of general reinforcer devaluation by removal from food restriction ( ex - periment 3 ; home cage feeding on laboratory chow ) , because reinforcer devaluation substantially reduced both lever pressing and chow intake . These results in mice are highly consistent with previous rat studies demonstrating that TBZ reduced selection of the high effort / high reward option on a T - maze barrier choice task , a concurrent FR5 / chow - feeding choice , and a concurrent progressive ratio / chow - feeding choice procedure ( Salamone et al . 2012 ; Nunes et al . 2013 ; Yohn et al . 2015b , 2016a ) . Furthermore , mice that received 8 . 0 mg / kg TBZ had significantly lower accumbens and neostriatal DA levels compared with those given vehicle as measured by HPLC analysis of tissue samples ( experiment 4 ) . These neurochemical findings are consistent with previous work showing that TBZ altered expression of phosphorylated DARPP - 32 in mice and rats in a manner consistent with a reduction of accumbens D1 and D1 receptor signaling ( Nunes et al . 2013 ; López - Cruz et al . 2018 ) , reduced tissue levels of DA in mice ( López - Cruz et al . 2018 ) , and lowered extracellular levels of accumbens DA in rats as measured by microdialysis ( Nunes et al . 2013 ) . In view of clinical data showing that TBZ can induce depressive symptoms , apathy , and fatigue in humans ( Frank 2009 ; Guay 2010 ; Chen et al . 2012 ) , the present experiments suggest that studies of the effort - related effects of TBZ could provide a useful preclinical TBZ Dose ( mg / kg ) Veh 2 4 6 8 ) n i m 03 ( sesse r P l e n a P 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 * * a TBZ Dose ( mg / kg ) Veh 2 4 6 8 ) g ( eka t n I t e ll e P 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 * * b Fig . 1 Effects of TBZ on touchscreen choice performance in C57BL6 mice . a Mean ( ± SEM ) number of panel presses after treatment with vehicle and various doses of TBZ ( n = 24 ) . b Mean ( ± SEM ) intake of concurrently available food pellets ( in grams ) after treatment with vehicle and various doses of TBZ . * p < 0 . 05 , different from vehicle , planned comparison TBZ Dose ( mg / kg ) Veh 2 4 6 8 ) l a C k ( n o i t p m u s no C dooF 0 1 2 3 4 5 MilkshakePellet Fig . 3 Effects ofTBZ on intake of strawberry Ensure milkshakeand food pellets in the free feeding preference tests . Mean ( ± SEM ) intake ( in kCal ) for both types of foods is shown . Mice treated with TBZ strongly preferred milkshake over pellets ( F ( 1 , 22 ) = 597 . 678 , p < 0 . 001 ) , and there were no significant effects of TBZ on intake of either food .

Unlike TBZ , pre - feeding decreased both panel pressing and pellet intake ( n = 24 ) . * p < 0 . 05 , different from baseline Psychopharmacology animal model . For example , this model may be useful for assessing the ability of potential drug treatment to reverse motivational dysfunctions in humans . Although one could suggest that the suppressive effects of TBZ on panel pressing in mice are due to primary motivation - al deficits that underlie the unconditioned effects of food re - inforcement , this interpretation seems extremely unlikely be - cause mice treated with same doses of TBZ did not show reduced food intake and still strongly preferred the milkshake over pellets in food preference test ( Fig . 3 ) . Furthermore , the pattern of TBZ effects was not mimicked by reinforcer deval - uation that was induced by removing the animals from food restriction 24 h before the operant session started ( Fig . 2 ) . These effects of reduced food motivation are highly consistent with rat studies showing that reinforcer devaluation or admin - istration of appetite suppressant drugs produces effects on effort - based choice that are different than those induced by DA antagonists , neurotoxic depletions of accumbens DA , or TBZ ( Salamone et al . 1991 , 2002 ; Sink et al . 2008 ; Randall et al . 2012 , 2014 ) . Furthermore , recent studies in mice dem - onstrated that DA antagonism and modulation of striatal DA D2 receptor signaling predominantly affected effort - based de - cision making rather than value - based decision making ( Filla et al . 2018 ; Bailey et al . 2020 ) . Taken together , these data indicate that the effects of TBZ on effort - based choice in ro - dents are not due to alterations in food preference or consump - tion , and are not caused by a fundamental disruption of the primary motivational or unconditioned reinforcing effects of food . Because of its ability to inhibit VMAT - 2 , TBZ at higher doses could ultimately affect the storage of all monoamines , although studies indicate that the greatest effects of TBZ at low doses are on accumbens and striatal DA . A study focusing on administration of clinical doses of TBZ to humans reported that the only statistically significant monoamine depletions in postmortem tissue were DA in the caudate , norepinephrine in the amygdala , and norepinephrine and DA in the hippocam - pus ( Guay 2010 ) . Pettibone et al . ( 1984 ) showed that 1 . 0 mg / kg tetrabenazine reduced striatal DA in rats by about 75 % , but only reduced 5 - HT and norepinephrine by about 15 – 30 % . They also observed that a dose of 10 . 0 mg / kg TBZ was needed to reduce 5 - HT levels as much as 1 . 0 mg / kg depleted striatal DA . Tanra et al . ( 1995 ) reported that 1 . 0 mg / kg TBZ reduced striatal DA in rats by 57 % , whereas there was only a 20 % reduction of 5 - HT in hypothalamus , and there were no significant reductions of 5 - HT in frontal cortex , stri - atum , or hippocampus . Nunes et al . ( 2013 ) found that 0 . 75 mg / kg TBZ reduced extracellular DA in nucleus accumbens core of rats by approximately 75 % as measured by in vivo microdialysis . Unlike reserpine , TBZ is a reversible inhibitor of VMAT - 2 , and in the Nunes et al . ( 2013 ) study , the effects of TBZ on extracellular DA were transient , peaking 2 – 2 . 5 h after administration . Although the exact time course of the effects of TBZ in mice are not known , these findings from rat studies are consistent with the results of experiment 4 , showing that the behaviorally active dose of 8 . 0 mg / kg TBZ in mice resulted in a greater than 55 % reduction in tissue levels of DA in nucleus accumbens and neostriatum . Together with the present results , these studies support the hypothesis that the effects of TBZ on effort - related choice in mice are largely due to actions on DA . Although the present studies cannot differentiate between the role of nucleus ac - cumbens vs . neostriatal DA , previous studies involving neu - rotoxic depletions of DA with 6 - OHDA or injections of TBZ reported that the shift from lever pressing to chow intake in rats tested on a concurrent FR5 / chow feeding task was due to DA depletions in the accumbens , and not dorsomedial or ven - trolateral neostriatum ( Cousins et al . 1993 ; Nunes et al . 2013 ) . Considering the effects of striatal DA depletion induced by TBZ , it is important to determine whether or not the suppres - sion of panel pressing was due to disruption of motor - related Fig . 4 Effect of 8 . 0 mg / kg TBZ on striatal DA levels . Upper : diagram of coronal sections with bregma coordinates showing location of the brain area for tissue assays ( red circle : nucleus accumbens ) and ( blue circle : caudate putamen ( dorsal striatum ) ) . The atlas section is adapted from Franklin and Paxinos . Lower : administration of 8 . 0 mg / kg TBZ sup - pressed DA levels in a nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) and b dorsal striatum ( DS ) . Data are expressed as mean ( ± SEM ) of ng per mg of DA in tissue . * p < 0 . 05 significantly different from vehicle Psychopharmacology function . We did not assess behavioral measures such as mag - azine latencies and post - reinforcement pauses or horizontal locomotor activity , which would be useful measures to obtain in future research . Nevertheless , none of the TBZ doses used in the preference test suppressed drinking of the liquid diet or eating the hard food pellets , which are motoric responses that involve postural control , head movements , orofacial , and fore - limb motor functions , yet despite the fact that some aspects of motor function were not impaired by TBZ , it can still be ar - gued that if subtle motor dysfunctions contributed to the TBZ - induced suppression of panel pressing . For example , one study indicates that 8 . 0 mg / kg TBZ could produce a slight suppression of rearing in C57BL6 mice exposed to a novel environment ( San Miguel et al . , unpublished data ) . This not - withstanding , it should be emphasized that novelty - induced locomotion , rearing , magazine latencies , and pauses are not simply motor responses occurring in isolation , but they also involve responsiveness to motivational conditions . Thus , reporting that TBZ makes mice slightly slower or less active does not necessarily mean that motivational functions are not being affected , because response vigor and speed are funda - mental features of activational aspects of motivation ( Salamone and Correa 2002 ; Salamone et al . 2016a , b , Salamone et al . 2018a , b ) . It is clear from the behavioral sci - ence literature that there is considerable overlap between as - pects of motor and motivational function , and these effort - related processes involving exertion of effort that are mediated by DA are clearly at the intersection of these two constructs ( Salamone and Correa 2002 , 2012 ; Salamone et al . 2017 , 2018a , b ; Yang et al . 2020 ) . The interwoven nature of motor and motivational function is also evident in psychopathology , as depressed people show psychomotor slowing , reduced se - lection of high - effort finger tapping , and reductions in loco - motion ( Todder et al . 2009 ; Treadway et al . 2012b ) . In fact , it is difficult to argue that exertion of physical effort and self - reported energy is a not fundamental aspect of activational aspects of motivation that are important clinically in terms of symptoms such as fatigue and anergia . Although the present results are broadly consistent with previous studies focusing on the effects of TBZ in rats , there also appear to be differences . TBZ appears to be much less potent in mice ( effects at 6 . 0 – 8 . 0 mg / kg IP ; see also Carratalá - Ros et al . 2020 ) than in rats tested across a broad range of effort - related choice tests ( 0 . 5 – 1 . 0 mg / kg IP ; Nunes et al . 2013 ; Randall et al . 2014 ; Yohn et al . 2015a , b ) . Moreover , the degree of suppression of lever pressing in rats tested on the FR5 / chow feeding choice task after TBZ administration ( > 90 % reduction ; Nunes et al . 2013 ) was much greater than the extent of the reductions in panel pressing seen in the pres - ent study ( approximately 50 % ) , which may have to do with task differences as well as species differences . Nevertheless , together with the Yang et al . ( 2020 ) study , the present research indicates that effort - based choice tasks using mouse touchscreen chambers can provide reliable procedures for assessing drug effects . With the FR1 panel pressing schedule being used , the variability between animals was relatively low , although other variants of these tasks ( e . g . , progressive ratio panel pressing , higher FR schedules ) may yield broader individual differences that are similar to those seen in rat pro - gressive ratio / chow feeding tasks ( e . g . , Randall et al . 2012 , 2014 ) or effort - related tasks involving cognitive effort ( Cocker et al . 2012 ) . In summary , a novel effort - related touchscreen para - digm in mice has provided findings that highlight the ef - fects of TBZ on instrumental response choice . TBZ deplet - ed DA in nucleus accumbens and neostriatum , and induced a dose - dependent shift in effort - based choice . This VMAT - 2 inhibitor decreased panel pressing for a preferred food ( milkshake ) but increased intake of a less preferred food source , which in behavioral economic terms served as a less costly substitute ( i . e . food pellets ) . TBZ did not pro - duce effects that resembled the effects of reinforcer deval - uation by removal of food restriction , nor did it alter the intake or preference for the two foods . These results dem - onstrate that TBZ did not shift choice behavior from panel pressing to pellet intake because of a decrease in appetite or preference for the milkshake reinforcement , but rather because of reduced bias towards the instrumental behavior of panel pressing . TBZ - treated mice tested in the touchscreen choice task were still directed towards the ac - quisition and consumption of food , but they reallocated their normal pattern of food seeking by increasing pellet intake . This work has clinical implications because the re - duced bias towards physical effort in TBZ - treated mice ( see also López - Cruz et al . 2018 ; Carratalá - Ros et al . 2020 ; Correa et al . 2020 ) can potentially serve as a useful animal model for the assessment of possible treatments for motivational symptoms . For example , future research should determine if the effects of TBZ in mice engaged in touchscreen performance can be reversed by drugs such as DA transport inhibitors ( Nunes et al . 2013 ; Randall et al . 2014 ; Yohn et al . 2015a , b ; Rotolo et al . 2019 ) and aden - osine A 2A receptor antagonists ( Pardo et al . 2012 ; Nunes et al . 2013 ; Yohn et al . 2015b ; López - Cruz et al . 2014 ) . Furthermore , this touchscreen paradigm is a useful plat - form for assessing motivated behavior in genetically al - tered mouse models such as humanized COMT mice ( Yang et al . submitted ) or mice with altered expression of VMAT - 2 levels ( Lohr et al . 2016 ) . Along with other rodent tasks , mouse touchscreen procedures involving effort - based choice may ultimately contribute to developing a greater understanding of the neural mechanisms underly - ing motivational function and dysfunction , and may aid in the development of therapeutic treatments for motivational deficits seen in patients with schizophrenia , depression , and other psychiatric disorders .
