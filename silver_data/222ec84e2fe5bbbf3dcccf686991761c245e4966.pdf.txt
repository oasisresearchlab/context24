To examine how social contacts formed in different activity settings influences 22 interventions required to control outbreaks , we combined high - resolution data on contacts 23 among passengers and crew on cruise ships with network transmission models . We found 24 passengers had a median of 20 ( IQR 10 – 36 ) unique close contacts per day , and over 60 % of 25 their contact episodes were made in dining or sports areas where mask wearing is typically 26 limited . In simulated outbreaks , we found that vaccination coverage and rapid antigen tests had 27 a larger effect than mask mandates alone , indicating the importance of combined interventions 28 against Delta to reduce event risk in the vaccine era . 29 30 Main Text : 31 32 Many countries are resuming domestic activities as vaccination coverage and population 33 immunity against SARS - CoV - 2 increases ( 1 – 3 ) . Settings with particularly high contact rates , 34 such as meetings , conferences , exhibitions , and cruises , are also revenue generating sectors 35 with high pre - pandemic visitor throughput across the world ( 4 , 5 ) . However , the transmission 36 dynamics on real world networks of large - scale events are yet to be fully explored in the COVID - 37 19 era ( 6 ) . Understanding the risk of outbreaks in these settings and possible outbreak control 38 interventions would enable event planners to gauge the sustainability of their operations and for 39 policy makers to weigh the public health cost against the economic gains . Given breakthrough 40 infections in vaccinated individuals and the spread of the highly transmissible SARS - CoV - 2 41 Delta variant ( 7 – 9 ) , countries have employed a range of tools alongside routine vaccination to 42 suppress disease transmission , including vaccine certifications , rapid antigen tests , mask 43 .

Although there have been efforts to 1 estimate infection risk during large events from routine testing data and contact tracing 2 interviews ( 12 ) , data from contact tracing devices can enable finer scale assessment of 3 interactions such as the distance and duration of contact depending on the strength and 4 continuity of the Bluetooth signals captured in these devices . Furthermore , these devices 5 overcome the challenges of recall bias and achieve more reliable estimates of the contacts in a 6 network ( 13 ) . 7 8 In Singapore , ‘cruises to nowhere’ ( i . e . cruises that depart and return to the port of origin without 9 other ports of call ) began as a safe travelling option during the COVID - 19 pandemic with a 10 range of activities and hence setting - specific interactions onboard . We collected contact data 11 from around 1 , 000 crew and 1 , 300 passengers per sailing between November 2020 and 12 February 2021 and analysed the resulting social interaction networks . We then use these 13 contact networks to simulate SARS - CoV - 2 Delta variant outbreaks and assess how different 14 combinations of interventions and network formulations influence transmission in a range of 15 settings during a large - scale event . 16 17 Results 18 Characterising social interactions on cruise ships 19 3 , 963 , 256 contact episodes with 1 , 846 , 312 unique contact pairs were recorded during 37 - hour 20 data collection periods across four separate three - day sailings ( see Materials and methods ) . 21 During the period studied , cruise lines were operating at 50 % capacity with a passenger to crew 22 ratio of approximately 1 : 1 and passengers from different travelling groups were strongly advised 23 to maintain a physical distance of at least one metre from other groups . 24 25 The four sailings had a mean of 1304 passengers ( range 1142 – 1682 ) with a median age of 54 26 ( IQR 35 – 63 ) and a mean of 1050 crew ( range 1003 – 1083 ) spread across eight work 27 departments ( Table 1 ) . There was a high density of contacts among passengers , with some 28 clustering of contacts among crew , although crew members may be required to work with other 29 individuals from the same or different departments , and roles such as housekeeping and galley 30 crew had contacts dispersed across the network ( Fig . 1A and fig . S1 ) . Crew were encouraged to 31 form ‘work bubbles’ as part of COVID - 19 workplace interventions ( i . e . team of workers that work 32 independently from another team ) . As a result , on average they had 10 unique close contacts 33 per day ( IQR 6 – 18 ) , about 50 % lower than that of passengers ( median 20 , IQR 10 – 36 ) ( Fig . 34 1B ) . If the threshold for close contact ( defined as a cumulative duration of interaction of 15 35 minutes in our baseline analysis ) was relaxed to a shorter duration , the overall median unique 36 close contacts scaled exponentially ( Fig . 1C ) . The strength of each contact ( i . e . edge weights ) 37 can be further quantified as a function of the duration of the contact ( see Materials and 38 methods ) . Adjusted for the duration of each contact , the median weighted degree in crew was 39 8 . 3 ( IQR 4 . 4 – 13 . 5 ) , while the median in passengers was 13 . 9 ( IQR 5 . 6 – 23 . 7 ) ( Table 2 ) . 40 Furthermore , passengers had significantly higher connectivity with other highly - connected 41 individuals , with a median eigenvector centrality of 0 . 3 ( IQR 0 . 1 – 0 . 5 ) compared to a median of 42 0 . 09 ( IQR 0 . 03 – 0 . 2 ) for crew ( Table 2 and fig . S2 ) . 43 44 45 Table 1 Demographics of passengers ( A ) and crew ( B ) onboard four cruise sailings .

Passengers are largely 5 mask - off when dining or engaged in sports and this accounted for 79 % ( IQR 69 – 84 % ) of all 6 close contact episodes , 69 % ( IQR 57 – 76 % ) causal and 60 % ( IQR 51 – 66 % ) transient contact 7 episodes ( Fig . 3A ) . 8 9 Fig . 3 Type of contact by location of interaction and throughout the sailing , ( A ) proportion of all 10 close , casual and transient contact episodes between passengers of different travelling groups 11 by the location of interaction , ( B ) proportion of all close , casual and transient contact episodes 12 between passengers of different travelling groups by respective F & B locations . 13 14 Modelling outbreak dynamics and interventions 15 16 To examine the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 on cruise ships and implications for other large - scale 17 multi - day events , we used the contact data to generate an undirected network with nodes and 18 edges representing individuals and the contact between them respectively . We defined the 19 strength of an edge as a function of the proportion of days with recorded contact over a three - 20 day sail period and the mean daily cumulative contact duration between two individuals to 21 approximate a scenario where the edge weight reached 95 % saturation after 3 hours of contact 22 ( see Materials and methods ) . This meant that the propensity for transmission increased and 23 stabilised after 3 hours of contact , to mimic contacts formed in family gatherings over extended 24 periods of time ( 14 , 15 ) . 25 26 We extended a community network transmission model ( 16 , 17 ) to simulate SAR - CoV - 2 Delta 27 variant transmission over seven days , to enable comparison between different interventions 28 during early generations of transmission . We considered interventions including : ( i ) one - off PCR 29 testing one day before the sailing ( to allow for test turnaround time ) , ( ii ) rapid antigen testing at 30 the start and halfway through the event , ( iii ) mask wearing in feasible settings and ( iv ) 31 .

In both ( i ) and ( ii ) testing interventions , we assumed 1 infected individuals were isolated immediately after a positive test . The sensitivity of the PCR 2 and rapid antigen tests were assumed to vary with viral load modelled according to the Delta 3 variant ( 8 , 18 – 20 ) . For the mask wearing intervention , we assumed that passengers of different 4 travelling groups would be exposed to each other without a mask during dining , sports activities 5 ( e . g . pool and waterslides , rock climbing , basketball , football ) or smoking breaks ; and would be 6 wearing a mask correctly otherwise . Furthermore , contacts between passengers and crew were 7 assumed to occur with mask - on at all times and crew - crew contacts were assumed to occur 8 without a mask during meals times , workouts or smoking breaks . The proportion of contacts that 9 occurred without a mask were modelled based on the proportion of contacts occurring in F & B 10 and sport settings ( Fig . 3A ) . 11 12 Under the baseline scenario with no modelled interventions , with one initial infected individual 13 and assuming that the event lasted for 7 days , we estimated a median of 10 individuals ( IQR 3 – 14 23 ) would be infected by the end of the event ( Fig . 4A and fig . S3A ) . Of these , 90 % ( IQR 84 – 15 100 ) would only develop symptoms after the event . Because presymptomatic transmission was 16 assumed to account for 25 % the transmission , more than two generations of infections could 17 sometimes occur during the event ( Fig . S3B ) . We estimated that 64 % and 17 % of the simulated 18 outbreaks involved spillover from passengers to crew and inter - department crew transmission 19 respectively , and we estimated that spillover events first occurred in the 2nd ( IQR 2 – 3 ) and 3rd 20 ( IQR 3 – 4 ) generation respectively . Outbreaks with a final size of more than 10 cases occurred 21 in 48 % of our simulations ( Fig . 4B ) . 22 23 With the introduction of a one - off PCR test one day prior to the start of the cruise , the index 24 case was isolated in 49 % of the time , while 5 % of the remaining simulations resulted in no 25 transmission due to the stochastic nature of early disease transmission and the structure of the 26 social network ( Fig . 4B ) . As a result , more than half of the simulations had zero secondary 27 cases . The risk of an outbreak of more than 10 cases was reduced to 22 % with the PCR 28 intervention . However , with rapid antigen testing at the start and at halfway through the event 29 instead , only 3 % of simulations resulted in a large outbreak . 30 31 We also modelled passenger - passenger interactions occurring under a mask - off setting 32 approximately 60 % of the time ( based on the total transient , casual and close contacts in Fig . 33 2A ) and assumed that all passenger - crew interactions occurred while wearing masks and that 34 30 % of crew - crew interactions occurred when eating or working out without mask . Under these 35 conditions and in the absence of other interventions , 22 % of the simulations end with a large 36 outbreak size ( Fig . 4B ) . Assuming all individuals onboard the cruise ship were vaccinated 37 ( individuals under 12 years of age account for only 2 % of the cruise population ) , 95 % of 38 simulations resulted in 5 or fewer cases ( Fig . 4B ) . 39 40 We examined the expected outbreak size under a combination of interventions under the 41 assumption that vaccination confers 50 % protection against infection ( 9 , 21 , 22 ) and 50 % 42 lowered infectiousness in a vaccinated but infected individual ( 23 ) ( Fig . 4C and 4D ) . Regardless 43 of the testing strategies applied ( i . e . no test , once - off PCR test , rapid antigen testing at the start 44 and halfway through the event ) , and at any level of vaccine coverage , the addition of a mask - on 45 intervention would further reduce the expected outbreak size by about 54 % ( IQR 50 – 59 % ) . 46 Given outbreak size is the cumulative result of individual transmission events , this implies that 47 the overall intervention effectiveness of a mask mandate is substantially less than the assumed 48 mask - on efficacy at the individual level ( Table 4 ) ( 24 – 26 ) . The expected outbreak size in 49 simulations involving rapid antigen testing was less than 1 when vaccine coverage was 50 minimally 25 % ( i . e . the expected number of transmission events was less than the initial number 51 .

The expected outbreak size in mask - on , no testing 1 interventions differed from mask - off , once - off PCR testing intervention by less than 1 case 2 across varying vaccination coverage . The same was observed between a mask - on , once off 3 PCR testing intervention and a mask - off , rapid antigen testing intervention . Compared to the 4 expected outbreak size , the 95 th percentile of the outbreak size is approximately 3 times higher , 5 with the no testing , mask - off and one - off PCR testing , mask - off interventions generating the 6 highest number of cases among all other combinations of interventions ( Fig . 4D ) . 7 8 Sensitivity analysis under different assumptions of the edge weights – and hence per - contact 9 risk – showed an increase in the expected outbreak size as the duration required to be defined 10 as a ‘maximal contact’ ( i . e . weight of one ) decreases ( Fig . S4 ) . Across all scenarios of varying 11 testing strategy , vaccination coverage , network assumptions for edge weight , the average 12 reduction in the expected outbreak size between a mask - on and mask - off scenario was 60 % 13 ( IQR 54 – 71 % ) . . Assuming edge weights vary based on the proportion of days over the entire 14 sailing when interactions were recorded ( i . e . a transient contact in a day is as risky as a close 15 contact in a day ) , the difference in the expected outbreak size between a mask - on , no testing 16 scenario and a mask - off , once - off PCR testing widens to 32 cases ( IQR 11 – 64 ) ( Fig . S4C ) . The 17 difference in the expected outbreak size between a mask - on , once - off PCR testing scenario and 18 a mask - off , rapid antigen testing at the start and halfway through the event differed by 6 cases 19 ( IQR 5 – 19 ) ( Fig . S4C ) . We obtained similar conclusions on the relative effect of different 20 combinations of interventions when we varied assumptions about the extent of vaccine 21 effectiveness and presymptomatic transmission ( see Supplementary Materials ) . 22 23 .

The presence of multi - group 11 passengers and crew from different departments can therefore offers insights into the potential 12 dynamics of different actors in other large - scale multi - day events ( e . g . a conference where there 13 are participants , organising teams , external vendors , front - end and back - end F & B service staff , 14 audio visual support teams ) and resulting implications for control of SARS - CoV - 2 . 15 16 Our social network analysis showed that passengers had a high number of contacts and their 17 contacts typically exhibit high levels of contact with other individuals . As such , any disease 18 transmission would likely be driven by passenger level interactions rather than crew . In early 19 2020 , this was evident in the sharp rise in the number of COVID - 19 passengers with symptom 20 onset before or during the early stages of quarantine onboard the Diamond Princess ( 27 ) . While 21 the number of contacts made with other passengers are potentially lowered due to physical 22 distancing and awareness of the pandemic in the studied Singapore setting , the number and 23 type of activities onboard the cruise still means that each passenger forms around 20 unique 24 close contacts per day . Compared to an average of 59 unique close contacts with more than 15 25 minutes of interaction in a UK community setting over a 14 - day period ( 28 ) , this was 5 times 26 higher , further illustrating the intensity of contacts during such events . More than 70 % of the 27 close and casual contacts on the cruises occurred in F & B locations where passengers were 28 largely mask - off and thus posing a higher risk of infection and transmission . We observed that 29 the number of close contacts plateaued in F & B settings as the time spent in the location 30 increases . As such , reducing this risk potentially requires more creative use of space to 31 increase the distance between groups of passengers , improve indoor ventilation and encourage 32 more outdoor dining . 33 34 With numerous work functions interfacing with passengers , and given the overlapping shifts and 35 closely related job scope between crew ( e . g . F & B and galley , hotel services and housekeeping ) , 36 we found it only took around 3 generations for the infection to spread from a passenger to a 37 crew before reaching another crew in a different department . Crew and event personnel play an 38 important role in ensuring smooth operations and their wellbeing should be accounted for in the 39 plans when reopening events . Hence , besides encouraging crew cohorting , interventions that 40 minimise transmission in passengers would have an indirect effect of protecting the crew . 41 42 When applied individually , none of the interventions analysed were capable of reducing the 43 expected outbreak size to be lower than one ; the number of initial infected cases in passengers , 44 equivalent to a community incidence of 1 per 1 , 000 individuals . However , a combination of rapid 45 antigen testing at the start and halfway through the sailing with at least 25 % coverage of a 46 vaccine that confers 50 % protection against infection and 50 % lowered infectiousness would 47 result in the cruise event having fewer onward transmission than the number of initial infectives . 48 This is conditioned on the cases exhibiting Delta variant - like high viral loads with prolonged 49 .

While PCR tests 1 have a higher sensitivity than rapid antigen tests at low viral load levels , the tests need to be 2 conducted on land prior to the event due to the turnaround time required and for validity of lab 3 results . This implies that cases who develop symptoms several days after the sailing may not be 4 identified prior to the event , due to viral loads near the limits of detection , and large outbreaks 5 could occur . 6 7 The expected outbreak size under different combinations of interventions was sensitive to the 8 assumptions of the network edge weights . When edges are weighted by the proportion of days 9 with recorded interaction over a three - day sail period , two individuals with transient contact in a 10 day are assumed to have the same risk as two individuals with close contact in a day . This 11 assumption is applicable when the dominant mode of transmission is largely independent of the 12 duration of contact ( e . g . environmental or airborne transmission ) . There were 5 times more 13 transient interactions than close contacts and these contacts are now equally at risk of infection . 14 Thus , mask wearing would largely help to lower the risk of transmission and acquiring infection , 15 and outperforms PCR testing or even twice antigen testing interventions especially when the 16 proportion of presymptomatic transmission is high during the early stage of viral shedding . 17 18 Both mask - off , rapid antigen testing and mask - on , once - off PCR testing would help to reduce 19 the risk of disease introduction and further transmission if the index cases successfully escape 20 initial detection . While their differences in the expected outbreak size was less than 10 cases 21 across different assumptions to the edge weights , they bring different outcomes to the 22 passenger experience and operations planning — an extra swab test at the middle of the event 23 versus wearing a mask at all times other than during dining and engaged in sports , logistics to 24 check the test outcomes versus monitoring mask wearing practices , managing false positives 25 versus passengers flouting rules . 26 27 One limitation to our study was that we did not model contact tracing around detected cases . 28 While cruise lines are trained to trace and quarantine close contacts as part of the pilot 29 reopening , as the ease of rapid testing increases with fast turnaround time , this could serve as a 30 replacement for slower and resource intensive contact tracing in such settings . With pre - 31 symptomatic transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 and high levels of transmissibility of the Delta 32 variant , the effectiveness of contact tracing is approaching a point of saturation in many 33 countries ( 30 ) . Furthermore , even if the threshold for close contact to be traced is lowered , the 34 corresponding exponential increase in contacts fulfilling this criteria would make it logistically 35 challenging to trace all individuals in a reasonable amount of time . Fully asymptomatic infections 36 – as opposed to presymptomatic infections – were also not considered in the analysis . Should 37 these infections exhibit lowered viral load , the testing interventions would be less likely to detect 38 asymptomatic individuals but any potential for increase in outbreak size would be counteracted 39 by their lowered infectiousness . Currently , there is no strong evidence to suggest that 40 asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 Delta infections are less infectious than symptomatic individuals 41 ( 31 , 32 ) . Lastly , the accuracy of the data collected is largely dependent on the usage behaviour . 42 Passengers are required to carry the contact tracing devices at all times except when engaged 43 in water sports . Hence , interactions at the water sports areas may not be well represented but 44 this effect to our analysis is expected to be minor as the cruise line of study required 45 passengers to book these facilities in advance to facilitate crowd control . In a cabin , each 46 passenger’s device may not necessarily be placed in a 2m proximity and the frequent close 47 contact interactions in these settings would not be recorded accurately . However , given that 48 individuals in the cabin would largely continue to interact with each other outside the cabin while 49 carrying the device , this would help to record a large proportion of their close interaction . Thus , 50 this limitation is reduced when the probability of infection saturates after a certain level of 51 .

Despite such limitations , this is one of the few 1 studies with large - and fine - scale data collection from multiple events in one setting and 2 comparison with future studies of similar data collection methods in these settings may help to 3 strengthen our findings . 4 5 With the ongoing spread of the highly transmissible SARS - CoV - 2 Delta variant alongside 6 increasing vaccination coverage , many countries have oscillated between reopening and 7 restrictions of varying extents , in turn affecting the sustainability of economic and social 8 activities . As the pressure to resume large - scale events increases , but the effectiveness of 9 vaccines against infection and transmission remains variable , combining social interaction data 10 with models such as the one presented here can enable an improved data - driven assessment 11 of the risk of transmission arising from planned activities and the potential reduction offered by 12 the continuation and implementation of non - pharmaceutical interventions . 13 14 Materials and methods 15 Data 16 Each cruise sailing lasts for three days — departing at 7pm on the first day and arriving at 8am 17 on the last day , and only contacts during this period were studied . Embarking and disembarking 18 begins and ends at approximately 12 noon on both days and devices are stored together prior 19 to issuance or after collection . As such , data prior to departure and after arrival were not used , 20 as the recorded data may be an artefact of devices being stored together . 21 22 All individuals onboard a cruise are issued a digital contact tracing device with a unique device 23 identification number . These devices are calibrated based on signal strength to broadcast 24 Bluetooth signals to other devices within a 2m radius every 14 . 9 seconds followed by a scan of 25 nearby signals lasting for 0 . 1 seconds . Each scan record captures the timestamp of the signal 26 exchange and the identification number of the interacted device . After every five minute interval , 27 the records of 30 unique devices with the highest signal strength in each device are then stored . 28 The stored records are then uploaded to a server on land . Further data processing is required to 29 determine the duration of contact between two individuals . If there are two or more records with 30 consecutive difference ( s ) of less than five minutes , the duration of contact is the difference of 31 the last and first timestamp in the series of records . 32 33 For each cruise sailing , we collected a de - identified manifest with the device identification 34 number and details of the device holder ( passenger or crew ; for crew : department of the crew ; 35 for passengers : cabin number , keycard number , age , gender ) . The cruise ship can be 36 demarcated into different areas based on the activities in a location ( i . e . type of location : food 37 and beverage ( F & B ) , entertainment , shops , sports , public areas ) and all passengers were 38 required to tap - in using their keycards upon entering a new area onboard the cruise ship . We 39 also collected a de - identified list of entry records with each record capturing the keycard 40 number , location and timestamp of entry . 41 42 Using the three data sources ( i . e . contact data , de - identified manifest and de - identified location 43 records ) , we categorised the contacts between each dyad into one of four contact groups , 44 namely ( i ) passenger - passenger contact from within the same travelling group ( i . e . passengers 45 in the same cabin or having a cumulative contact duration of more than 5 hours over three 46 days ) , ( ii ) passenger - passenger contact from different travelling groups , ( iii ) crew - crew contact , 47 .

For each 8 individual in each type of location , we estimated the number of different types of contacts ( i . e . 9 close , casual and transient contact ) with passengers from different travelling groups over time 10 spent in the location . Across the sailings , for each type of contact , we estimated the proportion 11 of contacts occurring at a type of location over all types of location . 12 13 Social Network Construction 14 We performed a preliminary social network analysis and estimated the weighted degree 15 distribution ( number of contacts made per individual with each contact weighted by the duration 16 of contact , to be elaborated ) , the distribution of the clustering coefficient ( a measure of the 17 triadic linkage among individuals ) and individuals’ eigenvector centrality ( a measure of direct 18 and indirect centrality within a network ) of passengers and crew in respective departments in 19 each sailing . We performed a Welch’s t - test to evaluate each network property for passengers 20 against that for crew and p - values < 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant . While the 21 mean and interquartile range ( IQR ) of each estimate fluctuate across sailings , the 95 % range of 22 the estimates exhibit substantial overlap ( Fig . S1 ) . As such , we selected contact data collected 23 over a single sailing with 1208 passengers and 1032 crew to construct the social network for 24 simulating disease transmission . Supplementary simulations were also performed on other 25 sailings to ensure consistency in the percentage reduction in outbreak size for various outbreak 26 interventions across the sailing ( Supplementary fig . 7 ) . 27 28 In the main analysis , we generated an undirected network with the strength of an edge weighted 29 as a value between 0 and 1 based on the proportion of days with recorded contact over a three - 30 day sail period and the exponent transformation of the mean daily cumulative contact duration 31 between two individuals as follows : 32 33 34 (cid:0) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:5)1 (cid:7) (cid:8) (cid:3)(cid:4) (cid:0)(cid:2) (cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:6) (cid:9) 35 where (cid:0) (cid:0)(cid:2) is the weight of a contact between individuals (cid:10) and (cid:11) , (cid:4) (cid:0)(cid:2) is the proportion of days with 36 recorded contact and (cid:12) (cid:7)(cid:8) (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) is the mean daily cumulative contact duration expressed hours . (cid:14) is a 37 scalar of 0 . 5 to approximate a scenario where the edge weight reaches 95 % saturation after 3 38 hours of contact ( (cid:0) (cid:0)(cid:2) → 1 ) . As a sensitivity analysis , we explored other weightings for the 39 network edges ; similar to the above but 95 % saturation to the same level of infection risk after 1 40 hour of contact , or based on the proportion of days over the entire sailing with recorded contact 41 only . These scenarios depict how risk of infection increases based on contact duration as 42 observed in SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks in settings of poor ventilation ( 37 , 38 ) or transmission 43 driven by a highly transmissible pathogen onboard cruises such as norovirus ( 39 ) . 44 45 Transmission Model 46 .

Initial cases among passengers 1 Scaling parameter 0 . 24 - 0 . 26 Each network formulation uses one scaling parameter value to calibrate the probability of Delta infection among cabin contacts to be similar to that of household contacts of 20 % ( 29 , 41 , 42 ) . The range of values used across the different network formulations are as shown . 8 9 For each simulation , we assume that the disease is introduced by one passenger who could be 10 infected up to 14 days prior to the event , with equal probability on any of the days but the onset 11 of the index case would only occur between the start ( i . e . day 1 ) and the end ( i . e . day 7 ) of the 12 event . The distribution of the symptoms onset date , (cid:15) , on respective day of the event , (cid:12) , is as 13 follows : 14 15 (cid:15)(cid:5)(cid:12)(cid:9) (cid:3) (cid:16) (cid:17)(cid:5)(cid:18)(cid:9)(cid:19)(cid:5)(cid:12) (cid:20) | (cid:18) | (cid:9)(cid:12)(cid:18) (cid:9) (cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:11) 16 where (cid:18) is the day of infection prior to the event ( i . e . (cid:18) = 0 represents the day before the start of 17 event ) , (cid:17)(cid:5)(cid:18)(cid:9) is the probability of being infected on any of the 14 days prior to the event and is 18 fixed at 1 / 14 , (cid:19) is the incubation period distribution with (cid:12) (cid:20) | (cid:18) | representing the time since 19 infection on the respective day of the event . 20 21 Currently , all crew are required to be tested weekly and are largely confined to the cruise except 22 during periods of shore leave , thereby reducing the risk of disease introduction by crew . Each 23 day , the model searches for susceptible individuals in contact with the infected cases who are 24 .

As there is substantial uncertainty in the 12 proportion of presymptomatic transmission for SARS - CoV - 2 ( 43 ) , for sensitivity analysis , we 13 considered a scenario where about 50 % of transmission occurred prior to symptom onset . 14 15 We multiplied the force of infection with a scaling factor , (cid:30) (cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:22) , so that the mean probability of 16 infection of a susceptible individual staying in the same cabin as an infected case is 17 approximately 20 % assuming exposure in the cabin and during all shared activities throughout 18 the entire duration of infectiousness , similar to the household attack rates for SARS - CoV - 2 19 Delta variant cases ( 29 , 41 ) .
