The aim of this study was to explore the expression and function of miRNA - 22 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) . Expression of miRNA - 22 in 100 ESCC tissues was examined by q - PCR . The correlation between miRNA - 22 level and clinicopathological features was analyzed using SPSS16 . 0 statistical software . Moreover , the effect of miRNA - 22 expression on radiosensitivity of ESCC cells was examined . miRNA - 22 expression decreased in ESCC tissues , and statistical analyses showed that the expression of miRNA - 22 was associated with the stage of clinical classification . No correlation was found between miRNA - 22 expression and the overall sur - vival of ESCC patients . However , significant positive correlation was found between miRNA - 22 expression and the survival of patients who received radiotherapy ( P < 0 . 05 ) . Increased expression of miRNA - 22 sensi - tized ESCC cells to γ - ray radiation and promoted the apoptosis of ESCC cells induced by γ - ray radiation . Increased expression level of miRNA - 22 had effects on Rad51 expression after irradiation . These results demonstrate for the first time that decreased miRNA - 22 expression correlates with increased radiotherapy resistance of ESCC , and that this effect is mediated , at least in part , by the Rad51 pathway . Keywords : miRNA - 22 ; ESCC ; γ - ray ; radiosensitivity ; Rad51 INTRODUCTION Esophageal carcinoma ( EC ) is a highly malignant disease with an overall 5 - year survival rate of less than 10 % . The worldwide incidence of EC is increasing , particularly for adenocarcinoma located in the lower esophagus and gastroe - sophageal junction . In contrast to that of western countries , esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) is the most prevalent type of EC in China . Radiotherapy has the widest application to ESCC patients , and plays a central role in con - temporary treatment concepts [ 1 , 2 ] . Unfortunately , local failure remains a major concern , with persistent or recurrent disease being reported in around 40 – 60 % of patients [ 3 , 4 ] . So , the radiosensitization is a promising approach to improv - ing the therapeutic ratio for irradiation . miRNAs are conserved 19 – 22 nucleotide non - coding RNAs . They repress protein expression at the post - transcriptional level , mainly by annealing with the 3 ′ UTR of the target mRNA and interfering with its translation and / or stability [ 5 ] . The precise number of miRNA genes in the human genome is still unknown , but estimates of the total number of miRNA precursors are as high as 25 000 . These molecules are thought to regulate approximately 30 % of the genes in the human genome [ 6 , 7 ] . Studies have shown that some miRNAs regulate cellular differentiation , proliferation and apoptotic processes that are important in cancer aggrava - tion . miRNA profiling across multiple human cancers has suggested that miRNAs are potential indicators of the devel - opmental origin of poorly differentiated cancers . In the present study , we found that miRNA - 22 expression decreased in ESCC tissues , and that its expression was positively asso - ciated with the survival of patients who received radiotherapy . In addition , increased miRNA - 22 expression promoted radio - sensitivity of ESCC cells .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Tissue specimens One hundred fresh tissue samples , which contained ESCC and the adjacent histologically normal tissue , were procured from surgical resection specimens collected by the Department of Tumor Medicine , Shandong Provincial Chest Hospital from 2001 to 2007 . Primary tumor regions and the corresponding histologically normal tissues from the same patients were separated by experienced pathologists and immediately stored at – 70°C until use . None of the patients received treatment before surgery , and all signed informed consent forms for sample collection . Of these 100 patients , 58 received concurrent chemotherapy with radiation therapy after surgery . Radiation therapy was administered in daily divided doses with linear accelerators , and all patients received thoracic irradiation with daily fraction doses of 2 . 0 Gy for a total dose 50 Gy . The chemotherapy program was Cisplatin ( CDDP ) + 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - FU ) . The other 42 patients were treated with chemotherapy only . Use of patient samples of tumors and adjacent histologically normal tissues was approved by the institutional Ethics Committee . RNA extraction Total RNA was extracted from ESCC tissue and the corre - sponding normal tissue using the Absolutely RNA ™ Miniprep kit ( Stratagene , Santa Clara , CA ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . RNA quantification was per - formed with a DUVR 800 UV / Vis Spectrophotometer ( Beckman Coulter , Fullerton , CA ) . Quantitative reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction TaqMan miRNA assays ( ABI PRISM , Carisbad , CA ) were used to detect the expression levels of mature miRNA - 22 . For the reverse transcription ( RT ) reactions , 10 ng of total RNA was used in each reaction and mixed with the RT primer . RT reactions were performed at 16 ˚ C for 30 min , 42 ˚ C for 30 min , 85 ˚ C for 5 min and then maintained at 4 ˚ C . Following the RT reactions , 1 . 5 µl of cDNA was used for a polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) using 2 µl of the TaqMan primers . The PCR was conducted at 95 ˚ C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 ˚ C for 15 sec and 60 ˚ C for 60 sec in an ABI 7500 real - time PCR system . The real - time PCR results were analyzed and expressed as the relative miRNA level using the U6 snRNA for normalization pur - poses . The RT and PCR primers for miRNA - 22 were pur - chased from ABI PRISM ( ABI PRISM , Carisbad , CA ) . The fold change in the miRNA expression in each tumor sample relative to the average expression in the non - cancerous control was calculated based on the threshold cycle ( CT ) value using the following formula : Relative gene expression = 2 − ΔΔ C t , where – ΔΔ C t = ( C t gene of interest – C t internal control gene ) Treated – ( C t gene of interest – C t internal control gene ) Untreated [ 8 ] . A 2 - fold change in either direction was considered to be significant . Cell lines The ESCC cell lines EC9706 and KYSE150 were pur - chased from the tumor cell bank of the Chinese Academy of Medical Science . These cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with 10 % FBS . Ionizing radiation KYSE150 or EC9706 cells were exposed to different doses of irradiation in a JL Shepherd Model 143 and 137 Cesium γ - irradiated at a rate of 2 . 4 Gy / min . miRNA northern blots For miRNA northern blots , 15 µg of total RNA was sepa - rated on a 15 % denaturing polyacrylamide gel , electro - transferred onto a GeneScreen Plus hybridization transfer membrane ( PerkinElmer , Waltham , Mass ) and hybridized using ULTRAhyb - Oligo buffer ( Ambion , Austin , TX ) . Oligonucleotides complementary to the mature miRNA - 22 were end - labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) and used as probes . Hybridization was per - formed at 42°C overnight , and the membranes were washed twice in 0 . 1 × SSPE and 0 . 1 % SDS at 42°C for 15 min each . The membranes were then exposed to a storage phosphor screen ( GE Healthcare Bio - Sciences , Piscataway , NJ ) for 8 h and imaged using a Typhoon 9410 Variable Mode Imager ( GE Healthcare Bio - Sciences , Piscataway , NJ ) ) . Saved images were cropped using Photoshop 6 . 0 ( Adobe Systems Inc . , San Jose , CA ) . Western blot analysis Whole cell extracts were prepared from ESCC tissues and cultured cells by homogenizing cells in a lysis buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % NP40 ) con - taining a cocktail of protease inhibitors . After centrifugation at 15 000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C , supernatants were recov - ered and used for immunoblot analysis . The proteins were separated by SDS - PAGE and then transferred to polyvinyli - dene difluoride membranes ( Millipore ) . Blots were blocked and then probed with Rad51 ( 1 : 500 , Santa Cruz ) , Ku70 ( 1 : 500 , Santa Cruz ) and β - actin ( 1 : 5000 , Abcam ) . After washing , the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized by super ECL detection reagent ( Applygen , Beijing , China ) . Plasmid construction and cell transfection The miRNA - 22 expression vector was constructed by cloning of annealed oligonucleotides that contained the pre - miRNA - 22 sequence into the pSuppressorNeo expres - sion vector . A scrambled sequence without significant X . Wang et al . 402 homology to any rat , mouse or human gene was used as a negative control ( vector group ) ( ABI PRISM , Carisbad , CA ) . Anti - miR TM miRNA - 22 inhibitor ( ABI PRISM , Carisbad , CA ) was used to knockdown miRNA - 22 expres - sion . The expression constructs or inhibitor were transfected into the KYSE150 or EC9706 cell line , respectively , using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . A northern blot was used to confirm the overexpression of miRNA - 22 . Colony formation assay A total of 400 cells were aliquoted into each well of a 6 - well plate in triplicate and exposed to γ - rays with differ - ent irradiation dose . After 10 days of incubation , the col - onies were stained with Giemsa stain , and a minimum of 50 viable cells were counted . Quantity One software ( version 4 . 6 . 2 ) was used to analyze the results . γ - H2AX foci formation assay Briefly , cells were grown in cover slips kept in 35 mm petri plates and irradiated with different dosages ( 0 , 2 , 4 and 6 Gy ) of γ - rays . Cell layers were washed with PBS and fixed for 20 min in 4 % paraformaldehyde at room temperature ; afterwards the cells were washed twice in PBS . For immuno - fluorescence staining , cells were permeabilized for 3 min in 0 . 25 % Triton X - 100 in PBS , washed two times in PBS and blocked for 1 h with 5 % BSA in PBS . Antibody was diluted ( 1 : 200 ) in 1 % BSA in PBS . Cells were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature , washed three times in PBS and incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature . Finally , cells were rinsed and mounted with ProLong Gold antifede with DAPI mounting media ( Molecular Probe , USA ) . Images were captured using a Carl Zeiss confocal microscope . Acquisition settings were opti - mized to obtain maximal signal in immunostained cells with minimal background . A total of 200 nuclei were counted . All experiments were carried out in triplicates , independent - ly from each other . The primary antibodies used were rabbit anti - γ H2AX ( Cell Signaling , USA ) . Secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti - rabbit IgG ( Molecular Probe , USA ) . Flow cytometry Cells were harvested 8 h post - irradiation with a dose of 0 , 2 , 4 and 6 Gy for apoptosis detection using the annexin V - FITC apoptosis detection kit ( Sigma ) , and subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry . Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS16 . 0 software . We statistically evaluated experimental results using a x 2 test and an ANOVA test . Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan – Meier method . P < 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . RESULTS The expression of miRNA - 22 in ESCC tissue and its correlation with clinicopathological features Expression of miRNA - 22 was detected in 100 ESCC samples and the adjacent histologically normal tissues using RT - qPCR . miRNA - 22 expression was normalized to the control U6B small nuclear RNA gene ( RNU6B ) . The results showed that miRNA - 22 expression levels were sig - nificantly lower in ESCC tissues compared with the corre - sponding non - cancerous tissues ( Fig . 1 ) . Statistical analyses showed that the expression of miRNA - 22 was only associated with the stage of clinical classification ( Table 1 ) . To determine if miRNA - 22 expres - sion was association with prognosis , a Kaplan – Meier sur - vival analysis and a log - rank test were performed . No correlation was found between miRNA - 22 expression and overall survival ( P = 0 . 237 , Fig . 2A ) . In the patients who did not receive radiotherapy ( 42 out of 100 ) , no difference was found between miRNA - 22 high - expression and low - expression patients ( P = 0 . 425 , Fig . 2B ) . In contrast , in patients who received concurrent chemotherapy with radi - ation therapy ( 58 out of 100 ) , the survival rate of miRNA - 22 high - expression patients was higher than that of miRNA - 22 low - expression patients ( P = 0 . 042 , Fig . 2C ) . These results showed that the miRNA - 22 expression status may have effects on the radiotherapy outcome of ESCC patients . Fig . 1 . Expression of miRNA - 22 is down - regulated in ESCC tissues . The miRNA - 22 expression was analyzed by qRT - PCR in normal epithelium ( N , n = 100 ) , and tumor tissues ( T , n = 100 ) . RNU6B served as an internal control . Role of miRNA - 22 in ESCC 403 Effects of miRNA - 22 expression on the radiosensitivity of ESCC cells Expression of miRNA - 22 in four ESCC cell lines was mea - sured using RT - qPCR . As shown in Fig . 3 , the sequence of miRNA - 22 level was EC9706 > KYSE510 > KYSE450 > KYSE150 . In the next experiments , EC9706 and KYSE150 were selected as cell models to study . A colony formation assay was performed to examine the effects of miRNA - 22 expression on the radiosensitivity of ESCC cells . The survival fraction of KYSE150 cells with forced miRNA - 22 expression was lower than that of control groups ( Fig . 4A and B ) . Conversely , the survival fraction of miRNA - 22 knockdown EC9706 cells was significantly higher than that of control groups ( Fig . 4C and D ) . These results indi - cate a positive correlation between miRNA - 22 expression and radiosensitivity of ESCC cells to gamma radiation . We also examined the effects of miRNA - 22 expression on the proliferation of ESCC cells using MTT experiments . The results obtained indicated that the proliferative ability of cells increased in low miRNA - 22 level cells and decreased in miRNA - 22 high - expression cells ( Fig . 5A and B ) . Expression of miRNA - 22 had an effect on the repair of DNA double - strand breaks induced by irradiation To investigate whether miRNA - 22 expression has an effect on the repair ability of DNA damage induced by γ - rays , we performed γ - H2AX foci formation assays 1 h post - irradiation at different dosages . The number of γ - H2X foci Fig . 2 . Kaplan - Meier survival curve of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) patients sub - grouped as miRNA - 22 negative or positive . ( A ) No difference was found between miRNA - 22 expression and the overall survival of all 100 ESCC patients . ( B ) No difference was found between miRNA - 22 expression and the overall survival of patients who received only chemotherapy . ( C ) Significant difference was found between miRNA - 22 expression and the overall survival of patients who received concurrent chemotherapy with radiotherapy . The prognosis of miRNA - 22 positive cases was significantly longer than that of miRNA - 22 negative cases ( P = 0 . 042 ) . Table 1 .

Wang et al . 404 in miRNA - 22 knockdown cells was significantly lower than in control cells after irradiation ( P < 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 6A ) . In accord with this result , the percentage of apoptotic cells with a low miRNA - 22 level was significantly lower than that of control cells ( P < 0 . 05 ) ( Fig . 6B ) . Conversely , the number of γ - H2X foci in forced miRNA - 22 expression cells was significantly increased ( Fig . 6C ) . The percentage of apoptotic cells with a high miRNA - 22 level was signifi - cantly higher than that of control cells ( P < 0 . 05 ) ( Fig . 6D ) . These data show that miRNA - 22 expression can affect the repair ability of DSBs induced by irradiation . We next examined the expression of two key proteins Rad51 and Ku70 , which were correlated with DNA double - strand breaks ( DSBs ) repair . As shown in Fig . 7A , Rad51 expression increased after miRNA - 22 knockdown after ir - radiation , but the Ku70 level did not change . Forced ex - pression of miRNA - 22 decreased Rad51 expression after irradiation and the Ku70 expression was not affected ( Fig . 7B ) . DISCUSSION Studies have shown that miRNA expression fingerprints correlate with the clinical and biological characteristics of tumors , including tissue type , differentiation , aggression , re - sponse to therapy and prognosis [ 9 ] . Thus , a large amount of diagnostic information is encoded in a relatively small amount of miRNA . Liu et al . found that the miRNA - 143 and miRNA - 145 clusters were statistically different between esophageal cancer tissues and matched controls . The combined expression of miRNA - 143 and miRNA - 145 was significantly associated with a risk for EC [ 10 ] . miRNA - 25 was found to be upregulated in 60 ESCC tissues compared with matched adjacent non - cancerous tissues . The upregulation of miRNA - 25 was significantly correlated with status of lymph node metastasis and TNM stage , and markedly promoted migration and invasion of ESCC cells [ 11 ] . Kurashiqe et al . reported that the serum concentration of miRNA - 21 in ESCC patients was Fig . 4 . Effects of miRNA - 22 expression on the radiosensitivity of ESCC cells . ( A ) Expression of miRNA - 22 increased after positive transfection of KYSE150 cells . ( B ) The colony formation assay was performed after parental , vector and vector + miRNA - 22 cells were radiated using γ - rays with different dose irradiation . Data points shown represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments . Asterisks indicate P < 0 . 05 . ( C ) Expression of miRNA - 22 decreased in miRNA - 22 RNAi EC9706 cells . ( D ) Data points shown represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments . Asterisks indicate P < 0 . 05 . Fig . 3 . Expression of miRNA - 22 in four kinds of ESCC cells . The sequence of miRNA - 22 level was EC9706 > KYSE510 > KYSE450 > KYSE150 . Role of miRNA - 22 in ESCC 405 significantly higher than that in healthy controls . A signifi - cant reduction in serum miRNA - 21 levels was observed in post - operative samples vs pre - operative samples [ 12 ] . Other miRNA , such as miRNA - 223 [ 13 ] , miR - 142 - 3p [ 14 ] and let - 7 [ 15 ] were all found to have effects on ESCC progress . MiRNA - 22 was previously reported to be a tumor suppres - sor . The relative expression level of miRNA - 22 in lung cancer tissues was lower than that in normal tissues . Overexpression of miRNA - 22 was shown to significantly inhibit the proliferation and invasion of lung cancer cell lines [ 16 ] . miRNA - 22 expression was downregulated in hepatic cell cancer ( HCC ) , and low miRNA - 22 expression was predictive of poor survival in HCC patients . Overexpression of miRNA - 22 significantly inhibited HCC cell proliferation and tumourigenicity [ 17 ] . However , the expression status of miRNA - 22 in ESCC has not been reported until recently . Here , we detected the expression levels of miRNA - 22 and investigated whether miRNA - 22 expression also correlated with the clinicopathological fea - tures and prognosis of ESCC patients . Our results showed that miRNA - 22 levels were decreased in ESCC patients , and a statistical analysis showed that the expression of miRNA - 22 was negatively associated with the stage of clin - ical classification . Because some patients in our study received radiotherapy treatment and others did not , more - over , the chemotherapy project for all 100 patients was the same , we want to know if the miRNA - 22 expression has an effect on the radiotherapy outcome for ESCC patients . Our results showed that the survival time of patients with high miRNA - 22 expression was longer than that of patients with low miRNA - 22 expression following radiotherapy , but miRNA - 22 had no effect on survival time in patients who did not receive radiotherapy . This is the first report of a cor - relation between miRNA - 22 expression and radiotherapy outcome . To confirm the clinical data , we explored the correlation between miRNA - 22 expression and radiosensitivity in ESCC cells . The colony formation and MTT assay proved that an increased miRNA - 22 level prompted radiation sensi - tization of EC9706 cells . The radiosensitivity of cells is influenced by many factors . One of the most important factors is the repair ability of DNA DSBs . If the damage induced by radiation can be efficiently repaired , the cell will survive , otherwise the cell will undergo apoptosis . Given that our data proved overexpression of miRNA - 22 increased the radiation sensitivity of ESCC cells , we hypothesize that this is due to miRNA - 22 affecting the repair ability of DSBs induced by radiation in ESCC cells . The results of our γ H2X foci experiment proved our hypothesis . There are two pathways for repairing DSBs , homologous recombination ( HR ) and non - homologous end - joining ( NHEJ ) . Rad51 is a key protein in the HR DNA repair pathway . It is the major strand - transferase required for mitotic recombination [ 18 ] . The NHEJ pathway repairs the DNA by a homology - inde - pendent mechanism , rejoining broken ends irrespective of the sequence . Upon exposure to different genotoxic insults , the Ku70 / 80 heterodimer ( Ku ) binds to the broken DNA ends and recruits the catalytic subunit of the DNA - depend - ent protein kinase ( DNA - PKcs ) . The formation of this complex results in the subsequent recruitment and phos - phorylation of other proteins , such as XRCC4 , DNA Ligase IV , Cernunnos / XLF and Artemis , so as to ligate the broken DNA ends [ 19 ] . To further explore the molecular mechan - ism of miRNA - 22 affecting DSBs repair , we then measured the expression levels of Rad51 and Ku70 in miRNA - 22 knockdown cells by forced expression after irradiation . The results indicated that miRNA - 22 only affected the expres - sion of Rad51 . Overexpression of the Rad51 protein has been reported to stimulate homologous recombination and increase resistance of mammalian cells to ionizing radiation [ 20 ] . This result , combined with our data , suggests that downregulation of miRNA - 22 can promote the repair ability of DSBs induced by γ - ray irradiation in ESCC cells , and that this effect is mediated , at least in part , by the Rad51 pathway . Tan et al . reported that miRNA - 22 was upregu - lated in cells exposed to UV radiation , protecting cells from Fig . 5 . Effects of miRNA - 22 expression on the proliferation of ESCC cells . MTT assay was performed after three groups of cells were radiated using γ - ray with a dose of 6 Gy . A , Proliferation ability of EC9706 cells with decreased miRNA - 22 level was significant higher than that of control cells ( P < 0 . 05 ) . B , Proliferation ability of KYSE150 cells with increased miRNA - 22 level was significant lower than that of control cells ( P < 0 . 05 ) . X . Wang et al . 406 apoptosis by repressing PTEN expression . This UV stress response may inhibit the acute activation of the caspase sig - naling cascade and provide a time window for cells to repair the DNA damage induced by UV [ 21 ] . These various results show that miRNA - 22 can play different roles in the context of different malignancies and different types of irradiation . Further studies should be implemented to explore the potential mechanism . CONCLUSION In conclusion , we have found , for the first time , that miRNA - 22 expression is correlated with the prognosis of ESCC patients who receive radiotherapy . An increased miRNA - 22 level inhibited the DSBs repair ability of ESCC cells , at least in part through the HR pathway , thereby improving the radiation sensitivity of ESCC cells .
