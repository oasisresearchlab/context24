This DEP system consists of mercury as a movable liquid electrode , indium tin oxide ( ITO ) - coated glass , SU - 8 - based microchannels for electrode passages , and a PDMS medium chamber . A simple squeezing method was introduced to build a thin PDMS layer at the bottom of the medium chamber to create a contactless DEP system . To determine the operating conditions , the DEP force and the friction force were analytically compared for a single cell . In addition , an appropriate frequency range for effective DEP manipulation was chosen based on an estimation of the Clausius – Mossotti factor and the effective complex permittivity of the yeast cell using the concentric shell model . With this system , we demonstrated the active manipulation of yeast cells , and measured the collection efﬁciency and the dielectrophoretic velocity of cells for different AC electric ﬁeld strengths and applied frequencies . The experimental results showed that the maximum collection efﬁciency reached was approximately 90 % , and the dielectrophoretic velocity increased with increasing frequency and attained the maximum value of 10 . 85 ± 0 . 95 (cid:2) m / s at 100 kHz , above which it decreased .

It has been widely used tomanipulateparticlesandcellswithdifferentdielectricprop - erties . DEP force also depends on a particle shape , size , and frequency of electric ﬁelds . In addition , DEP can manipulate and sort biological cells without a biochemical labeling or other bio - engineered tags , and any contact materials to solid Correspondence : Professor Seong Hyuk Lee , School of Mechani - cal Engineering , Chung - Ang University , Heuksuk - dong , Dongjak - gu , Seoul , Korea E - mail : shlee89 @ cau . ac . kr Abbreviations : cDEP , contactless dielectrophoresis ; CM , Clausius—Mossotti ; iDEP , insulator - based dielectrophore - sis ; ITO , indium tin oxide ; ODEP , optically induced dielec - trophoresis ; Tw - DEP , travelling wave dielectrophoresis surface of particles and cells [ 1 , 2 ] . However , there are in - trinsic limitations in conventional DEP techniques involving on - chip metal electrodes . Metal electrodes can be corroded by direct contact with ﬂuid media , and any degradation due to metal corrosion , bubble formation , and fouling , substan - tially affects sensing accuracy and repeatability [ 3 ] . Secondly , it is difﬁcult to manipulate particles and cells actively by us - ing conventional DEP techniques because the particles and cells are collected or repelled around the patterning of metal electrodes only . To overcome these limitations of conventional DEP technology , many researchers have developed improved tech - nologies . In particular , a contactless DEP ( cDEP ) technique was developed to resolve corrosion and fouling problems in metal electrodes [ 4 ] . An insulator - based electrodeless ∗ These authors have contributed equally to this study . Colour Online : See the article online to view Fig . 2 in colour .

The operating con - cept of the liquid - drop elec - trode DEP technique with ( A ) AC ﬁeld off ; ( B ) AC ﬁeld on . dielectrophoresis ( iDEP ) was also developed to prevent direct contact between electrodes and solutions [ 5 ] . Lapizco - Encinas et al . [ 6 ] also demonstrated an iDEP for the manipulation of bacteria and inert particles , while Sano et al . [ 7 ] fabricated microﬂuidic devices based on iDEP and cDEP . However , it is difﬁcult to use iDEP and cDEP to manipulate particles and cells actively owing to the use of prescribed patterns to collect particles . Alternatively , other DEP techniques such as step - ping electric ﬁeld DEP [ 8 ] , travelling wave DEP ( Tw - DEP ) [ 9 ] , and optically induced DEP ( ODEP ) [ 10 , 11 ] have been proposed . ODEP facilitates active manipulation of particles and cells , but heat or bubble generation problems may occur owing to the focused light source . Although there have been many efforts to manipulate particles or biological cells in lab - on - a - chip ( LOC ) systems , and active manipulation of particles still remains a challenging task . In active cell manipulation , cells can be manipulated on any desired local positions without prepatterned metal electrodes at a desired time . This study suggests a new DEP system for effective parti - cle manipulation by actively controlling the location of an electrically conductive liquid metal , which is used as the electrode instead of patterned surface electrodes . A newly designed microﬂuidic DEP device was fabricated to demon - strate this new technique for manipulating particles and cells . To determine the optimal DEP operating conditions , the the - oretical complex permittivity of various yeast cells was cal - culated ; it was required to calculate the real and imaginary terms of the corresponding Clausius – Mossotti ( CM ) factor . A new squeezing method was also introduced to make a thin PDMS layer between the electrode path and the medium . In experiments , DEP velocities and collection efﬁciencies were measured at different AC electric ﬁeld strengths and frequencies . 2 Materials and methods 2 . 1 Design and fabrication of a DEP system TheprominentadvantageofthenewDEPsystemisactivema - nipulation with the movable liquid drop . The operating con - cept of the new DEP system for active manipulation ( positive DEP ) is illustrated in Fig . 1 . The liquid drop moves to desired position by operating syringe pump as shown in Fig . 1A . By applying an AC voltage to top and bottom ITO - coated glass , nonuniform electric ﬁelds can be generated inside the sam - ple chamber . The liquid drop acts as the electrode , then , sus - pended particles are collected to the liquid electrode , which is located at a desired position as shown in Fig . 1B . The new DEP system consists of indium tin oxide ( ITO ) - coated glasses at its top and bottom , SU - 8 microchannels to guide movable electrodes , and a PDMS sample chamber ( Fig . 2A ) . ITO - coated glasses are chosen because of optically transparent and electrically conductive characteristics . In or - der to make a thin insulating layer between the sample cham - ber and the microchannel , glass , photoresist , and PDMS can be possibly used . Among them , PDMS was chosen for fab - ricating a thin layer between the medium chamber and the microchannel due to its inherent characteristics . It is because PDMS is an elastomer widely used in microﬂuidic devices due to its low cost and ease of fabrication , while electrical re - sistivity of PDMS is relatively similar to that of glass and pho - toresist [ 12 , 13 ] . A sample chamber was built by replicating a negative photoresist ( SU - 8 , MicroChem , Newton , MA , USA ) patterning mold . The microchannels for the electrodes were fabricated with a negative photoresist ( SU - 8 2050 , MicroChem ) . The sample chamber and the channels were fabricated by using conventional photolithography C (cid:3) 2014 WILEY - VCH Verlag GmbH & Co .

Note that a hot press process ( 25 kPa & 100 ° C ) was employed to replicate the PDMS thin layer shown in Fig . 2D and the chemical gluing method [ 17 ] was used to bond the SU - 8 channels and the PDMS sample chamber . This new bonding strategy is realized by anchoring amine - terminated silane on one PDMS substrate and epoxy - terminated silane on the other PDMS substrate via silane coupling reaction followed by amine - epoxy bond formation . Then , conductive adhesive copper ﬁlms ( 1181 , 3M , St . Paul , MN , USA ) were taped to the top and bottom ITO - coated glass surface for applying AC voltages . To achieve an air - tightened connection between the plastic tubing and the PDMS channel , PDMS connection patches were prepared using a customized punching tool with a gage - 16 grinded blunt needle ( 5 mm inner diameter ) . Flexible microbore plas - tic tubes ( AAQ0413 , Saint - Gobain , France ) were inserted into each port . The T - shaped channel was fabricated to generate movable liquid electrode drops of mercury ( 261017 , Sigma Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) surrounded by air were po - sitioned by using two syringe pumps ( TJ - 3A and LSP04 – 1A , LongerPump , Boonton , NJ , USA ) . TheheightoftheT - shaped channel was 100 (cid:2) m . Mercury was chosen because of its easy handling , small contact angle change due to electro - wetting , and nonevaporation at this experimental condition . Alterna - tively , other conductive liquids ( such as Eutectic Gallium - Indium ) canbeused , consideringthatmercuryisahazardous material . The generation of the mercury drop of 8 nL in the T - shaped channel and its movement are shown in Fig . 3 . 2 . 2 Theoretical analysis 2 . 2 . 1 Comparison between DEP force and friction force on a single spherical particle When a liquid electrode is moved in the channel , particles may migrate to the liquid electrode . However , the particles may also exhibit frictional resistance to such migration ; therefore , a competitive relationship clearly exists between these two forces . Therefore , the particle can be only moved when the DEP force is larger than the friction force . In order to ﬁnd the appropriate DEP force ( operating conditions ) for the present system , it is necessary to compare the two forces on the particles . Supporting Information Fig . 1A illustrates the friction force and the DEP force in the x - direction for a spherical particle in a medium . Other forces , such as the C (cid:3) 2014 WILEY - VCH Verlag GmbH & Co . KGaA , Weinheim www . electrophoresis - journal . com 4 H . R . Gwon et al . Electrophoresis 2014 , 00 , 1 – 8 Figure 3 . ( A ) Generation of liquid - drop in a microchannel with T - shaped intersection and ( B ) movement of a liquid drop in a microchannel with controlled syringe pump . electrical double layer interaction force , van der Waals force , and Brownian random force are possibly present but the magnitudes of these forces are very small compared to the DEP and friction forces [ 18 ] . In general , the dielectrophoretic force acting on a spherical particle in a nonuniform electric ﬁeld is described by [ 1 ] : F DEP = 2 (cid:3) a 3 ε 0 ε m Re { K ( (cid:4) ) } ∇ | E RMS | 2 , ( 1 ) where ε 0 and ε m are the vacuum permittivity ( 8 . 85 × 10 − 12 F / m ) and unitless relative permittivity , respectively . a is the radius of the particle , E RMS is the root mean square electric ﬁeld , and (cid:4) is the angular ﬁeld frequency . Re { K ( (cid:4) ) } indicates the real part of CM factor where K ( (cid:4) ) is the particle polarizability that can be written as : K ( (cid:4) ) = ε ∗ p − ε ∗ m ε ∗ p + 2 ε ∗ m , ( 2 ) where ε ∗ p and ε ∗ m are the complex permittivities of the particle and the medium , respectively . The complex permittivity ε ∗ canbeexpressedintermsoftherelativepermittivity , electrical conductivity , and radial frequency of the electric ﬁelds , i . e . ε ∗ = ε − (cid:5)(cid:4) i . Electro - rotation means the rotation of polarized particles suspended in a liquid owing to an induced torque in a rotating electric ﬁeld . The torque is given by [ 1 ] : (cid:6) = − 4 (cid:3) ε m a 3 Im { K ( (cid:4) ) } | E RMS | 2 , ( 3 ) where Im { K ( (cid:4) ) } is the imaginary part of the CM factor . Mean - while , the friction force on a spherical particle F f can be ex - pressed by : F f = (cid:2) f m p g , ( 4 ) where (cid:2) f , m p , and g are the friction coefﬁcient , the particle mass , and the gravitational acceleration , respectively . For the PDMS surface in the wet state , the friction coefﬁcient is well known as 2 . 5 [ 19 ] . As seen in Eq . ( 4 ) , the friction force should be determined when the particle is stationary . At this con - dition , the friction force reaches its maximum value . Mean - while , the DEP force in the x - direction ( F DEP , x ) can be easily estimated as follows : F DEP , x = 2 (cid:3) a 3 ε 0 ε m Re { K ( (cid:4) ) } ∇ | E | 2 sin (cid:7) ( 5 ) SupportingInformationFig . 1Bshowsthecomparisonof the DEP force and the friction force for a 5 - (cid:2) m radius spher - ical particle . The estimated friction force is approximately 5 . 5 × 10 − 13 N , which is smaller than the DEP force ( 7 . 9 × 10 − 13 N ) at x = 0 . This supports the idea that a particle can be successively moved by overcoming the friction force . Also , theDEPforceinthe x - directionincreasesastheposition of the liquid electrode moves in the positive x direction ; how - ever , after a distance of about 30 (cid:2) m from the initial position , the DEP force in the x - direction starts decreasing because the square of the electric ﬁeld decreases more rapidly (cid:2) | E | 2 (cid:3) . Consequently , within a distance of about 200 (cid:2) m from the initial position , the DEP force in the x - direction is sufﬁciently large to overcome the friction force of the spherical particle . 2 . 2 . 2 Characteristics of the DEP force direction In general , for dielectric particles with a single layer , such as polystyrene or silica , the permittivity and conductivity are independent of frequency , and the CM factor of the medium can be easily calculated with respect to the frequency . The concentric shell model [ 16 ] is used to calculate the CM factor of biological cells due to their complicated internal structure [ 20 ] . For example , with the two layers cell ( subscript m means medium ) , the dipole moment and effective polarizability are expressed by [ 21 ] : (cid:8) = 3 ε m K ( (cid:4) ) 12 = 3 ε m (cid:4) ε ∗ 12 − ε ∗ m ε ∗ 12 + ε ∗ m (cid:5) ( 6 ) ε ∗ 12 = ε ∗ 1 (cid:6) (cid:9) 312 + 2 (cid:4) ε ∗ 2 − ε ∗ 1 ε ∗ 2 + 2 ε ∗ 1 (cid:5)(cid:7) (cid:6) (cid:9) 312 − (cid:4) ε ∗ 2 − ε ∗ 1 ε ∗ 2 + 2 ε ∗ 1 (cid:5)(cid:7) , ( 7 ) where (cid:9) 12 = a 1 / a 2 is the radius ratio of two layers . This sin - gle shell model can be extended to the concentric shell model with multi - layers . The yeast cells examined are proposed to have four shells , as seen in Supporting Information Fig . 2 , sincetheyeastcellconsistsofcytoplasm , organelles , organelle membranes , and plasma membranes . In this case , the four distinctcomplexpermittivityvaluesarereplacedbyoneequiv - alent complex permittivity , ε ∗ eq . The thickness of the yeast cell r is 2 . 95 (cid:2) m . The dielectric properties and thicknesses of the layers are listed in Supporting Information Table S1 [ 22 , 23 ] . A 25 ° C 20 mM KCl isotonic solution was used for the DEP experiments , and its unitless relative permittivity and elec - trical conductivity of the solution were 78 and 0 . 0028 S / cm , respectively [ 24 ] . Supporting Information Fig . 3A shows the calculated equivalent complex permittivity ( permittivity and the conduc - tivity ) of the yeast cell by using the concentric shell model [ 16 ] . The real and imaginary parts of the CM factor for a yeast cell in the 20 mM KCl solution are calculated by using Eq . ( 2 ) based on the calculated permittivity and conductivity , as seen in Supporting Information Fig . 3B . The real part of the CM factor is associated with the magnitude and direction of the C (cid:3) 2014 WILEY - VCH Verlag GmbH & Co . KGaA , Weinheim www . electrophoresis - journal . com Electrophoresis 2014 , 00 , 1 – 8 Microﬂuidics and Miniaturization 5 DEP force . The positive or negative DEP phenomenon is de - termined based on the polarizability of the particle relative to its surrounding medium . The positive DEP phenomenon oc - curs when the CM factor is positive . It acts in the direction of increasing electric ﬁeld gradient . On the other hand , negative DEP acts to repel the cell from regions with high electric ﬁeld strength . For the 20 mM KCl isotonic solution , the positive DEP force increases until 1 MHz and then decreases rapidly beyond that frequency . It is anticipated that the friction force in the KCl solution is still negligible because its viscosity of 0 . 87 mPa s is similar to that of water , 0 . 89 mPa s [ 25 ] . The highest value of the real part of the CM factor is estimated as 0 . 91 around 100 kHz . Physically , the imaginary part of the CM factor is directly associated with the rotational motion of a particle , in particular , its angular velocity and direction . Therefore , the rotational motion could be removed by controlling the frequency to let the particles move near the surface efﬁciently . From Supporting Information Fig . 3B , it is seen that at approximately 100 kHz , the imaginary part of the CM factor is nearly zero , indicating that at this fre - quency , the rotational energy reaches a minimum resulting in the effective translational movement of a particle . From our numerical analysis , 100 kHz was found to be an optimal frequency in this system . This corresponds to a maximum in the positive DEP force and a minimum in the rotational motion of a cell . 3 Results and discussion 3 . 1 Electric potential drop For demonstration of active manipulation of particles in the present DEP system , AC voltages were applied by a function generator ( 33210A , Agilent , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) and an AC power ampliﬁer ( A800 , FLC Electronics , Partille , Sweden ) . The movable liquid - drop electrode and the yeast cells suspended in the medium were visualized using an up - right bright ﬁeld optical microscope ( Moticam 2300 , Motic , British Columbia , Canada ) . The dielectric layers of glass , PDMS , and DI water have intrinsic high impedance charac - teristics and frequency - dependent complex conductivity [ 24 ] . For this reason , the dielectric voltage drops of the applied voltage in the thin PDMS layer should be considered nor - mal for operation of a cDEP system . In addition , similarly to the other contactless DEP systems [ 4 , 26 – 29 ] , the frequency dependency is manifested in this proposed system as well . Supporting Information Fig . 4 shows that the measured applied voltage with respect to frequency can be changed due to the drop of voltage through a PDMS thin layer sur - face . The applied voltage is a peak - to - peak voltage and the dropped voltages are RMS voltages . The dropped voltages acrossthethinPDMSlayerinsamplechannelweremeasured with the general Wheatstone bridge circuit . The maximum measured voltage is measured approximately 750 V for the 800 V apparent voltages and remains constant up to 100 kHz , but it monotonically decreases after 100 kHz , owing to the bandwidth characteristics of the used power ampliﬁer . The dropped voltage becomes low for the maximum voltage ap - plied up to a frequency of about 30 kHz because of the high impedance characteristics of PDMS [ 30 ] . It has been reported that the minimum electric ﬁeld is approximately 0 . 2 kV / cm ( with about 100 (cid:2) m electrode distance ) for DEP manipula - tion [ 31 ] . According to other literature , the electric ﬁeld of 2 kV / cm is the limitation electric ﬁeld for avoiding substan - tial yeast cell killing [ 32 ] , and the electric ﬁeld of 0 . 72 kV / cm has no critical Joule heating problem in the yeast cells [ 33 ] . In Supporting Information Fig . 4 , it is shown that the maximum dielectric dropped voltage for the 30 - (cid:2) m thin PDMS layer is about 7 . 2 V at 100 kHz . Accordingly , electric ﬁeld range 0 . 2 kV / cm ( dropped voltage of 2 V ) through 0 . 72 kV / cm ( dropped voltage of 7 . 2 V ) was selected in the present DEP system based on our parametric study and the literature on manipulation of yeast cells . In addition , a suitable operating frequency was determined in the range 1 to 100 kHz approx - imately . 3 . 2 Effect of applied voltage and frequency on cell manipulation efﬁciency In the present experiment , yeast cells were used to demon - strate active manipulation . To prepare a suspension of live yeast cells , 20 mg of yeast powder ( Instant Dry Yeast , Vega , Istanbul , Turkey ) was mixed with 1 mL of potassium chlo - ride ( KCl ) isotonic solution ( 20 mM ) . The number of cells was 6 (cid:2) 7 × 10 7 per mL measured by a standard Neubauer count - ing chamber ( 0640030 , Marienﬁeld , Lauda - Konigshofen , Germany ) . Suspended yeast cells were kept frozen prior to use and thawed at 37 ° C for the experiment . Figure 4 shows dielectrophoretic manipulation of yeast cells obtained at dif - ferentappliedvoltagesandfrequencies . Withouttheexistence of electric ﬁelds , yeast cells are initially well dispersed near the bottom surface of the PDMS medium chamber , whereas when electric ﬁelds are applied , they are successfully collected and aligned on the PDMS layer surface at which the liquid electrode is located in the channel . As noted previously , the collection efﬁciency of the particles is a very important factor , which may be analyzed to evaluate the system performance . This study deﬁnes the collection efﬁciency of yeast cells as follows : (cid:10) c = (cid:4) 1 − n c n T (cid:5) × 100 ( 8 ) where n c and n T represent the number of collected cells and the cell number initially suspended in the medium cham - ber , respectively . As the applied voltage increases from 100 to 800 V , better collection of yeast cells is observed . The 100 kHz condition yields better cell collection compared to other frequencies at 800 V . This indicates a clear ef - fect of applied voltage and frequency on the particle collec - tion . Figure 5A shows the estimated collection efﬁciencies C (cid:3) 2014 WILEY - VCH Verlag GmbH & Co . KGaA , Weinheim www . electrophoresis - journal . com 6 H . R . Gwon et al . Electrophoresis 2014 , 00 , 1 – 8 Figure 4 . Dielectrophoretic manipulation of yeast cells obtained at different applied voltages and frequencies . of yeast cells with respect to applied voltages over 30 s for applied voltages in the range 100 to 800 V at the ﬁxed frequency of 100 kHz . The collection efﬁciency increases with the applied voltage because the DEP force is propor - tional to the square of the dissipated voltage as indicated in Eq . ( 1 ) . The maximum collection efﬁciency reached was (cid:2) 90 % . This result is comparable with results for existing cDEP techniques reported in the previous literature [ 34 ] . This demonstrates extremely high collection efﬁciency and im - proved cell mobility using a movable liquid electrode cDEP design . The frequency effect on the CM factor should be also considered . As shown in Eqs . ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , DEP force de - pends on the electric ﬁeld strength and the magnitude of the real part of the CM factor , which is related to the ex - erted frequency - dependent dielectric properties of particle and medium , as seen in Supporting Information Fig . 3 . As demonstrated in Fig . 5B , the dielectrophoretic velocity of cells was measured for operation between 1 kHz and 1 MHz at the ﬁxed AC apparent voltage of 800 V . To estimate the dielectrophoretic velocity of a cell , two digi - tal images captured at different times were used . The focal plane was ﬁxed on the PDMS thin layer because the yeast cells were distributed near the bottom surface owing to the gravitational effect . As shown , the dielectrophoretic velocity increases with frequency . The maximum value is 10 . 85 ± 0 . 95 (cid:2) m / s at 100 kHz compared with 0 . 58 ± 0 . 11 (cid:2) m / s mea - sured at 1 kHz . Measured dielectrophoretic velocities of this studyarecomparablewiththepreviousmeasurementforcon - ventional DEP [ 35 ] . This result is attributed to low dissipated voltage and the low value of the real part of the CM factor at 1 kHz . This result supports the idea that collection efﬁciency is closely associated with the dielectrophoretic velocity and is also dependent on the frequency .

Effect of applied E - ﬁeld strength and frequency at liquid electrode DEP on collection efﬁciency for yeast cells , ( A ) collec - tion efﬁciencies of yeast cells w . r . t input voltages and ( B ) dielec - trophoretic velocity of yeast cells with respect to frequency for 800 V input voltage . 4 Concluding remarks This study proposed a new movable liquid - drop electrode DEP technique and experimentally demonstrated the active manipulation of yeast cells . The equivalent complex permit - tivity and the CM factor of yeast cells were numerically an - alyzed by using the concentric shell model with respect to frequency to facilitate the selection of optimal operating con - ditions . The highest value of the real part of the CM factor was estimated as 0 . 91 at around 100 kHz . The present DEP system is advantageous owing to its ability to control the local position at which the particles could be collected by properly manipulating a liquid drop . The experimental data clearly indicated an effect of the applied frequency on the drop of applied voltage in a thin PDMS layer . The maximum dielec - tric dissipated voltage with the 30 - (cid:2) m thin PDMS layer was about 7 . 2 V at 100 kHz . High values of dissipated voltage on the surface were required to manipulate yeast cells with DEP . The dielectrophoretic velocities and collection efﬁcien - cies of yeast cells were estimated with respect to a voltages and frequencies . The maximum collection efﬁciency reached was approximately 90 % , indicating that the present system was well suited for particle collection . From the experimen - tal results , it was found that the most effective frequency for positive DEP of yeast was approximately 100 kHz , and the maximum dielectrophoretic velocity was about 10 . 85 ± 0 . 95 (cid:2) m / s at an applied voltage of 800 V . From the results , it was concluded that the new contactless DEP system would be useful for dynamic particle collection by using a movable liquid electrode .
