Intrinsic Capability of Budding Yeast Cofilin to Promote Turnover of Tropomyosin - Bound Actin Filaments Xiaoxue Fan , Skylar Martin - Brown , Laurence Florens , Rong Li * The Stowers Institute for Medical Research , Kansas City , Missouri , United States of America Abstract The ability of actin filaments to function in cell morphogenesis and motility is closely coupled to their dynamic properties . Yeast cells contain two prominent actin structures , cables and patches , both of which are rapidly assembled and disassembled . Although genetic studies have shown that rapid actin turnover in patches and cables depends on cofilin , how cofilin might control cable disassembly remains unclear , because tropomyosin , a component of actin cables , is thought to protect actin filaments against the depolymerizing activity of ADF / cofilin . We have identified cofilin as a yeast tropomyosin ( Tpm1 ) binding protein through Tpm1 affinity column and mass spectrometry . Using a variety of assays , we show that yeast cofilin can efficiently depolymerize and sever yeast actin filaments decorated with either Tpm1 or mouse tropomyosins TM1 and TM4 . Our results suggest that yeast cofilin has the intrinsic ability to promote actin cable turnover , and that the severing activity may rely on its ability to bind Tpm1 .

In yeast cells that undergo polarized growth , actin cables and patches are dynamically assembled near growth sites and are required for two different cellular functions : polarized transport and endocytosis , respectively [ 2 ] . Actin filaments ( F - actin ) in cables are nucleated by formins and decorated by tropomyosins , whereas those in patches are nucleated by the Arp2 / 3 complex and decorated with cofilin and other patch specific markers [ 3 ] . Known cable components , Tpm1 , Tpm2 , Sac6 , and Abp140 , stabilize and / or bundle actin filaments in vitro and in vivo [ 6 – 11 ] . The rapid turnover of actin patches has been shown to depend on cofilin [ 4 ] , and a recent study found that although cofilin was not detected along actin cables under normal conditions , rapid turnover of actin cables also requires cofilin [ 5 ] . Cofilin is a member of the ADF / cofilin family of low molecular weight actin - binding proteins . These proteins can bind to actin monomers ( G - actin ) and filaments and stimulate depolymerization and fragmentation of F - actin [ 12 ] . Every eukaryotic cell type examined to - date contains at least one member of the ADF / cofilin family , suggesting that cofilin performs a universally important function . Null mutations of cofilin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans are all lethal . Cofilin - mediated F - actin severing and turnover are thought to be critical for rapid remodeling of actin organization in response to external stimuli , and for recycling of G - actin to sustain actin polymerization during cellular or intra cellular motility processes [ 13 ] . Tropomyosin has long been known to protect actin filaments from the depolymerizing and severing actions of DNaseI [ 14 ] , ADF / cofilin [ 15 , 16 ] and gelsolin [ 17 ] . Tropomyosin is a long protein with two a - helical polypeptides that form a parallel coiled coil , which further associate through head - to - tail interactions to form a long polymer along the side of an actin filament [ 18 ] . Whereas yeast has two tropomyosins , Tpm1 and Tpm2 , vertebrates have 17 tropomyosin isoforms . In general , tropomy - osin inhibits the dissociation of actin subunits from the pointed end of an actin filament [ 19 , 20 ] , which makes actin filament stronger and less likely to bend or break [ 21 , 22 ] . Tropomyosin may also be a critical factor governing the spatial segregation of Arp2 / 3 - and formin - nucleated actin structures in the cell . Whereas tropomyosin prevents branching nucleation by Arp2 / 3 complex , possibly due to their overlapping binding sites on F - actin [ 23 ] , a recent study also suggests that tropomyosin actively facilitates assembly of actin filaments by formin protein [ 24 ] . In order to uncover the mechanism governing the disassembly of tropomyosin - bound actin filaments , we used a proteomics approach to identify tropomyosin - binding proteins and found cofilin to be a highly ranked tropomyosin binder . This led us to test if yeast cofilin can directly sever tropomyosin - decorated F - actin . Surprisingly , we found that the major yeast tropomyosin , Tpm1 , has little protective effect against cofilin in a variety of assays , however , a cofilin mutant unable to bind Tpm1 showed diminished ability to sever Tpm1 - bound F - actin . These results suggest that yeast cofilin is intrinsically capable of promoting the turnover of tropomyosin - bound F - actin in yeast . Results Because previous studies suggest that tropomyosin inhibits actin depolymerization by cofilin [ 15 ] , we hypothesized that additional PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 November 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 11 | e3641 Table 1 .

Yeast Cofilin binds Tpm1 . A ) Tpm1 binds directly to wild - type Cof1 and mutant Cof1 - 5 but not Cof1 - 22 . BSA beads were used as a control . Beads coated with Tpm1 were incubated with 50 nM Cof1 , Cof1 - 5 or Cof1 - 22 . Bound cofilin was visualized by immunoblotting using yeast cofilin antibody [ 39 ] . B ) Determination of dissociation constant K d between Cof1 and Tpm1 . Beads coated with 0 to 8 m M Tpm1 were incubated with 50 nM Cof1 . Bound cofilin was visualized as in ( A ) .

For this and subsequent experiments , we used recombinant Tpm1 purified from E . coli , which we found had similar F - actin - binding properties as Tpm1 purified from yeast cells ( data not shown ) . To minimize proteins that would associate with the Tpm1 affinity column via F - actin , yeast high - speed supernatant was prepared in G - actin buffer and indeed actin was not found among the bound proteins using Multidimensional Protein Identification Technolo - gy ( MudPIT ) . Surprisingly , Cof1 was reproducibly detected in two Tmp1 affinity experiments , but not the BSA control columns , and was ranked among the top ten proteins , based on frequency of detection and quantitative NSAF values ( Table 1 ) . To test if the association between Cof1 and Tpm1 was direct , we expressed and purified yeast Cof1 from E . coli and found that it binds to Tpm1 - coupled beads but not the control BSA beads ( Fig . 1A ) . Using a quantitative Cof1 pull - down assay [ 25 ] the apparent K d for Cof1 binding to Tpm1 was determined to be 3 . 34 6 0 . 12 m M ( Fig . 1B ) . Despite a weak affinity , this interaction is likely to be specific because it was abolished by the cof1 - 22 mutation , which was shown previously to inhibit turnover of actin patches and cables in vivo [ 4 , 5 ] , but not the cof1 - 5 mutation ( Fig . 1A ) . Neither mutation affected the folding stability of Cof1 [ 26 ] . The observation of a direct interaction between Cof1 and Tpm1 led us to test whether Cof1 impacts the stability of yeast F - actin decorated with Tpm1 using a co - sedimentation assay . Yeast actin , purified as described [ 27 ] , was polymerized in the presence of Tpm1 and then incubated with or without an equimolar or excess cofilin for 20 min . In the absence of Cof1 , Tpm1 co - sedimented with F - actin in the pellet fraction ( Fig . 2A ) . Upon incubation with Cof1 , most Tpm1 no longer sedimented in the pellet , but instead moved with F - actin to the supernatant fraction . Cof1 had a similar effect when incubated with yeast F - actin bound to either the mouse high - molecular - weight tropomyosin , TM1 , or low - molec - ular - weight tropomyosin , TM4 . The extents to which actin was solublized by cofilin were identical with or without tropomyosin bound . This is best observed in an experiment where increasing concentrations of Cof1 was used ( Fig . 2B ) . The two yeast cofilin mutants , Cof1 - 5 and Cof1 - 22 , showed a similar effect in this assay to that of wild - type Cof1 ( Fig . 3 ) . In contrast , mouse non - muscle cofilin 1 , which is more similar than mouse cofilin 2 to yeast cofilin , showed diminished ability to depolymerize muscle actin bound to TM1 ( Fig . 2C , E ) , TM4 or Tpm1 , as expected ( Table 2 ) . This result raised the question of whether tropomyosin could indeed protect F - actin against yeast cofilin . Because the above assay only assessed the steady - state distribution of F - versus G - actin , we next used two assays in Figure 2 . Yeast cofilin but not mouse cofilin 1 depolymerizes F - actin decorated with tropomyosin . A ) Yeast F - actin ( 10 m M ) polymerized with or without 10 m M tropomyosin was incubated with 0 , 10 or 20 m M Cof1 ( Tpm1 - containing sample ) , or with 0 or 10 m M Cof1 ( TM1 or TM4 - containing sample ) . The supernatants and pellets after ultracentrifugation ( see Materials and Methods ) were analyzed on an SDS - PAGE gel . B ) F - actin ( 10 m M ) polymerized with or without 10 m M Tpm1p was incubated with 0 , 2 . 5 , 5 , 10 , 20 and 40 m M Cof1 . Subsequent analysis was done as in ( A ) . C ) Rabbit muscle actin ( 10 m M ) polymerized with or without 10 m M TM1 was incubated with 0 , 5 , 10 , 20 and 40 m M mouse cofilin 1 . Subsequent analysis was done as in ( A ) . D , E ) Quantification by densitometry of actin in pellet fractions ( as % of the total actin ) from experiments in ( B ) and ( C ) , respectively . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0003641 . g002 Regulation of Actin Turnover PLoS ONE | www . plosone . org 3 November 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 11 | e3641 which pyrene - labeled F - actin was diluted ( see Materials and Methods ) to determine the effect of Cof1 on the kinetics of actin depolymerization with or without bound tropomyosin . Light scattering showed that Cof1 drastically increased the rate of F - actin depolymerization after dilution , and Tpm1 binding to F - actin had no effect on the Cof1 - induced actin depolymerization ( Fig . 4A ) . Interestingly , measurements of pyrene actin fluorescence in these experiments suggest that binding of Cof1 to F - actin , as indicated by fluorescence quenching [ 28 ] , was not affected by the presence of Tpm1 ( Fig . 4B ) , On the other hand , mouse tropomyosin 1 reduced the binding of mouse cofilin 1 to F - actin ( Fig . 4C ) , which is consistent with competitive binding of tropomyosin and cofilin to F - actin , as demonstrated by previous studies [ 16 ] . Cof1 - 22 exhibited reduced ability to promote depolymerization of naked actin compared to wild - type Cof1 , confirming a previous report [ 4 ] , yet again , Tpm1 did not alter the depolymerization kinetics in the presence of Cof1 - 22 ( Fig . 4A ) . Cofilin possesses both actin depolymerization and severing activities , and the latter requires much lower concentrations of cofilin than the former [ 29 ] . We used a microscopy - based assay to test the effect of Tpm1 on actin severing by substoichiometric amounts of Cof1 ( see Materials and Methods ) . Pre - polymerized yeast actin was incubated with Cof1 for various lengths of time . The reactions were stopped by dilution into a buffer containing Alexa488 - phalloidin , and the lengths of F - actin were quantified using fluorescence microscopy . Under our experimental condi - tions , Tpm1 increased the average F - actin length from 9 . 81 6 4 . 56 m m to 15 . 6 6 3 . 45 m m ( . 100 filaments measured ) . After addition of 50 nM cofilin to 5 m M F - actin , the average F - actin length decreased rapidly in the presence or absence of Tpm1 ( Fig . 5A ) . Even though Tpm1 - bound filaments started longer , the rate of filament severing by Cof1 was similar with or without Tpm1 bound to F - actin . Cof1 - 5 exhibited an only slightly reduced rate of actin severing , which was not affected by Tpm1 binding ( Fig . 5B , C ) . Interestingly , Cof1 - 22 only exhibited a moderate defect severing naked F - actin , however , the severing defect was much more enhanced toward Tpm1 - bound F - actin , and long filaments were observable even after 40 min of incubation with Cof1 - 22 ( Fig . 5B , C , D ) . Discussion Tropomyosin - containing actin structures carry out many important functions such as cellular contractility , motility and polarized transport [ 18 ] . Current thinking on the turnover of tropomyosin - decorated actin structures is influenced by the notion that tropomyosin protects F - actin from the depolymerizing activity of ADF / cofilin . The data presented above show that tropomyosin does not present a barrier for the action of yeast cofilin , suggesting that Cof1 may be intrinsically capable of mediating the turnover of actin cables . This is consistent with the recent observation of a Figure 3 . Yeast Cof1 mutants Cof1 - 5 and Cof1 - 22 can depolymerize F - actin with or without tropomyosin bound . A , B , C ) F - actin ( 10 m M ) polymerized without Tpm1p was incubated with 0 , 10 , 20 m M Cof1 , Cof1 - 5 and Cof1 - 22 respectively and with 10 m M Tpm1p was incubated with 0 , 2 . 5 , 5 , 10 and 20 m M Cof1 , Cof1 - 5 and Cof1 - 22 respectively . The supernatants and pellets after ultracentrifu - gation ( see Materials and Methods ) were analyzed on an SDS - PAGE gel .

The protective effect of tropomyosin against vertebrate ADF / cofilin is thought to be due to competitive binding of tropomyosin and ADF / cofilin to F - actin . We found surprisingly that Cof1 was associated as a high - scoring binder to Tpm1 affinity column , and that purified Cof1 binds directly to tropomyosin in solution . Although the affinity of this interaction is low in solution , it may occur more extensively on the surface of actin cables where there is a high local concentration of tropomyosin . The interaction between Cof1 and Tpm1 is abolished by cof1 - 22 , which encompasses three amino acid substitutions : E134A , R135A , R138A [ 26 ] . These mutations were previously shown to reduce the binding of Cof1 to F - actin , and recent structural analysis placed these residues at the F - actin binding interface [ 30 ] . Based on these findings , we speculate that whereas the presence of Tpm1 may hinder Cof1’s contacts with F - actin , some of these contacts may be replaced by the interaction between Tpm1 and Cof1 . The latter could either alter the association of Tpm1 with F - actin or could help stabilize the overall interaction of Cof1 with F - actin in order to cause the structural changes in the filament that lead to fragmentation [ 31 ] . A previous study found that cof1 - 22 also reduces the rate of actin patch turnover , and the extent of this reduction parallels the effect of the mutations on Cof1 - induced actin depolymerization in vitro [ 4 ] . This is consistent with the high local concentration of Cof1 in actin patches and a specific requirement for Cof1 in the turnover of ADP - actin filaments during the endocytic process [ 32 ] . The effect of cof1 - 22 on the rate of cable turnover , reported recently , appears much more dramatic than that on actin patches [ 5 ] , and this correlates with the strong defect of the mutant cofilin in severing tropomyosin - decorated actin filaments observed in this study . These observations , together with a lack of localization of Cof1 along actin cables , may suggest that Cof1 promotes cable turnover primarily through its severing activity . Multicellular organisms express many isoforms of ADF / cofilin and tropomyosin due to gene duplication and alternative splicing [ 13 , 18 ] . Even though some tropomyosin isoforms have been shown to antagonize the activity of ADF / cofilin , certain isoforms appear to actively recruit ADF / cofilin to highly dynamic actin structures [ 18 ] . Thus our results further support the view that cofilin and tropomyosin can collaborate in the regulation of rapid actin turnover . Materials and Methods Protein expression and purification Genes encoding S . cerevisiae TPM1 , COF1 , mouse tropomyosin 1 ( TM1 ) and 4 ( TM4 ) , and non - muscle cofilin 1 were amplified from yeast genomic DNA and mouse kidney cDNA library , respectively , and subcloned into pGEX - 6P - 1 vector ( GE Healthcare ) and expressed in E . coli BL21 cells as a glutathione S - transferense ( GST ) fusion proteins . Mutations corresponding to cof1 - 5 and cof1 - 22 [ 26 ] were introduced to Cof1 expression plasmid by site - directed mutagenesis . Recombinant proteins were cleaved from GST by PreScission protease and purified by passing through Figure 4 .

These yeast whole extracts were then loaded onto Tpm1 - beads for over three hours and the column was washed overnight with HEK buffer . The specific Tpm1 binding proteins were eluted using different buffers : 0 . 5 M KCl or 3 M urea in HEK buffer . Negative controls using BSA - conjugated columns were also performed in parallel and proteins were eluted in 0 . 5 M KCl in HEK buffer or 3 M Urea in HEK buffer . TCA - precipitated proteins were urea - denatured , reduced , alkylated and digested with endoproteinase Lys - C ( Roche ) followed by modified trypsin ( Roche ) as described [ 35 ] . Peptide mixtures were loaded onto 100 m m fused silica microcapillary columns and placed in - line with a quaternary Agilent 1100 series HPLC pump and LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometers ( ThermoScientific ) . Fully automated 10 - step MudPIT runs were carried out on the electrosprayed peptides , as described in reference [ 35 ] . Tandem mass ( MS / MS ) spectra were interpreted using SEQUEST [ 36 ] against a database of 11982 amino acid sequences , consisting of 5815 Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins ( non - redundant entries from NCBI 2007 - 03 - 12 release ) , 176 usual contaminants such as human keratins , IgGs , and proteolytic enzymes ; and , to estimate false discovery rates ( FDR ) , 5991 randomized sequences for each non - redundant protein entry . Peptide / spectrum matches were sorted and selected using DTASelect [ 37 ] and peptide hits from multiple runs were compared using CONTRAST [ 37 ] . Under the selection criteria we applied , FDR at the protein level was 1 . 85 % , while the average spectral FDR was 0 . 4 % . To estimate relative protein levels , Normalized Spectral Abundance Factors ( NSAFs ) were calculated for each detected protein , as described [ 38 ] . Determining the binding affinity between Tpm1 and Cof1 K d determinations by Tpm1 - Gel 10 pull - down of purified Cof1 were performed as described [ 25 ] . Briefly Tpm1 - coated Affi - Gel beads ( 0 – 8 m M ) were incubated with 50 nM purified Cof1 and 2 mg / ml bovine serum albumin . The samples were incubated for 1 hr at 4 u C with agitation . Supernatants were collected by low speed centrifugation . Beads were washed four times in 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , and 1 mM DTT with 1 % Nonidet P - 40 . Free and bound fractions were detected by Western blotting for anti - Cof1 [ 39 ] , after resolving the proteins by SDS - PAGE . The bands were quantified using ImageQuant software ( Amersham Biosciences ) . The data were plotted and fitted with a single rectangular hyperbola equation : B = B max C / ( K d + C ) using SigmaPlot software ( Systat Software , Inc . ) . Actin cosedimentation assays Yeast actin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin were purified using previously described procedures [ 27 , 40 ] . The purified yeast or rabbit muscle actin ( 10 m M ) was polymerized by adding 50 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 0 . 5 mM ATP in G - buffer for 2 hr at room temperature with or without 10 m M tropomyosins . Yeast Cof1 or mouse cofilin1 was incubated at specified concentrations with polymerized actin for 20 min at room temperature . The samples were centrifuged in a Beckman Optima TLX ultracen - trifuge at 900 , 000 rpm for 20 min . The pellets were dissolved by protein gel loading buffer at an equal volume as the supernatant . The same volume of supernatants and pellets were analyzed by SDS - PAGE . Actin depolymerization assays Yeast actin 5 m M was co - polymerized with 8 % pyrene - labeled rabbit muscle actin at 25 u C for 2 hr in F - buffer . F - actin and cofilins were mixed in a cuvette to final concentrations of 0 . 5 m M , and the decrease in pyrene fluorescence was monitored at 25 u C in a fluorescence spectrophotometer ( Photon Technology Interna - tional ) with an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and emission of 407 nm . In light - scattering assay , the depolymerization of F - actin was monitored at 25 u C with both the excitation and emission wavelengths of 400 nm . Quantification of actin filament length by confocal imaging Yeast actin of 5 m M was polymerized with or without 5 m M tropomyosin overnight at 4 u C . Purified 50 nM Cof1 was added to and incubated with the preassembled F - actin for various lengths of time and then diluted and stained by Alexa - fluor 488 phalloidin . Actin filaments were imaged on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M with a Yokogawa spinning disc confocal microscope using a 100X DIC oil - immersion objective . Image acquisition was performed using a Hamamatsu EM - CCD camera . Actin filament lengths were quantified using the Metamorph image software .
