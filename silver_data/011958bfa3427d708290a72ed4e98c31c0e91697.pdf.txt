We demonstrated that porcine coﬁlin severs actin ﬁlaments and accelerates monomer release at the pointed ends . At pH 7 . 1 , 0 . 8 μ M coﬁlin cut ﬁlaments ( 2 . 2 μ M actin ) about every 290 subunits and increased the depolymerization rate 6 . 4 - fold . A kink in the major α - helix of coﬁlin is thought to constitute a contact site for actin . Side chain hydroxyl groups of Ser119 , Ser120 and Tyr82 in coﬁlin form hydrogen bonds with main chain carbonyl moieties from the helix , causing the kink . We eliminated side chain hydroxyls by Ser → Ala and / or Tyr → Phe mutagenesis . Severing and depolymerization - enhancing activities were reduced dramatically in an Ala120 mutant , whereas the latter was decreased in a Phe82 mutant with a relatively small effect on severing , suggesting different structural bases for the two activities of coﬁlin . The Ala120 - equivalent mutation in yeast coﬁlin affected cell growth , whereas that of the Phe82 - equivalent had no effect in yeast . These results indicate the physiological signiﬁcance of the severing activity of coﬁlin that is brought about by the kink in the helix . Keywords : actin / coﬁlin / mutation / tertiary structure / yeast Introduction Coﬁlin ( or ADF ) is a low molecular weight actin - regulating protein that is ubiquitous among eukaryotes . Coﬁlin func - tions in cytokinesis , endocytosis and various other motile processes involving actin dynamics ( Abe et al . , 1996 ; Aizawa et al . , 1996 ; Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ; Rosenblatt et al . , 1997 ) . The strict necessity for coﬁlin for viability in yeast , slime mould , nematode and fruit ﬂy indicates its biological importance ( Iida et al . , 1993 ; Moon et al . , 1993 ; McKim et al . , 1994 ; Aizawa et al . , 1995 ; Gunsalus et al . , 1995 ) . The biochemical activities responsible for its essential biological role , however , have remained controversial . Because subunits are exchanged exclusively at the ends of actin ﬁlaments , the dynamics of uncapped ﬁlaments should be enhanced by accelerating subunit ﬂux in the ﬁlaments ( treadmill ) , and / or by ﬁlament fragmentation to increase the number of ﬁlament ends ( severing ) . Either event should augment the rate of subunit exchange between F - actin and the monomeric actin pool , resulting in enhanced actin dynamics . Evidence has been presented for both treadmill and severing mechanisms with respect to coﬁlin . Classical 6752 © European Molecular Biology Organization studies have regarded enhanced rates of elongation and disassembly of uncapped F - actin as evidence of fragmenta - tion , and this interpretation has been applied to coﬁlin action ( Nishida et al . , 1985 ; Maciver et al . , 1991 ; Moon et al . , 1993 ) . However , Carlier and her associates argued that all the effects of coﬁlin could be attributed to the treadmill model , and refuted the notion of actin - severing activity ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ) . Several recent reports have also supported the treadmill model ( Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ; Rosenblatt et al . , 1997 ) . In this study , we critically examined both models of coﬁlin action on actin . The three - dimensional structures of coﬁlin and its homologues have notable features . The tertiary structure of coﬁlin is strikingly similar to segments of gelsolin , an actin - severing / capping protein , although the primary structure has no signiﬁcant homology ( Hatanaka et al . , 1996 ; Fedorov et al . , 1997 ; Leonard et al . , 1997 ) . Like gelsolin segment 1 , coﬁlin is thought to use a long helix to make immediate contact with actin . This view is supported by biochemical data ( Yonezawa et al . , 1989 , 1991 ; Moriyama et al . , 1992 ; Wriggers et al . , 1998 ) . The actin - binding helix of coﬁlin is kinked around the middle , whereas no irregularity is apparent in gelsolin segment 1 ( McLaughlin et al . , 1993 ) . Thus , the kink in the structure of coﬁlin may have functional signiﬁcance . Possible causes of the irregular fold in the coﬁlin helix have been indicated by two X - ray crystallographic studies ( Fedorov et al . , 1997 ; Leonard et al . , 1997 ) and our NMR data ( H . Hatanaka and K . Moriyama , unpublished works ) . The results of these studies suggest that three side chain to main chain hydrogen bonds interrupt the normal α - helix fold through disrupting intra - backbone hydrogen bonding . Since the side chain proton donors could be hydroxyl moieties of Ser119 , Ser120 and Tyr82 in mammalian coﬁlin , we created porcine coﬁlin mutants in which these amino acids were replaced by Ala119 , Ala120 and Phe82 , respectively , then determined the functional signiﬁcance of the triad of hydrogen bonds . Results Coﬁlin severs actin ﬁlaments The rate of F - actin depolymerization is measured conven - tionally by initiating its disassembly by dilution or by adding avid actin monomer - sequestering proteins . The amount of residual F - actin is then determined spectro - photometrically as a function of time , and the rate of depolymerization is calculated ( Walsh et al . , 1984 ; Maciver et al . , 1991 ; Weber et al . , 1994 ) . To determine both the severing and disassembly of F - actin simultaneously as a function of time , we modiﬁed this method as follows . We assumed that the depolymerization rate of F - actin depends on the dissociation rate from the pointed end and the number of free pointed ends . We examined whether or Activities of coﬁlin not these two parameters are altered depending on the concentration of porcine coﬁlin . When actin is polymerized in the presence of a limited amount of gelsolin , the concentration ( number per unit volume ) of the resulting ﬁlaments is almost equal to that of gelsolin , because the ﬁlaments are nucleated exclusively by gelsolin ( Bryan and Coluccio , 1985 ; Janmey et al . , 1986 ; Weber et al . , 1994 ) . Gelsolin - capped ﬁlaments were incubated with coﬁlin in the presence of gelsolin – actin dimers . The binary complexes were added simultaneously with coﬁlin , so as to cap newly formed free barbed ends . F - actin depolymerization was then initiated by vitamin D - binding protein ( DBP ) , a potent actin monomer - sequestering protein . The rate of disassem - bly at pointed ends was estimated from time - dependent depolymerization . When the initial rate is plotted versus the initial concentration of gelsolin , the slope of a linear regression line represents an off - rate constant at the pointed end and the intercept on the abscissa represents an alteration in the ﬁlament number per unit volume . Thus , a negative intercept value indicates that coﬁlin severs F - actin to increase the ﬁlament concentration . However , the binding of coﬁlin to F - actin itself signi - ﬁcantly increases light scattering and the turbidity of the solution , and it also partially quenches ﬂuorescence of the pyrene attached to actin in the polymer ( Nishida et al . , 1984 ; Carlier et al . , 1997 ) . To circumvent these difﬁculties , we initiated F - actin depolymerization when a new steady - state of the F - actin solution regarding pyrene ﬂuorescence was achieved after adding coﬁlin ( Figure 1A ) . The amount of unpolymerized actin at the new steady - state was deter - mined by a DNase I inhibition assay and the amount of F - actin per ﬂuorescence unit was calculated for each reaction with coﬁlin . According to this protocol , the decrease in the ﬂuorescence intensity closely approximates the amount of depolymerized actin , within the range of coﬁlin concentrations used in the experiments shown in Figure 1 . Pyrene ﬂuorescence was quenched maximally at 8 . 7 % in the presence of 0 . 8 μ M His 6 - tagged coﬁlin . We ﬁrst calibrated the time of pre - incubation with coﬁlin prior to DBP addition , because whether severing of F - actin by coﬁlin is fast or slow ( and catalytic or stoichiometric ) was unknown . One example is shown in Figure 1B , in which the rate constant was plotted against the pre - incubation time when 16 . 3 nM gelsolin - nucleated ﬁlaments were reacted with 0 . 3 μ M coﬁlin . The rate constants were derived from the DBP - induced disassembly traces assuming exponential kinetics . We found that the rate constant slowly increased initially , suggesting an increase in the number of ﬁlament ends due to severing . However , the increase ceased within 10 min , irrespective of the amount of coﬁlin ( 0 . 1 – 0 . 8 μ M ) . This suggests that coﬁlin severs F - actin in a ‘slow and stoichiometric’ fashion and not catalytically . Based on these results , we set 10 min as the pre - incubation time and measured all the severing events during this period . Traces of DBP - induced ﬂuorescence changes are shown in Figure 1C for F - actin reacted beforehand with 0 . 8 μ M wild - type coﬁlin . The rate constants for the depolymeriza - tion reactions were calculated by applying exponential curve ﬁts , because they closely followed exponential kinetics ( Figure 1D ) . We then plotted calculated off - rates ( at time (cid:2) 0 ) versus initial concentrations of gelsolin 6753 ( number of ﬁlaments ) ( Figure 1E ) . The results show that coﬁlin increased both the slope and the number of ﬁlament ends , suggesting that coﬁlin severs ﬁlaments and accelerates subunit dissociation from the pointed end . Similar experiments were performed using 0 . 1 , 0 . 3 and 0 . 5 μ M coﬁlin . From these data , we calculated a frequency of one cut per 290 actin subunits and a 6 . 4 - fold increase in the dissociation rate constant at pointed ends in the presence of 0 . 8 μ M coﬁlin . To obtain more evidence of severing , we observed ﬂuor - escently labelled F - actin under an epiﬂuorescence micro - scope after reaction with coﬁlin within 1 min ( Figure 2 ) . The results showed that coﬁlin shortened ﬁlaments and increased the number of them in a concentration - dependent manner ( Figure 2 ) . This suggests that coﬁlin severed Alexa - labelled F - actin . It is unlikely that the increased number of ﬁlaments can be ascribed to depolymerization and repoly - merization rather than to fragmentation of the ﬁlaments , because we observed little assembly of monomeric Mg - actin ( 40 % Alexa - labelled ) in the presence of coﬁlin under the same conditions . However , this system required a higher concentration of coﬁlin than the DBP - induced depolymerization assay to produce signiﬁcant effects . The difference in the effective concentrations between the two methods may be attributed to the different duration of reac - tion with coﬁlin . In addition , F - actin was not capped for the microscopy experiment , whereas gelsolin - capped F - actin was used in the other assay . Despite these differences , both methods demonstrated the actual severing by coﬁlin . The role of a triad of hydrogen bonds in the actin - binding helix of coﬁlin To examine the functional signiﬁcance of the triad of hydrogen bonds around the longest α - helix of coﬁlin , we replaced Tyr82 , Ser119 and Ser120 of porcine coﬁlin with Phe , Ala and Ala , respectively , to eliminate the side chain hydroxyl groups that constitute the proton donors of the triad . Double or triple mutations consisting of these single substitutions were also examined . All the mutant proteins were produced by Escherichia coli as C - terminally His 6 - tagged proteins . We initially examined the ability of the mutants to bind G - actin ( Figure 3 ) . Actin complexed with theHis 6 - taggedwild - typeandmutantcoﬁlinboundtoNi 2 (cid:3) – resin . Actin was strictly maintained in a monomeric state by a prior incubation with pancreatic DNase I , an avid actin - sequestering protein that does not interfere with actin binding to coﬁlin . The results indicated that the afﬁnity of coﬁlin for G - actin was greatly reduced when Ala was substituted for Ser120 of coﬁlin . Replacing Tyr82 with Phe slightly weakened the binding , while substituting Ser119 by Ala had no effect . A combination of two or three of these mutations notably affected the afﬁnity . Coﬁlin binds to F - actin stoichiometrically and depolymerizes F - actin in a pH - dependent fashion . We determined these activities of the mutants by examining their co - sedimentation with F - actin at two pH values ( Figure 4 ) . The co - sedimentation proﬁle of mutant A119 was indistinguishable from that of wild - type coﬁlin , indicating that the substitution of Ser119 did not affect the activity of coﬁlin on F - actin . Mutant F82 depolymerized F - actin less efﬁciently , but co - sedimented with F - actin as efﬁciently as wild - type coﬁlin . Taken together with the results shown in Figure 3 , the substitution of Tyr82 may K . Moriyama and I . Yahara 6754 have reduced the afﬁnity of coﬁlin for monomeric actin , but not for F - actin . Binding to F - actin and the depolymerization activity of mutant A120 were both signiﬁcantly reduced . We next examined whether or not these mutations affect the severing of actin ﬁlaments and the acceleration of monomer release from their pointed ends . The results indicated that like the wild type , mutant A119 increased the number of ﬁlaments ( Figure 5B and E ) and also accelerated ﬁlament disassembly from the pointed end ( Figure 5B and D ) . The acceleration rate caused by mutant F82 was , how - ever , muchslowerthanthatofthewild - typecoﬁlinormutant A119 ( Figure 5A and D ) , which was consistent with its weaker depolymerizing activity ( Figure 4 ) . The number of ﬁlaments increased with mutant F82 , although the extent was moderately reduced ( Figure 5A and E ) . In contrast , mutant A120 ( up to 3 . 6 μ M ) did not signiﬁcantly increase the number of ﬁlaments , indicating that this mutant had little ability to sever F - actin ( Figure 5C and E ) . The results alsoshowedthatthismutantweaklyenhancedthedisassem - bly rate ( Figure 5C and D ) . Consistent results for severing were obtained by direct observation of ﬂuorescent F - actin incubatedwiththemutantsunder themicroscope ( Figure2 ) . Mutant A119 increased the number of ﬁlaments almost as efﬁciently as wild - type coﬁlin , and mutant F82 produced a moderate increase . However , mutant A120 did not sever F - actin appreciably . We examined the ability of mutant coﬁlin to reduce the Fig . 1 . Coﬁlin increases both the number of pointed ends and the rate of depolymerization from pointed ends of gelsolin - capped actin ﬁlaments . ( A ) Schematic representation of the assay to measure the rate of monomer dissociation at the pointed ends in the presence of coﬁlin . After gelsolin - capped actin ﬁlaments ( 5 % pyrene - labelled ) were reacted with coﬁlin for a certain period in the presence of gelsolin – actin dimers , DBP was added and decreasing ﬂuorescence was recorded . ( B ) Dependence of the rate constant for the ﬂuorescence decline on the period of pre - incubation with 0 . 3 μ M His 6 - tagged coﬁlin . The pre - incubation period was varied from 0 to 30 min using 16 . 3 nM gelsolin - capped ﬁlaments ( 3 . 3 μ M total actin ) , then the rate constant for the ﬂuorescence decrease was calculated and plotted as a function of the pre - incubation time ( u ) . The ﬂuorescence intensity at the time of DBP addition ( s ) and the calculated rate of initial ﬂuorescence decrease ( d ) are also plotted . All three parameters plateaued within 10 min at least in the presence of 0 . 1 – 0 . 8 μ M His 6 - tagged coﬁlin . ( C ) Raw data showing ﬂuorescence decline of F - actin ( 5 % pyrene - labelled ) after DBP addition . Pyrene – actin was mixed with various concentrations of gelsolin and fully polymerized . After incubation with coﬁlin for 10 min in the presence of gelsolin – actin dimers , depolymerization was initiated by adding DBP . The initial amount of gelsolin used to construct deﬁned numbers of actin ﬁlaments is speciﬁed on the graph as the concentration in the ﬁnal reaction mixture . Final concentrations of coﬁlin and actin were 0 . 8 and 3 . 3 μ M , respectively . ( D ) Simulation of the DBP - induced depolymerization processes by adopting exponential kinetics . The end point ﬂuorescence intensity was subtracted from each trace of the ﬂuorescence decrease displayed in ( C ) and the normalized traces were redrawn on a semi - logarithmic scale ( - - - - ) and ﬁtted computationally by exponential curves ( —— ) .

( E ) Calculated rates of DBP - induced depolymerization plotted as a function of the gelsolin concentration shown in ( C ) . A linear regression ﬁt was applied to each plot . The amount of F - actin at the time of DBP addition was determined as the difference between total actin and actin monomer measured by DNase I inhibition assay . The off - rate ( at time (cid:2) 0 ) was calculated from the rate constant for the ﬂuorescence decline and the amount of F - actin at the time of DBP addition . The amount of His 6 - tagged coﬁlin is speciﬁed as the concentration in the ﬁnal reaction mixture . The plot of a mock reaction without coﬁlin is shown as n . Mean values of F - actin concentration at the time of DBP addition were 2 . 82 , 2 . 56 , 2 . 49 , 2 . 34 and 2 . 23 μ M when coﬁlin was added at 0 , 0 . 1 , 0 . 3 , 0 . 5 and 0 . 8 μ M , respectively .

F82A119 has both F82 and A119 substitutions . F82A120 and F82SAA are designated accordingly . viscosity of F - actin solution . Figure 6 shows that mutant A119 reduced the viscosity as efﬁciently as wild - type coﬁlin . Mutants F82 and F82A119 also reduced viscosity , 6755 but the effective concentrations of these mutants were double that of the wild type . Replacing Ser120 with alanine severely affected this activity . These results are consistent with those of the severing assays presented in Figures 2 and 5 . In vivo effects of mutations A119 , F82 and A120 We examined whether or not these mutations affect the biological function of coﬁlin in living cells . Since coﬁlin is indispensable for the survival of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Iida et al . , 1993 ; Moon et al . , 1993 ) , we examined the effects of these mutations on the ability of coﬁlin to support the growth of yeast cells . Porcine coﬁlin , when expressed by a multicopy plasmid , supports the growth or colony formation of a yeast strain with its COF1 gene deleted ( Figure 7A ; Iida et al . , 1993 ; Moriyama et al . , 1996 ) . The F82 and A119 mutants preserved this ability at all temperatures tested ( Figure 7A ) . In contrast , the A120 mutant grew more slowly at 25°C , and was unable to form colonies at higher temperatures ( Figure 7A ) . This did not seem to be caused by reduced structural stability of the A120 protein because the mutant protein was not hypersensitive to unfolding by urea compared with wild - type and other mutant proteins ( Figure 8 ) . In addition , the A120 protein was not liable to degradation in yeast cells because the expression level of A120 was 4 - fold higher than that of wild - type proteins ( data not shown ) . In yeast coﬁlin , Tyr64 corresponds to Tyr82 of porcine coﬁlin , and Ser103 and Ser104 to Ser119 and Ser120 of porcine coﬁlin , respectively . We created a set of mutants of the yeast coﬁlin gene , COF1 , corresponding to that of the K . Moriyama and I . Yahara Fig . 4 . Ability of coﬁlin mutants to co - sediment with and depolymerize F - actin . Actin ( 4 . 5 μ M ) was polymerized and reacted with 9 . 0 μ M His 6 - tagged coﬁlin or its mutant for 75 min . F - actin and bound recombinant proteins were sedimented by centrifugation , then supernatant and sediment were resolved by SDS – PAGE . Pairs of upper and middle panels show the results at pH 7 . 0 and 8 . 3 , respectively . See legend to Figure 3 for mutant designations . The amount of actin and coﬁlin in the sedimented fraction was quantiﬁed and is shown in the lower panel as a bar graph . pig counterpart . We again examined the ability of these mutantstocomplementthedeletionof COF1 . Acentromere , instead of a multicopy , plasmid was used to express the cof1 mutant genes . The results showed that all the mutants were viable and that colony size did not differ from that of the wild type under normal growth conditions at 25°C . Mutants carrying the A104 substitution , however , exhibited a tem - perature - sensitive growth phenotype , as they formed only tiny colonies above 37 . 5°C ( Figure 7B ) . Thus , conditional growth defects were caused by the A120 substitution of porcinecoﬁlin ora homologousmutation inyeast COF1 . As characterized above , the A120 mutation impaired severing activity signiﬁcantly more than it could accelerate directed depolymerization at the pointed end of F - actin , whereas the F82 mutation considerably reduced the latter activity with a smaller effect on severing . The F82 substitution of porcine coﬁlin or a homologous substitution in yeast COF1 had no apparent adverse effect on yeast growth . These results suggest that ﬁlament - severing activity is at least important for coﬁlin to sustain yeast growth . The activity of coﬁlin in enhancing directed depolymerization may also play a physiological role in cooperation with its severing activity . 6756 Discussion Dual functions of coﬁlin Whether or not coﬁlin severs F - actin has been controversial since Carlier et al . ( 1997 ) claimed that coﬁlin / ADF does not sever , but exclusively accelerates the treadmilling of F - actin . We describe here an improved method to measure fragmentation and the dissociation rate constant at the pointed end of F - actin in the presence of a substoichio - metric amount of coﬁlin . When the barbed end of F - actin is capped , total disassembly must depend on the off - rate at the pointed end and the number of ﬁlaments per unit volume . The latter must be increased by severing events , if they occur , with coﬁlin . A relatively rapid quenching phase was noteasilyseparatedfromadepolymerizationphaseifcoﬁlinandDBPwereaddedsimultaneouslytopyrene - labelled F - actin . In addition , our calibration predicted a stoichio - metric ( non - catalytic ) nature of ﬁlament severing by coﬁlin , which apparently ceased within 10 min . We therefore initiated DBP - induced depolymerization after a 10 min incubation with coﬁlin , during which the level of ﬂuores - cence reduction reached a plateau . The kinetics of DBP - induced depolymerization processes was also consistent with the non - catalytic model of severing by coﬁlin . F - actin depolymerization follows exponential kinetics if the ﬁla - mentlengthdistributionisexponential . Thisistrueforeither spontaneously polymerized or gelsolin - nucleated ﬁlaments ( Kawamura and Maruyama , 1972 ; Bryan and Coluccio , 1985 ; Janmey et al . , 1986 ) . If fragmentation of the ﬁlaments continuesduring theDBP - induced depolymerizationphase , a semilog plot of depolymerization could give a downward curvature according to gradual increases in the number of ﬁlament ends . In practice , a large part of the depolymeriza - tion plot agreed with an exponential curve in the presence or absence of coﬁlin . We observed a negligible downward curvature even in the presence of 0 . 8 μ M coﬁlin ( the highest concentration used in this assay ; Figure 1D ) . This suggested little recurrent severing during induced depolymerization . Other reports also suggest a non - catalytic nature of severing by coﬁlin / ADF family proteins ( Hayden et al . , 1993 ; Maciver et al . , 1998 ; Blanchoin and Pollard , 1999 ) . Carlier et al . ( 1997 ) demonstrated that ADF accelerates depolymerization from pointed ends of actin ﬁlaments as much as 22 - fold . The results obtained with wild - type coﬁlin showninFigure 1Eindicatethatcoﬁlinatsubstoichiometric doses also accelerates their disassembly at the pointed end . However , we could only observe up to a 6 . 4 - fold increase , since the methodology restricted the use of higher coﬁlin doses . Anotherpotential problemis relatedto a recentreport arguing that gelsolin - capped , short ﬁlaments are resistant to severing by coﬁlin / ADF family proteins ( Maciver et al . , 1998 ) . If gelsolin - capped , shorter ﬁlaments are less susceptible to severing by coﬁlin , we might have over - estimated the severing efﬁciency and underestimated the dissociation rate constant at the pointed end . However , Maciver et al . ( 1998 ) used as much as 5 % gelsolin / actin for preparing gelsolin - capped ﬁlaments , whereas we used only 0 . 24 – 0 . 99 % gelsolin / actin . In addition , most of our plots of off - rate versus gelsolin ( Figures 1E and 5A – C ) show little trend of convexity , which would be expected if gelsolin - capped , shorter ﬁlaments were more resistant to severing by coﬁlin . Hence , our measurements of the two parameters are reasonably valid at least at this lower ratio of gelsolin / Activities of coﬁlin 6757 actin and at relatively low concentrations of coﬁlin . Future improvements to the method would allow similar analyses for higher coﬁlin concentrations . Didry et al . ( 1998 ) demonstrated that the number of ﬁlaments increased in the presence of plant ADF . However , they argued that this was due to a readjustment of the ﬁlament length distribution , caused by enhanced F - actin turnover , and that it was unlikely to be a result of severing . If this was true , the increase in ﬁlaments could be paralleled by the acceleration of depolymerization at the pointed ends . In contrast , we found little correlation between these two activities in the coﬁlin mutants F82 and A120 ( Figure 5D and E ) . Hence , most of the observed increases in the number of ﬁlaments must be the result of severing . Structural and functional roles for a triad of hydrogen bonds in coﬁlin While coﬁlin and gelsolin have quite distinct primary struc - tures , unitary segments of gelsolin are similar to coﬁlin in tertiary structure ( Hatanaka et al . , 1996 ; Fedorov et al . , 1997 ; Leonard et al . , 1997 ) . The actin - binding sites of coﬁlin have been mapped to / around its longest helix , and the corresponding helix of the ﬁrst segment of gelsolin also Fig . 6 .

Thus , coﬁlin may assume a tertiary structure similar to that of the ﬁrst or fourth segment of gelsolin when bound to actin . Despite this similarity , their modes of interaction with actin differ . For instance , segment 1 caps F - actin , whereas coﬁlin does not . Coﬁlin binds along F - actin then severs it , whereas segment 1 does not . Considering the structural differences , the long helix of coﬁlin is markedly kinked in contrast to those of the actin - binding segments of gelsolin . Although segments 3 and 6 of gelsolin have kinked helices , they are not thought to bind actin directly ( Burtnick 6758 et al . , 1997 ; McGough et al . , 1998 ) . The triad of hydrogen bonds on the actin - binding helix of coﬁlin must contribute to the formation of the kink , prompting an investigation of their functional signiﬁcance . This study revealed a central role for the hydrogen bond between the backbone carbonyl of Ile116 and the side chain hydroxyl of Ser120 located at the centre of the triad in porcine coﬁlin . Replacement of Ser120 with alanine signiﬁcantly reduced its severing activity . The same mutation also weakened the ability of coﬁlin to bind along F - actin and the accelerated depoly - merizationfromthepointedend . TheF82mutationimpaired the pH - dependent actin - depolymerizing activity of coﬁlin , suggesting that a hydrogen bond between the side chain hydroxyl of Tyr82 and the backbone carbonyl of Tyr117 is another structural element for the unique functional fold in the actin - binding helix of coﬁlin . Jiang et al . ( 1997 ) presented a contradictory report about a mutation of the equivalent tyrosine residue of a maize isoform of ADF / coﬁlin ( ZmADF3 ) . However , they worked with a double mutant and did not verify whether an F82 - equivalent mutation was responsible for the contradictory effect . We surmise that the side effects of the other mutation would have interfered with their evaluation of the role of Tyr82 . Role of the triad of hydrogen bonds in vital functions of coﬁlin This study demonstrated that two hydrogen bonds out of the triad are structural factors that modulate the biochemical activities of coﬁlin , including F - actin severing and acceler - ation of its directed subunit release . The central hydrogen bond is a primary element for both activities , while that involving Tyr82 is responsible for accelerating depoly - merization rather than for severing . This ﬁnding also suggests that the kink in the actin - binding helix of coﬁlin has functional signiﬁcance . Other mutational studies of coﬁlin / ADF in nematodes and yeast also mapped the important residues to the middle of the actin - binding helix ( Iida and Yahara , 1999 ; Ono et al . , 1999 ) . Ontheotherhand , themutationaleliminationofhydrogen bonds within the triad did not prevent normal cell growth ( Figure7 ) , suggestingthatapartialreductionintheactivities of coﬁlin is not critical for ordinary growth . However , a conditional growth defect was conferred by the A120 substitution of porcine coﬁlin or the A104 substitution in yeast COF1 , which disrupted the central hydrogen bond of the triad . Comparing this phenotype with the reduced biochemical activities of the A120 mutant suggests that the severing activity mediates vital functions of coﬁlin in vivo . In contrast , the F82 substitution of porcine coﬁlin or the F64 substitution in yeast COF1 did not seem to affect cell growth . As the F82 mutation impaired the accelerated actin dissociation at the pointed end much more than the severing activity , the ability of coﬁlin to accelerate directed depoly - merization and the consequent acceleration of treadmilling in F - actin may be less important for yeast growth than ﬁlament severing . Alternatively , the reduced ability to accelerate treadmilling in these yeast mutants might be compensated by another cellular factor ( s ) that could cooperate with coﬁlin in yeast cells . Thus , the physiological signiﬁcance of this activity might have been overlooked in our experiments . Although our results are consistent with the notion that the coﬁlin / ADF - induced acceleration of Activities of coﬁlin directed disassembly of actin ﬁlaments is primarily responsible for the rapid turnover of F - actin , they further suggestthattheseveringactivityofcoﬁlinisphysiologicallyimportant . Materials and methods Proteins and reagents Actin was puriﬁed from rabbit skeletal muscle by the method of Spudich and Watt ( 1971 ) , then gel - ﬁltrated on Sephacryl S - 200 equilibrated with G - buffer [ 2 mM Tris – HCl , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 pH 7 . 8 ] . Gelsolin was puriﬁed from bovine plasma according to the method of Kurokawa et al . ( 1990 ) . Human DBP was purchased from Calbiochem - Novabiochem Co . ( La Jolla , CA ) . Alexa488 - labelledactinand N - ( 1 - pyrenyl ) iodoacetamidewere obtained from Molecular Probes , Inc . ( Eugene , OR ) . Pyrenyl – actin was prepared by the method of Kouyama and Mihashi ( 1981 ) . Calcium - actin was converted into Mg - actin during a 3 min incubation in the presence of 0 . 2 mM EGTA and a 1 M equivalent plus a 10 μ M excess of MgCl 2 at room temperature . All other chemicals were of analytical grade . Plasmid construction and protein expression DNAwasmanipulatedconventionallyaccordingtoSambrook etal . ( 1989 ) . Site - speciﬁc mutations were generated by the two - step PCR protocol ( Kuipers et al . , 1991 ) . Coﬁlin mutant proteins were expressed in E . coli BL21 ( Rep4 ) and puriﬁed as described ( Moriyama et al . , 1996 ) . A His 6 tag was added to the C - terminus of every recombinant coﬁlin . For the yeast study , we used the multicopy plasmid , YEplac181 , and the centromere plasmid , YCplac111 ( Gietz and Sugino , 1988 ) . The authentic coﬁlin gene of S . cerevisiae , COF1 , wasmodiﬁedasdescribed ( Moriyama etal . , 1996 ) ; a unique intron was removed and Nco I and Bam HI sites were introduced at the beginning and end of the open reading frame ( ORF ) , respectively . A 1 . 2kbp Eco RI – Sph Ifragmentofthemodiﬁed COF1 genewastheninserted into YEplac181 or YCplac111 . The ORF of COF1 on YEplac181 was replaced with that of porcine coﬁlin mutants , and the ORF on YCplac111 was replaced with that of COF1 mutants . Measurement of depolymerization rates at pointed ﬁlament ends Calcium - G - actin ( 5 % pyrenyl - labelled ) was incubated for 3 min in the presence of a 1 M equivalent plus a 10 μ M excess of MgCl 2 at room temperature , then mixed with various concentrations of gelsolin . Poly - merization was initiated by adding MgCl 2 and KCl to 2 and 100 mM , respectively . Although we usually add EGTA to convert Ca - actin into Mg - actin before polymerization , the same handling in the presence of gelsolin produced deviations in the resulting number of ﬁlaments ( estimated from the depolymerization rate ) possibly because of inefﬁcient nucleation by gelsolin . Thus , we omitted EGTA and this resulted in better correlation of the depolymerization rate with the gelsolin concentration . The polymerized ﬁlaments consequently would consist of both Ca - and Mg - actins . After 3 h of polymerization at 28°C , His 6 - tagged coﬁlin and gelsolin – actin dimers ( 20 nM ) were added simultaneously and reacted for 10 min , during which a new steady - state was reached in pyrene ﬂuores - cence . Thebinarycomplexofgelsolinandactinshouldcapthefreebarbed ends generated by the severing action of coﬁlin . DBP , a potent actin - sequesteringagent , wasaddedtoinducedepolymerizationoftheﬁlaments . Gradual changes in ﬂuorescence intensity were monitored immediately . The dead - time was 4 – 8 s and the ﬁnal concentrations of actin and DBP were 3 . 3 and 3 . 5 μ M , respectively . Depolymerization proceeded in 120 μ l of 6 . 6 mM Tris – HCl , 14 . 6 mM HEPES – KOH , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM KCl , 85 μ M ATP , 0 . 51 mM EGTA , 15 μ M CaCl 2 , 0 . 18 mM DTT at pH 7 . 1 . End point ﬂuorescence intensity was measured after overnight reactions . Fluorescence data were collected at 25°C using a Perkin - Elmer LS - 50BLuminescencespectrophotometer . Thewavelengthsforexcitation and emission were 365 and 407 nm , respectively . Analysis of depolymerization kinetics To calculate the rate of monomer dissociation from actin ﬁlaments , the total amount of F - actin at the time of DBP addition must be determined . The amount of F - actin was calculated by subtracting that of monomeric actin from the total amount of actin after the monomer was quantiﬁed by a DNase I inhibition assay ( see below ) . Fluorescence intensity was converted to the concentration of F - actin for each kinetic assay , since both the initial and ﬁnal ( end point ) intensities of the pyrene ﬂuorescence were known . TheamountofF - actinperﬂuorescenceunitdependedsigniﬁcantly 6759 on the concentration of coﬁlin , but relatively little on that of gelsolin . Thus , the initial rate of depolymerization was calculated from that of the ﬂuorescence decrease and plotted against the initial concentration of gelsolin ( (cid:2) N o inthefollowingequations ) , whichequalstheinitialnumber of ﬁlaments ( Bryan and Coluccio , 1985 ; Janmey et al . , 1986 ; Weber et al . , 1994 ) . In practice , most of the ﬂuorescence intensity declined following exponential kinetics , indicating that the ﬁlament length distribution is exponential and that little fragmentation of F - actin continues during DBP - induced depolymerization . We therefore calculated the rate constant by adopting an exponential curve ﬁtting to the disassembly trace as far as when 80 % of F - actin disappeared . Then , the off - rate ( at time (cid:2) 0 ) was obtained as a product of the calculated rate constant and the initial concentration of F - actin . This procedure precluded an ambiguous deﬁni - tion of the off - rate . Under a deﬁned concentration of coﬁlin and assuming that ﬁlament severing by coﬁlin was stoichiometric , an apparent rate constant for the dissociation of the actin subunit from a pointed end and the number of severing events can be calculated as follows . If n cuts per unit volume are administered to gelsolin - capped actin ﬁlaments , the number ( concentra - tion ) of ﬁlament ends will be N p (cid:2) N o (cid:3) n ( 1 ) N b (cid:2) n ( 2 ) where N o is the initial number of ﬁlaments , and N p and N b are the numbers of free pointed and barbed ends , respectively . We only considered the reaction at pointed ends , since barbed ends should be capped by gelsolin – actin dimers . The back reaction , or subunit addition to ﬁlament ends , can also be neglected because it was eventually prevented under our experimental conditions . Hence , the off - rate was directly proportional to N p , and is expressed as V i (cid:2) k p – N p (cid:2) k p – ( N o (cid:3) n ) ( 3 ) where V i is the initial rate of DBP - induced depolymerization and k p – is the apparent rate constant for subunit dissociation at the pointed end . As described in Results , k p – is dependent on the amount of coﬁlin . According to Equation 3 , the plot of V i versus N o should give a linear regression line with a slope k p – that should intersect with the horizontal axis at – n . Moreprecisely , N o intheplotneedstobecorrected , becauseitdecreases during the pre - incubation with coﬁlin under the assumption that the ﬁla - ment length distribution is exponential . We replotted the data taking this into account , and found that the results were essentially similar to those using original N o , unless (cid:4) 1 . 4 μ M actin was depolymerized before DBP addition . For this reason , we presented the plots without the correction for N o to simplify understanding of our results . General biochemical assay for coﬁlin activities Monomeric actin just before the DBP induction of depolymerization was quantiﬁed by the DNase I inhibition assay ( Blikstad et al . , 1978 ) as modiﬁed by Harris et al . ( 1982 ) . Co - sedimentation assays proceeded as described ( Moriyama et al . , 1996 ) . The ability of His 6 - tagged coﬁlin and its mutant to associate with DNase I - bound G - actin was assessed using Ni 2 (cid:3) – nitrilotriacetic acid – Sepharose CL - 6B ( Qiagen Inc . , Chatsworth , CA ) . This assay was performed as described ( Moriyama et al . , 1996 ) except that DNase I – actin complex was used instead of free G - actin in the present study . Bands in polyacrylamide gels were quantiﬁed using a PDI420oe scanning densitometer and Quantity One Software ( PDI Inc . , New York , NY ) . Falling ball viscometry was performed as described ( Aizawa et al . , 1995 ) . Direct observation of ﬁlamentous actin Alexa 488 – actin ( 40 % labelled ) was converted to its Mg 2 (cid:3) form and polymerized for 2 h . Various concentrations of His 6 - tagged coﬁlin in 3 μ l were added to 2 μ l of 5 μ M polymerized Alexa – actin . The mixture consisting of 2 μ M F - actin , 20 mM PIPES – KOH , 8 . 8 mM Tris – HCl , 0 . 8 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 02 mM CaCl 2 , 100 mM KCl , 0 . 08 mM EGTA and 0 . 42 mM DTT ( pH 7 . 0 ) was incubated for 20 – 30 s , then 15 μ l of mounting medium , PermaFluor ( Immunon , Pittsburgh , PA ) , were added . A 4 μ l aliquot was placed onto a glass slide , coverslipped , and immediately observed under a Carl Zeiss epiﬂuorescence microscope ( Axiophot ) equipped with a 100 (cid:5) oil immersion objective . Microscope images were captured on a cooled CCD camera C4880 ( Hamamatsu Photonics , Shi - zuoka , Japan ) and recorded by an Argus - 50 image processor ( Hamamatsu Photonics ) . Urea denaturation assay His 6 - tagged wild - type or mutant coﬁlin ( 1 . 5 μ M ) was incubated with various amounts of urea in 20 mM Tris – HCl , 0 . 2 mM DTT ( pH 7 . 5 ) at K . Moriyama and I . Yahara room temperature for 60 min , then intrinsic ﬂuorescence was measured at anexcitationof280nmandemissionof330nm . Thedatawerenormalized and plotted as a function of the urea concentration . Complementation assay in S . cerevisiae Whether or not mutant coﬁlin can functionally replace authentic coﬁlin in S . cerevisiae wasdetermined by plasmid shufﬂingas described ( Moriyama et al . , 1996 ) . Strain HE8 ( MAT a leu2 ura3 trp1 his3 cof1 Δ : : HIS3 (cid:3) YCpYCS / COF1 / URA3 / CEN ) was transformed with a YCplac111 - based plasmid carrying mutated cof1 and a selectable LEU2 marker . Next , cells thathavelostYCpYCSwereselectedusing5 - ﬂuoro - oroticacid . Allcoﬁlin mutants tested here compensated for the lost COF1 gene . The thermo - sensitivity of each mutant strain was examined by streaking the colonies onto SC plates lacking leucine and histidine , then incubating them at various temperatures for 3 – 6 days . To examine heterologous comple - mentation by mutated porcine coﬁlin , we used a YEplac181 - instead of a YCplac111 - based plasmid . Acknowledgements We are very grateful to Dr H .
