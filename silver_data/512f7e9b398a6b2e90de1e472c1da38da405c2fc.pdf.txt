5 ( 2001 ) 525 – 532 Current Opinion in Solid State and Materials Science Self - organization and rigidity in network glasses * M . V . Chubynsky , M . F . Thorpe Department of Physics and Astronomy , Michigan State University , East Lansing , MI 48823 , USA Abstract Rigidity theory has helped in our understanding of the properties of network glasses . We analyze the connection between rigidity and various non - random features in the network structure . Lack of small rings in the network can lead to a sharper rigidity transition . We review a model of network self - organization that we have proposed , in which the existence of an intermediate phase that is rigid , but stress - free , is predicted . Finally , we discuss recent experiments , in which this intermediate phase may have been observed . (cid:211) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd . All rights reserved . 1 . Introduction the elastic moduli are zero in this model and remain quite small when the neglected forces are included [ 6 ] , as external strains can be accommodated without changing The systems under consideration in this mini - review are covalent bond lengths and bond angles in the network .

This means that bond lengths that is topologically disordered ( i . e . cannot be continuously and / or bond angles must be changed , at a considerable deformed into an ordered crystal ) , yet , as implied by the cost in energy , when the network is deformed . This word ‘continuous’ , has no macro - or mesoscopic voids and situation is described as rigidity percolation and can be thus is about as dense as the crystal ( Fig . 1 ) . This has understood by the following analogy .

There is a tion – relaxation technique by Barkema and Mousseau [ 25 ] single constraint associated with each bond .

In addition there The purpose of the work reviewed here is more modest : are constraints associated with the angular forces in Eq . to see what effects deviations from randomness can have ( 1 ) . For a twofold coordinated atom there is a single on the properties of networks . We describe this non - angular constraint ; for an r - fold coordinated atom there are randomness as self - organization , as the glasses organize a total of 2 r 2 3 angular constraints [ 3 ] . The total number themselves in such a way as to minimize their free energy of constraints is therefore at the temperature of glass formation , which is sometimes 4 called the ﬁctive temperature [ 29 ] .

The proper procedure would be sponding to the 3 N degrees of freedom in the system .

Also , it was suggested [ * 38 ] signiﬁcant difference in itself when compared to real that the negative of the number of ﬂoppy modes can serve networks that can be embedded in a three - dimensional as the free energy for the problem , and the order of the space . The rigidity transition in a RBM occurs in an transition can be determined from the behavior of this explosive - like manner , when an inﬁnite rigid cluster quantity . This correspondence with the free energy has not emerges all at once with the addition of a few constraints been proved in general except for the simplest cases [ * 38 ] . ( with no ﬁnite loops , there is no way to have a ﬁnite rigid cluster in this case ) . So the rigidity transition is ﬁrst order on RBM networks . This is seen in both order parameters as 3 .

Thus we observe two separate for what may be expected when there is a deﬁcit of small transitions , the rigidity - percolation transition at a lower rings . It would be desirable to construct more realistic mean coordination and the stress - percolation transition at a networks but with properties similar to the RBM . Real higher mean coordination , and in between these two networks inevitably have rings , yet not all of them are thresholds the intermediate phase forms , which is rigid , equally signiﬁcant : isolated rings of size larger than 6 are but unstressed . This is illustrated in Fig . 3 , in which the ﬂoppy and can be a part of a rigid cluster only if they fractions of sites in the percolating rigid cluster and the border other rings , and the larger the ring , the more percolating stressed region are shown as a function of the bordering rings are needed .

Self - organizing networks Within the pebble - game approach there is a rather unique opportunity to construct stress - free networks with - out a huge computational overhead . The basic idea is to start with a low - coordinated ﬂoppy network and add bonds . This leads to rigid regions being formed and as long as they are unstressed ( isostatic ) they are retained . By unstressed , we mean that each bond length ( angle ) can have its natural length ( angle ) without being forced to adjust by the surrounding environment . If adding a bond would result in that bond being redundant and hence create a stressed ( overconstrained ) region , then that move is abandoned . In this way the network self - organizes to avoid stress . When no independent ( non - redundant ) bond can be inserted , stress becomes inevitable and further insertion is continued at random .
