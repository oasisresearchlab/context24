ABSTRACT CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusions have been identified in gastric cancers , with a predominance in diffuse - type gastric cancers ( DGCs ) . Although in vitro experiments have suggested an oncogenic role for CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusions , the exact frequencies and clinicopathological characteristics of the fusion - positive cases are poorly understood . We analyzed 254 cases of gastric cancer ( 172 diffuse - type and 82 intestinal - type ) using RT - PCR and FISH , and also analyzed TCGA transcriptome datasets to identify genes that are related to the aggressive behaviors of fusion - positive cancers . Our assays identified 26 fusion - positive cases , 22 of which were DGCs ( 22 / 172 , 12 . 8 % ) . Unlike fusion - negative DGCs , almost all fusion - positive DGCs retained E - cadherin expression ( P = 0 . 036 ) . Fusion - positive DGCs also showed a higher prevalence of lymphatic and distant organ metastases , and these trends were only significant in the younger age group ( < 60 years ) . In this group , the majority of cases with distant organ metastases ( 4 of 6 cases ) were fusion - positive , and the multivariate regression analysis revealed that fusion status was an independent predictive marker for distant organ metastases ( P = 0 . 002 ) . In the TCGA dataset analysis , carbonic anhydrase 9 was postulated to be a potential modulator of the age - specific effects of the fusion protein , compatible with the immunohistochemical analysis of our cohort . Therefore , CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion - positive DGCs are considered biologically distinct entities that will require more advanced therapeutic options . INTRODUCTION Diffuse - type gastric cancer ( DGC ) constitutes one of two major histological subtypes of gastric cancers , the other being intestinal - type gastric cancer ( IGC ) . Histologically , DGC consists of poorly cohesive cancer cells with little or no glandular formation , frequently showing scirrhous growth patterns . Patients with DGC show poorer prognoses than those with IGC [ 1 ] . Whole - genome and whole - exome sequencing ( WGS / WES ) studies have shown that DGC rarely possesses amplifications of targetable receptor tyrosine kinases such as HER2 , while recurrent RHOA mutations specifically occur in 14 - 25 % of DGCs [ 2 – 4 ] . In addition , recurrent CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusions have been identified predominantly among DGCs [ 4 , 5 ] , and , importantly , RHOA mutations and CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusions were found to be mutually exclusive [ 4 ] . The frequencies of these fusions among gastric cancers has only been described in two cohorts and has been reported to be 14 . 8 % among genomically stable ( GS ) - type gastric cancers in a study conducted by The Cancer www . oncotarget . com Oncotarget , 2018 , Vol . 9 , ( No . 50 ) , pp : 29336 - 29350 Research Paper Oncotarget 29337 www . oncotarget . com Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) group [ 4 ] , and 3 . 0 % among 100 gastric cancers analyzed by Yao et al [ 5 ] . Therefore , the exact fusion frequency remains unclear and needs to be examined in an independent large cohort of gastric cancers . The CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion gene retains the sequences of four transmembrane domains of CLDN18 and a RhoGAP domain of ARHGAP ( Figure 1A ) ; therefore , the protein encoded by the fusion gene is predicted to exert the RhoGAP activity of RHOA [ 6 – 8 ] . In addition , the fusion gene loses the cytoplasmic portion of CLDN18 , which is involved in cell - cell adhesion through interactions with tight junction components [ 9 – 14 ] . In agreement , in vitro studies have demonstrated that CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 - transfected cancer cells showed reduced cell - cell adhesion and augmented invasiveness [ 5 ] . Considering these observations , it has been postulated that CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusions significantly impact the clinical behavior of gastric cancers . However , no studies to date have investigated the detailed clinicopathological features of fusion - positive gastric cancers . In the present study , we examined 254 gastric cancer cases ( 172 diffuse - type and 82 intestinal - type ) using several molecular pathology techniques combined with global gene expression analyses of public datasets , to determine the exact frequencies of the fusions and clarify the clinicopathological features of the fusion - positive cases . Our results revealed that fusion - positive DGCs tend to retain E - cadherin integrity and have a strong tendency towards advanced lymphatic and distant metastases among patients of younger ages . This study also suggests that the carbonic anhydrase 9 ( CA9 ) enzyme is a possible modulator of age - specific fusion effects . RESULTS CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion in gastric cancers analyzed by RT - PCR and FISH The fusion transcripts ( Figure 1A , 1B ) were detected by RT - PCR in 22 out of the 172 DGC cases and four out of the 72 IGC cases ( Figure 1C ) . Fusion types in DGCs were CLDN18 exon 5 - ARHGAP26 exon 12 ( n = 20 ) , CLDN18 exon 5 - ARHGAP26 exon 10 ( n = 1 ) , and CLDN18 exon 5 - ARHGAP6 exon 2 ( n = 1 ) . Only the CLDN18 exon 5 - ARHGAP26 exon 12 ( n = 4 ) fusion was found in the IGC cohort . The sequences of all amplicons were confirmed by the Sanger method ( Figure 1D , Supplementary Figure 1 ) . In the FISH analysis ( Figure 1G , Supplementary Figure 2 ) , split signals of the CLDN18 gene were identified in all RT - PCR positive gastric cancers . The mean percentage of cancer cells that showed split signals in each case was 16 . 4 ± 8 . 8 % ( average ± standard deviation ) , ranging from 9 . 2 % to 48 . 0 % . Immunohistochemical analysis of CLDN18 and ARHGAP26 To evaluate the correlations between gene fusions and protein expression of CLDN18 and ARHGAP26 , immunohistochemical analyses were performed for cases of DGC that were either with or without CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 fusions ( n = 21 and 44 , respectively ) . CLDN18 immunostaining was observed in cancer cells at the apical and lateral membranes of glandular cells and occasionally on the entire circumference of infiltrating cells ( Figure 2A ) . Diffuse CLDN18 immunostaining ( > 50 % ) was observed in 18 of 21 fusion - positive cases , but only in 15 of 44 fusion - negative cases ( P = 0 . 0001 ) . Almost all fusion - positive cancers showed positive CLDN18 immunostaining , suggesting that CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion expression is indispensable in the cases with gene fusions . Cytoplasmic ARHGAP26 immunostaining was observed in both normal and cancer cells ( Figure 2B ) . In addition , coexisting membranous immunostaining was observed in 11 of 21 ( 52 . 4 % ) fusion - positive cases , but in 14 of 44 ( 31 . 8 % ) fusion - negative cases ( P = 0 . 172 ) . Although DGCs with fusions tended to show membranous staining of ARHGAP26 , there were no statistically significant differences in the staining frequencies from fusion - negative DGCs . Clinicopathological analysis of DGCs with and without CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusions The clinicopathological features of DGCs with and without CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusions are presented in Table 1a . Fusion - positive DGCs showed significantly larger sizes ( P = 0 . 013 , mean tumor size : 8 . 5 vs . 6 . 3 cm ) , and lymph node and distant organ metastases were more frequently observed in fusion - positive DGCs than in fusion - negative DGCs ( P = 0 . 014 and 0 . 003 , respectively ) . For fusion - positive cases , organ metastases were detected in the liver ( 2 cases ) ; pancreas and retroperitoneum ( 1 case ) ; and liver , pancreas , and ovaries ( 1 case ) . For fusion - negative cases , tumor metastases were detected in the ovary ( 1 case ) and liver ( 1 case ) . As loss of E - cadherin expression is one of the most well - known aberrations in DGC , we examined E - cadherin immunohistochemical staining in our DGC cohort . Interestingly , while a portion of the fusion - negative DGCs ( 16 / 28 , 36 . 3 % ) showed loss of E - cadherin immunoreactivity , most of the fusion - positive DGCs ( 19 / 21 , 90 . 4 % ) retained positive E - cadherin staining ( P = 0 . 036 ) ( Figure 3A , 3B ) . Distant metastases were observed among relatively young patients who were less than 60 years of age . Therefore , the clinicopathological factors of the DGCs with or without gene fusions were further examined statistically between younger patients and those older than 60 years ( Table 1b , 1c ) . In the older age group , there were no statisticaly significant differences in the Oncotarget 29338 www . oncotarget . com examined clinicopathological factors , with the exception of a mild difference in the mean tumor sizes of DGCs with and without fusions . On the other hand , in the younger age group , fusion - positive DGCs showed higher Figure 1 : ( A ) Schematic diagram of the domains of wild - type CLDN18 , wild - type ARHGAP26 , and the major CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 fusion protein .

In our cohort , while distant organ metastases were not observed in the older age group , most ( 4 out of 6 ) of the cases with distant organ metastases in the younger age group were fusion - positive . The multivariate analysis of younger patients with DGCs revealed that fusion status and peritoneal dissemination / malignant ascites statuses were independent predictive factors of distant organ metastasis ( Table 2 ) . Age - related changes in genomic status and gene expression profile In the present study , influences of fusion genes on malignant phenotypes were observed only in the younger age group . Therefore , we tested whether differences existed between younger and older age groups , in background mutation densities of whole cancer exomes and / or frequencies of 25 driver gene mutations ( TP53 , CDH1 , SMAD4 , PIK3CA , RHOA , ARID1A , KRAS , MUC6 , APC , BCOR , EYA4 , BNC2 , RNF43 , ABCA10 , CTNNB1 , MACF1 , SMAD2 , SOHLH2 , RASA1 , FAM46D , PLB1 , CNGA4 , AGO4 , ERBB2 , PTPRC , which were reported as significantly mutated genes in non - hypermutated gastric cancers in the TCGA study ) . Significant correlations were not observed between patient age and whole exome mutation density or driver gene mutation frequency ( data not shown ) . To obtain molecular insights regarding the age - specific fusion effects , we examined differences in gene Figure 2 : CLDN18 and ARHGAP26 expression in DGCs with fusions .

Membranous immunostaining of ARHGAP26 is observed in 11 of 21 ( 52 . 4 % ) fusion - positive cases and in 14 of 44 ( 31 . 8 % ) fusion - negative cases ( P = 0 . 172 ) .

We selected up - or down - regulated genes , with RNA expression levels that significantly changed by more than 5 - fold between younger and older groups with the fusions . We identified 11 upregulated and 22 downregulated genes in the younger group ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Among these genes , we focused on CA9 , because previous studies have shown that CA9 promotes tumor cell migration and invasion in vitro by inhibiting the RHOA pathway , and is highly expressed in younger patients with cervical and hepatocellular malignancies [ 15 , 16 ] . As stated above , CLDN18 fusions are expected to inhibit the RHOA pathway [ 5 ] , and in some contexts , RHOA inhibition promotes cancer cell invasion in vitro [ 17 ] . Based on these observations , we hypothesized that the malignant phenotypes of cancer cells are further exaggerated by CA9 expression in younger individuals with DGC . To validate the relationship of CLDN18 fusions with age and CA9 expression level , we performed immunohistochemical analyses of CA9 across 65 selected DGCs , as described in the Materials and Methods section ( Figure 4 ) . In agreement with the results from the TCGA dataset , CA9 immunohistochemistry showed higher protein expression in the younger group than in the older group ( P = 0 . 152 ) . In the younger group , CA9 expression was significantly higher in fusion - positive cancers than in fusion - negative cancers ( P = 0 . 042 ) . Moreover , CA9 expression was higher in cases with distant organ metastases ( P = 0 . 059 ) . On the other hand , in the older group , no statistical associations were observed between the CA9 expression and fusion status .

The frequency of the CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusions among the DGCs was consistent with the TCGA data , from which eight ( 14 . 8 % ) of 54 GS - type cancers had the fusions [ 4 ] . The frequency observed in our study is also considered comparable with the frequency that was reported in the study of Yao et al . , in which three cases were fusion - positive among 100 gastric cancers , including 30 DGC cases [ 5 ] . Our clinicopathological analyses showed that gastric cancers with the fusions tended to have larger diameter and more lymph node and distant metastases than gastric cancers without the fusions . Most ( 4 out of 6 ) of the gastric cancers with distant organ metastases were CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion - positive . We also observed that fusion status and peritoneal dissemination / malignant ascites were independent predictive factors for distant organ metastases in younger individuals with DGC . Therefore , fusion status is a clinically important and useful biomarker , in consideration of therapeutic strategies . Although our study is the largest study to have focused on DGCs with CLND18 fusions [ 4 , 5 ] , only 22 of the included patients had fusion - positive DGCs . Therefore , more patients with fusion - positive DGCs should be further examined , to obtain definitive conclusions . CLDN18 interacts with tight junction proteins via a PDZ - domain binding motif in its C - terminus and maintains cell - cell or cell - extracellular matrix adhesions [ 18 , 19 ] . Because CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 lacks the cytoplasmic portion ( C - terminus region ) of CLDN18 and the N - terminal domain of ARHGAP26 / 6 ( Figure 1A ) , it is possible that the fusion protein alters cell - cell or cell - extracellular matrix adhesions . In addition , aberrant regulations of the Rho pathway , which could take place upon fusion of ARHGAP with a RhoGAP domain to CLDN18 with transmembrane domains , may influence tumor cell movements and invasiveness . In agreement , an in vitro analysis that was reported by Yao et al . demonstrated that tumor cells stably expressing CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 showed weak cell - cell adhesions and strong invasiveness , through inhibition of the RHOA pathway [ 5 ] . Furthermore , E - cadherin expression is preserved , with significantly higher rates in fusion - positive DGCs than in fusion - negative DGCs . Consistent with these findings , the TCGA data also showed that the CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion was mutually exclusive with CDH1 mutations . Taking the above - mentioned results into consideration , the CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion is speculated to be a strong driver that substantially influence both abnormal RHOA signaling and cell - cell adhesions , which could otherwise be achieved by RHOA and CDH1 mutations .

Our detailed clinicopathological analyses of fusion - positive cases revealed that the fusion status had strong impact on tumor progressions , i . e . , higher T , N , and M stages , only in the younger age group , and such correlations were not observed in the older age group . We then focused on the relationship between gene fusion and CA9 expression and found , in our cohort , that CA9 expression levels were higher in fusion - positive cases only among the younger age group . In addition to the evidence for correlations between CA9 and RHOA functions [ 16 , 17 ] , CA9 has also been found to promote cervical cancer cell invasions by inhibiting RHOA in vitro [ 20 ] . These results suggest that , in younger patients , fusion - positive gastric cancer cells invade and metastasize through fusion protein - mediated inhibition of RHOA and elevated expression of CA9 . Our immunohistochemical analysis showed that almost all CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 fusion - positive cases expressed CLDN18 , about half of which expressed ARHGAP26 in the membrane , which likely reflects the requirement of CLDN18 promoter activity for expression of the fusion protein in tumor cells . On the other hand , ARHGAP26 is usually expressed in the cytoplasm of normal tissue cells and some tumor cells [ 21 ] . However , we detected membranous expression of ARHGAP26 in about half of the fusion - positive cases and about one - quarter of the fusion - negative cases . The higher rate of membranous staining of ARHGAP26 in the fusion - positive cases can be explained by the structure of the N - terminal membrane protein CLDN18 in the fusion . The lack of membranous staining of ARHGAP26 in some of the fusion - positive cases might be due to the problems with detection sensitivity , for example , due to low expression of the fusion protein or conformation changes of the antibody - targeted C - terminus region , which could be caused by N - terminal fusion . It remains unclear why some of the fusion - negative cases also showed membranous staining patterns . One possible reason involves the interaction with membrane - localized focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , via the SH3 domain [ 6 , 22 ] . FAK is known to regulate cell adhesion , motility , proliferation , and survival in many cell types [ 23 ] and is overexpressed in various cancers , including gastric cancer [ 4 , 24 ] . This partially explains the membranous staining of ARHGAP26 . Although the relationship between fusion status and immunolocalization was not so completely parallel , the driver nature of the fusion has been clearly shown by Yao’s report [ 5 ] . They showed that the fusion induced the epithelial mesenchymal transition and increased cancer invasiveness by inhibiting the RHOA pathway . In the TCGA datasets , the fusion and RHOA mutations were mutually exclusive . This mutual exclusivity was confirmed in our study ( data not shown ) and provides strong genetic evidence that both the CLDN18 - ARHGAP fusion and RHOA mutations are cancer drivers in the same pathway . In this context , additional RHOA pathway inhibition is induced by the CA9 protein and , as is discussed above , deterioration of cell - cell adhesion by the fusion protein is responsible for the distinctly aggressive malignant feature of fusion - positive cancers . In summary , we investigated the clinicopathological characteristics of CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion - positive gastric cancers and found that fusion - positive DGCs have strong metastatic ability , a phenotype that is more obvious in younger patients . We identified CA9 , which is highly expressed in fusion - positive cases of younger individuals , as a potential modulator of abnormal RHOA signaling Figure 4 : Relationships between CA9 expression and CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 fusion status evaluated by immunohistochemistry .

As is suggested by the very low frequency of E - cadherin aberrations among fusion - positive DGCs , this type of gastric cancer could have different biological characteristics from usual DGCs . Therefore , CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion is a clinically relevant biomarker for the prediction of highly aggressive DGCs , for which more advanced therapeutic options are necessary . To this point , the CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 / 6 fusion protein , a driver that contributes to highly aggressive phenotypes , is a strong drug target candidate , based on its accessibility on the cell membrane and its complete absence in non - cancer cells . In fact , an anti - CLDN18 monoclonal antibody , claudiximab [ 25 ] , has been developed for gastric cancers and is currently being evaluated in clinical trials . It is also possible that information regarding fusion status constitutes a useful biomarker for selecting patient subgroups with distinct responses . MATERIALS AND METHODS Case selection and clinical data The pathological records of 1 , 163 patients with gastric cancers at the University of Tokyo Hospital from 2000 to 2013 were available and reviewed by two pathologists ( A . T . and T . U . ) . To obtain a gastric cancer cohort of appropriate size , 172 consecutive cases of DGC were selected . Exclusion criteria were : ( i ) small tumor size ( < 0 . 5 cm ) , ( ii ) Epstein - Barr Virus - associated gastric carcinomas ; and ( iii ) cases used in the previous WES study [ 3 ] . Eighty - two cases of IGC were also selected as controls . Clinical data including symptoms , laboratory data , endoscopic findings , and imaging data were extracted from medical records . Macroscopic tumor types were classified according to the criteria of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) classification for early gastric cancers and the Borrmann classification for advanced gastric cancers [ 26 ] . Tumor stages were determined using the 8th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer guideline for tumor , node , and metastasis ( TNM ) classification . All research protocols in the present study were approved by our institutional review boards . Histological assessment Two pathologists reviewed hematoxylin and eosin - stained ( H - E ) sections of all gastric cancers in this study , and determined the lesion size , depth of invasion , vascular invasion , lymph node metastasis , Lauren’s classification , and pathological stages according to the criteria of the WHO classification criteria [ 26 ] . RNA extraction Ten - micrometer - thick sections were sliced from the formalin - fixed paraffin embedded ( FFPE ) tissues and mounted onto glass slides . Adjacent 4 - micrometer - thick sections were subjected to the H - E staining to confirm the tumor contents , after which the tumor areas were manually dissected from the corresponding 10 - micrometer sections . RNA was extracted using the RecoverAll™ Total Nucleic Acid Isolation kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . RT - PCR for CLDN18 - ARHGAP transcripts Total RNA was subjected to complementary DNA ( cDNA ) synthesis with random primers using PrimeScript™ RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser ( Takara Co . , Ltd . , Kyoto , Japan ) . PCR reactions were then performed in a reaction volume of 10 μl containing 0 . 2 mM dNTP , 2 μl 5X PrimeSTAR GXL Buffer , 0 . 2 μl PrimeSTAR GXL DNA Polymerase ( all from Takara ) , 0 . 3 μM forward primer , 0 . 3 μM reverse primer , and 1 μl cDNA to detect fusion transcripts ( Figure 1B ) . PCR primers were as follows : CLDN18 exon 5 - ARHGAP26 exon 12 ( Fw1 primer : 5’ - TTGGGTCCAACACCAAAAAC - 3’ , Rv1 primer : 5’ - TCTGGCTGTCTTTGTTCGAG - 3’ , product size 87 bp ) , CLDN18 exon 5 - ARHGAP26 exon 10 ( Fw1 , Rv2 primer : 5’ - TGCTTCCACATCAAAGCAAA - 3’ , product size 146 bp ) and CLDN18 exon 5 - ARHGAP6 exon 2 ( Fw2 primer : 5’ - GCCACAGTGTTGCCTACAAG - 3’ , Rv3 primer : 5’ - CTGACATGCTGTTCCAGGTG - 3’ , product size 135 bp ) . We also evaluated the cDNA qualities using primers for GAPDH ( forward : 5’ - CAACGGATTTGGTCGTATTGG - 3’ , reverse : 5’ - GC AACAATATCCACTTTACCAGAGTTAA - 3’ , product size 72 bp ) . PCR thermal cycling conditions were as follows : initial denaturation at 98°C for 2 min , followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 98°C for 20 s , annealing at 55°C for 15 s and extension at 68°C for 30 s , and final extension at 68°C for 3 min . The PCR product for each case was visualized using a capillary electrophoresis machine , MCE® - 202 MultiNA ( Shimadzu , Kyoto , Japan ) . All amplicons targeting fusion genes were sequenced by the Sanger method . Fluorescence in situ hybridization for CLDN18 gene translocation All cases that showed RT - PCR positivity were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) , a dual - color CLDN18 - split assay . Four - micrometer - thick sections were de - paraffinized in xylene , dehydrated in ethanol , and dried . The sections were then incubated with Pretreatment Solution ( GSP Lab , Inc . , Hyogo , Japan ) at 95 - 100°C for 30 min , then treated with 0 . 8 % pepsin solution ( Sigma P - 7125 , Sigma - Aldrich Corp . , St . Louis , MO , USA ) in 0 . 2 N HCl at 37°C for 10 min . The sections were washed in 2 x saline - sodium citrate ( SSC ) , then in ethanol , and air dried . Dual - color break - apart FISH for the detection of CLDN18 gene Oncotarget 29348 www . oncotarget . com translocations was performed by using commercially available probes ( GSP Lab , Inc . ) . The first 430 kb long probe labelled with Texas Red recognized the proximal region of the CLDN18 gene , whereas the second FITC - labelled probe corresponded to the 740 kb distal ( 3′ ) region of the CLDN18 gene ( Figure 1E ) . The probe set for CLDN18 was applied to the sections according to the manufacturer’s instructions and hybridized at 37°C for 48 hours . After hybridization , the sections were washed in 2 x SSC / 0 . 3 % Nonidet P40 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) at 72°C for 5 min and subsequently washed in ethanol twice . Then , the sections were counterstained with DAPI , 4’6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole . The slides were visualized with the Leica LM6000B imaging system ( Leica Microsystems , Wetzlar , Germany ) and analyzed using LAS X version 1 . 0 imaging software ( Leica Microsystems ) . Split signal was defined as signals observed 2 or more diameters apart . Samples were considered positive for CLDN18 gene translocation when more than 5 % of tumor cells harbored split signals , counting at least 100 cells . The mean split signal rate of the normal background epithelia in 5 gastric cancer cases was only 0 . 4 % with a standard deviation of 0 . 54 ( Figure 1F ) . Case selection for immunohistochemistry of CLDN18 , ARHGAP26 , CA9 , and E - cadherin To evaluate protein expression patterns of CLDN18 , ARHGAP26 , CA9 , and E - cadherin in gastric cancers by immunohistochemistry , we selected 65 representative cases : 21 DGCs with the CLDN18 - ARHGAP26 fusions and 44 DGCs without the fusions as controls . Control cases were matched in terms of locus , T stage , N stage , M stage , age , sex , tumor size , and lymphovascular invasion status . Immunohistochemistry FFPE tissues were cut into 4 - micrometer - thick sections and de - paraffinized with xylene , after which an antigen retrieval procedure was performed . Immunohistochemical analyses were conducted with antibodies against CLDN18 ( Product No . 38 - 8000 , 1 : 1000 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , ARHGAP26 ( HPA035107 , 1 : 50 , Atlas antibodies , Bromma , Sweden ) , CA9 ( AB108351 , 1 : 250 , Abcam , Inc . , Cambridge , CA , USA ) , and E - cadherin ( Product No . 610182 , 1 : 200 , BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA , USA ) using a Ventana Benchmark XT autostainer system ( Ventana Medical Systems , Inc . , Tucson , AZ , USA ) . Immunostaining was semi - quantitatively evaluated ( 0 to 100 , with 5 % steps ) according to the proportions of positive membrane staining among cancerous cell populations . Evaluation of immunohistochemistry was independently performed by two pathologists ( A . T . and T . U . ) . In cases with discrepancies in the immunohistochemistry scores between the two pathologists , they reviewed the cases in together and consensus scores were determined . Extraction and analysis of TCGA data Genomic status ( e . g . , driver mutations and mutation frequencies ) , RNA - sequencing data , and clinical information of TCGA stomach adenocarcinoma cases were downloaded from cBioPortal site ( http : / / www . cbioportal . org / ) . We found 255 age - identified samples and classified the subjects into four subgroups according to fusion statuses and ages ( < 60 or ≥ 60 ) . We analyzed associations between numbers of somatic mutations among 25 driver genes , exome - wide mutation densities , and patient ages . Then , to find genes related to the age - specific fusion effects on aggressive behaviors of cancer cells , we selected up - or downregulated genes with RNA expression levels that significantly changed more than 5 times between young and old groups among fusion - positive DGCs . Statistical analysis Patient ages and tumor sizes derived from the TCGA data were compared between groups using the Mann – Whitney U test . Other categorical variables were compared using Fisher’s exact test . Multivariate analyses of distant organ metastases using factors which showed P - values < 0 . 05 in univariate analysis were performed with the logistic regression model . A backward elimination method was used with a threshold of P = 0 . 05 to select variables for the final model . Statistical analysis was performed using JMP Pro 11 software ( SAS , Cary , NC , USA ) . RNA expression data were analyzed using CLC Main Workbench 7 software ( QIAGEN Inc . , Valencia , CA , USA ) and the t - test . All statistical analyses were considered significant with P - values < 0 . 05 .
