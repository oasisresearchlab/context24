We present here a new 3D force sensing method with high bandwidth ( up to 10Khz ) which can allow implementing complex robotic approaches . Proposed technique uses high speed image tracking with nano - metric resolution in 3 directions . Its capabilities are demonstrated in a teleoperated 3D manipulation scenario with a haptic user interface , where naive users performed direct in vitro haptic exploration of isolated Red Blood Cells inside a Petri dish . I . INTRODUCTION Among a variety of microrobotic techniques , Optical Tweezers are considered to be one of the most suitable for biological characterization and manipulation [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] . They consist on using the radiation pressure of a tightly focused laser beam to trap a micro - object in liquid solution [ 3 ] . The generated force can go up to few hundreds of pico - Newton . Although seemingly low , this is well in the range of micro - biological interactions and Optical Tweezers have successfully applied to a range of applications from sorting biological objects [ 4 ] to assembling complex micro - structures [ 5 ] . An inert , bio - compatible bead is generally used as a probe to avoid laser exposure to biological objects . Additionally , in this case the effect of the trap is akin to a linear stiffness around the focal point of the beam and the force acting on the object can be obtained by measuring its motion [ 6 ] . This particularity has led to the use of Optical Tweezers for force sensing , for example in mechanical characterization of molecular interactions [ 7 ] and of the cell membrane [ 8 ] . Current robotic research on Optical Tweezers focuses on the implementation of control techniques for automation [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] or teleoperation [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] . These works consider the trapped probe as the end - effector , and the external forces acting on the probe can be used in the feedback path to close the control loop . This forces can be provided by tracking the motion of the probe under the optical microscope . Considering the force range and the trap † These authors contributed equally to this work . * This work was supported by the French National Research Agency through the ANR - IOTA project ( ANR - 16 - CE33 - 0002 - 01 ) , and partially by the French government research program ”Investissements d’avenir” through the Robotex Equipment of Excellence ( ANR - 10 - EQPX - 44 ) . 1 M .

This kind of performance would make Optical Tweezers a formidable apparatus for micromanipulation in general and for biology and biochemistry in particular . Nevertheless , high dynamics effects at the microscale and the limitations of the optical microscope render most classical algorithms useless . Hence , the lack of robust 3D tracking reduces most applications to simple planar tasks . Also , the latency and low bandwidth hurts the system stability and its real - time capabilities [ 15 ] . Several methods to improve the tracking has been de - veloped . Most commonly , a quadrant photodiode ( QDP ) is used to sample the position of the target at tens of kHz with nanometric precision [ 16 ] . Nonetheless , this method is vulnerable to occlusions and disturbances and works reliably only on isolated objects . An alternative is image process - ing through video cameras integrated into the microscope . However , state - of - art real - time visual tracking algorithms on commercial CMOS cameras can rarely exceed 60 Hz [ 17 ] . Limiting the imaging to a smaller region of interest ( ROI ) can accelerate processing , at the detriment of resolution and precision [ 18 ] . By combining a high - speed CMOS with tracking implemented on GPUs ( Graphics Processing Unit ) , 3D tracking at several of kHz is reported [ 19 ] . This approach is however fairly complex as it requires special knowledge and hardware . As an alternative to classical CMOS cameras , silicon retina sensors were proposed [ 20 ] . These “asynchronous time - based image sensor”s are frame - free and eliminate data redundancy by design . They are shown to allow the 2D tracking at an unprecedented speed in the order of tens of kilo - Hertz [ 21 ] . Because of the particularity of the image data that they provide , well - known processing techniques cannot be used . Further investigations are especially needed for real - time 3D robust tracking . We present here a 3D motion tracking technique using an event - based algorithm taking advantage of a silicon retina sensor . It provides pico - Newton resolution and its bandwidth reaches 10 kHz . Its capabilities are demonstrated in a teleop - erated 3D manipulation scenario with a haptic user interface . This kind of control scheme is very demanding and requires indeed a feedback loop at 1 kHz for stability . II . 3D HIGH - SPEED FORCE SENSING A . System Description The optical scheme of the system is shown in Fig . 1 ( a ) . It’s based on an inverted microscope where the same objective is used for both imaging and producing the optical trap . Its singularity is to include an ATIS , “asynchronous time - based 2017 IEEE / RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems ( IROS ) September 24 – 28 , 2017 , Vancouver , BC , Canada 978 - 1 - 5386 - 2682 - 5 / 17 / $ 31 . 00 ©2017 IEEE 1889 Z = 2µm Z = 1µm Z = 0µm Z = - 1µm Z = - 2µm ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) White LED LED lens f 5 Objective40x f 2 Laser 1070nm f 1 CMOS ATIS BS f 3 f 4 DM 3D nanostage Probe CMOS image ATIS image ROI t 1 ROI t 2 C t2 ( P t , R t2 ) E ( p , t ) X Y O ATIS coordinate C t1 ( P t , R t1 ) Fig . 1 . ( a ) Optical scheme . The source is a 1070 nm laser with a maximum output of 10 Watts . An oil immersion objective ( Olympus UPlanFLN 40x , NA 1 . 3 ) produces a ﬁxed optical trap . Two microstages ( x - y ) and a 3D nanostage provide respectively coarse and ﬁne positioning of samples . The illumination ( LED , 3W ) is reﬂected by a long pass dichroic mirror ( 900nm cut - off ) then is divided by an unpolarized beam splitter ( R9 : T1 ) into the silicon retina camera ( ATIS , 240 × 304 pixels ) and the CMOS camera ( Basler , 659 × 494 pixels ) f 1 = 30 , f 2 = 125 , f 3 = 100 , f 4 = − 50 , f 5 = 45 , ( b ) Image of microbead ( 3 µ m polystyrene ) under the system . First column : the CMOS image at different z - displacements respect to the focus plane ( z = 0 ) . Second column : the corresponding ATIS image with 33 ms accumulation time . Different colors indicate positive or negative polarity of the events . The displacements are in µ m . ( c ) Working principle of the event - based ring tracking algorithm . image sensor” silicon retina . ATIS has the particularity to be adaptable to high - speed on - line tracking due to its efﬁcient encoding of movements , as the data redundancy is eliminated by design . Each pixel is electronically independent and generate events immediately when a light variation above a threshold is detected . This data is asynchronous and an event may have positive or negative polarity . More details of this technology are discussed in [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] . In a scene with the stable light environment , only the dy - namic information stimulated by moving object is recorded . In the case of the presented system , the trap center has a ﬁxed position in the ATIS image . With an appropriate threshold , image variations are mostly generated on the contour of the trapped bead as shown in Fig . 1 ( b ) . This information is exploited to infer the 3D motion of the probe . B . 3D Tracking Fig . 1 ( b ) shows the conventional and event - based images of the probe . In ATIS image , accumulated events can be grouped in two concentric circles . Their center position is related to the planar motion of the probe while the radius is linked to the depth position . An event - based ring tracking algorithm is developed . It’s used to recognize both circles , then to selectively extract center position and radius parame - ters from the inner one . Indeed , when the probe is in contact with other samples , the inner one is much more robust and stable . However , it’s necessary to track both circles to be able to set them apart . The principle of ring tracking is to minimize the distance of the events’ spatial coordinates and the ring model [ 24 ] as presented in Fig . 1 ( c ) . Denoting E ( p , t ) as an event occurs at time t with spatial location p = ( x , y ) in ATIS coordinate . U ( t ) is deﬁned as the set of useful events’ locations at time t : U ( t ) = { E ( p , t ) | p ∈ ROI ( t ) } ( 1 ) where ROI ( t ) is the region of interest ( ROI ) of one circle model at time t [ 25 ] . Since the ﬁtting methods are vulnerable to noise , the ROI is used as solution to ﬁlter the outliers . Suppose that the unknown circle model’s parameters at time t is C t ( P t , R t ) , where P t = ( X t , Y t ) is the circle center’s position and R t is the radius . Then , a fast non - iterative algebraic ﬁt [ 26 ] minimizes the cost function : min P t ∈ R 2 R t ∈ R (cid:88) p k ∈ U ( t ) (cid:107) d ( p k , P t ) 2 − R 2 t (cid:107) 2 ( 2 ) where p k is the k th event’s location in U ( t ) . d ( p k , P t ) is Euclidean distance between p k and the circle center P t . Introducing parameters A = − 2 X t , B = − 2 Y t , and C = X t 2 + Y t 2 − R t 2 , ( 2 ) can be written as a linear least square problem : min P t ∈ R 2 R t ∈ R (cid:88) p k ∈ U ( t ) (cid:107) Ax k + By k + C + x k 2 + y k 2 (cid:107) 2 ( 3 ) Solving A , B , and C , gives the parameters of circle ( P t , R t ) . This single circle tracking method is used to parametrize the two concentric circles of the ring ( inner C 1 t and outer C 2 t ) . All incoming event occurring in a considered time interval are assigned to the closest circle model . Events at the intersection of two ROIs are discarded to reduce the ambiguity . This condition makes sure that the inner and outer circle will not become into one . The ROIs are updated accordingly . The algorithm is given below .

( c ) The relative inner radii change ( in pixels ) with the microsphere’s axial position ( in µ m ) . At focus plane , the inner radius is 64 pixels . The linear regression coefﬁcients show the conversion between pixels in ATIS coordinates and micrometers in the world coordinates . C . Evaluation of tracking 1 ) Range and resolution : A 3 µ m silica microsphere ﬁxed to the sample - holder is used to evaluate the tracking . Fig . 2 gives the real displacement , as reported by the nanostage vs tracked motion in pixels for all directions as well as the calculated pixel / µ m transform . The detectable motion range is 6 µ m and 7 µ m for x and y respectively with less than 3 % standard deviation ( SD ) . On z - axis , the relative radii variance is shown in Fig . 2 ( c ) . The linear detection range is about ± 2 µ m around the focus plane with 5 % SD . This 3D detection range ( 6 × 7 × 4 µ m ) is sufﬁcient since the linearity of the trap stiffness is valid around one diameter of the trapped bead [ 6 ] , here 3 × 3 × 3 µm 3 . With 204 × 304 pixels , the theoretical resolution is 23 . 8nm / pixel in x and y and 166 . 6 nm / pixel in z . Practically , the bead center position and radius were estimated with sub - pixel accuracy using the circle tracking algorithm . This sensitivity varies in different illumination conditions and working environment . 2 ) Robustness : Robustness here is deﬁned as the ability to extract the 3D position of the target from noisy data , or even a small subset of data . It will be tested under two most commonly encountered situations partial occlusion i . e . only part of the target image is captured , and obstacles disturbances i . e . to track the target among many obstacles . In the occlusion test , the microsphere’s image is partially out of the view of ATIS . The tracking errors for 30 % occlusion of the inner circle are shown in Fig . 3 ( c ) . As can be seen , for less than 30 % occlusion , the tracking error and the SD are less than 5 % for both lateral and axial detection . In obstacles disturbance test , the target bead ( in the center ) is surrounded by two other similar objects as shown in Fig . 3 ( d ) . They are ﬁxed on Petri - dish and animated with a sinusoidal movement . The tracking result is shown in Fig . 3 ( f ) . The lateral tracking errors are less than ± 5 % with 2 % SD in within ± 2 . 5 µ m . The axial errors are less than ± 20 % around the focus plane with less than 10 % SD . As the image plane move far away from focus plane , the radius error increases up to 30 % . 3 ) Computational Load : The algorithm is implemented in C + + on a hard real - time framework . The testing relies on a 2 . 9 GHz Dual core desktop PC , with a total CPU load about 50 % of its power and a memory consumption of about 4 MB . The average running time for each iteration is less than 60 µ s , with less than 2 µ s deviation . Then the system is successfully pushed to 10 kHz real - time sampling rate . III . 3D HAPTIC FEEDBACK OPTICAL TWEEZERS A . Haptic Coupling In order to show its beneﬁts and validate the proposed force sensing , a teleopration scenario with haptic feedback is implemented . This is a demanding application from the control point of view as the stability and transparency of haptic feedback coupling requires a sampling of 1 kHz [ 27 ] , [ 15 ] .

The schematic diagram of the bilateral coupling of the position and force in the haptic OTs system . Tweezers but were limited to 2D [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] . The 3D tracking allows for a real spatial coupling in this case . Haptic feedback requires a bilateral control scheme , as presented in Fig . 4 . In this scheme , the user handles the haptic interface ( Omega . 7 , ForceDimension ) . Its position is used to control the motion of the sample through the nano - stage . The force measured on the probe is feedback to the user with an appropriate gain . Motion of the master device is scaled down by 6 × 10 − 4 to drive the trap position relatively to sample holder . Actually , the trap position is ﬁxed , and the mobile part is the nanostage holding the samples . Nano - stage can be driven in two modes , rate - control to cover the whole working space ( 200 × 200 µ m ) , and position - control to execute precise tasks . The measured forces are magniﬁed by 1 × 10 12 and sent back to the user . The force on the trap is calculated using the optical force model [ 6 ] : F opt = K × ( P laser − P probe ) ( 4 ) where P laser − P probe represent the displacement between the laser and the probe position as obtained from the tracking method . K is the stiffness of the trap . This stiffness can be calculated experimentally using the Equipartition method [ 28 ] . Considering 30 mW laser power it is estimated in x - axis , y - axis and z - axis as K x = 12 . 3 pN / µm , K y = 12 . 6 pN / µm s and K z = 1 . 5 pN / µm respectively under room temperature of 25 . 5 ◦ C . A single PC ( Intel Xeon core , 2 . 93 GHz ) operating under a real - time co - kernel Linux and RTOS APIs Xenomai is used to control the system . The control - loop runs with a force refresh rate of 1 kHz .

Red Blood Cells ( RBC ) are easy to acquire and have an 3D irregular dumbbell - shaped proﬁle , and hence are well suited for this illustration . They are ﬁxed in 4 % formaldehyde for biological stability . Probes are 3 µ m polystyrene beads incubated in PBS and Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) solution to prevent the surface sticking . 1 ) z - axis Haptic Feedback : The ﬁrst experiment will validate the force feedback on z axis . The RBC sample is ﬁxed on the bottom of a Petri Dish . The user ﬁrst traps a bead to serve as probe , then moves the sample - holder as to position the probe above a ﬁxed RBC . The planar motion of the nanostage is then artiﬁcially blocked and the user controls only the z motion until the probe touches the cell and he feels an obvious counter - force . The experimental results are shown in Figure 5 . A . Small ﬂuctuations are caused by the 3D Brownian motion of probe which are largely present at the considered scale . The contact point is shown in region II in ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) . At contact , a sudden reaction force in the z - axis of about 0 . 3 pN is detected , and the Brownian motion is attenuated compared to the region I . Then the probe is pushed deeper into the cell until 1 . 6 pN in the z - direction , as shown in III . At this time , user felt about 1 . 6 N force in the z - axis . The cell is contacted twice during the presented experiment . Similar results are obtained during the two passes which also proves the repeatability of the axial force detection . Notice that this experiment aims to validate the axial haptic feedback during biological manipulations . In addition , the stiffness of the RBCs can be roughly obtained from the result . By using the Hertz model , which considers the cell a homogeneous smooth semi - sphere , the elastic modulus of the RBC is calculated as 33 . 7 Pa [ 29 ] . This result is similar to literature , with the measure of the elastic modulus of ad - herent living cells [ 30 ] . This is an approximated result ; for a proper mechanical characterization , the trap stiffness should be calibrated in the neighborhood of the cell before [ 31 ] . The system would also allow to automatize the experiment and to repeat it accurately over a large number of trials . 2 ) 3D Haptic Exploration : This experiment is dedicated to touch the 3D contour of cells and explore their shapes . The difﬁculty of these tasks comes from the uncertainty contour of the biological objects . Since the visual information may be blurry or lost at some parts , the haptic feedback will help users to maintain the contact and decrease the possibility of losing the trap . This experiment is dedicated to let a user touch the 3D contour of cells and explore their shapes . The difﬁculty of these tasks comes from the uncertainty and irregularity of biological objects . Since the visual information is blurry and lacks the depth of ﬁeld , and the probe is eventually occluded by the sample itself , the haptic feedback would help to maintain the contact . First , 2 ﬂat and transparent RBCs , damaged after the hemoglobin leakage , stuck together forming a ∞ shape is explored ( ﬁg . 5 . B ) . Another experiment is conducted on a isolated RBC ( ﬁg . 5 . C ) . The 3D contact force is successfully perceived and maintained by operators . Haptic feedback allows to keep the contact even when the probe is occluded and users were able to achieve a surface exploration with consistent force feedback . 1892 B .

The scale bars are 3 µ m . 3 ) Preliminary user evaluations : To further prove the repeatability and effectiveness of the 3D haptic feedback during biological manipulations , a preliminary users study is conducted . 6 volunteers explored the shape of one identical RBC . Each were subject to those three different conditions : with only vision feedback , both vision and haptic feedback , and only haptic feedback respectively . Before the formal evaluation , the participants were trained to use the system for about 10 minutes and shown how to trap microbeads to serve as probes . They were than asked to roll the probe around the cell while keeping the contact at all times . The task under each condition was conducted twice . The probe trajectory during three users’ experiments are depicted in Fig . 6 ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) . During this experiment , it is observed that exploration with only haptic information is time - consuming . Users are required more to concentrate on the force feedback hence move slowly . Full exploration is successfully completed only in half of the trials . Due to the lack of vision information , the users can hardly estimate the path to follow . With only vision feedback , users frequently lose the trapped object ( 33 % ) because of large contact forces difﬁcult to infer from vision alone . This is also probably caused by some shadows and invisible features that are barely noticed . Combining the haptic feedback and vision overcomes the above shortages . Vision provides general overview infor - mation of the scene and haptic feedback allows for ﬁne control skills . The haptic feedback largely decreases the rate of losing trap to 17 % and users performs the task more efﬁciently . Note however that this is a preliminary qualitative analysis . A formal user evaluation comparing both modalities is planned . IV . CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK We have presented a new method for 3D force sensing for Optical Tweezers , with high bandwidth ( up to 10Khz ) , in a large three - dimensional workspace that covers the full linear domain of a single trapped bead and pico - newton sensibility with a theoretical resolution of 0 , 3pN . The force sensing is based on high - speed optical processing implemented through a silicon retina and its dedicated tracking algorithm . ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) EndStart HapticVisionH + V Lost Fig . 6 .

The scale bar is 3 µ m 1893 Thanks to the capabilities of force sensing , and because of the stable and simple set - up design , complex tasks have been demonstrated in real biological environment on a haptic teleoperation platform . This is a good illustration of the kind of new robotic application that can beneﬁt from the proposed 3D sensing . A simple user study has shown that non - expert user can take in hand the optical tweezers after few minutes of training . It is safe to assume that expert user will be able to perform complex tasks more efﬁciently . The real - time particle - tracking scheme can be also ex - tended to magnetic tweezers and other micro - robotics tech - niques . The method remains compatible with ﬂuorescence , interferential and superresolution microscopy . An interesting development would be a Scanning Force Microscopy tech - nique adapted to biological environments . In future works , we plan to extend this fast 3D force sens - ing capabilities to several trapped objects . Current state - of - the - art of multi - trap optical tweezers usually do not include force sensing capabilities [ 32 ] . Multi - trap optical tweezers or optically actuated microtools [ 33 ] with highly transparent force feedback will be advantageous for numerous biomed - ical applications . R EFERENCES [ 1 ] J . R .
