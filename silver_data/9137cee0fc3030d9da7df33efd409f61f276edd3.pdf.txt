While traditional means of co - design are primarily local and in - person , recent research has pointed to the need to consider co - design with children in online spaces [ 22 , 36 , 54 , 63 , 71 – 73 , 76 , 77 ] . More recently from 2020 to 2022 , COVID - 19 shifted co - design on - line to the forefront [ 22 , 36 , 54 , 76 ] . A number of papers have shown the need for adapting to co - design online with children [ 36 ] , with special interest to whole body interactions [ 54 ] and socio - emotional experiences in remote co - design [ 76 ] . However , this recent online co - design research has only focused on the evaluation of engage - ments over a series of short term projects , rather than across a single design over time . For instance , Lee et al . [ 36 ] developed a conceptual model of improvisation in children’s online co - design from analysis of 10 sessions across several design projects . Similarly , Fails et al . ’s [ 22 ] comparison of three online co - design sites stud - ied the process of co - design online during COVID - 19 , but had no emphasis on what was designed . While COVID - 19 created a need for children’s co - design online , the corresponding participatory design ( PD ) methodology has been understudied . We have little to no knowledge of online co - design techniques as they pertain to lon - gitudinal work . Meanwhile , past in - person longitudinal co - design projects resulted in new design theories , methods , and techniques [ 19 , 20 , 79 , 81 ] . For instance , the International Digital Children’s Library [ 19 – 21 ] and Science Everywhere [ 1 , 2 , 12 , 46 , 79 , 81 ] are two examples of co - designing with children for a period of months and years on a single project . Both research designs engaged in exten - sive work with children as users , testers , informants , and design partners [ 1 , 21 ] . Inspired by these online short - term and in - person longitudinal co - design works , we set out to explore the longitudinal online co - design context with children . The shift to remote collaboration presents challenges to online co - designers as certain in - person co - design techniques become limited ; especially physically proximal activities such as crafting prototypes , acting out scenarios , and movement games to generate ideas . Therefore , remote interaction presents barriers for children’s creative and collaborative expression , motivating us to explore a technical intervention to improve physical collaborations in online co - design . Building on work that studied tabletop telepresence robots for physical telepresence in remote collaboration [ 39 , 62 ] , we set out to co - design this technology for children . During this longitudinal online co - design , we explored two research questions : ( 1 ) What kinds of opportunities and challenges emerge in a long - term online co - design process of a single product ? and ( 2 ) How does children’s long - term design and use of a tabletop telepresence robot collaboration platform impact online co - design processes ? We studied these questions across approximately two years with 13 children ( ages 8 - 12 ) at the KidsTeam UW intergenerational par - ticipatory design ( PD ) team through design prompts centering the telepresence robots ( Sony Toio ) , which children controlled in near - real time through a web application . Our findings , situated in the unique longitudinal online co - design context , show three major themes around how ( 1 ) the technical space of online co - design presents persistent challenges , while the addition of the robots in - creases collaboration and shared - ownership of physical projects ; ( 2 ) the social landscape of longitudinal online co - design in children’s home affords both distraction and inspiration , while adding robots to the home facilitated social connections and playfulness between co - designers ; and ( 3 ) the need to give children flexibility to adapt their use of co - design methods and techniques over time , including the versatility that emerged in children’s use of the robots . These findings support previously identified characteristics of online co - design [ 22 , 36 ] , while contributing insights about the progression of these characteristics over a long - term collaboration and the strategies that emerged to adapt to the unique qualities of online co - design with children . We also present a conceptual model of lon - gitudinal online co - design that describes the interplay between the design of the technology ( tabletop telepresence robots ) and online co - design processes . We then identify and discuss opportunities for further research of longitudinal online co - design , including the generation of new PD methods , techniques , and theories . 2 LITERATURE REVIEW 2 . 1 Children as Design Partners in Online Spaces Participatory design ( PD ) centers the collaborative and democratic engagement of users in the design process [ 17 , 31 ] . Inclusion of users in the design process can both empower users [ 83 ] , and pro - duce viable designs [ 1 , 20 ] . Similarly , co - design refers to how ex - perts work directly with end - users to solve a specific design prob - lem . Our project specifically utilized a PD method called Coopera - tive Inquiry [ 20 , 83 ] . Druin developed Cooperative Inquiry as a way for children and adults to be equitable and equal design partners [ 19 , 20 ] . Children are experts at being children , and co - designing with them results in design products that fit within the childhood experience and context . However , despite children’s knowledge , it does take time and effort to sustain relationships with them and build their design expertise [ 83 ] . Therefore , researchers utilizing Cooperative Inquiry often work closely with a smaller group of children over a longer period of time [ 19 ] . Researchers engaged in Cooperative Inquiry often study the development of design tech - niques to support balanced design between children and adults [ 81 , 83 ] . A design technique is a series of activities that help de - signers communicate and collaborate with users [ 75 ] . Walsh et al . [ 75 ] notes that technique selection and development help designers consider the opportunities , challenges , and design constraints of each approach for their application . Many co - designs with children occur in labs [ 83 ] , libraries [ 35 , 80 , 82 ] , schools [ 13 , 24 , 45 , 57 ] , community centers [ 16 – 18 ] , and refugee camps [ 3 ] . Online , researchers have explored PD on social media sites like Facebook [ 41 ] or game spaces like Minecraft 53 Designing Together , Miles Apart : A Longitudinal Tabletop Telepresence Adventure in Online Co - Design with Children IDC ’23 , June 19 – 23 , 2023 , Chicago , IL , USA [ 71 , 72 ] . Additionally , some researchers have looked at asynchro - nous remote communities—through team chat protocols like Slack or Discord—as a way to encourage participation of distributed populations [ 7 , 41 , 44 ] . Since March 2020 and the emergence of COVID - 19 , more research with children and PD exists now in the online space , relying on Zoom calls for online co - design [ 22 , 77 ] . Researchers use such platforms to create techniques for whole - body interaction online [ 54 ] , and facilitate children’s co - design around socio - emotional experiences [ 76 ] . More recently , Lee et al . ’s [ 36 ] research focused on HCI improvi - sation as a way to make sense of online co - design considerations . They explored how online co - design interactions are about man - aging and taking risks , particularly when remote settings lead to a lack of clarity , certainty , and structure . Synchronous co - design online puts design partners in numerous challenges and pitfalls . Through HCI improvisation , online co - design can be seen as invit - ing new ways to be exploratory ( reflexivity ) , flexible ( transgression ) , and nuanced ( tensions ) ; considering how situations change quickly ( listening ) , and understanding the context of the situation ( inter - dependence ) . While we have learned much about online co - design with children and adults in recent years due to COVID - 19 , there is a gap - in - knowledge to consider . Lee et al . [ 36 ] and other remote co - design studies [ 22 , 54 , 63 , 71 – 73 , 76 , 77 ] focus much of their analysis of online interactions on piecemeal shorter - term projects . That is , none of the studies and interactions in online co - design set out on a specific longer - term project with frequent iterations , testing , and incremental improvements over time . Shorter term projects online include one to two sessions [ 76 ] , or multiple ( three to five ) online workshops [ 36 , 44 , 74 , 77 ] . However , within the IDC and HCI space , there is a tradition of studying co - design longitudinally , as the design process can be more deeply understood given the length of time it takes for a design team to become skilled with the methods and techniques . For instance , the work of the International Digital Children’s Library ( ICDL ) [ 19 – 21 ] and Science Everywhere [ 1 , 2 , 12 , 46 , 79 , 81 ] focused on co - design projects that took place over years to generate new theories and methods about co - design [ 19 , 20 , 79 , 81 ] . Online collaborations and co - design are more recent innovations , and we found no related studies that looked at projects taking place over a longer duration ( months to years ) . Therefore , it is difficult to understand the specific nuances of online co - design as children develop over time . For this study , we examined 20 online / hybrid sessions ( Appendix A . 2 ) with children over two years to design a tabletop telepresence robot interface . 2 . 2 Telepresence for Remote Collaboration with Children Prior work in HCI has explored how challenging co - working on tangible objects can be when teams are not co - located [ 9 ] . While synchronous video brings improvement to communication [ 32 ] especially when the task - space is visible on camera [ 8 ] , it remains limited , especially for physically distant teams conducting creative work . Technology designs for remote collaboration have primarily focused on facilitating two key elements of successful creative work : social presence and shared context . Social presence interventions enable bodily presence within remote co - working spaces , facilitat - ing the exchange of relational cues between coworkers’ to build trust [ 37 ] . For example , telepresence robots have been used in a vari - ety of configurations to provide shared presence within co - working environments [ 4 , 69 ] . This approach has been shown to improve a user’s sense of social presence – for both the party represented by a robot and the party interacting with the robotic actor [ 55 , 61 ] . Meanwhile , the lack of spatial cues in video conferencing makes it difficult to communicate and ideate with physical artifacts , reducing the effectiveness of remote co - working sessions [ 64 ] . Shared con - text interventions facilitate the shared understanding of objects and spaces of interest to remote co - working tasks . Previous research has explored the use of shared virtual spaces [ 26 , 34 ] , alternative camera and video placement [ 50 ] , behavioral interventions [ 23 , 29 ] , robots [ 51 , 53 ] , and actuated devices [ 9 , 38 ] to create shared context through alternative representations of physical objects . Considering the importance of social presence and shared con - text in online collaboration , prior work has explored how tabletop robots could support such needs during remote synchronous work . For instance , RobotPHONE created an actuated tangible element for users to communicate shapes during co - working , providing a shared representation for remote collaborators to see and feel each other’s work [ 62 ] . Another project , ASTEROIDS , utilized tabletop swarm robots with attached cameras to allow remote users interact with the work of an instructor on a workbench scale [ 39 ] . Through this responsive , real time engagement , teams are able to build trust and shared understanding . Either through a shared representation , in the case of RobotPHONE or through distributed tabletop robots , in the case of ASTEROIDS . Previous works have also explored how children might engage in more meaningful video conferencing with technologies that support social presence [ 10 , 70 ] and shared context [ 30 , 56 , 78 ] . Such platforms , primarily explored in educational and familial set - tings , employed similar strategies to telepresence platforms built for adults’ physical design collaboration , while considering the unique technical obstacles and social context of children . For ex - ample , ShareTable [ 78 ] , a project designed to connect families from divorced households , provided users with an alternative viewpoint through a tabletop video feed and projection . Users could draw pictures on the same table , read books , or play games together , creating an increased sense of connection and expression . Tsoi et . al . designed a system that allowed users to log into an application to control the movements of a Vector commercial robot located in a child’s home to explore remote synchronous communication [ 68 ] . Tele - operators could see the live camera stream from the robot , and actuate the robot through a variety of controls . This project primarily focused on using the robots to enable social presence between children and their friends and family . Inspired by these works that improved remote communication and collaboration for children , and by tabletop telepresence tech - nologies that facilitate both shared context and social presence in remote collaboration , we identified a tabletop robot platform that would adapt well to our context – Sony Toio . These commercially available robot toys with developer support have previously been used to build haptic and tangible tabletop interfaces [ 48 , 49 , 67 ] . In our work , we explore how the Toio tabletop robots might be used for synchronous communication in online co - design with children . 54 IDC ’23 , June 19 – 23 , 2023 , Chicago , IL , USA Hunt , et al . 3 METHODS 3 . 1 Case Study For this paper , we employed the case study method [ 43 ] to examine a single co - design project from March 2020 to May 2022 . We inves - tigated the two - year project at KidsTeam UW , an intergenerational co - design team of children and adults affiliated with a higher edu - cation institution [ 83 ] . This exploration is unique in three aspects . First , KidsTeam UW is an extreme case in both context and makeup . During the COVID - 19 pandemic , most of the world was locked down in a once - in - a - lifetime event , forcing everyone to interact in mostly online spaces . This unique circumstance allowed us to exam - ine our project in a remote PD team that had gone online during the COVID - 19 lockdown . Second , this project is a revelatory case as it spanned 26 months , providing a unique opportunity to observe and analyze the understudied phenomenon of online co - design with children . Finally , the longitudinal characteristic of the project at KidsTeam UW demonstrated how situations and processes change over time on a single design and allowed us an in - depth understand - ing of how engagements unfolded in PD sessions that influenced the final design . We chose to work with KidsTeam UW to co - design the tabletop robot platform and evaluate longitudinal online co - design experiences of children during COVID - 19 because the group had already established the participants , logistics , and resources to support a long term online co - design project . The KidsTeam UW cohort we worked with in this project consisted of a PD team of 13 children ( ages 8 - 12 ) , 7 designers and researchers ( child - computer interaction , computer science , product design ) , and 24 adult vol - unteers for a total of 44 co - designers across 4 time zones and 5 institutions . 3 . 2 Contexts and Participants KidsTeam UW occurred online from March 2020 to May 2022 . We chose children ages 8 - 12 because this age group is developmentally ready for co - design but still able to be child - like ( see Recruitment of Participants statement ) . We recruited for diversity in ethnicity , socioeconomic status , gender , and age to gain multiple perspectives . Overall , 13 different children participated in KidsTeam UW for this case study ( Appendix A . 1 ) . Adults in the core group consisted of researchers—in computer science , design , and child - computer interaction— alongside undergraduate and graduate students . All adults ( including researchers ) worked with the children as design partners in close collaboration online . Across these online co - design sessions , we explored designs for and / or with the robot platform with a variety of co - design techniques ( Appendix A . 2 ) . We used three platforms to facilitate this online collaboration . First , we used Zoom video as both children and adults were familiar with the platform from online schooling during lockdown . Second , we used Google Slides as our main collaboration tool due to its free access for children . Finally , adults used Discord to communicate with each other behind - the - scenes during and between design sessions . Each of the 20 co - design sessions began with Welcome Time ( 15 minutes ) , in which children and adults gathered together to talk and socialize . During this time , we implemented the introductory activity of Question of the Day to prime everyone to think about the session goals . Then , facilitators presented the design prompt for the day . Design prompts were selected to either ( 1 ) utilize the robots for a shared design activity or ( 2 ) design the robot control platform . During Design Time ( 45 minutes ) , designers interacted together in Zoom breakout rooms ( 2 children , 2 - 3 adults ) using PD techniques online [ 36 , 75 ] to create artifacts , evaluate co - design technologies , and explore activities with the telepresence robots . One or two adults stayed behind as the “eagle eyes” to watch all of the breakout rooms and take care of logistics , such as troubleshooting Internet problems . Finally , in Discussion Time ( 15 minutes ) we gathered everyone together in a single Zoom room to present designs , make final suggestions , reflect on the activity of the day , and propose new activities ( e . g . , sports , dancing , and drawing ) to generate future session ideas . 4 DESIGN CONTEXT : TABLETOP TELEPRESENCE ROBOT SYSTEM DESIGN ITERATIONS 4 . 1 Physical Setup During the transition to online during the COVID - 19 lockdown , the children in KidsTeam UW used various family - owned devices to attend the sessions . This led to inconsistencies regarding cam - era quality , screen size , and input capability . Additionally , because some children found it challenging or uncomfortable to use a front - facing camera , they turned videos off ; which sometimes resulted in them disengaging entirely from the sessions . So , we redesigned the technology setup using Cooperative Inquiry to help children’s engagement and participation in the sessions . As a result of this pro - cess , we provided each child a Surface tablet and custom 3D printed stand and flip mirror ( Fig . 2a ) . This setup enabled children to share their workspace over video , while leaving them the option to opt - in to front - facing camera use . Once children were familiar with the tablet and mirrored stand , we introduced Sony Toio robots ( two per KidsTeam UW member ) . The robots support relative and absolute control using techniques similar to Anoto pen—when used with a provided play mat—and encourage low tech modifications with their blank - slate design . Robots are connected via Web Bluetooth to a web - based control interface ( Fig . 2b ) . Children can control their robots locally or connect to remote robots via a WebSocket . The on - screen controls allow children to move the robots using an on - screen joystick , on - screen absolute position control , and expression buttons ( spin , shuffle , party ) . Or , children can enable a mirrored connection , where the remote Toio replicates the absolute position detected from the local Toio . 4 . 2 Software We used a web platform to enable adults and children to design the on - screen robot control interface , and see those designs reflected through regular updates to the application . The design of the UI took place over three phases . Throughout this three - phase design pro - cess , we integrated children’s feedback which we collected through dialogue , sketches , and observation . In the first phase ( sessions 1 - 7 ) , we introduced the robots to children with a relative control system to move local and remote robots . During this phase , we started with directional buttons only ( front , right , back , left ) , and asked children to provide design ideas for the control interface . As a result of children’s design ideas and sketches , we added a joystick 55 Designing Together , Miles Apart : A Longitudinal Tabletop Telepresence Adventure in Online Co - Design with Children IDC ’23 , June 19 – 23 , 2023 , Chicago , IL , USA ( a ) ( b ) Figure 2 : ( a ) Tablet computer with mirror , stand , tabletop play area ( b ) Schematic of Telepresence Robot Connection and speed control to enable finer robot movement . Moreover , chil - dren proposed adding buttons with pre - programmed movements that they could use for expressions , in response we introduced spin , party , and shuffle buttons to the app . Our objective in phase one was to familiarize children with tele - operation of the robots and refine the relative robot control interface . In the second phase ( ses - sions 8 - 15 ) , we added the use of absolute position control to the system . In phase two , our objective was to explore the impact of absolute position control on children’s tele - operation of the robots , and work with them to refine the absolute control interface . The absolute control scheme enabled users to click on a location on the screen to move the robot to a corresponding position on the play mat . In this phase , we also introduced the mirrored control , where a remote robot replicates the position of a local robot . Children reported liking that they could see the position of the remote ro - bot via the UI , which they used to supplement their knowledge of the robot position from Zoom video . During this phase , children also reported that managing two windows for Zoom video calls and robot control was challenging . As a result , we co - designed an integrated video layout in session 15 . During the third and final phase ( sessions 15 - 20 ) , we implemented the suggestions from the previous sessions to create a controller with an integrated video conferencing system . Thereby eliminating the need for children to switch between the control application and Zoom . We also added notifications for remote control events based on children’s con - cerns about the accountability of remote operators . During remote control , the application indicates the remote user name and their actions to the robot owner . The resulting system incorporates chil - dren’s preferences and design ideas to produce a tabletop robot tele - operation interface for online co - design with children . 5 DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Video data : We used Zoom video chat to record video and audio data from the main room and breakout rooms from each session . In total , we collected 100 + hours of video across the 20 sessions . Transcripts from the sessions were auto - generated from Zoom , we then reviewed these transcripts for accuracy and fixed any transcription errors . Artifacts : We used Google Slides to collect artifacts from the children . Such artifacts included hand - drawn or digitally created prototypes produced during co - design sessions , children’s perspec - tives on proposed interface designs and prototypes , and digital notes from the adults . To capture documentation of children’s phys - ical designs , adults asked children to hold up their designs on video so they could capture screenshots of the artifacts to add to Google Slides . Data Analysis : To understand our long - term online co - design process , we started with an open inductive analytical process and grounded methods [ 11 ] . We created analytic memos to analyze the videos in Spring 2022 [ 59 ] . Primary and secondary reviewers began by watching all of the videos . Initially , primary reviewers wrote up memos about the interactions in 10 minute segments . After the primary reviewers finished the first round of memoing [ 59 ] , a secondary reviewer watched the videos and reviewed the primary reviewer’s initial memo . The secondary reviewer added any missing interactions and additional information to the memos . We asked both primary and secondary reviewers to note any interactions they thought were pertinent to our analysis , such as what kinds of collaborations occurred , what kinds of designs were created , and how children and adults interacted online . After we generated memos for the 20 co - design sessions , we open coded them in Spring 2022 . We began with codes such as sib - ling dynamics , difficulties with Internet and Bluetooth connections , challenges with robots , future design ideas for the robots , the use of physical materials in online co - design , any novelty effect , practice effect , and / or fatigue in co - designing with the robots , and trou - bleshooting online in co - design . For the coding process , we relied on the same primary and secondary analytic memo writers . Pri - mary coders started coding with the initial codebook and justified each code . Throughout the process , coders were given the chance to add , delete , and edit the initial codebook . After the primary coders completed the first round of coding , secondary coders reviewed primary codes . Through consensus coding [ 42 ] , secondary coders put + 1 for agreements or - 1 for disagreements , explaining their rea - sonings . Disagreements about coding were resolved by the research group through interrater consensus [ 42 ] . Instead of quantitative counts , we chose to do consensus coding to negotiate and consider the richness of the qualitative data collaboratively [ 28 ] . 56 IDC ’23 , June 19 – 23 , 2023 , Chicago , IL , USA Hunt , et al . Our open coding and consensus coding spanned 10 group meet - ings from Spring to Summer 2022 . Through axial coding and the - matic generation [ 11 ] , we created two main coding categories in our codebook : ( 1 ) Co - design processes ( collaboration : child - to - child , adult - to - child , adult - to - adult , siblings at home ) ; communication ( feedback , satisfaction , frustration ) ; troubleshooting ( infrastructure , robot design ) and iteration ; and ( 2 ) Technology innovation ( tech - nology maintenance , exploration of 2 - D , 3 - D spaces , frustration with Toio , satisfaction with Toio , collaboration opportunities with Toio ) . We coded all the session transcripts with iterative discussions and updates to the codebook , while identifying key themes that emerged during this process . Finally , we selected example vignettes as a way to demonstrate snapshots of the participants’ characters , experiences , and composites to convey the particular purpose of the themes [ 65 ] . 6 FINDINGS In this section , we present three themes that emerged from the interplay of long - term online co - design processes and the tabletop telepresence system we designed . When discussing the findings , we refer to mixed groups of adults and children as “co - designers” . 6 . 1 Theme 1 : The Technology Space Over Time For Theme 1 , we describe the impact of the technology space on long - term online co - design : the challenges that arose from chil - dren’s role as technology managers , and how they were notable and consistent parts of the process , even as children became profi - cient with the technologies used during our longitudinal co - design engagement . Then , we address the expanded technology space with the addition of the telepresence robots and its impact on children’s experiences of physical prototyping online . 6 . 1 . 1 Online co - design processes : Navigating unexpected technical is - sues over time . Constructing the online co - design technology space ( e . g . , the Zoom “room” , robots , Google Slides ) relied on the tech - nical knowledge , collaboration , and commitment of both children and adults . Despite our efforts to ensure the consistency of the co - design technology space by providing tablets and telepresence robots , and using a standardized Zoom configuration , technical troubleshooting remained a significant hurdle in online sessions . Notably , these issues sprang out of children’s varied and morphing use of the provided tablets ( Vignette 1 ) . Such variability meant that both troubleshooting efforts and design considerations for the telep - resence robot control application needed to account for children’s individual setup . As a result of these varied setups , troubleshooting required significant efforts from adults and children . Vignette 2 presents a sample interaction between Katelyn , Desirae , and Isaac where they used an unexpected approach , showing a reflection of their screen with the provided flip mirror , to share the configuration of their Zoom window and robot control application . Example Vignette 1 . During early sessions , children consistently used standardized Surface tablet devices without issues . However , some children became re - luctant to use these devices over time , even when specifically prompted to . Or , in the case that a child made use of the provided tablets throughout the study , they customized the device configuration and used the provided devices in unexpected ways . For example , Desirae and Katelyn utilized the screen tiling settings to display both the Zoom call and robot controls simul - taneously on the tablet . Andreas switched between Zoom and the online robot control application , as he found tiling windows on the provided tablets confus - ing . Avery used the tablet for robot control but joined Zoom from a separate device . Example Vignette 2 . When Isaac asked Desirae about her screen configuration during session 7 , she used her flip mirror to show a reflection of the screen ( Fig . 3a ) . She used this work - around since she could not use screen share on Zoom to show the Zoom win - dow . When Desirae initially showed Isaac her screen , she had configured the Zoom window as an overlay on the robot controls . When asked about whether she used this setup when controlling Isaac’s robots remotely , Desirae responded by showing a tiled view ( Zoom on the left , and the robot control application on the right ) . The group went on to discuss the bene - fits and downsides of each screen configuration , with Desirae providing feedback about how the web app could be improved to be more useful to her in the tiled view . 6 . 1 . 2 Design innovation : Tangible collaboration in online co - design . The longitudinal aspect of the project presented an opportunity to habituate children to technology designs that would be unwieldy for them to use in a short - term study . In the beginning , children and adults were overwhelmed by the multi - level technical setup . As children’s confidence managing the technology increased over time , we started using the robots as part of physical design activities . This change extended the technology space of online co - design from visual to tangible , which changed the character of physical design collaborations . Prior to the addition of the robots , children—who were asked to create physical prototypes with craft materials dur - ing online sessions—were primarily focused on their own designs , working in parallel with little cross - collaboration . In contrast , when children used the robots during physical prototyping , they spent significant time discussing and responding to peer’s design ideas , and held a sense of ownership in the designs they contributed to remotely ( Vignette 3 ) . Meanwhile , since tele - operation of the robots required a video stream , we found that children were more likely to leave their video on during sessions involving the robots , re - sulting in their designs being more frequently visible to remote collaborators . This increased visibility provided adults with more opportunities to comment and ask questions about children’s moti - vations and design process . Example Vignette 3 . In session 4 , we asked partici - pants to design a maze for the robots to move marbles to a target location . During this process , Sonja and Harper provided feedback about the design of the stage Andrea had built . This feedback emerged from their use of the tele - operated robot to play with the marble maze in Andrea’s space . In response , the group discussed ways to make the maze easier , and ways to make the robots more effective at moving marbles . 57 Designing Together , Miles Apart : A Longitudinal Tabletop Telepresence Adventure in Online Co - Design with Children IDC ’23 , June 19 – 23 , 2023 , Chicago , IL , USA This vignette illustrates the interconnectedness of our project’s focus on designing the tangible online co - design space ( through modifications to the robots and the way they are controlled ) , while also utilizing our technology as a tool for remote physical prototyping . Sonja : [ tele - operating Andrea’s robot ] “Why are all the marbles in the corner , that makes it hard ! ” Andrea : “Do you think any attachments to the robot would be helpful right now ? ” Harper : “Maybe like a scoop thingy , a shovel ? ” 6 . 2 Theme 2 : Social Landscape of Long - Term Online Co - Design While in - person co - design is typically hosted in a single location , online co - design sessions are distributed by nature , and expand the design space to include individual’s settings [ 22 ] . During our project , we observed that children primarily joined KidsTeam UW from their home . This setting impacted the social aspects of online co - design , changing children’s engagement in the session and the way bonds were built between co - designers . Meanwhile , the telep - resence robots also improved the social characteristics of online co - design , inviting co - designers connect in new ways as a result of their physical presence in the home . 6 . 2 . 1 Online co - design processes : Home context over time . The home context played two roles in the social aspects of online co - design : distraction and inspiration . For distraction , children were subjected to factors at home outside of the design session , com - peting for their attention [ 22 ] . In several sessions , Avery opted to prepare food in her kitchen instead of engaging in the activi - ties . And Brooklynn , who reported preferring online to in - person co - design , frequently stepped away during sessions . In these mo - ments of distraction , adults tried to regain children’s focus , asking probing questions about the design prompt or questioning whether the children were still available . However , children had varied or sometimes no responses to these questions . In a sense , the forward progression of the online co - design sessions was heavily dictated by children’s home environment , and was sometimes outside of the adults’ influence . On the other hand , the inclusion of children’s home environ - ments in the social landscape of online co - design consistently of - fered unique opportunities for co - designers to find inspiration . For example , co - designers frequently discussed their home set - ting , which allowed them to learn about each other’s home life over time . This led to children’s designs relating to their home lives ( Vignette 4 ) . With adults sometimes even prompting design ideas by asking children to consider the pets , rooms , or families that they had shared in previous sessions ( Vignette 5 ) . Example Vignette 4 . From the beginning of the project , Brooklynn consistently worked next to her 3 - year - old sister during online co - design sessions , re - sulting in facilitators and other children making a con - nection with Brooklynn’s sister . In session 13 , when asked about what buttons she would add to the robot interface , Brooklynn proposed creating a way for the robot to monitor her sister , who could not go to sleep . She proposed a robot that turns into a walkie - talkie that would sing lullabies to her sister , allow her to watch her sister sleeping , and alert her when her sister woke up . Example Vignette 5 . Sonja and Avery adopted a puppy at the beginning of the project . The puppy was frequently shown on video during co - design sessions . In session 7 , to inspire new ideas when the conver - sation about designing controllers for the robots had gotten stale , Logan reminded Avery about the family dog she introduced previously , and asked whether they could design a controller for canines . To achieve this , the group adapted one of the dog’s toys into a way to move the robot , proposing a steering wheel that would be able to control the telepresence robots to gather all the dog’s toys . 6 . 2 . 2 Design Innovation : Enabling new connections and play with physical telepresence . We found that the telepresence robots ex - panded online co - designer’s interactions with each other in their home context in a tangible and playful way . In conventional online co - design where one person talks at once , while others remain silent to prevent cross talk , the robots’ physicality provided an addi - tional interaction channel besides the video call for children . When the robots were added , we found children consistently used them to engage with others in silly ways ( Vignette 6 ) . Also , because the addi - tion of the robots allowed co - designers to interact with each - other’s spaces directly , both adults and children naturally incorporated arti - facts from their home on - the - fly when playing with them ( Vignette 7 ) . This physicality and incorporation of co - designer’s personal belongings and home spaces sparked conversations around their personalities and preferences , and increased the groups’ sense of connection compared to sessions without the robots . Example Vignette 6 . In session 1 , after learning about robot’s telepresence functionality , Andreas specifically requested to connect to the robots on the facilitator’s desk , exclaiming “I want to connect to your robots ! ” In spite of the robots not being visible on camera ( only audio of the robots moving is heard through the video call ) , Andreas enjoyed being able to playfully move the facilitator’s robots . Once con - nected , Andreas joked about his use of the robots , “I must connect , I will destroy you ! ” Example Vignette 7 . Co - designers commonly incor - porated personal items when using the robots ( Fig . 3c ) . In session 8 , Tyler ( adult ) added knick - knacks to her play mat and encouraged Sonja , Theo , and Avery to try to moving them with the robots in order to practice a new control scheme . The group cooperated to push heavier items and even discussed the origin of the more interesting artifacts . In session 1 , Sonja covered her robot with a cup when she became frustrated with the other children who were tele - operating her robot ( Fig . 3b ) . As a result of this action , the co - designers in this breakout group discussed the potential dis - comfort of allowing a tele - operated robot into their 58 IDC ’23 , June 19 – 23 , 2023 , Chicago , IL , USA Hunt , et al .

Early in our project , this unpredictability created gridlock when children were unprepared for the planned design activity . However , we found that co - designers were more successful and effective when they had autonomy over their co - design process , including how they chose to utilize the robot , instead of following a prescribed approach in response to the design prompt . 6 . 3 . 1 Online co - design processes : Adaptation in online co - design with flexible methods . Online co - design comes with variability and unpredictability [ 36 ] . We often observed children joining the ses - sion from different places ( e . g . , a moving car , or their bed ) and devices ( e . g . , mobile phones ) that limited their engagement in on - screen prototyping , craft activities or telepresence robot use . Facing such uncertainties challenged the planned activities , commonly re - sulting in bottlenecks and frustration among co - designers ( Vignette 8 ) . To cope , we progressively allowed co - designers more autonomy in selecting co - design techniques , rather than prescribing a specific approach . Leveraging their accumulated and diverse experiences with design tools over the course of the project , co - designers were able to adapt strategies that worked best in their variable contexts . With such methodological flexibility , co - designers moved through design prompts more effectively , preventing lost time as a result of adults and children trying to work with a co - design technique that was mismatched with children’s capabilities . This strategy also re - centered children’s role from technical troubleshooters back to designers , allowing them to engage in sessions even if their tech - nology was not working as expected . While this deconstruction of design sessions posed the risk of unwieldy complexity and un - focused outcomes , it resulted in co - designers spending more time designing and less time feeling frustrated as a result of technical issues or missing materials ( Vignette 9 ) . Example Vignette 8 . In session 5 , we asked groups to design and test a robot attachment prototype that could hold a pen to enable drawing using craft ma - terials . However , this task required children to have ( 1 ) a charged robot , ( 2 ) suitable prototyping materi - als , ( 3 ) access to the web application , ( 4 ) a successful Bluetooth link between the app and the robot , and ( 5 ) a functional pen attachment prototype . Due to such complexity , teams spent the majority of the session troubleshooting their technology and trying to get a pen to attach to the robots , rather than co - designing . When children shared their experience of this session , Avery said that she did not understand the purpose of the activity , Andreas gave a thumbs down , and Cal said he hated spending the session troubleshooting the system . Example Vignette 9 . In session 10 , we asked chil - dren to brainstorm emotions that the robots could express without specifying the teams’ choice of de - sign approach to complete this task . As a result , some children controlled robots via the on - screen inter - face , some puppeteered them with their hands , some moved their bodies to demonstrate the emotion , some participated in verbal discussion , and some created a collage of pictures depicting the intended emotions in Google Slides . Instead of getting stuck on meeting the requirements to complete a specified design method , groups were able to adapt to their team’s preparation , environment , and preferences . As a result , we col - lected a wide variety of design ideas about emotional expression with the robots during this session . 6 . 3 . 2 Design innovation : Telepresence robots as a flexible , shared point of interest . Over time , the robots emerged as a flexible tool , with co - designers opting to adapt their use of them to suit their per - sonal preferences and the design prompt . Over the study , we asked children to design stages , costumes , stories , movements , games , and attachments for the robots . With time , children developed pref - erences about which of these techniques they preferred . When our facilitation strategy of co - design sessions became more flexi - ble about the co - design technique applied , children also gravitated toward a more varied use of the robots ( Vignette 9 ) . In addition , because all children had identical robots , and robots were a cen - tral tool in the sessions , they emerged shared point of focus . This shared focus on the robots along with their telepresence function - ality resulted in co - design groups creating unique designs . In one case , imagining how a story could be told across multiple locations ( Vignette 10 ) . In another , utilizing the unexpected movement of the robot as inspiration for new features of the robot control interface ( Vignette 11 ) . 59 Designing Together , Miles Apart : A Longitudinal Tabletop Telepresence Adventure in Online Co - Design with Children IDC ’23 , June 19 – 23 , 2023 , Chicago , IL , USA Example Vignette 10 . In session 14 , we asked chil - dren to create stories with the telepresence robots . One group explored how the “stage” of the robots could extend across multiple children’s homes . In their story a child ( represented by a robot ) falls through an interdimensional portal in Raj’s house . Raj explained , “So here’s Michael , and then he sees this portal . Then he touches it . Then he accidentally slipped and fell . And then he disappeared and he was gone . ” The group discussed where the robot went , and proposed that it might have “teleported” to Theo’s home . In this way , Raj and Theo’s narrative was continuous even though the two children were not co - located because of the connection through their use of a shared physical artifact ( the Toio robot ) . Example Vignette 11 . During session 13 , Isaac’s ro - bot was continuously moving off of the stage because of an unknown participant acting as a rogue robot operator . Due to this unexpected movement , Sonja and Katelyn could not control the robot predictably . Thus , Isaac was continuously redirecting the robot with his hands to avoid the table edge . In response to such unexpected robot behavior , the co - designers dis - cussed what emotion the robot might be expressing , comparing it to a lemming and suggesting that this behavior might be used in a “self - destruct” button or a “run - away” button . From here , the breakout group dis - cussed what the robot might be running away from , imagining how it might be the result of an unwanted display of affection or a threat , subsequently design - ing these expressions for the robot too . 7 DISCUSSION As a result of this longitudinal case study and design narrative we present three contributions for understanding co - design with chil - dren : ( 1 ) insights about the future of online co - design that emerged from our in - depth look at process and design ; ( 2 ) a conceptual model for longitudinal co - design online ; and ( 3 ) opportunities for further research on longitudinal co - design online , including the generation of new PD methods , techniques , and theories . 7 . 1 Lessons learned : The possibilities of online co - design Prior research on co - design online with children notes that ses - sions and designers will encounter many technical issues within online co - design [ 36 ] . Even after 20 sessions on the same itera - tive and evolving designs , we still observed children encountering challenges in utilizing both enterprise collaboration software ( e . g . , difficulties screen sharing over Zoom , how to present in Google Slides ) , and our own online robot control system . In Theme 1 , these technical issues taught us about how a lack of physical co - presence — which allows adults to help troubleshoot and work through tech - nical issues directly — resulted in significant , recurring technical difficulties in online co - design . As we made modifications to the technical space of online co - design , with the addition of the tabletop telepresence robots , we observed an increased sense of collabora - tion and ownership of physical projects in distributed design teams . Through embodied interaction , people develop spatial and physi - cal metaphors as they relate to understanding new concepts [ 33 ] , gestures to coordinate and share meaning [ 25 ] , and encoding of memory in perceptual and sensorimotor systems [ 6 ] . Historically , embodied aspects of co - design , like crafting and play acting have played an important role in creativity and collaboration [ 54 ] . How - ever , online co - designers in traditional configurations are unable to engage with each other’s crafts or respond to each other’s move - ments . Through the tabletop telepresence robots , children were engaging in physical collaborations , providing feedback on each other’s physical prototypes , and feeling a shared sense of ownership over projects . We argue that this preliminary finding demonstrates a need for child - computer interaction researchers to continue to consider physicality in fully remote co - design settings [ 52 ] . Online co - design is not just about working with children in isola - tion , but working with their multiple contexts [ 22 ] . This distributed nature means that in online co - design there is no separation be - tween home and design contexts , they are one in the same . In Theme 2 , we discussed how the social context of the home both inspired and distracted children in co - design . We found that the home context played an important role in the relationships between co - designers online , providing opportunities to make connections through sharing of personal belongings , family , and pets . Over time , co - design teams also began utilizing these connections as jumping off points in their iterative design ideations . The same inspiring home contexts competed for children’s attention during the session , resulting in unexpected distractions . The addition of the telepres - ence robots provided a new way for designers to connect and play together in their homes . While we were each physically stuck in iso - lation , the telepresence robots were distributed across our settings , making them the single common connection between designers’ spaces . Resnick [ 58 ] considered the idea of “distributed construc - tionism” ; that is , how technological networks could help children discuss , share , and collaborate on constructions remotely . Similarly , Zaphiris et al . [ 84 ] extended the notion of distributed construction - ism to PD , bringing forth that co - design methodology needs ways for children to connect and collaborate when engaged virtually . Through this longer - term deployment of telepresence robots that help children engage in distributed constructionism [ 58 ] , we discov - ered the home environment combined with our telepresence robots created a new way to understand distributed constructionism . We believe that child - computer interaction researchers can consider how tools and processes can integrate children’s home setting into the the discussion , sharing , and collaboration on constructions online . Finally , Theme 3 examined the need to offer flexibility in online co - design in longer term projects . Though we tried to standardize the co - design of our telepresence system with the same specific craft materials , tablets and settings , robots , and design strategies , we encountered more variability than similarities as a result of chil - dren’s high level of autonomy in online co - design . Instead , online co - design functions best when teams are open to improvisation and constantly vigilant to adaptation [ 36 ] . Across our project , pre - scribed co - design techniques became unsustainable . In response , we moved toward supporting improvisation on a structural level , 60 IDC ’23 , June 19 – 23 , 2023 , Chicago , IL , USA Hunt , et al . encouraging co - designers to explore what techniques worked for them , prioritizing the design goal in sessions rather than the de - sign method that children should use for their designs . Working with the telepresence robots over time and developing a shared understanding of them allowed these tangible objects to act as an - chor points for the design teams . Children were able to control the same robots together across different spaces and time zones synchronously , or they were able to design for their own robots and compare their experiences with this shared artifact . The robots were able to function in a variety of ways , which we leveraged to account for variability and differences across spaces . Intersub - jectivity is the idea of constructing new understandings within a social environment through the combination of different perspec - tives of social members and interlocutors . Having intersubjectivity contributes to the success of online collaborations [ 40 ] . We believe that co - design methods suitable for online engagements require in - depth flexible considerations in helping children share the same experiences together synchronously . Specifically , use of the Toio robots in co - design allowed children to share the same experience ( e . g . , creating and using the maze together , designing a sport for the robots ) while being far apart . In our case , we emphasized the use of physicality in telepresence to enhance children’s sense of shared ex - perience . Future co - design work needs to consider how online tools can enable designers to be flexible to accommodate variability in on - line co - design processes while supporting shared intersubjectivity among children with physical interactions in mind . 7 . 2 A conceptual model of online co - design over time COVID - 19 forced the entire world of children and adults into quar - antine for two years , from 2020 - 2022 ( with some parts of the world still in restrictions at the time of this writing ) . Prior work on children’s co - design has mostly focused on either the co - design of longer - term projects in - person [ 66 ] or online co - design that is fragmented across multiple projects [ 22 , 36 ] . In the analysis of more fragmented projects online , we note that the researchers’ as - sumption is that of co - design process as influencing and shaping the design product and artifacts ( Fig . 4 ) . Design techniques like Bags of Stuff [ 75 ] , Would You Rather [ 63 ] , and Comicboarding [ 47 ] are used to “enable children and adults to work together to create innovative technology for children” [ 27 ] . In contrast , our design case study examines the longitudinal online co - design of a single iteratively designed project ( tabletop telepresence robots ) over the course of two years . As we engaged in the design of a tool to bring physical telepresence to online interaction , we observed that the design of our technology platform also shaped our online co - design processes ( e . g . , considerations of physicality online , connecting chil - dren through shared play online , and a need for planned flexibility online ) . We argue that it is mainly through the longitudinal process of this design over time on a single project , that we were able to notice how the design itself started to shape our own co - design processes ( Fig . 4 ) . Through this work , we call on aspects of Schön [ 60 ] that as de - signers construct design worlds and the dimensions of the problem space , the designer also invents the moves needed to attempt to find solutions . Schön calls this process “see , draw , see” [ 60 ] . As Figure 4 : A conceptual model showing the relationship be - tween the short term ( left ) and longitudinal ( right ) online co - design process and the product of design . designers , we first “see” the materials and what is possible , then “draw” in relation to that representation of the materials . For us , we limited our “draw” interaction to a specific medium ( the telepres - ence robots ) and process ( online co - design ) . Because of our specific engagement with the medium , we are able appreciate the materials for what they are ( the physicality , playfulness , and sharedness of telepresence robots ) , and thus can “see” ( again ) how this specific longitudinal engagement shaped our online co - design processes . 7 . 3 The need for future longitudinal research for online co - design While online co - design comes with challenges , it serves an impor - tant function in the co - design toolkit , enabling children to partic - ipate even when they would not ordinarily be able to do so as a result of factors like geography , weather , transportation , illness , or disability [ 5 , 71 ] . As a result , online co - design can provide broader access for a diversity of participants [ 5 , 22 , 36 ] . Therefore , we need to consider the unique aspects of online co - design for longer term projects , and the facilitation strategies and technologies that might strengthen this approach . Previously , insights from in - person long term co - design projects have shaped the methods , techniques , and theories of co - design . For instance , the long term co - design of the International Digital Children’s Library in the late 1990s and 2000s supported Druin’s work to create Cooperative Inquiry as a philos - ophy , method , and collection of techniques for PD [ 19 , 20 ] . On a broader scale , the long term PD of the public library Dokk1 created new techniques and technologies to scaffold the involvement of the general public in designing community resources [ 14 , 15 ] . Our design project is an extension of the traditional ways in which PD and child co - design processes are ultimately shaped by the product we create . From the difficult situation of COVID - 19 and associated lockdowns , an opportunity emerged to move PD online at a larger scale . Therefore , we focused on a product ( tabletop telepresence robots ) to both design new ideas around telepresence for children , and explore how this added physical telepresence shapes online co - design processes . While COVID - 19 infection rates have improved , and lockdown restrictions have eased , there is still a need to consider distributed online co - design , not just as a backup solution for emergencies and disasters , but a true design methodology of its own . We argue that our insights emerged from a “critical mass” of time , number of participants , and scale of design 61 Designing Together , Miles Apart : A Longitudinal Tabletop Telepresence Adventure in Online Co - Design with Children IDC ’23 , June 19 – 23 , 2023 , Chicago , IL , USA which resulted in a chain reaction of insights about online co - design . These insights teach us that there is an opportunity for new techniques and methods in this emerging space for co - design . 8 CONCLUSION Our longitudinal study ( 2 years , 20 sessions ) examined the online co - design process through the design of a tabletop telepresence robot platform with 13 children ( ages 8 - 12 ) at the KidsTeam UW intergenerational PD teams . Our findings provide insights into the long - term co - design process and the strategies developed to adapt co - design methods to previously identified opportunities and challenges of online co - design [ 22 , 36 ] . Through our analysis of a longitudinal co - design study , we present deeper insights into on - line co - design , specifically the opportunities and challenges that emerged during long - term online co - design with children . In addi - tion , we described a conceptual model around long term co - design online , which identifies that the process of online co - design and the product of online co - design design shape one another . We showed how the online technology space demanded children to attend to and manage troubleshooting , how the home setting provided social context that impacted dynamics in online co - design , and how supporting children’s autonomy by allowing them to select co - design techniques lead to more efficient design outcomes online . As more researchers and designers consider online co - design for longitudinal work , we identify the need for more longitudinal on - line co - design research to generate new methods , techniques , and theories for this latent co - design methodology . 9 SELECTION AND PARTICIPATION OF CHILDREN Recruitment for KidsTeam UW children involved word - of - mouth , print media , and emails . Children ages 8 - 12 are able to partici - pate . Parents and guardians of child participants signed a consent form , along with child assent . We informed both families about the goals of the study , risks in safety and privacy , and confidentiality protocols . During the consent process , we indicated to families that children and parents were free to withdraw at any time . Re - searchers acted as facilitators online and made sure children did not feel under any pressure to participate with the study activities . All research has been approved by our university’s Institutional Review Board . All adult facilitators go through ethics and safety training for children at our institution . All children’s data were anonymized for the analysis and stored on a secure server .
