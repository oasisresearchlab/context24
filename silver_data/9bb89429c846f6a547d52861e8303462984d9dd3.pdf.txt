Summary Gastric infection by Helicobacter pylori ( Hp ) is associated with development of gastritis , ulcer - ations and gastric adenocarcinoma . Production and secretion of the vacuolating cytotoxin ( VacA ) is an essential Hp virulence factor . VacA is a multifunctional toxin , which exerts immunosup - pressive effects on human T lymphocytes via inhi - bition of cell proliferation and Interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) signalling . This latter effect of VacA is dependent on the b 2 - integrin subunit CD18 , acting as a recep - tor for intracellular uptake of VacA . In this study , we investigated the mechanism of endocytosis of VacA into primary human T lymphocytes . A screen with chemical inhibitors for different sets of kinases identiﬁed Ser / Thr kinases of the protein kinase C ( PKC ) family as crucial . Speciﬁc inhibitory peptides blocking PKC h or PKC z - phosphorylating activity , but not PKC a / b speciﬁc peptides , resulted in a strong reduction or com - plete block of VacA uptake . Thus the phosphory - lating activity of PKC h and PKC z is essential for the induction of VacA endocytosis . Furthermore , mimicking of a possible PKC - mediated threonine ( T 758 ) phosphorylation of the CD18 cytoplasmic tail in resting primary T cells induced VacA endocyto - sis via activation of the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac - 1 . We conclude that VacA is endocytosed into primary T cells via a clathrin - independent pathway . Introduction Helicobacter pylori ( Hp ) is a Gram - negative microaero - philic bacterium that persistently colonizes the gastric mucosa of > 50 % of the human population . Hp infection is associated with the development of peptic ulcer disease , and is an early risk factor for gastric adenocarcinoma and gastric lymphoma ( Suerbaum and Michetti , 2002 ) . The bacteria exhibit a set of pathogenicity factors , such as the cag - pathogenicity island ( cag - PAI ) , which encodes a Type IV secretion system ( cag - T4SS ) and the vacuolating cyto - toxin ( VacA ) , both of which are linked to gastric disease ( Suerbaum and Michetti , 2002 ) . Especially , the cag - T4SS , which is involved in translocation of the cytotoxin associ - ated antigen ( CagA ) into host cells ( Odenbreit et al . , 2000 ) , is associated with severe gastric inﬂammation , ulceration and an increased risk to develop gastric cancer ( Blaser et al . , 1995 ) . cmi _ 1551482 . . 496 The VacA toxin is produced as a 140 kDa precursor protein and is secreted by a type V autotransporter mechanism ( Fischer et al . , 2001 ) . The mature VacA protein ( 88 kDa ) shows sequence variations in the N - terminal signal sequence ( s1a , s1b , s1c , s2 ) , its middle region ( m1 , m2 ) , and a recently identiﬁed i - region ( i1 , i2 ) in different Hp strains ( Atherton et al . , 1995 ; Rhead et al . , 2007 ) . Acid - activated mature VacA forms anion - selective channels in planar membranes by oligomerization ( Iwamoto et al . , 1999 ; Szabo et al . , 1999 ) and is subse - quently internalized into eukaryotic cells ( Garner and Cover , 1996 ) . VacA induces acidic vacuoles in different cell types and different receptors for binding and internal - ization into epithelial cells have been reported ( Yahiro et al . , 1999 ; 2003 ; Gupta et al . , 2008 ) . The structure of the p55 VacA domain has recently been determined as a predominantly right - handed parallel b - helix ( Gangwer et al . , 2007 ) . VacA p55 seems to contain the receptor binding domain , since it is sufficient to bind cellular mem - branes ( Reyrat et al . , 1999 ) . Channel formation is medi - ated by the N - terminal hydrophobic region ( ~ 30 aa ) of the p33 VacA domain . In addition to the VacA pore , vacuole biogenesis requires the activity of the Rab7 GTPase and the V - type ATPase ( Papini et al . , 1996 ; 1997 ) . Other VacA effects relate to a depolarization of the host cell mem - brane potential , induction of apoptosis , and activation of signal cascades of the MAPK / ERK pathway .

Cellular Microbiology ( 2011 ) 13 ( 3 ) , 482 – 496 doi : 10 . 1111 / j . 1462 - 5822 . 2010 . 01551 . x First published online 13 December 2010 © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd cellular microbiology multiple activities , VacA has been described as a multi - functional toxin ( Cover and Blanke , 2005 ) . Studies over the last years identiﬁed VacA as an immu - notoxin , able to inhibit proliferation of T lymphocytes ( Boncristiano et al . , 2003 ; Gebert et al . , 2003 ; Sundrud et al . , 2004 ) . VacA interferes with the T - cell receptor / interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) signalling pathway at the level of the Ca 2 + - calmodulin - dependent phosphatase calcineurin . Nuclear translocation of the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) , a global regulator of immune gene expression , is blocked . As a consequence , expression of several cytokines , such as IL - 2 , MIP - 1 a , MIP - 1 b of activated T cells , is abrogated . Recently , we could identify the b 2 - integrin subunit CD18 of the leucocyte - speciﬁc integrin LFA - 1 as the functional recep - tor of VacA on T lymphocytes ( Sewald et al . , 2008 ) . LFA - 1 mediates VacA uptake , resulting in the inhibition of IL - 2 gene expression . Furthermore , the species - speciﬁcity for VacA to human T lymphocytes is mediated by CD18 and murine T cells are resistant to VacA - mediated inhibition of IL - 2 gene expression ( Algood et al . , 2007 ; Sewald et al . , 2008 ) . After binding to its speciﬁc receptor , VacA is subse - quently taken up and reaches the ﬁnal endocytic compart - ment , the late endosome . For epithelial cell lines the pathway of endocytosis has been characterized in more detail ( Gauthier et al . , 2005 ) . VacA is taken up via a clathrin - independent and Cdc42 - dependent pinocytic pathway into a peripheral early endocytic compartment ( Gauthier et al . , 2005 ) . The process of endocytosis and the following transport / maturation of VacA - containing vesicles to late endosomes depend on the actin cytoskeleton and GPI - anchored proteins inﬂuence the channel activity of VacA ( Gauthier et al . , 2007 ) . However , the mechanism of VacA endocytosis into immune cells , especially primary cells , has not been studied . Due to a deregulation of signalling cascades by transformation , many cancer cell lines , such as HeLa cells , show multiple pathways of VacA endocytosis , independent of cellular activation ( Ricci et al . , 2000 ) . In contrast , non - transformed cells , such as human primary T lymphocytes , do not endocytose VacA in a non - activated state in vitro , but are strictly dependent on the cellular activation status ( Sewald et al . , 2008 ) . Generally , protein kinases are important regulators of cellular activation states . Kinases of the protein kinase C ( PKC ) family play a major role for cellular activation and proliferation . Phorbol esters , such as phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) , are important co - carcinogens . They mainly act as a structural analogue of the natural signalling molecule diacylglycerol ( DAG ) , resulting in a long - lasting activation of PKC isoforms . Naturally , phos - phatidylinositol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) - trisphosphate ( PIP 3 ) is cleaved into DAG and inositol - 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( IP3 ) via different phospholipases after signalling from tyrosine kinase receptors ( i . e . the T - cell receptor , TCR ) or 7 - transmembrane receptors ( e . g . G protein - coupled receptors , GPCR ) . Up to now , seven proteins have been shown to be directly activated by binding of PMA / DAG using a conserved phorbol ester / diacylglycerol binding domain ( C1 domain ) . In addition to chimaerins , Ras guanyl nucleotide - releasing protein ( RasGRP ) , and Munc13s , the three kinase families protein kinase D ( PKD ) , diacylglycerol kinase ( DAGK ) , and PKC are stimu - lated by phorbol esters ( Yang and Kazanietz , 2003 ) . In the present study we characterized the mechanism of VacA endocytosis into primary CD4 + T cells and iden - tiﬁed PKC Ser / Thr kinases as central mediators of VacA uptake . Pharmacological inhibition identiﬁed PKC iso - forms PKC h and PKC z as essential regulatory elements . In addition , a crucial role of the cytoplasmic part of the b 2 integrin subunit CD18 could be demonstrated , which func - tionally links the integrin receptor with uptake of VacA . Results Uptake of VacA into primary human CD4 + T cells is dependent on the type of activation The transformed human T - cell line Jurkat E6 . 1 takes up VacA constitutively , resulting in cellular vacuolation and inhibition of IL - 2 gene transcription . In contrast , non - activated , primary human CD4 + T cells do not respond to VacA treatment in vitro . However , pretreatment of these cells with PMA or a - CD3 / CD28 - coated polystyrene beads ( hereafter termed a - CD3 / CD28 - PSB ) sensitizes these cells for VacA ( Sewald et al . , 2008 ) . To explore the type of T - cell activation needed for VacA uptake , we tested activation via different cytokines ( CXCL - 12 , CCL21 ) , the phorbol ester PMA , or a direct T - cell receptor stimulation via a - CD3 / CD28 - PSB . VacA was puriﬁed from Hp culture supernatant and labelled with the Alexa488 dye . Stimulated primary human T cells were infected with VacA - Alexa488 for 30 min . Live cell confocal microscopy ( live imaging ) studies showed that VacA could only be found in the cytosol of PMA - or a - CD3 / CD28 - PSB - treated cells . VacA was observed punctually clus - tered , assuming localization in membrane vesicles ( see arrows ; Fig . 1A ) . In non - stimulated T cells and T cells treated with the cytokines CXCL - 12 or CCL21 for different time points ( 1 , 5 , 15 , 30 min ; data shown for 15 min ) respectively , VacA was bound to the cell surface , but could hardly be detected inside the cells ( Fig . 1A ) . To determine the rate of VacA endocytosis , a recently established quantiﬁcation assay via FACS analysis was applied ( Sewald et al . , 2008 ) . Endocytosis of VacA - Alexa488 was measured by quenching of extracellular ﬂuorescence via an a - Alexa488 monoclonal antibody ( Invitrogen ) . Although cytokine - stimulated primary T cells Endocytosis of VacA into primary T cells 483 © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 13 , 482 – 496 showed a polarization typical for stimulated lymphocytes ( data not shown ) , VacA was not taken up under any con - ditions by these cytokine treatments . In contrast , VacA was readily internalized into T cells stimulated with PMA or a - CD3 / CD28 - PSB ( Fig . 1B ) . These data indicated that a T - cell stimulation , as obtained by the cytokine treatment , seems to be insufficient for endocytosis of VacA . Thus , to induce uptake of VacA into primary CD4 + T cells a speciﬁc and strong activation is necessary , such as that obtained by the T - cell receptor ligation or by direct PMA treatment resulting in activated T cells . A screen for cellular kinases identiﬁes PKC as essential for uptake of VacA into primary T cells A recent genome - wide analysis for clathrin - and caveolae / raft - mediated endocytosis events in epithelial cells identi - ﬁed several kinases involved in this process , supporting a central function of kinases for endocytosis ( Pelkmans et al . , 2005 ) . In addition , a prominent role of kinases in the endocytosis and / or recycling of membrane proteins , such as integrins , is well known ( Woods et al . , 2004 ; Ivaska et al . , 2005 ; Caswell and Norman , 2006 ) . Since the leucocyte - speciﬁc LFA - 1 integrin heterodimer is critically involved in a functional uptake of VacA into CD4 + T cells ( Sewald et al . , 2008 ) , the data prompted us to screen for different categories of cellular kinases that are eventually controlling the uptake of VacAinto primaryTcells ( Fig . 2A ) . Primary cells are less amenable to genetic tools . We therefore started to use small chemical inhibitors to block certain sets of cellular kinases . First , kinases directly acti - vated by PMA were inhibited ( Fig . 2B , green block , Table 1 ) . Second , kinases reported to be involved in endocytosis and / or recycling of integrins were tested for a function in the uptake of VacA into primary T cells ( Fig . 2B , grey block , Table 1 ) . For the kinase inhibitor screen , PMA - and a - CD3 / CD28 - PSB - stimulated primary T cells were incubated with the appropriate inhibitor prior to adding VacA - Alexa488 . Endocytosis of VacA was quantiﬁed after 30 min via FACS analysis ( Fig . 2B ) . Interestingly , inhibi - tion of PKCs with the general PKC inhibitor BIM II com - pletely blocked VacA uptake , independent of the type of stimulation ( Fig . 2B ) . In contrast , inhibition of DAGK activ - ity resulted in a reduction in VacA uptake when T cells were stimulated by a - CD3 / CD28 - PSB , but not by PMA . The PMA - activated PKD seems not to be involved in VacA endocytosis . In the group of kinases involved in integrin endocytosis / recycling , casein kinase 1 ( CK1 ) - inhibition resulted in a reduction of VacA uptake to ~ 60 % , indepen - dent of the mode of T - cell stimulation . Inhibition of myosin - light - chain kinase ( MLCK ) or Ca 2 + / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase ( CaMK ) showed also a small effect on VacA uptake , but mainly for a - CD3 / CD28 - PSB - stimulated primary T cells ( Fig . 2B ) . Taken together , these data indi - cate an essential , major role of PKCs for the uptake of VacA into primary T cells . TCR ligation or PMA treatment induces a speciﬁc uptake of VacA into CD4 + T cells The PMA treatment of primary T cells may result in an unspeciﬁc , general activation of cellular endocytosis . Fig . 1 . Stimulation of primary CD4 + T cells with CD3 / CD28 - PSB and PMA , but not cytokines induces VacA endocytosis . Primary CD4 + T cells were stimulated with PMA for 30 min , a - CD3 / CD28 - PSB for 24 h , or cytokines CXCL - 12 and CCL21 for various time points ( 1 , 5 , 15 , 30 min ) prior to the addition of 0 . 75 m g ml - 1 VacA - Alexa488 . A . Endocytosis could be observed after 30 min as punctual cluster ( arrows ) of VacA - Alexa488 in the cytosol of primary T cells stimulated with CD3 / CD28 - PSB and PMA , but not with cytokines ( 15 min time point ) by live cell confocal microscopy .

In contrast to VacA - Alexa488 , an increase in endocytosis of CtxB - Alexa488 or Tf - Alexa488 was not detectable by PMA treatment of the cells ( Fig . 3A ) . Trans - ferrin did not at all enter resting and PMA - stimulated T cells , whereas CtxB - Alexa488 was taken up by resting and PMA - stimulated primary T lymphocytes to the same extent ( Fig . 3A ) . However , a - CD3 / CD28 - PSB stimulated T cells readily internalized CtxB - Alexa488 and Tf - Alexa488 . To analyse a possible contribution of PKCs on endocytosis of CtxB - Alexa488 or Tf - Alexa488 , PKC inhibitors were used . VacA Fig . 2 .

In contrast to PMA - stimulated T cells , a - CD3 / CD28 - PSB - stimulated cells strongly endocytosed Tf - Alexa488 . The general PKC inhibitor BIM II had no signiﬁcant effect on transferrin uptake , but endocytosis of CtxB - Alexa488 could be reduced , indicating a role of PKC isoforms in the endocy - tosis of CtxB in primary T cells by a - CD3 / CD28 - PSB stimulation . In conclusion , our data suggest that primary human CD4 + T lymphocytes , stimulated by the T - cell receptor or PMA , activate a very distinct endocytic pathway mediating endocytosis of VacA , which seems to be dependent on the activation of PKCs . PKC isotype - speciﬁc blocking peptides identify PKC h and PKC z as essential for VacA endocytosis To differentiate between PKC isoforms that are involved in VacA endocytosis into primary T cells , we used PKC inhibitors for different PKC isoforms ( Table 2 ) . Primary T cells were stimulated with PMA or a - CD3 / CD28 - PSB and VacA - Alexa488 uptake was quantiﬁed in the presence of inhibitors . All inhibitors used blocked VacA uptake to more or less the same extent , independent of the way of T - cell stimulation ( Fig . S1 ) . Thus , the general isoform inhibitors were not suitable to determine the particular PKC isoform necessary for VacA endocytosis , probably due to their low speciﬁcity and strong cross - reactivity with other isoforms . To further address the role of individual PKC isoforms in Tlymphocytes , we took advantage of the ability of synthetic pseudosubstrate peptides , with sequences based on the highly speciﬁc endogenous PKC pseudosubstrate region ( House and Kemp , 1987 ) , to inhibit different PKC kinases . Peptides were synthesized with an N - terminal myristic acid ( myr ) to facilitate their diffusion through the plasma membrane , as previously reported ( Eichholtz et al . , 1993 ) ( Table 3 ) . Primary T cells were incubated with myr - PKC a / b , myr - PKC h or myr - PKC z peptides , isotypes for which speciﬁc peptides have been used and validated in the past ( Eichholtz et al . , 1993 ; Laudanna et al . , 1998 ) . Uptake of VacA - Alexa488 was quantiﬁed via FACS analy - sis , using CtxB - Alexa488 and Tf - Alexa488 as controls . Similar to the chemical PKC inhibitors ( Fig . S1 ) , enzymatic inhibition of PKC z and PKC h by speciﬁc inhibitory peptides resulted in a complete block of VacAuptake for inhibition of PKC z and a 50 % reduction for PKC h inhibition ( Fig . 4 ) . Interestingly , the inhibitory peptide directed against PKC a / b did not block VacA uptake , but rather increased Table 2 . Small molecule inhibitors of different PKC isoforms .

Haas © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 13 , 482 – 496 endocytosis of VacA slightly but not signiﬁcantly . These data suggest a negative regulatory effect of PKC a / b for endocytosis of VacA . Inhibition of PKC z activity dramati - cally increased CtxB uptake , but did not affect transferrin endocytosis , indicating that the different endocytic path - ways in general are functional . Also , the inhibitory peptide against PKC h signiﬁcantly reduced VacA uptake but did not affect CtxB and Tf endocytosis . On the contrary , block - ing of PKC a / b did not inﬂuence CtxB uptake , but rather stimulated endocytosis of VacA and transferrin . Similar results were obtained with the JurkatT - cell line ( Fig . S2 ) . In conclusion , the peptide inhibition demonstrates an essen - tial function of PKC z and PKC h in the endocytosis of VacA into T cells . Beyond that , our data suggest a more general role of PKC isoforms positively or negatively regulating different endocytic pathways . PKCs are dependent on the VacA receptor CD18 for endocytosis of VacA Our data demonstrate a central role of PKC h and PKC z in the uptake of VacAinto primary T cells . Since CD18 , the b 2 integrin subunit of the leucocyte - speciﬁc integrin LFA - 1 has been identiﬁed as the receptor of VacA on T cells , we wondered whether CD18 might be essential for the endocytosis mediated by PKC . To test this hypothesis , we made use of the Jurkat E6 . 1 cell line and its mutant derivative , Jurkat - b 2 . 7 ( J - b 2 . 7 ) , defective in LFA - 1 on the surface ( Weber et al . , 1997 ) . Functional complementation of J - b 2 . 7 with a CD11 a gene resulted in genetic comple - mentation and restoration of LFA - 1 function ( J - b 2 . 7 / a L ) . To prove that the PKC - dependent pathway for VacA uptake is dependent on the presence of CD18 in T cells , Jurkat ( wt ) , J - b 2 . 7 ( LFA - 1 - negative ) and J - b 2 . 7 / a L ( complemented ) T cells were treated with the myristoylated peptide inhibitors against PKC a / b or PKC z . Blocking PKC a / b activity had no inhibitory effect in any cell line ( Fig . 5A ) . The stimulatory effect of PKC a / b - speciﬁc peptides was less pronounced as seen with primary T cells ( compare Fig . 5A with Fig . 4 ) . In contrast , inhibition of the PKC z isoform led to a 50 % reduction in VacAuptake in Jurkat wt T cells . This inhibitory effect of the peptides was strongly reduced in the LFA - defective J - b 2 . 7 cell line , which showed a ~ 15 % reduction in VacAendocytosis . Functional complementation of LFA - 1 expression in J - b 2 . 7 / a L cells restored the sensitivity of VacA endocytosis towards PKC z inhibition . Taken together , these data clearly suggest a functional connec - tion between CD18 and PKCs in the process of VacA endocytosis . Phosphorylation of CD18 at Thr 758 of its cytoplasmic tail is essential and sufficient to induce uptake of VacA Ser / Thr phosphorylation of the CD18 cytoplasmic tail by PKC is a physiologically important modiﬁcation . Notably , Thr 758 of the triple threonine - motif speciﬁc for the CD18 integrin subunit is phosphorylated upon T - cell receptor cross - linking as well as upon phorbol esters treatment ( Hilden et al . , 2003 ; Nurmi et al . , 2007 ) . Phosphorylation - dependent binding of various adapter proteins , e . g . 14 - 3 - 3 , a - actinin , to the cytplasmic domain of CD18 ( Takala et al . , 2008 ) , can activate the small GTPases Rac1 / Cdc42 leading to actin rearrangement and cell adhesion ( Nurmi et al . , 2007 ) . Since VacA endocytosis is induced after TCR as well as PMA stimu - lation , we speculated that PKC - mediated Thr 758 phos - phorylation could be an essential step in the mechanism leading to VacA uptake . To test this hypothesis , peptide fragments were generated , corresponding to amino acids 753 – 763 of the integrin CD18 chain ( Table 4 ) Table 4 .

Endocytosis of VacA into primary T cells 487 © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 13 , 482 – 496 ( Genscript ) . The peptides were synthesized in a non - phosphorylated form ( CD18 ) and with a phosphate group on Thr 758 ( CD18 - ThrP ) . For membrane transfer into primary T cells , peptides were covalently linked via a disulﬁde bridge to penetratin ( Pen ) . Transfer of the peptide – penetratin complex was tested by detecting the biotin tag of penetratin ( Fig . S3 ) . Treatment of non - stimulated primary T cells with the phosphorylated peptide ( Pen - CD18ThrP ) resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in the rate of VacA uptake , as com - pared with Pen - CD18 - treated T cells ( Fig . 5B ) . Cells treated with non - phosphorylated peptide ( Pen - CD18 ) showed a level of VacA endocytosis similar to the penetra - tin control without CD18 peptide ( Pen ) . The increase of VacA endocytosis of Pen - CD18ThrP - treated T lympho - cytes by 30 % , as compared with Pen - treated cells was slightly lower in comparison to the earlier experiments ( Fig . 1B ) . This lower but signiﬁcant increase of VacA uptake after PMA stimulation could be attributed to the different serum concentrations in these assays . During peptide treatment cells had to be grown under low - serum conditions ( 2 % Nu - Serum ) . The lower increase of VacA Fig . 5 .

Jiménez - Soto and R . Haas © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 13 , 482 – 496 uptake after PMAstimulation ( as compared with Fig . 1B ) is therefore based on a higher basal endocytosis rate in non - stimulated T cells under low serum conditions . In conclusion , the transfer of a Thr 758 - phosphorylated CD18 peptide fragment leads to a signiﬁcant stimulation of VacA endocytosis in non - stimulated T cells , suggesting a direct role of Thr 758 phosphorylation in stimulation of VacA uptake . GTPases CDC42 and Rac - 1 are involved in endocytosis of VacA We next examined if the aforementioned stimulation of VacA uptake by CD18 - ThrP peptide is mediated by the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac - 1 . Using inhibitors to block the activity of the small GTPases , a central function of Cdc42 and Rac - 1 for VacA endocytosis could also be demonstrated for primary T cells ( Fig . 5C ) . To obtain evi - dence for a functional link between transfer of CD18 - ThrP peptide and GTPase - mediated VacA uptake , primary T cells were incubated for 20 min with the Cdc42 - speciﬁc inhibitor secraminA ( Pelish et al . , 2006 ) and the Rac - 1 inhibitor NSC23766 ( Calbiochem ) after transfer of CD18 peptide fragments . Treatment of the cells with the inhibi - tors decreased the rate of VacA uptake in Pen - and Pen - CD18 - treated T cells due to GTPase - inhibition to a basal level of ~ 80 % ( Fig . 5D ) . This might reﬂect a basal stimu - lation of T cells under low - serum conditions , as mentioned above . Clearly , also in Pen - CD18 - ThrP - activated T cells treated with Cdc42 or Rac - 1 inhibitors , VacA endocytosis rate was reduced to the same basal level ( Fig . 5D ) . In conclusion , these data show that a speciﬁc stimulation of primary T cells via the CD18 - ThrP peptide can be blocked by inhibitors of CDC42 or Rac - 1 , suggesting a functional link between the CD18 cytoplasmic tail , probably via PKC isoforms , and activation of the small GTPases CDC42 and Rac - 1 . VacA forms vacuoles containing marker proteins LAMP1 and Rab7 in primary T cells After endocytosis into HeLa cells , VacA is sorted to early endosomal structures that have been described as GPI - anchored protein - enriched early endosomal compart - ments ( GEECs ) ( Gauthier et al . , 2005 ) . At later time points ( > 4 h ) VacA reaches the late endosome and forms hybrid compartments containing marker proteins of late endosomes ( Rab7 ) and early lysosomes ( LAMP - 1 ) . The addition of weak bases , such as NH 4 Cl , leads to an osmotic swelling of these membrane structures , matching the acidic vacuoles described as the characteristic VacA effect . Since all these studies have been performed in epithelial cell lines , we were interested in the intracellular trafficking of VacA in primary T cells . To study the intracellular localization of VacA , primary CD4 + T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding endosomal marker proteins fused to GFP or YFP . For early endosomes Rab5 – GFP was expressed in T cells . Rab7 – YFP and LAMP1 – YFP correspond to markers for late endosomes and early lysosomes respectively . Since LFA - 1 may be recycled back to the cell membrane via the recycling endosome ( Fabbri et al . , 2005 ) , Rab11 – GFP was expressed to study a possible colocalization with VacA . After transfection with the plasmid constructs , primary T cells were infected with 1 m g ml - 1 VacA - Alexa555 . Intracellular distribution and colocalization of VacA with marker proteins was determined 30 min and 24 h after infection respectively . At the time point 24 h , cells were pre - incubated for 30 min with 2 mM NH 4 Cl to induce vacuole swelling . VacA - Alexa555 was found after 30 min in vesicles con - taining Rab5 – GFP and Rab7 – YFP , representing early / late endosomes ( Fig . 6 ; see arrows ) . Colocalization with the marker protein LAMP1 – YFP was readily detectable . In contrast to these endosomal markers , VacAdid not overlap with Rab11 – GFP for the recycling endosome , neither at early time points ( 30 min ) , nor at very late time points ( 24 h ) ( Fig . 6 ) . After 24 h of infection cells showed moderate induction of vacuoles that were positive for Rab7 – YFP and LAMP1 – YFP . VacA could be found punctually concen - trated on the vacuole membrane , as seen in Fig . 6 ( Rab7 , arrow head ) or evenly distributed inside the vacuole ( Rab7 , star ) . At late time points VacA could not be detected in Rab5 - positive early endosomes . Comparable results were obtained in Jurkat T lymphocytes , Raji B lymphocytes and HeLa cells ( data not shown ) . In conclusion , these results demonstrate a comparable distribution and trafficking of VacA in primary T cells and different cell lines , suggesting a general pathway for intracellular transport . Discussion In this study we describe the mechanism of endocytosis of the bacterial immunotoxin VacA into primary human T lymphocytes . VacA is a multifunctional toxin able to enter epithelial as well as immune cells via different cellular receptors , such as sphingomyelin ( Gupta et al . , 2008 ) , receptor - like protein tyrosine phosphatase ( RPTP ) a ( Yahiro et al . , 2003 ) , RPTP b ( Yahiro et al . , 2004 ) ( epithe - lial cells ) or CD18 ( leucocytes ) ( Sewald et al . , 2008 ) . Here we show that VacA uses for its cellular uptake into T lymphocytes PKC - dependent signalling , involving phos - phorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of CD18 . We identiﬁed as key players PKC z and PKC h acting as positive regu - lators , and PKC a as negative regulator for VacA uptake into human primary T lymphocytes . The central function of these PKC members in regulation of toxin endocytosis was demonstrated by highly speciﬁc inhibitory peptides Endocytosis of VacA into primary T cells 489 © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 13 , 482 – 496 against PKC isoforms . The comparative application of transferrin and CtxB as well - studied markers of endocy - tosis demonstrated a speciﬁc uptake mechanism for VacA and a major function of these two PKC isoforms in this process . In addition , our experiments support and high - light the general role of PKCs in clathrin - dependent ( transferrin ) and clathrin - independent ( CtxB , VacA ) path - ways of endocytosis . Activated primary human T cells rapidly bind VacA at the uropod and internalize it , whereas in resting , non - activated T cells VacA is equally distributed and is not internalized ( Sewald et al . , 2008 ) . This suggests that VacA cannot induce its own endocytosis ( or only with low efficiency ) in vitro and relies on factors that are activated after T - cell stimulation . Thereby , T - cell receptor - mediated activation ( a - CD3 / CD28 - PSB ) , or direct activation of primary T cells via the phorbol ester PMA , resulted in rapid VacA uptake . In contrast , treatment with cytokines CXCL - 12 or CCL21 was not sufficient to induce VacA endocytosis , assuming that extensive stimulation of primary T cells is necessary . Our studies with chemical inhibitors demonstrated that PKC h and PKC z , a novel and an atypical PKC isoform , respectively , are essential for VacA endocytosis , although we cannot exclude that other PKC family members may also play a role . PKC z has been described in many cell types as a broad regulator of cell polarity acting together with par proteins ( Par3 , Par6 ) , Cdc42 and Rac - 1 ( Kim , 2000 ) . Furthermore , the chemokine CXCL - 12 has been shown to activate PKC mediating chemotaxis , cell polar - ization and adhesion of CD34 + progenitor cells ( Petit et al . , 2005 ) . Until now , there are only few reports describ - ing a function of the isoform PKC z in endocytosis ( Fiory et al . , 2004 ; Gusarova et al . , 2009 ) . We show here that treatment of primary T cells with soluble chemokines , such as CXCL - 12 and CCL21 , did not induce VacA uptake , although these treatments are known to activate PKC z by signalling via the CXCL - 12 receptor ( a GPCR ) , thereby triggering high - affinity LFA - 1 conformations and subsequent actin rearrangements ( Laudanna , 2005 ; Shamri et al . , 2005 ) . Hence , cytokine - induced T - cell stimulation by activation of PKC z seems not to be suffi - cient to induce VacA endocytosis and additional factors are probably necessary . On the other hand , we show that inhibition of PKC z by an inhibitory peptide was sufficient to block VacA endocytosis . It is unclear how PKC z is activated in this scenario , since it does not directly respond on PMA , DAG or Ca 2 + ( Steinberg , 2008 ) . For full activation of PKC z two events , ( i ) the release of the pseudo substrate ( PS ) region from the substrate - binding cavity and ( ii ) ( auto ) - phosphorylation of the kinase domain , are necessary ( Steinberg , 2008 ) . In addition , lipid components such as phosphatidylinositols , phosphatidic acid , arachidonic acid and ceramide play a role in PKC activation . Atypical PKC z may also be activated through phosphorylation by PKD - 1 , which binds with high affinity to the PI 3 - kinase lipid product phosphatidylinositol - 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( PIP3 ) . The phosphatidylinositol PIP3 is produced through phosphoinositid - 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) by phosphorylation of PI - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate . The relevance for PI3K activity in regulation of VacA uptake is not clear . Our inhibition studies of PI3K activity using the inhibitor wortmannin resulted in 10 – 20 % inhibition , independent of the way of T - cell activation ( data not shown ) . Furthermore , we could show that inhibition of phosphoinositide - speciﬁc phospho - lipase C ( PI - PLC ) with inhibitor U73122 had no effect on VacA endocytosis ( Fig . S4 ) , although PI - PLC is activated after TCR engagement and is able to generate DAG . However , DAG may be generated from different sources . Fig . 6 . VacA - Alexa488 is transported in primary CD4 + T cells via early endosomal structures to late endosomes , but not recycling endosome . Primary CD4 + T cells were transfected with pRab5 – GFP , pRab7 – YFP , pLAMP1 – YFP and pRab11 – GFP with Nucleofector Kit L ( Amaxa biosystems ) . After 24 h cells were transferred in glass - bottom dishes ( MatTek ) coated with recombinant human ICAM - 1 and were incubated with VacA - Alexa488 . Cellular localization of VacA - Alexa488 was determined at different time points using live cell confocal microscopy . 490 X . Sewald , L . Jiménez - Soto and R . Haas © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 13 , 482 – 496 The phorbol ester PMA activates classical as well as novel PKC isoforms by binding to the C1 - domain , mimick - ing the natural cofactor DAG . A possible explanation for PKC z activation by PMA is the involvement of PKC h as positive and PKC a as negative regulator of VacA endocy - tosis . In contrast to PKC z , the novel PKC h is directly activated by DAG / PMA . Its function in endocytic pathways at the plasma membrane is unexpected , since PKC h is reported to localize at the Golgi and the endoplasmatic reticulum ( ER ) in ﬁbroblast cells ( Lehel et al . , 1995 ) . Upon PMA activation and serum - starvation it translocates to the nuclear envelope ( Steinberg , 2008 ) . Interestingly , PKC h has been shown to activate PKC z by phosphorylation . Since VacA uptake can be blocked after PMA stimulation by inhibition of the atypical PKC z , acting independent of the cofactors DAG or Ca 2 + , our data suggest that PKC z might act downstream of PKC h representing the terminal PKC in the sequence leading to VacA uptake , probably by directly phosphorylating CD18 ( see Fig . 7 for a model ) . In contrast , the inﬂuence of PKC a on PKC z activity could be more indirect . Blocking of PKC a / b activity in primary T cells resulted in an increased VacA endocytosis rate ( Fig . 4 ) . A possible link could be the second messenger phosphatidic acid ( PA ) . Inhibition of DAGK , the kinase leading to the conversion of DAG to PA , blocked VacA uptake in CD3 / CD28 - PSB - , but not in PMA - stimulated T cells ( Fig . 2B ) . This antagonistic regulation might be explained by a PMA - mediated activation of PKCs down - stream of DAGK . It has been shown that PA can act as an regulator of activity for different enzymes , such as Protein Phosphatase 1 ( PP1 ) or p21 - activating kinase - 1 ( PAK - 1 ) , but also of PKC e and atypical PKC z ( Stasek et al . , 1993 ; Limatola et al . , 1994 ; Kishikawa et al . , 1999 ; Chianale et al . , 2010 ) . Studies showed that PKC a acts as a negative feedback regulator for DAGK activity ( Fig . 7 ) ( Luo et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , inhibition of PKC a activity leads to an increased production of PA , an activator of PKC z activ - ity , resulting in an increased endocytosis of VacA ( Fig . 7 ) . The cytoplasmic tail of integrin subunits is crucial for the dynamic interaction with many different integrin - binding Fig . 7 . Working model of the mechanism for PKC - and CD18 - dependent uptake of VacA into primary CD4 + T cells . ( 1 ) VacA might initially bind to a human - speciﬁc cellular membrane factor ( sphingomyelin , SM or a GPI - anchored protein , glycolipid ) . ( 2 ) Next , VacA binds CD18 , which in activated T cells is transferred to lipid rafts at the uropod of the trailing edge . ( 3 ) Oligomerization of the integrin in lipid raft domain leads to phosphorylation of Thr 758 of the cytoplasmic domain of CD18 by PKC h directly , or via PKC z . ( 4 ) Talin will be removed from the CD18 cytoplasmic tail by cleavage via calpain ( 2 ) and the adaptor protein 14 - 3 - 3 will bind phosphorylated T 758 ( Nurmi et al . , 2006 ; Takala et al . , 2008 ) . Adaptor protein binding initiates recruitment and activation of small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac - 1 . ( 5 ) Actin rearrangements lead to endocytosis of VacA into the cell and transport to late endosomal structures . Endocytosis of VacA into primary T cells 491 © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 13 , 482 – 496 proteins regulating integrin function ( for recent reviews see Gahmberg et al . , 2009 ; Moser et al . , 2009 ) . Phospho - rylation on Tyr and Ser / Thr residues by various kinases plays a central role in affinity / avidity regulation of inte - grins , regulating cell adhesion and migration by the inter - action with its ligands . The essential function of the cytoplasmic tail of CD18 for VacA intoxication has already been demonstrated by CHO cells expressing wt and mutant LFA - 1 . In contrast to wt CD18 , a deleted form of CD18 ( CD18 D 733 ) , missing the cytoplasmic tail , was resistant to VacA - induced vacuolation , suggesting a func - tion of the CD18 cytoplasmic tail in intracellular signalling ( Sewald et al . , 2008 ) . Using the Jurkat and the well - deﬁned LFA - 1 - deﬁcient J b 2 . 7 cell line , we now demon - strated that the PKC isoforms involved in VacA endocytosis depend on CD18 . Thus , the linkage is most probably via phosphorylation of critical residues in the CD18 cytoplasmic tail via PKC . The b 2 - subunit CD18 contains two NPxY - like motifs and a Thr – Thr – Thr ( TTT ) - motif ( Thr 758 – 760 ) . Phosphorylation of these conserved amino acids regulates inside - out signal - ling , endocytosis and / or recycling of b 2 - integrins , pro - cesses important for integrin functions , such as adhesion and migration ( Gahmberg et al . , 2009 ) . For the b 2 - integrin subunit of LFA - 1 in neutrophils a conserved Tyr ( Y735 ) close to the membrane has been identiﬁed as crucial for LFA - 1 - recycling to the plasma membrane ( Fabbri et al . , 1999 ) . PKC - dependent phosphorylation was not found by an in vitro phosphorylation assay ; however , PKC a and PKC h have been shown to be involved in phosphorylation of Thr 758 of CD18 in vitro . It is however not clear which of the PKC isoforms phosphorylates S 745 , S 756 or Thr 758 – 760 of CD18 in vivo ( Fagerholm et al . , 2002 ) . Importantly , the pattern of CD18 phosphorylation at Ser / Thr residues seems to vary depending on the way of stimulation . Phorbol ester ( PMA ) stimulation or TCR acti - vation of T cells results in phosphorylation of this triple threonine motif ( Thr 758 – 760 ) , whereas CD3 / CD28 - mediated TCR ligation induces Thr 758 phosphorylation only ( Nurmi et al . , 2007 ) . In agreement with these data , we show here that transfer of the cytoplasmic tail of CD18 containing a phosphorylated Thr 758 residue as a peptide – penetratin complex clearly induced VacA endocytosis in resting T cells ( Fig . 4 ) . Our data demonstrate that phosphorylation of Thr 758 of CD18 is necessary and sufficient to induce cellular uptake of VacA . Thr 758 - phosphorylated CD18 recruits adaptor proteins , such as the 14 - 3 - 3 protein ( Takala et al . , 2008 ) , which results in a local activation of the small GTPases Cdc42 and / or Rac - 1 , initiating endocytosis of VacA bound to LFA - 1 . Inhibition of Cdc42 or Rac - 1 activity abrogated the CD18 - ThrP - induced uptake of VacA in non - stimulated T cells ( Figs 5 and 7 ) . The pathway for VacA endocytosis was recently studied in HeLa and AGS cell lines ( Gauthier et al . , 2005 ) , but trafficking of VacA in primary T cells is unknown . We show here that a very similar subcellular trafficking of VacA is seen in primary T cells ( Fig . 6 ) , suggesting a general pathway of VacA trafficking in dif - ferent cell types . This is of particular interest since these cell types differ in their cellular receptors for VacA , but also in activation of signalling cascades . The integrin LFA - 1 with its subunits CD11a and CD18 is restricted to leucocytes . For the epithelial cell lines AZ - 521 and HeLa the VacA - receptors were identiﬁed as RPTP a and RPTP b . Assuming that VacA reaches identical cellular compartments despite different surface receptors , it might be speculated that RPTP a / b and LFA - 1 share similar mechanism for endocytosis . Although we demon - strate here a function of b 2 integrin in VacA uptake , a possible contribution of RPTP a / b for VacA uptake or PKC activity cannot be excluded . However , VacA binding and endocytosis into primary CD4 + T cells is indepen - dent of VacA channel activity ( Fig . S5 ) . Furthermore , uptake of VacA into primary T cells is independent of clathrin , as already reported for VacA uptake into HeLa or AGS cells ( Gauthier et al . , 2005 ) ( Fig . S6 ) . Interest - ingly , in NIH3T3 cells a phosphorylation of serine resi - dues of RPTP a was reported ( Tracy et al . , 1995 ) . Stimulation of these cells with the phorbol ester TPA led to a rapid increase of RPTP a phosphorylation at Ser - 180 and Ser - 204 , indicating RPTP a as direct substrate of PKCs . Thus , the multifunctional bacterial toxin VacA seems to exploit different types of receptors on various cell types , which may respond to a common mechanism of internalization being governed by central members of the PKC family . Experimental procedures Strains and cell culture Primary human CD4 + T cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium ( Gibco ) supplemented with 10 % foetal bovine serum ( FCS ; Gibco ) .

Plasmids pRab5 – GFP , pRab7 – YFP , pRab11 – GFP and pLAMP1 – YFP were kind gifts from Dr Mothes ( Yale University , New Haven , USA ) . An siRNA knockdown approach of PKC h or PKC z in primary human T cells ( Quiagen and Dhamacon SMARTpool ) was not successful . Preparation of human PBLC and isolation of primary CD4 + T cells Peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBLC ) were isolated from human peripheral blood as described ( Gebert et al . , 2003 ) . Brieﬂy , Ficoll - Hypaque density gradient centrifugation using Biocoll separating solution ( density 1 . 077 g ml - 1 ; Biochrom AG ) was applied , fol - lowed by positive selection of CD4 + T cells using the MACS cell separation system ( Miltenyi Biotec ) with beads coated with anti - human CD4 antibody . Puriﬁcation was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Cells were maintained in RPMI medium containing 10 % FCS at 37°C in a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . T - cell stimulation Primary T cells were stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) for 30 min or the cytokines CXCL - 12 ( 0 . 1 m M ) or CCL21 ( 0 . 1 m M ) ( Immunotools ) for indicated time points ( 1 , 5 , 15 and 30 min ) . For stimulation of T cells via the T - cell receptor ( CD3 ) / co - receptor ( CD28 ) complex polystyrene beads ( Polysciences ) were coated with anti - human CD3 and CD28 ( BD ) monoclonal antibodies as recently described ( Gebert et al . , 2003 ) . In short , 5 ¥ 10 7 beads were resuspended in 15 ml cold PBS ( Gibco ) and incubated for 1 . 5 h at 37°C using 5 m g anti - CD3 and 20 m g anti - CD28 ( BD ) . After centrifugation at 8750 g for 10 min at 4°C , beads were blocked with RPMI 10 % FCS for 1 h at room tem - perature . Beads were resuspended in RPMI 10 % FCS to a con - centration of 1 ¥ 10 5 beads per microlitre . For activation of primary lymphocytes , 1 . 5 beads per cell were used and cells were incubated > 24 h for full T - cell stimulation . Puriﬁcation of Hp VacA For VacA puriﬁcation , Hp strain 60190 was cultured in Brucella broth supplemented with synthetic cholesterol solution ( 1 : 250 ; Gibco ) . VacA was puriﬁed from culture supernatant by precipita - tion with a 46 % saturated solution of ammonium sulfate and gel ﬁltration chromatography using a Sephacryl S300 16 / 60 column ( Pharmacia biotech ) . Fractions were tested for VacA by Western blot and concentrated using Amicon ultra 100 K centrifugal ﬁlter devices . Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay . All experiments were performed with acid - activated VacA preparations . Approximately 0 . 2 volumes of 300 mM HCl was added to VacA solution , incubated for 30 min at 37°C and neu - tralized with the same volume of 300 mM NaOH . Fluorescence labelling VacA was ﬂuorescently labelled using Alexa Fluor 555 / 488 - succinimidyl ester ( molecular probes ) . Labelling reaction was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Average degree of labelling was 10 – 15 mol of Alexa Fluor dye per mol VacA . Functionality of labelled VacA was determined by vacu - olization assay in Jurkat T cells . Quantiﬁcation of VacA internalization VacA internalization into CD4 + T - cells was quantiﬁed as recently described ( Sewald et al . , 2008 ) . Shortly , 400 m l of T cells ( 2 ¥ 10 5 cells ) was stimulated with 10 nM PMA for 30 min at 37°C and treated for further 20 – 30 min with the indicated inhibitors . VacA - Alexa488 ( 750 ng ml - 1 ) was added and cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C to allow internalization . Remaining VacA was removed via two washing steps with ice - cold PBS . For studies of VacA endocytosis in Jurkat , Jurkat - b 2 . 7 and Jurkat - b 2 . 7 / a L 1 ¥ 10 5 cells were used . Uptake of VacA in HeLa cell line was performed in 24 - well plate ( Nunc ) grown to 60 – 70 % conﬂuence . After adding 1 m g ml - 1 VacA - Alexa488 for 30 min at 37°C , cells were washed once with PBS . HeLa cells were trypsinized and transferred to an Eppendorf cup and treated as described for T cells . To discriminate between surface bound and internalized VacA , cells were incubated with 2 m g a - Alexa Fluor 488 antibody ( Molecular probes ) in PBS for 20 min at 4°C to quench surface ﬂuorescence . Quenching efficiency was determined as the ratio of ﬂuorescence intensity after quenching compared with total ﬂuorescence intensity and was 80 % under all conditions . Fluo - rescence was measured with a BD FACSdiva II ﬂow cytometer and data were analysed with the BD software . For quantiﬁcation the mean ﬂuorescence was used . Penetratin peptide treatments Peptides were synthesized by Genscript ( Piscataway , USA ) comprising the CD18 cytoplasmic sequence containing the TTT - motif ( Thr 758 – 760 ) for Rac - 1 / Cdc42 activation ( Nurmi et al . , 2007 ) . Peptides CD18 ( CLFKSATTTVMN ) and CD18 - ThrP ( CLFKSApTTTVMN ) correspond to residues 753 - 763 of the inte - grin CD18 chain . For transfer of the peptide fragments activated biotinylated penetratin - 1 ( MPbio ) was used . Peptides CD18 and CD18 - ThrP were linked via a disulﬁde bridge to penetratin - 1 according to manufacturer’s instruction . Coupling efficiency was checked by an 18 % SDS - PAGE ( Schaeger - Jagow ) and peptide used in experiment was adjusted according to coupled Penetratin1 - Peptide amount . Peptide transfer in primary T cells was performed by incubation of 4 ¥ 10 5 cells with 1 m M Penetratin - coupled peptides for 40 min at 37°C in RPMI / 2 % Nu - Serum . Transfer was checked by staining of the penetratin biotin - tag with Neutravidin - DyLight568 and intracellular localiza - tion by ﬂuorescence microscopy ( Olympus BX61 ) . For better visualization of the cells the actin cytoskeleton was stained with Phalloidin - Oregon green ( Molecular probes ) . After peptide trans - fection VacA endocytosis was quantiﬁed as mentioned above . As negative control cells were incubated with non - coupled cysteine - inactivated penetratin - 1 . Live cell imaging microscopy Live cell experiments were performed with an UltraView LCI spinning disk confocal system ( PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences ) ﬁtted on a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope equipped Endocytosis of VacA into primary T cells 493 © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 13 , 482 – 496 with a temperature - and CO 2 - controllable environment chamber . Images were taken with the black / white ORCA ER camera ( Hamamatsu ) . Pictures were taken using LCI UltraView software ( see above ) and edited with ImageJ software . Live cell imaging was performed in 35 mm glass bottom dishes from MatTek . For uptake experiments cells were activated with 10 nM PMA for 0 . 5 h at 37°C . VacA - Alexa488 ( 0 . 75 m g ml - 1 ) was added and incubated for 30 min at 4°C . Samples were shifted to 37°C and incubated for further 30 min . Cells were washed with PBS ( Gibco ) , resuspended in RPMI / 10 % FCS , and transferred into glass - bottom dishes ( MatTek ) . Microscopy studies were per - formed at 25°C to reduce cell motion . For localization studies HeLa cells and primary T cells were transfected with plasmids pRab7 – YFP , pRab5 – GFP , pRab11 – GFP and pLAMP1 – YFP respectively . HeLa cells were trans - fected with Fugene transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions . After transfection with 0 . 5 m g Plasmid - DNA cells were incubated for 24 h at 37°C before microscopy studies . For transfection of primary human T cells the Cell Line Nucleofector Kit L ( Amaxa biosystems ) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions .
