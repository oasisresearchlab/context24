Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center , Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine , Chicago , Illinois , United States of America Abstract Background : The targeting of the immune system through immunotherapies to prevent tumor tolerance and immune suppression are at the front lines of breast cancer treatment and research . Human and laboratory studies have attributed breast cancer progression and metastasis to secondary organs such as the bone , to a number of factors , including elevated levels of prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) and the enzyme responsible for its production , cyclooxygenase 2 ( COX2 ) . Due to the strong connection of COX2 with immune function , we focused on understanding how variance in COX2 expression manipulates the immune profile in a syngeneic , and immune - competent , mouse model of breast cancer . Though there have been correlative findings linking elevated levels of COX2 and Tregs in other cancer models , we sought to elucidate the mechanisms by which these immuno - suppressive cells are recruited to breast tumor and the means by which they promote tumor tolerance . Methodology / Principal Findings : To elucidate the mechanisms by which exacerbated COX2 expression potentiates metastasis we genetically manipulated non - metastatic mammary tumor cells ( TM40D ) to over - express COX2 ( TM40D - COX2 ) . Over - expression of COX2 in this mouse breast cancer model resulted in an increase in bone metastasis ( an observation that was ablated following suppression of COX2 expression ) in addition to an exacerbated Treg recruitment in the primary tumor . Interestingly , other immune - suppressive leukocytes , such as myeloid derived suppressor cells , were not altered in the primary tumor or the circulation . Elevated levels of PGE2 by tumor cells can directly recruit CD4 + CD25 + cells through interactions with their EP2 and / or EP4 receptors , an effect that was blocked using anti - PGE2 antibody . Furthermore , increased Treg recruitment to the primary tumor contributed to the greater levels of apoptotic CD8 + T cells in the TM40D - COX2 tumors . Conclusion / Significance : Due to the systemic effects of COX2 inhibitors , we propose targeting specific EP receptors as therapeutic interventions to breast cancer progression .

This underscores the necessity for improved treatment strategies that limit toxicity and achieve lasting tumor regression . The idea of one’s immune system surveying tumors was first suggested by Paul Ehrlich in 1909 [ 2 ] . Since then , the field of tumor immunology has sought to realize those therapeutic goals by harnessing the immune system to eliminate the body’s own cancerous cells . In contrast to this , a tumor can also manipulate the immune system to create an environment that promotes its growth , a process referred to as immuno - editing . Approaches to inhibit a tumors ability to hijack and utilize the immune system to remain undetected are very appealing therapeutic potentials still in their infancy . Initially , transformed cells divide into a growing tumor that eventually disrupts the surrounding stroma , triggering release of pro - inflammatory signals that recruit mediators of the innate immune system [ 3 ] . These cells have limited direct killing ability through various methods [ 4 , 5 ] . Immature dendritic cells are also recruited to the site , where they engulf necrotic and apoptotic tumor cells and present tumor - associated antigen ( TAA ) epitopes on MHC class II receptors to naı¨ve CD4 + T cells [ 6 ] . This activates CD4 + naı¨ve T cells that in turn release inflammatory cytokines , stimulating naı¨ve CD8 + T cells to clonally expand into TAA - specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) [ 7 ] . The activated TAA - specific CD4 + helper T cells and CTLs amass to the primary PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 September 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 9 | e46342 tumor site , where tumor - specific CTLs recognize and eliminate antigen - presenting tumor cells through secretion of perforin and induction of Fas / FasL - mediated apoptosis , while unknowingly selecting for less immunogenic tumor cells [ 8 ] . An important subset of CD4 + T cells known as regulatory T cells ( Tregs ) , are instrumental in the induction and maintenance of normal peripheral tolerance and prevention of autoimmunity [ 9 ] . Tregs play a central role in immunosuppression by directly inhibiting the function of many cells , including CD8 + T cells [ 10 ] . They suppress effector cells mainly through contact - dependent mechanisms , although Treg secretion of transforming growth factor - b ( TGF - b ) and IL - 10 have also been shown to inhibit tumor - specific CTL cytotoxicity in vivo [ 11 ] . Tregs can suppress proliferation of activated effector T cells by direct contact and induce transcriptional down - regulation of the proliferative cyto - kine IL - 2 , inhibiting their clonal expansion [ 12 ] . Additionally , Tregs can induce direct killing of effector cells through release of granzyme and perforin [ 13 , 14 ] . Notably , Tregs can function to suppress many of the host defenses utilized to prevent cancer proliferation and progression , making Treg recruitment by developing tumors a critical step in evasion of the immune response and tumor cell survival . Numerous clinical studies and animal cancer models demon - strate that tumors are able to recruit Tregs , and this is associated with advanced disease progression in gastric cancer , leukemia , non - small cell lung cancer , and breast cancer [ 15 ] . Specifically , in human breast cancer patients , the percentage of Tregs at the tumor site is positively correlated with disease progression from normal to ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) , and from DCIS to invasive carcinoma [ 16 ] . Despite the correlation of Treg accumulation and advanced cancer progression , the mechanisms by which Tregs induce progression of the tumor remain unclear . To this end , tumors are known to secrete high levels of TGF - ß , which has been shown in vitro to convert naı¨ve T cells to Tregs [ 17 ] . In addition to TGF - ß , cyclooxygenase 2 ( COX2 ) , as well as its main product , prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) have also been found to stimulate de novo Treg conversion from naı¨ve CD4 + T cells [ 18 ] . Interestingly , elevated expression of both COX2 and PGE2 have been demonstrated at the tumor site , with high levels of COX2 expression being associated with highly aggressive tumors [ 19 ] . However , though reports have correlated enhanced COX2 expression with increased levels of Tregs in breast cancer , there is no data providing evidence of the mechanism by which this occurs . In this study , we provide evidence that over - expressing COX2 ( TM40D - COX2 ) , and subsequently elevated level of PGE2 in a low - aggressive breast TM40D cancer cell line , increases the rate of bone metastasis , comparable to a highly metastatic TM40D - MB breast cancer line . In contrast , bone metastasis in the mammary tumor cell line that does not express COX2 , TM40D - MB - shCOX2 , was lost compared to the high - COX2 expressing lines ( TM40D - COX2 and TM40D - MB ) . In vitro proliferation and in vivo tumor growth rates were not affected , suggesting PGE2 - induced metastasis is not linked to a varied proliferation rate . Additionally , we show that COX2 over - expression in TM40D tumors alters their immune profile from a high infiltration of antitumor CD4 + T helper cells , to a high tumor frequency of suppressive CD4 + FoxP3 + Tregs . Enriched Tregs preferentially are recruited to the factors released in the supernatant of TM40D - COX2 and TM40D - MB cells , an effect that can be inhibited using an antibody against PGE2 . Moreover , we show that COX2 over - expressing tumors induce a higher frequency of apoptotic CD8 + T cells ; cells which have been shown in several human and animal studies to be necessary for inhibition of tumor progression and metastasis [ 20 , 21 ] . To our knowledge , this is the first evidence revealing that the regulation of COX2 can have a direct effect on bone - specific metastasis . Furthermore , subsequent PGE2 expres - sion , can influence the recruitment of Tregs , and can explain the observed increased of CD8 + T cell apoptosis in the COX2 expressing primary tumors . Others , such as work by the Ostrand - Rosenberg or the Fulton group have shown myeloid derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs ) or NK cells , respectively , as the primary immune - suppressor recruited to the tumor to promote metastasis [ 22 ] . We believe that variability in the immune profile at the primary tumor is strongly correlated to the heterogeneous properties of the tumors themselves ; though any immune suppression would be detrimental to tumor control . Combined with the published data of the negative side effects of anti - COX2 treatments , and the importance of inhibiting a pro - tumor immune tolerance , these data suggest that the treatment of breast cancer should be focused on targeting PGE2 - specific receptors . Materials and Methods Animal model and cell lines All experiments were done in accordance with protocols approved by the CCM Committee on Animal Care ( CAR ) institutional IACUC and in accordance with AAALAC . Female mice approximately 8 weeks old were used for all experiments . TM40D mammary tumor cells were derived from the FSK4 mammary epithelial cell line established in vitro from normal mouse mammary gland [ 23 ] . TM40D - MB tumor cells were isolated from bone by antibiotic selection after intracardiac injection of TM40D cells , according to a modified method by Li et al . [ 24 ] . For the TM40D - COX2 cell line , a COX2 full - length cDNA clone was purchased from ATCC and was inserted into a mammalian expression vector that was directed by an elongation factor promoter ( pEF - COX2 ) . The COX2 expression vector and a pEF empty vector were transfected into TM40D cells individually , and a pool of stable clones were harvested after 3 weeks of selection under G418 at 0 . 6 m g / ml , and were named as TM40D - C and TM40D - COX2 . COX2 over - expression in TM40D - COX2 cells was verified and compared with TM40D - C ( termed TM40D henceforth ) cells by RT - PCR analysis . COX2 was over - expressed 6 . 2 fold in TM40D - COX2 compared to TM40D - C cells as previously described [ 25 ] . To study the effects of COX2 down regulation in the highly bone - metastatic TM40D - MB cells , a retrovirus expressing a short - hairpin RNA inhibitor ( shRNA ) of COX2 was used to transduce the TM40D - MB cells ( TM40D - MB - shCOX2 ) . This resulted in significantly decreased expression of COX2 as compared to the TM40D - MB vector control and TM40D - COX2 cells ( Figure 1A ) . BALB / c - derived mammary tumor cells of very low metastatic potential , termed TM40D , the high metastatic potential TM40D - MB ( metastatic to bone ) , and the COX2 over - expressing TM40D - COX2 lines were orthotop - ically implanted into the mammary fat pads of BALB / c mice . Unlike the TM40D tumors , TM40D - MB tumors spontaneously metastasized to bone with a rate of 53 % [ 25 ] . Syngeneic mouse model of breast cancer bone metastasis For all tumor experiments , mice were injected bilaterally into the 4 th mammary fat pads with 1 6 10 6 tumor cells . Tumor volume measurements were taken every other day , and tumor volume was calculated using the formula : ( length 6 width 2 ) / 2 . Mice were euthanized when tumors reached 2 . 0 cm , the maximum size allowed according to AAALAC guidelines and the rules set by the IACUC . For detection of spontaneous bone metastasis , hind leg Tumor COX2 Promotes Breast Cancer Bone Metastasis PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 2 September 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 9 | e46342 bones were harvested and homogenized by pulverization . Cells were subsequently allowed to grow in vitro under selection of G418 . Cultured cells were further confirmed for tumor lineage by isolating genomic DNA PCR for GFP expression , an ectopic tumor marker that had been stably transfected into the tumor cells . As negative control and confirmation of tumor specificity , crushed femurs of naive animals were included in the PCR analysis . MTT assay TM40D and TM40D - COX2 cells were seeded into 96 - well plates at a density of 1 6 10 3 cells per well and incubated in DMEM medium containing 5 % FBS . Cells were incubated for 4 hours with MTT ( Sigma Chemical Co . , USA , 5 mg / ml ) . Then the supernatant was removed and DMSO was added . Absorbance at 570 nm ( A570 ) and DMSO ( SigmaChemical Co . , USA ) was measured with a microplate reader ( Model 550 , Bio - Rad , USA ) . Actual absorbance = absorbance of the experimental group – absorbance of DMSO . Fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) analysis At maximum tumor size , spleen and tumor were excised and homogenized to obtain single cell suspensions , and erythrocytes were lysed as previously described [ 26 ] . To test for immune cell recruitment in spleen and tumor , 2 6 10 6 cells from each sample were pre - incubated with anti - CD16 / CD32 ( 2 . 4G2 , eBioscience ) to avoid non - specific binding of antibodies to Fc c R . Cells were stained with the following fluorophore - conjugated anti - mouse monoclonal antibodies : anti - CD4 , anti - CD25 , anti - FoxP3 , anti - CD8 a , anti - CD45R , anti - Ly6G , anti - Ly6C , anti - F4 / 80 , or anti - CD11b ( BD Biosciences ) . To exclude dead cells from analysis , cells were stained with LIVE / DEAD fixable violet blue ( Invitrogen ) . Cells were sorted on a FACS Canto II ( BD Biosciences ) and analyzed using FlowJo software ( Tree Star ) . Enrichment of GFP - FoxP3 + Tregs Tregs were enriched from splenocytes of healthy , unchallenged 7 week - old wild - type BALB / c mice using the regulatory T cell isolation kit ( MACS , Miltenyi Biotec ) protocol provided and as previously described [ 27 ] . Briefly , to remove splenocytes of B cells and myeloid cells , splenocytes were incubated with biotin - B220 ( BD Biosciences ) or biotin - CD11b ( BD Biosciences ) , respectively , followed by streptavidin microbead magnetic column depletion ( MACS , Miltenyi Biotec ) . Enrichment of CD4 + cells isolated from splenocytes was confirmed by FACS . GFP - FoxP3 + Tregs were then isolated ( . 96 % purity ) using a Beckman Coulter MoFlo ( Beckman Coulter , USA ) and cells were processed as necessary . Figure 1 .

Antigen retrieval was done using 1 6 Target retrieval solution ( DAKO ) and incubated with BSA for 30 minutes at room temperature . Sections were then incubated either primary antibodies anti - mouse CD4 ( Abcam ) , anti - mouse CD8 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , anti - mouse FoxP3 ( eBiosciences ) , or Cleaved Caspase - 3 ( Cell Signaling ) overnight at 4 u C . For IF , the slides were washed twice with PBS and incubated with Alexaflour - 594 and Alexafluor - 488 secondary antibodies ( Invitrogen ) , and counter - stained with DAPI . For IHC , the slides were washed with PBS and incubated for 15 minutes with 4 9 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( Sigma ) , then washed with PBS and mounted with antifade mounting medium . Images were acquired using Zeiss Axiovert microscope ( Zeiss , Germany ) and Axiovision Rel . 4 . 5 Analysis System ( Zeiss , Germany ) . RNA extraction and RT - PCR RNA was harvested from purified CD4 + FoxP3 + Tregs ( Rneasy kit , Qiagen ) and RT - PCR was performed on reverse - transcribed cDNA ( Superscript II , Invitrogen ) using primers for the murine EP1 , EP2 , EP3 , and EP4 genes and GAPDH was used as a control for relative levels of total RNA , as previously described [ 28 ] . The following primers were used to amplify mouse EP1 gene : 5 9 - TAG TGT GCA ATA CGC TCA GCG - 3 9 and 3 9 - GAG GTG ACT GAA ACC ACT GTG GGA CCA AGG CTT CAG AGA G - 5 9 , EP2 gene : 5 9 - GTG GCC CTG GCT CCC GAA AGT C - 3 9 and 3 9 - GGC AAG GAG CAT ATG GCG AAG GTG - 5 9 , EP3 gene : 5 9 - GGC ACG TGG TGC TTC ATC - 3 9 and 3 9 - GGG ATC CAA GAT CTG GTT - 5 9 , and EP4 gene : 5 9 - CGT AGT ATT GTG CAA GTC GC - 3 9 and 3 9 - GGC GAT GAG TAA GAT GAC CA - 5 9 . These result in bands of 553 , 535 , 416 , and 720 bp , respectively . Primers for human GAPDH were used as described previously [ 26 ] . Amplified products were visualized on an agarose gel . Migration Assay Tregs were separated from naı¨ve mouse thymus and lymph nodes using PE - conjugated CD25 ( BD Biosciences ) , biotinylated CD4 , streptavidin and anti - PE magnetic MACS beads ( Miltenyi Biotec ) and a MACS LS column ( Miltenyi Biotec ) . The purity of Tregs isolated was checked using FACS . For the migration assay , the upper chamber of 5 m m uncoated 96 - well ChemoTX system ( Neuro Probe , Gaithersburg , MD ) was used . Isolated Tregs were resuspended in RPMI containing 2 % serum at 10 6 / ml concen - tration and seeded in triplicates on the top well in 20 m l . The bottom well was loaded in triplicate with 29 m l of media plus 5 % serum ( negative control ) , conditioned medium obtained from TM40D , TM40D - COX2 , or TM40D - MB cells , or TM40D - COX2 medium containing anti - PGE2 . After 4 hour incubation at 37 u C , cells that migrated into the lower chamber were fixed with 1 % paraformaldahyde , imaged by microscope with attached camera ( Leica ) and quantified using Image J software .

Results COX2 promotes tumor progression in a syngeneic orthotopic transplantation model of breast cancer Previous work from our laboratory has shown that the highly metastatic TM40D - MB breast cancer cell line has greater than a 4 - fold increase in COX2 expression [ 25 ] . Manipulation of the low - metastatic TM40D mammary cancer cell line to over - express COX2 ( TM40D - COX2 ) resulted in an increase in PGE2 production and exacerbated bone degradation due to an increase in osteoclast formation , an effect which was abrogated by treatment of the TM40D - COX2 cells with the COX2 inhibitor NS - 398 [ 25 ] . Additionally , levels of COX2 were similar between TM40D - COX2 and TM40D - MB , 6 – 7 times higher than TM40D , and 25 times higher than TM40D - MB - shCOX2 when compared by quantitative RT - PCR ( Figure 1A ) . We therefore wanted to directly assess the effects of COX2 - modulated tumor cells on tumor progression using our syngeneic mouse model of mammary cancer metastasis . To determine the presence of tumor cells in bone , we employed the use of antibiotic selection of pulverized ex vivo bone isolated from tumor - challenged mice , grown in vitro and followed by PCR analysis of the cultured cells to detect the presence of the green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) , an ectopic tumor marker that had been stably transfected into the tumor cells . We observed nearly a five - fold increase in bone metastasis occurring from the primary TM40D - COX2 tumor ( 50 % ) compared to the bone metastasis occurring from the TM40D ( control vector ) tumor ( 11 % ) or TM40D - MB - shCOX2 ( 0 % ) , validating the metastasis - promoting action of COX2 in our mammary tumors ( Figure 1B , p , 0 . 05 ) . The metastasis to bone observed in the TM40D - COX2 was similar to the rate of metastasis occurring from the highly aggressive TM40D - MB line ( 56 % ) . Importantly , metastasis to bone appeared to be directly associated with elevated levels of COX2 , as analysis of the brain , lung , and liver did not show variation in metastatic rates between the mice challenged with TM40D versus TM40D - COX2 ( data not shown ) . To address whether the increased rate of metastasis was attributed to differences in proliferation between TM40D and TM40D - COX2 , we compared in vitro cell proliferation and in vivo tumor growth between the groups . For in vitro proliferation experiments TM40D and TM40D - COX2 cell proliferation was compared by MTT assay for 72 hours ( Figure 1C ) . Additionally , for the in vivo tumor growth analysis , TM40D and TM40D - COX2 tumor cells were implanted into the mammary fat pads of BALB / c mice and monitored for tumor growth ( Figure 1D ) . We subsequently assessed the differences in time between TM40D and TM40D - COX2 tumor growth to maximum tumor size . Both TM40D and TM40D - COX2 tumors became palpable in the second week , and were all sacrificed in the fifth week following challenge with no differences in growth patterns . These data reveal that the differences in metastatic potential between TM40D and TM40D - COX2 are not due to variations in proliferation in vitro or in vivo . This suggests that there may be differences in the tumor microenvironment that induce variation in metastatic potential . TM40D - COX2 tumors promote a suppressive immune profile compared to TM40D tumors Several recent studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between tumor metastasis and elevated levels of Tregs in various Tumor COX2 Promotes Breast Cancer Bone Metastasis PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 4 September 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 9 | e46342 cancers , including breast [ 16 , 29 – 32 ] . Cytokines , chemokines , and other factors such as COX2 can potentiate Treg recruitment or differentiation from naı¨ve CD4 + cells . For our subsequent experiments , at the experimental endpoint , spleen and primary tumor were isolated and homogenized into a cell suspension for flow cytometry analysis . The data revealed that neither splenic ( data not shown ) or tumor CD4 + T cells ( yielding about 35 % of the immune profile ) and CD8 + T cells ( yielding about 10 % ) were altered due to COX2 expression ( Figure 2A ) . Due to potential immune suppression by other cells , such as MDSCs , we characterized the tumor infiltration of myeloid - derived cells . Specifically , no differential recruitment of immature monocytes ( CD11b + F4 / 80 + Ly6G + ) , tumor associate macrophages ( TAMs ) ( CD11b + F4 / 80 + Ly6G 2 ) , granulocytic - myeloid derived sup - pressor cells ( G - MDSCs ) ( CD11b + Ly6C low Ly6G + ) , or monocyt - ic - MDSCs ( M - MDSCs ) ( CD11b + Ly6C hi Ly6G 2 ) in the primary Figure 2 .

Over - expression of COX2 in the primary tumor was found to significantly attenuate splenic levels of Tregs by nearly 30 % in mice challenged with TM40D - COX2 tumors , compared to mice with TM40D tumors ( Figure 2C and D , p , 0 . 05 ) . In contrast , increase tumor densities of Tregs , measured by surface markers CD4 and CD25 plus intracellular FoxP3 , as compared to TM40D control ( Figure 2E and F ) , suggestive of a shift of the Treg population from the circulation to the primary tumor . Thus , modulation of tumor COX2 expression dramatically alters the recruitment of suppressive Tregs to both primary tumor sites . In the tumor microenvironment , these findings were validated and confirmed by immunohistochemistry . Histological sections stained with H & E showed a varied profile between the TM40D and TM40D - COX2 tumors ( Figure 3A and 3B , respectively ) . Specifically , the TM40D - COX2 tumors showed increased het - erogeneity , with regions of exacerbated necrotic regions in the COX2 - overexpressing tumors . To validate our FACS data , fluorescent immunostaining was performed on tumor sections . Sections were stained with anti - CD4 ( red ) and anti - FoxP3 ( green ) Tregs ( arrows ) in the TM40D and TM40D - COX2 tumors ( Figure 3C and 3D , respectively ) . Analysis of the fluorescent immunohistochemistry showed the Tregs had infiltrated the TM40D - COX2 tumors at a significantly higher rate compared to the TM40D tumors ( Figure 3E , p , 0 . 05 ) . These data suggest there is a means by which the over - expression of PGE2 can induce Treg recruitment from the circulation to the primary tumor . Tregs expressing the PGE2 receptors EP2 and EP4 are preferentially recruited to factors expressed by TM40D - COX2 tumor cells With increased Treg recruitment to the tumors over - expressing PGE2 , we sought to gain an understanding of whether the increased frequency of Tregs was due to the direct recruitment of natural Tregs ( nTregs ) , explaining the loss of Tregs observed in the circulation ( Figure 2E and F ) or the de novo conversion of CD4 + T cells into inducible Tregs ( iTregs ) in the TM40D - COX2 Figure 3 .

In order to assess whether Tregs can be recruited to the tumor by factors released by the TM40D - COX2 cells , CD4 + CD25 + Tregs were enriched by magnetic column ( MACS ) from naı¨ve thymus and lymph nodes ( Figure 4A ) . Subsequently , the rate of migration into cell - free supernatants from control media or harvested supernatant from TM40D , TM40D - COX2 , or TM40D - MB cultures was measured ( Figure 4B ) . Frequencies of migrated Tregs were found significantly elevated in the TM40D - COX2 and the TM40D - MB group , as compared to the TM40D group ( p , 0 . 01 ) , which itself was elevated compared to control media ( p , 0 . 05 ) . Furthermore , addition of anti - PGE2 to TM40D - COX2 media completely ablated the chemotactic potential observed with the TM40D - COX2 media alone , reduc - ing the number of migrating Tregs to the level observed with the TM40D media ( Figure 4B ) . The ability to inhibit the preferential migration of Tregs to the TM40D - COX2 media via an antibody to PGE2 suggests that these Tregs have PGE2 receptors . Splenocytes isolated from naı¨ve BALB / c mice were isolated and depleted of CD11b + myeloid cells by magnetic bead separation . Specifically , enriched CD4 + lymphocytes were positively selected and GFP - FoxP3 + Tregs were purified by FACS resulting in populations of . 96 % purity ( Figure 4C ) . The Treg RNA was isolated and RT - PCR of the PGE2 receptors , EP1 - 4 , was performed ( Figure 4D ) . Similar to the naive CD4 + T cell parent previously published , CD4 + FoxP3 + Tregs retain a high level expression of EP2 and a lower level expression of EP4 . PGE2 receptors EP1 and EP3 were not expressed in the Tregs . Thus , modulation of COX2 expression in these tumor cells has a direct effect on their ability to recruit Tregs , potential suppressors of the immune response . Increased Tregs in COX2 - expressing TM40D tumors are paralleled by elevated of apoptotic CD8 + cells Once recruited , the potential role of Tregs and their subsequent immune - suppressive capabilities were assessed . As previously reported , Tregs have the potential to exercise their immunosup - pressive function by suppressing the immune response of many cells [ 33 ] . Additionally , Tregs have been shown to induce CD8 + T cell apoptosis [ 34 ] . Therefore , via immunofluorescence staining of TM40D and TM40D - COX2 tumors , we determined whether COX2 modulation would affect tumor CD8 + T cell function by measuring for apoptosis ( Figure 5A and 5B ) . Analysis of CD8 + T cells ( red ) , with co - localization of cleaved caspase - 3 ( green ) revealed that the tumor density of CD8 + T cells undergoing apoptosis , measured as the percent of CD8 + cells that are cleaved caspase - 3 + , was significantly higher in the COX2 - overexpressing TM40D - COX2 group compared to the TM40D tumors Figure 4 . PGE2 directly involved in inducing Treg migration . CD4 + CD25 + Tregs were enriched by magnetic column ( MACS ) from naı¨ve thymus and lymph nodes ( A ) . Treg migration was measured using media alone , cell - free supernatant collected from TM40D , TM40D - COX2 , or TM40D - MB cells ( B ) . Additionally , the role of PGE2 was assessed by anti - PGE2 blocking antibody added to TM40D - COX2 media . Purified GFP - FoxP3 + cells were isolated from spleen following CD4 + T cell enrichment ( C ) and analyzed for expression of the PGE2 receptors EP1 , EP2 , EP3 , or EP4 via RT - PCR with GAPDH as a control ( D ) . # p , 0 . 05 , * p , 0 . 01 compared to Media alone , N = 3 samples per group . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0046342 . g004 Tumor COX2 Promotes Breast Cancer Bone Metastasis PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 7 September 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 9 | e46342 ( Figure 5C , p , 0 . 01 ) . Interestingly , analysis of these tumors revealed regional distribution of apoptotic CD8 + cells in the tumor , showing sections of CD8 T cells as either all caspase 3 + or all caspase 3 - in the COX2 - overexpressing tumors . This may be attributed to the heterogeneous morphology and increased necrotic regions in the TM40D - COX2 tumors . Confirmed here , and as reported in Figure 2 , there were no differences in total levels of CD8 + T cells and a small increase in total apoptotic cells , which can be attributed to the increase in apoptotic CD8 + cells in TM40D - COX2 versus TM40D tumors ( data not shown ) . Thus , exacerbated tumor COX2 expression induces significant CD8 + T cell apoptosis , thereby disabling a potent mediator of antitumor immunity . Discussion Increased COX2 or Treg accumulation in primary breast tumor is correlated , both clinically and in laboratory models , to increased metastasis . Additionally , clinical studies of lung , neck , gastric , and breast cancer patients have shown a correlation between increased COX2 expression with high Treg recruitment [ 18 , 35 – 37 ] . These findings are often coupled to enhanced tumor progression in the patients with high COX2 and Tregs . Until now , there has not been any study showing a direct link between the increased Tregs in aggressive breast tumors and elevated COX2 expression . In our model of breast cancer metastasis we detected a significant up - regulation of COX2 in the highly metastatic TM40D - MB cells , as compared to the low - metastatic TM40D cells . We hypothesized that tumors may acquire a selective advantage by up - regulating expression of COX2 ; thereby evading T - cell mediated immune surveillance and promoting metastatic cancer progression . By developing a COX2 over - expressing mammary cancer cell line ( TM40D - COX2 ) , we now provide evidence that metastasis can be exacerbated through variable COX2 / PGE2 expression , potentially explained by a PGE2 - induced Treg recruitment to the tumor , and subsequent induction of CD8 + T cell apoptosis . Furthermore , elevated expression of COX2 ( 6 – 7 fold increase compared to TM40D - vector control ) was sufficient to target metastasis to bone , as metastasis to brain , lung , and liver were not variable . In contrast the bone - specific metastasis was ablated following suppression of COX2 expression in the highly metastatic TM40D - MB cells ( TM40D - MB - shCOX2 ) . To our knowledge , this is the first study to show direct evidence that COX2 over - expression , and subsequent PGE2 production , promotes direct Treg recruitment and controls bone - specific metastasis . COX2 expression has been linked to cancer progression due to its role in facilitating pro - angiogenic gene expression and angiogenesis , enhancing cell proliferation , inducing aromatase expression , and depressing the immune system [ 19 , 38 , 39 ] . Herein , we provide evidence that COX2 , and subsequent PGE2 over - expression , results in a tumor environment that promotes Treg recruitment and attenuation of the normal immune response . The effect on Treg immune suppression was not attributed to differences in tumor burden , as all mice were euthanized at the same tumor volume . Furthermore , over - expression of COX2 in TM40D - COX2 cells had no effect on primary tumor growth in vivo or in vitro , but mice implanted with these tumors demonstrated significantly increased tumor levels of Tregs and a significant increase in spontaneous bone metastasis . Additionally , due to the Figure 5 . TM40D - COX2 tumors have increased apoptotic CD8 + T cells . Histological sections of TM40D and TM40D - COX2 tumors were stained with AlexaFluor 594 for CD8 ( RED ) AlexaFluor 488 for Cleaved Caspase 3 ( ClCasp3 + ) ( GREEN ) , and Dapi for nucleus ( BLUE ) ( A and B , respectively ) .

It is important to note that we did not observe any differences in vascularity when comparing histological sections of the tumors ( data not shown ) , suggesting COX2 is working through mechanisms not involving angiogenesis or cell proliferation . Other mechanisms of action may include increased Treg migration from the circulation or Treg differentiation in the tumor from CD4 + T cells . These results point to the detrimental effect of COX2 expression by tumor in promoting Treg - mediated antitumor immunity . In murine models , depletion of CD4 + CD25 + T cells signifi - cantly augments the efficacy of cancer vaccination , underscoring the role of these cells in suppressing the immune responses against cancer cells [ 40 , 41 ] . Herein , we show that Tregs are recruited to low - metastatic TM40D tumors and preferentially recruited to highly metastatic TM40D - COX2 tumors over - expressing COX2 , and subsequently PGE2 . We provide evidence that support a PGE2 - specific recruitment of Tregs to the tumor from the circulation . Primary CD4 + CD25 + T cells isolated from mouse thymus and lymph nodes preferentially migrate to media containing higher levels of PGE2 , which is ablated with a PGE2 - specific antibody . The response to PGE2 is not surprising as Tregs express both the EP2 and EP4 receptors . The EP receptors are known G protein - coupled receptors ; EP2 and EP4 are stimulatory G a S receptors , EP1 is a G a Q receptor , and EP3 is a G a I / O receptor . Although many manuscripts have published that all receptors have been associated with inducing and inhibiting tumor and immune cell migration depending on the cell stimulated , the use of receptor antagonists to EP2 and EP4 have been shown to inhibit breast cancer progression [ 42 ] . Furthermore , induction of the EP1 receptor has been shown to also suppress breast cancer metastasis , suggesting the inhibition of the stimulating PGE2 receptors or induction of the inhibitory PGE2 receptor can attenuate breast cancer progression [ 43 ] . Alternatively , Treg accumulation in a tumor could be due to differentiation from naı¨ve T cells from the periphery . A study by Yuan et al . showed that in the gastric cancer microenvironment , PGE2 could induce FoxP3 expression independently of TGF - b and IL - 10 [ 44 ] . Additionally , others have shown that the PGE2 - induced Treg conversion from naı¨ve CD4 + cells requires the EP receptors . Specifically , FoxP3 expression was significantly reduced in the absence of the EP4 receptor and ablated in the absence of the EP2 receptor expression following exposure to PGE2 [ 18 ] . Although studies have shown that PGE2 alone can directly induce FoxP3 expression [ 18 ] , we believe there are many mechanisms , including directly recruiting Tregs to the tumor , which can ultimately manipulate the immune system to promote an immune - suppressive environment . Our study provides evidence that increased Treg recruitment to the tumor is correlated with increased levels of CD8 + cells undergoing apoptosis . Previous studies have revealed that expo - sure to PGE2 induced prevention of direct and cross priming of antitumor CD8 + T cell responses to tumor cells in vivo [ 45 ] . We extend our understanding of the detrimental role PGE2 plays in the immune response by showing CD8 + T cells undergo increased level of caspase 3 cleavage in tumors expressing high levels of COX2 . We believe this may be a direct effect of the recruitment of Tregs to the tumor , as Tregs have been shown to promote CD8 + T cell apoptosis . Further investigation into cytokine production is warranted for a complete understanding of the mechanisms of the Treg - CD8 T cell interaction [ 34 ] . Not surprisingly , we observed the increased CD8 + cleaved caspase 3 + cells in specific localized lymphoid - rich sections of the tumor , rather than a diffuse localization . This has been observed by others , including a recent publication which describes Tregs , and the effects of Tregs , at sites of lymphoid aggregates in breast tumors [ 46 ] . Due to published data having attributed increased Treg accumulation to blocking CD4 / CD8 T cell , NK cell , and DC - mediated immune response ( for review see [ 33 ] , we believe targeting upstream of Treg recruitment would result in beneficial response to breast cancer progression . COX2 has been shown to play an important role in influencing other immune suppressive cells during tumor progression . Specifically , COX2 - induced PGE2 expression has been shown to promote MDSC accumulation in human and rodent cancers [ 47 , 48 ] . Additionally , studies by the laboratory of Ostrand - Rosenberg have shown that PGE2 induce the differentiation of MDSCs from the bone marrow stem cells and receptor antagonist block the differentiation [ 22 ] . Furthermore , mice with EP2 knockout inoculated with 4T1 mammary carcinoma displayed delayed tumor growth and reduced numbers of MDSC compared to wild - type mice . Though our data does not show differences in the numbers of either monocytic or granulocytic MDSCs in response to the varied levels of COX2 / PGE2 expression , we cannot comment on the activation state of the MDSCs residing in their respective tumor environments . Alternatively , increased COX2 / PGE2 expression in breast cancer can also influence the activation state of immune cells . For example , breast cancer patients with elevated levels of COX2 and PGE2 within the tumor and the circulation presented T cells with decreased proliferation in response to CD3 antibody stimulation , reduced levels of TNF - a , interleukin ( IL ) - 12 , IL - 2 , and increased levels of IL - 10 and IL - 4 . Additionally , dendritic cells from these patients showed signifi - cantly reduced B7 and CD40 expression as well as attenuated phagocytic ability [ 37 ] . These findings , coupled with our current data , suggest there are numerous pathways through which COX2 / PGE2 can influence the immune profile of breast cancer . An explanation for these alternative consequences may have to do with the influence PGE2 has on the cytokine , chemokine , and growth factor production it is inducing in both the tumor cells as well as the recruited immune cells . Therefore , targeting the source of the initial immune - editing , specifically PGE2 , would be encouraged to bypass the various downstream results of elevated COX2 expression . Targeting COX2 as the therapeutic means of treating breast cancer has been the focus of both clinical and laboratory investigations . Recently , many findings have suggested that the inhibition of COX2 promotes many undesirable cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects to patients , even taken on a short - term basis . This may be due , in part , to inhibition in not only the production of prostaglandin E2 , but also be a loss in the synthesis of prostaglandin D2 and F2R , as well as the cardio - protective prostacyclin ( PGI2 ) and thromboxane A2 , upon suppressing COX2 [ 49 ] . Specifically targeting one of the many downstream effectors of COX2 , suggest a potential decrease in potential side effects when treating breast cancer patients , as well as others taking COX2 inhibitors for non - cancer diseases . Due to the removal of primary tumors from most patients soon after diagnosis , the utilization of anti - EP receptor therapy would be a beneficial treatment in targeting metastatic breast tumor cells overexpressing COX2 . First , it may prevent the establishment of the tumor cells to secondary sites by inhibiting the recruitment of immune - suppressive Tregs , therefore allowing the ‘normal’ robust immune response necessary to clear cancer cells . Second it could decrease morbidity involved with breast cancer metastasis to the bone , specifically osteolytic bone lesions following metastasis by sup - pressing the COX2 / PGE2 - mediated action on osteoblasts , ulti - mately leading to the inhibition of osteoclast function . Based on Tumor COX2 Promotes Breast Cancer Bone Metastasis PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 9 September 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 9 | e46342 the current data , future studies will focus on utilizing antagonists that are not only specific to PGE2 , but rather to specific sub - receptors of PGE2 , specifically EP2 and EP4 receptors , to treat breast cancer progression .
