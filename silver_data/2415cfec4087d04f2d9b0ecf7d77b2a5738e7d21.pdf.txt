Supporting Early Design Through Conjoint Trends Analysis Methods and the TRENDS System Carole Bouchard and Jean - François Omhover Abstract This paper introduces methods and tool support to enrich the early design activity , especially in what we call the informational phase , where inspiration sources are of crucial importance . The Conjoint Trends Analysis method is put forward as a way to structure and operationalize the informational phase of early design ; a model of the design process underpinning the method is introduced and guidelines are provided for its application in an industrial context . Based upon studies of designer’s activity during early design formal models of this process have been created that have been used for a partial digitalization of the informational phase of design in the TRENDS system . Introduction Modeling the Early Design Process Researchers in design science tend to model the design process in order to optimize it . The design process is mostly shown into linear sequential steps ( Pahl and Beitz 1984 ; Andreasen and Hein 1987 ; Jones 1992 ; Hubka and Eder 1996 ; Ullman 1997 ; Baxter 1995 ; Ulrich 2000 ; Cross 2000 ; Dorst and Cross 2001 ; Howard et al . 2008 ) . Some other models describe it as the succession of elementary design cycles ( Lebahar 1993 ; Gero and Kannengiesser 2004 ; Boehm 1988 ; Blessing 1994 ; Roozenburg and Eckels 1995 ) , which may also represent divergence and convergence ( Van Der Lugt 2003 ; Design Council 2007 ) , or the transition from an abstract space to a concrete one ( Suh 1999 ; Tichkiewitch et al . 1995 ) . As early design , we consider both phases of Planning and Concepts Development ( Ulrich 2000 ) . These phases are mostly implicit until the concepts are ﬁxed . Indeed , there are not or not systematically some explicit representations which are produced by the designers at this stage . Only in a very formalized process , for instance in C .

Omhover car design , designers elaborate some moodboards . Despite its implicit character , the early design process is strategic for future product development and for the optimization of the design process ( Cross 2000 ; Zeiler et al . 2007 ) . It is the place where major conceptual orientations are ﬁxed with still high divergence capability for low costs . In order to optimize the digital chain ( Computer Aided Design , Product Data Management , Product Life Cycle Management ) , the goal is currently to develop new computer support tools for the phase of early design . Among the various models of design , few of them propose a description of this speciﬁc phase . This description is by nature difﬁcult because early design information is rather implicit , vague and ill - deﬁned ( Eastman 1969 ; Simon 1973 ) . Information here encompasses a big diversity of heterogeneous data encompassing complex notions such as semantics , emotions and feelings . Besides , the ﬁrst representations reﬂect poorly the cognitive and affective processes involved . Studying early design activity has enabled us to explicate skills , knowledge and expert rules that are come into play during early design . These studies showed the importance of the semantic and emotional dimensions into the design process ( Bouchard et al . 2007a ; Kim et al . 2008 ) . Modeling the early design process is necessary to improve the whole CAD - CAM chain . We propose here an information processing model of the early design activity which was translated in a methodology and some design tools that have been experienced and validated in industry . This model is structured into four phases of information , generation , evaluation and materialization ( see Fig . 1 ) . According to the model , the design process is a succession of micro - cycles including the phases of information , generation , evaluation and materialization , which enable a progressive concretization . Indeed the design process can be seen as the succession of iterative cycles , each following the four stages of information , generation , evaluation and materialization . The information phase corresponds to the integration of inspiration sources and data by the designers . The generation phase consists in ideas and concepts generation through applied creativity . The best solutions are chosen according to the brief’s criteria in an analytical way . The evaluation phase is based on the Problem space Solution space Operating mode Data processing Information Generation Evaluation Materialisation Problem / solution space Fig . 1 Model of information processing in early design , From problem space to solution space ( top ) through a succession of divergence , convergence , and materialization phases ( bottom ) Supporting Early Design Through Conjoint Trends Analysis Methods . . . 55 Problem space Solution space Operating mode Data processing Information Generation Evaluation Materialisation Problem / solution space Fig . 2 Formalization of the information phase measure of the user experience ( perceptive , cognitive , affective aspects , usability and usefulness ) through various levels of materialization with digital or physical prototypes and representations . If so far the phases of generation and evaluation have been well studied , in particular sketching semantic evaluation of intermediate representations , the information phase was less studied because of its implicit character . On the other hand , if creative process is well modeled in detail design , for instance with the Triz approach , it is not the case yet in early design . The link between the informative and generative phases is neither yet well established . As the materialization phase is well covered in many scientiﬁc ﬁelds and engineering , the research presented here is more about the three ﬁrst ones which are less modeled yet ( Fig . 2 ) . Computer - Aided Design Tools in Early Design The concepts development phase is modeled in order to develop new computer aided design tools ( Tovey 1992 , 1994a , b , 1997 ; Tovey and Owen 2000 ; Tovey et al . 2003 ; Scrivener and Clark 1994a ) . Modeling this phase also helps to support or to improve individual and collective creativity in design ( Koestler 1964 ; Lewis 1988 ; Lewis 1995 ; Vangundy 1992 ; De Bono 1995 ; Isaksen et al . 2000 ; Bonnardel 2000 ; Syrett and Lammiman 2002 ; Alberti et al . 2007 ; Buzan 2009 ) . Sketches have been considered as the main media for concepts elaboration and evaluation ( Schön 1983 ; Tovey et al . 2003 ; Van Der Lugt , 2000 , 2001 , 2003 , 2005 ) . The ﬁeld of sketching and shape generation is still strongly studied , both in architecture and product design ( Schön 1992 ; Scrivener and Clark 1994b ; Do et al . 2000 ; Van der Lugt 2005 ; Goldschmidt 1994 ; Goldschmidt and Tatsa 2005 ; Goldschmidt and Smolkov 2006 ; Suwa and Tversky 1997 ; Purcell and Gero 1998 ; Bilda and Gero 2007 ) . Besides , another ﬁeld of research has been about concepts evaluation , with semantic analysis ( Osgood et al . 1957 ; Osgood 1979 ) , later sensory analysis , and more recently emotional and experience evaluation ( Smets and Overbeeke 1995 ; Norman 2004 ; Green and Jordan 2001 ; Desmet 2002 , 2008 ; Desmet and Schifferstein 2010 ) . User 56 C . Bouchard and J . - F . Omhover centered design has been mostly popularized by ( Don Norman 1998 ) in the ﬁeld of products and services . Even if the research related to the generative phase of design is well modeled and disseminated , this is not yet the case of the inspirational phase which , despite its implicit character ( Eckert and Stacey 1998 , 2000 ; Büscher et al . 2000 ; McDonagh and Denton 2005 ) , plays a crucial role in the creative process . Computer aided design and manufacturing tools are well utilized by industry during the detail design ( Hsiao and Liu 2002 ) . The progressive digitization of the design process increasingly compresses the transition from design towards product development . Further gains in shortening the length of the design process and the time to market needs now to address early design phases . Early design modeling is harder because of its subjective , and also affective , implicit and fuzzy character . Kansei engineering has been shown to provide a scientiﬁc framework for the elaboration of new digital tools , with the integration of semantics and emotions . It has develop tools and algorithms for design generation and evaluation ( Nagamachi 2002 ; Berthouze and Hayashi 2002 ; Hayashi and Hagiwara 1997 ; Hsiao and Liu 2002 ; Ishihara et al . 1995 ; Schütte 2005 ; Schütte et al . 2006 ) . Tool support can speed up changes and decrease design time by allowing designers to shift attention from less creative and laborious tasks to the most creative ones ( Resnick 2007 ) in Kim et al . ( 2009 ) . Formalization of the Information Phase The Information Phase in Early Design The information phase covers the inspirational process , the watch actions , and all the explorations carried out to complete the design brief . This phase stimulates the emergence of new ideas and concepts . Inspiration search is performed through spe - ciﬁc sectors of inﬂuence via various media such as the web , magazines , exhibitions , etc . The selection of relevant images is depending on color harmonies , style , object type , emotional impact , semantics and values . Designers operate a watch process going from a simple observation in their everyday life to the regular consultation of specialized data ( Bouchard 1997 ) . Even if modeling the designers’ cognitive activity is of growing interest , the information phase has been less studied so far ( Eckert and Stacey 2000 ) . This phase enables to inform the generation of new solutions by refer - ring to precedents and other sources ( Lloyd and Snelders 2003 ) . It follows a volun - tary action of more or less focused research which is necessary for problem under - standing ( Cross 2000 ) , goals deﬁnition ( Wallas 1926 ; Schneiderman 2000 ; Amabile 1983 ) and functional adequacy ( Osborn 1963 ; Schneiderman 2000 ) . This phase involves analogical reasoning , with the extraction of design elements from adjacent sectors which are then transferred into the reference sector during concepts genera - tion . Knowing that creative thinkers use more environmental data ( Ansburg and Hill 2003 ) , the degree of novelty of solutions is highly linked to this phase . Inspiration sources play a major role in contextual deﬁnition ( Eckert and Stacey 2000 ) . They Supporting Early Design Through Conjoint Trends Analysis Methods . . . 57 stimulate creativity and support mental representation . They may be more or less far from the reference sector and related to functional , structural or affective dimensions ( Bonnardel and Marmeche 2005 ; Lim et al . 2006 ) . Design Information and Expert Rules Design information may be categorized in high - level ( semantic , emotional , sensory descriptors , sociological values ) , middle - level ( concepts , sector names ) or low - level information ( shape , color , texture ) . The use of abstraction levels opens the way to apply formalisms originating from the ﬁelds of artiﬁcial intelligence ( Black et al . 2004 ; Bouchard et al . 2009 ) and of marketing ( Valette - Florence and Rapacchi 1990 ; Valette - Florence 1993a , b , 1994 ) . It also reﬂects the expert rules implemented by the designers , who have this very particular ability to link reciprocally high - levels of abstraction of information with very concrete object attributes . In the ﬁeld of marketing , the method of cognitive chaining of means - ends ( Valette - Florence 1994 ; Bouchard et al . 2007b ) aims at formalizing the relation between high - level and low - level information with a chain of values - functions - attributes . We investigated the value - function - attributes chain in the framework of car design projects . For instance , to improve a technological innovation on the dashboard , design orientations were the following : family , cohesion , family unit , cocooning , peace , smoothness . Designers’ categorization processes are poorly referenced in literature ( Büscher et al . 2000 ; Bianchi - Berthouze and Hayashi 2002 ) . However designers use inten - sively grouping strategies according to particular harmonies of color , texture , shape , semantics . The difﬁculty to understand this cognitive operation comes from its subjectivity , multi - dimensionality , and also from the holistic nature of visual information . Designers build more or less implicitly categories or sub - categories of visual , lexical or multi - sensory information . The categorization task requires a special expertise . Categories are speciﬁc . Their consistency is due to the coherence of the different Kansei dimensions ( shape , colors , textures , semantics , values ) , but also the homogeneity between semantics and low - level features , and the presence of harmonies . Designers build some ambiences from these categories and sub - categories , from which they will extract relevant harmonies that they reuse in the futures solutions . Images are ﬁrst groups by color harmonies , then shape and texture . Going from words to images , or vice - versa , is very ﬂuid and dynamic . The categories are then annotated with a name and some keywords . Harmony rules apply to colors , textures or shapes , and their relation to semantics ( Bouchard et al . 2009 ) . In the example shown Fig . 3 , we recognize a common color harmony revealed by the presence of very saturated purples , pinks , oranges , in the set of images . Shapes similarities are also particular with rounded forms , like distorted plastics : : : Speciﬁc keywords come into our mind when watching these images : pop , inspired by seventies , plastics : : : There may be sub - categories . For instance there is chic and luxurious version of pop characterized by shiny textures . Speciﬁc name and keywords are then given to each category by annotating sticky notes . Sometimes 58 C . Bouchard and J . - F . Omhover Fig . 3 Category Pop they come directly from a magazine . The passage from words to images and vice - versa is iterative and very dynamic . The proposed names combine semantic adjectives , object attributes and sociological values . Only the strongest categories in terms of emotional impact , aesthetic and coherence are selected . The Conjoint Trends Analysis Method After studying designer’s cognitive activity in early design when they look for inspiration sources and other information , we model the information phase into a procedure namely the Conjoint Trends Analysis method ( CTA ) ( Bouchard et al . 1999 , 2008 ) . This method , based on the design rules and routines we identiﬁed , aims at anticipating trends in industrial design . The Conjoint Trends Analysis ( CTA ) enables to make explicit new intermediate representations before sketching activity : semantic mapping and mood - boards . It starts ﬁrstly by investigating the sectors of inspiration of the designers . These sectors are then used for analogical reasoning . Secondly , images and keywords are synthetized in mood - boards . The value of the CTA method , from theoretical point of view , is its support for formalizing coherent relations between high - level descriptors ( values , semantics ) and low - level attributes ( shape , color , texture ) , while increasing the number of processed data . These relations characterize designer’s expertise . Supporting Early Design Through Conjoint Trends Analysis Methods . . . 59 The Conjoint Trends Analysis follows three main phases . Phase 1 is about identifying the sectors of inﬂuence , Phase 2 is about trends identiﬁcation , Phase 3 is about trends integration . Phase 1 : Identiﬁcation of Trends Sectors of Inﬂuence The diffusion of trends corresponds to the transfer of formal , functional or technical attributes coming from other sectors of analogy . The identiﬁcation of the potential sectors of inﬂuence is a crucial step in the CTA method application . A sector of inﬂuence is any sector used as the source sector ( for instance animals ) which will enable to extract and transfer some formal or functional attributes in the sector of reference ( for instance car design ) . The ﬁrst phase of the CTA method is so to identify the sectors of inﬂuence from which the inspiration sources can be directly extracted . These sources are usually words , images or any other multi - sensory and experience stimuli . The example of biomorphism and of car design is a well known example . Biomorphism consists in taking shape expressions in the ﬁeld of animals in order to apply them in the design of new artifacts . A quick and easy way of doing the identiﬁcation of the sectors of inﬂuence is the elaboration of a semantic mapping . The semantic mapping is a 2D visual representation built with many product images coming from the sectors of inﬂuence by the design team , including design - ers , engineers , ergonomists , and people from marketing . This kind of representation allows in a second time to highlight the sectors of inﬂuence . The sectors of inﬂuence are those used by designers to apply analogical reasoning and ﬁnally stimulate the generation of new concepts . The interpretation of the semantic mapping by designers leads to the visual identiﬁcation of sectors of inﬂuence which may have inﬂuenced the design of the various products displayed . Visualizing the semantic mapping also offers a clear and quite exhaustive view of the product competitors . This way , it supports decision making for positioning and leading future products ( Figs . 4 and 5 ) .

Bouchard and J . - F . Omhover Fig . 5 Semantic mapping , Men Shoes , Axes : traditional - avant garde & comfortable - chic Building the semantic mapping goes through the following steps : ( a ) Gathering product images in the sector of reference ( about several hundreds ) . ( b ) Semantic characterization of the products gathered by annotation . ( c ) Positioning of the images according to the semantic axes processed intuitively ( semantic axes considered as the strongest or the most discriminating ) . ( d ) Extraction of the sectors of inﬂuence by observation : for instance « this product has been designed by taking inspiration in an insect » . This step needs the presence and skill of a designer at least . ( e ) Summarizing the sectors in a table or in a list . Phase 2 : Moodboards Elaboration The goal in this second phase is to realize digital or physical moodboards . It ﬁrstly consists in making explicit the atmosphere or ambiences which integrate both consumer values and the transverse attributes such as : shape , color , usability principles , texture , semantics , values , and to extract the related pallets of attributes ( see Fig . 6 ) . This phase is based on an iterative search of words and images realized from the content analysis of images and related texts , and then linking the values , Supporting Early Design Through Conjoint Trends Analysis Methods . . . 61 Fig . 6 Explicit representations elaborated through CTA approach : Semantic mapping ( on the left ) and mood - boards ( on the right ) functions and attributes between the various collected sources . Gathering images is realized in the sectors of inﬂuence identiﬁed during the ﬁrst phase . It is guided both by data related to the design brief ( style , semantics , values ) and the words and images included in the various inspiration sources ( mainly from magazines or internet ) . All this information is then categorized in a coherent way in homogeneous ambiences , homogeneous in terms of style , values and semantics . Moodboards , representing these atmospheres , correspond to the compositions of images and keywords expressed by the design team . Again , the skills of the designer are crucial in this phase for guarantying this coherency and the use of harmonies rules when establishing the speciﬁc atmosphere of the moodboard . The information so categorized from the various sectors of inﬂuence reveals the trends which are transverse by nature . Building the moodboards goes through the following steps : 1 . Gathering images and keywords in the various sectors of inﬂuence identiﬁed in the ﬁrst phase , in complement to the lists of speciﬁcations included in the brief ( style , semantics , values , targeted population ) . 2 . Categorization of the images by keywords ( semantic descriptors and values of the targeted population ) and formal attributes ( colors , shapes , textures ) . 3 . Composition of the atmosphere or ambience with coherent and homogeneous sets of keywords and images . The coherence obeys to harmony rules , for the color ( rules of contrasts or complementary colors , : : : ) , as well as the shape , the texture , the semantics and the usability . 4 . Description of atmosphere . This step consists in a textual description of the atmosphere by using and deﬁning keywords that characterize it ( rules of relations between abstract values , semantics and formal attributes ) . 62 C . Bouchard and J . - F . Omhover 5 . Elaboration of pallets of shape , color , usage , texture . From the atmospheres constituted in step 3 , the major harmonies are extracted and shown in the pallets , with strong and signiﬁcant elements for the related atmosphere , such as relevant colors and textures , and eventually usage and interaction principles . 6 . Description of the pallets . The pallets are described in text . Phase 3 : Trends Integration in the New Design Process of New Product Design The third phase of integration into the design process consists in the transfer in the new design solutions of some harmonies selected in the pallets of shape , color , usage , textures . This integration takes place during the concept’s generation . It relates ﬁrstly to the shape , then to usage principles , through concepts sketches , and ﬁnally to colors and textures . The elements extracted from the pallets are integrated into the concepts , by following harmony rules . These harmonies are compositions in which combinations of shapes , colors and textures offer an aesthetic set , functional , coherent and balanced . The integration of shape inspiration may be done by shape interpolation or morphing . For instance , this is the case when car designers provide an aggressive character to a sport vehicle , by designing the silhouette of the front face in a way that it will remind directly of shape elements transferred from other sectors such as that of animals . Another example is aerodynamic shape given to some pens . Shape elements integration is led at two different levels : 2D sketches and 3D digital or physical models . The design team has to be aware about the possible loose of information between these two steps ( from the sketch to the volume ) . Indeed , during the progressive concepts materialization ( prototype , pre - serie , serie ) , the choices realized may change the nature of the positioning . Regarding color , harmonies of complementary colors , contrasts or opposition are selected in the pallets and then extracted and re - interpreted in the design context . The application of colors and textures can be simulated on quick sketches or 3D digital models . The integration of usage principles , as soon as it refers to digital interfaces , is more complex and needs to be worked out in global scenarios . Moodboards are often used as inspiration sources during the ﬁrst sessions of brainstorming during concepts generation . The selection of the trends to be developed for the concepts generation has to be done according to the marketing strategy of the company . This strategy may be a leading strategy , in this case the trends to develop should be cutting - edge , or it may be a follower strategy , which will orient towards more mature trends . The integration of the trends in the design process goes through the following steps : 1 . Selection of harmonies in the pallets realized during the preceding step ( shape , color , texture , usage ) . 2 . Application of the integration of shape and usage , interpolations , morphings , during concepts generation , etc . Supporting Early Design Through Conjoint Trends Analysis Methods . . . 63 3 .

Following of design and development phases in order to be in adequacy with original design orientations and in coherency according to the selected trends . Limits of CTA Method From 1998 until today , The Conjoint Trends Analysis ( CTA ) has been disseminated in industry in marketing and design and innovation departments . It was used in different sectors of application and proved to be useful and relevant for professional designers . Applying this method has enabled to reﬁne the theoretical model in the information phase and to highlight some shortcomings of this method . These shortcomings relate to the difﬁculty and effort of seeking , gathering and processing information . For this reason , a tool that partially digitizes the CTA method has been developed based on information available on the web . This tool called TRENDS is described in the remainder of this chapter . The TRENDS Tool : Digitizing the Informational Phase of Early Design Towards a Computer Support Tool for the Information Phase Designers tend to build digital databases which are more and more important in their activity ( Restrepo et al . 2004 ; Büscher et al . 2000 ; Restrepo and Christiaans 2005 ; Stappers and Sanders 2005 ) , but which do not offer relevant search engines adapted to their needs . Indeed , these information systems are rather based on concepts - based search using the objective objects’ character , more than semantic and emotions based search . Resaerchers have argued that future information systems used for creative purpose should enable navigating into the representations of knowledge , visualizing , for sharing and developing new representations in a playful way ( Schneiderman 2000 ; Bonnardel 2000 ; Keller 2005 ; Nakakoji 2006 ) . Besides , image search should involve a certain amount of serendipity , with the possibility to use abstract values as well as semantic descriptors . Considering all of these objectives , we set out to design a new system that would be in synergy with the cognitive processes of the designers . To this end , it was ﬁrst necessary to describe their expertise in a way that could be implemented by algorithms , and following the CTA structure . This tool should provide in real time quite exhaustive results by enlarging the corpus of available images in the various sectors of inﬂuence . It would support the creative phase of concepts generation by providing some inspirational material . Data gathering by designers was achieved through ﬁctive design scenarios and through the data extraction from previous projects where CTA was applied . 64 C . Bouchard and J . - F .

Table 1 shows the sectors of inﬂuence identiﬁed in 1997 and 2006 through a series of interviews held with car designers . It is interesting to observe that these sectors were more or less the same in both occasions . This means they are relatively stable for designers , suggesting that accessing related information should be supported digitally ( Bouchard et al . 2008 , 2009 , [ TRENDS D2 . 3 ] ) . The second result was a table of sets of data which show the correspondence between the different categories of information processed by the designers and classiﬁed by levels of abstraction ( see Table 2 ) . This structure has been used in order to establish design ontology ( Fig . 7 ) .

Bouchard and J . - F . Omhover Fig . 8 Prototype TRENDS . We implemented the following functions : random image search , semantic text search , content - based search ( by the similarity to an image ) , or mixed text / image search to link different levels of abstraction of information and to propose new types of processing for this information . The digital transition enables automatic image grouping by color harmonies and the automatic generation of pallets of color harmonies with clustering algorithms using these harmony rules as ﬁlters . Applying Principal Components Analysis on the adjectives which are associated to the images on the websites allows a semi - automatic semantic mapping . A statistic function examines in real time the level of representativeness of a word or an image in the inspiration sectors by using similarity rules or the presence of words . The content and structure of design information processed by TRENDS system is represented Table 2 . This information has been grouped by decreasing abstraction levels , going from low - level ( shape , color , texture ) to high - level ( semantics , values ) . Harmony rules may apply to one of these levels ( color harmonies ) or to the link between different levels ( semantic search ) . The prototype gives access to these functions via a graphical user interface . It relies on a search engine connected to a database of approximately 2 . 000 . 000 images .

Conclusion Research in design science is oriented towards industry needs : increasing the variety of design solutions in less time and better answering to user needs . We modeled the information process in early design , where much is still implicit even in industry . We divided each micro - cycle in four phases : information , generation , and evaluation oriented towards decision and materialization . The information phase has been modeled in the framework of the elaboration and experimentation of the Conjoint Trends Analysis method . The progressive formalization of these different phases helped identify where computers may bring value by supporting or even automating routine tasks . However it is essential to preserve the hedonic aspects of a design activity , by providing user friendly tools , playful and attractive for the designers in some tedious or limited phases . Our research was then oriented towards digitizing the informational phase of early design with the TRENDS software . This phase is by nature ill - deﬁned , imprecise , subjective and affective , but also individual and collective , and multi - disciplinary . This makes difﬁcult the formalization and the computation of routines and rules in this phase . We have addressed this challenge in terms of a semi - automatic tool for supporting the information phase . Perspectives The formalization and the digitization of informational processes for elaborating models and contributing to the development of computational systems for the information phase is currently being enlarged to the other phases of generation and evaluation . Initial models are progressively enriched with the integration of methods and tools coming from Kansei engineering , artiﬁcial intelligence , cognitive ergonomics and applied creativity to concurrent engineering . Kansei engineering models helps us to reﬂect on cognitive and affective relations as well as computational rules that may exist between evaluation and generation phases . The scientiﬁc goal of is to deﬁne new computer aided design systems for enriching and improving the design process . These models need to adapt more and more to concurrent engineering , also the reduction of times and costs , and more variability in design response . Modeling the cognitive and affective processes in early design remains a ﬁeld of interest , as well as the elaboration of design - oriented formalisms and the identiﬁcation and selection of algorithms to enable digitization of early 68 C . Bouchard and J . - F . Omhover design processes . Particularly , the formalization of the relation between the deep needs of users and designers , while scanning the new technologies taking shape , will enable to develop new tools that can improve the interaction from the point of view of Kansei . This calls for keeping an eye on changes in design science , cognitive psychology and artiﬁcial intelligence . Recent evaluation methods , based on knowledge and tracks analysis , and also , new algorithms may be implemented to enrich design activity . The creation of new models will be based not only on the integration of implicit data , but also on the association of models in meta - models . Design information will also be enriched thanks to the advances in new disciplines such as sociology and neurosciences . The increasingly reﬁned analysis of the interaction and of the physiological response in front of multi - sensory and multimodal stimuli will still enable us to model what is currently left implicit . Finally , a reﬂection should be conducted about the progressive translation towards a meta - model taking into account every phase of information , generation , evaluation and materialization in a whole unique digital device , through augmented and immersive technologies .
