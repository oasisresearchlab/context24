We suggest a 3D generalization of a known 2D minimal phase ﬁeld model suggested in [ 1 ] for the de - scription of keratocyte motility . Our model consists of two coupled evolution equations for the order parameter and a three - dimensional vector ﬁeld describing the actin network polarization ( orienta - tion ) . We derive a closed evolutionary integro - diﬀerential equation governing the interface dynamics of a 3D cell . The equation includes the normal velocity of the membrane , its curvature , cell volume relaxation , and a parameter that is determined by the non - equilibrium eﬀects in the cytoskeleton . This equation can be considered as a 3D generalization of the 2D case that was derived in [ 2 ] . I . INTRODUCTION Over the past decade , increasing attention has been paid to the formulation of computational models that de - scribe the motility of 3D cells that crawl on ﬂat substrate [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] or invade 3D extracellular matrices ( ECM ) [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , which is the subject of this paper . This challenge has been mentioned about a decade ago in the review paper [ 8 ] as barely started ﬁeld . Since that time , the kerato - cyte motility , including the lamellipodium waves dynam - ics [ 9 ] , has been rather well explored using experimental and theoretical approaches . Actin polymerization is a basic mechanism in 2D cell motility [ 10 ] , [ 9 ] . When investigating the dynamics of 3D cell invasion in 3D ECM , one ﬁnds that there are several mechanisms or modes of migration that control 3D cell motility , and a cell may switch between them depending on cell intrinsic and extrinsic factors [ 11 ] . Among these mechanisms is the generation of protrusive force through hydrostatic pressure . This mechanism is called amoeboid and it does not need actin polymerization at the leading edge to generate protrusions . Another mechanism , which is the subject of this paper , is the Lamellipodium - based protrusion in 3D - ECMs which is called mesenchymal . This mechanism is based on actin polarization to form protrusion that enables cell migration in 3D ECMs , and it is analogous to the 2D actin - based cell motility . This migratory mode has been observed in some metastatic cancer cells while moving in complex 3D environments , see [ 11 ] and references therein . Recently a minimal computational phase ﬁeld model of 3D cell crawling on general substrate topography , not only on ﬂat surface , has been formulated [ 12 ] . In their model they assume that the actin exists only nearby the substrate surface and vanishes far away . Therefore this model is a nontrivial generalization of their 2D model [ 1 ] . In the present paper we suggest a 3D generalization of the original 2D model developed by Aranson and co - workers [ 1 ] , [ 13 ] ( see also [ 2 ] ) . It is assumed that the actin exists over all the interface of the 3D cell , hence that model can and be used as a model of 3D cell surrounded by 3D ECM . In the framework of our model , the cell geometry is de - scribed by a phase ﬁeld coupled with a three - dimensional vector ﬁeld of the actin network polarization . Thus , we suggest a model of actin - based 3D cell motility sur - rounded by 3D ECM . Relative to other phase ﬁeld ap - proaches , this model can be considered as a simple min - imal model describing the 3D cell motility [ 14 ] , [ 12 ] . In the present paper , we consider the case where the cell does not move as a whole but can change its shape . The structure of the paper is as follows : In Sec . II we present the minimal 3D phase ﬁeld model . In Sec . III we investigate the dynamics of the spherical shape interface . In Sec . IV we consider the general shape interface . We derive a closed evolutionary nonlocal equation that de - scribes the interface dynamics . Also , we investigate the stability of the spherical shape membrane . Finally , in Sec . V we present the conclusions . II . FORMULATION OF THE NONLOCAL PROBLEM We consider the following minimal phase - ﬁeld model of self - polarization and motility of spherical cell shape . This model is a 3D generalization of the 2D model developed in the context of keratocyte motility in [ 1 ] and [ 13 ] ( see also [ 2 ] ) . u t = D u ∇ 2 u − ( 1 − u ) ( δ − u ) u − α ∇ u · P , ( 1a ) δ = 1 2 + µ ˜ V − σ | P | 2 , ˜ V ( t ) = (cid:90) u d 3 r − V 0 ( 1b ) P t = D p ∇ 2 P − τ − 1 P − β ∇ u , ( 1c ) u ( r → ∞ ) = 0 , 0 < u < 1 , ( 1d ) P ( r → ∞ ) = 0 , ( 1e ) where u ( r , θ , ϕ , t ) is the order parameter that is close to 1 inside the cell and 0 outside . The interface is deﬁned by the relation u ( r = ρ ( θ , ϕ , t ) ) = 1 / 2 . The three - dimensional polarization vector ﬁeld P ( r , θ , ϕ , t ) = p ˆ r + q ˆ θ + w ˆ ϕ represents the actin orientations . It is as - sumed that P ( r = 0 ) is close to zero , and the cell does not move as a whole . See [ 2 ] for more details about the formulation of this simpliﬁed version of the full model that was developed in [ 1 ] . a r X i v : 2 1 06 . 01938v1 [ phy s i c s . b i o - ph ] 3 J un 2021 2 The model contains several constant parameters : D u is the stiﬀness of diﬀuse interface , D p is the diﬀusion coef - ﬁcient for P , α is the coeﬃcient characterizing advection of u by P , β determines the creation of P at the interface , τ − 1 is the inverse time of the degradation of P inside the cell , V 0 = 4 πρ 30 / 3 is the overall volume of the cell , µ is the stiﬀness of the volume constraint , and σ is the con - tractility of actin ﬁlament bundles . All the parameters listed above are positive . Notice that the model ( 1a ) - ( 1e ) is nonlocal due to the deﬁnition of δ . Because of the spherical symmetry of the problem , we employ the spherical coordinate system with the corre - sponding diﬀerential operators ( see Fig . 1 ) , ( r , θ , ϕ ) , 0 < r < ∞ , − π 2 < θ < π 2 , 0 < ϕ < 2 π , ( 2a ) x = r cos θ cos ϕ , y = r cos θ sin ϕ , z = r sin θ , ( 2b ) ∇ = ˆ r∂ r + ˆ θ∂ θ r + ˆ ϕ ∂ ϕ r cos θ , ( 2c ) ∇ 2 = ∂ 2 r + 2 ∂ r r + 1 r 2 (cid:16) ∂ 2 θ − tan θ∂ θ + ∂ 2 ϕ cos 2 θ (cid:17) , ( 2d ) ∇ 2 P = ˆ r ∇ 2 p + ˆ θ ∇ 2 q + ˆ ϕ ∇ 2 w + O (cid:18) 1 r 2 (cid:19) . ( 2e ) In the next sections we use arguments similar to those we used in the 2D case [ 2 ] . We begin our analysis with consideration of the spherical cell dynamics . III . ROTATIONALLY SYMMETRIC CASE Assume that our ﬁelds have a rotational symmetry , i . e . , u = u ( r , t ) , and P = p ( r , t ) ˆ r . In the present paper , the basic assumption is that the ratio (cid:15) of the thickness of the cell wall ( i . e . , the width of the transition zone , where u ( r , t ) is changed from nearly 1 to nearly 0 ) to the size of the cell is small , see Fig . 1 . In that case , the nonlocal term in ( 1b ) can be estimated as (cid:90) u d 3 r ≈ 4 π 3 ρ 3 ( t ) . The model ( 1a ) - ( 1e ) takes the form , u t = D u ( u rr + 2 r u r ) − ( 1 − u ) ( δ − u ) u − αu r · p , ( 3a ) δ ( r , t ) = 1 2 + 4 πµ 3 ( ρ 3 ( t ) − ρ 30 ) − σp 2 , ( 3b ) p t = D p (cid:18) p rr + 2 r p r − 2 r 2 p (cid:19) − τ − 1 p − βu r , ( 3c ) u ( r → ∞ ) = 0 , 0 < u < 1 , ( 3d ) p ( r → ∞ ) = 0 , | p | < 1 , ( 3e ) We introduce the scaling that describes slow dynamics of large enough cell radius , ˜ t = (cid:15) 2 t , ρ ( t ) = (cid:15) − 1 R ( t ) , ( 4 ) and deﬁne the transition zone variable , ζ = r − ρ ( t ) = O ( 1 ) . Also we deﬁne , R ( t ) = ˜ R ( ˜ t ) , u ( r , t ) = ˜ u ( ζ , ˜ t ) , p ( r , t ) = ˜ p ( ζ , ˜ t ) . Consequently the chain rule yields ∂ t = − (cid:15) ˜ R ˜ t ∂ ζ + (cid:15) 2 ∂ ˜ t , ∂ r = ∂ ζ . It holds that 1 r = (cid:15) R ( t ) − (cid:15) 2 ζ R 2 ( t ) + . . . The scaled equations ( 3a ) - ( 3e ) are , − (cid:15)R t u ζ = D u (cid:18) u ζζ + 2 (cid:15) R ( t ) u ζ (cid:19) − ( 1 − u ) ( δ − u ) u − αu ζ p + O ( (cid:15) 2 ) , ( 5a ) δ = 1 2 + 4 πµ 3 (cid:15) − 3 ( R 3 ( t ) − R 30 ) − σp 2 = 1 2 + δ 1 , ( 5b ) − (cid:15)R t p ζ = D P (cid:18) p ζζ + 2 (cid:15) R ( t ) p ζ (cid:19) − τ − 1 p − βu ζ + O ( (cid:15) 2 ) , ( 5c ) u ( ζ → −∞ ) = 1 , u ( ζ → ∞ ) = 0 , p ( ζ → ±∞ ) = 0 . ( 5d ) Because the motion of the front is inﬂuenced by its cur - vature 1 / R , the term R t u ζ in ( 5a ) should balance the curvature term 2 u ζ / R ( t ) in the same equation . That justiﬁes the choice of the time and radius scaling ( 4 ) . Assume that the parameters have the scaling α = (cid:15)A , 4 πµ 3 (cid:15) − 3 = (cid:15)M , σ = (cid:15)S , ( 6 ) and introduce the expansions u = u 0 + (cid:15)u 1 + . . . , p = p 0 + (cid:15)p 1 + . . . ( 7 ) Substituting ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) into ( 5 ) and collecting terms of the same order , we obtain at the leading order system ( 8 ) , D u u 0 ζζ = ( 1 − u 0 ) (cid:18) 1 2 − u 0 (cid:19) u 0 ( 8a ) D p p 0 ζζ − τ − 1 p 0 = βu 0 ζ ( 8b ) u 0 ( ζ → −∞ ) = 1 , u 0 ( ζ → ∞ ) = 0 , ( 8c ) p 0 ( ζ → ±∞ ) = 0 . ( 8d ) Following the Ginzburg - Landau theory and Fourier transform method , we ﬁnd the solutions of the system , u 0 ( ζ ) = 1 2 (cid:20) 1 − tanh (cid:18) ζ √ 8 D u (cid:19)(cid:21) , ( 9a ) p 0 ( ζ ) = β Φ ( τ , D u , D p , ζ ) , ( 9b ) Φ ( τ , D u , D p , ζ ) = ( 9c ) 1 8 (cid:114) τ 2 D u D p (cid:90) ∞ −∞ e − | r | / √ τD p cosh − 2 (cid:18) r − ζ √ 8 D u (cid:19) d r . 3 See Fig . 2 for the plot of the ﬁelds in ( 9 ) . The equation for u 1 at the order O ( (cid:15) ) is D u u 1 ζζ − (cid:18) 1 2 − 3 u 0 + 3 u 20 (cid:19) u 1 = ( 1 − u 0 ) u 0 (cid:15) − 1 δ 1 + Au 0 ζ p 0 − 2 D u R ( t ) u 0 ζ − R t u 0 ζ . The solvability condition of the latter equation yields the following closed equation for the interface dynamics R ( t ) , (cid:90) ∞ −∞ d ζu 0 ζ (cid:110) − R t u 0 ζ − 2 D u R ( t ) u 0 ζ + Au 0 ζ p 0 + u 0 ( 1 − u 0 ) (cid:2) M (cid:0) R 3 ( t ) − R 30 (cid:1) − Sp 20 (cid:3) (cid:111) = 0 ; ( 10 ) see [ 2 ] for more details . The expression ( 9a ) yields , (cid:90) ∞ −∞ d ζu 20 ζ = 1 6 √ 2 D u , (cid:90) ∞ −∞ d ζu 0 ζ u 0 ( 1 − u 0 ) = − 1 6 . ( 11 ) Hence equation ( 10 ) may be written in the form , 1 √ 2 D u (cid:18) R t + 2 D u R (cid:19) = M [ R 30 − R 3 ( t ) ] + Ω ( β ) ( 12 ) Ω ( β ) = 6 β ( A Ω 1 − βS Ω 2 ) , ( 13 ) where , Ω 1 ( τ , D u , D p ) = (cid:90) ∞ −∞ Φ ( ζ ) u 20 ζ d ζ , ( 14a ) Ω 2 ( τ , D u , D p ) = (cid:90) ∞ −∞ Φ 2 ( ζ ) ( 1 − u 0 ) u 0 u 0 ζ d ζ < 0 . ( 14b ) It is more convenient to consider the following presenta - tion of equation ( 12 ) of the front dynamics , aR t = f ( R ) R , ( 15a ) f ( R ) = − MR 4 + [ MR 30 + Ω ( β ) ] R − (cid:112) 2 D u , ( 15b ) where a = 1 / √ 2 D u . The expression in the right - hand side of ( 15a ) has the meaning of a ”force” acting on the cell surface . Therefore , equation ( 15a ) can be considered as a “force - velocity relation” of the motionless 3D cell immersed in 3D ECM ( see [ 10 ] ) . Recall that Ω 1 is positive and Ω 2 is negative , there - fore , Ω ( β ) is a monotonically growing function of β , see ( 13 ) , ( 14 ) . The nonlinearity of the dependence of Ω on β is caused by the nonlinear term − σp 2 in the expres - sion ( 5b ) for δ . The physical origin of that term is the contraction of actin ﬁlament bundles . In Fig . 3 we plot the function f ( R ) for two values of β ; the graph shows the existence of two stationary radii , stable , R + ( β ) and unstable , R − ( β ) , for β = 1 , while no stationary states for β = 0 . 4 . One can conclude that there exists a critical value β c such that there are no stationary solutions when β < β c . Below we ﬁnd that β c = 0 . 637 for the chosen set of parameters . The critical value β c has to satisfy three constraints : ( i ) MR 30 + Ω ( β c ) > 0 , which guarantees the existence of maximum of f ( R ) at a certain R = R ∗ , ( ii ) f ( R ∗ , β c ) = 0 , ( iii ) f (cid:48) R ( R ∗ , β c ) = 0 ( see Fig . 4 ( b ) ) . As a result we ﬁnd that β c is the positive solution of the quadratic equation MR 30 + Ω ( β c ) = 2 198 3 − 34 D 38 M 14 , ( 16 ) that can be found explicitly : β c = 1 2 S Ω 2 (cid:34) A Ω 1 − (cid:115) ( A Ω 1 ) 2 − S Ω 2 (cid:18) 2 278 3 − 74 D 38 M 14 − 2 3 MR 30 (cid:19)(cid:35) For β = β c , R − ( β c ) = R + ( β c ) = R ∗ = 2 18 3 − 14 D 18 M − 14 ; notice that R ∗ does not depend on R 0 ; for values of pa - rameters indicated in Fig . 2 , R ∗ = 1 . 041 . Because Ω ( β ) is a monotonically growing function of β , R − ( β ) de - creases with the growth of β , and therefore R − ( β ) < R ∗ for any β > β c . On the contrary , R + ( β ) increases with the growth of β . For values of parameters indicated in Fig . 2 and R 0 = 1 , we ﬁnd β c = 0 . 637 . If β < β c , then f ( R ) < 0 for any R , therefore the cell radius decreases with time and tends to zero during a ﬁ - nite time ( see Fig . 4 ( a ) ) . The temporal evolution of R ( t ) in the case of β > β c depends on the relation between the initial radius R 0 and R − ( β ) . If R 0 > R − ( β ) , then R ( t ) → R + ( β ) as t → ∞ ; if R 0 < R − ( β ) , then R ( t ) → 0 during a ﬁnite time . Therefore , if R 0 > R ∗ , R ( t ) tends to a ﬁnite value for any β > β c , because R − ( β ) < R ∗ < R 0 . However , if R 0 < R ∗ , the cell shrinks even at β > β c , if β is still less than a certain value ˜ β ( see Fig 4 ( c ) ) , which is determined by the relation R 0 = R − ( ˜ β ) ( see Fig . 4 ( d ) ) . Because f ( R 0 , ˜ β ) = 0 , the value of ˜ β can be found by solving the equation , Ω ( ˜ β ) = √ 2 D u R 0 . For β > ˜ β , R − ( β ) < R 0 , therefore the cell radius tends to a ﬁnite value ( see Fig . 4 ( e ) ) . In Fig . 5 we present the numerical solution of the ODE ( 15a ) for the values β = 1 . As we can see , the cell radius can increase monotonically until it reaches the steady state value . This is because in the framework of our model , the volume is not conserved and inﬂuences the dynamics through the parameter δ ( r , t ) , see equation ( 5b ) . The decrease of the cell radius ( in the language of the phase - ﬁeld model , the transition of the phase u = 1 into the phase u = 0 ) is caused by negative terms in the right - hand side of ( 1a ) , ( 3a ) , among them the term − δ ( 1 − u ) u , which is negative at large R , and by the diﬀusion term , which creates an eﬀective “surface tension” of the cell 4 surface . The positive term − αu r p hinders the decrease of the cell radius . If β is not suﬃciently large , the polar - ization is not strong enough to stop the collapse of the cell . In that case , the cell shrinks until it disappears ( see Fig . 3 , β = 0 . 4 . ) Note that at large β ( see Fig . 4 ( e ) ) we have Ω ( β ) (cid:29) 1 , and R − ( β ) (cid:28) 1 , therefore one can approximate the expression of f ( R ) in ( 12 ) as : R − ( β ) ≈ √ 2 D u Ω ( β ) . We can see that for suﬃciently large β , R − ( β ) can be arbitrary small . Therefore , for arbitrary small R 0 , there exists such ˜ β that the cell radius tends to a ﬁnite value , if β > ˜ β . For values of parameters indicated in Fig . 2 and R 0 = 0 . 5 , ˜ β = 0 . 96 . In Fig . 3 and 5 , we show the numerical plots for the parameters β = 1 , and R 0 = 0 . 5 . Let us emphasize that the described eﬀect is not phys - ical : for such values of parameters , the model does not reﬂect the true behavior of cells . IV . DYNAMICS OF GENERAL SHAPE INTERFACE We employ the scaling and deﬁnitions of the previous section . Now we have to consider the azimuthal depen - dence of variable . One can calculate , ∂ θ = − (cid:15) − 1 R θ ∂ ζ + ∂ θ , ∂ ϕ = − (cid:15) − 1 R ϕ ∂ ζ + ∂ ϕ , ∂ 2 θ = (cid:15) − 2 R 2 θ ∂ 2 ζ − (cid:15) − 1 ( R θθ ∂ ζ + 2 R θ ∂ 2 ζθ ) + ∂ 2 θ , ∂ 2 ϕ = (cid:15) − 2 R 2 ϕ ∂ 2 ζ − (cid:15) − 1 ( R ϕϕ ∂ ζ + 2 R ϕ ∂ 2 ζϕ ) + ∂ 2 ϕ , 1 r ∂ θ = − R θ R ∂ ζ + O ( (cid:15) ) , 1 r 2 ∂ θ = − (cid:15)R θ R 2 ∂ ζ + O ( (cid:15) 2 ) , 1 r ∂ ϕ = − R ϕ R ∂ ζ + O ( (cid:15) ) , 1 r 2 ∂ ϕ = − (cid:15)R ϕ R 2 ∂ ζ + O ( (cid:15) 2 ) , ∇ 2 u = (cid:32) 1 + R 2 θ R 2 + R 2 ϕ R 2 cos 2 θ (cid:33) u ζζ + (cid:15) (cid:34) (cid:18) 2 R + R θ R 2 tan θ − R θθ R 2 − R ϕϕ R 2 cos 2 θ (cid:19) u ζ − 2 R 2 (cid:18) R θ u ζθ + R ϕ cos 2 θu ζϕ (cid:19) − 2 ζ R 3 (cid:32) R 2 θ + R 2 ϕ cos 2 θ (cid:33) u ζζ (cid:35) + O ( (cid:15) 2 ) . The nonlocality in ( 1b ) is approximated as follows , (cid:90) u d 3 r ∼ (cid:15) − 3 3 (cid:90) 2 π 0 d ϕ (cid:90) π / 2 − π / 2 R 3 ( θ , ϕ , t ) cos θ d θ . We use expansions ( 7 ) , and deﬁne the auxiliary function Λ , Λ ( θ , ϕ , t ) = (cid:32) 1 + R 2 θ R 2 + R 2 ϕ R 2 cos 2 θ (cid:33) − 1 / 2 . At the leading order one can ﬁned , D u Λ − 2 u 0 ζζ = ( 1 − u 0 ) ( 1 2 − u 0 ) u 0 , D p Λ − 2 p 0 ζζ − τ − 1 p 0 = βu 0 ζ , D p Λ − 2 q 0 ζζ − τ − 1 q 0 = − β R θ R u 0 ζ , D p Λ − 2 w 0 ζζ − τ − 1 w 0 = − β R ϕ R cos θu 0 ζ , therefore similarly to the previous section one can calcu - late the solutions u 0 ( ζ ) = 1 2 (cid:20) 1 − tanh (cid:18) Λ ζ √ 8 D u (cid:19)(cid:21) , ( 17a ) p 0 ( ζ ) = β ΛΦ ( Λ ζ ) ( 17b ) q 0 ( ζ ) = − β Λ R θ R Φ ( Λ ζ ) ( 17c ) w 0 ( ζ ) = − β Λ R ϕ R cos θ Φ ( Λ ζ ) ( 17d ) The equation for u at the order O ( (cid:15) ) have the form , D u Λ − 2 u 1 ζζ − (cid:18) 1 2 − 3 u 0 + 3 u 20 (cid:19) u 1 = − R t u 0 ζ + − D u (cid:34) (cid:18) 2 R + R θ R 2 tan θ − R θθ R 2 − R ϕϕ R 2 cos 2 θ (cid:19) u 0 ζ − 2 R 2 (cid:18) R θ u 0 ζθ + R ϕ cos 2 θu 0 ζϕ (cid:19) − 2 ζ R 3 (cid:32) R 2 θ + R 2 ϕ cos 2 θ (cid:33) u 0 ζζ (cid:35) ( 18 ) + Au 0 ζ (cid:18) p 0 − R θ R q 0 − R ϕ R cos θw 0 (cid:19) + ( 1 − u 0 ) u 0 (cid:110) ˜ V ( t ) − S ( p 2 0 + q 2 0 + w 2 0 ) (cid:111) , where the volume variation has the form , ˜ V ( t ) = M (cid:34) 1 4 π (cid:90) 2 π 0 d ϕ (cid:90) π / 2 − π / 2 R 3 ( θ , ϕ , t ) cos θ d θ − R 30 (cid:35) . We apply the solvability condition , which is the orthogo - nality of the equation’s right - hand side to the solution of the homogenous equation u 0 ζ , and obtain a closed form of the interface dynamics , a Λ R t = − 2 aD u H − ˜ V + Ω , ( 19 ) where H = 1 2 ∇ · ˆ n = 1 2 ∇ · (cid:18) ∇ ( r − R ) | ∇ ( r − R ) | (cid:19) ( 20 ) 5 is the mean local curvature of the surface r = R ( θ , ϕ , t ) . For an explicit expression of the curvature see Appendix A . Note that in the spherically symmetric case Λ = 1 , H = 1 / R and ˜ V = M [ R 3 ( t ) − R 30 ] . Therefore , equation ( 12 ) is recovered from equation ( 19 ) . Notice that Ω in equation ( 19 ) , depends on all of the parameters that de - scribe the nonequilibrium molecular eﬀects of the subcell level , see ( 13 ) , and ( 14 ) . Equation ( 19 ) is a closed evo - lutionary equation for the 3D cell interface dynamics , which is an integro - diﬀerential equation , i . e . , it is nonlo - cal , unlike that obtained in the spherical case ( 15a ) . For the details of the application of the solvability condition in order to obtain equation ( 19 ) , we refer the reader to [ 2 ] and [ 15 ] , where we perform similar calculations . Notice that in ( 19 ) the expression Λ R t corresponds to the normal velocity v n of the interface , thus that equation is a generalization of the well - known curvature ﬂow . By a proper scaling transformation , t → a 2 t and R ( t ) → aR ( t ) , the equation of motion of the cell boundary can be brought to a canonical form , v n = − 2 D u H − ˜ V + Ω . In addition it suggests an answer for the unrevealed force – velocity relation for the actin network that was high - lighted in [ 10 ] in the context of shape dynamics of a 2D cell . A . Stability of the radial interface Let our base radial solution in ( 15a ) be perturbed R = ¯ R ( t ) + ˆ R ( θ , ϕ , t ) , ˆ R (cid:28) ¯ R . The linearization of ( 19 ) around that base solution yields , ˆ R t = D u ¯ R 2 ( t ) (cid:32) 2 ˆ R + ˆ R θθ − ˆ R θ tan θ + ˆ R ϕϕ cos 2 θ (cid:33) − 3 M ¯ R 2 4 πa (cid:90) 2 π 0 d ϕ (cid:90) π / 2 − π / 2 ˆ R cos θ d θ . ( 21 ) First , let us consider solutions satisfying the condition (cid:90) π / 2 − π / 2 ˆ R cos θ d θ = 0 . ( 22 ) Let us consider the normal mode ˆ R ( θ , φ , t ) = T ( t ) Θ ( θ ) e imϕ . For m (cid:54) = 0 the integral term in ( 21 ) van - ishes thus we do not have a contribution of the volume variation . For m = 0 it vanishes due to condition ( 22 ) . Applying the separation of variable method one obtain , ¯ R ( t ) D T (cid:48) T = Θ (cid:48)(cid:48) − tan θ Θ (cid:48) + (cid:16) 2 − m 2 cos 2 θ (cid:17) Θ Θ = − µ ⇒ Θ (cid:48)(cid:48) − tan θ Θ (cid:48) + (cid:18) 2 + µ − m 2 cos 2 θ (cid:19) Θ = 0 . The solution Θ is bounded if 2 + µ = n ( n + 1 ) ; in the latter case we obtain the spherical harmonics solution with the associated Legendre function , ˆ R = e imϕ P mn ( − sin θ ) T n ( t ) , n = 0 , 1 , 2 , . . . , m = 0 , 1 , . . . , n . All solutions with n (cid:54) = 0 satisfy condition ( 22 ) due to the orthogonality property of the spherical harmonics , therefore T n ( t ) satisfy , T (cid:48) n ( t ) = [ 2 − n ( n + 1 ) ] D u ¯ R 2 ( t ) T n . For n = 1 , which corresponds to the spatial translation of the sphere as a whole , we ﬁnd that T 1 ( t ) = const . Distur - bances with n ≥ 2 , which describe the shape distortions , decay with time . In the case n = m = 0 , which corresponds to a change of the sphere radius , the integral I = (cid:90) π / 2 − π / 2 Θ ( θ ) cos θ d θ (cid:54) = 0 , thus from equation ( 21 ) we obtain the equation , T (cid:48) Θ = D u ¯ R 2 ( t ) T [ Θ (cid:48)(cid:48) − Θ (cid:48) tan θ + 2Θ ] − 3 M ¯ R 2 ( t ) 2 a T (cid:90) π / 2 − π / 2 Θ ( θ ) cos θ d θ . Let us divide both sides of the equation by T Θ . We can see that both sides of the obtained equality are functions only of t : T (cid:48) T = 1 Θ (cid:104) D u ¯ R 2 ( t ) ( Θ (cid:48)(cid:48) − Θ (cid:48) tan Θ + 2Θ ) − 3 M ¯ R 2 ( t ) 2 a I (cid:105) ≡ λ ( t ) , hence D u ¯ R 2 ( t ) (cid:20) 1 cos θ d dθ (cid:18) cos θd Θ dθ (cid:19) + 2Θ (cid:21) − 3 M ¯ R 2 ( t ) 2 a I = λ ( t ) Θ . ( 23 ) Multiplying both sides of ( 23 ) by cos θ , integrating over θ from − π / 2 to π / 2 , and dividing by I (cid:54) = 0 , we ﬁnd that T (cid:48) ( t ) T ( t ) = λ ( t ) = 2 D u ¯ R 2 ( t ) − 3 M ¯ R 2 ( t ) a , therefore T (cid:48) 0 ( t ) = (cid:112) 2 D u d d R (cid:20) f ( R ) R (cid:21) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) R = ¯ R ( t ) T 0 = (cid:20) 2 D u ¯ R 2 ( t ) − 3 M ¯ R 2 ( t ) a (cid:21) T 0 . ( 24 ) The analysis of the sign of the expression in the right - hand side of ( 24 ) conﬁrms the result obtained in Section III : solution R = R − is unstable and solution R = R + is stable with respect to the radius change . T 0 can 6 grow , but when ¯ R ( t ) approaches its stationary values , the derivative d ( f ( R ) / R ) / dr at R = ¯ R ( t ) becomes neg - ative ( see Fig . 3 ) , hence the spherical cell is stable with respect to spherical disturbances . Note that these results are similar to the 2D case [ 2 ] , where we ﬁnd that the cir - cular cell shape is stable concerning a small disturbance . V . CONCLUSION We perform the analysis of a minimal phase ﬁeld model that is a 3D generalization of the 2D model developed and investigated numerically in [ 1 ] , [ 13 ] , and [ 14 ] ( a sim - ilar analysis of the latter model was done in [ 2 ] ) . In this model the order parameter u is coupled with 3D polar - ization ( orientation ) vector ﬁeld P of the actin network . The model is supposed to describe the 3D cell motility immersed in 3D ECM via actin based protrusion mecha - nism [ 11 ] . We considered the rotational symmetric case i . e . , spherical shape interface , where we obtained a closed or - dinary diﬀerential equation describing the evolution of the radius ( 15a ) . We found the minimum value β c for the actin creation that is compatible with the existence of a stationary cell solution ( 16 ) . We found that when β c < β , the circular cell can have some stationary radius , while in the case β ≤ β c the cell shrinks until it disappears , which is meaningless in the context of cell dynamics . Also , we considered the general shape 3D cell dynamics . We found the leading order solutions , ( 17a ) - ( 17c ) , and derived a closed integro - diﬀerential equation ( 19 ) gov - erning the 3D cell dynamics , which includes the normal velocity of the membrane , curvature , volume relaxation rate , and a parameter Ω determined by the molecular ef - fects of the subcell level . This result is similar to the 2D case [ 2 ] . We found an equation of motion of the cell interface that can be written in the canonical form , v n = − 2 D u H − ˜ V + Ω . The stability analysis shows that the non - spherical shape and the motion of the cell as a whole cannot appear due to the development of a linear instability of the spherical cell with the spherically symmetric polarization ﬁeld localized near the cell boundary . In the framework of the considered model , the transition to a non - spherical shape needs a ﬁnite - amplitude disturbance signiﬁcantly changing the polarization ﬁeld inside the cell . The analysis of that transition , which can be carried out only numerically , is beyond the scope of the present paper .
