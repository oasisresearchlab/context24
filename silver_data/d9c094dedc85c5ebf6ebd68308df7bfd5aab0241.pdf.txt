Introduction When cells are cultured on a ﬁ bronectin - coated porous membrane over NIH3T3 ﬁ broblast - conditioned medium containing chemo - attractants , they sprout and elongate cytoplasmic protrusions [ 1 , 2 ] . These actin - rich ventral protrusionsare called pseudopodia [ 3 ] . Pseudo - podia are leading edge of locomotive cells [ 4 ] and are involved in vari - ous types of cell motility , including the elongation of lateral or ventral protrusions and the axis cylinders of neural and dendritic cells , the transfer of mesenchymal cells in development and wound healing , and cancer cell invasion [ 3 , 5 , 6 ] . Filopodia , lamellipodia , and invadopodia are structurally similar to pseudopodia [ 3 , 5 , 6 ] . Pseudopo - dia and invadopodia are ﬁ lamentous , actin - rich protrusions that are involved in cancer invasion and metastasis , and are the key to under - standing the molecular mechanism underlying these processes [ 7 – 11 ] . Invadopodia are surrounded by radial actin ﬁ bers and integrin adhesion receptors , which are regulated by multiple signaling pathways that control protein phosphorylation , actin polymerization , and mem - brane traf ﬁ cking . Although the precise process remains unclear , invadopodia transform into larger membrane protrusions called pseu - dopodia [ 6 , 12 ] . Thetransitionfrominvadopodiatopseudopodia , includ - ing lamellipodia , is a key event that initiates cell body propulsion through the basement membrane and into the surrounding tissue and stromalcomponent . Invadopodiareportedlyhave stronger invasiveness properties than pseudopodia , such as the ability to degrade the sur - rounding extracellular matrix and basement membrane [ 13 ] . However , during this transition , it is dif ﬁ cult to distinguish pseudopodia from invadopodia . Thus , invadopodia may be an initiative form of pseudopo - dia in invasion and metastasis . Therefore , the identi ﬁ cation and analysis of pseudopodia - speci ﬁ c molecules will provide important insight into the mechanisms underlying cell motility , including cancer invasion . Cortactin , Arp2 / 3 , N - WASP , RAB1A , and PARVA have been reported to be pseudopodial molecules , and some of these have been functionally examined [ 1 , 14 , 15 ] . However , the precise molecular mechanism of cell motility has not been fully elucidated .

One application that is expected to provide promising pseudopodia - speci ﬁ c molecules is pseudopodial proteomics . 2 . Conventional pseudopodial proteomics methods 2 . 1 . Isolation of pseudopodia Here , we describe the processing of samples for large - scale proteo - mic analysis . Several of the steps can be modi ﬁ ed based on the type of analysis . Pseudopodia isolation is one of the most important steps in pseudopodial proteomics , becausethe quality of the sample determines the signi ﬁ cance of the results . The conventional manual scratch methods for pseudopodia isolation are described below ( Fig . 1 ) . Manual scratching , including the cotton swab method , is the most common technique used to isolate pseudopodia [ 2 , 16 – 19 ] . Pseudopodia , in either growth or retraction phase , are harvested by wiping off or scratching away the cell bodies on top of a microporous membrane using a cotton swab or glass coverslip . Alternatively , the cell bodies are harvested by wiping off the pseudopodia from the bottom side of the membrane . Cell bodies and pseudopodia are ﬁ xed with ice - cold methanol or cold phosphate buffered saline / CM ( 0 . 1 mM calcium chloride and 1 mM magnesium chloride ) to reduce protease and phosphatase activity . This step is necessary for large - scale puri ﬁ cation of pseudopodia and cell bodies ; however , the ﬁ xation step can be omitted for small - scale puri ﬁ cations , especially for applications requiring non - denaturing con - ditions , including immunoprecipitation and kinase activity assays . Then , the cell body and pseudopodial fractions are lysed in urea lysis buffer for pseudopodial proteomics . The lysis buffer can vary according to the application . Because the cell body fraction from one membrane may include a higher concentration of proteins than the membrane in the pseudopodial fraction , an approximately 5 - fold higher amount of pseudopodial membrane fraction than cell body fraction is analyzed from the same conditions to ensure that approximately equal amounts of protein are used . 2 . 2 . Proteomics of pseudopodia Pseudopodialproteomicscancomprehensivelyidentifythekeymol - ecules involved in cancer invasion and metastasis . Severalexperimental approaches can be used for pseudopodial proteomics , mainly gel - based and mass spectrometry - based methods . These approaches are not spe - ci ﬁ c for pseudopodial proteomics , as they are also used for proteomics of other targets . Gel - based proteomic approaches use electrophoresis methods , such as one - dimensional ( 1D ) or 2D - polyacrylamide gel elec - trophoresis ( PAGE ) and 2D - difference gel electrophoresis ( 2D - DIGE ) [ 2 , 20 – 22 ] . In these gel - based approaches , the protein spots are visualized with several staining methods , including Coomassie Brilliant Blue , sil - ver , and ﬂ uorescent staining . The stain used varies according to the tar - get . When the amount of the target protein is small , silver staining or ﬂ uorescent staining is adequate . Mass spectrometry - based approaches are performed on theprotein lysates of whole cells and unique fractions and protein spots selected after electrophoresis to analyze proteins that are expected to be involved in the targeted biological function . Gel - based approaches cannot be used to identify the target molecule ; thus , it is often used in combination with other approaches , such as gel - or liquid - chromatography – mass spectrometry / mass spectrometry ( LC – MS / MS ) - based methods . 2 . 3 . Problems with the conventional manual scratch methods Arguments have long been made about some problems in the con - ventional pseudopodial proteomics using the manual scratch methods . Although manually scratching away the cell body leaves the pseudopo - dia behind , the cell bodies are also not completely removed [ 2 , 17 , 18 , 23 , 24 ] . Therefore , the pseudopodial fractions are contaminated with some cell bodies . Although the number of cell bodies is small , the in ﬂ uence of this contamination is too signi ﬁ cant to precisely analyze pseudopodial proteins because the pseudopodial fractions have a fairly small amount of protein compared to thewhole cell body . Somepreviousstudies have reported a method for scratching the bottom wall of the porous mem - brane to collect the pseudopodial fraction and avoid cell body contami - nation [ 2 , 23 , 24 ] . These manualscratchmethodshave provenpractically useful , as evidenced by the extensive body of literature and numerous examples of clinically important pseudopodia proteins that have been identi ﬁ ed using the conventional scratch method . However , although scratchingthebottomwall eliminates cellbody contamination , proteins present in the proximal and central parts of the pseudopodia corpus are not harvested . In addition , as shown in Fig . 2 , pseudopodial microprocesses do not always reach the bottom of the porous mem - brane . Thus , the manual scratch methods are not ideal for the investiga - tion of pseudopodia . Moreover , it is unclear which fraction is collected using a commercial chemical reagent kit for pseudopodial fractionation [ 25 ] . Therefore , a method to completely separate all the pseudopodial microprocesses from the cell bodies is needed for pseudopodial proteomics . Fig . 1 .

Alternatively , by manually scratching the bottom sideof the membrane , pseudopodialedges are harvestedand proteins are extracted ( Manual scratch 2 ) . Extracted proteins are subjected to proteomic analyses . 2 T . Mimae , A . Ito / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta xxx ( 2014 ) xxx – xxx Please cite this article as : T . Mimae , A .

Isolation of pseudopodia While studying , including selective isolation of cancer cells in human lung cancer specimens using laser technique , the molecular mechanisms of lung cancer progression [ 26 ] , we happened upon a device that could be used for selectively isolating pseudopodia . The excimer laser is widely used in industrial applications , including micromachining in the high - performance Large Scale Integration of central processing units . Excimer laser irradiation is also known to generate a horizontal , ﬂ at ablation front in biomaterials [ 27 ] . In addition , after argon ﬂ uoride ( ArF ) excimer laser irradiation , little damage due to thermal or chemical reactions around the ablatedareaisdetected [ 28 ] . Infact , thistechniquehasbeenusedinclinical ophthalmology for reshaping the cornea in keratorefractive surgery ( laser - assisted in situ keratomileusis , LASIK ) [ 27 , 29 – 34 ] . We used an ArF excimer laser etching technique in our excimer laser - assisted method to solve the problem of cell body contamination in the above - mentioned pseudopodial isolation method ( Figs . 1 and 2A ) . 3 . 1 . 1 . Cell preparation No speci ﬁ c cell preparation is needed for cell etching by excimer laser irradiation . To form pseudopodia , the conventional culture insert bottomed with a 1 – 3 - μ m - pored polyethylene terephthalate ( PET ) membrane is placed into a well ﬁ lled with medium containing chemo - tactic factors [ 2 ] . Within a few hours to one day after seeding on the ﬁ bronectin - coated porous PET membrane , cancer cells with invasive potential elongate pseudopodial protrusions into the pores [ 1 ] . In our previous study , MDA - MB - 231 human breast cancer cells were plated on the above - mentioned culture system , and then the cells sprouted pseudopodial microprocesses into the pores ( Fig . 2B ) [ 1 ] . 3 . 1 . 2 . Excimer laser etching After one day of culture , the cells on the pored PET membrane with elongated pseudopodia were irradiated with an ArF excimer laser at 193 nm and 10 Hz ( EC - 5000 CXIII LASIK system ; Nidek , Gamagori , Japan ) to ablate cell bodies ( Fig . 2C ) [ 1 ] . Three settings on this system areimportantforbiochemicalablationinthispseudopodialexperiment . Fig . 2 . Pseudopodiaisolation . A . Extractionofproteinsfromthemembranesofpseudopodialmicroprocesses .

Pseudopodial microprocesses remained after ArF excimer laser ablation without morphological changes . 3 T . Mimae , A . Ito / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta xxx ( 2014 ) xxx – xxx Please cite this article as : T . Mimae , A . Ito , New challenges in pseudopodial proteomics by a laser - assisted cell etching technique , Biochim . Biophys . Acta ( 2014 ) , http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . bbapap . 2014 . 10 . 009 First , the basic settings of the excimer laser have to be changed . Because thislasersystemisusuallyusedforcornealsurgery , thesystemissetnot to make angles on the edges of the ablated areas . In other words , as it moves to the outside of an ablated area , the depth of the ablation be - comes shallower . Therefore , this setting was canceled , and the system was reset to make a wider , horizontal , ﬂ at ablation front that is greater than 100 mm 2 . Second , to ensure that the ventral portion of the cells is notleftbehind , thedepthbetweenthetopofthePETmembraneandthe bottom of ablation front was set to 1 – 2 μ m ( the depth of the PET mem - brane is 10 μ m ) , because if the ablation front was adjusted to the top of the PET membrane this could lead to cell body contamination . Third , to avoid degradation of cellular proteins , the scanning time used to re - move the cell bodies on the pored PET membrane was adjusted to less than 20 – 30 s . Of course , the cells should be immediately taken out of the incubator and applying cells on culture insert to excimer laser sys - tem to protect the pseudopodia . After changing these three settings , the ArF excimer laser can be used to ablate cells cultured on the PET membrane , and the cell bodies within a circled area that matched the ablated area are completely removed ( Fig . 2D ) . Formalin - ﬁ xed , hema - toxylin – eosin stained sections of the ablated cells showed that the pored PET membrane was horizontally shaved by approximately 2 μ m , and no remnant cell bodies were detected ( Fig . 2E and F ) . In addi - tion , pseudopodial protrusions without obvious morphological damage remained in the pores of the PET membrane [ 1 ] . Based on the above ﬁ ndings , the ArF excimer laser etchingtechnique was found to be a use - ful method that can be used to selectively collect pseudopodial protrusions . Although the collected pseudopodial microprocesses seemed to have nomorphologicaldamage , we were concerned about possiblepro - tein degradation because the length of pseudopodia was approximately 5 μ m , whichistooshort . However , basedonphotophysicalexamination , this possibility is low . The pore size ( 1 – 3 μ m ) is much larger than the wavelength of the ArF excimer laser ( 193 nm ) ; thus , the transparent PET membrane causes major light scattering . Therefore , ArF excimer laser is speculated not to invade into the pore and no thermal or chemical damages to the remnant pseudopodial microprocesses , such as protein degradation [ 35 ] . In fact , we found that the pseudopodial proteins collected after using the excimer laser were not degraded . The ablated PET membranes containing pseudopodia were punched out in a circle with a diameter that is smaller than that of the ablated area , and this circle sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen . The frozen membrane was crushed in protein lysis buffer and shaken with a Vortexer . Then , the pseudopodial proteins were eluted and puri ﬁ ed . These puri ﬁ ed proteins were subjected to immunoblotting analysis , and a type of integrin family molecule and matrix metalloproteinases was concentrated in the protein lysate generated from the ablated PET membrane compared to their levels in the whole cell protein lysate . Pseudopodial microprocesses that were left in the pore of the transparent PET membrane after ArF excimer laser ablation showed no signi ﬁ cant protein degradation , and the puri ﬁ ed proteins from the remnant pseudopodial protrusions could be used to comprehensively identify the molecules that are speci ﬁ cally localized in pseudopodial protrusions . 3 . 2 . Problems with the excimer laser - assisted method The novel excimer laser - assisted method appears to be ideal for pseudopodial proteomics , but has some weaknesses . For instance , the laser machine is prohibitively expensive for laboratories that do not re - quire extensive use of it , and technical assistance is needed at ﬁ rst use . In addition , cell ablation requires a relatively long time ( 20 s ) . The prosandconsoftheexcimerlaser - assistedandmanualscratchmethods are summarized in Table 1 . 3 . 3 . Pseudopodial proteomics Pseudopodial proteomic analyses should be quantitative because some proteins may be present in both cell bodies and pseudopodia , but expressed at different levels . Comparison of the protein expression pro ﬁ les in cell bodies and pseudopodia can identify pseudopodia - speci ﬁ c proteins . Mass spectrometry was used in the previous study to identify pseudopodial proteins ; however , the protein expression pat - terns in cell bodies and pseudopodia were not quantitatively evaluated [ 36 ] . Quantitative comparisons have been achieved by using isotope - labeling methods , for example , 16O / 18O labeling , to compare the pro - teins in cell bodies and pseudopodia [ 2 ] . The 16O / 18O labeling method enables precise comparison of thousands of peptides in small samples ; however , the linear dynamic range of detection in mass spectrometry is limitedto10 2 – 10 3 [ 37 ] . Becausethe dynamic range of proteinexpres - sion reaches 10 11 , this method is not optimal for pseudopodial proteo - mics . Alternative methods , including a gel - based approach coupled with ﬂ uorescent labeling and 2D - DIGE , have been used for pseudopodi - al proteomics [ 38 , 39 ] . However , as the sensitivity of ﬂ uorescence detec - tion in these studies was equivalent to that of silver staining , large amounts of protein , from50 to170 μ g [ 38 , 39 ] , were required for protein expression pro ﬁ ling . As the amount of pseudopodial proteins is quite limited , a more sensitive method is needed to avoid laborious pseudo - podial isolation and the possibility of protein degradation . In addition , a proteomic modality with a wide dynamic range and high sensitivity is required for pseudopodial protein pro ﬁ ling . In the excimer laser - assisted method , extracted , puri ﬁ ed pseudopo - dial proteins and whole cell proteins were applied to 2D - DIGE with Cy3 and Cy5 labeling as previously reported [ 1 , 20 , 40 – 44 ] . A mixture of both protein samples was used as an internal control . Puri ﬁ ed pseudopodia or whole cell protein sample was labeled with the Cy5 ﬂ uorescent dye , and the mixed control sample was labeled with Cy3 . Each labeled protein sample was electrophoretically separated using more than 30 cm of gel . The scanning system ( Typhoon trio® ; GE Healthcare Bio - sciences , NJ , USA ) can detect approximately 2500 protein spots [ 1 ] . The number of spots was lower than that in typical samples because the pseudopodial fraction contained a small number of proteins . Thus , it is meaningful that such minute protein samples , which are dif ﬁ cult to detect using Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining , could be analyzed by 2D - DIGE , an approach that has ultra - high sensitivity . The protein ex - pressionof the scanned spotsinthegelwascomprehensivelycompared betweenthewholecellandpseudopodialfractions , withhighreproduc - ibility . Certainly , the level detected in the 2D - DIGE represents the Table 1 Comparison between the excimer laser - assisted and manual scratch methods .

However , spots with higher levels in the pseudopodia compared to the control sample can be regarded as pseudopodia - enriched molecules . Then , the spots with 4 - fold higher or lower expression in the pseudopodia than in the whole cell fraction were picked and prepared for identi ﬁ cation by LC – MS / MS . A total of 211 spots were analyzed , and 46 candidate pro - teins were identi ﬁ ed [ 1 ] . 3 . 4 . Evaluation Next , to validate the pseudopodial localization of the candidate pseudopodial molecules identi ﬁ ed using 2D - DIGE and LC – MS / MS , im - munocytochemistry and confocal imaging ( for example , with a Nikon A1 and FM1000 confocal imaging system ) were used to analyze cells cultured on ﬁ bronectin - coated 3 - μ m pored membranes [ 1 ] . The cells were analyzed by phalloidin staining and immunocytochemistry with a ﬂ uorescent antibody against the targeted molecule . Phalloidin stains F - actin , as a positive control for pseudopodia , the main component of thecytoskeleton in pseudopodia . In our previous report , fourmolecules , RAB1A , HSP90B , TDRD7 , vimentin , and alpha - parvin were strongly de - tected in pseudopodia ( Fig . 3 ) [ 1 ] . Then , someof thepseudopodialmolecules , RAB1Aandalpha - parvin , were functionally analyzed for their involvement in cell motility pro - cesses , including pseudopodial formation [ 1 , 14 ] . The length and num - bers of pseudopodial microprocesses were measured using confocal imaging after phalloidin staining . There were more pseudopodia , and they were longer in cells that overexpressed the targeted molecules than in the control cells , whereas the pseudopodia were shorter and fewer in knockdown cells than in the control cells . The overexpressing and knockdown cells were also evaluated in a wound healing assay . The ability of the overexpressing and knockdown cells to heal a scratched wound space was stronger and weaker , respectively , than that of the naïve cells . These results indicated that the pseudopodial molecules identi ﬁ ed by the above - mentioned application have high po - tential to be involved in cell motility processes , including cancer cell invasion . 4 . Pseudopodial constituents The previous reports on pseudopodial proteomic analyses identi ﬁ ed many key molecules in cell motility . Despite the technical issues such as contamination that arise when using the conventional manual scratch method , many pseudopodial proteins have been successfully identi ﬁ ed leading to new insights in the ﬁ elds of cell migration and cancer inva - sion . Representative molecules are summarized in Table 2 [ 3 , 15 , 24 , 39 , 45 – 64 ] . Althoughnot listed inTable 2 , particular membrane proteinsin - cluding integrin family members are known to participate in the elon - gation of leading edges in pseudopodia , invadopodia , lamellipodia , and ﬁ lopodia . In our previous experiments , we obtained pseudopodial fractions by the laser - assisted method and applied 2D - DIGE , but failed to identify integrin members as pseudopodia - enriched molecules [ 1 , 20 ] . One explanation for this result is that proteins were extracted using a urea buffer , because urea produces cyanic acids that can cause Fig . 3 .

It is also possible that the identi ﬁ - able range of molecular weights was less than approximately 100 kDa simply owing to the limited size of electrophoresis gels , and that the range of isoelectric points was limited to pH 4 – 7 . Thus , membrane pro - teins that were not identi ﬁ ed are not speci ﬁ cally attributable to the excimer laser technique . Generally speaking , it is dif ﬁ cult to collect high - quality samples of the proximal portion of pseudopodia because of their proximity to the cell body . When the conventional topside scratch method is used , a considerable portion of the cell body should be pushed into the upper part of pores , where the pseudopodial root lo - cates . The bottom - wall scratch method is able to prevent the contami - nation of cell bodies , but unable to collect the proximal portion of pseudopodia because only the tip part of pseudopodia is present on the reverse side . On the other hand , nearly full - length components of pseudopodia can be selectively collected with the excimer laser - assisted method . It is to be noted that the components of pseudopodial fractions vary signi ﬁ cantly depending on the methods used ; the differ - ence in pseudopodial fraction components should be re ﬂ ected in the kinds of molecules identi ﬁ ed by proteomics . In cultured cells extending pseudopodia , focal adhesions are preferentially localized to the ventral cell membrane around pseudopodia and to the origin of the pseudopo - dia . Also in these regions , molecules involved in membrane traf ﬁ cking that carry various proteins out of the Golgi apparatus to elongate pseu - dopodia are abundant . Therefore , the excimer laser - assisted method may be more powerful for the identi ﬁ cation of molecules related to focal adhesion and membrane traf ﬁ cking . In fact , the membrane traf - ﬁ cking related molecule RAB1A [ 1 ] and the focal adhesion - related mol - ecule alpha - parvin [ 14 ] were newly identi ﬁ ed as pseudopodia - enriched molecules usingthelaser - assisted method . These twomolecules arede - scribed in the following sections . 4 . 1 . RAB1A RAB1A is a member of the Ras superfamily of GTP - binding proteins [ 65 ] . This molecule is expressed at a high level in cancer cells and is a potential biomarker for cancer survival [ 66 , 67 ] . Interestingly , the guanosine triphosphatase activity of RAB1A and the N - terminal phos - phorylation of vimentin ﬁ laments , which was also identi ﬁ ed as a pseu - dopodial protein , are involved in vesicle traf ﬁ cking of integrins to the plasma membrane [ 64 ] . In our previous study , RAB1A was identi ﬁ ed as a pseudopodial protein by using our new excimer laser - assisted method . Overexpression and knockdown experiments indicated that RAB1A plays an important role in forming and extending pseudopodial microprocesses in human breast cancer cells . MDA - MB - 231 human breast cancer cells show signi ﬁ cantly more pseudopodia elongation when RAB1A was overexpressed than naïve cells do , whereas less pseu - dopodia elongation is observed in knockdown cells . In addition , there are signi ﬁ cantly more pseudopodia per cell in RAB1A - overexpressed cells than in control naïve cells , and signi ﬁ cantly fewer pseudopodia in RAB1A - knockdown cells after two - day culture on a ﬁ bronectin - coated porous membrane bottomed with NIH3T3 - conditioned medium [ 1 ] . 4 . 2 . Alpha - parvin Alpha - parvin , also called actopaxin , is an adaptor protein consisting of an N - terminal polypeptide followed by 2 calponin homology domains arranged in tandem [ 68 , 69 ] . This domain structure enables α - parvin to recruit ﬁ lamentous actin ( F - actin ) and associate with stress ﬁ bers [ 68 , 70 ] . In addition , via the C - terminal calponin homology do - main , alpha - parvin binds a variety of partner molecules , including integrin - linked kinase and paxillin [ 68 , 71 ] . In cells spreading on extra - cellularmatrices , alpha - parvin associates withthe cytoplasmic domains of integrins , and thereby localizes to integrin - mediated cell - matrix ad - hesion sites or focal adhesions [ 68 , 72 , 73 ] . Based on these molecularfea - tures , alpha - parvin is thought to play prominent roles in integrin - mediated adhesion and actin - dependent processes , such as cell shape regulation and cell migration [ 74 , 75 ] . MDA - MB - 231 human breast cancer cells showed signi ﬁ cantly more potential for pseudopodia elongation , wound healing , and invasion in vitro when alpha - parvin was overexpressed compared to naïve cells after two - day culture on a ﬁ bronectin - coated porous membrane bottomed with NIH3T3 - conditioned medium . In addition , alpha - parvin positivity in invasive lobularcarcinoma of thebreast is signi ﬁ cantly associated with lymphat - ic invasion and lymph node metastasis . Alpha - parvin promotes migra - tion of breast cancer cells and is expressed exclusively by invasive lobular carcinoma , suggesting that it is an invasive lobular carcinoma - speci ﬁ c invasion molecule that may have clinical utility as a biomarker for aggressive subsets of breast cancer [ 14 ] . The above ﬁ ndings were found using not only cultured cells but also human surgical specimens ; Table 2 Pseudopodia - enriched molecules .

Conclusion and perspectives As described about RAB1A and alpha - parvin , the excimer laser - assisted method is infutureverylikelyto provide promisingbiomarkers with clinical signi ﬁ cance , although candidate molecules identi ﬁ ed by in vitro experiments often have little or no clinical meaning . In our experiment , the laser method was applied to live cells . This avoids pro - tein denaturation duetocell ﬁ xation . Becausethe laser method requires 20 – 30 s for cell ablation , particular changes in enzymatic activity and post - transcriptional modi ﬁ cations ( PTMs ) may occur . However , we have some data showing that enzymatic activity of live cells is not in ﬂ u - enced by our standard protocol including a 20 – 30 - s excimer laser abla - tion . A representative result obtained by zymography is shown for matrix metalloproteinase 2 ( MMP2 ) in Fig . 4 . Theoretically , our excimer laser - assisted method can be applied to ﬁ xed cells using procedures similar to those used for live cells , without any additional equipment . The comparison between live and ﬁ xed cells may provide interesting results . PTMs are crucial for molecules that regulate pseudopodial function , implying that key regulators may have speci ﬁ c levels of PTMs when present in pseudopodia . PTMs are often associated with changes in the molecular weights and isoelectric points for identical molecules , and thesedifferencesmayenablesuchkeyregulatorstobeseparatedaspro - tein spots unique to the pseudopodial fraction and lacking in the whole cell fraction in 2D - DIGE gels . In other words , such results may indicate the presence of pseudopodial molecules with pseudopodium - speci ﬁ c levels of protein modi ﬁ cation including phosphorylation and PTMs . In this case , af ﬁ nity methods including immunoprecipitation with anti - phosphotyrosineantibodiesandadsorptionofglycoproteinsusingalec - tin column can be applied . There are still several methodological problems that require solu - tions to facilitate pseudopodial proteomics . One concerns the usage of chemoattractants for pseudopodial extension . In our experiments using NIH3T3 - conditioned medium , some cell lines , such as MDA - MB - 231 and MCF - 7 breast cancer cells and B16 - F10 melanoma cells , had elongatedpseudopodia , butothers , suchasSBC - 3andSBC - 5lungcancer cells and MSTO - 211H mesothelioma cells , did not . This indicates that cell - speci ﬁ c chemoattractants should be used to promote pseudopodial formation . Furthermore , the culture conditions for pseudopodial formation should closely mimic the in vivo environments where live cells actually migrate using pseudopodia . Identi ﬁ cation of the key chemoattractant ( s ) in vivo is important . Another issue that requires at - tention is the methodological bias in identifying pseudopodial mole - cules depending on the protein extraction buffers used and the range of isoelectric points in electrophoresis . The selection of protein extrac - tion buffers and electrophoresis systems should consider the target molecules for individual studies . Contamination of cell bodies on the top and bottom sides of the membranes following laser ablation or scratching is another problem . In our experiments using MDA - MB - 231 human breast cancer cells , essentially no cell bodies were detected on either the top or the bottom side of 1 - μ m porous membranes after the excimer laser ablation . However , other kinds of cells may move through the ﬁ lter pores and reach the bottom depending on the pore diameter . This can cause contamination of cell bodies . Thus , it is necessary for re - searchers to con ﬁ rm the absence of cell bodies after laser treatment or wiring in each experimental system . Biomarkers or therapeutic targets of diseases related to cell motility disorders will likely be identi ﬁ ed through pseudopodial proteomics . As our study showed [ 1 , 14 ] , the major target diseases for pseudopodial proteomicshavelongbeenmalignantdiseases ; however ; otherdiseases could also be targets , for example , neuropathies such as Guillain – Barre syndrome , Fisher ' s syndrome , and chronic in ﬂ ammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy , because theexcimerlaser - assistedmethod islikelyap - plicable to proteomics of neurites . Another target is the wound healing process , because this process requires active migration of a variety of cells . After surgeries that include anastomosis or primary suturing of an organ , such as a bronchial stump , gastrointestinal anastomosis , and skin suture , the leaking of stumps or anastomosis and suture separation arethemostimportantpostoperativecomplications . However , noeffec - tive therapy for such postoperative events has been developed . Hence , novel ways to induce wound healing or prevent leakage and separation are greatly desired . Theexcimer laser - assisted methodcanbeapplied to any cell line that sprouts out pseudopodia into pores using a medium containing “ adequate ” chemoattractants . Consequently , this method is a promising approach for the identi ﬁ cation of pseudopodia - enriched molecules that play a critical role in cell motility , and will facilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the dynamics of cell movement and cancer invasion .
