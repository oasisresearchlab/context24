ICPESK 2015 : 5 th International Congress of Physical Education , Sports and Kinetotherapy Intellectual Abilities in Top Male Junior Tennis Players Radu Predoiu a * , Paula Ramsey b , Florian Arsenescu a * Corresponding author : Radu Predoiu , radu _ predoiu @ yahoo . com a National University of Physical Education and Sports , 140 Constantin Noica Street , Bucharest , Romania b Houstonian Tenis Club , Houston , Texas , USA Abstract Topographical memory , analogical reasoning capacity and attention represent intellectual abilities . Analogical transfer refers to those mental structures which allow us to solve problems based on similarity to already solved problems . Attention does not have an inherent reflective content , being present in all mental functions ( perception , representation , thinking etc . ) . Topographical memory represents a mental blueprint or a spatial map which enable us to appreciate from memory where an object / a location exists relative to those around it . The scope of our research was to investigate some intellectual dimensions and the sports performance of elite Romanian male tennis players . 12 male athletes have participated in our study aged between 15 and 17 years , ranked in top 15 players in Romania . To solve the research issues , we used : test – the computerized ANALOGIE , TAC and MT tests , within PSISELTEVA tests , developed by RQ Plus , SPSS 20 ( for data interpreting ) and observation . Using the Spearman correlation , there were highlighted important relations between the analogical reasoning coefficient , performance coefficient ( in the case of ANALOGIE test ) , learning capacity ( concentration of attention test - TAC ) and sports performance . The results state that improving learning ability ( the ability to quickly adapt attention to new visual conditions ) and the analogical transfer capacity can positively influence the evolution of tennis players on the court . © 2016 Published by Future Academy www .

Introduction Analogical transfer , attention and topographical memory represent cognitive ( intellectual ) abilities . Researchers have identified multiple mechanisms of transfer , including analogy . Analogical transfer involves three components : finding a prior exemplar , creating a mapping between it and the existing situation or problem , and then using that mapping to find a relevant solution in the current context ( Nokes , 2009 ) . Chen ( 2002 ) asserts that the transferred knowledge are ( in generally ) declarative representation , but procedural knowledge can be also transferred ( data which refer to execution rules , motor skills ) . An analogue source can be similar to another in a number of ways : they may have http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 15405 / epsbs . 2016 . 0 6 . 6 8 eISSN : 2357 - 1330 Selection and peer - review under responsibility of the Organizing Committee 491 similarities on the surface ( matching context ) , in their structure ( matching relations between objects ) , or both ( matching objects and relations ) . Attention ( as a mental function ) accompanies mental activity , being the one that leads to modelling the nervous tone . Attention represents a gateway to other cognitive ( intellectual ) processing , being a condition , also , for the developing of motor actions . Before problems solved , visual - spatial relationships perceived , the stimuli must be attended to . Thus , attention optimizes the knowledge of the subjective life or of a sector of the reality ( Horghidan , Mitrache , & Tüdös , 2001 : 149 ) . Through attention we achieve an important selection of the stimuli . Attention is the capacity to focus cognitive processing on the relevant target and avoid being distracted by insignificant stimuli ( Segal , & Hersen , 2010 : 81 ) . Specialized literature ( Spielberger , 2004 : 210 ) state that the capacity to pay attention to the task in sport is a vital determinant of success . It is known that athletes differ in terms of attention concentration capacity . Furley et al . ( 2013 ) showed that athlete’s capability to focus attention is based on the situational availability of self - control strength . Regarding the topographical memory it requires retaining a certain route for a period of time , supposing intellectual efficiency , orientation in space , risk taking etc . Topographical memory represents a mental blueprint or a spatial map which enable us to appreciate from memory where an object / a location exists relative to those around it ( Mendoza , & Foundas , 2008 : 356 ) . Topographical memory appears as spatial representations ( Zlate , 1999 : 219 ) . This capacity to manipulate and retain data regarding the visual and spatial environment is an essential intellectual process in human working memory , playing an important role in order to adapt to the surroundings ( Pearson , Ball , & Smith , 2014 ) . Different researchers ( Epuran , Holdevici , & Toni ț a , 2001 : 83 ) assert the importance of spatial memory in sport based on the understanding of the complex situation related to the athlete’s own action . The purpose of the study consists in investigating the analogical transfer capacity , topographical memory expressed through accuracy and speed in answers , attention concentration ( under slow and under fast speed conditions ) , and sports performance of elite Romanian junior tennis players . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Participants Twelve elite tennis players , aged between 15 and 17 years , with a competitive experience comprised between 6 and 9 years , participated in the study . We mention that 11 athletes are right - handed and only one athlete is left - handed . The male athletes are ranked in top 15 junior players in Romania . 2 . 2 . Devices and materials The devices and materials used in the study were : the computer ( only fulfilled the role of support in computerized testing ) – the participants did not provide any response to the tests using the keyboard or mouse ( the athletes viewed the standardized training on the computer monitor ) ; the computerized ANALOGIE , TAC and MT tests , within PSISELTEVA tests , developed by RQ Plus – these tests involve the use of levers , buttons console and pedals . Today , the use of computer technology ensures the accuracy of registrations . The movements associated with device manipulation ( buttons , levers , pedals ) are known as instrumental movements ( Ani ţ ei , 2007 : 123 ) . http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 15405 / epsbs . 2016 . 06 . 68 eISSN : 2357 - 1330 / Corresponding Author : Radu Predoiu Selection and peer - review under responsibility of the Organizing Committee of the conference 492 2 . 3 . Procedure The computerized ANALOGIE , TAC and MT tests were carried out by the athletes on the same day and in the same moment of the day ( in the afternoon ) . Also , the four different tests that assess cognitive abilities were applied in the same order . In the case of junior tennis players , the preferred hand was used , being generally faster . The participants were tested without previously practicing any physical exercises ( being in a rest state ) . The ANALOGIE test involves that , within a limited time ( there are few seconds for each item of the test ) , the participants push a lever button ( the left , centre or right button ) according to the response believed to be correct ( viewed in the left , centre or right side of the screen ) . An example of item is the following : “Ignorance is for Learning what Poverty is for : School – Wealth – Hope” . The coefficients provided by the battery software are : analogical reasoning coefficient ( it refers to the number of correctly issued responses and failed responses ) ; performance coefficient ( a qualitative measure statistically calculated by relating the correctly issued responses to the test time ) . The TAC test consists in giving a pre - established response for each signal - stimulus identified among insignificant stimuli . When designing the test , the creation of the following problematic situations was taken into consideration : the fast appearance of visual stimuli in a limited visual field , the random appearance ( time and space ) of significant visual stimuli , the appearance of a disturbing factor ( by alternating light ) , the combination of significant visual stimuli with irrelevant visual stimuli . The image that can be observed on the monitor contains a rectangle inside which there are seven letters ( the error warning window is placed in the lower right extremity ) . Response device - the lever . Inside the rectangle , rows of seven black letters are running ; the rows appear vertically from up to down , in a constant rhythm ; randomly , one of the rows may contain the letter S or Z – a phenomenon representing the appearance of signal - stimuli ; unpredictably , the brightness of the rectangle changes . The assessment takes place under slow speed conditions ( speed 1 ) and under fast speed conditions ( speed 2 ) . The task of the subject is to give a response when the signal - stimulus S or Z appears , by pressing the left button of the lever . The test lasts about 10 minutes . Among all coefficients provided by the battery software , we shall present the following parameters : correctly issued responses for speed 1 ( under slow speed conditions ) ; correctly issued responses for speed 2 ( under fast speed conditions ) ; learning capacity ( fast adaptation of attention to new visual conditions ) ; resistance to disruptive factors ( when facing a problem – unpredictable appearance of signal - stimuli , distraction , the subject gives correct responses ) . The MT test is designed as a labyrinth itinerary , which offers many possibilities to move across the space between two points placed in the extremities of the image . The test consists in giving , within a limited time , responses based on the memorized information . The image implies the existence of a labyrinth itinerary , a starting point and an arrival point . As response devices , one can notice a desk with three central buttons and a side button . The task of the athlete is to memorize the itinerary offered by the computer soft and to issue a response for retracing it forward - backwards , from memory . The responses are given by pushing the desk buttons according to the established program . The coefficients provided by the battery software are : Cmt ( topographical memory coefficient ) – it refers to the correctly issued responses and failed responses ; performance coefficient ( a qualitative measure eISSN : 2357 - 1330 Selection and peer - review under responsibility of the Organizing Committee 493 statistically calculated by relating Cmt to the test time ) ; test time ( seconds in which the participant has executed the test ) . The results registered by the tennis players at the ANALOGIE , TAC and MT tests were correlated to those obtained by the athletes in competitions , expressed through their ranking position in Romania . 3 . Results Preliminary data analysis ( stem and leaf and box - plot charts ) has emphasized that , in the case of results registered for ANALOGIE , TAC and MT tests , there were no outliers found . Through the Spearman correlation we checked if there were any relations between the analogical transfer capacity , concentration of attention , topographical memory and the sports performance . .

Correlation is significant at the . 05 level ( 2 - tailed ) . The analysis of the results indicated in Table 1 emphasizes that there is a negatively significant correlation ( - 0 . 588 , respectively - 0 , 634 ) between the analogical reasoning coefficient ( it refers to the correctly issued responses and failed responses ) , the performance coefficient ( a qualitative measure statistically calculated by relating the correctly issued responses to the test time ) and the performance obtained by the tennis players in competitions ( p < 0 . 05 ) ; As to the correlation , a proper indicator for the effect size index is the determination coefficient ( r 2 ) , whose value is 0 . 34 ( analogical reasoning coefficient ) , respectively 0 . 40 ( performance coefficient ) . We can say that 34 % , respectively 40 % of the variation of the two variables is common , while the remaining is due to other influences . This means that the relation between the analogical reasoning coefficient and the sports performance , respectively the relation between the performance coefficient and the sports performance , is moderate to strong . There is a negatively significant correlation ( - 0 . 641 ) between learning capacity ( fast adaptation of attention to new visual circumstances ) and the performance obtained by the tennis players in competitions ( p < 0 . 05 ) . http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 15405 / epsbs . 2016 . 06 . 68 eISSN : 2357 - 1330 / Corresponding Author : Radu Predoiu Selection and peer - review under responsibility of the Organizing Committee of the conference 494 The determination coefficient ( r 2 ) has the value 0 . 41 , meaning that the relation between the results for attention concentration in new perceptual conditions and the performance of the tennis players is moderate to strong . 4 . Discussions and conclusions This study demonstrates the existence of different significant statistical correlations between the results obtained by the tennis players for some intellectual abilities and the sports performance . There is a negatively significant correlation between learning capacity ( attention concentration test ) and the performance obtained by the tennis players in competitions . If the junior tennis players having a competitive experience between 6 and 9 years register a fast adaptation of attention to new visual circumstances , this aspect is related to a better performance of the athletes on the tennis court . Through an adequate mental preparation completed by modelling the competition in training , the tennis players will improve their ability to give more correct responses when confronted with new perceptual conditions . Also , there is a negatively significant correlation between the analogical reasoning coefficient , the performance coefficient ( analogical transfer test ) and the performance obtained by the athletes . If the tennis players give more correct and faster responses during tasks demanding analogical transfer capacity , this aspect is associated with a better performance of the athletes . This can be explained through the interaction between the transfer mechanisms . Thus , besides the analogical transfer , research studies discuss about knowledge compilation ( Anderson , 1982 ) and constraint violation ( Ohlsson , Ernst , & Rees , 1992 ; Ohlsson , 1996 ) . Knowledge compilation ( as a transfer mechanism ) will be triggered when the athlete has no accessible exemplar data or when the exemplar requires important adaptation in order to be applied . This mechanism translates prior declarative knowledge ( advices , tactics or instructions ) into a set of procedures that can be used to solve new situations or problems . For example , a tennis player , knowing about different tactics , can apply them to a wide variety of game situations . But the athletes must figure out if the implications of the tactics are suitable for a particular situation or problem encountered . When the declarative instructions or strategies are no longer applicable to the task , the constraint violation will be triggered - the athletes have no accessible exemplars and tactical knowledge does not apply . Constraint violation involves that the athletes use prior knowledge of the domain constraints to evaluate and correct their task performance . In our case , the tennis players , knowing the constraints in tennis ( avoid hitting the ball towards the opponent , hitting the ball with a particular effect influences its direction etc . ) , generate specific procedures - specific movements and executions in given situations . After a specific movement and execution , the tennis player will evaluate if a constraint has been violated ( for example , the ball has been sent towards the opponent , outside the court or in the net ) . The problematic procedure would be revised and a new procedure would be generated and evaluated . After multiple episodes , eventually the athlete will acquire specific procedures for what move to make in a specific situation ( when the ball comes too fast or very high over the net , having a specific effect etc . ) . We often use multiple transfer processes to solve a problem . What is different - the proportion of the transfer mechanisms which are triggered ( Nokes , 2009 ) . The development of analogical reasoning capacity ( a key - component of intelligence – Sternberg , 1977 ) influences the capacity to transfer data in eISSN : 2357 - 1330 Selection and peer - review under responsibility of the Organizing Committee 495 various situations that require procedural memory ( movements , executions ) . This may positively influence the evolution of the players on the tennis court ( during the competition ) , considering the existence of different situations which require fast and accurate movements and executions . We also mention Vosniadou and Ortony ( 1989 : 14 ) , who specify that analogy make us more flexible when we solve problems . Also , reasoning by similarity facilitates the learning of new rules and schemata . This paper can be considered a starting point for further deeper research – for a better understanding of the impact of knowledge transfer to sports performance . Our research was limited by the physical and mental state of the subjects during testing ( fatigue , affective - motivational factors ) , which may cause variations in the motor responses . Another limitation is constituted by the sample of athletes . The situation might be different with a sample made up , for example , only of female athletes . Conversation and observation support the value of our research . The research data will be used by the sport psychologist and coaches who will design stimulation programs for the characteristics : learning capacity ( in the case of attention concentration ) , analogical reasoning coefficient and performance coefficient ( the specialist will develop the ability of the athletes to give more correct and faster responses during tasks demanding analogical transfer ) . The ANALOGIE , TAC and MT tests may be used as complementary means of psychological preparation and can provide information with respect to the analogical transfer capacity , topographical memory and concentration of attention . Also , some of these cognitive abilities may represent an element of selection of the junior tennis players for the representative team . References Anderson , J . R . ( 1982 ) .
