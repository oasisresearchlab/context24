Long before , living organisms invented ingenious ways to cope with the requirement of space - saving designs down to the cellular level . Typical length scales in cells range from nanometres to micrometres so that the polymeric constituents of the cytoskeleton are often geometrically conﬁned . Hence , the mechanical response of polymers to external conﬁnement has potential implications both for technology and for our understanding of biological systems alike . Here we report a study of in vitro polymerized ﬁlamentous actin conﬁned to emulsion droplets . We correlate observations of the microstructure , local rheological properties and single - ﬁlament ﬂuctuations . Enforcing progressively narrower conﬁnement is found to induce a reduction of polymer ﬂuctuations , network sti ﬀ ening , structural heterogeneities and eventually cortex formation . We argue that the structural and mechanical e ﬀ ects can be consistently explained by a gradual suppression of single - polymer eigenmodes . Generally speaking , conﬁnement e ﬀ ects can be expected whenever an externally constrained dimension matches a characteristic internal length scale of the conﬁned system such as the end - to - end distance R or the radius of gyration or the persistence length l p of a single polymer , or the size of the correlation or entanglement unit in a semidilute polymer solution . What sort of mechanical response one should theoretically expect in either case is not a priori obvious and might well depend sensitively on the conﬁnement geometry . At the same time , it presents formidable experimental challenges to separately resolve the various scales in measurements and , therefore , despite considerable theoretical progress 2 , experimental studies with synthetic polymers could not yet establish a complete picture of conﬁnement e ﬀ ects on the nanoscale 3 , 4 . Biopolymer networks , on the other hand , are accessible to optical techniques and microrheometry . A versatile model system is provided by F - actin , a semiﬂexible biopolymer with typical contour lengths up to tens of micrometres and a persistence length of l p ≈ 17 μ m . In vivo , F - actin forms a geometrically conﬁned two - to - three - dimensional network , the cytoskeleton , which stabilizes the cell and is largely responsible for its viscoelastic behaviour . In vitro polymerized entangled and crosslinked actin networks have therefore been used extensively as model systems to attain a better understanding of the mechanical properties of cells ( see , for example , refs 5 , 6 and references therein ) . In bulk solutions and gels , the viscoelastic mechanical response of actin is determined by the thermally excited bending undulations of the ﬁlaments . Similar to rubber , the elastic response of the network is predominantly entropic and is expected to be very sensitive to anything that hinders the thermal ﬂuctuations of the polymers . Indeed , the spatial organization of actin networks in giant vesicles was reported to depend on the membrane composition , the vesicle radius and the ﬁlament length 7 – 9 . In small vesicles , ﬁlaments were observed to predominantly form a fuzzy cortex concentrated near the membrane , whereas a homogeneous actin network was found in larger vesicles 9 . However , it is di ﬃ cult to control such vesicles and , therefore , the consequences of purely geometrical conﬁnement on the mechanical properties of actin networks have not yet been addressed systematically . Here , we introduce an alternative method for encapsulating actin networks by phospholipid - stabilized emulsion droplets in which the ﬁlaments move freely at the wall , which is clearly demonstrating that the walls do not act as pinning sites , but rather as steric constraints ( see the Supplementary Information ) . We observed homogeneous bulk networks in large drops and a fuzzy cortex forming underneath the drop surface in small drops . In good agreement with earlier studies with vesicles , where the membranes contained cholesterol to avoid physisorption of actin at the walls 9 , we found that cortex formation only starts below a well - deﬁned droplet diameter D c ≈ 12 – 13 μ m . To quantify the heterogeneity of the networks , we measured the pore size distribution by a di ﬀ using bead technique ( see the Methods section ) . For example , for solutions of actin concentration c a = 1 . 2 mg ml − 1 the mean mesh size was estimated as ξ ≈ 0 . 23 μ m with a half width σ of 0 . 07 μ m for droplets with D ≈ 16 μ m and ξ ≈ 0 . 23 μ m , σ ≈ 0 . 04 μ m for D ≈ 148 μ m . Altogether , we found that for droplets 186 naturephysics VOL2 MARCH2006 www . nature . com / naturephysics Untitled - 4 1 2 / 18 / 06 , 11 : 35 : 40 AM Nature Publishing Group ©200 6 LETTERS 0 . 01 0 . 1 1 10 f ( Hz ) 0 . 01 0 . 1 1 10 G ′ , G ′′ ( P a ) I II a b Figure 1 Actin solutions encapsulated in sufﬁciently small emulsion droplets are locally more heterogeneous and more elastic than bulk solutions . a , Fluorescent micrographs of emulsion droplets containing rhodamine phalloidin - labelled actin ﬁlaments . In small droplets ( D ≤ 12 μ m ) , the actin is organized in a cortex close to the droplet surface ( I ) , whereas it is more homogeneously distributed in large droplets ( II ) . The scale bar is 10 μ m . b , The effective ( locally measured ) storage modulus G (cid:4) ( ω ) ( open symbols ) and the loss modulus G (cid:4)(cid:4) ( ω ) ( ﬁlled symbols ) of conﬁned actin networks in emulsion droplets of diameters D = 20 μ m ( open circles and ﬁlled circles ) and D = 133 μ m ( open triangles and ﬁlled triangles ) , respectively . Data are shown for an actin concentration of 1 . 2 mg ml − 1 and a ratio of actin to gelsolin r A : G of 7 , 770 : 1 . of diameters less than D ≈ 30 μ m but larger than D c the network became more heterogeneous . To test whether these heterogeneities also increased the networks sti ﬀ ness we used active microrheology to determine the local moduli . For ease of comparison with macrorheometric data , it is customary to represent the locally measured susceptibilities in the form of frequency - dependent local storage and loss moduli , G (cid:4) , G (cid:4)(cid:4) . Typical examples for the frequency - dependent ‘local moduli’ thus obtained by the active technique for the conﬁned actin networks are shown in Fig . 1b . In the large droplet ( D = 133 μ m ) , where no conﬁnement e ﬀ ects are expected ( contour length L ≈ 21 μ m , l p ≈ 17 μ m ) , the local moduli are similar to those observed for bulk actin solutions 10 in both magnitude and dependence on actin concentration . In smaller droplets ( D = 20 μ m ) , both G (cid:4) and G (cid:4)(cid:4) are observed to increase signiﬁcantly . The frequency dependence of the moduli , however , remains essentially unchanged : the frequency where G (cid:4) and G (cid:4)(cid:4) intersect , the slope of the plateau in G (cid:4) and the scaling of G (cid:4)(cid:4) at the highest measured frequencies are found to be comparable for all droplet diameters . We tested with passive microrheology using latex beads in the diameter range of 500 nm to 4 μ m that the onset of the network hardening was independent of the bead size ( data not shown ) . Even in small droplets , the network organization was not observably a ﬀ ected by the presence of probe particles . The main e ﬀ ect of conﬁnement on the microrheological properties , therefore , seems to be a shift in the overall energy scale , given by the plateau elastic modulus G 0 . This intriguing observation of an essentially invariant functional form of the moduli under conﬁnement could possibly indicate that our highest frequencies are still far below the so - called high - frequency regime , which is predicted to arise from independent single - polymer contributions 11 , 12 . Alternatively , it may be interpreted as evidence that the e ﬀ ects of conﬁnement on the single - polymer response ( at high frequencies ) and on the local collective rheological properties ( at low frequencies ) are intimately linked . Figure 2a shows G 0 ≡ G (cid:4) ( 0 . 01 Hz ) as a function of the droplet diameter D for actin concentrations of 0 . 6 and 1 . 2 mg ml − 1 . For both concentrations , G 0 was found to be independent of the droplet diameter for D > 30 μ m , whereas on further conﬁnement G 0 was observed to increase signiﬁcantly . In contrast , for solutions consisting of ﬁlaments with a mean length of 5 μ m , G 0 was found to be independent of D down to the smallest droplet diameters that could be tested ( not shown ) . This strongly suggests that the conﬁnement e ﬀ ects set in when the characteristic conﬁning linear dimension approaches the end - to - end distance R , which seems to be in accord with observations of a similar increase in the viscoelastic moduli for ﬂexible polymers 3 , 4 , although the interpretation remained somewhat inconclusive in the latter case . We propose to apply concepts originally developed for the bulk plateau shear modulus of semiﬂexible polymer solutions to rationalize the increase in elasticity with increasing geometrical conﬁnement of the actin solutions ( see ref . 13 for an overview ) . The microscopic origin of the rubber plateau is the strong conﬁnement of entangled polymers to tube - like regions on intermediate timescales ; from seconds up to many minutes for F - actin . In contrast to crosslinked networks , where the a ﬃ ne stretching of single ﬁlaments can well account for the observed viscoelastic properties 14 , 15 , the response of entangled solutions without crosslinks is thought to be dominated by a lateral conﬁnement of the thermal bending undulations 10 , 16 , 17 . The corresponding prediction for the bulk plateau modulus is G 0 ≈ k B T / V e , where k B is Boltzmann’s constant , T is temperature and V e is the average volume per binary ﬁlament collision that decreases with monomer concentration c a as V e ∼ c − 7 / 5 a in bulk solutions , which explains very well the macroscopically measured scaling G 0 ∼ c 7 / 5 a of the plateau modulus with actin concentration 10 . To understand how the elasticity increases on conﬁnement , we have thus to understand how this ‘entanglement volume’ V e decreases in response to the conﬁnement constraints . To this end , we measured the conformations of ﬂuorescently labelled actin ﬁlaments , which were polymerized close to the critical polymerization concentration ( c A = 0 . 24 μ M ) . This resulted in emulsion droplets containing only a few actin ﬁlaments . When the short - time ﬂuctuations in a plane perpendicular to the ( average ) polymer axis were followed , the width of the ﬂuctuations A was observed to decrease with decreasing droplet diameter D ( Fig . 2a inset ) . For droplet diameters larger than 30 μ m , A ( D ) levels o ﬀ , which coincides well with the constant bulk moduli measured for D > 30 μ m . Assuming a persistence length l p ≈ 17 μ m , our experimental data for A can be ﬁtted very well with a power law A = 0 . 05 D 3 / 2 l − 1 / 2 p for D < 30 μ m ( Fig . 2a inset ) , where the constant factor l − 1 / 2 p introduced for dimensional reasons anticipates the theoretical prediction .

Inset : The width A of the ﬂuctuations of a conﬁned single ﬁlament in a dilute network as a function of the droplet diameter ( ﬁlled circles ) can be ﬁtted with equation ( 1 ) with a slightly reduced numerical prefactor as described in the text ( line ) . b , Using equation ( 2 ) , one obtains the plateau shear modulus G 0 either directly from the data for A obtained in the inset of a ( ﬁlled circles ) or from the ﬁt to these data ( line ) in rather good agreement with the microrheological data ( open circles , c a = 1 . 2 mg ml − 1 , a r A : G = 7 , 770 : 1 ) . The data points ( ﬁlled circles ) were obtained by binning ( 6 μ m ) the droplet size , the error bars give the standard deviations in the amplitude and droplet size . Inset : snapshots from a Monte Carlo simulation of a weakly bending free single ﬁlament with successively more of the longest modes suppressed ( from back to front ) , which illustrates the mechanism underlying the theoretical prediction equation ( 1 ) proposed to be responsible for the developing heterogeneities and the accompanying increase of the network elasticity . the expression A ∝ D 2 proposed in earlier studies 9 , but is consistent with an e ﬀ ective suppression of increasingly higher single - polymer eigenmodes with progressive constriction , which yields ( see the Methods section ) : A ≈ 0 . 1 D 3 / 2 l − 1 / 2 p ( 1 ) in agreement with the predicted 18 ‘fuzzy diameter’ of a semiﬂexible polymer bent into a ring of diameter D . In view of the experimental di ﬃ culty in determining the width of the transverse ﬂuctuations accurately , and given the fact that sometimes more than one single ﬁlament was present in the measured drops , the quantitative agreement between the parameter - free equation ( 1 ) and the ﬁt in ( Fig . 2a inset ) is indeed very reasonable . In more - concentrated solutions , geometrical conﬁnement will act on the polymers in a similar way . However , as the polymers are entangled and therefore strongly interacting , the conﬁning constraints will result in a reorganization of the network structure , which is not a priori related to the single - polymer behaviour in a simple way . One expects that with decreasing droplet size , the actin ﬁlaments will initially rearrange to minimize their axial conﬁnement , which tends to crowd the centre of the drop . On further reduction of D , the ﬁlaments will start to buckle and to coil up on great circles , which will consequently deplete the centre of the drop and tend to crowd its periphery . Altogether , the network should in any case become increasingly heterogeneous on progressive conﬁnement . This expectation is conﬁrmed by the already mentioned increasing width of the measured mesh size distribution with decreasing D . The most spectacular indication for the developing heterogeneities is of course the relatively sudden change in the network structure from central crowding to the crowding of the periphery , that is , the cortex formation below for D ≈ D c . For the relatively sti ﬀ actin ﬁlaments ( L ≈ l p ) , it seems plausible that the latter is a consequence of strong ﬁlament buckling into semicircular conformations along great circles of the spherical drop , when the diameter D decreases to about D ≈ 2 L / π ≈ 13 μ m ≈ 2 l p / π in good agreement with the observed D c of 12 − 13 μ m . The corresponding mechanical buckling forces are already substantial for free polymers , namely at least about π 2 k B Tl p / L 2 ≈ 6 k B T / L per ﬁlament . To infer the expected increase in the plateau shear modulus corresponding to these structural rearrangements , we assume that the bulk relation ξ = d 5 / 6 l 1 / 6 p between the ‘tube diameter’ d , which we identify with the ﬂuctuation width A , and the local mesh size ξ remain valid . This results in the following expression for G 0 G 0 ∝ k B Tl − 2 / 3 p A − 7 / 3 ∝ k B Tl 1 / 2 p D − 7 / 2 . ( 2 ) For the last expression , we have made the further assumption that the concentration dependence of the entanglement e ﬀ ects and the external conﬁnement e ﬀ ects on the ﬂuctuation amplitude A factorize , so that for the dependence of A on D the functional relation established for conﬁned single polymers in equation ( 1 ) still holds for higher concentrations . Using the values 1 , 710 ( 1 . 2 mg ml − 1 actin ) and 630 ( 0 . 6 mg ml − 1 ) for the suppressed concentration - dependent prefactor in equation ( 2 ) , respectively , the data for A from Fig . 2a can be matched onto the measured G 0 ( Fig . 2b ) . Thus , equation ( 2 ) describes the increase G 0 ( D ) on conﬁnement very well . Moreover , the ratio of the prefactors for the two di ﬀ erent actin concentrations is in excellent agreement with the expected power - law increase of G 0 ∼ c 7 / 5 a , demonstrating the consistency of the factorization assumption . The mechanical e ﬀ ects of conﬁnement on semiﬂexible polymers in dilute and semidilute solutions thus seem analogous . Interestingly , our measurements of G 0 and ξ as well as our theoretical interpretation all suggest a gradual increase of the network heterogeneity and elasticity with progressive conﬁnement that could hardly have been guessed from microscopy , which is easily misled by the visual impression of an apparently more abrupt structural change in the conﬁned networks at D c . In addition to their potential relevance for the fundamental physics of semiﬂexible polymers , our results indicate that conﬁnement e ﬀ ects in cells might result in viscoelastic behaviour that is quantitatively very di ﬀ erent from what is expected from 188 naturephysics VOL2 MARCH2006 www . nature . com / naturephysics Untitled - 4 3 2 / 18 / 06 , 11 : 35 : 42 AM Nature Publishing Group ©200 6 LETTERS in vitro bulk measurements . We consistently interpreted our observations in terms of the reduction of the thermal ﬂuctuations of the individual polymers on conﬁnement . As our biomimetic microcavities allow for the controlled addition of actin - binding proteins and other cell constituents , they may become useful for relating the observed macroscopic viscoelastic properties of cells and their functional dependence on the action of various proteins to well - controlled microscopic system parameters 19 . The emulsion - droplet system is also ideal for the encapsulation and characterization of a well - deﬁned small number of polymers , which makes it a promising experimental tool to escort emerging detailed modelling e ﬀ orts of cortical networks on a molecular level 20 – 22 . Such a combined approach seems capable of ultimately providing a sound understanding of the physical principles behind the complex behaviour of cytoskeletal polymer networks . METHODS G - actin solutions were prepared by dissolving lyophilized G - actin in deionized water and dialysing against fresh G - Bu ﬀ er ( 2 mM Tris , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM DTT and 0 . 005 % NaN 3 ) at 4 ◦ C for 24 h . Actin polymerization was initiated by adding one - tenth of the sample volume of a tenfold concentrated F - bu ﬀ er ( 20 mM Tris , 20 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM DTT and 1 M KCl ) . After gentle mixing , 20 μ l of the solution was immediately transferred to 1 ml of a 0 . 25 mg mol − 1 SOPG ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) containing dodecane solution and emulsion droplets ( 2 vol % ) were prepared by vortexing . The negatively charged phospholipids stabilize the droplets against coagulation , inhibit the electrostatic adsorption of actin to the wall and thus mimic the presence of a ﬂuid membrane with essentially no bending undulations . Thus , only well - separated droplets were observed in the microscope . The actin - capping protein gelsolin was isolated from bovine plasma serum ( Cooper , 1987 No . 69 ) . The average length of the actin ﬁlaments ( 21 μ m ) was controlled by adding gelsolin before polymerization 23 and checked in representative drops by ﬂuorescence microscopy . The conformations of the encapsulated ﬁlaments were observed by ﬂuorescence microscopy of phalloidin - TRITC ( Sigma ) - labelled ﬁlaments at a very low actin concentration of 0 . 01 mg ml − 1 , where single ﬁlaments were visible . To prevent oxidation of the ﬂuorophore a standard antioxidant bu ﬀ er supplement ( Glukose – Oxidase , Sigma , 2 mg ; Catalase , Fluka , 0 . 5 mg ; and DTT ) was used . The local structure of the actin network in droplets was determined by digital video microscopy and subsequent particle tracking 24 of the thermal motion of incorporated carboxylated latex particles ( IDC ) with a radius a = 0 . 1 μ m comparable to the typical mesh size ξ ( ξ ≈ 0 . 3 c − 1 / 2 a μ m ) of the network 25 . At short times , the latex particles are able to di ﬀ use freely in the local pores , whereas at longer times the di ﬀ usion of the particles is slowed down by the presence of the surrounding network . The plateau in the mean - square displacement of individual particles at intermediate times τ can therefore be taken as a measure of the local pore size 26 , 27 ξ ≈ (cid:2) (cid:9) (cid:6) x 2 ( τ ) (cid:10) + a . The resulting pore size distributions were ﬁtted with a gaussian to obtain a mean pore size . To study the local viscoelastic response of the conﬁned actin network , we used superparamagnetic polystyrene beads ( Tosyl activated Dynabeads M - 450 , Dynal ) of a much larger radius a = 2 . 25 μ m (cid:11) ξ in a magnetic tweezers setup . Although there has been much debate about the relation of the frequency - dependent ‘moduli’ measured by microrheometry to those measured by macrorheometry , its has been demonstrated that the plateau shear modulus of actin solutions and gels , which is the quantity that matters most for our quantitative analysis , may be quantitatively determined by the microrheometric technique used 28 . To prevent the apolar polystyrene beads from moving to the dodecane phase , the beads were coated with Protein A ( Sigma ) according to the procedure provided by the supplier . Actin was polymerized in the presence of the colloidal particles . The emulsion was transferred to a Teﬂon tube holding a 20 μ l measuring chamber . After ﬁlling , the measuring chamber was closed by vacuum grease and a spherical plastic coverslip ( Polysciences ) and put onto the magnetic tweezers setup 29 . Slight adsorption of the droplets to the coverslip prevented droplet movement during the active rheology experiment . The concentration of magnetic particles was adjusted , so that on average only single particles were encapsulated in each emulsion droplet . We assume that the di ﬀ erence between a conﬁned and a free polymer can be represented very simply by a complete suppression of the thermal ﬂuctuations of the eigenmodes with wavenumber p i < p n = π / D . We denote the corresponding restricted thermal average by (cid:9)(cid:10) n . Within the Kratky – Porod or worm - like chain model , the corresponding restricted thermal transverse mean square ﬂuctuations (cid:9) r 2 (cid:10) n relative to the mean axis of a sti ﬀ polymer are then easily calculated : (cid:9) r 2 (cid:10) n = ∞ (cid:3) i = n 2 / Ll p p 4 i ∼ 2 / 3 π 4 l p D 3 ⇒ A ≈ 0 . 1 D 3 / 2 l − 1 / 2 p . We averaged the result along the whole contour ( indicated by the overbar ) , as the amplitude of the ﬂuctuations varies along the polymer as illustrated by the snapshots from Monte Carlo simulations in the inset of Fig . 2b .
