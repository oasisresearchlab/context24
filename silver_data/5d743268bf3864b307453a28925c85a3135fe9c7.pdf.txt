pubinvolve / chsp / Goal # 2 To increase safety belt use in MyTown . Objective 1 : To increase overall safety belt use rate by 5 % by September of 2008 . Objective 2 : To increase belt use rate for males aged 17 – 34 by 10 % by September 2008 . Goal # 1 To reduce the misuse of alcohol / drugs in MyTown . Objective 1 : To implement a mandatory alcohol server training program for all employees who serve alcohol by September 2008 . Objective 2 : To decrease the number of alcohol / drug related crashes in MyCounty from 45 % to 30 % of all crashes by September 2008 . Why are we doing what we are do - ing ? The state of Montana contracts with many others to assist them in achieving their traffic safety goals . A well - thought - out work plan is a critical part of supporting the state - wide effort and helps keep the fo - cus on the big picture . What are you trying to achieve and why ? That’s an easy question to answer with the help of our Problem Identification document . And how do you tell whether or not the project is a success once implemented ? That’s where per - formance measures come in . This year we must begin tying our work to the Comprehensive Highway Safety Plan . Don’t do this alone ! If you carry out the planning steps in consulta - tion with your coalition members , the result will be a much more ro - bust work plan . For more information on how to approach planning , read the article at www . mindtools . com / pages / article / newPPM _ 86 . htm An excellent resource is also avail - able from the North Dakota De - partment of Transportation . Re - quest a copy from SHTSB today ! Framing the year with purpose Performance indicators Performance indicators are the specific measures used to monitor progress . A good indicator must be : Valid— it must measure the in - tended result . Reliable —the measure must be consistently attained over time . Sensitive —the measure should respond to changes , and should identify if things are going wrong sufficiently quickly . Simple —the measure should be easy to collect or perform . Useful —it must help with decision making or provide information for future learning . Affordable —you need to be able to afford the financial and time costs involved in taking the meas - urement on a regular basis . Using these criteria , for each goal , purpose , output and activity , indi - cate what will be used to determine whether it was successfully achieved . Also , note who will be responsible for setting these tar - gets . Then indicate exactly how you will verify that achievement . What sources of data will you use ? How will you collect the data ? How often ? Make sure that appropriate activi - ties are in place within your plan to set up and manage these monitor - ing activities . www . mindtools . com / pages / article / newPPM _ 86 . htm Performance planning Page 2 Goals and objectives Goals should be written as a broad statement that is at - tainable and will usually lack a specific time element . They are generally long term . See sidebars on page 1 for examples . Objectives should be writ - ten with specific activities and outcomes that will be used to achieve goals . They are generally short term and measurable . Realistic To be realistic , a goal must represent an objective toward which you are both willing and able to work . A goal can be both high and realistic . Be sure that every goal represents substantial progress . A high goal is frequently easier to reach than a low one because a low goal exerts low motivational force . Time - based A goal should be grounded within a time frame . With no time frame tied to it , there’s no sense of urgency . For example , if you want to lose 10 lbs , when do you want to lose it by ? “Someday” won’t work . But if you anchor it within a time frame , e . g . “by May 1st” , then you’ve set your unconscious mind into motion to begin working on the goal . www . topachievement . com / smart . html Writing S . M . A . R . T objectives Specific A specific target has a much greater chance of being accomplished than a general one . To help you in setting a specific target , answer the six “W” questions : • Who is involved ? • What do I want to accomplish ? • Where ? Identify a location . • When ? Establish a time frame . • Which ? Identify requirements and constraints . • Why ? Specific reasons , purpose or benefits of accomplishing the goal . Example : A general goal would be , “Get in shape . ” But a specific goal would say , “Join a health club and workout 3 days a week . ” Measurable Establish concrete criteria for measuring progress toward the attainment of each goal set . When you measure your progress , you stay on track , reach your target dates , and experience the exhilaration of achievement that spurs you on to continued effort required to reach your goal . Achievable When you identify goals that are most important to you , you begin to figure out ways you can make them come true . You develop the attitudes , abilities , skills , and financial capacity to reach them . You begin seeing previously overlooked opportunities to bring yourself closer to the achievement of your goals . You can attain most any goal you set when you plan your steps wisely and establish a time frame that allows you to carry out those steps . Goals that may have seemed far away and out of reach eventually move closer and become attainable , not because your goals shrink , but because you grow and expand to match them .

A successful project needs to be con - ducted where people work , eat , do busi - ness , play together , learn , read , listen , be healed , worship , and participate in public life . As a result , all sectors of the community should be involved to achieve the most success in a project . See the sample campaign outlined on the next page . The community sectors to be contacted and involved are listed in the sidebar . It’s also a good idea to recruit participa - tion from every sector for a well - rounded coalition . Are we reaching the whole community ? Law enforcement ( LE ) officers are very important partners for us . Here are some practical things you can do to build relationships with them : • Bring drinks and snacks to safety spot checks . Participate to the ex - tent agreed upon , including set up and take - down , distributing infor - mation , etc . • Write letters to the editor support - ing and recognizing LE agencies in general , and , when warranted , indi - vidual officers . • Host local recognition ceremonies honoring law enforcement . , e . g . appreciation breakfast , annual award event . LE agencies could nominate officers based on your award crite - ria , e . g . officer with the most safety belt citations . Collaborate with other groups who are interested in recognizing law enforcement , e . g . Building relationships with law enforcement Kiwanis Club . Traffic enforcement officers are the unsung heroes of law enforcement . The jobs they perform have the potential to save more lives than any other enforce - ment effort . • Offer to bring interesting new video clips to roll - call ( pre - shift briefing for officers ) . Become the person that educates and inspires them to do effective traffic stops . • Offer officers opportunities to par - ticipate in responsible alcohol sales & service training sessions . • Offer the reserve deputies opportu - nities to participate , e . g . doing bar checks in plain clothes . • Don’t forget to include officers from the Montana Department of Fish , Wildlife & Parks ( game war - dens ) .

Restrained motorists receive compliments , and those that are not are strongly encouraged to buckle up . Citations for not using safety belts are usually not issued during the event by the police officers , but the motoring public are told that buckling up is a law and the law will be enforced the next time they are stopped . The local print and broadcast media should be notified in advance to alert them to scheduled event . News re - leases should be issued again the day before the event to announce to the media the important purpose of the event , and the wide commu - nity - based participation . Special instructions are given to vehicles where children are found unrestrained or im - properly restrained . A child safety seat check can also be offered if trained personnel are available . If appropriate , loaner seats from the police department or another source can also be made available for distribu - tion at this event . Safety belt surveys before and after the event demonstrate how effective the activity was in your community . A full event organization manual is available online at the link provided or by con - tacting your program manager at the State Highway Traffic Safety Bureau . Walk in our shoes A “Walk in our shoes” event offers the citizens an opportu - nity to benefit from the experiences of the nurses , police officers , paramedics , and firefighters in their com - munities . These professionals have seen senseless injuries and have cared for people whose lives were lost because of unsafe practices . The program philosophy is very simple . If the citizens could just walk in the shoes of these professionals , for just one day , they would know how frustrating it is for the nurses , emergency medical personnel and law enforce - ment officers to see the need - less toll of injuries and deaths from motor vehicle crashes . Walk in our shoes involves the representatives from the vari - ous medical , police and public safety organizations in a com - munity , spending a few hours together distributing traffic safety materials to motorists . Motorists are contacted while stopped at a traffic light .

Next , let the DOCS have their say . Their message should offer strong support for the traffic enforcement effort which will decrease crashes and prevent injuries . The prevention message can also emphasize the cost sav - ings—injury costs are sky high ! Societal savings by prevention injuries can also be applied to other pressing needs . DOCS can identify crash victims will - ing to participate in a news event . Their emotional stories can be compelling and riveting , making a strong impact on the public . Creative ways to spice up your kick - off event or on - going program activities • Have several enforcement units standing by during the event . At the end , let the commanding officer issue the order for the enforce - ment to begin . The patrol units could then move out in formation . • Stage a mock crash and have an emergency medical services unit or rescue heli - copter show exactly how they would respond in a real incident . • Invite a crash victim to de - scribe the effects on the family as a result of a crash with an impaired driver • Use a safety belt convincer to help illustrate the dynam - ics of a crash . Include a large doll that goes through the “crash” unbuckled to show how results differ between buckling and un - buckling . • With a wrecked car in the background , present a sur - vivor’s award such as “Saved by the belt” to an individual who escaped injury in a crash because of the correct use of safety restraints / air bags . This is effective with any survivor , especially a photogenic tod - dler . • Hold a news event outside a hospital emergency depart - ment with ambulances and patrol cars parked side by side . • Invite rehabilitation physi - cians to speak about the long - term effects of crashes , especially brain injuries . • Get hospital administrators to discuss the cost of crashes , the needless drain on medial resources , the dramatic increase in health insurance costs , and related issues . Cops & Docs Cops & Docs is a prescription for saving lives and preventing injuries in your community . Physicians know prevention is the best medicine and law en - forcement officers can provide just what the doctor ordered . To get started , you need to identify a community leader to serve as a champion for the program . It may be someone from the injury prevention field , an enforcement agency , a local hospital , or other group . Once you have a sponsor , three basic commitments are needed . 1 . A commitment by law enforcement agencies to conduct enhanced traffic safety / enforcement cam - paigns during identified periods . 2 . A commitment by the medical community , in - cluding prominent physi - cians , nurses , emergency medical technicians , and public health profession - als , to vocally support the enforcement of traffic laws and to actively in - form the public of the cost in lives and dollars result - ing from motor vehicle crashes . 3 . A commitment by both COPS and DOCS to con - duct vigorous public awareness activities , such as : • staging a kick - off media event • issuing regular news re - leases • sending editorials to print COPS work hard to prevent traffic crashes by enforcing the laws on impaired driving , speeding , safety belts , and other hazardous violations . DOCS do their best to repair broken bodies , many of them victims of traffic crashes . All too often , the victim never fully recovers . Page 6 COPS & DOCS works best to serve your community’s traffic safety needs when it is designed as an on - going program which forges a lasting union between law enforcement , medical professionals , and highway safety advocates . It is a great way to gain powerful new partners in injury prevention and broaden the base for community action . Impaired driving prevention Page 7 This year , _ families in MyTown will set their tables , and sit down to a holiday dinner . Their smiles will be fixed , their laughter forced , and their holiday cheer firmly in place with the intention of making sure that everything will be as it always has been . But the holidays , as every day since “that day” and every day to come , will never again be the same . This year , there is one less place at the table—the “empty” place . The place where a family member would be—should be , if he or she hadn’t been involved in an alcohol - related crash . While an “empty place” is not truly set at the table , an empty place exists in the heart of every family member and friend whose life changed forever the day an alcohol - impaired individual got behind the wheel of a vehicle instead of calling a friend or cab , or having planned to use a designated driver . Empty dinner party The Empty Dinner Party is a creative way to put a face on fatal motor vehicle crash statistics . With Montana’s small population , a tragedy often hits an entire community . The Empty Dinner Party uses the idea that “everyone knows everybody else’s business” to its advantage . At each empty seat is a place card identifying the age and gender of the person who was killed and other contributing factors , such as Joe Brown—male , age 25 Died 6 - 20 - 2003 , Sidney , MT Alcohol ; Did not wear safety belt . Residents may remember Joe… perhaps he ran the local hardware store… and recollect how his loss personally affected family and friends , and the community at large when his business closed . Suddenly a statistic like , “In 2006 , 75 % of traffic crash fatalities in My County were alcohol - related , ” becomes personal . To the people who see The Empty Dinner Party , we hope that statistic becomes , “Oh wow . That’s Dave . He went to my church . I remember Chris . He was in my daughter’s math class…” In North Dakota DOT’s campaign , families were encouraged to bring photos or mementos to the empty place setting that represented their deceased family member . Not only was this a great way for families to honor the memory of their loved ones , but it communicated in a very visual way to the rest of the community that impaired DUI Campaign Graphically Illustrates Loss of Life with Empty Dinner Tables 175 persons were killed on ND roads in the past 3 years alone .

Sample news release Impaired driving prevention Page 8 Every child deserves a sober driver A 2005 report issued by Mothers Against Drunk Driving outlines weakness in state laws against child endangerment and calls for increase penalties and more training and awareness about the problem .

Victim impact panel Work with area rehabilitation centers to create a victim impact panel : a group of volunteers whose lives have been dramatically altered by an impaired driver . The panel tells their stories to court - mandated DUI offenders . In neighboring North Dakota , the numbers of repeat DUI offenders for those who have gone through a VIP has decreased . They also do some anecdotal evaluation and the impact on those in attendance is quite overwhelming . Do outreach to rehabilitation facilities on the reservations and see if you can help them establish a VIP , customized for their own culture . Judges do tend to like VIPs once they actually get on board ( sometimes it takes a while . ) They like the alternative sentencing aspect . Performance measure tip : Keep data on the attendees and identify the numbers of repeat offenders that come through . Aim to reduce the number . Research shows that first - time offenders arrested for drunk driving have driven drunk more than 87 times before their first arrest .

More communities across the nation are expanding their underage drinking prevention strategies to include parents , especially during graduation season . Social host liability laws ( also known as teen party ordinances , loud or unruly gathering ordinances , or response costs ordinances ) target the location in which underage drinking takes place . Social host liability laws hold non - commercial individuals responsible for underage drinking events on property they own , lease , or otherwise control . At the local level , cities and counties have at least three options for implementing social host laws : Infraction . Some municipalities treat social host liability as a criminal matter , but the penalty is , at most , an infraction that carries with it a monetary fine rather than jail time . Misdemeanor . Some municipalities treat social host liability as a misdemeanor , in the same way some states do , carrying possible jail time as a penalty . Response Costs Recovery Ordinances .

Yet for today ‘s teenagers , alcohol is the number one drug of choice . It is considered “cool “ by many teens to drink as much as they can in social situations involving their peers . Few if any of these young people think about the consequences . In this program , teens who are current drinkers see firsthand what the future may hold for them if they continue to drink . They experience the potential consequences of alcohol use from every perspective , including : how drinking impairs a person’s coordination , vision , and reaction time ; how the brain and other organs suffer lasting damage from alcohol use ; how a drunk person really drives ; and how drinking can lead to spending months in a rehabilitation center . The program culminates in a realistic simulation of the “deaths” of three participants who got into a car with a fourth who was driving drunk . The teens watch videotape of their parents’ reaction to the news . The driver is then “booked” and sent to prison . The three victims visit the coroner’s office to learn of the fatal injuries each suffered in the crash . Finally , the foursome attend the funerals of the three who “died” in the crash and listen as their parents read farewell tributes to their children . By the close of the program , all of the young participants are moved to stop their reckless drinking behavior . The video is $ 160 . If there is sufficient interest , SHTSB may purchase and loan out the video . Page 12 Impaired driving prevention Every 15 minutes www . every15minutes . com Life’s lessons are best learned through experience . Unfortunately , when the target audience is teens and the topic is drinking and driving , experience is not the teacher of choice . The Every 15 Minutes program offers real - life experience without the real - life risks . This emotionally charged program , entitled Every 15 Minutes , is an event designed to dramatically instill teenagers with the potentially dangerous consequences of drinking alcohol . This powerful program will challenge students to think about drinking , personal safety , and the responsibility of making mature decisions when lives are involved . Day 1 During the first day events the “Grim Reaper” calls students who have been selected from a cross - section of the entire student body out of class . One student is removed from class every 15 minutes . A police officer immediately enters the classroom to read an obituary which has been written by the “dead” student’s parent ( s ) - explaining the circumstances of their classmate’s demise and the contributions the student has made to the school and the community . A few minutes later , the student returns to class as the “living dead , ” complete with white face make - up , a coroner’s tag , and a black Every 15 Minutes T - shirt . From that point on , “victims” do not speak or interact with other students for the remainder of the school day . Simultaneously , uniformed officers make mock death notifications to the parents of these children at their home , place of employment or business . After lunch , a simulated traffic collision is viewable on the school grounds . Rescue workers treat injured student participants . These students experience first hand the sensations of being involved in a tragic , alcohol - related collision . The coroner handles fatalities on the scene , while the injured students are extricated by the jaws - of - life manned by fire - fighters and paramedics . Police officers investigate , arrest , and book the student “drunk driver” . Student participants continue their experience with an actual trip to the morgue , the hospital emergency room , and / or to the jail for the purpose of being booked for “drunk driving” . At the end of the day , those students who participated in the staged accident as well as those who were made - up as the “living dead” are transported to a local hotel for an overnight student retreat . The retreat simulates the separation from friends and family . A support staff of counselors and police officers facilitates the retreat . During the most powerful program of the retreat , the students are taken through an audio - visualization of their own death . Then each student writes a letter to his or her parents starting out with . . . “ Dear Mom and Dad , every fifteen minutes someone in the United States dies from an alcohol related traffic collision , and today I died . I never had the chance to tell you . . . . . . . ” Parents are asked to write similar letters to their children . These letters will be shared on day two when students and parents are reunited at a school assembly . The students engage in “Challenge Day” exercises . Impaired simulator goggles are used to allow students to experience firsthand the potentially fatal consequences of alcohol and drug impairment . The goggles allow students the opportunity to understand the dangers of impaired driving without taking a drop of alcohol or using drugs of any type . Research shows that those who learn from hands - on experience retain two to four times more than those who learn from just listening , or from listening and seeing . Day 2 On the following morning , a mock funeral service is held at the High School . The assembly begins with a video of normal school day activities including scenes from the first day of the “Grim Reaper” and the staged accident . The assembly is hosted by an Officer ( Project Coordinator ) , who guides the audience through the devastating effects of losing a loved one due to a bad choice . Speakers include students who read letters to their parents , police officers , and hospital personnel who share their emotional trauma of dealing with kids killed in crashes . Parents share their personal reflections of their involvement in this program . If possible , include a powerful speaker who actually lost a child to an impaired driver . The focus of the assembly stresses that the decision to consume alcohol can affect many more people than just the one who drinks . This very emotional and heart - wrenching event will illustrate to students the potentially dangerous consequences of their use of alcohol , regardless of how casual they believe their use may be . This event includes the participation of police and fire departments , high school staff , the local hospital , a video production crew , community officials , the district attorney’s office and a wide cross - section of the community at - large . The goal is to utilize the strength , talent and resources of business and industry to prevent impaired driving . Page 13 Impaired driving prevention 30 Seconds of Silence Impaired driving is the number one killer of young people in Montana . Many of the drivers and passengers who died in alcohol - related crashes on Montana roadways were high school age . To call attention to this tragic and preventable loss of lives , play a taped message before a home football or basketball game asking the crowd to observe thirty seconds of silence in respect of those who have lost their lives . The taped message can feature the head coach , team captain or local celebrity . To help call attention to this loss , the cheerleading squad and band can get involved by wearing patches on their uniforms with a number that represents the lives lost in alcohol - related crashes on Montana roads last year .

You may find them in the bottom of the bucket used to wash the car or under the oil rags .

S . Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) and the Advertising Council’s Innocent Victims public service campaign emphasizes the need to intervene and Get the Keys away from someone about to drive drunk . But sometimes this is easier said than done . Below are some helpful tips and advice from focus group research on how people can Get the Keys away from a drunk driver : • If it is a close friend , try and use a soft , calm approach at first . Suggest to them that they’ve had too much to drink and it would be better if someone else drove or if they took a cab . • Be calm . Joke about it . Make light of it . • Try to make it sound like you are doing them a favor . • If it is somebody you don’t know well , speak to their friends and have them make an attempt to persuade them to hand over the keys . Usually they will listen . • If it’s a good friend , spouse , or significant other , tell them that if they insist on driving , you are not going with them . Suggest that you will call someone else for a ride , take a cab , or walk . • Locate their keys while they are preoccupied and take them away . Most likely , they will think they’ve lost them and will be forced to find another mode of transportation . • If possible , avoid embarrassing the person or being confrontational , particularly when dealing with men . This makes them appear vulnerable to alcohol and its effects .

However , too often lost in the active search for answers are the unsung heroes of this ongoing battle . It is the state , county , city , and Tribal law enforcement officers who perform the often unrecognized work of removing from our roadways those who would endanger us by driving impaired . It is for their efforts that we offer our undying gratitude and support and dedicate this work . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 2 The Impaired Driving Subcommittee ( IDSC ) would like to acknowledge the leadership and support of Earl Sweeney , the IACP Highway Safety Committee Chair and Assistant Commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Safety . The work of the IDSC was made possible through the volunteer efforts of Subcommittee members and through the financial support of the International Association of Chiefs of Police , Mothers Against Drunk Driving , and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration .

Wise @ madd . org FOREWORD 5 After seeing impressive reductions in total traffic fatalities and those involving impaired driving in the late 1980s and early 1990s , most states are now making nominal gains , while others are losing ground in their battle to eliminate deaths and injuries caused by impaired drivers . According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) , in the U . S . in 2004 , 16 , 694 people were killed in crashes involving alcohol , representing 39 % of the 42 , 636 people killed in all traffic crashes . Based on early estimates , NHTSA projects a nearly 2 % increase in alcohol - related traffic fatalities in 2005 . These crashes cost our society over $ 100 billion annually , including approximately $ 51 billion in monetary costs and $ 63 billion in quality - of - life losses . 1 Furthermore , research indicates that alcohol is not the only part of the impaired driving problem . Drugs alone—or in combination with alcohol , both prescription and illicit—are increasingly being found in chemical tests of at - fault drivers in fatal and injury crashes . Law enforcement is only now becoming proficient at detecting the drug - impaired driver and collecting data that reflects the nature and extent of drug impairment in crashes . In 2005 , the International Association of Chiefs of Police ( IACP ) Highway Safety Committee established the Impaired Driving Subcommittee ( IDSC ) to work with NHTSA , the Governor’s Highway Safety Association ( GHSA ) , and Mothers Against Drunk Driving ( MADD ) to determine how we can substantially reduce impaired driving in the United States and Canada , and the associated traffic fatalities and injuries caused by impaired driving . The IDSC is made up of 20 safety experts from government , law enforcement , and MADD . The IDSC developed a mission statement to steer them toward the desired outcome of this project : The Subcommittee then decided on two deliverables . The first is this Guidebook that is intended to serve as a guide to law enforcement executives on how to most effectively renew their efforts to eliminate impaired driving on our roadways . The second deliverable is an IACP Resolution . The Resolution ( Appendix A ) was approved by the Highway Safety Committee at its mid - year meeting in June 2006 and forwarded to the IACP for adoption during the 2006 IACP annual meeting in October . Using this Resolution as a model , the National Sheriffs’ Association ( NSA ) adopted a similar resolution at their annual meeting in June 2006 . The Subcommittee came to agreement that success lies in three key areas , and this Guidebook has a section dedicated to each : (cid:144) Law Enforcement Leadership ; (cid:144) Criminal Justice Collaboration ; and (cid:144) Effective Communication Strategies . Instead of working independently toward a common goal , IACP , NHTSA , MADD , NSA , GHSA , the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators ( AAMVA ) , and other key stakeholders have forged an alliance and are more closely coordinating their efforts to create a synergy to help us eliminate impaired driving . The immediate goal is to meet NHTSA’s 1 . 0 deaths per million miles traveled benchmark , followed by ultimately attaining our goal of zero deaths on our state , provincial , county , local , and Tribal highways , streets , and roads . The IACP Highway Safety Committee’s Impaired Driving Subcommittee will provide recommendations to substantially reduce impaired driving traffic fatalities and injuries through enhanced enforcement . EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 6 Impaired driving continues to be one of North America’s greatest and most persistent threats to public safety . Impaired driving leads cancer and all other causes of death for those persons ages 3 to 33 years old , regardless of race , gender , or any other factor , and our society is poised to support the law enforcement community’s need to take a lead role to end this epidemic . There are many public and non - profit agencies and entities focused on the elimination of impaired driving , but there is often a lack of sustained coordination in their efforts . The IDSC prepared an IACP Resolution ( Appendix A ) to encourage a renewed effort from every law enforcement agency to work vigorously toward the elimination of impaired driving . However , this Resolution is only the first step in a chain of events that is intended to create a new momentum to make elimination of impaired driving a reality . The IDSC developed this Guidebook as the next step in creating the desired momentum . The target audience includes state , provincial , county , local , and Tribal police executives and their agencies . Whether your agency is already strategically focused on eliminating impaired driving or you are contemplating making it a high priority , this Guidebook is intended to serve as a resource to assist you in that effort . Additionally , as a result of President Bush’s August 2005 signing of the “Safe , Accountable , Flexible , Efficient Transportation Equity Act : A Legacy for Users” ( SAFETEA - LU ) federal highway reauthorization bill , every state must submit a Strategic Highway Safety Plan ( SHSP ) outlining how all levels and areas of government will work together to make each state’s roadways safer . Law enforcement must take advantage of this opportunity to leverage additional resources through each state’s SHSP to augment current resources allocated to eliminate impaired driving . As indicated by the title , the Subcommittee’s research has found that success lies in three key areas : Leadership , Criminal Justice Collaboration , and Communication . The cover photos reflect each of those three areas . Leadership Strong leadership is the first key to success in renewing our efforts to eliminate impaired driving . Although this Guidebook is meant for law enforcement executives , leadership is needed throughout all levels and agencies of government . This section of the Guidebook provides recommendations on actionable items that police executives can focus on within their agencies , as well as external actions that often serve as a catalyst to galvanize our partners and perpetuate success . Leadership is also needed to ensure that traffic law enforcement is viewed among both the law enforcement community and the public as “real police work . ” Traffic law enforcement has already proven to be an effective means of crime prevention by interdicting criminal behavior and terrorism before crimes are committed . The theories contained in “Fixing Broken Windows , ” which proved highly successful in reducing crimes and improving quality of life , are easily transferable to traffic law enforcement . Leadership is also needed throughout law enforcement organizations to ensure that scant resources are appropriately focused and that an agency’s field activities support desired EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 7 outcomes . Accountability Driven Leadership models such as TrafficStat ( New York Police Department ) and Strategic Advancement Forums ( Washington State Patrol ) are models already being emulated throughout law enforcement and other government agencies in the United States to promote leadership , accountability , and efficiency . In addition to ensuring aggressive impaired driving enforcement is occurring in your agency , executive leadership should : (cid:144) Develop strong support among government leaders ; (cid:144) Sponsor or participate in meaningful awards and recognition programs to provide positive reinforcement for impaired driving enforcement ; and (cid:144) Publicly support advancements in automotive and enforcement technologies for sensing impairment . Criminal Justice Collaboration Partnering and collaborating with other agencies and entities in order to combine resources can serve as a “force multiplier” and can achieve results that no single entity could accomplish alone . In order to eliminate impaired driving , each jurisdiction should identify the steps necessary to achieve success , develop an actionable plan to achieve that success , implement the plan , regularly examine the results , and repeat the process . This section of the Guidebook provides examples of potential partnerships and collaborations that are intra - disciplinary , inter - disciplinary , and system - wide , and it provides several proven methods for building relationships . In support of this effort , Appendix B provides a list of some of the best Internet resources available ; and Appendix C lists potential partners from national organizations and associations , as well as federal , state , and local partners . Communication Effective internal and external communication is the third key to success in renewing our effort to eliminate impaired driving . Law enforcement leaders must take affirmative measures to “sell” impaired driving enforcement to both their officers and to the public . A proactive public relations strategy is essential to reaching diverse audiences for effective impaired driving enforcement . This section of the Guidebook also explains the role of the Governor’s Highway Safety Office and provides information on how law enforcement executives can effectively engage the media . There are many strategies that can and should be deployed in the fight against impaired driving , most notably sustained high visibility enforcement . Research has shown that strong and effective laws—combined with highly visible enforcement— reduces impaired driving and other crimes as well . LEADERSHIP 8 LAW ENFORCEMENT LEADERSHIP It is understood that law enforcement cannot solve the impaired driving problem alone . Clearly , we must work effectively in collaboration with , and in support of , our partners and stakeholders . This is why an entire section of this publication is dedicated to Partnerships and Collaborations . However , it is critical that law enforcement leaders prioritize activities aimed at reducing incidents of impaired driving and related crashes that too often result in fatalities and disabling injuries . As law enforcement leaders at national , state , and local levels , we must deliver a clear and consistent message of support and encouragement for strengthened enforcement initiatives . It is acknowledged that most law enforcement agencies are dealing with increased demands , less staff , and reduced funding . We must continually and effectively motivate our officers through leadership and clear direction of the need to prioritize traffic law enforcement . Why ? In addition to the potential to significantly reduce impaired driving and related crashes , there is unlimited potential for another positive consequence— CRIME REDUCTION . In the 1990s , many law enforcement agencies focused on “the little things” and adapted the “Fixing Broken Windows” strategy to their goals and objectives 2 . By quickly addressing seemingly insignificant crimes , law enforcement deterred people from committing larger crimes and drove down the general crime rate 3 . We should apply the same strategy to traffic law enforcement . The jurisdictions that have implemented this strategy have experienced tremendous success . More citizens formally encounter law enforce - ment through traffic stops than by any other means . The Bureau of Justice Statistics reported in 2002 that almost 17 million citizens encounter law enforcement officers during traffic stops or investigations ( this represented approximately 40 % of all officer - civilian contacts ! 4 ) . By prioritizing traffic law enforcement , we cannot only curtail impaired driving , we will reduce crime overall . Institutionalize your commitment by incor - porating traffic safety goals into your department’s strategic plan . In addition to including relevant goals and objectives , require and track performance measures , such as DUI arrests ( output measures ) , in support of the reduction of traffic fatalities and injuries ( outcome measures ) . The IACP Highway Safety Committee supports the following actions that would assist law enforcement leaders in renewing our collective efforts to significantly reduce impaired driving : (cid:144) Encourage law enforcement member agencies to revisit their policies and goals regarding impaired driving . (cid:144) Encourage the State Association of Chiefs of Police ( SACOP ) to endorse , publicize , and aggressively seek participation by their members in sustained high - visibility impaired driving enforcement . (cid:144) Institute management and personnel accounta - bility systems specific to crash and enforcement activity ( e . g . , TrafficStat , Strategic Advancement Forums 5 ) . (cid:144) Ensure that enforcement of impaired driving is an agency priority mission . Provide officers with the time , training , and tools required to perform this mission as effectively as possible . (cid:144) Create state , regional , and local DUI enforce - ment task forces that will produce increased high - visibility enforcement . Increased enforce - ment should be directly tied to NHTSA’s new National Crackdown Plan ( see Appendix B for the NHTSA Web address ) . (cid:144) Law enforcement agencies should actively pursue alternate funding sources to support DUI enforcement , training , and equipment . Potential sources include : ⎯ Federal , state , and local grants ⎯ Insurance companies ⎯ Local civic groups ⎯ State - level legislation for dedicated DUI cost recovery funding to arresting agencies ⎯ Private corporations ⎯ Not - for - profit groups For additional information on funding , see the IACP’s Highway Safety Deskbook 6 . (cid:144) Encourage the International Association of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training ( IADLEST ) to continue its endorsement of the use of NHTSA’s standardized field sobriety test training as part of all post - mandated curriculum and to join in a renewed effort to ensure that all levels of law enforcement training contain a solid emphasis on impaired driving enforcement strategies , tactics , and techniques . LEADERSHIP 9 (cid:144) Encourage the FBI National Academy law enforcement leadership program to include traffic law enforcement management in its curriculum . (cid:144) Support technology development . The most current technology and development of new technology can further reduce impaired driving and assist in detecting those who do drive impaired . (cid:144) Institute awards and recognition . ⎯ IACP Law Enforcement Challenge ⎯ State - Level Awards ⎯ Agency - Level Awards ⎯ www . madd . org / madd _ programs / 10287 contains information on law enforcement recognition programs . Awards and Recognition Recognition for a job well done is fundamental to achieving positive reinforcement and promotion of agency goals and objectives . This is especially true in law enforcement disciplines such as traffic safety , where tasks are repetitive and sometimes tedious , and the connection between the enforce - ment action ( ticket or summons ) and the outcome ( lives saved ) may not be readily apparent . Law enforcement executives are usually quick to praise the officer who apprehends a fleeing suspect in an assault or homicide , but often neglect to provide such praise to the officers who routinely prevent the perpetration of such crimes in an automobile . Officers who actively enforce impaired driving laws are preventing assaults and homicides and deserve praise and recognition for their efforts . This type of recognition promotes similar behavior among other officers . In addition to internal recognition , a variety of highway safety organizations provide recognition for outstanding impaired driving enforcement efforts by individual officers and their agencies . These awards programs enhance self - esteem with the department and are invaluable to promoting community rela - tions and public support for the department . National - Level Awards The International Association of Chiefs of Police ( IACP ) Law Enforcement Challenge is a competition among similar sizes and types of law enforcement agencies . It recognizes and rewards the best overall traffic safety programs in the United States . The areas of concentration include efforts to enforce laws and educate the public about occupant protection , impaired driving , and speeding . Agencies submit an application that documents their efforts and effectiveness in these areas . The winning safety programs are those that combine officer training , public information , and enforcement to reduce crashes and injuries within its jurisdiction . Further information can be found online at www . theiacp . org / awards / NLEC . State - Level Awards Law enforcement officials seeking recognition for their departments or officers should investigate the available state - level awards programs in which they can participate . A variety of awards are presented to agencies and individuals at the state level . These awards vary greatly from state to state as to eligibility , application , and host agencies , but law enforcement executives and their impaired driving enforcement programs can benefit greatly by participating in these awards programs . In many states , the programs are a state version of the IACP Law Enforcement Challenge . Agency - Level Awards Law enforcement leaders should recognize the efforts of their officers who contribute significantly to reducing impaired driving through both internal recognition and by submitting those officers to local service clubs and their state MADD executive director for possible recognition . GOVERNMENT LEADERSHIP It is difficult , if not impossible , to accomplish substantial improvements in reducing incidents of impaired driving and related crashes without strong support of our government leaders . Successful strategies targeting impaired driving must have support from all levels of government . National , state , county , municipal , and Tribal leaders must be lobbied for legislative , financial , and moral support . At the federal level , the Secretary of Transportation and Attorney General’s Office have identified impaired driving as a core enforcement priority . In 2005 , Congress passed the landmark Safe , Accountable , Flexible , Efficient Transportation Equity Act : A Legacy for Users ( SAFETEA - LU ) , signed into law by President Bush on August 10 , 2005 . SAFETEA - LU provides unprecedented funding for traffic safety initiatives that focus on driver behavior . SAFETEA - LU also provides an impetus for multi - disciplinary cooperation by requiring the states to bring together Each year , alcohol - related crashes in the United States cost about $ 51 billion .

Likewise , governors , legislators , mayors , county managers , city managers , and local governing bodies have a major role in reshaping the public perception of what is acceptable in their communities . At every opportunity , we must assist them in developing and delivering a clear , con - sistent message : “ Impaired driving is unacceptable . ” The Highway Safety Committee , Impaired Driving Subcommittee , supports the following actions in engaging our government leaders to address the impaired driving problem : (cid:144) Contact the State’s Highway Safety Office ; ask that current crash and enforcement data be sent to various levels of governmental leadership to establish baselines and benchmarks for state and local governments . (cid:144) Announce statewide goals for active parti - cipation in enforcement campaigns that coincide with national initiatives and public information and education programs . (cid:144) Work with your state chiefs’ and sheriffs’ associa - tions and highway safety offices to encourage state legislatures to pass effective laws that are reasonable and enforceable . (cid:144) Identify a key individual ( e . g . , state senator , member of Congress ) who will champion law enforcement efforts . Formally recognize this person’s efforts . (cid:144) Solicit local and county government leaders for support of law enforcement efforts . Consistent support of enforcement strategies will send a clear message that chiefs and sheriffs have the support of their government leaders . PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR TECHNOLOGY Technological advancements have been made in both law enforcement and automotive safety in recent years . A variety of automotive interlock sensors and other passive devices are currently under development to prevent impaired drivers from jeopardizing safety . Similarly , advances in fields of medicine , engineering , and micro - electronics hold great promise in eradicating impaired driving in the near future . Law enforcement executives should support the development of these technologies to reduce or eliminate impaired driving in the future . (cid:144) Prioritize activities aimed at reducing impaired driving . (cid:144) Deliver a clear and consistent message of support and encouragement . (cid:144) Apply the “Fixing Broken Windows” strategy to traffic law enforcement . (cid:144) Use statistics to ensure that resources are applied where they are needed most . (cid:144) Institute management and personnel accountability . (cid:144) Create state , regional , and local impaired driving enforcement task forces to increase the visibility of enforcement . (cid:144) Use standardized field sobriety test training as part of all post - mandated curricula . (cid:144) Support technology development . (cid:144) Institute award and recognition pro - grams . Summing it up… CRIMINAL JUSTICE COLLABORATION 11 PARTNERSHIPS AND COLLABORATIONS Over a decade ago , the American Medical Association ( AMA ) recognized that alcohol - related traffic crashes are a “leading cause of unintentional injury and deaths and a substantial contributor to health care costs in the United States . ” 7 There is no absolute right to drive . 8 People who risk their own lives , let alone the lives of others , by driving while impaired by alcohol and / or drugs should not be allowed to drive . General deterrence is the key to curtailing impaired driving . Deterrence is based on sustained high visibility law enforcement , coupled with swift and certain punishment . Traditionally , we—as high - way safety professionals , advocates , law enforce - ment officers , prosecutors , and other stakeholders— worked separately . Our efforts have achieved moderate success . Working together , we can do so much more . Proven Collaborations Intra - Disciplinary Partnerships Stakeholders often can reap great benefits by partnering with others within their discipline . There are many examples of intra - disciplinary collabor - ations that work well , including : (cid:144) Enforcement Collaboration Law enforcement agencies have achieved tremendous success sharing best practices and resources . Doing this leads to more effective training , sobriety check points , saturation patrols , task forces , and use of equipment . It also promotes consistency and enhances working relationships between city , county , state , and Tribal police agencies . (cid:144) Toxicology Collaboration Toxicologists have joined together to form professional alliances that allow them to share knowledge , address complicated issues , and further develop their expertise . Inter - Disciplinary Partnerships There are numerous effective strategies and tactics that can be relied upon . All of them , however , are dependent upon public support . Accordingly , stakeholders usually can accomplish more by breaking traditional boundaries and work - ing with other disciplines . By expanding productive partnerships and advancing collaboration , law enforcement agencies can gain vital support , amplify available resources , and share ownership for traffic safety enforcement programs and activities . The payback for expanding partnerships is well worth the investment . There are many excellent examples of positive inter - disciplinary collaborations : (cid:144) Enforcement / Adjudication Collaboration ( state vehicle administrators , traffic safety resource prosecutors , local prosecutors , and judges ) : These professionals have worked together in many jurisdictions to identify paperwork issues , address workload and plea bargain issues , expand BAC testing , and improve case preparation and quality . (cid:144) Enforcement / Community Collaboration ( business leaders , community leaders , organizations , minority leaders , alcohol and drug abuse treatment and health agencies , and advocacy groups such as MADD ) : These professionals have collaborated to generate support for enforcement efforts , provide increased visibility during special mobilization efforts , obtain additional resources for special projects ( like DUI Courts ) , promote prosecutor training , and establish community standards of expectations in addressing the impaired driving violator . Strategies and Promising Practices There are many other resources and partnerships that have been successful . For example : (cid:144) Traffic Safety Resource Prosecutors ( TSRP ) ⎯ A NHTSA priority . ⎯ As of 2006 , there are 25 TSRPs . ⎯ The best TSRPs train and work with law enforcement officers and prosecutors . (cid:144) Fatal Crash Teams ( FACT teams go by different names in different jurisdictions ) ⎯ Traffic homicide detectives and prosecutors respond as a team to all felony fatal crashes . ⎯ King County , Washington , and many Indiana jurisdictions employ FACT teams . (cid:144) Major Accident Investigation Team ( MAIT ) ⎯ A collaboration between the Washington State Patrol and the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) . ⎯ The agencies jointly investigate all fatality crashes where three or more people are killed . (cid:144) “24 / 7” on - call prosecutors ( general and special - ized ) ⎯ Miami - Dade County , Florida State Attorney’s Office provides “around - the - clock” legal assistance to law enforcement officers and others . CRIMINAL JUSTICE COLLABORATION 12 ⎯ The Harris County ( Texas ) District Attorney’s Office also provides around - the - clock prosecutors . (cid:144) Tele - warrant partnerships between law enforce - ment , prosecutors , and judges . ⎯ Arizona prosecutors , law enforcement officers , and judges established a system to allow officers to quickly and easily obtain warrants to draw blood in DUI cases . (cid:144) In some jurisdictions , prosecutors and toxi - cologists attend and participate in law enforcement trainings and sobriety checkpoints and do ride - a - longs . In many of these jurisdictions , law enforcement officers , in turn , participate in prosecutor trainings ( see Appendix C for a listing of potential partners ) . System Wide Collaborations (cid:144) Strategic Highway Safety Planning Strategic Highway Safety Plans ( SHSP ) should be regularly reviewed and updated . The American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials ( AASHTO ) has encouraged all state Departments of Transportation ( DOTs ) to engage their state highway safety offices and their state and local law enforcement in the development of the SHSP . If law enforcement executives from all levels were not involved in the original development of their state’s SHSP , they should contact their DOT and urge they be involved in any review / update process that takes place . (cid:144) Florida’s Statewide Technical Advisory Com - mittee on DUI Enforcement and Prosecution ( TAC ) Florida’s diverse TAC demonstrates how a system - wide collaboration can achieve tremendous change . In 1994 , several stakeholders , led by the Institute of Police Technology and Management ( IPTM ) and the Florida Department of Transportation , created the Technical Review Committee to promote the use of laser speed - measuring devices in the state . The organizers welcomed law enforce - ment officers and prosecutors to the group . The task force was so effective that members expanded the committee’s scope to include all traffic issues and invited other stakeholders “to the table , ” including representatives from the state agency regulating breath testing ( the Florida Department of Law Enforcement ) , MADD , toxicologists , and judges . They renamed the Committee the Technical Advisory Committee on DUI Enforcement and Prosecution ( TAC ) . During the ensuing years , TAC created several subcommittees , including DUI Case Preparation , In - Car Video , Sobriety Checkpoints , DUI Law Update , Breath Testing , Legislative , Youth & Alcohol , and Bureau of Administrative Review and expanded to almost 30 members . The committee coordinates activities statewide by : (cid:144) Identifying new problems and solutions ; (cid:144) Developing new legislation ; (cid:144) Monitoring case development ; and (cid:144) Promoting education and enforcement waves . The committee has published manuals on case preparation and testimony , coordinated responses on all major legal challenges , and addressed numer - ous legislative issues . Association Collaborations Associations and other advocacy organizations that support improving highway safety initiatives , including reducing the incidences of driving while impaired ( e . g . , AAMVA , GHSA , and AAA ) . Community Collaborations (cid:144) Chamber of Commerce They clearly have a stake in a safe community : highway safety is good for business and tourism This Washington State Patrol ( WSP ) Mobile Impaired Driving Unit ( MIDU ) was purchased and equipped through a collaborative partnership between the WSP , Washington State Traffic Safety Commission ; Poulsbo RV ; State Farm Insurance ; and several other companies that provided equipment or other services . The MIDU is equipped with three BAC Compact Data Masters ; a dark room for DRE Evaluations ; three computer work stations for officers to prepare their reports ; and two prisoner holding cells .

Solicit and encourage their active partner - ship . (cid:144) Community Improvement Districts ( CIDs ) / Business Improvement Districts ( BIDS ) These private authorities are comprised of groups of property owners committed to business growth through improved quality of life issues . They have a direct interest in the safety of the community . (cid:144) Media To eliminate impaired driving , we must augment our enforcement efforts with education . In order to reach every driver with our message on the dangers and consequences of impaired driving , we must use as many resources as possible . One of the most valuable resources we have available to us is the media . Television , radio , and print media reach far more people than we can ever hope to reach through safety talks and presentations . This can have a tremendous impact on our citizens and encourage them to be responsible . Private Sector Collaborations Strong vocal support and active participation from various segments of the private sector are critical to achieving significant reductions in impaired driving and related crashes . We must actively seek their support and participation . Who are the stakeholders in the private sector ? Support should be sought from traditional and non - traditional partners , including : (cid:144) Advocacy Groups Advocacy groups , including state , regional , and local MADD affiliates . Don’t assume that every advocate is going to contact law enforcement ; they may be waiting for our invitation . (cid:144) Insurance Carriers In addition to corporate support , seek assistance of local agents who aggressively support highway safety issues within their coverage areas . Consider asking this group to assist with public information and education materials . (cid:144) Advertising Seek both responsible advertising and public information assistance from advertisers who are willing to promote safe driving . (cid:144) Automotive / Motorcycle Dealerships Encourage dealerships to sponsor safe driving campaigns , child safety seat clinics , and anti - impaired driving messages . (cid:144) Alcohol Beverage Industry We must bring them to the table , seek their input , and help find solutions collaboratively , where possible . All levels of this industry should be involved , including the distillers , brewers , distributors , proprietors , and servers . RECOMMENDATIONS An identified highway safety champion must call the first meeting and serve as a catalyst . The Subcommittee recommends that stakeholders employ the following tactics and strategies : CRIMINAL JUSTICE COLLABORATION 14 Photo courtesy of Rowan County , North Carolina , Sheriff’s Office (cid:144) Promote traffic law enforcement as a version of the “Broken Windows” theory . ⎯ Traffic law enforcement increases overall criminal interdiction and reduces overall crime rights via general deterrence . (cid:131) DUI (cid:131) Drug trafficking (cid:131) Burglary (cid:131) Gun possession (cid:131) Identity theft (cid:131) Terrorism interdiction ⎯ Develop a catch name / phrase . (cid:131) For example , “Traffic with a purpose . ” (cid:144) Promote deterrence through proven programs , including : ⎯ Sobriety checkpoints ⎯ Saturation patrols ⎯ Roving patrols ⎯ Public education combined with enforce - ment ⎯ Expansion of state Drug Recognition Expert ( DRE ) Programs ⎯ “Keg - buster” and other underage drinking education and enforcement programs (cid:144) Create state and local multi - disciplinary TACs that meet regularly and address current and emerging issues . (cid:144) Provide multi - disciplinary training that provides continuing education credits , whenever possible . (cid:144) Online / electronic multi - disciplinary training that provides continuing education credits , whenever possible . (cid:144) Create listserves or Yahoo groups . ⎯ Systems that allow for the quick , efficient , and free sharing of information . (cid:144) Support proven prevention efforts . ⎯ Prevention is preferable to punishment . It’s better to prevent a fatality than prosecute the person responsible for it . (cid:144) Support treatment and rehabilitation . ⎯ Engage treatment professionals . ⎯ Work with dedicated DUI / DWI courts . (cid:144) Support brief screening and intervention efforts . ⎯ Physicians and other medical professionals who are likely to encounter impaired people ( especially emergency room employees ) should screen them for alcohol and / or drug problems and offer assistance . (cid:131) Research demonstrates that the majority of injuries requiring emergency treatment are alcohol - and / or drug - related . (cid:144) Include multiple disciplines in major crash investigations , including law enforcement , prosecutors , hospitals ( to ensure that proper samples are obtained for testing purposes ) , toxicologists , medical examiners , state data system recorders ( to improve Fatal Analysis Reporting System [ FARS ] data ) , and others . (cid:144) Encourage prosecutors to include arresting officers and victims in their plea negotiations . ⎯ When prosecutors include law enforcement officers or victims , it makes them feel like their opinions matter and improves relation - ships . ⎯ Encourage prosecutors to aggressively enforce impaired driving laws . ⎯ Promote a policy of not reducing charges of people who provide admissible samples registering 0 . 08 or above . (cid:144) Promote court monitoring . ⎯ Court monitoring helps improve criminal justice proceedings . ⎯ When the system does not work properly ( and change is not being discussed ) , law enforcement officers understandably be - come frustrated and enforcement collapses . ⎯ The goals of court monitoring are : (cid:131) To compile statistics on how DUI cases are adjudicated . (cid:131) To make those involved in the process aware there is public interest in the outcome of such cases . (cid:131) To report compiled data to relevant entities so the system can be improved . (cid:144) Engage minority leaders . ⎯ Seek their assistance in informing their constituents about pending checkpoints , mobilizations , and crackdowns . CRIMINAL JUSTICE COLLABORATION 15 ⎯ Work with them on defined problems and find information - driven solutions to the problems . ⎯ Develop a strategy that focuses on outreach to minority youth to reduce underage drinking . (cid:131) Increases trust and communication between law enforcement and youth ) . ⎯ As much as possible , law enforcement should work with non - profits , businesses , churches , and other organizations to provide public safety education and presentations to members of the com - munity . (cid:131) Builds better community relationships . (cid:131) Encourages positive traffic safety behavior . ⎯ Use statistics more effectively to build relationships . (cid:131) Develops and provides accurate , timely information about criminal traffic behavior and collision trends to officers , allowing them to act on data , not race . (cid:131) Communicates to the community that police profile behavior , not race . ⎯ Work with local minority organizations for recruitment of officers from the minority communities . (cid:131) Law enforcement must focus on recruiting officers who reflect the diversity of the communities they serve . Lasting partnerships and collaborations are a proven method for sharing resources , acquiring needed assistance , and streamlining processes and important mechanisms for generating new ideas and innovative ways to use resources more efficiently . HURDLES TO REFORM America will have the DUI problem it chooses to have . We know how to solve the problem , but face numerous obstacles . There has been a lack of unified leadership and resolve . Public and private partnerships can resolve this deficiency . IACP , MADD , and NHTSA can and will fill the leadership void by engaging other stakeholders and working together to overcome the hurdles we face . Some of the challenges we must overcome include : (cid:144) Years of insufficient resources . (cid:144) Differing leadership priorities by jurisdiction . (cid:144) Differing needs of urban and rural jurisdictions . (cid:144) Poorly written , loophole - ridden , or unenforceable laws . (cid:144) A judiciary that struggles to define itself and maintain its objectivity in the face of aggressive defense attorneys . (cid:144) An organized DUI defense bar more concerned with “winning a case” than with the carnage on our streets and highways . (cid:144) Appellate court decisions that hinder impaired driving enforcement . Each state and jurisdiction needs to actively identify what their hurdles to success are , develop the necessary plans to address them , establish the partnerships necessary to overcome them , implement the plans , regularly examine the results ( and revise the process as required ) , and repeat the process . (cid:144) Law enforcement agencies should share best practices and resources with each other to promote consistency and to enhance working relationships . (cid:144) Inter - disciplinary partnerships can break traditional boundaries , provide broad - based support , amplify available resources , and establish shared ownership . (cid:144) Examples of inter - disciplinary partner - ships include collaboration between law enforcement and prosecutors , community organizations , and business leaders . (cid:144) Toxicologists should collaborate by sharing knowledge , addressing compli - cated issues , and further developing expertise . (cid:144) System - wide collaborations can create other opportunities , such as Strategic Highway Safety Planning efforts . Summing it up… COMMUNICATION 16 INTERNAL COMMUNICATION How do we sell DUI enforcement to our officers and the public ? As with any good product , it largely sells itself if the target audience is made aware of it . Garnering the support and response of officers and the public requires leadership , which begins with awareness and commitment at the highest level of any organization . Motivating road officers to not only accept , but also become actively involved with DUI enforcement , should be one of the focal points of a progressive traffic enforcement program . This motivation begins with the chief , sheriff , or other department head and must be conveyed from the top down throughout all levels of the organization . Training (cid:144) Officer apathy can be a concern when trying to promote DUI enforcement . This apathy can result from a lack of training , so it is essential that all officers receive the most current training available in DUI and other traffic enforcement techniques , including standardized field sobriety testing ( SFST ) . (cid:144) It seems that many officers fear ridicule if they incorrectly enforce traffic laws . Training that improves their professional competence is a motivational force for most . (cid:144) Internal train - the - trainer programs can be a very effective means to promote traffic enforcement training , as officers often better accept and implement training that is provided by trainers that they know . The Value of Statistics (cid:144) Provide officers and the public with statistics on DUI collisions , including the number of deaths , medical expenses , and property damage involving impaired drivers . Such statistics are readily available from a variety of sources , including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) , state governors’ traffic safety offices , and MADD . See , for example , www . nhtsa . gov , www . stopimpaireddriving . org , www - nrd . nhtsa . dot . gov / departments / nrd - 30 / ncsa / , www . ghsa . org , www . madd . org . (cid:144) In addition to being used to educate officers and the public , data should be used as part of any management accountability model to ensure resources are used in the right place and at the right time to interdict impaired driving before crashes occur . (cid:144) Law enforcement executives who seek public support for their enforcement efforts may also compile local statistics of the cost in life and property to their community . When citizens are made aware of the personal costs to them in human life and injury , along with monetary loss through medical expenses and property damage , they are likely to support your efforts . (cid:144) Even if citizens are not directly involved in a DUI crash , they are affected by an increase in their medical costs and vehicle insurance rates . These statistics are the foundation of support for both law enforcement officers and the public they serve . EXTERNAL MESSAGING Working with the public is a must in DUI enforcement . Law enforcement executives should not be deterred by the occasional negative public response to impaired driving enforcement . A consensus of the vast body of research on public attitudes continues to show that the public rates impaired driving among the greatest highway safety threats and there is broad - based support for enhanced enforcement . DUI enforcement pro - grams are greatly enhanced when an agency is proactive in garnering support for its efforts from key supporters and allies such as MADD and other traffic safety organizations , community groups , and coalitions . Public Relations (cid:144) A key component to an effective DUI enforce - ment campaign is proactive public relations . Civic and community groups are often eager to have police officers and executives make presentations on traffic and crash - related topics . These opportunities are invaluable in securing a broad base of community support , not only for the traffic and DUI enforcement programs , but for the agency in general . (cid:144) These presentations should focus not only on safe driving behaviors and the importance of driving sober , but should also emphasize the enforcement effort . Public perception that strict enforcement is occurring is one of the most effective means of reducing driver behaviors that contribute to traffic crashes . (cid:144) Recent analysis and study of traffic safety campaigns has demonstrated that clear and concise messages about strict enforcement are more effective at eliciting the desired public compliance than are messages about the inherent safety benefits of that compliance . When combined with actual high visibility enforcement , these messages have a synergistic COMMUNICATION 17 impact on public behavior well beyond that of the actual enforcement effort . Nowhere has that been more clearly demonstrated as with the “Click It or Ticket” occupant restraint campaign . (cid:144) These experiences suggest that deterring impaired driving may be best accomplished when messages focus on the likelihood of arrest , prosecution , and penal implications , rather than on injury or loss of life . Police executives should publicly convey their commitment to strict enforcement of impaired driving to raise the public perception that those who drive while impaired will be caught and punished . This commitment cannot be overstated so long as it is supported by actual enforcement efforts , and publicizing the results of those efforts serves to publicly reinforce that message . Marketing / Branding An effective marketing and branding strategy is crucial in any program devoted to reducing impaired driving . An example is the “Click It or Ticket” campaign . This statement and accompany - ing exposure heightened the awareness of the public concerning the importance of wearing seat belts . A successful campaign must reinforce the impaired driving reduction strategy and be well structured . Law enforcement executives should strongly consider partnering with their Governor’s Highway Safety Office in their efforts to “get the message out . ” NHTSA also encourages the use of their new impaired driving tag line : “Drunk Driving . Over the Limit . Under Arrest . ” COMMUNICATING WITH DIVERSE AUDIENCES While alcohol and drug use has been shown to vary widely with ethnic and cultural demographics , ethnic or cultural sensitivities should not be impediments to effective impaired driving enforce - ment . Impaired driving is an equal opportunity killer that causes the same pain and grief in families and communities of all ethnicities . This should be the motivation for law enforcement leaders to institute highly visible enforcement programs in all communi - ties . Open and Effective Communications (cid:144) As with all traffic enforcement programs , the success of impaired driving enforcement programs in diverse communities hinges upon the openness and effectiveness of communi - cation between law enforcement and the community . The community at large should be made aware that the enforcement effort is not intended to threaten them , but to protect them . This can often be achieved by involving community leaders in the planning process , the focusing of the enforcement efforts , and by providing feedback regarding the effectiveness of the program . (cid:144) Agencies that have open and positive relationships with their communities should utilize these existing relationships to promote its enforcement efforts . Agencies without such existing relationships will be well served in all their law enforcement efforts by establishing ties with key community leaders , and keeping lines of communication open with those leaders year round , not just in times of crisis or when it serves the department needs . (cid:144) Additionally , police – community relationships need not consist of people of the same ethnicity to be effective . It is the mutual interest and respect that bind such relationships , not racial or cultural homogeneity . THE ROLE OF THE GOVERNOR’S HIGHWAY SAFETY OFFICE Each state has a governor ' s highway safety representative and , in most cases , a statewide highway safety office ( SHSO ) , directed by a governor ' s representative that serves a coordinating role for programs , information , and funding . SHSOs are known by various titles state to state . The mission of these offices is to educate the public on traffic safety and to facilitate the implementation of programs that reduce crashes , injuries , and fatalities on the roadways . SHSOs are a great asset for impaired driving communications and media involvement , particularly for small - medium size local agencies that may not have professional staff dedicated to handling these functions . (cid:144) For example , SHSOs frequently hold media campaigns to promote both NHTSA and local safe driving campaigns , such as Click It or Ticket , where local law enforcement officials can serve as guest speakers . (cid:144) Most SHSOs have available , often at no charge , a variety of printed publications and media resources that are ready to be used by your jurisdiction . (cid:144) The SHSO is also the conduit of federal highway safety funding available from NHTSA , and many law enforcement agencies apply for and receive grants to assist them in combating COMMUNICATION 18 impaired driving . Such grants may provide funding for a variety of matters , depending on the funds available , the data - driven need of a given community , and the state ' s Strategic Highway Safety Plan . (cid:144) Another resource similar to the SHSO is the Governors Highway Safety Association ( GHSA ) , an umbrella organization representing the interests of the SHSOs and serving as the state’s voice on highway safety at the national level . This non - profit association represents the state and territorial highway safety offices that administer programs addressing the behavior of drivers and other road users , and one of its main focuses is impaired driving . GHSA ' s mission is to provide leadership in the development of national policy to ensure effective highway safety programs . The Association provides a collective voice for the states in working with Congress and the federal agencies to address their safety challenges . Additionally , the organization ' s Web page ( www . ghsa . org ) contains a variety of reports , state - by - state statutory comparisons , and other information to assist local law enforcement in its efforts to curb impaired driving . ENGAGING THE MEDIA Law enforcement agencies need the support of the public to provide effective police services for our communities . The local and national media are one of the most effective means to reach a broad audience quickly , so it is critical to develop ongoing working rela - tionships with them . Since everything we do is in the public domain , the most successful police executives take the mission of engaging the media seriously . This approach has a direct impact on everything they do and they ensure that the media is engaged at all levels . As stewards of their community’s safety and security , successful police executives treat each interview as an opportunity to disseminate their agency’s message clearly . With good preparation , solid messages , and knowledge of a few interview techniques , you can have a positive influence on the outcome of stories about your agency and law enforcement in general . Getting Ready Training to engage with the media is absolutely critical . Success in an interview is directly tied to the quality of the presentation , the ability to articulate your message , and the level of control exercised during the interview process . Don’t think an interview is a conversation or that you can “wing it . ” Instead , view it as an opportunity to make a well - developed presentation , reflecting research , preparation , and enthusiasm . Specialized media training can better ensure success in this endeavor . Messages Considerable thought should be given to what you want to say and how to say it . Anticipate the issues and questions of an interviewer and equip yourself with short , memorable , positive and relevant messages . Practice , practice , practice . Be aware of interview time constraints and the importance of optimizing every moment . Some interview situations will allow you to talk at length ; however , for most , it is critical to distill your message down to 12 - to - 15 second sound bites or one - to - two dozen quotable words . Because you have no control over what questions an interviewer will use in the final story , each of your answers should deliver a desired message . Tools Basic techniques you can use to control an interview and present your message : (cid:144) Hooking Take advantage of opportunities before and during the interview to “hook” your interviewer . Suggest topics , entice the reporter into your agenda , and focus on your messages . (cid:144) Bridging The smooth transition from the interviewer’s question to your message . A direct question deserves a direct answer . Then , after briefly touch - ing upon the answer , bridge to your message and your agenda . (cid:144) Flagging A way to underscore , verbally and non - verbally , what is important within your answers during the course of an interview . You can use voice inflection , a hand gesture , eye contact , body language , or a phrase like , “What is really critical to know about this issue is…” to ensure the interviewer and the COMMUNICATION 19 audience have a clear understanding of what you think is important . (cid:144) Personal Credibility Remember , you’re the expert , that’s why you’re being interviewed . Use your personal knowledge and experience for emphasis and avoid speaking about police services in the abstract . ⎯ For example , if you can say , “I’ve been a patrol officer” or “I’ve talked to the men and women using this community policing technique , ” say it . Your critics aren’t shy about their credentials ; you shouldn’t be either . Repeating Messages An interview has a purpose and so should you . Know what you want the headline or main message to be . During an interview , repeat your message frequently . In an audio or video taped interview , you rarely know in advance which of your statements will be used in the final edit of the broadcast story . Repetition helps to ensure the audience and the media remember your messages . Rules of Engagement (cid:144) The Interviewer and the Audience Prior to any interview , find out as much as you can about your interviewer and your audience . Don’t confuse the two—the former is only a conduit to the latter . Tailor your messages accordingly . (cid:144) The Record Always consider yourself “on the record” and never say anything you don’t want to see in print or broadcast . However , should you decide to say something “on background” or even “off the record , ” clearly indicate the rules for that portion of the interview before you put on a microphone and be sure the interviewer agrees you are “on background” or “off the record” first . Otherwise , you are still “on the record . ” (cid:144) Language Remember to avoid police jargon , acronyms , and technical terms . If you need to use a law enforcement term , be sure to define it . Every member of your audience should understand your message . (cid:144) Arguments The old saying goes : “You won’t win an argument with someone who buys ink by the barrel , or videotape by the case , ” so don’t argue . By the same token , there may be times when an interviewer is confrontational , and you may need to “step up” to the situation to maintain control of the interview . Never let yourself become a passive participant in the interview process . (cid:144) Protect the Record Your credibility as a law enforcement executive depends on it , because “a lie unchallenged becomes the truth . ” Bad information has a way of propagating and taking on a life of its own , unless challenged . If an interviewer asks you a question based on false data , be sure to protect and correct the record . Be careful not to repeat the false data yourself and to avoid any negative or emotionally charged statements . Don’t let a damaging story gather credibility or extra weight by letting the falsehood come from your own lips . (cid:144) Honesty Always answer honestly , but never say , “No comment . ” If you don’t know the answer to a question , if the answer is classified , invades someone’s privacy , or would compromise an ongoing investigation , it’s ok to say so . Answer honestly and , in doing so , bridge to one of your prepared messages . Communication : A Vital Mission Remember , communication is a crucial part of every officer’s job and is even more critical for police executives . It’s the only way law enforcement can develop the public support needed to perform its public functions effectively . Every media encounter is a valuable opportunity to convey who we are , what we do , and what we need to do—the job our community expects of us . Formal training in communications and working the media is available from a variety of sources , including colleges and universities . The investment in formal training can pay substantial dividends in terms of effective representation of your agency , its officers , and its programs . In addition , a Public Information Officer course directed specifically at traffic programs is available from the NHTSA . Interested parties should inquire with their regional NHTSA office . MAINTAINING ONGOING MEDIA RELATIONSHIPS It is essential that law enforcement organizations take the time to develop long - term relationships with their media . As with any worthwhile relationship , building a long - term relationship with the media takes a great deal of time and effort to both develop and sustain . Unless the relationship is mutually beneficial for all involved , it will fail . One key factor in ensuring that the relationship is mutually beneficial is to understand each other’s needs . Needs of the Media “ Filling the Sausage Casing , ” “ Feeding the Beast , ” or “ Formatting the Rundown ” are terms used by news producers to describe the daily task of filling COMMUNICATION 20 pre - determined time slots with information for their viewers , listeners , or readers . Although the news of the day continually changes , the time segments allotted to report the stories remain the same . We need to remind ourselves that we are just one of the many organizations that are competing for media attention on a daily basis . Therefore , it is essential that we cater to the needs of the media by ensuring that our information is both timely and newsworthy . Understanding the Media’s Timelines – “Being Ready to Pounce” As everyone knows , drinking and driving tragedies occur on our streets and highways every day across North America . Unfortunately , these daily tragedies have become so commonplace that the public and the media routinely let the stories of seriously or fatally injured victims of impaired driving crashes go by with little or no recognition . The vast majority of media outlets work on their stories on a day - to - day basis . Therefore , it is essential that agencies not miss out on opportunities to speak out about these tragedies when they occur . When a tragedy takes place , media outlets will need to speak to a spokesperson immediately , not tomorrow . If the goal is to keep your message alive all year round , then it is essential that we have a game plan in place to deal with these potential “opportunities” when they become available . Potential spokes - persons must be ready to go with prepared messages . Although the time , location , and victims change from crash to crash , the “Don’t Drink and Drive” message remains the same . Thinking Outside of the Podium – Customizing the News Conference Media reporters require three main ingredients to tell any story— images , sound , and people . Holding a news conference in a sterile media gallery may be easy to organize , but it may not get the media coverage desired . Our organizations must be willing to think creatively if we truly want to obtain coverage . Visiting a crash scene on an anniversary date , having a family member ( if they are willing ) and / or the investigating officer present to speak with the media , or hosting a news conference at a local school to launch a “Safe Grad” initiative are just a few examples of different ways to present a story . Call Ahead There are several ways to notify the media about a news conference or other event , including a phone call , email , fax , and / or media advisory ( a one - page document that includes the who , what , when , where , and why of the event ) . Consider using several means of contact , since the media are so busy and are tracking so many stories simultaneously . After sending out the media advisory , someone with media experience should contact each media outlet to ensure they have received the invitation and to provide a ten - second pitch about why they should cover the story . This is also an excellent opportunity to advise them of the importance of the event being covered and / or what extra steps have been taken to make their jobs easier ( e . g . , spokespersons being made available , visuals , statistics being made available , etc . ) . Placing the Story On the day of an event or announcement , a news release may be needed to make the media’s job easier . Part of good media relations is understanding how the media requires information to be sent to them . The news release should be timed for distribution to all media and available online at the same time as the announcement . For those media that do not attend , you can send them the news release and available press kit , with all the necessary story elements , and follow up by phone to make sure they understand the significance of the news and how it fits in the big picture , aka , “why they should care . ” Impaired Driving Law Enforcement Message The following is a list of some of the traditional events that can be used to keep the impaired driving law enforcement message alive all year round : (cid:144) Super Bowl Sunday (cid:144) St . Valentine’s Day ( What says “love” more than being a Designated Driver ? ) (cid:144) St . Patrick’s Day (cid:144) Memorial Day and other holiday weekends (cid:144) Halloween (cid:144) Cultural events in your city where alcohol is involved ( e . g . , Octoberfest ) (cid:144) Athletic Event Tailgate Parties—Set up “spot checks” in immediate area and let them know ahead of time (cid:144) “Safe Grad” (cid:144) Red Ribbon Campaigns in November / December (cid:144) Anniversary dates—especially in local high pro - file cases (cid:144) Auto Shows / Classic Car Shows—Set up drinking / driving information booths Each year , someone dies in an alcohol - related motor vehicle crash every 31 minutes and someone is injured every two minutes . Source : NHTSA 2005 COMMUNICATION 21 Many traffic safety partners , including MADD and NHTSA regional offices , provide template media materials that can be valuable to law enforcement . INTERNET RESOURCES Internet technology has brought an unprece - dented amount of information to the fingertips . Information that not long ago required a staff to research , decipher , and maintain can now be had by anyone with minimal effort . Access to information to communicate your missions and programs to your officers and the public alike is just a few mouse clicks away . While Internet searches can provide volumes of information to assist you in your communications efforts , key Web sites have been designed specifically for this purpose . Appendix B of this document includes a list of Internet sites that provide valuable statistics , training , and other materials to assist law enforcement in developing a comprehensive and effective impaired driving enforcement program . (cid:144) Use communications strategies year - round to publicize law enforcement priorities , develop public support , and publicize enforcement activities . (cid:144) Use clear and concise messages about strict impaired driving enforce - ment . (cid:144) Combine publicity with actual high visibility enforcement to create a synergistic effect . (cid:144) Increase publicity by seeking earned media coverage before , during , and after law enforcement operations ( to announce them , increase their visibility , and publicize the results ) . (cid:144) Develop long - term relationships with the media . Summing it up… CONCLUSION 22 We know how to solve the impaired driving problem . The question is , do we have the resolve to do so ? With the necessary resolve and by applying the leadership , partnerships and communications strategies outlined herein , law enforcement can be a significant part of the solution . The fact is , North America will have the impaired driving problem it chooses to have . We cannot accept the moderate gains we have achieved during the past several years . We must do more , we must start now , and we must do so together . Toward this end , it is the sincere hope of the Impaired Driving Subcommittee that law enforcement executives utilize the IACP Resolution ( calling for a Renewed Effort to Eliminate Impaired Driving ) and this Guidebook as source documents in strategic planning and efforts to eliminate impaired driving .
