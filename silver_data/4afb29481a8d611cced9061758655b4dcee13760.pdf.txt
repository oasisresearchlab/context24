E - mail : inoue - ma2 @ mc . pref . osaka . jp . Intestinal epithelial cells possess apical - basal polarity , which governs the exchange of nutrients and waste . Perturbation of cell polarity appears to be a general feature of cancers , although most colorectal cancers are differentiated adenocarcinomas , in which polarity is maintained to some extent . Little is known about the role of dysregulated polarity in cancer . The cancer tissue e originated spheroid method was applied to the preparation and culture of spheroids . Spheroids were cultured in suspension or in type I collagen gel . Polarity was assessed by IHC of apical markers and electron microscopy . Two types of polarity status in spheroids were observed : apical - in , with apical membrane located at cavities inside the spheroids in type I collagen gel ; and apical - out , with apical membrane located at the outermost layer of spheroids in suspension . These polarities were highly interchangeable . Inhibitors of Src and dynamin attenuated the polarity switch . In patients , clusters of cancer cells that invaded vessels had both apical - in and apical - out morphologic features , whereas primary and metastatic tumors had apical - in features . In a mouse liver metastasis model , apical - out spheroids injected into the portal vein became apical - in spheroids in the liver within a few days . Inhibitors of Src and dynamin signi ﬁ cantly decreased liver metastasis . Polarity switching was observed in spheroids and human cancer . The polarity switch was critical in an experimental liver metastasis model . ( Am J Pathol 2016 , 186 : 1 e 13 ; http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . ajpath . 2015 . 12 . 011 ) Intestinal Q5 epithelial cells are organized into adherent groups of cells that separate and protect the organism from the external environment . A closed epithelium regulates the exchange of nutrients and waste between the internal and external envi - ronments . The direction of the exchange is determined by the epithelial cells ’ apical - basal polarity . The molecular mecha - nism of forming cell polarity is based on evolutionarily conserved partition - defective ( PAR ) / atypical protein kinase C ( aPKC ) system . 1 , 2 Asymmetrically localized components of the PAR - aPKC system are linked with other cellular machinery , such as junctional structure formation and actin polymerization . The perturbation of cell polarity is a general feature in cancer . It is becoming evident that Par proteins are directly involved in the loss of cell and tissue architecture in carcinoma . 3 , 4 For example , the loss of Par3 is directly linked to tumor invasion and metastasis in breast cancer . 5 , 6 Because > 90 % of colorectal cancers ( CRCs ) are differ - entiated adenocarcinoma , polarity in most CRCs is disor - ganized but not completely lost . For most histologic types of CRC , the pathologic grades are independent of disease progression ; even differentiated CRCs have malignant features . 7 The status and role of disorganized polarity in Supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Q1 Grant - in - Aid for Scienti ﬁ c Research ( C ) Q2 26430138 ( H .

A CTOS is a spheroid that consists of pure cancer cells ; it retains characteristics of original tumors and mouse xenograft tumors in vitro , particularly the formation of gland - like structures . It has been widely accepted that metastasis originates from a single cell . In theory , multiple distinct steps are involved : a cancer cell detaches from the original tumor , migrates to the blood or lymphatic vessels , penetrates the lumen , circulates to distant organs , attaches to the vessels of distant organs , invades into the parenchyma , and ﬁ nally forms tumors . 13 However , it was recently proposed that cancer cells that originate from solid tumors migrate not only as single cells but also as cell clusters in a process referred to as collective migration . 14 Clusters that maintain E - cadherin e based adhesions migrate in Matrigel synthetic matrix in vitro . 5 In clinical pathology , microvascular inva - sion in a solid tumor is diagnosed as a tumor mass surrounded by blood or lymphatic vessels . Microvascular invasion correlates strongly with the risk of metastasis . 15 In addition , circulating tumor clusters in the bloodstream of patients with breast cancer have been linked with disease progression . 16 Thus , clusters of cancer cells may also be an origin of metastasis . We found that a dynamic change of polarity status occurs in CRC CTOS in vitro and in vivo . We also investigated the role of polarity in the metastasis of CTOS as clusters of cancer cells . Materials and Methods Ethics Statement The institutional ethics committees at the Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases ( OMCCCD ) approved this study . CRC specimens were collected from patients treated at the Department of Surgery , OMCCCD . Animal studies were approved by the OMCCCD Institu - tional Animal Care and Use Committee and performed in compliance with the institutional guidelines . Isolation and Culture of CTOS from Xenograft and Primary Tumors Primary cultures of human CRC cells were prepared ac - cording to the CTOS method . 10 Brie ﬂ y , surgically resected tumor samples or xenograft tumors were mechanically dissociated , partially digested with liberase DH ( Roche , Mannheim , Germany ) , and ﬁ ltered through cell strainers . Cell clusters were collected on 100 - m m or 40 - m m cell strainers ( BD Falcon , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) . CTOSs were cultured in StemPro hESC ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . Institutional pathologists examined the colorectal tumors . CTOSs in gel were embedded in CellMatrix I - A ( Nitta Gelatin , Osaka , Japan ) on 35 - mm dishes and cultured in StemPro medium . CTOS in suspension were cultured with the CTOS method in noncoated 10 - cm dishes in StemPro medium . Immunostaining CTOSs in suspension were ﬁ xed for 5 minutes with 10 % formalin , embedded in CellMatrix I - A ( Nitta Gelatin ) to condense the CTOSs and ﬁ xed for 1 additional hour . CTOSs in gel were also ﬁ xed for 1 hour . Next , gel droplets that contained CTOSs were stained with Sirius red to facilitate further manipulation . Then , the gel was embedded in paraf ﬁ n . The paraf ﬁ n blocks were cut into 4 - m m sections and subjected to immunostaining . Immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) was performed as previously described . 10 The following primary antibodies were used : E - cadherin ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) , PARD3 ( Sigma - Aldrich , St Louis , MO ) , D2 - 40 ( Nichirei Biosciences , Tokyo , Japan ) , CD31 ( Dako , Glostrup , Denmark ) , villin and cleaved caspase - 3 ( Cell Signaling Technology , Danvers , MA ) , and ezrin and ZO - 1 ( Invitrogen ) . LMO7 was a gift from Dr . Jun Miyoshi ( OMCCCD , Osaka , Japan ) . For whole - mount staining of CTOSs , the CTOSs in gel were extracted by digesting the gel with 2 mg / mL of collagenase IV ( Worthington Biochemical Corporation , Lakewood , NJ ) for 10 minutes . The extracted CTOSs in gel or in suspension were ﬁ xed and permealized with 4 % paraformaldehyde / phosphate - buffered saline containing 1 % Triton X - 100 at 4 (cid:2) C for 1 hour . After blocking with 5 % bovine serum albumin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 1 hour , CTOSs were incubated with anti e E - cadherin antibody ( BD Biosciences ) overnight at 4 (cid:2) C . Next , they were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa - 488 or Alexa - 555 ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) or Rhodamine Phalloidin with Hoechst33342 ( Life Technologies ) overnight . Cells were mounted with Flu - orSave Reagent ( Calbiochem , San Diego , CA ) . Fluorescence images were obtained using confocal microscopy ( Leica Microsystems , Wetzlar , Germany ) . Quantitative Analysis of Polarity Status The CTOSs were immunostained with villin . The polarity status of the CTOSs was classi ﬁ ed into 4 groups : apical - out ( apical proteins located only at the outermost membrane of a CTOS ) , apical - in ( apical proteins located only at multiple lumens inside a CTOS ) , mixed ( apical proteins located both at the outermost membrane and at multiple lumens inside a CTOS ) , and none ( apical proteins not detected ) . Multiple CTOSs were analyzed and categorized , and the proportion of each polarity status was calculated .

Cell Death Assay Apoptosis was detected by cleaved caspase - 3 staining . The rate of apoptosis in each CTOS or liver focus of cancer cells was calculated by dividing all the nuclei that stained posi - tive for cleaved caspase - 3 by the total number of DAPI - stained nuclei . Multiple CTOSs or liver foci were analyzed and subjected to statistical analysis . Electron Microscopy CTOSs cultured in suspension and type I collagen gel were ﬁ xed with a cacodylate - buffered solution ( 0 . 15 mol / L Q6 , pH 7 . 4 ) that contained freshly prepared 2 % paraformaldehyde , 2 % glutaraldehyde , and 2 mmol / L CaCl 2 at room temperature for 12 hours . CTOSs were post ﬁ xed with 1 . 0 % OsO 4 in cacody - late buffer ( 0 . 15 mol / L , pH 7 . 4 ) that contained 2 mmol / L CaCl 2 for 90 minutes at 4 (cid:2) C . The following electron micro - scopic procedures were performed as previously described . 17 RNA Interference Experiments The Src - speci ﬁ c RNA interference ( RNAi ) and control RNAi were from the siGENOME Human siRNA - SMART pool ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c Dharmacon , Lafayette , CO ) . C45 - 2D cells were established from the C45 CTOS line . Brie ﬂ y , C45 CTOS were cultured on a type I collagen ( Cellmatrix I - C , Nitta Gelatin ) e coated dish with DMEM / F12 ( Invi - trogen ) and 10 % fetal bovine serum . The CTOSs that grew on the dish were passaged once each week . After several passages , C45 - 2D cells were established . RNAi was trans - fected to C45 - 2D cells by lipofection using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX ( Life Technologies ) . Quantitative RT - PCR Total RNA was extracted from CTOSs or the HT29 cell line using Trizol ( Invitrogen ) . The RT - PCR reactions were performed with 1 m g of total RNA using Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) . The primers for PCR were as follows 18 , 19 : FYN - forward , 5 0 - TGTGACCTCCA - TCCCCAACT - 3 0 ; FYN - reverse , 5 0 - AACTCAGGTCATC - TTCTGTCCGT - 3 0 ; LYN - forward , 5 0 - GAGGCTCTACG - CTGTGGTCA - 3 0 ; LYN - reverse , 5 0 - GACTCGGAGACCA - GAACATTAGC - 3 0 ; SRC - forward , 5 0 - CAGTGTCTGACT - TCGACAACGC - 3 0 ; SRC - reverse , 5 0 - CCATCGGCGTGT - TTGGAGTA - 3 0 ; YES - forward , 5 0 - GCTGCACTGTATGG - TCGGTT - 3 0 ; YES - reverse , 5 0 - AGGGCACGGCATCCTG - TATC - 3 0 ; DNM2 - forward , 5 0 - ACACGGAGCAGAGAA - ACGTCTACA - 3 0 ; DNM2 - reverse , 5 0 - GGTGCATGATG - GTCTTTGGCATGA - 3 0 ; 18s rRNA - forward , 5 0 - AAAC - GGCTACCACATCCAAG - 3 0 ; and 18s rRNA - reverse , 5 0 - CCTCCAATGGATCCTCGTTA - 3 0 . The 18s rRNA expression was used as an internal control . For real - time PCR analysis , the mRNA expression of human SRC and DNM2 was quanti ﬁ ed using SYBR Green . Real - time PCR was performed in triplicate for each gene . Each SYBR Green assay was performed in a 10 - m L reaction volume , which included 5 m L of Fast SYBR Green master mix ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) with 200 nmol / L of each primer . Assays were performed on StepOne Real - Time PCR System ( Applied Biosystems ) under fast thermal cycling : 95 (cid:2) C for 20 seconds , followed by 40 cycles of 95 (cid:2) C for 3 seconds , and 60 (cid:2) C for 30 seconds , followed by melting curve analysis . Data were analyzed by the StepOne software version 2 . 1 ( Applied Biosystems ) . Fold difference of gene expression was determined by the DD CT method . Western Blots Western blotting was performed as previously described . 12 The CTOSs in gel were digested by 2 mg / mL of collagenase IV ( Worthington Biochemical Corporation ) for 10 minutes , rinsed , and lyzed in the same way as the CTOSs in suspension . Primary antibodies against the phospho - Src family ( Tyr416 ) and Src ( 36D10 ) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology . Luciferase Vector Construction and Gene Transfer To generate pPB / Luc , the BglII - EagI fragment , including a Luciferase gene , was transferred to the pPB - UBC / ires / Puro vector . 20 CTOSs were prepared from xenograft tumors origi - nated from C45 CTOSs . To prepare for electroporation , C45 CTOSs were pretreated with 5 mmol / L EDTA / phosphate - buffered saline for 30 minutes at room temperature , then mixed with pPB / Luc and the transposase expression vector pCMV - hyPBase . 20 Electroporation was performed in 2 - mm gap cuvettes at 150 V for 5 ms using a Type II NEPA21 electroporator ( Nepa Gene , Chiba , Japan ) . C45Luc CTOSs were established by puromycin selection . C45Luc CTOSs were subcutaneously inoculated into a NOD / SCID mouse to generate a xenograft tumor . C45 Luc CTOSs were prepared from the xenograft tumor and further selected by culture with puromycin . Then , C45Luc CTOSs were subjected to the in vivo liver metastasis model . Liver Metastasis Model with CTOSs The C45 CTOS line was used for liver metastasis model . 10 The C45Luc CTOSs ( 40 to 100 m m ) were collected into 1 . 5 - mL tubes ( 100 CTOSs per tube ) . With the mice under anesthesia , the CTOSs were injected into the portal vein of nude mice using a 30 - G needle . The volume of the vehicle was 300 m L . Mice were anesthetized by three types of mixed agents , including 0 . 3 mg / kg of medetomidine , 4 . 0 mg / kg of midazolam , and 5 . 0 mg / kg of butorphanol . The anesthetics were administered to male nude mice by i . p . injection . Four weeks later , mice were sacri ﬁ ced and livers were collected .

Bioluminescence was measured using the IVIS system ( Xenogen Corporation , Alameda , CA ) . The mice were sacri ﬁ ced immediately , livers were removed , and ex vivo imaging was performed using the same system . We visually counted the number of nodules on the surface of each liver . Next , the livers were ﬁ xed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin at 4 (cid:2) C for 3 hours . The livers were cut into 2 - mm sections , and all sections were placed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin again at 4 (cid:2) C overnight . After paraf ﬁ nization , the tissue samples were cut into 4 m m sections and subjected to IHC . Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism version 6 ( GraphPad Software , San Diego , CA ) . Data are expressed as means (cid:3) SD . Statistical signi ﬁ cance was tested using an unpaired t - test for single comparison and a one - way analysis of variance followed by Tukey ’ s test for multiple comparisons . P < 0 . 05 was considered statistically signi ﬁ cant . Results Polarity Status in CTOSs and Patient Tumors of CRC First , CTOSs can be stably cultured not only in type I collagen gel but also in suspension . 10 In contrast , a sus - pension culture of spheroids from normal crypt cells has not been reported . 21 When C45 CTOSs were cultured in sus - pension , the apical membrane detected by villin formed on the outside surface ( apical - out ) ( Figure 1 ½ F1 (cid:4) ½ F1 (cid:4) A ) . As previously reported , 10 when cultured in type I collagen gel , the formed Figure 1 Characteristics of polarity status in cancer tissue e originated spheroids ( CTOSs ) derived from a xenograft of human colorectal cancer .

This orientation was con ﬁ rmed by staining with multiple markers of the apical membrane , including villin , PARD3 , 22 LMO7 , 23 ZO - 1 , and phalloidin ( Figure 1B ) . Electron microscopic analysis revealed that microvilli were formed on the outside surface membrane of CTOSs cultured in suspension ( Figure 1C ) . Junctional structures , including tight junctions , adherens junctions , and desmo - somes , were observed between the outermost cells of CTOSs ( Figure 1 , D and E ) . No inside lumen with microvilli was observed in the CTOSs in suspension . In contrast , microvilli were not formed on the outside - surface mem - brane of CTOSs cultured in collagen gel ( Figure 1F ) . Instead , basement membrane e like structures were observed near the outside - surface membrane of the outermost cells . The surfaces of the small lumens inside CTOSs were covered by microvilli and sealed with junctional structures ( Figure 1 , G and H ) . We investigated whether these two types of polarity exist in CRC patient tumors . Although most cancer cell nests in differentiated adenocarcinoma were apical - in , both types of polarity were observed in regions of lymphovascular inva - sion ( Figure 2 ½ F2 (cid:4) ½ F2 (cid:4) ) . When a cluster of cancer cells occupied the entire lumen , its polarity status was mainly apical - in ( Figure 2 , A and B ) . However , when clusters inside the vessel lumen were apart from surrounding endothelial cells , the polarity status was mainly apical - out ( Figure 2 , A and B ) . The apical - out phenotype was also observed in a case of gastric cancer ( Supplemental Figure S1A ) . Dynamic Change of Polarity Status in CTOSs Next , we examined time courses of the change of polarity status . When the culture condition was changed , the polarity status changed from apical - out to apical - in within 8 to 18 hours and vice versa ( Figure 3 ½ F3 (cid:4) ½ F3 (cid:4) , A and B ) . The dynamic change of polarity status is referred to as polarity switching . We investigated various extracellular matrices ( ECMs ) as a trigger of polarity switching and found that type I collagen and Matrigel ( which mainly consists of type IV collagen and laminin ) potently induced polarity switching . None of the other matrices examined ( eg , ﬁ bronectin , vitronectin , hyal - uronic acid ) affected the polarity status ( Figure 3C ) . We also assessed the polarity status in 10 CTOS lines , including the C45 CTOS line , derived from nine patients . All 10 CTOS lines exhibited the apical - out phenotype in suspension ; however , six of 10 CTOS lines exhibited polarity switching ( Figure 3D ) . When we assessed polarity status in 15 primary CTOS tumors from 12 patients , we observed that all CTOSs exhibited the apical - out phenotype in suspension , and 10 of 15 CTOSs exhibited polarity switching ( Supplemental Figure S1B ) . Thus , polarity switching is a common phenomenon in CRC CTOS . On the other hand , established cell lines of CRC rarely adopt polarity . 8 , 9 We examined three relatively p r i n t & w eb 4 C = F P O Figure 2 Both apical - out and apical - in polarity statuses are observed in cancer cell clusters inside the vessels in patient ’ s colorectal cancers .

Spheroids composed of T84 cells exhibited partial apical - in type po - larity even in suspension ; this pattern was observed neither in CTOS lines nor in primary CTOS lines . To further investigate the characters of CTOSs in the none group , which lacked villin staining , we examined another apical marker , ezrin . Double staining of villin and ezrin in CTOSs revealed that these apical markers colocalized both in apical - in and apical - out CTOSs ( Supplemental Figure S2 , A and C ) . Cultured in gel , the percentage of CTOSs in the no villin group was almost the same with that in the no ezrin group ( Supplemental Figure S2 , B and E ) . In contrast , cultured in ﬂ oating conditions , most CTOSs in the none group had the apical - out pattern with ezrin staining ( Supplemental Figure S2 , D and E ) . Thus , the none group is not a simple group of lacking apical membrane but included different characters of apical membrane , especially in ﬂ oating conditions . Integrin and Its Downstream Signal in Polarity Switching Next , we investigated the molecular mechanism of polarity switching in CTOSs . Integrin b 1 is reportedly involved in polarity formation in Madin - Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cells and primary mammary epithelia . 27 , 28 We assessed the role of integrin b 1 in polarity switching . When treated with a neutralizing antibody of integrin b 1 , the polarity switch from apical - out to apical - in was partially inhibited Figure 3 Dynamic change of cell polarity sta - tus in cancer tissue e originated spheroids ( CTOSs ) from apical - out to apical - in .

We also assessed the role of downstream molecules of integrin b 1 signaling : integrin - linked kinase ( ILK ) , focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , and Src . 29 , 30 Admin - istration of an FAK inhibitor ( FAKII ) partially inhibited polarity switching ( Figure 4B ) . An ILK inhibitor ( Cpd22 ) inhibited polarity switching more prominently ( Figure 4B ) . The Src inhibitors PP1 and PP2 robustly inhibited polarity switching ( Figure 4B and Supplemental Figure S3 , A and B ) . Polarity switching was completely blocked by dasatinib ( Figure 4B and Supplemental Figure S3 , A and B ) , whereas imatinib had no effect ( Supplemental Figure S3 , A and B ) . A similar effect of dasatinib was observed in a primary CTOS , C241 ( Supplemental Figure S3C ) . Inhibition of Src Suppresses Polarity Switching We further examined Src in the phenomenon of polarity switching . We assessed the change in phosphorylation of the Src family kinase ( SFK ) by Western blotting in C45 CTOSs . Phosphorylation of SFK was observed in suspen - sion and transiently and marginally increased after cells were embedded in type I collagen gel ( Figure 4C ) . Both dasatinib and PP1 inhibited phosphorylation ( Figure 4D ) . Dasatinib inhibited even basal levels of phosphorylation in suspension . A similar effect of dasatinib was observed in the C97 CTOS line ( Supplemental Figure S3 , D and E ) . Next , we used siRNA methods to suppress SRC gene expression . Effective suppression of total SRC expression by siRNA marginally suppressed polarity switching ( Supplemental Figure S3 , F and G ) . Inhibition of Dynamin Suppresses Polarity Switching Dynamic microtubule changes and endocytosis are report - edly involved in the formation of cell polarity and lumen formation in normal epithelial cells . 31 Nocodazole and paclitaxel , inhibitors of microtubule reformation , each had a marginal effect on polarity switching ( Figure 4E ) . Dynamin ( DNM ) , a GTPase , regulates the endocytic traf ﬁ cking required during apical membrane removal . 31 The DNM in - hibitors MiTMAB and dynasore remarkably suppressed polarity switching ( Figure 4E ) . Next , we suppressed DNM2 Figure 4 Src family kinases ( SFKs ) and dyna - min regulate polarity switching in cancer tissue e originated spheroids ( CTOSs ) .

Suppression of DNM2 expression marginally suppressed polarity switching ( Supplemental Figure S3G ) . Polarity Switching in Vivo The tumor from which the C45 CTOS line originated was a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma . The gland - like structure in the original tumor was apical - in ( Supplemental Figure S4A ) . When it was prepared as a CTOS , the spheroid exhibited apical - out polarity in suspension ( Supplemental Figure S4A ) . When the CTOSs in suspension were s . c . injected into mice , the consequent tumors formed gland - like structures that had regained apical - in polarity ( Supplemental Figure S4A ) . Thus , polarity switching must happen in vivo during tumor formation . Next , we assessed the time course of polarity switching in vivo . To follow the fate of a single CTOS , we injected CTOSs into the mouse portal vein and examined the morphologic features of CTOSs implanted in the liver at each time point after injection . The CTOSs mostly remained apical - out at 1 hour within the peripheral portal vein ( Supplemental Figure S4B ) . At day 2 , the apical marker was partly lost at the outermost membrane of the cancer cell clusters , whereas lumens lined by apical membrane appeared inside the clusters . At day 5 , almost all CTOSs were apical - in ( Supplemental Figure S4B ) . At 4 weeks , all CTOSs were apical - in and featured large lumens lined with apical membrane . Dasatinib and Dynasore Suppress Formation of Liver Metastases Portal injection of C45 CTOSs ef ﬁ ciently generated foci of liver metastasis . Using the liver metastasis model , we examined the effects of dasatinib and dynasore . Dasatinib pretreatment alone had no signi ﬁ cant effect on the number of liver metastasis foci ( Supplemental Figure S5A ) . Dasatinib treatment of the mice without pretreatment also had no effect on the number of liver metastasis foci ( Supplemental Figure S5 , B and C ) .

Treatment of CTOSs and mice with dasatinib signi ﬁ cantly suppressed the number of liver metastasis foci compared with nontreated CTOSs ( Figure 5 ½ F5 (cid:4) ½ F5 (cid:4) , A e C ) . Meanwhile , pretreatment alone with dynasore signi ﬁ cantly suppressed the number of liver metastasis foci compared with nontreated CTOSs ( Figure 5 , D e F ) . Treatment with Dasatinib or Pretreatment with Dynasore Delays Polarity Switching in Vitro and in Vivo , Accompanied by Remarkable Cell Death Only in Vivo We investigated the role of polarity switching in the process of forming liver metastases in vivo . We examined the effects of pretreatment with dasatinib or dynasore on CTOSs in vitro . CTOSs were cultured in medium that contained dasatinib for 24 hours or dynasore for 48 hours in suspen - sion . After washing out the drugs , CTOSs were cultured in gel in vitro . Delay of the polarity switch from apical - out to apical - in was still observed in both cases at 24 hours ( Supplemental Figure S5D ) . The growth rate of dasatinib - treated CTOSs in vitro did not differ from that of control at any time point ( Figure 6 ½ F6 (cid:4) ½ F6 (cid:4) A ) . In contrast , the growth rate of dynasore - treated CTOSs in vitro was slightly lower than that of control around day 7 but eventually caught up with control ( Figure 6D ) . Neither treatment induced cell death ( Supplemental Figure S5E ) . Time course analysis of polar - ity status in the liver after the injection of CTOSs revealed a remarkable delay of polarity switching in the dasatinib - treated CTOSs ( Figure 6B and Supplemental Figure S6A ) and the dynasore - pretreated CTOSs ( Figure 6E and Supplemental Figure S6B ) . In cancer cell clusters in the liver at day 5 after CTOS injection into the portal vein , we observed disorganized structure and a remarkable increase of cell death with both dasatinib treatment ( Figure 6C ) and dynasore pretreatment ( Figure 6F ) . Discussion The function of epithelial plasticity , the ability of epithelial cells to reversibly alter their phenotype , is attracting increasing attention in cancer metastasis . 32 When a tumor metastasizes , its cells reportedly undergo epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) and acquire a migratory and invasive phenotype . Meanwhile , the reversion of EMT , the mesenchymal - to - epithelial transition ( MET ) , is essential for metastasized cells to settle in the target organ . 33 We found that CTOSs can form metastases , even though they retain cell - cell contact with the ultrastructure of the epithe - lial cell - cell junction and membranous localization of E - cadherin in both gel and suspension culture conditions . Thus , the metastasis of cancer cell clusters might not necessarily be accompanied by the EMT / MET that happens in single cell e originated metastasis . Polarity switching might be a key event for epithelial plasticity in differentiated CRC ( Figure 7 ½ F7 (cid:4) ½ F7 (cid:4) ) . Spread and the development of metastasis are intimately dependent on the interaction between the tumor cells and the surrounding tumor microenvironment . 34 Inter - action between single cells and the microenvironment has been intensively studied . In this study , we found that microenvironment is also a critical cue for polarity switching and possibly subsequent metastasis in CTOSs because CTOSs had an apical - in phenotype within type I collagen gel , whereas ﬂ oating CTOSs had an apical - out phenotype . Inter - play of tumor cell clusters with the microenvironment should be elucidated more in detail in future . The extent of polarity switching varied among patients ( Figure 3D and Supplemental Figure S1B ) . We previously reported that the status of KRAS mutation in primary tumors is mostly preserved in CTOSs . 10 We did not ﬁ nd any cor - relation between KRAS mutation and extent of polarity switching . The viability of primary CTOSs in culture affected their ability to switch polarities : all the CTOSs with poor growth ( four of eight ) also exhibited poor polarity switching . Thus , poor switching of polarity in CTOSs might be , at least in part , an artifact of in vitro culture conditions . In any case , polarity switching is a general characteristic of CRC - derived CTOSs . The discrepancy between villin and ezrin expression in ﬂ oating CTOSs might be due to different levels of maturity in apical membrane ; villin might be expressed only in the matured apical membrane in CTOSs . Indeed , electron microscopic analysis revealed that the length of microvilli on the outermost cells on ﬂ oating CTOSs was lower than that on the lumens inside CTOSs in gel ( Figure 1 , C e H ) , indicating that apical membrane on ﬂ oating CTOSs might be more immature than that on CTOSs in gel . Ashley et al 9 reported that the C80 and SW1222 cell lines , which were relatively differentiated CRC cell lines , expressed both villin and ezrin in lumens inside cell clusters . In contrast , the HCT116 cell line , which was an undifferentiated line , did not express villin but strongly expressed ezrin , although in a nonpolarized manner . How cell polarity is oriented has been intensively studied with MDCK cells and with mammary epithelial cells grown as hollow cysts . 31 , 35 De novo lumen formation is accom - plished by the initial adherence of cells lacking a luminal space on 3D Matrigel , exocytosis of vehicles to a central luminal region , and then the generation of apical - basal polarization . 36 Many laboratories have examined the mo - lecular mechanisms that regulate de novo lumen formation or the reorientation of polarity . When cells interact with the ECM through integrins , downstream signals ( eg , Rac1 ) 27 , 35 are activated and RhoA is inactivated . 37 In mammary epithelia , an ILK - microtubule pathway is used instead of Rac1 . 31 Apical proteins undergo endocytosis from the membrane that directly interacts with ECM and transcytosis to the opposite apical membrane . 31 A new apical face is established in opposition to the basement membrane , which subsequently leads to lumen formation .

It takes approximately 18 hours for polarity to switch in CRC CTOSs ; in comparison , polarity reorientation in MDCK cells or primary mammary epithelium takes several days . 31 , 38 In addition , CTOSs can survive and even grow in suspension , enabling the switch from apical - in to apical - out ; however , suspension culture of spheroids from normal crypt has not been reported . 21 As with lumen formation in normal cells , polarity switching in CTOS was also triggered by attachment to or detachment from the ECM , which was partially inhibited by an integrin b 1 e blocking antibody . In contrast to normal lumen formation , polarity switching in CTOSs was suppressed by neither inhibitors of FAK or ILK nor destabilizers of microtubules . In contrast , inhibitors of Src and DNM ef ﬁ ciently suppressed polarity switching . Altered intracellular signaling or membrane traf ﬁ cking systems in cancer cells might cause this discrepancy . Indeed , we found that Src activity is critical for polarity switching of CTOSs , a fact that has not been reported in Figure 6 Delayed polarity switching and increased apoptosis in vivo after pretreatment with dasatinib or dynasore .

The Src mole - cule is downstream of integrin signals , 39 and Src expression is generally stronger in CRC specimens than in normal colonic epithelium . 40 Increased Src activity is reportedly an independent indicator of poor clinical prognosis at all stages of colon cancer . 41 High levels of Src activity in CRC might contribute to the rapid switching of polarity in CTOS compared with normal epithelial cells or MDCK cells . The Src inhibitor dasatinib and the DNM inhibitor dynasore were each able to suppress polarity switching . Dasatinib is a multi e tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets Src family kinases and receptor tyrosine kinases ( c - Kit , platelet - derived growth factor receptor [ PDGFR ] a and b , DDR1 , c - FMS , ephrin receptors , and epidermal growth factor receptor [ EGFR ] ) and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases ( FRK , BRK , and ACK ) . 42 , 43 Dasatinib is also a BCR / Abl inhibitor approved for use in patients with chronic mye - logenous leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome e positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia . Given that other Src in - hibitors and siRNA of Src also suppressed polarity switch - ing , we conclude that Src is a target of dasatinib . However , because dasatinib had the strongest effect among the Src inhibitors tested , it is possible that other targets of dasatinib were also involved in polarity switching because dasatinib targets a broad spectrum of kinases . We examined the mRNA expression of target kinases of dasatinib in the CTOSs by RT - PCR and found that C45 CTOSs expressed a substantial amount of not only SRC but also LYN and YES ( Supplemental Figures S7 and S8 , A and B ) . These Src kinase families might also play a role in polarity switching . Because imatinib had no effect on polarity switching , ABL , c - Kit , and PDGF are not likely to be key regulators of polarity switching ( Supplemental Figure S3A ) . Dynasore is an inhibitor of DNMs ( including DNM - 1 and DNM - 2 ) , large GTPases that are essential for endocytosis and membrane traf ﬁ cking . 44 Dynasore suppresses lumen formation in mammary epithelial cells . 31 DNM - 2 activates Rac1 , 45 which in turn is involved in lumen formation in MDCK cells . 35 Dynasore might suppress polarity switching through the inactivation of RAC1 in CTOSs . Because DNM - 2 is reportedly a substrate of Src kinase , 46 , 47 it might be an effector of Src activation in CTOSs . It has been reported that low expression of DNM2 is correlated with shorter overall survival of the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma , suggesting that low levels of DNM2 may rather promote metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma . 48 In our study , RT - PCR revealed that the mRNA expression levels of DNM2 were high enough to be easily detected in all CTOSs examined ( Supplemental Figure S8A ) . We did not ﬁ nd CTOSs with low expression levels of DNM2 ; therefore , polarity switching in such CTOSs is unknown . Among these DNM2 - expressing CTOSs , DNM2 levels did not correlate with the ability of polarity switching ( Supplemental Figure S8C ) . Thus , inhibition of DNM2 sup - pressed polarity switching , but steady - state levels of DNM2 did not correlate with polarity switching . It is also reported that inhibition of DNM2 suppresses invasion of human osteosarcoma cell line . 49 Function of DNM2 might depend on the cell context . Unlike with dynasore , pretreatment alone with dasatinib did not suppress liver metastasis ; additional posttreatment with dasatinib was required . Treatment with dasatinib affected neither growth nor death in vitro . The time course of polarity switching after pretreatment with dasatinib or dynasore exhibited a similar pattern . Thus , the reason why posttreatment with dasatinib is required must still be clari ﬁ ed . We found that dasatinib and dynasore each inhibited liver implantation of CRC CTOSs in vivo . Dasatinib and dyna - sore each reportedly suppress the migration of cancer cells , 49 , 50 but the cell death in injected CTOSs happened before cancer cells migrated into the liver parenchyma . Pretreatment of CTOSs alone was suf ﬁ cient for dynasore to suppress liver implantation of the CTOSs .

A : At a primary site , original tumor nests display apical - in polarity . When tumor cell clusters invade blood or lymphatic vessels , clusters of cancer cells inside the vessel lumen exhibit apical - out polarity . These clusters may grow and ﬁ ll the vessel lumen to form apical - in nests or may be carried away by the ﬂ ow of blood or lymph . B : At a distant metastatic site , tumor clusters with apical - out polarity attach to the vessel walls , extravasate from the vessel lumen , and form metastatic foci , which in turn come to exhibit apical - in polarity . If tumor clusters retain the apical - out phenotype inside the vessel lumen , they are eliminated from the bloodstream through an unknown mechanism .

In both cases , pretreatment induced neither remarkable growth retardation nor cell death in vitro , suggesting that the effect of dasatinib or dynasore in vivo might be due to inhibition of polarity switching rather than direct inhibition of apoptosis and proliferation . In contrast , a signi ﬁ cant increase of cell death was observed in cancer cell clusters in the liver in vivo . Because the delay of polarity switching is a common feature of CTOS pre - treated by two different drugs in vitro and in vivo , this delay is likely related to cell death in vivo . Because the presence of epithelial apical membrane in the bloodstream is abnormal , it is reasonable to speculate the existence of some unknown mechanism to eliminate cells with abnormal cellular components , such as apical membrane , from the bloodstream ( Figure 7 ) . We found that injected CTOSs underwent massive cell death even in immune - compromised mice when polarity switching was impaired , suggesting that acquired immunity is not necessary . Mochizuki et al 51 reported that von Willebrand factor is a serum factor that induces apoptosis of cancer cells in lung blood vessels . Alternatively , interaction between hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells and cancer cells might cause apoptosis in apical - out CTOSs in the liver . 52 In any case , quick polarity switching and subsequent adhesion might be necessary for cancer cell clusters to survive in the bloodstream ( Figure 7 ) . There was no remarkable correlation between polarity switching , SRC or DNM2 expression , and the clinical stage in nine CTOS lines and 12 primary CTOSs ( Figure 3D , Supplemental Figure S1B Supplemental Figure S8 , A e C , and Supplemental Table S2 ) , although a larger number of patient samples have to be evaluated to assess clinical rel - evancy to polarity switching in future . As for the functional role of polarity switching in patient tumor , we propose that polarity switching is not a simple observational phenomenon but is involved in liver metastasis of CRC because i ) polarity switching is a rapid and bidirec - tional phenomenon ; ii ) polarity switching is a common ability of CRC cell clusters ; iii ) apical - out phenotype was observed in the microvessel invasion in patient tumors , whereas both original tumor and metastatic foci were all apical - in pheno - type , except for micropapillary phenotype ; and iv ) inhibitors of Src and DNM , even with pretreatment in case of a DNM inhibitor , suppressed polarity switching both in vitro and in vivo and suppressed formation of metastatic foci in the liver when injected into portal vein . Nonetheless , because both Src and DNM have broad range of targets , it is hard to exclude the possibility that those inhibitors also affected the pathway irrelevant to polarity switching . It would be clari ﬁ ed when the molecules that are critical and speci ﬁ c to polarity switching are elucidated in future . Acknowledgments We thank Dr .
