Culture can also a ￿ ect people’s conceptions upon a variety of issues , ranging from feelings of loneliness to technology usability . As for the latter , it seems that Greek older adults make use of web technologies much less than the majority of their peers in Europe . Based on the fact that psychosocial attributes can also a ￿ ect technology usage , this exploratory quantitative research is an attempt to focus on the implicit factors related to Greek older adults’ usability ratings of web technologies . For this aim , a web 2 . 0 story - telling prototype has been demonstrated to 112 participants and an online questionnaire was applied for data collection . According to ￿ ndings , older adults’ loneliness and future time perspective were associated with system usability , whereas their chronological age did not have any statistically signi ￿ cant relationship with usability . These outcomes , which are extensively discussed , contribute to the limited literature in the ￿ eld by studying the interactions between older people’s psychosocial attributes and their perceived usability of online technologies .

Nevertheless , the mediating nature of technology bears also draw - backs . Ihde [ 21 ] declared that technology usage is not neutral and depicted that for each enhancement the mediating technologies pro - vide , there is also a concealed transformation of users’ experience and perceived reality . Likewise , several internal factors can a ￿ ect the experience , hence in ￿ uencing the way people value , accept or reject technologies . Moreover , from Plato’s cave allegory [ 18 ] and Indirect Realism [ 7 ] , there is a continuous discussion going on about how our conceptions of the world are mediated by perception . Human - Computer Interaction ( HCI ) constantly evolves . Start - ing from the First Wave and the science of cognition , through the Second Wave , and its focus on groups of users , it further advanced during the Third Wave to include issues of culture , emotions , experi - ences , and meaning - making [ 3 , 4 ] . During that course , philosophical foundations have also been embedded in technology orientation and design , embracing users’ needs for personal development . Ex - istentialism , for instance , based on the axiom that every human is responsible for himself / herself , thus having almost unlimited potentials for self - actualization , has been proposed as a visionary framework for understanding individuals and their relationship with technology [ 23 ] . Self - actualization and personal development are also related to one’s recollections . Older adults’ personal memories help them build a sense of identity and continuity to the self [ 36 ] . Due to literature , identity construction and maintenance is further pro - moted by sharing memories with others , storytellers’ narratives can vary across di ￿ erent cultures , and people constantly revise their life stories , which makes identity formation a life - long procedure [ 28 ] . Notably , healthy individuals sometimes recollect memories of events that never happened . This malfunction of our memory system perhaps addresses our needs related to the self as well as to our social interactions [ 31 ] . From a technological perspective , it has been proposed that memory recording interventions should promote users’ creativity and active engagement instead of pas - sively capturing segments of their activities for remembering [ 37 ] . Going a step further , digital platforms related to reminiscence and storytelling are apparently bene ￿ cial for older adults’ well - being ( e . g . [ 20 , 29 ] ) . During the last decades , older adults’ population increases world - wide . It has been estimated that in 2050 , the number of people aged 60 years and older will have doubled compared to the current demo - graphics . At that time , Japan , Spain , Portugal , and Greece will be 170 PETRA ’20 , June 30 - July 3 , 2020 , Corfu , Greece Alexandrakis et al . the countries with the greatest proportions of older inhabitants [ 38 ] . However , digital technology usage by older people still remains low compared to younger generations and , also , Internet adoption by Greek older adults is one of the lowest within the European Union [ 16 ] . This digital inequality within society excludes technol - ogy non - users from essential resources considering information , communication , and personal growth . Older adults’ choice of not adopting new technologies is not always due to usability issues [ 25 , 40 ] . During the last years , studies upon older adults and memories ( e . g . [ 1 , 27 ] ) , loneliness ( e . g . [ 12 ] ) , and Socioemotional Selectivity Theory ( e . g . [ 41 ] ) have been com - mon in the HCI ￿ eld . Hence , in this exploratory study , we try to gain further insights into the implicit factors that might correlate with Greek older adults’ usability conceptions of online technologies by focusing on a web 2 . 0 platform for reminiscing and storytelling . 2 RELATED LITERATURE AND RESEARCH HYPOTHESES Socioemotional Selectivity Theory is a theoretical framework that provides valuable insights into human motives and preferences [ 26 ] . Due to this theory , a person’s future time perspective ( FTP ) , denoting the perceived time that has been left in life , has an e ￿ ect on his / her choices . Individuals who feel that their future is open - ended tend to prioritize knowledge - based activities , whereas when they regard it as limited , they tend to prefer emotionally meaning - ful interactions . Chen and Chan [ 10 ] indicated that psychosocial attributes , such as fear of death or loneliness , may have an intrinsic e ￿ ect on older adults’ motives for technology usage . Loneliness is an issue that often troubles older populations . It has been generally described as an unpleasant state which is caused by people’s asymmetry between their desirable social relationships and the relationships they perceive that they have . Also , there are cultural di ￿ erences in perceived loneliness among Europeans [ 15 ] . Although there are contradictory ￿ ndings in the literature regard - ing the e ￿ ect of loneliness on motivation , it has been argued that loneliness a ￿ ects the person’s will to complete tasks [ 34 ] . Further - more , according to O’Luanaigh et al . [ 33 ] , loneliness is associated with older people’s cognition de ￿ cits , considering visual memory and psychomotor processing . As it seems , emotions act as cognitive drivers under the context of initial technology use [ 9 ] and perceived loneliness , among other psychosocial and emotional variables , is related to di ￿ erent web 2 . 0 usage patterns [ 13 ] . Chronological age is also related to cognition de ￿ cits . Working memory e ￿ ectiveness and processing speed , among others , are neg - atively a ￿ ected by higher age [ 35 ] . In addition , there are also visual , hearing , and haptic impairments related to older peoples’ physical states and manipulating digital technologies usually depends on users’ aforementioned abilities [ 19 ] . Additionally , there are di ￿ er - ent usage patterns of online tool use related to users’ age [ 13 , 17 ] . However , according to the literature , age is not only a construction de ￿ ned on the basis of time , but also a social construct that re ￿ ects the norms , the expectations , and the roles of each individual in the community that he / she lives in [ 14 ] . Considering usability , a concept that involves cognitive pro - cesses , there is a signi ￿ cant number of methods that have been proposed for its evaluation . A popular tool for collecting users’ sub - jective assessment of product usability is the System Usability Scale ( SUS ) , developed by Brooke [ 6 ] . It comprises of ten statements that sum up to a single number that denotes participant’s view upon a technology . Nevertheless , culture also a ￿ ects usability [ 39 ] and according to Bangor , Kortum , and Miller [ 2 ] , there is a variety of factors that could further in ￿ uence people’s usability ratings , such as the type of the interface being evaluated or the age of the users . Perceived barriers related to usability often impact technology adoption by older adults [ 13 ] . Since Greek older adults use the In - ternet much less compared to the vast majority of their peers in Europe [ 16 ] , in the current exploratory study we try to focus on three factors ( chronological age , loneliness , FTP ) that may correlate with Greek older people’s perceived usability of online technolo - gies . To the best of our knowledge , there is no similar research in literature . The hypotheses are : H1 . Older adults’ chronological age has a negative relationship with perceived usability . H2 . Older adults’ loneliness has a negative relationship with per - ceived usability . H3 . Older adults’ future time perspective has a positive relationship with perceived usability . 3 METHODOLOGY 3 . 1 Sampling and data collection tool The participants were recruited through snowball sampling . An online questionnaire was designed and distributed for data collec - tion and covered four categories : ( a ) demographics , ( b ) usability , ( c ) loneliness , and ( d ) future time perspective . The Greek transla - tion of the SUS [ 24 ] was implemented for the usability category and the Greek translation of the UCLA Loneliness Scale [ 22 ] was embedded for the loneliness category . Regarding the FTP construct , Carstensen and Lang’s [ 8 ] scale was translated into Greek and fur - ther reviewed by three English literature experts for this study . The tool was checked by an academic expert on questionnaire surveys and was pre - tested on ￿ ve older adults , which were not included in the ￿ nal sample . 3 . 2 Procedure The survey was online for 3 months , starting in April 2019 . Each respondent who entered the survey was informed about the project through a written introduction . Then a step - by - step presentation of the platform took place . In every step , the demonstration included texts and static images describing the platform interface , as well as screen recordings of the platform manipulation . The participants could control the presentation by repeating speci ￿ c parts of it or moving backward or forward until they were completely aware of how to use the platform . At the end of the presentation , they were prompted to answer the questionnaire . Similar methodologies , com - bining the evaluation of a product using SUS after its demonstration , have been also followed in other studies ( e . g . [ 5 , 32 ] ) . Technology should address end - users’ needs and , as it seems , sharing online personal memories can be a bene ￿ cial and mean - ingful activity for older adults . Thus , the web technology that was evaluated in the current study is a prototype of a digital storytelling platform that has been previously constructed using participatory 171 Implicit factors related to Greek older adults’ perceived usability of online technologies : An exploratory study PETRA ’20 , June 30 - July 3 , 2020 , Corfu , Greece Figure 1 : Initial page of the digital storytelling platform . design methods with ￿ ve Greek older adults [ 1 ] . With this platform , users can write and edit their stories , as well as read and comment on others’ narratives ( Figure 1 ) . 4 RESULTS 4 . 1 Descriptive statistics The ￿ nal sample comprised of 112 older adults ( 42 % male , 58 % female ) whose age ranged from 60 to 80 years ( mean : 66 . 96 , SD : 4 . 98 ) . Regarding the highest level of formal education received , data showed that 10 ( 9 % ) had rounded Primary Education , 6 ( 5 % ) and 15 ( 13 % ) had graduated from Lower and Upper Secondary Education respectively , 32 ( 29 % ) had a vocational training certi ￿ cate , and 47 ( 42 % ) had at least one University degree . As for the hardware they use to access the Internet , 46 ( 41 % ) respondents mentioned the desktop pc , 65 ( 58 % ) the laptop , 56 ( 50 % ) the tablet , and 89 ( 79 % ) the smartphone . Their loneliness scores were between 21 and 64 ( initial scale range : 20 - 80 , mean : 36 . 96 , SD : 8 . 77 ) and their scores on the FTP scale were between 10 and 67 ( initial scale range : 10 - 70 , mean : 37 . 43 , SD : 14 . 20 ) . As for the SUS scores , they ranged from 0 to 100 ( initial scale range : 0 - 100 , mean : 57 . 34 , SD : 21 . 69 ) . 4 . 2 Correlations between variables According to the Shapiro - Wilk test , participants’ age , as well as loneliness and FTP scores , were not normally distributed ( Table 1 ) . Hence , the correlations between the variables were analyzed using a non - parametric test , Spearman’s rank correlation coe ￿ cient [ 11 ] .

Age Scale . 941 . 000 Loneliness Ordinal . 974 . 030 FTP Ordinal . 968 . 009 Usability Ordinal . 980 . 098 According to ￿ ndings , there was a statistically valid negative relationship between loneliness and usability ( r = - . 234 , p < . 01 ) and a positive relationship between FTP and usability ( r = . 329 , p < . 001 ) ( Table 2 ) . However , no valid correlation was observed between age and usability ( r = - . 125 , n . s . ) . Table 2 : Variables’ correlations with Usability ( SUS ) Variable Correlation Coe ￿ cient Sig . ( 1 - tailed ) Age - . 125 . 094 Loneliness - . 234 . 007 FTP . 329 . 000 5 DISCUSSION Due to the results , users’ chronological age does not a ￿ ect their perceived usability , which contradicts Bangor et al . ’s [ 2 ] ￿ ndings . This outcome opposes the stereotype that new technologies and older people do not get along and is congruent with Hauk et al . ’s [ 19 ] suggestions that age - e ￿ ects are activated only for technologies that do not respond to older people’s needs . Another possible expla - nation for the aforementioned contradiction could be the cultural di ￿ erences between the research samples , which is a factor that often a ￿ ects usability [ 39 ] . Loneliness correlates with older users’ SUS scores , denoting that the lonelier the user is , the lower his / her score is on perceived usability . Although from a di ￿ erent perspective , this relationship is consistent and extends Cenfetelli’s [ 9 ] ￿ ndings regarding the role of emotions on technology usage , as well as Díaz - Prieto and García - Sánchez’s [ 13 ] ￿ ndings regarding older adults’ feelings of loneliness and web 2 . 0 usage patterns . As for the FTP and its relationship with usability , the con ￿ rma - tion of the analogous hypothesis seems to extend Socioemotional Selectivity Theory . In particular , the subjective estimation of time left in someone’s life is positively associated not only with his / her motives towards knowledge - based activities but also with the re - sults of knowledge - based processes , such as perceived usability and ease of use estimation of technology . Also , despite the connection that often appears in the literature between FTP and chronological age [ 26 ] , in the current study on Greek older adults only FTP was related to their SUS scores . In general , the outcomes of this study focus on the signi ￿ cance of the relationship between users’ psychosocial perceptions and usability . Analogous prompts have been suggested within the multi - disciplinary ￿ eld of Gerontechnology [ 10 ] , as well as in the broader discipline of HCI [ 3 , 4 ] . 6 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK This research has some limitations due to its exploratory nature . First , this project focused on a speci ￿ c technology and , also , the participants did not use the technology itself . Second , the sample was limited and non - parametric . Third , there was no feedback from older people who do not use web technologies . As a result , the ￿ ndings cannot be generalized to the broader population , but can be used for further research : ( i ) Carry out usability measurements on di ￿ erent web tools and with older users that have previously used each technology , ( ii ) gather a broader sample under probability sampling , and ( iii ) collect qualitative and quantitative feedback from non - users . An experiment that could lead to safe conclusions upon causality is also suggested . 172 PETRA ’20 , June 30 - July 3 , 2020 , Corfu , Greece Alexandrakis et al . 7 CONCLUSION Older adults’ population constantly grows . However , technology adoption still lacks compared to younger generations and , notably , Greek older adults are one of the least connected to the Internet groups , compared to the vast majority of their European peers . As it seems , di ￿ erent cultures and psychosocial attributes can a ￿ ect users’ perceptions upon several issues , ranging from feelings of loneliness to technology usability . Thus , the aim of this project was to explore the potential relationship between ( i ) Greek older adults’ age , feelings of loneliness , and future time perspective and ( ii ) their perceived usability of a web application , in order to gain further insights into the elements that might a ￿ ect technology adoption and usage . For this purpose , a digital storytelling prototype has been demonstrated to 112 participants and an online structured questionnaire was implemented for data collection . According to the results , participants’ feelings of loneliness and future time per - spective correlate with their perceived usability . On the contrary , no signi ￿ cant relationship was found between chronological age and usability . These results could help scholars , designers , stakeholders , and caregivers better understand the implicit interactions between older adults and web 2 . 0 tools , in order to promote the privileges derived from the acceptance and use of these innovations .
