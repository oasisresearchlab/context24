INTRODUCTION The relationship between the composition and structure of plant primary cell walls , and cell mechanical properties is not fully understood . The strength of the cell wall is considered to be mainly due to cellulose microﬁbrils ( Fry , 1995 ) but the contribution of other wall components and their interaction with cellulose is not clear ( Cosgrove , 2000 a ) . Ideally , one would relate the material properties of the cell wall to its composition and structure , preferably using a functional genomics approach , and consider how and why these properties respond to the cell environment . In this respect , the relative simplicity of undifferentiated single cells from suspension cultures makes them a useful tool . Using single cells , one could conceive of using functional genomics to deﬁne the roles of different cell wall polymer types in determining cell wall mechanical behaviour . However , no reliable method of measuring the material properties of walls of single cells has yet been reported . Using mainly uniaxial stretching , mechanical tests on isolated walls have indicated that the cell wall material is non - linear viscoelastic - plastic ( e . g . Kawamura et al . , 1995 ) . Attempts have been made to simulate turgor and multiaxial tensions in some experiments ( Kamiya et al . , 1963 ; Richmond et al . , 1980 ) , but it would be preferable to study walls in situ with the actual turgor and original geometry of living cells . The properties of living and dead cells with growing or non - growing walls may be different . A micro - penetration technique has been used for mechan - ical testing of potato tuber parenchyma tissue ( Hiller et al . , 1996 ; Davies et al . , 1998 ) , leading to calculated values of cell wall stiffness . Unfortunately these values depended on a difﬁcult estimation of cell radius . In any case , this method cannot be used on single cells , although it is a potentially valuable method for studies on tissue . The pressure probe is an excellent tool for studying plant water relationships and can provide some mechanical property measurements ( Tomos , 2000 ) . However , it has only rarely been used on single suspension cells ( Tomos and Leigh , 1999 ; Hukin , 2002 ) . Furthermore , the pressure probe method can only cause small deformations , not deform - ations leading to cell bursting . Therefore it cannot be used to investigate the full range of cell wall mechanical behaviour . A method of studying particle mechanics that has recently been used on many cell types is micromanipu - lation , in which a single cell is compressed between ﬂat , parallel surfaces to provide information on the whole - cell mechanical response to an applied compressive load ( Zhang et al . , 1991 ; Thomas et al . , 2000 ) .

Key measurements are bursting force and percentage deformation at bursting , but these are not ‘intrinsic’ properties of the walls , i . e . they have values that depend on the measurement method . Intrinsic wall material parameters such as Young’s modulus are required if the mechanical properties of the wall are ever to be related to its composition and structure . It would be useful therefore to be able to extract these properties from force - deformation data , and this can be achieved by mathematical modelling . As pointed out by Smith et al . ( 1998 ) , this task is facilitated if the form of the cell wall constitutive equation is known a priori . The cell wall material properties can then be determined by matching the force - deformation response of the math - ematical model to that obtained in a compression experiment . Several investigators have modelled the compression mechanics of thin - walled , liquid - ﬁlled spheres . Thin walls in this mechanical context are often referred to as ‘mem - branes’ . Such a membrane is a thin material element that cannot support bending stresses across its thickness . A cell wall might be considered to be a ( mechanical ) membrane . Feng and Yang ( 1973 ) considered the problem of the deformation and the consequential stresses in an inﬂated , non - linear elastic , gas - ﬁlled spherical membrane com - pressed between two frictionless rigid plates . Lardner and Pujara ( 1980 ) extended this model further by considering the sphere to be ﬁlled with an incompressible liquid rather than gas . Their model was able to predict accurately the deformation of sea urchin eggs , as previously reported by Yoneda ( 1973 ) . Liu et al . ( 1996 ) improved the computa - tional algorithm , and applied the model to data on microcapsules . None of these studies allowed for water loss from the sphere . Smith et al . ( 1998 ) created a ﬁnite element model in which volume loss was included , and applied this to compression data from yeast cells ( Smith et al . , 2000 ) . Using a ﬁnite element method , it was possible in principle to consider any cell wall material constitutive equation , although in practice Smith et al . ( 2000 ) only considered the linear elastic case . There are only two reports of use of the compression experiment to characterize intrinsic material properties of plant primary cell walls . Liu ( 1995 ) attempted to estimate Young’s modulus from compression experiments on single pericarp tissue tomato cells , but obtained few data . In an extensive study , Blewett ( 2000 ) developed the experimental method used here , but found it difﬁcult to derive Young’s modulus by mathematical modelling . Bounds of 100 – 2300 MPa were found for single suspension - cultured tomato cells . In the present work , a linear elastic material model was used to determine Young’s modulus of walls of single undifferentiated tomato cells from suspension cultures . The quality of the ﬁt of this model to experimental data , and the sensitivity of the model to changes in parameter values , were investigated . MATERIALS AND METHODS Tomato cell suspensions Cell cultures and isolation of single tomato cells have been described elsewhere ( Blewett et al . , 2000 ) . The tomato cell line Lycopersicon esculentum vf36 was used as a model system . This is a suspension culture derived from a root radicle callus ( provided by Unilever Research Colworth , Bedford , UK ) . Cells were subcultured weekly in medium consisting of MS basal salts ( 43 g for 10 L ) , 30 g sucrose L – 1 , 2 mg 2 , 4 - dichlorophenoxy acetic acid ( 2 , 4 - D ) L – 1 , 1 mg 2 , isopentyladenine L – 1 , and 50 m L vitamin solution ( 100 mg nicotinic acid , 40 mg glycine , 10 mg pyridoxine hydro - chloride , 10 mg thiamine hydrochloride , 10 mg folic acid , 1 mg biotin , 20 mL water ) . The pH was initially 6·0 . Cells were grown in a horizontal rotary shaker set at 100 rpm and 25 (cid:176) C with low light . Suspension cultures obtained by this method are nearly in synchronous growth , and so the cells within a sample are of similar age ( Blewett et al . , 2000 ) . Single cells were evident in the culture from week 2 and passage through a 72 m m mesh separated them from any aggregates . The single cells were suspended in 0·03 M mannitol at pH 5 , the same osmolality and pH as the medium at harvest . They were held at 27 6 1 (cid:176) C during compression testing . Compression experiment The basic experimental apparatus and procedure were described by Blewett et al . ( 2000 ) . Cells were compressed between the ﬂat end of an optic ﬁbre ( the micromanipulation probe ) and a glass surface ( see Fig . 1 ) . The probe was mounted on a force transducer , which in turn was mounted on a micromanipulator ( MicroInstruments Ltd , Oxford , UK ) . This allowed the probe to be driven at a chosen speed towards the slide , compressing the cell . The chosen speed here was 23 m m s – 1 . The voltage and the time of deformation could be recorded on a PC - 30D data acquisition card ( Amplicon Live - line , Brighton , UK ) in a personal computer . Figure 2A shows typical raw data . A ﬁve - point moving average was used to smooth the data and to determine the exact start of the compression . Using the speed of motion of the probe , and allowing for compliance ( Mashmoushy et al . , 1998 ) , the probe displacement and the cell deformation could be calculated , and a force - deformation curve gener - ated , as shown in Fig . 2B . The parameters required and the measurements taken To remove some of the risks of the model producing non - unique solutions that would ﬁt the experimental curve using different combinations of parameter values ( Smith et al . , 1998 ) , some of the parameters were ﬁxed by using values previously measured on cells grown under the same conditions . These are described below . Initial thickness of the cell wall . Using freeze - fracture scanning electron microscopy , the mean cell wall thickness of 2 - week - old tomato cells from suspension cultures has 444 Wang et al . — Mechanical Modelling of Tomato Cells D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / aob / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 93 / 4 / 443 / 197237 b y gue s t on 1 2 S ep t e m be r 2018 been found to be 126 6 16 nm ( Blewett , 2000 ) . This value was used as the initial wall thickness in the model . Internal osmotic pressure of the cell and the initial turgor pressure . The mean initial osmotic pressure of the cells under the conditions of test was measured directly by single - cell sampling followed by freezing point depression ( Tomos et al . , 1994 ) . The mean initial turgor pressure was calculated by subtracting the external osmolality from the internal osmolality . For the 2 - week - old tomato cells , the mean initial osmotic pressure difference and therefore the mean initial turgor pressure was found to be 0·363 MPa . MODELLING Model deﬁnition To derive material properties from force - deformation data , a mechanical model must be developed . The model formulated here is based on that of Lardner and Pujara ( 1980 ) , considering the plant cell wall and membrane as a liquid - ﬁlled sphere . Unlike Lardner and Pujara ( 1980 ) , the wall is considered to be permeable . The outer radius of the uninﬂated sphere ( equivalent to the cell at incipient plasmolysis ) is r 0 ( Fig . 3A ; see Table 1 for list of symbols used ) and its initial wall thickness is h 0 . The sphere is inﬂated by an internal pressure to an outer radius of r i ( Fig . 3B ) . Then the initial stretch ratio l s is deﬁned as l s = r i / r 0 . The inﬂated sphere is then compressed between two ﬂat , parallel surfaces , with the top surface moving at a constant velocity towards the bottom surface . Following Lardner and Pujara ( 1980 ) , it is also assumed that the cell is axi - symmetrical around its vertical axis before and during compression , and is symmetric across its equatorial plane . The geometry of this problem is shown in Fig . 3C . The liquid is taken to be incompressible , but the wall is considered permeable and so the internal volume decreases with compression . Equation ( 1 ) describes the volume change ( Kedem and Katchalky , 1958 ) . d V d t (cid:136) L p A (cid:133) D P (cid:255) Dp (cid:134) (cid:133) 1 (cid:134) where V is the instantaneous internal volume , t is time , L p is the hydraulic conductivity of the cell wall , A is the area available for ﬂow , D P = P external – P internal is the hydrostatic pressure difference and Dp = p external – p internal is the osmotic pressure difference . As the probe velocity ( v ) is constant , the volume change can be related to the distance that the cell has been compressed , rather than to time ( Smith et al . , 1998 ) : d V d z (cid:136) 2 L p v A (cid:133) D P (cid:255) Dp (cid:134) (cid:133) 2 (cid:134) where z is half the distance the cell has been compressed ( see Fig . 3C ) . Equation ( 2 ) assumes that solutes do not pass through the cell membrane , that the cytoplasm is a dilute and ideal solution , and that the hydraulic conductivity of the wall , L p , is constant throughout compression . It is further assumed here that the osmotic pressure difference ( Dp ) is constant during compression , i . e . the water ﬂows into or out of the cell cause negligible changes in internal cell solute F IG . 1 .

The area available for ﬂow is taken to be the exposed area , i . e . the area not in contact with the two ﬂat surfaces . To model the cell , the cell wall material properties ( its constitutive equation ) need to be considered . Here the cell wall is considered to be isotropic and its constitutive equation to be linear elastic and compressible ( Poisson’s ratio n is not 0·5 ) . The behaviour is also assumed to be time - independent , i . e . no viscoelasticity . It should be noted that the time - scale of the compression experiments is of the order of 1 s , far too rapid for many physiological responses that may change the cell wall material characteristics , e . g . the creep phenomenon described by Cosgrove ( 2000 b ) . The theoretical analysis and numerical simulation The derivation of the equations governing the deform - ation of the cell is based on analysis by Feng and Yang ( 1973 ) and Lardner and Pujara ( 1980 ) . The derivation is given in the Appendix . In the numerical simulations , the governing equations were solved by a Runge – Kutta method , using the Matlab ( MathWorks Inc . ) ode45 solver . As the chosen constitutive equation for the wall material is time - independent , the compression of the cell was solved as a series of static equilibrium problems following the calculation procedure of Liu et al . ( 1996 ) . In each step , the model simulates the displacement of the probe corresponding to the time between steps . The probe displacement deforms the cell from its previous shape . During the time taken for the step there may be water loss , depending on the wall permeabil - ity . At the end of the step , the volume of the deformed sphere is determined from the calculated cell boundary coordinates r and h ( see Fig . 3C ) . The equations are given in the Appendix . As in the method of Liu et al . ( 1996 ) , the simulated pressure is then adjusted until the new volume equals the previous volume minus any estimated water loss . This pressure is then the starting pressure for the next step . The simulations lead to predicted force - deformation data , which depend on the values of the model parameters . These are the hydraulic conductivity ( L p ) , which determines the water ﬂow from the cell ; Young’s modulus ( E ) ; Poisson’s ratio ( n ) , which describes the compressibility of the cell wall material ; and the initial stretch ratio ( l s ) , which is the diameter of the cell at the start of compression compared with that at incipient plasmolysis . Dimensionless analysis To reduce the number of variables and to gain insight , a dimensionless analysis was conducted . The force has a dimensionless form of F / ( Eh 0 r 0 l 0 2 ) and the deformation X = z / ( r 0 l s ) , where z is half the distance the cell has been compressed , i . e . half the displacement of the probe .

These simulations were carried out by changing the hydraulic conductivity ( L p ) , Poisson’s ratio ( n ) and initial stretch ratio ( l s ) . Other parameters were either ﬁxed a priori ( h 0 , Dp i and v ) or were to be found by ﬁtting ( E ) . Effect of hydraulic conductivity ( L p ) Typical simulation results are shown in Fig . 4 . It can be seen that increasing the hydraulic conductivity ( L p ) pro - duced a lower force for a given displacement . If the cell membrane has a higher hydraulic conductivity , then the resistance to ﬂow is lower , and this will lead to a lower increase in pressure during the deformation because of the greater water loss . It has been reported that L p values of different plant cell types range from 2 3 10 – 8 to 10 – 5 ms – 1 MPa – 1 ( Maurel , 1997 ) . For single tomato cells , the hydraulic conductivity is about 10 – 7 ms – 1 MPa – 1 ( Maggio et al . , 1995 ; Hukin et al . , 2002 ) . The two curves in Fig . 4 for L p = 0 and L p = 10 – 7 ms – 1 MPa – 1 almost coincide , especially at smaller cell deformations ( up to about 20 % ) . So , although the wall is considered permeable , it is reasonable in the case of rapid compression at small deformations to neglect water loss in simulations . Effect of Poisson’s ratio ( n ) In previous analyses of compression of a liquid - ﬁlled sphere or a cell ( Lardner and Pujara , 1980 ; Smith et al . , 1998 ) , the wall was taken to be incompressible , equivalent to a Poisson’s ratio of 0·5 . In this study cell wall material is considered to be compressible , with a Poisson’s ratio of less than 0·5 . However , no data are available concerning the Poisson’s ratio of tomato cell walls and there is no reliable method to measure this parameter . Therefore a range of values from 0·3 to 0·5 was used in simulations to investigate the inﬂuence of Poisson’s ratio on the force - deformation curves . Figure 5 shows typical simulation results . There is no great difference in the force at a given deformation for a change in Poisson’s ratio from 0·3 to 0·5 , especially at small deformations . This is consistent with the low sensitivity to Poisson’s ratio of the calculated elastic modulus of cell walls of potato tuber parenchyma tissue , found by a micro - penetration technique ( Hiller et al . , 1996 ) . To conﬁrm that the results are insensitive to Poisson’s ratio , the simulated deformed proﬁles of the compressed cells were compared at a different Poisson’s ratio . No difference was observed that could be distinguished easily ( e . g . by image analyses of cell proﬁles ) . Thus , it was not possible to obtain a reliable value of Poisson’s ratio from ﬁts to force - deformation data , but as the choice is not critical , a Poisson’s ratio of 0·4 was chosen for all subsequent model ﬁts . Effect of initial stretch ratio ( l s ) Among the factors that might inﬂuence the force - deformation curves , some were ﬁxed a priori . These were the initial thickness of the cell wall ( 126 nm ) , the osmotic pressure difference across the cell wall ( 0·363 MPa ) , and the probe motion velocity ( 23 m m s – 1 ) . As described above , hydraulic conductivity and Poisson’s ratio were not found to be of signiﬁcance . However , the initial stretch ratio , l s , i . e . the inﬂation of cell above incipient plasmolysis , was potentially important . It is very difﬁcult to measure the initial stretch ratio of tomato cells accurately and , in any case , it is not practical to measure this ratio for individual cells before each compression experiment . Therefore a series of initial stretch ratios were tried in simulations . Figure 6 shows the resulting simulated force - deformation curves . The inﬂuence of initial stretch ratio on force - deformation curves was clearly signiﬁcant . A check on the simulated shape of the cell boundary conﬁrmed this ( see Fig . 7 ) . F IG . 4 .

DATA ANALYSIS Matching force - deformation curves The remaining unknowns , i . e . initial stretch ratio l s and Young’s modulus , E , can be found by matching force - deformation curves from simulations with data obtained from compression experiments . A series of simulations with different initial stretch ratios were generated . The values chosen were 1·005 , 1·01 , 1·015 , 1·02 , 1·03 , 1·04 and 1·05 . Figure 6 shows data for initial stretch ratios of 1·005 , 1·01 and 1·015 only . In each case simulated and experimental force - deformation curves were compared for deformations up to 20 % , with Young’s modulus adjusted to give best ﬁt , using a minimum root mean square error . For each experimental force - deformation curve , this method resulted in a value of Young’s modulus for each l s value . Root mean square errors were then used to choose overall best ﬁt , and therefore to determine the best value of l s and Young’s modulus . An example of such ﬁtting is shown in Table 2 and Fig . 8 . As can be seen from Table 2 , the best value of l s and Young’s modulus for these data were 1·015 and 2·41 GPa , respectively . The good ﬁt , which is typical , indicates that the linear elastic model is suitable for determining the Young’s modulus of the walls of the tomato cells used in this study . Fitting data from 22 cells , the mean Young’s modulus of 2 - week - old tomato cell walls at pH 5·0 and 27 (cid:176) C was found to be 2·3 6 0·2 GPa , which is comparable with values reported in the literature , as discussed later . An average initial stretch ratio of 1·01 6 0·002 was obtained , consistent with a value of 1·01 6 0·002 found using image analysis on similar cells ( Blewett , 2000 ) . This shows that it is possible to determine the initial stretch ratio of tomato cells through modelling force - deformation data . Because the micromanipulation method does not allow meaningful hysteresis experiments on rapidly adapting cells , the appropriate deformation range for elastic beha - viour of the cell walls could not be found directly . The chosen upper bound of 20 % cell deformation was validated by determining Young’s modulus for the typical data of Fig . 2 , with upper bounds of 10 , 15 , 20 and 25 % cell deformation . Table 3 shows the results . The modulus was not signiﬁcantly different whether 10 , 15 or 20 % was used , but appeared to drop at 25 % . This suggested elastic behaviour up to 20 % cell deformation . It should be noted that the correlation coefﬁcient for all the bounds was very high ( > 0·95 ) . It was assumed that an upper bound of cell deformation of 20 % could be used in all subsequent analyses , and this was conﬁrmed by continued good ﬁts of experimental and simulation data . 20 % cell deformation represents a wall strain of about 0·07 at the cell equator . DISCUSSION Compression of cells by micromanipulation can be used to obtain force - deformation data up to cell bursting . However , bursting force and percentage deformation at bursting are not intrinsic parameters , as they depend on bulk cell behaviour , not only on cell wall composition and structure . In the present study , a linear elastic material model has been used to extract Young’s modulus of cell walls of single suspension tomato cells from low - strain force - deformation data . Although the cell wall and membrane were taken to be permeable and the model could therefore account for any volume loss by ﬂow from the cell , this was found to be insigniﬁcant on the time scale of the compression ( 1 s ) , assuming a reasonable value for the hydraulic conductivity of single tomato cells ( 10 – 7 ms – 1 MPa – 1 ) . Water loss through the cell wall was therefore neglected in simulations . However , given the range of L p values for plant cells in general ( 2 3 10 – 8 to 10 – 5 ms – 1 MPa – 1 ; Maurel , 1997 ) , this assumption might not be true for compression tests on other plant cell types nor indeed on single tomato cells under other conditions . Should the assumption not be valid , F IG . 6 .

Preliminary studies have shown that L p might be found by compressing cells and holding them , and measuring volume loss directly using image analysis ( Blewett , 2000 ) . This would be a powerful adjunct to the present method . The cell wall was taken to be compressible in this study , which meant that Poisson’s ratio could not be 0·5 , as often assumed in other compression experiment studies ( e . g . Lardner and Pujara , 1980 ; Smith et al . , 2000 ) . However , it was shown in the simulations that there was no great difference in the force at a given deformation for changes in Poisson’s ratio from 0·3 to 0·5 . This is unfortunate , as it does not seem likely that the Poisson’s ratio of plant cell walls could ever be estimated from force - deformation data , or even from a study of the cell shape during compression . On the other hand , the insensitivity of the modelling to this ratio means that Young’s modulus might be found without this knowledge . The choice of a Poisson’s ratio of 0·4 for model ﬁtting seems reasonable , although it would be equally acceptable from a modelling viewpoint to assume a value of 0·5 , i . e . incompressible cell walls . Compared with Poisson’s ratio , the inﬂuence of Young’s modulus and initial stretch ratio on the force - deformation curves was found to be very signiﬁcant . Adjusting these parameters allowed very good ﬁts between model and low - strain experimental data . Low strain in this study was taken to mean < 20 % cell deformation . Typically this represents wall strains of < 0·07 . The good ﬁtting up to these strains indicates that the linear elastic model is very suitable for determining primary cell wall Young’s moduli from micromanipulation experiments , at least for these undiffer - entiated tomato cells . It is not known if this observation is applicable to other plant cell types . The mean Young’s modulus of the walls of 2 - week - old cultured tomato cells was found to be 2·3 6 0·2 GPa . This value cannot be compared with values for similar cells in the literature , as such data are not available . Besides Blewett ( 2000 ) , who estimated values for single suspension - cultured tomato cells of 100 – 2300 MPa , the nearest study was on potato tuber parenchyma tissue cells , using a micro - penetration technique ( Hiller et al . , 1996 ) . A value of 3 GPa was indicated by the analysis , assuming a cell wall thickness of 100 nm . For giant algal cell walls , the modulus has been found to be 407 – 662 MPa for Chara corallina ( Toole et al . , 2001 ) and up to 4 GPa for Nitella opaca ( Probine and Preston , 1962 ) . Other than these relatively direct determinations , many investigators have also studied the mechanical properties of plant cell wall components or wall analogues . The modulus of individual cellulose microﬁbrils has been both measured and calculated ( Marho¨fer et al . , 1996 ; Ishikawa et al . , 1997 ) giving a modulus range of 0·7 – 3·5 GPa . These calculated values are close to those obtained from measurements made on cellulosic networks under uni - axial tensile conditions , e . g . moduli of 2·7 GPa for softwood ﬁbres at a relative humidity of 50 % ( Hamad , 1998 ) or 1 – 3 GPa for a cast network of sugar beet cellulose microﬁbrils ( Dufresne et al . , 1997 ) . By deforming cell wall analogues based on Acetobacter xylinus cellulose under equi - biaxial tension , moduli ranging from 200 MPa to 500 MPa have been obtained for a cellulose - only system ( Chanliaud et al . , 2002 ) . Overall , it appears that Young’s modulus estimated by the present method gives values that are reasonable compared with prior estimations on related materials . It should be noted that the value of Young’s modulus from model ﬁtting depends critically on the chosen value of the initial cell wall thickness , as also reported by Hiller et al . T ABLE 2 .

Indeed , the modulus is inversely proportional to wall thickness for given force - deformation data . Freeze fracture scanning electron micro - scopy was used to measure the wall thickness used in this study ( Blewett , 2000 ) , which should give a reliable value . However , it should be noted that not all of the cell wall is necessarily load - bearing . It may therefore be wisest to treat Eh 0 as one parameter combining modulus and wall thick - ness . This should be invariant for any set of data . Furthermore , it was necessary to use a mean value of the thickness , as measurements of thickness for speciﬁc cells are not possible during the compression experiment . Some possible effects of variations around the mean are shown in Table 4 . Using the pressure probe , measurements have been made of the instantaneous bulk modulus of elasticity , e , of single suspension tomato cells ( Tomos and Leigh , 1999 ; Hukin , 2002 ) . e i is deﬁned by : e i (cid:136) d P d V V (cid:133) 3 (cid:134) As the name and deﬁnition imply , e i is not an intrinsic material property of a cell as it depends on bulk parameters such as cell size . Nevertheless , it is possible to use the Young’s modulus found in the present work to estimate e i for the cells under test . Assuming linear elastic behaviour during pressure probe measurements , e i was estimated to be about 7 MPa . This value agrees very well with direct pressure probe measurements ( 5·9 – 7·1 MPa ; Hukin , 2002 ) . This is further validation of the present approach and the value of Young’s modulus determined here . This method for determining Young’s modulus of single undifferentiated plant cells has great potential for further studies , speciﬁcally in investigating how the elasticity of primary plant cell walls depends on their composition and structure , and environmental conditions . Table 5 shows some preliminary data obtained using the method , which show how Young’s modulus varies with pH . Although these data need proper interpretation , it is interesting to note that the optimum pH for expansin activity is between 3·5 and 4·5 ( McQueen - Mason et al . , 1992 ) , while at pH 4·5 Young’s modulus is lowest , i . e . the cell wall is least stiff . It is sometimes suggested that plant cell walls might be viscoelastic ( Preston , 1974 ) , although it is difﬁcult to separate water ﬂows and true viscoelasticity for tissue samples . Such time - dependent behaviour was not con - sidered here . The compression experiment is relatively fast , and creep and enzyme responses act on longer time - scales ( Haughton et al . , 1968 ; Cosgrove , 2000 b ) . By using additional techniques such as image analysis of cell shape , and different compression speeds , it may eventually be possible to use the compression experiment to investigate any true time - dependent behaviour , as well as measuring cell hydraulic conductivity directly . CONCLUSIONS Compressing cells by micromanipulation to obtain force - deformation data has been used widely to investigate the mechanical properties of cells , including single plant cells from suspension cultures ( Blewett et al . , 2000 ) . Normally it can only provide the bursting force and percentage deformation at bursting to characterize the mechanical properties of the cells . The intrinsic material properties of cell walls cannot be obtained directly from these compres - sion experiments . In this study , it was shown that a linear elastic model could be used to determine the Young’s modulus of single cultured tomato cell walls from micro - manipulation data . It was surprising how well this simple model ﬁtted the data . Because of the speed of the compression , it appears water loss due to cell permeability was not signiﬁcant . Although the Poisson’s ratio could not be determined , it seemed that Young’s modulus did not depend greatly on its value , and a reasonable value of the modulus was found . Combining the compression experiment with mathemat - ical modelling is a powerful method for investigating plant cell wall mechanics . It should be useful in determining how the elasticity and the strength of plant cell walls depend on their composition and structure , and how these change under different environmental conditions .

APPENDIX Theoretical analysis of cell compression For a linear elastic material , Cheng ( 1987 ) gives an expression for the generalized Hooke’s law strain energy function ( W ) . This is important as it can be used to identify the tensions in a cell wall , if this can be assumed to show linear elastic behaviour . In the case of a ( mechanical ) membrane , a simpliﬁed expression for W is given by eqn A1 , where bending and shear effects can be neglected . At any given compression , W (cid:136) Eh 0 2 (cid:133) 1 (cid:255) n 2 (cid:134) (cid:133) l 1 (cid:255) 1 (cid:134) 2 (cid:135) (cid:133) l 2 (cid:255) 1 (cid:134) 2 (cid:135) 2 n (cid:133) l 1 (cid:255) 1 (cid:134)(cid:133) l 2 (cid:255) 1 (cid:134) n o (cid:133) A1 (cid:134) where W is the strain energy per unit volume caused by deformation ; l 1 and l 2 are the principal stretch ratios , each deﬁned ( in a given direction ) as the ratio of the length of a small section of membrane after deformation , to its original length in the uninﬂated state . Subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the meridian and circumferential direction , respectively ( see Wang et al . — Mechanical Modelling of Tomato Cells 451 D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / aob / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 93 / 4 / 443 / 197237 b y gue s t on 1 2 S ep t e m be r 2018 Table 1 ) . E is the Young’s Modulus ; n is the Poisson’s ratio ; and h 0 is the initial wall thickness before inﬂation . It can be seen that the strain energy not only depends on the stretch ratios but also on the parameters E , n and h 0 . The tensions in the wall may be found from the strain energy function using eqn ( A2 ) , adapted from Skalak et al . ( 1973 ) . T i (cid:136) 1 l 1 l 2 @ W @ l i (cid:133) l i (cid:134) 2 (cid:133) A2 (cid:134) where T i is the tension in the i th direction with a stretch ratio l i . The tension – stretch relationships are therefore found by combining eqns ( A1 ) and ( A2 ) .

The contact region is where the cell wall touches the compression surfaces ( see Fig . 3C ) . The details of the derivation of these equations are given elsewhere ( Feng and Yang , 1973 ; Lardner and Pujara , 1980 ) . Only the ﬁnal equations are presented here . The independent variable in these equations is y , which relates the position of any point on the boundary of the cell back to the original position of that point in the inﬂated but uncompressed cell . y is the angular position of the point measured from the vertical axis of symmetry .

One boundary condition for this problem is y (cid:136) 0 ; l 1 (cid:136) l 2 (cid:133) A14 (cid:134) Other boundary conditions refer to the edge of the contact region , where it meets the non - contact region .

When all the boundary conditions have been satisﬁed , the model equations give corresponding values for P and h for 452 Wang et al . — Mechanical Modelling of Tomato Cells D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / aob / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 93 / 4 / 443 / 197237 b y gue s t on 1 2 S ep t e m be r 2018 given E , n , h 0 and l s . The force ( F ) and the deformation ( X ) can be obtained from P and h using the following equations : F (cid:136) P (cid:2) A c (cid:133) A20 (cid:134) where P is the ( turgor ) pressure inside the compressed cell at deformation X , and A c is the contact area between the cell and the probe surface .

If some of these parameters are pre - determined , ﬁtting of the model to the experimental data can be used to derive the others . This is described more fully below . Numerical simulation Since the original boundary - value problem has been transformed into an initial value problem , the governing equations ( eqns A5 to A7 and A13 ) , with their boundary conditions can be solved by the Runge – Kutta method , here using the Matlab ( MathWorks Inc . ) ode45 solver . As the constitutive relationship of the wall material is time - independent , the compression of the cell was solved as a series of static equilibrium problems following the calculation procedure of Liu et al . ( 1996 ) . In each step , the model simulates the displacement of the probe corres - ponding to the time between steps . The probe displacement deforms the cell from its previous shape . During the time taken for the step , there may be water loss , depending on the wall permeability . At the end of the step , the volume ( V ) of the deformed sphere is determined from the boundary coordinates of the cell ( r and h ; see Fig . 3C ) . V (cid:136) 2 p (cid:133) h 0 r 2 d h (cid:133) A22 (cid:134) For any boundary point , h can be found from eqn .

( 1996 ) , the pressure P in eqn ( A13 ) is adjusted at each step until the new volume V equals to the previous volume minus any water loss . When this is achieved , the force for a given simulated deformation is known ( eqns A20 and A21 ) .
