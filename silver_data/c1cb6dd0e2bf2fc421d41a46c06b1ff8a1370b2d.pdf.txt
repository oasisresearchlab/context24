Methods The expression of cortactin was detected using real - time ﬂuorescence quantitative PCR and immunohis - tochemical SP method in epithelial ovarian cancer . Results ( 1 ) The relative content of cortactin mRNA in epithelial ovarian cancer tissue was higher than that in benign control tissue , and expression was related to histo - logical classiﬁcation and FIGO stage . ( 2 ) Cortactin pro - tein was localized in the cytoplasm and membrane of tumor cells . The positive rate of cortactin was 73 . 3 % in epithelial ovarian cancer , and the rate of cor - tactin expression was related to histological classiﬁcation . ( 3 ) The average survival period of epithelial ovarian cancer patients with positive expression of cortactin was 19 . 5 ± 1 . 2 months ( 95 % CI 14 . 6 – 21 . 4 months ) , com - pared with 34 . 5 ± 4 . 3 months in the negative expression group ( 95 % CI 22 . 1 – 25 . 9 months ) . Univariate survival analysis showed that : negative expression of cortactin had a signiﬁcant survival advantage ( v 2 = 5 . 739 , P = 0 . 017 ) . A cox regression model for multivariate analysis revealed that cortactin was an independent prognostic factor for epithelial ovarian cancer ( P = 0 . 001 ; RR = 6 . 452 , 95 % CI 2 . 289 – 7 . 112 ) . Conclusions Negative expression of cortactin was an independent prognostic factor and had a survival advan - tage . This suggested that cells with poor differentiation showed increasing motility . Cortactin is closely related to poor prognosis . Keywords Cortactin (cid:2) Epithelial ovarian cancer (cid:2) Cell movement (cid:2) Prognosis Introduction Epithelial ovarian cancer has the highest mortality of all gynecological tumors [ 1 ] , with metastasis being the main cause of mortality . The process of metastasis has been viewed as a series of steps , including direct invasion , lymphatic metastasis , hematogenous dissemination , over - ﬂow , and implantation metastasis . From a genetic per - spective , the instability of cancer cells allows them to adapt to their new microenvironment , which includes ﬁber cells , immune cells , endothelial cells , and extracellular matrix changes [ 2 ] . Tumor cells released from organizational structures show increased motility [ 3 ] , and this motility and the consequent invasion and metastasis depend on the properties of the cells themselves [ 4 ] , which in turn depend on the structural characteristics of the cytoskeleton and the conduction of signals from the nucleus . The cortactin gene is located on chromosome 11q13 and cortactin protein is located on the cell surface or at the poles . Cortactin recruits Arp2 / 3 complex proteins to actin , causing actin nucleation and regulating actin cytoskeleton assembly and adhesion . It thus plays an important role in podocyte and lamellipodia formation , membrane transport , intracellular phagocytosis , & A .

Cortactin is a p80 / 85 protein ; the 85 - kDa subtype is a modiﬁcation of the 80 - kDa protein , which is involved in tumorigenesis . Materials and methods Patients and samples Seventy - ﬁve patients diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer underwent cytoreductive surgery at Liaocheng People’s Hospital between April 2009 and October 2013 . The patients were grouped according to age , cell differ - entiation , FIGO stage , lymph node metastasis , and ascites . Patient ranged from 30 to 66 years . There were 22 highly differentiated and 53 moderate – poorly differentiated tumors . Twenty - two were FIGO stage I – II and 53 were stage III – IV . Thirty patients had lymph node metastasis and 18 had ascites . None of the patients had any prior history of chemoradiation , radiation , or hormonal therapy . None of the patients had any contact with radiation , or any other risk factors , including smoking . None of the patients had histories of infectious hepatitis , autoimmune diseases , or other complications . The postoperative follow - up period continued until the date of death or December 2013 ( 2 – 54 months ) . During the same period , we also selected 40 patients with benign ovarian epithelial tumors who underwent surgery at Liaocheng People’s Hospital , and 20 perimenopausal control patients who underwent ovariec - tomy because of other diseases ( uterine ﬁbroids and other benign diseases ) . Fresh tissues were frozen rapidly in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80 (cid:3) C . Conventional specimens were ﬁxed in 10 % formalin and embedded in parafﬁn . Methods RNA extraction One hundred micrograms of tissue was homogenized with 1 ml Trizol reagent ( Invitrogen , USA ) in an ice bath and then transferred to a fresh tube . Chloroform ( 200 l l ) was added followed by shaking vigorously by hand for 30 s . The samples were then incubated on ice for 5 min and centrifuged at 4 (cid:3) C at 12 , 000 rpm for 10 min . The cleared homogenate was transferred to a fresh tube and insoluble material and the upper fat layer were discarded . Isopropyl alcohol ( 500 l l ) was added followed by mixing and incu - bation at room temperature for 10 min and centrifuging at 4 (cid:3) C at 12 , 000 rpm for 10 min . One milliliter of 75 % ethanol was added to the samples , which were then mixed . The precipitate was washed , centrifuged at 4 (cid:3) C at 7500 rpm for 5 min , the supernatant was discarded , and the RNA pellet was air - dried for 5 min before adding 20 l l RNase - free water and mixing by gentle pipetting . The purity and concentration were determined using a Nano - Drop2000 trace ultraviolet spectrophotometer ( Thermo Electron Corporation , USA ) and the RNA was stored at - 80 (cid:3) C until required . Real - time ﬂuorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction to detect Smad4 and cortactin Samples were incubated at 37 (cid:3) C for 60 min and the purity and concentration of the cDNA reverse transcription pro - duct were tested using a NanoDrop2000 trace ultraviolet spectrophotometer . cDNA was stored at - 80 (cid:3) C until required . Primers were designed according to the gene sequences of cortactin : upstream , 5 0 - GGATGGATAA GAATGCGTCAAC - 3 0 ; downstream , 5 0 - GTTACTTGTTT TGCTGGTCACAG - 3 0 . Primers used for GAPDH as an internal control were 5 0 - AGAAGGCTGGGGCTCATTTG - 3 0 , and 5 0 - AGGGGCCATCCACAGTCTTC - 3 0 ( Shanghai Sangon Biotech Co . Ltd , China ) . The cortactin real - time ﬂuorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) reaction conditions were as follows : 95 (cid:3) C predegeneration 15 min , 95 (cid:3) C transgender 10 s , 54 (cid:3) C annealing 20 s , 72 (cid:3) C extension 32 s , for 40 cycles . Dissolution curves were automatically generated to determine the speciﬁcities of both ampliﬁcation products . The CT value of the cDNA for each group sample was determined and the formula RQ = 2 - DD Ct was used to compare differences in gene expression between the cancer and control groups . Immunohistochemical staining of cortactin proteins Parafﬁn - embedded specimens were cut into 3 - to 4 - l m serial sections , incubated in a water bath at 37 (cid:3) C , allowed to ﬂatten , and incubated at 75 (cid:3) C for 30 min . The sections were then dewaxed in three xylene solutions for 10 min each and processed through 100 % ethanol for 2 min , followed by 95 , 80 , and 75 % ethanols for 1 min each . The sections were heated in a microwave for antigen repair in 0 . 01 mmol / l citrate salt buffer and cooled to room tem - perature . Peroxidase blocking solution was added followed by incubation at room temperature for 10 min , washing in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , incubation at room tem - perature for 10 min in non - immune animal serum , and removal of the serum . Primary antibodies to Smad4 and cortactin , respectively , were added at 4 (cid:3) C overnight , fol - lowed by washing with PBS . Secondary biotin - labeled antibodies were added and incubated at room temperature for 10 min and then washed in PBS . Streptomycin resis - tance - biotin peroxidase solution was added and incubated at room temperature for 10 min , followed by washing in PBS , addition of 3 , 3 0 - diaminobenzidine , counterstaining Clin Transl Oncol ( 2016 ) 18 : 220 – 227 221 123 with hematoxylin for 3 min , differentiation in hydrochloric acid solution , washing with PBS to reveal the blue color , and dehydration through graded alcohols . The slides were mounted and examined under a light microscope after drying . PBS solution was used in place of primary anti - bodies as a negative control . Positive staining was indicated by brown – yellow stain - ing around the cell membrane at high - power magniﬁcation . ‘‘ ? ’’ indicates [ 10 % of tumor cells with weak staining on the cell membrane , ‘‘ ? ? ’’ indicates [ 10 % of tumor cells with moderate staining on the cell membrane , and ‘‘ ? ? ? ’’ indicates [ 10 % of tumor cells with strong staining on the cell membrane . The results were judged by pathologists blinded to the slides’ origins . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 17 . 0 soft - ware ( SPSS , USA ) . Data were described as mean ± stan - dard deviation ( SD ) . Differences between groups were compared by single factor analysis of variance and t tests , and numerical data were compared using v 2 tests . Corre - lation analysis was performed using Spearman’s correla - tion and rank correlation analyses . The degree of correlation was judged based on the correlation coefﬁcient as follows : R \ 0 . 1 no correlation ; 0 . 1 – 0 . 39 low correla - tion ; 0 . 4 – 0 . 69 moderate correlation ; 0 . 7 – 0 . 99 high corre - lation . The Kaplan – Meier method was used to calculate survival curves , and differences were evaluated using the log - rank test . Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate the impact of clinicopathologic fac - tors and the expression of each marker on overall survival . Values of P \ 0 . 05 were considered signiﬁcant . Results Cortactin mRNA expression in ovarian tumor tissue Cortactin mRNA levels were higher in epithelial ovarian cancer tissues compared with benign control tissues ( Table 1 ; Fig . 1 ) . The formula RQ = 2 - DD Ct was used to calculate relative cortactin mRNA levels . Cortactin mRNA levels were 2 . 31 times higher in ovarian epithelial cancer tissue than in benign ovarian tumor tissue . The relationship of cortactin mRNA expression in ovarian epithelial carcinoma tissues with clinical pathological features We next investigated the correlation between cortactin mRNA expression and the clinicopathological characteris - tics of the ovarian epithelial carcinoma , including age , his - tologic classiﬁcation , FIGO staging , lymph node metastasis , and ascites . As shown in Table 2 , we found that cortactin mRNA expression was signiﬁcantly different in patients Table 1 Cortactin mRNA expression in ovarian tumor tissue Gene Group CT value D CT DD CT P Cortactin Epithelial ovarian cancer 21 . 8378 ± 1 . 0992 0 . 9698 ± 0 . 6648 Ovarian benign epithelial tumors 23 . 1136 ± 0 . 2929 2 . 1836 ± 0 . 9901 - 1 . 2054 0 . 000 Normal ovarian tissue 23 . 5671 ± 0 . 7082 3 . 0268 ± 0 . 4577 - 2 . 0570 0 . 000 GAPDH Epithelial ovarian cancer 20 . 8679 ± 0 . 8598 Ovarian benign epithelial tumors 20 . 9384 ± 0 . 0733 Normal ovarian tissue 20 . 5401 ± 0 . 3860 Fig . 1 Ovarian carcinoma tissue cortactin mRNA ampliﬁcation and dissolve curve 222 Clin Transl Oncol ( 2016 ) 18 : 220 – 227 123 with different histological classiﬁcation and FIGO stage ( high differentiation vs low differentiation 1 . 5245 ± 0 . 4596 vs 0 . 7396 ± 0 . 5996 , respectively , p \ 0 . 001 ; I – II period vs III – IV period 1 . 2878 ± 0 . 7869 vs 0 . 8378 ± 0 . 5643 , respectively , p \ 0 . 05 ) . There was no signiﬁcant association between the cortactin mRNA expression and other clinico - pathological characteristics ( p [ 0 . 05 ) . Cortactin expression in ovarian tumor tissue Cortactin was localized in the cytoplasm and membrane of tumor cells . The positivity rate for cortactin was signiﬁ - cantly higher ( 73 . 30 % ) in epithelial ovarian cancer com - pared with benign ovarian tumor tissue ( \ 25 % ) ( P \ 0 . 05 ) ( Table 3 ; Fig . 2a , b ) . The expression of cortactin and the correlation with clinical pathological features of epithelial ovarian cancer As shown in Table 4 , we found that the expression of cortactin was signiﬁcantly different in patients with high differentiation ( 20 / 22 , 90 . 91 % ) and low differentiation ( 35 / 53 , 66 . 04 , v 2 = 4 . 918 , p \ 0 . 05 ) , but not age , FIGO stage , ascites , or lymph node metastasis ( p [ 0 . 05 ) . The analysis of the relationship between the expression level of cortactin in ovarian epithelial carcinoma with clinical pathological characteristics and survival prognosis Among 75 cases of ovarian epithelial cancer , 55 cases were positive for cortactin protein expression , and had an aver - age survival period of 19 . 5 ± 1 . 2 months ( 95 % CI 14 . 6 – 21 . 4 months ) , and 20 cases were cortactin - negative , with an average survival of 34 . 5 ± 4 . 3 months ( 95 % CI 22 . 1 – 25 . 9 months ) ( P = 0 . 017 ) ( Fig . 3 ) , cortactin showed the opposite effect ( v 2 = 5 . 739 , P = 5 . 739 ) . Single factor survival analysis showed that patients with high differen - tiation , early stage , and no lymph node metastasis or ascites had a survival advantage ( Table 5 ) . Cox regression analysis to investigate the independent prognostic factors for ovarian cancer patients We analyzed the factors correlated with patient survival using Cox’s proportional hazards regression model . The following factors were identiﬁed as independent prognostic factors in ovarian epithelial cancer : FIGO grade ( P = 0 . 036 , RR = 1 . 460 , 95 % CI 1 . 030 – 2 . 160 ) , histo - logical grade ( P = 0 . 019 , RR = 0 . 581 , 95 % CI 0 . 481 – 0 . 932 ) , lymph node metastasis ( P = 0 . 010 , RR = 2 . 436 , 95 % CI 1 . 218 – 4 . 500 ) , cortactin expression ( P = 0 . 001 , RR = 6 . 452 , 95 % CI 2 . 289 – 7 . 112 ) ( Table 5 ) . Discussion Cell movement is a universal phenomenon involving organelle movement and cell membrane movement . The mechanochemical cytoskeletal system is the source of the active movement force . Many cytoskeletal proteins are involved in cell movement , and the newly discovered actin - bundling protein fascin , and the actin - ﬁlament - bind - ing protein cortactin play important roles in the regulation of cell active movement .

The gaps in the cortactin network are only about 0 . 1 nm , preventing the passage of some organelles and macromolecules . The plasma membrane constitutes the most active structure in the cell . Cell movement and many other important physiological activities , such as changes in cell shape , cell adhesion , endocytosis , cytokinesis , trans - membrane protein composition , and cell surface tension involve the cortactin cytoskeleton . Cortactin regulates the actin cytoskeleton through cell movement , adhesion , polarization , and shrinkage . It is a substrate of Src tyrosine kinase [ 6 ] , and plays key roles in the cytoskeleton and in reconstruction of signal pathways . A biochemical study showed that cortactin promoted migration via phosphorylation , to regulate cell movement [ 7 ] . The cytoskeleton and its regulatory proteins are critical for the migration of tumor cells , and changing the cytoskeleton causes migration . The invasion and meta - static abilities of the tumor cells are closely related to cell movement . The structural characteristics of the cytoskeleton are responsible for caused the different capacities of cells to move , and this in turn reﬂects speciﬁc genetic difference between tumor and normal cells . The study found that some epithelial cells lost their epithelial morphology and characteristics , and acquired the morphology and characteristics of mesenchymal cells , along with motility . This transformation is known as epithelial – mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) .

EMT is an important biological process in the migration and invasion of malignant tumors of epithelial origin . Tumor cells are found in the extracellular matrix after EMT , which is hydrolyzed by proteolytic enzymes such as MMP . Tumor cells are released into the systemic circulation , spread to distant organs , and form secondary tumors . EMT is regarded as the key step in tumor invasion . EMT is important for the invasion and metastasis of epithelial tumor cells , which acquire the characteristics of stem cells . Cortactin may be a key gene in the processes of tumor invasion and metastasis . Tumor cell lines overex - pressing cortactin demonstrate strong transfer ability . The results of the current study conﬁrmed that cortactin was localized in the cytoplasm and cell membrane , and that cortactin expression levels were signiﬁcantly higher in ovarian epithelial cancer compared with benign ovarian tumors . Cortactin expression was positively related to histological classiﬁcation . These results suggest that the migratory ability of tumor cells is responsible for their invasive and metastatic characteristics . The most obvious characteristics of malignant tumors are proliferation and metastasis . Tumor initiation and progression are complicated processes , in which tumor cell migration is a basic condition . Each stage of tumor metastasis requires tumor cell movement , and tumor cells rely mainly on active movement to achieve invasion and metastasis via a variety of signaling pathway . Cancer cell movement is an essential feature of cancer cell migration , including pseudopodial extension of the cell membrane , membrane ﬂuidity , and cell - polarity changes [ 8 , 9 ] . One of the most important conditions for cancer cell invasion is the formation of invadopodia [ 10 ] . Artym [ 11 ] proposed a four - stage model of invadopodia formation . Cortactin initially aggregates and adheres to the membrane matrix ; MT1 - MMP then accumulates where the cortactin has gathered ; the extracellular matrix is degraded ; and cortactin regulates the secretion of MMPs ( mainly MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 and MT1 - MMP ) [ 12 ] . Cortactin may become phosphorylated by Erk1 / Erk2 , Src family kinases and PAK [ 5 ] . Cortactin regulates cell invasion and migration into the extracellular matrix through invadopodia in vivo . Invadopodia formation requires the polymerization G - actin to form F - actin [ 13 ] . Cortactin promotes the formation of Arp2 / 3 complexes and the nucleation of branched actin . Overexpression of cortactin thus induces cell motility and metastasis , inhibits intercellular adhesion , and accelerates the spread of tumors [ 14 , 15 ] .

Cortactin might thus be a sensitive marker of intrahepatic metastasis in HCC [ 16 ] . About 44 % of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas overexpress cortactin , and its expression was shown to be positively related TNM stage and histological differentiation . Increased cortactin expression correlated with increased local recurrence rate and reduced 5 - year survival [ 17 ] . The current results conﬁrmed that cortactin mRNA levels were signiﬁcantly higher in epithelial ovarian cancer tissue compared with benign control tissue , and expression levels were related to histological classiﬁcation and FIGO stage , while cortactin protein was expressed in 73 . 3 % of epithelial ovarian cancer tissues and was related to histo - logical classiﬁcation . Univariate survival analysis showed that negative cortactin expression conferred a survival advantage , while multivariate analysis identiﬁed negative cortactin expression as an independent prognostic factor . These results suggest that the malignant phenotype was associated with cortactin . TGF b 1 is a multifunctional cytokine able to induce the occurrence of EMT and apoptosis in some epithelial cells . TGF - b 1 can reduce the intracellular storage protein ferritin heavy chain , release iron stored in ferritin heavy chain , and increase the intracellular labile iron pool . Expression of TGF - b 1 is high in most tumor tissues and plasma [ 18 ] . Expression of TGF - b 1 is increased in eso - phageal squamous cell carcinoma , which is negatively correlated with E - cadherin , but positively with vimentin . This indicates that TGF - b 1 promotes EMT . When the TGF - b 1 signaling pathway is inhibited in esophageal squamous carcinoma cell line EC9706 , EMT is blocked . Smad4 is a cellular signal transduction protein that is a key component of TGF - b 1 signal transduction pathways . Abnormal expression and phosphorylation of Smad4 leads to disturbance of TGF - b 1 . The loss or mutation of Smad4 expression is closely related to tumor occurrence and development . The TGF - b 1 signaling pathways might reg - ulate tumor cell movement through cytoskeletal proteins controlled by Smad4 , and affect tumor cell invasion and metastasis . Silencing of Smad4 in pancreatic cancer by RNA interference ( RNAi ) affected TGF - b downstream genomic activity and multiple cell functions , such as movement , cytoskeleton regulation , cell cycle regulation , nuclear transport , and oxidation damage . Stimulation of Smad4 - silenced cells with TGF - b 1 upregulated ﬁve motility genes . These results indicate that inhibition of Smad4 expression might inﬂuence tumor cell movement . In addition to changes in tumor cell shape , cytoskeletal proteins are also upregulated during the process of metastasis [ 19 , 20 ] . Transfection of hepatoma SMMC - 7721 cells with RNAi - Smad lentivirus vector alters cell migration by the method of cell scratch and three - dimensional culture detection of cells . The results indicate that scratch wound healing time is faster in RNAi - Smad4 - 2 and RNAi - Smad4 - 12 transfected cells , and fascin and cortactin protein expression is higher . This shows that decreased expression of Smad4 upregulates the level of fascin and cortactin , and promotes the migration of hepatoma SMMC - 7721 cells . Cortactin is an F - actin - binding protein that regulates cell movement and the adhesive junction assembly . However , the function of cortactin in EMT remains elu - sive . Here , we found that during TGF - b 1 - induced EMT , cortactin underwent tyrosine dephosphorylation . Inhibition of the dephosphorylation of cortactin blocked TGF - b 1 - induced EMT . Knockdown of cortactin by RNAi decreased expression of intercellular junction proteins E - cadherin and ZO - 1 and induced expression of ﬁ - bronectin . Additionally , knockdown of cortactin further promoted TGF - b 1 - induced EMT , as shown by EMT markers and cell morphological changes . Moreover , a migration assay showed that cortactin knockdown pro - moted the migration and enhanced TGF - b 1 - induced migration [ 21 ] . The TGF - b 1 signal transduction pathway might regulate cytoskeletal protein by Smad4 . Cortactin might be a downstream target gene in the Smad4 pathway . Tumor cell movement is regulated via the Smad4 – cortactin pathway , which promotes tumor cell proliferation . In TGF - b path - way , Smad protein and cortactin are part of a tumor sup - pressor pathway . Any abnormal signal transduction can lead to disruption of the whole pathway . Tumor cells can escape the inhibitory effect of TGF - b 1 , and accelerate the proliferation , inﬁltration and metastasis of malignant tumor cells . The Smad4 – cortactin motor pathway might have potential therapeutic value . In conclusion , expression of cortactin in epithelial ovar - ian cancer was signiﬁcantly higher than in the control group . High expression of cortactin occurred mainly in poorly differentiated and late - stage cancer . Higher levels of cor - tactin expression were related to poorer differentiation , greater tumor cell motility , and greater malignancy . Cor - tactin expression in epithelial ovarian carcinoma was closely related to malignant biological behavior . Because the migration rate was determined by the movement ability of the tumor cells , up - regulation of cortactin as an important cytoskeletal protein was closely related to poor prognosis in ovarian cancer .
