Most of this research has focused on design aspects for the elderly and the usage of technology for physical rehabilitation purposes . Less work has been carried out dealing with cherishing . Due to health problems or decreased mobility , older adults are especially vulnerable and are more likely to be - come socially isolated . In this paper , we propose an approach for participating in society by sharing knowledge that is cherished . Our work contributes to a growing body of literature concerned with making use of technology for older adults . With the current paper , we focus on older adults as content providers to enhance their self - esteem as valuable members of society . We address this by proposing an application to share recipes across generations . The idea behind is that knowing how to prepare food is often for - gotten from one generation to the next , especially when families ∗ Both authors contributed equally to this research .

Still , food is not only seen as a mean to ful ￿ l a basic need but also as a mean for community , sharing , indulgence and experience . Thus it seems to be obvious to use food preparation as a topic for cherishing and sharing . We make use of approaches from researchers from ￿ elds such as designing accessible systems for older adults [ 2 ] , participatory design [ 17 ] and older adults as content producers [ 28 ] . This paper and the development approach follows the Human - Centered Design process , hence we present the current results of an iterative development . First , we review relevant literature to gain insights regarding social isolation and the use of digital means for the overall aim to reduce isolation for the target user group of older adults . 2 SOCIAL ISOLATION According to [ 24 ] a way to decrease the feeling of social isolation and loneliness is to participate in meaningful and productive social activities , for instance , to help people in need . They argue that such a behaviour could result in an increasing self - esteem regarding the social identity of a person . The study of Amagasa et al . shows the bene ￿ ts of community involvement to improve mental health [ 1 ] . 2 . 1 Preventing Social Isolation with IT Some research was made on promoting social abilities of older adults using technology . For example , Chen and Schulz [ 4 ] argue in their meta - study review that ICT use for older adults could be an e ￿ ective tool to reduce their perceived social isolation . Wallbaum et al . [ 27 ] suggest StoryBox as a tool for enhancing the relationship between grandparents and grandchildren . Their study shows that the grandparents were motivated to use the system , though not be - ing very a ￿ liated with technology beforehand . Using a printer - like device Lee et al . [ 16 ] designed a digital inbox to increase communi - cation frequency between family members , especially grandparents and grandchildren . Judges [ 11 ] studied InTouch to derive patterns of use , factors to adopt the system and the e ￿ ect on the socioemotional well - being . Their ￿ ndings show that ease - of - use and motivation to communicate with others is a key factor for success . Based on their results they argue that learning a new device , app or feature is bene ￿ cial for the emotional well - being through enjoyment and increased self - e ￿ cacy . 2 . 2 Technology adoption When presenting new systems one of the ￿ rst things to be discussed is technology acceptance . Having older adults in mind that seems to be even more true , as the technology respective the underlying model to be used is often new . The described projects and stud - ies in the last section have in common that a key success factor for the projects in terms of acceptance is the added - value older adults expect . However , dealing with older adults this view has Session 8 : Accessibility & Ethics 455 MuC’20 , September 6 – 9 , 2020 , Magdeburg , Germany Gabriela Tullius and Gamze Dogan to be enhanced . For example [ 18 ] identify the bene ￿ t of usage and motivating further usage as two relevant aspects for older adults to use a digital system . However , the feeling of motivation can be overwhelmed by a feeling of fear failing to use the system or technology [ 29 ] . Lee et al . [ 15 ] derive from a survey of related studies 10 factors as facilitators or determinants of older adults’ adoption of technology : value , usability , a ￿ ordability , accessibility , technical support , social support , emotion , independence , experience and con ￿ dence [ 15 ] . 2 . 3 Restrictions and barriers Numerous researchers have researched into barriers of older adults using computers . Both cognitive and physical challenges have been identi ￿ ed [ 20 ] , [ 25 ] . As the elderly form a target group that is often a ￿ ected by disabilities , many restrictions for the system are caused by the needs of the elderly . Therefore when developing mobile applications , visual , auditory , tactile and cognitive limitations of the elders need to be taken into consideration [ 5 ] . Recognizing user interface objects such as symbols is challenging [ 12 ] . Cognitive im - pairments should be taken into account , e . g . as factors like speed of processing information , multi - tasking and concentration ability are decreasing , unnecessary stimuli like animations should be avoided . 3 PRECREC : PRECIOUS RECIPE For the prototype development we followed the Human - Centered Design Process . From a general point of view , the user’s goal is to receive appreciation . Following a needs - based approach we use the categories connecting with people , expressing oneself and meeting a challenge as a base to promote a positive experience as suggested by Fronemann et al . [ 6 ] . They assume that the identi ￿ ed themes can be linked to user needs such as Relatedness , Stimulation and Competence [ 6 ] . We follow this approach and use these needs as a basis for our development . Within the analysis phase four types of de ￿ nition of ages were identi ￿ ed : • Sociologicalperspective , characterizedbylesssocialcontacts , e . g . through retirement . • Mental model , PCs , WWW , smartphones and social media have been around for at least a decade and therefore people who are now in their 70s are likely to have experienced some form of IT during their work - life thus forming a mental model of its behaviour . • Calenderial , " real " age depending on the year of birth . • Biological age , depending on the ￿ tness of the individual user . The current work uses a sociological and calendrical perspective with a focus on older adults that have retired and live apart from their children . 3 . 1 Scenario 3 . 1 . 1 Proto - Persona . Forthedevelopmentofthescenario , weworked out Proto - Personas , such as ( in brief ) : Helga Buhl , 65 years , lives in a village and is a retired teacher . She has two sons living further away . As she hasn’t got a driving license , she is limited in her social life . She uses a smartphone and messaging apps to be in touch with her family . She loves cooking , however preparing food for herself is not as satisfying as to cook for a family . Her family loves her food , too . Helga would like to have more valuable conversations , not just reduced to weather forecasts . Just documenting her recipes doesn’t seem meaningful to her , however , when one of her family members asks for an old family recipe or tip , she is keen to help . 3 . 1 . 2 Recipe documentation . Recipes for preparing food are mainly shared in three ways - by experiencing , by audio or visual explana - tions or in a written form . All have in common that the process of preparing the food is somehow structured . To understand better the context of documenting a recipe , we analyzed a number of recipe resources . As we deal with older adults we took older cookbooks from 1934 till 1960 [ 22 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 7 ] into account to identify similari - ties and di ￿ erences in recipe documentation to modern ones like [ 8 ] and recipe collections online like Chefkoch . It was remarkable that in older recipes , illustrations were hardly found , but kitchen techniques , historical information or tips for the household were included . On the contrary in modern versions nutrition factors , preparing times and portions were listed . Online recipe collections are more detailed , use categorizing and the like , generally speaking using the added - value of digital technology . This analysis lead to a usage scenario creating a recipe with eight steps : naming , option for illustrations , notes , category , portions , timing , ingredients and preparation . 3 . 1 . 3 Recipe exchange . For our scenario , we took into account that information can be exchanged in various ways , e . g . written or audio - visual . The exchange of information needs two contacts . For security reasons we only allow known contacts to get in touch with each other . Technically spoken a second way of exchanging information is therefore necessary to exchange some kind of token for identi ￿ cation , for instance in person or via another medium like EMail . For the development of the prototype , we take this as given . 3 . 1 . 4 Design Rationale . One thing we recognized during research is that little is said about the quality of the relationship . Researchers use a quantitative measurement like the number of exchanged artefacts or frequency . Our approach per se takes the quality into account as the exchanged information is valuable and important - for both sides . Following literature , a fully clickable mockup with a touchable interface using Adobe XD has been developed . Touch interfaces seem to be favourable when designing for older adults [ 19 ] , [ 14 ] . It has been decided to use tablets because in the age group of over 55 years smartphones are only used by 26 % whereas 74 % use tablets or PCs [ 23 ] plus studies show high acceptance of tablets [ 3 ] . For the design , we followed recommendations resulting from studies e . g . by [ 2 ] , [ 9 ] and [ 14 ] . 4 ITERATIVE DESIGN For the development of PrecRec two pre - studies in a workshop format were conducted . The aim of the ￿ rst pre - study , a two - day workshop , was to con ￿ rm the Proto - Persona and the usage scenar - ios . The ￿ rst day was primarily for building trust , understanding the model of the older adults for food preparation including shop - ping . On the second day a fully clickable mockup was presented and discussed ( see Figure 1 left ) . 4 . 0 . 1 Workshop 1 . The workshop was conducted with four per - sons ( between 55 and 79 years old ) , living in a retirement home in Session 8 : Accessibility & Ethics 456 PrecRec : Supporting Older Adults Sharing Recipes MuC’20 , September 6 – 9 , 2020 , Magdeburg , Germany Germany . One of the subjects had to leave the workshop early so that only three conducted the whole . We interviewed the subjects to research details on their social status , communication habits and interest in cooking . All of them were in touch with children , grandchildren or godchildren using various technologies . Two of the three have been asked for recipes by family members . Show - ing the mockup revealed that the subjects found several functions like adding photos , categories or notes unnecessary . This reaction was kind of expected as these functions were not present in older cookbooks , either . Two of the subjects had di ￿ culties using touch due to limited skin conductance , still , they found it very intuitive to click on the user interface element for triggering certain functions . Generally speaking , the subjects liked the idea and design . Some of symbols and labels weren’t understood , e . g . text message , the trash symbol for deleting , a pencil for editing and the symbol for sharing . Therefore a second workshop was conducted to ￿ nd more appropriate symbols . 4 . 0 . 2 Workshop 2 . The second workshop was conducted with three other persons of the target user ( age 63 , 64 , 77 ) . Beside the Mockup , they were shown the symbols on paper as in Figure 1 right and were asked about their ￿ rst thoughts . The idea was to follow a ￿ rst - click paradigm . In a second step they were asked to choose a symbol for sending , editing , recording and deleting and to add it to a corresponding post - it . Figure 1 : First Mockup and Low - ￿ delty prototyp for sym - bols . 4 . 0 . 3 Modifications . According to the outcome of the two work - shops a number of modi ￿ cations were made : e . g . misunderstood symbols changed , noti ￿ cation message for recipe request made clearer and a number of help functions as tooltips added to reduce anxiety to make a mistake . Figure 2 shows the original version of the Mockup and the modi ￿ ed version . 4 . 1 Implementation for proof of concept The ￿ nal system has been developed as a progressive web app . This way it is platform independent and though intended for tablet , it could be used by any supported browser on a PC . 5 EVALUATION Corresponding to the overall aim of this work , the purpose of the evaluation of the system was to ￿ nd out technology readiness and UX aspects like the pragmatic and hedonic quality . For the general setup and environment recommendations by [ 26 ] were followed . A pilot test was conducted to eliminate obvious problems . Figure 2 : Mockup and modi ￿ ed version For each subject approx . 20 minutes were planned . The study was conducted with ￿ ve persons ( two female , three male ) between 61 and 77 ( mean age 66 . 2 years ) . After an introduction to the goals of the study and ethic issues like explaining and ￿ lling out the informed consent form , the subjects were asked to perform six tasks with the help of the system . The tasks had two categories : creating and editing recipes and dealing with recipe requests and messages in terms of sharing . The subjects were asked to think - aloud as they were watched by a study leader . As the evaluation was conducted with older adults , questions during the sessions were allowed [ 26 ] . Three of the six tasks had an explicit aspect of relatedness ( e . g . reacting to recipe requests ) to get feedback on the idea of acting as content providers and self - esteem . After the tasks , the subjects were asked to ￿ ll in a questionnaire . For this questionnaire the User Experience Questionnaire ( UEQ ) [ 10 ] and the Technology Commitment ( ZIS TB ) [ 21 ] were used . With the UEQ the attractiveness in terms of pragmatic and hedonic quality can be measured , the ZIS TB consists of three categories , asking about technology commitment as a measure of technology readiness . For the current evaluation , the indicators technology acceptance and technology competence were used . Beside getting qualitative feedback via thinking - aloud , a feedback round at the end of the evaluations gave insights . 5 . 1 Findings and Discussion All subjects worked on the given tasks however with various suc - cess . Two of the ￿ ve subjects could ful ￿ l the tasks without any help at all . One subject only succeeded with two tasks . Looking at the self - assessment this person stated the lowest value . 5 . 1 . 1 Technology commitment . For the ￿ rst part technology accep - tance on a scale from 1 ( not at all ) to 5 ( absolutely ) the answers result in a mean of ¯ ta = 4 . 25 ( standard deviation   = 0 . 61 ) . This means that most subjects had a positive opinion towards using new technology . The mean value for the technology competence is ¯ tc = 3 . 2 (   = 1 . 08 ) . The items of this second scale are opposite to technology acceptance . Hence , most of the subjects felt less compe - tent using new technology . In spite of accepting new technology , competence seems to be a big issue . 5 . 1 . 2 UEQ . The UEQ consists of 26 items grouped into pragmatic and hedonic quality . The overall attractiveness ( 1 . 53 ) is rated well above average according to [ 10 ] , the pragmatic quality with 1 . 7 and Session 8 : Accessibility & Ethics 457 MuC’20 , September 6 – 9 , 2020 , Magdeburg , Germany Gabriela Tullius and Gamze Dogan the hedonic quality with 0 . 95 . Subjects found it easy and under - standable to use , however from a hedonic perspective the originality with a mean value of 0 . 3 was below average ( see Figure 3 ) . This result needs more investigation , e . g . how can we cope with anxiety and technology competence versus expectations of innovative user interfaces ? Figure 3 : UEQ Results 5 . 1 . 3 Comments . The comments of four of the ￿ ve subjects were all very positive . They found the system easy to use , motivating and they would like to use it in the future . As other research has shown , using speech as input instead of typing was found very bene ￿ cial . Positive remarks were made on the simple screen design . As in the ￿ rst workshop , the subjects liked the idea to exchange recipes . Remarks like " I can be of help " were made and proofed our overall concept . Anxiety using new technology seems to be a major in ￿ uential factor for older adults . The current work suggests that there is a gap between technology readiness , competence and expectations users have using such systems . 5 . 2 Limitations Our research is still ongoing and we are aware that the results are based on a small sample and not over a long time span and therefore have to be interpreted with caution . What is still open is the e ￿ ect when real communication partners like grandchildren are involved . From a UX and Usability point of view , the application aims at older adults . In the current work the communication with family members was simulated , as a version for younger people was not in focus . Last but not least we have used measurements for evaluation that were not specially designed for older adults . Nevertheless , our ￿ ndings support research as suggested by [ 15 ] to take a broader perspective on developing products for older adults . 6 CONCLUSION We worked with a total of 11 older adults taking into account their ideas and feedback . Especially in the ￿ rst phase , this was very helpful to get the concept right . The results of the evaluation show that the system is appreciated and usable , even for people with limited technical competences . However much more work is needed on a longer time scale .
