Fundamental to this is a stretch of twenty nucleotides at the 5 ’ end of a guide RNA that provides specificity to the bound Cas9 endonuclease . Since a sequence of twenty nucleotides can occur multiple times in a given genome and some mismatches seem to be accepted by the CRISPR / Cas9 complex , an efficient and reliable in silico selection and evaluation of the targeting site is key prerequisite for the experimental success . Here we present the CRISPR / Cas9 target online predictor ( CCTop , http : / / crispr . cos . uni - heidelberg . de ) to overcome limitations of al - ready available tools . CCTop provides an intuitive user interface with reasonable default pa - rameters that can easily be tuned by the user . From a given query sequence , CCTop identifies and ranks all candidate sgRNA target sites according to their off - target quality and displays full documentation . CCTop was experimentally validated for gene inactivation , non - homologous end - joining as well as homology directed repair . Thus , CCTop provides the bench biologist with a tool for the rapid and efficient identification of high quality target sites . Introduction Targeted genome editing has become available to literally all ( model ) organisms with the emer - gence of engineered nucleases like transcription activator - like effector nucleases ( TALEN ) [ 1 ] , Zinc - finger nucleases ( ZFN ) [ 2 ] or the RNA guided nucleases [ 3 ] facilitating the introduction of a double strand break ( DSB ) at any locus of choice [ 4 – 9 ] . For targeted genome editing the c lustered r egularly i nterspaced s hort p alindromic r epeats ( CRISPR ) / CRISPR associated 9 ( Cas9 ) system , initially discovered as ‘ immune response ’ in ar - chaea and bacteria , has rapidly evolved as the tool of choice [ 10 – 12 ] . A single guide RNA ( sgRNA ) provides specificity and targets the Cas9 endonuclease to introduce a DSB at the site determined by the sgRNA [ 3 ] . A target sequence is characterized by a stretch of twenty nucleo - tides followed by a p rotospacer a djacent m otif ( PAM ; NRG in case of Cas9 ) [ 13 ] .

The funders had no role in study design , data collection and analysis , decision to publish , or preparation of the manuscript . straightforward design criteria , targeting of any locus in a given genome appears feasible . How - ever , since a stretch of twenty nucleotides can occur multiple times in a given genome and some mismatches seem to be accepted by the CRISPR / Cas9 system [ 3 , 13 – 15 ] , an efficient and reliable in silico selection and evaluation of the targeting site is key prerequisite for the experimental success . To this end , already a number of online sgRNA target finding and evaluation tools like CRISPR Design [ 13 ] , E - CRISP [ 16 ] or CHOPCHOP [ 17 ] have been presented . For the selec - tion of target sites they all have their individual strengths and limitations . In particular some run on restrictive sets of parameters , take too few mismatches into account for off - target search , lack full documentation about potential off - target sites , or have a limited list of target genomes . To provide the bench biologist with a tool for the rapid and efficient identification of high quality target sites , we have combined the strengths and overcome the limitations in the newly developed C RISPR / C as9 T arget o nline p redictor ( CCTop ) . We provide a growing range of model system genomes that can be analyzed via an intuitive graphical user interface for data entry . The output presents all the relevant information at a glance . CCTop has a reasonable number of options to provide the beginner with a list of top candidates ( and the corresponding oligonucleotide sequences for cloning ) and the expert with flexible options and a complete doc - umentation . Thus , the user is well informed for selecting the target site of choice . Here we pres - ent CCTop as an experimentally validated system for the rapid selection of high quality target sites for gene inactivation , non - homologous end - joining as well as homology directed repair . Materials and Methods CCTop CCTop is a web tool composed of html pages and CGI scripts ( http : / / crispr . cos . uni - heidelberg . de ) . The main processing steps are implemented in python ( S1 Fig ) . Off - target search The search of off - target sites is carried out using Bowtie [ 18 ] version 0 . 12 . 7 . Advantage has been taken of the seed used by Bowtie to search for matches and was linked to our definition of the sgRNA core plus the PAM . However prior to Bowtie based alignment , the sgRNA target se - quence has to be reverse complemented as a prerequisite of Bowtie ’ s alignment procedure , which only starts at the 5 ’ end . With this modification Bowtie is invoked with the following pa - rameters : - a , - n < core mismatches + 1 > , - l < core length > , - e < total mismatches (cid:1) 30 + 30 > and — y . Subsequently , the output from Bowtie is parsed and only alignments including a prop - er PAM are listed . Off - target mismatch score For each off - target site of any sgRNA a score is computed that indicates the likelihood of a sta - ble sgRNA / DNA heteroduplex . Based on experimental evidence this likelihood decreases the closer the mismatch is to the PAM [ 13 – 15 ] . This finding is quantified according to the follow - ing formula score off (cid:3) target ¼ X mismatch 1 : 2 pos ; where pos is the position of each mismatch , counted from the 5 ’ end . The base of the power ex - pression was determined empirically .

Assignment of closest gene to off - target sites To handle the files containing the exon coordinates for each organism ( bed files ) , the python li - brary bx - python ( https : / / bitbucket . org / james _ taylor / bx - python / ) is used and the BedInterval class is extended . Only exons closer than 100kb to the predicted off - target sites are assigned , otherwise “ NA ” is given as output . If target site and exon coordinates overlap , the distance is assigned to 0 . For each species the coordinates and the corresponding gene name and identifier of anno - tated exons are obtained from ENSEMBL ( version 77 ) [ 19 ] using the BioMart interface . For medaka , additional genes were included based on RNA - seq data from different embryonic stages ( unpublished data ) . sgRNA target site score The list of sgRNA target sites is ranked according to the number of predicted off - target sites and their potential deleterious effects on the respective off - target gene . The ranking is based on a single score that combines the number of off - target sites , the distribution of their mismatches and the distance to the closest annotated exon . This score is defined by the following equation : score ¼ X off (cid:3) targets log 10 ð dist Þ þ score off target total off targets (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:3) total off targets ; where dist is the distance of each off - target site to the corresponding closest exon . For this score only off - target sites with an associated exon are considered . Ethics Statement All fish are maintained in closed stocks at Heidelberg University . Medaka ( Oryzias latipes ) hus - bandry and experiments were performed according to local animal welfare standards ( Tierschutzgesetz § 11 , Abs . 1 , Nr . 1 , husbandry permit number 35 – 9185 . 64 / BH Wittbrodt and mutagenesis permit number G - 206 / 09 ) and in accordance with European Union animal wel - fare guidelines . The fish facility is under the supervision of the local representative of the ani - mal welfare agency . Embryos of medaka of the wildtype Cab strain were used at stages prior to hatching . Medaka were raised and maintained as described previously [ 20 ] . Lines used in the study were medaka wildtype Cab and Wimbledon - / + [ 21 ] . sgRNA target site selection With CCTop , sgRNA target sites ( pattern : N20NGG , core length = 12 , max . core mis - matches = 2 , max . total mismatches = 4 ) were selected according to their best hit / least off - tar - get . For efficient in vitro transcription from the T7 promoter , GG is necessary at the 5 ’ end of the respective sgRNAs . If not contained in the genomic target sequence , CCTop offers either extension or substitution of the most 5 ’ nucleotide ( s ) of the suggested primers [ 7 , 8 ] for sgRNA cloning ( small g ) to yield the 5 ’ leading GG necessary for in vitro transcription : sgRNA - 1 target site ( eGFP ) 5 ’ - GGCGAGGGCGATGCCACCTACGG - 3 ’ , sgRNA - 2 target site ( cryaa ) 5 ’ - GGTCAGGGTCAGCAGTCCATCGG - 3 ’ , sgRNA - 3 target site ( rx2 ) 5 ’ - GCATTTGTCAATGGA TACCCTGG - 3 ’ and sgRNA - 4 target site ( actb ) 5 ’ - GGATGATGACATTGCCGCACTGG - 3 ’ . Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA generation The plasmid JDS246 ( Cas9 ; addgene : # 43861 ) was linearized with MssI - FD ( Thermo Scientific ) and in vitro transcribed with T7 Ultra Kit ( Ambion ) . After polyadenylation , mRNA was CCTop : CRISPR / Cas9 Target Online Prediction Tool PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0124633 April 24 , 2015 3 / 11 purified with RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen ) . sgRNA plasmids were generated via oligo annealing ( sgRNA - 1 _ F 5 ’ - TAGGCGAGGGCGATGCCACCTA - 3 ’ , sgRNA - 1 _ R 5 ’ - AAACTAGGTGG CATCGCCCTCG - 3 ’ ; sgRNA - 2 _ F 5 ’ - TAGGTCAGGGTCAGCAGTCCAT - 3 ’ , sgRNA - 2 _ R 5 ’ - AAACATGGACTGCTGACCCTGA - 3 ’ ; sgRNA - 3 _ F 5 ’ - TAgGCATTTGTCAATGGA TACCC - 3 ’ , sgRNA - 3 _ R 5 ’ - AAACGGGTATCCATTGACAAATG - 3 ’ ; sgRNA - 4 _ F 5 ’ - TAG GATGATGACATTGCCGCAC - 3 ’ , sgRNA - 4 _ R 5 ’ - AAACGTGCGGCAATGTCATCAT - 3 ’ ) and subsequently ligated into BsaI ( Thermo Scientific ) digested vector DR274 ( addgene : # 42250 ) . The template for in vitro transcription was released from purified plasmid with DraI - FD ( Thermo Scientific ) and transcribed with T7 MAXIscript Kit ( Ambion ) or T7 MEGAshort - script Kit ( Ambion ) . Purification was performed via ammonium acetate precipitation and phe - nol / chloroform extraction following the manufacturer ’ s guidelines . Cas9 mRNA and sgRNAs were stored at - 80°C . In vitro cleavage assay with Cas9 protein DNA cleavage assay was carried out based on [ 3 ] with commercially available Cas9 enzyme ( NEB ) . PCR amplified genomic fragments for each sgRNA - 1 off - target site ( OT # 1 _ F 5 ’ - AGAGGCAAGTAAAGGTCAAGTAGG - 3 ’ , OT # 1 _ R 5 ’ - TCACATTGCAATGATGAGCACTTT - 3 ’ ; OT # 2 _ F 5 ’ - CCAGCTCATGTTGAAAAGACACAT - 3 ’ , OT # 2 _ R 5 ’ - CCCCCACAGAT GAAATGAAAAGAC - 3 ’ ; OT # 3 _ F 5 ’ - TACCCAAAAATTGTAAGCCAGCAG - 3 ’ , OT # 3 _ R 5 ’ - AGATCTGATCCGGTTTCAAAGTGA - 3 ’ ) were cloned into pGEM - T easy vector ( Promega ) . The plasmids were pre - linearized with BsaI ( NEB ) about 2kb from the sgRNA target site . 3nM of the pre - linearized plasmids were incubated for one 1h with 30nM sgRNA - 1 and 30nM Cas9 protein ( NEB ) and supplemented with Cas9 nuclease buffer ( NEB ) in a 30 μ l reaction volume at 37°C . Gel electrophoresis was performed on 1 . 5 % agarose gel in 1x TAE buffer ( 40mM Tris , 20mM acetic acid , 1mM EDTA ) . Microinjections and screening of embryos Embryos were injected at one - cell stage according to [ 22 ] . The following concentrations were used : Cas9 mRNA between 150 and 300ng / μ l , sgRNAs 15ng / μ l , and plasmid donors 8 - 10ng / μ l . All components were diluted in nuclease - free ddH 2 O ( Sigma ) . Dead specimens were removed and from two days post fertilization onwards embryos were screened for eGFP expression . To acquire images of eGFP expressing embryos , either a SMZ18 fluorescence - screening binocular ( Nikon ) or an AZ100 ( Nikon ) was used . Maximum Z - projections of stacks were generated in Fiji [ 23 ] . Donor construction For in vivo linearization of the donor plasmids , sgRNA - 1 target site ( T1 ) was cloned into the Golden GATEway cloning system [ 24 ] via oligo annealing ( T1 _ F 5 ’ - GATCAGGCCTGCAGC TGGGCGAGGGCGATGCCACCTACGGCTCGAGCTCGTAC - 3 ’ , T1 _ R 5 ’ - GAGCTCGAGCCG TAGGTGGCATCGCCCTCGCCCAGCTGCAGGCCT - 3 ’ ) . Homology flanks were selected according to integration sites and PCR amplified with prim - ers extended with BamHI ( forward primer ) or KpnI ( reverse primer ) restriction sites via Q5 polymerase ( NEB ) from wildtype medaka genomic DNA ( actb 5 ’ homology flank : F 5 ’ - GGGGATCCCAGCAACGACTTCGCACAAA - 3 ’ , R 5 ’ - GGGGTACCGGCAATGTCATCATC CATGGC - 3 ’ ; rx2 5 ’ homology flank : F 5 ’ - GCCGGATCCAAGCATGTCAAAACGTAGAAGCG - 3 ’ , R 5 ’ - GCCGGTACCCATTTGGCTGTGGACTTGCC - 3 ’ ) . eGFP var was generated via fusion PCR ( fragment 1 eGFP _ F 5 ’ - GCCGGATCCGGAGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGCT - 3 ’ , eGFPvar _ R 5 ’ - GTACGTCGCGTCACCTTCACCCTCGCCGGAC - 3 ’ ; fragment 2 eGFPvar _ F CCTop : CRISPR / Cas9 Target Online Prediction Tool PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0124633 April 24 , 2015 4 / 11 5 ’ - TGAAGGTGACGCGACGTACGGCAAGCTGACCCTG - 3 ’ , eGFP _ R 5 ’ - GCCGGTACCTCC CTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCC - 3 ’ ) with Q5 polymerase ( NEB ) on an eGFP template . eGFP forward and reverse primers were extended with BamHI or KpnI restriction sites , respectively for cloning via Golden GATEway . Results and Discussion CCTop — CRISPR / Cas9 target online predictor To overcome the aforementioned limitations of currently available CRISPR prediction tools , we designed the CRISPR / Cas9 target online predictor — CCTop — ( crispr . cos . uni - heidelberg . de ) as a web tool with a user friendly and intuitive interface ( Fig 1A ) . From any provided DNA sequence all sgRNA target sites will be identified according to adjustable parameters like the type of PAM ( ‘ NGG ’ or ‘ NRG ’ ) , the identity of the two most 5 ’ nucleotides ( ‘ NN ’ , ‘ GN ’ or ‘ GG ’ ) [ 8 , 25 ] as well as the two most 3 ’ nucleotides ( ‘ NN ’ or ‘ GG ’ ) [ 26 ] . For off - target predictions , the selection of a PAM type can be made separately . Experimental evidence indicates that Cas9 nuclease activity strongly correlates with the mismatch position along the sgRNA / DNA heteroduplex . Mismatches close to the PAM will most likely abolish the introduction of a DSB , while more distal mismatches are tolerated [ 13 – 15 ] . We incorporate these findings as a simplified parameter , and define the nucleotides adjacent to the PAM as core sequence ( 12bp default length ) . More than two mismatches in that core abolish DSB introduction [ 13 – 15 ] . Furthermore , sites with more than four mismatches are not targeted by sgRNA / Cas9 [ 13 , 15 , 27 ] . As these options are based on current knowledge , future improvements in the field will be implemented and specified in the ‘ help ’ section of the webpage . At the moment , CCTop provides sgRNA evaluation on the human ( Homo sapiens GRCh38 / hg38 ) , mouse ( Mus musculus GRCm38 / mm10 ) , medaka ( Oryzias latipes oryLat2 ) , Xenopus tropicalis ( JGI4 . 2 / xenTro3 ) , zebrafish ( Danio rerio Zv9 / danRer7 ) , stickleback ( Gaster - osteus aculeatus BROADS1 / gasAcu1 ) , cavefish ( Astyanax mexicanus AstMex102 ) , Caenorhab - ditis elegans ( WBcel235 ) , Drosophila ( D . melanogaster BDGP5 / dm3 ) and Arabidopsis thaliana ( TAIR10 ) genomes . This list will regularly be updated and extended to more organisms in re - sponse to community requests . After processing , a results page ( Fig 1B ) is displayed containing the input parameters , a graphical representation of the query sequence with the identified sgRNA target sites as well as a full list of all candidates ranked by taking into account the number of total off - target sites , the distribution of mismatches and the proximity to exons . For each sgRNA target site , cloning oli - gonucleotides are provided for the DR274 sgRNA vector [ 7 ] . Detailed information is provided for each potential off - target site : genomic coordinates , target sequence with highlighted mis - matches , distance and position ( exonic , intronic or intergenic ) in respect to the closest exon and its corresponding name and identifier . If applicable , the off - target site coordinates are linked to the UCSC Genome Browser [ 28 ] , while gene identifiers are linked to ENSEMBL [ 19 ] . If the query sequence belongs to the selected species , a link to the UCSC Genome Browser is provided for enhanced visualization of the query sequence and target site distribution in addi - tion to other genomic or epigenetic features . Moreover , a fasta file containing all sgRNA target sites as well as a tab separated file containing the full results can be downloaded . CCTop provides all the information necessary to swiftly identify the best candidate sgRNA represented by the order of the sgRNA target sites . Depending on the goal of the experiment , e . g . gene knock - out or knock - in , the best suited candidate might not always be the top hit . Hence , we encourage the user to explore the full list .

To test the on - target efficacy of sgRNA - 1 against T1 , we performed an in vitro assay . Incubation of sgRNA - 1 , Cas9 protein and an eGFP containing plasmid revealed efficient cleavage of the template DNA ( Fig 2A ) . To test the specificity of sgRNA - 1 , a variant of eGFP ( eGFP var ) was used containing six silent mutations in T1 ( Fig 2A , 2C ) . This modification pre - vented sgRNA - 1 from targeting eGFP var ( Fig 2A ) . CCTop predicted three potential off - target sites for the sgRNA - 1 in the medaka genome with different distributions of four mismatches relative to the corresponding PAMs ( Fig 1B and S1 Table ) . We performed the in vitro digestion on all three loci ( Fig 2B ) . Limited Cas9 - de - pendent digestion was detected for off - target number 1 ( OT # 1 , Fig 2B , asterisk ) , but neither for OT # 2 nor for OT # 3 . The first mismatch in OT # 1 appears at position twelve from the PAM ( Fig 1B and S1 Table ) , experimentally corroborating the ranking criteria of CCTop . To validate the efficacy of sgRNA - 1 in vivo , microinjections into medaka zygotes of a ubiq - uitously expressing eGFP line were performed ( wimbledon , wimb ; Fig 2D ) [ 21 ] . Cytoplasmatic injections of Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA - 1 at the one cell stage resulted in efficient inactivation of eGFP . Besides sparse , residual eGFP expression no further phenotype was recognizable ( Fig 2E ) . Randomly picked and sub - cloned amplicons of an injected embryo revealed the Fig 2 . Experimental verification of sgRNA - 1 . ( A ) In vitro cleavage depending on sgRNA - 1 / Cas9 occurred on linearized plasmids containing eGFP but not eGFP var . Successful cleavage of eGFP plasmid ( 4128bp ) resulted in a 2052bp and 2076bp fragment . The absence of expected fragments ( 627bp , 4025bp ) demonstrated that eGFP var ( 4652bp ) was not digested by sgRNA - 1 / Cas9 . ( B ) A faint double band ( 2154bp , 2198bp , asterisk ) indicated inefficient digestion of off - target 1 ( OT # 1 ) while OT # 2 and OT # 3 ( S1 Table ) were not cleaved .

In order to further validate the selection of sgRNAs by CCTop , we chose to target three en - dogenous genes with distinct expression patterns in medaka . Alpha a crystallin ( cryaa ) expres - sion is restricted to the lens [ 29 ] , the retinal homeobox gene 2 ( rx2 ) is exclusively expressed in the neuroretina of developing medaka [ 30 ] and β - actin ( actb ) is expressed ubiquitiously in the whole body [ 31 ] . For each gene we used CCTop to predict reliable sgRNAs targeting the imme - diate downstream sequence of the corresponding translational start site ( S1 Table ) . For effi - cient screening of successful sgRNA / Cas9 targeting already in the injected generation , we generated a donor construct containing the T1 site for in vivo linearization and the eGFP var se - quence . Upon co - injection of the donor plasmid , Cas9 mRNA , sgRNA - 1 and the sgRNA against cryaa , eGFP var was integrated into the target locus via NHEJ ( Fig 3A ) [ 32 , 33 ] . In the cases of rx2 and actb , homology flanks ( ca . 400bp ) were added for the eGFP var cassette for inte - gration via HDR ( Fig 3B , 3D ) [ 5 , 34 – 36 ] . For each of the three candidate genes , eGFP has been consistently detected exclusively in the expected tissue in all experiments ( Fig 3 and S2 Table ) . Interestingly , already the injected generation revealed highly homogeneous expression of eGFP var in the respective tissues / organs ( Fig 3 ) . After injection , visual detection of eGFP in the cryaa domain was low , due to the likely out - of - frame integration via NHEJ ( 4 / 422 ) ( S2 Table ) . In contrast , the HDR - mediated integra - tions into the rx2 and actb loci reached significantly higher rates , 72 / 472 and 79 / 270 respective - ly ( S2 Table ) . Furthermore , the eGFP var integration into the rx2 and actb loci was transmitted successfully to the next generation ( cryaa was not pursued further ) . From 6 rx2 : : eGFP var posi - tive fish , 5 transmitted the integration to the next generation ( 22 . 5 % maximal germline Fig 3 . Visual evaluation of targeting specificity of selected sgRNAs . Exclusive and homogenous expression of eGFP in the domains of cryaa ( A , A ’ ) , rx2 ( B ) and actb ( D ) was evident already in the injected generation ( F0 ) . The integrations were transmitted to the next generation ( F1 ; C , E ) . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0124633 . g003 CCTop : CRISPR / Cas9 Target Online Prediction Tool PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0124633 April 24 , 2015 8 / 11 transmission rate ) ( Fig 3C ) . For the actb : : eGFP var positive fish , 2 out of 7 were founders ( 15 . 3 % maximal germline transmission rate ) ( Fig 3E ) . The high integration rates of eGFP var and the strong specificity of the expression pattern validate that the sgRNAs identified by CCTop effi - ciently targeted their designated loci and that no off - target site interaction occurred . The application of the CRISPR / Cas9 system is enhanced by a careful and precise off - target prediction . We provide an online tool matching the needs of both beginners and experts . This is achieved by a concise but complete number of selectable parameters . We provide validated default settings with high success rates in multiple experiments that can still be tuned . The top ranked sgRNA target sites have been experimentally validated in vitro and in vivo in different approaches . Taken together CCTop allows target selection in a wide range of model and non - model genomes and guides the user towards selecting the optimal target site . Supporting Information S1 Fig . Workflow of CCTop . The input sequence is scanned to identify sgRNA target sites ac - cording to the parameters specified in the main page . Oligo pairs for target site cloning are gen - erated ( see Material and Methods ) . For each candidate target site , the potential off - target sites are determined using Bowtie1 . The closest exon is assigned to each potential off - target and its score is computed . With this information each candidate is ranked and finally the results are provided in different output formats . If the query sequence was derived from the same genome the candidate target sites were evaluated against , a bed - file containing the genomic coordinates and target scores is passed on to the UCSC genome browser as custom track .
