Clathrin - mediated endocytosis involves cargo selection and membrane budding into vesicles with the aid of a protein coat . Formation of invaginated pits on the plasma membrane and subsequent budding of vesicles is an energetically demanding process that involves the cooperation of clathrin with many different proteins . Here we investigate the role of the brain - enriched protein epsin 1 in this process . Epsin is targeted to areas of endocytosis by binding the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) . We show here that epsin 1 directly modiﬁes membrane curvature on binding to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in conjunction with clathrin polymerization . We have discovered that formation of an amphipathic a - helix in epsin is coupled to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding . Mutation of residues on the hydrophobic region of this helix abolishes the ability to curve membranes . We propose that this helix is inserted into one leaﬂet of the lipid bilayer , inducing curvature . On lipid monolayers epsin alone is sufﬁcient to facilitate the formation of clathrin - coated invaginations . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is essential for many cellular pro - cesses , including synaptic vesicle recycling , nutrient uptake and removal of receptors and ion channels from the cell surface 1 – 5 . The formation of a new vesicle is thought to be driven by both the polymerization of the coat protein clathrin into a cage - like structure and the selection / modiﬁcation of membrane lipids 5 , 6 . Epsin 1 is implicated in clathrin - mediated endocytosis by binding to the coat components , clathrin , Eps15 and the AP2 complex ( Fig . 1a ) 7 – 9 . There are now at least four known mammalian epsins with different expression patterns ( epsins 1 – 3 and epsin R ; see http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov or http : / / www . kazusa . or . jp / en / ) . The epsin 1 homologue in Drosophila ( liquid facets ) is an essential gene and as withyeast epsins it has been implicated in endocytosis 10 , 11 . The most conserved feature of the epsin family is the epsin N - terminal homology ( ENTH ) domain . This domain is structurally homolo - gous but distinct from the AP180 N - terminal homology ( ANTH ) domain found at the N termini of AP180 , CALM and HIP . Both domains bind to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( refs 12 , 13 ) . Tubulation of liposomes Although both the ANTH domain of AP180 and the ENTH domain of epsin bind to lipids they have distinct effects on liposome shape . Epsin or its ENTH domain converted liposomes made from total brain lipids ( Folch extract containing 10 % phosphoinositides ) into tubules ( Fig . 1b ) . In contrast , the ANTH domain of either AP180 or CALM had no effect on liposome morphology . The outer diameter of the tubules that formed owing to the action of the ENTH domain on liposomes was approximately one - third that formed by the action of either dynamin ( not shown ) or the N - terminus of amphiphysin ( Fig . 1b ) . Addition of the ENTH domain to synthetic liposomes containing 10 % PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( but not liposomes sub - stituted with 10 % phosphatidylserine ( PtdSer ) ) also induced tubu - lation , but the tubules were frequently irregular and many were fragmented into small vesicles ( not shown ) . To begin to understand these effects of epsin we investigated the structural basis of epsin binding to phosphoinositol head groups . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding by epsin The epsin ENTH domain was crystallized in the presence of inositol - 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) and the structure was solved at 1 . 7 A ˚ resolution ( Fig . 2a ; See also Supplementary Infor - mation Table 1 ) . Compared with an earlier structure of this domain solved in the absence of a lipid head group 14 ( Fig . 2a , middle structure ) , a new helix became ordered at the N - terminus , which we have named ‘helix zero’ . There is also a small rotation in a 8 due to different crystal packing . Helix 0 ( a 0 , residues 3 – 15 ) folds back across the face of a 1 and the loop between a 1 and a 2 . This creates a deep basic groove that forms the binding pocket for the Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ligand ( Fig . 2a , c ) . The ligand is coordinated by residues from a 0 , a 1 , the a 1 – a 2 loop , a 3 and a 4 , and all three phosphates are multiply coordinated ( Fig . 2b ) . This coordination is consistent with NMR data , although a 0 was undeﬁned in the structure 12 . We obtained an additional crystal form in the presence of Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( solved to 1 . 57 A˚ and identical to that solved by ref . 14 in the absence of ligand ) , which contained no density for bound ligand or a 0 . These data indicate that binding of Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and a 0 formation are coupled . The increase in a - helicity induced by the inositol head group was conﬁrmed by circular dichroism spectroscopy ( data not shown ) . a 0 is amphipathic , displaying a series of hydrophobic residues ( L6 , M10 , I13 ) on its outer surface ( Fig . 2c ; see also Supplementary Information Fig . 1 ) , while the head group is coordinated by its inner surface . This helix is orientated such that it has the potential to interact with the membrane . The coordination of Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 in the crystal structure suggested that epsin is speciﬁc for particular head groups , and we conﬁrmed this by afﬁnity measurement using isothermal titration calorimetry ( Fig . 3a ) . We found head - group binding only if the inositol bears a phosphate on both positions 4 and 5 , as binding of Ins ( 1 , 4 ) P 2 and Ins ( 1 , 5 ) P 2 was not detected . Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 bound with an afﬁnity of 3 . 6 ^ 0 . 4 m M . In the crystal structure residues R8 , H73 and the main chain Nof N30 coordinate phosphate 4 , and K11 , R25 and R63 coordinate phosphate 5 ( Fig . 2b , c ) . This coordination of the ligand by residues on the inner surface of helix 0 yields a large binding enthalpy that compensates for the entropic penalty of the formation of helix 0 ( Supplementary Information Table 2 ) . Epsin bound InsP 6 with a higher afﬁnity than Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( 0 . 55 m M compared with 3 . 6 m M ) and with a 1 : 1 stoichiometry . The short chain lipid di - O - octanoglyceryl - phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bi - phosphate ( diC 8 PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) also had a higher afﬁnity than its corresponding head group , implying small additional contributions by the glycerol backbone , although the head group is still the main determinant of the strength of the interaction . Head - group binding measured by calorimetry , and lipid binding measured by pelleting with liposomes , showed the same speciﬁcities ( ref . 12 , Fig . 3b and articles NATURE | VOL 419 | 26 SEPTEMBER 2002 | www . nature . com / nature 361 data not shown ) . For comparison , the ANTH domain of AP180 had an afﬁnity of 30 m M for Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and 5 . 1 m M for InsP 6 . In contrast to epsin , two ANTH domains bound to each InsP 6 molecule , indicative of a binding site exposed on the surface of the protein ( see Fig . 2a ) , in agreement with our previous obser - vations 13 and the much smaller entropic loss ( Supplementary Information Table 2 ) . For this reason and on the basis of consensus sequences surrounding the AP180 lipid - binding site we propose the subdivision of the epsin / AP180 families . The family of ANTH domain proteins can be deﬁned by the consensus sequence ( K / G ) A ( T / I ) x 6 ( P / L / V ) KxK ( H / Y ) . The mammalian ENTH domain family can also be deﬁned by a consensus over the same region , ( D / E ) ATx 2 ( D / E ) PWGP . This takes into account that not all epsins necessarily bind PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , indeed we predict that Drosophila epsin - like protein and its mammalian homologue , which we call epsinR ( epsin - related protein , KIAA0171 ) , bind to a less phosphorylated head group ( Fig . 2d ) . Cell expression studies of epsin 1 In vivo , expression of the epsin ENTH domain in COS cells gave many intensely stained rod - like proﬁles ( not seen with PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding mutants ) , which may be indicative of folding in the plane of the membrane or tubulation ( Fig . 4 ) . Full - length epsin showed either a general cytoplasmic distribution or accumu - lation in puncta on the plasma membrane 9 ( Fig . 4 ) . The puncta co - labelled with antibodies for the AP2 complex ( see enlargements ) , clathrin , Eps15 and dynamin , but not for the AP1 complex , the early endosome marker EEA1 , or the Golgi marker GM130 ( Supplemen - tary Information Fig . 2 and see http : / / www2 . mrc - lmb . cam . ac . uk / groups / hmm / epsin / IF ) . These puncta probably represent endo - cytically incompetent coated - pits , because dynamin is not present in mature vesicles and the puncta were found on the plasma membrane ( confocal sectioning not shown ) . An inhibition of coated vesicle formation by epsin was conﬁrmed using the suspen - sion cell line RPMI 1788 cells ( Fig . 3d ) . Cells transfected with epsin or with the AP180 carboxy terminus 13 had reduced numbers of coated vesicles , whereas vesicles accumulate with the uncoating mutant auxilin N844 ( ref . 15 ) . To probe the function of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding we made a double mutant , R63L H73L , that no longer bound to liposomes containing PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 or to Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( Fig . 3a , b ) . The expression pattern of the full - length mutant in COS cells was now always cytoplasmic and the AP2 complex tended to aggregate ( Fig . 4 , third row ) whereas clathrin remained largely unaltered with a punctate distribution ( not shown ) . Transferrin endocytosis was inhibited in more than 90 % of these cells , even in cells with a low level of protein expression . Thus targeting of epsin to the plasma membrane by phosphoinositide binding is linked to correct localization of the cargo recruitment complex AP2 . The retention of clathrin puncta in cells expressing R63L H73L shows that other proteins can maintain clathrin recruitment . In contrast to R63L H73L epsin , we reported previously that overexpression of the AP180 C - terminus caused a redistribution of both the perinuclear and plasma membrane pools of clathrin 13 . This correlates with the greater binding capacity of AP180 C - terminus for clathrin whereas epsin binds better to the AP2 complex ( Fig . 3c ; see also ref . 16 ) . The epsin used in our experiments ( epsin 1 ) had no effect on AP1 staining ( and did not bind to g - adaptin ; Fig . 3c ) . Thus epsin 1 mutants may be more speciﬁc inhibitors of AP2 - mediated , coated - vesicle transport , whereas AP180 mutants would be pre - dicted to affect all clathrin - mediated budding events . Role of helix 0 in membrane curvature Tubulation of liposomes has been observed with a number of proteins 17 – 19 . In the cases of dynamin , amphiphysin and endophilin the tubulation can be attributed at least in part to self - oligomeriza - tion . Electron microscopy observations revealed that amphiphysin ( Fig . 1b ) and dynamin can both form tubular extensions from liposomes . With epsin , these intermediates were not seen , implying that it does not tubulate by means of oligomerization . In the case of epsin ENTH domain , we were not able to detect oligomerization by crosslinking on liposomes or by gel - ﬁltration or ultracentrifugation , in the absence or presence of saturating concentrations of head group , and at protein concentrations up to 0 . 5 mM ( not shown ) . The protein clearly behaved as a monomer , so we conclude that monomeric interactions cause changes in membrane curvature . We have noted the formation of an amphipathic helix 0 on binding of Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 to the ENTH domain ( Fig . 2 ) . The hydro - phobic outer surface of helix 0 was targeted for mutagenesis . Mutants of residue L6 to E , Q , H and W showed less binding to liposomes , implying a role for helix 0 in membrane interactions Figure 1 Epsin 1 ENTH domain tubulates liposomes . a , Modular arrangement of endocytic proteins . The epsin family can be recognized by the presence of an N - terminal lipid - binding ENTH domain and a clathrin / adaptor - binding domain . The ENTH domain is homologous over the ﬁrst 150 residues to the ANTH domains of AP180 , CALM and HIP1 , although the lipid - binding residues are very different ( see Fig . 2d ) . The ENTH domain is followedbyubiquitin - interactingmotifs . Theadaptor - binding motifsinepsin 1 ( eight DPW motifs ) and DPF - like motifs in other endocytic proteins bind to the appendage domains of the AP2 complex 25 . NPF motifs at the C terminus of epsin 1 interact with the Eps15 homology ( EH ) domain of Eps15 ( refs 7 – 9 ) . The scale bar is in amino acid residues . b , Electron microscopy of liposomes in the presence of the domains indicated . dAmphN , Drosophila amphiphysin N - terminus 26 . The outer diameter of tubules formed with epsin ENTH domain was 15 ^ 1nm , that of tubules formed with full - length epsin was 19 ^ 3nm , and that in the presence of dAmphN was 46 ^ 2nm . articles NATURE | VOL 419 | 26 SEPTEMBER 2002 | www . nature . com / nature 362 ( Fig . 3b ) . Furthermore , the ability of these mutants to tubulate liposomes was related to hydrophobicity of the substituted residue ( Fig . 5 ) . Thus L6Q with its hydrophobic and polar component bound to liposomes but failed to tubulate them . L6H tubulated liposomes ( although less markedly than wild type ) , whereas L6W with its larger hydrophobic surface led to extensive tubulation and vesiculation . Although the L6E mutant still bound to short chain lipids in solution ( Fig . 3a ) , the negative charge on the outer surface of this helix probably repels the membrane . From this we conclude that the hydrophobic outer surface of helix 0 is crucial for the induction of membrane curvature . We tested these mutants in full - length epsin for their distribution in COS cells ( Fig . 4 , fourth row and data not shown ) and found that all the L6 mutants still localize in puncta just like wild - type epsin . Consistent with epsin targeting being predominantly due to binding of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 head groups , we found that the L6E and L6Q mutants can indeed bind to short chain lipid diC 8 PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 with afﬁnities close to wild type ( Fig . 3a ) . Membrane invagination coupled to clathrin polymerization To study the effects of epsin on clathrin recruitment in conjunction with lipid binding we used lipid monolayers containing PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Fig . 6 ) . We previously introduced this methodology for visualization and dissection of clathrin assembly by electron microscopy 13 , and we found here that AP180 recruited clathrin to the monolayer where it polymerized into patches of deﬁned size ( see also Fig . 6f ) . These patches are approximately the diameter of coated vesicles in the brain , consistent with the use of brain isoforms of proteins and brain - derived clathrin . This points to a function of AP180 in limiting vesicle size ( see also refs 13 , 20 , 21 ) .

Epsin , similar to AP180 , was able to recruit and promote clathrin polymerization on the mono - layer ( Fig . 6a , d , e ; see also http : / / www2 . mrc - lmb . cam . ac . uk / groups / hmm / epsin / EM ) , but the clathrin was less uniformly poly - merized than in the presence of AP180 , as seen from the high background of clathrin triskelia ( Fig . 6d , compare with b and c ) and the less efﬁcient recruitment of clathrin to liposomes by epsin ( data not shown ) . Where there was clathrin polymerization by epsin , it was generally more extensive than with AP180 , and showed clear signs of invagination . Pentagons can be resolved in the clathrin patches ( implying curvature ) and the three - dimensional shape of the clathrin - coated buds can be visualized using stereo images ( Fig . 6d ) . Shadowing the clathrin patches with platinum also showed that they are invaginated ; however , this process destroyed most of these structures ( not shown ) . Even without shadowing we frequently found footprints ( both large and small ) where the invaginations have been washed off ( see left of panel c ) . We also found this process at an intermediate stage of partial detachment ( see right of panel b ) . Neither the R63L H73L nor the L6E mutants formed clathrin - coated invaginations ( data not shown ) . These observations provide clear evidence of a role for epsin in membrane invagination together with the polymerization of clathrin .

Therefore epsin may also be targeted to this region where the need for curvature - forming molecules will be greatest . This implies that epsinwill not be needed to maintain curvature once the clathrin lattice is laid down and indeed we have previously shown that AP2 facilitates curvature of the lattice on membranes 23 . Our results also point to the cooperativity between AP2 and epsin recruitment to membranes , as we found that the localization of the R63L H73L mutant is cytoplasmic , and AP2 staining is no longer punctate ( leading to an inhibition of transferrin endocytosis ) . Thus mem - brane invagination and cargo recruitment may go hand - in - hand . Epsin 1 is not enriched in mature coated vesicles of the brain ( I . G . M . and H . T . McM . , unpublished observations ; see also ref . 9 ) , and on liposomes it forms narrower tubules than those formed by amphi - physin or a dynamin . Thus if epsin were ﬁnally concentrated at the neck of the budding vesicle , then the narrowing of the neck may provide a weak point for the separation of the vesicle from the parent membrane on GTP hydrolysis of dynamin .

The irregular lattices contain both pentagons and hexagons and therefore are slightly raised from the surface of the monolayer . The background lattices are irregular and variable in size and shape . b , c , In the presence of epsin and AP180 , invaginated assemblies are still formed , but the background lattices show a more regular structure reminiscent of the lattices formed when AP180 and clathrin alone are incubated with the monolayers ( see f ) .

We have shown that epsin causes a strong degree of membrane curvature and tubulation , even fragmentation of membranes with a high PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 con - tent . We envisage that epsin binding to membranes facilitates their deformation by insertion of helix 0 into the outer leaﬂet of the bilayer , pushing the head groups apart . This would reduce the energy needed to curvethe membrane into a vesicle , making it easier for the clathrin cage to ﬁx and stabilize the curved membrane ( see also ref . 24 ) . Thus our experiments point to a pioneering role for epsin in vesicle budding as it provides both a driving force and a link between membrane invagination , clathrin polymerization and AP2 complex recruitment .

Liposome tubulation , sedimentation and electron microscopy Synthetic liposomes contained 10 % cholesterol , 40 % phosphatidylethanolamine , 40 % phosphatidylcholine , and 10 % of the test lipid ( in most cases phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) bisphosphate ) . Bovine brain lipids ( Folch Fraction 1 , which contains approximately 10 % phosphatidylinositol lipids ) were purchased from Sigma ( B1502 ) . Liposomes were resuspended at 1mgm 2 1 in 50mM HEPES , pH7 . 4 , 120mM NaCl and extruded through a 0 . 4 - m m cyclopore ﬁlter .

For tubulation and sedimentation assays GST tags have been cleaved from the proteins but the presence of an N - terminal GST tag did not prevent either the tubulation of Folch liposomes by epsin or sedimentation .
