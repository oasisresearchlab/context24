These models have been successfully employed for numerous SARS - - CoV - 2 predicting tasks , making their use for predicting the pandemic’s development in Malaysia particularly relevant . In Malaysia’s context , multiple studies have used deep learning models for predicting the pandemic’s progression , but a few have used deep learning and optimization together in a sin - gle paper . The current paper has extended the deep learning models up to six models with an extended comparison of optimized and non - optimized algorithms . Further , most of the researchers have used only one to three models only . For instance , [ 1 ] utilized a multi - input multi - output CNN model to forecast SARS - COV - 2 cases in several countries , including Malaysia . Their findings suggested that the CNN model effectively identified local patterns in the data and produced accurate forecasts . Likewise , other research such as [ 2 ] explored the use of LSTM and Bi - LSTM models for SARS - COV - 2 forecasting in the region , showcasing their capacity to grasp complex temporal dependencies in the data and deliver dependable predic - tions . [ 3 ] used a hybrid deep learning model , SSA , and ConvLSTm network for predicting the wind speed . [ 4 ] used advanced comparative prediction models based on random forest , LSTM , and MLP that had high prediction accuracy for commodity prices using text mining methods . The deep learning models discussed in this review encompass Long Short - Term Memory ( LSTM ) , Short - Term Memory ( LSTM ) , Bidirectional LSTM ( Bi - LSTM ) , Convolu - tional Neural Networks ( CNN ) , CNN - LSTM , Gated Recurrent Unit ( GRU ) , Recurrent Neural Network ( RNN ) , and Multi - Layer Perceptron’s ( MLP ) . These models have been used in vari - ous research projects to forecast SARS - COV - 2 cases , fatalities , and recoveries , as well as to pre - dict the effects of distinct government interventions and public health measures [ 5 , 6 ] . 1 . 1 SARS - COV - 2 pandemic in Malaysia Following the initial reported case in January 2020 , Malaysia has enforced rigorous measures to manage the virus’s dissemination . The nation’s response has developed over time , adjusting to the pandemic’s shifting landscape . Key aspects of Malaysia’s response include lockdowns , travel restrictions , mass vaccination drives , healthcare infrastructure enhancement , and testing and tracing capabilities . 1 . 2 Model selection and evaluation Choosing suitable models and evaluation methods for SARS - COV - 2 forecasting can be daunt - ing , considering the pandemic’s intricate nature and the various factors influencing its trans - mission . Researchers need to contemplate several aspects , such as model intricacy , interpretability , and generalizability when creating and evaluating forecasting models . Fur - thermore , the rapidly changing dynamics of the pandemic demand continuous model adapta - tion and assessment , as models that excel at one point may become less precise as the situation progresses . Despite these challenges , advanced deep - learning models have demonstrated the potential in capturing complex data patterns and providing accurate forecasts . By compre - hending the challenges and complexities of SARS - COV - 2 forecasting , researchers can persist in developing and refining models , ultimately contributing to informed policymaking , strate - gic resource allocation , and efficient public health interventions in Malaysia . Brief Compara - tive Studies in Malaysia Numerous studies have carried out comparative analyses of deep learning models to assess their performance in predicting pandemic cases in Malaysia . [ 7 – 9 ] performed an extensive comparison of GRU , LSTM , and CNN models for forecasting cases in Malaysia . The authors utilized daily recoveries , confirmed cases , and deaths as input features for models and assessed their performance using metrics such as MAE and RMSE . The study aimed to identify the best deep learning model to capture complex temporal PLOS ONE Power of AI : SARS - CoV - 2 PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0287755 July 20 , 2023 2 / 17 patterns in the data and provide accurate forecasts . The results revealed that both LSTM and GRU surpassed the CNN model in terms of prediction accuracy . [ 10 – 15 ] ; used LSTM , GRU , and Transformer models for predicting SARS - COV - 2 cases in Malaysia . They employed simi - lar features as previous researchers , focusing on daily cases , deaths , and confirmed cases . Eval - uation metrics such as MAE , RMSE , and MAPE were used . The study aimed to determine the best deep learning model for identifying the complex nature of the relationship between differ - ent features . The authors credited this finding to the Transformer model’s self - attention mech - anism , which allowed it to capture complex dependencies in the data more effectively than the LSTM and GRU models . Furthermore , the Transformer model demonstrated faster training times and better scalability compared to the other models , making it a more practical choice for large - scale SARS - COV - 2 forecasting tasks in Malaysia . [ 16 – 21 ] used LSTM , GRU , and CNN - based models for predicting cases in Malaysia and various other countries . The authors employed daily confirmed cases as input features and evaluated the models’ performance using MAE and RMSE . Their study concluded that LSTM and GRU models outperformed CNN models , emphasizing the importance of selecting appro - priate deep - learning models for pandemic evolution prediction in Malaysia . Researchers [ 22 – 25 ] compared LSTM , GRU , and 1D - CNN models in the context of forecasting future cases in Malaysia . They utilized similar features and evaluation metrics as earlier studies . The results revealed that GRU models exhibited the best overall performance , showcasing their potential for predicting cases in Malaysia . [ 26 – 30 ] provided a comparison of LSTM , GRU , and CNN models , employing features and evaluation metrics like MAE and RMSE , consistent with pre - vious research . The importance of selecting suitable deep - learning models for case prediction was emphasized . In a comparison of LSTM , GRU , and Prophet models for forecasting cases in Malaysia [ 31 – 35 ] , MAE and RMSE were used as evaluation metrics . The study found that LSTM and GRU models outperformed the Prophet model . [ 36 – 40 ] used LSTM , GRU , and 1D - CNN models , using daily confirmed cases , recoveries , and deaths as input features , and MAE , RMSE , and MAPE for evaluating model performance . The GRU model performed the best in this context . [ 41 – 43 ] conducted a comparative study on LSTM , GRU , and CNN models for Malaysia , using similar features and metrics as previous research ( MAE and RMSE ) . The GRU model was found to achieve the highest prediction accuracy . [ 44 – 47 ] used LSTM , GRU , and CNN models , using MAE , RMSE , and MAPE alongside similar features as earlier studies . The LSTM model provided the best performance . [ 48 – 52 ] carried out a comparative study involving LSTM , GRU , and 1D - CNN models for Malaysia , using similar features and evalua - tion metrics as previous researchers . The LSTM model achieved the highest prediction accu - racy in this context . [ 53 ] used the VMD - Staked GRU model to accurately predict individual stock finances from the industry environment factors that provide significantly improved pre - dictions . [ 54 ] compared LSTM and other popular models for energy consumption forecasting that provided to have high accuracy for energy systems . [ 55 ] provided a comprehensive analy - sis using machine learning approaches that highlighted the rapid growth , geo trends , and their applications in various domains . These comparative studies emphasize the significance of choosing the most appropriate deep - learning model for understanding the pandemic’s progression in Malaysia . While LSTM and GRU models have proven successful in capturing long - range dependencies in time series data , CNN models have also demonstrated effectiveness in certain scenarios . The selection of a deep - learning model should be based on the specific needs and limitations of the forecasting task , as well as the available data and computational resources . Moreover , these studies under - score the importance of employing deep learning models to generate accurate and dependable forecasts , which can aid decision - makers and public health officials in mitigating the pandem - ic’s impact in Malaysia .

Conclusion and recommendation for future research Future research could explore alternative feature selection and preprocessing techniques to improve model performance in the Malaysian context . The study focused on filling the research gaps by forecasting SARS - COV - 2 using various deep - learning methods . The models helped to accurately forecast the changing landscape of infections in Malaysia . Additionally , our study contributes to the growing body of research on using deep learning models for pan - demic forecasting , which could be applied to future public health crises . Among all tested models and based on evaluation metrics , the RNN with optimization appears to be the best - performing model , as it has the lowest MAE and the highest R - squared value . The GRU with optimization also demonstrates strong performance with the lowest MSE and RMSE values . Additionally , studies could investigate the cause of the perfect scores observed for the RNN and MLP models and develop strategies to address these issues . Researchers could also con - sider applying other optimization methods other than Bayesian Optimization . By using the best - performing models to predict new cases , they can make more informed decisions about resource allocation , public health measures , and vaccination strategies . Accurate forecasting of SARS - COV - 2 dynamics is crucial for informed policy - making and resource allocation in Malaysia . Different model’s superior performance can provide valuable insights for public health officials and decision - makers in the country . By leveraging these models , authorities can better anticipate the pandemic’s trajectory , implement timely interven - tions , and allocate resources efficiently to mitigate the impact of the virus on the population . The discussion section highlights the performance of the deep learning models , compares the findings with previous studies , acknowledges limitations , and suggests future research Fig 10 .
