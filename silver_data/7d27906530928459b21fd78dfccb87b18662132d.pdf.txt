Existing firm­level taxonomies of knowledge accumulation cannot explain why most latecomer firms fail to transit to advanced levels in high­tech manufacturing industries . The proposed framework combines firm­level taxonomy of knowledge accumulation with catch­up trajectory to argue that , under the knowledge regime of a high­tech manufacturing industry , latecomers ' learning experience differs from those as posited by previous studies . Using the integrated circuit industry as the empirical anchor , this paper shows that firms undergo ' critical transition ' in learning which involves sustainable innovative capacity and momentum­ generation to reach the advanced level . It shows how OEMs build knowledge to leapfrog incumbents without competing with their branded customers . Throughout the process , inter­firm collaboration and open innovation are critical sources of knowledge .
