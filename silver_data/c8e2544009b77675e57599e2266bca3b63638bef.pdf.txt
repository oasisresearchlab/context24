In Ireland , the first NH case of COVID - 19 occurred on 16 / 03 / 2020 . A national point - prevalence testing program of all NH residents and staff took place from 18 / 04 / 2020 - 05 / 05 / 2020 . Aims : To examine characteristics of NHs across three Community Health Organisations ( CHOs ) in Ireland , proportions with COVID - 19 outbreaks , staff and resident , symptom - profile and resident case - fatality . Methods : Forty - five NHs surveyed across three CHOs requesting details on occupancy , size , COVID - 19 outbreak , timing of outbreak , total symptomatic / asymptomatic cases , and outcomes for residents from 29 / 02 / 2020 - 22 / 05 / 2020 . Results : Surveys were returned from ( 62 . 2 % , 28 / 45 ) of NHs ( 2043 residents , 2303 beds ) . Three - quarters ( 21 / 28 ) had COVID - 19 outbreaks ( 1741 residents , 1972 beds ) . Median time from first case of COVID - 19 in Ireland to first case in these NHs was 27 . 0 days . Resident COVID - 19 incidence was ( 43 . 9 % , 764 / 1741 ) : laboratory - confirmed ( 40 . 1 % , 710 / 1741 ) with ( 27 . 2 % , 193 / 710 asymptomatic ) , and clinically - suspected ( 3 . 1 % , 54 / 1741 ) . Resident case - fatality was ( 27 . 6 % , 211 / 764 ) for combined laboratory - confirmed / clinically - suspected COVID - 19 . Similar proportions of residents in NH with an “early” outbreak ( < 28days ) versus a later outbreak developed confirmed / suspected COVID - 19 . A lower proportion of residents in NHs with “early” outbreaks had recovered compared to those with “late” outbreaks ( 37 . 4 % vs 61 . 7 % ; χ2 = 56 . 9 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Among 675 NH staff across twenty - four sites who had .

NH residents are among the frailest in society , with multiple comorbidities and high levels of care needs . NH facilities vary in size , staffing and governance structure , and their integration with the wider health system locally , nationally , and internationally [ 2 ] . Policies on testing and reporting of COVID - 19 cases in NHs differ between countries but deaths in care home residents have accounted for 24 - 82 % of all COVID - 19 - related deaths [ 1 ] . Guidance published specifically for long term care facilities on infection prevention and management in the context of COVID - 19 [ 3 , 4 ] can be challenging to implement due to variability in facilities and governance structures . In Ireland , there is a “mixed market” of NH care provision . Public NHs are owned and operated by the government - funded Health Service Executive ( HSE ) and private NHs by individual providers or legal provider entities . All must be registered with the Health Information and Quality Authority ( HIQA ) and comply with regulations for minimum standards of care ( Health Act 2007 ) [ 5 ] . There were 31 , 220 residential care beds registered across 581 NHs in Ireland in December 2018 [ 6 ] : the majority were private NHs with approximately 25 , 000 residents , with 121 ( 21 % ) public NHs with approximately 5 , 000 residents . The first laboratory - confirmed case of COVID - 19 in Ireland occurred in the community on 29 / 02 / 2020 [ 7 ] . The first clusters of COVID - 19 were reported in NHs on 16 / 03 / 2020 . The .

As of 20 / 05 / 2020 , 258 NH clusters were reported accounting for 4 , 872 cases and 851 deaths . The national case - fatality figure for NH residents related to COVID - 19 is 17 . 5 % . The majority of NH clusters have occurred around Dublin / eastern Ireland , with a sizeable proportion of NH facilities outside this area unaffected by COVID - 19 outbreaks to date [ 7 ] . The national case - fatality may be an underestimate , failing to capture earlier attributable NH deaths . Given emerging evidence of impact on NHs , the Irish health service directed a national point - prevalence mass COVID - 19 testing program of all residents and staff in NHs from 18 / 04 / 2020 - 05 / 05 / 2020 . Aims : We aimed to examine characteristics of NHs across three Irish Community Health Organisations ( CHOs ) in Dublin / Eastern Ireland , the proportion with outbreaks of COVID - 19 , symptom profile for staff and residents , and resident mortality rates . Methods : An information sheet and survey document was distributed to the lead Nursing and / or Medical Officer in forty - five NHs across three CHOs . This was followed by a telephone call to obtain consent and aid completion of the survey , ensuring correct interpretation of information . Data was requested for the period 29 / 02 / 2020 - 22 / 05 / 2020 and a deadline for returns set for one - week later . Responses were anonymised with no site , resident , or staff identifiers requested or retained . The survey requested details on the occupancy in the NH on 29 / 02 / 2020 , total number of beds , proportion of single rooms , details of COVID - 19 outbreak , date of the first laboratory - confirmed COVID - 19 resident and / or staff member , total number of .

Symptoms were defined as per public health guidance ( cough , fever , dyspnoea ) and any “new - onset” symptoms the medical officer / general practitioner felt reflective of emerging information on atypical COVID - 19 symptoms . Asymptomatic cases ( without symptoms 7 - days either side of test ) were identified in the national point - prevalence mass testing program of residents and staff which took place from 18 / 04 / 2020 - 05 / 05 / 2020 . Laboratory - confirmed cases were those with “detected” SARS - CoV - 2 infection by Real - Time Reverse Transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction ( RT - PCR ) testing on nasopharyngeal swabs . Suspected cases were based on senior medical / nursing opinion of COVID - 19 symptoms , but resident was unable / unwilling to complete testing or was isolated awaiting results . For inclusion in analysis , an outbreak was defined as ≥1 resident with laboratory - confirmed COVID - 19 . NHs with one to two staff members and no residents affected weren’t considered outbreaks on the basis that infection may have been acquired outside of the NH setting . An “active” outbreak was defined as being within twenty - eight days of symptom onset for most recent laboratory - confirmed case in a resident / staff member . Data are reported as proportions ( and percentages ) and mean / median with standard deviation ( SD ) / interquartile ranges ( IQR ) as appropriate . Data on NH size ( number of beds ) and occupancy ( percentage of beds ) were transformed into discrete categories for between - group analysis ( size : < 50 beds , 51 - 100 beds , > 100 beds ; occupancy ; < 75 % , 75 - 85 % , 86 - 95 % and > 95 % ) . Comparisons of proportions between groups was carried out using a Chi - square statistic . Spearman Rank correlations were used to analyse correlations between variables . All ethical standards were adhered to in the acquisition , anonymisation , and reporting of data . Results : Complete surveys were returned from 62 . 2 % ( 28 / 45 ) of NHs with a total of 2043 residents in 2303 beds ( median occupancy 96 . 7 % , IQR : 86 . 0 – 96 . 6 % ) on 29 / 02 / 2020 . During the eighty - three - day study period , 15 . 3 % ( 312 / 2043 ) of residents died . .

Median time from the first case of COVID - 19 infection in Ireland to the first recorded cases in NHs ( staff / residents ) included in this series was 27 . 0 days ( IQR : 22 . 5 - 40 . 5 ) . Four NHs recorded no confirmed cases of COVID - 19 in staff / residents . Three further NHs had ≤2 staff members and no residents with confirmed COVID - 19 . All other NHs ( 21 / 28 , 75 . 0 % ) were being managed as active COVID - 19 outbreaks at the end of the study period and are included in the study . There were 1741 residents in 1972 beds across these sites ( median occupancy rate 96 . 7 % , IQR : 86 . 0 – 98 . 6 % ) on 29 / 02 / 2020 . Of all resident deaths recorded , 96 . 2 % ( 300 / 312 ) occurred in outbreak NHs with a mortality rate of 17 . 2 % ( 300 / 1741 ) . Outbreak nursing home profile An outbreak was recorded in 75 . 0 % ( 21 / 28 ) of facilities – four public and seventeen private [ Table 1 ] . Occupancy rates at the start of the study period were 95 . 1 % and 87 . 7 % in public and private NHs respectively , decreasing to 75 . 2 % in public and 73 . 2 % in private NHs by 22 / 05 / 2020 . Eight NHs ( 38 . 1 % ) had ≥80 % single rooms in line with regulatory standards [ 8 ] . There was no association between adherence to this standard and outbreak occurrence ( χ2 = 1 . 37 , p = 0 . 24 ) . COVID - 19 in Nursing Home Residents During the study period , 40 . 1 % of residents in twenty - one NHs with COVID - 19 outbreaks had a laboratory - confirmed diagnosis of COVID - 19 . Another 3 . 1 % had clinically - suspected COVID - 19 giving a total prevalence of 43 . 9 % . Over a quarter of residents with laboratory - confirmed COVID - 19 were asymptomatic [ Table 2 ] . The case - fatality rate was 25 . 8 % in those with laboratory - confirmed COVID - 19 infection . When clinically - suspected cases were included the overall case - fatality rate was 27 . 6 % .

Three NHs ( 7 . 0 % ; 3 / 21 ) with outbreaks had no COVID - 19 - related deaths . Across the remaining eighteen ( 85 . 7 % ; 18 / 21 ) , the median proportion of total residents ( as per occupancy on 29 / 02 / 2020 ) who died as result of confirmed / suspected COVID - 19 was 15 . 0 % ( range 13 . 1 - 19 . 4 % ) . Non - COVID - 19 mortality was similar in outbreak - affected NHs and unaffected NHs ( 5 . 1 % [ 89 / 1741 ] vs 4 . 0 % [ 12 / 300 ] χ 2 = 0 . 71 , p = 0 . 40 ) . Comparisons of resident outcomes between public and private NHs are biased by low number of public NHs in the sample ( 5 / 28 , 17 . 9 % ) . However , there were significantly more residents with confirmed / suspected COVID - 19 in the four public ( 106 / 157 ; 67 . 5 % ) versus seventeen private ( 620 / 1500 ; 41 . 3 % ) NHs experiencing an outbreak ( χ2 = 39 . 6 ; p < 0 . 001 ) . Similarly , the case - fatality attributable to COVID - 19 was significantly higher in public NHs ( 35 / 157 ; 22 . 3 % vs 168 / 1500 ; 11 . 2 % ; χ2 = 16 . 2 ; p < 0 . 001 ) . In eleven NHs ( 11 / 21 , 52 . 4 % ) with a first confirmed COVID - 19 case “early” in the course of the pandemic ( before 28 / 03 / 2020 ) , 45 . 4 % of residents developed confirmed / suspected COVID - 19 infection , compared to 42 . 1 % in NH with a first confirmed case after this date . NHs with “early” outbreaks had a higher number of deaths expressed as a proportion of total residents but similar case - fatality rates for residents with confirmed / suspected COVID - 19 as NHs with “late” outbreaks [ Table 3 ] . By the end of this study period 55 . 8 % ( 396 / 710 ) of residents with laboratory - confirmed COVID - 19 had recovered . A lower proportion had recovered in NHs with “early” outbreaks when compared to NHs with “late” outbreaks suggesting more prolonged outbreak in the “early” group . A greater proportion of residents with confirmed / suspected COVID - 19 were still in isolation in the “early” vs the “late” group [ Table 3 ] . Six NHs ( 6 / 21 , 28 . 6 % ) had no residents with confirmed / suspected COVID - 19 in isolation at the end of the study period ; two ( 18 . 1 % ; 2 / 11 ) in the “early” and four ( 40 . 0 % ; 4 / 10 ) in the “late” outbreak group . .

Two NHs had a staff / resident ratio < 1 , six of 1 – 2 and two with > 2 staff / resident . In NHs with a staff / resident ratio of < 1 a median of 46 . 7 % ( IQR 33 . 0 – 60 . 5 % ) of residents had confirmed / suspected COVID - 19 with a median case - fatality rate of 52 . 0 % ( IQR 45 . 3 – 59 % ) , 27 . 9 % ( IQR 17 . 9 – 38 . 2 % ) of all residents . This compared to a median proportion of confirmed / suspected COVID - 19 of 48 . 5 % ( IQR 36 . 3 – 53 . 4 % ) in residents in NHs with staff / resident ratio of 1 – 2 and 40 . 3 % ( IQR 39 . 4 – 41 . 3 % ) in those with staff / resident ratio of > 2 . In NHs with a staff resident ratio of 1 – 2 , a median of 24 . 8 % ( IQR 22 . 5 – 28 . 1 % ) of patients with confirmed / suspected COVID - 19 died ; a median of 10 . 9 % ( IQR 9 . 5 – 15 . 6 % ) of all residents . One of the two NHs with a staff / resident ratio of > 2 had no COVID - 19 related deaths during the study period . COVID - 19 in Nursing Home Staff During the study period , 675 NH staff across twenty - four sites ( 85 . 7 % ; 24 / 28 ) ( 21 outbreak and 3 sites with ≤2 staff affected ) had confirmed / suspected COVID - 19 infection . Almost a quarter ( 23 . 6 % , 159 / 675 ) were asymptomatic , identified by mass point - prevalence testing . While all NHs gave details on total staff numbers with COVID - 19 , twelve ( 42 . 9 % , 12 / 28 ) reported information relative to total staffing levels ( all grades ) . A total of 1392 staff members worked across these twelve sites with almost a quarter ( 23 . 8 % , 331 / 1392 ) reported as confirmed / suspected COVID - 19 . Over a quarter were asymptomatic ( 27 . 5 % , 91 / 331 ) . Ten of the twelve NHs ( 83 . 3 % , 10 / 12 ) met criteria for an outbreak ( one NH had no staff / residents with COVID - 19 , and another only two staff infected ) . In those NHs , 329 / 1227 ( 26 . 8 % ) of staff had confirmed / suspected COVID - 19 infection , and over a quarter were asymptomatic ( 27 . 1 % ; 89 / 329 ) . The median proportion of total staff with COVID - 19 per outbreak site was 31 . 1 % ; ( IQR 23 . 2 – 40 . 6 % ) , with 19 . 6 % ( IQR : 11 . 8 – 52 . 3 % ) of those staff being asymptomatic . Across sites , there was a significant correlation between the proportion of staff with symptomatic .

There was no significant correlation between the proportion of asymptomatic staff and number of residents with confirmed / suspected COVID - 19 ( Spearman’s rho = 0 . 18 , p = 0 . 61 ) . Total staffing levels were reported in six NHs ( 6 / 11 , 703 staff ) with “early” outbreaks and four ( 4 / 10 , 524 staff ) with “late” outbreaks . Approximately half of staff in NH with “early” outbreaks ( 50 . 8 % ; 357 / 703 , ) had confirmed / suspected COVID - 19 compared to 60 . 7 % ( 318 / 524 ) in NHs with “late” outbreaks . Almost a quarter of staff in both “early” ( 23 . 1 % ; 81 / 350 ) and “late” ( 24 . 8 % ; 78 / 314 ) NHs were asymptomatic [ Table 3 ] . Discussion This is the largest epidemiological study of NHs , residents , and staff reported in the literature to date , demonstrating the disproportionate impact of COVID - 19 on this part of the health sector . Within twenty - one NH outbreak clusters in this report , 43 . 9 % of residents and 23 . 8 % of staff had COVID - 19 over the twelve - week period ( Eighty - three - days ) . The case - fatality rate due to suspected / confirmed COVID - 19 in residents was 26 . 7 % . The mass point - prevalence exercise and contact - tracing testing revealed asymptomatic / pre - symptomatic COVID - 19 in 27 . 2 % of residents , and 27 . 5 % of staff . This case - fatality rate is in contrast to the overall Irish national case - fatality rate ( as of 06 / 06 / 2020 ) of 5 . 6 % , almost half of which are deaths attributable to NH residents . This bias in the recording of national case - fatality figures has led some commentators to suggest NH - related mortality should be examined separate to other community deaths [ 9 ] . Residents in NHs have increased comorbidities and frailty . Much of the increased mortality risk is associated with these factors . The usual annualised morality rate of residents is estimated at 31 . 8 % or 0 . 087 % / day [ 10 ] ; in this study the mortality rate was 15 . 3 % overall and 17 . 2 % in outbreak NHs over eighty - three days , equating to a daily rate of 0 . 184 % and 0 . 207 % .

With regards international comparisons on NH COVID - 19 infection rates and case - fatality , our results are consistent with a report on eighty - nine residents from a US facility [ 11 ] , with an infection rate of 64 % and a case - fatality rate of 26 % , and a series from 394 residents in four UK NHs with an infection rate of 40 % , and a case - fatality of 26 % [ 12 ] . In the UK series 43 % of residents were asymptomatic , as were 4 % ( n = 70 ) of staff . This is the first report to investigate the effect of outbreak timing . NHs impacted early in the pandemic had greater proportions of residents recovering in isolation at the end of this study compared to those who had later outbreaks , despite both having similar proportions of residents and staff infection . This suggests more prolonged outbreaks in these facilities . Scarcity of personal protection equipment , difficulty accessing testing in a timely fashion , and knowledge of atypical symptoms and asymptomatic infection were significant factors which were more challenging earlier in the pandemic . Of concern , despite progress in these areas over the course of the pandemic , similar numbers of residents and increased proportions of staff were infected , although overall mortality rates appeared lower in NHs with later outbreaks . Interestingly , staffing numbers with “symptomatic” rather than “asymptomatic” COVID - 19 correlated closely with resident infections , and may support emerging evidence that pre - symptomatic / asymptomatic carriers have lower viral loads than those with symptoms [ 13 ] . The proportions of staff infected emphasises the need for regular systematic testing in NHs . Public NHs appeared to have been impacted disproportionately severely relative to their private counterparts , although we must be cautious interpreting this finding as only five small facilities returned outcomes ( 4 with outbreaks ) . Nonetheless , there was substantially higher infection rates and case - fatality in public facilities . This may be explained by a more complex case - mix in public NHs , where residents are frailer , with higher medical and social care needs requiring greater amounts of close - contact care [ 14 ] . This is the largest series reporting the impact of COVID - 19 on NHs , residents , and staff in the literature to date . It not only includes information from a point - prevalence study , but iterative .

While all outbreak NHs in this series were still in an active period , few had active new cases in the interim following the end of this study period . There are some limitations to this study . Despite the size of the sample it represents 5 % of all Irish NHs , and 8 % of NHs with COVID - 19 clusters . Information is self - reported , although senior NH medical / nursing staff were best placed to give accurate information . We did not have information on the nature , and severity of symptoms which would be of interest in light of the reports of atypical symptoms in this cohort . Conclusion : This study demonstrates the substantial impact of COVID - 19 on NH residents and staff . Further research is required to examine factors such as the impact of staffing levels , and case - mix on outcomes , and the significance of laboratory - confirmed COVID - 19 in asymptomatic individuals .
