However , 46 missing race and ethnicity data and missed infections due to testing disparities limit the interpretation of 47 testing data and obscure the true toll of the pandemic . We investigated potential bias arising from these 48 two types of missing data through a case study in Holyoke , Massachusetts during the pre - vaccination 49 phase of the pandemic . First , we estimated SARS - CoV - 2 testing and case rates by race / ethnicity , 50 imputing missing data using a joint modelling approach . We then investigated disparities in SARS - CoV - 51 2 reported case rates and missed infections by comparing case rate estimates to estimates derived from a 52 COVID - 19 seroprevalence survey . Compared to the non - Hispanic white population , we found that the 53 Hispanic population had similar testing rates ( 476 vs . 480 tested per 1 , 000 ) but twice the case rate ( 8 . 1 % 54 vs . 3 . 7 % ) . We found evidence of inequitable testing , with a higher rate of missed infections in the 55 Hispanic population compared to the non - Hispanic white population ( 77 vs . 58 infections missed per 56 1 , 000 ) . 57 58 All rights reserved .

These communities experienced higher 61 rates of SARS - CoV - 2 infection , hospitalization , and COVID - 19 - related mortality compared to non - 62 Hispanic white populations [ 4 - 11 ] – a result of structural racism , whereby systems , policies , and 63 practices have created racial inequities in employment , housing , healthcare , and wealth [ 12 ] . Routinely 64 collected COVID - 19 testing data has been a vital resource to investigate racial and ethnic disparities in 65 COVID - 19 - related outcomes . However , a full understanding has been limited by incomplete race and 66 ethnicity data [ 13 ] and the absence of data for infected , but untested , individuals [ 3 ] . 67 Missing data on race and ethnicity is common in US COVID - 19 testing databases [ 13 , 14 ] . As of 68 August 1 , 2020 , US laboratories were required to report race and ethnicity for all COVID - 19 tests [ 15 ] . 69 Despite this , 32 % of reported cases had missing information on race and 42 % on ethnicity between 70 August 1 and December 31 , 2020 [ 16 ] . Recent studies investigating racial and ethnic disparities 71 typically exclude participants with missing information or group them into an “unknown” category for 72 analysis [ 3 , 17 ] . This can underestimate population - level testing and case rates by race and ethnicity and 73 may bias comparisons across subpopulations when information is not missing completely at random 74 [ 18 ] . 75 Missed infections occur when persons infected with SARS - CoV - 2 are not documented in testing 76 databases . Current evidence suggests that 60 % of cases in the US were unreported during the first year 77 of the pandemic [ 19 ] . The reasons for this are myriad . A large proportion of SARS - CoV - 2 infections are 78 asymptomatic [ 20 ] . Access to laboratory testing throughout the pandemic has been variable and often 79 limited [ 21 , 22 ] . Furthermore , racial and ethnic disparities in COVID - 19 testing stemming from 80 structural racism have been documented [ 11 ] . For example , a study demonstrated the extent to which 81 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

Inequities in testing will be propagated into 83 testing databases , resulting in selection bias and hindering our ability to quantify the true toll of the 84 pandemic among certain populations . 85 In this study , we investigate racial and ethnic disparities in SARS - CoV - 2 testing and cases in 86 Holyoke , Massachusetts from March 8 to December 31 , 2020 . We address potential bias due to missing 87 race and ethnicity data through multiple imputation and investigate missed infections and the impact of 88 selection bias by comparing routinely collected testing data with a population - representative 89 seroprevalence study of antibodies to COVID - 19 conducted over the study period in Holyoke [ 24 ] . 90 91 METHODS 92 Study setting . Holyoke is a post - industrial city in western Massachusetts with a population of 40 , 241 in 93 2019 [ 25 ] . Holyoke is in Hampden County , which has the highest level of social vulnerability in 94 Massachusetts per the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) ’s social vulnerability 95 index ( SVI ) , an index that uses US census data to determine the relative potential negative effects on 96 census tracts caused by external stress on human health such as disease outbreaks [ 26 ] . Over half of the 97 population identifies as Hispanic or Latino / a / x , while the remaining population is predominantly non - 98 Hispanic white ( Table 1 ) . The non - Hispanic white community primarily resides in areas of lower SVI 99 farther from the city center , with Hispanic or Latino / a / x populations residing in the city center in areas 100 of higher SVI ( Figure 1 , Supplemental Table 1 ) [ 27 ] . We use the term “Hispanic” to refer to the 101 “Hispanic or Latino / a / x” population for the remainder of the paper . 102 103 Data sources . The main data source in this study is the Holyoke COVID - 19 testing database , which 104 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

The city - level COVID - 19 testing data was managed by Massachusetts Virtual 106 Epidemiologic Network ( MAVEN ) , the state’s epidemiologic data system [ 28 ] . The data extracted for 107 this analysis did not contain names or phone numbers . 108 We also utilized data from a seroprevalence survey of COVID - 19 conducted from November 6 109 to December 31 , 2020 among residents from a simple random sample of Holyoke households [ 24 ] . The 110 study collected demographic information in addition to blood samples for serologic testing of COVID - 111 19 antibodies from 328 individuals . The seroprevalence survey only reported seroprevalence estimates 112 among Hispanic and non - Hispanic white groups due to small sample sizes among other racial and ethnic 113 groups . Lastly , we used an address list for Holyoke ( current as of June 2020 ) to map addresses to census 114 tracts . This list was also used for household sampling in the seroprevalence study . 115 This study received approval from the Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board 116 ( Protocol # 2021P001714 ) and the Harvard Institutional Review Board ( IRB20 - 1300 ) . 117 118 Study population . We utilized all available data from March 8 , 2020 through March 8 , 2021 ( 26 , 487 119 individuals with 97 , 049 tests ) to impute missing data . After imputation , to facilitate comparisons 120 between Holyoke testing data and the seroprevalence survey , we excluded testing data for Holyoke 121 residents who did not receive at least one reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) test 122 between March 8 and December 31 , 2020 . We removed individuals residing in the ten long - term care 123 facilities that were also excluded from the seroprevalence survey . Our final sample size included 19 , 658 124 individuals with 50 , 075 tests . See Supplemental Materials for details regarding data cleaning . 125 126 Key Variables . 127 All rights reserved .

Grouped gender included individuals identifying as transgender or with unknown 133 gender , and was created because of insufficient information to appropriately impute unknown gender 134 and because the small number of self - identified transgender individuals ( < 10 ) precluded valid inference . 135 3 ) Race , collapsed into white , Black , Asian , and grouped race ( other , two or more races , Native Alaskan 136 or American Indian , Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander ) and Hispanic ethnicity . Grouped race was 137 created for categories where the small sample size precluded valid inference or imputation convergence . 138 A combined race and ethnicity categorical variable was constructed for analyses : Hispanic ( any race ) , 139 non - Hispanic white , non - Hispanic Black , non - Hispanic Asian , and non - Hispanic grouped race 140 ( Supplemental Materials ) . 141 Individual - level variables also included individuals’ testing characteristics . We created a variable 142 for total number of PCR tests received and the number of weeks between March 8 , 2020 and the 143 individuals’ first COVID - 19 - related test , including PCR , rapid antigen , or antibody tests . We also 144 created indicator variables for whether the individual ever had a positive PCR test result , received an 145 antibody test and received an antigen test . 146 We analyzed four residence variables . First , an indicator for living in an apartment was created 147 based on the existence of apartment numbers in the street address . Second , we mapped addresses to their 148 respective census tracts and constructed a three - level categorical variable based on the proportion of 149 individuals in each census tract identifying as “Hispanic” in the 2019 census : 1 ) high Hispanic 150 All rights reserved .

Finally , we created a household 153 identifier that grouped individuals with the same addresses . 154 Finally , we created variables to capture the distribution of race and ethnicity for a given testing 155 provider , known as the testing provider race and Hispanic ethnicity majority variables , as testing 156 providers who order tests for a large proportion of patients with a given race or ethnicity ( determined 157 through comparison to the Holyoke census population distribution ) could be informative for imputing 158 missing race and ethnicity data . See the Supplemental Materials for details on the construction of these 159 variables . 160 161 Outcome measures . 162 Outcome measures were the positivity rate , case rate , and number of missed infections . Positivity rate is 163 the number of people with at least one positive PCR test divided by the number of people who received 164 at least one PCR test . Case rate refers to the number of people with at least one positive PCR test 165 divided by the population of Holyoke . The number of missed infections is the difference between the 166 case rate and the true SARS - CoV - 2 infection rate , which is estimated from the seroepidemiologic 167 survey . All outcomes correspond to March 8 through December 31 , 2020 . 168 169 Statistical methods . 170 Multiple imputation to address missing race and ethnicity data . For individuals with missing race and / or 171 ethnicity in the testing data , we conducted multi - level multiple imputation to account for clustering by 172 household of residence using the R jomo package [ 29 ] . jomo uses a joint modelling approach to 173 All rights reserved .

Addressing the 174 clustering of race and ethnicity enables us to utilize the racial and ethnic make - up of an individual’s 175 household when imputing their missing information . The completely observed covariates included in the 176 imputation model were the number of PCR tests ; indicators for prior positive PCR test result , prior 177 antibody test , and prior antigen test ; time to first test ( weeks ) ; household type ( house , apartment , long - 178 term care facility ) ; census tract category ; gender ; and testing provider race and Hispanic ethnicity 179 majority variables . Race and ethnicity were imputed separately , then combined into the race and 180 ethnicity categorical variable described previously . The small number missing age values were also 181 imputed . 182 We created twenty imputed datasets and used Rubin’s rules to obtain variance estimates for all 183 estimates obtained in the multiple imputation procedure . As the testing data is a population - level data 184 source , the only uncertainty comes from the imputation procedure itself , such that the within - imputation 185 variance term in Rubin’s rules vanishes . 186 187 Assessing disparities in testing , accounting for missing race and ethnicity data . We compared the 188 distribution of race and ethnicity , age , gender , and SVI between the Holyoke population ( from the 2019 189 American Community Survey ( ACS ) [ 27 ] ) and the individuals who received at least one COVID - 19 test 190 in the imputed testing data , to assess disparities in testing by demographic characteristics . This was done 191 for each variable / category by conducting two - sided one - sample t - tests with the null hypothesis that the 192 observed proportion in the imputed testing data is equal to the Holyoke population proportion , and the 193 variance estimated using Rubin’s rules . Next , we investigated the impact of missing data in the testing 194 database by comparing the distribution of these characteristics between the original and imputed testing 195 data . Finally , using the imputed data , we compared testing characteristics ( number of PCR tests , days to 196 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

We computed the 200 positivity and case rate for each race and ethnicity category among the original testing population 201 ( excluding or separating individuals with unknown race and ethnicity category ) and the imputed testing 202 population ( all individuals who received a test in Holyoke ) . This enables a comparison in rates between 203 what is typically shown on COVID - 19 data dashboards ( “original” ) , which separates ( for positivity 204 rates ) or excludes ( for case rates ) individuals with missing race and / or ethnicity , and what would be 205 expected if there was no missing data ( “imputed” ) . To examine the impact of missing data on disparities 206 in infection , we also computed the positivity and case rate ratios between the Hispanic and non - Hispanic 207 white population using both the imputed and the original testing data . A rate ratio over 1 suggests that 208 the positivity ( case ) rate in the Hispanic population is higher than that in the non - Hispanic white 209 population . To asses the impact of missing data by where individuals live , we repeated the above 210 analysis by SVI . 211 212 Assessing disparities in missed infections , accounting for missing race and ethnicity data and potentially 213 disparate testing rates . We computed the number of missed infections per 1000 individuals in each race 214 and ethnicity category by taking the difference between the case rate from the imputed testing data and 215 the estimated seroprevalence from the seroepidemiologic study . Seroprevalence is the proportion of the 216 population with IgG antibodies and represents the best estimation for the proportion of the Holyoke 217 population with a SARS - CoV - 2 infection by December 31 , 2020 . Missed infections may be preferable 218 over other metrics to assess disparities because this quantity incorporates disparities in case rates and 219 All rights reserved .

That is , missed infections may occur in the presence of disparate case rates and 220 equal testing rates , equal case rates and disparate testing rates , or both . If case rates are disparate , testing 221 rates must be correspondingly higher in the most - affected group to avoid missed infections . We 222 constructed 95 % credible intervals ( CI’s ) for the rate of missed infections in each race and ethnicity 223 category using a parametric bootstrap procedure . Again , we repeated the above analysis by SVI to 224 determine the impact of missed infections by location of residence . 225 226 RESULTS 227 In the Holyoke testing population , 23 . 0 % individuals had an unknown race and ethnicity category 228 ( n = 4531 ) , with 21 . 8 % ( n = 4286 ) missing race , 19 . 7 % ( n = 3869 ) missing ethnicity , and < 1 % missing age 229 ( n = 14 ) ( Table 1 ) . Individuals with missing race and / or ethnicity were more likely to reside in low SVI 230 census tracts , be under the age of 45 or over 84 , have a lower total number of PCR tests , have an earlier 231 week of first test , and live in a house vs an apartment . These individuals were less likely to have had an 232 antibody test or to have ever tested positive ( Supplemental Table 2 ) . 233 234 After imputing race and ethnicity , the size of the non - Hispanic Asian population in the imputed testing 235 data was slightly larger than the Holyoke population , leading to a significantly larger proportion of non - 236 Hispanic Asian individuals in the imputed testing data . Further , we found significant , but not meaningful 237 differences ( all < 1 % ) in all racial and ethnic categories between individuals who received at least one 238 test and the Holyoke population . The distribution of SVI was similar between the Holyoke population 239 and the imputed testing data . Individuals under 19 years and males were underrepresented in the 240 imputed testing data compared to the city population , while individuals aged 20 - 44 were 241 overrepresented . 242 All rights reserved .

Testing rates were similar between non - Hispanic white and Hispanic populations 244 with 476 compared to 480 per 1 , 000 individuals receiving at least one test by December 31 , 2020 . The 245 median number of tests per individual was two with 49 % of the Holyoke population having received at 246 least one test during this period ; there was no difference between the Hispanic and the non - Hispanic 247 white population in terms of number of tests . Among those who received a test , the median time to first 248 PCR test was 213 days from March 8 , 2020 , with Hispanic individuals having slightly longer time to 249 first test ( 222 vs . 204 days among non - Hispanic white individuals ) ( Table 2 ) . Antibody tests were most 250 common among the non - Hispanic white population ( 3 . 2 % had received an antibody test ) , while only 251 1 . 5 % of Hispanic individuals received an antibody test ( Table 2 ) . There were no discernible trends by 252 census tracts or density of Hispanic population in the number of PCR tests received over time ( Figure 2 ) . 253 254 Disparities in infection . The SARS - CoV - 2 test positivity rate between March 8 and December 31 , 2020 255 was 12 . 6 % , corresponding to a case rate for Holyoke of 6 . 2 % . The Hispanic population had higher 256 positivity ( 16 . 9 % ) and case ( 8 . 1 % ) rates compared to the non - Hispanic white population ( 7 . 8 % and 257 3 . 7 % , respectively ) . Analyses using testing data with a separate category for “unknown” race or 258 ethnicity , yielded a higher positivity rate across all race and ethnicity categories compared to the 259 imputed population ( Table 3 ) . Notably , the positivity rate among the unknown group was lower than the 260 complete case Holyoke population ( 3 . 4 % vs . 15 . 4 % ) . The case rates , while lower in the original testing 261 data compared to those in the imputed population , were similar , as individuals with at least one positive 262 SARS - CoV - 2 test were less likely to have missing race and ethnicity than tested individuals who never 263 had a positive SARS - CoV - 2 test ( 7 % and 12 % missing , respectively ) ; this is likely due to follow - up 264 contact tracing efforts among confirmed cases . When computed using the imputed data , both the 265 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

Findings stratified by 267 SVI were similar ( Supplemental Table 3 ) . 268 269 Disparities in missed infections . To understand how any disparities in testing could have influenced case 270 detection , we compared the case rates derived from the testing data to the seroprevalence survey . The 271 prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection as measured by IgG antibodies was estimated to be 13 . 1 % ( 6 . 9 % , 272 22 . 3 % ) in the seroprevalence survey compared to 6 . 2 % case rate in the testing data , meaning that an 273 estimated 51 . 8 % ( 9 . 2 % , 71 . 9 % ) of Holyoke SARS - CoV - 2 infections were not captured in the testing 274 data [ 24 ] . This represents about 2 , 682 missed SARS - CoV - 2 infections , or 67 missed infections per 1 , 000 275 people ( Table 4 ) . Among the Hispanic population , the estimated seroprevalence was 16 . 1 % ( 6 . 2 % , 276 31 . 8 % ) compared to an 8 . 1 % case rate in the testing data , representing about 77 ( 0 , 223 ) missed SARS - 277 CoV - 2 infections per 1 , 000 people . Among the non - Hispanic white population , the estimated 278 seroprevalence was 9 . 4 % ( 4 . 6 % , 16 . 4 % ) compared to 3 . 7 % in the testing data , representing about 58 ( 8 , 279 124 ) missed infections per 1 , 000 people . There was a higher rate of missed cases overall , as well as a 280 larger difference in Hispanic and non - Hispanic white - specific rates , among residents of high vs low SVI 281 census tracts ( Supplemental Table 4 ) . 282 283 DISCUSSION 284 In this study , we combined routinely collected public health data with rigorous statistical 285 methodology and a representative seroprevalence survey to identify disparities in SARS - CoV - 2 testing 286 and case rates by race and ethnicity in Holyoke , MA . We highlighted how missing data ( due to an 287 absence of race / ethnicity data or undetected infection ) may bias these estimates . 288 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

This finding contrasts with other studies in 292 Massachusetts and nationally [ 21 - 23 ] . Similar testing rates may be explained by the presence of two 293 " Stop the Spread " sites , public , free - of - charge mass - testing sites deployed in Massachusetts during the 294 early phases of the pandemic . However , equality in testing rates does not necessarily translate to 295 equitable testing . Higher positivity and case rates indicate a need for a higher testing rate in the Hispanic 296 population . A higher rate of missed infections in this population , suggests that , though equal , the rate of 297 testing in the Hispanic population was inadequate given the greater burden of infection . Missed SARS - 298 CoV - 2 infections preclude opportunities to reduce onward transmission , and contribute to the spread of 299 infections within these communities , further driving inequities . If perpetuated into the era of ‘test and 300 treat’ , missed infections may result in missed opportunities to reduce morbidity and other mortality . The 301 reasons underlying this testing inequity likely stem from structural barriers , that limit access to 302 healthcare even when health sites are present such as : incomplete language accessibility of messaging 303 related to Covid - 19 testing , including messaging regarding cost and insurance requirements , inflexible 304 employer sick leave policies contributing to fear of testing positive , fear of deportation amongst 305 undocumented individuals , and long wait times at testing centers , even at Stop the Spread sites where 306 demand was heightened by the influx of people coming from neighboring locales to get tested [ 30 ] . 307 Positivity rates were higher and case rates were lower in the complete cases testing data 308 compared to those in the imputed data , due to the lower rate of missing race and ethnicity information 309 among cases compared to tested individuals who never had a positive SARS - CoV - 2 test .

Case rates from testing data alone will 316 greatly underestimate the true burden of SARS - CoV - 2 infections . Testing data may still be useful for 317 comparing health outcomes between groups if the testing population is representative of the total 318 population . If not representative , the presence of selection bias should be evaluated and addressed [ 32 - 319 35 ] . 320 We utilized a multi - level multiple imputation procedure that allowed us to impute race and 321 ethnicity separately , and to account for clustering of race and ethnicity by household . Two potential 322 limitations of this procedure are that it assumes that the data are missing at random ( MAR ) [ 29 ] , and that 323 the imputation model is correctly specified ; when these assumptions do not hold , resulting estimates 324 may be biased . All variables included our imputation model were significantly associated with 325 missingness in the race and ethnicity variable ( Supplemental Table 2 ) , though we did not have access to 326 other potentially informative data such as individuals’ occupation , which may threaten the MAR 327 assumption . Future health data systems would benefit from collecting more information on 328 characteristics known to be associated with race and ethnicity . Other imputation procedures such as 329 Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding ( BISG ) [ 18 , 36 ] or population calibrated multiple imputation 330 ( PCMI ) [ 37 ] could be employed , however , these require access to individuals’ surnames or knowledge 331 of the true testing race and ethnicity distribution , respectively , neither of which we had access to in the 332 current study . Ultimately , the most appropriate strategy will depend on the available information . 333 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

Grouping race categories this way will mask true differences between groups and may 336 further marginalize these communities [ 38 ] . Second , there was no standardized method of collecting 337 race or ethnicity information at testing facilities . Prior research has shown that differences in the 338 ordering and question format for race and ethnicity data can result in inconsistent answers [ 39 , 40 ] . 339 Misclassifications at the outset would propagate into the multiple imputation procedure . We attempted 340 to mitigate this through our data cleaning process , which was informed by discussions with Holyoke 341 testing sites about how race and ethnicity data was collected . Third , there was no standardized method of 342 collecting gender at testing facilities . The testing data only had options for “male” , “female” , and 343 “transgender” with only 6 ( 0 . 03 % ) individuals listed as transgender , over ten - fold smaller than the 344 estimated percentage of transgender individuals living in Massachusetts [ 41 ] . This could be due to either 345 a disparity in testing by gender or an artefact of non - standardized data collection on gender . These data 346 issues can be obviated by instituting standardized data collection procedures at testing facilities . Finally , 347 the seroprevalence survey used to estimate the true infection rates was itself subject to several 348 limitations [ 24 ] ; in this study , these manifested as insufficient data to estimate missed infection rates 349 among all race and ethnicity groups , and wide CIs in groups where estimation was possible . Despite 350 these limitations , our analysis can serve as an example of how to investigate where and how racial and 351 ethnic disparities may lead to differential testing rates , case rates , and missed infections . 352 Routinely collected testing data is a vital resource for targeting public health responses . In this 353 study , we highlight a disproportionate burden of SARS - COV - 2 infections among the Hispanic 354 population in Holyoke and an inequity in testing between Hispanic and non - Hispanic white populations . 355 We address biases inherent to analyses using routinely collected testing data by using multiple 356 All rights reserved .
