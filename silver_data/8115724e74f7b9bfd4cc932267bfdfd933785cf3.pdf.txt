Polyclonal antibody 1 was raised in rabbit against the C - terminal fragment [ 137 – 156 ] of mouse leptin ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , and polyclonal antibody 2 was raised in rabbit against fragment [ 138 – 167 ] of mouse leptin coupled to KLH ( keyhole limpet haemocyanin ) using EDC ( 1 - ethyl - 3 - ( 3 - dimethyl - aminopropyl ) carbodiimide hydrochloride ) . The two anti - bodies gave similar results in western blot analysis and in histological studies . Immunoblots . Unfrozen samples of fundic scrapings and mesenteric adipose tissue were homogenized at 4 (cid:56) C in a RIPA buffer containing 0 . 1mgml - 1 PMSF , 100 (cid:109) M benzamidine and 100mM Na 3 VO 4 ; they were then solubilized in a boiling Laemmli buffer containing (cid:98) - mercaptoethanol .

During endocytosis , clathrin and the clathrin adaptor protein AP - 2 ( ref . 1 ) , assisted by a variety of accessory factors , help to generate an invaginated bud at the cell membrane 2 , 3 . One of these factors is Eps15 , a clathrin - coat - associated protein that binds the (cid:97) - adaptin subunit of AP - 2 ( refs 4 – 8 ) . Here we investigate the function of Eps15 by characterizing an important binding partner for its Nature © Macmillan Publishers Ltd 1998 8 letters to nature 794 NATURE | VOL 394 | 20 AUGUST 1998 region containing EH domains 9 ; this protein , epsin , is closely related to the Xenopus mitotic phosphoproteinMP90 ( ref . 10 ) and has a ubiquitous tissue distribution . It is concentrated together with Eps15 in presynaptic nerve terminals , which are sites specialized for the clathrin - mediated endocytosis of synaptic vesicles . The central region of epsin binds AP - 2 and its carboxy - terminal region binds Eps15 . Epsin is associated with clathrin coats in situ , can be co - precipitated with AP - 2 and Eps15 from brain extracts , but does not co - purify with clathrin coat compo - nents in a clathrin - coated vesicle fraction . When epsin function is disrupted , clathrin - mediated endocytosis is blocked . We propose that epsin may participate , together with Eps15 , in the molecular rearrangement of the clathrin coats that are required for coated - pit invagination and vesicle ﬁssion . The core of the binding consensus of the EH domains of Eps15 is the sequence asparagine - proline - phenylalanine ( NPF ) 11 . This sequence is present in non - neuronal isoforms of proteins of the synaptojanin and AP180 / CALM families , which have been impli - cated in clathrin - mediated endocytosis 12 – 14 . Members of these families interact with the EH domains of Eps15 and of the yeast protein Pan1 15 , 16 . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis of synaptic vesicles probably represents a specialization of the clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis typical of all cells 2 , but the nerve - terminal isoforms of AP180 and synaptojanin do not contain NPF motifs 12 , 13 , 15 , 17 , raising the possibility that Eps15 may be selectively involved in clathrin - mediated internalization of receptors and not in synaptic vesicle recycling . We therefore tested whether Eps15 , and the homologous protein Eps15R ( refs 6 , 18 ) , are concentrated in nerve endings , which would be expected for proteins that participate in synaptic vesicle endocytosis . Immunoﬂuorescence staining of frozen sections revealed differ - ential expression of Eps15 and Eps15R in various rat brain regions , but produced in all regions a predominant nerve - terminal pattern of immunoreactivity , similar to that of synaptophysin , a synaptic - vesicle membrane protein 6 , 19 ( Fig . 1a , and results not shown ) . There was an enrichment of Eps15 and Eps15R in brain relative to other tissues ( Fig . 1b ) , consistent with an important role of clathrin - dependent synaptic vesicle recycling in this tissue . We searched for nerve - terminal binding partners for the EH - domain - containing regions of Eps15 and Eps15R by reacting fusion proteins comprising glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) and these regions ( GST – EH eps15 and GST – EH eps15R , respectively ) with rat brain cytosol in a gel overlay assay . The two fusion proteins , but not GST alone ( Fig . 2a ) , speciﬁcally recognized one predominant band corresponding to a relative molecular mass of (cid:44) 94K ( referred to here as epsin , for Eps15 - interacting protein ) and minor bands of smaller molecular masses . A protein band of 94K ( p94 ) was identiﬁed previously by afﬁnity chromatography as a binding partner for the appendage domain of (cid:97) - adaptin , a subunit of the clathrin adaptor AP - 2 ( ref . 20 ) , but was not characterized further . As shown by Fig . 2 , antibodies raised against one of the three reported peptide sequences of bovine p94 speciﬁcally recognized in rat brain a protein band that co - migrated with epsin in SDS – PAGE ( Fig . 2a ) and which could be afﬁnity - puriﬁed on immobilized GST – EH eps15 ( Fig . 2b ) . The same antibodies immunodepleted epsin from rat brain cytosol ( Fig . 2c ) . Degenerate oligonucleotides designed from the reported peptide sequences of bovine p94 were used to clone by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) a fragment of rat epsin that was then used to screen a (cid:108) ZAPII rat brain complementary DNA library ( from Stratagene ) . Clone 16 ( accession no . AF018261 ) included a full - length 576 - amino - acid open reading frame ( Fig . 3 ) which contained stretches identical to the three peptides of bovine p94 , except that there was an arginine - to - lysine substitution at residue 128 . Searches of the databases revealed several related complete and partial sequences , including the yeast sequences YDL161w and YLR206w . The more closely related full - length sequence is that of MP90 , a Xenopus mitotic phosphoprotein 10 . The domain comprising the ﬁrst 165 amino acids of epsin is the most conserved phylogenetically and is present in proteins otherwise very divergent from epsin ; it appears therefore to deﬁne a new protein module . The central 150 - amino - acid region is strikingly characterized by the presence of several repeats of the triplet aspartate - proline - tryptophan ( DPW ) , which are almost completely conserved from Xenopus to rat . The Cdc2 phosphorylation site of MP90 is localized in this region 10 and is conserved in epsin . The C - terminal region of epsin contains three NPF repeats ( Fig . 3 ) , consistent with the identiﬁcation of epsin as a partner for the EH domains of Eps15 ( ref . 11 ) . By northern blotting , a 2 . 6 - kilobase ( kb ) epsin - speciﬁc band was labelled in all of several tissues tested , suggesting a housekeeping role for this protein ; epsin immunoreactivity was also detectable in all tissues by western blotting .

Nature © Macmillan Publishers Ltd 1998 8 letters to nature NATURE | VOL 394 | 20 AUGUST 1998 795 concentration of epsin was found in the brain ( Fig . 1b ) . Epsin was concentrated in nerve terminals , where it co - localized with synap - tophysin and with clathrin . It was also present , together with clathrin , in the Golgi complex ( Fig . 1a ) . In subcellular fractions of rat brain , epsin and Eps15 were co - enriched in synaptosomes ( P2 fraction ) and had a roughly parallel distribution in other fractions ( Fig . 4a ) . Epsin , like Eps15 21 , was present but not enriched , in a clathrin - coated vesicle fraction prepared according to ref . 22 , as was also found for other accessory proteins of clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis ( amphiphysin I , dynamin I , and synaptojanin I ; refs 23 , 24 and 12 , respectively ) . In contrast , intrinsic components of the clathrin coat ( clathrin , AP - 2 subunits and AP180 ) 2 were enriched in this fraction ( Fig . 4a ) . Immunogold labelling of synaptic membranes conﬁrmed a speciﬁc association of epsin with clathrin coats ( Fig . 4b ) . These results were supported by analysis of the subcellular distribution of epsin in transfected CHO cells brieﬂy permeabilized before ﬁxation . In cells with low - to - moderate expression , epsin immunoﬂuorescencehad a punctate pattern that was very similar to that of clathrin , AP - 2 and Eps15 ( Fig . 4c ) , and epsin immunogold labelled primarily clathrin - coated pits ( Fig . 4b ) . In cells with high expression , there was additional labelling of the cytoplasmic face of the plasmalemma ( not shown ) , indicating that epsin may interact with other molecules of the cortical cytoplasm besides clathrin - coated components . To conﬁrm the binding of epsin to (cid:97) - adaptin and Eps15 , and to identify binding regions for these proteins , brain cytosol was afﬁnity - puriﬁed on GST fusion proteins of the three main domains of epsin . The NPF domain bound Eps15 , as expected , whereas the DPWdomain bound (cid:97) - adaptin ( both (cid:97) a and (cid:97) c subunits ) ( Fig . 5a ) .

Nature © Macmillan Publishers Ltd 1998 8 letters to nature 796 NATURE | VOL 394 | 20 AUGUST 1998 Further analysis by gel overlay revealed that there was direct interaction not only of the NPF domain with Eps15 ( not shown , and Fig . 2a ) , but also of the DPW domain with the appendage domain of (cid:97) - adaptin ( Fig . 5b ) . As shown by an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , the latter interaction was competi - tively inhibited by the (cid:97) - adaptin binding domain of Eps15 ( the so - called DPF domain ) 4 , 7 ( Fig . 5c , and results not shown ) . Consistent with a binding of epsin and Eps15 to the same region of (cid:97) - adaptin , a 50 - amino - acid N - terminal truncation of the appendage domain of (cid:97) - adaptin abolished binding of both Eps15 4 and epsin ( Fig . 5d ) . The occurrence of these interactions in vivo was conﬁrmed by co - precipitation experiments , in which antibodies directed against epsin co - precipitated both (cid:97) - adaptin and Eps15 from a Triton X - 100 extract of a total brain homogenate ( Fig . 5e ) . However , the same antibodies co - precipitated only (cid:97) - adaptin from the cytosol ( Fig . 5f ) , suggesting that the Eps15 - epsin interaction occurs only at the membrane . If epsin acts as a link protein between AP - 2 and EH - domain - containing proteins , the overexpression of its AP - 2 - binding domain may have a dominant - negative effect on clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis . As shown by Fig . 6a – d , CY3 - transferrin uptake 25 by CHO cells is inhibited by expression of the DPW domain of epsin but not by expression of its N - terminal domain . Likewise , microinjec - tion of a GST – DPW construct in CV - 1 cells blocked the clathrin - dependent internalization of receptors for epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) ( results not shown ) . We also tested the effect of epsin disruption on clathrin - mediated endocytosis by injecting antibody into CV - 1 cells . Injection of afﬁnity - puriﬁed antibodies directed against epsin , but not of control antibodies , inhibited the inter - nalizationofbothEGF ( Fig . 6e – h ) andtransferrin ( resultsnotshown ) . Collectively , our results indicated that epsin participates in clathrin - dependent endocytosis , including endocytosis at the synapse . Epsin , like Eps15 ( ref . 21 ) , is clearly not a major intrinsic component of the clathrin coat . As proposed for Eps15 ( refs 8 , 21 ) , it may assist clathrin during oligomerization and during the progres - sive rearrangement of the clathrin lattice that leads to invagination and ﬁssion . As epsin and Eps15 can bind to each other at the membrane , they could form dynamic molecular bridges between neighbouring AP - 2 complexes . This effect may be ampliﬁed by the property of Eps15 , an elongated molecule , to form dimers and tetramers 26 . An entry in the GenBank database of a partial sequence that is likely to represent mouse epsin ( AF057285 ) reveals that epsin binds intersectin ( AF032118 ) , another EH - domain - containing pro - tein . Intersectin is homologous with DAP 160 , a Drosophila dyna - min - interacting protein 27 . Thus , epsin seems to participate in a network of protein – protein interactions that assists clathrin - mediated endocytosis and which may have additional functions in the cortical cytoplasm .

Methods Antibodies . Rabbit antibodies directed against epsin and Eps15 were obtained using the following immunogens : bovine epsin peptide ARQLVALLRDEDRL - REE 20 , GST fusion proteins of the DPWand NPF domains of epsin , and of the EH and DPF domains of Eps15 . Antibodies directed against anti - Eps15R , dynamin I , amphiphysin I and synaptojanin I have been described 15 , 18 , 23 . A monoclonalantibodydirected against the appendage domain of (cid:97) - adaptinwas fromSigma ; antibodiesdirectedagainstclathrinlightchain , synaptophysinand synaptotagmin were gifts from R . Jahn . Cloning and sequencingof epsin cDNA . Degenerate primers corresponding to two peptide sequences of bovine p94 ( ref . 20 ; NIVHNYand FQYVDR ) were usedinPCRreactionswitharatbraincDNAlibraryastemplate . A300 - bpPCR product was ampliﬁed , subcloned into a TA cloning vector ( Invitrogen ) , radiolabelled and used to screen a rat brain cDNA library ( Stratagene ) . Production and afﬁnity puriﬁcation of fusion proteins . Portions of the coding region of rat epsin encoding amino - acid residues 1 – 248 ( N - terminal domain ) , 249 – 401 ( DPW domain ) , and 402 – 576 ( NPF domain ) , were ampliﬁed by PCR using Vent polymerase ( NEB , Beverly , MA ) . PCR fragments were digested byeither Eco R1 and Sal 1 , or Eco R1 and Xho 1 , and subclonedinto the pGEX4Tseries of vectors ( Pharmacia ) . GST fusion proteins were produced and puriﬁed on a glutathione – Sepharose 4B column ( Pharmacia ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Cell transfection . Full - length epsin cDNAwas subcloned into pcDNA3 . 1 / His B ( Invitrogen ) . Epsin fragments were subcloned into pcDNA3 with an N - terminal Flag tag . These constructs were transfected in CHO cells by the lipofectamine method ( GIBCO ) and cells were analysed 18 – 24h after transfection . For CY3 - transferrin ( Molecular Probes ) uptake 25 , cells were incu - bated in the presence of the probe for 20min at room temperature before ﬁxation in 4 % paraformaldehyde / 120mM sodium phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 4 . Cell microinjections . CV - 1 cells were plated at a density of 5 (cid:51) 10 4 cells on round glass gelatin - coated overslips . Injection pressure was set at 30 – 80hPa and the injection time at 0 . 3 – 0 . 5s . Afﬁnity - puriﬁed anti - epsin polyclonal antibodiesorrabbitIgG ( JacksonImmunoresearch ) wereinjectedat1 . 2mgml - 1 . ForEGFinternalizationassay , microinjectedcellswereincubatedwith1 (cid:109) gml - 1 rhodamine – EGF ( Molecular Probes ) in DMEM medium at 4 (cid:56) C for 1h . The EGF - containing medium was then replaced with warm DMEM and cells were further incubated at 37 - C for 15min , followed in some cases by an acid wash before ﬁxation in order to remove cell - surface EGF . For transferrin internalization assay , microinjected cells were incubated with 50 (cid:109) gml - 1 rhodamine – transferrin ( Molecular Probes ) in DMEM medium at 37 (cid:56) C for 60min . Following internalization , cells were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde , and immunostained with FITC - conjugated goat anti - rabbit secondary anti - bodies ( Jackson Immunoresearch ) to identify injected cells . Nuclear counter - staining was done by incubating coverslips for 5min at 25 (cid:56) CwithDAPI ( Sigma ) . Immunoprecipitation and immunodepletion . Rat brain cytosol or a Triton X - 100 extract of a total brain homogenate ( 10mgml - 1 ) were incubated for 2h at 4 (cid:56) C with afﬁnity - puriﬁed anti - epsin IgGs or control IgG bound to protein A – Sepharose beads . Immunoprecipitates were washed three times for 5min with TBST buffer ( 20mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 150mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1mM PMSF ) , and analysed by SDS – PAGE and western blotting . For immunodep - letion of the cytosol , a largeexcessof proteinA – Sepharose precoated with IgGs directed against the bovine p94 peptide was added to the cytosol , incubated for 4h at 4 (cid:56) C and then separated by centrifugation . Electron microscopy . Immunogold labelling of synaptic membrane ( LP2 fractions ) 28 was performed as described 24 after incubation of these membranes in the presence of brain cytosol , ATP and GTP - (cid:103) - S , to increase the number of clathrin - coated endocytic intermediates 24 . Transfected CHO cells were mech - anicallydisrupted in cytosolic bufferbya nitrocellulosepaper ‘rip - off’method , then ﬁxed in 3 % formaldehyde and 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde , processed for immunogold labelling 24 while still attached on the Petri dish , and ﬁnally scraped and epon - embedded for ultrathin sectioning . ELISAassay . 96 - well microtitre plates were coated with (cid:97) - adaptin appendage domain by overnight incubation at 4 (cid:56) C with 20 (cid:109) gml - 1 appendage domain in 100mM borate buffer , pH 8 . 5 , followed by blocking with 5 % BSA . 2 (cid:109) M biotinylated DPWdomain was then added to each well in the presence of GST or GST fused to the DPF domain of Eps15 , and incubated for 2h at room temperature , followedby1hincubationwith alkaline - phosphatase - conjugated streptavidin . Colorimetric reactions were quantiﬁed by a microplate reader . Miscellaneous procedures . Rat brain homogenate was subcellular - fraction - ated as described 28 . SDS – PAGE , western blotting , gel overlays , protein assays and immunoﬂuorescence were done as described 29 . For Fig . 4c , cells were exposed to 0 . 03 % saponin in cytosolic buffer 24 for a minute before ﬁxation to elute soluble proteins . Preparation of Triton X - 100 rat brain extracts and afﬁnity - puriﬁcation methods from these extracts on immobilized GST fusion proteins were carried out as described 30 .
