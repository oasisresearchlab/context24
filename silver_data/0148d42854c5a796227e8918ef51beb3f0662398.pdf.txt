I . INTRODUCTION Biopolymer networks of semi - flexible filaments having a large bending persistent length are ubiquitous in biologi - cal cells , such as collagen , actin , microtubules , and DNA networks [ 1 ] . In many biosystems , the flexural stiffness of biopolymers is a critical physical component that sig - nificantly influences various biological properties . For in - stance , the stiffness of the cellular environment determines the morphing of a stem cell [ 2 ] . Moreover , semi - flexibility plays a vital role in biopolymer network topology and coso - lute partitioning [ 3 ] . The stiffness of the mucus layer is im - portant in its physiological functions where the mucus has the ability to restore its initial stiffness through biological processes [ 4 ] . It is also known that the stiffness of the extra - cellular matrix plays a vital role in tumor cell migration [ 5 ] . Living systems are highly dynamic and active , as they uti - lize components that convert chemical energies ( e . g . , ATPs ) from the environment into mechanical ones , driving the system out of equilibrium . The entities converting the en - ergies to motion can be regarded as active or self - propelled particles [ 6 – 8 ] . Prominent examples include motor pro - teins such as kinesin and dynein and microswimmers like E . coli bacteria [ 9 – 12 ] . The nonequilibrium diffusion dynam - ics of various active particles have been extensively explored both experimentally and theoretically [ 13 , 14 ] . Beyond the single - particle dynamics , quantitative understanding of the active particles in geometric or potential confinement , poly - meric environments , and other complex environments is a currently keen interest [ 8 , 11 , 15 – 36 ] . ∗ wonkyukim @ kias . re . kr † jeonjh @ postech . ac . kr The thermal diffusion of Brownian tracers in a polymer network has been extensively investigated . These studies reveal that various diffusion dynamics can emerge depend - ing on the physical conditions of mesh - to - particle size ra - tio , topology and stiffness of the network , and interactions between the polymer and particles [ 37 – 51 ] . In contrast , the dynamics of active tracers in polymer networks remain relatively unexplored . Limited attempts have investigated the diffusion of active particles , primarily in polymer so - lutions or melts [ 18 , 19 , 52 – 57 ] , or within random matri - ces [ 23 , 25 , 35 ] . Addressing this research gap , we recently in - troduced a computational model of active tracer particles in a flexible cubic polymer network . Through explicit simula - tions , we examined the diffusion of active tracers navigating this flexible polymer environment [ 58 ] . It turned out that geometrically trapped mesh - sized tracers can freely diffuse in the polymer network via the activeness - induced hopping mechanism . The trapped times obey an exponential law , with the mean trapped time decreasing with increased ac - tiveness ( quantified with Péclet number ) . Furthermore , ac - tive tracers always reach the regime of Fickian diffusion in the long - time limit in which the diffusivity increases with the Péclet number with three distinct scaling regimes . Beyond our previous computational study , in this work , we focus on the active diffusion of self - propelled particles in a semi - flexible polymer network . We explicitly model a semi - flexible polymer network of cubic topology with var - ious bending stiffness , simulating the diffusion of mesh - sized active particles ( i . e . , active Ornstein - Uhlenbeck par - ticles and active Brownian particles ) therein . We find that in semi - flexible networks , the characteristics of active diffu - sion are critically determined by the geometrical factor in - cluding the mesh - to - particle size ratio . We quantify how the bending stiffness impacts the characteristics of trapped and hopping dynamics of active tracers in terms of various phys - a r X i v : 2 401 . 03819v1 [ c ond - m a t . s o f t ] 8 J a n 2024 2 ical observables . While the flight length mildly decreases with the bending stiffness , the trapped time exponentially increases with it . We also present an active barrier - crossing theory to quantitatively account for the observed exponen - tial growth law of the trapped time against the bending stiff - ness . Our computational and analytic studies altogether demonstrate a significant role of the semi - flexibility of the polymer network in the active transport of tracers . The current work is structured as follows . In Sec . II , we introduce the simulated semi - flexible polymer network sys - tem and also explain the model of active tracers and the physical observables under examination . In Sec . III , we present our simulation and analytic results . For three dis - tinct tracer sizes , we investigate the properties of their re - spective active diffusion in Secs . IIIA – IIIC . Then , we present a first - passage barrier - crossing theory of an active Ornstein - Uhlenbeck particle confined to a harmonic potential in Sec . IIID . We encapsulate and discuss the main results in Sec . IV , along with the additional simulation result for ac - tive Brownian particles . Finally , conclusions are provided in Sec . V . II . MODEL AND METHODS A . The polymer network We construct a cubic network of semi - flexible polymers in three dimensions ( Fig . 1a ) , representing swollen polymer gels that we are interested in . The monomers comprising the polymer network are identical with size of σ 0 and the polymer consists of four monomers , which are intercon - nected between the nearest cross - linkers . The monomers are subject to the bonding potential U bond and the bending potential U bend . For the bonding potential , we use a bead - spring model , U bond ( r ) = k b ( r − l b ) 2 , where k b = 100 k B T / σ 20 is the spring constant [ 59 ] , and l b = σ 0 is the bond length . For the bending potential , we adopt a harmonic poten - tial U bend ( θ ) = κ ( θ − π ) 2 , where θ is the angle between two bonds , and κ is the bending stiffness ( modulus ) of the poly - mer network . The stiffness parameter κ can be converted into the persistence length ( l p ) of a semi - flexible polymer via [ 3 ] l p = 2 κσ 0 k B T . ( 1 ) Figure 1a illustrates a semi - flexible polymer network ( κ = 40 k B T ) and the polymer bending conformations are com - pared with those with different bending stiffness ( κ = 0 , 10 k B T , and 100 k B T ) . It shows that larger stiffness sup - presses the fluctuations of the polymer network in the trans - verse direction , rendering the network more rigid . In the presence of large fluctuations of the polymer network , the tracer particles therein ( red spheres in Fig . 1a ) experience a significant amount of excluded volume , thereby reducing the accessible volume of the tracers within a mesh . Fig - ure S1 in the Supplementary Material presents the bond - length and angle distributions of the polymer networks for varying κ . B . The active tracers and governing equations We consider the so - called Active Ornstein – Uhlenbeck ( AOU ) processes , in which a self - propelled , AOU particle ( AOUP ) of mass m is fueled by an active force F A in the Langevin dynamics , d r dt = v , m d v dt = − γ v + F A + ξ . ( 2 ) Here , r ( t ) is the three - dimensional position , v ( t ) is the ve - locity , γ is the friction coefficient , and ξ = ( ξ x , ξ y , ξ z ) is the thermal white noise with 〈 ξ α 〉 = 0 and (cid:173) ξ α ( t ) ξ β ( t ′ ) (cid:174) = 2 γ k B T δ αβ δ ( t − t ′ ) where α , β denote the Cartesian compo - nent . The active force , F A , is the OU process : stochastic and governed by the following equation of motion , d F A dt = − 1 τ A F A + (cid:115) 2 γ 2 v 2 p 3 τ A ξ A ( t ) , ( 3 ) where ξ A = ( ξ x A , ξ y A , ξ z A ) satisfies 〈 ξ A 〉 = 0 and (cid:68) ξ α A ( t ) ξ β A ( t ′ ) (cid:69) = δ αβ δ ( t − t ′ ) , yielding an exponentially decaying correlation in time , (cid:68) F α A ( t ) F β A ( t ′ ) (cid:69) = γ 2 v 2 p 3 δ αβ e − | t − t ′ | / τ A . ( 4 ) Here , v p represents the strength of propulsion velocity , and τ A represents the directional persistent time . This enables us to define the persistence length of AOUP’s trajectory as R p = v p τ A [ 60 , 61 ] . From Eqs . ( 2 ) – ( 4 ) , the mean - square displacement of AOUP is derived as [ 60 ] (cid:173) ∆ r 2 ( t ) (cid:174) free = 6 D th (cid:161) t − τ 0 (cid:161) 1 − e − t / τ 0 (cid:162)(cid:162) + 2 v 2 p τ A (cid:34) t − τ A (cid:161) 1 − e − t / τ A (cid:162) 1 − τ 20 / τ 2A − τ 20 τ 2A t − τ 0 (cid:161) 1 − e − t / τ 0 (cid:162) 1 − τ 20 / τ 2A (cid:35) , ( 5 ) where , D th = k B T / γ is the long - time diffusivity of a passive Brownian particle , and τ 0 = m / γ is the momentum relax - ation time . A quantity of importance representing a degree of activity of AOUPs is the Péclet number ( Pe ) , which is defined by Pe = σ tr v p D th = 3 πησ 2tr v p k B T ( 6 ) where σ tr is the AOUP’s size ( diameter ) and η is the viscosity of the medium , which satisfies the Stokes law , γ = 3 πησ tr . 3 x ∕ l 0 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 y ∕ l 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 z ∕ l 0 3 . 0 3 . 5 4 . 0 4 . 5 k B T k B T κ = 100 κ = 10 κ = 0 σ tr = 4 σ tr = 5 σ tr = 6 ( a ) ( b ) FIG . 1 .

On the right side , representative configurations of flexible and semi - flexible polymer networks with different bending stiffnesses ( κ = 0 , 10 k B T , and 100 k B T ) are shown . ( b ) Representative ‘trapped - and - hopping’ trajectory of a mesh - sized active tracer in the semi - flexible polymer network . The color code depicts the elapsed time ( from yellow to blue ) . We use the tracer diameter σ tr = 5 , the Péclet number Pe = 18 , and the stiffness κ = 40 k B T . C . Non - boned interactions and simulations We employ the Lennard – Jones potential for the non - bonded interactions between particles i and j , U i j LJ (cid:161) r i j (cid:162) =   4 ϵ i j (cid:183)(cid:179) σ ij r ij (cid:180) 12 − (cid:179) σ ij r ij (cid:180) 6 (cid:184) − U c , r i j ≤ r c 0 , r i j > r c . ( 7 ) Here , r i j is the distance between two particles and σ i j = 12 (cid:161) σ ii + σ j j (cid:162) , r c = 2 . 5 σ i j is the cut - off length , and U c = 4 ϵ i j (cid:104) 1 2 . 5 12 − 12 . 5 6 (cid:105) . We use ϵ m m = ϵ m c = ϵ c c = ϵ m tr = ϵ c tr = 0 . 1 k B T , which represents the repulsive interactions ( ex - cluded volumes ) between the monomers ( m ) , cross - linkers ( c ) , and tracers ( tr ) [ 62 ] . For an infinitely dilute condition , we use ϵ tr tr = 0 , similarly to our previous study [ 58 ] . We run Langevin dynamics simulations incorporating the system setup and interactions described above . The equa - tion of motion of i - th monomer is d r i dt = v i , m d v i dt = − γ i v i −∇ i U m + ξ i . ( 8 ) Here , −∇ i U m is the force acting on the i - th monomer , where the total potential is U m = (cid:80) i j (cid:163) U bond ( r i j ) + U LJ ( r i j ) (cid:164) + (cid:80) θ U angle ( θ ) , and γ i = 3 πησ i is the friction coefficient . For the k - th AOUPs as tracers , the equation of motion is d r k dt = v k , m d v k dt = − γ k v k −∇ k U + F A , k + ξ k , ( 9 ) where U = (cid:80) i j [ U LJ ( r i j ) ] is the tracer’s total LJ potential . The stochastic active force F A , k ( t ) is generated based on Eq . ( 3 ) for each tracer of index k , for which we consider 100 tracers and τ A = 10 . We use the LAMMPS simulation pack - age [ 63 ] to run the above coupled equations of motions with the self - written input scripts . We use the LJ unit , which sets the unit length σ 0 and unit time t 0 = (cid:113) m σ 20 (cid:177) k B T . The sim - ulation box is of size 35 × 35 × 35 and periodic , in which seven cross - linkers exist per one linear polymer ( total 7 × 7 × 7 cross - linkers ) . We use the time step δ t = 0 . 001 and the total run time is typically T = 5 × 10 7 δ t . D . Mean - square displacement , non - Gaussian parameter , trapped times , and flight lenghts From the relative particle position at time t , r rel , i ( t ) = r i ( t ) − r cm ( t ) , where r i ( t ) is the i - th particle’s position and r cm ( t ) is the center - of - mass position of the system , we quantify the characteristic of trapped - and - hopping dynam - ics by measuring the mean - square displacement ( MSD ) , non - Gaussian parameter ( NGP ) , trapped time ( τ ) , and flight length ( l ) . We define MSD as (cid:173) ∆ r 2 rel ( t ) (cid:174) = 1 N N (cid:88) i 1 T − t (cid:90) T − t 0 (cid:161) r rel , i ( t ′ + t ) − r rel , i ( t ′ ) (cid:162) 2 dt ′ , ( 10 ) where N denotes the number of tracers ( N = 100 ) . From the MSD data , we select a time interval , in which t > 20 and the MSD exponent α = d log 〈 r 2rel ( t ) 〉 d log t falls within the range 0 . 95 < α ( t ) < 1 . 05 . We then fit the MSD via 〈 r 2rel ( t ) 〉 = 6 D L t , where long - time diffusivity ( D L ) is the fitting param - eter . We define NGP ( t ) from the relative position r rel , i ( t ) , such that NGP in one dimension is NGP ( t ) = 〈 ∆ x 4 ( t ) 〉 3 〈 ∆ x 2 ( t ) 〉 2 − 1 , ( 11 ) where x is one of the Cartesian components for the relative position , t is the time lag , and the bracket 〈·〉 represents both time and ensemble average [ 58 ] . 4 We employ a bilateral filter to skeletonize obtained trajec - tories [ 58 , 64 ] and collect trapped states and hopping states . Based on this , we calculate average trapped times and flight lengths . III . RESULTS From the simulations , we observe that small tracers ( ei - ther passive or active ) of size σ tr ≈ 1 diffuse inside the poly - mer network relatively freely . The polymer network acts as a trivial obstacle , thus the tracers’ diffusion is suppressed by the percolated geometry , which is qualitatively similar to the free diffusion with decreased mobility [ 58 ] ( Fig . A1 ) . However , we observe different diffusion dynamics when the tracer size becomes comparable to the mesh size of the network ( l 0 ≈ 5 ) , featuring the trapped - and - hopping mech - anism [ 58 ] . For instance , Fig . 1b shows a typical trapped - and - hopping trajectory of a mesh - sized ( σ tr = 5 ) AOUP tracer ( of Pe = 18 ) in a semi - flexible polymer network ( κ = 40 k B T ) . Our main interest lies in the effects of polymer semi - flexibility on such trapped - and - hopping diffusion dynam - ics of AOUPs . In the following , we consider three different AOUP tracer sizes : σ tr = 4 , σ tr = 5 , and σ tr = 6 ( Fig . 1a ) . We vary Pe in the range of 0 – 54 for σ tr = 4 , 0 – 90 for σ tr = 5 , and 0 – 180 for σ tr = 6 , respectively . A . AOUPs with σ tr = 4 First , we examine the case in which the tracer size is marginally smaller than the mesh size of the polymer net - work , i . e . , σ tr = 4 ≲ l 0 = 5 . Figure 2a shows x ( t ) of the tracer in a flexible polymer network ( κ = 0 ) . Depending on Pe , the trajectory shows the occasional hopping dynamics , the dis - tance of which increases with larger Pe . Such tendencies are still observed even for semi - flexible networks of κ > 0 , i . e . , the hopping dynamics is nearly independent of κ ( data not shown ) . Figure 2b shows the tracers’ MSD ( t ) for different Pe and κ . We find that the diffusion dynamics is almost indepen - dent of κ ( different symbols with the same color ) , imply - ing that the AOUP of σ tr = 4 is still small and its hopping is subject to minimal contacts with the polymers . The red symbols depict the MSD of passive tracers ( Pe = 0 ) , show - ing the ballistic short - time regime ( MSD ∼ t 2 ) before reach - ing the momentum relaxation time ( t ≲ τ 0 = 1 . 2 ) , and the long - time hopping dynamics ( t ≳ 〈 τ 〉 ≈ 50 ) that is Fickian ( MSD ∼ t 1 ) . Here , 〈 τ 〉 is the mean trapped time . In the inter - mediate time ( τ 0 ≲ t ≲ 〈 τ 〉 ) , the exponent α of MSD ( t ) ∼ t α becomes smaller than unity , signifying the caging effect be - fore reaching the normal diffusion ( α = 1 ) . The blue sym - bols represent the MSD of active tracers with Pe = 7 , show - ing the almost immediate crossover from the ballistic to Fickian dynamics without any significant intermediate sub - diffusive time domain . This reflects that in the trapped state during the time in the range of τ 0 ( ≈ 1 ) ≲ t ≲ 〈 τ 〉 ( ≈ 15 ) , the active force ( increasing α ) and the trapping force ( decreas - ing α ) become comparable and compete with each other , resulting in the exponent α close to unity . When the ac - tiveness increases ( Pe = 18 ) , as shown by the green sym - bols , the activated hopping dynamics dominates , yielding the trapped time very short ( 〈 τ 〉 ≈ 5 ) . The resultant MSD reveals three temporal regimes divided by the momentum relaxation time ( τ 0 ≈ 1 ) and the directional persistent time ( τ A = 10 ) . In the short - time regime ( t ≲ τ 0 ) , similarly to the previous cases , the tracers undergo the ballistic dynamics featuring α = 2 . In the intermediate time ( τ 0 ≲ t ≲ τ A ) , how - ever , the competition between the activeness and trapping force yields α ≈ 1 . 5 . In the long - time regime , the MSD ex - hibits the Fickian dynamics with α = 1 eventually . Figure 2c depicts the NGP of the tracers with Pe = 7 . The NGP is maximized at the timescale that the tracer starts to encounter the polymer networks as obstacles . Similarly to the MSD , we find that the overall behavior of NGPs barely depends on the polymer network’s stiffness . However , the magnitude of the peaks slightly varies depending on κ , in - creasing with κ for the semi - flexible polymers . This effect is more dramatic for larger tracers , which we discuss further in the following sections . Figures 2d , 2e , and 2f show the mean trapped time , the mean flight length , and the long - time diffusivity , as a func - tion of κ , respectively . ( The distributions of the trapped times and flight lengths are present in Figs . S2 and S3 ) . Those key quantities of our interest are not significantly de - pendent on the polymer stiffness , in line with the tendency we find from x ( t ) and MSD . B . AOUPs with σ tr = 5 Now we consider AOUPs whose size is equal to polymer network’s mesh size ( σ tr = l 0 = 5 ) . For a limiting reference , we also consider a network comprising rigid rod - like poly - mers ( κ → ∞ ) , the conformational fluctuation of which van - ishes . Figure 3a shows MSDs of passive tracers ( Pe = 0 ) for dif - ferent κ . As similarly found in the previous section , we find that the MSD in the short - time ballistic regime ( t ≲ τ 0 ) varies less sensitively with κ . The subsequent time regime exhibits the pronounced caged dynamics in τ 0 ≲ t ≲ 〈 τ 〉 , af - ter which the long - time Fickian dynamics reflects the hop - ping dynamics between network meshes . The upper inset in Fig . 3a highlights two intriguing fea - tures of the short - time dynamics . One is the enhance - ment of MSD with increasing κ at very short time ( t ≲ 1 ) . The conformational fluctuation of the flexible polymer net - work is larger than that of the semi - flexible polymer net - works . This implies that the effective free volume acces - sible to the tracers is larger for stiffer networks . There - fore , the polymer networks with larger κ enhance the mag - nitudes of short - time MSDs . The other notable feature is the bounce - back dynamics , i . e . , the oscillatory behavior of MSDs . This occurs when AOUPs bounce back and forth within a network mesh . We find that the bounce - back dy - 5 Pe = 0 Pe = 7 Pe = 18 0 200 400 600 800 1000 t −15 −10 −5 0 x ( t ) ∕ l 0 κ = 0 ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) ( e ) ( f ) 10 −1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 t 10 −2 10 0 10 2 10 4 ⟨ Δ r 2 r e l ( t ) ⟩ ∼ t 1 . 5 ∼ t 2 ∼ t κ = 0 κ = 20 k B T κ = 100 k B T Pe = 0 Pe = 7 Pe = 18 κ = 0 κ = 10 k B T κ = 20 k B T κ = 100 k B T 10 −1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 t 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 N G P ( t ) Pe = 7 0 25 50 75 100 κ ∕ k B T 10 1 ⟨ τ ⟩ Pe = 0 Pe = 5 Pe = 7 Pe = 18 Pe = 36 Pe = 54 0 25 50 75 100 κ ∕ k B T 10 1 ⟨ l ⟩ ∕ l 0 0 25 50 75 100 κ ∕ k B T 10 0 10 1 10 2 D L FIG . 2 .

For the same polymer network system , the overdamped AOUP does not exhibit the bounce - back dynamics ( See our supplemen - tary overdamped Langevin dynamics simulation in Fig . S4 ) . For large κ , the bounce - back dynamics becomes more pro - nounced , yielding large oscillatory MSDs . This tendency changes in the subsequent confined dy - namics ( see the lower inset in Fig . 3a ) . For semi - flexible net - works of stiffness up to κ = 20 k B T , the accessible free vol - ume increases and the MSDs become larger . But for stiffer networks ( κ > 20 k B T ) , the shape of the potential of mean force , whose energy barrier is larger than the one of a flexi - ble network ( κ = 0 ) , comes into a major play , resulting in de - creasing MSDs with κ ( see Fig . A2a for the potential of mean force ) . When the activeness of AOUPs is larger ( Pe = 18 ) , as shown in the inset of Fig . 3b , we find that the bounce - back dynamics disappear for κ < κ ∗ ≈ 20 k B T , implying that the critical stiffness κ ∗ ( Pe ) exists , above which the bounce - back dynamics occurs . In addition , as shown in Fig . 3b , the short - time dynamics ( t < 1 ) barely depends on κ and the activated tracers undergo the later escape dynamics easily , resulting in the shortened intermediate confined dynamics . When Pe is very large ( Pe = 72 ) , as shown in Fig . 3c , the active force dominates over the trapping force and we ob - serve the similar tendency of MSD ( α > 1 ) found in Fig . 2b . There occurs a crossover between the superdiffusive , inter - mediate , and Fickian dynamics , divided by the momentum relaxation time τ 0 and the directional persistent time τ A , in which the exponent value varies ( α = 1 . 3 – 1 . 6 ) in the in - termediate time . Nevertheless , unlike in the small AOUPs’ case , the MSD largely depends on κ and its magnitude de - creases with κ . Below the MSDs , in Figs . 3d – f , we show NGPs in the same time axes . We find that the NGPs have a peak ( maximally non - Gaussian ) at a certain intermediate time . The verti - cal lines depict this peak time of NGP , respectively , for dif - ferent κ , and the solid symbols depict the corresponding MSDs at the peak time . What we first find is that the peak time of NGP increases as κ increases . However , the peak time becomes shorter and less dependent on κ for large Pe ( see Figs . 3e and 3f ) . Although the peak time of NGP tends to be almost independent of κ for large Pe , the mag - nitude of peak increases with κ , unlike NGP for the case of Pe = 0 . This means that the non - Gaussian dynamics is dic - tated by the high competition between the activeness and the trapping force enhanced by increasing κ , the mecha - nism of which is well captured by Fig . 3e at Pe = 18 where NGP’s magnitude is around five times larger than the other cases ( trapping dominant at Pe = 0 and activeness domi - nant at Pe = 72 ) . This feature is also captured by the van - Hove self - correlation functions [ 58 ] ( Fig . S5 ) . The trapped - and - hopping dynamics is also characterized by the mean trapped time 〈 τ 〉 and the mean - square flight length 〈 l 2 〉 . Figure 3g shows 〈 τ 〉 as a function of κ . In stark contrast to the small tracers ( σ tr = 4 ) , the mean trapped time of larger tracers depends on κ significantly . Notably , for the range of Pe explored , 〈 τ 〉 increases exponentially with the bending stiffness κ . In the plot , the dashed line depicts the best exponential fit to the simulation data . The stiffness - induced increase in 〈 τ 〉 is in line with the κ - dependent ten - dency in MSD and NGP ( Figs . 3a and 3d ) . The slope of the exponential growth tends to decrease as the activeness of the tracer is larger . In the limit of very large Pe , AOUPs can jump to other meshes very easily even in a stiff polymer net - work in which the mean trapped time does not depend on κ . Apart from the mean trapped time , we also examine the distribution of trapped times at Pe = 0 , 12 , and 72 ( Fig . S6 ) . As in the case of a flexible polymer network [ 58 ] , the distri - butions are always exponentially decaying ones regardless of the bending stiffness . Here , the effect of the bending stiff - ness enters in the characteristic time of the distribution , i . e . , 〈 τ 〉 . In Fig . 3h , we show 〈 l 2 〉 as a function of κ . As expected , the flight length becomes larger with increasing Pe for all κ values investigated . By contrast , the κ - dependence in 〈 l 2 〉 is nontrivial . For small Pe of ≲ 18 , the flight length is al - most independent of κ . In this regime , the mesh - induced trapping force dominates over the active force , so hopping events are restricted to the nearest - neighbor jump only . For larger Pe of ≳ 54 , the active tracer can escape from trap - ping and jump over multiple mesh distances . This is indeed shown in the flight length distribution plotted in Fig . S7 . In this case , the hopping active tracer tends to feel increasing polymer friction as the network is stiffer , so 〈 l 2 〉 decreases with κ . Notably , beyond a certain bending stiffness , the tracer effectively sees a very similar polymer environment against increasing κ , thus exhibiting a plateau in 〈 l 2 〉 . In Fig . 3i , we show the long - time diffusivity D L as a func - tion of κ for different Pe . For small Pe , D L is a decreasing function of κ , while for large Pe it becomes nearly indepen - dent of κ due to the excessively high activeness . We can quantitatively explain the behavior of D L using the follow - ing relation [ 58 ] D L = 1 6 〈 l 2 〉 〈 τ 〉 + 〈 τ fl 〉 , ( 12 ) depicted by the solid lines in Fig . 3i . As κ increases , the flight length tends to decrease ( Fig . 3h ) while the trapped time increases ( Fig . 3g ) . In addition , the mean flight time 〈 τ fl 〉 is found to be a decreasing function of κ ( Fig . A3a ) . Inter - estingly , at large Pe values , the magnitude of 〈 τ fl 〉 becomes comparable with that of 〈 τ 〉 and their variation tendency is opposite against increasing κ . Consequently , 〈 τ 〉 and 〈 τ fl 〉 offset each other and the denominator in Eq . ( 12 ) becomes nearly independent of κ , resulting in a decreasing D L with κ mainly due to 〈 l 2 〉 . C . AOUPs with σ tr = 6 Lastly , we study the case where the AOUP tracer size is slightly larger than the network mesh size ( σ tr = 6 ≳ l 0 = 5 ) , as shown in Fig . 1a . 7 10 −1 ⟨ Δ r 2 r e l ( t ) ⟩ ∼ t 1 . 71 10 0 10 2 10 4 ⟨ Δ r 2 r e l ( t ) ⟩ ∼ t 1 . 8 ∼ t κ = 0 κ = 20 k B T κ = 60 k B T κ = 100 k B T κ = 10000 k B T κ = ∞ 10 0 10 2 10 4 10 6 ⟨ Δ r 2 r e l ( t ) ⟩ ∼ t 1 . 4 ∼ t ∼ t ( c ) ( b ) ( a ) ( d ) ( e ) ( f ) ( i ) ( h ) ( g ) 10 0 10 1 2×10 −1 3×10 −1 4×10 −1 10 0 10 1 10 0 10 1 10 0 10 1 10 0 10 1 10 1 10 2 3×10 −1 4×10 −1 10 −1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 t 0 . 00 0 . 05 N G P ( t ) 10 −1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 t 0 25 N G P ( t ) κ = 0 κ = 20 κ = 60 κ = 100 10 −1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 t 0 25 N G P ( t ) 0 25 50 75 100 κ ∕ k B T 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 ⟨ τ ⟩ Pe = 36 Pe = 54 Pe = 72 Pe = 108 Pe = 180 0 25 50 75 100 κ ∕ k B T 10 2 10 3 ⟨ l 2 ⟩ 0 25 50 75 100 κ ∕ k B T 10 −3 10 −2 10 −1 10 0 10 1 D L FIG . 4 . MSD of tracers of size σ tr = 6 for ( a ) Pe = 0 , ( b ) Pe = 72 , and ( c ) Pe = 108 . NGP for ( d ) Pe = 0 , ( e ) Pe = 72 , and ( f ) Pe = 108 . ( g ) Mean trapped time 〈 τ 〉 , ( h ) mean - square flight length 〈 l 2 〉 , and ( i ) long - time diffusivity D L , as a function of κ , respectively . Solid lines in ( i ) depict D L in Eq . ( 12 ) . Figure 4a depicts the MSD of passive tracers ( Pe = 0 ) for different κ . In contrast to the previous case ( σ tr = 5 ) , the short - time MSD ( in t < 1 ) is found to be independent of the bending stiffness . This is because the accessible volume for the large tracer is very small regardless of the magnitude of bending stiffness κ . However , at longer times of 1 < t < 10 , the tracers are in contact with the polymers , exhibiting MSD decreasing as κ increases ( Fig . 4a , left inset ) , similarly found in the previous case of σ tr = 5 . For t > 10 , MSD increases with κ up to κ = 20 k B T , beyond which it decreases ( Fig . 4a , right inset ) . Similarly to the tracer of σ tr = 5 , the observed bounce - back dynamics from the oscillatory behavior of the short - time MSD is pronounced in stiffer networks . As afore - mentioned , the observed oscillatory behavior is the conse - quence of the underdamped AOUP dynamics in a confin - ing mesh . The bounce - back effect is found to be absent in the overdamped dynamics simulation of AOUPs in the same polymer network ( Fig . S8 ) . When AOUPs have a sufficiently high self - propulsive force ( Pe = 72 ) , as shown in Fig . 4b , the hopping process starts to occur in 10 ≲ t ≲ 100 . At this activeness regime , three distinctive dynamics are observed : The tracer dynam - ics is ballistic in t ≲ τ 0 and Fickian in t ≳ 〈 τ 〉 . In the intermediate time ( τ 0 ≲ t ≲ 〈 τ 〉 ) , the tracer is subject to the viscoelastic feedback by the confining mesh . This re - sults in intriguing MSD profiles , which illustrate intricate κ - dependent dynamics arising from the competition be - tween the mechanical trapping force from the network and the self - propulsive force from the tracer . The inset ( Fig . 4b ) shows the short - time MSD . The amplitude of MSDs tends to decrease with κ . Figure 4c shows MSDs of the tracers at an extremely large Pe value ( Pe = 108 ) in which the hopping processes become dominant . Similarly found in Fig . 3c , MSDs show super - diffusive - to - Fickian crossover dynamics at around the di - rectional persistent time τ A = 10 . In the intermediate time , the amplitude of MSDs decreases and the exponent α ( t ) is lowered to unity as κ increases . Below the MSD plots , in Figs . 4d – f , we show NGPs in the same time axes . ( See also the van - Hove self - correlation functions in Fig . S9 ) . Figure 4d is for the passive tracer where no hopping events occur . We find the NGPs to oscillate in the short time , which reflects the bounce - back dynamics in the MSD . Overall , the magnitude of NGPs is small ( ∼ 10 − 2 ) , suggesting that the potential of mean force is expected be a harmonic function ( Fig . A2b ) . Figure 4e shows the NGPs for AOUPs with Pe = 72 . We find that the NGP has a broad peak , particularly with a shoulder for large κ . Similarly found in Fig . 3e , the peak time and value of the NGP increase with κ . For Pe = 108 ( Fig . 4f ) , the peak time of the NGP becomes less κ - dependent . However , its magnitude increases with in - creasing κ increases due to the responsive network . Such a tendency of NGP is similarly found in Fig . 3f , but the magni - tude of NGP is larger by a factor of 10 when σ tr = 6 , signyfing a huge difference in the tracer’s dynamics between σ tr = 5 and σ tr = 6 . Figure 4g depicts the mean trapped time of AOUPs as a 8 function of κ for different Pe . Similarly to the case of σ tr = 5 , the mean trapped time becomes shorter by larger active - ness . Additionally , the mean trapped time increases expo - nentially with κ . From this relation , it can be deduced that ln 〈 τ 〉 ∼ κ / ( k B T ) in which κ predominantly modulates an energy barrier for hopping into the nearest mesh . We also confirm that the trapped time is exponentially distributed ( Fig . S10 ) , as the tracer of σ tr = 5 shows . In the following section , we shall explain the observed exponential law for the mean trapped time using a first - passage time theory of AOUPs . Figure 4h illustrates the mean - square flight length 〈 l 2 〉 as a function of κ for Pe ≥ 36 . As observed in the results of σ tr = 5 , 〈 l 2 〉 is nearly independent of κ for small Pe values . On the other hand , for large Pe values of > 108 , multiple - mesh - hopping events freely occur ( Fig . S11 ) in which the hopping distance is on average shorter as the polymeric friction increases with the bending stiffness . Finally , in Fig . 4i , we show the long - time diffusivity as a function of κ for different Pe . The simulation results ( sym - bols ) and the theoretical prediction [ Eq . ( 12 ) ] depicted by the solid lines are compared , showing a good agreement ( The mean flight times 〈 τ fl 〉 in Fig . A3b ) . When Pe is small ( Pe = 54 ) , 〈 τ 〉 dominates over 〈 τ fl 〉 and 〈 l 2 〉 is indepen - dent of κ , resulting in an exponentially decaying D L . For large Pe , the exponential tendency is disrupted because κ - dependent 〈 l 2 〉 and 〈 τ fl 〉 come into play . D . Active escape dynamics The above trapped - and - hopping diffusion can be con - ceptualized as an escaping process of AOUPs from a con - fining potential and hopping to the nearest mesh . In this context , we explain the mean trapped times 〈 τ 〉 in terms of a barrier - crossing time ( τ e ) of a diffusing particle within a confining potential . As supported by the potential of mean force ( Fig . A2 ) , we approximate the confining potential as a harmonic potential within a minimal model framework . We then calculate the mean - first passage time of an AOUP un - der two absorbing boundaries located at the mesh bound - ary . From this perspective , we present the analysis of active escape dynamics from the analogy of harmonic potential , as depicted in Fig . 5a . The overadmped AOUP dynamics in a 1 - D harmonic po - tential V eff ( x ) = 12 kx 2 is described by the following Langevin equation γ dx ( t ) dt = − kx ( t ) + ξ th ( t ) + F A ( t ) ( 13 ) and , equivalently , by the two - variable ( x and F A ) Fokker – Planck equation ∂ p ∂ t = 1 γ ∂ ∂ x [ kx − F A ] p + k B T γ ∂ 2 p ∂ x 2 + 1 τ A ∂ ∂ F A (cid:163) F A p (cid:164) + γ 2 v 2 p τ A ∂ 2 p ∂ F 2A . ( 14 ) Here , p ( x , F A , t ) is the probability density that the position and the active force of the AOUP are found to be x and F A at time t , respectively . Because ξ th and F A are both Gaus - sian noises , the stationary distribution for the above Fokker - Planck equation is given by a bivariate Gaussian distribu - tion , i . e . , p st ( x , F A ) ∼ exp (cid:163) − 12 ( x , F A ) Σ − 1 ( x , F A ) T (cid:164) where Σ is the covariance matrix . From this , we obtain the expression for the steady - state distribution of the position p st ( x ) ∼ exp   − 12 kx 2 k B T + γ 2 τ A v 2 p k τ A + γ   = exp (cid:195) − 12 kx 2 k B T eff (cid:33) . ( 15 ) The last expression allows us to introduce the effective tem - perature of an AOUP k B T eff = k B T + ( k B T ) 2 τ A σ 2tr ( k τ A + γ ) Pe 2 , ( 16 ) consistent with the expression in Ref . [ 67 ] . Equation ( 15 ) suggests that the AOUP’s asymptotic long - time confine - ment dynamics can be mapped onto that of a Brownian par - ticle in a harmonic potential at T = T eff . Our analytic calcu - lation shows that the barrier - crossing time τ e of an AOUP in the harmonic potential V eff ( x ) is the Kramers time with the effective temperature : τ e ∼ exp (cid:181) V k B T eff (cid:182) = exp   V k B T (cid:179) 1 + k B T τ A σ 2tr ( k τ A + γ ) Pe 2 (cid:180)   ( 17 ) where V is the potential barrier height at the absorbing boundaries ( Fig . 5a ) . The above expression advances the re - sult in Ref . [ 68 ] in that it explicitly contains the role of the ambient heat bath ( T ) . In our framework , the details of the effective potential V are modulated by the system’s physical properties , such as the bending stiffness and the mesh - to - particle size ratio . For a small bending regime , the effective potential can be reasonably approximated to V ≃ V 0 + V 1 κ k B T ( 18 ) where V 0 is the potential for a flexible polymer network and the next term is responsible for the potential increase when the polymer network gains stiffness with a bending modu - lus κ . Combining Eqs . ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) , we obtain the barrier - crossing time τ e as follows : τ e = τ ( fl ) e exp   V 1 k B T (cid:179) 1 + τ A k B T σ 2tr ( k τ A + γ ) Pe 2 (cid:180) κ k B T   ( 19 ) where τ ( fl ) e is the mean escape time in the limit of a flexi - ble polymer network ( κ → 0 ) . Note that Eq . ( 19 ) includes two undetermined potential constants of a given polymer network : V 1 and the spring constant k , which depend on some physical parameters , e . g . , the mesh - to - particle size ra - tio . Because both constants are independent of κ , we antici - pate that the mean escape ( i . e . , trapped ) time of an AOUP in 9 ( a ) ( b ) 10 1 10 2 Pe 10 −3 10 −2 10 −1 l og ( τ e ∕ τ ( f l ) e ) κ ∕ k B T ∼Pe −2 ∼Pe −2 σ tr = 5 σ tr = 6 V eff ( x ) = 12 kx 2 AOUP a b s o r b i ng bound a r y a b s o r b i ng bound a r y V FIG . 5 .

The symbols are from our simulation data and the solid lines are from Eq . ( 21 ) . For σ tr = 5 ( red line ) , the fitting parameters are V 1 = 0 . 063 k B T and k = 15 . 55 k B T / σ 20 . For σ tr = 6 ( blue line ) , the fitting parameters are V 1 = 0 . 84 k B T and k = 11 . 19 k B T / σ 20 . a polymer network follows an exponential law of the form : τ e = τ ( fl ) e exp (cid:181) C κ k B T (cid:182) ( 20 ) where the prefactor C = C ( Pe , σ tr ) reads C ( Pe , σ tr ) = log (cid:179) τ e / τ ( fl ) e (cid:180) κ / k B T = V 1 k B T (cid:179) 1 + k B T τ A σ 2tr ( k τ A + γ ) Pe 2 (cid:180) ( 21 ) explaining the stiffness effects on the active escaping dy - namics . Our theory , Eq . ( 20 ) , describes the exponential growth law of the mean trapped times of AOUPs observed in our simulation ( Figs . 3g and 4g ) . We obtain two important properties of the active escap - ing process from Eq . ( 19 ) . First , the effect of bending stiff - ness , C ( Pe , σ tr ) , illustrates different behaviors on small and large Pe regimes . When Pe is small , the active escaping dy - namics barely depends on the network stiffness ( i . e . , C ≃ V 1 k B T ) . However , when Pe is increased , the stiffness factor C decays as C ∼ Pe − 2 with Pe . In Fig . 5b , we plot the mean trapped time in the form of log (cid:179) τ e / τ ( fl ) e (cid:180) κ / k B T as a function of Pe from our simulation data , along with Eq . ( 21 ) [ solid line ] . When σ tr = 5 , the theoretical line is plotted with V 1 deter - mined from the Brownian case ( Pe = 0 ) in Fig . 3g and k be - ing a fitting parameter . When σ tr = 6 , since a hopping event is rarely observed during our simulation time , we fit the data with Eq . ( 21 ) , with V 1 and k being the fitting parameters . Our simulation results in Fig . 5b indeed demonstrate that the stiffness factor C illustrates the theoretically expected two scaling behaviors . The parameter V 1 ( σ tr ) quantifies the slope of potential increase as the polymer network stiffens . Our above anal - ysis reveals that V 1 ( σ tr = 5 ) = 0 . 063 k B T and V 1 ( σ tr = 6 ) = 0 . 84 k B T . Note that V 1 ( σ tr = 6 ) ≫ V 1 ( σ tr = 5 ) , reflecting that the effect of polymer stiffness on the active escape dynam - ics is dramatically amplified as a tracer is larger . Moreover , as Fig . 5b shows , the stiffness effect is larger than an order of magnitude for the tracer size of σ tr = 6 than σ tr = 5 . This also confirms that the stiffness effect on the active escape is dramatically increased when the tracer size increases . IV . DISCUSSION We studied the diffusion dynamics of active tracer parti - cles in a semi - flexible polymer network by performing un - derdamped Langevin dynamics simulations . The observed tracer dynamics spans a wide time scale , ranging from the short - time ballistic dynamics to the long - time diffusive dy - namics . For mesh - sized tracers that are tightly trapped in the network , we observed the bounce - back dynamics in the short - time regime [ 60 , 65 , 69 ] , manifested by oscillations in MSDs and NGPs ( Figs . 3 and 4 ) . This unique behavior was further validated in Figs . S4 and S8 , where the overdamped Langevin dynamics simulations of the same system pro - duced the MSD without the bounce - back oscillations . In our study , we adopted the AOUP model for the active tracer . As described in Introduction , there exist other rel - evant active particle models , including the active Brown - ian particle ( ABP ) model [ 70 ] or the run - and - tumble par - ticle model [ 10 ] . In these models , the active force is con - sistently characterized by an exponentially decaying direc - tional memory [ 71 , 72 ] , but their microscopic mechanism is distinct : The ABP moves with a constant propulsion speed while its orientation randomly changes . The run - and - tumble particle follows straight paths with intermittent tumbling events , reflecting a distinct succession of straight - line segments . It remains an open question to systemati - cally examine how the active diffusion in a polymer network depends on these active tracer models . To obtain an insight into the dependence of active tracer models on the active diffusion reported in Sec . III , we re - peated the underdamped Langevin dynamics simulations of our semi - flexible polymer networks with the ABP model . For a direct comparison with our AOUP model , we ne - glected the rotational inertia and set the rotational diffusiv - ity to D R = 1 / ( 2 τ A ) , which yields the same propulsion mem - ory and MSDs of the AOUP described in Eqs . ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , re - 10 10 −1 10 0 10 1 10 2 ⟨ Δ r 2 r e l ( t ) ⟩ ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) ( e ) ( f ) ( g ) ( h ) ( i ) ABP AOUP κ = 0 κ = 20 k B T κ = 60 k B T κ = 100 k B T 10 −1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 ⟨ Δ r 2 r e l ( t ) ⟩ ABP AOUP κ = 0 κ = 60 k B T κ = 100 k B T 10 0 10 2 10 4 10 6 ⟨ Δ r 2 r e l ( t ) ⟩ ABP AOUP κ = 0 κ = 100 k B T 10 −1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 t 0 . 0 2 . 5 5 . 0 N G P ( t ) ABP AOUP κ = 0 κ = 20 k B T κ = 60 k B T κ = 100 k B T 10 −1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 t 0 10 20 N G P ( t ) Pe = 18 Pe = 72 Pe = 7 10 −1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 t 0 2 4 N G P ( t ) 0 20 40 60 80 100 κ ∕ k B T 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 ⟨ τ ⟩ ABP AOUP Pe = 0 Pe = 7 Pe = 18 Pe = 36 Pe = 54 Pe = 72 0 20 40 60 80 100 κ ∕ k B T 10 2 10 3 ⟨ l 2 ⟩ 0 20 40 60 80 100 κ ∕ k B T 10 −4 10 −3 10 −2 10 −1 10 0 10 1 D L FIG . 6 .

In Fig . 6a , we compare the MSDs of ABPs and AOUPs at Pe = 7 . When Pe is relatively small compared to the poten - tial barrier to escape from the trapping , the effect of self - propulsive movement is negligible and the MSDs for both ABP and AOUP tracers are almost identical . However , as the activeness is increased to Pe = 18 ( Fig . 6b ) , we can ob - serve the difference between the two models . Here , the mi - croscopic features of each model play a distinct role in the MSDs . While the MSDs of the two models coincide in the short - time regime where the tracer rarely interacts with the polymer network , the AOUPs in the intermediate - to - long - time regimes consistently display larger MSDs compared to ABPs . This indicates that AOUPs have a greater propensity to escape from trapping than ABPs . Notably , when the ac - tiveness is further increased to Pe = 72 ( Fig . 6c ) , the MSDs of both models converge , reflecting a scenario where trapping occurrences are rare , and ABPs and AOUPs explore the net - work with a similar self - propulsion tendency . In Figs . 6d – f , we analyze the NGPs . Consistent with the MSDs , non - Gaussianity of the active movement is alike for both models at Pe = 7 while the AOUP exhibits stronger non - Gaussian diffusion than the ABP at high Pe numbers . In Fig . 6g , we investigate the mean trapped times ( 〈 τ 〉 ) for both models . The 〈 τ 〉 is similar to each other at Pe = 7 . For intermedi - ate Pe values , the AOUP has a shorter mean trapped time than the ABP . When Pe is increased further , the trapping ef - fect is more negligible , resulting in a smaller difference in 〈 τ 〉 between the two models . For all Pe values explored , 〈 τ 〉 of the ABP is shown to increase with κ , mirroring the be - havior observed in the AOUP . Figure 6h shows the mean square flight lengths of ABPs and AOUPs . The 〈 l 2 〉 of AOUPs is larger than that of ABPs at intermediate Pe values , with the disparity becoming less dominant for larger Pe . Finally , Fig . 6i presents the long - time diffusivity of ABPs and AOUPs . Consistent with other observables , the difference between ABPs and AOUPs is noticeable in the regime of intermediate Pe and becomes negligible at small and large Pe values . In a nutschell , ABPs exhibit qualitatively similar trapped - and - hopping active diffusion as AOUPs , as observed in our main study . The distinction in their active diffusion is evident pri - marily in the intermediate Pe regime , where the active es - caping dynamics from a trapped site are largely dominated by the microscopic self - propulsion mechanism inherent to each model . V . CONCULSIONS We have simulated AOUPs in a semi - flexible polymer net - work and systematically investigated the effects of bending stiffness on the trapped - and - hopping active diffusion . We have found that the diffusivity of AOUPs is mainly governed by the particle - to - mesh size ratio and semi - flexibility of the polymer network as well as Pe . When the tracer size is marginally smaller than the mesh size , the polymer’s stiffness does not drastically affect the trapped - and - hopping dynamics . This is because the trap - 11 ping force is negligibly small while hopping frequently oc - curs in the presence of minor obstacle effects from the network . However , when the tracer size is comparable to the mesh size , the stiff polymer network hinders the hop - ping and enhances the trapped time . Consequently , the mean trapped time becomes longer as the polymer be - comes stiffer . However , the flight length is a decreasing function of the bending stiffness only for large Pe , in which the long - jump events are more hindered by the stiff poly - mers . For active tracers marginally larger than the mesh size , we have observed that the tracers suffer confined mo - tions easily when the activeness is weak . When the ac - tiveness increases , the hopping process starts to occur , by which the trapped time depends on the polymer stiffness sensitively while the flight length does not . However , for largely activated tracers , the hopping dynamics becomes dominant and the flight length changes sensitively with varying bending stiffness , while the trapped time becomes less sensitive . Our study , which was extended from the previous work for flexible polymer networks [ 58 ] , demonstrates that the polymer’s semi - flexibility plays an important role in sen - sitively modulating the active diffusion of the mesh - sized tracers confined in the polymer network . The observed trapped - and - hopping mechanism thus provides insights to better understand the active dynamics under confinement .

From every rela - tive particle positions r rel , i ( t ) , we compute the skeletonized trajectories ˆ x ≡ F Bi [ F Bi [ x ] ] , where F Bi is the bilateral fil - ter [ 64 ] and x is a component of the relative trajectory . This is defined as F Bi [ x ] ≡ 1 W p (cid:88) t i ∈ Ω x j ( t i ) f (cid:161)(cid:175)(cid:175) x j ( t i ) − x j ( t k ) (cid:175)(cid:175)(cid:162) g ( | t i − t k | ) , ( 22 ) where W p = (cid:80) x i ∈ Ω f (cid:161)(cid:175)(cid:175) x j ( t i ) − x j ( t k ) (cid:175)(cid:175)(cid:162) g ( | t i − t k | ) is the nor - malization factor , f and g are the Gaussian kernels given by f ( x ) = e − x 2 / σ 2 x and g ( t ) = e − t 2 / σ 2 t . We set σ x = 5 and σ t = 1 . The bilateral filter’s edge - preserving properties produce skeletonized trajectories ˆ x with noise - free trapped parts and instantaneous jumps . Next , we identify hopping events from the filtered trajec - tory ˆ x by examining our criteria | ˆ x ( t + 2 t 0 ) − ˆ x ( t − t 0 ) | > l c , where the cutoff is l c = 0 . 6 × l 0 = 3 . We then determine the initial and final times for the hopping by checking if the original trajectory x ( t ) and filtered trajectory ˆ x share the same direction in one component . Specifically , if four seg - ments x ( t + t 0 ) − x ( t ) , x ( t ) − x ( t − t 0 ) , ˆ x ( t + t 0 ) − ˆ x ( t ) , and ˆ x ( t ) − ˆ x ( t − t 0 ) have the same direction , and the tracer is in a hopping state at t + t 0 or t − t 0 , we set the tracer to be in a hopping state at t . We iteratively apply this condition to establish the initial and final hopping times . Since the trajectory is in 3D , we define a trapped state when the trajectory is not in a hopping state for any compo - nents . The trapped time is then defined as the duration of consecutive trapped states . To determine the flight time , we find the duration of consecutive hopping states . Finally , for the flight length , we calculate the chord length of the hop - ping state in 3D by using two ends of positions of the con - secutive hopping interval . B . Active diffusion of small tracers Figure A1 represents the active diffusion of small tracers ( σ tr = 1 ) in the polymer networks . For the small tracers , the polymer network acts as a trivial obstacle to the trac - ers . Figure A1a is the sample trajectory of small active trac - ers ( Pe = 1 ) . Figure A1b represents the MSDs for small active tracers , where the color represents Pe and the symbols rep - resent the different stiffness κ . The simulation results show that varying the polymer’s bending stiffness does not sig - nificantly affect the diffusion dynamics of small active trac - ers . Figures A1c – e represent the NGPs of small active trac - ers . The NGPs of the small active tracers in a semi - flexible polymer network exhibit only a slight increase compared to those in a flexible polymer network . C . The potential of mean forces for tracers of size σ tr = 5 and 6 For the Brownian tracer ( Pe = 0 ) confined in a polymer mesh , we calculate the potential of mean force by the fol - lowing relations : p ( x ) ∼ e − β U ( x ) U ( x ) = − k B T ln (cid:161) p ( x ) (cid:162) + k B T ln (cid:161) p 0 (cid:162) ( 23 ) Here , for convenience , we set U ( 0 ) = 0 by adding the second term where p 0 ≡ p ( x = 0 ) . Figure A2 depicts the potential of mean force calculated from the trajectories of the Brownian tracers , which shows how the potential of mean force is modulated by the poly - mer’s stiffness . 12 0 200 400 600 800 1000 t −40 −20 0 x ( t ) ∕ l 0 Pe = 1 10 −1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 t 10 −2 10 0 10 2 10 4 10 6 ⟨ Δ r 2 r e l ( t ) ⟩ κ = 0 κ = 50 k B T κ = 100 k B T Pe = 0 Pe = 1 Pe = 5 Pe = 10 10 −1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 N G P ( t ) ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) ( e ) Pe = 0 κ = 0 κ = 50 k B T κ = 100 k B T 10 −1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 t 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 N G P ( t ) Pe = 1 10 −1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 t 0 . 0 0 . 5 N G P ( t ) Pe = 5 FIG .
