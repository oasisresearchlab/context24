Integrin ectodo - mains are composed of an α and β subunit stably joined at the α - and β - head domain , each connected to a flexible leg , which continues to a single transmembrane helix followed by a short cytoplasmic domain ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . Integrins utilize the flexibility of their ectodomains to bidirectionally transduce conformational signals to and from the cell interior 2 . In current models of integrin function , regulation of ligand affinity and signaling is thought to be mediated by a series of coupled motions of the ligand - binding headpiece with leg domains , changing the overall shape from a bent to an extended con - formation : the so called ‘switchblade’ model ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) 3 . Despite extensive studies , the mechanistic structural details of integrin extension remain elusive . The opposing model proposes that integrins can regulate ligand affinity and transduce signaling entirely in a bent conformation ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) 4 . Furthermore , it is not known how integrins probe the extracellular milieu to find target - binding motifs in extracellular matrix proteins , cytokines and growth factors , a function not elucidated by either model . Three main conformational states are currently proposed : bent integrins with a closed headpiece and extended integrins with either a closed or open headpiece ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Crystal structures of integrin ectodomains reveal exclusively bent confor - mations ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Negative - stain electron micros - copy ( ns - EM ) images of numerous integrin heterodimers exhibit all three conformational states , with ligand occupancy favoring the extended - open conformation ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . These stud - ies mainly support the prevailing hypothesis that the high - affinity state has an extended - open conformation 5 . For the α v β 8 integrin , only the extended - closed form has been observed by ns - EM , either alone or in association with ligand 6 , 7 . Those findings are inconsistent with both the bent and the switch - blade models and suggest that the α v β 8 integrin functions entirely in the extended - closed form ( Supplementary Fig . 1d ) . The rela - tive conformational homogeneity of α v β 8 makes it an ideal target for structural studies of an integrin in the extended conformation . Here we present single - particle electron cryomicroscopy ( cryo - EM ) structures of the α v β 8 integrin in complex with two immunoglobu - lin antigen - binding fragments ( Fab ) to reveal an integrin in a range of extended conformations with unprecedented clarity . We achieve an overall resolution of 6 . 4 Å , with a resolution of 4 . 8 Å in the headpiece . The motion between the headpiece and the leg suggests a mechanism by which integrin headpieces survey extracellular surfaces for ligands . Our structures predict the interactions between α v thigh and calf - 1 domains in this extended conformation , which is confirmed with rationally designed α v β 3 mutants . Results Cryo - EM structures of the α v β 8 integrin . Integrins in an extended conformation have not been crystallized . Current single - particle EM structures do not have sufficient detail to provide insights into integrin extension or surveillance mechanisms ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Even with the recent advances in single particle cryo - EM 8 , determining high - resolution integrin structures remains challeng - ing . The main technical barriers are the low mass density , asym - metry and extreme conformational flexibility , all of which conspire to hinder accurate image alignment and conformational classifica - tion 9 . To mitigate these challenges , we use two different monoclonal Fabs ( 8B8 and 68 ) directed at the headpiece of the α v β 8 integrin to increase the molecular mass and facilitate more accurate image alignment 10 . Neither Fab alters α v β 8 function , with 8B8 directed at the α v head and 68 at the β 8 β I - domain 6 . With this combination of Fabs , we determined the structure of the α v β 8 - 8B8 - 68 complex , in which the integrin is in the extended - closed conformation , to Cryo - EM structure of the α v β 8 integrin reveals a mechanism for stabilizing integrin extension Anthony Cormier 1 , 7 , Melody G .

Nishimura 1 * and Yifan Cheng 2 , 3 * Integrins are conformationally flexible cell surface receptors that survey the extracellular environment for their cognate ligands . Interactions with ligands are thought to be linked to global structural rearrangements involving transitions between bent , extended - closed and extended - open forms . Thus far , structural details are lacking for integrins in the extended conforma - tions due to extensive flexibility between the headpiece and legs in this conformation . Here we present single - particle electron cryomicroscopy structures of human α v β 8 integrin in the extended - closed conformation , which has been considered to be a low - affinity intermediate . Our structures show the headpiece rotating about a flexible α v knee , suggesting a ligand surveillance mechanism for integrins in their extended - closed form . Our model predicts that the extended conformation is mainly stabilized by an interface formed between flexible loops in the upper and lower domains of the α v leg . Confirming these findings with the α v β 3 integrin suggests that our model of stabilizing the extended - closed conformation is generalizable to other integrins . NAtuRE StRuCtuRAL & MoLECuLAR BIoLoGY | www . nature . com / nsmb Articles NaTure STruCTural & MOleCular BIOlOgy an overall resolution of 6 . 4 Å ( Fig . 1a , Table 1 and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . An atomic model of the α v β 8 integrin in the extended con - formation was obtained by fitting homology models of individual domains ( based on available crystal structures of integrin α v β 3 ) into the cryo - EM density map . Subsequently , the model was iteratively rebuilt and refined into the density using Phenix 11 and Rosetta 12 ( Fig . 1b ) . At this resolution , the boundaries for all the individual domains in the α v leg and β 8 headpiece are clearly defined , with well - resolved secondary structural features including all α - helices and many β - sheets ( Fig . 1a , b ) . The inherent conformational flexibilities of integrin leg domains relative to the headpiece and the flexibility of the Fab constant rel - ative to the variable domains ( which together account for ~ 42 % of the total mass of the complex ) compromise the accuracy of image alignment and limit the overall resolution . By masking out the leg and the constant domains of the Fabs , we improve the resolu - tion of the headpiece to 4 . 8 Å ( Fig . 1c , Table 1 and Supplementary Fig . 2c , f ) . At this improved resolution , densities of some bulky side chains and glycans of all predicted N - linked glycosylation sites in the headpiece are clearly resolved , serving as excellent landmarks for model building and validation ( Fig . 1d , e and Supplementary Table 2 ) . Head domain motions : the sunflower model . When image align - ment is focused on the headpiece , the leg densities become very weak , indicating the relative flexibility between the head and legs . 3D classification reveals six conformational snapshots , each at sub - nanometer resolution , with improved leg density ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . To approximate the motion of a membrane - anchored inte - grin , we aligned the α v lower legs of each subclass with each other , revealing different angular positions of the α v β 8 headpiece as it tilts relative to the leg domains ( Fig . 2a – c ) . Individual subclasses reveal complex twisting and angular motions of the headpiece that are associated with varying degrees of contact between the β 8 upper and lower legs with the α v leg . The range of motion of the headpiece is approximately 30° as estimated from the differences between subclasses ( i ) and ( v ) ( Fig . 2a – c ) . The intrinsic motion of the headpiece of an integrin joined to flexible legs anchored on the plasma membrane would facili - tate surveillance of the extracellular space for ligand detection . The overall effect is that the α v β 8 head samples an elliptical conic space similar to a sunflower’s as the sunflower moves during the day ( Supplementary Video 1 ) . Our data provide structural insight into how a single integrin samples a large space , and this motion is presumably beneficial for ligand detection . Loss of β 8 leg contacts with the α v leg favors full receptor exten - sion . The changes in β 8 leg density in the six subclasses suggest a role for the β 8 leg in the sunflower motion . In subclass ( i ) , the β 8 leg density is apparent as a continuous density between the β 8 upper leg that contacts the α v thigh domain and then continues along the α v lower leg ( Fig . 2b ) . The α v β 8 headpiece movement through subclasses ( ii ) – ( vi ) involves loosening of the contacts that the β 8 upper leg makes with the α v thigh and α v calf - 1 domains in sub - class ( i ) ( Fig . 2a – c ) . Likewise , the β 8 lower leg density is strongest in subclass ( i ) and is weaker in subclasses ( ii ) – ( vi ) , suggesting that the β 8 leg loses contact with the α v leg as α v β 8 maximally extends ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . The resolution of the density map does not permit modeling of the individual domains of the β 8 leg . However , the density map of subclass ( i ) allows placement of the β 8 PSI - EGF1 domain , which forms the lower portion of the upper β - subunit leg in the integrin headpiece and ectodomain crystal structures , in contact with the C - terminal α v thigh domain ( Fig . 2d ) .

NAtuRE StRuCtuRAL & MoLECuLAR BIoLoGY | www . nature . com / nsmb Articles NaTure STruCTural & MOleCular BIOlOgy domain with the α v subunit is not observed in subclasses ( iii ) – ( vi ) ( Fig . 2e ) . Overall , these data suggest that domain contacts between the α v and β 8 legs are not required to maintain the extended con - formation . Following this result , we further hypothesize that in all α v inte - grins the α v leg alone is sufficient to maintain an extended confor - mation . To test the role of β - leg in integrin extension , we generate a mutant α v β 3 integrin ectodomain truncated at the β 3 EGF2 domain ( Fig . 3 ) . If the β 3 lower leg is required for extension , the truncation mutant would be predicted to destabilize extension and favor bend - ing . However , ns - EM demonstrates that the lower - leg β 3 deletion mutant has a slight decrease in bent forms compared with the wild - type α v β 3 integrin ectodomain , suggesting that the β - lower leg does not directly contribute to extension of the α v leg ( Fig . 3a – f ) . The α v hinge . Comparison of the overall and subclassified cryo - EM density maps confirms that the entire lower α v leg is more or less a rigid body , with the main point of motion occurring between the lower α v thigh domain of the upper α v leg and the calf - 1 domain of the α v lower leg ( Fig . 2a – c ) . In our model the α v thigh domain interfaces extensively with the α v calf - 1 domain through interac - tions between a loop in the α v thigh domain and three loops in the calf - 1 domain ( Fig . 4a ) . These loops are not in contact in the crystal structure of α v β 3 in the bent conformation 13 . Also , a loop between the C - terminal thigh and N - terminal calf - 1 domain designated as the knee region in α v β 3 crystal structures does not participate in the α v thigh – calf - 1 interface in the extended conformation ( Fig . 2d , e ) . These two observations suggest a rearrangement of domains from bent to extended conformations so that new interactions are formed to stabilize the extended conformation . Sequence alignment of the PS2 subfamily of integrin α - subunits shows that these predicted interacting loops are highly conserved ( Fig . 4b ) . To validate our pre - diction and to generalize our model to other α v integrins , we intro - duced two cysteine residues ( S546C and N685C ) into two opposing loops of the α v integrin subunit , one in the thigh loop and the other in loop 2 of the calf - 1 domain ( Figs . 3g and 4a ) ; this henceforth is referred to as the α vc - c mutant . When paired with either the β 8 or β 3 subunits , it forms two different functional integrin heterodimers . If our model of the extended α v leg is correct , a disulfide bond will form between these two cysteine residues and lock the α v leg into an extended conformation . Consequently , when expressed on the cell surface , α vc - c would be predicted to enhance the function of integrin α v β 3 by relieving steric hindrance , but not the function of α v β 8 , which is already extended . Ns - EM of the mutant α vc - c β 3 ectodomain revealed only extended but no bent integrins ( Fig . 3g – i ) . In comparison , ns - EM of the wild - type α v β 3 integrin ectodomain showed all forms ( Fig . 3a – c ) . To confirm our findings in vivo , we expressed the full - length mutant and wild - type human α v β 3 integrins on the cell surface of Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells . These cells were sorted to have uni - form and equal expression of the mutant and wild - type α v , in addi - tion to β 3 subunits ( Fig . 5a ) . The α vc - c β 3 integrin had increased basal exposure of ligand - induced - binding - site ( LIBS ) epitopes consistent with a constitutively extended conformation ( Fig . 5a ) . Furthermore , the α vc - c β 3 integrin displayed increased ability to mediate cell adhesion to its ligand , vitronectin , than the wild - type α v β 3 , in both basal and activating cation conditions ( Fig . 5b ) . As expected , the α vc - c β 8 mutant and wild - type human α v β 8 integrins expressed on CHO cells bound equally to its ligand , latent TGF - β ( Fig . 5c ) , and showed no preferential binding under the activating cation conditions , consistent with previous studies 6 . The increased ability of the α vc - c β 3 integrin to mediate cell adhesion is not due to increased binding affinity , since the mutant and wild - type integrin ectodomains bind equally to their ligands in both basal and activat - ing cation conditions ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . Discussion The integrin α v β 8 is functionally specialized to bind latent forms of the multifunctional cytokines TGF - β 1 and TGF - β 3 ( L - TGF - β ) 14 , 15 . The majority of L - TGF - β is not freely diffusible but covalently attached to extracellular matrix or to the cell surface via L - TGF - β binding proteins ( for example , LTBP - 1 ) or cell - surface scaffold - ing proteins ( for example , GARP ) 16 , 17 . Binding of α v β 8 to cell - or matrix - expressed L - TGF - β results in the release of active TGF - β , a process essential for the homeostatic and pathologic functions of TGF - β in vivo 18 . The α v β 8 integrin may have evolved , among the five integrins that share the α v subunit , to bias its conformational range toward the extended - closed form to increase the chance of encountering L - TGF - β expressed on an opposing cell or matrix . Despite pairing with the same α v subunit , α v β 3 can bend while α v β 8 does not , indicating that the β - subunit influences integrin conformational dynamics . Our cryo - EM data suggest that contacts between the α v and β 8 lower legs are critical in the tilting of the Table 1 | Cryo - EM data collection , refinement and validation statistics Integrin α v β 8 headpiece ( EMD - 7939 , PDB 6DJP ) Data collection and processing Magnification 41 , 132 Voltage ( kV ) 300 Electron exposure ( e – / Å 2 ) 41 Defocus range ( μ m ) 1 . 8 – 2 . 8 Pixel size ( Å ) 1 . 67 Symmetry imposed None Initial particle images ( no . ) 144 , 005 Final particle images ( no . ) 17 , 442 Map resolution ( Å ) 4 . 8 FSC threshold 0 . 143 Map resolution range ( Å ) 4 . 8 – 6 . 4 Refinement Initial model used PDB 3IJE Model resolution ( Å ) 4 . 8 FSC threshold 0 . 143 Model resolution range ( Å ) n / a Map sharpening B factor ( Å 2 ) – 144 Model composition Nonhydrogen atoms 7 , 307 Protein residues 1 , 416 B factors ( Å 2 ) 137 R . m . s . deviations Bond lengths ( Å ) 0 . 50 Bond angles ( ° ) 0 . 79 Validation MolProbity score 0 . 95 Clashscore 0 . 36 Poor rotamers ( % ) 0 Ramachandran plot Favored ( % ) 95 . 36 Allowed ( % ) 100 Disallowed ( % ) 0 n / a , not applicable .

As such , the tilting of the α v β 8 headpiece may represent an analog of the bent form of α v β 3 , the differences in the magnitude of bending driven by differences within the β 8 lower leg . Experimental mutagenesis or naturally occurring disease - causing mutations in the β 3 lower leg cause con - stitutive activation and exposure of LIBS epitopes , indicating that such mutations cause extension of the α iib β 3 integrin 19 , 20 . These β 3 mutations often occur in conserved cysteines , which form disulfide loops and are critical determinates of the EGF domain structure of the β 3 lower leg 20 . The β 8 lower leg lacks two of these conserved disulfide pairs in the EGF3 and β - tail domains ( Supplementary Fig . 5c ) . One possibility is that the β 8 lower leg has lost its ability to stabilize the bent conformation , which raises the hypothesis that other integrin β - subunit lower legs stabilize the bent conforma - tion . An alternate hypothesis has been proposed that the β - lower leg contributes to extension via a disulfide loop of EGF2 at the junction between the upper and lower legs of integrin β - subunits , which acts as an entropic spring shifting the conformational equi - librium toward extension 21 . To test these hypotheses , we remove the lower leg of the β 3 subunit containing the entropic spring and found that the conformational ensemble of the α v β 3 truncation mutant was somewhat biased toward the extended - open con - formation . This result favors the hypothesis that the β lower leg stabilizes the bent conformation . Our model of the extended α v leg predicts that two loops between the α v thigh and α v calf - 1 domain contribute to stabilizing the extended conformation . We validated this model and suggest that the extended conformation for a α - integrin subunit is stable with - out contribution from the β lower leg . Furthermore , our data sug - gest that the β - leg does not cause the extended conformation . On the basis of our data , we hypothesize that the transition from the bent to extended closed conformation requires disrupting or weakening α – β lower leg interactions , which releases the integrin to the extended conformation . Sequence comparison suggests that this model of integrin extension could apply at the very least to the closely related integrin α - subunits α iib , α 5 and α 8 , which are strikingly homologous in the interacting loops of the α - thigh and α - calf - 1 domains . α v β 8 assumes only the extended - closed conformation , yet efficiently binds to and activates L - TGF - β , indicating that the extended - closed conformation of α v β 8 is functional . Here we gen - eralize this finding to the α v β 3 integrin by providing evidence that the extended - closed form of α v β 3 is also functional . This conclu - sion is based on the fact that when expressed on the cell surface the α vc - c β 3 mutant exhibits higher basal adhesion than wild - type α v β 3 , while the soluble α vc - c β 3 and wild - type α v β 3 ectodomains exhibit identical basal ligand binding .

These findings raise the possibility that the extended - closed conformation of other integrins is biologically important . In summary , cryo - EM is an advantageous method for determin - ing multiple snapshots at subnanometer resolution of integrins across their dynamic conformational range . Characterizing the motion of α v β 8 has provided insights into the integrin extension mechanism and has provided a model for ligand surveillance , which we found to also be applicable to α v β 3 . These data suggest that this mechanism for stabilizing integrin extension could be generalizable to other integrins .

NAtuRE StRuCtuRAL & MoLECuLAR BIoLoGY | www . nature . com / nsmb Articles NaTure STruCTural & MOleCular BIOlOgy Methods Cell lines and reagents . The antibodies 8B8 , 68 , AP3 , AP5 , LIBS1 and LIBS6 have been previously described 6 , 22 , 23 . Human embryonic kidney 293 ( HEK293 ) cells were obtained from the American Tissue Type Collection ( ATCC , Manassas , VA ) . CHOLec 3 . 2 . 8 . 1 cells were provided by Pamela Stanley ( Albert Einstein College of Medicine ) 24 . Truncated recombinant human vitronectin N - terminal fragment ( VTN - N ) was purchased from Thermo Fisher scientific ( Waltham , MA ) . Cell culture media and antibiotics were prepared by the University of California , San Francisco Cell Culture Facility using deionized water and analytical grade reagents . Fetal calf serum was obtained from Invitrogen ( Carlsbad , CA ) . The CHOLec 3 . 2 . 8 . 1 cell line was functionally verified by production of hypoglycosylated recombinant protein by SDS – PAGE . The cell line was tested for mycoplasma contamination and was negative . Protein expression and purification . Wild - type and mutant recombinant human integrin α v β 8 and α v β 3 truncated at the junction of the ectodomains and transmembrane domains in pcDNA1neo 25 were expressed using stably expressing CHOLec 3 . 2 . 8 . 1 cells grown in bioreactors ( for structural studies ) or transiently transfected HEK293 cells ( for biochemical characterization ) . Purification was carried out by affinity chromatography using a protein G – 8B8 column followed by size exclusion chromatography ( Superdex 200 Increase 10 / 300 GL , GE Healthcare ) in 20 mM Tris HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM CaCl 2 and 1 mM MgCl 2 . Antibodies were purified as described previously 6 . 8B8 and 68 fragments were generated by papain digestion ( Pierce ) of the IgG followed by protein A – agarose ( Millipore ) incubation to remove Fc fragments and intact antibodies . The homogeneity and purity of all protein preparations were verified by SDS – PAGE stained with Coomassie blue , and protein concentrations were measured by micro - bicinchoninic acid assay ( Pierce ) . To prepare integrin – Fab complexes , 100 μ g of recombinant α v β 8 was incubated in a twofold molar excess of each Fab , incubated at room temperature for 30 min , subjected to size exclusion chromatography and concentrated to 6 to 9 mg / ml . Porcine L - TGF - β was expressed and purified as described 26 . ns - EM sample preparation , data acquisition and analysis . Grids of negatively stained integrin samples were prepared following established protocols 27 . Specifically , 2 . 5 μ l of purified truncated α v β 3 , α v β 3HP or α vc - c β 3 sample with a concentration of ~ 0 . 02 mg / ml were applied to glow - discharged carbon - coated copper grids , washed , stained with 0 . 75 % ( w / v ) uranyl formate and aspirated to dryness 6 . Negatively stained grids were imaged on a Tecnai T12 electron microscope ( FEI Company ) equipped with a LaB 6 filament and operating at a 120 kV acceleration voltage . Images were recorded at a nominal magnification of 52 , 000 × and a defocus of – 1 . 5 μ m using a 4 K CCD camera ( UltraScan 4000 , Gatan , Inc . , Pleasanton , CA ) , with a corresponding pixel size of 2 . 21 Å on the specimen . Images were 2 × 2 binned for particle picking and further processing . Particles were picked using reference - free methods as implemented in Gautomatch ( http : / / www . mrc - lmb . cam . ac . uk / kzhang / Gautomatch ) and further processed using the Relion pipeline 28 . Cryo - EM sample preparation , data acquisition and analysis . For cryo - EM grid preparation , 3 μ l of purified α v β 8 - 8B8 - 68 complex ( 6 . 8 mg / ml concentration ) were applied to Quantifoil grids ( holey carbon film with 1 . 2 μ m hole size and 1 . 3 μ m hole spacing on 400 - mesh copper grid ) , glow - discharged for 60 s at 15 mA , blotted with a Vitrobot Mark III ( FEI Company ) using 3 . 5 – 4 . 5 s blotting time with 100 % humidity at 20 °C , and plunge - frozen in liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen . Cryo - EM images of frozen hydrated α v β 8 - 8B8 - 68 complexes were collected on a TF30 Polara electron microscope ( FEI Company ) equipped with a field emission electron source and operated at 300 kV . Images were recorded at a nominal magnification of 31 , 000 × using a K2 Summit direct electron detector camera ( Gatan ) operated in super - resolution mode following an established protocol 29 . The microscope settings were as follows : extraction voltage 4 , 200 eV , gun lens 1 , spotsize 3 , a 30 μ m C2 aperture and a 100 μ m objective aperture . Data were manually collected using UCSFImage4 30 or SerialEM 31 , using a nominal defocus range of – 1 . 8 to – 2 . 8 µ m . The calibrated physical pixel size was 1 . 22 Å at specimen and a dose rate of 10 . 12 e – / pixel . A total dose of 41 e – / Å 2 was fractionated over 30 frames during the 6 - s exposures . From the cryo - EM images , particles do not have preferred orientation in vitreous ice , but they are found only in thick ice and sparsely distributed . A total of 2 , 174 movies were collected over three sessions ; however , only 713 movies ( collected during a single session ) were used for the final map . Dose - fractionated super - resolution image stacks were motion corrected and binned 2 × 2 by Fourier cropping using MotionCor2 32 . Motion - corrected sums without dose weighting were used for contrast transfer function ( CTF ) determination using GCTF 33 . The relatively low signal - to - noise ratio in Fourier power spectra , due to sparsely distributed particles in thick ice , limits the accuracy of CTF estimation . 144 , 005 particles were picked using the reference - free method in Gautomatch , boxed out in Relion 2 . 0 with a box size of 320 pixels and binned to 64 pixels . Upon micrograph inspection , we noted that many of these picks were ‘false positives’ and did not represent particles but rather ice or debris . This is likely due to the reference - free picking approach . After two rounds of 2D alignment and classification in Relion 2 . 0 28 , particles were re - extracted and binned to 128 pixels to generate ab initio initial models using CryoSPARC 34 . After 3D alignment and classification in Relion 2 . 0 to further sort ideal particles from junk , this new smaller subset of particles ( 17 , 442 ) was re - extracted using dose - weighted micrographs and binned to a final box size of 256 pixels ( 1 . 67 Å / pixel ) . Using one of the models generated during 3D classification low - pass filtered to 20 Å as an initial model , initial angles and shifts were determined in Relion 2 . 0 . Frealign 9 35 in mode 1 was used for subsequent refinement and reconstruction . During the refinement , only data up to a resolution of 8 Å were used to avoid possible overfitting and bias in the FSC curves at higher resolution . For the α v β 8 - 8B8 - 68 complex , the resolution of the overall map was estimated to be 6 . 4 Å . Subsequently , a soft mask was generated to exclude the constant domains of both Fabs as well as calf - 1 and calf - 2 of the α - subunit and the PSI - EGF1 domains of the β - subunit . This improved the resolution of the α v β 8 - 8B8 - 68 complex to 4 . 8 Å ( resolution limited to 6 Å in Frealign ) . We speculate that the accuracy of CTF estimation and thick ice are contributing factors that limit the resolution . For the six complexes showing leg motion , the processing schematic is described in Supplementary Fig . 3 and the resolution during refinement was limited to 10 Å in all cases . Resolutions were determined using FSC = 0 . 143 criterion 36 . All postprocessing , including mask generation , filtering , sharpening and masked FSC estimation , were done using Relion 2 . 0 . Local resolution was estimated in Bsoft blocres 37 . Map to model FSC was calculated in Rosetta . Images were rendered in UCSF Chimera 38 and Pymol 39 ; the movie was rendered in UCSF Chimera . Model building and refinement . The atomic model of the α v headpiece from the crystal structure of α v β 3 ( PDB : 3IJE ) with glycans removed was fitted to the cryo - EM density of α v β 8 - 8B8 - 68 complex as a rigid body . An atomic model of the β 8 headpiece was generated by rigid - body fitting of a homology model based on the same crystal structure ( 3IJE ) using Modeller 40 into the cryo - EM map . Atomic models of Fabs were generated with Rosetta Antibody using multiple - template grafting and H3 loop modelization 12 based on the primary sequence of their V h and V k . The models for Fab 68 and Fab 8B8 were then fitted as a rigid body to the map . Prototypical CHOLec glycans were added back to the model at the solvent - exposed N - glycosylation consensus sites using GLYCAM 41 . The sugar bases of glycans were trimmed to fit into the corresponding densities . After rigid body fitting , models were manually adjusted in COOT 42 , followed by real space refinement using Phenix 11 and Rosetta . Integrin mutants constructs . To construct the truncated human α vc - c mutant , we used splice overlap extension PCR . Mutagenesis primers are included in Supplementary Table 3 . The resulting amplicon was cut with PstI and SphI and ligated into α v truncated pcDM8 cut with the same enzymes 43 . To make the full - length α vc - c mutant , truncated α vc - c pcDM8 was cut with BstEII and SphI and ligated into α v full - length pcDM8 cut with the same enzymes . The human β 3 HP mutant was amplified using primers listed in Supplementary Table 3 followed by cutting with BamHI and XhoI and ligation into human truncated β 3 pcDNA1neo cut with the same enzymes 44 . All constructs were verified by sequencing . Ligand binding , cell adhesion assays and cell staining . For ligand binding assays , ELISA plates were coated with 0 . 5 µ g / ml of L - TGF - β ( for α v β 8 wild - type and α vc - c β 8 ) or vitronectin - N ( for α v β 3 wild - type and α vc - c β 3 ) and blocked with 5 % BSA in PBS for 1 h ; truncated integrin was allowed to bind for 2 h at room temperature and bound integrin was detected with 8B8 – biotin and streptavidin – HRP . For cell adhesion assays , ELISA plates were coated with various concentrations of vitronectin - N or L - TGF - β and blocked using PBS with 5 % BSA for 1 h , and then 50 , 000 α v β 3 , α v β 8 α vc - c β 3 or α vc - c β 8 CHOLec 3 . 2 . 8 . 1 cells were allowed to adhere to wells for 30 min at room temperature in the presence of 1 mM Ca 2 + and 1 mM Mg 2 + or 0 . 2 mM Mn 2 + . Cell staining and flow cytometry was performed as previously described 6 . Sequence alignments . Multiple protein sequence alignments for integrins were generated using Tcoffee 45 . Statistics . ELISA data are reported as means ± s . e . m . All statistical analyses were performed using the software package Prism 4 . 0b ( GraphPad Software , San Diego , CA ) . Reporting Summary .
