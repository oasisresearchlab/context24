The pooled estimate was generated using Mean incubation period across the studies was 6 . 38 days , 95 % CI ( 5 . 79 ; 6 . 97 ) . individual mean and SD Alene et al . , 2021 4 Onset of symptoms , incubation period Data on 1 , 453 COVID - 19 patients from 14 different studies were used to estimate mean incubation period Mean incubation period of was 6 . 5 ( 95 % CI : 5 . 9 – 7 . 1 ) days Xin et al . , 2021 5 72 studies published between 11 January 2020 and 13 April 2020 were reviewed and analysed Mean incubation period 6 . 3 days ( range , 1 . 8 - 11 . 9 days ) , median incubation period 5 . 4 days ( range , 2 . 0 - 17 . 9 days ) Néant et al . , 2021 6 RNA VLs RNA VLs were assessed as Ct values from nasopharyngeal swabs collected from 655 hospitalized patients and dynamics of viral loads were visualized using target cell - limited model RNA VLs were detected for 13 dpos in younger patients and 16 dpos in older patients ( ≥65 years old ) . Peak RNA VLs were predicted to coincide with symptom onset Wölfel et al . , 2020 7 Infectious VLs Virological kinetics was analysed in specimens collected from 9 hospitalised patients IV was isolated up to 9 dpos in URT specimens Bullard et al . , 2020 8 Kinetics of infectious and RNA VLs Ct values for SARS - CoV - 2 and IV isolation probability were determined from 90 patients at 0 up to 21 dpos . No IV was recovered after 8 dpos . RNA VLs were detected for more than 10 dpos Jefferson et al . , 2020 9 Kinetics of infectious VLs 29 studies which attempted to culture IV from SARS - CoV - 2 positive specimens were included Despite the detection of RNA VLs for > 14 dpos , the possibility to isolate IV declined after 8 dpos Cevik et al . , 2021 10 Kinetics of RNA VLs 43 studies ( including 3229 individuals ) were included for systemic review and meta - analysis reported duration of Mean duration of viral RNA detection was 17 days ( 95 % CI 15·5 – 18·6 ) ; highest VLs were reported shortly Figure 3 .

Influence of vaccination on VLs ( Delta VOC used as an example ) Study Parameter measured How the study was conducted Findings Singanayagam et al . , 2021 20 Infectious and RNA VLs VLs were compared between fully vaccinated individuals ( n = 29 ) and unvaccinated subjects ( n = 16 ) infected with Delta VOC . Most of the patients received either BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine or ChAdOx1 nCoV - 19 adenovirus vector vaccine Same peak RNA VLs in vaccinated and unvaccinated Delta - infected patients , but faster clearance of RNA VLs Puhach et al . , 2022 16 Infectious and RNA VLs Infectious ( measured by FFA ) and RNA VLs were compared between fully vaccinated ( n = 104 ) and unvaccinated ( n = 127 ) patients infected with Delta VOC . Most of the vaccinated patients received mRNA vaccines ( 95 . 2 % ) . Similar RNA VLs at 5 dpos , but higher infectious VLs in unvaccinated in comparison to unvaccinated individuals Chia et al . , 2021 21 RNA VLs RNA VL kinetics was compared between vaccinated ( n = 88 ) and unvaccinated ( n = 130 ) patients . Most of the patients received 2 doses of mRNA vaccines ( 95 . 5 % ) . RNA VLs were similar between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients at first 5 dpos , but VLs decreased faster in vaccinated patients Peña - Hernández et al . , 2022 22 Infectious VLs IV presence was determined by isolation from samples collected from 72 vaccinated and 53 unvaccinated individuals infected in the time period in which Delta was the predominantly circulating VOC The proportion of samples with culturable virus was lower in vaccinated in comparison to unvaccinated patients ( 21 % vs . 40 % respectively ) References 1 .
