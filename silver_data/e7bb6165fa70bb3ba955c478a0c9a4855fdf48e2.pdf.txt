Type I myosins are highly conserved actin - based molecular motors that localize to the actin - rich cortex and participate in motility functions such as en - docytosis , polarized morphogenesis , and cell migration . The COOH - terminal tail of yeast myosin - I proteins , Myo3p and Myo5p , contains an Src homology domain 3 ( SH3 ) followed by an acidic domain . The myosin - I SH3 domain interacted with both Bee1p and Vrp1p , yeast homologues of human WASP and WIP , adapter pro - teins that link actin assembly and signaling molecules . The myosin - I acidic domain interacted with Arp2 / 3 complex subunits , Arc40p and Arc19p , and showed both sequence similarity and genetic redundancy with the COOH - terminal acidic domain of Bee1p ( Las17p ) , which controls Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin nucle - ation . These ﬁndings suggest that myosin - I proteins may participate in a diverse set of motility functions through a role in actin assembly . Key words : yeast • myosin - I • Arp2 / 3 • actin assem - bly • WASP Introduction Cortical actin polymerization underlies cell movement , polarization , morphogenesis , and cytokinesis ( Drubin and Nelson , 1996 ; Mitchison and Cramer , 1996 ) . Temporal and spatial coordination of these events depends upon adapter proteins , such as members of the WASP ( Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ) , Enabled , and Formin families , which localize to the cell surface and link signaling pathways to actin assembly proteins ( Gertler et al . , 1996 ; Symons et al . , 1996 ; Frazier and Field , 1997 ; Wasserman , 1998 ; Ramesh et al . , 1999 ; Bi and Zigmond , 1999 ; Machesky and Insall , 1999 ) . The dynamic nature of actin polymerization makes it likely that actin assembly machinery associates with ac - tin - based molecular motors . Type I unconventional myo - sins are attractive candidates for motors involved in actin assembly due to their high conservation and participation in a variety of cortical motility processes ( Baines et al . , 1992 ; Wagner et al . , 1992 ; McGoldrick et al . , 1995 ; Novak et al . , 1995 ; Jung et al . , 1996 ; Titus , 1998 ; Mermall et al . , 1998 ) , however their roles at a molecular level have re - mained uncertain . Here we establish that budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae type I myosins functionally asso - ciate with both Bee1p ( Las17p ) , a WASP - like adapter pro - tein , and with components of the Arp2 / 3 actin nucleation complex , suggesting myosin - I proteins participate in the assembly of cortical actin filaments . Yeast Bee1p ( Winter et al . , 1999a ) and other members of the WASP family ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ; Egile et al . , 1999 ; Machesky et al . , 1999 ; Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ; Suetsugu et al . , 1999 ) bind and activate the Arp2 / 3 complex . This complex appears to be a critical component of the actin cy - toskeleton in all eukaryotes . It consists of seven proteins including two actin - related proteins , Arp2p and Arp3p , and localizes to sites of dynamic filamentous actin such as the leading edges of locomoting cells , the actin comet tails of the intracellular pathogen , Listeria monocytogenes , and motile cortical actin patches in yeast ( McCollum et al . , 1996 ; Moreau et al . , 1996 , 1997 ; Mullins et al . , 1997 ; Welch et al . , 1997 , 1998 ; Winter et al . , 1997 , 1999b ; Beckerle , 1998 ; Machesky , 1999 ; Weiner et al . , 1999 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex nucleates and caps the pointed end of an actin fil - ament , which then elongates at the fast - growing barbed end , and binds to the side of filaments leading to cross - links and branches ( Mullins et al . , 1998a , b ; Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) . These activities enable the construction of filament networks , such as those observed in the lamelli - podia of migrating cells and the actin clouds around Liste - ria . In yeast , the genes encoding the subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex are required for endocytosis and the assembly , polarization , and movement of cortical actin patches ( Mc - Collum et al . , 1996 ; Moreau et al . , 1996 , 1997 ; Winter et al . , 1997 , 1999b ) .

The NH 2 - terminal head domain of the heavy chain displays actin - stimulated Mg - ATPase activity and generates a mechanochemical force ( Albanesi et al . , 1985 ; Adams and Pollard , 1986 ; Zot et al . , 1992 ; Ostap and Pollard , 1996 ) . Two functionally redun - dant genes , MYO3 and MYO5 , code for the heavy chain of yeast type I myosins . Deletion of both genes compromises several actin - dependent functions , leading to a severe growth defect or lethality depending upon the genetic background ( Goodson et al . , 1996 ; Geli and Riezman , 1996 ) . In contrast , the single mutants appear relatively normal , although myo5 D cells are particularly tempera - ture - sensitive for endocytosis ( Geli and Riezman , 1996 ; Geli et al . , 1998 ) . Myo3p and Myo5p localize to cortical patches that are enriched at sites of polarized growth and often overlap with actin patches ( Goodson et al . , 1996 ; Anderson et al . , 1998 ) . As observed for the type I myosins of Dictyostelium and Acanthamoeba ( Lee et al . , 1996 ; Br - zeska et al . , 1996 ; Novak and Titus , 1998 ) , Myo3p and Myo5p are activated through phosphorylation of a single site in the head domain by PAK - like kinases , Ste20p and Cla4p ( Wu et al . , 1996 , 1997 ) . The tails of unconventional myosins are expected to participate in molecular interac - tions that specify the role of the motor domain . Yeast type I myosin tails contain a potential phospholipid - binding do - main , followed by an SH3 domain and a COOH - terminal acidic domain ( Goodson and Spudich , 1995 ; Goodson et al . , 1996 ; Geli and Riezman , 1996 ) . Materials and Methods Yeast Strains Unless stated otherwise , yeast strains were derived from W3031A ( Mat a ade2 - 1 his3 - 11 , 15 leu2 - 3 , 112 ura3 - 1 trp1 - 1 can1 - 100 ) or W3031B ( Mat a ade2 - 1 his3 - 11 , 15 leu2 - 3 , 112 ura3 - 1 trp1 - 1 can1 - 100 ) carrying myo3 D : : HIS3 and myo5 D : : TRP1 alleles ( Anderson et al . , 1998 ) . Gene fusions leading to a COOH - terminal tag containing 3 copies of the hemagglutinin ( HA ) 1 epitope ( 3HA ) or 13 copies of the Myc epitope were constructed by PCR - based inte - gration ( Longtine et al . , 1998 ) . For coimmunoprecipitation experiments in - volving Myo3p , W3031A strains expressing Bee1p - HA , Y1836 ( myo3 D : : HIS3 BEE1 : : 3HA - TRP1 ) , and Vrp1p - HA , Y1447 ( myo3 D : : HIS3 myo5 D : : TRP1 VRP1 : : 3HA - kanMX6 ) and W3031B strains expressing Arc40p - HA , Y1790 ( myo3 D : : HIS3 ARC40 : : 3HA - kanMX6 ) , and Arc19p - HA , Y1789 ( myo3 D : : HIS3 ARC19 : : 3HA - kanMX6 ) , were transformed with pRS315 - derived plasmids encoding Myo3p ( pVL96 ) , Myo3p ( SH3 - W1157S ) ( p1754 ) , or Myo3p D AD ( p2921 ) . The Vrp1p and Bee1p coimmunoprecipitation experi - ment was performed with a W3031A strain expressing both Bee1p - HA and Vrp1p - Myc , Y2314 ( BEE1 : : 3HA - TRP1 VRP1 : : 13Myc - kanMX6 ) , and a W3031A control strain expressing Bee1p - HA , Y2312 ( BEE1 : : 3HA - TRP1 ) . In contrast to the corresponding gene deletion mutants , the BEE1 : : 3HA - TRP1 , VRP1 : : 3HA - kanMX6 , VRP1 : : 13Myc - kanMX6 , ARC40 : : 3HA - kanMX6 , and ARC19 : : 3HA - kanMX6 alleles did not perturb cell growth rate or polarity of the actin cytoskeleton , indicating they lead to functional HA - tagged proteins . For testing the genetic redundancy of the myosin - I acidic do - main and the Bee1p acidic domain , we constructed the W3031A derivatives Y1899 ( myo3 D : : HIS3 myo5 D : : TRP1 bee1 D AD : : 3HA - kanMX6 GAL1 - MYO3 ) and Y1900 ( myo3 D : : HIS3 myo5 D : : TRP1 GAL1 - MYO3 ) . Y1899 contains the bee1 D AD : : 3HA - kanMX6 allele , which was generated by PCR - based integration of a 3HA - kanMX6 cassette with primers ( 5 9 - AGCTTCAATTAGAGGGGCAGGTGGCATAGGCGCTTTGA - GAAAAGTTGACAAATCGCGGATCCCCGGGTTAATTAA - 3 9 ) and ( 5 9 - GTACATAAAATTACATATTTTCTATAACAGTAGTTTCATCT - TTGTTTGCATTCAGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAAC - 3 9 ) and resulted in deletion of 63 COOH - terminal residues of Bee1p . The bee1 D AD : : 3HA - kanMX6 allele did not perturb growth or actin organization , but produced a truncated form of Bee1p as observed by immunoblot analysis ( data not shown ) . Both Y1899 and Y1900 carry a LEU2 - based plasmid , pBK28 , encod - ing GAL1 - MYO3 . To generate Y2136 ( bee1 D AD myo3 D AD myo5 D GAL1 - MYO3 ) , Y1899 was transformed with p3147 . To generate Y2137 ( bee1 D AD MYO3 myo5 D GAL1 - MYO3 ) , Y1899 was transformed with p3145 . To gener - ate Y2138 ( BEE1 myo3 D AD myo5 D GAL1 - MYO3 ) , Y1900 was transformed with p3147 . Plasmid Construction Several yeast plasmids were derived from pRS315 ( LEU2 ) and pRS316 ( URA3 ) ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) . p1754 , a pRS315 - derived plasmid , encoding Myo3p ( SH3 - W1157S ) , was created in four steps . First , we PCR amplified a 450 - bp DNA fragment encoding Myo3p - SH3 - AD ( 1118 - 1271 ) , with primers ( 5 9 - CAACCAAAGGATCCGAAATTCGAAGCT - 3 9 ) that spanned an internal BamHI site ( underlined ) and ( 5 9 - TCGC - GACCAGTCATCATCATCATCGCCATCGT - 3 9 ) that incorporated an NruI site . Second , to create p1686 , the NruI site within the cloned product allowed blunt end addition of a linker ( 5 9 - TAGGCGGCCGCTA - 3 9 ) , such that the COOH - terminal codon of Myo3p was followed by a serine codon , a termination condon , and a NotI site . Third , the insert of p1686 provided a template for site specific mutagenesis with an oligonucleotide ( 5 9 - CTTTGCTAAAGAGCTCCCACTAGGTTCATC - 3 9 ) that changed a tryptophan codon to a serine codon and incorporated an SstI site . Fi - nally , the product was ligated into pVL96 to create p1754 . pVL96 is a pRS315 - derived plasmid carrying MYO3 ( Wu et al . , 1997 ) . Two steps cre - ated p2921 , a pRS315 - derived plasmid encoding Myo3p D AD . First , a 210 - bp DNA fragment coding for Myo3p - SH3 ( 1118 - 1188 ) was amplified by PCR , with primers ( 5 9 - CAACCAAAGGATCCGAAATTCGAAGCT - 3 9 ) that spanned an internal BamHI and ( 5 9 - GCGGCCGCCTAACGCGT - CACCGTATTTCTTGTGTCTTTATA - 3 9 ) that incorporated an MluI site , followed by termination codon and a NotI site . Second , the product was ligated into pVL96 . pBK28 is a p415GAL1 ( LEU2 ) - derived plasmid ( Mumberg et al . , 1994 ) containing GAL1 - MYO3 . To create pBK28 , MYO3 was amplified by PCR , with primers ( 5 9 - TCCCCCGGGATG - GCTTGCATAAAAAAGGG - 3 9 ) and ( 5 9 - TGCGGTCGACAAATTAA - GGAGGGTTTACTGTGCT - 3 9 ) that incorporated SmaI and SalI sites , and ligated into the p415GAL1 polylinker . p3145 was created by ligating a 5 . 4 - kb SalI to NotI fragment of MYO3 from pVL96 into pRS316 . p3147 , a pRS316 - derived plasmid encoding Myo3p D AD , was created by substi - tuting the BamHI to NotI fragment of p3145 with the BamHI to NotI fragment from p2921 . To create p1704 , encoding GST - Myo3p - SH3 - AD , we ligated the insert from p1686 in frame with the GST - sequences of a pGEX - 3X – derived vector . To create p2924 , encoding GST - Myo3p - SH3 , we ligated the p2921 DNA fragment encoding Myo3p - SH3 ( 1118 - 1188 ) in frame with GST - sequences of pGEX - 3X . A three - step process was used to create p2925 , encoding GST - Myo3p - AD . First , we PCR amplified a 270 - bp fragment of MYO3 with primers ( 5 9 - GGATCCAAACAA - GAAATACGGTGCCTGTTG - 3 9 and ( 5 9 - TCGCGACCAGTCATCAT - CATCATCGCCATCGT - 3 9 ) that incorporated a BamHI and NruI sites . Second , we replaced the NruI site with linker ( 5 9 - TAGGCGGCCGCTA - 3 9 ) such that the COOH - terminal codon of Myo3p was followed by a serine codon , a termination condon , and a NotI site . Finally , the product was ligated in frame with the GST - sequences of a pGEX - 3X derived vec - tor . A two - step process was used to create p1746 , encoding Myo3p - GFP . First , we ligated the 450 - bp BamHI to NruI fragment containing Myo3p - SH3 - AD ( 1118 - 1271 ) in frame with the GFP sequences carried on a pRS316 - derived vector , p1444 . A NotI site occurs downstream of the GFP sequence in p1444 , which enabled ligation of a BamHI to NotI fragment encoding Myo3p - SH3 - AD - GFP into pVL96 , creating p1746 . To create p1753 , encoding Myo3p ( SH3 - W1157S ) - GFP , we ligated the 450 - bp BamHI to NruI fragment of Myo3p ( SH3 - W1157S ) into p1746 . A two - step process was used to create p2967 , encoding Myo3p D AD - GFP . First , the NruI site in p1746 was changed to MluI with a linker ( 5 9 - ATAACGCGT - TAT - 3 9 ) , creating p1880 . Second , the BamHI to MluI fragment encoding Myo3p - SH3 ( 1118 - 1188 ) was ligated into p1180 , creating p2967 . Two - hybrid constructs were based on pEG202 ( Gyuris et al . , 1993 ) , which encodes the LexA DNA binding domain , and pJG4 - 5 ( Gyuris et al . , 1 Abbreviations used in this paper : AD , acidic domain ; DIC , differential in - terference contrast ; GFP , green fluorescent protein ; GST , glutathione - S - transferase ; HA , hemagglutinin ; MBP , maltose binding protein ; SH3 , Src homology domain 3 ; WH2 , WASP homology domain 2 . Evangelista et al . A Role for Myosin - I in Actin Assembly 355 1993 ) , which encodes the B42 transcriptional activation domain . p1190 contains an EcoRI fragment encoding Myo3p ( 1054 - 1271 ) that was iso - lated in a two - hybrid screen with the proline - rich FH1 domain of Bni1p as the bait . DNA fragments of various genes were amplified by the poly - merase chain reaction ( PCR ) with primers that incorporated 5 9 - BamHI and 3 9 - NotI restriction sites for insertion into the two - hybrid vectors . pEG202 derived plasmids were : p2601 , encoding Arc19p ; p2605 , encoding Arc40p ; p3186 , encoding Bee1p ( 1 - 633 ) ; p3174 , encoding Bee1p ( 1 - 165 ) ; p3037 , encoding Bee1p ( 166 - 633 ) ; p3268 , encoding Vrp1p ( 1 - 817 ) . pJG4 - 5 – derived plasmids were : p1706 , encoding Myo3p - SH3 - AD ( 1118 - 1271 ) ( Anderson et al . , 1998 ) ; p1475 , encoding Myo5p - SH3 - AD ( 1020 - 1219 ) ; p2923 , encoding Myo3p - SH3 ( 1118 - 1188 ) ; p2926 , encoding Myo3p - AD ( 1182 - 1271 ) ; p3023 , encoding Myo3p - AD D W ( 1182 - 1270 ) ; p3020 , encod - ing Myo3p - AD - 32 ( 1239 - 1271 ) ; p2819 , encoding Bee1p - WH2 - AD ( 531 - 633 ) ; p1740 , encoding Myo3p - SH3 ( W1157S ) - AD ( 1118 - 1271 ) ; p1387 en - coding Vrp1p ( 1 - 200 ) ( Anderson et al . , 1998 ) ; p1389 encoding Vrp1p ( 195 - 817 ) ( Anderson et al . , 1998 ) . To create p3224 carrying a DNA fragment coding for MBP - Vrp1p ( 1 - 200 ) , the insert from p1386 was ligated in frame with the MBP - sequences of pMAL - c2 ( New England Biolabs ) . To create p3349 carrying a DNA fragment coding for MBP - Vrp1p ( 211 - 437 ) , a 680 - bp fragment of VRP1 was PCR amplified with primers ( 5 9 - GGGAATTCTCTAATATTTCT - CTTCCTAGTGTG ) and ( 5 9 - GGGTCGACTCATACTGACGTTGCAA - CCGAAGGA ) that incorporated EcoRI and SalI sites ( underlined ) , and the product was ligated in frame with the MBP - sequences of pMAL - c2 . To create p3385 carrying a DNA fragment coding for MBP - Bee1p ( 213 - 222 ) , synthetic oligonucleotides ( 5 9 - AATTCGCACCGACTACCCCAG - CCCCTGCTCTTCCTG - 3 9 ) and ( 5 9 - TCGACAGGAAGAGCAGGGGC - TGGGGTAGTCGGTGCG - 3 9 ) that incorporated EcoRI and SalI sticky ends ( underlined ) and coded for Bee1p ( 213 - 222 ) were ligated in frame with the MBP - sequences of pMAL - c2 . Two Hybrid Analysis Two hybrid experiments ( Phizicky and Fields , 1995 ) were performed by mating Y1026 ( Mat a ura3 - 1 : : URA3lexAop - lacZ leu2 - 3 , 112 his3 - 11 , 15 trp1 - 1 ade2 - 1 can1 - 100 ) , which contained a LexA DNA - binding domain plasmid , and Y860 ( Mat a ura3 - 1 : : URA3 lexAop - ADE2 leu2 - 3 , 112 his3 - 11 , 15 trp1 - 1 ade2 - 1 can1 - 100 ) , which contained a transcriptional - activation domain plasmid . Diploids were grown in liquid culture to mid - log phase and as - sayed for expression of lexAop - lacZ as described ( Hagen et al . , 1991 ) . Each value represents the average and standard deviation for three inde - pendent quantifications . Coimmunoprecipitation Experiments Yeast cells were grown to early log phase and extracts were prepared by liquid nitrogen grinding in lysis buffer ( 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 50 mM Tris - HCl , 100 mM NaCl , and 10 mM EDTA ) with a protease inhibitor cocktail ( 10 mM Pefabloc , 50 m g / ml leupeptin , 50 m g / ml pepstatin A , 50 m g / ml E64 , 50 m g / ml antipain , 50 m g / ml chymostatin , 20 mM benzamidine , and 50 m g / ml aprotinin from Boehringer Mannheim ) . Immunoprecipitations were carried out with 1 . 5 - ml extracts , containing 20 – 25 mg / ml total protein , monoclonal antibody HA . 11 ( Berkeley Antibody Company ) , and G – Seph - arose beads ( Pharmacia ) . For immunoblot analysis , 25 m g of total protein was loaded for detection of proteins in the yeast extract , 10 % of the total immunoprecipitated material was loaded for detection of the immunopre - cipitated protein and 90 % was loaded for detection of the coimmunopre - cipitated protein . The resultant proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis ( Peter et al . , 1993 ) , using rabbit polyclonal HA antibody ( Berke - ley Antibody Company ) , rabbit polyclonal c - myc antibody ( Santa Cruz ) , and rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against Myo3p . In each experi - ment , z 20 % of the HA - tagged protein was immunoprecipitated . For the coimmunoprecipitation of Myo3p with Arc40p - HA , Bee1p - HA , and Vrp1p - HA , z 1 % of the total Myo3p in the extract coimmunoprecipitated in each case . For Myo3p ( SH3 - W1157S ) , z 0 . 1 % coimmunoprecipitated with Arc40p - HA . For Myo3p D AD , z 1 % coimmunoprecipitated with Bee1p - HA and Vrp1p - HA . For Vrp1p - Myc , z 5 % coimmunoprecipitated with Bee1p - HA . Purified GST - Myo3p ( 952 - 1114 ) was used to generate rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Myo3p . pGST - Myo3p ( 952 - 1114 ) was created by blunt end ligation of a BsaAI to NcoI fragment pVL96 . 1 ( Wu et al . , 1997 ) into SmaI site of pGEX - 4T2 ( Pharmacia ) . The antigen was then affinity puri - fied by coupling 1 mg of purified GST and GST - Myo3p ( 952 - 1114 ) to a NHS - activated HiTrap column . Both columns were then mounted on a BioCad ( Perseptive Biosystems ) . 5 ml of the polyclonal rabbit anti - Myo3p antiserum was applied to the columns , washed with 50 mM sodium phos - phate buffer , and eluted using 0 . 1 M glycine / HCl pH 2 . 7 . Peak fractions containing the anti - Myo3p antibody were collected and neutralized . GST Pulldown Experiments Yeast extracts from strains Y1790 and Y1789 were prepared by growing strains to mid - log in 50 ml culture and then grinding cells with glass beads in lysis buffer ( 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 50 mM Tris - HCl , 100 mM NaCl , and 10 mM EDTA ) . Escherichia coli strain BL21 ( Novagen ) was transformed with pGEX - 3X ( Pharmacia ) , p1704 , p2924 , and p2925 , and induced to ex - press GST , GST - Myo3p - SH3 - AD , GST - Myo3p - SH3 , and GST - Myo3p - AD , respectively . GST proteins were purified on glutathione - Sepharose beads , then mixed with yeast extracts ( 45 min ) and prepared for immuno - blot analysis ( Evangelista et al . , 1997 ) using monoclonal antibody HA . 11 ( Berkeley Antibody Company ) , and monoclonal GST antibody ( Santa Cruz ) . For direct protein – protein interaction experiments , BL21 lysates containing MBP - Vrp1p ( 1 - 200 ) ( p3224 ) , MBP - Vrp1p ( 211 - 437 ) ( p3349 ) , or MBP - Bee1p ( 213 - 222 ) ( p3385 ) were mixed with purified GST proteins purified from BL21 cells expressing pGEX - 3X ( Pharmacia ) , GST - Myo3p - SH3 - AD ( p1704 ) , or GST - Myo3p - SH3 ( W1157S ) - AD ( p1741 ) and pre - pared for immunoblot analysis ( Evangelista et al . , 1997 ) using monoclonal MBP antibody ( New England Biolabs ) and monoclonal GST antibody ( Santa Cruz ) . Identification of Myosin - I SH3 Domain Ligands A random peptide 2 - hybrid library ( Yang et al . , 1995 ) was screened with p1190 , a pEG202 bait plasmid encoding Myo3p - SH3 - AD . From approxi - mately 1 . 5 million transformants , 2 positives were identified . To confirm these interactions , we synthesized oligonucleotides coding for the identi - fied proline - rich peptides , PRP1 and PRP2 , and cloned them into pEG202 for further analysis . Baits coding for derivatives of PRP2 , in which alanine residues were substituted for particular prolines , were also constructed . pEG202 peptide bait plasmids were p2674 , which contains BamHI to NotI fragment encoding peptide PRP1 ( QPDHPPPSPP ) ; p2627 , which contains BamHI to NotI fragment encoding peptide PRP2 ( PPPYQAPHPP ) ; p2675 which contains BamHI to NotI fragment encoding peptide PRP2 - 1 ( PPPYQAPH A P ) ; p2676 which contains BamHI to NotI fragment en - coding peptide PRP2 - 2 ( P A PYQAPHPP ) ; p2718 which contains BamHI to NotI fragment encoding peptide PRP2 - 3 ( PPPYQA A HPP ) ; p2730 which contains BamHI to NotI fragment encoding peptide PRP2 - 4 ( PPP - YQAPHP A ) ; p2880 which contains a BamHI to NotI fragment encoding a peptide PBS2 ( NKPLPPLPVA ) that was derived from amino acids 92 - 101 of Pbs2p . p2637 , a pJG4 - 5 – derived plasmid encoding the SH3 domain of Sho1p ( 176 - 367 ) , was a positive control for peptide PBS2 ( Maeda et al . , 1995 ) . Pattern match analysis was carried out at the Saccharomyces Genome Database ( http : / / genome - www . stanford . edu / saccharomyces / ) . Analysis of Myo3p Tail Mutants and Localization of Myo3p - GFP Derivatives To assess the function of Myo3p mutants , we transformed RH3384 ( myo5 D : : TRP1 myo3 D : : HIS3 lys2 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 bar1 ) carrying p MYO5 , a URA3 - based plasmid ( Geli and Riezman , 1996 ) , with pRS315 or pRS315 - derived plasmids coding for Myo3p ( p1182 ) , Myo3p - D AD ( p2921 ) , Myo3p ( SH3W1157S ) ( p1754 ) , Myo3p - GFP ( p1746 ) , Myo3p D AD - GFP ( p2967 ) , Myo3p ( SH3W1157S ) - GFP ( p1753 ) . These plasmids carry MYO3 derivatives under control of the endogenous promoter . Transfor - mants were then transferred to medium containing 5 - Fluoroorotic ( 5 - FOA ) to select for cells that lack p MYO5 ( Boeke et al . , 1987 ) . Viable cells were assayed for doubling time and stained with rhodamine - phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) to visualize filamentous actin ( Adams and Pringle , 1991 ) . In the RH3384 genetic background , myo3 D myo5 D double mutants are lethal ( Geli and Riezman , 1996 ) and , as expected , we failed to isolate 5 - FOA 1 colonies from the RH3384 cells transformed with pRS315 . p1182 , p2921 , p1754 , p1746 , p2967 , and p1753 rescued the myo3 D myo5 D lethality and were associated with a doubling time of 94 6 4 , 92 6 4 , 130 6 9 , 100 6 4 , 92 6 7 , and 166 6 9 min , respectively ; these plasmids resulted in polarization of actin cables and patches towards the growing bud in 96 6 1 , 93 6 3 , 74 6 8 , 96 6 2 , 97 6 1 , and 41 6 9 % of the cells , respectively . For The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 148 , 2000 356 localization of Myo3p - GFP derivatives , W3031A was transformed with p1746 , p2967 and p1753 , and observed by fluorescence microscopy with the fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set . Analysis of bee1 D AD myo3 D AD myo5 D Cells Growth rate and filamentous actin organization was observed for three strains , Y2136 ( bee1 D AD myo3 D AD myo5 D GAL1 - MYO3 ) , Y2137 ( bee1 D AD myo5 D GAL1 - MYO3 ) , and Y2138 ( myo3 D AD myo5 D GAL1 - MYO3 ) after repression of GAL1 - MYO3 . These strains were grown on synthetic medium that selected for the transformed plasmids , but varied in carbon source . For the plate growth assay , cells were propagated on 2 % galactose medium , where they express GAL1 - MYO3 , then streaked on 2 % glucose medium to score colony formation after GAL1 - MYO3 repres - sion . To visualize the actin cytoskeleton after GAL1 - MYO3 repression , Y2136 cells were grown to mid - log phase in 2 % galactose medium , trans - ferred to 2 % glucose medium , then stained for filamentous actin with rhodamine - phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) as described ( Adams and Prin - gle , 1991 ) . For the GAL1 - MYO3 reinduction experiment , Y2136 cells were first grown to mid - log phase in 2 % galactose medium , then shifted to 2 % glucose medium for 1 h , washed and shifted to 2 % raffinose medium for 27 h , and finally shifted back to 2 % galactose medium for 2 h . Results COOH - terminal Acidic Domains of Myo3p and Myo5p Interact with the Arp2 / 3 Complex The Myo3p and Myo5p COOH - terminal acidic domain ( AD ) shares homology with the acidic COOH - terminal Arp2 / 3 - binding domain of Bee1p and other WASP - family proteins ( Fig . 1 ) . To explore the possibility that myosin - I also associates with the Arp2 / 3 complex , we constructed two - hybrid baits for each of the yeast subunits ( Arp2p , Arp3p , Arc15p , Arc18p , Arc19p , Arc35p , and Arc40p ) and performed pair - wise tests for interaction with the my - osin - I tails . Initially , we analyzed tails containing both SH3 and acidic domains , Myo3p - SH3 - AD and Myo5p - SH3 - AD . Two Arp2 / 3 complex subunits , Arc19p and Arc40p , interacted with the tails of Myo3p and Myo5p ( Table I ) . From a similar analysis of Bee1p COOH - terminal se - quences , we detected an interaction with Arc40p specifi - cally ( Table I ) . Because other subunits of the Arp2 / 3 com - plex also interact with the Arc19p and Arc40p two - hybrid baits ( data not shown ) , the observed interactions may in - volve a bridging protein or the entire Arp2 / 3 complex . My - osin - I and the Arp2 / 3 complex both localize to cortical ac - tin patches ( Goodson et al . , 1996 ; McCollum et al . , 1996 ; Moreau et al . , 1996 , 1997 ; Winter et al . , 1997 , 1999b ) , sug - gesting these interactions may occur for full - length pro - teins in vivo . To test this possibility , hemagglutinin A ( HA ) epitope - tagged proteins , Arc40p - HA and Arc19p - HA , were immunoprecipitated from yeast extracts and an - alyzed by Western immunoblotting with antibodies spe - cific for HA and Myo3p . Indeed , we found that Myo3p coimmunoprecipitates specifically with both Arc40p and Arc19p ( Fig . 2 A ) . Approximately 20 % of the total Arc40p - HA was immunoprecipitated from the yeast ex - tract and z 1 % of the total Myo3p coimmunoprecipitated ( Materials and Methods ) . We conclude that yeast myosin - I proteins associate with the cortical Arp2 / 3 complex through their COOH - terminal tails . To identify sequences within the Myo3p tail required for this association , we tested a series of Myo3p tail mutants for Arc40p two - hybrid interactions ( Table I ) . Deletion of the acidic domain leads to a Myo3p tail containing only the SH3 domain , Myo3p - SH3 , and abolished interaction with Arc40p . In contrast , a tail containing only the acidic domain , Myo3p - AD , remained competent for the Arc40p interaction . A con - struct lacking the conserved COOH - terminal tryptophan of the acidic domain , Myo3p - AD D W , failed to interact with Arc40p , whereas an NH2 - truncated acidic domain contain - ing the last 32 residues , Myo3p - AD32 , still interacted . Thus , the sequences of Myo3p that share homology with the tail of Bee1p mediate the Arc40p two - hybrid interaction ( Fig . 1 ) . Confirmation of these two - hybrid interactions was obtained with glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) - Myo3p tail fusions pu - rified from E . coli and hemagglutinin A ( HA ) epitope - tagged Arc40p produced in yeast . Myo3p - SH3 - AD and Myo3p - AD associated with Arc40p - HA , whereas Myo3p - SH3 did not ( Fig . 2 B ) . Similar experiments confirmed that the Arc19p - HA interaction was also mediated through the acidic domain ( Fig . 2 B ) . Moreover , the acidic domains of Myo3p and Myo5p have been shown to bind directly to puri - fied Arp2 / 3 complex with an affinity similar to that of the Bee1p acidic domain ( Lechler , T . , and R . Li , personal com - munication ) . These observations suggest the acidic domain Figure 1 .

Analysis of Myo3p SH3 Domain and Acidic Domain Mutants To examine the specific roles of the Myo3p tail domains , we created SH3 and acidic domain mutants . A single amino acid substitution of a conserved tryptophan residue within the SH3 domain resulted in a mutant protein , Myo3p ( SH3 - W1157S ) , that was severely mislocalized ( Fig . 2 C ) and only partially rescued the growth and actin polarity defects of myo3 D myo5 D cells ( Materials and Methods ) . Similar ob - servations were made for a Myo5p mutant deleted for the SH3 domain ( Anderson et al . , 1998 ) . In comparison to wild - type Myo3p , a reduced amount of Myo3p ( SH3 - W1157S ) coimmunoprecipitated with Arc40p - HA ( Fig . 2 D ) . This finding was somewhat surprising because the Myo3p ( SH3 - W1157S ) substitution did not abolish the Arc40p two - hybrid interaction ( Table I ) , however , it may be explained by the mislocalization of Myo3p ( SH3 - W1157S ) , which could preclude an association with Arc40p in vivo . Thus , the SH3 domain is critical for both function and cortical local - ization of Myo3p . We also constructed a Myo3p mutant de - leted for the acidic domain , Myo3p D AD . This protein local - ized to cortical patches ( Fig . 2 C ) and fully rescued the growth and actin defects of a myo3 D myo5 D double - mutant but failed to coimmunoprecipitate with Arc40p - HA ( Fig . 2 D ) . Thus , the Myo3p acidic domain is required for the Myo3p - Arc40p association , but is not required for Myo3p localization or function in otherwise wild - type cells . Myo3p Acidic Domain is Functionally Redundant with the Bee1p Acidic Domain The COOH - terminal Arp2 / 3 - binding domain of Bee1p is dispensable for its actin assembly function in vivo ( Winter et al . , 1999a ) . Therefore , we decided to test if Myo3p and Myo5p formed a complex with Bee1p in which the myo - sin - I acidic domain was functionally redundant with the Bee1p acidic domain . Indeed , both yeast myosin - I tails showed a two - hybrid interaction with Bee1p ( Table II ) . The Myo3p SH3 domain was necessary and sufficient for the interaction , which occurred through both NH 2 - and COOH - terminal fragments of Bee1p ( Table II ) . Coimmu - noprecipitation of Myo3p with Bee1p - HA confirmed this was a bona fide interaction in vivo ( Fig . 3 A ) . Further - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 148 , 2000 358 more , deletion of the Myo3p acidic domain did not per - turb the Myo3p - Bee1p association , whereas the Myo3p ( SH3 - W1157S ) substitution abolished it ( Fig . 3 A ) . Thus , Bee1p associates with the myosin - I SH3 domain . To test for functional redundancy of the myosin - I and Bee1p Arp2 / 3 - binding domains , we generated myo5 D cells carrying a deletion of the acidic domain of Bee1p , the acidic domain of Myo3p , or both . These cells contained the MYO3 gene regulated by the GAL1 promoter , GAL1 - MYO3 , which allowed us to first grow cells on galactose medium , where they expressed MYO3 , and then shift to glucose medium ( a repressing carbon source ) to reveal the mutant phenotype . On glucose medium , both the sin - gle tail - deletion mutants , bee1 D AD and myo3 D AD , grew normally , whereas the double - mutant , bee1 D AD myo3 D AD , showed a severe growth defect ( Fig . 3 B ) . Af - ter shift of the bee1 D AD myo3 D AD double - mutant from galactose to glucose , actin patches first depolarized and then appeared to disassemble ( Fig . 3 C ) . Immunoblot analysis of these cells at 0 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , and 28 h after the shift from galactose to glucose medium revealed the Myo3p level was reduced by z 50 % within 5 h after glu - cose addition , and below detectable levels within 25 h ( data not shown ) . At 0 h , 71 6 10 % of the cells stained for fila - mentous actin structures and 100 % of these cells showed actin cables and patches polarized towards the growing bud ; at 15 h , 40 6 7 % stained for filamentous actin struc - tures and 38 6 3 % of these cells were polarized ; at 28 h , 2 6 1 % stained for filamentous actin structures , none were polarized , and a fraction of the cells ( z 30 % ) appeared to lyse . To determine if the disassembly of filamentous actin structures was reversible , we carried out a GAL1 - MYO3 reinduction experiment . bee1 D AD myo3 D AD double - mutants were first grown to mid - log phase in galactose medium , then shifted to glucose medium for 1 h , to raffi - nose medium ( a nonrepressing but non - inducing carbon source ) for 27 h , and finally back to galactose medium to re - induce expression of GAL1 - MYO3 . Before re - induc - tion of GAL1 - MYO3 , , 1 % of the cells contained visible filamentous actin ; 30 min after galactose addition , 1 . 7 6 0 . 3 % cells contained filamentous actin ; 2 h after galactose addition , 49 . 5 6 3 . 2 % of cells contained filamentous actin and 88 . 1 6 4 . 5 % showed polarized cables and patches ( Fig . 3 C ) . Thus , the myosin - I acidic domain plays an es - sential actin assembly role in cells defective for Bee1p - mediated Arp2 / 3 - activation . Myo3p and Myo5p SH3 Domains Bind Proline - rich Ligands in Bee1p and Vrp1p The tails of Myo3p and Myo5p , containing both the SH3 and the acidic domains , also display two - hybrid interac - tions with Vrp1p ( Verprolin ) ( Anderson et al . , 1998 ) , a proline - rich actin - binding protein that shows genetic and two - hybrid interactions with Bee1p ( Naqvi et al . , 1998 ) . The Vrp1p - Bee1p two - hybrid interaction ( Table II ) was confirmed in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation of Myc epitope - tagged Vrp1p , Vrp1p - Myc , with Bee1p - HA ( Fig . 4 A ) . The Vrp1p - Bee1p complex appears to be conserved both structurally and functionally with human WIP - WASP ( Ramesh et al . , 1997 ; Vaduva et al . , 1999 ) . We observed that the Myo3p SH3 domain was necessary and sufficient for the Myo3p - Vrp1p two - hybrid interactions ( Table II ) . These findings were confirmed through coim - munoprecipitation experiments involving Vrp1p - HA and Myo3p tail mutants ( Fig . 4 B ) . Deletion of the Myo3p acidic domain did not affect association with Vrp1p , whereas the Myo3p ( SH3 - W1157S ) substitution abolished it ( Fig . 4 B ) . Myo5p also forms a cortical complex with Vrp1p ( Anderson et al . , 1998 ) . Thus , myosin - I proteins as - sociate with both Vrp1p and Bee1p in an SH3 - dependent manner . To identify ligands specific for the myosin - I SH3 do - mains , we screened a two - hybrid random peptide library for interaction with a bait containing the Myo3p tail . Two proline - rich peptides , PRP1 and PRP2 , were identified and confirmed to interact with the tails of both Myo3p and Myo5p ( Table III ) . This interaction was specific because the myosin - I tails failed to interact with a peptide , PBS2 , that binds the Sho1p SH3 domain ( Table III ) . Moreover , the Myo3p ( SH3 - W1157S ) substitution abolished the inter - action , indicating that it was dependent upon SH3 domain function . Several derivatives of PRP2 were also tested for interaction with the Myo3p tail ( Table III ) . Our findings in - dicate that PxxxxPxxP ( P is proline , x is any amino acid ) represents a minimal consensus sequence for both the Myo3p and the Myo5p SH3 ligand . Pattern match analysis of all predicted yeast proteins showed that Bee1p has 4 po - tential Myo3 / 5p SH3 ligands and Vrp1p has 17 potential ligands , the most abundant of any yeast protein . Indeed , we found that maltose binding protein ( MBP ) fusions to Vrp1p ( 1 - 200 ) , Vrp1p ( 211 - 437 ) , and Bee1p ( 213 - 222 ) bound directly to a GST fusion of Myo3p - SH3 - AD but not Table II .

A Role for Myosin - I in Actin Assembly 359 to Myo3p - SH3 ( W1157S ) - AD ( Fig . 4 C ) . The proline rich domains of Bee1p and Vrp1p may thus function as a scaf - fold for assembly of multiple myosin - I molecules . During steady - state ATP hydrolysis , myosin - I , like skeletal muscle myosin - II , is weakly bound to an actin filament ( Ostap and Pollard , 1996 ) ; therefore , multiple myosin - I molecules must be clustered to support processive motility along actin filaments ( Albanesi et al . , 1985 ; Adams and Pollard , 1986 ; Zot et al . , 1992 ; Ostap and Pollard , 1996 ) . Discussion We suggest that Myo3p , Myo5p , Vrp1p , and Bee1p form a complex that controls Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin assembly ( Fig . 5 ) . The WH2 ( WASP homology 2 ) domain of WASP - like proteins binds globular actin and is required for efficient actin nucleation in vitro , suggesting it may couple actin monomers to the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ; Egile et al . , 1999 ; Machesky et al . , 1999 ; Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ; Suetsugu et al . , 1999 ; Winter et al . , 1999a ) . Bee1p and Vrp1p each contain a WH2 domain ( Fig . 5 ) ; therefore , the WH2 domain and the acidic Arp2 / 3 - binding domain of Bee1p would be functionally redundant within a Myo3 / 5p - Vrp1p - Bee1p complex , providing an ex - planation for the surprising lack of phenotype associated with a Bee1p mutant truncated for both these domains ( Winter et al . , 1999a ) . In gel filtration experiments , we find that z 10 % of the soluble Arc40p - HA elutes in high molecular mass fractions that also contain Myo3p , Myo5p , and Bee1p - HA ( unpublished observations ) . Activation of Myo3p and Myo5p requires phosphoryla - tion of the head domain by Ste20p or Cla4p , PAK - like ki - nases that function as effectors of Cdc42p ( GTP ) , suggest - ing myosin - I links Cdc42p signaling to Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin assembly ( Wu et al . , 1996 , 1997 ; Eby et al . , 1998 ) . In a variation of this theme , Cdc42p ( GTP ) binds directly to mammalian N - WASP to control the activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) . In yeast , the components of the Myo3 / 5p - Vrp1p - Bee1p complex and the Arp2 / 3 com - plex appear to be particularly important for endocytosis Figure 3 . Myo3p associates with Bee1p and Vrp1p and partici - pates in actin assembly . ( A ) Coimmunoprecipitation of Myo3p with Bee1p - HA . Extracts prepared from cells expressing Bee1p - HA and either Myo3p , Myo3p ( W1157S ) , or Myo3p D AD , were immunoprecipitated with anti - HA . Immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis with anti - Myo3p ( top ) or anti - HA ( bottom ) . ( B ) The COOH - terminal acidic domain of my - osin - I is genetically redundant with the COOH - terminal acidic domain of Bee1p . myo5 D strains expressing GAL1 - MYO3 and carrying either myo3 D AD , bee1 D AD , or bee1 D AD myo3 D AD , were streaked on galactose medium or glucose medium to assess colony formation . ( C ) The acidic domain of myosin - I is essential for assembly of filamentous actin structures in cells depleted COOH - terminal acidic domain of Bee1p . bee1 D AD myo3 D AD myo5 D cells expressing GAL1 - MYO3 were shifted from galactose to glucose medium and stained with rhodamine - phalloidin at in - creasing time points to visualize filamentous actin ( top ) . Cells de - pleted of Myo3p after 28 h of growth in raffinose medium were shifted back into galactose medium , to reinduce GAL1 - MYO3 , for 2 h ( bottom ) . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 148 , 2000 360 ( Munn et al . , 1995 ; Geli and Riezman , 1996 ; Geli et al . , 1998 ; Naqvi et al . , 1998 ; Winter et al . , 1999b ) , supporting a role for actin assembly in the formation and movement of endocytotic vesicles ( Merrifield et al . , 1999 ) . A carboxyl - terminal acidic domain is present only in myosin - I proteins of S . cerevisiae , Candida albicans , Schizosaccharomyces pombe , and Aspergillus nidulans , suggesting a direct interaction with myosin - I and the Arp2 / 3 complex may be fungal specific . However , in view of both the functional conservation of the Vrp1p - Bee1p - Arp2 / 3 interactions and the structural conservation of my - osin - I SH3 domains , we anticipate that metazoan myosin - I motors are also linked to Arp2 / 3 complexes through an as - sociation with WASP - like adapters . Indeed , the absence of a metazoan acidic domain may reflect the observed functional redundancy in yeast . In further support of a role for myosin - I in actin assembly , we have also detected a Myo3 / 5p - Bni1p interaction ( unpublished observations ) , which suggests that formins and other adapter proteins may employ myosin - I motors during the assembly of spe - cific actin structures . Dynamic arrays of actin filaments involved in cell move - ment , morphogenesis , and other motility processes , must be continually assembled at growing barbed ends and de - polymerized at the pointed ends ( Drubin and Nelson , 1996 ; Mitchison and Cramer , 1996 ; Mullins et al . , 1998a , b ; Machesky and Insall , 1998 , 1999 ; Suetsugu et al . , 1999 ; Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) . Myosin - I moves towards the barbed end of actin filaments and may function to trans - port WASP - like adapter - Arp2 / 3 machinery towards sites of active assembly . In addition to their role in nucleation , WASP - like adapters may be involved in the subsequent elongation of filaments ( Egile et al . , 1999 ) , raising an alter - native possibility that myosin - I plays an active role in actin polymerization . Because the barbed ends of filaments tend to orient towards the nucleating site ( Zigmond et al . , 1998 ) , myosin - I motors could tether polymerizing fila - ments to assembly machinery and control new monomer addition or filament organization ( Mitchison , 1992 ; Sheetz et al . , 1992 ) . Analogous functions have been proposed for Figure 4 . Myosin - I SH3 domain binds proline - rich ligands in Bee1p and Vrp1p . ( A ) Coimmunoprecipi - tation of Vrp1p - Myc with Bee1p - HA .

The Myo3 / 5p SH3 domain ( cir - cle ) binds to Vrp1p and Bee1p . Myo3 / 5p and Bee1p bind and stimulate the nucleating activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex through their COOH - terminal acidic domains ( arrow ) . The WH2 do - mains of Bee1p and Vrp1p bind and couple actin monomers to the Arp2 / 3 complex for efficient actin nucleation . To represent the WH2 domains , actin monomers are shown bound to Bee1p and Vrp1p . The interaction of the Arp2 / 3 complex with the regu - latory acidic domains of Myo3p , Myo5p , and Bee1p is expected to be transient . Activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex leads to its in - corporation into the actin cytoskeleton , either as a cap on the pointed end of an actin filament or attached to the side of a fila - ment , creating cross - links and branches . The head domain of my - osin - I ( oval ) may organize the newly formed filaments , displace filaments to facilitate barbed - ended insertion , or transport the Vrp1p - Bee1p - Arp2 / 3 actin assembly complex to the barbed end of a growing actin filament .
