Here we apply modular “plug and play” design principles to a microscale solid phase protein display system that enables protein purification and functional assays for biotherapeutics . Specifically , we capture protein molecules from cell lysates on polyacrylamide hydrogel display beads ( ‘PHD beads’ ) , made in microfluidic droplet generators . These monodisperse PHD beads are decorated with predefined amounts of anchors , methacrylate - PEG - benzylguanine ( BG ) and methacrylate - PEG - chloroalkane ( CA ) . Anchors form covalent bonds with fusion proteins bearing cognate tag recognition ( SNAP and Halo - tags ) in specific , orthogonal and stable fashion . Given that these anchors are copolymerised throughout the 3D structure of the beads , proteins are also distributed across the entire bead sphere , allowing attachment of ~ 10 9 protein molecules per bead ( Æ 20 µm ) . This mode of attachment reaches a higher density than possible on widely used surface - modified beads , and additionally mitigates surface effects that often complicate studies with proteins on beads . We showcase a diverse array of protein modules that enable the secondary capture of proteins , either non - covalently ( IgG and SUMO - tag ) or covalently ( SpyCatcher , SpyTag , SnpCatcher and SnpTag ) . Proteins can be displayed in their monomeric forms , but also reformatted as a multivalent display ( using secondary capture modules that create branches ) to test the contributions of avidity and multivalency towards protein function . Finally , controlled release of modules by irradiation of light is achieved by incorporating the photocleavable protein PhoCl : irradiation severs the displayed protein from the solid support , so that functional assays can be carried out in solution . As a demonstration of the utility of valency engineering , an antibody drug screen is performed , in which an anti - TRAIL - R1 scFv protein is released into solution as monomers - hexamers , showing a ~ 50 - fold enhanced potency in the pentavalent format . The ease of protein purification on solid support , quantitative control over presentation and release of proteins and choice of valency make this experimental format a versatile , modular platform for large scale functional analysis of proteins , in bioassays of protein - protein interactions , enzymatic catalysis and bacteriolysis . Introduction The analysis of proteins , and their use as therapeutics , 1 enzymes in biocatalysis 2 and bioremediation , 3 growth factors for tissue culture 4 or targets for binder discovery campaigns 5 is often facilitated by the ability to capture , maintain and manipulate proteins on biocompatible surfaces . Protein solid - phase immobilisation is critical to many bioassays ( e . g . ELISA 6 and SPR 7 for investigating protein : protein interactions ) as it enables washing , modification or rebuffering steps and interfaces with robotic workflows , using the protein attachment to handle the protein for testing in assays or for direct analyses . Industrial - scale biocatalysis can be enhanced by the sequestration / immobilisation of valuable enzymes 2 in continuous flow biocatalysis , 8 , 9 whilst also offering potential synergistic effects through the co - localisation of specific enzymes . 10 Proteins immobilised on surfaces have also emerged as useful therapeutic agents , enhancing in vivo half - life and providing extra control over drug delivery ( both temporally and spatially ) 1 , 11 . Despite the demonstrated utility of immobilised proteins across multiple fields , the methods of immobilisation are highly diverse and typically bespoke . In addition , protein function and stability can be impacted by surface effects ( observed e . g . for immobilised targets in phage display 5 , 12 and enzymes in biocatalysis 13 – 15 ) ; spectroscopic interference ( such as autofluorescence 16 ) can negatively affect bioassay sensitivity ; the stoichiometry and strength of attachment is variable on heterogeneous solid - phase supports ; and there can be batch - to - batch variation that hampers the development of robust and reproducible protocols ( ‘beads kill leads’ ) . To address these challenges , new technologies to facilitate assay development and accelerate drug discovery pipelines are needed , based on readily synthesised reagents that can be combined as modules to broaden applicability in robust , reproducible procedures . The importance of versatility for such reagents can be conceptualised by analogy to the field of computer programming , in which there is considerable ongoing effort to produce high - quality , open - source code , and to build accessible user - facing programs based on such code : the goal is that most users ' needs will be satisfied by the package with little or no customisation , but “users” ( i . e . researchers ) are also able to understand , extend and personalise the program to perform more specialised tasks . The two design principles of modularity and robustness are thus of great importance to make a protein immobilisation system widely applicable . Robustness can be seen as the stability of protein capture over time and under different conditions , as well as the simplicity of the initial capture methodology . Robust protein capture through the trusted modular assembly of “plug and play” components thus provides molecular Lego that simplifies the design of e . g . synthetic biology 17 experiments , just as click chemistry 18 , 19 has made aspects of synthetic chemistry generalisable , easy to use and versatile . The interface of protein engineering and synthetic biology has produced a rich vein of technologies in recent years , notably : the development of SpyCatcher , amongst others 20 , 21 , as a plug and play tool for post - translational valency engineering and protein purification 22 ; the development of photocontrollable proteins such as PhoCl 23 for the spatiotemporal control of protein release via light - induced protein backbone cleavage 24 ; or new highly stable and versatile protein recognition elements such as the ALFA - tag system 25 . However few , if any , protein immobilisation methods ( e . g . Ni - NTA , Streptavidin , Protein A / G , chemical cross - linking ) interface with such technologies in a robust , modular and highly controlled manner , severely curtailing the engineerability of protein - based systems using these common technologies at their core . An “open - source” platform based on synthetic biology principles and programmable at the level of DNA sequence would shift the limit of engineerability from the availability of toolsets to the end - user’s creativity . Of the surfaces functionalised with proteins , hydrogels 26 are an increasingly important matrix for biological applications due to their biocompatibility ( permeability , adjustable stiffness , low cytotoxicity ) . They have found use in single - cell transcriptomics 27 , mammalian cell culture 28 , in vivo drug delivery devices 1 or as artificial cells 29 . In particular , surface effects can be minimised by the absence of a hydrophobic surface that can lead to protein denaturation . Hydrogels functionalised with protein have been demonstrated utilising a diverse array of capture methods ( anti - His - tag aptamers 29 , molecular imprinting 30 , click chemistry 24 , and co - polymerisation with acrylamide 31 or through disulphide bond formation 32 ) , yet no simple , modular , and site - specific method has been developed . Here , we introduce a platform that incorporates covalent , site - specific protein capture in highly modular fashion that offers stability , versatility , and accessibility . Using this technology suite , proteins can be captured at precisely defined valencies , in a highly specific and orthogonal manner , and released on demand by exposure to light , so that high - throughput affinity and enzymatic assays , bioassay sensor designs and molecular engineering strategies of biologics can be implemented . Figure 1 . Modular polyacrylamide hydrogel display ( a ) Monodisperse polyacrylamide hydrogel beads are made through the encapsulation of monomers ( 1 : Methacrylate - PEG - b enzyl g uanine ( BG ) , 2 : Methacrylate - PEG - c hloro a lkane ( CA ) , 3 : Acrylamide , 4 : Bis - acrylamide ) with polymerisation - inducing catalysts using droplet - based microfluidics . Upon de - emulsification BG ( red ) and / or CA ( blue ) are retained within each bead due to co - polymerisation with the hydrogel backbone ( b ) Hydrogel beads can then be orthogonally functionalised with SNAP - or Halo - tag fusion proteins ( red and blue , respectively ) through covalent reaction with their respective co - polymerised small molecule ligands ( BG / CA ) . Results and Discussion Design of polyacrylamide hydrogels with titratable protein capture . Synthesised from components found in most molecular biology labs ( e . g . to make SDS - PAGE gels ) and with a proven reliability of polymerisation , polyacrylamide hydrogels are easy to use and have already taken a role as biocompatible scaffolds for the delivery of reagents in microfluidic single - cell transcriptomic workflows . 27 However no simple , stable , modular technology exists for the functionalisation of polyacrylamide hydrogels with proteins . Polyacrylamide hydrogels consist of chains of monomers of acrylamide cross - linked by bis - acrylamide in stable polymers and thus , to enable the capture of proteins , we copolymerised acrylamide and bis - acrylamide monomers with methacrylate - modified small molecule ligands ( methacrylate - PEG - benzylguanine ( BG ) and - chloroalkane ( CA ) ; Figure 1a ) . These ligands act as suicide substrates for SNAP - tag 33 and Halo - tag 34 respectively , and their copolymerisation throughout the hydrogel enables completely covalent capture of an array of modular building blocks expressed as fusion proteins to these tags ( Figure 1b ) . SNAP - tag and Halo - tag are both well - established protein tags , used across biological fields and can be expressed in bacterial , a SNAP Halo + POI POI Bead O NH O O O O NH NH S O NH O O O O NH NH S + CA BG BG BG CACA b O NH O O O O NH NH S NH O O O O O O O + Bead CA BG BG BG CACA 1 2 3 4 yeast and mammalian cell lines 33 . Notably SNAP - tag and Halo - tag react entirely orthogonally with their respective ligands ( BG and CA ) , and have already been used to capture proteins on surfaces 35 , 36 , yet this orthogonality has not been fully exploited for protein capture on bifunctional surfaces , and “plug and play” modules for protein engineering and assay design have not been developed . We prepared methacrylate - PEG - benzylguanine / - chloroalkane by reacting methacrylate - NHS ester with amine - PEG - benzylguanine or - chloroalkane overnight in a simple click reaction and achieved near - quantitative yield ( > 90 % , as measured by HPLC , Figure S1 . 1 , Table S1 . 1 ) . The products of these reactions can then be directly used for co - polymerisation into polyacrylamide hydrogels , and so we subsequently generated BG - functionalised monodisperse beads of 20 µm diameter ( Ø ) using droplet - based microfluidics at ~ 8 kHz ( enabling production of 29 million beads per hour ) . 20 µm beads are readily compatible with downstream analysis technologies such as flow cytometry . However , any desired size can be made through the use of different chip geometries and flow rates . Upon de - emulsification , BG - functionalised hydrogel beads can be incubated with SNAP - tag fusion proteins ( such as SNAP - GFP ) for covalent capture ( Figure 2a ) . Specific protein capture is exemplified in Figure 2b : only beads functionalised with BG are able to capture SNAP - GFP , and there is little to no non - specific binding to non - functionalised polyacrylamide beads . PHD beads can also be made entirely without the use of microfluidics , by vortexing the aqueous monomer solution with surfactant - containing oil ( the same compositions as for microfluidics ) to create polydisperse emulsions . These polydisperse hydrogel beads vary somewhat in size but are still highly functional for capture of e . g . SNAP - GFP ( Figure S1 . 2 ) , and so this technology is also accessible to researchers without a microfluidic set - up . Next , we sought to quantify the capacity of on - bead coupling . When incubating beads ( Ø 20 µm , 50 µM BG ) with increasing amounts of SNAP - GFP , we observed asymptotic saturation of the fluorescence signal ( after washing of beads ) at approximately 5 x 10 8 SNAP - GFP molecules per bead , and we found this binding behaviour to be highly conserved even when beads are boiled before protein capture , demonstrating the high stability of this system ( Figure 2c ) . In order to estimate , more accurately , the number of molecules required to saturate a bead , we extrapolated the linear part of our saturation curve up to the asymptote . This calculation suggests that ~ 1 . 5 x 10 8 SNAP - GFP molecules per bead are bound at saturation ( equal , within experimental error , to the calculated 1 . 3 x 10 8 BG molecules per ( Ø 20 µm , 50 µM BG ) bead ; Figure S1 . 3a ) . Such high occupation levels of immobilised proteins exceed those achieved with magnetic beads that bind proteins on their surface by three orders of magnitude 37 ( M - 280 Streptavidin Dynabeads ~ 6 . 6 x 10 5 IgG molecules per bead Figure S1 . 3b ) . The difference can be ascribed to the voluminal nature of protein capture , wherein not only is the bead’s surface functionalised , but also its interior . In addition to the high levels of protein capture , it is also possible to precisely control the amount of captured protein by changing the concentration of BG monomers included in the hydrogel polymerisation mix . When the concentration of BG in the initial one - pot pre - polymerisation acrylamide mix is varied , the amount of SNAP - GFP captured varies correspondingly ; display densities spanning at least five orders of magnitude can be brought about at will , and an estimated 1 . 5 x 10 9 molecules are bound when using 500 uM BG ( Figure 2d ) , demonstrating gigavalent capture . Figure 2 . Specific , stable and titratable protein capture on polyacrylamide hydrogel beads . ( a ) BG functionalised hydrogel beads are incubated with SNAP - GFP , leading to the covalent capture of SNAP - GFP on bead . ( b ) 20 µm PHD beads + / - 50 µM BG were mixed 50 : 50 and incubated with SNAP - GFP followed by washing and imaging ( top panel brightfield , bottom panel GFP channel ) to detect specific GFP attachment .

The saturation point , i . e . where the addition of extra SNAP - GFP does not lead to an increase in on - bead fluorescent signal ( dashed line ) corresponds to a density of ~ 150 million attached proteins per bead . Black crosses indicate boiled beads , open circles indicate beads handled according to our standard procedure ( see Methods section ) . ( d ) Five sets of 20 µm PHD beads were prepared with the indicated BG loading . All were incubated with an excess of SNAP - GFP , washed , and analysed by flow cytometry . The red square highlights the 50 µM BG beads used in ( c ) , that captured 1 . 5 x 10 8 SNAP - GFP molecules per bead , the near - perfect correlation between [ BG ] and green fluorescence shows that a valency range of 10 5 - 10 9 per bead was achieved ( for 0 . 05 , 0 . 5 , 5 , 50 and 500 µM BG beads respectively ) . Data are the mean of triplicates , normalised to the background signal of PHD beads lacking BG . Specific protein capture via non - covalent secondary capture modules . To overcome the need for ad hoc solutions in assay design , we next developed a modular design principle based on the stability and specificity of covalent protein capture on bead . Such a “plug and play” engineering approach enables a researcher to assemble desired protein constructs and apply them to a designed assay or application simply by combining specific modules of defined functions . Whilst we have already demonstrated the direct capture of a protein of interest as a SNAP - tag fusion ( Figure 2 ) , it is also possible – and greatly enhances the utility of the PHD technology as an engineering tool – to use specific secondary capture modules ( e . g . affinity reagents fused to SNAP - tag ) to assemble proteins of interest on bead ( Figure 3a ) . As the base bead remains the same ( 20 µm , 50 µM BG ) , its desired functionality can be altered simply by choosing which secondary capture module to initially capture on bead . To demonstrate this principle , we fused several secondary capture modules to SNAP - tag for immobilisation : SNAP - Protein G for mouse IgG capture ( Figure 3b ) ; SNAP - I19 38 , an anti - human IgG DARPin , for human IgG capture ( Figure 3c ) ; and SNAP - YMB 39 , an anti - SUMO monobody , for capture of SUMO - GFP ( Figure 3d ) . These secondary capture modules are all readily expressed in bacteria , obviating the need to buy expensive affinity reagents for desired applications . Further secondary capture modules can be designed based on published sequences of affinity reagents or freshly developed through de novo discovery techniques such as phage display , and assembled in a modular fashion using e . g . Gibson Assembly ( details in Figure S1 . 5 , Experimental section S2 . 3 ) . Figure 3 . Versatile capture of modular building blocks for specific protein capture . ( a ) BG - functionalised hydrogel beads can be used to covalently immobilise secondary capture modules ( as SNAP - tag fusions ) that are specific for a desired target protein . ( b - d ) Functionalised PHD beads ( Ø20 µm ; 50 uM BG ) + / - ( b ) SNAP - Protein G , ( c ) SNAP - I19 or ( d ) SNAP - YMB were incubated with their respective target proteins ( Mouse IgG - iFluor 647 , human IgG1 - AlexaFluor 488 , SUMO tag - GFP ) for 1 hour , washed and analysed by both fluorescent microscopy ( left - hand panels , + / - SNAP - tag capture module mixed and imaged together ) and flow cytometry ( right - hand panels , + / - SNAP - tag capture module analysed separately and super - imposed ) . Scale bars represent 200 µm . Modular and orthogonal programming of bead functionality via covalent secondary capture modules . Next , to enable covalent immobilisation of proteins of interest , we designed additional secondary capture modules as both SNAP - and Halo - tag fusions to the suite of SpyCatcher / SpyTag and SnpCatcher / SnpTag technologies 40 ( Figure 4a ) . These protein pairs form an isopeptide bond under standard biological reaction conditions and have already been applied widely to the modular engineering of proteins ( e . g . vaccine design 41 , protein cyclisation for enzyme engineering 42 , multivalent and multifunctional protein assembly 43 ) . In this work we use SpyCatcher Δ NC 44 ( a deimmunised SpyCatcher truncation ) and SpyTag002 45 ( an evolved SpyTag with enhanced reaction kinetics ) . Importantly the two pairs react orthogonally ( as do SNAP - tag and Halo - tag ) enabling the specific modular construction of multifunctional beads Bead BG BG BG BG BG BG + + a 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 RL1 - H : : RL1 - H 0 50 100 150 200 250 C oun t Sample Name Median : RL1 - H PG Pos . fcs 195017 PG Negative . fcs 70 . 9 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 BL1 - H : : BL1 - H 0 200 400 600 800 C o u n t Sample Name Median : BL1 - H SpyCatcher Positive . fcs 314286 SpyCatcher Negative . fcs 66 . 0 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 BL1 - H : : BL1 - H 0 50 100 150 C oun t Sample Name Median : BL1 - H YMB Positive Normal Gain . fcs 1063 YMB Neg Normal Gain . fcs 69 . 9 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 BL1 - H : : BL1 - H 0 200 400 600 C oun t Sample Name Median : BL1 - H YMB Positive . fcs 227100 YMB Negative . fcs 7517 b c 200 um 200 um 200 um 200 um d 200 um 200 um 101 102 103 104 BL1 - H : : BL1 - H 0 200 400 600 800 C oun t Sample Name Median : BL1 - H SnpT + . fcs 5652 SnpT - . fcs 71 . 9 101 102 103 104 BL1 - H : : BL1 - H 0 500 1 . 0K 1 . 5K 2 . 0K C oun t Sample Name Median : BL1 - H SnpC + . fcs 10817 SnpC - . fcs 51 . 0 101 102 103 104 BL1 - H : : BL1 - H 0 500 1 . 0K 1 . 5K 2 . 0K C oun t Sample Name Median : BL1 - H SpyT + . fcs 5663 SnpT - . fcs 71 . 9 101 102 103 104 BL1 - H : : BL1 - H 0 100 200 300 400 C oun t Sample Name Median : BL1 - H I19 + . fcs 5222 I19 - . fcs 52 . 0 Cy5 fluorescence Green fluorescence Green fluorescence - SNAP - Protein G + SNAP - Protein G - SNAP - I19 + SNAP - I19 - SNAP - YMB + SNAP - YMB with relative ease . Whilst SpyTag and SnpTag have both been incorporated into hydrogel frameworks previously ( PEG - functionalised 31 , or all - protein hydrogels 46 ) the versatility of these systems is limited compared to that displayed here in which any and all arrangements of protein pairs can be assembled on bead ( Figure 4 b - e ) simply by exchanging the covalent secondary capture module first captured on bead . Due to the orthogonality of the four protein capture technologies employed ( SNAP - tag , Halo - tag , SpyCatcher , SnpCatcher ) , specific capture of target proteins can be programmed by simply functionalising beads + / - any desired component . In Figure 4f we demonstrate the highly controlled capture of GFP - SnpT / mCherry - SpyT based solely upon the previous functionalisation of beads with / without SNAP - SpyCatcher / Halo - SnpCatcher . These beads now exhibit programmed bifunctionality ( both GFP and mCherry fluorescence ) , and serve to demonstrate the versatility , modularity and orthogonality of the PHD technology . As before , researchers can design and express further capture modules and functionalities with relative ease through the use of modular Gibson Assembly .

( f ) Bifunctionalised PHD beads ( 50 µM BG , 50 µM CA , Ø 20 µm ) were incubated + / - SNAP - SpyCatcher and / or Halo - SnpCatcher ) , these beads were subsequently incubated with both GFP - SnpTag and mCherry - SpyTag for 1 hour , washed and analysed by flow cytometry . Application of PHD beads to bioassays : protein - protein interactions , enzymatic catalysis and bacteriolysis Due to the modularity and robustness of the PHD technology it is facile to design and implement bioassays . We demonstrate this for assaying protein : protein interactions – an extremely common bioassay which is key to understanding basic molecular interactions ( e . g . in the development of protein - based therapeutics ) – by carrying out an investigation into the binding kinetics of the SpyCatcher - SpyTag pair ( Figure 5a ) . We incubated SNAP - SpyCatcher functionalised beads with three different concentrations of GFP - SpyTag for up to 60 minutes , before washing away unreacted GFP - SpyTag and measuring the amount of reaction product by flow cytometry – this approach allowed us to readily investigate the effect of GFP - SpyTag concentration on the reaction kinetics . Having demonstrated the utility of PHD beads for assaying protein : protein interactions , we wished to also highlight their suitability for simplifying and improving the quality of high - throughput assays . SNAP - SnpTag was captured directly from bacterial cell lysate and probed by subsequent incubation with GFP - SnpCatcher . A minimal volume of cell lysate corresponding to ~ 2ul of culture volume ( 1 / 500 of the largest volume tested ) was found to already saturate 50 , 000 20 µm , 50 µM BG beads ( Figure S1 . 4 ) . Direct capture of a protein of interest from cell lysate obviates the need for a separate purification step , whilst the precise control over protein capture through user - controlled BG concentration and bead number effectively achieves expression level normalisation for a subsequent assay . Protein expression , lysis , on - bead capture and the subsequent assay ( flow cytometry ) were all carried out in a 96 deep - well plate format ; combining the PHD beads with high - throughput , sensitive techniques such as flow cytometry creates a powerful platform with which multiple parameters ( e . g . affinity and specificity ) can be examined simultaneously , and assays can be multiplexed for even greater throughput 47 . In addition to protein : protein interactions another common form of bioassay is enzymatic catalysis , in which the accumulation of product or loss of substrate is followed over time . The immobilisation of enzymes is of great interest for industrial biocatalysis 2 and can also serve to provide a simple method of delivering a defined concentration of protein to a given assay – an important feature when comparing the activity of enzyme variants in a directed evolution experiment for instance . To demonstrate the precise control of enzyme concentration for use in a subsequent bioassay we captured P91 48 - SpyTag , a phosphotriesterase , on SNAP - SpyCatcher - functionalised beads . The number of beads per reaction was varied , and the accumulation of product followed by an increase in fluorescence signal ( Figure 5b ) . A near - perfect linear relationship is seen between bead number per reaction and catalytic activity , highlighting the compatibility of PHD beads with enzymatic bioassays . In addition , this experiment also highlights the compatibility of PHD beads with the cell - free expression of proteins , as P91 - SpyTag was expressed using PURExpress and directly captured on bead from the in vitro expression reaction . Cell - free expression of proteins is now a well - established field 49 with commercial products available , and can enable the rapid , and ( ultra ) high - throughput expression even of toxic proteins 50 . Next , to demonstrate that our platform’s applications are not limited to cell - free bioassays , we designed a microtitre - plate and flow cytometry compatible sensor for bacteriolysis to facilitate the discovery of antibacterials ( Figure 5c ) . PHD beads were first functionalised with the SNAP - SpyCatcher covalent capture module before being incubated with E . coli which expressed GFP - SpyTag intracellularly and had been exposed to carbenicillin at a range of different concentrations ( 0 - 500 µg / mL ) and under three different conditions : static culture ; culture diluted 1 : 1 in PBS ; and culture resuspended in fresh media ( Figure 5d ) . Bacteriolysis is sensed by the release of GFP - SpyTag from lysed bacteria and its subsequent capture on SNAP - SpyC functionalised PHD beads . These sensor beads can then be recovered and quantitatively analysed by flow cytometry . We observed that resuspension of cells in fresh media was necessary for the maximal induction of bacteriolysis , and we further note that these results implicate carbenicillin ( and / or related molecules ) as an effective protein extraction reagent . Figure 5 PHD beads in designed functional bioassays . ( a ) PHD beads ( 50 µM BG , Ø20 µm ) functionalised with SNAP - SpyCatcher were incubated with three concentrations of GFP - SpyTag , 9 . 55 µM ( cross ) , 1 . 91 µM ( open diamond ) , or 0 . 382 µM ( open circle ) at room temperature with rolling for the indicated times . Beads were recovered , washed , and analysed by flow cytometry . Data is presented normalised to non - functionalised beads , and was acquired in duplicate ( b ) P91 - SpyTag was captured on bead , washed and incubated with 50 µM substrate ( fluoresceine - di ( diethylphosphate ) ) in 100 µl volume . Bead number per well was varied as indicated . The initial 90 minutes of reaction was used to calculate the catalytic activity . Data is presented normalised to non - functionalised beads . ( c ) Overview of bacteriolysis sensor design . PHD beads functionalised with the SNAP - SpyC covalent capture module are incubated with bacterial cells expressing GFP - SpyT . Only upon lysis will the GFP - SpyT be released into solution and be able to be captured on the sensor beads ( d ) E . coli cells expressing GFP - SpyTag were grown overnight with induction of protein expression . Static cultures ( blue ) , cultures resuspended in fresh culture media ( orange ) , and static cultures diluted 1 : 1 with PBS ( grey ) were incubated with a range of carbenicillin concentrations for 90 minutes at 37 o C in triplicate . Cultures were pelleted and the supernatant transferred to incubate with SpyCatcher - functionalised PHD beads for 60 minutes . Beads were washed twice and then analysed by flow cytometry . Valency engineering and photocontrolled release of antibody drugs for phenotypic assays As an extension to the tools already exhibited , we sought to develop a method of releasing captured proteins into solution upon exposure to a specific cue . Ideally this process would be simple , highly controllable and stable , without the requirement for addition of further reagents . Recent advances have enabled the use of genetically encoded photocontrollable elements for micropatterning 24 and control of hydrogel stiffness 51 utilising the photocleavable protein 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 N o r m a li s e d m e d i a n g r ee n f l u o r e s c e n c e ( a . u . x 10 4 ) Time ( minutes ) 9 . 55 µM 1 . 91 µM 0 . 382 µM 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 M e d i a n G r ee n F l u o r e s c e n c e [ Carbenicillin ] ( ug / ml ) Static Resuspension PBS dilution a b Bacteriolysis c R² = 0 . 9994 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 1 . 2 1 . 4 0 5 10 15 20 25 N o r m a li s e d c a t a l y t i c a c t i v i t y ( P r o du c t / s ) Number of beads ( x 10 4 ) d PhoCl 23 . Upon exposure to violet light , PhoCl cleaves its own backbone , thus allowing for the controlled release of attached proteins . Previous attempts to use PhoCl for the controlled release of proteins from hydrogels used click chemistry for immobilisation , which can negatively affect protein functionality through non - site - specific protein capture as well as limiting the engineerability of the system through a lack of orthogonality and easy modularity 24 . As such , we designed and tested a new modular building block , SNAP - PhoCl - SpyCatcher , that would release the SpyCatcher and any associated cargo from the hydrogel ( Figure 6a ) . Cleavage in solution was first verified , with significant cleavage seen after just one minute of exposure to light ( Figure 6b ) . Due to the transparent nature of the PHD beads , we expected photocleavage to retain comparable efficiency when the SNAP - PhoCl - SpyCatcher modular building block is captured on bead . To test this , beads were functionalised with SNAP - PhoCl - SpyCatcher and exposed to 405 nm light . After light exposure ( to prevent any effect of photobleaching ) beads were incubated with mCherry - SpyTag to assay for PhoCl cleavage , and hence loss of the SpyCatcher entity from bead . Greater than 83 % of protein is released after 5 minutes of exposure to 405 nm light ( Figure 6c ) . Improved photocleavage proteins , such as the recently developed PhoCl2 , 52 can be easily incorporated based on the modular design . Many protein : protein interactions rely upon specific valencies of the interacting partners to trigger a specific cellular response 53 , 54 . Engineering the valency state of protein - based therapeutics that are designed to drug such biological systems typically relies upon laborious in - frame cloning and expression , limiting the capacity of a researcher to investigate many different drugs at many different valencies . The SpyCatcher technology has already been demonstrated to facilitate valency engineering through the post - translational assembly of monomeric nanobody - SpyTag into multivalent constructs via capture on SpyCatcher - coiled coil domain fusions 22 . We build upon this work by capturing SpyTag fusion proteins on PHD beads functionalised for valency engineering , thus taking advantage of surface immobilisation for washing and handling , and the subsequent release of assay components ( e . g . in response to a supplied cue of light ) to remove surface effects completely . To this end , we mounted distinct populations of beads with one of six SNAP - PhoCl - SpyCatcher fusion proteins ( SNAP - PhoCl - SpyCatcher 1 - 6 differing in the number of SpyCatcher repeats ) . Subsequent incubation with a monomeric SpyTag fusion protein results in assembly into photoreleasable , tunably multivalent constructs , depending only on the SpyCatcher module used ( Figure 6a ) . An anti - TRAIL - R1 scFv 55 ( 3B04 ) was chosen as a candidate for molecular engineering as related scFv TRAIL - R1 agonists 56 reformatted as IgG had undergone clinical trial , with no clinical benefit seen in either non - small - cell lung cancer 57 or colorectal cancer 58 . TRAIL - R1 is widely considered to signal as a trimer and , in vivo , is agonised by the trimeric TRAIL 59 , and we therefore hypothesised that enhanced potency could be achieved by engineering multivalent versions of the scFv . Similar multivalency engineering approaches have been carried out for nanobodies that target TRAIL - R2 , a highly related receptor also found to be overexpressed on cancer cells , with great success 22 , 60 , but to our knowledge no such investigation has been carried out for scFvs targeting TRAIL - R1 . Initially we investigated the effect of making 3B04 trivalent ( Figure 6d ) , through the incubation of 3B04 - SpyTag with beads functionalised with SNAP - PhoCl - SpyCatcher 3 and the subsequent exposure of half of these beads to 405 nm light . We observed that release of the multivalent assembly from the bead surface is necessary to fully induce apoptosis , presumably due to the sequestration of trivalent scFv assemblies within the volume of the bead , inaccessible to the cell surface receptors . It was straightforward to further engineer the valency state of 3B04 - SpyT through incubation with separate bead populations , each functionalised with one of the six valency engineering modules ( SNAP - PhoCl - SpyCatcher 1 - 6 ) . Subsequent exposure to 405 nm light released each of the fully 3B04 - conjugated valency engineering modules into solution with high purity ( Figure 6e ) . We incubated serial dilutions of each of these constructs ( normalised to the effective scFv concentration ) with HeLa cells for 2 hours and measured apoptosis induction using a fluorogenic caspase - 3 substrate ( NucView 488 ; Figure 6f ) . Decreases in the EC50 values indicate significant increases in potency for all multivalent constructs over monovalent scFv , ( e . g . > 50 - fold for the pentavalent versus monovalent format ; Table 1 ) . Intriguingly , we observe an approximately two - fold reduction in potency when increasing scFv valency from 4x or 5x to 6x . This observation is consistent with previous observations that TRAIL - R1 signalling is dependent not only on trimerisation , but also on co - localisation of numerous TRAIL - R1 trimers within lipid rafts 61 . We speculate that the 4x and 5x constructs may promote trimer formation whilst also forming a lateral ‘bridge’ between consecutive TRAIL - R1 trimers , whereas the 6x construct may only enhance formation of a pair of trimers . Figure 6 : Photocontrolled valency engineering for antibody drug phenotypic assays . ( a ) Beads can be functionalised with the valency engineering covalent capture modules ( SNAP - PhoCl - SpyC 1 - 6 ) and subsequently used to capture SpyT - POI ( here scFv - SpyT ) . Upon exposure to 405 nm light the PhoCl protein self - cleaves and releases the valency - modified assembly into solution .

Beads were then washed and incubated with mCherry - SpyTag followed by flow cytometry .

Cells were then assayed for apoptosis induction by incubation with NucView 488 and subsequent flow cytometry .

Conclusions and Implications An accessible , personalised technology platform for protein immobilisation . In contrast to commercial microbeads ( made of e . g . polystyrene ) , PHD beads have user - definable attachment points and therefore bring customisable orthogonality and control over the valency of protein immobilisation into the hands of the researcher , who can exert this control ‘at home’ – in their ( investigator’s ) laboratory – simply by modifying the concentration of components in the hydrogel synthesis mixture . This : reduces reliance on commercial suppliers ; avoids batch - to - batch variation outside the control of the researcher ; enables a simple method for delivering user - defined amounts of protein to bioassays ; and allows personalised variation of the type of tags used . Furthermore , the simple microfluidic bead synthesis ensures monodispersity at a level of control that is not available for commercial beads , providing flexibility and robustness to bioassays . Attachment points are selective ( allowing e . g . direct scFv valency EC50 ( nM ) 1 114 ± 18 2 15 . 8 ± 1 . 2 3 8 . 21 ± 0 . 26 4 2 . 39 ± 0 . 17 5 1 . 99 ± 0 . 17 6 5 . 88 ± 0 . 52 purification of the protein from a cell lysate ) , which is brought about by covalent tagging – in addition to SNAP - and Halo - tag as used in this study , other tags are available 62 . The site - specific nature of protein capture minimises the potential impact of immobilisation on the activity of the protein of interest , whilst the covalent nature ensures that captured proteins remain stably associated with the hydrogel and do not leach into solution . Surface effects that are frequently encountered when proteins are physically immobilised on plastic surfaces are minimized , and hydrogels can be expected to mimic the natural environment for soluble proteins much better than a hydrophobic surface . The 3D distribution of attachment points throughout the hydrogel volume ( rather than the surface of commercial microbeads ) , enables each bead to be decorated with 150 million protein molecules or more ( ~ 1 . 5 billion for 500 µM BG beads ) in contrast with ~ 660 thousand protein molecules captured on commercial streptavidin beads , Figure SI3b . Finally , hydrogel beads are optically transparent , so that fluorescent measurements are possible and strong signal over background can be detected in all fluorescent channels , while commercial magnetic polystyrene beads exhibit autofluorescence in relevant channels , limiting assay sensitivity 16 . Versatile Assay Formatting . Based on the modular design principles of synthetic biology , PHD beads can be decorated by attaching tagged protein constructs in a generic way , in an effectively “plug and play” solution for biological experiments and engineering . This approach mirrors ‘click chemistry’ 18 by providing universal procedures for attachment that do not have to be adjusted on a case - by - case basis . Direct capture of POIs as SNAP or Halo - tag constructs initially simplifies protein purification directly from cell lysates , and this direct capture can be further augmented by the use of secondary capture modules which enable the expansion of protein capture to endogenous untagged targets ( e . g . IgG ) through the use of defined recombinant affinity reagents . We have developed a suite of these , focussing on bacterially expressible scaffolds to increase accessibility to the technology , and this suite could be readily expanded through the fusion of other affinity reagents ( e . g . DARPins , nanobodies ) to SNAP - or Halo - tag via modular cloning strategies . The use of defined , recombinant affinity reagents at the core of the PHD technology satisfies an urgent need to reduce the use of animal - derived , polyclonal reagents ( as highlighted e . g . in recent EU directives 63 ) . Including secondary covalent capture modules ( e . g . SpyCatcher / SpyTag , SnpCatcher / SnpTag ) adds an extra layer of stable engineerability to the system and enables a second dimension of orthogonality for the creation of multifunctional hydrogels , while the use of valency - engineering modules allows monomeric proteins to be readily assembled into multivalent constructs . Complex multivalent and / or multi - protein decorations are accessible from ( separate or mixed ) solutions of monomers – these decorations are assembled on - bead and render cloning of additional multivalent constructs unnecessary . Multivalency 64 , 65 and induced proximity 66 is a natural mechanism of enhancing and manipulating interactions in biological systems by cooperativity . 67 There are no general rules for the design of multivalent constructs that take advantage of entropic , avidity or co - localisation effects , so the orientation of monomers has to be empirically explored and an experimental format to empirically assess the contribution of multivalency is necessary . This fact is highlighted in our work by the most potent induction of apoptosis being a pentavalent antibody format despite knowledge that the target ( TRAIL - R1 ) is agonised by a trimeric ligand in vivo . Typically , multivalent constructs are cloned and expressed as in - frame fusion proteins , requiring extensive and often practically difficult cloning ( e . g . for sequence - homologous repeats that create PCR problems ) , alongside often expensive and complex mammalian cell expression ( e . g . in the case of IgG ) , limiting both the accessibility of protein engineering and its throughput . However , with PHD beads judicious choice of valency engineering modules can bring about such constructs in multiple permutations simply by incubation instead of cloning , once the monomeric modules are available . Versatility is further boosted by the possibility of photorelease . Steric hindrance and proximity to an ill - defined or hydrophobic surface can limit the applicability of protein assays on beads ( in particular for cell - protein interactions ) , even though the 3D distribution in PHD beads and the solution - like nature of the hydrogel minimise these effects . However , the feature of controlled release of the bead - displayed proteins by optical control removes this common objection against the use of immobilised proteins in assays ( as seen by the release of small molecule compounds in OBOC assays 68 ) . We show that trivalent scFv has to be released from beads in order to potently induce apoptosis . Future applications to take advantage of optical release will include e . g . functional tests with proteins that need to be internalised to target intracellular processes or the control of growth factor presentation for tissue engineering . Further controlled release mechanisms , such as protease sites could be added to modules , enabling for instance the tissue - specific release of sequestered / inactive protein drugs . 69 , 70 Taken together , the versatility of PHD beads allows an unprecedented degree of freedom in the design of bioassay experiments ; straightforward bead - mediated harvesting of proteins from lysates , valency control ( both at the hydrogel decoration stage and for protein constructs ) , orthogonality of the coupling chemistry ( through various tags ) and controlled release constitute a technology suite capable of simplifying the planning and execution of discovery campaigns based on modularity ( Figure 7 ) . We have demonstrated the simple reformatting of beads and proteins for investigating protein : protein interactions , enzymatic catalysis , bacteriolysis and phenotypic assays , but an even wider range of assays and applications is conceivable and take advantage of salient features of PHD beads : biocatalysis , in vivo drug delivery , controlled release , and sensors . Figure 7 . Overview of a modular “build - an - assay” strategy based on PHD beads . Starting from functionalised microbeads ( 1 , see below ) , choices that define the assay format include the desired valency of each single bead as well as the loading of orthogonal protein capture into the system ( controlled by the input concentrations of BG and CA ) . Next , one can choose how to capture a desired protein ( 2 ) : either directly as a SNAP or Halo tag fusion protein , or via secondary capture modules . Secondary capture modules add the capability to specifically capture native or tagged proteins non - covalently , or to specifically and covalently capture proteins bearing tags , e . g . using the SpyTag - SpyCatcher or SnpTag / SnpCatcher technologies . At this stage one can also choose to create multivalent constructs from monomeric input proteins of interest through the use of valency engineering modules . Finally ( 3 ) , the captured proteins can be tested in on - bead assays ( e . g . for their affinity ) , or released from bead in response to irradiation of light , so that the new molecular assemblies can be assayed in solution ( e . g . for phenotypic cellular assays ) . Monodisperse beads can be created in microfluidic devices via water - in - oil emulsions . The design of the microfluidic device and its operation determines the bead size .

As an alternative to the bead format , functionalised hydrogels can also be created on a surface ( e . g . for cell culture ) . EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Protocol for hydrogel bead synthesis and functionalisation ( 1 ) The small molecule anchors ( methacrylate - PEG - benzylguanine / - chloroalkane ; Table S2 . 1 ) for hydrogel functionalisation were synthesised by mixing one volume of 40 mM BG - PEG - NH 2 ( NEB S9150S ) or 40 mM chloroalkane - PEG - NH 2 ( Promega P6741 ) with one volume of 40 mM methacrylate - NHS ( Sigma 730300 ) overnight at room temperature at 400 rpm in the presence of a 1 . 5 - fold molar excess of triethylamine ( Sigma 471283 ) . All solutions were prepared fresh from powder in anhydrous DMSO ( Merck 276855 ) except triethylamine which was added from neat stock . After overnight incubation the reaction was quenched with 3 volumes of 100 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) and rolled 1 hour at room temperature , yielding a final concentration of 5 mM product . ( 2 ) To prepare functionalised beads , unpolymerised hydrogel mix ( 10 mM TrisHCl ( pH 7 . 6 ) , 1 mM EDTA , 15 mM NaCl , 6 . 2 % ( v / v ) acrylamide , 0 . 18 % ( v / v ) bisacrylamide , 0 . 3 % ( w / v ) ammonium persulfate ) containing the small molecule anchors was encapsulated in oil ( 008 - Fluorosurfactant 1 . 35 % w / w , RAN Biotechnologies , TEMED 0 . 4 % v / v in HFE - 7500 ( 3M Novec ) ) in a microfluidic droplet generator ( Figure S2 . 1 ) , as previously described . 27 After encapsulation the emulsion was incubated overnight at 65 °C under mineral oil . The next day , polymerised hydrogel beads were recovered by breaking the emulsion with 800 µL wash buffer ( 100 mM Tris - HCl , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ) , and 200 µL 1H , 1H , 2H , 2H - perfluorooctanol ( PFO , 97 % , Alfa Aesar ) . The tube was inverted several times and briefly centrifuged for 5 seconds at 100 g before recovering the aqueous bead - containing phase into a fresh tube . Large polyacrylamide particles were removed by passing the mixture through a 10 µm filter ( CellTrics ) for 30 seconds at 200 g before using a haemocytometer ( KOVA Glasstic ) to determine the ‘concentration’ of beads in the suspension . These beads are stable at 4 °C for at least one year . For all assays beads are typically incubated and washed in buffer ( 100 mM Tris - HCl , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ) . In other buffers and in unbuffered water , the bead pellet after centrifugation can be difficult to identify . ( 3 ) SNAP - tag / Halo - tag fusion proteins were captured by incubating with a defined number of beads for > 30 minutes with rolling in wash buffer . After protein capture , beads were typically washed 3 times in wash buffer . Subsequent capture of tagged or untagged proteins was performed in the same manner . ( 4 ) On - bead photocleavage was carried out by attaching PCR tubes containing beads to a cooled metal block and exposing to 405 nm light at full power from a LED ( M405L2 Thorlabs ) driven by LEDD1b ( Thorlabs ) .
