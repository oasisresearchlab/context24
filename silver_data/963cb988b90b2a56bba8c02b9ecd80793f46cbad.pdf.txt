Although this human illness has been linked to defective function of the phospha - tidylinositol 5 - phosphatase , Ocrl1 ( Oculo - Cerebro - Renal syndrome of Lowe protein 1 ) , the mechanism by which this enzyme deﬁciency triggers the disease is not clear . Ocrl1 is known to localize mainly to the Golgi apparatus and endosomes , however it translocates to plasma membrane rufﬂes upon cell stimulation with growth factors . The functional implications of this inducible translocation to the plasma membrane are presently unknown . Here we show that Ocrl1 is required for proper cell migration , spreading and ﬂuid - phase uptake in both established cell lines and human dermal ﬁbroblasts . We found that primary ﬁbroblasts from two patients diagnosed with LS displayed defects in these cellular processes . Importantly , these abnormal - ities were suppressed by expressing wild - type Ocrl1 but not by a phosphatase - deﬁcient mutant . Interestingly , the homologous human PI - 5 - phosphatase , Inpp5b , was unable to complement the Ocrl1 - dependent cell migration defect . Further , Ocrl1 variants that cannot bind the endocytic adaptor AP2 or clathrin , like Inpp5b , were less apt to rescue the migration phenotype . However , no defect in membrane recruitment of AP2 / clathrin or in transferrin endocytosis by patient cells was detected . Collectively , our results suggest that Ocrl1 , but not Inpp5b , is involved in rufﬂe - mediated membrane remodeling . Our results provide new elements for understanding how Ocrl1 deﬁciency leads to the abnormalities associated with the LS . INTRODUCTION The Oculo - Cerebro - Renal syndrome of Lowe ( OCRL ) is a recessive , X - linked genetic disease characterized by the pres - ence of congenital cataracts , mental retardation and renal dys - function ( 1 – 3 ) . This disorder is associated with abnormal function of the Inositol 5 - phosphatase ( EC 3 . 1 . 3 . 36 ) Ocrl1 , responsible for the hydrolysis of Phosphatidyl Inositol ( PtdIns ) 5 - phosphates including PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) bi - phosphate ( PIP 2 ) ( 4 – 7 ) , a plasma membrane - enriched phospholipid . Most OCRL1 gene mutations found in Lowe syndrome ( LS ) patients either lead to absence of the gene product or to deﬁcient phosphatase activity ( 4 , 8 ) . Indeed , cells of LS patients frequently possess higher intracellular levels of PIP 2 than do normal cells ( 6 , 9 ) . However , it is still uncertain how this lipid imbalance , or the lack of Ocrl1 , causes the develop - mental abnormalities that characterize the disease . Although Ocrl1 primarily localizes to the Golgi apparatus ( 1 , 10 , 11 ) and early endosomes ( 12 – 15 ) , the pioneering work of Faucherre et al . ( 9 ) demonstrates that this protein also trans - locates to membrane rufﬂes upon stimulation of growth factor receptors . Therefore , we and others ( 9 ) have speculated that this protein might be relevant to processes that require plasma membrane remodeling , such as cell migration . Here we report a novel cellular phenotype associated with LS .

Other processes requiring extensive membrane remodeling , such as cell spreading and ﬂuid - phase uptake , are also affected in LS cells . These defects are speciﬁc for a lack of Ocrl1 function and they cannot be rescued by expression of the homologous phosphatase Inpp5b . We speculate that these novel phenotypes would have con - sequences on aspects of embryo development and cell physi - ology contributing to LS pathology . RESULTS Ocrl1 localizes to plasma membrane rufﬂes of migrating cells Faucherre et al . ( 9 ) demonstrated that upon stimulation with growth factors , Ocrl1 localizes to plasma membrane rufﬂes in COS - 7 cells ; therefore , we hypothesized that this protein plays a role in cellular processes that require plasma mem - brane remodeling , such as cell migration . Indeed , we observed that in addition to Golgi localization , migrating HeLa and HT1080 human cells and NIH3T3 murine ﬁbroblasts accumu - lated GFP - Ocrl1 in membrane rufﬂes ( Fig . 1 ) . Time - lapse microscopy indicated that GFP - Ocrl1 was dyna - mically recruited to the leading edge of migrating cells ( Sup - plementary Material , Movie S1 and Fig . S1 ) . We also observed dynamic puncta and tubular structures ( Supplemen - tary Material , Movies S1 and S2 ) previously noted by other investigators ( 14 ) . Moreover , circular structures decorated with GFP - Ocrl1 appeared to be assembled in rufﬂes and moved towards the cell central region ( Supplementary Material , Movies S1 and S2 , and Fig . S1 ) . Since these struc - tures also contained clathrin ( that partially co - localized with Ocrl1—Supplementary Material , Fig . S1 ) , we speculated that they might be endocytic in nature . In fact , clathrin is a known Ocrl1 - interaction partner ( 13 , 14 ) . Ocrl1 function is required for proper cell migration Since Ocrl1 was enriched in membrane rufﬂes at the leading edge of migrating cells ( Fig . 1 ) , we tested whether Ocrl1 plays an active role in cell migration . Therefore , the ability of Ocrl1 knock - down cells to migrate through transwell ﬁlters was examined ( Fig . 2A and B ) . Knocking down Ocrl1 expression signiﬁcantly impaired migration of human HeLa and mouse NIH3T3 cells relative to control cells ( Fig . 2C and D ) . Importantly , this phenotype was speciﬁcally linked to Ocrl1 - deﬁciency as it was rescued by expression of a siRNA - resistant GFP - Ocrl1 construct ( Fig . 2D ) . LS cells are deﬁcient for cell migration We reasoned that if Ocrl1 is required for proper cell migration , then cells from LS patients should also display defects in this process . We ﬁrst characterized ﬁbroblasts from two different patients diagnosed with Lowe syndrome : LS1 and LS2 . Western blotting with speciﬁc antibodies indicated that these ﬁbroblasts did not express detectable levels of Ocrl1 but dis - played signiﬁcant amounts of the homologous phosphatase Inpp5b ( Fig . 3A ) . Next , we assessed migration of LS and control cells using the transwell assay . We transfected LS and normal ﬁbroblast with GFP , GFP - Ocrl1 WT or GFP - Ocrl1 H507R and assayed the resulting transfectants for migration in transwells . Figure 3B reveals that both LS cell migrated less than normal cells in a transwell assay . Moreover , the defect in migration of LS cells was rescued by expression of WT human Ocrl1 - GFP ( Fig . 3B ) . However , expression of a phosphatase - deﬁcient Ocrl1 variant ( Ocrl1 H507R ) identiﬁed in another LS patient ( 16 ) was unable to rescue the defect in migration of LS cells ( Fig . 3B ) . These data support the idea that genetic lesions leading to LS , either by causing absence of Ocrl1 expression ( LS1 and LS2 ; Fig . 3A ) or inactivation of its phos - phatase activity ( Ocrl1 H507R ; Fig . 3B ) , affect patients’ cells ability to migrate . Levels of expression of all GFP - fusion con - structs were comparable ( Supplementary Material , Fig . S2 ) . Further , these results were conﬁrmed using a ‘wound - healing’ migration assay ( Fig . 4 ) . LS cells exhibited a signiﬁ - cantly lower extent of migration towards a newly generated cell - free space than did normal ﬁbroblasts ( Fig . 4A and B ) . LS cell migration defect does not involve Golgi polarization abnormalities and it is independent of the nature of the migration stimuli Since Ocrl1 mainly localizes at the Golgi apparatus ( 1 , 10 , 11 ) and this organelle is oriented towards the leading edge during cell migration ( 17 ) , we tested whether reduced Ocrl1 expression is associated with abnormalities in the polarization of the Golgi apparatus . ‘Wound - healing’ assays on LS versus normal cells were performed , followed by ﬁxation and stain - ing of nuclei and Golgi apparatus . The extent of polarization of the Golgi apparatus during migration was assessed by deter - mination of Q , the angle between the nucleus - Golgi and the nucleus - leading edge axes ( Fig . 4C ) . Migrating LS and control cells were stained with DAPI , rhodamine – phalloidin and by immunoﬂuorescence using an antibody against the trans - Golgi network resident protein TGN46 ( Fig . 4D ) . Our results revealed that the polarity of the Golgi apparatus was not signiﬁcantly altered in LS cells ( Fig . 4D and E ) . We next asked whether the deﬁcit in migration displayed by the LS cells involved changes in the response to haptotactic and / or chemotatic stimuli . Since different motility modes rely on different subsets of cell surface and signaling mol - ecules ( 18 , 19 ) , these experiments had the potential to provide information about speciﬁc signaling pathways affected in LS cells . We used modiﬁed versions of the trans - well migration assay to compare the responses of LS and normal cells to hapto and chemotactic stimuli ( Fig . 5 ) . LS cells displayed abnormal responses to both types of stimuli ( Fig . 5 ) . These results suggested that the deﬁciency in Ocrl1 activity in LS cells caused basic cell migration defects that did not depend on speciﬁc sensing / signaling mechanisms . Cell migration defects of LS ﬁbroblasts cannot be rescued by transfection of the Ocrl1 – homologous phosphatase Inpp5b Ocrl1 and the homologous phosphatase Inpp5b show common domain composition ( 20 ) , share interaction partners Human Molecular Genetics , 2009 , Vol . 18 , No . 23 4479 D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / h m g / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 18 / 23 / 4478 / 664093 b y gue s t on 16 J anua r y 2019 ( 11 , 12 , 15 , 20 , 21 ) and exhibit functional overlap ( 22 ) . In fact , although Ocrl1 knock - out mice do not display typical symptoms of LS ( 22 ) , the double Ocrl1 / Inpp5b knock - out results in embryonic lethality ( 22 ) . These ﬁndings clearly indicate an essential functional redundancy between these two enzymes . Fibroblasts from LS1 and LS2 patients expressed similar levels of Inpp5b compared with control cells ( Fig . 3A ) . Yet , LS cells displayed Ocrl1 - dependent deﬁciencies in cell migration ( Fig . 3B ) . Thus , we postulated that either : ( i ) the endogenous Inpp5b expression in LS cells is inadequate to sustain cell migration in the absence of Ocrl1 ; or that ( ii ) Inpp5b cannot fulﬁll the role of Ocrl1 in cell migration . If the ﬁrst hypothesis is valid then supplementing the endogen - ous levels by transfecting human Inpp5b constructs should rescue the defect in cell migration exhibited by LS cells . If alternative ( ii ) is true , then exogenous Inpp5b should not rescue the defect in migration exhibited by the LS cells . Expression of GFP - Ocrl1 rescued the deﬁciency in cell migration displayed by the LS cells . In contrast , expression of GFP - Inpp5b did not rescue this defect ( Fig . 6A ) . Similar results were obtained when using a Flag - tagged version of Inpp5b ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the inability of GFP - Inpp5b to rescue the migration deﬁcit displayed by LS cells was not due to interference of Inpp5b function by the Figure 1 . Ocrl1 localizes to membrane rufﬂes of migrating cells . HT1080 and HeLa cells expressing GFP - Ocrl1 were serum - starved ( 0 . 1 % FBS ) for at least 8 h , stimulated with 10 % FBS for 15 min , ﬁxed and imaged .

Levels of expression of the GFP - fusions were comparable ( Supplementary Material , Fig . S2 ) . Finally , knocking down expression of Inpp5b with speciﬁc siRNAs did not affect the migration of HeLa cells in transwells ( Fig . 6B ) . Taken together , these results strongly suggest that the functional overlap between Ocrl1 and Inpp5b does not extend to cell migration . The ability of Ocrl1 to efﬁciently localize to membrane rufﬂes and to sustain cell migration requires Ocrl1 - speciﬁc clathrin - and AP2 - binding determinants Ocrl1and Inpp5b display signiﬁcant sequence homology and equivalent domain composition ( Fig . 7A ) , yet only Ocrl1 rescued the defect in migration displayed by LS cells ( Fig . 6A ) . Therefore , we reasoned that the limited regions of dissimilarity between Ocrl1 and Inpp5b should be responsible for their differential ability to sustain ﬁbroblast migration . As shown in Figure 7A , the differences between these proteins are concentrated near the amino terminus , where a PH domain has been recently described ( 23 ) . This region of Ocrl1 contains only a few recognizable sequence motifs , including putative binding sites for the endocytic proteins clathrin and AP2 ( 11 , 13 , 14 ) . A second putative clathrin - binding motif is found just preceding the inactive RhoGAP domain of Ocrl1 ( 13 ) ( Fig . 7A ) . Furthermore , partial co - localization of Ocrl1 with clathrin and AP2 has been reported ( 11 – 14 ) and we have con - ﬁrmed and extended these observations to membrane rufﬂes ( Supplementary Material , Movie S2 and Fig . S1 ) . Thus , we deleted the Clathrin - Binding and AP2 - Binding Motifs ( CBM and ABM , respectively ; Fig . 7A ) of Ocrl1 and tested whether these mutated proteins rescued the defect in cell migration displayed by LS ﬁbroblasts . Results shown in Figure 7B indicate that deletion of the CBM and ABM motifs of Ocrl1 disrupted the ability of Ocrl1 to rescue the defect in cell migration displayed by LS ﬁbroblasts . Figure 4 .

However , it is known that both cla - thrin and AP2 are ‘hubs’ in the protein – protein interaction network involved in endocytosis ; in other words , they bind and are recognized by most endocytic proteins ( 28 ) . Therefore , it is unlikely that lack of Ocrl1 would lead to a signiﬁcant defect in clathrin and AP2 recruitment to endocytic sites that would explain the observed migration abnormalities . ( ii ) It is also possible that binding to AP2 and clathrin is important for Ocrl1 recruitment to speciﬁc sites within mem - branes . Once in place , Ocrl1 would function either by exerting its phosphatase activity ( contributing to endocytic site dynamics ) or via a yet - to - be - established mechanism . The ﬁrst hypothesis predicts that in LS cells , clathrin / AP2 structures will be absent or at least abnormal , thereby leading to defects in endocytosis . It is also possible that Figure 5 . Dermal ﬁbroblast from LS patients show cell migration defects independent of the nature of the migration stimuli . Normal and patient ﬁbroblasts were allowed to migrate towards a gradient of ﬁbronectin ( FBN - Haptotaxis ) or serum ( Chemotaxis ) and in the absence of gradient or stimulation .

The second hypothesis predicts that mutated versions of Ocrl1 lacking clathrin - and / or AP2 - binding motifs would fail to localize to appropriate , speciﬁc subcellular regions . We evaluated these two hypotheses by ﬁrst comparing the status of the AP2 / clathrin - positive structures in LS versus normal cells . Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy revealed that LS cells displayed clathrin and AP2 localization indistin - guishable from normal controls ( Supplementary Material , Fig . S3A ; data not shown ) . Indeed , and in agreement with previous reports ( 29 ) , migrating LS cells exhibited polarized clathrin and AP2 distribution at the leading edge . Since transferrin ( Tf ) receptor is internalized exclusively via an AP2 - and clathrin - dependent mechanism ( 30 , 31 ) , we ana - lyzed the uptake of FITC - tagged transferrin ( FITC - Tf ) by LS and normal cells . The results indicate that internalization of FITC - Tf proceeded in a very similar manner in LS and control cells ( Supplementary Material , Fig . S3B and C ) . We also found no difference between LS and controls cells for the uptake of epidermal growth factor labeled with tetramethylrhodamine or 125 I ( data not shown ) . There - fore , our results do not support a major role for Ocrl1 in the recruitment of clathrin / AP2 or in receptor internalization . Further , we also found no signiﬁcant difference between normal and LS cells for b 1 - integrin internalization ( data not shown ) . Since Ocrl1 did not seem to be required for AP2 or clathrin function , we tested our second mechanistic hypothesis ; i . e . if the interaction with these endocytic proteins was required for the correct subcellular localization of Ocrl1 . It has been clearly established that Inpp5b and Ocrl1 differ in their intra - cellular distribution ( 32 ) . Inpp5b is enriched in the ER / cis - Golgi transition region , whereas Ocrl1 accumulates in the trans - Golgi / endosome / plasma membrane compartments ( 32 ) . Further , we established that although both GFP - Ocrl1 and GFP - Inpp5b showed broad and partially overlapping intra - cellular distributions , GFP - Ocrl1 exhibited greater accumu - lation in membrane rufﬂes than GFP - Inpp5b ( Fig . 8A ) . Although it is known that multiple determinants participate in Ocrl1 localization ( including the RhoGAP domain and Rab - binding sites ; 9 , 15 ) , we speculated that clathrin and AP2 binding somehow contributes to Ocrl1 localization to rufﬂes . In fact , several proteins associated with clathrin - dependent pathways localize to membrane rufﬂes ( 33 – 38 ) and both AP2 and clathrin are present in these membrane structures ( data not shown ; Supplementary Material , Fig . S3A ) . We ana - lyzed the ability of different GFP - Ocrl1 constructs to translo - cate to membrane rufﬂes in serum - stimulated HT1080 cells ( Fig . 8B ) . Although all GFP - Ocrl1 versions ( and also GFP - Inpp5b ) showed a certain extent of rufﬂe localization , Figure 7 .

In agreement with a previous report ( 11 ) , all Ocrl1 mutants displayed Golgi localization similar to WT Ocrl1 ( Fig . 8B ) . Further , Ocrl1 H507R , which is deﬁcient in phosphatase activity , appears to exhibit a fragmented pattern of Golgi localization . This observation agrees with those made using an Ocrl1 trun - cation that lacks the phosphatase domain ( 13 ) . We also noted that in addition to its Golgi - localization , Ocrl1 D ABM displayed a broad , uniform plasma membrane distribution , as evidenced by its ability to mask nuclear visualization ( Fig . 8B ) . This latter observation further supports our idea that binding to AP2 contributes to Ocrl1 localization at speciﬁc plasma mem - brane sites . We speculate that the Ocrl1 mutated proteins dis - played a decrease in rufﬂe localization at the expense of enhanced Golgi / puncta ( Ocrl1 H507R and Ocrl1 D CBM ) or hom - ogenous plasma membrane ( Ocrl1 D ABM ) distributions . These data support the hypothesis that clathrin and AP2 binding con - tribute to localization of Ocrl1 at membrane rufﬂes by a still - to - be - established mechanism perhaps shared with other clathrin - associated proteins ( 32 – 37 ) . Levels of expression of all GFP - fusion constructs were comparable ( Supplementary Material , Fig . S2 ) . Ocrl1 also plays a role in cell spreading and ﬂuid - phase uptake by human ﬁbroblasts We asked whether other membrane - intensive processes such as cell spreading ( 39 ) and ﬂuid - phase uptake ( 40 ) , are affected in LS cells . Therefore , the ability of freshly lifted cells to adhere and spread on ﬁbronectin - coated surfaces was tested . Our results indicate that LS cells spread less than their normal counterparts ( Fig . 9A ) . Moreover , LS cell populations were abundant in irregularly spread cells and enriched in early - spreading intermediates featuring actin - based microspikes ( 41 ) ( Fig . 9B ) . Membrane remodeling is also required for pinocytosis and ﬂuid - phase uptake of extracellular material by cells ( 27 , 40 ) . Although this process does not require clathrin , clathrin - associated and rufﬂe - localized proteins such as Dynamin - 2 play a role in pinocytosis / ﬂuid phase uptake ( 27 ) . Therefore , we hypothesized that a deﬁciency in Ocrl1 could affect this process . Indeed , Figure 10A and B indicates that the uptake of TMR - labeled 70 kDa dextran was impaired in LS cells . Furthermore , knocking down Ocrl1 , but not Inpp5b , in HeLa cells also decreased dextran uptake ( Fig . 10B and C ) . Finally , we visualized GFP - Ocrl1 recruited to macropinosomal - derived structures ﬁlled with dextran ( Supplementary Material , Fig . S4 ) , supporting a role for Ocrl1 in ﬂuid phase uptake . DISCUSSION This study reports the ﬁrst LS cellular phenotype that is linked to the deﬁciency of Ocrl1 expression but independent of the functional status of the homologous phosphatase Inpp5b . Speciﬁcally , we found that ﬁbroblasts from LS patients ( which are deﬁcient for Ocrl1 function ) display abnormal cell migration , cell spreading and ﬂuid - phase uptake . There - fore , and based on other investigators’ and our own results , we propose that Ocrl1 displays functions that are ( i ) shared Figure 8 .

Moreover , given the relevance of the pro - cesses involved we expect that deﬁciencies in Ocrl1 - specifc functions will affect aspects of normal development and cell physiology . Here we used different cell biological approaches to test the hypothesis that Ocrl1 is involved in cellular processes that rely on plasma membrane remodeling such as cell migration , spreading and ﬂuid - phase uptake . Our results indicate that ﬁbroblasts from LS1 and LS2 patients and wild - type cells depleted of Ocrl1 are impaired for cell migration . This phenotype can be rescued by expression of Ocrl1 WT ( isoforms a and b ) , but not by introduc - tion of a phosphatase - deﬁcient version of Ocrl1 ( Ocrl1 H507R ) found in another LS patient ( 16 ) ( Figs 2 , 3 and 7 ) . We observed that LS1 and LS2 ﬁbroblasts were impaired for cell migration even when they expressed signiﬁcant levels of Inpp5b ( Fig . 2A ) . Moreover , transfection of LS ﬁbro - blast with GFP - Inpp5b or Flag - Inpp5b did not rescue the defect in migration ( Fig . 6A ) . Finally , knock - down of Ocrl1 , but not of Inpp5b , reproduced the LS migration defect in HeLa cells ( Fig . 6B ) . As a whole , our results indicate that the functional redundancy between Ocrl1 and Inpp5b does not extend to the role in cell migration of the former . How does lack of Ocrl1 affect cell migration ? Ocrl1 is involved in vesicle trafﬁcking ( 11 – 15 , 20 ) . In fact , available evidence indicates that Ocrl1 is recruited to vesicu - lar / tubular carriers that also contain cargo and clathrin ( 14 ; Supplementary Material , Movie S2 and Fig . S1 ) . Since Ocrl1 binds key elements of the endocytosis machinery such as Rab GTPases , the AP2 and APPL1 adaptors and clathrin ( 11 – 15 , 20 , 21 , 42 ) , Ocrl1 is predicted to play a role within the endocytic pathway . Our results suggest that lack of Ocrl1 does not affect receptor internalization ( Supplementary Material , Fig . S3B ) , but do not rule out a post - internalization role by association with critical endosomal proteins like Rab5 and Appl1 ( 12 , 42 ) . Whether these interactions play a role in cell migration / spreading / ﬂuid - phase uptake remains to be elu - cidated and constitute the object of intense research in our laboratory . Despite the abundant localization of Ocrl1 to the Golgi apparatus , we did not ﬁnd evidence that LS cells exhibit major defects in Golgi apparatus polarization during cell migration . Instead , we observed that LS cells exhibit defects in other membrane rufﬂe - dependent processes , such as cell spreading and ﬂuid - phase uptake ( Figs 9 and 10 ) . Further , our data support a role for the clathrin - and AP2 - binding sites for Ocrl1 ability to sustain cell migration . However , we cannot ensure whether the AP2 / clathrin binding requirement for Ocrl1 function obeys to a direct or indirect ( e . g . by enhan - cing general Ocrl1 membrane recruitment ) mechanism . Although the mechanism by which the Ocrl1 interaction with clathrin / AP2 may contribute to rufﬂe function is unknown , several lines of evidence connect clathrin - dependent pathways with rufﬂe - related processes . 1 . Many proteins involved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis display functions in rufﬂe - mediated membrane remodeling . Ocrl1 seems to be another member of a group of proteins ( including amphiphysin1 , SNX9 , dynamin and myosin VI ( 33 , 35 , 36 , 43 ) that associate with clathrin structures and at the same time have membrane rufﬂe - dependent functions . It is not clear how proteins that display clathrin - related functions participate in membrane remodeling processes . However , it is interesting to note that , in addition to AP2 and clathrin , Ocrl1 can interact with the rufﬂe formation - stimulating factors ARF6 ( 44 ) and Rac1 ( 45 ) . Further , Ocrl1 - deﬁcient cells display abnormalities in the actin cytoskeleton ( 46 ) , which in turn is central to rufﬂe formation . 2 . Interdependence between rufﬂe - mediated and clathrin - dependent pathways . Our manuscript shows evidence that ﬂuid - phase uptake is affected in Ocrl1 - deﬁcient cells ( Fig . 10 ) . Precedents found in the literature support the cross - talk between macropinocytosis / ﬂuid phase uptake and clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( 47 ) . For example , it is known that following macropinocytosis , there is a clathrin - dependent retrieval of cargo ( 48 ) . In fact , we have also visualized Ocrl1 associated with macropinocytic structures ( Supplementary Material , Fig . S3 ) . 3 . Spatial coordination between clathrin and membrane remodeling pathways . AP2 and clathrin have been observed polarized towards the rufﬂe - rich leading edge of migratory cells ( 29 ; Supplementary Material , Fig . S3 ) . Likewise other regulatory / signaling proteins involved in rufﬂe dynamics , such as p600 , are also found associated with clathrin and actin in regions of membrane extension ( 49 ) . Furthermore , ARF6 is capable of both stimulating clathrin / AP2 membrane recruitment ( 50 , 51 ) and inducing rufﬂe formation ( 52 ) . Finally , regions rich in the Ocrl1 substrate PIP 2 are known organizing centers for both endocytosis and membrane ruf - ﬂing ( 53 ) . Therefore , although mechanistic details are unclear , data from multiple laboratories suggest that clathrin - dependent pathways and membrane remodeling processes can function - ally intersect . Our data provide another example by showing that clathrin - and AP2 - binding sites are required for Ocrl1 - speciﬁc functions . Why is the phosphatase activity of Ocrl1 required for cell migration ? The rufﬂed leading edge of migrating cells is a highly dynamic structure that depends on constant actin cytoskeleton rearrangements driven by the Rho GTPase Rac1 ( 54 , 55 ) . Inter - estingly , PIP 2 is enriched in rufﬂes and is crucial for regulation of actin binding proteins ( 53 , 56 ) and possibly Rac1 recruit - ment to the plasma membrane ( 57 ) . Therefore , we believe that inositol phosphatases are key for the dynamic regulation of phospholipid levels . In fact , altera - tion of this PtdIns cycling by kinase overexpression ( 58 ) or by phosphatase deﬁciency ( this work ) interferes with cell migration . A similar effect was observed upon acute PIP 2 depletion ( 59 ) , further reinforcing the relevance of PtdIns cycling . Since Ocrl1 is proposed to hydrolyze this lipid at membrane rufﬂes ( 9 ) , we speculate that LS cells would exhibit deﬁciencies in their ability to promote the PIP 2 turnover necessary for leading edge dynamics .

A conceptual breakthrough of LS pathology comes from the realization that target organs , such as brain and kidney , show low expression levels of Inpp5b ( 22 ) . Thereby , in LS patients , deﬁciencies in Ocrl1 functions which are redundant with Inpp5b predict speciﬁc phenotypes associated with these organs ( 22 ) . Our ﬁndings indicate that there are also some Ocrl1 func - tions that cannot be fulﬁlled by Inpp5b . These include the role played by Ocrl1 in processes dependent on membrane remodeling such as cell migration , spreading and ﬂuid - phase uptake . The extent by which Ocrl1 functions will contribute to the clinical / phenotypic manifestations of Lowe Syndrome will depend on multiple variables and it is difﬁcult to predict . These variables include the nature of the Ocrl1 mutation ( trun - cation , functional hypomorph or no protein at all ) , genetic modiﬁers and genetic background , cell type , and tissue or extracellular matrix ( ECM ) properties ( 60 ) . In fact , cell migration and spreading are dramatically affected by the nature of the ECM and their importance varies depending on the cell type ( 61 – 63 ) . Therefore , it is expected that upon Ocrl1 deﬁciency , some cell types in some organs or tissues will be more susceptible to display abnormalities in one versus another process ( e . g . cell migration versus ﬂuid - phase uptake phenotypes ) . Nonetheless , we expect that the dramatic phenotypes dis - played by LS cells will affect aspects of normal development and cell physiology . Hence , we believe that the ﬁndings reported in this work will contribute to reﬁne the theoretical framework for understanding the molecular basis of LS and for shaping therapeutic efforts against this disease . MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents DAPI , Rhodamine - Phalloidin , FITC - transferrin and TMR - dextran were obtained from Invitrogen / Molecular probes . Other materials were purchased from Fisher Scientiﬁc ( Fairlawn , NJ , USA ) or Sigma ( St Louis , MO , USA ) unless noted otherwise . Plasmids and antibodies The following DNA constructions have been described pre - viously : Ocrl1 - GFP ( 14 ) , Inpp5b - GFP , Flag - Inpp5b ( 32 ) . mCherry - Clathrin light chain was a kind gift from M . Szczodrak and K . Rottner ( Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research ) . Ocrl1 site - directed mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange kit ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA , USA ) . Preparation of sheep afﬁnity puriﬁed antibodies against human Ocrl1 and rabbit afﬁnity puriﬁed antibodies against human Inpp5b have been described previously ( 13 , 32 ) . Other antibodies were obtained from commercial sources : mouse monoclonal anti - clathrin heavy chain X - 22 ( Afﬁnity BioReagents ) , rabbit polyclonal anti - TGN46 ( AbD ) , rabbit polyclonal anti - GFP ( G1544 , Sigma ) and mouse monoclonal anti - a - tubulin DM1A ( abcam ) . Cells and cell culture Normal and LS primary dermal ﬁbroblasts ( GM07492 , GM 01676 and GM 03265 ) were obtained from the NIHGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository ( Coriell Institute for Medical Research , Camden , NJ , USA ) . HT1080 , HeLa and NIH3T3 cell lines were acquired from ATCC . Cells were cul - tured in DMEM , Streptomycin / Penicillin , 2 m M L - Glutamine and 15 % ( primary cells ) or 10 % ( HT1080 and HeLa ) fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , or 10 % calf serum ( NIH3T3 ) . For exper - iments involving ﬁbronectin - coated surfaces , bovine plasma ﬁbronectin ( Biomedical Technologies ) was diluted in PBS and incubated on surfaces for 2 h at 37 8 C , washed twice with PBS and used . Cell transfections siRNA transfections . HeLa or NIH3T3 were seeded in 4 cm 2 cell culture plates and grown to 70 % density in 24 h . Media was then exchanged for DMEM without serum and antibiotics 1 h before transfection . Cells were incubated 4 h with 4 m l Lipofectamine RNAiMax ( Invitrogen ) complexed with 40 pmoles of siRNA control ( scrambled RNA , Santa Cruz : sc - 37007 ) , against Ocrl1 ( Santa Cruz : sc - 39073 for human and sc - 39074 for mouse ) or against human Inpp5b ( M - 021811 , Dharmacon ) . The procedure was repeated twice , at 72 and 60 h before use . Complete media was added after 4 h each transfection . siRNA / plasmid co - transfections . Cells prepared as above were incubated with 4 m l of DharmaFECT Duo ( Dharmacon ) com - plexed with 1 m g of plasmid DNA and 40 pmoles of siRNA . After 4 h , transfection media was replaced by complete media and cells were used 60 – 72 h later . In all cases , we determined the viability of the knock - down with respect to the control cells by using a MTT assay ( BioAs - say Systems ) ( control : 100 % ; Ocrl1 knock - down : 98 % and Inpp5b knock - down : 93 % ) . The percentage of apoptotic and necrotic cells ( apoptotic (cid:3) 0 . 5 % ; necrotic (cid:3) 2 . 0 % ) for all samples was also assessed using an Annexin - V - Fluos staining kit ( Roche ) . Plasmid transfections . HeLa , HT1080 and NIH3T3 cells were transfected by using Trans IT - LT1 ( Mirus ) according to man - ufacturer’s instructions . Transfection of primary ﬁbroblasts was achieved by electroporation as follows : approximately 1 (cid:4) 10 6 cells from a subconﬂuent culture were trypsinized , washed with PBS and resuspended in 400 m l of ice - cold elec - troporation buffer ( 12 m M Hepes , 200 m M sucrose , 5 m M MgCl 2 , 5 m M KH 2 PO 4 , 2 m M EDTA , 1 % DMSO ) . Cell sus - pension was mixed with approximately 30 m g of plasmid DNA and transferred to a pre - chilled 0 . 2 cm electroporation cuvette and maintained at 4 8 C for 10 min . Cells were gently resuspended , pulsed at 400 V in a BioRad Gene Pulser and let rest on ice for 10 min . Cells were warmed up to 37 8 C and plated in complete media . Transfected cells were normally used 18 – 24 h after transfection . 4488 Human Molecular Genetics , 2009 , Vol . 18 , No . 23 D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / h m g / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 18 / 23 / 4478 / 664093 b y gue s t on 16 J anua r y 2019 SDS / PAGE and immunoblotting Cell lysates in Laemmli’s protein sample buffer were separ - ated on 15 - well 4 – 20 % gradient gels ( Pierce ) at 20 mA con - stant current in SDS / PAGE running buffer ( 100 m M Tris base , 100 m M Hepes , 0 . 1 % SDS ) and transferred onto nitrocel - lulose membrane in transfer buffer ( 48 m M Tris , 1 m M SDS , 400 m M glycine , 10 % methanol ) at 80 V for 90 min . Blots were blocked 1 h at room temperature in TBST - milk ( 25 m M Tris , 150 m M NaCl , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 , pH ¼ 7 . 5 , 5 % non - fat dried milk ) and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody and dilution ( anti - Ocrl1 : 1 : 200 ; anti - Inpp5b : 1 : 500 ; anti - tubulin : 1 : 1000 ) overnight at 4 8 C or for 1 h at room temperature ( anti - tubulin ) . After incubation with a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature and washing , speciﬁc bands were detected by chemiluminescence using SuperSignal West Femto ( Pierce ) as a substrate and visualized using a Alpha - Innotech imaging system ( San Leandro , CA , USA ) . Densitometric analysis was carried out by using the corresponding tools from the imaging system software . Cell staining and microscopy In all cases , stained cells were imaged in a Zeiss Axiovert - 200M microscope equipped with temperature - controlled , motorized stage for optical z - sectioning . Immunoﬂuorescence . Fixed cells were processed for immuno - ﬂuorescence by incubating with primary antibodies in com - plete media containing 0 . 1 % saponin for 60 min at room temperature . After washing with PBS , cells were incubated with secondary antibodies in media supplemented with saponin for 45 min . Coverslips were washed with PBS and mounted on slides using Aqua - PolyMount ( Polysciences ) and imaged . DAPI and Rhodamine – phalloidin staining . DAPI stain was diluted to 1 / 20 000 in PBS and cells were stained for 20 min at room temperature . Rhodamine – phalloidin staining was conducted by incubating the cells with 30 nM rhodamine – phalloidin in media with 0 . 1 % saponin for 45 min at room temperature . Rufﬂing assays . Transfected HeLa and HT1080 cells grown on coverslips were incubated with starvation media ( DMEM sup - plemented with 0 . 1 % FBS ) for 8 – 12 h followed by stimu - lation with 10 % FBS for 15 min . Cells were then washed , ﬁxed and the coverslips mounted on slides . The procedure for Rufﬂing Index ( RI ) determination was adapted from Cox et al . ( 64 ) to analyze migrating and spreading cells where rufﬂes are mostly located at the cell periphery . Brieﬂy , more than 100 transfectants were randomly imaged at 40 (cid:4) magni - ﬁcation and the percentage of the cell perimeter that was deco - rated with rufﬂes containing GFP - fusion protein was determined . Cells were then individually scored using a scale of 0 – 3 , where 0 , no GFP - positive rufﬂes present , 1 , 25 % , 2 , 50 % and 3 , (cid:5) 75 % of cell perimeter covered with GFP - positive rufﬂes . A rufﬂing index was estimated as the sum of rufﬂing scores divided by the total number of cells scored . Time - lapse microscopy . Cells were resuspended by trypsiniza - tion and allowed to recover in suspension for 1 h . Cells were then seeded in Lab - TekII # 1 . 5 imaging chambers ( Nalge Nunc ) which were coated with ﬁbronectin . Immediately before imaging , media was replaced with PBS containing appropriate amounts of serum and the chamber sealed and transferred to the temperature - controlled stage . Images were captured at 10 or 15 second intervals as indicated within 30 min after exchanging media for PBS . Cell migration assays Transwell cell migration assays . In the assay , 10 4 cells were trypsinized and trypsin quenched with complete media . Cells were then resuspended in 500 m l media containing 0 . 5 % BSA and lacking FBS and allowed to recover in suspension for 1 h . Then cells were applied on 0 . 33 cm 2 , 8 m m pore trans - well inserts ( Corning Inc ) coated with 100 m g / ml BSA and 10 m g / ml ﬁbronectin on the upper and bottom side of the insert membrane , respectively . Inserts were placed in wells containing media with 15 % FBS and allowed to migrate for 6 h and ﬁxed in 3 % formaldehyde for 10 min . For cell migration experiments using established cell lines , migration times were modiﬁed to adapt to the higher migration rates of these cells ( HeLa : 3 h ; NIH3T3 : 4 h ) . Cells on ﬁxed mem - branes were stained with DAPI and visualized by epiﬂuores - cence microscopy . Total nuclei or transfected cells were counted per membrane in order to obtain cell inputs , then the upper side of the membrane was swabbed with a q - tip and rinsed with PBS . Cells on the bottom side of the mem - brane were visualized and scored as migrants if their nuclei passed through the membrane pores . Similar amounts of each type ( control and Ocrl1 - or Inpp5b - knock - down ) were used in parallel assays . Migration results were normalized based on input values and expressed as the mean + SD of tri - plicate membranes . ‘Wound - healing’ migration assays . A straight piece of a cov - erslip and a four - chamber Lab - TekII # 1 . 5 imaging chamber ( Nalge Nunc ) were coated with 25 m g / ml ﬁbronectin . Approximately 1 (cid:4) 10 6 cells were trypsinized and the volume of cell suspension adjusted to 1 . 5 ml with complete media . After 1 h in suspension , cells were gently laid in the imaging chamber containing the coverslip and allowed to attach at 24 8 C for 30 min and spread at 37 8 C for 30 min . Then , unattached cells and coverslip were removed and 1 . 5 ml of fresh media was added . The chamber was sealed with paraﬁlm and transferred to a heated - stage and the cell front was imaged under 10 (cid:4) magniﬁcation at 0 and 12 h . Cell spreading assay In the assay , 4 . 8 cm 2 coverslips were coated with 10 m g / ml ﬁbronectin and blocked at 37 8 C for 30 min with 1 % BSA . Cells were lifted with 20 m M EDTA in PBS , pelleted at 300 g for 5 min and resuspended in complete media . Cell suspen - sions were then added over ﬁbronectin - coated coverslips and Human Molecular Genetics , 2009 , Vol . 18 , No . 23 4489 D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / h m g / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 18 / 23 / 4478 / 664093 b y gue s t on 16 J anua r y 2019 allowed to spread for 30 min . After spreading , coverslips were gently rinsed with PBS and ﬁxed in 3 % formaldehyde for 10 min . Cells were stained with rhodamine – phalloidin and imaged by epiﬂuorescence microscopy . Cell areas were traced and measured using ImageJ software . Internalization assays For internalization experiments , cells were seeded on glass coverslips for 12 – 36 h prior to experiments . For ﬂuid - phase uptake experiments , cells were incubated with 1 mg / ml 70 kDa dextran - TMR in complete media containing FBS at 37 8 C for 20 min . Coverslips were cooled to 4 8 C in PBS and washed extensively for 5 min before ﬁxation . For transferrin - FITC internalization experiments , cells were incubated for 12 h in starvation media ( 0 . 1 % FBS ) . Coverslips were rinsed and chilled on ice before adding 1 . 25 ml / well of transferrin ( 3 . 0 m g / ml ) in cold DMEM . Cells were transferred to 37 8 C for 10 min . Internalization was stopped by transferring the cells to ice and washing with ice - cold PBS . Non - internalized ligand was removed by washing with ice - cold 0 . 2N acetic acid containing 500 m M NaCl pH ¼ 2 . 0 for 45 s . Cells were washed with ice - cold PBS , ﬁxed and imaged by epiﬂuores - cence microscopy . Z - stack images of 8 – 10 random ﬁelds were captured at the same exposure times per experiment . Appropriate objectives were selected in order to both obtain multiple cells per ﬁeld and yet resolve all endocytic structures . Approximately 15 cells per imaging ﬁeld were obtained when imaging dextran - TMR uptake in human dermal ﬁbroblasts and HeLa at 20 (cid:4) and 63 (cid:4) objectives , respectively , and about three cells per ﬁeld were obtained when imaging transferrin - FITC uptake in human dermal ﬁbroblasts with a 63 (cid:4) objective . For image analysis , stacks were converted to single compo - site images . Background ﬂuorescence was removed using the ImageJ’s subtract background feature to remove continuously intense areas with a rolling ball radius of about 3 . 8 m m . Then images were despeckeled once to reduce additional noise . Speciﬁc ﬂuorescence intensity per cell per ﬁeld was calculated for several ﬁelds and used to quantify internalization .
