Small GTPases that regulate the actin cytoskeleton , such as Cdc42 and Rac are central regulators of podosome formation . The adaptor protein IRSp53 contains an I - BAR domain that deforms membranes into protrusions and binds to Rac , a CRIB motif that interacts with Cdc42 , an SH3 domain that binds to many actin cytoskeletal regulators with proline - rich peptides including VASP , and the C - terminal variable region by splicing . However , the role of IRSp53 and VASP in podosome formation had been unclear . Here we found that the knockdown of IRSp53 by RNAi attenuates podosome formation and migration in Src - transformed NIH3T3 ( NIH - Src ) cells . Importantly , the differences in the IRSp53 C - terminal splicing isoforms did not affect podosome formation . Overexpression of IRSp53 deletion mutants suggested the importance of linking small GTPases to SH3 binding partners . Interestingly , VASP physically interacted with IRSp53 in NIH - Src cells and was essential for podosome formation . These data highlight the role of IRSp53 as a linker of small GTPases to VASP for podosome formation . Citation : Oikawa T , Okamura H , Dietrich F , Senju Y , Takenawa T , et al .

The leading edge is characterized by the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia , downstream of the functions of the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42 , respectively [ 1 ] . Lamellipodia and filopodia are well - studied structures , because they can be detected within the cells on a two - dimensional plane such as a culture dish . Cell migration in the three - dimensional extracellular matrix ( ECM ) is an essential process for tumor cell invasion . Studies with cultured cells suggested that the podosome is the machinery for cell migration in the ECM . Podosomes contain molecules for actin polymeriza - tion as well as focal adhesions , and thus are considered to facilitate migration in the ECM [ 2 – 4 ] . The existence of podosomes in tissues has been reported recently [ 5 ] . Podosomes were first characterized in cells transformed with the Rous Sarcoma virus [ 6 , 7 ] , and the constitutive activation of the Src tyrosine kinase leads to podosome formation [ 8 ] . In addition to Src kinase , members of the Rho family of small GTPases , including Cdc42 and Rac , are reportedly essential for podosome formation [ 9 – 11 ] . The podosome is a small cylindrical structure rich in actin filaments , typically with a diameter of , 1 m m or less , and it develops into larger ring - like rosettes , which are thought to be assemblies of small podosomes . Studies of osteoclasts revealed a bundled actin core , surrounded by a branched actin array composed of the Arp2 / 3 complex and N - WASP , in each podosome [ 12 – 14 ] . IRSp53 consists of the I - BAR ( inverse BAR ) domain , the CRIB motif , the SH3 domain , and the C - terminal variable region by splicing [ 15 ] . The I - BAR domain is one of the subfamily domains in the BAR ( Bin - Amphiphysin - Rvs ) domain superfamily [ 16 ] . The BAR domain superfamily proteins deform and sense the membrane that fits each BAR domain structure , and thus have been hypothesized as ‘‘sensors’’ that assemble many binding partners , depending on the membrane curvature [ 17 – 20 ] . The BAR domains , including the I - BAR domain , typically fold into helix bundles and form dimer units for membrane binding . The helix bundle is one of the features of small GTPase binding , and some BAR domains reportedly bind to small GTPases directly . Indeed , the I - BAR domain of IRSp53 was initially named the Rac - binding domain ( RCB ) , because it binds to activated Rac [ 21 ] . The CRIB motif also binds to small GTPases , and that in IRSp53 specifically binds to Cdc42 [ 22 , 23 ] . In addition , the SH3 domain of IRSp53 binds to several actin regulators , including Eps8 , N - WASP , WAVE2 , MENA and VASP [ 15 , 24 , 25 ] . IRSp53 binding to Eps8 facilitates actin filament bundling [ 26 , 27 ] . Eps8 is also important for Rac activation , and was suggested to regulate podosome formation [ 28 , 29 ] . IRSp53 reportedly binds to N - WASP for filopodium formation [ 25 ] , and the role of N - WASP in podosome formation has been well established [ 14 ] . In contrast , PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 March 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 3 | e60528 the role of another Arp2 / 3 activator that binds to IRSp53 , WAVE2 , has been well established in lamellipodium formation , but it only plays a marginal role in podosome formation [ 8 , 30 ] . MENA and VASP belong to the Ena / VASP family proteins , which promote actin filament elongation [ 31 ] . In contrast to N - WASP and WAVE2 , the elongation mediated by Ena / VASP is not directly related to the Arp2 / 3 complex . Ena / VASP enhances the assembly of actin monomers at the filament ends . VASP had been shown to cooperate with IRSp53 in filopodia formation [ 22 , 23 , 32 ] . However , the roles of VASP and other members of the Ena / VASP family in podosome formation have not been clarified . The C - terminus of IRSp53 is spliced to create several isoforms . The shortest form ( S ) contains the PDZ - domain binding motif , where PDZ - domain containing proteins , such as Lin - 7 , interact for filopodium formation [ 33 ] . The other splicing isoforms ( M , L and T ) lack the PDZ binding sequence [ 15 ] . The splicing variants of IRSp53 , the M and L isoforms , have WH2 - like motifs at their C - termini , where actin monomer binding was confirmed [ 34 ] . The WH2 - like motif is also found in the paralogue of IRSp53 , IRTKS [ 35 ] . The role of T isoform specific amino - acid residues remains unclear . In this study , we analyzed the function of IRSp53 in podosome formation , and found that it connects small GTPases to VASP in the podosome formation by NIH - Src cells . Results Positive roles of IRSp53 in podosome formation and invasiveness in Src - transformed NIH3T3 cells NIH3T3 cells form podosomes when they are transformed with a constitutively active form of Src tyrosine kinase [ 8 ] . We used this transformed cell line , NIH - Src cells , as a model for podosome formation . In NIH - Src cells , small dot - like podosomes develop into large ‘‘rosette’’ - like podosomes . To examine the role of IRSp53 in podosome formation , we transfected the cells with the siRNA vector or siRNA oligonucleotides for IRSp53 . The amount Figure 1 .

We then examined the migration of the cells using a transwell chamber , with serum as the chemo - attractant . The migration of the cells with reduced IRSp53 expression was significantly impaired ( Fig . 1D ) . Subsequently , because the podosome is a structure that facilitates invasion into the ECM , we examined the invasion activity using a Matrigel invasion chamber . Again , the IRSp53 siRNA treatment dramat - ically reduced the invasion of the cells through the matrigel ( Fig . 1E ) . Redundancy between the IRSp53 splicing variants in podosome formation We then examined the specific effect of the IRSp53 siRNA on podosome formation , by restoring IRSp53 expression . The cells were sequentially transfected with the siRNA vector and the expression plasmid for each splicing isoform of human IRSp53 tagged with GFP ( Fig . 2 ) . The rescue cDNAs for human IRSp53 were constructed by substituting the nucleotides within the siRNA target , without changing the coding amino acids ( see the materials and methods section for details ) . Each of the splicing isoforms , including ( S ) with the PDZ binding sequence , the less - character - ized isoform ( T ) , and that with the WH2 - like motif ( L ) , was able to restore podosome formation , indicating that various C - terminal binding proteins were not involved in podosome formation ( Fig . 2 ) . Overexpression of the I - BAR domain of IRSp53 abrogates podosome formation We then used deletion mutants to test which domain of IRSp53 is important for podosome formation ( Fig . 3 ) . The overexpression of the wild - type ( WT ) , the C - terminal SH3 domain ( CT ) of IRSp53 , or the fragment without the I - BAR domain had no effects on podosome formation ( Fig . 3 ) . On the other hand , the expression of the constructs lacking the C - terminal SH3 domain ( D CT ) or with only the I - BAR domain fragment ( I - BAR ) suppressed podosome formation ( Fig . 3 ) . Because the I - BAR domain is known to bind to Rac , actin filaments , and membranes [ 15 ] , we prepared the mutant I - BAR BPM ( basic patch mutant ) , which is defective in both actin filament and membrane binding , and the I - BAR R128E / K130E mutant , which is selectively deficient in membrane binding [ 16 ] . When expressed in NIH - Src cells , the mutants suppressed podosome formation in a similar manner as the wild - type I - BAR ( Fig . 3B ) . Furthermore , IRSp53 with the BPM mutant was able to restore podosome formation in IRSp53 siRNA - transfected cells to the wild - type level ( Fig . 4A and B ) . We then examined the interaction between the BPM and Rac in cells by immunoprecip - itation , and found that the I - BAR BPM mutant still interacts with the active form of Rac ( Fig . 4C ) . Therefore , the I - BAR domain was thought to titrate the Rac activity from the podosomes , thus impairing their formation . Actually , the expression of a dominant negative form of Rac1 ( Rac N17T ) effectively suppressed podosome formation , as reported previously [ 9 – 11 ] ( Fig . 3B ) . Taken together , these results suggested that IRSp53 connects Rac signaling to downstream molecules for the actin filament reorganization in podosomes . The essential role of VASP in podosome formation We then tried to identify the molecules downstream of IRSp53 that participate in podosome formation . Since the role of VASP in podosome formation has not been characterized so far , we focused Figure 3 . Identification of the domains of IRSp53 required for podosome formation .

The immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that VASP interacted with IRSp53 in NIH - Src cells ( Fig . 5A ) . Therefore , we examined the role of VASP in podosome formation . The treatment with VASP siRNA decreased the amount of VASP in NIH - Src cells ( Fig . 5B ) . In these cells , podosome formation was dramatically reduced ( Fig . 5C and D ) . Together , these data suggested that IRSp53 and VASP cooperate in podosome formation ( Fig . 5E ) . Discussion In this study , we established the essential role of IRSp53 in podosome formation in NIH - Src cells . VASP appeared to be the actin regulatory molecule downstream of IRSp53 . Interestingly , the membrane deforming ability of IRSp53 was not involved in podosome formation . Since IRSp53 is a multi - domain protein , the importance of each domain might vary , depending on the cell type . For podosomes in NIH - Src cells , C - terminal splicing of IRSp53 was not essential , suggesting that protein binding at the C - terminal region , which is variable due to splicing , is not crucial . Importantly , the overex - pression of the D I - BAR mutant did not suppress podosome formation , and thus the role of the I - BAR domain in podosome formation might be marginal . However , it is possible that the D I - BAR mutant did not localize properly , and thus could not suppress podosome formation . In contrast , the deletion of the IRSp53 C - terminal region including the SH3 domain suppressed podosome formation , but it was much weaker than the RNAi of IRSp53 ( Fig . 3 ) . Therefore , the entire IRSp53 molecule is important for its integrated function in podosome formation , presumably down - stream of both Cdc42 and Rac ( Fig . 5E ) . The strong inhibition of podosome formation by the overex - pression of the I - BAR domain highlighted its role in podosome formation . IRSp53 was first proposed to function in actin filament bundling , through its I - BAR domain [ 36 ] . However , a recent study demonstrated that IRSp53 I - BAR does not bundle actin filaments under physiological conditions [ 37 ] . In this study , the BPM mutant of I - BAR , which is defective in actin filament binding [ 16 ] , also suppressed podosome formation , suggesting the relatively lower contribution of actin filament binding to the inhibition of podosomes . The I - BAR domain of IRSp53 was subsequently shown to be a subfamily of BAR domain superfamily proteins , in which the I - BAR domain binds to membranes and deforms them into the shape corresponding to the cellular protrusions [ 16 ] . In this study , we showed that the overexpression of both the I - BAR domain and its BPM mutant , which is also defective in membrane binding , suppressed podosome formation . In accordance with the overexpression analysis , podosome formation in NIH - Src cells with reduced IRSp53 by siRNA was rescued by the expression of the IRSp53 BPM mutant ( Fig . 4 ) . This phenomenon suggested that other binding partners than membranes and actin filaments would be titrated out , resulting in suppressed podosome formation . The I - BAR domain was first characterized as a Rac - binding domain [ 21 ] . Therefore , the titration of Rac could be one of the mechanisms for the suppression of podosome formation by the overexpression of the I - BAR domain , because the BPM retained Rac - binding ability in cells ( Fig . 4C ) . However , the I - BAR domain has several other binding partners with the NPY motif [ 38 ] . The NPY motif is present in the Tir protein , which is required for pedestal formation in enterohemorrhagic E . coli ( EHEC ) infection . Importantly , the NPY sequence is found in a wide range of proteins , such as PI - 3 kinase , LIM kinase , Intersectin , and ROCK , suggesting the possibility that the titration of such proteins by I - BAR overexpression can suppress podosome formation [ 38 ] . When we consider actin filament organization and podosomes , it would be interesting if IRSp53 functioned with VASP , because podosomes consist of not only branched actin filaments generated by the Arp2 / 3 complex and N - WASP , but also bundled filaments [ 13 ] . VASP does not participate in branched filament formation , but it antagonizes capping protein to promote the straight filaments . Indeed , among the SH3 binding partners of IRSp53 , N - WASP directly binds to Cdc42 . Therefore , Cdc42 signaling might induce the branched actin filaments through N - WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex independently or dependently on IRSp53 , and the straight bundled filaments with IRSp53 and VASP dependently on IRSp53 . VASP and MENA play well - established roles in filopodia and lamellipodia formation . However , this is the first study to establish their roles in podosome formation . VASP and MENA are reportedly associated with invasiveness [ 39 – 43 ] , suggesting that IRSp53 signaling to VASP or possibly to the MENA pathway would be important for cancer cell metastasis in vivo . Materials and Methods Plasmid construction , cell culture and transfection Mouse NIH cells transformed with Src ( NIH - Src cells ) were cultured as described previously [ 8 ] . The IRSp53 constructs were described previously [ 16 , 21 ] . For the D I - BAR construct , the sequence lacking the N - terminal 250 amino acid residues was cloned with the human IRSp53 cDNA as the template . Stealth siRNA oligonucleotides for mouse IRSp53 were purchased from Invitrogen , and three independent sequences were transfected simultaneously for one gene to reduce the non - specific reduction of mRNA ( Figures 1B - E , 4 and 5 ) . For Figures 1A and 2 , siRNA was produced from the vector [ 16 ] , and the rescue cDNAs for human IRSp53 were constructed by substituting the nucleotides ( underlined ) within the siRNA target to 5 9 - GGAGCTACAGTA - CATAGAC - 3 9 , without changing the coding amino acids . Transfection was performed with the Lipofectamine LTX and PLUS reagents ( Invitrogen ) , according to the manufacturer’s protocols . Two days after transfection , the cells were analyzed . Antibodies The anti - IRSp53 antibody was affinity purified from rabbit serum [ 16 ] . Anti - c - Tubulin ( SIGMA , mouse monoclonal ) and anti - VASP ( Cell Signaling , rabbit monoclonal ) were purchased . Figure 4 . Dispensable role of I - BAR domain for podosome formation .
