Posted on 3 January 2017 Highlights : - Smurf1 is responsible for ICAP - 1 monoubiquitination - ICAP - 1 monoubiquitination promotes Fibronectin density sensing in a  1 integrin - dependent manner - ICAP - 1 is required for rigidity sensing in a  1 integrin - independent manner - ICAP - 1 monoubiquitination serves as a switch from ROCK2 - to MRCK  - mediated contractility Abstract Cell migration is a complex process requiring density and rigidity sensing of the microenvironment to adapt cell migratory speed through focal adhesion and actin cytoskeleton regulation . ICAP - 1 , a  1 integrin partner , is essential for ensuring integrin activation cycle and focal adhesion formation . We show that ICAP - 1 is monoubiquitinated by Smurf1 , preventing ICAP - 1 binding to  1 integrin . The non - ubiquitinable form of ICAP - 1 modifies  1 integrin focal adhesion organization and interferes with fibronectin density sensing . ICAP - 1 is also required for adapting cell migration in response to substrate stiffness in a  1 integrin - independent manner . ICAP - 1 monoubiquitination regulates rigidity sensing by increasing MRCK  - dependent cell contractility through myosin phosphorylation independently of substrate rigidity . We provide evidence that ICAP - 1 monoubiquitination helps in switching from ROCK2 - mediated to MRCK  - mediated cell contractility . ICAP - 1 monoubiquitination serves as a molecular switch to coordinate extracellular matrix density and rigidity sensing thus acting as a critical modulator of cell migration and mechanosensing . J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e • A d v a n c e a r t i c l e Introduction Motile cells continuously sample in space and time the heterogeneity in the composition and stiffness of their extracellular matrix ( ECM ) through integrin - mediated focal adhesions ( FA ) ( Moore et al . , 2010 ) . As mechanical link between ECM and actin stress fibers , integrins are crucial for force transmission and signal transduction ( Moore et al . , 2010 ) . FA assembly , growth and maintenance depend on actomyosin traction forces which adapt to the substrate elasticity ( Burridge and Wittchen , 2013 ) . In spite of alternative pathways involving MRCK , MLCK or mDia ( Burridge and Wittchen , 2013 ; Chen et al . , 2014 ; Jégou et al . , 2013 ; Totsukawa et al . , 2004 ) , a key event is the modulation of cellular contractility through myosin - based contractility and ROCK activity . However , signaling pathways underlying FA - mediated rigidity sensing and mechanoresponse are not fully understood . ICAP - 1 , a negative regulator of  1 integrin enables the cell to sense ECM density to adapt its adhesive and migratory responses ( Millon - Frémillon et al . , 2008 ) and to control fibronectin ( FN ) remodeling ( Brunner et al . , 2011 ; Faurobert et al . , 2013 ) . ICAP - 1 specifically binds to the cytoplasmic tail of  1 integrin maintaining the integrin in its inactivated form by competing with the two activators named Kindlin and talin ( Brunner et al . , 2011 ; Millon - Frémillon et al . , 2008 ; Montanez et al . , 2008 ; Ye et al . , 2014 ) . ICAP - 1 also binds to ROCK1 ( Peter et al . , 2006 ) . Thanks to these interactions , ICAP - 1 may be a good candidate for regulating myosin - based contractility and cellular response to ECM stiffness . Tunable post - translational modifications may control ICAP - 1 functions enabling the cell to adapt its migratory response . As ubiquitination is emerging as important for cell migration dynamics and cell contractility ( Carvallo et al . , 2010 ; Sahai et al . , 2007 ; Schaefer et al . , 2012 ; Su et al . , 2013 ; Wang et al . , 2003 ) , we addressed whether ubiquitination may control ICAP - 1 functions enabling the cell to adapt its migratory response . Here , we show that ICAP - 1 is monoubiquitinated by SMAD ubiquitin regulatory factor 1 ( Smurf1 ) . This monoubiquitination impairs ICAP - 1 binding to  1 J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e • A d v a n c e a r t i c l e integrin and is involved in ECM density and rigidity sensing as well as in coordination of the dynamics of adhesion sites and contractile machinery . ICAP - 1 monoubiquitination plays an important role in the responses of migrating cells to mechanical inputs in a  1 integrin independent manner by promoting the switch from a ROCK - mediated to a MRCK - mediated contractility pathway . J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e • A d v a n c e a r t i c l e Results 1 . ICAP - 1 is monoubiquitinated by Smurf1 at  1 integrin binding site To investigate ICAP - 1 ubiquitination , we performed nickel - bead pull - down experiments on Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) cells transfected with ICAP - 1 either in the presence or absence of His - tagged ubiquitin co - transfection . The proteasome inhibitor MG132 was added to prevent proteasomal degradation of any ubiquinated ICAP - 1 . When expressed alone , ICAP - 1 displayed on western blot an apparent molecular weight that was slightly greater than 20 kDa , whereas co - transfection with His - tagged ubiquitin and pull - down on nickel beads resulted isolation of ICAP - 1 under higher molecular weight forms , with a band above 35 kDa ( Fig . 1A ) , showing that ICAP - 1 is indeed ubiquitinated . This band above 35kDa most likely corresponds to ICAP - 1 monoubiquitination . HA - Ubi have been coexpressed with ICAP - 1 fused to Flag and our results show the ability of ICAP - 1 - Flag to be recognized by both anti - Flag and anti - HA antibodies after immunoprecipitation with Flag antibodies ( Fig . 1B ) , confirming the ability of ICAP - 1 to be ubiquitinated . Further , to identify which lysine residue is monoubiquitinated , we analyzed the ability of truncated forms of ICAP - 1 to be monoubiquitinated ( Fig . 1C ) . We determined that the monoubiquitination site was located in the binding domain for β1 integrin . The point mutations of either one of the 2 lysine residues present in this domain identified lysine K158 as the site of monoubiquitination , as its substitution in arginine led to the absence of the 35kDa band ( Fig . 1D ) without changing ICAP - 1 polyubiquitination states ( Fig . 1D ) . The non - ubiquitinable K158R mutant was even less stable than wild - type ( WT ) ICAP - 1 , suggesting that the monoubiquitinated form of ICAP - 1 is not targeted for proteasomal degradation but rather may have asignaling function ( Fig . S1A , S1B ) . Because Smurf1 catalyzes the ubiquitination of the integrin activator talin ( Huang et al . , 2009 ) , we hypothesized that Smurf1 could be responsible for ICAP - 1 monoubiquitination . To test this hypothesis , Smurf1 was silenced by siRNA with a high efficiency in reducing Smurf1 transcript and protein levels without affecting ICAP - 1 expression ( Fig . 1E ) . ICAP1 monoubiquitination was blocked when Smurf1 was knocked J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e • A d v a n c e a r t i c l e down , suggesting that Smurf1 is necessary for promoting ICAP - 1 monoubiquitination ( Fig . 1E - 1F ) . Pull - down assay shows that purified recombinant Smurf1 - GST is able to bind to exogenously expressed ICAP - 1 in CHO cells in contrast with the null interaction with GST alone ( fifty fold less ) or with the weak binding to GST fused to Smurf2 ( tenfold less ) ( Fig . S1 C ) . Smurf2 has been chosen as a control because overlapping but distinct substrate and regulator specificity has been observed between Smurf1 and Smurf2 ( Lu et al . , 2008 , 2011 ) . The coimmunoprecipitation between Smurf1 - myc and ICAP - 1 - Flag expressed in CHO cells confirms that Smurf1 and ICAP - 1 belongs to the same complex ( Fig . S1D ) . The direct interaction between Smurf1 and ICAP - 1 was demonstrated by Elisa assay using purified recombinant GST - Smurf1 and purified recombinant ICAP - 1 - His ( Fig . S1E ) . Finally , our results indicate that Smurf1 is responsible for ICAP - 1 monoubiquitination . 2 . The monoubiquitination of ICAP - 1 prevents binding to  1 integrin and regulates  1 integrin - dependent adhesion According to structure predictions and cristallographic data ( Chang et al . , 2002 ; Liu et al . , 2013 ) , the monoubiquitination site is located in the  1 integrin binding domain of ICAP - 1 facing the Ile residue important for the binding to  1 integrin ( Fig . 2A ) . As this monoubiquitination could interfere with ICAP - 1 /  1 integrin interaction , we used two classical ways to produce an ubiquitinated form of a protein ( Torrino et al . , 2011 ; Visvikis et al . , 2008 ) : first by co - transfecting ICAP - 1 with His - tagged ubiquitin and second by creating a chimera made of ubiquitin fused to the C - terminal tail of ICAP - 1 ( ICAP - 1 Ubi ) ( Fig . 2B ) . We tested the ability of WT , non - ubiquitinable ( K158R ) , and monoubiquitinated ICAP - 1 ( endogenous ubiquitination or chimera ) to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of either  1 integrin or  3 integrin fused with GST or with GST alone by pull - down assay ( Fig . S2A ) or by Elisa assay ( Fig . 2C ) . As previously reported ( Millon - Frémillon et al . , 2008 ) , we confirmed that ICAP - 1 specifically interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of  1 integrin ( Fig . 2C , S2A ) . Furthermore , the non - ubiquitinated K158R mutant retained the ability to interact with the cytoplasmic J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e • A d v a n c e a r t i c l e domain of  1 integrin , whereas both ubiquitinated forms of ICAP - 1 ( His - tagged and chimeric ) lost the capacity to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of  1 integrin ( Fig . 2C , S2A ) . These results show that ICAP - 1 monoubiquitination prevents the interaction of ICAP - 1 with  1 integrin . Next we investigated whether the monoubiquitination of ICAP - 1 could affect FA organization by rescuing ICAP - 1 - deficient osteoblast cells with similar stable expressions of WT ICAP - 1 , non - ubiquitinatable ICAP - 1 K158R and of the chimeric ubiquitinated form . All osteoblast cell lines were able to spread onto FN and develop FA containing β1 integrins , as revealed by ( 9EG7 ) antibody staining for activated β1 integrin ( Fig . 2D ) . Like ICAP - 1 - deficient cells , cells expressing the ubiquitinated form of ICAP - 1 displayed more numerous β1 integrin - containing FA compared with cells expressing the WT form ( Fig 2D , 2E , 2F ) because of the inability of the monoubiquitinated ICAP - 1 to inhibit β1 integrin . Conversely , cells expressing the non - ubiquitinable ICAP - 1 K158R mutant displayed fewer , smaller and more punctate adhesion sites ( Fig 2D , 2E , 2F ) compared with those of WT ICAP - 1 likely due to its ability to interact with β1 integrin and thus inhibit the assembly of larger FA ( Bouvard et al . , 2007 ; Millon - Frémillon et al . , 2008 ) . As Smurf1 is responsible for ICAP - 1 monoubiquitination , we investigated whether the formation of β1 integrin - containing FA was dependent on Smurf1 activity . As expected , the deletion of Smurf1 led to a decrease in the number and area of β1 integrin - containing FA ( Fig . S2B , S2C , S2D ) phenocopying the non - ubiquitinatable ICAP - 1 K158R phenotype ( Fig 2D , 2E , 2F ) . Conversely , the ubiquitinated ICAP - 1 was able to bypass the destructive effect of Smurf1 deletion on  1 integrin - containing focal adhesions ( Fig S2B , S2C , S2D ) . Thus , Smurf - 1 - mediated ICAP - 1 monoubiquitination plays a crucial role in the organization of β1 integrin - containing FA by preventing or disrupting the ICAP - 1 / β1 integrin interaction . J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e • A d v a n c e a r t i c l e 3 . ICAP - 1 monoubiquitination is a signal coordinating FN density sensing with rigidity sensing . We wondered whether ICAP - 1 monoubiquitination was involved in FN density and rigidity sensing . To test an effect on FN density sensing , single - cell tracking of sparse cells was performed to monitor the migration speed of ICAP - 1 - deficient osteoblast or MEF cells expressing WT ICAP - 1 , K158R ICAP - 1 or ICAP - 1 Ubi in the presence of increasing concentrations of FN . As expected ( Discher et al . , 2005 ; Engler et al . , 2006 ; Raab et al . , 2012 ) , WT ICAP - 1 - expressing osteoblasts ( Fig . 3A and movies S1 - S2 ) or MEFs ( Fig . S3A ) displayed faster migration rates with increasing FN density . While the migratory speed of the cells expressing the ICAP - 1 ubiquitinated form depended on ECM density like ICAP - 1 null cells , the cells expressing the non - ubiquitinable K158R mutant maintain the same migration speed whatever the density of FN coating ( Fig . 3A , Fig . S3A and movies S3 - S4 ) . Moreover , the ability to adapt their migration response to ECM density was lost in cells treated with siRNA against Smurf1 but was rescued in cells co - expressing the monoubiquitinated ICAP - 1 showing that the Smurf1 - dependent monoubiquitination of ICAP - 1 is necessary for cells to sense and respond to FN density ( Fig . S3B ) . To explore the possibility that the inability of the K158R mutant to adapt its migration speed to FN density could be due to a greater capacity to lock β1 integrin in its inactivated form than WT ICAP - 1 , we analyze the response of cells treated with β1 integrin blocking antibodies to increasing FN density . We showed that these cells were unable to sense the density of FN or adapt their migratory behavior ( Fig . 3B ) , confirming the requirement for  1 integrin activation for the adaptation of the cell migration rate to the FN density . Additionally , cells co - expressing a  1 integrin mutant that lacks ICAP - 1 binding (  1 V787T ) with the ICAP - 1 K158R mutant or in the context of silenced Smurf1 were still able to adapt their migration speed to the FN density ( Fig . 3B and S3C ) . Therefore , the unresponsiveness of cells to the FN density is most likely due to the inhibitory interaction between the non - ubiquitinable ICAP - 1 and  1 integrin . Overall , ICAP - 1 monoubiquitination by Smurf1 is required to release ICAP - J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e • A d v a n c e a r t i c l e 1 inhibitory effect on  1 integrin in order to permit the adaptation of cell migration to ECM density . We next evaluated the effects of ICAP - 1 monoubiquitination on the ECM rigidity sensitivity . Osteoblast cells ( Fig . 3C ) or MEF cells ( Fig . S3D ) infected with ICAP - 1 WT , ICAP - 1 K158R and ICAP - 1 Ubi were plated onto FN - conjugated elastomeric PAA gels with increasing Young’s modulus ( E ) and monitored for cell migration . As expected , the WT ICAP - 1 cells moved more quickly on stiffer gels than they did on softer gels ( 40 % increase on the stiffer substrate ) ( Fig . 3C , S3D and movies S5 - S6 ) . Cells expressing ICAP - 1 K158R still responded to the increase in matrix rigidity whereas cells expressing the monoubiquitinated ICAP - 1 displayed a constant migration velocity that was independent of the stiffness of the substrate like ICAP - 1 deficient cells ( Fig . 3C , S3D and movies S7 - S8 ) . However the migration speed of ICAP - 1 - / - cells is slightly but significantly higher as compared to that of ICAP - 1 Ubi cells . This suggests that ICAP - 1 monoubiquitination also controlled the capacity of cells to adapt their velocity to ECM rigidity . As monoubiquitination prevents ICAP - 1 /  1 integrin interaction , we then investigated whether rigidity sensing was dependent on ICAP - 1 /  1 integrin interaction . Cells expressing the  1 integrin V787T mutant unable to interact with ICAP - 1 still adapt their velocity in response to the external rigidity ( Fig . 3D ) whereas ICAP - 1 deficiency led to insensitiveness to substrate stiffness ( Fig . 3C ) . Thus , the presence of ICAP - 1 is required even though ICAP - 1 interaction with  1 integrin is dispensable for rigidity sensing . Monoubiquitination of ICAP - 1 is a signal that allows the sensing of matrix density and rigidity by decoupling ICAP - 1 inhibitory role on  1 integrin from an unexpected role independent on its interaction with  1 integrin . 4 . The monoubiquitination of ICAP - 1 increases cell contractility As rigidity sensing is associated with cell contractility , we sought to determine whether the monoubiquitinated form of ICAP - 1 might interfere with cell contractility . First , as contractility marker , we analyzed the phosphorylation state of MLC ( pMLC ) by Western blot on WT , and J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e • A d v a n c e a r t i c l e ICAP - Ubi and ICAP - 1 deficient cells plated onto FN - coated plastic or elastomeric PAA gels with a Young’s modulus ( E ) of 4 or 50 kPa ( Fig . S4A ) . As expected , the level of pMLC in total cell lysates of cells expressing ICAP - 1 WT increased with the substrate rigidity . ICAP - 1 deficient cells displayed the same behavior as ICAP - 1 WT cells . In contrast , cells expressing the monoubiquitinated ICAP - 1 showed a constant level of p - MLC independently of the rigidity of the substrate . This loss of p - MLC regulation is correlated with the inability of ICAP - 1 Ubi cells to adapt their velocity to ECM rigidity ( Fig . 3C ) . In addition , an increase of p - MLC staining along the stress fibers in ICAP - 1 Ubi cells was noted ( Fig . 4A ) . To investigate whether the monoubiquitinated ICAP - 1 is involved in the genesis and modulation of forces applied to the substratum , traction force microscopy ( TFM ) was used . Traction forces generated by the cells were twice higher in ICAP - 1 Ubi cells as compared to the WT cells and ICAP - 1 deficient cells ( Fig . 4B ) . Therefore , the monoubiquitination of ICAP - 1 increases cell contractility by forcing the phosphorylation of myosin independently of the substrate rigidity . 5 . The monoubiquitination of ICAP - 1 drives MRCK  - mediated cell contractility Cell contractility relies on the balance between ROCK , MLCK and mDia activities to control elongation and organization of actin filament ( Burridge and Wittchen , 2013 ) . To explore the contractility pathways potentially affected by ICAP - 1 - Ubi , a pharmacological approach was used by testing ROCK , MLCK and mDia inhibitors ( Y27632 , ML7 and SmifH2 respectively ) on the migration of osteoblasts adhered to 4 kPa gels coated with 5 µg / ml of FN . Like WT cells , ICAP - 1 Ubi cells migrate slower upon MLCK and mDia inhibition ( Fig S4B ) . As previously described ( Totsukawa et al . , 2000 ) , WT cells migrate faster upon ROCK inhibition . In contrast , ICAP - 1 Ubi cells were insensitive to Y27632 treatment since no change in migratory speed response was observed as compared with the WT cells ( Fig . S4B ) . This insensitivity to ROCK inhibition in ICAP - 1 Ubi cells is not due to the loss of ICAP - 1 Ubi /  1 integrin interaction since cells expressing the V787T mutant of  1 integrin , which is unable to J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e • A d v a n c e a r t i c l e interact with ICAP - 1 are still sensitive to ROCK inhibition ( Fig . S4C ) . Thus ICAP - Ubi cell migration is independent on ROCK - controlled contractility suggesting an alternative contractile pathway for ICAP - 1 Ubi cells . Besides regulating ROCK1 ( Peter et al . , 2006 ) , ICAP - 1 has been shown to inhibit Cdc42 and Rac1 ( Degani et al . , 2002 ) which are involved in the regulation of MRCK . Therefore we sought whether ICAP - 1 could regulate MRCK dependent cell contractility ( Leung et al . , 1998 ) . To test this hypothesis , we used a SiRNA strategy to knock down ROCK1 , ROCK2 , MRCK  and MRCK  ( Fig . 4C , 4D ) . The WT ICAP - 1 cells moved more quickly on stiffer gels than they did on softer gels whatever the SiRNA used except in conditions of ROCK2 deletion suggesting that WT cells adapt their migratory behavior through a ROCK2 - dependent contractility and are independent of ROCK1 , MRCK  and MRCK  ( Fig . 4C ) . In contrast , only MRCK  silencing in ICAP - 1 Ubi cells is able to increase the cell migration speed when rigidity of the substrate is increased ( Fig . 4D ) . Thus the cell contractility mode imposed by ICAP - 1 monoubiquitination is dependent on MRCK  and is independent of ROCK1 , ROCK2 and MRCK  . To confirm the involvement of MRCK  in the monoubiquitinated ICAP - 1 dependent phosphorylation of myosin , we tested the effect of SiRNA against MRCK  or ROCK2 on the decoration of stress fibers by P - myosin ( Fig . 4E ) . Whereas the siRNA against ROCK2 decreased the level of P - myosin in WT cells , the depletion of MRCK  significantly reduced the level of P - myosin in cells infected with ICAP - Ubi . Thus ICAP - 1 monoubiquitination favors the phosphorylation of myosin II dependent on the activity of MRCK  whereas ROCK2 activity is responsible for the phosphorylation of myosin II in WT cells . Finally ICAP - 1 monoubiquitination allows the switch from ROCK2 - mediated to MRCK  - mediated cell contractility . J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e • A d v a n c e a r t i c l e Discussion Our data show that monoubiquitination of ICAP - 1 , an integrin cytoplasmic domain associated protein , by Smurf1 is involved in regulating the balance between adhesion and contractility . ICAP - 1 monoubiquitination inhibits its binding to β1 integrin subsequently regulating the number and organization of β1 integrin - containing FA . ICAP - 1 and its monoubiquitinated form may be critical mediators involved in the balance between ROCK2 and MRCK  activities in order to adapt cell contractility to the variability of ECM stiffness . Our results show that these two functions of ICAP - 1 are integrated by the cell to sense both matrix density and rigidity . Smurf1 as a node to control focal adhesion dynamics and cell contractility In addition to its ability to ubiquitinate talin ( Huang et al . , 2009 ) , Smurf1 was a good candidate for ICAP - 1 monoubiquitination because Smurf1 associates with the CCM complex ( Crose et al . , 2009 ) which interacts with ICAP - 1 ( Hilder et al . , 2007 ) . Smurf1 also possesses an NPXY motif that might be able to interact with ICAP - 1 PTB domain . Smurf1 is also involved in cell polarity and cell migration ( Sahai et al . , 2007 ; Wang et al . , 2003 ) . We demonstrated that the monoubiquitination of ICAP - 1 by Smurf1 is not involved in ICAP - 1 degradation via the proteasome , but rather , regulates the assembly and organization of FA by modulating the ICAP - 1 /  1 integrin interaction . ICAP - 1 /  1 integrin interface is likely disrupted upon ICAP - 1 monoubiquitination since lys158 is in close vicinity of Ile138 residue known to be important for  1 integrin interaction ( Chang et al . , 2002 ; Liu et al . , 2013 ) . In addition to their canonical roles in cell growth and differentiation through TGF signaling ( Zhu et al . , 1999 ) , accumulating evidence indicates that Smurfs play key roles in regulating cell adhesion and migration . Smurf1 is localized in lamellipodia and filopodia with a fraction of Smurf1 in FA ( Huang et al . , 2009 ; Wang et al . , 2003 ) . Smurf1 ubiquitinates molecules involved in both cell adhesion and contractility . Smurf1 controls talin head degradation , and subsequently adhesion stability and cell migration ( Huang et al . , 2009 ) . RhoA ubiquitination J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e • A d v a n c e a r t i c l e by Smurf1 causes its degradation at the leading edge of migrating cells and promotes lamellipodium formation ( Sahai et al . , 2007 ; Wang et al . , 2003 ) . Our data demonstrate that Smurf1 is a node controlling both FA dynamics and cell contractility through a common target , ICAP - 1 . ICAP - 1 monoubiquitination none only regulates the number and organization of β1 integrin - containing FA but also inhibits ROCK signaling and promotes MRCK signaling pathway . Therefore , we add another piece of evidence showing the inhibition of the RhoA / ROCK pathway by Smurf1 , and we demonstrate for the first time that Smurf1 controls a switch from a ROCK - dependent to a MRCK - dependent cell contractility . The monoubiquitination of ICAP - 1 as a switch from ROCK2 - mediated to MRCK  - mediated contractility In addition to its role in  1 integrin activation cycle ( Millon - Frémillon et al . , 2008 ) , ICAP - 1 interferes with small GTPase signalling and cell contractility by putting a cap on RhoA activation ( Faurobert et al . , 2013 ) and inhibiting Rac1 and Cdc42 ( Degani et al . , 2002 ) . So far how ICAP - 1 can regulate both RhoA / ROCK signaling and Cdcd42 / Rac1 pathway was unclear . It has been described a cooperation between RhoA - ROCK and Cdc42 / Rac1 - MRCK signaling to control cell contractility cell polarity , morphology and morphogenesis ( Gally et al . , 2009 ; Unbekandt and Olson , 2014 ; Wilkinson et al . , 2005 ) . Their respective contribution might depend on ECM rigidity . ICAP - 1 , independently of its interaction with  1 integrin could act as a sensor of ECM rigidity differently modulating the activity of each enzyme depending on the substrate stiffness . It could act by playing on the level of activation of RhoA / Rac1 / Cdc42 and by directly modulating the activity of ROCK2 and MRCK  . Thus we propose that ICAP - 1 monoubiquination by Smurf1 is a key event leading to a switch from ROCK2 - mediated to MRCK  - mediated cell contractility . ICAP - 1 and its monoubiquitinated form regulate ROCK2 and MRCK  dependent MLC phosphorylation independently of interaction with  1 integrin . It is on line with previous studies which do not attribute a major role of  1 integrin in ECM rigidity sensing ( Jiang et al . , 2006 ) . Finally , ICAP - 1 contributes to an elaborate signaling network responsible for maintaining cell tensional homeostasis , going J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e • A d v a n c e a r t i c l e from the dynamics of cell adhesion to the adaptation of contractile actomyosin machinery . ICAP - 1 may function in  1 integrin dependent and independent pathways to orchestrate both the chemo and mechanical regulation of cell migration . These two pathways might regulate distinct signaling cascades through a switch operated by Smurf1 to adapt cellular migratory response ( Fig . 5 ) . ICAP - 1 is essential in rigidity sensing and its monoubiquitination might be crucial to adapt cells to the local variation of ECM stiffness in tissues or change of ECM composition during development or in pathological situations . ICAP - 1 monoubiquitination would adapt the cell contractility to substrate stiffness by controlling the balance between ROCK2 - and MRCK  - mediated cell contractility . In future studies , it will be important to identify the factors that are regulated by ICAP - 1 independently of its interaction with  1 integrin in order to develop a more complete understanding of the functions of ICAP - 1 in mechanosensing . J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e • A d v a n c e a r t i c l e Experimental procedures Plasmid construction The plasmids pCMVFlag - Smurf1 WT , pGEX4T1 - Smurf1 WT , pGEX4T1 - Smurf2 WT , pRK5 - Myc - Smurf1 and pRK5 - HA - Ubiquitin - WT were obtained from Addgene ( Cambridge , USA , numbers 11752 , 13502 , 13504 , 13676 and 17608 ) . pGEX4T1 plasmids containing the  1 or  3 integrin cytoplasmic domain , as well as pCLMFG retroviral vectors containing WT  1 integrin or the V787T mutant , have been previously described ( Brunner et al . , 2011 ) . The pSG5 - ubiquitin - His vector was a kind gift from Dr . S . Khochbin ( U823 INSERM - UJF , Grenoble , France ) . The full - length cDNA of WT human ICAP - 1 was subcloned into the Eco RI and Bam HI sites of the pBabe - puro retroviral vector ( pBabe - ICAP - 1 WT ) . The K158R substitution was introduced into the ICAP - 1 cDNA via site - directed mutagenesis ( pBabe - ICAP - 1 K158R ) . The myc tag was inserted at the 3’ end of the ICAP - 1 or ubiquitin cDNA using PCR . The myc - tagged ICAP - 1 cDNA was subcloned between the Bam HI and Eco RI sites of the pcDNA3 . 1 expression vector and mutated to generate the K158R mutant .

Smurf1 is able to monoubiquitinate ICAP - 1 . The monoubiquitination of ICAP - 1 by Smurf1 is required to release ICAP - 1 inhibitory effect on  1 integrin , thereby facilitating the activation / deactivation cycle of  1 integrin important for ECM density sensing and adaptive cell migration responses . The monoubiquitination of ICAP - 1 allows the switch from ROCK2 - mediated to MRCK  - mediated cell contractility to control ECM rigidity sensing .
