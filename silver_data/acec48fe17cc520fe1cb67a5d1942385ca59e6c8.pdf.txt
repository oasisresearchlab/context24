Front . Hum . Neurosci . 4 : 62 . doi : 10 . 3389 / fnhum . 2010 . 00062 The present paper by Krawczyk et al . ( 2010 ) adds to a growing list of studies that have shown analogical reasoning to be critically dependent on what is known as executive functioning in the neuropsychological lit - erature , and working memory in the cogni - tive ( neuro ) science literature . Specifically , analogy requires the maintenance , manipu - lation , and selective activation ( or inhibi - tion ) of mental representations to identify , map correspondences , and draw inferences about higher - order similarity relationships ( e . g . , Waltz et al . , 2000 ; Morrison et al . , 2004 ; Bunge et al . , 2005 , 2009 ; Morrison , 2005 ; Green et al . , 2006 ; Cho et al . , 2007 , 2010 ; Krawczyk et al . , 2008 ; Morrison and Cho , 2008 ) . Consistent with this , popula - tions with limited executive functioning resources have shown reduced analogy performance when required to integrate multiple relations and / or inhibit featural distractors in favor of relational similar - ity ( e . g . , TBI adolescents : Krawczyk et al . , 2010 ; children : Richland et al . , 2006 , 2010 ; Wright et al . , 2008 ; Thibaut et al . , 2010 ; older adults : Viskontas et al . , 2004 ; and brain damaged adults : Morrison et al . , 2004 ; Krawczyk et al . , 2008 ) . So is analogical reasoning simply another measure of execu - tive function ? Analogy is pervasive in everyday learn - ing and discovery . Importantly it allows us to make sense of and make inferences about new situations and information with respect to things we already know and understand ( Holyoak and Thagard , 1995 ; Dunbar and Blanchette , 2001 ) . Thus , theories of the development of analogy in children have frequently focused on rela - tional knowledge as a necessary precondi - tion for analogy ( Rattermann and Gentner , 1998 ; Goswami , 2001 ) . The importance of relational knowledge may also be seen in patients with damage to the temporal lobe . Morrison et al . ( 2004 ) and Krawczyk et al . ( 2008 ) and colleagues have previously found that patients with broad damage to anterior temporal lobe , an area associated with semantic knowledge , have difficulty with both verbal and visual analogies in spite of having preserved executive func - tions ; however , the patterns of deficit are different than those of patients with dam - age to prefrontal cortex and their associated executive dysfunction . These findings are consistent with the current paper’s finding that cortical differences in both prefrontal and temporal regions were associated with lower analogy performance . We have recently begun to explore how executive functions and relational knowl - edge , and their underlying brain networks , may work together in the service of anal - ogy . In one study , Richland et al . ( 2010 ) , we exploited cross - cultural differences in relational knowledge and discovered a dissociation between the ability to inhibit featural distractors and integrate relations in analogy , two functions associated with executive functions which have traditionally correlated in studies of analogy ( see Cho et al . , 2010 for an exception using neu - roimaging ) . Using a computational model of analogy we offered an explanation of the results , suggesting that more advanced relational knowledge structures reduce the demands for executive functions in analogy ( Morrison et al . , in press ) . Thus , prefrontal and temporal networks work together in analogy and the development or advanced functioning on one area affect demands on the other . In fact , we have also shown via modeling that the development of such advanced relational knowledge networks themselves may be dependent on executive functions ( Doumas et al . , 2010 ) . Thus , analogy is not simply another measure of executive functions , rather it is a whole brain activity , that is a profound test of our ability to think in everyday life , and as such is an excellent measure to evalu - ate the impact of traumatic brain injury on patients’ ability to function .
