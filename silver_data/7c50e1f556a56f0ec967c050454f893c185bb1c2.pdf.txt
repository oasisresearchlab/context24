The polyphosphoinositides ( PPIs ) , phosphatidyl - inositol3 , 4 - bisphosphate ( PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ) , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , andPI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , prevent CP from binding to barbed ends , but three different assays showed that none of these lipids dissociate CP from fila - ments at concentrations that block CP binding to barbed ends . The affinity of fission yeast CP for barbed ends is a thousandfold less than mouse CP , because of a slower association rate con - stant ( 1 . 1 (cid:1) 10 5 M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 ) and a faster dissociation rate constant ( 0 . 004 s (cid:2) 1 ) . PPIs do not inhibit binding of fission yeast CP to filament ends . Comparison of homology models revealed that fission yeast CP lacks a large patch of basic residues along the actin - binding surface on mouse CP . PPIs binding to this site might interfere sterically with capping , but this site would be inaccessible when CP is bound to the end of a filament . The motility of animal cells depends on the coordinated assembly of actin filaments at the leading edge . Arp2 / 3 complex promotes actin polymerization by nucleating filaments that grow as branches from a mother filament ( 1 , 2 ) . Capping pro - tein ( CP , 3 called CapZ in muscle ) appears to play an important role in generating the zone of short , highly branched actin fila - ments at the leading edge . CP is a heterodimer of structurally similar (cid:1) and (cid:2) subunits that form a mushroom - like structure with one flexible and one immobile COOH - terminal “tentacle” that bind the two terminal subunits of an actin filament ( 3 ) . CP binds the barbed end of actin filaments tightly with a K d of 0 . 1 – 1 n M . Given an association rate constant of 3 – 4 (cid:3) M (cid:1) 1 s (cid:1) 1 and a cytoplasmic concentration of 1 (cid:3) M ( 4 ) , CP should termi - nate the growth of actin filaments with a half - time of about 0 . 2 s after their nucleation . Terminating growth quickly keeps the filaments short , so that they do not buckle under the force of polymerization as they push the membrane forward . Vertebrate CP dissociates from barbed ends with a half - time of 30 min ( 4 ) , far too slow for simple , spontaneous dissociation to be involved with the conversion of the network of short , branched filaments at the leading edge to longer , unbranched filaments toward the cell body . As CP prevents both dissocia - tion of subunits from the barbed end and end - to - end filament annealing , some mechanism must accelerate the removal of CP from filament ends . Bothlipidsandproteins , suchasEna / VASP ( 5 – 7 ) andCARMIL ( 8 ) , can inhibit the interaction of CP with actin filaments . Polyphosphatidylinositides ( PPIs ) bind CP and block its inter - action with filaments both in vivo ( 9 ) and in vitro ( 10 ) . Addition of PIP 2 to mixtures of capped filaments , CP , and actin mono - mers in vitro increases the rate of polymerization ( 4 ) . These experiments led to the widely accepted view that PPIs not only inhibit association of CP with barbed ends but also dissociate CP from actin filaments . These two effects are postulated to bias the growth of actin filament branches toward the inside of the plasma membrane at the leading edge ( 11 , 12 ) . Steric inter - ference would be the simplest way for PPIs to block interaction of CP with filament ends . Mutation of three residues surround - ing a putative PIP 2 - binding site reduces the affinity of CP for PIP 2 5 – 60 - fold and barbed ends 400 - fold ( 13 ) . Although the binding sites on CP for the barbed end and PIP 2 overlap , disso - ciation of CP from a barbed end by PIP 2 would presumably require an allosteric mechanism . To examine the question of uncapping from a new perspec - tive , we used total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy to observe capping and uncapping of individual filaments in vitro . We obtained association and dissociation rate constants for vertebrate CP in good agreement with those previously measured in bulk assays . We also confirmed that PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 2 sequester CP and prevent its binding to barbed ends . However , none of these PPIs accel - erated the dissociation of CP from filaments . Although PIP 2 inhibits budding yeast CP ( 14 ) , we discovered that PPIs do not inhibit binding of fission yeast CP to filament ends , despite other similarities to budding yeast and vertebrate CPs . This experiment of nature gave us an opportunity to identify an excellent candidate for an alternate PPI - binding site by com - * This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Research Grant GM - 26338 ( to T .

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Proteins We purified actin from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone pow - der through one round of polymerization , depolymerization , and gel filtration ( 15 ) . Actin was labeled with pyrenyl iodoacet - amide ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) ( 16 ) or with Oregon Green 488 ( OG ) iodoacetamide ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) and further purified with DEAE - Sepharose ion exchange chromatography followed by depolymerization and gel filtra - tion ( 15 ) . Before use , labeled and unlabeled actins were dialyzed overnight against fresh buffer G ( 2 m M Tris - Cl , pH 8 , 0 . 2 m M ATP , 1 m M NaN 3 , 0 . 1 m M CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 m M dithiothreitol ( DTT ) ) and centrifuged at 100 , 000 (cid:2) g for 2 h at 4 °C . Recombinant mouse capping protein ( Mm CP ) (cid:1) 1 and (cid:2) 2 subunits were expressed on a single plasmid ( pET3d [ m - (cid:1) 1 / (cid:2) 2 ] ) and purified from bacterial lysates ( 17 ) . We purified recombinant fission yeast capping protein ( Sp CP ) subunits Acap1 and Acap2 expressed on a single plasmid ( pET3a - acp1acp2 ) ( 18 ) . Capping proteins were dialyzed into Ca 2 (cid:3) / Mg 2 (cid:3) - free CP buffer ( 10 m M imidazole , pH 7 . 5 , 50 m M KCl , 1 m M DTT , 0 . 1 m M EGTA , 2 m M NaN 3 ) containing 50 % glycerol , flash - frozen in liquid N 2 , and stored at (cid:1) 80 °C . We determined the activity of a frozen Mm CP stock by equilibrating a range of Mm CP concentrations with actin seeds and then measuring the rate of pyrene actin assembly from capped seeds ( 10 ) . Frozen stocks were 2 – 4 - fold less active than freshly prepared Mm CP . Myosin from rabbit skeletal muscle ( 19 ) was treated with N - ethylmaleimide ( Sigma ) ( 20 ) and stored at (cid:1) 20 °C in 10 m M imidazole , pH 7 , 0 . 5 M KCl , 1 m M DTT , and 50 % glycerol . We estimated protein concentrations from the following extinction coefficients : unlabeled actin , A 290 (cid:4) 26 , 600 M (cid:1) 1 cm (cid:1) 1 ( 21 ) ; Mm CP , A 280 (cid:4) 76 , 300 M (cid:1) 1 cm (cid:1) 1 ( 17 ) ; Sp CP , A 280 (cid:4) 72 , 000 M (cid:1) 1 cm (cid:1) 1 ( 18 ) ; myosin , A 280 (cid:4) 260 , 000 M (cid:1) 1 cm (cid:1) 1 ( 22 ) . For OG - labeled actin , total actin concentration was estimated from the corrected extinction coefficient , A 290 (cid:1) 0 . 17 (cid:2) A 491 (cid:4) A * 290 (cid:4) 26 , 600 M (cid:1) 1 cm (cid:1) 1 , and labeled actin fraction from A 491 (cid:4) 77 , 800 M (cid:1) 1 cm (cid:1) 1 ( 15 ) . For pyrene - labeled actin , total actin concentration was estimated from the corrected extinction coefficient , A 290 (cid:1) 0 . 127 (cid:2) A 344 (cid:4) A * 290 (cid:4) 26 , 600 M (cid:1) 1 cm (cid:1) 1 and labeled actin fraction from A 344 (cid:4) 22 , 000 M (cid:1) 1 cm (cid:1) 1 ( 23 ) . Synthetic D - myo - phosphatidylinositols ( diC16 ) from Echelon Biosciences ( Salt Lake City , UT ) were resuspended in chloro - form , aliquoted into glass vials , dried under vacuum or nitrogen gas , and stored at (cid:1) 20 °C . Before use , we added Ca 2 (cid:3) / Mg 2 (cid:3) - free CP buffer to an aliquot of phospholipid to a final concen - tration of 200 (cid:3) M , incubated at 4 °C for 4 – 16 h to suspend , and sonicated for 5 min in a water bath sonicator and an additional 1 min before each experiment to form micelles . TIRF Polymerization Experiments Crown glass slides were cleaned and prepared as flow cells ( 15 ) . We preincubated each flow cell for 2 min with 0 . 2 (cid:3) M N - ethylmaleimide - inactivated myosin in high salt Tris - buff - ered saline ( 50 m M Tris - Cl , pH 7 . 6 , 600 m M NaCl ) containing a 10 (cid:1) 4 dilution of 200 nm crimson fluorescent microspheres ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) followed for 1 min each with 1 % bovine serum albumin ( Sigma ) in high salt Tris - buffered saline and then 1 % N - ethylmaleimide in low salt Tris - buffered saline ( 50 m M Tris - Cl , pH 7 . 6 , 150 m M NaCl ) . We mixed labeled and unlabeled Ca - ATP - actin to the desired labeled fraction at 4 . 44 (cid:2) the final concentration , mixed 9 : 1 with 10 (cid:2) Mg exchange buffer ( 10 (cid:2) ME : 10 m M EGTA , 1 m M MgCl 2 ) , and incubated on ice for 2 min to form 4 (cid:2) final concentration of Mg - ATP actin . We placed 8 (cid:3) l of Mg - ATP at the bottom of a 1 . 5 - ml Eppendorf tube , and on the side , we mixed 4 (cid:3) l of 8 (cid:2) final concentrations of Ca 2 (cid:3) / Mg 2 (cid:3) - free CP or buffer and 4 (cid:3) l of 8 (cid:2) final concentrations of phospholipid or buffer and incubated at room temperature for 5 min . To start the reaction , we washed both drops together with 16 (cid:3) l of 2 (cid:2) TIR buffer ( 2 (cid:2) : 100 m M KCl , 2 m M MgCl 2 , 2 m M EGTA , 20 m M imidazole , pH 7 . 0 , 200 m M DTT , 0 . 4 m M ATP , 30 m M glucose , 1 % methylcellulose , 40 (cid:3) g / ml catalase , 200 (cid:3) g / ml glucose oxi - dase ) and wicked 16 (cid:3) l through a prepared flow chamber . All subsequent buffer exchanges were similar except that Mg - buffer G ( 9 : 1 mixture of buffer G , 10 (cid:2) ME ) was substituted for Mg - ATP - actin when pre - existing filaments were incubated with CP alone before dissociation experiments . For longer uncapping experiments , we sealed the chamber ends with VALAP ( 1 : 1 : 1 Vaseline / lanolin / paraffin ) to reduce filament breakage because of evaporative loss induced flow . Images were captured once every 6 – 60 s , depending on conditions , for a total of 100 – 200 frames per experiment . Bulk Pyrenyl - Actin Spectroscopy Assay of Growth from Capped Seeds Long Seeds —We mixed Ca - ATP - actin 8 : 1 with 10 (cid:2) ME and incubated on ice for 2 min followed by 9 : 1 mix with 10 (cid:2) KMEI ( 10 (cid:2) : 500 m M KCl , 10 m M MgCl 2 , 10 m M EGTA , 100 m M imid - azole , pH 7 ) for a final Mg - ATP - actin concentration of 6 (cid:3) M . Filaments were polymerized at 20 °C for over 2 h and used with - out dilution . Short Seeds —6 (cid:3) M Mg - ATP - actin was mixed as above , poly - merized for 10 min , diluted 1 : 9 in buffer F ( 8 : 1 : 1 mixture of buffer G , 10 (cid:2) ME , 10 (cid:2) KMEI ) , and vortexed for 10 s on max - imum speed ( Vortex Genie 2 , VWR Scientific Products , West Chester , PA ) . We used short seeds 1 min after vortexing . Aver - age seed length was calculated from [ filament ] / [ ends ] after dilution . Capped Seeds —We gently added undiluted long seeds or freshly prepared short seeds 1 : 1 to a drop of 150 n M Mm CP and incubated for 5 min . Wide - bore pipette tips ( USA Scientific , Ocala , FL ) and gentle pipetting were used in all subsequent mixing steps . Elongation from Capped Seeds —2 . 5 (cid:3) M ( 30 % pyrenyl ) Ca - ATP - actin monomers were converted to Mg - ATP - actin by mixing 10 : 1 with 10 (cid:2) ME on ice for 2 min . Separate drops of capped seeds , pyrenyl - actin , and PPI were mixed together with buffer F for a final 15 - fold dilution of seeds and a final concen - tration of 10 n M Mm CP , 1 . 2 (cid:3) M ( 30 % pyrenyl ) , Mg - ATP - actin , and 24 (cid:3) M PPI . A Gemini XPS fluorescence microplate reader ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) monitored the fluores - cence increase over time with excitation at 365 nm and emis - sion at 407 nm . Capping of Single Actin Filaments SEPTEMBER 21 , 2007• VOLUME 282•NUMBER 38 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 28015 a t Y a l e U n i v e r s i t y on M a r c h 17 , 2009 www . j b c . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Calculation of [ Filamentous Actin ] and [ Ends ] —Scatter from PPI micelles increased the fluorescent signal by a constant amount ( 4 ) . Assuming that the concentration of filamentous pyrenyl - actin was zero at the beginning of the reaction and the polymerization rate was constant for the first 4 min , we used a linear fit of the first 250 s of each polymerization trace to estimate fluorescence intensity at 0 s and subtracted this value . Seeded actin polymerization curves that reached a pla - teau were used to estimate the final fluorescence intensity for [ filament ] (cid:4) 1 . 2 (cid:1) 0 . 17 (cid:4) 1 . 03 (cid:3) M , assuming a critical concentration of K C (cid:4) 0 . 17 (cid:3) M , and for [ actin ] (cid:4) 1 . 2 (cid:1) [ filament ] . We applied these scaling factors to all curves and obtained polymerization rates from the slope of a 250 - s win - dow of data . Using polymerization rate constants of k (cid:3) (cid:4) 12 . 9 (cid:3) M (cid:1) 1 s (cid:1) 1 and k (cid:1) (cid:4) 2 . 2 s (cid:1) 1 ( 24 ) , we estimated the con - centration of ends as [ ends ] (cid:4) rate / ( 12 . 9 [ actin ] (cid:1) 2 . 2 ) . Bulk Rhodamine - Phalloidin Fixation of Filaments Grown from Capped Seeds Avidin - coated Coverslips —Coverslips were cleaned for 30 min with a 1 : 9 mixture of H 2 O - saturated KOH / ethanol , rinsed thoroughly with ddH 2 O , cleaned for 30 min in 2 M HCl , and rinsed with ddH 2 O . Coverslips were coated with 5 % (cid:4) - amin - opropyltriethoxy - silane ( Aldrich ) in 95 % ethanol , 5 % H 2 O , pH 5 , with acetic acid , for 1 h and rinsed thoroughly with ethanol . Coverslips were dried with N 2 gas , coated for 1 h with avidin ( Sigma ) , dissolved to 1 mg / ml in 10 m M Tris , pH 8 , 2 . 5 % etha - nol , rinsed in ddH 2 O , and dried with N 2 gas ( 25 ) . Marked Capped Seeds —We converted 60 % OG - labeled Ca - ATP - actin monomers to 2 (cid:3) M Mg - ATP - actin by mixing 9 : 1 with 10 (cid:2) ME on ice for 2 min . Short seeds ( see above ) were diluted an additional 2 - fold before mixing 1 : 1 with 60 % OG Mg - ATP - actin monomers for 1 min to mark barbed ends . We then mixed the products 2 : 1 with 60 n M Mm CP for 5 min to cap barbed ends . Marked Elongation from Capped Seeds —20 % OG Ca - ATP - actin monomers were mixed 9 : 1 to a final concentration of 8 (cid:3) M with 1 (cid:2) ME on ice for 2 min . To 25 (cid:3) l of 2 (cid:2) buffer F , we added 5 (cid:3) l of 8 (cid:3) M ( 20 % OG ) actin monomers and 5 (cid:3) l of 200 (cid:3) M PPI . 15 (cid:3) l of capped seeds were slowly added using a large orifice tip , and the reaction was incubated for 5 min before the addition of 5 (cid:3) l of 10 (cid:3) M ( 40 % rhodamine - , 60 % biotin - labeled ) phalloidin to label and stabilize filaments . After 5 min , stabilized filaments were slowly diluted 20 – 40 - fold in 1 (cid:2) TIR buffer , and 6 (cid:3) l was added to a slide and covered with an avidin - coated coverslip . Data Collection and Analysis We modified an Olympus ( Melville , NY ) IX - 71 microscope for prism - based TIRF microscopy ( 15 ) . We captured and pro - cessed all images with custom - designed Java plug - ins for ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health , rsb . info . nih . gov ) . Crim - son fluorescent beads at the slide surface acted as autofocus targets ( 15 ) . We traced filaments and created linear kymographs using a custom plug - in for ImageJ ( 15 ) . A maximum intensity search algorithm “snapped” a rough hand trace to the filament center to create a refined filament trace and measure total length . For linear kymographs , the plug - in sub - sampled filament intensi - ties at 1 pixel increments along this refined trace and past both ends and replotted intensities as a single column with horizon - tal position dictated by frame number . We collected length measurements for each filament over several frames and ana - lyzed growth in a standard Excel ( Microsoft Corp . , Redmond , WA ) spreadsheet . Filament length was converted to subunits using 370 subunits / (cid:3) m ( 26 ) . To measure CP association times , we added CP to pre - exist - ing filaments concomitantly with a higher labeled fraction of actin . Once the barbed end growth of a filament was halted , we measured the length from the jump in filament brightness to the end of the filament through several frames . The average of this length , L (cid:1) t , divided by the separately measured linear growth rate , R , gave the time between addition and capping , t c (cid:4) L (cid:1) t / R . To measure CP dissociation rates , we washed CP from pre - existing filaments with 2 chamber volumes of buffer concomi - tantly with a higher labeled fraction of actin . Upon barbed end growth resumption , we traced length of the bright filament seg - ment through several frames and estimated the uncapping time , t u , from the average measured time and length and the separately measured growth rate as t u (cid:4) t (cid:1) (cid:1) L (cid:1) t / R . We estimated the affinity of Mm CP for PPI from the decrease in the apparent association rate constant in the presence of PPI . Assuming that PPI binding decreased available CP by mass action , the ratio of available to total CP , r (cid:4) [ C avail ] / [ C total ] , was determined from the decrease in the apparent association rate in PPI compared with the native association rate , k (cid:3) , as r (cid:4) k (cid:3) , app , PPI / k (cid:3) . The affinity of CP for PI was estimated from K d , PPI (cid:4) [ C avail ] (cid:2) [ PPI ] / [ C (cid:2) PPI ] , or K d , PPI (cid:4) r (cid:2) [ PPI ] / ( 1 (cid:1) r ) . For hidden Markov modeling ( HMM ) of Sp CP association / dissociation , we measured lengths of 10 – 15 filaments per experiment through every frame . A Savitzky - Golay smoothing derivate filter ( 27 ) transformed each length trace L i into smoothed instantaneous growth rates at each time point . These instantaneous growth rates were uniformly high during obvi - ous uncapped states and near zero during capped states . With these instantaneous growth rates as reporters of the true hidden barbed - end state ( capped or uncapped ) , we used QuB kinetic analysis software , available on line ( 28 , 29 ) , for Baum - Welch idealization and to estimate rate constants for capping and uncapping . We assumed a simple , second - order model for cap - ping protein ( C ) binding to Mg - ATP - actin filament barbed ends ( A n ) of A n (cid:5) C 7 A n C REACTION 1 Maximum interval likelihood ( MIL ) analysis of the frequency of durations of all capped or uncapped states yielded a rate , k 1 , for the transition from an uncapped to a capped state , and a transition rate constant , k 2 , for the reverse . At high CP concen - trations , the durations of uncapped states decreased toward the acquisition frequency and were more likely to be hidden , increasing error in the estimation of k 2 . At low CP concentra - tions , the frequency of capping and subsequent uncapping events decreased , increasing error in both k 1 and k 2 . For com - parison across all concentrations , we summed the two transition rates to form a single apparent equilibrium rate ( k app (cid:4) k 1 (cid:3) k 2 ) , Capping of Single Actin Filaments 28016 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 282•NUMBER 38• SEPTEMBER 21 , 2007 a t Y a l e U n i v e r s i t y on M a r c h 17 , 2009 www . j b c . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m similar to the rate for a bulk assay to reach equilibrium . This apparent rate was less sensitive to concentration - dependent error than the either transition rate alone . The association and dissociation rate constants , k (cid:3) and k (cid:1) , were obtained either from the slope and y intercept of the apparent rate versus con - centration or in single [ CP ] experiments from an average over three experiments as k (cid:3) (cid:4) k 1 / [ CP ] and k (cid:1) (cid:4) k 2 . Homology Modeling We aligned multiple CP sequences using the MUSCLE algo - rithm ( 30 ) and submitted aligned sequences to Swiss - Model ( 31 ) for construction and refinement of homology models based on the structure of chicken (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) 1 CapZ , Protein Data Bank code 1IZN ( 3 ) . We calculated electrostatic surface poten - tials with the Adaptive Poisson - Boltzmann Solver ( APBS ) Package ( 32 ) at pH 7 and 50 m M ion concentration . Molecular surfaces were calculated and displayed using University of Cal - ifornia , San Francisco , Chimera ( 33 ) and colored for iso - poten - tial values of (cid:1) 15 , 0 , and (cid:3) 15 k B T / e c . RESULTS Kinetics of Capping and Capping by Mouse Capping Protein — We observed the growth and capping of individual actin fila - ments by TIRF microscopy using muscle actin - labeled with Oregon Green ( OG - actin ) . For example , Fig . 1 A shows a time course of filaments polymerizing in 2 (cid:3) M Mg - ATP - actin mon - omer before and after the addition of 4 n M murine capping protein ( Mm CP ) to the reaction buffer . Straightened kymo - graphs of individual filaments ( Fig . 1 B ) show linear barbed - end growth that was terminated by capping protein . The fraction of capped filaments in a sample followed an exponential time course , consistent with pseudo first - order conditions ( Fig . 1 C ) . As slow mixing occasionally caused a lag in capping during the 1st min of observation , we discarded the first few capping events in these experiments to maximize the “good - ness of fit” to an exponential ( R 2 value ) . The exponential association rate depended linearly on Mm CP concentration over a 20 - fold range ( Fig . 1 D ) , giving an association rate con - stant of 2 . 6 (cid:5) 0 . 1 (cid:3) M (cid:1) 1 s (cid:1) 1 for Mm CP binding to Mg - ATP - actin filament barbed ends ( Table 1 ) . This value is similar to previous measurements in bulk samples of 3 . 5 (cid:3) M (cid:1) 1 s (cid:1) 1 for purified chicken CP (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) 1 ( 4 ) and 6 . 3 (cid:3) M (cid:1) 1 s (cid:1) 1 for recombi - nant chicken CP (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) 1 ( 34 ) .

The rarity of these events precluded analysis of this pseudo - capping . Murine capping protein dissoci - ated slowly from filament barbed ends when we washed out free CP ( Fig . 2 A ) . We interpret the onset of growth as dissociation of Mm CP . Most filaments grew at a constant rate ( Fig . 2 B ) , but a few were re - capped and stopped elongating . The fraction of capped filaments declined exponentially over time ( Fig . 2 C ) , giving a dissociation rate constant of 2 . 7 (cid:5) 0 . 1 (cid:2) 10 (cid:1) 4 s (cid:1) 1 ( half - time of 43 min ) . The ratio of the dissociation and association rate constants gave a K d of 103 (cid:5) 7 p M ( Table 1 ) , similar to previous measurements with bulk samples of 80 p M for chicken capping protein ( 4 , 34 ) . Effects of Polyphosphoinositides on Capping and Uncapping by Mouse Capping Proteins —Polyphosphoinositides bind cap - ping proteins and inhibit capping of barbed ends in bulk sam - ples ( 10 ) . Our observations of individual actin filaments con - firmed that 25 (cid:3) M concentrations of micelles of three different PPIs inhibit the rate of capping over a range of capping protein concentrations ( Fig . 3 A ; Table 2 ) . The dependence of the cap - ping rate on Mm CP concentration was the same in controls and with 25 (cid:3) M PI , but it was 3 . 5 - fold lower in PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , 6 . 7 - fold lower in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , and 6 . 2 - fold lower in PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . Assuming that Mm CP bound to micelles cannot bind filaments and that these rates were lower because of mass action , Mm CP would have dissociation equilibrium constants for PPIs of 4 . 4 to 10 (cid:3) M ( Table 2 ) . Divalent cations such as Mg 2 (cid:3) are thought to inhibit PPI binding to CP either through micelle aggregation ( 35 ) or charge masking . At low MgCl 2 concentrations ( 0 . 1 m M ) , the associa - tion of CP with barbed ends ( Fig . 3 B ; Table 2 ) was 10 - fold slower in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 than at high MgCl 2 concen - trations and 5 - fold slower in PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 . Lowering Mg 2 (cid:3) concen - trations increased the apparent affinity of CP for PPIs to 0 . 4 – 1 . 5 (cid:3) M . CP association with filaments was also slower in PI than in buffer under low Mg 2 (cid:3) conditions , indicating that the phos - phate linking the inositol ring to the lipid moiety may play some role in PPI binding . We used bulk samples to evaluate the concentration of barbed ends available for elongation by pyrenyl actin in 0 . 1 m M Mg 2 (cid:3) . Under conditions where the polymerization rate depended on the concentration of ends , we confirmed ( Fig . 4 A ) that addition of PIP 2 to bulk samples of capped actin filaments increased the concentration of ends ( 10 , 36 ) . Polymerization was faster in PIP 2 and PIP 3 than in PI or control capped fila - ments ( Fig . 4 A ) . The most straightforward interpretation of the high elongation rates is that PIP 2 and PIP 3 promote dissociation of capping protein from barbed ends . However , dissociation FIGURE2 .

In contrast , none of the PPIs uncapped filaments in the microscopic assay ( Fig . 3 , C and D ) . Neither PI , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , nor PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 significantly altered the time course of Mm CP dissociation in either 0 . 1 or 1 . 0 m M Mg 2 (cid:3) in these microscopic assays . Given this difference between the bulk and microscopic assays , we considered the possibility that filaments break dur - ing mixing bulk samples and that PPIs prevent recapping by sequestering free CP . Although we mixed capped seeds with PPIs in bulk experiments slowly and with large orifice pipette tips , any shearing force would potentially break filaments of moderate length or entangled in a network ( 37 ) . To test this hypothesis we compared the effect of PPIs on elongation of long and short capped seeds diluted to a similar concentration of ends ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . The mean length of long seeds was 21 (cid:3) m based on the rate of elongation measured with pyrene actin in bulk samples ( Fig . 4 E ) . These long filaments tended to be entangled in bundles typically longer than 10 (cid:3) m when viewed by fluorescence microscopy ( Fig . 4 F ) . The free filaments in these samples measured 7 (cid:5) 7 (cid:3) m long ( Fig . 4 F ) . The mean length of the short filament seeds made by vortexing polymerized actin was 1 . 6 (cid:5) 1 . 4 (cid:3) m by microscopy ( Fig . 4 G ) and 2 . 7 (cid:3) m by the elongation assay ( Fig . 4 E ) . We used elongation experiments with 1 . 2 (cid:3) M pyrenyl actin monomers ( Fig . 4 , C and D ) to measure the concentrations of un - capped barbed ends over time ( Fig . 4 , C – E ) . Mouse capping pro - tein reduced the rate of elongation of both long and short seeds and thus the concentrations of free ends 10 - fold . Mixing 25 (cid:3) M PI with either long or short capped seeds had no effect on the rate of elongation . Mixing long capped seeds with PPIs increased the elongationrate ( Fig . 4 A ) andthustheconcentrationoffreebarbed ends ( Fig . 4 E ) . These increases were 6 - fold by PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , 6 - fold by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , and 4 - fold by PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , a significant portion of the 8 - fold difference in free ends between uncapped and capped long seeds . In contrast , mixing short capped seeds with PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , or PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 increased the elongation rate only 1 . 4 – 2 . 8 - fold ( Fig . 4 D ) , a small fraction of the average 11 - fold difference in free ends between uncapped and capped short seeds . As these experiments were done side - by - side , we conclude that longer , entangled seeds are more likely to break during mixing than short seeds , and that much generation of free barbed ends is because of filament breakage and sequestration of CP by PPIs rather than uncapping . Because the results in bulk polymeriza - tion assays were similar in buffers containing 0 . 1 and 1 . 0 m M Mg 2 (cid:3) ( not shown ) and because the Mg 2 (cid:3) concentration did not affect uncapping in microscopic assays , we performed all sub - sequent experiments at 1 m M MgCl 2 concentrations .

We elon - gated unlabeled filament seeds with a high mole fraction of OG - actin followed by capping by Mm CP . We diluted these seeds into polymerization buffer with a low mole fraction of OG - ac - tin to learn if any barbed end elon - gated . After 5 min we stabilized and labeled the filaments with rhodam - ine - phalloidin . Uncapped filaments ( Fig . 5 A ) had a characteristic stain - ing pattern of red pointed ends , bright green middles , and dim green barbed ends , whereas capped fila - ments ( Fig . 5 B ) had red pointed ends and bright green barbed ends . Using these criteria , we counted the number of capped and uncapped filament in each condition and ignored broken filaments . In con - trol experiments without capping protein , 88 (cid:5) 5 % of filaments had an uncapped staining pattern . With capping protein , the fraction of uncapped filaments dropped to 6 (cid:5) 3 % . At concentrations of 20 (cid:3) M , neither PI ( 10 (cid:5) 8 % uncapped ; data not shown ) , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ( 11 (cid:5) 4 % uncapped ; data not shown ) , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 15 (cid:5) 4 % uncapped ; Fig . 5 C ) , nor PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( 14 (cid:5) 5 % uncapped ; data not shown ) un - capped the filaments during 5 min of incubation ( Fig . 5 D ) . Thus , the increase in free barbed ends seen in bulk uncapping experiments is un - likely to be due to uncapping .

Short pauses are difficult to detect by time lapse TIRF microscopy , so we could not meas - ure Sp CP association directly . Rather , because capping pro - tein binding to filaments is a stochastic Markov process , we used growth traces of individual filaments and hidden Markov modeling ( HMM ) to estimate the “hidden” capped or uncapped state of each filament at each time point along with the association and dissociation rates of Sp CP at fila - ment barbed ends . We tracked the lengths of 10 – 15 filaments per experiment over time to obtain individual growth curves ( Fig . 6 B ) and their derivatives . Growth rates were linear , but individual length measurements varied by 200 – 400 subunits ( S . E . ) from the expected value because of filament motion . We took the deriv - ative of the growth data for each filament to obtain the instan - taneous growth rate at each frame ( Fig . 6 C ) . Although growth rates were uniform throughout the field for the uncapped state and essentially zero during the capped state ( Fig . 6 , B and C ) , noise in the rate data hindered manual assignment of state tran - sitions . We therefore used the Baum - Welch algorithm ( 38 ) to assign capped or uncapped state to rate traces based on the local amplitude and noise of each segment . We combined sections of obvious linear growth or capping from four filaments to obtain the mean ( amplitude ) and standard deviation ( noise ) of growth rates for each experiment . The Baum - Welch interval detection algorithm used these values , along with an initial estimate of the association and dissociation rate constants to estimate the hid - den capping state of each filament ( Fig . 6 C , bold lines ) . A max - imum interval likelihood ( MIL ) algorithm then used the frac - tional occupancy of each state and frequencies of transitions from capped to uncapped or vice versa to estimate the rates of transition between these two states . Using these new rate con - stants , we reapplied the Baum - Welch interval detection to refine the state occupancies followed by the MIL algorithm to refine rate constants . We repeated this process until the rate constants stabilized . The apparent rate estimated by HMM ( Fig . 6 D ) was proportional to the concentration of Sp CP , giving an association rate constant of 0 . 11 (cid:3) M (cid:1) 1 s (cid:1) 1 and a dissociation rate constant of 3 . 1 (cid:2) 10 (cid:1) 3 s (cid:1) 1 for a binding affinity of 29 n M . To measure Sp CP dissociation rates directly , we grew Mg - ATP - actin seeds in flow cells , equilibrated them for 5 min with Sp CP , and removed capping protein by washing with higher fraction - labeled Mg - ATP actin . We estimated Sp CP dissocia - tion times from the resumption of filament growth as in Fig . 2 ( not shown ) and observed a single exponential dissociation rate constant of 5 . 7 (cid:5) 0 . 1 (cid:2) 10 (cid:1) 3 s (cid:1) 1 ( half - time of 2 min ) . Unlike murine capping protein , 25 (cid:3) M phosphoinositides did not significantly affect the rate of association of 20 n M Sp CP with actin filaments ( Fig . 6 E ; Table 3 ) . We observed the effects of phosphoinositides on Sp CP dissociation by equilibrating fil - aments with Sp CP and then washing Sp CP out of the reaction buffer with higher fraction - labeled actin and 25 (cid:3) M phosphoi - nositide or buffer . The time course of the initiation of regrowth ( Fig . 7 A ) was best fit by the sum of two exponentials as follows : FIGURE 7 .

Capping of Single Actin Filaments SEPTEMBER 21 , 2007• VOLUME 282•NUMBER 38 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 28021 a t Y a l e U n i v e r s i t y on M a r c h 17 , 2009 www . j b c . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m a fast dissociation half - life of 10 – 50 s with an amplitude of 0 . 6 ( Fig . 7 B ) , and a slow dissociation half - life of 2 – 4 min with an amplitude of 0 . 4 ( Fig . 7 C ) . Our analysis assumed that every filament was capped at the start of the experiment , but Sp CP rapidly associated and dissociated from filaments . The fast dis - sociation therefore likely represents filaments that were not capped during the final buffer exchange . As we observed a slow single exponential dissociation in other experiments ( not shown ) , the slow dissociation likely represents the true dissoci - ation rate constant for Sp CP in the presence of phosphoinositi - des . Like murine capping protein , phosphoinositides did not significantly affect fission yeast capping protein dissociation when measured directly ( Fig . 7 C ) or via HMM estimation ( Fig . 6 F and Table 3 ) .

We constructed homology models of capping proteins from several species based on the crystal structure of chicken CP ( 3 ) ( supplemental Fig . 1 ) . Ver - tebrate , insect , and plant CPs have a large area of positive potential on the (cid:2) subunit mushroom “head” ( Fig . 8 A , Lys - 142 , Lys - 143 , and Lys - 181 ) that is absent in fission yeast ( Fig . 8 B , large arrows ) and reduced in budding yeast CPs ( data not shown ) . This large basic patch was proposed as a potential PPI - binding site based on hydrophobic scanning of the CP sequence ( 39 ) and lies on the surface that interacts with the barbed end of an actin filament ( 3 , 34 ) . It is thus a strong candidate to contrib - ute to PPI binding . This basic patch is adjacent to but distinct from a cluster of basic residues in the (cid:1) - tentacle hinge region of many CPs , including fission yeast CP . Mutation of three of the basic residues in the hinge region reduce the affinity of chicken CP for PIP 2 about 4 - fold ( 13 ) . DISCUSSION By directly observing capping and uncapping of actin fila - ments with TIRF microscopy , we obtained association and dis - sociation rate constants for mouse CP very similar to those previously obtained through bulk polymerization assays ( 4 ) . These previous measurements fitted polymerization curves of bulk samples to a simple model of capping without contribu - tions from filament nucleation , breakage , annealing , and pointed end growth , so these side reactions must be negligible in carefully executed bulk capping experiments . We also agree with Schafer et al . ( 4 ) that PPIs appear to uncap filaments in a bulk polymerization assay . On the other hand , PPIs did not uncap actin filaments in either of our microscopy assays . Control experiments provided evidence for an hypoth - esis to reconcile these apparently contradictory observations . We found that mixing can break long capped filaments in bulk samples , thus exposing new barbed ends . In the presence of CP , these barbed ends are rapidly recapped unless PPIs sequester the capping protein . This gives the appearance of uncapping by PPIs . Filament breakage and annealing were not considered in the previous bulk uncapping experiments ( 4 ) , perhaps because they utilized spectrin - actin seeds with filaments of only 13 – 14 subunits ( 40 ) . However , we calculate from the actin polymer concentration and exponential capping rate that half of the fil - aments were at least 4 . 1 (cid:3) m long , 25 % were at least 6 . 2 (cid:3) m long , and 2 % of filaments were uncapped and 16 . 9 (cid:3) m long at the time that Schafer et al . ( 4 ) added PIP 2 in their uncapping exper - iment . Filaments this long were subjected to breakage in our control experiments . Any bulk assay designed to test for uncapping activity must distinguish filament breakage combined with CP sequestration from noncompetitive removal of CP from filament ends . Simi - lar assays using spectrin - actin seeds led to the conclusion that Ena / VASP ( 5 , 7 ) and CARMIL ( 8 ) compete capping protein from filaments , so the uncapping activities of these important CP inhibitors should be verified at a single filament level . We confirmed earlier observations that PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 inhibit capping in vitro ( 4 , 10 ) at the single filament level , but unlike Schafer ( 4 ) , we also found a substantial inhibi - tion of capping by PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . Assuming a bimolecular reaction of Mm CP with PPI and that only free Mm CP participates in capping , the dissociation equilibrium constants for Mm CP binding PIP 2 and PIP 3 are in the range of 5 – 10 (cid:3) M in 1 m M MgCl 2 and about 10 - fold lower in 0 . 1 m M MgCl 2 . Kim et al . ( 13 ) also investigated uncapping by PPIs using TIRF microscopy . They introduced capped filaments into flow cells , then flowed PIP 2 and fresh actin into the chambers , and counted the fraction of growing filaments at 5 - min intervals . With 50 (cid:3) M PIP 2 , twice the concentration that appeared to FIGURE 8 . Homology models of Mm CP and Sp CP reveal a potential PPI - binding site .

Capping of Single Actin Filaments 28022 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 282•NUMBER 38• SEPTEMBER 21 , 2007 a t Y a l e U n i v e r s i t y on M a r c h 17 , 2009 www . j b c . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m uncap filaments rapidly in their bulk assay , only 10 % of fila - ments were growing after 40 min , the half - time for CP dissoci - ation . Even in the absence of PIP 2 , only 12 % of filaments were growing 60 min after CP washout . Based on their estimated dissociation rate constant of 5 . 7 (cid:2) 10 (cid:1) 4 s (cid:1) 1 , 87 % of filaments should have been uncapped within 60 min . This low fraction of growing filaments might be explained if a substantial amount of free CP remained in the chamber to recap barbed ends . Appar - ent uncapping half - times faster than the natural CP dissocia - tion half - time of 40 min were only seen at 150 – 500 (cid:3) M PIP 2 . As filament breakage because of Brownian motion of filaments and evaporative flow are problematic in TIRF assays ( for example , see filaments b – d in Fig . 1 B ) , the life history of every filament must be observed to rule out growth because of filament break - age rather than uncapping . Although we cannot rule out allo - steric uncapping at very high concentrations of PIP 2 , another explanation is that PIP 2 sequestered the remaining free CP and prevented re - capping of uncapped or broken filaments in their assay . Alternatively , insufficient slide blocking after the N - eth - ylmaleimide myosin - II wash step can lead to an overly adherent surface that could block either filament growth or CP dissocia - tion because of nonspecific binding of capped or uncapped fil - ament ends to the glass surface . High concentrations of nega - tively charged lipids could act as an efficient slide blocking agent , allowing barbed ends to grow as they broke or uncapped . As filaments were capped prior to their introduction into flow cells in the study of Kim et al . ( 13 ) , only uncapping would be affected by nonspecific adherence . In either case , ensuring that TIRF microscopy can accurately measure the same CP dissoci - ation rates seen in bulk assays without PPIs is essential for determining the dissociation rates in the presence of PPIs . Uncapping is a possible mechanism to explain how PPIs stimulate the creation of actin filament barbed ends in cells and permeabilized cells ( 9 , 41 ) . However , given our evidence that PPIs sequester CP but do not uncap filaments , PPIs are more likely to generate barbed ends by acting on activators of Arp2 / 3 complex or other mechanisms . These alternatives are consist - ent with the observation that stimulation of Dictyostelium with cAMP generates free barbed ends while increasing , rather than decreasing , CP association with the actin cytoskeleton ( 11 ) . Similarly , mechanisms other than uncapping must be consid - ered to explain the strong bias in the orientation of barbed ends toward the leading edge of motile cells ( 12 ) . Gelsolin can simultaneously sever and cap actin filaments ( 42 ) , but severing activity has never been reported for CP . Fila - ments can break spontaneously while being observed with TIRF illumination . Without CP the new barbed end grows . In the presence of CP some broken filaments grew ( Fig . 1 B , filament d ) but others did not ( Fig . 1 B , filament b ) . Thus capping protein may have a low level of severing activity , although these events may be because of spontaneous break - age followed by rapid capping . Observations on Fission Yeast Capping Protein — S . pombe CP has the most divergent biochemical properties among the var - ious CPs studied to date . Sp CP binds the barbed end of verte - brate actin filaments 30 – 50 times slower and dissociates 10 times faster than mouse CP and is the only characterized CP that is not inhibited by PPIs . These differences provide a win - dow to examine the structural basis of these binding reactions . S . pombe CP has a greater overall negative charge ( (cid:1) 26 . 5 ) at pH 7 . 0 than mouse CP ( (cid:1) 13 . 2 ) , so electrostatic repulsion from neg - atively charged actin and PPIs may contribute to the lower affinities . More importantly , both the positive charge along the actin - binding ( 43 ) surface ( Fig . 8 B , large arrow ) and on the flex - ible , actin - binding (cid:2) - tentacle ( Fig . 8 B , arrowhead ) are substan - tially greater on Mm CP than Sp CP . The larger of these positive patches is also an attractive potential PPI - binding site . First , it is one of the amphipathic sites predicted as a potential PIP 2 - binding site by a theoretical analysis of CP structure ( 39 ) . Second , the absence of this basic patch in S . pombe CP can explain the lack of PPI binding . Third , binding of PIP 2 or PIP 3 to this basic patch would sterically hinder actin binding . Fourth , binding to the barbed end of an actin filament would preclude binding of PIP 2 or PIP 3 micelles to this site , accounting for their inability to dissociate Mm CP from actin filaments . Mutational analysis of mouse CP ( 13 ) identified an inhibitory PIP 2 - binding site flanked by three residues , (cid:1) 1 ( Lys - 256 ) , (cid:1) 1 ( Arg - 260 ) , and (cid:2) 1 ( Arg - 225 ) , near the (cid:1) - COOH terminus . Although triple mutation of all three residues reduced the affin - ity of CP for PIP 2 5 - fold in a tryptophan fluorescence assay and 60 - fold in an activity - based assay , the affinity of the CP triple mutant for filament barbed ends was reduced 450 - fold , compli - cating any interpretation of competition between PIP 2 and barbed ends for CP at this site . Furthermore , these sites are well conserved in fission yeast and are less likely to explain the lack of PPI binding seen here . Further mutational analysis of the large basic patch proposed here and by Smith et al . ( 39 ) would be instructive . Yamashita et al . ( 3 ) proposed another candidate PPI - binding site where residues His - 209 , Arg - 163 , and Lys - 95 of the (cid:2) sub - unit bind two nitrates ( Fig . 8 B ) in the crystal structure of chicken CP . Given the location of these residues below the (cid:1) - tentacle , away from the actin - binding region ( 43 ) , PPI bind - ing at this site would have to act allosterically to affect CP activ - ity . Furthermore , two of these three residues are also present in both yeast species and consequently cannot account for the lack of PPI binding in S . pombe CP . Although mutational analysis of one of these residues , (cid:2) 1 ( Lys - 95 ) , failed to show any effect on PIP 2 binding ( 13 ) , the nitrate - binding site cannot yet be ruled out as a PPI - binding site . Little is known about the links between phosphatidylinositol signaling and the actin cytoskeleton in yeast . Both fission and budding yeast contain functional PI ( 4 ) P 5 - kinases ( its3 in fis - sion yeast and mss4 in budding yeast ) . At the restrictive tem - perature , temperature - sensitive mutations of these PI ( 4 ) P 5 - ki - nases lead to reduced actin cables and disruption in actin patch polarity but not patch number . In contrast , cytokinetic actin rings are normal in its3 - 1 mutations at the restrictive tempera - ture . Given that neither PIP 2 nor PIP 3 affects the interaction of Sp CP with actin and that PIP 2 reduction alters the localization but not the maturation of actin patches , it is likely that PIP 2 acts upstream rather than directly on CP in yeast . The association rate constant for Sp CP fits well with the time course of actin patch formation . Actin patches assemble and disassemble within 20 s ( 44 ) and contain about one CP dimer Capping of Single Actin Filaments SEPTEMBER 21 , 2007• VOLUME 282•NUMBER 38 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 28023 a t Y a l e U n i v e r s i t y on M a r c h 17 , 2009 www . j b c . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m for every two Arp2 / 3 complexes ( 45 ) . Thus , about half of all barbed ends are capped at any point in time . With a cytoplasmic concentration of 1 . 2 (cid:3) M ( 45 ) and an association rate constant of 0 . 04 (cid:3) M (cid:1) 1 s (cid:1) 1 , the half - time for capping would be 14 s . This is a bit too slow to cap all of the filaments during the 10 - s growth phase , so macromolecular crowding may speed up the reaction in the cell . The 2 - min half - time for dissociation of Sp CP from filaments is long enough to protect barbed ends from further polymerization during the 10 - s disassembly phase and some other mechanism must account for the rapid depolymerization .
