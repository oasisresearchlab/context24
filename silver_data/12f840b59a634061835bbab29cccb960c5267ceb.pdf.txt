Previous reports showed that the actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in the plant response to low - temperature stress , but the regulatory mechanism of the actin cytoskeleton in this process is not clear . C - repeat binding factors ( CBFs ) are the key molecular switches for plants to adapt to cold stress . However , whether CBFs are involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton has not been reported . We found that Arabidopsis actin depolymerizing factor 5 ( ADF5 ) , an ADF that evolved F - actin bundling function , was up - regulated at low temperatures . We also demonstrated that CBFs bound to the ADF5 promoter directly in vivo and in vitro . The cold - induced expression of ADF5 was signiﬁcantly inhibited in the cbfs triple mutant . The freezing resistance of the adf5 knockout mutant was weaker than that of wild type ( WT ) with or without cold acclimation . After low - temperature treatment , the actin cytoskeleton of WT was relatively stable , but the actin cytoskeletons of adf5 , cbfs , and adf5 cbfs were disturbed to varying degrees . Compared to WT , the endocytosis rate of the amphiphilic styryl dye FM4 - 64 in adf5 , cbfs , and adf5 cbfs at low temperature was signiﬁcantly reduced . In conclusion , CBFs directly combine with the CRT / DRE DNA regulatory element of the ADF5 promoter after low - temperature stress to transcriptionally activate the expression of ADF5 ; ADF5 further regulates the actin cytoskeleton dynamics to participate in the regulation of plant adaptation to a low - temperature environment . Keywords : actin depolymerizing factor , cold stress , C - repeat binding factors genes , actin cytoskeleton , regulatory mechanism INTRODUCTION Low temperature is a major plant stress factor that causes plant growth delay , stagnation , and retrogression and reduces grain yield ( Dolferus , 2014 ; Zhang et al . , 2019 ) . Over long evolutionary process , plants have created a series of complex mechanisms to adapt to low - temperature stress . Cold acclimation is one of these mechanisms . When plants are exposed to non - freezing low temperatures for a period of time , their tolerance to lower temperatures improves ( Thomashow , 1999 ; Shi et al . , 2018 ) . C - repeat binding factors ( CBFs ) are the key molecular switches in this process ( Liu J . et al . , 2018 ) . CBF1 , CBF2 , and CBF3 , also known as DREB1B , DREB1C , and DREB1A , belong to the AP2 / ERF transcription factor family , which recognizes the C - repeat Zhang et al . CBFs Regulate Actin Cytoskeleton Dynamic ( CRT ) / dehydration responsive element ( DRE ) DNA regulatory element ( CCGAC ) ( Stockinger et al . , 1997 ; Gilmour et al . , 1998 ; Liu et al . , 1998 ; Medina et al . , 1999 ; Thomashow , 1999 ) . Low temperature rapidly induces the expression of CBFs . CBFs further activate the expression of a set of COLD - REGULATED ( COR ) genes ( Chinnusamy et al . , 2007 ; Ding et al . , 2019 ) . These genes generally encode some cryoprotective proteins , reactive oxygen species scavenging proteins , enzymes for osmolyte biosynthesis and photosynthetic membrane protective proteins , which enhance the freezing resistance of plants ( Lin and Thomashow , 1992 ; Jaglo - Ottosen et al . , 1998 ; Liu et al . , 1998 ; Janmohammadi et al . , 2015 ; Bremer et al . , 2017 ) . The maintenance and establishment of speciﬁc structures and highly dynamic changes in the plant actin cytoskeleton are necessary for plant cellular processes , such as cell division , cytoplasmic streaming , and vesicular transport ( Staiger , 2000 ) . The rapid remodeling of actin cytoskeleton is directly regulated by diverse actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) , such as proﬁlin , ADF / coﬁlin , capping protein , villin / gelsolin , formin , and actin - related protein2 / 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) complex ( Staiger and Blanchoin , 2006 ; Qian and Xiang , 2019 ) . Actin depolymerizing factors ( ADFs ) are conserved actin binding proteins in eukaryotes that regulate the actin cytoskeleton by forming more pointed ends and monomer actins via their severing / depolymerizing activity ( Staiger et al . , 1997 ; Hussey et al . , 2002 ; Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ) . The Arabidopsis genome encodes 11 ADF genes , which are divided into 4 subfamilies ( Ruzicka et al . , 2007 ) . Our laboratory reported that the third subfamily of Arabidopsis thaliana ( ADF5 , ADF9 ) have developed new functionalization during the process of evolution . They lost the conservative severing / depolymerizing activity of the family and evolved F - actin bundling function ( Nan et al . , 2017 ) . The other three subfamilies retain the conserved function of severing / depolymerizing activities ( Tholl et al . , 2011 ; Nan et al . , 2017 ) . The physiological functions of plant ADFs were reported in recent years , such as pollen germination , pollen tube polar growth ( Chen et al . , 2002 , 2003 ; Bou Daher et al . , 2011 ; Zheng et al . , 2013 ; Jiang et al . , 2017 ; Zhu et al . , 2017 ) , hypocotyl elongation ( Dong et al . , 2001 ; Henty et al . , 2011 ) , stomatal movement ( Zhao S . et al . , 2016 ; Qian et al . , 2019 ) , innate immunity ( Tian et al . , 2009 ; Porter et al . , 2012 ; Fu et al . , 2014 ; Inada et al . , 2016 ) , and nematode and aphid infection ( Clément et al . , 2009 ; Mondal et al . , 2018 ) . The new function of ADF5 plays an important role in regulating the actin bundling process during certain plant - speciﬁc physiological activities , such as pollen germination , pollen tube polar growth and ABA - induced stomatal closure ( Zhu et al . , 2017 ; Qian et al . , 2019 ) . ADF9 is primarily involved in plant growth and development . Under long - day light cycles , the adf9 mutant showed an early ﬂowering phenotype . Compared to the WT , adf9 had delayed growth , a reduced number of lateral branches and a weakened callus formation ability ( Burgos - Rivera et al . , 2008 ) . Previous studies showed that wheat ADF ( TaADF ) was rapidly and strongly up - regulated under low temperature ( Danyluk et al . , 1996 ) . Bioinformatics analysis and previous reports showed that the expression of ADFs in Arabidopsis thaliana changed under low temperature stress ( Fan et al . , 2015 ) , which suggests that members of this family also participate in the plant response and adaptation to low - temperature stress . However , the physiological function and molecular mechanisms of ADF members after low - temperature stress are not clear . We found that CBFs directly bound to the CRT / DRE DNA regulatory element of the ADF5 promoter to induce the up - regulation of ADF5 expression and ﬁnely regulated actin cytoskeleton dynamics at low temperature and aﬀected the endocytosis rate of the FM4 - 64 - labeled plasma membrane . The present study identiﬁed the molecular module of the CBF pathway regulating the actin cytoskeleton at low temperature , which enriched the physiological function of ADF5 and revealed the potential mechanism of the actin cytoskeleton response to cold stress . RESULTS ADF5 Promotes Basic and Acquired Freezing Resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana The bioinformatics data showed that low temperature treatment up - regulated the expression of ADF5 and inhibited ADF9 expression ( Nan et al . , 2017 ) , which suggests that this subfamily is involved in the plant response to low - temperature stress . To reveal the physiological function of Arabidopsis ADF5 under low - temperature stress , we used three adf5 knockout / gene editing mutants : adf5 - 1 , adf5 - 2 , and adf5 - 3 . Our laboratory previously reported adf5 - 1 ( Zhu et al . , 2017 ) . The adf5 - 2 is a T - DNA insertion mutant ( SALK _ 030145 ) from ABRC . PCR and sequencing showed that two T - DNAs were inserted after the ﬁrst G of the second intron ( Figure 1A ) . RT - PCR showed that the full - length ADF5 gene in adf5 - 2 was not expressed ( Figure 1B ) . The adf5 - 3 was generated by CRISPR / Cas9 technology in which the 236 bp of ADF5 genome was deleted ( 221 to 455 bp after ATG ) and only 21 amino acids were correctly translated ( Figure 1A ) . To verify the phenotype of these mutants under low temperature stress , we ﬁrst used 12 to 15 - day - old seedlings grown on 1 / 2 MS plates for freezing analyses . The results showed that the three adf5 knockout mutants had lower freezing resistance and lower survival rate than WT with or without cold acclimation , and the diﬀerence was statistically signiﬁcant ( Figures 1C – E ) . Ion leakage generally represents damage to the cell membrane under stress , and it negatively correlates with the survival rate of plants after freezing ( Ye et al . , 2019 ) . Second , we used seedlings that grew in soil for 21 days to perform independent freezing treatment experiments and obtained the ion leakage of WT and adf5 with or without cold acclimation . The ion leakage of adf5 was higher than WT under both treatment conditions , and the diﬀerence was statistically signiﬁcant ( Figures 1F , G ) . In conclusion , the results of freezing experiments and physiological data indicate that ADF5 promotes basic and acquired freezing resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana . Low Temperature Can Induce the Expression of ADF5 Through a Partial CBFs Dependent Pathway To verify whether the bioinformatics analysis is correct , we used qRT - PCR to detect the expression of ADF5 in the Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 2 January 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 635533 Zhang et al .

Asterisks indicate statistically signiﬁcant differences ( P < 0 . 05 , one - way ANOVA with a Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test ) . WT at low temperature . ADF5 was up - regulated nearly 10 - fold after 12 h at 4 ◦ C , which indicates that ADF5 is a cold - induced gene ( Figure 2 ) . To examine the transcriptional regulatory factors upstream of ADF5 , we analyzed its promoter sequence and found a CCGAC element at − 231 to − 227 bp and − 472 to − 468 bp sites , which could be recognized by CBFs ( Figure 3A ) . To demonstrate that CBFs are the upstream transcription activator of ADF5 , we used the cbf3 single mutant , cbf1 cbf3 double mutant and cbf1 cbf2 cbf3 triple mutant ( cbfs - 1 ) to detect the induction of ADF5 at 4 ◦ C for diﬀerent durations . The induction amount of ADF5 in the single mutant was lower than that in WT , and the double mutant was further reduced . ADF5 induction was signiﬁcantly inhibited in the triple mutant ( Figure 2 ) .

CBFs Regulate Actin Cytoskeleton Dynamic FIGURE 2 | ADF5 expression is induced by cold in WT , cbf3 , cbf1 / 3 , and cbfs . Ten - day - old Arabidopsis seedlings were treated at 4 ◦ C for different durations , and the leaves were detached for RNA extraction . UBQ10 was used as an internal standard . Data presented are the means ± SD of three independent biological replicates ( * P < 0 . 05 ; * * P < 0 . 01 ; Student’s two - tailed t - test ) . these results indicate that ADF5 may participate in the CBFs signaling pathway . ADF5 Is a Downstream Target Gene of CBFs To further conﬁrm that CBFs bind to the corresponding region of the ADF5 promoter , we performed yeast one - hybrid ( Y1H ) experiment . The results show that CBF1 , CBF2 , and CBF3 bind to the ADF5 promoter ( Figures 3B , C ) . We further mutated the CBF recognition sites on the ADF5 promoter to determine the key binding sites ( Stockinger et al . , 1997 ) ( Figure 3A ) . We found the mutation of the two binding sites recognized by CBFs or the binding sites at − 231 to − 227 bp , CBFs no longer bound to the ADF5 promoter in yeast , but the sites at − 472 to − 468 bp remained functional ( Figures 3B , C ) . These results indicate that CBFs bind to the ADF5 promoter via the CRT / DRE DNA regulatory element at − 231 to − 227 bp sites . To determine the eﬀect of CBFs on ADF5 activation , we performed transient transcriptional activation experiments in tobacco leaves . Because Y1H analysis found that CBF1 , CBF2 , and CBF3 bound to the ADF5 promoter , and their function had a certain redundancy ( Park et al . , 2015 ) , we selected the CBF3 with the strongest binding ability in the Y1H experiments for follow - up experiments ( Figures 3B , C ) . Transcriptional activation analysis showed that CBF3 directly transcriptionally activated the expression of ADF5 in tobacco mesophyll cells ( Figures 3D , E ) . Subsequent mutation analysis showed that the recognition sites at − 472 to − 468 bp did not aﬀect the transcriptional activation eﬃciency of CBF3 to ADF5 and the mutation at − 231 to − 227 bp sites or both signiﬁcantly reduced the transcriptional activation eﬃciency ( Figure 3E ) . The results indicate that CBF3 activates the expression of ADF5 via binding to the CBF recognition sites of the ADF5 promoter at − 231 to − 227 bp . To further conﬁrm that CBFs bound to the ADF5 promoter in vivo , ChIP experiments were performed . Col / pSuper : : CBF3 - Myc was treated at 4 ◦ C for diﬀerent times . Chromatin was precipitated using anti - c - myc antibody magnetic beads . P1 primers containing − 472 to − 468 bp sites and P2 primers containing − 231 to − 227 bp sites were used to analyze the enrichment by qRT - PCR ( Figure 3A ) . The results showed no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the CBF3 overexpression line and the WT at the − 472 to − 468 bp sites at 0 h , but the CBF3 overexpression line was 1 . 3 times more enriched than the WT at the − 231 to − 227 bp sites . After 6 h of low - temperature treatment , the enrichment of WT at the two recognition sites did not change signiﬁcantly , and CBF3 overexpression line showed a signiﬁcant increase that was nearly three times the enrichment at the − 231 to − 227 bp sites ( Figure 3F ) . These results suggest that CBF3 binds to the CBF recognition element of the ADF5 promoter in vivo , and this binding activity is regulated by low temperature . In conclusion , CBFs primarily bind to the CBF recognition sites at the − 231 to − 227 bp of the ADF5 promoter in vivo , and ADF5 is a downstream target gene of CBFs . The Effect of ADF5 on Freezing Resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana Partially Depends on the CBF Pathway To further investigate the genetic relationship between ADF5 and CBFs , adf5 cbfs quadruple mutant was obtained by crossing adf5 - 1 with the triple mutant cbfs - 1 . Freezing experiments showed that adf5 - 1 , cbfs - 1 , and adf5 cbfs were more sensitive than WT under non - cold - acclimated ( NA ) conditions , and the survival rate was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent . The freezing resistance of adf5 cbfs was closer to adf5 - 1 with decreasing temperature and there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the two groups ( Figures 4A , B ) . Under cold - acclimated ( CA ) conditions , adf5 - 1 , cbfs - 1 , and adf5 cbfs were more sensitive to freezing than WT , and their survival rate was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent . The freezing resistance of the adf5 cbfs showed the freezing resistance of cbfs - 1 and there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the two groups ( Figures 4A , C ) . Seedlings grown in soil for 21 days were used for freezing treatment to obtain ion leakage . Under NA conditions , the ion leakage of WT and cbfs - 1 treated at − 4 ◦ C was similar , and there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence . adf5 - 1 and adf5 cbfs had higher ion leakage than WT and were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent . At − 5 ◦ C , the ion leakage of cbfs - 1 increased signiﬁcantly relative to WT . The adf5 - 1 and adf5 cbfs had signiﬁcantly higher ion leakage than WT , and the adf5 cbfs had signiﬁcantly higher ion leakage than adf5 - 1 ( Figure 4D ) . Under CA conditions , the ion leakage of adf5 - 1 , cbfs - 1 , and adf5 cbfs was signiﬁcantly higher than WT . The ion leakage of adf5 cbfs resembled cbfs - 1 , and there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence ( Figure 4E ) . In conclusion , ADF5 positively regulates the freezing tolerance ability of Arabidopsis thaliana by partially relying on the CBF pathway . The Actin Cytoskeleton of the Mutant Was Disordered During Cold Acclimation To determine whether the phenotypes of the adf5 and cbfs mutants are directly related to the actin cytoskeleton , we Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 4 January 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 635533 Zhang et al .

Data presented are the means ± SD of three independent biological replicates ( * P < 0 . 05 ; * * P < 0 . 01 ; Student’s two - tailed t - test ) . observed the actin cytoskeleton morphology in epidermal cells from root transition and elongation zone of WT and mutants under normal growth and diﬀerent durations of 4 ◦ C treatment ( Figure 5A ) . ABD2 - GFP was expressed in all mutants after crossing Col / pUBQ10 : : ABD2 - GFP . The average ﬂuorescence intensity was measured directly . Similar to previous reports , the ﬂuorescence intensity of adf5 - 1 under normal growth conditions was signiﬁcantly lower than the WT ( Zhu et al . , 2017 ; Qian et al . , 2019 ) . The ﬂuorescence intensity of cbfs - 1 was slightly higher than WT , but adf5 cbfs had the highest ﬂuorescence intensity compared to WT , with a signiﬁcant diﬀerence . After 6 h of low temperature treatment , the ﬂuorescence intensity of WT and cbfs - 1 decreased , and adf5 cbfs obviously decreased , but the ﬂuorescence intensity of adf5 - 1 was not changed . There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence among the materials at this time . After 12 h of low - temperature treatment , the ﬂuorescence values of all materials recovered , and there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence among WT , adf5 - 1 , and cbfs - 1 . The ﬂuorescence value of the adf5 cbfs quadruple mutant increased less , and there was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between WT and adf5 cbfs ( Figure 5B ) . We analyzed the actin cytoskeleton density and skewness after diﬀerent time points of low - temperature treatment ( Figures 5C , D ) . Consistent with a previous report , the structure of the actin cytoskeleton in WT was relatively stable ( Shibasaki et al . , 2009 ) , and its density and degree of ﬁlament bundling ( skewness ) were not changed . Compared to WT , the mutants had lower actin cytoskeleton density and a higher degree of bundled actin ﬁlament at 0 h , which corresponded to the function of ADF5 in forming a more stable actin cytoskeleton network ( Zhu et al . , 2017 ; Qian et al . , 2019 ) . After 6 hours of low - temperature treatment , the actin cytoskeleton density in the adf5 - 1 , cbfs - 1 , and adf5 cbfs mutants was relatively changed . However , there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between WT and mutants . The degree of bundled actin ﬁlament was reduced , there was no signiﬁcant Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 5 January 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 635533 Zhang et al .

After 12 h of treatment , the density of adf5 - 1 decreased slightly and cbfs - 1 increased , but there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence compared to WT . The quadruple mutant also increased and was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent than WT . The skewness value of adf5 - 1 increased , and the values of cbfs - 1 and adf5 cbfs decreased . Only the quadruple mutant was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from WT ( Figures 5C , D ) . In conclusion , the actin cytoskeleton structure of WT is relatively stable , but the mutants change signiﬁcantly compared to WT under low temperature treatment , and actin cytoskeleton dynamic process in mutants is aﬀected . The Endocytosis Rate of the Mutants Decreased During Cold Acclimation The dynamics of the plasma membrane are very important for the plant response to stress , and the actin cytoskeleton is important for plant endocytosis ( Baluška et al . , 2002 ; Wang et al . , 2020 ) . Considering the eﬀect of low temperature on actin cytoskeleton dynamics , then to track the endocytosis process , we used amphiphilic styryl dye FM4 - 64 to label epidermal cells from root transition zone and quantiﬁed the cytosol / PM FM4 - 64 signal intensity ratio to represent the endocytosis rate ( Figures 6A , B ) . The results showed that the endocytosis rate of adf5 - 1 , cbfs - 1 , and adf5 cbfs mutants was faster than WT , and there was signiﬁcant diﬀerences between adf5 - 1 , adf5 cbfs , and WT , respectively , but there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in cbfs - 1 . The endocytosis rate of WT , adf5 - 1 , cbfs - 1 , and adf5 cbfs decreased after 6 h of low - temperature treatment , and the diﬀerence between WT and mutants was reduced . There was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between adf5 cbfs and WT . After 12 h of low - temperature treatment , the endocytosis rate of WT and adf5 - 1 increased slightly , and there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between adf5 and WT . The endocytosis rate of cbfs - 1 and adf5 cbfs was further reduced , and Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 6 January 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 635533 Zhang et al .

The values represent the means ± SEM ( n = 60 cells per genotype . * P < 0 . 05 ; * * P < 0 . 01 ; Student’s two - tailed t - test ) . there was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between cbfs - 1 and WT , but not in the quadruple mutant ( Figure 6B ) . The results indicate that the abnormal endocytosis rate of adf5 - 1 , cbfs - 1 , and adf5 cbfs under normal growth conditions may be the reason for their freezing sensitivity . During the cold training process , the endocytosis rate of non - synchronous change in mutants may cause disorders of cold signals and cryoprotective substance transport , which may aﬀect the freezing resistance of the mutants . DISCUSSION Previous reports showed that low temperature disturbed the actin cytoskeleton of plant cells and reduced all cell processes ( Das et al . , 1966 ; Pokorná et al . , 2004 ; Fan et al . , 2015 ) . The present study provided molecular genetic and physiological evidences for ADF5 , which is an ABP that evolved F - actin - bundling function , regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics at low temperature partially via a CBF - dependent pathway . The molecular components of ﬁne regulation of the actin cytoskeleton at low temperature were demonstrated . Cold acclimation reshapes the physiological and biochemical status of cells ( Janmohammadi et al . , 2015 ; Ding et al . , 2019 ) . CBFs are the core regulatory factor in this process and activate many downstream COR genes during cold acclimation ( Shi et al . , 2018 ) . Published transcriptome data revealed that CBFs regulated a number of potential actin cytoskeleton regulatory genes including ADF5 ( Jia et al . , 2016 ) . Previous evidence also showed that TaADF accumulated more in freezing - resistant seedlings ( Ouellet et al . , 2001 ) . Our qRT - PCR data also directly indicated that ADF5 was partially up - regulated by CBFs at low temperature treatment ( Figure 2 ) . Genetic analyses also showed Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 7 January 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 635533 Zhang et al .

The values represent the means ± SEM ( n = 60 cells per genotype . * P < 0 . 05 ; * * P < 0 . 01 ; Student’s two - tailed t - test ) . that the freezing sensitivity of adf5 cbfs was closer to adf5 - 1 under NA conditions ( Figure 4A ) . Under this condition , the ion leakage of adf5 cbfs was higher than adf5 - 1 , and the diﬀerence was statistically signiﬁcant ( Figure 4D ) . These results suggested that ADF5 promotes the freezing resistance of Arabidopsis thaliana via a non - CBF pathway . Under CA conditions , CBFs are the core transcription factors of the cold response pathway , and there are many downstream induced genes . The adf5 cbfs primarily showed the freezing sensitivity and physiological characteristics of cbfs - 1 ( Figures 4A , E ) . In summary , ADF5 promotes freezing resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana partially via the CBF signaling pathway . Moreover , transcriptome data clearly showed that some non - CBF - dependent ABPs were cold regulated ( Jia et al . , 2016 ; Zhao C . et al . , 2016 ) . For example , AtFH16 was downregulated , and FIM4 and CROLIN were up - regulated ( Jia et al . , 2013 ; Wang J . et al . , 2013 ; Ding et al . , 2018 ) . Therefore , coordination of actin cytoskeleton dynamics is an important plant cell process under low - temperature stress . Membrane vesicle transport is a conserved basic cell process in eukaryotes , and it plays an important role in the plant response to stress . Under stress , it is responsible for the correct sorting and positioning of speciﬁc proteins and the stress response ( Rosquete and Drakakaki , 2018 ; Wang et al . , 2020 ) . For example , low temperature reduces the intracellular transport of auxin transporters PIN2 and PIN3 , which aﬀects auxin transport and changes the gravitropism of roots ( Shibasaki et al . , 2009 ) . Recent studies also showed that stable GNOM ARF - GEF - mediated endosomal traﬃcking helped Arabidopsis adapt to low temperature ( Ashraf and Rahman , 2019 ) . The cryoprotective protein RCl2A also depends on clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Wang C . et al . , 2013 ) , and the transport of its homologous protein RCI2B at low temperature is selectively regulated to maintain a normal transport rate ( Shibasaki et al . , 2009 ) . The actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in endocytosis and intracellular transport ( Šamaj et al . , 2004 ; Kim et al . , 2005 ) . Previous studies showed that BRI1 and CRPK1 were essential for the regulation of plant freezing resistance ( Liu et al . , 2017 ; Unterholzner et al . , 2017 ) . BRI1 is internalized by clathrin and sorted by the SYP61 / VHA - a1 endosomal compartment , which also sorts the auxin transporters PIN2 and AUX1 ( Robert et al . , 2008 ) . This process requires coordination of the actin cytoskeleton ( Lanza et al . , 2012 ; Arieti and Staiger , 2020 ) . The number of actin cytoskeletons decreased in the rice vln2 mutant , and the polarity distribution and cycle of PIN2 changed ( Wu et al . , 2015 ) . FH5 - regulated actin cytoskeleton polymerization and elongation processes are necessary for the movement of FH5 - labeled vesicles in Arabidopsis pollen tubes ( Liu C . et al . , 2018 ) . Therefore , the actin cytoskeleton is very important for the integrity of the endocytosis and sorting processes , which ultimately aﬀects the correct positioning and distribution of endocytic cargos and the plant response to stress . However , the processes of vesicle transport and sorting controlled by the actin cytoskeleton under low temperature are rarely reported . The present study showed that the morphology of the actin cytoskeleton in WT was relatively stable consistent with previous reports ( Shibasaki et al . , 2009 ; Figure 5 ) , and its endocytosis rate was reduced during low - temperature treatment ( Figure 6 ) , which may be related to the slowing of molecular thermal movement at low temperature . However , the endocytosis rate in adf5 - 1 had a greater reduction than WT at 6 h , which may be related to the disorder of the adf5 - 1 actin cytoskeleton ( Figures 5 , 6 ) . The endocytosis rate of cbfs - 1 and adf5 cbfs continuously decreased signiﬁcantly compared to WT at low temperature ( Figure 6 ) , which may be due to the inﬂuence of their disturbed actin cytoskeleton and additional regulatory pathways regulated downstream of CBFs . In summary , the damaged actin cytoskeleton of mutants changes the endocytosis rate during cold acclimation and the change in the endocytosis rate is not consistent with WT , in which the distribution , recovery and sorting of receptors and cryoprotective substances on the plasma membrane are directly changed . Therefore , the cold acclimation process of mutants is aﬀected , and the freezing resistance of mutants is reduced .

CBFs Regulate Actin Cytoskeleton Dynamic METHODS Plant Materials and Growth Conditions Arabidopsis seeds were vernalized for 3 days at 4 ◦ C with 2 % PPM - Preservative ( Plant Cell Technology ) and grown on half - strength Murashige and Skoog medium ( MS , PhytoTech M519 ) containing 0 . 8 % agar and 1 . 5 % sucrose for 12 – 15 days at 22 ◦ C with an optical density of 80 – 100 µ mol m − 2 s − 1 under a 16 h light / 8 h dark LD photoperiod . Arabidopsis thaliana Col - 0 and Nicotiana benthamiana were used in this experiment . Mutants adf5 - 1 ( Salk _ 018325 ) and adf5 - 2 ( SALK _ 030145 ) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center . adf5 - 3 was obtained using two speciﬁc Cas9 - cleaved targets of ADF5 to mutate Col - 0 , and this method was obtained from the report ( Xing et al . , 2014 ) . The cbf3 , cbf1 cbf3 , cbfs - 1 , and Col / pSuper : : CBF3 - Myc were obtained from the Prof . Shuhua Yang Laboratory ( China Agricultural University ) ( Jia et al . , 2016 ; Liu et al . , 2017 ) . The adf5 cbfs was obtained by crossing adf5 - 1 with cbfs - 1 . The primers used to identify homozygous lines and for CRISPR are listed in Supplementary Table 1 . The materials for ion leakage measurements were grown on MS plates containing 1 % agar for 5 – 7 days , transferred to soil , then grown at 23 ◦ C , 16 h light / 8 h dark LD photoperiod to an optical density of ∼ 100 µ mol m − 2 s − 1 and relative humidity of 60 % for 3 weeks . Nicotiana benthamiana had similar growth conditions . Freezing Tolerance and Ion Leakage Assays This experiment was performed according to the protocol described previously ( Shi et al . , 2012 ) . Brieﬂy , 12 to 15 - day - old seedlings were used to obtain phenotypes by freezing treatment . For cold acclimation ( CA ) treatment , the normally growing seedlings were grown at 4 ◦ C for an additional 3 days at a light density of ∼ 25 µ mol m − 2 s − 1 , 16 h light / 8 h dark LD photoperiod and transferred to the freezing incubator ( PERCIVAL , LT - 36VLC8 ) for treatment according to the following procedure . The seedlings were kept at 0 ◦ C for 1 h , then decreased by 1 ◦ C per hour until the temperature shown in the ﬁgure was maintained for the corresponding times . Non - cold - acclimation ( NA ) processing was directly performed according to a program . After freezing treatment , the seedlings were shifted to 4 ◦ C , kept in darkness for 12 h , and transferred to a normal growth environment for growth recovery for 3 – 5 days . The survival rate was obtained by calculating the proportion of seedlings that grew new leaves . Ion leakage assays was performed as described ( Guo et al . , 2002 ) . Brieﬂy , seedlings grown for 3 weeks in soil were treated for ion leakage analyses with or without cold acclimation ( 4 ◦ C for 3 d ) . A fully and well - developed rosette leaf was washed with deionized water , and placed in the bottom of a 15 - mL sterile centrifuge tube containing 100 µ L deionized water , then placed in a low - temperature circulator ( SCIENTZ , DC - 2030 ) . After holding at 0 ◦ C for 30 min , a small amount of tiny and pure ice crystal was added to the centrifuge tube , and the temperature was reduced by 1 ◦ C per 30 min until the temperature shown in the ﬁgure and maintained for 1 h . The centrifuge tube was removed and kept in darkness at 4 ◦ C for 12 h . Then , 10 mL of deionized water was added to the sterile tube , and the tubes were shaken at normal temperature for 2 h . The electrical conductivity S1 was measured . After sterilization at 121 ◦ C for 15 min , S2 conductivity was measured after shaking for 2 h . The S0 conductivity of deionized water used in the experiment , and the conductivity S0 ′ after sterilization was measured . The ratio of S1 – S0 to S2 – S0 ′ was used as the ion leakage . RNA Extraction and Real - Time Quantitative PCR Analysis Seedlings grown in a normal environment for 10 days on MS plates containing 1 % agar were used for gene expression analyses with or without treatment at 4 ◦ C . Total RNA was extracted using a MiniBEST Plant RNA Extraction kit ( TaKaRa ) , and total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using M - MLV reverse transcriptase ( TaKaRa ) . qRT - PCR was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq ( TaKaRa ) , and UBQ10 was used as an internal reference gene . The primers used for qRT - PCR are listed in Supplementary Table 1 . Yeast One - Hybrid Assays Yeast one - hybrid ( Y1H ) assays were performed as described previously ( Qian et al . , 2019 ) . Brieﬂy , the ADF5 promoter containing the CRT / DRE DNA regulatory element was ampliﬁed using PCR and cloned into the pAbAi vector . The CRT / DRE mutation sequence was obtained using speciﬁc primers and cloned into the pAbAi vector . The vector was linearized and transformed into the Y1H GOLD ( Clontech ) strain . The full - length CBF coding sequence was ampliﬁed using PCR , cloned into the pGADT7 vector , and transformed into the constructed Y1H strain . Aureobasidin A ( AbA , 850 ng / mL , Clontech ) was used for the reporter gene activation test . The primers used to clone are listed in Supplementary Table 1 . Transcriptional Activation Assays This experiment was performed as described previously ( Qian et al . , 2019 ) . PCR ampliﬁed and cloned the ADF5 promoter sequence into pGWB235 - LUC to construct the reporter vector . The full - length CBF3 coding sequence was ampliﬁed using PCR , and it was cloned into the pBIB - 35s - GWR - ﬂag vector as the eﬀect vector . The reporter and eﬀector vectors were co - transformed into N . benthamiana leaves for transcriptional activation analyses . A reporting vector alone was used as a negative control . Fluorescence of the luciferase and luciferin ( Promega ) reaction was obtained using a Lumazone CA1300B camera ( Photometrics ) . The primers used to clone are listed in Supplementary Table 1 . Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays Under normal growth conditions , seedlings grown on 1 % agar MS plates for 12 days were used in this experiment . The seedlings of Col / pSuper : : CBF3 - Myc and Col - 0 ( without Myc - tag , as negative control ) were treated at 4 ◦ C or not , and a ChIP experiment was performed according to a previously described method ( Ni et al . , 2009 ) .

Visualization of Actin Filaments by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy and Quantitative Analyses of Actin Filament To visualize the actin cytoskeleton , we crossed Col - 0 / pUBQ10 : : ABD2 - GFP ( Tian et al . , 2015 ) with adf5 - 1 , cbfs - 1 , and adf5 cbfs and expressed ABD2 - GFP in mutants for GFP ﬂuorescence collection . Under normal growth conditions , seedlings grown on 1 % agar MS plates for 5 days were treated with or without 4 ◦ C for the duration shown in the ﬁgure for ﬂuorescence acquisition . Images of epidermal cells from root transition and elongation zone were acquired using a spinning disk microscope ( Andor ) equipped with a 63 × NA oil immersion lens , and the Z - series images were captured with the step size set at 0 . 5 µ m ( Zhou et al . , 2020 ) . GFP was excited with a 488 - nm laser and observed using a 514 - nm emission ﬁlter . Images were processed and analyzed using ImageJ . To measure the extra actin cytoskeleton structure , the percentage of occupancy ( density ) and skewness were measured using ImageJ software as previously described ( Higaki et al . , 2010 ; Henty et al . , 2011 ) . FM4 - 64 Labeling and Endocytosis Measurements Under normal growth conditions , the seedlings growing on 1 % agar MS plates for 5 days were treated with or without 4 ◦ C for diﬀerent times then used in this experiment . Seedlings were held on ice for 2 min with 2 µ M FM4 - 64 and stained at 22 or 4 ◦ C for an additional 5 min . After FM4 - 64 washout , dye internalization was imaged using a Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope equipped with 40 × 1 . 3 NA oil immersion lens . FM4 - 64 signals were excited with a 488 - nm laser and observed using a 600 to 630 - nm emission ﬁlter . The endocytosis rate was measured and calculated in ImageJ software as previously described ( Zhang et al . , 2020 ) .
