Many computer scientists have long argued for CS as a core intellectual skill developed as part of all students’ educations [ 7 , 30 ] and this argument has gained substantial traction in recent years [ 10 , 16 ] . The ACM / IEEE CS 2013 Curriculum Guidelines strongly advocate offering “outward facing” courses to non - majors , noting that computing is increasingly essential to other academic disciplines and is rapidly becoming “something [ for which ] any educated individual must possess some level of proficiency and understanding” [ 28 ] . Despite the importance of computing literacy as a core 21 st century skill [ 1 ] , computing is seen as ‘uncool’ [ 12 , 20 ] and approaches to teaching it are often uninspiring [ 20 , 25 ] . Female , African American , and Latino students ( among others ) are vastly underrepresented in computing bachelor’s degrees awarded nationally [ 33 ] . Additionally , similar long - standing underrepresentation issues exist in most introductory - level CS courses [ 21 , 26 ] , though some recent initiatives have shown promise at engaging non - majors in introductory courses [ 26 ] . EarSketch ( Figure 1 ) attempts to increase and broaden participation in computing by creating an engaging and culturally relevant learning experience using an authentic STEAM ( STEM + Arts ) approach [ 18 ] . In contrast to other current practices [ 9 , 23 ] , EarSketch creates a learning environment that students perceive to be authentic [ 15 , 29 ] in that it is both personally meaningful and industry relevant in terms of its STEM component ( computing ) and its artistic domain ( music remixing ) . ( See [ 19 ] for a more detailed consideration of related work . ) It includes a programming environment , digital audio workstation , curriculum , audio loop library , and collaboration tools that enable students to write Python or JavaScript code to create musical remixes .

Figure 1 : The EarSketch web - based learning environment combines a code editor with a digital audio workstation . Figure 2 : A path analysis of the EarSketch theory of change . We describe in this article our adaptations of the EarSketch curriculum and learning environment for use in an introductory undergraduate programming course for non - majors at an open - access four - year college . We discuss changes to the curricular materials and learning environment necessary to adapt EarSketch to the structure of an undergraduate course , the results of a quasi - experimental study comparing student engagement , content knowledge , and intention to persist between course sections using EarSketch and non - EarSketch flavors of the curriculum , and a path analysis exploring factors related to student engagement and intention to persist . We seek to understand if authentic STEAM learning environments like EarSketch have the same potential to engage diverse student populations at the undergraduate level as they do at the high school level and if they can help develop computing literacy for all undergraduates ( regardless of major ) and particularly for underrepresented populations . This research identifies key challenges to integrating the arts into introductory CS courses ( and approaches to addressing those challenges ) ; presents evidence to suggest the significant impact of authentic STEAM learning interventions on student content knowledge and intention to persist ; and hypothesizes an underlying theory of change ( Figure 2 ) to explain the roles that authenticity and personal creativity play in these student outcomes in undergraduate CS courses with STEAM . 2 ADAPTING EARSKETCH TO AN UNDERGRADUATE COURSE 2 . 1 Course and Institution Context Georgia Gwinnett College is a public four - year college with 11 , 000 students that constitute the most diverse student body of any public institution in its state . It requires all undergraduates , regardless of major , to take two Information Technology ( ITEC ) courses . One of the IT courses that fulfills this graduation requirement is Introduction to Programming , the course that is the focus of this research . Designed specifically for non - majors , the course focuses on hands - on programming experience that develops both algorithmic thinking and practical skills applicable to future coursework and careers . To that end , the course has typical introductory - level outcome goals aligned with the ACM IT guidelines [ 17 ] for an introductory Programming Fundamentals course in areas such as algorithmic thinking , software development processes , basic computational concepts ( variables , arrays , conditionals , control structures , and functions ) , and data processing . Approximately 200 - 250 non - majors take the course each semester , taught as separate sections with 20 - 25 students in each section that meet approximately 4 hours per week . All sections of the course are taught with Python . 2 . 2 Online Textbook We originally planned to make minimal adaptations to the high - school level EarSketch curriculum ( which included an online textbook ) for this undergraduate programming course , especially since the high - school curriculum was already aligned with an advanced placement course that shared many of the same learning objectives . However , in order to align the sequencing of topics with that already used in the course as well as to include new learning objectives ( such as data processing ) , substantial changes were necessary . An initial pilot course also revealed that EarSketch needed to be integrated continuously throughout the semester rather than taught as a single module within the course ( as is common with high school EarSketch classes ) . This approach emphasized the relevance of key computing concepts to both music and other domains . Significant changes to the nature and structure of student assignments and projects were also necessary . Unlike most high school CS classes , these undergraduate students did the bulk of their programming assignments outside of class time . We found the need for a greater number of assignments , each smaller in scope and more narrowly focused , in order to facilitate success Paper Session : Interdisciplinary Perspectives SIGCSE’18 , February 21 - 24 , 2018 , Baltimore , MD , USA 976 in out - of - class contexts without readily available help from an instructor or from peers . We developed a new online textbook in which music remixing provided the primary domain and frame of reference for each new computational concept . Each chapter began by introducing new computational concepts through simple interactive ( non - musical ) examples in which students could step through code execution [ 8 ] . This was followed by EarSketch examples in which students could see similar computational constructs used to generate music . Students then completed a series of short , prescribed assignments in which they wrote code or code segments to create specific musical results and finally applied new computational ideas in end - of - chapter projects that were more open - ended and creative . We contend that this balance between short , prescribed assignments to test understanding and longer , open - ended projects to explore those concepts more creatively was critical to effectively integrating an artistic component into an introductory undergraduate computing course . In the closing units of the semester , students completed programming projects in non - musical domains ( like data visualization ) to make explicit the ways in which computational concepts transfer beyond musical domains . 2 . 3 New API Functionality The increased focus of the course on user input and data processing ( as compared to our high school EarSketch curriculum ) necessitated the addition of new API functions to EarSketch itself to support console and file input . Because EarSketch is web - based , we approached implementation of these functions differently than in the shell environment previously used in the course . For console input , students use the standard Python console function but user input is requested via a dialog box in the browser . For file input , since the web application lacks local file system access , we created a new function to retrieve text files via URL . This enables students to easily load files that instructors provide via a courseware site , as well as other data sources they find online or place in personal cloud storage . 2 . 4 Grading and Course Management The large number of “micro” assignments and the open - ended nature of chapter - level projects created challenges for grading and assessment as compared to the non - EarSketch version of the course ( in which most assignments were auto - graded using readily available tools ) . We addressed this problem , which is common to STEAM - based computing courses , with a unique two - pronged approach . For the “micro” assignments , we developed a web - based auto - grader that assesses whether each student’s submission generates the desired musical result , accounts for elements such as randomness and console input as necessary , and quickly displays any scripts that fail the test for possible manual grading . For the open - ended chapter assignments , a peer review system offers high - level assessment of projects while the auto - grading system can be scripted to check for the successful use of different computational elements ( e . g . conditionals , function definitions , etc . ) that may be required by each assignment . 3 STUDY METHODS We conducted a quasi - experimental study across two semesters ( fall 2016 and spring 2017 ) at Georgia Gwinnett College . The study took place within the same Introduction to Programming course discussed in the previous section . A total of 410 students participated in the Fall 2016 and Spring 2017 courses . 337 students ( 82 % ) consented to participate : 180 ( 82 % ) from treatment courses using EarSketch and 157 ( 83 % ) were in comparison courses using the prior iteration of the course curriculum . In place of EarSketch , the comparison curriculum included additional abstract Python content and assignments in domains such as graphics and games . Students were split across sections taught by two different treatment instructors and five different comparison instructors . There was no overlap between treatment and comparison instructors . 3 . 1 Research Methods Student Content Knowledge Assessment ( CKA ) : The CKA was administered to students before and after the course to monitor potential learning gains . This 20 question , multiple choice assessment was originally developed by the team for our research in high school AP Computer Science Principles courses . It was aligned with Computer Science Principles and also with the learning objectives for this course . Retrospective Before / Now Student Engagement Survey : This 43 - item survey was administered to students as a retrospective survey at the end of the course to monitor potential changes in students’ internal characteristics . This instrument , originally developed for our research with high school students , draws scales from [ 31 ] and [ 14 ] measuring computing confidence , computing enjoyment , computing importance & perceived usefulness , motivation to succeed , and computing identity and belongingness as predictor variables and an intention to persist in computing as an outcome variable . The survey is administered as a pre / post retrospective at the end of each study to diminish response shift bias [ 13 ] . The literature in STEM education suggests that these constructs are critical to enhancing the number of underrepresented students who persist in STEM fields [ 31 ] . We developed two additional constructs for the survey to focus specifically on creativity and perceived authenticity . Previous researchers [ 2 , 22 , 27 ] suggest that creativity exists at both the level of the person and place . Person refers to the traits , tendencies and characteristics of the individual who creates something or engages in a creative endeavor . Place refers to the environmental factors that affect creativity . We operationally define , within the context of this study , person as students’ associations of programming with expressiveness , exploration , immersion / flow , originality , sharing , and creative thinking . We operationally define a creative place as a thickly authentic learning environment ( both physical and digital ) that is personally meaningful to the student , reflects real - world activities beyond the school , is authentic to the discipline ( s ) , and integrates assessment into the learning process [ 29 ] . Our theory of change ( Figure 2 ) hypothesizes that EarSketch provides a Paper Session : Interdisciplinary Perspectives SIGCSE’18 , February 21 - 24 , 2018 , Baltimore , MD , USA 977 creative place which , in turn , increases the creative characteristics ( person ) among students ( along with the other engagement constructs ) . We label these constructs personal creativity and authenticity , respectively , in the remainder of this paper . For further details , see [ 24 ] . 3 . 2 Analytical Approach This study utilizes construct averages computed from items on the student engagement survey to assess gains in students’ attitudinal responses from before the course to now . Cronbach’s alphas were computed to ensure that the constructs are reliable . While there is ongoing debate among statisticians regarding the use of Likert items as ordinal or interval scales , researchers assert that Likert scales containing multiple items ( e . g . , constructs ) are more reliable than a single item and can , thus , be treated as interval scales [ 4 ] and can have descriptive statistics as well as parametric tests ( e . g . , t - tests ) applied . Treatment and comparison groups were not statistically different at baseline ( before ) across demographic variables and programming background ; therefore , we analyzed change scores ( post - pre ) within each group to compare the rates at which each group improved . Effect sizes were computed using Cohen’s d and are intended to measure the practical importance of a significant finding as small , d = 0 . 2 ; medium , d = 0 . 5 ; and large , d = 0 . 8 [ 5 ] . More recent analyses of effect sizes in education interventions [ 11 ] encourage educators to focus on interventions with effect sizes greater than a “hinge point” of d = 0 . 4 . 4 STUDY RESULTS 4 . 1 Theory of Change We used a path analysis of treatment students to determine the significance and magnitude of the hypothesized factors in the theory of change model . A path analysis is an extension of a regression analysis and maps connections between hypothesized factors ( see Figure 2 ) . The path analysis indicates significant relationships between authenticity and the six student attitude constructs ( computing confidence , computing enjoyment , importance and perceived usefulness of computing , motivation to succeed in computing , identity / belongingness in computing , and personal creativity ) . Furthermore , the path analysis shows a significant correlation between two student attitude constructs ( importance and perceived usefulness of computing and identity and belongingness ) and the primary outcome variable ( intention to persist ) . We may interpret the path analysis to show that a thickly authentic learning environment ( authenticity ) significantly affects each student attitude construct and ultimately affects students’ intention to persist via importance / usefulness and identity / belonging . In the following sections , we explain these connections further and examine the results by race / ethnicity and gender . 4 . 2 Student Attitudes and Intention to Persist We used descriptive statistics and paired samples t - tests to calculate students’ attitudinal growth from before the course ( before ) to after the course ( now ) for both treatment and comparison groups . As displayed in Table 1 , both treatment and comparison students’ attitudes towards computing were statistically significantly higher from before to now . Treatment and comparison students show comparable gains as demonstrated by the effect sizes . The survey response options are a Likert scale ranging from 1 ( Strongly Disagree ) to 5 ( Strongly Agree ) . We use the following nomenclature to identify significance levels : * * * p < . 001 , * * p < . 01 , * p < . 05 , + p < . 10 ( approaching significance ) . Further , we identify effect sizes as : Large ( L ) : ≥ . 80 ; Medium ( M ) : > . 20 & < . 80 ; Small ( S ) : ≤ . 20 . Table 1 : Attitudinal Constructs , Treatment v . Comparison Treatment Comparison Mean Paired Samples t - test Effect Size Mean Paired Samples t - test Effect Size Confidence Before Now 1 . 90 3 . 31 p < . 001 * * * 1 . 20 L 1 . 87 3 . 06 p < . 001 * * * 1 . 11 L Enjoyment Before Now 2 . 36 3 . 29 p < . 001 * * * 0 . 92 L 2 . 34 3 . 11 p < . 001 * * * 0 . 84 L Importance / Usefulness Before Now 3 . 40 3 . 85 p < . 001 * * * 0 . 68 M 3 . 08 3 . 39 p < . 001 * * * 0 . 56 M Motivation Before Now 2 . 74 3 . 75 p < . 001 * * * 0 . 97 L 2 . 74 3 . 43 p < . 001 * * * 0 . 81 L Identity / Belonging Before Now 2 . 33 3 . 05 p < . 001 * * * 0 . 80 L 2 . 30 2 . 79 p < . 001 * * * 0 . 63 M Intention to Persist Before Now 2 . 33 2 . 82 p < . 001 * * * 0 . 59 M 2 . 33 2 . 55 p < . 001 * * * 0 . 35 M Personal Creativity Before Now 2 . 42 3 . 50 p < . 001 * * * 1 . 07 L 2 . 51 3 . 07 p < . 001 * * * 0 . 63 M Authenticity Now Only 3 . 95 3 . 66 Next , we conducted a series of independent samples t - tests to examine if changes in attitudes from before to now differed between treatment and comparison groups . Overall , the treatment ( EarSketch ) group expressed significantly larger attitudinal gains ( p < . 05 ) on four of the seven constructs : motivation , identity , intention to persist , and personal creativity ( see Table 2 ) . However , if a Holm - Bonferroni correction is applied to Table 2 ( which changes the alpha threshold from p = . 05 to p = . 007 due to seven tests being performed ) , importance , motivation , and identity would no longer be statistically significant , while intention to persist and personal creativity would continue to be statistically significant . Regardless , these results suggest that the EarSketch version of the course may be beneficial in improving some attitudes towards computer science beyond the baseline version of the course .

Independent samples t - test assesses differences in change scores between treatment and comparison groups To understand whether students’ perceptions of the learning environment vary between treatment and comparison groups , an independent samples t - test was used to compare responses to the authenticity construct ( see Table 2 ) . Treatment students ( mean = 3 . 95 ) rated the learning environment as more thickly authentic than comparison students ( mean = 3 . 66 ) and this difference was statistically significant ( p = . 011 ) . 4 . 3 Outcome Variables : Content Knowledge and Intention to Persist Paired samples t - tests were used to assess students’ performance on the content knowledge assessment ( CKA ) across treatment and comparison groups . Both treatment and comparison students showed significant gains in content knowledge from before to now ( Table 3 ) . Gains in content knowledge from pre to post ( Δ ) were significantly greater among treatment students than comparison students ( p < . 001 ) . Similarly , paired samples t - tests were used to assess differences on the intention to persist construct across treatment and comparison groups . Both groups demonstrated significant before to now growth ( Table 1 ) . Furthermore , gains in intention to persist from pre to post ( Δ ) were significantly greater among treatment students ( p = . 006 ) . Table 3 : Overall Content Knowledge Assessment , Treatment v .

We found significant growth ( p < . 05 ) and similar effect sizes across underrepresented minority ( URM ) and majority students in both treatment and comparison groups . URM students in the treatment group had significantly greater gains in intention to persist ( p = . 042 ) and personal creativity ( p = . 017 ) and marginally greater gains in motivation ( p = . 097 ) compared to URM students in the comparison group . Further , majority students in the treatment group had significantly greater gains in enjoyment ( p = . 045 ) and personal creativity ( p < . 001 ) and marginally greater gains in motivation ( p = . 054 ) and intention to persist ( p = . 064 ) compared to majority students in the comparison group . We also assessed content knowledge differences between URM and majority students using independent samples t - tests . We found no significant differences between URM and majority students within the treatment group and within the comparison group . For both majority students and URMs , the treatment group significantly outperformed the comparison group in growth on the content knowledge assessment ( p < . 001 ) . 4 . 5 Results by Gender Along with analyzing differences by race / ethnicity , we also analyzed programmatic effects by gender . Both females and males in the treatment and comparison groups expressed significant ( p < . 05 ) growth across all constructs . Female students in the treatment group expressed significantly greater gains in motivation ( p = . 037 ) and personal creativity ( p = . 004 ) and marginally greater gains in confidence ( p = . 097 ) and intention to persist ( p = . 055 ) compared to females in the comparison group . Similarly , male students in the treatment group expressed significantly greater gains in personal creativity ( p = . 004 ) than male students in the comparison group . For both female and male students , the treatment group significantly outperformed the comparison group in growth on the content knowledge assessment ( p < . 001 ) . 5 DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK The reported results provide preliminary evidence to suggest that students perceive a course using EarSketch to be more thickly authentic than a baseline course , and that this difference influences growth in student attitudes towards computing , some of which in turn influences student intention to persist in computing . They also show that students in treatment sections showed significantly greater gains than those in comparison sections for some engagement constructs ( including intention to persist ) as well as in content knowledge . Males , females , underrepresented minorities , and majority students in the treatment group all had significantly greater gains in content knowledge and in some engagement constructs than their counterparts in the comparison group . Of particular note , personal creativity gains were significantly greater for treatment students than comparison students for each of these four groups . These findings suggest , more broadly , that authentic STEAM curricular interventions in undergraduate introductory computing courses can significantly impact growth in student content knowledge , engagement , and intention to persist across diverse student populations . In integrating STEAM into such courses , curriculum designers and instructors must carefully Paper Session : Interdisciplinary Perspectives SIGCSE’18 , February 21 - 24 , 2018 , Baltimore , MD , USA 979 balance open - ended and prescribed assignments , combine arts - based applications of computing with connections to broader disciplinary and career - based applications , and employ multiple methods ( such as auto - graders and peer grading systems ) to efficiently assess large numbers of students . These findings must be qualified by some important limitations . In particular , the presence or absence of EarSketch was not the only difference between treatment and comparison classes in the study . The treatment instructors were generally more experienced in teaching the Introduction to Programming course , and were also co - PIs on this project ( and the lead developers of the online textbook integrating EarSketch into the course ) . Thus , it is difficult to ascertain how much the differences between treatment and comparison sections can be attributed to EarSketch as opposed to instructor teaching efficacy . The generalizability of these results can therefore only be verified through additional evaluation that attempts to control for such factors . Future work for this project is focused both on continued research and on dissemination . We would like to conduct a quasi - experimental study in which the treatment and comparison course instructors are the same , thus reducing the potential impact of instructional differences between the two groups . We would also like to collect more information on actual student persistence ( not just self - reported intent to persist ) . Finally , we would like to conduct classroom observations , student focus groups , and instructor interviews to see how this qualitative data might help explain the quantitative results . We are also beginning to disseminate the new EarSketch undergraduate curriculum and grading tools . The interactive text is freely available online , as are the auto - grading tools , and a framework for peer grading will be added soon . In fall 2017 , we are piloting the EarSketch version of the curriculum across all sections of the Introduction to Programming course at Georgia Gwinnett College and are beginning to promote its use at other institutions as well .
