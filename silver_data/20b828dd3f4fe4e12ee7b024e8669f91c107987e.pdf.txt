Chemokine - induced T cell migration requires WNK1 , a kinase that regulates ion influx into the cell . However , it is not known why ion entry is necessary for T cell movement . Here we show that signaling from the chemokine receptor CCR7 leads to activation of WNK1 and its downstream pathway at the leading edge of migrating CD4 + T cells , resulting in ion influx and water entry by osmosis . We propose that WNK1 - induced water entry is required to swell the membrane at the leading edge , generating space into which actin filaments can polymerize , thereby facilitating forward movement of the cell . Given the broad expression of WNK1 pathway proteins , our study suggests that ion and water influx are likely to be essential for migration in many cell types , including leukocytes and metastatic tumor cells .

Naive T cells migrate between lymphoid organs in search of antigen , a process that is essential for adaptive immune responses 1 . T cells exit the bloodstream and enter lymph nodes in response to the chemokine CCL21 presented on blood vessel endothelium . CCL21 , acting through the CCR7 receptor on T cells , triggers integrin - mediated adhesion between the T cell and the endothelium . T cells then transmigrate through the endothelium and enter the parenchyma of the lymph node . Here they continue to migrate rapidly in response to CCL19 and CCL21 signaling through CCR7 , now predominantly using an integrin - independent mode of migration to scan antigen - presenting cells for the presence of cognate antigen , a process that is critical for an efficient immune response 2 . Chemokine - induced migration of T cells is characterized by polarization of the cell , with the formation of a pseudopodium at the leading edge of the migrating cell . This structure contains a dense and highly dynamic network of branched actin filaments which is essential for migration 3 . Chemokine receptor signaling at the leading edge through phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) results in activation of RAC1 , RAC2 and CDC42 GTPases which promote actin polymerization and the branching of actin filaments . Actin polymerization pushing at the leading edge in turn provides the motor that drives the plasma membrane forward , resulting in migration . WNK1 is a member of the WNK - family of serine / threonine protein kinases that regulate ion homeostasis in kidney epithelial cells where they promote uptake of Na + , K + and Cl - ions from urine 4 . When activated , WNK1 phosphorylates and activates two related kinases OXSR1 and STK39 , which in turn phosphorylate members of the SLC12A - family of electroneutral ion co - transporters altering their activity . For example , phosphorylation of de Boer et al . 4 SLC12A2 ( NKCC1 ) causes influx of Na + , K + and Cl - ions , whereas phosphorylation of SLC12A6 ( KCC3 ) blocks efflux of K + and Cl - ions through the transporter 5 . Thus , signaling from WNK1 results in a net influx of ions . We previously demonstrated that WNK1 , the only WNK - family member expressed in mouse T cells , is required for the homing of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells to lymph nodes and spleen 6 . Furthermore , we showed that WNK1 - deficient CD4 + T cells migrated more slowly in vivo in lymph node parenchyma 6 . WNK1 - deficient T cells show increased integrin - mediated adhesion , which could have accounted for this reduced in vivo migration speed . However , blocking integrin adhesion further reduced in vivo migration speed , demonstrating that hyperadhesion was not the cause of reduced migration . We also showed that WNK1 - deficient T cells have defective chemokine - induced migration in vitro 6 . We demonstrated that stimulation of CD4 + T cells with CCL21 results in rapid WNK1 - dependent phosphorylation of OXSR1 , which also required PI3K , indicating that CCR7 transduces signals via PI3K leading to WNK1 activation . Furthermore , CCL21 - induced migration was partially inhibited in CD4 + T cells with mutations in Oxsr1 and Slc12a2 or treated with bumetanide ( SLC12A2i ) , an SLC12A2 inhibitor 6 . Taken together , these results lead to the surprising conclusion that CCR7 signaling via WNK1 results in ion influx via SLC12A2 which is required for T cell migration . Thus , a pathway regulating ion homeostasis plays a critical role in T cell movement . However , it remains unclear why ion influx is required for this process . Here we demonstrate that WNK1 pathway proteins and their activities are polarized to the leading edge of migrating T cells . Furthermore , we show that chemokine receptor - induced activation of the WNK1 pathway leads to ion influx and to water influx , with the latter most likely occurring via AQP3 . We provide evidence that water ingress is required for actin de Boer et al . 5 polymerization and migration . We propose that this chemokine receptor - induced water entry generates increased spacing between the plasma membrane and the underlying actin cytoskeleton at the leading edge , which could facilitate the extension of actin filaments , and hence forward migration . Results WNK1 pathway proteins are required for CCL21 - induced migration of CD4 + T cells To understand how WNK1 pathway - regulated ion influx contributes to migration , we analyzed the functional requirement for the pathway proteins in T cells migrating in confinement , to model their migration within lymphoid tissue . Since constitutive loss of WNK1 in mice results in embryonic lethality 7 and T cell lineage - selective loss results in a strong developmental arrest in the thymus with the absence of any mature WNK1 - deficient T cells 8 , we chose to inducibly delete the Wnk1 gene in mature naive T cells , as previously described 6 . We crossed mice bearing a loxP - flanked Wnk1 allele ( Wnk1 fl ) or a deletion of Wnk1 ( Wnk1 - ) to mice with a tamoxifen - inducible Cre recombinase under the control of the ubiquitously expressed ROSA26 promoter ( ROSA26 CreERT2 , RCE ) to generate Wnk1 + / fl RCE and Wnk1 fl / fl RCE mice . Bone marrow from these animals was used to reconstitute the hematopoietic system of irradiated RAG1 - deficient mice ( Supplementary Figure 1A ) . Subsequent treatment of these radiation chimeras with tamoxifen resulted in the generation of mice containing WNK1 - expressing ( Wnk1 + / - RCE ) and WNK1 - deficient ( Wnk1 - / - RCE ) T cells from which we isolated naive ( CD25 - CD44 - ) CD4 + T cells for further study . We imaged the CCL21 - induced migration of these CD4 + T cells under agarose on dishes coated with the integrin ligand ICAM - 1 . We found that in the absence of WNK1 , T cells migrated more slowly ( Supplementary Video 1 , Supplementary Figure 2A - B , Figure 1A ) . de Boer et al . 6 Moreover , whereas WNK1 - expressing cells had a typical extended polarized morphology of migrating cells , WNK1 - deficient cells showed no obvious polarization as measured by increased circularity ( Supplementary Video 1 , Supplementary Figure 2A , B , E ) . To evaluate the function of the WNK1 substrates OXSR1 and STK39 in T cell migration , we generated T cells mutated for both kinases , to account for any potential redundancy between them ( Supplementary Figure 1B ) . Using a tamoxifen - inducible ablation of Oxsr1 , we found that CD4 + T cells deficient in OXSR1 and expressing a mutant STK39 - T243A that cannot be phosphorylated and activated by WNK1 9 ( Oxsr1 - / - Stk39 T243A / T243A RCE ) also migrated more slowly in response to CCL21 in the same under agarose migration assay ( Figure 1B ) . To extend this , we used an inhibitor against WNK1 . WNK463 ( WNKi ) , a selective WNK inhibitor 10 , completely blocked CCL21 - induced phosphorylation of OXSR1 on S325 , a known target of WNK1 activity 11 ( Supplementary Figure 2C ) . WNKi showed a dose - dependent inhibition of CCL21 - induced migration speed and shape polarization , with the extended cellular morphology of migrating T cells becoming more circular at higher WNKi doses ( Supplementary Figure 2D , F , Figure 1C ) . 5 µM WNKi resulted in a maximal inhibition of CCL21 - induced migration and polarization , 0 . 5 µM WNKi partially inhibited migration and polarization , whereas 0 . 2 µM WNK1 reduced migration speed by a small amount but had no effect on polarization . To analyze the role of the SLC12A - family of ion co - transporters which are direct phosphorylation targets of OXSR1 and STK39 and at least five of which are expressed in CD4 + T cells ( Supplementary Figure 2G ) , we made use of both genetic mutation and an inhibitor . SLC12A2 - deficient CD4 + T cells migrated more slowly in response to CCL21 compared to control SLC12A2 - expressing cells , albeit the reduction in speed was smaller de Boer et al . 7 than that seen in WNK1 - deficient cells ( Figure 1D ) . Furthermore , treatment of T cells with an SLC12A2 inhibitor that blocks ion movement ( SLC12A2i ) also caused decreased CCL21 - induced migration speed ( Figure 1E ) . Polarization of the cell , however , was not affected ( Supplementary Figure 2H ) . These results support a role for the SLC12A2 ion co - transporter in T cell migration . We extended these studies to CCL21 - induced migration of CD4 + T cells in 3D in a collagen - I matrix . Again , naive WNK1 - deficient CD4 + T cells , or T cells treated with WNKi or SLC12A2i showed reduced speeds of migration ( Supplementary Video 2 , Supplementary Figure 3A - C ) . Lastly , we asked if the requirement for WNK1 in chemokine - induced migration also applied to activated CD4 + T cells . We found that CXCL12 - induced migration of activated CD4 + T cells under agarose was strongly reduced in the absence of WNK1 , or by its inhibition ( Supplementary Figure 2I ) . Furthermore , in a collagen - I matrix , CXCL12 - induced chemotaxis ( directional movement towards the chemokine in a chemokine gradient ) of activated CD4 + T cells was reduced by inhibition of WNK1 ( Supplementary Figure 2J ) . Thus , like naive CD4 + T cells , activated T cells also require WNK1 for chemokine - induced migration . Taken together , these results show that WNK1 , OXSR1 , STK39 and ion influx through SLC12A2 are required for CCL21 - induced migration of T cells in confinement . WNK1 - regulated ion movement and its requirement for CD4 + T cell migration The above results predict that CCL21 stimulation activates the WNK1 pathway , resulting in Na + , K + and Cl - ion entry into the T cell , and that these ions are required for migration . To directly determine if chemokine stimulation induces ion movement in T cells , we used inductively - coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( ICP - MS ) to measure element concentrations in cell lysates and used these as a proxy for the abundance of ions . This de Boer et al . 8 showed that treatment with CCL21 resulted in an increase in K + ions ( Figure 1F ) . Inhibition with WNKi reduced the amount of K + in the T cells and blocked the CCL21 - induced increase . It was not possible to reliably measure influx of Na + or Cl - ions into the cells for technical reasons relating to high amounts of these ions in the extracellular medium . Thus , CCL21 stimulation activates a WNK1 - dependent pathway that results in K + entry into T cells , presumably in part through SLC12A2 or other SLC12A - family ion co - transporters . To directly investigate if ions are required for T cell migration , we reduced the concentration of Na + and Cl - ions in the medium while maintaining isotonicity . CCL21 - induced migration of CD4 + T cells was substantially reduced as the concentrations of Na + and Cl - ions were decreased ( Figure 1G ) . A similar effect was seen if we replaced Cl - ions with gluconate ( Figure 1H ) . Taken together , these results show that CCL21 stimulation results in WNK1 - dependent ion entry into T cells , and that Na + and Cl - ions are required for migration . WNK1 pathway proteins regulate water entry and cell volume WNK1 - induced ion influx would be predicted to cause water entry by osmosis . In support of this , WNK1 has been shown to regulate the volume of non - lymphoid cells , allowing rapid responses to changing extracellular osmolarity by controlling movement of ions and hence water across the plasma membrane 12 . Thus , we hypothesized that WNK1 - mediated ion influx would cause water entry , which may be required for migration . To determine if the WNK1 pathway regulates water movement in CD4 + T cells , we first measured the relative volume of cells with defects in the pathway using a Coulter principle - based cell counter . CCL21 induced a volume increase in WNK1 - expressing T cells , whereas no such increase was seen in the absence of WNK1 , or if WNK1 was inhibited ( Figure 2A , B ) . Furthermore , WNK1 - deficient or WNK1 - inhibited T cells were about 15 % smaller even in de Boer et al . 9 the absence of CCL21 , indicating a basal homeostatic function for WNK1 in regulating cell volume . It is likely that WNK1 is required for regulatory volume increase , a mechanism by which cells recover in volume after exposure to a hypertonic environment 4 . Mutation of Oxsr1 and Stk39 also caused T cells to become smaller and to no longer respond to CCL21 by increasing in volume ( Figure 2C ) . In contrast , SLC12A2i did not change basal T cell volume , but blocked the CCL21 - induced volume increase ( Figure 2D ) , consistent with this inhibitor having the smallest effect on migration speed ( Figure 1E ) . To extend this analysis , we measured cell volume by imaging T cells migrating in response to CCL21 . This showed that CCL21 induced a volume increase which was blocked by treatment with WNKi , and that the inhibitor also caused a decrease in basal T cell volume , consistent with the Coulter counter data , and in agreement with a role for WNK1 in homeostatic volume regulation ( Figure 2E , F ) . To directly evaluate if chemokine stimulation results in water entry into CD4 + T cells , we used NMR to measure uptake of 2 H 2 O into the cells . Similar to the volume analysis , CCL21 stimulation resulted in an increase in 2 H 2 O in the cell , which was blocked by treatment with WNKi ( Figure 2G ) . Taken together , these results demonstrate that WNK1 , OXSR1 , STK39 and SLC12A2 regulate the volume of T cells in response to CCL21 stimulation , and that WNK1 regulates CCL21 - induced water entry . AQP3 is required for CCL21 - induced T cell migration Water enters cells through aquaporin ( AQP ) channels , a family of 11 proteins in the mouse . RNA - seq analysis shows that naive CD4 + T cells predominantly express Aqp3 and lower levels of Aqp9 and Aqp11 ( Figure 2H ) . To investigate the importance of water movement for T cell migration we used DFP00173 ( AQP3i ) , a selective AQP3 inhibitor 13 . DFP00173 inhibits AQP3 , but not AQP7 or AQP9 ; it is not known if it inhibits AQP11 . de Boer et al . 10 Notably , AQP3i treatment caused a significant decrease in the speed of CCL21 - induced migration of T cells under agarose or in a collagen - I matrix , in agreement with previous studies of AQP3 - deficient T cells 14 ( Figure 2I , Supplementary Figure 3C ) . Treatment with AQP3i also reduced CCL21 - induced polarization as measured by an increase in circularity ( Supplementary Figure 2H ) . Measurement of cell volume showed that like SLC12A2i , AQP3i did not change the basal volume of T cells but eliminated the CCL21 - induced volume increase ( Figure 2D ) . A previous study had also proposed a role for AQP4 in T cell trafficking 15 . Using AER - 270 ( AQP4i ) an AQP4 inhibitor 16 , we were able to show that treatment with this compound also reduced CCL21 - induced migration speed , despite a lack of Aqp4 expression in the RNA - seq data ( Figure 2H , I ) . We conclude that either AQP4 protein is indeed expressed despite undetectable levels of Aqp4 mRNA , or that the AQP4i has off - target effects , perhaps on other AQPs . AQP3 is a channel for H 2 O 2 as well as water 17 . A previous study suggested that AQP3 is required for T cell migration because it facilitates H 2 O 2 influx 14 . To investigate if H 2 O 2 is required for mouse naive CD4 + T cell migration , we treated T cells with 20 U / ml catalase , a concentration sufficient to eliminate exogenously added 1 mM H 2 O 2 ( Supplementary Figure 4A ) . Treatment of T cells with this concentration of catalase did not impair migration in response to CCL21 ( Supplementary Figure 4B ) , implying that H 2 O 2 is not required for T cell migration . It is not clear why our results differ from the earlier publication . However , we note several methodological differences . Whereas we measured migration speed in response to CCL21 under agarose , the earlier publication measured % migration through a Transwell in response to CXCL12 . Furthermore , cells were incubated with 2000 U / ml catalase , 100 - fold more than the concentration we used , which may have off - target effects . Taken together these results show that AQP3 is required for CCL21 - induced migration in de Boer et al . 11 CD4 + T cells , likely as a result of water transport , supporting the hypothesis that WNK1 - regulated water entry is required for chemokine - induced T cell migration . WNK1 pathway proteins polarize to the leading edge of migrating CD4 + T cells To further understand how WNK pathway proteins may regulate chemokine - induced migration , we evaluated the sub - cellular distribution of the proteins and their activities in CD4 + T cells migrating in confinement under agarose . Live cell imaging of T cells expressing GFP - tagged WNK1 , OXSR1 and SLC12A2 migrating in response to CCL21 showed that all three proteins were more abundant at the leading edge of the cell compared to the distribution of GFP only ( Supplementary Video 3 , Figure 3A - C ) . This accumulation at the leading edge was not a function of nuclear exclusion or passive enrichment at the leading edge of the fusion proteins , since nuclear - excluded GFP was enriched in the trailing part of the cell ( Figure 3D - F ) . Furthermore , imaging of fixed cells demonstrated that in migrating T cells , OXSR1 , SLC12A2 and AQP3 are enriched at the leading edge and depleted at the trailing edge as identified by localization of CDC42 and CD44 , respectively ( Figure 3G - H , Supplementary Figure 5A - B ) . To analyze activity of the pathway we imaged the distribution of phosphorylated WNK1 ( S382 ) , OXSR1 ( S325 ) , and SLC12A2 ( T203 / T207 / T212 ) , phosphorylations that indicate increased activity of these proteins 11 , 18 , 19 . Notably , these phospho - proteins were also enriched at the leading edge of migrating T cells ( Figure 3G - H , Supplementary Figure 5A - B ) . The polarization of these WNK1 pathway proteins and their activities was eliminated in WNK1 - deficient or WNK1 - inhibited cells ( Supplementary Figure 6A - J ) . Thus , in T cells migrating in response to CCL21 , WNK1 pathway proteins and their activities accumulate at the leading edge of the cell , implying that CCR7 signaling via WNK1 , OXSR1 and STK39 is likely to lead to localized entry of Na + , K + and Cl - ions via SLC12A2 at the leading edge of migrating T cells . de Boer et al . 12 The WNK1 pathway regulates spacing between the plasma membrane and the F - actin cytoskeleton Migration of T cells requires actin polymerization at the leading edge which results in F - actin filaments pushing forward against the plasma membrane 3 , 20 . To determine if this process is controlled by the WNK1 pathway , we measured total F - actin in CCL21 - stimulated CD4 + T cells using flow cytometry . This showed a rapid CCL21 - induced increase in F - actin which was partially decreased by inhibition of WNK1 and SLC12A2 and by Oxsr1 and Stk39 mutations ( Supplementary Figure 7A - C ) , implying that the WNK1 pathway and ion influx may regulate actin polymerization . Forward protrusion of actin filaments at the leading edge is generated by G - actin monomer addition to F - actin filament tips most likely through a Brownian ratchet mechanism 21 - 23 . Thermal ( Brownian ) motion of both the membrane and the filaments results in a fluctuating gap , and when this exceeds 2 . 7 nm , an actin monomer can be added to the filament tip , thereby extending it . This prevents the membrane from returning to its original position , resulting in incremental forward protrusion . We hypothesized that WNK1 - induced water entry at the leading edge would result in localized swelling of the membrane , pulling it away from underlying F - actin , thereby creating space into which actin filaments can polymerize , a mechanism we term a facilitated Brownian ratchet . To directly test if the WNK1 - induced water movement affects spacing between the plasma membrane and the underlying F - actin , we first used instant structured illumination microscopy , a super - resolution method , to image the plasma membrane and F - actin in CD4 + T cells migrating in response to CCL21 24 . We found that at the leading edge the distance from the plasma membrane to the peak F - actin signal was around 174 nm , whereas at the side of the cell , this distance was around 43 nm , consistent with an increased spacing at the leading edge de Boer et al . 13 ( Figure 4A - B ) , although we note that this increased spacing could also be caused by a wider band of F - actin at the leading edge . Notably , treatment of the T cells with SLC12A2i or AQP3i caused a significant decrease in the membrane to peak F - actin spacing , with AQP3i again having the stronger effect ( Supplementary Video 4 , Figure 4C - D ) . Importantly , we noted a significant correlation between membrane to peak F - actin spacing and cell speed , supporting our hypothesis that this spacing is critical for T cell migration ( Figure 4E ) . Thus , our data suggest that SLC12A2 and AQP3 function are required to maintain a larger membrane to peak F - actin spacing at the leading edge and are consistent with water entry causing increased spacing between the membrane and the underlying F - actin . However , we cannot rule out that the changes in these distances are caused by an altered width of cortical F - actin in the migrating cells which could also correlate with migration speed . WNK1 activity and ion and water influx regulate membrane proximal F - actin at the leading edge Surprisingly , analysis of F - actin in migrating cells has shown that despite greatly elevated levels of F - actin at the front of the cell , there is a lower density of membrane - proximal actin ( MPA ) within 10 nm of the leading edge compared to other parts of the migrating cell 25 . This is possibly due to a reduced load of the membrane on actin filaments at the leading edge , which results in rapid polymerization of actin filaments perpendicular to the membrane . These outcompete a network of filaments at shallow angles , thereby generating a region with lower F - actin density proximal to the plasma membrane 26 . We hypothesized that WNK1 - induced water entry and membrane swelling may contribute to the reduced load and hence lower MPA at the leading edge . To test this , we analyzed migrating T cells expressing two fluorescent probes : MPAct - mCherry ( MPAct ) and GFP - CaaX ( CaaX ) 25 . Both contain fluorescent proteins that are tethered to the plasma de Boer et al . 14 membrane , but MPAct also contains an F - actin - binding domain . Thus , CaaX is evenly distributed on the plasma membrane , whereas MPAct accumulates in regions of the membrane with higher concentrations of underlying MPA that is within 10 nm of the membrane . Hence the MPAct / CaaX ratio is a measure of the distribution of MPA . Analysis of T cells expressing MPAct and CaaX migrating in response to CCL21 , showed that , as expected , the MPAct / CaaX ratio is reduced at the leading edge compared to the side and trailing edges ( Figure 5A - B ) . Notably , treatment of T cells with WNKi , SLC12A2i or AQP3i resulted in a significant increase in MPA at the leading edge , with less polarization of the MPA signal between the front and back of the cell ( Supplementary Video 5 , Supplementary Figure 7D - E , Figure 5C - F ) . Importantly , for these studies we used a low dose of WNKi ( 0 . 2 µM ) which reduces migration speed but still allows cells to polarize ( Supplementary Figure 2D ) . Thus , the activities of WNK1 , SLC12A2 and AQP3 are required to maintain reduced MPA at the leading edge of T cells , consistent with our hypothesis that localized ion influx and subsequent water entry causes the membrane to swell away from the underlying F - actin . WNK1 pathway regulates actin retrograde flow in migrating T cells If WNK1 - induced water entry at the leading edge is required to generate space and hence facilitate the Brownian ratchet mechanism of actin filament growth , inhibition of the pathway should affect the rate of actin polymerization at the membrane . Continuous addition of G - actin monomers at the leading edge of migrating cells results in retrograde flow of F - actin , the rate of which can thus be used as a surrogate for actin polymerization rate at the front of the cell 27 . To determine if the WNK1 pathway regulates this process , we measured rates of retrograde actin flow in CCL21 - stimulated T cells expressing LifeAct - eGFP to visualize F - actin . The cells were imaged responding to CCL21 on PEG - coated glass , an arrangement that eliminates integrin - based adhesion , causing the cell to de Boer et al . 15 stay in place and the F - actin cytoskeleton to slip in relation to the substrate . In contrast to a partial decrease in total F - actin , retrograde actin flow was strongly decreased in WNK1 - deficient or WNK1 - inhibited T cells ( Supplementary Video 6 , Supplementary Figure 8A - B , Figure 6A - B ) . Furthermore , both SLC12A2i and AQP3i partially slowed retrograde actin flow , with AQP3i having the stronger effect . Thus , WNK1 , SLC12A2 and AQP3 function are required for actin retrograde flow , consistent with our hypothesis that ion and water influx influence the rate of addition of G - actin monomers to the growing tips of F - actin filaments at the leading edge . WNK1 - induced water entry is required for T cell migration To directly determine if WNK1 - induced water entry is required for migration , we asked if forcing water into the cells by reducing the tonicity of the medium could rescue migration in WNK1 - inhibited cells . This volume increase in response to hypotonic medium would counteract the defective regulatory volume increase observed in the absence of WNK1 . For these studies we again used a low dose of WNKi to slow the cells down , but still allow them to polarize . Remarkably , while reducing tonicity caused a reduction of migration speed in T cells treated with vehicle control , it increased migration speed in cells where WNK1 had been partially inhibited . This was most effective at 248 mOsm / l , a ~ 15 % reduction of tonicity compared to isotonic medium ( 292 mOsm / l ) ( Figure 6C ) . The hypotonic rescue of migration in WNK1 - inihibited T cells could be due to the increased water entry , or , alternatively , a result of reduced NaCl concentration . For example , since Cl - is an inhibitor of WNK1 12 , 28 , it is possible that the reduced Cl - concentration in the hypotonic medium could lead to reduced intracellular Cl - thereby increasing WNK1 activity and overcoming the effect of a low dose ( 0 . 2 µM ) of WNKi . To distinguish if the rescue of migration was caused by increased water or entry or decreased NaCl , we compared the migration speed of WNK1 - inhibited T cells in hypotonic medium at 248 mOsm / l or in de Boer et al . 16 isotonic medium with the same reduced amount of NaCl but with isotonic osmolarity restored using L - glucose , an inert osmolyte ( Figure 6D ) . Whereas hypotonic medium rescued most of the migration defect of WNK1 - inhibited cells , isotonic medium with reduced NaCl was less effective , demonstrating that water entry is required for T cell migration . One caveat to this conclusion is that , depending on the chloride conductance of the cell , the isotonic medium with reduced NaCl may result in less reduction of intracellular chloride compared to the hypotonic medium . In further experiments , we found that treatment of WNK1 - inhibited cells with hypotonic medium also restored lower MPA levels at the leading edge of migrating cells ( Figure 5C , E ) . Finally , the reduced retrograde actin flow in WNK1 - inhibited T cells was partially rescued when the cells were placed in hypotonic medium ( Figure 6E ) . Taken together , these results support our hypothesis that WNK1 - induced osmotic water entry is required for CCL21 - induced actin retrograde flow and T cell migration . Discussion We show that chemokine receptor signaling in migrating T cells activates WNK1 , transducing signals via OXSR1 and STK39 and the SLC12A2 ion co - transporter which results in ion influx , and subsequent water entry by osmosis , most likely via aquaporins . Importantly , we have been able to directly demonstrate chemokine - induced ion and water entry into the cell and show that these are required for cell migration . Furthermore , we show that the WNK1 pathway is activated at the leading edge of migrating T cells and that since AQP3 is localized to the front of the cell , water may also enter at the leading edge . We show that WNK1 pathway function is required for the reduction in membrane - proximal actin at the leading edge that correlates with cell migration . We hypothesize that WNK1 - regulated ion and water influx at the leading edge is required to cause swelling of the de Boer et al . 17 plasma membrane , allowing it to move away from the underlying F - actin , thereby generating space into which actin filaments can extend and facilitating a Brownian ratchet mechanism that is essential for actin polymerization and hence forward cell movement ( Figure 6F ) . We note that loss or inhibition of WNK1 results in a stronger defect in migration than mutations in OXSR1 and STK39 , or inhibition of SLC12A2 or AQP3 . This may be due to redundancy , with other signaling proteins taking the place of OXSR1 and STK39 or to other SLC12A - or AQP - family members compensating for inhibition of SLC12A2 and AQP3 . Alternatively , WNK1 may additionally regulate migration through pathways other than OXSR1 , STK39 , SLC12A2 and AQP3 29 . Indeed , a high dose of WNK inhibitor or loss of WNK1 results in cells that do not polarize and do not migrate , and whose migration cannot be rescued with hypotonic medium . This implies that WNK1 most likely has an additional function beyond regulating ion and water influx at the leading edge . The importance of membrane protrusion for forward actin polymerization at the leading edge is supported by studies showing that increased load on lamellipodial F - actin results in a dense actin network with many filaments growing at shallow angles to the membrane 26 , 30 . In contrast , decreased load results in increased polymerization of actin filaments perpendicular to the membrane , causing rapid forward protrusion of the leading edge . Our studies suggest a mechanism by which such reduced force may be achieved . We demonstrate that CCR7 signaling at the leading edge of T cells results in localized activation of the WNK1 pathway , which we propose would cause water entry and membrane swelling . This would be predicted to decrease the force on the underlying F - actin network and thereby facilitate forward growth of actin filaments . de Boer et al . 18 For this water - facilitated Brownian ratchet to function , water influx at the leading edge would need to cause a local pressure increase which does not immediately equilibrate across the cell , but stays elevated on temporal and length scales relevant to cell motility . In support of this , mammalian cells have been shown to have the characteristics of a poroelastic solid , resembling a fluid - filled sponge 31 , 32 . The solid phase of this sponge consists of cytoskeleton and organelles whose spatial organization results in pores through which water , small molecules and proteins diffuse . Measurements suggested that in HeLa cells , the solid phase of the cytoplasm has an effective pore size of around 30 nm , which is small enough to slow water flow on time and length scales of 10 - 100 s and 10 µm respectively , consistent with the requirements for cell migration 31 . Given the broad expression of WNK1 33 , similar pathways may play important roles in the migration of many cell types both within the immune system and beyond it . We previously showed that loss of WNK1 slows down the homing of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells to secondary lymphoid organs and impairs CXCL12 - induced migration of CD4 - CD8 - thymocytes 6 , 8 . It will be interesting to extend these studies to activated T cells subsets , such as Th1 , Th2 , Th17 , and to investigate the role of WNK1 - regulated migration in T cell immune responses . More recently we found that WNK1 is required for CXCL13 - induced migration of B cells and their in vivo migration in lymph nodes 34 . Furthermore , previous studies have shown that inhibition of the sodium - hydrogen exchanger NHE - 1 ( SLC9A1 ) or AQP9 decreases fMLP - induced migration of human neutrophils , SLC12A2 inhibition reduces migration of glioma and glioblastoma cells , and knockdown of WNK1 or OXSR1 impairs glioma migration , indicating that ion and water movement may be important for migration in multiple contexts 35 - 38 . Moreover , inhibition of WNK1 was shown to decrease migration of breast cancer cells in vitro and to reduce tumor burden in vivo 39 . However , the mechanistic basis of these observations is unclear . Our results provide a potential de Boer et al . 19 explanation for why ion and water movement may be important for cell migration in multiple cell types , including metastatic tumor cells . More broadly , in a parallel study we have been able to show that T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) stimulation of CD4 + T cells results in the activation of the WNK1 pathway and that the resulting ion and water influx are required for TCR - induced cell proliferation 40 . These results suggest that multiple signaling receptors may co - opt the WNK1 pathway to regulate ion and water movement , which are required for migration , proliferation and perhaps other fundamental physiological processes . In summary , we showed that chemokine - induced migration of T cells requires WNK1 - dependent ion and water influx and we propose that water entry at the leading edge of T cells facilitates actin polymerization and hence drives forward cell movement . de Boer et al . 20 Materials and Methods Mice Mice with a conditional allele of Wnk1 containing loxP sites flanking exon 2 ( Wnk1 tm1Clhu , Wnk1 fl ) 7 , with a deletion of exon 2 of Wnk1 ( Wnk1 tm1 . 1Clhu , Wnk1 - ) 6 , with a conditional allele of Oxsr1 containing loxP sites flanking exons 9 and 10 ( Oxsr1 tm1 . 1Ssy , Oxsr1 fl ) 41 , with a tamoxifen - inducible Cre in the ROSA26 locus ( Gt ( ROSA ) 26Sor tm1 ( Cre / ESR1 ) Thl , ROSA26 CreERT2 , RCE ) 42 , with an allele of Stk39 encoding STK39 - T243A ( Stk39 tm1 . 1Arte , Stk39 T243A ) 9 that cannot be activated by WNK1 , expressing LifeAct - eGFP ( Tg ( CAG - EGFP ) # Rows ) 43 , expressing a tdTomato protein from the ROSA26 locus ( Gt ( ROSA ) 26Sor tm4 ( ACTB - tdTomato - EGFP ) Luo , ROSA26 - mTmG ) 44 or deficient for SLC12A2 ( Slc12a2 tm1Ges , Slc12a - ) 45 or RAG1 ( Rag1 tm1Mom , Rag1 - ) 46 have been described before . C57BL / 6J mice were provided by the Biological Research Facility of the Francis Crick Institute . All mice were maintained on a C57BL / 6J background and intercrossed as required to generate strains with multiple genetically altered alleles . Animals were housed in independently ventilated cages under specific pathogen - free conditions and given food and water ad libitum . All mice were age - and sex - matched within an experiment . All experiments were approved by the Francis Crick Institute Animal Welfare Ethical Review Board and were carried out under the authority of a Project Licence granted by the UK Home Office . Bone marrow chimeras Bone marrow cells from Wnk1 fl / + RCE and Wnk1 fl / - RCE mice or from LifeAct - eGFP Wnk1 fl / + RCE and LifeAct - eGFP Wnk1 fl / - RCE mice or from Oxsr1 + / + Stk39 + / + RCE , Oxsr1 fl / fl Stk39 + / + RCE , and Oxsr1 fl / fl / Stk39 T234A / T234A RCE mice were transferred intravenously into irradiated ( 5 Gy , 37 Cs source ) RAG1 - deficient recipient mice which were maintained on 0 . 02 % enrofloxacin ( Baytril , Bayer Healthcare ) for 4 weeks . In all cases the de Boer et al . 21 sex of the donor and recipient mice was matched . The hematopoietic compartment was allowed to reconstitute for at least 8 weeks after bone marrow transfer . In all experiments , control and experimental chimeric mice or cells derived from them were always sex - matched . In vivo deletion of floxed alleles Tamoxifen treatment of Wnk1 fl / + RCE and Wnk1 fl / - RCE bone marrow chimeras was used to generate Wnk1 + / - RCE and Wnk1 - / - RCE T cells . Tamoxifen treatment of Oxsr1 + / + Stk39 + / + RCE , Oxsr1 fl / fl Stk39 + / + RCE , and Oxsr1 fl / fl / Stk39 T234A / T234A RCE bone marrow chimeras was used to generate Oxsr1 + / + Stk39 + / + RCE , Oxsr1 - / - Stk39 + / + RCE , and Oxsr1 - / - / Stk39 T234A / T234A RCE T cells , respectively . Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 2 mg tamoxifen in corn oil ( Sigma - Aldrich ) on 3 ( Wnk1 fl ) or 5 ( Oxsr1 fl ) consecutive days . Mice were sacrificed 7 ( Wnk1 fl ) or 21 ( Oxsr1 fl ) days after initial tamoxifen injection to harvest T cells . T cell purification and culture To isolate naïve CD4 + T cells , mouse lymph node cells were incubated with biotin - conjugated antibodies to CD44 ( IM7 ) and CD25 ( PC61 . 5 ) ( both from ThermoFisher ) , CD11c ( N418 ) , Ly6G ( RB6 - 8C5 ) , CD8 a ( 53 - 6 . 7 ) , B220 ( RA3 - 6B2 ) and TER119 ( TER - 119 ) ( all from BioLegend ) and CD19 ( 1D3 , BD Biosciences ) , and antibody - bound cells were removed with streptavidin - coated Dynabeads ( ThermoFisher ) using magnetic - activated cell sorting according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . Isolated T cells were rested overnight at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 at 1x10 6 cells / ml in R10 medium , which consisted of RPMI 1640 ( Sigma ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , 100 U / ml penicillin , 100 µg / ml streptomycin , 2 mM L - glutamine , 1 mM sodium pyruvate , non - essential amino acids , 100 µM 2 - mercaptoethanol ( all Sigma - Aldrich ) and 20 mM HEPES ( Gibco ) . de Boer et al . 22 T cell migration under agarose 8 - well polymer or glass chamber µ - slides ( ibidi , 80821 or 80827 ) were coated with recombinant mouse ICAM - 1 - Human - Fc chimera ( RnD , 796 - IC ) at 3 µg / mL in PBS overnight at 4°C . Slides were washed 3x with PBS , blocked with 2 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , and washed 3x again . Agarose gel preparation was adapted from a previously described method 47 . Agarose ( 0 . 5 % , UltraPure Agarose , ThermoFisher ) in R10 - equivalent medium was prepared at 50°C , and , if required , mouse CCL21 ( 250 ng / mL RnD , 457 - 6C ) and inhibitors [ WNK463 , ( WNKi , MedChemExpress ) , bumetanide ( SLC12Ai , 20 µM , Abcam ) , DFP00173 ( AQP3i , 20 µM , Axon Med Chem ) , AER - 270 ( AQP4i , 0 . 25 µM , Tocris ) ] or equivalent amounts of vehicle control ( DMSO , ThermoFisher ) were added , and the mixture immediately plated onto the µ - slides . The agarose was cooled at 4°C for 1 h , and then equilibrated at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 for at least 30 min . To change the osmolarity of the gel , part of the solution was replaced with NaCl - free HBSS to generate a gel of the required osmolarity . For isotonic agarose gels with reduced NaCl , the NaCl - free HBSS was supplemented with L - glucose ( Sigma ) . Osmolarity was verified using an osmometer ( Model 3250 , Advanced Instruments ) . T cells stained with CellTrace Violet ( CTV , 1 µM , ThermoFisher ) were resuspended in a small volume of R10 medium containing propidium iodide ( 1 . 5 µM ) and injected under the agarose gel with a pipette . Cells were acclimatized at the microscope for at least 30 min in a humidified chamber at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 and then imaged every 15 s for 10 min using a Nikon Ti2 Eclipse microscope with an LED illumination system . Images were acquired with a Nikon 20x ( 0 . 75 NA ) Ph2 plan apo objective , at 2048x2048 resolution in 16 - bit using Micro - Manager 48 . Cells were tracked using the FIJI plugin TrackMate 49 . Propidium iodide - containing dead cells , and tracks shorter than half the video length were excluded . To de Boer et al . 23 determine cell shapes , binary images were produced from the CTV signal from one still frame per video stack using the FIJI ‘triangle’ auto - thresholding algorithm . Cell profiles were smoothed using the ‘open’ binary function and particles between 38 and 60 µm 2 were detected with the ‘analyze particle’ tool . T cell migration in a Collagen - I matrix To study T cell migration in a collagen - I matrix a previously described method was adapted 50 . CTV - labeled CD4 + T cells ( 2 x 10 6 cells / ml ) in R10 medium containing rat tail Collagen - I ( 1 . 5 mg / ml , ibidi ) and CCL21 ( 250 ng / ml ) were mixed on ice and plated into wells of a 15 - well angiogenesis µ - slide ( ibidi ) and incubated at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 for 30 min to allow the collagen to polymerize . R10 medium containing CCL21 , propidium iodide ( 1 . 5 µM ) and inhibitors or vehicle control if required , was added to the wells and slides incubated in a humidified chamber on the microscope at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 for a further 30 min . Cells were imaged using a Zeiss LSM880 with an AiryScan detector , a 405 nm laser to excite both CTV and propidium iodide and a Zeiss 10x plan apo ( 0 . 45 N . A . ) air objective . A z - stack consisting of 14 z - slices with an 8 µm spacing were acquired every 15 s for 5 - 10 min . Cells were tracked using the FIJI plugin TrackMate . Propidium iodide - positive cells and cells that were tracked for less than 1 / 3 of the video length were excluded from the analysis . Migration of activated T cells Flat - bottomed multi - well cell culture plates ( Corning ) were incubated overnight at 4 ° C with PBS containing plate - bound anti - CD3 e ( 4 µ g / ml , 145 - 2C11 , Tonbo Biosciences ) and anti - CD28 ( 4 µ g / ml , 37 . 51 , BioLegend ) . Plates were washed with PBS and mouse naïve CD4 + T cells were cultured in the wells at 1x10 6 cells / ml in R10 at 37 ° C . On day 3 of activation , de Boer et al . 24 cells were transferred into fresh plates , stimulated daily with 20 ng / mL recombinant IL - 2 ( PeproTech ) and used on day 5 of activation . Under agarose migration assays were run as previously described , except using 250 ng / mL CXCL12 ( R & D Systems , 460 - SD - 01 / CF ) instead of CCL21 . Chemotaxis assays were run according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( ibidi µ - slide chemotaxis , 80326 ) using CXCL12 as a chemoattractant . Briefly , cells were suspended in a 3D 1 . 5 mg / mL rat - tail collagen - I matrix in the observation area of the slide . Chemotaxis chambers reservoirs were loaded and cells were imaged for 1 h using a Nikon Ti2 Eclipse and a 20x ( 0 . 75 NA ) Ph2 objective at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . Immunoblotting Mouse naïve CD4 + cells were rested in T cell media for > 3 h . 2 - 4 x 10 6 cells per condition were preincubated with vehicle control or WNKi for 30 min at 37°C . Cells were stimulated with 250 ng / mL CCL21 for the indicated amount of time . Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer ( 50 mM Tris , 150mM NaCl , 50mM NaF , 5mM dithiothreitol , 2mM EDTA , 2mM Na 4 P 2 O 7 , 1mM Na 3 VO 4 , 1 % Triton X100 , 0 . 5 % deoxycholate , 0 . 1 % , sodium dodecyl sulphate ( SDS ) , 5 mM dithiothreitol , 1x PhoStop ( Roche ) , 1x complete protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) ) for 15 min on ice . Samples were pelleted at 16000xG for 10 min at 4°C . Lysates were diluted in SDS sample buffer ( 0 . 2 M Tris - HCl , 3 % SDS , 10 % glycerol , 3 % 2 - mercaptoethanol , 0 . 25 % bromophenol blue ) and heated at 95°C for 5 minutes . Lysates were analysed by electrophoresis on 4 - 20 % SDS - PAGE gels at 120V for 1 h in Tris - Glycine - SDS running buffer . Separated proteins were transferred to methanol - activated PVDF membranes using Turboblot transfer ( BioRad ) . Membranes were blocked for 90 minutes in Li - Cor Odyssey Blocking buffer . Primary antibodies ( anti - pOXSR1 de Boer et al . 25 polyclonal , MRC - PPU Dundee ; anti - ERK2 , Cell Signalling Technologies , 9108 ) were diluted in Li - Cor buffer at 1 : 500 dilution and incubated overnight at 4°C . Membranes were washed 3x in PBS + 0 . 1 % Tween20 ( PBST ) . Membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies [ α - sheep IgG ( H + L ) AlexaFluor 680 and α - rabbit IgG ( H + L ) WesternDot 800 ( both Invigrogen ) ] at 1 : 1000 at room temperature for 1 h , washed in PBST and imaged using Li - Cor CLx . Blots were analyzed on ImageStudio . Determination of element concentrations using inductively - coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( ICP - MS ) ICP - MS samples were prepared using a protocol adapted from Stangherlin et al 51 . T cells were rested overnight in R10 medium . Cells were pre - treated with inhibitor or vehicle in R10 for at least 20 min at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . Following pre - treatment , cells were stimulated with CCL21 ( 250 ng / mL final concentration ) or medium only for 10 min at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . Cells were washed twice in ice - cold iso - osmotic wash buffer ( 300 mM sucrose , 10 mM Tris base , 1 mM EDTA in purified water , pH 7 . 4 adjusted with acetic acid [ Fluka ] ) . Cell pellets were digested in trace metal grade concentrated nitric acid ( 67 – 69 % w / w ) for 15 min at room temperature , diluted using purified water with a resistivity ≥ 18 . 2 MΩ cm from a Milli - Q system ( Merck Millipore ) and then spiked with either gallium ( Ga ) or cerium ( Ce ) . Sample measurements were conducted at two institutes . At the London Metallomics Facility at King’s College London , samples were analyzed on a Thermo Scientific iCAP TQ Inductively Coupled Plasma Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer ( ICP - QMS ) operating in Dynamic Reaction Cell ( DRC ) mode with oxygen as the reaction gas . The introduction system to the instrument was a Cetac ASX - 520 autosampler coupled to a MicroMist nebulizer that was fitted to a quartz cyclonic spray chamber . Data reduction involved the normalization of raw intensities using Ga as an internal standard , then blank correcting the signal by removing the average analyte intensity of repeat blank de Boer et al . 26 measurements and applying external standardization using a six - point calibration curve to convert the corrected intensities into concentration measurements . At the Department of Earth Sciences , University of Cambridge , samples were analyzed using a Perkin Elmer Nexion 350D ICP - MS and analyte intensities were normalized based on cerium ( Ce ) ( Romil , E3CE # ) . For each sample , element concentrations were normalized to cell numbers . Data from the two measurement sites were combined by normalizing element concentrations to unstimulated control cells . NaCl reduction and Cl replacement To generate media of varying NaCl compositions , NaCl - free RPMI was supplemented with additional NaCl ( Honeywell , S9888 ) . To make the medium isotonic , the remaining difference in osmolarity ( up to 300 mOsm / L ) was made up using D - sorbitol ( Sigma , S1876 ) , an inert osmolyte . Osmolarity was verified using an osmometer ( Model 3250 , Advanced Instruments ) . To generate medium with reduced Cl concentration , NaCl - free RPMI was made isotonic through the addition of Na gluconate ( Sigma , S2054 - 100G ) . Media was supplemented with 0 . 5 % BSA and propidium iodide ( 1 . 5 µM ) . CTV - stained T cells were suspended in medium containing 250 ng / mL CCL21 , allowed to adhere for 1 h at 37°C and imaged on a Nikon Ti2 Eclipse widefield microscope using a 20x ( 0 . 75 NA ) Ph2 objective at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 .

Cells were resuspended in CASYton fluid ( Cambridge Bioscience ) and median cell volumes measured using the Coulter counter principle on a CASY cell counter ( Cambridge Bioscience ) . de Boer et al . 27 Alternatively , cell volume was determined using microscopy . Naïve CD4 T cells purified from ROSA - mTmG mice expressing tdTomato - CAAX to visualize the plasma membrane were imaged in glass 8 - well µ - slides ( ibidi , 80827 ) coated with ICAM - 1 ( 3 µg / mL ) in phenol red - free RPMI supplemented with 10 % FCS . Cells were treated with WNKi or vehicle control and stimulated with 250 ng / mL CCL21 and rested on the microscope for 30 min prior to imaging . Cells were imaged using instant structural illumination microscopy ( iSIM ) using an iSIM microscope ( VisiTech ) with an Olympus 150x TIRF apo ( 1 . 45 NA ) oil - immersion objective . Cells were excited using 552 nm wavelength laser , with emission detected using an sCMOS camera ( Prime BSI Express , Teledyne Photometrics ) . Cells were either imaged for 2 min every 15 s or acquired as a still frame . Resulting images were deconvoluted using Microvolution algorithms in µ - Manager . Cell volume was calculated by generating a mask of plasma membrane edges and summing up the areas of individual z - slices in each cell measured using the ‘analyze particles’ function in FIJI . 2 H 2 O uptake assay T cells were rested overnight in R10 medium . Cells from one biological replicate were divided into four conditions and pre - treated with inhibitor in H 2 O - based R10 for at least 20 min at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . Following pre - treatment , cells were stimulated with 250 ng / mL CCL21 in 2 H 2 O - based R10 ( deuterium oxide , Sigma - Aldrich , 435767 ) containing vehicle or WNKi . Cells were washed twice in ice - cold H 2 O - based PBS and lysed using lysis buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % NP40 in ultrapure H 2 O containing 1 : 500 uniformly 2 H - labelled 1 , 4 - dioxane - d 8 [ Sigma Aldrich , 186406 ] as an internal standard ) for 20 min at room temperature . Lysate supernatants were measured using nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy ( Bruker Advance III HD 700 equipped with a 5 mm QCI cryoprobe ) at 25ºC employing 3 mm NMR tubes . Fully - relaxed one - dimensional 2 H spectra were recorded in the absence of field - frequency lock using a 30° excitation pulse , 8 s de Boer et al . 28 relaxation delay , 20 ppm sweep width , 1 . 6 s acquisition time , 2 dummy scans and 16 accumulated transitions ( total experiment time 3 min per sample ) . Data processing in Bruker Topspin 3 . 6 employed zero - filling to 128K points , 4 Hz line - broadening , Fourier transformation and baseline correction . For each sample , the peak integral of the 2 H resonance of 2 H 2 O was normalized to the that of the 2 H - labelled 1 , 4 - dioxane . Catalase treatment To determine the efficacy of catalase treatment , mouse naïve CD4 + T cells were loaded with DCFDA ( ab113851 , Abcam ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Cells were pre - treated with bovine liver catalase ( C40 , Sigma Aldrich ) for 30 min at the indicated concentrations . Cells were treated with 1 mM H 2 O 2 for 30 min at room temperature , and DCFDA fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry ( LSRFortessa X - 20 , BD Biosciences ) . For migration experiments , overnight rested mouse naïve CD4 + T cells were pre - treated with 20 U / mL catalase in R10 for at least 30 min . Cells were injected under agarose containing 20 U / mL catalase and CCL21 in 8 - well dishes coated in ICAM - 1 , as described in other experiments . Cells were rested for 30 min at the microscope prior to imaging as described above . Generation of CD4 + T cells expressing GFP - WNK1 , GFP - OXSR1 and GFP - SLC12A2 DNA fragments encoding open reading frames for GFP - WNK1 , GFP - OXSR1 and GFP - SLC12A2 were inserted into the MIGR1 retroviral vector 52 , replacing the IRES - GFP sequence , such that fusion proteins were expressed from the 5 ' LTR of the vector . In all cases the eGFP was fused in - frame to the N - terminus of the human WNK pathway de Boer et al . 29 proteins . The GFP - WNK1 and GFP - SLC12A2 constructs were generated by the MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit . All constructs were validated by DNA sequencing . Plasmid DNA for MIGR1 vectors expressing GFP - WNK1 , GFP - OXSR1 or GFP - SLC12A2 and MIGR1 expressing GFP only were transfected into PlatE cells 53 to generate medium containing infectious retrovirus . This was used to infect bone marrow cells from C57BL / 6J mice that were in turn used to reconstitute irradiated ( 5 Gy , 37 Cs source ) RAG1 - deficient mice as previously described 54 . Live cell imaging of T cells expressing WNK1 pathway proteins CD4 + T cells expressing GFP - tagged WNK1 pathway proteins were purified from lymph nodes of bone marrow chimeras by flow cytometric sorting for GFP + T cells . Sorted cells were incubated overnight in R10 medium at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 and then injected under agarose in an 8 - well plastic bottom µ - slide containing CCL21 as described earlier . Cells were placed in a humidified chamber at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 on a Zeiss LSM 880 inverted microscope for 30 min , and then imaged by confocal microscopy with a 63x plan apo ( 1 . 4 N . A . ) oil - immersion objective . Cells were imaged every 15 s for 5 min in a single z - plane proximal to the coverslip . To determine the localization of GFP or GFP - tagged proteins in migrating T cells we used the FIJI plugin VirusTracker 55 . The plugin detects the direction of migration and was set to capture a 20 µm - long region of interest along the length of the cell . Images of these cell shapes were projected on top of each other using the mean intensity projection option . To image nuclear - excluded GFP , mouse naïve CD4 + T cells were transfected with p8xEGFP - N1 ( Addgene # 122168 , gift from Georg Mayr ) which expresses 8 concatemeric EGFP proteins , resulting in nuclear exclusion . Cells were electroporated using the X - 001 de Boer et al . 30 program on a Nucleofector ( Lonza ) using a mouse T cell nucleofection kit ( Lonza , VPA - 1006 ) , and rested overnight in R10 medium . EGFP + T cells were sorted and incubated in R10 medium for at least 2 h at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . Cells were injected under agarose containing CCL21 and inhibitors or vehicle control and allowed to acclimatize for at least 30 min in a humidified chamber on the microscope at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . Cells were imaged using a Leica SP8 FALCON confocal inverted microscope , equipped with a 63x plan apo ( 1 . 4 NA ) oil - immersion objective every 15 s for 2 . 5 or 5 min . Cells were excited using a white light source at 488 nm for EGFP . To determine protein localization , cells were aligned in the direction of migration and a 14 . 4x7 . 5 µm box was drawn around the outline of the cell . Images of these cell shapes were projected on top of each other using the mean intensity projection option . Imaging of WNK1 pathway proteins in fixed T cells 15 - well angiogenesis or 18 - well µ - slides ( ibidi , 81506 or 81816 ) were coated with 3 µg / ml mouse ICAM - 1 - human Fc fusion protein overnight at 4°C . Slides were washed 3x with PBS , blocked with 2 % BSA in PBS for 20 min at room temperature , and washed again three times . Naïve CD4 + T cells that had been incubated overnight at 37°C were resuspended in RPMI containing 0 . 5 % BSA , added to the µ - slides , and allowed to adhere for 1 h at 37°C . Cells were stimulated with 250 ng / ml CCL21 for 20 min , and then fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature . Cells were washed with PBS , blocked in 1 % BSA in PBS ( blocking buffer ) for 20 min , permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Tween20 in PBS for 15 min , washed with PBS and stained in blocking buffer overnight at 4°C with anti - CDC42 ( B - 8 mouse monoclonal , Santa Cruz ) , biotin - conjugated anti - CD44 ( IM7 rat monoclonal , BioLegend ) and one of these primary antibodies : anti - p - WNK1 ( S382 ) , anti - OXSR1 , anti - p - OXSR1 ( S325 ) , anti - SLC12A2 , anti - p - SLC12A2 ( T203 / T207 / T212 ) ( all sheep polyclonal sera from MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit ) or anti - AQP3 ( NBP1 - de Boer et al . 31 97927 rabbit polyclonal , Novus Biologicals ) . Cells were washed with PBS and incubated in blocking buffer for 1 h with Streptavidin - AlexaFluor 488 ( S11223 , Molecular Probes ) , goat anti - Mouse IgG - AlexaFluor 555 ( A - 21424 ) , and either goat anti - rabbit IgG - AlexaFluor 647 ( A - 21245 ) or donkey anti - sheep IgG - AlexaFluor 647 ( A - 21448 , all from ThermoFisher ) . Cells were washed twice with 0 . 1 % Tween20 in PBS and once with PBS containing DAPI to visualize the nucleus . Cells were washed once and covered with VectaMount AQ aqueous mounting medium ( Vector Laboratories ) and stored at 4°C until imaging . Cells were imaged on a Leica SP8 FALCON inverted confocal microscope with a 63x plan apo ( 1 . 4 NA ) oil - immersion objective . Fluorophores were excited with a white light laser . Cells were imaged in z - stacks consisting of 7 - 9 z - slices with a 1 µm spacing . To determine localization of WNK1 pathway proteins , CDC42 and CD44 were used to determine the leading and trailing edges ( LE and TE ) respectively . A line the full width of the cell was drawn along the length of the cell from the LE to the TE . Average fluorescence intensities were determined for each of 12 bins along the cell length . Intensity profiles were normalized from 0 - 1 , where 0 was the lowest signal and 1 the highest signal per protein , per cell . Binned normalized fluorescence intensities were used to calculate the correlations between LE and TE markers and WNK1 pathway proteins . To evaluate polarization of WNK1 pathway proteins , fluorescence was measured along the perimeter of the cell and the polarization ratio was calculated by dividing the fluorescence in the 25 % of the perimeter centered on the maximum fluorescence by the total fluorescence along the perimeter of the cell . Flow cytometric analysis of F - actin de Boer et al . 32 Overnight - rested mouse naïve CD4 + T cells were placed in RPMI , 0 . 5 % BSA and stimulated with CCL21 for the required time . Cells were immediately fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min . Cells were washed with PBS , permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Tween20 in PBS for 15 min , and blocked for 1 h in 2 % BSA in PBS . Cells were stained with phalloidin conjugated to iFluor - 488 ( Abcam ) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature , washed twice with 0 . 1 % Tween20 , and once with PBS . Cells were analyzed on an LSRII flow cytometer ( BD Biosciences ) and mean fluorescence intensity was quantified using FlowJo ( BD Biosciences ) . Analysis of plasma membrane to F - actin spacing Overnight - rested mouse naïve CD4 + T cells constitutively expressing LifeAct - eGFP were labeled with CellMask Orange ( ThermoFisher ) to stain the plasma membrane following the manufacturer’s instructions . Cells were washed once with PBS , resuspended in R10 medium and injected under CCL21 - and inhibitor - containing agarose in a glass bottom 8 - well µ - slide dishes ( ibidi ) pre - coated with ICAM - 1 . Cells were imaged by iSIM using an iSIM microscope ( VisiTech ) with an Olympus 150x TIRF apo ( 1 . 45 NA ) oil - immersion objective . Cells were simultaneously excited at 488 nm for LifeAct - eGFP and 561 nm for CellMask Orange . Emission fluorescence was split with a dichroic mirror with a long - pass filter at 561 nm and was simultaneously detected using 2 sCMOS cameras ( Prime BSI Express , Teledyne Photometrics ) . Cells were imaged every 250 ms for a total of 30 s in a single z - plane proximal to the coverslip . To correct for chromatic aberration and camera alignment , 0 . 5 µm TetraSpeck fluorescent beads ( ThermoFisher ) were imaged after each session using the same acquisition settings as the cells . Images were deconvoluted using Huygens software ( Scientific Volume Imaging ) with the ‘Normal’ deconvolution template . A random frame from the time - lapse series was chosen de Boer et al . 33 while viewing only the plasma membrane stain to avoid bias . The leading edge of the cell was determined from the direction of migration . Adapting a previously described analysis protocol 56 , a 30 - pixel wide line was drawn along the leading edge , with the plasma membrane placed in the middle of the line . The line and the data within it were straightened out and 20 - pixel wide overlapping lines were drawn perpendicular to the plasma membrane signal , along the length of the leading edge . Fluorescence intensity data were normalized from 0 - 1 , and the intensity profiles in each 20 - pixel wide line were manually aligned according to the peak of plasma membrane fluorescence intensity . The distance between the peak plasma membrane signal and the peak F - actin signal was calculated within each line , with the peak of F - actin defined as the highest LifeAct - eGFP fluorescence intensity within 400 nm of the plasma membrane . Analysis of membrane proximal F - actin Mouse naïve CD4 + T cells were transfected with C1 - MPAct - mCherry ( Addgene # 155222 , gift from Tobias Meyer ) and C1 - eGFP - CaaX ( Addgene # 86056 , gift from Lei Lu ) plasmids using the X - 001 program on a Nucleofector ( Lonza ) and rested overnight in T cell medium ( Lonza ) . GFP + mCherry + T cells were sorted and incubated in R10 medium for at least 2 h at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . Cells were injected under agarose containing CCL21 and inhibitors or vehicle control and allowed to acclimatize for at least 30 min in a humidified chamber on the microscope at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . Cells were imaged using a Leica SP8 FALCON confocal inverted microscope , equipped with a 63x plan apo ( 1 . 4 NA ) oil - immersion objective every 15 s for 2 . 5 or 5 min . Cells were excited using a white light source at 488 nm for eGFP - CaaX and at 585 nm for MPAct - mCherry , and acquired simultaneously . To analyze the distribution of the MPAct probe , one random frame per migrating cell was selected using FIJI . Bias was avoided by selecting frames using only the GFP - CaaX de Boer et al . 34 signal . The leading edge of the cell was determined from the direction of migration . A line the full length and width of the cell was draw from the front to the back of the cell . Average fluorescence intensities were determined for each of 12 bins along the cell length . Fluorescence intensity levels were normalized with the highest intensity value per fluorophore , per cell set to 1 . The normalized MPAct - mCherry signal was divided by the normalized eGFP - CaaX signal to generate the MPAct / CaaX ratio . Polarization of the MPAct signal was determined by dividing the MPAct / CaaX ratio in the front 3 bins by the ratio in the rear 3 bins . TIRF microscopy of F - actin retrograde flow 35 mm round glass - bottom dishes ( Greiner Bio - One ) were cleaned with 1 M HCl for 15 min and washed three times with water . Dishes were plasma - activated for 30 s ( HPT - 100 , Henniker Plasma ) and coated with 0 . 2 mg / ml poly ( L - lysine ) - graft - PEG ( SuSoS ) in PBS overnight at 4°C , blocked with 2 % BSA in PBS for 20 min , and washed three times with PBS . Overnight - rested mouse naïve CD4 + T cells constitutively expressing LifeAct - eGFP were injected under agarose containing CCL21 and either inhibitors or vehicle control . Cells were imaged at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 using an Olympus IX83 total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscope with a 150x 1 . 45 NA TIRF apo oil - immersion objective every 1 s for 1 min . Actin flow rates were determined from kymographs generated using FIJI . RNA sequencing data Data on expression of Aqp and Slc12a mRNAs in mouse CD4 + T cells was taken from an RNA sequencing analysis of naive mouse CD4 + T cells ( Sequence Read Archive , SRA accession number SRP059425 ) 6 . de Boer et al . 35 Statistical analysis To determine statistical significance between two unpaired groups , we used a Mann - Whitney U test . To determine statistical significance when there were more than two groups and one variable , we used either a Kruskal - Wallis test when the data was not normally distributed , and unpaired and unmatched , or a 1 - way ANOVA when the data was normally distributed and unmatched . When comparing multiple paired groups , we used a Friedman test . When comparing two or more groups , but with two variables ( i . e . time and inhibitor / genotype ) a 2 - way ANOVA or a mixed effects analysis was used . To correct p - values for multiple comparisons we used the False Discovery Rate ( FDR ) method with the two - stage step - up to generate q - values 57 , 58 . q < 0 . 05 was used as a cut - off to determine statistical significance . In cases where there was no multiple comparison correction ( Mann - Whitney tests ) , p < 0 . 05 was used as a cut - off to determine statistical significance . All statistical analysis was performed using Prism ( GraphPad ) .

Dots represent F - actin flow rates within single cells , lines represent median . ( F ) Proposed model : CCL21 binding to CCR7 at the leading edge of the migrating CD4 + T cell results in activation of WNK1 , which phosphorylates and activates OXSR1 and STK39 . These in turn phosphorylate SLC12A - family proteins , resulting in entry of Na + , K + and Cl - ions into the cell and consequent water entry through AQP3 ( and other aquaporins ) by osmosis . Water entry swells the plasma membrane , creating space into which actin filaments can extend , thereby protruding the cell forward .
