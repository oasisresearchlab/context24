The activation of monocyte – macrophages plays major roles in vascular biology . Herein , we aimed to analyze monocyte – macro - phage polarization status in subjects with IFG and / or IGT compared with normal glucose tolerant ( NGT ) individuals . We enrolled 87 middle - aged individuals with low preva - lence of cardiovascular disease . Based on OGTT , they were divided into 49 NGT and 38 pre - diabetic ( IFG and / or IGT ) . Using ﬂow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood cells , we quantiﬁed traditional monocyte subsets based on CD14 and CD16 expression as well as novel monocyte – macrophage pro - inﬂammatory CD68 ? CCR2 ? M1 and anti - inﬂammatory CX3CR1 ? CD163 ? / CD206 ? M2 phe - notypes . The M1 / M2 ratio was taken to represent the polarization balance . There were no differences in tradi - tional classical ( CD14 ? ? CD16 - ) , intermediate ( CD14 ? ? CD16 ? ) and nonclassical ( CD14 ? CD16 ? ) monocytes between groups . Rather , compared to NGT , pre - diabetic subjects showed a signiﬁcant increase in pro - inﬂammatory M1 cells and percent expression of the oxLDL scavenger receptor CD68 , without changes in anti - inﬂammatory M2 cells . M1 levels and CD68 expression were directly correlated with HbA 1c . We show for the ﬁrst time that otherwise healthy pre - diabetic subjects have excess M1 inﬂammatory cells in peripheral blood , which may contribute to cardiovascular risk . Keywords Innate immunity (cid:2) Atherosclerosis (cid:2) Diabetes Introduction Conditions of pre - diabetes , deﬁned as impaired fasting glucose ( IFG ) and / or impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT ) , are characterized by increased cardiovascular risk , which is believed to derive at least in part from a chronic inﬂam - matory status [ 1 – 3 ] . A pivotal aspect of inﬂammation is the polarization of monocyte – macrophages , which play major roles in vessel wall remodeling [ 4 ] . Resident vascular macrophages sense local stimuli that induce polarization into a pro - inﬂammatory ( M1 ) phenotype prone to foam cell differentiation , or into an anti - inﬂammatory ( M2 ) status with scavenger activity [ 4 ] . Importantly , M1 and M2 cells have major opposing activity in the atherosclerotic process [ 4 ] . Indeed , hyperglycemia - driven induction of inﬂamma - tory myeloid cells sustains atherosclerosis in diabetic mice [ 5 ] . To some extent , macrophage diversity is reﬂected by traditional monocyte subsets , divided into classical ( inﬂammatory ) , intermediate and nonclassical ( anti - inﬂammatory ) phenotypes [ 6 ] , the distribution of which has been shown to be predictive of cardiovascular events [ 7 ] . We have recently devised and validated a new ﬂow cytometry protocol to analyze deﬁnite M1 and M2 phe - notypes of circulating monocytes , which show distinctive Communicated by Massimo Federici . G .

However , to the best of our knowledge , the polarization status of monocyte – macrophages in pre - diabetic subjects is currently unknown . Herein , we sought to analyze tradi - tional and novel monocyte – macrophage polarization phe - notypes in subjects with IFG and / or IGT compared with normal glucose tolerant ( NGT ) individuals . Methods Patients The study was approved by the local ethical committee and was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 2000 . Individuals were recruited among con - secutive subjects referred to the outpatient clinic of the Division of Metabolic Diseases of the University Hospital of Padova for screening and treatment for metabolic dis - orders . All provided informed consent . Subjects underwent a standard 75 g oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) to deﬁne their carbohydrate metabolism status . They were classiﬁed as NGT [ fasting plasma glucose B 100 mg / dl ( 5 . 5 mmol / l ) and 2 - h plasma glucose \ 140 mg / dl ( 7 . 8 mmol / l ) ] , IFG [ 100 mg / dl ( 5 . 5 mmol / l ) B fasting plasma glucose B 125 mg / dl ( 6 . 9 mmol / l ) ] or IGT [ 2 - h plasma glucose C 140 mg / dl ( 7 . 7 mmol / l ) ] . Exclusion cri - teria were as follows : diagnosis of diabetes , acute disease or infection , chronic inﬂammatory disease , pregnancy or lactation . For all subjects , we recorded the following data : age , sex , weight , height ( BMI was calculated as kg / m 2 ) , waist circumference , prevalence of hypertension and smoking habit , serum lipid proﬁle ( LDL was calculated using Friedewald formula ) . HbA 1c was measured using HPLC as recommended by IFCC . Cardiovascular disease was deﬁned as a history of myocardial infarction , angina , stroke , transient ischemic attack , carotid or lower limb atherosclerosis . Finally , we collected information on medications . Flow cytometry Identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of monocyte subsets in whole peripheral blood samples was performed as previ - ously described [ 8 ] . For analysis of classical , intermediate and nonclassical monocytes , after red blood cell lysis , white blood cells were stained with a FITC - conjugated anti - CD14 mAb ( Becton – Dickinson , clone M5E2 ) and a PE - conjugated anti - CD16 mAb ( Beckman – Coulter , clone 3G8 ) . The ana - lysis was performed according to standardized gating strat - egy in the monocytic morphological SSC vs FCS gate . Classical CD14 ? ? CD16 - cells were deﬁned based on high ( about 10 4 ) CD14 intensity and low / neg CD16 expression . Intermediate CD14 ? ? CD16 ? cells were deﬁned based on high CD14 intensity and CD16 positivity ( about 10 4 ) . Nonclassical CD14 ? CD16 ? cells were deﬁned as low CD14 intensity ( about 10 2 – 10 3 ) and CD16 positivity ( Fig . 1a , b ) . For more deﬁnite monocyte subsets , we stained with FITC - conjugated anti - CD68 mAb ( Dako , clone KP1 ) and PE - conjugated anti - CCR2 mAb ( R & D Systems , clone 4860 ) for identiﬁcation of M1 cells and with FITC - conjugated anti - CX3CR1 ( Biolegend , clone 2A9 - 1 ) , PE - conjugated anti - CD163 ( BD , clone GHI / 61 ) and APC - conjugated anti - CD206 ( BD , clone 19 . 2 ) mAbs for M2 . First , we gated monocytes in the morphological SSC vs FSC plot and then analyzed the expression of CD68 and CCR2 for M1 identi - ﬁcation ( CD68 ? CCR2 ? cells ) or , in separate tubes , the expression of CX3CR1 , CD163 and CD206 for M2 identi - ﬁcation ( Fig . 1d , e ) . As we previously reported that expression of CD163 and CD206 on circulating monocytic cells convey similar quantitative and qualitative information [ 8 ] , M2 was deﬁned as cells that coexpress the patrolling chemokine receptor CX3CR1 and the scavenger receptors CD163 or CD206 ( CX3CR1 ? CD163 ? / CD206 ? cells , Fig . 1g , h ) . A total of 500 , 000 events were acquired on a FACS Canto instrument ( BD ) and scored with the Flojo software ( BD ) . The relative frequency of these monocyte subsets was expressed as percent of the monocyte gate . Statistical analysis Data are expressed as mean ± SEM or as percentage when appropriate . Normality of continuous variables was checked with the Kolmogorov – Smirnov test . For compar - ison between IFG / IGT and NGT subjects , Student’s t test and Mann – Whitney’s U tests were used for normal and skewed variables , respectively . Correlation was checked Fig . 1 Study of monocyte – macrophage phenotypes in IFG / IGT versus NGT subjects .

The 2 groups were matched for age and sex . In addition to HbA 1c and glucose values , there were expected differences between the 2 groups , as IFG / IGT subjects had higher waist circumference and prevalence of hypertension ( Table 1 ) . The prevalence of cardiovascular disease was low and nonsigniﬁcantly higher in IFG / IGT subjects , indicating that this population was composed by relatively healthy middle - aged individuals . First , based on CD14 and CD16 staining , we quantiﬁed traditional peripheral blood monocyte subsets . The per - centages of CD14 ? ? CD16 - classical , CD14 ? ? CD16 ? intermediate and CD14 ? CD16 ? nonclassical monocytes were identical in IFG / IGT compared with NGT subjects ( Fig . 1a – c ) . Then , we analyzed novel monocyte phenotypes that have been recently validated against the macrophage polarization process [ 8 ] . Compared to NGT controls , IFG / IGT individuals had signiﬁcantly increased CD68 ? CCR2 ? monocytes , referred to as pro - inﬂammatory M1 ( 48 . 5 ± 2 . 7 vs . 38 . 0 ± 3 . 1 % ; p = 0 . 014 ; Fig . 1d – f ) . This was mainly attributable to increased expression of CD68 ( 56 . 0 ± 2 . 9 vs . 44 . 2 ± 3 . 4 % ; p = 0 . 012 ) while CCR2 expression was similar ( 77 . 4 ± 2 . 1 vs . 78 . 6 ± 1 . 7 % ; p = 0 . 64 ) . A multivariable analysis , performed to rule out that this association was confounded by the different prevalence of hypertension , conﬁrmed that IFG / IGT sub - jects had an excess in M1 of ( beta ± SEM ) 9 . 5 ± 4 . 3 % after adjustment for hypertension ( p = 0 . 035 ) . There was no signiﬁcant difference in anti - inﬂammatory M2 cells , deﬁned as CX3CR1 ? CD163 ? / CD206 ? mono - cytes between IFG / IGT and NGT ( Fig . 1g – i ) . M1 and M2 levels were similar among subjects with isolated IFG , isolated IGT or both IFG and IGT ( Fig . 1j ) . Out of all the clinical variables considered in Table 1 , we only found a direct correlation between M1 levels or CD68 expression and HbA 1c ( for M1 r = 0 . 30 ; p = 0 . 005 ; Fig . 1k . For CD68 r = 0 . 28 ; p = 0 . 006 ; Fig . 1l ) . When HbA 1c was entered in the multivariable analysis , the association between M1 levels and IFG / IGT was lost , suggesting it was mainly driven by mild chronic hyperglycemia . The M1 / M2 ratio has been previously considered as an indicator of the monocyte – macrophage polarization bal - ance . We found that , despite the M1 increase , IFG / IGT subjects showed a normal M1 / M2 ratio ( Fig . 1m ) .

When we compared the clinical characteristics of subjects with M1 / M2 ratio below or above 10 , we found that those with a high M1 / M2 ratio had signiﬁcantly higher HDL cholesterol levels ( 63 . 1 ± 5 . 6 vs . 53 . 0 ± 1 . 9 mg / dl ; p = 0 . 035 ) , while there were no differences in the other clinical characteristics . Discussion We show for the ﬁrst time that pre - diabetes is characterized by increased pro - inﬂammatory M1 monocyte – macro - phages in peripheral blood . This adds new insight into the spectrum of inﬂammatory features associated with pre - diabetes [ 1 , 2 , 9 ] . M1 cells are prone to differentiation into foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions by virtue of their distinctive cholesterol responsive transcriptional proﬁle and expression of the oxLDL scavenger receptor CD68 [ 10 ] . Unlike CD163 and CD206 expression , which confers protective tissue - cleaning capacity to M2 macrophages , CD68 expression , driving cholesterol loading , was signif - icantly increased in pre - diabetic subjects . Therefore , excess M1 may be a previously neglected explanation for the increased cardiovascular risk associated with pre - diabetes . The mechanisms inducing M1 and CD68 expression are at present unknown , but chronic hyperglycemia via a RAGE—NF - kB inﬂammatory pathway has been shown to mediate excess myelopoiesis and inﬂammation [ 5 ] . Indeed , hyperglycemia and elevated HbA 1c induce inﬂammatory gene expression in monocytes from type 2 diabetic patients [ 11 ] , and CD68 expression is induced twofold in mesangial cells exposed to high glucose in GEO series GSE2557 [ 12 ] . Herein , this concept is supported by the direct correlations of M1 cell levels and CD68 expression with HbA 1c . We were unable to detect any difference in traditional monocyte subsets between pre - diabetic and control sub - jects . However , the distribution of monocyte subsets appears to be generally skewed toward the intermediate phenotype in our population compared with literature data [ 6 , 7 ] , probably owing to the frequent use of statins ( Table 1 ) , which are anti - inﬂammatory [ 13 ] and can affect myeloid cell polarization [ 14 ] . The pattern of M1 / M2 alterations in pre - diabetes is apparently in contrast to the recently reported M2 reduction in type 2 diabetes [ 8 ] . While pre - diabetes and type 2 dia - betes can be seen as a metabolic continuum , chronicity and complications of type 2 diabetes appear to regulate M1 and M2 cells in a way that is different to what seen in pre - diabetes . In particular , bone marrow alterations of diabetic patients are believed to induce M2 deﬁciency [ 8 ] . While diabetic patients show a markedly imbalanced M1 / M2 ratio , this is still normal in pre - diabetic subjects . None - theless , a minority of patients have very high M1 / M2 polarization ratio irrespectively of their metabolic pheno - type . A pilot investigation into the clinical characteristics of these subjects revealed that they have high HDL cho - lesterol levels . HDL dysfunction has been previously associated with pre - diabetes and cardiovascular risk [ 15 ] , and pre - clinical studies indicate that reverse cholesterol transport mechanisms are involved in the generation of inﬂammatory monocytes [ 16 ] . However , this difference may have occurred by chance because we did not detect any linear correlation between HDL cholesterol and M1 / M2 ratio ( Spearman’s q = 0 . 08 ; p = 0 . 53 ) . Future inves - tigations are needed to dissect the relationships between cholesterol metabolism and M1 / M2 cells in humans . In conclusion , this is the ﬁrst study analyzing in detail the monocyte – macrophage polarization status in pre - dia - betes . We demonstrate that otherwise healthy pre - diabetic subjects , unlike type 2 diabetic patients , have excess M1 inﬂammatory cells in peripheral blood , which can con - tribute to cardiovascular risk .
