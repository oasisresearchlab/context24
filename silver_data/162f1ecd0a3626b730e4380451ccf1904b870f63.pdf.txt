Stoichiometry and turnover in single , functioning membrane protein complexes Mark C . Leake 1 * , Jennifer H . Chandler 2 * , George H . Wadhams 2 , Fan Bai 1 , Richard M . Berry 1 & Judith P . Armitage 2 Many essential cellular processes are carried out by complex biological machines located in the cell membrane . The bacterial ﬂagellar motor is a large membrane - spanning protein complex that functions as an ion - driven rotary motor to propel cells through liquid media 1 – 3 . Within the motor , MotB is a component of the stator that couples ion ﬂow to torque generation and anchors the stator to the cell wall 4 , 5 . Here we have investigated the protein stoichiometry , dynamics and turnover of MotB with single - molecule precision in functioning bacterial ﬂagellar motors in Escherichia coli . We monitored motor function by rotation of a tethered cell body 6 , and simultaneously measured the number and dynamics of MotB molecules labelled with green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP – MotB ) in the motor by total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence microscopy . Counting ﬂuorophores by the stepwise photobleaching of single GFP molecules showed that each motor contains , 22 copies of GFP – MotB , consistent with , 11 stators each containing two MotB molecules . We also observed a mem - brane pool of , 200 GFP – MotB molecules diffusing at , 0 . 008 m m 2 s 2 1 . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and ﬂuorescence loss in photobleaching showed turnover of GFP – MotB between the membrane pool and motor with a rate constant of the order of 0 . 04 s 2 1 : the dwell time of a given stator in the motor is only , 0 . 5 min . This is the ﬁrst direct measurement of the number and rapid turnover of protein subunits within a function - ing molecular machine . Over 30 % of all proteins are integrated in biological membranes , where they carry out diverse essential cellular functions . Many membrane proteins function in multimeric complexes , and investi - gating their organization and dynamics is essential for understanding their function . GFP fusion constructs 7 have been used with total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy to detect single interactions at the basal membrane in vivo 8 , and ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) and ﬂuorescence loss in photobleaching ( FLIP ) have been used to measure dynamics of membrane protein populations 9 – 12 . Little is understood , however , about protein dynamics and turnover within individual complexes under natural conditions in living cells . Here we show that protein components of a functioning biological machine undergo rapid exchange with a freely diffusing pool in the cell membrane . The bacterial ﬂagellar motor is ideal for examining a single protein complex in vivo ; rotation of the whole cell when the ﬁlament is attached to a surface ( Fig . 1 ) is an instantaneous indicator of motor function . Previous research indicates that a motor has 8 – 16 sta - tors 4 , 5 , 13 – 15 , each containing two copies of MotB and four copies of MotA 16 . We replaced genomic motB in E . coli with gfp – motB to express GFP – MotB in wild - type amounts ( see Methods ) . Polystyrene beads ( 0 . 75 m m in diameter ) attached to ﬁlaments 17 rotated three times slower than on the parental strain ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) , indicating some reduction in GFP – MotB function . We attached live cells to a coverslip either by the ﬁlament ( ‘tethered’ ) or by the cell body ( ‘stuck’ ) and observed them with TIRF or brightﬁeld microscopy ( Fig . 1a ) . TIRF images of tethered cells showed spots at the centre of cell rotation measured from brightﬁeld images ( Fig . 1c , Supplementary Videos 1 and 2 ) . Similar spots were observed for stuck cells , with one or occasionally two spots visible .

Vol 443 | 21 September 2006 | doi : 10 . 1038 / nature05135 355 © 2006 Nature Publishing Group number were consistent with a ring of GFP – MotB molecules border - ing a rotor with a diameter of , 50 nm ( refs 14 , 18 ; Fig . 1b ) and , 6 motors per cell 19 ( Supplementary Note 1 ) . We modelled ﬂuorescence intensity ( I ) in 400 - nm square regions of interest ( ROIs ) containing a single motor as a uniform back - ground plus a gaussian spot of width 300 nm ( motor width plus microscope point - spread function ) and identiﬁed three background components : GFP – MotB in the membrane , nonspeciﬁc cellular autoﬂuorescence and instrumental background ( Supplementary Methods 2 ) . Cytoplasmic GFP and autoﬂuorescence were not expected to contribute because only the cell surface adjacent to the coverslip was illuminated . We estimated instrumental background from an empty ROI close to the cell in each image and autoﬂuores - cence from the parental strain . All cellular components showed roughly exponential photobleaching under TIRF illumination : I ( t ) ¼ I 0 exp ( 2 t / t 0 ) ( Fig . 2a , Table 1 and Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . The GFP membrane component bleached considerably more slowly than the motor , which we attribute to diffusive exchange with unbleached ﬂuorophores from outside the TIRF ﬁeld . Total intensity ( minus instrumental background ) in ROIs contain - ing motors photobleached in steps at roughly integer multiples of a unitary level , I GFP , consistent with photobleaching of individual GFP molecules 20 , 21 ( Fig . 2b , e ) . Separation into motor and background components introduced extra noise ( Fig . 2a ) ; therefore , we calculated I GFP using total intensity rather than the motor component alone . Figure 2c and d shows the pairwise - distance distribution function ( PDDF ; Supplementary Methods 3 ) and its power spectrum , respect - ively , for the ﬁltered curve 3 in Fig . 2b ( refs 22 , 23 ) . The peak in the power spectrum indicates a unitary step size of I GFP < 5 , 400 counts ( ref . 23 ) . To conﬁrm that this corresponds to bleaching of one GFP molecule , we reduced the background ﬂuorescence by prebleaching the cell , facilitating direct observation of successive photobleaching steps in the motor component of ﬂuorescence ( Fig . 2e and Sup - plementary Methods 4 ) . The double - sized step in Fig . 2e presumably corresponds to two successive unitary photobleaches that were not resolved by the ﬁltering algorithm ; furthermore , no steps were detected in photobleaches of the parental strain . Step - wise photo - bleaching of single surface - immobilized GFP molecules 24 showed an average step size of , 13 , 000 counts s 2 1 in our microscope , after correcting for differences in laser power and exposure time ( Fig . 2f ) . TIRF intensity falls exponentially with distance over , 100 nm ( Supplementary Methods 5 ) ; thus , the average value of I GFP is consistent with motors being , 90 nm from the coverslip . Supplementary Fig . 5a and b show distributions of I GFP and initial motor intensities ( I 0 m ) , respectively , for 134 traces from different cells . The widths probably reﬂect different TIRF intensities , which varied about fourfold over the measured range of cell heights ( , 150 nm ) owing to different distances from motor to coverslip . We estimated the total number of GFP – MotB molecules per motor by dividing I 0 m by I GFP for each trace ( Supplementary Fig . 5c ) . The reduced uncertainty of this estimate ( 22 ^ 6 , ^ s . d . ) as compared with the ratio of peaks in Supplementary Fig . 5a and b ( 19 ^ 8 ) reﬂects covariation of I 0 m and I GFP , as expected for variations due to TIRF intensity .

LETTERS NATURE | Vol 443 | 21 September 2006 356 © 2006 Nature Publishing Group background intensity by I GFP gave an average of 0 . 052 ^ 0 . 022 molecules per pixel . We estimated the cell - surface area as 3 , 700 ^ 500 pixels ; thus , the total number of non - motor GFP – MotB molecules per cell is 190 ^ 80 . We investigated protein turnover between membrane and motor components using focused laser exposures of 0 . 5 s to photobleach all ﬂuorophores in regions with a width of , 1 m m . Figure 3a shows TIRF images of a cell before and after bleaching of a region contain - ing a motor . Fluorescence recovery ( FRAP ) of both motor and background components in the bleached region is visible , as is ﬂuorescence loss ( ‘one - shot’ FLIP ; Supplementary Methods 5 ) at the other end of the cell . FRAP and FLIP ( Fig . 3b ) of motor and membrane components respectively , averaged over 13 – 38 cells , are shown in Fig . 3c and d . Both components recovered over the course of a few minutes ; motor recovery was slightly delayed as compared with membrane . Fluorescence loss occurred on the same timescale in both components . Fitting all of the membrane FRAP data from ROIs lacking motors to a model of a diffusing GFP – MotB membrane pool gave a diffusion coefﬁcient , D , of 0 . 0075 ^ 0 . 0013 m m 2 s 2 1 ( Supplementary Methods 6 ) . We obtained an independent , single - molecule estimate , D ¼ 0 . 0088 ^ 0 . 0026 m m 2 s 2 1 , by tracking mobile ﬂuorescent spots that could occasionally be resolved after prebleaching ( Supplemen - tary Methods 6 and Supplementary Videos 3 and 4 ) . The intensity of these spots was consistent with a GFP – MotB dimer ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . Fitting all of the FRAPand FLIP data to an extended diffusion model , incorporating binding and unbinding at the motor and bleaching in the TIRF ﬁeld ( Supplementary Methods 7 ) , gave a dissociation rate at the motor of 0 . 04 ^ 0 . 02 s 2 1 . The large uncer - tainty is a consequence of the small difference between recovery rates of motor and membrane components relative to noise . We also studied slow recovery after complete bleaching of whole cells ( Sup - plementary Methods 8 and Supplementary Videos 5 – 7 ) . After 90 min , ﬂuorescence recovery ranged from 75 % in buffer enriched with nutrients to 7 % with protein synthesis blocked ( attributable to GFP maturation 7 ) . Fluorophore counting indicated that there are 22 ^ 6 GFP – MotB molecules per motor . We conﬁrmed the accuracy of the counting by testing it against simulated TIRF photobleach traces generated by the extended diffusion model ( Supplementary Fig . 11 ) . We also measured very low ﬂuorescence anisotropy in motors after bleaching with polarized light ( Supplementary Methods 9 ) , indicating that GFP ﬂuorophores in motors are free to rotate and therefore all are counted by the photobleaching method . Measurements of solubility and copuriﬁcation with MotA suggest that MotB is stable in the cytoplasmic membrane only as a dimer in 1 : 2 stoichiometry with MotA 16 . This suggests that , on average , a motor has 11 stators , each with the composition MotA 4 : MotB 2 . Early work estimated 16 stators in a motor 4 , whereas subsequent studies estimated 8 stators 5 . We previously observed at least 11 discrete speed increments after induced expression of functional Mot proteins in a defective back - ground 15 . Our photobleaching result also agrees with freeze - fracture electron microscopy showing 11 – 12 stators around the rotor 14 . The broad distributions in our counting estimates may include both natural variation in the number of stators per motor and noise due to background ﬂuorescence , GFP blinking 20 and instrumental limi - tations . We measured a mobile membrane pool of , 200 GFP – MotB molecules with D < 0 . 008 m m 2 s 2 1 , which is , 40 % smaller than the diffusion rate measured for free membrane proteins of comparable size to a GFP – MotB dimer 25 , and only , 20 % smaller than that for a MotA 4 : ( GFP – MotB ) 2 stator , assuming that the Stokes radius r scales to the 1 / 3 power with molecular weight and that D scales as 1 / r . A relatively high value of D agrees with other data suggesting that MotB in the membrane pool does not bind signiﬁcantly to the cell wall 26 . Eleven stators , each with a dissociation rate , 0 . 04 s 2 1 , gives an overall exchange of , 0 . 44 stators per s . In summary , by replacing wild - type motB in the genome with gfp – motB , we expressed the fusion protein in natural quantities , enabling us to investigate protein stoichiometry and dynamics under physio - logical conditions . Our methods for counting the number of proteins in a membrane complex in living cells and observing their turnover using TIRF microscopy should be applicable to other membrane protein complexes . Unexpectedly , an anchored component , MotB 27 , of a multiprotein complex was found to diffuse in the membrane and exchange rapidly with the motor , a ﬁnding that may alter the conventional ‘static’ view of molecular complexes ; if proteins in the ﬂagellar motor are undergoing dynamic exchange , this ﬁnding may well apply to other macromolecular complexes . It should be possible using similar methods to learn whether other membrane proteins also turnover rapidly and , if not , to investigate possible reasons for differences between complexes .
