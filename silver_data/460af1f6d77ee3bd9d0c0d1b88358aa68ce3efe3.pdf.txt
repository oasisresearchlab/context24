This high water swelling ratio , their softness , and the possibility to regulate their biophysical and biochemical properties have made hydrogels the preferred biomaterials to mimic the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) that supports living cells in their native microenvironment . Therefore , hydrogels with regulated properties are extensively used as supporting materials in cell biology , tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications . Poly ( acrylamide ) ( PAM ) hydrogels are synthetic matrices widely used as substrates for 2D cell culture . These reductionistic in vitro models allow to investigate how cells sense and respond to variations in this synthetic microenvironment . For instance , the effects of hydrogel ’ s elasticity and / or biochemical cues on cell adhesion , spreading , migration , differentiation and protein expression have been reported . ( Pelham and Wang , 1997 ; Heras - Bautista FIGURE 1 Most used chemical strategies for PAM gels biofunctionalization . ( A ) General scheme depicting the synthesis of PAM gels via FRP .

( D ) Overall qualitative comparison of the different chemical strategies in view of their experimental dif ﬁ culty and cost vs . control of bioconjugation process and chemo - selectivity . Frontiers in Chemistry frontiersin . org 02 Wolfel et al . 10 . 3389 / fchem . 2022 . 1012443 et al . , 2019 ) PAM hydrogels present important advantages that explain their extended use in cell biology laboratories in the last 25 years . PAM is simple to synthesize and cost - effective , its mechanical properties ( e . g . , elasticity ) can be easily regulated within the physiological range of native soft tissues , and its optical transparency makes it compatible with microscopy methods . PAM hydrogels are typically synthesized by the acrylic - based free radical polymerization ( FRP ) of acrylamide ( AM ) and the crosslinker bis - acrylamide ( bis - AM ) , using persulfate and TEMED as redox initiators ( Figure 1A ) . For comfortable handling during cell culture and imaging , PAM is frequently prepared as thin ﬁ lm ( thickness < 100 µm ) and covalently attached to conventional microscopy glass coverslips , ( Pelham and Wang , 1997 ) , although attachment of thicker ﬁ lm gels to plastic multiwell culture plates is gaining momentum towards high - throughput studies . ( Díaz - Bello et al . , 2019 ) . For robust experimentation and reproducible outcome during culture of adherent cells on PAM gels , precise tailoring of mechanical and biochemical features of PAM substrates is desirable . Mechanically tunable PAM gels ( for example , with regulable elasticity characterized by the Young ’ s modulus E in the range of 0 . 1 – 100 kPa ) can be obtained by adjusting the bis - AM crosslinker concentration and / or the total content of acrylamide monomers in the precursor solution , ( Denisin and Pruitt , 2016 ) , and numerous standard protocols can be found in the literature . ( Tse and Engler , 2010 ; Paez et al . , 2018 ) In contrast , precise modulation of the biochemical properties ( e . g . , cell - adhesiveness to promote cell - material interactions ) remains challenging because biofunctionalization of these materials is not straightforward . The reason is that PAM hydrogels are intrinsically protein repellent and chemically inert , with the lateral amide groups being poorly reactive under mild aqueous conditions . Mild conditions are required to preserve the integrity and bioactivity of bound ligands post - functionalization . Thus , various chemical strategies to enable the controlled bioconjugation of ligands to PAM gels have been developed . These strategies can be summarized in two main groups : those that target the direct “ activation ” of the side chains of PAM after FRP , followed by ligand bioconjugation ( Figure 1B ) ; and those based on the incorporation of reactive monomers during FRP followed by bioconjugation Figure 1C ) . In this mini review , the most used chemical strategies developed for controlled biofunctionalization of PAM gels for cell culture are presented and compared . Commercial PAM hydrogels have become available ; thus they are also introduced . Advantages and limitations of the diverse approaches are discussed , especially in terms of chemo - selectivity and site - speci ﬁ city of binding , preservation of ligand ’ s functionality after conjugation , user - friendliness and cost ( wherever known ) . 1 The aim of this work is to guide users in the choice of a strategy to fabricate PAM gels with tailored biochemical properties for 2D cell culture . 2 Chemical strategies for poly ( acrylamide ) gels biofunctionalization 2 . 1 Direct activation of poly ( acrylamide ) side chains After gel fabrication , PAM chains are ( photo ) chemically activated , generally under harsh conditions , to introduce reactive groups that are later used as anchoring groups for biofunctionalization . In a second step , the bioligand is covalently coupled to activated PAM gels ( Figure 1B ) . 2 . 1 . 1 Short - wavelength UV irradiation PAM hydrogels are photochemically activated by short wavelength UV light irradiation ( λ = 180 nm , 2 – 4 min ) that forms ozone as well as peroxides and other reactive species on the PAM chains . ( Tseng et al . , 2011 ) The substrates are then incubated in EDC / NHS solution for chemical activation ( in 10 mM MES buffer , pH 5 . 5 , 15 min , r . t . ) , followed by incubation with biomolecules that present amine groups , such as ﬁ bronectin or ﬁ brinogen ( in 10 mM HEPES , pH 8 . 5 , 1 h , r . t . ) ( Figure 1 . B1 ) . ( Tseng et al . , 2012 ) A photomask can be used to create ligand micropatterns with good spatial resolution . This method is simple and has been reported to enable biofunctionalization of PAM hydrogels in a reproducible and homogeneous fashion . However , this procedure uses harsh photoirradiation conditions that might alter the mechanical strength of modi ﬁ ed vs . bare PAM gels . Finally , the lack of chemo - selectivity might lead to poor control of the ligand loading and functionality . 2 . 1 . 2 Long - wavelength UV irradiation and sulfo - SANPAH This is one of the most used strategies for PAM hydrogel bioconjugation with amine - bearing ligands . It is mediated by the commercial reagent sulfo - SANPAH , a photoactivatable heterobifunctional molecule . ( Pelham and Wang , 1997 ) The PAM gel is incubated in a solution of sulfo - SANPAH and exposed to longer - wavelength UV light ( λ = 330 – 365 nm , r . t . , at variable exposure times and intensity ) ( Figure 1 . B2 ) . Upon 1 The listed reagents ’ prices correspond to the cheapest alternative that is offered by an European provider , to the best of the author ’ s knowledge at the time of writing .

Typically , after two rounds of the activation step , the resulting hydrogel is immediately incubated in a solution of ligand ( r . t . , incubation times from 2 to 16 h ) . Note that the bioligand FIGURE 2 Examples of cells cultured on PAM hydrogels that were biofunctionalized through diverse chemical strategies .

Frontiers in Chemistry frontiersin . org 04 Wolfel et al . 10 . 3389 / fchem . 2022 . 1012443 immobilization must be performed immediately after the sulfo - SANPAH step to avoid the inactivation of sulfo - succinimidyl groups via hydrolysis . Using this strategy , different ECM proteins such as collagen I were bound to PAM gels to mediate cell adhesion , for example , to study the traction forces generated during cell migration ( Dembo and Wang , 1999 ) or to assess the relationship between energy expenditure during cell spreading and cellular mechanoresponse . ( Xie et al . , 2021 ) In comparison to the short - wavelength irradiation strategy shown above , sulfo - SANPAH strategy is milder and renders higher ef ﬁ ciency of bioconjugation , while it keeps the simplicity of NHS ester / amine coupling . However , sulfo - SANPAH is very pricy ( ~ 350 € per 50 mg ) and has short shelf life . There is a lack of consensus on the experimental conditions for the photo - illumination step , e . g . , in terms of light intensity and irradiation time . Consequently , highly variable irradiation doses can be found in the literature , which is re ﬂ ected in high variability in the ef ﬁ ciency of bioconjugation . Additionally , poor site - selectivity of the NHS ester / amine binding has been suggested to cause poor binding ef ﬁ ciency and impaired ligand ’ s bioactivity , leading to inconsistent results in cell response . ( Farrukh et al . , 2016 ) 2 . 1 . 3 Hydrazinolysis The amide groups of PAM chains are chemically converted to hydrazide groups by reaction with hydrazine ( 2 h , r . t . ) , followed by treatment of the gel with acetic acid ( 1 h , r . t . ) . The formed hydrazide groups are subsequently coupled to aldehyde or ketone groups located in biomolecules , forming hydrazone bonds . ( Timofeev et al . , 1996 ) Aldehyde or ketone bearing biomolecules can be prepared by reaction with an oxidizing agent such as sodium periodate , and then covalently bound to PAM - hydrazide gels ( 1 h , r . t . ) ( Lee et al . , 2016 ) ( Figure 1 . B3 ) . Following this procedure , various ECM proteins including collagen I , collagen IV , ﬁ bronectin and laminin were ef ﬁ ciently conjugated to PAM - hydrazide gels and enabled micropatterning for mechano - transduction assays ( see Figure 2A ) . ( Damljanovic et al . , 2005 ) Furthermore , ﬁ bronectin - coated gels were used to study the in ﬂ uence of interfacial geometry on cancer stem cell tumorigenicity . ( Lee et al . , 2016 ) This simple procedure has been reported to facilitate uniform , reproducible and ef ﬁ cient protein conjugation on PAM surface using inexpensive commercial chemicals . Additionally , the PAM - hydrazide hydrogels can be produced in big batches and are stable for 2 months . ( Timofeev et al . , 1996 ) However , some limitations can be mentioned . The oxidation of biomolecules prior to conjugation typically generates multiple aldehyde or ketone groups in the structure . Low control of site - selectivity might decrease ligand ’ s functionality and hamper precise control over loading . Moreover , hydrazone bonds are reversible and prone to hydrolysis under physiological conditions , therefore , biofunctionalized gels are only stable for about 2 days ( Timofeev et al . , 1996 ) . This is inconvenient for longer - term cell cultures . 2 . 1 . 4 Poly ( maleic anhydride ) copolymers PAM hydrogels are spin - coated with a thin layer of commercially available poly ( maleic anhydride ) copolymers , such as poly ( ethylene - alt - maleic anhydride ) ( PEMA ) , and incubated overnight ( in PBS , pH 7 . 4 ) . The anhydride groups of PEMA react chemically with amide groups of PAM hydrogel via covalent imide bond formation that leads to the attachment of a PEMA monolayer onto PAM . ( Müller et al . , 2018 ) Subsequently , PAM - PEMA gels are incubated in ligand solution , such as ﬁ bronectin ( in PBS , pH 7 . 4 . , r . t . , 1 h ) and rinsed ( Figure 1 . B4 ) . The PEMA layer promotes the binding of biomolecules via physical adsorption . ( Müller et al . , 2018 ) ( Pompe et al . , 2011 ) Through this approach , PAM gels biofunctionalized with ﬁ bronectin have been used to study the mechano - transduction mechanisms of HUVECs . ( Müller et al . , 2019 ) Similar gels were used to evaluate cellular traction force and ﬁ bronectin reorganization on adhered HUVECs . ( Pompe et al . , 2011 ) It was found that the cellular traction force correlated with the mobility of ﬁ bronectin during cell - driven ﬁ bronectin ﬁ brillogenesis ( Figure 2B ) . An advantage of this approach is that a stable PEMA layer on PAM surface can be achieved using the inexpensive PEMA ( ~ 70 € per 100 g ) in a relatively simple procedure . Spin - coating ensures a thin and uniform layer but could also be a limitation in scaling up production . The lack of speci ﬁ city and the instability of the ligand binding to the PEMA layer could be a disadvantage for those applications requiring ﬁ ne control of ligand loading . However , reversible physical interaction between the bioligands and the PEMA layer is advantageous for mechano - transduction studies that require mobility of the adhesive ligands on top of PAM substrates . ( Pompe et al . , 2011 ) 2 . 2 Copolymerization with functionalized acrylic comonomers Acrylic comonomers that present an additional functional group are copolymerized with AM and bis - AM to synthesize hydrogels with pendant functional groups . After polymerization , such groups are used to immobilize bioligands through covalent or non - covalent interactions ( Figure 1C ) . In principle , by designing the right comonomer , any bioconjugation chemistry could be adapted to the synthesis of functional PAM copolymer hydrogels . Ideally , the comonomer should present decent water solubility and chemical compatibility with FRP conditions ( i . e . , not inhibiting PAM polymerization ) , be available from commercial sources or easy to synthesize , as well as cost - effective . Additionally , the introduction of this comonomer should not impair desirable PAM hydrogel properties for cell Frontiers in Chemistry frontiersin . org 05 Wolfel et al . 10 . 3389 / fchem . 2022 . 1012443 culture ( i . e . , transparency , controlled mechanical and swelling properties ) . 2 . 2 . 1 Streptavidin acrylamide Streptavidin - acrylamide ( streptavidin - AM ) is commercially available ( ~ 370 € per 1 mg ) . After copolymerization , the PAM - streptavidin gels are functionalized with biotinylated ligands via non - covalent , strong supramolecular interactions between streptavidin and biotin ( Figure 1 . C5 ) . Conveniently , this reaction occurs in aqueous media and at r . t . By this means , ligands such as laminin , ﬁ bronectin , and laminin - mimetic peptide IKVAV have been attached and micropatterned onto gels surface to allow cell attachment . ( Hynd et al . , 2007 ) Neural cells showed successful adhesion and a long - term viability on laminin and ﬁ bronectin - functionalized substrates . The advantages of this approach are its simplicity , the use of well - established and user - friendly supramolecular chemistry to bind the ligands , and the compatibility with microcontact printing . Diverse biotinylated ligands can be attached , for which there is good availability of commercial options . In addition , the formed hydrogels are highly hydrophilic and nondegradable . However , the streptavidin - AM comonomer and the biotinylated ligands are expensive , and other PAM functionalization alternatives may be more suitable when micropatterning is not needed . In addition , the ( to our knowledge ) lack of material characterization on PAM - streptavidin hydrogels may restrain its utilization towards further cell studies . 2 . 2 . 2 Acrylic acid Acrylic acid ( AA ) is commercially available and cost - effective ( ~ 40 € per 1 L ) . After copolymerization , carboxylic acids of PAM - AA gels are activated with EDC / NHS to form NHS esters , followed by covalent coupling with amine - ligands ( Figure 1 . C6 ) . The bioconjugation step carries out under mild reaction conditions ( 1 h , r . t . , near - neutral pH ) in high yields and the formed amide bond is very stable . Since many biomolecules have free primary amine groups , this strategy offers wide versatility in the type of ligands to immobilize . For example , RGD peptide ( Farrukh et al . , 2017a ) , poly - D - lysine ( Farrukh et al . , 2017b ) , and laminin mimetic IKVAV peptides ( Farrukh et al . , 2018 ) have been successfully bioconjugated to PAM - AA hydrogels . Commercial availability , excellent water solubility and low cost are the most important advantages of this strategy , while potential limitations are the poor site - selectivity of coupling and alteration of various gel ’ s properties , as explained below . First , the site - selectivity of the NHS ester / amine cannot be controlled , thus any amine group that is suf ﬁ ciently exposed in the ligand might bind . Many biomolecules have multiple amine groups , and some can play a structural role in their bioactivity . Therefore , their immobilization through NHS ester / amine coupling can lead to impaired functionality when the amine group locates in the active sequence , such as Lys in IKVAV ( Farrukh et al . , 2018 ) . A possibility to ameliorate this limitation is to add more conjugation steps mediated by biotin / streptavidin supramolecular interactions . For example , after PAM - AA synthesis and functionalization with biotin - PEG - amine via NHS ester / amine coupling , the biotin groups can mediate supramolecular binding of streptavidin followed by attachment of site - controlled biotinylated ligands ( e . g . , produced recombinantly ) . Using this strategy , hydrogels micropatterned with biotinylated anti - CD3 antibodies by microcontact printing , at tunable ligand density and variable gel stiffness were used to study the interplay of receptors and forces in T cell activation . ( Zhang et al . , 2021 ) Although it involves more coupling steps and the use of biotinylated ligands that need to be specially synthesized , this strategy can increase the site - speci ﬁ city control of the bound molecule . Second , the carboxylic groups in PAM - AA gels are negatively charged under physiological conditions . This effect increases the water swelling ratio that in turn can signi ﬁ cantly modify several hydrogel ’ s properties such as stiffness , zeta - potential , and pore size ; consequently impacting cell behavior . For example , 18 mol % content of AA duplicates the swelling capacity of the gels in comparison to bare PAM , which increases the stress relaxation of the material and affects adhesion and differentiation of cultured hMSCs . ( Prouvé et al . , 2021 ) A possible way to control excessive swelling is the use of longer - chain carboxylic acid - functionalized comonomers . ( Heras - Bautista et al . , 2019 ; Norris et al . , 2021 ) 2 . 2 . 3 NHS - acrylate Acrylic acid N - hydroxysuccinimide ester ( NHS - AE ) ( ~ 40 € per 1 g ) is commercially available and used to prepared PAM - NHS gels for immobilization of amine - ligands . In relation to PAM - AA gels , PAM - NHS gels skip the AA activation step and can be directly used for NHS ester / amine bioconjugation ( Figure 1 . C7 ) . On the ﬂ ipside , NHS - AE presents low water solubility and also inhibits PAM polymerization at concentration > 16 mol % , which affects the mechanical strength of resulting gels . ( Kumai et al . , 2021 ) Due to solubility issues , NHS - AE is typically dissolved in toluene and incorporated to the AM and bis - AM aqueous mixture before polymerization . Different reported protocols have either localized NHS groups at the surface ( Schnaar et al . , 1978 ) or promoted homogeneous incorporation of the monomer along the PAM - NHS gel . ( Kumai et al . , 2021 ) Presumably , a differentiated localization of NHS monomers along the gel alters its properties , as well as functionalization ef ﬁ ciency and cell - behavior . MCF7 and MCF10A epithelial cells were seeded on PAM - NHS gels coated with collagen - I and compared with PAM gels functionalized via sulfo - SANPAH strategy . No noticeable differences in cell adhesion or morphology were observed between both gels . ( Kumai et al . , 2021 ) Despite the relative simplicity of this approach , NHS groups can hydrolyze over time , thus the ligands must be bioconjugated immediately after copolymerization . Furthermore , the hydrolysis Frontiers in Chemistry frontiersin . org 06 Wolfel et al . 10 . 3389 / fchem . 2022 . 1012443 of NHS groups results in charged carboxylic groups that can change hydrogel properties as explained above . 2 . 2 . 4 Hydroxyethyl acrylate Hydroxylated comonomers endow PAM gels with - OH moieties that are used to immobilize ligands by hydrogen bonding interactions ( Figure 1 . C8 ) . Diverse ligands can be attached since most biomolecules can participate in hydrogen bonding . However , the immobilization is not chemo - selective and generally is chemically weak , offering little control over ligand loading and stability . Note that hydrogen bonding interactions can be unstable to washing steps , or to changes in temperature or ionic strength . These aspects might be important for studies that require control over ligand density . Furthermore , hydroxyethyl acrylate ( HEA ) is inexpensive ( ~ 60 € per 1 L ) . PAM - HEA hydrogels have been modi ﬁ ed with ﬁ bronectin and laminin ( Grevesse et al . , 2014 ) and used to study how substrate area con ﬁ nement affects collective migration of cells ( Mohammed et al . , 2019 ) . 2 . 2 . 5 Methylsulfonyl acrylamides Comonomers bearing a methylsulfonyl ( MS ) group enable the chemo - speci ﬁ c covalent coupling of thiol - containing bioligands under physiological conditions ( 1 h , PBS , r . t . ) ( Figure 1 . C9 ) . In general , bioconjugating ligands through thiols renders higher site - selectivity compared to amine coupling since free thiols are much less naturally abundant in biomolecules . MS monomers were copolymerized at 2 mol % with AM and bis - AM by usual protocols . The swelling , porosity , and low protein adsorption of PAM - MS gels were comparable to that of PAM gels . ( Farrukh et al . , 2016 ) Biofunctionalization with thiol - containing bioligands was quantitative , reproducible and stable ; and retention of ligand ’ s bioactivity allowed speci ﬁ c recognition by cells . The performance of PAM - MS gels for bioconjugation has been compared with that of sulfo - SANPAH gels . ( Farrukh et al . , 2016 ) When both substrates were incubated in a bioligand solution of equal concentration , the immobilized ligand density on PAM - MS gels was three times higher compared to sulfo - SANPAH gels . Furthermore , PAM - MS gels only reacted with thiol - containing ligands while sulfo - SANPAH gels reacted with amino and thiol containing ligands demonstrating lower chemo - selectivity of the latter . Compared with PAM - MS gels , sulfo - SANPAH gels showed decreased concentration of bound RGD peptide , which impacted cell behavior by slowing down spreading kinetics and by decreasing ﬁ nal spreading area ( Figure 2C ) . This evidences that selective ligand coupling is an important factor to achieve conclusive studies over cell - materials interactions . Selective dual functionalization of PAM gels has been reported combining methylsulfonyl / thiol coupling with NHS ester / amine coupling ( Farrukh et al . , 2017a ; Paez et al . , 2018 ) . PAM gels were copolymerized with AA and MS comonomers . PAM - AA - MS gels enabled the orthogonal immobilization of polylysine and IKVAV peptide . Neuronal cells cultured on gels via sequential bifunctionalization exhibited higher maturation at comparable culture times than when both ligands were incubated simultaneously ( Farrukh et al . , 2017a ) . These reports have shown that functionalization of PAM gels with chemo - selective and quantitative coupling chemistries can impact retention of ligand biofunctionality and cell behavior . However , MS acrylamides are not commercially available , and their synthesis requires 4 - 5 steps , which reduces the user - friendliness of this approach for biology laboratories without synthetic capability . 2 . 3 Commercial poly ( acrylamide ) hydrogels Commercial PAM hydrogels have become available . PAM gels with different biochemical and biophysical properties and in diverse culture plate con ﬁ gurations are commercialized under the brand Softwell ® by Matrigen . ( Matrigen , 2022 ) Collagen - modi ﬁ ed and “ easy coat ” gels with controlled stiffness from E = 0 . 1 – 100 kPa are available . “ Easy coat ” gels contain quinone groups that can be used for covalent biofunctionalization by reacting with amine , thiols or other strong nucleophiles present in a ligand . Therefore , this approach presents poor chemo - selectivity and low control on site - speci ﬁ city of binding . The advantage of this strategy is the fast and user - friendly functionalization of the gels with biomolecules ; thus , these substrates might be convenient for certain cell studies . However , as frequently occurring with commercial systems , the exact chemical composition of the gels , ligand density , or the chemistry applied for ligand immobilization ( e . g . , collagen ) are undisclosed . The lack of information in composition , poor control over bioligand density and unsure retention of ligand ’ s functionality may lead to inconclusive results on cell culture results . Another limitation is the high cost of these substrates ( typically > 50 € per culture plate ) . 3 Discussion and perspectives In this mini review , diverse strategies for biofunctionalization of PAM hydrogels were introduced in the context of these biomaterials ’ usage for 2D cell culture . New users should select a convenient strategy after consideration of the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy , the existing capabilities in the laboratory and , most importantly , speci ﬁ c user ’ s needs in view of the biological question under investigation . The showcased methodologies present various levels of complexity , costs and requirement for Frontiers in Chemistry frontiersin . org 07 Wolfel et al . 10 . 3389 / fchem . 2022 . 1012443 especial equipment . Additionally , these strategies enable different degree of control over the loading density on the gels , as well as over stability and preserved bioactivity of the attached ligand . An overall qualitative comparison is presented in Figure 1D . Two main approaches were distinguished : those based on the direct activation of the side chains of PAM after FRP , and those where reactive comonomers are incorporated during FRP . In general , PAM direct activation strategies are based on the use of commercial reagents , use relatively simple ( although often harsh ) modi ﬁ cation conditions without the need of highly specialized equipment ( being thus more user - friendly ) . Unfortunately , they often offer limited control on the ligand loading , lower preservation of bioactivity and variable stability of the coating over time . Within strategies mediated by introduction of comonomers during FRP , the use of AA and MS - acrylamide comonomers are generally more chemically controlled , the latter being more chemo - speci ﬁ c and site - selective , ensuring good control of ligand loading and good preservation of ligand ’ s activity . However , MS - acrylamide strategy is more labour intensive and prohibitive for cell culture laboratories without organic synthesis infrastructure and expertise . Interestingly , we noticed that copolymerization strategies often do not report how the mechanical properties of the resulting functional PAM gels compare to pristine PAM gels . This could be a point of attention for future developments , to demonstrate to which extent a new methodology offers the possibility to independently tune mechanical from biochemical properties . Although out of the scope of this article , speci ﬁ c needs such as patterning of PAM or high throughput handling could be other aspects to consider . Several methodologies allow ligand patterning using various chemical strategies as shown in previous sections . ( Daliri et al . , 2021 ) Noteworthy , the introduction of photolabile comonomers into PAM has recently been exploited to dynamically and locally tune the mechanical ( Norris et al . , 2021 ) and cell - adhesive ( Missirlis et al . , 2022 ) properties of light - responsive PAM gels . In contrast , the realization of truly high throughput PAM systems is still in its infancy . Commercially available PAM gels might provide an answer to this need in the long term ; unfortunately , they are currently limited in their ligand options and are expensive . It is expected that more synthetic and fabrication efforts in the future will result in more robust , reproducible and high throughput solutions for biofunctionalized PAM hydrogels .
