Mini - Review Effects of Cytochalasin and Phalloidin on Actin John A . Cooper Departments of Biological Chemistry and Pathology , Washington University School of Medicine , St . Louis , Missouri 63110 C YTOCHALASINS and phalloidins are two groups of small , naturally occurring organic molecules that bind to actin and alter its polymerization . They have been widely used to study the role of actin in biological processes and as models for actin - binding proteins . Func - tionally , cytochalasins resemble capping proteins , which block an end of actin filaments , nucleate polymerization , and shorten filaments . No known actin - binding protein stabilizes actin filaments as phalloidin does , but such proteins may have been missed . Cytochalasin and phalloidin have also helped to elucidate fundamental aspects of actin polymeriza - tion . This review briefly summarizes older studies and con - centrates on recent v ~ rk on the mechanisms of action of cytochalasin and phalloidin . Cytochalasin Cytochalasins , a group of fungal metabolites , permeate cell membranes and cause cells to stop ruffling and translocating , round up ( 44 , 54 ) , become less stiff ( 12 ) , and enucleate ( 28 ) . In addition to binding actin , cytochalasins A and B also inhibit monosaccharide transport across the plasma mem - brane ; however , cytochalasins C , D , E , H , and 21 , 22 - dihydro - cytochalasin B do not ( 42 ) . Cytochalasin Binding to Actin Filaments . Cytochalasins bind to the barbed end of actin filaments , which inhibits both the association and dissociation of subunits at that end . The stoichiometry of binding is about one cytochalasin per actin filament ( 8 , 19 ) ; in these studies the filament number could not be determined accurately . Measurements of the affinity , based on different types of experiments , are compiled in Table I . The dissociation constant for binding ( Kd ) is determined with radiolabeled cytochalasin and characterizes the structural interaction between cytochalasin and actin . The inhibition constant ( K 0 is measured from the effect of cytochalasins on the growth or shortening of the barbed end of actin filaments . CD ~ is about 10 times more effective than CB . For both cytochalasins , the binding and inhibition constants agree fairly well , which shows that binding causes inhibition of polymer - ization and depolymerization . The inhibition constant for growth with ATP - actin is quite different from the others and varies with the actin monomer concentration ( 9 ) . These complications are probably at - tributable to the state of the nucleotide in the different experi - ments . The binding studies are performed with ATP - actin at steady state , where no net growth or shortening of filaments occurs . Actin monomers have mainly bound ATE and fila - 1 . Abbreviations used in thispaper : CB , cytochalasin B ; CD , cytochalasin D . merits have mainly ADP because the ATP hydrolyzes after the monomer adds to the filament . In the functional studies in ADP all of the actin molecules have bound ADP . In ATE free monomers will have bound ATP but the ends of the fila - ments can have either ATP , ADP , or a mixture of both , de - pending on the relative rates of subunit addition and ATP hy - drolysis . In experiments where the constants agree , the filament ends probably have bound ADP . Since the plot of apparent K ~ vs . ATP - actin monomer concentration has a positive curvature , CD may not bind at all to filaments with ATP - actin ends , so that the variable effect of CD may simply reflect the proportion of ADP - actin ends ( 9 ) . Alternatively , CD may induce dimerization of ATP - actin monomers , as dis - cussed in detail below . New experiments are needed to mea - sure the binding affinity for ATP - actin filaments , but the short lifetime of these filaments makes this technically dif - ficult . Electron microscopy of filaments grown from morpholog - ically identifiable seeds has revealed that the major effect of cytochalasin is at the barbed , as opposed to the pointed , end ( 4 , 36 ) . In a recent set of experiments 2 pM CB inhibited association and dissociation events only by 90 % , and 2 pM CD had a similar effect ( 4 ) . This interesting result should be confirmed by showing that the dependence of barbed end elongation on CD concentration exhibits a plateau at 90 % in - stead of 100 % inhibition . The rate constants for cytochalasin binding to barbed ends are of interest but have not been measured . If the 90 % inhibi - tion by 2 pM CB is due to 90 % binding , then the rates oT association and dissociation of CB must be at least compara - Table L Apparent Equilibrium Dissociation Constants of Binding and Inhibition for Cytochalasins and Actin Filaments K , ADP - Actin ATP - Actin K ~ Filament Filament Filament Filament Binding growth shortening growth shortening nM nM nM nM nM CB 5 - 40 40 40 200 - CD , , 02 1 - 2 1 - 2 2 - 35 + 2 The methods are discussed briefly in the text .

Some ( 14 , 30 ) , but not all ( 36 ) , studies find that cytochala - sin shortens actin filaments . The mechanism for shortening is unresolved because we lack both methods to measure fila - ment length and theories that combine all the factors that affect filament length . One interesting possibility is that cytochalasin can bind to a subunit in the interior of an actin filament and break the filament in two , called " severing . " An electron microscope assay for CB does not show the dra - matic shortening of filaments characteristic of severing by certain capping proteins ( 3 , 29 ) . Nevertheless , interruptions of long filaments are seen , which may represent capping of transient filament breaks induced by shear during the final stages of sample preparation ( 4 ) . Cytochalasin Binding to Actin Monomers and Dimers . Goddette and Frieden recently examined the binding of CD to monomeric actin and the formation of actin dimers , in - spired by the observations that cytochalasin increases the rate of spontaneous polymerization of actin monomers ( 45 ) and the rate of ATP hydrolysis by actin monomers ( 6 ) . The direct binding of CD to monomeric actin was measured with a sen - sitive assay for free CD ( 24 ) . In a nonpolymerizing buffer with Ca + + , the Kd is 18 ~ tM , and the stoichiometry is 1 : 1 . When Mg + + replaces Ca + + , the Kd is 2 . 6 IxM but the stoichi - ometry is strikingly unexpected : one CD per two actins , which suggests either that actin dimerizes or that half of the actin monomers are incapable of binding CD . Direct physi - cal evidence for dimer formation was obtained by small an - gle neutron scattering ( 27 ) . Without CD a moderate amount of dimers form over several hours in the presence of Mg + ยง In CD , dimers form more rapidly ( on a time scale consistent with the previous binding studies ) and to a greater extent . The rapid kinetics of cytochalasin binding and dimer for - mation were studied using actin labeled with fluorescent probes . AEDANS - actin was used to measure the binding of CD to monomeric actin ( 25 ) . The fluorescence of AEDANS - actin is higher with bound Mg + + than Ca + + , and addition of CD to Mg ยง leads to a decrease in fluorescence . The time course of the fluorescence decrease was monitored with stopped - flow techniques , as a function of the concentrations of CD , actin , and Ca + + . Changing the actin concentration has no effect , and so the fluorescence decrease is not due to dimerization . Taken together , the data are consistent with a theoretical model in which CD binds rapidly and loosely to an actin monomer , followed by a conformational change of the complex to a state where the CD is bound more tightly ( 25 ) . Pyrene - actin was used to study the kinetics of dimer for - mation ( 26 ) . Pyrene - actin cannot bind CD directly , hence fluorescence changes represent the formation of dimers or larger oligomers . The fluorescence of pyrene - actin filaments is 20 times that of monomers , and the time course of sponta - neous polymerization of monomers , in the absence of CD , has a characteristic sigmoidal shape , reflecting slow nuclea - tion and subsequent rapid elongation . In the presence of CD , several changes occur in the time course of fluorescence . The most obvious ones are that the lag phase is eliminated , inter - preted as accelerated nucleation , and that the final steady - state fluorescence is decreased , which implies a higher criti - cal monomer concentration ( 45 ) . Two subtle , rapid changes in fluorescence provide infor - mation about how actin dimers may form and act . Upon ad - cD / \ Figure 1 .

This uncertainty is not depicted . dition of CD and Mg + + , the fluorescence of pyrene - actin in - creases rapidly and then partially decreases more slowly ( 26 ) . The magnitudes of these changes are relatively small , and the changes occur before the large increase in fluores - cence attributable to filament formation . The initial fluores - cence increase is hypothesized to represent dimer formation . The kinetics of this rapid initial increase are predicted by a model in which CD and Mg + + bind to actin , induce dimer formation , and the dimer undergoes a conformation change to the high fluorescence state ( 26 ) . The dependence of the steady - state pyrene - actin fluorescence on the total actin con - centration provides additional evidence for the existence of oligomers induced by CD . In the presence of CD , plots of fluorescence vs . actin concentration are curved , in contrast to controls that have a characteristic sharp transition at the critical concentration ( 9 ) . Goddette and Frieden ( 26 ) propose a model that qualita - tively explains these new observations along with several im - portant older pieces of data ( Fig . 1 ) . When CD - actin dimers form , the actin contains bound ATP . The ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP , which causes the dimers to fall apart , generating a CD - actin monomer complex and a free actin with ADP . The CD - actin dimers are good nucleators , but CD - actin mono - mers are poor nucleators . A CD - actin monomer can bind an ATP - actin monomer to re - form a CD - actin dimer . The cycle repeats with hydrolysis of ATP and creation of an ADP - monomer . How does this model explain the data ? ( a ) Dimer forma - tion and dissociation explain the increase and subsequent de - crease of pyrene - actin fluorescence ( 26 ) . CD - actin dimers form in high concentration transiently because the molecules proceed synchronously through the first turnover of the cycle . ( b ) ATP is hydrolyzed by monomers and dimers , without the involvement of filaments , which explains the increased The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 105 , 1987 1474 rate of ATP hydrolysis by actin monomers in cytochalasin ( 6 ) . Also , the Mg + + dependence of dimer formation and po - lymerization predicts the Mg + + dependence of the ATPase . In the absence of Mg + + , CD does not cause dimer forma - tion or increase the ATPase . 100 - - 500 gM Mg + + suffices to form dimers ( 26 ) and increase the ATPase ( 6 , 34 ) . Greater than 1 mM Mg + + causes actin polymerization , and so mono - mers incorporate into filaments rather than form dimers . The model therefore predicts a lower ATPase , as observed by Low and Dancker ( 34 ) . ( c ) Cytochalasin is a poor nucleating agent , which is ex - plained in the model by some dimers dissociating instead of proceeding through nucleation . One might not need to in - voke dissociation to explain why CD - actin dimers are poor nucleators . CD - actin dimers should be poor nucleators be - cause they nucleate growth of actin filaments only in the pointed direction ( CD should cap the barbed end of the new filament ) . Although this consideration explains why CD - actin dimers are worse nucleators than actin dimers without CD , it does not explain why a given concentration of plasma gelsolin , which also nucleates growth in the pointed direc - tion , nucleates better than the same concentration of CD ( 45 ) . Plasma gelsolin probably binds actin monomers more tightly than does CD ( 13 ) , and so fewer dimers may form in CD than in gelsolin , which would account for the poor nucleating activity of CD . Also , CD - actin dimers may be structurally different from other dimers and thereby poor nucleators . To resolve this issue properly , one would like quantitative measurements of the concentration of CD - actin dimers and the fraction of dimers that dissociate or nucleate filament formation . ( d ) In CD the apparent critical concentration for polymer - ization is high . One expects a higher critical concentration simply because the barbed ends are capped ( the pointed end has a higher critical concentration than the barbed end in Mg + + ( 2 ) ) . Goddette and Frieden ( 26 ) find that the apparent critical concentration in CD is higher than that of the pointed end . Their model explains this difference qualitatively by the formation of ADP - actin monomers , which have a high criti - cal concentration ( 8 ~ tM under these conditions ) ( 41 ) . Al - though the ADP will exchange with free ATP in solution , the exchange may be slow enough that ADP - actin persists in ap - preciable concentrations . Slow nucleotide exchange can the - oretically predict a relatively high ADP - actin monomer con - centration for actin filament solutions at steady state ( 39 ) , and can explain the increase in critical concentration for sonicated actin ( 41 ) . The precise values of the on and off rate constants for nucleotides binding to actin monomers are not yet known but would permit a quantitative test of the model . The literature , however , disagrees as to whether the appar - ent critical concentration in CD really is higher than that of the pointed end ( measured as the apparent critical concentra - tion in plasma gelsolin ) . Results from Korn ' s laboratory show the same apparent critical concentration ( 4 IxM ) in CD and plasma gelsolin ( 9 , 13 ) , but results from Frieden ' s labo - ratory show a difference ( 26 , 45 ) . The experimental pro - tocols of the two laboratories differ in two major respects : ( a ) the actin is either monomeric or is prepolymerized to fila - ments at time zero , and ( b ) the time of incubation varies from 4 to 24 h . To understand this difference , we performed an ex - periment that compared the different conditions ( Table II ) ( K . Patane , J . A . Cooper , and C . Frieden , unpublished re - Table II .

The values in the table are from the plateau portion of the curve , which was at 5 gM CD and 0 . 5 gM plasma gelsolin .

At 24 h the data for filament and monomers are the same and the difference between CD and plasma gelsolin exists . Alternatively , the high apparent critical concentration in CD could be due to CD - actin monomers that do not poly - merize . An experiment that includes a range of actin con - centrations , however , would reflect this contribution with a characteristic shape in the plot of fluorescence vs . actin con - centration , as described for Acanthamoeba profilin ( 33 ) . This shape is not seen with CD ( 9 ) . In the future , the mechanism of action of cytochalasin on actin can be tested and elucidated with new experiments and complex modeling . New experiments are needed to address issues such as the rate of nucleotide exchange in Mg + + and CD because the slow release of ADP from monomers is a key feature of the model . Also , other measurements of the physical state of the actin would be important to confirm that the fluorescent probes accurately report the state of assem - bly . Testing the internal consistency of the complete mecha - nism with computer - assisted simulation will eventually be desirable when there is a complete set of data for one con - dition . Effects of Cytochalasin on Cells . To understand the role of actin in cell motility , one would like probes that are specific for actin and affect only one aspect of actin ' s poly - merization or interaction with other proteins . Although cytochalasins are the best available probes , they do not satisfy these criteria fully . Cytochalasin D is probably specific for actin . Although the possibility of CD having targets other than actin cannot be totally excluded , three kinds of evidence argue for speci - ficity . First , CD does not bind to the glucose transporter , as do some cytochalasins , including CB ( 42 ) , which should never be used to study cell motility . Binding of CD to other targets has not been reported . Of concern , however , are the observations that CD inhibits protein synthesis ( 40 ) and alters the impedance of membranes ( 43 ) . Second , the af - finity of CD for barbed ends is high ( Kd 2 nM ) , so it can be used in low concentrations to minimize nonspecific interac - tions . Despite this fact most experiments have used high con - centrations ( 2 gM ) . Third , other probes that interact with ac - Cooper Effects of Cytochalasin and Phalloidin on Actin 1475 tin have similar effects on cells . Microinjection of several unrelated capping proteins causes the same morphologic and functional effects on cells as CD ( 12 , 22 ) . The chance that all these probes have a mechanism other than actin must be quite low . If one grants that CD is specific , then an experiment where CD alters a cellular process implies that actin has some role in that process . This conclusion , although valuable , is lim - ited because of the multiple effects of CD on actin . The de - pendence of a cellular process on the CD concentration may distinguish its effects on barbed ends and monomers . The rate of permeation of CD across the plasma membrane and the rate of the cellular response must be rapid if such an ex - periment is to yield conclusive results . This approach has been used in some experiments . Low concentrations ( 0 . 2 ~ tM ) of CD inhibit membrane ruffling , which implicates growth or shortening of barbed ends ( 54 ) . The peripheral area of cells , where ruffles begin , contains actin filaments that are rapidly growing and shortening in a " treadmilling " fashion ( 48 ) . The treadmilling is constitutive , but ruffles only occur at certain places and times . Regulatory elements may control where and when treadmilling causes a ruffle to form . Higher concentrations ( 2 - 20 tiM ) are neces - sary to remove stress fibers ( 54 ) , which implicates CD as binding to monomers . Perhaps nucleation of new filaments removes actin subunits from stress fibers by mass action . The use of metabolic inhibitors prevents this effect ( 44 ) . Since CD binding to actin monomers and nucleating filament for - marion probably depends on ATP ( 21 , 24 ) , the effect of meta - bolic inhibitors may be to lower the ATP concentration and prevent those processes , Alternatively , loss of ATP may put the actomyosin in stress fibers into rigor , which decreases the rate at which actin subunits or filaments leave . On the other hand , several uncertainties about the in vitro mechanism limit the interpretation of experiments with cells . First , CD may not bind at all to barbed ends with ATP caps ( 9 ) . While ATP caps might not exist at steady state , they may exist when a filament grows rapidly , which can occur in cells ( 46 , 48 ) . Second , the Kd for monomer binding was deter - mined in low ionic strength and low Mg ยง concentrations , so the / G in ceils may be different . Third , cells have high con - centrations ( 100 liM ) of nonfllamentous actin ( 5 ) , most of which is probably bound to profilin or other proteins . Inter - actions of CD with this actin pool are unknown . Even if monomer and filament binding can be distin - guished by cytochalasin concentration dependence , each type of binding has several inseparable effects on actin poly - merization . Capping barbed ends will inhibit both growth and shortening of filaments , and it will also increase the criti - cal concentration since barbed and pointed ends probably have different critical concentrations in cells . Monomer binding leads to nucleation of filament formation as well as a higher critical concentration ( Fig . 1 ) . Another complicat - ing factor is that cytochalasin may compete with cellular cap - ping proteins for barbed ends . One can argue that the barbed end of all actin filaments in cells must be capped , otherwise the ends will constantly depolymerize ( 32 ) . Since CD would competitively inhibit the binding of capping proteins to barbed ends , its effects may represent the loss of a capping protein that specifies the location or function of the filament . In the face of all this uncertainty , what can one say about what cytochalasin does to actin in cells ? The surest conclu - sion is that CD caps barbed ends . Cytochalasin inhibits growth of acrin filaments in two model systems ( 16 , 46 ) . In these systems , the pointed ends are probably capped , and the barbed ends grow , although this point is not proven . The widely held idea that cytochalasin depolymerizes actin illa - ments is certainly not true in general . One expects a slight increase in critical concentration due to capping barbed ends and dimer formation ( Fig . 1 ) , but the quantity of this increase is only a few percent of the amount of the actin filaments . In fibroblasts , cytochalasin causes no change in the ratio of filamentous to nonfilamentous actin ( 38 ) . Cytochalasin does prevent or reverse the increase in filamentous actin that ac - companies platelet activation , but it does not decrease the filamentous actin in resting platelets ( 10 , 20 ) . Cytochalasin disrupts the supramolecular organization of actin filaments , but the relation of this phenomenon to the in vitro mecha - nism is unclear . Electron microscopy shows that actin fila - ments persist in cytochalasin ; their organization changes from an isotropic network to focal accumulations ( 44 ) . Sev - ering actin filaments might explain this transition , but the severing activity of cytochalasin is weak ( 4 ) . Alternatively , competition of cytochalasin with capping proteins for barbed ends may cause this change . If actin filaments are normally held in place by capping proteins that bind to their barbed ends , cytochalasin may release the filaments and allow them to be contracted into foci . The observation that stress fibers sometimes contract in cytochalasin , as though their mem - brane attachments were lost ( 54 ) , also supports this hy - pothesis . Phalloidin Phallotoxins are a group of bicyclic heptapeptides from poi - sonous mushrooms ( 51 ) . The major representative of this group , phalloidin , binds to actin filaments much more tightly than to actin monomers ( 17 ) and shifts the equilibrium be - tween filaments and monomers toward filaments , lowering the critical concentration for polymerization by 10 - to 30 - fold under various conditions ( 17 , 18 ) . The lower critical con - centration is due to a decrease in the rate constant for the dis - sociation of actin subunits from filament ends ( 11 , 17 ) . The dissociation rate constants at both the barbed and pointed ends are lower than the error in the measurement ( 0 . 01 s - t ) , so the actual magnitude of the change is uncertain but consis - tent with the effect on the critical concentration . The associa - tion rate constant at the pointed end does not change , but at the barbed end it decreases ( the opposite of what is expected for a critical concentration decrease ) by 20 % ( 11 ) . For filaments the stoichiometry of binding is one phal - loidin for either one or two actin protomers . A 1 : 1 value was inferred from the amount of phaUoidin needed to protect actin filaments against depolymerization ( 15 ) and binding measured by difference spectroscopy ( 52 ) . Another group found that a 1 : 2 ratio was sufficient to provide maximal pro - tection against depolymerization , and in a pelleting assay with Scatchard analysis the stoichiometry was 1 : 1 . 7 with a Kd of 85 nM ( 37 ) . This difference is difficult to resolve ; the designs of the two sets of experiments are different , and the extinction coefficients and purity of the phalloidin and actin may be different . In experiments measuring the binding of radioactive phalloidin to liver plasma membranes , which probably reflects binding to actin filaments , a high affinity site of 22 nM was found . By displacement , the dissociation The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 105 , 1987 1476 rate constant was 3 . 8 (cid:141) 10 - 3 s - I , and the association rate constant was calculated to be 0 . 17 gM - ~ s - t ( 35 ) . Photoac - tivatable derivatives of phalloidin , bound to actin filaments , react covalently with amino acids Glu - llT , Met - ll9 , and Met - 355 ( 47 ) , which are very close to the nucleotide binding site ( 1 ) . Fluorescent derivatives of phalloidin have been extremely useful for localizing actin filaments in living and fixed cells ( 50 , 53 ) and visualizing individual actin filaments in vitro ( 55 ) . If saturating quantities of fluorescent phalloidin are used , then the fluorescence is a quantitative measure of the amount of filamentous actin in cells . In this approach , the fluorescence of single cells is measured with a fluorescence - activated cell sorter , or the fluorescence of a methanol extract of a group of cells is measured with a fluorometer ( 31 ) . The effects of phalloidin on actin are easy to interpret : it should prevent filament depolymerization and shift the equi - librium from monomer toward filament . Phalloidins , how - ever , do not permeate cell membranes and have therefore not been very useful in experiments with living cells . They are taken up by many cells , probably by pinocytosis , and are avidly taken up by hepatocytes by an unknown mechanism ( 51 ) . Cells treated with phalloidins show a variety of toxic effects and often die . While this toxicity could be mediated by actin , it raises the question of whether phalloidin has other targets , since cells treated with CD do not die . Phal - loidin - treated cells have increased amounts of actin asso - ciated with their plasma membranes ( 23 ) , and the microin - jection of phalloidin into living cells alters actin distribution and cell motility ( 49 ) .
