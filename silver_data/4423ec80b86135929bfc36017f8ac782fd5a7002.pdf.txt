It can sever actin filaments , accelerate filament disassembly , act as a nucleation factor , recruit or antagonize other actin regulators , and control the pool of polymerization - competent actin monomers . In cells these actions have complex functional outputs . The timing and localization of cofilin activity are carefully regulated , and thus global , long - term perturbations may not be sufficient to probe its precise function . To better understand cofilin’s spatiotemporal action in cells , we imple - mented chromophore - assisted laser inactivation ( CALI ) to instantly and specifically inactivate it . In addition to globally inhibiting actin turnover , CALI of cofilin generated several profound effects on the lamellipodia , including an increase of F - actin , a rearward expansion of the actin network , and a reduction in retrograde flow speed . These results support the hypothesis that the principal role of cofilin in lamellipodia at steady state is to break down F - actin , control filament turnover , and regulate the rate of retrograde flow . INTRODUCTION The actin cytoskeleton is regulated by a complex network of regula - tory molecules that act on distinct aspects of filament assembly and disassembly , including filament nucleation , severing , cross - linking , and end capping , as well as monomer sequestering and localization ( Dent and Gertler , 2003 ; Dent et al . , 2011 ) . Many studies on the regulation of actin in migrating cells depend on long - term modifica - tions of protein level or activity through knockdown and overexpres - sion . Because most actin regulators are involved in the fundamental structure and function of the cytoskeleton , an essential component of cell viability , long - term manipulations may be marred by compen - satory mechanisms , making it difficult to accurately interpret their results . Moreover , these actin - binding proteins are tightly regulated in space and time , and thus understanding their specific function in cellular events requires spatiotemporal information . The need to determine the functional consequences of localized , instantaneous changes in protein activity has spurred the development of light - mediated techniques to activate or knock down a protein’s function . Chromophore - assisted laser inactivation ( CALI ) is a loss - of - func - tion technique in which proteins are inactivated with light by irradi - ating an attached photosensitizer chromophore . The chromophore generates reactive photoproducts that are highly destructive but short lived , thus only affecting the protein to which the chromophore is directly adjacent . CALI allows one to perform instantaneous pro - tein loss - of - function analysis with subcellular precision ( Jacobson et al . , 2008 ) . One issue with CALI has been in the labeling of the target protein ; adding agents that label motifs other than the target can lead to nonspecific collateral damage . A major advance in this area occurred when it was shown that fluorescent proteins can be used as CALI photosensitizers ( Rajfur et al . , 2002 ) , as the CALI target could be covalently labeled with a genetically encoded chro - mophore . The pitfall in using fluorescent proteins for CALI has been that they are relatively weak photosensitizers in comparison to other CALI chromophores and thus require a large dose of light that must be delivered by high - powered lasers not found in most imaging systems ( Rajfur et al . , 2002 ; Vitriol et al . , 2007 ) .

Our data with CALI support the hypothesis that cofilin’s principal role in the lamellipodia is to break down actin filaments and control the rate of retrograde flow . RESULTS Labeling cofilin with KillerRed does not alter its localization to actin We made DNA constructs in which human cofilin1 ( termed cofilin for the rest of the article ) , cofilin S3A ( active and cannot be phospho - rylated ) , or cofilin S3E ( inactive , cannot bind actin ; Moriyama et al . , 1996 ) is labeled with the fluorescent protein photosensitizer KillerRed ( KR ; Bulina et al . , 2006 ) . An issue in any study using KR is whether it will affect the physiology of the protein to which it is at - tached . KR is an obligate dimer ( Bulina et al . , 2006 ; Pletnev et al . , 2009 ) ; historically , multimer fluorescent proteins have been poor la - beling reagents because they often cause mislocalization or aggre - gation when expressed . We thus examined the cellular distribution of cofilin - KR with respect to F - actin , which was labeled with Lifeact – enhanced green fluorescent protein ( EGFP ; Riedl et al . , 2008 ) . We observed that both wild - type ( WT ) and S3A mutant of cofilin - KR did localize appropriately to actin within the cell , including to the lamellipodia ( Figure 1 ) . S3E exhibited a diffuse pattern , which is con - sistent with its inability to bind actin cytoskeleton . As previously shown for endogenous cofilin by immunostaining ( Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) , WT cofilin - KR was excluded from the first 1 – 2 μm of the lamellipodia , whereas S3A occupied the entire lamellipodial re - gion ( Figure 1B ) . We further verified that KR did not alter cofilin lo - calization by coexpressing it with the well - characterized cofilin - EGFP ( Huang et al . , 2008 ) . The two constructs showed identical localiza - tion within the cell ( Figure 1C ) . We also assessed the intracellular mobility of cofilin - KR and cofilin - EGFP with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) . Both showed identical turnover rates and immobile fractions ( Figure 1D and Supplemental Figure S1 ) . Coupled with the results discussed later , we conclude that cofilin can be effectively labeled with KR without altering its localization or activity and behaves similarly to other widely used fluorescent pro - tein – tagged cofilin in cells . CALI of cofilin reduces actin mobility To show that CALI of cofilin - KR can reduce its enzymatic activity , we performed an in vivo assay that measures cofilin - dependent actin filament severing . Previously , it was shown that cofilin regulates the mobile pool of actin in the cell ( Kiuchi et al . , 2007 ) . Using a photo - activatable fluorescent protein – tagged actin construct , Kiuchi et al . ( 2007 ) demonstrated that when cofilin activity was reduced , so was the diffusion of actin away from a photoactivated region . This mobi - lization of actin was dependent on the filament - severing ability of cofilin . We sought to reproduce these data with CALI . To do this , we performed experiments in which cofilin - KR constructs were coex - pressed with photoactivatable GFP – β - actin ( hereafter referred to as PA - GFP - actin ) . A 10 - μm cytoplasmic region was photoactivated be - fore and after irradiation of KR ( Figure 2A and Supplemental Movie S1 ) . We observed a significant reduction in the mobility of PA - GFP - actin after CALI with cofilin - KR , as evidenced by assessing the aver - age time for the PA - GFP - actin fluorescence to decay to 50 % of the initial value ( τ 1 / 2 ) . After irradiation of cofilin - KR , τ 1 / 2 nearly tripled , from 7 . 9 ± 0 . 9 to 21 . 7 ± 7 . 0 s ( Figure 2 , B and C ) . We also saw a marked decrease in actin mobility after cofilin S3A - KR was irradiated , although CALI of cofilin - KR had a more pronounced effect ( Figure 2C ) . Irradiation of KR by itself or cofilin S3E - KR caused no change in abated with the generation of KillerRed , a fluorescent protein pho - tosensitizer that can be efficiently used for CALI with more than an order - of - magnitude less light than other fluorescent proteins ( Bulina et al . , 2006 ) . Here we use KillerRed to inactivate the actin regulatory protein cofilin1 . The actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin family of proteins is a highly conserved group of actin regulatory molecules composed of ADF , cofilin1 , and cofilin2 ( Bernstein and Bamburg , 2010 ) . Cofilin was once characterized by its ability to increase the rate of actin fila - ment depolymerization by stimulating dissociation of actin from the pointed end ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ) . Its principal role in actin regula - tion , however , appears to be through filament severing ( Maciver et al . , 1991 ; Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ) . Severing is be - lieved to occur primarily at the bare and cofilin - decorated filament boundary ( Suarez et al . , 2011 ) and at regions of mechanical discon - tinuity caused by cofilin - dependent changes in actin structure and rigidity ( Elam et al . , 2013 ) . In addition to severing , cofilin itself can act as a nucleation factor at high concentrations ( micromolar range ; Chen et al . , 2004 ; Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ) , induce phosphate release from F - actin ( Blanchoin and Pollard , 1999 ; Suarez et al . , 2011 ) , change filament rigidity ( McCullough et al . , 2011 ) , and remodel filament structure ( Pfaendtner et al . , 2010 ; Galkin et al . , 2011 ; Fan et al . , 2013 ) , although some of these effects are inter - twined with its severing activity . Whereas cofilin - induced filament severing leads to actin disas - sembly in a variety of actin structures ( Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ; Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ; Breitsprecher et al . , 2011 ; Henty et al . , 2011 ) , in the lamellipodia it can have opposite functional out - puts . Severing was initially believed to break down actin networks and turn over filaments ( Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) . It also was later shown , however , that cofilin - mediated filament severing could in - crease filament polymerization by creating new barbed ends ( Ichetovkin et al . , 2002 ) , which is the preferential site of actin mono - mer addition . These new barbed ends , together with other factors that stimulate nucleation , polymerization , and stabilization of actin filaments , could lead to actin network growth and leading - edge protrusions ( DesMarais et al . , 2004 ; Ghosh et al . , 2004 ) . Cofilin fila - ment severing may also promote actin assembly at the leading edge by increasing the pool of polymerization - competent ATP - actin monomers ( Kiuchi et al . , 2007 ) , which involves a number of other factors to release cofilin and promote nucleotide exchange . This bimodal effect of cofilin on actin is tightly controlled by limiting co - filin activity to specific times and places in the cell through a com - plex , multilayered array of signaling cascades ( Oser and Condeelis , 2009 ) . As a result , a better elucidation of cofilin’s function in regulat - ing actin dynamics requires tools that can manipulate its activity with spatiotemporal precision . A chemically engineered light - sensitive analogue of cofilin was made to address the importance of spatiotemporal cofilin activa - tion . In a series of seminal experiments , it was shown that local acti - vation of cofilin at the cell edge polymerized actin and generated protrusions ( Ghosh et al . , 2004 ) . This provided strong support for the hypothesis that cofilin promoted actin polymerization rather than filament disassembly . Unfortunately , photoactivatable cofilin was not widely used after the initial study , most likely because it re - quired microinjection of a chemically modified protein into cells and ultraviolet light for uncaging ( Ghosh et al . , 2002 ) . In this article , we describe a means of inactivating cofilin with a standard laser scan - ning confocal microscope using KillerRed - CALI . We define param - eters that make CALI of KillerRed cofilin successful and show that CALI is specific and does not cause collateral photodamage . We use CALI to demonstrate that instantaneous inactivation of cofilin in 2240 | E . A . Vitriol et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell whole - cell CALI by expressing cofilin - KR , cofilin S3A - KR , and cofil - in S3E - KR in Cath . a differentiated ( CAD ) cells together with Lifeact - EGFP . Peripheral F - actin was quantified with an automated image analysis routine in which the edge of the cell was identified and then fluorescence intensity was measured inward ( see Materials and Methods and Supplemental Figure 3 ) . Cells expressing cofilin S3A - KR showed a dramatic increase in F - actin after CALI , with the lamellipo - dial actin network growing backward toward the cell center ( Figure 3 and Supplemental Movie 2 ) . This result closely resembled the phenotype found in Drosophila S2 cells after cofilin depletion with RNA interference ( RNAi ; Iwasa and Mullins , 2007 ) . The most signifi - cant increase in lamellipodial F - actin occurred 3 – 4 μm behind the leading edge ( Figure 3 , B and C ) , supportive of the hypothesis that cofilin’s major role is in turning over actin filaments at the back of the lamellipodia . Similar results were observed when EGFP - actin was used to highlight the lamellipodia ( Supplemental Figure 4 ) , indicat - ing that the observed changes in lamellipodial F - actin after CALI were not a result of increased Lifeact binding to the F - actin vacated by inactivated cofilin S3A - KR . Cells expressing cofilin - KR , the inactive cofilin S3E - KR , or KR by itself , however , showed no obvious change in actin mobility ( Figure 2C ) , demonstrating that KR must be attached to cofilin and that cofilin must be bound to actin for the reduced actin mobility to occur . As an additional control , we used mono - meric red fluorescent protein ( mRFP ) to CALI cofilin . mRFP is not as efficient at generating reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) as KR ( Waldeck et al . , 2012 ) , and thus the effect of CALI on actin mobility should be reduced , given the same dose of light . In support of this , CALI of cofilin - mRFP resulted in only a small decrease in actin mobility ( τ 1 / 2 changed from 6 . 0 ± 0 . 9 to 8 . 2 ± 1 . 3 s after CALI ) . There was also no effect after CALI of cofilin S3A - mRFP or cofilin S3E - mRFP ( Supplemen - tal Figure S2 ) . From these data , we concluded that CALI of cofilin - KR is specific , effective , and works by reducing cofilin’s ability to sever actin filaments . This conclusion is consistent with work show - ing that cofilin has reduced actin - binding and - severing activity when exposed to ROS ( Klemke et al . , 2008 ; Klamt et al . , 2009 ) . CALI of cofilin S3A increases F - actin in the lamellipodia and decreases the rate of retrograde flow We next sought to use CALI to investigate cofilin’s role in regulating the structure and dynamics of actin in lamellipodia . We conducted FIGURE 1 : Labeling cofilin with KillerRed does not alter its subcellular localization or turnover .

Volume 24 July 15 , 2013 Instant cofilin loss increases F - actin | 2241 increase in retrograde flow speed after CALI of cofilin S3E - KR ( Figure 4C ) . Cofilin S3A outcompetes wild - type cofilin for lamellipodia localization The lack of any phenotype in the lamelli - podia after CALI of wild - type cofilin was perplexing . It is of note that these experi - ments were performed by overexpressing KR constructs . Endogenous cofilin is not labeled with a photosensitizer chromo - phore , and thus it cannot be inactivated with light . It is possible that cofilin S3A - KR preferentially binds to actin in the lamelli - podia , excluding endogenous cofilin , and creates a local concentration of inactivat - able protein that is sufficient to produce a loss - of - function effect after CALI . To ad - dress this , we performed CALI of cofil - in S3A while expressing wild - type cofilin - EGFP . If cofilin S3A were preferentially binding to the actin in the lamellipodia , we would expect to see an increase in wild - type cofilin after CALI of cofilin S3A . After irradiation of cofilin - KR , there was indeed a significant increase of cofilin - EGFP localization to the lamellipodia ( Figure 5A ) . This result also provides ad - ditional evidence that cofilin - binding sites , as well as the immediate binding partners of cofilin that could be affected by collateral damage , are not being de - stroyed by irradiation of cofilin S3A - KR , since wild - type cofilin is still recruited to the lamellipodia after CALI . To be sure that the increase in wild - type cofilin localization was not a general , non - specific effect from increasing F - actin after CALI , we performed CALI of cofilin S3A - KR while expressing another leading - edge actin - binding protein , coronin1B . CALI of cofilin S3A - KR caused a small depletion of Coronin1B from the lamellipodia ( Figure 5B ) . Thus actin regulators are not simply being recruited to the lamellipodia en masse due to the increase in F - actin levels after CALI of cofilin S3A . This indicates that the increase in cofilin - EGFP to lamellipodia is in fact due to its occupation of binding sites left vacant by inactivated cofilin S3A . Knockdown of endogenous cofilin allows for effects in lamellipodia after CALI of wild - type cofilin Although the S3A / wild - type cofilin competition assay explained why CALI of cofilin S3A - KR is effective in overexpression experiments , it did not address the issue of whether the loss - of - function pheno - types seen in lamellipodia after CALI cofilin S3A - KR are the result of creating an artificial environment with abnormally high levels of ac - tive cofilin . To address this , we performed cofilin - KR CALI experi - ments in cells in which endogenous cofilin had been stably knocked down with short hairpin RNAi ( shRNAi ; Figure 6 , A and B ) . We were able to achieve ∼ 89 % cofilin1 knockdown ( Figure 6B ) . Cofilin knock - down ( cofilin KD ) cells displayed significantly reduced actin mobility ( Figure 6C ) , as expected from our CALI experiments ( Figure 2 ) and previous work ( Kiuchi et al . , 2007 ) . This phenotype was rescued with expression of cofilin - KR ( cofilin knockdown / rescue [ KD / R ] in lamellipodial F - actin quantity or distribution ( Figure 3C and Supple - mental Figure S5 ) . We also used a semiautomated analysis routine using kymographs to validate our findings ( Supplemental Figure S6 ) . Kymograph analysis allowed us to include more cells in the analysis because we were able to isolate protruding regions of cells that did not have lamellipodia around their entire periphery . Kymo - graph analysis also revealed a large and significant increase in F - actin after CALI of cofilin S3A - KR and no obvious change after CALI of cofilin - KR or KR by itself . It did show a small but significant decrease in F - actin after CALI cofilin S3E - KR ( Supplemental Figure S7 ) . The complete lack of change in F - actin in the lamellipodia after CALI of WT - cofilin was unexpected because it yielded the most significant changes to actin monomer mobility ( Figure 2 ) . The increase in F - actin in lamellipodia after CALI of cofilin S3A - KR appeared to be accompanied by a decrease in the rate of actin ret - rograde flow ( Supplemental Movie S2 ) . We thus measured the retro - grade flow of activated PA - GFP - actin in lamellipodia before and af - ter irradiation of cofilin - KR ( Figure 4A ) . Consistent with other results showing that cofilin activation increases retrograde flow ( Delorme et al . , 2007 ; Zhang et al . , 2012 ) , we saw a marked increase in flow rate when cells were overexpressing constitutively active cofilin S3A , which was significantly reduced by ∼ 44 % ( 56 ± 4 . 0 to 37 ± 3 . 5 nm / s ) after CALI ( Figure 4 , B and C ) . In cells expressing either cofilin - KR or KR alone , no change was observed after CALI ; there was a slight FIGURE 2 : CALI of cofilin reduces actin filament turnover and monomer mobility .

A . Vitriol et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell label F - actin . 3D - SIM imaging confirmed the increase in the size of the lamellipodia ( Figure 7 and Supplemental Movie S3 ) and revealed the presence of long filaments in - terspersed throughout it . Again , these data support the hypothesis that cofilin works in lamellipodia to sever actin filaments to turn them over , restrict the size of lamellipodia , and control the rate of retrograde flow . DISCUSSION CALI offers a rare opportunity to compare the same cells with and without a key target protein without the complication of mole - cular compensation , akin to using a specific inhibitor . In this study we implemented a fluorescent protein – based CALI approach that uses the efficient photosensitizer KillerRed , allowing one to selectively and instantly inactivate cofilin1 . This work pro - vides arguably the first demonstration of cofilin’s real - time regulation of actin turn - over in living cells . Consistent with previous studies ( Hotulainen et al . , 2005 ; Iwasa and Mullins , 2007 ) , our results confirm that co - filin’s primary role in regulating the steady state of lamellipodia is to disassemble F - actin and regulate filament turnover , as CALI of cofilin causes an immediate increase of F - actin there . Several pieces of evidence in - dicate that the F - actin increase is caused by a decrease of filament disassembly and not from the formation of new filaments . First , the increase in F - actin occurs primarily 3 – 4 μm behind the leading edge . Second , 3D - SIM imaging reveals the presence of numerous longer filaments interspersed throughout the lamellipodia after CALI ( Figure 7 ) . Finally , the increase in wild - type cofilin localization after CALI of cofilinS3A ( Figure 5 ) indicates that existing filaments are elongating , since wild - type cofilin preferen - tially binds aged , ADP - actin filaments rather than newly polymer - ized actin ( Yeoh et al . , 2002 ) . It was also interesting to see that CALI of cofilin resulted in im - mediate slowdown of F - actin retrograde flow . This finding is consis - tent with a recent study demonstrating an essential role for ADF / cofilin in regulating retrograde flow in neurogenesis ( Flynn et al . , 2012 ) and other studies showing an increase in retrograde flow downstream of cofilin activation ( Delorme et al . , 2007 ; Zhang et al . , 2012 ) . Of importance , the decrease in retrograde flow rate suggests that the increase of F - actin at the back of the lamellipodia actin net - work after cofilin CALI is not simply a result of more F - actin being moved backward but instead is caused by loss of filament disassem - bly . In vitro it has been shown that filament severing by cofilin sto - chastically alters filament dynamics to favor turnover ( Michelot et al . , 2007 ) and can turn over branched actin networks in bulk ( Reymann et al . , 2011 ) . Increasing the dynamic nature of the actin network in lamellipodia downstream of cofilin activity via enhanced filament turnover and retrograde flow appears to be important for protrusion formation and cell motility ( Hotulainen et al . , 2005 ; Delorme et al . , 2007 ; Zhang et al . , 2012 ) , although the inverse has also been shown during growth cone guidance ( Wen et al . , 2007 ) . The differences Figure 6C ) . As with the case of cofilin - KR CALI in cells in which it is overexpressed , CALI of cofilin - KR caused a substantial reduction in actin mobility / filament turnover ( Figure 6C ) . Contrary to overexpression experiments , CALI of cofilin - KR in KD / R cells resulted in a significant increase in F - actin in the lamel - lipodia ( Figure 6D ) , as well as a significant reduction in the rate of retrograde flow ( Figure 6E ) . These results mirrored those found in experiments in which cofilin S3A - KR was overexpressed , further indicating that CALI cofilin S3A - KR was effective in lamellipodia be - cause it outcompetes endogenous cofilin for binding there ( Figure 5A ) and not because it creates an artificial pre - CALI environment . The requirement for knockdown / rescue for cofilin - KR provides critical evidence that CALI of cofilin in lamellipodia is specific . Live - cell superresolution imaging demonstrates an increase in lamellipodial F - actin after CALI of cofilin To provide greater detail about how CALI of cofilin alters the struc - ture of lamellipodia , we performed CALI of cofilin - KR in cofilin - KD cells together with live - cell three - dimensional structured illumina - tion microscopy ( 3D - SIM ) . 3D - SIM allows one to double the resolu - tion of light microscopy to ∼ 100 nm , is compatible with commonly used fluorophores , and allows for fast - imaging speeds ( Schermelleh et al . , 2010 ) . For these experiments , we also used Lifeact - EGFP to FIGURE 3 : CALI of cofilin S3A increases F - actin in the lamellipodia .

Volume 24 July 15 , 2013 Instant cofilin loss increases F - actin | 2243 here may lie in the amount of cofilin activa - tion and specific context in which it is activated . We do not feel that our data conflict with models in which cofilin filament sever - ing is used to create barbed ends and polymerize new actin ( Oser and Condeelis , 2009 ) . Much work has been done to show that the polymerization - inducing aspect of cofilin activity is limited to small subcellular compartments downstream of local signal - ing events . Furthermore , to be fully effec - tive , cofilin - induced actin polymerization requires a synergy with nucleation factors such as Arp 2 / 3 ( Ichetovkin et al . , 2002 ) . Filament severing by cofilin also stimulates actin assembly downstream of extracellular signals by increasing the monomer pool ( Kiuchi et al . , 2007 ) . It is also certainly plau - sible that localized cofilin - induced polym - erization can occur simultaneously with co - filin - induced filament breakdown and turnover , depending on the specific envi - ronment in which cofilin is activated . One piece of evidence in our data supporting the dual role of cofilin is that simply overex - pressing cofilin S3A increases F - actin in la - mellipodia ( Supplemental Figure S8 ) , which coincides with its role in promoting F - actin polymerization . However , global inactiva - tion of cofilin S3A with CALI causes F - actin to increase even more ( Figure 3 ) , which supports its role in disassembling actin fila - ments . Unfortunately , due to the extremely rapid turnover of cofilin ( Figure 1E and Supplemental Figure S1 ) , we were not able to locally inactivate cofilin to perform the reciprocal experiment of local cofilin pho - toactivation ( Ghosh et al . , 2004 ) . Even pulse irradiating a 5 - μm region of the leading edge led to complete photo - bleaching of KR throughout the cell before a gradient could be achieved . It is possible that increased laser power could be used to generate a local phenotype , but based on the mobility of cofilin , it would require an irradiation radius of at least 20 μm ( Vitriol et al . , 2007 ) . With this work we demonstrate a spe - cific , instantaneous inactivation of cofilin1 using genetically encoded constructs and a standard laser scanning confocal micro - scope . Because use of KR to inactivate tar - get proteins has been rather limited since its debut , we hope that this article will pro - vide useful ideas and considerations that will make potential KR - CALI experiments a success . We provided extensive data showing that the KR inactivation of cofilin was specific , including irradiation of KR by itself , CALI of an inactive form of cofilin , use of a less powerful photosensitizer to FIGURE 4 : CALI of cofilin S3A decreases retrograde flow of F - actin in the lamellipodia . ( A ) Schematic showing how retrograde flow rates are obtained . The first four images depict a cell in which PA - GFP - actin has been photoactivated in the cytoplasm . PA - GFP - actin then travels to leading edge , becomes incorporated into the lamellipodia , and gets pulled backward by retrograde flow . A kymograph is made from a region of the lamellipodia ( red line ) , and retrograde flow speed is obtained by measuring the diagonal path of actin ( black - dotted arrow ) , which represents distance over time . ( B ) Representative kymographs of PA - GFP - actin before and after CALI of cofilin S3A - KR . There is a significant reduction in retrograde flow speed after CALI .

The number of cells and before / after kymographs used for this analysis is as follows : KR ( 7 , 32 / 30 ) , cof - KR ( 8 , 37 / 31 ) , cof S3A - KR ( 9 , 39 / 29 ) , and cof S3E - KR ( 8 , 33 / 34 ) . * * p < 0 . 0001 , * p < 0 . 05 ( Student’s t test ) .

Molecular Biology of the Cell others did not ( Rajfur et al . , 2002 ) . We showed that cofilin S3A has a dominant ef - fect on binding actin in the lamellipodia , excluding WT - cofilin ( Figure 5 ) . There may be other examples in which CALI of overex - pressed cofilin S3A will be successful . It is also of interest that CALI of cofilin S3E had an opposite effect on the actin of the lamel - lipodia to that of cofilin S3A or WT - cofilin in the KD / R experiments ( Figure 5 and Sup - plemental Figure S7 ) . Although it is often believed to be inert because it is not able to bind actin ( Moriyama et al . , 1996 ) , there clearly was a cofilin S3E overexpression phe - notype on the F - actin content of the lamel - lipodia ( Supplemental Figure S8 ) . In addi - tion , FRAP analysis revealed that cofilin S3E has a significantly lower mobile fraction than wild - type cofilin or cofilin S3A ( Supple - mental Figure S1 ) . Taking our results to - gether , our interpretation of this is that co - filin S3E is binding an activator of cofilin , which is then released upon CALI to acti - vate the endogenous cofilin pool . This is also an important example of how multiple controls must be done and carefully as - sessed to confer CALI specificity . Through specific and instantaneous in - activation of cofilin at the whole - cell level , we were able to show its principal role in regulating filament turnover , the size of the lamellipodia , and the speed of retrograde flow . As KR - CALI is further developed , we hope to reveal more intricacies of cofilin and how it regulates actin in various cellular processes , including the dynamics of growth cone motility ( Wen et al . , 2007 ) and the formation and maintenance of the neu - romuscular junction ( Lee et al . , 2009 ) . We believe that we have shown that KR - CALI , in addition to being of great use for deter - mining the spatiotemporal function of co - filin , is a generally accessible technique and an important addition to the cell biolo - gist’s toolbox . MATERIALS AND METHODS DNA constructs Cofilin - KR and its mutant forms were made by subcloning KR from pKillerRed - N ( Evrogen , Moscow , Russia ) into cofilin - GFP constructs that had been previously subcloned into the pcDNA3 . 1 + expression vector ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . The following additional DNA con - structs were used in this study : Lifeact - EGFP ( pN1 - Lifeact - EGFP ; pro - vided by Roland Wedlich - Soldner , Max - Planck Institute of Biochem - istry , Martinsried , Germany ) , PA - GFP - actin ( pC1 PA - GFP - β - actin ) , EGFP - γ - actin ( pCS2 + - GFP - γ - actin ) , and EGFP - coronin1B ( pLL5 . 1 EGFP - coronin1B , provided by James Bear ( University of North Caro - lina at Chapel Hill , Chapel Hill , NC ) . DNA constructs were prepared using Endotoxin - free Maxi Prep kits ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) . Cell culture CAD cells were cultured in DMEM / F12 ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) supplemented with 8 % fetal bovine serum ( Atlanta Biologicals , show dose dependence ( Supplemental Figure S2 ) , demonstration that cofilin - binding sites were not being destroyed with CALI ( Figure 5 ) , and demonstration of the requirement of knockdown / rescue for WT - cofilin . The knockdown / rescue results are particu - larly important , as in the case of overexpression , WT - cofilin still maintains all of the same binding partners and localization . If CALI of wild - type cofilin did indeed cause nonspecific collateral dam - age to the tightly packed environment of the lamellipodia , it should have been evident in both the overexpression and knock - down / rescue experiments . In this sense , overexpression of WT - cofilin - KR becomes an excellent control for CALI specificity in the lamellipodia . The identification that in some instances , CALI of cofilin S3A was able to mimic loss of cofilin in cofilin - KD cells was also important , as this may be considered for future experiments in which it is not possible to use a knockdown / rescue approach . Some CALI experi - ments required knockdown / rescue ( Vitriol et al . , 2007 ) , whereas FIGURE 6 : Knockdown of endogenous cofilin1 allows for effects in the lamellipodia after CALI of wild - type cofilin .

Volume 24 July 15 , 2013 Instant cofilin loss increases F - actin | 2245 charge - coupled device ( EMCCD ) camera ( Photometrics , Tucson , AZ ) using a 60 × / 1 . 49 numerical aperture ( NA ) Apochromat ( Apo ) total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) oil immersion objective . Cells were mounted in a custom live - cell chamber and maintained at 37°C with a heated stage adapter ( Warner , Hamden , CT ) . CALI experiments were performed on a Nikon A1R fully auto - mated laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with an auto - mated z - drive with Perfect Focus , multiple laser lines with acousto - optic tunable filter control , motorized x - y stage , a second resonance scanner for high - speed imaging and photoactivation , an attached cage incubator with CO 2 and temperature control , and multiple photomultiplier tube detectors . Cells were mounted in a custom live - cell chamber . All experiments were performed using a 60 × / 1 . 49 NA Apo TIRF oil immersion objective . To ensure evenness of expression , all cells chosen for CALI experiments had mean KR fluorescence values within 20 % of each other . CALI was performed by continuously irradiating a region con - taining the entire cell with the 561 - nm laser line for 2 min with the laser power at 100 % ( 9 mW at the microscope objective ) and a 78 - μs pixel dwell time . Photoactivation of PA - GFP was performed with the 405 - nm laser line ( laser power 100 % , 2 . 2 - μs pixel dwell time ) by irradiating a circular region with a 10 - μm diameter with a single 100 - ms bleaching iteration . Two different regions were cho - sen for each cell to measure actin monomer mobility both before and after CALI . FRAP of EGFP and KR was performed by irradiating a 5 - μm diameter with a single 1 - s bleaching iteration with either the 405 / 488 or the 405 / 488 / 561 - nm laser lines , respectively ( laser power 100 % , 2 . 2 - μs pixel dwell time ) . For all experiments , GFP or EGFP fluorescence was monitored with the 488 - nm laser line . Irradiation of cells with the 561 - nm laser line for CALI had no photobleaching effect on GFP or EGFP fluorescence . Superresolution imaging was performed on a Nikon N - SIM mi - croscope equipped with an automated piezo z - drive with Perfect Focus , a motorized x - y stage , and an iXon3 897 EMCCD camera ( Andor , Belfast , United Kingdom ) . Images were acquired in 3D - SIM mode using a 100 × / 1 . 49 NA Apo TIRF objective . Cells were mounted in a custom live - cell chamber and maintained at 30°C . Image analysis All microscope image sets were obtained using Nikon Elements and then analyzed with ImageJ software ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) . To determine colocalization between cofilin - KR constructs and Lifeact - EGFP , background - subtracted images were exported into ImageJ , where they were transformed into RGB . tif files and analyzed using the Edge Ratio macro as described ( Cai et al . , 2008 ; available at www . unc . edu / ∼ cail / programming . html ) . Edge intensity values were normalized to the peak fluorescence value for each curve . To determine actin monomer mobility rates , fluorescence inten - sities from the photoactivated region and a background region from the opposite side of the cell were exported into Excel software ( Microsoft , Redmond , WA ) . Intracellular background fluorescence intensity values were subtracted from the photoactivated intensity values to account for general changes in cellular fluorescence . In - tensity values were normalized to the time point immediately after photoactivation . Double - exponential curve fitting was performed on the fluorescence decay curves with a free online curve - fitting ap - plication ( http : / / ZunZun . com / ) so that τ 1 / 2 could be obtained . To determine retrograde flow rates , PA - GFP - actin image sets were divided into pre - and post - CALI . Image sets were background subtracted , and then kymographs were drawn at the edge of cells where PA - GFP - actin incorporation into the lamellipodia was clearly Lawrenceville , GA ) and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) . Cells were imaged in DMEM / F12 minus phenol red supplemented with 15 mM 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - 1 - piperazineethane - sulfonic acid ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . CAD cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 ( Roche , Indianapolis , IN ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . For imaging experiments , cells were plated on coverslips coated with 20 μg / ml laminin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . For shRNAi knockdown of cofilin , cells were infected with lentivi - ral particles ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) that ex - pressed both an shRNAi hairpin against mouse cofilin1 and a gene for puromycin resistance . Infection was done in the presence of 5 μg / ml Polybrene ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) . At 48 h after infec - tion , cells were selected with 10 μg / ml puromycin ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) . This concentration was chosen because it killed 100 % of uninfected cells within 24 h . After selection , cells were con - tinuously cultured in media containing 10 μg / ml puromycin , except during imaging experiments . Efficacy of knockdown monitored by Western blot . A rabbit polyclonal antibody against cofilin ( ab42824 ; Abcam , Cambridge , MA ) was used for Western blotting . Microscopy Imaging for colocalization between cofilin - KR constructs and Life - act - EGFP was performed on an Eclipse Ti inverted microscope ( Nikon , Melville , NY ) equipped with a QuantEM electron - multiplying FIGURE 7 : Live - cell superresolution imaging of actin demonstrates an increase in lamellipodial F - actin after CALI of cofilin .

Scale bars , 5 μm . 2246 | E . A . Vitriol et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell visible . Kymographs were drawn in as many regions of the cell as possible . Retrograde flow was measured by drawing a diagonal line that traced the rearward flow of incorporated PA - GFP - actin , repre - senting the distance the actin traveled over time . To determine the changes in intensity and distribution of actin and actin regulatory proteins after CALI , background - subtracted im - age sets were exported into Matlab software ( MathWorks , Natick , MA ) and analyzed using a custom script that automatically detects the cell edge based on a user - input threshold value and then divides the cells into concentric distance bins of user - defined width . For all experiments a distance bin value of 0 . 4 μm was used . Each CALI movie contained 40 frames before irradiation and 60 frames after irradiation . All movies were manually checked to ensure that edge detection was accurate for the duration of the time lapse . In - tensity values from each distance bin from every frame of all movies from each data set were averaged and then exported into Excel for analysis . Edge measurement curves were normalized to the first value of the curve . For edge measurement experiments only cells that exhibited a lamellipodia on at least 80 % of their periphery for the entire duration of the movie were used . A second method was used in which kymographs were drawn in lamellipodia regions and then analyzed with a custom Matlab script that automatically de - tected the edge of the cell with user - defined threshold intensity and then reported intensity values in user - defined distance bins ( 0 . 4 μm was used ) . This method allowed us to include a greater number of cells and exclude regions where there was not a lamellipodium for the entire duration of the movie . Intensity values from each time point of every kymograph were exported into Excel and then nor - malized as described . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank James E .
