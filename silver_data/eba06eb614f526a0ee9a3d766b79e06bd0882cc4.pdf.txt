S1 Supplemental material Materials . 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - 1 - piperazineethanesulfonic acid ( HEPES ) and polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) were from SIGMA - ALDRICH® ( St . Louis , MO ) ; sodium chloride ( NaCl ) was from Fisher Scientific ( Fair Lawn , NJ ) ; tris ( 2 - carboxyethyl ) phosphine ( TCEP ) , Coomassie plus ( Bradford ) protein assay reagent , and bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) standards were from Pierce / Thermo Fisher Scientific ( Rockford , IL ) ; the dyes Pacific Blue™ ( PB ) C5 - maleimide , Alexa Fluor® 488 ( AF - 488 ) C5 - maleimide , and Texas Red 1 , 2 - Dihexadecanoyl - sn - Glycero - 3 - Phosphoethanolamine , Triethylammonium Salt ( Texas Red DHPE ) were from Invitrogen / Life Technologies ( Carlsbad , CA ) ; casein was obtained from Fisher Scientific ( Rochester , NY ) ; urea was from Fisher BioReagents ( Pittsburgh , PA ) . 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DOPC ) , 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phospho - L - serine ( DOPS ) , 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine ( DOPE ) and L - α - phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ) were from Avanti Polar Lipids ( Alabaster , AL ) . Protein Preparation . A plasmid encoding rat endophilin A1 ( obtained from P . De Camilli , Yale ) was used to generate endo _ N - BAR , endo _ dH0 and endo _ dSH3 mutants . All of these , including the full length protein , contained a single cysteine introduced at position 241 , for details see ref . ( 1 ) . Proteins were purified as described ( 1 ) . Briefly , BAR domains were affinity - purified ( via cleavable GST ) , then subjected to ion exchange and size exclusion chromatography , and stored after flash - freezing . Before measurements , supernatant portions from ultracentrifugation of thawed samples were selected and solution concentrations determined as described ( 1 ) . Note that concentrations considered below refer to endo _ N - BAR subunits ( i . e . monomers rather than dimers ) . All proteins were labeled with cysteine - reactive ( maleimide - ) dyes as described , and unreacted dye was removed by HiTrap Desalting columns ( GE ) ( 1 ) . Dual - labeled protein was prepared by incubating proteins with a dye mixture ( PB / AF488 mole fraction = 0 . 5 ) . The labeling efficiency for both fluorophores was determined through absorption measurements . AF 488’s concentration can be determined from its absorbance peak value since PB’s contribution to the AF488 absorbance peak is negligible . PB’s concentration could be determined after S2 subtracting the contribution of AF488 to PB’s absorbance peak . Dye concentrations thus determined , together with measured protein concentrations yield the labeling ratios . Casein Passivation . The loss of protein due to surface adsorption during sample preparation and measurements affects the accuracy of our measurements , particularly at low protein concentrations . Therefore , several methods ( including passivation through incubation with casein , BSA , and PEG , respectively ) were evaluated for passivation of cuvettes , tips and tubes used in our measurements . From this comparison ( data not shown ) , we found that passivation with casein was the most efficient method of preventing protein loss , to less than 3 % in 1 . 5 hours . Thus , casein passivation was used for all of our measurements as follows . Dried casein was dissolved in buffer solution at 5 mg / ml , and the solution was filtered before use . The casein solution was applied to 1 . 5 ml tubes , pipette tips , and quartz cuvettes , followed by incubation for 1 hour at room temperature . The casein solution was then removed and the tubes , tips and cuvettes were rinsed two times with buffer solution . To demonstrate the effectiveness of this passivation procedure , excitation scans of endo _ N - BAR _ C241 - AF - 488 ( monitoring emission at 519 nm ) were acquired as a function of target total subunit concentration without casein passivation ( Fig . S1A ) and with casein passivation ( Fig . S1B ) . Significant deviation from a linear trend for low concentrations in Fig . S1A indicates protein loss most likely due to surface adsorption during sample preparation and measurements . The comparison to Fig . S1B shows that casein passivation effectively reduces this protein loss . S3 Figure S1 . Casein passivation can effectively reduce loss of endo _ N - BAR during incubation and measurements . A , Fluorescence emission as a function of total subunit concentration obtained without casein passivation . Endo _ N - BAR _ C241 - AF - 488 was excited at 495 nm , and emission was measured at 519 nm . B , Same conditions as those in ( A ) , except for casein passivation being applied . Fluorimetry Measurements . Both kinetic and equilibrium fluorimetry measurements were performed with a Cary Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer with a Peltier - controlled temperature block . In the Fӧrster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) measurements , Endo _ N - BAR _ C241 - PB served as donor and Endo _ N - BAR _ C241 - AF - 488 as acceptor . The ratio of donor / acceptor was chosen as 0 . 5 to promote FRET ( 1 ) . The peak values of the emission spectra ( 455 nm for PB and 519 nm for AF - 488 ) and the peak value of the excitation spectrum of AF - 488 ( 495 nm ) were chosen for analysis . Proteins were incubated in 150 mM NaCl , 20 mM HEPES , 1 mM TCEP , pH 7 . 4 buffer solution . Kinetic Measurements . Kinetic measurements determined the dissociation rate constant , (cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:4) , for endo _ N - BAR dimerization . Both donor and acceptor samples were diluted separately with buffer such that the final total subunit concentration was 2 µM in each . Then two samples were pre - incubated at the temperature of interest until they had fully reached monomer / dimer equilibrium , as determined by FRET studies . The following incubation times and incubation temperatures were chosen : 40 hours for 22 ºC , 9 hours at 27 ºC , 3 hours at 30 ºC , 1 hour at 32 ºC , 18 minutes at 35 ºC , and 10 minutes at 37 ºC . The equilibrated endo _ N - BAR samples were combined ( total endo _ N - BAR subunit concentration remained 2 µM after combination , donor to acceptor ratio was adjusted to 0 . 5 ) , and mixed by pipetting up and down . An excitation scan was taken immediately after mixing , followed by sequential emission scans to monitor FRET . The duration of the time series was the same as the pre - incubation period . Afterwards , a second excitation scan was taken to ensure that the endo _ N - BAR concentration remained constant throughout the experiment . As detailed below , at higher temperatures , the kinetics of subunit exchange is much faster than at lower temperature points . Thus , at high temperatures significant monomer exchange might occur already during the first excitation scan . To avoid this problem for the highest temperatures considered , the S4 sequential emission scans were taken immediately after mixing the two differently labeled protein samples at 35 ºC and 37 ºC . Via excitation scans using a second sample in a separate cuvette , we ensured absence of significant protein loss during measurements at 35 ºC and 37 ºC . From the comparison of the peak of the excitation spectrum at 495 nm preceding and following the time series ( a representative example is shown in Fig . S2A ) , we ensured that protein concentration change was < 5 % for all temperature trials . We choose measurements at the temperature of 37 ºC to demonstrate the protocol for data analysis . In the analysis , the average fluorescence intensity over a wavelength range of 8 nm in the neighborhood of the peak wavelength was used . The time dependence of donor quenching at 455 nm ( see arrow in Fig . S2B ) is plotted in Fig . S2C . FRET efficiency was calculated according to , (cid:5) = 1 − (cid:9) (cid:10)(cid:11) (cid:9) (cid:10) , ( S1 ) where (cid:12) (cid:13) is the peak initial donor fluorescence and (cid:12) (cid:13)(cid:14) is the donor fluorescence ( in the presence of the acceptor ) at the time point of interest . The calculated FRET efficiency is graphed in Fig . S2D . Assuming a two - step process for endo _ N - BAR association / dissociation , it can be shown that monomer exchange kinetics ( and thus the time dependence of the FRET signal ) depend only on (cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:4) ( 1 - 3 ) , according to : (cid:5) = (cid:5) (cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:4) ( 1 − (cid:18) (cid:19)(cid:20)∗(cid:22) (cid:23)(cid:24)(cid:24) ) , ( S2 ) where (cid:5) (cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:4) is the FRET efficiency limit ( FRET efficiency at t = ∞ ) . Fitting Eq . S2 to the FRET efficiency values ( Fig . S2D ) yields (cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:4) = 7 . 63×10 - 3 (cid:26) (cid:19)(cid:27) and (cid:5) (cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:4) = 41 . 6 % for this measurement at 37ºC . For the measurements just described , endo _ N - BAR domains were labeled with two fluorophores ( PB and AF - 488 ) . It is important to evaluate the potential influence of the fluorescent labels on the kinetics of endo _ N - BAR dimerization / dissociation . We therefore asked the question if the presence of labels on S5 endo _ N - BAR alter the kinetics of protein dimerization / dissociation . In the absence of such an effect , the overall equilibrium between dimers and monomers will not be perturbed through labeling ( 3 ) . To answer this question , a kinetic measurement at 37 ºC was carried out to monitor the monomer exchange kinetics of unlabeled and labeled endo _ N - BAR . For this purpose , the following solutions were separately equilibrated at 37 ºC : a 2 µM solution of dual - labeled endo _ N - BAR ( labeled both with PB and AF488 at a measured ratio of D / A = 0 . 44 ) and a second solution of unlabeled endo _ N - BAR ( 2 µM ) . After monomer / dimer equilibrium was established at this temperature , the two solutions were quickly combined and sequential emission scans were obtained . The initial scan showed maximal FRET . With increasing time , the FRET efficiency decreased , showing an increase in the donor emission at the emission maximum of the donor ( (cid:28) (cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:13) = 455 nm ) ( Fig . S2E ) , which was termed donor dequenching here . The extent of donor dequenching , (cid:5) (cid:31) , shown in Fig . S2F , was fitted with Eq . S2 ( with (cid:5) exchanged by (cid:5) (cid:31) ) , yielding (cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:4) = 6 . 15×10 - 3 (cid:26) (cid:19)(cid:27) ( i . e . comparable to the value found for the donor quenching experiment ) , and (cid:5) (cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:4)(cid:31) = 17 . 9 % ( i . e . close to half of (cid:5) (cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:4) 41 . 6 % determined in the donor quenching experiments , as expected ) . Kinetic measurements of endo _ N - BAR dissociation in urea solution were carried out at 27 ºC . endo _ N - BAR _ C241 - PB and endo _ N - BAR _ C241 - AF - 488 were equilibrated separately in 0 M , 0 . 25 M , 0 . 5 M , 0 . 75 M , and 1 M urea buffer solution , respectively , and then mixed . A sequential emission scan ( as shown in materials and methods , kinetic measurements ) was taken immediately after mixing , to assess the FRET signal . The resulting trends of FRET efficiency with respect to time was fit with a two parameter model to obtain (cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:4) . Kinetic measurements of endo _ FL dissociation in urea solution were carried out at 37 ºC . Endo _ FL _ C241 - PB and endo _ FL _ C241 - AF - 488 were equilibrated separately in 0 . 75 M , 1 M , 1 . 25M urea buffer solution , respectively , and then mixed . A sequential emission scan was taken immediately after mixing , to S6 assess the FRET signal . The resulting trends of FRET efficiency with respect to time was fit with a two parameter model to obtain (cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:4) . Figure S2 .

F , Fluorescence intensity from ( E ) at the wavelength indicated by the dashed arrow allows calculation of the dequenching extent , (cid:5) (cid:31) relative to the initial intensity .

The goal of equilibrium FRET measurements was to determine the dissociation constant , (cid:13) , of ENBAR . As for kinetic measurements , casein passivation was used . In order to further reduce experimental errors resulting from pipetting and adsorption , we determined donor and acceptor content of mixed samples from fluorescence measurements . The procedure to quantify sensitized emission in the mixed sample and to relate it to endo _ N - BAR dimerization affinity is related to the procedure described in Refs ( 4 , 5 ) . Fig . S3A and S3B shows the emission and excitation scans , respectively , of a mixed sample FRET pair , a donor - only sample and an acceptor - only sample ( 5 ) . The concentrations of the donor and acceptor in the respective standard solutions were identical to the values in the mixed sample . Fig . S3A indicates that donor - only emission ( blue line ) is maximal at (cid:28) (cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:13) , while the acceptor - only emission ( red line ) at (cid:28) (cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:13) is negligible . The emission at (cid:28) (cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:13) , therefore , arises entirely from the donor . Excitation scans ( Fig . S3B ) reveal that the excitation of the acceptor - only sample ( green line ) is maximal at (cid:28) (cid:29) ! (cid:14) , which is an excitation wavelength leading to negligible donor excitation ( Fig . S3B , blue line ) . This means that measured emission at (cid:28) (cid:29) ! (cid:14) , upon direct excitation of the acceptor , is due to the acceptor only . Additionally , note that the emission spectrum of the mixed sample ( Fig . S3A , green line ) has two peaks . As shown above , the fluorescence at (cid:28) (cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:13) of a donor / acceptor mixture arises from donor fluorescence only . However , the fluorescence intensity (cid:12) (cid:29)(cid:30) ( (cid:28) (cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:14) ) of a mixed sample has three sources : a direct donor contribution , (cid:12) (cid:13)(cid:14) ( (cid:28) (cid:29)(cid:30) (cid:14) ) ; a direct acceptor contribution , (cid:12) (cid:14) ( (cid:28) (cid:29)(cid:30) (cid:14) ) ; and the sensitized emission of the acceptor , (cid:12) " (cid:29)(cid:16) ( (cid:28) (cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:14) ) . These relationships are shown below : S8 (cid:12) (cid:29)(cid:30) ( (cid:28) (cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:14) ) = (cid:12) (cid:14)(cid:13) ( (cid:28) (cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:14) ) + (cid:12) (cid:13)(cid:14) ( (cid:28) (cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:14) ) , ( S3 ) (cid:12) (cid:14)(cid:13) ( (cid:28) (cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:14) ) = (cid:12) (cid:14) ( (cid:28) (cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:14) ) + (cid:12) " (cid:29)(cid:16) ( (cid:28) (cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:14) ) . ( S4 ) Here , (cid:12) (cid:14)(cid:13) ( (cid:28) (cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:14) ) is the total acceptor emission at (cid:28) (cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:14) ( in the presence of the donor ) . The observations above indicate that emission scans of the donor - only sample and excitation scans of the acceptor - only sample can be used to calculate the direct contribution of donor and acceptor in emission spectra of mixed samples , and , further , to obtain the amount of FRET for each sample ( 5 ) . To perform equilibrium measurements , a donor - only standard and an acceptor - only standard were prepared as well as ten mixed samples with varying concentrations ( 4 ) . To keep the acceptor fraction constant across individual concentration points , the most concentrated sample of the series with mixed donor and acceptor was prepared and then diluted to the additional nine desired concentrations . To establish monomer - dimer equilibrium , the samples were incubated at specific temperatures for equilibration times indicated by kinetic measurements . For each sample , two scans were obtained : an excitation scan from 450 nm to 508 nm with an emission wavelength at 519 nm , and an emission scan from 420 nm to 580 nm with an excitation wavelength 400 nm . For all excitation and emission spectra , any buffer contribution was subtracted from all sample spectra . Fig . S3C - F shows the data processing protocol for equilibrium measurements in detail ( 5 ) . Firstly , as shown in Fig . S3C , the comparison of the acceptor standard excitation spectrum , (cid:12) (cid:14) , (cid:29) ! % , and the mixed sample excitation spectrum , (cid:12) (cid:29) ! , ( both at the wavelength (cid:28) (cid:29) ! (cid:14) of maximal acceptor excitation ) yields the ratio , (cid:9) & ' ( ( & ' (cid:11) ) (cid:9) (cid:11) , & ' ) ( ( & ' (cid:11) ) = * (cid:14) . ( S5 ) From this ratio , the direct acceptor contribution to the emission spectrum of a mixed sample can be calculated as follows ( Fig . S3D ) : S9 (cid:12) (cid:14) , (cid:29)(cid:30) % ∗ * (cid:14) = (cid:12) (cid:14) . ( S6 ) Here , (cid:12) (cid:14) , (cid:29)(cid:30) % and (cid:12) (cid:14) are emission spectra of the acceptor standard , and the calculated emission due to direct excitation of acceptor in the mixed sample , respectively . As a result , the emission spectrum , (cid:12) (cid:14) , from direct acceptor excitation at (cid:28) (cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:14) , can be subtracted from the emission spectrum of the mixed sample . Secondly , to subtract the donor emission from the spectrum of the mixed sample , a comparison of donor standard emission spectrum , (cid:12) (cid:13) , (cid:29)(cid:30) % , and mixed sample emission spectrum , (cid:12) (cid:29)(cid:30) , yields the ratio ( Fig . S3E ) , (cid:9) & , ( ( & , (cid:10) ) (cid:9) (cid:10) , & , ) ( ( & , (cid:10) ) = * (cid:13) . ( S7 ) As a result , the contribution of donor emission in the spectrum of the mixed sample can be calculated ( Fig . S3F ) : (cid:12) (cid:13) , (cid:29)(cid:30) % ∗ * (cid:13) = (cid:12) (cid:13)(cid:14) . ( S8 ) Accordingly , both the contributions from acceptor emission through direct excitation , (cid:12) (cid:14) , and donor emission , (cid:12) (cid:13)(cid:14) , can be accounted for . According to Eqs . ( S3 - 4 ) , (cid:12) " (cid:29)(cid:16) ( (cid:28) (cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:14) ) ( Fig . S3F ) can be calculated by subtraction of (cid:12) (cid:14) ( (cid:28) (cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:14) ) and (cid:12) (cid:13)(cid:14) ( (cid:28) (cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:14) ) from (cid:12) (cid:29)(cid:30) ( (cid:28) (cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:14) ) , to allow calculation of (cid:9) - & . / ( & , (cid:11) 0 (cid:9) (cid:11) / ( & , (cid:11) 0 for each sample . We note that under conditions where the acceptor fraction ( ratio of acceptor - labeled proteins relative to total protein concentration ) is constant , this ratio is directly proportional to the FRET efficiency . We monitor (cid:9) - & . / ( & , (cid:11) 0 (cid:9) (cid:11) / ( & , (cid:11) 0 with respect to varied total protein concentrations 1 2 and fit the results with the following equation ( 4 ) , (cid:9) - & . / ( & , (cid:11) 0 (cid:9) (cid:11) / ( & , (cid:11) 0 = 3 45 6 78 (cid:10) (cid:19) 98 (cid:10) : 7 ; 5 6 8 (cid:10) 45 6 , ( S9 ) S10 which yields the dissociation constant , K D , and the value of A ( which is the (cid:9) - & . / ( & , (cid:11) 0 (cid:9) (cid:11) / ( & , (cid:11) 0 value for an infinitely large 1 2 ) .

A , Emission scans ( excitation at 400 nm ) reveal that acceptor emission at (cid:28) (cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:13) is negligible .

C , Comparison of the excitation spectra of sample , (cid:12) (cid:29) ! , S11 and acceptor standard (cid:12) (cid:14) , (cid:29) ! % , yields a ratio , * (cid:14) , by equation ( S5 ) . D , Calculation of the direct acceptor contribution , (cid:12) (cid:14) , via equation ( S6 ) .

E , Calculation of the direct donor contribution , (cid:12) (cid:13)(cid:14) , via equation ( S8 ) determines the sensitized emission , (cid:12) " (cid:29)(cid:16) ( (cid:28) (cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:14) ) . Association Rate Constant of endo _ N - BAR The monomer association rate constant of Endo _ N - BAR is calculated from the ratio of dissociation rate constant , (cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:4) , and dissociation constant , K D . Figure S4 . The natural logarithm of the association rate constant depends linearly on the reciprocal temperature . Comparison of binding capacity of endophilin constructs To compare the membrane binding capacity among endophilin constructs , we have measured the membrane binding fluorescence intensity of different endophilin truncation constructs by adding the same concentration of endo _ FL , endo _ N - BAR , endo _ dSH3 and endo _ dH0 into GUV dispersions with identical lipid concentrations ( composition 24 . 5 % DOPC + 35 % DOPS + 30 % DOPE + 10 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , + 0 . 5 % TexasRed - DHPE ) . Figure S5 , shows that no significant difference in membrane binding capacity was observed for endo _ N - BAR and endo _ dSH3 . However , endo _ FL showed significantly lower membrane S12 binding capacity compared endo _ N - BAR ( the fluorescence intensity of endo _ FL is ~ 35 % of that of endo _ N - BAR ) . This observation is consistent with a hypothesized auto - inhibition for full - length endophilin . Figure S5 also shows that the membrane binding capacity of endo _ dH0 is substantially smaller than that of endo _ FL . The significantly weaker binding capacity in the absence of the H0 helix is consistent with literature findings since the H0 helix is known to insert into the membrane during membrane association and to significantly contribute to the membrane binding capacity of endophilin by mediating its oligomerization on the membrane ( 6 , 7 ) . Figure S5 . The protein fluorescence intensity of endo _ FL , endo _ N - BAR , endo _ dSH3 , and endo _ dH0 , bound to GUV membranes . All endophilin constructs were labeled with Alexa fluor 488 . GUVs were prepared with the composition of 24 . 5 % DOPC , 35 % DOPS , 30 % DOPE , 10 % DOPS and 0 . 5 % Texas Red - DHPE . The protein concentrations for different constructs were kept to be identical at 100 nM , and the lipid concentration was kept at 18 . 5 µ M for all trials . The numbers of GUVs used to obtain these results was 26 , 22 , 18 and 17 , respectively . Reference 1 . Capraro , B . R . , Shi , Z . , Wu , T . T . , Chen , Z . M . , Dunn , J .
