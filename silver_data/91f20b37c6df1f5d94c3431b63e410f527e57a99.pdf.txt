We unveil the repertoire of 14 cellular behaviours underlying statoacoustic morphogenesis and its dependence on 15 relevant pioneer neurons . 16 17 18 Abstract 19 20 Cranial ganglia are aggregates of sensory neurons that mediate distinct types of sensation . 21 It is little understood how individual neurons coalesce , distribute and shape the ganglion . 22 The statoacoustic ganglion ( SAG ) displays several lobes spatially arranged to properly 23 connect with hair cells of the inner ear . To investigate the cellular behaviors involved in 24 the 3D organization of the SAG , we use high resolution confocal imaging of single cell 25 labeled zebrafish neuroblasts ( NB ) , photoconversion , photoablation and genetic 26 perturbations . We find that otic NB delaminate out of the otic epithelium in an EMT - like 27 manner , rearranging apical polarity and primary cilia proteins . We also show that , once 28 delaminated , NB migrate directionally and actively , requiring RhoGTPases . 29 Interestingly , cell tracking of individual delaminated NB reveals that NB migrate and 30 coalesce around a small population of pioneer SAG neurons . These pioneer SAG neurons 31 are not from otic placode origin and populate the coalescence region before otic 32 neurogenesis begins . Upon ablation of these cells , migratory pathways of delaminated 33 NB are disrupted and , consequently , SAG shape is affected . Altogether , this work shows 34 for the first time the role of pioneer SAG neurons in orchestrating SAG development . 35 2 36 37 Introduction 38 39 The inner ear is responsible for the senses of hearing and balance and is organized in two 40 main structures , the epithelial labyrinth containing the hair cells and the statoacoustic 41 ganglion ( SAG ) , the inner ear cranial sensory ganglion . Through development , cranial 42 sensory ganglia undergo cellular rearrangements in a process of morphogenesis to acquire 43 its final functional shape . The SAG generates a particular architecture with three distinct 44 lobes ; two anterior lobes elongated dorsoventrally and a posterior lobe elongated 45 anteroposteriorly that establish topographic projections with the sensory patches of the 46 inner ear ( Taberner et al . , 2018 ) . Thus , for a correct circuitry between hair cells and otic 47 neurons , SAG morphogenesis must be tightly coordinated in time and space with otic 48 tissue development . 49 Several studies have addressed the morphogenetic mechanisms underlying the 3D 50 sculpturing of the inner ear labyrinth . In particular , the zebrafish has been an excellent 51 model to live - image inner ear morphogenesis . By light sheet microscopy , it has been 52 shown that zebrafish semicircular canal formation depends on ECM expansion and 53 filopodia ( Jones et al . , 2022 ) . On the other hand , lumen expansion requires anisotropic 54 epithelial thinning and mechanical pulling of apical membranes and endolymphatic duct 55 growth depends on lamellar projections ( Hoijman et al . , 2015 ; Swinburne et al . , 2018 ) . 56 In contrast , live imaging of SAG neurons is a challenging task because neurons position 57 behind the otic vesicle and rapidly compact into a ganglion . For that reason , SAG neurons 58 have mainly been treated as a ganglionic unit and imaging and analysis of individual 59 neuronal dynamics during SAG development has poorly been addressed . 60 The inner ear primordium , the otic placode , consists of an oval epithelium with an internal 61 cavity or lumen . Otic progenitors display interkinetic nuclear migration and its apical 62 membrane is oriented to the lumen and the basal membrane lines with the basal lamina 63 ( Alvarez et al . , 1989 ) . At the anteroventral quadrant of the otic vesicle the neurogenic 64 domain emerges with the competence to specify neuronal precursors ( Abelló et al . , 2010 ; 65 Hoijman et al . , 2017 ) . Neurogenesis initiates anteroventrally but progressively extends to 66 posteromedial positions as observed by the temporal pattern of expression of neurogenin1 67 ( neurog1 ) in zebrafish , mouse and chick ( Abelló et al . , 2007 ; Bok et al . , 2007 , 2011 ; 68 Radosevic et al . , 2011 ) . Later , Neurog1 + cells transit into Neurod + cells and begin their 69 3 delamination out of the otic epithelium ( Ma et al . , 1998 ; Sommer et al . , 1996 ) . In chick 70 and zebrafish , it has been shown that the most anterolateral portion of the neurogenic 71 domain generates vestibular neurons , whereas the posteromedial region gives rise to 72 auditory neurons ( Bell et al . , 2008 ; Dyballa et al . , 2017 ) . Whether otic NB delamination 73 follows an EMT program has been under debate . Some authors have suggested that core - 74 EMT transcription factors and RhoGTPases ( specially RhoB ) are not used in this process 75 of sensory neuron delamination in cranial placodes ( Graham et al . , 2007 ) . Additionally , 76 migratory capacity of cranial placode NB seems diminished compared to neural crest 77 ( Schlosser , 2008 ) . Other evidences suggest the contrary , since snail1b , cadherin6 and 78 Sox9 / 10 family genes are expressed in delaminating Neurod + otic NB and / or otic domains 79 in zebrafish ( Chiang et al . , 2001 ; Dutton et al . , 2009 ; Piloto & Schilling , 2010 ; Thisse et 80 al . , 1995 ) . 81 In the developing central nervous system , sparse single cell labelling of membranes , 82 nuclei and / or specific cellular components has revealed novel information on cell shape 83 changes and behaviours during cell delamination , division or migration ( Hadjivasiliou et 84 al . , 2019 ; Kasioulis et al . , 2022 ; Moore et al . , 2013 ) . Radial glial cell migration in the 85 cortical plate is a long - known mechanism by which newborn neurons use progenitor cell 86 projections to properly migrate at later stages ( Rakic , 1971a , 1971b ; Shoukimas & Hinds , 87 1978 ) . Specially studied in invertebrates is the modulation of neuronal dynamics during 88 development by pioneer cells . These pioneer cells are defined as early born cells that have 89 a scaffolding capacity to organize the tissue and preform the final configuration ( Aigouy 90 et al . , 2008 ; Karkali et al . , 2023 ; Wanner & Prince , 2013 ; Whitlock & Westerfield , 1998 ) . 91 Thus , a central question is how otic ganglion NB delaminate , migrate and coalesce 92 ( Dyballa et al . , 2017 ; Hoijman et al . , 2017 ) and whether other cells participate in SAG 93 formation . 94 Here , we have addressed SAG morphogenesis by combining single cell labeling , 95 photoconversion , photoablation and genetic perturbations . Our data suggest that indeed 96 NB delamination is an EMT event . We could track individual NB during their migration 97 before coalescence and revealed that is an active mechanism . We also find that otic NB 98 migration depends on RhoGTPases . Interestingly , NB migrate and coalesce in a precise 99 region populated by SAG pioneer neurons that arrived before neurogenic delamination in 100 the otic placode begins . These pioneer SAG neurons recruit otic NB and are required for 101 the organization of the SAG shape and size . In overall , the study provides novel data on 102 4 how the SAG acquires its 3D organization and the underlying complex cellular 103 behaviours of NB responsible for SAG development . 104 105 106 Results 107 108 Live imaging of otic neuroblasts during delamination reveal complex and dynamic 109 cellular behaviors 110 Zebrafish NB delaminate out from the neurogenic domain depicted in red in an otic 111 vesicle of 20 hpf ( Fig . 1A ) and generate the trilobular SAG behind the otic vesicle as 112 visualized with the transgenic line Tg ( neurod : eGFP ) ( Fig . 1A , green and Fig . 1B , right 113 panel ) . In the ventral neurogenic domain , predelaminating NB remodel and acquire a 114 different shape than cells in the non - neurogenic domain , which are more columnar 115 ( compare green with purple pseudocolored cells Fig . 1B ) . 116 To better characterize the cell shape changes during delamination in single NB , we 117 fluorescently labelled the membranes in single and scattered NB by injecting 118 lynTdTomato mRNA into one of the cells at 32 - 64 cell stage embryos . High 119 spatiotemporal resolution in vivo imaging from 24 to 36hpf , the time window of highly 120 active NB delamination , shows how a delaminating NB progressively acquires a 121 triangular shape and concentrates the cytoplasm basally ( Fig . 1C and E ) . During this cell 122 shape rearrangement , the apical domain becomes narrower in a zipper - like process , to 123 finally become a thin membranous filament ( arrowheads in Fig . 1C ) . In the neural tube , 124 it has been shown that the differentiating neurons detach from the apical membrane by a 125 process of apical abscission , in which the cell is apically constricted and detached from 126 the luminal membrane ( Das & Storey , 2014 ) . Individual labelling of otic NB allow us 127 to also observe that when the basal cell body is mostly outside the epithelium , the 128 attachment to the apical membrane is broken and the delaminating NB loses its apical 129 contact , leaving some membrane debris behind ( Fig . 1C white arrows , Fig . 1E , Movie 1 ) . 130 Using in vivo resonant scanning for higher temporal resolution ( Fig . 1D ) shows how 131 predelaminating NB generate a high number of dynamic filopodia inside and outside the 132 neuroepithelium as well as blebs at the basal cellular domain lining the basal lamina ( Fig . 133 1D arrowheads from top to bottom rows , respectively . Movie 2 ) . The basal lamina is 134 disrupted at the neurogenic domain ( unpublished results from the laboratory and Alvarez 135 et al . , 1989 ) . 136 137 5 138 To ascertain whether apicobasal polarity is lost or rearranged during the delamination 139 process . we assessed the localization of the apical determinants during delamination . For 140 this , lynTdTomato mRNA was co - injected with the apical protein Pard3 mRNA at 32 - 64 141 cell stage . When analyzing Pard3 signal location in individual NB , it can be appreciated 142 that a small fraction of Pard3 signal is kept at the abscised membrane that is left at the 143 luminal area during the whole process ( Fig . 1E , inset in central panel ) , but another 144 fraction is detected regressing with the plasma membrane thinning edge ( Fig . 1E , white 145 arrowhead ) . In addition , accumulation of Pard3 is also transiently detected in the basal 146 cytoplasmatic domain in early delamination ( Fig . 1E , yellow arrow in central panel ) , 147 suggesting a possible change in polarity ( Movie1 and 3 ) . When labeling is less mosaic , it 148 can be observed several cells delaminating collectively ( Fig . 1F ) . Some NB delaminate 149 more dorsally ( red , yellow and blue dots ) and others more ventrally ( magenta dot , absent 150 in first frame ) . Delaminating NB produce dynamic filopodia ( Fig . 1F , white arrowheads ) 151 and dynamically relocate puncta of Pard3 ( Fig . 1F , white arrows ) . 152 153 Once NB are completely outside , they acquire a more mesenchymal and rounded shape . 154 In a group of already delaminated NB contacting each other ( Fig . 1G ) , a punctuated Pard3 155 pattern is initially observed at cell - cell contacts and is then redistributed as NB separate 156 ( Fig . 2C , blue and orange dots indicate cell bodies that separate through time ) . This 157 suggests that in spite of a mesenchymal phenotype , polarity is reorganized and could be 158 the driving force for NB dispersion ( Fig . 1G and Movie 4 ) . As observed in Fig . 1C and 159 Fig . 1E the delamination of NB spans for a period of 1 , 5 - 2 hours . 160 161 During the delamination of neural tube differentiating neurons , it has been shown that 162 aPKC and the primary cilia are retained in the ventricle membrane when the cell suffers 163 apical abscission ( Das & Storey , 2014 ) . In contrast , zebrafish retinal neuroblasts keep 164 the primary cilia at the apical front of the retracting cell or either dismantle it only shortly 165 before retraction during delamination ( Lepanto et al . , 2016 ) . To study the localization of 166 the primary cilia during otic NB delamination , we used the Tg ( actb2 : arl13B - GFP ) line . 167 In the non - neurogenic and neurogenic regions ( upper and lower dotted squares 168 respectively in Fig . 1H ) , it can already be appreciated how Arl13b staining is oriented 169 towards the lumen in the non - neurogenic region but absent inside the epithelium , while 170 present inside the neurogenic domain epithelium . This suggests that delaminating NB 171 6 carry the primary cilia with them when delaminating , while non - delaminating cells keep 172 Arl13b in the apical site ( Inset Fig . 1H’ and Fig . 1H’’ and Movie 5 ) . In a kymograph of 173 the area ( spatial section of these regions across time , white transverse lines in Fig . 1H’ - 174 H’’ ) , Arl13b is found crossing the spatial section of delaminating NB but not crossing in 175 non - delaminating region , again suggesting Arl13b locates inside the neuroepithelium 176 only in the delaminating region ( Fig . 1H’ and H’’ kymographs ) . 177 178 Injection of mRNA at 32 - 64 cell stage results in few embryos with individual cells 179 labelled . To increase the dataset of single NB labelled , we used what we have called 180 CRISPR Eraser . In these experiments , a RNAguide against GFP is injected in embryos 181 of the Tg ( neurod : eGFP ) reporter line that labels NB . Since Cas9 is highly efficient , most 182 cells will have its GFP gene disrupted by Cas9 and only few NB retain cytoplasmic eGFP 183 expression , either by escaping Cas9 targeting or because of efficient repair restoring 184 eGFP genomic sequence ( See Materials and Methods and Supplementary figure 1 ) . In 185 consequence , this creates an environment in which most of Neurod + cells of the 186 developing SAG are eGFP negative and the remaining eGFP + NB can be seen with high 187 contrast . 188 189 In CRISPR Eraser embryos , NB cell bodies change from the elongated and triangular 190 shape to a rounded cell body when exit the epithelium ( Fig . 2A , white arrowheads in 191 upper panel ) . Once delaminated , NB modify their roundness , extend filopodial 192 protrusions that later on translate into larger membrane deformations ( Fig . 2A , white 193 arrowheads middle panel , Fig . 2C and Movie 6 ) and elongate ( Fig . 2A , brackets in lower 194 panel ) . During the whole span of the imaging of selected NB , the roundness has been 195 quantified using FIJI and plotted in an example in Fig . 2B ( Figure Supplementary2 shows 196 more examples ) . At least three different phases of cell shape variation can be 197 distinguished : an initial phase corresponding to apical thinning and delamination , a 198 second phase of increased roundness and membrane protrusions and a final phase of 199 elongation , presumably to engage into migration . IMARIS 3D reconstruction of a 200 paradigmatic example depicts these three stages ( Fig . 2B ) 201 202 Individual labelling of NB and live imaging permits to highlight the remodeling events 203 during delamination and outside the otic epithelium . Delaminating NB suffer a process 204 of apical thinning and abscission but Pard3 and Arl13b components are not lost and 205 7 relocate in the delaminated cell , suggesting that can help establish a new polarity front in 206 NB . Moreover , NB extensively deform their membranes with large number of blebs , 207 filopodia and larger protrusions , suggesting that might contribute to generate mechanical 208 forces and / or establish cell communication events . 209 210 Active migration of delaminated SAG neuroblasts is RhoGTPases - dependent 211 Massive delamination of zebrafish otic NB in the anterolateral region takes place between 212 17 and 30 hpf . Large groups of cells delaminate and position anterior to the otic 213 epithelium ( Hoijman et al . , 2017 ) . Thus , displacement of NB within the SAG can be 214 driven mainly by new delaminating NB pushing on the previously delaminated cells . 215 However , the dynamical changes in cellular shape and apicobasal polarity , together with 216 the presence of filopodia observed in individual labelled NB , suggest that delaminated 217 NB might display an active and directed migratory behavior . 218 Most of the cellular deformations produced by cells to actively migrate involve the 219 activation of RhoGTPases . In particular , Rac1 RhoGTPase is implicated in directed 220 migration and lamellipodia formation , Cdc42 in acquisition of migratory capacity and 221 filopodia formation and Rho in stress fibers and rear contractility ( Nobes & Hall , 1995 ; 222 Reig et al . , 2014 ; Shoval & Kalcheim , 2012 ; Yamao et al . , 2015 ) . To investigate the role 223 of RhoGTPases in NB migration , we decided to manipulate this signaling pathway in NB . 224 To this aim , we generated a CRISPR knock - in Gal4 line in the endogenous locus of the 225 neurod gene which recapitulated the expression of the reporter transgenic line 226 Tg ( neurod : eGFP ) ( Supplementary figure 3 ) . We then overexpressed different dominant 227 negative ( DN ) and constantly active ( CA ) forms of RhoGTPases in the new 228 Tg ( neurod : Gal4 ) transgenic line . 229 230 We first overexpressed the dominant negative ( DN ) form of Rac1 by injecting at 1 - cell 231 stage embryos the UAS : DNRac1a - F2A - GFP Tol2 construct ( Hanovice et al . , 2016 ) . We 232 then tracked , over a period of 10 hours , control cells under CRISPR Eraser condition and 233 the Rac1 inhibited cells expressing GFP ( Fig . 3A versus Fig4 . 3A’ and Movie 7 ) . 234 Compared with control cells , DNRac1a cells showed a reduced migration distance 235 irrespectively of their initial position ( lateral , medial or posteroventral ; compare white 236 tracks from pseudocolored magenta cells in Fig . 3A versus 3A’ and D , ) . All tracks are 237 plotted in Fig . 3D using DiPER ( Gorelik & Gautreau , 2014 ) , as well as 4 individual ones 238 as examples ( n = 25 control cells and n = 30 DNRac1 cells , from 7 and 14 embryos , 239 8 respectively ) . Fig . 3E represents a 95 % confidence interval of 2D spatial dispersion of 240 NB considering the final position of every NB in control ( blue dots ) and DNRac1a 241 ( orange dots ) conditions after normalizing the tracks to origin ( Breau et al . , 2017 ; Gorelik 242 & Gautreau , 2014 ) . In summary , Fig . 3E shows the covered area ( ellipses ) or dispersion 243 of NB in control vs DNRac1a conditions after assuming they all depart from the same 244 point ( See 2D Dispersion analysis in Materials and Methods section ) . Non - overlapping 245 regions and different ellipse centroids ( black dots Fig . 3E ) reveal differences in the 246 dispersion of NB between conditions . Statistically significant representations of such 247 differences are the reduced distance in X axis and the reduced effective distance traveled 248 of DNRac1a NB versus control NB ( Fig . 3F , ticks in X represent 10µm increase ) . The 249 effective distance traveled by cells is the straight line from initial to final position . 250 251 Comparing quantified velocities across time ( Fig . 3G left graph and Supplementary figure 252 4 ) , DNRac1a - expressing NB are similar to control cells . However , migrated distance is 253 reduced in DNRac1a conditions ( Fig . 3E - F ) . This indicates that the directionality of 254 migration in DN - expressing NB is impaired . In summary , DNRac1a NB still move and 255 at similar rate velocities to controls but lose the persistence in directed migration . 256 We extended the analysis by abrogating ( DN ) and increasing ( CA ) the function of the 257 RhoGTPases Cdc42 and Rho1 in otic NB ( Fig . 3B - C , Movie 8 ) . In these conditions , we 258 found that NB have a reduced or recovered migratory capacities , respectively ( Fig . 3C , 259 asterisk ) . 260 261 Altogether , our data blocking and activating RhoGTPases reveal for the first time that 262 RhoGTPases pathway is required for a directed and active migration of delaminated otic 263 NB . This suggests that otic NB engage into active and complex behaviors to organize 264 the SAG , rather than undergoing passive and bulk organization . 265 266 NB display a characteristic migratory profile to a coalescence region 267 Under the findings that otic NB actively migrate , we then wondered about which were 268 the migratory paths followed by NB . Using CRISPR Eraser in Tg ( neurod : eGFP ) and 269 photoconverted cells in Tg ( neurod : kikume ) background , we tracked delaminating NB 270 starting at their initial point of delamination in the neurogenic domain for a period of 10 - 271 12 hours from the delamination peak of 20 - 24hpf until 34 - 36hpf . NB delaminating from 272 the anterolateral neurogenic domain follow a longer migratory path and move from lateral 273 9 to medial ( Fig . 4A , cyan color coded ; Movie 9 ) . On the other hand , NB delaminating 274 from posteromedial regions migrate anteriorly to the same region between the OV and 275 the HB ( Fig . 4B , green color coded ; Movie 10 ) . Wind rose plots of the directionality of 276 paths confirm this directed anteromedial migration of delaminated NB ( Fig . 4C , color 277 coding preserved ) . The tracking of many migrating NB ( n = 66 [ 43 lateral + 23 medial ] 278 cells from 40 embryos ) highlights their migratory directionality towards a region just 279 anterior and medial to the otic vesicle and attached to the hindbrain wall at rhombomere 280 4 ( Fig . 4F , asterisk ; Fig . 4G ) . Migration and coalescence to this region contributes to the 281 growth of the anterior lobe of the SAG ( Fig . 4G ) . We named this region the coalescence 282 region . Although it has been suggested that medial delaminated NB position in the 283 posterior lobe ( Dyballa et al . , 2017 ) , tracking of medial delaminated NB show that also 284 migrate and coalesce anteriorly . 285 286 Quantification of the time elapsed from delamination until cell reaching the coalescence 287 region , which normally coincides after a rapid movement of peak velocity , indicates that 288 it takes around 6h ( Fig4 . D , smaller black arrowhead and Fig . 4D , upper right corner panel ; 289 Supplementary figure 4C , 4C’ and 4E black arrowheads ) . 290 291 When the mean of instant velocities of NB against normalized distance covered is plotted , 292 a slight increase in velocity just right after delamination is appreciated to then display a 293 fluctuating walking behavior ( Fig . 4D , thick black arrowhead ) . NB interchange steady 294 moments with pulses of movement , which is indicative for the previously reported active 295 migration of NB and coinciding with the three different phases of behaviors described in 296 Fig 2A - B . Finally , they increase the velocity until they reach a region where they stop 297 and coalesce ( Fig . 4D , thin black arrowhead ; Supplementary Figure 5 distinguishing 298 lateral and medial delaminating NB behaviors ) . Quantified maximum velocity of 299 migration is 61’2µm / h ( Fig . 4D ) , maximum distance covered is 124µm and mean distance 300 migrated 66µm . MSD analysis with DiPER ( Gorelik & Gautreau , 2014 ) of our data shows 301 a slope ( black line ) of the linear fit that is greater than 1 ( α > 1 ) , which is indicative of 302 directed motion . For further detailed and separated analysis between more lateral and 303 more medial NB see Supplementary figure 5 . 304 305 Surprisingly , in some instances , we also observed otic delaminating NB being able to 306 incorporate into the anterior lateral line ( aLL ) ganglion and vice versa , suggesting that 307 10 both neuronal tissues are plastic receiving and sending neuronal progenitors ( Fig . 4E ; Fig . 308 4F white arrowhead ) whose fates are not fully determined yet . 309 310 We previously observed that delamination of NB can be collective . We then wondered if 311 migration of NB was also collective . Collective migration is defined by a group of cells 312 that keep cell - cell contacts , have group polarization and exhibit a coordinated behavior 313 relevant for the proper organization of the tissue ( Le et al . , 2022 ) . To address this 314 question , we observed in several cases two touching NB and their neighbors . As shown 315 in Fig . 4H , delaminated NB can either migrate non - collectively ( Fig . 4H , example 1 white 316 arrow ; Movie 11 ) interrupting their physical contact and NB separating each other . In 317 other cases , two touching cells migrate together ( Fig . 4H , example 2 , Movie 12 ) , 318 maintaining their physical contacts during the whole imaging period . Therefore , the data 319 suggests that NB migration within the SAG does not require permanent NB cell - cell 320 contact per se . 321 322 Nevertheless , our previous results indicated a common pattern of migration to the 323 coalescence region performing a migration in streams . When analyzing and plotting the 324 distance between several NB against the rest of the neighbor cells across time , a negative 325 linear regression appears , confirming NB coalescence as a common feature for migrating 326 NB ( Fig . 4I , black line ) . 327 328 In summary , NB delaminating from different regions of the neurogenic domain migrate 329 and aggregate around a particular region , which we called the coalescence region . The 330 coalescence of NB in this region gives rise to the anterior lobe of the SAG ( Movie 13 ) . 331 332 Pioneer SAG neurons populating the coalescence region are required for NB 333 migration and SAG organization 334 The coalescence region where delaminating NB aggregate is populated by bright neurod + 335 expressing cells . To assess the origin of these cells , we performed time - lapse analysis at 336 13 . 5hpf , before otic delamination begins . A group of few scattered cells expressing either 337 neurogenin1 , neurod or both are detected anterior to otic placode territories and posterior 338 to the trigeminal ganglion ( Fig . 5A ) . These cells migrate to anterior regions of the otic 339 vesicle ( Fig . 5A white dashed oval ) and apposed the 4 th rhombomere wall by 16hpf , 340 populating the location that will later become the coalescence region . From this group of 341 11 cells , the subset of neurogenin1 + - only cells , observed with the reporter line 342 Tg ( neurog1 : dsRed ) , ingress into the otic epithelium as shown previously in ( Hoijman et 343 al . , 2017 ) , whereas the subset of neurod + cells remain outside ( Fig . 5B - B’ ) . This latter 344 group was called pioneer SAG neurons , since they are the first ones populating the 345 prospective SAG ganglion . 346 347 To address whether pioneer SAG neurons have a role in migration and coalescence of 348 NB , at 16hpf we first photoconverted these cells in our Tg ( neurod : kikume ) line from 349 green to magenta and then ablated them with 2 - photon microscopy ( Fig . 6A ) . Attending 350 to different experimental conditions , whether pioneer SAG neurons remain unablated , 351 partial ( Fig . 6B , asterisk ) or total ablated , various SAG defects are found at later stages 352 ( Fig . 6B , blue dashed line indicates SAG shape in Z projections of images ) . In ablated 353 embryos , SAG shape is aberrant and the number of cells populating the SAG is reduced 354 at 24hpf ( Fig . 6B and 6C’’’ , n = 23 control cells , n = 36 ablated condition cells , from 4 355 embryos and 10 embryos , respectively ) . At 34hpf , the formation of the posterior lobe is 356 abrogated ( Fig . 6B , white arrowheads ) . SAG shape is altered because lack of pioneer 357 SAG neurons causes altered directionality patterns of migration and altered dispersion of 358 NB , found after tracking again , using DiPER , individual NB when SAG pioneer neurons 359 are missing ( Fig . 6C’ - C’’ , Movie 14 ; Supplementary figures 6 - 8 ) . Fig . 6C’’ shows , as in 360 Fig . 3E , a 95 % confidence interval of dispersion of NB at final position when normalized 361 at origin between control ( green ) and ablated ( magenta ) conditions . Non - overlapping 362 regions evidence differences in NB dispersion , which are statistically significant 363 according to Y axis distance ( Fig . 6C’’ ) . Although NB migrate less directionally , NB in 364 ablated condition are capable of migrating faster ( Fig . 6C’’’ upper panels ) . Moreover , 365 absence of pioneer SAG neurons affects the number of NB that form the SAG and 366 consequently , SAG volume is reduced ( Fig . 6C’’’ lower panels and Fig . 7 ) . 367 368 Altogether , our results point towards a fundamental role of pioneer SAG neurons in 369 recruiting delaminated NB and thus orchestrating the shape and growth of the SAG ( Fig . 370 7 ) . 371 372 373 374 375 12 Discussion 376 377 Morphogenetic events of cranial sensory ganglia development at the cellular level are 378 little understood in comparison to other model systems such as epithelial tissues . In this 379 work we provide , for the first time with cellular resolution and in vivo analysis , the cell 380 behaviours underlying NB delamination , migration and coalescence of the statoacoustic 381 ganglion . 382 383 NB otic delamination as an EMT process 384 Whether otic NB delamination follows an EMT program has been under debate . Some 385 authors have suggested that sensory neuron delamination in cranial placodes is not an 386 EMT event ( Graham et al . , 2007 ; Schlosser , 2008 , 2010 ) . It was reported that Snail family 387 of core - EMT transcription factors and RhoGTPases ( specially RhoB ) are not used in this 388 process ( Graham et al . , 2007 ) . Moreover , Sox9 / 10 , important EMT regulators , were 389 found to be absent in most Xenopus placodes ( Schlosser , 2008 , 2010 ) . Additionally , 390 migratory capacity of cranial placode NB seems diminished compared to neural crest 391 ( Schlosser , 2008 ) . However , other evidences suggest the contrary , where published gene 392 expression data and our imaging data points towards a delamination process in the inner 393 ear with EMT characteristics . 394 Otic delaminating NB express some EMT - associated genes such as sox9a / b ( Yan et al . , 395 2005 ) , sox10 ( Chiang et al . , 2001 ; Dutton et al . , 2009 ; Piloto & Schilling , 2010 ) , the 396 Spemann organizer gene goosecoid ( Kantarci et al . , 2016 ) , snail1b ( Léger & Brand , 2002 ; 397 Zecca et al . , 2015 ) and cdh6 ( LF , unpublished results and ( Hans et al . , 2013 ) ) , which is 398 known to be important for NCC migration ( Clay & Halloran , 2014 ) . Together with gene 399 expression changes , EMT is accompanied by large cell shape rearrangements , acquisition 400 of extensive migratory capacity , apicobasal polarity changes and cell adhesion 401 disassembly ( Yang et al . , 2020 ) . Finally , otic NB are still not postmitotic ( Camarero et 402 al . , 2003 ; Hoijman et al . , 2017 ) , meaning delamination is not strictly of neurons , as it is 403 in other placodes ( Graham et al . , 2007 ) . 404 We show here the changes in cytoarchitectural dynamics , apical determinant and primary 405 cilia relocalization during otic NB delamination . The sequence of cellular cell shape 406 changes involves an apical thinning , with most cytoplasm concentrating basally , an 407 eventual apical detachment from the lumen with some membrane remaining’s , 408 13 resembling what was described in neuronal neural tube delamination ( Das & Storey , 409 2014 ) ; extensive basal blebbing , lateral and basal filopodia extensions and final NB 410 translocation out of the epithelium . Blebbing has been shown to be an important 411 mechanism to facilitate basal lamina removal and EMT in zebrafish NCC ( Berndt et al . , 412 2008 ; Font - Noguera et al . , 2021 ; Paluch & Raz , 2013 ) . However , it is not clear yet in our 413 tissue whether blebbing occurs as an active property for facilitating 414 delamination / migration or a passive event due to forces from neighbouring cells and loss 415 of basal lamina and membrane integrity ( Schick & Raz , 2022 ) . 416 417 When imaging apical protein Pard3 localization during otic delamination , Pard3 is 418 partially kept in the apical membrane remaining’s after abscission , while a different 419 fraction travels basally in the hinge point of apical cytoplasmatic thinning , suggesting it 420 might provide information for the apical thinning process . In our system , compared with 421 the laterality organ of zebrafish ( Pulgar et al . , 2021 ) , partial delamination does not occur , 422 but once NB are out of the epithelium , Pard3 is dynamically rearranged while retained , 423 similarly as in in the zebrafish heart trabeculation ( Jiménez - Amilburu et al . , 2016 ) . Pard3 424 maintenance in pseudo - mesenchymal NB suggest that Pard3 could establish a new 425 polarity axis in migratory cells or inform where neurites must grow , as shown in some 426 mechanosensory neurons ( Lee et al . , 2021 ) . In NCC , relocalization of the centrosome on 427 the other side of the nucleus during EMT results in a polarity reversal and is responsible 428 for cell dispersal when become mesenchymal ( Burute et al . , 2017 ) . Moreover , Pard3 429 localization in cell - cell contacts during NCC migration promotes microtubule 430 disassembly ( Moore et al . , 2013 ) . 431 In chick , an actin - based apical constriction leaves an apical abscised part containing the 432 primary cilia membrane but centrosome remains in the delaminating cytosol ( Das & 433 Storey , 2014 ; Kasioulis et al . , 2017 ) . In our delaminating NB we observe internalization 434 of the primary cilium . The fact that the primary cilium is not dismantled nor kept on the 435 abscised membrane might favour rapid reestablishment of polarity once delaminated NB 436 are outside . Whether there is a passive apical membrane stretching and shearing while 437 recovering apical proteins and primary cilium or there is an active apical cell - autonomous 438 cytoskeletal rearrangement was not studied here . It is known than Cdh6 and RhoA in 439 apical domains lead to the apical constriction in NCC engaged into delamination in vivo 440 ( Clay & Halloran , 2014 ) . 441 14 In summary , data from our experiments and literature suggest that otic NB undergo an 442 EMT process when delaminating . 443 NB as active entities to organize the SAG 444 Once outside the otic neuroepithelia , otic NB acquire a much variable and rounded 445 shapes . We have shown delaminating NB actively engage into complex migratory 446 behaviours in a RhoGTPases - dependent manner . This suggests that NB migratory 447 capacity is more constrained by neighbouring tissues and signalling than by low 448 migratory capacity ( Graham et al . , 2007 ; Schlosser , 2008 ) . Moreover , it has been shown 449 that NCC touching the SAG maintain SAG aggregation but are not implicated in giving 450 migratory cues to NB ( Sandell et al . , 2014 ; Zecca et al . , 2015 ) . In NCC , reducing Rac1 451 and consequently reducing lamellipodia extensions affects NCC migration while 452 delamination still occurs . This indicates that these protrusive extensions are required to 453 generate a migratory force in NCC , and thus large protrusions might be required in our 454 tissue for the same purpose . 455 456 We have also seen NB can migrate either collectively or non - collectively . In a collective 457 migration , cells can move cryptically within the cluster ( Reig et al . , 2014 ) but the overall 458 migration is robust . In NCC tissue , E - cadherin helps maintaining stream migration while 459 Pard3 - N - Cadherin interactions avoids crowding by contact - inhibition of locomotion ( Clay 460 & Halloran , 2014 ; Moore et al . , 2013 ; Priya & Yap , 2015 ; Scarpa et al . , 2015 ) . If a temporarily regulated 461 and partial switch in adhesion molecules is necessary to maintain some sort of collective migration for 462 keeping tissue cohesiveness remains to be studied . We do know that itg5a is required for correct aggregation 463 of epibranchial placodes ( Bhat & Riley , 2011 ) , maintaining tissue segregation from other placodes 464 and cohesiveness within the tissue . 465 Another key finding of this work is that delaminated NB engage into active migration 466 towards a coalescence region , irrespectively of their origin location inside the neurogenic 467 domain and their delamination position . Thus , when NB delaminate they do not remain 468 in the same location , but rather migrate and coalesce anteriorly . This suggests that the 469 SAG organizes in a much more complex manner than assumed according to genetically 470 position information . 471 472 15 The Posterior Placodal Area providing Pioneer neurons as organizing centres for 473 SAG assembly 474 Neurogenic cells from the Posterior Placodal Area ( PPA ) were known to exist but thought 475 to contribute exclusively to aLL or the otic placode ( Andermann et al . , 2002 ) . Here we 476 show for the first time how PPA neuronal specified cells can contribute also to the SAG . 477 These cells have a pioneer role over otic delaminated NB and could also have a pioneer 478 role in the aLL . In addition , we also observe that , in some cases , delaminated NB can 479 integrate into the aLL and viceversa . Thus , at very early stages , neurogenic cells of the 480 PPA are still not fully committed and can be interchangeable between aLL and SAG , in 481 accordance to the hypothesis put forward in Abelló & Alsina , 2007 . The signals that help 482 pioneer SAG neurons to position anterior to the otic vesicle are unknown . The 483 SDF1 / cxcr4 system has a role on the lateral line primordium migration , however SDF1 484 has not been reported to be expressed in the otic placode . Molecules from the hindbrain 485 could also play a role driving pioneer SAG neuronal populations migration . Finally , chase 486 and run from NCC - placodal neuron interactions ( Theveneau et al . , 2013 ) is discarded due 487 to time window constrains as pioneer SAG neurons migrate before NCC invade the tissue . 488 NCC would have a later role in maintaining SAG cohesiveness as suggested ( Begbie & 489 Graham , 2001 ; Steventon et al . , 2014 ; Zecca et al . , 2015 ) . 490 Pioneer neurons and tracts were discovered in seminal studies in Drosophila ( Harrison , 491 1959 ) and recent studies show to be required for other neuronal cell body correct 492 positioning ( Karkali et al . , 2023 ) . In zebrafish , a group of pioneer neurons is required for 493 correct migration of later facial branchiomotor neurons ( Wanner & Prince , 2013 ) . Here , 494 we provide novel evidence on pioneer SAG neurons of non - otic origin that by positioning 495 adjacent to the otic vesicle have also a role on the migration of delaminated otic NB and 496 the organization of the anterior SAG lobe . 497 Our current work identifies a group of pioneer neurons with a role in otic NB migration 498 and coalescence depending on pioneer SAG neurons . This knowledge will expand our 499 understanding on the development of cranial ganglia , in which pioneer neurons prefigure 500 the definitive architecture and / or location of a neuronal tissue . 501 502 503 16 Materials and Methods 504 Fish maintenance and husbandry of transgenic lines 505 506 Zebrafish embryos and adults were maintained and handled according to standard 507 procedures at the aquatic facility of the Parc de Recerca Biomèdica de Barcelona ( PRBB ) , 508 in compliance with the guidelines of the European Community Directive and the Spanish 509 legislation for the experimental use of and as previously described ( M . , 2000 ) . Stable 510 transgenic lines were kept by means of alternate outcross with WT ( AB / Tü ) and incross , 511 generation after generation . Expansion of the lines were done every 1 , 5 - 2 years . Embryos 512 were kept under dark conditions at a temperature of either 23 or 28’5ºC in Danieau’s 513 solution . 514 For this study we used the following lines : 515 TgBAC ( neurod : eGFP ) nl1 labeling specified neuroblasts and neurons ( Obholzer et al . , 516 2008 ) ; Tg ( neurod : Gal4 ) line generated in the lab in which Gal4 expression is driven by 517 the neurod1 promoter , insertion by CRISPR Knock - in following the protocols from 518 ( Auer , Duroure , Cian , et al . , 2014a ; Auer , Duroure , Concordet , et al . , 2014 ; Auer & Del 519 Bene , 2014 ; Kimura et al . , 2014 ) using the gbait plasmid from ( Kimura et al . , 2014 ) ; 520 Tg ( neurod : Gal4 ; UAS : H2A - GFP ) combining the Tg ( neurod : Gal4 ) with injection of the 521 Tol2 plasmid [ UAS - H2A - GFP ] , kindly provided by Dr .

This treatment did not affect development in 532 controls . Embryos were staged as previously described ( Kimmel et al . , 1995 ) . In all 533 experimental conditions the embryos of control and experimental conditions were 534 siblings except when comparing DNRac1a with CRISPR Erasers . 535 536 17 Microinjection 537 538 Long and very thin injecting needles were done in an electrophysiology puller ( Sutter 539 instruments model P - 97 ) with the following protocol : P = 200 ; HEAT = 566 ; PULL = 90 ; 540 VEL = 70 ; TIME = 80 .

Imaging of embryos was 575 performed on an inverted Leica SP8 confocal system equipped with a 488 nm Argon - ion 576 laser ( LASOS , 488 nm laser power 2 . 5 mW at back focal plane at 100 % laser power ) , 577 405 , 561 , 633 laser diodes , motorized xy and z - galvo stage , 1 HyD and 2 PMT detectors 578 and a HC PL APO 20x / 0 , 75 IMM and CS2 objective ( # 506191 and # 506423 ) . The 488nm 579 laser excitation depended on the experiment but was always kept across samples for the 580 same and related experiments . For in vivo experiments it ranged from 0 , 1 to 10 % . For 581 fixed embryos , it could increase up to 80 % . Gain normally ranging between 600 - 900Hz 582 and off - set was never higher than 0 , 1 % .

Cross - talk was in 596 silico checked using FP base ( https : / / www . fpbase . org / spectra / ) . 597 Tissue drift was considered and corrected . Otic tissue moved anteriorly at a rate of or 4 - 598 10µm / h . Videos of up to 12 hours considered a total anterior drift of 120µm maximum . 599 600 Resonant scanning 601 To maximize temporal resolution time - lapse imaging of filopodia , the resonant mode 602 ( 8000 Hz ) of the Leica SP8 confocal microscope was used to achieve a high 603 19 spatiotemporal resolution .

Optimal 604 Z - size according to the objective was used ( normally 1 . 19µm with pinhole airy1 ) . 605 Confocal stacks and movies were flattened by maximum projections using FIJI ( ImageJ ) . 606 The rest of the parameters remained the same as described in the confocal live - cell 607 imaging section . 608 Photoconversion ( PhC ) 609 Photoconvertible transgenic embryos from Tg ( neurod : kikume ) were kept as much as 610 possible away from light to avoid spurious photoconversion , although basal levels are 611 always present in our hands . Circular or hand - free designed ROIs the size of few cells 612 was drawn in SP8 and SP5 inverted Leica microscope systems . In both microscopes , 613 photoconversion was performed with UV 405 laser line at 5 to 15 % diode power upon 614 ROI at 200Hz during 6 scans and 3D ROI aiming the center of the photoconverted region 615 to avoid same level of photoconversion from upper or lower planes , although inevitable 616 to some extent .

C’’ ) 95 % confidence interval 1178 of NB dispersion according to last timepoint position when tracks are normalized at origin in control ( green 1179 dots ) versus ablated ( magenta dots ) conditions . Non - overlapping regions evidence the variance in 1180 dispersion , which is significant in the Y axis ( * * * ) while non - significant in the X axis ( ns ) . Ticks in axes 1181 36 represent increase every 10µm . C’’’ ) NB are able to migrate faster ( * ) in the ablation condition . Mean 1182 migratory profile is not majorly affected , except that dispersion of velocity is increased in the ablated 1183 condition at initial stages of migration ( Supplementary figure 8 shows detailed individual migratory 1184 profiles ) . Number of cells populating the SAG is significantly reduced ( * ) in the ablation condition , more 1185 than the number of cells ablated ( Supplementary figure 6A ) and consequently SAG volume ( Supplementary 1186 figure 7 ) .
