Introduction The process of epithelial – mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is im - plicated in cancer progression , wound healing , and tissue fibro - sis as well as normal embryonic development ( Kalluri and Neilson , 2003 ; Thiery , 2003 ; Lee et al . , 2006 ) . In tissue fibrosis and wound healing , EMT is thought to contribute to generation of myofibroblasts and myofibroblast - like cells that mediate de - position of ECM proteins , such as collagens and fibronectin . In cancer , EMT leads to generation of more aggressive and inva - sive carcinoma cells as well as cancer stem cells . EMT involves disassembly of the polarized epithelial architecture and remod - eling of the cell cytoskeleton , including intermediate and actin filaments . TGF -  cytokines have emerged as major regulators of EMT in human diseases and embryonic development ( Zavadil and Böttinger , 2005 ) . TGF -  can induce EMT in normal and carcinoma cells , disrupting cell junctions and inducing actin fibers linked to focal adhesions ( Miettinen et al . , 1994 ; Fialka et al . , 1996 ; Oft et al . , 1996 ; Piek et al . , 1999 ; Bakin et al . , 2004 ; Brown et al . , 2004 ) . Under physiological conditions , TGF -  functions as a potent tumor suppressor , regulating normal tissue homeostasis , cell proliferation , and matrix deposition ( Stover et al . , 2007 ) . Malignant cancers are unresponsive to antimitogenic effects of TGF -  and produce elevated levels of TGF -  ( Walker and Dearing , 1992 ; Wikström et al . , 1998 ; Maehara et al . , 1999 ) . This has been linked to the induction of EMT in carcinoma cells , promoting tumor invasion , resistance to therapy , and met - astatic spread ( Maehara et al . , 1999 ; Huber et al . , 2005 ; Lee et al . , 2006 ; Stover et al . , 2007 ) . The mechanisms underlying TGF -  – induced EMT and fibrotic responses are not fully understood . TGF -  cytokines are deposited in the matrix in a latent / inactive form and are released in active form by various envi - ronmental signals ( Annes et al . , 2003 ) . Active TGF -  binds to the receptor complex and stimulates a set of signaling events , leading to changes in gene expression and cell behavior ( Pardali and Moustakas , 2007 ) . The EMT response to TGF -  requires transcription and de novo protein synthesis ( Bakin et al . , 2004 ) . T he process of epithelial – mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) in response to transforming growth factor –  ( TGF -  ) contributes to tissue fibrosis , wound heal - ing , and cancer via a mechanism that is not fully un - derstood . This study identifies a critical role of JunB in the EMT and profibrotic responses to TGF -  . Depletion of JunB by small interfering ribonucleic acid abrogates TGF -  – induced disruption of cell – cell junctions , formation of actin fibers , focal adhesions , and expression of fibrotic proteins . JunB contributes to Smad - mediated repression of inhibitor of differentiation 2 through interaction with transcription repressor activating transcription factor 3 . Importantly , JunB mediates the TGF -  induction of pro - fibrotic response factors , fibronectin , fibulin - 2 , tropomyosin ( Tpm1 ) , and integrin -  3 , which play critical roles in matrix deposition , cell – matrix adhesion , and actin stress fibers . In summary , JunB provides important input in setting the transcriptional program of the EMT and profibrotic re - sponses to TGF -  . Thus , JunB represents an important target in diseases associated with EMT , including cancer and fibrosis . JunB contributes to Id2 repression and the epithelial – mesenchymal transition in response to transforming growth factor –  Megan Gervasi , 1 Anna Bianchi - Smiraglia , 1 Michael Cummings , 1 Qiao Zheng , 1 Dan Wang , 2 Song Liu , 2 and Andrei V .

T H E J O U R N A L O F C E L L B I O L O G Y JCB • VOLUME 196 • NUMBER 5 • 2012 590 kidney epithelial cells . The study shows that JunB is an im - mediate early response gene of TGF -  – Smad signaling , and JunB is required for the repression of Id2 , a negative regulator of EMT , as well as for the up - regulation of factors mediating EMT and profibrotic responses . Thus , JunB may represent an important target in human diseases associated with EMT such as cancer and fibrosis . Results TGF -  – induced EMT is associated with Smad - dependent up - regulation of JunB Two well - established cell models of EMT and fibrotic responses have been used in this study : the mouse mammary epithelial cell line NMuMG ( Miettinen et al . , 1994 ; Piek et al . , 1999 ; Bakin et al . , 2000 ; Bhowmick et al . , 2001 ) and the murine kidney proximal tubular cell line murine cortical tubule ( MCT ; Wolf et al . , 1999 ; Kalluri and Neilson , 2003 ) . Treatment with TGF -  induced morphological EMT in both NMuMG and MCT cells within 24 h ( Fig . 1 A ) . Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed the disruption of cell – cell junctions and induction of actin stress fibers , characteristics of the TGF -  – induced EMT ( Fig . 1 C ) . Immunoblotting showed down - regulation of a tight junction protein ZO1 in NMuMG cells but not in MCT , whereas adherence junction protein E - cadherin was not re - duced by TGF -  in either cell line ( Fig . 1 B ) . RT - PCR dem - onstrated that mRNA levels of ZO1 and ZO2 and E - cadherin were not affected by TGF -  in NMuMG ( Fig . 1 E ) and MCT cells ( Fig . S1 ) . These findings are in agreement with previous studies showing that morphological transition , dissolution of cell junctions , and formation of actin fibers occur within 24 – 48 h of TGF -  treatment without down - regulation of E - cadherin ( Tian and Phillips , 2003 ; Brown et al . , 2004 ; Maeda et al . , 2005 ; Safina et al . , 2009 ) . Suppression of Smad4 blocked TGF -  – induced EMT in both cell lines ( shown for NMuMG cells ; Fig . 1 D ) , validating Smad dependency of this TGF -  response , as expected from previous studies ( Bakin et al . , 2004 ; Valcourt et al . , 2005 ; Deckers et al . , 2006 ) . To dissect the transcriptional program of TGF -  – induced EMT , mRNA levels of several transcription factors were as - sessed by semiquantitative RT - PCR . The analysis revealed that JunB , as well as Id2 , Hmga2 , Snai1 / Snail , and Snai2 / Slug , is regulated via Smad4 ( Fig . 1 E ) , although Snai1 and Snai2 are expressed at several - fold lower levels compared with JunB . Snai1 and Snai2 were up - regulated at 24 h but not at early time points of TGF -  treatment ( Fig . S2 A ) . Quantitative PCR confirmed low levels of Snai1 and Snai2 ( close to the background ) , whereas JunB , Id2 , and Hmga2 transcripts are expressed at least 50 - fold higher ( Fig . 1 F ) . These findings are consistent with lack of E - cadherin repression . In addi - tion , TGF -  – Smad signaling strongly induced fibrotic factors collagen 7a1 ( Col7a1 ) and fibronectin ( Fig . 1 E ) . JunB belongs to the Jun family of AP1 transcription factors , which together with Smads can regulate Col7a1 in keratinocytes ( Naso et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , JunB is up - regulated by TGF -  – Smad signal - ing and may contribute to the TGF -  – induced EMT and fi - brotic responses . Smad transcription factors , PI3 kinase , and MAPKs p38 and ERK have been implicated in EMT ( Zavadil and Böttinger , 2005 ) . Receptor - associated Smad3 and Smad4 play a major role in the EMT response ( Bakin et al . , 2004 ; Levy and Hill , 2005 ; Valcourt et al . , 2005 ) . Small GTPases Rac1 and RhoA contribute to EMT by activating p38 MAPK , PI3K - Akt , and Rho kinase signaling ( Bakin et al . , 2000 , 2002 ; Bhowmick et al . , 2001 ; Zavadil and Böttinger , 2005 ) . Recent studies suggest that TGF -  – induced EMT involves Smad - dependent down - regulation of inhibitor of differentiation 2 / 3 ( Id2 / 3 ) helix - loop - helix transcription factors ( Kondo et al . , 2004 ; Kowanetz et al . , 2004 ) . In some cell systems , TGF -  up - regulates Twist , Snail , Slug , and Hmga2 ( Moustakas and Heldin , 2007 ) . Forced expression of Hmga2 , Snail , or Twist alone can induce EMT , down - regulating E - cadherin and increas - ing cell migration ( Moustakas and Heldin , 2007 ) . Formation of actin stress fibers is a main characteristic of TGF -  – induced EMT . Smads regulate expression of proteins , mediating the formation of actin fibers ( tropomyosin Tpm1 ,  - actinin Actn1 , and calponin Cnn2 ) and focal adhesions , including palladin and integrins ( Bakin et al . , 2004 ; Valcourt et al . , 2005 ; Zheng et al . , 2008 ; Safina et al . , 2009 ; Bianchi et al . , 2010 ) . Tropomyosin - mediated actin fibers control tumor cell invasion and anchorage - independent growth ( Pawlak and Helfman , 2001 ; Zheng et al . , 2008 ; Safina et al . , 2009 ) . Actin fibers and focal adhesions are also actively involved in the deposition and remodeling of the ECM and may facilitate tissue fibrosis . Activating protein 1 ( AP1 ) transcription factors contrib - ute to various TGF -  biological responses ( Moustakas and Heldin , 2007 ) . The AP1 factors are dimeric complexes of the basic leucine zipper proteins representing the FOS , JUN , activat - ing transcription factor ( ATF ) / cAMP response element - binding , or musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma families ( Eferl and Wagner , 2003 ) . The leucine zipper domain mediates hetero - and homo - dimerization of these proteins , whereas the basic regions are re - sponsible for DNA binding . Fos and Jun can induce EMT and promote invasion in epithelial cell lines ( Ozanne et al . , 2007 ) , disrupting epithelial cell polarity without down - regulation of E - cadherin ( Fialka et al . , 1996 ) . Likewise , constitutive MEK1 - JUN signaling dissolves cell – cell junctions but does not suppress E - cadherin ( Pinkas and Leder , 2002 ) . Jun and JunB share exten - sive homology within the leucine zipper and basic domains , and JunB can rescue a lethal phenotype in Jun - null mice ( Passegué et al . , 2002 ) . Despite their homology , these proteins display different transcriptional activity . Jun is a strong transcriptional activator , whereas JunB is a modest trans - activator and may even repress transcription ( Finch et al . , 2002 ; Eferl and Wagner , 2003 ) . Both Jun and JunB can be induced by TGF -  in epithelial cells , whereas mesenchymal cells respond with up - regulation of JunB but not Jun ( Chung et al . , 1996 ) . Jun and JunB can in - teract with Smad factors ( Zhang et al . , 1998 ) and positively or negatively regulate Smad target genes ( Verrecchia et al . , 2001a ; Selvamurugan et al . , 2004 ; Wang et al . , 2008 ) . Although Jun family proteins have been implicated in TGF -  responses and / or the EMT process , their role in TGF -  – induced EMT has not been investigated . The present work addresses the function of JunB in TGF -  – induced EMT and fibrotic responses in mammary and 591 JunB in TGF -  – mediated EMT • Gervasi et al . An increase in JunB basal levels is likely to be associated with CHD - induced stress response . Next , we examined the contribu - tion of Smads to JunB regulation . Depletion of Smad4 blocked induction of both JunB and Tpm1 ( Fig . 2 C ) , indicating that JunB is a direct target of TGF -  – Smad signaling . To assess localization of JunB , we performed cellular fractionation experi - ments . Nuclear cytoplasmic fractionations showed that JunB and Jun are predominantly located in nuclear fractions , and TGF -  increased JunB levels in the nucleus ( Fig . 2 D ) . Binding of Smads to DNA can be facilitated by direct interaction with AP1 transcription factor ( Zhang et al . , 1998 ) . To assess JunB – Smad interactions , we performed immuno - precipitation studies with NMuMG cells . Cell lysates were pre - cipitated with Smad4 antibody followed by immunoblotting for JunB and vice versa . The study found JunB in Smad4 immune complexes and Smad4 in JunB precipitates ( Fig . 2 E ) , indicat - ing that JunB and Smad4 are present in the same complexes . JunB is a direct target and a partner of Smad - dependent transcription Early induction of JunB suggests its active role in the onset of the EMT program , although the dynamics of JunB regulation by TGF -  could be cell type specific ( Mauviel et al . , 1996 ) . Here , we assessed the JunB regulation and the link of JunB to Smad transcription factors . Immunoblotting showed up - regulation of JunB protein levels within 30 min of the TGF -  treatment , which is within the time frame of Smad2 phosphory - lation ( Fig . 2 A ) . In comparison , the induction of tropomyosin ( Tpm1 ) , a late - response target of TGF -  ( Bakin et al . , 2004 ) , was delayed by 4 h . To determine whether JunB is a direct target , we examined JunB regulation by TGF -  in the presence of cyclo - heximide ( CHD ) , an inhibitor of de novo protein synthesis . RT - PCR showed that CHD did not inhibit up - regulation of JunB mRNA , whereas suppression of Id2 and Ezr / Vil2 ( ezrin ) and up - regulation of Itgb3 and partly Fn1 were blocked ( Fig . 2 B ) .

JCB • VOLUME 196 • NUMBER 5 • 2012 592 for the TGF -  – induced morphological transition and disrup - tion of cell junctions . To determine whether JunB is sufficient to induce the transition , NMuMG and MCT cells were transduced with EGFP and JunB using a bicistronic retroviral vector . Immunoblotting revealed comparable levels of JunB in TGF -  – treated cells and in JunB - transduced cells ( Fig . 3 D ) . Protein levels of E - cadherin were not altered by forced expression of JunB in either cell line . Overexpression of JunB reduced ZO1 protein in NMuMG cells but not in MCT cells ( Fig . 3 D ) , which is in agreement with TGF -  response in parental cells ( Fig . 1 B ) . In both cell lines , JunB severely disrupted tight junctions ( ZO1 ) , adherens junctions ( E - cadherin ) , and continuous adhesion beltlike actin fibers , increasing linear actin fibers ( Fig . 3 E ) . Thus , forced ex - pression of JunB in polarized epithelial cells impairs organization of tight and adherens junctions and disrupts the actin cytoskel - eton architecture . JunB contributes to the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions in response to TGF -  The formation of an extensive network of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions is a distinct characteristic of TGF -  – induced EMT ( Miettinen et al . , 1994 ; Piek et al . , 1999 ; Bakin et al . , 2000 ) . It has been also suggested that the actin fibers and focal adhesions are critical mediators of EMT ( Bakin et al . , 2004 ; Bianchi et al . , 2010 ) . Given that forced expression of JunB altered the actin cytoskeleton ( Fig . 3 E ) , we asked whether sup - pression of JunB would block the induction of actin fibers and focal adhesions by TGF -  . NMuMG cells were depleted for JunB by siRNA , and actin filaments were assessed before and after TGF -  treatment . Formation of actin stress fibers and This interaction is independent of TGF -  treatment and is likely to occur in the nucleus , given nuclear localization of JunB ( Fig . 2 D ) . Immunoblotting revealed two bands of JunB in total and nuclear fractions , whereas only the upper band was seen in Smad4 immunoprecipitates ( Fig . 2 , D and E ) . The upper band may represent JunB with posttranslational modifications ( this question is under investigation ) . To determine whether JunB contributes to Smad - mediated transcription , cells were trans - fected with Smad - dependent luciferase reporter ( Smad - binding element [ SBE ] – Lux ) along with JunB , Smad4 , or both . JunB alone had no effect on a basal activity of the reporter , whereas Smad4 significantly increased basal reporter activity ( Fig . 2 F ) . Cotransfection of both JunB and Smad4 greatly enhanced the basal and TGF -  – induced reporter activities . Together , these find - ings demonstrate that transcription factor JunB is an immediate early target of TGF -  – Smad signaling . TGF -  increases JunB levels in the nucleus , where JunB forms a complex with Smad4 and enhances Smad - dependent transcription . Thus , JunB – Smad interaction may contribute to the TGF -  – induced EMT program . JunB is required for the disruption of cell – cell junctions in response to TGF -  To assess the role of JunB in TGF -  – induced EMT , NMuMG and MCT cells were depleted for JunB by siRNA to JunB ( Fig . 3 C ) . In both cell lines , suppression of JunB prevented TGF -  – induced disruption of cell junctions ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) and changes in cell morphology ( Fig . S1 ) , whereas these TGF -  responses were clearly observed in cells transfected with scramble con - trol siRNA . Down - regulation of ZO1 protein in NMuMG cells was blocked by depletion of JunB , whereas ZO1 mRNA levels were unchanged ( Fig . S1 ) . E - cadherin protein and mRNA lev - els were not affected ( Figs . 3 C and S1 ) . Thus , JunB is required Figure 2 . JunB is a direct target of TGF -  – Smad signaling and forms a complex with Smad4 .

Immunoblotting revealed a marked reduction of phos - pho - Tyr31 – Pax levels by JunB depletion , although integrin -  1 levels were not altered ( Fig . 4 B ) . Together , these findings show that JunB is required for TGF -  induction of actin stress fibers , forma - tion of focal adhesions , and integrin signaling . JunB contributes to the regulation of Tpm1 , a critical component of this response . Our findings suggest that JunB may contribute to the TGF -  induction of cell adhesion to matrix . To test this idea , the adhesion of NMuMG and MCT cells onto fibronectin - coated plates was examined after pretreatment with TGF -  1 for 24 h . A fourfold increase in adhesion by TGF -  treatment was found in control NMuMG and MCT cells , whereas siRNA to JunB abrogated this response ( Fig . 4 C ) . Accordingly , NMuMG cells overexpressing JunB exhibited threefold greater adhesion onto fibronectin than control cells ( Fig . 4 D ) . The addition of a cyclic RGD peptide , mimicking the integrin - recognized epitope in fibronectin , abrogated JunB - enhanced adhesion ( Fig . 4 E ) . JunB also increased basal levels of phospho - Tyr31 – Pax ( Fig . 4 F ) . localization of vinculin to focal adhesions were clearly observed in control NMuMG cells treated with TGF -  , whereas this re - sponse was blocked in cells transfected with siRNA to JunB ( Fig . 4 A ) . The induction of actin stress fibers by TGF -  – Smad signaling requires tropomyosins ( Tpm1 ; Bakin et al . , 2004 ) . Given the link between JunB and Smad signaling ( Fig . 2 ) , we examined whether JunB contributes to Tpm1 expression . Immunoblotting showed that Tpm1 protein levels were induced by TGF -  in NMuMG and MCT control cells but not in JunB - depleted cells ( Fig . 4 B ) . Tropomyosins stabilize actin fibers and enhance cell adhesion and integrin - mediated phosphorylation of tyrosine residues ( phospho - Tyr ) in paxillin ( Pax ; Zheng et al . , 2008 ; Safina et al . , 2009 ) . Probing with the 4G10 monoclonal antibody to phospho - Tyr showed that TGF -  increases phospho - Tyr levels in proteins with a molecular mass of 120 – 130 and 60 – 70 kD , whereas a prominent band at 90 kD was not sensitive to TGF -  ( Fig . 4 B ) . Depletion of JunB reduced phospho - Tyr levels in 120 – 130 - and 60 – 70 - kD proteins ( Fig . 4 B ) . Pax is a 68 - kD protein that plays a critical role in focal adhesions and Figure 3 .

JCB • VOLUME 196 • NUMBER 5 • 2012 594 599 genes in siRNA JunB cells . Nearly 40 % of TGF -  1 target genes were commonly up - regulated ( 328 gene probes ) and com - monly repressed ( 436 gene probes ) in siRNA JunB and control cells . Thus , the regulation of almost 60 % of the TGF -  target genes may depend on JunB . Pathway analysis revealed the JunB - dependent regulation of a large number of genes involved in cell proliferation as well as cell adhesion and motility ( Table 1 ) . We focused on helix - loop - helix protein Id2 , which is in - volved in cell proliferation and differentiation as well as it is a key negative regulator of TGF -  – induced EMT in epithelial cells ( Kondo et al . , 2004 ; Kowanetz et al . , 2004 ) . To validate the profiling data , RT - PCR analysis was performed for Id2 and several genes implicated in EMT , including chromatin - associated factor Hmga2 and transcription repressors Snai1 / Snail and Snai2 / Slug ( Thuault et al . , 2006 ) . This study confirmed that depletion of JunB prevents repression of Id2 and showed that levels of Hmga2 , Snai1 , and Snai2 were not affected ( Fig . 5 C ) . To complement siRNA studies , we examined mRNA levels of these genes in JunB - overexpressing cells . Surprisingly , expres - sion of Id2 was not affected , although JunB protein levels were comparable with TGF -  – treated cells ( Figs . 3 D and 5 D ) . Down - regulation of Id factors requires transcription repressor ATF3 ( Kang et al . , 2003 ; Bakin et al . , 2005 ) , which is regulated by TGF -  in NMuMG cells at the protein level ( Bakin et al . , 2005 ) . We found that depletion of JunB blocks up - regulation of Together , these results demonstrate that JunB contributes to the formation of actin fibers , cell – matrix adhesions , and inte - grin signaling in response to TGF -  . JunB in the regulation of the EMT transcription program in response to TGF -  Thus far , our findings revealed that JunB contributes to major events of EMT induced by TGF -  – Smad signaling : the disso - lution of cell junctions and formation of cell – matrix contacts . The EMT response to TGF -  involves a complex transcriptional program mediated by Smad3 and Smad4 , affecting expression of regulatory and structural genes ( Zavadil and Böttinger , 2005 ; Moustakas and Heldin , 2007 ; Safina et al . , 2009 ) . To assess the role of JunB in the TGF -  transcription program of EMT , an unbiased gene expression profiling study was performed using Affymetrix microarrays . Total RNA samples were prepared from scramble control and siRNA JunB – transfected cells that were treated with TGF -  1 for 24 h , the time needed for the disrup - tion of cell junctions and formation of actin fibers . Depletion of JunB altered expression of 891 genes ( 3 . 67 % ; 531 up - regulated and 360 down - regulated genes compared with control NMuMG cells ) . TGF -  1 regulated nearly 2 , 000 genes ( 8 . 1 % ; 1 , 976 gene probes ) by at least twofold in control cells ( Fig . 5 , A and B ) . Treatment with TGF -  1 up - regulated 813 genes in control and Figure 4 . JunB is required for TGF -  induction of actin fibers and cell adhesion .

Transcriptional repression of Id2 by TGF -  is mediated through AP1 sites To investigate the transcriptional regulation of Id2 by TGF -  , we explored the potential regulatory elements in the mam - malian Id2 promoter . The analysis of the published data and a 4 - kb region of the Id2 promoter are summarized in Fig . 6 A . Previous studies have reported that Myc family helix - loop - helix proteins are capable of inducing Id2 expression through E - box clusters 1 and 2 ( E - boxes - 1 and - 2 ) located upstream of the  2 . 2 - kb region ( Neuman et al . , 1995 ; Lasorella et al . , 2000 ) . To examine the role of these and other potential regulatory elements in TGF -  – mediated repression of Id2 , a 4 - kb fragment of mouse Id2 promoter was cloned into pGL2 luciferase reporter vector , and several deletion constructs were generated . The luciferase reporter activity of the full - length 4 - kb construct was reduced by 40 % by treatment with TGF -  1 , whereas the Id2 – 2266 construct showed comparable basal activity and was repressed by 50 % ( Fig . 6 B ) . However , the Id2 – 1353 construct was not repressed by TGF -  ( Fig . 6 B ) . The Id2 – 1353 construct lacks clusters of E - boxes - 1 and AP1 - like sites but includes the E - boxes - 2 cluster that is thought to be important for repres - sion of Id2 by TGF -  via Mad proteins ( Siegel et al . , 2003 ) . In addition , mRNA levels of Mads are not regulated by TGF -  in studied systems ( unpublished data ) . Thus , our results suggest that the E - boxes - 1 and AP1 sites within the  1353 – 2266 region could be responsible for TGF -  – mediated repression of Id2 , whereas E - boxes - 2 sites are unlikely to be involved in this response . Two of the three AP1 sites are conserved among human and mouse Id2 promoters , whereas E - boxes - 1 elements are present only in the human Id2 promoter ( Figs . 6 A and 7 D ) . To test the contribution of these elements to Id2 repression by TGF -  , we generated constructs with consecutive deletions of E - boxes - 1 and AP1 sites ( Fig . 6 C ) . Deletion of E - boxes - 1 ( pGL2 - Id2 – 1988 ) had no effect on the ability of TGF -  to re - press the reporter activity . The constructs with removed AP1 site 1 ( pGL2 - Id2 – 1703 ) or AP1 sites 1 and 2 ( pGL2 - Id2 – 1656 ) were still repressed by TGF -  ( Fig . 6 C ) . However , when all three sites were deleted , the repression by TGF -  was lost . To validate these findings , DNA fragments containing the E - boxes - 1 or three AP1 sites were inserted upstream of the pGL2 - Id2 – 107 construct carrying the  107 - bp region of the mouse Id2 promoter ( Fig . 6 A ) . The pGL2 - Id2 – 107 construct is not repressed by TGF -  ( Fig . 6 B ) . Addition of AP1 sites conferred the repression ATF3 , whereas forced expression of JunB had little effect on ATF3 ( Fig . 5 , E and F ) . This may account for the lack of repres - sion of Id2 in JunB - overexpressing cells . Together , these find - ings show that JunB contributes to the regulation of TGF -  target genes involved in key steps of EMT such as repression of Id2 , an antagonist of EMT , and formation of matrix adhesions ( fibronectin and tropomyosin ) . JunB does not affect Hmga2 and Snails , and this is consistent with the absence of E - cadherin repression ( Fig . 1 ) . Figure 5 .

JCB • VOLUME 196 • NUMBER 5 • 2012 596 repressed luciferase activity ( Fig . 7 A ) . Cotransfection of JunB and ATF3 resulted in a cooperative repression of the AP1 reporter activity ( Fig . 7 A ) . To assess the ability of JunB and ATF3 to repress endogenous Id2 , we generated NMuMG cells with con - stitutive expression of JunB and Tet - Off – regulated expression of ATF3 . Forced expression of ATF3 alone reduced Id2 mRNA and protein levels , and this was further enhanced in cells ex - pressing JunB ( Fig . 7 , B and C ) . Finally , to determine whether JunB and ATF3 bind to endogenous Id2 promoter , we analyzed the occupancy of the AP1 - containing region using chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) experiments ( Fig . 7 D ) . The ChIP assays showed that TGF -  stimulated the AP1 site occupancy by JunB and ATF3 ( Fig . 7 E ) . Together , these finding argue that JunB and ATF3 cooperate in repression of the Id2 promoter activity by TGF -  via AP1 regulatory elements . JunB mediates transcriptional regulation of proteins involved in the TGF -  fibrotic response Our findings indicate that JunB contributes to the regulation of fibronectin , Col7a1 , and tropomyosin ( Figs . 1 and 4 ) , which are ultimately involved in EMT and fibrosis . To validate our data , we performed RT - PCR analysis and explored the contri - bution of JunB to the regulation of fibronectin , an important component of TGF -  – mediated EMT ( Yi et al . , 2002 ; Câmara and Jarai , 2010 ) . Semiquantitative RT - PCR of total RNA by TGF -  , whereas the E - boxes were not effective ( Fig . 6 D ) . To confirm that the AP1 - like sites are indeed regulated by AP1 factors , the pGL2 - Id2 - AP1 construct was cotransfected with an expression vector for c - Jun . The activity of the pGL2 - Id2 - AP1 reporter was increased by c - Jun in a dose - dependent manner , although TGF -  still exerted a negative effect on the reporter ( Fig . 6 D ) . In agreement with these findings , cotransfection of dominant - negative c - Jun ( A - Jun ) or c - Fos ( A - Fos ) repressed the full - length Id2 reporter ( Fig . 6 E ) . Together , these findings demonstrate that negative regulation of Id2 by TGF -  is medi - ated via AP1 binding sites within the  1570 – 1703 region of the Id2 promoter . JunB and ATF3 cooperate to mediate transcriptional repression of Id2 by TGF -  Thus far , our results show that TGF -  increases levels of JunB , a component of the AP1 transcription factor , and suppresses AP1 - dependent transcription . JunB is also required for up - regulation of ATF3 , a basic leucine zipper protein ( Fig . 5 E ) . ATF3 / LRF - 1 lacks trans - activating activity and represses AP1 - dependent transcription by forming heteromeric complexes with Jun family proteins , including JunB ( Hsu et al . , 1993 ; Chen et al . , 1994 ) . To determine whether JunB and ATF3 repress AP1 - dependent transcription , cells were transfected with the AP1 luciferase reporter and JunB , ATF3 , or both . Increasing amounts of JunB moderately stimulated the AP1 reporter , whereas ATF3 Figure 6 . Repression of Id2 by TGF -  is mediated via AP1 sites .

Immunoblotting confirmed com - parable amounts of Smads and JunB in cotransfection experi - ments ( unpublished data ) . Transfection of Smad3E increased basal promoter activity , whereas cotransfection of JunB and Smad3E increased the basal and TGF -  – induced activity of the promoter ( Fig . 8 F ) . Transfection of Smad4 alone was not effec - tive , whereas cotransfection with JunB increased the TGF -  – induced activity of the promoter ( Fig . 8 F ) . Thus , it appears that JunB cooperates with Smad3 and Smad4 in the regulation of fibronectin . Discussion This study provides evidence that AP1 transcription factor JunB plays an important role in TGF -  – induced EMT and profibrotic responses . Knockdown of JunB by siRNA blocks the disso - lution of cell – cell junctions , production of profibrotic proteins , and formation of cell – matrix adhesions . Consistent with these findings , JunB - depleted cells show a significant reduction in cell – matrix adhesion . JunB is an immediate early target gene in TGF -  – Smad signaling . JunB in cooperation with ATF3 medi - ates the repression of Id2 , an antagonist of the TGF -  – induced EMT . Basic leucine zipper proteins JunB and ATF3 repress the Id2 promoter activity in response to TGF -  via AP1 regulatory elements . In addition , JunB contributes to up - regulation of the key components of actin stress fibers and cell – matrix adhesions . Thus , JunB provides a critical input in the onset of the TGF -  transcriptional program of EMT and profibrotic responses . Components of the AP1 transcription factor are implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis ( Ozanne et al . , 2007 ) . Among AP1 proteins , JunB and JunD have no transforming activity , whereas Jun , Fos , and FosB can transform cells in culture ( Eferl and Wagner , 2003 ) . Here , forced expression of JunB induced partial EMT in two epithelial cell lines , disrupting tight junc - tions and adherens junctions . In comparison , overexpression from JunB - depleted cells confirmed that JunB is critical for up - regulation of Col7a1 , fibronectin - 1 ( Fn1 ) , and fibulin - 2 ( Fbln2 ) as well as genes involved in the actin cytoskeleton ( tropomyosin [ Tpm1 ] and ezrin [ Ezr / Vil2 ] ) and cell – matrix adhesion ( integrin -  3 [ Itgb3 ] ; Fig . 8 A ) . Tropomyosin is required for the TGF -  in - duction of actin stress fibers and enhances focal adhesions and integrin signaling ( Zheng et al . , 2008 ) . Villin - 2 / ezrin links the actin cytoskeleton to the peripheral plasma membrane , regulating cell surface structure , adhesion , and migration ( Louvet - Vallée , 2000 ) . Complementary analysis of JunB - expressing cells showed that JunB increases basal levels of Col7a1 , Fn1 , Fbln2 , and Itgb3 transcripts , whereas Tpm1 and Ezr are not modulated ( Fig . 8 A ) . The regulation of two novel JunB targets , Itgb3 and Fbln2 , in JunB - expressing cells was confirmed by quantitative RT - PCR ( Fig . 8 B ) . These findings identify novel JunB targets that repre - sent ECM components , their receptors , and proteins stabilizing cell adhesion structures . Given that fibronectin plays a central role in tissue fibrosis ( Hsu et al . , 2008 ; Kadler et al . , 2008 ) and enhances EMT ( Yi et al . , 2002 ; Câmara and Jarai , 2010 ) , we further investigated the link of JunB to fibronectin expression in response to TGF -  . To confirm that JunB regulates fibronectin production , we exam - ined fibronectin levels and localization in JunB - overexpressing NMuMG cells . Immunofluorescence showed that JunB - expressing cells have significant levels of fibronectin in both the cytoplasm and extracellular space compared with control cells ( Fig . 8 C ) , with a twofold increase in fibronectin protein within the cell area ( Fig . 8 D ) . To examine whether JunB regulates fibronectin transcription , luciferase reporter assays were performed with a fragment of the human FN1 promoter . Depletion of JunB by siRNA markedly decreased the reporter activity in response to TGF -  but did not affect the basal activity ( Fig . 8 E ) . Transfec - tion of JunB increased the basal and TGF -  – induced activity of the reporter as compared with the control ( Fig . 8 F ) . Next , we tested whether JunB cooperates with Smads in Fn1 regulation Figure 7 . JunB and ATF3 cooperate to mediate transcriptional repression of Id2 by TGF -  . ( A ) NMuMG cells were cotrans - fected with AP1 - Lux luciferase reporter , a Renilla luciferase re - porter under the control of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter , and increasing amounts of JunB and ATF3 ( 1 , 2 , and 4 µg ) or both factors together ( 2 µg each ) .

JCB • VOLUME 196 • NUMBER 5 • 2012 598 ( Fig . 7 A ) , whereas Jun increases ezrin expression ( Gao et al . , 2009 ) , and ezrin is induced upon cell transformation by the Fos – Jun complex ( Miao and Curran , 1994 ; Jooss and Müller , 1995 ; Lamb et al . , 1997 ) . Thus , despite the phenotypic simi - larities in morphological transitions by Jun and TGF -  – JunB signaling , the underlying molecular mechanisms are likely to be different . Expression of JunB is regulated by various stimuli , includ - ing TGF -  , activin , IL6 , IL11 , and bone morphogenetic proteins 2 / 4 ( BMP2 / 4 ; Pertovaara et al . , 1989 ; Baumann et al . , 1991 ; Laiho et al . , 1991 ; Nakajima and Wall , 1991 ; Hashimoto et al . , 1993 ; Yin et al . , 1993 ; Hollnagel et al . , 1999 ) . However , it appears that only TGF -  , but not BMP and activin , induces the EMT - like response ( Piek et al . , 1999 ) . TGF -  induces a prolonged up - regulation of JunB for at least 24 h ( Fig . 2 ) . In comparison , BMP causes only a transient up - regulation of JunB and a sustained increase in c - Jun ( Hollnagel et al . , 1999 ) . The differential regu - lation of Jun and JunB or their partners may govern the ability of these growth factors to induce EMT . For example , JunB and Jun can form distinct dimeric complexes with other basic leu - cine zipper proteins of the Fos , ATF , and musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma families ( Eferl and Wagner , 2003 ) . Our findings , for the first time , demonstrate a key role of JunB in repression of Id2 in response to TGF -  . Id2 controls cell proliferation and inhibits TGF -  – induced EMT ( Kondo et al . , 2004 ; Kowanetz et al . , 2004 ) . Previous studies have shown that BMPs up - regulate expression of helix - loop - helix proteins Id1 , Id2 , and Id3 ( Hollnagel et al . , 1999 ) , whereas TGF -  represses these genes ( Kang et al . , 2003 ; Kondo et al . , 2004 ; Kowanetz et al . , 2004 ) . It has been shown that Id1 repression is mediated through a Smad3 – ATF3 complex ( Kang et al . , 2003 ) , whereas the Id2 repression is thought to be mediated by Mad binding at E - boxes within the Id2 promoter ( Siegel et al . , 2003 ) . Here , we found no evidence for this latter mechanism in NMuMG cells . Instead , our findings argue that AP1 sites within the  1570 – 1703 region of the Id2 promoter are important for repression of Id2 by JunB and ATF3 ( Fig . 6 ) . TGF -  – Smad signaling up - regulates JunB , which is required for sustained induction of ATF3 ( Fig . 5 ) . The JunB – ATF3 complex has been shown to repress AP1 - driven transcription ( Hsu et al . , 1992 , 1993 ) . Our work reveals that JunB cooperates with ATF3 in repressing endogenous Id2 expression and the Id2 promoter reporter ( Fig . 7 ) . ChIP assays show that TGF -  stimulates binding of both ATF3 and JunB at the genomic region containing the AP1 sites ( Fig . 7 E ) . This mechanism is consistent with a previous report that ATF3 is a negative regulator of Id1 ( Kang et al . , 2003 ) , whereas our data indicate that JunB is likely to be a partner of ATF3 in the AP1 repressor complex . TGF -  regulates cell adhesion and matrix receptors ( inte - grins ) in various cell types ( Heino et al . , 1989 ; Ignotz et al . , 1989 ; Spurzem et al . , 1993 ) . Our results show that JunB mediates TGF -  – stimulated cell – matrix adhesion in epithelial cell sys - tems , contributing to the induction of Itgb3 and actin - stabilizing protein tropomyosin ( Figs . 3 and 8 ) . In addition , JunB facili - tates the expression of matrix proteins such as fibronectin , Fbln2 , and Col7a1 ( Fig . 8 ) . Accordingly , basal and TGF -  – induced integrin signaling is markedly affected by modulation of Jun induces loss of epithelial polarity , disrupting cell junc - tions in the mammary epithelial cell line EpH4 ( Fialka et al . , 1996 ) . Both JunB and Jun do not affect expression of E - cadherin ( Fig . 1 E ; Fialka et al . , 1996 ) . Consistent with these results , TGF -  and JunB did not induce appreciable levels of Snail and Slug , transcriptional repressors of E - cadherin ( Figs . 1 and 5 ) . Interestingly , the EMT conversion by Jun in EpH4 cells results in down - regulation of JunB and PAI - 1 ( Fialka et al . , 1996 ) , whereas these two proteins are induced by TGF -  during EMT in mammary NMuMG and kidney MCT epithelial cells . In addition , TGF -  – JunB signaling down - regulates ezrin / Vil2 Figure 8 . JunB contributes to the induction of profibrotic proteins by TGF -  .

Moses . pGL2 - Id2 – 2266 and pGL2 - Id2 – 107 constructs ( Karaya et al . , 2005 ) were provided by Y . Yokota ( University of Fukui , Fukui City , Japan ) . Con - structs pGL2 - Id2 – 4088 , – 1988 , – 1703 , – 1656 , and – 1570 were gener - ated by PCR using mouse genomic bacterial artificial chromosome clone RP23 - 356E7 ( Roswell Park Cancer Institute ) containing the mouse Id2 pro - moter . These constructs included the 224 - bp coding region and were cloned at KpnI – XhoI sites . Constructs pGL2 - Id2 - AP1 and pGL2 - Id2 – Eboxes - 1 were generated by the cloning of PCR fragments from the  4088 – 224 region into pGL2 - Id2 – 107 at KpnI – XhoI sites . pGL2 - Id2 – 1353 was produced by excision of the  2256 – 1354 region from pGL2 - Id2 – 2266 using PstI . The identity of constructs was verified by sequencing . Retroviral infection of cells Retroviruses were prepared by transfection of Phoenix cells with 10 µg DNA per 100 - mm dish of pBMN - IRES - EGFP or pBMN - mJunB - IRES - EGFP using of JunB levels ( Fig . 3 ) . It appears that JunB cooperates with Smad3 and Smad4 in the activation of the target genes such as fibronectin . In some cell systems , however , JunB may re - duce Smad - dependent transcription ( Verrecchia et al . , 2001b ) . Smad proteins form distinct oligomeric complexes in response to TGF -  ( Jayaraman and Massague , 2000 ) , and it is conceiv - able that JunB interacts with a subset of Smad complexes , af - fecting DNA binding affinity and the pattern of gene regulation ( Zhang et al . , 1998 ) . Thus , JunB provides an additional level in the regulation of specific TGF -  target genes contributing to actin fibers , focal adhesions , and matrix deposition . JunB mediates the TGF -  induction of actin stress fibers and cell – matrix adhesions that are implicated in the tumor sup - pressor function of TGF -  ( Safina et al . , 2009 ; Bianchi et al . , 2010 ) . On the other hand , E - cadherin expression is not affected by either TGF -  or JunB in the studied model cell systems . This is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that repression of E - cadherin is not required for the EMT response to TGF -  ( Tian and Phillips , 2003 ; Maeda et al . , 2005 ; Safina et al . , 2009 ) . The role of JunB in the tumor suppressor function of TGF -  apparently contradicts the current idea of EMT as a process that underlies tumor invasion and metastasis . This novel JunB activity is consistent with the antitumor function of JunB in leukemia ( Eferl and Wagner , 2003 ; Steidl et al . , 2006 ) . Indeed , JunB - deficient mice develop B - lymphoid leukemia , and loss of JunB is found in human leukemia ( Ott et al . , 2007 ) . In addition , JunB inhibits Ras transformation and cell proliferation , reducing expression of cyclin D1 and increasing p16 / INK4A ( Eferl and Wagner , 2003 ) . Consistent with this finding , tropomyosin , a JunB target , and on - cogenic Ras have opposite effects on cell invasion and anchorage - independent growth , affecting actin stress fibers and cell – matrix adhesion ( Safina et al . , 2009 ) . JunB may interfere with function of Fra1 / Fosl1 and Jun , mediators of Ras transformation , in the regulation of Tpm1 and actin fibers . Indeed , Fos - induced trans - formation suppresses Tpm1 expression but increases expression of ezrin / Vil2 ( Jooss and Müller , 1995 ; Gao et al . , 2009 ) , which is repressed by the TGF -  – Smad - JunB axis ( Fig . 7 ) . Fra1 and Jun are frequently up - regulated in advanced - stage cancers ( Eferl and Wagner , 2003 ) and may modify the EMT response to TGF -  in cancer progression . In summary , our study reveals an important role for JunB in the EMT program and profibrotic responses to TGF -  ( Fig . 9 ) . JunB functions as an immediate early factor that en - ables the transcriptional control of the EMT antagonist Id2 and key factors contributing to actin cytoskeleton remodel - ing , formation of adhesion structures , and matrix composition . The TGF -  profibrotic response is an integral part of the EMT process and may underlie the disruption of cell – cell junctions ( Bianchi et al . , 2010 ) . Thus , JunB may represent an important biomarker and a therapeutic target in treatment of cancer and human diseases linked to EMT and tissue fibrosis .

TGF -  – Smad signaling up - regulates JunB , which , in turn , contributes to a negative and positive regulation of TGF -  target genes . JunB promotes a sustained induc - tion of ATF3 and , in cooperation with ATF3 , mediates repression of Id2 , a negative regulator of TGF -  – induced EMT . In addition , JunB contributes to the regulation of proteins that are essential for the formation of actin stress fibers ( tropomyosin ) , focal adhesions ( Itgb3 ) , and components of the ECM ( Fn1 , Fbln2 , and Col7a1 ) . JunB also contributes to suppression of ezrin ( Ezr / Vil2 ) and ZO1 . TJ , tight junctions ; AJ , adherens junctions ; IF , intermediate filaments ; HD , hemidesmosomes . JCB • VOLUME 196 • NUMBER 5 • 2012 600 Immunoblot analysis of whole - cell extracts and immunoprecipitates was performed as previously described ( Bakin et al . , 2002 ) . Protein sam - ples were separated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes . Membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies in 5 % milk followed by a 1 - h incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies . Immune complexes were visualized using the West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) or ECL ( GE Healthcare ) . Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation NMuMG cells in 5 % serum DME were treated with 2 ng / ml TGF -  1 . Cells were washed with PBS , scraped , and collected into 1 . 5 - ml tubes . Cell pellets were resuspended in a hypotonic solution ( 10 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 3 , 10 mM KCl , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 4 % NP - 40 , 50 mM NaF , and 1 mM DTT supplemented with 0 . 5 mM PMSF and a protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) . Mixtures were placed on ice for 5 min before centrifuga - tion at 15 , 000 rpm for 1 min at 4°C . Cytoplasmic fractions were trans - ferred to fresh tubes . Nuclear pellets were washed with hypotonic solution and resuspended in a high - salt buffer ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 3 , 400 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 50 mM NaF , and 1 mM DTT ) supple - mented with 0 . 5 mM PMSF and a protease cocktail ( Roche ) . Tubes were rotated at 4°C for 15 min and centrifuged at 16 , 100 g for 1 min at 4°C . Supernatants containing nuclear fractions were transferred to fresh tubes . Protein extracts ( 50 µg / lane ) were further subjected to immunoblotting . Affymetrix microarrays Microarray analysis was performed using the Mouse MOE430 _ 2AB chips ( Affymetrix ) . Total RNA samples were isolated from NMuMG and NMuMG cells transfected with siRNA to JunB that were treated or left un - treated with 2 ng / ml TGF -  1 for 24 h . The MAS5 . 0 algorithm in the Affy package of Bioconductor in the R statistical computing environment was used to generate expression summary values followed by trimmed mean global normalization to bring the mean expression values of all chips to the same scale . For data quality control , MAS5 . 0 present / absent calls were used to filter out probe sets whose expression intensities were close to back - ground noise ( i . e . , absent ) across all samples . Genes that were altered with a minimal of twofold change were considered significant for further analysis . The function classification and statistical overrepresentation of gene function categories ( e . g . , Gene Ontology terms ) were analyzed using the National Center for Biotechnology Information DAVID package ( Reich et al . , 2006 ) . RT - PCR analysis Total RNA was extracted using a PerfectPure RNA Cultured Cell kit ( 5 PRIME , Inc . ) . Primer sequences are listed in Tables S1 ( semiquantita - tive ) and S2 ( quantitative PCR ) . Amplification of transcripts was performed using the one - step RT - PCR system ( Invitrogen ) with 100 ng total RNA ac - cording to the manufacturer’s protocol . The optimal number of PCR cycles was determined for each primer set to ensure a linear range of amplifica - tion . PCR products were resolved on 1 % agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining . For quantitative RT - PCR , first - strand cDNA was synthesized from 3 µg total RNA using a random hexamer mixture and Superscript III ( both from Invitrogen ) in a 20 - µl reaction according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Quantitative real - time PCR was performed using 1 µl of first - strand cDNA . Each primer set was designed to span an intron to avoid amplification of contaminating genomic DNA . PCR was performed with SYBR green real - time PCR master mix ( Invitrogen ) using the default parameters of the 7700 sequence detection system ( ABI PRISM ; Applied Biosystems ) . To compare gene expressions between samples , the threshold cycle ( CT ) value was normalized using the mean CT for the reference gene , 18S ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) . The normalized mRNA level was defined as  CT = CT ( test gene )  CT ( mean for the reference gene ) . The final data were expressed as the fold difference between the test sample and the control sample , which was defined as 2 (  CT test   CT control ) . All reactions were performed in triplicate , and the experiments were repeated at least twice . The results are presented as the mean of at least two experiments . siRNA RNA duplexes against JunB and Smad4 were prepared at Invitrogen . The siRNA sequences are sense 5  - ACACCAACCUCAGCAGUUAUU - 3  and antisense 5  - UAACUGCUGAGGUUGGUGUUU - 3  for JunB and sense 5  - AUGGGCAAAGGAGUGCAGUUGGAUU - 3  and antisense 5  - AAUC - CAACUGCACUCCUUUGCCUAU - 3  for Smad4 . A scramble control RNA duplex labeled with Rhodamine was obtained from QIAGEN . Cells were transfected with RNA duplexes ( 200 nM for Smad4 and 50 nM for JunB ) FuGENE 6 reagent ( Roche ) . Supernatants were collected and filtered through 0 . 4 - µm filters and then used to infect NMuMG and MCT cells in the presence of 8 µg / ml Polybrene ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . 3 d later , GFP - positive cells were selected by flow cytometry . Generation of NMuMG – Tet - Off – ATF3 - EGFP / JunB cells NMuMG – Tet - Off cells were generated by cotransfection with pBabe - Puro and ptTA - IRES - Neo plasmids ( Yu et al . , 1999 ) with FuGENE 6 according to man - ufacturer’s protocol . Puromycin - resistant clones exhibiting TGF -  responses equal to parental cells were selected in the presence of 1 µg / ml puromycin . Individual NMuMG - tTA clones with a tight regulation of the Tet - responsive pTRE - Lux reporter ( BD ) and intact TGF -  responses were chosen to generate inducible cell lines . Mouse ATF3 cDNA was excised from pCG - ATF3 and subcloned into pBluescript II ( KS + ) ( Agilent Technologies ) at BamHI – XbaI sites and then shuttled into pTRE2hyg ( BD ) at NotI – SalI sites to generate pTRE2hyg - ATF3 . The NMuMG – tTA - 22 was transfected with pTRE2hyg - ATF3 using FuGENE 6 . Cells were selected with 200 µg / ml hygromycin in the presence of 2 µg / ml tetracycline . Clone 21 of NMuMG – Tet - Off – ATF3 cells was transduced with pBMN - IRES - EGFP or pBMN - mJunB - IRES - EGFP retrovi - ruses in the presence of tetracycline , and GFP - positive cells were selected by flow cytometry . To induce expression of ATF3 , NMuMG cells were washed twice with 1× PBS while in suspension and then seeded in tissue culture dishes , and the media was replenished the next day . Induction of ATF3 was confirmed by immunoblotting . Luciferase reporter assay The following firefly luciferase ( Luc ) reporters were used to measure transcrip - tional responses : SBE - Lux , AP1 - Lux , FN1 - Lux , pGL2 - Id2 – 4088 , pGL2 - Id2 – 2266 , pGL2 - Id2 – 1988 , pGL2 - Id2 – 1703 , pGL2 - Id2 – 1656 , pGL2 - Id2 – 1570 , pGL2 - Id2 – 1353 , pGL2 - Id2 – 107 , pGL2 - Id2 - AP1 , and pGL2 - Id2 – E - boxes - 1 . NMuMG cells were transfected with 1 µg Luc reporter and 0 . 025 µg pCMV – Renilla reniformis luciferase ( Rl ; Promega ) or 0 . 2 µg pTK - Rl ( provided by J . Black , Roswell Park Cancer Institute , Buffalo , NY ) in 6 - well plates ( 10 6 cells / well ) using FuGENE 6 reagent and according to the manufacturer’s protocol . The next day , cells were transferred into a 48 - well plate ( 2 × 10 4 cells / well ) . The cells were treated with 2 ng / ml TGF -  1 for 24 h . All TGF -  1 treatments were performed in the presence of 5 % FBS . Luc and Rl activities were determined in cell lysates using the Dual - Luciferase reporter assay sys - tem ( Promega ) , according to the manufacturer’s protocol , in a microplate luminometer ( Veritas ; Promega ) . Firefly activity was normalized to Renilla activity and presented as relative luciferase units . All assays were performed in triplicate wells , and each experiment was repeated at least twice . Fluorescence microscopy Cells were grown on glass coverslips ( 22 × 22 mm ) and treated with 2 ng / ml TGF -  1 for 24 h . The cells were fixed with 4 % PFA and permeabilized with 0 . 05 % Triton X - 100 ( for E - cadherin , vinculin , and fibronectin staining ) or with 100 % methanol for ZO1 staining and then blocked with 3 % milk in PBS for 30 min at room temperature . The cells were incubated for 1 h with anti - bodies to vinculin , ZO1 , E - cadherin , and / or fibronectin ( 1 : 400 dilution ) in 1 % milk / PBS followed by incubation for 30 min with Texas red – conjugated secondary antibody ( 1 : 500 ) at room temperature . Actin filaments were stained with phalloidin conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or 568 ( 1 : 200 ) . Fluor - escence images were taken with a Plan Apochromat 60× / 1 . 40 NA oil ob - jective lens at ambient temperature using an inverted microscope ( TE2000 - E ; Nikon ) equipped with a charge - coupled device camera ( CoolSNAP HQ ; Photometrics ) . The images were acquired using MetaVue imaging software ( v6 . 2 ; Molecular Devices ) . Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting NMuMG cells were grown in 5 % serum DME and treated with 2 ng / ml TGF -  1 for 2 h . To prepare whole - cell extracts , cells were washed with PBS and then lysed in NP - 40 lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % NP - 40 , 10 % glycerol , 20 mM NaF , and 1 mM Na orthovanadate supplemented with 1 mM PMSF and a protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) . Protein concentrations were measured using a detergent - compatible protein assay ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) according to the manufac - turer’s protocol . Lysates were precleared with 30 µl protein A / G agarose beads ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . ) . Precleared lysates ( 400 µg / anti - body ) were incubated with 2 µg of antibodies to Smad4 or JunB or an appropriate control IgG in 500 µl NP - 40 lysis buffer overnight with rotation at 4°C . Lysates were incubated with 40 µl protein A / G agarose beads for 1 h , rotating at 4°C . The immunocomplexes were washed twice in NP - 40 lysis buffer and once with PBS . Finally , the pellets were resuspended in equal volume of 2× loading buffer . 601 JunB in TGF -  – mediated EMT • Gervasi et al . Bakin , A . V . , N . V . Stourman , K . R . Sekhar , C .

The media was replenished after 8 h , and cells were grown for 1 d before proceeding with further experiments . Cell adhesion Fibronectin was purchased from Sigma - Aldrich . The wells of 96 - well plates were coated by incubating with fibronectin ( 10 µg / ml in PBS ) for 1 h at 37°C and then blocked with 10 mg / ml BSA . Cells were seeded at 2 × 10 4 / well in 5 % serum DME in six replicates . After 30 min for NMuMG cells and 15 min for MCT cells , nonadherent and loosely attached cells were removed from the wells by gently washing with PBS . Attached cells were fixed with 5 % glutaraldehyde and washed with PBS . Cells were counted at 100× magnification . The results were expressed as the mean value ± SD from two independent experiments . ChIP assay NMuMG cells were treated with 2 ng / ml TGF -  1 for 8 h . ChIP was per - formed using the EZ ChIP kit ( Millipore ) according to manufacturer’s pro - tocol . Protein – DNA complexes were cross - linked with 1 % formaldehyde ( 37 % stock ; Sigma - Aldrich ) for 10 min at 37°C . The reaction was termi - nated by addition of glycine ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Cells were collected in cold PBS containing protease inhibitor cocktail ( Millipore ) . After centrifugation , cell pellets were resuspended in SDS lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 1 , 10 mM EDTA , and 1 % SDS ) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail ( Millipore ) and sonicated five times for 10 s . Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation , and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and diluted 1 : 10 in ChIP dilution buffer ( 16 . 7 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 1 , 167 mM NaCl , 1 . 2 mM EDTA , 0 . 01 % SDS , and 1 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ) . Samples were precleared with protein G agarose beads for 1 h at 4°C with rotation . After brief centrifugation , the supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes . Rabbit polyclonal IgG , anti - JunB , or anti - ATF3 antibodies ( Santa Cruz Bio - technology , Inc . ) were added , and the samples were incubated at 4°C overnight with rotation followed by a 1 - h incubation with protein G aga - rose beads at 4°C with rotation . Beads were washed with 1× ChIP dilution buffer , and the cross - linking was reversed by addition of sodium chloride to a final concentration of 200 mM and incubation at 65°C for 5 h . The samples were treated with RNase A and proteinase K ( Millipore ) for 1 h at 45°C followed by purification with a spin filter column ( Millipore ) . DNA was then subjected to PCR analysis . Primer sequences used for PCR ampli - fication are listed in Tables S1 and S2 . Online supplemental material Fig .
