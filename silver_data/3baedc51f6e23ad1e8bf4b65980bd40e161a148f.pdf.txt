Mathematical models that represented how contact tracing and follow - up may control Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ) transmissions were developed for evaluating different infection control interventions , estimating likely number of infections as well as facilitating understanding of their likely epidemiology . We reviewed mathemat - icalmodelsforcontacttracingandfollow - upcontrolmeasuresofSARSandMERStransmission . Modelcharacter - istics , epidemiological parameters and intervention parameters used in the mathematical models from seven studies were summarized . A major concern identi ﬁ ed in future epidemics is whether public health administra - tors can collect all the required data for building epidemiological models in a short period of time during the early phase of an outbreak . Also , currently available models do not explicitly model constrained resources . We urge for closed - loop communication between public health administrators and modelling researchers to come up with guidelines to delineate the collection of the required data in the midst of an outbreak and the inclusion of additional logistical details in future similar models . © 2019 Published by Elsevier B .

Introduction In the21stcentury , there were threelarge - scaleoutbreaks in human populations caused by emerging coronaviruses ( Co - Vs ) : ( i ) Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) outbreak in 2003 ; ( ii ) Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ) outbreak in 2012 primarily in the Middle East Saudi Arabian Peninsula region ; and ( iii ) MERS outbreak in 2015 primarily in South Korea . Since their emergence , World Health Organization ( WHO ) had been noti ﬁ ed of more than 8000 con ﬁ rmed cases of SARS in 26 countries [ 1 ] and more than 2200 con ﬁ rmed cases of MERS in 27 countries [ 2 ] . SARSandMERSwerebothconsideredas “ fast - course ” infectiousdis - eases given their relatively short infectious period . However , overall transmission potential for MERS is lower compared to SARS [ 3 ] and its outbreaks have been contained with much lower cumulative numbers of infected individuals than was the case for SARS . Prior studies showed that human - to - human transmission of SARS occurred via close contact and respiratory droplets [ 4 ] , while that of MERS occurred via close con - tact only [ 5 ] . A large proportion of MERS cases were clustered in healthcare settings , most of which were contributed by unprotected close contact between healthcare workers and infected MERS patients . Previous studies have also highlighted the transmission heterogeneity between SARS and MERS . Higher transmission heterogeneity for MERS in the distribution of secondary cases than SARS highlighted the largest outbreak of MERS with sharper incidence peaks [ 3 ] . The majority of SARScasesoccurredamonghealthcareworkers ; whilesubstantialnum - ber of MERS cases were patients [ 3 ] , with most MERS severe cases and mortality being individuals with comorbidities [ 6 ] . On the other hand , there were similarities between the two Co - Vs . Diseases caused by them were deadly , with a mortality rate of 29 . 8 % for MERS [ 7 ] and 7 % for SARS [ 8 ] . Contact tracing , the identi ﬁ cation and follow - up of individuals who have had contacts with infectious individuals , is a critical process to en - sure the best possible chance of control and the longest possible time to local take - off [ 9 ] . Contact tracing and follow - up control measures such as quarantine and isolation were crucially important during the SARS outbreak in 2003 [ 10 ] , the Ebola outbreak in Africa in 2014 [ 11 ] , as well as its part in the eradication of smallpox [ 12 ] . With current ad - vances in vaccine development technologies , the role of contact tracing and follow - up control measures in the initial stage of an epidemic becomes especially important . For some novel pathogens such as pan - demic in ﬂ uenza , cutting - edge technology may shorten the time needed for vaccine development after initial isolation , bridging shorter gaps be - tween epidemic emergence and vaccine availability [ 13 ] . Should such improvements in vaccine development occur , the potential marginal bene ﬁ ts of improving contact tracing processes will be substantial . Mathematical models were developed to study the dynamics of SARS and MERS transmissions . Models that explicitly represented how contact tracing and follow - up control measures affected the epidemic dynamics were useful for evaluating different infection control inter - ventions , evaluating burden of infection as well as facilitating further understanding of their epidemiology . Such models have direct utility in planning for future outbreaks of coronaviruses : they can be used to estimate the scale of resources required to conduct effective contact tracing . In light of this , we conducted a systematic review of mathematical models for contact tracing and follow - up control measures of SARS and MERS transmission . The aims of this review are to ( i ) provide an overview of contact tracing and follow - up control measures of SARS and MERS transmission gained through mathematical modelling , ( ii ) to identify future research direction in this area and ( iii ) to improve future models by addressing current models ' de ﬁ ciencies . 2 . Methods To identify articles for the current study , an initial search using the PUBMED / Medline and SCOPUS databases was conducted on 27 th October 2018 using the following search terms : a . ( “ Contact Tracing ” OR “ Contact Investigation ” OR “ Contact Screen - ing ” ) AND b . ( “ model ” OR “ modelling ” OR “ modelling ” ) AND c . ( “ SARS ” OR “ MERS ” OR “ Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ” OR “ Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ” ) 2 . 1 . Article Selection Criteria Reviewers used the following selection criteria to include eligible articles : a . Transmission dynamics modelling studies of SARS or MERS in human populations ; b . Model ( s ) incorporating contact tracing interventions , case contacts ﬁ nding , quarantine , contact tracing data , population strati ﬁ cation or that used a heterogeneous contact structure ; c . Model ( s ) not explicitly discussing contact tracing and follow - up control measures were excluded . d . Articles not in English were excluded . 2 . 2 . Article Selection Two independent reviewers ( KOK , AT ) screened the titles and ab - stracts of articles obtained from the initial search and excluded articles that did not ﬁ t the selection criteria . The two reviewers then read the full text of the remaining articles , and further excluded articles that didnot ﬁ ttheselectioncriteria . Finally , referencelistsoftheincludedar - ticles were extracted , and the titles and abstracts of these articles from 187 K . O . Kwok et al . / Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal 17 ( 2019 ) 186 – 194 the reference lists were reviewed by the two reviewers based on the ar - ticle selection criteria . Articles from the extracted reference lists that ﬁ t the selection criteria were also included in the current study . The ﬂ ow diagram of the search process and the result are shown in Fig . 1 . The current systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - Analysis : The PRISMA statement [ 14 ] . 2 . 3 . Data Extraction A standard data extraction form was adopted to extract information from each article , including basic information of the article , characteris - tics of the study and parameters incorporated in the model . 3 . Results Twenty - ﬁ ve articles were identi ﬁ ed from the PUBMED / Medline da - tabase , and twenty - seven articles were identi ﬁ ed from the SCOPUS da - tabase with the initial search . Two articles from the PUBMED / Medline database and three articles from the SCOPUS database were excluded because they were not written in English . Sixteen articles were dupli - cated from the two databases , and thirty - oneunique articles were iden - ti ﬁ ed from the two databases for assessment of their abstracts using the selection criteria . Eighteen articles were excluded based on their titles and abstracts . Seven articles were further excluded after reading the full text , leaving six articles to be included in the current study . Titles and abstracts of the references of these six articles were further reviewed , and one additional article was included . Therefore , the cur - rent study included seven articles for review [ 15 – 21 ] . 3 . 1 . Characteristics of the Included Studies Among the seven included studies , four [ 15 , 17 , 19 , 21 ] presented the transmission dynamics per individual in an agent - based manner while the other three [ 16 , 18 , 20 ] modelled from the population perspective and were presented as population - based models . The models by Fraser et al . [ 19 ] and Klinkenberg et al . [ 17 ] were implemented using agent - based modelling with discrete time simulation . The model by Peak et al . [ 15 ] was an agent - based model implemented using Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered ( SEIR ) compartmental branching model . The agent - basedmodelby Becker et al . [ 21 ] wasa studywith household structure . The population - based model by Lloyd - Smith et al . [ 20 ] and Feng et al . [ 16 ] were implemented using SEIR compartmental model . Chen et al . [ 18 ] used Foerster equation - based to describe thepopulation dynamics . Seven included studies used either ( i ) population - based modelling , and ( ii ) agent - based modelling . Population - based modelling is a top - down approach depicting disease dynamics on a system level . Agent - based modelling is a bottom - up approach regarding each individual in the environment as an agent with their own movements and infection states . Population - based models are typically used for analyzing re - search questions from macroscopic perspectives , whereas agent - based models are good for analyzing microscopic behaviors . Agent - based ap - proach is commonly used to implement heterogeneous and adaptive behaviors . Population - based models are usually less computationally demanding comparing with agent - based models , especially when the number of parameters incorporated in the model is large . All reviewed studies presented models using SARS as the study ex - ample of Co - V ; one also presented model studying MERS [ 15 ] . Six stud - ies simulated community setting in the models [ 15 – 17 , 19 – 21 ] ; three studies simulated hospital setting in their models [ 16 , 18 , 20 ] . Six studies 25 records identified from PUBMED / Medline 27 records identified from SCOPUS 2 non - English articles were excluded 3 non - English articles were excluded 10 articles were excluded 7 articles were excluded 147 articles were identified from the references of the 6 articles Titles and abstracts of 147 articles were assessed using the selection criteria 146 articles were excluded Abstracts of 31 unique articles were assessed using the selection criteria Full text of 13 articles were assessed using the selection criteria 6 articles were included in the review 1 article were included in the review 7 articles were included in the review totally Fig . 1 . Flow diagram of the selection process . 188 K . O . Kwok et al . / Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal 17 ( 2019 ) 186 – 194 assumed homogeneous mixing in the social contact structure [ 15 – 20 ] : the assumption that everyone in the population had the same probabil - ity of making social contact with others . One study assumed heteroge - neous social contact mixing between school attendees and non - school attendees [ 21 ] . All studies considered single - step tracing of contacts di - rectly exposed to the infectious individuals . One study also considered interactive tracing of contacts directly and indirectly exposed to the in - fectious individuals [ 17 ] . Characteristics of the seven included studies are summarized in Table 1 . 3 . 2 . Key Input Epidemiological Parameters There was considerable variation in the assumptions made about key epidemiological parameters : the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) , incubationperiod , latentperiodandinfectiousperiod . Keyepidemiolog - ical parameters used in the seven included studies are summarized in Table 2 . 3 . 2 . 1 . Basic Reproduction Number ( R 0 ) R 0 is the average number of secondary cases caused by one typically infectious individual of an epidemic in a wholly susceptible population [ 22 ] . R 0 used by transmission models were usually estimated based on clinical data , and they varied by the dataset used . The values of R 0 for SARS used by the seven included studies ranged from 0 . 25 to 6 ; and the value of R 0 for MERS used by Peak et al . was 0 . 95 [ 15 ] . 3 . 2 . 2 . Incubation Period and Latent Period Incubation period refers tothetime elapsed between pathogenic ex - posures to symptom onset [ 23 ] whereas latent period is the time elapsed between pathogenic exposures to being infectious [ 24 ] . Fig . 2 il - lustrates these two periods in the natural history of a disease course , where symptom onset can occur before or after being infectious . Six studies incorporated incubation period in the models . They character - ized theincubation period with three different parametric distributions . Lloyd - Smith et al . , Fraser et al . , Feng et al . and Klinkenberg et al . assumed gamma distribution [ 16 , 17 , 19 , 20 ] . Chen et al . assumed expo - nentialdistribution [ 18 ] . Peaketal . didnotassumeanydistribution [ 15 ] . Three studies incorporated latent period in their models [ 15 , 17 , 21 ] . Klinkenberg et al . de ﬁ ned latent period relative to detection time by subtracting latent period from the sum of the incubation period and the time lapse from symptom onset to isolation [ 17 ] . Becker et al . assumed that symptom onsets occurred prior to infection , and used in - cubation period from previous literatures as latent period [ 21 ] . Peak et al . did not incorporate latent period as a parameter ; the latent period offsetwasintroduced asaparameter to measurethetimingof thelatent period relative to the incubation period [ 15 ] . InourtwostudyCo - Vs , SARShadaslightlyshorterincubationperiod than latent period [ 15 , 17 ] . However , a longer incubation period than la - tent period was observed in MERS with occurrence of symptom onset after being infectious as presented as positive latent period offset in the model by Peak et al . [ 15 ] . 3 . 2 . 3 . Infectious Period The infectious period is the time interval during which the infected individuals could transmit the disease to any susceptible contacts ( Fig . 2 ) Lloyd - Smithetal . , Fraseretal . andFengetal . [ 16 , 19 , 20 ] assumed gamma - distributed infectious period , while Chen et al . [ 18 ] assumed exponentially - distributed infectious period . Peak et al . [ 15 ] assumed a triangular distribution using peak infectiousness as a parameter of the distribution . Klinkenberg et al . and Becker et al . [ 17 , 21 ] used a similar term called “ effective infectious period ” , de ﬁ ned as the time lapse from being infectious to isolation Klinkenberg et al . [ 17 ] and Becker et al . [ 21 ] both assumed a constant effective infectious period adopted from previous literature and WHO data respectively . 3 . 3 . Intervention Parameters The process of contact tracing sits on top of the transmission model and is governed by its own parameters within these models .

Medical consultation seeking rate and diagnosis probability were combined . 2 . Quarantined individuals were assumed to spend half of their incubation period at large . The study focused on early stage of the outbreak . 189 K . O . Kwok et al . / Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal 17 ( 2019 ) 186 – 194 Intervention parameters used in the seven reviewed studies are sum - marized in Table 3 . 3 . 3 . 1 . Successful Tracing Ratio of Contacts Contacts who are successfully traced will be handled through subse - quent follow - up actions such as symptom monitoring or isolation . In practical epidemiological cases , not all contacts can be successfully traced . Four studies includedthefactorof successfultracingratio ofcon - tacts in their dynamics models . Peak et al . [ 15 ] and Klinkenberg et al . [ 17 ] explicitly incorporated a component for proportion of identi ﬁ ed contacts in their models . Identi ﬁ ed contacts were quarantined before development of symptoms . Slightly different populations targeted for quarantine were identi ﬁ ed in our review studies . Becker et al . [ 21 ] targeted all household members and a proportion of 50 % of between household contact of an infected individual . Contact tracing ef ﬁ cacy wasde ﬁ nedbyChenetal . [ 18 ] tore ﬂ ectthisratio . Ingeneral , quarantine of all identi ﬁ ed contacts of diagnosed infected individuals was featured in all individual - based infection dynamics models . Ideally , identi ﬁ ed contacts are subsequently isolated for management immediately after they have been identi ﬁ ed through regular symptom monitor assess - ment as symptomatic individuals . Peak et al . further considered the fractions of traced contacts who were truly infected and de ﬁ ned unin - fected contacts to be traced for a duration up to 95th percentile of incu - bation period . 3 . 3 . 2 . Asymptomatic Transmission Ratio Asymptomatic transmission ratio refers to the proportion of infec - tions that have occurred before symptom onset . Prior research showed that a signi ﬁ cant amount of SARS Co - V transmissions were either pre - symptomatic or asymptomatic [ 25 ] . As of 18 August 2018 , there has been no con ﬁ rmed case caused by asymptomatic transmission for MERS , with one possible case of asymptomatic transmission occurred during the 2012 outbreak [ 26 ] . Four studies [ 15 , 18 – 20 ] considered this factor in their transmission models and a range of estimates from 0 to 11 % were used . Feng et al . did not explicitly include this parameter in the model , but re ﬂ ected the occurrence of asymptomatic transmis - sion in infection rates contributed by exposed individuals . The study for MERS by Peak et al . assumed no asymptomatic infection [ 15 ] . 3 . 3 . 3 . Quarantine and Isolation Delay Inpracticalepidemiologicalcases , follow - upcontrolmeasuresmight not be implemented to contacts and infected individuals immediately after the contact event . In the 2003 SARS outbreak , it was observed that the time between symptoms onset and hospitalization was 3 – 5 days , with longer times earlier in the epidemic [ 27 ] . Two kinds of implementation delay were considered in the reviewed studies : quar - antine delay and isolation delay . Quarantine delay refers to the time lapse between the identi ﬁ cation of infected individuals and the imple - mentation of quarantine to contacts . Isolation delay refers to the time lapse between symptoms onset and formal hospital diagnosis / isolation of the infected individuals . Across the seven studies , ﬁ ve considered the effect of quarantine delay in the transmission dynamics using similar quantities . Peak et al . [ 15 ] speci ﬁ ed a term called “ delay in tracing a named contact ” . Fraser et al . [ 19 ] used a term called “ quarantine ef ﬁ cacy ” . Lloyd Smith et al . [ 20 ] used a term called “ probability of quarantining incubating individ - uals in community ” . Chen et al . [ 18 ] used a term called “ contact tracing ef ﬁ cacy ” . Fengetal . [ 16 ] featuredthisdelaywithaprogressionratefrom exposed state ( either identi ﬁ ed or unidenti ﬁ ed contacts ) to prodrome in the compartmental model . Three studies characterized isolation delay in the model . Klinkenberg et al . de ﬁ ned a ﬁ xed value of 3 . 67 days between symptom onset and iso - lation [ 17 ] . Peak et al . [ 15 ] de ﬁ ned a variable value of 0 – 0 . 5 days for iso - lation delay , and also supplemented a uniform distributed delay from onset to health seeking behavior . Fraser et al . [ 19 ] de ﬁ ned a distribution characterizing an individual person who had not been isolated by the time since infection to re ﬂ ect isolation delay . Other three studies did not include an explicit term for isolation delay , but re ﬂ ected it in terms of other embedded quantities . Lloyd - Smith et al . [ 20 ] embedded a prob - ability of isolating symptomatic individuals in the community and Table 2 Summary of key epidemiological parameters used in the reviewed studies . Author Lloyd Smith et al .

Kwok et al . / Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal 17 ( 2019 ) 186 – 194 healthcare workers in their model . Feng et al . [ 16 ] re ﬂ ected isolation delay with a progression rate of prodromal individuals becoming acute illness in the disease dynamics . Becker et al . [ 21 ] accounted for isolation delay with a revised proportion of the infectious period that had passed at the time the infected individuals were isolated . Chen et al . [ 18 ] did not consider the factor of isolation delay in their model . 3 . 3 . 4 . Quarantine and Isolation Ef ﬁ ciency Contact tracing is shown to be an essential and successful public health tool inreducingthetransmission riskof newemerginginfectious diseases such as SARS among Hong Kong population [ 10 ] . However , the follow - upquarantineandisolation did not necessarily stop alltransmis - sion , as illustrated in nosocomial outbreaks of SARS [ 28 ] and MERS [ 29 ] . An ef ﬁ ciency factor is therefore sometimes incorporated in the models in order to represent the overall quarantine and isolation ef ﬁ ciency in transmission control . Four studies incorporated quarantine ef ﬁ ciency in their models . Quarantine ef ﬁ cacy [ 19 ] , probability of quarantining in - dividuals in the community [ 20 ] , a smaller hospitalization rate per capita of the exposed individuals [ 16 ] and contact tracing ef ﬁ cacy [ 18 ] were used to account for quarantine ef ﬁ ciency . Becker et al . [ 21 ] , Klinkenberg et al . [ 17 ] , and Peak et al . [ 15 ] did not incorporate quaran - tine ef ﬁ ciency as a factor of their model , and assuming 100 % in quaran - tine ef ﬁ ciency . Four studies incorporated isolation ef ﬁ ciency as a factor in the models . Peak et al . [ 15 ] used a term named “ isolation effectiveness ” to represent isolation ef ﬁ ciency in their model . Lloyd - Smith et al . [ 20 ] re ﬂ ected isolation ef ﬁ ciency with two terms , “ probability of isolation of symptomatic individuals in the community ” and “ probabilityof isola - tion of symptomatic healthcare workers ” .

Fraseretal . [ 19 ] usedtwoterms , “ isolation ef ﬁ cacy ” and “ contact tracing ef ﬁ ciency ” , to measure effectiveness of isolation for infected individuals and effectiveness of isolation for con - tacts respectively . Becker et al . [ 21 ] , Chen et al . [ 18 ] and Klinkenberg et al .

Correlation Structure between Disease Generation Induced by Con - tact Tracing Social contact structure between disease generations is affected by contact tracing and follow - up measures . Social contact is expected to be reduced when an individual is successfully traced . Out of the seven studies , only Peak et al . [ 15 ] considered this correlation structure be - tween disease generation due to contact tracing in the model . 3 . 4 . Implications of Quarantine for Controlling SARS and MERS Quarantine is usually considered as one of the live options during disease outbreaks . Day et al . proposed a criteria for quarantine to be ef - fective if a large number of infections were contributed by asymptom - atic infection [ 30 ] . However , given the social disruption and high costs of this control measure , its poor scalability and resource constraint resulting implementation delay reduce immensely its effectiveness for epidemic containment . For SARS , Feng et al . noted that “ ﬁ nal outbreak size would have been smaller if greater proportion of exposed individuals being quarantined in theory but quarantine is exceedingly inef ﬁ cient ” [ 16 ] . Fraser et al . concluded that “ effective isolation of symptomatic indi - viduals is suf ﬁ cient to control an outbreak for SARS ” [ 19 ] . Chen et al . con - cluded that “ effective isolation of symptomatic patients with low ef ﬁ cacy contact tracing is suf ﬁ cient to control of SARS outbreak ” [ 18 ] . Peak et al . [ 15 ] found that “ comparative effectiveness of quarantine and symptom monitoring is strongly in ﬂ uenced by differences in the infection ' s natural history ” . With other intervention strategies in force , marginal bene ﬁ t of quarantine wasshowntobeusuallyverylow for SARS [ 15 ] . Combina - tion of symptom monitoring with other complementary interventions , such as hand - hygiene , social distancing and protective equipment or simply isolating infected individuals only , likely controlled the diseases and ruled out the need to resort to quarantine [ 15 , 19 ] . For MERS , the possible substantial increase in its transmissibility resulted in dif ﬁ culty in using symptom monitoring to control the disease which guaranteed the reassessment of the role of quarantine [ 15 ] . 4 . Discussion Mathematical modelling has been a powerful tool for understanding and predicting the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases . It was particularly useful during ongoing outbreaks , and was used for evaluat - ing public health policies for disease containment in the SARS outbreak [ 10 ] , predicting transmission progression , testing ef ﬁ cacy and evaluat - ing effectiveness of contact tracing during the Ebola outbreak in 2013 [ 31 , 32 ] . Improvements for future work and future research directions are summarized from the reviewed models . 4 . 1 . Parameterization in Epidemiological Models Tables 2 and 3 summarize the major parameters incorporated in the seven reviewed models . The two tables list eleven parameters ( four key epidemiological parameters and seven intervention parameters ) . A pri - mary consideration in the initial stage of constructing mathematical ep - idemiology models is what parameters to be included in a model . The moststraightforwardapproachistoincludeasmanyparametersaspos - sible to re ﬂ ectdisease natural history , practical intervention and control measures . A more generic and complex model incorporating all major parameters provides the ﬂ exibility of manipulating different variables to simulate outcomes under various hypothetical scenarios . However , from a practical point of view , modelers should consider whether pa - rameters featuring disease courses and interventions can be estimated from empirical or clinical data . The availability of data for parameter es - timation is the central challenge for building realistic models . Arobustandrapidestimationofparametersduringtheearlystageof a Co \ \ V outbreak is essential for the construction of useful models of contact tracing . When designing a mathematical epidemiology model , modelers need to ascertain what data can be collected by public health administrators , practically during an outbreak . It was not clear to us from the reports considered in this review that this was yet common practice . We recommend closed - loop communication between epide - miologists and public health administrators for assessing clinical and empirical datacollection process duringthe initialphase of anoutbreak . During that period , public health administrators should also prepare a set of operation guidelines for collecting required data . There was considerable variation in the choice of distributions used for key elements of the natural history . Exponential distributed incuba - tion and infectious period were normally used to ensure greater math - ematical tractability . However , some studies proposed to adopt gamma distributioninsteadtobetterdescribethediseasestagesofSARS [ 27 , 33 ] . Pitzer et al . [ 34 ] suggested that models with gamma distributed infec - tious period were best ﬁ t to the data compared with those assuming constant transmission probability or proportional relation with viral load . The nature of memory - less free characteristics of gamma distribu - tionensuredthebiologyinthetransmissionprocesstobemorerealistic . Previous work [ 35 – 37 ] suggested the importance of realistic distribu - tion of these quantities facilitated more understanding in the epidemic size , the disease progression and how their distributions be adjusted in response to different intervention strategies [ 38 ] . These choices are especially relevant to models of contact tracing , as was evident in the early 2000s when two apparently similar models [ 39 , 40 ] came to very different conclusions about likely ef ﬁ cacy of contact tracing because of their different implicit assumptions about the variance of the latent pe - riod distribution . 4 . 2 . Social Contact Mixing Assumptions Onecommonassumptionamongthereviewedstudieswashomoge - neity in social contact mixing . Six reviewed studies assumed homoge - neous social contact mixing [ 15 – 20 ] . This assumption was not re ﬂ ecting realistic situations . Previous study found that social contact patterns was heterogeneous [ 41 , 42 ] , and social contact pattern within age groups was a signi ﬁ cant factor of age - speci ﬁ c infection rates [ 42 ] . Future models should consider contact patterns in different social set - tings such as home , workplace , school , hospital and community to re - ﬂ ect the heterogeneity in disease transmissibility . Another common assumption among the reviewed studies was as - suming social contact mixing to be the same before and after control measures were implemented . Six studies made such assumption [ 16 – 21 ] . Fraser et al . [ 19 ] addressed this issue by pointing out this mis - assumption as a limitation of their model , and suggested that models incorporate this feature or alternative mechanisms [ 9 , 43 ] with hetero - geneity transmission would give a more unbiased ef ﬁ cacy estimate of contact tracing . Peak et al . addressed this limitation by incorporating this factor into their model [ 15 ] . The correlation structure between in - fectious individuals and infected individuals for subsequent interven - tion measures following contact tracing should be considered . 4 . 3 . Resource Constraints All studies assumed that contact tracing and follow - up control mea - sures were conducted with unlimited resources . None considered the practical constraints that resources for contact tracing and follow - up control measures might not be available at full throttle . Previous out - break demonstrated that it was not feasible to have all identi ﬁ ed con - tacts traced as the workforce for contact tracing were depleted in particular for top - stretched resources during the early phase of out - breaks . Public health administrators were faced with decisions and trade - offs in various resources allocation and effort prioritization along with political and social resistance . Future research questions need addressing are how many resources are required and how to pri - oritize the resources to contain the diseases . 192 K . O . Kwok et al . / Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal 17 ( 2019 ) 186 – 194 5 . Summary and Outlook No one - size guideline is available for containment of both SARS and MERS or other emerging coronavirus . However , mathematical models can help inform policy makers by evaluating the effectiveness of differ - ent existing intervention approaches in the early phase of epidemics of new emerging and reemerging Co - V outbreak in the future . A recent con ﬁ rmed case of MERS in Seoul in September 2018 [ 44 ] sparked the imminent call for epidemic counter measures preparedness . To devise appropriate decision tools for the challenges of Co - V , there are a few highlights to re ﬁ ne the models in future research . First , understanding the epidemiology of the disease will be the top priority in response preparedness . It is key to ensure that proper data can be obtained for model construction during the early stage of anout - break . To address this concern , public health authority should work closely with other government departments to work out accurate epi - demiology data . Modelling researchers should also liaise with public health authority to ensure the required data can be obtained . Second , to re ﬂ ect the real situation , future modelling studies should evaluate in - tervention tools under resource - constrained situations and how to allo - cate resources at different epidemic stages . Third , although SARS and MERSarebothclassi ﬁ edascoronavirus , thetransmissionheterogeneity , differences in relative exposure patterns [ 3 ] and practicability of control measures determine the optimal solutions for their containment . Geo - graphic disparity of Ro estimate for SARS in 2003 due to different dis - ease and community dependent transmission rate [ 45 ] highlighted the need for different levels of contact tracing approach during the epi - demics . Forth , both hospital and community setting with the super - spreading events should be included in the transmission dynamics of Co - V outbreak to characterize the role of contact tracing in curbing the escalation of number of infections contributed by super - spreaders . Fifth , modellingapproachcan provide thecondition that contact tracing effectively control the outbreak . Sometimes , politicians or health policy makers may hesitate to implement contact tracing . For example , SARS transmission in high - rise buildings among residents of Amoy Gardens suggested possible airborne transmission [ 46 , 47 ] and government of ﬁ - cials were prone to political pressures regarding quarantine . With the help of mathematical models , they can decide when to adopt contact tracingif certainconditionsaresatis ﬁ ed . Lastbutnot least , model devel - opers should incorporate factors regarding pre - symptomatic transmis - sion and limited resources allocation against the epidemics at the beginning of the outbreak . Resources optimization and quarantine pri - oritization by target population will be the next step epidemiologists or modelers should focus on for the challenges of new emerging Co - V epidemics in the future . Two typical examples of the re ﬁ nement of the current quarantine approach are household quarantine and quarantine based on residential geographic location . In addition to restricting movement in a particular geographic region and recommendation of infectious household members to stay home , other tracing approaches including identifying contacts at workplace or school can also be considered .
