Thus , the Diamond Princess cruise ship , which was quarantined because of an onboard outbreak of COVID - 19 in February , 2020 , provides an opportunity to define the shedding pattern of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) and patient antibody responses before and after the onset of symptoms . Methods We recruited adult ( ≥18 years ) passengers from Hong Kong who had been on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Yokohama , Japan in February , 2020 . All participants had been found to be negative for SARS - CoV - 2 by RT - PCR 4 days before disembarking and were transferred to further quarantine in a public estate in Hong Kong , where they were recruited . Participants were prospectively screened by quantitative RT - PCR ( RT - qPCR ) of nasopharyngeal and throat swabs , and serum IgG and IgM against internal nucleoprotein and the surface spike receptor - binding protein ( RBD ) of SARS - CoV - 2 at baseline ( upon entering quarantine ) and on days 4 , 8 , and 12 of quarantine . Findings On Feb 22 , 2020 , 215 adults were recruited , of whom nine ( 4 % ; 95 % CI 2 – 8 ) were positive for SARS - CoV - 2 by RT - qPCR or serology and were hospitalised . Of these nine patients , nasopharyngeal swab RT - qPCR was positive in eight patients ( 89 % ; 57 – 99 ) at baseline . All nine patients were positive for anti - RBD IgG by day 8 . Eight ( 89 % ; 57 – 99 ) were simultaneously positive for nasopharyngeal swab RT - PCR and anti - RBD IgG . One patient who was positive for anti - RBD IgG and had a negative viral load had multifocal peripheral ground - glass changes on high - resolution CT that were typical of COVID - 19 . Five patients ( 56 % ; 27 – 81 ) with ground - glass changes on high - resolution CT were found to have higher anti - nucleoprotein - IgG OD values on day 8 and 12 and anti - RBD IgG OD value on day 12 than patients without ground - glass changes . Six ( 67 % ; 35 – 88 ) patients remained asymptomatic throughout the 14 - day quarantine period . Interpretation Patients with COVID - 19 can develop asymptomatic lung infection with viral shedding and those with evidence of pneumonia on imaging tend to have an increased antibody response . Positive IgG or IgM confirmed infection of COVID - 19 in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients . A combination of RT - PCR and serology should be implemented for case finding and contact tracing to facilitate early diagnosis , prompt isolation , and treatment .

Introduction A modern cruise ship is like a travelling city , with a common food and water supply , shared sanitation and air - conditioning systems , and a large population confined together . 1 The individuals are often from a middle - to - upper social class , with different cultures , immunisation backgrounds , and health statuses . The proximity of passen gers and crew members in a semi - enclosed environ ment , with interactions in the dining halls , recreational rooms , spas , and pools , creates a unique environment for the person - to - person transmission of microbes . Contamination of commonly shared and frequently touched surfaces , food , or water supply or sanitation systems can occur and can cause considerable morbidity and mortality . Cruise passengers tend to be older people , with the 60 – 69 - year - old group accounting for the majority , 2 who are more likely to have underlying chronic medical comorbidities and thus be more Articles 2 www . thelancet . com / infection Published online June 12 , 2020 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / S1473 - 3099 ( 20 ) 30364 - 9 Correspondence to : Prof Kwok - Yung Yuen , State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases , Carol Yu Centre for Infection , University of Hong Kong , Hong Kong Special Administrative Region , China kyyuen @ hku . hk susceptible to infection and associated complications than the general population . Common reported out breaks on cruise ships have included respiratory infections with influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 , Legionnaires’ disease , and acute gastroenteritis due to norovirus . 1 , 3 – 6 Since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) in December , 2019 , the virus has caused a pandemic affecting more than 4·7 million people , with more than 300 000 deaths in 229 countries . 7 – 10 On Jan 20 , 2020 , an 80 - year - old man from Hong Kong boarded the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama , Japan , and disembarked in Hong Kong on Jan 25 , 2020 ( figure 1 ) . On Feb 1 , 2020 , he was hospitalised with fever and tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 . The cruise continued to Vietnam and Taiwan , then returned to Yokohama , at which time ten passengers were diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) , 11 and a 14 - day quarantine order was imposed for all passengers and crew on board . Between Feb 5 , and Feb 17 , 2020 , the Japanese Health Ministry tested all passengers by throat swab RT - PCR ; individuals who tested positive were isolated in local hospitals . Individuals who tested negative were kept on board confined to their cabins and were only allowed out of the cabin for 1 h per day to exercise . The ship remained docked in the Port of Yokohama . By Feb 17 , countries were allowed to air - evacuate citizens back to their home nations . Therefore , the Hong Kong Government chartered two flights on Feb 20 and Feb 21 to transfer passengers who had tested negative to Hong Kong for a further 14 days of quarantine in a newly completed public estate . As of May 14 , 2020 , 712 ( 19 % ) of the 3711 passengers and crew had been infected with SARS - CoV - 2 , and 13 deaths had occurred among those with confirmed infection . 12 We investigated the sequential SARS - CoV - 2 shedding and the specific antibody response in this cohort of passengers quarantined in Hong Kong . Methods Study design and participants Hong Kong citizens were air - evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship on Feb 20 and Feb 21 , 2020 , and entered quarantine in the Chun Yeung estate , a newly built and vacant public estate in Hong Kong , on Feb 22 . Each unit had a bathroom and kitchen and housed one to two people . During the 14 - day quarantine period , they were placed in complete isolation . Only health - care workers from the Hong Kong Department of Health would visit daily to do health checks and to deliver meals . Family visits and contact with the general public were not allowed and individuals were asked to handle their own laundry . With approval by the Department of Health , we visited and collected samples from the individuals together with the aforementioned health workers . All adult passengers aged 18 years and older were screened and given the choice to join the study . There were no exclusion criteria . All participants provided written informed consent and could withdraw from the study at any point . The Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong and Hospital Authority approved this study . Procedures Participants were screened by quantitative RT - PCR ( RT - qPCR ) for SARS - CoV - 2 in nasopharyngeal , throat , and rectal swabs at baseline ( Feb 22 , 2020 ) , day 4 , day 8 , and day 12 , and tested for serum IgG and IgM against both internal nucleoprotein and the surface spike receptor - binding protein ( RBD ) of SARS - CoV - 2 , at baseline , day 4 , day 8 , and day 12 . The following participant data were entered into a database : name , Hong Kong personal identification number , age , sex , medical history by completion of a questionnaire , presenting symptoms and signs , and laboratory , radiological , virological , and serological Research in context Evidence before this study We searched PubMed on March 14 , 2020 , with no date restrictions , for articles in English , using the terms “Covid - 19” , “coronavirus” , “antibody” , “viral load” , “cruise ship” , “quarantine” , “shedding” , and “seroconversion” . Our search did not identify any reports on the prospective follow - up of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) viral shedding and seroconversion in a cruise ship setting . We identified one case report on the clinical presentation of two individuals on the Diamond Princess cruise ship , and an article estimating the effectiveness of public health measures on controlling the COVID - 19 epidemic potential on a cruise ship . Added value of this study To our knowledge , this is the first cruise ship study of the clinical evolution and seroconversion from coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) from last possible exposure to the pathogen to the end of the suspected incubation period . The study showed that asymptomatic individuals might seroconvert while carrying a high viral load and continue to shed the virus . Patients who had viral pneumonitis detected by high - resolution CT tended to have a higher antibody response . High - resolution CT also helped to establish a clinical diagnosis and detect cases of asymptomatic lung infection . Implications of all the available evidence Asymptomatic COVID - 19 infection with continuous viral shedding makes infection control difficult . Therefore , a combination of RT - PCR and serology should be implemented for case finding and contact tracing in a community outbreak of COVID - 19 to facilitate early diagnosis , prompt isolation , and treatment . High - resolution CT could also help to detect cases of asymptomatic infection .

Participants who developed symptoms or who were found to have virological or serological evidence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection at the time of screening were admitted to the Queen Mary Hospital or the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Hong Kong for further investi - gation and treatment . All hospitalised participants under went chest radiograph and high - resolution CT examination . Nucleic acid extraction and RT - qPCR were done as previously reported . 13 Enzyme immunoassays for nucleoprotein and RBD and optical density ( OD ) cutoff values at 450 nm and 620 nm were established as previously described . 14 The cutoff value for positivity was based on the mean value plus 3 SDs of the negative control , using archived serum specimens collected in 2018 from 93 anonymous individuals without SARS - CoV - 2 infection . 14 Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics are presented . Findings of the participants who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 are presented as a case series . All data were analysed with SPSS ( version 26 . 0 ) .

The three children were excluded from the study because their clinical data were not available for assessment . Ten passengers declined to join the study and remained well until discharge . Thus , 215 adult participants were enrolled . Baseline charac teristics of participants who tested positive ( n = 9 ) and negative ( n = 206 ) for SARS - CoV - 2 were well matched ( table 1 ) . Nine ( 4 % ; 95 % CI 2 – 8 ) of 215 participants were found to have evidence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection and were hospitalised . These nine individuals were not related to each other ; they boarded the ship in Hong Kong on Jan 25 , 2020 , when the index passenger had already disembarked and therefore had no contact with him ( figure 1 ) . At the last onboard COVID - 19 testing by throat swab on Feb 17 , 2020 , all nine individuals tested negative . Both parents and the grandfather of patient 7 had tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 at the initial governmental screen in Japan . They were subsequently discharged from hospital in Japan after testing negative , and they returned to Hong Kong in March , 2020 . We have ordered the nine patients who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 in the probable order of infection , according to their viral load and serological profile ( table 2 , figure 2A ) . Six ( 67 % ; 95 % CI 35 – 88 ) patients remained asymptomatic ( table 2 ) . Patient 7 and patient 8 had had transient fever on Feb 15 ( day – 7 ) and Feb 20 ( day – 2 ) , while still on board the cruise ship , but had not reached convalescence by the time of enrolment .

Of the three patients who had fever , one patient had concomitant symptoms of malaise and rhinorrhoea , one patient had an unproductive cough , and one had rhinorrhoea only ( table 2 ) . Comparison of the asymptomatic patients ( n = 6 ) with the symptomatic patients ( n = 3 ) showed that the asymptomatic patients were younger ( median age 57 years [ IQR 47 – 59 ] vs 68 years [ 59 – 68 ] ) , had a higher baseline nasopharyngeal viral load ( 7·62 log 10 copies / mL [ 4·31 – 8·43 ] vs 4·66 log 10 copies / mL [ 2·70 – 5·29 ] ) , and were more likely to be positive for anti - nucleoprotein IgG at baseline ( four [ 67 % ] patients vs none ) . Three ( 33 % ; 95 % CI 12 – 65 ) of the nine patients with SARS - CoV - 2 were men , and six ( 67 % ; 35 – 88 ) had underlying diseases , including hypertension , ischaemic heart disease , diabetes , hyperlipidaemia , old pulmonary tuberculosis , and non - toxic multinodular goitre . The median age was 58 years ( IQR 57 – 65 ) . The median ( IQR ) laboratory findings were : haemoglobin 12·5 g / dL ( 12·0 – 13·6 ) , white cell count 6·49 × 10⁹ per L ( 5·82 – 7·20 ) , neutrophil count 4·84 × 10⁹ per L ( 3·18 – 5·39 ) , lymphocyte count 1·48 × 10⁹ per L ( 1·44 – 1·84 ) , C - reactive protein 0·35 mg / dL ( 0·35 – 2·33 ) , alanine aminotransferase 24 U / L ( 20 – 40 ) , lactate dehydrogenase 225 U / L ( 166 – 236 ) , creatinine 59 µmol / L ( 51 – 94 ) , urea 3·4 mmol / L ( 2·8 – 4·9 ) , and creatine kinase 92 U / L ( 54 – 166 ) . Patient 5 had anaemia due to menorrhagia . Patient 1 was the only patient with undetectable viral load on presentation ( table 2 ) , despite having a positive serological profile ( figure 2A ) and pulmonary changes on high - resolution CT ( figure 3A ) that suggested recent COVID - 19 . The other eight patients ( 89 % ; 95 % CI 57 – 99 ) were positive on nasopharyngeal swab RT - PCR for SARS - CoV - 2 at baseline . Patients 6 and 7 had transient detectable viral load at baseline , and patients 3 and 4 had transient detectable viral load on baseline and day 4 . Patients 5 , 8 , and 9 had persistent detectable nasopharyngeal viral load through to day 12 . Positive viral load could precede the onset of symptoms , as evidenced by patient 9 . The median nasopharyngeal viral load at baseline was 4·31 log 10 copies per mL ( IQR 3·79 – 6·65 ) , on day 4 was 2·87 log 10 copies per mL ( 2·70 – 4·95 ) , on day 8 was 2·84 log 10 copies per mL ( 2·70 – 4·61 ) , and on day 12 was 2·7 log 10 copies per mL ( 2·70 – 3·44 ) . Three patients ( 33 % ; 95 % CI 12 – 65 ) were found to be positive for SARS - CoV - 2 on throat swab RT - qPCR ( table 2 ) . The median throat swab viral load at baseline was 2·70 log 10 copies per mL ( IQR 2·70 – 5·50 ) and at day 4 was 2·70 log 10 copies per mL ( 2·70 – 3·66 ) . The viral loads in the throat swabs were lower than those in the nasopharyngeal swabs at the same timepoints . Rectal swab viral load was negative in all nine patients . The nasopharyngeal SARS - CoV - 2 RT - qPCR median viral load was higher in symptomatic patients than in asymptomatic patients ( 7·62 log 10 copies per mL vs 3·86 log 10 copies per mL ) . Chest radiographs showed changes consistent with interstitial pneumonia in four patients ( 44 % ; 95 % CI 19 – 73 ) , with right lower lobe changes in patient 2 , right middle lobe changes in patient 6 , left lower lobe changes in patient 7 , and right lower lobe changes in patient 9 ( table 2 , figure 3 ) . Chest radiographs were normal in four patients ( 44 % ; 95 % CI 19 – 73 ) and patient 4 had old granuloma from previous pulmonary tuberculosis . High - resolution CT ( table 2 , figure 3 ) showed ground - glass changes typical of COVID - 19 in five patients ( 56 % ; 95 % CI 27 – 81 ) : patients 1 and 9 had right lower lobe ground - glass changes , patient 2 had right upper and lower lobe changes , patient 6 had right middle lobe changes , and patient 7 had left upper and lower lobe changes . Patients 3 , 5 , and 8 had normal chest radiograph and CT results , but tested positive on nasopharyngeal swab RT - PCR ( table 2 ) . Patients 3 and 5 were asymp tomatic , whereas patient 8 developed fever and rhinorrhoea on day – 2 . Three patients ( patients 1 , 2 , and 6 ) had pulmonary CT changes but were asymptomatic . All nine patients were found to be positive for anti - RBD IgG ( 100 % seroconversion ) on days 8 and 12 ( table 2 ) .

Anti - nucleoprotein IgM and anti - RBD IgM were positive in three patients ( 33 % ; 95 % CI 12 – 65 ) . Patient 9 was the only patient who seroconverted for both anti - nucleoprotein and anti - RBD IgG on day 8 , while remaining positive for nasopharyngeal and throat swab viral load . The IgM / IgG ratios for anti - nucleoprotein and anti - RBD are shown in table 2 . All ratios were less than 1 , suggesting that IgG was higher than IgM at all four timepoints and that the serological response for IgG was probably more robust than for IgM . No obvious pattern could be found to suggest the timing of infection . The number of patients with positive anti - nucleoprotein IgG increased , with a corresponding decrease in positive nasopharyngeal swab RT - qPCR over the 12 days ( figure 2 ) . The five patients with high - resolution CT ground - glass changes suggestive of pneumonitis were found to have higher median anti - nucleoprotein IgG ( OD 2·02 [ IQR 1·81 – 2·38 ] vs 0·48 [ 0·21 – 0·85 ] on day 8 ; 2·06 [ 1·79 – 2·75 ] vs 0·47 [ 0·21 – 0·91 ] on day 12 ) and higher median anti - RBD ( 1·06 [ 0·76 – 1·16 ] vs 0·42 [ 0·26 – 0·55 ] on day 12 ) than the four patients without high - resolution CT changes . Discussion To our knowledge , this is the first study that investigates the real - time progression of a group of individuals who were initially negative for SARS - CoV - 2 on RT - PCR after exposure to an outbreak of COVID - 19 on a cruise ship . Nine individuals later tested positive on RT - PCR from nasopharyngeal swab , had high - resolution CT changes , or showed seroconversion , and were thus found to be infected with SARS - CoV - 2 . Despite the positive clinical Figure 3 : Chest radiographs and high - resolution CT images of patients ( A ) Patient 1 . ( B ) Patient 2 . ( C ) Patient 6 . ( D ) Patient 7 . ( E ) Patient 9 .

A C D E B F Articles 8 www . thelancet . com / infection Published online June 12 , 2020 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / S1473 - 3099 ( 20 ) 30364 - 9 findings , six of the nine patients remained asymptomatic throughout the 14 - day quarantine after leaving the ship ( ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic patients 1 : 2 ) . If the cruise ship epidemic is a microcosm of the community outbreak scenario , then individuals with or without pneumonia could carry the virus for a long period but remain asymptomatic . 8 , 9 Asymptomatic patients with few or no comorbidities could spread the disease , whereas symptomatic patients represent only a small , but visible , proportion of total cases . 15 This finding is particularly important in densely populated cities like Hong Kong , with an average living space of 4·6 m² per person , equivalent to half a parking space . 16 Viral shedding from asymptomatic individuals could be transmitting the virus to others , making it difficult to identify and isolate index patients by contact - tracing for early quarantine . Trans mission from asymptomatic individuals could explain in part the rapid increases in numbers of new cases in high - incidence countries such as the USA , Russia , the UK , Brazil , and European nations . 10 SARS - CoV - 2 could be spreading via respiratory droplets or through direct and indirect contact via the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts . 17 , 18 Considering that most outbreaks on cruise ships are of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections , the risk of infection and associated morbidity and mortality in passengers increases with longer duration of travel and colder weather . 19 , 20 The period of exposure on the Diamond Princess cruise ship was 3 weeks , during which the passengers were unable to disembark , which is consistent with the high number of passengers ( n = 712 ) who contracted the infection . 12 The situation was likely to have been made worse by infected but asymptomatic crew members who continued to work unprotected , but who could have been shedding the virus . A recent modelling study 11 estimated that the initial basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) of the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship was 14·8 , before any infection control measures had been implemented and while the passengers were a completely naive group . The R 0 then decreased to 1·78 after the quarantine and transfer interventions were initiated ( Feb 5 – 17 , 2020 ) . 11 This estimation of R 0 was lower than that of 2·2 ( 95 % CI 1·4 – 3·9 ) that was suggested at the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan , 21 although a higher R 0 of more than 3 has also been reported . 22 An R 0 of 2·2 for COVID - 19 would be similar to that of SARS and influenza . 23 Nevertheless , evacuation of all passengers and crews early on in the outbreak would probably have prevented more infections , as suggested by the current findings . Because the screening test was done between early February and mid - February , before the air evacuation , we assumed that passengers could have acquired and been incubating the infection shortly before the test , and therefore tested negative , or they could have acquired the infection after the test . Based on this assumption , we screened 215 passengers by serial virological , serological , and radiological methods . Our findings show a dynamic clinical presentation of SARS - CoV - 2 . Of the three diagnostic methods we used , the immunoassay for IgG and nasopharyngeal swab RT - qPCR were the most sensitive . Throat swab RT - qPCR was less sensitive ; 24 it identified only the two patients who consistently had the highest viral load in nasopharyngeal swab RT - qPCR and did not identify the other six patients identified by nasopharyngeal swab RT - qPCR . The apparent low sensitivity of throat swab RT - qPCR might also account for the negative screening test done on board the ship by the Japanese Health Ministry . The three patients who were febrile felt transiently unwell , with concomitant symptoms of malaise , unproductive cough , and rhinorrhoea . The higher baseline nasopharyngeal swab viral load in symptomatic than asymptomatic patients in this study could be explained by the difference in time and degree of exposure to the virus , and might not be related to the symptoms . 25 Nevertheless , the per sistent nasopharyngeal viral load in asymptomatic patients is a major concern for infection control . Rectal swabs were negative in all nine patients , which was expected because none of the patients presented with diarrhoea . 18 Important initial laboratory markers , including lymphocyte count , C - reactive protein , and lactate dehydrogenase , remained normal in these asym ptomatic patients . Seroconversion occurred in all nine patients and it was the only diagnostic marker that was positive for one patient in this cohort who had high - resolution CT changes characteristic of a recent SARS - CoV - 2 infection . For those patients who might have acquired the infection earliest and only shortly before the screening test , they might have seroconverted with a high IgG titre and remained asymptomatic with a negative RT - qPCR , with high - resolution CT radiological evidence of SARS - CoV - 2 pneumonitis with ground - glass changes . The immuno - logical response could be explained by the lower respiratory tract infection consistent with pneumonia . Similar to influenza viral infection , patients with severe disease and pneumonia had the highest antibody response . 26 This finding could be related to the more severe viral infection resulting in a stronger induction of the host’s adaptive immunity mediated by B and T cells . 27 Because SARS - CoV - 2 and SARS - CoV have 90 % amino acid homology for nucleoprotein and 73 % amino acid homology for RBD , serum from patients with SARS - CoV might cross - react with our SARS - CoV - 2 immunoassay , as shown by another group . 28 However , the cross - reactivity between SARS - CoV - 2 and other human coronaviruses is expected to be lower , because the amino acid homology with nucleoprotein is less than 50 % . Based on our previous study , 14 the sensitivity of the serology assay was 94 % for anti - nucleoprotein IgG , 88 % for anti - nucleo - protein IgM , 100 % for anti - RBD IgG , and 94 % for anti - RBD IgM . As stated in the Methods , the cutoff was based on a pre - pandemic general population cohort of Articles www . thelancet . com / infection Published online June 12 , 2020 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / S1473 - 3099 ( 20 ) 30364 - 9 9 93 individuals without SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Therefore , we expected that 1 % would be outliers . 14 The clinical presentation of the nine patients in this cohort ranged from mild to severe . Among the mild cases , patients could remain asymptomatic ( patients 3 , 4 , and 5 ) or symptomatic ( patient 8 ) , with no lower respiratory tract involvement , as suggested by normal chest radiograph and high - resolution CT . Their anti - nucleoprotein and anti - RBD IgG levels were low . Patients with moderate infection had lower respiratory tract involvement , as suggested by the ground glass changes on high - resolution CT . Nevertheless , they could still remain asymptomatic ( patients 1 , 2 , and 6 ) or become symptomatic ( patient 7 ) . These patients had higher anti - nucleoprotein and anti - RBD IgG than patients with mild disease . Patient 9 , who acquired the infection more recently , developed symptoms upon hospitalisation . The infection was more severe , involving the lower respiratory tract , with ground glass changes on high - resolution CT . Seroconversion took place during the observation period , with anti - nucleoprotein and anti - RBD IgG still increasing at the end of the observation period . Overall , anti - RBD IgG was the most sensitive serology marker , although the anti - nucleoprotein IgG response was stronger . The difference in anti - RBD IgG and anti - nucleoprotein IgG could be related to the severity of the viral infection , in which anti - RBD IgG was positive even in patients with upper respiratory tract infection , but at low OD values . Indeed , serology provides a feasible strategy to track SARS - CoV - 2 infections . 29 We also investigated changes in IgM / IgG ratio for anti - nucleo - protein and anti - RBD and did not identify any trends that might reflect the timing of infection . Similar to findings from one of the largest case series from China , 8 high - resolution CT provided a reasonable diagnostic tool , especially in asymptomatic patients . In this cohort , it was able to detect lung ground - glass opacities in five of nine patients , including the three patients with asymptomatic lung infection . Similar to other studies , right - side changes were more common . 30 Individuals with more severe radiological changes tended to have higher nasopharyngeal viral load . High - resolution CT could also detect an RT - qPCR - negative asymptomatic patient ( patient 1 ) who had high IgG and IgM titres , suggestive of a recent infection . Nevertheless , individuals who develop only an upper respiratory tract infection could still have a normal high - resolution CT . Chest radiograph detected radiological changes in only four patients . This study has several limitations . We did not have access to the data of patients who were hospitalised in Japan . We also did not have the cabin number and location of the participants when they were on board the ship , which could have provided some insight into how the infection was transmitted . Ten passengers did not give consent to participate in the study , and therefore we did not have their virological or serological data . Lastly , the study period was limited by the quarantine period and we could not follow up the participants beyond 14 days . The participants could have become RT - PCR - positive or antibody - positive after the quarantine period . The cruise ship setting provided an unusual opportunity to study the viral shedding and seroconversion of SARS - CoV - 2 , mimicking the start of a community out - break . Passengers who are exposed to the virus might seroconvert while remaining asymptomatic with a high viral load , and they could continue to shed the virus . High - resolution CT also helped to establish a clinical diagnosis and to detect cases of asymptomatic lung infection . A combination of RT - qPCR and serology should be done to screen for community outbreaks and effectively perform contact tracing .
