Bruijning‑Verhagen 1 Received : 13 December 2021 / Accepted : 5 April 2022 / Published online : 28 May 2022 © The Author ( s ) 2022 Abstract Household transmission studies are useful to quantify SARS - CoV - 2 transmission dynamics . We conducted a remote pro - spective household study to quantify transmission , and the effects of subject characteristics , household characteristics , and implemented infection control measures on transmission . Households with a laboratory - confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 index case were enrolled < 48 h following test result . Follow - up included digitally daily symptom recording , regular nose - throat self - sampling and paired dried blood spots from all household members . Samples were tested for virus detection and SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies . Secondary attack rates ( SARs ) and associated factors were estimated using logistic regression . In 276 households with 920 participants ( 276 index cases and 644 household members ) daily symptom diaries and questionnaires were completed by 95 % , and > 85 % completed sample collection . 200 secondary SARS - CoV - 2 infections were detected , yielding a household SAR of 45 . 7 % ( 95 % CI 39 . 7 – 51 . 7 % ) and per - person SAR of 32 . 6 % ( 95 % CI : 28 . 1 - 37 . 4 % ) . 126 ( 63 % ) secondary cases were detected at enrollment . Mild ( aRR = 0 . 57 ) and asymptomatic index cases ( aRR = 0 . 29 ) were less likely to transmit SARS - CoV - 2 , compared to index cases with an acute respiratory illness ( p = 0 . 03 for trend ) , and child index cases ( < 12 years aRR = 0 . 60 and 12 - 18 years aRR = 0 . 85 ) compared to adults ( p = 0 . 03 for trend ) . Infection control interventions in households had no significant effect on transmission . We found high SARs with the majority of transmissions occuring early after SARS - CoV - 2 introduction into the household . This may explain the futile effect of implemented household measures . Age and symptom status of the index case influence secondary transmission . Remote , digitally - supported study designs with self - sampling are feasible for studying transmission under pandemic restrictions .

D . M . Verberk et al . 1 3 of household transmission and identifying effective house - hold interventions to reduce transmission are , therefore , important for continued epidemic control . As SARS - CoV - 2 infection can present with mild symptoms or occur asymp - tomatic , in particular in younger individuals , SARS - CoV - 2 testing irrespective of symptoms is essential to quantify household transmission and for obtaining unbiased effect estimates of factors influencing transmission . The type and frequency of samples taken within house - hold transmission studies varies and contributes widely to the variation of secondary attack rates ( SARs ) found within previous studies [ 3 – 8 ] . Overall , the denser the sampling , the higher the SAR . For example , two household studies from the USA and the Netherlands found a per - person SAR of 53 % and 43 % , respectively , presumably owing to the dense sampling of both symptomatic and asymptomatic individu - als with regular real - time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) and serology testing [ 3 , 4 ] . These estimates are much higher than the reported average per - person SAR of 16 . 6 % based on a meta - analysis by Madewell et al . [ 5 ] who included mainly studies using passive surveil - lance data of PCR tests only . Household transmission may also depend on socio - cultural factors and living conditions , therefore results may not be generalizable between settings or regions . We conducted a prospective study in the Netherlands , Belgium and Switzerland between April 2020 and April 2021 , investigating transmission from confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 index patients to household members . For infection control purposes , this study was set up fully remote and used regular self - sampling by study participants . This omits the requirement for physical contact between the SARS - CoV - 2 infected household members and study personnel . The aim of this study was to estimate SARs . Second , factors that impact transmission were determined , with a specific focus on the effect of the infection control measures taken in households in the Western European setting . Methods Study design and data collection Within this prospective cohort study , households with at least two members were recruited by the University Medi - cal Centre Utrecht ( UMCU ) , the Netherlands , the Univer - sity Hospital of Antwerp ( UA ) , Belgium and the Univer - sity Children’s Hospital Basel ( UCHB ) , Switzerland either via symptomatic healthcare worker screening programs for SARS - CoV - 2 , drive - through or walk - in testing sites , general practitioner visits or pre - operative screening pro - grams . Households were eligible following a first labora - tory - confirmed positive SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR test result in a household member ( index case ) and enrolled within 48 h following test result . The medical ethical committees of all three sites approved the study . Written informed con - sent was obtained from all participating household mem - bers or their legal guardians . A courier delivered sample kits at home addresses with - out entering the home . Household members received login details and instructions by email to download the study App ( COVapp ) , which is a custom - made application com - patible with Apple and Android systems , developed by the UMCU in collaboration with YourResearch Holding BV . COVapp contained all study related tasks and question - naires along with tutorial videos , FAQs and options to contact the study team . Daily App - notifications were send to participants to remind them to complete diary entry and self - sampling when applicable . Study teams received daily reports on participant non - compliance which was followed - up by email , phone or text - message . Following enrollment , each household member was instructed to take a nose - throat swab by self - sampling at home , irrespective of symptoms , and a dried blood spot ( DBS ) by self - finger - prick . A stool sample on day seven was included for children aged 0 – 2 years . Nose - throat swabs ( NTS ) were repeated if household members developed symptoms of acute respiratory illness ( ARI ) during follow - up . Similarly , an additional stool sample was requested from children < 2 years seven days post - symptom onset . A slightly modified protocol was used at the Swiss site , without a NTS from the index case at enrollment and without collection of stool samples . Self - sampling was supported by instruction videos and leaflets delivered with the sampling material . A telephone help - desk was available 6 days a week during working hours . At baseline , each household member completed a ques - tionnaire including age , comorbidities and recent respira - tory complaints . A household questionnaire was com - pleted by one adult household member , including living conditions and infection control measures taken to prevent household SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . Daily follow - up included a digital diary for each participating household member detailing respiratory and systemic symptoms . Parents or caregivers completed the questionnaires and symptom diaries for their children aged < 16 years , or for family members without access to the app ( Supplement Table 1 ) . Daily follow - up was continued until 21 days after last symptom - onset in any household member . Ten days later a second DBS was collected from all household mem - bers . All data were collected by means of COVapp . All data entered in COVapp were stored in an online secured database . Data were accessible and could be navigated in real time by authorized login through and online portal by the study team . See the Supplement for more details about the data collection . 551 Transmission of SARS‑CoV‑2 within households : a remote prospective cohort study in European… 1 3 Laboratory analyses Nose - throat swabs and stool samples were tested for the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 by RT - PCR as described else - where [ 9 , 10 ] . Specimens with a cycle threshold ( Ct ) value less than or equal to 40 were defined as SARS - CoV - 2 posi - tive . DBS specimens were tested in a final dilution of 1 : 40 by multiplex protein microarray for IgG antibodies target - ing recombinant SARS - CoV - 2 spike ( S ) ectodomain and S1 domain subunit antigens expressed in HEK293 cells as described elsewhere [ 11 – 13 ] . The S1 antigen signal exceed - ing 13 , 000 relative fluorescence units ( RFU ) and a S ecto - domain exceeding 2 , 000 RFU were considered positive ( for details see Supplement ) . Case definitions A new ARI episode based on daily symptom reports was defined as : ( 1 ) new onset of fever or ( 2 ) two consecutive days with at least ( a ) one respiratory symptom ( cough , sore throat , cold , dyspnea ) and one systemic symptom ( headache , muscle ache , cold shivers or fatigue ) or ; ( b ) two respiratory symptoms . A SARS - CoV - 2 infected case was defined as ( 1 ) a posi - tive RT - PCR result from nose - throat or fecal sample , or a documented positive test result from external source ( i . e . municipal testing facility ; ) or ( 2 ) SARS - CoV - 2 negative serology at enrollment and positive serology at end of fol - low - up ( seroconversion ) ; or ( 3 ) positive serology at enroll - ment and recent ( < 2 weeks before enrollment ) respiratory symptoms . For each case , the symptom status was classified as ARI ( meeting ARI case definition ) ; mildly symptomatic ( some respiratory or systemic symptoms but not meeting ARI threshold ) or asymptomatic ( no symptoms reported ) . A secondary case was defined as any SARS - CoV - 2 infection in a household member not being the index case , detected at enrollment or during follow - up , regardless of symptom onset . Statistical analysis Secondary attack rate Household SAR was calculated by dividing the number of households with at least one secondary case by the total number of participating households . The per - person SAR was calculated by dividing the number of secondary cases by the number of household members at risk ( i . e . excluding the index case ) . To account for within household cluster - ing the per - person SAR was estimated using generalized estimating equations ( GEE ) with a log link function and exchangeable correlation structure . Household members with an unknown secondary case status ( i . e . no test result available to determine absence or presence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection ) were excluded from analysis . We explored household , household member - and index case characteristics associated with SARS - CoV - 2 transmis - sion , as well as the impact of household infection control measures on transmission using univariate and multivari - able analyses . Characteristics and measures with a univariate p - value of < 0 . 1 were included in multivariable analysis . The outcomes represents a relative risk ( RR ) . We conducted three sensitivity - analyses ; ( 1 ) Household and per - person SAR were calculated excluding household members with a positive RT - PCR at enrollment to exclude possible co - primary cases jointly infected by an external source . ( 2 ) For comparison of our results with other ( retro - spective ) household studies that most commonly apply PCR testing for symptomatic subjects only and without serologi - cal testing , we calculated household and per - persons SAR including only symptomatic secondary cases with positive RT - PCR result . ( 3 ) The effect of implemented infection con - trol measures was recalculated excluding households with a co - primary case as transmission had probably already occurred within these households . All analyses were performed in R version 4 . 0 . 3 ( R Foun - dation for Statistical Computing , Vienna , Austria ) . Results From April 2020 until April 2021 , a total of 276 households were enrolled including 920 subjects ( 276 index cases and 644 household members ; Table 1 and 2 ) : 208 households at UMCU , 32 at UA and 36 at UCHB . 173 ( 62 . 6 % ) house - holds were enrolled during the first epidemic wave between September and November 2020 . The median household size was 3 persons ( IQR : 2 – 4 ) and the majority were families ( 68 . 3 % ) . The median duration of daily follow - up per house - hold was 36 days ( IQR : 31 – 46 days ) . In total 877 ( 95 . 3 % ) participant diaries and > 98 % of the baseline household and participant questionnaires were completed . In addi - tion , 80 – 95 % of the requested NTS and DBS samples were collected . Sample completeness depended on the type and timing of the requested sample . Analysis of 167 ( 18 . 2 % ) DBS at enrollment and 85 ( 9 . 2 % ) at study completion failed because they were insufficiently saturated leaving too little volume for analysis . See Supplement Table 2 and Table 3 for more details . The median age of index cases was 36 years ( IQR : 24 – 50 years ) , 46 ( 16 . 8 % ) were < 18 years ( Table 1 ) . The median time between index symptom onset and positive test result was 2 days ( IQR : 1 – 4 days ) and study enroll - ment started a median of 4 days ( IQR : 3 – 5 days ) after symp - tom onset . In total 264 index cases developed symptoms , while nine remained asymptomatic throughout the study . Of 552 J . D . M .

For 14 ( 5 . 1 % ) index cases the information on symptoms was missing at enrollment . Out of 658 household members , 14 were excluded from further analyses because their secondary case status could not be determined ( Fig . 1 ) . Among the 498 household mem - bers with serology at baseline , 24 ( 4 . 8 % ) had evidence of previous infection ( detectable SARS - CoV - 2 IgG antibod - ies at enrollment and no respiratory symptoms in the past 2 weeks ) . Of these , two ( 8 . 3 % ) also had a positive RT - PCR at enrollment ( CT - values 21 . 4 and 32 . 1 ) , possibly indicating asymptomatic re - infection . Of the 644 household members at risk , 200 classified as secondary case . Of these , 166 ( 25 , 8 % ) were detected based on positive PCR , 28 ( 4 . 4 % ) by seroconversion only and 6 ( 0 . 9 % ) by positive serology at enrollment in combination with recent ( < 2 weeks ago ) respiratory complaints . In total 126 ( 63 . 0 % ) secondary cases had a SARS - CoV - 2 positive PCR test at enrollment ( i . e . possible co - primary cases , Fig . 2 ) . Respiratory symptoms at enrollment were present in 87 ( 43 . 5 % ) of them and 15 ( 7 . 5 % ) reported that symptoms had already started before enrollment . Of the 46 ( 23 . 0 % ) secondary cases detected post - enrollment , 33 ( 71 . 7 % ) took place in the first 5 days of follow - up , 10 ( 21 . 7 % ) between day 6 – 10 and 3 ( 6 . 5 % ) after day 10 . In total 28 ( 14 . 0 % ) infections were detected by seroconversion only ( Table 2 ) . Secondary attack rates Household secondary transmission was detected in 126 out of 276 households resulting in a household SAR of 45 . 7 % ( 95 % CI 39 . 7 – 51 . 7 % ; Table 3 ) . In total , 200 second - ary cases were detected among 644 household members ( per - person SAR : 32 . 6 % ; 95 % CI 28 . 1 – 37 . 4 % ; Table 3 ) .

Using a more restrictive testing policy of RT - PCR testing for sympto - matic cases only , yielded a household SAR of 35 . 9 % ( 95 % CI 30 . 3 – 41 . 9 % ) and a per - person SAR of 19 . 3 % ( 95 % CI 15 . 7 – 23 . 5 % ) . The effect of infection control measures on secondary transmission did not change when excluding the households with co - primary cases . In the univariable analysis , use of surgical masks was associated with lower SAR ( RR : 0 . 32 ; 95 % CI 0 . 05 – 0 . 96 ) , but this effect was no longer significant in multivariate analysis . Discussion In this international prospective study of 276 index subjects with SARS - CoV - 2 and 644 household members , SARS - CoV - 2 transmission was demonstrated in 126 ( 45 . 7 % ) households and on average 32 . 6 % of household members got infected . Transmission rates declined with age of the index case and increased with symptom severity of ARI , confirming earlier observations [ 5 , 14 – 16 ] . Two - thirds of the secondary infections among household members had already occurred at enrollment . Preventive measures implemented in the household had no discernable protective effect against transmission . The fully remote , digitally supported study with self - sampling appeared feasible for studying transmis - sion under pandemic restrictions . The household and per - person SARs found in this study are at the high end of the 4 % to 53 % reported in previous studies [ 3 – 8 , 17 – 22 ] . While this may reflect true differences in local transmission dynamics across studies , two major fac - tors determining SAR estimates are : 1 ) the intensity of sam - pling protocols used and 2 ) in - or exclusion of co - primary cases as a secondary case in the SAR calculation . In a review by Fung et al . [ 17 ] SAR estimates more than doubled in studies with a RT - PCR test frequency of > 2 tests compared to one test .

D . M . Verberk et al . 1 3 follow - up , combining RT - PCR screening of all symptomatic and asymptomatic household members , repeated RT - PCR testing for new onset ARI and paired antibody testing of all subjects . This allowed detection of asymptomatic infections , and those with negative RT - PCR results . Indeed , studies that used equally or more dense sampling protocols report SARs similar to our estimates [ 3 , 4 , 6 ] . To quantify the effect of sampling protocols on the estimated SAR , we calculated the household and per - person SARs in our study excluding asymptomatic and RT - PCR negative subjects . This would reduce the detected SARs by 9 . 8 % and 13 . 3 % respectively , which is more in line with estimates from ( retrospective ) household studies that are based on contact tracing inves - tigations with symptom - based RT - PCR testing alone . We therefore conclude that the use of this methodology under - estimates the SAR by at least 10 % . In addition , in our main analysis we considered the index case as the primary case in the household , but it is possible that other household mem - bers were infected concurrently by an external source . Con - sidering these as co - primary cases would decline SAR by approximately 15 % . This could be interpreted as the lower bound of the household and per - person SAR . Of note , all households were enrolled during a period where the more transmissible mutant strains , in particular the Delta vari - ant and later Omicron , did not yet circulate much in the Netherlands , Belgium or Switzerland [ 23 – 26 ] . It is likely that household SARs will be higher for the new and more transmissible variants of SARS - CoV - 2 . On the other hand , households were included before the SARS - CoV - 2 vaccina - tion program was ( fully ) rolled out and only a small propor - tion of the population had prior immunity . In line with earlier findings , household contacts of index cases with more severe respiratory symptoms are at higher risk for secondary infection [ 5 , 7 , 17 , 27 ] and transmis - sion was highest when the index case was above the age of 18 . Our study also suggests lower transmission from child index cases compared to adults , but it must be considered that children are more often mildly or asymptomatic when infected . Undetected introduction of SARS - CoV - 2 infection by a pediatric primary case will therefore be more common compared to an adult primary case , which could have led to some misclassification of the index . The high number of co - primary cases in this study and the fact that nearly all other secondary cases turned PCR positive within the first 5 days of follow - up , indicates that household transmission predominantly takes place before or around the time of detection of the index case . It is esti - mated that up to 44 % of transmission occurs during the pre - symptomatic period in settings with substantial household clustering [ 28 ] . This may explain why household infection control measures implemented following diagnosis were not effective in preventing transmission in our study , except for possibly some effect of masking . The use of rapid antigen self - tests at symptom onset or asymptomatic screening fol - lowed by immediate implementation of infection control measures could possibly help reduce household transmis - sion . In a qualitative sub - study in this cohort , household members reported difficulties in maintaining measures over time [ 29 ] . Compliance may increase if the recommended period for infection control measures in the household is shortened [ 29 ] and the number of measures reduced to those with evidence of effectiveness such as wearing a facemask [ 30 – 33 ] . Our data do not suggest any additive effect of mul - tiple infection control measures . Of note , isolation outside the home was not deployed as policy in the Netherlands , Belgium or Switzerland and therefore not evaluated in this study . For infection prevention purposes , this study was set up as a fully remote , digitally supported , study . Physical contact with participants was omitted by using self - sampling meth - ods instead of sampling by healthcare professionals as done in most SARS - CoV - 2 transmission studies [ 3 , 34 , 35 ] . The design of this study appeared feasible with > 95 % complete - ness of diaries and questionnaires , and 80 – 95 % complete - ness of samples requested during study participation . This design is particularly suitable when studying transmission under pandemic restrictions . In addition , running a fully remote study may also be more feasible in remote areas or when study participants cover a large geographical area and repeated study visits are too expensive or logistically unfeasible . Our study has some limitations that merit discussion . First , many household members already tested positive at enrollment . As discussed above , it is possible that other household members were infected concurrently by an external source ( co - primary case ) , overestimating the SAR . Furthermore , it is possible that some transmission between household members occurred in the opposite direction . In particular , asymptomatic or mild infections could have remained undetected until a second fully symptomatic infection occurred in the household , misclassifying pri - mary and secondary cases . This in turn , can bias estimates on index or household contact characteristics influencing SAR . In particular the relative infectiousness of children versus adult index cases is difficult to assess without com - plete ( asymptomatic ) index case ascertainment . Alterna - tive enrollment criteria , for instance based on household exposure rather than confirmed infection , would be needed to improve differentiation between primary and secondary cases and reconstruction of transmission chains . Second , we assumed that household transmission was responsible for all infections among household contacts . The household SAR could therefore be overestimated . However , with quarantine and isolation orders in place , community exposure among household contacts was probably minimal . Third , despite our extensive sampling protocol , it is likely that some 559 Transmission of SARS‑CoV‑2 within households : a remote prospective cohort study in European… 1 3 infections were missed , thereby underestimating the SAR . In particular , asymptomatic or subjects with mild symptoms may have a weak or undetectable humoral response [ 36 , 37 ] and such infections may have been missed if they occurred post - enrollment . In addition , we cannot exclude some loss in sensitivity due to self - collecting of NTS , although ear - lier studies suggest minimal impact on detection as com - pared to samples collected by healthcare professionals [ 38 ] . Similarly , self - collected DBS samples may be less sensi - tive than serum samples , although they have been proven a valid alternative for serum [ 39 – 41 ] . Serology analysis of 252 ( 13 . 7 % ) DBS samples failed because of to little blood volume . Choosing alternative ways of collecting blood sam - ples , e . g . using tubes instead of DBS or samples taken by a research nurse , might improve completeness of serology results . Fourth , the study population might not be completely representative . The percentage of households with a high educational level and the percentage of healthcare workers in the study , of which the latter are dominantly women , were overrepresented compared to the average Dutch , Belgian and Swiss population [ 42 ] . Finally , this study was conducted before SARS - CoV - 2 vaccination was implemented . Natu - rally , household transmission will be strongly influenced by presence of vaccine immunity both among index cases and among household members . [ 43 – 46 ] . Conclusion Using a fully remote , digitally supported study design we were able to study household transmission in a pandemic setting . Our study shows a high household SAR ( 45 . 7 % ) and per - person SAR ( 27 . 8 % ) for SARS - CoV - 2 in the Western European context in the era before widespread circulation of alpha and delta variants and vaccine implementation . Trans - mission rates were associated with symptom severity and age of the index case . Most household transmission occured before or around the time of detection of the index case , with no impact of household infection control measures on trans - mission , except possibly for wearing a face mask .
