The CCND1 and EMS1 copy number in tumor samples was estimated by differential PCR . The presence or absence of amplification was analyzed in relation to clinicopathological variables , tumor recur - rence , and patient survival . CCND1 amplification occurred in 32 cases ( 31 % ) and was associated with increased lymph node stage ( P 5 0 . 005 ) and advanced disease stage ( P 5 0 . 003 ) . EMS1 amplification was identified in 21 cases ( 20 % ) and was related with advanced T stages ( P 5 0 . 001 ) , in - creased lymph node stage ( P 5 0 . 02 ) , advanced disease stage ( P 5 0 . 041 ) , poor histological differentiation ( P 5 0 . 018 ) , recurrent disease ( P 5 0 . 0004 ) , and reduced disease - specific survival ( P < 0 . 0001 ) . Coamplification of both genes oc - curred in 11 cases ( 11 . 5 % ) . Multivariate analysis confirmed that in addition to regional lymph node status , EMS1 am - plification is an independent predictor of death from the tumor ( P 5 0 . 0027 ) . CCND1 amplification was not prognos - tic . These data indicate that EMS1 amplification , but not CCND1 amplification , predicts early recurrence and re - duced survival in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck . The prognostic significance previously attributed to CCND1 amplification may be attributable to its frequent coamplification with EMS1 . INTRODUCTION The survival rate for patients with SCCHN 3 ( 1 ) has re - mained unchanged in recent years despite the advances in di - agnosis and treatment . Our ability to prognosticate for advanced cases of SCCHN is particularly poor owing to variations in the biological behavior of the tumors and inadequacies of the pres - ent staging system . It is therefore essential to identify new markers ( e . g . , genetic markers ) that may distinguish differences in tumor behavior . Multiple genes and chromosomal regions are implicated in SCCHN tumorigenesis . Amplification of chromosomal region 11q13 is one of the genetic alterations most frequently observed in SCCHN ( 1 – 7 ) . The amplified 11q13 region is estimated to be 3 – 5 megabases in size and includes four putative oncogenes : CCND1 ( PRAD1 ) , FGF3 ( INT2 ) , FGF4 ( HST1 ) , and EMS1 . CCND1 and EMS1 are the more prominent candidate oncogenes because they were found to be also overexpressed in all carci - nomas with an 11q13 amplification ( 8 ) . Therefore , the activa - tion of these genes might confer the selective advantage to these tumors . The CCND1 gene encodes the cell cycle regulating cyclin D1 protein involved in the G 1 - to - S transition . EMS1 encodes a cytoskeletal protein homologous to the avian F actin - binding protein ( cortactin ) , which is thought to be involved in cell - to - cell interactions ( 8 ) . Amplification of the chromosome 11q13 region in SCCHN has been correlated with aggressive tumor growth ( 3 , 9 ) , the presence of lymph node metastases ( 7 , 10 – 12 ) , and poor prog - nosis ( 9 ) . In addition , various studies have assessed the clinical and prognostic significance of CCND1 amplification and / or overexpression , showing an association with recurrence and shortened overall survival ( 6 , 13 – 17 ) . However , little is known about the prognostic significance of EMS1 amplification in SCCHN . Because EMS1 amplification in tumors results in over - expression of cortactin and this is accompanied by a partial redistribution of cortactin from the cytoplasm into cell - matrix contact sites , it has been suggested that EMS1 amplification can contribute to the invasive potential of tumor cells ( 8 , 18 ) . We hypothesized that , although both CCND1 and EMS1 contribute to the growth advantage of SCCHN with 11q13 amplification , amplification of each gene individually may con - fer different properties to these tumors . The purpose of this study was therefore to assess the correlation between CCND1 and / or EMS1 amplification , the clinicopathological characteris - tics , and tumor behavior in SCCHN . To evaluate CCND1 and EMS1 amplifications , we have used differential PCR , which is a rapid , simple , and sensitive method to determine semiquantitatively the number of gene copies . It only requires small amounts of DNA , which facilitates these studies in clinical medicine . MATERIALS AND METHODS Tumor Specimens . Tissue samples of 104 consecutive primary SCCHN were obtained from patients undergoing sur - gical resection of their tumor between January 1992 and July 1994 .

None of the patients were thought to have had distant metastases at the time of surgery . All but one subject were smokers , and 94 of them were also habitual alcohol drinkers . The exceptionally low proportion of women in the sample ( only one ) is usual for this kind of tumor in our media . A total of 56 patients received postoperative radiotherapy . As a general rule , this was administered to the patients with histologically N 2 or N 3 neck lesions , and also to the patients with N 0 - N 1 neck lesions with locally advanced stage ( T 4 ) . The clinicopathological data from the patients are shown in Table 1 . The stage of disease was determined after the surgical resection of the tumor ( with lymph node dissection where ap - propriate ) according to the TNM system of the Union Interna - tionale Contre le Cancer ( Ed . 4 ) . DNA Isolation and PCR Analysis . Tissue specimens were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at 2 70°C until DNA extraction . High - molecular - weight DNA was iso - lated by standard phenol - chloroform extraction as previously described ( 19 ) . The PCR mixtures contained 0 . 2 – 0 . 5 m g of target DNA , 10 m M Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 3 ) , 1 . 5 m M MgCl 2 , 50 m M KCl , 0 . 2 m M each of deoxynucleotide triphosphate , 1 m M of each primer , and 1 unit of Taq polymerase ( Boehringer Mannheim , Mannheim , Germany ) in a total volume of 50 m l with a 50 - m l mineral oil overlay . The PCR cycles included 1 min at each temperature ( 94°C , 56°C , and 72°C ) , for a total of 30 cycles , and a final cycle at 72°C for 7 min . Two different sets of primers , one for the target gene ( CCND1 or EMS1 ) and the other for the control gene , were present simulta - neously in the reaction vessel , as previously described ( 20 , 21 ) . The TH gene , which is located on the same chromosome as the target genes , was used as the control gene . Primer sequences were de - signed from the genomic sequences ( obtained from GenBank ) . 4 Primers for the CCND1 gene were 5 9 - CGTACCCCG - ATGC - CAACC and 5 9 - ATGGACGGCAGGACCTCC , and they ampli - fied a fragment of 121bp . Primers for the EMS1 gene were 5 9 - TCCCCTGATGCCCAGGTC and 5 9 - TCC - CAATCCAGAG - ACCCG , and they amplified a sequence of 111 bp . Primers for the TH gene were 5 9 - GCCCCAGCTGCATCCTAC and 5 9 - CTTG - GCAGACACCTGGGG , and they amplified a sequence of 188 bp . The primers were purchased from MWG - Biotech ( Mannheim , Germany ) . Samples of DNA from normal tissues ( tonsils ) obtained from noncancer patients were used as negative controls . As positive controls , a mixture of DNA from normal tissue and increasing amounts of a previously PCR - amplified sequence of the target gene ( CCND1 or EMS1 ) , mimicking different degrees of amplification , was used as template in the PCR reaction , as previously described ( 19 ) . Electrophoresis and Quantitation of PCR Products . After PCR , 10 m l of each sample were electrophoresed on gels containing 3 % NuSieve agarose ( FMC , Rockland , ME ) and 1 % molecular biology grade agarose ( Promega , Madison , WI ) for 1 . 5 h at 65 V in 40 m M Tris - Acetate and 2 m M EDTA buffer . The gels were stained with ethidium bromide , and the images of the UV - illuminated gels were captured using a digital camera and stored in an IBM - compatible PC system . The bands were thereafter quantitated by computerized densitometric analysis techniques ( Kodak Digital Science 10 , Eastman Software , Bil - lerica , MA ) , and the CCND1 or EMS1 : TH ratios were deter - mined . The results of densitometry were corroborated by visual inspection of the gels . Statistical Analysis . Statistical analysis was performed using x 2 , with Yates’ correction where appropriate , and Fisher’s exact tests . Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan - Meier product limit estimate ( 22 ) . Deaths from causes other than the index tumor or its metastases were not considered treatment failures , and these patients were censored in all analysis involv - ing the length of survival . Differences between survival times were analyzed by the log - rank method ( 23 ) . Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models ( 24 ) were used to examine the relative impact of either variables demonstrated to be statis - tically significant in univariate analysis or those variables likely to have an effect on outcome ( e . g . , tumor site and histopatho - logical grade ) . In these models , tumor sites were dichotomized as oral cavity and pharynx versus larynx . Similarly , T - stage 4 Internet address : http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov .

Lymph node metastasis classification was dichotomized as N 0 or N 1 versus N 2 or N 3 . Stage was dichotomized as stage I , stage II , or stage III versus stage IV . Finally , histopathological grade was dichotomized as well - and moderately differentiated versus poorly differentiated . P s # 0 . 05 were considered to be statis - tically significant . Patients were observed for at least 36 months . RESULTS Differential PCR . A total of 104 samples from patients with SCCHN were studied . Each sample was investigated for CCND1 and EMS1 amplifications by differential PCR using the gene for TH as the control . Samples of DNA obtained from normal tissues showed CCND1 : TH ratios of 1 . 2 6 0 . 21 ( mean 6 SD ) and EMS1 : TH ratios of 0 . 9 6 0 . 1 ( mean 6 SDs obtained from 10 different samples ) . The positive controls showed that there was an increase in the PCR product from the target gene , compared with the PCR product from the control gene , as the target gene copy number used as the template was increased ( data not shown ) . Experimentally , gene amplification was defined as at least a 2 - fold increase in the CCND1 : TH or EMS1 : TH ratios , relative to the ratios obtained with normal tissue DNA . Because of the semiquantitative nature of the differential PCR , the ratios obtained were not converted to a score of amplification ; the results were expressed as amplifica - tion or no amplification of the CCND1 or EMS1 genes . PCR was carried out at least twice in the positive cases . CCND1 and EMS1 amplifications were found in 32 ( 31 % ) and 21 ( 20 % ) of the 104 tumor samples , respectively . Coam - plification of both genes was demonstrated in 11 cases ( 11 . 5 % ) . None of the cases considered nonamplified presented a CCND1 : TH ratio higher than 1 . 9 ( mean 6 SD , 1 . 3 6 0 . 2 ) , or an EMS1 : TH ratio higher than 1 . 8 ( mean 6 SD , 1 . 2 6 0 . 2 ) . Fig . 1 shows the results of the differential PCR in some of the ampli - fied cases . Association of Amplification of CCND1 or EMS1 with Clinicopathological Parameters . Table 2 presents the corre - lation of CCND1 and EMS1 amplifications with clinical stage , pathological grading , primary site , relapse , and disease out - come . Amplified cases were found at each primary head and neck anatomical site , with no statistically significant differ - ences . However , in the cases with CCND1 amplification , there was a tendency toward higher frequency of amplification in those cases with hypopharyngeal localization . Sixteen ( 76 % ) of the 21 cases with EMS1 amplification were observed in T 4 - stage tumors , with the association being statistically significant ( P 5 0 . 001 ) . CCND1 amplification was also more frequent in T 4 - stage tumors , although in this case , the differences were not statistically significant ( P 5 0 . 12 ) . Both CCND1 and EMS1 amplifications were associated with increased regional lymph node disease ( Table 2 ) . Because CCND1 and EMS1 amplifica - tions correlate with advanced T and N stages , none of the patients with either stage I or II disease had CCND1 or EMS1 amplification , resulting in a statistically significant association between advanced disease stage and amplification of these genes . No relationship was observed between CCND1 amplifi - cation and histopathological differentiation . However , EMS1 amplification was significantly associated with poorly differen - tiated tumors ( P 5 0 . 018 ) . Amplification of CCND1 and / or EMS1 and Disease Course . Seventeen patients that died from causes not related to the index tumor were excluded from the recurrence analysis ( four of them had CCND1 amplification , and three had EMS1 amplification ) . Of the remaining 28 CCND1 - amplified cases , 21 ( 75 % ) had tumor recurrence ( local / regional recurrence or distant metastases ) , compared with 35 ( 57 % ) in the nonamplified group , that did not reach statistical significance ( Table 2 ) . The differences in recurrence rates were statistically significant when the cases with and without EMS1 amplification were compared ( Table 2 ) : 18 ( 100 % ) of the 18 EMS1 - amplified cases versus 37 ( 54 % ) of the 69 nonamplified cases presented recur - rence . Then , it seems that EMS1 amplification has a stronger relationship with tumor recurrence than CCND1 amplification . It is confirmed if we compare the recurrence rates when the coamplified cases are considered separately ( Table 3 ) ; in this fashion , recurrences were found in 10 ( 59 % ) of 17 cases with CCND1 amplification , 7 ( 100 % ) of 7 cases with EMS1 ampli - fication , 11 ( 100 % ) of 11 coamplified cases , and 27 ( 52 % ) of 52 nonamplified cases . The results of univariate Kaplan - Meier analyses are shown in Fig . 2 . The analyses demonstrated that EMS1 amplification had a statistically significant association with shorter disease - specific survival ( log - rank P , 0 . 0001 ) in this patient popula - tion . The data in Fig . 2 also suggest that there was an associa - tion , although not statistically significant ( log - rank P 5 0 . 073 ) , of CCND1 amplification with disease course . This is likely to be the result of its frequent coamplification with EMS1 . Other parameters that had statistically significant association with a reduced disease - specific survival were : tumor size T 4 ( log - rank P 5 0 . 047 ) , locoregional lymph node metastases of class N 2 or greater ( log - rank P 5 0 . 0002 ) , stage IV disease ( log - rank P 5 0 . 0018 ) , and pharyngeal localization of the tumor ( log - rank P 5 0 . 031 ) . The influence of postoperative radiotherapy on survival cannot be addressed because it was administered mainly to the Fig . 1 Differential PCR analysis of CCND1 ( A ) and EMS1 ( B ) gene amplifications from various tumor samples in which gene amplification was found . The PCR products were separated by agarose gel electro - phoresis and quantified by image analysis densitometry .

Because CCND1 and EMS1 amplifications were associated with advanced disease stage , most of the amplified cases received this treatment ( 25 of 32 with CCND1 amplifica - tion and 17 of 21 with EMS1 amplification ) . Then , it seems unlikely that this can influence the differences in survival be - tween the amplified and the nonamplified cases . The results of the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model showed two parameters that were statistically significant independent predictors of a reduced disease - specific survival ( Table 4 ) : cervical lymph node metastases of class N 2 or greater and EMS1 amplification . Amplification of the EMS1 gene ap - peared to confer an adjusted relative risk of 2 . 58 for dying of the index cancer ( 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 3 – 8 . 99 ) . Amplifica - tion of the CCND1 gene did not enter in either of the multiva - riate Cox models . DISCUSSION Amplification of the chromosome 11q13 region has been observed in a variety of human malignancies . The highest fre - quencies of amplification have been found in adenocarcinomas of the breast and in squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus and the head and neck region ( 8 ) . Although various genes are consistently present on the amplified 11q13 region , only CCND1 and EMS1 are likely to be the key genes within this region because in addition to being frequently coamplified , they were found to be overexpressed in all tumors with an 11q13 amplification ( 8 ) . CCND1 encodes the cyclin D1 , a G 1 cyclin involved in the G 1 - to - S transition that functions as a positive cell cycle regulator ( 25 ) . The EMS1 gene encodes cortactin , a cytoskeletal protein involved in regulating the interactions be - tween components in the adherens junctions , and as such , its overexpression might affect the organization and functioning of cytoskeleton and cell - adhesion structures and hence , contribute to the invasive behavior of tumor cells ( 18 , 26 ) .

Several works have focused on CCND1 amplification and showed similar results ( 4 , 6 , 13 , 17 ) . In contrast , only a few studies have also analyzed EMS1 ampli - fication ( 3 , 8 , 9 , 12 ) . In these series , as in our study , CCND1 and EMS1 have not been uniformly amplified in all cases . These differences in amplification of 11q13 markers were also de - scribed in breast carcinomas ( 27 ) , and they are in agreement with the structure of the 11q13 amplicon proposed by Schuuring ( 8 ) : the amplified 11q13 region harbors at least three , or even more , separate cores of amplification . The first core extends from BCL1 to FGF4 , with the CCND1 gene as the best candi - date key gene . The second core extends from FGF3 to the EMS1 gene , with the EMS1 gene as the best candidate key gene . Another two cores of amplification have been described in the centromeric and the telomeric borders , respectively , of the 11q13 region ; as yet , no gene has been identified in these subregions . The results of the present study indicate that the amplifi - cation of EMS1 is of prognostic value for SCCHN independent of other known risk factors . In fact , all of the patients with EMS1 amplification experienced disease recurrence . In contrast , CCND1 amplification has not found to be of prognostic signif - icance in multivariate analysis . In other reports , 11q13 amplifi - cation ( without reference to specific genes ) was observed in patients with advanced disease , a poorly differentiated histology of the tumor , and deeply invasive growth ( 3 ) . In concordance with the presumed association with progressed disease , the amplified cases develop more frequent recurrences and have an increased risk of tumor - associated death ( 6 , 7 , 9 ) . Opposite reports ( 5 , 11 ) indicate the controversy on this point . This may be attributable to the use of different 11q13 markers , measuring only one of the amplification cores to analyze 11q13 amplifi - cation . On the other hand , the amplification and / or overexpres - sion of CCND1 has been reported to be a poor prognostic sign in various studies focused on this gene ( 6 , 13 – 17 ) . Again , there are also reports on the contrary ( 4 , 28 ) . In addition , the associ - ation of CCND1 amplification and / or overexpression and poor prognosis is not absolute , suggesting that amplification and / or overexpression of CCND1 contributes only partially to the proc - ess of tumor progression . Our findings indicate that the ampli - fication of CCND1 loses its prognostic significance when the cases in which CCND1 is coamplified with the EMS1 gene are eliminated . Thus , the prognostic significance attributed to the CCND1 amplification may be attributable to its frequent coam - plification with the EMS1 gene . This agrees with the proposed role of these genes in tumor development ( 8 ) : CCND1 overex - pression might confer to the tumor cells the ability to proliferate under reduced growth factor conditions because of its effects in the G 1 - to - S transition of the cell cycle ; EMS1 overexpression might mediate the increased invasive and metastatic behavior of tumor cells attributable to its effects in the organization and the functioning of cytoskeleton and cell adhesion structures . Differential PCR has previously been shown as a simple , rapid , and sensitive method to detect genetic amplification ( 17 , 19 – 21 ) . Our results corroborate that of others , showing that this method is suitable to detect gene amplification . It is reproduc - ible , and its main advantage is that small quantities of DNA are needed , making possible its clinical use with samples obtained from small biopsies or fine needle aspirations . Using this tech - nique , we have found an 11q13 amplification rate in agreement with previous studies that used conventional techniques . We conclude that amplification of the EMS1 gene is an independent prognostic marker for survival , and it specifies a Table 4 Forward stepwise Cox analysis of disease - specific survival in 104 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck Variable P s for each step 0 1 2 Site 0 . 031 0 . 081 0 . 16 pT stage 0 . 047 0 . 24 0 . 90 pN stage 0 . 0002 0 . 0035 0 . 0043 a Disease stage 0 . 0018 0 . 012 0 . 55 Pathologic grade 0 . 20 0 . 43 0 . 54 EMS1 amplification 0 . 0000 0 . 0001 a 0 . 0027 CCND1 amplification 0 . 073 0 . 17 0 . 59 a P s indicate the variable entered in the model at each step .

Whether this is the result of greater tumor aggressiveness or of decreased responsiveness to adjuvant radiotherapy remains to be elucidated . Presently , clinical and histopathological parameters are used as guides for the application of adjunctive therapy , such as radiotherapy or even resection of the surgical field . Our data suggest that EMS1 amplification can augment the predictive power of those clinical and histopathological markers . Routine implementation of this molecular test will require confirmation of our findings in larger prospective studies . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Dr . Enrique F .
