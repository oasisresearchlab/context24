E . histolytica relies on motility , phagocytosis , host cell adhesion , and proteolysis of extracellular matrix for virulence . In eukaryotic cells , these processes are mediated in part by phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) signaling . Thus , PI3K may be critical for virulence . We utilized a func - tional genomics approach to identify genes whose products may operate in the PI3K pathway in E . histolytica . We treated a pop - ulation of trophozoites that were overexpressing genes from a cDNA library with a near - lethal dose of the PI3K inhibitor wort - mannin . This screen was based on the rationale that survivors would be overexpressing gene products that directly or indirectly function in the PI3K pathway . We sequenced the overexpressed genes in survivors and identiﬁed a cDNA encoding a Rap GTPase , a protein previously shown to participate in the PI3K pathway . This supports the validity of our approach . Genes en - coding a coactosin - like protein , EhCoactosin , and a serine - rich E . histolytica protein ( SREHP ) were also identiﬁed . Cells overex - pressing EhCoactosin or SREHP were also less sensitive to a second PI3K inhibitor , LY294002 . This corroborates the link be - tween these proteins and PI3K . Finally , a mutant cell line with an increased level of phosphatidylinositol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) - triphosphate , the product of PI3K activity , exhibited increased expression of SREHP and EhCoactosin . This further supports the functional connection between these proteins and PI3K in E . histolytica . To our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst forward - genetics screen adapted to reveal genes participating in a signal transduction pathway in this pathogen . E ntamoeba histolytica is an enteric protozoan parasite that causes amoebiasis and amoebic liver abscess in humans ( 1 ) . It is prevalent in developing countries that cannot prevent its fecal - oral spread . E . histolytica enters the human host upon ingestion of water or food contaminated with environmentally stable cysts . After passing through the stomach , excystation leads to the release of trophozoites , which migrate to the bowel lumen for coloniza - tion . In 10 % of infected individuals , infection can progress from a noninvasive stage to an invasive stage ( 2 ) , during which the para - site binds to and destroys colonic epithelium . From here , the par - asites enter the circulatory system and translocate to other organs . The most common site of extraintestinal infection is the liver , characterized by the formation of amebic liver abscess ( ALA ) . E . histolytica relies on cell motility , phagocytosis , proteolysis of host extracellular matrix , and host cell adhesion for virulence ( 3 ) . In other eukaryotic cells , these processes are mediated in part by phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) signaling ( 4 ) . PI3Ks phos - phorylate phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) and its derivatives to generate signaling lipids such as phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( PI3P ) , phosphatidylinositol3 , 4 - bisphosphate [ PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ] , phosphatidyl - inositol 3 , 5 - bisphosphate [ PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ] , and phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate [ PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ] ( reviewed in reference 5 ) . These lipids propagate a signal by interacting with proteins harboring speciﬁc domains , such as the FYVE ﬁnger domains , which bind PI3P , and pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domains , which bind PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ( reviewed in reference 6 ) . The activity of PI3K can be countered by the action of phosphatases , such as phosphatase and tensin homolog ( PTEN ) , which dephosphory - late phosphoinositides ( reviewed in reference 7 ) . In E . histolytica , the products of PI3Ks have been studied using glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - and green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) - tagged versions of FYVE and PH domains ( 8 – 10 ) . These studies have shown that PI3P localizes to E . histolytica phago - somes ( 8 , 9 ) and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 localizes to both pseudopods and phagosomes ( 10 ) . Studies using small - molecule inhibitors of PI3K , such as LY294002 and wortmannin , have also been carried out . Treatment of E . histolytica trophozoites with wortmannin inhibits directional cell polarization ( 11 ) , motility , actin cytoskel - etal rearrangements , proteolytic activity , and the development of ALA in an animal model of disease ( 12 ) . Exposure to either LY294002 ( 13 ) or wortmannin ( 14 ) inhibits pinocytosis of a ﬂu - orescent ﬂuid - phase marker , ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - dextran , and disrupts phagocytosis ( 8 , 10 , 14 ) and adhesion to host cells in a dose - dependent manner ( 8 ) . Several unique aspects of PI3K activity in E . histolytica make it worthy of study . First , expression of PI3K is higher in virulent E . histolytica than in nonvirulent E . dispar ( 15 ) . Second , compared to mammalian cells , E . histolytica has above average levels of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 in the plasma membrane ( 10 ) . Third , unlike in mam - malian cells ( 16 ) , serum withdrawal does not affect the steady - state level of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 in E . histolytica ( 10 ) . Fourth , the products of PI3K , PI3P and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , localize to early - forming or newly Received 13 December 2013 Accepted 12 January 2014 Published ahead of print 17 January 2014 Address correspondence to Lesly A .

In contrast , localization of PI3P to phagosomes in mammalian cells is observed only after their clo - sure ( 17 ) . Finally , although not much is known about encystation in E . histolytica , wortmannin inhibits encystation in a related rep - tilian pathogen , E . invadens ( 18 ) . Therefore , it is possible that E . histolytica encystation also requires PI3K activity . Thus , under - standing the unique role of phosphoinositides and PI3K signaling in E . histolytica may provide insight into infection . In other systems , genomewide overexpression has been used to identify targets of small - molecule drugs . For example , Butcher et al . ( 19 ) used overexpression to identify genes regulating rapamy - cin sensitivity and , hence , TOR kinase signaling . Similarly , genomewide overexpression was used to deﬁne targets of a kinase inhibitor , phenylaminopyrimidine ( 20 ) , and two antifungal drugs , tunicamycin and soraphen ( 21 ) . Sequencing and annota - tion of the E . histolytica genome ( 22 , 23 ) have enabled the devel - opment of whole - genome approaches to assign functions to genes . However , to date , the only forward genetics approach that has been applied to E . histolytica is a recent overexpression screen that identiﬁed genes that negatively regulate phagocytosis ( 24 ) . In the current study , we have adapted an overexpression - based chemical genomic approach ( 25 ) to uncover genes that may di - rectly or indirectly participate in PI3K signaling . Speciﬁcally , we applied a near - lethal dose of wortmannin to a population of cells that had been transfected with an E . histolytica cDNA library to select for cells that were less sensitive to the drug . We then identi - ﬁed the genes that were overexpressed in the survivors . The screen was based on the hypothesis that cells in which wortmannin tox - icity was genetically suppressed may be overexpressing genes that directly or indirectly play a role in PI3K signaling . MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains and culture conditions . Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites ( strain HM - 1 : 1MSS ) were cultured axenically in TYI - S - 33 medium ( 26 ) in 15 - ml glass screw - cap tubes at 37°C . The methods used to generate E . histolytica cell lines that overexpress a GFP - tagged pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain from mammalian Bruton’s tyrosine kinase ( GFP - PH Btk ) , EhLimA , or luciferase ( here referred to as Eh209 ) are described elsewhere ( 10 , 24 , 27 ) . The GFP - PH Btk and Eh209 transgenic cell lines were main - tained in TYI - S - 33 medium supplemented with 6 (cid:2) g / ml G418 and 15 (cid:2) g / ml hygromycin . Expression of GFP - PH Btk or luciferase was induced bytheadditionof5 (cid:2) g / mltetracyclinetotheculturemedium24hpriorto performing assays . The EhLimA - expressing cell line was maintained in a medium supplemented with 23 (cid:2) g / ml hygromycin , and the drug concen - tration was increased to 46 (cid:2) g / ml for 1 week prior to conducting experi - ments . The generation of a population of E . histolytica cells transfected with a cDNA library in the E . histolytica expression vector pAH - DEST is de - scribed elsewhere ( 24 ) . Brieﬂy , the cDNA library was constructed using InvitrogenCustomServices ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . RNAwasisolated from approximately 2 . 4 (cid:3) 10 7 trophozoites using TRIzol reagent ( Invit - rogen ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Poly ( A ) (cid:4) RNA was se - lected from 2 mg total RNA and used to generate a primary , uncut , 7 - fold normalized cDNA library directionally cloned into the Gateway - compat - ibleentryvectorpENTR222 ( f1 (cid:5) ) . Proprietary5 = cap - bindingtechnology was used to select and enrich for full - length clones . The ﬁnal titer of the ampliﬁed library was 3 . 9 (cid:3) 10 6 CFU / ml . Twenty - four random clones , with a minimum of 20 different genes , were analyzed for the presence of inserts . All 24 clones had inserts with an average size of 1 . 1 kb . TheLRClonasesystem ( Invitrogen ) wasusedtotransfercDNAinserts from pENTR222 to pAH - DEST ( 28 ) , a Gateway - compatible E . histolytica expression vector ( kind gift from C . A . Gilchrist and W . A . Petri , Jr . , Department of Medicine , Division of Infectious Diseases and Interna - tional Health , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA ) . This plasmid is episomal in nature and confers hygromycin resistance to transfectants . Expression from this plasmid is driven by upstream ferredoxin regulatory sequences . The cDNA library in pAH - DEST was transfected into HM1 : IMSS trophozoites using standard protocols ( 10 , 29 ) . Transfectants were maintained by the addition of 23 (cid:2) g / ml hygromycin to the medium . E . histolytica trophozoites were transfected with expression plasmids encoding SREHP or EhCoactosin using standard transfection protocols ( 10 , 29 ) . These 2nd - generation SREHP and EhCoactosin overexpressors were maintained in a medium supplemented with 23 (cid:2) g / ml hygromycin , and the drug concentration was increased to 46 (cid:2) g / ml for 1 week prior to conducting experiments . Measurement of wortmannin toxicity and chemical genomics screen . Log - phase trophozoites ( 6 (cid:3) 10 4 cells ) were seeded into 39 ml of TYI - S - 33mediumcontainingarangeofconcentrationsofwortmanninor its diluent , dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) , and grown for 3 days in 15 - ml glass screw - cap tubes at 37°C . Fresh TYI - S - 33 medium containing the drug or the diluent was supplied to the cells every 24 h over the course of treatment . Cell viability was measured by microscopy with Trypan blue exclusion . A near - lethal concentration of wortmannin ( 2 mM ) was ap - plied to the library of overexpressing trophozoites for 3 days with a me - dium change every 24 h . Isolation of episomes from survivors and sequencing . Total DNA was isolated from the population of cells that survived wortmannin selec - tion or from the parental population of cells not exposed to wortmannin ( control ) using the Wizard genomic DNA puriﬁcation kit ( Promega , Madison , WI ) . The isolated DNA was transformed into Escherichia coli ( XL10 Gold ; Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) by standard transformation proto - cols . The resulting ampicillin - resistant bacterial colonies were randomly chosen from each condition ( unselected control or wortmannin selec - tion ) , transferred to the wells of 96 - well plates containing LB medium supplemented with ampicillin ( 100 (cid:2) g / ml ) and glycerol ( 50 % , vol / vol ) , andstoredat (cid:5) 80°C . FrozensamplesweretransferredtotheArizonaState University BioDesign Institute ( Tempe , AZ ) for automated plasmid iso - lation and sequencing . Analysis of expression by quantitative real - time PCR ( RT - qPCR ) . Cell lines were grown to mid - log phase ( 3 (cid:3) 10 5 cells / ml ) . Total RNA was isolated from these cell lines with TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) , and 2 (cid:2) g of RNA was treated with DNase I for 30 min at 37°C . The cDNAs were synthesized with oligo ( dT ) and Superscript III reverse trans - criptase ( Invitrogen ) at 50°C for 2 h . Expression of SREHP or EhCoactosin transcripts was measured by RT - qPCR using the RT 2 SYBR green ﬂuor qPCR mastermix ( SABiosciences , Frederick , MD ) and the appropriate primers for SREHP ( forward primer , 5 = - GCTGCATCAAGTCCATTCATTG - 3 = ; reverse primer , 5 = - GATAGAA ATATTTATCCCAACTAAAGAC - 3 = ) and EhCoactosin ( forward primer , 5 = - TTAGTGAAGTTGCTGGCCCAGTTG - 3 = ; reverse primer , 5 = - GCAT CTTCCTTAAGGGCAGCTTTG - 3 = ) . Normalization of the levels of cDNA was carried out by comparing expression to that of a housekeep - ing gene , the small subunit rRNA ( ssRNA ) ( accession no . X61116 ) ( 30 ) ( forward primer , 5 = - AGGCGCGTAAATTACCCACTTTCG - 3 = ; reverse primer , 5 = - CACCAGACTTGCCCTCCAATTGAT - 3 = ) . Normalization ratios were calculated using the Pfafﬂ method ( 31 ) . At least two indepen - dent biological replicates were evaluated . For each cDNA , three technical replicates were performed and the values averaged . The efﬁciency of each primer pair was assessed by use of a dilution series . In all cases , efﬁciency values were (cid:2) 88 % and R 2 values were (cid:2) 0 . 935 . LY294002 and cycloheximide sensitivity assays . To test for LY294002 sensitivity , log - phasetrophozoites ( 2 (cid:3) 10 4 cells ) wereseededinto13mlof TYI - S - 33 medium containing 50 or 25 (cid:2) M LY294002 or an equivalent volume of DMSO ( diluent control ) and grown for 3 days in 15 - ml glass screw - cap tubes at 37°C . Fresh TYI - S - 33 medium containing the drug or the diluent was supplied to the cells every 24 h over the course of treat - ment . Cell viability was measured by microscopy with Trypan blue exclu - sion . Koushik et al . 402 ec . asm . org Eukaryotic Cell The cycloheximide sensitivity assay was employed as described previ - ously ( 24 ) . Brieﬂy , trophozoites ( 3 (cid:3) 10 4 cells ) were seeded into 13 ml of TYI - S - 33 medium supplemented with 100 nM cycloheximide or an equivalent volume of PBS ( diluent control ) and incubated at 37°C for 48 h . Cell viability was assessed by microscopy with Trypan blue exclusion . Whole - celllipidextractionandPI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 dotblots . Totallipidwas extracted from trophozoites according to the methods of Gray et al . ( 32 ) . Brieﬂy , 1 (cid:3) 10 6 cells were washed twice with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) . Lipids were precipitated with 5 ml of 0 . 5 M trichloroacetic acid ( TCA ) and centrifuged at 500 (cid:3) g for 5 min at 4°C . The pellets were washed with 3 ml of 5 % ( wt / vol ) TCA – 1 mM EDTA and centrifuged at 500 (cid:3) g for 5 min . To facilitate neutral lipid extraction , 3 ml of methanol - chloroform ( 2 : 1 ) was added to the pellets , and the mixture was vortexed 3 times over a period of 10 min at room temperature . The extracted lipids were centrifuged at 500 (cid:3) g for 5 min at 4°C . To facilitate acidic lipid extraction , 2 . 25 ml methanol - chloroform - 12 . 1N HCl ( 80 : 40 : 1 ) was added , and the mixture was vortexed 4 times during 15 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 500 (cid:3) g . The resulting supernatant was subjectedtoaphasesplitbytheadditionof750 (cid:2) lchloroformand1 . 35ml 0 . 1N HCl . The solution was centrifuged at 500 (cid:3) g for 5 min at 4°C . After centrifugation , theorganicphasewascollectedandvacuumdried , andthe pellets were used for lipid dot blot analysis . Lipids were spotted onto Hybond - C nitrocellulose membrane . The membrane was blocked in 1 . 5 % ( wt / vol ) fatty acid - free bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) at room temperature for 1 h and probed with mouse anti - PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 antibody ( 1 : 1 , 000 dilution ) ( Echelon Biosciences , Salt Lake City , UT ) followed by incubation with secondary antibody , i . e . , per - oxidase - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG ( 1 : 2 , 000 dilution ) ( Cappel ; ICN Pharmaceuticals , Costa Mesa , CA ) . Immunoblots were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system ( Pierce Biotechnology , Rockford , IL ) according to the manufacturer’s in - structions . Semiquantitativedensitometricanalysesofimmunoblotswere performed using ImageJ software ( version 1 . 42q ; U . S . National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) . Measurement of motility . Motility assays were carried out according to the methods of Zaki et al . ( 33 ) . Brieﬂy , 8 ml of complete TYI - S - 33 medium , supplemented with 0 . 75 % ( wt / vol ) agarose , was poured into 60 - mmpetridishesandallowedtosolidifyatroomtemperature . Atrough ( 2 by 30 mm ) was cut into the solidiﬁed medium to serve as the motility chamber . Trophozoites were incubated in serum - free media for 1 h at 37°C . Followingthisincubation , 5 (cid:3) 10 5 cellswereplacedinthetroughof the motility chamber . A coverslip ( 22 by 40 mm ) was placed over the trough , and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 3 h in 5 % CO 2 . After 3 h , images were captured using an LSM510 confocal microscope ( Carl Zeiss MicroImaging , Thornwood , NY ) . For each trial , at least 3 measurements of the distance between the trough and the leading edge of the population of cells were taken using Zeiss LSM510 image analysis software . Statistical analyses . All values are given as means (cid:6) standard devia - tions ( SD ) from at least 3 trials . To compare means , statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Instat V . 3 with a one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) and a Tukey - Kramer multiple - comparison test . To compare the composition of the gene set obtained before and after selec - tion , we used a statistical Z - test . In all cases , P values less than 0 . 001 ( * * * ) were considered highly statistically signiﬁcant , while P values less than 0 . 01 ( * * ) or 0 . 05 ( * ) were considered statistically signiﬁcant . In silico analyses . Structural and functional amino acid residues and domains in the EhCoactosin protein were identiﬁed using ExPASy ScanProsite ( 34 ) . Cartoon renderings of the EhCoactosin protein were generated using the MyDomains - Image Creator in ExPASy PROSITE . The Clustal W algorithm was used for comparison of coactosin protein sequences ( MacVector 9 . 0 ; MacVector , Cary , NC ) . RESULTS Development of chemical genomic screen to enrich for mutants hyposensitive to wortmannin . Wortmannin is a cell - permeant , small - molecule metabolite isolated from the fungus Talaromyces wortmanni ( 35 ) . In mammalian cells , wortmannin can irrevers - ibly inhibit PI3K at low nanomolar concentrations ( 7 ) . To evalu - ate wortmannin toxicity in E . histolytica , we exposed trophozoites to a range of concentrations of wortmannin over 3 days . In E . histolytica , PI3P and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 staining were eliminated by 60 nM ( 8 ) and 500 nM ( 10 ) wortmannin , respectively . Since we were interested in completely disabling PI3K , we tested a range of con - centrations from 500 nM ( data not shown ) to 4 mM wortmannin . To ensure the presence of active inhibitor , the spent medium was exchanged with fresh wortmannin - containing medium daily . The viability of the trophozoites was assessed and reported as a per - centage of untreated control cells . Near 100 % death of the tropho - zoite population was achieved with 2 mM ( (cid:7) 1 . 5 % viable after 3 days ) , 3 mM ( (cid:7) 0 . 9 % viable after 3 days ) , and 4 mM ( (cid:7) 0 . 5 % viable after 3 days ) wortmannin ( Fig . 1 ) . Furthermore , there was nostatisticallysigniﬁcantdifferencewhen2mMwortmannintox - icity was compared to that of higher doses . Cell viability was not signiﬁcantly affected by the diluent , DMSO ( Fig . 1 ) . This suggests that cell death was speciﬁc to the presence of wortmannin . To minimize off - target effects of wortmannin and to maximize the chances of identifying genes authentically connected to PI3K sig - naling , 2 mM wortmannin treatment was chosen for the chemical genomics screen . Screening with wortmannin identiﬁes genes that may func - tion in PI3K signaling . E . histolytica cells were transfected with a cDNA overexpression library constructed in the episomal , consti - tutive expression vector pAH - DEST ( 28 ) as described previously ( 24 ) . The transgenic population of cells was exposed to 2 mM wortmannin over a 3 - day period . The surviving cells were allowed to recover for a 48 - h period . Episomes from the surviving popu - lation were puriﬁed and ampliﬁed in E . coli . The cDNAs were identiﬁed by sequencing . As a control , episomes were also isolated and sequenced from the transgenic population of cells that was not subjected to this selection . Table 1 shows the identity and frequency of cDNAs isolated from trophozoites that survived se - lection compared to those recovered randomly from a population of overexpressing cells not subjected to selection . To determine if the set of genes enriched after selection was signiﬁcantly different FIG1 Wortmanninistoxicto E . histolytica . Trophozoites ( 2 (cid:3) 10 4 cells ) were exposed to a range of concentrations of wortmannin or its diluent , dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) , oranequivalentvolumeofmedia ( control ) andgrownfor 3 days . Cell viability was assessed and expressed as a percentage of untreated controlcells . Thedatarepresentthemeans (cid:6) SDfrom3trials ( * * * , P (cid:8) 0 . 001 ) .

The statistical difference between genes isolated by selection and those isolated randomly from a control population approached signiﬁcance ( P (cid:9) 0 . 05262 ) . This analysis suggests a nonfortuitous enrichment of speciﬁc genes by wortmannin treatment . The cDNA encoding an actin - binding protein with an actin depolymerization factor homology ( ADF - H ) domain ( EhCoactosin ; XM _ 645834 . 2 ) was the most highly enriched of the cDNAs . It was present in 14 . 4 % of the bacterial clones that had been transformed with episomes isolated from trophozoite survivors . The corre - sponding protein is predicted to be 148 amino acid long ( 16 . 2 kDa ) and was previously identiﬁed in a proteomic analysis of pu - riﬁed phagosomes from E . histolytica ( 36 ) . Like other coactosins , EhCoactosin belongs to the ADF / coﬁlin family of proteins and contains a putative F - actin binding domain . It is also predicted to possess a putative myristoylation , several casein kinase II sites , and proteinkinaseCphosphorylationsites ( Fig . 2A ) . Thesephosphor - ylation sites indicate a possible role for coactosin in cell signaling in E . histolytica . Coﬁlin , one of the founding members of the ADF / coﬁlinfamily , hasbeenshowntobeadownstreameffectorofPI3K activity ( 37 ) . However , to our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst study to reveal a functional connection between a coactosin - like protein and PI3K in any system . A sequence alignment revealed that EhCoactosin shares high homology with coactosins from other systems ( Fig . 2B ) . Impor - tantly , Lys 75 of human coactosin , which is required for interaction with F - actin , is conserved in EhCoactosin , suggesting that the E . histolytica protein is an authentic actin - binding protein . The 129 LKKAGG 134 sequence motif , speciﬁcally Lys 131 , on the C - ter - minal end of human coactosin is necessary for interaction with 5 - lipoxygenase ( 5 - LO ) , an enzyme that is involved in leukotriene biosynthesis ( 38 ) . Although E . histolytica does not appear to pos - sess 5 - LO - like proteins , EhCoactosin harbors a similar motif at its C terminus which may facilitate its interaction with other pro - teins . The cDNA encoding the serine - rich E . histolytica protein ( SREHP ; M80910 . 0 ) was present in 4 . 4 % of the bacterial clones that had been transfected with the episomes isolated from tropho - zoite survivors . It is proposed to be a cell surface receptor that facilitates host - parasite or parasite - parasite interaction through chemoattraction ( 39 ) . Its potential as a vaccine target has been established ( 40 ) . SREHP is a cell surface protein , a potential che - moattractant , and is itself phosphorylated . These are all hallmarks of signaling proteins . Thus , it was intriguing to isolate it in a screen for protein partners of PI3K signaling . The cDNA encoding a Ras family GTPase ( EhRap2 ; XM _ 646071 . 2 ) was isolated from 8 . 9 % of bacterial clones that had been transfected with episomes from trophozoite survivors . Rap GTPases are known to participate in PI3K signaling in other systems ( 41 , 42 ) , supporting the validity of our screen . Because of its known connection to PI3K signaling , we did not conduct ad - ditional studies with EhRap2 . The cDNA encoding the 40S ribo - somal protein S14 ( XM _ 648457 . 2 ) , the 60S ribosomal protein L10 ( XM _ 647007 . 2 ) , and the ehapt2 retrotransposable element ( AY141199 . 1 ) were isolated from 10 % , 7 . 8 % , and 13 . 3 % , respec - tively , of bacterial clones that had been transfected with episomes from trophozoite survivors . These genes also were not chosen for further study , because overexpression of ribosomal proteins or retrotransposons may have profound nonspeciﬁc effects on pro - tein synthesis and gene expression . Furthermore , several of the cDNAs encoding ribosomal proteins also were identiﬁed in the unselected control population ( Table 1 ) . Authentication of EhCoactosin and SREHP . EhCoactosin was selected for additional analysis , because it was the most abun - dant cDNA isolated in the screen and because it may be the ﬁrst coactosin - like protein to exhibit a functional connection to PI3K . SREHP was selected because of its potential as a signaling mole - cule and its importance as a vaccine target . Expression vectors encoding EhCoactosin and SREHP , isolated in the original screen , were transfected into wild - type trophozoites to construct 2nd - generation cell populations overexpressing these proteins . Over - expression of SREHP and EhCoactosin transcripts was conﬁrmed by RT - qPCR ( Fig . 3A and B ) . SREHP and EhCoactosin transcripts exhibited 3 . 6 - and 7 . 1 - fold higher abundance , respectively , in the 2nd - generation transgenic cell lines than in the parental controls ( Fig . 3A and B ) . To validate the isolation of EhCoactosin and SREHP in the screen , we exposed the 2nd - generation transgenic cell lines to se - lection with 1 mM and 2 mM wortmannin for 3 days and reas - sessed toxicity .

Koushik et al . 404 ec . asm . org Eukaryotic Cell mannin toxicity in another cell line overexpressing an irrelevant protein , EhLimA , fromthesamenonintegratingexpressionvector ( 24 ) . There was no signiﬁcant increase in the number of survivors after wortmannin treatment in the EhLimA - expressing popula - tion ( Fig . 4A ) . This suggests that the genetic suppression of wort - mannin toxicity by EhCoactosin or SREHP overexpression is gen - uine . If overexpression of EhCoactosin or SREHP authentically res - cues E . histolytica cells from wortmannin toxicity , it is conceivable that overexpression should also confer resistance to other PI3K inhibitors . To test this , we quantiﬁed viability in the 2nd - genera - tion cell lines exposed to 50 (cid:2) M LY294002 , a concentration known to strongly inhibit staining with a PI3P biosensor in E . histolytica ( 8 ) . Cells overexpressing SREHP exhibited reduced sensitivity to LY294002 toxicity ( Fig . 4B ) , supporting a functional connection between SREHP and PI3K signaling . However , over - expression of EhCoactosin did not protect cells from exposure to LY204002 at this concentration . One possibility was that our test with LY294002 was too stringent . Therefore , we assessed the via - bility of the EhCoactosin - expressing cell line after exposure to a lower concentration ( 25 (cid:2) M ) of LY294002 . In this case , we ob - served increased survival of the EhCoactosin - expressing cell line ( Fig . 4C ) compared to diluent - treated control cells . This corrob - orates the isolation of EhCoactosin in the original screen and in - dicates that expression of SREHP is more efﬁcient at protecting cells from LY294002 toxicity than expression of EhCoactosin . EhCoactosin or SREHP could represent false positives if their overexpression leads to a nonspeciﬁc multidrug - resistant pheno - type . To address this possibility , we examined the speciﬁcity of the response by testing the susceptibility of EhCoactosin - and SREHP - overexpressing cells to an unrelated small molecule , cy - cloheximide , as previously described ( 24 ) . There was no signiﬁ - cant difference in survival of the 2nd - generation transgenic and parental control cell lines ( Fig . 5 ) . This indicated that the isolation of EhCoactosin and SREHP from our original screen was not due to a multidrug resistance phenotype characterized by nonspeciﬁc extrusion of small molecules .

In other systems , increased expres - sion of coactosin correlates with enhanced cell motility ( 45 , 46 ) . Therefore , to verify EhCoactosin as an authentic coactosin family member , we performed a previously published under - agar motil - ity assay ( 47 ) on the 2nd - generation EhCoactosin overexpressors . EhCoactosin - overexpressing cells traveled a signiﬁcantly longer distance in a 3 - h time frame than untransfected control tropho - zoites ( Fig . 6 ) , suggesting that this protein , like other coactosins , has a cell migration function in E . histolytica . Alteration in the level of phosphatidylinositol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) - triphosphateaffectsexpressionofEhCoactosinandSREHP . We used an independent genetic test to afﬁrm the connections be - tween PI3K and EhCoactosin or SREHP . Previously , it was re - ported that a transgenic cell line overexpressing a GFP - tagged pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain , from mammalian Bruton’s tyrosine kinase ( GFP - PH Btk ) , exhibited reduced phagocytosis ( 10 ) , increased motility ( 10 ) , and decreased levels of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 48 ) . Since the levels of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 are tightly coor - dinated , we predicted that PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 abundance also was altered in this cell line . Thus , we measured the level of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 using a lipid dot blot analysis of whole - cell extracts from untransfected parent cells and the GFP - PH Btk cell line . Compared to untrans - fected trophozoites , GFP - PH Btk - expressing cells exhibited a 2 . 6 - fold increase in PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( Fig . 7A and B ) . To determine if the increaseinPI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 wasduetothepresenceofepisomalexpres - sion plasmids , we also measured PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 in a control cell line ( Eh209 ) expressing an irrelevant protein , luciferase , from the FIG 4 SREHP and EhCoactosin overexpressors are less susceptible to wortmannin and LY294002 toxicity . Transgenic trophozoites were exposed to 1 mM or 2 mM wortmannin ( A ) , 50 (cid:2) M LY294002 ( B ) , or 25 (cid:2) M LY294002 ( C ) for 3 days , after which viability was assessed .

The level of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 was not signiﬁcantly higher in the control transgenic cell line , suggest - ing that the quantity of this signaling lipid is authentically higher in GFP - PH Btk - expressing cells . Given that PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 is the prod - uct of PI3K , increased levels of this lipid may be the genetic equiv - alent of enhanced PI3K activity . Products of PI3K may propagate a signal by interacting with and phosphorylating downstream effector proteins ( reviewed in reference 7 ) . One outcome of signaling is changes in gene expres - sion ( 49 – 51 ) . Therefore , we measured the level of EhCoactosin and SREHP transcript in the GFP - PH Btk cell line to assess the impact of altered levels of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 48 ) and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( this study ) . Compared to wild - type cells , there was a 1 . 65 - fold increase in the abundance of SREHP transcript ( Fig . 8A ) and a 3 . 4 - fold increase in the abundance of EhCoactosin transcript ( Fig . 8B ) in cells expressing GFP - PH Btk . SREHP and EhCoactosin transcript levels were not signiﬁcantly higher in a control transgenic cell line expressing an irrelevant protein , luciferase ( Eh209 ) ( Fig . 8A and B ) . This indicated that the increase in SREHP and EhCoactosin transcripts in the GFP - PH Btk - expressing cells was not due to the presence of episomal DNA or the application of selection . These expression data support the connection between PI3K signaling and EhCoactosin and SREHP . DISCUSSION In this study , we utilized a functional genomics approach to iden - tify genes that may directly or indirectly function in the PI3K pathway in E . histolytica . We uncovered at least one gene , a Rap GTPase , that participates in PI3K signaling in other systems . Our study also identiﬁed several genes not previously identiﬁed as partners in PI3K signaling , including SREHP and a coactosin - like protein , EhCoactosin . A mutant cell line with an increased level of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , the product of PI3K activity , exhibited increased ex - pressionofSREHPandEhCoactosin . Thissupportsthefunctional connection between these proteins and PI3K in E . histolytica . The assignmentofSREHPandEhCoactosinaspartnersoperatingwithPI3Ksignalingisnovel . Although not examined in detail , the enrichment of the EhRap2 - coding gene in our screen was intriguing . E . histolytica possesses two Rap isoforms , EhRap1 and EhRap2 , which share over 91 % identity ( 52 ) . EhRap2 shares at least 60 % identity with Rap1 proteins from other systems and at least 50 % identity with Rap2 proteins from other systems . Like other Rap1 proteins ( 41 , 53 ) , EhRap2 localizes to phagosomes ( 54 ) . In platelets , PI3K can activate Rap1 ( 54 , 55 ) . In Dictyostelium discoideum , Rap1 interacts with the Ras - binding domain of PI3K to modulate cell polarity and pseudopod formation ( 42 ) . EhRap2 possesses all of the effec - tor binding domains and switch I and switch II regions ( data not shown ) that are necessary for interaction with PI3K ( reviewed in references 56 and 57 ) . Since , in E . histolytica , EhRap2 ( 54 ) , PI3K ( 36 ) , and the products of PI3K ( 8 – 10 ) localize to phagosomes , and since EhRap2 was highly enriched among the wortmannin - se - FIG7 GFP - PH Btk overexpressorsdisplayalteredPI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 levels . Phosphoi - nositides were extracted from whole - cell lysates , and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 levels were measured using dot blots with antibodies speciﬁc to PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . ( A ) A typical dotblotisshown . ( B ) BlotdensitieswereanalyzedbyImageJsoftware ( version 1 . 42q ) . The density for the untransfected wild type ( WT ) was arbitrarily set to 1 , and all other data are reported as a ratio to the WT . The data represent the means (cid:6) SD from 3 trials . PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 levels were higher in GFP - PH Btk - ex - pressing cells ( * , P (cid:8) 0 . 05 ) than in WT cells or in a control cell line expressing an irrelevant protein , luciferase ( Eh209 ) . FIG 8 GFP - PH Btk overexpressors possess increased levels of EhCoactosin and SREHP transcripts . RNA from untransfected ( wild type ; WT ) log - phase E . histolytica trophozoites , from a cell line expressing a GFP - tagged PH domain ( GFP - PH Btk ) , and from a cell line expressing an irrelevant protein , luciferase ( Eh209 ) , was used for qPCR analysis of expression . The ssRNA gene was used as a loading control . ( A ) SREHP was expressed in the GFP - PH Btk cell line at a level that was approximately 1 . 65 ( (cid:6) 0 . 07 ) - fold ( * * , P (cid:8) 0 . 01 ) higher than that inWTcells .

Neither SREHP nor EhCoactosin was expressed at a higher level in the control cell line ( Eh209 ) , suggesting that the increase seen in the GFP - PH Btk cell line was authentic . The data represent the means (cid:6) SD from (cid:2) 3 biological replicates . Screen for PI3 - Kinase Effectors in E . histolytica March 2014 Volume 13 Number 3 ec . asm . org 407 lected population ( this study ) , it is reasonable to hypothesize that similar local EhRap2 / PI3K associations exist . In our study , the cDNA encoding ehapt2 was also highly en - riched in the wortmannin - selected population . The genome of E . histolytica contains non - long terminal repeat ( non - LTR ) retro - transposons ( 58 , 59 ) . These include the long interspersed repeti - tive elements ( LINEs ) and the short interspersed repetitive ele - ments ( SINEs ) . Ehapt2 is a member of the EhSINE1 family of retrotransposable elements . Ehapt2 is present in the vicinity of protein - coding genes ( 60 ) and may inﬂuence the expression of such genes . Although Yadav et al . ( 61 ) reported that laboratory strains of E . histolytica may be retrotransposition incompatible , discerning the genomic position of ehapt2 in trophozoites that are less sensitive to wortmannin is necessary to fully understand the connection , if any , to PI3K signaling . Several hypothetical protein - coding genes were also isolated in our screen . One such protein , H644 ( XM _ 644144 . 2 ) , was previ - ously identiﬁed in a screen for negative regulators of phagocytosis ( 24 ) . Overexpression of H644 strongly reduced phagocytosis of human red blood cells by E . histolytica ( 24 ) . A second hypothetical protein ( XM _ 650280 . 2 ) contained an N - terminal Bin - Am - phiphysin - Rvs ( BAR ) superfamily domain and a C - terminal SH3 domain . BAR domain proteins are evolutionarily conserved and bind to the plasma membrane . Speciﬁcally , BAR domains induce , stabilize , or detect membrane curvatures and facilitate the inter - action between the plasma membrane and the underlying cyto - skeleton ( 62 ) . Interestingly , H644 possesses a signiﬁcant number of putative phosphorylation sites ( 24 ) , and many BAR domain - containing proteins possess SH3 domains ( 63 , 64 ) . Thus , these hypothetical proteins may be authentic signaling molecules , and their identiﬁcation in our screen may not be fortuitous . Several ribosomal protein - coding genes were highly enriched in our screen . These may or may not be authentic participants in PI3K signaling . In a screen of yeast deletion mutants for wortman - nin sensitivity , 119 of the 1 , 067 genes , including several ribosomal protein - coding genes , were functionally characterized to be in - volved in protein synthesis ( 25 ) . Therefore , it is possible that in our study , overexpression of ribosomal proteins has a direct or indirect connection to PI3K - based signaling . The most highly enriched cDNA in our screen was EhCoactosin . Coactosin , an F - actin binding protein , was ﬁrst isolated from the actin - myosin complex of Dictyostelium discoideum ( 45 ) . Subse - quently , coactosin - like proteins ( CLPs ) have been identiﬁed in other systems ( 46 , 65 , 66 ) . Coactosin contains an actin depo - lymerizing factor homology ( ADF - H ) domain , a structurally con - served motif that allows proteins to interact with actin and to remodel the actin cytoskeleton ( reviewed in reference 67 ) . In gen - eral , coactosins only bind F - actin ( 46 , 65 , 68 ) . With the exception of D . discoideum coactosin , which weakly interferes with barbed - end capping of actin ﬁlaments ( 68 ) , coactosins do not seem to promote actin ﬁlament elongation or disassembly . It has been suggested that , in vivo , coactosins regulate actin dynamics as a member of a complex with other proteins ( 69 ) . EhCoactosin pos - sesses an ADF - H domain ; however , it remains to be seen if it binds actin and if it has additional interacting protein partners . Coactosin has been implicated in cell motility . In D . discoi - deum , coactosin is concentrated in pseudopods ( 45 ) . In develop - ingchickembryos , coactosinisexpressedinmigratingneuralcrest cells ( 46 ) . Additionally , the levels of coactosin mRNA are higher in motile and migrating cells . For example , in D . discoideum , coac - tosin mRNA reaches a peak level in aggregating cells that are re - sponding chemotactically to cyclic AMP ( 45 ) . There is also evi - dence for local translation of coactosin mRNAs at cellular extensions in oculomotor nerves ( 46 ) and in the pseudopods of human metastatic tumor cells ( 70 ) . We showed that the level of EhCoactosin transcript is higher in the GFP - PH Btk overexpres - sors . Interestingly , this cell line also exhibits increased motility ( 10 ) . Furthermore , we demonstrated that overexpression of EhCoactosin is sufﬁcient to increase motility . Together , these data suggest that EhCoactosin is an authentic member of the coactosin family . Coactosin may also play a role in phagocytosis in lower eu - karyotes , as evidenced by its identiﬁcation in the proteome of puriﬁed phagosomes of D . discoideum ( 71 , 72 ) and E . histolytica ( 36 ) . PI3K itself also localizes to E . histolytica phagosomes ( 36 ) . The mechanism by which increased levels of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 lead to increased expression of EhCoactosin has not been discerned . However , given that both proteins localize to the same organelle , and given that EhCoactosin has several phosphorylation sites , it is possible that , in addition to regulating expression of EhCoactosin , PI3K also regulates activity of EhCoactosin by phosphorylation . It remains to be seen if EhCoactosin physically interacts with PI3K or its products . SREHP has also been implicated in E . histolytica phagocytosis . In particular , trophozoites can induce host cell apoptosis via caspase - 3 activation ( 73 ) . This is followed by preferential phago - cytosis of apoptotic cells over healthy cells ( 73 ) . SREHP is thought to be a cell surface receptor facilitating the binding and uptake of apoptotic host cells ( 44 ) . SREHP also undergoes posttranslational modiﬁcations , including phosphorylation , O - linked terminal N - acetylation , and acylation ( 39 ) . Given its subcellular localization , posttranslational modiﬁcations , and function as a receptor for apoptotic cells , it has been hypothesized to be involved in cell signaling ( 44 ) . In the current study , identiﬁcation of SREHP sup - ports its role in signal transduction , perhaps through a PI3K - me - diated pathway . Recently , we discovered that SREHP localizes to lipid rafts in E . histolytica ( data not shown ) . Lipid rafts are small cholesterol - and sphingolipid - rich membrane domains that regulate signaling , in - cluding PI3K signaling . In E . histolytica the PI3K substrate , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , is also enriched in rafts ( 47 ) . Although it remains to be seen if PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 is localized to rafts in E . histolytica , the connec - tion between SREHP and PI3K is strengthened by the fact that SREHP colocalizes with PI3K - based signaling lipids in rafts . It is conceivable that overexpression of PI3K itself would have protected the cells from near - lethal doses of a PI3K inhib - itor . However , we did not identify cDNAs encoding PI3Ks . There are several possible explanations for our inability to iso - late PI3K - encoding genes in this screen . First , the screen was not exhaustive . The cDNAs from only 96 E . coli transformants were sequenced . Therefore , it is possible that additional sequenc - ing will identify cDNAs encoding E . histolytica PI3Ks . The E . his - tolytica genome possesses at least 8 putative PI3Ks ( data not shown ) , but it remains to be seen which of these are authentic PI3Ks . Second , the screen may have been too stringent . Although the false - positive discovery rate would have increased , screening with lower concentrations of wortmannin may have revealed genes encoding authentic PI3Ks . This study enhances our knowledge of PI3K signaling in E . histolytica , which , in turn , provides insight into virulence . This Koushik et al . 408 ec . asm . org Eukaryotic Cell study also illustrates the utility of full - genome functional genetic screens in this parasite . Our screen was based on a simple pheno - type , cell viability . Predictably , future forward and reverse genetic screens , based on more complex phenotypes , are likely to lead to the functional annotation of many genes in this organism . This will , undoubtedly , reveal new targets for the development of vac - cines or therapies against E . histolytica infection . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank William A . Petri , Jr . , and Carol A .
