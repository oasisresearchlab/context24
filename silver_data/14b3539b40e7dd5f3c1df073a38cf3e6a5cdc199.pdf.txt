Modiﬁcation of force microscope probe tips by covalent linking of organic monolayers that terminate in well - deﬁned functional groups enables direct probing of molecular interac - tions and imaging with chemical sensitivity . This new chemical force microscopy technique has been used to probe adhesion and frictional forces between distinct chemical groups in organic and aqueous solvents . Contact mechanics provide a framework to model the adhesive forces and to estimate the number of interact - ing molecular groups . In general , measured adhesive and frictional forces follow trends expected from the strengths of the molecular interactions , although sol - vation also plays an important role . Knowledge of these forces provides a basis for rationally interpretable mapping of a variety of chemical functionalities and processes such as protonation and ionization . INTRODUCTION Intermolecular forces affect a variety of problems in condensed phases extend - ing from capillarity and lubrication ( 1 , 2 ) at macroscopic length scales , micelle and membrane self - assembly on the mesoscopic scale ( 3 ) , to molecular recogni - tion and protein folding at the nanoscale ( 4 ) . Understanding these phenomena , regardless of the length scale , requires detailed knowledge of the magnitude and range of intermolecular forces . Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) ( 5 ) is a pow - erful tool for probing intermolecular interactions because it can resolve forces 381 0084 - 6600 / 97 / 0801 - 0381 $ 08 . 00 P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 382 NOY , VEZENOV & LIEBER with piconewton sensitivity and has a spatial resolution of nanometers ( 6 ) . These features enable AFM to produce nanometer to micron scale images of , for example , topography , adhesion , friction , and compliance , and thus make AFM an essential characterization technique for ﬁelds ranging from materials science to biology . The ability to probe interfacial forces with nanometer - scale resolution is crit - ical to developing a molecular - level understanding of a variety of phenomena , including friction and boundary lubrication , adhesion and fracture at interfaces , double - layer forces , and colloid stability . Signiﬁcantly , the absolute force res - olution in AFM can be several orders of magnitude better than the weakest chemical bond ( 7 ) . This resolution suggests that it should be possible to probe individual molecular interactions , however , the speciﬁc chemical groups on a tip interacting with a surface are typically ill - deﬁned . In addition , the contact area of the tip on a surface can be quite large because of ﬁnite tip curvature and tip deformation resulting from surface forces ( 6 ) . Althoughforcemicroscopycanprovidenanoscaleinformationaboutfriction , adhesion , and compliance , it has not been able to probe directly the speciﬁc chemical groups that ultimately determine these phenomena at the molecular level . To overcome this inherent limitation of AFM , we introduced the concept of chemical modiﬁcation of probes to make them sensitive to speciﬁc molecular interactions . By utilizing chemically functionalized tips , force microscopy can be used to ( a ) probe forces between different molecular groups , ( b ) measure surface energetics on a nanometer scale , ( c ) determine pK values of the surface acid and base groups locally , and ( d ) map the spatial distribution of speciﬁc functionalgroupsandtheirionizationstate . Thisabilitytodiscriminatebetween chemically distinct functional groups has led us to name this variation of AFM chemical force microscopy ( CFM ) ( 8 ) . FORCE MICROSCOPY Instrumentation and Measurements A typical force microscope consists of an integrated cantilever - tip assembly in - teracting with the sample surface , a detector that measures the displacement of the cantilever , and feedback electronics to maintain a constant imaging pa - rameter such as tip - sample separation or force ( Figure 1 ) . The integrated cantilever - tip assemblies can have single or V - shaped beams ( 9 ) and normal spring constants , k z , in the range 0 . 01 – 100 N / m . The most popular and versa - tile detection scheme in AFM is optical lever deﬂection ( 10 ) . In this scheme , the vertical displacement due to normal forces and the lateral twist due to friction of the cantilever are measured using a quadrant photodiode ( 11 ) , as shown in Figure 1 . Force values are determined from the normal displacement , 1 z , or P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 CHEMICAL FORCE MICROSCOPY 383 Figure 1 Schematic drawing of the CFM setup . The sample rests on a piezoelectric x , y , z translator . A laser beam is reﬂected from the backside of the tip onto a photodiode to measure two types of tip - surface interactions . When the sample approaches , touches , and is withdrawn from the tip , the tip will move up and down in response to surface normal forces F z , resulting in the vertical deﬂection signal V z . The cantilever will also twist in response to friction forces (cid:6) F x , yielding the lateral deﬂection signal V x . The inset illustrates the chemically speciﬁc interactions between a Au - coated , CH 3 - terminated tip contacting a COOH - terminated region of a sample . tilt angle , 1(cid:18) , of the cantilever from its resting position . With an instrumental sensitivity on the order of 0 . 1 ˚ A , minimal forces in the range of 10 − 13 – 10 − 8 N ( depending on the cantilever stiffness ) can be measured . Hence , AFM can in principle measure molecular interactions ranging from weak van der Waals ( < 10 − 12 N ) to strong covalent ( 10 − 7 N ) bonds ( 3 ) . In practice , the displacement ( and corresponding force ) sensitivity is limited by thermally excited cantilever vibrations and by optical and electronic noise ( 7 ) . If the measurements are conducted in ambient air or liquids , the thermal noise is especially important . For example , cantilever quality factors drop from 10 3 – 10 5 in a vacuum to 10 0 – 10 2 in ﬂuids as a result of hydrodynamic damping . The thermal - noise - limited minimal force is then on the order of 1 – 20 pN at room temperature . P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 384 NOY , VEZENOV & LIEBER Figure 2 ( A ) Typical force - vs - sample z displacement curve . At large separations , no force is observed between tip and sample . At short distances , the van der Waals attraction will pull the tip abruptly into contact with the sample ( jump into contact point ) . After that , the deﬂection of the soft cantilever tracks the movement of the sample ( linear compliance regime ) . Hysteresis in the force between tip and sample is observed when the tip is withdrawn from the sample . The ﬁnite force necessary to pull the tip off the sample surface corresponds to the adhesive force between functional groups on the surfaces of the tip and sample . ( B ) The cycle in ( A ) is shown in terms of a schematic intermolecular potential between the tip - sample functional groups . Whenever the force gradient exceeds the cantilever spring constant , the system becomes mechanically unstable and cantilever jumps occur . In principle , the magnitude of intermolecular interactions can be assessed directly in an adhesion measurement ( Figure 2 ) . The adhesive interaction be - tween different functional groups is determined from force - versus - sample dis - placement ( F - D ) curves . In these measurements , the deﬂection of the cantilever is recorded during the sample approach - withdrawal cycle ( 12 ) . The observed cantilever deﬂection is converted into a force using the cantilever spring con - stant . The pull - off force determined from the jump in the sample retracting trace corresponds to the adhesion between functional groups on the tip and sample surfaces . The sphere - on - ﬂat tip - sample geometry of the AFM does not correspond to the interaction between two atoms ( Figure 1 ) , although the general features of the interaction potential are the same , that is , the potential has a minimum and increases nonlinearly from this minimum ( Figure 2 ) . Because of this nonlinear - ity , the cantilever experiences mechanical instabilities ( i . e . jumps into and out of contact with the sample surface ) whenever the tip - surface force gradient ex - ceeds the cantilever spring constant ( Figure 2 ) . The magnitude of the adhesion force , which corresponds to the jump out from the force minimum , is measured precisely in these experiments . Ideally , one would like to map the entire poten - tial , which is possible if the effective spring constant can be varied continuously , for example , by applying a variable external force to the tip ( 13 , 14 ) . P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 CHEMICAL FORCE MICROSCOPY 385 Related Techniques Direct experimental measurement of the interactions between molecules and molecular assemblies has been achieved using other techniques , including the surface forces apparatus ( SFA ) ( 15 – 18 ) , an elastomer lens - on - plate appara - tus ( 19 , 20 ) , colloidal probe microscope ( 21 , 22 ) , interfacial force microscope ( 23 ) , and optical tweezers ( 24 – 28 ) . The SFA has yielded considerable infor - mation about adhesion and friction between molecular assemblies , although these data are averaged over the large numbers of molecules contained within the approximately 1 - mm 2 probing area . Hence , it is difﬁcult to obtain truly microscopic information with this approach . In colloidal probe microscopy , the AFM cantilever is modiﬁed with a well - deﬁned micron - size sphere ( 21 ) . Since the probe radius is better deﬁned than that of sharper microfabricated tips , this approach has an advantage in noncontact experiments . This char - acteristic of the colloidal probes has been utilized in studies of double - layer interactions ( 21 , 22 , 29 ) . However , the large size of the probes used in SFA and colloidal probe microscopy precludes high - resolution mapping of the dis - tributions of these surface forces and the measurement of binding interactions between single pairs of biological molecules . MEASURING INTERACTIONS BETWEEN MOLECULAR ASSEMBLIES Tip Modiﬁcation with Functional Groups To probe rationally interactions between functional groups the tip must be modi - ﬁed with well - deﬁned molecular layers . This modiﬁcation can be accomplished by using monolayers of amphiphilic molecules adsorbed on the surface of the tip . Different types of interactions can in principle be studied by varying the head group of the amphiphile . For example , nonspeciﬁc adsorption has been used to study long - range forces between hydrophobic ( 30 , 31 ) and charged ( 32 ) surfaces . This approach is limited , however , because physisorbed layers are not very robust . Alternatively , stable molecular layers can be produced by covalently linking the molecular components to the tip and sample surfaces . We have reported a successful method for covalently modifying AFM tips ( 8 , 33 , 34 ) . This method involves self - assembly of monolayers ( SAMs ) of func - tionalized organic thiols onto the surfaces of Au - coated Si 3 N 4 tips ( Figure 3 ) . Stable , robust , andcrystallinemonolayersofalkylthiolsordisulﬁdescontaining a variety of terminal groups can be prepared readily ( 35 – 39 ) ; thus , it is pos - sible to conduct systematic studies of the interactions between basic chemical groups on the probe tip and similarly modiﬁed Au substrates . Covalent modi - ﬁcation of AFM probes with thiols and reactive silanes has also been reported P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 386 NOY , VEZENOV & LIEBER Figure 3 Scheme for chemical modiﬁcation of tips and sample substrates . Tips and substrates are ﬁrst coated with a thin layer of Au ( 50 – 100 nm ) and then , upon immersion in a solution of organic thiol , a dense SAM is formed on the Au surface . Similarly , cleaned Si or Si 3 N 4 tips can be derivatized with reactive silanes . The functional groups comprise the outermost surface of the crystalline SAM , and the tip - sample interaction can be ﬁne - tuned by varying the chemistry at the free SAM surfaces . The R in RSH and RSiCl 3 represents an organic alkyl chain that ends with a functional group X ( X D CH 3 , COOH , CH 2 OH , NH 2 , etc ) . by other groups , including studies of adhesion ( 40 – 46 ) , contact potential ( 47 ) , and surface topography ( 48 ) . Experimental Environment The environment in which surfaces interact can play a crucial role in deter - mining measured forces ( Figure 4 ) . To probe interactions determined solely by solid - surface free energies ( i . e . bare interactions ) , adhesion forces must be measured in ultrahigh vacuum . Force measurements carried out in ambient air are more difﬁcult to interpret since capillary forces ( 3 , 49 ) are usually 1 – 2 or - ders of magnitude higher than speciﬁc chemical interactions . Capillary forces will thus obscure relatively small differences in molecular forces between tip and sample functional groups . On the other hand , capillary condensation will emphasize the relative degree of wetability ( hydrophilicity ) and can be a basis for discriminating between hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups when imaging under ambient conditions ( 50 ) . Measurements performed in dry inert gas at - mosphere may approach the chemical sensitivity of bare molecular interactions ( 42 , 43 ) ; however , caution should be used in interpreting results obtained this P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 CHEMICAL FORCE MICROSCOPY 387 Figure 4 Comparison between force measurements in ultrahigh vacuum , liquids , and ambient air . Interactions under high vacuum conditions are determined by solid surface free energies ( A ) . Pulling apart the surfaces under liquid will result in their solvation upon separation . The magnitude of the adhesion force is deﬁned by solid - liquid surface free energies ( B ) . Experiments conducted under ambient conditions reﬂect wetability of the surfaces , since predominant interaction is the result of capillary forces ( C ) . way , because it is difﬁcult to exclude or account for the presence of adsorbed vapor on high - energy surfaces . The capillary effect can be eliminated by conducting experiments in liq - uid instead of air ( 51 , 52 ) . Adhesion force measurements with both surfaces immersed in liquid will reﬂect the interplay between surface free energies of solvated functional groups . Aqueous solution studies are especially important P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 388 NOY , VEZENOV & LIEBER because AFM is increasingly being used to probe biological systems ( 53 , 54 ) . Indeed , previous AFM studies have found that the images of biomolecules are highly dependent on adhesion forces ( 55 ) , which can be sensitive to solution pH and ionic strength ( 56 – 58 ) and surface composition ( 59 ) . It also should be possible to obtain a detailed understanding of these interactions from force microscopystudiesifthetip - surfacefunctionalityiscontrolled . Thisideaissup - ported by SFA and colloid probe microscopy studies of relatively well - deﬁned but large surfaces ( 29 , 60 – 62 ) and by recent CFM studies ( 34 , 63 – 65 ) . Probe Characterization and Calibration To obtain absolute force values and make direct comparisons among studies re - quires knowledge of the cantilever spring constants and tip radii . Several meth - ods have been reported for experimental calibration of normal spring constants ( 66 – 69 ) , k z . The spring constant can also be calculated for a given cantilever ge - ometry and material ( 70 – 72 ) . The Au - coated cantilevers used to prepare SAMs exhibit larger spring constants than do uncoated cantilevers ( 33 ) and must be calibrated to reduce uncertainties in the measured forces . The lateral spring constants , k (cid:18) , of cantilevers also can be determined experimentally ( 73 ) or de - rived using the corresponding normal spring constants through the cantilever geometry ( 33 , 70 , 71 , 74 ) . In addition , the sensitivity of the optical detector , which measures the cantilever displacement , must be calibrated to obtain abso - lute forces . The normal ( z ) sensitivity of the detector can be determined from the linear compliance region of the force curve when the tip is pushed against a stiff sample ( Figure 2 A ) . Noncontact methods have also been described ( 75 , 76 ) . The lateral sensitivity of the detector can be calibrated from atomic stick - slip friction loops ( 77 , 78 ) or by a noncontact method ( 79 ) . Alternatively , the lateral sensitivity of a detector also may be related to its normal sensitivity ( 75 , 80 , 81 ) . Finally , the tip radius is an important parameter to characterize , since it affects the contact area between the tip and sample , that is , the number of molecular contacts . Estimates of tip radii are obtained by inspection of electron microscopeimages ( 33 , 43 ) orbyproﬁlingsharpfeatures ( 82 – 86 ) , uniformlatex spheres ( 87 , 88 ) , or colloidal gold clusters ( 89 , 90 ) on the surface . ADHESION BETWEEN DISTINCT FUNCTIONAL GROUPS A number of CFM studies of the interactions between different chemical func - tional groups covalently linked to tips and samples have appeared ( Tables 1 and 2 ) since our initial report of CFM ( 8 ) . Adhesive forces between tips and substrates modiﬁed with SAMs terminating in CF 3 , CH 3 , OCH 3 , CH 2 Br , OH , COOH , COCH 3 , CONH 2 , and NH 2 groups have been measured in organic ( 8 , 33 , 44 , 91 ) and aqueous solvents ( 34 ) , and in inert dry atmosphere ( 42 , 43 ) .

Tips were coated with 40 nm of Au . b Adhesion force normalized by the tip radius , F / R , in N / m . The measured adhesive forces agree with predictions of the Johnson , Kendall , and Roberts ( JKR ) theory ( 92 ) , showing that the observed interactions can be linked directly to the surface free energy . Double - layer effects on adhesive forces have also been interpreted in terms of a modiﬁed JKR model that incor - porates electrostatic interactions ( 34 ) . Measurements in Gases Several studies of functional group interactions have been conducted in dry gases ( 42 , 43 ) and are summarized in Table 1 . The adhesive forces between tips and samples modiﬁed with SAMs that both terminate in hydrophobic groups are small ( 43 ) or undetectable within the resolution of reported experiments ( 42 ) . Observed adhesive forces are also small when one of the SAM surfaces termi - nates with hydrophobic groups and the other terminates with polar groups . In contrast , signiﬁcant adhesion is observed when both the tip and sample SAM surfaces terminate with hydrogen - bonding groups ( Table 1 , entries 1 , 4 – 7 ) . The relative magnitudes of the adhesive forces reﬂect the expected bond strengths , that is , COOH / NH 2 > COOH / COOH > NH 2 / NH 2 . Because the dry gases used in these studies do not preclude adsorption of water and other species on the SAMs , we believe that ultrahigh - vacuum studies will be needed to determine unambiguously the magnitudes of the bare molecular interactions .

To quantify the differences and uncertainties in the adhesive interactions be - tween different functional groups , however , it is necessary to record multiple force curves for each type of intermolecular interaction . Histograms of the ad - hesive force versus the number of times this force is observed typically exhibit Gaussian distributions ( Figure 6 ) and yield mean adhesion forces ( (cid:6) experi - mental uncertainty ) of 2 . 3 (cid:6) 0 . 8 , 1 . 0 (cid:6) 0 . 4 , and 0 . 3 (cid:6) 0 . 2 nN for interactions betweenCOOH / COOH , CH 3 / CH 3 , andCH 3 / COOHgroups , respectively . Since the mean values do not overlap , these chemically distinct functional groups may be differentiated by measuring the adhesion forces with a tip that terminates in a deﬁned functionality . The observed trend in the magnitudes of the adhesive P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 CHEMICAL FORCE MICROSCOPY 391 Figure 5 Representative F - D curves in ethanol recorded for COOH / COOH , CH 3 / CH 3 , and CH 3 / COOH tip - sample functionalization ( tip R (cid:24) 60 nm ) ( reproduced from Reference 33 ) . interactions between tip / sample functional groups , that is COOH / COOH > CH 3 / CH 3 > CH 3 / COOH , agrees with the qualitative expectation that inter - actions between hydrogen - bonding groups ( i . e . COOH ) will be greater than between non - hydrogen - bonding groups ( i . e . CH 3 ) . The forces observed in dry , inert gas between these and similar functional group combinations parallel our results in ethanol solvent ( 42 , 43 ) . When the solvent is chemically similar to the tip and sample terminal func - tional groups ( e . g . CH 3 groups in hexadecane or CH 2 OH groups in ethanol ) , P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 392 NOY , VEZENOV & LIEBER Figure 6 A histogram showing the number of times that a given adhesion force was observed in repetitive measurements using COOH - terminated samples and tips . The histogram represents approximately400tip - samplecontactsforonefunctionalizedtipinethanol ( adaptedfromReference 33 ) . the forces required to separate the tip and surface are small ( Table 2 , entries 11 and 18 ) . Cross - interactions between immiscible components were either very small ( e . g . CH 3 / COOH in ethanol ) or even repulsive ( e . g . CH 3 / CF 3 in ethanol ) . In contrast , when the solvent is immiscible with the functional groups that ter - minate the SAMs on the tip and sample , the adhesive forces are extremely large . Both van der Waals ( Table 2 , entries 9 and 10 ) and hydrophobic ( Table 2 , entries 25 and 26 ) interactions can be responsible for this latter behavior . Continuum and Microscopic Models JKR MODEL Adhesion data can be used to assess the energetics of the different intermolecular interactions and to estimate the absolute number of functional groups contributing to experimentally observed forces . This assessment re - quires consideration of the contact deformations between tip and surface . If no molecular forces are present , the tip will separate from the sample without adhesion ( Figure 7 , Hertz ) . In cases of observed adhesion , the JKR theory of adhesion mechanics ( 3 , 92 ) can be used to assess quantitatively the above two points . This model assumes contact range surface forces ( Figure 7 ) and predicts that the pull - off force , F ad , required to separate a tip of radius R from a planar P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 CHEMICAL FORCE MICROSCOPY 393 Figure 7 Deformation of a spherical tip on a ﬂat substrate at pull - off and corresponding force proﬁles according to contact mechanics models . surface will be given by F ad D 3 2 (cid:25) RW SMT ; 1 . where W SMT D γ SM C γ TM − γ ST 2 . is the thermodynamic work of adhesion for separating the sample and tip ; γ SM and γ TM are the surface free energies of the sample ( S ) and tip ( T ) , respectively , in contact with the medium M [ vacuum , vapor ( V ) or liquid ( L ) ] and γ ST is the interfacial free energy of the two contacting solid surfaces . Self - consistent calculations ( 93 ) indicate that deformations at this scale are unimportant , and thus F ad D 2 (cid:25) RW SMT : 3 . This formula is the well - known result of the Derjaguin , Muller & Toporov ( DMT ) theory ( 94 ) , which assumes ﬁnite – range surface forces and no defor - mation , that is , zero contact area at the moment when bonds between functional groups on the tip and sample rupture ( Figure 7 ) . The exact value of the numer - ical coefﬁcient in Equation 1 ( 3 / 2 vs 2 ) is beyond the experimental uncertainty ( width of adhesion force distribution plus errors in determination of k and R ; see Tables 1 and 2 ) , and both approaches have been used to derive surface free energies from adhesion data . However , even when the work of adhesion is given more accurately by the DMT expression , the surface proﬁle and contact area are better described by the JKR model ( 95 , 96 ) . Use of the JKR model to correlate adhesion force and surface free energy also allows for estimates of the number of interacting groups . P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 394 NOY , VEZENOV & LIEBER If the sample and tip bear identical functional groups ( e . g . CH 3 / CH 3 inter - actions ) , then γ ST D 0 and γ SL D γ TL , and Equation 2 simpliﬁes to W SMT D 2 γ , where γ corresponds to the free energy of the surface in equilibrium with vapor phase or solvent . Therefore , the solid - vapor or solid - liquid surface free energy should determine the adhesive force between tip and sample pairs modiﬁed with the same molecular groups . This approach can be checked by independently calculating the expected value of F ad for CH 3 - terminated surfaces and tips . Previous measurements of the contact angle ( CA ) of ethanol on CH 3 - terminated SAMs ( 37 ) yielded a value of γ D 2 . 5 mJ / m 2 . The value of F ad D 1 . 2 nN calculated using this value of γ and the experimentally determined tip radius agrees well with the measured value of 1 . 0 (cid:6) 0 . 4 nN . Thus this continuum approach provides a reasonable inter - pretation of microscopic CFM measurements . Additional veriﬁcation comes from experiments in several different solvents ( 44 ) . In this case , γ SL and , hence , F ad are directly proportional to γ LV cos ( CA ) . Plots extrapolated to zero adhesion force yield γ SV . We have used this approach and reported data for CH 3 - terminated SAMs ( 44 ) to obtain a value of γ SV , 22 (cid:6) 6 mJ / m 2 , in close agreement with the value of 19 . 3 mJ / m 2 reported by Bain et al ( 37 ) . Alternatively , this analysis can yield important information about the surface free energies in cases where conventional contact angle measurements fail to yield γ . In particular , contact angle measurements cannot be used to probe high free energy surfaces that are wet by most liquids . Adhesion measurements are free of this limitation , and moreover , high surface energies lead to larger ( easily measured ) forces . For COOH - terminated SAMs , CFM data yield a value of γ D 4 . 5 mJ / m 2 in ethanol . The interactions between hydrogen - bonding groups in inert gas atmosphere are of considerably larger magnitude than in ethanol ( Table 1 ) . It remains unclear , however , whether these latter values of γ SV are representative of true solid - surface free energies , since the amount of vapor adsorbate is ill - deﬁned . Solvation would reduce the observed γ SV . obs / , whereas capillary contribution would increase γ SV . obs / relative to the true value . Another unique application of CFM is in the determination of interfacial free energies , γ 12 , between two different solid surfaces . By ﬁrst determining γ values for homogeneous interactions , γ 12 can be determined using Equation 2 and relevant F ad values from experiment . Examples include the COOH / CH 3 pair in ethanol and the COOH / NH 2 pair in dry nitrogen . In the ﬁrst case , a small adhesion force is consistent with a high value of γ 12 ( 5 . 8 mJ / m 2 ) . In the second case , signiﬁcant attractive force apparently results from a large negative value of γ 12 ( − 518 mJ / m 2 ) . In short , this means that acid - base interactions across an interface are much stronger than is hydrogen bonding between acid or base separately , and that termination of a hydrogen - binding interface ( COOH ) with a non - hydrogen - binding ( CH 3 ) interface is unfavorable . P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 CHEMICAL FORCE MICROSCOPY 395 ROLEOFTHESOLVENT The role that solvation plays in these adhesion measure - ments can be probed further by using the Fowkes - van Oss - Chaudhury - Good ( FOCG ) surface tension component model ( 97 – 99 ) . In this model , the total surface tension of a polar system is separated into dispersion γ LW ( Lifshitz – van der Waals ) , Lewis acid γ C , and base γ − components : γ total D γ LW C γ AB ; 4 . where γ AB D 2 p γ C γ − . The work of adhesion between identical surfaces , S , immersed in liquid , L , then becomes W SLS D 2 γ SL D 2 h‡q γ LWL − q γ LWS · 2 C 2 ‡q γ C L γ − L C q γ C S γ − S − q γ C L γ − S − q γ C S γ − L ·i : 5 . With completely apolar surfaces , such as the CH 3 - terminated SAMs , the last three terms in Equation 5 are zero ( i . e . γ AB D γ C D γ − D 0 ) . The dispersion component of CH 3 - terminated SAMs determined from contact angle measure - ments with liquid hydrocarbons is 19 . 3 mJ / m 2 ( 37 ) . This value is essentially the same as the γ LW D 20 . 1 mJ / m 2 for ethanol ( 97 ) . Thus , the ﬁrst term in Equation 5 is also negligible , and the value of the adhesion force between two methyl sur - faces in ethanol is essentially a measure of the strength of the hydrogen - bonding interaction between ethanol molecules : W CH 3 = EtOH = CH 3 D 2 γ ABEtOH : 6 . From the total surface tension of ethanol ( 22 . 75 mJ / m 2 ) , we conclude that the CH 3 SAM / ethanol interfacial tension , γ CH 3 = EtOH , derived from force measure - ments should be γ CH 3 = EtOH (cid:25) γ ABEtOH D 2 : 65 mJ / m 2 . This value compares favorably with the 2 – 4 mJ / m 2 value determined from adhesion experiments ( Table 2 , entries 3 – 6 ) . Corroboration of this interpretation comes from com - parisons of the adhesion forces in ethanol and methanol , since these solvents have virtually identical surface tensions [ 22 . 75 and 22 . 61 mJ / m 2 , respectively ( 100 ) ] but different hydrogen bonding [ γ AB D 2 . 65 and 4 . 11 mJ / m 2 , respec - tively ( 97 ) ] . By exchanging solvents with the same tip and sample we found that forces between CH 3 groups in MeOH are consistently 1 . 5 – 2 times greater than those in EtOH , in agreement with the ratio of 1 . 6 between corresponding γ AB values . This model also predicts that adhesion measurements made in a nonpolar or monopolar solvent ( e . g . such that γ C D 0 ) with surface tension close to that of the CH 3 - terminated SAMs should be very small . Indeed , we observed in ethyl acetate ( γ D 23 . 9 mJ / m 2 ) that adhesion forces could not be deter - mined within the noise level of our experiment ( < 0 . 01 nN ) . Other examples P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 396 NOY , VEZENOV & LIEBER are ethyleneglycol ( EG ) and dimethylsulfoxide ( DMSO ) . These solvents have signiﬁcant acid - base components ( 19 and 4 mJ / m 2 , respectively ) and disper - sion contributions differing from that of the CH 3 - terminated SAM ( 29 and 36 mJ / m 2 , respectively ) ( 97 ) . Adhesive forces between methyl surfaces in EG are predicted ( Equations 4 and 5 ) to be greater than those in DMSO by a factor of 3 . 0 , whereas experiments yield a difference factor of 2 . 8 ( DV Vezenov , A Noy , CM Lieber , unpublished results ) . These data independently conﬁrm the validity of the FOCG approach for treating the interactions in solvents . Similarly , assuming that the γ LW component is approximately the same for both methyl - and acid - terminated SAMs , the work of adhesion between the other two possible functional group combinations in ethanol is given by : W COOH = EtOH = COOH D 2 γ AB COOH = EtOH 7 . W CH 3 = EtOH = COOH D γ ABCOOH = EtOH − 1γ ABCOOH = EtOH ; 8 . where γ COOH / EtOH represents interfacial free energy and 1γ ABCOOH = EtOH D γ ABCOOH − γ ABEtOH . This analysis suggests that the small magnitude of the adhesion force between CH 3 / COOH - terminated SAMs in ethanol results from the similarity in the hydrogen - bonding energetics for the COOH / EtOH system . NUMBER OF MOLECULAR CONTACTS The JKR model can also provide an es - timate of the number of molecular interactions contributing to the measured adhesive forces . The contact radius at pull - off , a , for surfaces terminating in the same functional groups is a D . 3 (cid:25)γ R 2 = K / 1 = 3 ; 9 . where K D ( 2 / 3 ) [ E = . 1 − (cid:23) 2 / ] is the effective elastic modulus of the tip and sample , E is the Young modulus , and (cid:23) is the Poisson ratio . The value of K can be approximated by the bulk value for Au [ 64 GPa ( 101 ) ] , since the thin SAMs do not signiﬁcantly change the elastic behavior of the tip material , that is , E Au = SAM D . E Au t Au C E SAM t SAM / = . t Au C t SAM / (cid:25) E Au , where t is the layer thickness . Equation 9 yields a D 1 . 0 nm and a contact area of 3 . 1 nm 2 for the CH 3 / CH 3 interaction in ethanol . Since the area occupied by a single functional group of close - packed thiolate SAMs on Au is 0 . 2 nm 2 ( 102 ) , this result corresponds to an interaction between only 15 molecules on the tip and sample . A similar analysis of the COOH / COOH data from ethanol shows that theadhesiveinteractionisdeterminedby25molecularcontacts . Ultimately , this analysis predicts that when the tip radius is reduced to R < 10 nm , the contact area at pull - off will correspond to the interaction between a single molecular pair . Measurements with ultrasharp tips could be used to test this prediction and the validity of using a continuum theory for microscopic measurements ; P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 CHEMICAL FORCE MICROSCOPY 397 however , disorder in the SAM on highly curved tips ( 103 ) may preclude the use of this approach in measuring interactions between single molecular pairs . Adhesion in Aqueous Solutions Water is another important medium for CFM experiments . The acid - base chem - istry of ionizable sites immobilized at interfaces spans several systems , such as colloids , micelles , polymers , polyelectrolytes , and biological macromolecules . The dissociation constants of the surface groups in these systems often differ from those of their monomer analogs in solution . Several factors contribute to these differences , including ( a ) a low dielectric permittivity of an adjacent hydrocarbon region , ( b ) fewer degrees of freedom for the immobilized species , ( c ) an excess electrostatic free energy of the supporting surface , and ( d ) changes in the solution dielectric constant in the vicinity of a charged surface ( 104 ) . The surface free energy depends on the ionization state of functional groups and reﬂects their degree of ionization . In principle , one can monitor this change in free energy by measuring contact angle versus pH : There is a large change in contact angle of the buffered droplet at a pH equal to the pK of the surface group ( 105 ) . Chemically modiﬁed AFM tips and samples can be used to probe directly the changes in solid - liquid surface free energies with pH . The surface charge induced by the dissociation of acidic and basic groups can be detected by monitoring the adhesive force with an AFM probe sensitive to electrostatic interactions . Variations in the sign and magnitude of the force will indicate changes in the surface charge , and an abrupt transition will occur at a pH (cid:25) pK of the functional group on the surface . ADHESION FORCE AND CONTACT ANGLE TITRATIONS Adhesion force values obtained at different solution pHs for tips and samples functionalized with aminopropyltriethoxysilane ( APTES ) SAMs terminating with amine groups show a sharp drop to zero ( indicating a repulsive interaction ) below a pH of 4 ( Figure 8 A ) . The decrease and elimination of an attractive force between the tip and sample is consistent with protonation of the amine groups on these two surfaces . Contact angle values measured using buffered solution droplets on this same surface ( Figure 8 B ) also show a sharp transition ( an increase in wetability ) as the droplet pH is reduced below 4 . 5 . An increase in wetability is expected when the surface becomes protonated . Hence , local force microscopy measurements using a modiﬁed probe tip and macroscopic wetting studies provide similar values for the pK of the surface amine groups in the APTES - derived SAMs . The AFM approach to determining local pKs has been termed force titration ( 34 ) . The apparent pKs obtained from force microscopy ( 3 . 9 ) and contact an - gle wetting ( 4 . 3 ) for the surface amine group are 6 – 7 pK units lower than P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 398 NOY , VEZENOV & LIEBER Figure 8 ( A ) Adhesion force between sample and tip functionalized with amino groups versus pH . ( B ) Negative cosines of the advancing ( (cid:14) ) and receding ( (cid:15) ) contact angles of phosphate buffer droplets on a sample modiﬁed with APTES as a function of pH ( reproduced from Reference 34 ) . bulk solution values ( 100 ) . Large shifts in dissociation constants observed for mixed acid – methyl monolayers were attributed to unfavorable solvation of the carboxylate anion at the monolayer interface ( 106 ) . Large pK shifts relative to solution were also observed in studies of amino groups grafted onto the surface of a hydrophobic polymer ( 107 ) . In addition , recent simulations of the titration of surface amine groups showed large negative shifts in pK when the amine was poorly solvated ( 108 ) . Since the interfacial tension in the alkylamine - water system is almost negligible ( < 0 . 1 mJ / m 2 ) ( 109 ) , the relatively high contact an - gles and large adhesion forces at pH > 4 observed in AFM experiments indicate that the APTES - derived monolayers are relatively hydrophobic . The hydropho - bic nature of the SAM likely arises from a partially disordered structure that exposes methylene groups at the surface . Hence , the large observed pK shift may be attributed to a hydrophobic environment surrounding the amine groups . P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 CHEMICAL FORCE MICROSCOPY 399 The ability to detect such pK changes locally by AFM should be of signiﬁcant utility in studies of biological and polymeric systems . FORCETITRATIONSONHYDROPHILICSURFACES The contact angle technique is limited to surfaces sufﬁciently hydrophobic that they are not wet completely in either nonionized or ionized states . In the case of high free energy surfaces , such as COOH - terminated SAMs , it is necessary to dilute the hydrophilic groups with a hydrophobic surface component and either pretreat the surface ( 106 ) or perform a contact angle experiment under a liquid ( versus vapor phase ) ( 110 ) . As our results on the APTES system demonstrate , the incorporation of a hydrophobic component must be done with considerable caution , since it can produce very large pK shifts . Such shifts in the pK a of surface COOH relative to bulk solution have been observed in cases of mixed COOH and CH 3 SAMs ( 106 , 110 ) . As a result , it has not been possible to determine the pK of a homogeneous COOH - terminated surface using the contact angle approach . Force titrations provide a direct measure of the solid - liquid interfacial free energy and thus bypass the above - mentioned limitations . A force titration curve obtained for a COOH - terminated sample and tip is shown in Figure 9 A . A prominent feature in this plot is the sharp transition from positive adhesion forces at low pH to zero ( indicating repulsion ) at high pH . The observed repul - sion at pH > 6 can be attributed to electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged carboxylate groups , while the adhesive interaction at low pH values originates from hydrogen bonding between uncharged COOH groups . The force - versus - separation curves become fully reversible and practically identi - cal at all pH values higher than 7 , indicating that the surface charge density is saturated under these conditions . Based on these data , we estimate that the pK a of the surface - conﬁned carboxylic acid is 5 . 5 (cid:6) 0 . 5 . This value lies within 0 . 75 pK units of the pK a for COOH functionality in aqueous solution ( 100 ) . The similarity of surface - conﬁned and solution pK a s indicates strongly that solva - tion effects do not play a signiﬁcant role in determining the ionization behavior of pure COOH - terminated SAMs . Control experiments with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups that do not dissociate in aqueous solutions do not display pH - dependent transi - tions . CFM titration curves for tip / sample SAMs terminating in OH / OH and CH 3 / CH 3 functionalities show an approximately constant , ﬁnite adhesive inter - action throughout the whole pH range studied ( Figure 9 B ) . The measured ad - hesion forces between CH 3 - terminated SAMs are typically 1 – 2 orders of mag - nitude larger than the forces observed for hydrophilic groups ( COOH and OH ) . This large difference shows the importance of hydrophobic forces in aqueous media and supports our conclusion that solvation effects are responsible for the P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 400 NOY , VEZENOV & LIEBER Figure9 Adhesionforcetitrationcurvesrecordedinbufferedsolutions . AdhesionforceversuspH for ( A ) COOH - COOH , ( B ) CH 3 - CH 3 ( ) andOH - OH ( d ) , and ( C ) COOH - OHcontacts ( reproduced from Reference 34 ) . anomalously high adhesion force ( and large shift in pK ) between the APTES monolayers . Finally , to probe pKs on unknown surfaces we suggest the use of functional - ized tips with SAMs that ( a ) do not exhibit a pH - dependent change in ionization and ( b ) are hydrophilic . The hydroxyl - terminated SAM meets these require - ments and has been used to determine the pK a of the carboxyl - terminated SAM , as shown in Figure 9 C . The dissociation constant is within 0 . 5 pK units of that determined using COOH - terminated SAMs on both sample and tip ( Figure 9 A ) . The slightly higher pK value is expected because the same magnitude of the P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 CHEMICAL FORCE MICROSCOPY 401 repulsive force is achieved at lower surface charge ( lower pH ) in the case of overlapping double layers ( COOH - COOH ) than in the case of a double layer interacting with a neutral , low - dielectric constant surface ( COOH - OH ) . MODELING THE CHARGED INTERFACE The JKR theory of contact mechanics provides a reasonable basis for understanding adhesion data in aqueous media . To interpret pH - dependent adhesion data in electrolyte solutions , one should also consider long - range electrostatic forces between the tip and sample sur - faces . Since the JKR theory is based on energy balance , one expects no adhesion ( Hertzian behavior ) when the free energy of a double layer per unit area w DL balances γ SL . Quantitatively , the pull - off force , P pull - off , is related to these two terms : P pull - off D − 3 2 (cid:25) RW SLS C 5 2 P DL ; 10 . whereP DL (cid:25) 2 (cid:25) Rw DL isanadditionalloadthathastobeappliedtoaspherically shaped tip because of the presence of a double layer . Thus , repulsion between like - charged surfaces ( P DL > 0 ) will decrease the magnitude of the pull - off force compared to that given by the JKR theory . There is a threshold value of the repulsive electrical double - layer force P DL D P pull - off , beyond which the deformation of a spherical tip should be fully reversible with a contact radius going monotonically to zero ( no pull - off force ) as the load is reduced . This result is equivalent to γ SL (cid:25) w DL . In other words , the attractive surface free energy component is canceled by the repulsive double - layer term . The corresponding surface potential 9 D s (cid:21) " " 0 γ SL 11 . is independent of the tip radius for (cid:21) (cid:28) R ( (cid:21) is the Debye length ) . Therefore , the change from adhesive to repulsive behavior is characteristic of the ionization state of the interacting surfaces and can be used to estimate the surface potential . From the above model , the surface free energies and surface potentials of hydrophilic SAMs can be calculated . The values of γ SL determined from ad - hesion data for OH - and COOH - ( fully protonated ) terminated surfaces were 8 (cid:6) 3 mJ / m 2 and 16 (cid:6) 4 mJ / m 2 , respectively . These values agree well with the values determined from interfacial tension measurements using two - phase sys - tems consisting of water and melts of either long - chain alcohols ( 7 – 8 mJ / m 2 ) ( 111 ) or carboxylic acids ( 10 – 11 mJ / m 2 ) ( 112 ) . The surface potential of the carboxylate SAM at pH > 6 and IS D 0 . 01 M , − 140 (cid:6) 20 mV , calculated from Equation 11 , is in reasonable agreement with an independent analysis of long - chain , fatty - acid monolayers at the air - water interface under the same condition ( 113 ) . This result can be substantiated further by analysis of F - D curves as discussed below .

PROBINGDOUBLE - LAYERFORCES The electrostatic origin of the pH - dependent repulsive forces can be veriﬁed by changing the Debye screening length (cid:21) , that is , the solution ionic strength . Figure 10 A shows that the repulsive interac - tion becomes progressively longer - ranged as the solution ionic strength , IS , decreases . A detailed analysis of the electrostatic force requires consideration of the surface charge – potential regulation imposed by the potential - dependent P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 CHEMICAL FORCE MICROSCOPY 403 bindingofH C andNa C ionsattheinterface . Surfacecharge – potentialregulation has been observed in colloidal probe microscopy investigations ( 114 , 115 ) , and this concept has been used in SFA studies to analyze double - layer interactions involving mica surfaces and 1 : 1 electrolytes ( 62 ) . Data in Figure 10 A were analyzed with a model that uses a linearized charge - potential regulation condition ( 116 ) . For carboxylate surfaces , the experimental data ( IS D 0 . 01 M ) was well - ﬁt down to separations of 1 nm . The condition of constantcharge ( versusconstantpotential ) wasapproachedintheseexperiments independentofionicstrength . Thevaluesofthescreeninglength , (cid:21) exp , extracted from experimental F - D curves agree well with the values calculated from the solution ionic strengths , (cid:21) cal ( Figure 10 B ) . Signiﬁcantly , the surface potential calculated using this analysis of the COOH - terminated surface at pH D 7 . 2 and 0 . 01 M ionic strength ( − 120 (cid:6) 5 mV ) is close to the value estimated from adhesion measurements . It may be possible to determine double - layer parameters of systems being imaged by simultaneously recording F - D curves , using a tip bearing a functional group with a predetermined ionization behavior . Figure 10 A also shows that the magnitude of the electrostatic force decreases for IS < 1 (cid:2) 10 − 2 M at small tip - sample separations . Equivalently , the values of P DL determined from the above ﬁts decrease for IS < 1 (cid:2) 10 − 2 M . In addition , adhesion can occur between surfaces despite the repulsive interaction . A plot of the measured adhesion force as a function of the electrostatic force , − P DL , is shown in Figure 10 C . This phenomenon is fully reversible : By varying the ionic strength one can go from pure repulsion at high ionic strengths to repulsion on approach and adhesion on separation at low ionic strengths . A decrease in ionic strength ( larger (cid:21) ) will diminish the double - layer repulsion ( Figure 10 A ) , which according to Equation 10 should result in a larger adhesion force as found in Figure 10 C . Finally , the number of species involved in double - layer interactions can be estimated . For a tip with a radius of 30 nm in contact with the sample surface in solution of 0 . 01 M ionic strength , more than 200 ions and 1 (cid:2) 10 5 water molecules are involved in the interaction . This observation contrasts the situa - tion in organic solvents where there are typically only 15 – 25 molecular contacts ( 33 ) . Thus , when using repulsive electrostatic forces in constant force imaging , one must remember that these forces are averaged over relatively large sample areas ( 117 – 119 ) . FRICTION MEASUREMENTS We ( 8 , 33 , 34 ) and others ( 42 ) have observed that microscopic friction and ad - hesive forces correlate with each other for organic monolayer systems . The friction force between functional groups on a sample surface and tip is usually P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 404 NOY , VEZENOV & LIEBER Figure 11 A typical friction loop recorded on a COOH - terminated sample using a COOH - modiﬁed tip in EtOH solution ( adapted from Reference 33 ) . determined by recording the lateral deﬂection of the cantilever as the sample is scanned in a forward - backward cycle along the direction perpendicular to the cantilever axis to produce a friction loop ( 120 ) ( Figure 11 ) . The externally ap - plied load is controlled independently through the cantilever normal deﬂection . The numerical values of the normal and lateral forces are determined using the cantileverspringconstants , andfrictioncoefﬁcientsareobtainedfromtheslopes of the corresponding friction - versus - load ( F - L ) curves . Another approach that utilizes a two - dimensional histogramming technique to produce F - L curves has also been proposed ( 75 , 121 – 123 ) . Chemical Effects in Friction In ambient conditions , it is difﬁcult to distinguish from other factors the true chemical contributions to friction . First , the large magnitude of capillary ad - hesion can produce normal loads drastically higher than the externally applied load . This increase in load results in large increases in contact areas and hence friction forces ( 122 ) . Second , ﬁlms of condensed vapor on surfaces can act as boundary lubricants and reduce friction between the surface and the AFM probe ( 122 , 124 ) . Both effects obscure true chemical interactions and can be eliminated by performing measurements either in liquids or ultrahigh vacuum . In addition , the generally uncontrolled surface functionality of Si and Si 3 N 4 tips ( i . e . SiOH density and varying degrees of contamination with hydrocar - bons ) indicates that well - deﬁned , modiﬁed tips are also needed to assess true chemical contributions to friction . Friction forces between tips and samples modiﬁed with different functional groups have been measured in ethanol ( 33 ) , water ( 34 ) , and dry argon ( 42 ) as a P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 CHEMICAL FORCE MICROSCOPY 405 Table 3 Frictional forces between functional groups Functional group Monolayer , Friction Tip radius No . pair ( tip - sample ) chain length Medium coefﬁcient Ref .

In these measurements , the friction forces increased linearly with the applied load . For a ﬁxed external load the absolute friction force decreased as COOH / COOH > CH 3 / CH 3 > COOH / CH 3 ( 33 , 42 ) , as shown in Figure 12 . The trend in the magnitude of friction forces and friction coefﬁcientsisthesameasthatobservedfortheadhesionforces : COOH / COOH - terminated tips and samples yield large friction and adhesion forces , while the COOH / CH 3 combination displays the lowest friction and adhesion . Thus a direct correlation exists between the friction and adhesion forces measured between well - deﬁned SAM surfaces . SFA studies of structurally similar layers also show that the friction force correlates with the force of adhesion ( 125 ) . In contrast , a better correlation with adhesion hysteresis and not the adhesion force was found in SFA studies of dissimilar phases ( i . e . crystalline , amorphous , and liquid - like ) of different hydrocarbon surfactants ( 15 – 18 ) . SINGLE ASPERITY CONTACTS The JKR model used to interpret the adhesion data predicts nonlinear dependence for friction versus load when a single spher - ical tip contacts a planar surface . Nonlinear behavior should be detectable in systems that exhibit a large adhesion , such as hydrophobic SAMs in water , at small or tensile loads . F - L data acquired for CH 3 - terminated SAMs in water ( Figure 13 ) show nonlinear dependence on applied load and are well - ﬁt to the contact area - vs - load dependence predicted by the JKR model ( 92 ) . These re - sults demonstrate that CFM probes the friction arising from interactions within a single asperity contact . This type of contact has also been reported for Si 3 N 4 P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 406 NOY , VEZENOV & LIEBER Figure 12 Summary of the friction force - versus - applied load data recorded for functionalized samples and tips terminating in COOH / COOH ( d ) , CH 3 / CH 3 ( ) , and COOH / CH 3 ( 1 ) in EtOH ( reproduced from Reference 33 ) . tips on mica ( 79 ) and siloxane - coated mica ( 126 ) , for monolayers of C 60 on GeS ( 127 ) , for Si tips on NaCl ( 121 ) , and for Pt - coated tips on mica ( 128 , 129 ) . IONIZABLE SURFACE GROUPS The change in ionization state of functional groups can also be detected by recording frictional forces at different pH . F - L curves for COOH - terminated tips and samples are linear but fall into two distinct categories : Larger friction forces and friction coefﬁcients are found in solutions at pH < 6 compared to pH > 6 ( Figure 14 ) . This cross - over in behavior occurs at the same region of pH where the normal forces exhibit a transition from attraction to repulsion . A ﬁnite load ( (cid:24) 4 nN ) is necessary to achieve nonzero friction at high pH . This is the load required to overcome the double - layer repulsion ( between charged surfaces ) and bring the tip into physical contact with the sample surface . Similar pH - dependent friction forces were reported for Si 3 N 4 tips on Si surfaces and were attributed to protonation - P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 CHEMICAL FORCE MICROSCOPY 407 Figure 13 Friction force - versus - applied load curve ( (cid:14) ) for a CH 3 - terminated tip and sample in water . The concave shape of the curve is consistent with the nonlinear dependence of the contact area on external load predicted by the JKR model ( — ) . deprotonation of tip / sample SiOH groups ( 130 ) . Although this hypothesis is reasonable , we believe that the acid - base behavior of the SAMs is much better deﬁned and hence amenable to more detailed understanding ( e . g . the isoelectric point for SiOH groups is expected to be around pH D 2 , whereas the transition in friction force occurs near pH D 6 ) . The frictional behavior of tips and samples functionalized with ionizable and nonionizable SAMs can be summarized in plots of the friction coefﬁcient versus pH ( Figure 15 ) . The friction coefﬁcients determined for OH - and CH 3 - terminated SAMs ( not shown ) are independent of pH , as expected for neutral , nonionizable functional groups . In contrast , the friction coefﬁcients determined for cases in which one or both SAM surfaces terminate in carboxyl groups show signiﬁcant decreases at pH above the pK a of the surface COOH group . The friction coefﬁcients thus exhibit similar pH dependencies to those observed in adhesion measurements . These results suggest that the drop in friction co - efﬁcient with changes in pH can be associated with the ionization of surface groups . We also found that the magnitudes of the friction force and friction coefﬁcient for OH - terminated surfaces were the lowest of those investigated in aqueous P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 408 NOY , VEZENOV & LIEBER Figure 14 Friction force versus applied load curves for COOH - COOH functionalized samples and tips recorded at pH 2 . 2 ( t ) , 3 . 5 ( ) , 7 . 0 ( d ) and 9 . 3 ( ) ( reproduced from Reference 34 ) . solution . Analysis of F - L curves for CH 3 - terminated tip / sample combinations also yielded low friction coefﬁcients ( (cid:24) 0 . 3 ) ; however , for comparable tip radii the magnitude of the friction force was an order of magnitude greater ( (cid:24) 60 nN ) than for either COOH or OH functionalized surfaces . The large magnitude of the friction force between CH 3 surfaces in aqueous media originates from the large contact area between hydrophobic surfaces . Mechanical Properties of the SAMs Other monolayer properties can affect adhesive and frictional behavior of or - ganic layers . For example , studies of phase - segregated Langmuir - Blodgett ﬁlms have indicated that elasticity and crystallinity correlate with observed friction ( 131 ) and adhesion ( 132 ) . A chain - length dependence was observed for friction on silane SAMs on mica ( 126 ) and LB ﬁlms of saturated carboxylic acids ( 133 ) . This chain - length dependence may reﬂect structural differences in the various monolayers versus an intrinsic viscoelastic effect ( 126 ) . Our studies of adhesion between samples that have been modiﬁed with different P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 CHEMICAL FORCE MICROSCOPY 409 Figure 15 Friction coefﬁcient versus pH for COOH - COOH ( d ) , COOH - OH ( r ) , and OH - OH ( ) contacts ( reproduced from Reference 34 ) . chain - length SAMs , HS ( CH 2 ) n CH 3 ( n D 11 , 51 , 21 , 25 ) and tips modiﬁed with a single n D 15 SAM in methanol show only small differences as a func - tion of chain length ( tip R (cid:25) 20 nm ) : 0 . 53 (cid:6) 0 . 16 ( n D 11 ) , 0 . 57 (cid:6) 0 . 16 ( n D 15 ) , 0 . 47 (cid:6) 0 . 13 ( n D 21 ) and 0 . 45 (cid:6) 0 . 12 nN ( n D 25 ) . As a result , we believe that chemical effects dominate observed adhesive and frictional differences in structurally well - deﬁned systems . CHEMICALLY SENSITIVE IMAGING Achieving chemical sensitivity in scanning probe microscopy imaging has been a goal since the technique’s invention . Sensitivity to the surface composition combined with unparalleled resolution and the ability to image a diverse array of surfaces under a variety of conditions would make AFM an even more pow - erful scientiﬁc tool ; however , several key issues regarding this problem must be addressed . The contrast in AFM images originates from the interactions P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 410 NOY , VEZENOV & LIEBER between the probe tip and the surface . These interactions are dependent on surface chemistry , morphology , mechanical properties , and on the nature of the surrounding medium . In order for chemical contrast to dominate observed images , chemically speciﬁc forces must be identiﬁed and enhanced , and other forces reduced or eliminated . Once the origin of the chemical contrast is un - derstood , one can envision ﬁne - tuning the probe - surface interactions as a way of enhancing the imaging sensitivity and speciﬁcity . Lateral Force Imaging The results presented above show that chemical modiﬁcation of probe tips is often sufﬁcient to observe chemical sensitivity in normal and lateral forces . The observed differences in friction can be exploited to produce lateral force images of heterogeneous surfaces with predictable contrast ( 8 , 33 , 34 , 42 ) . Patterned SAMs of alkane thiols on Au surfaces present a convenient model system for such studies because they are readily prepared , can incorporate a variety of different terminal functionalities , and have similar mechanical properties regardless of the terminal functional group . In addition , patterned surfaces can be made relatively ﬂat , thus eliminating unwanted topographic contributions to lateral force images . Figure 16 A shows a topographical image of a photochemically patterned SAM ( 134 ) with 10 (cid:22) m (cid:2) 10 (cid:22) m square regions that terminate with COOH groups and repeat every 30 (cid:22) m in a regular pattern . The regions of the SAM surrounding these squares terminate with CH 3 groups . Topographical images failed to reveal this pattern since such surfaces exhibit almost ﬂat topography across the CH 3 - and COOH - terminated regions of the sample . Friction maps of these samples taken with different tip functionality readily show chemical information about the surfaces ( Figure 16 B , C ) . Friction maps recorded with COOH tips display high friction on the area of the sample that terminates in COOH groups , and low friction on the CH 3 - terminated regions . Images recorded with CH 3 tips exhibit a reversal in the friction contrast : Low friction is found in the area of the sample that contains the COOH - terminated SAM , and higher friction is observed in the surrounding CH 3 regions . As expected , this reversal in friction contrast is consistent with the F - L curves obtained on homogenous SAM samples and occurs only with changes in the probe tip functionality . The image resolution is not that of a single functional group but rather an ensemble of groups deﬁned by the tip contact area . More - over , in the images shown in Figure 16 , the resolution is limited by the photopat - terning method itself ( (cid:24) 200 nm ) . Employing a microcontact printing technique for pattern generation improves the resolution by a factor of 4 – 5 ( 50 ) . In addi - tion , a resolution on the order of 10 – 20 nm was achieved in a monolayer - bilayer COOH / CH 3 system with functionalized tips in dry argon atmosphere ( 42 ) .

The images were recorded with pH values of ( A ) 2 . 2 , ( B ) 4 . 8 , ( C ) 7 . 2 , and ( D ) 10 . 3 . Two particles are highlighted by arrows on image A and also can be seen in images C and D . Image size is ( 30 (cid:22) m (cid:2) 30 (cid:22) m ) . Light regions indicate high friction ; dark regions indicate low friction . A general approach for enhancing chemical sensitivity involves changing the solvent characteristics , such as composition ( 44 ) or pH ( 34 ) . The validity of this approach was demonstrated by mapping changes in functional group ion - ization states with varying solution pH values . Images of COOH / OH - patterned surfaces obtained with a COOH - terminated tip in different pH solutions show that the friction contrast between COOH / OH regions can be inverted reversibly and that the change in contrast occurs near the pK a of the surface carboxyl ( Figure 17 ) . The reversals in friction contrast presented above occur only with changes in the probe tip functionality or a change in the probe tip ionization state in both ethanol and aqueous solvents . These results demonstrate the chemical - sensitive imaging possible with speciﬁcally functionalized tips that we term chemical P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 CHEMICAL FORCE MICROSCOPY 413 force microscopy ( CFM ) . The approach is reproducible and may serve as a method for mapping more complex and chemically heterogeneous surfaces . Chemically modiﬁed tips have also been used in imaging patterned siloxane monolayers on Si ( 135 ) and single polymers adsorbed on latex spheres ( 136 ) . These reports claimed to achieve pseudo - height contrast dependent on the AFM tip functionality ; however , this contrast should be interpreted as a friction image with the tip scanned parallel to the cantilever axis of symmetry ( 70 , 137 ) . OTHER CONSIDERATIONS Differences in friction forces have been used to map different domains of phase - segregated LB ﬁlms ( 131 ) . The image contrast in these investigations , however , was believed to result from differences in the elastic properties of the domains and not from the chemical functional - ity at the ﬁlm surface . In systems where elasto - mechanical effects ( or dif - ferences resulting from them ) are eliminated , the chemical component of the tip - surface interaction can be the dominant one determining observed image contrast . Conversely , if the interfacial chemistry is the same , second - order effects ( e . g . elasto - mechanical ) can become dominant ( 133 ) . The conditions under which the imaging is performed are important , since dominant interactions depend on the media even for the same tip - surface sys - tem . Figure 18 shows lateral force images of a COOH / CH 3 pattern acquired in water and air using a CH 3 - functionalized tip . The friction contrast between COOH and CH 3 functional groups is relatively large in both images . In water , this pattern shows high friction on the CH 3 - terminated regions and low fric - tion over the COOH - terminated regions of the sample . This result is readily understood on the basis of the friction studies discussed above . The contrast reﬂects the dominant effect of hydrophobic forces that mask other chemical interactions . Thus imaging under water with hydrophobic CH 3 - terminated tips constitutes an approach to construct hydrophobicity maps of sample surfaces such as biomedical polymers . Images acquired in air exhibit friction contrast opposite to that obtained in aqueous solution . These images do not reﬂect chemical interactions directly , but rather are the result of large capillary forces between the sample and tip over the hydrophilic COOH - terminated areas of the surface that are wet more readily than CH 3 regions . The high friction on the hydrophilic patches of the surface is always observed in air regardless of whether the tip is bare Si 3 N 4 ( 50 ) coated with Au , or derivatized with COOH or CH 3 functional groups ( 33 ) . Although chemical modiﬁcation of the tips does not inﬂuence the contrast controlled by capillary forces , it can reduce the contact forces and thereby enhance imaging resolution . In fact , hydrophobic treatment of AFM probes to reduce capillary forces and enhance the image resolution is a well - known trick in the AFM community ( 44 , 48 , 138 ) .

The tapping mode AFM ( 139 ) method has achieved the greatest popularity . In tapping mode , a tip is vi - brated near the surface , so that it brieﬂy touches the surface on each oscillation . Changes in the oscillation amplitude are monitored by the feedback loop as the sample is rastered under the probe tip . Advantages of tapping mode over conventional contact mode are that ( a ) the tip - sample forces act on a shorter time scale and ( b ) lateral forces are almost completely eliminated . These ad - vantages , combined with the tapping mode’s ability to image in physiologically relevant media ( 140 ) , make it a suitable method for imaging soft polymer sur - faces and biological samples . In fact , tapping mode has been used successfully in imaging etched polymers ( 141 ) , cell surfaces ( 142 ) , microtubules ( 143 ) , chromatin ﬁbers ( 144 ) , proteins ( 145 ) , and DNA ( 146 ) . Phase detection in tap - ping mode ( 147 ) can also yield very high - resolution images . Phase detection involves measuring the phase lag between the drive signal and tip response . One can envision that bringing our CFM approach to tapping mode would enable nondestructive chemical mapping of delicate samples . Chemically het - erogeneous surfaces produced by microcontact printing of alkanethiols on Au are good model substrates for these studies ( 50 ) . Since they are prepared using thiols of equal lengths that differ only in the functionality of the terminal carbon , the samples are essentially ﬂat and the regions of different chemical functional - ity are expected to have similar elastic properties . Therefore , most of the struc - tural differences that can contribute to the contrast in the images are eliminated . Figure 19 B shows a tapping - mode phase image obtained with a COOH - terminated tip on a microstamped sample bearing a uniform box - within - a - box pattern of alternating methyl and carboxyl groups . The regions of different chemical composition are readily identiﬁable on the image , showing that phase - lag imaging is sensitive to differences in tip - sample interactions . Phase - image contrast correlates with that in the friction image of the same sample obtained with the same tip ( Figure 19 A ) : Light areas on friction images are dark areas on phase images ( i . e . greater friction and greater phase lag occur in the same re - gions ) . We have proposed that the phase contrast observed with soft cantilevers in liquids can be attributed in certain cases to differences in adhesion forces ( A Noy , CH Sanders , SS Wong , DV Vezenov , CM Lieber , unpublished results ) . When the tip functionality was switched to methyl , the phase - image con - trast inverted ( Figure 19 C ) . Moreover , when the medium was changed from ethanol to water the magnitude of the phase lag increased several fold , whereas no contrast reversal took place upon varying tip functionality . These latter results are also consistent with the adhesion - friction data discussed above .

P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 CHEMICAL FORCE MICROSCOPY 417 observation shows that phase - lag imaging is highly sensitive to the nature of the chemical interactions between the sample surface and the probe : Regions that interact more strongly produce greater phase lag ( darker areas ) , whereas re - gions with weaker interactions produce smaller phase lag ( lighter areas ) . These results demonstrate the potential of tapping mode for mapping functional group distributions in a predictable way . CONCLUSIONS Chemically modiﬁed tips produced by covalently linking molecules to force microscope probe tips may be used to measure and quantify adhesion and friction forces between the functional groups on a tip and sample . Adhesion studies between SAMs that terminate with hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic functional groups have shown that the interaction between these groups follows chemical intuition and can be interpreted using a surface tension component model . These adhesion forces agree well with forces predicted by the JKR theory of adhesive contact . This model also makes it possible to show that the contact area between sharp ( < 50 nm ) tips and the sample corresponds to an interaction between only 15 – 25 molecular pairs in organic solvent media , although the number of interacting species for charged surfaces in water is an order of magnitude greater . Analyses of available CFM data show that it is possible to determine surface free energies for organic surface - liquid and surface – inert gas interfaces , as well as solid - solid interfacial free energies that are not readily obtainable by contact angle measurements . A new method has also been developed to determine local pKs of surface ionizable functional groups through force titrations . The interactions observed between modiﬁed tip and sample surfaces in aqueous solutions also agree well with the predictions of double - layer and modiﬁed JKR models . These models have been used to extract surface free energies and double - layer parameters that are essential to understanding interactions in aqueous media . In addition , the friction forces between modiﬁed tips and samples were found to be chemically speciﬁc . The magnitudes of the friction forces follow the same trend as adhesion forces . Frictional forces between ionizable groups are also dependent on the ionization states of interacting functionalities . Speciﬁcally , the friction coefﬁcient for COOH - terminated surfaces decreases signiﬁcantly at a pH corresponding to the pK a determined from adhesion measurements . The predictable dependence of friction forces on the tip and sample function - ality is the basis for chemical force microscopy , in which lateral force images are interpreted in terms of the strength of adhesive and shear interactions be - tween functional groups . Thus , in conjunction with adhesion data , CFM can distinguish different functional group domains in organic and aqueous solvents . P1 : ARK / SDA / MKV P2 : SDA / PLB QC : SDA June 5 , 1997 12 : 24 Annual Reviews AR034 - 12 418 NOY , VEZENOV & LIEBER When present , hydrophobic effects dominate both adhesion and friction forces ; hence , lateral force images taken with hydrophobic tips in aqueous solutions can map hydrophobic regions on a sample . On hydrophilic surfaces , observed pH - dependent changes in friction forces of ionizable groups can be used to map surfaces terminating in hydrophilic functional groups and to deﬁne the ionization state as a function of pH . These studies open many opportunities for basic and applied research . A variety of intermolecular interactions can be studied using the CFM technique , and analysis of these data can provide basic thermodynamic information rele - vant to chemists and biologists . CFM imaging of systems such as polymers , biomolecules , and other materials could lead to new insights into the spatial dis - tribution of functional groups , hydrophobic versus hydrophilic domains , and / or improved resolution . Our approach of using force titrations to determine the local pK of acidic and basic groups may be applicable to probing the local electrostatic properties of protein surfaces in their native environments and the ionization of colloidal particles at the nanoscale . Studies using chemically modiﬁed tips should also provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of dissipative processes relevant to tribology .
