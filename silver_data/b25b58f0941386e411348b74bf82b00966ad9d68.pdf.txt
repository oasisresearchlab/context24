This study presents summarizes and analyzes the results of 100 experiments that used communication mode as an independent variable . The results suggest that use of a GSS improves decision quality , depth of analysis , equality of participation , and satisfaction over manual methods . Additionally , more detailed analysis suggests that task type , GSS type and the interaction of both have a moderating effect on adaptation and outcome factors . 1 . 0 Introduction Group Support Systems ( GSS ) have been studied for over a quarter century via case studies , surveys , and experiments . More than 90 % of the experimental studies have been conducted since 1990 . There have been several assessments of the empirical results . What have we learned from these studies ? What variables are important in determining whether GSS improves or harms the process and outcomes of group decision making ? In a previous paper [ 11 ] , we presented a description of what had been studied , and how , in 140 experiments on GSS , published in journal articles or conference proceedings to that date . Subsequently we have identified and coded some additional papers , and focused on analysis of the results of all these experiments . The objective of this paper is to provide the Group Support System researcher with an updated assessment of empirical results for communication mode . To do this we have reviewed the results of 163 published GSS experiments , and are reporting on the 100 experiments compared whicha face - to - face ( FtF ) communication mode to a mode employing a GSS . ( The remaining experiments compared different modes or conditions of use of GSS to one another , e . g . , varying the presence or absence of various tools or procedures , or varying group size or composition ) . These experiments contained a total of 456 hypotheses which looked at the impact of GSS vs . FtF communication on various dependent variables . In this paper , we will first briefly describe the methods of classification of communication modes that have been contrasted in laboratory studies of Group Support Systems , and the classification of outcomes . Next , we summarize the results of previously published meta - analyses and assessments . Then , we will look at whether the type of GSS seems to make any difference on outcomes , and also at the distributions of results for all GSS modes combined , compared to the non - supported FtF mode , for the major categories of dependent variables that have been studied . Next , we will drill down one more level and determine if task type has any moderating effects on outcomes . Finally , we will compare our analysis of GSS studies to the preceding ones and make recommendations for future research . Defining the Independent and Dependent Variables Communication mode is defined as the medium or media of communication used by the group . The various categories of these independent variables , and the number of hypotheses which used them in the 100 experiments which we coded , are shown in Table 1 . The most frequently employed mode in GSS experiments is synchronous ( decision room ) studies , or GDSS ( Group Decision Support Systems ) , in which group members are gathered at the same time and place ( generally , each with their own computer , though a few studies employed a DSS at a single computer , with group members gathered around it ) . In the Decision Room GSS mode , group members are able to combine communication via the computer system , and " face - to - face " mode , including non - verbal communication . 59 . 2 % of all the hypotheses comparing GSS to FtF modes , contrasted the Decision Room GSS with face - to - face mode without computer support . A second , " distributed " mode of GSS is same time / different place mode in which audio and / or video links may be used in addition to the GSS to tie together participants distributed in two or more locations . 9 . 6 % of hypotheses in GSS experiments have contrasted distributed GSS , alone or in combination with GSS in a single decision room , with FtF modes . All of these systems labeled " GSS " are primarily decision support rather than communication support systems ; they have features such as voting and statistical displays , and presume that at least some of the communication will be conducted via other media . Distinctions have been made in the literature about the degree of sophistication of the decision support features , e . g . , " level 1 " vs . " level 2 " systems [ 7 ] , but since many publications lack sufficient detail about system characteristics to reliably make this distinction , all GSS type systems have been put in the same categories . A different type of GSS that has been used in many studies is Computer - Mediated Communication ( CMC ) systems , sometimes called “GCSS , " or Group Communication Support Systems [ 20 , 21 ] . CMC systems , which include computer conferencing , email , and “chat " systems , are primarily oriented towards text based communication , though some also include decision support tools and / or digitized graphics . These systems may be used synchronously ( same time , generally different place ) or asynchronously ( anytime / anyplace ) . They restrict the participants to communication via computer only . In looking at the synchronous CMC systems , they differ greatly in features and screen layout . Despite the explosive growth of asynchronous CMC for group communication using the Internet , only 7 % of all the experimental hypotheses have focused on comparing this type of communication to traditional FtF group interaction . Categorizing Outcomes In order to assess the effects of the independent variable , communication mode , outcomes of group interaction were categorized following the framework developed by Fjermestad [ 10 ] ; ( see [ 11 ] for a more concise explanation ) . Briefly , the complete framework consists of four categories of variables : contextual or independent variables ; intervening variables ; group adaptation process ; and outcomes . Independent variables include characteristics of the particular technology ( GSS ) being used , of the group , and the task , environmental and organizational contexts . Intervening variables refer to meeting characteristics such as session length , number of sessions , and presence and role of a facilitator , which can change from session to session . The adaptation ( adaptive structuration ) or interaction process of the group includes such things as their level of effort , their attitude toward the GSS , and participation patterns . They are the variables that are controlled by the group on an individual or collective basis . Outcomes are the result of the interplay of the intervening factors and adaptation of the group with the contextual factors . These results or dependent variables include efficiency measures ( e . g . , calendar time to decision ) , effectiveness measures ( e . g . , decision quality ) , usability of the system and methods used , and subjective satisfaction measures . 2 . 0 Previous Meta - Analysis and Assessments In their seminal paper , Kraemer and King [ 14 ] highlight that group activities are economically necessary in a modern industrial society . They go on to suggest that in order for such a society to prosper there will be a need for individuals to collaborate , and that group support systems might help by providing new knowledge about the decision making process . Furthermore , they conclude with a research agenda : 1 . a detailed assessment of the success and failures of GSS use 2 . continued experimentation with GSS 3 . organizational studies and case analyses . Since the publication of Kraemer and King’s paper there have been over 250 publications [ 16 ] studying the effects of GSS . There have also been nine major meta - analyses and assessments of GSS outcomes . Dennis , George , Jessup , Nunamaker , & Vogel , 1988 Dennis , et . al . , [ 5 ] conducted the first systematic analysis of the GSS research effort . They included 24 studies in five general research categories : decision rooms , 10 studies ; computer - mediated - communication systems , four studies ; distributed versus decision rooms , three studies ; GSS processes , two studies ; and case studies , five studies . In general , Dennis , et . al . , [ 5 ] conclude that the findings are inconsistent across the studies . However , decision quality , solution satisfaction , and participation equality seem to be better in the GSS groups compared to the FtF groups . In three out of five groups using GSS , these groups took longer to reach their decision than did non - supported groups . The results for the other dependent variables were either too inconsistent or not studied in enough experiments to draw any conclusions . Pinsonneault & Kraemer , 1989 & 1990 ; Kraemer & Pinsonneault , 1989 Pinsonneault and Kraemer [ 20 , 21 ] provided the GSS research community with a detailed and 1060 - 3425 / 98 $ 10 . 00 ( C ) 1998 IEEE comprehensive framework from which to interpret the results of empirical analyses . Briefly , the framework consisted of the context , the process , task related outcomes , and group related outcomes . Next , their method of analysis consisted of determining whether the focus of the study was aimed at a decision process ( GDSS , level 2 ) or at providing communication ( GCSS , level 1 ) . Finally , 28 studies [ 21 ] were assessed to determine which ones found positive , negative or no relationship between the technology support ( GSS versus no - GSS ) and the major task related and group related outcomes . GDSS studies : The results of 12 studies suggest that GSS supported groups have increased decision quality and depth , more egalitarian participation , increased consensus , greater satisfaction with the decision and the process , more task oriented communication and clarifications efforts , take less time to reach a decision , and are dominated more by a few group members than non - supported or face - to - face groups . GCSS studies : The results of 16 studies suggest that GSS supported groups have an increased decision quality and depth , increased participation , and take longer to reach a decision in comparison to non - supported groups . In addition , these computer supported groups had more negative aspects associated with communication , cooperation , domination , and overall confidence than FtF groups . Benbasat , DeSanctis , & Nault , 1991 ; Benbasat & Nault , 1990 Benbasat , et . al . [ 2 , 4 ] examined 29 studies and concluded that , compared to non - supported groups , GSS use leads to improved decision quality and the generation of more alternatives , requires more time to make the decision , and has more equalized participation . The results on consensus are inconsistent as well as the evidence on satisfaction . Benbasat , et . al . noted that researchers were just starting to examine the conditions under which GSS use leads to successful decision making . These studies were investigating leadership , the role of facilitation and the effects of task type . Furthermore , there were few studies comparing distributed support versus face - to - face modes . McLeod , 1992 McLeod [ 17 ] included 13 studies which meet the following criteria : ( 1 ) independent variable was GSS versus manual support ; ( 2 ) the major dependent variables were studied ( decision time , quality , satisfaction , etc . ) ; and ( 3 ) the analysis of variance data were included . The results suggested that GSS groups were more task focused , had greater equality of participation , took longer to complete the decision task , had higher decision quality , lower levels of consensus and satisfaction than manually supported groups . Benbasat & Lim , 1993 Benbasat and Lim [ 3 ] focused on 31 experimental studies which compared GSS and non - GSS conditions as independent variables . Their results indicated that GSS had positive main effects on decision quality , number of alternatives , and equality of participation in comparison to non - GSS conditions . Negative results were found for consensus , solution and process satisfaction , and for time to reach a decision . In addition , Benbasat and Lim found that the effects were moderated by task complexity , group size , context , and technology variables . Groups working on tasks with lower complexity benefited from GSS use more than groups working on tasks with higher complexity . Larger group sizes achieved higher decision quality and greater satisfaction than smaller groups . Groups using a level 2 GSS had higher performance , satisfaction , and consensus than groups using a level 1 GSS . Pervan , 1994 Pervan [ 19 ] selected 95 studies from over 200 published papers for analysis of the impacts of GSS use . His results suggest that GSS use improves decision quality , depth of analysis , and participant , process and solution satisfaction . Decision time was greater for GSS groups than face - to - face groups . Results on consensus and influence equality were inconclusive . McGrath & Hollingshead , 1994 ; Hollingshead & McGrath , 1995 Hollingshead and McGrath [ 13 ] organized 50 articles into three temporal categories : single meeting ( 42 studies ) ; multiple meetings ( 4 studies ) ; and extended period of time ( 3 studies ) . The results suggest that computer supported groups had an increased level of participation equality , but a lower level of overall communication , than face - to - face groups . Computer supported groups took longer and had a higher degree of decision quality as well . In terms of consensus , computer supported groups were less likely to reach consensus , but if they did , it was higher than that for face - to - face groups . There were no differences found for satisfaction . Hollingshead and McGrath noticed that computer supported groups had a higher quality level on idea - generation tasks , whereas face - to - face groups had higher quality on intellective and negotiation tasks . Dennis , Haley , & Vandenberg , 1996 1060 - 3425 / 98 $ 10 . 00 ( C ) 1998 IEEE This is the most recent meta - analysis and it is based on 35 studies which met the following criteria [ 6 ] : 1 . independent variable communication mode , with levels GSS and verbal face - to - face 2 . groups meeting in the same room at the same time . The results suggest that decision quality , number of ideas and decision time are significantly higher in GSS groups than in face - to - face groups . No differences were observed for participant satisfaction . Dennis et . al . also analyzed the effects of group size and matching process to task . The results revealed that GSS use improved performance for larger groups , and like the results of Hollingshead and McGrath [ 13 ] , GSS groups working on idea - generation tasks have improved quality and quantity . Summary of Prior Meta - Analysis The composite results of meta - analysis suggest that decision quality , depth of analysis ( defined in many ways , i . e . as the number of ideas ) , participation , and participant satisfaction are improved by GSS over FtF methods . The other major observation is that GSS groups take longer than FtF groups to reach their decisions . The results for decision confidence , task focus , consensus , and solution and process satisfaction are inconclusive . 3 . 0 METHOD Fjermestad and Hiltz [ 11 ] prepared a bibliography of 163 papers representing 140 different studies . Since then , an additional 23 studies have been added to this list . All 163 studies were categorized as follows then put in a data base ( see [ 12 ] ) : (cid:1)(cid:2) Experiments by author : A superkey consisting of an author number and experiment number . (cid:1)(cid:2) Design : Experimental design type ( i . e . 2 X 1 ) . (cid:1)(cid:2) Independent Category : Independent variables grouped into 7 categories ( context ; group ; method ; process structure ; task ; task support ; and technology ) . (cid:1)(cid:2) Independent variables : Using the name employed by different authors yields 38 independent variables . (cid:1)(cid:2) Dependent Category : Represents 11 categories of dependent variables ( consensus ; effectiveness ; efficiency ; process gain , loss , & variables ; roles ; satisfaction ; structuration ; and usability ) . (cid:1)(cid:2) Dependent variables : Representing 295 dependent variables , before combining similar variables into categories . (cid:1)(cid:2) Effect : 4 categories of results ( 0 - no effects ; 1 - positive effects i . e . GSS > FtF ; 2 - negative effects i . e . FtF > GSS ; 3 - no measures ( no hypotheses were tested for a particular independent variable ) ; 4 - other effects i . e . interaction effects . (cid:1)(cid:2) Outcome : Represents 141 different outcomes from the experiments . For the purposes of this paper , the databases were joined to form one database consisting of 1391 independent - dependent variable pairings . Then , a query was created to select only those parings which had the independent variable “communication mode . ” The results yielded 456 pairings representing 26 combinations and 100 studies . The references for the 100 studies are available from the authors . 4 . 0 Results Following from the basic framework developed by Fjermestad and Hiltz [ 11 ] , we have organized the dependent variables categories as shown in Tables 2 and 3 . Adaptation Factors Table 2 shows the total number of hypotheses tested in all the GSS experiments which examined each of the types of variables classified as “Adaptation Factors . ” According to Adaptive Structuration Theory [ 8 , 9 , 22 , 23 , 24 ] , group outcomes are not determined by the effects of single elements ( such as technology and task characteristics ) , but by a complex and continuous process in which those elements are appropriated by the group . These factors have been relatively ignored in GSS experiments ; only recently have they been treated in a number of studies . The four dimensions of the construct have to do with how the system is transformed into rules of interaction and resources that are actually used : level of use , attitudes toward the GSS , level of consensus , and level of control . Structuration variables have been studied in only 11 instances ; attitude toward the system and degree of comfort with it , account for 8 of these hypotheses , with the other dimensions looked at very infrequently . The process variables have been examined 55 times . The most frequently studied ones are effects on participation equality and general influence ( 15 and 16 times , respectively ) . Process issues have only been studied 17 times . Experimenters have been relatively optimistic about how GSS would affect process : they have studied process gains more frequently ( 35 tests of hypotheses ) than process losses ( 27 ) or other process variables ( 57 ) . Within the category of process gains , the most 1060 - 3425 / 98 $ 10 . 00 ( C ) 1998 IEEE frequently studied phenomena have been effects on choice shifts ( also called “risky shift” studies , because of the generally observed tendency for groups to make more risky decisions than individuals ) , with 8 hypotheses tested . The hypothesis for tendency of GSS to increase the number of critical comments made by group members has been tested in only two occasions . The most frequently studied process losses are evaluation apprehension , flaming , and production blocking , with 6 - 9 hypotheses tested . Intermediate role outcomes is a relatively new category set of dependent measures [ 26 ] and have been studied in 8 instances . Leadership and leadership issues have been studied surprisingly in only 5 occurrences . Outcome Factors Of all the dependent variables studied it is natural that various aspects of group effectiveness have received the most attention ( 53 % of 300 total outcome factor measures ) . Aspects of decision quality , such as overall quality , idea quality , etc . have most frequently been measured . Surprisingly , creativity ( creativity is measured differently in contrast to counting the number of ideas generated - see [ 18 ] as an aspect of the quality of the group product has been studied very little , with only two tested hypotheses . Productivity ( 42 measures ) has often been measured in terms of the numbers of ideas , alternatives , or comments . Various dimensions of subjective satisfaction are next most studied after effectiveness ( 85 times , or 28 . 3 % of the hypotheses ) , including process satisfaction , decision satisfaction , general satisfaction , etc . Of the remaining outcome variables , efficiency ( 33 hypotheses ) is most often measured in terms of decision time . Consensus has been studied much less frequently ( 17 times ) than effectiveness or satisfaction . Finally , system usability as an outcome has been measured in a variety of ways . Results of Studies Comparing Communication Modes Tables 2 and 3 give counts and percentages for the results of the tests of the 456 hypotheses about differences between GSS modes and face - to - face group decision making . For most dependent variables , disappointingly , “no significant difference” is the modal result . Negative effects are more prevalent than positive effects with the except for effectiveness and structuration . For consensus , GSS had a negative effect in 41 . 7 % of the tests , compared to only 8 . 3 % positive outcomes . It is obvious that the relative lack of ability to reach consensus is a problem for groups using GSS . Process gains were less likely with GSS , as were outcomes categorized as “process issues” in Table 3 , while process losses were slightly more likely . Since GSS are generally intended specifically to increase process gains and decrease process losses , this is a most discouraging result . Comparisons Among GSS Communication Modes The results clearly show that positive results for hypotheses testing GSS versus FtF have occurred in only 27 . 5 % of the instances ( 113 out of 456 hypothesis ) . Table 1 shows the results by the specific type of GSS communication mode , using all dependent variables . The results , in general , show that CMC systems have yielded slightly more positive effects in contrast to GSS systems , 34 . 8 % and 32 . 6 % for CMC and GSS , respectively . Otherwise , there appears to be no substantial differences among the GSS decision room systems , the synchronous CMC systems , or the asynchronous CMC systems . Surprisingly , the relatively " poverty stricken " CMC system that we have labeled as " level 0 , " because they are restricted to the synchronous exchange of only a line or a few lines of communication , can be relatively effective for preference tasks in which the objective is to reach consensus . Though there are only a few studies on which the data in Table 1 are based , this result has been confirmed in a recent dissertation by Whitworth [ 25 ] , who restricted his groups to the exchange of numbers related to voting , without any text communication . If a group is motivated to reach consensus , perhaps a " rich " communication medium merely distracts them from this objective . If there is normative pressure to reach agreement , mere awareness of the positions of others is sufficient to generate agreement , without any discussion or any form of social - emotional interaction . These and some of the other results of this summary of findings cry out for a theory of GSS robust enough to explain WHY some of these results are occurring . Future research should not treat media as " black boxes , " but needs to be designed to test alternative explanations of why observed differences ( or non - differences ) are occurring . Comparisons Among Task Types Both Hollingshead and McGrath [ 13 ] and Dennis , et . al . [ 6 ] suggest task type can moderate the effect of a GSS . Table 4 also reflects those observations . GSS groups aggregated together have positive effects in 28 . 2 % of the hypothesis . When organized by task type , the percentage increases to 33 . 6 % for task type 2 ( idea generation ) and decreases to 20 . 3 % for task type 4 ( decision making or preference ) . Several unexpected results are also observable for CMC and task type 4 and GSS and task type 2 . By 1060 - 3425 / 98 $ 10 . 00 ( C ) 1998 IEEE looking at Table 4 , it is obvious that CMC systems are fairly effective when used with tasks requiring decision making ( 39 . 7 % ) . In all variations ( CMC Synch , CMC Asynch , CMC Combined ) positive effects are close to 40 . 0 % . Thus , results suggest that CMC is highly effective when used in decision making situations . Similarly , GSS when used with task type 2 have improved positive effects ( 33 . 6 % ) in comparison to GSS in general ( 28 . 2 % ) . 5 . 0 Conclusions Our objective was to present a detailed assessment of the empirical results for the effects of the independent variable communication mode , on the major dependent variables studied in group support system research . Overall , the results suggest that the research shows an overwhelming tendency to find " no significant differences " between unsupported face - to - face modes and the types of group support systems that have been studied thus far . Less than one - third of the findings , overall , support hypotheses that GSS use is better than face - to - face methods ( GSS > FtF ) . Somewhat more positive results are observable when CMC systems used for task type 4 and GSS task type 2 , are compared to face - to - face conditions . One possible explanation is that many experiments have used too few groups to achieve sufficient statistical power to discern positive effects that may occur . 33 % of the 100 experiments in this study have less than 7 groups per cell . Among those finding significant differences between FtF and GSS hypotheses , 70 % had 7 groups or more per cell , whereas among those reporting no significant differences , only 49 % had 7 groups or more per cell . The other explanation is that there is really is no overall discernible impact of communication mode on group process and outcomes . if this is the case , it has different implications for decision room vs . distributed GSS ' s . There would be no reason to expend the money and effort to add GSS to face to face meetings , where as " no difference " between FtF and distributed asynchronous CMC would mean that considerable time and money might be saved by avoiding the need for participants to travel long distances to meet , without sacrificing quality of the group ' s work . Similar to the observations made by Hollingshead and McGrath [ 13 ] and the results reported by Dennis , et . al . [ 6 ] , task type moderates GSS use . The results reported here suggest that GSS decision room technology has the highest probability of aiding groups performing idea generation tasks in comparison to other task types . This may be because idea generation benefits from independent cogitation , and does not require a great deal of agreement , or other forms of social - emotional interaction . CMC systems provide a less “rich” environment than do decision room GSS . Perhaps , the group members can have time to reflect and digest the decision alternatives before deciding on a final decision . This might help explain why CMC groups working on a decision task have more positive results . Based on 100 experiments which span 20 years of research , we observe a 27 . 5 % positive effect ( see Table 1 ) due to GSS use over face - to - face methods . We will set this limit as our benchmark for interpreting the detailed results on the dependent category variables . Then , the overall results on the categories of dependent variables ( Table 2 ) suggest that the use of a GSS has relatively greater impacts on effectiveness ( 36 . 9 % ) , process variables ( 25 . 9 ) , role outcomes ( 33 . 3 % ) , and structuration ( 66 . 6 % ) . Relatively negative impacts are associated with efficiency ( 86 . 7 % ) which is mostly decision time . GSS groups clearly tend to take longer to complete their tasks than do FtF groups . Using these results as the starting point for future research , our objective is to find ways to improve the design and use of GSS . Field studies tend to show that the use of GSS actually reduces meeting time , thus efficiency is improved . Our next question is , " How do these results compare with the pervious meta - analyses and assessments ? " In general , the results of this study agree with the previous results which would be expected , since many of them used a subset of the experiments included here . Computer support is more likely than not to improve decision quality , depth of analysis , equality of participation , and certain aspects of satisfaction . However , computer supported groups do require more time to reach their conclusions . The results are still inconclusive on decision confidence , consensus , task focus , and process and solution satisfaction . What Needs to be Studied ? Interacting social groups cannot function if they focus only on “goal” or " task " oriented activities ; they must also devote time and interactions to the social - emotional interactions which build cohesion and trust and thus provide the group with the resources that enable it to succeed . As Bales put it ( [ 1 ] , p . 8 ) , “The idealized interaction process would then be described as one of alternating emphasis on the two types of problems . When attention is give to the task , strains are created in the social and emotional relations of the members of the group , and attention then turns to the solution of these problems . So long as the group devotes its activity simply to social - emotional activity , however , the task is not getting done , and attention 1060 - 3425 / 98 $ 10 . 00 ( C ) 1998 IEEE would be expected to turn again to the task area . " Group Support Systems are built explicitly to provide task support . Text based computer - mediated communication is not as " rich " as face - to - face or multi - media interactions for social - emotional communication ( e . g . , positive , such as joking and showing satisfaction or rewarding others with attention and approval ; or negative , such as showing tension or hostility ) . Thus , it may be that overall we have " no difference " as the average group result in comparing face - to - face and GSS text based media because the tools help in the task oriented interactions , but groups have difficulty in CMC with the relative lack of social presence , particularly if they have little prior experience with the system and no history as a group [ 17 ] . Many recent studies are examining the effects of different GSS structures and tools , which is beyond the scope of this paper . But , clearly , those issues need to be addressed . Of particular interest is the open question of whether new GSS systems integrating the ease of use of the " point and click " web based interfaces and multi - media features will improve the functionality and usability of GSS systems , and thus increase the likelihood of positive outcomes in comparison to unsupported face to face groups . Based upon the results reported in this paper , it would make sense to investigate combined modes of communication and decision making . For example , on a more complex task that requires both idea generation and decision making , groups might be started in a decision room using face to face interaction to " get to know " one another . They might then use a decision room GSS to generate ideas . Then , using CMC , the groups could gather more information in order to assess different options and reach a solution to the problem . Several experiments like this are in progress ( e . g . , [ 18 ] . The results do tend to support a combined mode approach .
