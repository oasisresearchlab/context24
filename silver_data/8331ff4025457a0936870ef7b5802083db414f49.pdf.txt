However , 21 the brain mechanisms underlying these features remain largely unknown . In this study , we used event - related 22 functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to dissociate these mechanisms in a revised creative chunk de - 23 composition task in which participants were required to perform different types of chunk decomposition that 24 systematically varied in novelty and appropriateness . We found that novelty processing involved functional 25 areas for procedural memory ( caudate ) , mental rewarding ( substantia nigra , SN ) , and visual – spatial processing , 26 whereas appropriateness processing was mediated by areas for declarative memory ( hippocampus ) , emotional 27 arousal ( amygdala ) , and orthography recognition . These results indicate that non - declarative and declarative 28 memory systems may jointly contribute to the two fundamental features of creative thinking . 29 © 2015 Elsevier Inc .

Originality and appropriateness 40 have been considered as the two basic features of creative thinking . Al - 41 thoughthestudyoftheneurocognitivemechanismsofcreativethinking 42 has lasted more than a dozen years ( Dietrich and Kanso , 2010 ; Kounios 43 and Beeman , 2014 ) , the neural basis of the novelty and appropriateness 44 of creative thinking remains largely unknown . 45 Theoretically , the feature of novelty or appropriateness alone is not 46 suf ﬁ cient for identifying creativity . A truly random process will often 47 generate something that is merely novel , and an ordinary way of think - 48 ing will usually be appropriate for most of problem situations ( Runco 49 and Jaeger , 2012 ) . However , these two features are related to the origi - 50 nality and value aspects of a given creative thinking respectively and 51 could be mediated by different cognitive brain mechanisms . According 52 to the representation change theory , chunk decomposition can unlock 53 new possibilities for solving creative problems that appear impossible 54 ( Knoblichet al . , 1999 ; Ohlsson , 1984 , 1992 ) , makingitoneof thespecial 55 forms of creative thinking during insightful problem - solving . Similar 56 to the inverse process of chunking ( Miller , 1956 ) , chunk decomposi - 57 tion refers to decomposing familiar patterns into their component ele - 58 ments so that they can be regrouped in a meaningful manner . The 59 matchstick arithmetic problem was the task originally used to study 60 chunk decomposition . In this task , problem solvers were given a false 61 arithmetic statement , written using roman numerals ( e . g . , ‘ I ’ , ‘ II ’ and 62 ‘ IV ’ ) , operations ( ‘ + ’ and ‘ − ’ ) andanequalsign ( ‘ = ’ ) , andwererequired 63 to transform the statement into a true equation by moving only one 64 stick from one position to another within the pattern . It was found 65 that it was easy for the participants to transform the equation ‘ VI = 66 VII + I ’ to ‘ VII = VI + I ’ , whereas it was dif ﬁ cult for them to transform 67 the equation ‘ XI = III + III ’ to ‘ VI = III + III ’ . This was because ‘ VII ’ is a 68 relatively loose chunk that is composed of meaningful small chunks 69 ( ‘ V ’ and ‘ I ’ ) , whereas ‘ X ’ and ‘ V ’ are much tighter chunks ( Knoblich 70 et al . , 1999 ) . It has beendemonstrated that thevalidity ofchunkdecom - 71 position is a speci ﬁ c form of insightful problem - solving through behav - 72 ioral data such as solution rate and RTs ( Knoblich et al . , 1999 ; Ollinger 73 et al . , 2008 ) . Eye - tracking technology was used to describe the dynamic 74 process of chunk decomposition ( Knoblich et al . , 2001 ) . In addition , 75 lesion and transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) studies to in - 76 terferewith thefunctionof thetargetbrain areas , suchasthefocal dam - 77 age to the lateral frontal cortex ( Reverberi et al . , 2005 ) or the inhibition 78 of the left anterior temporal lobes ( ATL ) produced by the cathodal 79 stimulation ( decreased excitability ) ( Chi and Snyder , 2011 ) , have dem - 80 onstrated that a weakening of top - down control and related ordinary NeuroImage xxx ( 2015 ) xxx – xxx ⁎ Corresponding author at : Department of Psychology , College of Education , Capital Normal University , Beijing 100048 , China .

Studies have also found 94 that multiple factors of task dif ﬁ culty prevent problem solvers from 95 making insights during chunk decomposition , and the sources of dif ﬁ - 96 culty in a problem do not always combine in a simple additive fashion . 97 Rather , the dif ﬁ culty of a problem can reside in the interaction of partic - 98 ular sources of dif ﬁ culty . This interaction could be embodied by a ) the 99 extra activation in the anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) , which is likely 100 responsibleformonitoringandresolvingthecon ﬂ ictbetweenthehabit - 101 ual and novel perceptual models ( Wu et al . , 2013 ) , and b ) the enhanced 102 connections in the ventral and dorsal visual pathways , which may be 103 related to the need to re - organize the “ what ” and “ where ” of visualpro - 104 cessing ( Wu et al . , 2010 ) . 105 In short , as a speci ﬁ c form of insightful thinking , chunk decomposi - 106 tionhas been provento beassociated with specialperceptual , linguistic , 107 and executive processes that were apparently different from the ordi - 108 nary modes of thinking . However , the neurocognitive mechanisms 109 underlying the processing of novelty and appropriateness for insights 110 during chunk decomposition still remain unclear . Fortunately , the 111 chunk decomposition task permits the systematic manipulation of 112 both novelty and appropriateness in the experiment . For example , in 113 the matchstick arithmetic task , the novelty of chunk decomposition 114 could be manipulated by asking participants to perform the familiar , 115 chunk ( or sub - chunk ) level decomposition or the unfamiliar , element 116 level decomposition . In other words , to reorganize the number “ IV ” to 117 “ VI ” by moving the “ I ” from the left side to the right involves a familiar 118 strategy of chunk decomposition that occurs at the chunk ( “ I ” and “ V ” ) 119 level , whereasto reorganizethenumber “ IX ” to “ IV ” byremovingthe “ / ” 120 from “ X ” and re - joining it with the remaining “ \ ” involves an unfamiliar 121 strategy of chunk decomposition that occurs at the elemental level . The 122 appropriateness of chunk decomposition , however , is determined by 123 whether the obtained result is reasonable . Decomposition that leads 124 to a suitable or meaningful result could be regarded as an appropriate 125 solution , and decomposition that leads to an unsuitable or meaningless 126 result would be considered inappropriate . In the above - mentioned ex - 127 ample , we can de ﬁ ne the chunk decomposition that produces a true 128 Roman numerical ﬁ gure as an appropriate solution and one that pro - 129 duces a nonsense ﬁ gure as inappropriate ( Fig . 1 ) . 130 Similarly , in the Chinese character decomposition task , we can 131 also require people to translate a Chinese character into another by 132 removing some parts . Chinese characters are composed of radicals 133 ( sub - chunksthatmayconveyphoneticorsemanticinformationofchar - 134 acter ) , which , in turn , are composed of strokes ( basic elements that do 135 not carry any meaning ) . Character decomposition can occur at both 136 the radical and stroke levels . The radical - level decomposition is familiar 137 to individuals and can easily be applied in an ordinary way of thinking . 138 In contrast , stroke - level decomposition is often beyond ordinary think - 139 ing and is novel to people , with a low probability of success ( Luo et al . , 140 2006 ; Wu et al . , 2009 , 2013 ) . Theseproperties enabled usto manipulate 141 the “ novelty ” of chunk decomposition : radical - level chunk decomposi - 142 tion represents familiar processing , such as decomposing the character 143 “ 冷 ” ( leng , meaning cold ) into “ 令 ” ( ling , meaning to order ) and the 144 character “ 决 ” ( jue , meaning resolve ) into “ 夬 ” ( false character ) by re - 145 moving the radical “ 冫 ” , while stroke - level chunk decomposition is 146 novel , such as decomposing the character “ 汗 ” ( han , meaning sweat ) 147 into “ 汁 ” ( zhi , meaning liquid ) and the character “ 汪 ” ( wang , meaning 148 the state of water ) into “ 汢 ” ( false character ) by removing the stroke 149 “ 一 Q7 ” . This distinction was perfectly consistent with the chunk decompo - 150 sition hypothesis on insight problem - solving ( Knoblich et al . , 1999 ; 151 Ohlsson , 1984 , 1992 ) . The “ appropriateness ( or usefulness ) ” of chunk 152 decomposition depends on whether the decomposition resulted in 153 real characters . It is natural for individuals to evaluate a decomposition 154 that leads to another real character as appropriate , such as the decom - 155 position of the character “ 冷 ” ( leng ) into “ 令 ” ( ling ) and “ 汗 ” ( han ) 156 into “ 汁 ” ( zhi ) , and to evaluate a decomposition that leads to a false or 157 non - real character as inappropriate , such as the decomposition of the 158 character “ 决 ” ( jue ) into “ 夬 ” and “ 汪 ” ( wang ) into “ 汢 ” . 159 Thus , we are able to employ a 2 × 2 within - group design in this 160 study . The conditions were Familiar - Appropriate , Familiar - 161 Inappropriate , Novel - Appropriate and Novel - Inappropriate ( Fig . 2a ) . 162 We are able to ef ﬁ ciently manipulate the novelty and appropriateness 163 of each chunk decomposition task using this design . In this design , 164 both the processing of novelty and the processing of appropriateness 165 are related to the perception , operation , and evaluation of a speci ﬁ c 166 way for character decomposition , but the former is related to the famil - 167 iarity or novelty of the approach , whereas the latter is related to the 168 appropriateness or validity of the approach . The way to decompose 169 the target character was designed by the experimenter in advance , 170 and participants were asked to mentally perform the process of chunk 171 decomposition with the help of a hint that was provided to them . The 172 advantage of this design is that we can precisely observe the type of 173 chunk decomposition that we expect . The disadvantage of this ap - 174 proach , however , is that the participants simply perform the given 175 chunk decomposition procedure by following the hint that was ex - 176 plicitly presented to them . Although following a creative method of 177 problem - solving is not identical to generating a solution independently , 178 it involves similar processes ( Abraham , 2014 ; Kroger et al . , 2012 ) , in 179 particular , the cognitive restructuring that has been regarded as the 180 key component of insight ( Luo and Knoblich , 2007 ; Weisberg , 1995 ) . 181 Until now , no experimental result has directly illustrated the neural 182 correlates of novelty and appropriateness processing during creative 183 insight . We may ask the following questions on this issue . The ﬁ rst is 184 how dif ﬁ cult is it toprocessthe features of noveltyand appropriateness . 185 This can be indexed by the difference in response times ( RTs ) across 186 conditions and re ﬂ ect the readiness or priority that our cognitive - 187 brain system has set for processing such information . A second and 188 closely related question is how the factors of novelty and appropriate - 189 ness will differentially inhibit the activation of the default mode net - 190 work ( DMN ) . This can be related to task dif ﬁ culty and embody the 191 extent to which a given way of thinking deviates from habitual or 192 normal / skilled ways ( Mason et al . , 2007 ) . The third question to explore 193 is how the features of novelty and appropriateness differentially task 194 the functional areas that subserve the executive function and visual – 195 spatial processing , which are necessary for the cognitive restructuring Fig . 1 .

In addition , we also payclose attention 198 to two speci ﬁ c types of functional areas : One type encompasses the 199 memory - related regions including the basal ganglia and hippocampus , 200 which are important for forming novel response chunks ( Boyd et al . , 201 2009 ; Sakai et al . , 2003 ) and novel , task - related associations during 202 insight problem - solving ( Luo and Niki , 2003 ; Zhao et al . , 2013 ) , respec - 203 tively . The second type includes the motivation - and emotion - related 204 areas , suchasthemidbrain ( substantia nigra / VTA ) , whichhave been as - 205 sociated with feelings of reward during novelty processing ( Bunzeck 206 and Düzel , 2006 ; Düzel et al . , 2010 ) , and the amygdala , which mediates 207 the “ Aha ! ” feeling and subsequent memories during insight ( Q8 Ludmer 208 et al . , 2011 ; Zhao et al . , 2013 ) . In sum , given that there is still no empir - 209 ical study on this issue , the present study is exploratory in nature and 210 wantstoinvestigatehowthesefundamentalaspectsofinformationpro - 211 cessing , such as those related to memory or those related to emotion 212 and motivation , are differentially involved in the mental representation 213 of the novel and / or appropriate features in a creative thinking task . 214 Methods 215 Participants 216 Eighteen undergraduate or graduate students ( 7 females and 11 217 males , aged 20 – 26years old , meanage = 22 . 36years , all native Chinese 218 speakers ) recruited from the University of Science and Technology of 219 Beijing participated in this study as paid volunteers . All participants 220 were right handed , had normal or corrected - to - normal vision , and had 221 no history of neurological or psychiatric problems . Prior to the scanning 222 session , the participants signed informed consent forms , and the study 223 was approved by the institutional review board of Beijing Magnetic 224 Resonance Imaging Center for Brain Research . Three participants ( two 225 male and one female ) were excluded from the analysis because of ex - 226 cessive head motion during scanning . 227 Materials 228 The participants viewed 160 trials ( 40 × 4 = 160 , 40 trials per 229 condition ) in the formal scanning session . The 160 target char - 230 acters that were used as the to - be - decomposed chunk and the 80 real 231 characters ( 40 × 2 = 80 ) , which resulted from chunk decomposi - 232 tion in the Familiar - Appropriate and Novel - Appropriate conditions , 233 can be found in the Chinese dictionary ( Zhonghua da zidian , the latest 234 version was published in 2012 ) and represented the most frequently 235 used characters in daily life . In contrast , the 80 non - real characters 236 ( 40 × 2 = 80 ) , which resulted from the Familiar - Inappropriate and 237 Novel - Inappropriate conditions , cannot be found in the dictionary and 238 have not been used anywhere else . 239 Imaging procedure 240 The160 trials were equally divided into 4 runs , with a runconsisting 241 of 10 trials per condition . The presentation order of the trials was 242 randomized in each run , and the sequence of runs was balanced across 243 all participants . The duration of each run was 6 min and 50 s , and the 244 total time of the functional imaging was 27 min and 20 s . 245 The task paradigm was adopted from a previous study ( Wu et al . , 246 2013 ) . In each trial , the to - be - decomposed character ( target character ) 247 was presented along with the to - be - moved part on the screen for a 248 ﬁ xed duration of 5 s . During this period , participants were asked to 249 judge whether the decomposition was appropriate by pressing a re - 250 sponse key with the right index and middle ﬁ ngers ( a decomposition 251 was regarded as appropriate when it resulted in an existing real charac - 252 ter and as inappropriate when it resulted in a non - real character ) . A 253 cross - viewing stage that ranged from 4 to 5 s was presented between 254 two trials ( Fig . 2b ) . 255 Image acquisition 256 Data were acquired in the Beijing Magnetic Resonance Imaging 257 Center for Brain Research . The functional MRI ( fMRI ) scanning was 258 performed on a 3 . 0 T magnetic resonance scanner ( Siemens Version , 259 Erlangen , Germany ) using a standard radio frequency head coil . To re - 260 strict movement , the participant ' s head was ﬁ xed with plastic braces 261 and foam pads during the entire experiment . For functional imaging , 262 the whole - brain coverage of 33 axial slices was acquired with a T2 * - 263 weighted echo - planar imaging sequence based on the Blood Oxygena - 264 tion Level Dependent ( BOLD ) contrast with the following parameters : 265 TR = 2000 ms , TE = 30 ms , FOV = 192 mm × 192 mm , FA = 90° , 266 64 × 64 matrix , 33 slices , 3 . 5 mm thick , and voxel size = 267 3 . 0 mm × 3 . 0 mm × 3 . 5 mm . In addition , a high - resolution structural 268 T1 - weighted anatomical scan was acquired with a three - dimensional , 269 gradient - echo pulse sequence for each participant ( TR = 2600 ms , 270 TE = 3 . 02 ms , FOV = 256 mm × 256 mm , FA = 7° , 178 slices with 271 1 . 0 mm thickness , and voxel size = 1 . 0 × 1 . 0 × 1 . 0 mm ) . 272 Image analysis 273 Image preprocessing and statistical analyses were performed 274 using the SPM8 software package ( Statistical Parametric Mapping8 , Fig . 2 . a .

The task was to judge whether the target character continues to be a real character after removing the to - be - removed part . The character decomposition could occur at either the familiar , radical level or the novel , stroke level .

For preprocessing , the images for each subject were 277 corrected by slice - timing , realigned for head motion correction , spatial - 278 ly normalized into a standard echo planar imaging ( EPI ) template in the 279 Montreal Neurological Institute ( MNI ) space , and smoothed with an 8 - 280 mm Gaussian kernel full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) . 281 At the ﬁ rst level analysis , four key events were de ﬁ ned as correct 282 response trials in each condition . The ﬁ fth event was de ﬁ ned as aninac - 283 curate or a missed response trial in all conditions that were out of inter - 284 est . All events were time - locked at the onset of problem display . Five 285 separate regressors were created , and a general linear model was esti - 286 mated in SPM8 . Six covariates ( three rigid - body translations and three 287 rotationsthat resulted from realignment ) werealso included to account 288 for movement - related variability . Regionally speci ﬁ c condition effects 289 were tested using linear contrasts for each key event relative to the 290 baseline and for each participant . 291 The resulting contrast images from the ﬁ rst level were submitted 292 to a random - effects analysis for all participants . The hemodynamic ef - 293 fects of each event were assessed using a 2 × 2 full factorial analysis of 294 variance ( ANOVA ) with the factors Novelty ( Novel , Familiar ) and 295 Appropriateness ( Appropriate , Inappropriate ) . First , we calculated the 296 main effect of Novelty , the main effect of Appropriateness , and the 297 interaction between these two factors . Moreover , because signi ﬁ cantly 298 less deactivation in DMN was found in the main effect of Appropriate - 299 ness ( i . e . , in the contrast of “ Appropriate conditions N Inappropriate 300 conditions ” ) , whereas signi ﬁ cantly more deactivation in DMN was 301 found in the main effect of Novelty ( i . e . , in the contrast of “ Novel 302 conditions N Familiarconditions ” ) , we performedaconjunctionanalysis 303 of the Familiar N Novel contrast and the Appropriate N Inappropriate 304 contrast to identify brain regions of the DMN that might be associated 305 with both Familiarity and Appropriateness . A number of active regions 306 that were predicted by the study , including the caudate nucleus , 307 substantia nigra ( SN ) , hippocampus , amygdala , and anterior cingulate 308 cortex ( ACC ) , as well as regions involved in executive function , visual – 309 spatial processing , and the DMN Q9 ( vmPFC , PCC / precuneus ) , were select - 310 ed as ROIs to extract the percentage signal changes from the related 311 contrasts . 312 Forthewhole - brainanalyses , thecorrectionthresholdwasgenerally 313 set at p b 0 . 05 , Family - Wise Error ( FWE ) corrected , but the threshold 314 of p b 0 . 001 ( uncorrected ) was also used in the following two cases : 315 a ) for detecting the activations Q10 in the SN , hippocampus , and amygdala 316 that wereclearlyexpected inthestudy and b ) intheinteractionanalysis 317 where no super - threshold activation was found after FWE correction . 318 The activation clusters that involved more than 30 voxels were report - 319 ed . For the ROI analyses , ROIs were de ﬁ ned by superimposing the acti - 320 vated clusters on the mask that was de ﬁ ned in the WFU Pick Atlas 321 ( Version 3 . 0 , http : / / fmri . wfubmc . edu / software / PickAtlas ) , and the 322 percentage signal changes were extracted using MarsBar ( http : / / 323 marsbar . sourceforge . net ) . The percentage signal changes within the 324 ROIs were extracted for each condition separately for each participant 325 and were further averaged across all participants to produce a mean 326 percentage or grand average ﬁ nite impulse response ( FIR ) time course 327 that lasted for 26 s after the onset of the event . The percent signal 328 changes within the ROIs were extracted for display purposes , except 329 during analyses of the Novelty - by - Appropriateness interaction , where 330 we further calculated and compared the percent signal change of each 331 ROI to detect differences across the four experimental conditions . 332 Results 333 Behavioral results 334 For the mean reaction times , a 2 × 2 ANOVA revealed that the main 335 effectsofNovelty [ F ( 1 , 14 ) = 234 . 51 , p b 0 . 001 , η 2 = 0 . 94 ] andAppropri - 336 ateness [ F ( 1 , 14 ) = 37 . 17 , p b 0 . 001 , η 2 = 0 . 73 ] were signi ﬁ cant . The 337 interaction between these factors was not signi ﬁ cant [ F ( 1 , 14 ) = 0 . 94 , 338 p = 0 . 348 , η 2 = 0 . 06 ] . The participants spent more time in the Novel 339 compared with Familiar conditions and in the Inappropriate compared 340 with Appropriate conditions ( Fig . 3a ) . 341 In addition , examination of the correct rates revealed a signi ﬁ cant 342 main effect of Novelty [ F ( 1 , 14 ) = 52 . 94 , p b 0 . 001 , η 2 = 0 . 79 ] and a sig - 343 ni ﬁ cantinteraction [ F ( 1 , 14 ) = 16 . 38 , p b 0 . 005 , η 2 = 0 . 54 ] , but the main 344 effectof Appropriateness wasnot signi ﬁ cant [ F ( 1 , 14 ) = 2 . 28 , p = 0 . 154 , 345 η 2 = 0 . 14 ] . Post - hoc comparisons indicated that the participants per - 346 formed more correct responses in the Appropriate condition compared 347 with the Inappropriate condition at the Familiar levels [ F ( 1 , 14 ) = 6 . 38 , 348 p b 0 . 05 ] , but the participants performed more correct responses in the 349 Inappropriate condition compared with the Appropriate condition at 350 the Novel levels [ F ( 1 , 14 ) = 7 . 88 , p b 0 . 05 ] ( Fig . 3b ) . 351 Imaging results 352 Main effect of Novelty 353 ToassesstheeffectofNovelty , neuralactivitywasexaminedbycom - 354 paring the Novel and Familiar conditions ( Novel minus Familiar ) . 355 Increased neural activity was identi ﬁ ed in the caudate , SN , parietal lob - 356 ule ( BA7 / 40 ) , postcentral gyrus ( BA1 / 2 ) , as well as several frontal re - 357 gions ( BA6 / 8 / 9 / 45 / 46 ) . Decreased neural activity was identi ﬁ ed in the 358 cuneus ( BA19 ) , temporal gyrus ( BA20 / 21 / 22 ) , lateral parietal cortex 359 ( BA39 / 40 ) , insula ( BA13 ) , as well as certain regions of the DMN , such 360 as the medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) and precuneus ( Table 1 ) .

Decreased neural activity was identi ﬁ ed in the precentral , 371 postcentral ( BA2 / 4 ) , and frontal ( BA6 / 47 ) gyri ( Table 2 ) . 372 Interaction between Novelty and Appropriateness 373 The analysis revealed a Novelty - by - Appropriateness interaction in 374 the anterior cingulate cortex ( BA24 ) , hippocampus , amygdala , supe - 375 rior parietal lobule ( BA7 ) , as well as several frontal gyri ( BA8 / 9 / 46 ) 376 ( Table 3 ) .

The involvement of the caudate in novel processing implies 446 that the process of chunk decomposition could also be mediated by 447 the procedural memory system , similar to the process of chunking . 448 Given that the activation level of the caudate did not differ between 449 the Familiar - Appropriate and Familiar - Inappropriate conditions or be - 450 tween the Novel - Appropriate and Novel - Inappropriate conditions and 451 given that the Familiar - Inappropriate condition was more dif ﬁ cult 452 than the Familiar - Appropriate condition and the Novel - Inappropriate 453 was harder than the Novel - Appropriate condition according to the re - 454 sponse times , the caudate activation cannot be simply attributed to a 455 difference in task dif ﬁ culty between the novel and familiar ways of 456 chunk decomposition . 457 Similar to the activation in the caudate , the SN was also selectively 458 activated during the processing of novel chunk decomposition .

These results implied that novel methods 464 of chunk decomposition , regardless of the appropriateness , could carry 465 reward values . The involvement of the caudate and SN in Q12 novelty pro - 466 cessing is also consistent with the role of the dopaminergic system . 467 The function of this system is closely related to exploration and 468 novelty - seeking ( e . g . , DeYoung , 2013 ) , which could be generally essen - 469 tial for creativity ( Takeuchi et al . , 2010 ) . 470 The neural basisofappropriateprocessing in creative chunk decomposition 471 Brain regions that are generally associated with the processing of 472 appropriateness in chunk decomposition , regardless of novelty , includ - 473 ed the lateral parietal cortex and the temporal gyrus , which might be 474 responsible for the phonological and semantic processing that accom - 475 panies the recognition of newly generated real characters ( Booth 476 et al . , 2006 ; Cao et al . , 2013 ; Kuo et al . , 2004 ; Wu et al . , 2012 ; Xiao 477 et al . , 2005 ) . 478 The hippocampus and amygdala were found to be selectively in - 479 volvedin the appropriateprocessingfor thenovel wayof chunkdecom - 480 position . The role of the hippocampus could be related to the formation 481 of novel , task - related associations between the old nodes of knowledge 482 in insight problem - solving ( Luo and Niki , 2003 ; Zhao et al . , 2013 ) , such 483 as inconspicuous structure associations between the target and result 484 characters in this study . The role of the amygdala , however , could be 485 relatedtothe “ Aha ! ” experience accompaniedwiththeinducedpercep - 486 tual insight and may be related to the encoding of these experiences 487 into long - term memory ( Ludmer et al . , 2011 ) because it is a crucial 488 node in the emotion network that has been implicated in a variety of 489 emotional functions ( Kim and Hamann , 2007 ; Paton et al . , 2006 ; Sass 490 et al . , 2014 ) . 491 Interestingly , we found that for truly creative chunk decomposition 492 ( i . e . , the Novel - Appropriate condition ) , the novelty aspect was associat - 493 ed with the basal ganglia ( the caudate ) , whereas the appropriateness 494 aspect was associated with the MTL areas ( the hippocampus ) . The 495 dissociated participation of episodic or procedural memory systems in 496 appropriate or novel processing might be related to how this informa - 497 tion was perceived and treated . Appropriateness relates to the most 498 meaningful aspect of creative problem - solving in accordance with the 499 goals or task demands , which typically catch one ' s central attention 500 and recruit the episodic memory system to form task - related or valu - 501 able associations to navigate future decisions ( Luo and Niki , 2002 , 502 2003 ; Zeithamova et al . , 2012 ) . The novelty of a creative problem - 503 solving method , however , could be more likely to interact with one ' s 504 habit and be mediated by non - declarative memory because it breaks 505 habitual cognitive modes and establishes new cognitive modes . More - 506 over , there were too many different possibilities to decompose charac - 507 ter chunk in novel ways . The complex and probabilistic nature of the 508 task could hinder the attentive processing mediated by declarative 509 memory and enhance the non - declarative memory ( Poldrack et al . , 510 2001 ) . This observation challenges the traditional view that regards in - 511 sight and creative thinking as primarily declarative or explicit memory 512 processes and implies that declarative and non - declarative processes 513 may jointly contribute to the fundamental features of creative thinking . 514 The neural basis associated with both novelty and appropriateness 515 Activations in the ACC , the PFC , and the posterior parietal cortex 516 were found to be associated with both novelty and appropriateness . Ac - 517 cording to the known function of these areas and their activity patterns 518 exhibited across the four conditions , we divided these regions into two 519 sets of functional groups ( Fig . 5 ) . The ﬁ rst group included the ACC 520 ( BA24 ) and the left PFC ( BA8 / 46 ) , which could function as a monitoring 521 system . The activation pattern of the ACC ( Novel - Appropriate N 522 Familiar - Appropriate ; Novel - Appropriate N Novel - Inappropriate ) 523 implied that its function was related to a speci ﬁ c con ﬂ ict detecting 524 process during creative chunk decomposition . This inference is consis - 525 tent with previous studies in which the ACC was involved in con ﬂ ict 526 detection and performance monitoring ( Botvinick et al . , 1999 , 2001 ; 527 Carter et al . , 1998 ; Fanet al . , 2007 , 2008 ) , includingthecon ﬂ ictbetween 528 old and new cognitive models in creative problem - solving ( Luo et al . , 529 2004 ; Mai et al . , 2004 ) , and especially when more than one dif ﬁ culty 530 source was present in old cognitive models to prevent individuals 531 from identifying a novel way of problem - solving ( Wu et al . , 2013 ) . 532 This ﬁ nding that the ACC exhibited the highest activation during the Fig . 6 . The default mode network ( DMN ) activation shows the intersection between Familiarity ( Familiar - Appropriate and Familiar - Inappropriate N Novel - Appropriate and Novel - Inappropriate ) and Appropriateness ( Familiar - Appropriate and Novel - Appropriate N Familiar - Inappropriate and Novel - Inappropriate ) .

Given that these areas are involved in the manipula - 554 tion of spatial representation ( Lane et al . , 2012 ; Wu et al . , 2013 ) and 555 cognitive control ( Koechlin et al . , 2003 ; Miller , 2000 ) , the function of 556 these parietal and PFC areas in the present task could be associated 557 with visual – spatial processing and related executive control , which 558 are required in visual chunk decomposition ( Wu et al . , 2013 ) . 559 Brain activities associated with both familiarity and appropriateness 560 Moreover , regions of the DMN , including the vmPFC and the PCC / 561 precuneus , are associated with both familiarity and appropriateness . It 562 is consistent with recent functional and structural MRI studies that 563 revealed the role of DMN in creative cognition ( Ellamil et al . , 2012 ; 564 Gonen - Yaacovi et al . , 2013 ; Junget al . , 2013 ; Kuhnet al . , 2014 ; Takeuchi 565 et al . , 2011 ; Wise and Braga , 2014 ) . The DMN is a speci ﬁ c set of brain 566 regions that are activated during spontaneous thought but typically 567 deactivated during the performance of goal - directed tasks ( Buckner 568 et al . , 2008 ; Greicius et al . , 2003 ; Raichle et al . , 2001 ; Ralchle and 569 Snyder , 2007 ) . Spontaneity and cognitive loads can be embodied as 570 the activation or deactivation of the DMN ( Andrews - Hanna , 2012 ; 571 Mantini and Vanduffel , 2013 ; Newton et al . , 2011 ) ; the higher the de - 572 gree of spontaneity or the lower the level of cognitive load , the less 573 deactivation of the DMN is observed during active thinking ( Mason 574 et al . , 2007 ; Mayer et al . , 2010 ; Preminger et al . , 2011 ) . In this study , 575 greater deactivation of the DMN was found in the “ novel vs . familiar ” 576 contrasts and the “ inappropriate vs . appropriate ” contrasts . This ﬁ nd - 577 ing can be attributed to the ideas that the familiar or appropriate 578 problem - solving strategies could be processed more smoothly 579 than the novel or inappropriate ones . Differences in the deactivation of 580 theDMNamongthefourconditionsexactlyre ﬂ ectthedifferences in re - 581 sponse times ( i . e . , Novel - Inappropriate N Novel - Appropriate N Familiar - 582 Inappropriate N Familiar - Appropriate ) , implying that the task dif ﬁ culty 583 and the deactivation of the DMN could be closely related . Our results 584 arethe ﬁ rstsystematicevidenceshowingthatthenoveltyandappropri - 585 ateness of an insight chunk decomposition task can be processed with 586 parametrically different dif ﬁ culties . This result , although not surprising , 587 is generally in line with the energy - saving laws of the brain , which 588 indicate that there might be a hierarchy of information processing that 589 assigns different priorities to the various methods of chunk decomposi - 590 tion . In particular , relative to the novel methods , the familiar methods 591 have overall processing priority , even when they are inappropriate . 592 This hierarchical system is consistent with the frequency - biased re - 593 sponse mode related to creative problem - solving ( Gupta et al . , 2012 ) 594 and provides a good account of the constraints due to knowledge and 595 previous experience that are involved in a relatively automatic manner 596 ( Gupta et al . , 2012 ; McCaffrey , 2012 ; Storm and Angello , 2010 ) . 597 Limitations and future directions 598 One limitation of this study was that participants performed chunk 599 decomposition with the help of hints from prede ﬁ ned , externally 600 presented cues , rather than generated the solution by themselves . Al - 601 though this approach wasnecessary for usto systematically manipulate 602 the dimensions of novelty and appropriateness in insight , it also re - 603 stricts the applicability of the conclusions . Even so , given that the exter - 604 nally induced insight also involved deep representational change and 605 the subsequent veri ﬁ cation process , which constitute the main body 606 of the insight process , we may speculate that some observations of 607 this study can also be found in the self - generated insight , especially 608 the processes involved in cognitive restructuring , such as memory - , 609 emotion - , and motivation - related processes , as well as the process for 610 visual – spatial processing and the corresponding executive function . 611 However , for the cognitive brain processes that are sensitive to the 612 external task , especially con ﬂ icting or demanding ones ( such as ones 613 related to the function of the dorsal ACC and DMN ) , it remains to be de - 614 termined whether the results of externally induced insight can also be 615 found in self - generated insight . Another possible limitation of this 616 study is related to the representativeness of insight for creative cogni - 617 tion . Although insight is generally regarded as an indispensable part of 618 creative thinking ( Dietrich and Kanso , 2010 ) , it is still unclear how 619 well it can represent all types of creativity . Beaty et al . ' ( 2014 ) most re - 620 centstudy indicated that people ' sperformancesin solvinginsight prob - 621 lems could not predict their real - life creativity , which implies that one ' s 622 ability to solve insight problems may have no direct relationship with 623 one ' s real - life creativity . We should be prudent in generalizing our ob - 624 servations on insight problem - solving to all types of human creative 625 processes . Further studies are needed to explore the cognitive and neu - 626 ral mechanisms of novelty and appropriateness processing in various 627 forms of creative thinking such as the Alternative Uses Task ( AUT ) , as 628 well as other kinds of insightful puzzle / riddle solving task . 629 Acknowledgments 630 This work was supported by funding programs from the National 631 Natural Science Foundation of China ( Grant No . 31271079 ) and the Na - 632 tional Basic Research Program of China ( Grant 2010CB833904 ) . 633 References 634 Abraham , A . , 2014 .
