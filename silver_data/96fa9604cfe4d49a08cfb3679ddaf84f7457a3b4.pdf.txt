A proteomics approach was used to identify HBx - interacting proteins involved in HBx - induced hepatocarcinogenesis . We validated the proteomics ﬁ ndings by co - immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy . We performed cell proliferation , migration assays and cell cycle analyses in HCC cells . Finally , we con ﬁ rmed the clinical signi ﬁ cance of our ﬁ ndings in samples from patients . We found that cortactin ( CTTN ) is a novel HBx - interacting protein , and HBx regulates the expression of CTTN in the HCC cell lines MHCC - LM3 and HepG2 . Mechanistically , by upregulating the expression of cAMP response element - binding protein ( CREB1 ) and its downstream targets , such as cyclin D1 and MMP - 9 , the effects of the HBx - CTTN interaction on the enhancement of cellular proliferation and migration were maintained by inhibiting cell cycle arrest . In addition , we demonstrated that the levels of CTTN and CREB1 were closely correlated in clinical samples from HBV - infected patients with HCC . Overall , our data suggests that HBx contributes to cell migration and proliferation of HCC cells by interacting with CTTN and regulating the expression of CTTN and CREB1 . Therefore , the HBx / CTTN / CREB1 axis is a potential novel therapeutic target in HCC . Introduction Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is an aggressive human malignancy 1 – 3 . Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection is the most common risk factor for HCC , and there are ~ 250 million chronic HBV carriers in the world 4 – 7 . Although HBV vaccines have obviously decreased the number of new HBV infection cases , they have limited bene ﬁ ts for previously diagnosed patients with chronic HBV infection 8 , 9 . The HBV genome comprises four overlapping open - reading frames : preC / C , preS / S , P , and X 10 . The X protein ( HBx ) , encoded by the X region , is a multifunctional viral regulator involved in viral pathogenesis and carcinogenesis , and it plays an impor - tant role in HBV - related HCC processes , such as autop - hagy regulation , DNA repair inhibition , post ‐ transcriptional regulation , and cell cycle arrest 9 , 11 – 14 . HBx interacts with many host targets , and as such , it is important in viral hepatocarcinogenesis 15 – 19 . For exam - ple , HBx activates transcription by interacting with tran - scription factors or complexes , including P53 , C / EBP , Sp1 , and STAT3 20 – 27 . HBx also activates various cellular signal transduction pathways related to its transactivation , such as the NF - κ B , AMP - activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , and MEKK1 / Jun kinase signaling pathways 22 , 28 . Thus , the identi ﬁ cation of novel HBx – host interactors and the pathways they are involved with might aid in the development of effective therapies for patients with HCC . In this study , we looked for HBx - interacting proteins in HCC and explored their mechanism of action . Our data demonstrated the physical association between HBx and CTTN and identi ﬁ ed the new HBx / CTTN / CREB1 axis as © The Author ( s ) 2019 OpenAccess ThisarticleislicensedunderaCreativeCommonsAttribution4 . 0InternationalLicense , whichpermitsuse , sharing , adaptation , distributionandreproduction inanymediumorformat , aslongasyougiveappropriatecredittotheoriginalauthor ( s ) andthesource , providealinktotheCreativeCommonslicense , andindicateif changesweremade .

Methods Cell lines , cell culture , and cell transfection The HCC cell lines HepG2 and MHCC - LM3 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC , Manassas , VA , USA ) and China Center for Type Culture Collection ( CCTCC , China ) and cultured in Dulbecco ’ s Modi ﬁ ed Eagle ’ s medium ( DMEM ) supple - mented with 10 % ( v / v ) fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) at a humidi ﬁ ed incubator with 5 % CO 2 at 37 °C . HBx and CREB1 overexpression was achieved by transfection of HBx ( Plasmid # 42596 , Addgene , MA , USA ) or CREB1 - overexpressing vectors ( GeneCopoecia , Guangzhou , China ) . The empty vector pcDNA3 . 1 ( vector NC ) was used as control ; CTTN knockdown was achieved by transfection of small interfering RNAs targeting CTTN ( si - CTTN ; GeneCopoeia , Maryland , USA ) . HCC cells ( 1 . 5 × 10 5 ) grown on six - well plates were transfected with 100 pmol siRNA or 2 µg of overexpression vectors using 6 µL of Lipofectamine 2000 ( # 11668019 , Invitrogen , MA , USA ) as described by the manufacturer . The cells were harvested after 48 h . Western blot analyses or other experiments were performed . The siRNA and vector construction primer sequences are listed in Table S1 . Establishment of stably HBx - expressing HepG2 cells Target HBx sequences of pcDNA3 . 1 - Flag HBx plasmid ( Plasmid # 42596 , Addgene , MA , USA ) were ampli ﬁ ed by PrimeSTAR GXL DNA polymerase ( # R050A , Takara , Dalian , Japan ) . Next , HBx gene products and pLV - cDNA ( No . 632177 , Clontech , CA , USA ) were ampli ﬁ ed via enzyme digestion and puri ﬁ cation according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . After the enzyme - linked reaction , ampli ﬁ cation , and DNA sequencing , we con - structed a recombinant pLV - cDNA - HBx plasmid through the recombination of the digested HBx fragment and the puri ﬁ ed pLV - cDNA product . According to the lentiviral packaging system protocol ( Clontech , CA , USA ) , we col - lected lentiviral particles by transient transfection of 293 T cells , and then infected HepG2 cells with lentivirus . A Blasticidin S ( # 60218ES10 , Yeasen , Shanghai , China ) concentration of 6 µg / mL selected stably expressing HBx target cells . In this study , the stably modi ﬁ ed cells ( HBx - HepG2 ) were only used in the identi ﬁ cation of proteins interacting with HBx , veri ﬁ cation of the interaction between CTTN and HBx , and determination of CTTN mRNA levels and CTTN protein stability experiments . Immunoprecipitations Stably HBx - expressing HepG2 cells were lysed in a co - immunoprecipitation lysis buffer ( buffer composed of 20 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 150 mM NaCl , and 1 % Triton X - 100 ; P0013 , BBI , Shanghai , China ) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail for 60 min at 4 °C . After centrifugation , the supernatant was incubated with anti - mouse IgG ( # 3420 , CST , MA , USA ) at 4 °C for 60 min and then with 20 μ L of protein G agarose beads ( # 37478 , CST , MA , USA ) ; an anti - HBx antibody ( M10514 , Xiamen Innovax Biotech , Xiamen , China ) was then added , and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight . Protein complexes con - taining the HBx antibody were precipitated with anti - mouse IgG beads , and washed with RIPA lysis buffer ( P0013 , BBI , Shanghai , China ) and phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , sequentially . Finally , the pellet was eluted and subjected to SDS - PAGE analysis . Mass spectrometry ( MS ) and database analysis LC - ESI - LTQ - Orbitrap - MS analysis of proteins was performed as previously described by us 29 . The protein bands were excised and destained with 100 mM NH 4 HCO 3 in 50 % acetonitrile ( ACN ) . The proteins were reduced ( 10 mM dithiothreitol , 56 °C , 30 min ) , alkylated ( 50 mM iodoacetamide , in the dark , 20 − 25 °C , 30 min ) , and dried in a vacuum centrifuge . The gel pieces that contained proteins were incubated in a digestion solution ( 40 mM NH 4 HCO 3 , 9 % ACN , and 20 μ g / mL trypsin ) at 37 °C for 18 – 24 h . The tryptic peptide mixture was pur - i ﬁ ed with a ZipTipC18 microcolumn ( cat . no . ZTC18S096 ; Millipore , Darmstadt , Germany ) . The pur - i ﬁ ed tryptic peptide mixture was separated onto a Pep - Map C18 trap column ( 75 μ m , 15 cm ) at a column ﬂ ow rate of 200 nL / min . The MS scan and MS spectra were measured in data - dependent mode with MS / MS analysis of the seven strongest ions in the LTQ . The MS data were analyzed using the Xcalibur software and submitted to the database search via Proteome Discoverer . Search para - meters included taxonomy ( Homo sapiens ) , enzyme ( trypsin ) , MS / MS tolerance ( ±0 . 5 Da ) , peptide tolerance ( 20 ppm ) , peptide charge ( 2 + , 3 + , and 4 + ) , missed cleavage sites ( 2 ) , ﬁ xed modi ﬁ cation ( carbamoyl methy - lation of cysteine ) , and variable modi ﬁ cation ( methionine oxidation ) . Western blot analysis Cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer ( BBI ) and separated by electrophoresis , transferred to membranes , and sub - jected to western blot according to the standard proce - dure . The primary antibodies used included anti - HBx ( dilution 1 : 1000 , M10514 , Xiamen Innovax Biotech , Xia - men , China ) , anti - CTTN ( dilution 1 : 1000 , ab81208 , Abcam ) , anti - CREB1 ( dilution 1 : 1000 , Cat . # 9197 , CST ) , anti - cyclin D1 ( dilution 1 : 1000 , D220509 , BBI ) , anti - MMP - 9 ( dilution 1 : 1000 , ab73734 , Abcam ) , anti - GAPDH ( dilution 1 : 2000 , ab8245 , Abcam ) , anti - E - cadherin ( Cat . Li et al . Cell Death and Disease ( 2019 ) 10 : 405 Page 2 of 11 Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association 20874 , Proteintech ) , and anti - vimentin ( dilution 1 : 1000 , sc - 80975 , Santa Cruz ) . After incubating with goat anti - mouse and goat anti - rabbit secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature , immunoreactive bands were visualized with a chemiluminescence system and quanti ﬁ ed using Image J software . Immuno ﬂ uorescence staining For the detection of the intracellular distribution of HBx and CTTN , cells ( 1 × 10 5 per well ) were seeded in six - well glass - bottom plates , ﬁ xed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min , and then permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 ( PBS ) for 10 min . Nonspeci ﬁ c binding sites were blocked with 1 % bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h . Cells were treated with a primary antibody speci ﬁ c for HBx ( 1 : 1000 , M10514 , Xiamen Innovax Biotech ) or CTTN ( dilution 1 : 1000 , ab81208 , Abcam ) overnight at 4 °C . Thereafter , the cells were incubated with eFluor570 - F ( ab ’ ) 2 - goat anti - mouse IgG / IgM ( H + L ) ( dilution 1 : 20 , Cat . # 41 - 4010 - 82 , Invitrogen ) and FITC - goat anti - Rabbit IgG ( H + L ) cross - adsorbed secondary antibody ( dilution 1 : 20 , Cat . # F - 2765 , Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . DAPI ( Beyotime , Shanghai , China ) was used to stain nuclei before captur - ing images . The images were acquired using a confocal microscope ( Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) . The green ﬂ uorescence indicated HBx expression , the red ﬂ uores - cence indicated CTTN expression , and the blue ﬂ uores - cence indicated the nuclei . Protein – protein interaction analysis The Mentha ( http : / / mentha . uniroma2 . it / about . php ) , BioGrid ( https : / / thebiogrid . org / ) , IntAct ( https : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / intact / ) , and BIND ( https : / / www . bindingdb . org / bind / aboutus . jsp ) databases were used to analyze the proteins interacting with HBx or CTTN . The can - didate proteins were then applicated for Kyoto Ency - clopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG ) pathway annotation ( http : / / www . genome . jp / kegg / ) to identify the related pathways . The interaction network of these proteins was constructed using String ( https : / / string - db . org / ) and visualized with the Cytoscape software ( ver - sion 3 . 4 ) 18 . MTT assays MTT assays were performed to evaluate cell viability . Twenty - four hours after seeding into 96 - well plates ( 5 × 10 3 cells / well ) , HepG2 and MHCC - LM3 cells were transfected with si - CTTN ; 48 h after transfection , 20 μ L of MTT ( at a concentration of 5 mg / mL ; Sigma - Aldrich ) was added , and the cells were incubated for an additional 4 h in a humidi ﬁ ed incubator with 5 % CO 2 at 37 °C . DMSO ( 200 μ L ) was added after the supernatant was discarded to dissolve the formazan crystals , and ﬁ nally absorbance at 490 nm was measured ( PerkinElmer ) . The viability of non - treated cells ( control ) was de ﬁ ned as 100 % , and the viability of the other groups of cells was calculated accordingly . 5 - Bromo - 2 - deoxyuridine assays 5 - Bromo - 2 - deoxyuridine ( BrdU ) assays were conducted 24 and 48 h after cells were co - transfected with si - CTTN and pcDNA3 . 1 ( + ) - HBx - overexpressing vectors . Cells were seeded in 96 - well culture plates at a density of 2 × 10 3 cells / well , cultured for 48 h , and then incubated with a ﬁ nal concentration of 10 μ M BrdU ( BD Pharmingen , San Diego , CA , USA ) for 2 h . Cells were ﬁ xed for 30 min at room temperature , incubated with peroxidase - coupled BrdU antibody ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 60 min at room tem - perature , washed three times with PBS , incubated with peroxidase substrate ( tetramethylbenzidine ) for 30 min , and the 450 - nm absorbance values were measured for each well . Background BrdU immuno ﬂ uorescence was determined in cells not exposed to BrdU and stained with the BrdU antibody . Transwell assays Cells were co - transfected with si - CTTN and pcDNA3 . 1 ( + ) - HBx - overexpressing vectors , and seeded on the top side of polycarbonate transwell ﬁ lters . The cells were suspended in a medium without serum , while the bottom chamber was ﬁ lled with medium with serum . After 24 h , the non - migrating cells in the top chambers were removed with cotton swabs . The migrated cells on the lower membrane surface were ﬁ xed in 100 % methanol for 10 min , air - dried , stained with crystal violet ( BBI , Shang - hai , China ) , and counted under a microscope . Cell cycle analysis Cells ( 5 × 10 5 ) were silenced for CTTN or transfected with a plasmid CREB1 knockdown for 48 h . The cells were washed with PBS and collected into a 1 . 5 - mL cen - trifuge tube . Subsequently , the cells were ﬁ xed with 70 % ethanol for 24 h and then incubated with a propidium iodide solution ( C1052 , BBI , Shanghai , China ) . Flow cytometry was used to study the cell cycle distribution after HBx overexpression and CREB1 knockdown , according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions ( Millipore Guava easyCyte , ON , Canada ) . Quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) and tissue specimens The total RNA was isolated from stably HBx - expressing HepG2 cells and HBx ( + ) / ( − ) HCC tissues by using TRIzol ( Invitrogen ) following the manufacturer ’ s proto - col . A SYBR green PCR Master Mix ( Qiagen ) was used for mRNA expression detection following the protocol of the manufacturer . The GAPDH expression was used as an endogenous control . The 2 − ΔΔ CT method 30 was used to calculate the relative fold changes . Li et al .

Results Identi ﬁ cation of proteins interacting with HBx in HepG2 cells To identify proteins that interact with HBx , we used a CoIP - MS proteomic analysis of the HBx complexes iso - lated from HepG2 stably expressing HBx ( HBx - HepG2 ) cells using a HBx antibody ; nonimmune IgGs were used Fig . 1 CTTN interacts with HBx in HepG2 HCC cells . a Analysis of HBx - associated proteins by CoIP - MS in HepG2 cells overexpressing HBx ( HBx - HepG2 ) . b Representative MS / MS spectrum of CTTN ; the amino acid sequence of a doubly charged peptide with m / z 937 . 9402 was identi ﬁ ed as NASTFEDVTQVSSAYQK from mass differences in the y and b fragment ions series . c Protein sequence of CTTN : the matched peptides are labeled in red bold letters . d CoIP to validate the HBx - CTTN interaction .

The complexes were eluted and separated on 12 % SDS - PAGE ( Fig . 1a ) . Proteins in the gels were detected by Coomassie brilliant blue staining ( CBB ) , in - gel trypsin digested , and subjected to MS analysis .

Cell Death and Disease ( 2019 ) 10 : 405 Page 5 of 11 Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association Fig . 3 ( See legend on next page . ) Li et al . Cell Death and Disease ( 2019 ) 10 : 405 Page 6 of 11 Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association shown in Fig . 1d , CTTN was detected in anti - HBx immunoprecipitates but not in the control samples , sug - gesting the interaction between CTTN and HBx in vitro . Subsequently , we investigated CTTN and HBx subcellular localization in HBx - HepG2 cells to determine where they interacted with each other . Immuno ﬂ uorescence staining indicated that HBx enhanced CTTN ﬂ uorescence inten - sity ( Fig . 1d ; Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . Moreover , CTTN and HBx colocalized in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 1e ) . Roles of HBx / CTTN interaction in enhancing cell proliferation and migration To investigate whether the HBx / CTTN interaction had an impact on cellular processes , we conducted MTT , BrdU , and transwell assays . We found that HBx sig - ni ﬁ cantly increased the CTTN in HepG2 and MHCC - LM3 cells . While CTTN silencing could partially reverse the effect of HBx on CTTN protein expression ( Fig . 2a ) . The upregulation of CTTN expression by HBx might be associated with the increase of protein stability ( Supple - mentary Fig . S2 ) . MTT and BrdU assays showed that the viability and DNA synthesis ability of HepG2 and MHCC - LM3 cells increased upon HBx overexpression and decreased upon CTTN silencing , and CTTN silencing reversed the effects of HBx overexpression in cells that overexpressed HBx and were silenced for CTTN ( Fig . 2b – e ) . Similarly , transwell assays revealed that cell migration was signi ﬁ cantly suppressed by CTTN knock - down and promoted by HBx overexpression ( Fig . 2f , g ) . These ﬁ ndings indicate that HBx promotes cell pro - liferation and migration of HCC cells by interacting with CTTN . HBx - CTTN interaction modulates CREB1 and its downstream target genes To investigate how HBx - CTTN modulates cell pro - liferation and migration , we performed bioinformatics analyses and analyzed the signaling pathways that are involved ( Fig . S3 ) . Proteins that might be related to HBx and CTTN were analyzed using online databases . A total of 124 human proteins were predicted to interact with CTTN ( Table S3 ) , and a total of 20 proteins were pre - dicted to bind to HBx ( Table S4 ) . KEGG pathway annotation ( Tables S5 and S6 ) showed that 16 proteins ( nine for CTTN and seven for HBx ) were involved in viral carcinogenesis ( hsa05023 ) ; these proteins were selected and visualized using Cytoscape . We found that , among them ( Fig . 3a ) , a cellular transcription factor was reported to participate in HBx - induced dysregulation of lipogenesis in HCC cells 31 . Previous studies have shown that CREB1 knockdown inhibits the expression of its downstream targets : cyclin D1 , Bcl - 2 , and MMP - 9 in gastric cancer 2 . Based on its essential role in HCC , CREB1 was chosen as a potential target . Therefore , we decided to focus on CREB1 as the possible target of HBx - CTTN . To evaluate the combined effects of HBx and CTTN on CREB1 and its downstream target genes , MHCC - LM3 and HepG2 cells were silenced for CTTN , and the protein levels of CREB1 , cyclin D1 , E - cadherin , vimentin , and MMP - 9 were examined . We found that CTTN knock - down remarkably increased E - cadherin protein levels and reduced the levels of CREB1 , cyclin D1 , vimentin , and MMP - 9 , while HBx overexpression decreased E - cadherin expression and increased the levels of CREB1 , cyclin D1 , vimentin , and MMP - 9 , and the effect of HBx over - expression was partially attenuated by CTTN knockdown ( Fig . 3b ) . The epithelial – mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is directly linked to tumor initiation and invasion 32 . Therefore , we monitored the expression of EMT markers and found that CREB1 overexpression signi ﬁ cantly reduced E - cadherin expression and increased vimentin and MMP - 9 levels in MHCC - LM3 and HepG2 cells , and this effect was reversed by CTTN knockdown ( Fig . 3c ) . We further assessed the relationship between HBx - CTTN and CREB1 . The western blot results showed that CREB1 knockdown increased E - cadherin expression and reduced MMP - 9 and vimentin expression ; these effects were reversed by HBx overexpression ( Fig . 3d ) . We found that CREB1 knockdown inhibited cell migration and induced cell cycle arrest at G1 , while these effects could be reversed by HBx overexpression ( Fig . 4a – c ) . Therefore , ( see ﬁ gure on previous page ) Fig . 3 The HBx - CTTN interaction modulates CREB1 and its downstream target genes . a Analysis of HBx and CTTN protein – protein network using online databases .

Cell Death and Disease ( 2019 ) 10 : 405 Page 7 of 11 Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association our results suggested that CREB1 and its downstream targets can be regulated by the HBx - CTTN complex . Positive correlation between the high expression of CTTN and CREB1 in HBV - associated patients To investigate the clinical signi ﬁ cance of our ﬁ ndings , the mRNA levels of CTTN and CREB1 were evaluated by qPCR in HCC tissues of patients . As shown in Fig . 5 , the levels of CTTN in the HBx ( + ) group were signi ﬁ cantly upregulated compared with the HBx ( − ) group ( P < 0 . 01 ) , and similar results were obtained with CREB1 ( P < 0 . 01 ) . In addition , CTTN and CREB1 expression were positively correlated in tissue samples .

Cell Death and Disease ( 2019 ) 10 : 405 Page 8 of 11 Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association transcription activation , transactivation , DNA damage repair , and cell transformation inhibition 7 , 9 , 13 , 23 , 33 . For example , HBx inhibits DNA repair by interacting with PARP1 and SIRT6 , resulting in dissociation of SIRT6 and PPAP1 9 . HBx also inhibits cell apoptosis by regulating the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress response : GRP78 interacts with HBx in the ER , and this interaction leads to the interruption of ER stress response and host cell apoptosis 17 . Many studies have shown that HBx partici - pates in the regulation of viral or host proteins by protein – protein interactions , providing potent evidence for HBV - related tumorigenesis . However , how HBx pro - tein induces HCC is still unclari ﬁ ed . In this study , we undertook a proteomics approach to identify HBx - interacting proteins and found that CTTN , a Src sub - strate , was a novel HBx - interacting protein . Previous studies have shown that Src protein and RNA expression levels are signi ﬁ cantly upregulated in most HBV + – HCC specimens and HBx transgenic mice , and the overexpression of Src promotes cell viability , migra - tion , and cell colony formation 34 – 36 . The Src substrate CTTN has been found to be overexpressed in various cancers , including human colorectal cancer , esophageal tumors , and non - small - cell lung cancer , and HCC and CTTN overexpression closely correlates with tumor aggressiveness , cell adhesion , and cell motility 37 – 42 . We demonstrated that HBx contributed to cell migration and proliferation of HCC by binding CTTN in the cytoplasm and upregulating its expression . It has been reported that the phosphorylation and activation of Src are increased in HCC and result in the phosphorylation of CTTN at Y421 36 , 43 , 44 . This modi ﬁ cation is closely associated with CTTN localization and function through the regulation of its interaction with other host proteins 45 . We believe that the adjacent region between Y421 and the SH3 domain of CTTN ( aa 490 – 550 ) in the C terminus contributes to the phosphorylation of CTTN at Y421 upon HBx - CTTN interaction , and affects the structure and biological functions of CTTN . This hypothesis needs further investigation . Furthermore , we found that HBx regulates CTTN protein expression at the post - transcriptional level , and HBx increases CTTN protein stability ( Figure S2 ) . Given that Zhao J . et al . reported that CTTN protein degradation was conducted by ubiquitin - independent proteasome system , we assumed that HBx could increase the stability of CTTN through attenuation of CTTN ’ s ubiquitination 46 . We also performed bioinformatics analyses to identify the potential targets of HBx and CTTN . Based on its essential role in HCC , CREB1 was chosen as a potential target . We hypothesized that the HBx - CTTN interaction may affect CREB1 and its downstream targets . CREB1 is part of leucine zipper family of proteins , and its expres - sion is essential for various cell functions , including apoptosis , cell cycle , and DNA repair 47 – 49 . Once activated , CREB1 regulates its downstream target genes , including the apoptosis suppressor gene Bcl2 , a metalloproteinase involved in extracellular matrix remodeling , MMP9 , and the cell cycle - related genes , cyclin D1 , A1 , and B1 2 , 50 . Previous studies have revealed that HBx can induce CREB - mediated activation of miR - 3188 and Notch sig - naling , resulting in the development of HBV - related HCC 51 – 53 . Based on our data , we illustrate a critical oncogenic role of CREB1 , which is overexpressed and correlates with CTTN in HBV + HCC . Furthermore , by targeting CREB1 , the HBx - CTTN interaction forms a critical oncogenic axis , which regulates cell proliferation , migration , and oncogenic signaling in HCC . Bioinfor - matics analysis has shown that SKP2 , a vital component of the SCF ubiquitin E3 ligase , is involved in HBV - related Fig . 5 Upregulation of CTTN and CREB1 in clinical specimens . a , b CTTN and CREB1 expression in 30 HBx ( + ) and 22 HBx ( − ) HCC tissues from patients , as assessed by qPCR . The data are presented as mean ± SD of three independent experiments . * * P < 0 . 01 . c The correlation between CTTN and CREB1 expression in tissue samples was analyzed using Spearman ’ s rank correlation analysis Li et al . Cell Death and Disease ( 2019 ) 10 : 405 Page 9 of 11 Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association tumorigenesis 54 . CTTN also plays a role in SKP2 expression 55 , 56 . Therefore , the HBx - CTTN interaction has a possible effect on SKP2 . This hypothesis might be investigated in the future . Based on this work , we provided a novel mechanism of how HBx contributes to the progression of HCC : HBx interacts with CTTN in the cytoplasm , resulting in the upregulation of CREB1 , which promotes the proliferation and migration of HCC . The crosstalk between CTTN and HBx may also provide a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC therapy .
