Two main ligand / receptor pairs are involved in these cell behaviors : the chemokine CXCL13 / chemokine receptor CXCR5 and antigen / BCR . Little is known regarding the inter - play between CXCR5 and BCR signaling in the modulation of B - cell dynamics and its effect on B - cell activation . We used a 2 - dimensional model to study B - cell mi - gration and antigen recognition in real time , and found that BCR signaling strength alters CXCL13 - mediated migra - tion , leading to a heterogeneous B - cell behavior pattern . In addition , we demon - strate that CXCL13 / CXCR5 signaling does not impair BCR - triggered immune syn - apse formation and that CXCR5 is ex - cluded from the central antigen cluster . CXCL13 / CXCR5 signaling enhances BCR - mediated B - cell activation in at least 2 ways : ( 1 ) it assists antigen gathering at the synapse by promoting membrane rufﬂing and lymphocyte function – associated antigen 1 ( LFA - 1 ) – supported adhesion , and ( 2 ) it allows BCR signaling integration in motile B cells through es - tablishment of LFA - 1 – supported migra - tory junctions . Both processes require functional actin cytoskeleton and non - muscle myosin II motor protein . There - fore , the CXCL13 / CXCR5 signaling effect on shaping B - cell dynamics is an effec - tive mechanism that enhances antigen encounter and BCR - triggered B - cell acti - vation . ( Blood . 2011 ; 118 ( 6 ) : 1560 - 1569 ) Introduction The incessant migration of B cells in vivo in the secondary lymphoid organs ( ie , the lymph nodes and spleen ) is a search for speciﬁc antigens . 1 , 2 Once B cells enter lymph nodes through the high endothelial venules , they move toward the follicles , guided by the chemokine CXCL13 and a network of stromal cells . 3 B cells concentrate in the proximity of the follicular dendritic cell ( FDC ) network to form the follicles , which are conﬁned by a ceiling of subcapsular sinus macrophages , a ﬂoor of ﬁbroblastic reticular cells and dendritic cells , and interfollicular walls composed mainly of macrophages and ﬁbroblastic reticular cells . In steady - state conditions , B cells explore the entire follicular volume , moving randomly at an average speed of 6 (cid:1) m / min . 1 , 2 CXCL13 , which is produced mainly by FDCs , underlies this B - cell behavior by signaling through its receptor , CXCR5 . 4 Speciﬁc antigen recognition through BCR alters steady - state B - cell dynamics at the follicle . B cells stop to gather antigen into a central cluster at the site of contact with the antigen - presenting cell , establishing an immune synapse ( IS ) . 5 IS formation is critical for B - cell activation , antigen internaliza - tion , and afﬁnity discrimination , as shown by in vitro 6 , 7 and in vivo approaches . 8 Although the B cell IS persists for at least 20 - 30 minutes , it is a transient stage . In vivo , B cells accumulate particulate antigen with time 5 up to a threshold that triggers their capacity to respond to CCL21 through CCR7 , after which they exit the follicle in search of T - cell help . 2 These data suggest a series of “stop plus IS” events , followed by “go or motile” events on the B cell to achieve antigen accumulation . Modula - tion of B - cell dynamics thus becomes critical for shaping the process of antigen encounter and subsequent B - cell activation . The nature of the interplay between BCR and CXCR5 in regulating B - cell behavior is nonetheless almost entirely unknown . We established a 2 - dimensional model that allows the study of CXCL13 - mediated B - cell migration and antigen encounter in real time . To mimic the cell surface , we used planar lipid bilayers containing the lymphocyte function – associated antigen 1 ( LFA - 1 ) integrin ligand ICAM - 1 as the GPI - linked protein , as well as tethered antigen and a CXCL13 coating . This model allowed us to reproduce steady - state B - cell dynamic parameters similar to those observed in vivo with multiphoton microscopy techniques . Using distinct BCR transgenic models , we show herein that BCR signaling strength alters CXCL13 - mediated B - cell migration . CXCL13 / CXCR5 signaling does not signiﬁ - cantly affect BCR - triggered IS formation , and CXCR5 segre - gates outside of the central antigen / BCR cluster of the synapse ; however , it enhances BCR - mediated cell activation . CXCL13 / CXCR5 facilitated antigen encounter and BCR signaling by promoting membrane rufﬂing and LFA - 1 – supported adhesion in stopped / IS - forming B cells , and through the establishment of an LFA - 1 – supported migratory junction ( “kinapse” ) in motile B cells . Both mechanisms require a functional actin cytoskel - eton and the activity of the motor protein non - muscle myosin II ( NM - II ) . Submitted January 21 , 2011 ; accepted May 30 , 2011 .

Animal experimentation was approved by the Centro Nacional de Biotecnología / Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientíﬁcas Bioethics Committee and conforms to institutional and national regulations . The murine A20 B - cell line was stably transfected with the CXCR5 - green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) construct ( see supplemental Methods , available on the Blood Web site ; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article ) . Time - lapse microscopy on planar lipid bilayers Planar lipid bilayers were prepared as described previously . 6 Brieﬂy , unlabeled GPI - linked ICAM - 1 liposomes and / or liposomes containing biotinylated lipids were mixed with 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - PC at various ratios to obtain speciﬁed molecular densities . Membranes were assembled in FCS2 chambers ( Bioptechs ) and then blocked with PBS with 2 % FCS for 1 hour at room temperature . Antigen was tethered by incubating membranes with Alexa Fluor 647 – streptavidin ( Molecular Probes ) , followed by mono - biotinylated peptide p31 for 3 - 83 B cells , 12 monobiotinylated F10 anti – hen egg lysozyme ( anti - HEL ) mAb plus HEL ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for MD4 B cells , 6 or monobiotinylated anti - (cid:3) light chain mAb ( BD Biosciences ) for non - BCR transgenic B cells and the A20 B - cell line . The ﬁnal step was coating with recombinant murine CXCL13 ( Peprotech ) at the indicated concentration for 30 minutes at room temperature immediately before imaging . CFSE - labeled B cells were injected into the warmed ( 37°C ) chamber at time zero ; confocal ﬂuorescence , differential interference contrast ( DIC ) , and interference reﬂection microscopy ( IRM ) images were acquired every 10 seconds for 25 minutes . All assays were performed in PBS with 0 . 5 % FCS , 0 . 5 g / Lof D - glucose , 2mM MgCl 2 , and 0 . 5mM CaCl 2 , followed by injection with latrunculinA ( 0 . 5 (cid:1) M ; Calbiochem ) or blebbista - tin ( 50 (cid:1) M ; Calbiochem ) to the FCS2 , waiting for 5 - 10 minutes , and then imaging again for 20 minutes . Images were acquired on a Zeiss Axiovert LSM 510 - META inverted microscope with a 40 (cid:4) oil - immersion objective and analyzed by LSM 510 software ( Zeiss ) and Imaris 6 . 0 software ( Bitplane ) . Graphs and statistical analyses were generated with Prism 4 . 0 software ( GraphPad ) ; the unpaired Student t test was applied . For quantita - tive studies at the target membrane and the cell surface , see supplemental Methods . For intracellular Ca 2 (cid:5) ﬂux measurement , puriﬁed B cells were labeled with 1 (cid:1) M Fluo - 4FF ( Molecular Probes ) for 30 minutes at room tempera - ture , immediately injected into the warmed FCS2 chamber , and imaged every 10 seconds for 15 or 30 minutes at low quality to speed up acquisition . Ca 2 (cid:5) ﬂux was monitored by ﬂuorescence and DIC images , and analyzed by LSM 510 software ( Zeiss ) .

Results Two - dimensional model to study B - cell dynamics in response to CXCR5 and BCR signaling To dissect the control of naive B - cell dynamics by CXCR5 and BCR signaling , we established a model that allowed simultaneous study of CXCL13 - mediated B - cell migration , B - cell antigen recog - nition , and IS formation . The planar lipid bilayer system mimics the ﬂuid surface of a cell 13 and has been used to study B - cell antigen encounter 6 ; we optimized conditions for migration of primary naive B cells in response to CXCL13 on this substrate . Data for CXCL13 immunostaining in lymphoid tissue , 14 as well as its ability to bind certain glycosaminoglycans present on cell surfaces , 15 suggest that , in vivo , B cells encounter CXCL13 on the FDC surface ; the FDC network has a central role in orchestrating B - cell motility at the follicle . 3 To mimic this in vivo situation , we coated the artiﬁcial membranes with CXCL13 and , given the positive charge of chemokines , CXCL13 easily associated with the negatively charged phospholipids through electrostatic interaction . Homogeneous CXCL13 binding to the lipid bilayer might provide a chemokinetic stimulus and thus lead to random B - cell migration , as described in vivo 1 , 2 ; to date , no CXCL13 gradient has been reported within the follicle . As a GPI - linked membrane protein , we included the adhesion molecule ICAM - 1 , the principal ligand of the integrin LFA - 1 . LFA - 1 / ICAM - 1 have a critical role in B - cell IS formation , 6 and are implicated in B - cell contact with FDCs 16 and in lymphocyte movement . 17 - 19 In addition , leukocytes show a prefer - ence for migrating on adhesive substrates coated with immobilized chemokine . 20 The setup of our model might therefore promote this type of “haptokinetic” response in B cells . We isolated wild - type naive B cells from mouse spleen and assayed their migratory capacity on CXCL13 - coated , ICAM - 1 – containing membranes in real time using confocal microscopy approaches ( supplemental Video 1 ) . DIC examination of naive B cells on ICAM - 1 – containing membranes with CXCL13 coating showed 2 distinct morphologies : nonpolarized B cells ( round shape ) and cells with a ﬂattened leading - edge extension at the front ( lamellipodium ) , followed by the bulky nucleus at the back ( polarized B cells ; Figure 1A ) . The presence of CXCL13 on the membrane was sufﬁcient to promote polarization of the naive B - cell population ( Figure 1B ) . Nonetheless , naive B cells migrated only when CXCL13 was combined with ICAM - 1 . Both CXCL13 - mediated cell polarization and migration were dependent on the expression of CXCR5 at the B - cell surface , as the results with CXCR5 - deﬁcient B cells indicated ( Figure 1B ) . Above a minimum ICAM - 1 density of 75 molecules / (cid:1) m 2 , most of the B - cell population migrated in response to CXCL13 ( Figure 1B ) . Both cell polarization and migration were dependent on the chemokine concentration used to coat the membranes , and there - fore on the amount of CXCL13 on the bilayer ( Figure 1C ) ; 100nM CXCL13 yielded optimal B - cell polarization and migratory re - sponses . Analysis of the cell dynamic parameters showed an average speed of (cid:2) 5 (cid:1) m / min at ICAM - 1 densities of 150 and 300 molecules / (cid:1) m 2 ( Figure 1D ) , which is very close to the in vivo B - cell interstitial velocity within the follicle ( 6 (cid:1) m / min ) . 1 The tracks stress the characteristic random B - cell motility , with average total lengths of 120 (cid:1) m for the time recorded ( Figure 1D - E ) . Migration of naive B cells slowed when they were exposed to higher ICAM - 1 densities ( 600 molecules / (cid:1) m 2 ; Figure 1D ) , high - lighting the effect of the integrin ligand on B - cell dynamics . We used IRM to analyze the nature of the contacts established by B cells with the lipid bilayer at different ICAM - 1 densities ( Figure 1F ) . Migration failure at ICAM - 1 densities of (cid:6) 75 molecules / (cid:1) m 2 correlated with small , intermittent B - cell contacts . B cell : membrane interactions were similar in area and were stable over time at higher densities . We established a 2 - dimensional model that supports naive B - cell migration in response to CXCL13 . The use of 100nM CXCL13 to coat the membrane plus an ICAM - 1 density of 150 molecules / (cid:1) m 2 yielded optimal conditions for B - cell motility , CXCR5 SIGNALING SHAPES B - CELLBEHAVIOR 1561 BLOOD , 11AUGUST 2011 (cid:1) VOLUME 118 , NUMBER 6 For personal use only . on April 12 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From and resembled in vivo steady - state dynamics in the follicle . We used these conditions for the remainder of the study . BCR signaling strength alters CXCL13 - mediated B - cell migration To study the effect of antigen encounter on CXCL13 - induced B - cell migration , we used BCR - transgenic 3 - 83 B cells , which recognize the p31 antigenic peptide with low afﬁnity ( K A 65 (cid:4) 10 6 M (cid:7) 1 ) . We anchored p31 to the membrane , as described previously 6 ( see “Methods” ) . The dynamic parameters of 3 - 83 naive B - cell movement across the ICAM - 1 – containing membranes were equiva - lent to those of wild - type B cells in response to CXCL13 ( Figure 2A - C ) . Depending on its density , tethered p31 altered cell migra - tion in several ways ( Figure 2A - C and supplemental Videos 2 - 5 ) . B - cell motility was completely abolished at high p31 densities ( 100 molecules / (cid:1) m 2 ) ; only a few cells moved and did so at low speed , describing very short tracks independently of the presence of CXCL13 . Five times less p31 ( 20 molecules / (cid:1) m 2 ) allowed 30 % of the B cells to migrate , but at approximately half the average speed and with tiny tracks . This motility was due mainly to CXCL13 signals , because p31 alone promoted some migration in only 10 % of B cells . B - cell migration was recovered at low p31 densities ( 4 molecules / (cid:1) m 2 ) , although with signiﬁcant differences in average speed and cell tracks relative to controls ( no p31 ) . To conﬁrm our results in a different BCR - transgenic model and with another antigen , we used MD4 BCR - transgenic B cells that recognize HEL with very high afﬁnity ( K A 5 (cid:4) 10 10 M (cid:7) 1 ; see “Methods” ) . MD4 B cells migrated on ICAM - 1 – containing mem - branes in response to CXCL13 , although in lower numbers and at a lower average speed than wild - type B cells ( supplemental Figure 1A - C ) . Results were nonetheless similar to those obtained above . Because of the higher afﬁnity and consequent stronger BCR signaling , MD4 B - cell migration stopped at 20 molecules / (cid:1) m 2 antigen density . As HEL decreased ( 4 and 1 molecule / (cid:1) m 2 ) , the CXCL13 signal overcame the BCR signaling effect and promoted migration of a percentage of the B - cell population ( 33 % and 66 % , respectively , of migration in the absence of antigen ) . These cells nonetheless moved more slowly and had short tracks ( supplemental Figure 1A - C ) . To verify that the moving cells detected the low HEL density , we analyzed the levels of phosphorylated Syk ( p - Syk ) , an early marker of BCR signaling , 21 at the B - cell contact zone with the membrane ( see “Methods” ) . We costained with phalloidin , which identiﬁes migratory cells by the lack of the F - actin ring characteris - tic of stopped cells that form an immune synapse . 22 Quantitative analyses of p - Syk ﬂuorescence showed higher p - Syk levels in migratory MD4 B cells on CXCL13 - coated membranes containing low doses of HEL than on membranes with chemokine alone ( supplemental Figure 1D ) . Results were similar for 3 - 83 B cells in the presence of low p31 doses ( not shown ) . Our data indicate that BCR signaling strength , which is a direct function of abundance of and BCR afﬁnity for antigen , models CXCL13 - mediated B - cell migration with a wide range of conse - quences . Whereas strong BCR signals drive the B cell to halt its movement ( STOP signal ) , weak BCR signals allow B cells to migrate in response to CXCL13 ( GO signal ) at frequencies near those of no antigen . A heterogeneous pattern of B - cell behaviors ( lower migration frequency , diminished velocity , and shorter tracks ) lies between the STOP and GO states . Figure 1 .

B - cell synapse formation was inversely correlated with CXCL13 - induced B - cell migration . At a p31 density of 100 mol - ecules / (cid:1) m 2 , nearly all 3 - 83 B cells formed a detectable IS as measured by antigen accumulation and formation of a central cluster ( Figure 2D - E ) . This observation was correlated with a high frequency of B cell : membrane contacts ( detected by IRM ) , which were CXCL13 independent ( Figure 2F ) . At a 5 - fold lower antigen density , only 20 % - 30 % of 3 - 83 B cells showed measurable aggre - gation of p31 ; however , 75 % of the cells were IRM positive in the presence of CXCL13 and 50 % were in its absence ( Figure 2E - F ) . The IRM areas were larger in the presence of CXCL13 than in its absence at both p31 densities ( Figure 2G ) . We detected no IS at a p31 density of 4 molecules / (cid:1) m 2 , although LFA - 1 was active on the 3 - 83 B - cell surface in the presence of CXCL13 ( (cid:9) 70 % of B cells were IRM positive ; Figure 2E - F ) . There were no signiﬁcant differences in the total number of p31 molecule at the IS using antigen alone or with CXCL13 ( Figure 2G ) . Results were similar for MD4 B cells and the high - afﬁnity HEL antigen ( supplemental Figure 1E - H ) . Our data indicate that CXCL13 / CXCR5 signaling does not signiﬁcantly affect the frequency of BCR - triggered B cells that Figure 2 .

By promoting the LFA - 1 / ICAM - 1 interaction , CXCL13 / CXCR5 sig - naling nonetheless enhances the frequency and / or area of contact with the membrane . CXCR5 is excluded from the cSMAC but does not polarize to the B - cell IS To study the molecular dynamics of CXCR5 at the B cell : target membrane interface in the migratory stage compared with IS formation , we generated the CXCR5 - GFP construct and trans - fected it into the A20 B - cell line ; we then used confocal micros - copy to follow CXCR5 - GFP distribution at the B cell : membrane interface through time . Contact with CXCL13 - coated ICAM - 1 – containing membranes promoted movement in 15 % - 20 % of A20 B cells ( data not shown ) , in which CXCR5 - GFP was distrib - uted homogenously at the contact zone , with some aggregates at the tips of the leading cell edge ( Figure 3Aand supplemental Video 6 ) . In contact with membranes that included tethered surrogate antigen ( anti - (cid:3) mAb ; see “Methods” ) , CXCR5 - GFP segregated to the periphery of the contact zone , whereas antigen accumulated at the center to form the so - called central supramolecular activation cluster ( cSMAC ; Figure 3B - C and supplemental Video 6 ) . Analysis of the GFP signal in the remainder of the cell body nevertheless indicated that CXCR5 - GFP did not polarize to the IS ( Figure 3D ) . To conﬁrm these data in primary naive B cells , we immunostained ﬁxed cells and used confocal microscopy to analyze endogenous CXCR5 distribution in conjugates of 3 - 83 B cells with antigen - presenting cells ( ICAM - 1 - GFP transfectants of L cells expressing H - 2K K , an antigen recognized by the 3 - 83 BCR ; see “Methods” ) . Three - dimensional reconstruction of confocal images at the IS site showed CXCR5 exclusion from the cSMAC , whereas it colocal - ized with the distinctive ICAM - 1 ring of the peripheral SMAC ( pSMAC ; supplemental Figure 2 ) ; again , we observed no CXCR5 polarization to the B - cell IS ; the chemokine receptor remained evenly distributed over the remainder of the B - cell surface . Our results show that whereas the B cell migrates , CXCR5 distribution is relatively homogenous on the area of contact with the target cell . Antigen recognition through the BCR triggers IS formation ; CXCR5 subsequently segregates toward the periphery of the contact zone and is excluded from the cSMAC but not from the pSMAC . Nevertheless , CXCR5 does not polarize to the target cell contact site in the B - cell synaptic phase . CXCL13 / CXCR5 signaling enhances BCR - mediated B - cell activation To determine the effect of CXCL13 in the process of B - cell activation by antigen , we cultured naive MD4 B cells ( 18 - 20 hours ) on membranes bearing different densities of tethered HEL alone or with chemokine . Cells were collected and CD86 and CD69 activa - tion marker expression analyzed at the B - cell surface by ﬂow cytometry ( Figure 4 ) . We found a signiﬁcant increase in the frequency of B - cell activation ( CD86 hi CD69 (cid:5) ) in the presence of CXCL13 at HEL densities of 4 and 1 molecule / (cid:1) m 2 ( conditions in which no IS was detected and a fraction of B cells migrated ; supplemental Figure 1 ) . No signiﬁcant chemokine effect was detected at 20 molecules / (cid:1) m 2 . Results were similar for naive 3 - 83 B cells and p31 ( supplemental Figure 3A ) . To conﬁrm that enhanced B - cell activation was due to CXCL13 signaling through CXCR5 , we carried out activation assays using naive B cells isolated from wild - type and CXCR5 - deﬁcient mice . Membrane - bound anti - (cid:3) mAb was used as a surrogate antigen because these cells were not BCR transgenic ; we focused on low antigen densities at the membrane to improve detection of the chemokine effect . Whereas CXCL13 increased wild - type B - cell activation in response to the surrogate antigen , no effect was Figure 3 . CXCR5 distribution at the contact site of migratoryB cellsandattheB - cellIS .

We conclude that CXCL13 / CXCR5 signaling boosts BCR - mediated B - cell activation . This effect is more robust in limiting conditions of BCR stimulation ( low antigen abundance ) . CXCL13 / CXCR5 signaling assists antigen gathering at the B - cell IS by promoting membrane rufﬂing and LFA - 1 – supported contact We studied the molecular mechanism underlying the CXCL13 / CXCR5 – mediated increase in antigen activation of B cells . We observed enhanced frequency and area of B cell : target membrane contacts when CXCL13 was present ( Figure 2F - G and supplemen - tal Figure 1G - H ) ; therefore , CXCR5 signaling promoted LFA - 1 / ICAM - 1 interactions . This pair of adhesion molecules facilitates antigen - mediated B - cell activation by mediating adhesion and IS formation . 6 We focused on the membrane contacts established by halted B cells ( IS stage ) ; the presence of CXCL13 supported dynamic contact over time , with constant changes in shape and area as determined by IRM ( Figure 5A , supplemental Videos 7 and 8 , and supplemental Figure 4A ) . Establishment of new contacts coincided with the detection of membrane rufﬂes extension by DIC , and was usually accompanied by detectable antigen gathering from the area near the IS toward the cSMAC ( measured by ﬂuorescence ; Figure 5A and supplemental Figure 4A ) . CXCL13 - mediated enhancement of membrane rufﬂing on halted B cells was detected at all antigen densities tested ( Figure 5B and supplemental Figure 4B ) , and was also observed in the absence of antigen on the Figure 4 .

CXCR5 SIGNALING SHAPES B - CELLBEHAVIOR 1565 BLOOD , 11AUGUST 2011 (cid:1) VOLUME 118 , NUMBER 6 For personal use only . on April 12 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From few halted B cells found . The absence of ICAM - 1 prevented contact of the CXCL13 - triggered rufﬂe with the target membrane and therefore antigen gathering from the synapse vicinity ( supple - mental Figure 4C - D ) . Similar studies of wild - type compared with CXCR5 - deﬁcient B cells conﬁrmed that this effect requires CXCR5 signaling ( supplemental Figure 5 ) . F - actin analysis by phalloidin staining on ﬁxed B cells showed actin cytoskeleton reorganization at the CXCL13 - mediated mem - brane rufﬂes , in addition to the classic F - actin ring that surrounds the antigen cluster at the IS ( Figure 5C ) . Once IS were established , the addition of latrunculin A ( a drug that inhibits actin polymeriza - tion ) to planar lipid bilayers completely abolished membrane rufﬂing on halted B cells , also leading to their detachment from the target membrane within minutes ( Figure 5D ) . Membrane rufﬂe extension was followed by its contraction to the cell body , which led us to target NM - II , a motor protein that exerts contraction of actin ﬁlaments . 23 NM - II function requires phosphorylation of the regulatory myosin light chains ( MLCs ) . Using immunoﬂuores - cence techniques , we detected phosphorylated MLCs ( pMLCs ) at the B - cell contact area with the target membrane ( Figure 5C ) . pMLCs showed patched distribution in the vicinity of the B - cell IS antigen cluster , but associated mainly with the outer edges of the cell . Therefore , these data suggested the presence of active NM - II at the membrane rufﬂes . Treatment of halted B cells with the speciﬁc NM - II inhibitor blebbistatin blocked CXCL13 - mediated membrane rufﬂing within minutes ; halted B cells nonetheless remained adhered to the target membrane ( Figure 5D ) . Our data show that CXCL13 / CXCR5 signaling enhances BCR - mediated B - cell activation by assisting antigen gathering from the IS surroundings through membrane rufﬂing and LFA - 1 – supported contacts with the target membrane . Both events depend on a functional actin cytoskeleton and NM - II motor protein activity . CXCL13 - mediated migration allows BCR signal integration through establishment of an LFA - 1 – supported migratory junction or kinapse CXCL13 - mediated enhancement of membrane contacts detected at low antigen densities ( p31 density of 4 molecules / (cid:1) m 2 ; HEL density of 1 molecule / (cid:1) m 2 ) was correlated with high cell migration frequency ( Figure 2A , F and supplemental Figure 1A , G ) . Several studies indicated that T cells integrate antigen / TCR - mediated sig - nals while migrating over the surface of the antigen - presenting cell , 24 - 26 and this migratory junction is called a kinapse . 27 We studied this possibility on migratory B cells as an additional mechanism for the CXCL13 / CXCR5 – mediated increase in BCR - mediated B - cell activation . To track BCR signaling , we monitored Ca 2 (cid:5) ﬂux in MD4 B cells in contact with membranes bearing HEL at a density of 1 molecule / (cid:1) m 2 alone or with CXCL13 . B cells were preloaded with Fluo4FF and Ca 2 (cid:5) changes were followed by real - time confocal microscopy ; we detected intermittent Ca 2 (cid:5) signals in half of the migratory B cells on CXCL13 - coated target membranes ( Figure 6A - B and supplemental Video 9 ) . There were no measurable changes in Ca 2 (cid:5) levels on B cells settled on target membranes in the absence of chemokine ( Figure 6A ) or in the absence of ICAM - 1 ( not shown ) ; in both conditions , cells ﬂoated above the membrane due to lack of contact ( supplemental Figures 1G and 6D ) . In the presence of CXCL13 , we also detected Ca 2 (cid:5) signals on migratory B cells at 4 molecules / (cid:1) m 2 HEL or even with no antigen ( Figure 6B ) . Chemokine receptors trigger Ca 2 (cid:5) inﬂux after ligand binding 28 ; however , single - cell Ca 2 (cid:5) proﬁles showed higher intensity peaks when antigen was available than with chemokine alone at the target membrane ( Figure 6C ) . Results were similar for 3 - 83 B cells ( supplemental Figure 6A - C ) . We used immunoﬂuorescence techniques to analyze the acto - myosin network on migratory B cells at the contact zone with the target membrane . Phalloidin staining indicated actin cytoskeleton rearrangement at the leading edge ; pMLCs showed a patched pattern across the entire contact area , with brightest signals near the border ( Figure 6D ) . Latrunculin A inhibition of actin polymeriza - tion on migratory B cells eliminated cell motility within minutes , as well as adhesion to the ICAM - 1 – containing target membrane ( Figure 6E ) . Blebbistatin treatment of migratory B cells to inhibit NM - II eradicated cell motility , but not LFA - 1 – supported mem - brane contact ( Figure 6E ) . Our data indicated that at antigen densities unable to promote B - cell stop and IS formation , CXCL13 - mediated migration allows antigen encounter and integration of BCR signals by establishing an LFA - 1 – supported kinapse , and this process requires operative actin cytoskeleton and NM - II motor protein . Through this mecha - nism , CXCR5 signaling could also enhance BCR - mediated B - cell activation . Discussion In the present study , we sought to understand the interplay between 2 ligand / receptor pairs involved in B - cell dynamics at the follicle , CXCL13 / CXCR5 and antigen / BCR , and to determine how B - cell fate could be affected by instructing cell behavior . We established a 2 - dimensional model based on ICAM - 1 – containing planar mem - branes , in which naive B cells move in response to a CXCL13 coating . The migration pattern resembles the in vivo dynamics of B cells on the FDC network in lymph nodes ( random tracks , average speed (cid:9) 6 (cid:1) m / min ) . The combination of CXCL13 and antigen stimulation at the membrane results in a wide range of B - cell behaviors based on BCR signaling strength . We observed that CXCL13 / CXCR5 signaling did not impair BCR - triggered B - cell IS formation ; however , it signiﬁcantly enhanced BCR - mediated B - cell activation . The presence of CXCL13 led to markedly increased membrane rufﬂing and LFA - 1 – supported adhe - sion in halted / IS - forming B cells ; both events assisted antigen gathering from the synapse vicinity and thus BCR signaling . At limiting conditions of antigen abundance , CXCL13 - mediated mi - gration promoted the formation of an LFA - 1 – supported kinapse that allowed antigen encounter and BCR signaling events ( Ca 2 (cid:5) inﬂux ) on motile B cells . Through these 2 means , dependent on a functional actomyosin network , CXCR5 signaling boosts BCR - mediated B - cell activation . Our data showed modulation of CXCL13 - mediated B - cell migration by integrin ligand density at the target membrane . We found ICAM - 1 densities of 100 - 200 molecules / (cid:1) m 2 on the surface of splenocytes in steady state ( not shown ; see supplemental Methods ) . After inﬂammatory stimulation , adhesion molecule expression increased at the surface of different cell types ( after 20 hours of in vitro TNF stimulation , splenocytes expressed ICAM - 1 densities of (cid:2) 600 molecules / (cid:1) m 2 ; data not shown ) . These changes in the environment could retard B - cell movement in vivo , promoting a more meticulous search for antigen . Although leukocyte movement can occur in the absence of integrins , 29 the same investigators recently described a cell preference for move - ment over a surface with an ICAM - 1 and a chemokine coating ( haptokinesis ) , even when chemotactic signals were present . 20 Adhesion molecule levels and possibly their distribution pattern , 30 1566 SA´EZ DE GUINOAet al BLOOD , 11AUGUST 2011 (cid:1) VOLUME 118 , NUMBER 6 For personal use only . on April 12 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From as well as chemokine - regulated integrin adhesiveness , 19 thus appear to be pivotal factors in the modulation of interstitial leukocyte dynamics , which remains to be explored in depth . Few studies have addressed the molecular dynamics of chemo - kine receptors at the IS . In T cells , CXCR4 and CCR5 are recruited to the IS 31 ; speciﬁcally , CXCR4 appears to localize at the pS - MAC . 32 Our study establishes CXCR5 distribution at the B - cell synapse . CXCR5 localization at the pSMAC could help to promote membrane rufﬂing at the synaptic stage ; in addition , its nonpolariza - tion to the IS might maintain B cells’ability to respond to CXCL13 in the vicinity of the target cell . During B - cell migration , CXCR5 is distributed nearly homogeneously at the target membrane contact site . Although we detected some receptor aggregates or clusters at the leading edge tips , CXCR5 did not polarize , as suggested for other chemokine receptors . 33 , 34 Relatively uniform CXCR5 distri - bution at the contact site could help to explain the rapid , random changes in direction during B - cell migration . Our results identify a costimulatory function for CXCL13 / CXCR5 signaling in BCR - triggered B - cell activation ; this effect was more pronounced in suboptimal BCR stimulation conditions . We found that the CXCR5 - mediated effect on cell dynamics assists BCR - triggered B - cell activation . At limiting conditions of antigen density , naive B cells established an LFA - 1 – supported kinapse with the target membrane in response to CXCL13 ; through this migratory junction , they encountered antigen and integrated BCR signals . When antigen density was sufﬁcient to trigger a stop signal through the BCR , naive B cells established a synapse with the target membrane ; CXCR5 signaling then promoted membrane rufﬂing and LFA - 1 / ICAM - 1 contacts that increased antigen gather - ing near the IS and thus BCR signaling . Other studies have highlighted the importance of cell behavior modulation for lympho - cyte fate . APC - bound CCL21 appears to prime T cells for IS formation . 35 CXCR4 and CCR5 promote more stable T cell : APC Figure 6 .

CXCR5 SIGNALING SHAPES B - CELLBEHAVIOR 1567 BLOOD , 11AUGUST 2011 (cid:1) VOLUME 118 , NUMBER 6 For personal use only . on April 12 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From conjugates by increasing adhesion . 31 Chemokine - guided recruit - ment of CD8 T cells to CD4 T cell / dendritic cell interaction sites fosters generation of memory CD8 T cells . 36 Regulation of thymo - cyte dynamics also appears to be critical for positive selection events in the thymus . 37 In any case , we cannot discard a role for CXCR5 - mediated activation of other signaling pathways in costimu - lation , and further studies are clearly needed . The actomyosin network has a critical role in cell polarization , migration , and adhesion . In T cells , NM - II is necessary for fast ameboid motility ; this motor protein regulates surface contact area to allow high speed of movement . 38 - 40 NM - II is also important for the formation and persistence of T - cell synapses and for TCR signaling . 41 In B cells , this motor protein is needed for BCR - driven antigen processing and presentation . 42 Our immunoﬂuorescence and drug - treatment data also suggest participation by and the necessity for an operative actomyosin network for CXCL13 - mediated , LFA - 1 – supported B - cell motility and membrane ruf - ﬂing . At longer treatment times , NM - II inhibition also provoked disassembly of the antigen cluster at the B - cell synapse ( not shown ) . The detection of antigen / BCR early signaling ( Ca 2 (cid:5) ﬂux ) during B - cell migration led us to question the need to establish an immune synapse for B - cell activation . Several studies in T cells have indicated TCR signal integration during migration in response to chemokines 24 , 25 ; the moving cell - cell junction that permits signal integration was deﬁned as the kinapse . 27 Recent in vivo studies showed antigen - triggered TCR internalization in the absence of T - cell arrest ; the investigators proposed a ﬂexible relationship between motility and the immune synapse , and that successful signaling does not necessarily require cSMAC formation . 43 Based on our data , we propose that B cells also exploit both types of interfaces , kinapses and synapses , to integrate BCR signals , with the use of one or the other being determined mainly by antigen quality and abundance . In T cells , PKC (cid:10) and WASp proteins regulate kinapse / synapse interconversion . 44 We have not observed this interconversion in our assays ; nonetheless , further studies will lead to a better comprehension of this phenomenon in B - cell dynamics .
