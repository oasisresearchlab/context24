Sphin - golipid - induced conformational changes in gp120 are required for HIV - 1 fusion . Galactosylceramide and sphingomyelin have been detected in highly purified preparations of prion rods , suggesting that the prion protein ( PrP ) may interact with selected sphingolipids . Moreover , a major conformational transition of the Alz - heimer (cid:1) - amyloid peptide has been observed upon in - teraction with sphingolipid - containing membranes . Structure similarity searches with the combinatorial ex - tension method revealed the presence of a V3 - like do - main in the human prion protein PrP and in the Alzhei - mer (cid:1) - amyloid peptide . In each case , synthetic peptides derived from the predicted V3 - like domain were found to interact with monomolecular films of galactosylcer - amide and sphingomyelin at the air - water interface . The V3 - like domain of PrP is a disulfide - linked loop ( Cys 179 – Cys 214 ) that includes the E200K mutation site associated with familial Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease . This mutation abrogated sphingomyelin recognition . The identifica - tion of a common sphingolipid - binding motif in gp120 , PrP , and (cid:1) - amyloid peptide underscores the role of lipid rafts in the pathogenesis of HIV - 1 , Alzheimer , and prion diseases and may provide new therapeutic strategies . One of the hallmarks of prion diseases is the cerebral accu - mulation of an abnormal form of prion protein ( PrP ) , 1 the so - called PrP sc , which is derived from the normal cell surface glycoprotein , PrP c ( 1 ) . The conformational change associated with the PrP c 3 PrP sc transition ( chiefly an (cid:1) - helix 3 (cid:2) - sheet transformation ) occurs in membrane microdomains enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol ( i . e . lipid rafts ) ( 2 , 3 ) . Correspond - ingly , infectious prion rods were found to contain the two sphin - golipids galactosylceramide ( GalCer ) and sphingomyelin , sug - gesting that both lipids may interact with normal and / or pathogenic prion proteins ( 4 ) . Interestingly , the HIV - 1 surface envelope glycoprotein gp120 also interacts with GalCer ( 5 , 6 ) , as well as with a few other sphingolipids found in membrane rafts , i . e . the ceramide trihexoside Gb3 , the monosialoganglio - side GM3 , and sphingomyelin ( 6 – 10 ) . Raft glycosphingolipids mediate lateral assemblies of the HIV - 1 fusion complex and stimulate the conformational changes in HIV - 1 envelope gly - coproteins required for initiating the fusion process ( 9 , 11 – 13 ) . Moreover , a major conformational transition of the Alzheimer (cid:2) - amyloid peptide is observed upon binding of the 1 – 40 (cid:2) - amy - loid peptide to ganglioside GM1 - containing membranes ( 14 ) . Taken together , these data suggest that conformational changes in prion , Alzheimer , and HIV - 1 proteins may occur in lipid rafts under the control of specific sphingolipids . The binding of HIV - 1 to GalCer is mediated by the third variable ( V3 ) loop of gp120 , as demonstrated by various immu - nological , biochemical and biophysical approaches ( 15 – 17 ) . Since GalCer is bound by both HIV - 1 gp120 and prion proteins , we looked for a potential V3 - like glycolipid - binding domain in human PrP . As a matter of fact , the search for molecules interacting with PrP c is a major issue in the transmissible encephalopathies field . The presence of a similar motif in the Alzheimer (cid:2) - amyloid peptide was also investigated . Structure similarity searches were carried out using the combinatorial extension ( CE ) method ( 18 ) . A putative GalCer - binding motif was identified in the human PrP protein on the basis of its structural homology with the V3 loop . A similar motif was also found in Alzheimer (cid:2) - amyloid peptide . The interaction of sphingolipids with the V3 - like domain of human PrP and Alz - heimer (cid:2) - amyloid peptide was analyzed using the Langmuir film balance technology . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials— The chemicals used in this study , including GalCer , sphingomyelin , and the (cid:2) - amyloid synthetic peptide ( fragment 1 – 40 ) of the higher purity available were purchased from Sigma . The synthetic peptides P1 ( KQHTVTTTTKGENFTETDVKMMER ) and P2 ( KQHT - VTTTTKGENFTKTDVKMMER ) respectively derived from the human PrP protein and the E200K mutant were purchased from Euro Se - quence Gene service ( Evry , France ) . The peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography ( purity (cid:1) 95 % ) and characterized by electrospray mass spectrometry ( experimental M r of 2812 . 4 and 2810 . 8 for peptides P1 and P2 , with a theoretical M r of 2811 . 4 and 2810 . 4 , respectively ) . Structure Analysis— Structure similarity searches were performed using the two chains calculation routine of the CE program ( Ref . 18 and cl . sdsc . edu / ce . html ) . CE aligns two polypeptide chains using character - istics of their local geometry as defined by vectors between carbon (cid:1) positions . Molecular structures were visualized using the SWISS - PDB viewer ( Ref . 19 and expasy . ch / spdbv / ) . PDB identification numbers were 1CE4 ( HIV - 1 gp120 V3 loop peptide ) , 1QLX ( human PrP ) , and 1BJB ( human Alzheimer peptide ) . Surface Pressure Measurements— The surface pressure was meas - ured with a fully automated microtensiometer ( (cid:3) TROUGH SX , Kibron Inc . ) . The apparatus allowed the recording of pressure - area compres - sion isotherms and the kinetics of interaction of a ligand with the monomolecular film using a set of specially designed Teflon troughs . All experiments were carried out in a controlled atmosphere at 20 °C (cid:2) 1 °C . Monomolecular films of the indicated lipids were spread on pure water subphases ( volume of 800 (cid:3) l ) from hexane : chloroform : ethanol * The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges .

After spreading of the film , 5 min was allowed for solvent evaporation . To measure the interaction of the peptide with lipid monolayers , various concentrations of the ligand were injected in the subphase with a 10 - (cid:3) l Hamilton syringe , and pressure increases produced were recorded until reaching the equilib - rium ( maximal surface pressure increase (cid:3) (cid:4) max usually obtained after 100 – 200 min of interaction ) .

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A V3 - like Domain in PrP and Alzheimer (cid:2) - Amyloid Peptide— Structure similarity searches revealed the presence of a HIV - 1 gp120 V3 - like motif in the human prion protein PrP and in the Alzheimer (cid:2) - amyloid peptide ( Fig . 1 a ) . The V3 - like domain of PrP consists of a helix - turn - helix motif formed by 33 of the 36 amino acid residues of a disulfide - linked loop ( Cys 179 – Cys 214 ) . This loop includes the (cid:1) 2 and (cid:1) 3 helix of PrP c ( Fig . 1 a ) . In the V3 loop of HIV - 1 gp120 , the motif is a hairpin structure with only one (cid:1) - helix corresponding to (cid:1) 3 in PrP . This is also the case for the Alzheimer (cid:2) - amyloid peptide . The V3 - like motif of PrP and Alzheimer proteins has the same size as the V3 loop so that they can be easily superimposed ( Fig . 1 b ) . Moreover , the motif contains His , Tyr , and / or Phe residues that mediate bind - ing to individual sugar rings of complex carbohydrates ( 20 – 22 ) . In particular , an aromatic residue essential for GalCer recog - nition ( 16 ) is found at the same position and has a similar orientation in both loops , namely Tyr 21 in the V3 loop , and Phe 198 in human PrP ( Fig . 1 b ) . In the same way , residues Tyr 10 of the Alzheimer (cid:2) - amyloid peptide and Phe 20 of the gp120 V3 loop could be partially superimposed . These observations sug - gest that the structural alignments are highly significant , in agreement with the alignment parameters ( including root mean square deviations ) provided by the CE program ( Table I ) . Thus , our study confirms the capacity of the CE program to detect specific motifs in unrelated proteins sharing little se - quence homology ( 18 , 23 ) . The V3 - like Region of Human PrP Is a Sphingolipid - binding Domain— GalCer and sphingomyelin were detected in highly purified infectious prion rods , suggesting that PrP may specif - ically interact with these sphingolipids during its stay in lipid F IG . 2 . Dose - dependent interaction between human PrP - de - rived synthetic peptides and a monomolecular film of GalCer prepared at an initial pressure ( (cid:2) i ) of 10 mN / m . Increases in the surface pressure induced by the indicated concentrations of peptide P1 ( wild - type sequence , squares ) or P2 ( E200K mutant sequence , circles ) added in the aqueous subphase were determined .

The Z - score is generally used to filter less significant results or alternatively look for weak similarities . For instance , Shao and Grishin ( 23 ) have identified a common helix - hairpin - helix fold in unrelated proteins with a Z - score of 3 . 1 , which is close to the values obtained in the present study . The relatively low values of the Z - score ( i . e . (cid:5) 3 . 5 ) may be explained by the very low level of sequence identity ( (cid:5) 10 % ) between the aligned motifs . d Ideally , the number of gap positions in alignment between two chains should be less than 20 % of aligned residue positions ( e . g . two gaps for 32 aligned residues , i . e . 6 . 25 % , in the case of 1CE4 / 1QLX alignment ) .

The identification of a V3 - like domain in human PrP prompted us to study the interaction of this domain with Gal - Cer and sphingomyelin . A peptide ( P1 ) derived from the puta - tive glycolipid - binding motif of human PrP ( KQHTVTTTTK - GENFTETDVKMMER ) was synthesized , and its interaction with sphingolipids analyzed using the Langmuir film balance technology . In these experiments , the peptide P1 was added in the aqueous subphase underneath a monomolecular film of lipid , and the resulting interaction was measured as an in - crease in the surface pressure of the film ( 6 ) . This technique is one of the most sensitive for studying lipid - ligands interactions ( 24 ) . The synthetic peptide P1 was found to interact specifically with GalCer , and the interaction was definitely dose - dependent ( Fig . 2 ) . The maximal surface pressure increase ( (cid:3) (cid:4) max (cid:6) 8 mN / m ) was obtained with a peptide concentration of 100 n M . Similar data were previously obtained in our laboratory with a synthetic peptide derived from the conserved motif of the V3 loop crown ( i . e . GPGRAF ) ( 6 ) . To assess the specificity of GalCer - peptide P1 interaction , monomolecular films of GalCer were prepared at various initial pressures ( (cid:4) i ) and the maximal surface pressure increase ( (cid:3) (cid:4) max ) induced by the peptide on these films was determined after equilibrium had been reached . Below a (cid:4) i of 30 mN / m , which corresponds to a fluid disordered ( Lc ) phase , the (cid:3) (cid:4) max induced by the peptide was between 5 and 10 mN / m ( Fig . 3 a ) . At a (cid:4) i of 30 mN / m , the value of (cid:3) (cid:4) max reached 16 mN / m . Then , for values of (cid:4) i above 30 mN / m , which do correspond to raft - like liquid - ordered ( Lo ) phase domains , (cid:3) (cid:4) max gradually F IG . 4 . Maximal surface pressure increase ( (cid:3)(cid:2) max ) reached after injection of human PrP peptides P1 ( a ) or P2 ( b ) under sphingomyelin films at various initial surface pressures ( (cid:2) i ) .

The influence of the initial surface pressure on the compressibility of the sphingolipid monolayer demonstrates the high specificity of the interaction as previ - ously established for several other lipids and ligands ( 6 , 24 ) . The critical pressure of insertion ( i . e . the theoretical value of (cid:4) i extrapolated for (cid:3) (cid:4) max (cid:6) 0 mN / m ) was 45 mN / m . Interest - ingly , the mean lipid density of cellular membranes corre - sponds to a surface pressure of at least 30 mN / m ( 25 ) . Thus , these data suggest that the interaction of peptide P1 with GalCer requires a densely packed organization of the glyco - sphingolipid , which is likely to occur within a lipid raft ( 26 ) . Effect of Mutation E200K in Human PrP for Sphingolipid Recognition— The V3 - like region of human PrP contains a mu - tation site ( E200K ) corresponding to the most common familial form of the Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease ( 1 ) . Residue 200 is lo - cated at the N - terminal end of the second (cid:1) - helix of the sphin - golipid - binding motif ( i . e . (cid:1) 3 of human PrP ) . Another synthetic peptide similar to P1 but bearing the E200K substitution was therefore synthesized ( P2 ) , and its interaction with sphingolip - ids was also analyzed using the lipid monolayer assay . As for peptide P1 , the interaction of peptide P2 with a monomolecular film GalCer ( (cid:4) i (cid:6) 10 mN / m ) was dose - dependent ( Fig . 2 ) . When the interaction was analyzed at various values of (cid:4) i , a triphasic pattern of interaction was evidenced ( Fig . 3 b ) . When (cid:4) i was between 10 and 15 mN / m , the maximal surface pressure in - crease induced by the peptide gradually decreased as (cid:4) i in - creased . Between 15 and 25 mN / M , the peptide did not affect the surface pressure of the GalCer monolayer . Finally , for values of (cid:4) i greater than 25 mN / m , a specific interaction oc - curred , with a critical pressure of insertion of 42 mN / m . These data indicate that both peptides P1 and P2 could interact with GalCer , with a marked preference for densely packed films that mimic the organization of sphingolipids found in membrane rafts . The minor differences observed at low surface pressures ( (cid:4) i (cid:5) 25 mN / m ) may not have important implications , since these values of the surface pressure do not reflect the organi - zation of lipids commonly found in biological membranes ( 25 ) . From a structural point of view , these data are consistent with the high level of structural homology between the wild - type and the E200K mutant of human PrP ( 27 ) . The main effects of the E200K mutation are ( i ) major changes in the distribution of charges on the protein surface and ( ii ) the loss of a salt - bridge interaction between the side chains of Glu 200 and Lys 204 . In any case , the E200K mutation has little ( if any ) effect on the orientation and accessibility of aromatic residues that are in - volved in binding to GalCer . However , the redistribution of surface charges induced by the E200K mutation may dramatically affect the interaction of PrP with charged lipids such as sphingomyelin . As shown in Fig . 4 b , the mutated peptide ( P2 ) could interact with sphingo - myelin only when the film was prepared at a very low (cid:4) i ( (cid:5) 15 mN / m ) . In particular , no interaction occurred at the physiolog - ical pressure of 30 mN / m . In contrast , the wild - type peptide ( P1 ) interacted with sphingomyelin films prepared at low and at high (cid:4) i ( critical pressures of insertion of 25 and 40 mN / m , respectively ) ( Fig . 4 a ) . These data show that the E200K muta - tion specifically affected the recognition of sphingomyelin . The replacement of an acid residue ( Glu ) by a basic one ( Lys ) in the sphingolipid binding site is likely to affect the binding of PrP to this positively charged lipid . Impaired recognition of sphingo - myelin in the raft environment may destabilize membrane - PrP c interactions and thus facilitate the conformational change associated with the PrP c 3 PrP sc transition . Indeed , the deple - tion of sphingomyelin in neural cells treated with either a ceramide synthase inhibitor or sphingomyelinase resulted in a marked stimulation of the PrP c 3 PrP sc conversion ( 28 ) . Most importantly , the V3 - like domain of PrP identified in the pres - ent study is involved in the dimerization of PrP , an early event that constitutes an important step on the pathway of the PrP c 3 PrP sc conversion ( 29 ) . Moreover , amino acid residues located in the vicinity of the putative raft - binding domain of PrP are thought to bind an auxiliary molecule essential to prion prop - agation ( 30 ) . Taken together , these data support the view that the V3 - like domain of PrP is involved in the PrP c 3 PrP sc conversion and that raft sphingolipids may play an active role in this process . This hypothesis is consistent with recent data showing that the conformation of prion proteins is highly sen - sitive to the membrane environment ( 31 ) . We propose that sphingolipids such as GalCer and sphingomyelin stabilize the non - pathological conformation of PrP c in the lipid raft through specific interactions with the V3 - like domain of PrP c . The (cid:2) - Amyloid Peptide Interacts with GalCer and Sphingo - myelin— Since a similar domain was characterized in Alzhei - mer (cid:2) - amyloid peptide , we studied the interaction of this pep - tide with GalCer and sphingomyelin using the monomolecular film binding assay ( Fig . 5 ) . In both cases , (cid:3) (cid:4) max gradually decrease as (cid:4) i increased ( critical pressures of insertion of 45 and 56 mN / m for GalCer and sphingomyelin , respectively ) . The ability of the (cid:2) - amyloid peptide ( fragment 1 – 40 ) to recognize both GalCer and sphingomyelin is likely due to the presence of both sugar - binding residues ( Tyr 10 , His 13 , His 14 , Phe 20 , Phe 21 ) and acid residues ( Asp 7 , Glu 11 ) within the V3 - like motif . Conclusion— The finding of a common sphingolipid - binding motif in Alzheimer , prion , and HIV - 1 proteins underscores the role of membrane rafts in the pathogenesis of the correspond - ing diseases . Further studies are warranted to assess whether raft lipids act as auxiliary molecules implicated in the confor - mational change of PrP ( 2 , 3 ) , as recently established for HIV - 1 gp120 ( 13 ) and for the Alzheimer (cid:2) - amyloid peptide ( 14 ) . In any case , the main outcome of the present study is the finding of a structural homology between unrelated proteins known to in - duce major morphological and functional alterations of the central nervous system . Synthetic soluble analogs of GalCer bind to the V3 loop of gp120 and inhibit HIV - 1 fusion ( 32 ) . It would be of interest to evaluate the activity of such glycolipid analogs on the PrP c 3 PrP sc conversion as well as on the formation of amyloid fibrils . REFERENCES 1 . Prusiner , S . B .
