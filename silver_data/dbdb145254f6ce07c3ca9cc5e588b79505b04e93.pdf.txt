( a ) Flag - tagged , constitutively active Rac or Cdc42 alone or together with Myc - tagged IRSp53 were transiently expressed in COS - 7 cells .

IRSp53 did not interact Research Paper IRSp53 induces filopodia Krugmann et al . 1647 Figure 2 proteins ( Figure 1b ) was analyzed in an overlay blot assay ( Figure 1c ) . No significant binding of Rac to IRSp53 could be observed using this assay , while L61Cdc42 did interact with IRSp53 , albeit significantly weaker than it did with a fragment of p65Pak . A small region of IRSp53 necessary for interaction with Cdc42 was mapped to residues 238 – 292 , and this was found to contain a partial CRIB motif , ISLP ( X ) 8 V ( amino acids 268 – 280 ; Figure 1d ) . The impor - tance of these residues was confirmed using the triple point mutant I268A , S269A , P271A ( (cid:2) CRIB ) , which abro - gated binding of IRSp53 to Cdc42 in the slot blot assay ( Figure 1e ) . We conclude that IRSp53 interacts with Cdc42 through a region containing a partial CRIB motif . Overexpression of IRSp53 induces filopodia To determine whether IRSp53 might participate in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton , subconfluent , quies - cent Swiss cells were microinjected with an IRSp53 ex - pression construct . At short expression times ( 60 – 100 min ) , filopodia were clearly induced in 55 % of the injected cells , as compared to 3 % of the dextran control - injected cells ( Figures 2a , panel ii , and 3b , panels i and ii ) . After longer times ( (cid:3) 4 . 5 hr ) , expression levels of IRSp53 were higher , and this resulted in severe cell retractions in 90 % of the IRSp53 - expressing cells ( Figures 2b , panel ii , and 3c , panels i and ii ) . This was confirmed by time - lapse video imaging ( data not shown ) . IRSp53 induces filopodia and cell retraction .

Immunoprecipitated IRSp53 fragments were detected simultaneously by immunoblotting , using antibodies against both the Flag and the Myc epitope tags .

Panels ii and iv represent 5 - fold enlargements of i and iii , respectively .

Using a slot blot overlay assay ( Figure 5b ) , the interaction of Mena with obtained peptide mass pattern matched to a human hypo - thetical protein ( database accession number GI : 6453482 ) IRSp53 appeared to be complex ; it interacted strongly with the SH3 domain - containing C - terminal part of IRSp53 ( aa of only 178 amino acids , which showed very strong simi - larity to the C - terminal part ( amino acids 364 – 541 ) of 319 – 521 ; Figure 5b , GST - CT ) and weakly to sequences between 180 and 319 ( Figure 5b , GST - (cid:2) CT ) . the mouse Mena protein ( database accession number GI : 1644455 ) .

Precipi - tated (cid:2) NT IRSp53 and NT IRSp53 were visualized with Coomassie blue ( Figure 6a , left panel ) , and any associated Mena was visualized by autoradiography . As can be seen in the right panel of Figure 6a , coexpression of the N - ter - minal fragment severely inhibits the interaction of Mena with IRSp53 . To determine whether the interaction between IRSp53 and Mena is regulated by Cdc42 , we took advantage of the fact that overexpressed Mena has been previously shown to induce and to localize to F - actin - containing puncta [ 24 , 25 ] . In agreement with our in vitro binding data , IRSp53 showed a striking colocalization with Mena at these puncta ( Figure 6b , panels i and ii ) . However , an IRSp53 construct with mutations in the CRIB motif ( IRSp53 I268A , S269A , P271A [ (cid:2) CRIB ] triple point mu - tant ) did not associate with Mena - induced puncta ( Figure 6b , panels iii and iv ) . This data suggests that the interac - tion of IRSp53 with Cdc42 ( via the CRIB motif ) is re - quired to promote the interaction between IRSp53 and Mena . IRSp53 and Mena synergize in vivo to promote filopodia formation To address the significance of the IRSp53 : Mena interac - tion , Mena was expressed alone or with full - length IRSp53 in quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells . After relatively long expression times ( 3 hr ) , 38 % of the cells injected with a Mena construct developed some filopodia ( Figure 7a ) , similar to cells expressing IRSp53 alone ( Figure 7c ) . How - ever , coexpression of both Mena and IRSp53 led to a very dramatic phenotype , with 63 % of the cells showing dense filopodia structures over the entire cell periphery , even after short expression times ( Figure 7b , g shows a Mena - and IRSp53 - expressing cell after 90 min ) . To confirm that this synergistic effect is dependent on a direct interaction between Mena and IRSp53 , Mena was coexpressed with full - length IRSp53 containing two amino acid substitutions ( F428A , P429A ) in the SH3 do - main . This mutant interacts poorly with Mena , and , when expressed alone , it does not induce filopodia . As shown in Figure 7d , the SH3 point mutations abolished the syn - ergistic effects on filopodia formation observed after coex - pressing Mena and IRSp53 , with 23 % of the cells showing a few filopodia . IRSp53 interacts directly with Mena and Scar2 . ( a ) In vitro - translated , [ 35 S ] Met Mena and Scar2 proteins ( lanes 1 and 2 ) were allowed to interact with ( lanes 3 and 5 ) recombinant GST or ( lanes 4 and 6 ) To determine whether the N - terminal fragment of GST - (cid:2) NT IRSp53 fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione IRSp53 can interfere with Mena function in vivo , three agarose . After extensive washing , proteins were resolved by SDS - constructs were coexpressed in Swiss 3T3 cells .

( b ) GST fusions of IRSp53 constructs in Figure 7e , coexpression of the N - terminal fragment of were immobilized on nitrocellulose , as indicated on the right - hand IRSp53 severely inhibited filopodia formation induced by side , and the blot was overlaid with in vitro - translated [ 35 S ] Met Mena . a combination of Mena and full - length IRSp53 . After washing , Mena that had associated with the IRSp53 truncations was visualized by autoradiography . Finally , to determine whether Cdc42 is required to relieve Research Paper IRSp53 induces filopodia Krugmann et al . 1651 Figure 6 IRSp53 autoinhibition , a full - length IRSp53 construct con - taining three amino acid substitutions in the CRIB motif ( (cid:2) CRIB IRSp53 ) was coexpressed with Mena . As seen in Figure 7f , only 12 % of the injected cells displayed some filopodia . Discussion The data indicate that IRSp53 interacts with Cdc42 , but not Rac , in vitro and in vivo in a GTP - dependent manner through a partial CRIB motif . Ectopic expression of IRSp53 caused the formation of filopodia , but not lamelli - podia , in Swiss fibroblasts , while IRSp53 harboring a mu - tated CRIB motif was inactive . This suggests that this protein is a direct Cdc42 - regulated target involved in a pathway leading to actin polymerization and filopodia for - mation . Coexpression of the N - terminal 178 amino acids of IRSp53 inhibited filopodia formation induced by either IRSp53 or Cdc42 . We conclude from this that IRSp53 , similarly to WASp and p65PAK , two other targets of Cdc42 , contains autoinhibitory sequences that interfere with its function . Presumably , there is sufficient GTP - Cdc42 in IRSp53 - injected , starved Swiss cells to allow the opening up of some of the IRSp53 and for filopodium formation to occur . These observations linking IRSp53 to Cdc42 and filo - podia are consistent with those published recently by Govind et al . [ 21 ] , who reported a role for IRS - 58 , a longer isoform of IRSp53 , in neurite outgrowth and filopodia formation in a Cdc42 - dependent fashion . However , our findings cannot be easily reconciled with those of Miki et al . [ 20 ] , who placed IRSp53 downstream of Rac and who argued for a role for IRSp53 in the Rac - dependent formation of lamellipodia in COS - 7 cells . Interestingly , Miki and colleagues found that Rac interacted with se - quences located in the N - terminal 229 amino acids of IRSp53 , not through sequences surrounding the partial CRIB motif . We cannot easily account for these differ - ences , though one possibility is that this group used a different isoform of IRSp53 . Apart from IRS - 58 , three human IRSp53 splice variants differing only in their C termini have so far been reported [ 22 ] . To elucidate how IRSp53 , upon interaction with Cdc42 , leads to filopodia assembly , we have used affinity chroma - tography techniques coupled to MALDI - MS analysis to look for proteins that interact with the nonautoinhibited The N terminus and the CRIB motif of IRSp53 regulate Mena binding form of the protein . Using this approach , we identified to the IRSp53 SH3 domain .

In the resting state , the IRSp53 N terminus interacts with the central region of the molecule , and the SH3 domain is masked . In response to an appropriate stimulatory signal , GTP - loaded Cdc42 binds to the CRIB motif .
