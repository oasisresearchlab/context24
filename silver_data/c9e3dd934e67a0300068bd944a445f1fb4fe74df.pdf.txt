We here investigate the rhythmic con - tractions of the yolk during early development of the goldﬁsh Carassius auratus . We quantify these contractions and record robust and persistent rhythmic yolk movements that are not seen in closely - related species ( carp and zebraﬁsh ) . We report that yolk contractions are an intrinsic emergent property of the egg , i . e . goldﬁsh eggs are independently irritable / excitable . These contractions do not require sperm entry / fertilization nor cell division , and they notably emerge at a precise time — suggesting that goldﬁsh eggs are able to measure elapsed time from what we infer to be egg activation . As the yolk itself is known to confer critical cues for early dorsoventral ( DV ) patterning of teleost embryos , we hypothesize that its contractions in goldﬁsh may inﬂuence the patterning process of this species . Indeed , we ﬁnd that embryos in conditions that result in ventralized phenotypes ( i . e . goldﬁsh embryos acutely treated with microtubule - depolymerizing drug nocodazole and embryos of the twin - tail goldﬁsh strain Oranda ) display altered yolk contraction dynamics ( i . e . faster and / or stronger contractions ) . We aim to uncover whether the yolk contractions happening during early development of domesticated goldﬁsh are the licensing process which explain the variety of novel DV patterning phenotypes naturally - observed in this species ( e . g . twin - tail and dorsal - ﬁnless strains ) and which are instead not found among closely - related species ( e . g . carp ) whose yolks do not contract .

This coordination is highly dynamic and is often mediated by pro - cesses that themselves exhibit dynamic behaviors , such as oscillations and waves ( Cartwright et al . , 2009 ; Deneke and Di Talia , 2018 ; Di Talia and Vergassola , 2022 ; Goodwin and Cohen , 1969 ; Turing , 1952 ; Uriu , 2016 ) . The establishment of the animal body plan is a concrete example of the im - portance of such spatiotemporal regulation ( Bénazéraf and Pourquié , 2013 ; Cooke , 1988 ; Grimes and Burdine , 2017 ; Hibi et al . , 2018 ; Meinhardt , 2006 ) , as variation in this pro - cess and deviations from archetypal development are often lethal or pathological , as is the case of congenital scoliosis ( Pourquié , 2011 ) . At the same time , variations in archety - pal processes of body plan establishment are e . g . at the ori - gin of the variety of unique phenotypes of the many present - day strains of domesticated goldﬁsh Carassius auratus ( Abe et al . , 2014 ; Ota and Abe , 2016 ) . One central question in both developmental biology and animal evolution thus re - mains that of how changes in the spatiotemporal regulation of common developmental programmes can give rise to such a diversity of body forms from a single cell , the egg . A huge body of research pioneered and inspired by Ernest Everett Just has revealed over the years the dynamic pro - cesses involved in - and resulting from - the activation , fer - tilization , and patterning of the egg ( Byrnes and Newman , 2014 ) . E . E . Just advocated for melding of physics and bi - ology in the study of embryonic development ( Just , 1939 ) at a time when this was not common practice , and described the egg as " self - acting , self - regulating and self - realizing – an independently irritable system " , i . e . an excitable soft mat - ter ( Byrnes and Newman , 2014 ; Newman , 2009 ) . For in - stance , the egg exhibits dynamic changes of its cytoskeleton ( Just , 1919 , 1939 ; Santella and Chun , 2022 ) , and waves of dynamic calcium signaling during activation and fertilization ( Sardet et al . , 1998 ; Stricker , 1999 ) . These dynamics are now known to have the capacity to carry spatiotemporal informa - tion that pre - determines later developmental events , e . g . the site of gastrulation in ascidians ( Roegiers et al . , 1995 ; Sardet et al . , 2007 ) , and are linked to emergent contractile behavior of the egg ( Brownlee and Dale , 1990 ; Ishii and Tani , 2021 ; Kyozuka et al . , 2008 ; Limatola et al . , 2022 ) in both ascidian eggs ( Brownlee and Dale , 1990 ; Ishii and Tani , 2021 ) and in mouse oocytes ( Deguchi et al . , 2000 ) . Unlike the egg contractions mentioned above , which are short - lived and occur just after egg activation and fertiliza - tion ( Brownlee and Dale , 1990 ; Deguchi et al . , 2000 ; Ishii and Tani , 2021 ) , some eggs and embryos also display rhyth - mic contractions that last until much later stages of develop - ment . For example , cell - autonomous periodic cortical waves of contraction ( PeCoWaCo ) , linked to the softening of the ac - tomyosin cortex , are evident during the cleavage stages pre - Sanchez et al . | bioR χ iv | November 3 , 2023 | 1 – 26 ceding compaction in mouse embryos ( Maître et al . , 2015 ; Özgüç et al . , 2022 ) . Perhaps more strikingly , in goldﬁsh em - bryos rhythmic contractions of the yolk surface emerge from the 4 - cell stage and persist for hours until the epiboly stage of development ( Yamamoto , 1934 ) . These yolk contractions are faster at higher temperatures ( Yamamoto , 1934 ) , with tem - perature constants that cluster with those of processes that are mainly oxidative ( Crozier , 1924 ) and those of others that are primarily involved in growth and development ( Crozier , 1926 ) . The yolk of ﬁsh embryos has been shown to be more than just a static nutritional resource . In fact , experiments in both zebraﬁsh and goldﬁsh have shown that the yolk carries de - terminants for the establishment of the ﬁsh body plan , thus playing an active role in development and patterning . Specif - ically , the yolk has been shown to confer dorsal speciﬁcation cues to developing ﬁsh embryos ( Mizuno et al . , 1999 , 1997 ; Ober and Schulte - Merker , 1999 ) . According to the paradigm deﬁned in zebraﬁsh , shortly after egg activation and fertiliza - tion and prior to the ﬁrst cleavage a parallel array of micro - tubules that forms at the vegetal side of the yolk is crucial for the proper asymmetric transport of maternal dorsalizing determinants to the developing embryo’s prospective dorsal organizer ( Jesuthasan and Strähle , 1997 ; Tran et al . , 2012 ) . An analogous supply and asymmetrical partitioning of ma - ternal axial determinants has been equally inferred in goldﬁsh ( Mizuno et al . , 1997 ) . Interestingly , a wide variety of viable DV patterning pheno - types has been observed in ﬁsh . This is the case of the wide variety of median - ﬁn - related morphological phenotypes ( i . e . median ﬁn morphotypes ) of domesticated goldﬁsh strains , which have been shown to arise from altered DV pattern - ing during embryonic development . While there is evidence for an active role of the acellular yolk in this process , most studies on the matter have focused on underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms . It is now known that twin - tail goldﬁsh carry a mutation in one of their chordin genes ( i . e . chdS ) , which results in a non - functional truncated ChdS pro - tein ( Abe et al . , 2014 ) . Loss of function of said chordin gene , which naturally inhibits ventralization of the body ( Piccolo et al . , 1996 ; Sasai et al . , 1994 ) , is sufﬁcient to cause caudal ﬁn bifurcation in wild - type goldﬁsh ( Abe et al . , 2014 ; Lee et al . , 2023 ) , and this mutation has been also recently implicated in loss of dorsal ﬁn in dorsal ﬁnless goldﬁsh strains ( Chen et al . , 2022 ) . The spatiotemporal dynamics of the contractile gold - ﬁsh yolk remains understudied in goldﬁsh development and evolution , in particular , and in cell - developmental biology , in general . Here , we aim to investigate the dynamic , emergent behavior of the goldﬁsh yolk , hoping to learn more about its origin , its maintenance , and its role . In this manuscript , we share ﬁndings from our work addressing the following questions : • On origin and maintenance of yolk contractions : How do the rhythmic yolk contractions emerge ? How are they maintained ? • On mechanism and function of yolk contractions : Do the rhythmic yolk contractions have a function ? Do they permit the emergence of diverse median ﬁn mor - photypes ( DV patterning phenotypes ) in domesticated goldﬁsh ?

Results Extraction of yolk contraction timeseries from time - lapses of developing goldﬁsh embryos . We imaged de - veloping goldﬁsh embryos under the stereomicroscope and observed rhythmic yolk contractions starting at the 4 - cell stage and persisting until later stages ( Supplementary Movie M1 ) , as reported by Yamamoto ( 1934 ) . To quantify these contractions , we segmented the yolk and determined its cir - cularity , its perimeter , and its projected area over time . We compared these values with the mean pixel value of the em - bryo , circumscribed by its chorion , over time ( Figure 1A , Supplementary Movie M2 ) , reasoning that still - frames of an embryo at the same phase of the yolk contraction would be most similar , and hence would have similar mean pixel val - ues ( Figure 1 A1 and A3 , A2 and A4 , or A5 and A8 ) . We indeed noted that the mean pixel value of the embryo is a proxy of the projected area of the yolk , and henceforth used mean pixel value in our quantiﬁcation of the yolk contrac - tions . To analyze the contractions ( Figure 1B ) , we detrended the timeseries via sinc - ﬁlter detrending after specifying a cut - off period . We subjected the detrended timeseries to contin - uous wavelet transform using the Morlet wavelet as mother wavelet ( Mönke et al . , 2020 ) and then recovered the instanta - neous period , amplitude , and phase . Goldﬁsh , unlike closely - related carp and zebraﬁsh , ex - hibit persistent rhythmic yolk contractions during em - bryonic development . Having established a pipeline for the quantiﬁcation and analysis of yolk contractions from timelapse images , we compared goldﬁsh yolk dynamics with those of a closely - related species , carp , and of another cyr - priniform , zebraﬁsh ( Figure 1C - F , Supplementary Movie M3 ) . Persistent and periodic yolk contractions were evident in goldﬁsh embryos , but not in carp nor in zebraﬁsh ( Figure 1D ) . These contractions had a stable period of 135 ± 2 sec - onds ( 133 – 137 seconds ) , or ∼ 2 . 25 mins , from 01 : 45 : 00 to 02 : 34 : 50 hh : mm : ss post - fertilization ( n = 2 ) and have high wavelet power ( Figure 1E - F , Supplementary Figure F1 ) cor - relating well with considered wavelets and not with white noise ( Mönke et al . , 2020 ) . In zebraﬁsh and carp embryos , we instead only noted high - period ( or low - frequency ) rhythms at ∼ 12 . 5 mins , with period of 753 ± 4 seconds ( 749 – 757 sec - onds ) for carp ( n = 2 ) and 759 . 5 ± 28 . 5 seconds ( 733 – 820 2 | bioR χ iv Sanchez et al . | Rhythmic yolk contractions in goldﬁsh eggs and embryos 6300 . 0 6800 . 0 7300 . 0 7800 . 0 8300 . 0 8800 . 0 9300 . 0 TIME [ sec ] 600 650 700 750 800 PE R I O D [ s e c ] 6300 . 0 6800 . 0 7300 . 0 7800 . 0 8300 . 0 8800 . 0 9300 . 0 TIME [ sec ] 100 150 200 250 300 PE R I O D [ s e c ] 6300 . 0 6390 . 0 6480 . 0 6570 . 0 6660 . 0 6750 . 0 6840 . 0 6930 . 0 7020 . 0 7110 . 0 7200 . 0 7290 . 0 7380 . 0 7470 . 0 7560 . 0 7650 . 0 7740 . 0 7830 . 0 7920 . 0 8010 . 0 8100 . 0 8190 . 0 8280 . 0 8370 . 0 8460 . 0 8550 . 0 8640 . 0 8730 . 0 8820 . 0 8910 . 0 9000 . 0 9090 . 0 9180 . 0 9270 . 0 TIME [ sec ] 6300 . 0 6800 . 0 7300 . 0 7800 . 0 8300 . 0 8800 . 0 9300 . 0 TIME [ sec ] 0 . 7 0 . 8 6300 . 0 6800 . 0 7300 . 0 7800 . 0 8300 . 0 8800 . 0 9300 . 0 TIME [ sec ] 1100 1200 6300 . 0 6800 . 0 7300 . 0 7800 . 0 8300 . 0 8800 . 0 9300 . 0 TIME [ sec ] 74000 76000 78000 6300 . 0 6800 . 0 7300 . 0 7800 . 0 8300 . 0 8800 . 0 9300 . 0 TIME [ sec ] 180 182 184 A B 02 : 00 : 10 RA W Y O L K RA W T I M ESE R I ES D E T R E ND E D T I M ESE R I ES P HA SE s i n c - ﬁ l t e r de t r end i ng w a v e l e t ana l ys i s 02 : 01 : 20 02 : 02 : 20 02 : 03 : 30 02 : 26 : 30 02 : 27 : 20 02 : 28 : 10 02 : 28 : 50 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 E 5 8 6 7 1 2 3 4 D ZF x ZF C P x C P G F x G F F C I RCU L AR I T Y G F C P ZF P E R I M E T E R PX P R O J E C T E D AR E A , PX * PX M E AN PX V A L U E , PX CIRC PER 6300 6540 6780 7020 7260 7500 7740 T I M E [ s e c ] 7980 8220 8460 8700 8940 9180 0 . 75 1 . 00 N O R M VA L U E MEAN PX PROJ AREA 6300 . 0 6800 . 0 7300 . 0 7800 . 0 8300 . 0 8800 . 0 9300 . 0 180 182 184 M EA N P I XE L VA L U E [ p x ] . . .

We are not certain what these slow rhythms in carp and zebraﬁsh embryos are , but they could be related to the ongoing embryonic cell divisions , which take ∼ 25 mins in carp ( personal observations ) and ∼ 15 mins in zebraﬁsh ( Kane and Kimmel , 1993 ) . Nonetheless , such slow rhythms are clearly not the same as the persistent yolk contractions seen in goldﬁsh . The rhythmic contraction of the yolk is a trait that is maternal in origin . We next compared embryos of goldﬁsh , carp , and their hybrids ( Figure 2 ) . Speciﬁcally , we gener - ated reciprocal goldﬁsh - carp hybrids by artiﬁcial fertilization ( Tsai et al . , 2013 ) ( Figure 2A ) : ( a ) in one type of hybrids the egg was derived from goldﬁsh and the sperm from carp , while ( b ) in the other type of hybrids the egg was derived from carp and the sperm from goldﬁsh . We observed that yolk contractions were only detectable in embryos where the egg had been derived from goldﬁsh ( Figure 2B - C , Supple - mentary Movie M4 ) . We conclude that the contractions of the yolk are of maternal origin , i . e . whether or not yolk con - tractions emerge in ﬁsh embryos depends on the egg . The rhythmic contraction of the goldﬁsh yolk is inde - pendent from fertilization or cell division , and emerge at a precise time . After noting that goldﬁsh yolk contrac - tions are of maternal origin , we asked whether fertilization of the egg is required to trigger this phenomenon . To address this question , we compared fertilized and unfertilized gold - ﬁsh eggs ( Figure 3A ) . Remarkably , unfertilized goldﬁsh eggs not only showed rhythmic contractions ; these also emerge at around the same time as they do in fertilized eggs , which start at ∼ 4 - cell stage ( Figure 3B , Supplementary Movie M5 ) . Considering there is no real " 4 - cell " stage in unfertilized sam - ples , as they fail to undergo cell divisions ( Supplementary Movie M5 ) , these results hint to an intrinsic timing mecha - nism to the beginning of yolk contractions relative to a cer - tain reference " time 0 " that could be egg activation , which in turn is triggered by contact with water ( Lee et al . , 1999 ; Yamamoto , 1954 ) . Regardless , contractions of the yolk in unfertilized eggs persist for a long time until the cell eventu - ally dies ( Figure 3C - D , Supplementary Movie M5 ) . Notably , unfertilized samples tend to have faster contractions than fer - tilized ones ( Figure 3E ) . These data reveal that the contrac - tions of the yolk do not require sperm entry / fertilization , and that they are are also not due to cell division , further support - ing the idea that the goldﬁsh egg is an independently irritable system , i . e . it is excitable ( Newman , 2009 ) . Upon passing a threshold , possibly initiated at egg activation , goldﬁsh eggs are able to exhibit emergent contractile dynamics that persist for a long time . The rhythmic contraction of the goldﬁsh yolk does not depend on microtubule polymerization prior to ﬁrst cleavage , and is not sufﬁcient for proper DV pattern - ing . The formation of parallel array of microtubules at the vegetal yolk immediately after egg activation and fertiliza - tion , prior to the ﬁrst cleavage , is known to be crucial to the proper DV patterning of ﬁsh embryos ( Jesuthasan and Strähle , 1997 ; Tran et al . , 2012 ) . To investigate if goldﬁsh yolk contractions are linked to this process , we treated gold - ﬁsh embryos with nocodazole , a microtubule depolymeryz - ing drug ( Hoebeke et al . , 1976 ) . More precisely , at ∼ 10 mins post - fertilization ( mpf ) , we incubated goldﬁsh embryos in 0 . 1 µ g / mL nocodazole for ∼ 4 mins , as previously done in zebraﬁsh ( Jesuthasan and Strähle , 1997 ) . Yolk contractions persisted even after acute drug treatment ( Figure 4A , Supple - mentary Movie M6 ) . Incidentally , we also noted persistent contractions in yolk that pinched off from a dying treated embryo ( n = 4 , Supplementary Figure F2 , Supplementary Movie M6 06 : 00 : 00 to 06 : 40 : 00 hh : mm : ss post - fertilization , Supplementary Movie M7 ) . To verify the effectiveness of our drug treatment , we screened embryonic phenotypes at 1 - day post - fertilization ( dpf ) ( Figure 4B - C ) . As reported in zebraﬁsh ( Jesuthasan and Strähle , 1997 ) , acute treatment of goldﬁsh embryos with nocodazole prior to ﬁrst cleavage re - sulted in axis patterning defects and mostly ventralized phe - notypes ( Figure 4C ) . We have not veriﬁed the presence of a parallel array of microtubules in the vegetal yolk of goldﬁsh , as described in zebraﬁsh . Nonetheless , these results indicate that the contractions of the goldﬁsh yolk do not rely on a simi - lar microtubule assembly during early development . More in - terestingly to our investigation , these experiments reveal that rhythmic yolk contractions per se do not ensure ﬁdelity of axis patterning . Faster and / or stronger yolk contractions correlate with conditions resulting in ventralized phenotypes . Con - sidering the results of the previous experiments , we thought that perhaps what matters for proper DV patterning is not the presence or the absence of the yolk contractions , but rather the dynamics of these contractions .

While both conditions show per - sistent yolk contractions , the contractions in embryos treated with nocodazole ( n = 5 ) , which results in ventralized embryos at 1dpf ( Figure 4C ) , are faster ( i . e . they have lower period of 150 ± 2 seconds ( 133 – 152 seconds ) , Figure 4E ) and stronger ( i . e . they have higher amplitude of 1 . 46 ± 0 . 26 a . u . ( 1 . 05 – 1 . 76 a . u . ) , Figure 4F ) than their control counterparts ( with period of 164 ± 4 seconds ( 160 – 168 seconds ) and amplitude of 0 . 73 ± 0 . 17 a . u . ( 0 . 55 – 0 . 90 a . u . ) , n = 2 ) . We also compared wild - type goldﬁsh with twin - tail gold - ﬁsh Oranda , which is naturally more ventralized ( Abe et al . , 2014 ) . While the amplitude of the contractions are compara - ble ( i . e . the 95 % conﬁdence interval of the medians overlap ) between the two strains ( 0 . 94 ± 0 . 24 a . u . ( 0 . 7 – 1 . 18 a . u . , n = 2 ) for wild - type and 0 . 76 ± 0 . 18 a . u . ( 0 . 49 – 0 . 94 a . u . , n = 5 ) for twin - tail ) , yolk contractions in twin - tail embryos are faster than in wild - type ( Figure 5 , Supplementary Movie M9 ) with periods of 118 ± 1 seconds ( 116 – 125 seconds , n = 5 ) and 137 seconds ( n = 2 ) , respectively . Thus , in both aforementioned contexts , faster and / or stronger yolk contractions correlate with conditions that result in ven - tralized phenotypes . Discussion and open questions The egg exhibits a range of dynamic behaviors during de - velopment and patterning such as cytoskeletal reorganisation , calcium signaling oscillations , waves , and contractile behav - ior ( Brownlee and Dale , 1990 ; Deguchi et al . , 2000 ; Ishii and Tani , 2021 ; Just , 1919 , 1939 ; Kyozuka et al . , 2008 ; Lima - tola et al . , 2022 ; Santella and Chun , 2022 ; Sardet et al . , 1998 ; Stricker , 1999 ) most evident immediately after egg activation and fertilization . Remarkably , in goldﬁsh eggs and embryos ( but not in those of closely - related carp and zebraﬁsh ) rhyth - mic contractions of the yolk emerge after some time elapsed from egg activation and fertilization and persist until gastru - lation . These contractions are maternal and do not require sperm entry / fertilization nor cell division . Egg activation does not require sperm and will be initiated when goldﬁsh eggs contact water ( Lee et al . , 1999 ; Ya - mamoto , 1954 ) , thus possibly functioning as a trigger and " time 0 " reference for the emergence of yolk contractions even in unfertilized samples . We currently do not know why yolk contractions do not begin immediately after egg acti - vation but instead become apparent only at a precise time ( i . e . the 4 - cell stage of fertilized eggs ) . This could per - haps be related to the timing of the 4 - cell stage as a mile - stone in DV axis speciﬁcation .

In fer - tilized eggs , it eventually becomes asymmetrically localized in 4 - cell zebraﬁsh embryos ( Gore et al . , 2005 ) . Addition - ally , removal of the vegetal yolk after the 4 - cell stage via sur - gical bisection along the equator of ﬁsh embryos does not result in severe ventralized phenotypes in goldﬁsh ( as is in - stead the case when the vegetal yolk cell is removed at the 2 - cell stage Mizuno et al . ( 1997 ) ) , suggesting that a sufﬁcient amount of the maternal dorsal determinants have been trans - ported to the prospective dorsal organizer only by the 4 - cell stage . Whether or not this timing is linked to the appear - ance of rhythmic yolk contractions is still unclear . Do the yolk contractions need the entire time from egg activation to organize their machinery ( provided there is any ) ? Or do they already have the material / physical / chemical conditions for their execution early on , but “wait” until time equivalent to the 4 - cell stage ( e . g . until triggering of an activator and / or decay of an inhibitor ) ? We hypothesize that the yolk contractions in goldﬁsh are maintained by the cortical actomyosin network and / or cal - cium signaling . Both of these factors correlate spatiotempo - rally with contractile behavior in the ascidian egg after egg activation and fertilization ( Brownlee and Dale , 1990 ; Ishii and Tani , 2021 ) . Waves of calcium signaling are also in - volved in the deformation of mouse oocytes ( Deguchi et al . , 2000 ) and in the rhythmic contraction of the blastoderm in medaka embryos ( Simon and Cooper , 1995 ) . Softening of the cortical actomyosin network has also been recently impli - cated in the periodic cortical waves of contraction of mouse embryos prior to compaction ( Özgüç et al . , 2022 ) . That the contractions persist in isolated yolk , e . g . in yolk pinched off from a dying embryo ( Supplementary Figure F2 , Sup - plementary Movie M6 06 : 00 : 00 to 06 : 40 : 00 hh : mm : ss post - fertilization , Supplementary Movie M7 ) and in vegetal yolk separated from the rest of the embryo as described by Mizuno et al . ( 1997 ) , implies that the yolk itself is sufﬁcient to exhibit said dynamic behavior ( or that the yolk contractions do not rely on the embryo proper ) . Current knowledge on the link between cortical actomyosin , calcium signaling , and contrac - tile behavior mainly focus on these phenomena in cells . It is thus curious to further investigate if these three similarly act in concert in an acellular biological system like the yolk . Indeed , it has been shown that an actomyosin network is suf - ﬁcient to cause contractions in minimal synthetic models of cells . By tuning the ratio between actin and myosin , con - tractions can be induced in cortical actomyosin network re - constituted on a coverslip , in emulsion , or in lipid vesicles ( Litschel et al . , 2021 ; Miyazaki et al . , 2015 ; Tsai et al . , 2011 ) . 8 | bioR χ iv Sanchez et al . | Rhythmic yolk contractions in goldﬁsh eggs and embryos MATURE OOCYTE YOLK dorsal determinants parallelmicrotubulearray transport of dorsal determinants to prospective dorsal center VEGETAL POLE ANIMAL POLE DORSAL AFTER EGG ACTIVATION / FERTILIZATION . . . yolk contractions @ faster and / or stronger contractions @ PRIMED VENTRALIZED RHYTHMIC YOLK CONTRACTIONS AS STIRRER ? Fig . 6 . The rhythmic yolk contractions in goldﬁsh embryos could serve as a " stirrer " of dorsal determinants during DV patterning . After egg activation / fertilization , dorsal determinants deposited at the vegetal pole of mature ﬁsh oocytes are directed at an angle via a parallel microtubule array that forms at the vegetal side of the egg prior to the ﬁrst cleavage ( Jesuthasan and Strähle , 1997 ; Mizuno et al . , 1999 , 1997 ; Ober and Schulte - Merker , 1999 ; Tran et al . , 2012 ) . These determinants are then transported towards the animal pole , at the prospective dorsal center ( Ge et al . , 2014 ; Jesuthasan and Strähle , 1997 ; Tran et al . , 2012 ) . In the presence of rhythmic yolk contractions , as in goldﬁsh embryos , the transport of these dorsal determinants from the vegetal pole to their target site are likely disturbed . If yolk contractions serve as a " stirrer " , as previously suggested by Yamamoto ( 1934 ) , then they could be spreading the determinants to a broader area , which would result in dilution at the prospective dorsal region and could permit the emergence of more ventralized phenotypes . Scheme on top row is adapted and modiﬁed from Ge et al . ( 2014 ) ; Hibi et al . ( 2002 , 2018 ) ; Langdon and Mullins ( 2011 ) ; Nojima et al . ( 2010 ) . Contraction of the cortical actomyosin network in lipid vesi - cles could even result in surface deformations ( Litschel et al . , 2021 ) . These deformations are however not periodic , sug - gesting that additional factors are likely involved in periodic contractions like those of the goldﬁsh yolk . Indeed , linking actomyosin to calcium signaling in a theoretical model cap - tures periodic deformations of non - adhering ﬁbroblasts ( Sal - breux et al . , 2007 ) . In terms of the function of the goldﬁsh yolk contractions , we documented that conditions resulting in ventralized phe - notypes correlate with faster and / or stronger contractions . Could yolk contraction dynamics ( e . g . period and / or am - plitude ) then confer patterning cues to the developing ﬁsh embryo ? Considering that the yolk carries material crucial for embryonic patterning , could yolk contractions serve as a " stirrer " as already suggested by Yamamoto ( 1934 ) ? If the contractions serve as a stirrer , then they could be spread - ing maternally - derived dorsal determinants resulting in their dilution at the prospective dorsal organizer . This could be lowering the density of dorsalizing molecules available to counteract speciﬁcation of ventral fates , e . g . via maternal radar / gdf6a ( Goutel et al . , 2000 ; Rissi et al . , 1995 ; Sidi et al . , 2003 ) , therefore priming embryos for ventralization . In this " stirrer " framework ( Figure 6 ) , faster and / or stronger yolk contractions lead to further dilution of dorsal determinants and are thus correlated with more ventralized phenotypes . Interestingly , faster calcium transients have been recorded in hecate / grip2a zebraﬁsh mutants , which are ventralized ( Ge et al . , 2014 ; Gingerich et al . , 2005 ) . To the opposite , slow - ing down calcium transients via pharmacological perturba - tion of Ca 2 + release results in ectopic expression of the dor - sal marker chordin in zebraﬁsh ( Gingerich et al . , 2005 ; West - fall et al . , 2003 ) . In fact , the zebraﬁsh dorsal organizer has been shown to be a calcium pacemaker at the gastrula stage ( Chen et al . , 2017 ; Gilland et al . , 1999 ) . If calcium signaling is involved in goldﬁsh yolk contractions , could these contrac - tions be acting as an early determinant or an early readout of DV patterning in these ﬁsh ? In the presence of contrac - tions , could there be actual spatial spreading of maternally - derived dorsal determinants at the prospective dorsal orga - nizer ? And / or are there altered temporal dynamics between said molecules and target cells ? It would be curious to elu - cidate how this is orchestrated with cytoskeleton - dependent transport . Strikingly , altered DV patterning is implicated in the vari - ation of median ﬁn morphotypes in goldﬁsh , such as twin - tail ( Abe et al . , 2014 ) and dorsal - ﬁnless ( Chen et al . , 2022 ) . We documented here that embryos of Oranda , a twin - tail goldﬁsh strain , exhibit faster yolk contractions than wild - type goldﬁsh embryos , correlating faster and / or stronger contrac - tions to more ventralized phenotypes in alignment to our cur - rent framework . Periodic contractions of the yolk were doc - Sanchez et al . | Rhythmic yolk contractions in goldﬁsh eggs and embryos bioR χ iv | 9 umented in embryos of a few other ﬁsh , e . g . those of the Japanese iceﬁsh Salangichthys microdon ( Yamamoto , 1938 ) . However , when considering a closely - related species with the same ecological niche , we noted that carp does not show rhythmic yolk contractions as goldﬁsh . Could wild - type goldﬁsh therefore already be more ventralized than carp ? Interestingly , while it is easy to induce bifurcated tail ﬁn in wild - type goldﬁsh ( e . g . by injecting morpholinos target - ing chdS in embryos ) , similar ventralized phenotypes could not be achieved with carp ( Abe et al . , 2014 , 2016 ) . No - tably , when investigating reciprocal goldﬁsh - carp hybrids , we noted that rhythmic yolk contractions are present in hy - brids with egg derived from goldﬁsh . The egg cytoplasm was previously determined to impact traits ( e . g . vertebra number ) in goldﬁsh - carp hybrids ( Sun et al . , 2005 ) . Could hybrids ex - hibiting rhythmic yolk contractions then be more sensitive to perturbations resulting in bifurcated tail ﬁn ? Are these em - bryos primed for ventralization ? Could yolk contractions be permissive of the emergence of median ﬁn morphotypes ? Future perspectives Increasing sample numbers and comparisons between clutch - mates will be important to further strengthen the ﬁndings pre - sented here . Lengthening the timelapse imaging will also be necessary to better analyze the dynamics throughout devel - opment ( e . g . if / how the period of the contractions changes in a sample over time ) . We here propose further experimen - tal plans to address open questions mentioned in the current study , and aimed to further elucidate the origin , the mainte - nance , and the role of rhythmic yolk contractions in goldﬁsh . On investigating yolk contraction and its dynamics . Alternative ways to extract the timeseries could be consid - ered , especially those able to describe the yolk contractions in 3D . Through these more complete approaches , and per - haps in tandem with particle image velocimetry ( Özgüç et al . , 2022 ; Pereyra et al . , 2021 ) , one could more clearly relate the propagation and number of the waves of contractions to the position of the prospective dorsal organizer . This will neces - sitate imaging the embryo at higher spatial ( i . e . 3D ) and tem - poral ( contractions are at the 10 2 seconds range ) resolutions , requiring more sophisticated imaging modalities , likely at the expense of throughput . Quantitative measurements of the de - formability of the yolk and of other viscoelastic properties would also be informative and could be achieved through mi - cropipette aspiration ( Guevorkian and Maître , 2017 ) . In col - laboration with theoreticians , modeling and numerical exper - iments could be done , e . g . on linking dynamic phenomena to transfer of material from one part of a contracting / deformable sphere to another . On investigating cytoskeleton and its dynamics . To elucidate the contribution of the cytoskeleton on the rhyth - mic yolk contractions , it would be insightful to image and to quantify yolk contraction dynamics in goldﬁsh embryos treated with either latrunculin , which interferes with actin polymer assembly ( Spector et al . , 1983 ) , or blebbistatin , which disrupts interactions of actin and myosin ( Straight et al . , 2003 ) . Generation of transgenic goldﬁsh expressing an actin reporter , e . g . ﬂuorescent protein fused to actin - binding domain of utrophin ( Burkel et al . , 2007 ) , would be advan - tageous to study actin dynamics during yolk contractions . While CRISPR - Cas has been done in goldﬁsh ( Lee et al . , 2023 ; Yu et al . , 2022 ) , generation of the transgenic remains challenging due to the restricted spawning season of this ﬁsh . Alternatively , goldﬁsh embryos could be injected with ﬂu - orescent reporters of actin , e . g . ﬂuorescently labeled phal - loidin as done by Kyozuka et al . ( 2008 ) in starﬁsh oocytes or mRNA of LifeAct fused to a ﬂuorescent protein as done by Foster et al . ( 2022 ) also in starﬁsh oocytes , prior to timelapse imaging . Immunostaining ( e . g . with β - tubulin antibody and labeled phalloidin ) of ﬁxed goldﬁsh embryos could also be done to evaluate the organization of the cytoskeleton at dif - ferent phases of the yolk contractions . On investigating calcium signaling and its dynamics . To elucidate the contribution of calcium signaling on the rhythmic yolk contractions , it would be insightful to im - age and to quantify yolk contraction dynamics in goldﬁsh embryos treated with either phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) or bisindolylmaleimide I ( BIM ) , which have been shown to speed up and slow down Ca 2 + oscillations , respec - tively ( Halet et al . , 2004 ) . Generation of transgenic gold - ﬁsh expressing reporter of calcium signaling , e . g . GCaMP6s ( Chen et al . , 2013 ) , would be advantageous to study cal - cium signaling dynamics during yolk contractions . As an alternative to generating a transgenic reporter strain e . g . via CRISPR - Cas , goldﬁsh embryos could be injected with ﬂuo - rescent calcium indicators , e . g . Oregon green dextran ( OGD ) as done by Mohri and Kyozuka ( 2022 ) in starﬁsh oocytes , prior to timelapse imaging . On investigating early DV patterning in goldﬁsh em - bryos in relation to their yolk contractions . To relate the contraction of the yolk to DV patterning , and resolve their role as determinants or readouts , markers of DV pat - terning ( e . g . goosecoid , chordin , nuclear β - catenin ) could be used as additional readouts in the experiments cited above . The distribution of maternal dorsal determinants ( e . g . wnt8a RNA ) could be monitored either via in - situ hybridization of ﬁxed embryos at different cleavage stages or via imaging of ﬂuorescently - labeled wnt8a injected into live embryos , as done by Tran et al . ( 2012 ) in zebraﬁsh embryos . System - atic comparison of the dorsal organizer domain in contractile goldﬁsh and non - contractile carp would also be informative . Injection of chdS morpholino into goldﬁsh - carp hybrid em - bryos would resolve whether a bifurcated tail ﬁn can be in - duced in carp ( hybrids ) provided rhythmic yolk contractions occur . Methods Fish strains . Wild - type and twin - tail goldﬁsh were obtained from an aquarium supplier in Taiwan . Carp were obtained from local breeders or directly caught from the Erlong ( 二 龍 ) 10 | bioR χ iv Sanchez et al . | Rhythmic yolk contractions in goldﬁsh eggs and embryos river system in Yilan , Taiwan . Zebraﬁsh were obtained from the Taiwan Zebraﬁsh Core Facility at Academia Sinica ( TZ - CAS ) . All experiments were conducted according to guide - lines and upon approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) of Academia Sinica ( Protocol # 19 - 11 - 1351 and Protocol # 22 - 11 - 1922 ) . Artiﬁcial fertilization of goldﬁsh and carp eggs . During spawning season ( March to June ) , artiﬁcial fertilization was performed as described in Tsai et al . ( 2013 ) . Brieﬂy , on the night before artiﬁcial fertilization , mature goldﬁsh were in - jected with Ovaprim ( Syndel , US ) to stimulate production and maturation of gametes : ∼ 0 . 5 mL Ovaprim per kg of female ﬁsh and ∼ 0 . 1 mL Ovaprim per kg of male ﬁsh . Af - ter 12 - 16 hours , sperm and egg were collected . To collect sperm , male ﬁsh were gently squeezed near the cloaca and sperm was collected into labeled syringe pre - ﬁlled with Mod - iﬁed Kurokawa’s extender 2 solution . Sperm activity was as - sessed by diluting a drop of sperm with water on a coverslip and visualizing sperm motility under the microscope . After conﬁrming sperm activity , sperm was kept at 4 o C until use . To collect mature eggs , female ﬁsh was squeezed near the cloaca , which had been pat - dried , and eggs were collected onto PTFE dish . Adult ﬁsh were anesthetized in MS - 222 ( Supelco , # A5040 ) before handling , and were immediately allowed to recover in fresh tap water afterwards . Drops of sperm were mixed with the eggs and the mixture was transferred to labeled plastic dishes ( pre - coated with " Cha - Li - Wang” green tea ( 茶 裏 王 , Uni - President Corp . , Tai - wan ) to ease detachment of embryos from dish ) containing tap water . For experiments involving unfertilized eggs , eggs were immediately transferred to dish containing tap water , without addition of sperm . After around 5 mins , water was removed and the eggs were washed at least 5 times with tap water . Optionally , the eggs were bleached with 0 . 1 % ( v / v , 1 mL in 1 L ) bleach ( Magic Amah , Taiwan ) for 5 mins and quickly neutralized with 0 . 05 % ( w / v , 0 . 5 g in 1 L ) sodium thiosulfate prior to washing . Eggs and embryos were kept in tap water at room temperature ( ∼ 24 o C ) . Mating and embryo recovery of zebraﬁsh . On the late afternoon before mating , mature male ( 1 ) and female ( 1 - 2 ) zebraﬁsh were put in a mating tank and were separated by a physical barrier . At dawn , when the lights were turned on , the barrier was removed and ﬁsh were allowed to mate . Embryos were recovered ∼ 5 - 10 mins after egg release , washed with E3 medium , transferred to labeled plastic dish containing E3 , and incubated at room temperature ( ∼ 24 o C ) . Drug treatment . Stock solution of nocodazole ( 2 mg / mL ) was prepared by mixing 2 mg of nocodazole ( Sigma - Aldrich , # M1404 ) with 1 mL of DMSO ( J . T . Baker , # 9224 - 01 0121 24 ) . Working solutions were freshly prepared : 2 uL of 2 mg / mL nocodazole in 40 mL solution with tap water ( ﬁnal concentration = 0 . 1 µ g / mL nocodazole ) , and 2 uL of DMSO in 40 mL solution with tap water ( as control ) . As in Je - suthasan and Strähle ( 1997 ) , at ∼ 10 mpf ( after bleaching and neutralization ) , embryos were incubated in nocodazole ( or DMSO ) for ∼ 4 mins . After incubation , embryos were washed at least 5 times with tap water . Embryos were kept in tap water at room temperature ( ∼ 24 o C ) . Some embryos were subjected to timelapse imaging for analysis of yolk contrac - tion dynamics . The rest of the embryos were kept at 24 o C and their phenotypes were analyzed at 1 dpf . Imaging . Embryos were kept on the plastic dish and im - aged at room temperature ( ∼ 24 o C ) using either an Olym - pus SZX16 microscope equipped with a DP80 digital cam - era ( Olympus ) or an Olympus BX53 microscope equipped with a DP27 digital camera ( Olympus ) . To minimize evaporation of water , plastic dishes containing the em - bryos were covered with plastic lid that has a hole just on the ﬁeld of view . Timelapse images were taken using the Process Manager of cellSens Standard soft - ware ( Olympus ) with a temporal resolution of either 10 seconds or 1 min . Access to metadata of timelapse imaging is available in DATA - ImagingTimeseries at https : / / github . com / PGLSanchez / yolk - contractions . Data analysis . To extract the timeseries of yolk perime - ter , circularity , and projected area , segmentation was ﬁrst done using Simple Interactive Object Extraction ( SIOX ) plugin ( Friedland et al . , 2006 ) in Fiji ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) [ in Fiji : Plugins > Segmentation > SIOX : Simple Interactive Object Extraction ] . Us - ing one frame , multiple regions within the yolk were spec - iﬁed as foreground [ in SIOX : Foreground ] and seg - mented [ in SIOX : Segment ] . The segmentation infor - mation was then saved [ in SIOX : Save segmentator ] . This segmentation was then applied to the rest of the stack [ in Fiji : Plugins > Segmentation > Apply saved SIOX segmentator ] . A binary mask , corre - sponding to the yolk , was then created for each frame of the stack . The circularity , perimeter , and area of this mask over time was analyzed using a Fiji macro ( . ijm ) available at https : / / github . com / PGLSanchez / yolk - contractions , which it - erates Analyze > Measure over all frames in a stack . For most of the analyses , the timeseries of each sam - ple was extracted using Fiji by specifying a circular ROI marking the chorion and plotting the z - axis proﬁle [ in Fiji : Image > Stacks > Z Project ] , which plots the mean pixel value over time . When comparing con - ditions , samples with same hh : mm : ss post - fertilization ( or hh : mm : ss after exposure to water ) were considered which unfortunately restricted the sample numbers . Access to raw timeseries is available in DATA - ImagingTimeseries at https : / / github . com / PGLSanchez / yolk - contractions . Raw timeseries was detrended using sinc - ﬁlter detrending after specifying a cut - off period . The cut - off period was determined empirically , which was set to be 250 seconds for all analyses except when comparisons were done be - tween goldﬁsh , carp , and zebraﬁsh . Then , a cut - off pe - riod of 850 seconds was used to account for high - period rhythms in carp and zebraﬁsh . Detrended timeseries was Sanchez et al . | Rhythmic yolk contractions in goldﬁsh eggs and embryos bioR χ iv | 11 subjected to continuous wavelet transform ( with the Mor - let wavelet as mother wavelet ) using a wavelet analy - sis workﬂow ( Mönke et al . , 2020 ) , which is also imple - mented as a Python - based standalone software available at https : / / github . com / tensionhead / pyBOAT ( pyBOAT 0 . 9 . 11 ) . A ridge tracing maximum wavelet power for each time - point was detected and the instantaneous period , phase , and amplitude were extracted from this ridge . A high power ( power > 3 ) indicates strong correlation of the wavelet with the signal versus white noise . The Python code used in data analysis is available as a Jupyter notebook ( . ipynb ) at https : / / github . com / PGLSanchez / yolk - contractions . This code uses Matplotlib ( Hunter , 2007 ) , NumPy ( Harris et al . , 2020 ; Van Der Walt et al . , 2011 ) , pandas ( McKinney , 2010 ) , scikit - image ( Van der Walt et al . , 2014 ) , SciPy ( Virtanen et al . , 2020 ) , and seaborn ( Waskom , 2021 ) . For comparing the timeseries of embryo mean pixel value with the timeseries of yolk circularity , yolk perimeter , and yolk projected area , clustering was done on normalized time - series using seaborn . clustermap . For plots specifying one period per sample , estimation of the Fourier spectrum was done after wavelet analysis using py - BOAT 0 . 9 . 11 [ in pyBOAT 0 . 9 . 11 : Time Averaging > Estimate Fourier ] and the period with highest power was considered . For plots specifying one amplitude per sam - ple , the amplitude at timepoint with highest wavelet power was considered . These plots were generated - and sum - mary statistics were calculated using PlotsOfData ( Postma and Goedhart , 2019 ) , which is available as a Shiny app at https : / / huygens . science . uva . nl / PlotsOfData . Period and am - plitude were expressed as median ± median absolute devia - tion ( 95 % conﬁdence interval of the median ) when indicated in the text .
