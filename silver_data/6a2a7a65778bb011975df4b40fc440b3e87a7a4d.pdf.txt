Louis Missouri 63110 and the ¶ Department of Pharmacology , Duke University Medical Center , Durham , North Carolina 27710 The activity of the Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin - dependent pro - tein kinase IV / Gr ( CaMKIV / Gr ) is shown to be strictly regulated by phosphorylation of three residues both in vitro and in response to antigen receptor - mediated sig - naling in lymphocytes . One residue , Thr - 200 , is indis - pensable for enhancement of Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin - depend - ent basal activity by CaMKIV / Gr kinase . This event requires Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin in the full - length CaMKIV / Gr but is Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin - independent when a truncated version of CaMKIV / Gr is used as a substrate ( (cid:68) CaMKIV / Gr 1 – 317 ( (cid:68) 1 – 317 ) ) . The other two residues , Ser 12 and Ser 13 , are apparently autophosphorylated by the Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin - bound CaMKIV / Gr . Phosphorylation of nei - ther Ser 12 - Ser 13 nor Thr 312 ( the residue in a homologous position to Thr 286 of CaMKII (cid:97) influences the develop - ment of Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin - independent activity or any other property of CaMKIV / Gr examined . Similarly , re - moval of the NH 2 - terminal 20 amino acids has no effect on the activation or function of CaMKIV / Gr . However , mutation of both Ser 12 and Ser 13 residues to Ala in (cid:68) 1 – 317 completely abrogates activity , while individual sub - stitutions have no effect . These results indicate that the NH 2 - terminal Ser cluster mediates a novel type of in - trasteric inhibition and suggest that three events are required for CaMKIV / Gr activation : 1 ) Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin binding ; 2 ) phosphorylation of the Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin - bound enzyme on Thr 200 by a Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin - depend - ent protein kinase kinase ; and 3 ) autophosphorylation of Ser 12 - Ser 13 . This three - step requirement is unique among the multifunctional Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin - dependent kinases . The Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase type IV / Gr ( CaMKIV / Gr ) 1 is a developmentally regulated enzyme that is expressed predominantly in a subset of neurons , developing T lymphocytes and postmeiotic male germ cells ( 1 – 3 ) . This en - zyme has been implicated as a transducer of receptor - mediated Ca 2 (cid:49) signaling in T lymphocytes ( 4 , 5 ) . It is not found in primary B lymphocytes , but its expression is induced by trans - formation with the Epstein - Barr virus ( 6 ) . Whereas the phys - iologically relevant substrates have yet to be determined , CaMKIV / Gr is expressed in the nucleus and has been deter - mined to phosphorylate and regulate the transactivation func - tion of several transcription factors including cAMP - responsive element - binding protein ( CREB ) and cAMP - responsive ele - ment modulator (cid:116) ( CREM (cid:116) ) ( 7 – 12 ) and serum response factor ( SRF ) ( 8 , 13 ) . Although CaMKIV / Gr appears to be the product of a single gene in rat and human ( 14 , 15 ) , the protein exists in tissues as two monomeric forms , each of which binds to and is activated by Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin . It has been suggested that the larger (cid:98) monomer differs from the smaller (cid:97) monomer only by the presence of a unique 28 - amino acid NH 2 - terminal extension ( 16 ) , a postulate that is compatible with the structure of the gene ( 17 ) . However , expression in transformed cell lines of cDNA encoding the (cid:97) form of CaMKIV / Gr gives rise to two recombinant CaMKIV / Gr monomers that co - migrate with tis - sue - derived (cid:97) / (cid:98) monomers , indicating that the (cid:98) monomer may also result in part from post - translational modification of the (cid:97) form ( 6 ) . The catalytic region of the kinase is in the NH 2 - terminal half of the protein and is followed by an autoinhibi - tory calmodulin binding domain in a manner analogous to other members of the calmodulin - regulated kinase family ( 8 , 18 ) . It had been reported that following Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin binding , CaMKIV / Gr isolated from rat brain underwent a rapid auto - phosphorylation that resulted in the generation of Ca 2 (cid:49) / cal - modulin - independent activity ( 19 , 20 ) . Phosphorylation of the activated kinase was detected on multiple Ser residues within the NH 2 - terminal 20 amino acids as well as on Thr 196 and Thr 200 in subdomain VIII of the catalytic region of the kinase ( 21 ) . Subsequent experiments by a number of laboratories us - ing enzyme produced from recombinant cDNA expression vec - tors demonstrated that a CaMK kinase ( s ) was responsible for the initial phosphorylation of CaMKIV / Gr following Ca 2 (cid:49) / cal - modulin binding ( 18 , 22 – 24 ) . Selbert et al . ( 24 ) found that a CaMK kinase exclusively phosphorylated Thr 196 of the rat en - zyme , which markedly enhanced activity coincident with addi - tional phosphorylation on Ser residues and the appearance of some degree of autonomous activity . When Thr 196 was changed to Ala , neither phosphorylation nor activation of the enzyme occurred . It was concluded that the binding of Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin exposed Thr 196 to the activating CaMK kinase and that , when phosphorylated on this residue , the enzyme underwent auto - phosphorylation on Ser residues that led to generation of au - tonomous activity . The present study was undertaken to address the role of enzyme phosphorylation in regulating the activity of CaMKIV / Gr . We have examined the process in vitro using recombinant forms of the human enzyme as well as in a cellular model of CaMKIV / Gr activation . The results show that Thr 200 , the res - * This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health ( to T . C . , K . A . A . , and A . R . M . ) and the Keek Foundation ( to A .

The subsequent autophos - phorylation of the NH 2 - terminal Ser residues 12 and 13 may be involved in relief of autoinhibition by a novel mechanism but is not involved in generation of autonomous activity . MATERIALS AND METHODS cDNA Constructs— Human CaMKIV / Gr cDNA was derived and sub - cloned into the pSG5 vector as described ( 6 ) . (cid:68) 1 – 317 is a constitutively active deletion mutant of CaMKIV / Gr fitted with a FLAG epitope tag at the NH 2 terminus and subcloned into the Bgl II site of pSG5 . Substitu - tions at Ser 8 , Ser 10 , Ser 12 - Ser 13 , Ser 15 - Ser 16 , Lys 75 , and Thr 200 were introduced into the full - length kinase or into the (cid:68) 1 – 317 fragment by site - directed mutagenesis using the unique site elimination method ( 25 ) . The NH 2 - terminal deletion mutant (cid:68) CaMKIV / Gr 21 – 473 ( abbrevi - ated (cid:68) 21 – 473 ) lacks the first 20 amino acids of the wild type kinase and was subcloned by blunt end ligation into the Bam HI site of pSG5 . The CaMKIV / Gr mutant T312A and the (cid:68) 1 – 317 mutants S12A and S13A were generated by site - directed mutagenesis as described ( 26 ) . The cDNAs of all kinase mutants were sequenced and were confirmed to be free of errors . The plasmid AP - 1 luciferase contains two copies of the AP - 1 site of the rodent (cid:97) chorionic gonadotropin gene and was a kind gift of Dr . Kevin Chien ( University of California , San Diego ) ( 27 ) . Bacterial Expression and in Vitro Assay of CaMKIV / Gr Fusion Pro - teins— Recombinant proteins were expressed from pGEX2T plasmid ( Pharmacia Biotech Inc . ) in Escherichia coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) as glutathione S - transferase fusion proteins and purified in a single step with glutathione - Sepharose . Kinase activity was assayed by incubating fusion protein for 5 min at 30 °C , and 32 P - incorporation was determined following binding of the peptide to p81 phosphocellulose paper , as described previously ( 28 ) . The CaMK kinase used to activate CaMKIV / Gr was purified pig brain CaMKI (cid:97) kinase ( 29 ) , generously provided by Dr . Arthur Edelman ( State University of New York , Buf - falo , New York ) . In Vitro Transcription / Translation Studies— Two (cid:109) g of cDNA encod - ing either wild type or mutant CaM kinase IV / Gr proteins were tran - scribed and translated in vitro using the Promega TNT system ( Pro - mega Corp . ) as described by the manufacturer . The proteins were labeled during translation by including 4 (cid:109) Ci of [ 35 S ] methionine in the reaction mixture , and the labeled products were resolved on a 5 – 16 % denaturing acrylamide gradient gel . The gel was then dried , and the bands were visualized by autoradiography . Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays— BJAB is an Epstein - Barr virus - negative Burkitt lymphoma B cell line ( 30 ) that is responsive to signaling via surface IgM molecules ( 6 , 31 ) . 1 . 0 (cid:51) 10 7 BJAB cells were electroporated with 30 (cid:109) g of plasmid DNA in 0 . 4 ml of RPMI containing 10 % fetal calf serum using a Bio - Rad gene pulser at 220 V and 960 microfarads . For AP - 1 reporter assays , 2 (cid:109) g of the AP - 1 luciferase reporter was included in the transfection mix . Following transfection , BJAB cells were handled as detailed in the figure legends . For deter - mining reporter gene expression , cellular extracts were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity as described previously ( 32 ) . Immunoprecipitation— This was done as described previously using cells at 2 . 5 (cid:51) 10 7 / ml ( 4 , 6 ) . After lysis in an Nonidet P - 40 - containing buffer , supernatants were precleared overnight at 4 °C with 25 (cid:109) l of packed protein G - Sepharose ( Boehringer Mannheim ) precoated with normal rabbit serum . CaMKIV / Gr was then precipitated by incubating the precleared lysates for 4 h at 4 °Cwith 25 (cid:109) l of protein G - Sepharose precoated with an anti - CaMKIV / Gr antiserum directed against the COOH - terminal 17 amino acids of the human enzyme ( 33 ) . The beads were washed twice in a buffer containing 25 m M HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 5 m M EDTA , and 0 . 5 M NaCl followed by two additional washes in this buffer but without NaCl . The immunoprecipitates were assayed for enzymatic activity or subjected to immunoblotting as described below . Assay of CaMKIV / Gr Activity in Immunoprecipitates— Agarose beads containing CaMKIV / Gr immunoprecipitates were assayed for CaMKIV / Gr activity in 100 ml of a reaction mixture consisting of 25 m M HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 10 m M MgCl 2 , 50 (cid:109) M ATP , 4 (cid:109) Ci of [ (cid:103) - 32 P ] ATP , and 20 (cid:109) M of the substrate peptide syntide - 2 ( Bachem ) . Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin - de - pendent kinase activity was determined by including 5 m M CaCl 2 and 600 n M calmodulin ( Pharmacia Biotechnology Inc . ) in the reaction mix - ture , while autonomous activity was measured in the presence of 5 m M EGTA . The reaction was carried out for 10 min at 23 °C , following which 25 - (cid:109) l aliquots of the reaction mixture were spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose filters ( Whatman ) . The filters were washed three times in 0 . 5 % phosphoric acid , air - dried , and counted . Immunoblotting— This was performed using either CaMKIV / Gr - spe - cific polyclonal rabbit antiserum at 1 : 400 dilution to detect full - length kinase proteins or using the M2 anti - FLAG monoclonal antibody ( East - man Kodak Co . ) at 1 (cid:109) g / ml to detect (cid:68) 1 – 317 fragments . Following incubation with the appropriate secondary reagents , the blots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence system for peroxi - dase - based detection ( Amersham Corp . ) . RESULTS The structure of CaMKIV / Gr is depicted schematically in Fig . 1 A to illustrate the location and the nature of the muta - tions introduced ( 3 , 6 , 34 – 36 ) . Lying at the extreme NH 2 ter - minus are multiple Ser residues ( Ser 8 – Ser 16 ) , some of which have been previously shown to become autophosphorylated ( 21 , 37 ) . The Lys residue involved in ATP binding is Lys 75 ( K75 ) , and the Thr residue in the activation loop of the catalytic domain ( subdomain VIII ) which is phosphorylated by CaMKIV / Gr kinase is Thr 200 ( T200 ) . Thr 312 ( T312 ) exists in an analogous position relative to the CaM binding site , as does Thr 286 in CaMKII (cid:97) . It is the intersubunit phosphorylation of Thr 286 that is responsible for the generation of Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodu - lin - independent activity of CaMKII (cid:97) . Leu 317 is proximal to the CaM binding domain , and truncation at this residue has been shown to produce an enzyme that is independent of Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin ( 8 ) . This truncated fragment still requires phospho - rylation of Thr 200 for maximal activity ( 24 ) . In the full - length kinase , mutations were made by deleting the first 20 amino acids to generate (cid:68) 21 – 473 and also by individual conversion of Lys 75 into Glu ( K75E ) and Thr 200 or Thr 312 into Ala ( T200A and T312A , respectively ) . In addition we made a Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin - independent form of CaMKIV / Gr by truncating the protein at Leu - 317 to generate (cid:68) 1 – 317 . The following mutations , all Ala substitutions except Glu for Lys 75 , were introduced into (cid:68) 1 – 317 : Ser 8 , Ser 10 , Ser 12 - Ser 13 , Ser 15 - Ser 16 , Lys 75 , and Thr 200 . Each of the mutant cDNAs was incorporated into bacterial ( pGEX2T ) and eukaryotic cell ( pSG5 ) expression vector . The activity of the bacterially expressed full - length CaMKIV / Gr is compared with that of the full - length mutants in Fig . 1 B . Purified CaMKIV / Gr was preincubated in the absence or in the presence of CaMK kinase , as indicated , under condi - tions previously shown to result in maximal activation of CaMKIV / Gr by CaMK kinase . CaMKIV / Gr activity was then assayed in the presence of Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin or EGTA . The addition of Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin produces a small increase in ac - tivity , which is further enhanced 10 - fold by CaMK kinase to a specific activity of 1 . 8 (cid:109) mol min (cid:50) 1 mg (cid:50) 1 . Activation by CaMK kinase is accompanied by the generation of autonomous activ - ity amounting to 15 % of maximal activity . Neither removal of the first 20 amino acids nor conversion of Thr 312 to Ala ( T312A ) altered the activity generated under the four conditions rela - tive to the wild type enzyme . Mutations of Thr 200 to Ala ( T200A ) does not affect the Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin dependent in - crease in CaMKIV / Gr activity but completely abrogates the up - regulation of CaMKIV / Gr activity by the CaMK kinase . Conversion of Lys 75 to Glu ( K75E ) inactivates the enzyme regardless of the experimental conditions of the assay . The same constructs analyzed in Fig . 1 B were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pSG5 , and the encoded pro - teins were analyzed by in vitro transcription / translation and by transfection into the human Burkitt lymphoma B cell line BJAB , which lacks endogenous CaMKIV / Gr ( 6 ) . Fig . 2 A dem - onstrates that both wild type and mutant proteins were ex - pressed equally well when their respective cDNAs ( in pSG5 vector ) were subjected to in vitro transcription / translation . SDS - PAGE analysis revealed the wild type kinase , the T200A mutant and the K75E mutant to co - migrate at around 58 kDa while the (cid:68) 21 – 473 mutant migrated at around 56 kDa . Fig . 2 B reveals the expression of wild type and mutant CaMKIV / Gr Regulation of CaMKIV / Gr by Phosphorylation 21543 by gu e s t on J a nu a r y 24 , 2018 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m molecules at 48 h post - transfection in BJAB cells . Expression of the (cid:68) 21 – 473 mutant was comparable with that of the wild type kinase , while the levels of the T200A mutant achieved follow - ing transfection were markedly decreased at 30 – 50 % of wild type . Significantly , decreased expression was also observed in another mutant in which the conserved Lys 75 residue in the ATP binding pocket was replaced with a Glu . These results indicated that mutations that compromise kinase activity in - cluding T200A and K75E are associated with decreased expres - sion and / or stability in BJAB cells . Fig . 3 A demonstrates that wild type kinase immunoprecipi - tates isolated from unstimulated BJAB cells exhibited modest Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin - dependent catalytic activity toward the pep - tide substrate syntide - 2 . Stimulation with anti - IgM antibodies induced strong Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin - dependent activity in CaMKIV / Gr immunoprecipitates . Maximal kinase activation was achieved between 30 s and 1 min , but activity swiftly declined thereafter . Fig . 3 B demonstrates that CaMKIV / Gr wild type also exhibited appreciable autonomous activity in response to anti - IgM treatment , which followed a time course identical to that of the Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin - dependent activity . The Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin and autonomous activities of the (cid:68) 21 – 473 mutant were also up - regulated by anti - IgM treatment , and the magnitude and time course of this activation closely ap - proximated that of the wild type kinase . In contrast , treatment of BJAB cells expressing the T200A mutant with anti - IgM antibodies did not induce appreciable Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin - dependent or autonomous activity . The K75E mutant was de - void of inducible activity . For each kinase species equal amounts of protein were present in the immunoprecipitates as detected by immunoblotting with an anti - CaMKIV / Gr anti - serum ( data not shown ) , indicating that the up - regulation by anti - IgM of the activities of wild type kinase and (cid:68) 21 – 473 mutant was not due to the enhanced retrieval by immunopre - cipitation of the respective kinase species following anti - IgM treatment . These results reveal that Thr 200 is absolutely re - quired for both Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin - dependent and autonomous activation of CaMKIV / Gr in a cellular context and that the first 20 amino acids that contain the Ser residues known to be phosphorylated in vitro are not required for this activation . To determine whether phosphorylation of the Thr 200 or the NH 2 - terminal Ser residues influence a downstream effect of CaMKIV / Gr , we examined the ability of the T200A and (cid:68) 21 – 473 mutants to activate an AP - 1 reporter gene relative to the wild type kinase ( 38 ) . Fig . 4 demonstrates that overexpression of wild type kinase or the (cid:68) 21 – 473 mutant in BJAB cells results in the transcriptional activation of a luciferase reporter gene driven by an AP - 1 promoter . Moreover , induction of AP - 1 activity by both wild type kinase and the (cid:68) 21 – 473 mutant was increased about 2 - fold by anti - IgM treatment . In contrast , the T200A mutant failed to induce expression of the AP - 1 reporter in the absence or in the presence of anti - IgM antibodies . This result is in full agreement with the lack of inducible Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin activity of the T200A mutant both in vitro ( Fig . 1 B ) or in BJAB cells ( Fig . 3 ) . The similarity in behavior of the (cid:68) 21 – 473 mutant compared with the wild type enzyme was perplexing . This led us to further investigate the role of the NH 2 - terminal Ser residues F IG . 1 . Characterization of wild type and mutant CaMKIV / Gr - GST fusion proteins . A , schematic representation of CaMKIV / Gr structure . The general domain structure of CaMKIV / Gr is illustrated in the upper diagram . In the lower diagram the sites where point mutations ( S8 , S10 , S12 , S13 , S15 , S16 , K75 , T200 , and T312 ) and truncations ( A21 , L317 ) were made are indicated , along with the primary amino acid sequence at these sites . The sequence His 309 – Ala 329 is shown aligned with the similar sequence from CaM kinase II (cid:97) . B , activity of full - length wild type and mutant CaMKIV / Gr - GST fusion proteins . CaMKIV / Gr ( 4 (cid:109) g / ml ) was preincubated in the absence or presence of CaMK kinase ( 0 . 05 (cid:109) g / ml ) as indicated for 15 min at 30 °C . All preincubations also contained 10 m M MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 m M ATP , 1 m M CaCl 2 , and 1 (cid:109) M CaM . Peptide kinase activity was then measured as described under “Materials and Methods” using GS - 10 as substrate and in the presence of 1 m M CaCl 2 and 1 (cid:109) M calmodulin or in the presence of 2 m M EGTA , as indicated . C , activity of wild type and mutant (cid:68) 1 – 317 - GST fusion proteins . Activity was measured as in B . Values in B and C represent means (cid:54) S . E . ( n (cid:53) 4 ) . Regulation of CaMKIV / Gr by Phosphorylation 21544 by gu e s t on J a nu a r y 24 , 2018 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m by mutating to Ala individual Ser residues or pairs of Ser residues that occur at positions 8 , 10 , 12 , 13 , 15 , and 16 . These mutations were introduced into (cid:68) 1 – 317 ( see Fig . 1 A ) in order to separate the regulatory effects of the NH 2 - terminal Ser resi - dues from the autoinhibitory sequences present in the calmod - ulin binding domain of CaMKIV / Gr ( 8 , 18 ) . The resulting mu - tants were called S8A , S10A , S12A / S13A , and S15A / S16A , and the activity of this series of proteins produced in bacteria is shown in Fig . 1 C . The truncated version of the wild type en - zyme , (cid:68) 1 – 317 , was completely independent of Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin ( compare bars 1 and 2 ) but was stimulated 10 - fold by the CaMKIV / Gr kinase . All of the increased activity was independ - ent of Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin ( compare bars 3 and 4 ) . The mutant proteins containing Ala substitutions for Ser 8 , Ser 10 , or Ser 15 - Ser 16 behaved identically to (cid:68) 1 – 317 . However , the (cid:68) 1 – 317 S12A / S13A mutant showed no protein kinase activity under any of the four experimental conditions . The lack of kinase activity was similar to the results obtained with the inactive (cid:68) 1 - 317K75E mutant . Whereas the (cid:68) 1 – 317T200A mutant was resistant to activation by CaMK kinase , it did exhibit Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin - independent activity that was greater than that of either (cid:68) 1 – 317S12 / 13A or (cid:68) 1 – 317K75E mutant enzymes . We also evaluated the expression and function of wild type and mutant (cid:68) 1 – 317 proteins in eukaryotic cells . Fig . 5 A shows the expression of the Ser mutants in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system compared with the T200A and kinase - lacking ( K75E ) versions of (cid:68) 1 – 317 . It can be seen that each protein was effec - tively expressed in this coupled transcription / translation sys - tem . Wild type (cid:68) 1 – 317 as well as the S8A , S10A , and S15A / S16A mutants migrated as two closely spaced bands on SDS - PAGE . The (cid:68) 1 – 317 mutants S12A / S13A , K75E , and T200A exclusively migrated as the faster moving ( lower ) band . Since these mutants lack kinase activity ( Fig . 1 C ) , the upper band may represent an autophosphorylated form of the constitu - tively active kinase fragment . We next examined the expression of (cid:68) 1 – 317 and the set of mutants shown in Fig . 5 A in BJAB cells and also assessed their ability to stimulate the activity of the AP - 1 luciferase gene . Fig . 5 B demonstrates that substitutions that disrupt kinase activity including S12A / S13A , T200A , and K75E all resulted in poor expression as compared with the wild type (cid:68) 1 – 317 control . In contrast , the S15A / S16A mutant was expressed at levels com - parable with the wild type control . The S8A and S10A mutants were expressed at intermediate levels . Fig . 5 C demonstrates that the S8A , S10A , and S15A / S16A mutants induced lucifer - ase reporter gene transcription from an AP - 1 promoter at levels approximating 50 – 70 % that of the wild type (cid:68) 1 – 317 protein . In contrast , cells transfected with the (cid:68) 1 – 317 mutants S12 / 13A , T200A , and K75E showed no evidence of inducible , AP - 1 - driven gene transcription . Overall , these results indicate that Ser 12 F IG . 2 . Expression of wild type and mutant CaMKIV / Gr mole - cules in BJAB cells . A , in vitro transcription / translation of the vari - ous CaMKIV / Gr derivatives . In vitro transcribed and translated CaMKIV / Gr proteins were labeled during the translation process by including [ 35 S ] methionine in the transcription / translation reaction mix - ture and then resolved by SDS - PAGE and visualized by autoradiogra - phy . The wild type kinase , the T200A mutant , and the K75E mutant all co - migrated at about 58 kDa , while the (cid:68) 21 – 473 mutant migrated at about 56 kDa . Results are representative of three independent experi - ments . B , expression of CaMKIV / Gr derivatives in BJAB cells . BJAB cells were transfected with the indicated kinase construct . The cells were lysed 48 h later , and 100 (cid:109) g of protein present in the respective lysates was resolved by SDS - PAGE and probed for kinase expression using a rabbit anti - CaMKIV / Gr antiserum . Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence and autoradiography , as described under “Materials and Methods . ” Results are representa - tive of seven independent experiments .

A , Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin - dependent activity of the respective kinase species following treatment of transfected BJAB cells with anti - surface IgM antibodies ( anti (cid:109) ) . B , autonomous activity . BJAB cells ( total 3 (cid:51) 10 7 / kinase species ) were transfected with the indicated kinase species and cultured for 48 h . The cells were then harvested , divided into equal aliquots , and treated with goat anti - human IgM antibodies ( anti (cid:109) ) at 20 (cid:109) g / ml for the indicated time periods . The cells were then lysed , and wild type and mutant CaMKIV / Gr proteins were immunoprecipitated using a rabbit anti - CaMKIV / Gr antiserum . The immunoprecipitates were assayed for Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin - dependent kinase activity ( panel A ) or for autonomous activity ( panel B ) as described under “Materials and Methods . ” Results are expressed as pmol of 32 P incorporated into substrate peptide ( syn - tide - 2 ) over the 10 - min period of the assay . Results represent the mean of three replicates done for each time point ; S . E . values were less than 10 % of the means . Similar results were found in two other independent experiments .

The other NH 2 - terminal Ser residues may additionally contribute to the expression ( Ser 8 and Ser 10 ) and / or to the function of (cid:68) 1 – 317 in cells ( Ser 8 , Ser 10 , and Ser 15 - Ser 16 ) . To determine the individual contribution of Ser 12 and Ser 13 to the regulation of (cid:68) 1 – 317 , we generated (cid:68) 1 – 317 mutants carrying single Ala substitutions at either Ser residue . The mutants , termed S12A and S13A , were expressed as GST fu - sion proteins in bacteria , purified , and compared with the pa - rental (cid:68) 1 – 317 . Fig . 6 demonstrates that the kinase activity of the S12A and S13A mutants was indistinguishable from that of wild type (cid:68) 1 – 317 species , while the S12A / S13A double mutant was inactive . This indicated that the regulatory function ( s ) of Ser 12 - Ser 13 can be served by either one of the two residues . DISCUSSION Rat CaMKIV / Gr must be phosphorylated on Thr 196 in the activation loop by a CaMK kinase for maximal activity in vitro ( 24 ) . This site is masked in the full - length enzyme and is only exposed upon binding of Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin . Even when the en - zyme is rendered independent of Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin by removal of the Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin binding region , phosphorylation of Thr 196 is still required for maximal activity . Our studies reveal that the highly homologous human form of CaMKIV / Gr is similarly regulated in vitro by Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin binding fol - lowed by phosphorylation of Thr 200 ( the identical residue to rat Thr 196 ) . In addition , we have extended the relevance of a CaMKIV / Gr kinase and the importance of a Thr 200 phospho - rylation to a cellular context . When transfected into BJAB cells , Thr 200 is absolutely required for kinase activity measured in immunoprecipitates or for stimulation of a downstream tar - get of the CaMKIV / Gr signaling pathway , namely AP - 1 - medi - ated transcription ( 38 ) . A similar requirement for the homolo - gous Thr 196 residue of the rat enzyme has also been recently demonstrated in a cellular model of CaMKIV / Gr activation by Ca 2 (cid:49) ionophore treatment ( 39 ) . The presence of an activating kinase in BJAB cells raises the question of whether ( or how ) this enzyme participates in signal transduction cascades leading to CaMKIV / Gr activation . Two observations suggest that the activating kinase might be fully active in unstimulated BJAB cells . First , the capacity of (cid:68) 1 – 317 to induce AP - 1 - dependent transcription in unstimulated BJAB is independent of IgM treatment and is at least as great as that of the full - length kinase in IgM - stimulated cells . Sec - ond , transfection of the full - length kinase is sufficient to induce F IG . 4 . Activation of AP - 1 reporter expression in BJAB cells by wild type and mutant human CaMKIV / Gr . 1 (cid:51) 10 7 BJAB cells were transiently co - transfected by electroporation with 2 (cid:109) g of AP - 1 lucifer - ase reporter construct and 30 (cid:109) g of the indicated kinase construct . Following incubation for 24 h , the cells were resuspended in fresh medium and either left unstimulated or were treated with anti - IgM antibodies at 20 (cid:109) g / ml . The cells were cultured for an additional 5 h , after which they were harvested . Cell extracts were then derived and were assayed for luciferase activity . The results were normalized for the protein content of each sample and are expressed as light units / (cid:109) g of protein of cell extract .

Following incubation for 24 h , the cells were harvested , and the cytosolic proteins were extracted and assayed for luciferase activity .

Regulation of CaMKIV / Gr by Phosphorylation 21546 by gu e s t on J a nu a r y 24 , 2018 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m activity of the AP - 1 reporter gene in the absence of receptor - mediated activation ( although IgM treatment does result in a 2 - fold increase in reporter activity ) . A possible explanation for this observation is that transfection of the full - length enzyme results in the production of a small amount of a catalytically active but Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin - independent fragment due to pro - teolytic cleavage of recombinant CaMKIV / Gr . This is supported by our demonstration elsewhere that transfection of full - length CaMKIV / Gr into cells gives rise to small amounts of a recom - binant kinase fragment that co - migrates with (cid:68) 1 – 317 ( 38 ) . The original characterization of CaMKIV / Gr isolated from rat brain and subjected to Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin - dependent phos - phorylation in vitro identified several phosphoserine residues at the extreme NH 2 terminus ( see Fig . 1 A ) and a small number of phosphothreonine residues at positions 196 and 200 ( 21 ) . Subsequent experiments with enzymes produced from recom - binant cDNAs indicated that the initial activating phosphoryl - ation occurred on Thr 196 ( 24 ) and was catalyzed by a separate protein kinase that also exhibited Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin dependence in vitro ( 18 , 23 , 24 ) . Phosphorylation of Thr 196 resulted in further Ser phosphorylation and generation of autonomous activity . It seemed likely that the Ser phosphorylation occurred at the NH 2 terminus and that this phosphorylation was respon - sible for development of Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin - independent activity . Our results reveal that the mechanisms governing the activity of CaMKIV / Gr are considerably more complex than originally anticipated . First , the NH 2 - terminal Ser cluster is not involved with the development of autonomous activity . (cid:68) 21 – 473 be - haves in an identical manner to the wild type kinase both in vitro and in response to receptor stimulation . Both forms re - quire Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin and phosphorylation of Thr 200 for max - imal activity . Second , whereas the NH 2 - terminal Ser cluster was not required for Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin - dependent activation , phosphorylation of Thr 200 , or generation of autonomous activ - ity , Ser 12 and Ser 13 were indispensable for kinase activity under all conditions tested . Particularly striking was the be - havior of the constitutively active truncated CaMKIV / Gr frag - ment (cid:68) 1 – 317 . Even when this Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin - independent fragment was phosphorylated on Thr 200 by the activating ki - nase , no activity of CaMKIV / Gr was observed when both Ser 12 and Ser 13 were mutated into Ala . In contrast , single substitu - tions at Ser 12 or Ser 13 were indistinguishable from wild type (cid:68) 1 – 317 . These results suggest the presence of an additional autoinhibitory mechanism of the intrasteric type mediated by Ser 12 - Ser 13 that is relieved by phosphorylation of one or both residues . The (cid:97) , (cid:98) , and (cid:103) isoforms of protein kinase C and the related Raf kinases represent precedents for the location of an autoinhibitory domain at the NH 2 terminus of a protein kinase ( 40 ) . Like CaMKIV / Gr , protein kinase C autophosphorylates on multiple amino acids , including residues at the NH 2 terminus ( Ser 16 and Thr 17 ) , although the functional significance of these events has not been determined ( 41 ) . Our results suggest that activation of CaMKIV / Gr would consist of three possibly cooperative events : 1 ) Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin binding , 2 ) phosphorylation of Thr 200 by CaMKIV / Gr kinase , and 3 ) autophosphorylation on Ser 12 - Ser 13 . The following ob - servations suggest that the phosphorylation events triggered by CaM binding may not be strictly ordered . First , purified CaMK kinase can phosphorylate the inactive CaMKIV / Gr K75E mutant , 2 indicating that phosphorylation of Thr 200 can occur in the absence of phosphorylated Ser 12 - Ser 13 . Second , as described above , mutagenesis of Ser 12 and Ser 13 to Ala results in an enzyme incapable of generating CaM - dependent basal activity , while the T200A mutant retains this ability . These results suggest that calmodulin binding , in the context of the wild type enzyme , is sufficient to trigger autophosphorylation of Ser 12 - Ser 13 in the absence of phosphorylated Thr 200 . This autophosphorylation relieves autoinhibition and generates ba - sal enzymatic activity . In the case of CaMKII (cid:97) , binding of Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin to one subunit is sufficient to relieve autoinihibition without inducing autophosphorylation . However , binding of Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin to two contiguous subunits results in the phosphorylation of Thr 286 on one of the subunits . This phosphorylation is respon - sible for development of autonomous kinase activity ( 42 – 45 ) and a 1000 - fold increase in the affinity of Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin to the autophosphorylated subunit ( 46 ) . CaMKIV / Gr does have a Thr residue ( Thr 312 ; Fig . 1 A ) at a position identical to Thr 286 of CaMKII (cid:97) . Tokumitsu et al . ( 18 ) initially implicated this resi - due as important for development of autonomous activity in CaMKIV / Gr , since introduction of negatively charged residues surrounding Thr 312 did result in the appearance of Ca 2 (cid:49) / cal - modulin - independent activity . On the other hand , our results as well as those of Tokumitsu and Soderling ( 39 ) demonstrate that mutation of Thr 312 to Ala ( T312A ; Fig . 1 B ) is not sufficient to generate autonomous activity either in the absence or pres - ence of the CaMK kinase activator and , in fact , does not change the activity of the enzyme relative to those of the wild - type enzyme . While the mechanism for generation of autonomy in CaMKIV / Gr is currently unclear , one can speculate that a residue ( or residues ) that has yet to be identified becomes autophosphorylated in the activated enzyme and mediates au - tonomy . Alternatively , it is possible that phosphorylation of Thr 200 is in itself capable of generating autonomy . In such a scenario , a lowering of Ca 2 (cid:49) would release calmodulin , but as long as Thr 200 remained phosphorylated the calmodulin bind - ing domain could not reconfigure to completely inactivate the enzyme . Experiments are currently under way to evaluate these possibilities . Acknowledgments— We thank Sara S . Hook and Jonathan . D . Gitlin for helpful discussions .
