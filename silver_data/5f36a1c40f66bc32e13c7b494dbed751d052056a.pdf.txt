Methods We retrospectively identified COVID - 19 - related deaths reported between March 1 st 2020 and December 13 th 2021 from the Connecticut Electronic Disease Surveillance System and determined residential status according to recorded address ( Supplement ) . 5 , 6 For the population residing in non - congregate settings , we estimated age - adjusted mortality for composite race and ethnicity categories ( Hispanic , non - Hispanic Black and non - Hispanic White ) using 2019 census estimates ( Supplement ) . 5 We estimated age - adjusted mortality rate ratios ( MRR ) for Hispanic and non - Hispanic Blacks , relative to non - Hispanic Whites , for three periods ( March 1 , 2020 – August 25 , 2020 , August 26 , 2020 – July 12 , 2021 and July 13 , 2021 – December 13 , 2021 ; Figure . C ; Supplement ) , each of which encompassed an epidemic wave , and tested for changes in MRR using a Poisson Regression .

Congregate facility - associated deaths accounted for 74 . 6 % ( 3205 / 4299 ) , 37 . 7 % ( 1341 / 3557 ) and 14 . 2 % ( 84 / 590 ) of deaths in the 1 st , 2 nd , and 3 rd periods , respectively ( Figure . A ) . Among congregate facility - associated deaths , 5 . 6 % ( 259 ) , 10 . 0 % ( 463 ) and 84 . 4 % ( 3 , 908 ) were Hispanic , non - Hispanic Black and non - Hispanic White , respectively . The characteristics of deaths among residents of non - congregate settings are shown in the Table . Overall , age - adjusted mortality among residents of non - congregate settings was highest for Hispanics ( 19 . 6 / 100 , 000 population - months ) , followed by non - Hispanic Blacks ( 17 . 3 / 100 , 000 population - months ) and non - Hispanic Whites ( 6 . 4 / 100 , 000 population - months ) . During the 1 st period , non - Hispanic Blacks had a 5 . 2 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 4 . 5 - 5 . 9 ) times higher mortality than non - Hispanic Whites . However , during the 3 rd period , the disparity decreased by 80 % and mortality between non - Hispanic Blacks and non - Hispanic Whites did not differ significantly ( MRR : 1 . 3 [ 0 . 9 - 1 . 7 ] ) . Although Hispanics had a lower MRR ( 3 . 9 [ 3 . 3 - 4 . 5 ] ) than non - Hispanic Blacks during the 1 st period , they had higher MRR during the 2 nd and 3 rd periods . Mortality for Hispanics remained significantly higher than for non - Hispanic Whites during the 3 rd period ( MRR 1 . 9 [ 1 . 5 - 2 . 5 ] ; Figure / Table ) . Discussion All rights reserved .

The high magnitude of these disparities compared with those reported during similar periods from other US regions ( MRR 1 . 2 - 4 . 0 ) 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 indicates that the disaggregation of congregate - facility events may reveal levels of disparity not previously appreciated . Our findings suggest that attenuation of racial and ethnic disparities is an achievable public health goal . We observed a decline in disparities in COVID - 19 - related mortality , as found in prior studies . 1 , 3 . While we found no significant difference in the COVID - 19 - related mortality between non - Hispanic Blacks and non - Hispanic Whites during the 3 rd pandemic period , significant disparities remained between Hispanics and non - Hispanic Whites . The limitations of our analysis include the use of a COVID - 19 - related death endpoint and the potential for misclassification of race , ethnicity and residency status . Further investigations are needed to disentangle the role interventions , such as social protection programs , testing and vaccination , had on reducing disparities in COVID - 19 mortality , which may inform effective , generalizable policies targeting the health equity challenge posed by the pandemic .

However , these estimates of age - adjusted rates are a reasonable approximation since congregate residential populations account for approximately 1 % of the Connecticut population . 1 .

The three waves occurred in the spring of 2020 , fall of 2020 through spring of 2021 , and fall of 2021 through the end of the study period ( December 13 , 2021 ) . The two nadirs were on August 25 th , 2020 , and July 12 th , 2021 , corresponding with 7 - day rolling average death counts of 1 . 13 and 1 . 29 , respectively . All rights reserved .

At the beginning of the pandemic , COVID - 19 cases and deaths were defined by DPH as congregate setting residents if the geocoded residential address extracted from the Connecticut Electronic Disease Surveillance System fell within 150 feet of a registered congregate setting . As of February 2021 , DPH used address - based text - matching to registered congregate settings as the method of identifying COVID - 19 cases and deaths in congregate facility residences .
