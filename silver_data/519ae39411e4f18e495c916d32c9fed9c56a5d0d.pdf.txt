Results Of the 2097 proteins identified by proteomic analysis , 398 proteins were significantly different between CYS and HC . Of those , 191 were involved in transport processes and 61 in inflammatory responses . The majority were vesicle - mediated transport proteins ( 78 . 5 % ) , and 1 / 3 of them were down - regulated ; of those , 12 proteins were involved in endosomal transport ( including 6 charged multivesicular body proteins ( CHMP ) and 3 vacuolar sorting - associated proteins ) and 9 in transmembrane transport . Myosin - 2 and two actin - related proteins were significantly up - regulated in the vesicle - mediated transport group . Conclusion We provide proteomic evidence of impaired endocytosis , dysregulation of actin and myosin cytoskeleton , and inflammation in CYS . Endosomal transport proteins were down - regulated mainly through defective CHMP .

Keywords Nephrolithiasis · Cystinuria · Urine · Proteomics Introduction Cystinuria is a rare genetic disease that is characterized by impaired transport of cystine and dibasic amino acids in the proximal renal tubule [ 1 ] . About half of all cases are trans - mitted in an autosomal recessive fashion , caused by muta - tions in the SLC3A1 gene . This gene encodes rBAT , one of the two protein components of the neutral and basic amino acid transporter [ 2 ] . The other half are autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance , caused by mutations in SLC7A9 gene , which encodes the light component , the catalytic pro - tein , of the transporter , b 0 , + AT . Patients with cystinuria often present with kidney stones owing to the low solubility of cystine in urine . Their likeli - hood of forming stones is about 50 % [ 3 ] . Cystine stones are large and bilateral in the majority of cases . Even though cystine stones represent only 1 – 2 % of all cases with stones , Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article ( https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1007 / s1125 5 - 018 - 2044 - 1 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users . * Larisa Kovacevic lkovacev @ dmc . org 1 Department of Pediatric Urology , Children’s Hospital of Michigan , 3901 Beaubien Blvd , Detroit , MI 48201 , USA 2 Institute of Environmental Health Sciences , Wayne State University , Detroit , MI , USA 3 Vattikuti Urology Institute , Henri Ford Hospital , Detroit , MI , USA 4 Nephrology Division , New York University Langone Medical Center , New York , NY , USA 594 International Urology and Nephrology ( 2019 ) 51 : 593 – 599 1 3 the morbidity is high due to increased recurrence rate , need for multiple surgeries and the risk of developing chronic kidney disease [ 4 ] . Renal function in patients with cystine kidney stones is reduced compared to those with non - cystine stones [ 5 ] , but the cause of this decline is not entirely clear . The gene mutations identified in cystinuria cannot fully explain kidney stone activity . It has been shown that not all patients with two mutated SLC3A1 genes will form a stone . Additionally , patients with identical SLC3A1 or SLC7A9 genotypes may have onset of stone disease at different ages and with different severity . Therefore , other unidentified fac - tors seem to contribute to kidney stone formation . These factors may include endogenous proteins that could serve as promoters or inhibitors of cystine precipitation , aggrega - tion or epithelial adherence . Proteomics allows simultaneous examination of the patterns of multiple urinary proteins and has become one of the most promising tools in nephrology and urology [ 6 , 7 ] . Using a proteomic approach , we aimed to assess the differences in the concentration and function of urinary proteins between cystinuria and renal stones ( CYS ) and healthy controls ( HC ) . We postulated that CYS and HC groups would demonstrate different proteomic profiles . We also presumed that CYS patients would have a significant number of proteins involved in abnormal cellular processes including stress , inflammation and immune response , as well as others yet to be identified . Methods We compared urinary proteomes of 10 patients with CYS and 10 age - and gender - matched HC , using liquid chroma - tography - mass spectrometry ( LC – MS / MS ) . Patient selection We prospectively enrolled 10 consecutive patients with CYS ( 35 . 4 ± 11 . 2 years , 5 males and 5 females ) who presented for routine follow - up visit at New York University Langone Medical Center 9 patients ) , and at Children’s Hospital of Michigan ( 1 patient ) . All were established patients with cystinuria who had a history of nephrolithiasis . The diagno - sis of cystinuria was made when a stone composed of cystine was obtained , and confirmed when urine cystine levels were found to be higher than 75 mg in a 24 - h urine collection analyzed by Litholink Corporation ( LabCorp , Chicago , IL ) . Random mid - stream fresh urine samples were collected from all participants . At the time of urine collection , patients were asymptomatic ( i . e . , were not experiencing episodes of urinary tract obstruction and / or urinary tract infections ) , and were not taking antibiotics . The patients were taking citrate ( 9 / 10 ) , tiopronin ( 5 / 10 ) , or d - penicillamine ( 2 / 10 ) . HC group consisted of 10 age - and gender - matched vol - unteer individuals . Random mid - stream fresh urine samples were collected after a detailed history and physical examina - tion was performed . The HC participants denied history of kidney stones , had normal urinalysis by dipstick and were not taking any medications . The urine was obtained for rou - tine urinalysis for clinical care , and would have then been discarded ; it was sent to the proteomics laboratory without any personal health identification information . Under these circumstances , analysis of the urine is not considered human subjects research . Sample collection and preparation Random mid - stream fresh urine samples were obtained in sterile cups , prepared within 3 h of collection ( centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 15 min ) at both institutions and stored as recommended by standardized protocols ( developed by the Human Urine and Kidney Proteome Project , HUKPP , and the European Urine and Kidney Proteomics , EuroKUP Initi - atives ) until use [ 8 ] . Following preparation at NYU , de - iden - tified urine specimens and data were sent to our institution . Aliquots were stored at − 80 °C until all urine specimens were received and processed for proteomic analysis . Each aliquot was used just once . Proteins in each sample were concentrated in a Centricon - type filter . Albumin and IgG were removed by anti - HAS / IgG resin ( Sartorius ) . Protein concentration in each sample was measured by the BCA protein assay ( Pierce ) . Protein digestion and tandem mass tag ( TMT ) labeling For HC and CYS groups , 10 µg of depleted urine protein from 10 individual samples were pooled together for 100 µg total , and then dried . Samples were resuspended in 10 µl of 1 % SDS , and denatured for 5 min at 95 °C . Samples were reduced with 2 mM DTT in 50 mM TEAB for 30 min at 65 °C , followed by alkylation with 6 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at RT . Proteins were digested with 2 µg trypsin overnight at 37 °C . Each sample was uniquely labeled using an isobaric TMT tag ( Pierce , 1 . 2 mg ) in 50 % acetonitrile for 1 h at RT , followed by quenching with 0 . 5 % hydroxy - lamine . Samples were purified over detergent - removal col - umns ( Pierce ) and dried . 2D LC – MS / MS Peptides were resuspended in 5 % acetonitrile / 0 . 1 % formic acid / 0 . 005 % trifluoroacetic acid and desalted / separated over a 5 - µm reverse phase PLRP - S column ( Agilent ) using mobile phases A ( 2 % acetonitrile ) and B ( 98 % acetonitrile ) , with both buffers adjusted to pH 10 . 0 using ammonium 595 International Urology and Nephrology ( 2019 ) 51 : 593 – 599 1 3 hydroxide . Thirty first dimension fractions were collected using a TriVersa NanoMate ( Advion ) system paired to a LTQ - XL mass spectrometer ( Thermo ) . Second dimension peptide separation was performed using reverse phase chro - matography ( Acclaim PepMap RSLC column , Thermo ) under acidic conditions ( 0 . 1 % formic acid ) with an EASY nLC - 1000 uHPLC system ( Thermo ) . Peptides were sepa - rated over a 90 - min gradient and analyzed with an OrbiTrap Fusion mass spectrometer ( Thermo ) . MS1 scans were per - formed in profile mode in the orbitrap at 120 , 000 resolution . Data - dependent MS2 acquisitions were triggered on the top 10 most abundant ions ( charge states 2 – 7 ) and fragmented using CID at 35 % collision energy in the linear ion trap . Dynamic exclusion was turned on ( 40 s ) . TMT tag quanti - tative was obtained in MS3 using Synchronous Precursor Selection . For this scan , the top 10 fragment ions were frag - mented using HCD at 65 % collision energy in the orbitrap at a resolution of 60 , 000 and m / z range of 100 – 500 . Protein identification and quantitation LC – MS / MS data were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer ( Thermo , version 1 . 4 ) . Peptide identifications were scored using Sequest HT against a reviewed human protein data - base ( Uniprot ; downloaded on 2018 - 04 - 06 ; 20 , 260 entries ) and simultaneously against a matched decoy database to determine the false discovery rate ( FDR ) . Searches included up to 2 missed tryptic cleavages and 10 PPM / 0 . 6 Da mass tolerances for parent and fragment ions , respectively . TMT label on peptide N - termini and internal lysine residues , and iodoacetamide derivative of cysteine were specified as fixed modifications . Oxidation of methionine was specified as a variable modification . Peptides were considered a positive identification if they achieved a ≤ 0 . 1 FDR using the Percola - tor algorithm . Ratios of reporter intensities were calculated as CYS / HC , and p values were calculated using a modified Fisher’s exact test . Proteins were considered significant if they displayed a ≥ twofold increase or decrease in abundance compared with controls , contained at least 2 unique peptide identifications , and had a p value of ≤ 0 . 05 . Pathway analysis Proteins which met these criteria were analyzed for inclusion into Gene Ontology ( GO ) classifications . GO is a bioinfor - matics platform which provides a statistical likelihood that a group of proteins are enriched within a specific biological classification . Protein interaction mapping was used to create a network that indicates the relationship between proteins with increased or decreased abundance using the Reactome FI plugin for Cytoscape ( version 3 . 5 ) . Results Patient’s characteristics Serum creatinine values were available in 6 out of the 10 CYS patients , with a mean of 1 . 09 ± 0 . 31 mg / dl ( range 0 . 71 – 1 . 59 mg / dl ) . Mean eGFR for these patients was 92 ± 38 . 1 ml / min / 1 . 73 m 2 ( range 46 – 146 ml / min / 1 . 73 m 2 ) . The data regarding comorbidities were available only in 1 patient and included obesity . However , CYS was repre - sented by a relatively young group of people who , besides having cystinuria , are relatively healthy . None of the HC had any comorbidities and their serum creatinine concen - trations were not checked . Proteomic analysis A total of 2097 proteins were identified by proteomic anal - ysis . Of those , 398 proteins ( 216 up - regulated and 182 down - regulated ) were found to be significantly different between CYS and HC . These significantly and differen - tially abundant proteins were used to analyze the group differences for biological processes . The top 7 most rele - vant biological processes over - represented in CYS patients compared to controls by GO analysis are shown in Fig . 1 . Nearly half of proteins identified in CYS group ( 191 out of 398 ) were found to participate in transport processes . The majority of transport proteins were involved in vesicle - mediated transport ( 150 out of 191 ) ( Fig . 2 ) , and 1 / 3 of them were down - regulated ( 49 / 150 ) ( Table 1 , Supplemen - tary Material ) . Of those 49 , 12 proteins were involved in endosomal transport ( Table 1 ) , 9 in transmembrane trans - port ( Table 2 ) , and two were Ras - related proteins , RALA and Rab 5C . Among endosomal transport - related proteins , there were 6 charged multivesicular body protein ( CHMP 1A , 1B , 2A , 2B , 4B , and 12A ) and 3 vacuolar sorting - asso - ciated proteins ( 4B , 37D , VTA ) . Myosin - 2 ( ratio 12 . 86 ) and two actin - related proteins ( subunit 2 , ratio 7 . 62 and subunit 1B , ratio 4 . 9 ) were highly represented among up - regulated proteins in the vesicle - mediated transport group . A large number of proteins were found to be involved in inflammation ( 56 up - regulated and 5 down - regulated proteins ) and immune response ( 98 up - regulated and 41 down - regulated ) ( Table 2 , Supplementary Material ) , and 52 of those were related to complement activation . We identified 10 complement proteins ( C1 - C9 and comple - ment factor I ) . Of those , C1 was the most abundant with all 3 subunits C1Q , R , and S being over - represented in CYS group . Protein – protein interaction network modeling of pro - teins with overall increased and decreased abundance in 596 International Urology and Nephrology ( 2019 ) 51 : 593 – 599 1 3 CYS patients compared to HC is shown in Figure of sup - plementary material . In this representation , proteins are shown as key nodes or clusters , and known interactions are shown as edges . Consensus GO term for each cluster revealed six biological processes that play a major role in CYS patients : ( 1 ) complement activation , ( 2 ) regulation of complement activation , ( 3 ) endosomal transport , ( 4 ) receptor - mediated endocytosis , ( 5 ) extracellular matrix Fig . 1 Gene ontology ( GO ) analysis of urinary proteins with rela - tive increased ( green ) or decreased ( red ) abundance in adults with cystinuria ( Cys ) and kidney stones compared to healthy adults .

Of those , there were two major down - regulated processes , endosomal transport and G protein coupled receptor sign - aling pathways . Complement activation and receptor medi - ated endocytosis were the major up - regulated processes , while extracellular matrix organization included both up - and down - regulated proteins . Discussion In this study , we demonstrate that patients with CYS have a different urine proteomic profile than HC , as hypothesized . Our finding that the transport of proteins is one of the most significant biological processes affected in patients with cystinuria is not surprising , since cystinuria is a disease caused by a defective transport protein . Among various forms of transport , we detected a significant number of uri - nary proteins involved in vesicle - mediated transport . As part of these transport processes , almost all proteins that partici - pate in endosomal transport were down - regulated . Among those , there were six down - regulated multivesicular bodies proteins ( CHMP ) , and three vacuolar proteins . All these pro - teins were part of the endosomal transport cluster in the pro - tein mapping , suggesting their interaction . Rab - related pro - tein , another protein involved in vesicle - mediated transport [ 9 ] , was also found to be down - regulated . All these proteins are part of the endocytic pathway and mediate autophagy [ 9 ] . CHMP play an essential role in destroying damaged proteins and other particles by incorporating them into intra - luminal vesicles and by fusing with lysosomes [ 9 ] . CHMP contain endocytic markers such as Rabs , small GTP - bind - ing proteins that participate in the proximal tubule apical endocytic cascade . Additionally , endocytosis is dependent on the integrity of the actin and myosin cytoskeleton , both of which were up - regulated in our study . Myosin and actin play a role in receptor - mediated endocytosis in the proximal renal tubule [ 10 ] . The importance of CHMP dysfunction in cystinuric patients is unclear . However , it may indicate an impairment of uptake of cystine crystals into vesicles preventing their degradation in lysosomes and facilitating their accumulation in the tubular cell with subsequent transfer to the intersti - tial space where they may initiate plaque formation . Indeed , Randall plaque was initially described in patients with CaOx stones [ 11 ] and later also demonstrated in cystinuric stone patients [ 12 ] . In a similar fashion , CaOx and CaP crystals have been shown to dissolve within lysosomes following binding and internalization of cultured renal cells [ 13 ] , but the involvement of CHMP was not described . Indeed , none of the endosomal proteins we found in CYS were part of the urinary proteomes of our patients with nephrolithiasis and hypercalciuria [ 14 ] , nor were described by others in patients with hyperoxaluria [ 15 ] , indicating their unique significance in CYS . Within transmembrane transport processes , we found sodium - amino acid and ammonium transporters to be down - regulated , while chloride channels were upregulated . We know that rBAT is a high - affinity protein that , as a com - ponent of the transport process at the apical membrane , facilitates sodium - independent uptake of cystine and dibasic amino acids [ 16 ] . Our study indicates that other sodium - dependent amino acid transporters may have an important role in cystinuria . The significance of chloride channel up - regulation is unclear but is likely related to defective endocy - tosis , since the endosomal chloride concentration regulates endocytic efficiency in proximal tubular cells . We found that a significant number of urinary proteins are involved in inflammatory responses , complement acti - vation and leukocyte mediated immunity in our cystinuric patients . These proteins were part of two clusters on the protein mapping and showed interaction with myosin - 2 , indicating dysregulation of the cell’s cytoskeleton . An increased number of up - regulated inflammatory proteins were also reported in a proteomic analysis of urinary exosomes obtained from 8 cystinuria patients compared to 10 controls [ 17 ] . Of those , 18 / 38 were circulating inflam - matory proteins ( e . g . , complement C3 and C8 ; fibrinogen alpha , beta , and gamma chain ; and serum paraoxonase 1 ) , and 14 / 38 were derived from neutrophils .

Altogether , these findings indicate that inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of kidney stone disease irrespective of its metabolic cause . The major limitation of this study is the small num - ber of samples that were analyzed . This is mainly due to the low incidence of cystinuria in the general population . However , this was intended as a pilot study to generate hypotheses and identify novel biomarkers and intracellular pathways that will require further investigation . Validation using highly specific methods such as ELISA and Western blotting is needed . Another study limitation is the lack of serum creatinine results in about 1 / 3 of the CYS patients and all HC . However , this should have not affected the results because our study was designed to include pooled urine samples and not individual ones , and to involve healthy individuals as controls . Lastly , most of the CYS patients were on medication that potentially could have affected the urine proteome profile . However , based on their mechanisms of action , it is unlikely that these drugs could change the protein composition of the urine . Thiol drugs bind only to cystine disulfide bridges to form more soluble cysteine - drug complexes without affecting other proteins in the urine . Moreover , there is no reason that citrate , which would change the urine pH in a relatively narrow range , would have affected the proteomic results . In conclusion , we provide proteomic evidence of impaired endocytosis , dysregulation of actin and myosin cytoskeleton , and inflammation in patients with cystinu - ria and kidney stone . Endosomal transport proteins were down - regulated mainly through defective CHMP . We can speculate that dysfunction of actin and myosin cytoskel - eton facilitates crystal adhesion and engulfment / endocy - tosis into renal tubular cell , while defective CHMP pre - vents crystal degradation in lysosomes . It is unclear how the impaired endocytic pathway and CHMP involvement contributes to the development of cystinuria stone disease . Answering these questions may facilitate further under - standing of the pathogenesis of the disease which may affect its management .
