ARTICLE OPEN E2F1 and epigenetic modi ﬁ ers orchestrate breast cancer progression by regulating oxygen - dependent ESRP1 expression Cheemala Ashok 1 , 4 , Neha Ahuja 1 , 4 , Subhashis Natua 1 , Jharna Mishra 2 , Atul Samaiya 3 and Sanjeev Shukla 1 ✉ © The Author ( s ) 2021 Epithelial splicing regulatory protein 1 ( ESRP1 ) is an RNA binding protein that governs the alternative splicing events related to epithelial phenotypes . ESRP1 contributes signi ﬁ cantly at different stages of cancer progression . ESRP1 expression is substantially elevated in carcinoma in situ compared to the normal epithelium , whereas it is drastically ablated in cancer cells within hypoxic niches , which promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) . Although a considerable body of research sought to understand the EMT - associated ESRP1 downregulation , the regulatory mechanisms underlying ESRP1 upregulation in primary tumors remained largely uncharted . This study seeks to unveil the regulatory mechanisms that spatiotemporally ﬁ ne - tune the ESRP1 expression during breast carcinogenesis . Our results reveal that an elevated expression of transcription factor E2F1 and increased CpG hydroxymethylation of the E2F1 binding motif conjointly induce ESRP1 expression in breast carcinoma . However , E2F1 fails to upregulate ESRP1 despite its abundance in oxygen - deprived breast cancer cells . Mechanistically , impelled by the hypoxia - driven reduction of tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 3 ( TET3 ) activity , CpG sites across the E2F1 binding motif lose the hydroxymethylation marks while gaining the de novo methyltransferase - elicited methylation marks . These two oxygen - sensitive epigenetic events work in concert to repel E2F1 from the ESRP1 promoter , thereby diminishing ESRP1 expression under hypoxia . Furthermore , E2F1 skews the cancer spliceome by upregulating splicing factor SRSF7 in hypoxic breast cancer cells . Our ﬁ ndings provide previously unreported mechanistic insights into the plastic nature of ESRP1 expression and insinuate important implications in therapeutics targeting breast cancer progression . Oncogenesis ( 2021 ) 10 : 58 ; https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41389 - 021 - 00347 - 6 INTRODUCTION Despite the enormous progress made in the realm of screening , diagnosis , and therapeutic strategies engaged in cancer manage - ment , breast cancer remains a major health concern and currently represents a top biomedical research priority . The complex process of breast cancer initiation and progression is associated with a dysregulation in many gene regulatory networks at the transcrip - tional , post - transcriptional , and epigenetic levels . Interestingly , RNA - binding proteins ( RBPs ) , which govern the post - transcriptional events , including alternative pre - mRNA splicing , polyadenylation , mRNA stability , mRNA localization , and translation , are emerging as critical regulators of several processes in breast carcinogenesis [ 1 – 3 ] . For instance , the RBPs SRSF3 , SRSF4 , SRSF6 , SRSF9 , and TRA2 β augment mammary cell proliferation and invasion by favoring the splice variants associated with various cancer hallmarks [ 4 – 6 ] . The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M ( hnRNPM ) promotes epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) and metastasis in breast cancer by promoting the biased expression of CD44 standard isoform ( CD44s ) [ 7 ] . Similarly , hnRNP A2 increases breast cancer cell invasion by promoting the expression of a speci ﬁ c isoform of TP53INP2 [ 8 ] . Also , RNA binding protein FOX2 ( also known as RBM9 ) drives mesenchymal - speci ﬁ c splicing to regulate EMT [ 9 , 10 ] . Remarkably , an increasing number of studies has unveiled a central role of Epithelial Splicing Regulatory Protein 1 ( ESRP1 ) in ﬁ ne - tuning RNA metabolism at different stages of cancer progression . For instance , in colorectal cancer , an elevated level of ESRP1 promotes cancer progression by actuating ﬁ broblast growth factor signaling [ 11 , 12 ] . ESRP1 is also upregulated in primary ovarian cancer than normal ovarian tissues and promotes cell proliferation and colonization , which is associated with poor patient outcome [ 13 , 14 ] . Similarly , the higher ESRP1 expression in prostate cancer poses an increased risk of disease progression with an unfavorable prognosis [ 15 ] . By analyzing TCGA databases , we also observed a similar overexpression of ESRP1 in breast carcinoma as against normal breast tissues . On the other hand , in a previous study , we have reported that ESRP1 expression is drastically ablated in the hypoxic regions of breast cancer tissues . Consequently , the ESRP1 regulated alternative splicing events go awry to generate aberrant protein isoforms that promote EMT and invasion [ 16 ] . Moreover , the association of reduced ESRP1 level with EMT acquisition and invasion is reported in multiple cancer types , including breast cancer [ 9 , 17 – 24 ] . Therefore , it is evident that cancer cells leverage the plastic nature of ESRP1 expression incongruously based on oxygen availability in the microenviron - ment , giving rise to phenotypic and functional heterogeneity .

In the present study , using both loss - and gain - of - function approaches , we reason that the elevated expression of ESRP1 during breast carcinogenesis and its pro - proliferative activity is effectuated by a concomitant upregulation in transcrip - tion factor E2F1 expression . We also demonstrate that ESRP1 is paradoxically downregulated in the hypoxic tumor milieu despite the abundance of E2F1 . This phenomenon is explained by our ﬁ nding that the decreased hydroxymethylation of CpG motifs at the E2F1 binding site abrogates the recruitment of E2F1 on the ESRP1 promoter under hypoxia . In concert with the reduced CpG hydroxymethylation , DNA hypermethylation at the E2F1 binding motif exacerbates ESRP1 diminishment under hypoxia . Further - more , the functional relevance of E2F1 upregulation in oxygen - deprived breast cancer cells is explicated by the ﬁ nding that E2F1 alters the cancer spliceome by upregulating splicing factor SRSF7 under hypoxia . Collectively , our study dissects previously unre - ported mechanistic insights into the expressional plasticity of ESRP1 during breast cancer progression and alludes to important therapeutic interventions . RESULTSTranscription factor E2F1 is essential for ESRP1 mediated breast carcinogenesis A series of recent studies have established an elevated ESRP1 level as a key determinant of tumorigenesis in several cancers , such as colorectal cancer , ovarian cancer , and head and neck cancer . However , ESRP1 ’ s expression pattern and modus operandi during breast carcinogenesis have remained elusive . To examine the mRNA and protein expression pattern of ESRP1 in breast cancer , we analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) and the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium ( CPTAC ) data using the UALCAN platform [ 25 , 26 ] . Both TCGA and CPTAC data analysis revealed that ESRP1 gene expression is signi ﬁ cantly higher in primary breast tumors than in normal breast tissues ( Fig . 1A and Supplementary Fig . S1A ) . Congruent with this observation , the immunoblot analyses exhibited a consistent upregulation of ESRP1 in breast tumors as compared to paired normal tissues ( n = 8 , P = 0 . 0002 ) ( Fig . 1B and Supplementary Fig . S1B , C ) . Furthermore , the Kaplan – Meier survival analysis using the TCGA breast invasive carcinoma database revealed that a higher expression of ESRP1 is associated with unfavorable patient outcomes ( Fig . 1C ) . These results prognosticate that ESRP1 is likely to act as an oncogenic driver of breast carcinogenesis . Therefore , it becomes compelling to unveil the regulatory mechanisms that underlie the increased ESRP1 level in the tumor tissues . To identify critical cis - acting elements involved in transcriptional control of ESRP1 expression , we performed promoter deletion analysis using a dual - luciferase reporter system . Reduced luciferase activities from promoter serial deletion fragments suggested vital regulatory elements at positions − 472 to − 325 bp of the transcription start site ( TSS ) ( Fig . 1D and Supplementary Fig . S2A ) . Furthermore , this region was scanned for potential transcriptional factor binding using JASPAR [ 27 ] , which predicted the highly conserved binding site of transcription factor E2F1 with the most decisive relative score ( 14 . 5898 ) ( Fig . 1E ) . To experimentally validate the requirement of E2F1 as a transcriptional activator for ESRP1 , we created luciferase reporter constructs of ESRP1 promoter segment − 472 / + 110 bp , wherein Fig . 1 ESRP1 is upregulated in primary breast tumors and is associated with a poor prognosis .

Ashok et al . 2 Oncogenesis ( 2021 ) 10 : 58 1234567890 ( ) ; , : the E2F1 binding site ( TCTCCCGCCCC ) is disrupted by site - directed mutagenesis ( Fig . 2A ) . When transfected to MCF7 and HCC1806 cells , the mutated construct exhibited substantially diminished luciferase activity compared to its wild - type counter - part ( Fig . 2B and Supplementary Fig . S2B ) . Furthermore , CRISPR - Cas9 mediated knockout of E2F1 resulted in a severe reduction in ESRP1 expression in both MCF7 and HCC1806 cells ( Fig . 2C – E ) . Moreover , the ChIP assay performed with the anti - E2F1 antibody revealed a remarkable enrichment of E2F1 at the ESRP1 promoter ( Fig . 2F ) . Next , to examine the effect of E2F1 overexpression on ESRP1 , we ectopically expressed E2F1 in cells harboring ESRP1 - 472 / + 110 bp luciferase reporter construct , which led to enhanced luciferase activity ( Fig . 2G and Supplementary Fig . S2C ) . Moreover , enforced C . Ashok et al . 3 Oncogenesis ( 2021 ) 10 : 58 E2F1 expression also increased the endogenous ESRP1 expression in breast cancer cell lines ( Fig . 2H – J ) . Furthermore , to investigate whether E2F1 follows a similar expression pattern in breast cancer as ESRP1 , we analyzed TCGA database and observed that E2F1 is signi ﬁ cantly upregulated in primary tumors compared to normal tissues ( Supplementary Fig . S2D ) . This observation is also validated experimentally by immunoblotting in breast cancer patient samples ( Fig . 2K ) . Consistent with these ﬁ ndings , correlation analysis of gene expression in TCGA and The Genotype - Tissue Expression ( GTEx ) data revealed a strong positive correlation between ESRP1 and E2F1 expression in breast cancer ( p < 0 . 01 , Pearson ’ s R = 0 . 54 ) ( Supplementary Fig . S2E ) . In addition , the Kaplan – Meier survival analysis using the TCGA database revealed that breast cancer patients expressing high levels of E2F1 exhibit a poor prognosis , which is in harmony with ESRP1 ( Supplementary Fig . S2F ) . This remarkable E2F1 - dependency of ESRP1 expression prompted us to investigate whether ESRP1 mediated breast tumorigenesis is also E2F1 - dependent . We performed MTT assay and clonogenic assay in MCF7 and HCC1806 cells after ectopically expressing Retinoblastoma ( Rb ) , which restricts E2F1 ’ s access to target promoters . E2F1 sequestration by Rb led to reduced cell viability and proliferation , while these phenotypes are reverted upon ESRP1 rescue in ESRP1 overexpressing cells ( Fig . 2L , M and Supplementary Fig . S2G – K ) . Collectively , these results demonstrate that ESRP1 mediated carcinogenesis is dependent on E2F1 - mediated transcriptional activation . E2F1 fails to bind the ESRP1 promoter in hypoxic breast cancer cells due to increased DNA methylation Like any other solid tumor , breast cancer develops regions of reduced tissue oxygen levels due to inadequate vascularization and poor blood circulation [ 28 ] . Cancer cells within hypoxic tumor regions often instigate EMT , invasion , and metastasis [ 29 ] . Interestingly , we have previously reported that ESRP1 expression is steeply declined by EMT - transcription factors under tumor hypoxia , which , in turn , skews the cellular spliceome to support EMT and invasion [ 16 ] . Therefore , we were keen to explore whether the ESRP1 downregulation is accompanied by a concomitant diminishment of E2F1 expression under hypoxia . Paradoxically , however , we observed that E2F1 was further induced under low - oxygen tension ( Fig . 3A – D ) . This discrepancy was explained by our ChIP assay results , which revealed that the E2F1 recruitment on the ESRP1 promoter is compromised under hypoxia ( Fig . 3E ) . Given that hypoxia plays a critical role in DNA hypermethylation [ 30 ] , we suspected that the reduced E2F1 recruitment on the ESRP1 promoter could be a consequence of the increased methylation of the E2F1 binding site . As expected , our MedIP results indicate that CpG islands around the E2F1 binding site on the ESRP1 promoter are heavily methylated under hypoxia as against normoxia ( Fig . 3F ) . In addition , breast cancer cells treated with 5 - aza - 2 ′ - deoxycytidine ( 5 - Aza - dc ) , an established DNA methylation inhibitor [ 31 ] , reduced the methylation level of the E2F1 binding site ( Fig . 3G ) , which , in turn , restored the E2F1 binding on the ESRP1 promoter ( Fig . 3H ) . Next , we sought to identify the DNA methyltransferases ( DNMTs ) responsible for hypoxia - driven hypermethylation of the E2F1 binding site . The shRNA - mediated knockdown of DNMT3A and 3B , but not DNMT1 , resulted in increased expression of ESRP1 under hypoxia ( Fig . 3I – K , and Supplementary Fig . S3A – E ) . Interestingly , despite a slight reduction in the DNMT3A / B expression under hypoxia ( Supplementary Fig . S3F , G ) , 5 - mC levels at the E2F1 binding site were signi ﬁ cantly elevated ( Fig . 3F ) . Therefore , these results suggest that de novo methyltrans - ferases are critical in restricting E2F1 from inducing ESRP1 expression in the hypoxic breast cancer cells . Decreased hydroxymethylation of the E2F1 binding site contributes to ESRP1 downregulation under hypoxia Like DNA methylation , DNA hydroxymethylation is also highly in ﬂ uenced by tumor hypoxia and plays an essential role in hypoxia - speci ﬁ c gene expression [ 30 ] . Therefore , we sought to understand any involvement of altered 5hmC dynamics in regulating E2F1 recruitment under hypoxia . The hydroxymethy - lated DNA immunoprecipitation ( hmedIP ) experiments performed with MCF7 cells revealed that the 5hmC levels are drastically reduced under hypoxia at the E2F1 binding site on the ESRP1 promoter ( Fig . 4A ) . The oxygen - dependent ten - eleven transloca - tion ( TET ) proteins are the key enzymes that catalyze DNA demethylation through 5 - methylcytosine oxidation . Hence , to understand the underlying mechanism of decreased 5hmC level , we explored the TET enzymes for their involvement in E2F1 - mediated ESRP1 expression . When a general TET inhibitor called Bobcat [ 32 ] was dosed onto HCC1806 and MCF7 cells , the ESRP1 expression was severely ablated ( Fig . 4B , C and Supplementary Fig . S4A , B ) as a result of decreased 5hmC ( Fig . 4D and Supplementary Fig . S4C ) , and a concomitant increase in 5mC level ( Supplementary Fig . S4D ) . Furthermore , we delved into screening all three TET enzymes ( TET1 , TET2 , and TET3 ) for their speci ﬁ city towards the E2F1 - ESRP1 axis . When all the TETs are knocked down individually in normoxic cells , only TET3 - knockdown resulted in decreased 5hmC and elevated 5mC level at the E2F1 binding site on the ESRP1 promoter ( Fig . 4E , F and Supplementary Fig . S4E , F ) . Congruently , only TET3 knockdown led to reduced ESRP1 expression ( Fig . 4G – I and Supplementary Fig . S4G – I ) , as a result of reduced E2F1 recruitment on the ESRP1 promoter ( Fig . 4J ) . Moreover , TET3 knocked - down cells under normoxia exhibited an identical alternative splicing pattern of ESRP1 targets ( hMENA , SLK , SCRIB , RALGPS2 , SLC37A2 , FNIP1 , CD44 , and ARHGEF1 ) as the hypoxic breast cancer cells ( Supplementary Fig . S4J ) , ( Supplementary Table S1 ) . However , it is worth noting that the hypoxia - induced changes in the TET3 expression are not consistent between MCF7 and HCC1806 cell ( Supplementary Fig . S4K , L ) . These data collectively portray that TET3 - mediated hydroxymethylation of CpG sites across the E2F1 binding motif is indispensable for E2F1 - mediated ESRP1 upregulation during Fig . 2 Transcription factor E2F1 is indispensable for ESRP1 - mediated breast carcinogenesis .

This is further seconded by our hMedIP assay results exhibiting a greater 5hmC level at E2F1 binding motif in breast tumor samples as against normal tissues ( Fig . 4K ) . E2F1 skews cancer spliceome by upregulating splicing factor SRSF7 in hypoxic breast cancer cells After dissecting the molecular basis of inef ﬁ cient E2F1 binding on the ESRP1 promoter under hypoxia , we sought to elucidate the signi ﬁ cance of elevated E2F1 expression in oxygen - deprived cells . We hypothesized that E2F1 might transcriptionally induce the RBPs other than ESRP1 to support hypoxic adjustments to the cancer spliceome [ 33 ] . To address this , ﬁ rst , we identi ﬁ ed the E2F1 - targeted RBPs after analyzing the published E2F1 ChIP - seq data ( GSM935477 ) . Next , we screened these RBPs for their differential expression under hypoxia versus normoxia by immunoblot analysis ( Supplementary Fig . S5A , B ) . Among all the RBPs ( HNRNPU , HNRNPK , RBM5 , HNRNPLL , HNRNPH1 , HNRNPM , HNRNPA2B1 ) screened , only SRSF7 ( also known as 9G8 ) was substantially upregulated in hypoxia - treated breast cancer cells ( Fig . 5A , B ) . To experimentally validate the E2F1 - dependence of SRSF7 expression , we performed CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated knockout of E2F1 , which resulted in a severe reduction of SRSF7 ( Fig . 5C – E ) . Furthermore , our ChIP assay results con ﬁ rmed the binding of E2F1 on the SRSF7 promoter ( Fig . 5F ) . Next , we investigated the role of E2F1 in orchestrating the alternative splicing of SRSF7 - targeted pre - mRNAs such as Fas [ 34 ] and Tau [ 35 , 36 ] under hypoxia . E2F1 knockout resulted in the reversal of the hypoxia - speci ﬁ c alternative splicing scheme by increasing the inclusion of Fas exon 6 and Tau exon 10 , both of which would otherwise be excluded by SRSF7 in hypoxic cells ( Fig . 5G ) . Notably , the biased expression of shorter Fas isoform ( Fas Δ Ex6 ) under the in ﬂ uence of the hypoxia - driven E2F1 - SRSF7 axis renders the hypoxic cancer Fig . 3 Hypermethylated binding motif repels E2F1 from the ESRP1 promoter in hypoxic breast cancer increased DNA methylation .

Ashok et al . 5 Oncogenesis ( 2021 ) 10 : 58 cells uniquely suited for bypassing programmed cell death . Our in vivo data also con ﬁ rms increased expression of SRSF7 in hypoxic tumor regions ( Supplementary Fig . S5C ) . Therefore , it is evident from these results that E2F1 plays an important role in skewing the cancer spliceome to meet the altered adaptive requirement in the hypoxic tumor niches . DISCUSSION The aberrant expression of RBPs in many human cancers with diverse underlying mechanisms contributes to accelerated tumor progression by regulating RNA metabolism at several levels , including alternative splicing , thus emphasizing the need for ﬁ nely - tuned expression of RBPs in the cell . ESRP1 , a member of the RBM family of RBPs , was initially identi ﬁ ed as epithelium - speci ﬁ c splicing regulators in a genome - wide high - throughput cDNA screen aimed at ﬁ nding the key regulators of FGFR2 splicing in epithelial cells [ 22 ] . ESRP1 mediate the alternative splicing of a number of genes associated with actin dynamics , cell polarity , and cell - cell adhesion during EMT [ 37 ] . Recently , a panoply of research has established the elevated ESRP1 level as a signi ﬁ cant determinant of tumorigenesis in several cancers , such as color - ectal cancer , ovarian cancer , and head and neck cancer . In line with these observations , our present work also found that ESRP1 is weakly expressed in normal breast epithelium , whereas its expression level in carcinoma in situ was substantially elevated . Interestingly , in a previous report , we have demonstrated that ESRP1 expression is shackled in the hypoxic regions of breast tumor , and consequently , hypoxic epithelial cells attain mesench - ymal phenotype due to a dramatic re - organization of actin Fig . 4 Reduced CpG hydroxymethylation at the E2F1 binding motif contributes to ESRP1 downregulation under hypoxia .

Ashok et al . 6 Oncogenesis ( 2021 ) 10 : 58 dynamics . In addition , a large body of research has reported the diminishment of ESRP1 level during EMT acquisition and invasion as a result of upregulation in EMT - associated transcription factors , such as δ EF1 , SIP1 , Snail , Slug , and Twist [ 21 , 22 , 38 , 39 ] . Thus , the expression pattern of ESRP1 at different stages of cancer progression is phenomenally plastic , and this plasticity seems to play a critical role in the spatiotemporal optimization of cancer spliceome . However , despite substantial efforts to under - stand the regulatory mechanism of ESRP1 downregulation during EMT , the factors involved in the up - regulation of ESRP1 during tumorigenesis remained to be fully elucidated . In our quest to unveil the trans - acting regulators of ESRP1 upregulation , we analyzed the ESRP1 promoter , and our results demonstrate that the binding of transcription factor E2F1 is essential for ESRP1 expression . Notably , similar to ESRP1 , E2F1 also gets upregulated in the primary breast tumor as opposed to normal breast tissues . However , the mechanism of E2F1 upregulation under hypoxia still remains to be determined . Next , we asked whether a decrease in E2F1 level is observed upon hypoxia treatment following the expression pattern of ESRP1 . Unexpectedly , E2F1 expression was further enhanced in hypoxic cells than in normoxic cells . To reason this discrepancy , we investigated the possible alteration in binding ef ﬁ ciency of E2F1 and found that the E2F1 recruitment on the ESRP1 promoter is compromised under hypoxia despite its abundant expression . This phenomenon is further explained by our ﬁ nding that the E2F1 binding is sensitive to DNA methylation and hydroxymethy - lation . More speci ﬁ cally , oxygen deprivation coerces the E2F1 binding site to lose hydroxymethyl marks owing to diminished TET3 activity , which follows a concomitant gaining of DNMT3A / 3B - mediated methyl marks . Furthermore , hypoxia - induced changes in TET3 levels are inconsistent among different cell lines while maintaining a consistently low 5hmC level at the E2F1 motif on ESRP1 promoter under hypoxia . These results commensurate with a previous report that demonstrated that reduction in oxygen availability lowers the 5hmC level due to impaired TET activity , independently of TET expression [ 30 ] . Of note , the expression of DNMT3A / 3B is only modestly affected under hypoxia , while the increase in 5mC levels at the E2F1 motif is signi ﬁ cant . These observations strengthen our hypothesis that the loss of hydro - xymethyl marks readily favors the recruitment of de novo methyltransferases , irrespective of their expression levels . Alto - gether , our study revealed how the epigenetic marks ﬁ ne - tune the recruitment of E2F1 on ESRP1 promoter , and it is highly likely that the methylation / hydroxymethylation status of the E2F1 motif on the ESRP1 promoter demonstrates a distinct pattern , irrespective of the expressional changes of epigenetic modi ﬁ ers under hypoxia at a global level . In addition , the knockdown of TET3 essentially mimicked tumor hypoxia to effectuate the pro - EMT splicing switch of ESRP1 targets . We further explored the possible role of E2F1 in in ﬂ uencing the transcription of splicing factors other than ESRP1 under hypoxia . It turned out that the elevated E2F1 level under hypoxia is actually essential for the expression of splicing factor SRSF7 , which in turn contributes to the spliceomic adaptation in response to tumor hypoxia . Collectively , our ﬁ ndings unveil the regulatory mechanisms underlying the plastic nature of ESRP1 expression during breast carcinogenesis ( Fig . 6 ) and insinuate novel therapeutic interventions .

Bioinformatics analyses The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) gene expression pro ﬁ le of ESRP1 and E2F1 , and Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium ( CPTAC ) data for ESRP1 pertaining to normal breast tissue and primary breast tumor were obtained from the university of Alabama cancer ( UALCAN ) platform ( http : / / ualcan . path . uab . edu ) [ 25 , 26 ] . Prognostic values of ESRP1 ( Affymetrix ID 225846 _ at ) and E2F1 ( Affymetrix ID 204947 _ at ) in breast cancer are analyzed by web platform Kaplan – Meier Plotter ( www . kmplot . com ) . The cohorts are divided into high - and low - expression groups according to upper and lower quartile gene expression and then two groups are compared in terms of relapse free survival [ 40 ] . The pairwise correlation analysis between mRNA expression of E2F1 and ESRP1 was performed on GEPIA web tool using TCGA BRCA and GTex database [ 41 ] . RNA interference The MCF7 and HCC1806 cells ( 2 × 10 5 ) were seeded and after 24 h cells were infected with lentivirus containing small hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) ( Sigma , Mission Human Genome shRNA Library ) against Tet1 , Tet2 , Tet3 , DNMT1 , DNMT3a , DNMT3b , and shControl with 8 µg / ml polybrene ( Sigma , H9268 ) containing media . Cells were selected using 1 µg / ml puromycin ( Sigma , P9620 ) for 3 days . For rescue experiments , overexpression of Rb1 and ESRP1 was done using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent ( Invitrogen , 11668019 ) as per the manufacturer ’ s instructions . The list of shRNAs used in this study is given in Supplementary Table S2 . Generation of gene speci ﬁ c cDNA clones , promoter deletion constructs and site - directed Mutagenesis ESRP1 - pCMV - 3Tag - 1A clone was generated by PCR - ampli ﬁ ed full - length ESRP1 fragment using cDNA derived from MCF7 cells as a template . This PCR - ampli ﬁ ed full - length ESRP1 fragment was cloned into pCMV - 3Tag1a ( Agilent , 240195 ) vector between BamHI F and HindIII R restriction sites . E2F1 and RB1 expression plasmids were a kind gift by Dr . Sudhakar Baluchamy , Department of Biotechnology , Pondicherry University , INDIA . The details of the primers are listed in Supplementary Table S3 . To generate promoter constructs , human ESRP1 ( Gene ID : 54845 ) promoter sequence was retrieved from the Eukaryotic Promoter Database ( EPD ) ( https : / / epd . vital - it . ch / ) . Different lengths of ESRP1 promoter constructs were PCR ampli ﬁ ed from genomic DNA derived from MCF7 cells and inserted / ligated into pGL3 basic vector ( Promega ) between KpnI and NheI restriction sites . The primers used in promoter constructs are listed in Supplementary Table S4 . The site - directed mutant construct of the ESRP1 promoter was prepared using oligonucleotides harboring mutations in the E2F1 binding site . The wild type ESRP1 − 472 promoters was used as a template . The ESRP1 promoter SDM was con ﬁ rmed by DNA sequencing after the digestion of non mutated vector with the endonuclease DpnI ( TaKaRa , 1235 A ) . The details of the oligonucleotides are listed in Supplementary Table S5 . Luciferase reporter assays The luciferase reporter assays were performed as described previously [ 42 ] . Brie ﬂ y , MCF7 and HCC1806 cells ( 0 . 05 ×10 6 ) were seeded in 24 - well plates and cultured for 16 h . The cells were co - transfected with different ESRP1 promoter – luciferase constructs along with pRL - TK Renilla luciferase plasmid ( Promega , E2231 ) . After 48 h transfection , cells were harvested and lysed and then subjected to detection of luciferase activity using the GloMax - Multi Detection System ( Promega ) , and the values were normal - ized to Renilla luciferase activities . The relative values are represented as mean ±SD of triplicates from a representative experiment . Cell viability assay The in vitro cell viability test was performed with a MTT assay as described previously [ 43 , 44 ] . 24 h post transfection , cells were seeded in 96 - well culture plates ( 4 × 10 3 / well ) for 12 h , 24 h , 36 h , 48 h , and 60 h ( in triplicate for each condition ) . 20 µl MTT ( Sigma , Saint Louis , USA ) stock solution ( 5 mg / ml ) was added to each well and incubated for 2 – 3 h . Then , the supernatant was removed , followed by the solubilisation of MTT crystals using DMSO and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm using plate reader BioTek Eon ( BioTek , Winooski , USA ) . Colony formation assay Colony formation assay was performed using standard protocol [ 45 , 46 ] . 24 h post transfection , cells were seeded in 6 - well culture plates at low density ( ~ 1000 cells per well ) and cultured for 7 days . The cells were ﬁ xed using methanol and acetic acid ( 3 : 1 ) for 5 min at RT followed by staining with 0 . 1 % crystal violet in 10 % ethanol . Results were shown as the mean value ± SD error using GraphPad Prism . The assay was repeated three times . Chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assay Chromatin immunoprecipitation reaction was performed using standard protocol [ 47 ] . Brie ﬂ y , the nuclei were isolated from MCF7 and HCC1806 cells , followed by sonication of the lysates to shear the DNA ( approximate average size was 200 – 500 bp ) , DNA - protein complexes in the lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti - E2F1 ( Abcam , ab179445 , lot Fig . 6 The expression of ESRP1 is substantially elevated in breast carcinoma - in - situ compared to normal breast tissue . The elevated levels of transcriptional activator E2F1 and gain of 5hmC marks on the ESRP1 promoter govern the ESRP1 upregulation . However , ESRP1 expression is severely diminished within the hypoxic tumor niche despite a high E2F1 level . Mechanistically , hypoxia - driven reduction in TET3 activity coerces the E2F1 binding site on the ESRP1 promoter to lose 5hmC marks while gaining DNMT3A / 3B - dependent 5mC marks . Additionally , elevated E2F1 regulates the hypoxia - speci ﬁ c spliceome by inducing SRSF7 expression . C . Ashok et al . 8 Oncogenesis ( 2021 ) 10 : 58 no .
