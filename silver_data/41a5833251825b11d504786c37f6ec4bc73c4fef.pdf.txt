Shirley Christine Mills iii Abstract Communication within and between cells is called signalling ; elucidation of cell signalling in diseases , especially metastatic cancers , creates opportunities for developing therapeutic interventions . Signalling initiation occurs when a cell surface receptor binds a ligand ; the signal then transmits via phosphorylation events through cytosolic signalling proteins to nuclear or effector proteins that orchestrate a cellular response . G - protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) are one type of receptor ; a sub - family of GPCRs are chemokine receptors , their ligands , chemokines , can trigger directional migration . Homeostatic chemokine - triggered migration can be hijacked by cancer cells to facilitate metastasis . This study explored various poorly understood aspects of chemokine signalling that may support metastasis with the aim of identifying therapeutic targets . Methodology employed THP - 1 , Jurkat and MCF7 cell - lines , the manipulation of signalling by antagonists , siRNA knockdown or plasmid modification , followed by calcium and chemotaxis assays , protein visualisation using immunofluorescence , flow cytometry and western blot . Investigations found that in THP - 1 cofilin phosphorylation temporally relates to CXCL12 - stimulation and to chemotactic migration . In THP - 1 , but not Jurkat , JAK2 and STAT3 signalling support chemotaxis to CXCL12 and CCL2 . Various NSAIDs , Aspirin and Paracetamol drug - specifically influenced chemokine - induced migration and cofilin activity . Rac1 , FAK / Pyk2 and Pi3K were found important for chemotaxis to CXC - but not CC - chemokines and to modulate cofilin phosphorylation . Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 was found to compete with CXCR4 ligands . Many signalling proteins involved in cancer , including GRKs , Src , Raf , MEK , ERK , Cdc42 , ROCK , β - catenin and p38MAPK were shown to positively influence chemotactic migration , also Arrestin - 2 to support chemotaxis to CXCL12 , and Arrestin - 3 chemotaxis to CCL3 . Dynamin inhibitors and siRNA knockdown produced chemokine , cell type , and dynamin domain - specific responses , Dynamin’s G - domain being important for CXCL12 - and PH domain for CCL3 - induced migration . PKC’s role in malignancies was found contradictory and isoform specific ; PKCε and PKCδ supporting chemotaxis to CXCL12 but not CCL3 , whereas PKCα and PKCζ influenced migration to both CXCL12 and CCL3 . This thesis offers novel insights into the complexities of chemokine - induced migration . It examines many key signalling proteins implicated in cancer ; reports that NSC23766 offers promise as a lead compound for developing CXCR4 biased antagonists ; and offers possible mechanisms , through cofilin phosphorylation and effects on cell migration , for the mixed epidemiology reported for different NSAID’s with respect to their influences on cancer incidence and progression , and suggests Ibuprofen may offer anti - metastatic efficacy . iv Table of Contents Abstract . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Cell Signal 2018 42 : 88 - 96 1 Chapter 1 : Introduction Most of us have heard of cancer , many will understand that early detection can offer cure , this is because survival rate is dramatically dashed by metastasis , the movement of a cancer cell from its primary site to a secondary niche which supports its growth and division . Cancers are diverse ; they comprise normal cells with acquired genetic instability and abnormalities that render them refractory to normal controlling influences on their growth , lifespan and location [ 1 , 2 ] . Metastasis can occur in response to ‘come hither’ signals from amongst others chemokines , small proteins secreted by immune and other cells [ 3 ] . The signalling networks driving metastasis are only partially understood , some component proteins and pathways have been identified but the full network and its spatiotemporal dynamics represents a major objective in oncology research . Cancer touches most people’s lives at some point , either their own or someone dear to them ; developing new therapies requires us to listen in and try to understand the conversations within and between our cells , contributing to our understanding of this signalling dialogue was the aim of my research . This chapter aims to acquaint the reader with the basics and some of the intricacies of chemokines , chemokine receptors and immune cells ; and introduce key signalling proteins relevant to the research work reported in later chapters . 1 . 1 : Cells Eukaryotic cells are the basic structural and functional unit of the human body . Within each cell are many components each of which perform unique functions , figure 1 . There are many different types of cells in humans together making up the different tissues ; muscular , nervous , epithelial or connective . Some cells are dynamic and motile , cell movement often involves crawling over the extracellular matrix . This enables fibroblasts to move into wounds to support healing , and neutrophils and macrophages to respond to tissue invasion by pathogens . However with cancer cell movement facilitates metastasis [ 4 ] . 2 Figure 1 . 1 : Cancer cells may contain many of the components of normal cells but often display reduced cytoplasm , an abnormal shape , plus multiple or enlarged dark staining nucleus with an irregular nuclear border , a nucleus containing clumpy chromatin and multiple nucleoli . Cancer cells are normal cells that have acquired some or all of the following characteristics : Immortality so they are able to undergo repeated replication and resist apoptosis ; DNA mutations and genome instability ; an ability to induce angiogenesis , promote inflammation , avoid destruction by immune cells , and evade growth suppressors , also they may produce sustained proliferative signalling . Cancer cells also lose their ability to differentiate and have dysregulated cellular energetics [ 5 ] . For example a cell may become cancerous due to dysregulation of amino acid and glucose metabolism in response to abnormal growth factor signalling . Activation of a signalling pathway known as Pi3K / Akt may be key to this initial creation and support of a cancer cell because such signalling can trigger the reprogramming of mitochondrial metabolism [ 2 ] . Healthy cells compete for growth factors that govern their uptake of nutrients and maximise their ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria . However when growth factors are present in excess cells can increase their nutrient uptake and start using anabolic glycolysis , the energy production method commonly found in cancer cells . Nutrient supply appears key to cancer initiation [ 6 ] . Transcription factors are proteins that regulate the function of genes , oncogenes are genes that in some circumstances make a cell cancerous . Myc is an oncogene that can support this cancer initiation by promoting mitochondrial production of glutamine , a good carbon source and nitrogen donor , aiding macromolecule production and thus cell proliferation . Hence cancer can initiate from oncogene - directed metabolic reprogramming allowing anabolic growth , and cell proliferation [ 1 ] .

Cells talk to each other using small peptides or ions which , like words , can pass on an instruction or message and produce a physiological response . This talking is called cell signalling . Cell signalling can occur within cells ( autocrine signalling ) , between neighbouring cells over short distances ( paracrine signalling ) , or between cells or a collection of cells ( a tissue ) over longer distances ( endocrine signalling ) . Intracellular communication between areas of the cell itself occurs via signalling pathways composed of membrane or cytosolic proteins . Passing the message ( stimulus ) between these proteins frequently involves protein phosphorylation which may activate or inactivate the next protein / s in the pathway . A cell’s architecture is fundamental to its morphology and its mobility ; signalling can modify a cell’s morphology causing temporally and spatially transient changes in protein complexes within the many intracellular domains . The signalling cascade can initiate cellular responses e . g . activation of transcription factors , or cell movement [ 7 , 8 ] . Immune cells employ a communication process facilitated by small protein signalling molecules that are secreted from one cell and detected by another cell or cells . Cells detect these signalling molecules , also called ligands , using receptors which are usually transmembrane proteins located within their plasma membrane . There are many different receptors , and each ligand will have affinity for and bind one or more receptors . Each receptor may bind one or more ligand . After binding the ligand / receptor pair can activate one or more intracellular signalling ‘pathways’ within the cell , usually producing an end response . Responses can include stimulating the cell to move up a chemical gradient which is termed cell migration [ 9 , 10 ] . 1 . 3 : Cancer and metastasis Cancer is where abnormal cells undergo uncontrolled division , often invading nearby normal tissues . Metastasis is the spread of these cells to a distant secondary site in the body . In cancer communication within and between cells goes wrong . Stem cells exist in a ‘niche’ ; changes in their microenvironment or various transcription factors and signalling can activate them to make progenitor cells which then differentiate to generate tissues as required . When this goes wrong uncontrolled growth can initiate a benign tumour which may over time become cancerous . Cancer may also initiate through somatic mutation triggered by environmental stimulus , such as UV light or carcinogenic chemicals , or may arise from congenital insults , genetic defects , inflammation , ageing , and / or infection by virus or parasite [ 3 , 11 ] . 4 Cancer is not one disease ; cancers are individual , complex and usually heterogeneous , so for example only some of the cells within a tumour will be capable of endless self - renewal i . e . malignant . Tumours are complex microenvironments composed of cohabiting malignant , healthy and immune cells . No two people’s cancers are the same , as their oncogenic , genetic , epigenetic and immunological phenotypes will differ [ 11 ] . 1 . 3 . 1 : Cell signalling in metastasis Cell - cell communication in cancers encompasses many feedback loops that can activate or inhibit cell growth [ 3 , 11 ] . The prevention of cancer progression , the migration of malignant cells from the localised primary tumour to secondary locations , requires a better understanding of cell signalling within malignant cells and between tumours and healthy tissues , as it is this communication that facilitates cell migration . Elucidating signalling pathways supporting metastasis is challenging , but considerable progress has been made , for example the dysregulation of calcium homeostasis has long been recognised as a casualty of cancer [ 12 ] , with intracellular calcium dynamics modulating organelle functions , oncogenesis and ultimately cell death [ 13 , 14 ] . Much is known about the role of cell energetics , glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration as mediators in cancer progression [ 2 ] , and that mutations of receptors , key initiators of many signalling pathways , can also contribute to malignancy [ 15 ] . However to develop new therapies we need a better understanding of cell signalling . Immunotherapies , such as the checkpoint inhibitors , Programmed Death Protein - 1 ( PD - 1 ) and Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte associated Antigen - 4 ( CLTA - 4 ) , are amongst the most innovative of the new treatments available for cancer . They are monoclonal antibodies that by binding inhibitory surface receptors on the cancer cells re - target cytotoxic T - cells to destroy cancer cells [ 16 ] . 1 . 4 : G - Protein Coupled Receptors The surfaces of most cells bristle with a multitude of different receptors which enable the cell to communicate with its environment . Contributing to this array is the family of G - Protein Coupled Receptors ( GPCRs ) , of which there are over 800 distinctly different members [ 17 ] . GPCRs mediate responses to many different stimuli ( agonists ) which may arrive in the form of light , peptides , proteins , or sugars . Examples include hormones , neurotransmitters and immune system messaging proteins called cytokines . GPCRs are membrane proteins consisting of a peptide chain with a conserved basic tertiary structure that consists of seven hydrophobic transmembrane regions . When an agonist binds the GPCR , it undergoes a conformational change favouring its coupling with three intracellular heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide - binding proteins ( G - proteins ) , Gα , Gβ and Gγ . Guanine exchange factors ( GEFs ) then promote GDP exchange for GTP on the Gα 5 subunit ; this allows Gα - GTP and Gβγ to dissociate and interact with various effector proteins . The extracellular stimulus is translated into tightly regulated , highly specific , intracellular signalling cascades [ 18 , 19 ] . GPCRs can be regulated by receptors becoming refractory to stimulus ( desensitisation ) , receptor internalisation by endocytosis , and by longer term down - regulation of receptors . The desensitisation can be through the action of kinases ; protein kinase A ( PKA ) , protein kinase C ( PKC ) , and G - protein receptor kinases ( GRKs ) which may trigger binding of β - arrestins , halt G - protein activation and trigger desensitisation of GPCR [ 20 , 21 ] . 1 . 5 : Chemokines Cytokines are small secreted proteins that influence cell behaviour through modulation of cell signalling . Chemokines are a large subfamily of chemotactic cytokines [ 22 ] . Cell signalling allows cells to sense and respond to their environment and maintain homeostasis . Aberrant signalling between and within cells can initiate and perpetuate cancers [ 23 ] . Chemotactic chemokines can play a role in homeostasis . These small 8 - 12 kDa basic proteins regulate cell migration when they interact with and activate a specialist type of GPCR termed a Chemokine Receptor . Spatial and temporal expression of chemokines regulate the trafficking and locations of many cell types including leukocytes [ 24 , 25 ] . There are four sub - families of chemokines classified by the arrangement of the initial two cysteines ( C ) with respect to non - cysteine residues ( X ) within each chemokine amino acid sequence . The largest two of these four families are the CXC chemokines , where one amino acid separates the first two cysteines at the N - terminal of the peptide chain , and the CC chemokines , where cysteines are adjacent . The other two families , known as XC and CXXXC , have very few members [ 26 ] . Although there is promiscuity in interactions between chemokines and their cognate GPCR , many restrict their ligand - binding to favoured partners [ 24 , 25 ] . Leukocytes can express many different chemokine receptors . This differential expression allows the recruitment of specific cell types to specific tissues or locations providing a tailored appropriate immune response to the infective or inflammatory insult [ 26 ] . 1 . 6 : Chemokine receptors Chemokine receptors are subdivided into CC , CXC , XC and CXXXC with respect to their favoured ligands [ 25 ] . There are at least 18 G αi - coupling chemokine receptors and 5 non - chemotactic Atypical Chemokine Receptors ( ACKRs ) . ACKRs may undertake roles such as recycling or scavenging chemokines to maintain chemotactic gradients . Interestingly some chemokines have dual roles , as they can also act as classical receptor antagonists , antagonising ligand - receptor 6 interactions and responses . For example CXCL11 acts as a CCR5 antagonist and so hinders the binding of CCR5 ligand CCL3 [ 27 , 28 ] . Some chemokine receptors are also the target of non - chemokine ligands e . g . macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( MIF ) is a cytokine that binds CXCR4 [ 29 ] as does extracellular ubiquitin [ 30 ] and nuclear protein HMGB1 [ 31 ] . On chemokine receptor activation the signal passes to GPCR - associated G - proteins , subunits α , β and γ . The GDP on the Gα subunit is phosphorylated to GTP , Gα dissociates from Gβγ and , depending on stimulus , subunits trigger particular intracellular signalling proteins and pathways . There are at least four Gα subtypes Gα s , G αi / o , Gα q / 11 , Gα 12 / 13 . Chemokine chemotaxis purportedly mainly follows G αi or G α12 / 13 signalling and can involve Rho family GTPases , RhoA , Rac1 and Cdc42 [ 18 , 32 , 33 ] . Signalling cascades can be triggered through both Gα and Gβγ and involve phospholipase C ( PLC ) isoforms . Diacylglycerol ( DAG ) and inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( IP 3 ) produced in response to PLC signalling can trigger many converging or diverging signalling pathways within the cell ; for example PLCβ signalling via phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( Pi3K ) to phosphatase Slingshot ( SSH ) , which can activate a small protein called cofilin which remodels the key cytoskeletal protein actin enabling leukocyte polarization and cell chemotaxis [ 34 ] . 1 . 7 : Inflammatory and homeostatic chemokines Chemokines can also be classified into functional groups such as ‘inflammatory chemokines’ , including CXCL9 , CXCL10 , CXCL11 , which can act to produce increased inflammation . Inflammatory CC chemokines include CCL3 ( MIP - 1α ) and CCL2 ( MCP - 1 ) , figure 1 . 2 . ‘Homeostatic chemokines’ is another classification . Many CC chemokines are coded on chromosome 17q12 and CXC chemokines on 4q13 . 3 . However homeostatic chemokines are coded at other loci , for example CXCL12 , on 10q11 . 21 . [ 35 ] . CXCL12 is usually constitutively expressed in lymphoid tissues and can mediate homeostatic chemotaxis of lymphocytes and other cells . However CXCL12 can be upregulated and become inflammatory in disease including in cancers . Dysregulated chemokine or chemokine receptor expression can trigger or worsen prognosis in diseases including those involving inflammation or malignancy [ 3 , 36 ] . A B Figure 1 . 2 : Examples of ( A ) CC and ( B ) CXC chemokine receptors and their ligands . CCR1 CCR4 CCR5 CCR2 CCL3 CCL2 CXCR4 CXCR7 CXCR3 CXCL12 CXCL11 CXCL9 CXCL10 7 1 . 8 : Receptors CXCR4 , CXCR7 ( aka ACKR3 ) and their ligand CXCL12 CXCL12 is typical amongst homeostatic chemokines in binding only two chemokine receptors , each with non - redundant specific roles . CXCL12 binds CXCR4 and CXCR7 , CXCL11 binds CXCR3 but also binds CXCR7 which is an ACKR . Atypical receptors are still seven transmembrane proteins but do not signal like classical chemokine receptors . They can lack the DRYLAIV motif in their second intracellular loop which aids coupling to G αi G - proteins [ 37 , 38 ] . CXCR7 is well conserved across species [ 39 ] . It is known to dimerize with CXCR4 and may moderate the effects of CXCL12 binding CXCR4 . CXCR7 may produce atypical signalling , not via G - proteins [ 40 ] , and can act as a CXCL12 sink [ 41 ] . Interestingly although CXCR7 is not highly expressed in healthy tissues in an adult it is frequently present in malignant cells and through MAPK signalling can promote neo - angiogenesis [ 40 ] . CXCR4 - CXCL12 signalling is key in keeping hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow [ 42 ] . Unfortunately this ability of CXCR4 - CXCL12 signalling to support homing of stem cells can be hijacked by tumour cells , as CXCL12 can aid metastasis and the formation of secondary tumours [ 43 ] . 1 . 9 : ELR - positive and - negative CXC chemokines CXC chemokines can further be classified on the absence or presence of the glutamic acid - leucine - arginine ( ELR ) sequence occurring just prior to the CXC sequence . ELR - positive CXC chemokines mainly promote angiogenesis ( examples include CXCL1 , CXCL5 and CXCL8 ) whereas ELR - negative CXCs mainly inhibit angiogenesis [ 44 ] . CXCL9 ( aka MIG ) , CXCL10 ( aka IP - 10 ) and CXCL11 ( aka ITAC ) are all ELR - negative and inhibit angiogenesis . They also attract anti - tumour T - lymphocytes and so may cause tumour regression [ 45 - 47 ] . CXCL9 , CXCL10 and CXCL11 all bind CXCR3 which has three splice variants CXCR3 - A , CXCR3 - B and CXCR3 - alt . CXCR3 - A supports proliferation and chemotaxis , whereas CXCR3 - B inhibits migration , proliferation and can trigger apoptosis [ 48 , 49 ] . 1 . 10 : Chemokines and T - lymphocytes ( T - cells ) Chemotaxis is when a cell senses a chemokine and moves or ‘taxis’ towards it up the chemokine concentration gradient . In homeostasis this draws leukocytes towards damaged or infected cells releasing chemokines [ 50 ] . Chemokines can recruit effector T - cells including CD8 + T - cells ( cytotoxic T - cells ) and T - helper CD4 + cells type 1 and 2 ( T H 1 and T H 2 ) . Both types are T - helper cells supporting and regulating adaptive immune system function . T H 1 and T H 2 differ in the cytokines and type of immune responses they produce . Chemokines can also recruit Natural Killer ( NK ) cells which can engage with and cause apoptosis in malignant cells . T H 1 and NK cells express CXCR3 , the receptor for ligands CXCL9 and CXCL10 ; these chemokines draw T H 1 and NK cells into the 8 tumour microenvironment , figure 1 . 3 . The presence of T H 1 and NK cells can improve patient prognosis and reduce metastasis [ 51 , 52 ] , and their presence in tumours improves outcomes as they increase CD8 + T - cell secretion of interferon - γ and reduce metabolism of the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin by tumour - associated fibroblasts [ 53 ] . Figure 1 . 3 : Immune cells can be recruited into the tumour microenvironment by chemokines ; T - reg and Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells ( pDC ) are recruited by CXCL12 and CD8 + T - cells , and T - helper cells and NK cells by CXCL9 and CXCL10 . Monocytes differentiate into M1 and M2 macrophages . M1 macrophages stimulate the immune system , are microbiocidal and cause tumour cytotoxicity , whereas M2 macrophages support tumour growth by promoting matrix remodelling and angiogenesis [ 43 , 54 - 56 ] . Human T - helper - 17 cell ( T H 17 ) function in human tumours is somewhat controversial [ 57 ] but they do express CXCR4 [ 58 ] which may aid their recruitment and retention in inflamed and malignant tissues where there are high levels of CXCL12 . T H 17 can recruit CD8 + T - cells , dendritic , and NK cells [ 59 - 62 ] into the tumour micro - environment ; this is clinically helpful [ 63 ] . Tumour metastasis frequently occurs in the bone marrow , an immunosuppressive microenvironment that can aid malignant cell survival and growth . Regulatory T - cells ( T - regs ) aka suppressor T - cells maintain self - tolerance , preventing autoimmune disease , but also suppress immune responses to malignant cells [ 64 ] . T - regs can be recruited into the bone marrow and tumour microenvironments by CXCL12 as they express CXCR4 . Increasing T - reg bone marrow load promotes an immune suppressive environment favouring implantation and growth of bone metastasis [ 65 , 66 ] . NK cells express chemokine receptors including CXCR3 , CCR2 and CCR5 [ 67 ] ; CCR2 aids the movement of NK cells into tumours [ 68 ] . NK cells can activate CD8 + and other T - cells to attack and kill tumour cells . NK cells are part of the non - specific innate immune system . They have a single invariant antigen receptor which recognises a specific glycolipid antigen enabling them to activate Treg Cell Dendritic Cell ( pDC ) NK Cell CD8 + T cell T Helper1 Cell Monocyte M1 Macrophage M2 Macrophage IL - 10 TGFβ CXCR4 CXCR3 CXCR3 CXCR3 CXCR4 CXCR3 CCR5 Mature Mature into into Recruited by CXCL12 Recruited by CXCL19 , CXCL10 and CXCL11 Promotes stemness , proliferation , survival , invasion and metastasis Inhibits angiogenesis Tumour inhibition Immune supression Tumour promotion M1 macrophages produce CXCL9 , CXCL10 and CXCL11 , toxic intermediates and cytokines that kill malignant cells , and promote inflammatory responses to the tumour CCR2 CCR5 CXCR4 Immune stimulation , Tumour inhibition M2 macrophages reduce inflammatory responses and T H 1 immunity , and promote tissue remodelling and angiogenesis bacterial lipopolysaccharides and interferon - gamma Interleukins IL - 4 , IL - 10 and IL - 13 , corticosteroids , and prostaglandins 9 CD8 + T - cells to target and kill MHC - positive tumour cells , whereas the NK cells themselves can kill MHC - negative tumour cells [ 55 ] . 1 . 11 : Chemokines and B - lymphocytes ( B - cells ) B - lymphocytes mature in the bone marrow and can develop into memory B - cells or plasma cells producing antibodies . Both form part of humoral immunity and the Adaptive Immune System . B - cells can act as Antigen Presenting Cells ( APCs ) and secrete cytokines [ 69 ] , including some chemokines , and may also express CXCR4 . Hence they may be recruited by CXCL12 into tumour microenvironments where they may improve prognosis [ 70 , 71 ] . In lymphatic tissues associated with tumours B - cells may express chemokines which helpfully increase T - cell responses . B - cells can also serve as APCs in the tumour microenvironment and may positively or negatively influence anti - tumour immunity [ 72 ] . CXCL12 can recruit Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells ( pDC ) , which are part of the innate immune system . pDCs produce interferons and some chemokines including CXCL10 and CCL3 which attract immune cells to sites of infection or inflammation , and they also present antigens to CD4 + T - helper cells . pDCs also express chemokine receptors including CXCR3 , CXCR4 , CCR2 and CCR5 . pDCs need to express CCR2 and CCR5 to egress from the bone marrow whereas CXCR4 expression allows their retention in the bone marrow stroma where their development occurs , but also allows their attraction into CXCL12 - producing tumour environments where they can impair T - cell destruction of malignant cells and so hinder prognosis [ 56 , 73 ] . pDCs also produce pro - inflammatory cytokines and trigger immune tolerance favouring cancer progression [ 74 ] . 1 . 12 : Tumour - associated macrophages , CCL2 and CCL3 Macrophages are large phagocytic leukocytes that develop from monocytes produced by stem cells in the bone marrow . Macrophages express CCR2 and so can respond to CCL2 and be attracted into tumours [ 75 ] . High numbers of Tumour Associated Macrophages ( TAM ) correlate with poor prognosis [ 76 ] as they can inhibit helpful T - cell activation [ 77 ] , increase resistance to chemotherapy [ 78 ] and support metastasis [ 76 ] . This is because TAMs secrete CCL2 , which can induce CCL3 secretion from metastasis - associated macrophages at metastatic sites ; this can aid growth of secondary tumours [ 79 ] . However in some circumstances macrophages may aid survival . They can assist tumour - associated antigen T - cell ‘cross - priming’ by phagocytosing dead malignant cells then cross - presenting cancer antigens to cytotoxic T - cells , promoting the T - cells to attack live malignant cells [ 80 ] . Depending on the treatment employed macrophages may support or antagonise cancer therapy [ 81 ] . This is because TAMs can be influenced by their environment 10 to differentiate into an inflammatory ( M1 ) or pro - tumour ( M2 ) state . Bacterial lipopolysaccharides and interferon - γ induce macrophage polarization into M1 - subtypes that can kill cancer cells . However when entering tumours macrophages encounter cytokines such as interleukin - 10 that can polarise them into M2 - subtypes which can support tumour growth [ 54 ] . CCL2 is frequently produced by malignant tumours and the level of production correlates with macrophage infiltration . Excess CCL2 production can lead to TAM accumulation and tumour destruction , whereas modest accumulations can cause inflammation and tumour initiation . TAMs themselves may also produce CCL2 [ 82 - 84 ] . CCL2 and CCL3 can support tissue invasion as they stimulate the secretion of Matrix Metalloproteases ( MMP ) , including MMP9 , by monocytes . Matrix metalloproteases are molecular scissors , as they aid intracellular matrix penetration by migrating cells [ 85 ] . Circulating monocytes are precursors of macrophages [ 77 ] . CCL2 released from a tumour can recruit monocytes expressing CCR2 [ 86 ] from the blood . Treatment with the anti - CCL2 antibody , Carlumab , prevents this and reduces metastasis e . g . from breast to lung . However once Carlumab is withdrawn metastasis is accelerated . This could be due to a feedback mechanism accelerating tissue production of CCL2 [ 87 ] , or that blocking CCL2 accumulates monocytes in the bone marrow which are released upon Carlumab withdrawal , allowing mass monocyte infiltration into metastatic tumours [ 88 ] , which also increases local vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and CXCL8 ( interleukin - 8 ) levels . CCL2 and CCL3 also support metastasis and angiogenesis , as the formation of new blood vessels allows tumours to grow [ 89 ] . However , even if TAM accumulation could be effectively prevented neutrophil accumulation may take its place , and have equally detrimental pro - tumour and pro - metastatic effects [ 85 , 90 ] . Additionally CCL2 stimulates JAK2 and p38 mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signalling supporting metastasis [ 91 ] . CCL2 can also promote proliferation via activation of Rho GTPases [ 92 ] , Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition ( EMT ) [ 93 ] , and the survival and motility of cancer cells [ 92 ] . EMT is the process where epithelial cells lose their polarity , cell - cell adhesiveness , become migratory and invasive by gaining mesenchymal multipotent and stem - cell like properties . EMT is essential for embryogenesis but the process in later life facilitates metastasis of tumours [ 94 ] . CCL2 and CCL3 signalling can recruit macrophages into malignant tissues . These chemokines target CCR1 , CCR2 and CCR5 . Blocking this recruitment may inhibit accumulation of immunosuppressive leukocytes in the tumour microenvironment , stall metastasis and tumour neoangiogenesis [ 75 , 79 ] ; indeed , reducing macrophage load may increase anti - PD - L1 immunotherapy success [ 82 ] . However blocking chemokine production alone appears ineffective 11 [ 87 ] , but may work synergistically with developing therapies such as cancer vaccines . For example CCL2 inhibition in mouse models potentiates cancer vaccines in lung cancer [ 95 ] . Recently clinical trials were conducted with a CCR2 antagonist CCX872 - b [ 96 ] , however treatment did not have a control so the benefits of adding CCX872 - b to standard 5 - fluorouracil , leucovorin , irinotecan , oxaliplatin regimens are not easily analysed . An anti - CCR2 monoclonal antibody Plozalizumab ( MLN1202 ) , which stops CCL2 binding CCR2 , that reached phase - 2 trials for bone metastasis has been withdrawn , although in trials for arthrosclerosis Plozalizumab did appear to reduce C - reactive protein levels , a marker for inflammation [ 97 ] . 1 . 13 : Tumorigenic signalling complexities , CXCL9 , CXCL10 , CXCL11 and CXCL12 . CXCL9 , CXCL10 and CXCL11 chemotaxis and signalling through CXCR3 can be key in orchestrating anti - tumour immune responses such T H 1 T - cell polarisation , the recruitment of cytotoxic T - cells , NK cells and IFNγ production [ 98 ] . However these chemokines can also support metastasis and cell proliferation [ 99 ] . This converse situation illustrates the difficulty of designing effective immunotherapies . Immune cell chemotaxis is dependent on chemokine gradient and chemokine receptor expression but also on other modulators present in vivo for example CXCL9 , CXCL10 and CXCL11 expression by monocytes and malignant cells is upregulated by cytokines such as TNFγ , and Tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNFα ) [ 100 , 101 ] . Additionally there are the CXCR3 - A and CXCR3 - B receptor subtypes whose responses differ [ 49 ] as well as factors such as CXCL9 , CXCL10 and CXCL11 acting as antagonists to CCR3 which itself stimulates T H 2 polarization [ 102 ] . CXCL12 can work synergistically with VEGF to produce angiogenesis to support tumours [ 60 ] . CXCL12 supports malignant cell survival and proliferation [ 103 ] , plus CXCL12 - CXCR4 signalling promotes metastasis , invasion of cancer cells [ 104 ] and possibly radiation resistance [ 105 ] . When CXCL12 binds CXCR7 , the receptor may act as a scavenger [ 106 ] but CXCL12 - CXCR7 may also signal in malignant and associated endothelial cells via non - G - protein pathways e . g . CXCR7 is reportedly able to signal via ERK1 / 2 and p38 MAPK - kinase , G αi - independently in Jurkat [ 107 ] , and via JAK2 / STAT3 upregulating β - and N - cadherin [ 108 ] . β - catenin is involved in transcription , and along with N - cadherin , in cell - cell adhesion and migration . β - catenin expression and signalling can be upregulated in cancers and is reported to suppress chemokine expression and so the attraction and activation of effector T - cells . β - catenin signalling is tumorigenic , as it supports EMT and changes in cancer cells to a stem - cell - like phenotype [ 109 ] . Conversely CXCR7 signalling in astrocytes is reported to involve pertussis toxin sensitive G αi / o G - proteins , and stimulate ERK1 / 2 and Akt via β - arrestin - 2 triggered internalisation [ 110 , 111 ] . 12 CXCL12 - CXCR7 signalling may support angiogenesis by increasing VEGF levels [ 112 ] . Inhibiting CXCR7 can inhibit T - cell chemotaxis [ 106 ] . CXCR7 expressed in malignant cells may increase survival , growth , adhesion and invasion of breast [ 113 ] , prostate [ 114 ] , and lung cancer cells [ 115 ] although CXCR7 expression may also aid lung repair after insult [ 116 ] . MCF7 breast cancer cells have been shown to express CXCR4 , and at lower levels CXCR7 . Knocking out CXCR7 with small interfering RNAs ( siRNA ) modestly reduced proliferation in MCF7 , but no further inhibition of proliferation was observed if both CXCR4 and CXCR7 were depleted with siRNAs , suggesting proliferation in this cell - line involves CXCR4 - CXCR7 dimerization . Interestingly MCF7 were found to strongly express both CXCL12 and CXCL11 [ 117 ] . The generally observed upregulation of CXCR7 in cancer cells compared to healthy cells may be a disease response aimed at repair . 1 . 14 : Oncogenic and epigenetic influences on chemokines DNA methylation of genes can modulate the expression of chemokines such as CXCL9 and CXCL10 in malignant cells , and so influence the trafficking of cytotoxic and NK cells into cancerous tissues that may be critically important for the success of some immunotherapies such as PD - L1 inhibitors [ 118 ] . These are immune checkpoint inhibitors ; they facilitate the immune system attacking the cancer cells but leaving healthy tissue alone . PD - 1 is a checkpoint protein on T - cells ; cancer cells can carry PD - L1 , a protein which when it binds PD - 1 stops the T - cells attacking and destroying them . Monoclonal antibodies that bind either PD - 1 or PD - L1 block the interaction and the T - cells remain able to attack and destroy the cancer cells . Examples of PD - L1 monoclonal antibodies include Pembrolizumab and Nivolumab [ 119 ] . Drugs aiming to reprogram epigenetic signatures may restore chemokine expression and so also T - cell movement into tumours [ 118 ] . CXCR4 in malignant cells carrying a point mutation , making the receptor functionally active , showed increased signalling and chemotaxis to CXCL12 , but conversely the mutation slowed tumour growth . Inhibition of this mutated CXCR4 with AMD3100 , a small molecule CXCR4 antagonist , reversed this slowdown but only in vitro not in vivo [ 120 ] ; chemokine gradients may have contributed to this outcome . Other genetic mutations can also increase CXCR4 expression , for example , in rhabdomyosarcoma fusion of PAX3 and FKHR genes occurs , which increases the cancer cells’ invasiveness [ 121 ] . Hypoxia is a common feature in central zones of solid tumours , and it can stimulate CXCL12 [ 122 ] and CCL2 expression [ 123 ] . Transcription factors such as Hypoxia - Inducible Factor 1 ( HIF1 ) mediate malignant cell responses to hypoxia [ 124 ] . HIF1 may bind the promoter region of CXCL12 gene - inducing translation of CXCL12 mRNA . Hypoxia can also stimulate both malignant cells and TAMs to express CXCR4 [ 125 , 126 ] and inhibit expression of 13 CXCR7 [ 127 ] . Blocking CXCL12 - CXCR4 signalling may be therapeutic in cancers as the signalling supports cell proliferation , invasiveness , angiogenesis and metastasis [ 128 , 129 ] . 1 . 15 : Chemokine receptor CXCR4 and metastasis CXCL12 / CXCR4 aberrant signalling is heavily implicated in cancer , tumour angiogenesis and the survival and metastasis of malignant cells [ 130 , 131 ] . The expression of CXCR4 is reportedly upregulated in many malignancies [ 132 ] . However CXCR4 can also be essential to maintain health . For example in B - cells CXCR4 expression facilitates immune responses to infection and autoimmune diseases [ 133 ] . Somatic homeostasis may also involve immune modulation by the sympathetic nervous system , for example adrenaline stimulation of B 2 - aderenergic receptors may , through interaction with CCR7 and CXCR4 receptors , cause retention of lymphocytes in lymph nodes , resulting in reduced peripheral tissue concentrations of antigen - carrying T - cells in inflammatory diseases [ 134 ] . CXCR4 is therefore an attractive target for therapeutic manipulation . Blocking CXCR4 / CXCL12 signalling with small molecule inhibitors has been shown to inhibit metastasis [ 135 ] . A simplification of the complex signalling through the CXCL12 / CXCR4 axis in metastasis is illustrated in figure 1 . 4 . Figure 1 . 4 : CXCR4 / CXCL12 signalling supports tumour cell spread from primary to secondary locations [ 136 - 140 ] .

It is known that the cell context , along with both CXCR4 oligmerization and CXCL12 oligmerization , adds levels of control [ 141 , 142 ] . CXCR4 is a class A GPCR [ 143 ] . Dimerization of CXCR4 has been shown by investigations of crystal structures with small antagonists , fluorescence resonance energy transfer , bioluminescence and other techniques to be key in functional selectivity , and in the gain of function of mutated CXCR4 in cancers and WHIM syndrome where there are heterozygous mutations of CXCR4 [ 144 ] . Recent research and crystal structures suggests that CXCR4 may interact with CXCL12 in 1 : 1 , 2 : 2 or 2 : 1 CXCR4 : CXCL12 ratios [ 145 , 146 ] . GPCRs have seven transmembrane helices which in CXCR4 are arranged in a goblet shape in such a way that two sub - pockets capable of accommodating ligands are available . These are known as the major pocket formed by helices 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 , and the minor pocket formed by helices 1 , 2 , 3 and 7 [ 147 ] . The G - protein binding site lies in the centre of the helices on the cytosolic side , figure 1 . 5 . Figure 1 . 5 : Basic goblet structure of the CXCR4 receptor . Major pocket - red star , minor pocket - blue star , G - protein binding site - green star , transmembrane domains ( TM ) - black , extracellular loop 2 ( ECL2 ) - purple , ECL3 - green . Residues thought essential for CXCL12 binding - red , and for CXCL12 activation - blue [ 147 - 153 ] . Chemokine receptor activation may follow the chemokine binding to the N - terminal , major and minor pockets , triggering receptor conformation change and activation precipitating the binding of a G - protein to the intracellular site . Research on CXCR4 suggest the major and minor pockets are connected [ 147 ] . These pockets have been analysed using ligand structure activity and mutagenesis studies which allow their mapping . It has been found some CXCR4 ligands such as AMD3100 and AMD11070 , figure 1 . 6 , bind the major and minor pockets and their interface [ 147 , 149 ] . NH 2 COOH T M 6 Asp187 Glu288 Asp97 Glu268 Glu179Asn180Asp181Asp182Asp187Tyr190 15 ( A ) AMD3100 ( B ) AMD11070 Figure 1 . 6 : Structures of CXCR4 inhibitors AMD3100 and AMD11070 Chemokine receptors , including CXCR4 , differ from other class A GPCRs in the position of their helix bundle , extracellular , and ligand binding domains . Various standard sequences found in other GPCRs in specific locations , and the generic numbering system developed for GPCRs ( which relies on conserved motifs and sequences e . g . DRY in transmembrane helix 3 ( TM3 ) does not translate completely to chemokine GPCRs [ 145 , 154 , 155 ] . CXCL12 itself may function differently when in monomeric or dimeric form . CXCL12 acts as a partial agonist incapable of inducing chemotaxis when dimeric , but still able to induce intracellular calcium flux [ 156 - 158 ] . Several residues are thought essential for CXCL12 binding , namely Asp97 in TM2 , Asp187 in extracellular loop 2 ( ECL2 ) and Glu288 in TM7 . Others , such as Glu179 to Asp182 , Asp187 and Tyr190 in ECL2 , and Glu268 in ECL3 and Glu288 are thought important for CXCR4 signalling [ 150 - 153 ] . Research has employed NMR as well as site - directed mutagenesis studies . NMR studies show the first eight residues of CXCL12 N - terminus contain two amino acids that are essential for CXCR4 activation , namely Lys1 and Pro2 which may interact with CXCR4’s Asp187 ( ECL2 ) and Glu288 ( TM7 ) . Investigations so far have led to the theory that CXCL12 interacts with CXCR4 in a two - step process . Firstly the CXCL12 motif between amino acids 12 and 17 , ‘RFFESH’ ( Arg - Phe - Phe - Glu - Ser - His ) , binds CXCR4’s N - terminus followed by CXCL12’s N - terminus between amino acids 1 and 8 . This locates into a transmembrane helix of CXCR4 triggering conformation change and activation [ 146 , 150 - 153 , 158 - 162 ] . Put together the extensive research completed supports the importance of the purported minor and major sub - pockets located in CXCR4’s transmembrane cavities for CXCL12 binding . With the minor pocket formed by helices one , two , three , and seven [ 147 ] , where ECL2’s residues Glu179 , Asp187 , Tyr190 and Asp193 , plus ECL3’s Glu268 along with Trp94 and Asp97 ( both in TM2 ) are key . The major pocket is surrounded by helices three , four , five , six and seven , with Asp171 ( TM4 ) , Tyr255 and Asp262 ( both in TM6 ) being important . Also considered to contribute are Tyr116 ( TM3 ) and Glu288 ( TM7 ) which sit at the edge of the major and minor sub - pockets . The CXCL12 N - terminal Lys1 and Pro2 are thought to sit in CXCR4’s minor sub - pocket in contact with Asp97 ( TM2 ) , Asp187 ( ECL2 ) and Glu288 ( TM7 ) , three key activation residues , figure 1 . 7 . What has also been explored is how one CXCL12 protomer could successfully bind a CXCR4 dimer . It is suggested that CXCL12’s Lys1 and Pro2 could continue to occupy one CXCR4’s minor 16 sub - pocket and still be in contact with activators Asp97 ( TM2 ) , Asp187 ( ECL2 ) plus Glu288 ( TM7 ) in a CXCR4 dimer . CXCL12 may remain longer in contact with a CXCR4 homodimer than a CXCR4 monomer , and also be in contact for longer when CXCL12 : CXCR4 stoichiometry is 1 : 2 than would occur with 1 : 1 [ 147 , 148 ] . Figure 1 . 7 : CXCR4 sequence with key binding residues for CXCL12 in red , TM = transmembrane region , ICL = intracellular loop , ECL = extracellular loop . Having briefly explored the role of chemokines , chemokine receptors and the immune system in metastatic signalling , next key individual proteins will be introduced that are involved in transferring the message from an activated chemokine receptor onwards into a cell . 1 . 16 : Introduction to Dynamin and Dynamin Like Proteins ( DLPs ) For a receptor to internalise an endocytic vesicle needs to form from the cell membrane . This requires the recruitment of several cytosolic proteins including the GTPase dynamin . Dynamin is purported to aid the scission of vesicles from the membrane by forming helical oligomers around the necks of budding vesicles , before GTP hydrolysis creates conformational change in the dynamin polymer producing vesicle / membrane fission . However this is not dynamin’s only role in cellular function [ 163 , 164 ] . Dynamins are also involved in cytokinesis , organelle division , pathogen resistance and transport vesicle budding [ 165 ] . There are three dynamin mammalian genes producing at least twenty - five distinct splice forms of dynamin : eight variants of dynamin - 1 , mainly found in neurons ; four variants of dynamin - 2 which is ubiquitous ; and thirteen variants of dynamin - 3 mainly found in brain and testis [ 166 ] , N - terminus MEGISIYTSDNYTEEMGSGDYDSMKEPCFREENANFNKIFLPTIYSIIFL - 50 TGIVGNGLVILVMGYQKKLRSMTDKYRLHLSVADLLFVITLPFWAVDAVA - 100 NWYFGNFLCKAVHVIYTVNLYSSVLILAFISLDRYLAIVHATNSQRPRKL - 150 LAEKVVYVGVWIPALLLTIPDFIFANVSEADDRYICDRFYPNDLWVVVFQ - 200 FQHIMVGLILPGIVILSCYCIIISKLSHSKGHQKRKALKTTVILILAFFA - 250 CWLPYYIGISIDSFILLEIIKQGCEFENTVHKWISITEALAFFHCCLNPI - 300 LYAFLGAKFKTSAQHALTSVSRGSSLKILSKGKRGGHSSVSTESESSSFHSS - 352 C - terminus TM1 TM1 TM2 ICL1 ECL1 TM3 ICL2 TM4 ECL2 TM5 ICL3 ECL3 TM7 TM6 17 suggesting varying specialist roles for dynamin throughout the body . Different isoforms can uniquely interact with specific proteins , for example dynamin - 1 is found in presynaptic neuronal tissue and is involved with axon growth , whereas dynamin - 3 is found in dendritic spines where it purportedly mediates remodelling [ 167 , 168 ] . The main differences in dynamin - 1 , - 2 and - 3 are in the last 150 residues in the C - terminus proline - rich domain . Dynamin isoforms interact with various proteins and lipids with varying affinities and oligomerizational ability producing tissue - specific regulation [ 169 ] . Dynamin - 1 , - 2 , and - 3 are members of the DLPs membrane remodelling GTPase family . Other DLP members include Dynamin - related protein - 1 ( Drp - 1 ) and mitofusin ( Mfn ) both found in mitochondrial outer membranes . Drp - 1 is involved in mitochondrial fission , whereas Mfn mediates mitochondrial fusion along with a DLP called Optic Atropy - 1 ( OPA - 1 ) found in mitochondrial inner membrane [ 170 ] , figure 1 . 8 . Figure 1 . 8 : Dynamics of dynamin and dynamin - like proteins ( DLPs ) in a migrating cell [ 163 , 170 , 171 ] . 1 . 16 . 1 : Dynamin family proteins structure and domains The dynamin monomers reside in the cytosol . Dynamin structural regions from the N - terminal consist of a G - domain , a stalk region , a Pleckstrin Homology ( PH ) domain , a GTPase Effector Domain ( GED ) , and at the C - terminal a Proline - Rich Domain ( PRD ) , figures 3 . 3 and 3 . 4 . Phospholipids binding dynamin’s PH domain can stimulate its activity , and dynamin’s GTPase activity can be stimulated by oligomerization of the protein via interactions of GTPase domains , PhagocytosisFluid filled endosome Phagocytosis Membrane retrieval Rac Dynamin interacts with FAK to mediate adhesion Dynamin aids severing of secretory vesicle at Golgi Dynamin accumulates at leading edge with Rac & actin Dynamin at caveolae Dynamin interacts with actin at membrane ruffles Drp - 1 FAK Dynamin Mitochondria division OPA1 - dynamin - like GTPase Mitofusin Mitochondrial fusion Dynamin aids formation of clathrin coated pits Dynamin Clathrin Caveolin OPA1 Mitofusin Drp - 1 F - actin nucleus Dynamin aids severing of clathrin coated vesicles 18 the middle domains , and the GEDs . Stimulation also follows binding of SH3 - domain proteins to dynamin’s PRD [ 165 ] . Crystallographic studies show dynamin can form hairpin - like dimers , with the PH and GTPase domains sitting either side of a pocket , and juxtaposed BSE ( stalks ) interacting in a criss - cross arrangement . The PRDs do not appear in the crystal structure as they project out of the polymerized helix , figures 1 . 9 and 1 . 10 . Figure 1 . 9 : Regions of the crystal structure of a dynamin dimer [ 172 , 173 ] . BSE – Bundle Signalling element or ‘neck’ . PH – Pleckstrin Homology , aids lipid membrane binding . GED – GTPase Effector Domain , aids ring assembly . PRD – Proline - Rich Domain , aids interaction with SH3 domain proteins MLS – Mitochondrial leader sequence PTD – Predicted Transmembrane Domain Figure 1 . 10 : Structural elements of Dynamin and Dynamin - Like Proteins ( DLPs ) [ 163 , 165 ] . 1 . 16 . 2 : Dynamin polymerization Dynamin monomers form dimers , the basic unit , through interactions of the stalk regions , [ 174 ] then dimers themselves interact , forming oligomers . Different oligomeric rings of dynamin can link through the G - domains [ 175 ] . The PH domains , “the feet” , bind lipid membranes positioning the PRD region facing the cytosol , so ideally placed to interact with other proteins . The PH domain has affinity for acidic membrane phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ) aka PIP 2 [ 176 ] . Curvature of the membrane itself may attract dynamin [ 177 ] . Antagonising the PH domain is known to impair clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 178 ] . There are also hydrophobic ( lipid binding ) loops protruding from the PH domain , figure 3 . 2 , which may promote curvature of the oligomer and membrane interactions [ 179 ] . The PRD domain strongly supports dynamin’s interaction and co - ordination with SH3 - motifs in other proteins , helps to draw dynamin to endocytic locations , and co - ordinate endocytosis [ 180 ] .

The oligomer must circle the membrane tube and connects with itself via the G - domains , as GTPase activity depends on G - domain dimerization . G - domain dimer GTP hydrolysis then produces a lever - like movement of dynamin’s BSE domains which propagates along the dynamin subunits , thus narrowing the dynamin helix diameter constricting the membrane tube [ 183 ] , figure 1 . 11 . Figure 1 . 11 : Mechanism of dynamin - mediated vesicle and membrane fission [ 163 , 183 ] . Fission is thought not to occur solely due to shearing or tearing as tube radius decrease occurs too slowly [ 184 ] . Helix disassembly may trigger membrane destabilisation and fission [ 185 ] , although this is still debated [ 184 ] . Other DLPs share some of dynamin’s structural features and mode of action [ 186 , 187 ] . Membrane severing can in vitro be achieved by dynamin alone , in vivo this may also involve other proteins and processes , such as actin polymerization or myosin providing membrane tension thus supporting membrane fission [ 188 ] . Dynamins catalyse scission but also may modulate clathrin - coated pit maturation . Over expressing dynamin - 1 mutants , with GTPase domains inactivated , was found to accelerate clathrin - mediated endocytosis ; how is not clear [ 189 ] . Dynamin - 1 can alone curve membranes and catalyse fission . Dynamin - 2 cannot shape membranes alone , it appears to need other curve - generating proteins to produce fission [ 190 ] . Dynamin - 1 and dynamin - 2 mRNA are equally present in non - neuronal tissues , however dynamin - 1 may be phosphorylated and so inactivated by GSK3β which itself is constitutively active [ 191 ] . Inhibiting GSK3β can activate both dynamin - 1 and clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 192 ] . 1 . 16 . 4 : Endocytosis plays a key role in regulation of intracellular signalling Endocytosis involves the inward budding of vesicles from the plasma membrane . Endocytosis allows the passage of components between cellular compartments but also mediates cellular signalling [ 193 ] . Vesicle cargo can include GPCRs with bound ligands . Endocytosis of the receptor can terminate signalling [ 194 ] or initiate signalling cascades from endosome complexes . GTP GTPase Stalk Foot PH domain Plasma membrane Multiple cycles of spontaneous GTP - GDP exchanges Clathrincoated vesicle Polymerization of dynamin helix Membrane fission Dynamin dimers depolymerize 20 Endosomes can be classified as early , recycling or late endosomes . The pathway followed by endocytic vesicles and their intracellular fate can qualitatively and quantitatively control downstream signalling and hence cellular responses [ 193 , 195 ] . This signalling can reciprocally also regulate both further receptor endocytosis , and the endocytic pathways followed by subsequent endocytic vesicles [ 196 , 197 ] . This crosstalk can mediate cancer prognosis by modulating migratory , proliferative and survival signals supporting metastasis [ 198 ] . 1 . 16 . 5 : Influences of cargo on endosome fate Signalling from endosomes has been shown to influence post - uptake sorting decisions , between recycling to the membrane and degradation pathways [ 199 ] . Coated pits reportedly may themselves trigger signalling pathways e . g . through JAK2 and Akt [ 200 ] , and even surviving flat clathrin lattices may act as signalling platforms [ 201 ] , as do caveolar micro - domains which can support catabolic oxidative mitochondrial metabolism and cell signalling effects favouring malignancy [ 202 ] . Endosomes may contain signalling platforms that trigger Grb2 - mSOS - Ras signalling [ 203 ] and determine signal strength and specificity [ 204 ] . For example endosomes containing APPL1 scaffolding protein can signal from Akt to GSK3β , whereas Akt signalling from the plasma membrane can follow the mTOR pathway [ 205 ] . 1 . 16 . 6 : Dynamin , β - arrestins and the Rho GTPases When GPCRs signal through trimeric G - proteins the stimulated G - protein is inactivated by GPCR kinases , β - arrestin recruitment may follow [ 206 ] . β - arrestins can also act as adaptors linking G - proteins to clathrin - coated pits and clathrin - mediated endocytosis . However , MAPK pathway signalling may continue from early endosomes via β - arrestins acting as scaffolds , or from GPCR / arrestin complexes [ 207 , 208 ] . This secondary signalling may vary in specificity and strength from the original issuing from the GPCR / ligand at the plasma membrane [ 209 ] , and be controlled by GPCR type . GPCRs may use PDZ - domain / s to interact with the actin cytoskeletal components and delay clathrin coated pit maturation and dynamin recruitment and / or receptor ubiquitination [ 197 , 210 ] . This appears relevant for CXCR4 [ 211 ] , and for CCR5 signalling as both receptors contain a C - terminus PDZ - binding sequence [ 212 ] . Endocytosis can be modulated by Ras and Rho GTPases . Rho GTPases support actin - dependent clathrin - independent endocytosis [ 209 ] , but Rac and Rho activation may actin - independently inhibit clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 213 ] . 1 . 16 . 7 : Dynamin’s role in Clathrin - dependent endocytosis Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is one of several endocytic pathways [ 214 ] . It requires Adaptor Protein Complex - 2 ( AP2 ) to recruit clathrin proteins to the plasma membrane [ 215 ] . Supported by other endocytic assessor proteins a clathrin - coated pit develops around its cargo until it has formed a narrow neck connecting it to the plasma membrane . This neck triggers recruitment and 21 assembly of dynamin which triggers scission [ 216 ] . The endocytic vesicle may then fuse with others containing similar or different cargoes . These are early phosphatidylinositol - 3 - phosphate ( PI3P ) rich endosomes , which carry interacting scaffold proteins such as EEA1 or APPL1 that mediate endosome maturation and sort endosomes into three possible pathways [ 217 ] . Receptor cargoes can be ( i ) rapidly recycled back to the plasma membrane , ( ii ) slowly recycled to the membrane via perinuclear recycling endosomes or ( iii ) retained , ubiquitinated and degraded when endosomes fuse with lysosomes , this terminates signalling and down - regulates receptors [ 171 ] . Clathrin - dependent endocytosis is important in signalling from many receptors . It appears involved in the building of multi - protein clathrin - containing pits which enable surface receptors and their ligand to be internalised [ 218 ] . Dynamin may help modulate cell signalling by regulating receptor endocytosis , so clearance of receptors from the cell surface , and the formation of signal transduction complexes in endosomes [ 195 , 219 ] . 1 . 16 . 8 : Dynamin’s role in clathrin - independent endocytosis The endocytic protein endophilin - A recruits dynamin [ 220 ] and may play a subsidiary role in clathrin - mediated endocytosis , as may cofilin , a small protein controlling actin polymerization [ 188 ] . Endophilin - A also controls a clathrin - independent endocytic pathway , it carries an SH3 - domain that strongly binds proline - rich motifs in some GPCRs , and is involved in some receptor - ligand stimulated endocytosis . Endophilin - A , but not clathrin , is found at the leading edge in some cells undergoing chemotaxis , whereas in non - migrating cells endophilin - A and clathrin - coated pits are equally present . Endophilin - A , F - actin and dynamin are all in plentiful supply at the leading edge of cells , and all participate in rapid β - arrestin - independent formation of clathrin - independent endophilin - A assemblies which facilitate receptor endocytosis , following GPCR stimulation [ 221 ] . Endophilin - A may interact with dynamin to produce the pulling - force needed for scission [ 222 ] . Such endophilin - A - rich endocytic vesicles then can be tracked from the membrane to perinuclear area . Growth factors can also facilitate this rapid endophilin - A - mediated endocytosis , or hinder it if absent . Fast endophilin - A - mediated endocytosis appears important in chemotaxis , and may also play a role in Raf , MEK , ERK ( MAPK ) and growth factor signalling , which produces chemotaxis . Although not affected by clathrin - knockdown or inhibition , endophilin - A - mediated endocytosis is hampered by dynamin knockdown or mutation ( K44A dominant negative mutant ) , or dynamin inhibition using Dyngo4a , Dynasore , MitMAB and OctMAB . Endophilin - A - mediated budding and endocytosis is also inhibited by the inhibition of actin polymerization , Pi3K , Rho or Rac , whereas inhibiting Cdc42 increased endophilin - A - rich 22 vesicle formation . Overall endophilin - A - mediated endocytosis appears dependent on dynamin , actin , cholesterol , Rac , Rho , Pi3K and PAK1 [ 221 ] . Receptor - ligand binding may stimulate Pi3K to produce phosphatidylinositol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) - triphosphate ( aka PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and PIP 3 ) from PtdIns ( 4 , 5 , ) P 2 ( aka PIP 2 ) . PIP 3 is plentiful at a cell’s leading edge . Once produced PIP 3 is hydrolysed back to PIP 2 by phosphatase PTEN [ 223 ] . PTEN inhibition increases leading edge endophilin - A levels , this is Pi3K - dependent . SHIP1 and SHIP2 hydrolyse PIP 3 to PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 [ 224 ] , this reduces leading edge endophilin - A levels . A PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 - binding protein lamellipodin binds endophilin - A at the leading edge , triggering fast endophilin - A - mediated endocytosis [ 225 ] , figure 1 . 12 . Figure 1 . 12 : Dynamin contributes to both clathrin - dependent and endophilin - mediated endocytosis . Endophilin controls a leading edge fast - acting clathrin - independent pathway dependent on dynamin , Rac and actin that facilitated endocytosis of some GPCRs . SHIP1 dephosphorylates P ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 forming P ( 3 , 4 ) P2 , SHIP2 recruits lamellipodin which summons endophilin [ 221 , 223 , 225 ] . 1 . 16 . 9 : Dynamin and DLPs in disease Aberrant dynamin and DLP’s function has been linked to many diseases including cancer . Dynamin has been found to be upregulated in malignant cells , and to support increased cell migration in vitro and metastasis in vivo [ 226 ] . Dynamin interacts with microtubules and focal adhesion kinase to modulate cell migration [ 227 ] , while also affecting lamellipodia formation [ 228 ] . Dynamin does this through interaction with a GTPase , Rac1’s guanine exchange factor ( GEF ) Vav1 . Vav1 along with other GEFs activates Rac1 [ 229 ] . Rac1 then regulates actin dynamics including the branching important in lamellipodia formation [ 230 ] . In T - cells dynamin - 2 was shown to directly interact with Vav1 [ 231 ] . Vav1 is an oncogene expressed in many cancers [ 232 , 233 ] . CXCL12 can activate JAK - Vav - Rac1 signalling in melanoma cells which then supports metastasis [ 234 ] . However in the P P ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 P P P P P ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 PTEN P13K SHIP1 P P ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 P Clathrin - mediated endocytosis Fast endophilin - mediated endocytosis endosome dynamin dynamin membrane P clathrin 23 absence of active dynamin Vav1 interacts instead with Hsc70 chaperone protein which directs Vav1 to lysosomes for degradation [ 229 ] . Mutations in DLP Drp - 1 has been found to drive mitosis in twenty - nine different cancer types and to modulate chemotherapy sensitivity of primary tumours . Relapse in ovarian cancers treated with platinum - based chemotherapy has been linked to Drp - 1 / mitochondrial - driven mitosis [ 235 ] . Inhibition of Drp - 1 has been shown to reduce migration and invasion of thyroid cancer cells [ 236 ] . 1 . 16 . 10 : Dynamin in cancer development and progression Cancer features unregulated cell proliferation , migration and endocytosis ; signalling controls these factors and the survival of cancer cells . Endosomal signalling can enhance metastasis e . g . aberrant sorting decisions favouring endosome recycling over degradation for proliferative signalling cargoes [ 199 ] . Mutations and loss of proteins that ubiquitinate receptors in endosomes can change the fate of oncogenic receptors directed to lysosomes , causing them to be recycled back to the plasma membrane and prolong signalling . If this signalling supports cell proliferation and / or migration it can favour cancer and metastasis . Scaffolding proteins , cargo and dynamin can all influence the fate of the endosome [ 194 , 198 ] . Mechanisms include upregulation of dynamin which can by increasing clathrin - coated pit initiation and maturation support aberrant clathrin mediated endocytosis [ 192 ] . Proliferative signalling can be produced by the Pi3K / PIP2 / PIP3 / Akt / mTOR pathway . PTEN tumour suppressor inhibits the PIP 2 to PIP 3 step , whereas Akt inhibits constitutively active GSK3β which when active suppresses dynamin - 1 . Overactive dynamin - 1 enhances clathrin - coated pit initiation and clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Akt - GSK3β signalling is upregulated in endosomes with APPL1 scaffolds [ 192 ] . Activated dynamin - 1 appears to support APPL1 endosome production and Akt signalling [ 196 ] . Akt inhibitors can be shown to dynamin - 1 - dependently inhibit clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 192 ] . Dynamin - 1 is controlled by phosphorylation so its activity and expression do not necessarily correlate . The calcium - dependent phosphatase calcineurin can dephosphorylate and so activate dynamin - 1 [ 171 ] . Thus dynamin recruitment can regulate the initiation and maintenance of clathrin - coated pits , and increase endocytic activity which itself may correlate with metastatic potential . 24 1 . 16 . 11 : Drp - 1 , mitochondrial division and cancer Mitochondrial fusion is aided by the DLP Mfn isoforms Mfn1 and Mfn2 along with OPA1 [ 237 ] , which create links between fusing mitochondria . Mfn2 also aids mitochondrial - Endoplasmic Reticulum ( ER ) linkage facilitating mitochondrial calcium uptake [ 238 ] . Mitochondria undergo division and fusion , governed by genes in the cell nucleus [ 239 ] . Disorders of mitochondrial dynamics can contribute to the pathology of cancer , since mitochondrial fission and fusion fine - tunes cell - cycle progression , majorly influencing ATP production , reactive oxygen species production , oxygen sensitivity and apoptosis [ 240 ] . Mitochondria associate with the ER facilitating localised peaks in calcium signalling [ 241 ] , which can trigger apoptosis [ 242 ] . Calmodulin - dependent kinase links the phosphorylation of Drp - 1 to calcium levels [ 243 ] . Defective mitochondria are disposed of by enclosing in autophagic vacuoles which then merge with lysosomes in a process called mitophagy [ 244 ] . Mitophagy is more efficient with smaller organelles created by mitochondria fission . Smaller mitochondria also more efficiently accelerate cell proliferation . Fission is facilitated by Drp - 1 [ 245 ] . Drp - 1 monomers co - operate , creating a ring - like structure which constricts and divides the mitochondrion [ 246 ] . In cancer there is excess proliferation along with apoptosis resistance . Respiration shifts from oxidative metabolism to aerobic glycolysis , this is called the ‘Warburg Effect’ . Mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activation contributes to this by suppressing oxidative metabolism and inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase making the cell less susceptible to apoptosis [ 247 , 248 ] . ATP production and mitochondrial division is needed before mitosis , these processes are co - ordinated as the cell cycles from stage G 1 to S . Drp - 1 inhibition triggers mitochondrial hyperfusion into larger mitochondria , which facilitates increased ATP production [ 249 ] . DNA replication then occurs and cyclin E accumulates . Cyclin B1 - cyclin - dependent kinase 1 ( CDK1 ) initiates mitosis and activates Drp - 1 via phosphorylation of its Ser 616 , this triggers mitochondria fission facilitating cell division [ 250 ] . Drp - 1 is controlled by various kinases . Drp - 1 activity , so mitochondrial replication , is increased by phosphorylation at Ser 616 , and decreased by phosphorylation of Drp - 1 Ser 637 [ 251 ] , figure 1 . 13 . 25 Figure 1 . 13 : Drp - 1 influences mitochondria fission / fusion dynamics during the cell cycle [ 249 , 252 ] . Drp - 1 inhibition can inhibit tumour growth , increasing spontaneous apoptosis and decreasing cell proliferation and metastasis [ 252 , 253 ] and change cell morphology to a more rounded shape unsuited to migration [ 254 ] . Once initiated the signalling from a chemokine receptor is transmitted through various membrane and cytosolic proteins . A key protein often involved in this signal transduction is Protein Kinase C . 1 . 17 : Protein Kinase C ( PKC ) Homeostatic PKC signalling is exquisitely complex and in cancer this complexity increases . PKC responses can be modulated by chemokines . Differences in distribution of PKC isoforms in normal and malignant leukocytes have been reported [ 255 , 256 ] , hence PKC assays using cancer cell - lines may produce differing results to those in non - malignant cells . Activating PKCs can protect against induced lung metastasis and reduce tumour growth ( in mice ) [ 257 ] and produce temporary remission from leukaemia in humans [ 258 ] . Hence in human cancers PKCs can act as tumour suppressors , however they can also act as oncogenes [ 259 , 260 ] 1 . 17 . 1 : PKC structure , isoforms , location and function PKC is transcribed from nine PKC genes producing twelve isoforms as some genes produce splice variants . All isoforms contain a C - terminal kinase and a variable N - terminal auto - inhibitory regulatory domain that determines both the PKC subfamily , and through interactions with its respective C - terminal kinase moiety , if the protein is active or not [ 261 ] . PKC isoforms are classified as conventional ( isoforms α , β , and γ ) , novel ( δ , ε , η , and θ ) and atypical ( ζ and ι ) , figure 1 . 14 . PKC enzymes contain a catalytic C - terminal ATP binding domain , and a regulatory unit that keeps PKC inactive until triggered and controls its subcellular location . Mitosis Phosphorylation of Drp - 1 Ser 637 inhibits Drp - 1 triggering mitochondrial hyperfusion DNAreplication Smaller mitochondria aids dispersion to opposite poles Mitochondrial fusion Mitophagy G O G 1 Larger mitochondria = ATP production↑ Phosphorylation of Drp - 1 Ser 616 triggers Drp - 1 activity hence mitochondrial fission cytokinesis 26 Figure 1 . 14 : PKC isoenzymes , domains and activators [ 261 , 262 ] . Diacylglycerol ( DAG ) can activate conventional and novel , but not atypical PKC isoforms . DAG is a lipid metabolism intermediate , its level in cells is modulated by PLC activation [ 263 ] . Conventional PKCs all have a C2 domain that calcium dependently binds phospholipids along with two cysteine - rich zinc finger regions C1a and C1b at the amino - terminus . Conventional PKCs remain in the cytosol until activated by the activation of DAG ; they then translocate to the membrane to bind DAG [ 264 ] . Novel PKCs also have C1 and C2 domains but with the C2 nearest the N - terminus , and their C2 region lacks calcium binding regions so membrane translocation is not controlled by calcium or phospholipids but occurs just as efficiently as with conventional PKCs as their affinity for DAG is greater [ 265 , 266 ] . Atypical PKC’s activation is independent of DAG and calcium , their C1 domain is activated by PIP 3 [ 267 ] or ceramide [ 268 , 269 ] . Also they also have a PB1 motif at their N - terminal which reacts with other PB1 containing proteins and 3 - phosphoinositide - dependent protein kinase 1 ( PDPK1 ) [ 270 , 271 ] . Partition Defective Protein ( PAR ) - 6 and PKCζ interact through their PB1 domains [ 272 ] , PAR6 links PKCζ to Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 involved in Ras oncogenic transformation and cell polarity [ 273 , 274 ] . 1 . 17 . 2 : PKC’s phosphorylation of chemokine receptors GPCR phosphorylation is a complex process involving many kinases . There is considerable redundancy with several kinases each able to phosphorylate several , usually C - terminal , sites . CXCL12 / CXCR4 activation is no exception and purportedly involves multiple kinases including GPCR kinases ( GRKs ) and PKC isoforms [ 275 - 277 ] . CXCR4 C - terminal has three threonines and fifteen serines . Research has demonstrated phosphorylation of seven serines following CXCR4 stimulation by GRKs and PKC [ 278 ] . Other studies support phosphorylation by PKC of CXCR4 DAG Ca 2 + ATP binding Ca 2 + binding Activation loop P P P PIP 3 C1A C1B N - C2 C3 - C C4 Catalytic activation regionP P P N - C1A C1B Novel - C2 C3 - C C4 Catalytic activation region P P P N - C3 - C C4 Catalytic activation regionP P P Atypical C1 PB1 Regulatory motifs Kinase domains Activators DAG Lipid Lipid PAR6 Cdc42 Conventional α , β , γ Novel δ , ε , η , θ Atypical ξ , ι 27 following CXCL12 binding [ 279 ] . Also CXCL12 induced CXCR4 C - tail phosphorylation can be inhibited by GRK , PKCα PKCδ or PKCζ inhibition [ 280 ] . 1 . 17 . 3 : PKC activation PKC resides in the cytosol until activated by agonist interaction with receptor [ 262 ] . Activation triggers conformational changes allowing PKC to interact in specific cellular locations with defined substrates , which substrate is governed by PKC C1a domain [ 281 ] . With conventional PKCα , PIP2 hydrolysis leads to PKC activation , firstly by calcium binding PKCα C2 domain facilitating interactions with membrane phospholipids and PKCα activation by binding DAG embedded in membrane [ 282 , 283 ] . The novel PKCs including PKCδ and PKCε do not bind calcium but have a greater affinity for DAG than conventional PKC’s so primarily move to and signal from Golgi membranes which are richer in DAG than cell membranes [ 261 ] . Atypical PKCs including PKCζ have a lower catalytic activity than DAG - regulated novel or conventional PKCs ; atypicals bind scaffold proteins e . g . PAR6 via PB1 Domains [ 284 , 285 ] . Different scaffolds produce different PKC activity levels e . g . PAR6 activates , whereas PAR3 binds atypical PKC’s active site preventing substrate access and activation [ 286 ] . Scaffolding proteins can modulate PKC location and signalling . PKC N - terminal regions contain regulatory regions that produce different isoform responses to different activators [ 287 ] . PKC isoforms can be activated by the same stimulus but then be directed to different cellular locations , for example Golgi , nuclear envelope , endoplasmic reticulum or specific cytoskeletal components inside mitochondria or the nucleus [ 288 ] . At these locations various scaffolding , adaptor or targeting proteins link the PKC with their substrates so can translate the extracellular signal to specific cellular microenvironments [ 289 ] . These PKC binding proteins include actin , importins , heat shock proteins ( HSP ) , 14 - 3 - 3 proteins , receptors for activated C - kinase ( RACKs ) , A - kinase - anchoring protein ( AKAPs ) and Annexins , figure 1 . 15 . 28 Figure 1 . 15 : PKC isoenzymes interact with scaffolding proteins which can selectively modulate the PKCs location and signalling , for example an annexin or anchoring protein such as RACK1 can regulate recruitment of specific PKC isoenzyme to the membrane or other subcellular location where PKC may phosphorylate nearby substrates [ 287 - 289 ] . 1 . 17 . 4 : PKCs role in cancers Conventional and novel PKC inactivation is governed by metabolism and decay of DAG these PKCs then return to their auto - inhibited conformation and reside in the cytosol [ 290 ] . With atypical PKCs other PKC isoforms may be involved in their inactivation [ 291 ] . Abnormal PKC expression has been implicated in many pathophysiologies including cancers [ 292 , 293 ] . However PKC is not a simple proto - oncogene , it actually supports homeostasis , but modifying PKC regulation may support malignancies [ 262 ] . This includes through Raf - 1 signalling triggering Mitogen - Activation Protein Kinase ( MAPK ) promoted metastasis , and proliferation normally prevented by PKC regulation [ 294 ] . In cancers loss of function ( LOF ) or loss of normal signalling of PKC isoforms is common and gain of function ( GOF ) rare [ 261 ] . LOF mutations are generally heterozygous and can be dominant negative which then adversely influences global PKC signalling , i . e . one isoenzyme mutation may suppress other PKC isoenzyme signalling [ 259 ] . This may be due to common elements in PKC isoenzyme activation being sequestered by the mutated PKC e . g . PDPK1 [ 295 ] . It has been observed that PKCα has reduced function in pituitary tumours [ 296 ] and that PKCα inhibitors enzastaurin and aprinocarsen worsened outcomes when given with chemotherapy for lung cancers [ 297 ] . PKC signalling can suppress oncogenic mutated K - Ras signalling , and can inhibit oncogenic signalling by promoting internalisation of receptors such as PKCα nucleus Ca 2 + AKAPS Ca 2 + PLC IP3 Ca 2 + PKCδ PKCε PKCζ R A C K 1 annexins Lipid raft Golgi secretary vesicles mitochondria centrosome Plasma membrane Ca 2 + Ca 2 + Ca 2 + Ca 2 + PKCα Nucleus endoplasmic reticulum Rising diacylglycerol & Ca 2 + triggers PKC translocation to membrane or other subcellular locations 29 Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) and HER2 ( Human - EFGR - 2 ) which promote cell growth and survival [ 298 - 300 ] . Functional PKC can also keep growth factor receptor signalling in check , PKC may inhibit receptors , including GPCRs by phosphorylation of their cytoplasmic loops in a dynamin - dependent manner [ 301 ] . PKCα can also inhibit K - Ras , so may suppress malignant cell growth by suppressing oncogenes , as K - Ras is frequently mutated in cancers where there is LOF of PKC [ 259 , 302 ] . The gene for PKCδ is deleted in many skin cancers , re - expression in a mouse model suppresses malignant cell growth [ 303 ] . However PKCδ is implicated in promoting pancreatic cancers [ 260 ] and in cell - lines PKCδ depletion can induce apoptosis and PKCδ upregulation protects from apoptosis [ 304 ] , so depending on oncogene expression PKCδ can promote malignant growth , survival and ERK signalling downstream of PKCδ [ 305 ] or inhibit it . Results of PKC investigations in malignant cell - lines may therefore be cell - type specific . 1 . 17 . 5 : PKCs as oncoproteins and as tumour suppressors Novel PKCs may act as oncoproteins e . g . PKCδ has roles in survival and apoptosis , opposing receptor - initiated apoptosis , and supporting apoptosis triggered by DNA damage [ 306 , 307 ] . PKCδ increased expression may worsen outcome in HER2 positive breast cancer , but in endometrial cancers decreased PKCδ expression correlates with higher grade tumour , hence PKCδ can drive some cancers and inhibit others . Hormone sensitivity may govern if PKC GOF or LOF favours malignant cell survival [ 308 , 309 ] . PKCε expression can be elevated in prostate and breast cancers [ 310 ] and ablation of PKCε may inhibit prostate cancer development and metastasis ( in mice ) . Inhibiting PKCε can cause Gi / S cell cycle arrest . PKCε can phosphorylate Signal Transducers and Activator of Transcription - 3 ( STAT3 ) Ser 727 triggering nuclear translocation ; hence PKCε can regulate transcription factors including , STAT3 activity in some cancers . STAT3 activation also links to COX - 2 activation [ 311 ] so inflammation . STATs are transcription factors phosphorylated by receptor associated Janus Kinases ( JAKs ) , which respond to specific cytokines , including chemokines , producing cell migration , proliferation and survival [ 312 ] . 1 . 18 : JAK STAT Signalling . The JAK family contains the ubiquitously distributed JAK1 , JAK2 and Tyk2 , plus JAK3 which is found mostly in hematopoietic cells . The STATs are intracellular transcription factors influencing cell immunity , differentiation , proliferation and apoptosis . The STAT family consists of STAT1 - STAT4 , STAT5 ( A & B ) and STAT6 . STAT3 is often activated in tumours and has been implicated in in 30 cancer progression . STAT3 appears important in immune responses to malignancy and in resistance to chemotherapy . GPCR’s activation of STAT3 via JAK2 is associated with cancer [ 312 - 316 ] . STAT3 appears to hold a key role in cancer initiation , progression and prognosis , and is often elevated in blood and breast malignancies [ 317 , 318 ] . Tyrosine phosphorylation by JAKs is purportedly required for most cytokine responses . JAKs’ association with cytokine receptors is enhanced by cytokine ligand binding , and JAK responses include tyrosine phosphorylation of their associated receptor , this opens docking sites for both STATs and PLC ; activated PLC signalling can then trigger calcium release from intracellular reservoirs [ 319 - 321 ] . JAKs’ phosphorylation of receptor tyrosines facilitates STAT phosphorylation , dimerization , transfer to nucleus and initiation of transcription [ 312 ] . G αi can be inactivated by pertussis toxin ( PTX ) . PTX is an A - B toxin , the A subunit ribosylates and uncouples α subunits of G αi from the receptor , the B protomer reportedly can bind cell surface proteins including Toll - like receptor 4 and activate intracellular signalling cascades [ 322 ] hence PTX can be used to investigate the involvement of G αi in CXCR4 / CXCL12 signalling . Vila - Coro et al . ( 1999 ) published evidence that CXCR4 / CXCL12 signalling involved G αi , JAK phosphorylation , JAK phosphorylation of CXCR4 dimers , STAT association with CXCR4 and subsequent dimerization via SH2 - phosphotrosyl interactions then movement to the nucleus [ 323 ] . 1 . 18 . 1 : JAK2 in malignancies JAK2 gene mutations are common in myeloproliferative neoplasms . STAT signalling downstream of JAK kinases is reportedly enhanced in malignant cells [ 324 ] . JAK2 mutations have been shown to increase chemotactic responses of CXCR4 to CXCL12 and also both retention and maintenance of haematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow , plus their movement to extramedullary sites producing myelofibrosis . Normally haematopoietic stem cells and haematopoietic stem progenitor cells divide and differentiate in the bone marrow but in myeloproliferative neoplasms extramedullary haematopoiesis occurs for example in the spleen [ 325 ] . CXCR4 functions to retain haematopoietic stem cells in the bone medullary this can be antagonised by CXCR4 inhibitors including AMD3100 ( Plerixafor ) [ 326 ] . In myeloproliferative neoplasms CXCR4 sensitivity may be increased even in CXCR4 downregulation [ 327 ] . JAK2 mutations or cytokines may trigger oncogenic activation synergistically with CXCR4 / CXCL12 signalling facilitating Pi3K signalling and chemotaxis [ 328 ] . A JAK1 / 2 inhibitor ruxolitinib is currently licenced for treating myeloproliferative neoplasm polycythemia vera [ 329 ] . PKC and JAK2 signalling may influence metastasis , but the process of cell migration is co - ordinated by Rho GTPases regulating cell polarity , adhesion , actin polymerization and cytoskeletal dynamics . 31 1 . 19 : Rho GTPases in cell migration Rho GTPases are members of the Ras family of proteins and are molecular switches , they are ‘off’ when GDP - bound and ‘on’ when in GTP - bound conformation but are also modulated by post - translational modifications and influenced by other proteins when in complexes [ 330 ] . Active Rho GTPases interact with effectors downstream to initiate various signalling pathways [ 331 ] . Location is key for Rho GTPases . Although Rho GTPases have sequence and structural homology each can control specific cellular responses within tightly controlled spatial - temporal activation and signalling [ 332 ] . There are over twenty Rho GTPase family members , each with several isoforms , three Rho GTPases involved with the actin cytoskeleton are RhoA , Rac1 and Cdc42 . RhoA is involved with contraction at the cell’s rear related to actomycin , Cdc42 with filopodia formation at the leading edge , and Rac1 with lamellipodia and membrane ruffles [ 331 , 333 ] . Rac1 regulates lamellipodia formation and so is key to cell motility ; it is most active at a cells leading edge [ 334 ] . Rho GTPases can undergo lipid modification of their C - terminal . Usually this is prenylation , the addition of farnesyl or geranylgeranyl unit to a C - terminal cysteine commonly the Cis in terminal CAAX motif . This may be followed by S - palmatoylation at a nearby cysteine . The effect of prenylation is to allow the GTPase to insert and anchor in a cell or organelle membrane . For example Rac1 palmitoylation increases the GTPase stability and activity , and may determine the subcellular location of the protein . Rac1 is prenylated at Cys 189 , then palmitoylated at Cys 178 [ 335 ] , figure 1 . 16 . Figure 1 . 16 : Human Rac1 sequence , showing Switch I and Switch II regions , C - terminus cysteines Cys 178 and Cys 189 ( underlined ) , and W56 Rac1 active peptide ( used in chapter 8 ) residues in red .

Rho GTPases can be activated by GPCRs including chemokine receptors [ 336 ] . There are three controllers of Rho GTPases . ( i ) Firstly Rho - specific guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors ( Rho GDIs ) , these can bind GDP - bound Rho GTPases and can sequester them in the cytosol by masking the COOH prenylation [ 337 ] . There are at least three known Rho GDI mammalian isoforms each containing two key motifs , the N - terminal domain which binds Rho GTPases’ Switch I and Switch II regions , see figure 1 . 16 , and the C - terminus domain which through interactions with Rho GTPases including the Switch II region facilitate the release of Rho GTPases from lipid membranes [ 338 - 340 ] . ( ii ) Secondly there are GTPase - Activating Proteins ( Rho GAPs ) which by augmenting the speeding up of the intrinsic GTPase - hydrolysis turn the GTPase ‘off’ . Several Rho GAPs have been identified , many exhibiting Rho GTPase specificity , including ARHGAP15 and FilGAP which act on Rac1 [ 341 , 342 ] . ( iii ) Finally there are guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( Rho GEFs ) which promote activation of the GTPase and so exchange of GDP for GTP [ 338 ] . There are seventy or more Rho GEFs classified into two families , DOCK and DBL , depending on structure ; they interact with GTPase Switch regions as do GAPs and GDIs [ 330 , 343 ] . Rho GEFs are usually regulated by phosphorylation , which may activate or inhibit depending on GEF . Phosphorylation produces 14 - 3 - 3 protein docking sites . 14 - 3 - 3 proteins usually inhibit GEF activity . 14 - 3 - 3ζ binds GEF T - lymphoma invasion and metastasis - inducing protein - 1 ( Tiam1 ) recruiting Tiam1 to adhesion complexes where it activates Rac1 supporting cell migration and chemotaxis [ 344 ] . Tiam1 is a pro - invasion factor of T - lymphocytes . It activates Rac1 but also influences polarity in migrating cells , by binding PAR3 in the PAR polarity complex , which includes PAR3 , PAR6 and atypical PKC . Tiam1 promotes the PAR complex which regulates cell front - rear polarization and the formation of cell - cell junctions [ 345 ] . Inhibition of TIAM1 can support migration indirectly by promoting cell - cell junction disassembly . Also inhibition of PKC can inhibit chemotaxis . Tiam1 therefore exhibits some control over chemotaxis via the PAR complex . Research suggests different cell - lines appear to have different GEFs activating Rac1 . In lymphocytes Rac activation can be triggered via Rac - specific GEF DOCK2 only found in 33 hematopoietic cells . In HER2 positive breast cancers Rac1 was found activated through Akt signalling stimulating Tiam1 and via PKC signalling inhibiting a Rac1 guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor , RhoGDI2 [ 346 - 350 ] . Additionally GTPase Rac1 can be regulated by phosphorylation , including by focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) or SRC on Tyr 64 , and by AKT on Ser 71 , both raise levels of GDP - bound Rac1 . Tyr 64 and Ser 71 lie in the Rac1’s Switch II region , figure 1 . 16 ; phosphorylation of these residues appears to hinder GTP binding [ 351 , 352 ] . ERK can trigger Rac1 phosphorylation at Thr 108 causing Rac1 translocation into nucleus where it is unavailable to GEFs , and can interact with NFκB and β - catenin and may support Wnt signalling plus RhoA - governed malignant cell invasion [ 353 - 356 ] . 1 . 20 : Pi3K and FAK signalling in metastasis Sequences of events following a cell surface receptor sensing a chemokine gradient can include phosphoinositide - 3 - kinase ( Pi3K ) signalling which triggers the formation of PIP 3 at the cell’s leading edge and actin cytoskeleton reorganisation resulting in lamellipodia formation [ 357 ] . This involves a dense intracellular matrix of actin filaments forming within the lamellipodium which can move the cell membrane forward , but also supports the formation of adhesion complexes that link to and grip the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) meshwork giving the cell traction to flow forward [ 358 ] . Adhesion complexes are dynamic structures composed of scaffolding proteins such as integrins that bind to ECM fibronectin and to actin via proteins such as paxillin and talin [ 359 ] . These adhesion complexes grip the ECM as the cell flows past their location , then are disassembled when located near the uropod , by microtubules transporting calpains and FAK to the complex [ 227 , 360 ] . FAK phosphorylation of paxillin , and calpain’s severing of talin , effectively then disunite the ECM link . Adhesion complex proteins and FAK may then undergo ubiquitination or be recycled back to the leading edge [ 361 , 362 ] . Membrane phospholipids to expand the lamellipodium leading edge in response to chemotactic chemokines can be supplied by polarized microtubule exocytosis and facilitated by autophagy . Autophagy includes facilitated degradation of focal adhesion proteins and actin remodelling proteins . Chemokine receptors such as CXCR4 have been implicated in the control of autophagic flux facilitating metastasis [ 363 ] . Thus metastasis involves cell polarisation and leading edge formation involving Rho family members Cdc42 , Rac and Rho interacting with Pi3K signalling and FAK phosphorylation , however another key protein involved with actin filament dynamics is cofilin . 34 1 . 21 : Signalling linking cofilin to chemotactic metastasis Actin filament remodelling is essential for cells to physically migrate . Actin filaments mainly grow from ‘barbed’ ends . Such actin dynamics can be modulated by cofilin , a small 19 kDa protein which forms co - filaments with actin , initiating actin severing and depolymerisation and so providing a source of actin initiation barbed ends along with monomers which can be recycled to growing actin filaments at a cell’s leading edge which then push the cell membrane forward , facilitating chemotaxis . This is an ATP - dependent process ; cofilin has high affinity for ADP - actin and low affinity for ATP - actin and so functions to break - up old filaments [ 364 , 365 ] . Studies show cofilin expression is upregulated in many solid tumours , in adherent cell - lines including A549 and HeLa , and in malignant leukocytes and suspension cell - lines including Jurkat and HL60 . Cofilin has also been shown to aid EMT and metastasis . Chemotaxis has been shown to positively correlate with cofilin expression [ 366 - 372 ] . 1 . 21 . 1 : Cofilin phosphorylation and dynamics Active cofilin binds actin filaments , disassembling them from the minus end by modifying the actin twist causing filament strain followed by filament fragmentation . Cofilin is activated by dephosphorylation on Ser 3 , which lies in its actin - binding site [ 373 , 374 ] , by phosphatases including PP1 / PP2 , Calcineurin and Slingshot , activation can be modulated by signalling including through Pi3K [ 375 , 376 ] . Cofilin is inactivated by LIM kinase ( LIMK ) phosphorylation , which is mediated by Rho GTPases [ 377 ] . However cofilin’s cellular activities are multi - layered and complex ; for example , cofilin may have feedback effects on stimulated receptors by interacting with phospholipase D1 , as phosphorylated cofilin can stimulate phospholipase D1 activity triggering cellular responses such as calcium mobilisation and apoptosis , membrane hydrolysis , and actin stress fibre formation [ 378 ] . Cofilin phosphorylation is also influenced by pH , ROS and membrane lipids . Only un - phosphorylated cofilin can sever actin [ 377 , 379 ] . Three isoforms of Slingshot occur in humans , SSH1L , SSH2L and SSH3L . The activities of slingshot phosphatases are influenced by regulatory proteins including 14 - 3 - 3ζ . 14 - 3 - 3 proteins bind phosphorylated Slingshot sequestering the phosphatase in the cytoplasm away from F - actin in the lamellipodia and cell protrusions [ 380 ] . Protein Kinase D ( PKD ) can phosphorylate serines in the carboxy - terminus of Slingshot , and this induces 14 - 3 - 3 scaffold proteins to bind and sequester Slingshot in the cytoplasm , reducing active Slingshot levels in lamellipodia . Reducing phosphatase activity on cofilin can increase local levels of phosphocofilin occur in lamellipodia . Slingshot also dephosphorylates and inactivates LIMK1 . 14 - 3 - 3 bound Slingshot may then dephosphorylate LIMK1 in the cytosol , leaving active cofilin in the actin - rich lamellipodia in migrating cells [ 381 - 35 383 ] . In metabolic stress , which can be triggered by high cholesterol or blood glucose , 14 - 3 - 3ζ undergoes S - glutathionylation and degradation by caspases . This frees Slingshot to activate cofilin , stimulating actin turnover plus remodelling , and has been found to increase THP - 1 sensitivity towards CCL2 [ 384 ] . There are two LIMK subtypes , LIMK1 and LIMK2 ; they are serine - threonine specific and both contain many cysteine residues and two zinc fingers . LIMKs can be regulated by Rho GTPases [ 385 ] . LIMKs are involved in a wide range of cellular processes including mediating the actin cytoskeletal structure via phosphorylation of cofilin [ 386 ] . LIMK can activated by several routes including : phosphorylation of a threonine in LIMK’s catalytic domain [ 385 , 387 , 388 ] ; phosphorylation of Ser 323 ; and inactivated by caspase - 3 proteolysis of LIMK Asp - 240 [ 389 , 390 ] , figure 1 . 17 . Figure 1 . 17 : Some of the many signalling pathways modulating LIMK activation [ 385 , 387 - 390 ] . Both LIMK and cofilin have been shown to moderate other signalling pathways ; and dephosphorylated cofilin to localise to mitochondria [ 391 ] . If dephosphorylated cofilin translocates to mitochondria it raises membrane permeability allowing cytochrome C release , caspase 9 Apat - 1 cleavage and activation , then caspase - 3 activation and cell apoptosis [ 391 ] . Overall the literature suggests the many influences on cofilin activation may interact and are often cell type specific . Cofilin phosphorylation state is not a direct measure of cofilin activity , although total phosphorylation has been shown to increase following ligand stimulation of cells [ 392 ] . This is explained as the active cofilin ( un - phosphorylated ) and phosphocofilin may be in different cellular ‘locations’ such as the cytosol , the F - actin location between cytosol and membrane , and at the membrane . Cofilin does not evenly spread throughout the cell , it clusters . Where clusters are Cofilin LIMK2 ROCK Rac PAK = p21 - activated protein kinase MAPK = mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) LIMK1 Phosphorylation of LIMK1 thr - 508 Phosphorylation of LIMK Ser - 323 MAPK LIMK partial proteolysis by caspase - 3 at Asp - 240 Caspase - 3 Affinity of cofilin for actin reduced Cofilin Cdc42 RhoA Phosphorylation of LIMK2 thr - 505 P 36 juxtaposed to older actin filaments un - phosphorylated cofilin can sever actin , forming new barbed ends and monomers which trigger actin polymerization , that is key to cell migration and metastasis [ 373 , 379 , 393 ] . Also cofilin’s protein sequence contains nuclear location signals which allow cofilin to carry depolymerized actin into the nucleus [ 394 ] . In the nucleus cofilin may form actin rod - like structures [ 395 ] , and be phosphorylated by LIMK1 [ 396 ] ; the transported actin may remodel chromatin [ 397 ] and bind RNA polymerase modulating gene transcription [ 398 ] . Hence cofilin may indirectly influence gene expression . 1 . 21 . 2 : Phospholipid phosphatidylinositol - ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate influences on cofilin Cofilin activity can be assisted by actin - interacting protein ( Aip1 ) and adenylyl cyclase - associated protein ( CAP ) . Aip1 and cofilin form a complex that can stop severed actin reannealing by capping barbed ends . An Aip1 : cofilin : CAP complex then frees cofilin from ADP - actin to continue severing [ 399 ] . PIP 2 in the cell membrane can also sequester the Ser 3 site of cofilin , rending notionally ‘active’ un - phosphorylated cofilin inactive . The cofilin - PIP 2 complex is transient and dynamic , with membrane PIP 2 rapidly binding then releasing active cofilin . PLCγ activation causes a decrease in levels of PIP 2 , and so reduces the amount available that can bind cofilin i . e . decreases binding but not the release of cofilin ; hence this can effectively increase the actual levels of active cofilin near the membrane juxtaposed to plentiful F - actin [ 379 , 400 , 401 ] . CXCL12 / CXCR4 signalling through Pi3K , Rho and Rho - associated protein kinase ( ROCK ) pathways can activate LIMK and PLCγ . Whereas LIMK causes generalised cofilin phosphorylation throughout the cytosol , PLCγ acts locally near the membrane increasing levels of active cofilin , as explained above , near the receptors receiving CXCL12 stimulus , supporting directional lamellipodium formation towards the chemokine stimulus [ 379 , 402 - 405 ] . Additionally , a pH rise may cause a decrease in PIP 2 / cofilin affinity and increases PLCγ activation of cofilin [ 406 ] , figure 1 . 18 . Figure 1 . 18 : Signalling resulting in phospholipid PIP 2 sequestering cofilin [ 379 , 402 - 406 ] . Cofilin ( active ) Cofilin ( inactive ) PIP 2 Cofilin Phospho LIMK PLCγ Pi3K Rho ROCK + + + + + CXCR4 α γ P CXCL12 β + PIP 2 + 37 Cofilin activity upregulation in cancer cells can be a major driver of metastasis and hamper DNA repair [ 407 , 408 ] . Prostaglandin E 2 ( PGE 2 ) can stimulate PTEN to dephosphorylate so activate cofilin [ 409 ] . Hence blocking PGE 2 production using Non - Steroidal Anti - inflammatory Drugs ( NSAIDs ) may , via inhibition of cofilin , inhibit cell migration . 1 . 22 : Non - Steroidal - Anti - inflammatory Drugs ( NSAIDs ) and metastasis The connection between inflammation and cancer is well established ; inflammation is purportedly highly tumorigenic and links to chemokine chemotaxis [ 410 , 411 ] . NSAIDs are reported to have useful prophylactic effects for some solid tumours , although effects on haematopoietic malignancies risk are less clear [ 412 ] ; also they may affect metastatic spread [ 413 ] . 1 . 22 . 1 : Selective and non - selective NSAIDs Commonly prescribed NSAIDs include ibuprofen , naproxen , aspirin and celecoxib . Ibuprofen , aspirin and naproxen are non - selective inhibitors of prostaglandin - endoperoxide synthase 1 and 2 more commonly known as cyclooxygenase 1 ( COX1 ) and 2 ( COX2 ) , whereas celecoxib is a selective COX2 inhibitor [ 414 ] . All NSAIDs inhibit COX1 or COX2 or both , these enzymes catalyse the conversion of Arachidonic Acid ( AA ) to Prostaglandin H 2 ( PGH 2 ) . The fatty acid AA is produced by hydrolysis of the fatty acid / glycerol bond in membrane phospholipids by one of the many phospholipase A 2 isoenzymes [ 415 ] . COX enzymes have cyclooxygenase and peroxidase actions ; they catalyse the cyclization of AA to unstable 15 - hydroxyperoxide then their peroxidase action produces PGH 2 . PGH 2 is also unstable and so is converted by isomerases to prostaglandins ( PGD 2 , PGE 2 or PGF 2 ) , prostacyclin ( PGI 2 ) or thromboxanes ( TXA 2 , TXB 2 ) depending on tissue isomerase / s present . Many of these derivatives have inflammatory , pyretic or nociceptive effects [ 416 ] . PGE 2 is also produced by cancer cells as COX2 expression is induced by inflammatory and mitogenic stimuli , such as cytokines and growth factors . PGE 2 supports inflammatory T - cell Th 17 activity , and recruits monocytes and neutrophils . Also COX2 derived PGE 2 can promote angiogenesis [ 417 ] . 1 . 22 . 2 : Paracetamol’s complex mode of action Paracetamol is widely used in pain management , it also inhibits COX enzymes but its mode of action is complex ; it appears to act locally [ 418 ] ; peripherally [ 419 ] including through cannabinoid receptors ; centrally in the spine [ 420 ] including via serotonin 5 - HT 3 receptors coupling to Gs and cAMP production ; and in the brain via transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype 1 ( TRPV1 ) non - selective Ca 2 + channels [ 421 ] . Paracetamol weakly inhibits prostaglandin synthesis with more COX2 than COX1 activity , it has weaker analgesic effects than NSAIDs and few anti - inflammatory effects [ 422 ] . Paracetamol appears to inhibit the peroxidase function of COX enzymes only when low , not high , levels of AA are available , and hence fails to effectively suppress inflammation . 38 Paracetamol also non - selectively inhibits other peroxidases . In monocytes paracetamol can reduce COX2 activity by 80 % [ 423 ] . Centrally paracetamol has an anti - nociceptive effect on 5 - HT 3 serotonin receptors ; this can be blocked with 5 - HT 3 antagonists [ 424 , 425 ] . PGE 2 modulates nociceptive signals via the serotoninergic anti - nociceptive system [ 426 ] so paracetamol’s analgesic effect may be directly on 5 - HT 3 receptors or via cyclooxygenases , figure 1 . 19 . Figure 1 . 19 : Modes of action of paracetamol , ibuprofen , naproxen and celecoxib [ 423 , 424 , 427 , 428 ] . Paracetamol can be de - acetylated to p - aminophenol which interacts with AA to form N - arachidonoyl phenylamine aka N - arachidonoyl aminophenol , which , by inhibiting the degradation and uptake of anandamide , can ( i ) indirectly increase activity of cannabinoid receptors [ 428 ] inhibiting endogenous cannabinoid reuptake , ( ii ) activate TRPV1 channels , agonists of which can inactivate nociceptive nerve fibres , cause vasodilation and modulate thermoregulation reducing temperature [ 427 , 429 , 430 ] , ( iii ) inhibit cyclooxygenases and ( iv ) inhibit selective transport and internalisation of anandamide by neurones [ 431 ] . Anandamide concentration appears key to paracetamol’s efficacy [ 432 , 433 ] . Endogenous cannabinoids have an anti - nociceptive action on spinal cord and brain pain pathways [ 427 ] . If cannabinoid receptors are inhibited paracetamol’s analgesic and antipyretic effect is blocked [ 434 ] . Paracetamol may also inhibit formation of the neurotransmitter nitrous oxide ( NO ) . Substance P and NMDA receptors activate NO synthesis , NO acts on the nociceptive pathways in the spinal cord leading to the brain [ 435 , 436 ] . 1 . 22 . 3 : Leukocytes and PGE 2 Prostaglandins such as PGE 2 are inflammatory mediators ; macrophage response to cytokines includes the secretion of PGE 2 which through autocrine signalling regulates their activity . PGE 2 can be produced by many tissues , and its production can be increased in cancer [ 437 ] . Raised PGE 2 levels can be immunosuppressive [ 438 ] , additionally PGE 2 has been shown to increase cell proliferation , migration and angiogenesis [ 439 ] . COX1 contributes to homeostasis , and is constitutively expressed in most cell types whereas COX2 can be induced in macrophages by mediators of inflammation . PKCα regulates macrophage PGE 2 responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharides and interferon - gamma via modulation of COX2 expression [ 440 ] . COX1 COX2 Paracetamol Celecoxib IbuprofenNaproxen Nitric oxide ( NO ) Cannabinoid signalling Serotonin 5HT 3 receptors Pain transmission through spinal pathways + + Aspirin 39 PGE 2 suppresses leukocyte activation and binds G - protein coupled E - prostanoid receptors 1 to 4 ( EP1 - EP4 ) . EP1 receptors increase G q G - protein and Ca 2 + responses ; EP2 and EP4 receptors through G s G - proteins increase Adenylyl Cyclase and cAMP levels ; and EP3 receptors through G i G - proteins reduce cAMP levels [ 441 ] . COX2 is the target of transcription factor Activator Protein - 1 ( AP - 1 ) . AP - 1 consists of cFos and cJun subunits expressed in response to stimuli including cytokines [ 442 ] . COX2 is one of the rate limiting enzymes in PGE 2 production ; excess PGE 2 inhibits macrophage and NK cell tumouricidal activity [ 443 ] . 1 . 22 . 4 : COX1 and COX2 , inflammation and cancer COX1 is constitutively active whereas COX2 isoform expression is inducible , for example , by mitogens or cytokines as COX2 is involved in inflammation [ 444 ] . NSAIDs may be therapeutic in malignant cells exhibiting certain mutations such as in Pi3K signalling [ 445 ] . Non - selective NSAIDs inhibit both COX1 and COX2 and may inhibit proliferation and accelerate apoptosis [ 446 ] . High levels of COX2 which is overexpressed in some cancers correlates with angiogenesis and mutagenesis [ 447 ] . Although epidemiological evidence shows aspirin and some NSAIDs can protect against tumour development or progression in the gut , dose and duration appear critical [ 448 , 449 ] , and the mechanisms need further elucidation . COX1 and COX2 are coded on separate genes [ 450 ] . Prostaglandins are involved in cellular differentiation ; PGE 2 production by COX2 appears important for colorectal cancer initiation and progression via stimulation of malignant cell proliferation , survival , invasiveness and tumour angiogenesis [ 451 , 452 ] . NSAIDs may hamper colorectal carcinogenesis by stimulating apoptosis or programmed cell death , as PGE 2 stimulates Pi3K / Akt pathways that protect colon cancer from apoptosis [ 453 ] . The Akt substrate GSK3β inactivates cJun and cMyc oncogenic transcription factors and negatively regulates Wnt signalling and β - catenin proto - oncoprotein and so suppresses tumour initiation [ 454 ] . Regular NSAIDs or aspirin may halve bowel cancer risk [ 455 ] , and reduce polyp formation in familial adenomatous polyposis [ 456 ] . Chemotherapy with cisplatin and radiation treatments may leave patients more vulnerable to the metastatic spread of tumour cells , spared by these therapies , as responses can include production of chemotactic cytokines , and tumour cell growth in damaged tissues . This vulnerability may be ameliorated by ibuprofen treatment [ 457 ] , possibly due to ibuprofen’s ability to inhibit PGE 2 production , and modulate calcium dynamics in remaining malignant cells [ 458 ] . 40 NSAIDs may have a COX - independent mechanism of opposing various malignancies . Non - selective NSAIDs irreversibly acetylate COX1 and competitively inhibit COX2 [ 459 ] , but different NSAIDs may act at different concentrations in different tissues e . g . Aspirin at low dose relatively selectively inhibits COX1 in platelets but above 500 μM only inhibits COX2 [ 460 , 461 ] . Inhibition of COX1 purportedly can cause gut ulceration , but COX2 expressed in the presence of damage may support mucosal integrity [ 462 ] . There is a link between inflammation and cancer , and pro - inflammatory IL - 1β and TNFα are potent inducers of COX2 . Chronic inflammation can trigger malignant transformation . PGE 2 levels are reported to positively correlate with metastatic potential of breast cancers [ 463 ] . Smoking can induce COX2 expression and PGE 2 release in metastatic breast cancer via phospholipid A2 - dependent pathways that support cell proliferation and migration [ 415 ] . PGE 2 may be able to inhibit apoptosis , reduce cellular adhesion , increase motility , promote immunosuppression and angiogenesis [ 464 , 465 ] . PGE 2 may promote anti - apoptotic effects via Pi3K - Akt & PPARδ signalling [ 466 ] ; support VEGF expression which itself stimulates cell proliferation [ 467 ] ; and induce cell proliferation by Raf / MEK / ERK and Pi3K / Akt signalling [ 468 ] that itself supports motility and invasion and through ERK2 / JNK1 signalling angiogenesis [ 469 ] . COX2 - produced PGE 2 is the principle prostaglandin produced in solid tumours [ 470 , 471 ] . In mice if EP1 , EP2 and EP4 are deleted or blocked by antagonists the animals resist carcinogen - mediated cancers [ 472 - 474 ] . EP1 , EP2 and EP4 over - expression occurs in breast cancers [ 475 ] . COX2 / PGE 2 may contribute to breast cancer growth via EP1 - PKC or PKA signalling upregulating aromatase , an enzyme which catalyses oestrogen biosynthesis in adipose tissues ; if adjacent to tumours this can support malignancy [ 476 , 477 ] . 1 . 22 . 5 : NSAIDs COX - independent antineoplastic effects Individual NSAIDs may have COX - independent prostaglandin - independent antineoplastic effects , e . g . celecoxib can induce expression of cyclins A , B and D causing cell cycle arrest in G1 phase [ 478 ] , this may occur due to inhibition of PKB / Akt or PDK - 1 [ 479 ] . Celecoxib can also activate apoptosis by the intrinsic pathway , i . e . cytochrome C release by mitochondria activating caspases - 3 , 8 , and 9 [ 480 , 481 ] . NSAIDs have also shown anti - tumour effects on COX2 - null cell lines as NSAIDs independently of COX2 inhibition can stimulate the transcription and translation of 15 - hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase ( 15 - PGDH ) which degrades inflammatory prostaglandins so physiologically antagonises COX2 . 15 - PGDH may inhibit colon malignancy [ 482 ] . NSAIDs may raise levels of 15 - PGDH by ( i ) down - regulation of matrix metalloproteinase - 9 ( MMP - 9 ) which can degrade 15 - PGDH 41 and ( ii ) by upregulating Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase - 1 ( TIMP - 1 ) an inhibitor of MMP - 9 [ 483 ] . Ibuprofen is reported to upregulate metalloprotease - 13 ( MMP - 13 ) and Paracetamol to suppress it [ 484 ] . Ibuprofen may also down regulate MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 [ 485 ] , as well as TNFα stimulated IL - 6 and IL - 8 [ 486 ] . Finally NSAIDs’ purported anti - cancer effects include inhibition of calcium ATPases preventing cytosolic calcium re - uptake and so elevating intracellular calcium concentrations [ 487 ] . 1 . 23 : Research objectives Malignant cell migration facilitates metastasis , frequently the final fatal stage in cancer progression . Interest is growing in modulation of chemokine signalling as a therapeutic tool in cancer . For example , a CXCR4 peptide antagonist ( LY2510924 ) has been used in clinical trials as adjunct therapy , with a variety of established chemotherapeutic agents , but as yet there have been no positive outcomes reported . Sadly LY2510924 reduced overall survival ( OS ) time in metastatic renal cell carcinoma from 12 to 8 months when added to Sunitinib [ 488 ] ; and reduced OS time from 11 to 9 months in small cell lung cancer when added to carboplatin and etoposide therapy [ 489 ] . These results confirm further elucidation and understanding of chemokine signalling is urgently required . Hypothesis : Many chemokines , including CCL3 and CXCL12 along with their cognate receptors , are instrumental in supporting metastasis . Aim : Elucidate the importance of key intracellular signalling proteins in CCL3 - and CXCL12 - triggered cancer cell migration . Objective : To use small molecule antagonism , siRNA knockdown or plasmid modification of chemokine receptors and important intracellular signalling proteins to further elucidate these proteins role in chemokine - induced cell migration in vitro , as this may relate to metastasis in vivo . The focus was on CXCL12 - , CCL3 - and CCL2 - induced chemotaxis in THP - 1 monocyte , and Jurkat T - cell suspension cell - lines also CXCL12 - and CCL3 - stimulated random motility ( chemokinesis ) in MCF7 a breast - cancer adherent cell - line . Limitations : The investigations in this thesis solely used cancer cell - lines to understand the fundamentals of these specific chemokine signalling pathways , the identities of the cell - lines were presumed to be as supplied from ATCC . Cell - lines offer easy access and excellent reproducibility as a first step before expanding into patient samples or animal models both of which also have 42 their limitations . Malignant cells are unique to each and every patient so tissue samples must be drawn from many different patients to get a clear picture of inhibitor effects . Animal models , usually mice , are also very useful , more homogeneous ; however the important differences in the chemokine systems of mice and men are a limiting factor . Cell - lines can establish the importance of a signalling protein in chemotactic signalling laying the groundwork for further investigations in animal models and patient samples which precede clinical trials in people . For example this was the route that has led to the now extensive clinical use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the treatment of many cancers [ 490 ] . 43 Chapter 2 : Materials and Methodology 2 . 1 : Reagents 2 . 1 . 1 : Small Molecule Inhibitors Table 2 . 1 : Small Molecule Inhibitors ( solvent DMSO unless otherwise stated ) Small molecule Inhibitor Supplier Experimental conc .

Suspension cells were maintained in RPMI complete at approximately 80 x 10 4 cells / mL 2 . 3 . 3 : Cell Counting and Viability 0 . 1 mL of 0 . 4 % Tryptan Blue in PBS was added to 0 . 1 mL of cell suspension , incubated for 15 minutes , and the mixture used to load Neubauer haemocytometer . Blue cells were non - viable . Cells were counted using light microscopy , at X400 . Viability was calculated as % viable = [ 1 - ( blue cells / total cells ) ] x 100 . Cells were only used if viability was above 95 % . 2 . 3 . 4 : Freezing and thawing cells Freezing : 5 x 10 6 cells in logarithmic growth phase were aseptically centrifuged ( 900 rpm / 5 minutes ) , the supernatant was discard , then cell pellet re - suspend in 1 mL freezing mixture ( sterile FCS + 10 % sterile DMSO ) , transferred to 2 cryogenic tubes ( Fisher ) , wrapped in several layers of tissue to slow freezing rate and immediately place at - 70°C for ≥ 24 hours , once fully frozen tubes were transferred to liquid nitrogen storage ( - 195°C ) . Thawing : A cryogenic tube was warmed rapidly to 37°C , once contents were freely moving they were aseptically tipped into 5 mL simple medium ( 37°C ) , shaken gently , centrifuged ( 900 rpm , 5 minutes ) , the supernatant discard , and pellet re - suspended in 5 mL warmed complete medium maintain at 37°C 5 % CO 2 . 2 . 3 . 5 : Harvesting Adherent Cells Concentrated EDTA solution ( 0 . 5 M ) was prepared by weighing 37 . 224 g EDTA , adding to 100mL of Millipore filtered distilled water , then placing on a magnetic stirrer in plastic beaker , 6 - 10 pellets of sodium hydroxide added , and stirred until all solids were in solution . The pH was adjusted if necessary with HCl 5 M to give pH 7 - 8 , solution was transferred to a 200 mL glass bottle and autoclaved , 121°C , 15 minutes . 2mL of this sterile 0 . 5 M EDTA was then added aseptically to 200 mL of sterile PBS to prepare working ~ 5 mM EDTA . Adherent cells were detached by pouring off medium , adding 4 mL of 5 mM EDTA / PBS , incubating ( 37°C , 5 % CO 2 , 10 minutes ) , the flask tapped until cells detached , cells were then centrifuged and washed with PBS ( 37°C ) to remove EDTA . Harvesting using Trypsin / 0 . 05 % EDTA ( Gibco - invitrogen ) : Medium was tipped out from 75 cm 2 flasks , and attached cells rinsed with PBS , before adding 2 . 5 mL Trypsin / 0 . 05 % EDTA solution , 51 flasks were then left for 10 seconds , before 1 . 5 mL of Trypsin / 0 . 05 % EDTA was removed leaving 1 mL on cells , flasks were then briefly incubated ( 2 minutes , 37°C , 5 % CO 2 ) , and flask tapped until cells detached . Cells were used without further rinsing as the new medium dilutes remaining trypsin / EDTA enough so it does not impede attachment or growth . 2 . 3 . 6 : Phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate differentiation of THP - 1 to macrophages THP - 1 were centrifuged , re - suspended at 20 x 10 4 cells / mL in fresh RPMI complete , and 25 - 50 ng / mL Phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA , TPA ) added , e . g . 1 . 5 μL per 30 - 60 mL cell suspension . For cell staining 5 mL of cell suspension was added to each well of 6 well plate containing glass coverslips previously sterilised in ethanol 70 % , plates were left 72 hours for cells to adhere and grow on coverslips . 2 . 4 : Chemotaxis The wells in a Neuro Probe ChemoTx® System micro - chemotaxis plate ( ChemoTx # 101 - 5 with 5 μm pores ) were blocked with 30 µL blocking buffer ( 1 % BSA in RPMI without additives ) for at least 30 minutes at room temperature . Chemokine solutions were prepared at working concentration / s , 1 nM unless otherwise stated , in working buffer ( 0 . 1 % BSA in RPMI without additives ) . Jurkat or THP - 1 cells were spun at 900 rpm and re - suspended in working buffer to give 25 x 10 4 cells per well . Inhibitors at the required concentrations were added and cells incubated ( 37°C 30 minutes ) . Blocking buffer was removed from the plate and replaced with 31 µL of the relevant chemokine solution or working buffer for the control . The membrane was attached and 20 µL of cell suspension was added to the top surface . The plate was placed in a humidified chamber which was then incubated for 4 hours at 37°C , 5 % CO 2 . Next the remaining cell solution on membrane was carefully removed , the membrane detached , and the cells that had migrated through the pores into in each well counted using a haemocytometer . Each data point was performed in duplicate , and the whole experiment repeated on three or more occasions . 2 . 5 : Wound - healing assays MCF7 cells were removed from flasks using EDTA 0 . 5 mM / PBS , centrifuged , ( transfected if required ) , seeded onto 12 well plates , incubated ( 37°C , 5 % CO 2 ) for 24 hours . A scratch was introduced to the monolayer with 200 µL pipette tips ( time point 0 ) , medium and loose cells removed , monolayer washed once in DMEM , then 500 μL DMEM without additives was added along with inhibitors or vehicle control and plates incubated ( 37°C , 5 % CO 2 30 minutes ) . Chemokines ( at 10 nM unless otherwise stated ) were added to the cells and pictures were taken ( time point 0 ) . Plates were incubated ( 37°C , 5 % CO 2 24 hours ) then imaging repeated ( time point 52 24 hours ) , using an inverted Leica microscope 10 times magnification . Images were analysed and the width of the wound was measured for control and with inhibitor treatment ( with and without chemokine ) at 0 hours and 24 hours . Ratios were calculated ( width of the wound after 24 hours divided by the width of the wound at 0 hours ) and the effects of inhibitor and chemokine analysed . The nearer the result is to 1 the more effective the inhibitor in preventing migration . 2 . 6 : Cytotoxicity Assays 2 . 6 . 1 : CellTitre 96® Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay 3 - ( 4 , 5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 5 - ( 3 - carboxymethoxyphenyl ) - 2 - ( 4 - sulfophenyl ) - 2H - tetrazolium ( MTS ) assays were performed using Promega’s CellTiter 96® Aqueous Non - Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay and 96 well plates . Suspension cells were spun down , and re - suspended in RPMI complete at 1 x 10 6 cells / mL , 100 uL of cell solution was placed in each well . ( For adherent cells these were seeded into the plate and incubated ( 37°C , 5 % CO 2 ) in complete medium overnight to form a monolayer , medium was then pipetted out and 100 μL of complete medium per well added ) . Then for both adherent and suspension cells inhibitors were added at the required concentrations . Each condition / inhibitor was duplicated . Plates were incubated for 4 hours at 37°C before 20 μL of the MTS solution was added per well and the plate incubated for 2 - 5 hours at 37°C . The MTS is reduced by live cells to a red / brown soluble formazan that absorbs at 490 nM . Once sufficiently coloured the plate was read in a BMG Labtech Fluostar OPTIMA fluorometer at 490 nm . 2 . 6 . 2 : Manual Toxicity Assay Inhibitors that are chromophores that absorb light at 490 nm can give erroneous results with any absorbance tests . The inhibitor β - ARK - 1 was a good example . At 190 μM β - ARK - 1 no toxicity is detected by MTS assays , yet β - ARK - 1 IC 50 , depending on cell type , was nearer 10 μM . Manual toxicity assay were undertaken as above ( 2 . 6 . 1 ) except MTS was not used instead cells are counted manually after required incubation time with inhibitors . 20 μL of cell suspension was added to 20 μL of Trypan blue 0 . 4 % filtered solution , mixed , incubated ( 37°C , 5 % CO 2 , 15 minutes ) , then loaded into a haemocytometer and any live cells counted manually . Dead cells stained completely blue , live cells stayed clear . 2 . 7 : Fluorescent Phallotoxin ( Phalloidin ) F - actin Stain Twelve well plates were prepared aseptically , each well with one glass cover slip dipped in 70 % ethanol . Adherent cells were detached using 0 . 5mM EDTA / PBS , and sparsely seeded into wells , 500 μL complete medium was added to each well and plate incubated overnight to allow cell 53 attachment and growth on glass coverslips . Complete medium was then removed aseptically and 500μL of medium without additives placed in each well . Inhibitors were added in duplicates and plate incubated ( 37°C , 5 % CO 2 , 30 minutes ) . Chemokines were then added to one of each duplicate and plate incubated for a further hour . Solutions were then removed , coverslips gently washed with cold PBS , and 100 μL 4 % paraformaldehyde added , and plate left at room temperature for 10 - 15 minutes . Paraformaldehyde was then removed , coverslips gently washed with cold PBS and 100 μL of 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 added for 3 - 5 minutes . Triton X - 100 was then removed , coverslips washed with cold PBS , and 50μL per well of Phalloidin Daylight TM 488 Conjugated ( 1 μL per 100 μL cold PBS ) added . Plate was covered to exclude light and kept at room temperature for 20 minutes . Phalloidin solution was pipetted off , coverslips were washed once with cold PBS , then if required DAPI staining was undertaken next ( see methodology below ) . Finally coverslips were lifted from wells and mounted face down on a labelled glass slide / s using a spot of DPX mounting medium or PBS / glycerol 50 / 50 mix and nail varnish to seal edges of coverslip onto glass slide . 2 . 8 : 4’ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) stain This can be used after actin or receptor staining , where cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and permeabilised with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . 1 μL of DAPI was diluted in 1 mL PBS ( 300 nM ) and 50 μL placed on coverslip in well , plate incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes in dark , DAPI solution removed and wells rinsed three times cold PBS , coverslips were mounted on glass slides as above . 2 . 9 : Receptor Immunofluorescence staining For suspension cells , cells were centrifuged , washed 1 x cold PBS , re - suspended at 5 x 10 6 cells / mL in cold 0 . 5 % BSA in PBS , and primary antibody ( 1 : 1000 ) in 0 . 5 % BSA in PBS added or control ( 0 . 5 % BSA in PBS ) . Cells were incubated ( 4°C , 1 hour ) washed twice in cold 0 . 5 % BSA in PBS , before re - suspended in fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) labelled immunoglobulin secondary antibodies ( 1 : 100 in 0 . 5 % BSA in PBS ) for 1 h at 4°C . Cells were then washed twice ( 0 . 5 % BSA in PBS ) and a droplet placed onto a labelled glass slide and a coverslip added before imaging using an inverted Leica DMII fluorescence microscope magnification 500X – 1000X UV excitation 435 nM emission 480 nM . For adherent cells , cells were seeded , as in Phalloidin actin stain above , onto glass coverslips in 12 well plates , incubated overnight ( 37°C , 5 % CO 2 ) on coverslips , washed with 0 . 5 % BSA / PBS , then stains and washes were added to wells as described above , and coverslips mounted as in Phalloidin actin stain . 54 2 . 10 : Immunofluorescence staining of cellular proteins Twelve well plates were prepared aseptically , each well with one glass cover slip dipped in 70 % ethanol . Adherent cells were detached using 0 . 5 mM EDTA / PBS , and sparsely seeded into wells , 500 μL complete medium was added to each well and plate incubated overnight to allow cell attachment and growth on glass coverslips . Solutions were then removed , coverslips gently washed with cold PBS , and 100 μL 4 % paraformaldehyde added , and plate left at room temperature for 10 - 15 minutes . Paraformaldehyde was then removed , coverslips gently washed with cold PBS and 100 μL of 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 added for 3 - 5 minutes . Triton X - 100 was removed , coverslips washed 3x with cold PBS . Cells were incubated in 1 % BSA in PBS + 1 % Tween 20 ( PBST ) for 30 minutes ( blocks non - specific binding ) . Then incubated in desired antibody ( 1 : 1000 ) in 1 % PBST in humidified chamber 1 hour RT , before antibody was removed , washed 3x with cold PBS for 5 minutes , secondary antibody ( 1 : 1000 ) in 1 % BSA in PBST added , and plate kept 1 hour RT ( in dark ) . Secondary antibody was then pipetted off , coverslips washed with cold PBS ( 3x 5 minutes ) , then mounted with drop of DPX , and stored at 4°C in dark , imaged using an inverted Leica DMII fluorescence microscope magnification 500X – 1000X UV excitation 435 nM emission 480 nM . 2 . 11 : Transfection of cells 2 . 11 . 1 : siRNA Transfection 2 . 11 . 1 . 1 : siRNA transfection using AMAXA Nucleofector siRNA was prepared by adding 200 uL of RNAse free siRNA suspension buffer ( Qiagen Sciences ) to 5 nmol of siRNA to produce 25 μM ( approximate ) stock , tube was centrifuged briefly and placed on the orbital shaker ( 30 minutes , RT ) . 2 μL of 25 μM siRNA stock was added to 198 μL RNAse free suspension buffer to produce approximate 250 nM stock . Solution concentration was confirmed using Nanodrop readings on the RNA / DNA tab . The average of three RNA readings was used and concentration calculated using formula 13 . 4 ng / μL = 1 μM - formula uses average siRNA mol . wt . = 13 , 400 g / mol ( Dharmacon , UK ) .

This requires the recruitment of several cytosolic proteins including the ~ 98 kDa GTPase dynamin . Dynamin is purported to aid the scission of vesicles from the membrane by forming helical oligomers around the necks of budding vesicles , before GTP hydrolysis creates conformational change in the dynamin polymer producing vesicle / membrane fission . However this is not dynamin’s only role in cellular function [ 163 , 164 ] , dynamins are also involved in cytokinesis , organelle division , pathogen resistance and transport vesicle budding [ 165 ] . Dynamin other important cellular functions including roles in signalling and the endocytosis of receptors [ 164 , 497 ] . There are many dynamin splice variants and 3 key isoforms , Dynamin - 1 , - 2 and - 3 . Dynamin - 2 is ubiquitous [ 166 - 168 ] . The closely related Dynamin - like proteins ( DLP ) include Dynamin - related - protein one ( Drp - 1 ) , mitofusin ( Mfn ) , and Optic Atrophy protein 1 ( OPA1 ) involved in the mitochondrial fission and fusion essential for cell division [ 170 , 498 ] . The dynamin protein contains five regions including a Pleckstrin homology ( PH ) and GTPase domains . Dynamin monomers form dimers which can then oligomerise to produce constricting rings round endosomal vesicles containing receptors which cause vesicle scission [ 165 , 497 ] . Dynamin - 1 , - 2 and - 3 have differing abilities to curve membranes to produce endosome fission [ 177 - 179 ] . The pathways and fates of endocytic vesicles can qualitatively and quantitatively control downstream signalling and cellular responses that mediate cancer prognosis and metastasis . Endosome cargo such as specific GPCRs can influence sorting decisions between recycling to cell surface and ubiquitination and degradation [ 193 - 195 ] . Endosomes can also contain signalling platforms such as GPCR / β - arrestin complexes that can trigger signalling favouring malignancy [ 196 , 198 , 199 ] . Endocytosis can be clathrin - dependent or independent ; dynamin plays a role in both [ 189 ] . Dynamin may rate - limit the former and , along with EndophilinA and F - actin , facilitate vesicle scission in the later , along with signalling through Pi3K , Rho and Rac [ 221 - 224 ] . Aberrant function of dynamin and DLPs such as Drp - 1 are implicated in metastasis [ 226 ] . Dynamin - 2 interactions with oncogenes expressed in many cancers can activate CXCL12 signalling through Akt , JAK and Rac1 favourable to metastasis [ 229 - 234 ] . Drp - 1 drives mitosis in many cancers . Drp - 1 , OPA - 1 and Mfn modulate mitochondrial fission and fusion in cell division . Drp - 1 inhibition can increase malignant cell apoptosis and decrease cell proliferation [ 235 , 236 ] . Thus dynamin plays 65 importance roles both in homeostasis and malignancies . What is less well understood is dynamins role in metastasis supported by chemokines . This work explored the role of dynamin in malignant cell migration through chemotaxis assays in THP - 1 monocytes and Jurkat T - cells , along with wound - healing assays of chemokinesis in MCF7 breast cancer cells . Hypothesis : Dynamin supports chemotactic migration of cancer cells ; therefore inhibition of dynamin may prevent metastasis . Aim : To expose the role of dynamin in CCL3 and CXCL12 - chemotactic migration in cancer cell - lines THP - 1 and Jurkat along with dynamins role in CCL3 and CXCL12 supported wound - healing in MCF7 . Objectives : ( i ) Establish the presence of CCR5 and CXCR4 in cell - lines . ( ii ) Establish that dynamin is expressed in THP - 1 , Jurkat and MCF7 . ( iii ) Explore the effects of siRNA knockdown of dynamin in THP - 1 , Jurkat and MCF7 . ( iv ) Observe the effects of a range of small molecule inhibitors of dynamin on chemotaxis in Jurkat and THP - 1 looking for any chemokine and / or dynamin domain - specific effects . 3 . 2 : Results Please note controls are common between graphs where experiments were conducted simultaneously ; results for each inhibitor have been displayed separately for ease of description of results , this applies to : figures 3 . 8 and 3 . 15 ; 3 . 16 and 3 . 19 ; 3 . 23 and 3 . 24 . 3 . 2 . 1 : The expression of CXCR4 and CCR5 in cell - lines First the expression of CXCR4 in THP1 , Jurkat and MCF7 was examined by flow cytometry , levels appeared highest in Jurkat , figure 3 . 1 . 66 A THP - 1 B Jurkat C MCF7 CXCR4 CXCR4 CXCR4 Figure 3 . 1 : CXCR4 expression in ( A ) THP - 1 , ( B ) Jurkat and ( C ) MCF7 .

CCL3 may illicit responses through binding CCR1 or CCR5 . Inhibition of CCR1 using J113863 , or CCR5 using Maraviroc both significantly inhibit chemotaxis of THP - 1 to CCL3 , suggesting both receptors were expressed by THP - 1 , and relevant to CCL3 - induced chemotaxis , figure 3 . 4 .

Dynamin - 2 siRNA almost complete knockdown did not significantly affect chemotaxis of THP - 1 to CCL3 or Jurkat chemotaxis to CXCL12 . Knockdown was very effective in THP - 1 but less so in Jurkat where dynamin knockdown may have been partial in all cells or complete in a proportion of Jurkat hence a more effective knockdown in Jurkat may have produced a very different result . However effective Dynamin - 2 knockdown did significantly inhibited wound - healing in MCF7 cells , possibly indicating a differential use of Dynamin - 2 in adherent and suspension cell - lines , figure 3 . 7 .

CCL3 chemotaxis in THP - 1 was not significantly inhibited however in MCF7 CCL3 ( and CXCL12 ) wound - healing was dramatically reduced . The assays differ in that cell movement in wound - healing is non - directional whereas in chemotaxis it is ; suggesting either that there may be a differential use of dynamin - 2 in these cell lines or that dynamin - 2 is important for other factors CCL3 - - + + Dynamin siRNA - + - + Scrambled siRNA + - + - 0 hours 24 hours CXCL12 - - + + Dynamin siRNA - + - + Scrambled siRNA + - + - 0 hours 24 hours MCF7 Scratch Assay Dynamin siRNA CXCL12 10nM , CCL3 10 nM n  3 20 . 03 . 16 S c r c on t r o l D y n a m i n c on t r o l S c r s i R N A + C C L 3 D y n s i R N A + C C L 3 S c r s i R N A + C X C L 12 D y n s i R N A + C X C L 12 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 * * * * * * w ound w i d t h 24 h r / 0 h r A B 71 involved in wound - healing . Such factors may involve haptokinetic ( random ) migration , or haptotaxis migration along a substrate [ 500 ] , In vivo substrate may be the extracellular matrix , to which chemokine gradient may be bound . In vitro the plastic substrate of a wound - healing assay may absorb chemokine , but gradients are absent , hence chemotaxis which involves a cell extending a leading edge towards and then moving up a diffusing chemokine gradient does not occur , but chemokinesis random migration prompted by a chemokine can . To further analyse the effects of dynamin in chemotaxis a range of small molecule inhibitors were employed in THP - 1 and Jurkat chemotaxis assays . Inhibitors were chosen with structural similarities such as MitMAB with OcTMAB , and Dynasore with Dyngo4a , along with inhibitors with unique structures , such as RTIL - 13 , table 3 . 1 . This range of inhibitors will block either dynamin recruitment at the plasma membrane ( MiTMAB , OcTMAB or RTIL - 13 ) or inhibit dynamins functions once at the membrane ( Dynasore , Dyngo4a ) [ 501 ] . With these tools it was hoped to fully probe the functions of dynamin in chemotaxis to CCL3 and CXCL12 . 3 . 2 . 5 : Dynamin and Drp - 1 inhibitors Dynamin inhibitors are anti - mitotic and so potential anti - cancer drugs . The dynamin inhibitors used here include ( i ) the first dynamin inhibitor synthesised , Dynasore , a cell - permeable reversible non - competitive inhibitor of the dynamin GTPase and at lower concentrations Drp - 1 [ 499 ] . ( ii ) A Dynasore analogue with purportedly greater specificity and potency and less cytotoxicity , Dyngo4a [ 502 ] . ( iii ) The long - chain ammonium salt inhibitors MiTMAB and OcTMAB which target the PH domain of dynamin [ 503 ] . ( iv ) Room Temperature Ionic Liquid 13 ( RTIL - 13 ) which targets both dynamins PH and GTPase domains . ( v ) RhodadynC10 a Rhodanine N - ethyl analogue with a potency at least as good as other in - cell dynamin inhibitors [ 504 ] , which targets dynamin’s GTPase domain and Transferin - A , and ( vi ) Pyrimidyn7 , one of the most potent dynamin inhibitors available which inhibits dynamin - 1 interactions with both GTP and phospholipid [ 505 , 506 ] . Table 3 . 1 illustrates the site / s of action of dynamin inhibitors used in this investigation . 72 Table 3 . 1 : Small molecule inhibitors of dynamin , their structures , target region / s and reported IC 50 ‘s [ 499 , 502 - 506 ] .

Actin filament remodelling enables cell motility and metastatic invasion of tissues . Dynasore inhibits actin dynamic remodelling and malignant cell invasion [ 508 ] . Dynasore has reported relatively low potency and specificity , compared to Dyngo4a , [ 501 ] hence Dynasore has been used at 100 μM in cell assays by others [ 509 ] however MTS assays illustrated at 80 μM Dynasore caused cytotoxicity in THP - 1 cells but not in Jurkat . At 60 μM or below this toxicity was lost , figure 3 . 8 . 73 Jurkat THP - 1 MCF7 A B C Figure 3 . 8 : Cytotoxicity assays for Dynasore . MTS assays were over 7 hours in ( A ) Jurkat and ( B ) THP - 1 and over 24 hours in ( C ) MCF7 cells . Basal absorbance occurs in presence of medium after MTS treatment in the absence of cells . Means ± SEM , one - way ANOVA , post - hoc Bonferroni , n≥3 independent experiments , * * = p < 0 . 01 , ns = p > 0 . 05 . Dynasore contains a chromophore explaining the increased absorbance seen at 80 μM in Jurkat , figure 3 . 8A , this is likely to have also have affected MTS results in THP - 1 and MCF7 , possibly disguising Dynasore toxicity at lower concentrations . Dynasore was also found to cause cytoskeletal damage , adherent cells were seen to develop membrane ruffles , neural - like projections and have a tendency to detach from surfaces , leading to less cell density on the slides , figure 3 . 9B ( control and treated slides were seeded at the same density ) . This is expected as dynamin mechanistically interacts with myosin and actin . Others have observed these effects with Dynasore at 80 μM [ 510 ] , figure 3 . 9 .

The effect of Dynasore on CXCL12 and CCL3 - induced chemotaxis in Jurkat and THP - 1 cells was explored using different inhibitor concentrations . At 80 μM , figure 3 . 10 , probably due to toxicity cytotoxicity suggested by the MTS assays , figure 3 . 8B , Dynasore produced significant inhibition of chemotaxis in THP - 1 ( p < 0 . 001 ) , as well as non - significantly reducing basal migration , figure 3 . 10C . Hence using Dynasore at 80 μM in THP - 1 does not inform on dynamin function in THP - 1 chemotaxis .

Dynasore is also reported to dynamin - independently disrupt lipid rafts and membrane cholesterol homeostasis [ 511 ] . Dynasore application at 80 μM has been shown to inhibit dynamin - dependent endocytic pathways rapidly stopping coated vesicle formation causing the accumulation of partly formed pits and arresting the pinching off of vesicles [ 512 ] , suggesting dynamin is essential in coated vesicle formation and endocytic vesicle scission . However , Dynasore and another dynamin , G - domain inhibitor Dyngo - 4a , have been shown to produce off - target effects . In cells where dynamin isoforms 1 , 2 , and 3 were knocked out , Dynasore at 80 μM and Dyngo - 4a at 30 μM both still inhibited membrane ruffles , cell attachment and spreading , as well as inhibiting F - actin and lamellipodia formation [ 513 ] . Dynasore at 75 μM is also reported to increase calcium levels at the membrane [ 514 ] . The effects of Dynasore on CCL3 and CXCL12 - induced calcium release were explored ; the results did not mimic those from the chemotaxis , figure 3 . 13 . MCF7 CHO .

CCR5 , figure 3 . 13 , again indicating cell - specific responses to dynamin inhibition or Dynasore toxicity . 3 . 2 . 7 : Dyngo4a Dyngo4a is a Dynasore analogue , table 3 . 1 , with reportedly 40 - fold improved potency over Dynasore and more specificity as explained above [ 501 ] . It has reported IC 50 values of 380 nM and 2 . 6 μM at dynamin - 1 and - 2 respectively compared to Dynasore IC 50 of 15 μM . Both Dyngo4a and Dynasore target the GTPase activity of dynamin - 1 and dynamin - 2 [ 515 ] . Membrane - permeable Dyngo4a , like Dynasore , inhibits dynamin by binding to an allosteric site within the GTPase domain of both dynamin - 1 and - 2 [ 516 ] , and both inhibitors block dynamin function after membrane recruitment [ 501 ] . However here Dyngo4a was only found to inhibit chemotaxis to CXCL12 and CCL3 at concentrations of 80 μM , figure 3 . 14 , but not to have any significant effects on chemotaxis at lower concentrations ( data not shown ) . Suggesting Dyngo4a’s reported increased potency over Dynasore is not applicable to chemotaxis of THP - 1 or Jurkat . MTS assays showed that Dyngo4a’s observed effects were not due to toxicity , figure 3 . 15 .

Means ± SEM , n≥3 independent experiments , one - way ANOVA with post - hoc Bonferroni revealed no significant differences . The results of the chemotaxis and cytotoxicity assays for Dyngo4a indicate its reported 40 - fold increased potency over Dynasore with respect to dynamin either does not apply in THP - 1 or Jurkat or that Dyngo4a does indeed target dynamin more effectively than Dynasore , blocking both endocytosis and clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 501 ] , with less off target toxicity than Dynasore . Suggesting the above Dynasore results could be due more to off target toxicity than dynamin inhibition , as the chemokine specific response produced by 40 μM Dynasore was not repeated by Dyngo4a . 3 . 2 . 8 : MiTMAB and OcTMAB Next the effects of MiTMAB and OcTMAB , inhibitors of dynamins PH domain were explored . MiTMAB and OcTMAB are water - soluble , cell - permeable and block cytokinesis without any other effects on mitosis and also induce apoptosis in cancer cells [ 517 ] . Their toxicity in cancer cells is higher than in healthy cells . Classical anti - mitotics such as taxanes and vinca alkaloids target microtubules , but tubulin is important for function of healthy and non - dividing cells [ 518 ] . Other anti - mitotics target kinases and kinesin spindle proteins expressed in dividing cells , and so also target the mitotic spindle early in cell division [ 519 ] . Targeting dynamin does not target the mitotic spindle ; blocking dynamin prevents the necessary dynamin activation of phosphatase calcineurin to produce cytokinesis . Hence MiTMAB and OcTMAB block the abscission phase of cytokinesis producing polyploidy without affecting any other stage of mitosis and they are selective for cancer cells [ 520 , 521 ] . Apoptotic death may not follow cytokinesis failure , senescence and reversible mitotic arrest may occur [ 522 ] . In cancer cells responses to MiTMAB and OcTMAB negatively correlate with levels of Bcl - 2 and Mcl - 1 , another Bcl - 2 protein family member . MiTMAB / OcTMAB - induced apoptosis is caspase - dependent . If cell - lines express Bcl - 2 , an anti - apoptotic protein , they are resistant to MiTMAB and OctMAB [ 517 ] .

MiTMAB inhibits dynamin - 1 and - 2 with an IC 50 of 3 . 1 μM and 8 . 4 μM respectively competing with the lipid - binding pleckstrin homology but not the GTPase . IC 50 for inhibiting dynamin - 1 and - 2 receptor - mediated endocytosis is 19 . 9 μM and 2 . 2 μM respectively [ 503 , 520 ] . 3 . 2 . 8 . 1 : MitMAB MitMAB targets the dynamin - phospholipid interactions , may interact with phospholipase - Cδ PH domain , and has been shown to block calcium influx [ 524 ] , hence may inhibit endocytosis through an effect on calcium channels [ 525 ] . Cytosolic calcium changes support a shift from early to late endocytosis [ 526 , 527 ] . MitMAB has also been shown to inhibit nicotinic acetylcholine receptors [ 523 ] . In cancer cells MitMAB can block dynamin - 2 , as it inhibits cytokinesis and cell proliferation but not any other cell - cycle stage [ 520 ] . MTS assays indicated cytotoxicity at 10 μM in THP - 1 and Jurkat , figure 3 . 16 . MiTMAB at 10 μM had no effect on calcium release ( data not shown ) .

Therefore further investigations probed differences in effects between CCL3 and CXCL12 chemotaxis in THP - 1 as such differences in response were not found in the literature . Dynasore and MitMAB have been shown to produce temporally distinct effects . Dynasore but not MitMAB block dynamin - 1 GTPase activity , and so may block the early stages of endocytosis when receptor stimulus is still present , whereas MitMAB , a competitive inhibitor , may block dynamin binding to phospholipid membranes later in the endocytosis process [ 523 ] . Suggesting the endocytosis kinetic differences in CXCR4 / CXCL12 and CCL3 / CCR5 could explain results , see discussion . 3 . 2 . 8 . 2 : OcTMAB OcTMAB , like MiTMAB , is an inhibitor of dynamin - 1 and - 2 , IC 50 is approximately 1 . 9 μM , and 4 . 4 μM respectively , about half that of MiTMAB . OcTMAB IC 50 for inhibiting receptor - mediated endocytosis is approximately 6 . 7 μM OcTMAB also completes for phospholipids for the lipid binding pleckstrin homology of dynamins IC 50 ~ 16 μM all values depend on cell type [ 501 ] . OcTMAB modestly inhibited chemotaxis to CXCL12 in Jurkat and THP - 1 , but not to CCL3 in THP - 1 , figure 3 . 18 . OcTMAB at 5 μM had no effect on calcium release ( data not shown ) and displayed no toxicity in MTS assays , figure 3 . 19 .

Thus MiTMAB and OcTMAB , both reported as inhibitors of dynamins PH domain , at the concentrations employed selectively inhibited CXCL12 but not CCL3 chemotaxis . Next the effects of Rhodadyn - C 10 , purportedly an inhibitor of Dynamins GTPase domain [ 504 ] were explored . 3 . 2 . 9 : Rhodadyn - C10™ Rhodadyn - C10 is the N - ethyl analogue of a rhodanine scaffold . It is cell - permeable and inhibits dynamin - 1 and - 2 GTPase activity IC 50 values are reported as 6 . 4 μM and 30 . 3 μM at dynamin - 1 and dynamin - 2 respectively . Rhodadyn - C10 also blocks clathrin - mediated endocytosis of transferrin and receptor - mediated endocytosis with an IC 50 of 7 . 0 μM [ 504 ] . Rhodadyn - C10 at 20 μM did significantly inhibit CXCL12 chemotaxis of Jurkat , and to a much lesser extent CCL3 chemotaxis in THP - 1 but MTS assays indicated significant toxicity over seven hours in both cell lines , figure 3 . 20 . At concentrations of 20 μM Rhodadyn - C10 had no effect on calcium release and at concentrations below 20 μM Rhodadyn - C10 had no effect on chemotaxis .

Results with Rhodadyn - C10 did not support the theory that the G - domain is more applicable to CCL3 - than CXCL12 - chemotaxis , however its cytotoxicity limited its usefulness . Next the effects of two dynamin inhibitors credited with inhibiting both dynamins G - and PH - domains , RTIL - 13 and Pyrimidyn - 7 TM were examined . 3 . 2 . 10 : RTIL - 13 Room Temperature Ionic Liquids ( RTILs ) are salts with high melting points ( > 150°C ) used as replacements for volatile organic solvents in chemical synthesis as they produce faster , cleaner reactions , however predicting any individual RTIL’s properties is difficult . RTIL - 13 ( 4 - ( N , N - dimethyl - N - octadecyl - N - ethyl ) - 4 - aza - 10 - oxatricyclo [ 5 . 2 . 1 ] decane - 3 , 5 - dione bromide ) was developed as a tool to solubilise the PH domain of dynamin for protein experiments , and was found to inhibit dynamin GTPase with an IC 50 of 2 . 3 μM . Hence RTIL - 13 targets both dynamin’s lipid binding PH domain and its GTPase domain [ 528 ] . Abcam claim RTIL - 13 also inhibits receptor - mediated endocytosis ( IC 50 9 . 3 μM ) and synaptic vesicle endocytosis ( IC 50 7 . 1 μM ) . RTIL - 13 at concentrations between 5 and 20 μM inhibited chemotaxis of Jurkat and THP - 1 .

MTS assays indicated RTIL - 13 caused significant cytotoxicity at 10 μM and above in Jurkat and at 5 μM and above in THP - 1 . Thus although 20 μM RTIL - 13 significantly reduced cell migration figure 3 . 21A and B , cytotoxicity assays , figure 3 . 23 , and the significant inhibition of basal migration , figure 3 . 21B , indicated this may have been due to toxicity . Also Phalloidin stains in CHO . CCR5 following treatment with 20 μM RTIL - 13 illustrated that loss of actin filaments may have also contributed to reduced cell migration . Hence it is hard to isolate and effectively evaluate RTIL - 13’s effects on dynamin using chemotaxis assays . 3 . 2 . 11 : Pyrimidyn - 7 TM Pyrimidyn - 7 inhibits the binding of dynamin to phospholipid , by binding membrane phosphatidylserine . Phosphatidylserine binds the PH domain of dynamin and aids its GTPase activity by enhancing co - operative helix oligomerization [ 175 , 176 , 529 ] . Pyrimidyn - 7 shares structural similarities with ammonium salt inhibitors of dynamin , such as MiTMAB and some RTILs , and so has amphiphilic properties that inhibit dynamin - binding phospholipids . Also Pyrimidyn - 7 is a nucleotide analogue and so mimics GTP and targets the GTPase domain of dynamin competing with GTP for binding . Pyrimidyn - 7 targets dynamin - 1 ( IC 50 , 1 . 1 μM ) and dynamin - 2 ( IC 50 , 1 . 8 μM ) with nearly equal potency , competitively inhibiting both basal and phosphatidylserine - stimulated activity [ 506 ] . Pyrimidyn - 7 has been shown to reversibly inhibit vesicle endocytosis and clathrin - mediated endocytosis possibly because dynamin inhibition can inhibit endocytosis . Pyrimidyn - 7 at 30 - 40 μM can reversibly block clathrin - mediated endocytosis in cell lines . This is reversible after washout , and endocytosis activity is restored within an hour . At 30 μM Pyrimidyn - 7 is reported to abolish dynamin - PH binding and dynamin localisation to the membrane , and hence blocks clathrin - mediated endocytosis .

Inhibition of dynamin - 2’s role in cytokinesis , where it may stabilise the actin filaments in the contractile ring , [ 530 ] is one explanation . Here THP - 1 cells differentiated to macrophages were transfected with eGFP plasmids then treated with Dynasore 40 μM ; many of these cells showed defective cytokinesis , figure 3 . 26 . Similar effects were seen with THP - 1 treated RTIL - 13 20 μM or Dynasore 40 μM then stained with CCR5 antibody , figure 3 . 27 . Cytokinesis requires membrane ingression then abscission . Actin and myosin both form filaments in line with the mitotic spindle ; dynamin stabilises the actin filaments and hence plays a role in abscission [ 531 ] .

The results in the Jurkat provide some support for this conclusion although it cannot be confirmed as Jurkat do not migrate to CCL3 . This suggests that receptors CCR5 and / or CCR1 , the likely targets of CCL3 [ 532 ] , but not CXCR4 , the 86 likely target of CXCL12 , require an active dynamin G - domain for endocytosis . Others have found dynamin important in CC ( CCR2 ) chemokine - induced endocytosis [ 533 ] . 3 . 3 . 1 : Dynasore may be inhibiting Drp - 1 as well as dynamin Dynasore at low concentrations ( 1 - 10 μM ) inhibits mitochondrial Drp - 1 as well as dynamin - 1 and - 2 , hence at 40 μM it will produce significant inhibition of Drp - 1 . It is possible CCL3 - induced chemotaxis in THP - 1 is more sensitive to inhibition of Drp - 1 than Jurkat chemotaxis to CXCL12 . Increased Drp - 1 expression confers resistance to chemotherapy , e . g . in T - cell lymphoblastic leukaemia [ 534 ] , Drp - 1 can also increase disease virulence [ 252 ] by producing mitochondrial fragmentation which itself can accelerate mitosis and prevent homeostatic intra - mitochondrial calcium fluxes which can mediate apoptosis [ 242 ] . By inhibiting Drp - 1 for example with 1 , 3 and 10 μM Dynasore [ 535 ] proliferation can be inhibited and apoptosis supported . Whereas Dynasore at 80 μM has been shown to prevent receptor endocytosis [ 252 , 536 ] . Drp - 1 upregulation is found in many cancers [ 240 ] and Drp - 1 mutations can support hypoxia - induced migration in vitro in malignant glioblastoma cells [ 537 ] . MAPK / ERK pathway signalling leads to phosphorylation of Drp - 1 on Ser 616 [ 538 ] which can be suppressed by ERK inhibition . MAPK / ERK signalling is reportedly very active in Jurkat , and MAPK / ERK signalling also supports the phosphorylation of Drp - 1 Ser 616 , and so activation of Drp - 1 which modifies mitochondrial metabolism [ 534 ] . 3 . 3 . 2 : CCR5 and CXCR4 endocytosis kinetics There are important differences in the endocytosis kinetics and routes of the CCR5 and CXCR4 receptors which offers an alternative explanation of the different responses of CXCL12 - and CCL3 - induced chemotaxis to some dynamin inhibitors such as Dynasore . CXCL12 - bound CXCR4 receptors start to internalise within two minutes and bound receptor internalisation is complete within 20 minutes . A likely target of CCL3 are CCR5 receptors ; these have an extended conformation fatty acid saturated C - tail facilitating insertion into membrane lipid rafts , which slows internalisation by about 10 - fold compared to CXCR4 in T - cells . CCR5 internalises very slowly , it can take up to 40 minutes to get underway and two hours to complete . The longer transit time of the CCR5 may allow ligand release , receptor re - sensitisation , re - stimulation and further signalling . Also CXCR4 - internalisation can be clathrin - dependent , and CCR5 - clathrin - independent , as CCR5 may internalise via caveolae or glycolipid rafts [ 539 ] . These factors could explain the discordant effects of dynamin inhibition on CCL3 and CXCL12 - induced chemotaxis , if the CCR5 longer residency time on the membrane makes the receptor more sensitive to dynamin inhibitors such as Dynasore , figure 3 . 28 87 Figure 3 . 28A : Caveolae invaginations can recruit signalling receptors which may translocate between lipid rafts within and without caveolae while continuing to signal ; they may or may not undergo endocytosis [ 540 ] . CCR5 may signal via this mechanism [ 539 ] Figure 3 . 28B : Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is initiated when the ligand binds the receptor , clathrin is recurited for coating pit , F - actin and dynamin promote membrane curvature and dynamin neck scission endocytosis follows [ 541 ] . CXCR4 may be internalised by this method [ 539 ] Dynamin along with many other players such as Bin - Amphiphysin - RVS ( BAR ) proteins are key in both clathrin - coated pit formation and in vesicle neck strain and scission [ 542 ] . However there are many endocytic accessory proteins ( EAPs ) involved in clathrin and / or caveolin - mediated endocytosis . These can vary with cell type [ 543 ] and may be modified in cells with mutated DNA such as cancer cell - lines . EAPs include Adaptor proteins with basic motifs that bind negative PIP2 or phosphatidylserine [ 544 ] and so trigger clathrin - coated pit initiation . Knockdown of one of these Adaptor Protein Complexes , AP2 , inhibits clathrin - coated pit formation and to some extent receptor - internalisation [ 545 ] . This appears to be because stoichiometrically two AP2 complexes associate with PIP 2 and a clathrin triskelion to initiate clathrin - coated pit formation [ 546 ] . Therefore if any of the dynamin small molecule inhibitors used in this investigation have off - target effects on adaptor proteins that play a role in one but not both cell - lines employed this could also explain discordant effects of the inhibitor on one but not both Jurkat and THP - 1 chemotaxis . 3 . 4 : Conclusions Western Blot confirmed dynamin - 2 was present in Jurkat , THP - 1 and MCF7 , Immunofluorescence confirmed in THP - 1 and MCF7 the highest dynamin - 2 concentrations were in the nucleus . Knockdown of Dynamin - 2 very significantly inhibited wound - healing supported by CCL3 or CXCL12 in MCF7 , suggesting an important role for dynamin in chemokinesis . However even complete dynamin - 2 knockdown had no significant effect on CCL3 chemotaxis in THP - 1 . Dynamin siRNA investigations in Jurkat were somewhat inconclusive due to incomplete knockdown . Caveolin lipid raft Cholesterol & lipids Receptor translocation Chemokine Clathrin Dynamin F - actin 88 Dynamin was concluded to be important in cell division as inhibition , with RTIL - 13 or Dynasore , interrupted cytokinesis producing conjoined cells . Drawing conclusions from the results with Rhodadyn - C10 , RTIL - 13 and Pyrimidyn - 7 are hampered by these inhibitors toxicity at concentrations needed to inhibit chemotaxis . Pyrimidyn - 7 inhibits both the GTPase and PH domains of dynamin [ 506 ] . At 10 μM Pyrimidyn - 7 inhibited CXCL12 but not CCL3 chemotaxis , although it also inhibited cell metabolism in both THP - 1 and Jurkat . Pyrimidyn - 7’s differing effects on CXCL12 and CCL3 chemotaxis may be due to CXCR4 / CXCL12 but not CCR5 / CCL3 - induced signalling requiring rapid receptor endocytosis to produce signalling leading to chemotaxis . Dynasore targets dynamins GTPase domain [ 512 ] , at 40 μM it selectively inhibited CCL3 but not CXCL12 chemotaxis . As discussed this may be due to differing endocytosis kinetics and / or mechanisms of CXCR4 and CCR5 , or due to the G - domain being important for CXCL12 but not CCL3 chemotaxis . However as Dynasore at much lower concentrations inhibits Drp - 1 [ 499 ] therefore the effects of Dynasore at 40 μM on CCL3 assays could be partly due to inhibiting Drp - 1 modulated motility . This conclusion is supported by dynamin - 2 siRNA knockdown not significantly inhibiting chemotaxis in THP - 1 . Dyngo4a , which also purportedly inhibits dynamin GTPase domain , inhibited equally both CCL3 and CXCL12 chemotaxis so also did not confirm differential results from Dynasore . These contrasting effects of Dynasore and Dyngo4a were seen at inhibitor concentrations that did not cause toxicity . MiTMAB was seen to inhibit CXCL12 chemotaxis in THP - 1 and Jurkat but not CCL3 chemotaxis in THP - 1 , suggesting the PH domain may be more important for CXCL12 than CCL3 chemotaxis . Overall results demonstrate that dynamin is clearly present in these cell - lines and plays an important role in both CCL3 and CXCL12 chemokinesis in MCF7 . Results in THP - 1 and Jurkat suggest differential use of dynamin domains in CCL3 and CXCL12 stimulated chemotaxis . With the PH domain being more important for CXCL12 - chemotaxis and the GTPase domain for CCL3 - chemotaxis , figure 3 . 29 . However factors such as the role of Drp - 1 and the very different endocytosis kinetics between CCR5 in and CXCR4 receptors may have influenced these results . 89 Figure 3 . 29 : Different dynamin domains are involved in CCL3 - compared to CXCL12 - chemotaxis . In some cell types dynamin can support chemotaxis to both CCL3 and CXCL12 , however dynamins PH domain may be more important for chemotaxis to CXCL12 and dynamins GTPase domain for chemotaxis to CCL3 [ 547 ] . Dynamins diverse roles are only part of the chemokine signalling story leading to chemokinesis and chemotaxis supporting spread of cancer cells to secondary sites . Other key players in metastasis include PKC , Src , ROCK and the Raf / MEK / ERK signalling cascade ; investigations into these proteins are reported in chapter 4 .

PKC is an important chemokine signalling transducer in health and disease [ 548 , 549 ] . There are many PKC isoforms , activation of which can trigger their cellular translocation . PKC activation and structure is isoform dependent [ 261 ] . Abnormal PKC expression is observed in many pathologies , in malignancies PKC plays a complex role , isoforms may act as oncoproteins or tumour suppressors [ 306 , 307 ] . PKC isoforms are involved with other kinases in GPCR phosphorylation [ 275 , 277 ] . Including of CXCR4 following CXCL12 binding [ 279 ] , as this can be prevented by PKCα inhibition [ 280 ] . PKC also modulates signalling through GSK3 a key protein in many signalling pathways including those involving Pi3K , Akt , PKA and Wnt [ 550 - 552 ] . Src plays a key role in cell proliferation and metastasis [ 553 ] . Src levels can modulate cell adhesion and cell migration interacting with many cellular proteins [ 554 ] . Deregulation of Src is key to survival of many malignant cells [ 555 ] . Proliferative and pro - migratory signalling also occurs via the Ras / Raf / MEK / ERK pathway [ 556 , 557 ] . Raf kinases activating MEK1 and MEK2 which subsequently activate ERK1 and ERK2 although there is also purportedly cross - talk between all these signalling proteins , figure 4 . 1 [ 558 , 559 ] . 91 . Figure 4 . 1 : PKC and other key signalling proteins involved in chemotaxis and metastasis . Hypothesis : Signalling through PKC , Src , ROCK and the Ras / Raf / MEK / ERK pathway can initiate metastasis , therefore inhibition of these proteins may prevent migration supported by chemokines CCL3 and CXCL12 . Aim : To explore the role of PKC isoforms , Src , ROCK , Raf , MEK and ERK in CCL3 and CXCL12 - chemotactic migration in cancer cell - lines THP - 1 and Jurkat along with PKCs role in CCL3 and CXCL12 supported wound - healing in MCF7 .

( vi ) Use small molecule inhibitors of Raf , MEK , ERK or ROCK to see if these proteins supported chemotaxis of THP - 1 or Jurkat to CCL3 or CXCL12 . 4 . 2 : Results Please note controls are common between graphs where experiments were conducted simultaneously ; results for each inhibitor or siRNA have been displayed separately for ease of description of results , this applies to : figures 4 . 2A and 4 . 4A ; 4 . 2B , 4 . 7A and 4 . 7B ; 4 . 3A , 4 . 4B , 4 . 6E , 4 . 12A , 4 . 17B , and 4 . 23B ; 4 . 3B , 4 . 4C , 4 . 6F , 4 . 11A , 4 . 24C and 4 . 29C ; 4 . 18 and 5 . 15 ; 4 . 8A and 4 . 8B ; 4 . 6D and 4 . 12B ; 4 . 30A , 4 . 31A , 4 . 33B , 4 . 34B . There are several key proteins implicated in metastasis and in chemokine signalling . These include PKC , Src , MEK , ERK , and Pi3K . Here the effect of pharmacological blockage of these signalling proteins on CXCL12 - and CCL3 - supported cell migration was explored using three different cell - lines , THP - 1 , Jurkat and MCF7 . Firstly the role of PKC in CXCL12 - induced signalling was explored in three cell lines Jurkat , THP - 1 , and MCF7 . Tools employed were small molecule inhibitors , Rottlerin , Staurosporine , CID755673 , GF109203X ( for structures see appendix 4 ) , along with PKC siRNA knockdown of PKCα , δ , and ε . Responses to PKC manipulation were analysed by chemotaxis - , cAMP - and calcium - assays . 4 . 2 . 1 : Rottlerin and PKCδ Rottlerin has been used in many studies as a selective PKCδ inhibitor , but it is not specific , it uncouples mitochondria so reduces ATP levels which may hinder PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation . Rottlerin also is reported to block other kinases and inhibit sodium - dependent glutamate transport and accelerate the transporter degradation , it may also activate calcium and potassium channels hence Rottlerin can produce effects on cells where PKCδ is deleted [ 560 , 561 ] . The effects of Rottlerin and siRNA PKCδ inhibition on CXCL12 - induced chemotaxis in Jurkat was explored , along with siRNA PKCδ inhibition of CXCL12 - induced MCF7 wound - healing . siRNA controls were transfected with nonsense siRNA ( Scr ) , figure 4 . 2 . 93 Jurkat Jurkat MCF7 A B C Figure 4 . 2 : Chemotaxis of Jurkat to 1 nM CXCL12 following pre - treatment with ( A ) Rottlerin 2 μM or control ( Ethanol ) or ( B ) following transfection with 50 nM PKCδ siRNA or nonsense siRNA ( Scram ) control .

Chemotaxis of Jurkat to CXCL12 was not inhibited by Rottlerin 2 μM but was very significantly inhibited ( p < 0 . 001 ) by siRNA knockdown of PKCδ . MCF7 wound - healing confirmed that siRNA PKCδ knockdown has no significant effect on CCL3 - induced wound - healing but significantly ( p < 0 . 01 ) inhibits CXCL12 - induced wound - healing , figure 4 . 2A - D . Unfortunately no antibody was available to confirm the extent of PKCδ knockdown . Others have shown a relationship between PKCδ and cAMP [ 562 ] so the effect of Rottlerin on CXCL12 modulation of cAMP production and also calcium release in Jurkat was explored , figure 4 . 3 .

Jurkat pre - treatment with Rottlerin 4 μM blunted cAMP production but had no significant effect calcium responses in response to CXCL12 stimulation . Rottlerin at 2 μM was found to have no significant inhibitory effects on chemotaxis , or at 4 μM on calcium responses , although it blunted cellular cAMP reduction following CXCL12 stimulation . However PKCδ siRNA knock - down did inhibit Jurkat chemotaxis , suggesting that if there are any Jurkat responses to Rottlerin they are complex . It is possible Rottlerin’s off target effects masked any inhibitory effects . Rottlerin was found to reduce the establishment of cell - cell contacts due to E - cadherin and β - catenin internalization [ 563 ] , and may therefore reduce the cell clumping often observed in Jurkat . Additionally ethanol , the inhibitors solvent , could dehydrate cells , and either effect , less clumping or cell shrinkage , could aid passage through the pores of the Transwell® chemotaxis assay plates and skew results . Additionally Rottlerin at 4 μM is reported to cause apoptosis body formation , this may be via death receptor 5 up - regulation [ 564 ] . Apoptosis - body formation causes the cells to shrink as contents are lost , this could also explain reported increases in chemotaxis assays through the 5 μm pores [ 565 ] . MCF7 scratch assays indicated PKCδ is more relevant to CXCL12 rather than CCL3 - induced wound - healing , figure 4 . 2C . 4 . 2 . 2 : Staurosporine , GF109203X and PKC isoform knockdown Staurosporine is a natural product , an alkaloid isolated from Streptomyces staurosporeus , that has anti - proliferative actions on many cancer cell - lines as it arrests the cell cycle at G2 / M . Staurosporine is also an non - selective inhibitor of PKC with and IC 50 ~ 3 nM , and for cAMP - dependent protein kinase ~ 8 nM . Jurkat caspase - 3 induced - apoptosis , and the release of microparticles ( apoptotic bodies ) , is reported within 2 hours of treatment with staurosporine [ 566 , 567 ] .

The effects of GF109203X at 5 μM which should inhibit all PKC isoenzymes was explored in Jurkat and THP - 1 cells using chemotaxis , cAMP and calcium assays , figure 4 . 6 , the small effects observed on chemotaxis and cAMP assays in THP - 1 may be explained by toxicity rather than any direct effects on PKC’s within cells .

GF109203X at 5 μM did not prevent Jurkat or THP - 1 chemotaxis to CXCL12 , but slightly inhibited chemotaxis of THP - 1 to CCL3 . Also GF109203X significantly modify cAMP in response to 20 minutes CXCL12 10 nM in THP - 1 and Jurkat . An increase in calcium responses to CXCL12 10 nM in Jurkat was also observed . The only dramatic effect of GF109203X appeared to be on calcium responses . GF109203X at 5 μM can be shown to strongly inhibit CXCL12 - induced wound - healing in MCF7 cells [ 565 ] however this could be due to its cytotoxicity . Although at 5 μM GF109203X would be expected to inhibit PKCα , ε and ζ . PKC LOF mutations may remove the breaks on GPCR signalling possibly suggesting in certain circumstances PKC inhibitors could increase chemotactic responses .

This provides a possible mechanism for GF109302X to increase calcium responses , as observed above ; however the very strong orange colouring of GF109302X may also impact on fluorescent assay accuracy . Therefore next the effects of PKCα , and PKCε siRNA knockdown on MCF7 scratch assays and Jurkat chemotaxis were explored , figures 4 . 7 and 4 . 8 .

Knockdown was more complete in MCF7 than Jurkat , figure 4 . 9 , overall suggesting that Jurkat chemotaxis to CXCL12 is highly sensitive to PKCα knockdown .

The chemotaxis assays suggested that in Jurkat CXCL12 - induced chemotaxis may be more sensitive to PKCα and PKCδ inhibition than PKCε , further experiments are required to confirm this , but one influence on results may be the low expression of novel and atypical PKCs in Jurkat [ 570 ] . MCF7 CXCL12 - and CCL3 - induced wound - healing was inhibited by PKCα but not by PKCε , whereas PKCδ knockdown specifically inhibited CXCL12 but not CCL3 migration , figure 4 . 2 above . PKCζ knockdown was also explored in Jurkat and MCF7 , see chapter 8 section 8 . 2 . 13 . 4 . 2 . 3 : PKD ( PKCμ ) activity is important for CCL3 - but not CXCL12 - induced chemotaxis in THP - 1 cells , and for CXCL12 - induced chemotaxis in Jurkat Protein Kinase D ( aka PKCμ ) is a calmodulin - dependent kinase so also a target of DAG . There are 3 PKD isoforms PKD1 , PKD2 and PKD3 . PKD is controlled by PKC - dependent mechanisms . PKC isoforms activate PKD by serine phosphorylation of PKD’s activation loop . The PKD pathway is involved through NFκB in cell survival and proliferation , and transport of proteins from Golgi to plasma membrane and cell migration [ 571 , 572 ] . Transmembrane glycoprotein E - cadherin , critical for cell - cell adhesions , can be phosphorylated by PKD1 when they co - localise . In cancer such phosphorylation reduces cellular motility . E - cadherin’s cytoplasmic tail is anchored to actin via catenins , including β - catenin [ 573 ] . When a cell migrates a lamellipodium pushes out at the leading edge , attaches to substrate , and pulls the cell forward , if anchorage is not achieved the lamellipodium flows back into the cell forming a membrane ruffle , any particles adhering to the top or bottom surfaces also move back , this is retrograde flow . Inhibiting PKD inhibits retrograde membrane transport and actin - dependent membrane ruffles hence cytoskeleton dynamics . PKD is reported to be involved in directional lamellipodia formation . In the absence of PKD Rac1 can restore lamellipodia formation but there is still loss of directional migration [ 574 ] . The effects of the PKD inhibitor CID755673 and β - catenin inhibitor FH535 were explored in Jurkat and THP - 1 . In MCF7 wound - healing assays 5 μM CID755673 over 24 hours caused cell death ( data 101 not shown ) reflecting the significant inhibition of metabolism shown in MTS assay over 24 hour , figure 4 . 15A . CID755673 did not significantly inhibit metabolism in THP - 1 , figure 4 . 15B , but very significantly inhibited Jurkat chemotaxis and calcium flux and produced chemokine specific responses on THP - 1 migration , figures 4 . 10 and 4 . 11 .

Possibly supporting the conclusions from the chemotaxis assays that PKD inhibition may produce modest cell - type and chemokine specific effects . In contrast β - catenin inhibition reduced Jurkat and THP - 1 chemotaxis to CXCL12 as well as THP - 1 chemotaxis towards CCL3 .

Overall results suggest PKD is important in Jurkat for calcium , cAMP and chemotactic responses to CXCL12 . Inhibiting PKCμ ( PKD ) in Jurkat reduces calcium responses , but inhibiting PKC with Rottlerin and Staurosporine have no significant effect the effects . GF109203X inhibits PKCα , ε and ζ ; may increase calcium flux or its effects may be due to fluorescent assay interference as the inhibitor has a strong fluorescent orange colouring . Overall results suggest PKC signalling in MCF7 , THP - 1 and Jurkat is isoform , chemokine and cell - type specific . 4 . 2 . 6 : Src and Ras / Raf / MEK / ERK signalling appear important for CCL3 and CXCL12 induced migration in THP - 1 and MCF7 and for CXCL12 - induced migration in Jurkat c - Src protein tyrosine kinases ( Src ) are a family of non - receptor tyrosine kinases which have roles in cell signalling , adhesion , proliferation and migration . Src functions in agonist - induced receptor desensitization [ 553 ] . Both raised and lowered Src activity can alter cell migration . Over expression of Src can modulated cell dynamics and adhesion to other tissues . Src supports migration by aiding both cell adhesion to integrins and also disruption of cell - cell focal contacts , so has the potential to help leukocytes move through the extracellular matrix . Cofilin is involved in cellular dynamics and Focal Adhesion Kinase ( FAK ) in cell adhesion . Upregulation of Src does not alter the levels of FAK but increases its phosphorylation state , whereas Src upregulation decreases phosphorylation of cofilin , increasing F - actin dynamics , triggering cellular activity such as filopodia Jurkats Ca 2 + Fura2 AM Assay CXCL12 10 nM 27 . 12 . 16 n = 3 C on t r o l M  C I D 755673 5 M  G F 109203 X 5 S t a u r o s po r i n e 10 n M M  R o tt l e r i n 4 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 * * * *  340 /  380 Jurkat Fura 2AM Ca 2 + AUC Assay CXCL12 10 nM n  4 27 . 12 . 16 c on t r o l M  C I D 755673 5 M  G F 109202 X 5 S t a u r o s po r i n e 10 n M M  R o tt l e r i n 4 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 * * * * * * AUC 104 formation .

It can be seen that Bosutinib even at low concentrations significantly inhibits basal migration in THP - 1 , figure 4 . 15B & C , and appears to modify filament actin formations in CHO . CCR5 . Bosutinib did not significantly modify calcium signalling but reduced cAMP levels , figure 4 . 17 . However in addition to inhibiting Src Bosutinib also inhibits Src - family kinases Lyn and HCK , and is also reported to reduce signalling via Pi3K / Akt / mTOR , JAK / STAT3 and MAPK / ERK pathways [ 575 ] . The above results show Bosutinib can inhibit cell migration in presence and absence of chemokines CCL3 and CXCL12 , but to explore if this was due to Src inhibition alone siRNA knockdown was undertaken . 4 . 2 . 7 : Src siRNA knockdown also inhibits cell migration Src knockdown , using Src siRNA at 50 nM confirmed the importance of Src signalling in MCF7 and THP - 1 migration to CCL3 and CXCL12 and Jurkat chemotaxis to CXCL12 , figures 4 . 18 and 4 . 19 .

The above data confirms other studies that suggest Src signalling is critically important in chemokine - induced migration in both leukemic and breast cancer malignancies . For example Src deregulation is important in the cell proliferation , adhesion , invasion , migration and survival of breast malignancies ; and in oncogenic resistance by protecting cells from chemotherapy - induced apoptosis [ 555 ] . CXCR4 expression correlates with breast cancer aggressiveness and poor prognosis [ 576 ] . Also CXCL12 signalling through CXCR4 links to the BCR / ABL fusion oncoprotein which causes and maintains chronic myelogenous leukaemia ( CML ) . BCR / ABL phosphorylates so activates and dysregulates normal bone marrow progenitor and stem cells causing immature dysfunctional cells to populated the blood and spleen , the phenotype of CML . CXCL12 / CXCR4 signalling via Src facilitates BCR / ABL oncoprotein to control CXCL12 signalling through both Pi3K and Ras / MAPK pathways [ 577 , 578 ] . 4 . 2 . 8 : Signalling through the Ras / Raf / MEK / ERK pathway lacks chemokine or cell specificity The effects of p38 MAPK inhibition and ERK inhibition on CCL3 and CXCL12 - induced chemotaxis in leukemic cells was explored using the following small molecule inhibitors , SB203580 , which inhibits p38 - MAPK stimulation of MAPK APK2 and total SAPK / JNK activity . L779450 which inhibits Raf kinase , and PD98059 which inhibits ERK1 / 2 and SL327 which inhibits MEK1 / 2 . MAPK / ERK signalling involves the activation by GRKs of small G - protein Ras followed by a Raf , MEK and ERK protein kinases phosphorylation cascade . Malignancies involve uncontrolled growth ; this is often due to aberrant MAPK / ERK signalling . There are three homologues of Raf ; B - Raf , A - Raf and Raf 1 also known as C - Raf . In humans , all are kinase components of the Ras / Raf / MEK / ERK signalling pathway . Raf kinases activate MEK1 and MEK2 also known as type 1 and 2 MAP kinase kinases and Mitogen Extracellular signal regulated kinase ( MAPKK ) . MEK threonine and tyrosine kinases subsequently phosphorylate ERK1 and ERK2 thus signals are transferred from cell membrane to cellular effectors regulating cell motility , proliferation and apoptosis [ 556 , 557 , 579 ] . Of the three Raf proteins B - Raf may be the most potent due to its high affinity for MEK1 [ 580 ] , however there may be cross - talk between Raf homologues [ 558 ] and feedback from ERK1 and ERK2 may inhibit Raf - 1 phosphorylation so activation [ 556 ] while downregulating MEK2 and upregulating MEK1 [ 559 ] , figure 4 . 21 . 109 Figure 4 . 21 : Inhibitors and feedback affecting the mitogenic Ras / Raf / MEK / ERK and ROCK signalling pathways [ 556 - 558 , 579 , 580 ] . Others have used the Raf - 1 inhibitor 2 - Chloro - 5 - [ 2 - phenyl - 4 - ( 4 - pyridinyl ) - 1 H - imidazol - 5 - yl ] phenol ( L779450 ) ( for structure see appendix 4 ) , at 10 μM for 24 hours to explore the relationship between Raf - 1 inhibition and apoptosis regulation , L779540 was found to have a pro - apoptosis affect , and this was attributed to its ability to inhibit Raf - 1 [ 579 ] . MTS assay here found L779540 at the concentrations used here had no effect on cell metabolism over seven hours but caused significant toxicity over twenty - four hours , figure 4 . 23 , hence L779450 , which inhibits Raf - 1 by competing for ATP at the protein kinase catalytic site , was only used to explore the effect of Raf - 1 inhibition on chemotaxis in Jurkat cells to CXCL12 and THP - 1 cells to CXCL12 and CCL3 . Inhibition of Raf 1 with 1 μM L779450 significantly reduced CXCL12 - and CCL3 - induced chemotaxis in THP - 1 and CXCL12 - induced chemotaxis in Jurkat , figures 4 . 22 .

CXCL12 can induce chemotaxis but can also in some circumstances induce proliferation , for example in leukemic cells in stromal cultures . Such proliferation can be prevented by CXCR4 antagonists such as AMD3100 [ 581 ] . CXCL12 appears not to have proliferative effects on normal leukocytes in stromal cultures [ 582 ] .

Results show targeting signalling through ERK1 / ERK2 with PD98059 or p38 MAPK with SB203580 can specifically inhibit chemotaxis in Jurkat and THP - 1 to these chemokines , and that the reduction in chemotaxis is not due to toxic effects of the inhibitors on cell metabolism . 4 . 2 . 9 : Inhibiting pairs of signalling proteins provides further evidence of signalling through Src and Ras / Raf / MEK / ERK pathways triggered by CXCL12 and CCL3 . The Ras / Raf / MEK / ERK pathway is often dysregulated in malignancies . This can be due to BRAF or NRAS mutations [ 584 ] . BRAF and NRAS can be targeted therapeutically but often resistance develops [ 585 , 586 ] . A situation where targeting downstream Raf , MEK or ERK signalling may be helpful . However MEK inhibition may induce unhelpful Pi3K signalling [ 587 ] . Metastatic cells can invade or escape tissues by stimulating matrix metalloproteases ( MMP’s ) digestion of the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , this can be activated by MEK / ERK signalling . To migrate cancer cells attach to the extracellular matrix and then need to change shape , which requires Rho / ROCK - mediated actin dynamics [ 588 ] . Cell movement requires integrin - mediated ECM adhesion which is itself regulated by SRC kinases , and can be inhibited by Src inhibitors [ 589 ] . Src kinases are implicated in both cell invasion and cell migration , and aberrant Src signalling is implicated in many cancers [ 590 ] . Inhibition of pairs of proteins involved in Src / Ras / Raf / MEK / ERK CXCL12 and CCL3 signalling was explored to look for synergistic inhibition of chemotaxis that may be applicable to preventing metastatic spread , figures 4 . 30 - 4 . 34 .

Combined low dose Raf ( 0 . 5 μM L779450 ) and ERK ( 12 . 5 μM PD98059 ) inhibition produces slightly greater inhibition of chemotaxis than L779450 or PD98059 at the same concentrations alone in THP - 1 to CCL3 or CXCL12 but not in Jurkat to CXCL12 , figure 4 . 30 .

Similarly in THP - 1 combined low dose Raf ( 0 . 5 μM L779450 ) and MEK ( 0 . 5 μM SL327 ) inhibition produced only slightly greater inhibition ( p < 0 . 05 ) than Raf or MEK inhibition alone in CCL3 and a slightly increased response ( p < 0 . 01 ) in CXCL12 - induced chemotaxis , figure 4 . 31 .

At the higher concentration ethanoic solutions of Rottlerin may increase migration in Jurkat towards CXCL12 [ 565 ] , this may be as Rottlerin has been shown to induce malignancy in human and rat fibroblasts and can block apoptosis in cells suffering DNA damage [ 591 ] . Rottlerin therefore may inhibit cell death in malignant cell - lines such as Jurkat . The Rottlerin used in these experiments was active as was shown to inhibit MCF7 wound - healing ( published experiments undertaken by Dr Anja Mueller [ 565 ] ) . Here very different effects were found with siRNA knockdown of PKCδ compared to Rottlerin treatment , chemotaxis was significantly reduced by PKCδ , figure 4 . 2 . This was somewhat surprising as PKCδ can act as a tumour suppressor as over expression can stall the cell cycle at G2 / M , and its inhibition is reported to support malignancies [ 592 ] . PKCδ and PKCε can have opposite effects . PKCδ can be THP - 1 L779450 0 . 5  M AS605240 0 . 5  M 11 . 12 . 14 n = 3 CXCL12 1nM C X C L 12 + A S 605240 C X C L 12 + L 779450 C X C L 12 + L 779450 & A S 605240 C X C L 12 + no i nh i b i t o r N o c h e m o k i n e , no i nh i b i t o r 0 25 50 75 100 125 * * * ns M i g r a t i ng ce ll s x 10 4 m L - 1 THP - 1 L779450 0 . 5  M AS605240 0 . 5  M 09 . 12 . 14 n = 3 CCL3 1nM C C L 3 + A S 605240 C C L 3 + L 779450 C C L 3 + L 779450 & A S 605240 C C L 3 + no i nh i b i t o r N o c h e m o k i n e , no i nh i b i t o r 0 100 200 ns M i g r a t i ng ce ll s x 10 4 m L - 1 Jurkat Bosutinib 0 . 5  M L779450 0 . 5  M 31 . 03 . 15 n = 3 C X C L 12 + B o s u t i n i b C X C L 12 + L 779450 & B o s u t i n i b C X C L 12 + L 779450 C X C L 12 + no i nh i b i t o r N o c h e m o k i n e , no i nh i b i t o r 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 ns * * M i g r a t i ng ce ll s x 10 4 m L - 1 117 pro - apoptotic and inhibit cell proliferation , and can reduce mitochondrial activity inducing apoptosis , whereas in ischaemia PKCε can prevent mitochondrial damage and cell death [ 593 ] . Similarly PKCε supports NIH3T3 fibroblast cell - line proliferation whereas PKCδ may support myeloid and epithelial cell differentiation [ 594 , 595 ] . PKCδ may be activated by Caspase - mediated proteolytic mechanisms aiding apoptosis in UV or carcinogen damaged keratinocytes preventing skin cancers [ 596 ] . Also PKCδ inhibition can support neoplastic transformation . Ras activating mutations , acting via Transforming Growth Factor alpha ( TGFα ) can have opposing effects reducing PKCδ activation via phosphorylation and expression but not inhibiting PKCα , PKCε or PKCζ [ 597 ] . 4 . 3 . 1 : Roles of PKCα in malignancies PKCα is ubiquitously expressed , it promotes cell growth , migration and inhibits apoptosis [ 598 ] , but PKCα can support both pro - and anti - tumorigenic signalling . PKC effects can show cell - type specificity , but also produce opposite effects in similar cells . For example PKCα upregulated ERK1 / 2 signalling supporting PAR2 - induced cell proliferation , migration and survival in a metastatic colon cell - line [ 599 ] . Conversely PKCα can phosphorylate β - catenin marking it for proteosome degradation , reducing Wnt / β - catenin signalling and the cyclin D1 and c - Myc expression which supports proliferation of colon cancers [ 600 ] . Also inhibition of PKCα has been shown to inhibit the mesenchymal - amoeboid transition of cells including MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells , reducing amoeboid invasiveness , hence PKCα may support breast cancer metastasis [ 601 ] . This may explain why here knockdown of PKCα reduced CCL3 - and CXCL12 - induced wound - healing in MCF7 breast cancer cell - line , figure 4 . 8 . PKC expression levels in cancers can vary as every cancer is genetically different , but also as PKC - regulated signalling pathways can be modulated by the oncogenes expressed in any particular cancer or cell - line [ 602 ] . For example PKCα deletion increased lung mutations where K - Ras was activated [ 603 ] and PKCα inhibitor GÖ6976 decreased migration of colon cancer cells SW480 [ 604 ] whereas in MDA - MD - 231 breast cancer cells PKCα activation inhibited cell motility [ 605 ] . This may be why assays comparing small molecule inhibitors with siRNA knockdown , and result in different cell - lines can lead to opposite conclusions . Also small molecule inhibitors are rarely specific for example GÖ6976 is marketed as a specific PKCα inhibitor but also hits PKCβ [ 606 ] JAK2 , FLT3 [ 607 ] , and PKCμ ( PKD ) [ 608 ] . 4 . 3 . 2 : PKCε upregulation may support cell survival , invasion and motility PKCε upregulation is seen in some cancers [ 609 ] , it has been found to increase the rate of cell replication in some cell - lines [ 610 ] , and the malignant transformation potential of other 118 carcinogens albeit in mice [ 611 ] . PKCε over expression also inhibits apoptosis in leukaemic [ 612 ] and breast cancer cells [ 613 ] . PKCε inhibits programmed cell death triggered both through the extrinsic pathway , through ligand activation of receptors [ 614 ] , and the intrinsic pathway involving mitochondrial release of apoptotic factors in cellular stress . These direct Activating Transcription Factor 2 ( ATF2 ) to mitochondria increasing membrane permeability and cytochrome C release which activates caspases triggering apoptosis [ 615 ] . PKCε can phosphorylate ATF2 causing its translocation to the nucleus , therefore overexpression of PKCε can inhibit mitochondrial triggered apoptosis . This has been observed in MCF7 [ 613 ] . TNF can produce extrinsic triggered apoptosis , overexpression of PKCε inhibits this process [ 616 ] . Inhibiting PKCε inhibits apoptotic effects of TNF in lymphomas cells [ 617 ] . So PKCε can promote cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis [ 262 ] . Certainly here siRNA knockdown of PKCε appeared to have less effect than knockdown of PKCα , figures 4 . 7 - 4 . 8 however the extent of PKCε knockdown was not established . PKB ( Akt ) regulates cell survival , proliferation [ 618 ] and metastasis . In MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells which overexpress PKCε silencing PKCε decreased proliferation , invasion and motility and metastasis ( in mice ) [ 619 ] similar results were seen in HNSCC cells where PKCε supported RhoA and RhoC signalling [ 620 ] . Here PKCε knockdown appeared have greater effects in Jurkat than MCF7 , figures 4 . 7 - 4 . 8 , but again the extent of knockdown was not analysed as no PKCε antibody was available in the laboratory . Non - selective PKC inhibitor staurosporine had no effect on Jurkat CXCL12 - stimulated chemotaxis , cAMP or calcium assays , figures 4 . 4 and 4 . 14 . Staurosporine’s effects on Jurkat have been studied by others . CXCR4 undergoes slow CXCL12 - independent internalisation and recycling . PKC can trigger endocytosis signalling , but CXCR4 trafficking can vary by cell type [ 279 ] . Pre - treatment of Jurkat with 10 nM Staurosporine was shown to restore CXCR4 expression reduced by phorbol ester ( PMA ) treatment , leading researchers to conclude that CXCR4 internalisation in Jurkat is via PKC [ 570 ] . CXCR4 internalisation has previously been shown to be mediated by PKC , however CXCL12 and phorbol ester may induced CXCR4 internalisation involving differing pathways , whereas phorbol esters require PKC , PKC usage via CXCL12 induced CXCR4 internalisation was not inhibited by Staurosporine [ 279 , 621 ] . Therefore the slight inhibition of chemotaxis observed here , figure 4 . 4 , may be due more to Staurosporine off target effects than PKC inhibition . Pan PKC inhibitor GF109203X in Jurkat had no effect on CXCL12 - induced cAMP production or chemotaxis but dramatically increased calcium flux whereas in THP - 1 GF109203X reduced CCL3 - but not CXCL12 - induced chemotaxis , figures 4 . 5 - 4 . 6 and 4 . 14 . 119 In Jurkat the siRNA and small inhibitor approaches to inactivating PKC were not complementary , suggesting in Jurkat siRNA knockdown may produce either more effective or specific silencing of PKC than Rottlerin , staurosporine or GF109203X . CID755673 , which targets PKCμ ( PKD ) , inhibited CCL3 - but not CXCL12 - induced chemotaxis in THP - 1 and strongly inhibited CXCL12 - induced calcium flux and chemotaxis in Jurkat . PKCμ inhibition also produced opposite but both non - significant effects on cAMP levels before and after CXCL12 stimulation in Jurkat and THP - 1 , suggesting that PKCμ usage may be cell type specific , figures 4 . 10 - 4 . 12 and 4 . 14 . 4 . 3 . 3 : PKC signalling through GSK3 , Slingshot and cofilin Glycogen synthase kinase 3 ( GSK3 ) is a key protein in many signalling pathways including those of Wnt and Pi3K [ 550 ] . It exists as two isoforms GSK3α , and GSKβ . GSK3 is tonically active in resting cells . GSK3 can be activated by phosphorylation on its T - loop , and inactivated by phosphorylation in various locations including GSK3’s N - and C - terminals in response to PKC , p38MAPK , Erk , PKCα , Akt and PKA signalling [ 551 , 552 ] , figure 4 . 36 . Figure 4 . 36 : Many proteins activate or inactivate GSK3 , including PKC [ 552 , 622 ] . Here Raf inhibition with L779450 reduced Jurkat CXCL12 - induced chemotaxis but did not significantly alter cAMP levels , figure 4 . 23 . Whereas the PKC inhibitors mainly blunted cAMP responses to CXCL12 , figures 4 . 3 - 4 . 4 , 4 . 6 and 4 . 12 . Raf - inhibition also reduced calcium peak fluorescence and total calcium release in response to CXCL12 stimulus in Jurkat and to CCL3 stimulus in THP - 1 . Raf inhibition in THP - 1 decreased both CCL3 - and CXCL12 - induced chemotaxis , figures 4 . 22 - 4 . 24 , Also ERK1 / 2 inhibitor PD98059 prevented chemotaxis in Jurkat to CXCL12 and THP - 1 to CCL3 and blunted cAMP responses , but had no significant effect on chemokine stimulated calcium - responses , figures 4 . 27 - 4 . 29 . These results suggest the Raf / MEK / ERK signalling pathway may be critically important for CCL3 - and CXCL12 - induced migration in these leukemic GSK3 Raf MEK 1 / 2 ERK 1 / 2 PLC DAG PKC Pi3K PKB PPA2 Akt AC cAMP ATP PKA p38MAPK α γ P β chemokine β - arrestin 120 cell - lines . The cAMP responses suggest cross - talk , possibly through GSK3 , figure 4 . 36 , and / or other intermediaries may influence chemotaxis . Similarly p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 strongly inhibits chemotaxis of Jurkat to CXCL12 and THP - 1 to CCL3 , figure 4 . 25 - 4 . 26 . Combining Raf and Pi3K inhibition produced additive effects on CXCL12 but not CCL3 - induced chemotaxis , figures 4 . 33 - 4 . 34 , suggesting biased signalling , Pi3K being more important for CXCL12 but not CCL3 - triggered chemotaxis , this is covered further in chapter 5 , section 5 . 2 . 6 of this thesis . Combining Src with Raf inhibition , using Bosutinib with L779450 , produced no greater inhibition than Src alone , suggesting Src operates near the receptor , high in the signalling pathway , figure 4 . 35 . Whereas Raf with MEK ( SL327 ) , Raf with ERK 1 / 2 ( PD98059 ) , and Raf with ROCK ( Y27632 ) inhibition all produced additive inhibitory effects on effect chemotaxis to CXCL12 and CCL3 , figures 4 . 30 - 4 . 32 . Again this indicated the importance of Raf / MEK / ERK signalling for chemotaxis in these cell - lines , but also suggesting cross - talk with ROCK , occurs from the Raf / Ras / MEK / ERK cascade . Inhibition of ROCK in adherent cells can inhibit detachment apoptosis which is linked to Rho / ROCK pathway phosphorylation ( activation ) of cytoskeletal components and actin - myosin contraction which disrupts the E - cadherin mediated cell - cell adhesion balance with actin - myosin contraction [ 623 ] . By suppressing ROCK PPARγ is upregulated and PPARγ inhibits GSK3B which allows more β - catenin to move to membrane supporting E - cadherin cell - cell adhesion . Selective PPARγ agonists such as pioglitazone are reported to add to the effects of ROCK inhibitor Y27632 [ 624 ] . E - cadherin by recruiting β - catenin inhibits β - catenin nuclear translocation where it will aid the transcription of genes such as c - myc and cyclin D1 facilitating cell proliferation [ 624 , 625 ] , figure 4 . 37 . β - catenin inhibition with FH535 , figure 4 . 13 , was found to significantly reduce CXCL12 - induced chemotaxis in Jurkat and CXCL12 and CCL3 - induced chemotaxis in THP - 1 . 121 Figure 4 . 37 : Effects of ROCK inhibition on β - catenin signalling [ 552 , 623 , 625 ] . GSK3 inhibition reportedly does not stop CXCL12 phosphorylation of serines in CXCR4 C - terminal [ 280 ] however GSK3 can inactivate Slingshot ( SSH ) [ 34 ] . Slingshot dephosphorylates ( activates ) cofilin , a key protein in cell migration , figure 4 . 38 , discussed further here in chapters 5 - 8 . Figure 4 . 38 : PKC signalling through GSK3 , Slingshot and cofilin [ 34 , 280 ] . 4 . 4 : Conclusions The above data suggest Src and PKC are key signalling proteins in CXCL12 - and CCL3 - induced migration of both the leukaemic and breast cancer cell - lines employed here . Src knockdown with siRNA and small molecule inhibitor Bosutinib produced similar responses . PKC isoenzyme specific responses were apparent with PKCα , PKCδ and PKCμ ( PKD ) being key for CXCL12 signalling , off target effects were possible issues with some small molecule inhibitors of PKC . Overall PKC involvement in CCL3 and CXCL12 - induced migration was found to be isoform and cell type specific . Signalling through β - catenin , Src and the Raf / MEK / ERK pathway was not found to be chemokine specific , all of the pathway proteins were important for CCL3 - and CXCL12 - induced chemotaxis in THP - 1 and Jurkat . This conclusion was supported by the additive effects found between inhibition of Raf plus ERK , Raf plus MEK , and Raf plus ROCK . Inhibition of Raf plus Pi3K GSK3B RhoA ROCK PIP5K PPARγ β - catenin E - c a dh e r i n Y27632 cytoskeleton + cofilin cofilin Slingshot P GSK3 α γ P chemokine β Cofilin active – migration GSK3 inactivated by PKCα cofilin cofilin Slingshot P GSK3 Phosphocofilin – inactive GSK3 active siRNA knockdown 122 produced inhibition of CXCL12 - but not CCL3 - induced chemotaxis , suggesting CXCL12 / CCL3 biased signalling through Pi3K and supporting the use of combination therapies to inhibit more than one mitogenic signalling pathway in metastatic cancers . The data presented provides evidence for chemokine and cell - type favoured signalling pathways but also obvious cross talk , as where one signalling pathway or component is inhibited other signalling routes appear to ensure chemotactic attraction continues albeit to a reduced extent . Thus signalling pathways originating from any specific receptor , such as CXCR4 or CCR5 , cannot be generalised between chemokines or between cell types ; this may frustrate pharmacologists but may provide oncologists opportunities to develop targeted therapeutic molecules . There are many other proteins purportedly involved in cell migration leading to metastasis , important ones include β - arrestins along with cofilin , a cytoskeleton - associated protein that controls actin dynamics . β - arrestins can dephosphorylate and so activate cofilin and spatially regulate cofilin activity [ 626 ] therefore in chapter 5 the CXCL12 and CCL3 signalling involving these proteins was explored . 123 Chapter 5 : CXCL12 and CCL3 chemokine - induced migration in leukaemic and breast cancer cells can involve cofilin phosphorylation , Pi3K and β - arrestins 5 . 1 : Introduction Cell dynamics leading to metastasis involves a myriad of signalling and mechanical proteins and the hijacking of homeostatic chemotactic cell migration . Chemotaxis requires a directional leading edge ; a small protein called cofilin is key to this process . Cofilin forms co - fil aments with act in facilitating both EMT and metastasis [ 627 ] . Cofilin has three isomers cofilin - 1 ( non - muscle ) , cofilin - 2 ( muscle ) and destrin ( aka ADF ) [ 628 , 629 ] . Throughout this thesis reference to cofilin refers to cofilin - 1 . Cofilin expression is upregulated in many cell lines and cofilin activity is controlled by phosphorylation and ATP . De - phosphorylation by phosphatases such as PP2 and Slingshot , itself directed by proteins such as Pi3K , activates cofilin [ 375 , 376 ] . This allows cofilin to bind actin , causing filament fragmentation and so producing a source of actin filament - initiation barbed ends and actin monomers to build new filaments [ 373 ] . Cofilin is inactivated by LIMK phosphorylation mediated by Rho GTPases Rac , Rho and Cdc42 [ 630 , 631 ] . Metastasis and malignant cell invasion of healthy tissue have been associated with reduced LIM kinase ( LIMK ) expression and associated lower levels of phosphorylated cofilin [ 632 ] . Cell location of phosphorylated cofilin is influenced by 14 - 3 - 3 regulatory proteins sequestering Slingshot and also cell membrane PIP 2 sequestering cofilin . PIP 2 itself can be modulated by PLCγ [ 381 , 384 ] , figure 5 . 1 . Figure 5 . 1 : Summary of actin remodelling and the involvement of cofilin [ 375 , 376 , 386 , 630 ] .

Aim : To explore the role of β - arrestin and cofilin in CCL3 and CXCL12 chemokinesis ; observe the effects , on chemotaxis and cofilin phosphorylation , of inhibition of signalling transducers Gβγ and GRKs , and key signalling proteins in metastasis Raf , MEK , Pi3K , ROCK and Src . Objectives : ( i ) Establish that cofilin is expressed in cell - lines ( ii ) Explore the effects of siRNA knockdown of cofilin ( iii ) To investigate the effect of chemokines alone and in combinations on chemotactic migration and cofilin phosphorylation ( iv ) Explore the effects on chemotaxis and cofilin phosphorylation of Pi3K inhibition and Pi3K siRNA knockdown , and also of Gβγ , GRK , FAK , ROCK , and MEK small molecule inhibition . ( v ) Explore the effects of over - expression of β - arrestins on chemokinesis in MCF7 , and chemotactic migration in THP - 1 and Jurkat . 5 . 2 : Results Please note controls are common between graphs where experiments were conducted simultaneously ; results for each inhibitor or siRNA have been displayed separately for ease of description of results , this applies to : figures 5 . 15 and 4 . 18 ; 5 . 21D and 5 . 27 . 5 . 2 . 1 : Cofilin modulates leading edge dynamics Cofilin is highly expressed in human T - cells ; it regulates their movement especially through 3D environments [ 633 ] . Therefore Jurkat were first explored as a tool for examining cofilin phosphorylation in response to CXCL12 stimulus . However westerns extracting cytoplasmic but not nuclear cofilin , showed consistent high expression of both phosphorylated cofilin and cofilin , in the presence or absence of CXCL12 , figure 5 . 2 . Hence Jurkat did not offer a sensitive readout tool . 125 Jurkat Treatment C o n t r o l C X C L 12 C o n t r o l C X C L 12 KDa Phosphocofilin ←19 Cofilin ←19 Arrestin ( loading ) ←49 Figure 5 . 2 : Western Blot with total - cofilin and phosphocofilin ( Ser3 ) antibodies reveals cofilin phosphorylation levels in Jurkat in presence and absence of CXCL12 ( 5 nM , 15 mins before lysis ) .

In THP - 1 various chemokines were found to dramatically alter the phosphorylation state of cofilin , figure 5 . 4 . Results showed that cofilin is present in the phosphorylated and un - phosphorylated forms in unstimulated THP - 1 cells at variable levels , so the phosphorylation state of the control , which must be prepared at the same time , was considered alongside results . Basal phosphorylation state may be partly due to the phosphatase activity of Slingshot whose concentration has been shown to vary between different subcellular compartments , and observed to change during the cell division cycle in cultured cells ; levels increasing as mitosis proceeds , with maximum levels during telophase and cytokinesis when Slingshot is required to dephosphorylate and reactivate cofilin [ 634 - 636 ] . 5 . 2 . 4 : Chemotactic responses to chemokines are concentration dependent Many chemokines can be shown to induce chemotaxis in THP - 1 cells , figure 5 . 5A , although Jurkat only significantly respond to CXCL12 . A Gaussian distribution response to CXCL12 chemokine dose was observed for both cell types ; this is also the case for THP - 1 chemotaxis to CCL3 , figures 5 . 5 and 5 . 6 . 128 THP - 1 THP - 1 THP - 1 A B C Figure 5 . 5 : ( A ) THP - 1 chemotactic response to various chemokines .

Results in THP - 1 suggested that if a chemokine produced cofilin phosphorylation it may also be chemotactic .

Such co - operation appeared not always to be the case between CC - and CXC - chemokines ; for example in THP - 1 with CCL2 and CXCL11 , or CCL2 and CXCL9 , there was no significant additive effect . CXCL11 produced chemotaxis in THP - 1 but little response in Jurkat , however in THP - 1 and Jurkat CXCL11 significantly reduced chemotaxis to CXCL12 . CXCL11 purportedly can bind CXCR7 and CXCR3 , therefore these results may suggest that stimulation of CXCR7 by CXCL12 contributes to CXCR4 - induced chemotaxis , figure 5 . 7 . Other concentration combinations of these chemokines may produce different responses .

The antibody 12G5 binds CXCR4 inhibiting chemotaxis to CXCL12 in both Jurkat and THP - 1 . Pre - treatment with 12G5 antibody also inhibited chemotaxis to CXCL11 and CCL3 in THP - 1 possibly indicating that CXCR4 supports chemotaxis to both these chemokines in this cell type . In Jurkat pre - treatment with 12G5 reversed some of the negative effects of adding CXCL11 to CXCL12 as a chemoattractant , suggesting the Jurkat expressed CXCR4 and CXCR7 , but not CXCR3 . In Jurkat and THP - 1 pre - treatment with CXCL11 reduced chemotaxis to CXCL12 and combined CXCL12 and CXCL11 , pointing to these cells expressing CXCR4 , CXCR3 and / or CXCR7 , figure 5 . 8 .

These results suggest co - operation or dimerization of chemokine receptors or indeed chemokines may contribute to chemotaxis in both THP - 1 and Jurkat . Co - operative effects of chemokines on calcium flux were also investigated in MCF7 and THP - 1 cells . Both cell types respond well to CCL3 and CXCL12 , MCF7 have been shown to highly express CXCR4 and CXCR7 but not CXCR3 [ 637 ] . CXCR7 and CXCR3 respond to CXCL11 . CXCL11 pre - treatment of MCF7 cells before calcium flux induced by CXCL12 indicated pre - stimulation of CXCR7 inhibited calcium oscillations , figure 5 . 9 . Overall these results suggest that CXCL11 supports dimerization or co - internalisation of CXCR7 and CXCR4 receptors in MCF7 , THP - 1 and Jurkat .

Hence next the effect of Pi3K inhibition on cofilin phosphorylation and cell migration was examined . There are many Pi3K subtypes [ 640 ] including dimer 1A which can act as a lipid and protein kinase , it contains catalytic subunit p110 and regulatory subunit p85 . Binding of p110 to Ras causes Pi3K activation producing second messenger PIP 3 at the membrane . PIP 3 binds Akt and the kinase PDK1 which itself binds and activates Akt and Rac . Akt can then activate and inhibit various downstream proteins including Caspase - 9 and NFκB regulating for example apoptosis , proliferation , and migration [ 641 ] . Rac activity may be essential for lamellipodia formation [ 642 ] . By influencing Slingshot and thus cofilin phosphorylation Pi3K may mediate actin filament formation and membrane protrusion [ 643 ] . 5 . 2 . 6 : Pi3K inhibition and chemokine - induced migration Previous studies have indicated that inhibiting Pi3K signalling may block cofilin dephosphorylation [ 644 , 645 ] . Chemotaxis investigations using inhibitors LY294002 which reversibly inhibits Pi3Kα , Pi3Kδ and Pi3Kβ with IC 50 ’s of 0 . 5 μM , 0 . 57 μM and 0 . 97 μM , respectively , along with AS605240 a potent and selective inhibitor of Pi3Kγ with an IC 50 of 8 nM and a 30 - fold selectivity over Pi3Kδ and Pi3Kβ and 7 . 5 - fold selectivity over Pi3Kα indicate that the Pi3K pathway may be involved in migration towards CXCL12 in Jurkat and THP - 1 , and that Pi3K may have little or no involvement in CCL3 - induced chemotaxis in THP - 1 , figures 5 . 12 and 5 . 13 .

Western Blot 24 hours post - transfection using anti - Pi3K ( p85α ) antibody , loading confirmed with β - actin in ( A ) Jurkat , ( B ) MCF7 and ( C ) THP - 1 . As above results indicate cofilin’s phosphorylation state correlates with a cell’s ability to migrate towards a chemokine , and chemotaxis to CCL3 and CXCL12 involves Pi3K . Possibly due to Pi3K signalling influencing phosphatase slingshot’s modification of cofilin’s phosphorylation state [ 645 ] . The ability of Pi3K inhibition to directly modulate cofilin phosphorylation was investigated . 5 . 2 . 8 : Cofilin phosphorylation is modified by Pi3K inhibition Cofilin phosphorylation was explored in THP - 1 in the presence and absence of Pi3K inhibitors LY294002 ( LY ) 20 μM and AS605240 ( AS ) 5 μM . Cells were treated with inhibitors followed by CXCL12 or CCL3 at different concentrations , figure 5 . 18 . 137 Figure 5 . 18 : Western Blot with total - cofilin and phosphocofilin ( Ser3 ) antibodies reveals cofilin phosphorylation levels in THP - 1 following pre - treatment with AS605240 ( AS ) 5 μM or LY294002 ( LY ) 20 μM ( 37°C , 30 mins ) in presence and absence of CXCL12 , or CCL3 ( 0 . 5 , 1 or 5 nM , 15 mins before lysis ) . β - actin loading control . In THP - 1 at higher levels of chemokines ( 5 nM ) AS605240 continued to increase phosphorylation responses in presence and absence of chemokine whereas LY294002 decreased them . However in Jurkat the cofilin phosphorylation showed little response to Pi3K inhibition or CXCL12 stimulation , figure 5 . 19 , this may be due to differences between untransformed T - lymphocytes and Jurkat ( a T - cell lymphoma cell line ) with respect to Ras signalling . In Jurkat Ras fails to activate Pi3K [ 646 ] whereas in untransformed T - lymphocytes it can [ 647 ] .

As explained cofilin is able to modify the assembly and reorganisation of actin filaments , so the effects of the Pi3K inhibitors on actin fibres in CHO . CCR5 cells were examined using Phalloidin , figure 5 . 20 . ( A ) Control ( B ) AS605240 ( C ) LY294002 Figure 5 . 20 : Filament actin stains following Pi3K inhibition .

Imaged UV inverted microscopy ( Leica DMII Fluorescence microscope 500x Ex 490 nm , Em 520 nm ) . AS605240 or LY294002 show no adverse effects on actin filament structure , therefore these inhibitors effects on chemotaxis are unlikely to be due to destruction of the cell’s actin cytoskeleton . Modification of GRK , Src , ROCK , Raf and MEK signalling , using small molecule inhibitors , also influences chemotaxis of THP - 1 and Jurkat to CCL3 and / or CXCL12 , so the influence of these inhibitors on cofilin phosphorylation was examined . GRK activity is linked to the actions of β - arrestin , hence the effects of transfection of cells , with plasmids to increase or decrease β - arrestin levels , on cell migration were also explored . 139 5 . 2 . 9 : G - protein coupled receptor kinases ( GRKs ) GRKs are a family of protein kinases that can support malignancies ; they modulate survival , proliferation and invasion of cancers [ 648 ] . Activated chemokine receptors couple to G - proteins , enabling the exchange of GDP for GTP on the Gα subunit , which causes the Gα and the Gβ / Gγ dimers to dissociate and interact with downstream effectors such as adenylyl cyclase . This activation of the chemokine receptor causes the translocation of GRKs from the cytosol to the plasma membrane , and GRKs then phosphorylates serine / threonine residues on the receptor . This phosphorylation recruits β - arrestins ( a non - visual arrestin ) to the receptor . β - arrestins cause receptor desensitisation , that is uncoupling the chemokine receptor from the Gα and Gβ / Gγ G - proteins [ 649 ] . However , β - arrestins can also act as scaffolding proteins and mediate signalling and receptor internalisation [ 650 ] , hence GRKs influence the balance of β - arrestin and G - protein signalling [ 651 ] . 5 . 2 . 9 . 1 : βARK The original GRK identified was the enzyme which phosphorylates rhodopsin , now called GRK1 . Next , β - adrenergic receptor kinase ( βARK ) , an enzyme that could phosphorylate and desensitizes an agonist bound GPCR was discovered , βARK is now called GRK2 [ 649 ] . There are at least six GRK isoforms , and some isoforms are involved in malignant cell migration and apoptosis [ 652 ] . Here the effects of a specific βARK inhibitor , Methyl 5 - [ 2 - ( 5 - nitro - 2 - furyl ) vinyl ] - 2 - furoate ( β - ARK - 1 ) were explored , figure 5 . 21 .

CCR5 , figure 5 . 21 . The IC 50 of β - ARK - 1 is reported as 126 µM [ 653 ] , however this figure was derived from a βARK activation assay not a MTS or MTT toxicity assay . MTS assay results were deceptive with this highly coloured chromophore compound as they indicated inhibition of metabolism at low concentrations ( ~ 6 μM ) but not at high concentrations ( 190 μM ) , figure 5 . 22A . Therefore manual toxicity assays were undertaken , over 24 and 48 hours showed above ~ 3 μM produced inhibition of proliferation and at higher concentrations β - ARK - 1 produced cell death in Jurkat whereas in THP - 1 cells toxicity was relatively consistent across all β - ARK - 1 concentrations , figure 5 . 22B - E A Jurkat , MTS B Jurkat , Toxicity after 24 hours exposure C Jurkat , Toxicity after 48 hours exposure THP - 1 , Toxicity after 24 hours exposure THP - 1 , Toxicity after 48 hours exposure D E Figure 5 . 22 : Cytotoxicity assays for β - ARK - 1 .

This may relate to Pi3K being constitutively active in Jurkat [ 654 ] and important for Jurkat chemotaxis [ 565 ] , as Pi3K signalling can trigger nuclear location of Mdm2 , which then impedes Mdm2 E3 - ubiquitin ligase - mediated GRK2 degradation [ 655 ] . 5 . 2 . 9 . 2 : Ipyrimidine Ipyrimidine ( 4 - Amino - 5 - ethoxymethyl - 2 - methylpyrimidine ) is a relatively new small molecule inhibitor stated to target GRKs , but which GRK / s are not specified , and to - date there have been no publications detailing use of this inhibitor . Exploration of Ipyrimidine’s effects showed it to significantly inhibit chemotaxis in THP - 1 and Jurkat , figure 5 . 23 .

MTS assays using concentration up to 10 μM Ipyrimidine showed no evidence of significant cell toxicity in THP - 1 over 7 hours , but over 24 hours in MCF7 cells very significant inhibition of cell metabolism was observed even at 5 μM , figure 5 . 24 . The possibility that Ipyrimidine has off - target effects still needs exploring as another pyrimidine structure , 4 - amine - 5 - ( 4 - chlorophenyl ) - 7 - ( t - butyl ) pyrazolo [ 3 , 4 - d ] pyrimidine , reportedly inhibits Src kinase activity [ 553 ] , and both structures may be able to bind similar protein sites , as both contain a central pyrimidine , with an electronegative group on one side and aliphatic group on other , figure 5 . 25 . Although as Src purportedly phosphorylates and activates GRK [ 553 ] the end result may be the same .

GPCR overstimulation may cause cytotoxicity ; β - arrestin can act to desensitize receptors preventing G - protein - receptor association over the short term , and over a longer term receptors can be internalised and degraded [ 658 ] . β - arrestins may sequester RhoGEFs and RhoA in the cytosol producing compartment - specific regulation inhibiting spatial and temporal activities critical for cell migration [ 659 ] . Β - arrestin - 1 aka Arrestin - 2 , and β - arrestin - 2 aka Arrestin - 3 , are implicated in cancer and cell migration . Both arrestins are expressed in haematopoietic cells , and may modulate the Wnt / β - catenin signalling pathway in stem cell maintenance of leukaemia [ 660 ] . Arrestin - 2 in conjunction with Gα q / II influences RhoA - triggered stress - fibre formation and so actin remodelling [ 661 ] , and also some cancer derived cell - lines show raised Arrestin - 2 expression [ 662 ] . Arrestin - 2 may regulate Rho GTPases through RhoGAPs [ 663 ] and RhoGEFs [ 664 ] . Active Rac reportedly increases cofilin phosphorylation , and depletion of Arrestin - 2 is reported to cause reduced directional migration and cofilin phosphorylation in transfected HEK cells [ 665 ] . In leukocytes β - arrestins scaffold cofilin with phosphatases at membrane protrusions controlling location of actin filament severing [ 626 ] . 5 . 2 . 10 . 1 : Immunofluorescence demonstrates the presence of β - arrestins in cell - lines The presence of arrestins in cell - lines was demonstrated using immunofluorescent staining and UV microscopy , figure 5 . 28 .

CCR5 The immunofluorescent staining showed the cell - lines expressed arrestin - 2 . Plasmids , carrying GFP - tagged Arrestin - 2 , Arrestin - 3 or mutant Arrestin - 2 , were transfected into cells . These caused over - or in the case of the mutant dominant negative expression of arrestin , and so allowed the influence chemokines on the arrestin subtypes to be visualised and explored . The mutant arrestin - 2 ( β - arrestin - 1 - V53D ) has a valine substituted for an aspartic acid . It is understood to interact normally with GPCR but then fail to facilitate sequestration to endocytic pathways so the mutant inhibits normal β - arrestin binding , uncoupling the receptor , and mediating receptor desensitisation , sequestration and subsequent recycling and re - sensitisation [ 494 ] . The effect of CCL3 on arrestin - transfected CHO . CCR5 was explored first , figure 5 . 29 . THP - 1 MCF7 145 A . Arrestin - 2 eGFP plasmid transfects B . Arrestin - 2 eGFP transfects + CCL3 C .

Arrestin - 2 eGFP plasmids clearly respond to CCL3 whereas mutant Arrestin - 2 eGFP plasmids accumulate in the CHO’s nucleus , and transfects’ appearance is not altered in response to CCL3 treatment . 5 . 2 . 10 . 3 : β - arrestin transfections in MCF7 , THP - 1 and Jurkat Similar responses , redistribution into aggregates are seen in MCF7 cells transfected with the Arrestin - 2 eGFP plasmids then treated with CXCL12 or CCL3 ( arrowed ) , figure 5 . 30 , whereas after transfection with Arrestin - 3 eGFP plasmids dense areas were apparent both before and after chemokine addition ( arrowed ) , figure 5 . 31 . 146 ( A ) eGFP control ( B ) Arrestin - 2 transfects ( C ) Arrestin - 2 transfects + CCL3 ( D ) Arrestin - 2 transfects + CXCL12 Addition of CCL3 or CXCL12 concentrates Arrestin - 2 into cytoplasmic clumps .

In Jurkat which express CXCR4 , chemotaxis of cells transfected with mutant or active Arrestin - 2 eGFP plasmids suggests overexpression of Arrestin - 2 may very modestly positively modify migration towards CXCL12 compared to eGFP control plasmids , figure 5 . 33A . In THP - 1 transfections with Arrestin - 3 plasmids produced an increased migration towards both CCL3 and CXCL12 , whereas Arrestin - 2 plasmids only increased migration towards CXCL12 , however both are compared to mutant Arrestin - 2 plasmid transfection which may reduce migration , figures 5 . 33B and C . In MCF7 cells transfection with Arrestin - 2 again modestly significantly increases chemokinesis in the presence of CCL3 . Whereas Arrestin - 3 and mutant Arrestin - 2 plasmid 147 transfection did not increase wound - healing in response to CCL3 or CXCL12 . What is not known is if eGFP plasmids used as control aid or impede wound - healing , figure 5 . 34 . Overall response to overexpression of β - arrestins by plasmid transfection demonstrated both cell type and chemokine specific responses .

FAK is often upregulated in human malignancies , and potent , reversible , ATP - competitive FAK and PYK2 inhibitor PF562271 has undergone phase II trials in human pancreatic , head and neck , and prostate cancers , all solid tumours . Solid tumours usually consist of healthy stromal cells ( cancer - associated fibroblasts ) and cancer cells . Metastasis of the cancer cells , which can include malignant leukocytes , is to some extent controlled by adhesions between the healthy stromal cells [ 666 ] . T - cells also express both PYK2 and FAK which are involved in responses to chemokines [ 667 ] . When PYK2 and FAK are absent cells’ adhesion interaction with Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 ( ICAM1 ) is defective and T - cell responses fall as T - cells’ activation by antigen presenting cells is disrupted . PF562271 is reported to inhibit T - cell proliferation [ 668 ] . MTS assays found some inhibition of metabolism in THP - 1 but not Jurkat cells from PF562271 , negative effects on actin filament with concentration of actin filament to cells periphery were also apparent , figure 5 . 35 .

FAK phosphorylation on Tyr 397 creates a Src binding site , the Src / FAK complex can then phosphorylate focal adhesion components that influence cell adhesion dynamics , initiate signalling cascades and contribute to scaffolding [ 668 ] . Here the effects of FAK inhibitor - 2 ( aka PF - 573228 ) and PF562271 which both inhibit FAK Tyr 397 phosphorylation and so activation , were explored in THP - 1 and Jurkat chemotaxis assays . PF562271 also inhibits ATP phosphorylation of PYK2 directly possibly explaining its increased potency , although PF562271 and PF - 573228 are sulphonamides and have structural similarities , figures 5 . 36 - 5 . 38 .

Inhibiting FAK allows PYK2 to increase Rho GTPase activation and macrophage motility , and cell survival via PYK2 regulation of p53 gene . Hence FAK - selective inhibitors may increase tyrosine phosphorylation by PYK2 [ 669 ] , and inhibition of both proteins may be advantageous to hamper metastasis . FAK inhibition with PF562271 was found to inactivate ( phosphorylate ) cofilin in presence and absence of CXCL12 or CCL3 , figure 5 . 40 .

These results show in THP - 1 and Jurkat that FAK / PYK2 inhibition inhibits chemotaxis , but specifically to CXCL12 not CCL3 , and that in THP - 1 FAK / PYK2 inhibition causes cofilin phosphorylation in the presence and absence of CXCL12 or CCL3 . 5 . 2 . 12 : Rho Proteins Rho proteins are small GTPases of the Ras superfamily , including Rho A , B , C , D and E . Rho regulates actin stress fibres in cell - cell and cell - extracellular matrix environments . Cytoplasmic Rho switches between the active GTP - bound and inactive GDP - bound forms . Guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) activate Rho GTPase activating proteins , promoting GTP hydrolysis to GDP . Rho can also be maintained in its inactive form by nucleotide dissociation inhibitors . Rho targets Rho activated coiled - coil kinases ( ROCKs ) .

Rho is activated by many mediators including cytokines , and ROCK can also be activated by arachidonic acid [ 670 - 672 ] , discussed in chapter seven . 5 . 2 . 12 . 1 : Rho activated coiled - coil kinase ( ROCK ) ROCK is found in a cell’s uropodium and lamellipodium . ROCK aids contractions of the uropodia and ROCK inhibition impedes migration by removing the myosin light chain contractions stimulated by RhoA [ 673 , 674 ] . ROCK co - locates with the microtubule organising centres in the uropodia . Depolymerizing microtubules e . g . with Nocodazole , upregulates RhoA activity and interferes with cell polarity . Antimitotic Nocodazole , which disrupts microtubules by binding to β - tubulin and activates the JNK signalling pathway , was found to significantly inhibit chemotaxis of both THP - 1 and Jurkat to CXCL12 , but not THP - 1 to CCL3 , figure 5 . 41 .

Inhibitors of ROCK such as Y27632 are reported to inhibit uropodia retraction in monocytes [ 675 ] . Cofilin controls actin depolarisation ; Rac and Rho activate ROCK and PAK kinases that phosphorylate LIMK which then phosphorylates and inactivates cofilin [ 676 ] . Reportedly ROCK can activate LIMK 2 , by phosphorylating a LIMK2 ‘activation segment’ on residue threonine - 505 . LIMK2 can then phosphorylate cofilin . LIMK 1 activation may follow signalling through Rac1 and Pac1 , so LIMK1 and 2 are modulated by different kinases regulated by Rho GTPases [ 677 , 678 ] . However , in malignant cells ROCK may be mutated . Shortened constitutively active ROCK may be able to activate both LIMK1 and LIMK2 whereas full - length un - mutated ROCK specifically phosphorylates LIMK2 but not LIMK1 . This phosphorylation of LIMK2 by ROCK has been shown to be inhibited in COS - 7 cells by 10 μM Y27632 [ 678 ] , reportedly a highly selective inhibitor of ROCK .

Y27632 at concentrations between 1 and 5 μM dose dependently inhibited chemotaxis in Jurkat cells , and at 2 . 5 μM inhibited chemotaxis in THP - 1 . The observed effects on chemotaxis were not due to toxicity , figures 5 . 43 and 5 . 44 . Previous reports state that ROCK1 inhibition of NIH313 cells over 16 hours did not cause cofilin dephosphorylation [ 644 ] , however results may be cell - type or time specific . ROCK phosphorylates LIMK , which phosphorylates cofilin ; therefore inhibition of ROCK with Y27632 would be expected to prevent chemokines triggering cofilin phosphorylation .

Incubation with MEK inhibitor α - [ Amino [ ( 4 - aminophenyl ) thio ] methylene ] - 2 - ( trifluoromethyl ) benzeneacetonitrile ( SL327 ) even at a low concentration , 2 μM , increased cofilin phosphorylation compared to control , more than 5 nM of CCL3 or CXCL12 , figure 5 . 45 .

The results suggest MEK inhibition alone can influence cofilin phosphorylation in THP - 1 . MTS assays were used to check SL327 for toxicity in THP - 1 and Jurkat , then the effects of MEK inhibition with SL327 on chemotaxis in THP - 1 and Jurkat were explored , MTS assays found no evidence of SL327 inhibiting cell metabolism in THP - 1 and Jurkat but inhibition of MEK very significantly inhibited chemotaxis to CXCL12 and CCL3 , figures 5 . 46 and 5 . 47 .

The above investigations show CXCL12 , CCL3 and some other chemokines can increase cofilin phosphorylation in monocyte model THP - 1 , and also that phosphorylation levels can be modified by some small molecule inhibitors . CXCL12 triggered cofilin phosphorylation can be altered by Pi3K , ROCK and MEK inhibition . ROCK has been shown to phosphorylate and activate LIMK [ 633 ] . These results support the premise that G i - induced activation of MEK , Pi3K and ROCK signalling pathways are involved in the control of cofilin activity . Results with Gallein , βγ G - protein inhibitor , and GRK inhibitor Ipyrimidine suggest these upstream pathway proteins are also involved . Src activation can cause loss of actin stress fibres , focal contacts and loss of cofilin phosphorylation these changes can support metastasis [ 679 ] . Inhibiting Src with Bosutinib 5 μM in THP - 1 only slightly increased cofilin phosphorylation responses to CXCL12 , figure 5 . 48 . Whereas inhibiting MEK was found to consistently increase cofilin phosphorylation , possibly because cofilin dephosphorylation may require both active MEK and Pi3K .

To achieve this β - arrestin plasmid transfection and the various small molecule inhibitors shown with targets in figure 5 . 50 were employed . 157 Figure 5 . 50 : Major purported signalling pathways that modulate cofilin phosphorylation with inhibitors and protein targets . 5 . 3 . 1 : Cofilin phosphorylation and chemokinesis The above results indicate a relationship between cofilin Ser3 phosphorylation and chemokine stimulation of the cell - lines . Cofilin Ser3 dephosphorylation has been shown to occur seconds after chemotactic receptor activation in leukocytes [ 372 , 681 ] and in cytokine receptor stimulation re - phosphorylation can occur in 3 - 5 minutes [ 371 ] . Several investigations show active dephosphorylated cofilin translocates in leukocytes to their leading edge , supporting actin polymerization in lamellipodia . Cofilin inhibition using siRNA can inhibit formation of free actin barbed ends and monomers . In Jurkat actin dynamics at the leading edge appear heavily influenced by cofilin controlled by SSH and LIMK [ 370 , 682 , 683 ] . Here siRNA knockdown of cofilin was found to inhibit MCF7 chemokinesis supported by CCL3 and CXCL12 , figure 5 . 3 . Reduced Jurkat migration and lamellipodium formation has been shown to follow inhibition of LIMK cofilin phosphorylation and inhibition of SSH resulted in several lamellipodia formation and loss of directional migration ; hence cofilin activity appears essential to maintain a single directional leading edge , i . e . to support chemotaxis . In leukocytes and mammary tumour cells investigations show cofilin is an essential team player along with ARP2 / 3 complex and Formins ( Rho GTPase effector proteins supporting actin polymerization at barbed ends ) to enable actin polymerization and facilitate chemotaxis [ 370 , 372 , 684 ] . Here a clear relationship between chemokine stimulation in THP - 1 and cofilin phosphorylation was demonstrated , figure 5 . 4 , and γ α β P CXCL12 β γ FAK GRK P13K Cofilin LIMK ROCK Raf MEK Src Cofilin P Rho PP1 + PP2 PTEN ?

CXCL12 has previously been shown to synergise with CCL3 , increasing chemotaxis in dendritic cells possibly by augmenting CCL3 - triggered Akt or ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation [ 685 ] . Results here in THP - 1 show CCL3 and CXCL12 produced additive effects on chemotaxis , figure 5 . 7 . CXCL11 is an agonist for CXCR3 , CCL11 also binds CXCR3 acting as an antagonist . CXCR3 may act as a decoy receptor for CCL11 mopping up excess chemokine . CCL11 is an agonist at CCR3 , and CXCL11 acts as antagonist at CCR3 . CCL11 and CXCL11 may share overlapping binding sites on CCR3 extracellular loops ; this interplay may be essential for homeostasis fine tuning chemotactic responses [ 686 ] . The results here , figures 5 . 8 - 5 . 9 , suggest CXCL11 acts as an antagonist at CXCR4 with respect to calcium release in MCF7 and chemotaxis in THP - 1 and Jurkat . 5 . 3 . 3 : Pi3K , Phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 triphosphate ( PIP3 ) , Gβγ signalling and GEFs Pi3K is a key signalling protein mediating cell metabolism , growth , apoptosis as well as influencing actin - induced polarisation and changes in cytoskeleton arrangement [ 643 ] . Pi3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) aka PIP 2 producing phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate ( PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) aka PIP 3 . Guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) are also involved ; GEFs activate small GTPases by catalysing GTPase - GDP to GTPase - GTP , figure 5 . 51 . 159 Figure 5 . 51 : P13K and phosphatidylinositol - 3 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate signalling [ 638 , 643 , 646 , 687 , 688 ] . In immune cells the key controllers of levels of PIP 3 include Pi3K and the phosphatases , Phosphatase and Tensin homolog ( PTEN ) , which is a tumour suppressor , and SH2 - containing inositol 5 - phosphatase ( SHIP1 ) . PTEN is usually constantly active , but is often deleted or mutated in cancers [ 687 ] , whereas SHIP1 is activated by cell stimulation . In malignant cells PTEN may suppress cell proliferation whereas SHIP1 may reduce cell migration and activation . PTEN can downregulate Pi3K , Akt activity and SHIP1 , by degrading PIP 3 producing PIP 2 . Genes coding Pi3K / Akt pathway proteins can be mutated in cancers , including in breast malignancies and lymphomas , producing constitutively active Pi3K , this appears to be the case with Jurkat [ 646 , 688 ] . Also Jurkat are reported deficient in SHIP1 and PTEN , but express the substrate for both these phosphatases , PIP 3 , in high levels [ 688 ] . Such differences in phosphatase expression levels may be one reason why Pi3K inhibition , with Pi3K small molecule inhibitors AS605240 and LY294002 , produced very significant inhibition on CXCL12 chemotaxis in Jurkat but have a lesser effect in THP - 1 especially on CCL3 - induced chemotaxis , figures 5 . 12 - 5 . 13 . This may be because CXCL12 - but not CCL3 - triggered signalling is through Gβγ [ 638 ] . This was demonstrated here using the small molecule inhibitor Gallein which interrupts the interaction of Gβγ with Pi3K , figure 5 . 10 . Although small molecule inhibitors suggest signalling through Pi3K may be more relevant for CXCL12 than CCL3 stimulation of chemotaxis . Cofilin phosphorylation and siRNA knockdown in cell - lines suggested Pi3K is just as important in CCL3 chemokinesis , figures 5 . 15 - 5 . 19 . Indeed in P P P P P P P P13K PTEN SHIP1 Akt NF κ B Cell survival Cell growth Cell proliferation GEFs Cofilin Actin reorganisation Cell migration P ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 P ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 P ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 α βγ P CXCL12 160 THP - 1 cofilin phosphorylation was slightly increased in the presence of Gallein , figure 5 . 11 , possibly suggesting constitutively active signalling in THP - 1 through βγ , but the expected chemokine induced increased cofilin phosphorylation from CCL3 and CCL2 , seen in figure 5 . 4 , was reduced by pre - treatment with Gallein supporting the findings of the siRNA knockdown . Cofilin phosphorylation was explored in THP - 1 in the presence and absence of Pi3K inhibitors LY294002 and AS605240 and different concentrations of CXCL12 or CCL3 . Phosphorylation of cofilin was increased with both inhibitors compared to control at low levels of chemokine ( 0 . 5 and 1 nM ) , however low levels of chemokine alone were insufficient alone to cause cofilin phosphorylation to controls , figures 5 . 18A and 5 . 18B . Inhibition of Pi3K may reduce the concentration of chemokine necessary to cause cofilin phosphorylation as Pi3K / Akt signalling inhibits LIMK , which phosphorylates cofilin . Treatment with LY294002 or AS605240 , followed by CCL3 or CXCL12 at 5 nM produced the usual phosphorylation in controls , which was increased further by AS605240 but reduced by LY294002 figure 5 . 18C . Hence like the siRNA knockdown these results suggest Pi3K signalling may be equally important in both CCL3 and CXCL12 signalling in THP - 1 cells , but may also be Pi3K subtype specific . 5 . 3 . 4 : Cofilin links to mitogenic signalling networks The Ras - Raf - MEK - ERK signalling pathway can carry the signal from a chemokine stimulation of a GPCR to the cell’s nucleus . MEK is a tyrosine and threonine kinase also known as MAPKK . CXCL12 stimulation of Gαi through CXCR4 is thought to trigger Ras signals to MEK . LIMK1 downstream of MEK is then inhibited and cofilin dephosphorylation ( activation ) occurs [ 689 ] . Here inhibition of MEK with SL327 strongly inhibited chemotaxis and produced cofilin phosphorylation in presence and absence of CCL3 and CXCL12 , figures 5 . 45 and 5 . 47 . Inhibition of MEK may only inhibit leukocyte migration through three - dimensional ( 3D ) not two - dimensional ( 2D ) environments , possibly as on 2D surfaces leukocyte migration is based on the cells “walking” i . e . after extending a leading edge , the “back” of the cell then arches as the trailing edge or uropodia moves forward , resulting in movement similar to that seen in soft - bodied insect larva . Leukocytes migrate as single cells through many different tissues ; their mode of motility has considerable plasticity depending on their extracellular environment , for example movement along 2D endothelial linings compared to through 3D interstitial spaces . Leukocytes can switch motility mode rapidly [ 690 , 691 ] . Such 2D movement may not need actin tread - milling . Actin polymerization is needed for pseudopodia formation at the leading edge ; actin’s barbed ends push the cell membrane forward and cell adhesion between linker proteins Shootin1 and LI - CAM , and also between F - actin 161 and N - Cadherin , allow grip between cell and surface [ 691 ] . If these contracting cycles are inhibited , but cofilin is not , cells have been shown to produce lamellipodia to migrate . The lower the level of G - actin the more cells may depend on cofilin to move , thus MEK and active cofilin appear important in 3D migration , and cells can adapt their migratory mode to suit their external environment [ 633 ] . Neuro Probe ChemoTx® plates as used here to explore chemotactic responses may represent a useful model of a 3D system as the cells need to squeeze through the 5 uM pores . This is a similar situation to T - cells protrusions pushing through interstitial meshes and in both cases movement is towards a chemokine attractant . 5 . 3 . 5 : GRKs and β - arrestin in chemokinesis GRK2 is a serine threonine kinase with three key domains , a Regulator of G - protein Signalling Homology ( RH ) domain , a Central Catalytic domain and a lipid - binding Pleckstrin Homology ( PH ) . GRK2 can promote β - arrestin binding agonist - activated GPCRs halting the receptors’ activation of G - proteins [ 17 , 692 ] but also interact with many cytosolic and nuclear oncogenic signalling proteins such as Mdm2 , MEK , AKT and RhoA , [ 693 ] , for example GRK2 has been shown to inactivate p38 MAPK [ 694 ] . GRK2’s N - terminal and PH domains interact with Gβ / Gγ subunits [ 695 , 696 ] , and its C - terminal interacts with lipids or membrane proteins [ 652 ] . GRKs are also involved in G - protein independent signalling , such as GRK2 / β - arrestin signalling producing ERK activation [ 697 ] . Inhibition of ERK inhibits chemotaxis [ 698 ] which may explain why inhibiting GRK2 inhibitor β - ARK - 1 and Ipyrimidine both strongly inhibited CCL3 and CXCL12 chemotaxis , figures 5 . 21 and 5 . 23 . Different chemokines binding the same chemokine receptor can activate different GRKs promoting biased signalling , through either G - proteins or GRK / β - arrestin [ 699 ] , as different chemokines produce specific conformational changes that selectively recruit specific GRK subtype / s [ 700 ] . Different GRKs then phosphorylate differing serine / threonine residues on the GPCR . The phosphorylation pattern selects the response , either receptor desensitisation or signalling [ 701 ] . GRKs also interact directly with non - GPCR proteins [ 702 ] including cytosolic and nuclear proteins involved with cell migration [ 703 ] ; for example GRK2 interacts with MEK to negatively regulate ERK activated by CCL2 [ 704 ] . ERK triggered phosphorylation of GRK2 allows GRK2 location in mitochondria [ 705 ] and interaction with mitochondrial chaperone HSP90 [ 706 ] where it mediates the effects of cellular Ca 2 + fluxes on mitochondria [ 707 ] . GRK2 also phosphorylates tubulin [ 708 ] and is itself phosphorylated by CDK - 2 and can affect cell cycle 162 progression [ 709 ] . This may explain the cytotoxicity issues observed with both GRK inhibitors , figures 5 . 22 and 5 . 24 . 5 . 3 . 6 : β - arrestin mediation of signalling leading to chemotaxis and chemokinesis Agonist phosphorylation of GPCRs by GRKs reportedly triggers arrestin binding which sterically discourages G - protein interactions with GPCR , and thus uncouples G - proteins from the GPCR and terminates signalling [ 710 ] . Arrestin - 2 and Arrestin - 3 may facilitate GPCR internalisation through clathrin - mediated endocytosis , a pathway that can lead to receptors recycling back to the membrane rather than degradation [ 711 - 713 ] . However arrestin is reported to associate with E3 ubiquitin ligase which favours ubiquitination and degradation [ 714 ] ; such association has been demonstrated for CXCR4 [ 715 , 716 ] . Plasmid overexpression of Arrestin - 2 and Arrestin - 3 has been used by others to explore any preferences for receptors for arrestin - 2 or - 3 in this process , which purportedly involves β - arrestin binding to clathrin and AP2 proteins as well as other components of clathrin coated pits . Many early studies have shown β - arrestins can move with associated GPCR into early endosomes . Arrestin also hinders phosphatase access to GPCRs phosphorylated C - termini , and hence influences receptor re - sensitisation [ 493 , 717 ] . β - arrestins facilitate GPCR signalling via Src , ERK and p38 MAPK pathways [ 718 ] . MAPK signalling purportedly supports metastasis [ 719 ] . GPCRs can be classified as class A and B receptors , CCR5 is a class A and CXCR4 is a class B . Class A GPCRs preferentially associate with Arrestin - 3 over Arrestin - 2 , whereas class B receptors show no preference [ 710 , 720 , 721 ] . Results here in THP - 1 and Jurkat support these factors ; showing Arrestin - 3 may be more relevant for CCL3 - induced chemotaxis , likely to be mediated by CCR5 figure 5 . 33C , whereas both Arrestin - 2 and - 3 are relevant for CXCL12 - induced chemotaxis likely to be mediated by CXCR4 , figures 5 . 33A and 5 . 33B . However in MCF7 cells only Arrestin - 2 appears to support CXCL12 wound - healing , transfection with Arrestin - 3 or Arrestin - mutant plasmids may even impeded migration , figure 5 . 34 , suggesting cell - type specificity . For CCR5 - arrestin interactions to occur certain phosphorylation sites must be available [ 722 ] . CCR5 may only loosely bind β - arrestins whereas CXCR4 may bind more tightly [ 720 ] . This may modulate receptor fate [ 723 ] , potentially giving CCR5 a better chance of recycling and CXCR4 of degradation . However over - expression of Arrestin - 2 may be a negative biomarker in lung carcinoma [ 724 ] . 163 5 . 3 . 7 : ROCK and MEK are key mediators of cofilin phosphorylation Ras proteins are a family of small GTPases . Signalling from Ras proteins is involved in cell differentiation , survival and growth , hence over - expression of Ras is common in cancer ; the three Ras proteins in mammals N - Ras , H - Ras and K - Ras are all powerful oncogenes . Ras can signal to Raf , and to Pi3K . Src can also signal to Raf and Pi3K which can also be stimulated by G protein - coupled receptor kinase ( GRK ) . MEK can in turn inhibit Rho activated kinase ( ROCK ) , all these signalling cascades may be involve with cofilin phosphorylation [ 725 ] . ROCK inhibitor Y27632 was found to inhibit both chemotaxis and chemokine induced cofilin phosphorylation , figures 5 . 42 - 5 . 43 . Hence when MEK is inhibited cofilin is phosphorylated , figure 5 . 45 , and when ROCK is inhibited cofilin phosphorylation is prevented , figure 5 . 42 , suggesting both ROCK and MEK are key in chemokine induced cofilin phosphorylation . Further complexity is added to the picture by many other signalling pathways including those influencing the activity of LIMK1 and LIMK2 . 5 . 3 . 8 : FAK inhibition may support haematological malignancies FAK inhibition produced cofilin phosphorylation and inhibited chemotaxis . Others have noted that FAK inhibition can inhibit chemotaxis but support invadopodia formation in melanoma [ 726 ] . Invadopodia are actin - based protrusions that would require cofilin phosphorylation and f - actin formation . Hence although FAK / PYK2 inhibition with PF562271 was found to inhibit CXCL12 - induced directional migration , figure 5 . 38 , it produces cofilin phosphorylation , figure 5 . 40 , suggesting it potentially could support tissue invasion by haematological cancers in a similar way to that observed for melanoma . 5 . 4 : Conclusions Although Jurkat were only found to migrate to CXCL12 ; CCL2 , CCL3 , CCL4 , CCL5 , CCL23 , CXCL9 , CXCL11 and CXCL12 were shown to induce chemotaxis in THP - 1 . A Gaussian distribution chemokine concentration response curve was seen with THP - 1 to CCL3 and CXCL12 , and Jurkat to CXCL12 . In THP - 1 CCL3 with CXCL12 were found together to produce additive chemotactic responses whereas CCL2 with CXCL11 did not ; suggesting that chemokine chemotactic responses may be modulated by chemokine co - operation or antagonism . Western blot and immunofluorescence confirmed cofilin expression in THP - 1 , MCF7 and Jurkat . Chemokines CCL3 , CCL2 and CXCL12 were shown to increase cofilin phosphorylation in THP - 1 , and siRNA cofilin 164 knockdown confirmed cofilin is important in MCF7 chemokinesis . Results in THP - 1 support the conclusion that if a chemokine produces cofilin phosphorylation it may also be chemotactic . Also that cofilin phosphorylation can indicate the presence of a chemokines cognate receptor within a cell - line . Immunofluorescence and Western Blots demonstrated Arrestin - 2’s presence in THP - 1 macrophages Jurkat and MCF7 . Arrestin - 2 over - expression , compared to eGFP control , increased migration of Jurkat . Arrestin - 2 and Arrestin - 3 plasmids were seen to locate to cell cytoplasm , and possibly associate with organelles ; whereas Mutant - arrestin plasmids may target cell nuclei , possibly causing cytotoxicity . Chemokine addition produced plasmid aggregation possibly indicating Arrestin - 2 and 3 plasmids associate with receptors on endocytosis . In THP - 1 Arrestin - 3 , but not Arrestin - 2 , plasmid transfection increased chemotaxis to CCL3 , and both Arrestin - 2 and Arrestin - 3 plasmids increased chemotaxis to CXCL12 . However this was compared to dominant negative mutant plasmids which may themselves reduce migration . eGFP plasmid controls would have been better . In Jurkat Arrestin - 2 plasmid transfection , compared to eGFP plasmid controls , modestly increased chemotaxis to CXCL12 . In MCF7 only Arrestin - 2 , not Arrestin - 3 , plasmid transfection increased chemokinesis in presence of CCL3 . Overall arrestin results suggest cell and chemokine biases in Arrestin - 2 and Arrestin - 3 activity . GRK inhibition inhibited chemotaxis to both CXCL12 and CCL3 . GRK2 inhibitor , β - ARK - 1 , is a chromophore that is toxic to Jurkat and THP - 1 at higher concentrations over longer timescales , whereas GRK inhibitor Ipyrimidine lacks toxicity , but still inhibits chemotaxis to CCL3 and CXCL12 and cofilin phosphorylation , suggesting GRKs play a role in cofilin supported chemokinesis . siRNA knockdown and small molecule inhibition confirmed the importance of Pi3K to CXCL12 migration in all cell - lines and to a lesser extent CCL3 - induced chemokinesis in MCF7 and chemotaxis in THP - 1 . Indeed Pi3K inhibition in THP - 1 and Jurkat may increase cofilin phosphorylation in presence and absence of CXCL12 or CCL3 . FAK / PYK2 inhibition repressed chemotaxis to CXCL12 but not CCL3 in THP - 1 , and inhibited Jurkat chemotaxis to CXCL12 . It also caused cofilin phosphorylation in THP - 1 that was unaffected by CCL3 or CXCL12 , and modulated CXCL12 but not CCL3 calcium flux . Overall suggesting FAK / PYK2 play a key role in CXCL12 signalling and cofilin activity . 165 ROCK co - locates with microtubule organising centres ; Nocodazole , which depolymerizes microtubules , inhibits chemotaxis to CXCL12 but not CCL3 ; whereas ROCK inhibitor Y27632 strongly inhibits chemotaxis to both chemokines as well as preventing cofilin phosphorylation in THP - 1 . MEK1 / 2 inhibitor SL327 has the opposite effect increasing cofilin phosphorylation , but still significantly inhibiting chemotaxis to CXCL12 and CCL3 . Overall results suggested differential chemokine signalling through key cellular proteins such as Gβγ , Pi3K , FAK , MEK , Src and ROCK may modulate cofilin phosphorylation to influence chemotaxis . Having established above that phosphocofilin levels can be a useful readout tool in CXCL12 and CCL3 signalling , and that phosphocofilin levels can be modified by inhibiting proteins known to mediate CXCR4 / CXCL12 pathways ; next in chapter 6 cofilin phosphorylation along with chemotaxis assays were used to help to elucidate the somewhat controversial role of JAK2 and STAT3 proteins in CXCL12 / CXCR4 signalling . 166 Chapter 6 : JAK2 and STAT3 play role in chemokine - induced chemotaxis and cofilin phosphorylation 6 . 1 : Introduction CXCL12 binding CXCR4 can trigger Gαi signalling . This may involve signalling proteins termed ‘JAKs’ phosphorylating firstly the CXCR4 receptors tyrosines and then JAKs phosphorylating ‘STATs’ which are transcription factors which dimerize before translocating into the nucleus [ 323 , 727 , 728 ] . JAK2 gene mutations are common in malignancies [ 324 , 328 ] ; JAK2 mutations can enhance oncogenic responses to CXCR4 / CXCL12 signalling aiding cancer progression and metastasis ; by , for example , facilitating Pi3K signalling supporting chemotaxis [ 328 ] . Here the effects of JAK2 and STAT3 inhibition , with small molecule inhibitors , on chemokine induced chemotaxis were examined along with STAT3 phosphorylation in the context of cofilin activation . Active Rho GTPases , including Rac1 may be important for STAT3 transcriptional activity [ 729 - 731 ] . Phosphorylation by LIMK inactivates cofilin . LIMK may also negatively regulate STAT3 , through mediation of Myc expression [ 732 ] , overall suggesting chemokine triggered phosphorylation of cofilin may correlate with STAT3 phosphorylation . This piece of research elucidates the effects of JAK2 and STAT3 inhibition on cofilin and STAT3 phosphorylation induced by chemokines and the effects of JAK2 and STAT3 inhibition on cAMP production mediated by Forskolin , figure 6 . 1 . Figure 6 . 1 : The effects of JAK signalling , through Rho GTPases , and Forskolin on cofilin phosphorylation .

Aim : To discover if JAK2 and STAT3 inhibition affects MCF7 chemokinesis or THP - 1 chemotaxis to CCL2 or CXCL12 , then explore if any effects observed relate to phosphocofilin or cAMP levels in cells . Objectives : ( i ) Check small molecule inhibitors of JAK2 and STAT3 for cytotoxicity ( ii ) Explore the effects of JAK2 and STAT3 inhibition on THP - 1 chemotaxis to CXCL12 and CCL2 . ( iii ) Discover if inhibition of JAK2 or STAT3 modulates MCF7 chemokinesis supported by CCL2 or CXCL12 ( iv ) Investigate if JAK2 or STAT3 inhibition affects calcium dynamics in cell - lines ( v ) Use Forskolin to explore the effects of increased cAMP levels in MCF7 chemokinesis and THP - 1 chemotaxis and cofilin phosphorylation ( vi ) Examine the effects of JAK2 and STAT3 inhibition on cellular cAMP levels ( vii ) Examine the effects of JAK2 and STAT3 inhibition on cofilin and STAT3 phosphorylation in THP - 1 6 . 2 : Results Here the roles of JAK2 and STAT3 in chemokine induced chemotaxis or wound - healing , along with calcium responses in THP - 1 or MCF7 are explored along with the involvement of JAK2 and STAT3 in the temporally complex cofilin phosphorylation dynamics following CXCL12 stimulation ; also possible links between cofilin and STAT3 phosphorylation are examined . Next the roles of Forskolin and PKA inhibitor H89HCl individually on chemokine - induced chemotaxis and wound - healing are covered before using Forskolin as a tool in cAMP assays exploring the effects of JAK2 and STAT3 mediation of cAMP responses to CCL2 . Small molecule inhibitors employed here include JAK2 inhibitor II , Hexabromocyclohexane ( HBC ) , which binds a pocket adjacent to JAK2’s activation loop preventing JAK2 autophosphorylation [ 733 ] ; STAT3 inhibitor III , WP1066 , an AG490 tyrphostin analog that inhibits the STAT3 pathway , and STAT3 inhibitor VIII , 5 , 15 - Diphenylporphyrin ( 5 , 15 - DPP ) , which inhibits STAT3 dimerization via STAT3 SH2 domain and prevents STAT3 nuclear translocation . Blocking STAT3 phosphorylation consequently inhibits STAT3 c - myc promotor binding , reducing cellular c - myc protein levels [ 734 ] , figure 6 . 2 . 168 Figure 6 . 2 : JAK2 / STAT3 signalling from CXCR4 , and targets of inhibitors used . 6 . 2 . 1 : JAK2 and STAT3 inhibitors were examined for effects on cell metabolism and actin polymerisation MTS assays were used to establish inhibitor effects on cell metabolism in MCF7 and THP - 1 , figure 6 . 3 .

However Jurkat chemotaxis to CXCL12 was found not to be influenced by these three inhibitors , figure 6 . 7 , suggesting JAK and STAT3 involvement in chemotaxis has cell type specificity .

JAK2 and STAT3 inhibition had little effect on THP - 1 cells but appeared to stimulate CXCL12 - induced calcium release in MCF7 and Jurkat . Total calcium release was significantly greater in Jurkat , figure 6 . 9 , thus as with chemotaxis , the effect of the inhibitors on calcium dynamics was found to be cell - type specific .

Rodriquez et al . ( 2013 ) found PKA promoted JAK3 serine phosphorylation negatively regulating its catalytic activity and that 3 - isobytyl - 1 - methylxanthine ( IBMX ) had the same effect . IBMX is a broad spectrum phosphodiesterase inhibitor that prevents the breakdown of cAMP and cGMP [ 738 ] . Hence the effects on chemotaxis of manipulating cellular cAMP levels were assessed , followed by looking at JAK2 and STAT3 inhibition wrt intercellular cAMP levels . 6 . 2 . 4 . 1 : cAMP modulator Forskolin and PKA inhibitor H89HCL inhibit chemotaxis and chemokinesis Forskolin , a direct reversible activator of cAMP , is a diterpene derivative originally from the Coleus forskohlii plant and a useful tool for exploring the role of cAMP in cellular signalling . Forskolin induces a conformational change in the adenylyl cyclase ATP binding site , located close to the G αs subunit binding site , and results in more efficient cAMP synthesis [ 739 ] . Forskolin and phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as IBMX can elevate intracellular cAMP levels [ 740 ] . Forskolin increases intracellular cAMP levels several fold above baseline , this can interfere with expression of cell cycle regulatory genes [ 741 , 742 ] , so potentially inhibits cell proliferation and produces cell type specific responses . In the following investigations Forskolin and the PKA inhibitor H89 HCl were employed to explore the effects of modulation of cAMP and PKA levels on chemotaxis and wound - healing in THP - 1 and MCF7 respectively . PKA was of interest as cAMP negative regulation can occur through PKA [ 743 , 744 ] , and PKA may phosphorylate JAK2 [ 745 ] . No significant effects on cell proliferation , as measured by MTS assay , were seen with H89 HCl or Forskolin in THP - 1 or MCF7 cells , figures 6 . 10 and 6 . 11 .

These results show H89 HCl inhibition of chemotaxis is dose dependent , possibly due to off target effects of the inhibitor , as H89 HCl should inhibit Forskolin - induced protein phosphorylation . One possible off target effect of H89 HCl , which has an IC 50 of 135 nM for PKA , is ROCKII ( IC 50 ~ 270 nM ) [ 606 ] . In MCF7 Forskolin significantly reduced wound - healing stimulated by CXCL12 , whereas H89 HCl had no significant inhibitory effects .

JAK2 or STAT3 inhibition may reduce the steady fall in cAMP levels seen with controls following stimulation by CCL2 , the most prominent effects were recorded 20 minutes after stimulation but this did not reach significance . However the ratios of cAMP level with inhibitor treatment compared to cAMP levels after inhibitor and 20’ of CCL2 treatment illustrate that inhibition with HBC , WP1066 or 5 , 15 DPP all reduced the usual response to CCL2 compared to untreated control cells by nearly two fold . However with CXCL12 stimulation only JAK2 inhibitor HBC produced any significant loss in cAMP responses , figure 6 . 16B . 6 . 2 . 4 . 3 : cAMP levels may modulate actin filaments Most cell signalling is governed by reversible phosphorylation often via kinases .

Although H89 HCl is marketed as a selective inhibitor of PKA , H89 HCl has been shown to inhibit at least eight other kinases including ROCKII where H89 HCl was recorded as having an IC 50 of 0 . 27 μM in Sf9 cell transfects [ 606 ] . The effects of H89 HCl seen here may well therefore be off - target effects . ROCK inhibitor Y27632 , also inhibited CXCL12 induced migration in THP - 1 ( see Chapter 5 , figure 5 . 44 ) . ROCK is known to be involved in leading edge dynamics [ 746 ] possibly upstream of cAMP , hence the effects on actin fibres in the presence of Forskolin , H89 HCL and Y27632 and CCL3 or CXCL12 were explored . First the direct effect of Forskolin and H89 HCl on actin was examined using CHO . CCR5 , figure 6 . 17 .

CCR5 Forskolin produces considerable actin derangement of actin stress fibre responses to CCL3 treatment both at the cell boundary and intracellularly , H89HCl also caused actin clumping . cAMP addition itself has been observed in CHO cells to produce similar effects and loss of membrane architecture [ 747 ] . Phalloidin and DAPI stain in MCF7 pre - treated with Forskolin and H89HCl along with ROCK inhibitor Y27632 supported above findings in CHO . CCR5 , figure 6 . 18 .

Imaged UV inverted microscopy ( Leica DMII Fluorescence microscope 500x Ex 490 nm , Em 520 nm ) . The distinctive fine filaments and protrusions produced by chemokine stimulation in controls are mostly lost in the presence of Forskolin . MCF7 treated with Forskolin produced concentrated clumps of f - actin in the cytoplasm often near the cell boundary , which are modified by CCL3 or CXCL12 stimulation of cells . In H89 HCl treated MCF7 some actin bundles are apparent . ROCK inhibition with Y27632 again modifies the fine actin filament formation and as with Forskolin and H89 HCl treatment produced actin clumping but also encouraged the formation of long processes on the MCF7 in presence and absence of chemokines . PC3 are a prostate cancer cell - line , used here to compare cytoskeletal responses to pre - treatment with Y27632 , again ROCK inhibition produced elongation of cells , figure 6 . 19 .

A B C D E F G H I J K L A B 181 These results suggest the ROCK inhibitor does not destroy actin filament integrity but may modify ability of actin to branch and re - arrangement . Migration requires the maintenance of a polarized cell ; chemokines may trigger Rho GTPase signalling so modulation of actin and / or microtubules in the cytoskeleton . ROCK activity elevates stress fibre Myosin - II and affects microtubule assembly dynamics [ 748 ] . Y27632 by inhibiting ROCK and thus Myosin - II produces loss of stress fibres , and actin filaments at the leading edge , causes the cell edges to appear smooth , figures 6 . 18J - L . ROCK inhibition upsets cell polarization in these epithelial cell - lines causing cells to develop one , figure 6 . 19B , or multiple processes , this may explain how Y27632 inhibits cell migration . Forskolin and H89 HCl can be seen to disrupt the directional F - actin responses to chemokines , cAMP may be responsible . The inhibitory effects of cAMP on cell migration have also been observed in murine embryonic fibroblasts and murine breast tumour cells [ 749 ] . Overall Forskolin induced increases in cAMP were found to inhibit lamellipodia and membrane protrusion formation in MCF7 , and inhibit cell migration towards CXCL12 and CCL3 in THP - 1 , Jurkat and MCF7 , hence the effects of Forskolin on cofilin phosphorylation , a key player in leading edge dynamics was investigated next . 6 . 2 . 5 : Forskolin increases cofilin phosphorylation Forskolin is reported elsewhere to modulate profilin - 1 , which like cofilin is an actin - modulating protein , through PKA [ 750 ] and prevent agonist stimulated changes in cofilin phosphorylation [ 751 ] . Here the effects of THP - 1 pre - treatment with Forskolin 50 μM on cofilin phosphorylation in response to chemokine stimulation was examined , figure 6 . 20 . Forskolin was found to increased cofilin phosphorylation in the presence or absence of CCL3 or CXCL12 . Figure 6 . 20 : Total - cofilin and phosphocofilin ( Ser3 ) antibodies reveals cofilin phosphorylation levels in THP - 1 following pre - treatment with 50 μM Forskolin or DMSO control ( 37°C , 30 mins ) in presence and absence of CXCL12 or CCL3 ( 5 nM , 15 mins before lysis ) .

Cofilin phosphorylation in response to CXCL12 stimulation was recorded over a period of 30 minutes . In THP - 1 cofilin phosphorylation was found to be modified by CXCL12 over time , this temporal response was further modified by JAK2 and STAT3 inhibition . STAT3 III inhibition eliminated the phosphorylation seen in controls whereas JAK2 II inhibition reduced phosphorylation to a brief early response , and STAT3 VIII inhibition concentrated early phosphorylation responses to 5 minutes after cell stimulation , figure 6 . 21 .

STAT3 phosphorylation was seen in response to CXCL12 treatment after 10 and 30 minutes in control cells and in presence of STAT3 inhibition with WP1066 , this phosphorylation was completely lost in presence of 5 , 15 - DPP , and HBC . Cofilin phosphorylation was not altered by WP1066 but was lost with HBC whereas 5 , 15 - DPP produced cofilin phosphorylation after 10 minutes CXCL12 , figure 6 . 22A , similar to control in figure 6 . 22B .

STAT3 and JAK2 phosphorylation was also examined using ELISA , figure 6 . 23 . ELISA suggested that STAT3 phosphorylation initially rapidly decreases in THP - 1 stimulated by CXCL12 and that 5 , 15 - DPP and HBC significantly reduced basal phosphorylated STAT3 levels and non - significantly to CXCL12 responses at 10 minutes , concurring with Western blot , figure 6 . 22 . 184 THP - 1 Figure 6 . 23 : ELISA analysis of STAT3 phosphorylation .

JAK activation is required for Gαi association with GPCR upstream of PLC stimulated Ca 2 + mobilization , which itself is independent of Pi3K [ 728 ] . CXCL12 binds CXCR4 triggering receptor dimerization ; however JAK2 may have to be activated by autophosphorylation prior to docking with the GPCRs’ dimers . This docking involves JAK2 kinase phosphorylation of receptor tyrosines , and then Gαi - independent JAK2 activation by transphosphorylation , followed by the recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs including STAT3 . Also Gαi activation of tyrosine phosphatases , including Shp1 , may terminate CXCL12 stimulation of JAK / STAT signalling , but further tyrosine kinases may bind CXCR4 after JAK dissociation to extend CXCR4 signalling [ 323 , 753 ] . Soriano et al . ( 2003 ) concluded that JAK / STAT activation was essential for CXCL12 - induced G - protein activation , specifically JAK for Gαi activation and phospholipase - β ( PLC - β ) for calcium flux [ 728 ] . Mueller and Strange ( 2004 ) showed CCL3 triggered interaction of JAK2 with CCR5 in THP - 1 cells , and using HEK . CCR5 transfects found CCR5 ligand CCL3 could transiently enhance JAK2 phosphorylation and this was unaffected by PTX inhibition of Gαi or U73122 inhibition of phospholipase C . They also demonstrated Gαi , CCR5 and JAK2 protein association in inactive receptor complexes [ 754 ] . Mellado et al . ( 1998 ) examined the effects of MCP - 1 ( CCL2 ) in a monocytic cell line and concluded that CCL2 causes JAK2 to phosphorylate CCR2 tyrosine 139 triggering JAK2 / STAT3 Gαi - independent receptor association upstream of Gαi signalling [ 727 ] . Mellado then explored the relationship of JAK2 and CCR5 , concluding JAK and heterotrimeric G THP - 1 STAT3 phosphorylation following CXCL12 10 nM n = 3 26 . 06 . 16 C on t r o l C X C L 12 1 ' C X C L 12 5 ' C X C L 12 10 ' M  5 - 15 - D P P 10 C X C L 12 1 ' C X C L 12 5 ' C X C L 12 10 ' M  H B C 10 C X C L 12 1 ' C X C L 12 5 ' C X C L 12 10 ' 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 Control 5 - 15 - DPP 10  M HBC 10  M * * A b s o r b a n ce a t 450 n M 185 protein activation is JAK activation dependent [ 755 ] .

The above research shows that JAK / STAT signalling is important for CXCL12 and CCL2 chemokinesis in MCF7 and chemotaxis in THP - 1 , but not in Jurkat , figures 6 . 5 - 6 . 7 . Interestingly Khabbazi et al . ( 2013 ) found no effect of JAK2 or STAT3 inhibition on CCL3 induced chemotaxis in THP - 1 and that only STAT3 inhibitor III not STAT3 inhibitor VIII induced cell death [ 757 ] . Further experiments with the inhibitors used by Khabbazi et al . ( 2013 ) in THP - 1 and MCF7 cells were undertaken using CCL2 and CXCL12 to further elucidate JAK / STAT signalling complexities . Direct inhibition of STAT3 may induce cytotoxicity in a range of cancer cells suggesting these cells depend on STAT3 activation to thrive . JAK / STAT signalling is upregulated in some cancers including those of haematopoietic cells , with JAK inhibition sometimes the chosen therapeutic option [ 324 ] . 6 . 3 . 1 : JAK2 , STAT3 and cofilin phosphorylation Cytokines may trigger reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production by membrane NADPH oxidase complexes in some cell types . ROS may activate JAK / STAT pathway , Rac1 can regulate NADPH oxidase and active Rho GTPases and may be essential for STAT3 transcription activity [ 729 - 731 , 758 ] . More recent research also demonstrates a Rac1 pathway link to STAT3 . Inhibition of Rac1 using NSC23766 ( an inhibitor discussed in depth in chapter 8 ) or JAK2 using AG490 both reportedly reduced phosphorylation of STAT3 , this may be attributed to Rac1 inducing STAT3 activation through IL - 6 [ 759 ] . However Rac1 downregulates Myc via PAK2 phosphorylation , Myc is a multifunctional transcription factor , responsive to mitogenic signals , that activates expression of many genes [ 760 ] . Downregulation of Myc can be inhibited by ROCK inhibition using Y27632 , and downregulation of Myc increases cofilin phosphorylation , hence ROCK inhibition with Y27632 decreases cofilin phosphorylation and increases Myc . ROCK inhibition also reportedly upregulates STAT3 activity . Src and JAK2 kinases bind to and activate STAT3 , this has been inhibited with JAK2 and Src inhibitors , suggesting ROCK and LIMK negatively affect STAT3 via Src and JAK2 [ 732 ] . Here JAK2 and STAT3 inhibition was shown to disrupt cofilin phosphorylation in response to CXCL12 stimulation of THP - 1 , figure 6 . 21 , and have similar effects on STAT3 and cofilin phosphorylation following CXCL12 stimulation of THP - 1 , figure 6 . 22 . Cofilin orchestrates actin monomer and filament dynamics , and so cell motility , in response to chemotactic chemokines [ 761 ] . However chemotactic responses , and cofilin phosphorylation , 186 may be modified by metabolic environment stresses such as raised glucose or lipids . This has been shown to be the case for THP - 1 In the presence of normal glucose and lipid levels the addition of CCL2 produced a gradual increase in cofilin phosphorylation , although total cofilin levels were unaffected [ 384 ] . The cofilin phosphorylation responses shown here , to CXCL12 in THP - 1 , similarly increase but in a wave - like temporal fashion , figure 6 . 21A This phosphorylation can be disrupted by JAK2 or STAT3 inhibition supporting the hypothesis that both may be relevant to cofilin’s function in THP - 1 cell migration to CXCL12 . In a metabolic stress environment of raise cholesterol and glucose THP - 1 are reported to become sensitised to CCL2 ; a decrease in filament to globular actin ratio occurs , along with enhanced actin turnover , and decreased cofilin phosphorylation , producing increased migration of THP - 1 towards CCL2 [ 384 ] . Although it is possible that the inhibitors used here could cause cellular stress , this seems unlikely as they decrease migration towards CCL2 not increase it , figures 6 . 5 - 6 . 6 . 6 . 3 . 2 : cAMP involvement with JAK2 and STAT3 signalling cAMP is a second messenger that can be produced in response to stimulation of receptors , including chemokine receptors , via membrane associated adenylyl cyclase’s . Human cells can contain one soluble and up to nine adenylyl cyclase isoforms . These are purportedly variably expressed in different tissues and cellular compartments [ 739 ] . Adenylyl cyclase enzymatically converts ATP to pyrophosphate and 3’5’ cAMP [ 762 ] . cAMP then undergoes bond hydrolysis by phosphodiesterase’s to 5’AMP [ 763 ] . cAMP transfers signals from receptors to intracellular downstream effectors . cAMP is a negative regulator in immune cells through the protein kinase A ( PKA ) pathway . Protein phosphorylation is a fundamental regulatory mechanism in signalling and enzymes catalysing protein phosphorylation , protein kinases , are key in signal transduction , PKA is one such protein kinase . PKA is a serine / threonine kinase containing a four subunits , two catalytic and two regulatory [ 743 , 744 ] . PKA has been shown to phosphorylate JAK2 , this may occur via Src and Rac1 , and STAT3 via Pi3K [ 745 ] . PKA inhibition itself , with H89 HCl , was shown to inhibit chemotaxis , figures 6 . 12 - 6 . 13 , but little or no effect on chemokinesis , figure 6 . 15 . cAMP may produce responses in four ways ; ( i ) activation of exchange factors Epac1 and Epac2 ; ( ii ) cAMP gated ion channels ; ( iii ) cAMP - mediated phosphodiesterase’s ; and ( iv ) via catalytic PKA activation , which affects a range of cellular processes . In some cell types the balance between RAS / RAF / MEK / ERK and cAMP signalling maintains healthy homeostasis between cell differentiation and proliferation [ 735 , 743 , 764 ] . 187 Forskolin reportedly may negatively regulate JAK3 or PKA activity , PKA may directly phosphorylate and inactivate JAK3 [ 735 ] . JAK / STAT signalling can be negatively regulated by ( i ) suppressing cytokine signalling , ( ii ) protein kinase phosphatases and ( iii ) by protein inhibitors of activated STATs inhibiting JAK / STAT signalling directly [ 765 ] . Other signalling proteins and pathways such as MAPK , Pi3K and cAMP are also involved [ 766 ] . ATP is converted to 3’5’ - cAMP and pyrophosphate by membrane enzyme adenylate cyclase [ 762 ] . Phosphodiesterases then hydrolyse the phosphodiester linkage producing 5’AMP [ 763 ] . cAMP acts through several mediators including the serine / threonine kinase PKA [ 744 ] . Forskolin and phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as IBMX increase levels of cAMP [ 767 ] and cAMP levels may affect JAK / STAT signalling [ 768 ] hence Forskolin activation of adenylate cyclase , cAMP and PKA may inhibit JAK / STAT signalling [ 735 ] . Forskolin can increase intracellular cAMP several fold above normal . This may antagonise expression of cell cycle regulatory and checkpoint genes [ 741 , 769 ] so potentially inhibit cell proliferation , however this may not be applicable to cancer cell lines where cell cycle checkpoints may no longer be functional . Certainly Forskolin did not show any obvious toxicity in above assays , figure 6 . 10 , but inhibited chemotaxis and chemokinesis , figures 6 . 13 - 6 . 14 . Rodriguez et al . ( 2013 ) concluded JAK3 could be inhibited by a Forskolin - cAMP - PKA pathway through serine residues negatively regulating JAK3 catalytic activity . Also that treatment with non - specific phosphodiesterase IBMX may trap cells in Go phase and prevent JAK3 catalysing the phosphorylation of STAT5 [ 735 ] . Calcium mobilisation purportedly activates adenylate cyclase that produces cAMP [ 770 - 772 ] . The results here indicate cross talk may occur between cAMP / PKA and JAK2 / STAT3 signalling , suggesting that Forskolin’s negative effect on CXCL12 chemotaxis may be through interfering with JAK - mediated stability of CXCR4 receptor dimerization or that PKA could phosphorylate JAK serine residues and negatively regulate its catalytic functions . The inhibitory effects of Forskolin on chemotaxis and wound - healing , may be due to the increased cAMP levels . Others have noted in breast cancer cell line MDA - MD - 231 that increasing cAMP inhibits wound - healing . Research shows this can be attributed to abrogated STAT3 and ERK1 / 2 activation , along with inhibition of FAK phosphorylation . FAK is a tyrosine kinase scaffolding and phosphorylating protein that acts , along with integrins , in focal adhesion complexes [ 773 ] . FAK inhibition itself was shown to inhibit CXCL12 - induced cell migration ( chapter 5 figure 5 . 37 and 5 . 38 ) . FAK expression may be upregulated in malignant cells [ 774 ] such as MCF7 . An invasive phenotype can be produced by Src - FAK - p130 CAS complex formation . p130 CAS is a docking protein regulating FAK signalling to Rac1 . FAK may signal through p130 CAS to Rac1 , Rac1 activation inhibits Rho signalling . Inhibiting Rho kinase ( ROCK ) with Y27632 may allow FAK stimulation of Rac1 188 signalling to predominate [ 775 ] . Rho activation can cause bundling of actin filaments into stress fibres , whereas activation of Rac can cause formation of long slender filopodia and lamellipodia [ 776 ] as seen in figure 6 . 18 . PP2A is a serine - threonine phosphatase that may be present in malignant cells in lower levels than normal cells , present at normal levels , or present in a hyper - phosphorylated state . Hyper - phosphorylation makes PP2A inactive by preventing it forming the active phosphatase an heterotrimeric catalytic complex . PP2A in addition to catalysing cofilin dephosphorylation and activation can also act as a tumour suppressor reducing AKT and ERK phosphorylation and signalling . In addition to raising cellular cAMP levels Forskolin can dephosphorylate PP2A . If hyper - phosphorylated PP2 is dephosphorylated , it is activated [ 777 ] . PP1 and PP2 purportedly dephosphorylate cofilin . However these results indicate that at the concentrations used ( 50 μM ) Forskolin has effectively increased cofilin phosphorylation , suggesting that PP2A if present in THP - 1 cells it is not hyper - phosphorylated and may have been inactivated by the Forskolin treatment , figures 6 . 20 and 6 . 24 . Figure 6 . 24 : Forskolin may produce cofilin phosphorylation in THP - 1 by inhibiting PP2 [ 777 ] . Overall results point to a relationship between the phosphorylation of cofilin in response to CXCL12 and JAK2 / STAT3 signalling . LIMKs are modulated by Rho GTPases , they receive signalling from RhoA and RhoC and are phosphorylated and activated by ROCK producing linear actin , whereas actin branching , and lamellipodia , are mediated by Rac GTPases via p21 - activated kinases ( PAK ) . Rac1 activates LIMKs , including LIMK1 and LIMK2 . LIMK can reportedly negative regulates not only cofilin but also STAT3 and Myc [ 732 , 778 ] . Downstream of ROCK , LIMK and Rac1 negatively regulate Myc , Rac1 through PAK2 - mediated phosphorylation and LIMK via cofilin phosphorylation [ 779 ] . Rho GTPases can mediate Myc , and Myc down - regulation negatively correlates with cofilin phosphorylation . Also cofilin knockdown with siRNA can reduce Myc expression [ 732 ] . Hence ROCK , LIMK and cofilin can reduce Myc levels , and ROCK can increase phosphorylation of cofilin via downregulation of Myc . Src and JAK2 kinases bind and activate cofilin cofilin Slingshot LIMK 1 + Rho GTPases LIMK 2 PP2 Forskolin 189 STAT3 ; STAT3 also targets Myc [ 780 , 781 ] . ROCK and LIMK can decrease levels of phosphorylated ( active ) STAT3 by decreasing Myc , but this decrease can be dependent on Src or JAK2 [ 732 ] . Overall this suggests the phosphorylation of cofilin may relate to or correlate with STAT3 phosphorylation , figure 6 . 25 . Figure 6 . 25 : Signalling that may link STAT3 , JAK2 and cofilin phosphorylation [ 732 , 780 , 781 ] . The involvement of JAK2 in chemokine signalling has produced diametrically opposed debate [ 782 ] , and has indicated that JAK2 is not essential in CCL3 - induced chemotaxis [ 757 ] . However JAK / STAT signalling may be cell type or chemokine specific . Research by others has also shown CXCL12 to induce JAK - STAT signalling , and that inhibition of JAK2 may block CXCL12 - stimulated JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation and prevent the binding of GTP to RhoA stimulated by CXCL12 [ 783 ] . The inhibitor HBC binds the kinase domain of JAK2 inhibiting tyrosine kinase auto - phosphorylation . WP1066 inhibits the STAT3 pathway but also JAK2 , although WP1066 inhibition of JAK2 may be less than that achieved by the specific JAK2 II inhibitor HBC . HBC and WP1066 causes a dramatic change in cofilin phosphorylation compared to control , figure 6 . 21 , that is not seen with the STAT3 VIII inhibitor DPP , suggesting JAK2 may directly or indirectly influence LIMK activity to stimulate cofilin phosphorylation . This may be through Rho associated protein kinase , as inhibition of ROCK using Y27632 also inhibits cofilin phosphorylation , ( chapter 5 , figure 5 . 42 ) . Rac1 may also activate STAT3 , as inhibition of Rac1 using NSC23766 , ( an inhibitor discussed in chapter 8 ) and JAK2 with AG490 both reportedly reduced phosphorylation of STAT3 ; IL - 6 stimulating Rac1 to activate STAT3 [ 759 ] . JAK2 inhibitor HBC also eliminated STAT3 phosphorylation , figure 6 . 22 .

Others have also concluded cross - talk between JAK2 and the CXCR4 / CXCL12 co - operate to increase chemotactic responses in malignant hematopoietic cells through Pi3K signalling , and that chemotaxis is reduced in JAK2 inhibition [ 328 ] . Here results in THP - 1 and MCF7 cells support their findings and further demonstrate that STAT3 may be involved . Perez - Rivero et al . ( 2013 ) also implicated JAK2 signalling in CXCL12 chemotaxis in leukocytes ( in mice ) and linked this to F - actin polymerization [ 784 ] . Early work implicated JAK / STAT signalling in EMT , concluding Gαi association with GPCR is JAK activation dependent and that phospholipase C activity is downstream of JAKs [ 728 ] . Here results further elucidate the relationships between cofilin phosphorylation and JAK2 / STAT3 signalling . 6 . 4 : Conclusions In THP - 1 JAK2 and STAT3 inhibition can modify the usual temporal cofilin phosphorylation responses to CXCL12 , this appeared not due to inhibitor cytotoxicity . JAK2 and STAT3 inhibition can in a cell - and chemokine - specific manner significantly reduce chemotaxis and chemokinesis . Increasing cAMP levels appear to inhibit both CXCL12 and CCL3 chemotaxis in THP - 1 and chemokinesis in MCF7 . Also JAK2 may support intracellular cAMP falls in responses to CXCL12 signalling in THP - 1 . Overall results provide considerable evidence of JAK2 and STAT3 involvement in CXCL12 and CCL2 supported cell migration in both cell - lines . With CCL3 - induced migration in THP - 1 higher concentrations of H89 HCl were required to significantly inhibit migration , at this higher concentration H89 HCl may also be inhibiting ROCK11 kinase as well as PKA . Both H89 HCl and ROCK inhibitor Y27632 were found to disrupt actin filament formation , with Y27632 especially producing elongated lamellipodia , possibly due to ROCK inhibition producing Rac over Rho signalling predominance . Forskolin also disrupted the fine actin filaments produced in response to chemokines , instead actin bundles were present . Forskolin also inhibited chemotaxis and chemokinesis , plus produced increased phosphorylation of cofilin , suggesting cAMP levels influence lamellipodia and membrane protrusion formation and so cell migration in THP - 1 and MCF7 . Some tenuous correlation was observed between early STAT3 phosphorylation and cofilin phosphorylation produced in response to CXCL12 in THP - 1 . Both were somewhat similarly modified by JAK2 or STAT3 inhibition , further work is needed to clarify if STAT3 and cofilin 191 phosphorylation are related , if both involve JAK2 or STAT3 , and if this phosphorylation occurs in a cell - or chemokine - specific manner . Cofilin may mediate inflammatory factors through the JAK / STAT pathway [ 785 ] thus posing the question do anti - inflammatories such as COX inhibitors mediate cofilin phosphorylation , or indeed CXCL12 or CCL3 chemotaxis , answering these questions was the challenge addressed in chapter 7 . 192 Chapter 7 : Direct and indirect effects of NSAIDs in chemotactic metastasis 7 . 1 : Introduction The NSAIDs Ibuprofen , Naproxen and Celecoxib along with Paracetamol and Aspirin , are widely prescribed analgesics . NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase enzymes COX1 or COX2 that catalyse the production of prostaglandins , including prostaglandin E 2 ( PGE 2 ) [ 414 ] . Aspirin , Ibuprofen and Naproxen inhibit both COX enzymes whereas Paracetamol has diverse modes of action including COX2 inhibition [ 419 - 421 ] . Celecoxib is a specific COX2 inhibitor ; the inflammation that accompanies cancer can induce COX2 activity [ 411 ] . PGE 2 can suppress leucocyte activity causing immunosuppression [ 438 ] . PGE 2 may stimulate cancer initiation , proliferation survival and metastatic spread [ 439 ] . NSAID therapy may reduce cancer incidence for example by inhibiting progression of dysplasia to cancer [ 786 ] , which some chemokines support [ 787 ] . COX2 - produced PGE 2 expressed by tumours can inhibit apoptosis , promote proliferation and support metastasis [ 453 , 464 , 465 ] . NSAIDs’ off - target effects can also be therapeutic in malignancy . Celecoxib can cause cell cycle arrest [ 478 ] and activate apoptosis [ 480 , 481 ] . NSAIDs can also modulate calcium ATPases and Ca 2 + dynamics so favourably inhibiting EGFR , Pi3K - Akt and Raf - MEK - ERK signalling often corrupted in cancer [ 467 - 469 , 487 , 788 - 790 ] . Chapters 4 and 5 of this thesis show that CXCL12 - and CCL3 - induced chemotaxis also involves Pi3K - Akt and Raf - MEK - ERK signalling . This suggested NSAIDS may affect chemotaxis and even cofilin phosphorylation . This chapter reports investigations into the effects of various NSAIDs and Paracetamol on CCL3 and CXCL12 - induced cell migration in THP - 1 , Jurkat and MCF7 , and some preliminary work on NSAID mediation of cofilin phosphorylation in THP - 1 , figure 7 . 1 .

Aim : To investigate if NSAIDs affect CCL3 or CXCL12 - stimulated THP - 1 or Jurkat chemotaxis or MCF7 chemokinesis , and if effects can be related to cellular levels of cAMP or phosphorylated cofilin . Objectives : ( i ) Select a range of NSAIDs and check for cytotoxicity ( ii ) Examine NSAIDs for effects on CXCL12 - chemotaxis in THP - 1 and Jurkat and CCL3 - chemotaxis in THP - 1 ( iii ) Investigate if NSAIDs mediate CCL3 or CXCL12 - supported chemokinesis in MCF7 ( iv ) Use Phalloidin stains to probe NSAIDs effects on actin filaments ( v ) Explore the effects of NSAIDs on cellular cAMP levels following chemokine stimulation ( vi ) Observe if NSAIDS effect cofilin phosphorylation following CCL3 or CXCL12 stimulation 7 . 2 : Results Here the effects of Ibuprofen , Naproxen and Celecoxib along Paracetamol and Aspirin on chemokine induced migration , cAMP release and calcium responses was explored in THP - 1 and / or Jurkat and cofilin phosphorylation in THP - 1 . Concentrations of the drugs used are those reached by therapeutic doses [ 795 , 796 ] . Please note controls are common between graphs where experiments were conducted simultaneously ; results for each inhibitor have been displayed separately for ease of description of results , this applies to : figures 7 . 7B and 6 . 17C ; 7 . 6B and C ; 7 . 10B and C ; 7 . 11A and 5 . 27A ; 7 . 12B and C ; 7 . 18C and 4 . 11A ; 7 . 21A and 6 . 16A . 7 . 2 . 1 : Aspirin and Naproxen Aspirin , which has been attributed with cancer preventative properties [ 797 ] , very significantly inhibited chemotaxis to CXCL12 in THP - 1 ( p < 0 . 001 ) , and to a lesser extent in Jurkat ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Whereas Aspirin had no significant effect on CCL3 - induced chemotaxis in THP - 1 , figures 7 . 2 . 194 THP - 1 Jurkat THP - 1 A B C Figure 7 . 2 : Chemotaxis assays following pre - treatment with Aspirin 555 μM or control .

Others have examined the IC 50 of ibuprofen by other methods , for example Akrami et al . ( 2015 ) , using an adenocarcinoma gastric cell line , found an IC 50 of 630 μM by trypan blue staining and 456 μM by neutral red uptake assays over 24 hours ; these values fell to 549 μM and 408 μM respectively over 48 hours [ 798 ] . Ibuprofen is a racemic mix , in vivo the R - enantiomer is extensively converted to the S - enantiomer which is more pharmacologically active [ 799 ] . It is not clear if this conversion occurs in THP - 1 , Jurkat or MCF7 in vitro .

Ibuprofen’s reported therapeutic benefits in cancer may partly relate to its inhibition of cell migration [ 801 ] , and so the effects of Ibuprofen on chemotaxis in Jurkat and THP - 1 and wound - healing in MCF7 were explored , figures 7 . 9 .

Monocytes are reported to express EP receptors , mainly EP2 and EP4 , these may modulate monocyte responses via CCR5 to CCL3 and via CXCR4 to CXCL12 respectively as EP2 and EP4 agonists are reported to increase chemotaxis to CCL3 and CXCL12 [ 802 ] ; this may be why NSAIDs inhibit chemotaxis to these two chemokines in monocyte cell - line THP - 1 . Ibuprofen may exert its anti - tumour effects through inhibiting cell apoptosis or proliferation . Assays in MCF7 undertaken in the absence of serum to prevent proliferation demonstrated significant inhibition of migration - induced wound - healing produced by CXCL12 and CCL3 in cells exposed to ibuprofen 290 μM . MTS assays in MCF7 over 26 hours at 290 μM did show significant inhibition of cell metabolism , although wound - healing imaging revealed no evidence of cell death , figure 7 . 10 .

Celecoxib can modulate the expression of many genes involved in cell metabolism , proliferation , energetics , and apoptosis [ 803 ] . Celecoxib at low concentrations ( 10 μM ) is reported to work synergistically with calcitrol ( vitamin D ) to inhibit proliferation of MCF7 in vitro , both drugs were thought to be targeting COX2 [ 804 ] . Celecoxib is also reported to inhibit 3 - phosphoinositide - dependent kinase 1 ( PDK - 1 ) , one of the proteins that phosphorylate Akt [ 805 ] . Celecoxib but not Rofecoxib , another COX2 inhibitor , can at nanomolar concentrations , cause inhibition of some carbonic anhydrase isoforms [ 806 ] . Carbonic anhydrases support pH and CO 2 homeostasis by catalysing the conversion of CO 2 to the bicarbonate ion and hence mediate transport of CO 2 / HCO - 3 between lungs and metabolising / respiring tissues . Many cellular processes are influenced including bone reabsorption and calcification , gluconeogenesis , lipogenesis and tumourigenicity [ 807 ] . Certain carbonic anhydrases such as tumour - associated isoform hCA 1X are implicated in cancer cell development and invasion [ 808 ] . MTS assays indicated Celecoxib at 50 μM very significantly inhibits MCF7 cell proliferation , this cytotoxicity could explain the inhibition of wound - healing induced by CCL3 or CXCL12 in MCF7 , figure 7 . 12 . 200 A MCF7 B MCF7 C MCF7 Figure 7 . 12 : ( A ) Cytotoxicity assays for Celecoxib .

MTS assays allowed calculation of Celecoxib’s IC 50 in THP - 1 ( 54 μM ) and Jurkat ( 48 μM ) , figure 7 . 13 , yet even at 50 μM celecoxib did not inhibit chemotaxis of THP - 1 to CXCL12 or CCL3 or Jurkat to CXCL12 , figure 7 . 14 .

Paracetamol inhibits COX2 more than COX1 , and may reduce COX2 activity by 80 % in monocytes [ 422 , 423 ] so its effects on chemotaxis in THP - 1 and Jurkat were explored . 7 . 2 . 4 : Paracetamol Paracetamol is reported to have increased apoptosis , possibly through both the death receptor and mitochondrial pathways , and decreased caspase 9 expression in two colon - cancer cell lines [ 810 ] .

Chemotaxis assays explored the effects of Paracetamol at 130 μM on chemotaxis with THP - 1 to CCL3 and CXCL12 along with Jurkat assays to CXCL12 .

Calcium dynamics are central to the oncogenesis , deregulation , proliferation and resistance to apoptosis that defines malignancy , as cellular Ca 2 + concentrations and fluctuations can modulate signalling pathways [ 811 ] . Expression of calcium v1 . 2 L - type calcium channels , Voltage Gated Calcium Channels ( VGCC ) in THP - 1 is increased by their differentiation into macrophages [ 812 ] , although THP - 1 also operate via receptor and Store Operated Calcium Channels ( SOCC ) [ 813 ] .

TRPV1 channels reportedly contribute to Ca 2 + signalling triggered proliferation in MCF7 [ 815 ] . Calcium levels in cell cytosol are approximately 10 , 000 times lower in resting conditions than levels in the ER and other Ca 2 + stores . This gradient is created by Ca 2 + pumps in the stores’ plasma membranes . Both VGCC on calcium store membranes and cell Receptor - Operated Calcium Channels ( ROCC ) can potentially respond to signalling causing cytosol calcium influx [ 816 ] . Ca 2 + fluctuation can themselves trigger other calcium release channels controlled by inositol - 1 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate and ryanodine receptors located on the ER membrane . This generates further Ca 2 + movements [ 817 , 818 ] . Here the effects of Paracetamol treatment of THP - 1 , CHO .

Paracetamol at 130 μM was found to significantly decrease calcium responses to CCL3 in CHO . CCR5 cells , and conversely to significantly increase calcium release in response to CXCL12 in Jurkat . The effects observed with Paracetamol suggest cell type and chemokine specific responses . Others have observed a slight increase in calcium responses in Jurkat after treatment CHO .

Next the effects of Ibuprofen and Celecoxib on chemokine - induced calcium flux were explored , figure 7 . 19 .

Rather than reduce calcium flux Ibuprofen significantly increased both the speed and peak levels reach in all three cell types , although the smaller increase seen in Jurkat was not statistically significant . Celecoxib also increased calcium flux . Some NSAIDs may mediate apoptosis in malignant cells partly through effects on intracellular calcium concentrations . Celecoxib inhibits both calcium uptake and Ca 2 + ATPases ( aka SERCAs ) . Calcium enters the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) through Ca 2 + ATPases , and Celecoxib inhibits this calcium uptake causing calcium mobilisation and elevation [ 487 ] . Calcium levels can affect apoptosis . Celecoxib may trigger apoptosis via inhibiting signalling via ERK and Akt , both pathways support cell survival [ 821 ] . Ca 2 + rise may activate calcium - dependent proteases , endonucleases and calcineurin , all of which can induce apoptosis . Raised Ca 2 + levels facilitate Ca 2 + infiltration of mitochondria , causing cytochrome C release , which activates caspases causing apoptosis [ 822 , 823 ] .

Here the effects of Celecoxib , Ibuprofen and Paracetamol on cAMP levels before and after CCL2 treatment were examined . THP - 1 cells were treated with the drugs in the presence of phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX 0 . 75 mM with or without 10 nM CCL2 stimulation for periods varying from 1 to 20 minutes , figure 7 . 21 .

Paracetamol and Celecoxib reduced basal cAMP levels , but not the fall in cAMP levels over 1 to 20 minutes in THP - 1 subject to 10 nM CCL2 stimulation , figure 7 . 21B . Reduction in basal cAMP levels were statistically significantly with Celecoxib ( p < 0 . 01 ) and Paracetamol ( p < 0 . 05 ) but not with Ibuprofen ( p > 0 . 05 ) , suggesting observed effects may relate more to COX2 than COX1 inhibition . Although cAMP levels at 20 minutes post CCL2 treatment were slightly higher than control in the presence of all three drugs , the increases did reach statistical significance . 7 . 2 . 7 : NSAIDs and Paracetamol modulated cofilin phosphorylation Cofilin phosphorylation in response to CCL3 and CXCL12 was examined in THP - 1 cells pre - treated for 30 minutes with Celecoxib , Aspirin , Naproxen , Paracetamol or Ibuprofen , figure 7 . 22 .

( D ) THP - 1 pre - treated with Naproxen 217 μM ( 37°C , 30 mins ) then CCL3 ( 5 nM , 15 mins ) . Arrestin - 2 loading controls . Cofilin phosphorylation usually follows treatment with CCL3 or CXCL12 in THP - 1 , as discussed in chapter five , see figure 5 . 4 . Celecoxib , Naproxen , Aspirin and Paracetamol eliminated the expected phosphorylation from CCL3 or CXCL12 treatment whereas Ibuprofen consistently produced cofilin phosphorylation in presence and absence of CCL3 or CXCL12 , figure 7 . 22 . 208 7 . 3 : Discussion Aspirin , Paracetamol and NSAIDs Ibuprofen , Naproxen and Celecoxib were found to have drug and / or cell - line specific effects on chemotaxis , chemokinesis , calcium flux , cAMP production and cofilin phosphorylation in response to chemokines . 7 . 3 . 1 : Ibuprofen may have PGE 2 - independent effects on cell viability and migration Ibuprofen was used here at 290 μM a concentration that did not cause cytotoxicity , well below the IC 50 s found of 690 μM in THP - 1 and 1 . 16 mM in Jurkat , figure 7 . 8 , and below IC 50 ’s reported by others [ 798 ] . In other cancer cell - lines exposed to growth - supporting media and conditions ibuprofen is reported to have caused apoptosis and / or inhibited proliferation , including in human malignant colorectal , gastric adenocarcinoma , human cutaneous and prostate cancer cells [ 801 , 824 , 825 ] . Ibuprofen may produce a concentration - dependent effect over 24 - 72 hours inhibiting cell proliferation , decreasing cell size and inducing cell rounding with loss of detachment but not direct cytotoxicity [ 801 ] . Akrami et al . ( 2014 ) found Ibuprofen at 500 μM upregulated apoptosis supporting proteins p53 and Bax , and down - regulated angiogenesis supporter VEGF - A along with stemness markers OCT3 / 4 and CDC44 [ 798 ] . Others concur that ibuprofen increases p53 and BAX expression [ 799 ] . At 600 μM Ibuprofen is reported to upregulate MDM2 , p53 , p21 and caspase - 3 along with caspase - 6 to caspase - 9 , while down regulating cell cycle related proteins E2F2 , CDC25A and PCNA . Detailed examination of the effects of ibuprofen on cell cycle genes showed , in a gastric cancer cell - line , that at 600 μM ibuprofen caused cells to move from S and G2 / M phases to G0 / G1 and cause G1 arrest [ 801 ] . Similar effects have been reported for another NSAID , Indomethacin [ 446 ] . Ibuprofen appeared to block cells in G1 , by decreasing cyclins and cyclin - dependent kinase expression and increasing cell cycle inhibition by protein p21 . Ibuprofen at 800 μM also increased Reactive Oxygen Species levels inducing p21 / p53 - dependent apoptosis [ 801 ] . Ibuprofen at 290 μM was found to inhibit chemotaxis and chemokinesis supported by CCL3 and / or CXCL12 in THP - 1 , Jurkat and MCF7 , figures 7 . 9 - 7 . 10 . The mechanism may involve Akt . Ibuprofen is reported to inhibit Akt and hence Pi3K - Akt signalling [ 798 ] . The Akt pathway regulates cell survival , migration and angiogenesis , and Akt inhibition by NSAIDs may induce apoptosis in some cell types [ 826 ] . Akt is pivotal in cancer development . Akt activation requires direct interaction of Akt’s PH domain with PIP 3 , at the plasma membrane . Phosphorylation by kinases PDK1 and mTORC2 activate Akt which can inactivate cell cycle inhibitors p27 and p21 thus facilitating G1 / S phase progression [ 618 , 827 ] . Akt may also interact with Cyclin A2 which activates Cyclin - Dependent Kinase - 2 ( CDK2 ) [ 828 ] . 209 Ibuprofen was found to cause loss and distortion of actin filaments and stress fibres , figure 7 . 11 . Others have examined the effects of NSAIDs in vitro on A549 lung cancer cell morphology . Indomethacin but not Aspirin ( 3 mM ) , or NSAIDs Diclofenac ( 300 μM ) or Sulindac ( 300 μM ) caused exposure time - dependent reversible loss of actin stress fibres along with cell elongation and shrinkage . PGE 2 levels were equally reduced by around 70 % by all four NSAIDs , but morphology was not restored in Indomethacin - treated cells by PGE 2 supplementation . However , only Indomethacin was found to have reduced cellular levels of adhesion molecules , E - cadherin and collagen IV , by upregulating matrix metalloprotease 9 ( MMP9 ) , molecular scissors that support epithelial mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) . Indomethacin’s effects on cell morphology were all reversible by treatment with PPARγ agonist troglitazoneb [ 829 ] . Ibuprofen has been found to activate transcription factor PPARγ [ 830 ] , which is expressed in a very wide range of cancers [ 831 ] , neuronal , and adipocyte cells [ 830 , 832 ] . PPARγ activation inhibits RhoA and Rac1 activation essential for cell migration [ 671 ] , blocks P13K / Akt and Erk1 / 2 signalling [ 833 , 834 ] , and stimulates transcription of PTEN tumour suppressor [ 835 ] . PTEN can dephosphorylate PIP 3 and so inhibit the activation of Akt and also induce mitochondrial translocation of cofilin [ 792 , 793 , 836 ] , although PTEN can be mutated in cancer [ 687 ] . Thus while Indomethacin could potentially aid epithelial - mesenchymal transition from primary tumour and mesenchymal - epithelial transition at a secondary ( seeding ) site [ 829 ] , Ibuprofen by activating PPARγ would not . This may be one factor why the effects of different NSAIDs in cancer are inconsistent . Ibuprofen ability to inhibit cell migration , figures 7 . 9 - 7 . 10 , invites further investigation as potentially may translate to Ibuprofen in vivo inhibiting chemokine - supported metastasis . Other potential therapeutic benefits of Ibuprofen on signalling in cancer include evidence that VEGF , a key mediator of angiogenesis in cancer which induces growth factor release from its target tissues , and fibroblast growth factor production , may be reduced by NSAID inhibition of COX1 and COX2 [ 837 , 838 ] . For Ibuprofen these effects may be concentration dependent . Ibuprofen has been shown to reduce hypoxia - inducible factors HIF - 1α and HIF - 2α , along with HIF - regulated proteins Glut - 1 and VEGF , in cells not expressing COX2 [ 839 ] . Some NSAIDs may inhibit hypoxia - induced angiogenesis by increasing the expression of tumour suppressor VHL so reducing HIFα levels and consequently reducing VEGF secretion [ 840 ] . HIF support tumour survival , aggressiveness and angiogenesis [ 841 ] . Many tissues may produce VEGF including neutrophils , platelets and endothelium [ 842 ] . Ibuprofen may also reduce the production of fibroblast growth factor which supports PGE 2 and PGI 2 inflammation and angiogenesis [ 843 ] . 210 Ibuprofen has been shown to inhibit ovarian and breast cancer growth and tumour PGE 2 levels [ 844 ] , possibly partly through an anti - oestrogenic effect [ 845 ] . Overall Ibuprofen is attributed with many off - target effects , figure 7 . 23 , the drug may even partly reduce pain by inhibiting the excitatory neurotransmitter , Acid Sensing Ion Channel 1a which is involved in pain sensation and inflammation [ 846 ] . Figure 7 . 23 : Ibuprofen’s possible off target effect , and links to cofilin phosphorylation [ 830 , 833 ] . 7 . 3 . 2 : NSAIDS effects on calcium fluctuations Receptor stimulation by physiological agonists such as chemokines can trigger Ca 2 + oscillations [ 847 ] , which then affect gene expression [ 848 ] . Chemokine - stimulated Ca 2 + signalling can stimulate PIP 2 hydrolysis to DAG and Inositol trisphosphate ( InsP 3 ) which then binds InsP 3 receptors , which are calcium release channels in the ER [ 849 ] . The calcium release that follows can stimulate calmodulin [ 850 ] which binds and activates calcineurin , a protein phosphatase , ( and other targets ) which themselves activate transcription factors including NFκB and Nuclear Factor of Activated T - cells ( NFAT ) , and hence Ca 2 + dynamics can regulate gene expression [ 811 , 851 , 852 ] . This can produce proliferation , progression of cell cycle and mediate apoptosis [ 853 ] . Inhibiting T - type Ca 2 + channels can reduce proliferation and support apoptosis in cancer cells [ 854 ] . Also targeting ORAL1 , a plasma membrane pore structure , and STIM1 , an ER calcium I bup r o f e n I bu p r o f e n R a c 1 R h o R O C K C O X 1 / 2 N S A I D s AA M R C K α G E F s P G E 2 P i 3 K A k t L I M K 1 / 2 C o f ili n P M E K E R K 1 / 2 R a f P G H 2 G S K 3 β R a s = a c t i v a t i o n = i nh i b i t i o n ? 211 sensor , ( see annotated illustration chapter 8 , figure 8 . 36 ) which both mediate store operated calcium re - entry following stimulation , may inhibit malignant cell growth [ 855 ] . Here Aspirin , but not Naproxen , was observed to significantly increase overall CXCL12 - stimulated Ca 2 + responses in Jurkat but not to affect THP - 1 Ca 2 + oscillations following CCL3 , figure 7 . 20 . Conversely Celecoxib and Ibuprofen consistently increased peak calcium stimulation levels following CCL3 or CXCL12 in Jurkat MCF7 and THP - 1 , figure 7 . 19 . Overall results suggest calcium responses are chemokine and cell - type specific . Aspirin and some NSAIDs may inhibit Ca 2 + uptake by mitochondria which support Ca 2 + oscillations by importing Ca 2 + after influx effectively acting as Ca 2 + buffers [ 856 ] . NSAIDs and Aspirin have for many years been reported as having inhibitory effects on malignant cell proliferation [ 857 , 858 ] , as has Phenacetin which is converted to Paracetamol in vivo [ 857 ] . Proposed mechanisms include modulation of calcium dynamics that support migration . This may be via modulation of focal adhesions ; by inhibiting store - operated calcium influx focal adhesion turnover is stalled , inhibiting cell migration [ 859 , 860 ] . The crosstalk between the immune and nervous systems contributes to inflammation in cancer [ 861 ] . The transient receptor potential ( TRP ) proteins are a family of cation proteins implicated in pro - inflammatory immune cells including macrophages and T - cells [ 862 ] . Important TRPs include TRPV1 and TRPA1 ; both play key roles in neurogenic inflammation . Both are Ca 2 + permeable non - selective cation channels that can depolarise plasma membranes allowing Ca 2 + influx . Activation of TRPV1 produces anti - tumour activity in many breast cancer types [ 863 ] and may be therapeutic in other cancers including bladder and endometrial [ 864 , 865 ] . However Ca 2 + influx through another TRP cation channel , Transient Receptor Potential Melanostatine - 2 ( TRPM2 ) , is reported to contribute to Paracetamol toxic effects in overdose [ 866 ] . Many inflammatory mediators , including prostaglandins and cytokines , act as TRP channel agonists , for example CCL3 has been shown to sensitize TRPs and activate TRPV2 Ca 2 + channels [ 867 ] and TRPA1 agonists include a metabolite of PGD 2 called 15 - deoxy - δ ( 12 , 14 ) - PGJ 2 [ 868 ] . The actions of agonists at TRPA1 and TRPV1 and channel activation are dependent on both agonist combinations and concentrations , plus intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations [ 869 , 870 ] . PGE 2 can increase cytosolic free calcium in monocytes treated with 10 nM CCL3 or CXCL12 [ 802 ] . Paracetamol also produced specific chemokine and cell - type calcium responses , figure 7 . 18 . The mode of action of Paracetamol , discussed in chapter one section 1 . 9 . 2 , includes increasing levels of anandamide , which can act as a T - type calcium channel blocker [ 871 ] and inhibits Ca v 3 . 2 channels [ 872 ] . Paracetamol in vivo is metabolized to p - aminophenol in the liver then to N - ( 4 - 212 hydroxyphenyl ) - 5 , 8 , 11 , 14 - eicosatetraenamide ( AM404 ) by fatty acid amide hydrolase in the brain [ 421 ] . AM404 can activate TRPV1 channels . TRPV1 may interact with Ca v 3 . 2 channels found in the dorsal horn and dorsal root ganglion , two key pain pathway areas [ 820 , 873 ] . Therefore in vitro investigations into Paracetamol’s effects on calcium responses may not accurately reflect in vivo reality . 7 . 3 . 3 : NSAIDs and basal cAMP levels The cAMP / PKA pathway must be tightly regulated to prevent excessive immunological activation . NSAIDs negatively regulate the cAMP / PKA pathway by inhibiting COX1 and COX2 . Inhibition of these enzymes with NSAIDs blocks PGE 2 synthesis , which subsequently , via EP3 receptors and G i responses , downregulates cAMP levels in some immune cells including T - cells , see figure 7 . 24 . This may enhance anti - tumour responses in cancer [ 874 - 877 ] . Although neither Ibuprofen , Paracetamol or Celecoxib had any significant effect on cAMP falls following CCL2 stimulation , figure 7 . 21 , results suggest that COX2 inhibition with Paracetamol and Celecoxib may downregulate basal cAMP levels in THP - 1 monocytes , this may deserve further investigation for anti - cancer effects . COX2 is expressed in adenoma and malignant tissues but colon cancer initiation appears connected with COX2 expression in macrophages within mildly dysplasic adenoma tissues [ 878 ] . Inhibition of COX2 appears therapeutic in preventing progression of dysplasia to cancer [ 786 ] , possibly as COX2 expression in macrophages supports angiogenesis . Colon tumours have high macrophage density as CCL2 recruits circulating monocytes which differentiate to macrophages . In macrophages CCL2 stimulates both COX2 expression and , via a COX2 / PGE2 autocrine / paracrine pathway , Vascular Endothelium Growth Factor ( VEGF ) release [ 787 ] . 7 . 3 . 4 : The Prostaglandin Cascade , cAMP and Cofilin PGE 2 is produced through COX metabolism of membrane arachidonic acid . PGE 2 can produce effects through the E - series Prostanoid GPCRs [ 879 ] which through Gα s G - proteins increase cAMP activity stimulating PAK and Epac1 / 2 which acting via PTEN [ 791 ] inhibit macrophage phagocytosis [ 880 ] . PTEN can dephosphorylate PIP 3 and inhibit Akt [ 791 , 881 ] . The PGE 2 triggered cAMP signalling through PKA and PTEN can activate cofilin - 1 preventing effective actin polymerization [ 409 ] so NSAIDs may , through inhibition of PGE 2 production , influence phosphorylation of cofilin and hence cell migration . Prostanoids can coordinate autocrine and paracrine signalling by binding GPCRs EP1 - 4 [ 882 ] . COX1 and COX2 are regulated by arachidonate and peroxide availability . The lower levels of substrate peroxide activate COX2 more than COX1 [ 883 ] . Tissue - specific synthases then control the pathway from PGH 2 onwards [ 459 ] , figure 7 . 24 . 213 Figure 7 . 24 : Hydrolysis of the ester linkage in phospholipid by phospholipases C and A2 releases arachidonic acid which COX1 & COX2 along with peroxidases oxidise to PGH 2 . Specific prostaglandin synthases then produce products including prostanoid PGE 2 . PGE 2 binds prostaglandin E 2 receptors 1 – 4 . Leukocytes carry EP2 and EP4 receptors , stimulation of which activate Adenylyl Cyclase ( AC ) and increases cAMP . EP4 signals via Gαi , Pi3K , β - arrestin , and β - catenin [ 884 - 886 ] . Celecoxib , Aspirin , Naproxen and Paracetamol were all found to reduce cofilin phosphorylation , figure 7 . 22 , an expected response from drugs which reduce PGE 2 levels . However pre - treatment with Ibuprofen consistently caused cofilin phosphorylation in the presence and absence of CCL3 or CXCL12 . Ibuprofen can decrease RhoA activation and ROCK - 1 expression [ 794 , 887 ] . Ibuprofen enhances axonal sprouting and regeneration [ 888 ] possibly as activation of Rho contributes to lack of nerve regeneration [ 889 ] . So logically Ibuprofen should inhibit PGE 2 and possibly directly RhoA - ROCK - LIMK - cofilin phosphorylation , but as the above blots show this was not found to be the case . Ibuprofen is also reported to mediate cytoskeletal Ca 2 + binding protein Swiprosin - 1 aka EFHD2 [ 890 ] , which is present in monocytes [ 891 ] , and both buffers intracellular Ca 2 + and regulates Phospholipase A 2 Phospholipid Phospholipase C Arachidonic Acid PGG 2 PGH 2 Cyclooxygenase 1 constitutively expressed Cyclooxygenase 2 inducible Peroxidase PGF 2 PGD 2 PGE 2 PGI 2 TXA 2 ↑Pain + Vasodilation PPARβ / δ ↑Renal perfusion PGG 2 Peroxidase ↑Pi3K / Akt signalling Protects cells from apoptosis ?

Here Ibuprofen was shown to increase peak calcium flux levels in response to chemokines , figure 7 . 19 . Raised Ca 2 + may enhance Calcineurin’s activation of Slingshot , hence dephosphorylation of cofilin [ 893 ] , conversely here Ibuprofen increased phosphocofilin levels , figure 7 . 22 . Amplification of Swiprosin - 1 , which lies upstream of Cdc42 , Rac and Rho , has been shown to increase the effects of CXCL12 on Jurkat . When inhibited Swiprosin - 1 may amplify Rho and PAK signalling stimulating cofilin phosphorylation through LIMK [ 894 ] . Ibuprofen mediation of Swiprosin - 1 may contribute to Ibuprofen’s effects on cofilin phosphorylation , calcium flux , actin filaments , figure 7 . 11 , and chemokinesis , figures 7 . 9 - 7 . 10 . Also Ibuprofen is reported to inhibit MEK - ERK signalling [ 895 ] . The MEK small molecule inhibitor SL327 also consistently strongly induces cofilin phosphorylation ( chapter 5 , figure 5 . 45 ) possibly suggesting that Ibuprofen may have some anti - cancer effects through strongly inhibiting MEK signalling and chemotaxis . 7 . 4 : Conclusions Only Ibuprofen amongst the drugs investigated here inhibited chemotaxis or chemokinesis to both chemokines in all three cell - lines . Naproxen inhibited CXCL12 migration in Jurkat and THP - 1 but not CCL3 - induced migration in THP - 1 or chemokinesis in MCF7 . Whereas Aspirin inhibited CXCL12 but not CCL3 - chemotaxis and Celecoxib and Paracetamol had no effect on chemotaxis although Celecoxib did inhibit MCF7 chemokinesis . These results were not explain by cytotoxicity as for example Celecoxib appeared more cytotoxic , IC 50 54 μM in THP - 1 and 48 μM in Jurkat , than Ibuprofen , IC 50 1 . 16 mM in Jurkat and 690 μM in THP - 1 . Thus Aspirin and NSAIDs but not Paracetamol appear able to inhibit chemotaxis and / or chemokinesis but they may do so in a chemokine and cell - type specific fashion . All the drugs tested here modulated calcium oscillations in a cell - or chemokine - specific manor . In THP - 1 , Paracetamol and Celecoxib but not Ibuprofen significantly reduced basal cAMP levels but not cAMP level reduction produced by CCL2 suggesting signalling involving calcium channels or cAMP may be involved in some of NSAIDs off - target effects . Aspirin , Naproxen , Ibuprofen and Celecoxib all adversely influenced actin filament formation . Also Celecoxib , Aspirin , Naproxen and Paracetamol eliminated , but Ibuprofen increased , THP - 1 basal phosphorylation of cofilin , and that following treatment with CCL3 or CXCL12 . The results suggest the effects of Ibuprofen , Naproxen , Celecoxib and Aspirin , on cancer initiation and progression should be assessed individually , as each produced contrasting responses to chemokines . Ibuprofen appears the most consistent and potent inhibitor of chemotaxis and 215 chemokinesis and Ibuprofens eliciting of cofilin phosphorylation suggest its reported antineoplastic effects may be PGE2 - independent ; possibly acting through inhibiting MEK signalling or modulation of cytoskeletal protein cytoskeletal Ca 2 + buffering protein Swiprosin - 1 . Fascinatingly the R - enantiomer of Naproxen , which is marketed as a racemic mix , has been found to inhibit Rho GTPase Rac1 and act in a similar way to popular Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 [ 896 ] . Also Rac1 overexpression in bowel cancer may be prevented by NSAIDS [ 897 ] . These factors raised the questions ; what effects does Rac1 inhibition have on CXCL12 - and CCL3 - chemotaxis , and cofilin phosphorylation ? Investigations exploring these questions are reported in chapter 8 . 216 Chapter 8 : Rac1 mediates chemotaxis to CXCL12 but not CCL3 , in leukaemic and breast cancer cell - lines , and Rac1 GEF inhibitor NSC23766 may have off - target effects on CXCR4 / CXCR7 axis 8 . 1 : Introduction The CXCR4 / CXCL12 axis is complex , as CXCR4 variants and oligomerization along with CXCL12 functioning in monomeric and dimeric forms adds to the challenge of understanding CXCL12 - induced chemotaxis in cancers [ 142 , 145 , 148 ] . The illumination of how CXCR4 ligands , such as CXCL12 and AMD3100 , bind has taken extensive research over decades [ 147 , 149 ] . CXCR4 ligands have the potential to mitigate metastasis [ 135 ] . Ras family Rho GTPases , co - ordinate actin polymerization , cell adhesion and cytoskeletal dynamics . They are molecular switches which can be activated by chemokines to trigger downstream signalling pathways [ 330 , 336 ] . Rho GTPases are controlled by three sets of proteins Rho GDIs which can sequester and inactivate RhoGTPases [ 337 ] ; Rho GAPs which facilitate switching ‘off’ Rho GTPases [ 341 , 342 ] ; and Rho GEFs which promote switching Rho GTPase ‘on’ . There are many Rho GEFs , most are controlled by phosphorylation [ 330 , 338 , 343 ] . One important Rho GTPase , Rac1 , is key in the formulation of lamellipodia and overall cell motility [ 334 ] , figure 8 . 1 . Rac1 is activated , i . e . bound GDP is replaced by GTP , by Rho GEFs including Tiam1 and TrioN . In some cell - lines Rac1 supports chemotaxis through signalling also involving Akt and PKC [ 344 , 346 - 350 ] . Here the aim was to elucidate the role of Rac1 in CXCL12 - and CCL3 - induced chemotaxis and wound - healing using small molecule inhibitor NSC23766 which purportedly selectively inhibits Rac1 interactions with Rho GEFs Tiam1 and TrioN [ 346 ] , direct Rac1 inhibitor EHT1864 , and Rac1 - inhibiting peptide W56 . 217 Figure 8 . 1 : CXCL12 - induced signalling can be modified by CXCR4 inhibition , for example with AMD3100 or ATI2341 , and by Rac1 inhibition with W56 or NSC23766 . Hypothesis : Rac1 signalling is important for chemokine - supported cell migration of both haematopoietic and epithelial cancers . Aim : To elucidate the role of Rac1 in THP - 1 and Jurkat chemotaxis , MCF7 chemokinesis , cofilin phosphorylation , cAMP responses and calcium flux stimulated by chemokines CXCL12 and CCL3 . Objectives : ( i ) Explore the role of Rac1 in THP - 1 and Jurkat chemotaxis and MCF7 wound - healing using small molecule inhibitor NSC23766 , and Rac1 - inhibiting peptide W56 . ( ii ) Examine the effect of CXCR4 small molecule inhibition on Rac1 activation . ( iii ) Investigate if Rac1 inhibition interacts positively or negatively with CXCR4 - binding antibody or small molecule inhibitors using chemotaxis assays and flow cytometry .

( vi ) Explore the effects of Rac1 inhibition in THP - 1 and Jurkat on calcium mobilisation triggered by chemokine stimulation . ( vii ) Examine if inhibition of Cdc42 or PLC affects chemotaxis , calcium flux or cAMP levels in THP - 1 and Jurkat . ( viii ) Investigate if Rac1 inhibition modulates actin filament formation or cofilin phosphorylation in response to CXCL12 in THP - 1 . ( ix ) Discover if NSC23766 or W56 affect THP - 1 chemotaxis to other CXC and CC chemokines .

The tools used to achieve the chapter aims included small molecule inhibitors of Rac , NSC23766 and EHT1864 , along with a peptide that binds a region of the human Rac1 protein between its two Switch regions . Rac1 residues 45 - 60 appear critical for specific Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEF’s ) recognition and activation , with Trp56 located in the Rac1 Switch II region being key for specificity between Rac1 and Cdc42 binding . These 15 residues , ( see chapter one , figure 1 . 16 ) , have been found to act as a very specific inhibitor preventing Rac1 – GEF interactions [ 898 ] . Two 15 amino acid peptides were synthesised : active peptide W56 sequence VDGKPVNLGLWDTAG , and inactive control F56 sequence VDGKPVNLGLFDTAG where the key amino acid Trp56 was replaced by Phe56 to inactivate the peptide . 8 . 2 . 1 : NSC23766 inhibits chemotaxis to CXCL12 but not CCL3 NSC23766 is a small molecule inhibitor that binds to the surface of Rac1 at the location where Rac1 specific GEFs Tiam1 and TrioN bind [ 899 ] . Hence NSC23766 inhibits TrioN and Tiam1 binding and activating Rac1 . NSC23766 effects on Jurkat , THP - 1 and MCF7 chemotaxis or chemokinesis in response to CCL3 and CXCL12 were examined , figure 8 . 2 .

Combining chemokines CXCL12 1 nM and CCL3 1 nM increased migration further , but not in the presence of NSC23766 , suggesting either a direct effect of NSC23766 on CXCR4 or that Rac1 specifically supports CXCL12 - induced chemotaxis . In Jurkat CXCL12 assays 100 μM NSC23766 consistently highly significantly inhibited chemotaxis . AMD3100 inhibits CXCR4 so its effect on THP - 1 chemotaxis to CXCL12 but also CCL3 was investigated . AMD3100 was found to produce a small ( p < 0 . 05 ) inhibitory effect on CCL3 chemotaxis , while very significantly inhibiting chemotaxis to CXCL12 ( p < 0 . 001 ) , figure 8 . 3 , suggesting CXCR4 may play a role in CCL3 / CCR5 or CCL3 / CCR1 chemotaxis or that AMD3100 has some off target effects .

However the dramatic effect on Jurkat migration to CXCL12 did stand out . Unfortunately Jurkat fail to migrate to other chemokines in any numbers so the effects of CXCL12 on Rac activation were explored using a Rac1 activation pull - down assay , and western blotting . Rac1 activation signal was clear in MCF7 but not detected in THP - 1 or Jurkat ; possibly this is not surprising as only 5 - 10 % of Rac1 may be activated by extracellular stimulation [ 900 ] . In MCF7 NSC23766 and two CXCR4 inhibitors , AMD3100 and ATI2341 , clearly inhibited Rac1 activation by CXCL12 , figure 8 . 7 .

These results suggested that the responses seen with NSC23766 treatment on CXCL12 - induced chemotaxis in Jurkat and THP - 1 may not be predominantly due to the effects of the inhibitor on Rac1 GEFs Tiam1 or TrioN . Published research suggests NSC23766 may have off target affinity for NMDA and mACh receptors [ 901 , 902 ] , so investigations into NSC23766’s effect on CXCR4 signalling were undertaken . Firstly chemotaxis assays to CXCL12 at a range of concentrations were conducted with NSC23766 at lower than concentrations , 25 μM and 50 μM , than previously used in Jurkat chemotaxis . The results suggested CXCL12 and NSC23766 may be competing for CXCR4 , and / or that NSC23766 by interacting with CXCR7 , is modulating CXCL12’s effect on CXCR4 , figure 8 . 8 . 223 Jurkat Jurkat A B Figure 8 . 8 : Chemotaxis assays of Jurkat treated with NSC23766 ( A ) 25 μM or ( B ) 50 μM to reducing concentrations of CXCL12 , the ratio of treated to untreated cells migrating , at each concentration of CXCL12 , are shown in green . Means ± SEM , one - way ANOVA , post - hoc Bonferroni , n≥3 independent experiments . Figure 8 . 8 shows that the inhibitory effect of a set concentration of NSC23766 increased as the concentration of CXCL12 decreased . For example with CXCL12 at 1 nM and NSC23766 at 50 μM the ratio of inhibition was 60 ; and with CXCL12 at 0 . 5 nM , 70 . This indicated a concentration response towards CXCL12 , suggesting the inhibitor and the chemokine may be competing for CXCR4 . The data from the above chemotaxis assays translates to the concentration response curves below , figure 8 . 9 . Jurkat Jurkat A B Figure 8 . 9 : Data from figure 8 . 8 shown as concentration response curves towards CXCL12 comparing control or NSC23766 treatment at ( A ) 25 μM or ( B ) 50 μM . Means ± SEM , one - way ANOVA , post - hoc Bonferroni , n≥3 independent experiments . The sigmoidal dose response curve indicates a reduction in CXCL12 potency in the presence of NSC23766 . The CXCL12 EC 50 calculates as 0 . 19 nM in absence of NSC23766 25 μM and as 2 nM in presence of 50 μM NSC23766 , however the efficacy of CXCL12 remains the same . This suggests NSC23766 may have been acting as a competitive antagonist of CXCR4 in these migration assays .

( B ) Data from ( A ) illustrating that with CXCL12 1 nM the combined inhibitory effects on chemotaxis of NSC23766 and 12G5 reached a maximal at NSC23766 100 μM . Figure 8 . 10 illustrates that 12 . 5 μM NSC23766 does not add greatly to 12G5 inhibitory effects on chemotaxis but that 25 μM or 50 μM NSC23766 has an additive inhibitory effect to 12G5 ; and at 100 μM NSC23766 the presence or absence of 12G5 makes no difference , inhibition is at a maximum , yet compared to the absence of CXCL12 some chemotaxis to CXCL12 still occurs . This suggests CXCR4 activity is not completely abrogated by either NSC23766 100 μM or 12G5 , or the combination , hence neither is totally blocking CXCL12 stimulation . These results may suggest NSC23766 binds the same or similar sites to 12G5 and that these sites impact CXCL12 binding but do not completely abrogate the chemokine activating CXCR4 . However results do not exclude the possibility that NSC23766 could be acting as an allosteric modulator , or is binding CXCR7 so modulating CXCR4 / CXCR7 dimerization which could also partly but not completely inhibit chemotaxis to CXCL12 . 8 . 2 . 7 : ATI2341 , AMD3100 and NSC23766 are not chemotactic to Jurkat The small molecule CXCR4 inhibitors AMD3100 and ATI2341 were then employed to establish what response they would have in Jurkat and THP - 1 chemotaxis assays to CXCL12 .

( B ) Inhibitors NSC23766 , AMD3100 or ATI2341 did not show any chemotactic properties towards Jurkat . Means ± SEM , n≥3 independent experiments . Allosteric ligands bind to spatially distinct sites away from the orthosteric site , but are capable of modifying the orthosteric site conformation . Allosteric ligands can have higher receptor isoform selectivity and often have limited or subtle effects on normal spatiotemporal signalling , also their maximal effect may be determined by co - operation with endogenous ligand / s . If they affect orthosteric signalling an allosteric ligand can produce positive or negative modulation of orthosteric agonism . But equally allosteric ligands may themselves act as agonists or inverse agonists . An agonist can shift a receptor from an inactive conformation to an active one , an inverse agonist moves a receptor to an inactive state . An agonist’s efficacy is a measure of the shift to an active state [ 904 ] . 8 . 2 . 8 : CXCR4 inhibition in presence of NSC23766 MTS assays found no evidence of toxicity for AMD3100 or ATI2341 up to 10 μM , in MCF7 , THP - 1 or Jurkat ( data not shown ) .

At 25 μM NSC23766 , both 0 . 2 μM AMD3100 and 5 μM ATI2341 added to inhibition of chemotaxis . At 50 μM NSC23766 and above inhibition of chemotaxis was increased by allosteric inhibition with 5 μM ATI2341 but the combined inhibitory effect of NSC23766 and 0 . 5 μM AMD3100 was not any greater than 0 . 5 μM AMD3100 alone . At 100 μM NSC23766 neither AMD3100 , nor ATI2341 added to inhibition , figure 8 . 12 . These results support the above suggestion that in Jurkat NSC23766 may act as a competitive antagonist in CXCL12 - induced chemotaxis . 8 . 2 . 9 : Flow cytometry demonstrated NSC23766 was displacing CXCR4 antibody 12G5 Flow cytometry was used to explore the effects of NSC23766 with Rac1 - inhibiting peptide W56 , and then with ATI2341 , AMD3100 CXCR4 inhibitors , on CXCR4 expression in presence and absence of CXCL12 , figures 8 . 13 - 8 . 14 .

Sodium azide non - significantly increased CXCR4 expression , in control , in absence but not presence of CXCL12 . AMD3100 and NSC23766 both reduced CXCR4 basal signal . In presence of sodium azide NSC23766 but not AMD3100 very significantly increased CXCR4 expression after CXCL12 stimulation . Sucrose very significantly increased CXCR4 basal signal before but not after CXCL12 stimulation , so in the absence of CXCL12 sucrose does hinder CXCR4 internalisation . AMD3100 and NSC23766 reduced CXCR4 basal signal similarly in the presence of sucrose before CXCL12 stimulation but neither significantly changed CXCR4 signal after CXCL12 treatment . 8 . 2 . 12 : NSC23766 may act as a biased antagonist with respect to cAMP signalling The CXCR4 receptor couples to heterotrimeric G - proteins , including Gα i ; Gα i responses include reduction of cellular second messenger cAMP levels , figure 8 . 17 .

AMD3100 , ATI2341 did not significantly change basal levels or those after CXCL12 treatment , and H89 HCl statistically significantly increased cAMP levels both before and after 20 minutes CXCL12 treatment , figure 8 . 17 . 8 . 2 . 13 : cAMP levels may modulate PKCζ signalling The RhoGEF Tiam1 has been reported to sit in a feedback loop involving cAMP , Rac1 , PKCζ and CXCR4 . Increasing cAMP levels has been shown to increase the presence of membrane CXCR4 , by both reducing CXCR4 endocytosis , prolonging CXCR4’s stay at the membrane , and increasing the speed of recycling CXCR4 back to the membrane from endosomes [ 906 ] . Increasing cAMP also antagonises CXCL12 - induced receptor internalisation [ 907 ] . The effects of siRNA inhibition of PKCζ on CXCL12 chemotaxis in Jurkat , along with CXCL12 and CCL3 wound - healing in MCF7 cells confirmed the involvement of PKCζ in the CXCL12 and CCL3 signalling pathways , figure 8 . 18 .

Hence Rac activation may be influenced by intracellular calcium levels .

NSC23766 produced opposite effects on calcium signalling in THP - 1 in response to CXCL12 and CCL3 , figure 8 . 20 , again suggesting it may be having a direct effect on CXCR4 or a modulator of CXCR4 and CCR5 . It also dramatically reduced calcium signalling in response to CXCL12 in Jurkat , and dose dependently in MCF7 , figure 8 . 21 .

NSC23766 produces very significant inhibition of calcium release in response to CXCL12 in both Jurkat and MCF7 . As expected both chemokines produced a rapid but transient rise in calcium release . The biased effects of NSC23766 suggested either that Rac1 activation relates to CXCL12 - induced but not CCL3 - induced calcium signalling , or that NSC23766 is having a direct or indirect effect on CXCR4 . CXCL12 was found to trigger calcium release in Jurkat dose dependently up to 10 nM , figure 8 . 22 , and NSC23766 at 100 μM was found to inhibit this calcium release , but this inhibition was eroded as CXCL12 dose increased to 100 nM . NSC23766 and CXCL12 appeared to be competing for CXCR4 . Jurkat Figure 8 . 22 : Fura2 Ca 2 + assay in Jurkat following 100 μM NSC23766 or control .

THP - 1 migration towards CCL2 or CXCL9 was not reduced by either NSC2376 , W56 or F56 whereas both NSC23766 and W56 reduced migration towards CXCL11 , figure 8 . 30 . 8 . 2 . 19 : CXCL14 modulates CXCR4 / CXCL12 signalling in Jurkat CXCL14 is a non ELR CXC chemokine with similarities in structure to CXCL12 . The N - terminus of a chemokine interacts with its receptor , in CXCL14 this NH 2 tail is shorter than in CXCL12 or CXCL11 [ 914 ] , and contains a unique amino acid sequence which appears to be CXCL14’s ‘Achilles heel’ in cancer . The sequence allows CXCL14 to be targeted for ubiquitination and degraded by proteasomes , but this may occur only in malignant and immortalised cells . Destroying CXCL14 may help cancer cells hide from the immune system [ 915 ] . High expression of CXCL14 is linked to improved overall and event free survival in some cancers [ 916 ] . This may explain why responses to CXCL14 dramatically differ in various primary and malignant cell - lines , for example in cells that express CXCL14 , like monocytes and THP - 1 , CXCL14 is chemotactic , in vivo this may support CXCL14’s role in immune surveillance , however CXCL14 can also inhibit endothelial cell migration , proliferation and be angiostatic [ 917 ] .

Figure 8 . 31 illustrates that even high concentrations of CXCL14 , either as pre - treatment or mixed with CXCL12 as chemoattractant , inhibited but did not completely prevent chemotaxis of Jurkat to CXCL12 . CXCL14 pre - treatment was found to dose - dependently inhibit chemotaxis to CXCL12 1 nM by up to about ~ 45 % , whereas in the presence of 0 . 5 nM CXCL12 , CXCL14 at concentrations above 50 nM reduce chemotaxis by ~ 25 % , suggesting concentration of these two chemokines is key .

NSC23766 but not W56 was found to significantly reduce the expression of CXCR4 in the presence of CXCL14 and in the presence of CXCL12 and CXCL14 , figure 8 . 33 , both chemokines reputedly bind and cause internalisation of CXCR4 , NSC23766 at 100 μM potentiated their effects . 8 . 3 : Discussion Results indicate specific Rac1 signalling differences in CCL3 - and CXCL12 - induced cell migration and suggest a surprising role for NSC23766 as a allosteric modulator of CXCR4 . 8 . 3 . 1 : Rac1 inhibitor produces chemokine specific responses Figures 8 . 2 , 8 . 5 and 8 . 6 indicate Rac1 inhibition specifically inhibits migration to CXCL12 but not CCL3 . In contrast Cdc42 inhibition equally inhibits both CCL3 and CXCL12 chemotaxis , figure 8 . 27 . Serine palmitoyltransferase ( SPT ) is an enzyme consisting of two components , SPT long chain base subunit 1 ( SPTLC1 ) and SPTLC2 . SPTLC1 interacts with Par3 , a scaffolding factor , which recruits proteins such as atypical PKC and Cdc42 into PAR complexes required for directional migration . SPTLC1 is expressed in THP - 1 cells . Loss of Par3 in THP - 1 is reported to inhibit their migration to Flow cytometry measurement of CXCR4 expression in Jurkat CXCL14 100 nM , CXCL12 15 nM 23 . 3 . 16 c on t r o l n e g C on t r o l C X C R 4 M  N S C 23766 100 M  W 56 280 C on t r o l + C X C L 14 N S C 23766 + C X C L 14 W 56 + C X C L 14 C on t r o l + C X C L 12 N S C 23766 + C X C L 12 W 56 + C X C L 12 C on t r o l + C X C L 12 + C X C L 14 N S C 23766 + C X C L 12 + C X C L 14 W 56 + C X C L 12 + C X C L 14 0 100 200 * ns * ns * M ea n FL 1 - H 241 inflammatory chemokine CCL2 [ 920 ] . NSC23766 inhibits Tiam1 which promotes tight junction assembly through Rac activation and the Par complex . Inhibition of Tiam1 could conversely therefore promote migration through a transwell plate 5 μM pore , if clumping of cells was inhibiting them moving through the pores towards the chemokine . This may be what is apparent in figure 8 . 2 ( B ) . Atypical PKCζ is reported to phosphorylate Tiam1 , stabilising its interaction with Par3 . The Par complex is reportedly crucial for cell polarity and chemotaxis [ 347 ] . CCL3 may phosphorylate Tiam1 , which may be dependent on PKC as well as Par3 for activity . Tiam1 phosphorylation may be required for Rac1 activation , although this can be a transient effect depending on cell type and balance between phosphatases and kinases . 14 - 3 - 3 regulatory proteins can bind Tiam - 1 N - terminal PEST sequences triggering Tiam1 degradation . Tiam1 needs to be bound to membrane Phosphatidylinositol 5 - phosphate ( PtdIns5P ) to be active ; PtdIns5P can potentiate Tiam1 activity . Tiam1 has a myristoylation motif at its N - terminal which favours plasma membrane binding . Binding of Tiam1 to PtdIns5P can restrict Rac1 activation , causing active Tiam1 and Rac1 to relocate to early endosomes and membrane ruffles . Whereas treatment with NSC23766 is reported to restore F - actin polymerization [ 921 ] . So the dramatic differences seen in NSC23766’s effects on CCL3 and CXCL12 in the THP - 1 may be differences in Rac1 signalling between CCL3 and CXCL12 . This theory was supported by the inhibitory actions of NSC23766 on CXCL12 chemotaxis in Jurkat , but results seen were also the first indication that the NSC23766 was having some off - target effects on CXCR4 . 8 . 3 . 2 : Rac GEF inhibitor NSC23766 The investigations undertaken with Rac GEF inhibitor NSC23766 reported here revealed some surprising results , suggesting NSC23766 modulates CXCR4 signalling either directly or allosterically as well as producing Rac1 inhibition . NSC23766 , figure 8 . 34 , is a nitrogen rich molecule with many rotatable bonds , making it a flexible molecule that could potentially bind into several sites on many receptors including CXCR4 . Figure 8 . 34 : Structure of Rac1 GEF inhibitor NSC23766 NSC23766 contains primary , secondary and tertiary amines , a methylpyrimidine ring , a base weakened by the inductive effect of the second nitrogen , and a substituted quinoline ring , 6 - methyl - 4 , 6 - quinolinediamine . NSC23766 has a methylated butyl amine tail which may , like CXCR4 242 inhibitor AMD11070 , interact with Asp97 in TM2 . NSC23766 also has a plentiful supply of amines in common with CXCR4 / CXCL12 signalling inhibitors AMD3100 , AMD11070 and AMD3465 . Testing NSC23766 with CXCR4 Glu288 ( TM7 ) and Asp97 mutants , along with several ECL2 residue mutants , could provide evidence of if , and where , NSC23766 binds CXCR4 , which would explain its ability to so effectively block CXCL12 activation in Jurkat , and less dramatically THP - 1 . There are several orientation options for computer modelling of NSC23766 onto CXCR4 . NSC23766 has basic nitrogens so can form ionic bonds , and electronegative nitrogens so can form H - bonds . For example further research could investigate if NSC23766 forms ionic interactions with negatively charged amino acids Asp97 , Asp171 ( TM4 ) , Glu179 , Asp181 , Asp182 ( ECL2 ) , Asp262 ( TM6 ) and Glu288 , cationic π - interactions with Trp94 ( TM2 ) , or aromatic interactions with Tyr45 ( TM1 ) or Trp94 ( TM2 ) , or if NSC23766 binding disrupts the essential Cys186 ( ECL2 ) – Cys109 ( ECL1 ) disulphide bond . Interestingly NSC23766 has been found to act as a competitive antagonist at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors ( mAChRs ) and at the NMDA receptor [ 901 , 902 ] . NSC23766 was found to inhibit carbachol responses in human - derived HEK293 cells expressing M 1 , M 2 and M 3 mAChRs and act as a non - selective mAChR competitive antagonist . Computer modelling , which was not backed by mutant studies and so is speculative , suggested NSC23766 could theoretically bind M 2 and M 3 AChRs orthosteric binding pocket on the receptor extracellular surface . The suggestion was that NSC23766’s diethylamine group’s positively charged tertiary amine nitrogen could have electrostatic interactions with Asp , Tyr , or Trp residues . This would position NSC23766’s butyl chain methyl group sitting in a hydrophobic pocket in M 2 AChRs formed of Ala , Tyr , Phe and Trp residues ; the methylpyrimidine position 3 nitrogen acting as hydrogen acceptor to a Tyr residue in M 2 AChR and the methylquinolinediamine ring with hydrophobic interactions with Tyr , Trp and Thr residues [ 901 ] . NSC23766 binding on NMDA receptor was not computer modelled by Hou et al . ( 2014 ) , but it would be interesting to examine the mAChRs , NMDA and CXCR4 receptors using computer modelling looking for similar pockets where NSC23766 could theoretically bind . 8 . 3 . 3 : NSC23766 competes with CXCL12 and 12G5 Rac1 activation can be prevented by CXCR4 inhibitors but also by NSC23766 , figure 8 . 7 , suggesting NSC23766 may be interacting with CXCR4 . NSC23766 also competes with CXCL12 and 12G5 , figures 8 . 8 - 8 . 10 . 12G5 CXCR4 binding has been extensive researched . CXCR4 antibodies are reported to predominantly target CXCR4’s extracellular domains , ECL1 , ECL2 , ECL3 and N - terminal region [ 903 ] , see figure 1 . 5 , chapter 1 . Western blots with 12G5 failed to show any specific binding ( data not shown ) suggesting that 12G5 binding is conformational dependent , hence NSC23766 just changing CXCR4 conformation could explain FACS results , figures 8 . 13 - 8 . 14 . The 243 failure of 12G5 to completely prevent chemotaxis may be attributed to CXCR4 conformational heterogeneity , as has been identified in both CD4 + and CD4 - Jurkat cells , indicating that Jurkat may carry two or more CXCR4 conformations . Whereas CXCL12 may bind all conformations of CXCR4 , 12G5 may not , also receptor dimerization or position in lipid rafts may influence 12G5 binding [ 903 ] . Conformation of CXCR4 ECL2 , which contains residues 176 to 202 , has been found essential for 12G5 binding in Jurkat , with residues Asp176 , Glu179 and Asp181 essential , and N - terminal residues 1 - 23 unimportant . G - protein phosphorylation or activation and N - linked glycosylation or sulfation appears not to affect 12G5 binding [ 903 , 922 ] . ECL2 residue Cys186 which forms disulphide bonds with Cys109 ( ECL1 ) are needed for CXCR4 tertiary structure , and if broken weaken 12G5 binding [ 923 ] . Cys186 , Asp187 and Tyr190 mutations either disrupt the conformation of ECL2 or are directly involved in 12G5 binding [ 151 , 153 ] . Asp171 on TM4 close to ECL2 also appears to influence 12G5 binding [ 924 ] . 12G5 binding reportedly requires two disulphide bonds to be intact , not for binding but for CXCR4 conformation , between Cys28 ( N - terminal ) and Cys274 ( ECL3 ) , plus Cys186 ( ECL2 ) and Cys109 ( ECL1 ) [ 922 ] . Signoret et al . ( 1997 ) exquisitely demonstrated that CXCL12 only modestly completes for 12G5 binding in T - cells [ 279 ] . Another explanation for the observed results in figures 8 . 8 - 8 . 10 are that NSC23766 is modulating CXCR4 / CXCR7 heterodimer or oligomer formation . Certainly neither NSC23766 , ATI2341 nor AMD3100 produced chemotaxis in Jurkat , figure 8 . 11 . 8 . 3 . 4 : CXCR7 receptor in cancer CXCR7 , aka RDC - 1 , a receptor which binds CXCL11 and CXCL12 , is deemed pro - tumorigenic in malignancy and is upregulated in many cancers and cell - lines . CXCR7 is a highly conserved receptor across mammalian species and is now accepted as a major player in CXCR4 - CXCL12 signalling . Interestingly the affinity of CXCR7 for CXCL12 exceeds that of CXCR4 [ 106 , 656 , 925 ] . Like CXCR4 , CXCR7 is induced by hypoxia , and is associated with poor prognosis and metastasis in cancers [ 926 , 927 , 928 ] . CXCR7 may also aid angiogenesis [ 929 ] . 12G5 has been shown not to inhibit CXCL12 - induced chemotaxis in a T - cell - line expressing CXCR7 but not CXCR4 [ 106 ] , suggesting CXCR7 could be influencing results reported here . 8 . 3 . 5 : NSC23766 can displace CXCR4 antibody 12G5 Various explanations for the chemotaxis and flow cytometry results with NSC23766 , AMD3100 and ATI2341 are plausible , figures 8 . 12 and 8 . 14 . However NSC23766 is unlikely to be triggering internalisation as results at 37°C and 4°C are similar ; 4°C should prevent active internalisation . NSC23766 may be causing a conformation change of the receptor acting through Rac1 , and so cause a loss of 12G5 binding , as has been suggested by others [ 930 ] , but then a greater effect of W56 would be expected and Rac direct inhibitor ETH1864 has no effect , figure 8 . 15 . The effects of 244 NSC23766 are similar at 37°C and 4°C , this suggests NSC23766 is displacing 12G5 from the receptor ; also treatment with NSC23766 after 12G5 and FITC staining causes greater effects than pre - treatment of cells . This may suggest that NSC23766 rapidly binds or allosterically modulates CXCR4 , but its affinity weakens over the 2 hours of primary and secondary antibody staining , suggesting if it binds CXCR4 directly affinity is much lower than that of CXCL12 or 12G5 . ATI2341 5 μM produces non - significant effects at 37°C or 4°C . AMD3100 5 μM however causes greater loss of CXCR4 in absence of CXCL12 than NSC23766 , but does not hinder CXCL12 internalisation like NSC23766 at 37°C , and AMD3100 does not cause any significant internalisation at 4°C , suggesting AMD3100 and NSC23766 have very different modes of action and that NSC23766 is not simply acting as a CXCR4 antagonist or a Rac1 GEF inhibitor . The promiscuity of NSC23766 has been previously reported . Examples include : acting as an antagonist at NMDA and Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors [ 901 , 902 ] ; acting to modulate p21 - activated kinase ( PAK ) 1 and PAK2 , and inhibiting activation and glycoprotein 1b signalling in Rac1 ( - / - ) platelets [ 931 ] ; and acting to inhibit the phosphorylation of NF - κB and cyclin D 1 in prostate cancer cells and directly inhibiting the phosphorylation of Rac1 , albeit at 200 μM [ 932 ] . NSC23766 and EHT1864 , figures 8 . 34 and 8 . 15B , can also both modulate glucose - stimulated insulin secretion [ 933 ] . 8 . 3 . 6 : Endocytosis inhibitors do not prevent NSC23766 triggered CXCR4 internalisation Sucrose treatment significantly increased CXCR4 expression in control , 8 . 16B , but did not prevent the NSC23766 , AMD3100 or CXCL12 causing CXCR4 signal loss . Hyperosmotic sucrose at 0 . 4 M reportedly non - selectively inhibits GPCR internalisation , causes strong ERK activation [ 934 ] and may induce phosphorylation of p38MAPK causing pathway activation [ 935 , 936 ] . Cell surface receptors can be internalised via clathrin - dependent or clathrin - independent , lipid raft and calveolae - dependent endocytosis . With the former the clathrin - coated pit is pinched off by dynamin and other proteins to form clathrin - coated vesicles which then fuse with early endosomes and recycle back to the surface or via late endosomes are degraded in lysosomes . Alternatively lipid raft / calveolae - dependent endocytosis occurs [ 937 ] . Binding of CXCL12 to CXCR4 is reported to cause ubiquitation of receptor followed by degradation in lysosomes [ 715 , 938 ] . Sucrose at 0 . 4 M appears unable to prevent this process in presence of 15 nM CXCL12 , but did very significantly ( p < 0 . 001 ) increase CXCR4 expression in absence of CXCL12 . . Sodium azide failed to modify CXCR4 expression in Jurkat , figure 8 . 16A . Sodium Azide reportedly inhibits ATP hydrolysis by inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria , the major source of ATP production in eukaryotes . Mitochondria contribute to gluconeogenesis , heme synthesis and the urea cycle , and are the location of the tricarboxylic acid cycle , β - oxidation of fatty acids , 245 ketogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation . Oxidative phosphorylation involves electrons being passed down a chain of enzyme complexes in a series of redox reactions that release energy [ 939 ] . Sodium azide reportedly blocks cytochrome C oxidase ( aka Complex IV ) the last enzyme of respiratory electron transport chain ; sodium azide binds between iron and copper ions in the cytochrome C oxidase’s oxygen reduction site [ 940 ] . Cytochrome C oxidase receives and then transfers electrons to oxygen to make water and transport protons into the mitochondria intermembrane space . ATP synthase ( aka F - ATPase and Complex V ) then uses the proton gradient between the intermembrane space and the matrix to drive ATP production from ADP and inorganic phosphate [ 941 ] . However this experiment was completed using Jurkat , a cancer T - cell line . Mitochondrial metabolism has been shown to provide the necessary reactive oxygen species for antigen - specific T - cell activation in non - transformed cells [ 942 ] . Jurkat are a rapidly proliferating cell line . Proliferating cells have vastly increased metabolic requirements to quiescent ones . When activated non - transformed ( healthy ) T - cells increase glucose metabolism , they take up large amounts of glucose from their environment while also producing lactate . That is , they are primarily glycolytic via aerobic glycolysis [ 943 - 945 ] . Hence glycolysis provides ATP and fuels the pentose phosphate pathway generating NADPH and nucleotides . Activated non - transformed T - cells also increase glutamine metabolism to fuel the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle via glutaminolysis to α - ketoglutarate [ 946 , 947 ] . Cancer cells can flourish in conditions that would cause apoptosis of non - transformed healthy cells , for example in conditions of low pH or oxygen tension [ 948 ] , this is because they preferentially generate ATP by glycolysis followed by cytosolic lactic acid fermentation rather than oxidative phosphorylation ; oxygen can actually inhibit this process , which is known as the Warburg effect [ 949 ] . Tumour cells run glycolysis , which does not use oxygen , at much higher rates than normal cells to acquire the necessary ATP for rapid proliferation . If they used mitochondrial production to generate the required levels of ATP they would also generate levels of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , a normal by - product of oxidative phosphorylation that would be toxic to the cells . Normally oxygen and ATP would inhibit phosphofuctokinae - 1 , the enzyme controlling the rate of glycolysis . But the Warburg effect allows the tumour cell ( i ) to accelerate glycolysis in presence of oxygen and ( ii ) to convert the end product of glycolysis , pyruvate , to lactate even in the presence of normal levels of oxygen . Lactate production then allows the necessary regeneration of NAD + . Lactate itself may stimulate signalling that stimulates tumour growth [ 950 ] . 246 Hence the FAC results obtained following sodium azide pre - treatment , figure 8 . 16A , suggest the Jurkat were predominantly generating energy via glycolysis , not oxidative phosphorylation , as may be expected with a fast replicating cancer cell - line . 8 . 3 . 7 : cAMP levels are reduced by NSC23766 but not by AMD3100 AMD3100 can act as a competitive orthosteric unbiased antagonist of CXCR4 , figure 8 . 3 shows 1 μM can strongly inhibit chemotaxis to CXCL12 . AMD3100 can inhibit CXCR4 endocytosis and both β - arrestin and Gαi signalling [ 951 ] but can over time promote CXCR4 upregulation of CXCR4 so drug resistance and even increased responses to CXCL12 [ 952 ] . Here surprisingly 5 μM AMD3100 failed to significantly modify cAMP production in Jurkat , pre - treated with 20 μM Forskolin plus IBMX , and stimulated by 10 nM CXCL12 , figure 8 . 17 . Hitchinson et al . ( 2018 ) also investigated the effects of AMD3100 on Jurkat cAMP production triggered by CXCL12 . They used 100 μM Forskolin , 30 nM CXCL12 and AMD3100 ( strength not stated ) and saw a small ( p < 0 . 05 ) loss of reduction of cAMP in AMD3100 / CXCL12 treated cells compared to control [ 953 ] . Mechanisms for the discrepancies include that AMD3100 at low concentrations ( 0 . 1 - 1 μM ) may act as a weak partial agonist [ 954 ] , and / or that other receptors were playing a role . However the artificial nature of Forskolin activation of adenylyl cyclase and IBMX phosphodiesterase inhibition of cAMP breakdown , noted by others as obvious possible sources of error [ 955 ] may have obscured AMD3100 responses . NSC23766 produced a very significant ( p < 0 . 001 ) reduction in basal cAMP levels , figure 8 . 17 . Basal levels of cAMP may relate to numbers of receptors on the cell surface [ 956 ] . CXCL12 binds CXCR4 but also CXCR7 , Jurkat express CXCR7 at high levels as well as CXCR4 [ 957 ] . CXCL12 binding CXCR4 activates canonical G αi signalling , reducing cAMP levels . CXCR7 activation does not . However CXCR7 / CXCR4 heterodimer formation prioritises activation of β - arrestins over G αi signalling [ 958 ] , suggesting CXCR7 can regulate coupling of CXCR4 to G αi and thus cAMP levels [ 928 ] . If NSC23766 prevents CXCR4 / CXCR7 heterodimer formation , increasing CXCR4 monomers on the cell surface it could increase basal CXCR4 Gαi signalling , and cAMP levels would fall , this could explain results . If both CXCR4 and CXCR7 are expressed then Ca 2 + mobilisation may be greater that if just CXCR4 are present , as CXCR7 may enable CXCR4 - G αi conformational rearrangements supporting both CXCL12 - induced chemotaxis and calcium flux [ 958 ] , possibly explaining figures 8 . 20 - 8 . 22 . Interestingly NSC23766 more strongly inhibited Ca 2 + flux than the CXCR4 inhibitors ATI2341 or AMD3100 , figure 8 . 23 . These results therefore do not preclude that NSC23766 is binding CXCR7 rather than CXCR4 or acting as a biased ligand . 247 8 . 3 . 8 : Biased signalling Different ligands binding the same receptor can produce specific conformations that trigger initiation of only a specific subset of the receptor’s many possible signalling cascades . This is termed biased agonism or functional selectivity . Equally allosteric ligands can produce biased modulation of biased agonism [ 959 , 960 ] . The underlying molecular basis for biased agonism is complex and not fully understood [ 961 ] . In vivo other biases may add to the complexities ; circadian rhythms and pathology including cancer affect natural ligand / receptor stoichiometry and may for example change cell expression of G - protein γ subunits [ 962 , 963 ] . Therefore computer modelling analysis of binding sites based on assays in any one cell - line or transfected system are unlikely to be universally applicable , and could mislead future research . 8 . 3 . 9 : cAMP levels may modulate PKCζ signalling Unlike AMD3100 or ATI2341 , NSC23766 reduced both basal and post - CXCL12 stimulation cAMP levels compared to control , figure 8 . 17 . Increasing cAMP levels increases Ras GTPase Rap1 - GTP , hence Rap - 1 activation [ 964 ] . Inhibiting Rap - 1 decreases CXCR4 expression at the membrane so Rap - 1 - GTP appears to be required for cAMP - induced CXCR4 - increased membrane expression . PKA inhibitor H89 was found here to significantly increase cAMP production , figure 8 . 17 . Others note H89 failed to prevent CXCR4 expression [ 906 ] . PKCζ is involved in cAMP signalling , as increasing cAMP increases PKCζ phosphorylation and activation [ 965 ] . Rap1 affects signalling upstream of PKCζ translocation to the membrane [ 906 ] . Rap1 recruits Rac1 GEFs including Tiam1 . Active Rac1 triggers translocation and activation of PKCζ . Blocking Rac1 by NSC23766 can inhibit cAMP - induced PKCζ phosphorylation , suggesting Rac1 is required for PKCζ activation by cAMP [ 964 , 966 ] . Thus PKCζ has a role in cAMP - activated CXCR4 expression . Inhibiting PKCζ activity inhibits CXCR4 expression at the membrane ; upregulating PKCζ increases CXCR4 expression . Inhibiting Rac1 activation has the same effect as blocking PKCζ activity , suggesting Rac1 and PKCζ are in the same signalling pathway influencing CXCR4 membrane expression , possibly by reducing CXCR4 endocytosis . Hence in the absence of CXCL12 cAMP prolongs CXCR4’s stay at the membrane , and increasing cAMP levels increases CXCR4 recycling back to the membrane [ 906 ] . PKCζ is activated by binding to the Par activity complex containing Par6 , Par3 and Cdc42 ; Rac1 binds Par6 to activate PKCζ [ 967 ] . Therefore there appears to be a feedback loop between PKCζ activation by cAMP causing elevated CXCR4 expression which itself increases PKCζ activity , figure 8 . 35 . 248 Figure 8 . 35 : Schematic representation of cAMP , PKCζ , Rac1 and CXCR4 expression feedback loop [ 906 , 964 ] . 8 . 3 . 9 . 1 : PKCζ knockdown inhibits CCL3 and CXCL12 MCF7 wound - healing and Jurkat chemotaxis to CXCL12 The cAMP results , figure 8 . 17 , suggest that NSC23766 is stimulating Gαi signalling from CXCR4 , which is inhibiting adenylyl cyclase hence reducing cAMP levels . The addition of CXCL12 increases the Gα i signal , reducing cAMP levels further . If NSC23766 was purely inhibiting Tiam1 it would be expected to reduce Rac1 activation of PKCζ / Par3 / Par6 / Cdc42 complex and possibly reduce CXCR4 membrane expression and Gα i inhibitory signalling , increasing cAMP levels . The signalling may be complicated by the reported constitutively active signalling of Pi3K in Jurkat cells [ 647 , 968 , 969 ] , so any effect on Tiam1 by NSC23766 , figure 8 . 35 , may be mitigated , but direct effects of NSC23766 on CXCR4 would not . 8 . 3 . 9 . 2 : Both PKCζ over - expression and inactivation can support malignancies PKCζ knockdown was found to inhibit both CXCL12 supported chemotaxis in Jurkat and chemokinesis in MCF7 , confirming the proteins role in promoting CXCR4 signalling in these cell - lines , figures 8 . 18 - 8 . 19 . PKCζ’s roles in cancers are complex . PKCζ down - regulation has been found to promote malignancy in pancreatic [ 970 ] , lung [ 971 ] , and prostate cancers [ 972 ] . However PKCζ deletion increases prostate cancer invasiveness if Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog ( PTEN ) is lacking [ 973 ] . Possibly as PKCζ silencing can also promote invasion and growth in some cell - lines as PKCζ may conversely act as a tumour suppressor in some breast cancers , PKCζ may through IL - 6 modulation counteracting adverse transformed Ras - signalling [ 971 ] . αi cAMP Epac1 Rap1 - GTP Tiam1 PKCζ + - GTP Rac1 - GDP Rac1 Par6 PKA AC Pi3K 249 PKCζ can be inactive in colon cancers resulting in poor prognosis [ 974 ] but PKCζ loss in colon cancer can increase transcription of β - catenin in crypt stem cells leading to malignancy [ 975 ] . LOF of PKCζ is also found in some breast cancers , and PKCζ appears essential for stem cell homeostasis . These contradictory findings may be due to effects of PDPK1 , an upstream regulator of all PKCs . Rapamycin ( sirolimus ) , temsirolimus and everolimus inhibit mTOR signalling , which is involved in activation of all novel and conventional PKCs . PDPK1 and mTOR phosphorylate all PKCs on conserved sequences [ 976 ] . Inhibiting mTOR can inhibit breast cancer growth yet these drugs are also immunosuppressants inhibiting cytokine - responsive T - lymphocyte activation and proliferation , and so resistance develops [ 262 ] . 8 . 3 . 10 : Intracellular calcium , PLC and Rac1 Intracellular calcium can act as a second messenger in signalling cascades . Resting intracellular calcium concentrations are usually far lower than extracellular levels . This is achieved by pumping calcium from the cytosol into the extracellular space and into the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , also by proteins and organelles in the cytosol sequestering Ca 2 + . GPCR stimulation can indirectly trigger opening of ion channels allowing Ca 2 + to flood into the cytosol from the ER and / or extracellular space , triggering signalling cascades [ 977 ] . In T - cells phospholipase C ( PLC ) gamma can be activated by GPCR triggered Ca 2 + signalling . PLC hydrolyses membrane phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) forming inositol 1 , 4 , 5 triphosphate ( IP 3 ) and diacylglycerol ( DAG ) . DAG can then recruit PKC to the cell membrane while IP 3 binds IP 3 receptors opening Ca 2 + channels on the ER . This activates STIM1 , an ER Ca 2 + sensor , and finally Orai1 channels , the main T - cell SOCC , open . The IP 3 channels opening and releasing ER Ca 2 + may trigger PKC activation , and intracellular Ca 2 + may activate calcium - calmodulin kinase pathways which can trigger dephosphorylation and activation of transcription factors [ 977 ] . Intracellular calcium signalling is accepted as a cellular second messenger system that links to chemokine receptor activation , and to the activation of Rho GTPases [ 978 ] . Relationships between Rac and calcium signalling are thought to be dependent on cell type , and signalling trigger . For example in neutrophils Rac activation triggered by chemokines can be independent of intracellular calcium [ 979 ] , and T - cells carry several varieties of calcium channels at the cell and / or ER membrane [ 977 ] . NSC23766 may be acting via inhibiting Tiam1 , which activates Rac1 and so influences the PLC - IP 3 pathway explained above , or via direct inhibition of CXCL12 / CXCR4 activation . NSC23766 was found to increase Ca 2 + flux in THP - 1 triggered by CCL3 but reduce response from CXCL12 , figure 8 . 20 . In Jurkat and MCF7 NSC23766 done - dependently competed with CXCL12 inhibiting Ca 2 + flux , 250 figures 8 . 21 and 8 . 22 . These results suggest NSC23766 has a direct effect on CXCL12 / CXCR4 but not CCL3 signalling . Indeed it more effectively inhibited Ca2 + production than either CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 or ATI2341 , figure 8 . 23 . PLC inhibition was achieved using U73122 , figures 8 . 24 and 8 . 25 . U73122 inhibits PLC so can reduce IP 3 production in neutrophils [ 980 , 981 ] , although U73122 has also been found to potentiate IP 3 - mediated Ca 2 + release [ 982 ] , figure 8 . 36 . Here it statistically increases Ca 2 + production in Jurkat , figure 8 . 25 . Figure 8 . 36 : Involvement of Rac1 , PLC , PKC and Slingshot ( SSH1 ) in GPCR calcium signalling . SSH1 can be activated by two routes , rapidly through calcineurin and more slowly through Rac1 - Pi3K . SSH1 phosphatase phosphorylates cofilin [ 977 , 983 ] . U73122 behaved similarly in THP - 1 and Jurkat chemotaxis to NSC23766 , reinforcing evidence for specificity of Rac1 signalling in CXCL12 but not CCL3 chemotaxis , figures 8 . 2 and 8 . 24 , however U73122 produced opposite effects on cAMP responses both before and after CXCL12 compared to NSC23766 , figures 8 . 26A and 8 . 17 , suggesting NSC23766 off - targets effects . 8 . 3 . 11 : NSC23766 inhibits both early and late cofilin phosphorylation events in response to CXCL12 The temporal early responses of cofilin phosphorylation observed , figure 8 . 29 , may be attributable to Ca 2 + dependent cofilin re - phosphorylation , and the later ones to Rho - kinase / LIMK signalling . Rac1 inhibition was shown above to inhibit CXCL12 - induced calcium flux , figures 8 . 20 - α IP 3 Ca 2 + Ca 2 + ORAI1 Ca 2 + Ca 2 + Gene regulation Ca 2 + Ca 2 + IP 3 R + DAG PKC Tiam1 - GTP Rac1 Ca 2 + Ca 2 + Ca 2 + P Rac1 Pi3K PIP 2 PLCγ nucleus + 251 8 . 22 , indicating Rac1 activation may be calcium - dependent . Cofilin phosphorylation in other cells has been reported as calcium dependent , mediated through PAKs ; phosphatase Slingshot can be activated by calcineurin [ 893 ] . PKC may function upstream , and Pi3K downstream of Rac1 , Pi3K can stimulate SSH1 activity , figure 8 . 36 . PKC can phosphorylate Tiam1 activating Rac1 , however both PKC - independent and dependent pathways may trigger cofilin phosphorylation [ 643 , 984 ] . Early changes in cofilin phosphorylation may also be involved with cell secretion ; cofilin inactivation may reduce the constraints of actin cytoskeleton on monocyte secretion as vesicle - membrane fusions involves actin polymerization [ 985 , 986 ] . 8 . 3 . 12 : Rac1 may be involved in CXCL11 but not CCL2 or CXCL9 chemotaxis CCL2 aka Monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1 ( MCP - 1 ) has both chemotactic and activating properties [ 987 ] . Rac1 is important for membrane ruffles formation as well as lamellipodia . Ruffles are instrumental in the formation of the phagocytic cup employed when macrophages phagocytose apoptotic cells , a process known as efferocytosis . CCL2 is reported to enhance efferocytosis through a CCL2 / Rac1 / Pi3K pathway in acute inflammation , and NSC23766 at 50 μM can inhibit this in mouse macrophages [ 988 ] . Others have implicated Rac1 activation in CCL2 chemotaxis in CHO cells [ 989 ] . However , here in THP - 1 neither NSC23766 at 100 μM or W56 at 280 μM significantly inhibited chemotaxis to CCL2 . However both inhibitors significantly reduced chemotaxis induced by CXCL11 but not CXCL9 , suggesting Rac1 activation is involved in CXCL11 - triggered chemotaxis in THP - 1 , or NSC23766 may be having off target effects on CXCR7 , which also binds CXCL11 . CXCL11 , aka I - TAC , and CXCL9 are both ligands for CXCR3 , but CXCL11 binds with higher affinity [ 990 ] . The different ligands trigger different downstream pathways and receptor locations ; CXCR9 activation involves serine / threonine residues on CXCR3 C - terminus whereas CXCL11 involves CXCR3 ICL3 [ 991 ] . CXCL11 / CXCR3 signalling involves p70 kinase / mTOR STAT3 and STAT6 whereas CXCL9 / CXCR3 signals via STAT1 and STAT5 , an example of ligand - biased signalling [ 992 ] . The receptor CXCR3 is known to have two isoforms termed CXCR3 - A and CXCR3 - B . In malignancy CXCL11 binding CXCR3 - A or CXCR7 triggers proliferation , but CXCL11 binding CXCR3 - B inhibits tumour growth [ 993 ] . Ligands for CXCR3 , CXCR4 and CXCR7 can be expressed by malignant cells , although only CXCR4 is accepted as a cancer stem cell marker [ 994 , 995 ] . What is more complex to analyse is the outcome of signalling cross - talk and reported dimerization of CXCR4 and CXCR7 [ 958 ] , which may involve G - proteins or biased signalling through β - arrestin [ 996 , 997 ] , or CXCL14 [ 919 ] . CXCL12 can be secreted by cells as monomers or dimers , and can dimerize once secreted . Monomeric CXCL12 may preferentially activate CXCR4 signalling via Gαi and Akt whereas dimeric 252 CXCL12 signals via β - arrestin - 2 recruitment to CXCR4 . CXCR7 may only bind monomeric CXCL12 [ 998 ] . Although CXCR7 binds both CXCL11 and CXCL12 neither partnership produces classical heterotrimeric G - protein signalling [ 113 ] , but they have been shown to stimulate signalling via the recruitment of β - arrestin , and produce ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation . The presence of CXCR7 on immune cells such as monocytes was initially reported using an antibody approach , then challenged due to suggested limitations of the antibody , before being confirmed by proteomic evidence [ 999 - 1001 ] . CXCR7 has been shown to dimerize with CXCR4 , modulating CXCR4 - CXCL12 signalling [ 958 ] , and to play a role in murine haematopoietic stem cell development and so may also do so in humans [ 1002 ] . CXCR7 may also act as a sponge for CXCL11 and CXCL12 maintaining the gradient essential for chemotaxis [ 41 , 1003 ] . Figure 8 . 30B may provide evidence that CXCR3 is involved in THP - 1 migration stimulated by CXCL11 , or that CXCL11 binding CXCR7 in monocytes can stimulate migration , and that NSC23766 may be inhibiting the actions of CXCR7 . 8 . 3 . 13 : NSC23766 may potentiate CXCL14 inhibition of Jurkat chemotaxis to CXCL12 CXCL14 is found in and produced by healthy epithelial tissues and macrophages , its expression can be reduced by inflammation , and malignancy [ 916 , 1004 ] . Although chemotactic to most types of white blood cells , T - cells are not attracted to CXCL14 [ 1005 ] . CXCL14 appears to be an indirect [ 1006 ] or direct ligand for CXCR4 [ 1005 ] but reportedly also interacts with other proteins / receptors [ 914 ] . Collins et al . ( 2017 ) found that CXCL14 can displace bound CXCL12 , but CXCL12 is less efficient at displacing CXCL14 [ 919 ] , this may explain why here in figure 8 . 31A pre - treatment with CXCL14 had more of a dose - dependent effect than the same concentrations of CXCL14 combined with CXCL12 as chemoattractant , figure 8 . 31B . Research suggests 300 nM CXCL14 can potentiate chemotaxis to 0 . 1 - 1 nM CXCL12 in PMBC’s [ 919 ] . PMBC’s include NK - cells and monocytes which migrate to CXCL14 , as well as pre - B and T - cells which may not . Conversely Collins et al . found CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 ( 10 μM ) pre - treatment did not prevent monocyte migration to a high concentration ( 1 μM ) CXCL14 , and that CXCL14 did not activate CXCR4 - associated signalling events [ 919 ] , suggesting CXCL14 - induced chemotaxis in monocytes employs a receptor , protein or chemokine partner other than CXCR4 . The effects of CXCL14 on metastasis may depend on the degree of mitochondrial dysfunction present in malignant cells . Dysfunction in mitochondrial respiration has been shown to promote CXCL14 expression . CXCL14 binding inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum producing elevation of intracellular Ca 2 + may promote cell motility and invasion [ 1007 ] . Explaining how CXCL14 could perform a useful role in immune surveillance but also promote 253 metastases . Here CXCL14 100 nM pre - treatment significantly increased responses to CXCL12 / CXCR4 coupling to Gαi , producing elevation of intracellular calcium in Jurkat , figure 8 . 32 . Others saw similar Ca 2 + responses to CXCL12 / CXCL14 combinations , along with elevation of Rac - GTP in murine CXCR4 - transfected cells [ 919 ] . Here using flow cytometry and Jurkat , figure 8 . 33 , Rac1 inhibition with W56 did not modulate CXCL14 responses , but NSC23766 significantly did , again suggesting NSC23766 can allosterically modulate CXCR4 or a receptor forming dimers with CXCR4 . Collins et al . ( 2017 ) concluded that synergism between CXCL12 and CXCL14 is dependent on CXCR4 dimer / oligomerization , CXCL14 binding one CXCR4 partner facilitating CXCL12 binding other . However their cells only expressed CXCR4 , so could only form CXCR4 homodimers . THP - 1 and healthy monocytes express little CXCR7 [ 1008 ] , whereas Jurkat highly express CXCR7 [ 957 ] , so Jurkat may express more CXCR4 / CXCR7 heterodimers or oligomers than CXCR4 homodimers or oligomers . CXCL14 binding the CXCR4 component of a CXCR4 / CXCR7 dimer would block CXCL12 binding , so inhibit migration , which is what figure 8 . 31 illustrates . Whereas in monocytes , CXCL14 binding one component of a CXCR4 homodimer could then facilitate CXCL12 binding other CXCR4 and thus expedite chemotaxis , in vitro concentration of the two chemokines and cell - line appears key . 8 . 4 : Conclusions THP - 1 express CXCR4 but possibly little CXCR7 [ 1008 ] , this may explain why NSC23766 had less effect on CXCL12 chemotaxis in THP - 1 than in Jurkat where CXCR7 is highly expressed [ 957 ] . Here THP - 1 were shown to also express CCR5 , chapter 3 , figure 3 . 3 . Overall NSC23766 was shown to inhibit CXCL12 - induced chemotaxis , chemokinesis and calcium mobilisation in Jurkat , THP - 1 and MCF7 , figures 8 . 2 , 8 . 6 , 8 . 20 - 8 . 23 ; also to significantly reduce basal cAMP levels in Jurkat , figure 8 . 17 . One explanation for these results is that NSC23766 may be allosterically inhibiting CXCR4 by binding and inactivating CXCR7 . Contrastingly NSC23766 increased THP - 1 chemotaxis and calcium mobilisation to CCL3 , acting as a partial agonist , figures 8 . 2B and 8 . 20A . Possible mechanisms include acting on CXCR4 affecting CXCR4 / CCR5 dimers or by acting on CXCR7 . CXCR4 - CCR5 modulate T - cell functions but recent research suggesting CXCR7 - targeting may block HIV entry into cells [ 1009 ] . This raises the question could CXCR7 also modulate CCL3 / CCR5 induced chemotaxis ? NSC23766 had significantly different effects to AMD3100 and ATI2341 on cAMP basal levels and those following CXCL12 suggesting it was not targeting CXCR4 but either preventing CXCR4 / CXCR7 dimerization or targeting CXCR7 . CXCR7 is upregulated in cancer cells and present in Jurkat [ 957 ] . 254 NSC23766 targeting CXCR7 may explain not only cAMP results but also results from the chemotaxis , calcium , and internalisation assays . As CXCR7 has been shown to signal through Gαi in some cell types [ 110 ] , so may do in others , and to produce hetero - oligomers with CXCR4 [ 1010 ] . Such hetero - oligomers may , depending on conditions and cell type , increase or decrease Ca 2 + flux following CXCL12 stimulation and alter ERK activation and chemotaxis . Mechanisms may include CXCR7 altering CXCR4 - Gαi interactions and / or sequestering CXCL12 ; in vivo CXCR7 sequestering appears to maintain CXCR4 sensitivity to CXCL12 supporting metastasis [ 958 , 1011 ] . The CXCR7 ligand CCX771 has been found to more potentially inhibit CXCL12 migration than AMD3100 [ 1010 ] , similarly here AMD3100 , at the concentration used failed to inhibit cAMP responses as much as NSC23766 . Others have seen little effect of AMD3100 on cAMP production boosted by Forskolin [ 953 ] . CXCR7 / CXCR4 co - expression can decrease CXCL12 stimulated Gαi - mediated cAMP reduction [ 928 ] therefore if NSC23766 either inactivates CXCR7 or prevents CXCR4 / CXCR7 dimer or oligomer formation this would explain why NSC23766 was able to reduce basal cAMP levels and those in the presence of CXCL12 , figure 8 . 17 . NSC23766 also reduced CXCL12 chemotaxis , when CXCR7 is inhibited so would β - arrestin responses that have been shown here , chapter 5 , figure 5 . 33 and by others [ 1012 ] to significantly increase chemotaxis to CXCL12 . Overall Rac1 was found important for CXCL12 chemotaxis but less essential for chemotaxis to CCL3 , figure 8 . 2 and results hint receptor oligomerisation involving CXCR7 may mediate chemotaxis to CCL3 . CXCR7 purportedly sequesters CXCL12 , so CXCR7 may function to modify chemokine concentrations during in vitro assays . Also inhibition of a signalling protein may modify the concentration of chemokine needed to produce chemotaxis , chemokinesis or calcium flux . Thus figure 8 . 22 may illustrate an inhibitor simply modifying the concentration of a chemokine needed to achieve calcium flux . The balance of CXCR4 / CXCR4 homodimers or CXCR4 / CXCR7 heterodimers may influence whether CXCL14 inhibits or expedites chemotaxis to CXCL12 , the high expression of CXCR7 in Jurkat [ 957 ] may explain why CXCL14 inhibits their chemotaxis to CXCL12 , figure 8 . 31 . Also CXCL14 may be synergistic to CXCL12 - induced Ca 2 + responses by mediating by endoplasmic reticulum inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate receptors [ 1007 ] , explaining figure 8 . 32 . Flow cytometry in Jurkat demonstrated CXCL14 significantly increase CXCR4 signal loss produced by NSC23766 , figure 8 . 33 , this could be explained by CXCL14 binding CXCR4 and NSC23766 binding CXCR7 component of CXCR4 / CXCR7 dimers . 255 9 : General Conclusions These are some of the many interesting conclusions that can be drawn from the research reported in this thesis . THP - 1 and MCF7 were found to express both CCR5 and CXCR4 . THP - 1 migrated towards many CC and CXC chemokines ; Jurkat only to CXCL12 . In both cases numbers of cells migrating to a range of chemokine concentrations produced Gaussian distributions , with modest concentrations of chemokines being the most chemotactic . Spaks ( 2017 ) reports that chemokine concentrations can correlate with both the numbers of immune cells infiltrating a tumour’s microenvironment and chemokine receptor expression [ 1013 ] . This thesis contributes towards a better understanding of the chemokine concentrations that attract immune and cancer cells , knowledge necessary to enable therapeutic manipulation of the chemotactic responses that support metastases . In THP - 1 , CCL3 plus CXCL12 produced additive chemotactic responses , whereas CCL2 plus CXCL11 does not , suggesting CCR5 and CXCR4 may dimerize to support migration but CCR2 and CXCR3 do not . When different chemokines bind the same chemokine receptor the specific receptor conformation changes may direct the GRK subtype recruited , and which serine / threonine receptor residues it phosphorylates and so directing resultant biased signalling through G - proteins or β - arrestins . GRK2 was identified as important to both CCL3 - and CXCL12 - induced migration ; Arrestin - 2 as more important for CXCL12 - induced migration and Arrestin - 3 for migration to CCL3 , depending on cell type . Gahbauer et al . ( 2018 ) and many others report that biased agonism and receptor dimerization relate to the agonist molecular structure , as different agonists may stabilise different GPCR conformations and consequent cellular responses [ 1014 , 1015 ] . This thesis provides further evidence for links between GPCR class and β - arrestin isotype , but also cell - type specific factors . It also adds evidence for the involvement of receptor dimerization and co - operation in chemokine - induced chemotaxis and hence contributes to a better understanding of chemokine receptor interplay in malignancies . Dynamin is a key protein in endocytosis . Dynamin was visualised in the cytoplasm and nucleus ; knockdown of Dynamin - 2 and small molecule inhibitors demonstrated Dynamin’s significance in cytokinesis and cell migration . Different Dynamin domains were found important for migration to different chemokines , the GTPase domain for migration to CCL3 and the PH domain for migration to CXCL12 . Bazzani et al . ( 2018 ) has established that both clathrin and caveolin - mediated endocytosis depends on Dynamin , and that blocking endocytosis with Dynamin inhibitors can prevent receptor endocytosis that would enhance malignant cell proliferation [ 1016 ] . Results here suggest cell type and chemokine specific control over which ligand / receptor pairs undergo 256 endocytosis may be achieved by using different Dynamin inhibitors , a novel option to explore further . PKC’s role in cell migration was found to be isoform , cell type and chemokine specific . Results with small molecule PKC inhibitors were deceptive , suggesting only PKCμ was important , but siRNA knockdown of PKC isoforms clarified the importance of PKCα and PKCδ , and to a lesser extent of PKCε and PKCζ . Each isoform’s importance was resolved along with chemokine and / or cell type specificities . Isakov ( 2017 ) reviewed how many tumours have altered PKC expression or mutation of PKC isoform / s [ 262 ] . Results here show how this links to chemokine signalling through two important chemokines implicated in cancers , CXCL12 and CCL3 , information which may help open windows for therapeutic exploitation . Extensive use of small molecule inhibitors established that both CCL3 and CXCL12 signalling employs Src and the Raf / MEK / ERK pathway . Research by others has recognised Src’s importance in CXCL12 - supported malignancy [ 555 , 576 ] . Results in this thesis suggest it may also be important in responses of cancer cells to CCL3 . Investigations also discovered synergism between inhibition of ROCK and Raf , and also between MEK and Raf . Pi3K and FAK appear key in CXCL12 - but not CCL3 - signal transduction leading to cell migration , whereas ROCK and MEK are important in both CCL3 and CXCL12 - induced migration ; all three proteins influence cofilin phosphorylation . This demonstrates that CXCL12 - and CCL3 - signalling uses diverse pathways to trigger chemotaxis , but also that signalling protein use by a specific receptor / chemokine pair can be very individual to the chemokine and cell - type . This lack of generalisation needs further investigations but suggests opportunities for the further development of synergistic chemotherapies . In MCF7 siRNA knockdown of actin binding protein Cofilin established its importance to cell migration . In THP - 1 Cofilin phosphorylation showed positive correlation with the ability of a chemokine to induce migration . Also this phosphorylation can be modified by inhibition of cytosolic signalling proteins , and so can confirm the relevance of any individual signalling protein to a signalling pathway triggered by a specific chemokine . This offers a novel readout method that can be used alongside other assays to clarify chemokine signalling pathway components . JAK2 and STAT3 were found to support CXCL12 - induced wound - healing in MCF7 and chemotaxis to CCL2 and CXCL12 in THP - 1 but not migration to CXCL12 in Jurkat . Inhibition of JAK2 and STAT3 potentiated calcium flux in all three cell types and blunted cAMP falls in THP - 1 in response to CCL2 stimulation . Forskolin , employed in cAMP assays , also independently inhibited cell migration and wound - healing to CXCL12 and produced cofilin phosphorylation . In THP - 1 JAK2 and STAT3 257 inhibitors were found to alter the temporal cofilin phosphorylation pattern produced between one and thirty minutes after CXCL12 stimulation , this cofilin phosphorylation pattern correlated with STAT3 phosphorylation responses to CXCL12 . Roussos et al . ( 2011 ) described the role of cofilin in the amoeboid migration mode of adherent breast cancer cells [ 1017 ] , the results here show how temporal phosphorylation of cofilin operates in the chemotaxis of leukaemic cells to chemokines . This research also suggests Forskolin shows promise as an anti - metastatic adjunctive treatment in chemotherapy , and further elucidates JAK2 and STAT3 signalling in both leukaemic and breast cancer cell - lines . The NSAIDs ibuprofen , naproxen and celecoxib , along with Aspirin and Paracetamol , were found to have varying effects on cell migration , cAMP levels and calcium dynamics . COX1 inhibitors Ibuprofen , Naproxen and Aspirin inhibited migration to CXCL12 , whereas COX2 inhibitors Paracetamol and Celecoxib did not . Ibuprofen dramatically increased cofilin phosphorylation , whereas the other drugs all eliminated CXCL12 - induced phosphorylation , possibly as Ibuprofen may have off - target inhibitory effects on Akt or MEK . Often in population and retrospective cohort studies the effects of NSAIDs and Aspirin on cancer initiation and progression is assessed by grouping the drugs into one study [ 1018 - 1020 ] , this thesis shows why such a strategy may give unclear outcomes , as each can produce contrasting drug - specific effects on factors that may influence metastasis . Rac1 GEF inhibitor NSC23766 was found to compete with 12G5 for CXCR4 . This was confirmed by flow cytometry , where NSC23766 displaced CXCR4 antibody 12G5 . NSC23766 also dose - dependently inhibited calcium flux triggered by CXCL12 , and reduced cAMP levels in presence and absence of CXCL12 , whereas CXCR4 ligands AMD3100 and ATI2341 did not . Rho GTPases include Cdc42 and Rac1 . Results here show Cdc42 is involved in CXCL12 - and CCL3 - induced chemotaxis whereas Rac1 is involved in migration to CXCL12 but not CCL3 , this was confirmed by use of a Rac - inhibiting peptide . Inhibition of CXCR4 , using NSC23766 , AMD3100 and ATI2341 was shown to impede both cell - migration to CXCL12 and Rac1 activation . This may relate to Rac1 signalling through PKCζ , as knockdown of PKCζ also inhibited CXCL12 - induced chemotaxis . Additionally Rac1 inhibition by NSC23766 was found to inhibit THP - 1 migration to CXCL11 but not CCL2 , suggesting NSC23766’s target could be CXCR7 , and / or its effect on CXCL12 / CXCR4 may be through modulating CXCR4 / CXCR7 dimerization . Cofilin phosphorylation in presence of CXCL12 was reduced by both NSC23766 and Rac1 - inhibiting peptide W56 , demonstrating that NSC23766 inhibits Rac1 signalling and also has off - target effects as a CXCR4 - biased antagonist . Chemotaxis and flow cytometry assays using CXCL14 with CXCL12 in Jurkat supported this conclusion . 258 10 : Future Work Chapter 3 : Future investigations could establish if CCL3 / CCR1 and CCL3 / CCR5 respond in similar ways to dynamin inhibitors , and if chemokine concentration influences responses to inhibitors . Chapter 4 : GSK3α / β are proteins with oncogenic ( through promoting β - catenin ) and tumour suppressing abilities [ 1021 ] . Small molecule GSK3 inhibitors are available e . g . StemMACSTM CHIR99021 . Establishing the role GSK3 plays in chemotaxis would facilitate further interpretation of the results above . Chapter 5 : Cofilin phosphorylation dynamics in adherent cell - lines such as MCF7 and PC3 could be investigated hence establish if chemokine - responses reported above in THP - 1 are general or cell - type specific . Chapter 6 : Like many transcription factors STAT3 can translocate to mitochondria where it may influence function of complexes in the electron transport chain to modulate ATP levels and energy dynamics [ 1022 ] . Mitochondrial STAT3 may also influence ROS production , cell growth and transformation [ 1023 ] all factors thought important in malignancy . MCF7 were transfected with mito - DS Red plasmids then treated with JAK2 / STAT3 inhibitors , figure 6 . 4 ; however transfection levels were not sufficient to analyse if there were any visual changes in mitochondria appearance / location from control in cells treated with JAK2 or STAT3 inhibitors . This would be interesting to establish . Chapter 7 : The next steps could include using Western Blot analysis of the effects of a range of NSAIDs along with Aspirin and Paracetamol on phosphorylation , i . e . activation or inhibition , of signalling proteins which purportedly are implicated in malignancies such as Akt , MEK , ERK and JAK . Chapter 8 : Next all papers which have used NSC23766 as a selective Rac1 inhibitor could be reviewed in the light of this and research by others [ 901 , 902 ] showing NSC23766 has off target effects . Also chemotaxis assays using NSC23766 with CXCR7 inhibitor CCX771 combinations could be done to see if they produce similar or additive effects . Then Flow cytometry and chemotaxis assays could be undertaken to see if AMD3100 competes with NSC23766 for CXCR4 or just has additive effect , if so this provides additional evidence that NSC23766 is binding CXCR7 , preventing CXCR4 / CXCR7 dimerization or hitting another cellular target to modulate CXCR4 expression . Finally treatment with pertussis toxin informs if signalling is Gαi linked , so further investigations could explore if NSC23766 effects are modulated by pertussis toxin . 259 11 : References 1 .
