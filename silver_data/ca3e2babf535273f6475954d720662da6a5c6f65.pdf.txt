Nachury 5 , Alexandre Benmerah 6 , 7 , Jean - Christophe Olivo - Marin 3 & Philippe Chavrier 1 , 2 In most eukaryotic cells microtubules undergo post - translational modifications such as acetylation of a - tubulin on lysine 40 , a wide - spreadmodificationrestrictedtoasubsetofmicrotubulesthatturnsoverslowly 1 . This subset of stable microtubules accumulates in cell protrusions 2 andregulatescellpolarization 3 , migrationandinvasion 4 – 7 . However , mechanisms restricting acetylation to these microtubules areunknown . Herewereportthatclathrin - coatedpits ( CCPs ) control microtubule acetylation through a direct interaction of the a - tubulin acetyltransferase a TAT1 ( refs 8 , 9 ) with the clathrin adaptor AP2 . We observe that about one - third of growing microtubule ends con - tact and pause at CCPs and that loss of CCPs decreases lysine 40 acetylation levels . We show that a TAT1 localizes to CCPs through a directinteractionwith AP2 that isrequired formicrotubuleacetyla - tion . Inmigratingcells , thepolarizedorientationofacetylatedmicro - tubules correlates with CCP accumulation at the leading edge 10 , and interactionof a TAT1withAP2isrequiredfordirectionalmigration . We conclude that microtubules contacting CCPs become acetylated by a TAT1 . Inmigratingcells , thismechanismensurestheacetylation of microtubules oriented towards the leading edge , thus promoting directional cell locomotion and chemotaxis . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is a fundamental process that regu - latesa widevarietyofcellfunctions includingsignalling , migrationand cell division . In migrating cells CCPs are asymmetrically distributed 10 and endocytic carriers are enriched at the leading edge , probably pro - viding a mechanism for rapid turnover of membrane components required for lamellipodia and adhesion site dynamics 11 , 12 . In addition , close contacts between CCPs and microtubules have been reported 13 , althoughthefunctionalconsequencesoftheseinteractionshaveremainedelusive . Here we set out to investigate the interaction between CCPs and the stable subset of microtubules that are oriented in the direction of protrusion . Using total internal reflection fluorescencemicroscopy ( TIRFM ) we observed that a large proportion of green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) – end binding protein 1 ( EB1 ) - labelled growing microtubule ( 1 ) ends disappeared upon contact with CCP labelled with monomeric red fluo - rescentprotein - taggedclathrinlightchain ( mRFP – LCa ) ( Fig . 1a ) . Auto - mated tracking and statistical co - localization analysis revealed that 31 % of disappearances occurred when an EB1 - positive comet contacted a CCPinHeLacells ( Fig . 1b ) , whereastheremainingcometsdisappeared inCCP - freeregions . This percentagewas significantlyhigherthan pre - dictiongivenbyrandomsuperpositionofdisappearingEB1 eventsand CCPs ( Fig . 1b and Methods ) . Approximately 28 % of growing GFP – a - tubulin - labelled microtubule ends that passed over a CCP paused at thisstructureinMDA - MB - 231cells ( Fig . 1c ) , similartothe27 % ofEB1 comets that stopped at CCPs in these cells ( Fig . 1b ) ; the pause time was highlyvariable with anaverageof16 . 8 6 15 . 1 s ( mean 6 s . e . m . ) .

Collectively , these data indicate that microtubules can pause and anchor transiently at CCPs . Anchoring events at the cell periphery have a role in the generation of stable microtubules 14 . We found that 17 6 0 . 7 % ( mean 6 s . e . m . ) of thevisibleacetylatedmicrotubuleextremitieswereincontactwithCCPsatthecellperiphery ( Fig . 1d ) . Notably , the amount of lysine 40 ( K40 ) - acetylated tubulin was markedly reduced when CCPs were disrupted , although there was no global change in microtubule network organi - zation or on levels of other microtubule modifications ( Fig . 1e – g and Extended Data Figs 2a and 3 ) . In addition , depletion of AP1 subunit c - adaptin did not affect K40 acetylation ( Fig . 1f , g and Extended Data Fig . 2b ) . Silencingofclathrinheavychain ( CHC ) , whichdidnotmodify AP2 localization at the plasma membrane ( ref . 15 and Extended Data Fig . 2 ) , did not affect K40 acetylation levels ( Fig . 1f , g and Extended DataFig . 2b ) , suggestingthattheroleofAP2inmicrotubuleacetylation isindependentofendocytosis . Thus , weconcludethatthereisapositive correlation between CCP density and K40 acetylation levels . In addi - tion , loss of dynamin function was reported to increase the density of CCPs at the plasma membrane and to enhance tubulin acetylation 16 , 17 . UsingTIRFM , weobservedthatGFP – a TAT1accumulatedintoCCPs ina microtubule - independentmanner andthat , 35 % of CCPs ( 302 of 853CCPsanalysedfrom7differentcells ) werepositiveforendogenous a TAT1 ( Fig . 2a and Extended Data Fig . 4b , c ) . GFP – a TAT1 was also found in focal adhesions and was associated with the microtubule net - work ( Extended Data Fig . 4a , d ) . In addition , co - immunoprecipitation assay with GFP – a TAT1 recovered tubulin as well as a - adaptin but not the AP1 subunit c - adaptin ( Fig . 2b ) . Notably , a TAT1 knockdown did not affect microtubule pausing at CCPs nor clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis ( Extended Data Fig . 5a , b ) . a TAT1comprisesacatalyticdomain ( residues1 – 193 ) andanunstruc - tured tail ( residues 193 – 421 ; Extended Data Fig . 6a ) 9 . We found that residues 307 – 387 contained the minimal binding sites for both AP2 and tubulin ( Fig . 2c ) . This region interacted directly with purified AP2 and tubulin ( Fig . 2d ) ; there was no competition between tubulin and AP2forbindingtoglutathione S - transferase ( GST ) – a TAT1 ( 307 – 387 ) , indicating that the two proteins have distinct binding sites ( Fig . 2d ) . Interestingly , GST – a TAT1 ( 307 – 387 ) did not interact with the recom - binant AP2 ‘core complex’ lacking the hinge and appendage domains of a - and b 2 - adaptin 18 ( Extended Data Fig . 6c ) . In addition , the AP2 - bindingregion of a TAT1 ( 307 – 387 ) pulleddown full - length a - adaptin and a truncatedvariant lacking the appendagedomain ( residues 1 – 690 ) , butnotaconstructmissingboththehingeandappendagedomains ( resi - dues 1 – 620 ; Fig . 2e and Extended Data Fig . 6b ) . Conversely , the hinge and appendage domains ( residues 603 – 938 ) were robustly pulled down by GST – a TAT1 ( 307 – 387 ) ( Fig . 2e ) . Together , these data support the conclusion that a TAT1 associates directly with the hinge domain of a - adaptin . Notably , a shorter a TAT1 isoformlacking the AP2 - binding domain ( Extended Data Fig . 7a ) 3 associated neither with microtubules norwithCCPs ( ExtendedDataFig . 7b , c ) , suggestingthatdifferent a TAT1 isoformsaredifferentiallylocalized . Consistentwithanessentialrolefor the interactionbetween a TAT1and AP2inK40 acetylation , expression of wild - type a - adaptin but not a - adaptin ( 1 – 620 ) restored K40 acetyla - tion in a - adaptin - depleted HeLa cells ( Fig . 2f , g ) . We next investigated whether CCPs are sites of microtubule acety - lation . When microtubules were depolymerized with nocodazole , K40 - acetylated tubulin was barely detected ( Extended Data Fig . 8a , b ; time 0 ) ; onlybrightdotscorrespondingtocentrosomesremainedvisible ( Fig . 3a ) . In agreement with previous findings 19 , short acetylated microtubule seg - ments were visible in the vicinity of the adherent plasma membrane 5minafternocodazole - washout - inducedmicrotubuleregrowth , whereas acetylated - K40 levels increased ( Fig . 3a and Extended Data Fig . 8a – d ) .

ThesedataareconsistentwiththeconclusionthatCCPsaresitesofmicro - tubule acetylation , although we do not exclude that other microtubule - acetylationsitesmayexist . Thelengthofacetylatedmicrotubulesegments increased progressively with time , concomitant with acetylated K40 levels also reaching a plateau , whereas K40 acetylation was strongly delayed and reduced in a - adaptin - depleted cells ( Fig . 3a and Extended DataFig . 8a , b ) . BecauseGolgi - associatedmicrotubulesarerapidlyacety - lated under nocodazole - washout conditions 20 , the subset of microtubule being acetylated at CCPs 5 min after nocodazole washout could arise from Golgi - mediated nucleation 21 . Stable microtubules oriented towards the leading edge have a role in migrating cells 22 , 23 . We observed that in MDA - MB - 231 cells migrating onatwo - dimensionalsubstrateorthroughathree - dimensionalmatrix oftypeI collagenfibres , acetylatedmicrotubuleswereorientedtowards the cell front where CCPs accumulated 10 ( Fig . 3c and Extended Data Fig . 9a , b ) . Moreover , acetylated - K40 levels were reduced in AP2 - or a TAT1 - depletedcellswithinthethree - dimensionalenvironment ( Exten - ded Data Fig . 9c ) . This suggested that a TAT1 associated with CCPs at the cell front controls the polarized distribution of acetylated micro - tubules . On a two - dimensional substrate , MDA - MB - 231 cells depleted for a - adaptin or a TAT1 moved with a similar velocity to control cells but in less linear paths , indicating that both proteins regulate the direc - tionality of cellmigration ( Extended Data Fig . 10a , b ) . By contrast , CHC depletion reduced velocity but did not affect directionality ( Extended DataFig . 10a , b ) , possiblyreflectingtheAP2 - independentroleofclathrin in focal adhesion turnover , a process that is required for migration 24 . Inactivation of AP2 or a TAT1 also inhibited the invasive migration of MDA - MB - 231 cellsina three - dimensionalenvironmentaspotentlyas knockdown of the pro - invasive metalloproteinase MT1 - MMP ( Fig . 4a and Extended Data Fig . 10c ) 6 , 25 . Migration of cancer cells away from the primary tumouris generally orientedtowards growthfactorsin the microenvironment 26 . Wegeneratedagradientofepidermalgrowthfactor ( EGF ) in the three - dimensional collagen gel ( Fig . 4b – d ) and observed that although the intensity of the gradient progressively diminished overtime ( Fig . 4e ) , thesloperemainedapproximatelyconstant ( Fig . 4f ) and cells effectively moved towards the gradient ( Fig . 4g , h ) . Silencing of AP2 or a TAT1 , but not of CHC , inhibited cell movement towards the EGF gradient ( Fig . 4g – h ) as well as the directionality ( persistence ) EGF gradient ( si ) NT ( si ) α - adaptin ( si ) α TAT1 ( si ) CHC ( s i ) N T ( s i ) α - a d a p t i n ( s i ) α T A T 1 ( s i ) C H C ( s i ) N T ( s i ) α - a d a p t i n ( s i ) α T A T 1 ( s i ) C H C A x i a l d i s p l ace m e n t t o w a r d t h e g r a d i e n t ( mm ) 80 60 40 20 0 – 20 0 . 5 0 . 4 0 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 1 0 P e r s i s t e n ce o f m i g r a t i o n g h i 1 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 P e r s i s t e n ce o f m i g r a t i o n * * ( si ) NT + GFP + GFP + WT + 1 – 620 ( si ) α - adaptin * * * * j 3D collagen / EGF 3D collagen / EGF 2D 1 2 1 2 Distance ( μ m ) 0 650 A488 – EGF fluorescence Setup top view Setup side view ~ 5 mm ~ 15 mm b c a T0 T2 ( si ) NT ( si ) MT1 ( si ) α TAT1 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 N o r m a li z e d a r ea ( % ) * * T0 T2 T0 T2 T0 T2 T0 T2 ( si ) α - adaptin ( si ) μ 2 - adaptin * * 3D collagen / multicellular spheroids 0 3 , 500 3 , 000 2 , 500 2 , 000 1 , 500 A 488 – E G F fl u o r e s ce n ce i n t e n s i t y ( a . u . ) Distance ( μ m ) 0 h 10 h 20 h 30 h 40 h 50 h 60 h 70 h d 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 A 488 – E G F fl u o r e s ce n ce i n t e n s i t y ( % o f m a x . ) Distance ( μ m ) e 1 2 f 200 400 600 0 h 10 h 20 h 30 h 40 h 50 h 60 h 70 h 0 200 400 600 Figure 4 | a TAT1 interaction with AP2 is required for directed cell migration . a , Area of three - dimensional ( 3D ) invasion after 2days ( T2 ) by spheroids of siRNAs - treated MDA - MB - 231 cells . b , c , Schematic representation ( b ) or phase - contrast image ( c ) of the three - dimensional collagen I EGF - chemotaxis setup .

Finally , consistent with an essential role for the interaction between a TAT1andAP2 , expressionofwild - type a - adaptin butnot a - adaptin ( 1 – 620 ) restoredthedirectionalityoftwo - dimensional migration in a - adaptin - depleted cells ( Fig . 4j ) . In conclusion , we report an unanticipated role for CCPs in micro - tubuleacetylationthroughadirectinteractionbetween a TAT1andAP2 . We propose that the asymmetric distribution of CCPs shapes the acety - lated microtubule network by selectively acetylating microtubules that are oriented towards the leading edge , thus promoting directed cell motility and chemotaxis . METHODS SUMMARY Forlive - cellTIRFMandspinningdiskmicroscopy , cellswereimagedfor100msat 1 - s intervals for 120s . Automatic detection and tracking of fluorescent EB1 and LCa spots was performed using the ICY software 27 . For siRNA depletion , HeLa cellsorMDA - MB - 231cellsweretransfectedwithindicatedsiRNAsbyusingOligo - fectamine ( Invitrogen ) or Lullaby ( OZ Biosciences ) , respectively . DNAconstructs encoding GFP - tagged full - length a TAT1 ( residues 1 – 421 ) or GST - tagged a TAT1 variants ( residues 1 – 193 , 1 – 307 , 307 – 421 , 307 – 387 or 347 – 421 ) were obtained by PCR by using murine a TAT1 complementaryDNAas a template andsubcloning into pEGFP - C3 ( Clontech ) or into pGEX4T1 ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) , respectively . GST constructs were expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli and purified by using glutathione - Sepharose beads ( GE Healthcare ) . Pulldown experiments were performed by incubating GST – a TAT1 domains with HeLa cell lysate pre - paredin50mMTris , pH7 . 4 , 137mMNaCl , 1mMMgCl 2 , 10 % glycerol , 1 % Triton X - 100 with protease inhibitors . Immunoprecipitation assays were performed by incubating lysates of HeLa cells expressing GFP or GFP – a TAT1 with GFP – Trap - coupled agarose beads ( ChromoTek ) . To analyse microtubule regrowth and K40 acetylation , HeLa cells were first incubated with 10 m M nocodazole for 5h before washingoutthedrug withfreshmedium . The three - dimensionalcollagenchemo - taxis setup was built by polymerizing a 50 - m l collagen - I ( acid extracted ) droplet containingEGFfollowedbypolymerizationofa200 - m lEGF - freecollagen - Idroplet containing 10 , 000 cells per ml atop the inner gel . Migration of MDA - MB - 231 cells was analysed by manual tracking using MetaMorph software .

A motorized device driven by MetaMorph allowed the accurate positioning of the illumination light for evanescent wave excitation . For spinning disk microscopy , HeLa or MDA - MB - 231 cells plated onto glass - bottom dishes and transfected with the indicated constructs were imaged for exposure times of 100ms at 1 - s intervals for 120s using a spinning disk micro - scope ( RoperScientific ) basedonaCSU22Yokogawaheadmountedonthelateral port of an inverted TE - 2000U Nikon microscope equipped with a 100 3 1 . 4 NA Plan - Apo objective lens and a dual - output laser launch , which included 491 - and 561 - nm50 - mWDPSSlasers ( RoperScientific ) . ImageswereacquiredwithaCoolSNAP HQ2 charge - coupled device ( CCD ) camera ( Roper Scientific ) . The system was steered by MetaMorph 7 software . Automatic EB1 and LCa spot detection and tracking . HeLa cells or MDA - MB - 231 cells transfected with mRFP – LCa and GFP – EB1 were imaged the next day by TIRFMforexposuretimesof100msat1 - sintervalsfor120s . Automaticdetection of EB1 and LCa fluorescent spots and automatic tracking of EB1 comets was performed using the ICY software ( http : / / icy . bioimageanalysis . org ; ref . 28 ) . In brief , detectionofEB1andLCaspotswasbasedonwavelettransformandautoma - tic tracking of EB1 comets was then performed by a Bayesian Kalman filtering approach using a linear kinetic model . Once the tracks were computed , the last spotsofeachtrackwereextractedtocomputethedistanceco - localizationframeby frame with the coordinates of LCa spot centroid . The co - localization distance was defined as a positive hit when the pixel distance between EB1 and LCa centroids waslessthanorequaltothreepixels . Thepercentageoflast - detectedEB1centroids that co - localized with LCa spots was calculated for each frame and the average valueforthe120frameswasthencalculated . Thesameanalysiswasalsoperformed after shifting the positions of CCPs of five pixels in order to exclude a possible random superposition of last EB1 spots and CCPs . For each cell , this control analysis was performed four times by shifting CCP positions in the four different orthogonaldirectionsandthevaluesobtainedwereaveragedtogivethepercentageofrandomcoincidencebetweenlastEB1spotsandCCPcoordinates .

Persistent migration indexwascalculatedbydividingtheEuclideandistancebytheaccumulateddistance . Three - dimensional collagen I multicellular spheroid invasion assay . Multi - cellular spheroids of MDA - MB - 231 cells were prepared by the hanging droplet method 32 using 3 3 10 3 cells in 20 - m l droplets of complete L15 medium . For siRNA treatment , cells were first transfected by nucleofection ( Kit V , Lonza ) with 100nM SMARTpool siRNAs specific for a TAT1 or MT1 - MMP and transfected again the next day with 25nM of the same siRNA using Lullaby reagent ( OZ Bio - science ) ; spheroids were prepared 24h later . After 3days , spheroids were embed - dedin type I collagen ( preparedfrom acidextractsof rattail tendon ata finalcon - centration of 2 . 2mgml 2 1 ( ref . 33 ) .

Quan - tificationofinvasionwasperformedbymeasuringthediameterofspheroidsatT0andT2asdescribed 6 . These values were averaged and used to calculate the mean invasion area ( p r 2 ) . Mean invasion area at T2 was normalized to mean invasion area at T0 . Depletion of the metalloproteinase MT1 - MMP ( siMT1 ) , which is required for efficient migration through a three - dimensional collagen matrix 6 , was used as a control .

During this polymerization phase , EGF binds onto collagen fibres ( our observation , not shown ) . After three washes with PBS to remove excess EGF , a second droplet ( 200 m l , outer gel ) of type I collagenatafinalconcentrationof2 . 2mgml 2 1 andseededwith10 , 000MDA - MB - 231 cells ml 2 1 was polymerized around the inner droplet for 1h at room temper - aturebeforetoimmergethesetupinpre - warmedL15mediumcontaining2 % FCS . Cells in the outer gel were then imaged every 20min for 72h by phase - contrast videomicroscopyusinga10 3 dryobjective atthe interface betweenthe innerand outer gels in order to keep track of the gradient parameters ( slope and relative intensity ) through recordingofA488 – EGFfluorescence intensity . Asdescribedin Fig . 4 , the intensity of the gradient was not constant and actually decreased over time but its slope remained approximately the same . This is important as it was described previously that cells are primarily sensitive to the steepness of the gra - dientandtoalesserextenttoitsintensity 34 . Manualtrackingofindividualcellswas performed using Metamorph software and allowed to calculate the displacement of each cell along the axis of the gradient as well as the persistent migration index ( Euclideandistance / accumulateddistance ) .
