Clathrin - coated pits invaginate from speciﬁc membrane com - partments and pinch off as coated vesicles . These vesicles then uncoat rapidly once released . The Hsc70 molecular chaperone effects the uncoating reaction , and is guided to appropriate locations on clathrin lattices by the J - domain - containing co - chaperone molecule auxilin 1 – 4 . This raises the question of how a local event such as ATP hydrolysis by Hsc70 can catalyse a global disassembly . Here , we have used electron cryomicroscopy to determine 12 - A˚ - resolution structures of in - vitro - assembled clathrin coats in association with a carboxy - terminal fragment of auxilin that contains both the clathrin - binding region and the J domain . We have located the auxilin fragment by computing differences between these structures and those lacking auxilin ( described in an accompanying paper 5 ) . Auxilin binds within the clathrin lattice near contacts between an inward - projecting C - terminal helical tripod and the crossing of two ‘ankle’ seg - ments ; it also contacts the terminal domain of yet another clathrin ‘leg’ . It therefore recruits Hsc70 to the neighbourhood of a set of critical interactions . Auxilin binding produces a local letters to nature NATURE | VOL 432 | 2 DECEMBER 2004 | www . nature . com / nature 649 © 200 4 Nature PublishingGroup change in heavy - chain contacts , creating a detectable global distortion of the clathrin coat . We propose a mechanism by which local destabilization of the lattice promotes general uncoating . The clathrin - uncoating activity of Hsc70 was originally identiﬁed by biochemical assays in vitro 1 – 3 , but convincing demonstration of its in vivo function required the characterization of auxilin as its speciﬁc co - chaperone 4 . Inactivation of yeast auxilin ( Swa2 ) leads to anomalous accumulation of coated vesicles 6 , and RNA interference with nematode auxilin causes similar defects 7 . Mammalian gen - omes encode two auxilins : auxilin 1 is brain speciﬁc 4 , whereas auxilin 2 is general 8 . Auxilin 1 is a 910 - residue protein with an amino - terminal PTEN - like domain , a central clathrin - binding domain , and a C - terminal Hsc70 - binding J domain 4 . Auxilin 2 contains an additional N - terminal kinase domain 9 . Binding to clathrin coats , Hsc70 recruitment and in vitro uncoating require only residues 547 – 910 , which comprise the clathrin - binding and J domains 8 , 10 . The clathrin - binding region of auxilin appears to be largely unstructured in solution 10 , but about 25 residues at its C - terminal end contribute two additional helices to the usual three helices of the globular J domain , as revealed by a crystal structure 11 of a fragment comprising residues 810 – 910 and a solution struc - ture 12 of a slightly larger fragment ( residues 776 – 910 ) . A recent image reconstruction of clathrin coats assembled with full - length auxilin instead of AP - 2 adaptor proteins has shown that auxilin forms a shell of density within the coat 13 , but the resolution of the map does not allow speciﬁc visualization of clathrin – auxilin contacts . We expressed and puriﬁed the 39 - kDa C - terminal fragment of auxilin 1 ( residues 547 – 910 ) comprising the clathrin - binding and J domains . Published studies show that this fragment can direct uncoating by interaction with Hsc70 ( ref . 14 ) . We used pre - assembled clathrin coats ( containing three - legged clathrin heavy and light chain triskelions ) and AP - 2 complexes assembled as described in the accompanying paper 5 , and obtained site - speciﬁc binding of the auxilin fragment by adding increasing amounts of auxilin to coats ( Fig . 1 ) . Saturation corresponded to three auxilin molecules bound per clathrin triskelion , in agreement with previous reports 14 , 15 . To prepare electron cryomicroscopy samples , we mixed assembled coats with auxilin ( 547 – 910 ) at a molar ratio ( clathrin to auxilin ) of 1 : 20 and incubated the mixture for 30 min . To preserve saturation of auxilin - binding sites , we did not remove unbound auxilin ( 547 – 910 ) and carried out the electron microscopy in the presence of an auxilin background . We selected images of hexagonal barrel coats and computed a three - dimensional reconstruction ( Fig . 2 ) at 12 A˚ resolution as described in Methods . The map details of auxilin - bound coats resemble closely those of auxilin - free coats 5 , but the dimensions of the auxilin - bound D6 barrels ( roughly 670 £ 700 A˚ ) are more isometric than those of the unmodiﬁed barrels ( 655 £ 700 A˚ ) . Inaccuracy in the determination of electron - microscopic magniﬁcation cannot account for the observed effect , as it would produce isotropic differences rather than a difference in axial ratio . The change in shape of the barrel prevented us from computing a difference map directly . We there - fore ﬁtted clathrin leg segments into the map , obtained nine averaging transformations as in the accompanying paper 5 , and identiﬁed density in the averaged map not accounted for by the clathrin model ( Fig . 3 ) . In the accompanying paper we describe by the “invariant hub assembly” the tripod and three proximal seg - ments radiating from a vertex , the distal segments ( belonging to triskelions centred at nearest - neighbour vertices ) , and the triangle of ankles ( belonging to triskelions centred at second - nearest - neighbour vertices ) at the foot of the tripod . Although the proximal , distal and helical tripod parts of the hub assembly superpose well , the orientation of the ankle segment is shifted in the auxilin - bound form , becoming more parallel to the proximal and distal segments and moving the terminal domain radially outward . These local changes must produce the global distortion in axial ratio . There may also be other , more subtle adjustments in clathrin contacts that we are unable to detect at the current level of precision . Auxilin ( 547 – 910 ) lies close to the site at which the ankle segments cross ( Fig . 4 ) , as might be expected from the change in ankle orientation that its binding generates . Density that we ascribe to a Figure 1 Binding of auxilin ( 547 – 910 ) to clathrin coats .

The putative molecular contacts are consistent with in vitro pull - down experiments , show - ing that auxilin has multiple interactions with different segments of clathrin , including fragments that encompass the terminal domain and the ankle 10 . The structure of the C - terminal 110 residues of bovine auxilin 12 was inserted by inspection into the difference density ( Fig . 4 ) . The fragment contains ﬁve a - helices , the last three of which are the canonical helices I – III of a J domain . The model of the ﬁve helices ( residues 800 – 910 ) occupies about one - third of the volume that we attribute to the 39 - kDa auxilin fragment . It does not seem to participate in any direct interaction with clathrin , in agreement with reported biochemical data showing that the J domain alone does not bind heavy chain 4 . The parts of the J domain believed to associate with Hsc70—the HPD triplet , helix II and the loop connecting helices I and II ( ref . 11 ) —are all exposed on the outward - facing domain surface ( Fig . 4c ) . The structure therefore shows that auxilin will direct Hsc70 to a position beneath the triskelion vertex , adjacent to the clathrin contact that we have proposed determines coat stability 5 . The remaining domain ( s ) at the N terminus of auxilin , absent from our structure , would probably project inward towards the membrane . If the PTEN - like domain is indeed an active lipid phosphatase , then association of auxilin with a clathrin lattice will place it adjacent to potential substrates . Proteins in the Hsp70 family , such as Escherichia coli DnaK , bind to and release short , exposed hydrophobic segments of polypeptide chain . ATP hydrolysis drives the cycle . The Hsp70 ATPase domain resembles actin ; the substrate - binding domain is a molecular clamp with a peptide - binding groove . The coupling of the two domains has yet to be visualized directly . A J - domain - containing protein recruits ATP - bound Hsp70 to the substrate ( for example , an unfolded protein in the best - characterized examples ) ; ATP hydro - lysis and dissociation of the J protein leave the Hsp70 molecule clamped to an exposed hydrophobic segment ; and binding of a new ATP opens the clamp and restarts the cycle . How can such a simple molecular device couple ATP hydrolysis to disassembly ? The struc - tures described here and in the accompanying paper 5 lead to the following suggestions . Clathrin light chains are not required for uncoating 4 . The best candidate for an unfolded , hydrophobic segment to which Hsc70 can attach is therefore the C terminus ( residues 1631 – 1675 ) of the heavy chain , which projects into the corners of the triangular structure formed by three crossed ankle regions ( Fig . 3a ) . This is the only part of the heavy chain that does not have a highly organized secondary and tertiary structure 5 . It contains the sequence QLMLT , which shares a noticeable resemblance to the lastﬁveresiduesof theFYQLALTpeptide thatbinds Hsc70withhigh afﬁnity and efﬁciently stimulates its ATPase activity 16 . Moreover , the ankle crossing contacted by this part of the heavy chain is precisely the contact that is perturbed by auxilin binding . Depending on its relative orientation with respect to the ATPase domain , the Hsc70 clamp module could easily reach an exposed C - terminal peptide . The location of auxilin ( 547 – 910 ) and the changes in contacts among nearby clathrin leg segments thus suggest a mechanism by which auxilin could create local strain , release the neighbouring C - terminal segment from its interaction with an ankle , and recruit Hsc70 to clamp and sequester the segment thus exposed . The change in overall geometryof the clathrin lattice generated by auxilin ( 547 – 910 ) binding also suggests a way in which a pertur - bation at one vertex could generate distortions at others . A large number of auxilin – Hsc70 – C - terminal peptide interactions may not be required to destabilize a coat . If disassembly occurs in the absence of a pool of soluble clathrin that could replace dislocated trimers , Figure 3 Changes in clathrin heavy - chain contacts produced by auxilin binding . a , Comparison of the arrangement of clathrin legs in the region around a vertex of the D6 barrel ( the “hub assembly” , as deﬁned in the accompanying paper 5 ) .

A Methods Specimen preparation Clathrin coats were assembled from puriﬁed clathrin triskelions and AP - 2 complex proteins as described in the accompanying paper 5 . DNA encoding full - length bovine auxilin in a pQE - 30 vector 17 was provided by E . Ungewickell . The sequence encoding the clathrin - binding region and J domain ( amino acid residues 547 – 910 ) was ampliﬁed from the full - length auxilin DNA by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) with Pfu DNA polymerase ( Stratagene ) using5 0 - GACGTGAGATCTCCGAGTGGACCTACATCC - 3 0 and 5 0 - CCTCCGCTCGAGTTAATACAAGGGCTTTTGGCCTTG - 3 0 as the forward and reverse primers . The PCR product was digested with Bgl II / Xho I and subcloned into a Bam HI / Xho I - digested glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - containing pGEX4T - 1 vector ( Pharmacia ) . The integrity of the subcloned auxilin DNA fragment was veriﬁed by sequencing . TheGST – auxilin ( 547 – 910 ) fusionproteinwasexpressedin E . coli strainBL21 . Bacteria were grown at 37 8 C to an optical density at 600nm of 0 . 6 and then induced with 1mM IPTG at 25 8 C for 3h . The cells were spun down , re - suspended in 50ml of PBS , pH7 . 4 , supplemented with one Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tablet ( Roche Applied Science ) , and lysed by sonication . Cell debris was separated by centrifugation and GST – auxilin ( 547 – 910 ) puriﬁed from the supernatant by afﬁnity chromatography on glutathione Sepharose ( Pharmacia ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The GSTtag wasremovedbycleaving 1mgoftheSepharose - boundfusionproteinwith1Uof thrombin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) at4 8 Cfor10h . Thecleavagereactionwasstoppedbyaddition of PMSF ( 1mM ﬁnal ) . GST - free auxilin ( 547 – 910 ) was further puriﬁed by gel ﬁltration chromatography using a Superose 12 column ( Amersham Biosciences ) equilibrated with 20mM HEPES , pH7 . 0 , 2mM MgCl 2 , 25mM KCl , 10mM ( NH4 ) 2 SO 4 . Puriﬁed auxilin ( 547 – 910 ) was stored in a frozen state at 2 80 8 C . Electron cryomicroscopy To prepare samples for electron microscopy , assembled coats were mixed with auxilin ( 547 – 910 ) in reaction buffer at a molar ratio of 1 : 20 and incubated on ice for 30min . To preserve saturation of all auxilin - binding sites , unbound auxilin was not removed . Freezing procedures and electron cryomicroscopy data collection were performed exactly as described in the accompanying paper 5 . We recorded about 300 electron micrographs , which included the data collected from twosamplebatchespreparedon differentdates . Image processingwasperformedonly for hexagonal barrel particles . About 6 , 500 particles were picked from the selected 190 high - qualitymicrographsandassembledintothestack . Wedidnotgothroughtheinitialstages of particle image classiﬁcation and class - average - based three - dimensional reconstruction for auxilin - bound particles . Instead , the three - dimensional model of auxilin - free hexagonal barrels ( see the accompanying paper 5 ) was used as a reference for direct parameter search and reﬁnement in FREALIGN 18 . We ﬁrst performed FREALIGN reﬁnement in the 800 – 40A˚ resolution range to select the best particles . Images of auxilin - bound clathrin coats had relatively noisier backgrounds when compared with those of auxilin - free complexes mainly due to the presence of unbound auxilin . We therefore used a slightly less stringent criterion for particle selection and included about 900 clathrin coat particles with a PRES value lower than 65 8 ( rather than 62 8 , as used for auxilin - free samples ) in the ﬁnal reﬁnement procedure . Further reﬁnement of the selected particles produced a 12A˚ reconstruction of auxilin - bound clathrin coats as shown in Fig . 2 .

In this Letter , we used strain MT2124 , the standard let - 60 ( n1046gf ) strain maintained in the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center , for odour - chemotaxis assays . However , we have found that this strain carries a side mutation ( s ) that profoundly impairs chemotaxis to the odorant isoamyl alcohol , indicating that we need to re - evaluate our conclusion from the results shown in Fig . 1 that the let - 60 ( n1046gf ) mutant has a reduced efﬁciency of odorant chemo - taxis . We outcrossed MT2124 to the wild - type N2 and obtained two let - 60 ( n1046gf ) strains , JN130 and JN131 . We also outcrossed the MT4866 strain , the let - 60 ( n2021lf ) strain used in the study , and obtained the JN148 strain . All the outcrossed strains show reduced chemotaxis to the two odorants tested , isoamyl alcohol and diacetyl , at low odorant concentrations ( T . H . and Y . I . , unpublished results ) . The chemotaxis defects are comparable in extent to , or slightly weaker than , the original MT4866 let - 60 ( n2021lf ) strain . Our conclusion that both inactivation and hyperactivation of LET - 60 Ras cause reduced chemotaxis therefore remains unchanged . How - ever , the result shown in Fig . 1d , which suggested that ksr - 1 ( lf ) , mek - 2 ( lf ) and mpk - 1 ( lf ) suppress let - 60 ( n1046gf ) , is no longer valid because outcrossed let - 60 ( n1046gf ) strains do not show chemotaxis defects at the odorant concentration used in Fig . 1d ( 1 £ 10 2 3 dilution of isoamyl alcohol ) .
