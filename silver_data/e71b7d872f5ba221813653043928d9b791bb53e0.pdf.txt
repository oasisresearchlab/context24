Ingram , Peter H . Rosal , and Todd R . Graham Department of Molecular Biology , Vanderbilt University , Nashville , Tennessee 37235 Abstract . ADP - ribosylation factor appears to regulate the budding of both COPI and clathrin - coated trans - port vesicles from Golgi membranes . An arf1 (cid:68) syn - thetic lethal screen identiﬁed SWA3 / DRS2 , which encodes an integral membrane P - type ATPase and po - tential aminophospholipid translocase ( or ﬂippase ) . The drs2 null allele is also synthetically lethal with clathrin heavy chain ( chc1 ) temperature - sensitive alle - les , but not with mutations in COPI subunits or other SEC genes tested . Consistent with these genetic analy - ses , we found that the drs2 (cid:68) mutant exhibits late Golgi defects that may result from a loss of clathrin function at this compartment . These include a defect in the Kex2 - dependent processing of pro – (cid:97) - factor and the ac - cumulation of abnormal Golgi cisternae . Moreover , we observed a marked reduction in clathrin - coated vesicles that can be isolated from the drs2 (cid:68) cells . Subcellular fractionation and immunoﬂuorescence analysis indicate that Drs2p localizes to late Golgi membranes contain - ing Kex2p . These observations indicate a novel role for a P - type ATPase in late Golgi function and suggest a possible link between membrane asymmetry and clath - rin function at the Golgi complex . Key words : adenosine diphosphate – ribosylation fac - tor • aminophospholipid translocase • clathrin • DRS2 • trans - Golgi network T HE directed movement of proteins between com - partments of the secretory and endocytic pathways is driven by the formation of small coated transport vesicles that bud from a donor compartment , and then fuse with an acceptor compartment . COPI , COPII , and clathrin are the best characterized coat proteins involved in protein transport . COPI , a heptameric ( (cid:97) , (cid:98) , (cid:98)(cid:57) , (cid:103) , (cid:100) , (cid:101) , (cid:122) - COP ) protein complex , coats vesicles that mediate pro - tein transport from the Golgi to the ER and possibly between Golgi compartments . To initiate budding of COPI - coated vesicles from Golgi membranes , the small GTP - binding protein ADP - ribosylation factor ( ARF ) 1 mediates the recruitment of COPI coats to primarily cis Golgi cis - ternae . ARF is also required to recruit clathrin / AP - 1 coats to the trans - Golgi network . Clathrin coats are assembled from triskelions composed of three clathrin heavy chains and three light chains . The tetrameric adaptor protein ( AP ) complex , AP - 1 , links membrane proteins to clathrin at the TGN and appears to facilitate cargo delivery to en - dosomal compartments ( reviewed in Schmid , 1997 ) . Inter - estingly , the molecular basis for the ARF - dependent re - cruitment of COPI and clathrin / AP - 1 to two different regions of the Golgi complex is not known . Clathrin / AP - 2 vesicles mediate the internalization of proteins from the plasma membrane , although recruitment of this coat does not appear to require ARF . In addition , the recruitment of COPII to ER membranes is mediated by the small GTP - binding protein Sar1p rather than ARF . In yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , ARF is encoded by two nearly identical genes , ARF1 and ARF2 , that appear to be functionally redundant . Deletion of both ARF genes is lethal , but strains harboring either an arf1 (cid:68) or an arf2 (cid:68) allele are viable and grow nearly as well as an isogenic wild - type strain ( Stearns et al . , 1990a ) . However , deletion of the more highly expressed ARF1 gene causes a defect in the kinetics of protein transport through the secretory pathway , a reduction in Golgi - dependent glycosylation of secreted glycoproteins , and substantial changes in the morphology of Golgi cisternae and endosomes ( Gaynor et al . , 1998 ; Stearns et al . , 1990b ) . To gain a better understanding of the essential role that ARF plays in vivo , we have used a genetic screen to iden - tify seven genes ( SWA1 – SWA7 ) for which mutant alleles Drs . Chen and Ingram contributed equally to this work and should be considered co – first authors . Address correspondence to Todd R .

This genetic interac - tion often predicts that the two gene products function in the same pathway or in parallel pathways . swa5 - 1 was pre - viously identified as a new temperature - sensitive ( ts ) allele of the clathrin heavy chain gene ( chc1 - 5 ) , providing sup - port for a functional interaction in vivo between clathrin and ARF ( Chen and Graham , 1998 ) . Deletion of the CHC1 gene can be lethal or viable depending on the strain background . Mutants harboring chc1 (cid:68) , if viable , exhibit slow growth , decreased rates of endocytosis , and a defect in retention of late Golgi membrane proteins ( Payne et al . , 1987 , 1988 ; Payne and Schekman , 1989 ; Lemmon et al . , 1990 ) . Disruption of the clathrin light chain gene ( CLC1 ) causes a reduced stability of Chc1p and results in pheno - types similar to that of chc1 mutants ( Chu et al . , 1996 ) . Al - though mutations in AP - 1 subunits ( Aps1p , Apm1p , and Apl2p ) do not result in any detectable phenotypes , a pair - wise combination of aps1 (cid:68) , apm1 (cid:68) , or apl2 (cid:68) with chc1 - ts exacerbates defects in growth and retention of Golgi resi - dent proteins relative to the chc1 - ts mutant ( Phan et al . , 1994 ; Rad et al . , 1995 ; Stepp et al . , 1995 ) . Here we report that SWA3 is allelic to DRS2 , which en - codes an integral membrane P - type ATPase ( Ripmaster et al . , 1993 ) that is 47 % identical to the mammalian ATP - ase II purified from chromaffin granules ( Tang et al . , 1996 ) . ATPase II is thought to be an aminophospholipid translocase ( Auland et al . , 1994 ; Zachowski et al . , 1989 ) , capable of flipping phosphatidylserine ( PS ) or phosphati - dylethanolamine ( PE ) from the external leaflet of a lipid bilayer to the cytoplasmic leaflet to generate an asymmet - ric distribution of these lipids in the two leaflets of a mem - brane . In mammalian cells , most of the plasma membrane PS is restricted to the cytoplasmic leaflet by the action of a similar aminophospholipid translocase , but a calcium in - flux induces the loss of plasma membrane lipid asymmetry and results in the exposure of PS on the cell surface . This event allows recognition and removal of apoptotic cells by phagocytes , and in blood cells activates the coagulation cascade ( Williamson and Schlegel , 1994 ) . Mammalian ATP - ase II is found in chromaffin granules ( Zachowski et al . , 1989 ) , synaptic vesicles ( Hicks and Parsons , 1992 ) , and clathrin - coated vesicles ( Xie et al . , 1989 ) , although the function of ATPase II in these vesicles is not known . While there is no evidence that Drs2p generates phospho - lipid asymmetry in the yeast plasma membrane , the drs2 (cid:68) mutant has been reported to exhibit a defect in transloca - tion of a fluorescent PS derivative across the plasma mem - brane ( Tang et al . , 1996 ) . However , this result has been disputed ( Siegmund et al . , 1998 ) , calling into question whether Drs2p functions as an aminophospholipid translo - case at the plasma membrane . In addition to the synthetic lethal interaction with arf1 (cid:68) , we found that drs2 (cid:68) also exhibits a specific synthetic lethal interaction with chc1 - ts alleles . Moreover , the drs2 (cid:68) mu - tant has a defect in late Golgi function and exhibits several phenotypes at the nonpermissive temperature that suggest a loss of clathrin function at the yeast Golgi in vivo . Con - sistent with these observations , immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation studies indicate that Drs2p local - izes to late Golgi membranes . These results argue that the primary site of Drs2p function is in the Golgi complex rather than the plasma membrane , and suggest a link be - tween Drs2p and the ARF - dependent recruitment of clathrin to Golgi membranes .

Cloning of SWA3 and Plasmid Construction To clone SWA3 , strain CCY2808 ( swa3 - 2 ; Chen and Graham , 1998 ) was transformed with a genomic library ( Horazdovsky et al . , 1994 ) and Leu (cid:49) transformants were selected on synthetic dextrose - Leu media containing 4 (cid:109) g / ml adenine . After 7 – 10 d of incubation at 30 (cid:56) C , 50 colonies that ap - peared to sector ( out of 21 , 000 transformants ) were streaked on 5 (cid:57) - fluoro - orotic acid ( FOA ) plates . Library plasmids were rescued from the four strains that grew on FOA and were retransformed into CCY2808 . Only the transformants harboring pPR10 were able to sector on YPD at 30 (cid:56) C and were able to grow at 20 (cid:56) C . Partial sequencing indicated that the other three plasmids contained ARF2 . pPR10 contained a fragment of chromosome I from coordinates 94916 – 104338 . Deletion of the BamHI fragment contained solely in DRS2 ( to produce pPR10 (cid:68) BamHI ) destroyed the complementing activity of pPR10 . The full - length DRS2 gene contained on a SpeI - SnaBI fragment was subcloned into SpeI - SnaBI digested pRS315 or pRS425 to produce pRS315 - DRS2 and pRS425 - DRS2 . Both plasmids complemented the cold - sensitive growth defect of CCY2808 . A drs2 deletion plasmid ( pGCR1 ) was constructed by replacing a BamHI - SnaBI fragment in pPR10 with an (cid:122) 1 . 1 - kb BamHI - PvuII fragment containing TRP1 from pJJ280 ( Jones and Prakash , 1990 ) . The plasmid pGCR1 was linearized with SacI and HpaI and transformed into SEY6210 to produce 6210 drs2 (cid:68) . The correct integration event was confirmed by PCR . Site - directed mutagenesis of DRS2 was performed by the megaprimer PCR method ( Barik and Galinski , 1991 ) . To generate megaprimers coding for either a D to N or D to E mutation at amino acid position 560 , reverse primers TCCTGTCTTGTTACTGAATATAT and TCCTGTC - TTTTCACTGAATATAT , respectively , were combined with forward primer TTTGTCACCGTTGAATTAATC into a PCR reaction mixture containing pRS315 - DRS2 . The gel purified (cid:122) 150 - bp product was added to a second PCR reaction containing the reverse primer TTCATCATC - CAATCTTTCCAG and pRS315 - DRS2 . The resulting (cid:122) 650 - bp products were digested with BspEI and BglII , and then ligated into BspEI / BglII cut pRS315 - DRS2 to produce pDRS2 ( D560N ) and pDRS2 ( D560E ) . Se - quencing of the resulting plasmids indicated that the specific mutations had been introduced with no additional mutations . The 2 - (cid:109) m KEX2HA plasmid was constructed by subcloning a SalI / EagI digestion fragment of pSN218 ( Nothwehr et al . , 1995 ) , containing the KEX2 - HA sequence , into SalI / EagI - digested pRS426 to produce p426KH . The HA . 11 mouse monoclonal antibody ( Covance ) was used at a 1 : 250 dilution to detect Kex2 - HA by immunofluorescence .

Role for Drs2p in Late Golgi Function 1225 take ( Vida and Emr , 1995 ) , and Ste3p turnover ( Davis et al . , 1993 ) experi - ments were performed as previously described . Ste3p - myc was detected with 9E10 c - myc antibody ( Oncogene Research Products ) and HRP - con - jugated secondary antibodies ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , Inc . ) followed by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection ( Amersham Corp . ) . Subcellular Fractionation and Preparation of Clathrin - coated Vesicles Subcellular fractionation was performed as previously described ( Phan et al . , 1994 ) , except that cells were converted to spheroplasts and washed twice in buffer containing 0 . 8 M sorbitol before lysing with a Dounce ho - mogenizer in buffer A containing 0 . 1 mg / ml RNase A . The cells were pre - incubated for 1 h at 15 (cid:56) or 30 (cid:56) C , lysed , and subjected to centrifugation at 13 , 000 g and the resulting supernatant was then centrifuged at 100 , 000 g . Immunoblots bearing 20 (cid:109) g of protein from each sample were probed with mouse antibodies to Chc1p ( Lemmon et al . , 1988 ) , Aps1 and Aps2 ( Phan et al . , 1994 ) , and ARF1 ( Kahn et al . , 1995 ) . Clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) were prepared from SEY6210 and 6210 drs2 (cid:68) as previously de - scribed ( Mueller and Branton , 1984 ) . For 15 (cid:56) C - treated samples , cells from a 3 - liter culture grown to 6 – 8 OD were collected , resuspended into 1 liter of pre - chilled fresh YPD , and incubated at 15 (cid:56) C for 1 h before further pro - cessing . After gel filtration chromatography , 1 . 2 ml of every other fraction ( total 5 ml per fraction ) from fractions 15 – 35 were precipitated with TCA ( 10 % final concentration ) . The precipitates were resuspended in 50 (cid:109) l Laemmli sample buffer , and one third of each sample was subjected to im - munoblotting and probed with antibodies to Chc1p , Mnn1p ( Graham et al . , 1994 ) , and Pep12p ( Seaman et al . , 1998 ) . Electron Microscopy Spheroplasts were prepared for electron microscopy as previously de - scribed ( Rieder et al . , 1996 ) except that the initial glutaraldehyde fixation was overnight at 4 (cid:56) C . 50 – 60 - nm sections were viewed on an electron mi - croscope ( CM12 ; Philips ) . Vesicle fractions were similarly prepared , but included the following modifications : 5 - ml fractions were fixed overnight at 4 (cid:56) C by addition of 700 (cid:109) l of 25 % glutaraldehyde ( 3 % final concentra - tion ) . Fixed vesicles were pelleted at 100 , 000 g for 70 min . The vesicle pel - let was washed in 100 mM sodium cacodylate , pH 6 . 8 , 5 mM CaCl 2 , and then stained identically to the cell blocks , with one exception . A 30 - min room temperature incubation with 1 % tannic acid in 100 mM sodium ca - codylate , pH 7 . 4 , was included before en bloc staining with uranyl acetate . Dehydration , embedding , and section poststaining were performed as for the cell samples . Preparation of Antiserum Against Drs2p A TrpE - DRS2 fusion construct was prepared by ligating the BglII / HindIII cut DRS2 fragment ( 1 , 180 bp ) from pPR10 into the BamHI / HindIII - digested pATH2 vector ( Koerner et al . , 1991 ) . The resulting plasmid con - tained an in - frame fusion between TrpE and a region of Drs2p ( amino ac - ids 528 – 920 ) carrying ATPase motifs and predicted to be a cytoplasmic loop . This plasmid was transformed into JM101 cells and the resulting fu - sion protein was expressed and purified by the method of Koerner et al . ( 1991 ) , except that the procedure was scaled up 10 - fold to increase yield . Also , cracking buffer ( 10 mM sodium phosphate , pH 7 . 2 , 1 % (cid:98) - mercapto - ethanol , 1 % SDS , 6 M urea ) ( Kleid et al . , 1981 ) was used together with sonication to resuspend the insoluble portion of the total cell lysate before separation by preparative SDS - PAGE . The band from the preparative gel corresponding to the TrpE / Drs2 fusion protein was cut out and electro - eluted using an Elutrap ( Schleicher & Schuell , Inc . ) . Polyclonal rabbit an - tiserum to the Drs2 - TrpE fusion protein was prepared at Scantibodies Laboratory . Drs2p antibodies were affinity purified twice as described ( Pringle et al . , 1991 ) using 500 (cid:109) g of gel purified TrpE / Drs2 fusion protein bound to an Immobilon ( Millipore Corp . ) strip by capillary action . Affin - ity - purified anti – Drs2p antibody was used at a concentration of 1 : 1 , 000 for immunofluorescence and 1 : 2 , 000 for Western blots . Cell lysates for West - ern blots were prepared by vortexing cells with glass beads in SDS - urea sample buffer ( 40 mM Tris - HCl , pH 6 . 8 , 8 M urea , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 1 % (cid:98) - mercaptoethanol , 5 % SDS ) and heating at 50 (cid:56) C for 5 min . Boiling of samples caused aggregation of Drs2p such that the protein would remain in the stacking gel during SDS - PAGE . Results drs2 (cid:68) Is Synthetically Lethal with arf1 (cid:68) and chc1 - ts Alleles To clone the SWA3 gene , a yeast genomic library ( CEN , LEU2 ) was used to transform the swa3 - 1 mutant , and the transformants were screened for complementation of the cold - sensitive growth and arf1 (cid:68) synthetic lethal pheno - types . A single library plasmid was isolated that was able to complement both mutant phenotypes and further sub - cloning analyses revealed that a 5 - kb SpeI - SnaBI genomic fragment containing the full - length DRS2 gene ( and no other open reading frame , ORF ) retained the comple - menting activity ( see Materials and Methods ) . A drs2 null strain was generated by replacing most of the DRS2 coding sequences with TRP1 . Consistent with the phenotype previously reported for drs2 (cid:68) strains ( Rip - master et al . , 1993 ) and that exhibited by the swa3 mutants ( Chen and Graham , 1998 ) , the drs2 (cid:68) null mutant was un - able to grow at 20 (cid:56) C or below , but grew well at tempera - tures above 23 (cid:56) C . Linkage analysis indicated that SWA3 is allelic to DRS2 , and synthetic lethality between arf1 (cid:68) and drs2 (cid:68) was confirmed by crossing the single mutants and characterizing the progeny by tetrad analysis ( Fig . 1 A and data not shown ) . This genetic interaction suggested that Drs2p may be involved in an ARF - dependent vesi - cle - mediated protein transport event ( s ) . To determine if drs2 (cid:68) would exhibit synthetic lethality with other mutations that perturb transport vesicle forma - tion , we crossed drs2 (cid:68) with strains harboring ts mutations in subunits of COPI ( ret1 - 1 , sec21 - 1 , and sec27 - 1 encoding (cid:97) , (cid:103) , (cid:98)(cid:57) - COP , respectively ) , the ER transport vesicle coat Figure 1 . drs2 (cid:68) is synthetically lethal with arf1 (cid:68) , chc1 , and pan1 alleles . ( A ) Genetic analyses between drs2 (cid:68) and mutations that perturb the secretory pathway . Strains carrying the indicated mu - tations ( see Materials and Methods ) were crossed with a drs2 (cid:68) mutant ( 6210 drs2 (cid:68) or PRY6222 ) to generate diploids . After tet - rad analyses of the progeny , the viable double mutants were streaked at 20 (cid:56) , 26 . 5 (cid:56) , and 37 (cid:56) C to compare the growth relative to parental strains carrying single mutations . * Double mutants of the alleles and drs2 that were able to grow at 20 (cid:56) C , where single drs2 mutants could not . † Double mutants that grew more slowly than either single mutant at 26 . 5 (cid:56) C . ( B ) Tetrad analysis of prog - eny derived from crossing PRY6222 ( drs2 (cid:68) ) with 6210 chc1 - 5 ( chc1 - 5 ) . Spores that failed to grow were predicted to be drs2 (cid:68) chc1 - 5 double mutants . on A p r il 16 , 2008 www . j c b . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 147 , 1999 1226 COPII ( sec12 - 1 and sec23 - 1 ) , and the clathrin heavy chain ( chc1 - 5 , chc1 - (cid:68) 57 , chc1 - 521 ) , and analyzed the progeny by tetrad dissection . All of the sec drs2 (cid:68) and the ret1 drs2 (cid:68) double mutants were obtained at the expected frequency ( approximately one fourth of the progeny ) and most grew well at 26 . 5 (cid:56) C ( Fig . 1 A ) . The exception was sec21 - 1 drs2 (cid:68) mutants , which grew somewhat more slowly at this tem - perature than either single mutant . Among those growing well at 26 . 5 (cid:56) C , double mutants harboring drs2 (cid:68) and sec12 - 1 or sec23 - 1 also grew at 20 (cid:56) C , which is a nonpermissive tem - perature for drs2 (cid:68) single mutants . This suggests that sec12 and sec23 are able to partially suppress the cold - sensitive growth defect of drs2 (cid:68) , and that COPII may act upstream of Drs2p . In stark contrast , chc1 - ts drs2 (cid:68) double mutants were nearly always inviable . All of the spores that failed to grow in the tetrad analysis shown in Fig . 1 B were predicted to be chc1 - 5 drs2 (cid:68) double mutants based on the genotype of the viable spores from each tetrad . The drs2 (cid:68) and chc1 - 5 single mutants grew nearly as well as wild - type progeny at this temperature ( 26 . 5 (cid:56) C , Fig . 1 B ; e . g . , spores 3c , 3d , and 3b are drs2 (cid:68) , chc1 - 5 , and wild - type , respectively ) . Mi - croscopic examination of the plates indicated that the drs2 (cid:68) chc1 - 5 spores germinated and divided a few times to form microcolonies , indicating that mitotic growth , rather than germination , was impaired . In addition , this genetic interaction was not allele - specific since all three of the chc1 ts alleles tested were synthetically lethal with drs2 (cid:68) ( Fig . 1 A ) . To further address the specificity of the synthetic lethal interaction between drs2 (cid:68) , arf1 (cid:68) , and chc1 - ts alleles , we crossed drs2 (cid:68) with several mutants that exhibit a defect in protein transport through the secretory or endocytic path - ways . Double mutants combining drs2 (cid:68) with sec1 - 1 , sec7 - 1 , sec14 - 1 , sec18 - 1 , vps15 (cid:68) , vps21 (cid:68) , vps33 (cid:68) , vps35 (cid:68) , ypt7 (cid:68) , or end4 - 1 were obtained at the expected frequency , al - though the end4 - 1 drs2 (cid:68) , vps33 (cid:68) drs2 (cid:68) , and sec18 - 1 drs2 (cid:68) mutants exhibited a slow growth phenotype . Interestingly , a mutant allele of the yeast Eps15 homologue , pan1 - 20 , was also synthetically lethal with drs2 (cid:68) ( Fig . 1 A ) . Eps15 is a cytoplasmic protein that localizes to clathrin - coated pits and may have an adaptor - like function in clathrin coated vesicle formation ( van Delft et al . , 1997 ; Wendland and Emr , 1998 ) . Of particular note was the lack of genetic in - teractions with sec7 and sec14 , which both perturb protein transport through the yeast Golgi complex . The drs2 (cid:68) Mutant Secretes Pro – (cid:97) - Factor at the Nonpermissive Temperature One of the more striking phenotypes of yeast clathrin mu - tants is the mislocalization of several late Golgi ( TGN ) proteins that are required for pro – (cid:97) - factor proteolytic processing . This results in the secretion of fully glycosy - lated pro – (cid:97) - factor rather than the mature peptide ( Payne and Schekman , 1989 ) . If clathrin function at the TGN is perturbed in the drs2 (cid:68) mutant , we would expect this mu - tant to secrete pro – (cid:97) - factor . To test this , wild - type , drs2 (cid:68) , and clc1 (cid:68) ( clathrin light chain null ) strains were grown at 30 (cid:56) C , and after shifting to 20 (cid:56) C for 1 h , were metabolically labeled and chased at this nonpermissive temperature for drs2 (cid:68) . Aliquots of cells were removed at the chase times indicated in Fig . 2 , converted to spheroplasts , and then centrifuged to separate intracellular ( I ) from extracellular ( E ) fractions . (cid:97) - Factor was then recovered from each sam - ple by immunoprecipitation . At the beginning of the chase , labeled (cid:97) - factor was present throughout the secretory pathway of the cells , as indicated by the presence of the core glycosylated ER pro - form , Golgi - modified hyperglycosylated proforms and the mature form ( Fig . 2 , lanes 1 , 7 , and 13 ) . In wild - type cells , complete proteolytic processing of pro – (cid:97) - factor occurred within 15 min , and most of the mature (cid:97) - factor was se - creted and degraded in the extracellular space . However , the clc1 (cid:68) cells were clearly deficient in the processing of pro – (cid:97) - factor , and most of the hyperglycosylated precursor was secreted into the extracellular space within 15 min , as previously reported ( Fig . 2 , lane 18 ; Chu et al . , 1996 ) . Sim - ilarly , the drs2 (cid:68) mutant secreted the hyperglycosylated pro – (cid:97) - factor and partially processed (cid:97) - factor forms into the extracellular space ( Fig . 2 , lanes 10 and 12 ) . The drs2 (cid:68) mutant also exhibited a modest defect in Golgi - specific glycosylation since the hyperglycosylated pro – (cid:97) - factor se - creted from drs2 (cid:68) cells showed a slightly faster mobility within the SDS - polyacrylamide gel relative to that from the clc1 (cid:68) strains . The kinetics of pro – (cid:97) - factor secretion at this temperature ( 20 (cid:56) C ) was nearly equivalent to that of clc1 (cid:68) cells . These results indicate that late Golgi function is specifically perturbed in the drs2 (cid:68) cells and suggest a loss of clathrin function at the TGN at the nonpermissive temperature . In pulse – chase experiments performed at 30 (cid:56) C , most of pro – (cid:97) - factor was processed and secreted as the mature form from drs2 (cid:68) cells ( data not shown ) , indi - cating that this defect was temperature conditional . More - over , the pro – (cid:97) - factor processing defect was observed within 15 min of preincubation at 20 (cid:56) C , suggesting a rapid onset of the temperature conditional phenotype ( data not shown ) .

Role for Drs2p in Late Golgi Function 1227 The drs2 (cid:68) Mutant Exhibits an Endosomal Defect To examine protein transport through the endocytic path - way of drs2 (cid:68) cells , we followed the turnover of the (cid:97) - fac - tor receptor , Ste3p , which is constitutively endocytosed and delivered to the yeast vacuole where it is degraded ( Davis et al . , 1993 ) . A c - myc tagged Ste3p expressed from a galactose - regulated promoter ( Davis et al . , 1993 ) was used so new Ste3p synthesis can be shut off by shifting the cells to glucose . Wild - type , drs2 (cid:68) , and arf1 (cid:68) cells were grown in galactose at 30 (cid:56) C to induce expression of the con - struct and populate the plasma membrane with the Ste3 - myc protein . Glucose was added to the culture , which was then shifted to 15 (cid:56) C , and the disappearance of Ste3 - myc was followed over time by immunoblotting . Even though the arf1 (cid:68) mutant displays an abnormal endosome mor - phology ( Gaynor et al . , 1998 ) , the kinetics of Ste3p trans - port to the vacuole as measured by Ste3 - myc degradation was very similar to that of wild - type cells ( Fig . 3 A , arf1 (cid:68) ) . In contrast , the rate of Ste3 - myc turnover was three - to fivefold slower in the drs2 (cid:68) cells ( Fig . 3 A , drs2 (cid:68) ) com - pared with wild type , suggesting a defect in endocytosis . To control for recovery of protein in each sample , the same blots were probed for carboxypeptidase Y ( CPY ) , which was recovered equally in each sample ( data not shown ) . drs2 (cid:68) cells cultured in glucose did not express Ste3p - myc , indicating that glucose repression of the GAL promoter was not perturbed ( data not shown ) . Again , this phenotype was temperature conditional since the rate of Ste3 - myc turnover at 30 (cid:56) C in the drs2 (cid:68) strain was only slightly ( 1 . 4 - fold ) slower than the wild - type strain ( data not shown ) . Clathrin mutants display a similar defect in Ste3p turn - over caused by inefficient internalization of the receptor from the plasma membrane ( Tan et al . , 1993 ) . However , examination of drs2 (cid:68) cells by immunofluorescence local - ization of Ste3p - myc at each time point after glucose was added indicated an accumulation of Ste3 - myc in intracel - lular structures with very little plasma membrane staining ( data not shown ) . This result suggested that transport of Ste3p from the endosome to the vacuole , rather than inter - nalization from the plasma membrane , was perturbed . To more specifically test whether uptake from the plasma membrane or transport from endosomes to the vacuole was defective in drs2 (cid:68) cells at the nonpermissive temperature , we stained cells with the fluorescent en - docytic marker FM4 - 64 ( Vida and Emr , 1995 ) on ice , and then shifted the cultures to 15 (cid:56) C to initiate endocytosis of the dye ( Fig . 3 B ) . The FM4 - 64 was rapidly cleared from the plasma membrane of both wild - type and drs2 (cid:68) cells ( data not shown ) , and in wild - type cells it was delivered to the vacuole membrane in 30 – 60 min ( WT , 1 h ) . In con - trast , the FM4 - 64 accumulated in endosomes of drs2 (cid:68) cells , which appear as punctate fluorescent spots in Fig . 3 B ( drs2 (cid:68) , 1 h ) . Even after 4 h at 15 (cid:56) C , most of the FM4 - 64 was not in the vacuoles and stained what appeared to be clusters of smaller structures ( drs2 (cid:68) , 4 h ) . As the drs2 (cid:68) cells warmed up on the microscope stage , the FM4 - 64 was rapidly delivered to the vacuoles at all times tested , in - dicating that the defect was fully reversible ( data not shown ) . In addition , vacuoles in drs2 (cid:68) cells that were stained with FM4 - 64 at 30 (cid:56) C did not appreciably fragment when the cells were shifted to 15 (cid:56) C ( data not shown ) , so the structures stained at 15 (cid:56) C were indeed endosomes and not fragmented vacuoles . These studies indicated that the endocytic defect ob - served in drs2 (cid:68) cells was attributable to a defect in the en - dosome - to - vacuole pathway rather than clathrin - depen - dent endocytosis from the plasma membrane . If so , CPY transport should be affected as well since this protein fol - lows a TGN to endosome to vacuole delivery route . To test this , we examined the transport of CPY to the vacuole in the drs2 (cid:68) mutant . CPY is synthesized in the ER as the p1 precursor form and is modified on N - linked oligosac - charides by the Golgi (cid:97) 1 , 3 mannosyltransferase ( Mnn1p ) to form the p2 precursor . p2 CPY is sorted from secreted proteins in the TGN and ultimately processed to the ma - ture form in the vacuole ( Stevens et al . , 1982 ) . Wild - type , drs2 (cid:68) , and arf1 (cid:68) cells were pulse - labeled and chased at either the permissive or nonpermissive temperature of drs2 (cid:68) . Aliquots of cells were removed at the chase times indicated and CPY was recovered by immunoprecipita - tion . As shown in Fig . 4 , drs2 (cid:68) cells displayed near wild - Figure 3 . The drs2 (cid:68) mutant exhibits a cold - sensitive defect in the endocytic pathway . ( A ) Wild - type , drs2 (cid:68) , and arf1 (cid:68) strains were transformed with a plasmid carrying the Ste3 - myc construct ( pSL2624 ; Givan and Sprague , 1997 ) and grown to early log phase in galactose to induce expression of the STE3 - myc protein . Glucose was added to 3 % final concentration to repress new syn - thesis of Ste3 - myc and the cultures were shifted to 15 (cid:56) C . Lysates were prepared at the times indicated and immunoblotted for Ste3 - myc using the 9E10 c - myc antibody . ( B ) Wild - type and drs2 (cid:68) cells were stained with FM4 - 64 on ice and shifted to 15 (cid:56) C to initiate endocytosis of the dye .

The partial glycosylation defect observed in drs2 (cid:68) ( and arf1 (cid:68) cells ) prevented the formation of a p2 CPY form that could be resolved from the p1 form in SDS - polyacryl - amide gels . Thus , the kinetics of ER - to - Golgi transport could not be assessed for CPY . However , the ER - to - Golgi transport kinetics for (cid:97) - factor and invertase in drs2 (cid:68) cells was found to be nearly wild type at the nonpermissive temperature , as scored by disappearance of the ER core form ( Fig . 2 , and data not shown ) . Therefore , it is unlikely that ER - to - Golgi transport for CPY is disturbed in drs2 (cid:68) cells . These data are most consistent with the interpreta - tion that protein transport from the late Golgi or endo - somes to the vacuole is perturbed by the drs2 (cid:68) mutation . Interestingly , the chc1 - 5 allele isolated in the arf1 (cid:68) syn - thetic lethal screen also exhibits a partial glycosylation de - fect and an approximately threefold slower transport ki - netics for CPY ( Chen and Graham , 1998 ) . The drs2 (cid:68) Mutant Accumulates Abnormal Membrane - bound Structures Similar to Berkeley Bodies Most of the sec mutants that exhibit a temperature - condi - tional block in protein transport also accumulate an or - ganelle or vesicular intermediate of the secretory pathway at the nonpermissive temperature . For example , the sec7 Figure 4 . The drs2 (cid:68) mutant exhibits a cold - sensitive kinetic de - fect in CPY transport to the vacuole .

Role for Drs2p in Late Golgi Function 1229 and sec14 mutations block protein transport out of the Golgi complex and accumulate Golgi structures called Berkeley bodies ( Novick et al . , 1980 ) . The Golgi cisternae in these mutants are sometimes stacked and appear to adopt a deep , cup - shaped morphology that in electron mi - crographs of thin sections present double - membrane ring or crescent shaped structures depending on the section plane . Clathrin mutants also exhibit aberrant membrane structures similar to Berkeley bodies , although these struc - tures are rarely stacked ( Payne et al . , 1987 ) . Morphological studies by electron microscopy revealed that drs2 (cid:68) cells accumulated aberrant double - membrane ring and crescent - shaped structures at both 15 (cid:56) and 30 (cid:56) C ( Fig . 5 , A and B ) . The double - membrane rings in the drs2 (cid:68) cells measured 200 – 250 nm in diameter ( average , 240 nm ) and often presented a significant gap between the concentric membranes , which should be equivalent to the luminal space of the cisternae . Representative double - membrane ring structures are marked with white arrow - heads in Fig . 5 A . Very similar ring structures also accu - mulated in the chc1 (cid:68) mutant ( Fig . 5 C ; Payne et al . , 1987 ) . These types of structures were never observed in wild - type cells ; however , ring structures could be found that were more highly fenestrated and appeared to be breaking down into tubules or vesicles ( Fig . 5 D , arrowhead ) . In fact , similar fenestrated ring structures accumulate dra - matically in arf1 (cid:68) cells ( Gaynor et al . , 1998 ) . Some of the double - membrane rings in the drs2 (cid:68) cells were also mod - estly fenestrated ( Fig . 5 A , black arrow ) . To quantitate the effect of temperature on the accumu - lation of ring structures in wild - type and drs2 (cid:68) cells , these cells were grown at 26 . 5 (cid:56) C and shifted to the temperature indicated in Fig . 5 E for 2 h before fixation . Regions con - taining 23 – 25 cell sections were randomly selected and the number of crescent - shaped structures , double - membrane rings , and vesicles ( 50 – 100 - nm spheres ) were counted and expressed as the number of structures per cell section . Rel - ative to the wild - type strain , the drs2 (cid:68) mutant accumu - lated four - to eightfold more crescent and ring structures at the temperatures examined ( Fig . 5 E ) . In this analysis , structures similar to that shown in Fig . 5 D were counted as rings in the wild - type cells . There was also a greater ac - cumulation of these structures in the drs2 (cid:68) cells at the colder temperatures , which was particularly evident for the double - membrane rings . The number of vesicles in the drs2 (cid:68) cells dropped modestly at the colder temperatures , although within the range of values observed for the wild - type cells . Golgi membranes that accumulate at the nonpermissive temperature in the sec7 mutant have been reported to be - come more extensively stacked in low glucose medium ( Novick et al . , 1980 ) . Some structures appear stacked in the drs2 (cid:68) mutant grown in 2 % glucose ( Fig . 5 B , arrow ) , but no significant difference was observed in the morphol - ogy of the membranes accumulating in drs2 (cid:68) cells incu - bated in low glucose ( 0 . 1 % ) medium for 2 h at the nonper - missive temperature . However , the effect of low glucose on Berkeley body structure in a sec7 mutant in our strain background was modest ( data not shown ) . Plasma membrane invaginations have been proposed to represent endocytic intermediates in yeast ( Mulholland et al . , 1999 ) and are extended in some mutants that exhibit a defect in endocytosis [ for example , sjl1 sjl2 ( Srinivasan et al . , 1997 ) and pan1 ( Wendland et al . , 1996 ) ] . However , no difference in the depth of plasma membrane invagina - tions between wild - type and drs2 (cid:68) cells was observed un - der any of the growth conditions described above . Reduction of Intact Clathrin - coated Vesicles that Can Be Isolated from the drs2 (cid:68) Mutant A mammalian cytosolic ARF guanine nucleotide ex - change factor requires both PS and phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate for optimal membrane binding and sub - sequent activation of ARF ( Chardin et al . , 1996 ) . This observation suggested a requirement for Drs2p ( a poten - tial PS translocase ) to recruit ARF and clathrin to mem - branes . To test whether Drs2p plays a role in regulating ARF activation and therefore association of ARF and clathrin with membranes , we fractionated both wild - type and drs2 (cid:68) cellular lysates by differential centrifugation to compare the amounts of ARF , clathrin , and adaptin sub - units recovered in the 13 , 000 - g pellets , and the 100 , 000 - g pellets and supernatants . A small increase in the amount of clathrin heavy chain found in the 100 , 000 - g supernatant fraction was occasionally observed in the mutant samples relative to the wild - type samples at both 15 (cid:56) and 30 (cid:56) C ; oth - erwise , the fractionation pattern for clathrin was very simi - lar between the two strains ( data not shown ) . In addition , the fractionation pattern for ARF and the two adaptin small subunits ( Aps1p for AP - 1 and Aps2p for AP - 2 ) was nearly identical between drs2 (cid:68) and wild - type samples . Therefore , the association of ARF and clathrin with bulk cellular membranes seemed to be unaffected in the drs2 (cid:68) mutant , although we cannot rule out the possibility that the distribution of ARF between specific organelles is per - turbed . To further assess clathrin function in the drs2 (cid:68) mutants , we asked whether CCVs could be purified from this mu - tant . CCV preparations were generated from drs2 (cid:68) and wild - type cells with or without a 1 - h shift to 15 (cid:56) C ( see Ma - terials and Methods ) . Cell lysates were centrifuged at 21 , 000 g for 30 min to pellet large organellar membranes ( e . g . , plasma membrane , vacuolar membrane , ER , and mi - tochondria ) and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100 , 000 g to pellet vesicles . The 100 , 000 - g pellet was then applied to a Sephacryl S - 1000 gel filtration column ( Mueller and Branton , 1984 ) , and the fractions were probed for the clathrin heavy chain by immunoblotting . As shown in Fig . 6 A , the clathrin heavy chain was highly enriched in fractions 23 to 27 for both wild - type and drs2 (cid:68) samples from cells shifted to 15 (cid:56) C ( Fig . 6 A ) or 30 (cid:56) C ( Fig . 7 D , and data not shown ) . In addition , from Coomassie blue – stained gels , we estimated that the recovery of clath - rin heavy chain in these fractions was comparable for both strains at both temperatures ( data not shown ) . However , a clear difference between wild - type and mu - tant samples was evident when fractions highly enriched for the clathrin heavy chain were examined by EM . Peak clathrin fractions obtained from wild - type cells were sub - stantially enriched in CCVs with a clear lipid bilayer present in a substantial number of the vesicle profiles ( Fig . 6 C , arrowheads ) . In contrast , most of the vesicle profiles in the drs2 (cid:68) peak clathrin fractions contained an electron on A p r il 16 , 2008 www . j c b . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 147 , 1999 1230 dense center , but no lipid bilayer within the clathrin basket ( Fig . 6 D , open arrowheads ) . In addition , the drs2 (cid:68) frac - tions contained what appeared to be partially assembled clathrin lattices ( Fig . 6 D , arrow ) that were rarely ob - served in wild - type fractions . CCVs with a lipid bilayer were occasionally observed in the drs2 (cid:68) fractions , but were found at (cid:44) 1 / 10 of the frequency per section as com - pared with the wild - type samples ( multiple sections from three different preparations were compared ) . This was a temperature - conditional phenomenon as CCV prepara - tions from drs2 (cid:68) cells maintained at a permissive tempera - ture were indistinguishable from wild - type samples ( data not shown ) . It is well established that clathrin triskelions can self as - semble into baskets in slightly acidic , low ionic strength buffers ( Schmid , 1997 , and references therein ) . The method we used for isolating CCVs from yeast applies such buffer conditions to retain assembled coats on vesi - cles . In addition , the lysate is incubated for 30 min at 30 (cid:56) C with RNase to reduce the amount of ribonucleoprotein complexes in the P100 sample . These conditions are likely to induce assembly of free clathrin triskelions into baskets and lattices within the drs2 (cid:68) cell lysate . It appears that these clathrin structures pellet at 100 , 000 g and elute from the S - 1000 column in similar fractions as bona fide CCVs . The simplest interpretation of these data is that the drs2 (cid:68) cells are deficient in producing CCVs at the nonpermissive temperature . It is also possible that clathrin dissociates more readily from CCVs produced in drs2 (cid:68) cells and reas - sembles into baskets during purification , thus preventing the isolation of bona fide CCVs . In either case , there is a marked difference between drs2 (cid:68) and wild - type cells ei - ther in the ability to produce CCVs or in the physical properties of CCVs from these strains . Even though most large membranes pellet at 21 , 000 g , we had noticed by EM that the 100 , 000 - g pellet from drs2 (cid:68) cells ( that was applied to the S1000 column ) contained a significant number of aberrant membrane structures that were similar in appearance and size to those observed in cell sections ( Fig . 5 B ) . Because drs2 (cid:68) cells exhibited both Golgi and endosome - associated defects , it was possible that both organelles would accumulate in the drs2 (cid:68) mu - tant . Therefore , we examined the S1000 column fractions from the CCV preparations for membranes containing a late Golgi protein , (cid:97) 1 , 3 - mannosyltransferase ( Mnn1p ) , and an endosomal t - SNARE , Pep12p ( Fig . 6 A ) . In frac - tions from wild - type cells , Mnn1p eluted slightly later than clathrin , which likely represents small vesicles or small Golgi fragments . However , a substantial change in the elu - tion profile of Mnn1p - containing membranes was ob - served in fractions from drs2 (cid:68) cells . A peak of Mnn1p eluted just after the void volume and spread from fractions 16 – 31 . This change in Mnn1p distribution was observed with samples prepared from drs2 (cid:68) cells incubated at both 15 (cid:56) C ( Fig . 6 A ) and 30 (cid:56) C ( data not shown ) , and correlated with the large membrane structures observed by EM in these fractions ( e . g . , Fig . 6 B , fraction 16 ) . Membranes of any sort were difficult to find by EM in fraction 16 from wild - type samples ( data not shown ) . Relative to Mnn1p , a wider distribution of Pep12p - containing membranes was found in the S1000 fractions from wild - type cells . However , the Pep12p elution profile was not significantly Figure 6 . The drs2 (cid:68) mutant ac - cumulates aberrant Golgi mem - branes and exhibits a deficiency of clathrin - coated vesicles .

The 21 , 000 - g supernatant was centrifuged at 100 , 000 g for 80 min to generate a 100 , 000 - g pellet . This pellet was resuspended and further re - solved on a Sephacryl S - 1000 column .

Role for Drs2p in Late Golgi Function 1231 different between the wild - type and drs2 (cid:68) fractions ( Fig . 6 A ) . These data suggest that the abnormal membrane structures that accumulate in the drs2 (cid:68) cells are Golgi membranes and not endosomal membranes . Drs2p Localizes to Late Golgi Membranes Containing Kex2p and Mnn1p To analyze the intracellular localization of Drs2p , we pre - pared a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against a bacterially expressed fragment of Drs2p ( amino acid residues 528 – 920 ) . Affinity - purified anti – Drs2p antibodies recognized an (cid:122) 150 - kD protein on an immunoblot of a wild - type cell lysate ( Fig . 7 A , DRS2 ) , which is in close agreement to the predicted mass of 154 kD . This protein was not present in a drs2 (cid:68) cell lysate and was found in greater abundance in wild - type strain carrying DRS2 on a multicopy plasmid ( Fig . 7 A , drs2 (cid:68) and 2 (cid:109) DRS2 ) . Thus , the 150 - kD protein is equivalent to Drs2p . Drs2p was recently suggested to localize to the plasma membrane based on cofractionation of an epitope - tagged Drs2p with the plasma membrane ATPase , Pma1p , in su - crose gradient fractions from a crude cell lysate ( Siegmund et al . , 1998 ) . However , we found that membranes contain - ing Drs2p could be quantitatively separated from mem - branes containing Pma1p by differential centrifugation as described above for the CCV preparations . Equal amounts of protein from the lysate ( L ) , pellet ( P21 ) , and supernatant ( S21 ) of 21 , 000 g and pellet ( P100 ) and super - natant ( S100 ) of 100 , 000 g were probed for Drs2p and Pma1p . Nearly all of Drs2p remained in the supernatant after centrifuging at 21 , 000 g ( S21 ) while most of Pma1p was found in the pellet ( P21 ) ( Fig . 7 B ) . All of the Drs2p in the S21 was pelleted during the subsequent 100 , 000 - g cen - trifugation step and was found in the P100 fraction . The fractionation profile for Drs2p shown in Fig . 7 B is very similar to how CCV and late Golgi proteins such as Kex2p fractionate . To further characterize the localization of Drs2p , a P100 fraction was applied to the bottom of a sucrose gradient and centrifuged to equilibrium ( Reynolds et al . , 1998 ) . Fractions were collected from the top and probed for Drs2p and Mnn1p and assayed for GDPase and Kex2p ( Fig . 7 C ) . GDPase marks early Golgi compart - ments , Kex2p the late Golgi ( or TGN ) , and Mnn1p is typi - cally split between these two regions of the gradient . The fractionation pattern for Drs2p clearly matches that of Kex2p ( Fig . 7 C ) . In similar gradients , we found that the endosomal marker Pep12p was broadly distributed throughout the gradient ( data not shown ) , although others have observed a defined peak in fractions significantly lighter than that of Kex2p ( Becherer et al . , 1996 ) . In no case did the Pep12p fractionation pattern match with that of Drs2p . In addition , the S1000 column elution profile of membranes containing Drs2p ( from wild - type cells grown at 30 (cid:56) C ) matched that of membranes containing Mnn1p ( Fig . 7 D ) . The Drs2p elution profile overlapped that of CCVs ( Fig . 7 D ) , raising the possibility that some Drs2p is present within the CCVs . This possibility is currently being tested ; however , it appeared that the bulk of Drs2p resides in Golgi membranes . To determine whether Drs2p and Kex2p reside in the same membrane structures , wild - type cells overexpressing a hemagglutinin ( HA ) - tagged Kex2p were stained simul - taneously with antibodies to Drs2p and HA . Localization of Drs2p by immunofluorescence produced a punctate staining pattern that is typical for the yeast Golgi complex ( Fig . 8 , WT (cid:49) 2 (cid:109) KEX2HA , (cid:97) - Drs2p ) . Although the sig - Figure 7 . Drs2p cofractionates with high - density membranes containing the late Golgi markers , Kex2p and Mnn1p . ( A ) Speci - ficity of the Drs2p antibodies . Wild - type , drs2 (cid:68) , and SEY6210 pRS425 - DRS2 ( 2 (cid:109) DRS2 ) cells were grown at 30 (cid:56) C before lysing with glass beads in SDS - urea sample buffer . Total cellular pro - teins ( 0 . 1 OD per lane ) were subjected to SDS - PAGE and immu - noblotted with affinity - purified antibodies against Drs2p . ( B ) Wild - type cells grown at 30 (cid:56) C were lysed ( lysate , L ) and sub - jected to centrifugation at 21 , 000 g for 30 min to generate pellet ( P21 ) and supernatant ( S21 ) fractions . The S21 fraction was fur - ther centrifuged at 100 , 000 g for 80 min to generate pellet ( P100 ) and supernatant ( S100 ) fractions . 20 (cid:109) g of total protein per frac - tion was immunoblotted for Drs2p and the plasma membrane ATPase , Pma1p . ( C ) Wild - type cells grown at 30 (cid:56) C were lysed and subjected to differential centrifugation and sucrose gradient fractionation of the P100 fraction . These gradient fractions have been previously used to examine Mnn1p distribution in Figure 6 a of Reynolds et al . ( 1998 ) . Equal volumes per gradient fraction were assayed by enzyme activity for Kex2p or GDPase and by immunoblotting for Drs2p , Mnn1p , and Pep12p . ( D ) Wild - type cells were grown at 30 (cid:56) C , lysed , and subjected to differential cen - trifugation to produce a P100 fraction , which was then subjected to gel filtration chromatography as described in Fig . 6 . Samples of every other fraction from fraction 15 to 35 were assayed by im - munoblotting for the clathrin heavy chain ( Chc1p ) , the late Golgi protein Mnn1p and Drs2p . on A p r il 16 , 2008 www . j c b . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 147 , 1999 1232 nal was weak , it was clearly above the background staining observed for the drs2 (cid:68) strain ( Fig . 8 , drs2 (cid:68) ) . The HA anti - body also produced a punctate staining pattern ( Fig . 8 , WT (cid:49) 2 (cid:109) KEX2HA , (cid:97) - HA ) and , importantly , most of the structures that were positive for Drs2p also stained for Kex2 - HA . As expected , very little overlap was observed between Drs2p and the early Golgi marker Och1 - HA ( data not shown ) . We could not detect plasma membrane staining with the Drs2p antibodies , which is inconsistent with a previous re - port suggesting that Drs2p resides in the plasma mem - brane ( Siegmund et al . , 1998 ) . Overexpression of Drs2p from a multicopy plasmid resulted in an ER staining pat - tern ( Siegmund et al . , 1998 , and data not shown ) , so this method could not be used to enhance the signal . To deter - mine whether the lack of plasma membrane staining with Drs2p antibodies was due to a technical limitation , we tested whether we could detect plasma membrane staining for an antigen that is present in the Golgi , endosomes , and plasma membrane . Wild - type spheroplasts were stained with antibodies to (cid:97) 1 , 3 - linked mannose residues that are found on many glycoproteins . For these cells , staining of the plasma membrane is clearly observed as a stained rim around the cells ( Fig . 8 , anti – (cid:97) 1 , 3 ) . Thus , by both immu - nofluorescence and subcellular fractionation studies , it ap - pears that most , if not all , of Drs2p is found in late Golgi membranes . Mutation of Aspartic Acid 560 Abolishes Drs2p Function In Vivo Drs2p is predicted to be a P - type ATPase based on the presence of five well - conserved ATPase motifs involved in the binding and hydrolysis of ATP ( Fig . 9 A ) . For P - type ATPases , an aspartic acid within the second motif forms an aspartyl - phosphate catalytic intermediate that is essen - tial for ATP hydrolysis ( Allen and Green , 1976 ; Fagan and Saier , 1994 ) . Sequence alignments between Drs2p and other P - type ATPases predict that aspartic acid 560 ( D560 ) in Drs2p would form the aspartyl - phosphate inter - mediate ( Fig . 9 A ) . To test whether this amino acid is criti - cal for Drs2p function , we mutated D560 to either an as - paragine ( D560N ) or a glutamic acid ( D560E ) residue and examined the ability of the mutants to complement the cold - sensitive growth defect of the drs2 (cid:68) strain . These mu - tations would be expected to cause minimal structural Figure 8 . Drs2p colocalizes with Kex2p in internal , punctate membranes . The wild - type strain carrying the HA - tagged KEX2 on a 2 - (cid:109) m plasmid ( WT (cid:49) 2 (cid:109) KEX2HA ) , and the drs2 (cid:68) strain were grown overnight at 30 (cid:56) C in minimal medium . After dilution in rich medium to 0 . 2 OD 600 , the wild - type strain was shifted to 20 (cid:56) C and cultured for 7 h while the drs2 (cid:68) strain was cultured at 30 (cid:56) C for 5 h , and then shifted to 20 (cid:56) C for 2 h . Cells were then fixed and prepared for immunofluorescence as previously de - scribed ( Graham et al . , 1994 ) . Affinity - purified anti – Drs2p and monoclonal anti – HA antibodies were used in the top six panels to visualize Drs2p ( left ) and the HA - tagged Kex2p ( right ) in the same cells . The bottom two panels are DIC and immunofluores - cence images of wild - type cells grown at 20 (cid:56) C and labeled with an antibody specific for (cid:97) 1 , 3 - linked mannose . Notice how the punc - tate and rim staining pattern ( plasma membrane ) of (cid:97) 1 , 3 - man - nose epitopes is different from the punctate staining of Drs2p in wild - type cells . Figure 9 .

Role for Drs2p in Late Golgi Function 1233 changes in Drs2p , but should abolish the presumed ATP - ase activity of this protein . The drs2 (cid:68) strain carrying either the wild - type DRS2 gene ( Wild - type ) , an empty vector ( drs2 (cid:68) ) , or two independent isolates of each mutant ( D560N and D560E ) were tested for growth at 30 (cid:56) and 20 (cid:56) C ( Fig . 9 B ) . As previously reported , the drs2 (cid:68) strain failed to grow at 20 (cid:56) C , but grew well at 30 (cid:56) C . None of the strains carrying the D560 point mutations were able to grow at 20 (cid:56) C ( Fig . 9 B ) , even though each of the strains ex - pressed a wild - type level of Drs2p ( data not shown ) . These data support the assignment of Drs2p as a P - type ATPase and suggest that the ATPase activity of Drs2p is essential for its function in vivo . Discussion In this report , we present several lines of evidence that strongly implicate the integral membrane P - type ATPase Drs2p in late Golgi function , and suggest a link between Drs2p and CCV formation from Golgi membranes . ( a ) A specific synthetic lethal interaction was found between drs2 (cid:68) , arf1 (cid:68) , and chc1 - ts alleles . ( b ) The drs2 (cid:68) mutant ex - hibits a cold - sensitive defect in the proteolytic processing of pro – (cid:97) - factor in the yeast TGN that is comparable with the defect shown by clathrin mutants . ( c ) The drs2 (cid:68) mu - tant accumulates aberrant Golgi structures that are mor - phologically comparable to the membrane structures that accumulate in clathrin mutants . ( d ) We observed a sub - stantial decrease in the yield of CCVs that could be iso - lated from the drs2 (cid:68) mutant preincubated at the nonper - missive temperature . ( e ) Drs2p localizes to late Golgi membranes containing Kex2p . Specific Genetic Interactions between drs2 (cid:68) , arf1 (cid:68) , and chc1 - ts Alleles Our rationale for performing the arf1 (cid:68) synthetic lethal screen was that it could provide an unbiased , in vivo ap - proach to identify proteins that regulate ARF function , or participate with ARF in CCV or COPI vesicle formation . This was the first yeast genetic screen we are aware of that has uncovered a mutant allele of the clathrin heavy chain gene ( swa5 - 1 / chc1 - 5 ; Chen and Graham , 1998 ) . While mu - tations at many loci can influence the viability of a chc1 (cid:68) strain ( Munn et al . , 1991 ) , there are no other reports of mutations that are lethal in combination with chc1 - ts al - leles other than arf1 (cid:68) . This provides genetic support for the substantial biochemical evidence in the literature im - plicating ARF in clathrin recruitment to Golgi membranes ( Zhu et al . , 1998 , and references therein ) , and also pro - vides validation for the arf1 (cid:68) synthetic lethal approach . We were initially concerned about the specificity of the drs2 (cid:68) – arf1 (cid:68) synthetic lethal interaction , even though four alleles of the SWA3 / DRS2 gene were recovered in this ge - netic screen . However , from crosses with 19 different mu - tants that perturb the secretory or endocytic pathways , we found a specific interaction between pairwise combina - tions of arf1 (cid:68) , drs2 (cid:68) , and chc1 - ts alleles . The drs2 (cid:68) allele was also synthetically lethal with pan1 - 20 , an eps15 - related protein that interacts with yAP180 ( yeast homologue of clathrin assembly protein AP180 ) in a yeast two - hybrid as - say ( Wendland and Emr , 1998 ) . Importantly , there was no genetic interaction between drs2 (cid:68) and mutant ts alleles encoding three different COPI subunits , even though com - bination of arf1 (cid:68) with these COPI alleles produces a syn - thetic growth defect ( Gaynor et al . , 1998 ) . These results suggest that Drs2p is specifically involved in clathrin , but not COPI , function . This interpretation is supported by the finding that membranes containing Drs2p could be separated from early Golgi membranes where COPI would be expected to function , and cofractionated with late Golgi membranes where clathrin function is required . Phenotypes Exhibited by the drs2 (cid:68) Mutant These genetic analyses prompted us to examine the drs2 (cid:68) mutant for defects in the secretory and endocytic path - ways . The secretion kinetics and Golgi - specific glyco - sylation of pro – (cid:97) - factor and invertase were only modestly perturbed . However , a substantial cold - sensitive defect in the Kex2p - dependent processing of pro – (cid:97) - factor was ob - served . This resulted in secretion of the pro – (cid:97) - factor pre - cursor , a phenotype also exhibited by clathrin mutants ( Payne and Schekman , 1989 ) . Kinetic defects were also observed for CPY transport to the vacuole and the turn - over of the Ste3p pheromone receptor within the vacuole . These phenotypes are likely caused by a delay in endo - some - to - vacuole transport that was clearly observed using the fluorescent endocytic tracer FM4 - 64 . Thus , the drs2 (cid:68) mutation seems to specifically perturb late Golgi ( TGN ) and endosome function . As visualized by EM , the drs2 (cid:68) mutant accumulates ab - normal membrane - bound structures that were morpholog - ically equivalent to structures that accumulate in clathrin mutants . The abnormal membrane structures that were isolated from drs2 (cid:68) cells by differential centrifugation and gel exclusion chromatography were enriched for a late Golgi protein , but not for an endosomal marker protein . Since the localization studies suggest that Drs2p is a late Golgi ( TGN ) resident , these data strongly suggest that Drs2p acts in the late Golgi to maintain normal structure and function of this compartment . It is possible that Drs2p has some function in the endosome as well , or the effect on endosome function could be a secondary consequence of perturbing late Golgi function . Perhaps the most compelling evidence that Drs2p plays a role in clathrin function is the striking difference in the appearance of CCV preparations between drs2 (cid:68) and wild - type cells . Very few bona fide CCVs could be isolated from drs2 (cid:68) cells preincubated at the nonpermissive tem - perature . These preparations contained clathrin baskets and lattices with no associated membrane . In contrast , CCV preparations from drs2 (cid:68) cells maintained at 30 (cid:56) C were indistinguishable from wild - type samples . These re - sults suggest that Drs2p is required to form clathrin - coated vesicles from Golgi membranes at temperatures below 23 (cid:56) C . However , it is also possible that the association of clathrin coats with vesicle membranes from drs2 (cid:68) cells is less stable and the coat dissociates during cell lysis . In ei - ther case , loss of Drs2p clearly perturbs CCVs . At this time , it is not possible to distinguish whether the effect of Drs2p on clathrin function is direct or a second - ary consequence of the abnormal TGN structure . How - ever , this effect is specific since the TGN of drs2 (cid:68) cells on A p r il 16 , 2008 www . j c b . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 147 , 1999 1234 functions normally in the ability to sort vacuolar proteins and in protein secretion , despite the abnormal morphol - ogy . This suggests that late secretory vesicles bud normally from the TGN in drs2 (cid:68) cells . The genetic interactions also showed a high degree of specificity between drs2 (cid:68) and clathrin mutations . Therefore , there is not a wholesale loss of Golgi function in drs2 (cid:68) cells at the nonpermissive tem - perature . Indeed , most of the specific defects observed can be explained by a loss of clathrin function . Even the accu - mulation of abnormal membrane at the permissive tem - perature could be the result of inefficient CCV budding . The temperature - conditional defects observed for a strain carrying a complete loss of function allele is some - what unusual . This suggests that Drs2p is required to over - come an inherently cold - sensitive process in the cell ( per - haps CCV budding ) , such that the growth defect is caused by the combination of low temperature and loss of Drs2p . However , this cold - sensitive process is not at the extreme of the normal growth range for yeast ; drs2 (cid:68) cells fail to grow at room temperature ( 20 (cid:56) C ) and the mutant pheno - types described here are observed at this temperature . In addition , some of the drs2 (cid:68) phenotypes , such as arf1 (cid:68) syn - thetic lethality and abnormal Golgi morphology , are also observed at 30 (cid:56) C . Thus , it appears that Drs2p plays a role in Golgi function at all temperatures examined but is only essential below 23 (cid:56) C . Alternatively , it is possible that Drs2p function is essential at all temperatures , but loss of Drs2p is compensated by one or more of the Drs2p - related P - type ATPases at higher temperatures . In either case , Drs2p clearly plays a critical role for organisms such as yeast since the ability to adapt to daily fluctuations in temperature is essential for their survival . Potential Function of Drs2p as an Aminophospholipid Translocase What is the biochemical function of Drs2p ? Many P - type ATPases use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to pump cat - ions such as Ca 2 (cid:49) , H (cid:49) , Na (cid:49) , or heavy metals across a mem - brane against their electrochemical gradient . These trans - porting ATPases contain signature motifs that allowed the identification of 16 P - type ATPases in the yeast genome that can be phylogenetically grouped into six distinct fami - lies ( Catty et al . , 1997 ) . Four of the families correspond to the cation transporters just described , one family contains two ORFs of unknown function , and the last family are potential aminophospholipid transporters , which includes Drs2p and four other uncharacterized ORFs . Drs2p is 28 – 35 % identical to its four other yeast family members , but is 47 % identical to bovine or murine ATPase II from chromaffin granules ( FASTA comparisons ) , arguing that Drs2p and ATPase II are orthologues . The closest related P - type ATPases to the Drs2p family are the Ca 2 (cid:49) trans - porters ( 21 % identity between Drs2p and Pmc1p ) . How - ever , Drs2p and ATPase II are missing negatively charged amino acids in transmembrane domains 4 and 6 that are essential for cation transport and have hydrophobic resi - dues in their place . This is consistent with the proposed role of ATPase II and Drs2p in transporting aminophos - pholipids and makes it less likely that Drs2p transports cations . The drs2 (cid:68) mutant has been reported to exhibit a defect in the translocation of a fluorescent PS derivative across the plasma membrane ( Tang et al . , 1996 ) . However , Sieg - mund et al . ( 1998 ) have recently challenged this observa - tion and have failed to detect a difference between wild - type and drs2 (cid:68) cells in the translocation of fluorescent lipid derivatives across the plasma membrane . This group also found no difference in the amount of PE exposed on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane as detected by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid labeling . These latter obser - vations could suggest that Drs2p is not an aminophospho - lipid translocase , but it is more likely that the Drs2p pro - tein is simply not present at the plasma membrane and therefore is not required to maintain an asymmetric dis - tribution of aminophospholipids in this membrane . In fact , we cannot detect Drs2p at the plasma membrane by immunofluorescence localization or subcellular fraction - ation ( Figs . 7 and 8 ) . Measurement of translocase activity with Golgi membrane fractions is more complicated be - cause the direction of flip is expected to be from the lumi - nal to the cytoplasmic leaflet and thus requires incor - poration of the probe into the luminal leaflet . Thus , further work is required to determine if Drs2p is an ami - nophospholipid translocase , as suggested by its homology to ATPase II . Since an aminophospholipid translocase activity is the only biochemical function attributed to ATPase II and Drs2p in the literature , it is relevant to speculate on how membrane asymmetry may affect Golgi structure and perhaps clathrin function . The bilayer couple hypothesis of Sheetz and Singer ( 1974 ) proposes that asymmetric changes in the two leaflets of a bilayer should induce con - formational changes in the membrane . In fact , induced bi - layer asymmetry can cause conversion of spherical lipo - somes into tubular and interconnected vesicular structures ( Farge and Devaux , 1992 ) . In this regard , it is possible that changes in the asymmetric distribution of PS or PE could influence the formation of tubules or fenestrated regions of Golgi cisternae to produce a structure on which clathrin can assemble more productively . This is consistent with the morphological defect observed for Golgi membranes in the drs2 (cid:68) mutant , which are notable for their lack of fenestration or tubular regions . Particularly in comparison to the arf1 (cid:68) mutant in which the Golgi is highly fenes - trated or tubular in appearance ( Gaynor et al . , 1998 ) . Others have proposed that the transbilayer movement of lipid could induce the bending of membranes to facili - tate vesicle budding ( Devaux , 1991 ) . Zha et al . ( 1998 ) have reported that changes in the composition of the plasma membrane outer leaflet caused by sphingomyelinase treat - ment can induce an energy - independent budding of func - tional endocytic vesicles . In addition , Farge et al . ( 1999 ) have recently reported that exogenous PS incorporated into the external leaflet of the plasma membrane was pumped to the inner leaflet and markedly enhanced the level of bulk endocytosis . Thus , it is feasible that Drs2p actively participates in CCV budding from Golgi mem - branes , and becomes essential for this process as the tem - perature drops below a specific threshold where a de - creased fluidity of the membrane may prevent clathrin from performing this function alone . A third possibility is that an increase in the PE or PS concentration of the cytoplasmic leaflet may influence the on A p r il 16 , 2008 www . j c b . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Chen et al . Role for Drs2p in Late Golgi Function 1235 recruitment or activity of peripherally associated proteins . For example , the association of an ARF guanine nucle - otide exchange factor with Golgi membranes might be in - fluenced by the PS concentration ( Chardin et al . , 1996 ) . In addition , clathrin can be recruited on chemically defined liposomes , but requires an unusually high concentration of PE ( 40 % of total lipid ) to produce well - defined clathrin - coated buds on the membranes ( Takei et al . , 1998 ) . One might expect that an enzyme that pumps PE to the cyto - plasmic membrane could produce a high local concentra - tion of this lipid , particularly if the coat proteins restrict lateral diffusion of PE . Purification and reconstitution of Drs2p in chemically defined liposomes will help define the biochemical function of this protein and perhaps shed light on how Drs2p influences clathrin function in vivo .
