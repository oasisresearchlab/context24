A structural study ( Lam et al . , Nat . Comm . , 2018 ) 17 of the translocation domain of BoNT suggests that the interaction 18 with the membrane is driven by the transition of an α helical switch 19 towards a β hairpin . Atomistic simulations in conjunction with the 20 mesoscopic Twister model are used to investigate the consequences of 21 this proposition for the toxin - membrane interaction . The conforma - 22 tional mobilities of the domain as well as the effect of the membrane , 23 implicitly examined by comparing water and water - ethanol solvents , 24 lead to the conclusion that the transition of the switch modifies the 25 internal dynamics and the effect of membrane hydrophobicity on the 26 whole protein . The central two α helices , helix 1 and helix 2 , form - 27 ing two coiled - coil motifs , are analyzed using the Twister model , in 28 which the initial deformation of the membrane by the protein is caused 29 by the presence of local torques arising from asymmetric positions of 30 hydrophobic residues . Different torque distributions are observed de - 31 pending on the switch conformations and permit to propose an origin 32 for the mechanism opening the membrane . 33 1 Keywords 34 Clostridium botulinum ; botulinum toxin ; molecular dynamics ; residue 35 protonation ; mesoscopic Twister model ; hydrophobicity ; water - ethanol 36 1 solvent 37 2 Introduction 38 Botulinum neurotoxins ( BoNTs ) , secreted by Clostrodium botulinum , 39 are among the most powerful toxic compounds found in nature , pro - 40 voking flaccid paralysis of the host [ 1 ] . BoNTs are traditionally clas - 41 sified into several serotypes , termed A – G [ 2 ] and X [ 3 ] . Among them , 42 BoNT of type A1 is the most - used BoNT in medical applications [ 4 ] . 43 The toxins are formed by two protein chains connected by one 44 disulfide bridge : the light chain ( LC ) and the heavy chain ( HC ) . The 45 role of HC is to prepare the delivery of the catalytic region LC which 46 is responsible for the toxicity of BoNT . HC includes an N - terminal 47 translocation domain ( H N ) ( ≃ 50 kDa ) responsible for the LC delivery 48 into the cytosol and a C - terminal domain ( H C ) ( ≃ 50 kDa ) which rec - 49 ognizes specific receptors located at the terminal button of motoneu - 50 rons . It is generally assumed that the two chains connected by one 51 disulfide bridge are sufficient for producing the toxin’s physiological 52 activity in neuromotors . 53 Starting from several conformations observed for BoNT / A1 [ 5 ] and 54 BoNT / E1 [ 6 ] with various protonation schemes depending on physio - 55 logical pH values of 4 . 7 and 7 , a recent molecular modeling study [ 7 ] 56 revealed that the global conformational variability of the toxin mainly 57 depends on the relative displacements of the toxin domains . In addi - 58 tion , the analysis of the relative accessible surfaces according to pH 59 variations , pointed to the translocation domain as one of the hotspots 60 for the interaction between membrane and toxin in accordance to pre - 61 vious models [ 1 ] . 62 The structures of the isolated translocation domain of BoNT / A1 63 [ 8 ] were determined experimentally ( Fig 1A ) at two pH values : 5 . 1 and 64 8 . 5 , which are close to the physiological pH values ( acidic and neutral ) 65 regulating the function of BoNT . For the acidic pH value , a dimer of 66 two translocation domains was observed ( PDB entry : 6DKK ) , whereas 67 the other structure ( PDB entry : 6MHJ ) was monomeric and quite 68 similar to the structure observed within complete toxin structures . In 69 the dimeric structure , the switch domain ( residues 620 - 666 in 6MHJ ) 70 undergoes a transition from an α - helix bundle to a β strand . The 71 monomer β strands interact with each other , producing a larger β 72 strand which stabilizes the inter - monomer interaction . Lam et al . [ 8 ] 73 2 concluded from their observations that the dimerization is not rele - 74 vant for BoNT / A1 function in vivo but that the acidification of the 75 inner part of the neurotransmitter vesicle will induce a conformational 76 change of the switch favoring the interaction of the translocation do - 77 main with the membrane . 78 The present work intends to investigate the internal dynamics of 79 the translocation domain in water and in a mixture of water and 80 ethanol with the help of atomistic molecular dynamics ( MD ) simu - 81 lations on the hundred of nanosecond time scale . Ethanol has been 82 chosen as co - solvent for the following reasons . As the OH group of 83 ethanol is inherently polar , while the CH3 group of its short carbon 84 chain exhibits hydrophobic characteristics , ethanol has the ability to 85 engage with proteins through both hydrophilic and hydrophobic in - 86 teractions . In this context , ethanol has frequently been regarded as a 87 model for investigating the equilibrium between hydrophobic interac - 88 tions and hydrogen bonds . Last but most important for the present 89 study , ethanol water solutions are usually exploited to mimic the en - 90 vironment of cell membranes and in particular the membrane - water 91 interface [ 9 , 10 ] , providing access to a diversity of conformations for 92 membrane proteins . A 50 - 50 water - ethanol ratio is a good compromise 93 to set the ethanol content high enough to force a protein to expose its 94 hydrophobic segments [ 11 ] while preventing the aggregation of ethanol 95 molecules , which may impede the weakening of the hydrophobic pro - 96 tein core [ 12 , 13 , 14 ] . 97 The starting points of the molecular dynamics trajectories will be 98 provided by the X - ray crystallographic structures determined by Lam 99 et al . [ 8 ] using monomeric conformations . Moreover , we will discuss 100 how the protein can deform the membrane after making close contact 101 using a biophysical model . In the past , such models have successfully 102 explained the formation of lipid membrane rafts [ 15 , 16 ] , interface - 103 mediated interactions between membrane - bound particles leading to 104 endo - / exocytosis [ 17 ] or the formation of membrane channels [ 18 ] . To 105 understand how an object containing hydrophobic and hydrophilic 106 parts such as a biofilament or a protein domain can interact with a 107 membrane , mesoscopic models are of particular interest . A combina - 108 tion of elasticity theory and geometry helps to describe the various 109 system configurations . Within this framework , two mechanisms have 110 been proposed which can induce the deformation of a membrane due 111 to an object : the Twister and the Darboux torque mechanism [ 19 ] . 112 Since then , the Darboux torque mechanism has been found to explain 113 3 membrane deformation by FtzsZ [ 20 ] and by ESCRT - III [ 21 , 22 ] or 114 membrane fission by dynamin [ 23 ] . To the best of our knowledge the 115 Twister mechanism was not put in evidence for explaining biological 116 interactions with the membrane and we will explore its applicability 117 in the framework of the BoNT - membrane interaction . 118 The originality of the work not only lies in the possible emer - 119 gence of the Twister mechanism but also in the implicit modeling of 120 the membrane in the simulation . This choice was motivated by the 121 hypothesis that the inertia of membrane atomistic or coarse - grained 122 systems considerably slows down the events related to the interaction 123 between protein and membrane . The use of a mixed solvent mimick - 124 ing the hydrophobic interactions produced by the membrane allows to 125 confirm the model of anchoring of the hairpin in the membrane . The 126 final aim of the present work is to obtain information on the protein’s 127 conformational changes at the molecular level , in particular during 128 the interaction with the vesicle membrane , in order to propose mech - 129 anistic hypotheses for the translocation of the full toxin through this 130 membrane . 131 3 Results 132 In this section , we present the results obtained from the protein’s 133 structure and dynamics along the MD trajectories recorded in water 134 and in a 50 - 50 water - ethanol mixture . We start with an analysis of 135 the internal mobility of the domain , followed by a presentation of the 136 distribution of the solvent molecules . In a final step the Twister model 137 is applied on the helices 1 and 2 . 138 In the following , we selected values of 4 . 7 and 7 for acidic and neu - 139 tral conditions , respectively , although the structures 6MHJ and 6DKK 140 were determined at pH values of 8 . 5 and 5 . 1 . These values were also 141 those selected to mimic the acidic and neutral conditions inside the 142 vesicles , in our previous full length BoNT MD study [ 7 ] as this allows 143 to directly compare the behaviors of the translocation domain and of 144 the full - length proteins . As in the present study the pH effect is mod - 145 eled through different protonation patterns among protein residues , 146 we checked , the differences in protein protonation for pH 4 . 7 vs 5 . 1 147 and pH 7 vs . 8 . 5 using H + + , a method for pK a calculations based 148 on a continuum electrostatic model [ 24 , 25 ] ( Table 2 ) . The follow - 149 ing protonated residues are predicted at acidic pH : glutamic ( GLU ) 150 4 and aspartic ( ASP ) acids , both protonated on the sidechain carboxyl 151 group . The protonation of one histidine is predicted at pH 8 . 5 . At pH 152 of 4 . 7 , eight residues are detected in 6MHJ , and six in 6DKK . Among 153 them , four residues are located in the switch , one residue in the switch 154 tail and one residue ( GLU - 809 ) in the helix 2 . The three residues 155 GLU - 620 , GLU - 809 and ASP - 848 are protonated in both structures , 156 and for the two pH values 4 . 7 and 5 . 1 . The protonation at pH = 7 or 157 8 . 5 are quite equivalent for both 6DKK and 6MHJ . As for acidic pHs , 158 there is a slight similar variation in the protonation between 6DKK 159 and 6MHJ , as few more residues are protonated at pH 4 . 7 with respect 160 to 5 . 1 . 161 3 . 1 Internal mobility of the translocation do - 162 main 163 The Root Mean Square Deviation ( RMSD ) between atomic coordi - 164 nates of conformations is utilized to get global information on tertiary 165 rearrangements in the protein with time . Atomic Root Mean Square 166 Fluctuations ( RMSF ) are analyzed to investigate local motions in dis - 167 tinct protein regions , while the radius of a cylinder encompassing the 168 protein structure is monitored to complement global structural results . 169 The combined analysis of RMSD , RMSF and cylinder radius provides 170 useful insights for tertiary modifications in different conformational 171 and protonation states . The RMSD values were calculated from the 172 atomic coordinates of the initial frame of the simulation , obtained 173 from the PDB structure . The RMSF have then been calculated with 174 respect to the average conformation along the trajectories ( Table S1 ) . 175 The coordinate RMSD for the backbone’s heavy atoms along the 176 MD trajectories in water ( Fig 2 , left panels ) display different be - 177 haviours for trajectories starting from the momomer ( 6MHJ ) com - 178 pared to a monomer extracted from the dimer ( 6DKK ) . The monomeric 179 structure 6MHJ stays stable with a RMSD plateau around 3 ˚A , at - 180 tained after 50 ns of trajectory , whereas the monomer extracted from 181 the dimer structure 6DKK exhibits more heterogeneous RMSD pro - 182 files along the trajectories with plateaus lying between 4 and 8 ˚A . 183 For a given starting structure and a given solvent , the variation of 184 the protonation does not induce different trends in RMSD variations . 185 However , comparing the global RMSD values for different solvents , 186 the values observed for 6MHJ in water - ethanol increase slightly with 187 respect to the situation in water ( Fig 2 , upper four panels ) whereas 188 5 the values obtained for 6DKK are reduced ( Fig 2 , lower four panels ) . 189 The water - ethanol mixture thus seems to produce opposite effects on 190 the two conformations . 191 These differences observed for the water - ethanol mixture may be 192 put in relation with the physiological effect of pH on the protein , as 193 the two starting conformations were experimentally determined at dif - 194 ferent pH values . On the one hand , the structure 6DKK was obtained 195 at acidic pH corresponding to the physiological conditions during the 196 toxin’s interaction with the membrane of the synaptic vesicle . Since 197 the water - ethanol mixture intends to mimic the hydrophobic effect 198 of the membrane , it is interesting to see that the coordinate RMSD 199 is reduced in the mixture with respect to the observations in wa - 200 ter . On the other hand , the structure 6MHJ was observed at neutral 201 pH , corresponding to physiological conditions of non - interaction with 202 the membrane . Therefore , it is not surprising that the water - ethanol 203 mixture induces a slightly larger drift of coordinates than the water 204 solvent . 205 Coordinate RMSD calculated for the helices 1 and 2 , as well as for 206 the switch , are displayed as boxplots ( Fig S1 ) . The helix RMSD are 207 mostly located in the 1 - 2 ˚A range , in agreement to the conservation 208 of the secondary structure of the α helices . Nevertheless , the RMSD 209 values for some 6MHJ replicas are larger than 2 ˚A in the water - ethanol 210 mixture . In particular , the 6MHJ α helices exhibit RMSD values in 211 the solvent mixture , which are slightly larger than the ones observed 212 in water , especially for helix 2 . The hydrophobic field produced by the 213 mixed solvent thus seems to have a destabilizing effect on the struc - 214 ture 6MHJ . This agrees with the assignment of the structure 6MHJ 215 to the state of the translocation domain in solution . The destabiliza - 216 tion propagates also to the switch for one 6MHJ trajectory at pH 7 217 in water - ethanol solvent ( see the orange box at the bottom right of 218 Fig S1 ) . But , almost no effect of the pH is observed in the helices of 219 6DKK , both in water and in ethanol - water mixture . This agrees with 220 the observation of Ref . [ 26 ] according to which the secondary structure 221 of the helices does not change with the pH . 222 In contrast to helices 1 and 2 , large RMSD values are observed 223 for the switch in most of the trajectories recorded for 6DKK . These 224 values are larger ( in the 5 - 8 ˚A range ) in water than in the water - 225 ethanol mixture ( 3 - 6 ˚A range ) . This dispersion recalls the large RMSD 226 drifts observed for 6DKK in water ( Fig 2 ) , elucidating that the global 227 conformational drift of the translocation domain is mostly due to the 228 6 switch region . 229 The atomic root - mean - square fluctuation ( RMSF ) profiles ( Fig 3 ) 230 display a large peak located in the region of residues 620 - 660 corre - 231 sponding to the switch . This peak is much smaller for 6MHJ than 232 for 6DKK . Several smaller peaks are observed in the N terminal re - 233 gion , as well as in the loops connecting the helices 1 and 2 and the 234 remaining part of the structure . For some trajectories of 6MHJ , a 235 reduction of the pH in water induces the appearance of larger peaks 236 in the switch as well as in the N terminal region ( upper left panel of 237 Fig 3 ) . This gives a hint about the initial transition steps of 6MHJ 238 towards the 6DKK conformation under acidic pH . Large RMSF peaks 239 are also observed for the C terminal α helix . Looking at the conforma - 240 tional changes in the last frame of the trajectories , the C terminal α 241 helix , undergoes unfolding in the trajectories labeled with ’u’ ( Fig S2 ) , 242 populating conformations similar to those observed in the equivalent 243 region of the X - ray crystallographic structure of BoNT / E1 [ 6 ] . In 244 other trajectories labeled ’s’ ( Fig S2 ) , the C terminal α helix swings : 245 in the full toxin , this motion would push the receptor binding domain 246 further away from the translocation domain . This separation of the 247 translocation and the receptor binding domains has been observed to 248 a more limited extent during the MD simulations recorded on the full 249 toxins [ 7 ] . 250 As it is visible for the conformations displayed in Fig S2 , the switch 251 shows various orientations with respect to the remaining part of the 252 domain . In order to get a finer picture of the switch positions , the 253 geometry of the protein conformation was modelled as a cylinder as 254 described in Section 5 . 3 . The time behaviour of the cylinder radius 255 ( Fig 4 ) parallels the one of the global RMSD ( Fig 2 ) . The radius is 256 quite stable around 14 ˚A for all trajectories recorded on 6MHJ ( four 257 top panels of Fig 4 ) . Interestingly , the trajectories display a slight drift 258 at acidic pH ( top left panel , green curve ) as well as in the water - ethanol 259 mixture , at all pH values . For 6DKK , very heterogeneous profiles are 260 observed for the radius with values in the range of 14 . 5 - 19 ˚A ( four 261 bottom panels of Fig 4 ) . Most of the profiles display a decrease in the 262 radius values in water along the trajectory time ( bottom left panels ) . 263 By contrast , the use of the water - ethanol mixture prevents the radius 264 to decrease ( bottom right panels ) . Indeed , the cylinder radius fluc - 265 tuates around 18 ˚A , which is the initial radius value arising from the 266 protruding hairpin observed in the PBD entry . This suggests that , in 267 contrast to water , the hairpin keeps protruding from the structure in 268 7 the water - ethanol mixture , as can be confirmed by visual inspection 269 of the final system snapshots along the trajectories ( Fig S2 ) . 270 Based on all variations observed along the trajectories in water , 271 the strong conformational drift in 6DKK ( Fig 2 ) can be attributed 272 to a variation of the conformation of the switch , due to a tendency 273 to fold onto the remaining part of the translocation domain ( Fig S2 ) . 274 Interestingly , the effect is weaker at acidic pH ( see conformations in the 275 upper left panel for 6DKK in Fig S2 ) . This folding is due to the large 276 hydrophobic patch present on the switch , which favors the interactions 277 with other hydrophobic patches on the surface of the translocation 278 domain ( Fig 1B ) . The drift agrees with the importance of the dimer 279 interface to stabilize the protruding conformation of the switch in the 280 6DKK structure and confirms that the conformation of isolated 6DKK 281 is probably not relevant in water . At the contrary , in the water - 282 ethanol mixture , the hydrophobic field arising from the presence of 283 ethanol permits to keep the extended conformations and to support 284 the model of membrane interaction proposed in Ref . [ 8 ] . 285 3 . 2 Distribution of ethanol and water molecules 286 around the translocation domain 287 To get insight in the solvent partition close to the protein , the average 288 Spatial Density Functions ( SDF ) around the two protein structures 289 in the water - ethanol mixture are calculated and the results shown in 290 Fig 5 . 291 Overall , the protein is preferentially hydrated . However , ethanol 292 molecules are able to establish interactions with the protein , replacing 293 water . When the solute largely fluctuates , the resulting SDF of the 294 solvent molecules is averaged to zero . For this reason , the protrud - 295 ing switch conformation in 6DKK displays paradoxically no persistent 296 interaction with ethanol molecules ( Fig 5 , bottom row ) . The pH acid - 297 ification induces a larger number of ethanol molecules to localize in 298 the central region . This agrees with the tendency of the translocation 299 domain to interact with the membrane at the same pH range . Pref - 300 erential ethanol solvation is , however , more pronounced in the central 301 region of 6MHJ ( Fig 5 , upper row ) than of 6DKK . 302 In Fig S3 a more detailed comparison of the solvent distributions at 303 the two pH values is shown for 6MHJ only . Preferential ethanol solva - 304 tion is observed in particular around stretches of hydrophobic residues 305 present in the switch tail and the C terminal tail ( Table 1 ) , and high - 306 8 lighted in dark grey surface representation . The switch tail , located 307 at the C terminal of the switch , corresponds to the very hydrophobic 308 primary sequence ILLEFIPEIAIPVLG , whereas the primary sequence 309 STDIPFQLSKYV of the C terminal tail is less hydrophobic . It is in - 310 teresting to note that in the protein structure , the switch tail is closer 311 to the protruding switch and possibly to the membrane than the C 312 terminal tail . The persistent ethanol molecules observed close to the 313 tail regions support a model of protein - membrane interaction in which 314 the tails will be solubilized early during the process . 315 This solubilization together with the mobility and unfolding ten - 316 dency of the C terminal α helix ( Fig S2 ) and the mobility peaks in 317 several RMSF profiles for the N terminal domain ( Fig 3 ) suggests 318 that the bundle formed by the two helices 1 and 2 will constitute the 319 remaining piece of the folded structure involved in the interaction be - 320 tween the membrane and the translocation domain . This interaction 321 will be analyzed in the following with the help of the Twister model . 322 3 . 3 Twister model as a possible route for open - 323 ing the vesicle membrane 324 To apply a local force or torque distribution on a membrane and conse - 325 quently induce a deformation , forces and torques have to be balanced 326 globally at equilibrium . For a straight filament the Twister model 327 suggests that a mismatch between the filament’s internal twist and 328 the hydrophobic regions of the membrane leads to a local torque [ 19 ] . 329 The simplest case which cancels the total torque consists of two an - 330 tiparallel point torques ( called the Twister in the limit of vanishing 331 distance between the two torques ) . In the following we will study 332 whether this model is also relevant for the case of the helices 1 and 2 333 in the BoNT translocation domain . 334 For applying the Twister model , we need to be sure that the α 335 helix structures are stabilized at least for the first steps of the interac - 336 tion with the membrane . This stability is induced by the interaction 337 between the upper and lower halves of the helices observed in the X - 338 ray crystallographic structures ( Fig 1A ) . To support this point , the 339 residues of the regions in contact , 695 - 713 / 801 - 819 and 730 - 748 / 766 - 340 784 , extracted from the PDB entries 6MHJ and 6DKK , were pro - 341 cessed using the software CCCP ( Coiled - coil Crick Parameterization ) 342 [ 27 ] , available at the Web server : www . grigoryanlab . org / cccp . This 343 analysis ( Table S2 ) shows that the regions in contact display coiled - coil 344 9 structural motifs , stabilizing the helix conformations and consequently 345 preserving the predefined asymmetry in the positions of hydrophobic 346 residues . The presence of these coiled - coil motifs will indeed permit 347 the application of local torques during the helix / membrane interac - 348 tion . 349 An analysis of the torques ˜ T kl , introduced in Sec . 5 . 4 , shows that 350 the distribution of the hydrophobic residues along the helices 1 and 351 2 can induce local torques of mostly alternating sign , reminiscent of 352 Twister - like interactions ( see Figs . 6 and S4 , S5 , S6 , S7 , S8 ) . The 353 configurations of the helices are stable , which is visible in the coordi - 354 nates RMSD smaller than 2 ˚A , displayed in Fig S1 and reflected by 355 the tiny standard deviations of ˜ T kl . The only exception is observed 356 for a residue located in the middle of helix 1 , ALA - 719 , which is in 357 close spatial proximity to the switch . 358 In order to investigate more deeply the configuration of the helices , 359 we have used the visualisation processing Bendix proposed for protein 360 α helices [ 28 ] . This processing provides additional information for the 361 helix coarse - graining : first , it shows that a representation as elastic 362 tubes is applicable and second , it allows to calculate the local bending 363 angles along these tubes . The bending angles along the helices 1 and 364 2 ( Figs 7 , S9 and S10 ) display similar profiles in all conditions . The 365 profiles are almost superimposed for helix 1 , whereas small variations 366 with pH and type of solvent are observed for helix 2 . A greater sensi - 367 tivity to the variation of conditions had already been shown for helix 2 368 in 6MHJ in the subdomain RMSD ( Fig S1 ) . The large peaks observed 369 at the middle of the profiles denote a singularity in the definition of 370 the helix axis , implying a kink . This again suggests to consider two 371 parts of each helix separately in agreement to the previous coiled - coil 372 analysis . We propose thus to define four helix parts : H11 , H12 for 373 helix 1 and H21 , H22 for helix 2 , with the residues ranges given in 374 Table 1 ( see also Fig . 1A ) . 375 We should first stress that the present study intends to predict the 376 behavior of the protein at the approach to the water - membrane inter - 377 face [ 10 ] based on an in silico analysis of the protein conformations 378 in solution . In this system , the helices 1 and 2 display long - range in - 379 teractions with the other parts of the protein structure , which makes 380 the analysis of the hydrophobic interactions very complex . It is thus 381 not simple to draw a conclusion about the global equilibrium of the 382 torques , in particular since the membrane is not present explicitly . 383 Nevertheless , we can calculate a total torque acting on each helix part 384 10 assuming that each part can be modeled as a cylindrical tube . This 385 model is valid in the first approximation since the local bending angle 386 is small within each part ( see again Fig . 7 ) . We additionally make the 387 ( very strong ) assumption that the helix bundle at first makes contact 388 with the membrane in the middle between the helix parts , close to the 389 protruding switch . This assumption is supported by the mutagenesis 390 done by Lam et al [ 8 ] . This implies that the hydrophobic residues at 391 the boundary of each helix part ( bold italic in Table S3 ) are the ones 392 which enter the membrane first , thereby defining the direction of the 393 resulting hydrophobic strip on the helices . The total torque is thus 394 obtained by summing up the local torques ˜ T kl along each region H11 , 395 H12 , H21 and H22 , relative to these residues . 396 The resulting total torques fluctuate only marginally around a con - 397 stant value along the trajectory time ( Figs 8 and S11 , S12 ) . The 398 type of solvent does not induce much variations in the torque values . 399 Changing the protonation scheme slightly shifts the value for H22 , 400 since one additional residue ( GLU - 809 ) gets protonated at pH = 4 . 7 . 401 The largest difference is observed between 6MHJ and 6DKK struc - 402 tures : the value for H22 is negative and close to zero for 6MHJ and 403 positive for 6DKK . Due to the existence of the coiled - coil motifs we 404 assume a direct interaction of the region H11 with H22 and of the 405 region H12 with H21 , respectively . For the local torques to act on the 406 membrane , the global torque has to vanish . This is approximately the 407 case for the conformation 6DKK at pH = 4 . 7 , for both coiled - coil mo - 408 tifs . Interestingly , this is the structure obtained at conditions ( acidic 409 pH and protruding switch ) pointed out [ 8 ] as characteristic for the 410 interaction with the membrane . 411 The opposite torque values suggest a mechanism in which the he - 412 lix halves in direct interaction via the coiled - coil motifs ( H11 / H22 413 and H12 / H21 , respectively ) undergo opposite torques . These global 414 torques could induce additional rotations of each helix with respect to 415 the other , inducing the hydrophobic residues involved in the coiled - coil 416 interactions to insert between the lipid tails of the membrane . 417 In the structures of the translocation domain studied here , the 418 helices 1 and 2 are surrounded by the N terminal domain , the switch 419 domain , the C terminal α helix and the tails connecting the switch 420 and the helix 1 and connecting the helix 2 to the C terminal helix 421 ( Table 1 ) . From the previous analyses ( Fig S2 ) , the C terminal helix 422 displays a tendency to unfold . In addition , sites of ethanol binding 423 are observed on the tails ( Fig S3 ) . Moreover , Lam et al . proposed 424 11 that the β hairpin switch anchors the protein to the membrane [ 8 ] . 425 Putting all that together , it is quite probable that , at a certain stage of 426 the membrane interaction , the helices 1 and 2 correspond to the last 427 folded part of the translocation domain . At that stage , the torque 428 profile plays thus an essential role for predicting the conformational 429 transition of the two coupled tubes in the membrane . 430 4 Discussion 431 In this work the conformational dynamics of the BoNT translocation 432 domain was investigated by molecular dynamics simulations . Two dif - 433 ferent experimental structures have been employed as starting points 434 of the simulations , performed at acidic and neutral pH values . The 435 protein - membrane interaction was implicitly taken into account by 436 using a water - ethanol mixture to mimic a hydrophobic environment . 437 The ethanol displays a polarity of 0 . 6 on a scale where water is at 438 1 , and hexane at 0 [ 29 ] . Ethanol is formed of a polar group ( OH ) 439 and of a hydrophobic tail ( ethane ) displaying some similarity with 440 the lipid molecules , formed of a polar head and a tail . In the view 441 of the authors , the water - ethanol mixture provides a numerical trick 442 for testing the hydrophobic interactions of the protein as the ethanol 443 molecules are smaller than the lipids and can interact more freely with 444 the protein surface . The reliability of water - ethanol for mimicking the 445 effect of the membrane is supported by the behavior of the switch in 446 the water - ethanol mixture . In contrast to the observations in aqueous 447 solution , the switch was indeed shown to keep its protruding position 448 in mixed solvent . This also confirms that the protruding conformation 449 is probably the one selected in establishing the first interaction with 450 the membrane . 451 The present work may also be valuable in the frame of enhanced 452 sampling approaches [ 30 , 31 ] , as a key step in these methods is the 453 choice of collective variables , defining the coordinate of reaction for the 454 exploration of the conformational space of biological systems . In the 455 case of soluble proteins undergoing translocation across the membrane , 456 this choice is very delicate as the distribution of hydrophobic residues 457 on the protein surface cannot give an indication , in contrast to the 458 transmembrane proteins . The procedure described in this work could 459 provide information for the choice of such collective variables . One 460 possible choice would be the angles between the axes of H11 and H12 461 12 and between the axes of H21 and H22 to drive rotation around the 462 pivot , and rotation of each of these helix moities around their own axis 463 to favor the exposure of hydrophobic residues . It is worth noting that 464 the use of a model issued from the soft matter field allowed to shine a 465 new light on this problem . We took advantage of the mesoscopic model 466 of filament interactions [ 19 ] to mimic the cooperative effect of the 467 numerous lipids present in an ordered way in the membrane . Indeed , 468 the torque produced by the asymmetry of the positions of hydrophobic 469 residues in the protein can only be active in the presence of a formed 470 membrane , stabilized by the cooperativity of the interactions between 471 lipids . 472 Based on the conformations explored at the atomistic level , the 473 concomitant interaction between the coiled - coil helices and the mem - 474 brane was investigated in the frame of the mesoscopic Twister model , 475 which permits to calculate the torques underlying the membrane - 476 protein interaction , required for membrane opening . The introduction 477 of this model is the most innovative point of the work presented here . 478 Its novelty lies in the connection established between conformations 479 at atomic resolution and the mesoscopic scale . A possible extension 480 would be to use an adapted scale of hydrophobicity for the amino - acid 481 residues . Various scales could be exploited in that respect [ 32 , 33 ] . 482 Nevertheless , the present state of the model only allows for a quali - 483 tative description of protein - membrane interaction . A description at 484 atomic resolution of this interaction would require the development of 485 a related energy function . Moreover , while a lipid - protein complex re - 486 lies on relatively localized interactions , in principle the ethanol - protein 487 interaction would take place via diffuse contacts . However , the analy - 488 sis of the ethanol distribution around the structure 6DKK at pH 4 . 7 489 revealed some strong preferred localisation of ethanol methyl groups 490 close to the center of the translocation domain ( large green spots in 491 Fig . 5 , lower right panel ) . Knowing that the switch , located at the 492 center of the domain as well , has also some preference for insertion 493 into the membrane , these two pieces of information permit to infer a 494 local pivot point for applying the torques arising from the asymmetry 495 in the positions of the hydrophobic residues . 496 The implication of coiled - coil motifs in this study is not surprising , 497 since these motifs are known to play a role in many other structures 498 interacting with membranes such as in the SNARE complex [ 34 ] . In 499 addition , successful examples in the design of membrane systems used 500 coiled - coil motifs as a starting point . For example , rational de novo 501 13 design of channels was possible based on α HB coiled - coil peptides [ 35 ] . 502 Moreover , a liposomal fusion model system was developed [ 36 ] using 503 a set of hetero - dimeric coiled - coil peptide pairs . 504 The Twister analysis of the torques along the helix tubes permits 505 to propose a model in which local torques induce membrane defor - 506 mations . The resulting global opposite torques within the coiled - coil 507 motifs of helices 1 and 2 additionally imply a rotation of the motif H11 508 with respect to H22 and of H12 with H21 , respectively . The middle re - 509 gions of helices 1 and 2 were not included in the torque analysis , since 510 they were not part of a coiled - coil motif . As these regions are close to 511 the β hairpin switch , their unfolding could , however , permit a reor - 512 ganisation of the four helix motifs , potentially inducing the formation 513 of a pore in the membrane . Interestingly , the beltless translocation 514 domain of botulinum toxin A was shown to be able to act as a conduc - 515 tive channel [ 37 ] , reminiscent of the design experiments on coiled - coil 516 motifs [ 35 , 36 ] . 517 The analysis of the trajectories at various pH values and in po - 518 lar and more hydrophobic solvents allows to propose hypotheses on 519 the interactions between the whole botulinum toxin ( BoNT ) and the 520 membrane of neurotransmitter vesicles . Firstly , upon acidification the 521 translocation domain adopts a conformation with protruding hairpin 522 to initiate the interaction with the membrane . Secondly , the unfold - 523 ing of the C - terminal α helix agrees with the observations made on 524 the BoNT / E1 structure [ 6 ] : the C - terminal α helix ( residues 821 - 845 525 in BoNT / E1 ) of the translocation domain unfolds and displays loop 526 conformations . The translocation domain behaves thus relatively in - 527 dependently from the remaining BoNT structure , in agreement with 528 the modularity previously observed between various regions of BoNT 529 [ 7 ] . The most stable sub - structures of the translocation domain are 530 the coiled - coil motifs formed between helices 1 and 2 ; these motifs 531 apply torques opening the membrane , possibly inducing a pore for - 532 mation . Several models of the subsequent passage of the catalytic 533 domain of BoNT have been proposed [ 38 ] . An investigation of the ac - 534 tual translocation mechanism is out of the scope of the present study . 535 In summary , this study represents a first step of coupling the meso - 536 scopic Twister model to an atomistic approach with predictive power 537 for protein - membrane interactions . The concomitant use of the two 538 approaches allowed to define a hierarchy in the interactions between 539 the translocation domain and the membrane . This hierarchy proposes 540 a division of the protein structure in regions undergoing unfolding or 541 14 separation from the protein core , and the bundle of helices 1 and 2 542 as the main player involved in membrane insertion . Our predictions 543 are of particular interest in the case of soluble proteins displaying 544 conformational changes during their insertion in the membrane . As 545 structural biology techniques often have difficulties to capture these 546 changes due to the dynamics of the process , the model described here 547 might provide low resolution information which can be probed exper - 548 imentally or combined with high resolution structures . 549 5 Materials and Methods 550 5 . 1 Preparation of the starting conformations 551 of toxins 552 The monomeric ( 6MHJ ) and dimeric ( 6DKK ) structures of the translo - 553 cation domain [ 8 ] have been downloaded from the Protein Data Bank 554 www . rcsb . org . In 6MHJ , the residue F658 has been modified into 555 E658 , in order to fit to the WT sequence of BoNT / A1 . In 6DKK , 556 the chain B has been extracted as a monomer , as it was containing 557 the smallest number of missing residues at the C terminal extremity 558 of the protein . As already mentioned in the introduction , a 6DKK 559 monomer was studied by molecular dynamics as the dimer was shown 560 [ 8 ] to be induced by crystallogenesis . 561 The studied systems were named ( Table S1 ) using the PDB entry 562 name ( 6MHJ / 6DKK ) , the pH for which the protonation was defined 563 ( 47 or 70 ) and the solvent name ( W for TIP3P and E for water - 564 ethanol ) . The names of these systems will also be the names of the 565 corresponding trajectories . 566 5 . 2 Molecular dynamics simulations 567 For each previously described system , the protein was embedded in 568 a water box ( Table S1 ) , and counterions were added to neutralize 569 the net system charge . The total number of atoms varies between 570 97483 and 189355 ( Table S1 ) . All molecular dynamics ( MD ) simu - 571 lations were performed using NAMD 2 . 13 [ 39 ] and NAMD 3 . 0 [ 40 ] 572 depending on the type of machine architecture . The CHARMM36 573 force field [ 41 ] for the protein and the TIP3P model for the water 574 molecules [ 42 ] were used . A cutoff of 12 ˚A and a switching distance 575 15 of 10 ˚A was employed for non - bonded interactions , while long - range 576 electrostatic interactions were calculated with the Particle Mesh Ewald 577 ( PME ) method [ 43 ] . Before starting each MD trajectory , the system 578 was minimized for 20000 steps , then heated up gradually from 0 to 579 310 K in 31000 integration steps . Finally , the system was equilibrated 580 for 500 . 000 steps in the NVT ensemble at 310 K , yielding a trajec - 581 tory of 1 ns . In these first three stages , all carbon α ( C α ) atoms were 582 kept fixed . Simulations were then performed in the NPT ensemble , 583 ( P = 1 bar , T = 310 K ) , with all atoms free to move . During the 584 equilibration and production trajectories , the non - iterative Settle al - 585 gorithm [ 44 , 45 ] was used to keep rigid all covalent bonds involving 586 hydrogen atoms , enabling a time step of 2 fs . Atomic coordinates 587 were saved every 20 ps . 500 ns of production were recorded and each 588 trajectory was triplicated for a cumulative trajectory duration of 1 . 5 589 µ s . 590 The 50 / 50 mixed water - ethanol systems were prepared in the fol - 591 lowing way . The software PACKMOL [ 46 ] was run to generate boxes of 592 water and ethanol molecules , with the same number of each molecule 593 type ( water - ethanol box in Table S1 ) . This box was then minimized , 594 thermalized and equilibrated for 1 ns using the same protocol as the 595 one described above for the protein in water . The final frame was then 596 superimposed to the protein’s initial conformations solvated in a wa - 597 ter box , and each water or ethanol molecule located at less than 2 . 4 ˚A 598 from the protein atoms was discarded from the system . The NAMD 599 coordinate and topology input files were generated and the minimiza - 600 tion , thermalization , equilibration and production protocol described 601 above was used to simulate the protein - ethanol - water systems . 200 ns 602 of production were recorded and each trajectory was triplicated for a 603 cumulative trajectory duration of 0 . 6 µ s . For the trajectories recorded 604 on 6DKK , roto - translational motions of the protein were harmonically 605 restrained throughout the simulation ( with a scaled force constant of 606 30 kcal / mol ) using the colvar commands [ 47 ] , to avoid any rigid - body 607 motion of the protein but leaving unaltered the internal dynamics . 608 5 . 3 Analysis of the atomistic trajectories 609 The analysis of protein conformations sampled along MD trajectories 610 was realized using ccptraj [ 48 ] and the python package MDAnalysis 611 [ 49 , 50 ] . The bending angles of helices 1 and 2 ( Fig . 1A ) in H N were 612 determined using the VMD plugin Bendix [ 28 ] on every 10 frames of 613 16 the trajectory . 614 Due to the elongated structure of the translocation domain , the 615 whole shape of the domain was analyzed using a model based on a 616 cylinder . Using the MDAnalysis library [ 50 ] , the moments of inertia 617 and principal axes were calculated from the positions of the C α atoms , 618 on every 10 frames of the trajectory . With the help of the moment of 619 inertia and the principal axes of the translocation domain , the average 620 radius r of a cylinder superposed to the protein was calculated as : 621 r = (cid:112) 2 I / m , where I is the moment of inertia with respect to the axis 622 of the cylinder and m is the total molar mass of the C α atoms . 623 To analyze the solvent partition in the protein domain , the spatial 624 density function ( SDF ) distribution of the solvent molecules around 625 the protein was calculated , using the VolMap tool provided by VMD 626 [ 51 ] . After translational and rotational fitting of the system to a ref - 627 erence conformation of the protein ( the one in the initial frame ) , the 628 positions of selected solvent atoms ( the oxygen atom in water , the oxy - 629 gen atom of the hydroxyl moiety and the carbon atom of the methyl 630 group in the ethanol , respectively ) were mapped onto a cubic grid 631 with a grid spacing of 1 ˚A centered on the protein . The grid densities 632 have then been averaged over the number of analyzed frames . 633 5 . 4 Coarse - grained modeling of the helices 1 634 and 2 635 The helices 1 and 2 ( Fig . 1A ) were described in a coarse - grained man - 636 ner : we have assumed that they are elastic cylindrical tubes . In that 637 framework , the axes of helix 1 and helix 2 were defined using the 638 method originally developed by Kahn [ 52 ] . The starting and last pro - 639 tein residues of the tubes were fixed using the helix limits given in 640 Table 1 . The hydrophobic residues considered in a given α helix were 641 selected in the following way : the residues GLY , ALA , VAL , LEU , 642 ILE , PRO , PHE , MET and TRP classically considered as hydropho - 643 bic , supplemented at pH 4 . 7 with the protonated residue GLU - 809 . 644 Each tube could interact with the membrane via the hydrophobic at - 645 traction between the protein residues and the lipid tails of the mem - 646 brane bilayer . To understand this interaction , we had to consider the 647 orientations of the residues with respect to each other . 648 Using the relative positions of hydrophobic residues k of the con - 649 sidered α helix ( Table S3 ) , a set of vectors was determined which are 650 normal to the axis . Each vector V k connects the axis to the C α atom 651 17 of residue k ( see Fig 9 ) . If all of these vectors were parallel , the hy - 652 drophobic residues would align on a straight line , the helix would be 653 amphipathic and could insert itself into the membrane without un - 654 dergoing an elastic deformation . When the angle θ kl between V k and 655 V l of two consecutive hydrophobic residues k and l is non zero , the 656 tube has to twist to align the two residues . The torque T kl resulting 657 from the non - alignment of the residue is proportional to the angle θ kl 658 in lowest order and anti - proportional to the distance D kl between the 659 points P k and P l . For a cylindrical tube T kl is given by [ 53 , 54 , 55 ] 660 T kl = JG θ kl D kl , ( 1 ) where J = π 2 R 4 is the polar moment of inertia of the tube’s cylindri - 661 cal cross section with radius R and G is the shear modulus . In the 662 following we will use the scaled torque ˜ T kl : = T kl JG . For proteins , due to 663 the variability of their structures , only sparse experimental informa - 664 tion is available for the value of GJ . Indeed , only few cases have been 665 studied in detail : values for a large protein complex ( IgG / G protein ) 666 are of the order of 45000 pNnm 2 , whereas a value of only 400 pNnm 2 667 was found for the flexible DNA double helix [ 54 , 55 ] . From the point 668 of view of sizes and internal mobility the BoNT helices 1 and 2 are 669 in between these two cases . We can thus expect values between the 670 numerical values quoted above . 671 The torque vectors are all parallel to the axis . A positive sign of 672 ˜ T kl indicates that the vector is aligned from the N to the C terminal 673 extremities of the helix sequence , whereas it is aligned in the opposite 674 direction when the sign is negative . A python script using the library 675 MDAnalysis [ 50 ] has been specifically developed for the calculation of 676 the torques . 677 6 Author contributions 678 Conceptualization , T . E . M . and M .
