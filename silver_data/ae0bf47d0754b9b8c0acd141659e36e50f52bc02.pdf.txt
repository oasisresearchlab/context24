Although a multiple feedback loop circuit has been shown to generate the 24h 21 rhythm , it remains unclear how robust the clock is in individual cells , or how clock 22 timing is coordinated across the plant . Here we examine clock activity at the single 23 cell level across Arabidopsis seedlings over several days under constant 24 environmental conditions . Our data reveal robust single cell oscillations , albeit 25 desynchronised . In particular , we observe two waves of clock activity ; one going 26 down , and one up the root . We also find evidence of cell - to - cell coupling of the clock , 27 especially in the root tip . A simple model shows that cell - to - cell coupling and our 28 measured period differences between cells can generate the observed waves . Our 29 2 results reveal the spatial structure of the plant clock and suggest that unlike the 30 centralised mammalian clock , the Arabidopsis clock has multiple coordination points . 31 Introduction 32 33 The circadian clock controls gene expression throughout the day and night in most 34 organisms , from single cell photosynthetic bacteria to mammals ( Bell - Pedersen et al . , 35 2005 ; Dunlap & Loros , 2017 ) . In many cases a core circuit that generates this rhythm 36 has been elucidated and been shown to oscillate in single cells . In multi - cellular 37 organisms these single cell rhythms can be integrated to allow a coordinated response 38 to the environment ( Bell - Pedersen et al . , 2005 ) . Mammals achieve this by driving 39 oscillations in peripheral tissues from a central pacemaker in the brain , the 40 suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ) ( Pando , Morse , Cermakian , & Sassone - Corsi , 2002 ; 41 Reppert & Weaver , 2002 ) . 42 The Arabidopsis circadian clock generates a 24h rhythm in multiple key processes , 43 including stomata opening , photosynthesis , and hypocotyl elongation ( Hsu & Harmer , 44 2014 ) . A hierarchical structure for the plant clock has recently been proposed , similar 45 to that for the mammalian clock , where the shoot clock drives the rhythms in the 46 leaves and roots ( Takahashi , Hirata , Aihara , & Mas , 2015 ) . However , there are further 47 tissue dependent differences that must be explained . For example , experiments using 48 a luciferase reporter for clock activity have shown waves of clock gene expression in 49 leaves ( Fukuda , Nakamichi , Hisatsune , Murase , & Mizuno , 2007 ; Wenden , Toner , 50 Hodge , Grima , & Millar , 2012 ) , as well as striped expression patterns in roots 51 ( Fukuda , Ukai , & Oyama , 2012 ) . 52 3 Beyond the coordination of plant rhythms , how robust the circadian clock is in 53 individual cells across the plant is also unclear . Through integration of data from 54 whole plant studies , a genetic circuit consisting of multiple coupled feedback loops 55 has been proposed to generate the 24h rhythm ( Fogelmark & Troein , 2014 ; Pokhilko 56 et al . , 2012 ) . Simulations of this network display stable oscillations ( Figure 1a ) , 57 although experimental measurements of clock rhythms under constant conditions 58 often display damped rhythms ( Figure 1b ) ( Gould et al . , 2013 ; Locke et al . , 2005 , 59 2006 ; Salomé & McClung , 2005 ) . The damping is characterised by the reduction in 60 amplitude of the oscillations through time . This damping at the whole plant level 61 could be due to the clock circuit in all individual cells damping ( top , Figure 1c ) , or to 62 cells desynchronising due to different intrinsic periods or phases ( Guerriero et al . , 63 2012 ; Komin , Murza , Hernández - García , & Toral , 2010 ) ( bottom , Figure 1c ) , or cells 64 desynchronising due to stochasticity in clock activity ( Guerriero et al . , 2012 ) . 65 Previous studies have attempted to measure the clock in Arabidopsis at single - cell 66 resolution ; however , these have been confounded by poor temporal / spatial resolution 67 and short time series ( Takahashi et al . , 2015 ; Yakir et al . , 2011 ) . 68 Here , using a reporter for the core clock gene CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 69 ( CCA1 ) ( Wang & Tobin , 1998 ) , we examine the dynamics of the Arabidopsis clock 70 across the whole plant at the single cell level over several days . Our results reveal that 71 damping of rhythms at the whole plant level is mainly due to desynchronisation of 72 oscillating single cells with different periods , and not due to noise in gene expression 73 due to low molecule numbers or damping of individual oscillations . We observe two 74 waves of clock gene expression , one up and one down the root . These waves , 75 combined with more variable clock periods at each position in the root , cause the 76 most desynchronisation . From our single cell data , we are able to estimate the 77 4 coupling strength between cells , and find evidence of coupling , especially strong in 78 the root tip . A simple model suggests that our observed period differences , plus cell - 79 to - cell coupling , can generate the observed waves in clock gene expression . Thus , our 80 data has revealed both the structure and robustness of the plant circadian clock 81 system . 82 83 Results 84 To analyse the dynamics of the plant clock at the single cell level , we constructed 85 reporter lines that allowed us to quantitatively measure the nuclear level of the core 86 clock protein CCA1 ( Wang & Tobin , 1998 ) . These reporter lines contained a CCA1 - 87 YFP protein fusion construct driven by the CCA1 promoter in a cca1 - 11 mutant 88 background . They also contained a 35S : : H2B - RFP nuclear marker to enable 89 automatic detection of individual nuclei ( Federici , Dupuy , Laplaze , Heisler , & 90 Haseloff , 2012 ) . By screening the clock phenotypes of multiple reporter lines we 91 ensured that our reporter construct was functional and rescued the period phenotype 92 of the cca1 - 11 mutant ( Figure 1 - figure supplement 1 ) . We took forward both a 93 rescued wild - type period ( WT ) and a long period ( CCA1 - long ) reporter line for 94 further analysis . 95 96 We carried out time - lapse movies of Arabidopsis seedlings using a custom developed 97 time - lapse confocal microscope setup ( Figure 1 - figure supplement 2 ) . In order to 98 examine the intrinsic behaviour of the clock we first entrained the seedlings to 12 : 12h 99 light / dark cycles before examining the clock under constant conditions ( constant blue 100 light ( 30 μmol m - 2 s - 1 ) and temperature ( 22 °C ) ) . Our method allowed us to track and 101 5 extract fluorescence values from the same individual nuclei over several days ( Figure 102 1d , e ) . We first examined the average CCA1 - YFP nuclear fluorescence signal from 103 regions of the hypocotyl , cotyledon and roots ( Figure 1f , g ) . We observed a robust 104 oscillation in the cotyledon ( red line , Figure 1g ) and hypocotyl ( blue line , Figure 1g ) , 105 although with slight damping to the amplitude . In the top part of the root we observed 106 strong damping of the circadian rhythm ( black line , Figure 1g ) , although the 107 oscillations recovered somewhat in the root tip ( grey line , Figure 1g ) . Three repeat 108 plants showed similar behaviour ( Figure 1 - figure supplement 3 ) . We also observed 109 similar behaviour in our CCA1 - long reporter line ( Figure 1 - figure supplement 4 ) , 110 showing that our results remain true across a range of clock activity . 111 112 To determine the underlying cause of the damping in different tissues , we examined 113 the clock rhythm in hundreds of cells from each seedling analysed ( Figure 1h , Figure 114 1 - figure supplement 3b , 4b , 5 ) . Oscillations could be observed in all tissues , with 115 most cells displaying circadian rhythms ( see Figure 1 - source data 1 , 2 for percentage 116 of cells scored rhythmic for each plant section ) . Analysis of single cell oscillation 117 amplitudes during the course of the movie revealed stable oscillations , with only a 118 slight reduction in median oscillation amplitude in the root ( Figure 1 - figure 119 supplement 6 ) . Neither the strong damping at the tissue level in the root ( Figure 1g ) , 120 nor the damping observed at the plant level ( Figure 1a ) , can be explained by 121 individual cells losing rhythmicity ( Figure 1h , Figure 1 - figure supplement 6 ) . We then 122 examined the synchrony between cells and robustness of these rhythms in more detail . 123 The hypocotyl and cotyledon were the most synchronised , with the amplitude of the 124 mean trace nearly equalling the median amplitude of the individual cell time - series 125 ( Figure 2a , Figure 2 - figure supplement 1 , 2 ) . The hypocotyl and cotyledon rhythms 126 6 also exhibited low period variability both within and between time traces , indicating a 127 high level of robustness ( Figure 2b , Figure 2 - figure supplement 1b , 2b ) . However , the 128 root displayed significant desynchronisation , with the amplitude of the mean trace 129 lower than the median amplitude of the individual cell traces ( Figure 2a , Figure 2 - 130 figure supplement 1a , 2a ) , with higher variability in period within and between single 131 cell lineages ( Figure 2b and Figure 2 - figure supplement 1b , 2b ) . 132 133 We next asked whether the damping of amplitude in the mean rhythm is caused by 134 noise in gene expression due to low clock molecule numbers , as proposed by previous 135 stochastic modelling ( Guerriero et al . , 2012 ) . Simulations of the stochastic model of 136 the Arabidopsis gene network ( Guerriero et al . , 2012 ) display greater 137 desynchronisation as the system size , effectively the simulated number of molecules 138 in the cell , is reduced ( Figure 2c - e ) . The lower the molecule number , the more 139 desynchronisation at the single cell level , and the more damping of the mean 140 expression ( red line , Figure 2c ) , even though the individual traces do not display a 141 damped rhythm . To explore this further , we simulated the model for a range of system 142 sizes ( Figure 2c ) and examined the synchrony and robustness of the simulations 143 ( Figure 2d , e ) . Previously the system size was estimated to be on the order of 100 144 molecules per cell ( bottom panel , Figure 2c ) in order for the desynchronisation 145 observed in whole plant measurements to be explained solely by noise ( Guerriero et 146 al . , 2012 ) . We compared the level of synchrony and period variability from 147 simulations of this model to our experimentally measured single cell rhythms . The 148 single cell rhythms that we detect in the hypocotyl and cotyledon have a lower period 149 variability ( Figure 2b ) than a system size of 100 and in fact behave closer to a system 150 size of 1000 ( Figure 2e ) . The hypocotyl and cotyledon also have a smaller difference 151 7 between the amplitude of the mean trace ( green line ) compared to the median 152 amplitude of the individual cell time - series ( red line ) ( Figure 2a ) than a system size of 153 100 ( Figure 2d ) , and again behaves closer to a system size of 1000 ( Figure 2d ) . The 154 level of desynchronisation observed in the root and root tip , however , behave more 155 like a simulated system size of 100 ( Figure 2a - e ) . Similar CCA1 - YFP expression 156 levels are observed across the plant ( Figure 2f , g ) , so it is unlikely that this lack of 157 robustness is due solely to a change of total molecule number for the clock system in 158 different parts of the plant . In fact the amplitude and expression levels of the single 159 cell oscillations in the root tip are high compared to other sections across the plant 160 ( Figure 2f , g and Figure 2 - figure supplement 1a , c - d , 2a , c - d ) . 161 If the strong damping in the root is not a result of noise due to low clock molecule 162 numbers , or individual cells losing rhythmicity , what is the cause ? The measured 163 variable and desynchronous rhythms in the root suggest that the clock could be 164 behaving differently in different parts of the root . To test this possibility we plotted 165 the period of the individual cell oscillations across the plant ( Figure 3a , b and Figure 166 2 - figure supplement 1e , f and 2e , f ) . We observed surprising spatial structure to the 167 clock in the root . The upper sections of the root displayed longer periods than the rest 168 of the plant , as reported previously for the whole root ( James et al . , 2008 ) . However , 169 we observed very fast rhythms in the root tip ( Figure 3a , b ) , which is also the section 170 with very high expression rhythms ( Figure 2f , g ) . Although we do not observe 171 evidence of phase resetting in the root tip , as proposed in an earlier luciferase study 172 ( Fukuda et al . , 2012 ) , this could be due to our different growth conditions and stage of 173 plant development . A repeat plant showed similar results ( Figure 2 - figure supplement 174 1c - f ) , as did the CCA1 - long reporter line ( Figure 2 - figure supplement 2c - f ) . Each 175 radial section of the plant along the longitudinal axis can be made up of multiple cell 176 8 types . Therefore , we next tested whether the rhythms have any spatial structure in the 177 z direction , which would suggest that different cell types have different period 178 rhythms . Plots of period in the z direction in each section do not reveal any 179 discernible pattern ( Figure 3c , d , Figure 2 - figure supplement 3 ) . This suggests that the 180 differences in rhythms we observe are not restricted to a specific cell type . 181 182 To further understand the spatial structure of the clock , we examined montages of 183 clock gene expression ( Figure 3e ; Figure 2 - figure supplement 1g ; Videos 1 - 3 ) and 184 timing of peaks of expression ( Figure 3f - h ) across the plant . Examination of the clock 185 phase between 48h and 72h reveals that the clock peaks earlier in the hypocotyl 186 ( mean phase in upper hypocotyl 51 . 2h ± 1 . 1h , mean phase in lower hypocotyl 52 . 1h ± 187 1 . 5h ) than in the cotyledon ( mean phase 55 . 6h ± 2 . 3h ) ( Figure 3f - h ) . From the top of 188 the root the phase of the clock is shifted to later in the day as you go down the root 189 ( upper root mean phase 56 . 6h ± 4 . 5h ) ( Figure 3h ) . However , from the root tip ( mean 190 phase 56 . 2h ± 5 . 0h ) the phase of the clock is shifted to later in the day as you go up 191 ( lower root phase 58 . 0h ± 4 . 4h ) . This generates two waves in the montages of clock 192 gene expression , one going up and one going down the root ( Figure 3e ; Video 1 ; 193 Figure 2 - figure supplement 1g , 2g ) . At each y position in the root the phases are also 194 more variable than in the rest of the plant , with a standard deviation of phases of 195 ±5 . 0h in the root tip compared to ±1 . 1h in the hypocotyl for phases occurring between 196 48h and 72h ( Figure 3h ) . Thus , the damped mean rhythm of clock activity we 197 observed in the root ( Figure 1g ) is caused by the averaging of these two waves of 198 gene expression that have a broad distribution of phases . We observed qualitatively 199 similar waves in luciferase reporter lines for the clock genes PSEUDO - RESPONSE 200 REGULATOR 9 ( Ito et al . , 2003 ) ( Figure 3i ; Video 4 ) , CCA1 ( Figure 3 - figure 201 9 supplement 1a ) and GIGANTEA ( Park et al . , 1999 ) ( Figure 3 - figure supplement 1b ) , 202 suggesting that our results are a general property of the clock . 203 204 The coherent waves of gene expression suggested that the plant clock signal could be 205 coupled . To estimate this coupling , we calculated the order parameter ( Kuramoto , 206 1984 ) from our single cell data and estimated the coupling strength based on a 207 technique developed for mammalian circadian cells ( Rougemont & Naef , 2007 ) . We 208 observed signs of coupling across the plant , with the strongest evidence for coupling 209 in the root tip , where the order parameter actually increased with time ( Figure 3j and 210 Figure 2 - figure supplement 2 - 4 ) . Interestingly this occurred where cell density was 211 highest , as observed in cultured SCN cells ( Aton , Colwell , Harmar , Waschek , & 212 Herzog , 2005 ) . To investigate the mechanism for the waves of clock gene expression 213 in the root we developed a simple mathematical model where the cells are described 214 by coupled oscillators with different periods , as informed by the data ( Figure 3k ) . The 215 periods of the clock in the model were faster in the shoot and root tip than the rest of 216 the root , as measured experimentally . This simple model can generate waves of gene 217 expression up and down the root that produce a bow wave in the space - time plot 218 ( Figure 3k ) , similar to that observed experimentally ( Figure 3h , i ) . 219 220 Discussion 221 222 Our single cell measurements have revealed tissue specific differences in the phases 223 and robustness of the clock in Arabidopsis . These differences are not restricted to one 224 cell type , as similar periods are observed in the z dimension through the plant ( Figure 225 3c , d ) , suggesting that cells are instead responding to information based on their 226 10 longitudinal position . The observed robust rhythms in the hypocotyl that peak before 227 the cotyledon and roots are in line with a proposed hierarchical structure for the plant 228 clock , where the shoot clock drives the rhythms in the leaves and roots ( Takahashi et 229 al . , 2015 ) . However , our results suggest that the structure of the plant clock is more 230 complicated , as this hierarchical model does not explain the observed short period 231 oscillations in the root tip . Our results support a more decentralised model of clock 232 coordination in plants ( Endo , 2016 ; Endo , Shimizu , Nohales , Araki , & Kay , 2014 ) . 233 234 Earlier studies of the Arabidopsis clock argue either that cellular oscillations are 235 uncoupled ( Thain , Hall , & Millar , 2000 ; Yakir et al . , 2011 ) , or weakly , but detectably , 236 coupled ( Fukuda et al . , 2007 , 2012 ; James et al . , 2008 ; Takahashi et al . , 2015 ; 237 Wenden et al . , 2012 ) . Coupling has also been detected in Lemna gibba fronds , as 238 examination of a clock bioluminescence reporter with single cell resolution showed 239 weak coupling between individual clock oscillators under constant conditions 240 ( Muranaka & Oyama , 2016 ) . These heterogeneous oscillations could be synchronised 241 by light - dark cycles ( Okada , Muranaka , Ito , & Oyama , 2017 ) . Our single cell 242 approach is consistent with weak coupling across the whole plant but reveals regions 243 with strong local coupling between cells , especially in the root tip , which is sufficient 244 to drive an increase in synchrony with time . In the future , it will be interesting to 245 examine whether the shoot apical meristem , which has a high cell density like the root 246 tip , has a similarly high coupling strength given its role in driving rhythms in the 247 shoot ( Takahashi et al . , 2015 ) . 248 249 Our modelling reveals that cell - cell coupling together with the observed period 250 differences between tissues is sufficient to replicate the decentralised spatial structure 251 11 of the clock that we observe experimentally . Our simple model offers a qualitative 252 match to data . In the future it will be interesting to develop more mechanistic models 253 of the plant circadian clock at the single cell level , as has been done at the bulk level 254 previously ( Fogelmark & Troein , 2014 ; Guerriero et al . , 2012 ; Locke et al . , 2005 , 255 2006 ; Pokhilko et al . , 2012 ) . One barrier to achieving this is that currently our 256 estimations of clock periods from single cells are from the intact plant , and so will 257 include the effects of cell - cell coupling . To develop mechanistic models at the single 258 cell - level it will be critical to develop reliable methods to measure the rhythmic 259 properties of physiologically representative plant cells in physical isolation . It will 260 also be important to test future models by examining the clock experimentally under a 261 range of environmental conditions and at different developmental stages . 262 263 Decentralised coordination could create flexibility and allow parts of the plant to 264 respond differentially to environmental perturbations . There is already evidence that 265 the root clock may respond differently to light than the shoot ( Bordage , Sullivan , 266 Laird , Millar , & Nimmo , 2016 ; Nimmo , 2018 ) , and that the vasculature and epidermal 267 clock regulate distinct physiological processes ( Shimizu et al . , 2015 ) . It has been 268 recently shown that initiation of lateral roots triggers the resetting of the clock in the 269 emerging lateral root ( Voß et al . , 2015 ) . In the case of lateral roots auxin is proposed 270 to be involved in resetting the clock ( Voß et al . , 2015 ) . Waves of auxin also occur in 271 the root ( Moreno - Risueno et al . , 2010 ) , and it will be interesting to examine if the 272 circadian clock wave is linked to these auxin dynamics . An important next step will 273 be to investigate what the coupling signal is for the plant circadian clock ( Covington 274 & Harmer , 2007 ; Dalchau et al . , 2011 ; Haydon , Mielczarek , Robertson , Hubbard , & 275 Webb , 2013 ) . 276 12 277 References 278 Aton , S .

The CCA1 : : CCA1 - YFP was constructed as follows : The coding region 471 of CCA1 was amplified from Arabidopsis ( Ws ) genomic DNA using the primer pair 472 CCA1 _ CDS _ Fwd ( 5’ - AAAGGATCCATGGAGACAAATTCGTCTGGA - 3’ ) and 473 CCA1 _ CDS _ Rev ( 5’ - ATACCCGGGTGTGGAAGCTTGAGTTTCCAA - 3’ ) . The 474 CCA1 promoter region was amplified from Arabidopsis ( Ws ) genomic DNA using the 475 primer pair CCA1 _ prom _ Fwd ( 5’ - 476 AAAGAATTCATTTAGTCTTCTACCCTTCATGC - 3’ ) and the CCA1 _ prom _ Rev 477 ( 5’ - ATAGGATCCCACTAAGCTCCTCTACACAACTTC - 3’ ) . Unique restriction 478 21 sites were designed at the ends of the amplicons to facilitate cloning . The fragment of 479 CCA1 coding region was cloned in the modified pPCV812 binary plasmid ( Pfeiffer et 480 al . , 2009 ) between the 35S promoter and the YFP gene via Bam HI ( 5’ ) and Sma I ( 3’ ) 481 sites , resulting in 35S : : CCA1 - YFP . Next , the 35S promoter was replaced by the CCA1 482 promoter fragment via Eco RI ( 5’ ) and Bam HI ( 3’ ) sites , resulting in CCA1 : : CCA1 - 483 YFP . The cloned CCA1 promoter fragment was 862 bp in length and contained the 484 full 5’ - untranslated region , but not the ATG . The 35S : : H2B - RFP construct was 485 described previously in ( Federici et al . , 2012 ) . The PRR9 : LUC , CCA1 : LUC and 486 GI : LUC reporters are in the Col - 0 background and were also described previously 487 ( Palagyi et al . , 2010 ) . 488 489 Plant growth material . The CCA1 : : CCA1 - YFP construct was transformed in cca1 - 490 11 ( Ws ) mutant background ( Hall et al . , 2003 ) . Homozygous T3 generations of 491 several independent transgenic lines were checked for complementation via delayed 492 fluorescence ( Gould et al . , 2009 ) ( Figure 1 - figure supplement 1b , c ) . The 493 CCA1 : : CCA1 - YFP expressing line showing full complementation was then re - 494 transformed with 35S : : H2B - RFP which was used for tracking purposes during 495 analysis ( Federici et al . , 2012 ) . 496 497 Arabidopsis seed were surface sterilised and suspended in 0 . 1 % top agar and placed 498 in 4 °C for 2 days . After sowing , seeds were grown inside of growth incubators 499 ( Sanyo MLR - 352 ) under 12 : 12 LD cycles in 80 umol m 2 s - 1 cool white light at 22 °C 500 for entrainment . Henceforth , these conditions are referred to as entrainment 501 conditions . 502 503 22 Luciferase and delayed fluorescence bulk imaging . 10 - 20 seed were sown onto 504 Murashige and Skoog ( MS ) 2 % agar in clear 96 well microtitre plates with at least 8 505 wells per line . A second clear microtitre plate was placed on top of the plate 506 containing the seed to increase well height . These were then sealed using porous tape 507 ( Micropore ) . Seedlings were grown for 9 days under entrainment conditions and 508 transferred to experimental conditions on dawn of the 10 th day . For luciferase 509 experiments , on the 9 th day seedlings were sprayed with a 5 mM luciferin solution in 510 0 . 001 % Triton x - 100 before transfer to experimental conditions on dawn of the 10 th 511 day . 512 513 Imaging was carried out in Sanyo temperature controlled cabinets ( MIR - 553 or MIR - 514 154 ) at 22 °C and under an equ al mix of red and blue LEDs ( 40 μmol m - 2 sec - 1 total ) . 515 Seedlings were imaged using an ORCA - II - BT ( Hamamatsu Photonics , Japan ) or 516 LUMO CCD camera ( QImaging , Canada ) . Experiments were run over several days 517 with images being taken every hour as described previously ( Gould et al . , 2013 ; 518 Litthauer , Battle , Lawson , & Jones , 2015 ) . Image analysis was carried out using 519 Imaris ( Bitplane , Switzerland ) or ImageJ ( NIH , USA ) . 520 521 Luciferase macro imaging . Seedlings were sown in a row of eight seedlings on 2 % 522 agar media supplemented with MS media . Seedlings were grown upright for four days 523 under entrainment conditions . Imaging commenced on dawn of the fifth day . Imaging 524 was performed inside of Sanyo plant growth incubators at 22 °C under an equal mix 525 of red and blue light emitting diodes ( 40 μmol m - 2 sec - 1 total ) ( Figure 3i , Figure 3 - 526 figure supplement 1a ) or under blue light emitting diodes ( 40 μmol m - 2 sec - 1 total ) 527 ( Figure 3 - figure supplement 1b ) . Seedlings were imaged upright using a LUMO 528 23 CCD camera ( QImaging , Canada ) . Experiments were run over several days with 529 images being taken every 90 minutes . 530 531 Confocal microscopy . For confocal experiments seed were sown directly onto glass 532 bottom dishes ( Greiner , Austria ) in an array format . Once dry , the seed were covered 533 with 5 ml MS 2 % agar media in absence of sucrose . Once set , dishes were sealed with 534 porous tape ( Micropore ) and grown upright under entrainment conditions for 4 days . 535 After 4 days plates were ready for imaging . 536 537 The microscopy pipeline is outlined in Figure 1 - figure supplement 2 . Up to 18 538 seedlings were grown in an array format on glass bottom dishes . At dawn on the 4 th 539 day of growth the dishes were fixed into the confocal temperature controlled stage ( 22 540 °C ) using the dish manifold . To maintain correct light conditions ( 30 μmol m - 2 s - 2 541 constant blue light ) a custom - made light emitting diode ( LED ) rig was used . Growth 542 conditions allowed slow growth during the movie , which enabled easier tracking of 543 single cells . A Zeiss 710 ( Zeiss , Germany ) inverted confocal microscope with a 544 40x / 1 . 2 water corrected oil objective was used for all imaging . YFP and RFP 545 excitation was produced using a 514 nm laser and a main beamsplitter ( MBS ) 546 458 / 514 . The 514nm laser was set to 4 % power for all experiments . To reduce 547 problems with auto - fluorescence and improve signal to noise ratio a lambda scan was 548 carried using a ChS PMT and filters 492 - 658 . Brightfield ( BF ) used a ChD PMT . 549 Imaging was carried out using a 0 . 6 zoom to increase field of view . A motorised stage 550 was used to allow multiple positions to be imaged across the plant per experimental 551 run . The diameter of nuclei in our seedlings ranges in size from 6 μm ( root tip ) to 15 552 μm ( hypocotyl ) . A resolution of 2 μm in the z dimension was chosen to allow the 553 24 capture of several slices through each nucleus . Data was auto saved during imaging 554 with data split into files by position imaged . 555 556 Processing confocal images . Firstly blank images created by time - lapse being 557 terminated early were removed in ImageJ . Also with ImageJ , lambda scans produced 558 during confocal imaging were split into YFP ( 511 to 547 nm ) , RFP ( 586 to 625 nm ) 559 and brightfield ( BF ) spectrums and then reduced in dimensionality to give one 560 channel for each wavelength . Data was then saved as OME TIFF , writing each time 561 point as a separate file . Once processed all the data was loaded into Imaris ( Bitplane , 562 Switzerland ) and merged to produce one file containing YFP , RFP and BF . A median 563 filter size 3x3x1 was then applied across all of the data . Detection of YFP / RFP 564 expressing cells was carried out using the spot detection feature and tracking of spots 565 over time was carried out using an autoregressive motion model using an estimated 566 cell x , y diameter of 6 - 10 μm . Data was then exported in excel format for further 567 analysis . Details are provided in the subsequent section . Quality control checks were 568 carried out at multiple points ( see Figure 1 - figure supplement 2 ) . The first quality 569 check was made to ensure that the seedling remained in the focal plane during the 570 course of the experiment . If not , the dataset was not carried forward for further 571 analysis . The second check was to make sure that no mistakes were made in the 572 processing of the images ( described above ) . This was carried out by examining the 573 data in Imaris and ensuring that RFP signal was detected throughout the movie . The 574 third check was carried out to correct any errors in tracking cells across the time - lapse 575 data . The fourth check used the videos to more closely monitor the data for anything 576 that looked problematic . The final check used the graphs to identify any problems that 577 may have occurred during the whole single cell pipeline . If the laser power was not 578 25 found to be stable during the course of the imaging , which could be observed by 579 fluctuations in the background fluorescence , the dataset was not carried forward for 580 further analysis . 581 582 Single cell data processing . Period analysis was carried out in BioDare , an online 583 system for data sharing and analysis ( Costa et al . , 2013 ; Moore , Zielinski , & Millar , 584 2014 ) . Since most of the period analysis methods in BioDare require evenly spaced 585 time series , the data was first interpolated ( usin g MATLAB’s ( MathWorks , U . K . ) 586 interp1 function and spacing of 1h ) . Period estimates were obtained by three different 587 methods : Spectrum Resampling ( Costa et al . , 2013 ) , FFT - NLLS ( Johnson & Frasier , 588 1985 ; Straume , Frasier - Cadoret , & Johnson , 2002 ) and mFourFit ( Edwards et al . , 589 2010 ) . Cells were classed as rhythmic only if each method identified them as 590 rhythmic ( i . e . BioDare did not ask to ignore them ) , their goodness of fit was below 1 591 for FFT - NLLS and mFourfit or 0 . 9 for Spectrum Resampling and all estimates 592 obtained by different methods were within 2 . 5h of each other . In Figure 3 , Figure 2 – 593 supplement 1 and 2 , the FFT - NLLS period estimates are shown . Period variability 594 within and between cells was calculated as described previously ( Kellogg & Tay , 595 2015 ) . 596 597 Since some of the sections imaged overlap ( e . g . Figure 2f ; Figure 3a ; Figure 2 - figure 598 supplement 1c , 2c ) , in order to not count cells multiple times , some of the cells were 599 removed . This was done in the following manner : if there was an area of overlap in 600 multiple sections , only cells belonging to the sections with lower x and y positions 601 were kept , e . g . in Figure 3a , any cells in the upper hypocotyl section that also belong 602 spatially to the lower hypocotyl section , were removed from subsequent analysis . In 603 26 the repeat WT experiment the root tip section imaged encompasses a longer section of 604 the root ( Figure 2 - figure supplement 1c ) . Hence , in order to make the analysis 605 comparable to WT ( Figure 3 ) , we split the root tip section for further analysis . We 606 considered the root tip cells of the repeat to be only those less than 0 . 18 mm from the 607 actual tip , while the rest of them were classed as ‘Root up from tip’ ( Figure 2 - figure 608 supplement 1a , b ) . 609 610 In the case of analysis at tissue level , where multiple sections had to be pooled for 611 analysis ( e . g . Figure 1g , h and Figure 1 - figure supplement 3 , 4 , 5 ) , since different 612 sections were imaged at different times , before any further statistics were done , all the 613 data was interpolated at the times where measurements across any section were made . 614 615 For analysis of amplitudes , peak and trough times for the individual cells ( Figure 1 - 616 figure supplement 6 ; Figure 2a , f , g ; Figure 2 - figure supplement 1a , e , f ; Figure 2 - 617 figure supplement 2a , e , f ) were identified using the findpeaks function in MATLAB . 618 This was done on linearly detrended data . In case of the WT data ( Figure 2 ) , since the 619 data is sampled more frequently ( every 1 . 1h vs . 3h in WT repeat and CCA1 - long 620 line ) , the data is noisier , hence a smoothing filter ( robust local regression using 621 weighted linear least squares and a 2 nd degree polynomial model ) was also applied 622 after linear detrending . Amplitudes of traces were calculated as a mean of all trough 623 to peak and peak to trough amplitudes . For amplitude calculations , only rhythmic 624 cells that had at least 3 peaks detected during the movie were analysed . Also , if the 625 number of peaks and troughs identified by the analysis differed by more than 1 the 626 cell was discarded from the analysis . 627 628 27 629 Luciferase space - time analysis . To facilitate analysis , individual seedlings were 630 manually cropped into individual time stacks using ImageJ . From these image stacks 631 a rectangular region of interest ( ROI ) containing the full length of the root and as 632 much length of the hypocotyl as possible , whilst still excluding the cotyledons , was 633 defined . Custom developed MATLAB scripts were used to extract luminescence data 634 for each pixel in the ROI , giving time series for each pixel . After inspection of the 635 images and the time series , some features were identified and the following measures 636 applied to address them : 637 638 I . Occasionally the cotyledon of the seedling or of a neighbouring seedling 639 protrudes into the ROI . At this stage the ROI was checked for pixels of 640 overlapping seedlings and these regions were manually removed from the 641 affected frames . 642 643 II . Inside of the ROI the hypocotyl and root are surrounded by peripheral 644 background pixels . The root and hypocotyl were segmented from the 645 background using the mean of the grey levels as the threshold . The algorithm 646 was applied to each image in the stack individually . 647 648 III . Commonly supposed to be from solar cosmic rays , pixel spikes in intensity 649 values occur sporadically in images . A 3 - by - 3 pixel median filter is applied to 650 each image to remove these spikes . 651 652 28 IV . The luminescence signal strength in a single seedling is weak and therefore 653 the signal to noise ratio relatively low . A third order Butterworth filter was 654 applied to pixel time series to remove high frequency noise . Time series were 655 filtered using MATLAB’s filtfi lt . m function , which performs in the forward 656 and reverse direction to avoid phase distortion . A cut off frequency of 15 % of 657 the Nyquist frequency was identified as a best fit to our data . 658 659 V . In all experiments we observed dampening of the signal over time . Time series 660 were therefore amplitude de - trended to better visualise spatial patterns . Time 661 series were de - trended using the algorithms developed for the mFourfit toolkit 662 ( Edwards et al . , 2010 ) . 663 664 To visualise spatial patterns across the length of the root , space - time plots of the root 665 luminescence were created ( Fig . 3i , Figure 3 - figure supplement 1 ) . To do this we take 666 the maximum signal intensity across one pixel wide longitudinal sections of the root 667 for each image and assign this value to position m , n of the space time plot , where m is 668 the image number and n the longitudinal section . The space - time plots presented 669 include 10 pixels of the hypocotyl . The mean luminescence is normalised so that the 670 peak expression of each longitudinal section ( n ) is 1 . 671 672 Model simulation . In Figure 1a we simulate an existing deterministic model of the 673 clock ( Pokhilko et al . , 2012 ) . The model was run for 168h from introduction into 674 constant light conditions and LHY / CCA1 mRNA is reported ( in the model CCA1 and 675 LHY are treated as a single component ( Pokhilko et al . , 2012 ) ) . 676 677 29 In Figure 2 , we simulated a stochastic model of an existing circadian clock model 678 ( Guerriero et al . , 2012 ; Pokhilko et al . , 2012 ) . In Guerriero et al , the model is scaled 679 by the parameter Ω , so that a molecule count close to Ω is obtained . For detailed 680 description of the scaling , the reader can refer to this paper . Comparison of the model 681 simulated for different Ω values to the previously published data indicates that the 682 model molecule count of a few hundred cells ( i . e . Ω ) is a good prediction of the actual 683 molecule count ( Guerriero et al . , 2012 ) . Here we have taken the same circadian clock 684 model and simulated it for various values of Ω . Model equations scaled for the Ω 685 factor are given in ( Guerriero et al . , 2012 ) . The model was simulated for 200h from 686 introduction into constant light conditions and 100 simulation runs ( proxy for 100 687 cells ) were performed . The stochastic simulations were performed using the Gillespie 688 algorithm ( Gillespie , 1977 ) . For each simulation , further analysis of amplitudes and 689 period was done after the simulated data was interpolated at 2h intervals and then 690 only for the simulated data from 28h to 168h in LL , in order to be closely comparable 691 to the time interval of the original single cell data ( Figure 1d ) . The Gillespie 692 algorithm was written in MATLAB and the amplitudes and periods of the simulations 693 were extracted using the MATLAB findpeaks function . Periods were calculated as a 694 mean difference of peak - to - peak intervals . Amplitudes were calculated as a mean of 695 all trough to peak and peak to trough amplitudes . 696 697 Synchronisation analysis . 698 For a set of individual cells , the inter - cellular synchrony was analysed . First , one cell 699 was selected as a centroid of the synchronisation analysis . Then , its neighbouring 700 cells , defined as those located within its sphere ( radius r ) , were extracted . From 701 30 CCA1 - YFP expression signal , phase of the j - th neighbouring cell ( j = 1 , 2 . . , N ) was 702 computed as ( Pikovsky et al . , 2003 ) 703  (cid:3037) (cid:4666)  (cid:4667) = (cid:884)   + t -  (cid:3038)  (cid:3038) + (cid:2869) -  (cid:3038) × (cid:884)  . Here , the k - th peak time t k of the bioluminescence signal was detected by a cosine 704 fitting method ( coefficient of determination larger than 0 . 7 ) using the estimated 705 period  i . Then for each time point , the order parameter R ( t ) ( Kuramoto , 1984 ) was 706 obtained as 707  (cid:4666)  (cid:4667) (cid:1857) Θ = (cid:883) (cid:1840) ∑ (cid:1857) −(cid:3036)   (cid:4666)  (cid:4667)  (cid:3037) = (cid:2869) The order parameter ( 0 < R < 1 ) becomes unity for completely synchronised cells 708 (  1  2  N ) , whereas it becomes zero for non - synchronised cells . Figure 3 - figure 709 supplement 2 shows the results of synchronisation analysis for root tip ( a ) , lower root 710 ( b ) , upper root ( c ) , lower hypocotyl ( d ) , upper hypocotyl ( e ) , and cotyledon ( f ) . For 711 each section , a total of n curves were drawn by selecting individual cells as the 712 centroids ( root tip , n = 242 ; lower root , n = 84 ; upper root , n = 46 ; lower hypocotyl , n 713 = 114 ; upper hypocotyl , n = 53 ; cotyledon , n = 103 ) . By linear regression analysis of 714 each curve , the slope of the order parameter against time was computed , where a 715 positive slope implies that the level of synchrony increases in time due to cell - to - cell 716 interactions . Figure 3 - figure supplement 2h shows the dependence of the slope value 717 on cell density (  r 3 ) . Positive slopes are mostly found in the root tip ( Figure 718 3 - figure supplement 2g ) , with a high correlation to the cell density . 719 720 Next , the coupling strength was estimated for each synchronisation curve { R ( t ) } . 721 Our approach is based upon a simplified version of the technique developed for 722 31 weakly interacting mammalian circadian cells ( Rougemont & Naef , 2007 ) . As a 723 model for the neighbouring cells , we consider a set of coupled phase oscillators 724 (cid:1856)  (cid:3037) (cid:1856)  =  (cid:3037) +  (cid:1840) ∑ sin(cid:4666)  (cid:3038) −  (cid:3037) (cid:4667)  (cid:3038) = (cid:2869) Assuming that the period  j estimated from the j - th cellular trace is not strongly 725 affected by the other cells ( Rougemont & Naef , 2007 ) , the natural angular frequency 726 was set as  j  j for each oscillator . Given an initial condition  j  extracted from 727 the cellular traces , the phase oscillator model was simulated ( Euler method with time 728 step 0 . 1 h ) . Accordingly , the time evolution of the order parameter R ( t ) could be 729 obtained . The coupling strength , which was initially set as K = 0 . 002 , is constant for 730 each simulation . Staring from the minimum level of coupling , the coupling strength 731 was slowly increased so that the phase oscillators are eventually mutually 732 synchronised and the corresponding slope value increases monotonously . At the point 733 when the slope value exceeds the one obtained from the experiment , the 734 corresponding value of K provides the coupling estimate for the experimental data . 735 Figure 3 - figure supplement 2i shows the results . Stronger coupling was estimated for 736 densely populated areas , implying that the cell - to - cell interactions are strengthened 737 when cells are closely located to each other . 738 739 To examine the dependence of the present analysis on the synchrony measure used , 740 the synchronisation index ( Garcia - Ojalvo , Elowitz , Strogatz , 2004 ) was utilized in 741 place of the order parameter . The synchronisation index has the advantage that the 742 noise - sensitive procedure of phase extraction from the cellular traces is not required , 743 since it can be computed directly from the measured signals . For N cellular traces { 744 x j ( t ) : j = 1 , 2 , . . , N } , the averaged signal M ( t ) = ( 1 / N )  j x j ( t ) is computed . Then the 745 synchronisation index is given by 746 32  = (cid:1731)(cid:1839) (cid:2870) (cid:1732) − (cid:1731)(cid:1839)(cid:1732) (cid:2870) (cid:4666)(cid:883) / (cid:1840)(cid:4667) ∑ { (cid:1731)  (cid:3037)(cid:2870) (cid:1732) − (cid:1731)  (cid:3037) (cid:1732) (cid:2870) }  (cid:3037) , where < > denotes time average . In a synchronised cellular state , the averaged signal 747 gives rise to a pronounced amplitude , resulting in R = 1 . The fully desynchronised 748 cellular state , on the other hand , results in R = 0 . To see the time evolution of the level 749 of synchrony , the synchronisation index R ( t ) at time t was computed for windowed 750 time traces of { x j ( s ) : t - 12 < s < t + 12 } ( window : 24h ) . Figure 3 - figure supplement 3 751 shows the analysis results based on the synchronisation index . The panels are ordered 752 in correspondence with those of Figure 3 - figure supplement 2 . Positive slopes are 753 again found in the root tip , implying that the level of synchrony increases in time due 754 to cell - cell interactions . The results are therefore consistent with the ones obtained by 755 the order parameter . 756 757 To examine the dependence of the synchronisation analysis on the particular 758 experimental data set used , the order parameters were computed for the CCA1 - long 759 line . As shown in Figure 3 - figure supplement 4 , the slope of the order parameter for 760 the CCA1 - long line experiment is again well correlated with the cell density , where 761 highly dense cells are located in the root tip . Although the time resolution was three 762 times lower in this experiment , the same tendency was observed . The WT repeat 763 experiment ( Figure 2 - figure supplement 1 ) was not analysed , as the timeseries was 764 too short and time resolution was too low to enable accurate synchronisation analysis . 765 766 Phase oscillator model . We constructed a model where we describe the dynamics of 767 the CCA1 : : CCA1 - YFP in each cell by a simple Kuramoto phase oscillator . For every 768 cell at a position ( m , n ) in the plant ( when viewed in 2D with m denoting position in 769 33 the horizontal direction and n denoting position in the vertical direction ) the phase of 770 the oscillator  (cid:4666)(cid:3040) , (cid:3041)(cid:4667) changes in time ( t ) so that 771   (cid:4666)(cid:3288) , (cid:3289)(cid:4667)   =  (cid:4666)(cid:3040) , (cid:3041)(cid:4667) +  ∑ sin (cid:4666)  (cid:4666)(cid:3043) , (cid:3044)(cid:4667) −  (cid:4666)(cid:3040) , (cid:3041)(cid:4667) (cid:4667) (cid:1731)(cid:3043) . (cid:3044)(cid:1732) . 772 Here  (cid:4666)(cid:3040) , (cid:3041)(cid:4667) describes the intrinsic frequency of the oscillator and the second term 773 describes the oscillator’s dependence on the coupling to the nearest neighbours ( i . e . 774 cells in positions ( p , q ) where p = m - 1 , . . , m + 1 and q = n - 1 , . . . , n + 1 ) with K as the coupling 775 constant . The bioluminescence of each cell is then taken to be  (cid:4666)(cid:3040) , (cid:3041)(cid:4667) (cid:4666)  (cid:4667) = 776 cos (cid:4672)  (cid:4666)(cid:3040) , (cid:3041)(cid:4667) (cid:4666)  (cid:4667)(cid:4673) + (cid:883) . Cells in the plant conform to a template that is taken to be a 777 symmetric shape , and resembles the shape of a seedling . The total bioluminescence 778 across each vertical section ( n ) of the plant is taken to be the sum of the 779 bioluminescence of all cells along that section i . e . ,   (cid:3042)  (cid:3041) (cid:4666)  (cid:4667) = ∑  (cid:4666)(cid:3040) , (cid:3041)(cid:4667) (cid:4666)  (cid:4667)   (cid:3040) = (cid:2869) where 780 the width of the plant counts Nw number of cells . The space - time plot shown in 781 Figure 3k shows the total luminescence normalised so that the peak expression of 782 each vertical section is 1 . 783 784 In the model we assume that the cells in the three sections ( the cotyledon / hypocotyl , 785 the root and the root tip ) have different intrinsic periods , with the cells in the 786 cotyledon and hypocotyl having period of 24h , those in the root having the period of 787 around 25 . 55h and the ones in the root tip a period of 22 . 67h . These overall match the 788 qualitative period differences seen across the different plant sections . In all 789 simulations the coupling constant K is arbitrarily set to 1 . The ODEs are solved using 790 the Euler method . 791 792 34 Data availability .
