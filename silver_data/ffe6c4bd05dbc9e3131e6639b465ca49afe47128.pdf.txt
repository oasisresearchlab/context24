Light is one of the most important resources for plants , and its perception by sensory photoreceptors ( e . g . , phytochromes ) and subsequent transduction into long - term transcriptional reprogramming have been well characterized . Chromatin changes have been shown to be involved in photomorphogenesis . However , the initial short - term transcriptional changes produced by light and what factors enable these rapid changes are not well studied . Here , we deﬁne rapidly light - responsive , Phytochrome Interacting Factor ( PIF ) direct - target genes ( LRP - DTGs ) . We found that a majority of these genes also show rapid changes in Histone 3 Lysine - 9 acetylation ( H3K9ac ) in response to the light signal . Detailed time - course analysis of transcript and chromatin changes showed that , for light - repressed genes , H3K9 deacetylation parallels light - triggered transcriptional repression , while for light - induced genes , H3K9 acetylation appeared to somewhat precede light - activated transcript accumulation . However , direct , real - time imaging of transcript elongation in the nucleus revealed that , in fact , transcriptional induction actually parallels H3K9 acetylation . Collectively , the data raise the possibility that light - induced transcriptional and chromatin - remodeling processes are mechanistically intertwined . Histone modifying proteins involved in long term light responses do not seem to have a role in this fast response , indicating that different factors might act at different stages of the light response . This work not only advances our understanding of plant responses to light , but also unveils a system in which rapid chromatin changes in reaction to an external signal can be studied under natural conditions .

Chromatin Changes in Response to Light INTRODUCTION One of the most drastic changes during plant development is deetiolation , the switch from skotomorphogenesis ( development in the dark ) into photomorphogenesis ( development in the light ) . This change not only implies switching from heterotrophy to autotrophy , but also includes several developmental changes such as reduced hypocotyl elongation , opening of the apical hook and greening of cotyledons ( Schafer and Nagy , 2006 ; Franklin and Quail , 2010 ) . Light signals that trigger deetiolation are perceived by photoreceptors . In Arabidopsis , phytochrome A ( phyA ) and phyB are the main sensors that regulate early photomorphogenesis ( Franklin and Quail , 2010 ) . Upon photoactivation , the active phy is translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus where it physically interacts with Phytochrome Interacting Factors ( PIFs ) , inducing their rapid transphosphorylation , ubiquitination and proteasome - mediated degradation of the phy - PIF complex ( Bauer et al . , 2004 ; Nagatani , 2004 ; Al - Sady et al . , 2006 ; Jiao et al . , 2007 ; Bae and Choi , 2008 ; Pfeiﬀer et al . , 2012 ; Ni et al . , 2013 , 2014 , 2017 ) . PIFs are a subfamily of bHLH transcription factors , comprising eight members in Arabidopsis thaliana . PIF1 , PIF3 , PIF4 , and PIF5 ( known as the “PIF quartet” ) have a central role in maintaining the transcriptional program that underlies skotomorphogenic development ( Leivar et al . , 2008 ; Shin et al . , 2009 ) . The quadruple mutant for these four PIFs ( pifq ) displays a phenotype in total darkness that strongly resembles that of normal light - grown wild - type seedlings ( Leivar et al . , 2008 ; Shin et al . , 2009 ) . To identify PIF - direct target genes ( PIF - DTGs ) , our group analyzed the genome - wide binding proﬁle of each of the PIF quartet members by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation - sequencing ( ChIP - seq ) , and the corresponding transcriptomic proﬁle of dark - grown wild type , pifq , single pif and triple pif mutants , by RNA sequencing ( RNA - seq ; Hornitschek et al . , 2012 ; Zhang et al . , 2013 ; Pfeiﬀer et al . , 2014 ) . Integration of both datasets allowed the identiﬁcation of 338 PIF - DTGs , genes whose promoter region is bound by one or more PIF quartet members at a G - box or PIF Binding Element , and whose transcript levels are misregulated in pifq mutant plants grown in the dark ( Pfeiﬀer et al . , 2014 ) . General transcriptional reprogramming that results in photomorphogenesis , occurs upon light exposure of dark - grown plants , as a consequence of PIF degradation ( Leivar et al . , 2009 ) . There is evidence for antagonistic competition between the PIFs and HY5 for G - box binding in the promoter of the PSY gene during early light - induced expression ( Toledo - Ortiz et al . , 2014 ) . However , the initial dynamics of light - induced transcriptional changes of PIF - DTGs as a whole has not been studied . In eukaryotes , chromatin structure modiﬁcation is a key factor of transcription regulation ( Venkatesh and Workman , 2015 ) . Among the many histone post - translational modiﬁcations , acetylation seems to play a major role in this process ( Jiang et al . , 2020 ) . Histone acetylation , catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases ( HATs ) , has been associated with transcriptional activation , while histone deacetylation by histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) is linked to transcriptional repression ( Pandey et al . , 2002 ) . Whether the role of histone modiﬁcations in transcriptional regulation is causal or consequential is not well understood ( Henikoﬀ and Shilatifard , 2011 ; Morgan and Shilatifard , 2020 ) . Previous research has established that histone acetylation plays an essential role during photomorphogenesis ( Barneche et al . , 2014 ) . Transcriptional regulation and development of light - grown plants is greatly altered in Histone 3 Lysine 9 acetylation ( H3K9ac ) deposition ( HAG1 / GCN5 and HAF2 / TAF1 ) and removal mutants ( HDA19 / HD1 ) ( Bertrand et al . , 2005 ; Benhamed et al . , 2006 ; Guo et al . , 2008 ) . Recent evidence suggests that PIF - exerted transcriptional regulation might be executed by altering the histone modiﬁcation landscape . It has been described that PIF1 and PIF3 directly interact with HDA15 in the dark to repress the expression of germination and chlorophyll biosynthesis genes , respectively ( Liu et al . , 2013 ; Gu et al . , 2017 ) . PIF7 has also been shown to induce H3K9ac deposition on its downstream genes in response to changes in light quality ( Peng et al . , 2018 ; Martínez - García and Moreno - Romero , 2020 ; Willige et al . , 2021 ) . HY5 , a key photomorphogenesis transcription factor also interacts with HDA15 and decreases histone acetylation of genes involved in hypocotyl elongation during photomorphogenesis to repress their expression ( Zhao et al . , 2019 ) . Additionally , phyB has been shown to redundantly control chromatin remodeling to inhibit the transcriptional activation of growth - promoting genes by PIFs ( Kim et al . , 2021 ) . It is still unclear if these factors that control histone acetylation in dark or light - grown plants are also involved in the very initial steps after light exposure that will trigger the photomorphogenesis transcriptional program . Here , to explore the potential role of chromatin remodeling as an intermediary in light - triggered regulation of PIF - DTGs , we focused on H3K9 acetylation as a mark of transcriptionally active genes . We ﬁrst identiﬁed rapid light - responding PIF - DTGs by comparing the transcriptomic proﬁle of dark - grown seedlings with those of dark - grown pifq mutants and dark - grown seedlings after a short red - light treatment . We also proﬁled genome - wide H3K9ac localization in these plants . We found that the majority of light - responsive PIF - DTGs also showed changes in H3K9ac . We then conducted a detailed time - course analysis of mRNA and H3K9ac levels on selected light - responsive PIF - DTGs . This analysis initially suggested that the relationship between H3K9ac and transcription diﬀers in light - repressed and light - induced PIF - DTGs . Real - time transcription initiation imaging , however , suggests instead that H3K9ac also parallels transcriptional induction in response to light . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Identiﬁcation of Rapidly Responding , Light Regulated Phytochrome Interacting Factor - Direct Target Genes In our previous work , we deﬁned PIF - DTGs as genes that are misregulated in pifq mutant plants grown in the dark and whose promoter is bound by any one or more of the PIF quartet proteins [ 209 PIF - induced and 129 PIF - repressed - DTGs ( Pfeiﬀer et al . , 2014 ) ] . In order to identify genes that respond most directly to changes in PIF abundance , we focused on genes whose Frontiers in Plant Science | www . frontiersin . org 2 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 803441 fpls - 13 - 803441 February 12 , 2022 Time : 16 : 33 # 3 González - Grandío et al . Chromatin Changes in Response to Light transcript levels change rapidly in wild - type seedlings after a short exposure to red light , when the PIFs have been almost completely degraded ( Bauer et al . , 2004 ; Shen et al . , 2005 , 2007 ; Lorrain et al . , 2007 ) . For this purpose , we measured genome - wide steady state mRNA levels by RNA - sequencing in “true dark” - grown , wild - type seedlings ( D ) and in “true dark” - grown seedlings treated for 1 h with red light ( R1h ) . We also measured mRNA levels in seedlings grown in continuous white light ( WLc ) as a reference expression proﬁle of plants grown during an extended light regimen ( Figure 1 ) . An initial analysis of R1h and WLc transcriptional proﬁles compared to D showed that the large transcriptional reprogramming occurring in WLc ( 4413 genes are WLc - responsive ) could be triggered by a small number of genes that change rapidly in response to the ﬁrst exposure to light ( 1085 genes are R1h - responsive ) . These genes do not necessarily need to be continuously activated or repressed once the transcriptional reprogramming has been initiated , our data showed that only somewhat over half of the genes ( 58 . 4 % ) that change initially in response to light exposure remain in that state after an extended light regime ( Figure 2 and Supplementary Datasets 1 , 2 ) . We then analyzed the response of previously identiﬁed PIF - DTGs ( Pfeiﬀer et al . , 2014 ) in R1h and WLc . Surprisingly , after R1h , only 19 % PIF - induced PIF - DTGs were repressed , and 15 % of the PIF - repressed PIF - DTGs were induced ( Figure 2 , Supplementary Figure 1 , and Supplementary Datasets 3 , 4 ) . Previously identiﬁed PIF - DTGs that do not change rapidly in response to light could have a slower transcriptional response to PIF degradation , be indirectly regulated by them or could have been misidentiﬁed as PIF - DTGs due to non - functional PIF binding resulting in a lack of transcriptional regulation ( see below ) . These possibilities are non - mutually exclusive and seem to be occurring . Using the WLc data , we could identify slower - responding PIF - regulated genes : 60 % of PIF - induced PIF - DTGs are repressed in R1h , WLc or in both treatments , and 43 % of PIF - repressed PIF - DTGs are induced in R1h , WLc or in both treatments ( Figure 2 ) . Still , some PIF - DTGs do not show altered transcription either after R1h or WLc . Their altered transcriptional levels in pifq mutants grown in the dark could be caused by indirect eﬀects ( they could be downstream targets of PIF - DTGs ) . Additionally , these genes could represent cases where PIF - binding is non - functional and does not result in transcriptional regulation of the gene downstream of the PIF - binding site , as has been reported for other transcription factors in many ChIP - seq experiments ( Biggin , 2011 ) . These results reﬂect the limitation of using transcriptomic proﬁling of constitutive mutants in conjunction with genome wide binding assays to identify transcription factor direct target genes , leading to overestimation of the actual number of direct downstream genes . Complementing these studies with short - term response assays ( in this case R1h ) is essential to narrow down direct targets of transcription factors . In summary , we have identiﬁed PIF - regulated genes whose expression changes very rapidly in response to light . These genes are directly regulated by PIFs and are likely candidates to eﬀect the initial changes downstream of light perception that will trigger the photomorphogenesis developmental plan . For convenience , we will use the term “LRP - DTGs” ( for Light Responsive PIF Direct Target Genes ) from here on to refer to the newly redeﬁned genes that are PIF - DTGs ( bound by PIFs in the dark , have altered mRNA levels in the pifq mutants in the dark ) that respond rapidly to R1h ( Supplementary Dataset 5 ) . Gene ontology enrichment analysis of light - repressed / PIF - induced LRP - DTGs revealed that they are enriched in transcription factors and in proteins known to be involved in red light , far - red light and auxin responses . These genes include IAA19 , IAA29 , PIL1 , PIL2 , and HB2 . Light - induced / PIF - repressed LRP - DTGs were also enriched in proteins known to be involved in far - red , red and blue light responses , including genes such as SPA1 , RPT2 , SIGE , and LHCB2 . 4 . Chromatin Changes Shortly After Red - Light Exposure To investigate the possible involvement of rapid chromatin remodeling in the PIF - exerted regulation of LRP - DTGs , we conducted genome - wide proﬁling of H3K9ac by ChIP - seq in dark - grown wild type and pifq seedlings , and R1h - treated wild type seedlings . We also proﬁled H3K9ac in wild type seedlings grown in WLc for comparison as we did for transcriptome proﬁling ( Figure 1 ) . We chose H3K9ac because it is a histone modiﬁcation that has been shown to be associated with transcriptionally active genes and also involved in long - term transcriptional regulation in continuous white light ( Benhamed et al . , 2006 ; Guo et al . , 2008 ; Gates et al . , 2017 ) . We identiﬁed H3K9ac peaks in all samples , and diﬀerentially quantiﬁed them comparing wt D vs . R1h , wt D vs . wt WLc , and wt D vs . pifq D . We found that the majority of the H3K9ac peaks mapped slightly downstream of the transcriptional start site region irrespective of light treatment , in concordance with previously published results for genome - wide H3K9ac proﬁles ( Supplementary Figure 2 ; Charron et al . , 2009 ) . In dark - grown pifq , 7089 genes had statistically signiﬁcantly higher H3K9ac levels than in wild type , while 900 genes had statistically lower H3K9ac levels ( Supplementary Dataset 6 ) . In WLc samples , 6797 genes had higher H3K9ac levels and 2505 genes had lower levels ( Supplementary Dataset 7 ) . These data are consistent with a change in the chromatin proﬁle associated with photomorphogenic - like development in dark - grown pifq plants , where light - responsive genes become activated in the dark in the absence of the PIF quartet . In fact , clustering analysis revealed that the H3K9ac proﬁle of pifq D is more similar to that of WLc - grown wild type than to dark - grown wild type or R1h - treated ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) . After 1 h of red light , 995 genes had statistically signiﬁcant higher H3K9ac levels than in dark - grown seedlings while 327 genes had lower H3K9ac ( Supplementary Dataset 8 ) . These results indicate that H3K9ac modiﬁcation occurs only in a small fraction of light - regulated genes initially after light - exposure , as is the case for mRNA levels . H3K9ac levels change in a larger number of genes as light - exposure is sustained over longer periods , in a similar fashion to transcriptional changes . In every condition tested , H3K9ac levels generally correlated with mRNA levels ( Pearson’s correlation , r = 0 . 68 for pifq vs . D , r = 0 . 67 for Frontiers in Plant Science | www . frontiersin . org 3 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 803441 fpls - 13 - 803441 February 12 , 2022 Time : 16 : 33 # 4 González - Grandío et al . Chromatin Changes in Response to Light FIGURE 1 | Experimental setup . Wild type or pifq seedlings were grown in “true dark” conditions and treated for 2 days before sample collection and processing for mRNA - or H3K9ac ChIP - sequencing ( see section “Materials and Methods” for detailed experimental procedures ) . FIGURE 2 | A subset of PIF - DTGs are induced or repressed after a short exposure to red light , and a larger set of genes change expression under continuous white light conditions . ( A ) 39 PIF - induced DTGs are repressed after 1 h of red light , and 86 additional genes are repressed in continuous white light , totaling 125 out of 209 PIF - induced DTGs ( 60 % ) . ( B ) 19 PIF - repressed DTGs are induced after 1 h of red light , and 37 additional genes are induced in continuous white light , totaling 56 out of 129 PIF - repressed DTGs ( 43 % ) . Only genes with a statistically signiﬁcant ( FDR < 0 . 05 ) two - fold change in expression under different treatments are compared . PIF - DTGs are deﬁned in Pfeiffer et al . ( 2014 ) as genes whose promoter region is bound by one or more PIF quartet members at a G - box or PIF Binding Element , and whose transcript levels are misregulated in pifq mutant plants grown in the dark . R1h vs . D and r = 0 . 8 for WLc vs . D ) , for genes with a statistically signiﬁcant two - fold ( or greater ) change in mRNA and H3K9ac levels ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) . To explore whether the PIF quartet are involved in the rapid red - light - induced chromatin changes , we focused our analysis of H3K9ac changes in LRP - DTGs in dark - grown pifq mutants , and in R1h - exposed wild type samples . We found that a high proportion of LRP - DTGs undergo H3K9ac changes that are associated with red - light induced PIF degradation ( Figure 3A and Supplementary Dataset 5 , 46 out of 58 LRP - DTGs show H3K9ac changes in either R1h , pifq , or in both ) . In addition , the correlation between H3K9ac and mRNA levels was slightly higher when only LRP - DTGs were considered ( Pearson’s correlation , r = 0 . 68 for pifq vs . D , r = 0 . 81 for R1h vs . D and r = 0 . 86 for WLc vs . D , Supplementary Figure 5 ) . In summary , these results show that H3K9ac changes occur in the majority of LRP - DTGs , in either R1h or pifq , suggesting that it could be a key regulatory factor in their transcriptional regulation . H3K9 Deacetylation Parallels Light - Triggered Transcriptional Repression and Apparently Precedes Transcriptional Induction Given the close parallel between the transcriptional and chromatin responses , we approached the question of whether Frontiers in Plant Science | www . frontiersin . org 4 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 803441 fpls - 13 - 803441 February 12 , 2022 Time : 16 : 33 # 5 González - Grandío et al . Chromatin Changes in Response to Light FIGURE 3 | H3K9ac levels change in light - responsive PIF - DTGs ( LRP - DTGs ) both in pifq and in response to red light .

All the PIF - DTGs that showed statistically signiﬁcant two - fold change in mRNA levels in the same direction in pifq vs . wt and R1h vs . D are shown . Six light - induced / PIF - repressed and six light - repressed / PIF - induced genes for further analyses are highlighted .

( C ) Read mapping proﬁle of H3K9ac ChIP - seq and RNA - seq in PIL1 , a light - repressed LRP - DTG . For each gene , 1000 bp upstream and 250 bp downstream of their representative transcript are shown . Read count is scaled independently for each gene , and for mRNA and H3K9ac levels . RNA - seq data from pifq seedlings and their corresponding wild - type control were obtained from Zhang et al . ( 2013 ) . Note that RNA - seq was performed on 3 (cid:48) - end puriﬁed mRNA . this represents a causal relationship by performing concurrent time - course analysis of the light - induced responses in these two parameters . For this purpose , we selected six PIF - induced / light - repressed LRP - DTGs ( PIL1 , XTR7 , HB2 , CKX5 , IAA19 , and At5g02580 ) and six PIF - repressed / light - induced LRP - DTGs ( RPT2 , SIGE , LNK3 , SPA1 , BOH2 , and At1g60590 ) , based on the extent of their changes in mRNA and H3K9ac levels in the genome - wide experiments , and on their potential key roles in red - light responsiveness based on their molecular function ( Figures 3B , C , Supplementary Figure 6 , and Supplementary Table 1 ) . We ﬁrst conﬁrmed the results of the genome - wide analysis by measuring changes in H3K9ac levels in these 12 genes in response to R1h by ChIP - qPCR ( Supplementary Figure 7 ) . We then performed a detailed time - course analysis of the rapid changes in mRNA and H3K9ac levels over the 1 - h period following initial light exposure . We measured both parameters by RT - qPCR and ChIP - qPCR in the 12 selected LRP - DTGs after a saturating red - light pulse . Highly variable mRNA and H3K9ac levels at the CKX5 locus precluded any ﬁrm conclusions for this gene ( Supplementary Figure 8 ) . In broad terms , H3K9ac and mRNA levels were correlated ( Supplementary Figure 9 , Pearson’s correlation , r = 0 . 81 ) . A more detailed analysis showed that most of the PIF - induced / light - repressed LRP - DTGs display rapid decreases in H3K9ac levels in response to red - light treatment , in parallel with the decrease in mRNA levels , declining sharply 5 min after the red - light pulse ( Figures 4A , B ) . A converse pattern can be seen for the PIF - repressed / light - induced LRP - DTGs , where an increase in both mRNA and H3K9ac levels is detected shortly after red - light exposure ( Figures 4C , D ) . However , in this case H3K9ac increase seems to occur earlier than mRNA induction , with detectable H3K9ac changes occurring around 10 min after the red - light pulse , while the mRNA increase happens 20 min after the red - light pulse ( Figures 4B , D and Supplementary Figure 10 ) . These results suggest that H3K9ac deposition is necessary to initiate transcription , while its removal instantly triggers a reduction in steady state mRNA levels . It is also possible that this observed delay in transcription is caused by the fact that we are measuring steady - state levels of processed mRNA by RT - qPCR , and while this technique accurately measures mature mRNA levels of genes expressed in the dark ( i . e . , light - repressed LRP - DTGs ) , it might not capture the exact moment of light - induced LRP - DTGs transcriptional initiation . Real - Time Transcription Imaging Reveals an Earlier Timing of Light - Induced Transcription Initiation In order to accurately measure a more continuous transcriptional readout and pinpoint the exact time of transcription initiation in response to light we generated several reporter lines . We ﬁrst tested if we were able to recapitulate light - induced transcriptional initiation in transgenic lines expressing luciferase under the control of the RPT2 promoter , a light - induced LRP - DTG ( pRPT2 : LUC lines ) . We chose pRPT2 as it showed a strong and robust response to light in all our previous experiments . However , we were not able to detect any signiﬁcant change in luminescence between pRPT2 : LUC lines grown in the dark and after R1h treatment ( Supplementary Figure 11A ) . This absence of response was not due to pRPT2 lacking light / PIF responsive elements , as we could detect a large luminescence Frontiers in Plant Science | www . frontiersin . org 5 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 803441 fpls - 13 - 803441 February 12 , 2022 Time : 16 : 33 # 6 González - Grandío et al . Chromatin Changes in Response to Light FIGURE 4 | H3K9ac changes in LRP - DTGs parallel the rapid transcriptional response in light - repressed LRP - DTGs , and apparently precede transcription in light - induced LRP - DTGs . H3K9ac and mRNA changes measured by ChIP - qPCR and RT - qPCR in light - repressed ( A ) and light - induced ( C ) LRP - DTGs after a saturating red - light pulse . Averaged mRNA and H3K9ac levels for each group of genes are shown in ( B , D ) , respectively . Data were re - scaled to the minimum and maximum mRNA / H3K9ac values for each gene . Each colored line represents the averaged mRNA / H3K9ac levels at each time point and the shaded band represents the standard error of the mean ( n = 3 ) . increase when we transformed this reporter into pifq background ( Supplementary Figure 11B ) . It is likely that protein reporters that require transcription and translation in order to be measurable are not able to capture these short - term responses . We then generated reporter lines in which we could measure mRNA transcription in real time ( Supplementary Figure 12 ) . The RPT2 promoter was used to drive transcription of a mRNA tagged in its 5 (cid:48) with a PP7 sequence recognized by a co - expressed GFP - tagged PP7 phage coat protein , enabling identiﬁcation of nascent mRNA as ﬂuorescent puncta ( pRPT2 : PP7 – Supplementary Figure 12 ; Larson et al . , 2011 ; Alamos et al . , 2021 ) . Imaging of dark - grown pRPT2 : PP7 lines exposed to light was able to recapitulate light - induced transcriptional initiation ( Figure 5A ) . We measured real - time mRNA production in four independent pRPT2 : PP7 transgenic lines and we observed that transcription begins approximately 10 min after light exposure , slightly earlier than the increase in steady - state RPT2 mRNA levels we detected by RT - qPCR ( Figure 5B ) . The timing of transcription initiation coincides with the increase in H3K9ac levels observed by ChIP - qPCR ( Figure 4C ) . Together , these results suggest that transcription initiation is accompanied by H3K9 acetylation , and within the time resolution limitations of our experiments , could indicate that they are intertwined processes . Development of more advanced techniques that measure chromatin changes with higher spatiotemporal resolution is required to better understand its relationship with transcriptional control . H3K9ac Writers and Erasers Involved in Long - Term Light Responses Do Not Participate in Global Fast Transcriptional Changes in Response to Light It has been previously reported that the transcriptional program of light - grown plants is disrupted in mutants for H3K9ac deposition ( HAG1 / GCN5 and HAF2 / TAF1 ) and removal ( HDA19 / HD1 ) ( Bertrand et al . , 2005 ; Benhamed et al . , 2006 ; Guo et al . , 2008 ) . To test the possibility that these H3K9ac writer or eraser proteins could be involved in gene regulation shortly after initial light - exposure , we measured mRNA levels of the 12 selected LRP - DTGs in dark - grown and R1h - treated hag1 , haf2 , and hda19 mutants . Contrary to what happens to other light - related genes in light - grown seedlings of these mutants , LRP - DTGs expression remained generally unaltered after a short red - light treatment . Although some mutants display a slight variation in R1h response when compared to the wild - type response , we only detected a completely R1h - insensitive responses on a few LRP - DTGs ( At1g60590 , LNK3 , and BOH2 ) , and only in the hag1 mutants compared to wild type ( Figure 6 ) . These results indicate that HAF2 and HDA19 proteins , that are Frontiers in Plant Science | www . frontiersin . org 6 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 803441 fpls - 13 - 803441 February 12 , 2022 Time : 16 : 33 # 7 González - Grandío et al .

HAG1 seems to control expression of only a small subset of LRP - DTGs .

Chromatin Changes in Response to Light possible explanation is that because of functional redundancy of histone modiﬁers ( Pandey et al . , 2002 ) , mutation in a single family member is not suﬃcient to aﬀect the LRP - DTGs rapid transcriptional response to light . It remains to be explored which other possible factors might be responsible for the quick changes in H3K9ac in response to light exposure . CONCLUSION The aim of the present study was to identify key genes that respond in the ﬁrst instance to the ﬁrst light exposure in plants , and understand the factors involved in their regulation . To do this , we focused on the red - light phytochrome signaling pathway . For this purpose , we focused on known PIF direct - target genes . We found that only a subset of the previously described PIF - DTGs respond most rapidly to light exposure . We redeﬁned them as LRP - DTGs . These genes probably are the most direct targets of PIF regulation and play a key role in photomorphogenesis initiation . We found that the majority of these genes also show very rapid changes in H3K9ac levels , that accompany their transcriptional response , in the very initial minutes after light exposure . These ﬁndings suggest that chromatin remodeling is mechanistically linked to the very initial light response of these genes . The fact that H3K9ac is present in repressed genes , albeit at low levels , raises an interesting hypothesis : do basal H3K9ac levels prime speciﬁc genes so they can rapidly respond to changing light conditions ? More precise chromatin state measuring techniques coupled with chromatin state - altering treatments are required to characterize these changes . This study contributes to our understanding of transcriptional regulation in response to environmental changes , and describes a system in which chromatin dynamics in response to environmental cues can be analyzed . The precise mechanism of how these histone modiﬁcations are performed and how they interact with other factors to orchestrate this response remain to be elucidated . MATERIALS AND METHODS Plant Materials and Growth Conditions The Columbia - 0 ecotype of Arabidopsis thaliana was used for all experiments . pif1pif3pif4pif5 ( pifq ) line is described in Leivar et al . ( 2008 ) , hag1 - 5 ( SALK _ 048427 ) in Kornet and Scheres ( 2009 ) , haf2 - 5 ( SAIL _ 548 _ G03 ) in Lee and Seo ( 2018 ) , and hda19 - 4 ( SALK _ 139443 ) in Kim et al . ( 2008 ) . To generate pRPT2 : LUC lines , 3342 bp upstream of the RPT2 start codon were ampliﬁed by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) with primers Bam HI - pRPT2 - 5 / pRPT2 - 3 - Pst I and cloned into the pC1302 - 35S : RLUC vector ( Zhang et al . , 2013 ) . To generate pRPT2 : PP7 lines , 3356 bp upstream of the RPT2 start codon were ampliﬁed by PCR with primers 13Rb - RPT2F and 13Rb - RPT2R and cloned into the AL13Rb plasmid ( Addgene # 161006 ) ( Alamos et al . , 2021 ) . Primers are described in Supplementary Dataset 9 . Constructs were transformed into Arabidopsis by the ﬂoral dip method ( Clough and Bent , 1998 ) . Plants were germinated in true - dark conditions as described in Leivar et al . ( 2008 ) . Brieﬂy , seeds were sterilized , plated in MS medium without sucrose under white light and stratiﬁed for 4 days at 4 ◦ C in darkness . Afterward , they were irradiated for 3 h with white light to induce germination , followed by a saturating 5 min far - red light pulse . They were grown in the dark at 21 ◦ C for 2 days before being collected ( D samples ) or grown in the dark for 47 h and treated with 10 µ E · m − 2 · s − 1 red light for 1 h ( R1h samples ) . White - light grown samples ( WLc ) were grown under continuous white - light ( 100 µ E · m − 2 · s − 1 PAR ) after stratiﬁcation for 2 days . For the time - course experiments , a saturating red - light pulse ( 5000 µ E in 1 min ) was given after 2 days in the dark and samples were collected at the indicated time - points . RNA Sequencing Total RNA from 2 - day old “true dark” - grown ( D ) , R1h and WLc treated seedlings was extracted and processed as described in Zhang et al . ( 2013 ) . RNA was extracted from 100 mg of ground tissue using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit ( Qiagen cat . 74904 ) using RNase - Free DNase ( Qiagen cat . 79254 ) following manufacturer instructions . The sequencing library construction was adapted from 3 (cid:48) - end RNA - seq protocol ( Yoon and Brem , 2010 ) and performed as described in Zhang et al . ( 2013 ) . The size of puriﬁed library DNA was validated by Bioanalyzer 2000 . Libraries were assayed by 50 - cycle single - end sequencing on the HiSeq 2000 platform . Sequencing reads were aligned to the TAIR9 representative transcriptome using Bowtie ( Langmead et al . , 2009 ) with zero mismatches allowed . Only reads mapping uniquely to the 3 (cid:48) - end 500 - bp region of the coding strand were counted for gene expression . Diﬀerentially expressed genes were identiﬁed using the edgeR package ( Robinson et al . , 2010 ) , and genes with statistically signiﬁcant two - fold ( or greater ) mRNA changes were deﬁned as those that diﬀer by ≥ 2 - fold with an adjusted P value ≤ 0 . 05 . Sequencing data have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus ( Edgar et al . , 2002 ) and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE181167 . Previously published sequencing data can be accessed through GEO Series accession number GSE39217 . Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and Sequencing For each replicate , 2 . 5 gr of 2 - day old wild - type and pifq D , R1h and WLc treated seedlings were processed as described in Gendrel et al . ( 2005 ) using 5 µ gr Diagenode Ab C15410004 H3K9ac antibody and a mix of 25 / 25 µ l of protein - A / G Dynabeads ( Invitrogen ) . Samples were collected and processed under a green safelight . 5 – 10 ng of DNA per sample were used for library preparation with Accel - NGS 2S Plus DNA Library Kit ( Swift Biosciences ) and 9 PCR cycles . 300 – 700 bp fragments were puriﬁed and sequenced in an Illumina HiSeq 4000 by SR50 Single Read Sequencing . Reads were aligned to Arabidopsis thaliana TAIR9 reference genome using Bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg , 2012 ) . H3K9ac enriched regions were identiﬁed using the BayesPeak algorithm with lower - bound summarization method ( Spyrou et al . , 2009 ) . Diﬀerential enrichment analysis was performed with DiﬀBind ( Stark and Brown , 2011 ) , comparing Frontiers in Plant Science | www . frontiersin . org 8 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 803441 fpls - 13 - 803441 February 12 , 2022 Time : 16 : 33 # 9 González - Grandío et al . Chromatin Changes in Response to Light H3K9ac enrichment in these regions among diﬀerent samples . Only peaks with statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerent levels with an FDR ≤ 0 . 05 were used in the analysis . Each peak was assigned to the gene with the nearest transcriptional start site using the TAIR9 gene annotation . Sequencing data have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus ( Edgar et al . , 2002 ) and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE181432 . Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Time - Course Due to the time - sensitive nature of the time course experiment , crosslinking time was reduced to 5 min . Additionally , due to the impossibility to process 27 samples simultaneously , to reduce sample - batch variability as much as possible , we collected samples in batches of three always collecting three diﬀerent randomized time points each day . We prepared the samples ( sowing the seeds and true - dark treatment ) and collected them at the same time of the day to avoid any circadian clock eﬀect . Reverse Transcription Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction Total RNA was extracted from 100 mg of dark grown or R1h treated seedlings per biological replicate , and three biological replicates were used per time point using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit ( Qiagen cat . 74904 ) with RNase - Free DNase ( Qiagen cat . 79254 ) following manufacturer instructions . One µ gr of RNA was used to make cDNA with the High - Capacity cDNA archive kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc cat . 4368814 ) . qPCR reactions were performed with SYBR Green Master Mix ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc cat . 4309155 ) using three technical replicates per reaction in a CFX96 Touch Real - Time PCR Detection System ( Bio - Rad ) . TUBULIN1 was used as a reference for ChIP - qPCR experiments and PP2AA3 for RT - qPCR ( Czechowski et al . , 2005 ) . Primers are described in Supplementary Dataset 9 . Luciferase Assays Approximately 100 mg of 2 - day old seedlings were collected and ground in liquid nitrogen . Total protein was extracted using 100 µ l of Passive Lysis Buﬀer ( Promega ) . Twenty microliters of the supernatant were used to measure the LUC and RLUC activity using a Dual - Luciferase Reporter Assay System ( Promega ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions in a Tecan M - 100PRO plate reader . Fireﬂy luminescence was normalized by the constitutively expressed Renilla luciferase internal control . Real - Time Transcription Imaging Image acquisition and analysis was performed as described in Alamos et al . ( 2021 ) . Estimation of mRNA production was calculated as described in Garcia et al . ( 2013 ) and Alamos et al . ( 2021 ) . The Leica SP8 microscope was operated using the LASX software in manual mode . Data was taken at a constant laser power for the 488 nm laser and the 569 nm laser throughout the duration of a single time course experiment and across experiments . No auto correction or manipulation was done during acquisition , except for adjustment of the z position due to sample drift . Each channel - GFP and mScarlet - was acquired using a diﬀerent HyD detector and treated independently throughout the downstream analysis . The imaging setup was as follows : 63 × magniﬁcation ; zoom 2 ; image size 1024 × 512 × 25 z slices ; pixel xy size 90 nm ; z slice depth 500 nm ; bidirectional scanning at 300 Hz ; pinhole 1 airy unit at 500 nm ; no frame or line average ; no frame accumulation , line accumulation 3 ; 488 nm at ∼ 5 % laser power ( calibrated to µ W ) and 569 nm at 1 . 5 % laser power , frame rate 1 min / stack .
