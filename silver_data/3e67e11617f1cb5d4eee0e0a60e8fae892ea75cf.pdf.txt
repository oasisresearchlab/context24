Abstract 18 Introduction : Group musical activities using wind instruments have been restricted during the 19 CoVID19 pandemic due to suspected higher risk of virus transmission . It was presumed that the 20 aerosols exhaled through the tubes while playing would be ejected over larger distances and spread 21 into the room due to jet stream effects . In particular , the soprano recorder is widely used as 22 instrument in school classes and for beginners of all age groups in their musical education , as well as 23 in contexts of leisure activities and in professional concert performances . 24 Understanding the aerosol impulse dispersion characteristics of playing the soprano recorder could 25 assist with the establishment of concepts for safe music - making . 26 Methods : Five adult professionally trained soprano recorder players ( 4 female , 1 male ) played four 27 bars of the main theme of L . van Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy” in low and in high octaves , as well as with 28 3 different potential protection devices in the high octave . For comparison they spoke the 29 corresponding text by F . Schiller . Before each task , they inhaled . 5 L of vapor from an e - cigarette 30 filled with base liquid . The vapor cloud escaping during speaking or playing was recorded by cameras 31 and its spread was measured as a function of time in the three spatial dimensions . The potential 32 safety devices were rated in practicability with a questionnaire , and their influence on the sound was 33 compared , generating a long - term average spectrum from the audio data . 34 Results : When playing in the high octave , at the end of the task the clouds showed a median 35 distance of 1 . 06 m to the front and . 57 m diameter laterally ( maxima : x : 1 . 35 m and y : . 97 m ) . 36 It was found that the clouds’ expansion values in playing the recorder with and without safety 37 measures are mostly lower when compared to the ordinary , raised speaking voice of the same 38 subjects . 39 The safety devices which covered the instrument did not show clear advantages and were rated as 40 unpractical by the subjects . The most effective reduction of the cloud was reached when playing into 41 a suction funnel . 42 Conclusion : The aerosol dispersion characteristics of soprano recorders seem comparable to 43 clarinets . The tested safety devices which covered holes of the instrument did not show clear 44 benefits . 45 .

The combination of jet stream effects , 49 accumulation of exhaled particles and group gatherings led to the closing of concert halls , as well as 50 the prohibition of musical events , rehearsals , and music lessons in schools 3 . Therefore , institutions in 51 which playing a wind instrument plays an important role , such as theatres , concert halls , schools , 52 music schools and music universities had to invent safety concepts to be able to maintain musical 53 activities . These concepts often included frequent disinfection of the room , frequent aeration and 54 distancing or even teaching completely online , as well as covering the instruments with masks or 55 fabrics 4 – 10 . In order to provide helpful information for the development of such concepts , several 56 studies tried to figure out if wind instruments were increasing the infection risks due to both aerosol 57 generation and dispersion , or if the instruments were decreasing the risks by capturing the 58 condensed aerosols inside the instruments . While a study on vuvuzelas , which are straight narrow 59 tubes comparable to recorders , showed the ejection of much higher amounts of aerosols than in 60 shouting 11 , a more recent study found smaller aerosol expulsion from classical wind instruments 61 compared to vocalization 12 . Another study divided various orchestral wind instruments into different 62 risk categories by their aerosol emissions 13 . They found flutes and clarinets , which resemble the 63 recorder in mechanism and shape , respectively , to be only at intermediate transmission risk , while 64 trumpet and oboe belonged to the high - risk category . In contrast , a study analyzing the impulse 65 dispersion of aerosols ranked the flute to be more risky than clarinet and trumpet , due to the larger 66 distances reached by the aerosols 14 . A study by Stockman et al . 15 found comparable amounts of 67 airborne particles in clarinets and singing , as well as effective reduction of aerosol concentration and 68 dispersion by surgical masks . Nevertheless , their results showed high unsteadiness and situation - 69 dependent variations in the concentrations and dispersions of the emitted vapor clouds . 70 All these studies concentrated on a variety of orchestral instruments , while the recorder , which is a 71 common instrument for musical education and leisure activity in children and adult amateurs as well 72 as professional musicians , has , to the best of the authors’ knowledge , not been addressed , and it 73 could be speculated that the results of other studies cannot be transferred simply . Referring to a 74 representative study on amateur music in Germany , the recorder is played by 22 % of female and 3 % 75 of male amateur musicians aged 16 + . In children aged 6 - 15 , 96 % play an instrument , with the 76 recorder found in the second place by popularity , being played by 24 % of these children 16 . The 77 soprano recorder is , furthermore , used in music classes of public schools all over the world for its 78 .

It also evaluates several protective devices that had been invented 83 with the expectation of decreasing the radius of aerosol dispersion . 84 .

None of the subjects showed 87 respiratory problems in their respective medical histories and spirometry ( ZAN , Inspire Healthcare , 88 Oberthulba , Germany ) . There were no signs of acute infection based on their answers to an acute 89 infection questionnaire . 90 Tasks and setup : 91 In the experiment , the subjects performed six tasks ( for access to Figure 1 please contact the 92 corresponding author ) : 93 1 . Speaking the sentence “Freude schöner Götterfunken , Tochter aus Elisium” ( “Ode to joy” by 94 Friedrich Schiller ( used also by Beethoven in his ninth symphony , 4 th movement ) ) with raised 95 voice . 96 2 . Loudly playing four bars of the melody of the “Ode to joy” by Ludwig van Beethoven in their 97 lower octave , starting from F # 5 ( fundamental frequency ( f o ) approx . 740 Hz ) . The speed was 98 set as approx . 120 bpm . 99 3 . Loudly playing the same melody in their higher octave , starting from F # 6 ( f o approx . 100 1475 Hz ) . 101 4 . Playing the same melody in their higher octave with a specially designed extended cloth - 102 mask that covered the player’s mouth and nose and the entire instrument ( material : 103 200g / m2 cotton molton ) , as well as a cover tissue for the bell hole called “Plopp - Schutz” 104 ( ©Bonner Textilmanufaktur 17 ) . 105 5 . Playing the melody in the higher octave , the bell hole covered with household paper towel , 106 as suggested by Bauhaus - Universität Weimar 5 . 107 6 . Playing the above - mentioned melody in the higher octave into a suction funnel ( diameter at 108 the inlet : . 6 m , diameter at the outlet : . 1 m , length . 45 m , extended by a pipe of 1 m ; 109 operated by a usual axial fan obtained from IT hardware ) . 110 Each task lasted approximately 8 seconds . Before the subjects started the tasks , they inhaled . 5 l 111 vapor from the basic liquid through a Lynden Vox e - cigarette ( Lynden GmbH ) . The basic liquid 112 consists of 50 % glycerin and 50 % polypropylene glycol . The aerosols in the e - cigarette vapor have 113 the size in the range of 250 - 450 nm , which approximately matches the size of aerosols generated by 114 human expiration 18 . A spirometer ( ZAN , Inspire Healthcare , Oberthulba , Germany ) was mounted on 115 top of the e - cigarette to measurethe volume of the vapor inhaled by the subject . 116 .

They were asked to avoid any motion after finishing the tasks . As in previous 118 experiments 14 , 19 – 23 , the measurements were conducted in a Bavarian Television Broadcasting Studio 119 with the dimensions of 27 m x 22 m x 9 m . Three synchronized high - definition television cameras 120 ( Sony , Tokio , Japan , resolution 1920 × 1080 pixels , 25 fps ) recorded the tasks from a side view ( C1 ) , a 121 front view ( C2 ) and a top view ( C3 ) . The studio was aerated before and after each task with opposed 122 doors open for a minimum of 2 minutes . The room had a constant humidity of 29 . 8 % and a constant 123 temperature of 21 . 0°C . Three spotlights illuminated the white aerosol clouds against the black studio 124 walls . For the conversion of pixels into metric values in the data processing , 3 metric scaling bars 125 were installed at the performance stage to cover all 3 spatial directions . 126 Data analysis 127 Similar to previous experiments 14 , 19 – 23 , the video footage was converted into negative black and 128 white . The subjects were asked to wear black clothes . However , some uncovered parts of the human 129 body like hands or faces were masked to avoid segmentation errors . The expansions of the expelled 130 aerosol clouds were segmented in each video frame using the software Glottis Analysis Tools 131 ( University Erlangen - Nürnberg , Germany ) 24 . The footage of C2 had to be excluded from further 132 analysis due to light reflections which led to artifacts in the segmentation process . The footage of C1 133 was used to measure the maximum expansion to the subjects’ front ( x - direction ) and in maximum 134 positive and negative vertical direction ( z - direction ) . The footage of C3 provided the side expansion 135 of the aerosol clouds ( for access to Figure 2 please contact the corresponding author ) . The position 136 of the mouth was set as starting point of the aerosol cloud dispersion . 137 For the temporal representation of the clouds’ dispersion , the time point zero was defined as the 138 end of a task ( 0 point in the time domain ) , i . e . , where phonation or playing stopped . Consecutively , 139 the start of the task had negative values in the time domain . 140 The temporal devolution of the maximum dispersion in each direction was filtered by a moving 141 median filter ( window length of 30 time points ) for each player and subsequently smoothed by a 142 cubic spline interpolation in order to remove segmentation outliers , both steps carried out in Matlab 143 ( The Mathworks Inc . , Natick , MA ) . 144 In task 6 ( suction funnel ) , the pipe’s end was not connected to a longer tube which would guide the 145 vapor outside of the room so that the vapor was released into the studio . However , this released 146 cloud was not considered in the segmentation as it was clearly distinguishable from the clouds 147 directly originating from the player and / or the recorder . 148 .

The 151 microphone was connected to the computer via a Scarlett 2i2 audio interface ( Focusrite Plc , High 152 Wycombe , England ) . The audio signal was then sampled with the software Audacity26 ( MuseCY SM 153 Ltd , Limassol , Cyprus ) at a sampling rate of 44 . 1 kHz . The melody was performed ( 1 ) with each of the 154 potential safety devices and ( 2 ) without any . From the audio recordings , Long Term Average Spectra 155 ( LTAS ) were obtained using the software Wavesurfer ( version 1 . 8 . 8 , Centre for Speech Technology , 156 KTH Stockholm ; settings : FFT : Hanning , 512 points , range : - 110 dB ) , in order to detect changes in the 157 spectral characteristic of the instrument’s sound caused by the safety measures . 158 Subjective evaluation of the potential safety device 159 The subjects also answered a questionnaire consisting of visual analogue scales ( 0 - 100 mm ) with 160 statements on the freedom of movement , sound attenuation , inhalation sufficiency , and concert 161 practicability to subjectively evaluate the application of the analyzed safety devices , see supplement . 162 163 Due to the small number of subjects , statistical calculations were considered not meaningful . 164 .

The vapor escaped the instrument 166 mainly through the labium and the bell hole and merged into one cloud . 167 At the end of the speaking task , the maximum expansion of the aerosol clouds reached 1 . 32 m to the 168 front , with a median of . 83 m . The dispersion at the end of the task for playing the recorder in the 169 low and the high octave exhibited maximum values comparable to speaking , i . e . , in a range of 170 ± . 1 m , with slightly higher median values to the front ( T2 : 0 . 97 m ; T3 : 1 . 06 m ) , see table 1 . 171 The side expansion of the clouds from speaking at the end of the task showed a maximum diameter 172 of 1 . 16 m with a median of . 84 m . All values of the aerosol clouds’ lateral expansions during playing 173 the recorder in high and low octave were lower than in speaking ( table 1 ) . 174 175 At the time points 3 and 10 seconds after the end of the task , the clouds’ expansions from playing 176 the recorder were found below all compared values of the speaking task . A maximum expansion to 177 the front of 2 . 17 m was reached by one subject 10 seconds after playing in the high octave , which is 178 still . 41 m below the maximum value 10 seconds after speaking ( 2 . 58m ) . 179 A maximum side expansion diameter of 1 . 14 m was reached 10 seconds after playing in the low 180 octave , which is . 48 m below the maximum value 10 seconds after speaking ( 1 . 62 m ) . 181 Figure 3 shows the dispersion for all subjects’ tasks 2 and 3 and the corresponding medians . 182 183 All safety devices influenced the dispersion patterns during playing the recorder when compared to 184 task 3 , i . e . , playing in the high octave without safety device . 185 When playing with the mask and bell hole cover ( T4 ) , the median in x - direction to the front at the 186 end of the task was . 41 m below the compared value for task 3 and stayed below the median values 187 for the later time points . 188 The maximum value to the front at the end of the task was comparable to T3 and 10 seconds later 189 the maximum exceeded the compared value of T3 by . 11 m . 190 With regard to the lateral expansion at the end of the task , the median diameters of T3 and T4 were 191 comparable . The maximum value for T4 at the end of the task was . 19 m lower than in T3 ( table I ) . 192 193 For task 5 , i . e . , applying the paper towel during playing , the median values to the front were higher 194 than in T3 , while the maxima were below the compared values , but only . 04 m lower at the end of 195 the task . 196 .

All values to the sides at later time points were higher 198 than in the compared task T3 , reaching a largest diameter of 1 . 29 m after 10 seconds . 199 200 All listed values in task 6 with the suction funnel were below the values of T3 ( table I ) . 201 Figure 4 provides the medians for the safety devices in comparison to normal playing in low and high 202 octave . 203 Regarding the vertical direction , playing in the low octave reached the highest maxima upwards 204 from the subject’s mouth with 1 . 7 m at the end of the task and 1 . 91 m at time point 10 s . 205 The highest median values of all tasks in positive z - direction ( upwards ) were reached when playing 206 with mask and bell hole tissue , showing . 9 m at the end of the task and 1 . 04 m at time point 10 s . 207 208 Evaluation of safety devices 209 The long - term average spectrum of playing in the high octave without device ( pure ) and with the 210 mask or tissue or paper towel is depicted in Figure 5 . No significant attenuations or deviations were 211 observed . The mean squared errors are 4 . 7 for the extended mask , 2 . 77 for the bell hole tissue and 5 212 for the paper towel . 213 214 Figure 6 shows the results of the questionnaires concerning mask , tissue , and paper towel . The 215 perception of sound attenuation was reported for all of the safety devices , but least for the bell hole 216 tissue . For the paper towel , it was shown that the covering of the bell hole prohibited the production 217 of low pitches where all fingers close their assigned hole . Especially for the mask , the musicians 218 reported problems in sufficient inhalation and restriction of movement . All the subjects rejected the 219 application of masks for use in concerts . All except one musician rejected the paper towel . The tissue 220 was rated as practicable in concerts by three of the five subjects . 221 .

In general , it was found that the impulse dispersion characteristics 224 were comparable to those of the clarinets 14 but not flutes , and that a suction funnel can reduce the 225 aerosol dispersion significantly , while other devices covering the instrument were problematic 226 concerning the aerosol dispersion and / or practical implementation . 227 228 Group musical activities were restricted in many countries during the Covid19 pandemic , due to the 229 estimated higher risk of virus transmission in playing wind instruments 1 , 2 . The risk is assumed to be 230 higher due to jet streams through narrow instruments , as well as accumulation and suspension of 231 aerosols in rooms with group gathering . 232 Aerosol emission rates and impulse dispersion of several orchestra instruments have already been 233 investigated in previous studies 11 - 15 ; however , none of these studies included the recorder , which is a 234 very common instrument , not only in professional settings but also in music education and amateur 235 music - making . Understanding the dispersion characteristics could help in risk management and 236 adjustment of safety concepts . 237 When playing in the high octave , at the end of the task , the clouds showed medians of 1 . 06 m to the 238 front ( x - direction ) and . 57 m diameter laterally ( y - direction ) , with maxima of x : 1 . 35 m and y : . 97 m ) . 239 Compared to the dispersion values of other instruments in a previous study with the same 240 experimental setup 14 , without safety device at the end of the task , the straight - built recorder 241 produced larger distances than the winding - built trumpet ( the trumpet values were medians : x : . 86 242 m and y : . 3 m ; maxima : x : 1 . 20 m and y : . 52 m ) . Even though the mechanism of the recorder is 243 somewhat similar to the flute , dividing the airflow from the windway above the block at the labium , 244 the generated jet stream of aerosols did not go as far as for the flutes ( flutes’ medians : x : 1 . 51 m , y : 245 . 64 m ; maxima : x : 1 . 88 m , y : 1 . 23 m ) . The values of the recorder were rather comparable to the 246 shape - resembling clarinet ( medians x : 1 m , y : . 55 m ; maxima x : 1 . 51 m , y : . 95 m ) . 247 248 Similar to the clarinets in the previous study 14 , the clouds’ frontal expansions of the recorders 249 generally stagnated or decreased after the end of the task at a distance of around 1 m . For a single 250 subject the cloud continued to expand and reached a maximum distance of 2 . 17 m to the front , 10 251 seconds after playing in the high octave , which exceeds former recommendations of a safety 252 distance of 2 m to the front for wind instruments in general . Accordingly , the lateral expansions 253 decreased after the end of the task and increased for one subject after playing in the low octave , 254 .

Considering the 255 individually different expansion dimensions of each cloud after the end of the task ( see for example 256 fig . 3 : T3 in x - direction ) , it seems likely that , after the primary impulse , multifactorial influences such 257 as convectional flows or temperature differences make the diffusion of the clouds hardly calculable 258 and consequently questionable . 259 It must be taken into account that this study measured only trained , adult recorder players playing 260 loudly , and that children and amateurs might have less exhalation power and playing at moderate 261 volume was not examined . This might influence the distance of the impulse dispersion . 262 263 It should also be noted here that the aerosol dispersion reflects only a part of the potential virus 264 transmission pathway which includes ( 1 ) the aerosol generation , ( 2 ) the aerosol dispersion , ( 3 ) the 265 accumulation in closed rooms , and ( 4 ) the inhalation of aerosols by the recipient 25 . No aerosol 266 concentrations were measured in the presented study . However , the mechanism and construction 267 of the recorder could be assumed comparable to flutes and clarinets . Consequently , in application of 268 the data by He et al . 26 also the recorder could be classified into an intermediate risk category . 269 However , this assumption should be verified in future investigations . 270 271 The installation of the extended mask and bell hole tissue , covering all holes of the instrument , did 272 not show a clear pattern in comparison to the task without mask ( T3 ) , with values evenly distributed 273 to higher , lower , and comparable categories . Although the median values to the front were lower 274 with the safety procedure , the maxima were higher , reaching 2 . 28 m after ten seconds 275 demonstrating a greater variance among all measurements . 276 Playing with a paper towel closing the bell hole tightly showed many values that were even higher 277 than without it , i . e . , 9 out of 12 values in x - and y direction ( see table I ) . This might be due to 278 pressure - supercompensation to the perceived resistance at the end of the tube , augmenting the jet 279 stream at the narrow labium . The maximum side diameter of the cloud reached 1 . 29 m 10 seconds 280 after the end of the task . Consequently , a covering of the bell hole without covering the labium is 281 considered worse than playing without any device . 282 The suction funnel was the only safety installation that showed convincing effects in all directions at 283 all time points . However , the device needs significant technical effort to be installed correctly while 284 producing as little noise as possible so as not to disturb the music , which could make teachers and 285 institutions hesitant . 286 287 .

The 288 single exception was for the bell hole tissue , with which three of the five subjects stated they could 289 imagine playing a concert . The mask was estimated to impair the free movement and sufficient 290 inhalation for playing . Perceived sound attenuation , including difficulties in intonation , was present 291 more or less for all devices that covered the bell hole . However , attenuation was not visible in the 292 LTAS of any of the installations . Additionally , a tight covering of the bell hole prohibited the playing 293 of low pitches where all finger holes are closed . 294 Thus , none of the evaluated potential safety measures fulfilled all the needs of the recorder players 295 and the function as protection mechanism . 296 Limitations 297 The presented study concentrated on the impulse dispersion of a single musical phrase . However , in 298 real life situations , the rehearsal of a whole piece takes much longer and , consequently , aerosol 299 clouds could accumulate in the room . Additionally , the study measured motionless , single players . It 300 can be expected that children playing in larger groups will produce flows in the room which would 301 be difficult to predict , which underlines the importance to aerate the room frequently or with 302 opposed windows open . 303 Furthermore , the measured values represent the distance reached by the aerosol cloud but not the 304 number of aerosols or their concentration in the cloud . Additionally , the potential virus dose in such 305 a cloud differs by subject and in the course of disease . 306 Another limitation of this study is the rather small sample size of 5 subjects . 307 Conclusion 308 This study investigated the impulse dispersion of aerosols in soprano recorders and evaluated three 309 different potential safety devices concerning the spread of aerosols , i . e . , different types of covering 310 of the holes and a suction funnel . The pure aerosol cloud dispersion were found to be comparable to 311 those of the clarinet measured in a previous study . Concerning the evaluated potential safety 312 installations , the different types of covering the instrument did not show clear benefits in prohibiting 313 the expansion of the aerosol clouds and were furthermore rated as impracticable by the subjects . 314 The suction funnel showed almost total reduction of the aerosol clouds and , thus , seems to be a 315 effective method to remove the aerosol particles immediately after the emission from the 316 instrument . 317 318 .
