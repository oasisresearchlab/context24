Introduction Traditional diversity measures , such as the Shannon index or the Simpson index , summarize the information about the relative abundances of species without incorpor - ating ecological differences between species . However , a community composed of ecologically dissimilar taxa is intuitively more diverse than a community composed of more similar taxa . Therefore , useful indices of diversity should account for inter - species differences related to functional type , morphology , taxonomic relatedness , or genetic distances , as ecological differences between species are believed to be reﬂected in each of these ( Izsa´k and Papp , 1995 , 2000 ; Warwick and Clarke , 1995 ; Clarke and Warwick , 1998 ; Shimatani , 2001 ; Ricotta , 2004 ) . Imagine a species assemblage or community composed of S species , where p j is the relative abundance ( measured as number of individuals , biomass or any other biological parameter that is thought to inﬂuence ecosystem function - ing ) of the j th species ( j ¼ 1 , 2 , . . . , S ) such that 0 p p j p 1 and P Sj ¼ 1 p j ¼ 1 . In his seminal paper , Rao ( 1982 ) ﬁrst proposed a diversity index that incorporates both species relative abundances and a measure of the pairwise distances between species . Quadratic diversity , or quadratic entropy ( Q ) is deﬁned as the expected distance between two randomly selected individuals : Q ¼ X S i ¼ 1 X S j ¼ 1 d ij p i p j ¼ p 0 D p , ( 1 ) where d ij is the distance between species i and j , p 0 denotes the transpose of the vector p ¼ ( p 1 , p 2 , y , p S ) , and D is the quadratic distance matrix with elements d ij . To apply Q in practice , the pairwise species distances d ij need to be speciﬁed . There are already several methods offered for numerically expressing pairwise interspecies distances . For example , these distances can be based on morphological or functional differences ( Izsa´k and Papp , 1995 ) , on phylogenetic relationships among species ( Webb , ARTICLE IN PRESS www . elsevier . com / locate / tpb 0040 - 5809 / $ - see front matter r 2006 Elsevier Inc .

Szeidl ) . 2000 ) , on the number of nodes of a Linnaean taxonomic tree separating two species ( Izsa´k and Papp , 1995 , 2000 ; Warwick and Clarke , 1995 , 1998 ; Ricotta , 2004 ) , or on more reﬁned molecular biological methods ( Solow et al . , 1993 ; Shimatani , 2001 ) . Using pairwise species distances obtained from the topology of Linnaean classiﬁcations , Warwick and Clarke ( 1995 ) demonstrated a continuous decrease in the taxo - nomic diversity of a marine assemblage along a gradient of increasing environmental contamination in a situation where species diversity remains constant . Shimatani ( 2001 ) examining the effects of different forest management techniques in southwest Michigan ( USA ) further showed that , if the pairwise species distances are obtained from taxonomic trees as proposed by Warwick and Clarke ( 1995 ) , the thinning operations for promoting survival of speciﬁc species increased the taxonomic diversity of the vegetation . Regardless of how pairwise species distances are constructed , some restrictions should be imposed on the d ij elements of D to gain advantageous properties of Q . For instance , d ij should be a metric on the set of S species , thus conforming to the following requirements : ( a ) symmetry ( d ij ¼ d ji ) , ( b ) non - negativity ( d ij X 0 ) , ( c ) zero self - difference ( d ii ¼ 0 ) , and ( d ) triangle inequality ( d ij p d ik + d kj ) . Proper - ties ( a ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) imply ( b ) . Also , the distances d ij should be standardized such that 0 p d ij p 1 . The reason for imposing these restrictions will be clear in the following sections when dealing with measures of conﬂict . Notice that in relevant cases , for example in the case of resource - type differences ( see Izsa´k and Papp , 1995 ) , the pairwise species differences d ij do not necessarily fulﬁll the distance axioms . It is easily shown that , for any multivariate distance d that is metric , if d ij ¼ 1 , Q reduces to the Simpson ( 1949 ) index D ¼ 1 (cid:1) P Sj ¼ 1 p 2 j . For a parallelism between D and Q within the framework of interspeciﬁc encounter theory , see Izsa´k and Szeidl ( 2002 ) . In this paper , we show that Q can be interpreted as the average conﬂict among the species of a given assemblage . Based on this unusual way of looking at Q , we further deﬁne a parametric version of quadratic diversity Q a as an extension of the Tsallis ( 1998 ) generalized entropy . 2 . A parametric extension of the Shannon entropy According to Shannon ( 1948 ) , the amount of statistical information associated to a given relative abundance vector p ( i . e . , its Shannon entropy ) is measured by the quantity : H ¼ (cid:1) X S j ¼ 1 p j ln p j . ( 2 ) The above equation is Shannon’s fundamental expression for the description of the average information content per symbol in signals that carry a message from source to destination . Entropy is never negative ; in Shannon’s deﬁnition , base 2 logarithm is used to measure information content in bits , while in ecological applications the natural logarithm is traditionally used . The Shannon entropy H of a given community is basically a measure of uncertainty in predicting the relative abundance of the species that compose the relative abundance vector p ¼ ( p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p S ) . The amount of information obtained from observing the result of an experiment depending on chance can be taken to be numerically equal to the amount of uncertainty in the outcome of the experiment before carrying it out . Therefore , Shannon’s entropy can also be viewed as a measure of information ( Acze´l and Daro´czy , 1975 ) . It is easily shown that the maximum value of Shannon’s entropy H max ¼ ln S is obtained in case of equiprobability ( i . e . , if p j ¼ 1 / S for all j ) . By contrast , minimum entropy is obtained if the relative abundance of a given species approaches 1 ( the abundances of all other species approaching null ) , which implies H min ¼ 0 . In statistical parlance , the quantity ( (cid:1) ln p j ) in ( 2 ) is sometimes referred to as the surprise s ( p j ) associated to species j . If p j is small , we would be quite surprised in ﬁnding species j . Accordingly , ( (cid:1) ln p j ) is large for small relative abundances p j . To the contrary , if p j is large , the corresponding surprise is small . Thus , ( 2 ) may be viewed as the mathematical expectation value of the surprise H ¼ P Sj ¼ 1 p j s ð p j Þ . This way of looking at Shannon’s entropy reinforces the observation that H is a measure of the uncertainty associated with the species relative abun - dance vector p . Since uncertainty is maximal when entropy is highest , information - theoretical measures seem an adequate choice for providing a statistical base for diversity analysis ( He and Orlo´ci , 1993 ) . It is therefore not surprising that Shannon’s entropy appeared in early works on community structure ( McArthur , 1955 ; Pielou , 1966 ) and has rapidly become the most widely used index for summarizing the uncertainty associated to a species relative abundance vector . Almost two decades later , Patil and Taillie ( 1982 ) , equating surprise s ( p j ) with rarity r ( p j ) , generalized the above observations and deﬁned a diversity index d as the average rarity of a given species assemblage : d ¼ P Sj ¼ 1 p j r ð p j Þ . In this view , the Simpson diversity can be rewritten as D ¼ P Sj ¼ 1 p j ð 1 (cid:1) p j Þ , where the quantity ( 1 (cid:1) p j ) is the rarity function of D . Patil and Taillie ( 1982 ) further deﬁned a parametric diversity measure d b , known as the diversity index of degree b as d b ¼ ð 1 (cid:1) P Sj ¼ 1 p b þ 1 j Þ = b . Although d b was proposed in the ecological literature without any information - theoretical interpretation ( see Patil and Taillie , 1982 ) , nevertheless putting a ¼ b + 1 , the diversity index of degree b is identical to Tsallis ( 1998 , 2002 ) non - extensive entropy : H a ¼ 1 (cid:1) X S j ¼ 1 p a j ! , a (cid:1) 1 , ARTICLE IN PRESS C . Ricotta , L . Szeidl / Theoretical Population Biology 70 ( 2006 ) 237 – 243 238 where r ð p j Þ ¼ ð 1 (cid:1) p a (cid:1) 1 j Þ . a (cid:1) 1 if a a 1 ; (cid:1) ln p j if a ¼ 1 : 8 < : ( 3 ) H a is a rediscovery of the generalized entropy of type a ( Acze´l and Daro´czy , 1975 ; To´thme´re´sz , 1995 ) , though with a different prefactor ( ﬁtted for base e variables instead of binary variables ) . For a thorough examination of the mathematical properties of H a , see Acze´l and Daro´czy ( 1975 ) , Tsallis ( 1998 , 2002 ) . From a biological viewpoint , one particularly convenient property of H a is that both the Shannon and the Simpson diversities are special cases of this function . For a ¼ 2 , H 2 ¼ D , while for a ¼ 1 , H a is deﬁned in the limiting sense using l’Hospital’s rule of calculus , and H 1 equals Shannon’s entropy . Finally , for a ¼ 0 , H 0 ¼ S (cid:1) 1 ( i . e . , a linear function of species richness that sets the diversity of monospeciﬁc communities equal to zero ) . A well - known property of these measures is that they have different sensitivities to the presence of rare and abundant species in the community ( Hill , 1973 ; Ricotta , 2000 ) . For instance , the Simpson index is less affected by the relative abundances of rare species than the species richness or the Shannon’s entropy in the computation of diversity ( i . e . , if p i b p j , p i 2 b p j 2 ) . Therefore , while traditional diversity indices supply point descriptions of community structure , according to Patil and Taille ( 1982 ) deﬁnition of parametric diversity , there is a continuum of possible diversity measures that differ in their sensitivity to the rare and abundant species , becoming increasingly dominated by the commonest species for increasing values of parameter a . For a given community , H a is a decreasing function of a , and the various diversity measures obtained by changing a are in fact different moments of the same basic function . In this view , changing a can be considered as a scaling operation that takes place not in the real , but in the data space ( Podani , 1992 ) . This scaling operation allows for vector description of community structure that can be represented by its diversity proﬁle of H a vs . a ( Patil and Taillie , 1982 ) . All this is very classic . 3 . Extending the meaning of quadratic diversity To make clear the type of uncertainty measured by the Shannon entropy , it is convenient to rewrite H in the form : H ¼ (cid:1) X S j ¼ 1 p j ln 1 (cid:1) X S i a j p i ! , ( 4 ) where the term C ð p j Þ ¼ P Si a j p i measures the relative abundance of all species that differ from species j . That is , the probabilities of all events that conﬂict with p j . While C ( p j ) A [ 0 , 1 ] , the rarity function (cid:1) ln [ 1 (cid:1) C ( p j ) ] is monotonic increasing with C ( p j ) and extends its range from [ 0 , 1 ] to [ 0 , N ] . It follows that the Shannon entropy basically measures the expected value of the conﬂict among the different elements in p . If we stay with a rigorous probabilistic approach to the measurement of uncertainty , Eq . ( 4 ) implicitly states that the elements in p fully conﬂict with each other . On the other hand , imagine a species assemblage in which all pairwise species distances are measured using a standar - dized coefﬁcient 0 p d ij p 1 . In this case , it seems natural to summarize the conﬂict between species j and the remaining species as C d ð p j Þ ¼ P Si a j d ij p i , such that the Shannon - like expression of average conﬂict becomes H d ¼ (cid:1) X S j ¼ 1 p j ln 1 (cid:1) X S i a j d ij p i ! . ( 5 ) Therefore , the above equation enables to quantify a more general form of the conﬂict among the species of a given community taking into account the pairwise species distances d ij . Notice that a more restrictive formulation of Eq . ( 5 ) with an asymmetric measure of dissimilarity d ij is extensively used within the context of the Dempster – Shafer theory of evidence for deriving information - theoretical measures of uncertainty if the conﬂict between evidential claims is not maximal ( see Klir and Wierman , 1999 ) . This approach can be easily generalized to virtually any diversity measure d that is expressed as d ¼ P Sj ¼ 1 p j r ð p j Þ , as suggested by Patil and Taillie ( 1982 ) . Take for example the case of the Simpson index D ¼ P Sj ¼ 1 p j ½ 1 (cid:1) ð 1 (cid:1) P Si a j p i Þ(cid:2) . Incorporating a measure of pairwise species distances d ij in D , we obtain D d ¼ X S j ¼ 1 p j X S i a j d ij p i (cid:1) (cid:2) , ( 6 ) where D d is identical to Rao’s quadratic diversity Q . Hence , Rao’s Q can be interpreted as a measure of average conﬂict among species . This is a very interesting outcome of Patil and Taille ( 1982 ) proposal of expressing diversity as the average rarity of a given species assemblage . Likewise , adding pairwise species distances to Patil and Taillie parametric diversity measure H a , we obtain Q a ¼ 1 (cid:1) P Sj ¼ 1 p j 1 (cid:1) P Si a j d ij p i (cid:3) (cid:4) a (cid:1) 1 a (cid:1) 1 . ( 7 ) The above equation represents a parametric counterpart of Rao’s quadratic diversity that bridges the gap with traditional diversity measures , such as the Shannon entropy or the Simpson diversity . In this sense , expressing diversity as the mean conﬂict among the elements in p , it is possible to frame Rao’s quadratic diversity within a larger family of measures that summarize diversity including both species relative abundances and pairwise species dissim - ilarities in the computation .

Final remarks Regarding index properties , since Q a is not a traditional diversity measure computed uniquely from species relative abundances , it violates the usual diversity axiom that the maximum value Q max a is obtained at the uniform distribu - tion ( Shimatani , 2001 ) . Rather , very often only few points are given non - zero abundances at Q max a . Another diversity axiom that is violated by Q a is the permutation invariance ( Pielou , 1975 ) . This postulates that the diversity values corresponding to the relative abundances p 1 , p 2 , y , p S and to a p 1 0 , p 2 0 , y , p S 0 permutation of those are identical . These properties imply that the diversity measures do not depend on the relations between species and so all species play the same role in the formation of the diversity measures . In a previous paper ( Ricotta , 2002 ) , the diversity indices such as Q a that have their greatest value for non - completely even communities were deﬁned ‘weak diversity indices’ . Finally , as suggested by Rao ( 1986 ) ; see also Lau ( 1985 ) , a desirable property for a diversity measure is concavity , which means that the total diversity in a pooled set of communities should not be lower to the average diversity within communities . Given two relative abundance vectors p and q and two weights 0 p m 1 p 1 , 0 p m 2 p 1 , m 1 + m 2 ¼ 1 , d ð m 1 p þ m 2 q Þ X m 1 d ð p Þ þ m 2 d ð q Þ , ( 8 ) where weights m 1 and m 2 associated to p and q may be equal ( i . e . , m 1 ¼ m 2 ¼ 1 / 2 ) , or may reﬂect properties as diverse as community size , their conservation value , etc . In concrete terms , the concavity of d means that diversity increases by mixing ( Pavoine et al . , 2004 , 2005 ) . Patil and Taillie ( 1982 ) demonstrated the concavity of parametric diversity H a in the interval 0 p a p N , while Champely and Chessel ( 2002 ) demonstrated that , if the species distance matrix D is Euclidean , then Rao’s quadratic diversity Q is concave . More speciﬁcally , a matrix D ( S (cid:3) S ) of distances is said to be Euclidean if and only if S points can be embedded in a Euclidean space such that the Euclidean distance between S i and S j is d ij ( Gower and Legendre , 1986 ) . In the following appendix , we demonstrate that Rao’s quadratic diversity Q ( Q ¼ D d ¼ Q 2 ) is concave if and only if the matrix H ¼ ð h ij Þ S (cid:1) 1 i ; j ¼ 1 ; h ij ¼ d iS þ d jS (cid:1) d ij ; 1 p i ; j p S (cid:1) 1 is positive semideﬁnite . This property holds for every distance matrix for S ¼ 2 , 3 , 4 . For S X 5 it remains an open question . In the special case of an Euclidean distance matrix D , then the matrix H is positive semideﬁnite ; this follows from the results of Champely and Chessel ( 2002 ) . More generally , for 0 o a o 2 the concavity supposedly is not fulﬁlled and this can be demonstrated by given calculations . Finally , we demonstrate that the diversity index Q a ; a X 2 is concave for a special class of distance matrices D : if the matrix C ¼ ð c ij Þ ; c ij ¼ 1 (cid:1) d ij is positive semideﬁnite , then Q a is concave . Although these results may be disappointing , we do not think they should be a cause for pessimism . For instance , in a recent review on diversity indices , Ricotta ( 2005 ) showed that there exists a clear disagreement among ecologists as far as biodiversity conceptualization and evaluation is concerned . This fundamental ambiguity has ensured that the measurement of diversity remains ‘‘capricious’’ ( Sarkar and Margules , 2002 ) and that even a property as general as concavity is not unanimously accepted among ecologists . For example , one very common diversity index that is not concave is the Simpson diversity in the form : D ¼ 1 = P Sj ¼ 1 p 2 j . More generally , we think that the major result of this paper does not consist in the proposal of an additional measure of parametric diversity , but rather in the inter - pretation of quadratic diversity as a measure of average ( distance - dependent ) conﬂict among species . Based on this unusual deﬁnition , parametric diversity Q a emerges as a natural way for bridging the gap between quadratic diversity and traditional information - theoretical measures such as the Shannon entropy . We hope , this connection will prove fruitful in future ecological research .

It is easy to verify that p ¼ ð p 1 ; . . . ; p S Þ 0 ; q ¼ ð q 1 ; . . . ; q S Þ 0 2 P S and 0 p X S i ¼ 1 X S j ¼ 1 ð p i (cid:1) q i Þ c ij ð p j (cid:1) q j Þ ¼ X S (cid:1) 1 i ¼ 1 X S (cid:1) 1 j ¼ 1 ð p i (cid:1) q i Þ h ij ð p j (cid:1) q j Þ ¼ 1 x 20 X S (cid:1) 1 i ¼ 1 X S (cid:1) 1 j ¼ 1 ð x þ i (cid:1) x (cid:1) i Þ h ij ð x þ i (cid:1) x (cid:1) i Þ ¼ 1 x 2 0 X S (cid:1) 1 i ¼ 1 X S (cid:1) 1 j ¼ 1 x i h ij x j ¼ 1 x 2 0 x 0 Hx . Conversely , if inequality ( A . 7 ) holds , we choose x i ¼ p i (cid:1) q i ; 1 p i p S (cid:1) 1 and then by the use of identity ( A . 6 ) , from relation ( A . 7 ) immediately follows ( A . 5 ) . Remark 1 . It can be veriﬁed that for S ¼ 2 , 3 , 4 the matrix H is positive semideﬁnite , therefore function Q a ð p Þ is concave on set P S . For S X 5 the problem has not been solved . Remark 2 . Using the triangle inequality property of distances d ij , we can observe that the elements of matrix H satisfy the following inequalities : h ij X 0 ; h ij p h ii ; h ij p h jj ; 1 p i ; j p S (cid:1) 1 , ( A . 8 ) i . e . H is a similarity matrix . Unfortunately , the positive semideﬁnite property is not guaranteed by inequalities ( A . 8 ) , as the following example shows ( Gala´ntai , pers . commun . ) . Let us deﬁne matrix H 0 as follows : H 0 ¼ 1 : 4501 0 : 4966 0 : 6111 0 : 4458 0 : 4746 0 : 4966 0 : 9565 0 : 4052 0 : 8784 0 : 3988 0 : 6111 0 : 4052 1 : 4218 0 : 8276 0 : 4947 0 : 4458 0 : 8784 0 : 8276 0 : 9103 0 : 4518 0 : 4746 0 : 3988 0 : 4947 0 : 4518 0 : 6389 0 BBBBBB @ 1 CCCCCCA . The eigenvalues of matrix H 0 are eig ( H 0 ) ¼ ( – 0 . 0469 , 0 . 3297 , 0 . 8019 , 0 . 9521 , 3 . 3408 ) , therefore the matrix is not positive deﬁnite . III Case a X 2 . Theorem 2 . If matrix C is positive semideﬁnite ( i . e . x 0 C x X 0 for all x 2 R S ; ) , then the diversity index Q a ð p Þ is concave . Proof . At ﬁrst we note that in case a ¼ 2 the statement of Theorem 2 is an immediate consequence of inequality ( A . 4 ) and the positive semideﬁnite property of matrix C . & From formula ( A . 2 ) it can be seen that I 2 ; a ð l Þ is non - negative because all members in the expression I 2 ; a ð l Þ are non - negative . Thus , for inequality f 00 a ð p Þ p 0 it is enough to prove inequality I 1 ; a ð l Þ X 0 . It is clear that I 1 ; a ð l Þ ¼ 2 ð a (cid:1) 1 Þ X S j ¼ 1 ð p j (cid:1) q j Þð a j (cid:1) b j Þ r j ¼ 2 ð a (cid:1) 1 Þ X S j ¼ 1 X S i ¼ 1 ð p j (cid:1) q j Þ r j c ij ð p i (cid:1) q i Þ ¼ 2 ð a (cid:1) 1 Þð p (cid:1) q Þ 0 RC ð p (cid:1) q Þ , where r j ¼ ð l ð a j (cid:1) b j Þ þ b j Þ a (cid:1) 2 ; 1 p j p S and R ¼ diag ð r 1 ; . . . ; r S Þ . The matrices C and R are positive semideﬁnite , therefore the product matrix RC is also positive semideﬁnite . From this it follows that I 1 ; a ð l Þ X 0 .
