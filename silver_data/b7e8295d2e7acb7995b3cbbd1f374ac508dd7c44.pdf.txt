Selective Translocation of the A Chain of Diphtheria Toxin across the Membrane of Purified Endosomes * ( Received for publication , July 22 , 1991 ) Bruno BeaumelleS , Lelia Bensammar , and Alain Bienvenue From the URA 530 Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique , Dipartement Biologie Sante , Case 107 , Uniuersite Montpellier II , 34095 Montpellier Cedex 5 , France Translocation is a necessary and rate - limiting step for diphtheria toxin ( DT ) cytotoxicity . We have recon - stituted DT translocation in a cell - free system using endosomes purified from lymphocytes and have dem - onstrated this using two different probe / cell systems , which provided identical results : ' 261 - DT / human CEM cells and ' 261 - transferrin - DT / mouse BW cells . The cell - free DT translocation process was found to be depend - ent on the presence of the pH gradient endosome ( pH 6 . 3 ) / cytosol ( pH 7 ) . Among the pH equilibrating agents , nigericin ( 6 p ~ ) was found to be the most effective , inhibiting DT translocation by 88 % . An optimum pH value of 7 on the cytosolic side of the membrane ( pH gradient ~ 1 . 7 ) was determined . ATP per se is not required for DT translocation . I2 ' I - DT translocation was % fold more active from late than from early en - dosomes , probably because of their slightly more acidic pH . Only the A chain of the toxin was found to escape from either 12 ' I - DT / CEM or 12 ' I - transferrin - DT / BW endosomes . Translocation of control endosome labels ( 12 ' I - transferrin and ' 261 - horseradish peroxidase ) was never observed . We also show that DT receptors pres - ent on resistant ( mouse ) cells block the translocation of the toxin and are responsible for the resistance of these cells to DT . Toxins such as ricin and diphtheria toxin ( DT ) ' first need to reach the cytosol in order to exert their cytotoxic effect ( 1 ) . Even though the identity of the cellular compartment from which ricin ( at least the A chain ) escapes to the cytosol has not yet been clearly identified ( 1 , 2 ) , all recent studies of DT entry into the cell agree that the translocation step is localized in the endosome . This process enables this toxin to gain access to its target , diphthamide , an amino acid only found in elongation factor 2 ( 3 ) .

Another action of DT through deoxyribonuclease activity has also been reported , but the contribution of this enzymatic activity in cytotoxicity is still being discussed ( 4 ) . Endocytosis is a first and necessary step for DT toxicity ( 3 ) . After DT binding to a specific receptor ( 5 ) , the toxin is internalized uniquely via coated pits ( 2 ) and reaches the endosome where the acidic pH will induce conformational changes ( 6 ) . The A chain is then transferred to the cytosol . DT translocation has been studied using whole cells exposed to low pH after DT binding at 4 " C , simulating the endosome environment ( 3 , 7 ) . Incubation at 37 " C induced protection from pronase digestion of the A chain , which could be released from the cells upon permeabilization ( 3 , 8 ) . The presence of a pH gradient and of functional anion transport was required for translocation ( 3 ) . Since translocation is the rate - limiting step for toxin cyto - toxicity ( 9 ) , and because we found that the ricin translocation rate ( which is pH independent ) is much lower from plasma membrane vesicles than from endosomes ? we thought that DT translocation remained to be demonstrated and analyzed at the level of the membrane through which translocation naturally occurs : the endosome membrane . We show in this paper that DT translocation can be ob - served in a cell - free system using functional endosomes puri - fied from lymphocytes . A selective translocation of the A chain of DT was demonstrated and found to be dependent upon the pH gradient across the endosome membrane , the temperature , and the time of endocytosis . ATP per se was not required for the process . lZ5I - DT translocation was only ob - served across the endosome membrane of DT - sensitive cells ( CEM human lymphocytes ) . DT binding sites found on re - sistant cells ( BW mouse lymphocytes ) inactivate its translo - cation ability and protect these cells against intoxication . This resistance could be overcome by the use of an alternative binding system . MATERIALS AND METHODS Chemicals and Probes - Chemicals were obtained from Sigma ( L ' Isle d ' Abeau , France ) and radioactive products from Amersham ( Les Ulis , France ) . Three different sources of DT were found to give similar results throughout this study . The first batch was obtained from Lisp Laboratories ( Campbell , CA ) , the second was a kind gift of Dr . P . Boquet ( Institut Pasteur , Paris ) , and a third was prepared using established procedures ( 10 ) from a suitable supernatant of cultures of Corynebacterium diphtheriae purchased from the Institut Mkrieux ( Marcy l ' Etoile , France ) . Briefly , after ammonium sulfate precipitation and dialysis , DT was purified by ion - exchange chro - matography on DEAE - cellulose followed by gel filtration ( 10 ) .

Hopkins , unpublished data . 11525 11526 Diphtheria Toxin Translocation across the Endosome Membrane tions . It only gave one peak when analysed on a Mono Q column using a linear NaCl gradient and was thus free of contaminating nuclease ( 11 ) . This preparation was used for transferrin - DT ( Tf - DT ) conjugation . Labeling of DT , horseradish peroxidase , transferrin , and Tf - DT with ' " 1 was performed using the Iodogen method ( 12 ) to a specific activity of 25 pCi / pg for DT and 8 pCi / pg for the other proteins . Fluorescein labeling and fluorescence measurements were carried out as described ( 13 ) . Transferrin was conjugated with horse - radish peroxidase using the SPDP method ricin and DT were labeled with 10 - nm diameter gold at pH 7 ( 13 ) . Conjugation of Transferrin with DT - Transferrin ( 15 mg in 1 ml of PBS ) was treated with a 2 M excess of SPDP ( 40 mM in ethanol ) for 30 min at room temperature . DT ( 6 mg in 0 . 7 ml of PBS ) was derivatized in the same conditions with a 2 . 5 M excess of SPDP . Unreacted SPDP was removed by gel filtration on Sephadex G - 25 ( PD 10 columns , Pharmacia ) eluted with PBS . DT was then concen - trated back to its original volume by centrifugation ( centricon 10 , Amicon ) and treated with 50 mM dithiothreitol . The reducing agent was eliminated by passing through a Sephadex G - 25 column ( 1 X 20 cm ) equilibrated with PBS , and the proteins were mixed in a 1 : l molar ratio . After one night at room temperature a 100 - fold molar excess ( compared with DT ) of iodoacetamide was added , and the conjugates were purified on a Sephacryl S - 200 column ( 1 X 65 cm ) eluted with 2 ml of PBS / h . They were identified by SDS - PAGE , and stored sterile at 4 " C . A previously described method for coupling transferrin and DT via SPDP ( 14 ) mostly gave high molecular weight conjugates , whereas 1 : l hybrid was the major product of the conjugation when performed as described above ( see " Results " ) . Cell Labeling and Fractionation - The human CCRF - CEM and the mouse BW 5147 leukemic T cell lines were maintained in culture as described previously ( 13 , 15 ) . They were labeled at a concentration of 2 X 10 ' cells / ml of DMEM supplemented with 0 . 1 mg BSA / ml ( DMEM / BSA ) and 150 pg of low density lipoproteins ( LDL ) / ml for 40 min at 37 " C ( 13 ) . The following label concentrations were used " ' I - DT and ' 251 - horseradish peroxidase , 4 pCi / ml ; ' " 1 - transferrin and ' " I - Tf - DT , 1 pCi / ml ; fluorescein - transferrin ( Fl - Tf ) or F1 - DT , 0 . 1 mg / ml . After cooling to 2 " C , washing twice with DMEM / BSA and ricin - gold treatment at 2 " C , cells were submitted to the endosome isolation procedure ( 13 ) . Briefly , cells were lysed ( using , after the nitrogen cavitation treatment , 20 and 10 strokes of potter for BW and CEM cells , respectively ) , the post - nuclear supernatant was treated with 1 pg trypsin / ml for 3 min at 37 " C , and crude membranes were separated on a discontinuous sucrose gradient made of 0 . 5 ml of 2 . 5 M sucrose and then 3 . 5 ml of 40 , 30 , and 20 % sucrose prepared in gradient buffer : 1 mM EDTA , 10 mM acetic acid , 10 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 5 ) . Endosomes were collected from the 30 % / 20 % interface . Ricin - gold binding increases the plasma membrane density , enabling pel - letting during the gradient ( 13 ) . Translocation Assay - Endosomes were resuspended in transloca - tion buffer ( 110 mM KC1 , 15 mM MgC12 , 1 rg of penicillin G / ml , 20 mM Pipes ( pH 7 . 1 ) ) & 10 mM ATP and 10 mM Mg & After incubation at 37 " C for 2 h , except when otherwise indicated , translocation was terminated by cooling on ice and spinning through a 17 % sucrose cushion ( in gradient buffer ) for 5 min at 160 , 000 X g ( Beckman Airfuge centrifuge ) . Results are expressed as the increase in the ratio cpm supernatant X 100 observed compared with the control value cpm membranes ( obtained from tubes kept on ice ) . When ' " I - transferrin - or ' " 1 - horseradish peroxidase - loaded endosomes were examined , no signifi - cant variation of this ratio was observed , up to 3 h at 37 " C in the absence or in the presence of ATP ( see " Results " ) . Other Methods - ATP concentrations were assayed using a lucif - erase kit from Boehringer . Electron microscopy was performed essen - tially as described ( 13 ) except that Epon sections have been observed without uranyl and lead contrast . Binding experiments were conducted using 0 . 3 % Pronase in PBS for 1 h at 2 " C to scrape off plasma membrane - bound label ( 13 ) . This procedure proved to be efficient for " ' I - transferrin , ' " I - DT , or " ' 1 - Assays for toxin cytotoxicity were performed as described for these cells ( 16 ) , except that [ 36S ] methionine was used as labeled amino acid . ADP - ribosylation activities were tested using purified elongation factor 2 ( a gift of Prof . J . P . Reboud , Lyon , France ) and [ 32P ] NAD as reported ( a ) , except that 20 ' C incubations were used . Tf - DT . At least two independent experiments were performed ( n = 4 or n = 6 ) . RESULTS DT Endocytosis by Human and Mouse Lymphocytes - Most studies of DT endocytosis and translocation have been per - formed using Vero cells because they display = 100 , 000 recep - tors compared with ~ 4 , 000 on most other cell types like lymphocytes ( 1 ) . Nevertheless , in preliminary internalization studies using DT labeled at = 25 pCi / pg , a significant and time - dependent accumulation of " ' I - DT inside both human ( CEM ) and mouse ( BW ) lymphocytes was observed ( Fig . 1 ) . Using continuous labeling , up to 20 or 10 % of the label is found inside the cell after 45 min for CEM and BW cells , respectively . When endosomes were isolated from BW cells after F1 - DT labeling ( for 40 min at 37 " C ) , a mean pH of 5 . 20 f 0 . 04 ( n = 4 ) was observed for the probe , confirming that these cells can endocytose DT into acidic compartments . Significant DT endocytosis by mouse ( DT - resistant ) cells has been reported previously ( 17 ) . Fractionation of Human CEM Lymphocytes - We decided to use CEM lymphocyte endosomes to try to reconstitute DT translocation in a cell - free system . In all fractionation exper - iments CEM cells were shown to behave like BW cells and , except for a more gentle lysis procedure ( see " Materials and Methods " ) , no adaptation of the endosome isolation method ( 13 ) was found necessary . Endosomes from CEM cells were susceptible to LDL treatment used for BW endosome isola - tion ( 13 ) , even if their receptor number for LDL is signifi - cantly lower ( 5 - 7 - fold ) than the one observed on BW cells ( 13 , 18 ) . The CEM endosome preparations obtained ( Table I ) show a yield and purity similar to those prepared from BW cells ( 13 ) . DT Is Cointernalized with Transferrin by CEM Lympho - cytes - The two ligands transferrin and DT enter the cell by the same coated pit pathway ( 19 ) . Electron microscopic ex - amination of the endosome preparation from CEM cells after labeling at 37 " C with gold - DT and Tf - horseradish peroxidase shows that endocytosis of the latter is more efficient and some peroxidase - positive endosomes do not contain any gold ( Fig . 2 ) . DT is mainly found in peroxidase - positive compartments ( Fig . 2 ) , demonstrating that these cells cointernalize DT and transferrin . " ' I - Transferrin was thus routinely used as a control for lZ5I - DT translocation experiments . Despite the very low efficiency of fluid phase uptake in lymphocytes , " ' I - horseradish peroxidase was also used in this study as a control for endosome lysis . 0 15 30 45 60 Time ( mn ) FIG . 1 .

After isolation , endosomes were proc - essed for electron microscopy , using diaminobenzidine as substrate to localize Tf - horseradish peroxidase ( 13 ) . DT - gold was mainly found in horseradish peroxidase - positive structures ( a , double arrow , and b ) . Tf - horseradish peroxidase was also observed in compartments devoid of DT - gold ( a , single arrow ) . Bar = 0 . 1 pm . DT Translocation Can Be Observed in a Cell - free System Using Endosomes Purified from GEM Lymphocytes ( It Is ATP - independent ) - When ' 251 - DT - labeled CEM endosomes were incubated at 37 " C in the presence of 10 mM ATP a linear time - dependent release of ' 251 - toxin was observed in the medium ( Fig . 3a ) . Cointernalization of DT with 1251 - transferrin did not induce any release of label from endosomes during the translocation assay ( data not shown ) . As shown in Fig . 3b , DT was able to translocate even without ATP addi - tion . Inclusion of an ATP - depleting system ( 5 mM glucose , hexokinase 120 units / ml ) in the assay to hydrolyse the resid - ual endosomal ATP concentration ( always < lo0 nM ) to an undetectable value ( < 0 . 1 nM ) had no effect on ' " 1 - DT trans - location rate ( 89 * 9 % of the rate with 10 mM ATP , n = 6 ) . Thus , DT translocation is ATP - independent . ' 251 - DT Translocation Is Dependent upon the pH Gradient Endosome + Cytosol - The endosomal pH was found to be 5 . 2 ( for both cell types ) using Fl - DT fluorescence measure - ments . According to the effect of the agents increasing this endosomal pH up to the buffer value this ( 5 . 2 + 7 . 1 ) pH gradient is necessary for DT translocation to proceed ( shown in the left column of Table 11 ) . Among these molecules niger - icin ( 5 p ~ ) was the most efficient , enabling the reduction of DT translocation rate by up to 93 % . These agents were the : " i / .

TABLE I1 Effect of agents raising endosome pH on ' 251 - DT translocation rate CEM and BW cells were labeled with , respectively , 1251 - DT and formed ( with ATP ) as described under " Materials and Methods , " in 1251 - Tf - DT .

Addi - tion of the ATP - depleting system to the assay did not result in a significant increase of endosome pH ( as monitored using Fl - DT or Fl - Tf ) after 2 h , and this explains the absence of any effect on the translocation rate . Thus , the pH gradient endosome / cytosol is the driving force for DT translocation , and ATP is only required indirectly by the endosome in order to establish the gradient via the action of the proton ATPase present in its membrane ( 20 ) . In the absence of ATP , proton leakage of the endosomes was too slow to significantly impair DT translocation over the time of the experiment so that no ATP dependence of the process was observed . 12 ' I - DT Translocation Rate Is Increasing with Its Progres - sion in the Endosomal System - Both labeling ( Fig . 4a ) and chase experiments ( Fig . 46 ) showed that ' 251 - DT escapes more rapidly from late than from early CEM endosomes . This difference in the behavior of ' 251 - DT between these compart - ments seems to arise at least partly from acidification , as monitored using Fl - DT ( and similar labeling procedures as with 12 ' I - DT ) , which is observed along the pathway ( Fig . 4c ) . This acidification observed when probes move from early to late endosomes has been documented earlier ( 21 ) . Neverthe - less , although the translocation rate increases % fold between 10 and 40 min of labeling ( Fig . 4a ) , the corresponding acidi - fication is only 0 . 2 pH unit ( Fig . 4c ) . This is probably because these endosome - pH values are located in the pH 4 . 9 - 5 . 4 Diphtheria Toxin Translocation across the Endosome Membrane 10 - I I 20 - I 1 5 5 . 2 5 . 1 5 . 0 1 0 20 30 4 0 Time 01 endocytosis ( rnn ) FIG . 4 . Translocation rate of " " I - DT as a function of its depth in the endocytic pathway . a , CEM cells were labeled with ' " " IDT for the indicated period of time before endosome isolation and translocation assay were performed . b , cells were labeled with " " I - DT for 10 min at 37 " C as indicated under " Materials and Meth - ods " ; after washing , a chase was performed in DMEM / RSA at 37 " C in the presence of 100 pg / ml of DT for the indicated period of time ; endosomes were then isolated and translocation assayed as described under " Materials and Methods . " c , cells were labeled with DT - FI for the indicated period of time before endosome isolation and pH meas - urements . interval where DT translocation is the most pH dependent ( on the cis side of the membrane ) , as judged by the results obtained by exposure of whole cells with bound DT to pH within this interval : a small drop of pH induces a big rise in intoxication ( 7 ) . These results on ' * ' I - DT translocation from CEM endo - somes concur with data on DT translocation obtained using the cellular system and which indicated a likely ATP inde - pendence of the process ( 8 ) . Since cytotoxicity studies per - formed on whole cells have also demonstrated a relative ATP independence ( 22 ) and an inhibition by weak bases and proton ionophores ( l ) , the data obtained using our cell - free system were thus likely to be relevant in the cellular context , and we decided to study DT translocation in more detail . It has been suggested that it could occur by different mechanisms when directly bound to its receptor or via another binding site , as in the case for immunotoxins or Tf - DT conjugates ( 23 ) . To examine this problem , we synthesized a Tf - DT conjugate so that we could use it on the BW mouse cells , a cell type already used in many fractionation studies ( 13 , 24 - 26 ) . We also intended to take advantage of this system to localize the stage responsible for DT resistance displayed by mouse cells , which has been explained by defects at different steps of the intoxication process , depending on the authors ( 27 ) . A Monovalent Tf - DT Conjugate Is Efficiently Endocytosed by Mouse B W Cells - Conjugation of transferrin and DT using SPDP and the procedure described under " Materials and Methods " yields mainly ( more than 70 % ) a 1 : l Tf - DT con - jugate ( analysis by SDS - PAGE shown in Fig . 5 ) . The " ' I - Tf - D T conjugate was about as efficiently endocytosed as " ' I - transferrin by BW cells , since the proportion of cell label found inside the cell after 30 min at 37 " C reached 65 % for I2 ' II - Tf - DT ( Fig . 5 ) and 70 % for 12 ' I - transferrin ( 13 ) . Endo - cytosis of the conjugate is mainly driven by the transferrin moiety of the hybrid : addition of a 1 , 000 - fold excess of trans - ferrin together with Y - Tf - DT reduces the proportion of endocytosed label to the one mediated by the DT moiety : 8 % ( Fig . 5 ) , in agreement with the 10 % obtained for unconjugated I2 ' I - DT ( Fig . 1 ) . kDa 5X - lime ( mn ) FIG . 5 .

I2 ' I - DT Is Able to Translocate from I2 ' I - Tf - DT - loaded RW Endosomes - Upon incubation at 37 " C in the cell - free system , ' * ' I - Tf - DT - loaded RW endosomes gradually released label ( Fig . 6 ) . It can also be seen in Fig . 6 that " ' I - DT cannot cross the membrane of BW endosomes , when directly bound to the cell and not via transferrin and its receptor . These data agree with the results of cytotoxicity assays on RW cells ; Tf - D ' r is more than a 1 , 000 - fold more cytotoxic than DT to these cells ( ICSo = 7 . 2 lo - " M instead of 7 . 3 10 " ' M ) . The " " I - Tf - DT translocation is linear with time and can he inhibited , as with ' ? ' I - DT - loaded CEM endosomes by weak bases and nigericin ( Table 11 ) . ATP independence was also observed for DT escape from Tf - DT - labeled endosomes ( Fig . 6 ) . Hence , DT translocation seems to proceed via similar mechanisms when directly bound to its receptor or by an alternative binding system . All other experiments were performed using the " " I - Tf - DT / BW murine lymphocyte system . Temperature Dependence of " . ' I - DT Trans , ocation " At 15 - 20 " C a significant fraction ( 35 % ) of the 37 " C rate ( 100 % ) was already observed . Hence we conclude that temperature is not a very critical factor for DT translocation . pH Dependence of " ' I - DT Translocation - Studies using the ' * ' I - Tf - DT / BW system confirmed that ' " I - DT translocation is dependent upon the pH gradient ( Fig . 7 ) . Whatever the pH of the external buffer , the endosome pH was found to he constant ( pH = 5 . 3 , as monitored using FI - Tf ) durinR the experiment . The optimum pH of the buffer ( i . e . of the cyto - solic compartment ) for DT translocation is seven correspond - ing to most cytosolic values ( 28 ) . Low outside pH ( pH = 5 . 5 , no pH gradient ) inhibits translocation , hut high pH ( pH = 8 ) is inhibitory as well .

Dependence of DT translocation upon a pH gradient across the endosome membrane . ' 251 - Tf - DT - labeled BW endo - somes ( mean internal pH 5 . 3 ) were isolated as described under " Materials and Methods , " and translocation was assayed at the indicated pH value using 20 mM buffers ( Mes ( pH 5 . 5 - 6 . 5 ) , Pipes , ( pH 6 . 5 - 7 . 5 ) , Hepes ( pH 7 - 8 ) ) in the presence of ATP . in the presence of 5 PM nigericin to equilibrate the endosome pH at the buffer value , no significant DT translocation was observed whatever the pH ( data not shown ) , confirming the requirement of the pH gradient for the process . Analysis of 12 ' I - DT Pepticles Liberated into the Medium during the Cell - free Translocation Assay - A mixture of 12 ' 1 - Tf - DT ( = 70 % ) , 12 ' I - transferrin ( = 20 % ) , DT , and its subunits ( ~ 1 0 % ) was recovered in the endosomes after cell labeling with " ' I - Tf - DT for 30 min at 37 " C . Analysis by SDS - PAGE of the supernatant obtained from translocation assays using either the I2 ' I - Tf - DT / BW system ( Fig . 8a ) or the " ' I - DT / CEM system ( data not shown ) shows that only a peptide of 21 kDa , presumably the A chain of 12 ' I - DT is actively trans - located from the endosome lumen to the translocation me - dium during the assay in both systems . Some 12 ' I - DT ( 58 kDa ) constitutes the radioactivity background present in all the supernatants . It is not translocated , but probably liber - ated , during the last endosome homogenization step ( the same phenomenon was observed with ' 2 ' I - horseradish peroxidase ) , since the intensity of this spot did not increase with time at 37 " C , as shown ( Fig . 8 ) by the densitometric analysis of gels from 12 ' I - Tf - DT / BW translocation assays . Using purified elongation factor 2 as substrate , a considerable ADP - ribo - sylating activity was found at the level of the 21 - kDa band after translocation ( Fig . 9 ) . This identifies the translocated peptide as the A chain of the toxin . No significant proteolysis of the remaining B subunit was observed after translocation , as shown by SDS - PAGE analy - sis of proteins from the endosome pellet ( Fig . 8b ) . It was not possible to follow the translocation process via the amount of I2 ' I - B - chain remaining in the pellet as it does not only origi - nate from the translocation process ( which transports the A chain through the endosome membrane ) : it is also produced by DT reduction inside the endosome ( in that case the A chain produced stays in the endosome , Fig . 8b ) . Some DT reduction occurs during internalization of the conjugate since both A and B chains are already detected in endosomes at the beginning of the translocation assay ( Fig . 8b ) . DISCUSSION The endosome is the doorstep for the entrance into the cell for several pathogens , such as viruses ( 29 ) or toxins ( 19 ) . The involvement of the endosomal compartment in the cytotox - icity of DT was shown by the action of weak bases , which by neutralizing the acidic endosome pH inhibits the intoxication process ( 1 , 3 ) . These results were later complemented by studies in model systems showing that low pH could induce DT insertion into the liposomal membrane and exposure of 2 1 - Time ( mn ) FIG . 8 .

The gel was cut into 0 . 5 - cm slices , and the proteins from each slice were eluted and analysed for ADP - ribosylating activity as described ( 8 ) , using purified elonga - tion factor 2 and [ " PINAD as substrates . Proteins were then precip - itated with 10 % trichloroacetic acid ( after addition of 300 pg of BSA as a carrier ) and collected onto fiberglass filters ( Whatman GF / C ) .

At the present time , selective translocation of DT ( at con - 11530 Diphtheria Toxin Translocation across the Endosome Membrane centration < 1 WM ) through pure lipid membranes has never been observed ( 30 - 32 ) , and the only system developed for studying DT translocation is based upon the exposure of cells to acidic medium after toxin binding , followed by proteolysis and cell permeabilization to recover the translocated peptides ( 3 ) . The use of this system nevertheless raises several criti - cisms , one of them being that the plasma membrane is clearly different from the endosome membrane through which DT translocation naturally occurs ( 1 , 8 ) , according to both protein and lipid composition studies ( 26 , 33 ) . DT Translocation - The cell - free assay presented in this paper , based on the use of purified endosomes overcomes the major limitations of the cellular system . Endosomes were obtained using a previously detailed technique which yields preparations devoid of significant contamination by other cell compartments ( Table I , Ref . 13 ) . Incubation at 37 " C of lZ5I - Tf - DT - labeled BW endosomes or lz5I - DT - 1abeled CEM en - dosomes in a cell - free system induces the selective release of the lZ6I - A chain , whereas none of the other endosome labels ( ' 251 - horseradish peroxidase or 1251 - transferrin ) used as con - trols showed translocation ability . This translocation of only the A chain of DT confirmed the data obtained by Olsnes et al . ( 8 ) using the cellular model , but in their case another ( 25 - kDa ) fragment more tightly bound to the membrane was also released from the cells upon permeabilization ( 8 ) . The inhibition of DT translocation across the endosome membrane by weak bases and nigericin is the best demonstra - tion that this movement observed in the cell - free system is similar to the one enabling DT to enter the cytosol . The pH gradient ( 5 . 3 - - * 7 . 1 in our model ) endosome + cytosol is probably required in order to provide the energy for DT translocation , since ATP was not needed for the process . This ATP independence was also observed using the cellular sys - tem and metabolic inhibitors to reduce the ATP concentration by more than 90 % , but it could not be ruled out that the residual ATP concentration was sufficient to support trans - location ( 8 ) . In our case , when residual ATP was eliminated ( [ ATP ] < 0 . 1 nM ) by the use of an ATP - depleting system , ' " I - DT translocation was still observed . The poor temperature dependence we observed for DT translocation could partly explain why cells kept at 15 " C are still DT - sensitive ( 19 ) . The optimum cytosolic pH we found for DT translocation ( pH = 7 ) is the same as for most cytosols ( 28 , 34 ) . If the inhibition at low outside pH was reported before ( 3 ) , the one observed at higher pH is more surprising . Another example of the sensitivity of DT translocation to minor changes in pH is that a small endosome - pH difference , since it is situated just in the pH interval where DT translo - cation is the most pH sensitive ( on the cis side of the mem - brane ) ( 7 ) , seems to explain why DT translocation is more active from the more acidic late endosomes . DT Receptors on Resistant Cells Block the Toxin in a Trans - location - incompetent Form - Cells resistant to DT , like rodent cells , are known to have DT binding sites on their membrane ( 5 , 17 ) and to significantly endocytose DT ( 17 ) . We found that DT bound to BW mouse cells and was delivered to acidic compartments ( pH 5 . 2 ) . Using LDL density shift experiments ( 13 ) , we localized DT and Tf - DT in the same endosomes of BW cells ( data not shown ) . The sensitivity of these cells to Tf - DT indicates that the blockage of DT cytotoxicity is located at the translocation step and is not due to a peculiar property of DT - labeled endosomes . This could be directly demonstrated , since lZ5I - DT was found to be unable to trans - locate from BW endosomes . Natural DT binding sites on resistant cells are responsible for the observed inhibition of its translocation , since when an alternative binding site was provided via transferrin and its receptor , DT was actively transferred through the endosome membrane . This had been suggested previously but not dem - onstrated in studies showing that the absence of DT cytotox - icity to murine cells could be overcome by the use of Tf - DT ( 14 , 27 , 35 ) ( or DT - based immunotoxins ( 35 ) ) . Our data are also fully consistent with results showing that resistant mu - rine ( L ) cells only have inhibitory DT binding sites on their membrane ( which bind DT but inhibit the expression of its cytotoxic effect ) , whereas sensitive cells also bear a receptor which enables DT to intoxicate cells ( 5 , 36 ) . DT translocation was found to display similar characteris - tics when directly bound to its receptor on sensitive cells or to the transferrin receptor by the use of Tf - DT . It is not known why this finding should differ from that of previous studies in which DT bound to cells via the avidin - biotin system failed to produce intoxication ( 23 ) . One possibility could be the examination of the translocation at the plasma membrane level , since we found using plasma membrane preparations that some ricin conjugates are unable to cross this membrane , whereas they can cross the endosome mem - brane . ' The cell - free system described in this paper has enabled us to identify some requirements for the DT translocation proc - ess ( i . e . a temperature - and pH gradient - dependent selective transfer of the catalytically active A chain to the cytosol ) . This agrees with results from studies performed on whole cells ( 1 , 3 , 8 , 22 ) . Since ricin2 and Pseudomonas exotoxin3 were found to behave differently in the same cell - free trans - location assay , this reinforces the validity of this system for studying toxin translocation . We hope that in the future it will be useful to delineate the sequences of the toxins involved in this activity . Acknowledgments - We are indebted to Dr . Patrice Boquet and Prof . J . P .
