One family of capping proteins , whose prototype is gelsolin , shares modular architecture , mechanism of action , and regulation through signalling - dependent mechanisms , such as Ca 2 + or phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - phosphate binding . Here we show that proteins of another family , the Eps8 family , also show barbed - end capping activity , which resides in their conserved carboxy - terminal effector domain . The isolated effector domain of Eps8 caps barbed ends with an affinity in the nanomolar range . Conversely , full - length Eps8 is auto - inhibited in vitro , and interaction with the Abi1 protein relieves this inhibition . In vivo , Eps8 is recruited to actin dynamic sites , and its removal impairs actin - based propulsion . Eps8 - family proteins do not show any similarity to gelsolin - like proteins . Thus , our results identify a new family of actin cappers , and unveil novel modalities of regulation of capping through protein – protein interactions . One established function of the Eps8 – Abi1 complex is to participate in the activation of the small GTPase Rac , suggesting a multifaceted role for this complex in actin dynamics , possibly through the participation in alternative larger complexes . Spatially restricted turnover of actin filaments is crucial for eukaryo - tic cell motility 1 – 3 . Often , dynamic actin turnover is initiated by signals mediated either by extracellular cues , such as ligand binding to mem - brane receptors 1 – 3 , or by endogenous events , like rocketing of phos - phatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - phosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) - enriched vesicles or of invasive intracellular pathogens , such as Listeria monocytogenes and Shighella flexneri 4 . Amplification of these signalling cascades induces the formation of free barbed ends , the fast - growing ends of actin filaments , which elongate to form a polarized array of branched filaments produc - ing forces beneath the protruding membranes or the moving bacteria 1 – 3 . Capping proteins , which block the barbed end of actin filaments , are essential in these processes contributing to dynamic actin turnover 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 . Barbed - end cappers limit the length of filaments , increase the frequency of branches in lamellipodia , generating a stiffer meshwork 3 , control the location of force production by preventing unproductive actin polym - erization 7 , 8 , and arrest formin - based motility 6 . Signalling leading to actin - based motility is thought to regulate inter - action of cappers with barbed ends , thus providing sites where actin polymerization generates propulsive force 8 , 9 . The precise molecular wir - ing through which this is achieved , however , is poorly characterized . Eps8 , the prototype of the Eps8 - family proteins , participates in the transduction of signal from Ras to Rac , leading to actin remodeling 10 . Eps8 interacts with both the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos - 1 and the adaptor Abi1 in a multi - protein complex that also includes p85 , the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI ( 3 ) K ) 10 . Eps8 function resides in the C - terminal ‘effector’ region , which binds to Sos - 1 unmasking Rac – GEF activity , and associates with F - actin in vitro and in vivo 11 . How Eps8 is involved in regulating the architecture and dynamics of actin in motile processes is not known . Here , using in vitro actin polymerization kinetic and thermodynamic assays , biomimetic motility assays , and in vivo cellular models , we endeavoured to tackle these questions . Eps8 binds directly to F - actin 11 . In a co - sedimentation assay , the Eps8 C - terminal fragments 535 – 821 , 586 – 821 , 648 – 821 and 701 – 821 , but not the 535 – 733 fragment , bound to F - actin , indicating that the C - ter - minal ~ 100 residues of Eps8 are sufficient for binding to actin 11 ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a ) . Eps8 - 648 – 821 , the minimal frag - ment retaining all ‘effector’ functions 11 , bound to F - actin in a 1 : 1 molar ratio ( actin : Eps8 ) and with an affinity of 0 . 45 µM - 1 , which is consistent with binding of Eps8 to the sides of actin filaments ( Fig . 1a ; also see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1b ) . To define the role of Eps8 in the dynamic assembly of actin filaments better , we performed actin polymerization kinetic and thermodynamic 1 IFOM Istituto FIRC di Oncologia Molecolare Via Adamello 16 , 20139 , Milan , Italy . 2 Department of Experimental Oncology , Istituto Europeo di Oncologia ( IEO ) , Via Ripamonti 435 , 20141 , Milan , Italy . 3 Dynamique du Cytosquelette Laboratoire d’Enzymologie et Biochimie Structurales , C .

( a ) Binding to F - actin . Left , increasing amounts of recombinant and purified Eps8 - 648 – 821 fused to GST were incubated either alone ( 648 – 821 , top ) or with 1 µM of F - actin ( 648 – 821 + actin , bottom ) and subjected to co - sedimentation assay by high - speed ultracentrifugation . Each lane shows the supernatant ( S ) and the pellet ( P ) after ultracentrifugation . Detection was with anti - GST or anti - actin . Right graph : the equilibrium dissociation constant for binding of Eps8 - 648 – 821 to F - actin was calculated using the Lineweaver – Burk reciprocal plot , and is 0 . 45 µM . ( b ) The C - terminal fragments of Eps8 , but not the full - length Eps8 , inhibit actin polymerization by capping the barbed ends of actin filaments . Increasing amounts of purified Eps8 C - terminal regions ( 535 – 821 , 586 – 821 , 648 – 821 , 701 – 821 and 535 – 733 ) or the full - length protein were mixed to MgATP – G - actin ( 2 . 5 µM , 10 % pyrenyl - labelled ) and 0 . 25 nM of spectrin – actin seeds .

Depolymerization of actin filaments ( 2 . 5 µM F - actin , 75 % pyrenyl - labelled ) was induced by 30 - fold dilution into polymerization buffer in the presence of increasing amounts of Eps8 - 535 – 733 ( left ) , Eps8 - 648 – 821 ( right ) , or , when indicated , GST ( ctr ) , as a control .

Barbed - end growth of actin was potently inhibited ( up to 90 % ) by largely sub - stoichiometric amounts of Eps8 C - terminal fragments in spectrin – actin seeded - growth assays 12 , indicating that the inhibition of barbed - end growth is not the result of G - actin sequestration , but rather a blockage of barbed ends ( Fig . 1b ) . Similar results were obtained after cleaving the Eps8 - 648 – 821 fragment from the GST moiety ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1e ) . Under the experimental conditions , Eps8 - 648 – 821 is monomeric ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1e ) , indicating that dimerization does not contribute to its capping activity . Analysis of the data showed that Eps8 fragments 535 – 821 , 586 – 821 and 648 – 821 , but neither full - length Eps8 nor the amino - terminal fragment 1 – 535 ( not shown ) , block barbed ends 0 0 . 6 0 . 2 1 . 0 0 5 , 000 2 , 000 3 , 000 4 , 000 1 , 000 I nh i b i t i o n o f p o l y m e r i z a t i o n ( V 0 − V x ) / ( V 0 − V m i n ) Concentration ( nM ) Eps8Ls 0 200 800 400 600 PTB PTB PTB PTB SH3 SH3 SH3 SH3 C C C C a b 1 00 1 , 000 2 , 000 0 . 5 F - ac t i n ( µ m ) Eps8 - Cter ( nm ) L1 - 537 − 724 L2 - 551 − 716 L3 - 509 − 594 L1 - 537 − 724 L2 - 551 − 716 L3 - 509 − 594 E8 - 586 − 821 5 90 330 1 . 01 K d ( nM ) Figure 2 Eps8 family members function as barbed - end - capping proteins .

Increasing amounts of purified C - terminal regions of the various Eps8 - family members extending from the end of the SH3 domain ( L1 - 537 – 734 , L2 - 551 – 724 and L3 - 509 – 594 ) ( also see Supplementary Information , Fig . 4S for the alignments of all the Eps8Ls ) were incubated with MgATP - G - actin ( 2 . 5 µM , 10 % pyrenyl - labelled ) and spectrin – actin seeds ( 0 . 25 nM ) .

Notably , Eps8 - 535 – 733 , which does not bind to the side of filaments 11 ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a ) , exhibited a significant affinity for barbed ends ( K d = 200 nM ; Fig . 1b ) . Conversely , Eps8 - 701 – 821 , which contains the F - actin - binding site ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a ) did not cap barbed ends ( Fig . 1b ) , indicating that the most C - terminal residues are required but not sufficient for efficient barbed - end capping . High - affinity barbed - end capping was confirmed by inhibition of dilu - tion - induced depolymerization of filaments by the same Eps8 C - terminal fragment ( Fig . 1c ) . Notably , also the fragment Eps8 - 535 – 733 , which has no F - actin side - binding , inhibited dilution - induced depolymerization of fila - ments , albeit with a lower affinity for barbed ends ( Fig . 1c , left panel ) . Capping proteins establish the critical concentration of the pointed ends after complete saturation of barbed ends . Eps8 - 648 – 821 shifted crit - ical - concentration plots to a higher critical concentration ( 0 . 43 µM ) than that when barbed ends are free ( 0 . 1 µM ; Fig . 2a ; also see Supplementary Information , Fig .

S1c ) . To understand this result , steady - state measurements of F - actin assem - bly were performed at a constant concentration of F - actin ( Fig . 2a ) . The amount of F - actin initially decreased after addition of increasing amounts of Eps8 - 648 – 821 , consistent with the increase in critical con - centration owing to high - affinity barbed - end capping ( Fig . 2a ; also see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1c ) . Higher amounts of Eps8 - 648 – 821 caused an increase in F - actin , consistent with the decrease in critical con - centration of capped filaments owing to their stabilization by low - affinity binding of Eps8 to the sides of filaments ( Fig . 2a ) . Accordingly , the stabi - lizing effect of Eps8 - 648 – 821 was observed on gelsolin - capped filaments , and was also recorded using the Eps8 - 701 – 821 fragment , which does not cap barbed ends but still binds to F - actin ( Fig . 2a ; also see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1d ) . Conversely , no stabilization of actin filaments could be detected when using the Eps8 - 535 – 733 fragment , which does not bind to the side of actin ( Fig . 2a ) . Thus , the peculiar kinetic behav - iour of Eps8 in actin dynamics is the result of two opposite effects : first , the high - affinity barbed - end capping activity ( which causes an increase in critical concentration ) ; and second , low - affinity side - binding to F - actin ( which causes a decrease in critical concentration ) . Eps8 is the prototype of a family of proteins exhibiting a highly conserved C - terminal ‘effector’ region 13 , 14 ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S4 ) . This suggests that all the members of this family might be endowed with the ability to cap actin filaments . Consistent with this idea , the C - terminal fragments of Eps8 - family proteins capped filaments when tested in barbed - end seeded - growth assays , although the fragments had different affinities for barbed ends ( Fig . 2b ) . Thus , Eps8 and its related proteins define a new family of actin cappers characterized by an ‘effector’ core domain encoded in their C termini . 00 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 2 4 6 8 10 12 F l u o r e s ce n ce ( a r b i t r a r y un i t s ) Time ( min ) a b Eps8 Eps8 Abi Abi Phalloidin Phalloidin Phalloidin Phalloidin Abi1 + Eps8 Abi1 Eps8 GST 400 nM GST 400 nM ( no seeds ) Eps8 + GST 100nM Eps8 + GST − Abi1 100nM Eps8 + GST 200 nM Eps8 + GST − Abi1 200nM Eps8 + GST 400 nM Eps8 + GST − Abi1 400nM GST − Abi1 400nM Figure 5 Eps8 activity modulated by association with Abi1 .

We therefore tested the ability of the Eps8 C - terminal region to support actin - based motility in this assay . Eps8 - 648 – 821 and Eps8 - 535 – 733 , albeit at different concentrations , enabled the propulsion of N - WASP - coated beads when added to a motility medium containing actin , Arp2 / 3 , ADF / cofilin , profilin , but no cap - ping protein ( Fig . 3a ) . More importantly , the beads moved at similar velocity in the presence of either Eps8 - 648 – 821 or gelsolin ( Fig . 3a ; also see Supplementary Information , Movie 1 ) . Eps8 - 648 – 821 labelled with fluorescent Alexa 488 allowed localization of Eps8 throughout the actin tail ( Fig . 3b ) . Furthermore , when a pulse of Alexa 488 – Eps8 - 648 – 821 was added to the motility assay running in the presence of unlabelled Eps8 - 648 – 821 , fluorescent Eps8 - 648 – 821 incorporated first in a region close to the surface of the bead , where the actin tail is assembled by N - WASP – Arp2 / 3 . The fluorescent staining then gradually penetrated into the actin tail . These observations are consistent with capping of barbed ends occurring very shortly after the onset of filament branching at the bead surface ( Fig . 3c ) . Capping proteins are required in vivo for efficient motility , and are gen - erally enriched in cellular regions where there is high actin turnover 2 , 5 . Accordingly , Eps8 was found to be specifically recruited : first , to the tip of lamellipodia , where Rac - dependent actin polymerization ( required for membrane protrusion ) is initiated and controlled 11 ; second , at phagocytic cups during FC γ - ( Fig . 4a ) and collagen - mediated phagocytosis ( data not shown ) ; and third , along actin tails propelling PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - enriched vesicles ( Fig . 4b , e ) or intracellular pathogens , such as L . monocytogenes and S . flexneri ( Fig . 4c – d ; also see Supplementary Fig . S2a – e ) . Notably , actin tail formation does not require the activity of Rho GTPases 16 , 17 ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2f ) , indicating that Eps8 might par - ticipate in these processes independently of its ability to regulate Rac 18 . Consistent with the requirement for Eps8 in actin - based proc - esses , in eps8 - null fibroblasts there was a reduction in the number and length of actin - comet tails induced by PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production ( Fig . 4e , f ) ; this , despite the fact that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 does not affect Eps8 capping activity in vitro ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1g ) . Additionally , the speed of L . monocytogenes was significantly reduced in fibroblasts lacking Eps8 compared with those in which the expres - sion of Eps8 was restored ( Fig . 4g ) . Thus , the above results show that Eps8 is required in vivo to promote optimal actin - based motility . The question remains , however , as to how this activity is regulated , because full - length Eps8 does not cap barbed ends , indicating that the protein is auto - inhibited , at least in vitro . Post - translational events or protein – protein interactions could be involved in the activation of the holoprotein . Notably , full - length Eps8 is mainly dimeric ( Disanza , A . and Scita , G . , unpublished observations ) , a state that might negatively affect its barbed - end capping activity . Addition of Abi1 , which interacts with Eps8 , and which alone had no effect on actin assembly , elicited Eps8 barbed - end actin capping ( Fig . 5a ) , show - ing that association with Abi1 activates the capping activity of Eps8 , at least in vitro . The concentration of Abi1 required for half - activation of the barbed - end capping activity of full - length Eps8 in vitro is as high as 0 . 2 µM ( Fig . 5a ) . However , based on the fact that the K d of association between Eps8 and Abi1 is in the µM range 19 , we calculated the affinity of the Eps8 – Abi1 complex for barbed ends to be roughly 0 . 5 nM ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1f ) . This value is comparable to that of the isolated barbed - end capping domain of Eps8 . Additionally , the total concentrations of Eps8 and Abi1 in cells are 0 . 8 µM and 2 . 4 µM , respectively ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1f ) . Thus , the affinity of Eps8 – Abi1 complex for barbed ends seems high enough to have physi - ological relevance . These results do not rule out that additional in vivo events might be required to optimize the activation of Eps8 . Nevertheless , they indicate that Abi1 binding is a functional target of Eps8 . Consistent with the above in vitro data , the simultaneous expression of Eps8 and Abi1 , at levels comparable to that of the respective endog - enous proteins ( data not shown ) , in different cell lines was sufficient to induce the formation of GTPase - independent , F - actin - rich structures , where the two proteins localized ( Fig . 5b , and Supplementary Fig . S3a , b ) . Notably , these actin ‘spider’ - and ‘cable’ - like structures were highly motile ( data not shown ) and resembled actin - comet tails , consistent with the ability of Eps8 to reconstitute actin - based propulsion in biomi - metic assays . The Abi1 – Eps8 - induced structures were strictly depend - ent on the integrity of the association between the two proteins , because mutants of either Eps8 or Abi1 impaired in their ability to interact with each other 18 failed to induce the F - actin - rich ‘spiders’ and ‘cables’ ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3b ) . In summary , here we report the identification and characterization of a novel family of actin - binding proteins , the Eps8 family , that cap filament barbed ends , regulating actin - based motility processes . The core biological activity of this family of proteins is encoded within the conserved C - terminal region . This region does not share any sequence conservation with known capping proteins 20 , 21 , but it does have sig - nificant homology with the sterile α - motif ( SAM ) / Pointed domains ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S4a ) , which mediate homo - and hetero - dimerization , and protein – protein interactions 22 . This peculiar primary sequence is indicative of the unique properties and regulation of Eps8 as a barbed end capper . The cap - binding domain of the Eps8 family is also conserved through - out evolution . As reported in the accompanying paper 23 , the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans harbours a single gene coding for the homologue of Eps8 . Alternative splicing generates a long isoform , which contains the conserved C - terminal ‘output’ region displaying capping activity . More importantly , genetic removal of this isoform impairs the development and alters the spatial organization of intestinal microvilli , whose integ - rity depends on the proper architecture of the actin cytoskeleton 24 , thus requiring efficient capping of filament barbed ends . This provides genetic evidence for the role of Eps8 capping function in a whole organism . In mammals , however , the existence of Eps8 - family proteins working in a redundant fashion 13 , and with similar intracellular localizations ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3c ) , probably accounts for the lack of marked phenotypic alterations after disruption of the mouse eps8 gene 13 , 18 . Consistent with this , in mouse primary fibroblasts expressing only Eps8 and no other Eps8 - family proteins , genetic removal of Eps8 notably impairs actin - based propulsion . This phenotype was observed despite the existence of a variety of other barbed - end capping proteins 5 . This indicates that the subcellular localization of Eps8 by specific sig - nalling pathways is important for efficient cell motility , and that spe - cific functional properties can be ascribed to individual cappers 25 , 26 . Additional support for this comes from the observation that Eps8 activity is regulated by protein – protein interactions with Abi1 , raising the pos - sibility that signals affecting the dynamic formation and localization of this complex could ultimately affect actin - based motility . print ncb1199 . indd 1186 print ncb1199 . indd 1186 12 / 11 / 04 3 : 18 : 04 pm 12 / 11 / 04 3 : 18 : 04 pm © 2004 Nature PublishingGroup © 2004 Nature PublishingGroup NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 6 | NUMBER 12 | DECEMBER 2004 1187 L E T T E R S Our data also unmask a remarkable molecular versatility of the Abi1 – Eps8 complex . In addition to the role in actin capping presented here , Eps8 and Abi1 are part of a complex with Sos - 1 and PI3K , which pro - motes the activation of Rac 10 . Furthermore , Abi1 has been assigned a role in actin assembly downstream of Rac , affecting the site - restricted activa - tion of WAVE2 in a complex with Nap1 and PIR121 ( refs 27 – 29 ) . Finally , Abi1 binds to N - WASP 30 , suggesting a role in N - WASP - dependent actin dynamics . Thus , Eps8 and Abi1 seem to sit at the heart of a multilayered system of regulation of the actin cytoskeleton , raising the interesting possibility that they are engaged in multi - protein complexes that are not distinct entities , but rather are remodelled during signal propagation by the controlled replacement of subunits around core components that are maintained . This issue that warrants further investigation . METHODS Expression vectors , antibodies , reagents and cells . Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) - pro - moter - based and Elongation Factor - 1 α ( EF α ) - promoter - based eukaryotic expres - sion vectors and GST bacterial expression vectors were generated by recombinant PCR . pFastBac – His – Eps8 was used as a donor to generate recombinant bacmids according to the Bac - to - Bac system ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . pRK5 – Myc – PI4 , 5K was a gift from L . Machesky ( Birmingham University , UK ) . The C - termi - nal portion of Eps8L1 , L2 and L3 ( ref . 13 ) were obtained by PCR and cloned in pGEX vectors . All constructs were sequence verified . The antibodies used were : monoclonal anti - Eps8 ( Transduction Laboratories , Lexington , KY ) , rabbit polyclo - nal anti - GST , monoclonal anti - His ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) , anti - Myc 9E10 ( Babco , Berkeley , CA ) and monoclonal anti - actin ( Cytoskeleton , Denver , CO ) . The monoclonal anti - Abi1 antibody was generated against the pep - tide N - PPVDYEDEEAAVVQYNDPYADGDPAWAPKNYI - C . Toxin B was from Sigma ( St Louis , MO ) Immortalized fibroblast from Eps8 + / + and Eps8 – / – embryos , and the corresponding control re - expressing Eps8 were as described 18 . Protein purification . His – Eps8 FL was purified from Sf9 insect cells . Briefly , Sf9 cells infected with the appropriate virus were lysed in 50 mM Tris - HCl at pH 8 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 5 % glycerol , protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) , 1 mM NaF and 1 mM NaVO 4 . His – Eps8 was purified using Ni – NTA - agarose ( Qiagen , Venlo , Netherlands ) following standard procedures . Recombinant Eps8 fragments were expressed as GST fusion proteins in the BL21 Escherichia coli strain ( Stratagene , Cedar Creek , TX ) , and affinity purified using GS4B glutathione – sepharose beads ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech , Piscataway , NJ ) . Eluted proteins were dialysed in 50 mM Tris - HCl , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT and 20 % glycerol . GST – Eps8 - 648 – 821 was cleaved from the GST using the PreScission protease ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Actin was isolated from rabbit muscles and purified in the Ca - ATP – G - actin form by Sephadex G - 200 chromatography in G buffer ( 5 mM Tris - HCl at pH 7 . 8 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 1 mM DTT and 0 . 01 % NaN 3 ) 12 . Actin was fluorescently labelled with pyrenyl - iodoacetamide 12 . Human His – N - WASP was expressed in Sf21 cells 15 . The C - terminal domain ( VCA ) of human N - WASP was expressed as a recom - binant GST fusion protein and separated from GST by proteolytic cleavage 31 . Human ADF was bacterially expressed and purified 12 . Profilin was purified from bovine spleen , spectrin – actin seeds from human erythrocytes , and the Arp2 / 3 complex from bovine brain 12 . Recombinant GST – Abi1 was obtained as described 29 . GST – Eps8 - 648 – 821 was fluorescently labelled with Alexa 488 - C5 - maleimide ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) as described 32 . Alexa 488 - labelled Eps8 - 648 – 821 was tested in actin polymerization assays , and its affinity for barbed ends was five times lower than the Eps8 - 648 – 821 ( data not shown ) . Protein crosslinking . GST fusion proteins were crosslinked using bis ( sulphosuccinimidyl ) suberate ( BS 3 ) ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Actin polymerization assays . Actin co - sedimentation assays were performed as described 11 . Briefly , monomeric rabbit G - actin was induced to polymerize at 30 °C in F - actin buffer ( 5 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 8 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 and 100 mM KCl ) . Recombinant and purified GST - or His - fusion proteins or control buffer were subsequently incubated with F - actin and ultracentrifuged for 30 min at 400 , 000 g in a Beckman TL - 100 table - top ultracentrifuge . Equal amounts of starting materials , supernatants and pellets were solubilized in loading buffer , boiled , and resolved on an SDS – PAGE gel together with standards of actin and Eps8 proteins . Gels were scanned , and the concentrations of actin and Eps8 were determined by interpolation using the calibrated standards . Actin polymerization was monitored by the increase in fluorescence of 10 % pyrenyl - labelled actin . Seeded polymerization was induced by addition of 0 . 1 M KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 2 mM EGTA to a solution of Ca - ATP – G - actin ( 2 . 5 µM ) containing spectrin – actin seeds ( 0 . 25 nM ) and the desired amount of Eps8 . Fluorescence measurements were performed at 20 °C in a Safas Sfx or a Spex Fluorolog 2 spectrofluorimeter . The initial rate of barbed - end growth was measured . The affinity for barbed ends was derived as follows : the initial rate of polym - erization was taken as a measure of the free barbed ends at t 0 ( C 0 , equal to the concentration of spectrin – actin seeds at t 0 ) . The following equation was used to fit the data , in which [ C 0 ] and [ B 0 ] are the total concentration of barbed ends and of the Eps8 fragments , respectively , and K represents the equilibrium dissocia - tion constant of the complex of Eps8 with barbed ends ( CB ) . The fraction R of Eps8 - bound barbed ends is : R = [ BC ] / [ B 0 ] = ( ( V 0 – V C ) / ( V 0 – V min ) ) = ( [ C 0 ] + [ B 0 ] + K ± ( ( [ B 0 ] + [ C 0 ] + K ) 2 + 4 [ B 0 ] . [ C 0 ] ) 1 / 2 ) / 2 [ B 0 ] in which V 0 is the initial rate of polymerization in the absence of capping proteins , V C is the initial rate of polymerization in the presence of capping pro - teins at total concentration [ C 0 ] , and V min is the initial rate of polymerization in conditions of maximum inhibition ( determined experimentally ) . The following is the equilibrium dissociation constants ( K d ) for barbed ends of various Eps8 fragments ( amino - acid boundaries are indicated ) : Eps8 full - length ( 1 – 821 ) > > 1 , 000 nM ; 1 – 535 > > 1 , 000 nM ; 535 – 733 = 200 nM ; 535 – 821 = 0 . 8 nM ; 586 – 821 = 1 . 01 nM ; 648 – 821 = 0 . 45 nM ; 701 – 821 > 1 , 000 nM . Critical concentration plots were performed by serial dilutions of pyrenyl - labelled F - actin solution with free or gelsolin - capped barbed ends ( actin : gelsolin = 1 : 300 ) in F - actin buffer contain - ing Eps8 at the desired concentration . Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C . Measurements were carried out in a Spex Fluorolog 2 instrument . Dilution - induced depolymerization of pyrenyl F - actin was monitored in a Spex Fluorolog 2 instrument as described above . A 50 % labelled F - actin solution ( 2 . 5 µM F - actin ) was diluted 30 - fold into polymerization buffer ( 5 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 8 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 , 100 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 5 mM EGTA ) containing variable amounts of Eps8 . The affinity of Eps8 fragments for ADP - barbed ends was determined as follows . The initial rate of depolymerization V x decreased by tenfold after complete capping of barbed ends . The inhibition of depolymerization ( ( V i – V x ) / ( V i – V min ) ) , in which V i is the initial rate of depolymerization in the absence of Eps8 fragments , V x is the initial rate of depolymerization in the presence of an amount x of Eps8 frag - ments , and V min is the initial rate of depolymerization in conditions of maximum inhibition , was plotted against Eps8 - fragment concentrations and the affinity for ADP - barbed ends was calculated using the Lineweaver – Burk reciprocal plot ( Fig . 1d ) . In this representation , the concentration of filament ends was negligible compared with the concentration of capping protein ( [ BC ] < < [ C 0 ] ) . In vitro actin - based motility assay . Motility assays were run as follows . Polystyrene carboxylated beads ( 2 µm in diameter ) were coated with N - WASP and placed in a reconstituted motility medium 32 that consisted of 7 µM F - actin , 3 . 5 µM ADF , 2 . 4 µM profilin , 100 nM Arp2 / 3 complex , 50 nM capping protein ( gelsolin or GST – Eps8 - 648 – 821 ) , and when indicated Alexa 488 – Eps8 - 648 – 821 . An aliquot of 2 . 5 µl of the mix was placed between a slide ( Superfrost plus , Menzel - Gläser , GmbH ) and a coverslip , sealed with Valap ( vaselin : lanolin : paraffin 1 : 1 : 1 ) , and observed in phase contrast or in fluorescence using a CCD camera ( Hamamatsu ORCA II ER ) on an Olympus AX70 microscope equipped with a motorized stage ( Märzhäuser ) . MetaMorph 4 , 6 software for microscope control and image acquisition was used to calculate the speed of the beads in time - lapse experiments 32 . Transfection and immunofluorescence microscopy . Eps8 – / – cells were previ - ously described . Notably , removal of Eps8 does not lead to a reduction in the steady - state levels of F - actin content ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S4b ) . print ncb1199 . indd 1187 print ncb1199 . indd 1187 12 / 11 / 04 3 : 18 : 07 pm 12 / 11 / 04 3 : 18 : 07 pm © 2004 Nature PublishingGroup © 2004 Nature PublishingGroup 1188 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 6 | NUMBER 12 | DECEMBER 2004 L E T T E R S Cells seeded on gelatin were transfected with the indicated expression vectors using FuGene ( Invitrogen ) , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . After 24 h , cells were processed for epifluorescence or indirect immunofluorescence microscopy . Briefly , cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min , per - meabilized in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 and 0 . 2 % BSA for 10 min , and then incubated with the primary antibody for 45 min , followed by incubation with the secondary antibody for 30 min . F - actin was detected by staining with Alexa 594 - conjugated phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) at a concentration of 6 . 7 U ml – 1 . Transfected and control cells were plated onto coverslips and infected , as described , with either L . monocytogenes ( EGDwt ) 33 or S . flexneri 34 . Cells were then either fixed and subjected to immunofluorescence as above , or mounted in a closed Focht chamber ( FCS2 ; Bioptechs Inc , Butler , PA ) and analysed by video microscopy . Images of fixed and live samples were acquired with a back - illuminated , cooled charge - coupled - device camera ( TE / CCD - 1000 TKB ; Princeton Instruments , Trenton , NJ ) driven by IPLab 3 . 5 software and processed using Dias 3 . 2 , Scion Image 1 . 62c and PhotoShop 5 . 0 . 2 software for determination of velocity .

Following permeabilization with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , cells were then stained with rhodamine - phalloidin ( Sigma ) or anti - Eps8 antibodies to detect F - actin and Eps8 , respectively .

NATURE . COM / NATURECELLBIOLOGY Figure S1 Biochemical characterization of Eps8 as barbed end capper . a . Binding of various Eps8 fragments to F - actin . . Recombinant and purified Eps8 fragments ( 535 - 821 , 586 - 821 , and 701 - 821 , and 535 - 733 ) fused to GST ( 1 µM ) were incubated with 1 µM F - actin and subjected to co - sedimentation assay by high - speed ultracentrifugation . GST ( 1 µM ) alone was used as a negative control . Each lane shows the supernatant ( S ) and the pellet ( P ) after ultracentrifugation . Detection was by immunoblotting ( WB ) with anti - GST ab ( GST ) or anti - actin ( actin ) . b . Binding of Eps8 - 648 - 821 to increasing concentrations of F - actin . Recombinant and purified Eps8 - 648 - 821 fused to GST ( 1 µM ) was incubated with increasing amounts of F - actin ( 0 . 5 , 1 , 2 and 5 µM , respectively ) and subjected to co - sedimentation assay by high - speed ultracentrifugation as described above . Detection was by immunoblotting ( WB ) with anti - GST ab ( GST ) or anti - actin ( actin ) . c . Eps8 shifts the critical concentration of actin . Serial dilutions of F - actin ( 10 % pyrenyl - labeled ) were incubated alone ( blue squares , ctr ) , or in the presence of Eps8 - 648 - 821 ( 75 nM , pink squares ) or of different concentrations of gelsolin ( gelsolin / actin = 1 : 250 ; gray squares ) , and fluorescence was measured .
