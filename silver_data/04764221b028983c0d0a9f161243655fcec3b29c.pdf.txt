Klug ∗ Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering , University of California , Los Angeles , CA , 90095 , United States February 1 , 2008 Abstract As two - dimensional ﬂuid shells , lipid bilayer membranes resist bending and stretching but are unable to sustain shear stresses . This property gives membranes the ability to adopt dramatic shape changes . In this paper , a ﬁnite element model is developed to study static equilibrium mechanics of membranes . In particular , a viscous regularization method is proposed to stabilize tangential mesh deformations and improve the convergence rate of nonlinear solvers . The Augmented Lagrangian method is used to enforce global constraints on area and volume during membrane deformations . As a validation of the method , equilibrium shapes for a shape - phase diagram of lipid bilayer vesicle are calculated . These numerical techniques are also shown to be useful for simulations of three - dimensional large - deformation problems : the formation of tethers ( long tube - like exetensions ) ; and Ginzburg - Landau phase separation of a two - lipid - component vesicle . To deal with the large mesh distortions of the two - phase model , modiﬁcation of vicous regularization is explored to achieve r - adaptive mesh optimization . 1 Introduction Lipid membranes are a critical part of life because they serve as a barrier to separate the contents of the cell from the external world . Lipid molecules are composed of a hydrophilic headgroup and two hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains [ 1 ] , and will form a bilayer structure spontaneously by the hydrophobic effect when introduced into water in sufﬁcient concentration . Though the cell membrane has more complex structure , being littered with all kinds of proteins that serve as selective receptors , channels , and pumps , in this paper we will focus on closed spherical pure lipid bilayer membranes , i . e . , vesicles . Common experience reveals that it is much easier to bend a thin plate than to stretch it ( a good example is a sheet of paper ) . This is also true for lipid bilayer membranes , except that there’s no shear force because of the ﬂuid property of membranes . The mechanical energy of a lipid bilayer has three major contributors : bend - ing ( curvature ) of each monolayer ; area or in - plane expansion and contraction of each monolayer ; and osmotic pressure . Because the last two energy scales are much larger than the ﬁrst one ( by several orders of magnitude ) [ 2 ] , they effectively place constraints on the total surface area and enclosed volume of the bilayer membrane on experimental time scales ( up to at least one hour ) . Thus , the mechanically interesting energy arises from bending of the membrane . Canham [ 3 ] , Helfrich [ 4 ] and Evans [ 5 ] pioneered the development of the lowest - order bending energy theory , often referred to as the spontaneous curvature model , in which energy is a quadratic function of the principle curvatures and the intrinsic or spontaneous curvature of the surface . Incremental improvements to this model include the bilayer couple model [ 6 , 7 ] , which imposes the hard constraint on the area difference of the two monolayers , and the area - difference - elasticity ( ADE ) model [ 8 – 10 ] , which adds a non - local curvature energy term representing an elastic penalty on the area difference . The equations of equilibrium for the spontaneous curvature model , ﬁrst calculated by Jenkins [ 11 , 12 ] , are difﬁcult to solve being highly nonlinear fourth - order PDEs . The most common approach to modeling membrane ∗ Corresponding author : klug @ ucla . edu 1 mechanics numerically has been to discretize a vesicle surface by a triangle mesh , and approximate the curva - ture along mesh edges with ﬁnite - difference ( FD ) operators . Starting from some suitable initial shape , the FD approximation of curvature energy can be summed on the triangulation , and an adjacent local minimum then can be found by downhill minimization ( often via a conjugate gradient algorithm ) [ 13 – 16 ] . Another mesh - based approach , the ﬁnite element method ( FEM ) , was also recently applied to the study of membrane mechanics by Feng and Klug [ 17 ] , using C 1 - conforming triangular subdivision - surfaces elements to approximate the membrane curvature energy . One feature shared in common among these mesh - based methods is the need for stabilization of mesh vertex motions tangential to the discretized surface . This issue arises as a fundamental consequence of the use of a mesh for explicit coordinate parameterization of the geometry of a ﬂuid membrane having no physically meaningful ref - erence conﬁguration . As pointed out previously [ e . g . , 18 , 19 ] , the dependence of the curvature energy functional on the surface position map is invariant upon changes in parameterization . Physically this implies that in - plane dilatational and shear modes of mesh deformation carry no energy cost , and therefore , no stiffness . The addition of an artiﬁcial in - plane stiffness , for example by placing Hookean springs along the edges of a triangular mesh [ 18 ] does indeed stabilize these motions , but in doing so also changes the physics , yielding a model for a poly - merized ( rather than ﬂuid ) membrane . In order to allow for ﬂuid - like diffusion of membrane vertices , a number of researchers have used a dynamic triangulation approach , wherein the edge connecting a pair of adjacent trian - gles along one of the diagonals between the four associated vertices is swapped for the other diagonal . Within a Monte Carlo simulation framework this method yields mean - square vertex displacements that are consistent with microscopic diffusion [ 20 ] , and this approach has been shown to produce an effective viscosity that increases as the edge swapping rate decreases [ 21 ] . However , it is unclear whether the dynamic triangulation approach can enable unphysical in - plane forces to fully relax to zero in a zero - temperature energy minimization context as is adopted here . Alternatively , as shown in the ﬁnite element ( FE ) context [ 17 ] , tangential vertex motions may be suppressed partially by enforcing the incompressibility of the membrane as a local ( rather than global ) area constraint . This approach also allows for diffusion of vertices ; however , local enforcement of incompressibility can lead to severe distortion of elements in the mesh , and therefore hinders the simulation of large vesicle deformations . Further - more , local incompressibility does not completely suppress spurious modes , and though these degeneracies do not prevent simulation of unforced vesicle equilibrium , they can lead to catastrophic numerical instabilities when externally applied forces are introduced . Notably , these issues may be avoided entirely through the development of meshless numerical methods for membrane mechanics . Examples include , Ritz methods with global basis functions ( e . g . , spherical harmonics ) [ 3 , 22 , 23 ] , phase - ﬁeld methods [ 24 , 25 ] , and moving - least squares approximation [ 26 ] . Yet , these approaches are not without their own limitations ( e . g . , aliasing , difﬁculty with application of external forces ) . In this paper we propose a viscous regularization technique to stabilize tangential motions of nodes in a FE membrane model while enforcing incompressibility as a global constraint . We demonstrate the computational efﬁciency and effectiveness of this approach by comparing simulation times with and without regularization for shape transitions previously computed in [ 17 ] . Secondly , we examine the efﬁciency gained by enforcing the global constraints on membrane area and volume with an augmented Lagrangian approach instead of the previous penalty approach . Lastly , we apply the regularization and constraint methods to the simulation of two membrane shape change problems involving large deformations and the application of external forces . The ﬁrst of these problems is the simulation of the tether instability in a vesicle under tension between two opposing point forces ; the second is the simulation of separation and domain formation in a two - lipid - phase vesicle . In the latter we demonstrate how the viscous regularization technique can be slightly modiﬁed to formulate an r - adaptive remeshing method , wherein nodes “ﬂow” on the surface of the vesicle in such a way as to avoid element distortion . The outline of this paper is as follows : Section 2 brieﬂy introduces the FEM formulation for bilayer membrane mechanics along with artiﬁcial viscosity mesh stabilization and augmented Lagrangian constraint enforcement ; Section 3 shows two applications : tether formation and lipid phase separation , based on the methods described in Section 2 ; Section 4 concludes with discussions of results and future applications . 2 2 Methods 2 . 1 Lipid bilayer mechanics and ﬁnite element approximation We begin with a brief review of the mechanics of bilayer membranes and FEM approximation we use . For further details , the reader is refer to the paper [ 17 ] . Figure 1 : Geometry of a surface Membrane kinematics . The bilayer membrane is described as a two - dimensional surface M embedded in three - dimensional space ( Fig . 1 ) , parameterized by curvilinear coordinates { s 1 , s 2 } , such that its position is given by the map x : R 2 → R 3 . With standard deﬁnitions from differential geometry [ 27 , 28 ] we can span the surface tangent plane with both ( covariant ) basis vectors a α = ∂ x ∂s α ≡ x , α and dual ( contravariant ) basis vectors a α deﬁned such that a α · a β = δ αβ . The covariant and contravariant surface metric tensors are then a αβ = a α · a β , and a αβ = a α · a β , ( 1 ) and the determinant of the covariant metric tensor will be denoted a = det a αβ . ( 2 ) The normal to the surface is d ≡ a 3 = a 1 × a 2 | a 1 × a 2 | = a 1 × a 2 √ a . ( 3 ) The curvature tensor B is deﬁned by its covariant components b αβ = − d , α · a β = d · x , αβ = d · a α , β . ( 4 ) The mean curvature is one half of the trace of the curvature tensor H = 1 2 b αα = 1 2 a αβ b αβ = − 1 2 a αβ ( d , α · a β ) = − 1 2 a α · d , α ( 5 ) ( where a αβ is the contravariant metric tensor , deﬁned such that a αβ a αβ = δ αβ ) , and the Gaussian curvature is the determinant of the curvature tensor K = det B = det b αβ . ( 6 ) Lipid bilayer mechanics . We describe the energetics of the membrane by the Helfrich model [ 4 ] , which as - sumes a strain energy of the form E [ x ] = Z M 1 2 K C ( 2 H − C 0 ) 2 √ ad 2 s + Z M K G K √ ad 2 s ( 7 ) 3 where K C is the bending modulus and K G is the Gaussian curvature modulus . By the Gauss - Bonnet theorem [ 27 ] , the integral of Gaussian curvature is a topological constant R K G K √ ad 2 s = 4 π ( 1 − g ) , with g being the genus , i . e . the number of handles , and thus can be neglected . The weak form of equilibrium for the membrane can be obtained in general by the principle of virtual work , and for the case of conservative loads by minimization of total potential energy . The later dictates that the total potential energy by stationary with respect to any arbitrary admissible surface variation δ x δ Π ≡ δE − δW ext = 0 . ( 8 ) Here δE is the ﬁrst variation of the membrane bending energy , and δW ext = R M f ext · δ x √ a is virtual work done by conservative external forces f ext . A straightforward calculation [ 17 ] gives the ﬁrst variation of the total energy as δ Π = Z M (cid:2) n α · δ a α + m α · δ d , α − f ext · δ x (cid:3) √ ads 1 ds 2 , ( 9 ) where we have deﬁned stress resultants n α and moment resultants m α as n α = K C ( 2 H − C 0 ) a αβ d , β + K C 1 2 ( 2 H − C 0 ) 2 a α m α = −K C ( 2 H − C 0 ) a α . ( 10 ) Enforcing constraints : augmented Lagrangian method . Admissibility requirements on trial functions x and variations δ x include the satisfaction of any active constraints , such as the aforementioned constraints on total surface area and enclosed volume . Here we will enforce these constraints with the augmented Lagrangian ( AL ) approach ( see , e . g . , [ 29 ] ) . The AL method may be thought of as a hybrid between penalty and Lagrange multiplier methods . The basic idea of AL is to solve iteratively for a Lagrange multiplier , computing multiplier updates from a penalty term . To enforce constraints on both area and volume of a membrane , we establish a sequence of modiﬁed energy funcitonals , the n th of these taking the the form I n = Π + I con , where I con is a constraint energy term I con = µ V 2 ( V − ¯ V ) 2 − p n V + µ A 2 ( A − ¯ A ) 2 + α n A . Here ¯ A and ¯ V are the speciﬁed surface area and enclosed volume of the membrane , µ A and µ V are penalty parameters ( large and positive ) , and α n and p n are tension and pressure multiplier estimates for the n th iteration . Minimization of the modiﬁed energy ( holding multiplier estimates ﬁxed ) yields δI n = δ Π − p n + 1 δV + α n + 1 δA = 0 , where p n + 1 = p n − µ V ( V n − ¯ V ) and α n + 1 = α n + µ A ( A n − ¯ A ) are the updated multiplier estimates . Iter - ation of minimization followed by multiplier updates is continued until constraints are satisﬁed to within some preselected tolerance , TOL , as shown below in Algorithm 1 . In this way the modiﬁed energy converges to the pure Lagrange - multiplier constrained functional , with the added beneﬁt of avoiding the associated saddle - point problem , retaining a minimization structure which is convenient for nonlinear optimization algorithms . Whereas pure penalty methods require very large penalty parameters for accurate constraint enforcement , the AL iterative updates can achieve accuracy with much smaller penalty terms . In practice this is an important ad - vantage , since when the penalty parameters µ V and µ A become large , numerical minimization becomes difﬁcult as the Hessian ∇ 2 E ( or stiffness matrix ) becomes quite ill conditioned near the minimizer . This property makes minimization algorithms like quasi - Newton and conjugated gradient perform poorly , as ﬁnding the search direc - tions becomes difﬁcult [ 29 ] . However , small penalty parameters can produce a large number of AL iterations for convergence . Hence , it is common in practice to incrementally increase penalty parameters by some factor , FAC , after each AL iteration process to achieve faster convergence . These penalty parameter updates are also included in Algorithm 1 . Finite element approximation . A FE approximation is introduced by replacing the ﬁeld x with the approxi - mated ﬁeld x h deﬁned by x h ( s 1 , s 2 ) = N X a = 1 x a N a ( s 1 , s 2 ) ( 11 ) 4 Algorithm 1 Augmented Lagrangian method to enforce global area and volume constraints . Initialize : p 0 , α 0 , µ 0 V , µ 0 A , Set n = 0 repeat Minimize I n = Π + µ V 2 ( V − ¯ V ) 2 − p n V + µ A 2 ( A − ¯ A ) 2 + α n A Updates : p n + 1 = p n − µ nV ( V n − ¯ V ) , α n + 1 = α n + µ nA ( A n − ¯ A ) µ n + 1 V = µ nV × FAC , µ n + 1 A = µ nA × FAC n ← n + 1 until | V n − ¯ V | < TOL and | A n − ¯ A | < TOL where the N a ( s 1 , s 2 ) , a = 1 , . . . , N are shape functions of the FE mesh , and their coefﬁcients , x a are the positions of the nodal control vertices . Introducing this approximation into the modiﬁed energy funcitonal upon minimization leads to a set of discrete approximate equilibrium equations f int a + f con a − f ext a = 0 . ( 12 ) Here f int a are the internal nodal forces due to bending of the membrane , f int a = Z M " n α · ∂ a α ∂ x a + m α · (cid:18) ∂ d ∂ x a (cid:19) , α # √ ad 2 s ; ( 13 ) f con a are the constraint nodal forces due to the pressure and tension that are conjugate to the constrained volume and area , f con a = − p n + 1 ∂V ∂ x a + α n + 1 ∂A ∂ x a ; ( 14 ) and f ext a are the external nodal forces , due to the application of distributed loads on the surface , f ext a = Z M f ext N a √ ad 2 s . ( 15 ) Note that the integrands of the global expressions for internal and constraint forces are described in more explicit detail in [ 17 ] . Following that work , we again employ C 1 - conforming subdivision surface shape functions [ 30 , 31 ] along with second - order ( three - point ) Gaussian quadrature for the computation of element integrals . 2 . 2 Viscous regularization of tangential mesh deformation In the curvature model , the energy is determined by the mean curvature which is a parameterization - independent property of the surface shape , and thus is not sensitive to in - plane dilatational or shearing deformations of the surface FE mesh . Much like physical lipid molecules , FE nodes can ﬂow freely on the deformed surface . As discussed in [ 17 ] , this fact is manifested in the appearance of degenerate , zero - stiffness , zero - energy modes . Here we discuss the implementation of an artiﬁcial viscosity method designed to numerically eliminate these degenerate modes . For solid shells having both reference and deformed conﬁgurations , in - plane deformations ( dilatation and shearing ) can thus be expressed locally in terms of ﬁrst derivatives of the surface position maps of these two conﬁgurations . In curvature model , a well - deﬁned reference conﬁguration does not exist since the energy is only related to the deformed shape . The basic ingredients for stabilization of these tangential modes are the introduc - tion of a reference conﬁguration and an energy term elastically penalizing in - plane deformation away from this reference state . However , to retain the physics of the original model , the addition of any in - plane elastic energy must result in a variational problem possessing the same minimizing solution as the original problem . In other words , the artiﬁcial in - plane energy must attain a value of zero when the entire model is in equilibrium . To de - sign an algorithm that achieves these goals , we deﬁne a sequence of variational problems , minimizing a modiﬁed energy functional I n = Π [ x ] + I con [ x ] + I reg [ x ; X n ] ( 16 ) 5 where the reference conﬁguration X n for the n th iteration is the deformed solution x n − 1 of the previous iteration . The form of the regularization energy I reg [ x ; X ] can be chosen such that it vanishes when x = X , to ensure that solutions x n converge to minimizers of the original unregularized problem with increasing n . This regularization method is outlined below in Algorithm 2 . Algorithm 2 Viscous regularization via reference updates . Set X 0 = initial shape . Set n = 0 repeat Minimize I n = Π [ x ] + I con [ x ] + I reg [ x ; X n ] → solution , x n Update reference : set X n + 1 = x n n ← n + 1 until I reg [ x n ; X n ] < TOL Qualitatively , assignment of the reference conﬁguration for each iteration to be the current conﬁguration of the previous iteration results in a type of algorithmic viscosity , producing forces that resist the motion of nodes away from their position at each previous iteration . The quantitative details of this viscosity depend on the particular form chosen for the in - plane regularization energy , I reg . Here we give two example forms , the ﬁrst derived from planar continuum elasticity theory and the second representing the mesh as a network of viscous dashpot elements . Continuum elastic regularization energy . Here we treat the in - plane deformation response for each regulariza - tion iteration as that of a two - dimensional solid membrane . This local response can be modeled via a hyperelastic strain energy density , w ( F ) , which is a function of the surface deformation gradient F = a α ⊗ A α , ( 17 ) where A α are the dual basis vectors on the reference surface , i . e . , A α · A β = δ αβ , where A α = X n , α . Thus the regularization energy becomes I reg [ x ; X n ] = Z M w ( F ) √ Ad 2 s . ( 18 ) To preserve objectivity , the strain energy is a function of F through implicit dependence on the invariants of the surface - Right - Cauchy - Green deformation tensor C = F T · F = a αβ A α ⊗ A β [ 32 ] . As C is a rank - 2 tensor , the two non - zero principal invariants are I 1 = tr ( C ) = ¯ a αβ a αβ ( 19a ) I 2 = 1 2 { [ tr ( C ) ] 2 − tr ( C 2 ) } = 1 2 { ( ¯ a αβ a αβ ) 2 − ¯ a αµ ¯ a βν a αβ a µν } ≡ J 2 . ( 19b ) The strain energy density is thus a function of these two invariants w ( F ) = w ( I 1 , I 2 ) . As a speciﬁc example , consider a strain energy function that decouples the dilatational , and shear responses , as used by Evans and Skalak [ 33 ] to model the red blood cell cytoskeleton w = k 2 ( J − 1 ) 2 | { z } area change + µ (cid:18) tr ( C ) 2 J − 1 (cid:19) | { z } shear . Here k and µ are stretching and shear moduli , respectively . It should be carefully noted that although we follow here the formalism of solid mechanics , the reference conﬁguration X n is not permanent as for a solid ; rather the reference conﬁguration is iteratively updated so that the resulting stresses may relax to zero . 6 Dashpot regularization energy . The viscous character of our proposed scheme is much more obvious when we compose the regularization energy of contributions from Hookean springs placed along all element edges , namely , I reg = X edge ab k 2 ( ℓ ab − L ab ) 2 , ( 20 ) where ℓ ab = | x a − x b | and L ab = | X na − X nb | are the lengths of the edge connecting mesh vertices a and b in the deformed and current conﬁgurations , respectively . Differentiating this energy , the corresponding force on a node a from the spring connecting it along an edge to node b can be obtained as f ab = k ( ℓ ab − L ab ) n ab where n ab is the unit vector pointing from node a to node b . Recalling that the reference conﬁguration for the n th iteration is the same as the deformed conﬁguration of the n − 1 th iteration , the magnitude of this force can also be written as f ab = k ( ℓ nab − ℓ n − 1 ab ) . This is easily identiﬁed as the backward - Euler time - discretization of the force - velocity relation for a viscous dashpot f ab = k ∂ℓ ab ∂t , Thus , iterative reference updates of the form X n = x n − 1 have the effect of converting a network of springs into a network of dashpots , clearly revealing the viscous character of the regularization scheme . We have numerically implemented both the continuum elastic and dashpot regularization described here , and although both forms are effective in practice we have preferred the dashpot approach for its simplicity , efﬁciency , and robustness . The remainder of the paper focuses on the use of this second approach , demonstrating its effec - tiveness in application . 3 Applications 3 . 1 Shape vs . reduced volume Even in the absence of any externally applied loads , the two constraints on area and volume cause vesicles to transition among a variety of interesting equilibrium shapes . Here some of the calculations performed in [ 17 ] of the equilibrium shapes for different reduced volumes are repeated , as a ﬁrst demonstration of the effectiveness of viscous regularization . Reduced volume ν is a geometrical quantity deﬁned as ν = V ( 4 π / 3 ) R 0 3 , ( 21 ) where R 0 = p A / 4 π is the radius of a sphere with the area A of the vesicle . Reduced volume is then written as ν = 6 √ πV A 3 / 2 . ( 22 ) The reduced volume is the ratio of the current volume of the vesicle and the maximum volume that the current total area of vesicle can ensphere . For a spherical vesicle , the reduced volume ν = 1 ; a vesicle of any other shape has 0 < ν < 1 . To compute the following results , the spontaneous curvature model is used with C 0 = 0 . The modiﬁed energy is computed with loop subdivision shell elements and second - order ( three - point ) Gaussian quadrature , and minimized with the quasi - newton L - BFGS - B solver [ 34 – 36 ] . 7 Computational cost with and without the viscous regularization kR 2 / K C Total iterations ( initial shape → ν = 0 . 9 ) Total iterations ( ν = 0 . 9 → 0 . 8 ) 0 35 , 950 603 , 858 0 . 5 2 , 304 287 , 825 1 1 , 821 9 , 482 10 2 , 122 12 , 480 100 4 , 776 79 , 038 Table 1 : Viscous regularization improves the convergence rate of L - BFGS - B minimization . The ﬁrst row kR 2 / K C = 0 , shows the results without the viscous regularization , which are identical to the approach used in [ 17 ] . ( k : spring constant ; R : average radius of the vesicle ; K C : bending modulus . ) Viscous regularization . As a ﬁrst assessment of the beneﬁt of regularization , results are compared with the simulations done in [ 17 ] , in which local area and global volume constraints were performed by penalty method instead of AL method . First , the same calculation of [ 17 ] is repeated ; then the viscous regularization is added , with same kind of constraints ( local area and global volume constraint ) and penalty parameters ( µ A = 10 4 R 2 / K C for local area constraint and µ A = 5 × 10 4 R 2 / K C for global volume constraint ) . The calculation starts from an initial ellipsoid shape which has a reduced volume ν = 0 . 914 ( Fig . 2 ) . In the calculation , the area is ﬁxed at its initial value and the volume is reduced in order to satisfy the constraint on ν . For each simulation , violation of the volume constraint subjects the vesicle to a large pressure according to the penalty term in the functional . The energy is then relaxed by L - BFGS - B minimization and result in the equilibrium shapes . The iteration of of reference updates in Algorithm 2 is continued until the regularization energy is sufﬁciently small , I reg / I < 10 − 5 . In all the simulations , the same mesh , made up of 642 vertex nodes and 1280 elements , is used . The resulting equilibrium shapes for ν = 0 . 9 and ν = 0 . 8 are shown in Fig . 2 . Starting from the initial shape , the equilibrium shape for ν = 0 . 9 is computed by minimizing the energy ; then from the resulting ν = 0 . 9 shape , setting ν = 0 . 8 , the equilibrium shape for ν = 0 . 8 is computed . The computational cost with and without the viscous regularization is listed in Table 1 . As can be seen , the convergence rate is highly improved ( almost two orders of magnitude faster ) with the viscous regularization while the resulting shapes are equivalent . For different choices of spring constant k , the computational cost also varies . The computational cost has two contributions : one is the iteration number for each minimization ; the other is the number of reference updates required to satisfy the convergence criterion I reg / I < 10 − 5 . These both depend on k . For each minimization , the larger k is , the smaller the iteration number will be . While for the number of reference updates , it is opposite : the larger k is , the more reference updates needed . For example , to get the equilibrium shape ν = 0 . 9 from the initial shape , kR 2 / K C = 1 requires 2 reference updates , each of which costs ≈ 1000 iterations for minimization ; while for kR 2 / K C = 100 , there are 20 reference updates each costing ≈ 250 minimization iterations . In this case kR 2 / K C = 1 works the best , but the optimal k depends on the speciﬁc problem . In the later sections on tether formation , a much larger k ( kR 2 / K C = 1000 ) is used . Augmented Lagrangian constraint enforcement . From the results described above , viscous regularization is shown to be able to heavily lower the computational cost when a penalty method is used to enforce the constraints on area and volume . However , regularization also eliminates the need for local enforcement of incompressibility . Global constraints on area and volume can be easily implemented via the augmented Lagrangian ( AL ) method which is more efﬁcient than the previous penalty method . Here , the shape change from the initial ellipsoid shape to the equilibrium shape of ν = 0 . 9 is used to compare the penalty method with the AL method . In this test global area and global volume constraints are carried out ﬁrst by the penalty method with a range of penalty parameters , and secondly with the AL method . Viscous regularization is used for both the penalty method and the AL method . Iteration of reference updates is continued until the regularization energy is sufﬁciently small , I reg / I < 2 . 0 × 10 − 5 . The regularization spring constant k is set to be k = 10 K C / R 2 , where R is the average radius of the vesicle and K C is the bending modulus . For the AL method , the penalty parameters are initialized to be a fairly small number ( µ V = 10 4 , µ A = 10 4 ) , and are then increased by a factor of 2 for each of the following minimizations . The minimization continues until the constraints on area and volume are satisﬁed to within a tolerance and the 8 ( a ) Initial shape , ν = 0 . 914 ( not in equilibrium ) ( b ) ν = 0 . 9 without regularization . ( c ) ν = 0 . 9 with regularization . ( d ) ν = 0 . 8 without regularization . ( e ) ν = 0 . 9 with regularization . Figure 2 : Limit surfaces and control meshes of equilibrium shapes for ν = 0 . 9 and ν = 0 . 8 . regularization energy is sufﬁciently small . Viscous regularization reference updates are included with AL mul - tiplier updates in a single iteration loop . This hybrid regularization - AL algorithm , shown in Algorithm 3 , is a combination of separate Algorithms 1 and 2 . As the Table 2 shows , the AL method reduces the computational cost signiﬁcantly . This is especially true when high accuracy of the constraints is desired , in which case the penalty method requires extremely large parameters , which lead to conditioning problems that impede convergence of the nonlinear solver . Indeed , for penalty parameter > 10 8 , L - BFGS - B iterations diverge . In contrast , for the AL method to achieve high accuracy penalty parameters need not be very large [ 29 ] . 3 . 2 Tether formation A point - force acting on lipid membranes can pull out a long narrow tube commonly called a tether . This can be done by using micropipettes [ e . g . , 23 ] , optical tweezers [ e . g . , 37 ] , or even growing microtubules inside the vesicle [ 37 ] . The mechanical reason for formation of tethers lies in the lack of shearing modulus for membranes . Elongating in one direction and contracting in the other to such a spectacular way like tethers mechanically means extremely large shear deformations [ 38 – 41 ] . Since tether simulation involves very large deformations , the triangles in the ﬁnite element mesh are subject to severe distortions . In practice , as elements become more distorted , the zero - energy tangential modes can actually become numerically unstable ( Fig . 3 ) . Viscous regularization has to be added in order to suppress these zero - 9 Algorithm 3 Hybrid algorithm combining AL constraint enforcement with viscous regularization .

To achieve the same accuracy , the AL method requires fewer total iterations compared to the penalty method . More importantly , for extremely high accuracy ( < 10 − 7 ) , the L - BFGS - B minimization diverges with the penalty method , while the AL method still converges . energy modes . Furthermore , the critical force to pull out a tether is very sensitive to pressure and surface tension . Numerically , this necessitates highly accurate enforcement of the volume and area constraints . For a penalty method this implies very large penalty parameters , which lead to conditioning problems ( e . g . , Table 2 ) . For this reason , here the augmented Lagrangian method is applied . Figure 3 : The equilibrium shape of a vesicle of reduced volume ν = 0 . 9 with external forces ( ≈ 1 pN ) applied at the two ends ( forces not shown ) , mesh without ( left ﬁgure ) and with ( right ﬁgure ) the viscous regularization . Note that the unstabilized mesh is subject to element distortion even at small applied load . Starting from an initial equilibrium shape ( prolate ) , tether development is simulated by incrementally displac - ing nodes at the tips of the vesicle , and performing energy minimization resulting in the equilibrium tethered shapes for each extension . However , even with the viscous regularization , the mesh can still be distorted by the dramatic deformations experienced at larger extensions . Therefore , re - meshing is performed at intervals of the extension . Fig . 4 shows snapshots from a typical simulation for reduced volume ν = 0 . 9 . 10 Figure 4 : The tethering of a vesicle starting from a prolate of reduced volume ν = 0 . 9 .

For the shape in Fig . 4 ( c ) , the computed tether radius is not uniform along the extension direction , and r = 0 . 20 µ m is an estimate . As noted in the text a bending modulus of K C = 15 K b T is used for all calculations . Applied forces . The reaction forces conjugate to speciﬁed end displacements can also be calculated by simply adding up all internal forces of the ﬁxed nodes ( Eq . 13 ) . The force vs . end - to - end distance results for the vesicles in Fig . 4 are shown in Table 3 , with r the radius of the tethers ( µ m ) and bending modulus K C = 15 K b T [ 37 ] . Although an exact analytical solution for the force - extension relation is not possible , a simple analytical estimate [ 39 ] is used to compare with the computed results from the simulation . The estimate assumes that the thin tube ( tether ) is pulled out from a sphere , and the sphere remain unchanged during the pulling ( Fig . 5 ) . The analytical estimated force and surface tension are given as [ 39 ] : F = 2 π K C / r , ( 23 ) and the surface tension α = 0 . 5 K C / r 2 , ( 24 ) Figure 5 : Schematic of the tethered shape As Table 3 shows , for well developed tethered shapes ( end - to - end distance 11 . 6 and 12 . 8 µ m , vesicle ( e ) and ( f ) in Fig . 4 ) , the computed results and analytical estimations are very close . It is a notable advantage that the present simulation framework is also capable of force - extension calculations for shapes that are not as simple as the schematic in Fig . 5 . Although the present example is in fact axisymmetric , the algorithms are fully three - dimensional and can be applied to loadings and shapes lacking symmetry . 3 . 3 Lipid Phase Separation Membranes formed from different lipids can separate into distinct domains ( phases ) according to their chemical properties , leading to the formation of buds [ 42 , 43 ] . Baumgart et al . [ 44 ] found that their experiments are in good agreement with line tension theory [ 45 – 47 ] , which treats domain interfaces as discrete with an interface energy proportional to their length . An alternative , smooth - interface approach , based on traditional Ginzburg - Landau ( GL ) theory [ 48 , 49 ] can be used to also model phase separation [ 50 – 54 ] . One major drawback of the line tension model is that it requires the system to be pre - phase - separated into well - deﬁned domains , preventing the consideration of composition dynamics . Here a GL model for a multi - component bilayer with two different lipids in equilibrium is formulated , assum - ing that the vesicle is composed of a mixture of two lipids denoted A and B . In general , these two lipid types 12 Figure 6 : Double - well normalized GL energy ψ ( c ) = 16 c 2 ( c − 1 ) 2 used to model phase segregation in a two - component lipid system . may have different constitutive properties , as modeled by separate constitutive parameters : { K ( A ) C , K ( A ) G , C ( A ) 0 } for lipid A , and { K ( B ) C , K ( B ) G , C ( B ) 0 } for lipid B . Let the local concentrations of the two lipids be described by the concentration parameters c ( A ) , c ( B ) ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] with c ( A ) + c ( B ) = 1 . The local lipid concentration at point s = ( s 1 , s 2 ) can then be described by an order - parameter ﬁeld c ( s ) ≡ c ( A ) , which is referred to as the concentration ﬁeld or phase ﬁeld . The local constitutive properties of the membrane can then be modeled as functions of the phase ﬁeld with convex combinations of the pure phase parameters : K C = c K ( A ) C + ( 1 − c ) K ( B ) C ( 25a ) K G = c K ( A ) G + ( 1 − c ) K ( B ) G ( 25b ) C 0 = cC ( A ) 0 + ( 1 − c ) C ( B ) 0 ( 25c ) Thus rewriting the strain energy including explicit dependence of ﬁelds on surface position , E = Z M (cid:26) 1 2 K C ( s ) [ 2 H ( s ) − C 0 ( s ) ] 2 + K G ( s ) K ( s ) (cid:27) √ ad 2 s ( 26 ) where explicit dependence of the mechanical properties on surface coordinates s has been noted as a reminder of the heterogeneity of the system . The mechanics of the membrane are then dependent on both the shape of the vesicle and the lipid compo - sition . Minimization of the total potential energy now yields two sets of Euler - Lagrange equations , one being the equilibrium equations related to variations in the shape δ x , and the other being a phase equilibrium equation related to variations in the concentration δc . One further modiﬁcation to the energy functional is needed to build into the model of the physics of phases separation [ 49 ] . I = E + Z M ∆ E [ ψ ( c ) + ǫ 2 | ∇ c | 2 ] √ ad 2 s . ( 27 ) Here the normalized GL energy ψ ( c ) is a double - well potential such as ψ ( c ) = 16 c 2 ( c − 1 ) 2 ( see Fig . 6 ) which is minimized when the concentration c takes a value of either 0 or 1 , corresponding to local lipid concentration of either pure type A or pure type B . The parameter ∆ E scales the height of the barrier between the two minima of ψ ( c ) , and controls the energy cost of a domain interface . The second addition to the energy describes short - range cooperativity between neighboring lipids . The parameter ǫ is essentially a length scale which will determine the width of the region of transition between phases . As ǫ decreases to zero , this region will limit to a curve where the concentration gradient can be non - zero . Inclusion of this penalty term in the energy will then produce the effect of a diffuse line tension in the transition between regions of pure phases . In Baumgart’s experiment [ 42 , 44 ] , bending modulus K C ≈ 10 − 19 J , line tension σ ≈ 10 − 12 N , and the radius of the vesicle R ≈ 10 µm . Two vesicles from [ 44 ] are simulated : one with reduced volume ν = 0 . 98 , 13 phase B area fraction x B = ( 1 / A ) R cdA = 0 . 89 ; the other ν = 0 . 76 , x B = ( 1 / A ) R cdA = 0 . 56 , starting from the original spherical shape with two separate domains ( Fig . 2A and 2G in [ 44 ] ) . For the ﬁrst one ( ν = 0 . 98 ) , the simulation captured the small cap seen in the experiment ( Fig . 7 ) . But for ν = 0 . 76 , the mesh around the interface is distorted ( Fig . 8 ( a ) ) . Because the simulation starts from a sphere with roughly equilateral triangle elements , the shape change of vesicle causes the elements in the interface region to contract severely in the circumferential direction . This Element distortion needs to be suppressed because it can lead to inaccuracy and instability of the ﬁnite element simulation . In order to get a good mesh after the deformation , the elements near the interface need to contract in all directions so that they remain equilateral , resulting in a greater density of elements than other parts of the vesicle . To tackle such large deformations , remeshing strategies are often needed . The viscous regularization introduced in section 2 . 2 makes an r - adaptive remeshing possible , since reference conﬁguration can be arbitrarily formulated to reposition the nodes of the mesh . Here , a slight modiﬁcation of the dashpot regularization method is proposed with a reference updating strategy that drives elements toward equilateral shape . Given an element of the mesh at regularization iteration n − 1 with area A n − 1 , r - adaptive regularization at step n is deﬁned by placing springs on the three edges all of the same reference length ¯ ℓ n − 1 = 2 s A n − 1 √ 3 , i . e . , the length of a side of an equilateral triangle of the same area A n − 1 . Thus the regularization energy term for each triangle is written as E n = k 2 3 X i = 1 ( ℓ in − ¯ ℓ n − 1 ) 2 , ( 28 ) where the ℓ i are the lengths of the element edges . In principle this regularization energy could be applied to every element in a mesh . However , in practice these iterative updates are slow to converge to a fully relaxed state ( with zero regularization energy ) , and depending on the regularization constant k the method can get stuck in a state with ﬁnite energy stored in the springs . Hence , this “equilateral” form of the dashpot regularization is only applied selectively to poorly shape elements , all the other elements with the standard viscous regularization . A shape - criteria γ is then formulated to calculate different spring energy for different elements , γ = 3 X i = 1 ( ℓ i − ¯ ℓ ) 2 ¯ ℓ 2 . Using this measure of shape quality , the regularization energy is deﬁned for each triangle by E n = ( k 2 P 3 i = 1 ( ℓ in − ¯ ℓ n − 1 ) 2 , γ large , k 2 P 3 i = 1 ( ℓ in − ℓ in − 1 ) 2 , γ small . In other words , if γ is large ( say , γ > 1 ) for an element , it has poor shape and r - adaptive regularization is used on that element ; if γ is small enough , reference lengths are updated from the deformed lengths of the previous iteration as for the dashpot model described earlier . The addition of r - adaptive regularization has the effect of moving the nodes around on the membrane surface . In the present example of a phase - separated vesicle , this results in a ﬁner mesh near the interface area than elsewhere ( Fig . 8 ( b ) ) . For reduced volume ν = 0 . 76 , the simulated result is shown in Fig . 7 to compare with the experimental result . 4 Conclusions In this paper a framework for three - dimensional analysis of mechanics of lipid bilayer membranes is presented , based on the ﬁnite element method . Particular interest is focused on large deformation problems : tether formation ( Sec . 3 . 2 ) and phase separation ( Sec . 3 . 3 ) . The primary difﬁculty faced in FE simulation of ﬂuid membranes is the presense of mesh instabilities linked to the parameterization - independent nature of ﬂuid surfaces . Curvature models of vesicle mechanics depend 14 ( a ) Simulation ( b ) Experiment ( Fig . 2G from [ 44 ] ) ( c ) Simulation ( d ) Experiment ( Fig . 2A from [ 44 ] ) Figure 7 : Comparison of simulation and experiment for two component lipid phase separation .

Here a viscous regularization method is thus introduced to regularize tangential mesh deformations . In this method artiﬁcial reference conﬁgurations and corresponding in - plane energies are added to stabilize the tangential deformations ; reference updates are designed so that artiﬁcial energy converges to zero in order to retain the physics of the original model . Regulariztion of tangential mesh deformations eliminates the need for local enforcement of membrane in - compressibility [ 17 ] , providing a more convenient setting for augmented Lagrangian ( AL ) enforcement of global constraints on area and volume . The AL method can achieve higher accuracy with lower computational cost , compared to the penalty method . Large deformation problems can be very sensitive to mesh quality . Because of the physical meaninglessness of the reference conﬁgurations in the simulation , r - adaptive remeshing is easy to achieve in the context of viscous regularization , simply choosing a reference updating strategy which will reposition the nodes to get a better quality mesh . One promising direction for future work is to combine viscous regularization and r - adaptive remeshing with the dynamic triangulation approach [ 18 ] , in which the edge of a pair of triangles swaps to form less distorted triangle elements instantly . This could be a powerful approach , speeding up the otherwise slow movements of nodes driven by the viscous regularization . Also , the success of r - adaptive regularization relies to some degree on the quality of the starting mesh . If there are too many badly shaped element and the shape criteria γ tolerance is chosen to be too small , the mesh can sometimes lock with non - zero regularization energy , resulting in physically wrong shapes of vesicles . Dynamic triangulation could aleviate such locking . Lastly a r - adaptive regularized dynamic triangulation strategy could avoid the need for global remeshing in large deformation problems such as the tether simulations in Sec . 3 . 2 . Although the problems simulated in this paper are all axisymmetric , the model is really designed for fully three - dimensional calculations , and can thus deal with arbitrary geometries and loads . For example future ap - plications such as mechanics of organelles like mitochondria [ 55 ] and endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) [ 56 ] , with incredibly complex shapes may provide exciting opportunities for future study with these methods . 16 References [ 1 ] B .
