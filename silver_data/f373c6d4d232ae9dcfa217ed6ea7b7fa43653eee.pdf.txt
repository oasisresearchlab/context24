Van Vliet * ac Received 23rd September 2011 , Accepted 6th January 2012 DOI : 10 . 1039 / c2sm06825g Recent advances in contact mechanics have formalized approaches to distinguish between poroelastic and viscoelastic deformation regimes via load relaxation experiments , and to simultaneously extract the mechanical and transport properties of gels at the macroscale . As poroelastic relaxation times scale quadratically with contact diameter , contact radii and depths on the mm scale can require hours for a single load relaxation experiment to complete . For degradable materials such as biodegradable hydrogels and soft biological tissues , it is necessary to minimize the required experimental time . Here , we investigated the applicability of these methods at smaller ( m m ) length scales to shorten relaxation times . We conducted load relaxation experiments on hydrated polyacrylamide ( PAAm ) gels at the microscale via atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) - enabled indentation , as well as at the macroscale via instrumented indentation . We conﬁrmed the approach as a reliable means to distinguish between viscoelastic and poroelastic relaxation regimes at the microscale : shear modulus G , drained Poisson’s ratio n s , diffusivity D , and intrinsic permeability k of the gels agreed well at the micro - and macroscale levels . Importantly , these properties were accessed accurately within seconds at the microscale , rather than within hours at the macroscale . Our results demonstrate the promise of contact - based load relaxation analysis toward rapid , robust characterization of mechanical and transport properties for poroelastic gels and tissues . 1 . Introduction Instrumented indentation is a well - established approach to measure mechanical properties of materials . Initially utilized to characterize elastic and plastic properties of metals and ceramics , 1 such experiments have been applied more recently to characterize viscoelastic and poroelastic regimes in relatively more compliant materials including polymeric gels and so - called biological soft tissues . 2 – 10 Polymeric gels , consisting of a network of cross - linked poly - mer chains swollen with a solvent , are a class of gels with wide - spread application in which the solid network deformation and solvent ﬂow are coupled . Scherer 11 , 12 provided the analytical foundation 13 , 14 and a novel test 13 to obtain elastic and viscoelastic properties and permeability of aerogel beams during bending . However , this beam - bending approach is difﬁcult to implement for increasingly compliant materials ( Young’s elastic modulus E < 1 MPa ) . Hui et al . recently presented a contact - based theo - retical approach to extract simultaneously the mechanical and transport properties of hydrated gels via cylindrical punch indentation , 14 whereby the load relaxation response was related to the shear modulus , Poisson’s ratio , diffusivity , and intrinsic permeability of a gel . To extend this load relaxation approach to other indenter geometries , Lin et al . and Hu et al . utilized ﬁnite element analyses to obtain semi - analytical relations between the initial and fully relaxed load for a ﬂat rigid circular punch , 15 rigid rectangular punch , 16 and conical and spherical punches . 17 , 18 One important characteristic of gels and other ﬂuid - ﬁlled materials is that the mechanical response can depend on both the time scale and length scale of measurements . Since the time dependence of a linear viscoelastic response is independent of the contact diameter , whereas the poroelastic response is dependent on the contact diameter , the aforementioned approaches provide a means to distinguish between load relaxation resulting from viscoelastic relaxation of the gel network and that resulting from solvent ﬂow . In fact , Hu et al . 17 , 18 adopted a facile scaling means to identify dominance of the poroelastic deformation regime , so that experiments could be designed to extract both the elastic and transport properties of gels . To date , however , these methods have been applied only at the macroscale level for probe diam - eters on the order of cm .

This length – time scale coupling renders experiments quite time consuming , which constrains the range of material systems that can be studied . In particular , it is not feasible to analyze the poroelastic response of soft biological tissues or degradable gels that require mechanical analysis under hydrated conditions over durations that are longer than the degradation time scales that naturally affect the structure and properties . Further , macroscale analysis of poroelastic properties restricts treatment of materials such as striated tissues that exhibit structural transitions at smaller ( e . g . , m m ) length scales . Here , we sought to extend and validate the load relaxation approach of Hu et al . to smaller length and time scales , which would enable future studies on degrading or structurally heterogeneous gels and tissues . We compared analysis at the micro - and macroscale levels for a polyacrylamide ( PAAm ) hydrogel to determine whether poroelasticity could be identiﬁed as the dominant regime at the microscale , and to determine whether the elastic and transport properties could be extracted accurately and more rapidly than is possible at the macroscale . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 Materials Acrylamide stock solution was prepared by mixing 40 % w / v acrylamide , 2 % bis - acrylamide solution ( Bio - Rad ) and distilled water in a ratio of 1 : 2 : 2 . After degassing the solution for 20 min , gels were synthesized by adding initiators of 10 % w / v ammonium persulfate solution and N , N , N 0 , N 0 - tetramethylethy - lenediamine ( TEMED ) to the stock solution . For macroscale experiments , three different gels were cast into 60 mm diameter polystyrene Petri dishes to form a hydrated thickness of 1 cm . For microscale experiments , three different gels from the same batch synthesis were cast onto silane - treated glass slides . Prior to casting , glass slides were treated with 5 vol % glutaraldehyde , which was then aspirated and rinsed , to ensure that the gels adhered well to the glass substrate . Gels measured 22 mm (cid:2) 22 mm in - plane with a hydrated thickness of 500 m m . After 30 min gelation at room temperature , gels were submerged in phosphate buffered solution ( DPBS , Invitrogen ) and were maintained fully hydrated at 4 (cid:3) C for two weeks prior to testing to attain swelling equilibrium . 2 . 2 Macroscale load relaxation experiments Macroscale load relaxation experiments were conducted using a custom - built load frame with a force resolution of 50 m N and a displacement resolution of 1 m m , as described previously . 17 Experiments were conducted via a stainless steel spherical probe of 1 cm radius ( Fig . 1a ) . The instrument was programmed to approach the surface of PAAm gels at a rate of 2 m m s (cid:4) 1 , until a positive slope of the force – displacement response was recorded . Upon contact detection , indenter displacement was increased with a rise time of 2 s to attain three maximum indentation depths , h max ¼ 100 , 200 , or 400 m m . For each maintained depth , load relaxation measurements were acquired in triplicate over approximately 20 , 40 , and 110 h , respectively . Gels were fully submerged in DPBS solution in all experiments . 2 . 3 Microscale load relaxation experiments Microscale load relaxation experiments were conducted using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) - enabled indentation ( 3D Molecular Force Probe , Asylum Research , Santa Barbara , CA ) ( Fig . 1b ) . Spherical polystyrene cantilevers ( Novascan ) with a nominal probe radius of 22 . 5 m m and spring constant k of 14 . 0 N m (cid:4) 1 were used ; actual values of k were determined experimentally for each cantilever . 7 Upon automatic contact detection ( based on cantilever deﬂection ) , indenter displacement was increased at a velocity of 50 m m s (cid:4) 1 to attain three maximum depths , h max ¼ 4 , 6 and 8 m m . For each maintained depth , 45 replicate load relaxation experiments were acquired over 20 – 30 s , with a sampling rate of 250 Hz to acquire sufﬁcient data for accurate analysis . To examine repeatability and potential struc - tural heterogeneities at this lower length scale , n ¼ 45 replicate measurements at each depth were attained by acquiring ﬁve replicate measurements ( within an area of 80 m m (cid:2) 80 m m ) at three different locations on each of the three samples . 2 . 4 Analysis We adapted the method of Hu et al . 17 , 18 to analyze the acquired load relaxation responses . We summarize here the necessary equations to identify the dominance of the poroelastic defor - mation regime and the extraction of elastic and transport properties . After an indenter is pressed into a gel to a ﬁxed depth h , the force on the indenter relaxes as a function of time F ( t ) . At sufﬁciently short times , the gel behaves as an incompressible material because there is no time for ﬂuid to leave the network , while at extended times it acts as a compressible material . For a spherical indenter pressed into an incompressible elastic solid , the force on the indenter is given by : 19 F 0 ¼ 16 / 3 Gah ( 1 ) where F 0 is the resulting force at t ¼ 0 , G is the shear modulus , and a is the radius of contact computed from a ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ Rh p . The ratio of the initial force F 0 and fully relaxed force at long times F N is related to the Poisson’s ratio of the solid n s as : F 0 F N ¼ 2 ð 1 (cid:4) v s Þ ( 2 ) Fig . 1 ( a ) Apparatus for load relaxation experiments at the macroscale , using a stainless steel spherical probe of radius 1 cm .

Since the relevant length scale in this problem is the radius of contact a , the normalized time takes the form t / s where s ¼ D / a 2 is the characteristic relaxation time constant , and the force F ( t ) is given for a spherical indenter as : F ð t Þ (cid:4) F N F 0 (cid:4) F N ¼ 0 : 491exp (cid:4) 0 : 908 ﬃﬃﬃ s p (cid:3) (cid:4) þ 0 : 509exp ð(cid:4) 1 : 679 s Þ ( 3 ) where the magnitudes of prefactors were obtained by Hu et al . from ﬁnite element simulations . 17 In the present analysis , the dominant mechanism of load relaxation was determined by normalizing the force according to eqn ( 3 ) and the time by a 2 . The relaxation time of a material that behaves linear viscoelas - tically is independent of the contact diameter , whereas the poroelastic relaxation time is length scale dependent . Therefore , by normalizing time by the relevant length scale ( a 2 ) , it is possible to differentiate between these two regimes . In other words , if after normalizing time by a 2 , the normalized force – time responses collapse , it is inferred that poroelastic relaxation was dominant . The opposite is concluded if little or no length scale dependence is observed . To render this distinction , we conducted the following analysis for both the macroscale and microscale experiments : ﬁrst , we averaged the replicate load - relaxation responses at each maximum indentation depth ( n ¼ 3 indentation depths ) . This resulted in three output curves for data with only force being normalized ( Fig . 3a and d ) , and three output curves for data with both force and time being normalized ( Fig . 3b and e ) . Next , for a clearer manifestation of this distinction , for each type of normalization , we calculated the standard deviation among all of the replicate load - relaxation responses from the three indentation depths tested ( Fig . 3c and f ) . Note that the standard deviation among these responses is deﬁned here to reﬂect a measure of dispersion among relaxation responses measured for distinct maximum depths , while still including the experimental variation among responses at a given maximum depth . This approach serves as a means to quantify the effect of time normalization on the collapse of the response curves . For each time point , these standard deviations were calculated as : s ¼ 1 n X n i ¼ 1 ð y i (cid:4) y Þ 2 ! 12 ( 4 ) where n ¼ 9 for macroscale and n ¼ 135 for microscale experi - ments ( corresponding to all the replicate responses from all the indentation depths tested ) , y i represents the normalized force value at that particular time point for a particular output curve , and (cid:1) y is the average of all the normalized force values at that time point . Smaller standard deviation for a speciﬁc normalization scheme was interpreted as stronger collapse , allowing identiﬁ - cation of the dominant regime . Previously , other forms of force normalization were used to assist in this classiﬁcation . 17 , 18 Our rationale for departure from those approaches is addressed in the Discussion section . Since F 0 , F N and F ( t ) are known from the experiment , the only unknown parameter in eqn ( 3 ) is diffusivity D . To extract D , a custom - written optimization algorithm was used in MATLAB ( The MathWorks , Natick , MA ) to ﬁnd the best ﬁt of eqn ( 3 ) to the experimental force – time response . Intrinsic permeability k is then calculated from k ¼ D ð 1 (cid:4) 2 v s Þ h 2 ð 1 (cid:4) v s Þ G ( 5 ) where h is the solvent viscosity which is assumed to be equal to that of water ( 0 . 89 (cid:2) 10 (cid:4) 3 Pa s ) for PAAm gels . 20 The charac - teristic relaxation times for the micro - and macroscale experi - ments are listed in Table 1 . Unpaired t - tests were utilized to detect statistically signiﬁcant differences among the values obtained at different maximum indentation depths ( GraphPad Software , Inc . , La Jolla , CA ) . 3 . Results Figure 2 shows the experimentally measured load relaxation response obtained for PAAm gels at the macroscale ( Fig . 2a ) and the microscale ( Fig . 2b ) , indicated as the average among replicate experiments at each maximum depth . It is observed from these graphs that the time required for full relaxation exceeded tens of hours for macroscale experiments ( up to 110 h ) , as compared to a few seconds for microscale experiments . Macroscale contact radii ( 1 . 0 – 2 . 0 mm ) were three orders of magnitude larger than those in microscale experiments ( 9 . 5 – 13 . 4 m m ) . The length scale dependence of relaxation time is a clear manifestation of the poroelastic response . In contrast , linear viscoelastic relaxation is independent of the contact diameter . Therefore , by normalizing time by the relevant length scale ( a 2 ) , it is possible to differentiate between the poroelastic and linear viscoelastic regimes . This point is illustrated in Fig . 3 , in which load is normalized according to eqn ( 3 ) . At both the micro - and macroscale , normalization of the time by a 2 resulted qualitatively in the collapse of these responses onto a single curve ( Fig . 3b and e ) , and quantitatively to a lower standard deviation among the curves acquired at three different maximum depths ( Fig . 3c and f ) . This qualitative and quantitative assessment of the load relaxation responses conﬁrms that the poroelastic response is dominant for these gels at both the macro - and microscales . Mechanical and diffusive properties are reported in Table 1 , calculated according to eqn ( 1 ) – ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) . The excellent agreement in all calculated properties ( less than 20 % difference ) for experiments that analyzed the same gel over 10s of hours ( with cm scale probes ) and < 10s of seconds ( with m m scale probes ) validates the application of load relaxation analysis at the microscale . Note that the characteristic poroelastic time s is not constant for a given material ( i . e . , for a given gel or tissue ) but rather depends strongly on the deformation length scale deﬁned by the experiment ; here , s varied over ﬁve orders of magnitude for the range of contact radii a that varied over three orders of magnitude . 4 . Discussion In the present study we assessed the applicability of the method of Hui et al . , 14 as extended by Hu et al . , 17 , 18 to the study of m m scale experiments . Within the context of this theory , contact based measurements of stress relaxation provide a simpler means to determine the permeability and compressibility of gels , which would otherwise have to be obtained from independent measurements of shear modulus , longitudinal elastic modulus , 21 , 22 and diffusivity . 23 By appropriately analyzing stress This journal is ª The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 Soft Matter D o w n l o a d e d by M a ss ac hu s e tt s I n s tit u t e o f T ec hno l ogy on 15 F e b r u a r y 2012 P ub li s h e d on 15 F e b r u a r y 2012 on h tt p : / / pub s . r s c . o r g | do i : 10 . 1039 / C 2 S M 06825 G View Online relaxation experiments at the microscale using the above approach , the time required for experiments is greatly reduced , providing for convenient and reliable characterization of swollen gels and other classes of ﬂuid - ﬁlled porous materials . When an indenter is pressed into a gel , the load decays ( relaxes ) in a time - dependent manner . There are two distinct mechanisms of relaxation : viscoelastic relaxation as exhibited by dry elastomers , due to conformational changes of the polymer chains , and the ﬂuid - induced ( poroelastic ) relaxation ; a combi - nation of both relaxation mechanisms is also possible as seen in soft tissues and elastomers swollen with solvent . Pavesi et al . have reported a viscoelastic relaxation time of (cid:5) 3 ms for poly - acrylamide chains as measured by pulsed NMR spectrometry at a frequency of 38 MHz , 24 which is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than the poroelastic relaxation times reported here ; Weiss and Silberberg reported viscoelastic time scales of (cid:5) 0 . 09 to 0 . 16 s for polyacrylamide gels of similar concentra - tions . 26 While the relaxation times of a homogeneous material Table 1 Calculated shear modulus G , Poisson’s ratio v s , diffusivity D , intrinsic permeability k and characteristic relaxation time as a function of indentation depth for two probes of radii R 1 and R 2 .

In the present study , we designed experiments that accessed poroelastic relaxation as the dominant mechanism in the PAAm gels . This is in agreement with the ﬁndings of Galli et al . , 10 who showed better matching of microindentation ( R ¼ 400 m m ) load relaxation responses obtained for similar PAAm gels via ﬁnite element simulations assuming a poroelastic constitutive model as compared to a viscoelastic constitutive model . If the material behaved linear viscoelastically , one would expect to observe no differences in the normalized force decay as a function of different maximum indentation depths . However , Fig . 3a and d show that this is not the case for the present PAAm gels , at either the macroscale or the microscale . When addi - tionally normalizing time by a 2 , it becomes apparent in Fig . 3b and e that collapse of the responses onto a single curve is attained . This point is further underscored by the collapse of all of the normalized responses acquired at both the macroscale and microscale in a single graph ( Fig . S1† ) , spanning four orders of magnitude in contact areas ( m m 2 to mm 2 ) . Quantitative comparisons of this strength of collapse are enabled by calcula - tion of the standard deviation among the normalized responses , at both the macroscale and microscale ( Fig . 3c and f ) . Here , note that we have normalized force according to eqn ( 3 ) . We wish to contrast this approach to other approaches that normalize instantaneous force by ah or by the initial force F 0 . 14 , 17 , 18 This form of force normalization has been presented previously without comment ; 17 here , we recognize and discuss the advantage of this choice over other approaches . The normalization of force as shown in Fig . 3 makes no a priori assumptions about how G or n s of the material may vary as a function of indentation depth . In contrast , normalization by ah assumes that both G and n s are invariant with depth into a sample , and normalization by F 0 assumes that n s is invariant with depth . Fig . S2† demonstrates the misinterpretations that can result by normalizing force by ah , using our data on PAAm gels as an example : at the macroscale , a poroelastic - dominant response is inferred due to the stronger collapse for time expressed as t / a 2 ( Fig . S2a – c† ) , and at the microscale normali - zation by ah gives inconclusive results regarding the poroelastic dominance of load relaxation ( Figs . S2d – f† ) . That approach assumes G and n s are exactly constant with indentation depth , which we showed in Table 1 is not the case for the microscale experiments ; statistical analysis indicated signiﬁcant differences ( p < 0 . 0001 ) among the means of both G and n s obtained at the three different indentation depths . Galli et al . also noted , via comparison of experiments with ﬁnite element simulations , that G and n s were not identically constant with depth in similar hydrogels . 10 These differences could arise from experimental errors at small length scales due to underestimating the contact area or surface interactions between the probe and the sample . 25 However , even when such differences are statistically signiﬁcant but small ( < 10 % variation in G here among the three microscale indentation depths ) , this can directly affect conclusions drawn about poroelastic dominance . For example , that normalization approach falsely indicates that the poroelastic and viscoelastic relaxation times are similar—and that poroelastic relaxation mechanisms are not dominant—under microscale deformation of these hydrogels . Similarly , Fig . S3† shows that normalization by F 0 also gives inconclusive results regarding the poroelastic dominance of load relaxation , due to the assumption of constant n s . Thus , although we adopt a continuum framework which assumes implicitly that the mechanical and transport properties within the deformed material volume are homogeneous , we advocate the present approach of force normalization that refrains from making any implicit assumption regarding the magnitude of mechanical properties over greater length scales . Although there is a wide variation in levels of reported detail for polyacrylamide hydrogels ( e . g . , % crosslinker , % initiator , and vol % water at reaction initiation ) , we obtained properties that were in good agreement with those previously reported . For similarly prepared PAAm gels , Weiss et al . 26 reported elastic properties measured via force torsion pendulum - based viscoe - lastometry to obtain G 0 ¼ 0 . 3 – 6 kPa ; those authors separately measured transport properties in the same gels via ﬂuid shear ﬂow to obtain k ¼ 7 (cid:2) 10 (cid:4) 18 to 1 . 1 (cid:2) 10 (cid:4) 15 m 2 . This agrees well with our ﬁnding of G (cid:5) 7 kPa and k (cid:5) 4 (cid:2) 10 (cid:4) 18 m 2 via a single experimental approach ( Table 1 ) . Weiss et al . concluded that the network became less permeable as the gel concentration and crosslinking density increased . Since storage moduli are also related directly to gel concentration and crosslinking density , 27 this trend can explain the difference among permeability measured for different PAAm hydrogels . For example , Galli et al . 10 measured lower permeability ( k ¼ 5 . 6 (cid:2) 10 (cid:4) 20 to 1 . 2 (cid:2) 10 (cid:4) 19 m 2 ) for much stiffer PAAm gels ( G (cid:5) 100 kPa ) than those considered here . With the present method , we also found inter - nally consistent results between the properties obtained for identically prepared samples that were examined at the micro - scale over ( O ) 10 seconds and at the macroscale over ( O ) 10s of hours ; see Table 1 . Thus , this approach can now be extended reliably to the microscale , with markedly decreased experimental time . Note that although the elastic and transport properties are deﬁned by the solid and ﬂuid compositions of the hydrogel itself , the measured poroelastic relaxation time is also a function of the experimental length scales . This natural variation of s with length and the requirement that sufﬁcient relaxation occurs to enable ﬁtting of the relaxation response to obtain poroelastic properties give rise to important considerations of experimental design at the microscale . The key to achieving reliable results with this approach is ensuring that the poroelastic relaxation time extends well beyond the rise time t r ( i . e . , the time required for the instrument to reach the maximum indentation depth , after which measurement of load relaxation commences ) . We found that calculated relaxation times ( here , 0 . 6 to 1 s ) should be at least an order of magnitude larger than the shortest achievable rise times ( for our instrument , 0 . 08 – 0 . 16 s ) to capture sufﬁcient relaxation required for robust ﬁts to eqn ( 3 ) and thus robust property calculations . Generally , this minimum rise time corresponds to the maximum achievable displacement rates of a particular instrument , since true step displacements or step loads are not possible in practice . Thus , given t r we can estimate a lower - bound value for s to capture material relaxation response . Since s is a function of both diffusivity and contact area as s z a 2 / D , one This journal is ª The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012 Soft Matter D o w n l o a d e d by M a ss ac hu s e tt s I n s tit u t e o f T ec hno l ogy on 15 F e b r u a r y 2012 P ub li s h e d on 15 F e b r u a r y 2012 on h tt p : / / pub s . r s c . o r g | do i : 10 . 1039 / C 2 S M 06825 G View Online can estimate the contact areas required to maximize poroelastic relaxation times for a given material by assuming an initial estimate of diffusivity D . For the AFM - enabled load relaxation experiments conducted herein , the largest available contact areas and the shortest rise times ( fastest displacement rates ) were chosen to maximize the calculated relaxation time s and to minimize relaxation during the initial displacement to attain h max , respectively . To maximize the contact areas , we selected the largest AFM - cantilevered probe radius commercially available ( R ¼ 22 . 5 m m ) and a stiff cantilever ( k c ¼ 14 N m (cid:4) 1 ) ; the latter consideration increased the maximum accessible forces , and hence the maximum indentation depths , to result in larger contact areas and consequently in longer relaxation times . For materials of greater ﬂuid permeability than those considered here , the contact depths and / or probe diameter must be increased in order to capture the poroelastic relaxation response . In conclusion , we have demonstrated that the mechanical and transport properties of poroelastic materials can be measured via microscale load relaxation . This extension of macroscale analysis was enabled by designing experiments that accessed the poroe - lastic regime and identiﬁed this regime as the dominant relaxa - tion mechanism without making a priori assumptions regarding the properties of the material . As there exist no analytical solu - tions to indentation of a poroelastic half - space , previous demonstration of this method at the macroscale obviated infer - ence of such properties via ﬁnite element simulations or numer - ical implementation of the resulting boundary value problem . Our present validation of this approach for m m scale contact radii and contact depths signiﬁcantly reduces the required experiment time scale from > 10s of hours to < 10s of seconds . This decreased duration extends the applicability of contact - based analysis of poroelasticity to a wider range of materials , including synthetic hydrogels and biological tissues that can degrade quickly with time .
