Prockop , December 17 , 2001 Marrow stromal cells ( MSC ) can be expanded rapidly in vitro and differentiated into multiple mesodermal cell types . In addition , differentiation into neuron - like cells expressing markers typical for mature neurons has been reported . To analyze whether such cells , exposed to differentiation media , could develop electrophysiolog - ical properties characteristic of neurons , we performed whole - cell recordings . Neuron - like MSC , however , lacked voltage - gated ion channels necessary for generation of action potentials . We then delivered MSC into the injured spinal cord to study the fate of transplanted MSC and possible effects on functional outcome in animals rendered paraplegic . MSC given 1 week after injury led to signiﬁcantly larger numbers of surviving cells than immediate treatment and signiﬁcant improvements of gait . Histology 5 weeks after spinal cord injury revealed that MSC were tightly associated with longitudinally arranged immature astrocytes and formed bundles bridging the epicenter of the injury . Robust bundles of neuroﬁlament - positive ﬁbers and some 5 - hydroxytryptamine - positive ﬁbers were found mainly at the interface between graft and scar tissue . MSC constitute an easily accessible , easily expand - able source of cells that may prove useful in the establishment of spinal cord repair protocols . M ost , if not all , central nervous system neurons in mammals have the intrinsic capacity to regenerate a lost axon . The failure of axons to regenerate after spinal cord injury ( SCI ) has been attributed to growth - inhibitory molecules ( 1 ) , lack of appropriate trophic support ( 2 , 3 ) , and reactions of the immune system ( 4 ) . Glial cells produce growth - inhibiting molecules , such as Nogo ( 5 , 6 ) , MAG ( 7 ) , tenascin ( 8 ) , and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans ( 9 ) . Up - regulation of neurotrophic factors after SCI is limited ( 3 ) . The role of the immune system in SCI is complex but may include nerve growth inhibitory as well as stimulatory events ( 4 , 10 ) . Davies et al . ( 11 ) demonstrated long - distance regeneration of adult dorsal root ganglion cells , transplanted into spinal cord pathways , if a micrografting tech - nique was used to avoid local scarring . However , axon outgrowth was terminated or reversed upon contact with scar tissue . One approach to overcome some of the growth - inhibiting properties of the injured spinal cord is to transplant cells with protective and (cid:1) or reparative properties to the site of injury . Recently , mouse embryonic stem cells , delivered into the injured spinal cord , were shown to differentiate into neurons , astrocytes , and oligodendrocytes and to improve motor function ( 12 ) . However , recovery was limited . Also , the use of embryonic stem cells may not be generally accepted and heterologous transplantation may elicit graft rejection . Marrow stromal cells ( MSC ) constitute an alternative source of pluripotent stem cells . Under physiological conditions , they are believed to maintain the architecture of bone marrow and regulate hematopoiesis with the help of different cell - adhesion molecules and the secretion of cytokines , respectively ( 13 ) . MSC grown out of bone marrow cell suspen - sions by their selective attachment to tissue culture plastic can be expanded efficiently ( 14 , 15 ) and manipulated genetically ( 16 ) . MSC are referred to as mesenchymal stem cells because they are capable of differentiating into multiple mesodermal tissues , including bone ( 17 ) , cartilage ( 18 ) , fat ( 17 ) , and muscle ( 19 ) . In addition , differentiation into neuron - like cells expressing neu - ronal markers has been reported ( 20 – 22 ) , suggesting that MSC may be capable of overcoming germ layer commitment . Impor - tantly , MSC can migrate along known migration pathways when injected into corpus striatum of rats ( 14 ) . MSC migrated throughout forebrain and cerebellum , integrated into central nervous system cytoarchitecture , and expressed markers typical of mature astrocytes and neurons after injection into the lateral ventricle of neonatal mice ( 23 ) . We examined whether MSC expressing neuronal markers in vitro exhibited physiological properties characteristic of neurons . We then delivered MSC into the injured spinal cord to monitor survival , spread and differentiation of such cells , and their possible effects on the motor behavior of rats rendered para - plegic by SCI . Methods Primary Marrow Stromal Cell Cultures . MSC were collected from femurs and tibias of adult male Lewis rats ( Harlan Breeders , Indianapolis ) ( 16 ) . Rats were euthanized with a mixture of 70 % CO 2 and 30 % O 2 . Tibias and femurs were placed on ice in MEM with alpha modification ( (cid:1) - MEM ; GIBCO (cid:1) BRL ) containing 20 % FCS ( Atlanta Biologicals , Norcross , GA ) , 2 mM L - glutamine ( GIBCO (cid:1) BRL ) , 100 units (cid:1) ml penicillin , 100 (cid:2) g (cid:1) ml streptomycin , and 25 ng (cid:1) ml amphotericin B ( penicillin , strep - tomycin , and amphotericin ; GIBCO (cid:1) BRL ) . Epiphyses of femurs and tibias were removed , and the marrow was flushed out by using a syringe filled with medium . Bone marrow was filtered through a 70 - (cid:2) m nylon mesh and plated in 75 - cm 2 flasks . About 24 h after plating , supernatant containing nonadherent cells was removed and fresh medium was added . After the cells had grown to near confluency , they were passaged two to five times by being detached ( 0 . 25 % trypsin (cid:1) 1 mM EDTA for 5 min ) and replated at a density of (cid:1) 5 , 000 cells (cid:1) cm 2 . Preparation of the Retroviral Vector , Production of Viral Particles , and Genetic Marking of MSC . A retroviral construct encoding green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) as an expression marker and amino - glycoside phosphotransferase as a neomycin ( G418 ) selectable marker was prepared by using the LXSN vector ( CLONTECH ) ( 24 ) . Phoenix amphotropic packaging cells ( 25 ) ( ATCC ) were transfected with the LXSN - GFP plasmid by using calcium phosphate precipitation . Viral supernatants were collected 48 h after the start of the transfection , filtered through a 0 . 45 - (cid:2) m filter , and stored at (cid:2) 80°C for further use . Phoenix packaging cells were analyzed at the time of viral harvest for GFP expres - sion . One day before the infection of MSC with GFP - retrovirus , about 100 , 000 MSC were plated in 21 . 0 - cm 2 plates .

On day 2 , the infection procedure was repeated . On day 3 , fresh complete medium was added with 20 % FCS ( not heat - inactivated ) . On day 4 , cells were split 1 : 3 in 55 . 0 - cm 2 plates in complete medium containing 200 (cid:2) g (cid:1) ml G418 ( Sigma ) for a selection period of 14 – 21 days . MSC that had stably integrated the transgene survived and were expanded for experiments by passaging cells three to nine times . Attempts at Differentiation of MSC Toward a Neuronal Fate . MSC were plated as described ( 20 ) at a density of 2 , 500 cells (cid:1) cm 2 . On the following day , the medium was replaced with preinduction medium consisting of DMEM ( Sigma ) , 20 % FCS , and 10 ng (cid:1) ml basic fibroblast growth factor . After 24 h , the preinduction medium was removed , the cells were washed twice with PBS , and neuronal induction medium containing DMEM supplemented with 2 % DMSO and 200 (cid:2) m butylated hydroxyanisole ( 20 ) was added . In later experiments , we used DMEM with 5 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol ( 20 ) as an alternative neuronal induction medium for the same incubation times . Electrophysiological Recordings of Neuron - Like MSC . Whole - cell recordings were made of MSC exhibiting possible neuronal morphologies such as rounded cell bodies and distinct processes with growth cone - like terminal expansions . Such differentiated cells will be referred to as neuron - like MSC . Whole - cell record - ings were obtained by using a patch - clamp amplifier ( Axopatch 200 A ; Axon Instruments ) . The recordings had a series resistance ranging from 4 to 10 M (cid:3) that was compensated for electronically by 75 – 85 % . The resting membrane potential was assessed in current clamp mode . The residual capacity was removed , but the linear leak was not subtracted . To investigate the existence of voltage - gated channels , neuron - like MSC were clamped at (cid:2) 120 mV and currents were evoked by 100 - ms depolarizing voltage steps to (cid:4) 30 mV . The cells were perfused through a gravity - driven microperfusion system with the nozzle positioned close to the recorded cell . The control solution was used at room temperature and contained 140 mM NaCl , 4 mM KCl , 1 . 8 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 23 mM sucrose , and 10 mM Hepes . The pH was adjusted to 7 . 40 ; the osmolarity , to 310 mosM . Recordings were made with pipettes of 3 – 7 M (cid:3) filled with a solution containing 4 mM NaCl , 140 mM KCl , 0 . 5 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM Hepes , and 5 mM EGTA . The pH was adjusted to 7 . 40 ; the osmolarity , to 305 mosM . Membrane currents and voltages were controlled with appropriate software ( PCLAMP ; Axon Instruments ) . Current and voltage signals were sampled at 10 kHz . MSC Transplantation into the Injured Spinal Cord . A total of 38 adult female Lewis rats ( Charles River Breeding Laboratories ) weight - ing 250 – 260 g received a standardized contusion of the spinal cord and MSC treatment immediately or 1 week after injury . Laminectomy was performed at T9 under halothane anesthesia ( Fluothane ; AstraZeneca So¨derta¨lje , Sweden ) . The impact rod of the NYU device ( 26 ) was centered above T9 and dropped from a height of 25 mm . MSC grown under normal culture conditions were detached and resuspended with (cid:1) - MEM to a final concentration of 30 , 000 viable cells (cid:1) (cid:2) l as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion . Immediately , or 7 days after injury , animals received 5 (cid:2) l of a MSC suspension or (cid:1) - MEM delivered into the injury center and two 2 . 5 - (cid:2) l deposits , one 2 - mm cranial , and the other 2 - mm caudal of the central injection . A total of 300 , 000 cells or vehicle thus was delivered at a rate of 0 . 5 (cid:2) l per minute by means of a stereotaxic frame and a glass pipette with a tip diameter of 100 (cid:2) m configured to a 10 - (cid:2) l Hamilton syringe . Muscle and skin were sutured separately . Urinary bladders were emptied manually five times per day for the first week and twice daily thereafter . Antibiotics ( Borgal ; Hoechst Pharmaceuticals ) were given to prevent urinary tract infection . Two independent experiments with time - matched controls were carried out . A total of 16 rats received MSC ( n (cid:5) 8 ) or cell culture medium ( n (cid:5) 8 ) immediately after injury . A second group ( n (cid:5) 22 ) was treated with MSC ( n (cid:5) 12 ) or vehicle ( n (cid:5) 10 ) 1 week after injury . In both groups , behavior was assessed on a weekly basis , and histological examinations were carried out on animals eutha - nized 5 weeks after injury . All experiments had been approved by the Animal Research Committee of Stockholm . Behavioral Testing . Hindlimb motor function was assessed by using the open - field BBB scoring system ( 27 ) . Individual rats were placed on an open field ( 75 (cid:6) 125 cm ) and observed for 4 min by two observers . Hindlimb function was scored from 0 to 21 ( flaccid paralysis to normal gait ) . The test was carried out 1 day postoperatively and once every week up to the fifth week after SCI . Cell Quantification . GFP - positive cell profiles containing a distinct nucleus were counted in serial sections . Cell numbers were calculated according to the formula of Abercrombie ( 28 ) . Immunocytochemistry . Tissues and cells were processed for indi - rect immunocytochemistry ( 29 ) . Animals were deeply anesthe - tized ( Pentobarbital ) and perfused intracardially with 50 ml of Tyrode’s solution containing 0 . 1 ml of Heparin , followed by 200 ml of fixative ( 4 % paraformaldehyde (cid:1) 0 . 4 % picric acid in PBS ) . Spinal cords were dissected , postfixed in similar fixative for 1 hour , transferred to 10 % sucrose solution , frozen , and cut in a cryostat at 14 - (cid:2) m thickness . Longitudinal sections were col - lected from 18 - mm - long spinal cord segments containing the injury and injection sites and thaw - mounted on gelatin - coated slides . MSC were grown in chamber slides ( Lab - Tek ; Nunc ) and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min . Antisera raised in goats against fibronectin ( Calbiochem ) and GFP ( Rockland , Gilbertsville , PA ) or in rabbits against nestin ( kindly provided by Urban Lendahl , Karolinska Institute ) , laminin ( Sigma ) , GFAP ( Sigma ) , neurofilament ( NF ; Dahl , Chesnut Hill , MA ) ( 30 ) , PGP 9 . 5 ( Biogenesis , Bournemouth , U . K . ) , GFP ( Molecular Probes ) , and 5 - hydroxytryptamine ( 5 - HT ) ( Sigma ) as well as mouse mAbs to vimentin ( Dako ) , NeuN ( Chemicon ) , NF - 200 ( Sigma ) , and Map - 2 ( Sigma ) were used . Secondary antisera were conju - gated with FITC , rhodamine , or Cy5 ( Jackson ImmunoRe - search ) . Optimal dilutions were established for all primary and secondary antibodies . Controls included omitting the primary antibody . Slides were evaluated by using epifluorescence and confocal microscopy ( Radiance 2100 ; Bio - Rad ) . Statistical Analysis . Comparisons of cell survival were made by using an unpaired t test . Between - group comparisons for behav - ior were carried out by using the Mann – Whitney U test . Signif - icance levels were designated P (cid:7) 0 . 05 , P (cid:7) 0 . 01 , or P (cid:7) 0 . 001 . All values are given as mean (cid:8) SEM . Results Labeling and Characterization of MSC inVitro . Reliable detection by fluorescence microscopy of marrow stromal cells in culture and after transplantation was achieved by transducing MSC with a retrovirus encoding GFP . After a selection time of 14 days in medium supplemented with a cell - toxic concentration of G418 , only cells that had permanently integrated plasmids containing a neomycin selectable marker survived . The successful labeling of all surviving cells was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy . Genetically labeled MSC did not alter their morphology com - pared with native MSC . All analyzed cells ( n (cid:9) 500 ) were positive for fibronectin , vimentin , and laminin ( Fig . 1 A – C and 2200 (cid:2) www . pnas . org (cid:1) cgi (cid:1) doi (cid:1) 10 . 1073 (cid:1) pnas . 042678299 Hofstetter et al . Table 1 ) . In areas of high cell density , fibronectin - immunoreac - tive filaments were deposited extensively in the extracellular space ( Fig . 1 A ) . Immunoreactivity ( IR ) for the mesodermal - intermediate filament vimentin was dense in cellular processes and present in the form of a filamentous meshwork in cell bodies ( Fig . 1 B ) . A distinct subpopulation of MSC ( 37 . 5 % (cid:8) 1 . 2 , n (cid:5) 2 , 777 ) was nestin - IR ( Fig . 1 D ) . MSC were negative for the neuron - specific markers NeuN , NF , Map - 2 , and PGP 9 . 5 . Electrophysiological Properties of Neuron - Like MSC . In one experi - ment , we induced MSC with medium containing 2 % DMSO and 200 (cid:2) M butylated hydroxyanisole for 48 h ( 20 ) . However , patch - clamp recordings of these neuron - like MSC were not possible . This could have been a result of changes in the cell membrane caused by dramatic changes in the osmolarity from 646 to 310 mosM when the differentiation medium was replaced by the extracellular solution . In a second experiment , we differentiated MSC with medium containing 5 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol for 48 h . This treatment was compatible with whole - cell recordings . The resting membrane potential was (cid:2) 11 . 4 (cid:8) 8 . 7 mV ( n (cid:5) 8 ) . It was not possible to induce action potentials in any cell by application of depolarizing current ( Fig . 2 A ) . By using the voltage step protocol to activate voltage - gated currents , no inward currents could be elicited , indicating that the MSC did not express functional sodium channels . An outward currentamplitudewasfoundtobe203 (cid:8) 194 . 5pA ( n (cid:5) 8 ) ( Fig . 2 B ) . The low amplitude of the outward current and the presence of unavoidable leaks associated with the recording and leak currents make it very unlikely that the observed current represents a voltage - gated , outward potassium current . Hence , MSC differen - tiated by 2 - mercaptoethanol did not show typical neuronal prop - erties such as action potentials or voltage - gated Na (cid:4) and K (cid:4) currents and , therefore , are not mature neurons . Delayed Implantation of MSC into the Injured Spinal Cord Improves Functional Recovery . Immediate MSC treatment did not improve locomotor function , as revealed by BBB scoring ( Fig . 3 A ) . Delayed implantation led to significantly improved BBB scores ( 9 . 2 (cid:8) 0 . 5 ) compared with sham - grafted animals ( 7 . 9 (cid:8) 0 . 1 ) ( Mann – Whitney U test ; P (cid:5) 0 . 013 ) ( Fig . 3 B ) . Five weeks after injury , control animals could not support their body weight with their hindlimbs ( n (cid:5) 10 ) , whereas seven animals of the treatment Fig . 1 . Appearance of MSC in culture .

MSC infused immediately after SCI were found mainly in the periphery of the injury zone , whereas MSC transplanted 1 week after SCI were found in the whole lesion zone ( Fig . 4 A ) . Implanted MSC exhibited a bipolar morphology with long processes extending along the axis of the spinal cord . MSC formed bundles , which were arranged mainly along the long axis of the spinal cord , and provided bridges across the epicenter of the lesion area , which was filled with debris and macrophages . All implanted MSC expressed fibronectin - IR and a weak but distinct NeuN - IR ( ref . 31 , Fig . 5 , and Table 1 ) . Interestingly , implanted MSC had lost detectable nestin - IR ( Fig . 4 B and Fig . 6 ) as well as vimentin and laminin - IR ( Table 1 ) . Nestin and GFAP antibodies revealed the presence of two different kinds of glial cells in the injured spinal cord . GFAP and nestin - positive reactive astrocytes delineated the margin of the epicenter of the lesion with their tightly interwoven processes . In animals that had received a MSC infusion , astrocytic processes reached into the epicenter by penetrating MSC - bundles ( Fig . 4 C ) . A second population of cells was nestin - positive but GFAP - negative and , thus , similar to immature astrocytes ( 32 ) . These cells had migrated into the epicenter of the injury . In animals treated with MSC , immature astrocytes populated the MSC bundles and extended their delicate processes along the engrafted cells ( Fig . 4 B and Fig . 5 A – C ) . NF - positive fibers were preferentially found at the inter - face between MSC bundles and scar tissue ( Fig . 4 E and Fig . 5 D – F ) . Some of the nerve fibers associated with the implant - ed cells were identified as 5 - HT - positive ( Fig . 4 D ) . The intra - spinal MSC did not display GFAP , NF , MAP - 2 , or PGP 9 . 5 immunoreactivity . Discussion Our results further characterize MSC and demonstrate that MSC treatment can improve recovery of animals rendered paraplegic by SCI . Engrafted MSC form bundles and guide regenerating neuropil through the spinal cord lesion . MSC grown out of marrow cell suspensions by selective attach - ment to tissue culture plastic initially are not homogeneous but become morphologically more homogeneous with time in culture ( 33 ) by depletion of hematopoietic cells . However , the relationship between hematopoietic stem cells and marrow stromal cells is the topic of intensive research ( 34 ) . When neonatal mice incapable of developing cells of the myeloid and lymphoid lineages were trans - planted with whole bone marrow fractions from healthy donors , bone marrow - derived cells expressing NeuN and NSE were found within the central nervous system ( 35 ) . In a similar experiment , adult irradiated mice were infused with a whole bone marrow fraction . Cells engrafted in the olfactory bulb were immunoreactive for NeuN , NF , and Tuj1 ( 36 ) . However , these experiments did not determine whether the bone marrow - derived cells detected in the brain were derived from mesenchymal or hematopoietic stem cells . For our experiments , we used long - term MSC cultures containing mesenchymal stem cells selected on the basis of adherence to plastic . With the exception of a weak NeuN - IR seen in intraspinal MSC , neither neuronal induction in vitro nor environmental cues Fig . 5 . MSCbundlesguidehostneuropil .

By using confocal microscopy , reliable colocalization of mark - ers expressed by the GFP - labeled cells was possible . In culture , conditions all MSC displayed fibronectin , vimentin , and laminin - IR . Interestingly , a subpopulation of MSC expressed nestin , which is expressed during early stages of neurogenesis ( 37 ) and myogenesis ( 38 ) . Attempts were made to differentiate marrow stromal cells toward a neuronal fate . In addition to the two induction media published here , we tested media containing retinoic acid , brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( 21 ) , nerve growth factor , NT - 3 , glial cell line - derived neurotrophic factor ( GDNF ) , and forskolin ( unpublished data ) . However , none of these supplements improved the neuronal differentiation of MSC . Considering that differentiation of MSC into myoblasts has been reported ( 19 ) , it could be possible that the nestin - positive subpopulation of MSC differentiates spontaneously into an early myoblastic state during culture conditions . Five weeks after transplantation into the injured spinal cord , MSC had down - regulated vimentin , laminin , and nestin and begun to express a weak nuclear NeuN - IR , indicating that they had been instructed by environmental cues present in the injured spinal cord . Importantly , transplanted MSC formed bundles bridging the epicenter of the lesion filled with debris and macrophages . Regenerating host neuropil was associated with MSC aggre - gates , and , thus , a degree of cellular organization had been reestablished in the injury zone . Immature astrocytes , defined as nestin - positive and GFAP - negative cells , which are formed from stem cells in response to injury ( 32 ) , populated the MSC bundles . These cells might help promote nerve fiber outgrowth by offer - ing a growth - permissive surface . Growth of nerve fibers on the surface of astrocytes has been observed in other studies in which peripheral nerves ( 39 ) or fibroblasts secreting NGF ( 40 ) were implanted . Another explanation for the guidance of nerve fibers might be the abundant expression of N - cadherin ( 41 ) , which is known to enhance neurite extension ( 42 ) , on the surface of MSC . Importantly , we identified 5 - HT - positive nerve fibers along the MSC bundles . The 5 - HT - system of the spinal cord has been shown to be important in functional recovery after SCI ( 43 , 44 ) , and the apparent regeneration of 5 - HT elicited by MSC thus may be contributing to the observed improvement of behavioral recovery . From a clinical standpoint , it is perhaps particularly encouraging that delayed MSC treatment enhanced survival of grafted cells and exerted a beneficial effect on functional recov - ery . MSC infused immediately after SCI encounter a hostile environment characterized by ischemia , necrosis , and the pres - ence of potentially toxic compounds such as oxygen radicals and lytic enzymes . However , 12 h after SCI , maximal tissue loss is reached , leading to the next phase characterized by reactive gliosis , invasion of inflammatory cells , and reparative attempts such as up - regulation of basic fibroblast growth factor . Our data are indicating that this later phase of SCI is providing a more habitable environment for infused cells . Autologous treatment thus might become possible , avoiding graft rejection , the risk of viral antigens , and possible ethical concerns associated with other sources of stem cells . In summary , our results demonstrate that MSC survive well in the contused and severely pathological tissue present in the lesion after SCI and form physical , nerve fiber - permissive tissue bridges across areas of debris that are associated with a degree of long - term functional improvement .
