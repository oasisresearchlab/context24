Although MERS has low overall human - to - human transmission potential , there is occasional amplification in the healthcare setting , a pattern reminiscent of the dynamics of the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) outbreaks in 2003 . Here we provide a head - to - head comparison of exposure patterns and transmission dynamics of large hospital clusters of MERS and SARS , including the most recent South Korean outbreak of MERS in 2015 . Methods : To assess the unexpected nature of the recent South Korean nosocomial outbreak of MERS and estimate the probability of future large hospital clusters , we compared exposure and transmission patterns for previously reported hospital clusters of MERS and SARS , based on individual - level data and transmission tree information . We carried out simulations of nosocomial outbreaks of MERS and SARS using branching process models rooted in transmission tree data , and inferred the probability and characteristics of large outbreaks . Results : A significant fraction of MERS cases were linked to the healthcare setting , ranging from 43 . 5 % for the nosocomial outbreak in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia , in 2014 to 100 % for both the outbreak in Al - Hasa , Saudi Arabia , in 2013 and the outbreak in South Korea in 2015 . Both MERS and SARS nosocomial outbreaks are characterized by early nosocomial super - spreading events , with the reproduction number dropping below 1 within three to five disease generations . There was a systematic difference in the exposure patterns of MERS and SARS : a majority of MERS cases occurred among patients who sought care in the same facilities as the index case , whereas there was a greater concentration of SARS cases among healthcare workers throughout the outbreak . Exposure patterns differed slightly by disease generation , however , especially for SARS . Moreover , the distributions of secondary cases per single primary case varied highly across individual hospital outbreaks ( Kruskal – Wallis test ; P < 0 . 0001 ) , with significantly higher transmission heterogeneity in the distribution of secondary cases for MERS than SARS . Simulations indicate a 2 - fold higher probability of occurrence of large outbreaks ( > 100 cases ) for SARS than MERS ( 2 % versus 1 % ) ; however , owing to higher transmission heterogeneity , the largest outbreaks of MERS are characterized by sharper incidence peaks . The probability of occurrence of MERS outbreaks larger than the South Korean cluster ( n = 186 ) is of the order of 1 % . Conclusions : Our study suggests that the South Korean outbreak followed a similar progression to previously described hospital clusters involving coronaviruses , with early super - spreading events generating a disproportionately large number of secondary infections , and the transmission potential diminishing greatly in subsequent generations . Differences in relative exposure patterns and transmission heterogeneity of MERS and SARS could point to changes in hospital practices since 2003 or differences in transmission mechanisms of these coronaviruses .

Chowell et al . BMC Medicine ( 2015 ) 13 : 210 DOI 10 . 1186 / s12916 - 015 - 0450 - 0 Background The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS ) is a zoonotic pathogen that has caused recur - rent spillovers in the human population since March 2012 [ 1 ] . A total of 1 , 047 laboratory - confirmed cases of infection with MERS including 460 deaths have been reported in Saudi Arabia alone as of 15 July 2015 [ 2 ] ; the concentration of human infections in this region is thought to be linked to the local population of dromedary camels , which may serve as an intermediate host for MERS [ 3 , 4 ] . The human - to - human transmission poten - tial of MERS is thought to be subcritical [ 1 , 5 , 6 ] , although there is occasional amplification in the healthcare setting [ 5 , 7 – 11 ] . While sporadic importations of MERS to Europe , Africa , Asia , and North America via returning travelers from the Middle East had not sparked local outbreaks until recently , a single importation into South Korea on 4 May 2015 triggered the largest cluster of cases outside the Middle East to date [ 12 ] . The index patient was a 68 - year - old businessman who visited several coun - tries in the Middle East before returning to South Korea via Qatar [ 13 , 14 ] , where he developed respiratory symp - toms on 11 May 2015 . An accurate diagnosis of MERS was not established until 20 May 2015 , after the index pa - tient had sought treatment in several different healthcare facilities [ 13 ] . A total of 186 MERS infections in South Korea have been linked to the healthcare facilities visited by the index patient and subsequent infections . As a result of this large cluster , more than 6 , 000 contacts have been monitored in South Korea [ 13 – 15 ] . Although large - scale community transmission has not been reported for MERS , large hospital clusters are not infrequent and can amplify transmission , which aligns with the transmission characteristics of severe acute re - spiratory syndrome ( SARS ) , a related coronavirus that sparked global concern in 2002 – 2003 [ 10 , 11 , 16 , 17 ] . Coronaviruses associated with both syndromes have high affinity to the lower respiratory tract and cause severe pneumonia [ 18 – 20 ] , particularly among older adults with underlying medical conditions [ 21 , 22 ] . Both viruses are thought to be associated with some degree of trans - mission heterogeneity , indicating that super - spreading events are expected [ 23 , 24 ] . While the individual heterogeneity of MERS ( i . e . vari - ation in the transmissibility by individuals ) has been ex - plored recently [ 25 , 26 ] , here we focus exclusively on hospital outbreaks , where transmission is amplified . Fur - ther , we provide the first head - to - head comparison with SARS and carry out a comparative analysis of the trans - mission characteristics and exposure patterns of previ - ously reported hospital clusters of MERS and SARS to assess the unexpected nature of the recent South Korean nosocomial outbreak and estimate the probability of future large hospital clusters . Methods We analyzed a variety of epidemiological datasets to quan - tify the exposure patterns and transmission characteristics of MERS and SARS by disease generation and in different settings , including aggregated case counts , individual - level case data , and detailed transmission trees , as de - tailed below . Individual - level case data to quantify exposure patterns Middle East respiratory syndrome We analyzed a publicly available line list of MERS cases reported between March 2013 and May 2015 to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ( KSA ) Ministry of Health [ 2 ] . For each case , we obtained the date of reporting , health - care worker status , and whether the infection had been linked to healthcare facilities . Healthcare facilities in KSA report MERS cases to the Ministry of Health through an electronic case - reporting system once all appropriate test - ing is complete [ 27 ] . Case confirmation is based on la - boratory diagnosis through detection of viral nucleic acid or serology , regardless of the presence of clinical signs and symptoms [ 28 ] . Severe respiratory syndrome Total SARS case counts for Canada , China , Hong Kong , Singapore , and Vietnam including cases among health - care workers were obtained from the World Health Organization ( WHO ) website for the outbreaks in 2003 [ 29 ] . A probable case of SARS was defined as radio - graphic evidence of pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome on a chest X - ray , positivity for SARS virus in - fection by one or more laboratory assays , or autopsy findings consistent with the pathology of respiratory dis - tress syndrome [ 30 ] . A confirmed case was defined based on a positive laboratory test combined with clin - ical evidence compatible with SARS . Transmission trees to quantify transmission characteristics by generation time We obtained and analyzed detailed transmission trees for hospital clusters of MERS and SARS . Transmission trees provide information on the epidemiological links between successive cases and allow for quantification of the reproduction number , R , which is a key parameter in outbreak investigations . In general , R quantifies the transmission potential of an infectious pathogen , which informs the likelihood of large - scale outbreaks [ 31 , 32 ] . Estimates of R > 1 indicate the potential for an infectious pathogen to generate a major outbreak while R < 1 indi - cates that transmission of a given pathogen cannot be sustained in the population . Here , we note R g as the reproduction number at disease generation g , where g ≥ 0 . If g = 0 then R 0 denotes the index reproduction num - ber , or the number of secondary cases ascribed to the Chowell et al . BMC Medicine ( 2015 ) 13 : 210 Page 2 of 12 index case in a given outbreak . Overall , the reproduction number is a function of several inter - related factors , in - cluding the epidemiology of the disease , local cultural factors , and environmental conditions . Moreover , the reproduction number is affected by population behavior changes and control interventions occurring over the course of an epidemic . We defined hospital clusters as outbreaks that started in a healthcare setting with a hospitalized patient ( the index case ) and ended when the chain of transmission subsided and no further infections were linked to the healthcare setting . We searched for past MERS and SARS outbreaks with information on types of exposure . Specifically , we searched PubMed for articles on SARS published after 1 January 2003 with the search “ ( SARS AND hospital ) OR ( SARS AND healthcare ) ” and arti - cles on MERS published after January 2012 with the search “ ( MERS AND hospital ) OR ( MERS AND health - care ) . ” We also screened relevant articles cited within selected articles . Overall , we found information on types of exposure for nine hospital outbreaks ( three MERS and six SARS ) , while detailed transmission trees were available for four of these ( two SARS and two MERS clusters ) [ 11 , 13 , 14 , 16 , 17 , 33 , 34 ] ; an ill - defined SARS transmission tree from Taiwan had to be discarded . Each case within the hospital cluster was classified ac - cording to occupational and social exposure , including healthcare workers , patients , family members and visi - tors , and non - clinical staff . Healthcare workers were de - fined as personnel responsible for the direct care of patients and included physicians , nurses , laboratory technicians , and emergency medical personnel . Hos - pital personnel who do not directly work with patients were categorized as non - clinical hospital staff , a group that included janitors , clerks , ambulance drivers , and firefighters . Transmission tree of MERS hospital cluster in South Korea , 2015 We constructed the transmission tree of the South Korean outbreak , comprising 186 cases with the last case reported on 5 July 2015 . For this purpose , we employed publicly available detailed case data from the WHO , the Korean Centers for Disease Control , and the Ministry of Health & Welfare of South Korea [ 13 , 14 , 33 , 34 ] . The index patient developed symptoms on 11 May 2015 but was not diagnosed with MERS until 20 May 2015 . This nosocomial outbreak involved 15 healthcare settings . While exposure information was available for all cases , only 168 ( 91 % ) out of 185 transmission links tied to healthcare settings were ascertained through outbreak investigations . Transmission tree of MERS hospital cluster in Al - Hasa , Saudi Arabia , 2013 We obtained a transmission tree for a nosocomial MERS outbreak comprising 25 cases that occurred between 1 April 2013 and 23 May 2013 in Al - Hasa , Saudi Arabia [ 11 ] . This nosocomial outbreak involved four healthcare fa - cilities [ 11 ] . Transmission links were inferred for all sec - ondary cases comprising this outbreak except for one case . Transmission tree of SARS hospital cluster in Singapore , 2003 We obtained the transmission tree for a nosocomial SARS outbreak comprising 188 cases in Singapore be - tween 25 February 2003 and 11 May 2003 [ 16 ] . The index patient was a local resident who developed symp - toms in late February 2003 and was subsequently admit - ted to a hospital after returning from a holiday in Hong Kong . This nosocomial outbreak involved three major hospitals in Singapore [ 16 ] . Transmission tree of SARS hospital cluster in Toronto , Canada 2003 Detailed information was available on a nosocomial SARS outbreak in Toronto , Canada [ 17 ] , resulting in 90 cases between 23 February 2003 and 15 April 2003 [ 17 ] . The index patient was a traveler returning from Hong Kong on 23 February 2003 . This nosocomial outbreak developed in a single 249 - bed secondary case community hospital [ 17 ] . Infection control precautions were implemented throughout the hospital including the closing of the hos - pital to admissions , closing of the outpatient clinics , and quarantine orders to discharged patients [ 17 ] . Ethics MERS case data from Saudi Arabia were publicly available from the KSA Ministry of Health [ 2 ] . Similarly the dataset of MERS cases in South Korea was publicly available from the WHO , the Korean Centers for Disease Control , and the Ministry of Health & Welfare of South Korea [ 13 , 14 , 33 , 34 ] . All of the data were de - identified . These openly available datasets were generated as part of emerging out - break investigations and were , therefore , deemed exempt from institutional review board assessment . Analytical approach We tabulated the pathogen - specific frequency of healthcare and familial exposure using individual - level data and aggregated case counts . To evaluate differ - ences in exposure , we used chi - square and Fisher ’ s exact tests of independence in a cross - tabulation of exposure category and outbreak . Transmission trees allowed for tabulation of exposure frequency and num - ber of secondary infections by pathogen , individual out - break ( n = 4 ) , and disease generation — the time interval elapsed between successive generations of cases . Next , Chowell et al . BMC Medicine ( 2015 ) 13 : 210 Page 3 of 12 to quantify and compare the transmission potential and extent of transmission heterogeneity for MERS and SARS nosocomial outbreaks , we used an approach re - cently developed to characterize the distribution of cluster sizes for subcritical pathogens [ 35 ] . A hallmark of high transmission heterogeneity is a preponderance of very small and very large clusters ( the latter being associated with super - spreading events ) , together with a low frequency of intermediate - size clusters . Based on this approach , we fit a negative binomial to the distri - bution of secondary cases obtained from the MERS and SARS transmission trees and estimated the repro - duction number R and dispersion parameter k ( with lower values indicating higher heterogeneity ) [ 35 ] . Armed with these estimates , we simulated the expected distribution of future outbreaks that may occur in South Korea or else - where in terms of final size , peak size , and outbreak dur - ation . We used branching process models [ 35 ] to simulate 5 , 000 MERS - like and 5 , 000 SARS - like outbreaks based on the distribution of secondary cases inferred from empirical transmission trees . Each simulated outbreak was initiated with a single infectious individual . Results We analyzed the frequency of cases among healthcare workers for 973 MERS and 7 , 634 SARS patients ( Table 1 ) . The proportion of MERS cases among health - care workers was similar in Saudi Arabia and South Korea ( 13 . 4 % versus 13 . 5 % ) . The proportion of health - care workers among SARS cases varied from 19 % in China to 57 % in Vietnam , and was higher than that for MERS . The largest MERS outbreaks reported thus far have been greatly amplified in the healthcare setting , with the fraction of cases linked to hospitals ranging from 43 . 5 % for the 2014 outbreak in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia , to 100 % for both the 2013 outbreak in Al - Hasa , Saudi Arabia and the ongoing outbreak in South Korea ( Table 2 ) . The SARS outbreaks in Singapore , Toronto , China , and Vietnam were also primarily linked to health - care settings with the proportion of cases tied to hospitals ranging from 73 . 5 % in Singapore to 100 % in Toronto ( Table 2 ) . The transmission trees for the nosocomial MERS and SARS outbreaks are shown in Fig . 1 while the case pro - gression by disease generation and exposure category is shown in Fig . 2 . These outbreaks comprised only a few generations of infections , ranging from three to eight if the index case is considered to be generation 0 . For MERS , the exposure patterns did not differ between the outbreaks ( chi - square test ; P = 0 . 36 ; Fig . 3 ) , with the great majority of cases being patients ( 62 . 3 – 79 . 0 % ) followed by family members ( 13 – 21 % ) . In contrast , SARS affected a larger proportion of healthcare workers ( 33 – 42 % ) and family members ( 22 – 39 % ) compared to the MERS out - breaks ( chi - square test ; P < 0 . 001 ; Fig . 3 ) . There was no significant difference in relative exposure between the two SARS outbreaks ( chi - square test ; P = 0 . 2 ) . Of particular concern is the recent MERS outbreak in South Korea , which comprises a total of 186 cases in - cluding 25 healthcare workers , 116 patients ( including the index patient ) , 39 visitors or family members , and 6 non - clinical staff cases ( Fig . 1 ) . A total of 30 secondary cases have been linked to the index patient in the first generation of the disease , 124 secondary cases have been reported for the second generation , 24 cases have been identified for the third generation , and one case has been reported for the fourth generation . This leads to a rough empirical estimate of the reproduction num - ber according to disease generation of 30 for the first generation , 4 . 1 for the second generation , 0 . 2 for the third generation , and 0 . 04 for the fourth generation . The distribution of the individual reproduction num - bers varied across individual outbreaks ( Kruskal – Wallis test ; P < 0 . 0001 ) , and between MERS and SARS ( Wilcoxon test ; P < 0 . 0001 ) . The reproduction number for the index case ( generation 0 ) was high for three of the four outbreaks ( range 1 – 30 ) , including the ongoing out - break in South Korea ( Fig . 3 ) . The reproduction num - ber of the first two generations of secondary cases varied significantly for both SARS ( median = 2 , inter - quartile range 0 . 43 – 2 . 4 ) and MERS ( range 0 – 80 ) . For Table 1 Country - specific total number of cases and cases among healthcare workers for outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS ) [ 2 , 13 , 14 , 33 , 34 ] and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) [ 29 ] Coronavirus Time period Country Total cases Healthcare workers ( % ) MERS 20 May – 5 Jul 2015 South Korea 186 25 ( 13 . 4 ) MERS Jan 2013 – May 2015 Saudi Arabia 787 106 ( 13 . 5 ) SARS 23 Feb – 12 Jun 2003 Canada 251 109 ( 43 . 4 ) SARS 16 Nov – 3 Jun 2003 China 5 , 327 1 , 002 ( 18 . 8 ) SARS 15 Feb – 31 May 2003 Hong Kong 1 , 755 386 ( 22 . 0 ) SARS 25 Feb – 5 May 2003 Singapore 238 97 ( 40 . 8 ) SARS 23 Feb – 14 Apr 2003 Vietnam 63 36 ( 57 . 1 ) Information based on publicly available nationally aggregated case counts and patient - level data Chowell et al . BMC Medicine ( 2015 ) 13 : 210 Page 4 of 12 MERS , the reproduction number dropped below 1 . 0 in generation 2 for the outbreak in South Korea and gen - eration 3 for the outbreak in Al - Hasa , whereas it did not drop below 1 . 0 until generation 4 for SARS ( Fig . 4 ) . Importantly , for MERS , a large proportion of the sec - ondary cases were among patients visiting the same hospital facilities as the index patient in South Korea ( 69 % ) and Al - Hasa , Saudi Arabia ( 100 % ) . Exposure categories were more balanced for SARS , with 47 – 57 % of secondary cases among healthcare workers , 24 – 30 % among visitors and family members , and 14 – 19 % among patients ( Fig . 3 ) . Based on the transmission trees , one can identify several early super - spreading events fueling these out - breaks . The MERS outbreak in South Korea was char - acterized by three such events , the index patient who infected 30 secondary cases , and two patient cases of the second generation who infected 80 and 23 sec - ondary cases each . In the MERS outbreak in Al - Hasa , Saudi Arabia , one patient infected seven other pa - tients in the same hospital . The SARS outbreak in Singapore was associated with six super - spreading events of at least seven secondary cases each , whereas the SARS outbreak in Toronto was characterized by four super - spreading events of at least seven second - ary cases each . Next , we quantified transmission heterogeneity in these nosocomial outbreaks through the dispersion par - ameter k , which in turn allowed us to predict the size of future outbreaks of MERS ( or SARS , should it reappear ) . By fitting a negative binomial distribution to the number of secondary cases in empirical transmission trees of realized outbreaks , we derived estimates of the mean reproduction number and the dispersion parameter ( Table 3 ) . The reproduction number indicates the aver - age number of secondary cases per index case , while the dispersion parameter quantifies the degree of heterogen - eity in the distribution of secondary cases . A lower value of k indicates more pronounced heterogeneity . Both MERS and SARS had reproduction numbers close to 1 . 0 in the hospital setting , although the estimate for MERS had broad confidence intervals , presumably due to smaller sample size . We found the dispersion parameter for MERS to be significantly lower than that for SARS , indicating higher heterogeneity in the distribution of secondary cases for nosocomial MERS outbreaks com - pared to SARS , and , in turn , a higher probability of super - spreading events of higher magnitude for MERS . Outbreak simulations for both MERS and SARS showed marked variability in outbreak characteristics , with the distribution of outbreak size , peak size , and out - break duration following power - laws ( Fig . 5 ) . Figure 6 displays the scope of outbreak size and duration for MERS and SARS directly derived from the joint prob - ability distribution of outbreak outcomes . For illustration purposes , the probability of a future outbreak greater than 100 cases is 1 . 2 % for MERS and 2 . 3 % for SARS . The higher transmission heterogeneity of MERS mani - fests itself by a more skewed distribution of outbreak sizes and sharper peaks expected during the largest out - breaks , relative to SARS ( Fig . 5 ) . While the great majority of outbreak simulations only comprised a few cases ( Fig . 5 ) , a few outbreak simula - tions for both MERS and SARS demonstrate the poten - tial for multi - modal outbreaks characterized by larger total size and duration that result from low - probability super - spreading events ( Additional file 1 : Figs . S1 and S2 ) . Moreover , these simulations are consistent with observed multi - modal outbreak curves for SARS and MERS as shown in Additional file 1 : Fig . S3 . Overall , multi - modal outbreaks of MERS tend to have higher peak size but shorter duration .

BMC Medicine ( 2015 ) 13 : 210 Page 5 of 12 Discussion This is the first head - to - head comparison of exposure and transmission patterns of large hospital clusters of MERS and SARS , with a focus on the recent May – July 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea . Nosocomial outbreaks of both diseases were characterized by high transmission het - erogeneity , with three to six super - spreading events identi - fied during the early stages of transmission . Intriguingly , there was a systematic difference in the exposure patterns of MERS and SARS , with a majority of MERS cases occur - ring among patients who sought care in the same facilities as the index case , and a greater concentration of SARS cases among healthcare workers throughout the outbreak . Exposure patterns differed slightly by disease generation , however , especially for SARS . Although the number of hospital outbreaks available for study remains limited , comparison of the distribution of secondary cases suggests a similar transmission potential within the hospital for both viruses ( R 0 close to 1 . 0 ) , but greater transmission heterogeneity for MERS than SARS . Our study suggests that the South Korean outbreak follows a similar progres - sion to previously described hospital clusters involving coronaviruses . In these clusters , an early super - spreading event linked to a single hospitalized index case generated a disproportionate number of infections , while the transmis - sion potential diminished greatly in subsequent genera - tions , indicating a significant effect of active case detection and control interventions . Our simulations suggest that the probability of a future hospital outbreak of MERS larger than the South Korean 2015 outbreak ( i . e . , > 186 cases ) is only of the order of 1 % . Super - spreading events tied to nosocomial outbreaks of MERS and SARS have been attributed in part to diagnos - tic delays , which increase the window of opportunity for generation of secondary cases in settings with suboptimal infection control measures [ 14 , 16 , 36 , 37 ] . Accordingly , the index patient of the MERS outbreak in South Korea was diagnosed 9 days after the onset of symptoms , and Fig . 1 Transmission trees of Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS ) and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) outbreaks linked to health - care settings . a MERS outbreak in Al - Hasa , Saudi Arabia , from 1 April to 23 May 2013 [ 11 ] . b MERS outbreak in South Korea from 20 May to 5 July 2015 [ 13 , 33 ] . c Nosocomial SARS outbreak in Singapore from 25 February to 11 May 2003 [ 16 ] . d Nosocomial SARS outbreak in Toronto from 23 February to 5 April 2003 [ 17 ] . Numbers inside the nodes of the tree are used to indicate a group of cases rather than a single case . Colors are used to distinguish the index case from secondary cases and highlight different exposure categories among secondary cases , including patient , visitor or family member , healthcare worker , and non - clinical staff working in the hospital Chowell et al . BMC Medicine ( 2015 ) 13 : 210 Page 6 of 12 generated an estimated 30 secondary cases [ 14 ] . Similarly , for the nosocomial SARS outbreak in Singapore , the index patient infected 22 secondary individuals and was isolated 5 days after admission to the hospital [ 38 ] . Furthermore , for a nosocomial SARS outbreak in Taiwan , the index case was diagnosed with SARS and admitted to the hospital 6 days after the onset of symptoms , infecting 137 second - ary SARS cases including 45 healthcare workers [ 37 ] . Super - spreading events are the hallmark of a highly hetero - geneous transmission pathway and are potentially mediated by individual variation in infectivity ( through viral shed - ding ) or in the number of contacts [ 23 ] . These characteris - tics are shared by several directly transmitted infectious diseases ; comparison of the transmission heterogeneity par - ameter k suggests that nosocomial transmission of MERS could be more prone to super - spreading events than SARS , Generation Number 0 1 2 3 4 C a s e s pe r gene r a t i on 0 20 40 60 80 100 MERS - South Korea Health - care worker PatientVisitor or Family Non - clinical staff Generation Number 0 1 2 3 4 C a s e s pe r gene r a t i on 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 MERS - Al - Hasa Health - care worker PatientVisitor or Family Non - clinical staff Generation Number 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 C a s e s pe r gene r a t i on 0 5 10 15 20 25 SARS - Singapore Health - care worker PatientVisitor or Family Non - clinical staff Generation Number 0 1 2 3 4 5 C a s e s pe r gene r a t i on 0 5 10 15 20 SARS - Toronto Health - care worker PatientVisitor or Family Non - clinical staff Fig . 2 Total number of cases per disease generation and categorized according to exposure category ( health - care worker , patient , visitor or family member , and non - clinical healthcare staff ) for large nosocomial outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS ) and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) .

Additional data on nosocomial MERS out - breaks would be needed , however , to confirm these find - ings , especially because heterogeneity may differ between outbreaks and countries , and decrease after interventions are put in place [ 23 ] . The reproduction number for secondary cases during transmission chains of MERS in the Middle East has been estimated to lie below the epidemic threshold at R = 1 [ 1 , 5 , 6 ] , whereas past outbreaks of SARS have been char - acterized by an overall reproduction number between 2 and 3 before interventions were implemented [ 41 , 42 ] . Based on the distribution of secondary cases in the Al - Hasa and South Korean outbreaks , we cannot rule out that the reproduction number of MERS is above 1 in the healthcare setting , although our confidence intervals are large . Our estimates , however , are substantially lower than estimates based on more recent nosocomial outbreak data from Saudi Arabia [ 43 ] . Moreover , a recent analysis of MERS cluster sizes reported up to 8 August 2013 [ 25 ] es - timated a subcritical R at 0 . 6 and less heterogeneity than our study ( k = 0 . 24 ) , perhaps owing to the choice of a different time period , or reliance on cluster size data ra - ther than the distribution of secondary cases during hos - pital outbreaks as in our study . As a result , the expected probability of large outbreaks is smaller in [ 25 ] than in our study ( 0 . 01 % for an outbreak larger than the realized South Korean one , versus ~ 1 % in our study ) . Similar find - ings were obtained by another study that analyzed the outcomes of 36 historical MERS importation events , in - cluding the recent South Korean outbreak , in terms of outbreak size and total number of disease generations ( R = 0 . 75 and k = 0 . 14 ) [ 26 ] . Differences between studies are in part driven by methodology , because reproduction number estimates could be inflated in studies that do not account for transmission heterogeneity . Further , each study focused on a different subset and time period of the MERS epi - demic , and to our knowledge our study is the first to dis - sect transmission dynamics in the hospital setting . Of note , our approach did not explicitly integrate the effect of in - creased case detection , contact tracing , and infection con - trol interventions , which likely helped stamp out the MERS and SARS outbreaks after a few disease generations . Overall , while transmission of MERS ( and SARS ) appears critical in the hospital setting before active case detection and interventions are in place , it is thought that the trans - mission potential of these coronaviruses remains subcrit - ical in the community [ 6 ] . The ongoing South Korean cluster appears to be large in terms of initial super - spreading events , and we cannot rule out a different transmission potential of MERS in South Korea owing to particular climatological condi - tions , characteristics of the hospital system , and cultural Generation Number 0 1 2 3 4 R ep r odu c t i on nu m be r pe r gene r a t i on 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 MERS - South Korea Overall reproduction number Health - care worker PatientVisitor or Family Non - clinical staff Generation Number 0 1 2 3 4 R ep r odu c t i on nu m be r pe r gene r a t i on 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 3 MERS - Al - Hasa Overall reproduction number Health - care worker PatientVisitor or Family Non - clinical staff Generation Number 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 R ep r odu c t i on nu m be r pe r gene r a t i on 0 5 10 15 20 25 SARS - Singapore Overall reproduction number Health - care worker PatientVisitor or Family Non - clinical staff Generation Number 0 1 2 3 4 5 R ep r odu c t i on nu m be r pe r gene r a t i on 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 SARS - Toronto Overall reproduction number Health - care worker PatientVisitor or Family Non - clinical staff Fig . 4 The reproduction number according to disease generations , R g , starting with the index reproduction number ( R 0 ) at generation 0 and according to exposure category ( healthcare worker , patients , visitors or family member , and non - clinical staff ) for Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS ) and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) outbreaks linked to healthcare settings .

BMC Medicine ( 2015 ) 13 : 210 Page 8 of 12 factors , including the tendency of family members and visitors to be involved in the nursing work of hospital - ized relatives [ 44 ] . Interestingly , we found that the rela - tive exposure patterns differed between SARS and MERS , with a higher frequency of healthcare workers for SARS , and a predominance of patients visiting the same hospital as the index case for MERS . For both pathogens , family members came second in terms of risk category . These differences would be worth investigating further because they could signal an improvement in Generation 0 50 100 C u m u l a t i v e nu m be r o f c a s e s 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 Generation 0 50 100 N e w c a s e s 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 MERS Outbreak size 10 2 F r equen cy ( % ) 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 Outbreak duration 10 0 10 2 F r equen cy ( % ) 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 Peak size10 2 F r equen cy ( % ) 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 Generation 0 50 100 C u m u l a t i v e nu m be r o f c a s e s 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 Generation 0 50 100 N e w c a s e s 0 50 100 150 SARS Outbreak size 10 2 F r equen c y ( % ) 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 Outbreak duration 10 0 10 2 F r equen c y ( % ) 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 Peak size10 2 F r equen c y ( % ) 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 Fig . 5 Outbreaksimulationsfor ( top ) MiddleEasternrespiratorysyndrome ( MERS ) and ( bottom ) severeacuterespiratorysyndrome ( SARS ) throughbranching processmodelsusingparametersshowninTable3 .

Data points for observed MERS and SARS outbreaks are shown in color for reference Chowell et al . BMC Medicine ( 2015 ) 13 : 210 Page 9 of 12 healthcare worker precautions since the SARS outbreak in 2003 , different patient care habits in South Korea characterized by higher involvement of family members , or slightly different routes of transmission for these two coronaviruses . Our findings derived from the comparative analysis of nosocomial outbreaks of MERS and SARS indirectly sup - port the need for rapid case detection , enhanced and sus - tained infection control measures , and effective isolation and quarantine strategies in order to prevent or promptly control potential MERS and SARS outbreaks , which is in line with past modeling studies of the transmission dy - namics of SARS in 2003 [ 41 , 42 , 45 – 48 ] . These measures include droplet precautions , e . g . , wearing surgical masks , and contact precautions , e . g . , wearing gown and gloves in the patients ’ room [ 49 ] . In addition , the super - spreader events that are key to amplify nosocomial transmission of MERS and SARS outbreaks [ 23 ] support the adoption of airborne precautions that include at least six hourly air changes in treatment rooms [ 50 ] . A thorough investiga - tion of the transmission pathways from a single index case to 30 secondary cases in healthcare settings in South Korea is needed . Our study is not exempt of limitations . First , our data from South Korea may be prone to right censoring , as fur - ther transmission events stemming from individuals under quarantine or currently hospitalized individuals cannot be ruled out in the near future . However , the outbreak ap - pears to be on an imminent path to extinction given that no new cases have been reported in South Korea since 4 July 2015 . Second , we were not able to characterize risk of infection according to exposure category in absolute terms ( e . g . , healthcare workers , patients , visitors ) because rele - vant denominator data were not available for secondary cases . For this reason , we focused our analysis on relative comparisons of exposure categories between individual outbreaks , disease generations , and virus types . Third , we focused on outbreaks with detailed transmission trees , and thus , contact - tracing activities must have been effect - ively carried out during those outbreaks , which may in turn have affected subsequent exposure and transmission patterns . Overall , most methods used to quantify trans - mission potential and transmission heterogeneity are prone to reporting biases , especially because larger clus - ters and more severely ill patients tend to be overly repre - sented in any surveillance dataset [ 1 , 6 , 24 ] . However , large hospital outbreaks that persist for several generations are worth studying because they offer a useful window on the distribution of secondary cases , for a particularly im - portant subset of the epidemic . Conclusion We have carried out a first head - to - head comparison of exposure and transmission patterns for large hospital clusters of MERS and SARS , including the most recent May – July 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea . Our findings confirm the importance of super - spreading events in the healthcare setting for the transmission dy - namics of both coronaviruses , an effect that may be even more pronounced for MERS than SARS . As a result , large outbreaks of MERS , although rare , can happen and can generate very sharp incidence peaks that may be dif - ficult to control . Differences in the relative exposure of the two viruses could signal changes in hospital health - care practices over time and / or different mechanisms of transmission , which would be worth investigating fur - ther . Our data are consistent with the benefits of rapid case detection and strict adherence to infection control measures , which can rapidly reduce the risk of super - spreading events and therefore the size of the nosoco - mial outbreaks [ 10 , 11 , 16 , 17 ] . More broadly , our study emphasizes the importance of individual patient data and transmission tree information to dissect the progres - sion of subcritical outbreaks of key interest . Overall , the South Korean experience with MERS underscores the po - tential risk of importation of emerging infectious diseases into other regions of the world and the need to better understand the cross - species transmission mechanisms of MERS in the Arabian Peninsula [ 20 ] . The South Korean MERS outbreak is a wake - up call emphasizing the need for flexible epidemiological surveillance systems and strong public health infrastructure to quickly detect and stamp out potential outbreaks , including in countries with no prior MERS experience .
