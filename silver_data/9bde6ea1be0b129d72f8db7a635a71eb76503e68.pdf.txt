INTRODUCTION Attaining equality of opportunity is a fundamental value in democratic societies , therefore existing inequalities present us with a major concern . A particularly sore example is that many highly - qualiﬁed women and members of minority groups are unable to realize their full potential in society ( and speciﬁcally in the workforce ) due to a phenomenon commonly referred to as the glass ceiling , a powerful visual image for an invisible barrier blocking women and minorities from advancing past middle management levels [ 20 ] . This concern was raised in a recent US Federal commission report [ 18 ] : The “glass ceiling” . . . is the unseen , yet unbreak - able barrier that keeps minorities and women from rising to the upper rungs of the corporate ladder , regardless of their qualiﬁcations or achievements . The existence of the glass ceiling eﬀect is well documented [ 8 , 16 , 30 ] . In academia , for example , gender disparities have been observed in the number of professors [ 34 ] , earn - ings [ 13 , 34 , 40 ] funding [ 29 ] and patents [ 10 ] . A recent study [ 26 ] analyzed gender diﬀerences in research output , re - search impact and collaborations based on Thomson Reuters Web of Science databases . When prominent author posi - tions were analyzed by sole authorship , ﬁrst - authorship and last - authorship , it was discovered that papers with women in those leading roles were less frequently cited . The ques - tion we focus on in this article concerns the causes of this phenomenon . What are the invisible mechanisms that com - bine to create the glass ceiling eﬀect , and in particular , what is the role of the social network in creating this eﬀect ? Many papers discuss possible causes of the glass ceiling eﬀect and potential solutions to it , e . g . , [ 9 , 15 , 24 ] , but to the best of our knowledge , the present work is the ﬁrst attempt to study it in the context of the social network structure and to propose a mathematical model capturing this phenomenon . The paper’s main contributions are the following . ( 1 ) We propose a model for bi - populated social networks extending the classical preferential attachment model [ 2 ] , and augment it by including two additional basic phenomena , namely , a minority - majority partition , and homophily . ( 2 ) We propose a formal deﬁnition for the glass ceiling eﬀect in social net - works . ( 3 ) We rigorously analyze this extended model and establish its suitability as a possible mechanism for the emer - gence of a glass ceiling eﬀect . We also show that omitting any one of the three ingredients of our model prevents the occurrence of a glass ceiling eﬀect . ( 4 ) We present empirical evidence for a network exhibiting preferential attachment , minority - majority partition , homophily , and a glass ceiling eﬀect . In order to talk about the glass ceiling eﬀect we have to agree on a measure of success in a social network . Following the traditional approach that sees network edges as the “so - cial capital” of the network , we deﬁne successful members of a social network to be high degree vertices , namely , vertices that maintain a large number of connections , correspond - ing to high inﬂuence . We base our model on a bi - populated network augmented by three well - accepted observations on human behavior , namely ( i ) the“rich get richer”mechanism , ( ii ) minority - majority partition ( with a slower growth rate of the minority group in the network ) , and ( iii ) homophily ( aﬃnity towards those similar to oneself ) . The main result of the paper is that under these three simple and standard assumptions the glass ceiling eﬀect naturally arises in so - cial networks . Let us ﬁrst brieﬂy describe these three social phenomena . The “rich get richer” mechanism . This mechanism describes and explains the process of wealth concentration . It follows the basic idea that newly created wealth is dis - tributed among members of society in proportion to the amount they have already amassed . In our setting , where the degree of the vertex captures its level of social wealth , this mechanism predicts that people may try to connect more often to people who already have many connections , either in order to proﬁt from their social wealth or because they are more visible in the network . Minority - majority partition . Many social groups ex - hibit unequal proportions of men and women . Certain oc - cupations , such as construction , law enforcement , politics and computer science , tend to have a higher proportion of men . For example , the ratio of women taking up studies in the computing discipline varies per year and region between 10 % and 35 % [ 3 , 21 , 38 , 44 ] . Other professions , such as elementary school teaching , nursing , and oﬃce administra - tion , are occupied by a higher proportion of women . In fact , it is diﬃcult to ﬁnd an occupation with a balanced ratio of genders ( this also holds for many other social partitions , e . g . , ones based on ethnicity or family background ) . This imbalance is the second phenomenon underlying our model . Homophily . It is a well established social phenomenon that people tend to associate with others who are similar to themselves . Characteristics such as gender , ethnicity , age , class background and education inﬂuence the relationships among human beings [ 27 ] and similarities make communi - cation and relationship formation easier . In summary , our model is obtained by applying the classi - cal preferential attachment model ( see Barabasi and Albert [ 2 ] ) to a bi - populated minority - majority network augmented with homophily . The resulting model is hereafter referred to as the Biased Preferential Attachment Model . Roadmap . The rest of the paper is organized as follows . In the next section we review related work , then in Sec - tion 3 we introduce the model and the formal deﬁnitions of the involved properties : glass ceiling , power inequality and homophily tests . In Section 4 we state our two main theo - rems , and in Section 5 we provide empirical evidence for the existence of all our necessary ingredients and for the glass ceiling eﬀect in a student - mentor network of researchers in computer science . We conclude with a discussion . 2 . RELATED WORK Homophily in social networks . Diﬀerent characteris - tics , such as gender , ethnicities , age , class background and education , inﬂuence the relationships human beings form with each other [ 27 ] . McPherson et al . [ 32 ] survey a vari - ety of properties and how they lead to particular patterns in bonding . Gender - based homophily can already be ob - served in play patterns among children at school [ 31 , 41 ] . Eder and Hallinan [ 12 ] discovered that young girls are more likely to resolve intransitivity by deleting friendship choices , while young boys are more likely to add them . Overall , children are signiﬁcantly more likely to resolve intransitivity by deleting a cross - sex friendship than by adding another cross - sex friendship [ 45 ] . These results show that gender in - ﬂuences the formation of cliques and larger evolving network structures . These trends , displaying homophily and gender diﬀerences in resolving problems in the structure of relation - ships , mean that boys and girls gravitate towards diﬀerent social circles . As adults , homophilic behavior persists , and men still tend to have networks that are more homophilic than women do . This behavior is even more pronounced in areas where they form the majority and in relationships ex - changing advice and based on respect , e . g . , mentoring [ 5 , 22 , 23 , 39 ] . A homophilic network evolution model was studied in [ 4 ] . In this model new nodes connect to other nodes in two phases . First , they choose their neighbors with a bias towards their own type ( the model allows a positive as well as a negative bias ) . In a second phase they make an unbi - ased choice of neighbors from among the neighbors of their biased neighbors . The authors show that the second phase overcomes the bias in the ﬁrst phase and if the second phase is unbiased , then the network ends up in an integrated state . They illustrate their model with data on citations in physics journals . Gender disparity in science and technology . Gen - der disparities have been observed in the number of profes - sors [ 13 , 34 ] , earnings [ 40 ] , funding [ 29 ] and patenting [ 10 ] . A related aspect is the “productivity puzzle” : men are more successful when it comes to number of publications and name position in the author list [ 46 ] , for reasons yet un - clear . Some conjectures raised involve ( unknown ) biased perceptions related to pregnancy / child care [ 6 ] . E . g . , it was observed in [ 34 ] that science faculty members of both sexes exhibit unconscious biases against women . Gender diﬀer - ences in research output , research impact and collabora - tions was analyzed in a study based on Thomson Reuters Web of Science databases [ 26 ] . It was not only revealed that papers with women in prominent author positions ( sole authorship , ﬁrst - authorship and last - authorship ) were cited less frequently but the authors also found that age plays an important role in collaborations , authorship position and ci - tations . Thus many of the trends observed therein might be explained by the under - representation of women among the elders of science . In other words , ﬁxing the“leaky pipeline” [ 43 ] is key for a more equal gender distribution in science . Minority of women in Computer Science . In the computing discipline , the ratio of women taking up stud - ies varies by year and region between 10 % and 35 % [ 3 , 21 , 38 , 44 ] ( except in Malaysia , where women form a nar - row majority [ 35 ] ) . This under - representation has been in - vestigated [ 19 , 42 , 47 ] and remedial strategies have been propoesd [ 17 , 37 ] . There is a positive feedback loop [ 25 ] : the lack of women leads to a strong male stereotype which minority & homophily : no minority : no homophily : absolute homophily : r = 0 . 3 , ρ = 0 . 7 r = 0 . 5 , ρ = 0 . 7 r = 0 . 3 , ρ = 1 r = 0 . 3 , ρ = 0 ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) Figure 1 : Examples of the Biased Preferential Attachment ( BPA ) model with various parameter settings . All examples depict a 300 - vertex bi - populated network generated by our BPA model starting from a single edge connecting a blue and a red vertex ( with vertex size proportional to its degree ) . drives away even more women . It’s been explained that the increase of the relative number of women in computer science was the best of the investigated remedial strategies , up to a “critical mass” of women . However , as pointed out by Et - zkowitz [ 14 ] , even achieving a representation of 15 % women might not guarantee that the eﬀects of a critical mass come into play . 3 . MODEL AND DEFINITIONS 3 . 1 Biased preferential attachment model Our ﬁrst contribution is in proposing a simple bi - populated preferential attachment model . In a gist , our model is ob - tained by applying the classical preferential attachment model [ 2 ] to a bi - populated minority - majority network augmented with homophily . The resulting model is hereafter referred to as the Biased Preferential Attachment Model . Formally , for r ≤ 1 / 2 and 0 ≤ ρ ≤ 1 let G ( n , r , ρ ) be a variant of the preferential attachment model in which the vertices are red or blue , n is the total number of nodes , and r represents the relative arrival rate of the red vertices ( and hence the expected fraction of red vertices in the network converges to r as well , as the relative size of the initial population be - comes smaller over time ) , and ρ represents the level to which homophily ( incorporated by using rejection sampling ) is ex - pressed in the system : for ρ = 1 the system is uniform and exhibits no homophily , whereas for ρ = 0 the system is fully segregated , and all added edges connect vertex pairs of the same color . Let us describe the model in more detail . Denote the so - cial network at time t by G t = ( V t , E t ) , where V t and E t , respectively , are the sets of vertices and edges in the network at time t , and let δ t ( v ) denote the degree of vertex v at time t ( we may omit the parameter t when it is clear from the context ) . The process starts with an arbitrary initial ( con - nected ) network G 0 in which each vertex has an arbitrary color , red or blue . ( For simplicity we require that a minimal initial network consists of one blue and one red vertex con - nected by an edge , but this requirement can be removed if ρ > 0 ) . This initial network evolves in time as follows . In every time step t a new vertex v enters the network . This vertex is red with probability r and blue with probability 1 − r . On arrival , the vertex v chooses an existing vertex u ∈ V t to attach to according to preferential attachment , i . e . , with probability p proportional to u ’s degree at time t , i . e . , P [ u is chosen ] = δ t ( u ) / (cid:80) w ∈ V t δ t ( w ) . Next , if u ’s color is the same as v ’s color , then an edge is inserted between v and u ; if the colors diﬀer , then the edge is inserted with probability ρ , and with probability 1 − ρ the selection is rejected , and the process of choosing a neighbor for v is restarted . This process is repeated until some edge { v , u } has been inserted . Thus in each time step , one new vertex and one new edge are added to the existing graph . Figure 1 presents four examples of parameter settings for our model on a 300 - vertex bi - populated social network . First , Figure 1 ( a ) provides an example for the minority & ho - mophily case with r = 0 . 3 and ρ = 0 . 7 so the red vertices are a strict minority in the network and there is some ho - mophily in the edge selection . The next three sub - ﬁgures present special cases . Figure 1 ( b ) illustrates the no minority case ( equal - size populations , i . e . , r = 0 . 5 ) with homophily ( ρ = 0 . 7 ) . Figure 1 ( c ) considers the no homophily case ( ρ = 1 ) with minority ( r = 0 . 3 ) . The last extreme case , shown in Figure 1 ( d ) , is absolute homophily , where ρ = 0 , but the red vertices are still in the minority ( r = 0 . 3 ) . This case results in fully segregated societies , namely , societies where members connect only to members of their own color . In this extreme case , the society in eﬀect splits into two sep - arate networks , one for each of the two populations ( except for the single edge connecting the initial red and blue ver - tices ) . Consider as an example for our model the social network of mentor - student relationships in academia . With time , new PhD students arrive , but for some ﬁelds female students ar - rive at a lower rate than male students . Upon arrival , each student needs to select exactly one mentor , where the selec - tion process is governed by the mechanisms of preferential attachment and homophily . Namely , initially the student selects the mentor according to the rules of preferential at - tachment and then homophily takes its role , rejecting the selection with some probability if their gender is diﬀerent and forcing a re - selection . Over time , graduated students may become mentors and some mentors become more suc - cessful than others ( in terms of the number of students they advise ) . A glass ceiling eﬀect can be observed in this net - work if , after a long enough time interval , the fraction of females among the most successful mentors tends to zero . We would like to emphasize that the homophily eﬀect that we look at is quite minor and “seemingly harmless” , in two ways . First , it is “symmetric” , i . e . , it applies both to male students with respect to female mentors and to female stu - dents with respect to male mentors . Second , it does not adversely aﬀect the student , in the sense that the student always gets admitted in our model . The only tiny ( but omi - nous ) sign for the potential dangers of this homophilic ef - fect is that it does aﬀect the professor : a male professor who rejects ( or is rejected by ) some fraction of the female candidates risks little , whereas a female professor who re - jects ( or is rejected by ) some fraction of the male candidates will eventually have fewer students overall , since most of the applicants are male . In fact , as we show later on , this homophily - based consequence will only impact her if her fu - ture potential students use preferential attachment to select their mentors . 3 . 2 Power inequality and glass ceiling Our second contribution is to propose formal deﬁnitions of the glass ceiling eﬀect in social networks . Consider a bi - populated network G ( n ) consisting of m edges and n nodes of two types , the groups R and B of red and blue nodes . We assume that the network size n tends to inﬁnity with time . Let n ( R ) and n ( B ) denote the number of red and blue nodes , respectively , where n ( R ) + n ( B ) = n . The red nodes are assumed to be a minority in the social network , i . e . , denoting the percentage of red nodes in the network by r , we assume 0 ≤ r < 12 . Let d ( R ) and d ( B ) denote the sum of degrees of the red and blue nodes , respectively , where d ( R ) + d ( B ) = 2 m . Let top k ( R ) ( respectively , top k ( B ) ) denote the number of red ( resp . , blue ) nodes that have degree at least k in G . When G ( n ) is a random graph , we replace variables by their expectations in the deﬁnitions below , e . g . , we use E [ n ( R ) ] , E [ d ( R ) ] , and E [ top k ( R ) ] . Next we provide formal deﬁnitions for the social phenomena discussed in the introduction . Power inequality for the minority is deﬁned in the following way . Definition 1 ( Power inequality ) . A graph sequence G ( n ) exhibits a power inequality eﬀect for the red nodes if the average power of a red node is lower than that of a blue ( or a random ) node , i . e . , there exists a constant c < 1 such that lim n →∞ 1 n ( R ) (cid:80) v ∈ R δ ( v ) 1 n ( B ) (cid:80) v ∈ B δ ( v ) = d ( R ) / n ( R ) d ( B ) / n ( B ) ≤ c . ( 1 ) The deﬁnition of the glass ceiling eﬀect is more complex . We interpret the most powerful positions as those held by the highest degree nodes , and oﬀer two alternative deﬁni - tions . The ﬁrst tries to capture the informal , “dictionary” deﬁnition , which describes a decreasing fraction of women among higher degree nodes , i . e . , in the tail of the graph degree sequence . Formally : Definition 2 ( Tail glass ceiling ) . A graph sequence G ( n ) exhibits a tail glass ceiling eﬀect for the red nodes if there exists an increasing function k ( n ) ( for short k ) such that lim n →∞ top k ( B ) = ∞ and lim n →∞ top k ( R ) top k ( B ) = 0 . a b c d e f g j h i b a c e d j 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 f g i h 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ( a ) ( b ) Figure 2 : ( a ) An example bi - populated social net - work with blue and red populations of 6 and 4 ver - tices respectively . ( b ) The degree sequences of both populations ( i . e . , the sequence specifying for each vertex its degree in the network ) . Considering the tail glass ceiling deﬁnition , there are four blue ver - tices of degree greater or equal to 4 , but only two such red vertices so top 4 ( R ) / top 4 ( B ) = 1 / 2 . For the moment glass ceiling deﬁnition , the second moment for the blue vertices is 16 ( 8 2 + 7 2 + 5 2 + 4 2 + 3 2 + 3 2 ) = 28 . 6 , while for the red vertices it is 14 ( 7 2 + 5 2 + 3 2 + 3 2 ) = 23 and the ratio is 23 / 28 . 6 . To exhibit a glass ceil - ing , these ratios should converge to zero as the net - work size increases . Regarding homophily , in a ran - dom network with the same population , i . e . , 60 % blue vertices and 40 % red vertices , one expects to ﬁnd 36 % blue - blue edges , 16 % red - red edges and 48 % mixed edge . If we take the degree sequences into ac - count we would expect to see 46 . 8 % mixed edge . In the above example network we observe only about 33 % mixed edges , which indicates the eﬀect of ho - mophily . The second deﬁnition considers a more traditional , distribution - oriented measure , the second moment of the two degree se - quences . Formally : Definition 3 ( Moment glass ceiling ) . A graph se - quence G ( n ) exhibits a moment glass ceiling g for the red nodes where g = lim n →∞ 1 n ( R ) (cid:80) v ∈ R δ ( v ) 2 1 n ( B ) (cid:80) v ∈ B δ ( v ) 2 . When g = 0 , we say that G ( n ) has a strong glass ceiling ef - fect . The intuition behind this deﬁnition is that a larger sec - ond moment ( and assuming a similar average degree , i . e . , no power inequality ) will result in a larger variance and there - fore a signiﬁcantly larger number of high degree nodes . As we show in the full version of the paper , the above two def - initions for the glass ceiling are independent , in the sense that neither of the eﬀects implies the other . Testing for homophily in a bi - populated network is based on checking whether the number of mixed ( i . e . , red - blue ) edges is signiﬁcantly lower than to be expected if neighbors were to be picked randomly and independently of their color . Formally : Definition 4 ( Homophily Test ) . [ 11 ] A bi - populated social network exhibits homophily if the fraction of mixed edges is signiﬁcantly less than 2 r ( 1 − r ) . The above deﬁnition implicitly assumes that there is power equality between the colors and therefore is not always ac - curate . A more careful test should take the average degree of each gender into account . Definition 5 ( Normalized Homophily Test ) . A bi - populated social network exhibits homophily if the fraction of mixed edges is signiﬁcantly less than 2 d ( R ) 2 m (cid:16) 1 − d ( R ) 2 m (cid:17) . An illustration of these deﬁnitions can be found in Figure 2 . 4 . THEORETICAL RESULTS 4 . 1 Power inequality and glass ceiling Our main theoretical result ( Thm . 4 . 1 ) is that in the biased preferential attachment model , G ( n , r , ρ ) , the glass ceiling eﬀect emerges naturally . Additionally , this process generates a power inequality , an independent property that is weaker than the glass ceiling eﬀect . Power inequality de - scribes the situation where the average degree of the minor - ity is lower than that of the majority ( although their mem - bers possess the same qualiﬁcations ) . Moreover , we also show ( Thm . 4 . 2 ) that all three ingredients ( unequal entry rate , homophily , preferential attachment ) are necessary to generate what we call a strong glass ceiling eﬀect , i . e . , re - moving any one of them will prevent the appearance of a glass ceiling eﬀect . One may suspect that the glass ceiling eﬀect is in fact a byproduct of power inequality or unequal qualiﬁcations ; we show in the full paper that this is not the case . Minorities can have a smaller average degree without suﬀering from a glass ceiling eﬀect . We also note that our results are independent of the starting condition . Even if the network initially consisted entirely of vertices of one color , if a majority of the vertices being added are of the opposite color , then eventually the vertices that rise to the highest positions will be of the new color . Theorem 4 . 1 . Let 0 < r < 12 and 0 < ρ < 1 . For G ( n , r , ρ ) produced by the Biased Preferential Attachment Model the following holds : 1 . G ( n , r , ρ ) exhibits power inequality , and 2 . G ( n , r , ρ ) exhibits both a tail and a strong glass ceiling eﬀects . Moreover , all three ingredients are necessary to generate a strong glass ceiling eﬀect . Theorem 4 . 2 . 1 . G ( n , r , ρ ) will not exhibit a glass ceil - ing eﬀect in the following cases : ( a ) If the rate r = 12 ( no minority ) . ( b ) If ρ = 1 ( no homophily ) ( c ) If ρ = 0 ( no heterophily ) . 2 . G ( n , r , ρ ) will not exhibit a strong glass ceiling eﬀect if attachment is uniform rather than preferential , i . e . , a new vertex at time t selects an existing vertex to attach to uniformly at random from all vertices present at time t − 1 ( and for any value of r and ρ ) . Let us graphically illustrate the above results . Figure 3 presents the degree distributions of both the red and blue populations ( as well as of the entire population ) for four 1 , 000 , 000 - vertex networks with parameters identical to the examples in Figure 1 . The plots clearly show ( and we prove this formally ) that in all cases the degree distribution of both populations follows a power - law . ( A subset W of vertices in a given network obeys a power - law degree distribution if the fraction P ( k ) of vertices of degree k in W behaves for large values of k as P ( k ) ∼ k − β for parameter β . ) All ﬁgures present ( in log - log scale ) the cumulative degree dis - tributions , so a power - law corresponds to a straight line ( we present the samples together with the best - ﬁt line ) . The - orem 4 . 1 corresponds to Figure 3 ( a ) with the minority & homophily settings of 0 < r < 12 and 0 < ρ < 1 . In this case ( and only in this case ) , the power - law exponents of the red and blue populations , β ( R ) and β ( B ) respectively , are diﬀerent , where β ( R ) > β ( B ) ; we prove that this will eventu - ally lead to both tail and strong glass ceiling eﬀect for the red vertices . Theorem 4 . 2 corresponds to Figures 3 ( b ) and 3 ( c ) . The ﬁgures show that in the case of no minority ( i . e . , r = 0 . 5 ) or no homophily ( i . e . , ρ = 1 ) , both β ( R ) and β ( B ) are the same ( in particular they are equal to 3 as in the clas - sical Preferential Attachment model ) , and therefore there will be no glass ceiling eﬀect . Figure 3 ( d ) considers the last extreme case of absolute homophily . Perhaps surprisingly , in this case a glass ceiling eﬀect also does not occur , as each sub - population forms an absolute majority in its own net - work ( see again Figure 1 ( d ) ) . The case of no preferential attachment ( which does not lead to a glass ceiling ) is more delicate and presented in the full version of the paper . Proof Overview of Theorem 4 . 1 . The basic idea be - hind the proof of Theorem 4 . 1 is to show that both pop - ulations in G ( n , r , ρ ) have a power law degree distribution but with diﬀerent exponents . Once this is established , it is simple to derive the glass ceiling eﬀect for the popula - tion with a higher exponent in the degree distribution . To study the degree distribution of the red ( and similarly the blue ) population , we ﬁrst deﬁne α t to be the random vari - able that is equal to the ratio of the total degree of the red nodes ( i . e . , the sum of degrees of all red nodes ) divided by the total degree ( i . e . , twice the number of edges ) . We show that the expected value of α t converges to a ﬁxed ratio in - dependently of how the network started . The proof of this part is based on tools from dynamic systems . Basically , we show that there is only one ﬁxed point for our system . How - ever , determining the expectation of α t is not suﬃcient for analyzing the degree distribution , and it is also necessary to bound the rate of convergence and the concentration of α t around its expectation . We used Doob martingales for this part . Using the high concentration of the total degree , we were able to adapt standard techniques to prove the power law degree distribution . Next we give an overview of the proofs and the helping lemmas , but due to space limitations we defer the details to the full version of this paper . 4 . 2 Proof sketch of Theorem 4 . 1 Part 1 An urn process . The biased preferential attachment model G ( n , r , ρ ) process can also be interpreted as a Polya’s urn process , where each edge in the graph corresponds to two balls , one for each endpoint , and the balls are colored by the color of the corresponding vertices . When a new ( red or blue ) ball y arrives , we choose an existing ball c from the urn uniformly at random ; if c is of the same color as y , then we add to the urn both y and another ball of the same Both Female Male (cid:45)Β(cid:61)(cid:45) 2 . 9 (cid:45)Β (cid:72) R (cid:76) (cid:61)(cid:45) 3 . 07 (cid:45)Β (cid:72) B (cid:76) (cid:61)(cid:45) 2 . 86 1 5 10 50 100 500 1000 10 (cid:45) 6 10 (cid:45) 5 10 (cid:45) 4 0 . 001 0 . 01 0 . 1 1 Degree P r ob a b ilt y Both Female Male (cid:45)Β(cid:61)(cid:45) 3 .

Each ﬁgure presents the degree distribution ( on a log - log scale ) of the red and blue populations from a 1 , 000 , 000 - vertex network generated by the BPA model with the same parameters as the corresponding ﬁgure in Figure 1 . In all cases both populations exhibit a power - law degree distribution but only in case ( a ) they with diﬀerent exponents . color as c ; otherwise ( i . e . , if c is of a diﬀerent color ) , with probability ρ we still add to the urn both y and another ball of the same color as c , and with probability 1 − ρ we reject the choice of c and repeat choosing an existing ball c (cid:48) from the urn uniformly at random . To analyze power inequality , there is no need to keep track of the degrees of individual vertices ; the sum of the degrees of all vertices of R is exactly the number of red balls in the urn . Denote by d t ( R ) ( respectively , d t ( B ) ) the number of red ( resp . , blue ) balls present in the system at time t ≥ 0 . Altogether , the number of balls at time t is d t = d t ( R ) + d t ( B ) . Initially , the system contains d o balls . Noting that exactly two balls join the system in each time step , we have d t = d o + 2 t . Note that while d t ( R ) and d t ( B ) are random variables , d t is not . Recall that balls represent degrees so d t = (cid:80) w ∈ V t δ t ( w ) . Denote by α t the random variable equal to d t ( R ) / d t , the fraction of red balls in the system at time t . Convergence of expectations . We ﬁrst claim that the process of biased preferential attachment converges to a ratio of α red balls in the system . More formally , we claim that regardless of the starting condition , there exists a limit α = lim t →∞ E [ α t ] . Lemma 4 . 3 . E [ α t + 1 | α t ] = α t + F ( α t ) − α t t + 1 , where F ( x ) = (cid:18) 1 − ( 1 − r ) ( 1 − x ) 1 − x ( 1 − ρ ) + r x 1 − ( 1 − x ) ( 1 − ρ ) (cid:19) / 2 . Lemma 4 . 4 . 1 . F is monotonically increasing . 2 . F has exactly one ﬁxed point , denoted α ∗ , in [ 0 , 1 ] . 3 . The image of the unit interval by F is contained in the unit interval : F ( [ 0 , 1 ] ) = (cid:2) r 2 , 1 + r 2 (cid:3) ⊂ [ 0 , 1 ] 4 . If x < α ∗ then x < F ( x ) < α ∗ and if x > α ∗ then x > F ( x ) > α ∗ . 5 . α ∗ < r . Now assume α t < α ∗ . By Lemma 4 . 4 , α t < F ( α t ) < α ∗ , so by Lemma 4 . 3 we obtain α t < E [ α t + 1 | α t ] < α ∗ . Moreover we can bound the rate of convergence and show : Lemma 4 . 5 . | α ∗ − E [ α t ] | = O ( 1 / 3 √ t ) . Theorem 4 . 6 . For any initial conﬁguration , as t goes to inﬁnity , the expected fraction of red balls in the urn , E ( α t ) , converges to the unique α ∗ in [ 0 , 1 ] satisfying the equation 2 α ∗ = 1 − ( 1 − r ) ( 1 − α ∗ ) 1 − α ∗ ( 1 − ρ ) + r α ∗ 1 − ( 1 − α ∗ ) ( 1 − ρ ) . ( 2 ) Hence the limit α ∗ is the solution of the cubic equation Eq . ( 3 ) . ( 4 ρ − 2 ρ 2 − 2 ) α 3 + ( 2 + 3 ρ 2 − 5 ρ + 2 r − 2 rρ ) α 2 ( 3 ) + ( 2 ρ − 2 r + 2 rρ − ρ 2 ) α − rρ = 0 Note that this limit is independent of the initial values d o and α 0 of the system . We know that the expected degree of a random vertex is 2 and since the expected degree of a red vertex tends to 2 α ∗ / r , which is strictly less than 2 ( because of Lemma 4 . 4 Part 5 ) , we can claim : Corollary 4 . 7 . Let 0 < ρ < 1 , 0 < r < 1 / 2 . Then G ( n , r , ρ ) has a power inequality eﬀect . 4 . 3 Proof sketch of Theorem 4 . 1 Part 2 Concentration . To prove the glass ceiling eﬀect we ﬁrst bound the degree distribution . To do this we need to bound the rate by which d t ( R ) converge to α · t . Let X i ∈ { 0 , 1 , 2 } be the number of new red balls in the system at time i . Note that d t ( R ) = (cid:80) t 0 X i . Let Ψ i = E X i + 1 , X i + 2 , . . . , X t (cid:104) t (cid:88) j = 0 X j | X 1 , X 2 , . . . , X i (cid:105) . Observe that ( Ψ i ) i is a Doob Martingale [ 33 ] , and note that Ψ 0 = E (cid:104) (cid:80) ti = 0 X i (cid:105) = E (cid:104) d t ( R ) (cid:105) . Theorem 4 . 8 ( Azuma’s inequality [ 1 ] ) . Let Ψ t be a martingale such that for all i , almost surely | Ψ i − Ψ i − 1 | < c i . Then for all positive t and all positive reals x , Pr ( Ψ t − Ψ 0 ≥ x ) ≤ exp (cid:18) − x 2 2 (cid:80) i c 2 i (cid:19) . Lemma 4 . 9 . Let C i = | Ψ i − Ψ i − 1 | . Then C i = O ( (cid:112) t / i ) . For simplicity of the description , let us assume hereafter that d o = 0 , hence α t = d t ( R ) / ( 2 t ) . By Theorem 4 . 8 and Lemma 4 . 9 we have Lemma 4 . 10 . Pr (cid:104) | d t ( R ) − 2 t E ( α t ) | > O ( 2 √ t log t ) (cid:105) ≤ 1 t 4 . Combining Lemmas 4 . 5 and 4 . 10 yields : Corollary 4 . 11 . Pr (cid:20) | α ∗ − α t | > max (cid:26) 2 log t √ t , 1 3 √ t (cid:27)(cid:21) < 1 t 4 . Degree distribution . We investigate the degree distri - bution of the red and blue vertices in a graph generated by the above described process , following the analysis outline of [ 7 ] for the basic preferential attachment model . Let m k , t ( B ) ( resp . , m k , t ( R ) ) denote the number of blue ( resp . , red ) vertices of degree k at time t . For x ∈ { R , B } , deﬁne M k ( x ) = lim t →∞ E ( m k , t ( x ) ) t . ( 4 ) Theorem 4 . 12 . The expected degree distributions of the blue and red vertices follow a power law , namely , M k ( B ) ∝ k − β ( B ) and M k ( R ) ∝ k − β ( R ) . If 0 < r < 1 / 2 and 0 < ρ < 1 then β ( R ) > 3 > β ( B ) . Equipped with Theorem 4 . 12 , Part 2 of Theorem 4 . 1 fol - lows easily . Indeed , for the tail glass ceiling eﬀect , let k ( n ) = n 1 β ( R ) . Then E [ top k ( R ) ] = n ( R ) (cid:88) k (cid:48) ≥ k M k (cid:48) ( R ) , E [ top k ( B ) ] = n ( B ) (cid:88) k (cid:48) ≥ k M k (cid:48) ( B ) . For k (cid:48) = n 1 β ( R ) we have nM k (cid:48) ( R ) = O ( n · n − β ( R ) β ( R ) ) = O ( 1 ) while nM k (cid:48) ( B ) = Ω (cid:18) n · n − β ( B ) β ( R ) (cid:19) = Ω ( n 1 − β ( B ) β ( R ) ) = Ω ( n (cid:15) ) for (cid:15) > 0 . The result then follows since n ( R ) < n ( B ) and M k (cid:48) ( R ) < M k (cid:48) ( B ) for k (cid:48) > k . For the moment glass ceiling eﬀect we can show similarly : g = lim n →∞ (cid:80) k 2 M k ( R ) (cid:80) k 2 M k ( B ) = lim n →∞ O ( n 3 − β ( R ) ) Ω ( n 3 − β ( B ) ) = lim n →∞ O (cid:18) 1 n (cid:15) (cid:48) (cid:19) = 0 for some (cid:15) (cid:48) > 0 . The rest of this section sketches a proof of Theorem 4 . 12 . Note that m 0 , 0 ( B ) = d o ( B ) . We derive a recurrence for E ( m k , t ( B ) ) . A blue vertex of degree k at time t could have arisen from three scenarios : ( s1 ) at time t − 1 it was already a blue vertex of degree k and no edge was added to it at time t . ( s2 ) at time t − 1 it was a blue vertex of degree k − 1 and an edge was added to it at time t . ( s3 ) in the special case where k = 1 , at time t − 1 it did not exist yet and it has arrived as a new blue vertex at time t . Thus letting F t be the history of the process up to time t , for any k > 1 , the expectation of m k , t + 1 ( B ) conditioned on F t satisﬁes E ( m k , t + 1 ( B ) | F t ) = m k , t ( B ) (cid:18) 1 − rd t ( B ) ρ k dt ( B ) d t ( R ) + d t ( B ) ρ − ( 1 − r ) d t ( B ) k dt ( B ) d t ( R ) ρ + d t ( B ) (cid:19) + m k − 1 , t ( B ) (cid:18) rd t ( B ) ρ k − 1 dt ( B ) d t ( R ) + d t ( B ) ρ + ( 1 − r ) d t ( B ) k − 1 dt ( B ) d t ( R ) ρ + d t ( B ) (cid:19) . For k = 1 we similarly have E ( m 1 , t + 1 ( B ) | F t ) = m 1 , t ( B ) (cid:16) 1 − ρr d t ( R ) + d t ( B ) ρ − 1 − r d t ( R ) ρ + d t ( B ) (cid:17) + ( 1 − r ) . Recalling again that α t = d t ( R ) / ( 2 t ) , the above can be rewritten as E ( m k , t + 1 ( B ) | F t ) = m k , t ( B ) (cid:16) 1 − rρk 2 t ( α t + ( 1 − α t ) ρ ) − ( 1 − r ) k 2 t ( α t ρ + ( 1 − α t ) ) (cid:17) + m k − 1 , t ( B ) (cid:16) rρ ( k − 1 ) 2 t ( α t + ( 1 − α t ) ρ ) + ( 1 − r ) ( k − 1 ) 2 t ( α t ρ + ( 1 − α t ) ) (cid:17) and for k = 1 , E ( m 1 , t + 1 ( B ) | F t ) = m 1 , t ( B ) (cid:16) 1 − ρr 2 t ( α t + ( 1 − α t ) ρ ) − 1 − r 2 t ( α t ρ + ( 1 − α t ) ) (cid:17) + ( 1 − r ) . This can be expressed as E ( m k , t + 1 ( B ) | F t ) = m k , t ( B ) (cid:18) 1 − A t k t (cid:19) ( 5 ) + m k − 1 , t ( B ) A t k − 1 t , E ( m 1 , t + 1 ( B ) | F t ) = m 1 , t ( B ) (cid:18) 1 − A t t (cid:19) + ( 1 − r ) , ( 6 ) using the notation A t = rρ 2 α t + 2 ( 1 − α t ) ρ + ( 1 − r ) 2 α t ρ + 2 ( 1 − α t ) . Note that A t is a random variable so we next bound its divergence . Let C B = rρ 2 α + 2 ( 1 − α ) ρ + ( 1 − r ) 2 αρ + 2 ( 1 − α ) C R = ( 1 − r ) ρ 2 ( αρ + 1 − α ) + r 2 ( α + ( 1 − α ) ρ ) ) . We have Lemma 4 . 13 . Pr (cid:20) | A t − C B | > max (cid:26) 2 log t √ t , 1 3 √ t (cid:27)(cid:21) < 1 t 4 . A similar claim can be made for C R . This enables us to establish the following . Lemma 4 . 14 . • M 1 ( B ) exists and equals ( 1 − r ) / ( 1 + C B ) , • For k ≥ 2 , M k ( B ) exists and equals M k − 1 ( B ) · ( k − 1 ) C B / ( 1 + kC B ) , • M 1 ( R ) exists and equals r / ( 1 + C R ) , and • For k ≥ 2 , M k ( R ) exists and equals M k − 1 ( R ) · ( k − 1 ) C R / ( 1 + kC R ) , It is possible to show the following about C B and C R : Lemma 4 . 15 . • If 0 < r < 1 / 2 and 0 < ρ < 1 then C R < 12 < C B • If r = 1 / 2 then C R = C B = 1 / 2 . • If ρ = 0 or ρ = 1 then C R = C B = 1 / 2 . To show that the degree distributions of both the red and the blue vertices follow power laws we recall that a power law distribution has the following property : M k ∝ k − β for large k , where β is independent of k . If M k ∝ k − β , then M k M k − 1 = k − β ( k − 1 ) − β = (cid:18) 1 − 1 k (cid:19) β = 1 − β k + O (cid:18) 1 k 2 (cid:19) . Solving for the blue vertices , M k ( B ) and the blue exponent β ( B ) , and using Lemma 4 . 14 , we get : M k ( B ) M k − 1 ( B ) = ( k − 1 ) · C B 1 + k · C B = 1 − C B + 1 k · C B + 1 = 1 − 1 + 1 C B k + O (cid:18) 1 k 2 (cid:19) hence β ( B ) = 1 + 1 / C B . Similarly , for red vertices of degree k , M k ( R ) decays according to a power law with exponent β ( R ) = 1 + 1 / C R . Note that when C R < 12 < C B we have β ( R ) > 3 > β ( B ) thus proving Theorem 4 . 12 . 5 . EMPIRICAL OBSERVATIONS To provide empirical evidence illustrating the results of our analysis in real - life , we studied a mentor - student network of researchers in computer science , extracted from DBLP [ 28 ] , a dataset recording most of the publications in com - puter science . A ﬁltering process , described in detail in the full version of this paper , creates a list of edges connecting students to mentors . For each edge we determined the gen - der of the student and the mentor and the year in which the connection was established . The resulting network spans over 30 years and has 434232 authors and 389296 edges . As may be expected based on previously reported studies , our mentor - student network exhibits a minority - majority parti - tion ( namely , a low proportion of 21 % females ) , homophily , power law distribution and a glass ceiling eﬀect . Figure 4 ( a ) reveals that over time , the fraction of females in the network ( n ( R ) / n , the shaded red area ) has increased , but it is still below 21 % . Also the average degree for females vertices is lower ( 1 . 48 vs 1 . 87 ) . Figure 4 ( b ) presents an in - dication for homophily in the mentoring selection process . This is done by the homophily test of [ 11 ] , which compares the expected number of “mixed” ( female - male ) edges to the observed one ( see also Section 3 . 2 ) . Figure 5 presents indications for the glass ceiling eﬀect . Figure 5 ( a ) shows that the fraction of females among the vertices of degree k or higher , namely , top k ( R ) / top k ( B ) , de - creases continuously as k increases . The ﬁrst major decrease occurs when moving from the group of “students” ( i . e . , de - gree 1 vertices ) to the group of researchers of degree 2 or higher : the fraction of females drops from top 1 ( R ) ≈ 21 % to top 2 ( R ) < 15 % . It is important to note that the data indicates that even at the high end of the graph , a few fe - male researchers with very high degrees are still present ; however , our deﬁnitions for the glass ceiling ignore this ex - tremal eﬀect , which is caused by a few individuals , and con - centrate on the averages over large samples . Indeed , when the sample size is large enough , the fraction of the female researchers decreases . Figure 5 ( b ) shows a strong indica - tion that the degree distribution of the vertices ( females , males and combined ) follows a power law . This in turn is associated with a preferential attachment mechanism that is known to result in a power law degree distribution . Note that the power - law exponent β for the graph of the female 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 Year 0 20 40 60 80 100 C u m u l a t i v e D e g r ee S u m a s P e r c e n t a g e o f T o t a l D e g r ee S u m M % F % E [ M power % ] observed M power % E [ F power % ] F observed degree sum % ( a ) 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 Year 0 20000 40000 60000 80000 100000 120000 140000 C u m u l a t i v e N u m b e r o f M i x e d E dg e s E [ mixed edges ] observed female fraction , assume equal degree and no homophily E [ mixed edges ] observed degree , assume no homophily observed mixed edges ( b ) Figure 4 : Female power and homophily in the com - puter science mentor graph .

Males have more power than expected by their rate , while females have less power than ex - pected by their rate . ( b ) Evidence for homophily : a comparison of the observed number of “mixed” edges to the expected value assuming there is no homophily . We consider two cases : ( i ) the ex - pected number of mixed edges ignoring the diﬀer - ence between the male and female average degree ( expected : 127963 . 09 std : 293 . 08 ) and ( ii ) the ex - pected number of mixed edges while considering the diﬀerent degree sequences for males and females ( ex - pected : 110777 . 11 std : 281 . 52 ) . In both cases the observed value ( 101607 edges ) signiﬁcantly deviates from the expectation ( the error bars indicate the expected value ± 10 times the standard deviation ) with extremely low p - values . researchers is β = 2 . 91 ( in the best ﬁt ) , which is higher than the corresponding exponent in the graph for the male researchers , β = 2 . 58 . Our analysis ( presented in 4 . 2 and 4 . 3 ) establishes that if the degree distribution of both sub - populations follow a power law and the exponent for the minority sub - population is higher than that of the majority sub - population , then a strong moment glass ceiling eﬀect will appear . 6 . DISCUSSION One obvious limitation of our model is that it is some - what simplistic and captures only one possible mechanism for generating a glass ceiling eﬀect .

The exponent β for females is higher than for males , demonstrating the glass ceiling eﬀect . tant aspects of real life ( such as sexual tension , fear , family responsibilities and jealousy , to name a few ) and alterna - tive ( co - existing ) mechanisms that contribute to the eﬀect . For instance , our model cannot be used to explain the oc - currence of a glass ceiling eﬀect in contexts where pairwise individual interactions play a less dominant role than in academia . To account for the glass ceiling eﬀect in such contexts as well as others , one may consider alternative ex - planations . In particular , a common possible explanation is the “leaky pipeline” phenomenon , namely , the phenomenon that women tend to quit or slow down their careers in order to invest more time in their families . This phenomenon can be modeled mathematically in several diﬀerent ways . One such way is by introducing vertex departures in addition to vertex arrivals , with a bias in the form of increased depar - ture rate of the minority group . But in fact , such a dynamic “leaky pipeline” model allows several reasonable sub - models that will not generate a glass ceiling eﬀect , as well as some other sub - models that do . Moreover , the cause and eﬀect re - lationships between glass ceiling and leaky pipeline are not necessarily one - directional ; while the glass ceiling eﬀect may indeed be the outcome of the “leaky pipeline” phenomenon in certain settings , there are other settings where it may be its ( partial ) cause . An interesting direction for future work would be to describe a more complete model , most likely combining a number of diﬀerent mechanisms contributing jointly to the glass ceiling eﬀect . In any case , we ﬁnd it remarkable that the simple mathematical mechanism pre - sented here ( based on homophily ) is suﬃcient to explain ( at least parts of ) the glass ceiling eﬀect , despite the fact that it does not utilize the “leaky pipeline” . Our Findings may suggest ways to deal with the glass ceil - ing phenomenon . By better understanding the roots of the glass ceiling eﬀect , one can address each of the elements and attempt to mitigate them or deal with those elements that are easier to manage . Our research indicates that for cer - tain mechanisms involved in the formation of a glass ceiling , removing one element may eliminate the glass ceiling eﬀect . Hence , while it might be diﬃcult to modify the human ten - dencies of homophily and preferential attachment one could attempt to balance the proportions of minorities within the population or impose a proportional representation of suc - cessful women at the top level . Both of these options may be classiﬁed as variants of aﬃrmative action , but the latter , even if more common , seems to avoid the roots of the prob - lem . In particular , a more equally represented society could be created by encouraging minorities to enter the system , as our ﬁndings indicate that increasing the ratio of minori - ties at the entry stage may mitigate the glass ceiling eﬀect at least partially . This conclusion is in line with a common view [ 36 , 43 ] , which states that ﬁxing the “leaky pipeline” is key for a more equal gender distribution in science . By determining and examining the causes of the glass ceiling eﬀect , we can work on alleviating the glass ceiling eﬀect , resulting in a richer and more diverse community .
