The phenomenon now known as the enhanced permeability and retention ( EPR ) effect for lipid and macromolecular agents has been observed to be universal in solid tumors . Primarily , enhanced vascular permeability will sustain an adequate supply of nutrients and oxygen for rapid tumor growth . The EPR effect also provides a great opportunity for more selective targeting of lipid - or polymer - conjugated anticancer drugs , such as SMANCS and PK - 1 , to the tumor . In the present review , the basic characteristics of the EPR effect , particularly the factors involved , are described , as well as its modulation for improving delivery of macromolecular drugs to the tumor .

Concept of the enhanced permeability and retention ( EPR ) effect of macromolecules in solid tumors Our previous data using biocompatible plasma proteins and synthetic polymers or their various conjugates showed that these macromolecules are entrapped or accumulate in solid tumors and that they are retained there at high concentrations for prolonged periods ( more than 100 h ) [ e . g . 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 – Fig . 2 . Relationships for molecular weight and tumor uptake and 125 clearance of I - Tyr - HPMA - polymer drugs . Mice bearing S - 180 8 , 22 – 24 , 28 , 30 ] .

Thus , these retention , whereas low - molecular - weight substances macromolecular drugs and lipids are highly lymphot - were not retained but were returned to circulating ropic and possess excellent characteristics for blood by diffusion [ 22 ] , as was shown earlier [ 1 ] lymphatic delivery . These characteristics may be [ Fig . 4 ( A ) , ( B ) , ( C ) ] . used to prevent lymphatic metastasis . In addition , We found that macromolecules remain at high one difference between normal inﬂammatory tissue levels in circulating blood ; this phenomenon applies and tumor tissue is reﬂected in their clearance to most plasma proteins and biocompatible synthetic velocities : macromolecules delivered into the inter - polymers or their conjugates [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 22 – 24 , 30 – 32 ] . stitial space of normal inﬂammatory tissue will be Here , macromolecules are deﬁned as larger than 40 cleared more rapidly than those in tumor tissue , kDa ( Fig . 2 ) .

However , tumor blood ﬂow , as determined by the hydrogen gas clearance method , was suppressed almost 80 – 90 % [ 52 ] [ Fig . 11 ( B ) ] . On the contrary , vascular permeability in tumors was found to in - crease signiﬁcantly . A similar effect was observed after injection of the prostaglandin I analogue 2 (cid:210) beraprost ( Dorner , Yamanouchi / Toray , Japan ) , which exhibits a much longer half - life in vivo than does prostaglandin I . Both temocapril and beraprost 2 sodium increased vascular permeability to a signiﬁ - cant extent ( unpubl . data ) . Thus , it is speculated that very local tumor blood pressure became nil due to vascular dilatation as a result of bradykinin , NO , or prostaglandin I analogues , because such mediators 2 and their receptors are more abundant in tumor than in normal tissue . Blood ﬂow in normal tissues remained unchanged because such effectors and their receptors remain unchanged . 6 . Modulation of vascular permeability by inhibitors of vascular mediators or antagonists By the use of ACEIs such as enalapril or temocap - ril , which also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin as described above , one can ultimately activate endothelial NOS because the level of bradykinin is increased . Thus , the EPR effect becomes more apparent , and such inhibitors enhance delivery of macromolecular drugs or components to the tumor . In addition , elevation of blood pressure by infus - ing angiotensin II is another way to enhance drug delivery to the tumor by two to three times while reducing delivery to normal organs such as bone Fig . 9 .
