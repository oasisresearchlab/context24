Viral nucleoprotein ( NP ) , a major RNP component , tempo - rarily localized to the nucleoli of virus - infected cells . Mutations in a nucleolar localiza - tion signal ( NoLS ) on NP abolished double - helical RNP formation , resulting in a loss of viral RNA synthesis ability , whereas ectopic fusion of the NoLS enabled the NP mutant to form functional double - helical RNPs . Furthermore , nucleolar disruption of virus - infected cells inhibited NP assembly into double - helical RNPs , resulting in decreased viral RNA synthesis .

IMPORTANCE In ﬂ uenza A virus ribonucleoprotein complex ( RNP ) is responsible for vi - ral genome replication , thus playing essential roles in the virus life cycle . RNP forma - tion occurs in the nuclei of infected cells ; however , little is known about the nuclear domains involved in this process . Here , we reveal by using several microscopic tech - niques that its major component , viral nucleoprotein ( NP ) , temporally stays in the nucleolus , the assembly site of ribosomal RNAs / proteins , and that the formation is dependent on a nucleolar localization signal in NP . We also show that nucleolar dis - ruption causes abortive RNP formation , resulting in a signi ﬁ cant reduction in virus replication . Our ﬁ ndings demonstrate the importance of the nucleolus as the site of RNP formation and for virus replication . KEYWORDS RNP , assembly , in ﬂ uenza virus , nucleolus I n ﬂ uenza A virus , belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family , possesses eight - seg - mented , single - stranded , negative - sense RNA as its genome . Each viral genomic RNA ( vRNA ) segment exists as a ribonucleoprotein complex ( RNP ) associated with multiple nucleoproteins ( NPs ) and a heterotrimeric RNA - dependent RNA polymerase complex composed of PB2 , PB1 , and PA subunits ( 1 ) . The RNPs , which are ﬂ exible double - stranded helices ( width , ; 10 nm ; length , 30 to 120 nm ) ( 2 ) , are responsible for tran - scription and replication of the vRNAs . Upon transcription , vRNA is transcribed into 5 9 - capped and 3 9 - polyadenylated mRNA by the polymerase complex in a primer - dependent manner . During genome replication , the vRNA is copied into a cRNA replicative interme - diate by a cis - acting viral polymerase complex , and the cRNA acts as a template for gener - ating more vRNAs , with involvement of a trans - activating / trans - acting viral polymerase complex ( 3 , 4 ) . These replication processes are concomitant with RNP assembly ; the 5 9 terminals of the nascent vRNA and cRNA are associated with a newly synthesized viral Editor RachelFearns , Boston University School of Medicine Copyright © 2022 Miyamoto et al .

Unlike most RNA viruses , in ﬂ uenza A virus transcribes and replicates its genome in the nuclei of virus - infected cells ( 6 ) . Accordingly , in ﬂ uenza A virus transcription , replica - tion , and RNP formation heavily rely on host nuclear machineries . Upon initiation of vRNA transcription , the viral polymerase complex in the RNP binds to the carboxy - ter - minal domain of host RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) ( 7 ) . Then , the PB2 subunit binds to the 5 9 - cap structure of host pre - mRNAs or small nuclear / nucleolar RNAs ( 8 , 9 ) , and the PA subunit cleaves and snatches the 5 9 - capped fragment for use as a primer ( 10 – 12 ) . The requirement of Pol II for initiation of viral mRNA synthesis indicates that the genome transcription takes place in the nucleoplasm , near host Pol II localization . Genome rep - lication and double - helical RNP formation reportedly involves several intranuclear host factors , such as minichromosome maintenance helicase complex , UAP56 , Tat - SF1 , and ANP32 ( 13 ) . In addition , recent studies have demonstrated the importance of the intra - nuclear proteins fragile X mental retardation protein ( FMRP ) , protein kinase C , and LYAR in the replication - coupled RNP assembly ( 14 – 16 ) . However , since these host pro - teins are localized in different intranuclear domains , the subnuclear site of vRNA repli - cation and RNP formation remains unidenti ﬁ ed . Previously , we showed that a mutant in ﬂ uenza A virus lacking the hemagglutinin ( HA ) vRNA segment ef ﬁ ciently incorporates 18S and 28S ribosomal RNAs ( rRNAs ) into progeny virions instead of the omitted HA vRNA and that those rRNAs are associated with viral NPs and form RNP - like structures ( 17 ) . Considering that NPs are localized to not only the nucleus but also the nucleolus ( 18 , 19 ) , we hypothesized that assembly of NPs into a double - helical RNP relies on the nucleolus , the site of rRNA transcription , pre - rRNA processing , and ribosomal assembly . Thus , we employed several microscopic and biochemical approaches to investigate the importance of the nucleolus in func - tional RNP formation using NP mutants lacking an intrinsic nucleolar localization signal , as well as a compound that causes nucleolar disruption in cells . RESULTS Nucleolar localization of NP in virus - infected cells . To con ﬁ rm that de novo - syn - thesized NP is localized to the nucleoli of virus - infected cells , Madin - Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cells were infected with in ﬂ uenza A virus and ﬁ xed over time . The virus - infected cells were treated with a protease to remove highly condensed host nucleolar proteins and RNAs before immunostaining , which is an established method to detect antigens within the nucleolus ( 20 ) . Immunostaining with an anti - NP antibody showed that newly synthesized NP was temporarily colocalized with nucleolin / C23 , a nucleolar marker , 5 to 7 h postinfection ( hpi ) ( Fig . 1A ) . The localization pattern of the NP at each time point was as follows : the NP was detected only in the nucleoplasm at 3 hpi , in both the nucleoplasm and the nucleolus at 5 and 7 hpi , and mainly in the cytoplasm at 9 hpi . The localization pattern suggests that nucleolar localization of NP is speci ﬁ c in the early stage of infection and that the NP passes through the nucleolus before nuclear export . Importantly , the NPs were also observed in the nucleolus of cells infected with different virus strains ( A / California / 04 / 2009 [ H1N1 ] , A / Victoria / 361 / 2011 [ H3N2 ] , and A / Udorn / 307 / 1972 [ H3N2 ] ) ( see Fig . S1 in the supplemental material ) , indicating that the nucleolar localization of NP is a common phenomenon during the in ﬂ uenza virus life cycle . To further con ﬁ rm the nucleolar localization of NP biochemically , we separated vi - rus - infected cells into cytoplasmic , nucleoplasmic , and nucleolar fractions at 4 hpi ; a - tubulin ( cytoplasm marker ) , histone H3 ( nucleoplasm marker ) , and nucleophosmin 1 / B23 ( NPM1 , nucleolus marker ) were detected in the expected fractions ( Fig . 1B ) . Consistent with the immunostaining data , the majority of NP was detected in the nu - clear fraction at 4 hpi , in which similar amounts of NP were detected in both nucleo - plasmic and nucleolar fractions . Likewise , a substantial proportion of PB2 , PB1 , and PA was detected in the nucleolar fraction , as well as in the nuclear fraction .

Importance of nucleolar NP localization for functional RNP formation . Of the RNP components , only NP possesses a nucleolar localization signal ( NoLS ) in addition to a nu - clear localization signal ( 18 , 21 , 22 ) . To investigate the importance of nucleolar NP local - ization for RNP formation , we constructed two NoLS - mutant NPs : an NP NoLSmut with ala - nine substitutions in the NoLS that localizes only in the nucleoplasm and a reverse mutant NoLS - NP NoLSmut with an intact NoLS fused to the amino terminus of NP NoLSmut that facilitates its nucleolar localization ( see Fig . S2A and B ) ( 18 ) . Strand - speci ﬁ c RT - qPCR after in vivo reconstruction of RNP containing a full - length vRNA demonstrated that the RNPs comprising NP NoLSmut exhibited a signi ﬁ cant reduction in vRNA , cRNA , and mRNA produc - tion , whereas the RNPs comprising NoLS - NP NoLSmut showed relatively ef ﬁ cient production ( Fig . 2A ) . The results are consistent with those obtained using a luciferase - based minige - nome assay ( Fig . 2B ) , as reported previously ( 18 ) , and further demonstrate that the nucle - olar localization of NP is critical for both transcription and replication .

We coexpressed PB2 - FLAG , PB1 , PA , and HA vRNA , together with wild - type NP ( NP wt ) or NP mutant , to reconstitute RNPs in the cells . The cells were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti - FLAG anti - body , and the precipitates were assessed by Western blotting and RT - PCR ( Fig . 2C ) . NP wt , PB1 , and PA were coprecipitated with PB2 , and the full - length HA vRNA was also detected in the precipitate ( Fig . 2C ) . In addition , the immunoprecipitated RNPs produced HA mRNA by in vitro transcription ( Fig . 2D ) , indicating the assembly of these viral components into functional RNPs . However , NP NoLSmut was barely coprecipitated with PB2 , although PB1 and PA were coprecipitated ( Fig . 2C ) . Furthermore , full - length HA vRNA was barely detected in the precipitate , and the immunoprecipitated RNPs did not produce HA mRNA ( Fig . 2D ) , indicating that NP NoLSmut was not properly assembled into functional RNPs , although the heterotrimeric viral polymerase subunit was assembled . Intriguingly , NoLS - NP NoLSmut , PB1 , and PA were adequately coprecipitated with PB2 , from which full - length HA vRNA was detected ( Fig . 2C ) . Moreover , the immu - noprecipitated RNPs produced HA mRNA ( Fig . 2D ) , suggesting that some NoLS - NP NoLSmut was assembled into functional RNPs . Taken together , these results indicate that nucleolar localization of NP is indispensable for functional RNP formation . Ultrastructural analysis of the reconstituted RNPs provided further evidence for the necessity of nucleolar NP localization for assembly into RNPs . Using high - speed atomic force microscopy ( HS - AFM ) , which enables near - native topological ultrastructure visu - alization of biological specimens , such as in ﬂ uenza virus HA and NP , in solution without any ﬁ xation , hydration , and staining ( 23 – 26 ) , we investigated the morphology of respec - tive reconstituted RNPs after immunoprecipitation and puri ﬁ cation ( see Fig . S3A ) . Approximately 70 % of the NP wt - constituted RNPs showed double - helical structure with a uniform height of ; 9 nm ( Fig . 2E to G ) . These RNPs were morphologically indistin - guishable from those puri ﬁ ed from in ﬂ uenza virions ( Fig . 2E ; see also Fig . S3B ) . In con - trast , NP NoLSmut was barely assembled into double - helical structures and the resultant RNPs showed pleomorphic morphology with a height of # 5 nm , where string - like struc - tures , probably naked RNAs based on their structure , were exposed ( Fig . 2E to G ) . Importantly , NoLS - NP NoLSmut was also assembled into double - helical RNPs ( ; 65 % of the RNPs ) ( Fig . 2E to G ) . Immuno - electron microscopy con ﬁ rmed that both double - helical RNPs and the pleomorphic aggregates comprised NP and viral polymerase ( Fig . 2H ) , indi - cating that the pleomorphic aggregates are abortive RNPs . Taken together , these data demonstrate that nucleolar NP localization is critical for functional double - helical RNP formation . Impact of nucleolar disruption on functional RNP formation . Considering the necessity of nucleolar NP localization for proper RNP formation , nucleolar structure dis - ruption would heavily impact RNP formation . To test this hypothesis , we used a selec - tive RNA polymerase I ( Pol I ) inhibitor , CX5461 ( 27 ) ; inhibition of Pol I activity that tran - scribes 47S rRNA ( pre - rRNA ) causes translocation of some nucleolar proteins to the nucleoplasm , resulting in nucleolar disruption ( 28 , 29 ) . Actinomycin D , which inhibits both Pol I and Pol II activities , was used as the control . RT - qPCR and immunoblotting revealed that CX5461 treatment ( 2 to 10 m M ) inhibited only pre - rRNA transcription ( Pol I ) without the inhibition of pre - mRNA transcription ( Pol II ) and translation ( Fig . 3A and B ) , whereas actinomycin D treatment ( 10 m g / mL ) suppressed the transcription of both FIG 2 Legend ( Continued ) the size markers , synthesized in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase .

( A ) Selectivity of the RNA polymerase inhibitors on Pol I and II activities . A549 cells were pretreated with CX5461 , 10 m g / mL actinomycin D ( Act D ) , or 1 % ( Continued on next page ) Miyamoto et al . ® January / February 2022 Volume 13 Issue 1 e03315 - 21 mbio . asm . org 6 pre - rRNA and pre - mRNA ( Fig . 3A ) , indicating that CX5461 treatment speci ﬁ cally inhibits Pol I activity . We con ﬁ rmed that 10 m M CX5461 treatment did not show signi ﬁ cant cy - totoxicity via , for example , topoisomerase II poisoning ( 30 ) ( Fig . 3K ) . In addition to an rRNA staining dye , immunostaining with an antibody against nucleolin , a nucleolar marker , showed that nucleolin in CX5461 - treated cells was translocated from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm in a concentration - dependent manner and that the mor - phology of the pleomorphic nucleoli was altered into small spherules ( Fig . 3C ) , demon - strating that CX5461 caused nucleolar disruption through Pol I activity inhibition . To determine whether nucleolar disruption affects RNP formation , A549 cells were infected with a recombinant in ﬂ uenza A virus expressing C - terminal FLAG - tagged PB2 ( PB2 - FLAG virus ) and treated with 10 m M CX5461 at 2 hpi . The RNPs were then immu - noprecipitated with an anti - FLAG antibody at 4 . 5 hpi ( Fig . 3D ; see also Fig . S3C ) . CX5461 treatment modestly decreased the amount of immunoprecipitated NP , as well as PB1 and PA subunits , in these cells , although viral protein expression levels were comparable , or marginally lower , compared to those in control cells ( Fig . 3D ) , suggest - ing that nucleolar disruption impacted RNP formation . Importantly , ultrastructural anal - ysis of the immunoprecipitated and puri ﬁ ed RNPs using HS - AFM revealed a signi ﬁ cant reduction in ef ﬁ ciency of double - helical RNP formation in CX5461 - treated cells ( Fig . 3E and F ) . Most of the RNPs immunoprecipitated from CX5461 - treated cells were pleo - morphic aggregates ( Fig . 3G ; see also Fig . S3D ) that were similar to the abortive RNPs composed of NP NoLSmut ( Fig . 2E and F ) , while most RNPs immunoprecipitated from con - trol cells had double - helical structures ( Fig . 3F ) . Consistent with the ultrastructural anal - ysis , HA vRNA , cRNA , and mRNA production ( Fig . 3H ) and viral growth ( Fig . 3I and J ) were decreased in CX5461 - treated cells in a concentration - dependent manner , without any cell toxicity ( Fig . 3K ) . Thus , these results demonstrate that the nucleolus is required for proper assembly of NPs into functional double - helical RNPs . DISCUSSION In ﬂ uenza virus RNP formation coupled with vRNA replication occurs in the nucleus . However , it remains largely uncertain how nuclear domains are involved in the pro - cess . In this study , we showed that the nucleolus is the essential site for formation of functional RNPs with a double - helical structure .

In addition , nucleolar disruption signi ﬁ cantly reduced virus replication , as well as genome transcription and replication . These results demonstrated that NP migration into the nucleolus is a critical step for functional double - helical RNP formation and that the nucleolus plays an important role in the in ﬂ uenza virus life cycle . Using two NP mutants , we showed that nucleolar NP localization via NoLS is required for functional RNP formation ( Fig . 2 ) . Because both NP mutants contain ala - nine substitutions in residues 213 , 214 , and 216 , which are located close to the RNA - binding groove formed by R74 , R75 , R174 , R175 , and R221 ( NP - G1 region ) ( 31 – 33 ) , such mutations potentially alter the RNA - binding property of NP and subsequent RNP formation ( 34 ) . However , NoLS - NP NoLSmut , which contains alanine substitutions in the intrinsic NoLS but has an ectopic NoLS at the amino terminus , had the ability to form functional double - helical RNPs ( see Fig . S2B and Fig . 2E to G ) , indicating that the intro - duction of mutations in the NoLS does not affect the in cellulo RNA - binding property of NP for RNP formation . Nevertheless , the RNPs comprising NoLS - NP NoLSmut showed signi ﬁ cantly lower polymerase activity than those comprising NP wt ( Fig . 2B ) . This reduction in polymerase activity would be due to the N - terminal - fused NoLS because the NoLS - NP wt mutant , which has an additional NoLS at the N terminus of NP wt ( see Fig . S4A ) , showed signi ﬁ cantly lower polymerase activity than NP wt in a minigenome assay ( see Fig . S4B ) . Previously , Ozawa et al . reported that NP - NLS2mut , which is the same mutant as the NP NoLSmut used in our study , exhibits almost no transcription and replication activity ( 18 ) , which is consistent with our result ( Fig . 2B ) and con ﬁ rms that the NoLS is indispensable for functional RNP formation . Oddly enough , Ozawa et al . also show in the same study that NP - NLS2mut is able to support infectious virus - like particle ( VLP ) formation ( 18 ) , which seems to contradict the importance of NoLS for functional RNP formation . It remains unclear why infectious VLPs are produced in the absence of functional RNPs . However , one possible explanation is that , because NP NoLSmut forms abortive RNPs together with viral polymerase and vRNA ( Fig . 2C and H ) , such abortive RNPs are incorporated into VLPs . In that study , because cells are infected with mixtures of VLPs and wild - type helper virus , vRNA in the abortive RNP might be transcribed and replicated with the aid of the helper virus , resulting in the detection of infectious VLP formation . In the future , it might be interesting to examine whether abortive RNPs are also packaged into virus particles . In our HS - AFM observation , almost all the RNPs puri ﬁ ed from virions had helical structures ( Fig . 2E ; see also Fig . S3B ) , suggesting that RNPs within the virions exist as helices as reported previously ( 35 , 36 ) . In contrast , 65 to 70 % of RNPs reconstituted in plasmid - transfected cells showed helical structures , and the remainder had pleomor - phic structures similar to RNPs reconstituted using NP NoLSmut ( Fig . 2E and G ; see also Fig . S3B ) . The reason for the reduced proportion of helical RNP formation remains unclear . However , because not only completed RNPs but also nascent RNPs would exist in the plasmid - transfected cells , it is possible that the pleomorphic structures rep - resent these nascent RNPs in the course of assembly . Nucleolar disruption by a speci ﬁ c Pol I inhibitor disrupted RNP component assem - bly into functional double - helical RNPs ( Fig . 3 ) . Since Pol I - mediated pre - rRNA tran - scription is required for nucleolar structure maintenance ( 28 , 29 ) , it is possible that cer - tain nucleolar proteins , which are required for vRNA replication - coupled RNP formation , were translocated outside the nucleolus by the Pol I inhibitor treatment . Several host nucleolar proteins , including nucleolin and NPM1 , reportedly interact with NP , and some nucleolar proteins , such as nucleolin , NPM1 , LYAR , and FMRP , facilitate vRNA replication and RNP assembly ( 14 , 16 , 37 – 39 ) . Thus , inhibition of Pol I activity would change their localizations and disrupt their proper interactions with NP in the nucleolus , resulting in abortive RNP formation . Several studies have implied the involvement of the nucleolus in vRNA replication . Khatchikian et al . reported that 54 host - 28S - rRNA - derived nucleotides are inserted into the HA vRNA during viral replication via genetic recombination ( 40 ) . This Miyamoto et al . ® January / February 2022 Volume 13 Issue 1 e03315 - 21 mbio . asm . org 8 recombination is probably caused by a polymerase jumping mechanism ( 41 , 42 ) , wherein the viral polymerase transitions between HA vRNA and an adjacent host 28S rRNA during vRNA replication . This suggests that the replication occurs at the site of rRNA transcription or at its adjacent site , for example , in or near the nucleolus . An in situ hybridization study on salmon anemia virus - infected cells ( also belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family ) showed nucleolar localization of antigenomic as well as genomic RNA ( 43 ) . Although the identity of the anti - genomic RNA in the nucleolus remains uncertain , considering that viral mRNA is transcribed in the vicinity of Pol II in the nucleoplasm , the antigenomic RNA likely represents cRNA replicated from vRNA template . In addition to these reports , because the nucleolus exists as a liquid condensate ( 44 ) and would result in an increase in the local concentration of NPs , which facilitates NP assembly into the RNP ( 5 ) , the nucleolus might act as a site of vRNA replication and RNP formation . Although we showed the presence of all viral polymerase subunits , as well as NP , in the nucleolus of virus - infected cells ( Fig . 1B ) , it remains unclear whether NPs are assembled into double - helical RNPs together with the polymerase complex in the nucleolus . Further investigation is needed to identify the site of RNP formation . In conclusion , we demonstrated that the formation of functional double - helical RNP relies on nucleolar migration of NPs . Our results highlight the importance of the nucle - olus during the in ﬂ uenza virus life cycle . Further studies on intranucleolar host factors responsible for RNP formation are necessary to understand the detailed mechanisms of RNP formation , which would contribute to the development of novel antivirals against in ﬂ uenza viruses . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell lines . MDCK cells , kindly provided by Y . Kawaoka ( The University of Tokyo ) , were grown in mini - mal essential medium ( MEM ; Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , Waltham , MA ) containing 5 % newborn calf serum ( 16010 - 159 ; Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) . Human embryonic kidney 293 ( HEK293 , CRL - 1573 ) and 293T ( HEK293T , CRL - 3216 ) cells and human lung carcinoma ( A549 , CCL - 185 ) cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection ( Manassas , VA ) and maintained in Dulbecco modi ﬁ ed Eagle medium ( Merck , Germany ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FB - 1365 ; Biosera , France ) . Cultures were maintained at 37°C in a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . Viruses were grown in MEM containing 0 . 3 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA / MEM ) . Plasmid construction . pCAGGS / NP NoLSmut and pCAGGS / NoLS - NP NoLSmut were constructed using inverse PCR with sequences similar to those previously reported ( pCAGGS / NP - NLS2mut and pCAGGS / NLS2 - NP - NLS2mut , respectively ) ( 18 ) . To generate pCAGGS / PB2 - FLAG , the PB2 open reading frame ( ORF ) and FLAG ( DYKDDDDK ) were linked with a linker ( AAA ) . pPol I / PB2 - FLAG was constructed by inserting the PB2 - FLAG ORF with a stop codon into a truncated pPol I / PB2 plasmid with the 3 9 noncod - ing region and an additional 143 nucleotides of the 5 9 terminal coding and noncoding regions ( 45 ) . Inhibitors and antibodies . The inhibitors used were : CX5461 ( CS - 0568 ; ChemScene , Deerpark , NJ ) , actinomycin D ( A1410 ; Merck ) , and cycloheximide ( 037 - 20991 ; Fuji ﬁ lm , Japan ) . The primary antibodies used for immuno ﬂ uorescence , Western blotting , and immuno - electron microscopy were as follows : anti - NP mouse monoclonal ( 46 ) , anti - NP rabbit polyclonal ( GTX125989 ; GeneTex , Irvine , CA ) , anti - PB2 goat polyclonal ( sc - 17603 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Dallas , TX ) , anti - PB1 goat polyclonal ( sc - 17601 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , anti - PA rabbit polyclonal ( GTX125932 ; GeneTex ) , anti - nucleolin rabbit polyclonal ( ab22758 ; Abcam , UK ) , anti - nucleophosmin mouse monoclonal ( ab10530 ; Abcam ) , anti - a - tubulin rabbit polyclonal ( PM054 ; Medical and Biological Laboratories , Aichi , Japan ) , anti - histone H3 rabbit polyclonal ( GTX122148 ; GeneTex ) , and anti - FLAG mouse monoclonal ( M185 - A48 ; Medical and Biological Laboratories ) antibodies . The secondary antibodies used were as follows : Alexa Fluor 488 - conjugated anti - mouse ( A11001 ; Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) , anti - rabbit ( A11008 ; Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) , and anti - goat ( A11055 ; Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) antibodies ; Alexa Fluor 555 - conjugated anti - mouse ( A21422 ; Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) and anti - rabbit ( A21428 ; Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) antibodies ; HRP - conjugated anti - mouse ( NA931 ; GE Healthcare , Chicago , IL ) , anti - rabbit ( NA934 ; GE Healthcare ) , and anti - goat ( ab6741 ; Abcam ) antibodies ; and 6 - nm gold - conjugated anti - mouse ( 715 - 195 - 150 ; Jackson ImmunoResearch , West Grove , PA ) and anti - rabbit ( 711 - 195 - 152 ; Jackson ImmunoResearch ) antibodies . Generation of recombinant viruses by reverse genetics . Reverse genetics was performed using pPol I plasmids containing cDNA sequences of the A / WSN / 1933 ( WSN ; H1N1 ) viral genes between the human Pol I promoter and mouse Pol I terminator as described previously ( 47 ) . Brie ﬂ y , eight pPol I plas - mids and pCAGGS protein - expression plasmids for PB2 , PB1 , PA , and NP were mixed with TransIT - 293 ( Mirus Bio , Madison , WI ) and added to HEK293T cells . At 48 h posttransfection , the cells were treated with 1 m g / mL TPCK - trypsin ( Worthington Biochemical , Lakewood , OH ) for 30 min and centrifuged at 1 , 750 (cid:1) g for 15 min at 4°C , and the supernatant was collected and stored at 2 80°C . PB2 - FLAG virus was generated by replacing pPol I / PB2 wt with pPol I / PB2 - FLAG plasmid . For subsequent viral ampli ﬁ cation , Role of Nucleolus in In ﬂ uenza Virus RNP Formation ® January / February 2022 Volume 13 Issue 1 e03315 - 21 mbio . asm . org 9 MDCK cells were infected at an MOI of 10 2 5 , followed by incubation for 2 days in BSA / MEM containing 1 m g / mL TPCK - trypsin . Viral infection . The WSN , A / California / 04 / 2009 ( H1N1 ) , A / Victoria / 361 / 2011 ( H3N2 ) , and A / Udorn / 307 / 1972 ( H3N2 ) strains were used in this study . The WSN strain was used unless otherwise stated . Cells were washed with BSA / MEM , inoculated with virus , and placed on ice for 1 h . After removal of the inocu - lum and addition of fresh BSA / MEM , the infected cells were incubated at 37°C in a 5 % CO 2 incubator . For viral growth analysis , 0 . 2 m g / mL TPCK - trypsin and 1 % dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) were added in BSA / MEM . Viral titers were determined by plaque assays using MDCK cells . Immuno ﬂ uorescence . Cells were plated in 8 - well chamber slides ( Matsunami , Osaka , Japan ) coated with rat collagen I ( Corning , Corning , NY ) . Infected or transfected cells were ﬁ xed in 4 % paraformalde - hyde ( PFA ) in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ; Nacalai Tesque , Japan ) for 10 min and then permeabilized with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 5 min . The cells were blocked with Blocking One solution ( Nacalai Tesque ) for 30 min , followed by incubation with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C and secondary anti - bodies for 1 h at room temperature . For nuclei and rRNA staining , the cells were treated with Hoechst 33342 ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) and Nucleolus Bright Red ( Dojindo , Japan ) , respectively , for 10 min . Section images were recorded using DeltaVision Elite ( GE Healthcare ) with a 60 (cid:1) oil objective and then deconvolved and projected using the Quick Projection tool by softWoRx ( GE Healthcare ) . Protease treatment . Since the optimal condition for protease treatment depends on protease type , lot , and cell strain ( 20 ) , we recommend verifying the protease concentration and incubation time until the refracted light on the nucleolar surface is almost unable to be observed by light microscopy . After permeabilization , the cells were washed twice in cold PBS on ice and placed in cold 5 m g / mL TPCK - tryp - sin in PBS . The slides were incubated on a plate incubator ( MyBL - P2 ; AS ONE , Osaka , Japan ) at 37°C for 5 min , followed by incubation with cold 4 % PFA in PBS ( ﬁ nal concentration 2 % ) on ice for 30 min to ter - minate the reaction . Thereafter , the cells were washed in PBS and blocked as described above . Western blotting . Western blotting was performed as previously described ( 17 ) . Brie ﬂ y , the cells or samples described below were dissolved with 2 (cid:1) Tris - glycine SDS sample buffer ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) , boiled for 5 min in the absence of reducing agent , and subjected to SDS - PAGE . The proteins were then electroblotted onto Immobilon - P transfer membranes ( Merck ) . The membranes were blocked with Blocking One for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibodies over - night at 4°C . After incubation with HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature , the blots were developed using Chemi - Lumi One Super ( Nacalai Tesque ) . Cell viability . Cell viability was assessed with a CellTiter - Glo luminescent cell viability assay ( Promega ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . Brie ﬂ y , CellTiter - Glo reagent ( equal in volume to the culture medium ) was added to A549 cells . The plates were shaken on a plate shaker for 2 min to induce cell lysis , incubated at room temperature for 10 min , and subjected to luminescence measurement . Minigenome assay . A plasmid - based minigenome assay was performed as described previously ( 18 ) . Brie ﬂ y , HEK293 cells were cotransfected with pCAGGS / PB2 , pCAGGS / PB1 , pCAGGS / PA , pCAGGS / NP , and pPol I / NP ( 0 ) Fluc ( 0 ) expressing a ﬁ re ﬂ y luciferase gene - encoding viral minigenome . pGL4 . 74 [ hRluc / TK ] ( Promega ) was also transfected as an internal control . At 24 h posttransfection , the luciferase activity was measured using a dual - luciferase reporter assay system ( Promega ) . RNP reconstruction and immunoprecipitation . HEK293T cells were plated in two 10 - cm 2 dishes and transfected using PEI MAX ( Polysciences , Warrington , PA ) with RNP expression plasmids ( 3 m g / mL each of pCAGGS / PB2 - FLAG , pCAGGS / PB1 , pCAGGS / PA , and pCAGGS / NP ; 300 ng / m L pPol I / HA ) . At 2 days posttrans - fection , the cells were suspended in cold PBS and pelleted by centrifugation at 780 (cid:1) g for 10 min at 4°C . The pellets were resuspended in 500 m L of lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 10 % glycerol , 0 . 05 % NP - 40 , 2 mM dithiothreitol [ DTT ] , 10 mM Ribonucleoside - Vanadyl complex [ New England Biolabs , Beverley , MA ] , 1 (cid:1) cOmplete EDTA - free protease inhibitor [ Roche ] ) , rotated for 15 min at 4°C , and centrifuged at 20 , 000 (cid:1) g for 15 min at 4°C . The pellets were resuspended in the buffer and incu - bated with additional 80 m L of anti - FLAG M2 af ﬁ nity gel ( Merck ) on a rotator overnight at 4°C . The gels were washed once with lysis buffer and three times with wash buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 200 mM NaCl , 50 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 mM DTT ) and then eluted in 150 m L of wash buffer with 500 ng / m L FLAG peptide ( Merck ) by rotation on a rotator for 30 min at 4°C . The cell lysates and eluates were electrophoresed on an SDS - polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted . RNP puri ﬁ cation . RNP puri ﬁ cation was performed as described previously ( 48 ) . To prepare virion - derived RNPs , MDCK cells were infected with the virus , followed by incubation at 37°C for 2 days . Virions in the supernatants were puri ﬁ ed by ultracentrifugation through a 30 % ( wt / wt ) sucrose cushion . The pel - lets were resuspended in PBS . The puri ﬁ ed virions were lysed in a solution containing 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 100 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , 2 % lysolecithin , 2 % Triton X - 100 , 5 % glycerol , and 1 U / m L RNase inhibitor ( Promega ) for 1 h at 30°C . The lysed or immunoprecipitated RNPs were ultracentrifuged through a glycerol gradient ( 30 % – 70 % ) containing 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 and 150 mM NaCl at 245 , 000 (cid:1) g for 3 h at 4°C . Each fraction was electrophoresed on an SDS - polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted with an anti - NP antibody ( see Fig . S3A and C ) . NP - enriched fractions 7 and 8 were used for RNP observations . In vitro transcription of RNPs . In vitro transcription of RNPs was performed as described previously ( 26 ) . The puri ﬁ ed RNP ( 0 . 01 mg / mL ) was incubated in a buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl buffer [ pH 7 . 9 ] ; 5 mM MgCl 2 ; 40 mM KCl ; 1 mM DTT ; 10 m g / mL actinomycin D ; 1 mM [ each ] ATP , CTP , and GTP ; 0 . 25 m Ci / m L [ a - 32 P ] UTP ; 0 . 05 mM UTP ; 1 U / m L RNasin Plus RNase inhibitor ; and 1 mM ApG [ IBA , Gottingen , Germany ] ) at 30°C for 15 min . RNA was puri ﬁ ed by using an RNeasy minikit , mixed with an equal volume of 2 (cid:1) RNA Loading Dye ( New England Biolabs ) , heated at 90°C for 2 min , and immediately chilled on ice . The sample was electrophoresed on a 4 % polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea in 0 . 5 (cid:1) TBE buffer Miyamoto et al . ® January / February 2022 Volume 13 Issue 1 e03315 - 21 mbio . asm . org 10 ( Nacalai Tesque ) at 120 V for 5 h . The gel was dried at 80°C for 2 h , exposed to an imaging plate ( BAS - MS 2025 ; Fuji ﬁ lm ) for 12 to 24 h , and scanned with a Typhoon 3000 Phosphorimager ( GE Healthcare ) . To prepare vRNA markers , all eight vRNA segments of the in ﬂ uenza virus were transcribed using 0 . 25 m Ci / m L [ a - 32 P ] UTP and a RiboMAX Large Scale RNA Production System - T7 , as described above . The tran - scribed RNAs were puri ﬁ ed and mixed before electrophoresis . High - speed atomic force microscopy . HS - AFM analysis of RNPs was performed as described previ - ously ( 26 ) . The samples were prepared in a microcentrifuge tube , dropped onto freshly cleaved mica with - out any surface modi ﬁ cation , and incubated for 1 to 5 min at room temperature ( ; 24°C ) . The samples on the mica surface were then washed with imaging buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7 . 9 ] , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 40 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT ) and observed in the imaging buffer at room temperature ( ; 24°C ) using as SS - NEX high - speed atomic force microscope ( RIBM , Tsukuba , Japan ) . Images were taken at a two images / s using cantilevers ( BL - AC10DS ; Olympus , Japan ) with a 0 . 1 - N / m spring constant and a resonance frequency in water of 0 . 6 MHz . To increase the resolution , the electron - beam deposited tips were fabricated using phenol or ferro - cene powder ( 49 ) . All HS - AFM images were viewed and analyzed using Kodec software ( version 4 . 4 . 7 . 39 ) ( 50 ) . A low - pass ﬁ lter and a ﬂ attening ﬁ lter were applied to individual images to remove spike noise and ﬂ atten the xy plane , respectively . Rod - like and helical structures with a uniform height of 9 . 0 6 1 . 5 nm were de ﬁ ned as helical RNPs . Pleomorphic nucleic acid - protein aggregates , except for nucleic acids ( , 2 . 5 - nm height string - like structures ) or proteins ( , 25 - nm long globular structures ) , were de ﬁ ned as abortive RNPs . Immuno - electron microscopy . Puri ﬁ ed RNPs were adsorbed onto carbon - coated nickel grids and ﬁ xed with 2 % PFA for 5 min . The grids were washed , treated with Blocking One , and then incubated with an anti - NP or anti - FLAG antibody overnight at 4°C or for 1 h at room temperature , respectively . After washing , the grids were incubated with 6 - nm gold - conjugated anti - mouse or anti - rabbit antibod - ies for 1 h at room temperature . After washing , the samples were ﬁ xed with 2 % PFA for 10 min and neg - atively stained with 2 % uranyl acetate solution . The images were acquired with an HT7700 transmission electron microscope ( Hitachi High - Tech Corporation , Tokyo , Japan ) . RT - PCR . Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy minikit with on - column DNase digestion ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) . Samples ( 10 ng ) of the extracted RNA samples were reverse transcribed using a Uni - 12 primer ( 5 9 - AGCRAAAGCAGG - 3 9 ) and Superscript III reverse transcriptase ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) . Then , 10 - fold - diluted cDNAs were PCR ampli ﬁ ed using KOD FX ( Toyobo , Osaka , Japan ) and 0 . 25 m M HA segment - speci ﬁ c primers according to the manufacturer ’ s protocol . The cycling conditions were as fol - lows : initial denaturation for 2 min at 94°C , followed by 25 cycles of 98°C for 10 s , 55°C for 30 s , and 68°C for 2 min . The PCR products were electrophoresed on 1 . 0 % agarose gels containing 0 . 01 % ( wt / vol ) ethi - dium bromide in 0 . 5 (cid:1) TBE . The primers used are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material . RT - qPCR . Two - hundred nanograms of total RNA was reverse - transcribed using Random primer 6 ( New England Biolabs ) and Superscript III reverse transcriptase . For qPCR , the reactions contained 1 m L of 10 - fold - diluted RT product , 7 . 5 m L of Thunderbird SYBR qPCR mix , and 0 . 25 m M concentrations of the primers at a ﬁ nal volume of 15 m L . The cycling conditions were as follows : initial denaturation for 2 min at 94°C , followed by 40 cycles of 98°C for 10 s , 55°C for 15 s , and 72°C for 30 s . The relative expression level of each target genes was normalized to that of GAPDH . The primers used are listed in Table S1 . A primer set for pre - rRNA , described previously ( 51 ) , was used . Strand - speci ﬁ c RT - qPCR . Strand - speci ﬁ c RT - qPCR was performed as described previously ( 52 , 53 ) . Brie ﬂ y , total RNA was extracted from cells using an RNeasy minikit . cDNAs complementary to the three types of HA genome were synthesized with tagged primers at the 5 9 end . A 2 . 5 - m L mixture containing 200 ng of total RNA sample and 20 pmol of tagged primers was heated for 10 min at 65°C , chilled imme - diately on ice for 5 min , and then reheated to 60°C . After 5 min , 7 . 5 m L of preheated reaction mixture ( 2 m L of 5 (cid:1) ﬁ rst - strand buffer , 0 . 5 m L of 0 . 1 M DTT , 0 . 5 m L of dNTP mix [ 10 mM each ] , 0 . 5 m L of Superscript III reverse transcriptase [ 200 U / m L ] , 0 . 25 m L of RNasin Plus RNase inhibitor [ 40 U / m L , Promega ] , and 3 . 75 m L of saturated trehalose ) was added , followed by incubation at 60°C for 1 h . For the qPCR , each 15 - m L reaction contained 1 m L of 50 - fold - diluted RT product , 7 . 5 m L of Thunderbird SYBR qPCR mix , and 0 . 25 m M concentrations of primers . The cycling conditions were as follows : initial denatu - ration for 2 min at 95°C , followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s and 60°C for 45 s . Tenfold serial dilutions ( 10 9 , 10 8 , 10 7 , 10 6 , 10 5 , and 10 4 copies / m L ) of synthetic vRNA standards were used to generate a standard curve . The primers used are listed in Table S2 . Subcellular fractionation . We performed subcellular fractionation as described previously ( 54 ) and optimized the buffers , incubation time , and centrifugal force for MDCK cells . Brie ﬂ y , pelleted MDCK cells ( two 15 - cm 2 dishes ) were resuspended in ice - cold mild detergent buffer ( 20 mM Tris [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 10 mM KCl , 3 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 % NP - 40 , 10 % glycerol ) and centrifuged at 100 (cid:1) g for 5 min at 4°C . The superna - tants were further centrifuged at 1 , 400 (cid:1) g for 10 min at 4°C and collected as the cytoplasmic fraction . The pellets were then resuspended in 3 mL of 0 . 25 M sucrose / 10 mM MgCl 2 , layered over a 3 - mL cushion of 0 . 35 M sucrose / 3 mM MgCl 2 , and centrifuged at 1 , 400 (cid:1) g for 5 min at 4°C . The resulting cleaner nu - clear pellet was resuspended in 0 . 35 M sucrose / 3 mM MgCl 2 and sonicated six times for 10 s on ice ( 10 - s rest between pulses ) to disrupt nuclei and release nucleoli . The sonicate was layered over a 3 - mL cush - ion of 0 . 88 M sucrose / 3 mM MgCl 2 and centrifuged at 2 , 800 (cid:1) g for 10 min at 4°C to pellet the nucleoli , and the supernatant was collected as the nucleoplasmic fraction . All solutions used in the fractionation were supplemented with cOmplete EDTA - free protease inhibitor to minimize protein degradation . The nucleoli were washed by resuspension in 0 . 5 mL of 0 . 35 M sucrose / 3 mM MgCl 2 , followed by centrifugation at 2 , 800 (cid:1) g for 5 min at 4°C . The nucleolar pellet was resuspended in 300 m L of middle - salt RIPA buffer ( 50 mM Tris [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 300 mM NaCl , 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 5 % deoxycholate , cOmplete EDTA - free protease inhibitor ) containing 16 m L of 1 - U / m L RQ1 RNase - free DNase and rotated for 30 min at 4°C . The lysate was centrifuged at 20 , 000 (cid:1) g for 10 min at 4°C , the supernatant was collected as the nucleolar Role of Nucleolus in In ﬂ uenza Virus RNP Formation ® January / February 2022 Volume 13 Issue 1 e03315 - 21 mbio . asm . org 11 extract , and the NaCl concentration was adjusted to 150 mM by adding 300 m L of “ no salt ” RIPA buffer ( 50 mM Tris [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 5 % deoxycholate , EDTA - free complete protease inhibitor ) .
