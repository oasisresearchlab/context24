ORIGINAL EMPIRICAL RESEARCH When less is more : the downside of customer knowledge sharing in new product development teams Yihui ( Elina ) Tang 1 & Detelina Marinova 2 Received : 18 July 2017 / Accepted : 20 March 2019 / Published online : 13 June 2019 # Academy of Marketing Science 2019 Abstract Despite the common belief that knowledge sharing in new product development ( NPD ) teams is beneficial , empirical findings are mixed . We adopt a microfoundations perspective and draw from the socio - cognitive theory to propose a model that theorizes a nonlinear effect of customer knowledge sharing behaviors on NPD performance . In particular , we identify the underlying mechanism through which shared common customer knowledge and perceived diagnostic value shape the nonlinear returns to customer knowledge sharing behaviors . In Study 1 , data from the biotechnology industry provide support for the hypothesis that customer knowledge sharing behaviors in NPD teams have an inverted U - shaped relationship with NPD performance . In Study 2 , data from business - to - business ( B2B ) industries demonstrate that customer knowledge sharing behaviors are positively related to shared common customer knowledge in NPD teams , and the latter has an inverted U - shaped effect on NPD performance . Finally , this nonlinear effect is moderated by the team ’ s perceived diagnostic value of customer knowledge , such that the inflection point of the inverted U - shaped curve is shifted upward in teams with high levels of perceived diagnostic value of customer knowledge , strengthening the impact of shared common knowledge on NPD performance .

Diagnostic A plethora of examples highlight the benefits of knowledge sharing for innovation efforts . At Boeing , knowledge sharing in new product development ( NPD ) teams was essential to the success of Dreamliner 787 , a revolutionary jetliner ( Leonard et al . 2014 ) . At ARM Holdings , where over 95 % of the world ’ s smartphones and tablets obtain their microprocessors , superior innovation follows the purposeful elimination of knowledge sharing barriers ( Velu 2015 ) . It is estimated that Fortune 500 companies lose roughly “ $ 31 . 5 billion a year by failing to share knowledge ” ( Quast 2012 , p . 46 ) . Consider Nokia ’ s rise and fall in the past decade : During its effort to develop the next smartphone , different departments shared little knowledge with each other . This led to slower develop - ment and the failure to keep up with companies like Apple and Google . Thus , Nokia went from having 49 % of the smartphone market in 2007 to completely exiting this market in 2013 ( Bloomberg 2013 ; Vuori and Huy 2016 ) . But is it really safe to assume “ the more , the better ” when it comes to knowledge sharing ? Despite the large body of re - search on the benefits of knowledge sharing , researchers do not always observe its positive impact on team success ( Choi et al . 2010 ; Zhou and Li 2012 ) . A meta - analysis of NPD performance drivers indicates that knowledge sharing in NPD teams does not necessarily lead to new product success ( Henard and Szymanski 2001 ) . Relatedly , in another meta - analysis on information sharing in teams , Mesmer - Magnus and DeChurch ( 2009 ) offer evidence that more communica - tive teams may be less effective . Furthermore , controlled ex - periments in small group research reveal that people produce fewer and less creative ideas when they talk to others in a Stefan Wuyts served as Area Editor for this article .

Other studies have found highly communica - tive groups to be less productive ( Stroebe et al . 2010 ) , which re - affirms Mullen et al . ’ s ( 1991 , p . 18 ) meta - analysis conclu - sion that “ productivity loss in brainstorming groups is highly significant . ” Even though many studies have focused on the positive impact of in - team knowledge sharing , some empirical studies have reported non - significant effects on NPD performance ( Sethi 2000a ) , new product quality ( Keller 2001 ) , and NPD project budget performance ( Keller 2001 ) . There are inconsistent findings regarding the impact of NPD team knowledge sharing on perfor - mance outcomes such as team efficiency , with some reporting no effect ( Park et al . 2009 ) but others reporting a positive effect ( Markham and Lee 2014 ) . To shed light on this , we address the following research questions : ( 1 ) How do customer knowledge sharing behaviors in business - to - business ( B2B ) NPD teams impact NPD per - formance ? ( 2 ) What is the underlying socio - cognitive mecha - nism for this impact ? We offer four main contributions . First , we conceptualize and provide evidence for a nonlinear effect of customer knowledge sharing behaviors on NPD perfor - mance . Despite emerging evidence from practice , prior re - search has ignored nonlinear effects and examined only linear relationships between knowledge sharing and innovation suc - cess ( Table 1 ) . If the relationship is non - monotonic , as we argue in this research , then a model assuming a linear effect is misspecified and cannot uncover the true association . Instead , it will result in an averaging of the positive and neg - ative effects , or the positive effects dominating the negative , or vice versa , over different ranges of data . Second , drawing from the socio - cognitive theory ( Bandura 1978 , 1999 ) , we demonstrate that shared common customer knowledge in the team is an underlying nonlinear mediation mechanism through which individual team members ’ custom - er knowledge sharing behaviors impact NPD performance . In particular , we argue and show that shared common customer knowledge has an inverted U - shaped effect on NPD perfor - mance . This nonlinear effect is also moderated by the team ’ s perceived diagnostic value of customer knowledge , such that the inflection point of the inverted U - shaped effect is shifted upward in teams with high levels of perceived diagnostic val - ue of customer knowledge , strengthening the impact of shared common knowledge on NPD performance . There has been a lack of research clarity regarding the underlying mechanism through which knowledge sharing impacts innovation success ( Table 1 ) . In particular , prior work has not investigated or identified the associated socio - cognitive mechanism . Yet , re - lated research shows that cognitively - rooted constructs add explanatory power to team functioning and performance models ( DeChurch and Mesmer - Magnus 2010 ; Salas et al . 2012 ) . Adopting a microfoundations perspective ( Barney and Felin 2013 ; Foss and Pedersen 2016 ) , our research fills this gap , recognizing that managing socio - cognitive dynamics can be more cost and time efficient than managing organiza - tional dynamics such as team restructuring ( Boles 1999 ; Olivera and Argote 1999 ) . Third , our research systematically investigates the impact of customer knowledge sharing on NPD success . Prior NPD research has primarily focused on the sharing of technical knowledge ( see Tables 1 and 2 ) , whereas customer knowledge development in NPD teams is a “ key prerequisite for new product success ” ( Joshi and Sharma 2004 , p . 47 ) and consti - tutes “ a cornerstone of the marketing concept ” ( Homburg et al . 2009 , p . 64 ) . The current research addresses this gap . Fourth , this paper adds to the sparse empirical literature on NPD teams in B2B industries ( Table 1 ) . Both innovation and B2B researchers identify B2B NPD as a top research priority ( Griffin et al . 2013 ; Lilien 2016 ) . A recent meta - analysis found that , compared to customers in the business - to - consumer ( B2C ) market , business customers possess more reliable and relevant knowledge , and are more motivated to share their knowledge with the NPD team ( Chang and Taylor Table 1 Summary of prior research on knowledge sharing in NPD teams Type of market Type of knowledge Knowledge sharing consequence Knowledge sharing mechanism B2C Customer knowledge None None Project relevant knowledge Li and Calantone ( 1998 ) a ; Sethi ( 2000a ) ; Song et al .

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows . First , we discuss the literature and relevant research background , followed by the proposed theoretical framework . Next , we present an overview of two empirical studies , followed by the details and results of each study . The paper concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and managerial implications as well as limitations and avenues for future research . Research background Microfoundations research The microfoundations perspective ( Foss and Pedersen 2016 ) posits that “ micro - level ” interactions of individuals within a work unit have “ macro - level ” performance outcomes , and has produced empirical evidence with important contributions to the areas of firm - level performance ( Eisenhardt et al . 2010 ) , knowledge processes ( Reinholt et al . 2011 ) , absorptive capac - ity ( Lewin et al . 2011 ) , innovation ( Grigoriou and Rothaermel 2014 ) , and organizational capabilities ( Kemper et al . 2013 ) . More recently , it has led to a better understanding of how managerial cognitions and interactions lead to firm - level out - comes ( Barney and Felin 2013 ; Greve 2013 ) . The fundamen - tal idea is to decompose macro - level constructs in terms of the actions and interactions of lower level organizational mem - bers , in order to gain an understanding of how higher level performance emerges from such interactions . Thus , microfoundations are about locating the proximate cause of a phenomenon ( i . e . , the explanation of an outcome ) at levels of analysis lower than that of the phenomenon itself ( Felin and Hesterly 2007 ) . The main issue of interest is social aggrega - tion , or the micro – macro link in group and organizational settings ( Barney and Felin 2013 ) . In NPD teams , individual members combine their cognitive and behavioral resources to complete team tasks and achieve team - level performance out - comes . Yet , there is a lack of microfoundations research on team decision making ( Helfat and Peteraf 2015 ) and , despite recent calls for research , it has received little attention in the NPD literature ( Grant 1996 ; Teece 2007 ) . Since our research aims to understand how socio - cognitive processes in NPD teams , i . e . , how individual - level knowledge sharing behaviors impact team - level outcomes , a microfoundations perspective constitutes a suitable and promising approach . Within this perspective , a particularly useful theory for the proposed work is the socio - cognitive theory , which we discuss next . Socio - cognitive theory The socio - cognitive process is undoubtedly an essential com - ponent of group functioning . Small group research suggests that “ studying group performance requires an analysis of the sociocognitive processes within the group ” ( Van den Bossche et al . 2006 , p . 492 , emphasis added ) . However , it has been noted that “ it is somewhat surprising that traditional motiva - tion theories such as expectancy theory and socio - cognitive theory have not been used as often in knowledge sharing research . Future research should investigate knowledge shar - ing using these theoretical frameworks ” ( Wang and Noe 2010 , p . 123 ) . Responding to this call for knowledge sharing re - search using the socio - cognitive theory , we examine how the process of NPD team members sharing knowledge with each other is related to mutually shared cognitions in the team , and the implications on NPD team performance . Socio - cognitive theory posits that behaviors , cognitions , and environmental influences act as interacting determinants of learning , motivation , and innovative work behaviors ( Bandura 1999 ; Bandura 2011 ; Stajkovic and Luthans 2003 ) . Thus , learning and cognitions ( e . g . , beliefs , expectations ) are viewed as contextually embedded within a social environment ( Fiore 2012 ) . Though rarely used to study knowledge sharing in NPD , socio - cognitive theory has been used to study the relationship between team cognition and managerial behavior ( e . g . , DeChurch and Mesmer - Magnus 2010 ; Pearsall et al . 2010 ) . Shared knowledge in a team is recognized as a cognition component that “ helps team members understand and adapt to their environment and provides a common interpretative frame - work for their experiences ” ( Levine and Moreland 1999 , p . 269 ) . White ( 1992 ) considers information sharing the “ nervous system ” that allows organization unit members to coordinate their work efforts and create a social environment that may stimulate creative performance . Shared cognitions are especial - ly important when the group task is complex and requires a high degree of response coordination ( Levine and Moreland 1999 ) , which is a defining characteristic of NPD project teams . Group members can acquire both task and social knowledge through their interaction ( Olivera and Argote 1999 ) . Knowledge sharing of NPD team members includes be - haviors that occur in the social environment of the team as well as within the broader market environment , where infor - mation about customers and competitors can continually shape the team ’ s shared cognition . As behavior , cognition , and environment influence one another , knowledge sharing behaviors can sway the shared cognition of the team . The market environment can affect the team ’ s cognition or beliefs about the importance of customer knowledge . If a team be - lieves that utilizing a particular type of knowledge in decision making will be beneficial for its performance , then its mem - bers are more likely to use it in decision making . Definitions We define customer knowledge sharing behaviors as the com - munication process associated with NPD team members ’ J . of the Acad . Mark . Sci . ( 2020 ) 48 : 288 – 307 291 provisioning and exchanging projected - related customer in - formation and knowledge with other members in the same team . Here , customer knowledge refers to the knowledge about customer ’ s needs , preferences , and behaviors . Firms with a superior understanding of their customers can deploy available resources in ways that more closely match target customer requirements , and thus deliver superior customer value ( Hunt and Morgan 1995 ; Slater and Narver 1998 ) . We focus on customer knowledge because possessing and utiliz - ing such knowledge is especially important in innovation ac - tivities and critical for NPD success ( De Luca and Atuahene - Gima 2007 ) . The NPD process often involves unanticipated changes and challenges , making it important to understand and collect timely feedback from customers ( Eisenhardt and Tabrizi 1995 ; Olivera and Argote 1999 ) . Further , we adopt a socio - cognitive view to conceptualize shared knowledge in a team as cognitive development that results from the social , interpersonal interaction among team members . Grant ( 1996 , p . 115 ) noted that , “ At its most simple , common knowledge comprises those elements of knowledge common to all organizational members : the intersection of their individual knowledge sets . ” Based on this , we conceptu - alize shared common customer knowledge as project - related customer knowledge that is commonly held by team members of an NPD team , i . e . , the intersection of their individual knowledge sets about the customers . Customer knowledge sharing behaviors and shared com - mon customer knowledge are related but distinct constructs . The former is a social , behavioral process at the individual level , whereas the latter is a socio - cognitive state , reflecting team cognition , and an outcome at the team level . Thus , it is appropriate to study knowledge sharing as an individually exhibited behavior , at the individual level , and shared com - mon customer knowledge , at the collective or team level ( Cooke et al . 2009 ; Gorman et al . 2010 ) . Hypotheses development Individual customer knowledge sharing behaviors and NPD performance Drawing from the microfoundations perspective , we investi - gate the question of how NPD team members ’ individual be - havior can scale to a team - level outcome . We propose that customer knowledge sharing behaviors in an NPD team exert an inverted U - shaped effect on NPD performance , such that NPD performance increases when team members first engage in customer knowledge sharing , but only up to a certain level , after which the effects level off and even start to hurt NPD performance . Abundant research touts the performance impacts of general knowledge sharing in NPD , including the positive effects on innovation performance ( De Luca and Atuahene - Gima 2007 ; Liu et al . 2015a ) , product success ( Ayers et al . 1997 ) , the number of new product ideas generated ( Troy et al . 2001 ) , product quality ( Sethi 2000b ) , product innovativeness ( Park et al . 2009 ) , team effectiveness ( Ayers et al . 1997 ) , and overall team and project performance ( Ernst et al . 2010 ; Hoegl et al . 2004 ; Marinova 2004 ; Markham and Lee 2014 ; Moorman 1995 ) ( Table 2 ) . The latter studies point to several reasons for the positive effect of knowledge sharing behaviors on NPD performance . First , when team members start to share knowledge , rich opportunities emerge for novel combinations of complementary knowledge , promoting a more holistic pic - ture of the market ( Joshi and Sharma 2004 ; Srivastava et al . 2006 ) . Second , knowledge sharing helps individual team members to better process and use their existing knowledge ( Harvey and Fischer 1997 ) , including to connect and integrate disparate knowledge to achieve better product innovation per - formance ( De Luca and Atuahene - Gima 2007 ) . Third , the act of knowledge sharing can also generate new knowledge , which , when shared in the team , can lead to creative NPD outcomes ( Zhou and Li 2012 ) . In summary , through knowl - edge sharing , team members can obtain a more holistic shared understanding of the customers and achieve a better market sense - making capability . Subsequently , improved decision making and quick adaptation to market changes can be expected . On the other hand , drawing from socio - cognitive theory , we argue that too much knowledge sharing can hurt NPD performance . The act of knowledge sharing yields a flow of complex information that is shared in a team , but the inherent noise accompanying the communication process can over - shadow the signal ( Day and Schoemaker 2004 ; Velu 2015 ) . Interactions within a group have been found to have both cognitive stimulation and interference effects on group perfor - mance ( Kerr et al . 1996 ; Nijstad and Stroebe 2006 ) . Thus , a meta - analysis reveals significant productivity loss in highly interactive groups such as brainstorming groups ( Mullen et al . 1991 ) , an “ unintended yet inevitable consequence of communication in verbally interacting groups ” ( Nijstad and Stroebe 2006 , p . 200 ) . Extensive sharing behavior is thought to disrupt cognitive processes such as information retrieval and ideation . Cognitive overload , propagated by group mem - bers ’ divided attention between listening , processing large amount of shared information , and speaking , impedes group performance ( Diehl and Stroebe 1991 ) . Consistent with this , research on communication in teams indicates that too much information sharing can overload team members ’ information processing capacities , which can then inhibit team perfor - mance ( Levine and Moreland 1999 ; Wegner 1987 ) . In summary , through customer knowledge sharing , the NPD team gains a better shared or collective understanding of the customers . Thus , it can better adapt the new product design to the challenges and opportunities in the marketplace . 292 J . of the Acad . Mark . Sci . ( 2020 ) 48 : 288 – 307 However , for reasons stated above , too much sharing can ac - tually negatively impact team productivity and hurt NPD performance . H1 : Individual NPD team members ’ customer knowledge sharing behaviors exhibit a curvilinear relationship with NPD performance , following an inverted U - shaped pattern . The mediating role of shared common customer knowledge We propose that shared common customer knowledge in the NPD team mediates the effect of customer knowledge sharing behaviors on NPD performance . One main benefit of knowl - edge sharing derives from meshing diverse knowledge from different individuals ( Grant 1996 ) . The communication pro - cess of team members sharing knowledge with each other can be seen as a means to and a facilitator of shared common knowledge in the team ( Nelson and Cooprider 1996 ) . When individual team members share their customer knowledge with each other , “ through the exchange of initially unshared information ” ( Gigone and Hastie 1993 , p . 959 ) , the team reaches some shared common understanding of the customers . The more individual team members share knowledge with each other , the greater the extent of shared common knowledge . From a social cognitive point of view , the NPD team , and the broader market environment , are the social environment that individual team members operate in , and cognition is contextually embedded within the social environment ( Fiore 2012 ) . Thus , even though the behavior of sharing customer knowledge occurs at the individual level , the resulting shared common customer knowledge resides at the team level . Differential team performance can be better understood by examining not only behavioral interactions among team mem - bers , but also the team ’ s shared cognition ( Cooke et al . 2009 ; Gorman et al . 2010 ) . In line with this view and prior research ( Alavi and Leidner 2001 ; Faraj et al . 2011 ) , we consider shared common customer knowledge as an important team - level construct that results from team members ’ interactions . H2 : Individual team members ’ customer knowledge sharing behaviors have a positive effect on the level of shared common customer knowledge within the NPD team . Social psychologists have studied shared common knowl - edge as a factor that influences group decisions and outcomes . In his seminal work , Grant ( 1996 , p . 115 ) notes that “ the im - portance of common knowledge is that it permits individuals to share and integrate aspects of knowledge which are not common between them . ” Organizational behavior research has also found that some redundant or shared knowledge among different organizational members is necessary for in - dividuals to cross functional boundaries and understand each other ( Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995 ) . Similarly , in a team context , scholars have found that “ shared knowledge … helps group members understand and adapt to their environment and provides a common interpre - tative framework for their experiences ” ( Levine and Moreland 1999 , p . 269 ) . Shared knowledge provides a common plat - form for team communication . It enables team members to better understand the context of new and old information , or beliefs and suggestions from others on the team . This reduces misunderstanding and the cost of explaining things to one another , therefore making the group decision process as well as the actual “ doing ” part of the job more efficient . Strategy research reveals that some shared common knowledge helps individuals in a team reach consistent and cohesive views of team - level goals , and it generates more relevant insights re - garding the team ’ s future actions ( Turner and Makhija 2012 ) . A shared knowledge base leads to better coordination of team efforts and improved team effectiveness ( Srivastava et al . 2006 ) , as well as an enhanced ability for team members to work toward a common goal ( Nelson and Cooprider 1996 ) . However , there is a dark or paradoxical side of shared com - mon knowledge in an NPD team ( Grant 1996 ) . While a low level of overlapping knowledge impedes mutual understand - ing due to the lack of common ground , a high level of over - lapping knowledge diminishes the gain from having one an - other . Consistent with this , social cognitive research has found that “ maximally shared information can inhibit group perfor - mance ” despite its benefit of cognitive “ requisite variety ” ( Levine and Moreland 1999 , p . 287 ) , and thus too much shared common knowledge in a team can become dysfunctional . There are several reasons for this detrimental effect . First , team members ’ interpretations become less effective as the information to be interpreted begins to exceed the team ’ s ca - pacity to process it ( Huber 1991 ; Nijstad and Stroebe 2006 ) . In fact , it has been found that extensive amounts of shared knowledge in NPD teams can cause attention allocation prob - lems ( Laursen and Salter 2006 ) , as the sheer volume of infor - mation makes it challenging for team members to sort , filter , and identify relevant knowledge . Second , research on majority influence suggests that shared information and opinions can produce pressure toward unifor - mity , which reduces team members ’ attention to novel alter - natives and in turn leads to poor decisions ( Levine and Moreland 1999 ; Levine and Thompson 1996 ) . As the extent of shared knowledge increases , team members are likely to perceive a group consensus . The motivation to fit in and avoid deviance from the majority group will hamper their ability to elaborate and process information effectively ( Cialdini and Goldstein 2004 ; Erb et al . 2002 ) . In addition , individuals J . of the Acad . Mark . Sci . ( 2020 ) 48 : 288 – 307 293 may use an accuracy heuristic that favors the majority instead of fully analyzing the information ( Cialdini and Goldstein 2004 ) , and the critical evaluation of assumptions among team members is less thorough ( Kratzer et al . 2004 ; Nicholas 1994 ) . As a result , they are more receptive to the position endorsed by the majority and are likely to place greater value on shared rather than on unshared information ( Cialdini and Goldstein 2004 ) . Third , the common - knowledge effect suggests that over - lapping or shared information is weighed more heavily than unshared information in decision - making ( Gigone and Hastie 1993 ) . Shared information is seen as more reliable , and hence it exerts more informational influence . The tendency of teams to discuss and attend to shared rather than unshared informa - tion increases with higher overall information load , such that teams fail to make use of all of their individual , idiosyncratic informational resources ( Argote et al . 2003 ; Stasser and Titus 1985 ) . Past a certain point , more shared common knowledge reduces the unique contribution of each individual team mem - ber , thus harming creativity . Indeed , Moorman and Miner ( 1997 ) find that , at times , higher levels of shared understand - ing and homogeneous knowledge in NPD teams can detract from creativity . H3 : Shared common customer knowledge in an NPD team exerts an inverted U - shaped effect on NPD performance . The moderating role of the perceived diagnostic value of customer knowledge We define an NPD team ’ s perceived diagnostic value of customer knowledge as the extent to which the team be - lieves that decisions based on customer knowledge will lead to specific NPD performance outcomes in a clear cause - and - effect relationship ( Levitt and March 1988 ) . Beliefs about the cause - and - effect relationship are “ partic - ularly important in supporting strategic decision making since they serve as the basis on which decision markers infer the consequence of their actions ” ( Gary and Wood 2011 , p . 570 ) . In particular , managerial knowledge struc - tures that define what does and does not “ work ” provide a framework for team members to interpret information from the market environment , and to make inferences about their actions ( Ansoff and McDonnell 1984 ) . Diagnostic information “ provides a heuristic for filter - ing the vast amounts of potentially relevant information ” ( Harmeling et al . 2017 , p . 4 ) . In innovation contexts , rap - id changes and the dynamic market environment require NPD teams to quickly recognize important new informa - tion and to understand the cause - and - effect linkages be - tween decisions based on certain information and their outcomes ( Kozlowski et al . 1999 ; Randall et al . 2011 ) . Time pressure , which is inherently present during NPD , also induces decision makers to focus on salient , diagnos - tic information . We argue that an NPD team ’ s perceived diagnostic value of customer knowledge can be viewed as a cognitive force that guides the team ’ s utilization of cus - tomer knowledge in team decision making . Socio - cognitive theory acknowledges that “ environmental influences partly determine what people attend to , perceive , and think ” ( Bandura 1978 , pp . 344 – 345 ) . Strategy scholars have found that the allocation of scarce managerial attention to the most relevant issues is required for effective strategic decision - making ( March and Shapira 1987 ) . During the NPD process , team members form an attention filter through which information is considered and processed . Only information that passes through this filter can be utilized for team decision making ( Kelly and Karau 1999 ) . If teams do not see the link - ages between customer knowledge , actions based on such knowledge , and the subsequent performance outcome , then they are less likely to use their shared common customer knowledge in decision making , thus failing to benefit from it . On the other hand , teams with a high perceived diagnostic value of customer knowledge recognize that comprehensive and up - to - date customer knowledge is critical for NPD suc - cess . Therefore , they are likely to allocate more managerial attention to customer knowledge because their pre - set cogni - tive filter makes the screening of such information automatic . Such information would easily surface during team decision making . Subsequently , the team is more likely to recognize and quickly respond to the latest market changes , achieving superior performance . Overall , the social cognitive perspective maintains that all group processes are understandable through an analysis of how group members process group - relevant information ( Pryor and Ostrom 1987 ) . Behavioral decisions are influenced by one ’ s belief of what outcome will result from a particular behavior . This has also been extended theoretically to collec - tive behavioral decisions in groups ( Bandura 2001 ) . In the context of NPD , if a team holds the belief that customer knowledge is consequential for team performance , the prob - lem of filtering large amounts of incoming knowledge is alle - viated ; hence , team members are more likely to allocate atten - tion to and utilize their shared customer knowledge in decision making . Consequently , teams with high levels of perceived diagnostic value of customer knowledge will experience a more positive effect of shared common customer knowledge on NPD performance ; the inverted U - shaped curve , as pro - posed in H3 , will move upward . H4 : The perceived diagnostic value of customer knowledge in an NPD team moderates the curvilinear relationship between shared common customer knowledge and NPD performance such that the inflection point of the inverted U - shaped effect is shifted upward in teams with 294 J . of the Acad . Mark . Sci . ( 2020 ) 48 : 288 – 307 high levels of perceived diagnostic value of customer knowledge , strengthening the impact of shared common knowledge on NPD performance . The conceptual framework , presented in Fig . 1 , is tested with two studies in different industries . In Study 1 , we test and establish the nonlinear effect of customer knowledge sharing behaviors on NPD performance in a biotechnology industry setting . In Study 2 , we utilize a field survey in the shipbuild - ing , railroad , and design engineering industries to shed light on the mechanism through which customer knowledge shar - ing behaviors impact NPD performance . Study 1 : Impact of customer knowledge sharing behaviors on NPD performance Research setting and design To test H1 , we sought an industry in which NPD team members regularly communicate and collectively process knowledge to make joint innovation decisions . The bio - tech industry is a knowledge - intensive industry in which NPD is critical to organizational survival and success . Most biotech firms simultaneously develop multiple new products , and distribute tasks and responsibilities across many NPD teams . Such a structure helps distribute and decrease the risk inherent to innovation . We conducted a field survey of two U . S . biotech firms with operations in the United States , Europe , and Asia . They both develop , manufacture , and market biological and chemical equipment and reagents . Each NPD team focuses on develop - ing one new product , with significant autonomy . Team mem - bers work together , make joint decisions , and are held ac - countable for their team ’ s performance . Our research ap - proach involves a survey of team members ( to assess the extent of knowledge sharing behaviors ) and a survey of team leaders ( to collect team performance measures ) , following Dillman et al . ( 2014 ) . We first consulted industry experts and examined secondary data to understand the NPD process in this industry . Then , we conducted seven in - depth qualita - tive interviews with NPD managers from the focal firms , each lasting 60 – 120 min . In turn , we developed the initial survey instrument and pretested it to verify its relevance , clarity , and completeness . The survey was revised until we confirmed the content and face validity of all the measures . The survey in - troduction emphasized that “ all questions below are regarding NPD team x and your interaction with team members in this team . ” NPD team leaders were asked to provide NPD perfor - mance measures for the particular product developed by the team . This finalized questionnaire was administered using Qualtrics software . Top management in both firms sent emails to 247 qualified respondents in 20 NPD teams , encouraging them to participate during work hours . As an incentive , we offered the firms a summary of the research findings ; also , individual participants were entered into a lottery to win one of 10 gift cards to Target worth either $ 50 or $ 100 . We ulti - mately collected data from 182 respondents from 20 NPD teams , for a 74 % response rate . The average team size was 10 , ranging from 4 to 22 members . Measurement To measure the behavior of customer knowledge sharing ( KNScust ) , we adapted a reflective knowledge sharing scale from Cummings ( 2004 ) , such that each respondent indicated how often he or she shared project - related customer knowl - edge with others in the NPD team , in response to the question , “ On average , how often did you share project - related knowl - edge regarding the following issues with your team mem - bers ? ” For NPD performance , we adopted a scale from Moorman ( 1995 ) , with items such as : “ Relative to our firm ’ s Fig . 1 Conceptual framework J . of the Acad . Mark . Sci . ( 2020 ) 48 : 288 – 307 295 Customer Knowledge Sharing Behaviors Shared Common Customer Knowledge NPD Performance Perceived Diagnostic Value of Customer Knowledge H1 Level 1 : Individual Level Level 2 : Team Level H4 + Control variables : • Competitor knowledge sharing behaviors (cid:129) Shared common competitor knowledge (cid:129) Communications (cid:129) Customer participation (cid:129) Budget efficiency (cid:129) Difference from a typical project other new products , this product is very successful in terms of sales . ” NPD team leaders answered these questions . We ex - amined the consistency of the reported performance measures in teams with two leaders and found a high level of agreement ( α = . 941 ) . Three variables provided controls in the model . First , a frequency of communications ( COMU ) scale measured how often team members engaged with others in the team . Second , we controlled for the perception of team performance with two items as shown in Web Appendix A . Third , we controlled for the behavior of competitor knowledge sharing ( KNScomp ) with three items as shown in Web Appendix A . A confirmatory factor analysis ( CFA ) to assess the conver - gent and discriminant validity of the measures explicitly fo - cused on the study constructs . That is , items corresponding to the key constructs were analyzed in a CFA using EQS . 6 . 2 for Windows , and constrained to load on their hypothesized fac - tors . We provide the results in Web Appendix A . The estimat - ed factor loadings and covariances then provided the input to assess the convergent and discriminant validity . The measure - ment model fit the data well ( Bollen ’ s fit index = . 930 , com - parative fit index = . 931 , and root mean squared error of ap - proximation = . 070 ) . The average variance extracted ( AVE ) values were higher than . 50 and greater than the shared variance among constructs , and the reliability es - timates were robust ( . 813 ) , exceeding the . 700 threshold . In terms of discriminant validity , in accordance with Fornell and Larcker ( 1981 ) , the AVE exceeded the max - imum shared variance . We also estimated a CFA in which we constrained the correlation between KNScust and KNScomp to 1 , which offered a significantly different fit than the unconstrained model , in further support of the discrimi - nant validity ( Anderson and Gerbing 1988 ) . Empirical analysis and results To account for the nested nature of the data — that is , team members are nested within teams — we estimated a random parameters model ( Greene 2012 ) . The unobserved heteroge - neity across team members can be addressed with the random parameters . Thus , we ran a model with NPD performance as the dependent variable , linear and quadratic terms of customer knowledge sharing behaviors ( KNScust ) as the independent variables , and frequency of communications ( COMU ) , per - ceived team performance , and competitor knowledge sharing behaviors ( KNScomp ) as the control variables . The log likeli - hood function of the hypothesized model is − 29 . 79 , and of the model with only the control variables is − 123 . 34 . The likeli - hood ratio test confirms that the hypothesized models fit better than the models with just the control variables ( χ 23df = 93 . 55 , p < . 001 ) , with a pseudo R 2 of . 41 . Descriptive statistics and correlations are reported in Web Appendix B . The results of the model tests are presented in Table 3 . The VIFs are uniformly under 5 , and thus multicollinearity is not a concern . Consistent with H1 , the quadratic term of customer knowledge shar - ing behaviors has a negative impact on NPD performance ( − . 041 , p = . 003 ) , while the effect of the linear term is positive ( . 149 , p = . 032 ) . Thus , the overall effect is non - linear in the shape of an inverted U , supporting H1 . The diminishing benefits of customer knowledge sharing be - haviors on NPD performance contradict prior scholarly and managerial practices , which generally support “ the more , the better ” perspective by assuming that knowledge sharing behavior is , in and of itself , beneficial for NPD performance . Our findings indicate that the impact of cus - tomer knowledge sharing behaviors on NPD performance is the strongest when the extent of knowledge sharing is moderate rather than high or absent . Study 2 : The role of shared common customer knowledge and perceived diagnostic value of customer knowledge Research setting and design Study 1 established the nonlinear effect of customer knowl - edge sharing behaviors on NPD performance . In Study 2 , we examine an underlying mechanism for this effect and test the proposed framework across different industries . We conducted a field survey of NPD teams across three companies in the shipbuilding , railroad , and design engineer - ing industries in China . Each NPD team in the study focuses on developing one new product , with significant autonomy . Team members are held accountable for their team ’ s perfor - mance , and the performance of each project is relatively inde - pendent of the other teams . As in Study 1 , our research ap - proach involved a survey of NPD team members and a survey of team leaders . We first conducted interviews with industry experts , as well as executives and NPD team leaders from the focal firms . These early interviews , which lasted approximate - ly fifteen hours in total , helped us understand the research context and were instrumental in our attempts to craft the pretest survey . On the basis of these interviews , we developed prelim - inary versions of the questionnaires . We initially devel - oped the questionnaire in English , then used the standard forward - and backward - translation procedure to translate it into Chinese ( Brislin 1990 , also see Menguc et al . 2016 , Wang et al . 2017 ) . This ensured that the English and Chinese versions contained identical measures . We pretested the questionnaires and subsequently made two rounds of revisions to ensure the clarity of the instructions and the appropriateness of the used terminology . The sur - vey introduction emphasizes that “ all questions below are 296 J . of the Acad . Mark . Sci . ( 2020 ) 48 : 288 – 307 regarding NPD team x and your interaction with team members in this team . ” NPD team members were asked to assess the extent of individual knowledge sharing be - haviors and shared common knowledge in the team . Team leaders were asked to evaluate NPD performance , per - ceived diagnostic value of customer knowledge in the team , and project characteristics for the particular project . The finalized questionnaire was administered by the firm at internal business meetings as an anonymous survey . Altogether , data were collected from 377 respondents from 79 NPD teams , including 298 team members and 79 team leaders . The average team size was 5 , ranging from 3 to 13 members . Measurement Both the customer knowledge sharing behaviors and shared common customer knowledge were measured with reflective items . Measurement items for customer knowledge sharing behaviors ( KNScust ) were the same as in Study 1 , such that each respondent indicated how often he or she shared project - related customer knowledge with others in the NPD team , on a scale of 1 to 5 , where : 1 = “ Once Every Few Weeks ” , 2 = “ Once a Week ” , 3 = “ Several Times a Week ” , 4 = “ Daily ” , and 5 = “ Several Times a Day . ” To measure shared common cus - tomer knowledge , we asked NPD team members to rate the extent of common or overlapping project - related knowledge in the team in various aspects as related to customer knowl - edge ( SKNcust ) . Throughout the survey , respondents were reminded that the items aim to measure knowledge sharing or shared knowledge regarding a specific NPD team project . For the perceived diagnostic value of customer knowledge ( DIAG ) , each team leader was instructed to divide 100 points among three project - related knowledge categories to indicate , based on the particular team ’ s perception , how influential knowledge in the following three categories is for NPD per - formance : ( 1 ) knowledge about the customers , ( 2 ) knowledge about the competitors , and ( 3 ) technical knowledge . The points assigned to the first choice provide the data for DIAG . Following management ’ s suggestions , NPD perfor - mance is measured by new product profits ( PERF ) . For confidentiality reasons , management in each firm chose a multiplier for this measure so that the highest profit level is scaled to 7 % . This also allows the measurement to be comparable across firms . Team leaders were instructed to provide the scaled , objective financial performance of the products . The measurement came from a one - item scale that asked , “ What is the profitability of this new product development project ? ” Response options are 1 % , 2 % , 3 % , 4 % , 5 % , 6 % , and 7 % or more . As in Study 1 , we included frequency of communications ( COMU ) and competitor knowledge sharing behaviors ( KNScomp ) as control variables . The extent of shared com - mon competitor knowledge in the team ( SKNcomp ) was sim - ilarly controlled for . Based on the qualitative interviews , we also included the extent to which the project differed from a typical innovation project in the firm ( DIFF ) , customer par - ticipation ( PARTICP ) , and budget efficiency ( BUDGET ) as control variables . Customer participation was measured utiliz - ing a four - point Likert single - item measure based on Ho and Ganesan ( 2013 ) that asked for the level of agreement to the following statement : “ During the development of this product , customers or potential customers have been regularly Table 3 Study 1 results : Effects of customer knowledge sharing behaviors on NPD performance Independent variables Dependent variable : NPD performance Coefficient SE Customer knowledge sharing behaviors ( KNScust ) . 149 * . 080 Customer knowledge sharing behaviors 2 ( KNScust 2 ) Controls : − . 041 * * . 014 Competitor knowledge sharing behaviors ( KNScomp ) − . 032 . 052 Perceived team performance . 054 . 065 Communications ( COMU ) − . 019 . 031 Intercept 0 . 579 * * * 0 . 015 Log likelihood ( hypothesized model ) − 29 . 794 Log likelihood ( controls variables only ) − 123 . 339 Likelihood ratio test ( df ) 93 . 545 ( 3 ) , p < . 001 Pseudo R 2 . 410 * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 , * * * p < 0 . 001 For all the hypothesized relationships , the p value is based on one - tailed tests .

( 2020 ) 48 : 288 – 307 297 informed of and participated in providing feedback for the project . ” Budget efficiency was measured utilizing a five - point Likert single - item measure from Olson et al . ( 1995 ) that asked for the level of agreement to the following statement : “ During this project , the developmental budgets were adhered to . ” A confirmatory factor analysis ( CFA ) assessing the conver - gent and discriminant validity of the measures was conducted , and the results are provided in Web Appendix C . The mea - surement model fits the data well ( Bollen ’ s fit index = . 971 , comparative fit index = . 971 , and root mean squared error of approximation = . 058 ) . The values for the average variance extracted ( AVE ) were all higher than . 50 and greater than the shared variance among the constructs , and the reliability esti - mates were robust ( . 754 ) , exceeding the . 700 threshold . In terms of discriminant validity , in accordance with Fornell and Larcker ( 1981 ) , the AVE exceeded the maximum shared variance . We also estimated a CFA in which all the items for KNScust and KNScomp are loaded under a single factor in - stead of two factors . This model does not fit as well ( Bollen ’ s fit index = . 891 , comparative fit index = . 892 , and root mean squared error of approximation = . 083 ) . The chi - square differ - ence test shows that the difference in model fit is significant ( p < . 001 ) . In addition , we estimated a CFA where we constrained the correlation between KNScust and KNScomp to 1 , which offered a significantly different fit than the uncon - strained model . We repeated this test for every pair of con - structs , and all showed a significantly different fit than the unconstrained model , in further support of discriminant valid - ity ( Anderson and Gerbing 1988 ) . Empirical analysis and results Because team members are nested within teams , we used multilevel structural equation modeling ( MSEM ) to test the hypothesis ( Raudenbush and Bryk 2002 ) . In our conceptual model , knowledge sharing behaviors is an individual level construct , whereas shared common knowledge and NPD per - formance are team level constructs . According to Preacher et al . ( 2010 ) , this type of model is a 1 – 2 - 2 multilevel model . Specifically , knowledge sharing behaviors is specified as a level 1 predictor , shared common customer knowledge is specified as a level 2 mediator , and NPD performance is spec - ified as a level 2 outcome , with level 2 control variables . We estimated the model with the multilevel module of MPlus 8 . 0 software ( Muthén and Muthén 2017 ) , and followed the one - stage procedure developed by Preacher and col - leagues ( Preacher et al . 2010 ) to simultaneously accommodate the individual ( team member ) effects and team effects in the model . The MPlus “ TYPE = TWOLEVEL ” procedure was used to produce parameter estimates , standard errors , and test statistics in the presence of interdependency . Our company - level variation ( three companies ) was not significant to estimate a three - level multilevel model that simultaneously accounted for company - level , team - level , and individual - level variances and relationships . Therefore , following Muthén and Muthén ’ s ( 2017 ) suggestion , we used the “ CLUSTER ” and “ TYPE = COMPLEX ” MPlus syntax . With this approach , the standard errors are adjusted using a sandwich estimator to account for the nonindependence of observations resulting from cluster sampling and to correct the potential bias in estimation that may result from potential sampling differences ( Liu et al . 2015b ; Rogers 1994 ; White 1980 ) . Descriptive statistics and correlations are reported in Web Appendix B . We mean - centered all variables before entering them into the model ( Cohen et al . 2003 ; Guillaume et al . 2014 ; Yu and Zellmer - Bruhn 2018 ) . Shared common customer knowledge is a team - level construct with measurement items formulated at the team - level and data collected from individ - ual team members . Therefore , we follow Petitta et al . ’ s ( 2015 ) recommendation to aggregate responses from team members by taking the team average . Guided by Bliese ( 2000 ) , we first assessed within - group agreement r wg and two intraclass cor - relations , ICC ( 1 ) for inter - rater reliability and ICC ( 2 ) for reliability of group means , to evaluate the appropriateness of aggregating individual scores to the team level . The ICC ( 1 ) is . 82 , surpassing the recommended cutoff value of . 12 ( James 1982 ) ; the ICC ( 2 ) is . 95 and the mean r wg is . 93 , surpassing the recommended cutoff value of . 70 ( LeBreton and Senter 2008 ; Shrout and Fleiss 1979 ) . We also aggregated responses for the control variables to the team level , and found these to be statistically justifiable . The ICC ( 1 ) is . 66 . and . 61 , the ICC ( 2 ) is . 88 and . 86 , and the mean r wg value is . 92 and . 92 , for shared common competitor knowledge and communications , respectively . Table 4 provides the MSEM results for simultaneously testing all the hypotheses . The hypothesized model explains 44 . 43 % of the variance , compared to the null model that ex - plains 23 . 81 % of the variance . Customer knowledge sharing behaviors have a negative , significant quadratic ( − . 991 , p < . 001 ) effect on NPD performance , supporting H1 . Figure 2 shows this effect visually . Customer knowledge shar - ing behaviors exhibit an inverted U - shaped effect on NPD performance . The inflection point is 2 . 777 , where 2 = “ Once a Week ” , 3 = “ Several Times a Week ” , and 4 = “ Daily . ” This indicates that the optimal frequency of customer knowledge sharing within teams is several times a week , i . e . , more than once a week but less than daily . The corresponding profit is 4 . 355 % . In addition , it can be seen from Table 4 that customer knowledge sharing behaviors have a positive , significant lin - ear effect on shared common customer knowledge ( . 368 , p = . 004 ) , supporting H2 . H3 hypothesized a nonlinear effect of shared common cus - tomer knowledge on NPD performance . The results in Table 4 revealed a negative , significant quadratic effect of shared 298 J . of the Acad . Mark . Sci . ( 2020 ) 48 : 288 – 307 common customer knowledge on NPD performance ( − 1 . 184 , p = . 036 ) , lending support to H3 . To illustrate this nonlinear effect , we plotted the effects of shared common customer knowledge on NPD performance in Fig . 3 . The result is an inverted U - shaped relationship . To test the mediation effect of shared common customer knowledge , we estimated the indirect effects of customer knowledge sharing behaviors on NPD performance ( Hayes and Preacher 2010 ) . Because we used the “ TYPE = TWOLEVEL ” procedure in MPlus , MPlus generated confi - dence intervals for the indirect effect based on the asymptotic normal theory ( Muthen & Muthen , 2017 ; Petitta et al . 2015 ) . The nonlinear mediation effect coefficient , upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval , and the significance tests are shown in Table 5 . Mediation can be inferred if the con - fidence interval for the indirect effect excludes zero . As evident in Table 5 , at a low ( 20 % ) level of perceived diagnostic value of customer knowledge , the nonlinear indirect effect is not significant ( − . 065 , CI = [ − . 167 , . 036 ] ) , whereas at a medium ( 50 % ) and high ( 70 % ) level of perceived diagnostic value of customer knowledge , the nonlinear indirect effect is significant ( − . 201 , CI = [ − . 353 , − . 048 ] ; − . 268 , CI = [ − . 534 , − . 003 ] , respectively ) . Therefore , there is a mediating effect of shared common customer knowledge at a high but not at a low level of perceived diagnostic value of customer knowledge . Finally , H4 predicted that perceived diagnostic value of customer knowledge moderated the curvilinear relationship between shared common customer knowledge and NPD per - formance . Consistent with this prediction , we find a negative , significant interaction between the quadratic term of shared common customer knowledge and the perceived diagnostic value of customer knowledge ( − . 033 , p < . 001 ) , in addition to the negative , significant interaction between the linear term of shared common customer knowledge and the perceived diagnostic value of customer knowledge ( − . 034 , p < . 001 ) . To show the pattern of this interactive effect , we plotted the effects of shared common customer knowledge on NPD per - formance at low ( 20 % ) , medium ( 50 % ) , and high ( 70 % ) levels of perceived diagnostic value of customer knowledge in Fig . 3 . The result is a set of inverted U - shaped curves , which shift vertically as a function of perceived diagnostic value of cus - tomer knowledge . Visually , it is apparent that when perceived diagnostic value of knowledge is high , the inflection point of the inverted U - shaped curve is shifted upward , strengthening the impact of shared common knowledge on NPD performance .

Specifically , customer knowledge sharing behaviors is specified as a level 1 predictor , shared common customer knowledge is specified as a level 2 mediator , and NPD performance is specified as a level 2 outcome , with level 2 control variables J . of the Acad . Mark . Sci . ( 2020 ) 48 : 288 – 307 299 We further evaluated the inflection point of the curve and the corresponding profit as perceived diagnostic value of cus - tomer knowledge increases from low to high . The optimal shared common customer knowledge is 3 . 66 , 3 . 22 , and 3 . 11 , at low , medium , and high levels of perceived diagnostic value of customer knowledge , where 3 = “ Some ” and 4 = “ Quite a Bit ” . The corresponding profit is 2 . 15 % , 4 . 32 % , and 7 . 00 % , respectively . In a subset ( 72 % ) of the sampled firms , we assessed shared common knowledge with two sets of scales containing iden - tical questions but different scale labels . In the first set of scales , which is used in the survey for all firms , the labels are 1 = “ None ” , 2 = “ A Little ” , 3 = “ Some ” , 4 = “ Quite a Bit ” , and 5 = “ Extensive . ” In the second set of scales , the labels are 1 = “ 0 – 20 % ” , 2 = “ 20 – 40 % ” , 3 = “ 40 – 60 % ” , 4 = “ 60 – 80 % ” , and 5 = “ 80 – 100 % ” . Answers to the two Likert scales were highly correlated ( r = . 86 ) . Since the inflec - tion point is between 3 and 4 at any level of perceived diag - nostic value of customer knowledge , the optimal level of shared common customer knowledge in an NPD team is be - tween 40 and 60 % and 60 – 80 % , or around 60 % on average . As a robustness check , we estimated the model with an alternative dependent variable . Team leaders evaluated NPD performance with a five - point Likert scale , indicating their level of agreement to the following statement : “ Relative to our original objective , this product is very successful in terms Fig . 3 The effects of shared common customer knowledge on NPD performance in Study 2 .

Further , to address the potential endogeneity of customer knowledge sharing , we estimated an alternative MSEM model using an instrumental variable ( IV ) approach ( Germann et al . 2015 ) . We identify competitor knowledge sharing behaviors as a suitable instrumental variable because it correlates with customer knowledge sharing behaviors ( r = . 360 , p < . 001 ) but not with NPD performance ( r = − . 154 , p = . 176 ) , meeting the instrument relevance criterion and the exclusion restriction ( Angrist and Pischke 2009 ) . This enables us to partition the variation of NPD performance into that which can be ex - plained by customer knowledge sharing behaviors , and that “ which is contaminated and could result in an endogeneity bias ” ( Rossi 2014 , p . 655 ) . We estimated the MSEM model with this IV , and the results are shown in Table 6 . All hypoth - esized effects show the same pattern though the significance level varies . Discussion Despite the intuitive and widely acknowledged importance of knowledge sharing , researchers have been unable to consis - tently observe a positive effect of knowledge sharing on team performance ( Choi et al . 2010 ; Haas and Hansen 2007 ; Zhou and Li 2012 ) . A meta - analysis on information sharing even indicates that more communicative teams can be less effective ( Mesmer - Magnus and DeChurch 2009 ) . This raises the ques - tion : Does knowledge sharing really have a positive effect on an NPD team ’ s innovation performance and , if not , then what influence does it have , and how ? Our research addresses these questions and offers new insights for both research and prac - tice . Contrary to “ the more , the better ” assumption , we dem - onstrate that customer knowledge sharing has a nonlinear ef - fect on NPD performance . Too few or too many knowledge sharing behaviors in a team may hurt , rather than benefit , NPD performance . Adopting a microfoundations perspective and building upon the socio - cognitive theory , we investigate the role of team cognition , i . e . , shared common customer knowl - edge and perceived diagnostic value of customer knowledge , in this process to better understand the nonlinear returns to customer knowledge sharing behaviors . Theoretical implications Across field studies in multiple B2B industries , our findings demonstrate that customer knowledge sharing behaviors exert a positive impact on NPD performance , but only to a certain level , beyond which this effect becomes negative . Thus , teams with a moderate amount of customer knowledge sharing be - haviors , i . e . , several times a week , witness the best perfor - mance outcome . Importantly , in contrast to prior research that has adopted “ the more , the better ” perspective , our findings suggest that it is excessive sharing , rather than insufficient sharing , that should be more concerning to managers . In a sample of 79 teams in Study 2 , about one third of the NPD teams had less than an optimal level of shared common knowledge , but two thirds had more than an optimal level of shared common knowledge . Thus , too much shared common knowledge seems to be more commonplace than too little . To the best of our knowledge , previous studies , including those in Mesmer - Magnus and DeChurch ’ s ( 2009 ) comprehensive meta - analysis on information sharing and team performance , have not examined nonlinear effects . Further , there have been mixed findings in prior research about the effects of knowl - edge sharing on NPD performance , where positive , non - sig - nificant , and occasionally negative effects have been reported . Our research contributes to the theoretical literature by reveal - ing a plausible explanation . Prior research has only examined the linear relationship between knowledge sharing and NPD performance , resulting in ( a ) an averaging of the positive and negative effects , or ( b ) the positive effects dominating the negative , and vice versa , over different ranges of data . As a second contribution , motivated by a microfoundations perspective , our research adopts a socio - cognitive lens to iden - tify an underlying theoretical mechanism , which demonstrates that the influence of customer knowledge sharing behaviors on NPD performance is mediated by the shared common cus - tomer knowledge in the team , and that a moderate , rather than a low or high level of shared common customer knowledge is best for NPD performance . In Study 2 , the optimal amount of shared common customer knowledge in a team is around 60 % on average . This extends social psychology research that warns that too much shared information is not beneficial for group performance in general ( Levine and Moreland 1999 ) .

( 2020 ) 48 : 288 – 307 301 Furthermore , we isolate the moderating influence of the perceived diagnostic value of customer knowledge in the team on the uncovered nonlinear relationship between shared com - mon knowledge and NPD performance . In particular , our re - sults reveal that the inflection point of the inverted U - shaped curve is shifted upward in teams with high levels of perceived diagnostic value of customer knowledge , strengthening the impact of shared common knowledge on NPD performance . This finding extends the literature on NPD management , which has not investigated the role of such managerial beliefs on NPD performance outcomes . Managerial implications Be wary of the downside of customer knowledge sharing Companies spend billions of dollars in order to facilitate knowledge sharing behaviors in NPD teams .

( 2020 ) 48 : 288 – 307 company strives to “ continue our practice of sharing as much information as possible with team members at every level ” ( Burke 2015 ) . However , our findings reveal that more is not necessarily better . With 2 . 5 quintillion bytes of data generated every day in this big data era ( Marr 2018 ) , companies need to be mindful about not getting lost in a sea of data . This is especially relevant to new product development where im - properly leveraging knowledge in NPD teams can become a liability . The current research shows that sharing customer knowledge several times a week is better than sharing once a week or less , which is consistent with the common wisdom that knowledge sharing is necessary for team success . However , it also reveals a downside of knowledge sharing — teams that engage in sharing daily or even a few times a day perform worse than those that engage in sharing several times a week . Managers should be aware that customer knowledge sharing is a double - edged sword . The best way for a team to work together is not by team members sharing and cross - learning everything , but by sharing moderately so that they can utilize each one ’ s strength and work efficiently as a team . Preserve individual customer knowledge stock Since shared customer knowledge is a direct consequence of knowledge sharing behaviors and is also the conduit of the inverted U - shaped effect that knowledge sharing exerts on NPD perfor - mance , it is equally if not more important for companies to monitor the extent of shared common customer knowledge in NPD teams . In the popular TV series “ The A - team ” , when pondering why the A - Team always outperforms , Colonel Decker famously noted , “ Ah , they ’ re the best . They think as one , feel as one and act as one . ” Our findings suggest that this common recipe for team success needs to be reconsidered . There is no doubt that teams should possess some common knowledge , but they also need to preserve individual knowl - edge stock . Manage team perception of customer knowledge Importantly , our research indicates that a team that perceives customer knowledge as consequential or diagnostic for innovation suc - cess will benefit more from the sharing of it . As shown in Fig . 3 , at any given amount of shared common customer knowl - edge in a team , if a team perceives customer knowledge as high in diagnostic value , then it will receive higher returns on NPD performance . This can be an actionable insight for man - agers who are unsure about the optimal point of knowledge sharing . Knowledge - intensive processes remain “ plagued by information quality problems , such as incorrect information and irrelevant information ” ( Gorla et al . 2010 , p . 209 ) . As such , managers should identify ways to promote purposeful , selective sharing of customer knowledge that is relevant , ac - curate , and valuable . Finally , as a word of caution , our research should not be interpreted as simply a call to discourage knowledge sharing in NPD teams . In fact , our results confirm that knowledge sharing activities are essential in order for team members to have access to each other ’ s knowledge and expertise , and to create shared knowledge at the team level . It is only when there is excessive sharing that problems arise . Based on our findings , we have suggested an optimal amount of within - team knowledge sharing — several times a week but less than daily . We encourage companies to set up guidelines for NPD team knowledge sharing best practices accordingly . Limitations and avenues for future research Our research has some limitations that yield promising ave - nues for future research . First , we did not address when and why there can be too much customer knowledge sharing in a team . Future research should investigate the antecedents of customer knowledge sharing to offer insights on how to avoid the trap of having “ too much . ” Second , there can be other potential mechanisms linking customer knowledge sharing to NPD performance . For example , other potential mediators may include the relevance and quality of the shared knowl - edge , the extent to which members share unique knowledge , and the breadth versus depth of the shared knowledge , just to name a few . In addition , future research can investigate the role of trust among members , and how the norm of reciprocity may affect knowledge sharing outcomes . Third , NPD is a stage - gate process ( Eling et al . 2013 ) . It is possible that our observed effect is stronger in one stage than in another . Future research should examine this and other possible moderating mechanisms . The development of knowledge sharing itself might also be multi - staged . Quantity of knowledge sharing may be the major concern at the early stages of NPD , whereas quality of knowledge sharing may be the major concern at the late stages . Lastly , future research can use longitudinal studies to capture the dynamic effects of knowledge sharing behaviors on NPD performance . In conclusion , knowledge sharing is a critical process , without which NPD teams lose their purpose , but too much sharing as well as too much shared common knowledge can hinder NPD performance . In a two - year research effort , code - named Project Aristotle , Google studied 180 of its work teams to answer the following question : What makes a team effec - tive ? As explained upon the conclusion of the project by Rozovsky ( 2015 ) , Google ’ s people analytics manager , “ who is on a team matters less than how the team members interact . ” Going back to Aristotle ’ s quote , “ the whole is greater than the sum of its parts , ” our research confirms that having just the right amount of customer knowledge sharing behaviors in an NPD team is an important balance for firms to find and maintain .
