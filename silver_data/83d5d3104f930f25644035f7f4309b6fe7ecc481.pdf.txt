We used intestinal organoids to quantitatively study the potency of multiva - lent cholera toxin inhibitors . The method enabled the determination of IC50 - values over a wide range of potencies ( 15 pM - 9 mM ) . The results indicate for the first time that an organoid - based swelling assay is a useful preclinical method to evaluate inhibitor potencies of drugs that target pathogen - derived toxins . INTRODUCTION Cholera toxin induces secretory diarrhea , resulting in severe dehydration 1 , 2 and affecting 1 . 4 - 4 . 3 million individ - uals worldwide , of which 28 , 000 - 143 , 000 die each year . 3 Current protection consists of two vaccines , Shanchol and Dukoral , which are widely used but not so promising for children under six years of age , the most vulnerable group . 4 Inhibitory potency of bioactive compounds against cholera is typically evaluated in the rabbit ileal loop assay . However , this method is excessively stressful for the animals , time - consuming , and difficult to stand - ardize . 5 We recently described a simple and robust fluid secre - tion assay in a model of primary human intestinal organ - oids . 6 , 7 Chemical induction of cAMP induces a rapid ac - cumulation of fluid in the central lumen , and the result - ing organoids swelling can be simply quantified . Using unmodified cells , this assay offers a drug testing platform for disease conditions involving fluid secretion , such as cystic fibrosis 6 or secretory diarrhea . For the latter condi - tion this remains to be demonstrated . Here we use the organoid swelling assay to characterize pharmacological inhibitors of cholera toxin . Cholera toxin consists of the core region part A and the outer pentamer - ic part B , that binds to the pentasaccharide part of GM1 - gangliosides . The binding is required for cell internaliza - tion , where cholera toxin A1 subunit is released into the cytosol ( Figure 1 ) . 1 , 2 A1 triggers cAMP - dependent intesti - nal fluid hypersecretion via ion channels and transport - ers . The main channel is the cystic fibrosis transmem - brane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) , which secretes chloride and bicarbonate . 1 , 2 , 8 Hypersecretion is followed by paracellular hypersecretion of sodium and water . 1 Numerous inhibitors for cholera toxin have been devel - oped over the years . Many of these are monovalent in - hibitors derived from structure - based design , 9 however , high potency inhibitors so far were all based on multiva - lent designs , 10 - 14 which contain several copies of the ligand attached to a single molecular scaffold , such as a den - drimer . 15 Such inhibitors likely bridge several of the bind - ing sites which greatly enhances the potency , possibly in combination with aggregation mechanisms . 16 Cholera toxin inhibitors that are based on GM1os have shown the highest inhibitory potency so far . 10 , 15 , 17 , 18 Recently , penta - valent versus tetravalent GM1os - based inhibitors were synthesized , compared and shown to be of similar subna - nomolar potency in an ELISA assay and they exhibited similar aggregation behavior of the toxin . 19 Page 1 of 6 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 Figure 1 . Proposed mechanism and effect of inhibitors on the pathway of cholera toxin . Most studies have reported the potency of the com - pounds using the same ELISA assay involving immobi - lized GM1 and HRP - conjugated CTB5 . While this assay works well and is reproducible , a more biorelevant assay is needed . The mentioned rabbit ileal loop assay does function , 20 but practical and ethical issues make it less suitable . We hypothesized that the swelling assay using human intestinal organoids could functionally assess the potency of cholera toxin inhibitors , thereby providing an additive method to current animal models . We used a series of inhibitors with a large range of potencies to also evaluate the dynamic range of the assay . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION For comparison with the organoid assay ELISA data were used ( Table 1 ) . We used the data from the recently reported tetravalent and pentavalent GM1os compounds 1 and 2 , 19 which are potent inhibitors in the picomolar range . Subsequently , the polar monovalent GM1os deriva - tive 3 was used , which showed an IC50 of 110 nM . It is relevant to mention the word hydrophilic GM1 derivative . This derivative does not aggregate and behaves like a single molecule . This in contrast to GM1 derivatives with lipophilic tails that form aggregates and can vary widely in their ability to inhibit cholera toxin . To mention two examples , GM1 with two lipophilic tails ( i . e native GM1 ganglioside ) , which forms large micelles , 21 inhibits in the low nanomolar range ( IC50 2 . 5 nM measured by us using the ELISA and similar values are obtained by others 22 ) . GM1 with one lipohilic tail leads to relatively poor mi - cromolar inhibition through an apparent counterproduc - tive aggregation . It seems the polar derivative 3 is in be - tween the two . 15 , 17 Next the non - spanning 23 GM1os dimer 4 with a short spacer , was included in the panel . Its IC50 of 8 nM was ca . one order of magnitude better than the monovalent 3 , which may be due to statistical rebinding effects , secondary binding effects of the second ligand or even the bridging of pentamers . Finally , free galactose ( 5 ) was included as a weak milimolar inhibitor .

Stimulating organoids for 4h with 10 ng / mL cholera toxin induced similar levels of swelling as saturating doses , but with suboptimal kinetics . A lag phase of approximately 60 - 100 minutes was observed before cholera toxin in - duced swelling , consistent with the uptake and processing of the toxin ( Figure 3 ) . For comparison , amounts of chol - era toxin detected in diarrhea has been detected as high as 1 µ g / mL . 25 Figure 3 . Organoids were stimulated with cholera toxin as indicated ( µg / mL ) and organoid swelling was measured by relative area increase in time ( t = 0 min : 100 % ) , n = 1 tripli - cate±SD . We next assessed dose - dependent inhibition of cholera toxin - mediated swelling of the four GM1os - based struc - tures that differ in valency for binding cholera toxin B subunit ( Figure 2 ) . Free galactose ( 5 ) was again measured as a weak reference inhibitor . Organoids were stimulated with cholera toxin , with or without inhibitors . We found that tetravalent and pentavalent GM1os compounds 1 and 2 were most potent in inhibiting cholera toxin - induced swelling with IC50 values in the picomolar range ( IC50 of 34 and 15 pM , respectively ) ( Figure 4a , Table 1 ) . Monova - lent and bivalent GM1os compounds 3 and 4 were less potent ( IC50 of 424 and 18 nM , respectively ) but still ef - fective . The monovalent compound 3 cannot take ad - vantage of bridging binding sites within a toxin while the bivalency of 4 seems to help here by a factor of ~ 20 - fold . Monovalent galactose was the least potent ( IC50 9 . 1 mM ) , as expected . 10 Also , for the highest dosages of inhibitors tested , organoids were additionally stimulated with for - skolin , an adenyl cyclase activator , to control for toxicity of the inhibitors on the CFTR channel . Forskolin - stimulated organoid swelling was observed for all the conditions tested , indicating that the cholera toxin inhibi - tors do not inhibit CFTR chloride secretion by acting on CFTR directly ( Figure 4b ) . Representative images are depicted in Figure 5 . The data indicate for the first time that multivalent GM1os - based compounds are highly effective in limiting cholera toxin - induced fluid secretion in human intestinal primary cells ( Figure 4a ) . The organoid assay exhibited a very large dynamic range , by clearly showing inhibition from the pico - to the millimolar range . The values corre - lated well with those obtained from the GM1 - based ELISA type assay . Nevertheless , the best inhibitors 1 and 2 showed even lower values with the organoids . This can be explained by the fact that the organoid assay requires less cholera toxin ( i . e . 10 ng / mL ) to give a clearly observa - ble phenomenon than the ELISA assay . Since we are talk - ing IC50 values , 50 % of the present CT molecules repre - sents ca . 58 pM , a value close to the observed IC50 values for 1 and 2 . The inhibition seems to be almost one to one in terms of stoichiometry , irrespective of whether at these concentrations aggregation phenomena 16 play a role , which is remarkable . a b Figure 4 .

However , with the use of organoids , the toxins are likely to bind basolateral to the epithelial cells , instead of luminal , which could have resulted in an over - estimation of the potencies . Furthermore , we did not take into account the adhesion of the bacterium itself . The data suggest that the cholera toxin inhibitors could be used as prophylactic or acute drugs to inhibit cholera toxins to bind to cells . When the toxins are already bound to epithelial cells and internalized , other approaches are needed , such as reducing Cl - hypersecretion or stimulat - ing Na + absorption , via cyclase inhibitors or NHE3 activa - tors , respectively . 8 , 26 Figure 5 . Representative images of organoids upon cholera toxin stimulation , with or without inhibitor 1 , conditions and time points as indicated . CONCLUSION The human primary organoid culture model provides a simple , robust and functional intestinal assay for com - pound inhibitory potency testing . The total organoid swelling easily quantitates fluid transport across the intes - tinal epithelium , mimicking the in vivo tissue . This assay platform will be important for preclinical development of drugs targeting pathogen - induced secretory diarrhea as shown here for compounds targeting cholera toxin . EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Human rectal biopsies . Rectal biopsies were collect - ed from a human subject after informed consent and approved by the local Ethics Committee . Generating and culturing organoids . Organoids were generated , and biobanked , slightly different as pre - viously described . 6 After washing with PBS , crypts were isolated from the biopsies , via incubation in 10 mM EDTA for 60 - 90 minutes at 4°C at a rocking platform . Crypts were collected , centrifuged and supernatant was re - moved . Crypts pellet was taken up in 40 % Matrigel ( Corn - ing , diluted in culture medium ) and droplets of crypts suspension were plated onto 24 - wells plates . After solidi - fication of the Matrigel ( ±10 minutes , 37°C ) , droplets were immersed in culture medium ( advanced DMEM / F12 sup - plemented with HEPES , GlutaMAX , penicillin , strepto - mycin , N - 2 , B - 27 , mEGF ( Life Technologies ) , N - acetylcysteine , nicotinamide , SB202190 ( Sigma ) , A83 - 01 ( Tocris ) , and 50 % Wnt3a - , 20 % Rspo - 1 - and 10 % Noggin - conditioned media ) . ) . In 7 days , crypts grew out into full grown organoids , which were passaged via mechanically disruption weekly . Medium was refreshed every 2 - 3 days and organoids were passaged at least 2 times before as - says were performed . Cholera toxin and inhibitors . Cholera toxin from Vibrio cholerae ( Sigma ) was used to stimulate organoid fluid secretion . Cholera toxin inhibitors were pre - incubated for 4h with cholera toxin prior to organoid stimulation . The ( multivalent ) structures of the inhibitors are based on GM1os , and monovalent free galactose serves as a reference compound . 19 Monovalent inhibitor 3 : A solution of GM1os - β - NAc - propargyl ( Elicityl , Grenoble ) ( 8 . 3 mg , 7 . 7 µ mol ) , 11 - azido - 3 , 6 , 9 - trioxaundecanol ( 3 . 4 mg , 15 . 5 µ mol ) , CuSO4•5H2O ( 1 . 9 mg , 7 . 7 µ mol ) and sodium ascorbate ( 3 . 1 mg , 15 . 5 µ mol ) in H2O / DMF ( 1 / 1 , v / v , 2 mL ) was heated under microwave irradiation at 80 ° C for 20 min .

Measuring CFTR function in intestinal organoids was performed slightly different as previously described . 6 Organoids cultured for 7 days were mechanically disrupted and re - seeded into flat - bottom 96 - wells plates in 40 % Matrigel and culture medium . Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C , 5 % CO2 . The next day , cholera toxin was incubated with cholera toxin inhibitors for 4 h at r . t . , prior to the organoid stimulation . Organoids were stained with calcein AM ( Invitrogen ) , 1h prior to the stimulation . Organoids were stimulated with the mix of cholera toxin ( 0 . 01 µg / ml ) and inhibitors ( titra - tion ) for 4h and additionally with forskolin ( 0 . 1 µM , Sig - ma ) for some conditions for another hour . Swelling of organoids was monitored in time using the Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope ( images every 15 minutes during cholera stimulation , every 10 minutes during forskolin stimulation ) . Organoid area increase was analyzed using Volocity and calculations were done with GraphPad Prism 6 . ASSOCIATED CONTENT Supporting Information . NMR spectra of the new com - pounds are included .
