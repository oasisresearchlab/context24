nature methods | VOL . 9 NO . 12 | DECEMBER 2012 | 1133 correspondence Fluorescence and super - resolution standards based on DNA origami To the Editor : In recent years , the ability to validate micros - copy techniques as well as distinguish instrument - specific from sample - specific error sources has not kept up with the pace of progress in fluorescence , and especially super - resolution , imag - ing . Commonly , new methods are demonstrated by imaging cel - lular filaments whose labeling and preparation cannot be easily reproduced . A desired validation standard requires , on one hand , structural control to position distinct marks at defined distances . On the other hand , the validation standard has to provide stoi - chiometric control , which implies the ability to place a defined number of molecules of equal brightness per mark . We present molecular rulers based on self - assembled DNA origami struc - tures as a general and highly versatile platform for fluorescence and super - resolution standards . Examples include fluorescence brightness standards as well as standards covering a distance range from 6 to 386 nm that are adapted to the needs of the specific microscopy technique , including stimulated emission depletion ( STED ) , localization - based super - resolution and diffraction - limited microscopy . Scaffolded DNA origamis are produced by hybridizing ~ 200 staple oligonucleotides to a long single - stranded DNA scaffold to yield a predefined shape 1 . DNA origamis can be labeled at specific sites with fluorescent dyes by using dye - modified staple strands ( Supplementary Methods ) . For DNA origami brightness stan - dards , we imaged rectangular DNA origamis ( Fig . 1a ) with 1 – 36 ATTO647N molecules ( minimal interdye distance is 6 nm ) immobilized on coverslips by fluorescence lifetime imaging .

All three distances ( d ) could be well reproduced with values of d 1 = 5 . 8 ± 2 . 9 nm , d 2 = 10 . 7 ± 1 . 8 nm and d 3 = 18 . 3 ± 5 . 7 nm ( mean ± s . d . , n = 30 ) ( Fig . 1e ) . DNA origami – based fluorescence standards have matured into ready - to - use validation samples . After being covered with a poly - mer layer , the origami standards can be transported and stored for 12 months ( Supplementary Figs . 7 and 8 ) . We propose DNA origamis as a standard platform to test and prove abilities of new super - resolution techniques as well as for everyday use to distinguish instrument - specific from sample - specific error sources in fluores - cence imaging .

Analysis of the photons per spot for all samples revealed a linear dependence of intensity on dye number ( Fig . 1a ) and excitation intensity ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . The linear dependence on dye number is notable because samples with such a high density of fluorophores commonly exhibit self - quenching . A comparison with commercially available fluorescent beads ( dark red FluoSpheres ( Invitrogen ) showed that DNA origamis with as few as 12 ATTO647N molecules are brighter than FluoSpheres and exhibit a more homogeneous intensity and fluorescence lifetime ( Supplementary Fig . 1b – e ) . Labeled DNA origamis can therefore be used as brightness standards to quantify microscope sensitivities and relate emission intensities to absolute numbers of fluorescent molecules . With the DNA origami platform , dyes can be positioned at dis - tances from the Förster resonance energy transfer range 2 up to distances corresponding to the longest axis of the specific DNA origami . For a calibration standard that can be resolved by conven - tional diffraction - limited microscopes , we constructed a six - helix bundle that has a persistence length of ~ 2 µ m ( ref . 3 ) and placed two ATTO647N molecules at a contour - length distance of 386 nm ( Fig . 1b ) . A confocal image shows the resulting dumbbell - shaped spots that were resolved by the diffraction - limited microscope . The histogram of the spot separations ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) yields a distance of 357 nm , demonstrating that robust standards exceeding diffraction - limited dimensions could be constructed from single DNA origami scaffolds . STED was the first far - field super - resolution microscopy method that abandoned the diffraction barrier , and it is the most promi - nent representative of a family of super - resolution microscopy tech - niques based on targeted switching of molecules in a predetermined region 4 . We created a nanoruler for pulsed STED with a distance of 71 nm between two parallel lines of 12 ATTO647N molecules each . The lines were not resolved in a confocal microscope with 5 % STED beam intensity ( Fig . 1c ) . An increase of the doughnut - shaped STED beam intensity to 50 % of its maximum caused the spots to shrink because of stimulated emission quenching in the outer parts of the laser focus , and at 100 % STED beam intensity , corresponding to 110 mW , the two lines were well resolved ( Fig . 1c ) . Analysis of the 71 - nm ruler , a 44 - nm ruler and an 80 - nm ruler for continuous - wave STED are presented in Supplementary Figures 3 and 4 . An alternative approach for super - resolution imaging exploits the successive localization of single blinking or photoactivatable molecules 5 . We broadened our initial experiments on single - molecule localization on DNA origami 6 to measure < 100 - nm dis - tances in different spectral ranges ( Fig . 1d and Supplementary Figs . 5 and 6 ) . To show that DNA origami standards can cover the full range from diffraction - limited to molecular dimensions , we constructed DNA origami rectangles with two ATTO647N molecules separated by a distance of 6 , 12 or 18 nm ( Fig . 1e ) . For these standards , we used successive photobleaching and analyzed fluorescence transients from identified spots with respect to photobleaching steps . The individual molecules were localized in reverse order of photobleaching , and the intensity distribution of the second molecule was subtracted from that of the first part of the transient ( Fig . 1e ) . The corresponding localization map shows a clear separation of the two dye molecules . The histogram of localizations reveals a distance of 5 . 7 nm well in Flaws in evaluation schemes for pair - input computational predictions To the Editor : Computational prediction methods that oper - ate on pairs of objects by considering features of each ( hereafter referred to as pair - input methods ) have been crucial in many areas of biology and chemistry over the past decade . Among the most prominent examples are protein - protein interaction ( PPI ) 1 , protein - drug interaction 2 , 3 , protein - RNA interaction 4 and drug indication 5 prediction methods . A sampling of more than 50 published studies involving pair - input methods is provided in Supplementary Table 1 . Here we demonstrate that the paired nature of inputs has significant , though not yet widely perceived , implications for the validation of pair - input methods . The effects that the paired nature of inputs has on the cross - validation of pair - input methods can be seen in the following example .
