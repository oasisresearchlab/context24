The mechanisms by which viruses co - opt the clathrin machinery for efficient internalization remain uncertain . Here we examined how clathrin - coated vesicles accommodate vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) during its entry into cells . Using high - resolution imaging of the internalization of single viral particles into cells expressing fluorescent clathrin and adaptor molecules , we show that VSV enters cells through partially clathrin - coated vesicles . We found that on average , virus - containing vesicles contain more clathrin and clathrin adaptor molecules than conventional vesicles , but this increase is insufficient to permit full coating of the vesicle . We further show that virus - containing vesicles depend upon the actin machinery for their internalization . Specifically , we found that components of the actin machinery are recruited to virus - containing vesicles , and chemical inhibition of actin polymerization trapped viral particles in vesicles at the plasma membrane . By analysis of multiple independent virus internalization events , we show that VSV induces the nucleation of clathrin for its uptake , rather than depending upon random capture by formation of a clathrin - coated pit . This work provides new mechanistic insights into the process of virus internalization as well as uptake of unconventional cargo by the clathrin - dependent endocytic machinery .

In this process , the plasma membrane typically invaginates into a clathrin - coated pit , in which adaptor molecules bridge the interaction of clathrin with cargo . During invagination , the ubiquitous adaptor protein complex , AP - 2 , binds to specific sorting signals in the cytosolic tails of membrane proteins , and to phospholipids and clathrin . As the coated pit grows , additional clathrin and adaptor molecules assemble to form an enclosed and fully coated structure [ 1 ] . Separation of this pit from the plasma membrane requires a large GTPase , dynamin [ 2 , 3 ] ; clathrin rapidly uncoats from the resulting coated vesicle through action of the Hsc70 ATPase and its cofactor , auxilin [ 4 , 5 ] . Infection by many viruses is sensitive to inhibition of the clathrin pathway . Among the best - studied examples is vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) , a prototype of the Rhabdoviridae . Initial evidence for the clathrin - dependent uptake of VSV comes from electron micrographs that show viral particles present within coated pit structures [ 6 , 7 ] . More recent experiments show that viral gene expression is inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate clone 15 ( Eps15 ) , a protein involved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis , or by treatment of cells with siRNA targeted to clathrin heavy chain [ 8 ] . A functional clathrin pathway is therefore required for efficient viral infection . Coated pit assembly in vivo has been followed in detail by live cell imaging , using individual , fluorescently labeled low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) and reovirus particles to visualize cargo [ 1 ] . The kinetics of internalization are in both cases consistent with capture of the cargo by randomly initiating coated pits . Moreover , the amount of clathrin required to complete coated pit assembly scales as the area needed to engulf particles having the relative diameters of the two ligands . In studies using the same cell line , coated pits containing influenza A particles were reported to resemble those lacking virions ( and presumed to contain other cargo molecules ) , but internalization of the virus appeared to occur through pits that formed directly at the site of virus binding , as if the influenza virus induced its own uptake [ 9 ] . The differences in uptake kinetics between LDL or reovirus and influenza virus suggest that there may be multiple modes of coated - pit initiation and that distinct initiation modes may entrain distinct assembly mechanisms and possibly distinct destinations for the endocytosed cargo . PLoS Pathogens | www . plospathogens . org 1 April 2009 | Volume 5 | Issue 4 | e1000394 Influenza and reovirus particles are both roughly spherical and not greatly different in size ( 120 and 85 nm diameter , respectively ) , so particle dimensions alone probably cannot explain the apparently different uptake modalities . VSV is a bullet - shaped particle , 180 6 70 nm , much longer than the diameter of influenza or reovirus and comparable in cross section . To probe the limits and correlates of alternative endocytic mechanisms , we have determined the kinetics of VSV endocytosis into clathrin - coated vesicles . Vesicles internalizing VSV appear to contain insufficient clathrin to coat fully a virus - containing vesicle . The coated pits recruit actin and associated proteins in a step that is essential for release of the vesicles from the plasma membrane . We integrate these observations , together with evidence from electron micros - copy , into a model of VSV internalization . We conclude that VSV and potentially other cargo are internalized through an altered mode of clathrin - based endocytosis . Results Live cell imaging of VSV entry To image the internalization of single VSV particles in live cells , we conjugated the fluorescent dye , Alexa Fluor 647 to purified virions . This labeling process did not significantly reduce viral titer as measured by plaque assay ( Figure S1A ) . Examination of labeled VSV particles by spinning disc confocal fluorescent microscopy showed distinct , diffraction - limited puncta with a single Gaussian distribution of fluorescence intensities ( Figure S1B ) . This result is consistent with a lack of aggregates and the presence of single virus particles . To examine how clathrin - coated pits internalize VSV , we infected BSC - 1 cells stably expressing tomato - clathrin light chain A1 ( tom - LCa ) and acquired images from the bottom surface of cells using a spinning disc confocal microscope . Single VSV particles attached to cells , and over the 6 – 10 min . time course of 28 time - lapse videos , more than 90 % ( 133 / 146 ) of the attached particles associated with tom - LCa ( Figure 1A , B , S3 ) . Moreover , the tom - LCa fluorescence signal increased over time and then abruptly disappeared as the vesicle uncoated ( Figure 1A , C , Videos S1 , S2 ) . More than 70 % ( 98 / 133 ) of the captured particles underwent rapid , directed movement shortly after disappearance of the clathrin signal , indicating intracellular transport of virus - containing vesicles ( Videos S1 , S2 ) . The few particles that failed to associate with clathrin remained at the cell surface and did not exhibit this rapid , directed motion . Thus , clathrin - mediated endocytosis accounts for the uptake of most attached VSV particles . AP - 2 is a functional adaptor for productive internalization of VSV through clathrin - coated pits To determine if AP - 2 is present in clathrin - coated pits that contain VSV , we imaged virus internalization in cells expressing tom - LCa and the s 2 subunit of AP - 2 fused to eGFP ( s 2 - eGFP ) . Without exception , s 2 - eGFP appeared and disappeared along with tom - LCa ( Figure 1C – E ) , demonstrating that VSV internal - ization occurs in clathrin - coated pits that contain AP - 2 . We examined the abundance and the association kinetics of tom - LCa and s 2 - eGFP in pits that contain virus and compared them with pits that lack virus . Clathrin and AP - 2 recruitment are initially similar , independent of virus ( Figure 1D , E ) , but virus - containing pits often show a transient plateau in the accumulation of tom - LCa followed by a subsequent burst of clathrin accumulation ( Figure 1D , E ) . Pits containing virus showed longer lifetimes and on average contained more clathrin and AP - 2 than pits in the same cell that lacked virus ( Figure 1E , F ) . Combined with other experiments in cells expressing tom - LCa ( see below ) , we measured clathrin accumulation and pit lifetime for 46 pits containing virus and compared them with 92 that lacked virus . Pits containing virus recruit on average 1 . 5 - fold more clathrin , and have lifetimes of 110 + / 2 44 s , compared to 51 + / 2 16 s for pits lacking virus ( Figure 1F ) . Thus , efficient internalization of VSV occurs through coated pits containing AP - 2 , and compared with pits lacking virus , those containing virus have increased lifetimes and often contain more clathrin and AP - 2 . Using siRNA to target the m 2 subunit of AP - 2 in cells constitutively expressing s 2 - eGFP , we showed that AP - 2 depletion completely inhibited clathrin - dependent VSV internalization ( Figure 2 ) . Loss of m 2 can be followed by disappearance of the s 2 - eGFP signal from coated pits , as assembly of one AP - 2 heterotetramer depends on all four of its subunits . As expected , cells lacking detectable s 2 - eGFP ( . 95 % of the population ) failed to take up an AP - 2 dependent cargo , transferrin , which remained trapped at the cell surface ( Figure 2A , red signal ) . Moreover , inspection of 37 virus particles attached to 5 different cells depleted for AP - 2 showed that VSV remained attached at the cell surface ( Figure 2A , blue signal ) . By contrast , cells treated with a control siRNA displayed normal levels of s 2 - eGFP , robust transferrin uptake , and maintained the capacity to internalize VSV ( 42 / 63 particles ; 8 cells ) ( Figure 2A , B ) . In other cells , traces of AP - 2 expression remained following siRNA treatment . Under such conditions , we found that low levels of AP - 2 accumulated beneath particles , and that virus was internalized by clathrin ( not shown ) . Thus , low levels of AP - 2 are sufficient for clathrin - dependent virus uptake . Using a recombinant VSV that expresses firefly luciferase as a marker of infection ( rVSV - LUC ) , we further show that m 2 depletion resulted in diminished infection of cells as indicted by a 65 % reduction in luciferase activity ( Figure 2C ) . These data demonstrate that AP - 2 is essential for the clathrin - dependent uptake of VSV . Dynamin is required for VSV entry Using cells expressing low levels of dynamin2 - eGFP ( dyn2 - eGFP ) and tom - LCa , we compared dynamin recruitment to 11 pits containing virus with 18 that lacked virus . As previously demonstrated for pits lacking virus , dynamin recruitment increased rapidly during late stages of pit growth ( Figure 3A – C ) . Virus - containing pits also recruit dynamin , with a spike during the later stages of growth ( Figure 3A – C , Video S3 ) . Quantitation of Author Summary Clathrin - dependent endocytosis accounts for the majority of uptake from the plasma membrane . However , many viruses that infect cells through an endocytic route are larger than the dimensions of a typical clathrin - coated vesicle . Working with vesicular stomatitis virus , we deter - mined how this cargo enters cells . We present evidence that VSV induces its own uptake by the clathrin - dependent endocytic machinery following binding to the plasma membrane . The clathrin - coated vesicles that contain virus differ from vesicles that internalize conventional clathrin dependent cargo such as LDL and transferrin . Specifically , we show that VSV particles are internalized by vesicles that are only partially coated with clathrin , rather than the complete coat found on conventional vesicles . We show that the clathrin - dependent endocytic adaptor AP - 2 is required for entry . Finally , we show for the first time that actin is recruited to virus - containing pits and that particle internalization depends upon actin function . Our work provides new mechanistic insights into VSV entry that may be directly relevant in understanding the clathrin depen - dent uptake of other viruses . Clathrin and Actin - Dependent VSV Entry PLoS Pathogens | www . plospathogens . org 2 April 2009 | Volume 5 | Issue 4 | e1000394 the peak dyn2 - eGFP fluorescence shows that virus - containing pits recruit an average of five times more dynamin than pits lacking virus ( Figure 3C , D ) . Using dynasore [ 10 ] , a cell permeable small molecule inhibitor of dynamin , we showed that dynamin function is required for clathrin - dependent internalization of VSV . As previously reported Figure 1 . Live cell imaging of clathrin - dependent endocytosis of single VSV particles .

The peak clathrin fluorescence intensities in pits containing and lacking virus was 155 + / 2 69 and 100 + / 2 34 , respectively . The difference between these values is statistically significant ( Student’s t - test : p = 1e - 6 ) . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1000394 . g001 Clathrin and Actin - Dependent VSV Entry PLoS Pathogens | www . plospathogens . org 3 April 2009 | Volume 5 | Issue 4 | e1000394 [ 10 ] , addition of dynasore caused arrest of coated pit formation and trapped clathrin structures at the plasma membrane ( Figure 3E ) . Clathrin - dependent uptake of VSV was likewise completely inhibited ( Figure 3E , F ) . Virus particles that entered coated pits within the first minute following dynasore addition failed to internalize and remained trapped for the 13 min . duration of the time - lapse video in structures that contained clathrin and AP - 2 ( Figure 3E and Video S4 ) . Of 144 virus particles that attached to cells in the presence of dynasore , none was internalized by clathrin ( Figure 3F ) , in contrast to the highly efficient clathrin - dependent internalization of VSV in the absence of dynasore ( Figure 3F ) . Using the rVSV - LUC assay , we also showed that dynasore functionally inhibits viral entry ( Figure 3G ) . VSV gene expression was relatively insensitive to the addition of dynasore at 1 hour post - inoculation but not to its addition just prior to virus inoculation ( Figure 3G ) . These data show that functional dynamin is critical for clathrin - dependent uptake of VSV and concomitant productive infection of cells . Auxilin recruitment to vesicles containing VSV The cellular ATPase , Hsc70 , and its cofactor , auxilin , catalyze clathrin disassembly from endocytic vesicles . Auxilin1 is recruited to coated pits upon completion of clathrin growth at the time of vesicle budding , triggering rapid uncoating of the newly formed vesicle [ 4 , 5 ] . Using cells co - expressing eGFP - aux1 and tom - LCa , we examined whether coated pits that contain virus also recruit auxilin . We acquired images at 2 - second intervals to ensure that we captured the full kinetics of auxilin arrival . We imaged the internalization of 7 viral particles and compared the lifetimes and abundance of tom - LCa and eGFP - aux1 in these vesicles with 12 that lacked virus . The extent of auxilin1 recruitment to coated pits was unaltered by the presence of VSV ( Figure 4A , Video S5 ) . By measuring the duration of the spike in eGFP - aux1 fluorescence , we found a slight but statistically insignificant increase in the duration of the auxilin burst from 5 + / 2 1 s to 7 + / 2 2 s during VSV entry . These data show that virus - containing vesicles uncoat similarly to those that lack virus ( Figure 4B ) . Local actin polymerization during VSV internalization The effects of VSV on clathrin - coated pit formation suggest parallels with internalization of large and more stable clathrin - coated structures ( Saffarian and Kirchhausen , submitted ) and the invasive bacteria Listeria monocytogenes [ 11 ] . Actin polymerization has a role in the internalization of such structures , although it is not required for internalization of conventional clathrin - coated pits [ 12 ] and Saffarian and Kirchhausen , submitted . We therefore tested whether actin , an actin nucleation factor , Arp3 , or cortactin , an activator of the Arp2 / 3 complex , is recruited to coated pits . We used for this purpose , cells expressing tom - LCa and eGFP fused to each of these proteins . During growth of virus - containing pits , the levels of actin , Arp3 , and cortactin increased steadily ( Figure 5B , D and F ) . Moreover , for both Arp3 and cortactin , there was a peak of fluorescence just prior to the onset of vesicle uncoating ( Figure 5A – F , Videos S6 , S7 , S8 ) . In contrast , pits that lacked VSV had low and variable levels of actin and Arp3 fluorescence throughout the growth phase that were barely above the background ( Figure 5B and D ) . Cortactin recruitment was approximately 4 - fold lower than observed in virus - containing pits ( Figure 5F ) . We conclude that actin assembly is associated with VSV entry through a clathrin pathway . Inhibition of actin polymerization reduces the efficiency of VSV internalization To assess the importance of actin function during VSV internalization , we used cytochalasin D ( cytoD ) or latrunculin B ( latB ) to inhibit actin assembly . CytoD binds to the growing ends of actin filaments [ 13 ] , and latB sequesters G - actin monomers [ 14 ] . As shown previously [ 12 ] , cytoD or latB diminishes the number of clathrin - coated pit nucleation events , but has no effect on either the kinetics of coat assembly or the subsequent internalization of these pits ( Figure 6C ) .

Instead , both compounds inhibited entry by blocking by at least 75 % the transition of virus - containing pits to completed vesicles ( Figure 6B ) . We further established that treatment with cytoD , which has little detectable effects on the kinetics of virus - free coated pit formation , freezes assembly of virus - containing clathrin coats ( Figure 6D ) . In the presence of cytoD , the increase in clathrin fluorescence at puncta labeled by VSV reached a level similar to the average level for untreated cells , but the two labels then remained associated , often for the duration of the experiment ( Figure 6D , Video S9 ) . Those virus particles that did internalize ( as detected by loss of clathrin signal and rapid motion of virus label away from the site of coated - pit formation ) Figure 3 .

Using rVSV - LUC , we also showed that treatment with cytoD and latB during infection had a dose - dependent effect on luciferase gene expression , while introduction of these compounds at 1 hour post - infection had little effect for over three hours following addition of the drug ( Figure 6E , F ) . We conclude that actin assembly is critical for internalization of VSV but not for gene expression once virus has entered . Moreover , at least one actin - dependent step is essential for completion , pinching and dissociation of the clathrin coat , but not for its nucleation and initial assembly . Clathrin assembly is locally induced by VSV particles Is capture of VSV by a coated pit a random diffusional collision as it is for LDL [ 1 ] , or does the virus induce coat formation after binding ? We studied the trajectories of 37 virus particles at the cell surface and found that most ( n = 25 ) diffused randomly ( Figure 7A , B ) , with diffusion coefficients ( D ) between 5 6 10 2 11 cm 2 s 2 1 and 5 6 10 2 12 cm 2 s 2 1 . A subset of particles moved more rapidly ( average D = 5 6 10 2 10 cm 2 s 2 1 ) but eventually also slowed to comparable diffusion rates ( Figure 7A ) . Regardless of the initial diffusion rate , all viral particles became essentially immobile at least 20 s ( mean = 42 s ) prior to the earliest detection of clathrin ( Figure 7A , B ) . For the subset of particles that attached during imaging and then entered productively ( n = 98 ) , the average time between virus binding and clathrin detection was 122 s ( Figure 7C ) . Analysis of all virus capture events showed that clathrin colocalized with particles from the moment of its detection , indicating that pits that capture VSV form close to or directly beneath virions . To test whether our experimental observations are consistent or not with a random capture of VSV by clathrin , we performed a Monte - Carlo simulation . We used MATLAB to approximate the random motion of VSV particles on a 100 6 100 grid with the experimentally determined diffusion rate of 1 6 10 2 11 cm 2 s 2 1 . We estimated a viral footprint of 120 6 120 nm 2 , which is a generous estimate of the surface area directly contacted by a virus of 180 6 70 nm . We introduced clathrin - coated pits with lifetimes of 20 s ( the time beyond which a pit would be too constricted to accommodate a VSV particle ) at random locations according to the experimentally determined nucleation rate of 0 . 6 pits / 10 8 nm 2 s 2 1 , which was derived from 6 cells . To estimate the diffusion coefficient , we calculated the typical rate of particle displacement by plotting the square of the mean displacement versus time ( Figure 7B ) . The slope of the line of best - fit provides a rate of 0 . 0041 m 2 s 2 1 , which we used to calculate a representative diffusion coefficient ( D ) of 1 6 10 2 11 cm 2 s 2 1 using the formula : ( mean displacement ) 2 = 4Dt . This most accurately reflects the rate of virus diffusion at the time of capture ( Figure 7B ) . Using these parameters , the average time to virus capture was 2000 s , which is markedly different to the measured time of 122 s ( Figure 7C ) . Our simulation predicts a mean capture time of 18 seconds for an LDL particle , which is in good agreement with the experimental value of 20 seconds [ 1 ] . This validates our simulation protocol , and together with the virus data , provides evidence that pits engaged in virus uptake preferentially nucleate in close proximity to VSV particles . Discussion We examined how VSV enters host cells via the clathrin - dependent endocytic machinery using a combination of high - resolution live cell imaging , electron microscopy and quantitative assays for viral infectivity . By comparing clathrin - dependent uptake of single virus particles with canonical coated vesicle formation , we uncovered striking differences between these two processes . Unlike typical coated vesicles , virus - containing vesicles lacked a full clathrin coat and required local actin polymerization after coat assembly for efficient internalization . We also obtained evidence that VSV promotes its own uptake by inducing clathrin coat formation in close proximity to the virus particle . This study uncovers one mechanism by which mammalian cells internalize large clathrin - dependent cargo through the coordinated action of endocytic and cytoskeletal components . This mode of clathrin - dependent endocytosis shares some features of the clathrin endocytic machinery of Saccharomyces cerevisae , as well as the uptake of large bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes into mammalian cells . VSV internalization through partially clathrin - coated structures We previously established the direct relationship between coat size and clathrin or AP - 2 fluorescent intensity associated with endocytic coated pits and vesicles [ 1 ] .

On average , virus - containing vesicles contained 1 . 5 - fold more clathrin , with a maximum of 2 . 5 - fold more , and in some instances , less clathrin than vesicles lacking virus ( Figure 1F ) . Although pits internalizing VSV tend to have more clathrin , the increase is insufficient to coat fully a vesicle containing a viral particle . The size of VSV particles is 180 6 70 nm , which could fit within a spherical vesicle with an internal radius of 90 nm , or within a Figure 5 .

The surface area of such vesicles is respectively 9 and 3 times greater than that of a conventional clathrin - coated vesicle with an internal radius of 30 nm . Thus to be completely coated with clathrin , virus - containing vesicles would require at least 3 times the amount of clathrin observed on a conventional vesicle . Our data are not consistent with this level of clathrin on vesicles internalizing VSV , which leads us to conclude that clathrin does not fully coat such vesicles . Further support for this conclusion is provided by electron micrographs that show VSV present within clathrin - coated structures that contain an elongated tubular neck that lacks the characteristic clathrin density ( Figure 8A ) . These images are also consistent with earlier electron micrographs that show VSV entering cells where clathrin is apparent on only a portion of the vesicle [ 15 , 16 , 17 ] . However , it was uncertain from this earlier work as to whether the static EM images represent an intermediate stage of the clathrin assembly process during virus internalization . By examining this process in real time in live cells , our data provides compelling evidence that virus enters cells in vesicles that lack a full clathrin coat . Clathrin adaptor usage during virus internalization The heterotetrameric AP - 2 adaptor complex recruits clathrin triskelions to the plasma membrane through direct interactions with phospholipids , receptor molecules , and clathrin . Almost all clathrin - coated pits at the cell surface contain AP - 2 , and depletion of its m 2 subunit reduces pit formation . 10 - fold [ 18 ] . Function - ally , AP - 2 depletion inhibits transferrin uptake [ 18 ] ; however , its effect on other clathrin - dependent cargo is less clear . For example , depletion of the s 2 subunit of AP - 2 inhibits EGF uptake at 37 u C Figure 6 . Chemical inhibition of actin polymerization reduces the efficiency of VSV internalization . ( A – D ) Where indicated , BSC - 1 cells were treated with 20 m M cytochalasin D ( cytoD ) , or 6 . 3 m M latrunculin B ( latB ) for 10 min . prior to inoculation with VSV and acquisition of time - lapse images . Video S9 depicts the effect of cytoD treatment on VSV internalization . The % of attached particles captured by a coated pit ( A ) , and subsequently internalized ( B ) , along with the % of CCP lacking virus that complete within 80 s ( C ) , were plotted to generate the graphs shown .

Clathrin fluorescence is expressed relative to its intensity in untreated pits lacking virus , which were set to 100 . Internalization was analyzed from 4 cells in the absence of cytoD ( 16 complete VSV internalizations , 23 complete non viral events ) or 3 cells ( 8 complete and 11 incomplete VSV events , 24 complete non viral events ) in the presence of cytoD . The peak clathrin fluorescence in viral events was not statistically significantly different in the presence and absence of cytoD ( Student’s t - test p = 0 . 2 for complete and incomplete events ) .

For influenza A virus , depletion of epsin 1 [ 21 ] , but not the a - subunit of AP - 2 [ 20 ] , impaired the clathrin - dependent internalization of virus particles . Following submission of this manuscript , a related study of the internalization of VSV reported that depletion of the a - and m - subunits of AP - 2 in HeLa cells did not inhibit infection [ 22 ] . However , the authors were unable to directly image the viral entry step and thus could not determine whether the virus entered the AP - 2 depleted HeLa cells in a clathrin - dependent or independent manner . In the present study , we found that depletion of m 2 - adaptin in BSC - 1 cells prevents clathrin - dependent uptake of VSV and diminishes viral VSV gene expression ( Figure 2 ) . In BSC - 1 cells simultaneously expressing s 2 - eGFP and tom - LCa , AP - 2 ablation reduced the rate of coated vesicle formation by , 10 - fold , and pits that formed contained low levels of AP - 2 . Importantly , VSV was only internalized by clathrin containing structures that also contained s 2 - eGFP fluorescence . Thus , our data supports an essential requirement for AP - 2 in the clathrin - dependent uptake of VSV , at least in BSC - 1 cells . Why the clathrin - dependent endocytosis of influenza A virus is insensitive to AP - 2 depletion and appears to depend on Epsin 1 is not clear . Perhaps this distinction reflects differences in cellular receptor usage or the capacity to trigger recruitment of specific cell factors to sites of virus binding . The actin machinery plays a key role in virus internalization Although much evidence supports a role for the actin machinery in clathrin - dependent endocytosis in the yeast Saccha - romyces cerevisae , its role in mammalian cells is uncertain . In S . cerevisae , clathrin - coated patches on the cell surface mature into , 200 nm tubular invaginations with coat proteins at their tip [ 23 ] . The actin cytoskeletal machinery is recruited after coat formation and provides an essential force for membrane deformation and internalization [ 24 ] . In mammalian cells , clathrin structures differ in their actin dependency for internalization . Chemical inhibitors of actin polymerization reduce the rate of clathrin - coated pit formation by 2 - fold but do not block the uptake of conventional coated pits [ 12 ] . Live cell imaging studies have provided evidence that a subset of clathrin structures assembled at the plasma membrane recruit the actin machinery and require actin function for their internalization [ 12 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 ] . What distinguishes this subset of structures is uncertain , but they may correspond to large arrays of clathrin , as their lifetimes are much longer ( . 60 s ) than that of conventional coated pits . In the present study , we found that clathrin structures internalizing VSV require actin polymerization for efficient uptake into cells ( Figure 6 ) . Analogous to the situation in yeast [ 24 , 29 ] , actin polymerization is required downstream of clathrin recruit - Figure 7 . Kinetics of VSV diffusion and capture by clathrin - coated pits .

Precisely what step of internalization is actin - dependent is uncertain , but perhaps actin filament formation facilitates the invagination and possibly fission of coated pits containing a VSV particle . Our findings of a requirement for the actin machinery in VSV internalization contrast with earlier work , which showed that VSV infection of polarized MDCK cells from the apical but not from the basolateral surface was inhibited on treatment of cells with cyto D [ 30 ] . In those experiments , however , the basolateral uptake of luciferase yellow , a general tracer for all forms of internalization , was not affected . Thus , basolateral entry Figure 8 . Visual comparison of CCV formation and VSV entry . ( A ) Electron micrographs depicting successive stages of CCV formation ( top ) and VSV entry ( bottom ) . Clathrin appears as an electron dense coat on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane , and early stages of clathrin assembly are indistinguishable . Conventional pits then adopt a constricted U shape , while virus - containing structures form elongated clathrin - coated tubes . Pits lacking virus become fully coated and pinch off from the membrane as spherical vesicles , but viral pits mature into much larger , partially uncoated structures . In the indicated samples , cells were treated with 20 m M cytoD for 10 min . , and incubated with rVSV at an M . O . I . of 5000 for 15 min . Cells were fixed and stained as described in Materials and Methods . ( B ) Model of VSV internalization by the clathrin and actin machinery . Conventional clathrin - coated vesicles ( top ) constitutively nucleate on the cell surface and grow by addition of clathrin and adaptor proteins until a fully - coated , constricted pit is formed . Pits are severed from the plasma membrane in a dynamin - dependent , but actin - independent manner , and the clathrin coat is rapidly disassembled by Hsc70 and auxilin . During clathrin - dependent internalization of VSV , pits preferentially form in close proximity to virus particles . The growing clathrin lattice imparts a curvature to the tip of the pit , but coat assembly ceases when the constricted edge of the pit meets the enclosed particle . The actin cytoskeletal machinery is then recruited by dynamin to drive further invagination of the particle . Dynamin , possibly in conjunction with actin , mediates fission of the virus - containing pit , and clathrin is uncoated . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1000394 . g008 Clathrin and Actin - Dependent VSV Entry PLoS Pathogens | www . plospathogens . org 10 April 2009 | Volume 5 | Issue 4 | e1000394 of VSV through a clathrin / actin - independent route can explain the successful infection of cytoD - treated MDCK cells , and future direct imaging studies could establish the entry route . What regulates actin polymerization during VSV entry is uncertain . However , we did not observe global changes in the actin cytoskeleton during viral entry , indicating that this must occur locally . Perhaps a physical association between components of the actin and clathrin machineries regulates local actin polymerization during virus uptake . One possible candidate that could provide this association is dynamin , which contains binding sites for several proteins that directly or indirectly activate the Arp2 / 3 complex , including cortactin [ 31 , 32 ] , syndapin [ 33 , 34 ] , and intersectin [ 35 , 36 ] . Consistent with this possibility , the recruitment of dynamin is coincident with the recruitment of cortactin during the late stages of virus internalization ( Figures 3 , 5 ) . Further investigation will be required to fully understand the requirement for actin function during VSV entry . VSV induces its own uptake by clathrin - coated pits Transferrin and LDL - receptor complexes diffuse rapidly on the plasma membrane prior to their capture by pits , which constitutively sample areas of the cell surface [ 1 ] . Here we measured the diffusion of VSV particles and show that they diffuse 60 times slower than LDL - receptor complexes ( Figure 7B ) . However , the 122 s average time between binding of VSV to the cell and its capture by a pit is only 6 - fold longer than the measured time to capture LDL [ 1 ] . Using a simulation that accurately predicts the average capture time of LDL as 20 s , we estimate that random capture of VSV requires 2000 s ( Figure 7C ) . How might we account for this substantial difference between the predicted and observed time to VSV capture ? We tested how adjusting the parameters used in our simulation , which accurately predicts the time for LDL capture , would alter the predicted time to VSV capture . Biologically relevant adjustments to the rate of virus diffusion or the density of pit formation on the plasma membrane are unable to generate a predicted time to virus capture that is close to the measured value of 122 s ( Figure S2A ) . Our data further show that the difference between the observed and predicted time to capture does not reflect the time taken to visualize a coated pit . If we assume that most conventional clathrin - coated vesicles contain 60 clathrin triskelions ( consistent with a soccer ball shape ) , the peak fluorescence associated with such vesicles indicates that 7 triskelia are sufficient for detection . The average lifetime of a conventional vesicle is 50 seconds , indicating that pits may initiate up to 6 seconds before we can visualize them . Finally , adjustments to the assumed footprint of the virus on the plasma membrane ranging from the area contacted by a single G trimer to the entire virus particle cannot account for the rapid virus uptake ( Figure S2B ) . Thus , adjusting any of the parameters of our simulation fails to approximate the observed time to virus uptake . We therefore propose that VSV induces its own uptake by the clathrin machinery . Precisely how VSV particles can influence pit nucleation is unknown . Earlier studies measured the time between attachment and capture for reovirus [ 1 ] and influenza A virus [ 9 ] particles by coated pits . Influenza particles were captured after an average of 190 s , while reovirus remained on the cell membrane for 280 – 1500 s before associating with clathrin . Although the basis for the different uptake times of these viruses is unknown , it may reflect properties inherent to the virus particles themselves or the engagement of specific receptors during entry . Model for the clathrin and actin - dependent internalization of VSV Our data support the following model of VSV entry by clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( Figure 8B ) . Virus interaction with the cell surface promotes its own uptake by the clathrin machinery . The clathrin machinery appears to nucleate in close proximity or directly beneath the virus particle . The coated pit grows at a steady rate that is similar to a conventional one , except that the growth phase is prolonged , perhaps reflecting the larger size of the viral cargo . We suggest that the clathrin coat is unable to encircle completely the virus particle , at least in part because the virus serves as physical barrier to closing the pit . This inhibits the incorporation of additional clathrin molecules into the coat leading to the formation of a partially coated structure with an elongated neck ( Figure 8B ) . We propose that actin polymerization facilitates the invagination of this partially coated pit by generating a force that helps lift the membrane away from the vesicle or pushes the vesicle into the cell ( Figure 8B ) . The process of scission may be accomplished by a mechanochemical activity of dynamin . More dynamin may be required for this process , and consistent with this idea , virus - containing pits recruit increased quantities of dynamin . The separated pit is then rapidly uncoated in a manner that depends upon auxilin and appears similar to that of conventional vesicles . Parallels with the clathrin - dependent uptake of bacteria Our findings with VSV also share parallels with the clathrin - dependent uptake of L . moncytogenes . Specifically , clathrin , dynamin , auxilin , and actin are recruited during entry of both pathogens , and actin polymerization is critical for their endocytosis but not the clathrin assembly process [ 11 , 37 ] . In addition , localization of the actin machinery to sites of Listeria invasion appears to require the prior recruitment of clathrin and dynamin [ 11 ] . The nature of this linkage between the clathrin and actin systems is unknown , but perhaps VSV and Listeria also utilize similar mechanisms to coordinate actin polymerization during their uptake [ 11 , 37 ] . Despite these commonalities , the adaptor protein involved in L . monocytogenes entry is unclear , as neither AP - 1 , - 2 , nor - 3 accumulate [ 11 ] . This may reflect differences in receptor usage or differences inherent to the clathrin structure that forms . Our observations demonstrate a requirement for the actin machinery in the clathrin - dependent uptake of VSV . It will be important to determine if linkage of coated pits to the actin cytoskeleton is a general response of cells to the presence of large clathrin - coated structures or whether the interaction is triggered in a receptor - specific manner . Bacterial pathogens such as L . monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus induce recruitment of the clathrin machinery through the interaction of bacterial surface proteins with their cognate cellular receptors [ 11 ] . Whether viruses share this capacity is unknown , but several viruses , including SV40 [ 38 ] , poliovirus [ 39 , 40 ] , group B coxsackievirus [ 41 ] , and vaccinia virus [ 42 ] are known to promote their own uptake in a clathrin - independent manner .

Parental BSC - 1 cells or BSC - 1 cells stably expressing rat s 2 - adaptin [ 1 ] were transfected with 0 . 5 m g of plasmid encoding either rat brain clathrin light chain A1 fused to the tandem repeat tomato open reading frame ( tom - LCa , [ 4 ] ) , or rat dynamin2 - eGFP ( kind gift of Dr .

Cells were imaged 20 – 24 h post - transfection as described below . Where indicated , prior to image acquisition , cells were doubly transfected with 200 nM of SMARTpool siRNA targeting firefly luciferase ( siGENOME non - targeting siRNA pool # 2 ; D - 001210 - 02 - 05 ; Dharmacon , Chicago , IL ) or a RNA duplex targeting human m 2 - adaptin [ 18 ] in OPTIMEM ( Gibco , Invitrogen Corporation ) using Oligofectamine ( Invitrogen Corporation ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Six hours after each transfection , DMEM containing 10 % FBS was added to each sample , and cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 u C . The efficiency of m 2 depletion was assessed by exposing cells to 50 m g ml 2 1 Alexa 568 - labeled human transferrin ( Molecular Probes , Invitrogen Corporation ) for 5 min . prior to addition of virus particles . Viral gene expression assay Luciferase assays were performed in 96 - well plates ( PerkinEl - mer ) seeded with 8 , 000 cells per well 16 – 18 h before infection . Where indicated , cells were treated with siRNA or specific chemical inhibitors . Cells were then infected with rVSV - LUC at an MOI of 0 . 5 , and virus was removed after 1 h . At 4 – 5 h p . i . , luminescence was measured using Steady - Glo firefly luciferase reagent ( Promega ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The luminescence values were recorded on a MicroBeta TriLux scintillation counter ( PerkinElmer ) . Electron microscopy BSC - 1 cells on 25 mm plastic coverslips were fixed as described previously [ 49 ] . Briefly , cells were inoculated with 20 m M cytoD in DMEM containing 10 % FBS or left untreated for 10 min . at 37 u C . Cells were inoculated in the presence or absence of compound with rVSV at an MOI of 5000 and incubated for an additional 15 min . Infected cells were fixed with a 37 u C solution of 1 % glutaraldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) , 0 . 5 mg / mL saponin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , and 2 mg / mL tannic acid ( Mallinckrodt Inc . ; St Louis , MO ) in 100 mM sodium phosphate , 50 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , pH 7 . 0 ( Buffer A ) for 30 min . at RT . Fixed cells were rinsed twice with Buffer A at pH 6 . 0 and treated with 1 % osmiumtetroxide ( OsO4 ) + 1 . 5 % potassiumferrocyanide ( KFeCN 6 ) for 30 min . Treated samples were washed in water , stained in 1 % aqueous uranyl acetate for 30 min . , and dehydrated in grades of alcohol ( 50 % , 70 % , 95 % , 2 6 100 % ) for 5 min . each . After the dehydration , excess alcohol was blotted off on a filter paper , and the cover slips were immediately covered with a thin layer of Epon and left to polymerize at 60 u C overnight . After polymerization , the plastic coverslip was peeled off and the embedded cells were glued onto a resin block and sectioned . Ultrathin sections ( about 60 – 80 nm ) were cut on a Reichert Ultracut - S microtome , picked up on to copper grids stained with uranylacetate and lead citrate . Images were acquired using a G2 Spirit Bio Twin ( Fei , Hillsboro , OR ) transmission electron microscope . Live cell imaging Cells on 25 mm coverslips were placed into a perfusion chamber and overlayed with a - MEM lacking phenol red supplemented with 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 and 2 % FBS . The chamber was placed into a sample holder ( 20 / 20 Technology Inc . ; Wilmington , NC ) kept at 37 u C , and the humidified air above the cells was maintained at 37 u C and 5 % CO 2 . To image virus internalization , cells were inoculated with Alexa Fluor 647 rVSV or rVSV eGFP - P at a MOI of , 500 following brief centrifugation of the virus stock to eliminate aggregates . Direct visual inspection of virus particles in the stock confirmed a lack of such aggregates and presence of single , isolated viral particles ( Figure S1B ) . Samples were sequentially illuminated at 2 – 8 s intervals for 50 – 150 ms using the previously described laser and confocal microscope configuration [ 1 , 50 ] . Image and data analysis Virus entry and coated pit formation were analyzed using Slidebook 4 . 2 ( Intelligent Imaging Innovations ; Denver , CO ) . Complete virus internalization events were defined by an initial absence of adaptor or clathrin , followed by the colocalization of coat proteins with a particle and detectable displacement of the virion from its original position after coat disassembly . Only complete internalization events were included in the analyses of pit lifetime , kinetics of coat protein recruitment , and protein abundance deduced from fluorescence intensity of the tagged proteins . The following events were excluded from these analyses : ( 1 ) events in which coat proteins colocalized with virus prior to the start or were still associated at the end of a time - lapse acquisition ; ( 2 ) events in which particles moved rapidly during colocalization with clathrin ( endosomal virions ) or failed to move after its disappearance ; and ( 3 ) events in which the fluorescence of another clathrin structure collided with a virus - containing pit . Figure S3 summarizes the relative frequencies of all events analyzed in this study . Conventional coated vesicles were identified and analyzed based on previously - defined spatial and kinetic parameters [ 1 , 4 , 51 ] . The rate of coated pit nucleation ( Figure 7 ) and the efficiency of pit completion in the presence and absence of cytoD and latB ( Figure 6C ) were estimated using an automated image analysis application ( IMAB ) created with MATLAB 7 ( Math - works ; Natick , MA ) [ 4 ] . Images were processed and analyzed as above , and all events were verified manually . SigmaPlot 8 . 0 Clathrin and Actin - Dependent VSV Entry PLoS Pathogens | www . plospathogens . org 12 April 2009 | Volume 5 | Issue 4 | e1000394 ( SYSTAT ; Point Richmond , CA ) was used to plot data and perform statistical analyses . Movies were created using ImageJ ( U . S . National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Maryland ; http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ) . To define the position of a particle over time , a mask encompassing the virion was manually applied to each time - lapse image and centered on the peak fluorescence intensity of the virus - associated dye . The X , Y coordinates of the mask centroid were used to calculate the particle displacement at any new position ( X n , Y n ) relative to the origin of virus attachment ( X 0 , Y 0 ) according to the equation : displacement = ( X n 2 X 0 ) + ( Y n 2 Y 0 ) . The rate of particle displacement was estimated by plotting the square of the mean displacement versus time , and the diffusion coefficient ( D ) was calculated using the relationship : ( mean displacement ) 2 = 4Dt . The fluorescence intensity of coat - associated proteins was measured by applying a mask that encompassed the pit fluorescence . Local background was subtracted by measuring the fluorescence associated with an equal number of pixels . To obtain the fluorescent traces of individual viral events , values were scaled relative to the average maximal fluorescence of clathrin observed in pits lacking virus from the same cells . The normalized values were graphed as a weighted average of every third value , where 60 % was applied to the median value and 20 % to each adjacent value . Comparative plots of the internalization lifetime and protein recruitment kinetics were generated in the following manner : ( 1 ) the fluorescence intensity of each protein was averaged over time for all pits containing or lacking virus ; ( 2 ) the average maximum fluorescence and total lifetime of clathrin in pits lacking virus was set to 100 ; ( 3 ) both parameters were normalized proportionally for virus - containing pits ; ( 4 ) the protein fluorescence was plotted at 8 equally - spaced intervals + / 2 the standard error . Estimation of vesicle surface area The surface area ( SA ) of spherical vesicles was estimated based on their internal radius ( r ) , according to the equation : SA = 4 p r 2 , or for a prolate spheroid with a polar radius ( c ) and an equatorial radius ( a ) using the equation : SA = 2 p a 2 + 2 p ( ac / e ) sin 2 1 e , where the ellipticity ( e ) = ! 1 2 ( a 2 / c 2 ) . Monte - Carlo simulation of virus capture MATLAB 7 ( Mathworks ) was used to simulate the random motion of a VSV particle on a grid of 100 6 100 points . Assuming a specific distance between the grid points dg ( in nm ) , the time ( t s ) required for the particle to move between points was estimated from t s = a ( dg ) 2 / 4D , where D is the VSV diffusion coefficient ( Figure 7B ; 1 6 10 2 11 cm 2 s 2 1 ) , dg is the distance between two neighboring grid points , and a is a correction factor derived from calibration of the simulation . Each simulation was performed using 2 . 5 s step intervals . The number of coated pits in the first step was estimated as follows : ( rate of pit formation ) 6 ( pit lifetime ) 6 ( 100 6 dg ) 2 . The number of new pits in each step was calculated by ( rate of pit formation ) 6 ( ts ) 6 ( 100 6 dg ) 2 . Using these parameters , a VSV particle with a footprint equal to 120 6 120 nm 2 was allowed to diffuse on the grid until it encountered a coated pit , and the elapsed time between the start of the simulation and particle capture was recorded for 100 particles . The average rate of pit nucleation ( 0 . 6 events per 10 8 nm 2 s 2 1 ; total 703 events ) was measured in the presence of VSV for 6 cells expressing s 2 - eGFP . IMAB [ 4 ] was used to identify and score all AP - 2 spots that appeared during an imaging time course and exclude those that lasted fewer than 2 consecutive time points ( 6 – 8 s ) .
