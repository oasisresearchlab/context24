Laboratory findings have never been so 28 rapidly made available to common public and authorities . Experimental data on COVID - 19 29 from across the globe was directly made accessible worldwide . The second wave of the 30 pandemic in India caused unprecedented havoc and it can be stated that all the knowledge 31 of the game of transmission of COVID - 19 acquired and shared was not played with right 32 precision and preparations . Rapid spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 33 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) in the second phase made us rethink if the choice of information given to the 34 common people pertaining to the selective transmission restriction pathways with pressing 35 concern on lethality were inadequate . Most of the governmental and non - governmental 36 organizations ( NGOs ) including the World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommended droplet - 37 based and airborne transmission restrictions as the major steps to control rapid spread of the 38 virus . While , no caution was advised for other plausible pathways like sewage , wastewater - 39 based and non - ventilated indoor air - based transmissions , which are still unknown or not well 40 investigated , and are equally dangerous . The main focus of this article is to analyse the past 41 development about SARS - CoV - 2 transmission pathway related recommendation ( s ) provided 42 by WHO and track the trajectory to alert all the concerning stakeholders and policymakers to 43 rethink and to collect adequate scientific data before they recommend or neglect any specific 44 or all the possible transmission pathways to control the spread of infectious agents further . 45 Keywords : SARS - CoV - 2 ; Temporal Variation ; WBE ; Worldwide ; WWTPs ; Airborne 46 transmission . 47 Introduction 48 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 COVID - 19 had detrimental effect on billions of individuals globally . Restraining the virus from 49 further spreading requires a better understanding of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . Thorough 50 understanding of the transmission capabilities of the virus , after a year and half since the 51 onset of the pandemic , has once again become crucial to assess its true potential [ 1 ] . Although 52 globally followed isolation among the population do have a potential of restricting the spread 53 of the disease , its effectivity lies in the detection of asymptomatic infected individuals [ 2 ] . 54 Therefore , isolation should also be followed by rapid contact tracing and clinical testing . There 55 are several documented modes of SARS - CoV - 2 virus transmission including fomites , aerosols , 56 droplets , etc . Here , we are trying to explore other plausible routes of transmission that can 57 lead to further spreading of the virus . Further , referring to very popular proverbs viz . , 58 “ Prevention and protection is better than cure ” and “ It is definitely better to be safe than to 59 be sorry ” , until extensive research data nullifies or ascertains pathways of transmission , we 60 believe that all the probable routes / modes should be considered and relevant guidelines 61 should be formulated which can be updated upon availability of newer data . In order to get a 62 better understanding of the various transmission channels and the probable dynamics SARS - 63 CoV - 2 has been compared to its counterpart viruses [ 3 ] . 64 65 This current pandemic clearly showed us that one directional thinking and approach can 66 become our deficiency in identifying , understanding and analyzing / estimating all the risks , 67 routes and impact related to SARS - CoV - 2 transmission which , created and aided the already 68 devastating pandemic state of affairs . Neglecting any / many specific modes of transmission of 69 such pernicious diseases can lead to dreadful denouement worldwide . Thus , the main aim of 70 this article is to sensitize the public , all the stakeholders and policy makers universally to 71 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 recognize all potential mode for transmission of highly contagious and deadly diseases 72 through rigorous investigations beforehand and formulation of simple strict regulations for 73 public health safety . 74 75 Modes of Transmission ( Confirmed ) 76 There are currently three confirmed modes of transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 that are known 77 and verified : a ) direct contact with infected individuals and surfaces ( fomites ) b ) large size 78 respiratory droplets , and c ) small ( airborne ) aerosols [ 4 ] . The airborne transmission of the 79 virus is still getting studied rigorously with new research techniques and results uncovering 80 various new aspects about it . As per traditional understanding , it involves the inhalation of 81 infectious aerosols or droplets smaller than 5 µm coming from a distance of more than 1 to 2 82 m from the infected individual [ 5 ] . A few studies have detected SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in air using 83 Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) testing [ 6 ] . The RNA concentration ranged from 2 . 9 copies / L 84 ( patient room ) [ 7 ] , 2 . 6 copies / L ( isolation room ) [ 8 ] , 0 . 02 copies / L ( washroom ) , to 0 . 03 85 copies / L ( Personal Protection Equipment ( PPE ) removal room [ 9 ] . The other modes of 86 transmission such as particles from wastewater discharge point , wastewater sprinklers , direct 87 exposure during wastewater sampling / handling , public washrooms , etc . , need to be 88 investigated in a comprehensive manner , as are being done for air - borne transmission , to get 89 the complete picture about how the virus is spreading in different environments . This , in turn , 90 will enable us to come up with more effective prevention measures and effective guidelines . 91 Modes of Transmission ( Theories ) 92 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 Figure 1 shows that the extent of deadliness and contaminating efficacy of COVID - 19 virus is 93 much lesser than other life - threatening diseases . However , the transmission capacity of SARS - 94 CoV - 2 seems higher than causal microbes of those diseases . Thus , there must be other 95 possible transmission route of SARS - CoV - 2 virus . Some of the routes of transmission may 96 include fecal - oral and bio - aerosols ( pollution to human ) transmissions [ 10 - 11 ] [ Anand et al . , 97 2022 ] Even though , these pathways are not well investigated and are at a speculative juncture 98 now , they cannot be ignored / totally discarded , solely based on the lack of concrete evidence 99 [ 12 ] for safety . Accumulating and analyzing evidence from the current pandemic and previous 100 outbreaks , it can be postulated that wastewater and other aquatic environments can be a 101 potential transmission media / route for the virus [ 9 ] . However , collecting data and gathering 102 knowledge is a time taking process and therefore , even if the chances are remote , the 103 possibility of such transmission pathways shouldn’t be ignored as it can put precious life at 104 risk . Further , more resistant and infectious mutations of SARS - CoV - 2 may appear when 105 mediated by contact with wastewater [ 13 ] . SARSCoV - 2 and other infections may be able to 106 survive in wastewater plumbing systems ( faecal aerosol transmission ) , according to new 107 findings [ 14 ] 108 109 While hand cleanliness is important in avoiding faecal - oral ( through contact with respiratory 110 mucosa ) transmission , boosting bathroom ventilation and running faucets occasionally to 111 keep U - trap water seals from drying out , especially in high - rise buildings , may also assist . 112 However as per WHO directives , there are no significant evidence of COVID - 19 spreading 113 through contaminated water as the virus is more quickly inactivated in the presence of high 114 temperature , oxidants , and other disinfectants [ 15 ] . A study by Wölfel et al . , [ 16 ] also adds to 115 the growing body of data suggesting infectious SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in faeces is 116 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 uncommon , if it happens at all , and that fecal - oral transmission is unlikely to be a key mode 117 of virus transmission . Patients with COVID - 19 often face diarrhoea , vomiting , nausea , and 118 stomach discomfort , which can occasionally forego respiratory symptoms . SARS - CoV - 2 virus 119 RNA has been identified in stool samples of COVID - 19 patients in a number of investigations , 120 sometimes at extremely high levels . While this indicates that the virus may infect cells in the 121 gastrointestinal system , it should not be mistaken with the residence of the viable or 122 infectious virus in faeces or the possibility of fecal - oral transmission . This notion will have to 123 wait for larger - scale experiments to be confirmed . 124 125 As per air transmission route is studied , it transformed into a more complicated phenomena 126 with the availability of more research data and development of the aerosol transmission 127 theory , there could be possibility of virus stability in air for a longer distance and longer 128 duration depending upon the host - particle size and meteorological conditions . A study set up 129 to validate the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 using ferret model concluded that the viral 130 particles transmission occurred over more than 1 m through air [ 17 ] . This ‘through - air’ 131 transport of virus - laden particles can be attributed to the dominance of air currents on 132 smaller droplets compared to the gravitational force . Ambient particle ( aerosols ) size ranges 133 from a few nanometers ( nm ) to several micrometers ( µm ) with the highest residence time 134 ( about a week ) of the accumulation mode particles ( 0 . 1 to 1 µm ) . Further , smaller particles ( < 135 1 µm ) are relatively much more in number / concentration compared to bigger particles ( > 2 136 µm ) . Also , accumulation mode particles also have larger surface area , suggesting that these 137 particles can be a good host for supporting viruses . Any virus that once attaches to a particle 138 surface can travel over long distances along with the particle ( up to thousands of km , in 139 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 principle ) . Ambient meteorological conditions such as wind speed and direction , relative 140 humidity , temperature , etc . also play an important role in particle ’ s transport . These droplets 141 can travel through 10s of meters depending on the above - mentioned parameters [ 3 , 18 ] . 142 Further , particles with less than 10 µm ( aerodynamic diameter ) are inhalable , and even finer 143 particles ( < 1 µm ) have deeper reach in the lungs ( lower respiratory tract ) [ 19 ] . The 144 aerodynamic analysis of SARS - CoV - 2 and SARS - CoV - 1 illustrates that both can spread through 145 air [ 20 ] . Similar characteristics were shown by Influenza and Norwalk virus following air 146 transmission route to infect ferrets and children [ 21 , 22 ] . 147 148 149 Fig 1 : Comparative contamination efficacy and deadliness of different diseases ( Adapted 150 from The Microbe Scope : https : / / informationisbeautiful . net / visualizations / the - 151 microbescope - infectious - diseases - in - context / ) 152 153 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 The next most conjectured transmission route of the virus is through water and wastewater 154 [ 13 ] [ 23 ] . Contamination via sewage and wastewater is a potential transmission route that 155 needs to be analyzed and studied meticulously . Recent reports indicated that the Coronavirus 156 can survive for days in wastewater and even longer in drinking water [ 24 , 25 ] . It can 157 contaminate the drinking water supply through leakage in the pipeline or in low disinfectants 158 conditions . The aerosol generated from those contaminated water resources can infect 159 human [ 24 , 26 ] . The presence of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in fecal matter of COVID - 19 positive patients 160 for long duration indicates the possibility of presence of viable viral particles in 161 wastewater / greywater [ 19 , 27 - 29 ] . Wastewater data from more than 11 countries reported 162 to contain SARS - CoV - 2 RNA . Thus , water related activities like swimming , fishing , 163 canoeing / rowing , and shower can generate aerosols that contains live vial particles and infect 164 new hosts [ 30 ] . Apart from this , the spread of infection might also occur through aerosols 165 being generated during the investigation of these aqueous matrices [ 13 ] , boarding flights , 166 physical gatherings , and meetings , exposure to body fluids , visiting dentist clinics and 167 hospitals , intrapartum , etc . This highlights the necessity for a risk assessment and 168 management framework specialized to SARS - CoV - 2 transmission via wastewater , as well as 169 new environmental surveillance techniques and proper disinfection as part of the broader 170 COVID - 19 pandemic containment strategy [ 31 ] . 171 172 A study on the viability of SARS - CoV - 2 virus in river water and wastewater ( filtered and un - 173 filtered sample ) at two different temperatures of 4 and 24 ⁰ C , generated concern about the 174 infectious nature of the virus , as it was viable longer in filtered sample and low temperature 175 [ 23 ] . Pathogens that are detected and known to have certain amount of health risk ( s ) , 176 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 transmissible through wastewater are Adeno , Astro , Hepatitis , Rota , Noro , and few Entero 177 viruses [ 25 , 26 , 32 – 35 ] . Various studies have documented the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 in 178 wastewater [ 13 ] [ 23 - 25 ] . In countries with higher infection rates , consideration of this 179 additional transmission channel might just become a significant event as a certain ( infectious ) 180 portion of the virus might be still viable [ 36 ] . Countries with overburdened Wastewater 181 Treatment Plants ( WWTPs ) and low sanitation strategies should follow precautionary 182 measures until data on infectivity is obtained from a large number of sample analyses globally 183 [ 36 ] . 184 185 According to the WHO , the existing drinking water disinfection technique could efficiently 186 inactivate most of the bacterial and viral populations found in water , particularly SARS - CoV - 2 187 ( more sensitive to disinfectant like free chlorine ) . Only one research has established that 188 SARS - CoV - 2 infectivity in water for humans is nil , based on the lack of cytopathic effect ( CPE ) 189 in infectivity assays . As a result , more research should be done to see how long SARS - CoV - 2 190 may survive in water and wastewater under various operational settings ( such as temperature 191 and water matrix ) and if COVID - 19 - contaminated water can transmit to humans . Although 192 paper - based devices for detecting SARS - CoV - 2 residues in water have been suggested , 193 procedures and adequate devices need be developed shortly [ 37 ] . 194 195 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 196 Figure 2 : Compilation of COVID - 19 transmission route including WHO directives 197 ( https : / / www . who . int / news / item / 29 - 06 - 2020 - covidtimeline , last accessed on 20 / 11 / 2021 ) 198 199 Transmission in public and private spaces 200 The airborne transmission can be a very serious issue in case of poorly ventilated indoor 201 environments . This form of infection can result in clusters of cases from a small area in a short 202 period of time [ 38 , 39 ] . A recent study showed infectious rate of 16 . 3 % from an index patient 203 to a healthy individual in the same household [ 40 ] . Age and spousal relationship were the key 204 factors in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission inside the household [ 41 ] . Another study indicates the 205 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 11 transmission of virus from index patients in one apartment to healthy individuals in other 206 apartments through airflow in pipes [ 40 ] . Closed indoor areas ( eg . 207 Rooms / elevators / shops / restaurants / airconditioned premises ) with improper ventilation and 208 contaminated drainage systems might accelerate the transmission [ 3 ] . 209 210 India’s 2 nd Wave ( Possible Reasons ) 211 The impactful 2 nd COVID wave has infected millions and claimed lives of thousands alone in 212 the month of April , 2021 . Our study has cumulated all other studies till now suggesting 213 possible reasons for this massive outbreak : I ) Studies on already antibody - prevalent 214 individuals showed that only 7 out of 100 people have antibodies - prevalence at present . This 215 indicates that the existence of antibodies ranges only between 3 - 6 months in majority of 216 population [ 42 ] . II ) The new variant B . 1 . 617 ( Delta ) on grounds of B . 1 . 1 . 7 ( Alpha or UK - 217 Variant ) and B . 1 . 351 ( Beta , South - Africa Variant ) was detected as VOCs ( Variant of Concern ) . 218 Details genetic analysis of these VOCs indicted a dual mutation in spike proteins and RNA 219 polymerase genes that makes these variant more transmittable than the wild - types . B . 1 . 617 220 infects and colonizes the lower respiratory tract , making the disease more persistent and 221 severe . This emerging mutated delta variant manifesting higher pathogenicity and 222 transmissibility [ 42 , 43 ] , was present in most of the samples tested in Maharashtra , India [ 44 ] . 223 III ) Besides the contagious double mutant variant , the other reasons were the population’s 224 negligent behavior ( in wearing protective N - 95 masks in public places , inattentiveness 225 towards following strict COVID protocols ) , certain relaxations from lockdown for smooth 226 functioning of day to day lives [ 45 ] , population size and density / distribution and lack of proper 227 awareness especially in rural regions . IV ) The fourth reason which , is suggested earlier in the 228 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 article , is the airborne transmission of the mutated variant ( s ) , applicable over a larger area 229 and longer duration . V ) With the grand successful vaccination campaign in the country , 230 keenness to keep following the COVID protocols faded and the awareness about the fact that 231 not all variants ( also future mutations ) might be sensitive to the vaccines was rare . 232 233 It is well established that on inhalation , coarse particles ( > 1 µm ) are trapped in the nasal and 234 trachea region whereas , finer particles ( 1 nm to 1 µm ) can reach deeper into the lungs 235 ( alveolar region ) [ 46 ] . Virus residing fine aerosols could reach directly to the deeper parts of 236 human lungs and affect the lungs ( might be a possible reason for many cases of negative RT - 237 PCR test report but corona positive in the 2 nd wave ) . The virus riding very small particles ( < 100 238 nm ) can penetrate through the epithelial cells to the blood stream , and in principle can reach 239 any part of the body . This might be amongst possible causes of many happy hypoxia cases in 240 the 2 nd wave . Poorly ventilated indoor places such as schools , cinema halls , auditoriums , 241 shopping malls , food plazas , etc . with asymptomatically infected individuals and higher 242 abundance of fine aerosols can be a big source of the uncontrolled spread [ 47 ] . 243 244 Figure 2 indicates WHO’s directive with the timeline on COVID - 19 transmission of VoCs and 245 the various direct and indirect routes . It took about five months to develop the timeline of 246 transmission pathways ( Figure 2 ) , and more extensive ground research is needed to 247 extend / branch the timeline further . Proper communication and monitoring of all these 248 pathways at the very beginning of the pandemic would have resulted in more effective 249 systems in controlling the COVID - 19 transmission and related fatalities . Thus , it is proposed 250 that all the related stakeholders and the controlling bodies should not neglect any of the 251 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 13 possible disease transmission pathways unless until it has been proven to be non - 252 transmissible scientifically with valid and sufficient data . Rapid mutation of SARS - CoV genes 253 makes it difficult to understand the exact mode ( s ) of transmissions due to lack of related data . 254 255 Recently , Omicron and Delta variants showed much more infectivity and transmission ability 256 than all of the previous variants even though their clinical symptoms manifested were 257 different . There are not enough data on how mutation ( s ) in certain genes makes some 258 variants ( e . g . , Omicron ) much more infectious while other variants ( e . g . , Delta ) much lethal 259 than the parent virus or other strains . Data on population ( demography ) susceptibility and 260 geological location effect on the occurrence , spread and persistence of the disease are also 261 not established fundamentally . Also , the virus shedding in vaccinated populations and their 262 variations with types of vaccines used are not established profoundly . Thus , a dedicated and 263 efficient surveillance system for all types of transmission mode should be developed to 264 generate enough data sets for quick identification of the right modes for transmission for any 265 such disease ( s ) . Based on these data , standard procedures must be ascertained such as 266 suggestion to continue to wear only surgical ( use and throw ) followed by N - 95 masks , 267 precaution rules to be aware of and careful handling / dealing with water and wastewater , 268 continuation of wearing of PPE gowns and gears for flight travels , maintaining COVID rules in 269 public places , etc . , could be sectioned into established guidelines and 270 precautionary / preventive measures for public health safety . 271 272 Conclusion 273 274 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 14 The current study provides a collective analysis from various studies around the world on 275 COVID - 19 disease and its transmission . The 2 nd pandemic wave has proven to be fatal 276 globallyand the far - reaching consequences of this were particularly evident in India . During 277 these times , when studies on majorly two of the transmission routes of SARS - CoV - 2 are 278 confirmed , the possibility of transmission through other routes should not be ignored , until 279 discarded with scientific proof . As the negative reported studies on these probable routes are 280 from a definite number of datasets , the infectious nature of virus can still prevail via these 281 lesser studied routes . Hence , there is an urgent need for risk assessment and management 282 framework customized for SARS - CoV - 2 transmission via different pathways . In the present 283 manuscript , an effort has been made to accumulate the collective knowledge of these studies 284 along with our own theory and help researchers and policyholders to be more precautionary 285 about the possible COVID transmissions . 286 Notes : 287 The authors declare no competing financial interest . 288 Acknowledgement : 289 This work is funded by Sustainability Cluster of UPES . 290 References 291 1 . * * * Kucharski A , Russell T , Diamond C , Liu Y , Edmunds J , Funk S , Eggo MR , Early dynamics of 292 transmission and control of COVID - 19 : a mathematical modelling study .
