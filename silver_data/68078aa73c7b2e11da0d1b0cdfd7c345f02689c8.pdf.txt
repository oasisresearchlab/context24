Abstract A cell ’ s ability to establish polarization is one of the key steps in directional migration . Upon the addition of a chemoattractant , N - formylmethionyl - leucyl - phenylalanine ( fMLP ) , neutrophils rapidly develop a front end marked by a wide and dense actin network which is a feature of cell polarization . Despite a general understanding of bi - directional crosstalk between endocytosis and polarization , it remains unclear how clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) induced by chemoattractant binding to formyl peptide receptor ( FPR ) a ﬀ ects neutrophil polarization . In this work , we characterized the spatial organization of FPR and clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) , the functional unit of CME , with and without fMLP and found that fMLP induced di ﬀ erent distributions of FPR and CCPs . We further found that cells had impaired polarization induced by fMLP when CME is inhibited by small molecule inhibitors . Under these conditions , pERK , pAkt 308 , and pAkt 473 were all severely blocked or had altered dynamics . The spatial organization between actin and two major clathrin - mediated endocytic proteins , clathrin and b - arrestin , were distinct and supported clathrin and b - arrestin ’ s functional roles in mediating neutrophil polarization .

Keyword : Cell biology 1 . Introduction Within tens of seconds to several minutes upon binding of N - formylmethionyl - leucyl - phenylalanine ( fMLP ) to formyl peptide receptors ( FPR ) , neutrophils rapidly establish polarity , with lamellipodia protruding in the front and a long tail at the back . Many molecular e ﬀ ectors involved in this process are known [ 1 ] , including the ones that mediate G protein and arrestin signaling [ 2 ] . Like most G protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) , agonist binding to FPR triggers receptor internalization from the plasma membrane to intracellular compartments [ 3 ] . Although bi - directional interplay between signal transduction and endocytosis is an emerging theme [ 4 , 5 ] , the interplay between fMLP - FPR signaling in the context of neutrophil polarization and endocytosis has not been investigated in detail . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is one of the major endocytic pathways that GPCRs are internalized following ligand binding [ 6 ] . CME has been shown to play an important role in signal transduction mediated by GPCRs . It actively regu - lates the turnover of the receptors on the membrane , thereby governs the amount of signal a cell can receive . CME occurs through the assembly of discrete clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) , and each is a macromolecular assembly that consists of scaf - fold / signaling molecules such as b - arrestin [ 2 ] . Many studies have shown the impor - tance of CME in the establishment of cell polarization . For example , in polarized budding yeast , endocytotic vesicles corral central exocytic zone to establish robust polarity [ 7 ] . In migrating cells , the spatial distribution of CCPs has been a subject of debate . Early electron microscopy studies showed that CCPs appeared to be at the back and almost none at the front lamellipodia [ 8 ] . However , another study observed that CCPs were polarized at the leading edge in migrating Madine Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cells [ 9 ] . Using spinning - disk confocal microscopy and lat - tice light - sheet microscopy , Kural et al . characterized CCP distribution in migrating glioblastoma cells and found spatial di ﬀ erences in CCP dynamics between dorsal and ventral membrane [ 10 ] . In the present work , we aim to investigate the role of CME during the polarization of HL - 60 - derived neutrophil ( hereafter referred to as neutrophil ) . We ﬁ rst quanti ﬁ ed the spatial co - distribution of FPR and CCP in fMLP - stimulated and non - stimulated neutrophils . The phenotype di ﬀ erences in polarization for fMLP - stimulated and non - stimulated cells suggested that CME might be important in neutrophil polarization . We further demonstrated the importance of CME for 2 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . heliyon . 2018 . e00819 2405 - 8440 / (cid:1) 2018 The Authors . Published by Elsevier Ltd .

Both treatments potently blocked neutrophil polarization and fMLP - induced ERK and Akt signaling . Analysis of actin - clathrin and actin - b - arrestin spatial correlation revealed di ﬀ erential interaction between actin cytoskel - eton and endocytic proteins with and without fMLP , suggesting a close - knit relation - ship between CME and FPR signaling during neutrophil polarization . 2 . Results and discussion 2 . 1 . CCPs and FPR spots organize di ﬀ erently in the presence of fMLP To investigate the spatial organization between FPRs and CCPs , we imaged FPRs and CCPs in ﬁ xed HL - 60 derived neutrophils using total internal re ﬂ ection ﬂ uorescence mi - croscopy ( TIR - FM ) without and with uniform 100 nM fMLP after 5 minutes . In a uni - form concentration of fMLP , neutrophils start to polarize with distinctive phenotypes , such as a dramatic increase in cell area , adopting an elongated shape , and formation of polarized signaling molecules and sub - cellular structures within the cell . TIR - FM mi - croscopy uses a thin evanescent excitation ﬁ eld to observe the ventral cell surface , and largely avoids ﬂ uorescence signals from intracellular structures . Besides a signi ﬁ cant increase in cell size , we observed more FPR and CCP puncta and a noticeable greater degree of colocalization in fMLP - treated cells ( Fig . 1A ) . Using Pearson correlation co - e ﬃ cient , a standard colocalization analysis , between the two ﬂ uorescence channels , there was a large variation and an overall smaller mean Pearson correlation coe ﬃ cient for fMLP - treated cells ( Fig . 1B ) . However , this metric only measures the linear rela - tionship between two variables and ignores local structures of the data ; therefore , a more detailed analysis is needed . To investigate this further , CCPs and FPRs puncta were detected using point - source detection software package based on an improved Gaussian mixture model [ 11 ] . We noticed that there was a dramatic increase in the number of CCPs and FPR puncta upon fMLP stimulation and there were more FPR puncta than CCPs under both stim - ulating and non - stimulating conditions . However , not all of the CCPs were associ - ated with FPRs , where we de ﬁ ned the association by the number of FPRs within a 5 - pixel ( w 290 nm ) radius of a CCP . There were w 17 . 3 % of CCPs without FPRs nearby ( vacant CCPs ) for the control condition compared to w 10 . 6 % for the fMLP - treated condition ( Fig . 1C ) . In addition , there were signi ﬁ cantly more CCPs with FPRs ( occupied CCPs ) in the fMLP - treated condition . We next asked whether the increased number of CCPs and FPRs were scattered randomly on the membrane with uniformly distributed intensity and how many FPR puncta were around a CCP . To provide a more comprehensive view of the data , we mapped each individual CCP to a plane where x - axis is the CCP intensity and y - axis is the number of FPR puncta 3 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . heliyon . 2018 . e00819 2405 - 8440 / (cid:1) 2018 The Authors .

From the two scatter plots , it is apparent that the plot for non - stimulation is not a down - sampled version of the plot for fMLP - stimulated condition . Rather , the two conditions had distinct distributions in the three variables presented . In the presence of fMLP , the increase in CCP numbers was not uniform against CCP intensity e there were much more dimmer ( i . e . , log ( CCP intensity ) < 3 ) structures than the brighter ones . Interestingly , it is the dimmer CCP structures where we found more surrounding FPR puncta as well as more FPRs ( i . e . , larger circles ) . While the Fig . 1 .

Article No w e00819 increase in dimmer structures could due to a greater z distance from the imaging plane , fMLP treatment increases neutrophil spreading and this should provide an overall greater attachment to the substrate . The increase in FPR in dimmer CCPs is similar to a ﬁ nding reported recently that short - lived ( i . e . , dim CCPs ) have more epidermal growth factor receptors ( EGFR ) [ 12 ] . This is also consistent with cargo clustering that nucleate de novo CCPs [ 13 ] . Altogether , the above results demonstrated that fMLP stimulation led to an interaction between FPR and CCPs and thus CME is responsive to fMLP stimulation in neutrophils . 2 . 2 . fMLP internalization occurs rapidly in neutrophil To further study endocytosis during neutrophil polarization , we next sought to char - acterize the kinetics of fMLP internalization . An early study quanti ﬁ ed the endocy - tosis rate in polymorphonuclear leukocytes using ﬂ uorescein - dextran and observed a steady increase in intensity over time [ 14 ] . We used FITC - labeled fMLP to track internalization of fMLP over time using ﬂ ow cytometry analysis . Similar to the ca - nonical transferrin uptake assay to quantify the endocytic rate [ 13 ] , we measured the intensity of FITC - fMLP following surface - bound ligand removal . Due to the incom - plete di ﬀ erentiation of some cells , we observed two populations in the FITC channel ( Sup Fig . 1 ) . The peak intensities for two contiguous time points only had small dif - ferences . In this case , using a simple mean or median or any manually picked metrics would fail to quantify the data objectively . Hence , we resorted to a Gaussian mixture model to model the two populations by assuming that the data came from two Gaussian distributions and extracted the larger mean as the “ average intensity ” for that sample . The method has several advantages in this application : 1 . it utilized all the acquired data without manually excluding any data ; 2 . it was able to di ﬀ er - entiate the di ﬀ erence between conditions ; 3 . it was robust across all independent experiments . We observed a canonical endocytic uptake trend for the uptake of fMLP within the ﬁ rst 20 minutes ( Fig . 2A and B ) , similar to that of transferrin receptor ( Sup Fig . 2A ) . It is worth noting that the rate of increase is not uniform in the ﬁ rst 20 min . The rate of increase between 0 min to 2 min was much more distinct than any other time range ( 1 . 43 (cid:2) 0 . 069 a . u . / min ) , and followed by 5 min e 10 min ( 0 . 0237 (cid:2) 0 . 0118 a . u . / min ) . In contrast to previous reported results , we observed a drop in FITC - fMLP intensity at 30 min , following robust internalization at earlier time points . One possible reason is that ligands undergo complex endocytic pathways , along which the ligand - receptors get recycled back to the membrane or degraded within the cells . 2 . 3 . CME is important for neutrophil polarization The association of FPR with CCPs and internalization of fMLP bound FPR following fMLP stimulation suggest that CME might play a role in neutrophil 5 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . heliyon . 2018 . e00819 2405 - 8440 / (cid:1) 2018 The Authors .

Article No w e00819 polarization . To investigate whether CME is essential in neutrophil polarization , we resorted to pharmaceutical perturbations , which acutely and e ﬀ ectively target cell population and do not su ﬀ er from compensation in genetic knockdown experiments . We performed experiments with two of the mostly used inhibitors for CME , Pitstop2 ( that interferes with CCP assembly [ 15 ] ) and Dynasore ( that inhibits vesicle scission [ 16 ] ) . Both of these inhibitors blocked fMLP - induced FPR endocytosis ( Sup Fig . 2B and C ) . Due to the potential o ﬀ - target e ﬀ ects of Pitstop2 that has been reported to block clathrin - independent endocytosis [ 17 , 18 ] , results obtained from using Pit - stop2 are included in supplemental material . It is worth noting that there have also been non - speci ﬁ c e ﬀ ects reported for Dynasore [ 19 , 20 ] . In order to evaluate the ef - fects of endocytosis inhibitors on neutrophil polarization in an objective manner , we used automated imaging and analysis of ﬁ xed cells labeling microtubule , actin , phospho - myosin II ( pMyosinII ) and DAPI ( Fig . 3A and B , Sup Fig . 3A ) . In fMLP - treated cells , actin and microtubule / pMyosinII distinctively localized to the front and rear of a cell , respectively . As it is readily apparent , addition of Pitstop2 and Dynasore abrogated fMLP - induced polarization . To precisely quantify di ﬀ erences in polarization , we extracted three groups of fea - tures from the images : morphology ( C1 and C2 ) , center ( C3 - C5 ) , and intensity ( C6 - C8 ) ( Fig . 3E ) . To avoid possible selection bias , we analyzed about 1000 cells for each condition . Due to the large number of cells imaged , we need a more Fig . 2 . fMLP internalization ﬁ rst increases over time but then decreases . ( A ) Di ﬀ erentiated neutrophils starved for 30 min were treated with 200 nM of FITC - fMLP and fMLP internalization at 0 , 2 min , 5 min , 10 min , 20 min , and 30 min time points were imaged by confocal microscopy . ( B ) fMLP internalization at di ﬀ erent time points were measured by ﬂ ow cytometry ( See Materials andMethods for detailed calcu - lation of ‘ average intensity ’ ) . Each data point for a speci ﬁ c condition in the box plot represents the dif - ference in average intensity between that condition and the control condition ( without internalization ) from a single experiment . A total of 7 independent experiments were performed . 6 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . heliyon . 2018 . e00819 2405 - 8440 / (cid:1) 2018 The Authors . Published by Elsevier Ltd .

Article No w e00819 and D , the data were not drawn from a normal distribution ; therefore , we adopted Kolmogorov - Smirnov ( KS ) test statistics to summarize distributions ( more details can be found in Sup Fig . 4 ) . Using the fMLP stimulation condition as the base , a negative KS score ( in blue ) would mean that the distribution of the measurement shifts to the left compared to fMLP - stimulated cells , and therefore is on average smaller . On the other hand , a positive KS score ( in red ) would mean that the distri - bution shifts to the right , and therefore is on average larger ( Fig . 3E ) . For example , in the case of untreated neutrophils , KS score was negative for cell area but positive for circularity ( circularity ¼ 1 when it is a perfect circle ) ( Fig . 3E and Sup Fig . 3C ) . It is well known neutrophils are smaller and rounder compared to those stimulated with fMLP and our data provides an assuring proof - of - principle for our analysis . Using this analysis , we observed the same pattern for both Pitstop2 and Dynasore - treated neutrophils with and without fMLP . However , Dynasore - treated neutrophils had less negative KS statistics for cell area , indicating that Pitstop2 had a larger e ﬀ ect on morphological phenotype . Besides morphological features , we further measured center and intensity features , denoted as ‘ bright to center ’ and ‘ intensity deviation ’ , that characterized the spatial organization for microtubules , actin and pMyosinII ( Fig . 3D ) . The center feature characterizes how polarized a structure is , and is calculated as the normalized dis - tance ( by the cell diameter ) between the center of an area with 95 % of total intensity pixels within a cell and the centroid of all the pixels within a cell . If the 95 % brightest pixels all concentrate in a small region along the cell edge , then center feature is large . On the contrary , if the brightest pixels are close to the center or around the cell periphery , then the value would be small . For cells without fMLP , we only observed a marginal di ﬀ erence in center features compared to cells stimulated with fMLP ( Fig . 3E ) . For Pitstop2 and Dynasore - treated fMLP stimulated cells , cen - ter features were on average smaller , suggesting that Pitstop2 and Dynasore impaired distribution of actin , microtubule , and pMyosinII ( Fig . 3E and Sup Fig . 3C ) . Inten - sity deviation calculates the standard deviation in ﬂ uorescence intensity within a cell . A small value means a narrower distribution of the intensity , whereas a large value means intensities within a cell are more spread out . Interestingly , for microtubule and actin , our analysis indicated a larger standard deviation but a smaller bright to center distance for cells without fMLP and for cells treated with Pitstop2 or Dyna - sore with or without fMLP . From the ﬂ uorescence images , we could see a bright band of actin and microtubule at the end of a cell in Pitstop2 and Dynasore - treated cells , which explains the large variance , but the distance to the center is not as large compared to the cells treated with fMLP . It is worth pointing out that Dynasore has been shown to a ﬀ ect actin polymerization in a dynamin - independent mechanism [ 22 , 23 ] . However , besides changes in actin assembly , we also found changes in microtubule and pMyosinII , which suggest that this could still be due to Dynasore ’ s e ﬀ ect on endocytosis .

Article No w e00819 CME by Pitstop2 and Dynasore caused disruption of neutrophil polarization . Even though we cannot rule out o ﬀ target e ﬀ ects of these small molecules on the cells [ 18 , 19 , 20 , 24 ] , the ﬁ nding that both small molecule inhibitors targeting endocytosis abrogated neutrophil polarization suggest that CME plays a crucial role in neutrophil polarization . 2 . 4 . Inhibition of CME blocks several signaling pathways Many studies have pointed to the crucial and multi - faceted roles of CME on signaling [ 12 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 ] . Clathrin ’ s role as a sca ﬀ old but not in receptor endo - cytosis is required for Akt 308 phosphorylation upon epidermal growth factor stimu - lation [ 12 , 27 ] . In an analogous way , Eichel et al . revealed that clathrin - coated structures on the plasma membrane are central for b - arrestin signaling of GPCRs [ 29 ] . Conversely , proper CME is important for other signaling pathways , including ERK and mTORC1 signaling [ 12 ] . The importance of endocytosis for downstream signaling has also been found in growth factor signaling to mTORC1 in macro - phages [ 30 ] . Since Pitstop2 and Dynasore both potently blocked fMLP - induced neutrophil polarization , we hypothesize that these inhibitors also block cell signaling . To investigate the downstream signaling e ﬀ ectors of CME , we compared pAkt 308 , pAkt 473 and pERK levels without and with Pitstop / Dynasore in fMLP stim - ulated cells . pAkt 308 , pAkt 473 and pERK covered three major signaling pathways . Speci ﬁ cally , pAkt 308 indicates the activities of protein kinase Akt , which mediates the positive feedback loop between PIP 3 and actin [ 31 ] , pAkt 473 was used as a readout of PIP 3 and mTORC2 activity , and pERK is activated in the MAPK / ERK pathway that is frequently associated with the b - arrestin signaling pathway . Using Western blot analysis , we measured the phosphorylation of pAkt 308 ( Fig . 4A and B , Sup Fig . 5A and B ) , pAkt 473 ( Fig . 4C and D , Sup Fig . 5C and D ) , and pERK ( Fig . 4E and F , Sup Fig . 5E and F ) at various time points between 0 min to 10 min and observed a rapid stimulation which reached its peak within 1 e 2 minutes and gradually decreases . However , all these dynamical changes disappeared when cells were treated with Pitstop2 ( Sup Fig . 5 ) . Pitstop2 blocks CME at the early stage but not the binding of fMLP to FPR . Hence , we could speculate that proper assembly of CCPs is a crucial step in e ﬀ ective signal transduction . It is interesting to note that Dynasore ’ s impact on neutrophil polarization was not as dramatic as that of Pitstop2 ( Fig . 3E and Sup Fig . 3C ) . Here , our signaling analysis showed that the peak inten - sities of pAkt 308 , pAkt 473 , and pERK of cells in the presence of Dynasore were about half compared to untreated cells , which might explain the intermediate phenotype of Dynasore - treated cells . Even though Dynasore - treated cells also reached maximum signaling between 1 and 2 minutes , the subsequent decline of signaling was less e ﬃ - cient . From these results and those in the previous section , we believe that CME in - hibition hindered neutrophil polarization by blocking fMLP - induced signaling . 9 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . heliyon . 2018 . e00819 2405 - 8440 / (cid:1) 2018 The Authors .

Polarized neutrophils have denser and dimmer CCPs at the front The di ﬀ erences between fMLP stimulation and the two small molecule inhibition conditions provide some clues on the role of CME during neutrophil polarization . Signal transduction likely occurs concurrently during CCP formation , invagination , and scission to form clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) . More importantly , the events after CCP scission ( where max signaling is 1 e 2 minutes ) may also aid in neutrophil polarization ( on the order of 5 minutes ) . To gain deeper insights on the relationship Fig . 4 . Inhibition of CME blocks several signaling pathways . Changes of pERK ( A , B ) pAkt 473 ( C , D ) , and pAkt 308 ( E , F ) were quanti ﬁ ed from analysis of cropped Western blots in samples with and without fMLP over time with and without Dynasore . Data in B , D , and F represented mean (cid:2) s . e . m . from three independent experiments . Full Western blots are shown in Sup Fig . 6 . 10 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . heliyon . 2018 . e00819 2405 - 8440 / (cid:1) 2018 The Authors . Published by Elsevier Ltd .

Article No w e00819 of clathrin machinery and signaling sca ﬀ old with neutrophil polarization , we inves - tigated in detail the spatial organization between actin , the prominent structure that marks polarity , and clathrin or b - arrestin , the structural and signaling sca ﬀ olds in CME , respectively . As shown in Fig . 3 , neutrophil polarization is marked by the non - uniform cellular components , such as actin , microtubule , and pMyosinII . However , there have been a number of inconsistent reports on the spatial distribution of CCPs in polarized cells . In 1982 , Davis et al . observed that CCPs were mainly located at the back of polarized neutrophils via transmission electron microscopy [ 8 ] . However , Rappoport and Simon reported that the majority of CCPs were at the leading edge of a migrating cell [ 9 ] . We believe that these incongruent ﬁ ndings may lie in the methods used to observed CCP . From our own experiments , CCPs appear to preferentially localize at the front end of the cells by TIR - FM where the ventral plasma membrane is visual - ized . On the other hand , CCPs appear to be in the middle or at the back of the cell when using confocal or epi - ﬂ uorescence microscopy [ 6 , 32 ] . Here we use TIR - FM for better signal - to - background ratio and more accurate CCP localization . Consistent with previous studies , we also observed polarization in CCP localization . Without fMLP , CCPs were more evenly distributed on the membrane , whereas there was a distinct CCP band well correlated with the lamellipodia in polarized cells ( Fig . 5A ) . As we and others have shown [ 33 ] , fMLP stimulation leads to rapid poly - merization of actin ﬁ laments , as evidenced by an increase in phalloidin - stained actin intensity ( Fig . 5B and C ) . We observed the same trend for CCPs ( Fig . 5D and E ) . There were about 5 times more CCPs and a right shift of intensity distribution in fMLP - stimulated cells , with a slightly higher density . In Fig . 1D and E , we noted that there appeared to be more dimmer CCPs in the presence of fMLP . Here , we indeed observed the CCP intensity distribution was left - skewed with a long tail . However , compared to the cells without fMLP , the CCP median intensity was still higher . With more and brighter CCPs in the presence of fMLP , how were they distributed on the cell membrane ? From the microscopy images , we observed that near the bright actin staining , CCPs also seemed to be denser . To quantify this observation , we calculated the local CCP density and actin intensity for each CCP by drawing a circle centered at it . For actin intensity , we chose a small radius of 5 pixels ( w 290 nm ) to re ﬂ ect local density . For CCP density , we selected a larger radius of 40 pixels ( w 2 . 33 m m ) to capture its spatial organization . We also calculated the average inten - sity for all the CCPs within the circle . Therefore , for each point in Fig . 5F and G , it represents an individual CCP and shows its local CCP density , actin intensity , and the average CCP intensity ( indicated by the size of the point ) . Comparing the cells without fMLP ( Fig . 5F ) and with fMLP ( Fig . 5G ) , we saw a striking di ﬀ erence in CCP distribution and their correlation to actin intensity . Without fMLP , there 11 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . heliyon . 2018 . e00819 2405 - 8440 / (cid:1) 2018 The Authors . Published by Elsevier Ltd .

Article No w e00819 were two distinct populations of CCPs , a larger one with low actin intensity and low CCP density and a second population with higher actin intensity and larger CCP den - sity . This separation completely disappeared with fMLP stimulation . However , we observed that most CCPs resided at the lower triangle of the plane , which means that when actin intensity was low , CCP density was not constrained . At high actin intensity areas , CCP density scaled up as well . Interestingly , at the top right part of the plane , where actin intensities and CCP densities were both high , CCP inten - sities on average were dimmer . This result is consistent with our ﬁ nding in Fig . 1 where dimmer CCPs had more FPRs . The result also agrees with our recent ﬁ nding that small and short - lived CCPs are capable of signaling [ 12 ] . Together , our analysis provides clear evidence that fMLP stimulation promotes nucleation of CCP and sug - gests the endocytic machineries signal to actin polymerization in neutrophil polari - zation . The observation of smaller CCPs is consistent with previous ﬁ ndings that cells with high tension have smaller CCPs [ 34 , 35 ] where we expect the leading edge of the cell to have higher membrane tension [ 36 ] . Previous work has demon - strated that receptor clustering can promote CCP nucleation [ 13 ] . Ligand binding and receptor clustering is a cellular mechanism to control receptor signaling [ 37 ] , so it is plausible that the dim CCPs represent de novo nucleated CCPs upon FPR clustering . 2 . 6 . There is a dramatic increase in the number and intensity of b - arrestin in polarized neutrophils We speculate the endocytic machineries have to signal to actin assembly during neutrophil polarization so there should be a spatial relationship between signaling sca ﬀ old proteins and actin structures . Our signaling experiments showed CME played an important role in ERK phosphorylation and it has been shown that pERK reinforces actin polymerization at the leading edge during motility [ 38 ] . G protein - independent ERK activation has been shown to be dependent on b - arrestin [ 39 ] . Recent work has also shown that FPR signaling is mediated by b - arrestin [ 2 ] , and we observed colocalization of FPR and b - arrestin when neutrophils are stimu - lated with fMLP ( Sup Fig . 7 ) . Based on these reasons , we investigated the spatial relationship between b - arrestin , acting as a sca ﬀ old intermediates for GPCR signaling , and actin structures . We observed a more distinct di ﬀ erence in b - arrestin immuno ﬂ uorescence between fMLP stimulation and no stimulation compared to clathrin . Without fMLP , b - arrestin only formed dim punctate structures , but in the presence of fMLP , punc - tate structures were much more discernible and distributed all over the cell mem - brane ( Fig . 6A ) . The b - arrestin structures were not only brighter , but the distribution also appeared denser . Following the same analysis as described earlier , 13 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . heliyon . 2018 . e00819 2405 - 8440 / (cid:1) 2018 The Authors . Published by Elsevier Ltd .

Article No w e00819 the b - arrestin intensity histogram and density distribution were in agreement with this observation ( Fig . 6B and C ) . To better quantify the spatial organization of b - arrestin , we mapped each detected b - arrestin to local actin intensity and b - arrestin density space , with the marker size rep - resenting the b - arrestin intensity ( Fig . 6D and E ) . The plot revealed a di ﬀ erent Fig . 6 . fMLP greatly increases the number of b - arrestin on the membrane .

Article No w e00819 pattern for b - arrestin than clathrin . Like clathrin distribution , we ﬁ nd high b - arrestin density at high actin intensity , although there is a range of b - arrestin density . How - ever , at regions with high actin intensity with fMLP stimulation ( i . e . top right corner of the plot ) , we found more and brighter b - arrestin structures ( recall clathrin was dimmer in this region ) . The di ﬀ erence between clathrin and b - arrestin distribution may re ﬂ ect the functional and temporal disparities of the two molecules . Clathrin re - cycles between polymerization and uncoating during the formation of CCVs whereas b - arrestin needs to sustain signaling to actin polymerization during polari - zation and motility . 3 . Conclusion By applying quantitative approaches , our studies have revealed a tight connection between endocytosis of FPR receptor , signaling of fMLP - FPR , and functional polar - ization of neutrophils ( Fig . 7 ) . Assembly of CCPs and internalization of CCVs are critical for cell signaling and we believe that the ability to spatially organize a variety of molecules into its functional unit is one reason that CME is important in many physiological processes [ 40 ] . As discrete macromolecular assemblies , CCPs can spatially organize cell signaling with spatiotemporal precision . A theoretical study has predicted that polarity requires optimal endocytosis and can be dynamically sta - bilized through positive feedback with directed transport [ 41 ] . In this regard , cell po - larization has been described as a bistable process with competition for actin between myosin II - dependent contractility and dendritic actin polymerization [ 42 ] that allows for retrograde transport of myosin II . Our work shows the critical role CME plays in signaling to actin polymerization , without which polarization would be blocked . As receptor clustering and CCP initiation can be tuned depending on Fig . 7 . Model summarizing the role of CME of fMLP receptor in mediating neutrophil polarization . Spatially localized internalization of fMLP receptor is important for signaling to the actin cytoskeleton during neutrophil polarization . 15 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . heliyon . 2018 . e00819 2405 - 8440 / (cid:1) 2018 The Authors .

Materials and method 4 . 1 . Cell culture and di ﬀ erentiation We received HL - 60 cell as a gift from Dr . Orion Weiner ( UCSF ) . HL - 60 cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 % heat - inactivated FBS and 1 % penicillin streptomycin at 37 (cid:4) C / 5 % CO 2 . Neutrophil - like cells used in experiments were di ﬀ erentiated from HL - 60 by introducing 1 . 5 % DMSO into growth medium for 3 e 6 days . 4 . 2 . Flow cytometric analysis of fMLP or transferrin internalization The ﬂ ow cytometry assay was performed to measure the internalization of fMLP . Di ﬀ erentiated cells were ﬁ rst serum - starved for 30 min at 37 (cid:4) C and then incubated with 100 nM ﬂ uorescein conjugate of formyl - Nle - Leu - Phe - Nle - Tyr - Lys ( abbrevi - ated as FITC - fMLP ) ( F1314 , Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , MA ) or 25 m g / ml of Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated transferrin ( T23366 , Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , MA ) on ice for 30 min to equilibrate the binding between ligands and receptors . The cells were transferred to 37 (cid:4) C water bath and incubated for the indicated amount of time , while keeping one sample on ice as a control . The endocytosis was halted by adding a vol - ume of ice - cold mHBSS and returning the sample to ice . Samples were then spun at 400 (cid:5) g to pellet and washed with acid bu ﬀ er ( 500 mM Glycine in mHBSS , pH ¼ 2 . 7 ) to remove surface bound ligand molecules , followed by two more ice - cold mHBSS washes . The samples were measured within an hour using Guava easyCyte ﬂ ow cytometer ( Millipore , MA ) . 4 . 3 . Fibronectin coverslip coating In order for cells to adhere to the surface , all coverslips were coated with 100 m g / mL ﬁ bronectin ( F4759 , Sigma , MO ) in Ca 2 þ / Mg 2 þ - free PBS for 1 hr . The coated cov - erslips were then washed twice with Ca 2 þ / Mg 2 þ - free PBS and incubated in mHBSS with 1 % endotoxin - free human serum albumin ( Gemini Bio - Products , CA ) for more than 15 min . They were used within the day of preparation . 4 . 4 . Immunostaining For immunostaining , cells were ﬁ xed in ice - cold 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde in intracel - lular bu ﬀ er ( 140 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM EGTA , 320 mM sucrose , and 20 16 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . heliyon . 2018 . e00819 2405 - 8440 / (cid:1) 2018 The Authors .

Article No w e00819 mM HEPES with pH 7 . 5 ) for 45 min on ice . For imaging fMLP internalization , cells were washed with acid bu ﬀ er ( 500 mM Glycine in mHBSS , pH ¼ 2 . 7 ) prior to ﬁ x - ation . After washing and permeabilization with 1 % Triton X - 100 , cells were then blocked in intracellular bu ﬀ er containing 1 % bovine serum albumin for 1 hr , before incubating with primary antibody overnight at 4 (cid:4) C . On the second day , after washed six times with PBS , samples were incubated with secondary antibody along with rhodamine - phalloidin ( PHDR1 , Cytoskeleton , CO ) and DAPI ( D9542 , Sigma - Aldrich , MO ) for 3 hours at room temperature at manufacturer ’ s recommended con - centrations . Cells were imaged after washing with PBS . In immunostaining experiments , we have used the following antibodies : AF647 mouse e a - human fMLP receptor ( 565623 , BD Biosciences , CA ) , phospho - myosin light chain2 ( Ser19 ) antibody ( # 3675 , Cell Signaling Technology , MA ) , a - tubulin antibody ( # 2144 , Cell Signaling Technology , MA ) , clathrin antibody [ X22 ] ( ab2731 , Abcam , MA ) , b - arrestin - 1 / 2 antibody ( sc - 74591 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , TX ) . 4 . 5 . Spatial correlation between CCP and FPR CCPs and FPRs were imaged using TIR - FM . CME Analysis software was used to detect the location and intensity of each CCP and FPR . Next , to quantify the spatial correlation between two structures , we calculated the following quantities for each CCP . Without loss of generality , consider CCP i with center location ð x c ; y c Þ : 1 .

Each individual CCP is mapped to a plane where x - axis is the CCP intensity and y - axis the number of FPR puncta surrounding it ( the ﬁ rst quantity above ) with the marker size indicating the average FPR intensity ( the second quantity ) . 17 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . heliyon . 2018 . e00819 2405 - 8440 / (cid:1) 2018 The Authors .

Microscopy for ﬁ xed samples We employed di ﬀ erent imaging systems for di ﬀ erent experiments . To observe cla - thrin and b - arrestin , we used total internal re ﬂ ection ﬂ uorescence microscopy ; for each cell , we also recorded the actin and nucleus using epi - ﬂ uorescence microscopy which is available on the same microscope . TIR - FM was performed on a Nikon TiE - Perfect Focus System ( PFS ) microscope equipped with an apochromat 100X objec - tive ( NA 1 . 49 ) , a sCMOS camera ( Flash 4 . 0 , Hamamatsu Photonics , Japan ) , and a laser launch controlled by an acoustooptic tunable ﬁ lter ( AOTF ) . To measure the e ﬀ ect of drug treatments on neutrophil polarization , cells were stained with a - tubulin , phospho - myosin light chain 2 , actin and nucleus and imaged using Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi - Mode Reader ( BioTek , VT ) equipped with 20X objective and DAPI , GFP , RFP , and Cy7 imaging ﬁ lter cubes . 4 . 7 . Kolmogorov - Smirnov ( KS ) test KS test was used to test if the two one - dimensional probability distributions di ﬀ er . The null - hypothesis between two distributions is rejected at a at : D n ; m > c ð a Þ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ m þ n mn r where n and m are the sizes of the ﬁ rst and second distribution , c is a threshold that depends on the level of signi ﬁ cance a , D n ; m is the absolute value of the KS test . In our studies , m ; n z 1000 , if we want to reject the null - hypothesis at level a ¼ 0 : 05 , which means c ð a Þ ¼ 1 : 36 , then we will have D 1000 ; 1000 > 1 : 36 (cid:5) ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 1 500 q ¼ 0 : 061 . 4 . 8 . Spatial correlation between CCP / b - arrestin and actin CCP and b - arrestin structures were imaged using TIR - FM to obtain high - resolution and high signal - noise ratio pictures . CME analysis package was used to faithfully detect the dot - like structures ( for CCPs and b - arrestin ) [ 11 ] . For each dot - like struc - ture , its location ð x i ; y i Þ and intensity A i in the cell was determined . To obtain the correlation between CCP / b - arrestin and actin intensity , we calculated the local den - sity for each detected CCP / b - arrestin as well as the corresponding intensity at the same location for actin . The density can be formulated mathematically : local density j ð x j ; y j Þ ¼ P ð x i ; y i Þ ˛ detected pucta L (cid:7) R 2 d (cid:3) (cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:5) x i (cid:3) x j (cid:5)(cid:5) 2 þ (cid:5)(cid:5) y i (cid:3) y j (cid:5)(cid:5) 2 (cid:8)(cid:8) p R 2 d where L ð x Þ ¼ (cid:4) 1 ; x (cid:6) 0 0 ; x < 0 , R d is the radius we used to calculated the local density for dot - like structures , and ð x i ; y i Þ is the coordinates we obtained from the detection results . Similarly , local actin intensity can be formulated : 18 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . heliyon . 2018 . e00819 2405 - 8440 / (cid:1) 2018 The Authors . Published by Elsevier Ltd .

We selected di ﬀ erent values for R d and r : we wanted to count a reasonable number of CCP / b - arrestin structures but they were somewhat sparse , but for actin intensity we could choose a relatively small radius so that we could average the potential noise yet still have a good approximation at a speci ﬁ c location . 4 . 9 . Polarization quanti ﬁ cation In order to unbiasedly quantify drug e ﬀ ect on neutrophil polarization , we used Cyta - tion 5 imager to take around 1000 cells per condition . A customized CellPro ﬁ ler pipe - line , which implemented watershed algorithm , was applied to the images to e ﬀ ectively generate the masks for individual cells . To overcome over - segmentation of the water - shed algorithm , we used DAPI as the marker image , added up three other channel im - ages ( MT , actin and pMyosinII ) as the secondary image , and then applied the watershed algorithm . We then manually inspected every cell / mask pair and discarded the cells which were mistakenly segmented . Using the generated masks , we calculated the following morphological features : area , perimeter , circularity , solidity , eccentric - ity , major axis length , minor axis length and equivalent diameter . Employing both the staining image and mask , we quanti ﬁ ed the intensity features and center features , which are listed in Sup Table 1 . The feature extraction was implemented in MatLab . 4 . 10 . Western blot analysis For Western blots , an equal volume of ice - cold 20 % trichloroacetic acid ( TCA ) was added to the sample to lyse the cells . 40 mM NaF and 20 mM b - glycerophosphate were included if blotting against the phospho - proteins . The mixtures were then kept at 4 (cid:4) C overnight for maximum yield of proteins . Lysates were then centrifuged at 13 , 000 (cid:5) g at 4 (cid:4) C for 5 min to pellet . The pellets were then washed in 0 . 5 % TCA once and then resuspended in 50 m L 2 (cid:5) Laemmli sample bu ﬀ er ( 1610737 , Bio - Rad , CA ) containing 30 mM NaOH and 5 % b - mercaptoethanol . Protein bands were separated by SDS - PAGE gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane . The membrane was blocked with 5 % milk and incubated overnight with following antibodies : CHC [ TD . 1 ] ( 24578 , Abcam , MA ) ; pAkt308 ( 2965 or 4056 , Cell Signaling Technology , MA ) ; pAkt473 ( 4060 , Cell Signaling Technology , MA ) ; total Akt ( 4691 , Cell Signaling Technology , MA ) ; pERK ( 9106 or 4376 , Cell Signaling Technology , MA ) ; GAPDH ( 24778 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , TX ) ; actin ( 8432 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , TX ) .

Drug treatment For Pitstop2 and Dynasore experiments , cells were ﬁ rst serum - starved for 30 min and then pre - incubated with 25 m M Pitstop2 ( ab120687 , Abcam , MA ) or 75 m M Dy - nasore ( ab120192 , Abcam , MA ) for 15 min ; then experimental groups were stimu - lated with 100 nM fMLP for 5 min at 37 (cid:4) C , during which control groups were kept in 37 (cid:4) C , before halting the stimulation by adding a volume of ice - cold 2x ﬁ xation bu ﬀ er ( 7 . 4 % paraformaldehyde in 2x intracellular bu ﬀ er ) .
