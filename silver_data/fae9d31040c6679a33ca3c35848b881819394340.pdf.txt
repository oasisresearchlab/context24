Although a role for calponin in muscle cells has been described , the biochemical activities and in vivo functions of nonmuscle calponins and transgelins are largely unknown . Herein , we have used genetic and biochemical analyses to characterize the budding yeast member of this family , Scp1 , which most closely resembles transgelin and contains one calponin homology ( CH ) domain . We show that Scp1 is a novel component of yeast cortical actin patches and shares in vivo functions and biochemical activities with Sac6 / ﬁmbrin , the one other actin patch component that contains CH domains . Puriﬁed Scp1 binds directly to ﬁlamentous actin , cross - links actin ﬁlaments , and stabilizes ﬁlaments against disassembly . Sequences in Scp1 sufﬁcient for actin binding and cross - linking reside in its carboxy terminus , outside the CH domain . Overexpression of SCP1 suppresses sac6 (cid:1) defects , and deletion of SCP1 enhances sac6 (cid:1) defects . Together , these data show that Scp1 and Sac6 / ﬁmbrin cooperate to stabilize and organize the yeast actin cytoskeleton . INTRODUCTION Actin ﬁlament assembly and organization are regulated by a large number of actin - associated proteins that use a limited set of structural modules to achieve great diversity of activ - ities ( Matsudaira , 1991 ) . One such protein module , the cal - ponin homology ( CH ) domain , is found in actin - associated proteins that cross - link actin ﬁlaments ( e . g . , spectrin , ﬁl - amin , and ﬁmbrin ) , link actin to other cytoskeletal systems ( e . g . , ﬁmbrin and plectin ) , and form signaling scaffolds ( e . g . , IQGAP , Vav ; reviewed in Gimona et al . , 2002 ) . It is well established that a pair of CH domains forms a classic actin binding domain ( e . g . , (cid:1) - actinin and ﬁmbrin ; reviewed in Matsudaira , 1991 ) . In contrast , calponin family members contain only a single CH domain , and it remains controver - sial whether this domain can bind to actin ﬁlaments ( Gi - mona and Winder , 1998 ; Fu et al . , 2000 ; Winder , 2003 ) . The calponin protein family , which includes calponins and transgelins , is characterized by a single CH domain located at the amino terminus and either one or more c al - ponin - l ike r epeats ( CLR ) located at the carboxy terminus ( Prinjha et al . , 1994 ) . Both mammalian transgelin and Saccha - romyces cerevisiae calponin ( Scp1 ) have a single CLR , whereas mammalian calponin contains three CLRs ( Figure 1 ) . The calponin family is highly conserved from yeast to humans . Fungal genomes ( S . cerevisiae , Schizosaccharomyces pombe , and Neurospora crassa ) contain a single transgelin - like gene , whereas higher eukaryotic genomes have multiple transge - lins and calponins . This evolutionary conservation of calpo - nin family proteins suggests that they may have highly conserved functions in vivo , yet our understanding of these functions is limited . Calponin is a regulator of smooth mus - cle contraction , but the functions of nonmuscle calponins are not as well understood ( reviewed in Morgan and Gango - padhyay , 2001 ) . Transgelin ( also called SM22 and WS3 - 10 ; Lees - Miller et al . , 1987a ; Lawson et al . , 1997 ) was named for its in vitro gelation activity on actin ﬁlaments ( Shapland et al . , 1993 ) , but this activity has been questioned because it does not occur at physiological salt concentrations ( see DISCUS - SION ) . In vivo , transgelin localizes to actin structures such Article published online ahead of print . Mol . Biol . Cell 10 . 1091 / mbc . E03 – 01 – 0028 .

DC1 Supplemental Material can be found at : as stress ﬁbers ( Fu et al . , 2000 ) , yet the ability of transgelin to bind directly to actin ﬁlaments in vitro also has been dis - puted ( Gimona and Mital , 1998 ; Morgan and Gango - padhyay , 2001 ) . Increased levels of transgelin expression have been correlated with cell differentiation and senes - cence , but the function , if any , of transgelins in these pro - cesses has not been demonstrated ( Thweatt et al . , 1992 ; Liu et al . , 1994 ; Grigoriev et al . , 1996 ) . Thus , little is known about the in vitro or in vivo functions of transgelins . The S . cerevisiae genome contains a single open reading frame with homology to the calponin protein family , and this gene was annotated as S . cerevisiae calponin homolog , Scp1 ( Epp and Chant , 1997 ) . However , the domain organi - zation of Scp1 more closely resembles transgelin than calpo - nin . As shown in Figure 1B , Scp1 contains a single CH domain ( residues 28 – 139 ; shaded ) and one calponin - like repeat ( residues 174 – 200 ; underlined ) . The yeast genome encodes two other proteins with readily apparent CH do - mains , Sac6 ( ﬁmbrin ) and Iqg1 / Cyk1 ( IQGAP ) , shown sche - matically in Figure 1A . IQGAP has a single CH domain , localizes to the bud neck , and functions in cytokinesis , but little is known about its interactions with actin ( Epp and Chant , 1997 ; Lippincott and Li , 1998 ) . Sac6 / ﬁmbrin binds to and bundles actin ﬁlaments through a tandem pair of actin binding domains , each comprised of two CH domains . Sac6 localizes to cortical actin patches and actin cables and is important for actin organization , endocytosis , and cell po - larity in vivo ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ; Adams et al . , 1991 ; Kubler and Riezman , 1993 ) . Herein , we show that the S . cerevisiae transgelin homolog Scp1 is a novel component of the cortical actin cytoskeleton and a bona ﬁde actin ﬁlament binding and cross - linking protein . The sequences in Scp1 critical for actin ﬁlament binding and cross - linking reside outside of the CH domain . Genetic interactions between SCP1 and SAC6 / ﬁmbrin and similar biochemical activities suggest that these two CH domain - containing proteins cooperate in vivo to regulate the stability and organization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton . MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains and Growth Conditions The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 . Standard methods were used for growing and manipulating yeast ( Guthrie and Fink , 1991 ) . To generate AGY189 , the coding regions of SAC6 and SCP1 in AGY20 were replaced with LEU2 and HIS3 , respec - tively . AGY189 was sporulated and resulting haploid strains of opposite mating type were crossed to generate AGY490 , AGY491 , AGY492 , and AGY493 . For growth assays , homozygous diploid strains carrying vectors ( pRS313 , pRS314 , pRS315 , and pRS316 ) and / or plasmids ( Table 2 ) were grown to log phase and then serially diluted ﬁvefold , spotted on plates , and grown for an addi - tional 2 – 3 d . Latrunculin A sensitivity of cells was measured by halo assays as described previously ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) . Plasmid Construction The coding region of the SCP1 gene ( YOR367w ) , plus 397 bases of sequence upstream of the translation start site , was ampliﬁed by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) from wild - type yeast genomic DNA . The PCR product was cloned into the Cla I and Sma I sites of pRS316 ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) , generating pAG20 . For addi - tional SCP1 constructs , we introduced by site - directed mutagenesis ( QuikChange kit ; Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) , a Bgl II site at the start codon of SCP1 in pAG20 , generating pAG3 . To construct an amino terminal green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) - SCP1 fusion plasmid ( pAG9 ) , we cloned GFP as a Bam HI fragment from plasmid B3355 ( Fink laboratory collection ) into the Bgl II site of pAG3 . To generate an Escherichia coli expression amino terminal hexahistidine - SCP1 fusion construct ( pAG22 ) , SCP1 was excised from pAG3 as a Bgl II - Xho I fragment and cloned into the Bam HI and Xho I sites of pTrcHisA ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . To generate SCP1 Gal - over - expression plasmids ( pAG179 ) , the Bgl II - Xho I SCP1 fragment was cloned into the Bam HI and Xho I sites of pRS426Gal1 ( Christianson et al . , 1992 ) . Point mutations in SCP1 ( S185A and S185D ) were gener - ated by site - directed mutagenesis as described above . To generate N136 and 136C constructs , sequences coding for the amino terminus and carboxy terminus of Scp1 were ampliﬁed by PCR and cloned into Nco I and Hind III sites of pProET™HTa ( Invitrogen ) and pBAT4 ( Peranen et al . , 1996 ) . All mutant scp1 constructs were sequenced to verify that no additional mutations had been introduced . Figure 1 . Domain organization of Scp1 and related proteins .

Molecular Biology of the Cell 2618 Protein Puriﬁcation Yeast actin was puriﬁed as described previously ( Goode et al . , 1999 ) . His6 - tagged Scp1 proteins were expressed in BL21 / DE3 E . coli and puriﬁed on nickel resin as per manufacturer’s instructions ( QIA - GEN , Valencia , CA ) . Peak fractions eluted from the nickel column were pooled and fractionated on a monoQ ( 5 / 5 ) column by using an AKTA FPLC ( Amersham Biosciences , Piscataway , NJ ) . Peak frac - tions were pooled , concentrated in a Centricon 10 device ( Millipore , Bedford , MA ) , and exchanged into HEKG5 buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA , 50 mM KCl , 5 % glycerol ) . The proteins were aliquoted , frozen in liquid nitrogen , and stored at (cid:2) 80°C . Untagged carboxyl - terminal fragment of Scp1 was expressed in E . coli . Cells were lysed in HEKG5 buffer by using french press , and the lysate was clariﬁed by centrifugation at 313 , 000 (cid:3) g at 4°C for 30 min ( high - speed supernatant ; HSS ) . HSS was fractionated on a 1 - ml HiTrap SP column ( Amersham Biosciences ) . Peak fractions were pooled , diluted in low salt buffer , and fractionated on a Mono S column . Peak fractions were concentrated and fractionated on a Superdex 75 ( 5 / 30 ) column ( Amersham Biosciences ) equilibrated in HEKG5 buffer . Peak fractions were pooled concentrated , aliquoted , frozen in liquid nitrogen , and stored at (cid:2) 80°C . Untagged full - length Scp1 was puriﬁed from yeast overexpressing SCP1 ( BJ2168 carrying pAG179 ) . One liter of cells was grown to mid - log phase in SC - His medium with 2 % rafﬁnose . Then , 2 % galactose was added to the medium , and cells were grown for an additional 12 h and harvested by centrifugation . The cell pellet was resuspended in 0 . 3 volume of water and frozen in droplets in liquid nitrogen . Next , the frozen yeast cells were lysed in a coffee grinder by using liquid nitrogen , described under “Lab Protocols” on the Goode Laboratory Web site at www . bio . brandeis . edu / goodelab . An HSS was generated in HEKG5 buffer supplemented with 0 . 5 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) and protease inhibitors as described previously ( Goode et al . , 1999 ) . The HSS was fractionated on a 1 - ml HiTrap SP column ( Amersham Biosciences ) , and proteins were eluted with a linear salt gradient ( 50 – 500 mM KCl ) . Scp1 eluted at approximately 200 mM KCl . Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to 3 ml in a Centricon 10 device and then fractionated on a Superdex 75 ( 26 / 60 ) column ( Amersham Biosciences ) equilibrated in HEKG5 buffer . Peak frac - tions were pooled , concentrated as described above , aliquoted , fro - zen in liquid nitrogen , and stored at (cid:2) 80°C . Sac6 was puriﬁed as described above for untagged Scp1 with the following exceptions : AAY1918 strain was used for galactose induction ; after the HSS was fractionated on a HiTrap Q column , the Sac6 - containing fractions were pooled , desalted , and fractionated on a monoQ ( 5 / 5 ) column . Peak fractions were pooled , concentrated in Centricon 10 devices , and fractionated on a Superose12 ( 5 / 30 ) gel ﬁltration column ( Am - ersham Biosciences ) equilibrated in HEKG5 buffer . Sac6 peak frac - tions were pooled , concentrated , aliquoted , frozen in liquid nitro - gen , and stored at (cid:2) 80°C . Tpm1 was puriﬁed as described previously ( Liu and Bretscher , 1989 ) . Actin Filament Binding and Cross - Linking Assays Yeast actin was assembled as follows . Actin ( 50 (cid:2) M ) in G - buffer ( 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP ) was thawed on ice , precleared by centrifugation , and 20 (cid:3) initiation mix ( 10 mM ATP , 40 mM MgCl 2 , 1 M KCl ) was added to induce polymerization . Reactions were incubated fo r 1 h at 25°C . Then , actin ﬁlaments were diluted in F - buffer ( 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 7 mM ATP , 2 mM MgCl 2 , and 50 mM KCl ) , puriﬁed proteins ( Scp1 , Sac6 , and Tpm1 ) , and / or HEKG5 buffer was added , and the reactions were incubated at room temperature for 1 h . For low - speed pelleting assays , reactions were centrifuged for 10 min at 10 , 000 (cid:3) g , 4°C . For high - speed pelleting assays , actin ﬁlaments were pelleted by centrifugation for 30 min at 313 , 000 (cid:3) g in a TLA100 rotor ( Beckman Coulter , Fullerton , CA ) . In both assays , supernatants and pellets were fractionated on SDS - PAGE gels , stained with Coomassie , and bands were quantiﬁed by densitome - try with NIH Image ( version 1 . 61 , available at sippy . nimh . nih . gov ) . The binding constant ( K d ) of Scp1 for actin ﬁlaments was deﬁned as the concentration of Scp1 at which half - maximal Scp1 binding oc - curred . For light scattering assays , yeast actin was thawed on ice , diluted in G - buffer , and mixed with 20 (cid:3) initiation mix plus Scp1 and / or HEKG5 buffer . Light scattering was monitored overtime at 360 nm in a ﬂuorescence spectrophotometer ( Photon Technology International , Lawrenceville , NJ ) held at a constant temperature of 25°C . Apparent viscometry of actin solutions was measured by the falling ball assay , performed as described previously ( Pollard and Cooper , 1982 ) . Rabbit muscle G - actin ( Cytoskeleton , Denver , CO ) was clariﬁed by centrifugation for 30 min at 313 , 000 (cid:3) g 4°C in a TLA100 rotor . Capillary tubes were loaded with actin ( 4 . 2 (cid:2) M ) , Table 1 .

For electron microscopy , 2 (cid:2) l of reactions were spotted onto freshly ionized carbon - coated grids , stained with 1 % uranyl acetate , and visualized using a Phil - lips EM410 transmission electron microscope . Actin Filament Disassembly Kinetics Yeast actin ( with 1 % pyrene labeled rabbit skeletal muscle actin ; Cytoskeleton ) was assembled at 35 (cid:2) M as described above . Actin ﬁlaments ( 7 (cid:2) l ) in F - buffer was mixed with 52 . 5 (cid:2) l of F - buffer and 7 (cid:2) l of Scp1 and / or HEKG5 buffer and incubated for 10 min at room temperature . Actin ﬁlaments were agitated by vortexing for 10 s , and then mixed with 3 . 5 (cid:2) l of latrunculin A ( 400 (cid:2) M ) in a cuvette . The ﬁnal reactions contained 3 . 5 (cid:2) M actin , 20 (cid:2) M latrun - culin A , and variable concentrations of Scp1 ( 0 – 2 (cid:2) M ) . The depolymerization kinetics of pyrene - labeled actin ﬁlaments was monitored by excitation at 365 nm and emission at 407 nm in a ﬂuorescence spectrophotometer held at a constant temperature of 25°C . Fluorescence Light Microscopy Images of cells were acquired using a Nikon TE300 inverted ﬂuorescence microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu Orca charge - coupled device camera controlled by Openlab software ( Improvision , Lexington , MA ) . The localization pattern of GFP - Scp1 fusion protein was examined in live yeast cells grown to log phase . To disrupt the actin cytoskeleton , cultures were treated with 200 (cid:2) M latrunculin A for 5 min before imaging ( Figure 2A ) . Colocalization of GFP - Scp1 and actin ( Figure 2B ) was performed essentially as described previously ( Warren et al . , 2002 ) . Brieﬂy , 1 ml of exponentially growing cells was ﬁxed with 70 % ethanol on ice for 10 min , and cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 (cid:3) g and resuspended in 100 (cid:2) l of phosphate - buffered saline buffer plus 1 mg / ml bovine serum albumin and 10 (cid:2) l of rhodamine - phalloidin ( 300 U in 1 . 5 ml of methanol ; Molecular Probes , Eu - Figure 2 .

After incubation on ice for 5 min , cells were washed three times in phosphate - buffered saline buffer and mounted on a slide for imaging . RESULTS Scp1 Localizes to Cortical Actin Patches In Vivo To investigate the in vivo function of Scp1 , we ﬁrst exam - ined localization of Scp1 in yeast cells . We were unable to localize endogenous Scp1 by using anti - Scp1 antibodies or hemagglutinin ( HA ) - tagged Scp1 by using anti - HA antibod - ies , likely because Scp1 is expressed at low levels ( see be - low ) . Therefore , we examined the localization of GFP - Scp1 expressed under the control of the SCP1 promoter from a low copy plasmid . As shown in Figure 2A , GFP - Scp1 local - ized to motile cortical patches , largely polarized in the bud , but also present in the mother cell . The GFP - Scp1 patches disappeared rapidly after cells were treated brieﬂy with 200 (cid:2) M latrunculin A , an actin monomer - sequestering agent ( Figure 2A ) . Thus , ﬁlamentous actin is required for GFP - Scp1 localization . In ﬁxed cells , GFP - Scp1 patches colocal - ized with rhodamine - phalloidin stained actin patches , dem - onstrating that GFP - Scp1 localizes to actin patches ( Figure 2B ) . Although all GFP - Scp1 patches overlapped with actin patches , (cid:4) 16 % of actin patches ( n (cid:5) 89 ) did not have a corresponding GFP signal . This leaves open the possibility that some actin patches do not contain Scp1 . Deletion of SCP1 Enhances sac6 (cid:1) Phenotypes To further study SCP1 in vivo function , we generated a complete deletion of the SCP1 gene . This mutation alone had no salient phenotype in haploid or diploid cells , but did show speciﬁc genetic interactions with sac6 (cid:1) . Among the many phenotypes tested for the scp1 (cid:1) single mutants were growth at a full range of temperatures , growth under vari - ous stresses ( e . g . , NaCl , caffeine , and benomyl ) , cell mor - phology , bipolar budding pattern , actin cytoskeleton orga - nization , and endocytosis ( assayed by lucifer yellow , FM4 - 64 uptake and Ste6 internalization ) . The only detectable phenotype of scp1 (cid:1) was a modest but reproducible sensitiv - ity to latrunculin A ( Table 3 ) . Given the high degree of functional redundancy among components of cortical actin patches ( reviewed in Pruyne and Bretscher , 2000 ; Goode and Rodal , 2001 ) , we tested for synthetic genetic interactions between SCP1 and other genes that regulate actin function . The scp1 (cid:1) mutants showed synthetic defects only with sac6 (cid:1) , but not with abp1 (cid:1) , aip1 (cid:1) , arp2 - 1 , cap2 (cid:1) , cof1 - 22 , crn1 (cid:1) , end3 (cid:1) , las17 (cid:1) , pan1 - 4 , rvs167 (cid:1) , sla1 (cid:1) , sla2 (cid:1) , srv2 (cid:1) , tpm1 (cid:1) , or tpm2 (cid:1) . Deletion of SCP1 enhanced many pheno - types of sac6 (cid:1) , including temperature and caffeine sensitiv - ity ( Figure 3A ) , salt sensitivity ( our unpublished observa - tion ) , and latrunculin A sensitivity ( Table 3 ) . Deletion of SCP1 did not further enhance the actin organization or en - docytosis phenotypes of sac6 (cid:1) cells , which already have depolarized actin cytoskeleton and fail to accumulate lucifer yellow dye in the vacuole ( our unpublished observations ) . The scp1 (cid:1) sac6 (cid:1) double mutant cells provided a genetic background that permits direct testing of the Scp1 function in vivo . Mutation of a conserved serine residue in the CLR of mammalian calponin ( Ser175 ) and transgelin ( Ser184 ) dis - rupts actin binding in vitro ( Tang et al . , 1996 ; Fu et al . , 2000 ) . To test whether the analogous residue in Scp1 ( S185 ; Figure 1B ) is important for in vivo function , we generated two substitutions ( S185A and S185D ) . scp1 (cid:1) sac6 (cid:1) cells trans - formed with wild - type or mutant SCP1 constructs were analyzed for growth phenotypes . Both wild - type SCP1 and scp1S185D suppressed the growth defects of scp1 (cid:1) sac6 (cid:1) cells , indicating that these constructs restore SCP1 function . In contrast , cells expressing scp1S185A grew only slightly better than control cells carrying an empty vector ( Figure 3A ) . Stable expression of the mutant proteins was veriﬁed by immunoblotting ( our unpublished observations ) . These data indicate that the conserved serine residue ( located in the CLR ) is critical for Scp1 function in vivo . Additional Copies of SCP1 Partially Suppress the sac6 (cid:1) Growth Phenotype SCP1 expressed from a low copy plasmid suppressed the temperature sensitivity of sac6 (cid:1) scp1 (cid:1) double mutant cells ( Figure 3A ) . To investigate the basis of this effect , we quan - tiﬁed the expression levels of actin , Sac6 , and Scp1 in cells , comparing cell extracts to standard curves of puriﬁed pro - teins ( actin , Sac6 , and Scp1 ) by immunoblotting . The level of Scp1 ( (cid:4) 0 . 01 ng / (cid:2) g total cellular protein ) was considerably lower than that of Sac6 ( (cid:4) 0 . 15 ng / (cid:2) g ) and actin ( (cid:4) 1 ng / (cid:2) g ) . From these values , we calculated that the molar ratio of actin , Sac6 , and Scp1 in cells is (cid:4) 65 : 6 : 1 . The expression level of Scp1 in sac6 (cid:1) scp1 (cid:1) cells carrying a low copy SCP1 plas - mid was two - to threefold higher than endogenous Scp1 levels in wild - type cells ( our unpublished observations ) . This suggested that extra copies of SCP1 can suppress sac6 (cid:1) cell growth defects . To test this hypothesis directly , we transformed sac6 (cid:1) cells with low copy plasmids expressing wild - type and mutant Scp1 proteins . As shown in Figure 3B , a wild - type SCP1 plasmid partially suppressed the temper - ature sensitivity of the sac6 (cid:1) mutant . scp1S185D also par - tially suppressed the sac6 (cid:1) phenotype , whereas scp1S185A showed no suppression . Thus , low - level overexpression of SCP1 partially suppresses the temperature - sensitive growth phenotype of the sac6 (cid:1) mutant , and a speciﬁc mutation in SCP1 abolishes this suppression .

Relative sensitivity was deﬁned as the ratio of latrunculin A concentrations required to produce halos of the same diameter for wild - type and mutant strains . Yeast Calponin Functions with Fimbrin In Vivo Vol . 14 , July 2003 2621 Scp1 Binds to and Cross - Links Actin Filaments In Vitro To test whether Scp1 interacts directly with actin ﬁlaments in vitro , we overexpressed Scp1 in yeast by using a galac - tose - inducible promoter , puriﬁed the protein , and measured its ability to bind actin ﬁlaments in a high - speed cosedimen - tation assay . As shown in Figure 4 , A and B , Scp1 bound to yeast actin ﬁlaments in a concentration - dependent manner with micromolar binding afﬁnity ( K d (cid:5) 0 . 7 (cid:2) M ) and a molar saturation stoichiometry of 1 : 2 Scp1 to actin . Hexahistidine ( His6 ) - tagged Scp1 expressed and puriﬁed from E . coli bound to actin ﬁlaments with a similar afﬁnity ( Figure 4C ) . Figure 3 . Genetic interactions between SCP1 and SAC6 .

A . Goodman et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2622 Mammalian calponin family members have been shown to cross - link actin ﬁlaments ( Shapland et al . , 1993 ; Kola - kowski et al . , 1995 ; Tang et al . , 1997 ) . Using several comple - mentary approaches , we found that Scp1 has a similar ac - tivity . First , His6 - Scp1 increased light scattering of yeast actin ﬁlaments in a concentration - dependent manner ( Fig - ure 5A ) , suggesting that Scp1 organized ﬁlaments into larger structures ( e . g . , bundles or networks ) . Second , we analyzed the reactions from the light scattering experiment in a low - speed pelleting assay . In the absence of Scp1 , most actin remained in the supernatant as expected , but with increas - ing amounts of Scp1 , actin shifted to the pellet ( Figure 5B ) . This concentration - dependent increase in actin pelleting cor - related with the observed increase in light scattering ( Figure 5A ) . To ensure that actin cross - linking by His6 - Scp1 was not due to the tag , we tested untagged Scp1 in the low - speed actin - pelleting assay . Figure 5C shows that the effects of 1 (cid:2) M untagged Scp1 are nearly identical to the effects of 1 (cid:2) M His6 - Scp1 . These results demonstrate that Scp1 cross - links actin ﬁlaments in vitro . To characterize the actin cross - linking activity of Scp1 further , we used the falling ball assay ( Pollard and Cooper , 1982 ) to measure the apparent viscosity of the actin ﬁlament solution in the presence and in the absence of His6 - Scp1 . The apparent viscosity of a 4 (cid:2) M actin ﬁlament solution in - creased markedly when Scp1 concentration exceeded 1 (cid:2) M ( Figure 5D ) . We also examined by electron microscopy neg - atively stained actin ﬁlaments in the presence and in the absence of His6 - Scp1 . In the absence of Scp1 , actin ﬁlaments were distributed evenly throughout the grid ( Figure 6A ) . When actin was polymerized in the presence of Scp1 , actin ﬁlaments formed loose bundles tangled into networks ( Fig - ure 6 , B and C ) . Scp1 cross - linked bundles seemed wavy , and the spacing between ﬁlaments in a bundle was not uniform . In contrast , Sac6 / ﬁmbrin bundles were straight with uniform spacing between ﬁlaments ( Figure 6D ) . The Carboxy Terminus of Scp1 Alone Can Cross - Link Actin Filaments To better understand the molecular mechanism of actin binding and cross - linking by Scp1 , we expressed and puri - ﬁed amino - terminal N ( 1 – 136 ) and carboxyl - terminal C ( 136 – 200 ) fragments of Scp1 ( Figure 1C ) . Although we attempted to generate both His6 - tagged and untagged constructs in E . coli , we were able to isolate only the His6 - tagged N ( 1 – 136 ) and untagged C ( 136 – 200 ) . We tested the puriﬁed proteins for actin binding in the high - speed pelleting assays . In con - trast to the full - length Scp1 , the N ( 1 – 136 ) fragment did not copellet with actin ﬁlaments ( Figure 7A ) . The C ( 136 – 200 ) fragment , on the other hand , copelleted with actin ﬁlaments , indicating that at least one actin - binding site resides in the carboxy terminus of Scp1 . We also tested the ability of the truncated proteins to cross - link actin ﬁlaments . In a low - speed pelleting assay , actin remained in the supernatant in the absence of Scp1 and in the presence of N ( 1 – 136 ) ( Figure 7B ) . However , actin was found mostly in the pellet in the presence of the carboxyl - terminal fragment or the full - length Scp1 . Therefore , untagged carboxy terminus of Scp1 is suf - ﬁcient to cross - link actin ﬁlaments . In addition , we addressed whether a speciﬁc residue in the carboxy terminus ( S185 ) critical for in vivo function of Scp1 ( see above ) , was also important for actin ﬁlament bind - ing . We puriﬁed the His6 - tagged S185A and S185D mutant Scp1 proteins and compared their ability to bind and cross - link actin ﬁlaments with the wild - type Scp1 . Scp1 S185D bound to actin ﬁlaments in a high - speed actin pelleting assay ( Figure 7C ) , cross - linked actin ﬁlaments in the low - speed actin pelleting assay ( our unpublished observations ) , and increased light scattering of the actin ﬁlaments similar to wild - type Scp1 ( Figure 7D ) . In contrast , Scp1 S185A had greatly diminished actin binding and cross - linking activities ( Figure 7 , C and D ; our unpublished observations ) . These results suggest that Scp1 S185D retains much of the wild - Figure 4 . Binding of Scp1 to actin ﬁlaments .

Yeast Calponin Functions with Fimbrin In Vivo Vol . 14 , July 2003 2623 type Scp1 interaction with actin . However , Scp1 S185D showed reduced actin binding afﬁnity compared with wild - type Scp1 at higher salt concentrations ( 150 mM KCl ; our unpublished observations ) . Therefore , the Scp1 S185D inter - action with actin may be weakened , but not nearly to the extent of Scp1 S185A . Scp1 , Like Fimbrin , Decreases the Rate of Actin Filament Disassembly Both Sac6 / ﬁmbrin ( Bretscher , 1981 ; Adams et al . , 1991 ) and Scp1 ( Figures 4 and 5 ) bind to and cross - link actin ﬁlaments ; in addition , Sac6 stabilizes actin ﬁlaments against disassem - bly ( see Figure 5 in Goode et al . , 1999 ) . To address whether Scp1 similarly can stabilize actin ﬁlaments , we compared pyrene - actin ﬁlament disassembly kinetics in the presence and absence of His6 - Scp1 . In the absence of Scp1 , actin ﬁlaments disassembled rapidly , and pyrene ﬂuorescence reached steady state by 600 s ( Figure 8A ) . His6 - Scp1 reduced the rate of actin ﬁlament disassembly in a concentration - dependent manner . Similar effects were observed using un - tagged Scp1 ( our unpublished observations ) . Thus , Scp1 , like Sac6 / ﬁmbrin , stabilizes actin ﬁlaments . Scp1 and Sac6 Compete for Actin Filament Binding In Vitro Given that Scp1 and Sac6 / ﬁmbrin show genetic interactions and have similar biochemical activities on actin , we investi - gated whether they also have overlapping binding sites on actin ﬁlaments . We tested the ability of Scp1 to compete with Sac6 for binding to actin ﬁlaments in a high - speed cosedi - mentation assay , by using constant concentrations of Sac6 ( 0 . 5 (cid:2) M ) and actin ﬁlaments ( 2 (cid:2) M ) and variable concentra - tions of His6 - Scp1 ( 0 – 7 (cid:2) M ) . In the absence of Scp1 , nearly 90 % of the Sac6 bound to actin ﬁlaments ( Figure 8 , B and C ) . The percentage of Sac6 bound to actin ﬁlaments decreased proportionally with increasing concentrations of Scp1 . To test the speciﬁcity of the competition , we assayed Sac6 bind - ing to actin in the presence of another actin binding protein , tropomyosin ( Tpm1 ) . A range of Tpm1 concentrations ( 1 – 10 (cid:2) M ) had no effect on Sac6 binding to actin ﬁlaments ( our unpublished observations ) . Thus , Scp1 speciﬁcally competes with Sac6 for binding to actin . DISCUSSION Calponins and transgelins comprise one of the most widely conserved actin - associated protein families , yet their in vivo Figure 5 . Actin ﬁlament cross - linking by Scp1 . ( A ) Actin ﬁlament assembly and organization monitored by light scattering . Mono - meric yeast actin ( 4 (cid:2) M ) was polymerized in the absence or pres - ence of His6 - Scp1 ( 1 or 2 (cid:2) M ) and monitored for change in light scattering ( 360 nm ) overtime . ( B ) Low - speed pelleting assay for actin ﬁlament cross - linking . The reactions shown in A were centri - fuged at low speed ( 10 , 000 (cid:3) g ) to precipitate cross - linked actin ﬁlament structures . Pellets and supernatants were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie staining . ( C ) Low - speed pelleting assay of 2 . 5 (cid:2) M actin ﬁlaments incubated with and without untagged Scp1 ( middle two lanes ) or His6 - Scp1 ( last two lanes ) . Note that a pro - teolytic fragment of actin is marked by a single asterisk . ( D ) Effect of His6 - Scp1 on viscosity of actin ﬁlaments in solution . Actin ( 4 (cid:2) M ) was polymerized in capillary tubes in the presence of varying concentrations of His6 - Scp1 ( 0 , 0 . 23 , 0 . 46 , 0 . 93 , 1 . 4 , 1 . 8 , and 3 . 7 (cid:2) M ) . Viscosity was measured after 1 - h incubation . Viscosity is inversely proportional to the velocity of the ball moving through the sample ( Pollard and Cooper , 1982 ) . Gelation ( as indicated by the ball - bearing remaining stationary beneath the meniscus ) was observed at Scp1 concentrations above 1 . 4 (cid:2) M . A . Goodman et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2624 function in nonmuscle cells has remained elusive . Further - more , controversy has surrounded the issue of whether transgelins even bind to actin ﬁlaments and / or localize to actin structures in vivo ( reviewed in Small and Gimona , 1998 ; Morgan and Gangopadhyay , 2001 ) . Herein , we have shown unambiguously that the yeast transgelin homolog Scp1 binds directly to actin ﬁlaments , cross - links and stabi - lizes actin ﬁlaments in vitro , and localizes to actin ﬁlament structures in vivo . Furthermore , we established that the sites on Scp1 necessary and sufﬁcient for actin cross - linking re - side in the carboxy terminus , outside the CH domain . We also provide the ﬁrst in vivo evidence for transgelin cellular function , showing that Scp1 cooperates with Sac6 ( ﬁmbrin ) to organize and stabilize the actin cytoskeleton . Finally , our mutant analysis revealed a correlation between in vivo phe - notypes and in vitro activities on actin , demonstrating that actin binding is required for Scp1 in vivo functions . Activities of Scp1 on Actin Filaments In Vitro Scp1 binds directly to actin ﬁlaments with an afﬁnity ( K d of (cid:4) 0 . 7 (cid:2) M ) similar to that reported for other members of the calponin family : 1 (cid:2) M for calponin ( Lu et al . , 1995 ; Tang et al . , 1996 ) and 1 . 3 and 1 . 4 (cid:2) M for transgelin ( Shapland et al . , 1993 ; Kobayashi et al . , 1994 ) . Scp1 also cross - links actin ﬁla - ments . Previous studies have reported actin ﬁlament bun - dling for calponin ( Kolakowski et al . , 1995 ) and actin ﬁla - ment gelation for transgelin ( Shapland et al . , 1993 ) . However , the ability of transgelin to cross - link actin ﬁla - ments has been questioned ( Morgan and Gangopadhyay , 2001 ) , in part because the gelation activity occurs speciﬁcally in low ionic strength buffer and is blocked by the addition of 10 mM KCl ( Shapland et al . , 1993 ) . Using four independent assays , we showed that His6 - Scp1 and untagged Scp1 each cross - link actin ﬁlaments in buffer containing 50 mM KCl . One possible explanation for the discrepancy between pre - vious results and ours is that previous experiments tested transgelin and actin from different species , whereas our experiments used transgelin ( Scp1 ) and actin from the same organism . This raises the possibility that other transgelins besides Scp1 also cross - link actin ﬁlaments . By what mechanism does Scp1 cross - link actin ﬁlaments ? Cross - linking requires either the presence of two actin bind - ing sites within a single polypeptide chain or dimerization of an actin binding protein . All of the data available for calpo - nin family members suggest that they do not dimerize , because they behave as monomers in sedimentation veloc - Figure 6 . Electron micrographs of negatively stained actin ﬁla - ments cross - linked by Scp1 or Sac6 . Actin ﬁlaments ( 15 (cid:2) M ) were polymerized in the presence of control buffer ( A ) , 7 . 5 (cid:2) M His6 - Scp1 ( B and C ) , or 7 . 5 (cid:2) M Sac6 ( D ) , negatively stained with ura - nyl acetate , and photographed at 21 , 000 (cid:3) magniﬁcation . Bar , 100 nm . Yeast Calponin Functions with Fimbrin In Vivo Vol . 14 , July 2003 2625 ity , sedimentation equilibrium , and gel ﬁltration experi - ments ( Lees - Miller et al . , 1987b ; Stafford et al . , 1995 ) . Simi - larly , we found no evidence for Scp1 dimerization by using several methods : gel ﬁltration , yeast two - hybrid assay , and coimmunoprecipitation of HA - tagged Scp1 with untagged Scp1 ( our unpublished observations ) . We cannot rule out the possibility that Scp1 dimerizes ( e . g . , it may dimerize specif - ically when bound to actin ) . However , based on the avail - able data , we speculate that Scp1 ( and possibly other cal - ponins ) cross - link actin ﬁlaments via two distinct actin binding sites . The location of the two sites required for actin ﬁlament cross - linking was revealed by the analysis of the mutant proteins . One actin binding site probably resides in the CLR ( Figure 1B ) , because speciﬁc mutation of a single residue in the CLR ( S185A ) abolished actin ﬁlament cross - linking and greatly reduced actin binding afﬁnity of Scp1 . These results are in agreement with the previous studies that identiﬁed the analogous serine residue to be critical for actin binding of other calponin family members ( Winder et al . , 1993 ; Tang et al . , 1996 ; Fu et al . , 2000 ) . These data also suggest that the mechanism of actin binding by calponins is highly con - served . Our analysis of the truncated Scp1 constructs revealed the location of a second site required for actin ﬁlament cross - linking . The amino - terminal Scp1 fragment His6 - N ( 1 – 136 ) containing CH domain did not bind to actin ﬁlaments , whereas the carboxy - terminal fragment C ( 136 – 200 ) not only bound to actin ﬁlaments , but also cross - linked them . It is formally possible that the hexa - histidine tag interfered with the actin binding of the amino - terminal fragment , yet it seems unlikely , given that the full - length his - tagged Scp1 bound to actin ﬁlaments . In addition , single CH domains of mammalian calponin and transgelin are also not sufﬁcient for in vitro binding to actin ﬁlaments ( Gimona and Mital , 1998 ; Fu et al . , 2000 ) . The second actin binding site or dimer - ization site of Scp1 must reside in the sequences between the CH domain and the CLR . This site may be analogous to the actin binding site S1 of calponin ( Mezgueldi et al . , 1995 ; Mino et al . , 1998 ; Figure 1A ) . Although the sequence of S1 is not conserved among calponin isoforms or in transgelins ( Gimona and Mital , 1998 ) , this region is enriched in posi - tively charged amino acids in all calponin family members . Mutations of the positively charged amino acids in this region decrease actin binding afﬁnity of calponin and trans - gelin ( Gong et al . , 1993 ; Fu et al . , 2000 ) . Further mutational analysis of Scp1 will be required for precise identiﬁcation of the residues required for cross - linking of the actin ﬁlaments . Does the CH domain of Scp1 contribute to actin binding ? Our data show clearly that the CH domain is neither sufﬁ - Figure 7 . Effects of Scp1 muta - tions on actin ﬁlament binding and cross - linking . ( A ) High - speed actin ﬁlament cosedimentation assay . Reactions contained 0 or 5 (cid:2) M yeast actin ﬁlaments and 5 (cid:2) M Scp1 : full - length His6 - Scp1 , amino terminus His6 - Scp1N ( 1 – 136 ) , or carboxy terminus Scp1C ( 136 – 200 ) ( designated WT , N , and C , respec - tively ) . Actin ﬁlaments were pel - leted by high - speed centrifugation and equivalent amounts of the pel - let and supernatant were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie staining . ( B ) Low - speed pelleting assay for actin ﬁlament cross - link - ing . Actin ﬁlaments ( 5 (cid:2) M ) were mixed with 5 (cid:2) M Scp1 [ His6 - Scp1 , His6 - Scp1N ( 1 – 136 ) , Scp1C ( 136 – 200 ) ] or control buffer and centri - fuged for 10 min at 10 , 000 (cid:3) g .

( D ) Actin ﬁlament assembly and organization monitored by light scattering . Monomeric yeast actin ( 10 (cid:2) M ) was polymerized in the absence or presence of 5 (cid:2) M wild - type or mutant His6 - Scp1 and monitored for change in light scattering ( 360 nm ) over time . A . Goodman et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2626 cient nor necessary for actin ﬁlament binding by Scp1 , yet Scp1 competes for actin binding with Sac6 / ﬁmbrin , which binds actin via two tandem pairs of CH domains . This apparent discrepancy may be explained by a recently pro - posed model . Based on comparing cryo - electron microscopy reconstructions of calponin and ﬁmbrin decorated actin ﬁl - aments , it was suggested that the CH domain of calponin may serve as a “locator” domain , helping to position the true actin binding motifs in calponin ( reviewed in Winder , 2003 ) . The CH domain of Scp1 may act similarly . Scp1 Functions with Sac6 to Regulate the Actin Cytoskeleton In Vivo Our genetic and biochemical data , as well as subcellular localization , reveal a functional relationship between Scp1 and Sac6 / ﬁmbrin . Both GFP - Scp1 ( this work ) and Sac6 ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ) localize to cortical actin patches . Sac6 was also reported to colocalize faintly with actin cables by immunoﬂuorescence ; however , this was not observed with GFP - Sac6 ( Doyle and Botstein , 1996 ) . Therefore , it is possible that Scp1 localizes in vivo to both actin patches and cables , but that we have only been able to detect patch localization with GFP - Scp1 . Biochemical analyses show that Scp1 and Sac6 have similar activities on actin . Like Sac6 / ﬁmbrin , Scp1 cross - links actin ﬁlaments in vitro . Sac6 cross - links actin ﬁlaments into tight bundles , and Scp1 cross - links actin into loose bundles and networks . Scp1 , like Sac6 / ﬁmbrin , not only organizes actin ﬁlaments but also decreases the rate of actin ﬁlament disassembly ( ﬁlament stabilization ) . The shared role of SAC6 and SCP1 in stabilizing the actin cy - toskeleton is supported further by the latrunculin A sensi - tivities of sac6 (cid:1) and scp1 (cid:1) mutant cells . Together , these in vitro and in vivo observations suggest that Scp1 and Sac6 cooperate in organizing and stabilizing the actin cytoskele - ton . The overlapping genetic functions of SCP1 and SAC6 may be related to their relative abundance in cells and their ability to compete for actin binding . Using quantitative im - munoblotting , we deﬁned the in vivo molar ratios of actin , Sac6 , and Scp1 to be (cid:4) 65 : 6 : 1 ( actin to Sac6 to Scp1 ) . The higher levels of Sac6 compared with Scp1 suggest that Sac6 may provide the more “dominant” activity on actin . This idea is supported by the relative strengths of their respective null phenotypes . Furthermore , this could explain why as little as two - to threefold higher expression of Scp1 partially suppresses defects in sac6 (cid:1) cells . To demonstrate the importance of the Scp1 – actin interac - tion for in vivo functions , we have used a mutant of Scp1 that has a weak afﬁnity for actin ﬁlaments in vitro . scp1S185A failed to suppress loss of SAC6 or loss of SCP1 function in a sac6 (cid:1) background . On the other hand , scp1S185D mutant , which retained actin ﬁlament binding in vitro , suppressed the phenotypes associated with the loss of SCP1 and SAC6 in vivo . These results provide strong evi - dence that Scp1 – actin interactions are required for in vivo functions of Scp1 shared with Sac6 . A functional relationship between calponins and ﬁmbrin may be conserved in other organisms . Both protein families are widely expressed in different vertebrate tissues and have overlapping subcellular locations . In ﬁbroblasts , ﬁmbrin and calponin are both found on stress ﬁbers ( Shapland et al . , 1988 ; Messier et al . , 1993 ; Babb et al . , 1997 ; Jiang et al . , 1997 ; ) , where they might function together to regulate actin cross - linking and stabilization . In addition , ﬁmbrin and calponin may play a role in adhesive actin structures , linking the actin cytoskeleton to the cell membrane . Fimbrin is found at focal adhesions and podosomes ( Messier et al . , 1993 ; Babb et al . , Figure 8 . Activities of Scp1 on actin ﬁlaments similar to Sac6 / ﬁmbrin . ( A ) Effects of His6 - Scp1 on the rate of actin ﬁlament depo - lymerization . Actin ﬁlament disassembly was initiated by the addi - tion of 20 (cid:2) M latrunculin A to 2 (cid:2) M preformed actin ﬁlaments ( 1 % pyrene labeled ) in the presence of 0 , 67 , 200 , 670 , and 2000 nM His6 - Scp1 , and change in pyrene - actin ﬂuorescence was monitored overtime .

The pellets and supernatants were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie staining . ( C ) The concentrations of Sac6 ( Œ ) and Scp1 ( (cid:2) ) bound to actin ﬁlaments were calculated from gel densitometry and plotted versus the total concentration of His6 - Scp1 in the reactions . Yeast Calponin Functions with Fimbrin In Vivo Vol . 14 , July 2003 2627 1997 ) , and calponin is found in dense plaques , a type of adherence junction similar to podosomes and focal adhe - sions ( North et al . , 1994 ) . Finally , it has been proposed that ﬁmbrin may link the actin cytoskeleton to the vimentin intermediate ﬁlament cytoskeleton , and a vimentin - binding site has been mapped to the ﬁrst CH domain of ﬁmbrin ( Correia et al . , 1999 ) . A similar function for calponin has been suggested by in vitro binding studies and overlapping in vivo localization of desmin and calponin ( North et al . , 1994 ; Mabuchi et al . , 1996 ; Wang and Gusev , 1996 ) . Thus , calponin and ﬁmbrin may have shared in vivo functions that are conserved across a wide range of organisms .
