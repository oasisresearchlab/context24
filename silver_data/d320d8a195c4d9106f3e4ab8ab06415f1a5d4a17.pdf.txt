A complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms of endocytosis requires the discovery and characterization of the protein machinery that mediates this aspect of membrane trafficking . A novel genetic screen was used to identify yeast mutants defective in internalization of bulk lipid . The fluorescent lipophilic styryl dye FM4 - 64 was used in conjunction with FACS ® to enrich for yeast mutants that exhibit internalization defects . Detailed characterization of two of these mu - tants , dim1 - 1 and dim2 - 1 , revealed defects in the en - docytic pathway . Like other yeast endocytosis mutants , the temperature - sensitive dim mutants were unable to endocytose FM4 - 64 or radiolabeled a - factor as effi - ciently as wild - type cells . In addition , double mutants with either dirnl - A or dim2 - 1 and the endocytosis mu - tants end4 - 1 or actl - 1 displayed synthetic growth de - fects , indicating that the DIM gene products function in a common or parallel endocytic pathway . Complemen - tation cloning of the DIM genes revealed identity of D1M1 to SHE4 and DIM2 to PAN1 . Panlp shares ho - mology with the mammalian clathrin adaptor - associ - ated protein , epsl5 . Both proteins contain multiple EH ( e _ psl5 homology ) domains , a motif proposed to medi - ate protein - protein interactions . Phalloidin labeling of filamentous actin revealed profound defects in the actin cytoskeleton in both dim mutants . EM analysis re - vealed that the dim mutants accumulate vesicles and tu - bulo - vesicular structures reminiscent of mammalian early endosomes . In addition , the accumulation of novel plasma membrane invaginations where endocy - tosis is likely to occur were visualized in the mutants by electron microscopy using cationized ferritin as a marker for the endocytic pathway . This new screening strategy demonstrates a role for She4p and Panlp in endocytosis , and provides a new general method for the identification of additional endocytosis mutants . T HE plasma membrane of cells acts as an interface between the cell and the extracellular environment , and serves as an important site for communication and transduction of environmental stimuli into appropri - ate cellular responses . The regulation of exocytosis and endocytosis is crucial for maintaining the appropriate com - position , function , and surface area of the plasma mem - brane during the continuous trafficking of lipids and pro - teins to and from this essential cellular domain . In mammalian cells , endocytosis is responsible for both internalization of nutrients such as iron ( Hemmaplardh and Morgan , 1976 ; Karin and Mintz , 1981 ) and cholesterol ( Anderson et al . , 1977 ) , as well as downregulation of acti - vated receptor - ligand complexes . There are believed to be at least three forms of endocytosis : clathrin dependent , clath - rin independent , and phagocytosis ( Lamaze and Schmid , 1995 ) . The best characterized mechanism is clathrin - depen - dent endocytosis , in which receptors are first concentrated Address all correspondence to Scott D .

The clathrin triskelions can self - assemble in vitro , and this property is thought to provide the mechani - cal force that bends the plasma membrane into a budding coated vesicle . After budding is completed , the coat is dis - assembled , and the adaptors and clathrin triskelions are recycled back through the cytoplasm to reassemble at a new coated pit . The uncoated vesicle then fuses with an endosome before the contents are ultimately delivered to the lysosome , and the vesicular membrane is degraded or recycled to other membrane destinations . Clathrin - inde - pendent endocytosis is less well understood , but may be mediated by two classes of vesicles : " noncoated " vesicles and caveolae ( also known as plasmalemmal vesicles ; Pal - ade , 1953 ; Rothberg et al . , 1992 ) . Finally , phagocytosis is a more specialized form of endocytosis that involves the bulk internalization of particles by an actin - dependent en - gulfment process ( West et al . , 1989 ; Hewlett et al . , 1994 ) . In addition to the well - characterized function of clathrin in endocytosis , a general role for actin in the internalization © The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 96 / 12 / 1485 / 16 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 135 , Number 6 , Part 1 , December 1996 1485 - 1500 1485 of caveolae ( Parton et al . , 1994 ) and in apical endocytosis in MDCK cells ( Gottlieb et al . , 1993 ) has also been dem - onstrated . There are many questions that remain , how - ever , in clarifying the details of both clathrin - dependent and - independent modes of internalization . As an approach to elucidate important molecules and events required for endocytosis , genetic screens using the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been used . Consistent with observations in mammalian cells , many of the gene products identified in these screens reveal a re - quirement for proteins of the actin cytoskeleton ; these proteins include actin ( Kubler and Riezman , 1993 ; Munn et al . , 1995 ) , the putative cytoskeletal proteins End3p and End4p ( Raths et al . , 1993 ; Benedetti et al . , 1994 ) , and the fimbrin homologue Sac6p ( Kubler and Riezman , 1993 ) . In addition , important roles for the amphiphysin homologues Rvsl61p / End6p and Rvs167p ( Munn et al . , 1995 ) , calmod - ulin ( Kubler et al . , 1994 ) , and type I myosins ( Geli and Riezman , 1996 ) in the internalization step of the yeast mating pheromone a - factor have been reported . Screens for end mutants generally have assayed for defects in the internalization of mating pheromone - receptor complexes , a process that at least partially depends on the function of clathrin heavy chains ( Tan et al . , 1993 ) . However , yeast cells deleted for the gene encoding clathrin heavy chain are viable , ( Payne and Schekman , 1985 ) , but these strains internalize mating pheromone receptors at a much re - duced rate relative to wild - type cells ( Payne et al . , 1988 ) . This suggests that , as in mammalian cells , clathrin - inde - pendent modes of endocytosis exist in yeast . Flow cytometry was used previously to describe the endo - cytosis kinetics of fluorescently labeled histone in CHO cells ( Murphy et al . , 1982 ) , and more recently , in a screen for en - docytosis mutants in mammalian cells using fluorescently labeled transferrin as a marker for recycling endosomes ( Cain et al . , 1991 ) . These studies demonstrate the use of a FACS® - based approach for a detailed analysis of endocy - tosis in a population of cells , as well as for the isolation of mutants in the endocytic pathway . We report a novel screen for endocytosis mutants in yeast , using the lipo - philic styryl dye N - ( 3 - triethylammoniumpropyl ) - 4 - ( p - dieth - ylaminophenylhexatrienyl ) pyridium dibromide ( FM4 - 64 ) 1 to follow bulk internalization of plasma membrane ( Vida and Emr , 1995 ) . Unlike previous selections , this screen was designed to isolate mutants defective in mem - brane uptake , a common feature of all pathways of en - docytosis . FM4 - 64 is a suitable probe for this screen be - cause it is an endocytic tracer that travels from the plasma membrane to the vacuolar membrane via punctate cyto - plasmic intermediates in a time - , temperature - , and en - ergy - dependent manner ( Vida and Emr , 1995 ) . We report the isolation of many new candidate endocytosis mutants , as well as the detailed characterization of two of these mu - tants , dim1 - 1 and dim2 - 1 . Both characterized dim mutants exhibit reduced internalization of FM4 - 64 and the mating pheromone a - factor ; additionally , actin localization is dis - rupted in both dim mutants .

So far , no function has been described for PAN1 , but the sequence contains motifs that are present in the mammalian clathrin adaptor - associated protein epsl5 , as well as in yeast End3p , another protein that is required for endocytosis ( Raths et al . , 1993 ; Benedetti et al . , 1994 ) . The dim mutants were found to accumulate aberrant membra - nous structures , including vesicles and tubules that might represent exaggerated intermediates in an endocytic path - way . Preliminary studies examining the internalization of cationized ferritin highlight a route of endocytosis via plasma membrane invaginations that is highly exaggerated in the dim mutants . Materials and Methods Strains and Media Bacterial strains were grown on standard media ( Miller , 1972 ) . The geno - types of Escherichia coli strains used were XL1BIue supE44 thi . 1 lac endA1 gyrA96 hsdR17 relA1 F ' proAB lacP ZAM15 ( Bullock et al . , 1987 ) and JM101 A ( lac - pro ) supE thi - 1 F ' traD36 laclq ZAM15 proAB ( Ya - nisch - Perron et al . , 1985 ) . Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains used ( Table I ) were grown in standard YPD , SD minimal , and sporulation media ( Sherman et al . , 1979 ) . Materials N - ( 3 - triethylammoniumpropyl ) - 4 - ( p - diethylaminophenylhexatrienyl ) py - ridinium dibromide ( FM4 - 64 ) and rhodamine phalloidin were purchased from Molecular Probes , Inc . ( Eugene , OR ) . 35SO4 , and Trans35S label were obtained from ICN Radiochemicals ( Irvine , CA ) . Restriction en - zymes , T4 DNA ligase and polymerase , Klenow enzyme , and alkaline phosphatase were acquired from Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals ( Indianapolis , IN ) or New England Biolabs ( Beverly , MA ) . Sequenase se - quencing kits 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indoyl - 13 - D - galactoside and isopropyl - 13 - o - thiogalactoside were from U . S . Biochemical Corp . ( Cleveland , OH ) , and ct - 35SdATP was acquired from Amersham Corp . ( Arlington Heights , IL ) .

All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co . ( St . Louis , MO ) . Mutagenesis , FM4 - 64 Labeling , and FA CS ® Analysis Ethyl methanesulfonate ( EMS ) mutagenesis of wild - type SEY6210 was performed as described ( Rose et al . , 1990 ) , and 22 - 25 % viability was ob - tained using this procedure . The mutagenized cells were diluted in YPD and grown overnight at 22°C . A 1 - h preincubation at 38°C was followed by a 10 - min labeling with 16 ~ M FM4 - 64 ( 1 : 100 dilution of stock ; 1 . 6 ixM FM4 - 64 in DMSO ) and a 1 - h chase . The cells were then subjected to a sterile sort on a FACStar ® fluorescence - activated cell sorter ( Becton Dickinson & Co . , Mountain View , CA ) , and cells of low fluorescent inten - sity were collected and plated on YPD at 26°C . Replica plating to 38°C permitted analysis of the percent of surviving colonies that were tempera - ture sensitive for growth . Individual colonies were labeled with FM4 - 64 and chased at 38°C , allowing identification of dim mutants . After several back - crosses to SEY6210 and SEY6211 , strains BWY1 , BWY2 , BWY10 , BWYll , and BWY16 were generated carrying diml - 1 or dim2 - 1 alleles . FM4 - 64 labeling of dim mutants was performed as described ( Vida and Emr , 1995 ) , except that cells were grown in YNB plus appropriate amino acids and were diluted 1 : 1 with YPD before the temperature shift to 38°C . FM4 - 64 was used at 16 and 32 ~ M for 38°C and 26°C labeling , respec - tively . Images were acquired under identical conditions using a CCD cam - era ( model 4995 ; COHU , San Diego , CA ) , an integrator box ( model 440A ; Colorado Video Inc . , Boulder , CO ) , and an LG - 3 Frame Grabber ( Scion Corp . , Frederick , MD ) . The software used was NIH Image 1 . 55 and Adobe Photoshop 3 . 0 . Cloning of the DIM1 and DIM2 Genes For cloning of the DIM1 gene , a LEU2 - CEN S . cerevisiae genomic library The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 135 , 1996 1486 ( in the E . coil yeast shuttle vector YCp50 , CEN4 ARS1 URA3 ; Rose et al . , 1987 ) was transformed into BWY1 , replica plated to 38°C , and colonies that were temperature resistant were selected for plasmid rescue . Eight colonies representing three different genomic inserts were isolated from BWY1 temperature - resistant cells and retransformed into BWY1 to con - firm plasmid linkage . Restriction mapping and subcloning narrowed the complementing region to a BgllI - BamHI fragment ( pDIM1 , also known as pSHE , 4 , BgllI - BamHI fragment in pRS414 TRP1 CEN ) that was sequenced on both strands using the Sequenase kit , revealing a 2 , 367 - bp open reading frame predicting a 789 - amino acid protein . 321 bp of the 5 ' end of the neighboring PEP12 gene was also included in this fragment . A deletion construct was generated by cloning the Bglll / BamHI fragment into the BamHI site of pBluescript KSII ( - ) ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) and inserting the HIS3 gene into the ClaI and BstBI sites , which removes 92 % of the open reading frame ( pDIM1A2 ) . This construct was linearized with PvulI and BstYI ( which cuts at the site generated by the BgllI - BamHI ligation ) , and was transformed into the wild - type strains SEY6210 , SEY6211 , and SEY6210 . 5 , generating BWY6 , BWY7 , and BWY5 , respec - tively . PCR analysis using oligonucleotides outside the linearization sites confirmed the deletion of the DIM1 gene . An additional deletion replac - ing the Eco47III - NsiI fragment with LEU2 ( pDIM1A1 ) removed 17 % of the open reading frame and also resulted in a null phenotype . The integra - tive mapping construct was generated by cloning the BgllI - BamHI frag - ment into pRS304 ( pDIM1 - MAP ) , which contains the TRP1 gene and no sequences for maintenance of plasmid replication in yeast . This construct was linearized with NsiI , transformed into BWY3 ( generating BWY4 ) , spornlated , and dissected . To clone the DIM2 gene , a LEU2 - CEN S . cerevisiae genomic library was transformed into BWY10 , replica plated to 38°C , and colonies that were temperature resistant were selected for plasmid rescue . Three colo - nies representing two different genomic inserts were isolated from tem - perature - resistant BWY10 colonies and retransformed into BWY10 ceils to confirm plasmid linkage . Restriction mapping and subcloning narrowed the complementing region to an XmnI - DraI fragment ( pDIM2 , also known as pPAN1 , the XmnI - DraI fragment in pRS415 LEU2 CEN ) . Both ends of two EcoRI fragments were sequenced that revealed identity of the DIM2 gene with PAN1 . Using oligonucleotides and subcloning for further sequencing across regions of incongruity between PAN1 and YIR006c ( the same genomic region identified by the yeast genome project ) showed identity with YIR006c . For the PAN1 disruption construct ( pPAN1 - KO ) , the 4 . 4 - kb SalI - BamHI fragment was subcloned into pBluescript cut with SalI and BamHI , followed by insertion of the HIS3 gene into the EcoRV sites of PAN1 and linearization with SalI and BamHI for integration into SEY6210 . 5 , generating BWY14 . Integrative mapping was done using the BgllI fragment subcloned into pRS303 cut with BamHI to generate pPAN1 - MAP , which was linearized using NcoI and transformed into BWY12 to produce BWY13 . a - Factor Internalization and Degradation Radiolabeled a - factor was produced according to the method of Dulic et al . ( 1991 ) and used in internalization and degradation assays performed es - sentially as described , with the following exceptions : unbound a - factor was removed with one wash of binding buffer at 4°C , followed by a prein - cubation at 26°C or 38°C for 20 - 30 min . To initiate internalization , the cells were diluted to 30 OD / ml by the addition of 4 vol of prewarmed 1 . 25x YPD and 5 % glucose . Experiments were performed two to three times with each strain . Strains BWY17 , BWY15 , and BWY9 were used . BWY15 was generated by crossing BWY10 with a wild - type strain harbor - ing a bar1 - 1 allele . Generation of Double Mutants for Genetic Interaction Studies For vma4 - A dim double mutants , KMY1004a was mated with BWY1 and BWY10 , sporulated , and dissected onto YPD - MES , pH 5 . 5 , plates for ger - mination . For other double mutants , spores were germinated on YPD plates at 26°C , except for end4 doubles , which were germinated at room temperature . DBY1691 was mated with BWY6 and DBY1692 with BVCY10 to generate actl - 1 dim double mutants . RH268 - 1C was crossed to BWY6 and BWY10 to produce end4 - 1 dim double mutants . DIM1 dele - tions were introduced into YASl114 , YASl115 , GPY1000a , and GPY418 by integrating pDIM1AI ( LEU2 ) . 10 - 20 tetrads were dissected in each case , and the identification of alleles contained within a germinated spore was confirmed by back - crossing with parental strains and testing resultant diploids for homozygosity . Phalloidin Labeling of Filamentous Actin and Bud Scar Staining Mid - log phase cells SEY6210 . 5 , BWY8 , BWY12 , SEY6210 , BWY6 , BWY10 , YASl114 , and YASl115 were grown at 26°C , a portion shifted to 38°C for 2 . 5 h , and then fixed and stained with Calcofluor White M2R ( Sigma ) or phalloidin as described ( Benedetti et al . , 1994 ) . Purification of Clathrin - coated Vesicles Vesicles were isolated from SEY6210 and BWY6 as described ( Mueller and Branton , 1984 ) . I ml of every fifth fraction was precipitated with 10 % TCA with the addition of insulin as carrier . The proteins were resolved by SDS - PAGE , immunoblotted , and Chclp was detected using the mAb SKL1 ( Lemmon et al . , 1988 ) at a 1 : 2 , 000 dilution . The data represent at least two independent experiments for each strain . The indicated fractions were fixed with 3 % glutaraldehyde , pelleted at 100 , 000 g for 1 h , and pro - cessed for routine morphology EM as described below . EM and Cationized Ferritin Internalization Conventional EM for routine morphology was performed as described ( Rieder et al . , 1996 ) on SEY6210 , BWY6 , and BWY16 grown at 26°C , and on a portion shifted to 38°C for 90 min . The same strains , as well as RH268 - 1C , YASlll4 , and YASlll5 , were used for eationized ferritin internalization . 15 - OD cells were converted to spheroplasts at 26°C in spheroplasting buffer ( 1 . 2 M sorbitol , 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 10 mM CaC12 , 2 mM DTT , 0 . 6 mM PMSF , 0 . 1 - 1 . 0 mg / ml Zymolyase - 100T ) , washed twice ( 1 . 2 M sorbitol , 100 mM MES , pH 6 . 5 , 0 . 5 mM MgCI 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 6 mM PMSF ) , and resuspended in 1 . 11x internalization buffer ( 1 . 11 x YNB , 2 . 22 % glucose , 1 . 33 M sorbitol , 1 . 11 x amino acids ) at 8 . 3 OD / ml . A preincubation at the appropriate temperature for 30 min was followed by the addition of 0 . 2 ml 10 mg / ml cationized ferritin and continued incubation for 30 min . The cells were gently pelleted , resus - pended in fixative ( 2 % glutaraldehyde , 1 . 2 M sorbitol , 5raM MgClz , 5 mM CaCI2 , 97 mM cacodylate , pH 7 . 4 ) , and processed as described above for EM with the exception of poststaining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate . Results FA CS ® Isolation of dim Mutants The lipophilic dye FM4 - 64 has been shown to be a useful probe for endocytosis in yeast ( Vida and Emr , 1995 ) . We exploited these observations in an enrichment protocol to identify endocytic mutants : the endocytosis mutants end3 - 1 and end4 - 1 were found to internalize less fluorescent dye than wild - type cells ( two - to fourfold reduction in fluores - cent signal in the vacuolar membrane , data not shown ) , and therefore endocytosis mutants could be easily sorted by FACS ® . As an initial test of the feasibility of this approach , we tested whether cells that bind but do not endocytose the dye could be stripped of uninternalized , plasma mem - brane - localized FM4 - 64 . Cells were incubated with FM4 - 64 at 0°C to allow insertion of the dye into the plasma mem - brane , followed by washing at 0°C . For comparison , cells were also incubated with FM4 - 64 at 30°C , followed by a wash and a 60 - rain chase period , during which FM4 - 64 is internalized and transported to the vacuole ( Vida and Emr , 1995 ) . The samples were then subjected to analysis by FACS ® . The cells that were labeled and washed at 0°C ( Fig . 1 A ) revealed a low level of fluorescence that was nearly identical to that observed in unincubated cells ( data not shown ) . The cells with internalized FM4 - 64 displayed ~ 10 times greater fluorescence intensity ( Fig . 1 B ) , which Wendland et al .

FACS ® of FM4 - 64 - 1abeled yeast . ( A ) Wild - type SEY6210 was labeled with FM4 - 64 on ice to restrict the dye to the plasma membrane , and was then washed four times with ice - cold medium to extract the dye , followed by FACS ® analysis . ( B ) SEY6210 was labeled and chased at 30°C to allow internalization from the plasma membrane to the vacuole , followed by FACS ® analysis . ( C ) SEY6210 cells were mutagenized with EMS , incu - bated at 38°C for 1 h , labeled with FM4 - 64 for 10 min , and chased for 1 h . A FACS ® sort was performed , and cells falling into the " dim " window were collected for further analysis . was equivalent to the signal observed in cells labeled at 0°C and not washed ( data not shown ) . This demonstrated that plasma membrane - localized FM4 - 64 could be effi - ciently stripped from cells , and that FACS ® analysis can be used to discriminate cells that endocytose FM4 - 64 versus those that do not . To screen for endocytosis mutants , wild - type cells were mutagenized with EMS and were allowed to recover in rich medium at 22°C for 12 h . The level of EMS mutagene - sis used resulted in an ~ 80 % kill rate , and , of the survi - vors , 10 % were temperature sensitive for growth . The mixed population of cells was then incubated at 38°C for 1 h , followed by a 10 - min incubation with FM4 - 64 and a 1 - h chase period at 38°C . Under these conditions , wild - type cells internalize FM4 - 64 to the vacuole ( see below ) . The temperature shift was performed to allow for the isolation of temperature - conditional alleles of genes required for endocytosis and possibly also for growth , and does not ex - clude the isolation of genes that are not essential . The la - beled and chased cells ( 1 × 107 ) were then subjected to FACS ® and selected from a window of low fluorescent in - tensity ( Fig . 1 C , sort window ) . Approximately 0 . 05 % of the total cells ( 4 , 894 ) were selected by this window , of which 602 yielded viable colonies . 25 % of cells selected by FACS ® were temperature sensitive for growth , a greater than twofold enrichment relative to the unsorted popula - tion . 100 colonies were tested individually for the ability to internalize FM4 - 64 after a 1 - h preshift to 38°C . 10 colonies displayed less intense labeling of the vacuole , referred to as the " dim " phenotype . Two of these mutants that also were temperature sensitive for growth were characterized further . In both , the " dim " phenotype and the tempera - ture sensitivity cosegregated through three back - crosses to the parental strain . The two mutants contained mutations in distinct loci : a diploid strain generated by mating the two mutants resulted in wild - type levels of FM4 - 64 inter - nalization , whereas homozygous mutant diploids were " dim " ( data not shown ) . diml and dim2 Cells Exhibit Endocytosis Defects The fluorescent lipophilic styryl dye FM4 - 64 is useful as a marker to observe the function of the endocytic pathway in yeast . Reduced fluorescent intensity in the vacuolar membrane would presumably correspond to a reduction in endocytic flow from the plasma membrane to the vacuole . We therefore analyzed uptake of FM4 - 64 in the dim mu - tants at both 26°C and 38°C in cells that either did or did not harbor single - copy plasmids encoding wild - type copies of the DIM genes ( see below ) . Identical exposure parame - ters were used when acquiring images to allow fluorescent intensity comparisons . When the labeling was performed at 26°C , vacuolar labeling in diml - A and dim2 - 1 cells was slightly less than wild - type levels ( Fig . 2 , 26°C ) . Labeling that was performed after a 30 - min preincubation at 38°C followed by 45 min of chase revealed diminished vacuolar staining and the appearance of punctate structures ( Fig . 2 , 38°C , 30 min ) . When a 1 - h preshift to 38°C preceded the labeling , the majority of the signal was restricted within punctate structures ( Fig . 2 , 38°C , 60 min ) . Even after 2 . 5 h of chase , the signal was still observed in the punctate struc - tures and did not chase to the vacuolar membrane ( data not shown ) . A temperature - dependent phenotype for a deletion strain was not expected , but has been reported for other deletions ( e . g . , temperature - sensitive polarized se - cretion in tpml - A ; Liu and Bretscher , 1992 ) . In addition , when the dim mutants are incubated at elevated tempera - tures , only a single large vacuole is seen rather than the three to five smaller vacuoles that are observed in wild - type and complemented mutant cells ( Fig . 2 ) . However , processing and sorting of the soluble vacuolar hydrolase carboxypeptidase Y is normal in both dim mutants ( data not shown ) , indicating that their ER to vacuole transport pathway is unaffected . As anticipated , based on the selec - tion scheme used for their isolation , dirnl - A and dim2 - 1 cells exhibited approximately two - to fourfold reduced flu - orescent intensity of FM4 - 64 at 38°C when compared to The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 135 , 1996 1488 Figure 2 . FM4 - 64 labeling of wild - type and dim mutants . SEY6210 ( wild - type ) , BWY6 ( diml - A ) with or without complementing pDIM1 plasmid , and BWY10 ( dim2 - 1 ) with or without complementing pDIM2 plasmid cells were labeled at 26°C for 20 min , followed by a 90 - min chase , and were preincubated at 38°C for 30 min , labeled for 10 min , and chased for 45 min ; or were preineubated at 38°C for 1 h , labeled for 10 min , and chased for 45 min . Images were acquired under identical conditions to compare fluorescent intensities . Vacuoles ( V ) are indicated in Nomarski panels of the uncomplemented dim mutants . Bar , 5 ~ m . the intensity of wild type cells , and this internalization de - fect was rescued by the presence of the DIM1 or DIM2 cloned genes , respectively . The dim phenotype is consistent with defects in the traf - ficking of bulk lipid . As an alternative assay for endocytic defects in diml - Zl and dim2 - 1 mutants , internalization of the yeast - mating pheromone oL - factor serves as a simple measure of receptor - mediated endocytosis ( Dulic et al . , 1991 ) . In this experiment , a - factor was bound to the sur - face of the cells , and internalization was initiated at time 0 by the addition of glucose . At 38°C , diml - A cells had a two to threefold reduction in the kinetics of a - factor internal - ization relative to that observed in diml - A cells at 26°C or in wild - type cells ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) . The initial rate of inter - nalization appeared to be even slower in the dim2 - 1 mu - tant at 38°C ( Fig . 3 C ) . These defects were rescued to nearly wild type kinetic rates when diml - A or dim2 - 1 cells harboring complementing plasmid were assayed ( data not shown ) . Further analysis of a - factor internalization in diml - A cells involved examining the fate of internalized a - factor . In wild type cells , internalized cx - factor is delivered to the vacuole , where it is degraded by vacuolar proteases ( Singer and Riezman , 1990 ) . Consequently , the arrival of a - factor in the vacuole is monitored by assessing its degradation . Internalization of radiolabeled a - factor experiments were performed , followed by processing for TLC to visualize c ~ - factor degradation . In diml - A cells , at a permissive tem - perature , cell - associated cx - factor was cleared / internalized nearly as rapidly as in wild - type cells ( Fig . 4 , A and B , lanes 1 - 8 ) . When the cells were incubated at 38°C for 30 min before internalization , however , the a - factor in diml - A cells was stabilized in the intact form ( Fig . 4 , A and B , lanes 11 and 12 ) and very little cx - factor was observed in Wendland et al .

At the indicated time points , ali - quots were withdrawn and diluted in ice - cold buffer at pH 6 . 2 ( total a - factor , sur - face - bound plus internalized ) or pH 1 . 1 ( internalized a - fac - tor , acid wash to dissociate surface - bound a - factor ) . The samples were then filtered , counted by scintillation , and the results were plotted as the ratio of pH 1 / pH6 counts for each time point to repre - sent the percent of internal - ized a - factor . The data repre - sent the average of two experiments . the internal fraction of these cells ( Fig . 4 B , lanes 13 - 16 ) . Together , these experiments indicate that dim mutants ex - hibit a significant reduction in the endocytosis of both bulk lipids and o ~ - factor , and that these defects are exaggerated at a high temperature . Cloning and Characterization of the DIMI and DIM2 Genes : Identity with SHE4 and PAN1 The DIM1 gene was cloned by complementation of the temperature sensitive for growth phenotype of the dim1 - 1 mutant . To do this , dim1 - 1 cells were first transformed with a genomic CEN - LEU2 library ( Rose et al . , 1987 ) and plated at 26°C . Colonies were then replica plated and grown at 26°C or 38°C . Colonies that could survive at 38°C were chosen , and plasmid DNA was rescued from them . Three distinct but overlapping library plasmids that were capable of rescuing the growth defect were subjected to restriction mapping , and a region of overlap was deter - mined . A minimum complementing BglII / BamHI frag - ment ( Fig . 5 A ) rescued both the growth and the FM4 - 64 internalization defects of diml - 1 cells . Both strands of this Figure 4 . Degradation of internalized a - factor . ( A ) BWY17 ( wild - type ) or ( B ) BWY9 ( diml - A ) cells were treated as indicated in Fig . 3 , but rather than filtering the samples for scintillation , they were pelleted , washed , and lysed to recover internalized a - factor . The samples were resolved by thin - layer chromatogra - phy to differentiate mature from degraded a - factor . fragment were sequenced , and a single large open reading frame of 789 amino acids was detected . Analysis of the DIM1 gene predicted a hydrophilic pro - tein sequence . Database searches indicated small regions of similarity to the yeast dynamin - like protein Dnmlp ( Gammie et al . , 1995 ) and also to the carboxy - terminal re - gion of the Caenorhabditis elegans open reading frame yk44f2 . 5 , which predicts a 961 - amino acid protein with 38 % identity to heat shock protein - binding immunophil - ins ( Callebaut et al . , 1992 ) in the amino - terminal 43 - 115 residues . During the course of this work , SHE4 , isolated as a gene necessary for Swi5p - dependent HO expression , was reported in the database ( Jansen et al . , 1996 ) , as was the chromosome XV open reading frame OR26 . 26 ( Saccharo - myces Genome Database ) . Both are identical to DIM1 , with the exception that SHE4 is predicted to encode a 791 - amino acid protein . This difference is likely caused ei - ther by strain variations or sequencing errors . Hereafter , DIM1 will be referred to as SHE4 and the diml - 1 allele as she4 - 1 . Integrative mapping confirmed that the SHE4 gene cor - responded to the she4 - 1 locus . To determine if SHE4 was essential , a disruption construct in which 92 % of the SHE4 gene was replaced by the HIS3 gene was generated ( Fig . 5 A ) . The construct was used to disrupt one genomic copy of SHE4 in a wild - type diploid strain . The resulting strain was then sporulated , and 20 tetrads were dissected . Ger - mination of the meiotic products at 30°C yielded four via - ble haploid colonies ( data not shown ) , indicating that SHE4 is not an essential gene . We also constructed hap - loid she4 - A null strains that , like she4 - 1 , are temperature sensitive for growth ( Fig . 5 B ) and display the dim pheno - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 135 , 1996 1490 Figure 5 .

The growth defect and dim phenotypes are rescued in she4 - zi cells that harbor a complementing plas - mid ( Figs . 2 and 5 B ) . The DIM2 gene was isolated by complementation of the growth defect in dim2 - 1 cells at 38°C . Two distinct library plasmids that rescued the growth defect were analyzed by restriction mapping and contained a common region of overlapping sequence . The largest clone , which fully com - plemented the mutant , is schematized in Fig . 6 A . Several regions of the clone were sequenced . Comparison with the database revealed identity to a previously characterized essential gene of unknown function , PAN1 ( Sachs and Deardorff , 1992 ; Boeck et al . , 1996 ) , and also to the chro - mosome IX open reading frame YIR006C ( Voss et al . , 1995 ) . PAN1 was originally thought to encode a poly - A - specific nuclease , but was recently reported to be a contaminant in the purification of Pan2p , the true nuclease ( Boeck et al . , 1996 ) . PANt has also been isolated recently in other screens for mitochondrial protein - targeting mutants ( Zoladek et al . , 1995 ) and rapid - death mutants with cdc28 - 4 ( Tang and Cai , 1996 ) .

Addition of 1 M sorbitol to the growth media suppressed the growth defect at 38°C both for she4 - A and dim2 - 1 ( data not shown ) . Hereafter , DIM2 will be referred to as PAN1 , and the dim2 - 1 allele as pan1 - 20 . Integrative mapping confirmed the identity of the pan1 - 20 locus with the PAN1 gene . Disruption of the PAN1 gene with the HIS3 gene ( Fig . 6 A ) in a wild - type diploid strain followed by tetrad analysis confirmed the essential nature of the PAN1 gene , as reported by Sachs and Deardorff ( 1992 ) . Dissection of the tetrads onto 1 M sorbitol plates did not permit germination of the spores ( data not shown ) . Interestingly , Panlp was found to contain two EH e ( _ ~ psl5 homology ) domains with 30 - - 40 % identity to similar do - mains in epsl5 ( Fazioli et al . , 1993 ; Wong et al . , 1995 ) . In addition to containing EH domains , the two proteins also share a similar overall structure : both proteins include EH domains at their amino termini , central portions with a high probability of forming coiled coils , and carboxy - ter - minal , proline - rich domains with hallmarks of SH3 - bind - ing proteins ( Wong et al . , 1995 ; Fig . 6 C in this paper ) . Other yeast proteins containing EH domains include End3p ( Benedetti et al . , 1994 ) , as well as the S . cerevisiae open reading frames YBL047c , YKR019c , and YJL083w . Comparison of the overall domain structure of mamma - lian epsl5 with YBL047c and Panlp ( Fig . 6 C ) suggests that epsl5 is more similar to YBL047c than it is to Panlp . We constructed a deletion of YBL047c , which has no as - signed function , and have found that the deletion strain is viable and no obvious growth defects have been detected ( our unpublished data ) . SHE4 and PAN1 Interact with Other Genes Involved in Endocytosis Munn and Riezman ( 1994 ) recently described a screen in which endocytosis mutants were isolated by selecting for mutants that exhibited synthetic lethality in combination with vacuolar ATPase ( v - ATPase ) mutants . This screen was based on the fact that v - ATPase mutants require acidic media for viability and the supposition that viability is dependent on vacuole acidification via endocytosis of protons ( Nelson and Nelson , 1990 ) . We asked whether the dim mutants also fell into this class of endocytosis mutants . VMA4 encodes a subunit of the v - ATPase ( Ho et al . , Table II .

All strains were tested on rich YPD plat ~ s , except the strains con - taining vma4 - A alleles , which were grown on MES - buffered YPD plates , pH 5 . 5 . In each case , the single mutants grew nearly as well as the wild type at all temperatures reported in this table . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 135 , 1996 1492 1993 ) , and a vma4 - A strain is deficient in v - ATPase func - tion . she4 - A vma4 - A and pan1 - 20 vma4 - A heterozygous diploids were sporulated and dissected , and synthetic le - thality was observed in spores that were deduced to har - bor both mutations , consistent with the endocytosis de - fects observed in the dim mutants ( Table II ) . Synthetic growth defects often are used as an argument to place gene products the same or parallel pathways . We observed synthetic growth defects in strains harboring both she4 - A and the temperature - sensitive endocytosis mutant alleles end4 - 1 ( Raths et al . , 1993 ) or actl - 1 ( Shortle et al . , 1984 ; Novick and Botstein , 1985 ; Munn et al . , 1995 ) . Also , panl - 20 in combination with end4 - 1 or act1 - 1 yielded strains that grew more poorly than strains containing sin - gle mutations ( Table II ) . Furthermore , synthetic growth defects were observed in double mutants between she4 - A and panl - 3 ( Sachs and Deardorff , 1992 ) , and also with she4 - za and chc - ts ( Tan et al . , 1993 ; Table II in this paper ) . These data are indicative of a role for the SHE4 and PAN1 gene products in endocytosis ( also see Discussion ) . Actin Cytoskeleton Structure Is Altered in she4 - A and panl - 20 Cells The actin cytoskeleton is intimately involved in the pro - cess of endocytosis in yeast ( Kubler and Riezman , 1993 ; Munn et al . , 1995 ) . Actin localization in yeast cells changes as a function of cell cycle progression , and patches of fila - mentous actin ( actin cortical dots ) at the plasma mem - brane coincide with sites of synthesis of new cell wall ma - terial in budding cells and with secretion of a - agglutinin in shmooing ( mating ) cells ( Adams and Pringle , 1984 ; Kil - martin and Adams , 1984 ) . The normal polarized localiza - tion of actin is disrupted in many previously described en - docytosis mutants ( Benedetti et al . , 1994 ; Munn et al . , 1995 ) , so we examined the structure and polarity of the ac - tin cytoskeleton in the she4 - A and panl - 20 cells . Wild - type , she4 - A , and panl - 20 diploid cells were fixed and then incubated with rhodamine - phalloidin to label fil - amentous actin . In she4 - A cells , we observed a loss of po - larity of actin localization at both 26°C ( Fig . 7 A ) and 38°C ( data not shown ) . The cells also adopted a round morphol - ogy at all temperatures , similar to that seen with actl - 1 mutant cells ( Novick and Botstein , 1985 ) , and consistent with a loss of polarized secretion and a switch to isotropic growth . Normal elongated cell morphology and polarity of actin cortical spots were restored in a she4 - A strain harbor - ing a complementing plasmid ( Fig . 7 A ) . panl - 20 diploid cells revealed slightly disrupted actin polarity at 26°C , with a few more cortical spots found in the mother cells relative to wild - type cells ( data not shown ) , and the cells were rounder than wild - type cells , consistent with the mislocalization of actin spots . After in - cubation at 38°C for 2 . 5 h , the morphology of the actin cy - toskeleton became markedly perturbed : thick , curved ac - tin bundles appeared to be adjacent to the cell periphery , and polarity of the cortical spots was lost ( Fig . 7 B ) . Mislo - calization of actin in a panl allele was also recently re - ported by Tang and Cai ( Tang and Cai , 1996 ) . In addition , actin structures did not display the wild type double band of cortical dots at the neck during cytokinesis and instead adopted a filamentous appearance with a larger amount of actin directed toward the smaller ( presumably daughter ) cell . Actin polarity and cell shape were restored to a wild - type appearance when panl - 20 cells harbored a comple - menting plasmid ( Fig . 7 B ) . Budding yeast exhibit stereotypic patterns of bud site selection : haploid cells bud in an axial pattern in which the next budding event occurs adjacent to the previous one , whereas diploid cells can bud from either pole of their el - Figure 7 .

Haploid she4 - A and pan1 - 20 cells were capable of normal axial budding as seen in wild - type cells ; however , in diploid she4 - A and pan1 - 20 cells , the budding pattern became random ( data not shown ) . The same diploid - specific alterations in bud site selection are also observed in other endocytosis mu - tants such as end3 ( Benedetti et al . , 1994 ) , rvs161 / end6 ( Si - vadon et al . , 1995 ) , and rvs167 ( Bauer et al . , 1993 ) . Ultrastructural Analysis of she4 - A and pan1 - 20 Cells Reveals Vesicles and Tubulovesicular Membranes When the dim mutants are examined with the light micro - scope for FM4 - 64 internalization and localization of fila - mentous actin , defects that may correlate with morpholog - ical aberrations are observed . EM was performed to examine more closely the structure of these mutants . In the she4 - A cells , EM revealed the presence of 100 - nm vesi - cles in the cytoplasm at both 26°C ( Fig . 8 , B and C ) and 38°C ( Fig . 8 , D - G ) , whereas in wild - type cells , such struc - tures are rarely detected ( Fig . 8 A ) . Additional tubulove - sicular compartments reminiscent of early endosomes in mammalian cells ( Helenius et al . , 1983 ) , as well as 40 - 50 - nm vesicles , appeared upon incubation at 38°C . These structures may correspond to the punctate staining that is observed in FM4 - 64 labeling after a temperature shift , and they may represent endocytic intermediate compartments . While fewer 50 - and 100 - nm vesicles were observed , simi - lar endosomal - like structures were also seen in the pan1 - 20 cells after incubation at 38°C , whereas they were absent in pan1 - 20 cells containing a complementing plasmid ( data not shown ) . In many cases , the 100 - nm vesicles observed in the she4 - A cells at 26°C appeared to have associated coats ( Fig . 8 C ) . These vesicles are unlikely to correspond to classical post - Golgi secretory vesicles because sorting and processing of the vacuolar hydrolase carboxypeptidase Y ( Stevens et al . , 1982 ) and secretion of the heat shock protein Hsp150p ( Russo et al . , 1992 ) did not differ from wild - type cells at 26°C or 30°C ( data not shown ) . A partial kinetic defect in secretion of Hspl50p and the periplasmic enzyme inver - tase ( Gascon et al . , 1968 ) was observed at 38°C ; however , this may be caused by lack of growth at 38°C ( data not shown ) . she4 - A Vesicles Are Unlikely to Be Clathrin - coated Vesicles Given the established role for clathrin heavy chain in en - docytosis ( Tan et al . , 1993 ) , we tested if the 100 - nm coated vesicles observed in the she4 - A cells were clathrin coated . After the protocol of Mueller and Branton ( 1984 ) , light membranes isolated from wild - type or she4 - A cells grown at 30°C were fractionated by size on an S - 1000 Sephacryl column ( Fig . 9 , A and B ) . A 280 - nm absorbance peak was observed in fractions 33 - 38 from she4 - A membranes that was not observed from wild - type membranes , suggesting that this peak might correspond to the observed vesicles . To determine the elution position of clathrin - coated vesi - cles , every fifth fraction was assayed by immunoblotting with antibodies to the heavy chain of the clathrin triskel - ion ( Chclp ) . The peak of Chclp elution was not coinci - dent with the large absorbance peak ( Fig . 9 B ) . For further analysis , membranes from fractions 36 - 37 and 45 - 50 were concentrated and prepared for examination by conven - tional EM ( Fig . 9 , C and D ) . Fractions 36 - 37 contained a fairly homogeneous population of 100 - nm vesicles consis - tent with the size of vesicles observed in sections of spheroplasted cells ( Fig . 8 , B and C ) . In contrast , fractions coincident with clathrin immunoreactivity contained a het - erogeneous population of vesicles , including many with coats exhibiting a classic clathrin cagelike coat ( Fig . 9 D , arrowheads ) . Thus it is unlikely that the vesicles in the she4 - A cells represent clathrin - coated vesicles , although they could be vesicles that have lost their coats , vesicles coated with a nonclathrin coat , or endocytic vesicles of an unknown origin . Cationized Ferritin Internalization Reveals Endocytic Structures at the Plasma Membrane To examine the structure and morphology of the en - docytic pathway at the ultrastructural level , internalization of cationized ferritin was assayed . This is a commonly used method for following the endocytic pathway in mamma - lian cells ( Ottosen et al . , 1980 ; Herzog and Farquhar , 1983 ) , but had not yet been used in yeast . Yeast cells were spher - oplasted in an osmotically supported environment and preincubated at permissive or nonpermissive tempera - tures for 30 - 60 min , followed by incubation with cation - ized ferritin for 30 min . Ferritin accumulation was ob - served in numerous plasma membrane invaginations in she4 - A cells at 30°C ( Fig . 10 , A and B ) and 38°C ( Fig . 10 C ) and in pan1 - 3 ( Fig . 10 D ) and end4 - 1 cells at 38°C ( data not shown ) . In wild - type cells , roughly half as many invag - inations ( 0 . 46 invaginations per micrometer of plasma mem - brane , wild type ; 0 . 81 invaginations per micrometer of plasma membrane , she4 - A ) that were significantly shal - lower ( 0 . 08 + / - 0 . 03 pbm , wild type ; 0 . 16 + / - 0 . 04 p ~ m , she4 - A ) and that only rarely contained cationized ferritin labeling were observed . In addition , in she4 - A cells at 30°C , membranous compartments within the cell that may represent endocytic intermediates that appear to have sep - arated from the cell surface were observed ( Fig . 10 B ) . As seen in wild - type cells , end4 - 1 at a permissive temperature exhibited fewer , rarely labeled membrane invaginations and membranous compartments ( data not shown ) . In pan1 - 3 cells , compared to the isogenic wild - type strain at elevated temperature , we observed five times as many in - vaginations ( 0 . 55 invaginations per micrometer of plasma membrane , pan1 - 3 ; 0 . 11 invaginations per micrometer of plasma membrane , PAN1 ) that extended > 10 times deeper into the cell ( 0 . 43 + / - 0 . 15 ~ m , panl - 3 ; 0 . 03 + / - 0 . 02 ~ m , PAN1 ) . In general , the membrane invaginations in the mutants were deeper and often more elaborate at the high temperature than at the lower , permissive temperatures . The cationized ferritin - labeled plasma membrane invagi - nations have a morphology that appears to be distinct from that of actin cortical dots ( Mulholland et al . , 1994 ) .

These two temperature - sensitive dim mutants exhibit defects in internalization of the lipophilic dye FM4 - 64 , they display reduced kinetics of a - factor internalization as com - pared to wild - type cells , and they also exhibit altered actin localization . Previously characterized mutants in the early steps of endocytosis share these general phenotypes with the dim mutants . Synthetic growth defects between the dim mutants and other endocytosis mutants are consistent with these gene products acting at similar stages in endocytosis . Both dim mutants also accumulated vesicles and aberrant membranous compartments with morphology reminiscent of mammalian early endosomes . In contrast , neither mu - tant yielded significant defects in secretory function . This new screening technique has thus allowed the identifica - tion of new genes involved in endocytosis . In addition , the usefulness of FM4 - 64 - based FACS ® screening for mutants in yeast was also recently demonstrated by Wang et al . ( 1996 ) in a search for mutants defective in vacuolar inher - itance . The yeast actin cytoskeleton is known to play an impor - tant role in endocytosis . Endocytosis mutants almost in - variably exhibit disorganized actin cytosketetons ; and not surprisingly , many mutants with a perturbed actin cyto - skeleton exhibit defects in endocytosis ( Kubler and Riez - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 135 , 1996 1496 Figure 10 . Cationized ferritin intemalizationiad / m mutants . ( A - C ) BWY6 ( she4 - A ) and ( D ) YASlll5 ( pan1 - 3 ) cells were spheroplasted in 1 . 2 M sorbitol for osmotic support and lareiae ~ aated at 30°C ( A and B ) or 38°C ( C and D ) for 30 min , followed by incubation with 1 mg / ml cationized ferritin ( arrowheads ) ~ or 30 rain . The cells were then fixed and examined by EM . Arrowheads , internalized cationized ferritin ; small arrows , surface - bound ( erriti ~ ; V , vacuole . Bar , 0 . 1 ixm . man , 1993 ; Munn et al . , 1995 ) . In yeast , the actin cytoskel - eton is comprised of fine cytoplasmic cables and cortical actin dots that correlate with sites of secretion and cell growth ( Adams and Pringle , 1984 ) . The identity of the thick actin bundles observed m the panl - 20 cells at 38°C and their possible relationship to actin cortical dots or other actin - based complexes remains to be clarified . The structure of actin cortical dots , which has been described as a fingerlike invagination of plasma membrane sur - rounded by actin filaments ( Mulholland et al . , 1994 ) , and perhaps the structure of other membrane invaginations are suggestive of their role as a reservoir of membrane that can be used for secretion , endocytosis , and responses to osmotic changes . The observation that dim and end mu - tant cells exhibit an enlarged and rounded morphology suggests that the restricted sites for exocytosis and / or the normal balance between exocytosis and endocytosis are perturbed . It has been proposed that these two processes are coordinated through the homeostasis of membrane tension ( Sheetz and Dai , 1996 ) . The actin cytoskeleton is important for establishing the distinction between mother and daughter cells during budding . This developmental asymmetry is exemplified by the process of mating - type switching : only mother cells are capable of mating - type switching in wild - type strains ( Nasmyth , 1993 ) , while she mutants exhibit defects in this asymmetry and in mating - type switching ( Jansen et al . , 1996 ) . The fact that mutations in SHE4 / DIM1 cause defects both in mating - type switching and in endocytosis ( Figs . 2 - 4 ) may reflect the importance of the actin cytoskeleton in each of these processes . In addition , the identification of SHE1 as MY04 suggests a role for actin / myosin interactions in di - recting traffic from the mother cell to the daughter cell ( Jansen et al . , 1996 ; see also Johnston et al . , 1991 ; Govin - dan et al . , 1995 ) . It is possible that the block of mating - type switching in the she4 mutant is an indirect conse - quence of the mislocalization of actin cables and cortical spots . Actin polarization may be required for the proper asymmetric localization of factors that regulate mating - type switching ( Jansen et al . , 1996 ) . While presently there are no known homologues to She4p , there are several proteins in yeast and mammalian cells with very significant homology to Panlp / Dim2p , in - cluding epsl5 ( Wong et al . , 1995 ) . The mammalian protein epsl5 was first discovered as a phosphorylated substrate of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase ( Fazioli et al . , 1993 ) . epsl5 is comprised of three domains : three imperfect tan - dem repeats in the amino terminus ( EH domains ) , a cen - tral domain rich in heptad repeats that are predicted to form coiled coils , and a carboxy - terminal proline - rich re - gion , a portion of which has been shown to interact with the SH3 domains contained within the signaling molecule crk ( Schumacher et al . , 1995 ) . The carboxy terminus of epsl5 also contains a 72 - amino acid domain that is distinct from the crk - binding motif , which has been demonstrated to interact constitutively with the plasma membrane adap - tor complex AP2 ( Benmerah et al . , 1995 , 1996 ) . The inter - action between epsl5 and AP2 is intriguing because AP2 interacts with clathrin to promote clathrin - coated pit as - sembly at the plasma membrane ( Smythe et al . , 1992 ) , thus Wendland et al . Yeast Endocytosis Mutants 1497 providing a connection between eps15 and endocytosis . Panlp and the yeast YBL047c protein share extensive struc - tural similarity with eps15 , each containing coiled - coil and proline - rich domains ( Fig . 6 ) . The proline - rich domains of Panlp and the YBL047c protein are likely to interact with SH3 domain - - containing proteins ( Ren et al . , 1993 ; Yu et al . , 1994 ) ; several candidates include proteins associated with the actin cytoskeleton ( e . g . , Abplp Drubin et al . , 1990 and Slalp Holtzman et al . , 1993 ) and proteins implicated in endocytosis ( e , g . , Rvs167p Bauer et al . , 1993 ; Munn et al . , 1995 and Myo3p Goodson and Spudich , 1995 ; Geli and Riezman , 1996 ) . An additional correlation between epsl5 and endocytosis is provided by the presence of EH do - mains in the yeast proteins End3p and Panlp ( Benedetti et al . , 1994 ; Wong et al . , 1995 ) . EH domain - - containing proteins have been proposed to function in endocytosis or at other sites of membrane trafficking ( Seaman et al . , 1996 ) . Clearly , an area of great interest is the identification of other molecules that interact with each of these struc - tural motifs . Endocytosis in yeast has been particularly difficult to study morphologically , partly because of the uncharacter - ized structure of the endosomal membrane system in this organism . It is interesting to speculate on the identity of the tubulovesicular structures that accumulate in the dim mutants . These structures accumulated after shifts to ele - vated temperatures ( Fig . 8 ) , correlating well with the ap - pearance of punctate staining in FM4 - 64 - 1abeling experi - ments ( Fig . 2 ) . Further studies will be necessary to equate these two compartments unambiguously . It is intriguing to compare these structures with the tubulovesicular early endosomes that are observed in mammalian cells ( Helenius et al . , 1983 ) . Our results with cationized ferritin provide a view of early internalization structures in yeast ( Fig . 10 ) . However , additional high resolution probes and tech - niques will be required to define each of the endocytic in - termediates in yeast . Several lines of evidence in both yeast and mammalian cells suggest the presence of two or more endocytic path - ways ( Sandvig and van Deurs , 1994 ) . It has been shown in mammalian cells that different receptors rely upon distinct pathways for their endocytosis : the EGF receptor enters cells via clathrin - coated pits ( Willingham and Pastan , 1982 ) , while the folate receptor is internalized through a clathrin - independent pathway ( Rothberg et al . , 1990 ) . It has also been shown that mammalian cells disrupted in the dynamin / clathrin - - coated pit pathway upregulate an alter - nate endocytic pathway ( Damke et al . , 1995 ) . In yeast , chcl - / t strains are viable and endocytose FM4 - 64 ( data not shown ) and a - factor receptor ( Payne et al . , 1987 , 1988 ) , suggesting that two or more endocytic pathways in yeast may also exist . In addition , a dim phenotype was observed when the end3 - 1 and end4 - 1 strains were tested for FM4 - 64 internalization ( data not shown ) . This suggests that a block in internalization of mating pheromone receptor is not sufficient to completely block all flow from the plasma membrane into the cell . The synthetic growth defects we observed in double endocytosis mutants are also consis - tent with a multiple endocytic pathway model . Addition - ally , because act1 - 1 displays both endocytic and late secre - tory defects , it remains possible that the synthetic growth defects observed in actl - 1 / dim mutants are in part caused by perturbations of secretory function in the dim mutants . chcl - ts mutants also display multiple membrane traffick - ing defects , including deficiencies in vacuolar protein sort - ing and endocytosis . However , since the vacuolar protein sorting pathway is normal in dim mutants , the synthetic defect observed in chc - ts / dirn double mutants is a likely re - sult of combined endocytosis deficits . Finally , synthetic de - fects between secretory and endocytic mutants in general might be expected if these two processes are tightly cou - pled . As increasing numbers of proteins that mediate endocy - tosis in yeast are discovered , a need arises for an under - standing of the precise functions of each of these proteins , how they are regulated , and how they interact with one an - other . Future studies will include the use of this FM4 - 64 screening strategy for the identification of additional en - docytosis mutants . Genetic and two - hybrid screens will shed light on interacting partners that might establish pathways in endocytic membrane traffic . In vitro assays should allow for the purification of activities that are nec - essary for internalization and subsequent stages of mem - brane traffic . Through the use of these screens and other approaches , it should be possible to identify biologically significant interactions among relevant gene products , and to decipher molecular mechanisms for the control of en - docytosis in eukaryotic cells .
