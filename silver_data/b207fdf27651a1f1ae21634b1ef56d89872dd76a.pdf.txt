As a simple extension of a standard polymer model – the wormlike chain ( WLC ) – the GWLC describes the time - dependent rheological properties of cells as well as semiﬂexible polymer networks by modeling the interactions of a test chain with its soft environment via an exponential stretching of the WLC mode relaxation spectrum . In particular the WLC mode relaxation times τ WLC n = ζ ⊥ / ( κπ 4 / λ 4 n + fπ 2 / λ 2 n ) are stretched according to : τ GWLC n =   τ WLC n if λ n ≤ Λ τ WLC n e εN n if λ n > Λ . ( 1 ) Here , λ n = L / n is the ( half - ) wavelength of the n - th mode , L the contour length of the test ﬁlament , Λ the typical distance between two interactions , f describes a homogeneous backbone tension accounting for existing pre - stress , ζ ⊥ the transverse drag coeﬃcient , and κ the bending rigidity which is related to the ﬁlament’s persistence length l p via κ = l p k B T . The number N n = λ n / Λ − 1 of interaction points associated to the n - th mode is set to 0 for modes shorter than Λ . ε is the stretching parameter controlling how strong the modes are slowed down by interactions with the environment . The physical picture behind this scheme is that of a test polymer diﬀusing in a rough free energy landscape created by the surrounding polymers . In this picture the interactions correspond to the wells of this landscape separated by energy barriers of typical height ε . The GWLC mode relaxation spectrum given in equation 1 can then be introduced in a consistent way by assuming that in the considered free energy landscape the mode - number - dependent friction is given by : ζ ⊥ ( n ) =    ζ ⊥ if λ n ≤ Λ ζ ⊥ e εN n if λ n > Λ . ( 2 ) 8 Linear rheology In the frequency domain , the micro - rheological , linear response function χ ( ω ) of the GWLC to a point force at its ends can be expressed as the sum of mode contributions : χ ( ω ) = L 4 π 4 l 2p k B T ∞ X n = 1 1 ( n 4 + n 2 f / f E ) ( 1 + iωτ GWLC n / 2 ) . ( 3 ) From χ ( ω ) , the complex linear modulus G ∗ ( ω ) in the high frequency limit can be obtained assuming aﬃne deformations : G ∗ ( ω ) = Λ 5 ξ 2 χ ( ω ) . ( 4 ) Within these expressions , f E = κπ 2 / L 2 is the Euler buckling force and ξ denotes the mesh size . The sum converges rapidly for λ n > Λ so that high precision can be obtained by adding a small number of mode contributions . Non - linear rheology To model inelastic ﬁlament lengthening , we assume that the increase of the ﬁlaments contour length is related to a slippage of proto - ﬁlaments , which requires the opening of transient bonds between proto - ﬁlaments or the unfolding of protein domains . Following standard procedures [ 2 ] based on the Bell - Evans - model [ 3 ] , we represent the force dependent dynamics of such weak reversible binding mechanisms ( to which we refer as bonds ) via a ﬁrst order rate equation for the time dependent probability ν ( t , f ) that a bond is found in the closed state in the presence of an external force f : ˙ ν ( t , f ) = − k - ( f ) ν ( t , f ) + k + ( f ) ( 1 − ν ( t , f ) ) , ( 5 ) where the force dependency of the transition rates k - ( f ) and k + ( f ) is chosen according to the Bell model [ 4 ] : k - ( f ) = k 0 · e ∆ E + β ∆ x c f ( 6 ) k + ( f ) = k 0 · e ∆ E − β ∆ x o f + U , ( 7 ) where k 0 is a microscopic attempt rate . The underlying picture of this description bonds is an ensemble of virtual particles diﬀusing in an asymmetric bimodal potential ( Fig . S6 ) . The two energy minima at x = 0 and x = ∆ x o + ∆ x c describe the closed and the open state of 9 the bond , respectively . The energetic minimum representing the closed state minimum is set to zero and that of open state to U . The two minima are separated by an energy barrier of height ∆ E at x = ∆ x c . To link ν ( t , f ) to the GWLC we replace the constant contour length L by a contour length L ( ν ( t , f ) ) that depends on the state of the bonds . In particular we choose a linear coupling : L → L ( ν ∞ ( t , f ) ) = L 0 [ 1 + S ( ν ∞ ( 0 , 0 ) − ν ∞ ( t , f ) ) ] , ( 8 ) where S is the coupling constant . This simplifying ansatz ( Eq . 8 ) rests on the assumption that L ( ν ∞ ( t , f ) ) has the character of a slow variable . It is employed because here , we are only interested in a minimal description whereas the full problem of combining a description of a weak reversible binding mechanism with a polymer model on microscopic grounds is in general very complicated and beyond the scope of this paper . Further we consider only the limit of an externally applied forces changing slowly compared to 1 / ( k 0 exp ( ∆ E ) ) so that ν ( t , f ) has enough time to equilibrate and thus , is well approximated by the time - independent equilibrium value ν eq ( f ) : ν eq ( f ) = ( 1 + exp [ − U + ∆ xf ] ) − 1 , ( 9 ) with ∆ x = ∆ x c + ∆ x o . Combining Eq . 9 with Eq . 8 yields an expression for a force - dependent ﬁlament length L ( f ) then reads : L ( f ) = L 0 " 1 + S · sinh ( f ∆ x / 2 ) cosh ( U − f ∆ x / 2 ) + sinh ( f ∆ x / 2 ) # . ( 10 ) which can be plugged in the description of the diﬀerential modulus described above . The resulting diﬀerential modulus then shows an initial softening regime , caused by an increasing L ( f ) as observed in the experiments . SUPPORTING REFRENCES [ 1 ] K . Kroy and J .
