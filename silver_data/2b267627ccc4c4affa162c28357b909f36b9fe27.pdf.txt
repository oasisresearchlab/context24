DN is also associated with intrarenal overactivation of the renin – angiotensin system ( RAS ) , an enzymatic cascade which is expressed and controlled at the cell and / or tissue levels . All members of the RAS are present in the kidneys and most of them are also expressed in monocytes / macrophages . This review focuses on the control of monocyte recruitment and the modulation of macrophage polarization by the RAS in the context of DN . The local RAS favors the adhesion of monocytes on renal endothelial cells and increases the production of monocyte chemotactic protein - 1 and of osteopontin in tubular cells , driving monocytes into the kidneys . There , proinﬂammatory cytokines and the RAS promote the differentiation of macrophages into the M1 proinﬂammatory phenotype , largely contributing to renal lesions of DN . Finally , resolution of the inﬂammatory process is associated with a phenotype switch of macrophages into the M2 anti - inﬂammatory subset , which protects against DN . The pharmacologic interruption of the RAS reduces albuminuria , improves the trajectory of the renal function , decreases macrophage inﬁltration in the kidneys and promotes the switch of the macrophage phenotype from M1 to M2 . Keywords : macrophages ; renin – angiotensin system ; diabetic nephropathy 1 . Introduction Sustained fasting glycemia over 7 . 00 mmol / L is the deﬁnition of diabetes mellitus that may result either from insulin deﬁciency following insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) or from insulin deﬁciency caused by destruction of beta cells in the pancreatic islets in type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) . Diabetic nephropathy ( DN ) is the leading cause of end - stage renal disease in the world and is considered an inﬂammatory disease . This is illustrated by renal inﬁltration of monocytes originating from the bone marrow and by lower occur - rence of kidney lesions observed in experimental studies targeting disruption of mono - cytes / macrophages [ 1 ] . The inﬂammatory process is initiated by poor glycemic control and / or high level of albuminuria . Peripheral monocytes enter the kidneys , differentiate into macrophages of diverse phenotypes and their abundancy parallels the renal ﬁbrosis , which negatively correlates with the renal function [ 2 ] .

Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6009 2 of 21 Diabetic nephropathy is also characterized by activation of the renin – angiotensin system ( RAS ) . The RAS is an enzymatic cascade which produces various types of an - giotensins [ 3 ] . At the systemic level , the RAS regulates the arterial tone and the extracellular ﬂuid volume . At the tissue level , the differential expression of the key enzymes and of their receptors may lead to various effects , even to opposite effects [ 4 ] . There is a complete RAS intrinsic to the kidneys [ 5 , 6 ] and some components of the RAS intrinsic to the mono - cyte / macrophage system [ 7 , 8 ] . They both have a dual role . In DN , activated components of the RAS turn out to be harmful : they are proinﬂammatory , proﬁbrotic and they enhance the oxidative stress . The bulk of experimental data shows that stimulation of the antagonistic components of the RAS may protect against the lesions of DN . In humans , however , only the pharmacological interruptions of the deleterious compounds are efﬁcient [ 9 , 10 ] . In reality , blockade of the activated harmful RAS components in humans decreases blood pressure and albuminuria and improves the trajectory of the renal function [ 11 ] . Here , we review the interactions of the kidneys and the monocyte / macrophage system through the RAS in DN in order to highlight the potential treatments available . 2 . Pathophysiology of DN 2 . 1 . Renal Function Consequences of DN The onset of DN is characterized by the increase in renal size and weight because the tubules and the glomeruli develop hyperplasia and hypertrophy [ 12 ] . As a result , the proximal tubule reabsorbs a higher amount of sodium via sodium – glucose cotrans - porter type 2 ( SGLT2 ) , leading to afferent arteriole vasodilation and sustained glomerular hyperﬁltration . Glomerular hyperﬁltration favors hypertension , renal function loss and albuminuria [ 13 , 14 ] . Albuminuria is measured by the urinary albumin over creatinine ratio ( UACR ) . Microalbuminuria is deﬁned by the UACR from 20 mg / g to 300 mg / g in women and from 30 mg / g to 300 mg / g in men , and macroalbuminuria is deﬁned by the UACR over 300 mg / g . The renal function is characterized by the glomerular ﬁltration rate ( GFR ) , which is used to deﬁne hyperﬁltration ( GFR > 120 mL / min / 1 . 73 m 2 ) , normal renal function ( 60 ≤ GFR ≤ 120 mL / min / 1 . 73 m 2 ) or renal insufﬁciency ( GFR < 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m 2 ) of varying severity until end - stage renal disease ( GFR < 15 mL / min / 1 . 73 m 2 ) . In contrast with the description of the ﬁve successive stages of DN , which prevailed between the 1980s and the last decade [ 15 ] , it is now established that microalbuminuria does not necessarily develop into macroalbuminuria and that renal insufﬁciency occurs and progresses together with micro - or macroalbuminuria . The pathological classiﬁcation of DN is based on the grade of glomerulosclerosis . The extracellular matrix expansion in the glomeruli starts with the thickening of the basement membrane to end up in the nodular depots inside the glomerular tufts called Kimmerstiel – Wilson nodules , and the pathological classiﬁcation accepts four classes [ 16 ] . However , glomerulosclerosis does not indicate the severity of renal insufﬁciency , which is only revealed by interstitial ﬁbrosis . It is ﬁrmly established that interstitial ﬁbrosis correlates negatively with the renal function in all kinds of nephropathy and most particularly in DN [ 17 – 19 ] . The development of renal ﬁbrosis is a complex and multistep process which results from an imbalance between the production and the degradation of the extracellular matrix [ 20 ] . 2 . 2 . Cellular Consequences of Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia per se is responsible for kidney cell injuries in proximal tubular cells , mesangial cells and endothelial cells . These cells express glucose transporter 2 ( GLUT2 ) and , as a consequence , they experience a high cytoplasmic glucose level due to diffusion from blood down its chemical gradient . Consequently , the glycolytic pathways provide excess energy supply to the mitochondrial respiratory chain and electrons are transferred to oxygen molecules ( O 2 ) rather than to mitochondrial transport molecules ( cytochromes ) , resulting in the overproduction of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . In turn , ROS reduce glycolysis by inhibiting GAPDH and accumulation of glucose metabolites activates the polyol - and the PKC pathways , thereby favoring production of advanced glycation end - Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6009 3 of 21 products ( AGE ) and of N - acetyl glucosamine , leading to renal cell injuries [ 21 ] . In addition , increased intraglomerular pressure due to glomerular hyperﬁltration promotes albumin - uria . Renal production of ROS , glucose metabolites and glycated albumin in urine promote inﬂammation . Indeed , the release of cytokines and danger - associated molecular patterns ( DAMPs ) [ 22 ] and the production of monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1 ( MCP - 1 ) in re - nal cells [ 23 ] attract monocytes from the blood into the kidneys ; these monocytes then differentiate into macrophages . The presence of macrophages in the kidneys is positively correlated with renal ﬁbrosis in humans [ 24 – 26 ] . 2 . 3 . Experimental In Vivo Models of DN Hyperglycemia that initiates DN development can be differentially induced according to diabetic animal models . Several experimental models of DN exist , some mimicking the pathological situations observed in T1D and other reconstituting the context of T2D . Indeed , some mice are hyperglycemic due to insulin deﬁciency , thus recalling the mechanism of T1D . This happens after streptozotocin ( STZ ) administration that destroys beta cells , mutation of the insulin 2 gene that causes abnormal folding of the protein , resulting in beta cell destruction ( AKITA mice ) , or by genetically driven overproduction of calmodulin in beta cells responsible for beta cell destruction ( OVE26 mice ) . Hyperglycemia may also result from insulin resistance . Mutations in the leptin receptor gene ( db / db mice , Zucker diabetic fatty ( ZDF ) rats and Wistar fatty rats ) or in the leptin gene ( ob / ob mice ) or the overexpression of neuropeptide Y in the hypothalamus in Otsuka Long – Evans Tokushima fatty ( OLETF ) rats lead to hyperphagia , obesity and insulin resistance , thus mimicking the pathophysiology of T2D [ 27 , 28 ] . STZ treatment can also mimic the metabolic characteristics of T2D in humans when used in combination with a high - fat diet [ 29 ] and neonatal administration of STZ is a well - established animal model for T2D in rats [ 30 ] . The Animal Models of Diabetic Complications Consortium ( AMDCC ) deﬁnes the key criteria validating a progressive rodent model of DN ( https : / / www . diacomp . org / shared / document . aspx ? id = 25 & docType = Protocol accessed on 28 May 2021 ) : at least 50 % decline in GFR , greater than 10 - fold increase in albuminuria as compared with appropriate controls and ﬁbrosis measured by mesangial sclerosis , arterial hyalinosis , thickening of the glomerular basement membrane to more than 50 % or tubulointerstitial ﬁbrosis [ 16 , 31 ] . Nevertheless , no animal model of DN exhibits all these criteria . For that reason , in the present review , the described models used are speciﬁed and not simply referred to as a T1D or T2D model . As in humans , DN in rodents can be accelerated by concomitant induction of hypertension through the knockout of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) gene [ 32 ] or through the knock - in of the mouse Ren - 2 gene in transgenic ( mREN - 2 ) 27 rats called Ren - 2 rats [ 33 ] . 3 . Roles of Monocytes / Macrophages in DN Tissue - resident macrophages are mostly derived directly from fetal liver or yolk sac during embryogenesis and are described as microglia in the brain , Kupffer cells in the liver and interstitial macrophages in the kidneys . These macrophages are long - lived , do not migrate and are maintained by self - renewal [ 34 ] . In contrast , following infection / injury , circulating monocytes originating from the bone marrow migrate into the injured tis - sue where they differentiate into macrophages [ 35 , 36 ] . These macrophages are called monocyte - derived macrophages or monocyte - derived tissue - resident macrophages and they signiﬁcantly contribute to diabetes - induced kidney injury . Actually , diverse experi - mental strategies aimed at impairing monocyte recruitment into the kidneys or reducing their absolute number in the body decrease renal ﬁbrosis . For instance , tubulin inhibition by colchicine alters diapedesis and signiﬁcantly reduces macrophages and interstitial ﬁbrosis in the kidneys of STZ - treated rats [ 37 ] . Furthermore , the whole - body depletion of mono - cytes / macrophages obtained by intraperitoneal injection of clodronate liposomes [ 38 ] or by the administration of diphtheria toxin in the CD11b - DTR model [ 36 ] reduces macrophage inﬁltration and renal ﬁbrosis in STZ - treated mice . CD11b - DTR ( diphtheria toxin receptor ) Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6009 4 of 21 mice express the transgene insert that contains a fusion product involving DTR and the green ﬂuorescent protein under the control of the human CD11b promoter [ 39 ] . Diphtheria toxin poorly links to murine DTR conferring toxin sensitivity to human DTR speciﬁcally expressed in mouse macrophages . These data clearly indicate that renal accumulation of macrophages is a critical factor in the development of DN ( Table 1 ) . Table 1 .

Monocyte Recruitment in DN Monocytes cross the endothelium layer by diapedesis , a multistep process includ - ing capture , rolling , slow rolling , arrest , adhesion strengthening , lateral locomotion and monocyte transmigration . Diapedesis involves interactions between endothelial cells ex - pressing ICAM - 1 ( intracellular adhesion molecule - 1 ) and VCAM - 1 ( vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 ) and monocyte ligands such as selectins [ 62 ] . In T2D patients , serum ICAM - 1 concentration is higher in the presence of microalbu - minuria than in patients without microalbuminuria [ 63 ] . In the kidneys of db / db mice [ 58 ] or ZDF rats [ 64 ] , ICAM - 1 expression is higher than in their non - diabetic counterparts . Icam - 1 − / − db / db mice [ 58 ] or Icam - 1 − / − STZ - treated mice [ 46 ] show a reduced renal macrophage count ( Table 1 ) . Further , neutralization of ICAM - 1 with a speciﬁc monoclonal antibody in STZ - treated mice reduces the number of glomerular macrophages [ 53 ] . VCAM - 1 is signiﬁcantly more abundant in the urinary proteome of T2D patients as compared to Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6009 6 of 21 people without diabetes [ 65 ] , but the effects of VCAM - 1 depletion on the renal macrophage inﬁltration have not been studied to our knowledge . Immunohistochemistry analysis of kidney biopsies in humans shows that expression of E - and L - selectins is more abundant in renal vessels from the patients with DN than in vessels from the patients with other kinds of nephropathy . The presence of E - selectin in the peritubular capillaries is positively correlated with the renal macrophage count [ 66 ] . In STZ - treated mice , the reduced interaction of L - selectin with its ligands on endothelial cells due to heparan sulfate deﬁciency signiﬁcantly reduces the renal macrophage count [ 47 ] . The recruitment of monocytes is mainly controlled by chemokines such as MCP - 1 , also named C – C motif chemokine ligand 2 ( CCL2 ) , that binds to C – C chemokine receptor type 2 ( CCR2 ) on the surface of monocytes [ 67 ] . Indeed , MCP - 1 deletion [ 40 ] or blockade by administration of a CCL2 - antagonizing L - RNA aptamer [ 57 ] or of a CCR2 antagonist [ 41 ] decreases macrophage renal inﬁltration and consequently decreases kidney injury in STZ - treated mice or in db / db mice ( Table 1 ) . The synthesis of MCP - 1 is under the control of the nuclear factor kappa B ( NF kappa B ) , a transcription factor whose activity is stimulated by tubular reabsorption of excess ﬁltered albumin . NF kappa B controls MCP - 1 production in human tubular cells [ 68 ] and in the renal cells from uremic rats [ 69 ] . In addition , glycated albumin stimulates NF kappa B activity in mesangial cells [ 70 ] . In humans , urinary MCP - 1 is positively correlated with albuminuria levels [ 71 – 73 ] and hyperglycemia according to the level of glycated proteins [ 70 ] . Renal inﬁltration of monocytes also depends on the binding of monocytes to molecules from the extracellular matrix . The renal expression of osteopontin ( OPN ) , a phosphogly - coprotein adhesion molecule , is upregulated in DN in humans , in STZ - treated mice , in db / db mice [ 74 ] and in OLETF rats [ 75 ] . OPN binds to CD44 on monocytes and promotes monocyte invasion in the kidneys [ 76 ] . In STZ - treated hypertensive Ren - 2 rats , OPN is overexpressed in mesangial cells [ 77 ] , podocytes [ 78 ] , endothelial cells [ 79 ] and in tubular cells in association with extensive macrophage accumulation in the kidneys [ 80 , 81 ] . Further - more , OPN deletion in db / db mice , Akita mice or STZ - treated mice decreases the lesions of DN , indicating that OPN - dependent monocyte recruitment plays an important role in DN [ 82 ] . In vitro treatment of human proximal tubular cells by glucose enhances OPN ex - pression , an effect involving toll - like receptor - 4 ( TLR4 ) activation [ 83 ] , phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase - [ 84 ] and the beta isoform of protein kinase C [ 81 ] - dependent pathways . Fractalkine ( CX3CL1 ) also drives monocytes into the kidneys since CX3CL1 and its receptor ( CX3CR1 ) are overexpressed in the kidneys of STZ - treated rats , and some CX3CR1 + cells are monocytes / macrophages [ 85 ] . Presence of renal macrophages de - creases in Cx3cr1 − / − mice treated with STZ , indicating that their number depends on the CX3CL1 / CX3CR1 interaction [ 42 ] . In vitro experiments show that CX3CL1 originates from human mesangial cells exposed to AGE [ 86 ] . In addition to MCP - 1 and CX3CL1 , the importance of other chemokines or cytokines in the recruitment of monocytes , such as CXCL8 [ 43 ] and IL - 17A [ 44 , 45 ] , is becoming apparent . 3 . 2 . Macrophage Polarization and Plasticity in DN Once in tissues , inﬁltrating monocytes differentiate into macrophages according to microenvironmental signals and molecules [ 87 ] . Macrophage polarization can be induced in vitro by distinct stimuli and different functional phenotypes are identiﬁed based on the expression of several markers ( cytokines , growth factors , chemokine receptors and surface antigens ) [ 88 , 89 ] . Very schematically , two classes of macrophages are described in in vitro studies . Classically activated ( M1 ) macrophages result from the exposure of monocytes to TH1 cytokines , such as interferon - γ ( IFN γ ) , interleukin ( IL ) 1 β and tumor necrosis factor - α ( TNF - α ) or to lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) . M1 macrophages display a high capacity to present antigens and produce high levels of proinﬂammatory cytokines , such as IL - 1 β , IL - 6 , IL - 12 and TNF - α , but a low level of IL - 10 . Chronic M1 macrophage activation can , therefore , mediate ROS - induced tissue damage and impair wound healing . To protect Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6009 7 of 21 against such tissue damage , the inﬂammatory response is spatially and temporally counter - balanced by regulatory mechanisms driven by alternatively activated ( M2 ) macrophages . Indeed , macrophages are plastic cells because they can switch from an active M1 to M2 and vice versa upon speciﬁc signals . Alternatively activated ( M2 ) macrophages produce anti - inﬂammatory cytokines such as IL - 10 , growth factors and proﬁbrotic factors like trans - forming growth factor - β ( TGF - β ) involved in the wound healing and ﬁbrosis process . In humans , M2 macrophages express speciﬁc markers including CD163 , CD206 , CD200R , alternative macrophage activation - associated CC - chemokine 1 ( AMAC1 ) [ 90 ] and coagula - tion factor XIII A1 ( FXIIIA1 ) . In in vitro experiments , the M2 phenotype can be induced by several combinations of stimuli : TH2 cytokines IL - 4 or IL - 13 ( M2a ) , immune complexes in combination with IL - 1 β or LPS ( M2b ) , IL - 10 or glucocorticoids ( M2c ) or by costimulation with TLR ligands and A2 adenosine receptor agonists or by IL - 6 ( M2d ) [ 91 ] . M1 / M2 classiﬁcation of macrophages is a simplistic overview of macrophage polar - ization and functions and does not represent the macrophage phenotypes observed in vivo since the tissue microenvironment is more complex with the simultaneous presence of several stimuli . For instance , M2a , M2b , M2c and M2d are not described in DN , and for that reason , we use here the nomenclature of M1 and M2 macrophages without distinction between the different subsets of the M2 phenotype . The modulation of macrophage polarization toward the M2 phenotype is associated with a decrease in renal ﬁbrosis as illustrated by several experimental studies ( Table 1 ) . Indeed , transfusion of IL - 4 / IL - 13 - polarized M2 macrophages in STZ - treated mice protects against tubular atrophy and interstitial ﬁbrosis [ 49 ] . Conversely , deletion of cyclooxygenase - 2 in STZ - treated mice increases renal M1 macrophages and renal ﬁbrosis [ 51 ] . Cellular interactions between macrophages and mesenchymal stem cells increase the ratio of M2 / M1 macrophages in the kidneys from STZ - treated mice [ 38 ] . Several translational research projects are ongoing in humans to assess the efﬁcacy and safety of intraarterially delivered mesenchymal stem cells / stromal cells from the adipose tissue ( NCT03840343 ) or from the umbilical cord ( NCT04562025 , NCT04216849 ) in patients with DN . Low doses of IL - 17A reduce the renal macrophage count , IL - 6 and TNF - α proteins in urine from db / db mice [ 44 ] . Knockout of TLR - 2 represses the kidney expression of IL - 1 β , IL - 6 , MCP - 1 , which are M1 macrophage - produced cytokines , in the kidneys of STZ - treated mice [ 50 ] . Pentraxin 3 decreases the number of M1 macrophages in the kidneys from STZ - treated mice and promotes the switch toward M2 macrophages , as shown by the induction of arginase 1 and CD206 and by the reduction of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) and CD16 / 32 proteins [ 48 ] . Hemin , an inducer of the heme oxygenase system , selectively modulates macrophage polarization toward the anti - inﬂammatory M2 macrophages in the kidneys of ZDF rats or STZ - treated rats [ 56 , 61 ] . In all the aforementioned studies , experimentally induced diabetes is associated with proinﬂammatory M1 macrophage inﬁltration in the kidneys . The switch toward the M2 phenotype is associated with the resolution of inﬂammation and with reduced renal ﬁbrosis , lower albuminuria and / or better renal function . In humans , the lack of longitudinal studies in the same subjects limits our under - standing of macrophage plasticity in DN . In transversal studies , there is a predominance of the M2 phenotype in high pathological grades of DN but the severity of renal ﬁbrosis very likely correlates with the duration and / or with the severity of the proinﬂammatory phase , which occurred before and was not assessed in these studies . For instance , in an autopsy - based study , the grade of renal ﬁbrosis positively correlated with CD163 + M2 macrophages [ 26 ] and in a biopsy - based study , the renal M1 macrophage count positively correlated with low ﬁbrosis , whereas the renal M2 macrophage inﬁltration predominated in patients with high ﬁbrosis [ 25 ] .

Brief Description of the RAS in DN There is the systemic RAS , which regulates extracellular ﬂuid volume and arterial pressure . It contrasts with a local RAS , which is expressed at the tissue level where it warrants non - hemodynamic functions [ 92 ] . RAS is an enzymatic cascade ( Figure 1 ) . The ﬁrst and limiting step of the enzymatic cascade is the synthesis of angiotensin I ( Ang - I ) obtained by cutting off the N - terminal part of angiotensinogen ( Agt ) by renin . Renin is synthesized as an inactive proenzyme ( prorenin ) which becomes enzymatically active through either catalytic cutting off the N - terminal propeptide by a convertase , or by a conformational change after its binding to the renin / prorenin receptor ( PRR ) . Besides its enzymatic action , PRR may also trigger intracellular pathways [ 93 ] . Ang - I is a ten - amino acid protein that gives rise to several angiotensins . Angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) is a dicarboxypeptidase that deletes 2 amino acids at the C - terminal end of several angiotensins . From Ang - I , ACE generates an octopeptide , angiotensin II ( Ang - II ) . From angiotensin 1 , 9 ( Ang - ( 1 , 9 ) ) , ACE generates angiotensin 1 , 7 ( Ang - ( 1 , 7 ) ) . ACE type 2 ( ACE2 ) is a monocarboxypeptidase that removes one amino acid at the C - terminal part of Ang - I and Ang - II , generating Ang - ( 1 , 9 ) or Ang - ( 1 , 7 ) . Neprilysin ( NEP ) is a tricarboxypeptidase that deletes three amino acids at the C - terminal end of Ang - I and gives rise to Ang - ( 1 , 7 ) [ 94 ] . Ang - II can bind to two G - protein - coupled receptors , Ang - II receptor type 1 ( AT1R ) and Ang - II receptor type 2 ( AT2R ) . Ang - ( 1 , 7 ) acts on its Mas receptor ( MASR ) . Ang - II and Ang - ( 1 , 7 ) are the main hormones of the RAS . However , the role of other angiotensins is emerging and Ang - ( 1 , 9 ) also exerts direct biological effects in the cardiovascular system by binding to AT2R [ 95 ] . Activation of AT1R in the glomerular zone of the adrenal glands induces the synthesis of aldosterone , which acts via the mineralocorticoid receptor ( MR ) and may also act on the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) with a lower afﬁnity [ 96 ] . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 23 phase , which occurred before and was not assessed in these studies . For instance , in an autopsy - based study , the grade of renal fibrosis positively correlated with CD163 + M2 macrophages [ 26 ] and in a biopsy - based study , the renal M1 macrophage count positively correlated with low fibrosis , whereas the renal M2 macrophage infiltration predominated in patients with high fibrosis [ 25 ] . 4 . Regulation of Monocytes / Macrophages by the RAS in DN 4 . 1 . Brief Description of the RAS in DN There is the systemic RAS , which regulates extracellular fluid volume and arterial pressure . It contrasts with a local RAS , which is expressed at the tissue level where it war - rants non - hemodynamic functions [ 92 ] . RAS is an enzymatic cascade ( Figure 1 ) . The first and limiting step of the enzymatic cascade is the synthesis of angiotensin I ( Ang - I ) ob - tained by cutting off the N - terminal part of angiotensinogen ( Agt ) by renin . Renin is syn - thesized as an inactive proenzyme ( prorenin ) which becomes enzymatically active through either catalytic cutting off the N - terminal propeptide by a convertase , or by a conformational change after its binding to the renin / prorenin receptor ( PRR ) . Besides its enzymatic action , PRR may also trigger intracellular pathways [ 93 ] . Ang - I is a ten - amino acid protein that gives rise to several angiotensins . Angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) is a dicarboxypeptidase that deletes 2 amino acids at the C - terminal end of several angio - tensins . From Ang - I , ACE generates an octopeptide , angiotensin II ( Ang - II ) . From angio - tensin 1 , 9 ( Ang - ( 1 , 9 ) ) , ACE generates angiotensin 1 , 7 ( Ang - ( 1 , 7 ) ) . ACE type 2 ( ACE2 ) is a monocarboxypeptidase that removes one amino acid at the C - terminal part of Ang - I and Ang - II , generating Ang - ( 1 , 9 ) or Ang - ( 1 , 7 ) . Neprilysin ( NEP ) is a tricarboxypeptidase that deletes three amino acids at the C - terminal end of Ang - I and gives rise to Ang - ( 1 , 7 ) [ 94 ] . Ang - II can bind to two G - protein - coupled receptors , Ang - II receptor type 1 ( AT1R ) and Ang - II receptor type 2 ( AT2R ) . Ang - ( 1 , 7 ) acts on its Mas receptor ( MASR ) . Ang - II and Ang - ( 1 , 7 ) are the main hormones of the RAS . However , the role of other angiotensins is emerging and Ang - ( 1 , 9 ) also exerts direct biological effects in the cardiovascular system by binding to AT2R [ 95 ] . Activation of AT1R in the glomerular zone of the adrenal glands induces the synthesis of aldosterone , which acts via the mineralocorticoid receptor ( MR ) and may also act on the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) with a lower affinity [ 96 ] .

RAS can be interrupted at several levels ( Figure 1 ) . Aliskiren is a direct renin inhibitor which blocks the production of all angiotensins [ 97 ] . Angiotensin - converting enzyme Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6009 9 of 21 inhibitors ( ACEI ) repress most of the conversion of Ang - I into Ang - II and of Ang - ( 1 , 9 ) into Ang - ( 1 , 7 ) . Angiotensin receptor blockers ( ARB ) target AT1R [ 11 ] . Eplerenone , spironolac - tone [ 98 ] and ﬁnerenone [ 99 ] are MR antagonists ( MRA ) . Thiorphan belongs to inhibitors of NEP ( NEPI ) [ 100 ] . Finally , diminazene aceturate is an activator of ACE2 [ 100 ] . 4 . 2 . Local RAS in the Kidneys In the kidneys , all members of the RAS are present and regulate renal functions [ 92 ] . There is evidence that hyperglycemia favors the production of Ang - II from tubular and glomerular cells [ 101 ] . Globally , the Ang - II , ACE , AT1R , MR axis opposes the actions of the Ang - ( 1 , 7 ) , ACE2 , MASR , AT2R axis . Brieﬂy , the former axis induces matrix expansion , oxidative stress , vasoconstriction and inﬂammation , whereas the other axis has antiﬁbrotic , anti - inﬂammatory and vasodilatory effects . The systemic RAS is low in humans suffering from diabetes mellitus , whereas the RAS intrinsic to the kidneys is activated [ 102 ] . This paradox might be accounted for by the repression of systemic renin production from the juxtaglomerular apparatus following increased production of Ang - II in glomerular and tubular cells [ 101 , 103 ] . Actually , there is a 100 - fold higher level of Ang - II in the tubular ﬂuid and / or in renal homogenates of several animal models of diabetes than in blood [ 92 ] . The activation of the RAS intrinsic to the kidneys is highlighted by the fact that ACEI or ARB are important treatments for patients with DN . They lower hypertension or albuminuria [ 104 – 106 ] and , remarkably , improve the trajectory of the renal function [ 107 , 108 ] . Blockade of the terminal step of the deleterious axis of the RAS with ﬁnerenone ( MRA ) in addition to ACEI or ARB is even more efﬁcient to prevent the occurrence of a combined endpoint including the decline of the renal function and the occurrence of cardiovascu - lar events than ACEI or ARB alone in patients with DN [ 109 ] , whereas comprehensive blockade of the RAS cascade with aliskiren added to ACEI or ARB [ 110 ] or ACEI on top of ARB [ 111 ] does not improve these outcomes . 4 . 3 . Local Components of the RAS in Monocytes / Macrophages Monocytes / macrophages produce Ang - II through the ACE [ 112 ] and Ang - ( 1 , 7 ) from Ang - II via ACE2 [ 113 ] and express AT1R [ 114 ] , AT2R [ 115 ] , MASR [ 116 ] and the MR [ 117 ] . Furthermore , macrophages from ldlr − / − ( low - density lipoprotein receptor ) mice express Agt and renin in atherosclerotic lesions [ 118 ] and PRR was recently detected in human monocyte cell lines , circulating human monocytes and in macrophages inﬁltrating the kidneys [ 119 , 120 ] . Therefore , it is proposed that the RAS produced in an autocrine manner is essential for monocyte - to - macrophage differentiation and for macrophage functions . Moreover , AT1R regulates the differentiation of bone marrow - derived monocytes into dendritic cells [ 121 ] . In pathological conditions , the RAS - dependent differentiation of monocytes into macrophages is disturbed and the two RAS axes oppose their actions . TNF - α downreg - ulates the ACE in human peripheral blood monocytes , thus impairing Ang - II produc - tion [ 122 ] . AT1R induces oxidative stress in macrophages derived from the human mono - cytic leukemia cell line THP - 1 [ 114 ] , and in turn , AT1R expression increases in peritoneal macrophages exposed to oxidative stress [ 113 ] . In patients on maintenance hemodialysis , losartan ( ARB ) prevents the development of circulating proinﬂammatory monocytes [ 123 ] , suggesting that ARB could regulate the inﬂammatory status of monocytes in vivo before their recruitment into the inﬂamed tissues . In patients with atherosclerosis , AT1R favors macrophage inﬁltration in atherosclerotic lesions as shown by the inhibition of macrophage inﬁltration in carotid plaques from patients treated with candesartan ( ARB ) as compared to patients without candesartan [ 124 ] . In the murine macrophage Raw 264 . 7 cell line , Ang - II , irrespective of its receptor , induces the M1 phenotype as measured by the production of the high - mobility group box - 1 , a DNA damage reparatory protein associated with inﬂam - mation [ 125 ] . In the same cells , Ang - II promotes macrophage polarization toward the M1 phenotype , also through the connexin 43 / NF kappa B signaling [ 126 ] . In human primary macrophages , LPS treatment increases the AT1R expression and ARB blocks the secretion Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6009 10 of 21 of proinﬂammatory cytokines [ 124 ] . In atherosclerosis , the MR seems to promote the M1 macrophage phenotype [ 117 ] . MASR is expressed on different subsets of mouse primary macrophages without any difference in expression between unstimulated , LPS / IFN γ - , IL - 4 / IL - 13 - and IL - 4 - polarized macrophages [ 127 , 128 ] . MASR deﬁciency stimulates the expressions of M1 markers in LPS / IFN γ and inhibits the expression of M2 markers in IL - 4 / IL - 13 - treated macrophages . MASR stimulation by Ang - ( 1 , 7 ) decreases the expression of M1 markers in LPS - [ 129 ] or LPS / IFN γ - stimulated mouse peritoneal macrophages [ 128 ] . Moreover , Ang - ( 1 , 7 ) treatment increases mRNA expression of YM1 , an M2 marker , in mouse macrophages stimulated by IL - 4 [ 128 ] . The anti - inﬂammatory action of Ang - ( 1 , 7 ) depends on MASR stimulation through inhibition of the TLR4 - mediated JNK / FoxO1 signaling pathway in LPS - treated RAW macrophages [ 130 ] . MASR knockout increases in vitro migration and T cell activation capacities of peritoneal mouse macrophages [ 127 ] . ACE2 overexpression is associated with a signiﬁcant reduction of Ang - II - induced MCP - 1 in THP - 1 macrophages [ 131 ] . Interestingly , human peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to pharmacological doses of renin produce proinﬂammatory cytokines IL - 6 , TNF - α and IFN γ independently from the Ang - II – AT1R pathway [ 119 ] . Actually , besides its enzymatic role , PRR triggers macrophage inﬁltration in glomerulonephritis [ 132 ] and chronic kidney disease - associated heart failure [ 133 ] . More investigations are needed to explore the role of PRR in mono - cyte / macrophage recruitment and polarization in DN . Taken as a whole , the ACE , Ang - II , AT1R , MR axis intrinsic to monocytes / macrophages is stimulated in inﬂammatory conditions and promotes the pro - inﬂammatory M1 pheno - type , whereas the Ang - ( 1 , 7 ) , ACE2 , MASR axis potentiates the polarization of macrophages into an anti - inﬂammatory M2 subset . 4 . 4 . Modulation of Monocyte Recruitment by the RAS in DN The ACE , Ang - II , AT1R , MR axis enhances the adhesion of human peripheral mono - cytes to monolayers of human endothelial cells [ 134 ] . P - selectin , E - selectin , ICAM - 1 and VCAM - 1 expression increases in arterioles and venules of Ang - II - treated rats [ 135 ] as well as in aortas of Ang - II - infused rats [ 136 ] . Intraperitoneal injection of Ang - II in rats promotes the adhesion of mononuclear cells to arterioles depending on P - selectin and integrin beta 2 [ 135 ] . In vitro and in vivo experiments show that Ang - II promotes monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells and migration through ICAM - 1 [ 137 ] . Since some of these adhesion molecules are upregulated in DN [ 58 , 64 – 66 ] , renal production of Ang - II could stimulate their expression in renal endothelial cells to promote migration of monocytes into the kidneys . Highlighting the role of the RAS intrinsic to the kidneys for monocyte recruitment in DN ( Table 2 ) , activation of the ACE and AT1R promotes the accumulation of macrophages in the kidneys of STZ - treated mice through increased MCP - 1 expression and NF kappa B activity [ 138 , 139 ] . Renal subcapsular administration of valsartan ( ARB ) reduces the renal macrophage inﬁltration in STZ - treated mice [ 138 ] . In animal models of DN with hypertension , ACEI decrease the kidney macrophage count . Indeed , in STZ - treated Ren - 2 rats , perindopril ( ACEI ) reduces renal ﬁbrosis [ 33 ] and macrophage inﬁltration [ 140 ] depending on OPN [ 80 ] . The role of OPN is further documented in OLETF rats treated with ramipril ( ACEI ) [ 75 ] . Similar to the reno - protective effect of ramipril in human patients with DN [ 106 ] , captopril ( ACEI ) inhibits renal macrophage inﬁltration in the kidneys from STZ - treated hypertensive Nos3 − / − mice even when blood pressure values are controlled with a diuretic [ 52 ] . Further , captopril administration reduces both renal macrophage inﬁltration and renal ﬁbrosis in db / db mice [ 141 ] . Similarly , olmesartan ( ARB ) decreases interstitial ﬁbrosis and renal macrophage count in STZ - treated rats [ 142 ] . Reduction of interstitial ﬁbrosis and decreased expression of the TGF - β protein and of the NF kappa B activity in the kidneys from STZ - treated rats are obtained with telmisartan ( ARB ) associated with thiorphan ( NEPI ) or an ACE2 activator ( Dize ) [ 100 ] . More directly , cyclic ( c ) Ang - Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6009 11 of 21 ( 1 , 7 ) administration in ob / ob mice decreases the amount of interstitial and glomerular macrophages in the kidneys [ 143 ] . Table 2 .

Despite the presence of the MR on macrophages [ 117 ] , its role regarding renal macro - phage inﬁltration or polarization in animal models of DN is not yet documented . However , a 12 - week treatment of enalapril ( ACEI ) in STZ - treated mice or db / db mice does not reduce the expression of the CD11c marker of M1 macrophages in the kidneys . Indeed , CD11c Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6009 12 of 21 positivity is even higher in enalapril - treated mice than in their untreated counterparts [ 144 ] . With regard to intrarenal overproduction of aldosterone in the urine , which is not lowered by enalapril in db / db mice [ 146 ] , this paradoxical phenomenon may be due to the stimula - tion of the MR on macrophages . In line with this interpretation , albuminuria is suppressed at week 6 and not any longer at week 12 [ 144 ] , suggesting that aldosterone might increase albuminuria [ 147 ] despite ACE inhibition . Together , these studies demonstrate that beneﬁcial effects of ACEI or ARB ( and maybe of MRA ) on renal function , albuminuria and ﬁbrosis are associated with a decreased macrophage count intrinsic to the kidneys ( Figure 2 ) . The role of stimulation of the Ang - ( 1 , 7 ) , ACE2 , MASR axis regarding renal macrophage inﬁltration remains to be elucidated in DN . Int . J . Mol .

Modulation of Macrophage Polarization by the RAS in DN The RAS - dependent regulation of macrophage polarization in diabetic kidneys is scarcely documented , but this research ﬁeld could be more widely studied thanks to technical advances . Indeed , reliable and highly efﬁcient isolation of immune cells from the Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 6009 13 of 21 kidneys has emerged thanks to the development of mechanical tissue disruptors without the collagenase digestion step [ 148 ] . Vitamin D treatment , which inhibits the Ang - II , ACE , AT1R , MR axis of the RAS , decreases the number of M1 macrophages , increases the number of M2 macrophages and reduces albuminuria in STZ - treated rats [ 54 ] . Losartan induces a phenotype switch in the inﬁltrated renal macrophages in obese mice following a high - fat diet by increasing M2 markers and decreasing M1 markers [ 149 ] . In apolipoprotein E - deﬁcient mice with renal failure induced by the removal of one entire kidney , the administration of bone marrow cells from At1r − / − mice increases the M2 macrophage count in the remaining kidney [ 150 ] . Captopril administration in hypertensive eNos − / − db / db mice enhances the expression of M2 markers in the kidneys [ 141 ] . Together , these studies suggest that suppression of the Ang - II , ACE , AT1R , MR axis may switch the renal macrophage phenotype from M1 to M2 and contribute to protecting the kidneys from diabetes - related injuries ( Figure 2 ) . Some data suggest that telmisartan ( ARB ) could modulate the macrophage phenotype . Indeed , telmisartan represses MCP - 1 expression from peripheral monocytes in patients with essential hypertension [ 151 ] and drives monocytes to M2 macrophage polarization in mice following stimulation of peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma ( PPAR - γ ) [ 152 ] . Therefore , telmisartan could promote the differentiation of peripheral monocytes toward the M2 macrophage phenotype in patients with DN . To test this hypothesis , a pilot prospective and randomized study was performed at our hospital ( NCT02768948 ) . One hundred ﬁfty - four patients with T2D were screened and 24 patients were included with a DN characterized by a GFR > 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m 2 , micro - or macroalbuminuria without nephrotic proteinuria and hypertension treated with ACEI or ARB . The patients were assigned 80 mg telmisartan or 100 mg losartan daily , as already done in the AMADEO study [ 153 ] , and they were randomized in order to prevent the confounding effects of various levels of albuminuria on the renal production of MCP - 1 since telmisartan is more efﬁcient than losartan in reducing albuminuria [ 153 ] . The primary goal was to compare the in vitro polarization potential of circulating monocytes from patients treated with losartan or telmisartan . After six months of treatment , peripheral blood mononuclear cells from these patients were collected to isolate monocytes that were in vitro differentiated into resting macrophages ( RM , used as control ) , M1 macrophages ( in the presence of IL - 1 β ) or M2 macrophages ( in the presence of IL - 4 ) . The secondary objective was to compare the variation of urinary MCP - 1 over the creatinine ratio between the losartan and telmisartan groups . Four patients were lost to follow - up , three more patients were not compliant with the study and one was excluded following a rapid decline of the GFR . The data from 16 patients were analyzed : eight patients were treated with losartan and eight patients were treated with telmisartan . The mean age was 68 ± 7 years , the mean GFR was 54 ± 17 mL / min / 1 . 73 m 2 , the body mass index was 29 ± 5 kg / m 2 , the UACR was 342 ± 540 mg / g and HbA1c was 7 . 3 ± 1 . 4 % . There was no difference in urinary excretion of MCP - 1 between the two groups . The fold changes of mRNA expression of M2 or M1 markers ( compared to the respective RM ) were similar in the two groups ( Figure 3A ) . For each patient , the M2 / M1 score was also calculated , corresponding to the ratio of the number of M2 markers to the number of M1 markers that were overexpressed in response to IL - 4 or IL - 1 β , respectively . A score greater than 1 means that macrophages from the patient respond better to stimulation with IL - 4 than with IL - 1 β . Macrophages from 13 patients ( six patients with losartan and seven patients with telmisartan ) had a score over 1 without differences with respect to losartan and telmisartan administration ( Figure 3B ) . In other words , polarization of macrophages from patients treated with losartan or telmisartan was altered . This speciﬁcity of macrophage polarization could depend on DN as well as on the effect of ARB . These results also suggest that ARB therapy could condition macrophages to be less receptive to a deleterious proinﬂammatory renal environment while retaining their potential to differentiate into the renoprotective M2 phenotype .

Consequently , they both offer therapeutic targets to preserve the re - nal function in patients with DN . Osteopontin , MCP - 1 and their respective receptors on monocytes , CD44 and CCR2 , are intermediate links between the RAS pathways and mono - cytes / macrophages . Targeting these molecules in experimental DN limits the recruitment of monocytes into the kidneys and protects the kidneys from diabetes - induced injuries . Some clinical trials targeting leukocyte recruitment with MCP - 1 or CCR2 inhibitors or anti - inflammatory molecules are in progress in patients with DN treated with RAS blockers [ 154 ] . Suppressing the ACE , Ang - II , AT1R , MR axis of the RAS is the classical treatment of DN , which acts partly by blocking the recruitment of monocytes into the kidneys and by increasing the M2 / M1 polarization ratio in kidney - resident macrophages . As M2 macrophages have a kidney - protective role in DN , more experimental work is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of the modulation of the macrophage phenotype by the RAS in DN . In particular , the effects of the activation of the Ang - ( 1 , 7 ) , ACE2 , AT2R , MASR axis and the effect of PRR or MR blockade on macrophage polarization have to be investigated in the context of DN . Data from such studies could open new therapeutic avenues to prevent the evolution of DN towards end - stage renal disease . Author Contributions : C .
