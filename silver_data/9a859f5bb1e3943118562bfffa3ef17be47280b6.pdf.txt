Dynamins 1 , 2 , and 3 contain a pleckstrin homol - ogy ( PH ) domain that binds phosphoinositides with a very low afﬁnity ( K D > 1 mM ) , and this interaction appears to be crucial for function . These observations prompted the suggestion that an array of PH domains drives multivalent binding of dynamin oli - gomers to phosphoinositide - containing membranes . Although in vitro experiments reported here are consistent with this hypoth - esis , we ﬁnd that PH domain mutations that abolish dynamin function do not alter localization of the protein in transfected cells , indicatingthatthePHdomaindoesnotplayasimpletargetingrole . An alternative possibility is suggested by the geometry of dynamin helices resolved by electron microscopy . Even with one phospha - tidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate [ PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] molecule bound per PH domain , these dynamin assemblies will elevate the concentra - tion of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at coated pit necks , and effectively cluster ( or sequester ) this phosphoinositide . In vitro ﬂuorescence quenching studies using labeled phosphoinositides are consistent with dy - namin - induced PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clustering . We therefore propose that the ability of dynamin to alter the local distribution of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 could be crucial for the role of this GTPase in promoting membrane scission during clathrin - mediated endocytosis . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clus - tering could promote vesicle scission through direct effects on membrane properties , or might play a role in dynamin’s ability to regulate actin polymerization . endocytosis (cid:1) phosphoinositide (cid:1) vesicle (cid:1) GTPase (cid:1) actin L arge GTPases in the dynamin family are involved in many cellular trafficking , signaling , and morphological processes ( 1 ) . The dynamins themselves have been most well - studied in clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( 1 – 4 ) , where they play important roles in both coated pit invagination and scission of endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane . All dynamin family mem - bers contain a GTPase domain , a ‘‘middle’’ domain and a GTPase effector ( or GED ) domain . They self - assemble into ring - like and tubular structures in a manner regulated by GTP binding and hydrolysis . Dynamins 1 , 2 , and 3 also contain a pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain that binds phosphoinositides such as phosphatidylinositol - ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate [ PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] with low affinity ( 5 ) , plus a C - terminal proline / arginine rich domain ( PRD ) that is important for targeting to coated pits ( 1 – 3 ) ( see Fig . S1 A ) . Mutations in the dynamin GTPase or PH domains that impair dynamin function cause the overexpressed protein to act as a dominant inhibitor of clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( 6 – 10 ) . Because some PH domains target their host proteins to phosphoinositide - containing membranes ( 11 ) , we were inter - ested in how ( or whether ) PH domain / phosphoinositide inter - actions promote dynamin recruitment to coated pit necks . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is important for early and late stages of clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( 12 , 13 ) , and its acute depletion causes rapid dissociation of endocytic proteins such as clathrin and dynamin from the plasma membrane ( 14 ) . Although the isolated PH domain from dynamin - 1 or dynamin - 2 binds PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 very weakly , with K D values of 1 – 4 mM ( 5 , 15 ) , dynamin oligomerization ( 2 ) allows high - avidity multivalent PH domain - mediated interaction with membranes ( 11 ) . This can be reca - pitulated with engineered PH domain oligomers ( 15 ) . When a dynamin variant with a defective PH domain is overexpressed in cells , its co - oligomerization with endogenous WT dynamin is expected to impair multivalent targeting to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing membranes—effectively ‘‘poisoning’’ the avidity ef - fect mentioned above . We show here that such dominant inhi - bition of dynamin binding to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing membranes can be reproduced in vitro . However , we could detect no influence of PH domain mutations on dynamin localization in cellular studies , raising the possibility that the PH domain does not contribute to dynamin targeting in vivo . Structures of dynamin helices thought to resemble those at coated pit necks ( 16 , 17 ) suggest instead that an array of PH domains might laterally recruit PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to the site of dynamin assembly at the membrane . Thus , instead of recruiting its host protein to phosphoinositide - containing membranes , the dynamin PH domain could play the converse role : recruiting phosphoinositides to dynamin assemblies . Dynamin could thus direct local elevation of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density ( or ‘‘clustering’’ ) , which might be important for membrane scission ( 18 ) and / or the crucial ( 19 – 21 ) coordination of clathrin - mediated endocytosis with actin filament nucleation and polymerization ( 22 ) . Results and Discussion PH Domain - Mediated PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 Binding in Vitro . We first tested the hypothesis that PH * dynamin ( Fig . S1 A ) , which has muta - tions in the PH domain (cid:1) 6 / (cid:1) 7 loop that impair phosphoinositide binding ( 15 ) , can dominantly inhibit in vitro binding of WT dynamin to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing membranes . Surface plas - mon resonance ( SPR ) studies show that PH * dynamin binds very weakly to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Fig . 1 A ) , whereas WT dynamin binds membranes containing 10 % ( mole / mole ) PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 with an apparent K D of 205 (cid:1) 126 nM ( Fig . 1 A ) . For comparison , K D values for PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding by PH domain monomers and dimers are in the 1 mM and 10 (cid:2) M ranges respectively ( 15 ) .

S1 B ) and binds PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 with greatly reduced affinity ( Fig . 1 A ) . Thus , both a WT PH domain and oligomerization are required for high - affinity phosphoinositide binding by dynamin . When PH * dynamin was added to a fixed concentration ( 400 nM ) of WT protein , the total SPR binding signal fell dramatically ( Fig . 1 B ) . Thus , PH * dynamin exerts a potent dominant - negative effect on in vitro binding of WT dynamin to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing membranes . Adding just one PH * dynamin molecule per WT tetramer ( to give a PH * : WT ratio of 0 . 25 ) was sufficient to reduce the binding signal 3 - fold . By contrast , adding oligomer - ization - defective PH * (cid:2) cc 1 had only a small effect ( Fig . 1 B ) . These in vitro data argue that the dominant - negative effect of PH * dynamin overexpression in cells ( 8 – 10 ) could reflect im - paired membrane - binding of tetramers ( or higher oligomers ) that incorporate PH * dynamin ( Fig . 1 C ) . Subcellular Localization of Dynamin Is Unaffected by PH Domain Mutation . If PH * dynamin exerts its dominant - negative effect in cells by interfering with membrane targeting of endogenous WT protein , this should be reflected in its subcellular localization . We took advantage of a specific GTPase - defective ( T65A ) dynamin variant to investigate this . Over - expressing dynamin with a T65A ( or T65F ) mutation leads to the accumulation of coated pits with elongated necks ( 24 , 25 ) . T65A dynamin accu - mulates in electron - dense tubules at these elongated necks , apparently trapped in a prescission step because it cannot hydrolyze GTP ( 25 ) . If multivalent PH domain - mediated bind - ing to membrane PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is required for targeting dynamin to coated pit necks , a T65A variant that also contains the PH * mutation should fail to accumulate at this location . However , Fig . 2 shows that this is not the case . HA - tagged T65A dynamin colocalizes with GFP - clathrin at the periphery of tTA - HeLa cells ( Fig . 2 A – C ) , consistent with previous studies ( 25 ) . Removing the PRD from T65A dynamin ( by deleting residues 751 – 851 ) abolishes colocalization with GFP - clathrin ( Fig . 2 D – F ) , and tubular structures form in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 2 E ) . This reflects the importance of the PRD for targeting dynamin to endocytic structures ( 2 ) . By contrast , mutating the PH domain ( in PH * / T65A dynamin ) has no effect on colocalization of T65A dynamin with clathrin at the cell periphery ( Fig . 2 G – I ) . These epifluorescence studies show that PH * / T65A dynamin is targeted to endocytic structures despite its very low affinity for PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , and does not differ from a T65A variant with a WT PH domain .

Fig . 3 compares epifluorescence and TIRF images for each HA - tagged dynamin variant . A significant amount of WT and T65A dy - namin is found within the TIRF zone ( i . e . , within (cid:3) 100 – 150 nm of the cell surface ) , and mutating the PH domain ( in PH * and PH * / T65A ) has little effect on the proportion of fluorescent label excited by the evanescent wave . By contrast , PRD deletion significantly reduces the amount of WT or T65A dynamin within the TIRF zone . These data argue that eliminating the ability of the dynamin PH domain to bind phosphoinositides ( in PH * dynamin ) does not impair its targeting to endocytic sites . Al - though it is possible that PH * / T65A dynamin fails to form WT - like helices , the TIRF studies indicate that it is likely to be at the coated pit neck . An Effector Role for the Dynamin PH Domain ? The cellular results above suggest that the dynamin PH domain does not simply target the protein . Because it is clearly essential for function , might the PH domain instead play an effector role ? As shown in Fig . 4 and Fig . S2 , the dominant - negative effect of PH * dynamin on clathrin - mediated endocytosis in HeLa cells resembles that of the GTPase - defective T65A or K44A mutants ( 6 , 7 , 24 , 25 ) , whereas (cid:2) PRD dynamin ( targeting - defective ) has no such in - fluence ( 7 ) . Moreover , the dominant - negative effect of T65A , K44A , and PH * dynamin variants is lost when the PRD is removed ( Fig . 4 and Fig . S2 ) , arguing that normal targeting is required for inhibition . By contrast , introducing the PH * muta - tion into T65A or K44A dynamin does not block dominant - negative activity , suggesting that the PH domain is not required for their targeting . Thus , in this analysis the PH * mutation has more in common with T65A and K44A ( GTPase ) mutations than with PRD deletion—consistent with an effector role for the PH domain . EM studies of negatively stained samples also support this suggestion . PH * dynamin retains its ability to form 50 - nm - diameter tubes when incubated with phosphatidylserine ( PS ) - containing liposomes ( Fig . S3 ) . These tubes were indistinguish - able ( Fig . S3 D – G ) from those seen for WT dynamin ( 27 , 28 ) , and underwent a similar constriction ( 28 ) upon GTP addition ( Fig . S3 H and I ) . Although PH * dynamin has reduced affinity for PS - containing liposomes ( Fig . S3 A ) , it is clearly capable of forming the same tubular structures as WT dynamin , consistent with the unchanged subcellular localization of PH * / T65A dy - namin in our immunofluorescence studies . It is true that PH domain mutations might impair the kinetics of dynamin assem - bly and / or constriction at clathrin - coated pits . However , it seems equally likely that that the PH domain plays a direct part in executing dynamin action at the necks of coated pits . Geometric Arguments Suggest that Dynamin Clusters PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . If interactions between the PH domain and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 do not drive targeting of dynamin to coated pit necks ( and its assembly ) , what might their role be ? One possibility is that dynamin modifies phosphoinositide distribution ( rather than being re - cruited by phosphoinositides ) . For example , recruitment / sequestration of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( leading to its clustering ) might be important for coordinating dynamin activity with actin polymer - ization ( 19 , 20 ) . Insight into this possibility comes from cryo - EM - based structural models of dynamin assemblies bound to lipid tubules ( 16 , 17 , 29 ) . When treated with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue GMP - PCP , (cid:2) PRD dynamin forms well - ordered ( constricted ) 40 - nm - diameter helices ( Fig . 5 A ) with 26 dynamins per turn around a PS tubule ( 17 ) . Docking structures of dy - namin’s constituent domains into the EM reconstruction indi - cated that the PH domain ( yellow in Fig . 5 A ) abuts the ( gray ) PS tubule ( 16 ) . The largest tubule that can be enclosed by the dynamin helix has a diameter of (cid:3) 130Å . One turn of the helix ( 26 molecules ) extends 94Å along the helical axis , giving a lipid - contact area of 38 , 390 Å 2 per turn , or 1 , 476 Å 2 per dynamin molecule—approximately the surface area of the PH domain lipid - binding face ( 11 ) . If each PH domain binds just one PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 molecule , a membrane tubule surrounded by a constricted dynamin helix will contain one PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 mole - cule per 1 , 476 Å 2 . This corresponds to a PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density of 4 . 8 % ( mole / mole ) – assuming a mean membrane surface area per lipid molecule of (cid:3) 70 Å 2 [ and 90 Å 2 for PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] . This significantly exceeds estimates of (cid:3) 1 % ( mole / mole ) for plasma membrane PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density ( 30 ) . Thus , dynamin ( once constricted ) can elevate local PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentration by up to (cid:3) 5 - fold even if each PH domain binds just one PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 molecule . Nonconstricted dynamin helices seen without added GTP ( 17 , 29 ) have a luminal diameter of (cid:3) 210 Å , and pitch of 106 Å ( with 28 dynamins per helical turn ) , which would stabilize a local PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density of (cid:3) 2 . 8 % ( mole / mole ) using the same assumptions . The fact that dynamin’s membrane - binding affinity increases in vitro as PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density is elevated ( 31 ) also argues that dynamin assembly on membrane tubules must stabilize local increases in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density . Constriction of dynamin helices upon GTP hydrolysis would further increase PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density , and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 densities would be significantly higher than these values if each PH domain binds multiple PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 molecules . Like many PH domains ( 11 ) , the PH domain of dynamin has clear electrostatic sidedness ( Fig . 5 B ) , and the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding site lies on the positively charged face ( 5 ) . If this face lines the inner surface of dynamin helices as suggested ( 17 ) , dynamin will form a ‘sheath’ of positive charge around the TIRF T65A WT PH * / T65A PH * Epi ∆ PRD / T65A ∆ PRD Fig . 3 .

Regions of positive electrostatic potential adjacent to membrane surfaces sequester PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 32 ) , as has been well - studied for the unstructured basic cluster in MARCKS ( myristoylated alanine - rich C kinase substrate ) , for example ( 33 ) . Related proteins have been named pipmodulins ( 34 ) because they are thought to control levels of free PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the plasma membrane through electrostatic sequestration . Self - Quenching of Fluorescent PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 upon Dynamin Binding . To test the hypothesis that dynamin clusters PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , we analyzed its ability to promote self - quenching of fluorescently labeled PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 incorporated into vesicles at a low spatial density . This approach was previously used to study PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 sequestration by the MARCKS ( 151 – 175 ) peptide ( 33 ) , myelin basic protein ( 35 ) , and NAP - 22 ( 36 ) . We used PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 labeled in the sn - 1 position with the 26 - carbon BODIPY - TMR label attached via a 6 - carbon linker . Either caproic ( C6 ) or palmitic acid ( C16 ) was esterified to the sn - 2 position . Although the volume of the acyl - chain region of C6 - BODIPY - TMR - PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 most closely resembles that of natural PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , similar results were obtained with both forms . As shown in Fig . 5 C , adding 0 . 5 (cid:2) M dynamin to 0 . 1 - (cid:2) m vesicles containing 1 % ( mole / mole ) C6 - BODIPY - TMR - PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in a DOPC background caused significant fluo - rescence quenching , to a maximum of 40 (cid:1) 3 % ( Fig . 5 D ) . A similar effect was seen with 0 . 5 (cid:2) M MARCKS ( 151 – 175 ) peptide ( 33 ) , whereas PH * dynamin caused no quenching . At 1 % ( mole / mole ) , the mean distance between PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 mole - cules is (cid:3) 100 Å . Because this exceeds R o for the BODIPY label ( (cid:3) 50 Å ) , no self - quenching is expected under these conditions . The mean distance between PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 molecules falls below 50 Å if local density exceeds 2 . 8 % ( mole / mole ) . Thus , the observed dynamin - induced quenching of BODIPY - TMR fluo - rescence is consistent with the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 densities likely to be stabilized by dynamin binding / assembly . Although these data support PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 quenching by dynamin , there are two important caveats . First , the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - specific PH domain from phospholipase C - (cid:3) 1 also quenched BODIPY - TMR fluorescence ( Fig . S4 A ) . This PH domain binds PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in a well - characterized 1 : 1 interac - tion ( 11 ) , and is thought not to cluster phosphoinositides ( 33 ) . Quenching in this case could reflect PH domain oligomerization on the membrane surface . Alternatively , this PH domain might bind actually bind multiple PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 molecules . Indeed , binding of multiple PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 molecules to a single PH domain would also explain why a dimeric form of the isolated dynamin PH domain ( 15 ) quenches BODIPY - TMR - PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 fluorescence ( Fig . S4 B ) . However , we cannot currently exclude an alternative explanation : that that the ob - served fluorescence quenching actually reflects changes in fluor environment arising from binding - induced alterations in mem - brane structure . One control to test this hypothesis used BODIPY - TMR labeled phosphatidylinositol ( PtdIns ) at 1 % ( mole / mole ) in DOPC membranes also containing 1 % ( mole / mole ) unlabeled PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Surprisingly , both WT dynamin and the MARCKS peptide promoted significant ( but reduced ) quenching of the labeled PtdIns ( Fig . S4 C ) , which is difficult to ascribe straightforwardly [ in the presence of unlabeled PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] to phosphoinositide clustering . We have worked extensively to study PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clustering by dynamin and MARCKS ( 151 – 175 ) more directly with 2 - color FRET approaches , but without success . However , several ap - proaches , including EPR ( 37 ) , FCS ( 38 ) , phospholipase - C ac - cessibility ( 33 ) , and fluorescence self - quenching studies ( 33 ) all argue that the MARCKS ( 151 – 175 ) peptide clusters PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . In our studies using BODIPY - TMR - labeled PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , dynamin promotes a degree of self - quenching that is equal or greater than that seen with the MARCKS peptide . Thus , within the limitations of current technology our data indicate that dynamin may induce PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clustering . Possible Implications of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 Clustering by Dynamin . If dy - namin clusters PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , what might be the functional significance ? Elevated PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels are well known to activate actin assembly , and could contribute to dynamin’s role in regulating actin assembly during clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis ( 19 , 20 , 39 ) . Local increases in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels can arise when synthe - sis of this phosphoinositide is increased ( and / or degradation is reduced ) or from sequestration of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 by proteins such 550 560 570 580 590 600 1 . 0x10 6 2 . 0x10 6 3 . 0x10 6 No protein WT dynamin PH * dynamin MARCKS ( 151 - 175 ) Wavelength ( nm ) F l uo r esce n ce U n i t s 0 200 400 600 800 1000 0 10 20 30 40 WT dynamin PH * dynamin MARCKS ( 151 - 175 ) [ Protein ] ( nM ) Q u e n c h i ng ( % ) A C D 40nm 26 dynamins per turn B membrane ( PS ) PH domain Fig . 5 .

PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 activates WASP family proteins either indirectly ( through effects on Cdc42 activation ) or directly , and a polybasic PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding region in N - WASP has been suggested to function as a ‘sensor’ of local PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density ( 40 ) . SNX9 may have similar capability ( 41 ) . One speculative possibility is that dynamin helices constrict and rapidly disassemble after GTP hydrolysis , and transiently expose a region in the coated pit neck with elevated PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density . This could promote initiation of actin polymerization by the actin - regulatory complexes known to be preassembled in this region ( 19 ) through association with dynamin . Indeed , time - lapse TIRF microscopy of live cells ( 39 ) indicates that actin recruitment to coated pit necks follows disassembly of dynamin helices . Actin polymerization may provide force for movement of the coated pit or vesicle into the cytosol ( 21 , 39 ) , with dynamin coordinating this process both through influences on actin regulatory proteins and on local PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentration mediated by its PH domain . Alternatively , without disassembly , the ability of constricted dynamin helices to concentrate PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 could contribute to an effective phase separation of lipids within the coated pit neck – together with BAR domain - containing proteins such as amphiphysins and endophilins ( 42 ) . It was proposed that the line tension at the interface between such a lipid phase within the coated pit neck and the adjacent bulk lipid facilitates membrane fusion ( and thus fission of the membrane tubule ) , so that the coated vesicle is ‘‘pinched off’’ ( 18 ) . Indeed , Roux et al . ( 43 ) proposed that proteins involved in endocytosis—including dy - namin—might function to change the local lipid composition , triggering phase separation and fission of membrane tubules . In vitro studies of dynamin - coated PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing lipid tubules have shown that constriction after GTP hydrolysis is not sufficient for their fission unless longitudinal tension is applied ( 44 ) . In cells , this tension might be provided by actin polymer - ization , possibly promoting fission of the coated pit neck at a lipid phase boundary induced by dynamin - mediated PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clustering . Conclusions The data presented here suggest that the PH domain of dynamin plays a functional role that is distinct from targeting the protein to phosphoinositide - containing membranes . Al - though a PH domain mutation ( PH * ) impairs PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding by dynamin in vitro , it does not alter subcellular localization of dynamin expressed in HeLa cells—despite abolishing function . If dynamin is targeted to the necks of coated pits through other interactions ( such as those mediated by its PRD ) , it has the capacity to cluster PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at this location . Significant PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clustering is predicted from simple considerations of EM - based structures of dynamin assemblies , and we present fluorescence quenching data that are consistent with this possibility . We therefore hypothesize that PH domain of dynamin plays a direct part in executing dynamin action on the membrane at the coated pit neck . Clustering of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 by dynamin could contribute di - rectly to a lipid phase separation proposed to facilitate mem - brane scission ( 18 ) . Alternatively ( or in addition ) , dynamin may regulate actin polymerization through alterations in local PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density . Many PH domains with low affinities for phosphoinositides are found in proteins capable of self - assembly , and it is possible that many of these will function as pipmodulins as suggested here for dynamin . Materials and Methods Constructs and Cell Culture . Mammalian expression constructs for HA - tagged human WT or K44A dynamin - 1 in the tet - regulatable vector pUHD10 . 3 were a gift from Dr . Sandra Schmid . Mutagenesis and cell manipulations were as described in ref . 9 . For Sf9 cell expression , dynamin - 1 cDNA was subcloned— with an N - terminal hexahistidine tag—into pFastBac - 1 ( Invitrogen ) , using Eco RI / Hin dIII sites . ProteinProductionandPurification .

Dynamin was puriﬁed by metal - afﬁnity chromatography , fol - lowed by anion - exchange and gel - ﬁltration in 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 2 , 250 mM NaCl , and 2 mM DTT . PH domains were puriﬁed as described in ref . 15 . Antibodies . HA - tagged dynamin was detected with mouse monoclonal an - ti - HA ( Covance ) , used at 1 / 1 , 000 dilution . Secondary antibodies were FITC - or TexasRed - conjugatedIgG 1 ( SantaCruzBiotechnology ) atadilutionof1 / 40 , or ( for TIRF experiments ) Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated IgG 1 ( Molecular Probes / Invitrogen ) at a 1 / 40 dilution . Immunofluorescence Microscopy . HeLa ( or tTA - HeLa ) cells were seeded onto glass coverslips ( Fisher ) 24 h before transfection . For transferrin uptake and TIRF experiments , cells were cotransfected ( using Lipofectamine 2000 ) with the appropriate dynamin constructs ( in pUHD10 . 3 ) and pUHD15 – 1 ( which directs tTA expression ) . For clathrin colocalization experiments , tTA - HeLa ( Tet - Off ) cells were cotransfected with GFP - clathrin ( 45 ) and the noted dy - namin construct ( in pUHD10 . 3 ) . Dynamin expression was limited by including 100 ng / mL tetracycline in the medium . After 36 h , cells were washed with PBS and formaldehyde - ﬁxed / permeabilized for immunoﬂuorescence using stan - dard procedures . Coverslips were mounted onto slides with Fluoromount G ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) . For epiﬂuorescence studies , digital images were acquired using a Hamamatsu Orca CCD camera on a Leica DM IRBE microscope . Serial Z sections were imaged and deconvoluted using OpenLab ( Improvision ) software . For TIRF microscopy , coverslips were mounted in PBS containing Mg 2 (cid:6) and Ca 2 (cid:6) and sealed with clear nail polish .
