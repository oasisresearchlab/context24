COVID - 19 clusters in schools : frequency , size , and transmission rates from crowdsourced exposure reports Paul Tupper 1 ∗ , Shraddha Pai 2 , 3 , COVID Schools Canada 4 , Caroline Colijn 1 1 Department of Mathematics , Simon Fraser University , Burnaby , Canada 2 The Donnelly Centre , University of Toronto , Toronto , Canada 3 Ontario Institute for Cancer Research , Toronto , Canada 4 https : / / covidschoolscanada . org / ∗ To whom correspondence should be addressed ; E - mail : pft3 @ sfu . ca . The role of schools in the spread of the COVID - 19 pandemic is controversial , with some claiming they are an important driver of the pandemic and others arguing that transmission in schools is negligible . School cluster reports that have been collected in various jurisdictions are a source of data about transmission in schools . These reports consist of the name of a school , a date , and the number of students known to be in - fected . We provide a simple model for the frequency and size of clusters in this data , based on random arrivals of index cases at schools who then infect their classmates with a highly variable rate , ﬁtting the overdispersion evident in the data . We ﬁt our model to reports for several jurisdictions in the US and Canada , providing estimates of mean and dispersion for cluster size , whilst factoring in imperfect ascertainment . Our parameter estimates are robust to variations in ascertainment fraction . We use these estimates in three ways : i ) to explore how uneven the distribution of cases is among dif - ferent clusters in different jurisdictions ( that is , what fraction of cases are in the 20 % largest clusters ) , ii ) to estimate how long it will be until we see a cluster a given size in jurisdiction , and iii ) to determine the distribution of instantaneous transmission rate β among different index case . We show how these latter distribution can be used in sim - ulations of school transmission where we explore the effect of different interventions , in the context of highly variable transmission rates . 1 .

In most jurisdictions rates of COVID infection among children are similar to those in the adult population ( 8 ) . But severity is much lower in children ; the infection fatality rate ( IFR ) of COVID for at age 10 is estimated to be 0 . 002 % versus an IFR of 0 . 01 % at age 25 , and 0 . 4 % at age 55 ( 24 ) . Cases are more often asymptomatic among children , less likely to require hospitalization and ICU care ( 8 ) , and less likely to be classiﬁed as long COVID ( 34 ) . On the other hand , not all the news is good for children , MIS - C is a serious condition sometimes resulting from COVID infection ( 6 ) , and myocarditis happens more frequently as a side effect of infection among younger individuals ( 31 ) . Jurisdictions have had to make a choice between closing schools , with all the attendant social , eco - nomic , and psychological costs ( 9 ) , and leaving schools open , allowing possible transmission of COVID in that setting ( 8 ) . The direct downside of transmission in schools if it occurs is that children may be infected there , risking the low but non - negligible harms of COVID - 19 in that age range , but also adult teachers and staff are put at risk . Transmission in schools may also contribute to overall community transmission , indirectly jeopardizing more vulnerable individuals ( 41 ) . As a concrete example , if a child contracts COVID at school , they may then go on to transmit it to an elderly relative they live with , for whom the consequences are more severe ( 21 ) . Estimating the magnitude of these two kinds of harm and making the decision as to what choice to make involves many sources of uncertainty and value judgements , which helps explain why different jurisdictions have taken different approaches ( 18 ) . In some jurisdictions schools were open for the 2020 to 2021 school year , though many measures were put into place in order to reduce the risk of COVID transmission ( 28 ) . Measures include cohorting , stag - gered entrance and exit times , masks , improvements in ventilation , extra sanitization measures . In other jurisdictions schools were closed for large portions of the year ( 30 ) . Studies that have looked at the effect of school closures on the overall rate of COVID transmission ﬁnd mixed results : some ﬁnd substantial reduction in community transmission when schools are closed , and others small or no effect ( 11 , 41 ) . Given that schools involve many children all sharing a room for many hours a day , it may be surprising that there is not a clearer evidence of signiﬁcant transmission in schools . One explanation is that children may be less likely to transmit COVID to each other , either by being less infectious or by being less susceptible ( 14 , 38 ) . But transmission in schools does occur , and it’s worthwhile to estimate the magnitude and characterize the variation in it . One source of evidence for transmission in schools are school exposure reports . Throughout the pandemic organizations have collected data submitted by volunteers about COVID cases in schools , and such data has subsequently been published online ( 4 , 5 ) . Data consists of reports of exposures or clusters in schools , either submitted by parents , or determined from reading newspaper reports . Several such websites exist , though many ceased due to excessive workload after the 2020 – 21 school year . In some 2 .

Here we propose a simple model of transmission in schools , and we use these data on cluster sizes to estimate parameters of the model for various jurisdictions in the US and Canada . Our model allows for heterogeneity in transmission rate , which is able to capture the considerable variability in the sizes of the clusters , with most exposures leading to no further cases ( and so a cluster of size 1 ) but with few having a large number of cases ( 36 ) . We estimate the the mean and overdispersion parameters for different jurisdictions . We then use our parameter estimates in a few different ways : ﬁrstly , we explore the overdispersion of cluster sizes in different jurisdictions , giving estimates of what fraction of all cases are in the 20 % largest of all clusters . Secondly , we are able to estimate how long we can expect to wait until we see clusters of a given size in a jurisdiction . Thirdly , we can get an estimate of the distribution of transmission rate β , the rate at which a single infected individual infects a susceptible person when they are in contact . This parameter , in turn , could be used to simulate school transmission and explore the impacts of interventions ( 37 ) as we explore for several parameter choices . Finally , two important changes have occurred in 2021 that we expect to impact cluster sizes in schools . On the one hand , in many jurisdictions , large portions of children aged 12 and up have been vaccinated with the Pﬁzer / BIONTech vaccine ( 35 ) . According to the extent to which the vaccine protects against infection , we expect cluster size will be reduced , as fewer students will be infected if they have been immunized . Observed cluster size may be reduced further even than this , if the vaccine allows harder - to - detect infections to occur . On the other hand , now more infectious variants of the coronavirus have emerged , most noticeably the Alpha variant and subsequently the Delta variant ( 7 ) . Increased trans - missibilty would suggest larger cluster sizes , certainly among unvaccinated ages , but the relative impact of vaccination and the new variants together is difﬁcult to gauge . Furthermore , both changes may lead to a change in the variability in cluster sizes . 2 Methods Our data consist of lists of clusters of conﬁrmed cases among students in schools for 8 US states and 4 Canadian provinces during the 2020 – 2021 school year . The US data was gathered from the National Educational Association website ( 4 ) ( originally started by Alisha Morris , an educator at a Kansas high school ) which collected data from news media and from reports submitted by volunteers ( 39 ) . We se - lected the 8 states with the most data available , and covering the period between August and November 2020 . Canadian data was contributed by Dr Shraddha Pai from COVID Schools Canada ( 5 ) , an initiative of the group Masks for Canada ( 1 ) . We included the 4 provinces from this data set with the most clusters recorded ( omitting provinces where there was only the total cases by school recorded ) ; entries ranged over the whole 2020 – 21 school year For both sources of data , each entry is a single cluster with number 3 .

For the US data we used conﬁrmed student cases for the cluster size , excluding teachers and staff ; for the Canadian data we used total cases . Information is usually not available about whether the students were in just one classroom , and some of the clusters exceed 30 students , so are likely not restricted to just one class . Accordingly , we interpret clusters as capturing all linked cases at a given school , and not just one classroom . Figure 1 shows histograms of the observed cluster size in the 12 jurisdictions . In Table 1 we show , for each jurisdiction , the number of clusters , the number of schools appearing , the number of schools with more than one reported cluster , the fraction of clusters that have only one observed case , and the average number of observed cases in the clusters . There are several striking differences between the US and Canadian data . There are substantially more clusters reported in Canada than in the US , despite the US states having greater population on average . This may partly be explained by the Canadian data being collected over a longer period than the US data , but this is likely not the full explanation : in Figure 2 ( top ) we show the rate ( in clusters per day ) that cases appear in the dataset over time . In Figure 2 ( bottom ) we show rate of COVID incidence in the jurisdiction over the same period of time . Even at times when both US and Canadian datasets record clusters , Canadian rates are higher than US rates . This suggests that the method used for gathering cluster reports in different jurisdictions varied substantially between jurisdictions , especially when we look at daily incident cases in each . Statewide incident cases were generally higher per capita in US states than Canadian provinces . In the US data , cluster reports do not track well with incidence , but in the Canadian data there is a clear correspondence . Furthermore , the majority of schools in the US datasets only report one cluster , whereas the opposite is true of the Canadian data . There is also substantial differences in statistics of cluster sizes . Mean observed cluster sizes were without exception larger in the US states than Canadian provinces , and Canadian provinces tended to have a higher fraction of clusters with only one case . Given the incomplete nature of the US data , we cannot determine whether these differences are due to real differences in transmission in the jurisdictions , or because smaller clusters were less likely to be reported in the US states . There is substantial uncertainty in whether each reported cluster of cases accurately represents a set of cases linked by transmission . For any cluster of 2 or more cases , it may be that two independent sets of cases are incorrectly included in the same cluster . This may lead us to overestimate the size of clusters . Likewise , any two cluster in the the same school in the same week or adjacent weeks may actually be a single cluster misidentiﬁed as two . Both these factors may occur in our data , but we neglect both of them , taking the observed cluster size as given in the dataset . We are also unable to distinguish between transmission occurring in a school and in social activities with classmates outside of school . In a given jurisdiction , we assume exposure events occur according to a Poisson process with variable rate . Figure 2 ( top ) gives an estimate of the rate of exposure as a function of time for the dataset of each jurisdiction . Independently of this process , once an exposure event occurs at a school , we say Z 4 .

The variable Z includes individuals directly infected by the index case , as well as any subsequent infected individuals that are included in the same cluster . Following ( 25 ) , we model Z as a Poisson random variable with parameter ν , where ν itself is a Gamma - distributed random variable . As described by ( 25 ) , Z is then a negative binomial random variable . Rather than the usual parametrization of a negative binomial distribution we use parameters R c and k . The parameter R c is the expected number of additional infections in a cluster , and k is the dispersion : a measure of how far the distribution of Z is from being Poisson . As k → ∞ , the distribution of Z approaches that of a Poisson distribution with mean R c . The variance of Z is R c ( 1 + R c / k ) and so for smaller values of k we expect more of the secondary cases to occur in rare large clusters rather than in frequent small clusters ( 25 ) . There are then a total of Z + 1 infected individuals in the school . The number that are actually observed X depends on the ascertainment model . We consider a model where each case is observed and contributes to the reported cluster size with probability q , so that the observed cluster size X ( conditioned on Z ) is binomial with parameters n = Z + 1 and probability q . The index case is treated the same as the infectees , so X may or may not include the index case . If none of the cases in a cluster are observed , we assume the cluster is not reported , so our model factors in the effect that smaller clusters are more likely to be missed . For each collection of cluster sizes in our datasets we estimate the mean R c and dispersion k using the ascertainment model with q = 0 . 75 . We use maximum likelihood estimation to obtain estimates of R and k , and we use the Hessian of the log - likelihood to obtain 95 % conﬁdence ellipses for the 7 .

See the Supplementary Information for an explicit statement of the likelihood function . 3 Results Figure 3 ( left ) shows the estimated mean cluster size ( = R c + 1 ) and dispersion k for the 8 US states . Figure 3 ( right ) shows the same for 4 Canadian provinces . In the US data , mean cluster size was es - timated to range from about 2 in Texas to almost 8 in Florida . Dispersions ranged from 0 . 05 to 0 . 3 , showing considerable overdispersion compared to the Poisson distribution . In the Canadian provinces mean cluster sizes ranged between 1 . 3 and 1 . 7 cases , and dispersion ranged from 0 . 28 to 0 . 45 , meaning that observed dispersion was lower than in the US data ( recalling that no overdispersion corresponds to k → ∞ . ) In the Supplementary Information we explore varying the ascertainment fraction between 0 . 2 and 1 . Though lower ascertainment fractions yield bigger values of R c and smaller values of k , we see that the parameter estimates are relatively insensitive to values of q between 0 . 5 and 1 . The reason for this is that though a given cluster with multiple cases will look smaller with fewer cases detected , and therefore biasing observed size downwards , many single - case clusters will not be detected at all , biasing the observed cluster size upwards again . We also consider an alternate model of ascertainment , where the chance of a cluster being reported at all depends on the size of the cluster , and vary the rate of ascertainment in it ; see the Supplementary Information . As a way of interpreting dispersion values and what they mean for cluster size , we consider the fraction of all cases that occur in the largest 20 % of all clusters .

Dots indicate the location of selected jurisdictions in the plots . Pareto principle ( 43 ) then 80 % of the cases will be in the top 20 % largest clusters . ) If we consider only secondary cases ( not including the index case ) we see from Figure 4 ( right ) the fraction that are due to the 20 % largest clusters for various values of mean cluster size and k . For example , for Alberta with a mean cluster size of 1 . 6 and a dispersion k of 0 . 3 , 86 % of the secondary cases are in the top 20 % of the clusters by size . For Florida , with a mean cluster size of 8 and k = 0 . 075 , 97 % of secondary cases are in the top 20 % of clusters by size . When we include index cases , the fractions are correspondingly lower , as we see in Figure 4 ( right ) . Another way to visualize the variability of transmission we have inferred from the data is to show the distribution of the Poisson parameter ν , of which R c is just the mean . In our model ν is the index case - speciﬁc expected number of further cases in a cluster , and is a gamma distributed random vari - able . Figure 5 shows the estimated distribution of ν for each jurisdiction , and Table 3 shows some key properties of the jurisdictions . As another application of our results , we can estimate the time to observe a cluster of a given size or larger in a given jurisdiction . We used the estimate of rate of cluster occurrence shown in Figure 2 for the day September 15th , 2020 . Summing the tail of the cluster size distribution past a certain point with a given R c and k gives the fraction of clusters observed that are that size or larger . Multiplying these quantities and taking the inverse gives the expected number of days until we would see a cluster this size for larger in the dataset . We show the results of this calculation in Figure 6 . These vary widely : in our estimates for Florida , it would take under 5 days for there to be a cluster of 10 cases , whereas in Indiana this would not happen until 11 or 12 days , and in Alberta it would take over 50 days . Our model does not consider the details of transmission at the individual level , and so does not make use of an instantaneous transmission rate per contact pair . However , by making some simple assumptions 9 .

Recall that ν is a Gamma - distributed random variable that gives mean number of secondary cases . Another way to estimate mean cluster size is to use an individual contact model where when an infectious person is in contact with a susceptible person , the susceptible person is infected with rate β . In such a model we assume that infected individuals are in a classroom for 2 days before isolating ( when they develop symptoms ) , and that the total contact time with their classmates is T = 12 hours . Assuming that all individuals are in the same class , the infected individual is in contact with n = 25 other susceptible students for that time period . Then the infected individual will on average infect βnT other students . So we estimate β = ν / ( nT ) . Since ν is Gamma - distributed , our estimate of β is too . The approximations here are only reasonable when it’s plausible that all secondary infections 11 .

So we estimate the distribution of β this way only for the Canadian data sets . Figure 5 ( right ) shows with the right y - axis the distribution of β for the different Canadian provinces .

In units of hours − 1 , with 95 % credible intervals for the mean and standard deviation . One application of these estimates of the distribution of β is that we can explore the consequences of different types of interventions in the classroom setting . In ( 37 ) the authors consider a simple model of COVID - 19 transmission among a group of contacts and investigate the quantity R event , the average num - ber of secondary infections due to the presence of a single infectious individual . R event is determined by T , the total length of time the infectious individual is with others ; n contact , the number of contacts at any point in time , τ the length of time the individual is with a ﬁxed set of contacts ; and β , the instantaneous transmission rate . Interventions can be classiﬁed according to which of these parameters they modify : reducing transmission reduces β , social distancing reduces n contact , and ”bubbling” ( staying with the same small group rather than mingling ) increases τ to T . If use our distributions for β with the model of ( 37 ) we can estimate how the distribution of cluster sizes is changed with different interventions under different values of the parameters R c and k . In Figure 7 we show estimated size distributions of clusters under different interventions . Our base - line simulation settings intend to capture a pre - COVID high school classroom : T = 12 hours ( two days of exposure before the index case isolates ) , τ = 3 hours ( each student has four different classes that they attend , n class = 25 , and β is sampled from our estimated distribution for a given choice of R c and k . We consider three interventions : reducing transmission ( for example , by introducing masks ) reduces β by a factor of 2 ; social distancing cuts the size of a class in half ; strict bubbling sets τ to T . Figure 7 ( left ) shows the distributions of cluster size with the baseline and the different interventions for choices of R c and k appropriate to Saskatchewan ( R c = 0 . 5 , k = 0 . 3 ) . We see that both reducing transmission and social distancing are effective , whereas bubbling does not contribute much to reduce cluster sizes . This is 12 .

Left : under parameter choice R = 0 . 5 and k = 0 . 3 . Right : with 10 times as large R c . characteristic of what ( 37 ) call the linear regime : the number of secondary infections depends linearly on the time the infectious person is present with others . Figure 7 ( right ) shows the results in a hypothetical setting where R is much larger ( R c = 0 . 5 , k = 0 . 3 ) . Here transmission reduction is less effective than in the linear regime , and strict bubbling more so ; these parameters have moved us closer to the so - called saturating regime . 4 Discussion We have used cluster size data to estimate the mean and dispersion in cluster sizes , accounting for imper - fect case detection . We have found that in all jurisdictions in our data , the majority of school transmission occurs in a small number of classrooms , with the top 20 % of clusters containing between 80 % and 100 % of the secondary cases in school settings . We developed a method to estimate the transmission rate per contact per unit time , with reference to a simple model of classroom transmission . Having a direct estimate of the transmission rate allows us to compare the beneﬁts of different control measures . We ﬁnd that with parameters estimated from Canadian jurisdictions , interventions that reduce transmission rates ( such as masking ) and reduce number of contacts at any one time ( class size reduction ) , are more effective than strategies aimed at keeping sets of contacts consistent ( such as bubbling ) . Overdispersion in transmission of COVID - 19 and other infectious diseases is well documented ( eg ( 45 ) ) and is often described with reference to the 20 / 80 rule : that 20 % of the infected individuals account for 80 % of the transmission . Naturally , if the more infectious 20 % can be identiﬁed , interventions targeting that portion of the population are likely to have a high impact . For SARS in 2003 , Lloyd - Smith et al ( 25 ) estimated that 20 % of the cases were responsible for almost 90 % of the transmission . Estimates 13 .

These estimates focus on the distribution of the number of people an infectious person infects directly during the whole course of infection ( with mean R 0 ) , which is of obvious epidemiological importance , but for which it is difﬁcult to obtain high - quality data . When a case is identiﬁed , we are not always able to determine who they infected , and indirect methods must be used . We may miss cases , and others may be wrongly attributed to a given index case . In our present study , we examined a different random quantity , the number of additional cases Z infected , either directly or through intermediaries , by a given index case in a given setting . We denoted the mean of Z by R c . Including the index case means that the cluster size is Z + 1 , with mean R c + 1 . Compared to estimates of R 0 , R c does not count people infected at other sites , but it does include addi - tional cases , because it includes both direct and indirect transmission . Z and its mean R c are therefore more focused on the particular setting ( in this case a school ) than R 0 is . In general it will depend on the infectiousness of the index case , as well as how conducive the environment is to transmission , and what activities are undertaken there . Determining the distribution of Z , as we have done here , provides an alternative means of investigating transmission . However , these two measures of transmissibility ( R 0 and R c , the mean of Z ) may be close enough that it is instructive to compare our estimates for Z with the traditional R 0 , and our dispersion estimates with dispersion estimates for the number of secondary infections . Our R c ranges from 0 . 3 in Ontario to nearly 7 in Florida . The lower range of R c is inconsistent with R 0 estimates ( which range from 2 to 6 ( 3 ) ) , and indicate that in these jurisdictions schools are unlikely to be a major contributor to COVID - 19 spread . Our medium to higher estimates of R c are consistent with estimates of R 0 and suggest that school transmissions were an important factor in COVID transmission in general in these jurisdictions at these times . Our estimates for k range from 0 . 06 ( in Indiana ) to 0 . 5 ( in Alberta ) , corresponding closely to earlier estimates of dispersion . Overdispersion has consequences for controlling transmission and for estimation . Estimating the average transmission rate from a small number of clusters will be difﬁcult , and will result in a high variability . Most likely what will be observed in a small number of sampled clusters will be little to no onward transmission , which would lead to underestimates of the transmission rate . But if one or more larger clusters are included in a sample by chance , then this could lead to an overestimate of the transmission rate . If we could identify the conditions under which the rare larger clusters occur ( high - risk individu - als , activities and settings ) we could achieve a disproportionately large effect on reducing transmission by applying new measures in these settings . There are myriad possible reasons for overdispersion of transmission for SARS - CoV - 2 , including variation in viral load ( 10 ) , behaviour , and number of contacts . Properties of the setting may be very important , with some settings ( cramped , poor ventilation ) being 14 .

It would be good to identify classrooms or schools where there is a high risk of larger clusters . For example , if data were available on the occupancy , ventilation standards , mask use , classroom size , distancing behaviour and other features of classrooms , we could investigate how this related to the cluster size . Rapid tests may be especially good for identifying the most infectious individuals , given that they are sensitive to viral loads ( 27 ) , but additional data collection is likely needed to quantify setting - level risks . Two important changes have happened since the majority of the data here was collected . Firstly , in the jurisdictions studied , effective vaccines have been developed and deployed for those aged 12 and up ( 35 ) . There are several ways in which this may effect cluster sizes in the school setting . To the extent that the general population ( including adults ) being vaccinated reduces incidence of COVID ( 23 , 26 , 44 ) , there will be fewer introductions of COVID into the classroom , and so fewer exposures will occur leading to fewer clusters . This effect may be dampened by relaxation of distancing and other measures that were keeping COVID - 19 at bay and are no longer necessary in the context of vaccination . The distribution of cluster sizes when clusters do occur will also change : many students who might otherwise be infected will be protected by the vaccine , others who are vaccinated but infected ( breakthrough infection ) may have reduced symptoms and therefore may not be detected . We therefore expect the mean cluster size to be reduced by vaccination , in age ranges where vaccination has been deployed . It is unclear what the consequences will be for the dispersion . Secondly , new , more transmissible variants of SARS - CoV - 2 have emerged ( 6 ) , most notably the Alpha variant with a transmissibility approximately 1 . 5 times higher than that of the original variant , and the Delta variant estimated to have a transmissibility 1 . 5 times higher than that ( 15 ) . A natural way to implement this change in our model is to multiply R c by a factor of 2 . 25 , boosting the size of clusters , without changing the dispersion parameter k . This would result in mean cluster sizes ranging from 1 . 7 in Ontario to 16 in Florida according to our estimates . Data from the period in which Delta was the prevalent strain is not available , but schools in the Canada and the US saw resurgences in clusters in schools around school openings ( 2 , 13 , 33 ) . Our data and model have some limitations . The data rely on crowdsourcing , and there is reason to believe that reporting is incomplete . Larger clusters may be more likely to be reported . The rate at which exposures were reported in these data varies a great deal from state to state , and so these results cannot be used to estimate the true rate of exposures in schools in the jurisdictions . For example , California and New York are some of the most populous states in the US , both of which were severely hit by COVID during this period , and yet neither of them had enough reports to make it into the top 8 most reported states . However , the consistency of the Canadian estimates , despite the data being from different juris - dictions with different reporting , lend them credibility . In the modelling , we assumed a Poisson random variable for the cluster size , with an underlying gamma - distributed rate variable . This is a ﬂexible model allowing for considerable overdispersion , but it is simple and does not explicitly handle complexities 15 .

Our estimates of the transmission rate were derived ( where feasible ) from a model with a ﬁxed number of hours that the index case would be infectious in the classroom , and ﬁxed class sizes . Accounting for variation in these would result in more variability in the estimates . We also assumed that reported clusters in the Canadian data occurred in the same class . Errors where distinct clusters are incorrectly put together and errors where one larger cluster is incorrectly split and assumed to be two distinct clusters probably both occur in the data . Without ad - ditional information , however , we were not able to account for them . Finally , our illustrative modelling of the impact of interventions was simple , and used simple assumptions for the impacts of masking , dis - tancing and cohorts ( bubbling ) . Our estimates of the per - contact transmission rate per unit time could , however , be used in more sophisticated simulation modelling to compare interventions . Despite these limitations , our approach has distinct advantages . We have developed estimates of the person - to - person transmission rate derived directly from data . The data we use ( cluster sizes ) are relatively easy to access . This approach does not require individual - level data or contact tracing informa - tion , which are often not available ; individuals may be identiﬁable and data are held within public health institutions . Our estimation approach , together with cluster size data , offers a high - resolution view of transmission : we can estimate the distribution of cluster sizes in speciﬁc settings , accounting for report - ing and overdispersion , and in some contexts we can estimate the transmission rate , all without requiring either individual - level data or assumptions on transmission parameters such as the serial interval ( see , in contrast , ( 12 , 40 ) which require serial interval estimates ) . The results offer context - speciﬁc tools to sim - ulate interventions in particular settings ( here , schools ) . The methods are readily generalizable to other structured settings , such as workplace outbreaks where workplaces are similar in size and structure . Our results also suggest the need for data collection activities that can relate cluster sizes to setting variables such as occupancy , density , ventilation , activity and distancing behaviour . Ultimately this would provide the data needed to design interventions that best reduce school and / or workplace transmission .

Supplementary Information Model for Cluster Size We consider two models for ascertainment ( whether a case is actually detected ) , though we only consider the ﬁrst in the main text . In the ﬁrst ascertainment model ( Individual Ascertainment ) each of the infected individuals is detected with a probability q 1 . So X , the total number of infected individuals is binomial ( n , p ) with parameters n = Z + 1 and p = q 1 . If by chance none of the individuals are observed , we do not observe the cluster . This is meant to model a situation where cases are detected independently of each other , and one detected case does not lead to further tests or screening . In the second ascertainment model ( Cluster Ascertainment ) , at ﬁrst each case is identiﬁed with probability q 2 , but then if any of the students are identiﬁed they are all subsequently identiﬁed . This is intended to capture a situation where a single detected case triggers testing for the whole class . Again , if no cases are detected we do not observe the cluster . This is equivalent to saying that clusters of size m are detected in their entirety with probability 1 − ( 1 − q 2 ) m . The number Z of new cases given the presence of one infectious case is a Poisson distributed random variable with a rate ν that is itself a Gamma - distributed random variable with a shape k and scale θ . This means Z has a negative binomial distribution NB ( r , p ) where r = k and p = θ / ( 1 + θ ) . Letting Θ = ( k , θ ) , the cdf of Y is P ( Z = j ) = V Θ ( j ) = Γ ( j + r ) j ! Γ ( r ) ( 1 − p ) r p j . Under the individual ascertainment model with ascertainment probability q 1 , X , the number of observed cases is binomial ( n , p ) with n = Z + 1 and p = q 1 . So , the probability that i individuals are observed is W Θ , q 1 ( i ) = ∞ (cid:88) j = 0 (cid:18) j + 1 i (cid:19) V Θ ( j ) q i 1 ( 1 − q 1 ) j + 1 − i for i = 0 , 1 , . . . . Since we do not observe clusters with no observed cases the probability of observing a cluster of size i is actually P ( X = i ) = C − 1Θ , q 1 W Θ , q 1 ( i ) for i = 1 , 2 , . . . , where C Θ , q 1 = (cid:80) ∞ i = 0 W Θ , q 1 .

So the probability of observing X = j in a cluster is U Θ , q 2 ( i ) = [ 1 − ( 1 − q 2 ) i ] V Θ ( i ) for i = 0 , 1 , . . . but then since we cannot observe clusters of size 0 , an observed cluster has size i with probability P ( X = i ) = D − 1Θ , q 2 U Θ , q 2 ( i ) for i = 1 , 2 , . . . , where D Θ , q 1 = (cid:80) ∞ i = 0 U Θ , q 2 ( i ) . If the observed cluster sizes are X i , i = 1 , . . . , n , the log - likelihood function for Θ = ( k , θ ) under the cluster ascertainment model is then n (cid:88) i = 1 log (cid:104) D − 1Θ , q 2 U Θ , q 2 ( X i ) (cid:105) Under both ascertainment models , we then go from our estimates of k and Θ to estimates of R c via the formula R c = pr 1 − p = kθ . We use the Delta method to obtain conﬁdence intervals for R c from conﬁdence intervals on k and θ . Varying the rate and model of ascertainment In the main text we estimated parameters with the assumption of the individual ascertainment model with an ascertainment probability of 0 . 75 . Here we investigate how our main parameters R c + 1 ( expected cluster size ) and k ( dispersion ) vary with this ascertainment probability . We also consider the alternate ascertainment model discussed in the previous section Model for Cluster Size . Figure 8 shows the parameter estimates for the two models . On the left we show the results for the US states , and on the right for the Canadian provinces . The top plots show results for the individual ascertainment model where we set q 2 = 1 and vary q 1 from 0 . 2 to 1 . The bottom plots show results for the group ascertainment model with q 1 = 1 and q 2 varying from 0 . 2 to 1 . We see that the parameters do vary with the model and the ascertainment fraction , but relative magnitudes of the parameters in different jurisdictions do not change . In particular , for a range of q 1 greater than 0 . 5 in the individual ascertainment model , there is little change in the parameter estimates . 22 .
