However , social innovation does not start directly with action but presupposes the creation of meaningful encounters between participants , which requires corresponding commons to allow for various meetings , conversations , and actions that are not circumscribed . Based on literature research and practical experi - ence , this paper argues that trust - building is the key to creating relational commons . This paper reviews literature about trust and participatory design , uncovers a vision of future co - creative com - munities based on trust and blockchain of DAO ( Decentralized Autonomous Organization ) as a new organizational form , and an - alyzes in detail the trust mechanisms of participatory design for social innovation , leading to a theoretical framework . This frame - work argues that shaping trust’s cognitive and affective foundations is crucial to building a social innovation network . Subsequent re - search will enable the integration of blockchain technology with the theoretical framework and verify the model’s validity through empirical studies .

Usually , such a process occurs in the early stages of design , where collecting data , ideating , and generating concepts happen [ 37 ] . Therefore , it is vital whether users can present their initiative in a co - creation space where they are equal , open , and learn from each other [ 11 , 60 ] . Because it determines whether this participatory design process can echo its prerequisite assumptions : “a belief in the right of peo - ple to codetermination of their living and working conditions , an awareness of how participation can lead to more appropriable and usable systems [ 4 ] . ” Trust as the premise and basis for creating this space has been discussed by many researchers [ 10 , 15 , 17 , 54 , 65 ] . Participatory design usually occurs at the fuzzy front end of design [ 52 ] , a phase where more general problems happen . It is also a critical phase , including understanding users and contexts of use , exploration and selection of new materials and information technologies [ 57 ] ( see Figure 1 ) . The goal of front - end exploration is to determine what to de - sign . This exploration is followed by the traditional design process , including specific prototyping and further product development and testing . However , as designers deal with more and more com - plex problems [ 45 ] , and the social issues faced in the critical phase become more and more open , it is difficult to determine precisely what kind of concept we are aiming for , what kind of materials we are using , and what form the output will take . Thus new participa - tory design practices are emerging , which front - load the prototype phase and incrementally produce change through “practice” and “implementation” 1 of these solutions , then continually reflect on and adjust design actions [ 45 ] . In response to this trend , some participatory design practitioners are turning to design for social 1 Definition of Social Innovation in OECD ( Organisation for Economic Co - operation and Development ) .

Figure 2 : Example of NICE COMMUNE’s social network growth in early July 2020 ( Illustrated by the authors ) innovation . Social innovation and participatory design are inter - twined because social innovation is both the driving force and the goal of participatory design [ 37 ] . In these social innovation practices , new ideas come from various roles directly involved in solving the problem : end - users , grassroots designers , technicians and entrepreneurs , local institutions , and civil society organizations [ 37 ] . Unlike “traditional” participatory design , the researcher’s presence is significantly reduced , and the birth of action comes directly from the user’s initiative ideas , with the designer only acting as a facilitator in the process . Based on participatory design , social innovation emphasizes openness and the designer’s ability to concretely implement the initiative and result in ‘social’ enterprises [ 24 ] . The designer’s role shifts to designing platforms that make it easy to assemble project teams or virtual organizations [ 43 ] . Some researchers have also referred to the related toolkit of design methodologies [ 9 ] and the public spaces ( both real and virtual ) that host participatory design as infrastructures [ 4 , 9 , 21 ] . Other researchers realize the importance of interpersonal relationships in social innovation [ 46 ] . Since social innovation is a continuous process , it requires a long - term mutual trust relationship . Espe - cially in community - based social innovation [ 35 ] , trust is not only the designer’s passport to the community [ 19 ] but also the key and challenge to integrating into the community in a continuous co - creation [ 27 ] . Ji et al . [ 25 ] analyze 20 cases of social innovation involving com - munity building in mainland China , and they clarify that design subjects generally find it difficult but crucial to enter communities . Furthermore , it often requires building relationships based on trust and maintaining those relationships through ongoing dialogic in - teraction . Among their practices , NICE COMMUNE is a growing sub - project of NICE 2035 Living Line [ 35 ] in the “cluster building” phase . It attracts different actors and participants through offline activities , online promotions , or “word of mouth” and becomes a composite online and offline community , with many forms of participatory design happening constantly . “The community of NICE COMMUNE is a network of individuals and groups of dif - ferent strengths and interactions between different levels , and it has formed an open social system made up of a superposition of different types of social capital [ 36 ] . ” ( see Figure 2 ) As practitioners deeply involved in the co - creation of NICE COM - MUNE projects , we have summarized several models for building and maintaining interactions and found four insights 2 . Insight 1 : We need to leverage the trust of our neighbors to gen - erate new trust . When working with friends , especially friends of friends , who were unfamiliar before the new project began , we of - ten need to leverage trust in our “intermediary” friends to generate trust in the new partner . Insight 2 : In the prolonged fuzzy front end phase , existing trust relationships are challenging to maintain . Even if a good trust relationship has been established , since this trust is built in a short period , when faced with a social innovation full of uncertainty , participants have no explicit expectation of the cost they and others will invest in the growing project ( although they are not committed at the beginning , but have certain expectations ) . If others fail to meet their expectations ( e . g . , by investing sufficient human costs ) , feelings of disappointment and frustration arise , and the trusting relationship becomes precarious . Initially , established trust is fragile in this uncertain situation and can even hurt future cooperation . Insight 3 : The newly established trust relationship is not being effectively transferred . If one is fortunate enough to develop a pro - gram smoothly with a new participant and successfully maintain a trust relationship , this trust relationship is also a social relationship with a personal bias . The recognition and certification of partic - ipants in such a trusting relationship are full of subjectivity and highly personal emotions for other potential collaborators . More - over , due to the uncertainty of social innovation projects , much of the recognition and trust generated by relying on the organization or project disappears with the project’s failure or the organization’s dissolution and cannot be passed on to new potential participating individuals organizations or new projects . Based on literature and practical experience , we argue that trust - building is critical for participatory design in social innovation contexts . Therefore , this paper presents a theoretical review of trust mechanisms in participatory design , aiming to propose a theoretical framework that supports design exploration and helps to form a relational commons that can facilitate collaboration among different communities , projects , researchers , and actors . The paper is structured as follows : The second section of this article discusses the technical advan - tages of blockchain - based emerging collaborative organizations DAO ( Decentralized Autonomous Organization ) in enabling broad and active participation and co - creation . Blockchain technology serves as a vehicle for collaborative mechanisms that rely on mu - tual trust within organizations , inspiring more productive , just , and democratic co - creation . The third section of this article provides a literature review of the relationship between participatory design and trust , clarifying the critical role of trust in participatory design according to the design process . The fourth section of this article analyzes the trust mechanism of participatory design for social innovation . Social innovation is or - ganized in the form of network , which establishes connections and cooperation based on social capital , while trust is the core of social 2 The authors of this paper conducted a year and a half of action research at NICE COMMUNE and gained the following insights from analyzing daily field notes and team meetings . 95 Building Trust in Participatory Design to Promote Relational Network for Social Innovation PDC 2022 Vol . 2 , August 19 – September 01 , 2022 , Newcastle upon Tyne , United Kingdom capital . Based on the formation mechanism of trust experience , this paper argues that the cognitive base and affective base of trust can be used to promote mutual trust within the network to establish more high - quality connections , improve the social network , and stimulate more actions . The fifth section of this article is a summary of the whole paper . The sixth section of this article is the shortcomings of this study and future prospects . 2 WILL DAO BE THE FUTURE OF PARTICIPATORY DESIGN ? Currently , participatory design is still dominated by offline projects , especially community - based social innovation experiments repre - sented by NICE COMMUNE , which usually generate clusters of connections and start collaborations based on geographical loca - tions . Geographical conditions limit the scope of participants and actions , and the concept of design community is transforming an extension of the local neighborhood to a virtual space where online communities gather . From this perspective , we have observed an emerging organizational form , the DAO ( decentralized autonomous organization ) , which has shown great potential in stimulating broad social participation , prompting us to think about its technology and underlying mechanisms . A DAO is a decentralized online governance structure [ 16 ] . Like participatory design , where participants share decision - making power over the design , members of a DAO share the power to decide on the conditions of the projects . Specifically , participants within a DAO gather online and send proposals due to a shared vision . They vote together to decide the direction of the project . All participants receive corresponding rewards at the end of the project , creating a virtuous cycle that promotes action . The actions carried out in DAOs are diverse and cover a wide range of areas such as building infrastructure 3 , business investment 4 , and art collecting 5 . Thanks to the advantages of the Internet , people from different countries and regions can actively participate in the establishment and development of DAOs . These people share the same vision and diverse competencies and skills , which gives DAOs great cohe - sion and the ability to carry out diverse projects . However , such a complex membership also poses a governance challenge , as DAO projects often involve financial transactions , and most of the peers in a DAO rely on the Internet to generate connections , which means that every vote taken by members has to be incredibly deliberate . Building trust on the Internet is more complicated than offline . However , mutual trust within a DAO is critical to improving cohe - sion within the organization , and the blockchain technology that 3 Representative : Uniswap DAO , the parent organization of the uniswap protocol , is dedicated to building an infrastructure of decentralized crypto transaction protocols , onwhichhundredsofapplicationsontheblockchainarealreadybasedandwhichserveasanimportantfoundationforblockchainactivity .

PleaseDAO’s official website is https : / / pleasr . org / # main - menu - toggle DAOs rely on provides tremendous value for this purpose and offers a new perspective for studying participatory design . In participatory design , the process of cooperation between par - ticipants and the recognition of results are inevitably subjective , and the lack of certain essential information or the opaqueness of information can easily lead to the breakdown of trust between participants . But the underlying technology that DAOs rely on is the blockchain , a distributed public ledger [ 44 ] and is mainly shared and jointly maintained by the various distributed nodes in the blockchain system [ 66 ] . Thus , all nodes on the blockchain can broadcast and receive any information to the blockchain network . The public domain of the blockchain avoids ambiguity due to pri - vate sentiment orientation and ensures that information on any node is transparent and immutable , reducing the risk of mistrust in potential collaborations . On the other hand , blockchain also guarantees members’ trust and identification with the entire DAO organization , which helps maintain a shared sense of community and the purity of vision . Smart contracts [ 59 ] within DAOs are computer programs on the blockchain [ 47 ] , which can specify the rules and principles assigned in the code and automatically and strictly follow the code . Smart contracts allow participants within a DAO to trust the organiza - tion’s behavior by trusting the code in smart contracts . For example , smart contracts provide participants with compensation in advance and in strict accordance with the initial compensation system , with - out human interference in traditional companies . Therefore , the “prior agreement” and “strict implementation” of smart contracts vastly reduce the participants’ fear of uncertainty within the orga - nization and provide a stable and reliable context for the generation of trusting relationships . So that members can do their best to pro - mote the organization’s work . Trusting deterministic code is more palatable than trusting people full of uncertainty , so unlike previous participatory designs , DAOs are no longer limited to familiar trust teams but can expand to a broader range of people . DAOs are also worth thinking about in terms of incentive mechanisms . Token , a negotiable digital asset built on Ethereum Blockchain as well as proof of rights and interests [ 32 ] , is often used in DAOs as a means of voting and economic incentives . The blockchain’s timestamp technology allows precise metadata audit - ing through time series authentication , such as owner and time within the token . Once the shared data on the blockchain is de - termined by most distributed nodes , any subsequent changes are invalid [ 64 ] . Thus , the token can be considered an immutable au - thentication where any vote , proposal , and participation within a DAO can be recorded and retraced at any node , point , and time . The participants within a DAO can look back at the complete process of the project and the specific contribution of each participant , thus effectively motivating the participants to perform . With each DAO member acting as both owner and manager [ 20 ] , a DAO can operate efficiently and self - driven and inspire cooperation to complete the project for profit again and again . The DAO uses blockchain’s decentralization , traceability , and immutability to build a natural “trust” ground . In other words , even if people do not trust their teammates within a DAO too much at first , they can still facilitate collaboration by trusting the code . It is evident that the governance of DAOs needs to rely on trust 96 PDC 2022 Vol . 2 , August 19 – September 01 , 2022 , Newcastle upon Tyne , United Kingdom Man Zhang et al . Figure 3 : The role of trust in participatory design ( illustrated by the authors ) mechanisms [ 28 , 41 , 51 ] , which are enabled by the blockchain as a technological vehicle [ 22 , 42 ] . In summary , both participatory design communities and DAOs with new organizational mechanisms place great emphasis on trust among members in their organizational governance . We have wit - nessed the high potential of DAO’s blockchain technology for trust - building within organizations and for extending the scope of par - ticipation , which inspires social innovation - oriented participatory design . Small and interconnected local collaborative organizations gradually transition to online communities that grow in virtual space . The inevitable trend of forming extensive and high - quality collaborative social networks requires influential and trustwor - thy information and norms to guarantee trust among participants . We observe the great potential shown by blockchain technology , but technology is only a means or a vehicle ; what really makes blockchain work is its underlying trust logic . The face of technol - ogy is constantly updated over time , and in order to better harness it to improve human life , it is necessary to figure out the exact logic of the trust mechanism on which DAO relies . 3 TRUST AND PARTICIPATORY DESIGN Researchers generally agree that trust is essential for participatory design , but there is a lack of in - depth discussion on the role and mechanisms of trust . Suppose the timeline of a participatory design project is divided into before design , during design , and future design . Trust plays a different role in these three phases but is always the key to participatory design . After reviewing the relevant literature , this paper summarizes the role of trust in participatory design into three categories : permission to design , maintenance in design , and inspiration for future design ( see Figure 3 ) . 3 . 1 Permission to design Participatory design requires the active engagement of different parties , and establishing a trusting relationship between all par - ticipants is a prerequisite and basis for opening a participatory design [ 54 ] . And in this sense , trust is permission to participatory design [ 12 , 62 ] . Many literature and practice projects emphasize achieving good relationships between participants prior to design , considering trust - building as a key and challenging aspect of de - veloping subsequent design practices [ 23 , 29 , 65 ] . The groups that need to build relationships before a participatory design project begins are mainly design researchers and other participants . War - wick [ 62 ] demonstrates through an empirical study that initial trust is the crucial step to initiating co - creation and finds that partici - pants’ initial trust in the designer comes more from the designer’s trustworthiness than from the design methods or techniques the designer will use . This explains why researchers are often not eager to start design practice , but to negotiate with participants through workshops , interviews , ice - breaking activities , and other social be - haviors unrelated to design practice , thus facilitating trust building [ 12 ] . In community - based participatory design , trust is critical as per - mission of design . Getting an existing community into the process of co - creation is a susceptible part of participation because the community already has complete common sense and identification . Researchers conduct participatory design with the community as outsiders , so how the relationship is established will significantly impact the community’s willingness to enter [ 15 ] . This requires re - searchers to pay extra attention to the attributes and characteristics of the community itself to avoid the feeling of being offended from the community members until an excellent trusting relationship is established with the community before starting co - creation [ 19 ] . This means spending a considerable amount of time and labor on activities that are not directly related to design practice . Another way is to find intermediaries who can gain the trust of both the com - munity and the outside researchers , allowing the intermediaries to be the bridge that connects the trust relationship [ 27 , 56 ] . 3 . 2 Maintenance in design Participants can formally join the participatory design practice once the initial trust has been established as permission . At this stage , as participants with diverse characteristics come together , interpersonal relationships become more complex than before , and trust becomes more dynamic and sensitive . Even if a good initial trust has been established , participatory design will come to an end if the trust relationship breaks down at this stage . On the other hand , a good trust relationship is a lubricant for co - creation and can help participatory design overcome difficulties and risks . Thus , trust plays a maintenance role in the process of participatory design practice . The participatory design process can be seen as constructing a joint co - creation space for all participants to be equal , open , and learn from each other , and trust is the key factor in building this space [ 60 ] . A similar name to co - creation space is “safe spaces” , defined as environments that promote open communication , knowl - edge exchange , and beneficial engagements among all participants . And trust - building is the key enabler [ 11 ] . Another way of saying this is the ‘elbow room’ of co - realisation . Once the participants take on co - realization work , there is a commitment , which will lead to trust in other participants and thus face the risks in the co - realisation [ 10 ] . Følstad [ 17 ] argues that this co - creative relationship is characterized by mutual trust . He further explores the mutual dependency relationship between Co - creation and Trust . Trust is both the necessary precondition and the result of co - creation . Trust is like a lubricant that flows through the co - creation process and facilitates the realization of co - creation . Clarke et al . [ 12 ] also emphasized the interaction between co - production and trust , ar - guing that activities in co - creation enable contextually sensitive group understandings , empathy , and communication . The result - ing relationship of trust contributes to the further development of co - creation . 97 Building Trust in Participatory Design to Promote Relational Network for Social Innovation PDC 2022 Vol . 2 , August 19 – September 01 , 2022 , Newcastle upon Tyne , United Kingdom 3 . 3 Inspiration for future design Traditional participatory design is based on a project - based sys - tem , and when the above two phases are completed , participatory design is over . Going beyond the project itself and expanding the participation to a more continuous and broader sense of social en - gagement will lead to more social innovation . The wider network is the drive that shapes social innovation , which means building con - nections between different social identities so that stakeholders can co - create together [ 43 ] . Trust building is considered an infrastruc - ture to achieve social change [ 21 ] . Although it is not directly linked to future social change , the network constructed in this phase will support many unknown social innovation designs [ 46 ] . Therefore , this paper describes the role of trust in this phase as inspiration . A distinction needs to be made between trust as inspiration and trust as permission . While both represent preparation for the start of formal design practice , trust as permission points to sure par - ticipants and design goals , while trust as inspiration corresponds to uncertainty . As Bjögvinsson et al . [ 7 ] stated , “we have avoided having clearly predefined projects and project constellations . In - stead , our aim has been to create working relations that allow for various constellations to develop and for different possibilities to be explored . ” Compared with traditional participatory design projects , co - creation for social innovation prefers a bottom - up , generative approach to collaboration . Long - term trust relationship invisibly strengthens the social fabric [ 61 ] , and when the social fabric is rich enough , trust becomes the inspiration for social change . 4 TRUST MECHANISM IN PARTICIPATORY DESIGN FOR SOCIAL INNOVATION The previous section has illustrated the important role of trust con - struction for participatory design , especially in social innovation design , where maintaining good trust relationships is of paramount importance . Participatory design in social innovation attaches great importance to the value of co - creation and the active participation of all . Therefore , it is organized in the form of network rather than traditional market , hierarchical organization . There is no precise specification in networks , and different actors build relationships and cooperate based on the social capital flowing in the network . Social capital has been studied for a long time . It cannot be quanti - fied and has complicated connotations . However , trust is its core , functioning with social capital in a dynamic cycle of mutual causa - tion . Disregarding other variables , if trust is enhanced , social capital subsequently increases , and social networks may be more affluent , stimulating more social innovation actions . Considering the plu - rality of trust judgments , trustworthiness is the key to regulating trust and corresponds to the cognition basis of trust . In addition to the cognitive basis of trust , however , affect - based trust is also essential to forming closer ties . 4 . 1 Cooperation in participatory design through social network 4 . 1 . 1 Social network and social capital . Participatory design in so - cial innovation is often under informal social control and rarely defines norms with mandatory effect . On the one hand , no managers govern participatory design respecting equal power [ 8 ] . Therefore it cannot be managed through a hierarchical relationship between the top and bottom . On the other hand , participatory design em - phasizes that participants should be aware of their responsibilities in design and take the initiative to contribute [ 54 ] . To maintain the emotions between the participants and keep the design process open , it is not easy to set norms for collaboration of a commercial nature . This means that it is not the strict market - based contractual norms nor the hierarchical organizational constraints on power that sustain partnerships . It is through networks of individuals engaged in reciprocal , preferential , mutually supportive actions [ 48 ] . While sociology views networks 6 as groups of people connected by relatively loose social ties or relationships , more scholars want to unify broad social forms into networks using a perspective beyond organizations . Social innovation tends to be loosely structured by relatively informal social ties . As social interactions continue , more identifiable features emerge [ 63 ] , for instance , community [ 6 ] or more formal organizations . If participants are considered as distinct nodes , these nodes are highly individualistic , and there is often no connection between individual nodes . To establish high - quality relationships among individual nodes , sufficient trust and negotiation are required without formal constraints such as discrete exchanges , administrative fiat , and laws . Networks rely on social capital to coordinate the relationships among participants to cooperate . Interactions between nodes shape social relationships , and the structure and content of social relation - ships are the sources of social capital . Social capital is a relatively well - established and important concept in the social sciences . It is the goodwill available to individuals or groups , and its effects flow from the information , influence , and solidarity it makes available to the actor [ 1 ] . Unlike what economists call “capital , ” social capital is difficult to measure quantitatively [ 55 ] . It both emerges from social relationships and shapes new ones , and the quality of social capital will affect a collective’s ability to cooperate to solve common problems [ 58 ] . 4 . 1 . 2 Trust as the core of social capital . According to Francis Fukuyama , “social capital can be defined simply as an instanti - ated set of informal values or norms shared among members of a group that permits them to cooperate with one another . Suppose members of the group come to expect that others will behave reli - ably and honestly . In that case , they will trust one another . Trust acts like a lubricant that makes any group or organization run more efficiently [ 18 ] ” . Trust is both a key source of social capital [ 49 ] and a basic form of social capital [ 13 ] , as well as a relational asset formed by the collection of social capital [ 33 ] . The more trust a person gains from others , the more social capital he has in stock . As social capital increases , it becomes easier for him to establish good relationships with others , form richer social networks , and thus gain more peo - ple’s or higher quality trust . Therefore , trust and social capital are in a circular relationship . By adjusting the variable of trust , one can change one’s social capital and thus influence the structure and content of the network . Considering the characteristics of cooperation in participatory design based on the network for social innovation , building mutual trust is the focus of reducing the obstacle of social capital circulation 6 It’s also named social network . 98 PDC 2022 Vol . 2 , August 19 – September 01 , 2022 , Newcastle upon Tyne , United Kingdom Man Zhang et al . in the network . So that social capital can better play the role of “glue”betweenvariousrelationshipsandestablishmoreconnectionsbetweennodes . In turn , organizing social relationships will further expand and enrich social networks , cultivate new social capital , and generate more actions . 4 . 2 The way to build trust in networks 4 . 2 . 1 The psychological mechanism of trust . Generally speaking , trust is recognized as an expression of confidence between the parties in exchange for some kind - confidence that they will not be harmed or put at risk by other parties’ actions [ 3 , 5 , 67 ] . People experience trust in a psychological sense under the joint function of values , attitudes , moods and emotions [ 26 ] . Values determine the criteria of trust judgment . Attitudes are the assessment of others’ trustworthiness . Moods and emotions are the feelings people have when interacting with others and signal the fundamental aspects and quality of the trust experience . Trust arises in mutual influence and dynamic change of these three aspects . Our framework focuses on the aspect of attitudes for several reasons . Firstly , trust is a very personal experience . Values are rela - tively stable , and moods and emotions tend to vary from person to person . Attitudes , however , are more dependent on the trustworthi - ness exhibited by others , usually based on experience , knowledge , and interactions [ 50 ] . Therefore it is unethical to cause monolithic trust judgments through outside interventions , but it is feasible to demonstrate one’s trustworthiness based on facts , which provides more evidence for attitudes . Secondly , attitudes make trust expe - rienced at a specific level and structure the experience of trust in specific ongoing relationships [ 26 ] . Thus , attitudes are a crucial variable affecting establishing cooperative ties between nodes . 4 . 2 . 2 Trust based on cognition and affect . Trust develops from cog - nitive evaluations of the trustworthiness of other people and groups [ 31 ] . The trustworthiness factors are ability , benevolence , and in - tegrity [ 39 ] . Ability is the competencies shown in a specific task . Benevolence means the extent to which a trustee is believed to do good to the trustor . Integrity is related to the trustee’s compliance with mutual agreements and social norms . Based on understand - ing others’ information , people evaluate and decide whether to start cooperating after considering the expectation and risks of cooperation , so it is a kind of cognitive trust . Cognition for trust is based on information from another person about uncertain environmental states and their accompanying out - comes in a risky situation [ 53 ] . Moreover , the amount of necessary information required for trust is somewhere between total knowl - edge and total ignorance [ 40 ] . It also shows that trust judged on the basis of information is conditional and that trust is gained only if the trustee exhibits sufficient information for trustworthiness . Although it is impossible to define how much information is suffi - cient , people tend to develop trust via more details [ 30 ] . The cost of establishing direct trust is high , and indirect trust is a powerful complement when there is a lack of direct contact between nodes in a network . Besides generating direct interaction with the trustee , information comes from third parties . In fact , in our participatory design practice over the past year , more of our collaborators are not directly connected to us but know and trust us through third parties . These people or organizations then transmit our information to the more extensive network , providing a more informed basis for others to evaluate our trustworthiness and thus enter into more collaborations . Besides cognition , trust also emerges based on affect [ 40 ] . It is the affective investment people make in the trust relationship , express - ing care and concern for the collaborator in multiple interactions and believing that the trust relationship is mutually beneficial . Trust between strangers is often based on cognition , but as interactions increase , affect - based trust develops , influencing the assessment of someone’s trustworthiness . This suggests that participants who are not familiar with each other first need to establish conditional trust , which some scholars also refer to as calculative trust [ 62 ] . However , each time conditional trust starts , it takes a lot of time and effort for the participants to gather enough information . In order to enhance the efficiency of co - creation and open up possibilities for future collaboration , it is necessary to rely not only on conditional trust but also to reach unconditional trust as much as possible by strengthening the emotional basis between participants . As interactions increase , the conditional trust may accumulate into unconditional trust , and the affective connection between par - ties will be strengthened . Once unconditional trust exists , parties effectively understand and agree with each other’s ideas , values , and logic , thus reducing communication costs and allowing for quick responses and cooperation . The relationship between parties is critical in maintaining unconditional trust by reinforcing the sense of mutual identification [ 30 ] . It is worth noting that , besides direct interaction , the more cooperation reached based on indirect trust , the more information circulates in the network . When people who are not familiar with each other can judge their identity , group , interests , and attributes through information , it is also possible to form a sense of mutual identification . Therefore , it is possible to es - tablish affective ties between indirect nodes without relationships , thus facilitating the occurrence of unconditional trust . Regulating trustworthiness will help build cognition - based trust between nodes interacting less frequently . But the vision of social innovation is to create high - quality social connections in networks , bringing together people with a high sense of identity to form distinct innovation curatorial commons . These commons are in - terconnected , and people or organizations can flow freely among different commons so that ideas and resources can flow efficiently in the network and inspire more actions . In order to establish and maintain this high - quality connection , affect - based trust is also critical . Therefore , we consider a combination of these two bases of trust . 4 . 3 Summary of the theoretical framework To sum up , we argue that more mutual trust can be built in the net - work based on cognition and affect , resulting in more participatory design practices for social innovation . In turn , these practices are equivalent to establishing new social connections that will further enrich the network ( see Figure 4 ) . The specific explanation of this diagram is as follows . People mainly rely on social capital to build connections and cooperate in a network . Social capital is difficult to quantify and has a broad meaning , but trust is the core of social capital . Therefore , 99 Building Trust in Participatory Design to Promote Relational Network for Social Innovation PDC 2022 Vol . 2 , August 19 – September 01 , 2022 , Newcastle upon Tyne , United Kingdom Figure 4 : Diagram of a trust - building system in social net - work ( illustrated by the authors ) promoting mutual trust will help foster social capital and more quality cooperation in the network . The cognitive basis of trust is the judgment of a person’s trust - worthiness based on information , which is a prerequisite for build - ing a relationship of mutual trust . However , in order to maintain relationships in networks , not only cognition - based trust is needed , but also affect - based trust . Affect - based trust comes from maintain - ing affective ties through interaction . At the same time , sufficient information can also prove the sense of mutual identity and help form the affect - based trust . Building mutual trust based on cognition and affect is conducive to nurturing social capital , thus promoting co - creation within the network based on social capital . At the same time , as more collabo - ration takes place , new social ties are established , and the quality of social relations will gradually increase , resulting in a more pros - perous social network . The structure and content of new social networks will generate more materials for trust . 5 CONCLUSION The discipline of design has made it its mission to “inspire soci - ety as a whole to extend the concept of long - term human benefit to include the preservation and protection of the sustainability of all four systems ( nature , humans , the networked world , and arti - ficial things ) [ 34 ] . Social innovation provides us with a vision of “project - centered democracy” [ 38 ] . Building the “commons” of the human future by participatory design with the scattered forces of innovation is a question that cannot be avoided . After a theoretical discussion , this paper argues that participa - tory design in the context of social innovation is based on the organizational form of network for cooperation and illustrates the importance of promoting mutual trust for its cooperation . Based on the mechanism of trust formation , we believe that constructing the cognitive and affective foundations of trust is the key to pro - moting this type of co - creation . We also explored the potential of blockchain technology applied by DAOs in enabling an extensive network of mutual trust , both as a binding mechanism and as a symbol of openness and democracy , in a globally interconnected network that can connect more social relationships , expand more social networks , and cultivate more social capital to generate more actions . We hope to create relational commons that encourage social innovation actors to generate links and value identities , par - ticipate in community co - governance , and sustain social innovation practices . This study is just the beginning of a theoretical exploration of trust mechanisms in participatory design . The final goal of this framework is to build social innovation commons with online and offline integration , forming a wide range and high - quality social networks . So that all kinds of resources and ideas can circulate freely among the nodes and stimulate more innovative actions . Commu - nities are a key source of social innovation design , and blockchain technology will further break down the regional limitations of com - munities , making more bottom - up co - creation participation possi - ble [ 2 ] . As the level of trust deepens , unconditional trust within the network will overtake conditional trust , accelerating the formation of a sense of community , shaping more community cooperation , and stimulating more potential . 6 FUTURE WORK In participatory design , there are still problems of “pseudo - participation” , such as uneven distribution of power and reduced willingness of participants to participate [ 14 ] . It has been suggested that the impetus to ensure voluntary collaboration is yet to be stud - ied . Maintaining interpersonal mutual trust in the process needs to be further explored . In addition , since trust itself is not controllable and the outcome of mutual trust is still influenced by individuals’ judgment of social capital resulting in value differences , additional research on the value of social capital judgment is needed . Follow - up research will focus on a prototype through trust theo - retical framework combined with blockchain technology . However , the high threshold of blockchain technology is prone to problems such as power tilt and vicious technical competition , and the bind - ing force of technology on trust needs to be tested by relying on subsequent data .
