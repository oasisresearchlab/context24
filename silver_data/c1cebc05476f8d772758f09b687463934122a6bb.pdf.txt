Troy Littleton The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory , and Departments of Biology and Brain and Cognitive Sciences , Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge , Massachusetts 02139 Regulation of synaptic morphology depends on endocytosis of activated growth signal receptors , but the mechanisms regulating this membrane - trafficking event are unclear . Actin polymerization mediated by Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASp ) and the actin - relatedprotein2 / 3complexgeneratesforcesatmultiplestagesofendocytosis . FCH - BINamphiphysinRVS ( F - BAR ) / SH3domainproteins play key roles in this process by coordinating membrane deformation with WASp - dependent actin polymerization . However , it is not known how other WASp ligands , such as the small GTPase Cdc42 , coordinate with F - BAR / SH3 proteins to regulate actin polymerization at membranes . Nervous Wreck ( Nwk ) is a conserved neuronal F - BAR / SH3 protein that localizes to periactive zones at the Drosophila larvalneuromuscularjunction ( NMJ ) andisrequiredforregulationofsynapticgrowthviabonemorphogenicproteinsignaling . Here , we showthatNwkinteractswiththeendocyticproteinsdynaminandDap160andfunctionstogetherwithCdc42topromoteWASp - mediated actin polymerization in vitro and to regulate synaptic growth in vivo . Cdc42 function is associated with Rab11 - dependent recycling endosomes , and we show that Rab11 colocalizes with Nwk at the NMJ . Together , our results suggest that synaptic growth activated by growth factor signaling is controlled at an endosomal compartment via coordinated Nwk and Cdc42 - dependent actin assembly . Key words : actin ; endocytosis ; F - BAR ; Drosophila ; neuromuscular junction ; synaptic growth Introduction In response to changes in activity , neurons exhibit structural plasticity that contributes to long - lasting alterations in neuronal connectivity . However , the specific mechanisms by which activity - dependent cues are translated into morphological change remain unclear . The Drosophila neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) serves as a useful model for characterizing these signaling pathways . During larval development , the muscle surface area grows100 - fold , requiringelevatedsynapticinputtoachievemus - cle membrane depolarization . To maintain synaptic strength , synaptic arbors expand by adding new boutons , resulting in a stereotyped number of contacts per unit of muscle surface area . The mechanisms regulating this growth involve neuronal activ - ity , retrograde signals from the muscle , and anterograde signals from neuron to muscle ( Collins and Diantonio , 2007 ) . Mutations disrupting endocytosis , including endophilin , dap160 , bchs ( blue cheese ) , spict ( spichthyin ) , and rab11 ( Dickman et al . , 2006 ; Khodosh et al . , 2006 ; Wang et al . , 2007 ) , exhibit NMJ overgrowth , characterized by an excess of “satellite” boutons budding from axon terminal arbors . These proteins localize to - gether with growth - regulatory molecules to a domain called the periactive zone , which surrounds sites of synaptic vesicle release ( Roos and Kelly , 1999 ; Sone et al . , 2000 ) . It has been proposed that synaptic overgrowth in endocytosis mutants is attributable to a defect in the internalization and downregulation of signaling complexes driving synaptic growth ( Dickman et al . , 2006 ) . One likely signal transduction cascade whose activity may be modu - lated after endocytosis functions downstream of the TGF - (cid:1) / bone morphogenic protein ( BMP ) family member Glass Bottom Boat ( Gbb ) ( Marque´s and Zhang , 2006 ; Collins and Diantonio , 2007 ; O’Connor - Giles et al . , 2008 ) . However , the specific steps of en - docytosis in which receptor activation and downregulation occur have not been identified . Actin polymerization generates forces at multiple stages of endocytosis ( Kaksonen et al . , 2006 ) . Many endocytic accessory proteins tie actin polymerization to membrane traffic , but their precisefunctionsarenotunderstood . Rapidactinpolymerization depends on nucleation promoting factors , including the actin - related protein 2 / 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) complex . The Arp2 / 3 complex re - quires activation by the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASp ) family of proteins , which contain an autoinhibitory and GTPase - binding domain , an SH3 domain - binding proline - rich domain , and an Arp2 / 3 complex - activating verprolin - central - acidic ( VCA ) domain . Ligands such as the small GTPase Cdc42 and SH3 domain proteins release WASp autoinhibitory interac - tions , leading to Arp2 / 3 complex activation ( Stradal and Scita , 2006 ) .

Drosophila Nervous Wreck ( Nwk ) is a con - served F - BAR / SH3 domain protein . nwk mutants exhibit synap - tic overgrowth with excess satellite boutons reminiscent of endo - cytic mutants ( Coyle et al . , 2004 ) , and Nwk interacts physically and genetically with Wsp , the single Drosophila WASp homolog ( Ben - Yaacov et al . , 2001 ; Coyle et al . , 2004 ) . Recent evidence shows that Nwk might directly link BMP - signaling complexes to the endocytic machinery ( O’Connor - Giles et al . , 2008 ) . Here , we demonstrate that Nwk binds to endocytic proteins and directly controls Wsp / Arp2 / 3 actin polymerization via spe - cific SH3 domains . We show that Cdc42 cooperates with Nwk both in activating Wsp / Arp2 / 3 actin polymerization in vitro and in regulating synaptic growth in vivo . Cdc42 and Wsp function in recycling endosomes ( Parsons et al . , 2005 ; Balklava et al . , 2007 ) , and we find that the recycling endosome marker Rab11 colocal - izes with Nwk in periactive zones . Together , our results suggest that periactive zones are the synaptic equivalent of recycling en - dosomes , from which signals for synaptic growth are regulated by actin polymerization - dependent membrane traffic .

Results Synaptic overgrowth in nwk requires the Gbb cascade Nwk is required to constrain synaptic growth at the Drosophila larval NMJ ( Coyle et al . , 2004 ) , and members of the Nwk family regulate actin assembly tied to endocytosis , consistent with evidence that endocytosis may mediate downregulation of signals for synaptic growth ( Wang et al . , 2007 ) . The TGF - (cid:1) / BMP family member Gbb regulates synaptic growth through its receptors Wishful Thinking ( Wit ) , Thickveins ( Tkv ) , and Sax ( Saxophone ) , which are expressed in motor neurons ( Marque´s and Zhang , 2006 ) . We tested whether the activity of this signaling cascade was required for the synaptic overgrowth phenotype of nwk mutants , which is characterized by an increase in overall bouton number and satel - lite bouton formation . Mutations in Wit cause reduced synaptic growth at the NMJ ( Marque´s and Zhang , 2006 ) . The synaptic overgrowth phenotype of nwk mutants was completely sup - pressed by additional mutation of wit , and wit A12 / B11 , nwk 1 dou - ble mutants were not significantly different from wit A12 / B11 mu - tants ( Fig . 1 , supplemental Table 1a – c , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental material ) , indicating that the Gbb cascade is required for synaptic overgrowth in nwk . Similar results were obtained with gbb 1 / 2 ; nwk 2 double mutants ( data not shown ) . Thus , Nwk constrains synaptic growth by acting up - stream of synaptic growth signal output rather than by directly affecting the machinery that drives morphological changes in synaptic boutons . Nwk SH3 domains interact with the endocytic machinery We tested whether Nwk might regulate synaptic growth signals through interactions with the endocytic machinery . Members of the F - BAR / SH3 family of proteins function in endocytosis and bind to proline - rich regions in dynamin and WASp via their SH3 domains ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) , and Nwk requires Dap160 , the Drosophila homolog of the endocytic protein inter - sectin 1s , for proper localization to periactive zones ( Koh et al . , 2004 ) . GST - Nwk (cid:3) C immobilized on beads efficiently precipi - tated Dynamin , Dap160 , and Wsp ( Fig . 2 A ) from Drosophila head extracts . We generated point mutations in each Nwk SH3 domain [ W531A ( SH3a * ) and W677A ( SH3b * ) ] that are pre - dictedtoabolishbindingtoproline - richtargets ( Fazietal . , 2002 ) . GST pull - downs with these mutant proteins revealed that SH3a is required for Nwk - dynamin and Nwk – Wsp interactions and that SH3b is required for Nwk – Dap160 interactions ( Fig . 2 A ) . To determine whether Nwk SH3a interactions with Wsp and dynamin are mutually exclusive , we immunoprecipitated endog - enous dynamin complexes from wild - type and nwk mutant Dro - sophila headextracts . Dynaminantibodiesefficientlyprecipitated Nwk and Dap160 , but not Wsp ( Fig . 2 B ) , indicating that Nwk is predominantlyassociatedwithdynaminandthatthesedynamin - Nwk complexes lack Wsp . Thus , Nwk may switch interactions betweenWspanddynamin . AlthoughNwkbindstobothDap160 and to dynamin , dynamin – Dap160 interactions did not require Nwk ( Fig . 2 B ) . Dap160 contains only one predicted SH3 - binding site , which is located between its two EH domains . However , this region ( amino acids 1 – 287 ) was not sufficient for interactions between Dap160 and Nwk in the yeast two - hybrid assay . In contrast , the C terminus of Dap160 ( amino acids 259 – end ) interacted with Nwk inamannerthatdependedonNwk - SH3bintheyeasttwo - hybrid assay ( Fig . 2 C ) , recapitulating the results from GST pull - downs . Thus , Dap160 / Nwk - SH3b interactions do not depend on the sin - gle predicted SH3 - binding site in Dap160 but on another deter - minant in the C terminus .

Dap160 - SH3 bound specifically to Nwk (cid:3) C and Nwk (cid:3) C - SH3a * , but not Nwk (cid:3) C - SH3b * ( Fig . 2 D ) , recapitulat - ing the results from extracts ( Fig . 2 A ) . Because these binding reactions contained only purified proteins , and no predicted SH3 - binding site exists in the Dap160 C terminus , we hypothe - size that either Nwk - SH3b binds directly to a noncanonical SH3 - binding site in this region of Dap160 ( Duke - Cohan et al . , 2006 ) , or that Nwk - SH3b is required indirectly via intramolecular inter - actions within Nwk to reveal a binding site for Dap160 SH3 do - mains . In summary , our results show that Nwk interacts with components of the endocytic machinery via its SH3 domains ( Fig . 2 E ) , tying its function to membrane traffic . Nwk activates WASp - Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization Nwk interacts with Wsp ( Fig . 2 ) , which activates Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin polymerization to generate force for en - docytic events ( Kaksonen et al . , 2006 ) . To determine the effects of Nwk – Wsp interactions on the actin - nucleation activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex , we tested the effects of purified Nwk , Wsp , and Arp2 / 3 complex on the polymerization of actin . We purified a fragment of Wsp ( Wsp143 ) ( Fig . 3 A ) , which contains the Cdc42 - binding , proline - rich , and Arp2 / 3 - activating VCA domains of Wsp , retaining autoinhibitory interactions between its N and C termini ( Co et al . , 2007 ) .

We next tested the role of each Nwk SH3 domain in activation of Wsp . Nwk (cid:3) C - SH3b * acti - vated Wsp143 identically to wild - type Nwk (cid:3) C , consistent with biochemical in - teractions showing that Nwk - SH3a medi - ates Wsp - Nwk associations . Nwk (cid:3) C - SH3a * was unable to stimulate Wsp143 / Arp2 / 3 and in fact uncovered an inhibitory effect for Nwk on Wsp / Arp2 / 3 complex . Nwk (cid:3) C - SH3a * had no inhibitory effect on Wsp - VCA domain ( nonautoinhibited ) ac - tivation of the Arp2 / 3 complex , suggesting that inhibition was mediated through the proline - rich region of Wsp143 ( Fig . 3 C ) . The inhibitory effect of Nwk (cid:3) C - SH3a * was mainly relieved by additionally mutat - ing Nwk - SH3b ( Fig . 3 C ) , suggesting that the SH3b domain mediates the negative regulatory function and that ligands of SH3b could relieve negative regulation of Nwk - Wsp activation . These results are consistent with SH3b acting directly on the proline - rich region of Wsp because our ac - tin polymerization assays contain only pu - rified components , although SH3b is not sufficient for precipitation of Wsp from Drosophila extracts ( Fig . 2 A ) . This may re - flect a low affinity interaction between SH3b and Wsp , or competing SH3b or Wsp proline - rich domain ligands in extracts . Wsp contains one predicted Nwk SH3a - binding site and three predicted Nwk SH3b - binding sites ( Fer - raro et al . , 2007 ) . One SH3b - binding site overlaps with the SH3a binding site , suggesting that SH3b could prevent activation of Wsp by reducing conformational change in the specific region of Wsp that is required for activation through SH3a . In summary , our biochemical analysis indicates that Nwk - SH3a directly acti - vates Wsp - dependent actin polymerization and that Nwk - SH3b ligands may regulate this activation process . Nwk function in vivo depends on SH3 domain interactions To test the role of Nwk SH3 domains on its in vivo function , we expressed full - length Nwk transgenes containing SH3 point mu - tantsina nwk nullbackground ( Fig . 4 A ) . Overexpressionofwild - type Nwk does not affect synaptic growth ( see below ) . Nwk mu - tant transgenes localized to synaptic boutons in a similar pattern [ “periactive zones , ” surrounding the active zone marker Bruch - pilot ( Brp ) ] to wild - type Nwk ( Fig . 4 B ) , although the Nwk - SH3a * b * double mutant appeared somewhat more diffuse . The predominant phenotype of nwk mutants is an increase in overall bouton number . We quantified this phenotype in transgenic res - cue animals and found that Nwk - SH3a * and Nwk - SH3b * failed to restore normal synaptic growth , whereas a transgene contain - ing a deletion of the Nwk C terminus rescued synaptic over - growth as well as full - length Nwk ( Fig . 5 A , B , supplemental Table 1d , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental material ) . In - terestingly , the Nwk - SH3a * b * double mutant exhibited more se - vere synaptic overgrowth than the nwk null mutant or the SH3 domain single mutants , suggesting that the SH3 domains have overlapping functions and that the Nwk - SH3a * b * double mutant protein actively impairs synaptic growth regulation rather than merely phenocopying the absence of Nwk . We then tested whether Nwk transgenes could exhibit domi - nant phenotypes in an otherwise wild - type background . Overex - pression of Nwk - SH3b * but not Nwk SH3a * resulted in signifi - cant synaptic overgrowth in a wild - type background ( Fig . 6 A , B , supplemental Table 1e , available at www . jneurosci . org as supple - mental material ) . To test whether this dominant - negative effect reflects our in vitro observations that Nwk - SH3b negatively reg - ulates Wsp , leading to spurious activation of Wsp by Nwk - SH3a in the absence of input from its SH3b domain ligands , we tested whether additional mutation of SH3a could suppress the domi - nant phenotype of Nwk - SH3b * . Instead , we found that the Nwk - SH3a * b * double mutant still exhibited synaptic overgrowth , sug - gesting that the dominant effect is mediated by a non - SH3a ligand of Nwk . In summary , both SH3 domains of Nwk are re - quired in vivo for normal regulation of synaptic growth and have both separate and overlapping functions . Nwk cooperates with Cdc42 in vitro and in vivo SH3 domain proteins such as Nck activate mammalian WASp very strongly , with a half - maximal concentration of (cid:5) 50 n M ( Tomasevic et al . , 2007 ) . However , Nwk only activates Wsp weakly , with a half - maximal concentration of (cid:5) 300 n M ( see be - low ) . We therefore tested whether Nwk could act together with another prominent Wsp activator , the small GTPase Cdc42 , to achieve more robust Arp2 / 3 stimulation . Both purified activated Cdc42 and Nwk were able to partially stimulate Wsp - dependent actin polymerization when added alone ( Fig . 7 A ) . When com - bined , Cdc42 acted together with Nwk (cid:3) C to stimulate Wsp143 in the pyrene - actin polymerization assay ( Fig . 7 A ) , even at saturat - ing concentrations of Nwk ( Fig . 7 B ) . Thus , inputs from both Figure 4 . Expression of Nwk SH3 domain mutants in vivo . A , Immunoblots of Drosophila head extracts expressing Nwk transgenes . Cpx serves as a loading control .

We analyzed the localization of Cdc42 at the Drosophila larval NMJ . Myc - tagged Cdc42 , which complements the shared func - tionofNwkandCdc42 ( seebelow ) , localizedtosmallpresynaptic and postsynaptic puncta ( Fig . 8 A ) . Nwk localizes presynaptically at the NMJ in a honeycomb pattern that surrounds active zones ( Coyle et al . , 2004 ) . Other proteins sharing this localization func - tion in endocytosis and synaptic growth ( Roos and Kelly , 1999 ; Sone et al . , 2000 ) . The presynaptic component of Cdc42 over - lapped with Nwk localization in periactive zones ( Fig . 8 A ) . Re - cent work in Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian cell culture indicates that Cdc42 functions in intracellular endosomal mem - brane traffic ( Parsons et al . , 2005 ; Balklava et al . , 2007 ) . Rab11 functions in recycling endosomes and rab11 mutants exhibit a large increase in satellite boutons at the Drosophila NMJ ( Kho - dosh et al . , 2006 ) . Therefore , Nwk and Cdc42 may regulate syn - aptic growth at the actin - membrane interface of recycling endo - somes . Rab11 localized in a very similar pattern to Cdc42 , although it was difficult to conclusively determine the extent of colocalization of Cdc42 with Rab11 at the level of light micros - copy because of the small size and abun - dance of the puncta . However , Rab11 puncta exhibited a striking colocalization with Nwk in periactive zones ( Fig . 8 B ) . TheseresultssuggestthatNwkfunctionsinaRab11 - positive compartment , in which Cdc42 has previously been shown to act , and that the periactive zone may be the synaptic equivalent of the recycling endosome . Nwk interacts with components of the endocytic machinery , but the synaptic growth phenotype of nwk mutants are not as severe as that of endocytic mutants such as shibire ( shi ) / dynamin and dap160 ( Dickman et al . , 2006 ) . We hypothesized that in nwk mutants , Cdc42 activation of Wsp may partially compensate for the ab - sence of Nwk . The function of Cdc42 at the Drosophila NMJ has not been previously characterized . Dominant - negative and constitutively active alleles of Cdc42 cause axon targeting defects ( Luo et al . , 1994 ) , complicating analysis of their effects on NMJ growth . Therefore , we analyzed loss - of - function alleles of CDC42 , which do not exhibit targeting defects ( Genova et al . , 2000 ) . Unlike more severe alleles of CDC42 , the mild hypomorphic allele cdc42 2 gives rise to viable third instar larvae ( Fehon et al . , 1997 ) . To test whether Cdc42 and Nwk have overlapping roles at the lar - val NMJ , we generated cdc42 2 ; nwk double mutants . cdc42 2 exhibited a significant in - crease in bouton number and satellite bou - ton number relative to wild - type controls , and cdc42 2 ; nwk double mutants showed an additive effect on synaptic growth with double the number of satellite boutons compared with each single mutant ( Fig . 8 C – E , supplemental Table 1f – h , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental ma - terial ) . This phenotype was recapitulated using an independent null allele of nwk and rescued by an myc epitope - tagged CDC42 transgene , confirming that the effects were specific to Cdc42 and Nwk ( Fig . 8 C – E , supplemental Table S1f – h , available at www . jneurosci . org as supplemental material ) . Because cdc42 2 is an ex - tremely mild hypomorphic allele , these results are likely to un - derestimate the actual contribution of Cdc42 to synaptic growth . We conclude that Cdc42 and Nwk cooperate in vitro to control actin polymerization by Wsp and in vivo to regulate synaptic growth , suggesting that converging signals from SH3 domains and Cdc42 control Wsp activity at the synapse . Discussion Our findings demonstrate that the conserved F - BAR / SH3 pro - tein Nwk interacts with the endocytic machinery and activates Wsp / Arp2 / 3 actin polymerization together with Cdc42 to regu - late synaptic growth upstream of growth factor signaling . Map - ping these interactions and activities provides a critical frame - work for determining the mechanism by which endocytic accessory proteins and the cytoskeleton control membrane de - formation during endocytosis .

Neurosci . , August13 , 2008 • 28 ( 33 ) : 8316 – 8325 • 8321 Nwk activates Wsp / Arp2 / 3 actin polymerization via its SH3a domain , and Nwk - SH3b is not required for Wsp binding or ac - tivation , but is required for the residual Wsp - inhibitory activity of Nwk when SH3a function is abolished . This activity may be more pronounced on endogenous Wsp , which is more tightly autoinhibited than recombinant WASp ( Ho et al . , 2004 ) , raising the possibility that Nwk - SH3b could potently regulate Nwk - SH3a - dependent activation of Wsp . Thus , ligands of Nwk - SH3b are in a position to serve as activators of Nwk and Wsp / Arp2 / 3 actin polymerization . Nwk - SH3b is required for interactions be - tween Nwk and Dap160 , which is an excellent candidate for act - ing upstream of Nwk , because dap160 mutants exhibit synaptic overgrowth and temperature - sensitive seizures like those of nwk mutants , and Nwk is mislocalized in dap160 NMJs ( Koh et al . , 2004 ; Marie et al . , 2004 ) . Recently , it was reported that the frag - ment of Dap160 containing its last two SH3 domains is required for interaction with full - length Nwk in Drosophila extracts , lead - ing to the hypothesis that the C terminal proline - rich region of Nwk mediates these interactions ( O’Connor - Giles et al . , 2008 ) . Our results show instead that interactions between purified Nwk (cid:3) C ( i . e . , Nwk lacking the C terminus ) and both endogenous full - length Dap160 as well as purified Dap160 SH3 domain - containing fragment depend on Nwk SH3b . Two possible inter - pretations can reconcile these results . Nwk SH3b may interact with a noncanonical SH3 domain - binding site in the intervening sequences between the Dap160 SH3 domains ( Duke - Cohan et al . , 2006 ) . Alternatively , Nwk SH3b may function in an intramo - lecular interaction within Nwk that is required to expose one of several proline - rich sequences in the N - terminal region Nwk for interaction with Dap160 SH3 domains . Thus , we conclude that Nwk SH3b is important for Dap160 – Nwk interactions via an indirect or noncanonical mechanism . Further experiments will be needed to identify the Nwk - binding site on Dap160 and to confirm activity of Dap160 on Nwk in vitro . Nwk - SH3a is required for interactions of Nwk with both dy - Figure6 . Dominantphenotypesofmutant NWK transgenes .

Neurosci . , August13 , 2008 • 28 ( 33 ) : 8316 – 8325 Rodaletal . • EndocyticActinAssemblyinSynapticGrowth namin and Wsp . Other F - BAR / SH3 family members have been postulated to link dynamin and Wsp by multimerization via their F - BAR domains ( Itoh and De Camilli , 2006 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ; Shimada et al . , 2007 ) , but endogenous complexes containing Wsp and dynamin have only been demonstrated for the F - BAR / SH3 protein syndapin ( Kessels and Qualmann , 2006 ) . Nwk could thus be in a position to bring dynamin and Wsp together . We have not been able to coimmunoprecipi - tate endogenous Wsp and Nwk using our antibodies . However , we find that dy - namin immunoprecipitates contain Nwk but not Wsp , suggesting that Nwk - SH3a may switch associations between dynamin and Wsp . Another interpretation is that Wsp and dynamin binding are restricted to separate populations of Nwk molecules , and that the SH3a domain thus acts in two parallel biochemical pathways . In vivo analysis reflects the complexity of these SH3 domain interactions . SH3a and SH3b of Nwk have both separate and overlapping functions in regulating synap - tic growth ( Figs . 5 , 6 ) , perhaps reflecting the multivalent nature of interactions in the Nwk network . [ In addition to binding Nwk , Dap160 binds to both dynamin ( Roos et al . , 1998 ) and to Wsp ( Giot et al . , 2003 ) . ] Furthermore , the fact that muta - tion of both SH3 domains together ( Nwk - SH3a * b * ) produces additional dominant effects suggests that a non - SH3 ligand of Nwk is inappropriately titrated away from its function after mutation of Nwk SH3 domains . An excellent candidate ligand is the membrane itself , because the Nwk F - BAR domain has the potential to bind to and tubulate phospholipid bilayers . Deter - mining the specific order and regulation of F - BAR / SH3 domain protein interactions with competing SH3 domain ligands and with the membrane will be important for uncovering the molecular mechanisms of these proteins during endocytosis . NMJ overgrowth with an excess of sat - ellite boutons is a hallmark of endocytic mutants ( Dickman et al . , 2006 ) . We show that Nwk interacts with the endocytic ma - chinery and that cdc42 and nwk mutants exhibit overproliferation of satellite bou - tons . A prominent function of endocytosis in nerve terminals is the recycling of syn - aptic vesicles . However , nwk single mu - tants ( Coyle et al . , 2004 ) and cdc42 ; nwk double mutants ( S . Saraswati , A . A . Rodal , and J . T . Littleton , unpublished results ) show no detectable defect in endocytosis of synapticvesicles . Oneinterpretationofthis result is that receptor endocytosis is more sensitivetoperturbationthansynapticves - icle recycling . However , given the docu - mented function of Cdc42 and Wsp in en - dosomes ( see below ) , it is more likely that Nwk functions in a later step of endocytic traffic . Importantly , although the synaptic vesicle endocytosis de - fects in shi ( dynamin ) and dap160 reflect the function of these mol - eculesintheinternalizationstepofendocytosis , synapticovergrowth in these mutants could arise from defects at later steps of endocytic traffic , because dynamin functions in a variety of membrane - trafficking events , ranging from Golgi traffic to endosome traffic ( van Dam and Stoorvogel , 2002 ; Kessels et al . , 2006 ) .

Neurosci . , August13 , 2008 • 28 ( 33 ) : 8316 – 8325 • 8323 The endosomal system is organized into subdomains de - fined by specific members of the Rab GTPase family and adopts distinct morphology and ultrastructure in different cell types . Thus , functionally conserved Rab subdomains provide a unifying approach to understanding structurally diverse membrane systems . Rab11 controls the function of the recy - cling endosome in directing traffic to the cell surface ( So¨n - nichsen et al . , 2000 ) and colocalizes with Nwk in periactive zones at the Drosophila NMJ [ although it can occasionally be observed in larger puncta ( Khodosh et al . , 2006 ) ] . Like cdc42 and nwk mutants , rab11 mutants have a profound defect in synaptic growth , exhibiting excessive satellite boutons ( Kho - dosh et al . , 2006 ) . Cdc42 and WASp have recently been impli - cated in recycling endosome function ( Parsons et al . , 2005 ; Balklava et al . , 2007 ) . Thus , periactive zones may be the syn - aptic representation of the recycling endosome , with Cdc42 and Nwk controlling actin polymerization - dependent traffic of signaling complexes at this Rab11 - positive compartment . Whether Cdc42 functions as a signal - responsive element in this compartment or forms part of the constitutive machinery for membrane traffic remains uncertain . The TGF - (cid:1) / BMP family member Gbb ( Marque´s and Zhang , 2006 ; Collins and Diantonio , 2007 ) activates downstream signals that may be the critical targets of Nwk / Cdc42 - mediated endocy - tosis in synaptic growth ( Fig . 1 ) . Indeed , recent work has shown that Gbb signaling is required for synaptic overgrowth in nwk mutants , phosphorylation of the Gbb signaling target Mothers against decapentaplegic ( Mad ) is upregulated in nwk mutants , and Nwk biochemically interacts with the intracellular domain of the Gbb receptor Tkv ( O’Connor - Giles et al . , 2008 ) . However , other signaling pathways could equally be regulated by Nwk / Cdc42 - mediated endocytosis , lead to upregulation of phosphor - ylated Mad , and contribute to the synaptic overgrowth in cdc42 ; nwk mutants . One candidate pathway is the presynaptic compo - nent of the Wnt / Wg cascade , which may converge on Gbb / Mad regulation in the synapse as observed in other tissues ( Fuentealba et al . , 2007 ) . We have not been able to detect any change in the steady - state localization of candidate cargoes in synaptic boutons in nwk or cdc42 mutants , suggesting that Nwk and Cdc42 are not required for the gross morphology of endosomes , but instead contribute to the rate of cargo trafficking through this compart - ment . Determining the specific signaling pathways , receptors , and their activation states in recycling endosomes will require tools to measure the activity and rates of traffic of specific recep - tors in situ . Nwk is conserved from insects to higher vertebrates , and the mammalian genome encodes two Nwk homologs , which have not yet been characterized . However , Cdc42 and WASp - induced actin polymerization have been implicated in synapse formation in Aplysia sensory neurons and in mammalian hippocampal cul - tures ( Udo et al . , 2005 ; Shen et al . , 2006 ) . These reports suggest that the direct consequence of activating these proteins was the formation of filopodia that mature into synapses . An alternative hypothesis , consistent with the established function of Cdc42 and WASpfamilymembersingeneratingforceforintracellularmem - brane traffic rather than in filopodial formation ( Qualmann and Kessels , 2002 ; Biyasheva et al . , 2004 ; Faix and Rottner , 2006 ; Kak - sonen et al . , 2006 ) , is that synaptic growth regulatory functions of Cdc42 and WASp depend on endosomal traffic of signaling com - plexes by a similar mechanism to Drosophila Nwk - Wsp - induced synapse formation .
