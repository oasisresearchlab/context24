Jorgensen 1 Ultrafast endocytosis can retrieve a single , large endocytic vesicle as fast as 50 – 100 ms after synaptic vesicle fusion . However , the fate of the large endocytic vesicles is not known . Here we demonstrate that these vesicles transition to a synaptic endosome about one second after stimulation . The endosome is resolved into coated vesicles after 3 s , which in turn becomesmall - diametersynapticvesicles5 – 6safterstimulation .

Ultrafastendocytosisfailswhenactinpolymerizationisdisrupted , orwhenneuronsarestimulatedatroom temperature instead of physiological temperature . In the absence of ultrafast endocytosis , synaptic vesicles are retrieved directly from the plasma membrane by clathrin - mediated endocytosis . These results may explain discrepancies among published experiments concerning the role of clathrin in synaptic vesicle endocytosis . Clathrinisthoughttoactattheplasmamembraneofsynapsestoretrievesynapticvesiclemembraneandproteins . There is anextensiveliterature supportingthisconclusion . Classicultrastructuralstudiesoffrogneuro - muscular junctions revealed the presence of clathrin coats on the plas - ma membrane after stimulation , suggesting that synaptic vesicles are reconstitutedatthesurface 1 . Biochemicalpurificationofclathrin - coated vesicles from rat brain demonstrated that synaptic vesicle proteins co - purifywithclathrinandAP2 ( ref . 2 ) , andAP2andclathrinaresufficient to generate vesicles from purified brain lipids 3 , 4 . Transmembrane ves - icle proteins , such as synaptotagmin 5 – 7 and synaptrobrevin 8 , 9 , interact with adaptor proteins at the plasma membrane and these interactions are required for regenerating functional synaptic vesicles . These studies lend strong support to the idea that clathrin acts at the plasma mem - brane to regenerate functional synaptic vesicles . However , recent mor - phologicalstudies 10 , 11 suggestthatendocytosismay bemuch faster than previously described for clathrin - mediated endocytosis . ‘Flash - and - freeze’ fixation combines optogenetic stimulation with high - pressure freezing to capture events at synapses milliseconds after stimulation . Our ultrastructural studies demonstrated that endocytic pits , which lacked stereotypical clathrin coats , appeared , 50 ms after stimulation at both Caenorhabditis elegans 11 and mouse synapses 10 . Ultrafast endocytosis is compensatory , that is , membrane retrieval is triggered by the membrane added by fusion 10 . Under our stimulation conditions this appears to be due to multiquantal release 10 , as has been previouslyobservedatculturedhippocampalsynapses 12 . Thelargeendo - cytic vesicles retrieved by ultrafast endocytosis are too big to be func - tionalsynapticvesicles—theyaretypicallyequivalenttothesurfaceareaof4synapticvesicles—andthefateofthesevesicleswasunknown . Here we examined events that occur up to 20s after stimulation . We performed ‘flash - and - freeze’ experiments on mouse hippocampal neu - ronsandanalysedthesynapticultrastructureblindfrom , 200synaptic profilespertimepoint . Atotalof10 , 514synapticprofilesand361tomo - grams were analysed . We applied a single stimulus in the presence of 4 mM Ca 2 1 or 10 stimuli ( 20Hz ) in the presence of 2 mM Ca 2 1 . At physiologicaltemperatures ( 34 – 37 u C ) , clathrinisnotrequiredforultra - fast endocytosis but is required to bud synaptic vesicles from synaptic endosomes ( Extended Data Fig . 1 ) . However , at room temperature ( , 22 u C ) , clathrin functions at the plasma membrane during endocytosis . Synaptic vesicles reform from endosomes Clathrin polyhedral coats on endocytic membranes are distinctive in electron micrographs ( Fig . 1 and Extended Data Fig . 2 ) . Inour prepara - tions , these coats are observed on pits on the cell body ( Extended Data Fig . 2d ) but rarely observed on the plasma membrane at synapses . To test the requirement of clathrin after stimulation , a single stimulus was applied to hippocampal cells expressing a variant of channelrhodopsin ( ChetaTC ) 13 . Theexperimentswereperformedinthepresenceof4mM Ca 2 1 intheexternalsolutionat34 u C ( Fig . 1 ) and37 u C ( ExtendedData Fig . 2 ) . Afterasinglestimulus , endocyticpitsthatlackdistinctiveclathrin coats formed 50 – 100ms after fusion ( Fig . 1a , left panel ; Extended Data Fig . 2a , leftpanel ) 10 .

Tomo - graphic reconstructions ofthese endosomes demonstrated that they are notconnectedtotheplasmamembrane ( ExtendedDataFig . 2candSup - plementary Video 1 ) . Clathrin - like coats were visible on some of these endosomes ( Fig . 1b , c and ExtendedData Fig . 2b – d ) , andbudded endo - somespeaked3safterstimulation ( Fig . 1c , dandExtendedDataFig . 2b , c , e ) . The decline in endosomes was accompanied by an accumulation ofclathrin - coatedvesiclesinsidetheboutonat3s ( Fig . 1dandExtended Data Fig . 2e , f ) . By contrast , clathrin - coated pits on the plasma mem - brane were only observed in 0 . 4 % of synaptic profiles ( 4 / 907 ) between 1 to 10s after stimulation ( 1s ( 2 / 332 ) ; 3 s ( 2 / 345 ) ; 10s ( 0 / 330 ) ) ( Fig . 1d and ExtendedDataFig . 2e ) .

Clathrin not required for endocytosis Totest the role of clathrin inultrafastendocytosis , wereduced express - ionofclathrinusingRNAi 15 .

Clathrinwassignificantlyreduced seven days after infectionas determined by western blot ( , 80 % reduc - tion , n 5 3 ; ExtendedDataFig . 4a ) andimmunostaining ( 64 % reduction ; Extended Data Fig . 4b , d , e ) . Similarly , transferrin uptake was reduced by 66 % ( Extended Data Fig . 4c , f ) . Clathrinknockdown reduced release - readyvesiclesbutdidnotaffecttheexocyticmachineryinelectrophysio - logical recordings ( Fig . 2a , Extended Data Fig . 5a – f , seeSupplementary Information ) . Likewise , a smaller docked pool of vesicles was observed by electron microscopy , but the overall morphology of synapses was nor - mal ( Extended Data Fig . 5g , h , see Supplementary Information ) . Clathrin knockdown did not disrupt ultrafast endocytosis , which remained proportional to vesicle fusion . Following a single stimulus ( 34 u C , 4mMCa 2 1 ) , endocyticpitsandlargeendocyticvesiclesappeared at the edges of the active zone both in the control and clathrin knock - down cells ( Fig . 2b , c ) . The number of endocytic pits and vesicles was decreasedby41 % ( Fig . 2c ) , closelymatchingthereductioninexocytosis of synaptic vesicles ( Extended Data Fig . 5h ) . These results suggest that membrane retrieval via ultrafast endocytosis does not depend on cla - thrin , which is consistent with the lack of stereotypic clathrin coats on pits during ultrafast endocytosis ( Fig . 1a and Extended Data Fig . 2a ) . Clathrin regenerates vesicles at endosomes To determine whether clathrin is required to resolve endosomes into synaptic vesicles , control and clathrin knockdown cells were stimulated inthepresenceofcationizedferritin ( 4mMCa 2 1 , 34 u C ) . Cationizedfer - ritin adheres to membranes and serves as a fluid phase marker for endo - cytictrafficking . Incontrolcultures1safterasinglestimulus ( Fig . 3a , b ) , ferritin molecules were found in endosomes but not in clathrin - coated vesicles . At3s , endosomeswerebuddingandferritinbegantoappearin clathrin - coated vesicles . The size of endosomes was larger than endocy - ticvesicles , againsuggestingthatendocyticvesiclescarryingferritinfuse toformsynapticendosomes ( ExtendedDataFig . 3b , c ) .

Some clathrin - coated vesicles were observed before 3 s after stimulation ( 1 s , 4 / 149 synaptic profiles and Fig . 1d ) , but they did not containferritinmolecules , suggestingthattheywerederivedfrompre - existing endosomes .

All rights reserved ©2014 In clathrin knockdown cultures , ferritin - filled endosomes increased after 1 s ( Fig . 3d ) . However , these endosomesdidnotdeclineacrossthe 3 s , 10s or 20s ( Fig . 3c , d ) . These endosomes formed almost no coated buds and remained spherical ( Fig . 3c ) , suggesting that membrane curv - ature of the buds requires clathrin . Together , these results suggest that clathrin is required at endosomes to regenerate synaptic vesicles fol - lowing a single stimulus . Clathrin at endosomes after 10 stimuli At mammaliancentral synapses , action potentials often fire in bursts 16 , 17 andcouldexhaustultrafastendocytosis . Toassayendocytosisafterhigh - frequencystimulation , wedelivered10stimuli ( 20Hzfor500msin2mM Ca 2 1 , 34 u C ) and frozecultures1 s , 3s , 10s , and20s aftertheendofthe stimulus . Under these conditions , 90 % of the cells fired action poten - tials for all 10 light pulses ( Extended Data Fig . 7a ) . Using cationized ferritin , we followed the fate of the newly endocytosed vesicles ( Fig . 4 and Extended Data Fig . 3d , e ) . The results were similar to those after a singlestimulus . Coatedpitswerenotobservedontheplasmamembrane . Ferritinaccumulationinendosomespeakedat1s ; endosomesexhibited coated buds at 3 s , accompanied by the appearance of clathrin - coated vesiclesandsomeuncoatedsynapticvesicles . Allvesicleswereuncoated by 10s ( Fig . 4a , b and Extended Data Fig . 7b ) . Ferritin - filled vesicles were eventually recruited to the active zone , suggesting that these vesi - cles are probably synaptic vesicles ( Extended Data Fig . 7c ) . We then applied an identical 20 Hz stimulation to cultures treated with clathrin shRNA . In these cultures ferritin was taken up into large endosomes , againsuggestingthatmembraneinternalizationafterahigh frequency burst does not require clathrin ( Fig . 4c ) . However , ferritin - containing endosomes were abundant and were not resolved into vesi - cles even after 20s ( Fig . 4c , d ) , indicating that clathrin is essential for regenerating vesiclesfromendosomesafter a burstof actionpotentials . The acuteinhibition ofclathrinfunctionbyPitstop2 , a potent inhibitor of clathrin - mediated endocytosis , ( 30 m M , 2 min ) also blocked regen - eration of synaptic vesicles from endosomes ( Extended Data Fig . 8 ; see SupplementaryInformation ) . Theseresultssuggestthatfollowingashort burst of action potentials , clathrin acts on endosomes to regenerate syn - aptic vesicles . To determine whether intense stimulation triggers clathrin - mediated endocytosis , we applied trains of 3 , 10 , 30 , and 100light pulses at 20Hz to hippocampal neurons and froze them 10 s after stimulation ( 2mM Ca 2 1 , 34 u C ) .

After dynasore treatment , noclathrin - coatedpitsweretrappedontheplasmamembrane underanycondition . Instead , stringsofuncoatedvesiclesattachedtothe plasma membrane accumulated at the edges of active zones ( Fig . 4e , f ) . The diameter of vesicles in strings ( 53 . 3 6 3 . 7nm ) was larger than syn - apticvesicles ( , 40nm ) butsmallerthanlargeendocyticvesiclesformed afterasinglestimulus ( , 80nm ) , reflectingreducedfusionduringrepet - itivestimulation . Theseresultssuggestultrafastendocytosisisresponsible for removing membrane from the surface even during high frequency bursts of action potentials and that clathrin functions on endosomes rather than at the plasma membrane to regenerate synaptic vesicles . Ultrafast pathway is temperature sensitive Actin polymerization is required for ultrafast endocytosis 10 . To study synaptic vesicle recycling in the absence of ultrafast endocytosis , we blocked actin polymerization . We treated cultured neurons with 10 m M latrunculin - Afor30s , stimulatedoncebya10mslightflash , andfrozen 3 or 10s later ( 4mM Ca 2 1 , 34 u C ) .

The number of clathrin - coatedvesicles is less than expectedgiven that endosomes contain 5 – 8 synaptic vesicles worth of membrane . This discrepancy is probably because synaptic vesicles will be distributed among many thin sections . d , In the clathrin knockdown , ferritin stalled in endosomes and did not progress into synaptic vesicles . Clathrin - coated pits were not present on the plasma membrane at any time point and are therefore not plotted . The standard error of the mean is shown in each graph .

All rights reserved ©2014 Likeinthelatrunculin - Atreatedcells , largevesicles , possiblyendosomes , accumulated in the centre of the bouton 10 s after stimulation 22 , 23 , as observed previously in hippocampal cultures stimulated at room tem - perature 22 , 23 . The diameter of coated pits and synaptic vesicles were similar ( Extended Data Fig . 9b ) . These results suggest that failure of ultrafast endocytosis leads to clathrin - mediated endocytosis on the plasma membrane . Temperature In classic electron microscopy studies of stimulated synapses , clathrin - mediatedendocytosisoccursabout20safterstimulation 24 , 25 . Bycontrast , clathrin - independent ultrafast endocytosis removes excess membrane 30 – 100msafterstimulation 10 , 11 , andasdemonstratedhere , synapticvesi - cles areregenerated via anendosome5 – 6s afterstimulation ( Extended Data Fig . 1 ) . These contradictory results can be reconciled simply by considering temperature . Ultrafastendocytosisisonlyobservedatphysiologicaltemperatures . When neurons are cooled to 22 u C , ultrafast endocytosis fails , and the slower clathrin - mediated process takes over . Actin polymerization is greatly reduced in cultured cells at non - physiological temperature 26 , 27 . Because ultrafast endocytosis requires actin polymerization , it is prob - able that vesicle components accumulate on the plasma membrane at roomtemperature , andtheclathrinmachineryisrecruitedtotheplasma membrane instead of the synaptic endosome . The shift to clathrin - mediatedendocytosismaycontributetorapidsynapticdepressionthatisobservedatroomtemperature 28 , 29 , perhapsbecauseexcessmembrane in the active zone could block exocytosis . Previous ultrastructural data have suggested the presence of a fast form of endocytosis at physiological temperature . When frog pectoral muscleswerestimulatedat10 u CintheoriginalHeuserandReeseexperi - ments , clathrin - coated pits accumulated on the plasma membrane 1 ; whereas when stimulated at room temperature , two forms of endocy - tosiswereobserved : afastform1safterstimulation , andaslowform20s after stimulation 24 . At snake neuromuscular junctions , clathrin - coated pits accumulated when stimulated at 7 u C 30 , whereas at room temper - ature , membrane was retrieved in 1 – 2s 31 . In rat hippocampal neurons , endosomes ( . 70nm ) were observedafter stimulation atphysiological temperature but not at room temperature 32 . Capacitance studies also indicate fast and slow mechanisms . In the calyx of Held , fast endocy - tosis was observed at physiological temperature ( 35 – 37 u C ) , but was abolished at room temperature 33 . Fast endocytosis was also observed infishretinalbipolarcells , membranewasrecovered , 1 safterasingle stimulation 34 , 35 . Ultrastructure and capacitance analyses only measure membrane endocytosis ; protein endocytosis can be measured by pHluorin assays . At room temperature , a slow form of endocytosis is observed in hip - pocampal neurons with a surface dwell time of 15 s 36 . When pHluorin experiments are conducted at physiological temperatures , the time constant for endocytosis is significantly faster : 14 s at 24 u C and 10 s at 30 u C , and as fast as 6 s at 37 u C 37 , 38 . At first glance , a 6 s recovery for vesicleproteinsagreeswellwitha6srecoveryofmorphologicallydefinedsynapticvesicles . However , suchacomparisonisdeceptive , asitisunlikely that proteins in a fusing vesicle could diffuse to the lateral edge of the active zone and into an endocytic vesicle within 50ms . Nevertheless , temperature seems to be responsible for differences observed among ultrastructural studies . Clathrin at endosomes Endosomesaresortingcompartmentsthatreceivecargofromtransport vesicles generated by endocytosis from the plasma membrane . Heuser andReeseproposedintheiroriginalmodelthatclathrin - mediatedendo - cytosisgeneratedatransportvesiclethatfusedtoanendosome ( ‘cisterna’ ) , and synaptic vesicles were then regenerated from these endosomes 1 . However , subsequent experiments demonstrated that these cisternae were likely to arise via bulk endocytosis due to non - physiological stimu - lation 25 , and the model was amended to propose that synaptic vesicles weregenerateddirectlyfromtheplasmamembraneviaclathrin - mediated endocytosis , whereasbulkendocytosisremovedexcessmembraneadded during intense stimulation . Thus , the cisternae do not represent true endosomes as they do not arise via transport vesicles but rather from a simple pinching off from the plasma membrane . Moreover , it was ob - served that internal clathrin - coated buds were often , or even always , attachedtotheplasmamembranevialong tubules 1 , 4 , 39 , whichledtothe idea that the formation of clathrin - coated pits is limited to the plasma membrane . Thedifferent lipidcompositionsofendosomesandtheplas - ma membrane support this notion . Endosomes are enriched for phos - phatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( PI ( 3 ) P ) , whereas the plasma membrane is enriched in phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) and therefore can recruit clathrin – AP2 ( ref . 40 ) . By contrast , our data suggest that clathrin regenerates synaptic vesi - clesfromasynapticendosomeratherthanfromthesurface . Tomographic reconstructions of endosomes failed to identify connecting tubules to the plasma membrane . Moreover , these compartments appear to be trueendosomes , inthattheyaregeneratedbytransportvesicles . Because endosomes are twice as large as endocytic vesicles , the synaptic endo - someprobablyformsbyfusionofendocyticvesicles . Thesynapticendo - some is resolved into synaptic vesicles by clathrin - mediated budding , and for this reason it is unlikely that synaptic endosome are typical endo - somes . The presence of clathrin on these endosomes suggests they are enriched in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . In this case , the membrane composition of ‘syn - aptic endosomes’ is more like the plasma membrane than that of clas - sical endosomes . A growing body of molecular studies support the conclusion that syn - aptic vesicles may be regenerated from endosomes . Live imaging in hip - pocampal neurons indicates that recently endocytosed vesicle proteins are sorted in an endosomeafter stimulation 22 . Endosomal Rab GTPases , such as Rab5 and Rab35 , are abundant at the synapse and can be co - purified with synaptic vesicles 41 , and inhibition of Rab5 ( ref . 42 ) and skywalker 43 ( required for Rab35 function ) results in an accumulation of endosomes insynaptic boutons . Finally , accumulation of endosomes is also observed in the absence of AP2 , clathrin , clathrin accessory proteins or dynamin 44 – 48 . In summary , our results resolve an important contradiction : most studies indicate that clathrin is essential for endocytosis at hippocam - pal synapses 36 , whereas ultrafast endocytosis is clathrin - independent . Here we demonstrate that even the ultrafast pathway requires clathrin to regenerate synaptic vesicles , not at the plasma membrane but rather atthesynapticendosome . Itisprobablethatatsomesynapsesandunder some physiological conditions , clathrin acts at the plasma membrane to regenerate synaptic vesicles . Whether ultrafast endocytosis is a gen - eralmechanismora specialization forsynapses with highturnoverwill require further study .

Animals were handled according to the rules of the Berlin authorities and the animal welfare committee of the Charite´ Berlin , Germany . Hippocampi were dissected from newborn C57 / BL6 - N mice andculturedat13 3 10 3 cellspercm 2 on6mmsapphiredisksfor‘flash - and - freeze’ electron microscopy experiments and 25mm coverslips for all other experiments as previously described 10 .

A mouse CHC - 1 specific siRNA target sequence ( 5 9 - GTTG GTGACCGTTGTTATG - 3 9 ) was obtained using Genscript siRNA Target Finder ( https : / / www . genscript . com / ssl - bin / app / rnai ) and cloned as shRNA into a lenti - viralshuttlevectorunderthecontrolofaU6promoter .

Toidentifyinfectedcells , theshuttlevectorcontainedahumanSynapsin - 1promoter , driving an expression of a nuclear - targeted red fluorescent protein ( NLS – RFP ) . Western blots and immunocytochemical staining . For detection of clathrin levels by western blots , protein lysates were obtained from astrocyte - free mass cul - turesofhippocampalneurons . Briefly , cellswerelysedusing50mMTris / HCl ( pH7 . 9 ) , 150mM NaCl , 5mM EDTA , 1 % Triton - X - 100 , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 1 % sodium deoxycholate , and protease inhibitors ( cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail tablet , RocheDiagnosticsGmbH , Mannheim , Germany ) . Proteinconcentrationwasdeter - mined by BCA assay . Proteins were separated by SDS – PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulosemembranes . Membraneswerethenincubatedwithrabbitanti - CHC - 1 ( 1 : 500 , Abcam , ab21679 ) andmouseanti - tubulinIII ( 1 : 2 , 000 , Sigma - Aldrich , T8660 ) antibodies overnight at 4 u C . After incubation with corresponding horseradish peroxidase - conjugated goat secondary antibodies ( 1h at room temperature ) and ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection Reagents ( GE Healthcare Biosciences ) , chemiluminescent was imaged using a Vilber Lourmat Fusion FX7 detection sys - tem . Ratiometricquantificationofsignalintensitieswasmeasuredwiththesupplied BIO - 1D software package of the Fusion FX system . The signals are linear with the amountofproteinlysateloaded ( datanotshown ) , suggestingthatwecandetectthe clathrin signals in the knockdown without saturating the signals from the control . Immunocytochemical staining was performed on autaptic cultures . One week after infection with the shRNA constructs , cells were washed once in PBS and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) for 10min . After washing in PBS , cells were permeabilized with 0 . 1 % PBS - Tween20 for 10min and blocked in 5 % NGS for 30min . Subsequently cells were incubated with rabbit anti - CHC - 1 ( 1 : 1 , 000 , abcam , ab21679 ) and guinea pig anti - synaptophysin ( 1 : 1 , 000 , Synaptic System ) antibodies overnight at 4 u C . Primary antibodies were labelled with anti - rabbit AlexaFluor647andanti - guineapigAlexaFluor488 ( each1 : 500 , JacksonImmuno - research Laboratories ) for 1h at room temperature . After washing , coverslips were mounted with Mowiol 4 - 88 anti - fade medium ( Polysciences Europe GmbH , Eppelheim , Germany ) . Transduced cells , visible by nuclear RFP expression , were imaged using an Olympus IX81 microscope equipped with a Princenton camera and controlled by Metamorph software , with same acquisition settings for all groups . Ratiometric quantification of clathrin signals over synaptophysin signals wasconductedintheautomatedfashionusingImageJ ( NationalInstituteofHealth , Bethesda , MD ) with custom - written macros . In short , the program first subtracts uneven illumination using a ‘rolling ball’ function with the radius set at 30 pixels ( http : / / fiji . sc / Rolling _ Ball _ Background _ Subtraction ) . Then , thesynapsesaredefined by thresholding the synaptophysin signals at 15 % . The binary image of synapto - physin was used as the regions of interest . The average intensities of fluorescence signals from clathrin heavy chains and synaptopysin were measured from those locationsandweredividedtoobtainratiobetweenthosetwoproteins . Atotalof28 imagesfromthecontrolshRNAcellsand30imagesfromtheclathrinknockdown cells ( n 5 2 cultures ) were used . Electrophysiology .

Allrecordingswereperformed at 34 u C . For recordings in autapses , neurons at DIV15 – 17 were clamped at 2 70mV witha Multiclamp700Bamplifier ( MolecularDevices ) undercontrol ofClampex 9 ( MolecularDevices ) .

EPSCs were evokedbyabrief2mssomaticdepolarizationto0mV . Readily - releasablepoolsize wasdetermined bymeasuring the chargetransferofthe transientsynaptic current inducedbyapulsed5sapplicationofhypertonicsolution ( 500mMsucroseinextra - cellular solution ) . Vesicular release probability was calculated as the ratio of the chargefromtheevokedEPSC ( integratedfor1s ) andthereadily - releasablepoolsize . Electron microscopy . ‘Flash - and - freeze’ experiments were performed as prev - iously described 10 . Briefly , sapphire disks with cultured cells were mountedin the freezing chamber of the high - pressure freezer ( HPM100 , Leica ) , which was set at 34 u C . The temperature 34 u C was chosen to match the temperature of electro - physiological recordings . To minimize the exposureto room temperature , a Petri dish containing the sapphire disk was placed on a 37 u C cryopack while mount - ing , and the transparent polycarbonate sample cartridges were stored between cyropacksequilibratedto37 u C . Immediately afterthe sapphirediskwasmounted onthesampleholder , recordingsolutionkeptat37 u Cwasappliedtothespecimen andthecartridgewasinsertedintothefreezingchamberandallowedtoequilibrateto34 u C for 30s . For experiments at 37 u C ( Extended Data Fig . 2 ) , a temperature - controlled chamber ( Leica ) was placed around the specimen loading table of the high - pressure freezer . After transferring in a Petri dish , the cells were allowed to recoverinthe37 u Cchamberfor2minandthenmountedontothespecimencarriers for freezing . The freezing chamber was set at 37 u C in these experiments . Using a home - builtlightstimulationcontroller , weappliedeither1or10lightpulses ( 20Hz ) tothespecimens .

Undertheseconditionswe observemultivesicularrelease ; weestimatethatupto4synapticvesiclesarereleased per active zone ( data not shown and ref . 10 ) . We set the device so that the samples were frozen at 15 , 30 , 50 , 100 , 300 , 1 , 000 , 3 , 000 , 10 , 000 or 20 , 000ms after the initiation of the first stimulus 10 . Forferritin - loadingexperiments , cationizedferritin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) wasadded intherecordingsolutionat0 . 25mgml 2 1 . Thecalciumconcentrationwasreduced to 1mM to suppress spontaneous activity during the loading . The cells were incu - batedinthesolutionfor5minat37 u C . ForPitstop2experiments , 30 m MPitstop2 was also included in the solution , and the cells were only incubated for 2min , as longerincubationssometimesyieldeddeadcells .

In our experiments , about 1 % of synaptic profiles contained endosomes and syn - aptic vesicles that were ferritin - positive without stimulation . The absence of ferri - tin - positive coated pits on the plasma membrane in the unstimulated controls suggeststhatferritinpassesthroughendosomeseven duringspontaneousactivity . 3 m M NBQX and 30 m M bicuculline were also included in the recording media to minimize the recurrent network activity 10 . Ferritin - positive synaptic vesicles were onlyfoundin5 – 7 % synapticprofilesscoredbeforestimulationusingthisprotocol . Followinghigh - pressure freezing , sampleswere transferred intoa vialcontain - ing 1 % osmium tetroxide ( EMS ) , 1 % glutaraldehyde ( EMS ) , 1 % milliQ water , in anhydrousacetone ( EMS ) . Thefreeze - substitutionwasperformedinAFS2 ( Leica ) with the following program : 2 90 u C for 5 – 7h , 5 u C per hour to 2 20 u C , 12h at 2 20 u C , and 10 u C per hour to 20 u C . Following en bloc staining with 0 . 1 % uranyl acetate , thesampleswereinfiltratedandembeddedintoeponandcuredfor48hin a 60 u C oven . Serial 40 - nm sections were cut using a microtome ( Leica UCT ) and collected onto formvar - coated single - slot grids . Sections were stained with 2 . 5 % uranyl acetate before imaging . For ferritin experiments , sections were not stained after sectioning to improve contrast of ferritin molecules in our images—this , in turn , might have compromised our ability to distinguish clathrin - coated vesicles . Approximately150synapticprofileswerecollectedfromasinglesectionfromeachspecimen , andtheexperimentswererepeatedwithsecondculturesineachcase ( for detailed n values , seeSupplementary Table1 ) . The sample size waschosenbasedon the previous experiments that allowed us to acquire a sufficiently large set of data for statistical analysis 10 . The total numbers of synaptic profiles and tomograms analysed for these experiments are 10 , 514 and 361 , respectively .

Vesicularcompartmentswithcoatedbuds were also categorized as endosomes , which appeared frequently in our 3s time points . Vesicles are scored as clathrin - coated only if distinctive coats were visible which can lead to underscoring ( Fig . 1c andExtended Data Fig . 2c ) . Furthermore , thechanceofcapturingacoatedvesicleinagivensynapticprofileislowcomparedtoanendosomeduetoitssize . These factors will lead to an underestimate of the number of coated vesicles observed in profiles . The morphometry was performed blind using custom - written ImageJ macro and Matlab scripts ( Watanabe , Davis , and Jorgensen ) .

Typically , the entire synapses span 4 to 5 sections , when cut at 200nm . The tomograms were generated from tilt - series using IMOD . The tomograms were segmented and reconstructed using Amira or TrakEM2 . Membrane calculations . The amount of membrane on large endocytic vesicles andendosomeswascalculatedtodeterminethenumberofsynapticvesicleequiva - lents contained in these structures . These structures were scored blind and were distinguished by position in thebouton , by size , and by shape .

The surface area of endosomes was calculated by measuring the diameter and assuming a spherical shape . This calculation will lead to an underestimate of the surface area of endosomes because the membrane in budding endosomes is con - voluted . Tominimizethiserror , endosomeswithcoatedbudswerenotincludedin the calculations . After a single stimulus ( Fig . 1 ) , the mean diameter of endosomes was 116 . 4 6 3 . 0nm ( 8 synaptic vesicle equivalents ) . In the ferritin experiments with a single stimulus , the diameter of endosomes was 108 . 7 6 4 . 2nm ( 7 synaptic vesicle equivalents ) in the control and 93 . 1 6 2 . 8 nm ( 5 synaptic vesicle equiva - lents ) intheclathrinknockdown .

The smaller size of endocytic structures in the clathrin knockdowns isprobablyduetothereducedneurotransmissioninthesecells . Toconfirmtheesti - mates of surface area , we measured the surface area of complete endosomes in tomograms of wild - type synapses .

Ten stimuli were applied to scrambled shRNA ( d ) or clathrin knockdown cells ( e ) . The large endocytic vesicles are defined as those that are within 50nm of active zone and larger than a synaptic vesicle by visual inspection . Endosomes are defined as largevesiclesgreaterthan 50nmfrom theactivezone ( ofteninthecentreof the bouton ) and are larger than , 100nm . Any vesicular compartment that has coated buds in the centre of the bouton is also categorized as an endosome . The numbers of endocytic structures in ( a ) represent all the structures scored from 100ms and 300ms time points . The number of large vesicles and endosomes in b – e represent all the ferritin - positive structures from later time points ( 3 , 10 , and20s ) . InthecontrolshRNA ( b ) , thenumberoflargeendocytic vesicles and endosomes has declined by these late time points , whereas the ferritin is trapped in large endocytic vesicles and synaptic endosomes in the clathrin knockdown experiments . Because ferritin passes from large endocytic vesicles to even larger budded endosomes , it is probable that the endocytic vesicles fuse with either each other or an existing compartment .
