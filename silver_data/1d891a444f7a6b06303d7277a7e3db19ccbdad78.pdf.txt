DOI 10 . 3109 / 17453674 . 2010 . 504609 Background and purpose Autonomic neuropeptide Y ( NPY ) is involved in local bone remodeling via the central nervous system . However , the role of peripheral neuronal NPY in fracture healing is not known . We investigated the relationship between bone heal - ing and side - specific occurrence of NPY in angular and straight fractures . Methods Tibial fractures in Sprague - Dawley rats were fixed with intramedullary pins in straight alignment and anterior angulation . The samples were analyzed by radiography , histol - ogy , and immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) between 3 and 56 days postfracture . Results In the angular fractures , radiography and histology showed a 3 . 5 - fold increase in callus thickness on the concave side compared to the convex side at day 21 , whereas a 0 . 2 - fold reduc - tion in callus thickness was seen on the convex side between days 21 and 56 . IHC showed regenerating NPY fibers in the callus and woven bone in both fractures at day 7 . In angular fractures , a 5 - fold increase in NPY fibers was observed on the concave side compared to the convex side at 7 days , whereas a 6 - fold increase in NPY fibers was seen on the convex side between 21 and 56 days ; only a 0 . 1 - fold increase in NPY fibers was seen on the concave side during the same time period . In straight fractures , similar bony and neuronal changes were observed on both sides . Interpretation The increase in NPY innervation on the convex side appears to correlate with the loss of callus thickness on the same side in angular fractures . Our results highlight the probable function of the peripheral NPY system in local bone remodeling .  The ability of bone to maintain its structures and proper - ties or to remodel after trauma under different conditions is well known , but the underlying neurobiological mechanisms are poorly understood . The bone has a rich supply of nerve fibers , which can be classified as belonging to the sensory , autonomic , and opioid nervous systems according to the phe - notype of the neurotransmitters ( Bjurholm et al . 1988 , Hill et al . 1991 ) . This strongly supports the peripheral role of neu - ropeptides in bone physiology . Recently , the role of neural signaling by the central nervous system in bone remodeling through various pathways has been given some attention . One such pathway is the neuropeptide Y ( NPY ) system . NPY , a 36 amino acid peptide , belongs to a class of peptides that includes pancreatic polypeptide ( PP ) and peptide - YY ( PYY ) , which are expressed in the central and peripheral autonomic nervous system . This system signals through 5 distinct recep - tors ( Y1 , Y2 , Y4 , Y5 , and Y6 ) expressed in various tissues . NPY has several functions : among these are effects on energy homeostasis , food intake , immunity , and the cardiovascular system ( Lin et al . 2004 ) . Recently , an important role of NPY in bone homeostasis has been identified through its effect on Y2 and Y1 receptors : a study in mice with hypothalamic deletion of Y2 receptors showed a generalized increase in bone formation ( Baldock et al . 2002 ) . In contrast to this cen - tral action of Y2 receptors , the presence of Y1 receptors on osteoblasts suggests a direct local effect on these cells ( Lun - dberg et al . 2007 ) . It has been shown that mice deficient in Y1 receptors have a high bone mass ( Baldock et al . 2007 ) . Whether it occurs through NPY - ergic pathways emanating from the hypothalamus or through skeletal NPY innervation has not been determined . In the bone , NPY - immunoreactive fibers have been identi - fied in areas of high osteogenic potential such as bone marrow and the periosteum ( Bjurholm et al . 1988 , Hill et al . 1991 ) . These nerve fibers were found to be arranged as networks , mainly around blood vessels . Experimental studies in vivo have shown that NPY acts as a potent vasoconstrictor of blood vessels in bone ( Lindblad et al . 1994 ) , but its role in local bone turnover is not clear . Moreover , under conditions of trauma it is not known whether NPY participates in different biological events such as inflammation , cell proliferation , angiogenesis , vasoregulation , and callus formation . 640 Acta Orthopaedica 2010 ; 81 ( 5 ) : 639 – 646 Recently , we reported a rat model of angulated tibial fracture that showed side - specific changes in bone formation on the concave side and bone resorption on the convex side of defor - mities in the same bone ( Li et al . 2004 , 2007 ) . The process of bone formation / resorption in this animal model , leading to bone healing and remodeling , might be affected by peripheral expression of NPY because of its role in skeletal homeostasis . We therefore assessed the temporal and side - specific expres - sion of NPY at the fracture site during healing and remodeling by morphological and semiquantitative analysis using immu - nohistochemistry . Materials and methods 44 male Sprague - Dawley rats with a mean weight of 200 g were housed 3 per cage with free access to standard rat chow and water under controlled temperature and a 12 - hour light / dark cycle . All animal experiments were performed with approval from the Ethics Committee for Animal Research , Stockholm North . The rats were allocated to 3 groups as follows : 20 rats with a tibial fracture in anterior angulation ( group A ) ; 20 rats with a tibial fracture in straight alignment ( group B ) ; and 4 control rats with intact tibia ( group C ) . Surgery The rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal ( i . p . ) injec - tion of fentanyl - fluanisone ( Hypnorm , 0 . 5 mL / kg ) . The right tibia was first weakened at the mid - diaphysis by percutaneous drilling with an 18 - G needle . A small anteromedial skin inci - sion was made proximal to the tibial tubercle and a 17 - G can - nula needle was inserted through the proximal metaphyseal cortex into the medullary canal as described previously ( Li et al . 2004 ) . The tibia was then fractured by manual 3 - point bending and fixed in either 40° anterior angulation or straight alignment , which in both cases included the normal 13° ana - tomical curve of the diaphysis . Radiography The progress of fracture healing was monitored on lateral radiographs under Hypnorm anesthesia on day 0 , 7 , 21 , 35 , and 56 after fracture ( Figure 1A and B ) . The radiographic set - up was adjusted to result in size enhancement of the image by 33 % . Callus size was then measured manually on a 300 % magnified printout . The total callus size was assessed by mea - suring the transverse diameter ( in mm ) of the callus and the thickness of cortical bone anterior and posterior to the nail at the level of the apex of the angulated needle . Sampling The rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone ( 60 mg / kg , i . p . ) . 4 rats in each fracture group were killed on days 3 , 7 , 21 , 35 , and 56 , while the 4 control rats with intact tibias were killed on day 21 . In vivo intra - aortic perfusion was car - ried out with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , followed by fixation with Zamboni’s buffered 4 % paraformaldehyde solu - tion containing 0 . 2 % picric acid in 0 . 2 M Sörensen phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 2 . The right tibia was dissected and then demin - eralized at room temperature in a solution containing 7 % AlCl3 , 5 % formic acid , and 8 . 5 % HCl for 12 h . The samples were soaked in 20 % sucrose for at least 2 days . Each demin - eralized tibia was divided sagittally in two halves and 2 - cm long samples of the medial half of the tibial diaphysis , which included the proximal , middle , and distal parts of the healing fracture , were collected for analysis . Subsequently , the 2 - cm long samples were sectioned at a thickness of 15 µm using a cryostat . Thus , the regions undergoing endochondral and intramembranous ossification were all included in the same section . Immunohistochemistry Serial sections were numbered consecutively from the middle to the medial aspect . Two - interval sections , i . e . one close to the middle part and another close to the medial part of the tibia at each time point , were chosen for H & E staining and for immunostaining according to the biotin - avidin system . Thus , the sections were hydrated in 0 . 01 M PBS for 10 min and then incubated with 10 % normal goat serum at room tem - perature for 30 min . Subsequently , the sections were incu - bated at room temperature overnight in a humid atmosphere with polyclonal antibody to NPY ( 1 : 5 , 000 ; Peninsula Labo - ratories , San Carlos , CA ) . After rinsing in PBS ( 2 × 5 min ) , Figure 1 . Lateral view of tibia at day 0 and day 35 postfracture , fixed in straight alignment ( A ) and anterior angulation ( B ) . The broken squares in the X - ray images ( panels A and B ) depict the dis - sected sample for microscopic analysis of longitudinal sections shown in the schematic illustration ( C ) . The small dotted squares in the drawing of the dissected sample represent the 8 micro - scopic fields studied in each tissue sec - tion for morphological and semi - quanti - tative analysis of NPY immunoreactivity . D = day . Acta Orthopaedica 2010 ; 81 ( 5 ) : 639 – 646 641 the sections were incubated with biotinylated goat anti - rabbit antibody ( 1 : 250 ; Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , CA ) for 40 min . Finally , fluorochrome Cy3 - conjugated avidin ( 1 : 5 , 000 ; Amersham ) was used for visualization of the immune reac - tion . Control staining was performed by omitting the primary antibody . Addition of 50 µL of peptide to the correspond - ing antiserum before application to tissue sections served as another control . For double staining , after completing the staining step for NPY using fluorochrome Cy2 - conjugated avidin for visualiza - tion of the immunoreaction , the sections were incubated for 15 min with avidin - blocking solution followed by biotin - block - ing solution . The sections were then incubated with goat anti - mouse monoclonal antibody to GAP - 43 ( 1 : 2 , 000 ) , a marker of axon growth , neuronal development , and nerve regenera - tion , and mouse polyclonal antibody to PGP 9 . 5 ( 1 : 10 , 000 ; both antibodies from Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals , Germany ) , the marker for mature nerve fibers . Then the sec - tions were incubated with biotinylated anti - mouse antibodies ( 1 : 250 ; Vector Laboratories ) for 40 min . The fluorochrome Cy2 - conjugated avidin ( 1 : 1000 ; Amersham ) was used for visualization of the immunoreaction . An epifluorescence microscope was used for analysis ( 20× objective ) . Semiquantification The nerve fiber density in and adjacent to the fracture area during healing and modeling was quantified by computer - ized image analysis as previously described ( Li et al . 2007 ) . Briefly , 2 consecutive tissue sections per rat were included . In each tissue section , 4 fields ( 20× ) of each were selected in a standardized manner from the concave and convex sides , for comparison and quantification ( Figure 1C ) . For quantifi - cation by computerized image analysis , images of the tissue sections were captured by a video camera attached to the immunofluorescence microscope and then saved in a com - puter . The fields selected were analyzed using Easy Analysis software ( Bergström Instruments , Stockholm , Sweden ) . A standard lower and upper threshold of fluorescence intensity was consistently applied for positively stained nerve fibers . The results were expressed as the nerve fiber immunofluo - rescent area in relation to the total area of each microscopic field . Since there were 2 tissue sections in each rat , 8 micro - scopic fields representing the convex side and 8 other fields representing the concave side were analyzed . The mean value ( the percentage of neuronal immunofluorescenc area ) based on 8 microscopic fields was determined in 4 rats to obtain a measure of fiber density for comparison of the concave and convex sides of each tibia . Statistics For semiquantitative analysis of neuronal NPY - positive immu - nofluorescence area , a non - parametric approach was used . In each experimental group , the statistical analysis was based on the mean of the values from 4 rats at each time point . Since our data was skewed , the results are presented as mean , median , and range ( minimum and maximum ) . Mean values were used to calculate the fold differences in NPY immunoreactivity whereas median values were used to obtain the statistically significant differences between the sides . To compare the dif - ferences between the convex and concave sides within the same group , the Wilcoxon test was used . A p - value of < 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . Results Radiography Radiographic analysis showed a statistically significant increase in total callus formation from day 0 to day 21 post - fracture ( inflammatory and proliferative phases ) in both frac - ture groups . When compared to the bone thickness of each side at day 0 , the angular fracture exhibited a 3 . 5 - fold increase in callus thickness on the concave side , whereas only a 0 . 2 - fold increase in callus thickness was observed on the convex side at day 21 ( p = 0 . 03 ) . During the remodeling phase , i . e . between day 21 and day 56 , a 0 . 2 - fold reduction in callus thickness was observed on the convex side ( p = 0 . 05 ) , while the callus thickness remained almost the same on the concave side , as compared to day 21 . In the straight fracture , an almost equal increase in callus thickness was observed on the concave side ( 1 . 9 - fold ) and on the convex side ( 1 . 1 - fold ) , reaching a peak at day 21 . It then decreased gradually , in a similar way on both sides . Histology The longitudinal sections of tibia were stained with H & E at 7 , 21 , and 35 days postfracture in both fracture groups ( Figure 2 ) . In the straight fracture , a similar histological picture depicting different phases of bone repair was seen on the two sides of the fracture . Thus , there were equal amounts of new woven bone and callus formation at day 7 , complete thickened cortical bridging at day 21 , and reduction in cortical size with normal bone architecture at day 35 . However , in the angular fracture a different histological picture was seen , with dispar - ity in bone repair between the concave and the convex sides . The increase in the size of new woven bone and callus forma - tion was greater on the concave side than on the convex side at day 7 ( Figure 2A and B ) . At day 21 , cortical bridging was complete with periosteal hypertrophy and intense new bone formation on the concave side , whereas these changes were much less apparent on the convex side ( Figure 2C and D ) . At day 35 , a further reduction in cortical thickness was observed on the convex side whereas it remained the same on the con - cave side , representing normal bone architecture ( Figure 2E and F ) . The morphological changes representing callus thick - ness between the concave and convex sides were based on observations in 4 rats at each time point ( Figure 2A and F ) . 642 Acta Orthopaedica 2010 ; 81 ( 5 ) : 639 – 646 Distribution of NPY nerve fibers in fractures NPY - positive nerve fibers were identified in the intact tibia and at the fracture site in both straight and angular fractures at all time points of the study . In angulated fractures , ingrowth of nerve fibers containing NPY was already observed at day 3 postfracture in the frac - ture hematoma arranged as non - vascular nerve fibers ( Figure 3A and B ) . At day 7 , an increased number of NPY - positive fibers was found on the concave side compared to the convex side . These nerve fibers were seen as fibers sprouting into the fibrocartilage callus from the deep layers of the periosteum . Many fibers were seen close to the chondroid cells , and Figure 2 . Hematoxylin and eosin ( H & E ) staining ( A - F ) showing changes in bone thickness on the convex ( anterior ) side ( A , C , and E ) and the concave ( posterior ) side ( B , D , and F ) of the angulated fracture at day 7 ( A and B ) , 21 ( C and D ) , and 35 ( E and F ) after fracture . The arrows depict the thickness of woven bone or new bone , showing intensive bone formation on the concave side at early phases of fracture healing ( days 7 and 21 ) and intense reduction of bone thickness on the convex side at a later phase of fracture healing ( day 35 ) .

Acta Orthopaedica 2010 ; 81 ( 5 ) : 639 – 646 643 they had entered the new - woven bone ( Figure 3C and D ) . Between days 21 and 35 , NPY - positive fibers were mainly observed as networks in and around the walls of blood ves - sels , both in the deeper layers of hypotrophic periosteum and in the new bone on the concave side , whereas few vascular fibers entering into new bone were found on the convex side ( Figure 4A and B ) . At day 56 postfracture , during the remod - eling , most of the NPY - positive fibers were seen retracted from the fracture site and were present as vascular fibers in the periosteum . In straight fractures , the occurrence and distribution of NPY - positive fibers over the time period was similar to that seen in the angular fracture , with one notable difference . An increased number of NPY - positive fibers with similar amount were seen penetrating the woven bone on both sides of the fracture at day 7 . No side - specific differences in expression were found over time . Double - staining experiments showed that there was co - expression of GAP 43 , a marker of regenerating nerve fibers , with NPY - positive fibers at the fracture site in both groups at all time points . The co - localization of GAP 43 with NPY was more intense between days 3 and 21 postfracture than that at the later time periods ( Figure 5A and C ) . Double - staining studies of PGP 9 . 5 , a neuronal marker of mature nerve fibers and NPY showed a co - localization that was less obvious at days 3 – 21 , but which became more pronounced at days 35 – 56 postfracture ( Figure 5B and D ) . Semiquantitative analysis of NPY innervation In general , there was a statistically significant increase in the number of nerve fibers expressing NPY at the fracture site in both straight and angular fractures at days 7 , 21 , and 35 post - fracture as compared to intact tibia ( Table ) . In angular fractures , a 5 - fold increase in NPY - immunore - active fibers was seen on the concave side as compared to the convex side when comparison was made with the innerva - tion of intact bone at day 7 . Notably , a statistically signifi - cant ( 6 - fold ) increase in NPY - positive fibers was seen on the convex side between days 21 and 56 , whereas the correspond - ing increase in NPY was only 0 . 1 - fold on the concave side during the same time period , when compared to day 7 ( Table ) . Interestingly , the peak in NPY - positive fibers was only seen on the convex side in the angular fractures at days 21 and 35 . Although the amount of NPY - positive fibers was similar on the concave and convex sides in the angular fractures between days 21 and 56 , an increase in NPY innervation on the convex side was observed , but it was not statistically significant .

A Mean B Median C Range D P - value 644 Acta Orthopaedica 2010 ; 81 ( 5 ) : 639 – 646 In the straight fractures , a statistically significant increase in NPY - positive fibers was found both on the concave side ( by a factor of 0 . 6 ) and on the convex side ( by a factor of 0 . 4 ) when compared to intact tibia at day 7 . The maximum increase in NPY - positive fibers ( by a factor of 1 ) was observed on both sides in the straight fractures at day 35 , the phase of bone remodeling . Later , the density of NPY fibers returned to the normal ( intact ) level on both sides of the fracture ( Table ) . Discussion Our study demonstrates temporal and side - specific changes in NPY innervation during the early and the late phase of angular fracture healing . The early increase in NPY innervation seen on the bone - forming concave side during the inflammatory phase may be a response to injury with the possible stimula - tory effects on cell proliferation and angiogenesis leading to enhanced bone formation . The increased expression of NPY seen on the convex ( bone resorption ) side during the remod - eling phase appears to coincide with the reduction in callus thickness . The later increase in NPY expression on the convex side may reflect the role of NPY in bone resorption , possibly through the Y1 receptor . Given the proposed central role of NPY in bone homeostasis , our results suggest that NPY may have a peripheral neuronal function in local bone turnover , especially during fracture healing and correction of angular deformity . The early inflammatory phase of fracture healing lays the foundation for bone healing as inflammatory cells secrete a number of proinflammatory cytokines with bone induction properties . Accordingly , the cascade of reparative processes such as matrix synthesis , cell proliferation , angiogenesis , and neurogenesis is induced . Our results show an intense but simi - lar pattern of nerve regeneration containing autonomic neu - ropeptide NPY in the fracture callus and woven bone on the two sides of a straight fracture ( Figures 3 and 5 ) . However , in an angular fracture this phenomenon of nerve regenera - tion was observed mainly on the concave side ( Figure 3B and D ) ( Table ) . The regenerative nature of NPY immunoreactive fibers observed in the inflammatory phase of fracture healing was confirmed by identification of co - expression of GAP - 43 , a neuronal marker of nerve regeneration , in the NPY - positive fibers ( Figure 5 ) . It is presumed that increased delivery of NPY from the nerve endings during the inflammatory phase of fracture healing would exert a beneficial effect on bone repair by modulating various cellular events . A number of studies have suggested that NPY exerts a strong angiogenic effect , mainly on the Y2 receptor ( Y2R ) ( Ekstrand et al . 2003 , Lee et al . 2003 ) . In vitro studies have shown that NPY pro - motes vessel sprouting and adhesion , migration , prolifera - tion , and capillary tube formation in human endothelial cells ( Zukowska - Grojec et al . 1998 , Movafagh et al . 2006 ) . Fur - thermore , it has been shown that vessel sprouting is reduced to 50 % after deleting Y2R or by using antagonists of Y2R ( Lee et al . 2003 ) . In addition , a delay in skin wound healing and reduced neovascularization was observed in mice lacking Y2R ( Ekstrand et al . 2003 ) . It is known that early angiogen - esis at the fracture site is one of the most important parameters influencing the healing process ( Keramaris et al . 2008 ) . Our study has shown early proliferation of nerve fibers containing NPY at the fracture site where increased callus formation is observed ( concave side in angular fractures and on both sides in straight fractures ) , which possibly contributes to the heal - ing process by stimulating angiogenesis ( Figure 3 and 5 ) . In addition to angiogenesis , recent studies have shown a possible role of NPY in neurogenesis . A potential role of NPY in the survival and the regenerative process of neurons was indicated by the dramatic increase in NPY expression in dorsal root ganglia after peripheral nerve injury ( Wakisaka et al . 1991 ) . Moreover , a possible proliferative effect of NPY on neuro - blasts in different areas of the neonatal and adult brain has been shown to be mediated mainly through Y1R ( Howell et al . 2003 , 2005 ) . In addition to the CNS , NPY has also been iden - tified as a neurotrophic factor in the peripheral nervous system by showing its regenerative effect on olfactory epithelium ( Hansel et al . 2001 , Hökfelt et al . 2008 ) . It has been shown that NPY acting through Y1R stimulates the proliferation of adult olfactory neuroblasts . Conversely , NPY - deficient mice were found to show a significant reduction in olfactory neuro - nal precursor cell proliferation ( Hansel et al . 2001 ) . Recently , it has been shown that increased release of NPY promotes the regeneration of damaged olfactory sensory neurons ( Kanekar et al . 2009 ) . Altogether , the role of NPY implicated in neu - roangiogenesis might set up the initial framework for a satis - factory bone - healing process . We have recently established a rat model of angular frac - ture of the tibia , which covers not only the healing process but also the subsequent bone remodeling ( Li et al . 2004 , 2007 ) . In these studies , angulation gave a clear - cut difference in local bone turnover between the concave and convex sides of the fracture . We also found intense bone formation on the concave side whereas bone resorption predominated on the convex side , both sides thereby contributing to spontaneous correction of the angular deformity ( Figure 1 and 2 ) . Notably , our angular fracture model also permits sequential analysis of local mediators involved in bone formation and resorp - tion within well - defined areas of the same bone at different stages of fracture healing . Thus , we have observed increased expression of the sensory neuropeptide CGRP on the concave side , where intense new bone formation occurred . On the convex side where bone resorption predominated , there was an increase in the occurrence of the bone resorption cytokine interleukin - 1 ( Li et al . 2004 , 2007 ) , as confirmed by others ( Gordon et al . 2008 ) . In the present study a reduction in callus thickness during the remodeling phase which coincided with a 6 - fold increase in NPY expression on the convex side , probably highlights Acta Orthopaedica 2010 ; 81 ( 5 ) : 639 – 646 645 the role of NPY in bone resorption . Even though there is no conclusive evidence to implicate NPY - mediated signaling in bone homeostasis , a number of studies have indicated the probable role of NPY in local bone turnover through the cen - tral and peripheral nervous system ( Baldock et al . 2002 , 2007 , Lundberg et al . 2007 ) . Recent studies analyzing germ line or conditional knockout mice lacking Y2R have revealed that the osteoblast activity is controlled by a central pathway through hypothalamus . These studies have shown an increased rate of bone mineralization and elevated bone mass due to increased osteoblast activity in Y2R knockout mice ( Lundberg et al . 2007 ) . However , the presence of neuronal NPY in high osteo - genic areas such as the periosteum , epiphysis growth plate , and bone marrow may suggest a role of NPY in local bone turnover by a peripheral pathway ( Bjurholm et al . 1988 , Hill and Elde 1991 ) . Recently , the Y1 receptor was reported to be present in human osteoblastic and osteosarcoma - derived cell lines ( Lundberg et al . 2007 ) , and treatment of wild - type mice with NPY caused reduction in bone mass and volume ( Ducy et al . 2000 ) . In addition , in vitro studies have demonstrated that NPY can inhibit the osteoblastic parathyroid hormone response through a receptor - receptor interaction ( Bjurholm et al . 1992 ) . A more direct effect of NPY on bone cells involved in bone remodeling has been reported . Not only the presence of Y1R on osteoblasts but also a generalized increase in bone formation on the cortical and cancellous surfaces of bone has been shown in Y1R - deleted mice ( Lundberg et al . 2007 ) . It can be assumed that the elevated levels of NPY seen in our study caused an overstimulation of Y1R on osteoblasts , lead - ing to bone resorption on the convex side of the fracture . In summary , we have demonstrated upregulation in neu - ronal expression of NPY during the early and late phases of angular fracture healing , thus highlighting a probable role of NPY in local bone remodeling . The findings of this study combined with those in previous reports suggest that NPY may play a role in the regulation of skeletal homeostasis , probably through Y1R . Therapeutic application of the NPY system has emerged as a promising area of research in clini - cal orthopedics . A useful approach in this regard would be the anti - ligand / anti - receptor strategy to prevent or minimize bone loss in a number of skeletal disorders such as tumor , trauma , and infection .
