This works - in - progress paper describes formative work towards designing online communities centered on gratitude , in which we elicited views on gratitude and on expressing gratitude within online communities . We found that people have unique views of and contexts for gratitude and discussed how the unique views and contexts relate to concerns they have around expressing gratitude in an online community . We describe plans for a follow - up study to better understand people’s views on expressing gratitude in an online community through the use of Gratitude , a simple online communal gratitude platform where users interact in ways similar to many online communities , through creating short posts ( e . g . , notes of gratitude ) that other members can browse , react to , and comment on .

However , despite many demonstrated bene - fits [ 18 , 89 ] , social media sites have also been heavily criticized for decreasing real - life social communication , increasing depres - sion [ 38 , 50 ] , facilitating misinformation [ 65 ] , and breeding toxic anti - social interactions [ 66 ] . Prior research has demonstrated that grateful reflection is associated with improved well - being and proso - cial behaviors that build community [ 5 , 23 , 25 , 33 ] . In the context of online communities , studies have found that both expressing and receiving gratitude increased a sense of relatedness within online volunteering communities , predicting member engagement and well - being [ 103 ] . Moreover , a growing body of work on communal gratitude has led to the development of a “gratitude cycle” frame - work , which which models how expressing gratitude to members of a community who perform kind acts creates a positive cycle of altruistic behavior and gratitude expression [ 55 ] . These observations lead us to ask : How might we best design prosocial online communities centered on gratitude ? What insights might this teach us about how a focus on positive activities — such as grateful reflections — may create prosocial online communities ? We believe that shared , public expressions of gratitude may foster positive connections with other members in the online community , yet we know very little about the impact that these actions might have . How might members feel about posting about gratitude pub - licly ? How might this affect the way they use the online platform , given their experiences with other social media platforms ? In what follows , we discuss related literature on online prosocial and antisocial behaviors , as well as gratitude , ( Sections 2 ) and then describe early formative interviews in which we elicited views on gratitude and views on expressing gratitude in an online community context . We present the unique views of and contexts for gratitude that people expressed and how these related to concerns they had about expressing gratitude in an online community ( Sections 3 ) . We then discuss promising directions we see for design ( Sections 4 ) followed by a description of a simple gratitude - centered online community that we developed and our plans for our full study that will : 1 ) expand on our early interviews and 2 ) use our simple plat - form to further elicit insights on the opportunities and challenges in designing an online community centered on gratitude ( Sections 5 ) . Our hope is that this study can provide some lessons for how to 182 CSCW ’23 Companion , October 14 – 18 , 2023 , Minneapolis , MN , USA Ho and Lei , et al . design online communities supporting positive social connections while minimizing negative impact on members . 2 RELATED WORK Prosocial and Antisocial Behaviors in Online Communities The explosive growth of online communities has created intel - lectual , social , and cultural value for its members [ 80 ] , as well as economic benefits for commercial brands [ 71 ] . Active partic - ipation and contribution of users are crucial for the success of online communities [ 46 , 64 ] . However , this has also given rise to a significant amount of anti - social behaviors , including but not limited to trolling [ 8 , 36 , 74 ] , harassment [ 32 , 92 , 93 ] , and cyber - bullying [ 4 , 101 ] . These behaviors can have a negative impact on individuals’ psychological well - being [ 7 , 60 , 68 ] , leading to further antisocial behaviors [ 15 , 16 ] . Current research on online antisocial behaviors focuses on understanding the motivations behind anti - social behaviors [ 53 , 81 , 85 , 91 ] and exploring how to reduce them through multiple methods , such as moderation [ 11 – 13 , 39 , 45 , 51 ] , prediction [ 75 ] , governance [ 27 , 76 , 105 ] , and deep listening [ 48 , 49 ] . A large body of research also focuses on prosocial behaviors such as altruism [ 28 , 54 , 88 ] , reciprocity [ 6 , 30 ] , and gratitude [ 41 , 47 ] , which tend to be interrelated with each other [ 58 ] . Prosocial be - haviors can help users gain social support from other community members [ 96 ] , which can translate into real - world support [ 73 ] . In HCI literature , a rich vein of work have investigated how prosocial behaviors exist in specific community types , such as altruism in gaming communities [ 61 ] , reciprocity in online health communi - ties [ 100 , 102 ] , and social learning in social media [ 22 , 56 ] . However , a few studies have explored how to promote prosocial behaviors in online communities through platform designs [ 2 , 78 ] . In this paper , we are interested in how centering an online community on positive , value - driven activities such as gratitude might help in the design of prosocial online communities . Gratitude , Mental Health , and Group Dynamics Gratitude has been defined in various ways in the literature [ 24 , 59 , 72 , 97 ] . Generally , gratitude is conceptualized as a positive emotion that leads to prosocial behaviors [ 23 , 57 ] . A wide range of studies in psychology have demonstrated its benefits for individuals’ mental health [ 17 , 69 , 90 ] , such as reducing stress [ 52 ] and promoting happiness [ 44 ] . While most research has focused on the individual benefits of gratitude [ 43 , 62 , 95 ] , there is a growing interest in exploring its social nature , particularly in the context of groups [ 87 ] . As gratitude has been recognized as an inherently social emo - tion [ 10 , 84 ] that can help strengthen social bonds [ 1 , 3 ] , there has been a growing call to examine its social nature [ 104 ] . Studies have shown that gratitude in groups can amplify positive emotional effects [ 83 ] by encouraging individuals to pass on kindness to oth - ers [ 14 ] . Several concepts have been proposed to explain gratitude dynamics in groups , including group - context gratitude where indi - viduals practice gratitude while aware of others doing the same [ 20 ] , collective gratitude as a shared emotion among members of an orga - nization [ 29 ] , and joint gratitude as a collective action [ 19 ] . Recently , a “gratitude cycle” framework has been proposed to present how gratitude is organically expressed and acknowledged within ex - isting online communities [ 55 ] . Our study aims to build on and integrate this literature towards an understanding of how to de - sign a gratitude - centered online community . We seek to build on the concept of group - context gratitude to characterize practices of gratitude in the context of online communities , consider how one might encourage shared gratitude in the community , and explore the role of gratitude as a collective action in the design . Digital Tools to Promote Practices of Gratitude Gratitudeinterventionsarecommonlyused topromotegratitude [ 26 ] , requiring participants to engage in regular gratitude activities to enhance their gratitude experience [ 21 , 79 ] . Compared to prior paper - based gratitude intervention research [ 67 ] , recent studies have focused on exploring digital gratitude intervention techniques through , for example , text messages [ 70 ] , augmented reality [ 9 ] , social media [ 58 ] , and speech assistants [ 37 ] to support gratitude ac - tivities . Expressing gratitude through digital technology can bring happiness [ 40 ] and produce fewer negative emotional effects than face - to - face communication [ 82 ] . In the post - COVID - 19 world , dig - ital gratitude intervention techniques have been utilized to help colleagues in remote work environments build positive connec - tions [ 86 , 99 ] . In recent years , with the significantly increased usage of so - cial media , a few researchers have started to explore the relation - ship between gratitude interventions and SNSs ( social networking sites ) [ 35 ] . Koay et al . first reported the positive effects of using social media in gratitude interventions on Instagram [ 42 ] , while Sciara et al . further investigated how grateful interactions on Face - book can be observed , learned and imitated to amplify the spread of gratitude [ 77 ] . Additionally , research has shown that simply wit - nessing expressions of gratitude can enhance the life satisfaction and happiness of the observers [ 94 ] . Although some research has investigated the possibility of digital interventions in facilitating grateful interactions on social networking sites , we are not aware of any existing framework that actively integrates gratitude practices into the development of SNSs . Considering the capacity of social media to facilitate emotional contagion [ 31 , 98 ] , we believe that social media sites have the potential to promote gratitude activities in online communities , and that this in turn , can help with our understanding of designing prosocial online communities . 3 EARLY REACTIONS TO EXPRESSING GRATITUDE IN AN ONLINE COMMUNITY To inform the design of our full study , we conducted a brief pilot study in which we conducted 30 - minute long semi - structured inter - views to gather qualitative data from representative users on their current experiences with social media , online communities , and gratitude practices , and their views and expectations for communal gratitude practices . For this early study , we interviewed 3 partici - pants recruited through convenience sampling and analyzed the interviews through affinity mapping to determine common themes and insights . Analysisofthesethreeearlyinterviewshelpedelicitthreethemes that point to two key areas of consideration . Two of our themes indicated hesitation around the adoption of communal gratitude 183 Understanding People’s Views on Expressing Gratitude in an Online Community CSCW ’23 Companion , October 14 – 18 , 2023 , Minneapolis , MN , USA platforms . One additional theme centered on the diverse defini - tions of and contexts for gratitude . We briefly present these themes along with illustrative quotes and discuss potential implications for design in the following section . Posting publicly may foster performative gratitude and ego - driven motivations We discovered that some participants were worried about posting to boost their egos , rather than to communicate value or genuine grati - tude towards others . Sharing appreciative messages in a community may feel performative , when compared to directly messaging a re - cipient privately . • P1 : “I think one thing that’s scary about social media is that , like , you don’t know if you’re doing things to post for yourself , or if you’re doing it for your audience . ” • P2 : “If you want to hear the uncharitable interpretation , the uncharitable interpretation is to flex on people . ” Questioning the necessity or value of public expressions of gratitude Beyond initial concerns about possible self - serving purposes of posting publicly , all three participants questioned the need to share their gratitude practice with others or to express appreciation to a recipient publicly . Grateful reflection can be a private practice for some , and it may not seem important or necessary to share those feelings with an audience . • P2 : “I think that it is kind of like a personal thing , like , if you are privately grateful . . . I don’t really see a reason why you have to share this or make it external . ” • P3 : “I think it’s not necessary to share the gratitude practice with others . ” Reactions reflected diverse definitions of , and contexts for , gratitude The discussion around perceived authenticity of sharing gratitude messages publicly versus privately illustrates the importance of understanding how different people perceive gratitude practices , and what contexts they are more or less comfortable with . We discovered that participants may view the emotion of gratitude primarily as internal , external , or a combination of the two , which impacts their comfort with sharing expressions of gratitude within a community . Internal expressions of gratitude are classified as emotions or mindsets that are self - contained , whereas external expressions of gratitude have both a sender / writer and at least one recipient that is directly addressed . • P1 : “It’s a mindset . . . like training yourself to be mindful and considerate and grateful for things that you have . ” • P2 : “There’s expression to yourself , and there’s expression to other people , one being internal , one being external . ” • P3 : “I think gratitude is just the ability to express appreciation to others . ” In addition , the context provided by the communities matters . Existing relationships and value systems may impact how a public message of gratitude is perceived or accepted . Public posts of grati - tude towards others may be more acceptable when the relationship between the writer and recipient is not especially personal , or if the recipient values public displays of appreciation . • P2 : “In a professional setting , I don’t have a personal rela - tionship to these people , and I do hope they get some sort of external award . ” • P1 : “Actually , I think it also depends on [ their ] love language , because I know some people are more receptive to public shows of affection . ” 4 DISCUSSION Our early findings suggest that variations in how people define grat - itude and the contexts within which they are expressing gratitude influence their desire to post publicly and the value they derive from an environment for communal gratitude . We see this as a promising direction for further exploration . For example , what are the diverse goals and motivations for expressing gratitude and how should one best support them in a platform for communal gratitude ? We saw at least a few different goals expressed in our small set of participants : growing an internal quality of being grateful , expressing gratitude for a person , and praising someone publicly . In the first two cases , it is clear that one has to be very careful about how public expressions of grat - itude might create extrinsic motivations that crowd out intrinsic ones [ 34 ] , and this is likely true for any online community that aims to center positive , value - driven activities . How might certain environments affect the decision to post gratitude messages in a community ? Can public expressions of gratitude foster a collabo - rative feeling of sharing in , supporting , and receiving support for practices of gratitude rather than a performative one ? What moti - vates individuals to post with the intention of impressing others versus truly appreciating them ? What practices of gratitude should remain private , and are there ways that even private expressions of gratitude can contribute to communal aspects of gratitude ? A related consideration is the presence or absence of a recipient when expressing gratitude . Gratitude , when defined as a state of thankfulness independent of interpersonal relationships , has been researched using interventions such as journaling and linked to enhanced well - being . On the other hand , However , gratitude mes - sages directed at specific recipients in response to interpersonal events may differ in format . Specifically , how do expressions with - out a recipient differ from those that have one , and how can we support these interactions within an online community ( and our platform ) ? How does the presence or absence of a recipient affect intrinsic and extrinsic motivations around gratitude ? Finally , what are the diverse relational contexts that exist for expressing gratitude ( e . g . , personal , professional , affinity - based ) and how should we best support them in a platform for communal gratitude ? Preliminary findings suggest that in closer , personal re - lationships , there may be a preference for direct communication of gratitude ( through a direct message or in - person ) as it feels more authentic and less performative . On the other hand , in profes - sional relationships or more distant friendships , public posts that show appreciation or acknowledgement seem to be more widely accepted . What is the value that people derive from these differ - ent relationships and how can practices of gratitude strengthen those relationships ? How might external value systems in existing 184 CSCW ’23 Companion , October 14 – 18 , 2023 , Minneapolis , MN , USA Ho and Lei , et al . Figure 1 : ( Left ) Users see weekly gratitude prompts , community decks they can contribute to , and journal entries of past gratitude notes written . ( Right ) Community decks consist of gratitude notes that users can browse and react to . communities affect public expressions of gratitude , and how should communal practices of gratitude be designed in light of these ? As we explore these questions , we are also interested in under - standing how the affordances of digital technologies and online communities might help one to thread the needle in supporting diverse goals and contexts through dynamics not possible in tra - ditional ones . For example , suppose that having recipients com - plicates motivations for growing an internal state of thankfulness , but that having recipients can help foster a cycle of gratitude in the community . In that case , one might prompt people to write reflective notes of gratitude that do not have explicit recipients , but then extract out implicit audiences ( e . g . teachers , park rangers , coffee baristas , etc . ) from those notes to direct them to . 5 A SIMPLE GRATITUDE - CENTERED ONLINE COMMUNITY FOR STUDYING VIEWS ON COMMUNAL GRATITUDE Besides improving the rigor of our semi - structured interviews and analysis , we also seek to more deeply elicit people’s views on ex - pressing gratitude in an online community by having participants use Gratitude , a simple platform that enables people to share and read expressions of gratitude from others in their communities . Gratitude is designed to be analogous to the standard dynamics of online communities today , where people can make short posts to communities as well as browse and react to posts that others made , and is built using the Angular framework with Google Firebase for the backend database . We want to understand to what extent the standard dynamic was able to support communal gratitude and in what ways participants viewed it as limiting . In Gratitude , a user is a member of one or more communities . The moderators of these communities can create gratitude prompts that encourage reflection and expression of gratitude in the commu - nities they are a part of . For the purpose of this study , we defined the prompts to elicit particular things we’re interested in . Users see these gratitude prompts in the main dashboard view and can re - spond by writing a gratitude note . When they do so , their response is added to a ‘community deck’ corresponding to that prompt . All community members can navigate to these community decks to browse all responses for a prompt and react to them with emojis or comments . To encourage users in writing gratitude notes , the platform shows users their ‘gratitude streak’ , the number of recent consecutive weeks during which they responded to a gratitude prompt . This streak is visualized in the form of a seed , which grad - ually blossoms into a flower . Finally , users can view past gratitude notes ( their ‘gratitude journal’ ) and browse community decks . For our study , we plan to recruit new participants from one community and interview them about their practices and views of gratitude , and then have them use Gratitude over a month - long period , after which we will analyze platform logs and interview them again to elicit further perspectives on their experience , their interactions with others , and their views on what they’d like to see in an online community for gratitude . We look forward to further exploring how these experiences and views relate to the unique ways that people view communal gratitude practices . Our hope is that this work will provide insights around how one might design platforms centered around gratitude specifically , as well as more broadly the design of prosocial online communities centered on other positive , value - driven activities .
