The Road Ahead for Mining Software Repositories Ahmed E .

Who ? When ? Where ? Mining supports software understanding ( NETBSD ) • Eight unexpected dependencies • All except two dependencies existed since day one : – Virtual Address Maintenance (cid:5) Pager – Pager (cid:5) Hardware Translations Auto - generated from CVS repository 7 Which ? vm _ map _ entry _ create ( in src / sys / vm / Attic / vm _ map . c ) depends on pager _ map ( in / src / sys / uvm / uvm _ pager . c ) Who ? cgd When ? 1993 / 04 / 09 15 : 54 : 59 Revision 1 . 2 of src / sys / vm / Attic / vm _ map . c Why ? from sean eric fagan : it seems to keep the vm system from deadlocking the system when it runs out of swap + physical memory . prevents the system from giving the last page ( s ) to anything but the referenced " processes " ( especially important is the pager process , which should never have to wait for a free page ) . Opportunities in the Road Ahead Repository Extract Analyze Adopt Results Show Value • Going beyond code and bugs • Taming the complexity of MSR Taming the complexity of MSR • Showing the value of repositories • Easing the adoption of MSR Opportunities in the Road Ahead Repository Extract Analyze Adopt Results Show Value Going beyond code and bugs MSR 2004 - 2008 : ~ 80 % of publications focus on code and bugs • Explore non - structured data – Social aspects : emails and comments 9 – Social aspects : emails and comments • Link data between repos • Seek non - traditional repos – Demonstrate the value of IDE interactions or build failures repos • Understand the limitation of repos – Causation vs . Correlation • Small number of committers in OS projects Opportunities in the Road Ahead Repository Extract Analyze Adopt Results Show Value • Simplify the extraction of high quality data Taming the complexity of MSR main ( ) { int a ; / * call help * / helpInfo ( ) ; } helpInfo ( ) { errorString ! } main ( ) { int a ; / * call help * / h l I f ( ) helpInfo ( ) { int b ; } main ( ) { int a ; / * call help * / h l I f ( ) 10 – Toolkits and extracted data ( e . g . FLOSSMetrics ) are needed – Heuristics should be empirically verified – Acknowledgement mechanism needed for extractors • Deal with skew in repository data – Visualization can help spot skew – Guidelines and re - sampling / robust techniques are needed • Improve the quality of repository data – Provide tools for annotation of repos data at creation helpInfo ( ) ; } helpInfo ( ) ; } V1 : Undefined func .
