Accepted 25 July 2012 Published Online First 3 September 2012 ABSTRACTObjective Cortactin acts as a prominent substrate of histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) and plays important roles in tumour progression in several human cancers . However , the clinical signi ﬁ cance of its expression in human prostate cancer ( PCa ) has not been determined . We aimed to identify the potential role of cortactin expression in tumour progression and prognosis in PCa and the association with HDACs . Methods 256 foci with distinctive lesions in 110 prostate specimens were collected to identify the status of among cortactin , SIRT2 , histone deacetylase 6 ( HDAC6 ) by immunohistochemistry and its relationship with clinicopathological and follow - up data were analysed . Results The results showed that cortactin expression was signi ﬁ cantly higher ( 79 . 1 % ) , and SIRT2 expression was lower ( 37 . 3 % ) in PCa foci , when it was compared with high - grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia foci and benign foci , respectively . HDAC6 expression was low and had no statistical signi ﬁ cance in PCa . High intensity of cortactin staining was signi ﬁ cantly and independently associated with a high prostate - speci ﬁ c antigen ( PSA ) level , high Gleason score , clinical stage progression and shortened survival time in patients with PCa . High intensity of SIRT2 staining was signi ﬁ cantly and independently associated with a high PSA level , old age , high Gleason score and clinical stage progression . Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed cortactin expression was a signi ﬁ cant prognostic factor for survival of patients with PCa ( β , 0 . 736 ; 95 % CI 1 . 371 to 3 . 181 ; p = 0 . 001 ) . Conclusions The results suggested that cortactin seems to be a satisfactory marker to predict tumour progression and survival in cases of PCa . And it may be SIRT2 rather than HADAC6 is responsible for tumour occurrence and the progression of PCa . INTRODUCTION Prostate cancer ( PCa ) is the most common form of cancer and second leading cause of cancer death in men . 1 Currently , clinical stage , serological prostate - speci ﬁ c antigen ( PSA ) level and Gleason grading still dominate the realm of outcome prediction , and it is imperative to explore more sensitive and ef ﬁ cient indicators of clinical outcome that can be used to choose an appropriate treatment for patients with PCa . 2 – 4 The analysis of tumour molecular markers may eventually allow the better prediction of cancer behaviour because the devel - opment of cancer is driven by gene regulation . 5 Invasion and metastasis are the distinct clinical characteristics of malignancy , which is re ﬂ ected by the enhancement of cell motility . 6 7 Cell motility is powered by the mechanical activity of the actin cytoskeleton . 8 Recent studies have characterised that histone deacetylase 6 ( HDAC6 ) , a member of the class II histone deacetylases , and SIRT2 , a class III NAD + - dependent histone deacetylase , use the cytoplasmic a - tubulin subunit of microtubules as substrate in addition to target histones . 9 Cortactin was taken as the cytoplasmic substrate by HDAC6 or / and SIRT2 , 10 and the change of acetylation status of cortactin could increase cell mobility and accelerate invasion and metastasis in tumour pro - gression . 11 – 14 Cortactin , a protein that binds to cortical actin , was identi ﬁ ed as an src kinase substrate that acti - vates the actin - related protein 2 / 3 complex . 6 15 Studies have demonstrated that cortactin partici - pates in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton forma - tion and , thereby , the mechanism for controlling tumour cell migration , invasion and metastasis . 16 – 18 Cortactin is encoded by the CTTN gene and mapped to human chromosome 11q13 , which has been shown to be ampli ﬁ ed and expressed in several carcinomas , including head / neck squamous cell carcinomas , 19 20 renal cell carcinoma 21 and breast cancer . 18 Further , the high expression of cor - tactin correlated with advanced clinicopathological stage and poor prognosis . 19 21 – 25 Although cortactin , SIRT2 and HDAC6 have been studied in in vitro PCa models 10 26 27 the observation of these tumour markers in human PCa tissues in situ remains scarce . In this study , we investigated the expression of cortactin , SIRT2 and HDAC6 in PCa using immunohistochemistry . We demonstrated that the expression of these tumour markers was signi ﬁ cantly and independ - ently correlated with clinicopathological para - meters ( ie , age , PSA , Gleason score , TNM stage , survival time ) and that they may represent novel predictive biomarkers for the PCa . MATERIALS AND METHODS Specimens and study patients For immunohistochemical analysis , 110 patients ( 67 needle biopsies , 33 transurethral resections of prostate ( TURP ) and 10 suprapubic transvesical prostatectomy ) between 2003 and 2010 diagnosed with PCa were selected for the evaluation of cor - tactin , HDAC6 and SIRT2 . The criterion for recruitment followed that the frank cancerous tissue exceeded 5 % of the core or 1 mm of the 1088 J Clin Pathol 2012 ; 65 : 1088 – 1096 . doi : 10 . 1136 / jclinpath - 2012 - 200940 Original article group . bmj . com on January 5 , 2014 - Published by jcp . bmj . com Downloaded from length of each sample , and no patients with PCa previously received any treatment . Patient ’ s information and available clinicopathological data were obtained from the Department of Pathology and the Department of Urology at the First Af ﬁ liated Hospital of the Xi ’ an Jiaotong University , China . A total of 256 aim foci from the 110 samples including 110 PCa foci , 69 high - grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia ( HGPIN ) foci and 77 benign foci were analysed . The median age of the 110 patients with PCa was 71 years ( mean 71 . 0 years , range 44 – 85 years ) , with 42 cases aged less than 70 years and 68 cases exceeding 70 years . The median serum PSA prior to biopsy or operation was 78 . 8 ng / ml ( mean 124 . 8 ng / ml , range 6 – 1800 ng / ml ) , with 23 cases less than 20 ng / ml and 87 cases exceeding 20 ng / ml . The original H & E slides of all specimens were re - examined by pathologists ( ﬁ gure 1 , panels A , E and I ; ﬁ gure 2 , panels A , E , I and M ; ﬁ gure 3 , panels A , E , I and J ) . In all , 30 cases had a Gleason score of 4 – 6 ( score 4 in one case who had undergone suprapubic transvesical prostatectomy , score 5 in three cases who had undergone TURP , score 6 in 26 cases from biopsy samples and TURP ) , 38 cases had a Gleason score of 7 and 42 cases had a Gleason score of 8 – 10 . Pelvic lymph node metastasis was found in four patients at the time of surgery . The distribution of Tumor , Node , Metastasis ( TNM ) stage in all PCa specimens was as follows : T1 in 23 cases , T2 in 32 cases , T3 in 46 cases and T4 in nine cases . In T3 and T4 stages , pathological parameters of invasion were including lymphovascular invasion , extracapsular invasion , seminal vesicle invasion and so on ; N0 in 106 cases and N1 in four cases ; and M0 in 105 cases and M1 in ﬁ ve cases ( table 1 ) . All survival time was calculated from biopsy or date of surgery to date of death . The time of last follow - up was 31 December 2011 . The median follow - up time was 30 . 0 months ( mean 32 . 8 months , range , 6 . 8 – 99 . 4 months ) . No patients were lost for insuf ﬁ cient data . Thirty - one patients died of PCa , and the survival rate was 71 . 8 % . Immunohistochemistry All specimens were formalin - ﬁ xed , paraf ﬁ n - embedded , and cut into 5 - mm - thick serial sections and were mounted on the 3 - - aminopropyl - triethoxysilane coated slides . Immunohistochemistry was performed using the MaxVision technique with a monoclonal mouse antihuman cortactin antibody ( diluted 1 : 300 ; Millipore Corporation , Bedford , Massachusetts , USA ) , a monoclonal rabbit antihuman SIRT2 antibody ( diluted 1 : 200 ; Millipore Corporation ) , a polyclonal goat antihuman HDAC6 antibody ( diluted 1 : 200 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , California , USA ) and biotin - labelled secondary immunoglobulins ( diluted 1 : 100 ; Dako Denmark A / S ( DAKO ) ) . Tissue sections were dewaxed in xylene , rehydrated in gradi - ent alcohol and immersed in 3 % hydrogen peroxide for 10 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity . For cortactin and SIRT2 staining , high pressure and temperature ( 100°C ) for 1 . 5 min with 0 . 01 mol / l sodium citrate buffer ( pH 6 ) were used for antigen retrieval according to the manufacturer ’ s instruction . For antigen retrieval of HDAC6 , sections were ﬁ rst pretreated in an autoclave for 10 min in EDTA solution ( 1 mmol / l pH 8 ) . After three rinses ( each for 5 min in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) ) , sections were incubated for an hour at room temperature with cortactin , SIRT2 and HDAC6 antibodies , respectively . The negative controls were set up by replacement of antibody with PBS solution . After three 5 - min washes in PBS , sections were incubated with biotin - labelled secondary immunoglobulins for 30 min at room temperature . After three additional washes , colour development was carried out in 3 , 3 0 - diaminobenzidine ( DAB ) based substrate . The sections were counter - stained with haematoxylin . Larynx squamous cell carcinoma , astrocytoma tissue or ER - positive and PR - positive breast cancer were used as positive controls . Immunostaining results in malignant , atypical or benign epithelium of prostate tissues were evaluated . The positive product of cortactin staining was assessed in the cell mem - brane or cytoplasm , and SIRT2 was assessed in the cytoplasm or nucleus . HDAC6 staining was assessed in the cytoplasm or nucleus . Five high power ﬁ elds of the section were observed , and the intensity of the immunostaining was rated on a scale with scores determined as 0 ( negative staining for aim cells ) , 1 + ( positive staining for 1 – 10 % aim cells ) , 2 + ( positive stain - ing for 11 – 50 % aim cells ) and 3 + ( positive staining for more than 50 % aim cells ) . And , thus , 1 + represented weak stain - ing , 2 + was moderate staining , 3 + was strong staining and 0 was negative staining . Categories were primarily based on median values , considering the frequency distribution for each marker ; categories with similar survival estimates were merged when appropriate . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using the Social Sciences Statistical package V . 13 . 0 ( SPSS , Inc . ) . A p value < 0 . 05 was considered signi ﬁ cant , and the non - parametric Spearman rank Correlation test was used to analyse the relationship among cortactin , SIRT2 and HDAC6 immunostaining expression . A χ 2 test ( linear - by - linear association ) was used to determine whether cortactin , SIRT2 and HDAC6 immunostaining corre - lated with clinicopathological parameters in patients with PCa . Group comparison was performed using a χ 2 test . In addition , cases that were included in the survival analysis were divided into four groups , re ﬂ ecting the four possible staining groups of 0 , 1 + , 2 + or 3 + , to allow comparison of survival time with cortactin , SIRT2 and HDAC6 immunostaining intensities . The survival time was evaluated using the Kaplan – Meier survival test , and survival rates were compared using the log - rank test . Multivariable survival analysis was performed using multifac - torial Cox regression analysis . RESULTS The association of cortactin expression with clinicopathological parameters in PCa The positive rates of cortactin expression were 79 . 1 % ( 87 / 110 ) , 53 . 6 % ( 37 / 69 ) and 22 . 1 % ( 17 / 77 ) in the cell membrane or cyto - plasm of aim cells in PCa foci , HGPIN foci and benign foci , respectively ( p < 0 . 01 ) ( table 2 ) . As for the staining intensity , strong signals of cortactin were detected in most cancerous glandular epithelia foci ( ﬁ gure 1 , panels B , F and J ) , while it was negative or weaker in HGPIN foci and benign foci of the samples . In PCa foci , staining intensity of cortactin signi ﬁ cantly corre - lated with higher Gleason score and advanced T and N stages ( ﬁ gure 2 , panels B , F , J and N ; ﬁ gure 3 , panels B , F and K ) ( p < 0 . 01 ) . Although there was no signi ﬁ cant correlation between the M1 and M0 stages in staining intensity of cortac - tin , an increased tendency in advanced M stage was still obvious . In addition , cortactin expression was signi ﬁ cantly higher in PCa patients with high serum PSA level ( ≥ 20 ng / ml ) compared with low levels ( p < 0 . 01 ) . There was no signi ﬁ cant difference between cortactin immunostaining intensity and age of patients with PCa ( p > 0 . 05 ) ( table 3 ) .

Compared with serum PSA levels < 20 ng / ml , SIRT2 expression was higher in PCa patients with serum PSA levels ≥ 20 ng / ml ( p < 0 . 01 ) . This pattern was uniform across age groups ( p < 0 . 05 ) ( table 4 ) . The association of HDAC6 expression with clinicopathological parameters in PCa Moderate positive staining of HDAC6 appeared in the cyto - plasm or nuclei in the foci of cancerous glandular epithelia of a few samples and its related benign foci , while in the accompan - ied HGPIN foci , it appeared as negative or weaker in the cyto - plasm ( ﬁ gure 1 , panels D , H and L ) .

Relationship among the expression of cortactin , SIRT2 , HDAC6 and survival time The 110 cases of PCa patients receiving 6 . 8 – 99 . 4 months follow - up were divided into four groups of negative , weak ( 1 + ) , moderate ( 2 + ) or strong staining ( 3 + ) based on the immu - nostaining intensities of cortactin , SIRT2 and HDAC6 . Survival analysis of the patients with PCa was performed using survival curves based on the Kaplan – Meier method ( ﬁ gure 4 , A B C ) . The results showed that cortactin expression were correlated with poor survival using a log - rank test ( χ 2 = 10 . 571 , p = 0 . 014 ) . Higher cortactin expression was asso - ciated with a poor prognosis . Using cortactin immunostaining as independent variables , the median survival time was 29 . 5 months . However , SIRT2 or / and HDAC6 immunostaining intensity did not correlate with cumulative survival rates of PCa patients ( SIRT2 , χ 2 = 5 . 769 , p = 0 . 123 ; HDAC6 , χ 2 = 1 . 715 , p = 0 . 634 ) . Notably , survivals in the 34 patients who coex - pressed cortactin and SIRT2 were worse in comparison with the cases of single positive or double negative ( χ 2 = 5 . 881 , p = 0 . 015 ) , and the four PCa patients who coexpressed cortac - tin , SIRT2 and HDAC6 did not show difference in cumulative survival rates compared with other patterns of mixed positive and / or negative expression because of insuf ﬁ cient samples ( Log - rank test , χ 2 = 1 . 624 , p = 0 . 202 ) . Multivariable regression analysis We initially screened for the following as possible prognosis factors : age , serum PSA level , Gleason score , clinical TNM stages , cortactin , SIRT2 and HDAC6 immunostaining . In the Cox model , the likelihood ratio was χ 2 = 26 . 041 and p < 0 . 01 . In multivariable regression analysis , when only cortactin expres - sion was considered , the yield HR of progression associated with increased cortactin expression was 2 . 089 ( coef ﬁ cient of regression β , 0 . 736 ; SE , 0 . 215 ; Wald value , 11 . 772 ; 95 % CIs for Exp ( β ) were 1 . 371 to 3 . 181 ; p = 0 . 001 ) . Cortactin expression was a signi ﬁ cant prognostic factor for the survival of patients with PCa , suggesting cortactin to be an independent prognostic marker of prostate tumour progression . DISCUSSION Invasion and metastasis are the distinctive clinical features in all malignancies ; the motility of the tumour cells is the key determinants in this process . Almost all cellular components involved in the cell migration are associated with tumour metastases . 28 Cortactin , which plays an important role in regu - lating cell motility , has come into the vision and has been intensively investigated recently . 7 8 Recent studies have reported that the overexpression of cor - tactin correlates with pathological grading , clinical staging and survival rate in several human cancers . 18 – 21 23 25 Gibcus et al 19 demonstrated in a cohort of 106 cases of laryngeal squamous carcinoma that high level cortactin expression might accelerate the progression in primary lesions and lymph nodes metastasis , and multivariable Cox analysis showed that the cortactin expression status was the independent risk factor . However , up to date , little is known about the signi ﬁ cance of cortactin expression in human PCa . In the present study , we for the ﬁ rst time investigated its value in PCa prognosis and analysed the possible role of HDACs family members in this process . As has been expected , the results showed that high cortactin expres - sion was seen in PCa ( 79 . 1 % ) than that in accompanied HGPIN and benign lesions . A tendency was apparent that the enhancement of cortactin expression is related to the progres - sion of the lesions from benign , HGPIN and PCa , which Table 5 Association between HDAC6 immunostaining and clinicopathological features in 110 patients with prostate cancer Positive staining cases ( % ) * Negative staining cases ( % ) Weak staining ( 1 + ) Moderate staining ( 2 + ) Strong staining ( 3 + ) χ 2 Value p Value Age ( year ) < 70 83 . 3 ( 35 / 42 ) 16 . 7 ( 7 / 42 ) 0 0 2 . 030 0 . 154 ≥ 70 80 . 9 ( 55 / 68 ) 14 . 7 ( 10 / 68 ) 1 . 5 ( 1 / 68 ) 2 . 9 ( 2 / 68 ) PSA ( ng / ml ) < 20 78 . 3 ( 18 / 23 ) 21 . 7 ( 5 / 23 ) 0 0 0 . 000 1 . 000 ≥ 20 82 . 8 ( 72 / 87 ) 13 . 8 ( 12 / 87 ) 1 . 1 ( 1 / 87 ) 2 . 3 ( 2 / 87 ) Gleason score ≤ 6 86 . 7 ( 26 / 30 ) 10 ( 3 / 30 ) 3 . 3 ( 1 / 30 ) 0 5 . 537 0 . 019 7 84 . 2 ( 32 / 38 ) 15 . 8 ( 6 / 38 ) 0 0 ≥ 8 76 . 2 ( 32 / 42 ) 19 ( 8 / 42 ) 0 4 . 8 ( 2 / 42 ) CS ( TNM ) T stage T1 82 . 6 ( 19 / 23 ) 13 ( 3 / 23 ) 0 4 . 3 ( 1 / 23 ) 0 . 755 0 . 385 T2 81 . 3 ( 26 / 32 ) 15 . 6 ( 5 / 32 ) 3 . 1 ( 1 / 32 ) 0 T3 84 . 8 ( 39 / 46 ) 13 ( 6 / 46 ) 0 2 . 2 ( 1 / 46 ) T4 66 . 7 ( 6 / 9 ) 33 . 3 ( 3 / 9 ) 0 0 N stage N0 84 ( 89 / 106 ) 13 . 2 ( 14 / 106 ) 1 ( 1 / 106 ) 1 . 9 ( 2 / 106 ) 45 . 391 0 . 000 N1 25 ( 1 / 4 ) 75 ( 3 / 4 ) 0 0 M stage M0 81 ( 85 / 105 ) 16 . 2 ( 17 / 105 ) 0 0 17 . 862 0 . 000 M1 100 ( 5 / 5 ) 0 0 0 * χ 2 Test ( linear - by - linear association ) .

And higher cortactin immunostaining intensity was signi ﬁ cantly associated with higher Gleason score , clinical stage progression and PSA level . In addition , the results of Kaplan – Meier curves and the Log - rank analysis indi - cated that higher cortactin expression was signi ﬁ cantly corre - lated with shorter survival time and worse prognosis . Importantly , cortactin is an independent factor for survival of patients with PCa among markers expression , Gleason score , clinical TNM stage , PSA level and age based on multivariable Cox regression analysis , which is consistent with the results of Gibcus and coworkers , 19 and suggests that cortactin may be a sensitive and independent predicative marker of PCa in general signi ﬁ cance . The role of cortactin in promoting cell migration was consid - ered by its hypoacetylated status , hypoacetylated cortactin can enhance its F - actin binding ability , so to modulate the remodel - ling of the actin cytoskeleton and effect on cell migration , motility and adhesion , as well as on tumour invasion and metastasis . 6 Importantly , the deacetylation of cortactin was accomplished by the effect of HDAC family members . 29 30 HDAC6 as a major component was ascribed in this process in in vitro studies . 31 Sou č ek et al 10 have directly observed that HDAC6 can promote the deacetylation of cortactin in prostate epithelial cell lines with variable status , and enhanced the motility of both androgen - dependent and independent PCa cell lines . But , noticeably , the results from the in situ human PCa tissue were inconsistent with that mentioned above ; in our study , only a ﬁ fth of the cortactin positive PCa samples expressed HDAC6 , and there were no correlation of the HDAC6 expression in PCa , HGPIN and benign prostate tissue . Although the positive rate of HDAC6 expression in the PCa was signi ﬁ cantly low , it was associated with the Gleasion score and the lymph nodes metastasis , and there were no correlation among age , PSA level prior operation , clinical stages and sur - vival . Since the lesions including all of PCa , HGPIN and BHP expressed HADC6 in a substantial low rate , it was hard to take it as a meaningful biomarker . However , the expression of SIRT2 , the class III members of HDACs family , showed signi ﬁ - cant correlation with the expression of cortactin in PCa , and the 37 . 7 % of the PCa samples were SIRT2 positive , which was higher than that expressed in accompanied HGPIN and benign prostate tissue . There was an increment tendency of SIRT2 expression in PCa as the Gleason scores and clinical stages pushed upwards . This result motivated us to think that there was the possibility that SIRT2 instead of HADC6 may in ﬂ u - ence tumour progression by altering the status of cortactin . As mentioned early , it has been generally considered that cortactin is a substrate of HDACs and more study in vitro showed HDAC6 was closely associated with the cortactin deacetylatio - nis . 10 There also were reports that HDAC6 and SIRT2 can interact to deacetylate lysine residues within a - tubulin and overexpression of HDAC6 , SIRT2 and cortactin seen in ovarian cancer , 31 while SIRT2 that dominated in PCa in situ like in the present study was scarce . The possible explanation was that the discrepancy of the ﬁ ndings indicated that any given members of HADCs family interacting with their cortactin substrate may depend on the unique tumour type and tumour microenvironment . But to note , no matter which member it is , the HADCs family was associated with deacetylated cortactin mediated enhancement of tumour cell motile and invasive . 32 In summary , cortactin displayed signi ﬁ cantly elevated expres - sion in PCa . The overexpression of cortactin was correlated with invasion , metastasis and poorer patient survival times . Higher cortactin expression may be linked to an increased SIRT2 expression in PCa . Cortactin seems to be a new inde - pendent prognostic marker for PCa , and a correlation between cortactin and SIRT2 may predict disease progression and con - tribute to more accurate evaluations of the progression of PCa . HDAC6 may be not responsible for abnormally contactin expression caused progression of PCa in situ . Take - home messages ▸ Cortactin seems to be a satisfactory marker to predict tumour progression and survival in cases of prostate cancer ( PCa ) . ▸ SIRT2 may be responsible for tumour occurrence and the progression of PCa . ▸ Histone deacetylase 6 is not responsible for tumour occurrence and the progression of PCa .
