Research Article 1533 Introduction Actin filaments can assemble into diverse structures such as lamellipodia , filopodia or stress fibers . These structures in turn provide protrusive and contractile forces during cell polarization , migration and division , and are central to many physiological and pathological processes such as differentiation , wound healing or malignant transformation . The driving force behind the often highly dynamic behavior of cortical actin is a combination of polymerization , depolymerization and myosin - dependent motility of actin filaments . Polymerization of actin filaments relies on a variety of nucleation factors . Among the different types of nucleators , formins constitute the largest class . In addition to their nucleation activity , formins also have the ability to promote actin filament elongation . This dual function might explain why they have diverged so extensively ( Chalkia et al . , 2008 ) . Formins support actin polymerization in vitro at rates of up to 10 subunits / second at 1  M G - actin ( Kovar and Pollard , 2004 ) . By contrast , studies in a range of organisms indicate that formins facilitate in vivo rates of actin polymerization of more than 550 subunits / second or 1 . 5  m / second ( Higashida et al . , 2004 ; Diez et al . , 2005 ; Staiger et al . , 2009 ) . Importantly , although we understand formin biochemistry in great detail ( Kovar , 2006 ; Paul and Pollard , 2009 ) , it has not been possible to link the elongation rate of a defined actin filament or bundle to the action of a particular formin in vivo . Myosin motors also contribute to actin remodeling by moving filaments past one another or along fixed substrates . The generation and role of myosin - II - dependent contractile forces during muscle contraction ( Yanagida , 2007 ) and cytokinesis ( Wang , 2001 ; Wu et al . , 2006 ; Clayton et al . , 2010 ; Skau and Kovar , 2010 ) have been intensely studied . Myosin II has also been implicated in retrograde actin flow in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Huckaba et al . , 2006 ) . Although there are several reports suggesting that unconventional myosins could move actin filaments along the cell cortex , no direct evidence for such a function has yet been presented . Considering the ability of all myosins to move actin filaments in in vitro gliding assays , and the association of many myosins with the plasma membrane ( Zot and Pollard , 1993 ; Sousa and Cheney , 2005 ; McConnell and Tyska , 2007 ) , this is quite remarkable . The budding yeast S . cerevisiae has been an invaluable model system for the study of molecular components and mechanisms regulating formin - dependent actin assembly ( Evangelista et al . , 2002 ; Sagot et al . , 2002 ; Moseley and Goode , 2006 ) . Actin cables in S . cerevisiae are linear filamentous structures generated by the two formins , Bni1 and Bnr1 . Bni1 localizes to the bud tip during polarized growth and nucleates short , bud - localized cables . During cytokinesis Bni1 relocates to the bud neck , where it supports assembly of cables and , possibly , the acto - myosin ring ( Evangelista et al . , 2002 ; Buttery et al . , 2007 ) . Bnr1 is immobilized at the bud neck by interactions with septins , and nucleates cables that project into the mother cell ( Buttery et al . , 2007 ) . Polarized cables are used as tracks for myosin - V - driven vectorial transport , which is essential for cell growth and homeostasis ( Jansen et al . , 1996 ; Pruyne et al . , 1998 ) . Although actin cables are highly dynamic ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ; Karpova et al . , 1998 ) , previous studies have focused on relatively slow actin dynamics displayed by polarized cells ( Yang and Pon , 2002 ; Huckaba et al . , 2006 ) . Dynamics of cables in unpolarized cells and during cell polarization remained uncharacterized . Furthermore , the molecular mechanisms driving cable dynamics remain unknown . Here , we use total internal reflection microscopy ( TIRFM ) to quantify and compare cable dynamics in unpolarized and polarized cells . Combining quantitative image - analyses with genetic manipulations , we probe the molecular basis for the observed dynamics . Summary Cell morphogenesis requires complex and rapid reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton . The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an invaluable model system for studying molecular mechanisms driving actin dynamics . Actin cables in yeast are formin - generated linear actin arrays that serve as tracks for directed intracellular transport by type V myosins . Cables are constantly reorganized throughout the cell cycle but the molecular basis for such dynamics remains poorly understood . By combining total internal reflection microscopy , quantitative image analyses and genetic manipulations we identify kinetically distinct subpopulations of cables that are differentially driven by formins and myosin . Bni1 drives elongation of randomly oriented actin cables in unpolarized cells , whereas both formins Bnr1 and Bni1 mediate slower polymerization of cables in polarized cells . Type V myosin Myo2 surprisingly acts as a motor for translational cable motility along the cell cortex . During polarization , cells change from fast to slow cable dynamics through spatio - temporal regulation of Bni1 , Bnr1 and Myo2 . In summary , we identify molecular mechanisms for the regulation of cable dynamics and suggest that fast actin reorganization is necessary for fidelity of cell polarization .

By employing TIRFM actin , structures labeled by Abp140 – GFP could be visualized with improved sensitivity ( Fig . 1A ) . Due to the limited illumination depth of TIRFM ( Axelrod et al . , 1983 ) , we had to ensure that actin cables were associated with the cell cortex as previously reported ( Amberg , 1998 ) . We therefore analyzed Z - stacks of Abp140 – GFP - labeled yeast cells using wide - field microscopy ( Fig . 1B ) , and counted an average of 6 . 6±2 . 1 ( mean ± s . d . , n  51 ) cables for each mother cell or unbudded cell analyzed . Cables in small and medium - sized buds were hardly visible and were therefore not included for quantitative analyses . Importantly , nearly all cables ( n  336 ) were found restricted to the cortical planes with only 1 . 2 % extending into the interior of cells ( Fig . 1B ) . Our results indicate that TIRFM is a reliable technique for monitoring actin cable dynamics in S . cerevisiae cells . Actin cable dynamics are tightly regulated during cell polarization To characterize cable dynamics in detail we followed individual cables moving through the field of view . Actin cables were rarely static and often either exhibited elongation ( Fig . 2A ; supplementary material Movie 1 ) or translational motility ( Fig . 2B ; supplementary material Movie 2 ) . Due to the illumination limit of TIRFM and the oval shape of S . cerevisiae cells , only 50 – 70 % of the surface area of a cellular hemisphere could be visualized ( field of view with 2 – 5  m diameter ) . However , most actin cables extended beyond the field of view at one or both ends and it was often impossible to directly distinguish elongation from translational motility . Following reliable fiduciary marks on cables was not feasible because Abp140 has very low affinity to actin filaments and exchanges on cables within less than 200 milliseconds ( supplementary material Fig . S1A ) ( Riedl et al . , 2008 ) . We therefore 1534 Journal of Cell Science 124 ( 9 ) Fig . 1 . Cortical actin cable network in S . cerevisiae cells .

J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e defined all extensions of leading cable ends as ‘cable movement’ and attempted to separate kinetic subpopulations of cables by careful quantification and statistics . To this end , we analyzed the measured velocities by kernel density estimation and plotted their probability density functions . This approach allows a smoothed representation of the raw data distribution and is considered superior to histograms ( see Materials and Methods for details ) . In addition , we recorded the number of cables moving through the field of view as a measure for cable abundance and turnover in a cell . In unbudded cells with no observable polarized cable arrays ( referred to hereafter as unpolarized cells ; supplementary material Fig . S1B ) we observed rapid cable movement with velocities up to 5  m / second with probability densities peaking around 1 . 2  m / second and 2 . 2  m / second ( Fig . 2C ; supplementary material Fig . S2A ) . In small or medium - budded cells ( bud diameter less than half of mother diameter , referred to hereafter as polarized cells ; supplementary material Fig . S1C ) , cable movement was overall slower with a single peak around 1  m / second ( Fig . 2C ; supplementary material Fig . S2A ) . For simplicity , cable movement measurements were separated into three velocity categories : slow , below 1  m / second ; intermediate , between 1 and 2  m / second ; and fast , above 2  m / second . These were plotted into stacked bar graphs and used to supplement the kernel density analyses . In polarized cells , a reduction of fast movements and increase in slow movements was clearly observed ( Fig . 2D ) . In addition , the number of emerging cables was significantly reduced in polarized cells ( 10 . 7±3 . 5 cables / minute , mean ± s . d . , n  20 ) compared to unpolarized cells ( 24 . 5±5 . 8 cables / minute , n  20 ; Fig . 2G ) . These data suggested a decrease in cable dynamics upon cell polarization . To verify this in a synchronous cell population undergoing polarization , we introduced Abp140 – GFP into a strain that could be arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle by cyclin depletion ( Richardson et al . , 1989 ; Wedlich - Soldner et al . , 2004 ) . Cable dynamics were then measured before and after synchronous release of cells from the G1 cell cycle arrest . Confirming our previous measurements , cable movement velocities and cable numbers were reduced as cells became polarized ( Fig . 2E , F ) . This effect became most pronounced after 80 minutes when most cells had already established polarity ( Wedlich - Soldner et al . , 2004 ) and formed small buds ( Fig . 2E , insets ) . Cortical Bni1 drives rapid assembly of unpolarized actin cables Actin cables in S . cerevisiae were reported to depend on formin activity and we confirmed by TIRFM that cables were absent in cells lacking both formins ( bnr1  bni1 - 11 ; supplementary material Fig . S3A ) ( Evangelista et al . , 2002 ) or the essential formin cofactor profilin ( pfy1 - 4 ; supplementary material Fig . S3A ) ( Wolven et al . , 2000 ) . We then studied cable dynamics in individual formin knockout mutants . In unpolarized bni1  cells , cable numbers were reduced by 90 % ( Fig . 3A ) . Interestingly , we also observed a selective reduction of cable movement at intermediate velocities ( Fig . 3B , C ) . On the other hand , in unpolarized bnr1  cells , cable numbers were only reduced by 24 % ( Fig . 3A ) and cable movement velocities remained largely unchanged with a slight reduction of the slow population ( Fig . 3B , C ) . These results suggest that Bni1 generates most of the cables in unpolarized cells and regulates cable movement at 1535 Actin cable dynamics in S . cerevisiae Fig . 3 .

( G , H )  Cable movement rates in bnr1  cells treated with indicated concentrations of LatB . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e intermediate velocities between 1 and 2  m / second . Bnr1 , by contrast , plays a minor role at this stage and might be associated with slow movement below 1  m / second . To mechanistically understand cable movement we wanted to directly link cable movements at intermediate velocities to Bni1 - driven actin polymerization . Both Bni1 and Bnr1 contain formin homology 1 ( FH1 ) and FH2 domains ( Evangelista et al . , 2002 ) . FH2 binds to the barbed end of the actin filament , whereas FH1 recruits profilin - bound actin via polyproline tracks ( PPT ) ( Kovar , 2006 ) . It was previously reported that the number of PPTs in truncated constructs determined the rate of filament elongation by Bni1 in vitro ( Paul and Pollard , 2008 ) . We attempted to reproduce this result in cells . Therefore , the genomic copy of BNI1 was modified in a bnr1  background to either contain four ( wild type ) or only one PPT . This modification did not affect cable numbers ( Fig . 3A ) , in accordance with in vitro results where nucleation efficiency was unaffected ( Paul and Pollard , 2008 ) . However , compared to cells expressing Bni1 - 4PPT , we found a clear and selective shift of the velocity population associated with Bni1 in cells expressing bni1 - 1PPT ( Fig . 3D , peak from 1 . 4  m / second to 1  m / second ; Fig . 3E ) . This result confirms the dependence of intermediate cable movement velocities on Bni1 and also corroborated the reduced polymerization rates with fewer PPTs in vitro ( Paul and Pollard , 2008 ) . Because actin cables were localized predominantly at the cell cortex ( Fig . 1B ) , Bni1 had to also localize to the cell cortex to regulate cable dynamics . Indeed , previous data suggested that formins were activated by membrane association ( Dong et al . , 2003 ) . However , only cytosolic Bni1 dots had been observed in unpolarized cells so far ( Buttery et al . , 2007 ) . No clear evidence of cortical localization of Bni1 in these cells was reported . Taking advantage of the increased sensitivity of our setup we now monitored Bni1 – GFP localization in unpolarized cells by TIRFM . We found that Bni1 – GFP transiently accumulated in cortical patches that were distinct from endocytic actin patches ( supplementary material Fig . S3B , C ) . Importantly , using dual - color TIRFM with Bni1 – GFP and Abp140 – RFP we observed short actin cables originating from cortical Bni1 patches ( Fig . 3F ) . In summary , we propose that cortical Bni1 contributes to cable dynamics in unpolarized cells by driving filament elongation at intermediate velocities of 1 – 2  m / second . Cortical Myo2 drives rapid cable motility in unpolarized cells Remarkably , none of the formin mutations resulted in a reduction of the cable population moving faster than 2  m / second ( Fig . 3B – E ) , suggesting that these movements might occur independently of actin polymerization . To verify this , we treated bnr1  cells with latrunculin B ( LatB ) , which specifically inhibits actin polymerization by sequestering actin monomers ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) . At increasing LatB concentrations , cables became diminished until they disappeared completely in 16  M LatB ( supplementary material Fig . S3D ) . In cells treated with 2 – 8  M LatB , actin cables became shorter and underwent rapid translational motility ( supplementary material Movie 3 ) . This movement mostly occurred at rates above 2  m / second ( Fig . 3G , H ) . These results strongly suggest that translational cable motility was mechanistically distinct from formin - driven cable elongation and occurred at higher speed . The initial double - peak distribution ( Fig . 2C ) could have resulted from the combination of these mechanisms . In S . cerevisiae the only previously reported process occurring at velocities above 2  m / second is intracellular transport by the type V myosin Myo2 ( Schott et al . , 2002 ; Sheltzer and Rose , 2009 ) . Therefore , we monitored cable dynamics in unpolarized cells of various myo2 mutants . The temperature - sensitive mutant myo2 - 66 is defective in actin binding ( Johnston et al . , 1991 ) , whereas the myo2 - 16 mutant ( Schott et al . , 1999 ) has a defect in cargo binding . At restrictive temperature ( 36°C ) , cable numbers in cells of either mutant were not affected ( Fig . 4A ) . Strikingly , populations of cables moving above 2  m / second were strongly reduced for both mutants ( Fig . 4B – E ) . This became especially apparent in bni1  myo2 - 16 double mutant cells . In these cells , the cable number was reduced by 73 % ( Fig . 4A ) , similar to the bni1  mutant ( Fig . 3A ) . Notably , over 70 % of the remaining cables now moved with velocities below 1  m / second ( Fig . 4D , E ) , consistent with the loss of both Bni1 - mediated ( 1 – 2  m / second ) and Myo2 - mediated ( above 2  m / second ) movements . Moreover , cables in myo2 mutant cells frequently became immobile for extended periods ( Fig . 4H ) , compared to rapid continuous motility in the control strain ( Fig . 2B , supplementary material Movie 3 ) . Disruption of any other S . cerevisiae myosin ( Myo4 , Myo1 , Myo3 + 5 ) did not cause any reduction of cable movement in unpolarized cells ( supplementary material Fig . S4A , B ) indicating a specific role of Myo2 in this process . Both myo2 - 16 and myo2 - 66 alleles lead to cell lethality at the restrictive temperature ( Johnston et al . , 1991 ; Schott et al . , 1999 ) . To rule out secondary physiological defects as the cause of changes in cable dynamics , we wanted to directly link the motor activity of Myo2 to cable motility . To this end , we measured cable dynamics in Myo2 mutants containing different numbers of IQ motifs in their neck domain . Previous study showed that stepwise reduction of IQ motifs from six ( wild type ) to zero might reduce myosin step size , causing progressive slow - down of Myo2 - dependent transport of secretory vesicles ( Schott et al . , 2002 ) . Consistently , after reduction of IQ motifs , the population of cables moving at velocities above 2  m / second was progressively reduced in our TIRFM assay ( Fig . 4F , G ) . Because actin cables localized predominantly close to the plasma membrane ( Fig . 1B ) ( Amberg , 1998 ) , Myo2 had to be anchored at the cell cortex to mediate cable movement . Using dual - color TIRFM we showed that Myo2 – GFP formed relatively static cortical Myo2 patches ( Fig . 4I ) , which were distinct from actin patches ( supplementary material Fig . S4C ) . These colocalized with actin cables along the path of translational motility ( Fig . 4J ) . Our results demonstrate that Myo2 not only functions as a cargo motor using actin cable as tracks , but also functions as the motor for translational cable movement along the cell cortex . Bnr1 and Bni1 govern actin cable dynamics in polarized mother cells We identified Bni1 and Myo2 as molecules driving cable movement above 1  m / second in unpolarized cells . What then mediated slow cable movement below 1  m / second ? Our measurements showed only a few cables in this range in unpolarized cells , and lack of Bnr1 specifically abolished these cables ( Fig . 3B , C ) . By contrast , slower cable movements were much more prominent in polarized mother cells , with half of the cables moving below 1  m / second ( Fig . 2C – F ) . The activity profile of Bnr1 closely correlated with the observed differences in cable movement [ high activity in polarized cells ( Pruyne et al . , 2004a ) , low activity in unpolarized 1536 Journal of Cell Science 124 ( 9 ) J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e cells ( Chesarone et al . , 2009 ) ] . We therefore suspected that Bnr1 mediated cable movement below 1  m / second . To test our hypothesis , we studied cable dynamics in polarized mother cells of formin mutants . Deletion of Bni1 caused no change in cable numbers ( Fig . 5A ) but nearly completely abolished cable movement above 1  m / second ( Fig . 5B , C ) . Almost all cables were now polarized towards the bud neck ( Fig . 5D ) , where Bnr1 was reportedly localized ( Fig . 5E ) ( Buttery et al . , 2007 ) . Surprisingly , cable number and movement remained largely unaffected by deletion of Bnr1 ( Fig . 5A – C ) , but more than 40 % of the cables were now depolarized ( Fig . 4D ) . These randomly oriented cables moved significantly faster than polarized cables ( 1 . 4±0 . 74  m / second vs 0 . 94±0 . 6  m / second , P < 0 . 001 ; Fig . 4F , G ) . Notably , rapid cable motility above 2  m / second was absent from all polarized cells ( Fig . 5B , C ) indicating a negligible role of Myo2 - driven cable movement . In agreement with this , Myo2 – GFP was mostly found at the bud tips of polarized cells ( Fig . 5H ) ( Lillie and Brown , 1994 ) , whereas cortical density of Myo2 patches was significantly reduced in polarized mother cell compared to unpolarized cells ( Fig . 5I ; P < 0 . 0005 ) . In summary , our results suggest that cable dynamics in polarized cells are predominantly mediated by the two formins Bni1 and Bnr1 . Bud - neck - confined Bnr1 was associated with elongation of polarized cables at rates below 1  m / second . Bni1 appeared to drive slow elongation of polarized cables ( < 1  m / second ) as well as elongation of unpolarized cables at intermediate speeds ( 1 – 2  m / second ) . This model is consistent with the concentration of Bni1 at bud tips and necks of polarized cells ( Fig . 5J ) ( Pruyne et al . , 2004a ) as well as transient localization of Bni1 on the mother cell cortex ( Fig . S3B ) ( Buttery et al . , 2007 ) . Myo2 - driven rapid cable motility ( > 2  m ) plays almost no role in cable dynamics at this stage . 1537 Actin cable dynamics in S . cerevisiae Fig . 4 .

J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e Cable dynamics are important for correct cell polarization Polarized transport into the bud requires stable arrays of actin cables ( Pruyne et al . , 2004b ) . Here , we established quantitatively that such arrays could be generated by oriented formation and immobilization of actin cables . However , the advantage of maintaining rapidly moving and randomly oriented cables in unpolarized cells was less obvious because this high energy - consuming process occurs before any polarized growth . Our results suggested that cells switch between fast and slow cable dynamics by activating Bnr1 at the bud neck . We therefore decided to observe cells that are forced to exclusively rely on Bnr1 - driven slow cable dynamics by either deleting the other formin or by removing the Bnr1 inhibitor Bud14 ( Chesarone et al . , 2009 ) . One possible role of rapid and random cable dynamics is to enable efficient cell polarity establishment , a self - organizing process that depends on rapid recycling of polarity regulators such as Rho - GTPase Cdc42 ( Wedlich - Soldner and Li , 2004 ) . Recycling of Cdc42 is mediated by a combination of actin - and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor ( GDI ) - dependent pathways ( Slaughter et al . , 2009 ) . We assayed cell polarization during bud formation by monitoring the localization of GFP – Cdc42 in synchronized cell populations released from G1 cell cycle arrest ( Wedlich - Soldner et al . , 2004 ) . To better discern defects in actin - mediated recycling , we deleted the S . cerevisiae GDI Rdi1 , which can extract Cdc42 from membranes ( Tiedje et al . , 2008 ) . We then tested the effect of Bni1 deletion on polarization . Although deletion of either Rdi1 or Bni1 led to no obvious defects , polarization was significantly delayed in the double mutant ( Fig . 6A ) . In addition , 5 % of all cells exhibited a striking phenotype with split caps or bifurcated buds ( Fig . 6B ) . Bud14 was first identified as a factor regulating various aspect of cell morphogenesis during vegetative growth and mating . Deletion of Bud14 led to defects in cell growth and to elongated cells that undergo pseudohyphal growth ( Cullen and Sprague , 2002 ) . It was recently shown that Bud14 regulates Bnr1 by displacing it from the barbed ends of actin filaments ( Chesarone et al . , 2009 ) . Without Bud14 , Bnr1 was expected to remain attached to newly generated actin cables . Here we show that , strikingly , Bnr1 – GFP , which could not be detected on the cortex of control unpolarized cells , formed polarized caps and dot - like cortical structures in unbudded bud14  cells ( Fig . 6C ) . This abnormal localization was also reflected in reduced rates of cable movement , consistent with the predicted Bnr1 - dependent slow cable dynamics ( Fig . 6D , E ) . These results indicate that cells with constantly activated Bnr1 and , hence , abnormally slow actin dynamics are not able to become depolarized . These constitutively polarized cells can only grow in a polarized manner throughout the cell cycle , resulting in abnormal cell morphology or pseudohyphal growth . Discussion In this study , we provide insights into the mechanisms underlying actin cable organization and dynamics via spatio - temporal patterning of formins and myosin . In unpolarized G1 cells , actin cables are randomly oriented and their polymerization is largely mediated by the cortical formin Bni1 ( Fig . 6F ) . The second formin , Bnr1 , plays only a minor role in unpolarized cells and is supposedly kept inactive by Bud14 . Cortical type V myosin Myo2 contributes to actin dynamics by mediating rapid sliding of actin cables along the plasma membrane . In polarized cells cable dynamics are significantly slowed down . Cables become mostly oriented towards the bud neck , where they are polymerized by bud - neck - confined Bnr1 . At the same time , Bni1 is recruited to the bud tip and bud neck , where it also participates in the generation of polarized cable array . Myo2 is depleted from the cell cortex and targeted to the bud by polarized transport ( Fig . 6F ) . We show that cables undergo growth and motility with velocities up to 5  m / second . Noticeably , even the slower cable movements in polarized cells were much faster than those reported previously ( 0 . 3 – 0 . 6  m / second ) ( Yang and Pon , 2002 ; Huckaba et al . , 2006 ) . The strain used in those previous studies also showed faster movement in our hands ( supplementary material Fig . S4A , B ) . A likely reason for this apparent discrepancy is the lower sensitivity of wide - field microscopy compared to TIRFM ( Fig . 1A ) . Most cables seen by wide - field fluorescence were polarized cable bundles ( Fig . 1B ) , whereas TIRFM imaging additionally revealed many rapidly moving , unpolarized cables ( Fig . 1A ; supplementary 1538 Journal of Cell Science 124 ( 9 ) Fig . 5 .

Patch number was then divided by the area of the field of view ( in   m 2 ) to yield the density ( * * * P < 0 . 0005 compared with unpolarized cells ) .

Also , the use of a highly sensitive EMCCD camera enabled us to achieve higher temporal resolution in our sequences . These allowed us to study cables moving faster than 1  m / second , which were probably underrepresented in previous studies . It was previously shown that the two yeast formins , Bni1 and Bnr1 , differ in their interaction partners and localization patterns ( Dong et al . , 2003 ; Moseley and Goode , 2005 ; Buttery et al . , 2007 ; Chesarone et al . , 2009 ) . We now present evidence suggesting that they also assemble kinetically separable cable populations in a cell cycle - dependent manner . Bni1 was the dominant player in cable assembly in unpolarized G1 cells ( Fig . 3A – F ) , whereas Bnr1 only became localized and / or activated during bud formation ( Fig . 5A – E ) . Importantly , altered cable dynamics in several formin mutants suggested that Bni1 might polymerize actin cables twice as fast as Bnr1 . This notion was supported by the velocity peaks at 1 . 2 – 1 . 5  m / second in cells containing Bni1 as the only formin ( Fig . 3B , D , G ) , and the peaks appearing faithfully at 0 . 5 – 0 . 7  m / second in bni1  or Bnr1 hyperactivation strains ( Fig . 3B , Fig . 4D , Fig . 6D ) . Another major difference was that Bnr1 - generated cables were uniformly polarized towards the bud neck – the place of their origin , whereas even in polarized cells the Bni1 - nucleated cables were frequently randomly oriented ( Fig . 5D ) . This could be explained by a higher affinity of Bnr1 to actin barbed ends , consistent with a tenfold higher affinity of Bnr1 in biochemical experiments ( Moseley and Goode , 2005 ) as well as the presence of Bni1 outside polarized sites ( supplementary material Fig . S3B ) ( Buttery et al . , 2007 ) . In summary , we identified the switch between the two yeast formins as a major mechanism for regulation of cable dynamics . Our TIRFM - based cable dynamics measurements were sensitive enough to detect the effect of specific manipulation of the Bni1 - FH1 domain on actin polymerization in vivo . Previously , Paul and Pollard demonstrated that by reducing the number of PPT from four to one , polymerization rate by Bni1 is reduced by about 50 % ( Paul and Pollard , 2008 ) . We introduced these FH1 mutations into endogenously expressed Bni1 and found a clear shift of Bni1 - dependent cable movements from around 1 . 4  m / second to around 1 . 0  m / second , with no major changes in Myo2 - driven rapid motility ( Fig . 3D , E ) . Therefore the trend of the in vitro measurements could be reproduced faithfully , indicating that TIRFM - based observations of in vivo cable kinetics could be used to directly study the biochemical mechanisms of actin polymerization . Type V myosins are well known for their role in polarized transport of various cargos ( Pruyne et al . , 2004b ; Trybus , 2008 ) . We describe here a surprising novel role for Myo2 in moving actin filaments along the cell cortex . In unpolarized cells , sliding of cables by Myo2 allowed continuous movement and mixing of cables along the periphery of the cell . To our knowledge , this is also the first demonstration of a myosin moving actin filaments at the cortex . In polarized cells , cables formed polarized arrays that were probably anchored to the bud neck and could not be moved by Myo2 ( Fig . 5D ) . In this scenario , we expect myosin molecules 1539 Actin cable dynamics in S . cerevisiae Fig . 6 . Actin cable dynamics is tightly coupled to cell polarization . ( A )  Efficiency of cell polarization in cells defective in cable dynamics . Cell polarization was monitored using GFP – Cdc42 . Cells are considered polarized if they contain concentrated GFP fluorescence ( polar caps ) on the cell periphery . Shown here are the fractions of polarized cells in control ( RWS120 ) , bni1  ( JYY215 ) , rdi1  ( RWS150 ) and bni1  rdi1  ( JYY216 ) strains at different times after release from G1 arrest . Error bars show means ± s . d . , n  3 experiment with 50 cells each . Cell periphery is marked by a dotted line . ( B )  Formation of a single polarization cap in an rdi1  cell and split caps / buds in bni1  rdi1  cells .

( F )  Schematic model for actin cable regulation by spatial - temporal patterning of Bni1 , Bnr1 and Myo2 in unpolarized and polarized S . cerevisiae cells . Scale bars : 2   m . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e to be removed from the cortex ( Fig . 5I ) and move along the stable cables to the bud , where they can support polarized organelle transport ( Pruyne et al . , 2004b ) . This dual function of Myo2 as a motor that moves both cargos and tracks provides an efficient mechanism of adaptation to cell cycle - specific requirements . Assembly and rapid reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is clearly required for migration of amoeba and mammalian cells ( Bretschneider et al . , 2002 ; Lammermann et al . , 2008 ) . It is less clear why S . cerevisiae , a unicellular fungus enclosed in a cell wall , expends so much effort on keeping actin cables highly dynamic in unpolarized cells . We have shown here that reduction of cable motility can have serious consequences for polarity establishment . In cells ( bni1  ) that rely on slower cable assembly driven by Bnr1 , polarization after G1 release was significantly delayed ( Fig . 6A ) and these cells often could not properly focus secretion on a single polarization site ( Fig . 6B ) . One possible explanation for this phenotype is that in bni1  cells all cables generated during polarization became stably anchored to the septin ring by Bnr1 ( Pruyne et al . , 2004a ) and served as fixed vectors for delivery of Cdc42 - containing vesicles ( Wedlich - Soldner et al . , 2003 ) . In cases where cables happened to lie on opposite sides of the septin ring , separate Cdc42 caps would be formed , giving rise to the observed split - bud phenotype . Deleting Bud14 , a negative regulator of Bnr1 , caused a severe slow - down of cable dynamics as well as untimely polarization of cells in G1 ( Fig . 6C – E ) . This illustrates the problems associated with overly stable actin cables . Rapid reorganization of cables might be necessary to enable a precise response during highly dynamic processes such as polarity establishment ( Wedlich - Soldner and Li , 2004 ; Brandman et al . , 2005 ) . Cells might not even be able to attain a non - polarized state without Bnr1 - inactivation and , hence , rapid cable reorganization . Materials and Methods Cell culture and yeast strains Unless otherwise stated , all cells were haploid , grown at room temperature ( 24°C ) and analyzed from logarithmically growing cultures . Standard media and genomic manip - ulation procedures ( Janke et al . , 2004 ) were used . To generate bni1 - 1PPT , a fragment of BNI1 ( 1927 – 5862 ) was cloned into plasmid pRS315 . The FH1 domain ( 3687 – 4056 ) was then replaced by a fragment encoding 1PPT as described ( Paul and Pollard , 2008 ) , Plasmids with intact FH1 ( 4PPT ) or 1PPT were linearized and integrated into the BNI1 locus of the bnr1  strain . All strains used in this study are listed in supplementary material Table S1 . Plasmid construction for actin cable markers To label actin cables with RFP we used the construct pRS315 - Abp140 ( 1 - 214 ) - mRFPruby , based on the pRS315 ( CEN , LEU2 ) plasmid . It contains the Abp140 promoter followed by the coding region for the N - terminal 214 amino acids of Abp140 , which was fused to the mRFPruby gene ( Fischer et al . , 2006 ) . The mRFPruby gene was amplified with primers 5 (cid:2) - GGATCCGGGTGCTGGTGCTGGTGCTGGTGC - TATGGGCAAGCTTACCATGGCCAG - 3 (cid:2) and 5 (cid:2) - GCGGCCGCTTAAGCGCCTGT - GCTATGTCTGCC - 3 (cid:2) . Expression of Abp140 ( 1 - 214 ) - mRFPruby from this plasmid labels actin more strongly than endogenous Abp140 , allowing the detection of cables in two color experiments . Microscopy All images were acquired on a custom TIRFM setup ( Till Photonics , Gräfelfing , Germany ) based on an automated iMic - stand and an Olympus 1 . 45 NA 100 (cid:3) objective . Lasers at 488 nm ( Coherent Sapphire 75 mW ) and 561 nm ( Cobolt Jive 75 mW ) were coupled through an AOTF and a galvanometer - driven scan head to adjust TIRF angles . Images were collected with an Andor iXON DU - 897 EMCCD camera at maximum gain after a 2 (cid:3) magnifying lens ( Andor , Belfast , N . Ireland ) . Acquisition was controlled by the Live Acquisition software package . Wide - field images were acquired using the same setup using 0° incidence angle for the laser . Z - sectioning was performed using the built - in nanodrive system in the iMic setup . The epifluorescence microscope used for counting cables ( Fig . 1B ) was a Zeiss Axio Imager A1 with a Zeiss 100 (cid:3) 1 . 45 NA objective coupled to an ASI MS - 2000 XYZ stage . Images were collected with an Andor iXON DU - 897 EMCCD camera after a 2 (cid:3) magnifying lens ( Zeiss ) and Metamorph software . Drug treatment and G1 cell cycle arrest Cells subjected to LatB treatment were grown in drug - containing media at room temperature for 30 – 45 minutes prior to imaging . For G1 arrest assay , cln - arrest cells ( Richardson et al . , 1989 ) were grown to OD 0 . 5 – 0 . 8 and arrested in synthetic dropout medium containing 3 mM methionine for 2 – 3 hours . Cells were then released by washing out the methionine . Cable dynamics were imaged before and after release in at least 10 cells per time point . Cell polarization was monitored by determining the percentage of cells exhibiting concentration polar cap of GFP – Cdc42 fluorescence on the plasma membrane . Measurement of cable movement Images were acquired in TIRF mode at 5 Hz . Cable ends were traced over at least two frames . Distance of cable movement was divided by elapsed time to obtain velocities . Kernel density estimation This technique is a non - parametric way of estimating the probability density function of a random variable and allows smoothing of a finite data set . It avoids the bias inherent in histograms when selecting bin size and endpoints . Kernel estimators smooth out the contribution of each observed data point over a local neighborhood of that data point . Here raw measurements of cable velocities were processed and plotted using the Gaussian kernel density function in MATLAB ( The MathWorks ) , given as : where p ( x ) is the probability density of events at a given velocity , n is the sample size and h is the bandwidth of the kernel . The bandwidth was estimated for each dataset as : where  is the estimated standard deviation of the dataset and Q . 75 and Q . 25 are its 75 % and 25 % quartiles , respectively . Image processing Unless specified otherwise , images are raw or inverted for visualization . For smoothening , images were convolved with a Gaussian kernel ( 1 3 1 ; 3 7 3 ; 1 3 1 ) . Iterative deconvolution was performed in Huygens ( Scientific Volume Imaging , Hilversum , The Netherlands ) . Point spread functions were calculated separately for 488 nm and 561 nm lasers , using 40 nm yellow – green fluorescent microbeads ( Invitrogen ) . Statistics All averages are given as geometric mean ± s . e . m . or s . d . P - values were calculated using the t - test ( Mann - Whitney ) in Prism ( GraphPad ) .
