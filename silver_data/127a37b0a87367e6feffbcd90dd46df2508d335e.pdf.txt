They remain viable in this state until nutrients become available again . How cells enter this protective survival state and what happens at a cellular and subcellular level is largely unknown . In this study , we used electron tomography to investigate the stress - induced ultrastructural changes in the cytoplasm of yeast cells . After ATP depletion , we observed a significant cytosolic compaction and an extensive cytoplasmic reorganization , as well as the emergence of distinct membrane - bound and membrane - less organelles . By using correlative light and electron microscopy ( CLEM ) , we further demonstrate that one of these membrane - less organelles is generated by the reversible polymerization into large bundles of filaments of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B ( eIF2B ) , an essential enzyme in the initiation of protein synthesis . The changes we observe are part of a stress - induced survival strategy , allowing yeast cells to save energy , protect proteins from degradation , and inhibit protein functionality by forming assemblies of said proteins . Marini , Nüske , Leng , Alberti , Pigino . 2 Introduction To survive in a constantly changing world , cells require mechanisms to cope with environmental fluctuations . For instance , the baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae responds to sudden changes in nutrient abundance by adjusting its metabolism and growth rate . Under starvation conditions , yeast proliferation is efficiently shut down in favor of an energy - saving state that allows the cells to remain viable on slow metabolic activity ( Werner - Washburne et al . , 1993 ; Choder , 1993 ; Ireland et al , 1994 ; Gray et al . , 2004 ) . However , the structural changes that happen in the cells upon entry in this energy - saving state remain unclear . The organization of the yeast cytoplasm is very dynamic and changes continuously , not only following the different stages of the cell cycle , but also in response to stress conditions such as heat shock , osmotic stress , and nutrient starvation ( Meaden et al , 1999 ; Winderickx et al . , 2003 ; Petrovska et al . , 2014 ; Mourão et al . , 2014 ; Munna et al . , 2015 ; Joyner et al . , 2016 ; Munder et al . , 2016 ) . The transition from a growing to a dormant state , induced through a severe lack of nutrients , is coupled to various physio - chemical changes , such as a lowered cytosolic pH , reduced cell volume and decreased molecule mobility in the cytoplasm ( Ashe et al . , 2000 ; Joyner et al . 2016 , Munder et al . , 2016 ) , as well as physiological changes , such as a reduction in protein synthesis and in enzymatic activities ( Werner - Washburne et al . , 1993 ; Gray et al . , 2004 ) . Since the majority of metabolic reactions and signaling processes take place in the cytoplasm , stress - induced changes in its physical and chemical properties might be required for the cell to transition into a survival state . However , how the cytoplasm reorganizes under sudden stress conditions is largely unclear and comprehensive structural investigations of cytoplasmic changes occurring are missing . Live - cell imaging has shown that several fluorescently tagged enzymes form assemblies in the cytoplasm of dormant cells ( Narayanaswamy et al . , 2009 ; Noree et al . , 2010 ; Liu , 2010 ; Petrovska et al . , 2014 ; Riback et al . , 2017 ; Prouteau et al . , 2017 ) . Electron microscopy imaging of three of these metabolic enzymes , cytidine triphosphate synthetase ( CtpS , Barry et al . , 2014 ) , glutamine synthetase ( Gln1 , Petrovska et al . , 2014 ) and target of rapamycin complex 1 ( TORC1 , Prouteau et al . , 2017 ) , revealed that they assemble into filaments and that the filaments organize in bundles , visible in fluorescence microscopy . In all three cases , the polymerization process is reversible , and it is coupled to the inactivation of the enzymatic Marini , Nüske , Leng , Alberti , Pigino . 3 activities . These findings suggest that this stress - induced polymerization could be a common mechanism to downregulate the activity of essential metabolic enzymes during adverse environmental conditions . In this study , we used electron tomography ( ET ) to investigate the reorganization of the cytoplasm of energy - depleted yeast cells , and we used correlative light and electron microscopy ( CLEM ) to study the behavior of the essential enzyme eIF2B ( eukaryotic translation Initiation Factor 2B ) , a guanine nucleotide exchange factor and key initiator of protein synthesis . We show that energy - depleted yeast cells undergo a dramatic reorganization of the cytoplasm that involves the formation of distinct membrane - bound and membrane - less organelles , along with an almost two - fold increase in macromolecular crowding . Our results show that eIF2B decamers self - assemble into ordered bundles of filaments . We propose that eIF2B compartmentalization upon energy depletion could be a mechanism to store and protect the enzyme from denaturation , disassembly or vacuolar degradation , and could possibly contribute to the downregulation of its enzymatic activity . These results are consistent with a model in which cytoplasmic reorganization and enzyme regulation via self - assembly is an important survival strategy that enable cells to cope with extreme environmental conditions and stress . Results Energy depletion is accompanied by a reorganization of storage and membrane lipids To investigate how the cytoplasm of energy - depleted yeast cells undergoes structural rearrangements , we have been mimicking sudden glucose starvation by feeding yeast cells with a non - hydrolyzable analogue of glucose , 2 - deoxyglucose , and by blocking mitochondrial respiration with antimycin drug , de facto depriving cells of any possible source of ATP . After 15 minutes of treatment , we cryo - fixed the cells by high - pressure freezing to ensure the rapid immobilization of all macromolecular components in the cytoplasm , thus avoiding potential structural alterations that might occur during the slower process of standard chemical fixation ( Frank , 2006 ) . Subsequently , we imaged 70 nm to 150 nm thick sections of control and energy depleted yeast cells by dual - axis electron tomography and reconstructed the tomographic volumes from the aligned tilted images . By comparing the ultrastructure of log - phase growing Marini , Nüske , Leng , Alberti , Pigino . 4 cells with energy depleted cells , we found pronounced structural modifications between the two conditions ( Figure 1 ; Video 1 for control ; Video 2 and 3 for energy depletion ) , as energy depletion was characterized by extensive rearrangements of many cytoplasmic components , in particular lipids . We observed an increased number of small cytoplasmic lipid droplets ( LDs ) , recognizable by their amorphous non - electron - dense content . They appeared fragmented and irregular ( Figure 1 , B and C ; Video 2 and 3 ) compared to the fewer and larger LDs visible in control cells ( Figure 1A ; Video 1 ) . The average LDs diameter in control cells was ~ 160 nm , with a measured area per vesicle of ~ 1 . 7 µm 2 . In energy - depleted cells , the diameter of lipid droplets was reduced to ~ 120 nm and the average area per vesicle to 0 . 9 µm 2 . Membrane lipids also underwent a great rearrangement through the accumulation of elongated membranous structures and the appearance of deep tonoplast invaginations in the cytoplasm ( Figure 1 , B and D ; Video 2 and 3 ) . The invaginations extended to 1 µm in length , with diameters ranging from 20 to 100 nm . Interestingly , in energy - depleted cells we also observed double - layered membrane vesicles containing mostly ribosomes ( Figure 1 , B and C ; Figure 4 , B - D ; Supplemental Figure S1 and Video 3 ) . These resembled autophagosome vesicles , sometimes captured in an open , pre - fusion conformation ( Figure 1 , B and C ) . These structures could indicate early steps of the autophagy process , a process that is constitutive in cells , and can also be induced by stress ( Noda and Ohsumi , 1998 ; Jin and Klionsky , 2014 ) . Ribosome density and distribution change in energy - deprived cells A previous study of energy - depleted yeast reported an increased mechanical stability of the cytoplasm and a ~ 7 % reduction in cell volume ( Munder et al . , 2016 ) . Based on these observations , it was proposed that macromolecular crowding increases in stressed yeast cells . However , a direct quantification of cytoplasm density was never obtained . Since ribosomes take up a significant fraction of the cellular interior ( Duncan and Hershey , 1983 ; Warner 1999 ) , an accurate quantification of ribosome density can be used to account for changes in cytoplasmic crowding . In order to use ribosome density to quantify macromolecular crowding , we first verified that ribosome number does not change significantly between log - phase growing and dormant ( energy - depleted ) cells . Immunoblot analysis on ribosomal proteins of both 40S Marini , Nüske , Leng , Alberti , Pigino . 5 and 60S subunits ( RPS4a and RPL32 , respectively ) showed no significant change in the quantity of ribosomes between untreated and energy depleted yeast cells ( Figure 2E ) . In our TEM tomograms , ribosomes appeared as extremely electron dense and were clearly distinguishable as dark dots in the cytoplasm , due to the presence of negatively charged rRNAs that are efficiently stained by contrast reagents used for sample preparation ( Figure 2 , A1 and B1 ; Supplemental Figure S2 , A and B ) . To quantify the ribosome density , we took advantage of their sharp contrast and we developed a FIJI macro to automatically detect and count them in tomographic slices ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) . The images were processed by filtering , binarization , segmentation and particle detection ( Figure 2 , A and B ) . The accuracy of the automated quantification workflow was tested by comparison to ground truth data generated by manual counting of the ribosomes in single tomographic slices ( Supplemental Figure S2 ) . Ribosomes were manually counted in five cytoplasmic squares in every tomogram , avoiding areas that contained mainly large organelles such as vacuole , nucleus or mitochondria . Both quantifications showed that ribosome density increased almost twofold in energy - depleted cells ( Figure 2 , C and D ; Supplemental Figure S2 , C ) . Membrane - less compartments in energy - depleted cells have two distinct morphologies . Recent studies have proposed macromolecular crowding as one of the possible physical conditions to promote condensation of fluorescently labeled enzymes in the cytoplasm of energy depleted yeast cells ( Petrovska et al . , 2014 ; Joyner et al . 2016 ; Munder et al . , 2016 ) . We observed that , along with the dramatic increase in ribosome density , energy - depleted cells in our study showed also cytoplasmic areas from where ribosomes and larger macromolecular complexes were clearly excluded . These areas were never observed in control cells and showed a neat separation from the rest of the cytoplasm without being delimited by membranes . In particular , two main morphologies could be distinguished : some areas appeared as amorphous aggregate - like bodies ( Figure 1C ; Supplemental Figure S4 , C – orange stars ) , other areas appeared as ordered self - assembly structures mostly composed of filaments organized in bundles ( Figure 1 , B and E ; Figure 3C , F - H – green arrows ; Figure 4 – white arrows ; Videos 2 and 3 – white arrows ) . Both type of compartments did not show any obvious specific distribution in the cytoplasm , nor specific interaction with organelles or cellular Marini , Nüske , Leng , Alberti , Pigino . 6 components . The EM data suggest that these membrane - free areas of ribosome exclusion could represent specialized compartments for specific components of the cytoplasm , such as proteins linked to RNA and / or other enzymes , a possible mechanism of stress - induced segregation of such molecular components . eIF2B organize rapidly into highly ordered compartments upon energy depletion Our TEM observations are in agreement with fluorescence microscopy studies reporting that a large number of enzymes , including eIF2B , are able to form assemblies upon nutrient / energy deprivation ( Campbell et al . , 2005 ; Narayanaswamy et al . , 2009 ; Noree et al . , 2010 ; Liu , 2010 ) . However , so far only Gln1 , CtpS and TORC1 enzymes have been shown to self - assemble into highly ordered polymers in such stressful condition by TEM ( Petrovska et al . , 2014 ; Barry et al . , 2014 ; Prouteau et al . , 2017 ) . It is not known whether other enzymes assemble into polymers and whether this is a common occurrence in the cytoplasm of energy - depleted cells . The eIF2B translation initiation factor is a key guanine nucleotide exchange factor highly conserved throughout eukaryotes that plays a fundamental role in the initiation of protein expression ( Kurat et al . , 2006 ; Hinnebusch and Lorsch , 2012 ; Jennings and Pavitt 2014 ; Gordiyenko et al . , 2014 and 2019 ) . It is known to form elongated and reversible fluorescent assemblies in yeast and mammalian cells under different stress conditions ( Campbell et al . , 2005 ; Noree et al . , 2010 ; Nüske et al . , 2018 ; Hodgson et al . , 2019 ) . Therefore , we tested whether eIF2B could be a constituent of one of the highly ordered membrane - less compartments we described above . To test this hypothesis , we performed CLEM on energy - depleted yeast cells overexpressing a sfGFP - tagged version of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B ( eIF2B ) enzyme . Firstly , we followed the sfGFP - eIF2B signal in live - cell fluorescence microscopy ( Supplemental Figure S3 – Video 4 ) . In agreement with a previous study ( Noree et al . , 2010 ) , eIF2B enzymes showed a diffuse cytoplasmic signal in log - phase growing cells ( Supplemental Figure S3 A and E ) . About 15 minutes after energy depletion , most of eIF2B molecules were concentrated into foci and elongated structures , and cell growth and division were heavily slowed down , if not arrested ( Supplemental Figure S3 , B and C ) . This condition lasted until replenishment of ATP , when the fluorescence signal promptly diffused again , and cells quickly re - entered the cell cycle ( Supplemental Figure S3 , D and E ) . The Marini , Nüske , Leng , Alberti , Pigino . 7 reversibility of the condensation process has also been described for self - assemblies made by CtpS ( Barry et al . , 2014 ) , Gln1 ( Petrovska et al . 2014 ) and TORC1 ( Prouteau et al . , 2017 ) , with clear regulatory functions for all the three enzymes . After imaging the fluorescent signal , we prepared yeast cells overexpressing sfGFP - eIF2B , both untreated and energy - depleted cells , for electron microscopy imaging . Then we correlated the fluorescence signals of the condensed eIF2B with the TEM images and located cell sections containing the labeled structures of our interest ( Figure 3 ; Supplemental Figure S4 ) . On those sections , we acquired dual - axis electron tomograms ( Mastronarde 1997 ) . The tomograms of energy - depleted cells showed that eIF2B polymerizes into a specific type of membrane - less cytoplasmic compartment that is composed of long zigzagged filaments packed in big bundles ( Figure 3C , F - H ) . The morphology of eIF2B filaments and bundles was distinct from the morphology of other non - membrane bound compartments of stressed cells ( Figure 3 , F and H – green and white arrows , respectively ) . A single energy - depleted cell could contain several eIF2B bundles , with overexpressing cells showing larger bundles ( Supplemental Figure S4 ) . eIF2B filaments were never observed in untreated cells from the same strain and cell culture ( Video 1 ) . In all analyzed tomograms of stressed cells , macromolecular complexes in the size range of ribosomes were excluded from the space occupied by the eIF2B bundles . Additionally , eIF2B filaments and bundles were never observed to be associated with autophagosomes , which often engulfed cytoplasmic components in energy - depleted cells ( Figure 1 , B and C ; Figure 4 , B - D ; Supplemental Figure S1 – white stars ; Video 3 ) . These data indicate that compartmentalization of eIF2B in the bundles could be a mechanism to escape autophagy and protect the enzyme from vacuolar degradation . sfGFP - tag does not interfere with eIF2B polymerization It has been reported that fluorescent proteins have a natural dimerizing affinity and tend to form aggregates or even higher - order structures ( Zacharias et al . , 2002 ; Snapp et al . , 2003 ) . This might pose a problem for applications in which fluorescent proteins are used to visualize the cellular localization , dynamics , and oligomeric state of a protein . Here , we used three distinct Marini , Nüske , Leng , Alberti , Pigino . 8 approaches to test whether eIF2B self - assembly happens intrinsically or might be caused or enhanced by the GFP tag : i ) we used the non - dimerizing version of GFP ( sfGFP , Costantini et al . , 2012 ) ; ii ) we imaged eIF2B by immunofluorescence using the short HA polypeptide chain as tag ; iii ) we acquired electron tomograms of the native untagged eIF2B in energy - depleted wild - type yeast . For the immunofluorescence experiments , we labeled with HA - tag two distinct subunits of the eIF2B complex , the regulatory subunit Gcn3 ( α ) and the catalytic subunit Gcd1 ( γ ) , and we stained the samples with antibodies against the HA tag ( Supplemental Figure S5 ) . The analysis confirmed that eIF2B formed assemblies upon energy depletion also when a different tag than sfGFP was used . TEM analysis of energy - depleted wild - type cells using untagged eIF2B , either endogenously expressed or overexpressed , revealed bundles of filaments showing the same morphology observed in CLEM experiments ( Figure 4 ) . As observed for sfGFP - tagged cells , bundles of untagged eIF2B were larger in overexpressing strains ( Figure 4A ) than in wild type cells ( Figure 4 , B - F ) . These results demonstrate that the formation of eIF2B filaments and bundles is an intrinsic property of the enzyme and that the sfGFP tag is not involved in this process . Additionally , we observed that the overexpression of eIF2B does not affect the mechanism of filament formation but leads only to bulkier bundles . eIF2B filaments comprise repeats of decameric units To investigate the 3D organization of the filaments in the bundle , we measured the filaments length and the distance between filaments from the raw tomograms ( Figure 5 – Video 5 ) . The filaments length varied from ~ 45 nm to ~ 850 nm . The shorter filaments comprise three or four copies of eIF2B decamers and were usually observed at the periphery of the bundle . Filaments were mostly aligned in regular rows in the bundle , with a between - row spacing of ~ 13 nm and within - row spacing of ~ 26 nm ( Figure 5C ; Figure 6A ) . Diameter , periodicity and spacing of eIF2B filaments in the bundle differed from the ones of previously characterized enzymatic polymers , including those made of other metabolic enzymes such as CtpS , Gln1 and TORC1 ( Barry et al . , 2014 ; Petrovska et al . , 2014 ; Prouteau et al . , 2017 ) . In stressed cells , we also observed filaments with a similar morphology and subunit repeat ( ~ 6 nm ) to the ones described Marini , Nüske , Leng , Alberti , Pigino . 9 for Gln1 ( Petrovska et al . , 2014 ) , with smaller diameter , shorter between - filament spacing , and smoother longitudinal striations than eIF2B filaments ( Figure 3 , F and H – white arrows ) . Because of their apparent repeating structure , eIF2B filaments could represent polymers of a single protein complex . We used a subtomogram averaging approach to obtain a 3D model of the repeating unit . The 3D model showed a zigzag pattern with a 14 . 5 nm repeat ( Figure 6C ) in agreement with the shape of the pattern visible in all the raw tomograms . A single filament measured ~ 16 nm for the long diameter and 13 . 5 nm for the short diameter ( Figure 6C ) . Contact points between central and neighboring filaments were visible in raw tomograms and in the 3D model ( Figure 6 , A and B – white arrows ) as they protruded from both sides of the zigzag shape . The regularity of the inter - filament packing , where a central filament is surrounded by six or seven equidistant neighboring ones ( Figure 5 ; Figure 6A ) , suggested that the observed lateral connections could contribute to keeping distance between molecules and a regular pattern of filaments in the bundle . Although the sample preparation protocol used for ET in this study does not allow for the generation of high resolution 3D models by subtomogram averaging , we extracted the volume of the eIF2B decamer from the cryoEM map of eIF2B / eIF2αP complex ( Adomavicius et al . , 2019 ; Gordiyenko et al . , 2019 ) , and we fitted a gaussian filtered version into our 3D model of the filament . The fitting showed that periodicity and curvatures of three decameric eIF2B units were well accommodated in our 3D model ( Figure 7 ) . The eIF2B decamers needed to be rotated of ~ 45˚ from their vertical axis to fit in the zigzag pattern of the filament , thus the only point of contact between units appears to be through Gcd6 ε - subunits . Since it is known from previous work that eIF2 and eIF2B colocalizes to eIF2 - eIF2B bodies in fluorescent assays of S . cerevisiae , C . albicans , and human astrocytic cells ( Pavitt et al . , 1998 ; Campbell et al . , 2005 ; Egbe et al . , 2015 ; Taylor et al . , 2010 ; Noree et al . , 2010 ; Hodgson et al . , 2019 ) , we fitted the full eIF2 ( αP ) / eIF2B complex ( Adomavicius et al . , 2019 ; Gordiyenko et al . , 2019 ) into the eIF2B filament model in order to understand whether eIF2 can also be present in the polymer . In this case the β and γ subunits of eIF2 protruded outside the filament . However , subunit eIF2α was mostly included in the filament model and the position of the eIF2 protrusions corresponded to the positions of the lateral connections we observe as contact points between the filaments . The eIF2 arm appeared to be very flexible and only transiently in Marini , Nüske , Leng , Alberti , Pigino . 10 contact with eIF2B , explaining why in our 3D model of the filament we observe frequent lateral connections but never with a regular repetition . Discussion In this paper , we demonstrate that entrance of yeast cells into a stress survival state is associated with a broad reorganization of molecules and the formation of structures in the cytoplasm . We reveal that the reorganization involves a massive rearrangement of membranes and lipids as well as the formation of compartments that are not surrounded by membranes . Lipid droplets change their morphology upon energy depletion The observed changes in lipid droplet ( LDs ) morphology might be indicative of the dramatic effects that the scarcity of nutrients / energy has on the regulation of lipid metabolism ( Rußmayer et al . , 2015 ) . In yeast cells , LDs are particularly dynamic throughout the growth phase and depending on the nutritional status of the cell ( Kurat et al . , 2006 ; Bozaquel - Morais et al . , 2010 ) . Cells that progressively reach the stationary phase and experience gradual nutrient depletion , are known to accumulate and enlarge LDs , due to their shift from a lipolytic to a lipogenic metabolism , allowing cells to produce basal levels of energy from fatty acids for cellular maintenance ( Madeira et al . , 2015 ) . Upon replenishment of glucose , large amounts of sterols and fatty acids are mobilized and , as a result , LDs are decreased in number and size ( Kurat et al . , 2006 ) . In our experiments , yeast cells were grown until early - mid log - phase and then exposed to an acute energy starvation , without previous accumulation of LDs . Since starvation is known to switch yeast cell metabolism towards β - oxidation of fatty acids , which yields more energy per gram than carbohydrates like glucose ( Gray et al . 2004 ; Kurat et al . , 2006 ) , LDs present in the cell are strongly mobilized and appeared smaller and fragmented , as a possible consequence of an activation of lipid metabolism . In addition , LDs fragmentation could contribute to the increase in total surface area accessible to lipases , enhancing lipolytic activity and contributing Marini , Nüske , Leng , Alberti , Pigino . 11 to the minimal production of energy during stress conditions , as it has been proposed in animal cells ( Ariotti et al . , 2012 ; Hashimoto et al . , 2012 ; Thiam and Beller , 2017 ) . Plasma membrane invaginations accumulate as a consequence of cell shrinkage The pronounced plasma membrane invaginations present in energy - depleted cells were morphologically similar to those observed in yeast cells under severe hyperosmotic stress . This stress condition is usually associated with dehydration and rapid shrinkage of the cell volume ( Morris et al . , 1986 ; Blomberg and Adler , 1992 ; Gervais and Marechal , 1994 ; Martinez de Maranon et al . , 1996 ; Slaninova et al , 2000 ; Simonin et al . , 2007 ; Dupont et al . , 2010 ) . Concomitantly , due to the poor compressibility of biological membranes ( Thiery et al . , 1967 ) , cell shrinkage is associated with wrinkling of the tonoplast ( Adya et al . , 2006 ) . Therefore , the formation of plasma membrane invaginations that we observed in energy - depleted cells can well be the consequence of the reduction in cell volume , attributed to a sudden water loss that follows the acute energy depletion in S . cerevisiae ( Munder et al . , 2016 ) . Moreover , upon energy replenishment , the cell surface needs to rapidly increase , to allow cells to return to their normal volume . Such a rapid expansion of the plasma membrane requires ‘membrane reservoirs ' that provide surface area and buffer membrane tension . We speculate that the accentuated depth of plasma membrane invaginations in starved cells allows the rapid shrinkage of the membrane into reservoirs , which then provide additional surface for prompt re - expansion of the plasma membrane upon energy replenishment . Ribosome density is a measure of increased macromolecular crowding Munder et al . ( 2016 ) measured a dramatic decrease in particle mobility in the cytoplasm of energy depleted cells , which was proposed to result from increased molecular crowding and condensation of the cytoplasm . However , the measured ~ 7 % reduction in the cell volume would hardly be sufficient to induce this pronounced effect on particle mobility . Therefore , we directly quantified ribosomes in 3D electron tomograms to verify and measure changes in molecular crowding between control and energy depleted yeast cells . While the total ribosome number Marini , Nüske , Leng , Alberti , Pigino . 12 remained unchanged between the two conditions , we observed an almost two - fold increase in ribosome density in energy depleted cells . Based on these data , we estimate a theoretical cell volume reduction of about 42 % , which is far more pronounced than that measured by Munder et al . ( 2016 ) . This discrepancy could be explained by the concomitant enlargement of the vacuole , which has previously been reported to occur in response to starvation ( Desfougères et al . , 2016 ; Joyner et al . , 2016 ) and also during the progression of autophagy ( Noda and Ohsumi , 1998 ) . Indeed , our quantification is in line with previously measured cytoplasmic volume reduction of 30 % in yeast cells upon glucose starvation ( Joyner et al . , 2016 ) . Therefore , we propose that a combination of cell volume reduction and vacuole enlargement is most likely responsible for the increase in molecular crowding observed in starved yeast cells . Regardless of the exact sequence of events causing the changes in the physical - chemical properties of the cytoplasm , our analysis provides a direct quantification of the contribution of molecular crowding in yeast cells . Increased macromolecular crowding is associated with assembly and compartment formation Changes in molecular crowding are thought to have profound effects on cytoplasm organization and on cell physiology . In vitro experiments show that the assembly of individual enzymatic species is triggered by the addition of crowding agents ( Petrovska et al . , 2014 ; Woodruff et al . , 2017 ) . Consequently , crowding has been proposed to play an important role in the formation and stabilization of assemblies and membrane - less compartments in cells . The increased crowding of stressed yeast cells that we report here could indeed represent one of the physical parameters that promote the formation of protein - specific assemblies , such as the bundles of eIF2B filaments . The formation of eIF2B filaments requires the diffusion of soluble components and the incorporation of these components into a nucleation center . Filament nucleation and growth could be promoted by the increased crowding conditions in the cytoplasm , because the resulting higher protein concentration favors molecular interactions and chemical reactions ( Rivas et al . , 2001 ; Zhou et al . , 2008 ) . Conversely , excessive crowding could decrease molecular motion , especially of large particles , resulting in diminished protein assembly and Marini , Nüske , Leng , Alberti , Pigino . 13 binding and consequently a reduced rate of chemical reactions ( Trappe et al . , 2001 ; Miermont et al . , 2013 ; Joyner et al . , 2016 ; Munder et al . , 2016 ) . This suggests that filament nucleation and elongation must occur when crowding does not entirely prevent molecular mobility . Since we observed maximal crowding already after 15 minutes of energy depletion ( Supplemental Figure S3 ) , the recruitment of molecules into filaments must happen very rapidly at the beginning of this process . Hence , we propose that an increased macromolecular crowding in the cell favors and stabilizes assemblies and membrane - less compartments , but it does not necessarily cause nor initiate their formation in the cytoplasm . There is increasing evidence that a sudden intracellular acidification , induced by energy starvation , triggers condensation of several enzymes in yeast cells ( Petrovska et al . , 2014 , Munder et al . , 2016 , Rabouille and Alberti , 2017 ) . This pH drop is thought to change surface charges of molecules , producing new repulsive and attractive molecular interactions in the cytoplasm . Therefore , pH change in the cytoplasm may be a key initiator of enzyme - specific assemblies . Even though the chemical nature of the signal that triggers assembly of eIF2B and other enzymes in energy depleted cells needs to be further elucidated , the process must occur under very low energy levels and before the cytoplasm becomes too crowded . Thus , stressed cells transition from a stage in which cellular components are allowed to dynamically reorganize , to a stage where the cytoplasm is condensed and rather static , as reflected in the reduced mobility of organelles and foreign tracer particles ( Munder et al . 2016 ) . Filaments and bundles form mainly via polymerization of eIF2B decamers The rapid organizing of eIF2B in highly ordered bundles of filaments in the cytoplasm of energy depleted cells suggests that eIF2B filament formation is a specific adaptation to conditions in which energy levels are low . Using immunolabeling and tomography on WT cells , we were able to exclude that filament formation is triggered or affected by sfGFP - tagging , therefore confirming that filaments and bundles formation is an intrinsic property of eIF2B . It has been shown that energy depleted wild type yeast cells undergo translational arrest ( Ashe et al . , 2000 ; Nüske et al . , 2018 ) , whereas eIF2B mutated strains with a reduced ability of forming filaments keep on translating proteins longer after energy depletion ( Nüske et al . , 2018 ) . These findings Marini , Nüske , Leng , Alberti , Pigino . 14 seem to indicate that eIF2B filament formation promotes downregulation of translation and suggests that eIF2B activity is inhibited upon energy depletion . This suggests that filament formation could be a mechanism to silence eIF2B enzymatic activity in cells undergoing energy depletion . Comparison of the eIF2B cryo - EM structure from S . cerevisiae ( Adomavicius et al . , 2019 ; Gordiyenko et al . , 2019 ) with the periodicity and the size of the filament repeating unit , indicates that filaments are formed by polymerization of intact eIF2B decamers , rather than simply aggregation ( Figure 7 ) . More in detail , the fitting suggests that the longitudinal axis of eIF2B decamers might be rotated by ~ 45˚ in their assembled form , making them interact only through the catalytic Gcd6 ε - subunits ( Figure 7 ) . Gcd6 ε - subunit , together with Gcd1 γ - subunit , composes the “catalytic core” of eIF2B , which catalyzes the GDP / GTP exchange reaction ( Williams et al . , 2000 ; Gomez and Pavitt , 2000 ) . This proposed eIF2B arrangement in the filament would partially occlude the catalytic sites of both Gcd6 ε - subunit of eIF2B decamers , suggesting a possible mechanism for enzymatic inhibition . Even though in fluorescent microscopy experiments eIF2B foci are known to colocalize with their reaction substrate , the eIF2 complex ( Pavitt et al . , 1998 ; Campbell et al . , 2005 ; Noree et al . , 2010 ) , we could not accommodate full densities of bound eIF2 molecules into our 3D model of the eIF2B filament ( Adomavicius et al . , 2019 ; Gordiyenko et al . , 2019 ) . Most of the filament density is occupied by eIF2B dimers , indicating that they are generated by polymerization of eIF2B complexes alone . Nevertheless , we cannot completely rule out the presence of eIF2 in the structure of the filament , as it might be only transiently bound to eIF2B filaments ( Campbell et al . , 2005 ) . In summary , we have described the structural rearrangements taking place in the cytoplasm of energy depleted yeast cells ( Figure 8 ) . We propose that these changes allow cells to save energy and to protect essential cellular components , like eIF2B , from denaturation and / or vacuolar degradation . The reversible self - assembly of eIF2B , and potentially other enzymes , aimed for storage and inhibition of their energy demanding activities , could help cells to endure unfavorable environmental conditions . It will be interesting to investigate whether this cytoplasmic reorganization can be a general response for other proteins , in other species and to other kind of stresses . Marini , Nüske , Leng , Alberti , Pigino . 15 Materials and methods Yeast strains , media and energy depletion Wild type Saccharomyces cerevisiae W303 cells and the two strains overexpressing untagged and sfGFP - tagged eIF2B on the C - terminus of the Gcn3 α - subunit were grown in an orbital shaker ( 180 rpm ) at 25˚C in YPD medium containing 1 % ( w / v ) yeast extract , 2 % peptone , and 2 % glucose . Detailed information on the generation of the mutant strains are published in a related study ( Nüske et al . , 2018 ) . Stress treatment was carried out on cells grown to mid - log phase and cellular growth was monitored by optical density ( OD ) at 600 nm . To induce energy depletion ( ATP depletion ) , cells at 0 . 5 OD 600nm were washed twice and then incubated in SD ( synthetic dropout ) complete medium containing 20 mM 2 - deoxyglucose ( 2 - DG ; Carl Roth GmbH , Karlsruhe , Germany ) and 10 M antimycin - A ( Sigma - Aldrich , Steinheim , Germany ) for at least 15 minutes . These two chemicals were used to block glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration , respectively . This treatment reduces intracellular ATP levels by more than 95 % ( Serrano , 1977 ) . Yeast samples were then incubated in an orbital shaker at 30˚C for 1 hour . Log phase yeast cells expressing only endogenous untagged eIF2B were treated in both complete and energy depleted medium in the same way as described above . Fluorescence microscopy Yeast cells were imaged in concanavalin A - coated 4 - well Matek dishes . Fluorescence microscopy of live ( time - lapse movies ) and fixed cells were acquired using a Deltavision microscope system with softWoRx 4 . 1 . 2 software ( Applied Precision ) , 100x 1 . 4 NA UPlanSApo oil immersion objective , and CoolSnap HQ2 camera ( Photometrics ) at 1024x1024 ( or 512x512 ) pixels . Exposure time was 0 . 3 seconds and the interval between consecutive frames in the time lapse was 15 minutes . We determined the exact time required for yeast cells to enter the dormant state upon energy depletion by analysis of the fluorescence microscopy time - lapse movies . This information was Marini , Nüske , Leng , Alberti , Pigino . 16 required to select dormant cells for imaging in TEM and compare their ultrastructure with that of growing cells . Immunostaining For immunostaining , cells expressing GCD1 - γ - HA and Gcn3 - α - HA were fixed via treatment with 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde ( EMS , Hatfield , USA ) for at least 30 minutes followed by 45 minutes incubation in spheroplasting buffer ( 100 mM phosphate buffer pH 7 . 5 , 5 mM EDTA , 1 . 2 M Sorbitol ( Sigma - Aldrich , Steinheim , Germany ) , Zymolyase ( Zymo Research , USA ) at 30˚C with mild agitation . Spheroplasts were permeabilized with 1 % triton X - 100 ( Serva , Heidelberg , Germany ) , washed and incubated with mouse anti - HA primary antibody ( 1 : 2000 ; Covance , USA ) and goat anti - mouse - HRP ( 1 : 5000 ; Sigma , Saint Louis , USA ) . High pressure freezing and freeze substitution of yeast cells Yeast cells , harvested by vacuum filtration , as described in Bertin and Nogales ( 2016 ) , were transferred to 100 µm deep membrane carriers and high pressure frozen with a Leica EM PACT2 or Leica EM ICE freezers ( Leica Microsystems , Wentzler , Germany ) . All samples were processed by freeze substitution in a Leica AFS2 temperature - controlling machine ( Leica Microsystems , Wentzler , Germany ) and then embedded in resin using two distinct protocols for untagged and sfGFP - tagged yeast strains . Untagged eIF2B yeast cells : High pressure frozen samples were freeze substituted using 1 % osmium tetroxide , 0 . 1 % uranyl acetate ( wt / vol ) and 5 % H 2 O ( vol / vol ) in glass distilled acetone . Freeze substitution was carried out at - 90˚C for 36 hours before raising the temperature steadily to - 30˚C in 4˚C per hour . The samples were kept at - 30˚C for 5 hours before they were brought to 0˚C in steps of 4˚C per hour . Samples were washed with acetone and infiltrated with increasing concentrations ( 25 , 50 , 75 and 100 % ; 2 hours each ) of EPON resin ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) . 100 % EPON solution was exchanged two times in 12 - hour steps . Resin infiltrated samples were then UV polymerized at 60˚C for 48 hours . Samples were cut into 150 to 200 nm sections with an ultramicrotome ( Ultracut UCT ; Leica ) and Ultra 35˚ diamond knife ( Diatome ) . The sections were mounted on Formvar - coated slot grids ( Science Services ) . Marini , Nüske , Leng , Alberti , Pigino . 17 Yeast cells sfGFP - tagged on the C - terminal of the Gcn3 α - subunit of eIF2B : Vitrified yeast cells were freeze substituted with 0 . 1 % ( wt / vol ) uranyl acetate and 4 % ( vol / vol ) water in acetone at - 90˚C as described in Kukulski et al . ( 2011 ) . The samples were then embedded in Lowicryl HM - 20 ( Polysciences Inc . ) and cut into 70 , 100 and 150 nm thick sections using an ultramicrotome ( Ultracut UCT ; Leica ) with an Ultra 35˚ diamond knife ( Diatome ) . Correlative light and electron microscopy For CLEM imaging , sections of yeast cells expressing sfGFP - tagged Gcn3 ( α ) - subunit of eIF2B , embedded in Lowicryl HM - 20 ( Polysciences Inc . ) ( Kukulski et al . , 2011 ) , were mounted on Formvar - coated finder grids ( Science Services ) and incubated with quenched blue FluoSphere® fiducials ( Molecular Probes , 200 nm diameter , excitation / emission maxima at 365 / 415 nm ) diluted 1 : 500 for 10 minutes in the dark . Grids were mounted on a glass slide with VectaShield ( Vector Laboratories , Inc . , Burlingame , USA ) and imaged with a Zeiss Axioplan2 wide - field fluorescence CCD upright microscope to record the fluorescence signal in sections of the embedded yeast cells . Images were acquired with a 10x objective lens to generate a grid overview and a 100x objective lens ( na . 1 . 4 ) to image the fluorescence in individual cells . Cells were imaged with a green GFP channel ( 488 nm ) for the sfGFP - tagged eIF2B and a UV channel ( nm ) for the blue FluoSphere® fiducials . The correlation ( overlay ) between the images obtained in fluorescence microscopy and EM micrographs or tomographic slices was performed with AMIRA 2D - 5D visualization and analysis software ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) . Electron tomography All sections from resin embedded samples were stained with 1 % ( wt / vol ) uranyl acetate in 70 % ( wt / vol ) methanol for 5 minutes and 0 . 4 % lead citrate for 3 minutes . Colloidal gold particles ( 15 nm in diameter ) were added to both surfaces of the sections to serve as fiducial markers for tilt series alignment . Tomographic series were acquired in dual - axis tilt scheme ( ±60˚ and 1˚ increments ) with SerialEM ( Mastronarde , 2005 ) , using a FEI Tecnai F30 TEM ( 300 kV ) equipped with Gatan US1000 CCD camera . Pixel size ranged between 7 - 12Å / px . Tomograms reconstruction was performed using the IMOD and ETomo packages ( Mastronarde , 1997 ) . Marini , Nüske , Leng , Alberti , Pigino . 18 Subtomogram averaging Subtomogram averaging was done with PEET software from the IMOD package ( Heumann et al . , 2011 ) . Subtomograms of 54x54x54 voxels ( 40x40x40 nm ) were automatically picked along eIF2B filaments every 15 nm . A final average was calculated from a total of ~ 500 particles . A loose mask was used to refine the central filament average . Semi - automatic segmentation of structures of interest in the tomograms was obtained with the software SuRVoS ( Luengo et al . , 2017 ) . The USCF Chimera package was used for 3D visualization , rendering , and animation of the reconstructed volumes ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) . For eIF2B fitting , eIF2 ( αP ) / eIF2B cryo - EM maps from Adomavicius et al . , 2019 ( EMDB 4404 ) and from Gordiyenko et al . , 2019 ( EMDB 4544 ) have been segmented based on eIF2B and eIF2 subunits from their corresponding atomic models ( PDB 6I3M and 6QG1 , respectively , whose modelling was based on the eIF2B crystal structure of S . pombe from Kashiwagi et al . , 2016 ) . Surfaces of eIF2 subunits have been hidden and all eIF2B subunits have been gaussian filtered at 1 . 5 Å . The fitting in the 3D model of the filament has been performed using the “fit” command in UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) , treating all subunits as a part of a single model .

Bundles of ﬁlamentous structures ( green arrows ) corresponding to the ﬂuorescence signal . eIF2B organizes in ordered , membrane - less arrays of ﬁlaments . Energy - depleted cells also contain other non - membrane bound compartments : some have an amorphous appearance ( orange stars ) , whereas others comprise ﬁlamentous structures ( H ) ( white arrow ) . These ﬁlaments , which do not display a ﬂuorescent signal , have a di ﬀ erent morphology to the eIF2B ﬁlaments and their protein content is unknown .

Fig . 6 Figure 6 . 3D organization of parallel ﬁlaments in the eIF2B bundle . Subtomogram averaging of three repeating eIF2B units along a ﬁlament . ( A - B ) Neighboring ﬁlaments ( in blue ) are still visible in the average , which is indicative of their roughly consistent position around a central ﬁlament ( in red ) . The center - to - center distance between the central ﬁlament and the surrounding ones is ~ 26 nm for ﬁlaments in the same row and ~ 13 nm for ﬁlaments in parallel rows . Lateral connections are visible between the central ﬁlament and the surrounding ones ( white arrows ) . ( B - C ) The longitudinal view of the central ﬁlaments has a zigzag shaped structure . The central ﬁlament shows a 14 . 5 nm repeat , a long diameter of 16 nm and a short diameter of 13 . 5 nm .

Scale bars : A - C = 10 nm ; D = 200 nm . Fig . 7 Figure 7 . Proposed organization of eIF2B decamers in the ﬁlament . The repeating units in eIF2B ﬁlaments have a size and overall shape similar to the Gaussian ﬁltered maps of the cryo - EM eIF2B decamer [ Adomavicius et al . , 2019 ; Gordiyenko et al . , 2019 ] . The ﬁtting of three density maps within three periodic eIF2B units in the 3D model of the ﬁlament obtained by subtomogram averaging suggests a possible stacking of eIF2B decamers in the polymerized form . Fig . 8 Figure 8 . Energy depletion induces a massive reorganization of cytoplasmic structures in yeast cells . ATP - depleted cells undergo volume reduction , with consequent formation of plasma membrane invaginations ( 1 ) and a pronounced increase in macromolecular crowding ( 2 ) . Numerous membrane - less compartments of amorphous ( 3 ) or highly ordered morphology , such as eIF2B ﬁlaments and bundles ( 4 ) , appear in the cytoplasm . Energy - depleted cells are also characterized by the fragmentation of lipid droplets , suggesting a switch to β - oxidative metabolism of fatty acids . All these cellular rearrangements result in a “solidiﬁcation” of the cytoplasm that could function as an energy saving state and as a protective mechanism for molecular components from denaturation and / or vacuolar degradation , to keep them readily available when favorable growth conditions are restored . Supplemental Figure S1 Supplemental Figure S1 . A double membrane vesicle ( white arrow ) is visible int the cytoplasm of an energy - depleted yeast cell . It contains tightly packed ribosomes in the lumen ( white star ) and it might be identiﬁed as an autophagosomal vesicle in the process of bringing its content to the vacuole for degradation . The green arrow points to a ﬁlament in the cytoplasm of the energy - depleted yeast cell . Scale bar = 200 nm . Supplemental Figure S2 Supplemental Figure S2 . Manual method for ribosome counting . A 300 × 300 nm grid is superimposed on the central slice of a tomogram . Ribosomes in 5 cytoplasmic squares are counted , avoiding those comprising mainly large organelles , vacuole or nucleus . Ribosomes in the upper and left edge of each chosen square are included in the count . ( A ) Yeast control cells have usually 50 - 70 ribosomes per 300 nm 2 area . ( B ) Energy depleted yeast cells have usually 100 or more ribosomes per 300 nm 2 area . White arrow highlights a ﬁlament in the stressed cell . ( C ) The result of the manual ribosome counting is shown in the plot . Five tomograms are analyzed for each condition . The almost two - fold increase ( 42 % ) in ribosome density in the stressed yeast cells is conﬁrmed . Supplemental Figure S3 Supplemental Figure S3 . eIF2B enzymes change their cytoplasmic distribution between log - phase growing and energy - depleted yeast cells . ( A ) According to the ﬂuorescent signal , the sfGFP - labeled eIF2B shows a di ﬀ use distribution throughout the cytoplasm in log - phase growing and dividing cells . ( B ) Within 15 minutes from energy depletion , the ﬂuorescence signal of sfGFP - tagged eIF2B is condensed into foci - like and elongated structures . ( C ) After 30 minutes of energy depletion , the number of foci is reduced in favor of larger condensates . ( D , E ) The ﬂuorescent signal rapidly di ﬀ uses upon energy replenishment , and cells re - enter the cell cycle . Scale bar = 10 μ m . Supplemental Figure S4 Supplemental Figure S4 .

Immunoﬂuorescence labeling of two HA - tagged eIF2B subunits show ﬁlament bundles in energy - depleted yeast cells . ( A ) Immunolabeling of the HA - tagged Gcn3 ( α ) and ( B ) Gcd1 ( γ ) subunits of eIF2B show that the formation of ﬁlament bundles in energy - depleted cells occurs in the absence of the sfGFP tag . This demonstrates that separation of eIF2B in non - membrane bound compartments is not induced or enhanced by the sfGFP tag . Scale bars = 10 µm .
