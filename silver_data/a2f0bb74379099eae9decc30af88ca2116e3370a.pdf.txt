The primary goal of this study is to develop experimental methods to quanti - tatively determine forces generated from cell contraction and cell - to - cell adhesion . A novel method has been developed to measure the cell contraction forces exerted within a cell - embedded collagen matrix . The technique provides a 3D cell - matrix model which allows estimation of the cell contraction forces over a certain period of time . It was found that embedded ﬁbroblast cells are able to cause a shrinkage of their surrounding matrix due to cell contractility . Tailored equipment which has ultimate force and displacement resolutions of 10 nN and 100 nm respectively has been constructed to accurately determinate the elasticity of cell - embedded colla - gen matrix . In combination with a mathematical model , the cell contraction force can be calculated based on the geometric parameters of the collagen matrix before and after the shrinkage . Reagents of agonist ( histamine ) or antagonist ( ML - 7 ) have been used to stimulate or block the ﬁbroblast contraction force . They both show the e ↵ ect of altering the sti ↵ ness of an extracellular matrix which is critical in the determination of cell contraction forces . More importantly , the analysis of the mea - sured data based on a non - linear mechanical model have also conﬁrmed that the elasticity of the extracellular matrix will inﬂuence the ﬁbroblast contraction force . Cell - to - cell adhesion is an intricate interplay of mechanical , chemical and electrical signals between cells . A novel method based on Atomic Force Microscopy Single Cell Force Spectroscopy ( AFM - SCFS ) has been applied to examine cell - to - cell adhesion of human kidney proximal tubule HK2 cells . Ketamine was used to evoke early changes in expression of proteins ( E - cadherin , N - cadherin and   - catenin ) central to adherens junctions that lead to the loss of cell - to - cell adhesion force . The results provide strong evidence that the illicit substance Ketamine has major impacts on renal function and the loss of intracellular adherent energy . Overall , both cell contraction and cell - to - cell adhesion experiments demonstrated that the changes of biological states evoke protein interactions which would ultimately lead to the biomechanical alterations . Therefore , characterising the changes of mechano - biological properties can provide new insight into the investigation of physiological and pathological issues . xviii Abbreviations ADP Adenosine Diphosphate AFM Atomic Force Microscopy AFM - SCFS Atomic Force Microscopy Single Cell Force Spectroscopy ANOVA Analysis Of Variance ATCC American Type Culture Collection ATP Adenosine Triphosphate BFP Biomembrane Force Probe BMI Body Mass Index CCD Charge Coupled Device CGCA Collagen Gel Contraction Assay DAG Diaglycerol DAQ Data Acquisition DMEM Dulbeccos’ Modiﬁed Eagle’s Medium EDL Electrical Double Layer E - Modulus Elastic Modulus FA Focal Adhesion FCS Fetal Calf Serum F - D Force - Displacement FPCL Fibroblast - Populated Collagen Lattice h hour ( s ) HAoAF Human Aortic Adventitial Fibroblasts HRFS High Resolution Force Spectroscopy xix ICCJ Interactive Control Centre Joystick IP3 Inositol Triphosphates kg kilogram MA Micropipette Aspiration min minute ( s ) ml millilitre MLC Myosin Light Chain MLCK Myosin Light Chain Kinase MTC Magnetic Twisting Cytometry mm millimetre mM micromolar MN Micro - Needle mN micro Newton mPAD micro - fabricated Post Array Detector MT Magnetic Tweezers NI Nano - Indentation nm nano metre nN Nano Newton OT Optical Tweezers PBS phosphate - Bu ↵ ered Saline P - value value of statistical signiﬁcance R 2 - value coe   cient of determination SCC Source Code Control SD Substrate Deformation s . e . m standard error of the mean TFM Traction Force Microscopy µ N Micro Newton xx Chapter 1 Introduction to cell mechanics 1 . 1 Introduction Over the past few decades , the way of thinking about life science questions has been undergoing a radical and revolutionary transformation . The subject of biology has been transformed from a qualitative and observational discipline into a more quantitative one in terms of all aspects of works from DNA level to organ level . Many sub - disciplines have been emerging and demanding an interdisciplinary integration among biology , statistics , mathematics , physics , engineering and computer science . As a result , biophysics and biomechanics are becoming increasingly important in contribution to the conventional biology and physics . With the advancement of imaging technology , there is a desperate need for probing the mechanical properties of biological samples from tissues to molecules . In particular , many established cellular processes and diseases can be shifted in paradigm by understanding the role of mechanical forces . For example , the forces triggered by the cellular processes can initiate cell adhesion , migration , proliferation and contraction [ 118 ] . Similarly , mechanical loading , including ﬂuid shear and cell 1 stretching , can also serve as an extracellular signal which regulates cells’ phenotype [ 35 ] . Moreover , interfering with cell sensing process has been proven to relate to several pathological phenomena , such as cancer , atherosclerosis and osteoporosis [ 35 , 76 , 133 ] . Therefore , all these cell behaviours associated with mechanical forces have led to the study of cell mechanics [ 145 ] . The term cell mechanics here speciﬁcally refers to the study that uses tailored engineering tools to investigate mechanical behaviours of cells . The primary goal of this chapter is to introduce some diseases that are asso - ciated with cell mechanics and adhesion . Due to the size and complex characteristics of biological cells , there are several challenges in measuring their mechanics and ad - hesion which will be introduced in the following sections . In Chapter 2 , a number of state - of - the - art experimental techniques have been surveyed and reported in detail . Chapter 3 describes the nano - bio - mechanical tester developed for measuring cell mechanics in terms of hardware and software conﬁgurations . Chapter 4 describes the nano - bio - mechanical tester in combination with a mathematical model that has been used to quantify the contraction force of single cells in vitro using ﬁbroblasts embedded in a collagen gel matrix . Further results of extra - cellular matrix regulat - ing the ﬁbroblast contraction force are presented in Chapter 5 . Chapter 6 describes a novel method to measure cell - to - cell adhesion force by using Atomic Force Mi - croscopy ( AFM ) force spectroscopy . Finally , some more important conclusions that can be drawn from this research and a number of recommendations of how this research topic can be further developed are given in Chapter 7 . 1 . 2 Cell mechanics and human diseases Most of our understanding of health and disease is based on the mechanism of bi - ology and biochemistry . However , a signiﬁcant level of attention has been shifted 2 towards thinking about the mechanics of cells in relation to some common diseases such as cancer , hypertension , and diabetes . For instance , cancer cells often exhibit a di ↵ erent elasticity compared to healthy cells and blood vessel cells change con - tractility subject to the high blood pressure [ 38 ] . Not only does this imply that the physiological system has a mechanical mechanism to maintain the fundamental structure , but also suggest that the human cellular system will respond to biome - chanical stimulation . Understanding human pathological phenomena would often require the understanding of cell mechanics . The following list shows some typical examples that elaborate how biomechanics at the cellular level directly impacts the human physiological system and further leads to pathological disease . • In the process of hearing , external environment generates physical loadings ( sound waves ) that are potentially perceived by the human ears . Sensing ele - ments ( i . e . inner ear bones , cilium and cochlea ) will conduct a large number of biochemical and biomechanical events , for instance , wave causes the vibration of inner ear bones and calcium ions will ﬂow into the cilia due to the opening mechanism of tip links . The cilium will then convert these mechanical load - ings into biochemical signals so that human brain can interpret those signals through nerve impulses . In the process , the sound waves as an external load - ing stimulates the actin ﬁlaments between two adjacent cilia . It is essential that the cilia should maintain the right mechanical characteristic in order to handle the deﬂection caused by the sound wave [ 114 ] . • Infection is another common example of how foreign genetic information is delivered into the human immune system . The very ﬁrst step for the virus infection is to destroy the cell’s intrinsic protection , i . e . membrane , by me - chanically disrupting the normal cell activities . However , cell membranes have their protection mechanism , called endocytosis . During one type of endocyto - sis of foreign genetic cargo ( i . e . receptor - mediated ) , the receptor of designated 3 cells ﬂows to bind the ligands of a virus . The virus would eventually be en - veloped into the cell . During the whole process , the behaviours of cell adhesion , folding and pinching , are mechanically important for both cargo delivery and cell protection [ 85 ] . • Breathing and heart beating are also interesting examples to show how me - chanical contractile forces play a major role in physiology processes . The air - way smooth muscle cells and epithelial cells conduct cyclic stretches in order to maintain breathing pressure . Moreover , stretching forces generate feedback signals for basement membrane to monitor the breathing conditions . If the smooth muscle cells are hypersensitised by airborne pathogens , the cells will keep in hypercontractility condition , which will ultimately cause asthmatic at - tack [ 104 ] . The mechanical dysfunction of cardiac myocytes directly relates to the arrhythmogenesis with congestive heart failure . The calcium ﬂuxes reg - ulate the switches of myoﬁlaments which lead to the activation of myocytes contraction [ 9 ] . • Cancer cells exhibit metastasis largely owing to the decrease of cell - to - cell adhesion forces . The cancer cells , in the process of remaining metastatic , will detach from the tumour and relocate to a new site to grow . Cell migration , detachment and reattachment are all involved with mechanical events . The tumour , as a whole , will also regulate itself with surrounding environment , such as hardening connective tissues and redirecting blood vessels , to create a more comfortable and nutritional growing environment [ 20 ] . • Skeletal structure is one of the most noticeable systems in the human body that constantly endures mechanical loadings . Evidence show that bone cells are likely to remain healthy if bones are continually under mechanical stimulation [ 131 ] . Osteoporosis contributing to fragility and higher risk of fracture is more likely to take place in the individuals who have less exercise . It means 4 that most of the osteoblasts have their sensing elements to detect physical movements . With more usage of the cells , it is likely that the target cells will have faster metastasis . Overall , the cell is a dynamic system which interacts and adapts towards external microenvironment continuously to maintain a healthy state . With all these active evidence in our living system , the importance of investigating mechanical behaviours of biological cells cannot be ignored . It is clear that the systems not only have a me - chanical function which support the physiological environment , such as blood vessels and heart pump blood and skeleton supports body , but also actively respond to the mechanical loading , for example , bones reinforce and degrade due to mechanical forces . 1 . 3 Contraction and adhesion Intracellular contraction force , cell - to - cell adhesion and cell - to - substrate adhesion force are vital for many biological processes ; for instance , wound healing , cell regen - eration , inﬂammation , and cancer . Among these processes , the most fundamental behaviour which includes both cell contraction forces and adhesive forces is cell migration ( locomotion ) . Cell locomotion consists of four continuous steps : i ) pro - trusion , ii ) adhesion , iii ) translocation , and iv ) release as shown in Figure 1 . 1 . Cells may undergo more than one step at any point of time . The ﬁrst phase is called protrusion . In this step , the polymerisation of actin ﬁlaments at the leading edge of the cell controls the formation of lamellipodium and ﬁlopodium . The veil - like lamellipodium and ﬁnger - like ﬁlopodium both contain rich cross - linked actin bundles . It is well - acknowledged that the actin polymerisa - tion propels the change of membrane conﬁguration and mediates the protrusion of 5 Figure 1 . 1 : Schematic diagram of cell locomotion . The moving direction in this case is towards right . The steps include protrusion , adhesion , translocation and release . 6 lamellipodium [ 130 ] . The second step is adhesion when the cell membrane moves forwards and a new conﬁguration of cytoskeleton is quickly assembled . There will be a new assembly point from the membrane ﬁrmly attached to the substrate . The cell and substrate develop new focal adhesion ( FA ) points and generates adhesion forces . The adhesion force causes the cell to ﬁrmly anchor to the substrate and leads to the third step , i . e . translocation . During this procedure , the cell moves towards the direction where new FA points are generated . Intracellular contraction force is then created . The mechanism of how contraction forces are generated will be introduced later in Section 1 . 3 . 1 . Actin - myosin interaction dominates the process . The very last step of this cyclic activity is the release of the rear end FA . The loss of adhesion force combined with contraction force generated in phase three collectively pushes the cell to move forward . 1 . 3 . 1 Cellular contraction force Mechanism of cell contraction force The mechanism of cell contraction was ﬁrstly reported in 1954 by two separate research groups [ 70 , 71 ] . They have proposed the sliding ﬁlament theory which explains the model of multiple muscle proteins sliding towards each other to generate contraction force . Huxley has modiﬁed the model by stating that the ﬁlament sliding occurs by cyclic attachment and detachment of myosin on actin ﬁlaments . Contraction forces are generated when the myosin pulls the actin ﬁlament towards the centre of cells [ 72 ] . The theory was recently validated and regarded as the ‘cross - bridge’ model based on the actomyosin interactions [ 44 , 142 ] . Brieﬂy , the model considers actin ﬁlaments and myosin , residing in most of the cellular systems , to be responsible for the cell contraction . Myosin acts as a molecular motor to convert chemical energy ATP to mechanical energy for contrac - 7 ( a ) ( b ) Figure 1 . 2 : ( a ) Schematic diagram of the myosin conﬁguration cross - bridge model . In the cyclic model , the actin molecule slides from right to left . ( b ) The organisation of a sarcomere that constitutes the basic contractile unit . 8 tion whilst the actin ﬁlament as part of the cytoskeleton structure is responsible for driving the entire cell entity in motion . Figure 1 . 2a shows a schematic of actin - myosin’s cyclic process illustrated by the cross - bridge model . The cycle starts at the top where actin and myosin are tightly bonded in the absence of ATP / ADP ( adenosine triphosphate / adenosine diphosphate ) . The phase is also known as rigor state ( phase 1 ) . After ATP moves in and bonds with myosin , the hydrolysis of ATP makes the myosin start to release from the actin ﬁlament ( phase 2 ) . The release of chemical energy from ATP induces myosin to change conformation and become a cocked conﬁguration ( phase 3 ) . In this state , the neck region of myosin moves towards the ( - ) area . The displacement is around 5 nm . The hydrolysis product ( ADP and P i ) remain attached to the myosin’s head . In between phase 3 and phase 4 , the release of phosphate is activated by the actin and triggers a ‘power stroke’ . In the process of the ‘power stroke’ ( phase 4 ) , the myosin drags the actin ﬁlament to move , in this case , left . The mechanical forces and physical displacement of cell entity are generated in phase 4 . In phase 5 and 6 , at the release of spent molecule ADP , the system returns to the original state and completes the cycle . The cross - bridge model explains the interaction between one actin and one myosin molecule . Inside cell entity , several hundreds of myosin molecules are stag - gered and interlocked at their long ↵ - helical tails as Figure 1 . 2b shows . F - actin was derived from G - actin polymerisation and formed a polar conﬁguration . The ‘ + ’ and ‘ - ’ represent the barbed and pointed ends of the actin polymer . The entire length of one F - actin ﬁlament is around 36 nm and there are limited binding sites for myosin’s head to attach to . The overall movement of a myosin head is limited to 5 nm . Hence , in each full twist of z - disc , it is impossible for every myosin molecule to reach far enough to a binding site . In fact , only very few myosin heads are able to grab a binding site as Figure 1 . 2b shows . The overall productions of myosin molecule sliding contributes to the cell contraction . 9 Modulation of the cell contraction force by the matrix Human cells rely greatly on their surrounding matrices to maintain the vitality and the function of the human tissue . Cells naturally adhere to extracellular matrices , which constitutes a mechanically stable and elastic micro - environment . Many bio - logical cells , such as ﬁbroblasts , epithelial and endothelial cells , have the ability to reconstruct the mechanical properties of their surrounding microenvironment [ 110 ] . This behaviour has been widely studied in regenerative medicine and tissue engineer - ing . The mechanism helps the human body to recover from damaged tissue by cell proliferation and di ↵ erentiation towards the formation of a new healthy tissue . In the meantime , when cells anchor to the extracellular matrices , physical behaviours will be triggered to probe the mechanical properties of their encompassing territo - ries . For example , focal adhesions link the actin - myosin cross - bridge inside the cell with a number of extracellular matrix proteins outside the membrane and regulate the transmitting signals during contraction [ 8 , 51 ] . It has also been shown that the FA is mechano - sensitive and regulated by the external force in terms of size , shape and composition [ 50 , 170 ] . Hence , FA is the mediator that transmits and converts forces into biochemical signals to regulate cell contractions . The extracellular matrix changes its mechanical property constantly and subtly . Therefore , ECM generates mechanical signals continuously which are probed by FA and translated to the cells . Meanwhile , cells generate contraction force after the signals are perceived which results in the conformation changes of extracellular matrices and a ↵ ects neighbour - ing cells . The overall structure forms the intercellular feedback loop . In addition , mechano - sensing of the extracellular matrix is synergistically controlled by many subcellular signalling molecules such as integrins and cadherins [ 1 ] . 10 1 . 3 . 2 Cellular adhesion Cell adhesion is a fundamental mechanism whereby cells are organised and formed in tissues and organs . Cell adhesion also can be regarded as a complex system whereby cells translate various interactional genetic information in response to bio - chemical signals and ﬁnally form our organs and tissues . Cells change adhesion energy continuously to maintain their stability and activity [ 10 ] . The form of this behaviour is presented as cell mobility and contractility . There are two forms of adhesion interactions that are widely studied : cell - cell adhesion and cell - ECM ad - hesion . Cadherins and integrins have been implicated in the control of cell adhesion and the maintenance of cell structure . Cadherins mainly mediate cell - cell adhesion in terms of compaction and rearrangements whilst integrins regulate cell - ECM adhe - sion on spreading and motility . E - cadherin in epithelium has been mostly studied in the cadherin family . It is a transmembrane Ca 2 + - dependent homophilic adhesion re - ceptor . Cadherin can link two adjacent cells directly by multivalent linker molecules . In the process of cadherin mediated cell - cell adhesion , ↵ - catenin and   - catenin are formed to link actin and to transmit signal , respectively . Hence , signals generated by the adhesion receptors contribute to the regulation of cell - cell adhesion . More - over , adhesion receptors , cytoskeleton and signal pathways conjointly regulate the tissue morphogenesis . Integrin also belongs to the family of transmembrane proteins that tightly bind with the plasma membrane and intracellularly connect to the cell cytoskeleton . The process of cell motility and major enzymatic activities are vital for regulating cell - ECM interactions . Integrins are dimers which are composed of ↵ - and   - subunits [ 73 ] . For example , ↵ 5   1 integrin is a ﬁbronectin receptor which has isoform of ↵ 5 subunit and   1 subunit . Integrins would assemble into the focal adhe - sion with a highly regulated mechanism however the exact role of each component has not yet been well deﬁned . 11 1 . 4 Multi - scale biomechanics Cells organise themselves in biological systems by proliferation , migration , and dif - ferentiation . In each of the processes , di ↵ erent biomechanical behaviours are in - volved . These include cell - cell adhesion and contraction which decide how cells assemble themselves into tissues or escape from them . The deep down molecular level mechanics such as actin - myosin induced protein movement enable to reﬁne larger scale of study such as cell contractility . The cell - level or so - called micro - scale studies also relate to the mesoscale behaviours ; for example , cell contractility can be further studied in terms of its e ↵ ect on cell migration in extracellular matrix . More - over , mesoscale behaviours would result in the macro - scale ( tissue ) phenomena . For example , cell migration and contraction are directly linked with skin wrinkling , age - ing and wound reorganisation [ 165 ] . In all , macroscopic tissue level activities are induced by the single molecule protein mechanics . The multi - scale coordination and regulation form the entire physiology system . Amazingly , our body invents the mechanism and regulates interactions with minimum consumption of energy . Mechanics is the subject that studies the quantitation method of physical materials which are subjected to force and displacement . Biomechanics has been applied to study the mechanical properties of biological systems , such as human organs , tissues and cells . Nano - biomechanics is a special type of biomechanics in terms of the scale of measurement . The macroscopic biomechanics is always based on the assumption that the material is homogeneous in composition and the size of test probe is always negligible . However , this is not normally true as the biological sample is usually a mixture of a large number of di ↵ erent proteins and compos - ites . The latest development of force and displacement measurement technology allows the investigation into small groups of protein , such as the research topics of nano - measurement , nano - ﬂuids and nano - fabrication [ 146 ] . By extracting the pa - 12 ( a ) ( b ) Figure 1 . 3 : ( a ) Young’s modulus of di ↵ erent bio - materials ( adapted from [ 4 ] ) . ( b ) More cells that Young’s modulus speciﬁes according to the review [ 155 ] . 13 rameters of force and displacement , in combination with mathematical models , it is now possible to analyse mechanical properties of the materials or samples . The work o ↵ ers to provide new insight into observing the biological and pathological phenomena . Thanks to the advancement in nano - fabrication and microscopy , peo - ple can further manipulate cells and molecules at force and displacement of less than a piconewton ( pN ) and a nanometre ( nN ) respectively . The results can provide us with unique mechanical parameters , such as Young’s modulus , rigidity , Poisson’s ratio , compressibility , contractility and viscoelasticity . Young’s modulus ( or elastic - ity modulus ) attracts the most interest in studying biomechanics . Young’s modulus of cells can be calculated in vitro by acquiring a Force - Displacement ( F - D ) curve using di ↵ erent nano / micro - mechanical testers . Suitable mechanical models for cells are subsequently applied to mathematically ﬁt the F - D curve . A comprehensive review has introduced many mechanical models including Hertz , JKR , Lifshitz , and Tatara theories [ 101 ] . Figure 1 . 3a shows common elastic modulus of bio - materials . Cells are the least elastic material in the diagram . This enhances the di   culties of measurement and determination . Figure 1 . 3b shows elastic moduli of di ↵ erent cells which have been examined by Atomic Force Microscopy ( the measuring technique will be introduced in Chapter 2 and Chapter 6 ) . 1 . 5 Grand challenges in cell mechanics As we have described in this chapter , biomechanics is related to many physiological and pathological processes . The cell is a complex system where each protein has speciﬁc tasks . Nano - biomechanics studies provide a methodology for working at atomic , molecular , sub - cellular , and cellular - level in order to understand mechani - cal structures and create new materials that have functions similarly to our human body . However , comprehensive analysis of biomechanics for human cells is extremely 14 di   cult . It includes cytoskeleton , membrane and cell entity . Moreover , biological cell is a viscoelastic material which means ﬂuid - like and solid - like behaviours both exhibit in the system . In order to probe the mechanical properties of cells , sophis - ticated mechanical measuring devices are required . Higher resolution , faster speed , less noise , feedback control processes are necessary for this type of study . During the measurement , any changes in temperature and humidity would a ↵ ect the experiment as the size of protein and cell is extremely small . In addition , primary samples from the human body have variations concerning BMI ( body mass index ) , genetic disease , age and gender . It often requires statistical assessment of any mechanical testing re - sults . Furthermore , experiment situation in vitro is relatively well controlled whilst in vivo testing could be a ↵ ected by many potential complications from physiological environments . Basic fundamental mechanics can solve most of the cell mechanics questions , however , there is still many to be done by using advanced mechanical analysis . On top of this , much research in this area requires extensive collabora - tion . This research normally involves the development of nanomechanical testing devices , building mechanical / mathematical models , creating platforms / procedures for testing and validation , biological hypotheses and exploration , animal testing , and clinical trials . 15 Chapter 2 Cellular force sensing techniques 2 . 1 Introduction To date , various nano - / micro - mechanical testers exist in the area of experimental analysis of biological samples . Several comprehensive reviews [ 99 , 100 , 133 , 156 ] have reported the development of state - of - the - art biomechanical tools and their current applications along with many advanced mechanical models . Selecting a suitable mechanical tester requires the estimation of the size of samples and the measuring capacity . Figure 2 . 1 shows the typical force and displacement range in the study of biomechanics . Force is in the range from 1 nano - Newton ( 10   9 N ) to 1 micro - Newton ( 10   6 N ) for cell mechanics study whilst the force to manipulate protein and molecule is required in the range of pico - Newtons ( 10   12 N ) . In this study , the focus is mainly laid on the contraction and adhesion measuring techniques . 16 ( a ) ( b ) Figure 2 . 1 : Force ( a ) and distance ( b ) range of common biological events .

Adapted from [ 99 , 156 ] . 17 2 . 2 Mini - review of contraction force measurement tech - nique Cellular contraction forces are normally measured indirectly by probing the cell - embedded or cell - populated matrices . Measurement of forces generated by cells can be performed on cell populations or single cells . The original technique to study contraction force generated by a cell population was invented by Bell et al [ 6 ] . Fibroblasts were embedded in the collagen gels . Cell contraction force was indicated by the magnitude of gel radius or volume shrinkage . The technique was improved by Delvoye et al to accurately determine contraction force using the technique known as culture force monitor ( CFM ) [ 32 ] . Brieﬂy , in the method , strain gauges are attached to the edge of cell - embedded collagen gels so as to acquire contraction force generated by the cells continuously . To obtain single cell contraction force , Harris et al developed a method by laying the cells onto elastic substratum , called ‘Traction Force Microscopy ( TFM ) ’ [ 57 , 58 ] . The traction forces that each cell exerts will deform the substrate and create visible wrinkling . On the surface , the cell traction force can be determined by the number of wrinkles at micrometre level . Owing to the increasing interests in the mechanics of cell locomotion , strengths and adhesion , several new single cell techniques have been developed to quantify the contraction force , such techniques including optical traps [ 87 ] , micro - needle / micropillar arrays [ 147 ] and micro - machined substrata [ 49 ] . 2 . 2 . 1 Collagen gel - based contraction assay Cell - embedded collagen matrix provides a unique way to study the mechanical inter - actions within the 3D culture . Such interaction was not easy to examine on a normal in vitro cell culture because the culturing areas are ﬁxed on a monolayer . When cells are evenly distributed inside a collagen matrix , the traction forces generated 18 by cells exist in the collagen matrix at all directions . Meanwhile , collagen ﬁbrils will develop isometric tension to retain their original shape and resist deformation . The tension would consequently load on the cells and generate reciprocal interactions . As the collagen ﬁbres are linked , traction forces are propagated throughout the col - lagen matrix resulting in global remodelling and contraction . This mechanism of cell - embedded collagen matrix is similar to the in vivo homeostatic response . Soft connective tissues are under enormous endogenous tension caused by their resident cells where contraction force is generated upon the extracellular matrix . Many re - searchers have used the method to determine the mechanism of how cells regulate the contraction . The recipe and the protocol of collagen gel contraction assay can be found in the literature [ 120 ] . Several models have been developed for di ↵ erent cell - embedded collagen con - traction assays . Figure 2 . 2 illustrates the di ↵ erence of the three major types of collagen matrix contraction models . Figure 2 . 2a shows most commonly used model . When cells are evenly seeded into the collagen matrix , it takes 20 - 60 minutes for gels to polymerise in a 37 ￿ incubator . Collagen gel will then be immediately dis - lodged from the surface of a Petri dish . A gel will be ﬂoating and mainly have radius reduction which can be observed from the top view of the Petri dish . The common expressions of the magnitude of contraction are represented by the percentage of gel reduction before and after the measurement period . Here a list of some research that has used cell - embedded collagen matrix based techniques to measure the cell contrac - tion events [ 3 , 12 , 29 , 42 , 65 – 68 , 74 , 77 , 111 , 121 , 129 , 132 , 144 , 150 , 153 , 169 , 173 ] . Figure 2 . 2b represents anchored cell contraction assay . Compared with the ﬂoating con - traction array , an anchored gel contraction assay will mainly have thickness / height reduction as the bottom side of collagen matrix is adhered tightly with Petri dish . The tension in this type of model will be distributed anisotropically . Figure 2 . 2c is the modiﬁcation of the previous methods . This method was developed by Tomasek 19 Table 2 . 1 : Selected cell - embedded collagen gel - based studies which pertain to the listed disease / disorder categories . Disease / disorder category Selected References Cardiovascular Disease [ 29 , 153 ] Aging [ 121 ] Growth Factor ( TGF -   1 ) [ 12 , 42 , 65 , 150 ] Wound Healing [ 12 , 67 , 68 , 74 , 129 , 153 , 173 ] Eye disease [ 3 , 111 , 132 ] Respiratory system diseases [ 42 , 66 , 169 ] Platelet disorder [ 144 ] Oral health [ 77 ] et al [ 152 ] . Stress will be developed during the period when the gel was anchored to the dish . After dislodging from the dish , stress will be eliminated . Many re - searchers have used this method to study the di ↵ erence between pre - stressed and relaxed cells [ 39 , 89 , 125 ] and to investigate environmental stress e ↵ ects on the cells . Signiﬁcant e ↵ orts have been made to correlate cellular studies performed by collagen gel - based contraction with the pathology of the disease . In an e ↵ ort to elaborate the breadth and depth of disease - related research since Bell et al in - vented the method , a few selected disease categories with their literature refer - ences are listed in Table 2 . 1 . A number of review articles related to collagen gel based contraction assay advances in biochemistry and biophysics have been pub - lished [ 1 , 27 , 35 , 52 , 55 , 91 , 95 , 96 ] . The main cell type to study cell contraction force is ( myo ) ﬁbroblast derived from skin , lung and blood vessels . ( Myo ) ﬁbroblast are deeply embedded in the cellu - 20 ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) Figure 2 . 2 : Models for cell - embedded collagen matrices for testing magnitude of contraction .

The growth factor in situ will enhance their adhesion , signalling , sequestration or activation [ 28 ] . In terms of pathological situation , the interaction between ﬁbroblast and matrix has direct impacts on wound healing , ageing and skin defect . The commonly - used method for detecting cell contraction is measuring the percentage shrinkage of collagen gel area [ 6 ] . A long focal camera is placed on top of the culture plate . The focus is tuned to the point at the centre of the plate . It is recommended that the lid of the culturing plate is removed to acquire a better view . As the culturing plate ( e . g . Petri dish , multi - well plate ) is often transparent , the background colour is often advisable to be black or a darker shade . To assure that camera focus is at the centre of the plate when taking the image , it is advisable to inspect whether the distances between outer rim and inner rim are constantly equal along the periphery as Figure 2 . 3 shows . The collagen radius / diameter is often calculated by referencing culturing area of the Petri dishes . In this case , the culturing area is normally shown as the green circled area in Figure 2 . 3b . It is advocated that the images of the culturing area should be calibrated before the testing . Hence , the actual gel radius ( r gel ) can be calculated by the following equation : r gel = ✓ P gel P dish · S dish ⇡ ◆ 12 ( 2 . 1 ) where P gel and P dish represent the pixels of collagen gel and Petri dish ( cul - ture area ) captured in the images , respectively . S dish represents the area of culturing surface which normally shows in the product information of Petri dishes . The overall numbers of pixels in the images are the representation of measuring area of speciﬁc region . 22 ( a ) ( b ) Figure 2 . 3 : ( a ) Schematic diagram of long focal microscope to measure collagen gel diameter in Petri dishes . ( b ) Example images for measuring the collagen radius . It is necessary to keep the distance between outer and inner rim constant to ensure the focus is at the centre of Petri dish . 23 2 . 2 . 2 Culture Force Monitor ( CFM ) The methods mentioned above for measuring geometric changes of cell - embedded collagen gel give a simple solution to quantify cellular contractility . However , these approaches have an intrinsic drawback , that is when the contraction force is rela - tively small , the representation of radius changes does not signiﬁcantly show ade - quate sensitivity . To overcome this challenge , Delvoye et al [ 32 ] invented an approach to monitor the overall contraction forces generated from embedded cells by attach - ing the strain gauges to collagen edges . The method has successfully improved the sensitivity limited by measuring gel radius alone . The method is known as Culture Force Monitor ( CFM ) [ 32 ] . Figure 2 . 4 shows the schematic diagram that explains the basic principle of how CFM works . In typical CFM systems , cell - embedded collagen gel is normally attached to the plates to restrain the gel’s movement . The strain gauge is connected to one of the plates while the other plate is attached to a x - y stage that adjusts and provides the gel with a minimum initial strain . The entire system is then placed in a 37 ￿ incubator for online monitoring . The alternative type of CFM system is based on the free - ﬂoating collagen matrix . There are two - needled strain gauges directly connected to the collagen matrix . It measures the isometric contraction by each pointing the other through the centre of the collagen matrix . This set - up provides the maximum sensitivity for the force transducer . It is able to detect the contraction force for the gel displacement down to 0 . 5 mm which is a barely noticeable change [ 36 ] . Since the discovery of CFM , various research groups have been devoted to modifying the method and applying it to numerous cell types with related biological events , such as cell morphology [ 37 , 47 ] , tensional homoeostasis [ 15 , 19 , 137 ] , collagen sti ↵ ness e ↵ ect [ 83 , 105 , 172 ] and growth factor / agonist e ↵ ect [ 18 , 86 ] . Besides these applications , signiﬁcant improvement has been made to increase the CFM e   ciency . 24 Figure 2 . 4 : Schematic diagram of a traditional culture force monitor . The cell - embedded collagen matrix is placed in a hydrophobic chamber where two plates are locked and attached to the edge of the gel . One side of the plate is ﬁxed to a x - y stage at the bottom of the culture plate . The other plate is attached to a strain gauge to measure overall contraction force that the cell generates . 25 Wang and co - workers have reported a multi - station CFM [ 18 , 19 , 127 ] which is able to measure multiple biological samples simultaneously . This improvement saves a signiﬁcant amount of time to examine a patch of cells in vitro and facilitates the statistical analysis . CFM can also be used as a tool to pre - stress the cell - embedded collagen gel [ 83 , 105 ] , to mimic the stressed environment in vivo , and to remodel the matrix materials . Since one of the plates is ﬁxed to the x - y stage underneath , instead of reaching the minimum initial strain , the mechanism can be used to stretch the collagen matrix for an extended period before cells start to contract . In this process , embedded cells are stretched and elongated . This pre - treatment provides a solution for long / short period pre - stressed cells relaxation experiments . 2 . 2 . 3 Traction Force Microscopy ( TFM ) In 1980 , Harris et al [ 57 ] found the interesting fact that when cells are cultured on a very thin silicon substrate , the cell traction force generates a visible wrinkling on the substrate surface due to the locomotion . Initially , these wrinkles were used to estimate how many traction forces cells generated . It also can be applied to determine if a speciﬁc area of cells are contractile [ 58 , 90 ] . However , this approach has limitations for determining the speciﬁc amount of forces and directions of cell contraction , although a few modiﬁcations have been made to adjust the measure - ment technique [ 16 , 49 , 123 ] . Pelham and Wang [ 126 ] ﬁrst invented the method of using polyacrylamide material as a deformable substrate and putting cells dyed with ﬂuorescent labelling antibodies onto the substrate to examine cell locomotion . Still , the method is not calibrated to determine the actual traction force . Munevar and co - workers [ 117 ] have improved the technique by seeding large numbers of ﬂuores - cent micro - beads in the polyacrylamide substrate . Given the value of the elastic modulus of the substrate , traction forces of cells on the substrate can be estimated by tracking the displacement of ﬂuorescent micro - beads . Figure 2 . 5 illustrates the 26 calibrated traction force microscopy and its sequence of image processing . As cells can be seeded onto or in the polyacrylamide substrate , the technique has broadened the application of various cell types , both adherent and non - adherent cells . Those types include ﬁbroblast ( 3T3 1 ) [ 97 , 117 , 157 ] , smooth muscle cells [ 151 , 158 ] , osteoblast [ 26 ] , keratocyte [ 34 ] , dictyostelium [ 75 ] and HeLa cells [ 159 ] . Mostly , TFM is used to determine the magnitude of single cell contraction force [ 31 , 107 , 122 , 168 ] during locomotion [ 33 ] , migration [ 21 , 103 , 116 ] and development [ 30 , 94 ] . Moreover , TFM can be used as a tool to elucidate many pathological events caused by the traction force , such as apoptosis [ 157 ] , cancer [ 134 ] and hypertensive heart disease [ 106 ] . In addition , TFM has been applied further to investigate cytoskeletal changes [ 22 , 75 , 103 ] , focal adhesion [ 8 , 122 ] and cell shape changes [ 97 ] . Recently , scanning confocal microscopy [ 45 , 46 , 84 , 92 , 93 , 107 ] has been combined with TFM to perform a three - dimensional force scanning for single cell traction . The technique has provided a number of advantages . For instance , TFM is able to determine single cell traction force in a quantitative manner . The cell - gel interactions can also be seen and quantiﬁed . Various selections of ﬂuorescent microbeads allow for control of the area where cell traction events take place . However , this also leads to the disadvantage of the technique , which is that the resolution of contraction force entirely depends on the accuracy in gel elasticity measurement and camera spatial resolution . The measurement of elastic modulus of polyacrylamide substrate according to the report [ 102 ] is done by dropping a steel ball onto the substrate . Young’s modulus ( Y ) was determined by the modiﬁcation of Hertz contact theory as the following equation : Y = 3 ( 1   ⌫ 2 ) · f 4 · d 3 / 2 · r 1 / 2 ( 2 . 2 ) 1 3T3 refers to 3T3 protocol of transferring every 3 days and cell density at 3 ⇥ 10 5 cells / 20cm 2 dish . 27 ( a ) ( b ) Figure 2 . 5 : The working principle of traction force microscopy . ( a ) Schematic di - agram of widely used traction force microscopy . Cell sample is placed on top of polyacrylamide substrate where ﬂuorescent micro - beads are embedded . The entire gel matrix are placed onto a culturing plate ( i . e . , Petri dishes ) . ( b ) The typical TFM image analysis process ( modiﬁed from [ 117 ] ) . Scale bar , 20 µ m . 28 where Poisson’s ratio ( ⌫ ) is assumed to be 0 . 3 , f is the force that steel ball generated on the substrate ( steel ball is 7 . 2 g / cm 3 ) , d is measured indentation depth and r is the radius of the steel ball . As substrate deformation indirectly determines the traction force of the cell , it is necessary to examine the Young’s modulus of polyacrylamide substrate every time before the traction experiment . Secondly , the sti ↵ ness of the substrate will inﬂuence the contractility of cells onto / within the matrix . Cells have the ability to sense the substrate sti ↵ ness so as to remodel themselves to accommodate and compensate their behaviours , such as contraction [ 59 ] . Thirdly , the camera resolution will also inﬂuence the measurement of traction force as the micro bead movement is traced under the microscope . Lower resolution will lead to the centres of beads not being accurately tracked . Three - dimensional characteristic layers of gel would result in a di   culty for the camera to focus on di ↵ erent intersecting surfaces . 2 . 3 Atomic force microscopy Binning et al in 1986 invented a powerful tool , Atomic Force Microscopy ( AFM ) , to initially probe the mechanical property of surfaces in atomic scale [ 11 ] . Until recently , AFM has been broadly and extensively used as a bio - analytical tool to probe and manipulate the cellular dynamics , to analyse mechanical properties from tissue to molecule , and to map the topography of micro - substance . AFM belongs to the category of Scanning Probe Microscopes ( SPM ) which many review articles have introduced through its applications [ 13 , 69 , 162 ] since it began to be used in the 1980s . Atomic Force Microscopy aims to detect the attractive or repulsive force by a tip connected to the cantilever . The basic components of an AFM are illustrated in Figure 2 . 6 , which consists of a cone tip , a cantilever , a laser beam , a photodetector 29 Figure 2 . 6 : Basic constitution of Atomic Force Microscopy . During testing , signals are sent to move the system along z - axis . A laser beam was launched , reﬂected on the cantilever , and received at the photodetector . The voltage metre is able to detect the deﬂection of the laser on photodetector so as to determine the force magnitude . The cantilever is mounted with a cone tip at the front to probe the biological samples . 30 diode , and a z - axis piezo - stage . The output of the system would be the voltage versus z - axis displacement . The micro - fabricated cantilever tip requires remounting and calibration every time before the experiment as each tip has a distinctive sti ↵ - ness of silicon or silicon nitride probe . The ﬁnal output is plotted as force versus displacement . Various shapes of the front tip can be mounted with the cantilever , for instance , cone , pyramidal , spherical or ﬂat shape tip . Atomic Force Microscopy was originally designed to determine the Young’s moduli of biological samples and to generate high - resolution images of surface topog - raphy . Both applications share the similarity of testing procedures . At the start of testing , the cantilever tip and laser beam are calibrated ( calibration procedure can be found in chapter 6 . 2 . 2 ) . Force - Displacement curve is generated on one speciﬁc position of the sample drawing approaching and retraction of the tip . Mechanical models will be used to ﬁt the curve in order to ﬁnd out the Young’s moduli of the sample . If AFM is programmed to generate multiple Force - Displacement in one spe - ciﬁc area , a surface image can be mapped to each measurement point . AFM has been used to test single molecules [ 41 , 115 , 140 ] , nucleus [ 56 , 64 ] , cytoskeleton [ 128 , 135 ] , ECM sti ↵ ness [ 141 , 149 , 160 ] and cell elasticities [ 24 , 25 , 139 ] . The major challenge in AFM measurement technique is to determine the point of contact . When the tip approaches the sample very closely but not in con - tact , electrostatic force , electrical double layer ( EDL ) force , van der Waals force , and chemical force ( e . g . hydrogen bonding ) a ↵ ects the determination of actually contact - ing position , especially when AFM is used to manipulate molecules and nanoma - terials . Furthermore , the shape of tip and point of contact would ultimately a ↵ ect the nature of Force - Displacement curve . Results vary by using di ↵ erent commercial AFM . 31 2 . 4 Aims and objectives The primary aim of this study is to examine cellular contraction force of ﬁbroblast and adhesion force of HK2 cells in a quantitative manner . More speciﬁcally , to examine the contraction force of ﬁbroblast , the study develops a novel biomechanical testing platform to examine the mechanical property of bio - materials . The model is based on the modiﬁcation of cell - embedded collagen matrix . A 3D static contraction model is developed to characterise the contraction force in vitro ( Chapter 4 ) . As the model is based on the cell - embedded collagen matrix , the matrix e ↵ ect on the ﬁbroblast contraction is also discussed ( Chapter 5 ) . Furthermore , the study also focuses on the AFM single cell force spectroscopy to characterise cell - to - cell adhesion force ( Chapter 6 ) . The main objectives are listed as follows : • To develop a cell contraction model based on the ﬁbroblast - embedded collagen matrix . • To develop and test micro - indentation instrumentation to examine the me - chanical characteristics of collagen gel matrices . • To examine cell contraction force of ﬁbroblast based on the cell - embedded collagen matrices . • To quantify the agonist triggered single cell contraction force . • To investigate matrix sti ↵ ness e ↵ ect on ﬁbroblast contraction force by the micro - mechanical testing method . • To examine Ketamine - induced loss of cell - to - cell adhesion energy by a new approach derived from AFM single cell force spectroscopy . 32 Chapter 3 A novel nano - biomechanical tester In this chapter , a novel instrumentation of a biomechanical tester will be described . There will be an overall introduction to metrology and industry , followed by a de - tailed description of each component including their speciﬁcations , calibration proce - dures and integrated software development . It aims to provide repeatable procedures for the design and building of the novel instrument . 3 . 1 Introduction to micro - mechanical metrology In the modern engineering discipline , the fabrication and manufacture of sensors have a tendency to minimise the size of products . The accuracy and resolution of instruments , however , have increased to meet the requirement of the highly - precise design of materials , such as biomaterial . It can be predicted that the sub - µ m or even nanometre precision could become popular since the emergence of interdisciplinary research , such as nano - biomechanics and nanomaterials . Finer details are required 33 for investigation , including shape , surface roughness , porosity , and Young’s modulus in the precision engineering . Nano - technology has followed the success of micro - technology . Research in nanoscale has been undergoing tremendous growth since the nanoscale has become increasingly important for advanced bioscience and biotechnology . For example , materials like polymers , metals , and ceramics used for medical purposes have been characterised in nanometres . In regards to the biomechanical metrology , a major - ity of measurements are aimed to perceive detailed parameters of molecules , cells or tissues , such as sti ↵ ness , elasticity , and viscosity . To acquire the mechanical property of a target substance , depth - sensing indentation testing can provide useful information related to the deformation behaviour of materials . Metrology is regarded as the key step in any manufacturing process . Ba - sic metrology provides the dimension , geometries and other standard parameters of measurement . More sophisticated quantiﬁcation of property metrology could be realised since the measurement precision has improved . In the last three decades , several state - of - the - art metrological tools have been developed to characterise me - chanical properties of non - biological / biological materials at micro / nano - scale in - cluding : • Scanning probe microscopy , • Optical coherence tomography , • Optical di ↵ raction microscopy , • Digital holography , • Micro - computer tomography . These micro / nano - dimensional metrological tools give a clear outline of in - 34 terferometric solutions to acquire basic static parameters of materials . However , modern technology has capabilities to measure the dynamic properties of materials , such as electrical , thermal , magnetic and mechanical characteristics . In this chapter , a novel biomechanical tester will be introduced to broaden a means to detect me - chanical properties of biological samples . The tester is mainly used to characterise biological cells and tissues . Its hardware and software designs will be described in the following system calibration and experimental procedures . 3 . 2 Hardware design 3 . 2 . 1 Force transducer General information The major function of the system is to detect a force - depth curve of a single bio - logical cell so as to determine the deformation behaviour , sti ↵ ness , elasticity and viscoelasticity . The main part of the system is the force sensing element . The force transducer used for detection was based on the capacitance changes of capacitors which were mounted with a cantilevered fused silica beams . Figure 3 . 1 shows the electronic conﬁguration of the force transducer ( 400A - 407A series from Aurora Scientiﬁc Inc . Canada ) . As the charges of two capacitors ( C force and C reference ) are equal , it implies that no reacting force is applied from outside . Only while the indenter is in contact with the target materials does the subtraction of C force and C reference become non - zero , which means the system will generate current propor - tionately to the detector circuitry block . The current signals are then converted into the voltage signal by the block ( di ↵ erential trans - impedance ampliﬁer ) . After a di ↵ erence ampliﬁer and a bu ↵ er ampliﬁer , the signal will ﬂow through as linearised voltage output as Figure 3 . 1 shows . 35 Figure 3 . 1 : Schematic diagram of force transducer electronic block . It is worth pointing out that before the current signals are passed to the block of a di ↵ erential ampliﬁer , the 1 . 1 MHz oscillator is also driven by the signals . This function allows the system to be thermally stable . When the temperature changes occurred the reference capacitor , the current signal will increase simultaneously . Hence , the voltage through the oscillator control block is a ↵ ected by the current variation , which will then cause the control block to reduce the oscillation amplitude in order to ﬁnish the compensation of temperature for the sensing element . The transducer ( 406A ) can provide force resolution of 10 nN , which is the best force resolution compared with other modes in the 400A - 407A series ( see Table A . 2 in the appendix ) . The model o ↵ ers a force sensitivity of 0 . 05 mN volt   1 which is ideally and su   ciently for individual cell / tissue characterisation . Meanwhile , a satisfactory cylindrical ﬂat indenter was mounted upon the lower head of the force transducer . Figure 3 . 2 shows the top and side view of the force transducer with its dimensions . There are three possible coupled forces directions that will be applied to the transducer . Arrow a   a entails the ideal sensing 36 ( a ) ( b ) Figure 3 . 2 : Schematic view of force transducer . ( a ) top view ; ( b ) side view . Length in unit mm . 37 direction of force transducer . Forces on arrow b   b or c   c will not be sensed by the force transducer . The indenter , therefore , should be aligned with arrow a   a so that the full output from the force transducer can be perceived while deforming the target objects . Cylindrical ﬂat punch A modiﬁed indenter tip is the key to sensing the applied force onto the materials . Not only the tip surface will a ↵ ect indenter in contact with samples , but also modelling indentation process will be di   cult if the shape of the tip is not smooth . As shown in Figure 3 . 2b , the force transducer is mounted with a ﬁne glass probe with 1 mm diameter and 7 mm in length . However , the probe is tubular which means that is not suitable to indent soft materials . A lid was required to cover the hollowed - out probe so that the entire cylindrical punch formed . The reason to use a cylindrical ﬂat punch is because the fabrication and installation process is simple which only requires a ﬂat lid to mount with force transducer whilst other types of lid such as cone or spherical ones comes with a special mounting process which does not ﬁt with the current system set - up . The ﬂat lid will be the part in contact with the samples during experiments . Since the force transducer is very sensitive and fragile , any overloaded force will damage the force transducer . A precise procedure was carefully designed to assemble a circular lid onto the hollow cylindrical probe . Hard non - reﬂective polymer material was chosen to fabricate the lid . The reason for choosing the hard polymer is that the material is easily acquired and the surface is relatively smooth compared with metal . The mechanical strength is strong enough to compress the cells without self - deformation . One of the most prominent advantages is that polymer is easily carved and shaped . The probe on the force transducer as shown in Figure 3 . 2 dictates the lid should be a circular shape . The 38 diameter should be slightly larger than 1 mm . The probe covered with a wider radius lid could physically prevent the contamination towards the force transducer . Since a ﬂat polymer lid is used as the cover to the indenter in the system , the indenter generally works as a cylindrical ﬂat punch . Other possibilities like spherical and cone shaped indenters were also considered options . However , the fabrication and mounting procedure of them will most likely damage the force transducer . After selecting the appropriate material and shape , the next step was to attach the lid onto the probe . Two major factors were considered in the process of glueing the lid . Firstly , the procedure should not harm the force transducer . It was planned to gradually move the probe downwards to be in contact with the binding agent and then ﬁrmly attach it to the tip . Secondly , due to further experiments being performed at a temperature approximately 37 ￿ and in aqueous solution , the binding agent should be stable at this temperature . Otherwise , the lid might detach from the probe during the experiment . Wax was the recommended material for the binding agent . The melting point is around 60 ￿ and it is an ideal material to resist liquid medium . The procedure of mounting the lid onto the force transducer can be described in three stages : Firstly , the force transducer should be mounted properly with the step motor stage and lid cut into a round shape with proper diameter . Prepare a heating ring on the x - y stage and heat up the temperature exceeding the wax melting point . The wax should be completely melted into liquid . Move the force transducer with x - y - z direction until it touches the wax . Then move back to the beginning position and wait till the wax nearly solidiﬁed . The residual wax on the probe was selected as the binding agent . Secondly , place the well - cut lid on the x - y stage . Identify the contacting 39 position between the probe and lid from computerised software . Use the inverted microscope to validate the position . It also needs to make sure that the probe and lid are centrally aligned . Here , it is worthy of notice that changing the focus length of the microscope may provide a clearer look at both probe and lid so as to micro - adjust the central position . Thirdly , lift up the force transducer in the z - axis direction . Small adhesion force from the wax may help to keep the lid bonded to the probe , but the adhesion force was not enough . The lid was well - attached and properly positioned . The heating ring was placed on the x - y stage again . Then lift downwards the force transducer for the second time to the touching point with x - y stage . Open the heating ring until the temperature of the wax reaches the melting point . Next , the lid was at the right position and wax has melted . The melted wax can be seen under the microscope . It was necessary to give a small displacement downwards ( approximately 5 µ m ) to make sure that the lid was ﬁrmly attached . Then turn o ↵ the heating ring and wait until the room temperature reached . Hold the contacting status for about 5 minutes . During the holding process , it can be observed that the forces will be changing continuously . It was because the temperature drops perpetually , which leaded to the x - y stage deformation . Hence , it was a good practice to keep the force constantly ( over 300 µ N ) to make sure that the lid was stationary . Finally , the lid was successfully attached . Next move upwards the force transducer . During experiments , the lid was ﬁxed without detachment or shift . If the lid was contaminated or broken during the experiment , it was fairly easy to change the lid only by melting the wax and lift up the force transducer and do the process again with a new lid . Figure 3 . 3 shows the side and top view of the tip after the lid is attached on the force transducer . 40 ( a ) ( b ) Figure 3 . 3 : Schematic diagram of force transducer probe with the lid . ( a ) side view ( b ) top view . Scale bar , 1 mm . 3 . 2 . 2 Motorised stages A precise motorised stage is one of the key components to generating micro - or nano - level translation . Step moving resolution directly dictates the accuracy of the displacement during measurement . In the project , the system copes with three - dimensional displacements so as to locate precisely the target materials / cells . With the aid of a CCD camera and visual lens , it is easy to locate the cell by sending commands to the system . Essentially , the x - y axis and z - axis step motorised stage will assist to move the Petri dish and force transducer respectively to the targeted positions . The resolution for x - y and z axis stage are 100 nm . There are three major factors for a good stage , which are metric accuracy , resolution and repeatability . Fundamentally , the requested value should match with the actual value to a maximum extent , that is , metric accuracy deﬁned in linear 41 motion devices . The reproduction of same output is another important factor for routine measurement which is deﬁned by the repeatability . The resolution of the x - y stage is the original design from the factory . The speciﬁcation and performance of the stages will be introduced in the calibration section 3 . 4 . 2 . xy - axis stage The motorised x - y control system includes an Interactive Control Centre Joystick ( ICCJ ) ( PS3J100 Control Centre , Prior Scientiﬁc ) , a modular system ( ProScan ™ III , Prior Scientiﬁc ) and a high precision motorised stage ( H117 - series ProScan ™ , Prior Scientiﬁc ) as shown in Figure 3 . 4 . ICCJ is a central position controlling accessory , which has an instant response to user’s manipulation . The screen has a feedback to the intricate operation . For example , the stage can move diagonally because the x - axis servomotor underneath the stage can be triggered for only x - axis motions . The cubic black box is integrated with a modular system . The box controls stages of two directions and operates them simultaneously , i . e . with zero delays . The size is extremely small with the footprint of only 177 ⇥ 177 mm 2 . If the stage system cooperates with ﬂuorescence microscopy , the cubic box can be similarly used to control the excitation ﬁlter wheel . The third component is the x - y stage which is manipulated by the modular system . This stage is speciﬁcally designed to be integrated with inverted microscopes . With the travel range of 114 ⇥ 76 mm ( in x and y directions respectively ) and 400 steps for a single resolution , the x - y stage is ideal to achieve motions at micro - scales . z - axis stage The z - axis stage was directly connected with the force transducer and controlled the indentation depth . It was also required to deliver high resolution , metric accuracy 42 Figure 3 . 4 : Schematic diagram of Prior Scientiﬁc xy - axis stage and its controlling units . and repeatable measurements . Step motor linear stage ( UTS 100CC , Newport ) with its motion controller ( ESP 301 , Newport ) is employed . The whole unit has long travelling range of up to 100 mm with maximum speed of 40 mm sec   1 . The resolution and minimum incremental motion are 0 . 1 µ m and 0 . 3 µ m respectively . It can bear 20 , 000 hours loads of 5 kg and 30 % duty cycle . 3 . 2 . 3 Data acquisition The system obtains the force and displacement reading from separate routes . The motorised stage was connected with host PC via USB 2 . 0 communication link , which was simply plug - and - use pattern . The serial port setting is introduced in the soft - ware design session ( Chapter 3 . 3 ) . The signal coming from the force transducer was a form of analogue input . The data would then be transferred into a computer via terminal I / O block , which was a 68 - pin terminal block with SCC expansion slots ( National Instrument , UK ) connected with E - series DAQ ( Data Acquisition ) device 43 Figure 3 . 5 : Schematic diagram of Newport z - axis stage . Left is controlling unit ( ESP 301 ) and right is z - axis motorised linear stage ( UTS 100CC ) 44 as shown in Figure 3 . 6b . The SCC - 68 block connector has four SCC modules for integrating multiple input signals . The connection of force transducer into PC host can be summarised in following three steps . 1 . Find the output cable from the transducer ( from ‘OUT’ dot to the terminal block on Figure 3 . 6a ) . Expose one end of the cable and attach them to NO . 68 and 24 on SCC - 68 , which refers to AI 0 and AI GND as shown in Figure A . 4 in the appendix . The signals can then reach the breadboard area for I / O signal connection . This terminal has integration with computerised DAQ software that can simply acquire force transducer’s readings . The next step is to connect with the PC host . 2 . Attach the SCC - 68 to the computer using MIO connector as Figure 3 . 6b shows . The cable connects 68 pins terminal block with 100 pins E - series PCI receiver ( PCI - 6036E , National Instrument , UK ) . The PCI receiver has sixteen 16 - bit data acquisition channels and streams to disc at rates up to 200 kilo samples sec   1 . The number of channels and streaming rate is su   cient for force signal acquisition . 3 . Finally , Figure A . 2 , A . 3 and A . 4 in the appendix show the name of each port for the application of data acquisition . The Labview controlling panel can easily discover the corresponding connection panels and mechanism , which will be introduced later in software design session . In terms of the power supply of the connector block , if the SCC - 68 was con - nected to the computer via PCI - DAQ board , there would automatically be + 5 V power provided by the DAQ device that would be su   cient for low - power consump - tion use . The voltage would be distributed to all components in the connector block . However , if the power supply was not enough or there is a shortage of voltage due to an unstable computer PCI card , users can optionally use the SCC - 68 power supply module to generate the power . The external power supply module shown in the 45 ( a ) ( b ) Figure 3 . 6 : I / O connection pathway of acquiring data from force transducer . ( a ) Analogue voltage signals generated from force transducer are transmitted and con - verted into PC via controlling block , terminal block and DAQ . ( b ) Connection of I / O block and computer host . 46 Figure A . 3 item 4 will be an alternative to support the system . The external power supply cable was required and the maximum input voltage should be limited to 15 volts . Exceed voltage would have a negative inﬂuence on the circuit and damage the device . 3 . 3 Software design After the hardware was properly built , it was necessary to design the software to control the individual components from di ↵ erent manufacturers to work in coor - dination . The ultimate aim of the software programming was to develop a stable hardware controlling and data recording system . The only component needing to be manipulated was the z - axis stage . There were two primary parameters that were required to be logged that are the displacements from z - axis and forces from the force transducer . The data were recorded as a data matrix and displayed as plots by the software . Labview ( National Instruments , UK ) is a programming language for system designing . The essential di ↵ erence between Labview and other assembly languages is that Labview is completely based on the graphical programming ( referred to as ‘G’ - language ) , also called data - ﬂow language . Each programme is regarded as a VI ( Virtual Instrument ) . Inside , users create di ↵ erent graphical block diagrams to realise action in demand and then pull those blocks together by drawing logical wires between them . Graphical block diagrams aim to represent the di ↵ erent parameters , algorithms , functions , DAQ ( data acquisition ) ports and so on . The ‘wires’ are used to propagate variables . While creating the block diagram and connector nodes , a corresponding front panel can be generated . The front panel serves as the user interface for deﬁning initial values , monitoring progress and displaying outputs . 47 The natural advantage of graphical programming is that it can clearly show the data ﬂow and the sequence of operating for each modular block . The language is designed to use for data acquisition , instrument control and automation where mon - itoring during a process is a critical requirement . In terms of the control interface , users can easily change the parameters and input instructions while the software is running . It is speciﬁcally applicable for the experiments requiring constant mea - surement , for example , the force and displacement measurement in the project . The initial input parameters and signals can be sent to the backstage from the front con - trolling interface . The algorithm and sequences are working in the backstage . All the novel designs and principles will be introduced in this chapter . For the software design , Figure 3 . 7 shows the schematic diagram of general data ﬂow and connection ports . The virtual instrument refers to the central Labview programme . A force transducer was connected via PCI / DAQ port . DAQ assistants were embedded with Labview software as shown in Figure A . 5 and A . 6 , which coop - erates with SCC - 68 terminal connector . Users were able to extract force transducer inputs with speciﬁed sampling frequency and output format ( continuous ) . Reading force input was relatively more straightforward compared to z - axis controlling and logging as the data ﬂow from the transducer to PC was a one - way direction . The virtual instrument only reads voltage signal without sending instructions back . However , the major challenge was to control and acquire data from z - axis stage . The virtual instrument should be capable of sending instructions to the device at the some time as receiving the readings from z - axis stage . The default communication interface of the ESP 301 controller was through 4 - pin USB 2 . 0 con - nector located on the rear panel . Table 3 . 1 suggests the allocation of pins to provide power and transmit data . Due to the characteristic of dual channel communication , it was possible to control and receive data at the same time . The USB interface should be conﬁgured properly before the device starts communication . Labview se - 48 Figure 3 . 7 : Data ﬂow of system input and output .

Function description 1 VCC + 2 Data out 3 Data in 4 GND rial port sub - VI was established for communication . The system only works with 32 - bit Windows - 7 ( Microsoft , US ) operating system . The conﬁguration was ﬁxed at the 921 , 600 baud rate , 8 bits data , 1024 bu ↵ er size , no parity and 1 stop bit as shown in Figure A . 7 . The serial port number was found by checking the device manager in Windows OS . The software was designed block by block . The aim was to manipulate the z - axis stage to a preset position and then move back to the initial value while recording displacement and force values . This moving pattern was called loading and unloading . According to user’s manual of ESP 301 motion controller , the com - mand pattern was speciﬁed by simply sending command syntax to the controller . Depending on the command , the system decodes and decides the motion . In Lab - view , ‘concatenate strings function’ palette is selected as the package to deliver a command to the controller . Figure 3 . 8 introduced the experimental procedure and the sequence of how the software works . The ﬁrst step was to recognise the initial value and starting point . Command ‘DH’ - referred to as deﬁne home is used to set the current position as home . After setting the motor speed by command ‘VA’ ( setting velocity ) , the indentation depth was keyed in by command ‘PA’ ( move to absolute position ) . 50 The software then initiated the next block which contains two parts of commands , namely the reading loop and the indentation . The indentation was monitored by a continuous query loop to check if the position is reached by command ‘MD’ ( read motion done status ) . Meanwhile , a reading loop was recording the system time and current position from the serial port . The unloading part was similar to the loading procedure despite their opposite directions in displacement . To move reversely , the system was only required to recognise the ‘home’ position as the destination . After integrating the data acquired from the force transducer , the software was ended by the stop motion command ‘ST’ . 3 . 4 System calibration The calibration of each component of the nano - biomechanical tester is introduced in this chapter . It mainly aims to verify the components’ accuracy compared with factory defaults so as to validate the experimental data . The basic calibration procedure is to compare a known standard physics value with the output measured from the system . Forces from the transducer are determined by the mass of paper strips . Displacements of the motorised stage are calibrated by a laser distance meter . The calibration devices all have higher resolution than each component of the tester to ensure the overall performance of individual parts in the system . In this section , every component of the system will be calibrated and explained with real experimental data . 3 . 4 . 1 Calibration of force transducer The purpose of calibrating the force transducer was mainly to determine linearity , sensitivity and repeatability . It is worth noting that the calibration of force trans - 51 Figure 3 . 8 : The ﬂow chart for basic experimental procedures of acquiring mechanical properties of samples . 52 ducer should be the last procedure before any experiment so as to eliminate the risk of contamination . Frequent calibration of the force transducer was also required as the sensitivity can be a ↵ ected by environmental changes such as temperature , humidity and duration of using the device . The calibration was performed right before each experiment to ensure the reliability of the experiment . The calibration of the force transducer was undertaken by placing a known mass on the tip of transducer and recording the output voltage . The minute paper strips were used as the known scales ( model 1702 , Sartorius ) . Figure 3 . 9 shows the labelled paper strips . Their mass was measured on an accurate and calibrated scale twice as shown in Table A . 4 . The average loading force can then be calculated as the mean of two measurements as indicated in the following equation : loading force ( µ N ) = average mass ( mg ) ⇥ 9 . 81 ( N kg   1 ) ( 3 . 1 ) The estimated masses of paper strips , therefore , were used as the reference masses . The masses were placed on the force transducer to perform calibration . Here , it is worthy of notice that the paper scraps needed to be placed horizontally to elimi - nate any unbalanced force that would have caused inaccuracy in force transducer . Nevertheless , the central point should be found ﬁrstly and then be placed with the piece of paper on the force transducer . The paper strips should be cut into a square shape so as to ﬁnd the central point straightforward . The output voltage is then recorded as Table A . 4 shows . Linearity and sensitivity Table A . 4 shows the mass measurement of paper strips versus the corresponding force output when the papers are placed on the transducer . Both mass and voltage have two readings that are obtained individually . The second set of data is acquired 53 Figure 3 . 9 : Labelled paper strips for calibration of force transducer . after the completion of the ﬁrst one . The linearity calibration was designed to obtain the relationship between output voltage and input mass . As Figure 3 . 10a shows , the black dots represent the measuring data . By using linear regression ﬁtting , the goodness of ﬁt reaches 0 . 9983 for R squared value and P value less than 0 . 0001 . It , therefore , can be decided that the force transducer are in ideal linearity response . The ﬁtting model can be represented as the following equation : Output voltage ( volts ) = 0 . 02565 ⇥ Loading force ( µ N )   0 . 2622 . ( 3 . 2 ) Figure 3 . 10b plots the residual between the ﬁtted line and measured data . The residuals are in the range of ± 0 . 4 volts . Compared with maximum output 10 volts , the residuals ( ± 4 % ) are in the acceptance range . After rearranging Equation 3 . 2 , the sensitivity of force transducer can be calculated accordingly as 38 . 9863 ( µ N volt   1 ) based on the Equation 3 . 3 . From Table A . 2 , the sensitivity of factory default is shown as 50 ( µ N volt   1 ) . However , the real sensitivity can be determined based 54 ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) Figure 3 . 10 : Performance of force transducer in linearisation . ( a ) Output voltage at di ↵ erent loading forces . Numbers are from Table A . 4 . R 2 - value and P - value in ( a ) were calculated based on the linear regression model .

The red line suggests the linear regression ﬁtting of residuals . 55 on the calibration as follows . Sensitivity = Loading force ( µ N ) Output voltage ( volts ) = 1 0 . 02565 = 38 . 9863 ( µ N volt   1 ) . ( 3 . 3 ) Repeatability Figure 3 . 10c provides the residuals of two output readings from Table A . 4 against the average loading force . All residuals are within the range of ± 0 . 1 volts along with the slope of the linear ﬁtted line close to zero , which clearly suggests the repeatability of force measurement can be trusted . 3 . 4 . 2 Calibration of z - axis stage The aim of calibration of the z - axis motorised stage was to determine the accuracy of displacement . The standard of assessing a motorised stage is based on its resolution , metric accuracy , and repeatability . The calibration procedures will be introduced accordingly . Figure 3 . 11 shows the calibration set - up . The stage was placed on a horizontal anti - vibration table . The laser transmitter ( XL - 80 , Renishaw , UK ) produces a stable laser beam and was used to detect the distance between itself and measurement optics . The measurement optics was tightly mounted on the stage . The laser detector was well calibrated and its measurement resolution ( 1 nm ) was two orders higher than the resolution of the UTS 100CC motorised stage ( 100 nm ) . The calibration procedures can be concluded as the determination of the metric accuracy , hysteresis and repeatability . 56 Figure 3 . 11 : Schematic view of z - axis motorised stage calibration set - up . Figure 3 . 12 : Performance of z - axis stage in its metric accuracy . The residuals between the machine data and real displacement are plotted against the device output . The x axis are plotted at scale of log 10 . 57 Metric accuracy The ﬁrst step of calibration was to measure the metric accuracy of z - stage . The results were concluded in Table A . 3 which represented three di ↵ erent incremental precisions of 0 . 001 mm , 0 . 01 mm and 0 . 1 mm . The residuals between real detection and the machine data were calculated and plotted on Figure 3 . 12 . From the diagram , it can be seen that the residuals between real data and machine controlled data were all less than 7 ⇥ 10   4 mm . A smaller amount of displacement will lead to less deviation , which was acceptable to the system . The mean of residuals was within 0 . 15 % of the average machine output , which clearly shows the performance of its metric accuracy . Hysteresis The hysteresis e ↵ ect on the system occurs when displacement exerts in two direc - tions . One of the planned experiments was called the loading and unloading experi - ment , which means the z - axis stage will move forward and then recover back to the original position . The calibration of the hysteresis e ↵ ect becomes crucial as this may directly a ↵ ect the accuracy of measurement . Two sets of calibration experiments are performed with the various incremental precisions of 0 . 0002 mm and 0 . 002 mm as concluded in Table A . 5 . It shows that the hysteresis e ↵ ect indeed exists in the system . With a higher amount of incremental steps , there will be greater hysteresis e ↵ ect . However , the residuals plotted on Figure 3 . 13 shows that the hysteresis ef - fect is relatively small compared with the resolution of motorised stage . Hence , the hysteresis e ↵ ect was reasonably negligible . 58 ( a ) ( b ) Figure 3 . 13 : Performance of z - axis stage in its hysteresis . The residuals between machine data and real displacement are plotted against the device output at di ↵ erent increment step ( a ) 0 . 0002 mm ; ( b ) 0 . 002 mm . 59 Repeatability Repeatability of the motorised stage decides if the system can perform repeatable experiments in a short period . The repeatability examination was completed by moving the stage from home to a given distance ﬁve times . The data can be found in Table A . 6 . Figure 3 . 14 shows average residuals ± deviation between the ma - chine data and real displacement . All residuals are within the range of 2 . 5 ⇥ 10   5 mm . The data again suggests that the errors are in the acceptable range ( higher than manufacturer resolution ) and the system is capable of performing repeatable experiments . Figure 3 . 14 : Repeatability examination of z - axis stage . Data denotes the mean ± s . e . m of residual between system outputs and real displacements . 60 3 . 5 Experimental setup As shown in the Figure 3 . 15 , the system is mainly comprised of a force transducer ( 406A , Aurora Scientiﬁc Inc . ) attached with a cylindrical ﬂat punch or indenter ( ca 1 mm in diameter ) , z - axis step motor linear stage ( UTS 100CC with ESP301 Motion controller , Newport ) , xy - axis stage ( ProScan ™ III , Prior Scientiﬁc ) and a tempera - ture control heating plate ( Temp . Control , iBidi ) . All components are mounted on an inverted microscope ( TE2000 - S , Nikon ) and controlled by Labview software ( National Instrument ) . The system has ultimate force and displacement resolutions of 10 nN and 100 nm respectively . The force transducer senses the force via the cylindrical indenter . Mechanical properties of collagen gels were measured by the detailed system . Nanoindentation of collagen gel was performed at controlled in - dentation speed . Force and displacement were recorded simultaneously during the loading / unloading indentation cycles . The whole system was placed on an anti - vibration table ( Wentworth Laboratories Ltd . ) . After the system was built and calibrated , it was necessary to set up a stan - dard experimental protocol and make all components work in coordination . Fig - ure 3 . 16 illustrates the standard experimental procedure to characterise mechanical properties of biological samples . The mechanical characterisation of biological samples will be performed in vitro . Hence , the very ﬁrst step is to establish a physiological environment that is similar to the human body . The heating plate ( Temp . Control , iBidi ) was used to generate a 37 ￿ environment where sterile Petri dishes are placed on top . Biological samples are cultured in a 37 ￿ and 5 % CO 2 humidiﬁed incubator so that the Petri dishes and samples are preheated before experiments . To maintain the low CO 2 environment , during testing , all samples are immersed in the DMEM CO 2 - independent medium . The use of CO 2 - independent medium was necessary since the 61 ( a ) ( b ) Figure 3 . 15 : ( a ) Schematic of depth - sensing nano - indentation system for force - displacement measurement . ( b ) Image of nano - indentation system . 62 Figure 3 . 16 : The ﬂow chart for basic experimental procedures of acquiring mechan - ical properties of samples . 63 mechanical testing of biological samples was performed in the microscope without a CO 2 chamber . All experiments must be ﬁnished within a two hour period as the cells will become degraded from normal conditions . All cell culturing procedures and protocols are described in appendix A . The next step was xy / z - stage tuning . It aims to deploy the Petri dish to the view of the microscope by moving the xy - stage . Similarly , positioning the force transducer to target biological samples . The procedures should be operated man - ually and repeatedly . The localisation requires the combination of microscopy and force spectroscopy . Cell samples should be ﬂuorescently stained so as to visualise under the microscope since light through condenser was blocked by the force trans - ducer . In the project , cells were stained by fura - 2 AM , a ratio of metric calcium dye excited by 340 / 380 nm of light and 510 nm emission . The cells were pre - incubated with furo - 2 AM for 30 minutes before being washed twice with PBS . After force transducer and cells samples were aligned by checking under the microscope , force spectroscopy software was used to perform localisation of cell samples . The force transducer was moved downwards to approach the cell samples . A force curve is generated simultaneously to observe the approaching process . The increment displacement step of z - axis stage should be limited to 50 µ m in order to prevent potential damage to the force transducer . A similar procedure can be applied to approach the surface of the Petri dish . The subtraction between the positions of the Petri dish base and indenter - cell contact point implies the average height of cell samples . The very last step before the measurement was to reset force transducer to zero manually . The loading and unloading software introduced in Chapter 3 . 3 was used to perform the mechanical measurement . The initial speed and indentation depth for approaching depends on the height of samples . Normally , the entire period of 64 loading and unloading should be in the range of 90 to 120 seconds . The speed and depth can be calculated accordingly . The software will then control z - axis stage to move downwards and upwards . The data recording proceeds separately to acquire displacement and force signals . Finally , the system will generate Force - Displacement curve in Labview and create a text ﬁle for further data analysis . 65 Chapter 4 Measurement of ﬁbroblast contraction force Thanks to the development of nano - biomechanical test ( see Chapter 3 ) , cell contrac - tion force of ﬁbroblast can be measured based on an improved assay of cell - embedded collagen matrix . In parallel , a theoretical model has been established to calculate cell contraction force based on gel elasticity , thickness and radius . Histamine ( 100 µ M ) was used to stimulate human aortic adventitial ﬁbroblast contraction while the myosin light chain kinase inhibitor ML - 7 ( 25 µ M ) was used to inhibit cell contrac - tion . The collagen matrix used in the model provides a physiological environment for ﬁbroblast contraction studies . The study demonstrates that histamine can elicit a signiﬁcant increase in contraction force of ﬁbroblasts embedded in collagen , while the Young’s modulus of the gel decreases due to the gel degradation . 66 4 . 1 Introduction The collagen contraction assay was ﬁrstly reported by Bell et al [ 6 ] and has been de - scribed as ﬁbroblast - populated collagen lattice ( FPCL ) . The mechanism for ﬁbrob - last contraction is mediated by the control of myosin light chain ( MLC ) phosphory - lation status through the action of MLC kinase ( MLCK ) [ 40 ] . As reviewed by Dallon and Ehrlich [ 27 ] , raised intracellular calcium levels leads to calmodulin - dependent MLCK activation , which results in MLC phosphorylation and actin - myosin cross - bridge formation and ﬁlament sliding . Human aortic adventitial ﬁbroblasts ( HAoAF ) are resident in the adventi - tia of the aorta and they have been employed in experimental models of arterial remodelling and restenosis [ 153 ] . Histamine is an agonist that elicits increases in in - tracellular calcium and is released by basophils and mast cells during inﬂammatory responses . It acts on cells via a family of G protein - coupled histamine receptors , histamine receptor H1 through H4 . Several studies have shown that human ﬁbrob - lasts express H1 receptor and can be activated via histamine binding , resulting in phospholipase C activation and production of inositol triphosphates ( IP3 ) and di - acylglycerol ( DAG ) [ 79 , 98 ] . The increase of IP3 causes calcium release from the internal stores and consequently triggers ﬁbroblast contraction via activation of MLCK [ 66 ] . Several approaches have been developed to measure cell contraction forces in vitro ; among these , collagen gel contraction assay ( CGCA ) and traction force mi - croscopy ( TFM ) are the most common techniques . For the both methods , cell con - traction forces are measured indirectly based on measurement of the deformation of the matrix surrounding the cells , such as a cell - embedded collagen gel or cell - seeded polymer substrate . However , the CGCA technique is used for the measurement of forces in populations of cells , while TFM is more suited for the measurement of 67 forces in single cells . When CGCA is used for assessing contraction forces , cells are embedded within the collagen matrix , which provides cells with a physiological environment . Collagen is a key component of the extracellular matrix that facilitates cell migration and contraction [ 1 ] . Cell embedded collagen gels are easily constructed and the measurement of their contraction is straightforward . Conventional techniques used to measure collagen gel contraction rely on imaging only the gel area from a top - view . The estimation of contraction is often expressed by the area changes of the gels between the beginning and end of the treatment or cell contraction period [ 77 , 167 ] . To improve the measurement of cell contraction kinetics for time - dependent changes , time - lapse - video - based imaging techniques have been developed to record changes in gel areas continuously while the cells contract [ 119 ] . Although the versatility of the CGCA method facilitates general use , it does not provide quantiﬁcation of cellular contraction forces , since the mechanical properties of the collagen matrix will dictate the measurement accuracy of the cellular contraction forces . The elasticity of the disk - shaped collagen gel can be inﬂuenced by the cell treatments and the same amount of gel radius shrinkage may result from very di ↵ erent cellular contraction forces . Moreover , in the normal physiological environment , cells do not merely contract in a two - dimensional manner , therefore measuring the radius of gel disc only from the top view will not provide an accurate assessment of the magnitude of cellular contraction . Alternatively , TFM was developed to measure single cell contraction forces by observing the underlying elastic polymer substrate ( e . g . polyacrylamide gel ) embed - ded with multiple ﬂuorescence microbeads [ 17 , 33 , 168 ] . A number of mathematical models have been developed to facilitate the estimation of contraction force based on the relative motion of the beads . However , the sti ↵ ness of the gel substrate can be altered by cell di ↵ erentiation and biochemical treatments during the measurement 68 and this may a ↵ ect the accuracy of the force measurement . More importantly , it is more technically challenging to obtain results using the TFM method and measure - ments do not provide a true physiological model because the assessment of cellular contraction based on a 2D surface , instead of a 3D gel matrix . To improve the accuracy of CGCA force measurements , a culture force mon - itor ( CFM ) system was developed by attaching strain gauges at the edges of a cell - embedded collagen gel to directly assess cell contraction [ 19 , 32 , 36 , 37 , 47 , 86 ] . Cellular contraction force can be measured continuously without the inﬂuence of the elastic variation of collagen gel . Single cell contraction force can thus be ap - proximately estimated by the measured force divided by the total number of the embedded cells . However , the measurement was only limited to a random uniaxial stress as the strain gauges could only measure the contraction in single directions . Having taken into account the variation in the elasticity of the collagen ma - trix , we re - designed the collagen gel based assay technique to quantify cell contrac - tion forces with a signiﬁcantly higher degree of accuracy . The method essentially correlates the relationship between gel deformation and embedded cell contraction force . The elastic modulus and thickness of each collagen gel were routinely quan - tiﬁed by a bespoke nanoindentation tester and the data were used as input param - eters for a simple mathematical model that correlates cell contraction force with gel properties , including radius , thickness , and elasticity , which varied throughout the di ↵ erent treatments . The single cell contraction force can also be determined providing that total cell number embedded in the gels are known . In this study , we have also applied the new gel - based sensing technique to investigate the contraction force of HAoAF treated with the agonist histamine or following co - treatment with ML - 7 , a well - established inhibitor of MLCK , to attenuate ﬁbroblast contraction . 69 4 . 2 Material and methods 4 . 2 . 1 Cell culture Cryopreserved Human Aortic Adventitial Fibroblasts ( HAoAF ) were purchased from PromoCell GmbH at passage 2 . Cells were cultured at 37 ￿ in a 95 % air / 5 % CO 2 atmosphere using phenol red - free Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with Fetal Calf Serum ( FCS , 10 % ) , penicillin ( 100 IU ml   1 ) , strepto - mycin ( 100 µ g ml   1 ) and L - Glutamine ( 2 mM ) . Cells at passage 7 to 9 were used in all experiments . 4 . 2 . 2 Collagen gel contraction assay Collagen gel assay Conﬂuent HAoAF cultures were detached from ﬂasks using trypsin / EDTA and cell number determined using a haemocytometer . After centrifugation , cells were re - suspended in DMEM containing 10 % FCS at densities of between 0 . 5 ⇥ 10 6 and 2 . 5 ⇥ 10 6 cells ml   1 and mixed with culture medium containing collagen I ( rat tail , Corning , EU ) on ice at a ratio of 1 : 9 , resulting in the ﬁnal solution containing 1 . 76 mg ml   1 collagen type I , 2 mM L - glutamine , 100 IU ml   1 penicillin , 100 µ g ml   1 streptomycin and 5 % FCS . The pH level of the mixture is balanced by the 1M NaOH and 0 . 5M NaHCO 3 . The cell suspension was transferred into 35 mm Petri dishes ( 1 . 2 ml dish   1 , achieving cell densities between 0 . 06 ⇥ 10 6 and 0 . 3 ⇥ 10 6 cells gel   1 ) and incubated in a cell culture incubator for 20 minutes to polymerise the gel before addition of a further 1 . 5 ml DMEM containing 5 % FCS . After incubation for 16 hours , the culture medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 5 % FCS and collagen gels were dislodged from the edge of the dish using a sterile spatula . Gel 70 thickness and elasticity measurements were conducted 48 hours later . In experiments to address the e ↵ ects of histamine on cell contraction , ﬁbroblasts were re - suspended in DMEM containing 10 % FCS at a density of 1 . 8 ⇥ 10 6 cells ml   1 ( achieving a cell density of 0 . 216 ⇥ 10 6 cells gel   1 ) and incubated for 16 hours before treatment of cells in the presence or absence of the myosin light chain kinase inhibitor ML - 7 ( 25 µ M ) for 30 minutes . Some dishes were then stimulated with the agonist histamine ( 100 µ M ) to elicit cell contraction . Collagen gels were then immediately dislodged from the dish using a sterile spatula with gel thickness and elasticity measurements conducted 5 hours later . Experimental measurements A depth - sensing nanoindentation tester ( Figure 4 . 1a , details see Chapter 3 . 5 ) was developed to quantitatively measure the thickness and Young’s modulus of the cell - embedded collagen gel , which were used as input parameters to estimate contraction force ( see Section 4 . 3 . 2 ) . When the thickness and elasticity were measured , collagen gel was plated in the 35 mm Petri dishes with no culturing medium on the heating plate at 37 ￿ . Ten random positions were picked and measured to generate ten di ↵ erent Force - Displacement ( F - D ) curves for analysis . The gel indentation was performed at a controlled speed of 40 µ m sec   1 to generate the Force - Displacement curve . The thickness of the gel was measured based on the displacement di ↵ erence between the gel’s top surface and the Petri dish surface , while the gel elasticity was measured based on the analysis of the indentation F - D curves . The ﬁrst 25 - 30 % of the curve was extracted to determine Young’s modulus ( E ) by ﬁtting a non - linear strain dependent elasticity model as shown in Figure 4 . 1b . In parallel , a computerised camera has been used to measure the radius of the disk - shaped 71 ( a ) ( b ) Figure 4 . 1 : ( a ) The schematic setup of bio - nano - indentation tester . ( b ) Typical loading Force - Displacement curves of collagen gels with higher and lower sti ↵ ness indented by a ﬂat punch . 72 hydrogel , from the vertical top view , and the radius change before and after cell contraction can be determined by referencing the culturing area of Petri dishes . The measurement accuracy of the radius was up to 1 µ m . 4 . 3 Mathematical modelling 4 . 3 . 1 Young’s modulus of collagen gel The Young’s modulus of collagen gel is modelled by employing non - linear strain dependent elasticity [ 148 ] : E = E 0 · 1   ¯ ✏ + ¯ ✏ 2 3 ( 1   ¯ ✏ ) 2 ( 4 . 1 ) where E 0 is the Young’s modulus ( E ) at strain ¯ ✏ = 0 . To estimate the Young’s modulus , it is necessary to ﬁnd a suitable connection between F - D curve and the modulus . When a cylindrical punch indents a ﬂat elastic substrate ( collagen gel ) , a linear relationship derived from Hertz contact theory can be express as [ 80 ] : E ⇤ = F 2 rD ( 4 . 2 ) where E ⇤ is reduced modulus of collagen gel , r is the radius of cylindrical indenter , D is the displacement or depth of indenter into the collagen gel surface , and F is the force measured by the force transducer . For two elastic bodies in contact , the reduced modulus can be also described as following according to Hertz contact theory [ 60 ] : E ⇤ = [ 1   ⌫ 2 E + 1   ⌫ 2 i E i ]   1 ( 4 . 3 ) where ⌫ is the Poissons ratio and E is the Young’s modulus of indented collagen gel . The subscript i refers to the properties of cylindrical indenter . The values of ⌫ are in the range of 0 . 42 - 0 . 48 , which were calculated based on the measured radii and 73 thicknesses of the collagen gel disks before and after contraction . The indenter is regarded as perfectly rigid , i . e . , E i = 1 , and thus combining ( 4 . 1 ) , ( 4 . 2 ) and ( 4 . 3 ) , the following equation can be derived : F = E 0 · 2 rh 1   ⌫ 2 · ¯ ✏   ¯ ✏ 2 + ¯ ✏ 3 3 ( 1   ¯ ✏ ) 2 ( 4 . 4 ) For the strain ¯ ✏ can be approximately calculated as the ratio of the displace - ment of indenter to the measured thickness of the collagen gel , H , i . e . , ¯ ✏ = D / H . Hence , by using non - linear least square regression to ﬁt F ( ¯ ✏ ) with D based on the Equation ( 4 . 4 ) , the Young’s modulus E 0 of collagen gel can be estimated from each measured F - D curve . 4 . 3 . 2 A theoretical model to measure contraction force A simple theoretical model has been developed to estimate cell contraction force ( F ⇤ ) based on the force balance between cell contraction and gel deformation . As shown in Figure 4 . 2 , thickness ( h 0 and h 1 ) and radius ( r 0 and r 1 ) of a disk - shape collagen gel at the beginning and end of contraction . The Young’s modulus E of collagen gel is described by the linear elastic mechanics as : E = d   d " ( 4 . 5 ) where d   and d " represent stress and strain respectively , generated by cell contrac - tion to the gel . During the entire contraction process , the contraction force acts perpendicularly on the circumference surface which area can be expressed as 2 ⇡ r · h . Hence the stress d   can be calculated by radial contraction force d F per unit area 74 Figure 4 . 2 : Schematic of theoretical model for collagen gel before and after contrac - tion . as the equation : d   = d F ⇤ 2 ⇡ r · h ( 4 . 6 ) where r and h are the immediate radius and thickness of collagen gel . Correspond - ingly , the strain d " can be expressed as the deformation of collagen gel at radial direction . d " = d r r ( 4 . 7 ) Hence , combing the equation ( 4 . 5 ) , ( 4 . 6 ) and ( 4 . 7 ) , Young’s modulus E 0 can be expressed as : E = d   d " = d F ⇤ 2 ⇡ h · d r ( 4 . 8 ) Here , the average thickness can be expressed as h = h 0 + h 1 2 if the gel thickness change is approximately linear during the contraction process . After rearranging the equation ( 4 . 8 ) with integration , the ﬁnal overall contraction force therefore can be presented as : F ⇤ = Z r 0 r 1 d F ⇤ = Z r 0 r 1 ⇡ E ( h 0 + h 1 ) d r = ⇡ E 0 ( h 0 + h 1 ) ( r 0   r 1 ) · 1   ¯ ✏ + ¯ ✏ 2 3 ( 1   ¯ ✏ ) 2 ( 4 . 9 ) 75 The model simply correlates the overall cell contraction force F ⇤ with the measured material parameters , including Young’s modulus , thickness , and radius of collagen gel . Single cell contraction force is approximately calculated as the overall contrac - tion force divided by the counted cell numbers . 4 . 4 Results 4 . 4 . 1 Young’s modulus of collagen gel Typical indentation curves and their corresponding non - linear ﬁtting curves are represented in Figure 4 . 3a . First 25 % of indentation depth to the gel thickness ( i . e . , strain up to 0 . 25 ) is selected to estimate Young’s modulus of collagen based on the minimum least square ﬁtting of the equation ( 4 . 4 ) with the experimental force - strain data . Figure 4 . 3b shows the Young’s modulus for HAoAF - embedded collagen gels for controlled gel and treated gel at the cell density of 0 . 216 ⇥ 10 6 ( cells gel   1 ) . After the treatment with histamine , the Young’s modulus of collagen gels were decreased by 41 . 2 % compared with the untreated ones , while treatment with ML - 7 shows the gently inhibitory e ↵ ect of decreasing elasticity ( ca 59 . 3 % ) . 4 . 4 . 2 HAoAF contraction force after histamine and ML - 7 treat - ment The images shown in Figure 4 . 4b and c demonstrate the shrinkage of the HAoAF - embedded collagen gels treated by histamine with / without ML - 7 compared with the untreated gel ( Figure 4 . 4a ) . The shaken gel sizes / radii can be calculated by counting the pixels of the gel images referencing the culturing area of Petri dishes . By substituting the measured radius , Young’s modulus and thickness of collagen gels into the equation ( 4 . 9 ) , HAoAF contraction force can then be estimated .

As a result , the cell densities within the gels can be assumed to have no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the single cell contraction force measurements . 4 . 5 Discussion This chapter describes a novel method to assess cellular contraction force in vitro using a collagen gel - based sensing technique to demonstrate cell contraction force changes in ﬁbroblasts treated with the agonist histamine , which increases intra - cellular calcium to elicit contraction , and attenuated by the MLCK inhibitor ML - 7 . It is worth highlighting that conventional collagen gel contraction assays have been mainly based on the observation of the change of cell - embedded collagen gel area [ 173 ] , although a few studies have included measurement of the gel thick - ness [ 88 ] . However , the Young’s modulus of the gel should be regarded as one of the key parameters required to estimate the cell contraction force , as described math - ematically by the equation ( 4 . 9 ) . The result ( Figure 4 . 3 & 4 . 5 ) demonstrates the signiﬁcant increase in cell contraction force after histamine treatment , despite the Young’s modulus of collagen gel decreasing . Since the treatment conditions or state of cell di ↵ erentiation may alter the gel elastic modulus , careful characterisation of the gel elasticity before and after the culturing period are critical to accurately determine the cell contraction forces . A signiﬁcant increase in single cell contraction force by histamine treatment has been demonstrated using this novel technique by combining nano - indentation with mathematical modelling of collagen gel contraction . As reported in the liter - ature [ 66 ] , histamine can elicit an extensive contraction of cells as measured using CGCA . However , adding ML - 7 , an MLCK inhibitor , to the collagen gel can signiﬁ - cantly attenuate the cellular contraction elicited by histamine , conﬁrming that the 80 ( a ) ( b ) Figure 4 . 6 : Cellular contraction force at di ↵ erent cell densities .

( b ) Single cell contraction force of the three cell densities . Data denote mean ± s . e . m from 4 independent measurements , P - value and R 2 - value in ( a ) were cal - culated based on the linear regression model . 81 ﬁbroblast contraction was mediated via MLC phosphorylation [ 109 ] . Overall , the order of magnitude of cell contraction forces measured using this novel technique was in the same order to those values determined by other methods , e . g . , CFM [ 19 , 48 ] . As shown in Figure 4 . 6 , single cell contraction force was demonstrated to be cell - density independent . As the histamine treated collagen gels were only allowed to contract for 5 hours before the measurement , the cell proliferation during this pe - riod was negligible , and cell numbers can be reasonably assumed to remain constant throughout the measurements . Single cell contraction force can be therefore calcu - lated by overall contraction force divided by known initial cell numbers . However , for longer - term measurement ( more than 24 hours ) in the cell - density contraction experiments , it was noticeable that cells were aligned on the bottom of the Petri dishes . This implies that there may be a potential cell - number loss and the collagen gel liquid content may be reduced [ 6 ] . Moreover , cell proliferation rate during long - term treatment could cause a signiﬁcant increase in cell number within the gels . Assessment of total DNA content would be a possible way to verify whether the ﬁnal cell numbers within the gels remain constant at the end of the assay . Nevertheless , from the results shown in Figure 4 . 6b , single cell contraction force can be calculated by the initial cell seeding number as there was no signiﬁcant force di ↵ erence measured between the di ↵ erent cell densities . We have shown that 0 . 1 ⇥ 10 6 cell gel   1 is an ideal cell seeding density for the long - term contraction force measurement while a higher cell seeding density , e . g . , 0 . 3 ⇥ 10 6 cell gel   1 will be de - sirable for shorter periods of measurement ( less than 24 hours ) . This is because with the same amount of cells embedded , contraction assays performed soon after seeding ( less than 6 hours ) will generate less overall contraction force than measurements taken after a longer period ( 24 hours ) due to cell proliferation . Therefore increasing cell seeding density provides a greater overall contraction force and result in more accurate measurements of cell contraction force . 82 The novel technique reported in this study is applicable to assess forces gen - erated by any cell type that can be cultured within a 3D collagen gel and responds to agonist stimulation leading to cell contraction . For example , assessment of forces elicited by vascular smooth muscle cells may indicate the likelihood of a treatment causing contractile responses that may lead to hypertension [ 166 ] while assessment of contraction forces in dermal ﬁbroblasts may provide insights in wound healing potential of drugs , anti - wrinkling properties of therapeutic compounds or suitabil - ity of 3D gel matrices for tissue engineering of skin substitutes [ 2 , 14 , 54 ] . These are only a few potential applications where the novel technique to assess cellular and gel contraction forces may provide important information for future bioengineering and clinically relevant therapeutic strategies . 4 . 6 Summary This chapter has demonstrated a novel technique to quantify cellular contraction force when cells are embedded in a three - dimensional collagen gel matrix . The histamine - induced contraction of ﬁbroblasts through MLCK activation and MLC phosphorylation , determined in cells seeded in a collagen gel , are in agreement with observations previously reported in literature [ 48 ] . The alteration in the collagen gel elasticity before and after histamine treatment was measured . The measurements have conﬁrmed that the mechanical property changes of the gel matrix should be taken into account to measure cell contraction forces accurately using gel contraction assays . 83 Chapter 5 Collagen matrix sti ↵ ness inﬂuences ﬁbroblast contraction force In the previous chapter , contraction force in human aortic adventitial ﬁbroblasts seeded within a 3D collagen matrix was quantiﬁed by a novel force sensing technique . Furthermore , in this chapter , the quantitative correlation between the Young’s mod - ulus of the collagen matrix and the ﬁbroblast contraction force has been studied by using the technique . 5 . 1 Introduction The culture of cells within 3D matrices has been used for several decades [ 55 ] . The behaviours of cells in tissue - like matrices , such as migration , contraction and prolifer - ation , exhibit an ideal model of their in vivo phenotype . Several materials have been 84 developed for the synthesis of cellular encapsulated hydrogels . Collagen , alginate , ﬁbrin and agarose are extensively used as the natural polymer ingredients to con - struct engineered tissue equivalents [ 1 ] . Among these , collagen has been recognised as one of the major components in connective tissues , which forms stable ﬁbrils and provides multiple cellular binding sites [ 7 , 124 ] . Fibroblasts are the main cell type that inﬂuence remodelling and biosynthesis of collagen ﬁbrils [ 55 ] . As the structure of collagen provides a mechanically stable framework , the contractile properties of ﬁbroblasts seeded within a collagen matrix provides a good model for investigating tissue physiology and pathology . Currently , one of the most prevailing techniques to obtain cellularised colla - gen gels is modiﬁed from the method of Bell et al [ 6 ] . Measuring the contraction of cells - embedded in 3D matrices is relatively straightforward using the conventional collagen gel contraction assay . When cells start to contract , the collagen matrix normally exhibits a noticeable reduction in size . However , previous studies using collagen gel - based assays to measure ﬁbroblast contractility were limited to only examining the changes in overall gel radius and hence an accurate determination of cell contraction force was di   cult to achieve . The concentrations of collagen used to form the gels reported in research studies are in di ↵ erent numbers . Therefore even a same degree of gel radius shrinkage does not provide an accurate representation of the same magnitude of contraction force , because the quantity of matrix sti ↵ ness needs to be considered in the determination of cellular contraction forces [ 2 ] . To date , there are very few reports demonstrating that the sti ↵ ness of collagen matrices can inﬂuence cellular contraction forces . At the site of vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis , arterial injury leads to enhanced adventitial ﬁbroblast contraction and changes in the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) contributing to vessel remodelling and restenosis [ 153 ] . Collagen ﬁbrils form a tightly aligned structure due to the synthesis of connective tissues following vessel 85 injury and inﬂammation . Fibroblasts can produce a large amount of collagen protein to increase the overall tissue tensile strength that contributes to vascular sti ↵ ening and impaired function [ 53 ] . The presence of di ↵ erentiated contractile myoﬁbroblast has been associated with the increase of ECM sti ↵ ness and they mediate the pro - duction of force for wound contraction [ 118 ] . The interaction between ﬁbroblasts and various ECM components has been investigated using a number of engineering tools . These methods include cell populated micropillar substrates [ 136 ] or Traction Force Microscopy ( TFM ) [ 17 , 33 ] . For both methods , cell contraction force is deter - mined indirectly based on the relative displacement of substrate materials , such as the deﬂections of micropillars or the movements of ﬂuorescence microbeads embed - ded polymer substrate . However , both of these methods do not provide an accurate assessment of cell behaviour as they only measure the contraction of ﬁbroblasts on a two - dimensional surface while the actual physiological environment in vivo for cell contraction within the extracellular matrix is three - dimensional . To overcome these challenges in the accurate measurements of cell contrac - tion force , we have recently developed a novel nanoindentation device to measure the gel elasticity , and in combination with mathematical modelling , cell contraction force can be determined accurately based on the measured thickness and area of a disk - shaped cell - embedded collagen matrix [ 78 ] . In this chapter , we have applied the new technique to investigate the e ↵ ect of collagen gel sti ↵ ness on cell contraction force in a quantitative manner . 5 . 2 Materials and methods Conﬂuent cultures of human aortic adventitial ﬁbroblasts ( HAoAF , PromoCell , Ger - many ) were detached from ﬂasks using trypsin / EDTA and cells were re - suspended in Dulbeccos Modiﬁed Eagles Medium ( DMEM ) containing 5 % Fetal Calf Serum 86 ( FCS ) . Cells were then mixed with culture medium containing collagen I on ice , to achieve a ﬁnal density of 2 . 16 ⇥ 10 5 cells gel   1 in DMEM containing 2mM L - glutamine , 100 IU ml   1 penicillin , 100 µ g ml   1 streptomycin , 5 % FCS and di ↵ erent collagen concentrations of 1 . 5 , 2 . 0 and 2 . 5 mg ml   1 . The collagen matrix with cell suspension was transferred into 35 mm Petri dishes ( 1 . 2 ml dish   1 ) and incubated in a culture incubator ( 37 ￿ , 5 % CO 2 ) for 20 minutes to allow gel polymerisation before addition of a further 1 . 5 ml DMEM containing 5 % FCS . After incubation overnight , the culture medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 5 % FCS . Some dishes were then stimulated with the agonist histamine ( 100 µ M ) to elicit cell contraction . Collagen gels were then immediately dislodged from the dish using a sterile spatula with gel thickness and elasticity measurements conducted 5 hours later . Histamine was employed in this study to elicit HAoAF contraction as it has been well characterised to act via G - protein coupled receptors . Upon activation , it triggers calcium release from the internal stores , leading to calmodulin - dependent myosin light chain ( MLC ) kinase activation resulting in MLC phosphorylation and subsequent actin - myosin crossbridge formation and cellular contractions [ 27 , 40 , 66 ] . I have demonstrated in the previous chapter that addition of histamine ( 100 µ M ) increased single HAoAF cell contraction force by two - fold and contractions were attenuated by treatment with ML - 7 , an inhibitor of MLC kinase [ 78 ] . Therefore , we used histamine ( 100 µ M ) in this study to elicit short - term contraction events in HAoAF . A depth - sensing indentation device was used to measure the thickness and Young’s modulus of the cell - embedded collagen gel . The ﬁrst 30 % of the curve was extracted to determine Young’s modulus ( E ) by ﬁtting a non - linear strain dependent elasticity model as shown in Figure 4 . 1b . The Young’s modulus E of collagen gel was determined from the measured Force - Displacement ( F - D ) curve ﬁtting with the 87 following non - linear mechanical equation [ 78 ] , which was derived based on Hertz contact theory [ 60 ] in combination with non - linear strain dependent elasticity ( see equation 4 . 4 ) [ 148 ] . 5 . 3 Results As illustrated in Figure 5 . 1a and Figure 5 . 1c , when ﬁbroblast starts to contract , the contraction force will lead to gel radius shrinkage with a concomitant change in thickness of the disk - shaped gel . The thickness and radius of collagen gel were measured at the beginning and end of treatment to determine the overall ﬁbroblast contraction force ( see Equation 4 . 9 ) . Ten random positions were measured to cal - culate average gel thickness ( shown in Figure 5 . 1b ) . The depth sensing indentation device was used to measure displacement di ↵ erence from the gel top surface to the Petri dish surface . The top view images of the disc - shaped collagen were captured and used to measure the gel radius before and after shrinkage by referencing the culture surface within the Petri dishes ( illustrated as Figure 5 . 1c ) . Figure 5 . 2a shows the results derived from measurement of Young’s moduli of both the treated and untreated gels , demonstrating a dose - dependent increase with collagen concentrations . Interestingly , histamine treatment slightly reduces the Young’s modulus of collagen gel compared with the untreated gels at the same collagen concentration . Figure 5 . 2b shows the overall contraction force of ﬁbrob - lasts which was calculated based on the Equation 4 . 4 using the measured geometric parameters and Young’s modulus of the gel . The result shows the contraction force decrease as the collagen concentration increases . It was evident that histamine treat - ments doubled overall contraction cell force in every concentration group . Figure 5 . 2c demonstrates that cell contraction force decreases monotonically as the gel con - centration increases . Histamine treated gels exhibited a signiﬁcant linear regression 88 ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) Figure 5 . 1 : ( a ) Schematic of geometric parameters of collagen gel were measured before and after contraction for calculating contraction force .

The Young’s modulus ( or sti ↵ ness ) of collagen gel , as calculated by the non - linear strain dependent mechanical model [ 80 , 148 ] , demonstrates a clear increase as the gel collagen concentration increases . The in - crease in the gel Young’s modulus regulated ﬁbroblast contraction force as the cell contractility was signiﬁcantly reduced in the sti ↵ er matrices . Moreover , the addition of the agonist histamine elicited signiﬁcant ﬁbroblast contraction forces . In all col - lagen concentration groups , the histamine treated ﬁbroblasts exhibited a two - fold increase in their contraction forces ( Figure 5 . 2b ) despite the decrease in Young’s modulus of the collagen gels ( Figure 5 . 2a ) . This proves the Young’s modulus of gel matrices should be considered as a key parameter to properly assess cellular contraction forces using gel - based assays . The results clearly demonstrate that the mechanical properties of collagen matrices inﬂuence the contractile responses of ﬁbroblasts . Cells in sti ↵ er ( higher Young’s modulus ) materials exhibit a signiﬁcant reduction in their contractility measured by our novel method , which is comparable to the results obtained by using other techniques , such as CFM [ 83 ] . For histamine - induced cell contraction assay , we showed a more signiﬁcant decrease of overall contraction force as the matrix sti ↵ ness increases . With the activation of myosin light chain phosphorylation mediated by the agonist histamine , cell contractility increases , however , ﬁbroblast contraction force will also be a ↵ ected by the interaction between the cells and the 91 collagen matrix . The detailed mechanisms of how the cells translate the sensing of substrate sti ↵ ness into the downstream signals for regulating contraction requires further biomechanical studies . In the blood vessel wall , inﬂammatory disease processes increase ECM col - lagen content thereby causing vascular dysfunction due to enhanced sti ↵ ness which impacts on the contractility of resident ﬁbroblasts . In the earlier reports , a loss of mass has been shown in ﬁbroblast collagen gel assays during cell contraction pro - cess [ 6 ] . This ﬁnding also implies that there were a potential loss in cell numbers in the collagen - gel - based contraction assay for long - term ( > 48 hours ) measurements . Hence , a certain degree of inaccuracy is likely generated in the determination of ﬁbroblast contraction force using previous techniques ( e . g . culture force monitor ( CFM ) [ 32 , 86 ] , because the mass and cell loss may cause alterations in the mechan - ical properties of the collagen matrix . However , since the treatment time in our current study is only 5 hours , there was likely to be no signiﬁcant loss of cells or gel mass . 5 . 5 Summary In a 3D collagen matrix , the cells exhibit di ↵ erent levels of contractility depending on the collagen gel sti ↵ ness . Agonist treatment on ﬁbroblast also have a ↵ ected the collagen matrix sti ↵ ness . The ﬁnding conﬁrms that the mechanical properties of the collagen matrix should be considered in the cellular contraction events . Overall , the study has shown the importance of matrix sti ↵ ness on cell contraction forces in the design of collagen - based biomaterials for clinical applications . 92 Chapter 6 Atomic force microscopy for cell - to - cell adhesion In the previous three chapters , the novel biomechanical tester was introduced , and it was successfully applied to measure cellular contraction force and probe hydrogel elasticity e ↵ ect . However , for cell - to - cell adhesion measurement , the bio - mechanical tester is not the best candidate as higher force resolution is required . So in this chapter , we have further used AFM force spectroscopy to examine cell - to - cell adhe - sion force . An established model cell line for human epithelial cells of the proximal tubule ( HK2 ) was used to demonstrate that Ketamine ( 0 . 1 - 1 mg mL   1 ) evokes the loss of adhesion force examined by AFM . 6 . 1 Backgrounds Atomic Force Microscopy ( AFM ) technology has been widely applied in biomedical researches since its discovery in the 1980s [ 11 ] . Due to the high precision , it has been used to characterise many micro and nanobiological materials . In the tra - 93 ditional way , AFM’s cantilever serves as a probe to indent the cell and to obtain Force - Displacement curves which can be used to determine the local mechanical properties of the sample ( background information introduced in chapter 2 . 3 ) . The measurement of cell - to - cell adhesion force is challenging in cell biology studies as it demands high precision and easy manipulation . Many disciplines have been inter - ested in the measurement of cell - to - cell adhesion , including cell migration , wound healing , and regenerative medicine . Most recent studies regarding cell adhesion are limited to the availability of instruments such as ﬂuorescence microscopy or ﬂow chambers . These techniques deal with the adhesion of populated cells in response to the chemical or mechanical stimulus . Very few methods can provide a quantitative solution to the measurement of single cell - to - cell adhesion force . In this chapter , we present a new protocol to investigate cell - to - cell adhe - sion force by using AFM - single cell force spectroscopy ( AFM - SCFS ) . In traditional AFM - SCFS , AFM cantilever with di ↵ erent shapes of indenter approaches and then retracts to generate a Force - Displacement curve . Due to the heterogeneity of biolog - ical samples , the approaching part of the curve shows as non - linear because various compartments of the sample are probed , e . g . membrane , organelle and cytosol . The retraction curve shows even irregular as the protein cleavage , adhesion force drop between cantilever and cell may occur constantly . All of these are caused by the diverse mechanical properties of the biological sample . It is very di   cult to system - atically analyse all the mechanical events during one indentation curve . However , our novel cell - to - cell adhesion study has simpliﬁed the analysis procedure , and the whole experiment is easily repeatable . One free - ﬂoating cell is attached the AFM tipless cantilever . Force spectroscopy is performed similarly to AFM - SCFS as it shows approaching and retraction curve . The retraction curve is analysed to pro - vide the energy required to pull two cells apart . This in vitro method provides an insight to quantify cell - to - cell adhesion by using high precision force spectroscopy . 94 6 . 2 Experimental method 6 . 2 . 1 AFM set - up AFM force spectroscopy provides a feasible solution for long pulling length mea - surement . Figure 6 . 1a shows a schematic of AFM head which the key part of AFM force spectroscopy . The AFM head consists of a glass block , three adjustable holding foots , and a locked chamber where contains a laser beam and a photodetector . Prior to any experiment , the cantilever requires being mounted on the glass block with a spring clip . It is suggested that the glass block and cantilever should be sterilised ( with 2 % Hellmanex r solution , 5 - 10 minutes ) and desiccated before mounting . The contact surface between cantilever and glass block should not be connected . It needs to be handled carefully with a tweezer or mounting tools as any dust , scratches or ﬁngerprints will a ↵ ect the measuring accuracy . After the installation of the can - tilever to the glass block , the entire block will be placed upside down into the AFM head . In Figure 6 . 1a , the cantilever shows with 10 ° incline which not only ensures that the laser beam could have angles to reﬂect the photodetector but also prevents the glass block from touching the samples underneath . During the experiment , the transparent glass block allows the lights from the condenser to be transmitted to the inverted camera . Figure 6 . 1b shows the entire set - up of the AFM system . The conﬁguration is assembled Cell - hesion r 200 ( JPK Instrument , Berlin , Germany ) with Eclipse TE 300 inverted microscope ( Nikon , USA ) on an anti - variation table ( TMC 63 - 530 , USA ) . In order to maintain the ideal physiological environment , the cells are placed on a temperature controlling plate ( Bio - Cell ™ , JPK , Berlin , Germany ) . The inverted microscope is ﬁtted with a CCD camera ( DFK 31AF01 Firewire , The Imag - ing Source , Germany ) . All components are controlled and monitored by JPK Cell - hesion r 200 software . The microscope is set between 20 ⇥ to 40 ⇥ magniﬁcation lens 95 ( a ) ( b ) Figure 6 . 1 : ( a ) Schematic of an AFM head which has 100 µ m pulling length to perform cell - to - cell adhesion experiments . The cantilever is mounted on the glass block using a spring clip . 10 - degree incline ensures the laser beam can be transmitted to the photodiode . The glass block is then transferred and mounted in the locked chamber along with the head . The head has three supporting foots which can adjust the level of horizontal . ( b ) Image of AFM head with the microscope . The system is placed on the anti - vibration table . Images are adapted from JPK instrument with permission . 96 and the temperature is set to 37 ￿ . The noise and vibration are well controlled . Room temperature is within 15 ± 0 . 5 ￿ during experiment and all cables are ﬁrmly attached to the ground . Another important function of AFM head before the experiment is to align the laser pathway . As cantilever beam is ﬁtted manually , each installation would have a slight deviation before every experiment . The laser is required to align to the centre of the photodiode . The focused laser beam is irradiated on the back of cantilever and then transmitted to a quadric - sected photodiode . The ﬁrst step is to align the laser beam with the cantilever . It can be observed by CCD camera . The best spot to place the laser dot is at the centre of the triangular head of the cantilever . Secondly , on the software , the laser beam is shown as a red dot on a simulated photodiode . It should be manually adjusted to the centre by using the two screws on the head ( one for horizontal adjustment and the other is for vertical ) . It is suggested that the alignment of laser pathway should be performed in the liquid medium as a small draught may occur compared with the dry surface . When the laser is set to the centre of the photodiode , the maximum sum value is reached and the laser pathway is aligned well . In some experiments , due to the pre - functionalisation of the cantilever , some chemical or biological proteins may leave residues on the cantilever . It is necessary to ﬁnd a clean spot for deﬂection alignment . If there is not red spot shown on the photodiode , the cantilever should be cleaned and redone the process . 6 . 2 . 2 AFM calibration The purpose of calibration is to correlate the small deﬂections of AFM cantilever beam with applied forces . The basic principle is based on Hooke’s law , which the cantilever can be regarded as a ﬂexible beam with a spring constant , k . The force 97 ( F ) is linearly proportional to the deﬂection ( x ) of the cantilever as following : F = kx ( 6 . 1 ) There are two steps to calibrate an AFM cantilever . The initial reading from AFM system is the voltage di ↵ erence which represents the cantilever’s vertical deﬂection on the photodiode . It is necessary to ﬁrstly determine the sensitivity of cantilever from the photodiode detection . Then , cantilever’s deﬂection can be converted to the displacement x ( nm ) . After calibrate the spring constant , the deﬂection will be further converted into force F ( nN ) . As each AFM cantilever has di ↵ erence due to the manufacturing process , it is necessary to calibrate a newly replaced cantilever every time before performing experiments . The sensitivity calibration is to generate a voltage - displacement curve on the system . The cantilever is placed and programmed to indent a sti ↵ surface ( e . g . Petri dish or glass plate ) . With a given displacement , the voltage di ↵ erence can be observed and the linear part is captured to represent the sensitivity of the system . The ideal range for the system sensitivity is approximately 50 - 60 nm Volt   1 . Most AFM cantilever manufacturers have provided a range value of spring constant . It is necessary to calibrate the actual value of spring constant . In the study , commercial AFM provides software to calibrate the spring constant which is using the method called equipartition theorem or thermal noise method described in [ 69 ] . The method is essentially at a given temperature the amplitude of can - tilever ﬂuctuation at speciﬁc direction only depends on the spring constant . Simply speaking , the spring constant ( k ) can be express as [ 69 ] : 98 k = k B T P ( 6 . 2 ) where k B is the Boltzmann’s constant , T is temperature and P is the area of the power spectrum of the thermal ﬂuctuations . 6 . 3 AFM force spectroscopy for cell - to - cell adhesion The traditional purpose of AFM force spectroscopy is to measure the Young’s moduli of the sample . The system generates a Force - Displacement curve which is applied to ﬁt with mechanical models . Further application of AFM force spectroscopy is discovered to investigate the cell - to - cell adhesion force . A suspended / isolated cell attached the cantilever was brought into contact with a cluster of cells on the surface and then retracted it . During the procedure , the system recorded the Force - Displacement curve . Hence , the detachment energy of the cell and substrate cell cluster can be calculated . The very ﬁrst step was to functionalise the tipless cantilever so that the cantilever can attach a cell . The functionalisation was normally performed the day before the experiment . Suitable binding protein should be selected [ 161 ] . In this study , the most widely used adhesion molecules , poly - l - lysine and ﬁbronectin were chosen to coat the cantilever as the protein suits with HK2 cells . Firstly , poly - l - lysine was a polyvalent cation that charges the surface positively so that it can easily grab negatively charged cells and proteins . After sterilisation of the cantilever in UV light for 10 minutes , the cantilever was immersed in the poly - l - lysine ( 25 µ g ml   1 in PBS ) for 30 minutes at room temperature . Secondly , ﬁbronectin was widely used for cell - cell adhesion and matrix assembly [ 5 ] . It was brought as the second layer 99 of coating to contact with the ﬂoating cells’ plasma membrane . The poly - l - lysine treated cantilever was then placed in ﬁbronectin solution ( 20 µ g ml   1 in PBS ) in 37 ￿ for 2 hours . After the entire functionalisation was ﬁnished , the cantilever was stored in 4 ￿ refrigerator in PBS solution overnight . Normally , multiple cantilevers can be functionalised simultaneously and used within 3 days . Secondly , a free suspended cell was required in advanced to the grabbing process . Traditionally , cells were trypsinised to detach from the culturing plates . However , this enzymatic digestion method results in the speciﬁc adhesive protein on the cell membrane was temporarily cleavage . In most cases , these proteins were involved in the cell adhesion process . Hence , a more gentle method was used to detach the cells by using the sterile cell scraper . It was manufactured to impose the minimum damage to the cells . The cells were scraped from the T - 25 / T - 75 culturing ﬂask and suspended in CO 2 - free medium . Then , the free - ﬂoating cells were transported into the Petri dish which con - tains same passage of cells grown underneath . The functionalised cantilever was ﬁrstly calibrated in the dish . An area where no substrate cells reside was picked . By shaking the Petri dish , the ﬂoating cells were manipulated to approach the can - tilever . With the aid of the CCD - linked microscope , the cantilever performs an in - dentation curve against the free ﬂoating cell until a set force ( 1 - 2 nN ) was reached . Then , after 5 seconds holding times on the maximum set force , the unloading curve was then performed , and the free ﬂoating cell was attached to the cantilever . As the cell may be squished or ﬂattened , it should allow 5 - 10 minutes for cells to recover . Figure 6 . 2a shows a cell was attached a functionalised AFM cantilever . An AFM force spectroscopy for cell - to - cell adhesion experiment was per - formed by the cell - attached cantilever and cell cluster . The software was pro - grammed to indent the substrate cells at a speed of 5 µ m sec   1 until the maximum 100 ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) Figure 6 . 2 : ( a ) One single cell attached to the cantilever . ( b ) Schematic of cell - to - cell adhesion assay . ( c ) Typical Force - Displacement curve between two adherent cells . Scale bar , 20 µ m . 101 force ( 1 nN ) was reached . Then two cells remained in contact for 10 seconds . Then cantilever was retracted as a constant speed of 5 µ m sec   1 until the force was re - turned to zero . The procedure was repeated three times with the same cell with 30 seconds intervals for both substrate and cell attached cantilever to recover . Figure 6 . 2b shows the procedure of AFM force spectroscopy applied to measure cell - to - cell adhesion . A Force - Displacement curve was generated as Figure 6 . 2c illustrated . The numbers captioned on the curve represents di ↵ erent phases of contact in Figure 6 . 2b . In phase 1 , the cantilever with a cell was approaching the substrate cell . There was no force existing , and the piezo - actuator remains the constant speed . Then in phase 2 , two cells were brought into contact , and positive forces are generated until maximum force is reached . Phase 3 was the retraction process where two cells were gradually isolated , and some protein unbinding process was taken place until two cells have been fully separated ( i . e . phase 4 ) . Two important pieces of information which have mechanical importance can be further interpreted in this Force - Displacement curve . First is the maximum unbinding force which is the lowest force in phase 3 . Second is the work of adhesion or detachment energy , which is calculated by the grey shaded area in the diagram . 6 . 4 Ketamine reduces functional tethering between cells of the Proximal Tubule ( HK2 ) Ketamine is a tranquilliser that has been widely used as a NMDA receptor antag - onist in the treatment of human bipolar disorders [ 164 ] . However , in 2006 the UK government made Ketamine a class C drug . Possessing mild hallucinogenic proper - ties , Ketamine has rapidly replaced heroin and methamphetamine as the recreational drug of choice [ 163 ] . Cheap to buy and easily accessible , Ketamine has several street 102 names including ‘Special K’ , ‘Vitamin K’ and ‘LA Coke’ . In 2008 , the British Crime Survey revealed that Ketamine was the fastest growing ‘party drug’ among 16 - to 24 - year - old , and it has since been dubbed as the ‘new ecstasy’ [ 113 ] . In the UK , Ke - tamine a ↵ ects an estimated 125 , 000 users , with more young people using Ketamine in England and Wales than heroin and crack cocaine combined . As the number of users increases , serious side e ↵ ects are beginning to emerge . These e ↵ ects , includ - ing bladder shrinkage , ﬁbrosis , incontinence and bleeding , can ultimately lead to complete destruction and subsequent removal of the bladder [ 154 ] . Patients present with multiple symptoms including incontinence , bleeding , over - active bladder and bladder shrinkage , as well as damage to both the kidneys and the ureter [ 143 ] . Despite the growing presentation of these complications , there is an acute lack of understanding of the mechanisms of Ketamine in the pathological responses , and thus there is an urgently need to investigate how this mild hallucinogenic drug scars bladder and renal tissue to impair organ function [ 23 ] . In both the bladder and kidney , early changes in protein expression / function often occur before overt ﬁbrosis . These changes include a loss of epithelial integrity and dysregulated formation of the intercellular junction , involving , loss of epithelial E - cadherin , altered cell morphology , reorganisation of the cytoskeleton and de - novo expression of ﬁbroblastic markers [ 171 ] . Cadherins have a central role in the forma - tion of the multiprotein adherens junction , which links the cell - cell contact to the actin cytoskeleton and various other signalling molecules [ 112 ] . The extracellular domain of the cell adhesion protein E - cadherin mediates ligation with neighbouring cadherins on adjacent cells [ 82 ] , whilst the cytoplasmic domain binds to   - catenin linking cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton via ↵ - catenin . The functional interaction of cadherin with F - actin , via the catenins , not only serves to increase the adhesive strength of the junction but also acts as a signalling node for proteins that inﬂuence adhesiveness and initiate intracellular signalling . The loss of E - cadherin - mediated 103 cell - to - cell adhesion represents a pivotal step in the transition of renal tubule cells from an epithelial phenotype to one more commonly associated with ﬁbrosis [ 62 ] . Down - regulation of E - cadherin precedes changes in cell morphology , reorganisation of cell architecture and the subsequent gain in expression of phenotypic markers associated with renal pathology [ 62 , 63 ] . Ketamine induced a concentration - dependent change in cell morphology to - wards an elongated ﬁbroblast - like phenotype ( Figure 6 . 3a ) . Cells at 80 % conﬂuence were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) . Following blocking , the nuclear stain 49 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole , dihydrochloride ( DAPI ; 1 mM ) was added for 3 min - utes . Cells were then incubated with TRITC - conjugated phalloidin ( Sigma , UK ) diluted at 1 : 100 in PBS - Triton for 1 hour at 25uC . Fluorescence was visualised us - ing an Axiovert 200 ﬂuorescence microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Welwyn Garden City , UK ) . These gross morphological changes were accompanied by re - organisation of the actin cytoskeleton from a di ↵ use transcellular network of F - actin ﬁlaments that spanned the cytosol into more dense peripheral stress ﬁbres ( Figure 6 . 3b ) . Cytosolic proteins were prepared and separated by gel electrophoresis and electro - blotting onto Immobilon P membranes as described in literature [ 61 ] . For determination of protein localisation , proteins were harvested using the Qproteome cell compartment kit . Membranes were probed with speciﬁc polyclonal antibodies against anti - E - cadherin ( 1 : 2000 ) , N - Cadherin ( 1 : 1000 ) , Snail ( 1 : 1000 ) , Slug ( 1 : 1000 ) , ( 1 : 2000 ) , p - Smad 2 ( 1 : 1000 ) , p - Smad 3 ( 1 : 1000 ) ( all R & D systems ) and   - catenin ( 1 : 1000 ) ( Santa Cruz ) . Ketamine induced a concentration - dependent decrease in whole cell expression of E - cadherin by 28 ± 1 % ( P < 0 . 01 ) , 52 ± 12 % ( P < 0 . 001 ) and 76 ± 3 % ( P < 0 . 001 ) as compared to control at 0 . 1 , 0 . 5 and 1 mg ml   1 respectively ( n = 3 , Figure 6 . 3c ) . N - cadherin expression levels decreased in response to Ketamine by to 31 ± 7 % , 47 ± 3 % ( P < 0 . 001 ) and 75 ± 2 % ( P < 0 . 001 ) as compared to control at 0 . 1 , 0 . 5 and 1 mg ml   1 ( n = 3 , see Figure 6 . 3d ) . The 104 ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) ( e ) Figure 6 . 3 : Ketamine evoked cell morphology and cytoskeletal reorganisation in HK2 Cells . HK2 cells were cultured in 5 mM glucose containing media for 48 hours prior to overnight serum starvation . Cells were stimulated for 24 hours with Ketamine ( 0 . 1 - 1 mg ml   1 ) under serum - free conditions and morphological and phenotypic changes assessed . Phase contrast microscopy ( panel ( a ) ) and TRITC conjugated phalloidin ( panel ( b ) ) conﬁrmed the dose dependent e ↵ ects of Ketamine on cell morphology and cytoskeletal reorganisation respectively . Ketamine decreased expression of E - cadherin ( panel ( c ) ) , N - cadherin ( panel ( d ) ) and   - catenin ( panel ( e ) ) . P - value was calculated using One - Way ANOVA with Bonferroni Post - Hoc test . Key signiﬁcances are shown , ⇤ P < 0 . 05 , ⇤⇤ P < 0 . 01 , ⇤⇤⇤ P < 0 . 001 . 105 cytoplasmic domain of E - cadherin binds to   - catenin to link cell adhesion to the actin cytoskeleton Ketamine reduced whole cell expression of   - catenin by 28 ± 6 % , 28 ± 7 % ( P < 0 . 05 ) and 39 ± 2 % ( P < 0 . 01 ) as compared to control at 0 . 1 , 0 . 5 and 1 mg ml   1 ( n = 3 , Figure 6 . 3e ) . In the renal tubule , epithelial function depends on complex cell - to - cell in - teractions mediated through the adherens junction . In the current study , we pre - sented data outlining early toxicological e ↵ ects of Ketamine on proteins critical to the formation of the adherens junction complex in the kidney . Utilising the high - resolution AFM - SCFS , we assessed the functional consequence of cell - cell tethering in Ketamine - treated cells which exhibited a loss of cadherin expression . Our data provides compelling evidence that Ketamine reduces cell - to - cell adhesion in epithe - lial cells of the proximal tubule . Translated to the in vivo scenario , the subsequent loss of epithelial integrity , structure and function may contribute to the toxicological and potential ﬁbrotic response to Ketamine in the kidney . AFM - SCFS was used to measure cell - to - cell adhesion and the separation forces and energies required to uncouple cells ( detailed introduced in Chapter 6 . 3 ) . Prior to attachment , cells were cultured for 48 hours under identical conditions with / without Ketamine ( 0 . 1 - 1 mg ml   1 ) . A single HK2 cell was bound to a can - tilever and subsequently brought into contact with an adherent cell within a cluster , using a ﬁxed force . After 10 seconds , the cantilever was retracted ( 5 µ m sec   1 ) and force versus displacement measured until the cells were completely separated . Retraction Force - Displacement curves provide important information regarding the adhesion between two cells , i . e . the energy required to separate them ( the grey area in Figure 6 . 4a - 6 . 4d ) as well as maximum force of detachment ( the red circle in Figure 6 . 4a - 6 . 4d ) . The energy required to separate two cells is normally referred as ‘detachment 106 energy’ ( Figure 6 . 4e ) whilst the maximum force of detachment for complete sepa - ration is deﬁned as the ‘maximum unbinding force’ ( Figure 6 . 4f ) . The retraction measurements of control versus Ketamine ( 0 . 1 - 1 mg ml   1 ) - treated cells are shown in Figure 6 . 4e and 6 . 4f . In each case , data is recorded from multiple cells ( > 10 ) in 4 separate experiments at each concentration . Compared to control , Ketamine evokes a concentration - dependent decrease in the maximum unbinding force by 33 ± 6 % , 41 ± 3 % , and 58 ± 6 % at 0 . 1 mg ml   1 , 0 . 5 mg ml   1 and 1 mg ml   1 recep - tively ( P < 0 . 001 ) , whilst the detachment energy decreased by 32 ± 8 % , 63 ± 7 % , and 86 ± 11 % of control at 0 . 1 mg ml   1 , 0 . 5 mg ml   1 and 1 mg ml   1 receptively ( P < 0 . 001 ) . 6 . 5 Summary In epithelial cells of the proximal tubule , disease - induced ﬁbrosis commonly presents with cell atrophy , increased matrix deposition and tubulointerstitial scarring , all of which culminate in a loss of renal function [ 43 , 81 , 138 ] . The reciprocal loss of tubular epithelial cells and accumulation of interstitial ﬁbroblasts promotes chronic ﬁbrosis . Characteristic changes include morphological and phenotype alterations with the cytoskeletal reorganisation and the down - regulation of epithelial cell adhe - sion molecules , such as E - cadherin . The integrity of the adherens junction is vital to maintaining basic epithelial function , and the loss of E - cadherin - mediated cell adhesion represents a pivotal step in early phenotypic and morphological changes observed in tubular injury [ 43 , 108 ] . AFM - SCFS has been successfully applied to determine how a loss in adherens junction proteins functionally a ↵ ected cell - to - cell adhesion . The AFM - single - cell force spectroscopy used in this study has a displacement actuator of longer trav - elling distance ( up to 100 µ m ) which provides an excellent capability for measur - 107 ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) ( e ) ( f ) Figure 6 . 4 : Ketamine reduces cell adhesion . AFM - cell - to - cell force spectroscopy was used to measure the detachment energy ( fJoules ) and maximum unbinding force ( nN ) required to uncouple two HK2 cells . The calculation of energy required to separate the cells was to integrate grey area in panel ( a ) control cells , panel ( b ) ( 0 . 1 mg ml   1 Ketamine treated cells ) , panel ( c ) ( 0 . 5 mg ml   1 Ketamine treated cells ) , panel ( d ) ( 1 mg ml   1 Ketamine treated cells ) by JPK software , and maximum force of detachment ( red circle ) was measured . The former is known as the ‘detachment energy’ ( panel ( e ) ) and later is ‘maximum unbinding force’ ( panel ( f ) ) . Ketamine decreased the maximum unbinding force and the work of adhesion in a dose depen - dent manner compared to control . Data is expressed as mean ± s . e . m of multiple cells from 4 separate experiments , where key signiﬁcances are shown , ⇤⇤⇤ P < 0 . 001 , ⇤⇤ P < 0 . 01 . 108 ing the complete Force - Displacement curve of cell detachment and is essential for studying large cells such as those as found in renal tubule epithelia . Retraction Force - Displacement curves allow determining the force and energy required to un - couple cells . The former is normally referred to as ‘adhesion force’ and the latter the ‘detachment energy’ , which can be calculated from the integration of the separation Force - Displacement curves , i . e . the grey area under the curve in Figure 6 . 4a - 6 . 4d . Retraction Force - Displacement curves conﬁrmed that 1 mg ml   1 Ketamine reduced the maximum unbinding force required to begin separate them by 86 % . The greater decrease in the detachment energy could be partly explained due to the increase in cell rigidity following Ketamine treatment , as demonstrated by rearrangement of the cytoskeleton into peripheral stress ﬁbres . These data suggest that it is the loss of E - cadherin expression and dissolution of the catenin / cadherin complex , which drives the detachment of cells in response to Ketamine . 109 Chapter 7 Synopsis and future work Cellular contraction force and cell - to - cell adhesion force can be accurately measured using a novel biomechanical tester and AFM - SCFS , respectively . The measurement procedures and system set - up along with the development of mathematical models have been described in the thesis . This chapter concludes the remarks of this project and lists the advantages and limitations of the techniques for future recommenda - tions . 7 . 1 Research highlight The depth - sensing indentation device which is originally designed to investigate the mechanical properties of soft biological samples has been successfully applied to measure the contraction force of ﬁbroblast . A non - linear strain dependent elasticity model combined with the indentation testing results has been successfully applied to evaluate Young’s moduli of the collagen matrix . Furthermore , cell contraction force is estimated in a three - dimensional collagen gel matrix at high accuracy . Due to the features of measurement procedure which allows for the elasticity of collagen matrix 110 to be examined precisely , collagen matrix e ↵ ects on inﬂuencing cell contraction force have been discovered . The adhesive properties of soft biological cells ( HK2 ) under the speciﬁc bio - chemical treatment have also been investigated quantitatively by using AFM - SCFS . The various states of cell - to - cell adhesion process have been demonstrated . The loss of E - cadherin expression caused by the mild hallucinogenic drug Ketamine has been presented . After the AFM - SCFS validation by a novel cell - to - cell adhesion experiment , a loss of adhesive energy induced by Ketamine is also clearly proved and stated . The results further conﬁrmed that the cell - to - cell adhesion process is mediated by the interactions of E - cadherin and cytoskeleton at adherent junctions . In the view of cell biomechanics , the cell entity and its micro - environment seek to establish a stable structure and functions . Contraction and adhesion forces are vital in many biological processes ( introduced in Chapter 1 ) . From a sub - cellular point of view , cells regulate themselves via signalling channels and cytoskeleton network which directs and adjusts motions . In the scale of cellular matrix level , cells are capable of mechano - sensing , translating and adapting to the mechanically or chemically stimulated micro - environment . The cell continuously converts the outside energy and responds to the external environment by changing its structure and forces . For example , cell adhesion forces are endlessly changing directed by the focal adhesion signalling channels during each state of migration . Cell migration requires contraction forces intermittently so that cell can move forward . Therefore , accurate determination of mechanical forces plays a critical role in understanding many biophysical and biochemical process . Mechanical force generated by the cells can be regarded as a biomarker or diagnosis signal because it has signiﬁcance in distinguishing treated and non - treated cells . The common understanding of a cell’s phenotype is presented by the expression 111 of protein , morphology and cellular behaviour . However , physical forces can be regarded as an important parameter of a cell’s characteristics . Under the controlled environment , systematically altering the protein expression , such as E - cadherin or actin - myosin cross - bridge , causes the cell to generate di ↵ erent amounts of forces . Subsequently , gene expression and force generation should be closely monitored especially in the cellular motional behaviours . 7 . 2 System limitations The novel biomechanical tester has its advantage in the determination of Young’s modulus of biomaterials , such as the hydrogel [ 78 ] . It provides an economic , feasible and quick solution to in vitro mechanical examination of samples . The contact time and approaching / retraction speed are easily and well controlled . The resolution is suitable for testing biomaterials such as collagen gel . However , it has limitations in its application for single cell mechanics because the tip of the indenter is not easily modiﬁed and fabricated . The system is also not easily replicable as each component is from di ↵ erent manufacturers and the assembly of the system requires great e ↵ ort in development and programming . Although AFM - SCFS has provided a new solution to measure cell - to - cell ad - hesion , it still has its limitation , e . g . it is time - consuming in measurements . Each functionalised cantilever can be only used for attaching one or two free - ﬂoating cell . In addition , many unexpected scenarios may occur in the process of cantilever grabbing a free - ﬂoating cell . For example , unwanted adherent particles may clutter in - between the cantilever and attached cell which can be observed under the mi - croscopy . Alternatively , the attaching point of free cell and cantilever is not ideal as in many cases the cell is not fully inside the cantilever coverage . 112 All these unexpected attachment results in changing a new cantilever and restarting the attaching process . Cells gradually lose their viability and more un - wanted secretions may be generated by the cells during the preparation . Any move - ment of the machine or change of condition would have led to the loss of cell adhesion . Both techniques share the same limitation of testing samples in vitro . Al - though the system has a temperature compensation system , the CO 2 condition is di ↵ erent from the real physiological conditions . The solution to mitigate the lim - itation is to keep the untested samples in the incubator and to test the prepared sample in a stable and sterile environment during a limited experimental time , which is normally less than 2 hours . 7 . 3 Possible applications and recommendations The biomechanical tester is designed in combination with the advanced ﬂuorescence microscope and CCD camera . The future application of the device can be used to examine the mechanotransduction of cells . The addition of chemical or mechanical signals would activate intracellular signalling cascade which would ultimately change the cell behaviours . The device can be used as mechanical input to the cells , for example , a constant or intermittent pressure to mimic blood vessel compression or to generate force onto osteoblast to stimulate cell growth . The biomechanical testing results can be used as a biomarker for diagnosis of disease . A comprehensive examination is needed in a more well - controlled envi - ronment . Biochemical factors should be examined separately by using western blot or microarray analysis for example . This will contribute to the advancement in the design of biomaterial and diagnostics . The collagen gel - based contraction examination can be further improved by 113 applying a more sophisticated mathematical model which is not limited to the static one . For example , the time lapse video can be used to record the entire gel contrac - tion process . Some micro - beads can be used as a marker to track the gel contraction in a 3D way . Optical coherent tomography can also be used as an imaging tool to enhance the accuracy of testing by scanning the collagen gel matrix continually . Growth factor - induced contraction event can be further analysed by the current technique . In addition to the modiﬁcation in the cell contraction assay , cell - to - cell adhe - sion assay also needs further improvement . Due to the accuracy of AFM - SCFS , focal adhesion e ↵ ect can be examined thoroughly at a di ↵ erent stage of cell locomotion . Quantifying the distribution of mechanical force between di ↵ erent sub - cellular com - ponents , such as protein - protein and cell - protein , could be the next advancement in cellular biophysics . 114 Appendix A This appendix contains a list of publications from the author related with this thesis , supplemental ﬁgures and tables that supporting the context . 115 Biomed .

Introduction The culture of cells within 3D matrices has been used forseveraldecades [ 1 ] . Thebehavioursofcellsintissue - like matrices , such as migration , contraction and proliferation , exhibit an ideal model of their in vivo phenotype . Several materials have been developed for the synthesis of cellular encapsulated hydrogels . Col - lagen , alginate , ﬁ brin and agarose are extensively used as the natural polymer ingredients to construct engi - neeredtissueequivalents [ 2 ] . Amongthese , collagenhas been recognised as one of the major components in connective tissues , which forms stable ﬁ brils and provides multiple cellular binding sites [ 3 , 4 ] . Fibro - blasts are the main cell type that in ﬂ uence remodelling and biosynthesisofcollagen ﬁ brils [ 1 ] . Asthestructure of collagen provides a mechanically stable framework , the contractile properties of ﬁ broblasts seeded within a collagenmatrixprovidesagoodmodelforinvestigating tissuephysiologyandpathology . Currently , one of the most prevailing techniques to obtain cellularised collagen gels is modi ﬁ ed from the method of Bell et al [ 5 ] . Measuring the contraction of cells embedded in 3D matrices is relatively straight for - ward using the conventional collagen gel contraction assay . When cells start to contract , the collagen matrix normally exhibits a noticeable reduction in size . How - ever , previous studies using collagen gel - based assays to measure ﬁ broblast contractility were limited to only examiningthechangesinoverallgelradiusandhencean accuratedeterminationofcellcontractionforcewasdif - ﬁ cult to achieve .

Thereforeevenasamedegreeofgelradiusshrinkage doesnotprovideanaccuraterepresentationofthesamemagnitudeofcontractionforce , because the quantity of matrixstiffnessneedstobeconsideredinthedetermina - tion of cellular contraction forces [ 6 ] . To date , there are very few reports demonstrating that the stiffness of col - lagenmatricescanin ﬂ uencecellularcontractionforces . At the site of vascular diseases such as athero - sclerosis , arterial injury leads to enhanced adventitial ﬁ broblast contraction and changes in the extra cellular matrix ( ECM ) contributing to vessel remodelling and restenosis [ 7 ] . Collagen ﬁ brils form a tightly aligned structure due to the synthesis of connective tissues fol - lowing vessel injury and in ﬂ ammation . Fibroblasts can produce a large amount of collagen protein to increase theoveralltissuetensilestrengththatcontributestovas - cularstiffeningandimpairedfunction [ 8 ] . Thepresence of differentiated contractile myo ﬁ broblast has been associated with the increase of ECM stiffness and they mediatetheproductionofforceforwoundcontraction [ 9 ] . The interaction between ﬁ broblasts and various ECM components has been investigated using a num - ber of engineering tools . These methods include cell populated micropillar substrates [ 10 ] or traction force microscopy [ 11 , 12 ] .

Materialsandmethod Con ﬂ uent cultures of human aortic adventitial ﬁ bro - blasts ( HAoAF , PromoCell , Germany ) were detached from ﬂ asks using trypsin / EDTA and cells were re - suspended in Dulbecco ’ s modi ﬁ ed Eagle ’ s medium ( DMEM ) containing 5 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) . Cells were then mixed with culture medium containing collagen I on ice , to achieve a ﬁ nal density of 2 . 16 × 10 5 cells gel − 1 in DMEM containing 2 mM L - glutamine , 100 IU ml − 1 penicillin , 100 μ g ml − 1 streptomycin , 5 % FCS and different collagen concen - trations of 1 . 5 , 2 . 0 and 2 . 5 mg ml − 1 . The collagen matrix cell suspension was transferred into 35 mm Petridishes ( 1 . 2mldish − 1 ) and incubated in aculture incubator ( 37 ° C , 5 % CO 2 ) for 20 min to allow gel polymerisation before addition of a further 1 . 5 ml DMEM containing 5 % FCS . After incubation over - night , the culture medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 5 % FCS . Some dishes were then stimulated with the agonist histamine ( 100 μ M ) to elicit cell contraction . Collagen gels were then imme - diately dislodged from the dish using a sterile spatula with gel thickness and elasticity measurements con - ducted5hlater . Histamine was employed in this study to elicit HAoAF contraction as it has been wellcharacterised to actviaG - proteincoupledreceptors . Uponactivation , it Figure1 .

The thickness and radius of collagen gel were measured at the beginning and end of treatment to determine the overall ﬁ broblast contraction force ( see equation ( 2 ) ) . Ten random positions were measured to calculate average gel thickness ( shown in ﬁ gure 2 ( C ) ) . The depth sensing indentation device was used to measure displacement difference from the gel top surface to the Petri dish surface . The top view images of the disc - shaped collagen were captured and used to measure the gel radius before and after shrinkage by referencing the culture surface within the Petri dishes ( illustrated as ﬁ gure2 ( B ) ) . Figure 3 ( A ) shows the results derived from mea - surement of Young ’ s moduli of both the treated and untreated gels , demonstrating a dose - dependent increase with collagen concentrations . Interestingly , histamine treatment slightly reduces the Young ’ s modulus of collagen gel compared with the untreated gels at the same collagen concentration . Figure 3 ( B ) shows the overall contraction force of ﬁ broblasts which was calculated based on the equation ( 2 ) using the measured geometric parameters and Young ’ s modulus of the gel . The result shows the contraction forcedecreaseasthecollagenconcentrationincreases . It was evident that histamine treatments doubled overall contraction cell force in every concentration group . Figure 3 ( C ) demonstrates that cell contraction forcedecreasesmonotonicallyasthegelconcentrationincreases . Histamine treated gels exhibited a sig - ni ﬁ cantlinearregressionmodelintheoverallcontrac - tionforceagainstcollagenconcentration ( P = 0 . 0002 ) comparedwithuntreatedcells ( P = 0 . 16 ) . 4 . Discussion In this study , adventitial ﬁ broblast contraction forces were measured based on cell - populated collagen gels to investigate the effect of gel stiffness on overall contraction force generated by the ﬁ broblasts . The Young ’ s modulus ( or stiffness ) of collagen gel , as calculatedbythenonlinearstraindependentmechan - ical model [ 18 , 19 ] , demonstrates a clear increase as the gel collagen concentration increases . The increase in the gel Young ’ s modulus regulated ﬁ broblast contraction force as the cell contractility was signi ﬁ - cantly reduced in the stiffer matrices . Moreover , the addition of the agonist histamine elicited signi ﬁ cant ﬁ broblast contraction forces . In all collagen concen - trationgroups , thehistaminetreated ﬁ broblastsexhib - ited a two - fold increase in their contraction forces ( ﬁ gure 3 ( B ) ) despite the decrease in Young ’ s modulus of the collagen gels ( ﬁ gure 3 ( A ) ) . This proves the Young ’ smodulusofgelmatricesshouldbeconsidered as a key parameter to properly assess cellular contrac - tionforcesusinggel - basedassays . The results clearly demonstrate that the mechan - ical properties of collagen matrices in ﬂ uence the contractile responses of ﬁ broblasts . Cells in stiffer ( higher Young ’ s modulus ) materials exhibit a sig - ni ﬁ cant reduction in their contractility measured by our novel method , which is comparable to the results obtained by using other techniques , such as CFM [ 20 ] . Forhistamine - inducedcellcontractionassay , we showedamoresigni ﬁ cantdecreaseofoverallcontrac - tion force as the matrix stiffness increases . With the activation of MLC phosphorylation mediated by the agonist histamine , cell contractility increases , how - ever , ﬁ broblast contraction force will also be affected by the interaction between the cells and the collagen matrix .

In the blood vessel wall , in ﬂ ammatory disease processes would increase ECM collagen content thereby causing vas - cular dysfunction due to enhanced stiffness which impactsonthecontractilityofresident ﬁ broblasts . In the earlier reports , a loss of mass has been shown in ﬁ broblast collagen gel assays during cell contraction process [ 5 ] . This ﬁ nding also implies that there were a potential loss in cell numbers in the collagen - gel - based contraction assay for long - term ( > 48 h ) measurements . Hence , a certain degree of inaccuracy is likely in the determination of ﬁ broblast contraction force using previous techniques ( e . g . cul - ture force monitor ( CFM ) [ 21 , 22 ] ) , because the mass and cell loss may cause alterations in the mechanical properties of the collagen matrix . How - ever , since the treatment time in our current study is only 5 h , there was likely to be no signi ﬁ cant loss of cellsorgelmass . 5 . Conclusion We have demonstrated that in a 3D collagen matrix , thecellsexhibitdifferentlevelsofcontractilitydepend - ing on the collagen concentration and gel stiffness . The ﬁ nding con ﬁ rms that the mechanical properties of the collagen matrix should be considered in the cellular contraction events induced by physiological changes ( e . g . effect of agonist treatments ) . Different cell types may have varying degrees of response depending on the mechanism of their sensing of the substrate stiffness . Overall , the study has shown the importance of matrix stiffness on cell contraction forces in the design of collagen - based biomaterials for clinicalapplications .

This study describes a novel method to quantify single cell contraction force in vitro using human aortic adventitial fibroblastsembeddedinacollagen gel . The technique isbased ona depth sen - singnano - indentationtestertomeasurethethicknessandelasticityofcollagen gels containing stimulated fibroblasts and a microscopy imaging system to estimate the gel area . In parallel , a simple theoretical model has been devel - oped to calculate cell contraction force based on the measured parameters . Histamine ( 100 m M ) was used to stimulate fibroblast contraction while the myosin light chain kinase inhibitor ML - 7 ( 25 m M ) was used to inhibit cell con - traction . The collagen matrix used in the model provides a physiological environment for fibroblast contraction studies . Measurement of changes in collagen gel elasticity and thickness arising from histamine treatments provides a novel convenient technique to measure cell contraction force within a collagen matrix . This study demonstrates that histamine can elicit a significant increase in contraction force of fibroblasts embedded in collagen , while the Young’s modulus of the gel decreases due to the gel degradation . 1 . Introduction The collagen contraction assay was firstly reported by Bell et al . [ 1 ] and has been described as fibroblast - populated collagen lattice ( FPCL ) . The mechanism for fibroblast contraction is mediated by the control of myosin light chain ( MLC ) phosphorylation status through the action of MLC kinase ( MLCK ) [ 2 ] . As reviewed by Dallon & Ehrlich [ 3 ] , raised intracellular calcium levels leads to calmodulin - dependentMLCKactivation , whichresultsinMLCphosphorylation and actin – myosin crossbridge formation and filament sliding . Humanaortic adventitial fibroblasts ( HAoAF ) are residentinthe adventitiaof theaortaandtheyhavebeenemployedinexperimentalmodelsofarterialremodel - lingandrestenosis [ 4 ] . Histamine isan agonist that elicits increases in intracellular calciumandisreleasedbybasophilsandmastcellsduringinflammatoryresponses . It acts on cells via a family of G protein - coupled histamine receptors , histamine receptor H1 – H4 . Several studies have shown that human fibroblasts express H1 receptor and can be activated via histamine binding , resulting in phospholipase C activation and production of inositol triphosphates ( IP 3 ) and diaglycerol ( DAG ) [ 5 , 6 ] . The increase of IP 3 causes calcium release from the internal stores and consequently triggers fibroblast contraction via activation of MLCK [ 7 ] . Several approaches have been developed to measure cell contraction forces in vitro ; among these , collagen gel contraction assay ( CGCA ) and traction force microscopy ( TFM ) are the most common techniques . For the both methods , cell contraction forces are measured indirectly based on measurement of defor - mation of the matrix surrounding the cells , such as a cell - embedded collagen gel or cell - seeded polymer substrate . However , the CGCA technique is used for the measurement of forces in populations of cells , while TFM is more suited for the measurement of forces in single cells . & 2015 The Author ( s ) Published by the Royal Society . All rights reserved . 121 When CGCA is used for assessing contraction forces , cells are embedded within the collagen matrix , which provides cells withaphysiologicalenvironment . Collagenisakeycomponent oftheextracellularmatrixthatfacilitatescellmigrationandcon - traction [ 8 ] . Cell - embedded collagen gels are easily constructed and the measurement of their contraction is straightforward . Conventional techniques used to measure collagen gel contrac - tion rely on imaging only the gel area from a top view . The estimationofcontraction isoften expressedbytheareachanges of the gels between the beginning and end of the treatment or cell contraction period [ 9 , 10 ] . To improve the measurement of cell contraction kinetics for time - dependent changes , time - lapse - video - based imaging techniques have been developed to recordchangesingelareascontinuouslywhilethecellscontract [ 11 ] . Although the versatility of the CGCA method facilitates generaluse , itdoesnotprovidequantificationofcellularcontrac - tion forces , since the mechanical properties of the collagen matrix will dictate the measurement accuracy of the cellular contraction forces . The elasticity of the disc - shaped collagen gel can be influenced by the cell treatments and the same amount of gel radius shrinkage may result from very different cellular contraction forces . Moreover , in the normal physio - logical environment , cells do not merely contract in a two - dimensional manner , therefore , measuring the radius of thegel disc onlyfromthetopviewwillnotprovidean accurate assessment of the magnitude of cellularcontraction . Alternatively , TFM was developed to measure single cell contraction forces by observing the underlying elastic polymer substrate ( e . g . polyacrylamide gel ) embedded with multiple fluorescence microbeads [ 12 – 14 ] . A number of mathematical models have been developed to facilitate the estimation of contraction force based on the relative motion of the beads . However , the stiffness of the gel substrate can be altered by cell differentiation and biochemical treatments during the measurement and this may affect the accuracy of the force measurement . More importantly , it is more technically challen - gingtoobtainresultsusingtheTFMmethodandmeasurements do not provide a true physiological model because the assess - ment of cellular contraction based on a two - dimensional surface , instead of a three - dimensional gel matrix . To improve the accuracy of CGCA force measurements , a culture force monitor ( CFM ) system was developed byattach - ing strain gauges at the edges of acell - embedded collagen gel to directlyassess cell contraction [ 15 – 20 ] . Cellular contraction force can be measured continuously without influence of the elastic variation of collagen gel . Single cell contraction force can thus be approximately estimated by the measu - red force divided by the total number of the embedded cells . However , the measurement was only limited to a random uniaxial stress as the strain gauges could only measure the contraction in single directions . Having taken into account the variation in elasticity of the collagen matrix , we re - designed the collagen gel - based assay technique to quantify cell contraction forces with a signifi - cantly higher degree of accuracy . The method essentially correlates the relationship between gel deformation and embedded cell contraction force . The elastic modulus and thickness of each collagen gel were routinely quantified by a bespoke nano - indentation tester and the data were used as input parameters for a simple mathematical model that correlates cell contraction force with gel properties , including radius , thickness and elasticity , which varied throughout the differenttreatments . Thesinglecellcontractionforcecanalsobe determined providing that the total cell number embedded in the gels are known . In this study , we have also applied the new gel - based sensing techniqueto investigate the contraction forceofHAoAFtreatedwiththeagonisthistamineorfollowing co - treatmentwithML - 7 , awell - establishedinhibitorofMLCK , to attenuate fibroblast contraction . 2 .

The cell suspension was transferred into 35mm Petri dishes ( 1 . 2mldish 2 1 , achieving cell densities between 0 . 06 ! 10 6 and 0 . 3 ! 10 6 cellsgel 2 1 ) and incubated in a cell culture incubator for 20min to polymerize the gel before additionofafurther1 . 5mlDMEMcontaining5 % FCS .

Gel thickness and elasticity measurements were conducted 48h later . In experiments to address the effects of histamine on cell contraction , fibroblasts were re - suspended in DMEM containing 10 % FCS at a density of 1 . 8 ! 10 6 cellsml 2 1 ( achieving a cell density of 0 . 216 ! 10 6 cells gel 2 1 ) andincubatedfor16hbeforetreatmentofcellsinthepresence or absence of the MLCK inhibitor ML - 7 ( 25 m M ) for 30min . Some dishes were then stimulated with the agonist histamine ( 100 m M ) to elicit cell contraction . Collagen gels were then immediately dis - lodged from the dish using a sterile spatula with gel thickness and elasticity measurements conducted 5h later . 2 . 2 . 2 . Experimental measurements A depth - sensing nano - indentation tester was developed to quan - titativelymeasure the thickness and Young’s modulus of the cell - embedded collagen gel , which were used as input parameters to estimate contraction force ( § 2 . 3 . 2 ) . As shown in the figure 1 , the system is mainly comprised of a force transducer ( 406A , Aurora Scientific Inc . ) attached with a cylindrical flat punch or indenter ( ca 1 mmindiameter ) , Z - axisstepmotorlinearstage ( UTS100CC with ESP301 Motion Controller , Newport ) , XY - axis stage ( ProScan III , Prior Scientific ) and a temperature control heating plate ( Temp . Control , iBidi ) . All components are mounted on an inverted microscope ( TE2000 - S , Nikon ) and controlled by Labview software ( National Instrument ) . The system has ulti - mate force and displacement resolutions of 10 nN and 100 nm , respectively . The force transducer senses the force via the cylind - rical indenter . The mechanical properties of collagen gels were measured by the system described . Nano - indentation of collagen gel was performed at a controlled indentation speed of 40 m m s 2 1 . Force and displacement were recorded simul - taneously during the loading / unloading indentation cycles . r s i f . r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g J . R . S o c . I n t e r f a c e 12 : 20141365 2 122 When the thickness and elasticity were measured , collagen gel was plated in the 35 mm Petri dishes with no culturing medium on the heating plate at 37 8 C . The whole system was placed on an anti - vibration table ( Wentworth Laboratories Ltd ) . Ten random positions were picked and measured to generate 10 different force – displacement ( F – D ) curves for analysis . The thickness of the gel was measured based on the displacement difference between the gel’s top surface and the Petri dish sur - face , while the gel’s elasticity was measured based on the analysis of the indentation F – D curves ( § 2 . 3 . 1 ) . In parallel , a computerized CCD - enhanced camera ( ORCA - ER , Hamamatsu ) has been used to measure the radius of the disc - shaped hydrogel , from the vertical top view , and the radius change before and after cell contraction can be determined by referencing the culturing area of the Petri dishes . The measurement accuracy of the radius was up to 1 m m . 2 . 3 . Theoretical analysis 2 . 3 . 1 . Young’s modulus of collagen gel Young’s modulus of collagen gel is modelled by employing nonlinear strain - dependent elasticity [ 21 ] : E ¼ E 0 1 # ! e þ ( ! e 2 = 3 ) ( 1 # ! e ) 2 : ( 2 : 1 ) where E 0 is Young’s modulus at strain ! e ¼ 0 . To estimate Young’s modulus , it is necessary to find a suitable connection between the F – D curveandthemodulus . Whenacylindricalpunchindentinga flat elastic substrate ( collagen gel ) , a linear relationship derived from Hertz contact theory can be expressed as [ 22 ] : E % ¼ F 2 rD , ( 2 : 2 ) where E * isthereducedmodulusofcollagengel , r istheradiusof the cylindricalindenter , D isthe displacementor depth of the indenter into the collagen gel surface and F is the force measured by the forcetransducer . Fortwoelasticbodiesincontact , thereducedmod - ulus can be also described as follows according to Hertz contact theory [ 23 ] : E % ¼ 1 # y 2 E þ 1 # y 2 i E i ! " # 1 , ( 2 : 3 ) where n is the Poisson’s ratio and E is Young’s modulus of the indented collagen gel . The subscript i refers to the properties of the cylindrical indenter . Hydrogel can normally be considered as an incompressible material , i . e . n ¼ 1 / 2 , and the indenter is regarded as perfectly rigid , i . e . E i ¼ 1 , and thus equation ( 2 . 3 ) can be simplified as follows : E % ¼ 4 E 3 : ( 2 : 4 ) z - axis stage ( a ) ( b ) force transducer collagen gel sample on heating plate x – y axis stage microscope and CCD camera arm monitor and controlling unit Figure 1 .

I n t e r f a c e 12 : 20141365 3 123 Combining ( 2 . 1 ) , ( 2 . 2 ) and ( 2 . 4 ) , the following equation can be derived : F ( ! e ) ¼ E 0 & 8 rD 3 & ! e # ! e 2 þ ( ! e 3 = 3 ) ( 1 # ! e ) 2 : ( 2 : 5 ) For the strain ! e can be approximatelycalculated asthe ratio of the displacement of the indenter to the measured thickness of the col - lagen gel , H , i . e . ! e ¼ D = H . Hence , by using nonlinear least square regression to fit F ( ! e ) with D based on equation ( 2 . 5 ) , Young’s modulus E 0 of the collagen gel can be estimated from each measured F – D curve . 2 . 3 . 2 . Contraction force A simple theoretical model has been developed to estimate cell contraction force based on the force balance between cell contraction and gel deformation . Figure 2 shows the thickness ( h 0 and h 1 ) and radius ( r 0 and r 1 ) of a disc - shape collagen gel at the beginning and end of contraction . Young’s modulus E 0 of the collagen gel is described by the linear elastic mechanics as : E 0 ¼ d s d 1 , ( 2 : 6 ) where d s and d 1 represent stress and strain , respectively , gener - ated by cell contraction to the gel . During the entire contraction process , the contraction force acts perpendicularly on the circum - ference surface which area can be expressed as 2 p r . h . Hence the stress d s can be calculated by radial contraction force d F per unit area as the equation : d s ¼ d F 2 p r & h , ( 2 : 7 ) where r and h are the immediate radius and thickness of collagen gel . Correspondingly , the strain d 1 can be expressed as the deformation of collagen gel in the radial direction . d 1 ¼ d r r : ( 2 : 8 ) Hence , combingequations ( 2 . 6 ) , ( 2 . 7 ) and ( 2 . 8 ) , Young’s modulus E 0 can be expressed as : E 0 ¼ d s d 1 ¼ d F 2 p h & d r : ( 2 : 9 ) Here , the average thickness can be expressed as h ¼ ( h 0 þ h 1 ) / 2 if the gel thickness change is approximately linear during the contraction process . After rearranging equation ( 2 . 9 ) with inte - gration , the final overall contraction force therefore can be presented as : F ¼ ð r 0 r 1 d F ¼ ð r 0 r 1 p E 0 ( h 0 þ h 1 ) d r ¼ p E 0 ( h 0 þ h 1 ) ( r 0 # r 1 ) : ( 2 : 10 ) The model simply correlates the overall cell contraction force F with the measured material parameters , including Young’s mod - ulus , thickness and radius of collagen gel . The single cell contraction force is approximately calculated as the overall contraction force divided by the counted cell numbers . 3 . Result 3 . 1 . Young’s modulus of collagen gel Typical indentation curves and theircorresponding nonlinear fitting curves are represented in figure 3 a . The first 25 % of the indentation depth to the gel thickness ( i . e . strain up to 0 . 25 ) is selectedtoestimateYoung’smodulusofthecollagenbasedon the minimum least square fitting of equation ( 2 . 5 ) with the experimental force – strain data . Figure 3 b shows Young’s modulus for HAoAF - embedded collagen gels for controlled gels and treated gels at a cell density of 0 . 216 ! 10 6 cells gel 2 1 . After treatment with histamine , Young’s modulus of the col - lagen gels was decreased by 41 . 2 % compared with the untreatedgels , whiletreatmentwithML - 7showstheinhibitory effect of decreasing elasticity ( ca 59 . 3 % ) . 3 . 2 . HAoAF contraction force after histamine and ML - 7 treatment The images shown in figure 4 b , c demonstrate the shrinkage of the HAoAF - embedded collagen gels treated by histamine with / without ML - 7 compared with the untreated gel ( figure 4 a ) . The shaken gel sizes / radii can be calculated by counting the pixels of the gel images referencing the culturing area of the Petri dishes . By substituting the measured radius , Young’s modulus and thickness of collagen gels into equation ( 2 . 10 ) , HAoAF contraction force can then be esti - mated . Figure 5 shows that when cells were treated with histamine ( 100 m M ) , there was a nearly threefold increase in contraction force from 0 . 3 + 0 . 04 to 0 . 89 + 0 . 02 mN of over - all contraction force . In the meantime , the contraction forces of single cells were calculated by the overall contraction force divided with the total number of cells embedded in the collagen gel . The single cell contraction force correspond - ingly increased from 1 . 41 + 0 . 4 nN to 4 . 15 + 0 . 5 nN when histamine was added . The MLCK inhibitor ML - 7 ( 25 m M ) attenuated the increase in contraction force by 60 % . 3 . 3 . Cell - density effect on contraction force In the study , a constant volume of collagen gel was embedded with different cell densities to examine whether cell density could potentially have an influence on single cell contraction force . As shown in figure 6 , the gel r 0 h 0 h 1 d F d r d F h r 1 r Figure 2 .

The result showsthat the overall contrac - tion force calculated as determined by linear regression increases in a linear manner with the seeding densities of fibroblasts . As a result , the cell densities within the gels can be assumed to have no significant influence on the single cell contraction force measurements . 4 . Discussion Thisstudydescribesanovelmethodtoassesscellularcontrac - tionforce invitro usingacollagengel - basedsensingtechnique to demonstrate cell contraction force changes in fibroblasts treated with the agonist histamine , which increases intracellu - lar calcium to elicit contraction , and attenuated by the MLCK inhibitor ML - 7 . It is worth highlighting that conventional col - lagen gel contraction assays have been mainly based on the observation of the change of cell - embedded collagen gel area [ 24 ] , although a few studies have included measurement of the gel thickness [ 25 ] . However , Young’s modulus of the gel should be regarded as one of the key parameters required to estimate the cell contraction force , as described mathe - matically by equation ( 2 . 10 ) . The result ( figures 3 and 5 ) demonstrates the significant increase in cell contraction force after histamine treatment , despite Young’s modulus of col - lagen gel decreasing . Since the treatment conditions or state ofcelldifferentiationmayalterthegelelasticmodulus , careful characterization of the gel elasticity before and after the cul - turing period are critical to accurately determine the cell contraction forces . A significant increase in single cell contraction force by histamine treatment has been demonstrated using this novel technique by combining nano - indentation with mathematical modelling of collagen gel contraction . As reported in the lit - erature [ 7 ] , histamine can elicit an extensive contraction of cells as measured using CGCA . However , adding ML - 7 , a MLCK inhibitor , to the collagen gel can significantly attenu - ate the cellular contraction elicited by histamine , confirming that the fibroblast contraction was mediated via MLC phos - phorylation [ 26 ] . Overall , the order of magnitude of cell contraction forces measured using this novel technique was comparable with those values determined by other methods , e . g . CFM [ 20 , 27 ] . As shown in figure 6 , the single cell contraction force was demonstrated to be cell - density independent . As the hista - mine - treated collagen gels were only allowed to contract for 5 h before the measurement , the cell proliferation during this period was negligible and cell numbers can be reasonably assumed to remain constant throughout the measurements . The single cell contraction force can therefore be calculated by dividing the overall contraction force by the known initial number of cells . However , for longer term measurement ( more than 24 h ) in the cell - density contraction experiments , it was noticeable that cells were aligned on the bottom of the Petri dishes . This implies that there may be a potential cell number loss and the collagen gel liquid content may be reduced [ 1 ] . Moreover , the cell proliferation rate during long - term treatment could cause a significant increase in cell number within the gels .

Nevertheless , fromtheresultsshowninfigure6 b , thesingle cellcontractionforcecanbecalculatedbytheinitialcellseeding number as there was no significant force difference measured between the different cell densities . We have shown that 0 . 1 ! 10 6 cellgel 2 1 is an ideal cell seeding density for the long - term contraction force measurement while a higher cell seeding density , e . g . 0 . 3 ! 10 6 cellgel 2 1 will be desirable for shorter periods of measurement ( less than 24 h ) . This is because with same amount of cells embedded , contraction assays performed soon after seeding ( lessthan 6 h ) will gener - atelessoverallcontractionforcethanmeasurementstakenafter a longer period ( 24 h ) due to cell proliferation . Therefore , increasingcellseedingdensitywouldprovideagreateroverall contraction force and result in more accurate measurements of cell contraction force . The novel technique reported in this study is applicable to assess forces generated by any cell type that can be cultured within a three - dimensional collagen gel and responds to agonist stimulation leading to cell contraction . For example , assessment of forces elicited by vascular smooth muscle cells may indicate the likelihood of a treatment causing contractile responses that may lead to hypertension [ 28 ] while assessment of contraction forces in dermal fibro - blasts may provide insights into the wound healing potential of drugs , anti - wrinkling properties of therapeutic compounds or suitability of three - dimensional gel matrices for tissue - engineering of skin substitutes [ 29 – 31 ] . These are only a few potential applications where the novel technique to assess cellular and gel contraction forces may provide important information for future bioengineering and clinically relevant therapeutic strategies . 5 . Conclusion This study has demonstrated a novel technique to quantify cellular contraction force when cells are embedded in a three - dimensional collagen gel matrix . The histamine - induced contraction of fibroblasts through MLCK activation and MLC phosphorylation , determined in cells seeded in a collagen gel , are in agreement with observations previously reported [ 27 ] . Moreover , the alteration in the collagen gel elasticity before and after histamine treatment was measured . The nonlinear theoretical fittings of collagen gel elasticity are in agreement with the experimental data . The measurements have confirmed that the mechanical property changes of the gel matrix should be taken into account to accurately measure cell contraction forces using gel contraction assays .

Squires 1 1 School of Life Sciences , University of Warwick , Coventry , United Kingdom , 2 School of Engineering , University of Warwick , Coventry , United Kingdom , 3 University Hospital of Coventry and Warwickshire , Coventry , United Kingdom Abstract Ketamine , a mild hallucinogenic class C drug , is the fastest growing ‘party drug’ used by 16 – 24 year olds in the UK . As the recreational use of Ketamine increases we are beginning to see the signs of major renal and bladder complications . To date however , we know nothing of a role for Ketamine in modulating both structure and function of the human renal proximal tubule . In the current study we have used an established model cell line for human epithelial cells of the proximal tubule ( HK2 ) to demonstrate that Ketamine evokes early changes in expression of proteins central to the adherens junction complex . Furthermore we use AFM single - cell force spectroscopy to assess if these changes functionally uncouple cells of the proximal tubule ahead of any overt loss in epithelial cell function . Our data suggests that Ketamine ( 24 – 48 hrs ) produces gross changes in cell morphology and cytoskeletal architecture towards a fibrotic phenotype . These physical changes matched the concentration - dependent ( 0 . 1 – 1 mg / mL ) cytotoxic effect of Ketamine and reflect a loss in expression of the key adherens junction proteins epithelial ( E ) - and neural ( N ) - cadherin and b - catenin . Down - regulation of protein expression does not involve the pro - fibrotic cytokine TGF b , nor is it regulated by the usual increase in expression of Slug or Snail , the transcriptional regulators for E - cadherin . However , the loss in E - cadherin can be partially rescued pharmacologically by blocking p38 MAPK using SB203580 . These data provide compelling evidence that Ketamine alters epithelial cell - to - cell adhesion and cell - coupling in the proximal kidney via a non - classical pro - fibrotic mechanism and the data provides the first indication that this illicit substance can have major implications on renal function . Understanding Ketamine - induced renal pathology may identify targets for future therapeutic intervention . Citation : Hills CE , Jin T , Siamantouras E , Liu IK - K , Jefferson KP , et al .

Hills @ warwick . ac . uk Introduction Ketamine is a tranquilliser that has also found use as an NMDA receptor antagonist in the treatment of human bipolar disorders [ 1 ] . However , in 2006 the UK government made Ketamine a class C drug . Possessing mild hallucinogenic properties , Ketamine is rapidly replacing heroin and methamphetamine as the recrea - tional drug of choice [ 2 ] . Cheap to buy and easily accessible , Ketamine has several street names including ‘‘Special K’’ , ‘‘vitamin K’’ and ‘‘LA Coke’’ . In 2008 , the British Crime Survey revealed that Ketamine was the fastest growing ‘‘party drug’’ among 16 – 24 year olds and it has since been dubbed the ‘‘new ecstasy’’ [ 3 ] . In the UK , Ketamine boasts an estimated 125 , 000 users , with more young people using Ketamine in England and Wales than heroin and crack cocaine combined . As the number of users rise , serious side effects are beginning to emerge . First documented in 2007 , Ketamine has been shown to injure the bladder , causing ulcers ( wounds ) and fibrosis ( stiffening of the bladder walls and shrinkage ) [ 4 ] . Patients present with multiple symptoms including incontinence , bleeding , overactive bladder and bladder shrinkage , as well as damage to both the kidneys and the ureter [ 5 ] . Despite the growing presentation of these complications , there is an acute lack of understanding for the mechanisms that underlie the pathophysiological of Ketamine , and we urgently need to investigate how this mild hallucinogenic drug scars bladder and renal tissue to impair function [ 6 ] . In adults , wound repair is commonly associated with the accumulation of scar tissue ( fibrosis or sclerosis ) . Its effects are variable and often impaired by disease or other pathophysiological insult ( e . g . diabetes / drug abuse ) [ 7 ] . Fibrosis involves excess accumulation of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , primarily composed of collagen . As normal tissue is replaced with scar tissue , a number of phenotypic and morphological changes occur and the fibrosis ultimately results in loss of function [ 8 ] . Regardless of etiology , patients subsequently exhibit a progressive decline in organ function , a largely irreversible process that , in the case of Ketamine abuse , can lead to removal of the bladder and potential end stage renal disease . In both the bladder and kidney , early changes in protein expression / function often occur before overt PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 August 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e71819 128 fibrosis . These changes include a loss of epithelial integrity and dysregulated formation of the intercellular junction , involving , loss of epithelial E - cadherin , altered cell morphology , re - organisation of the cytoskeleton and de - novo expression of fibroblastic markers [ 9 ] . Cadherins have a central role in the formation of the multi - protein adherens junction , which links cell - cell contact to the actin cytoskeleton and various other signalling molecules [ 10 ] . The extracellular domain of the cell adhesion protein E - cadherin mediates ligation with neighbouring cadherins on adjacent cells [ 11 ] , whilst the cytoplasmic domain binds to b - catenin linking cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton via a - catenin . The functional interaction of cadherin with F - actin , via the catenins , not only serves to increase adhesive strength of the junction but also acts as a signalling ‘node’ for proteins that influence adhesiveness & / or initiate intracellular signalling . The loss of E - cadherin mediated cell - to - cell adhesion represents a pivotal step in the transition of renal tubule cells from an epithelial phenotype to one more commonly associated with fibrosis [ 12 ] . Down - regulation of E - cadherin precedes changes in cell morphology , reorganisation of cell architecture and the subsequent gain in expression of phenotypic markers associated with renal pathology [ 12 – 13 ] . In the renal tubule , epithelial function depends on complex cell - cell interactions mediated through the adherens junction . In the current study we present data outlining early toxicological effects of Ketamine on proteins critical to formation of the adherens junction complex in the kidney . Using pharmacological manipu - lation , we examine potential cellular mechanisms orchestrating these changes and utilise high resolution AFM - single - cell force spectroscopy to assess the functional consequence of cell - cell tethering in Ketamine - treated cells exhibiting a loss in cadherin expression . Our data provide compelling evidence that Ketamine reduces cell - cell adhesion in epithelial cells of the proximal tubule . Translated to the in vivo scenario , the subsequent loss of epithelial integrity , structure and function may in part contribute to the toxicological and potential fibrotic response to Ketamine in the kidney . Methods Supplies for tissue culture were purchased from Invitrogen ( Paisley , UK ) . Immobilon P membrane was from Millipore , Watford , UK and ECL from Amersham Biosciences , Buckin - ghamshire , UK . A Qproteome kit was obtained from Qiagen ( Sussex , UK ) . Antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz ( CA , USA ) and R & D systems ( Abingdon , UK ) . Ketamine , TRITC - Phalloidin and Fibronectin , were obtained from Sigma ( Poole , UK ) , as were all other general chemicals . Anti - TGF - b 1 ELISA was obtained from R & D systems . Model Cell Line HK2 cells were obtained from the ATCC Bio - resource Centre ( LGC Standards . Middlesex , UK ) . Cells ( passages 18 – 30 ) were maintained in DMEM / Hams F12 ( DMEM / F12 ) medium , supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , glutamine ( 2 mM ) , and EGF ( 5 ng / ml ) and cultured at 37 u C in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 . Prior to treatment , cells were transferred to DMEM / F12 low glucose ( 5 mM ) for 48 hr as described previously [ 14 ] . Cells were serum starved overnight before applying either Ketamine ( 0 – 1 mg / mL ) in the presence / absence of signalling inhibitors Wortmannin ( 2 m M ) , PD98059 ( 10 m M ) , and SB203580 ( 1 m M ) for 24 hr . Cells were pre - incubated for 30 minutes with their corresponding inhibitors prior to Ketamine application . For assessment of Smad activity HK2 cells were incubated for 0 – 10 minutes with Ketamine ( 1 mg / mL ) . MTT Assay The 3 - ( 4 , 5 - Dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 2 , 5 - diphenyltetrazolium bro - mide ( MTT ) assay is widely used for cytotoxicity assessments of pharmacological and chemical agents . Viable cells transport MTT into their mitochondria , the compound is then reduced to formazin ( purple in color ) , and the latter is quantified color - ometrically . The amount of color formed corresponds to the number of viable cells . HK2 cells were cultured in 96 - well plates ( 5 6 10 3 cells / well ) in 5 mM glucose containing media for 48 hrs prior to an overnight period of serum starvation . Cells were stimulated for 24 and 48 hrs with Ketamine ( 0 . 1 – 1 mg ) and proliferation analyzed using the MTT colorimetric assay ( Roche ) according to manufacturers instructions . The values were presented as a percentage of the MTT uptake that was observed as compared to control cells . Lactate Dehydrogenase Assay Cell death or cytotoxicity is classically evaluated by the quantification of plasma membrane damage . Lactate dehydroge - nase ( LDH ) is a stable enzyme , present in all cell types , and rapidly released into the cell culture medium upon damage of the plasma membrane . Therefore , LDH is a common marker used to determine cytotoxicity . HK2 cells were cultured in 96 - well plates ( 5 6 10 3 cells / well ) in 5 mM glucose containing media for 48 hrs prior to an overnight period of serum starvation . Cells were stimulated for 24 and 48 hrs with Ketamine ( 0 . 1 – 1 mg ) and Lactate dehydrogenase levels assayed using the LDH - cytoxicity assay kit II ( Abcam ) according to manufacturers instructions . The values were presented as a percentage of the LDH release that was observed as compared to control cells . Crystal Violet Assay This is a simple assay useful for obtaining quantitative information about the relative density of cells adhering to multi - well cluster dishes . Crystal Violet stains DNA and upon solubilization , the amount of dye taken up by the monolayer can be quantitated in a plate reader . HK2 cells were cultured in 96 - well plates ( 5 6 10 3 cells / well ) in 5 mM glucose containing media for 48 hrs prior to an overnight period of serum starvation . Cells were stimulated for 24 and 48 hrs with Ketamine ( 0 . 1 – 1 mg ) and cell density determined with crystal violet staining . Briefly , media was removed and cells were fixed for 10 mins with PFA . Following a brief wash with PBS , cells were incubated for 10 mins at room temperature in a 1 % Crystal Violet solution . After this time interval , all traces of dye were removed with distilled water and the stain solubilized with 1 % SDS . The values were presented as a percentage of cells staining in Ketamine treated cells as compared to control cells . Quantification of TGF - b 1 HK2 cells were cultured in 5 mM glucose containing media for 48 hrs prior to an overnight period of serum starvation .

For determination of protein localization , proteins were harvested using the Qproteome cell compartment kit . Membranes were probed with specific polyclon - al antibodies against anti - E - cadherin ( 1 : 2000 ) , N - Cadherin ( 1 : 1000 ) , Snail ( 1 : 1000 ) , Slug ( 1 : 1000 ) , ( 1 : 2000 ) , p - Smad 2 ( 1 : 1000 ) , p - Smad 3 ( 1 : 1000 ) ( all R & D systems ) and beta - catenin ( 1 : 1000 ) ( Santa Cruz ) . Immunocytochemistry Cells at 80 % confluence were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) . Following blocking , the nuclear stain 4 9 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole , dihydrochloride ( DAPI ; 1 mM ) was added for 3 mins . Cells were then incubated with TRITC - conjugated phalloidin ( Sigma ) diluted at 1 : 100 in PBS - Triton for 1 hr at 25 u C . Fluorescence was visualized using an Axiovert 200 fluorescence microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Welwyn Garden City , UK ) . Single Cell Force Spectroscopy Atomic Force Microscopy ( AFM ) Single - Cell Force Spectros - copy ( CellHesion H module , JKP Instruments Germany ) was used to measure cell - cell adhesion and the separation forces required to uncouple cells cultured in Ketamine as compared to control untreated cells . A single HK2 cell was bound to a cantilever using fibronectin ( 20 m g / ml ) and poly - l - lysine ( 25 m g / ml ) and subse - quently brought into contact with an adherent cell ( in a cluster of coupled cells ) using a known force ( 1 nN ) . The two cells remained in contact for a defined period of time ( 10 sec ) whilst bonding formed . The cantilever was then retracted at a constant speed ( 5 m m / sec ) and force ( nN ) versus displacement ( deflection of the cantilever ) measured by the position of a laser beam reflected from the cantilever , until the cells were completely separated ( pulling length 90 m m ) . Each cell - cell recording was repeated in triplicate with a 30 sec pause interval between successive measurements . Retraction recordings from multiple cells ( approx . 40 ) in separate experiments ( n = 4 ) were made and the maximum unbinding force ( nN ) and the detachment energy ( fJoules ) calculated . Analysis Autoradiographs were quantified by densitometry using Total - Lab 2003 ( NonLinear Dynamics , Durham , NC USA ) . Where data was quantified , the non - stimulated , low glucose control condition was normalized to 100 % and data from all other experimental conditions compared to this . Statistical analysis of data was performed using a one - way ANOVA test with a Tukey’s multiple comparison post - test . AFM data was analysed via t - test . Data are expressed as mean 6 SEM , where ‘n’ denotes the number of experiments . A probability ( P ) , 0 . 05 was taken to signify statistical significance . Results The Effect of Ketamine on Cell Viability and Cytoxicity Cells were cultured in 5 mM glucose for 48 hrs prior to being serum starved overnight . Cells were either unstimulated ( control ) or stimulated for 24 – 48 hrs with Ketamine ( 0 . 1 – 1 mg / mL ) under serum - free conditions . Phase contrast microscopy revealed that control HK2 - cells exhibited a typical cobblestone morphology , characteristic of proximal tubular epithelial cells ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) . Exposure to increasing concentrations of Ketamine ( 0 . 1 , 0 . 5 and 1 mg / mL ) for 24 or 48 hrs evoked a concentration - dependent change in morphology towards an elongated fibrous phenotype . Furthermore , cells treated for 48 hrs at the highest concentration ( 1 mg / mL ) , appeared to exhibit cytosolic granulation and a reduction in cell number ( Fig . 1B ) . Cells stimulated for 24 and 48 hrs with Ketamine ( 0 . 1 – 1 mg / mL ) under serum - free conditions were assessed for cell viability by MTT uptake ( uptake directly correlates with the number of viable cells ) . At 24 hrs , incubation with Ketamine at 0 . 5 and 1 mg / mL significantly decreased viability by 22 6 4 % and 39 6 5 % respec - tively as compared to control ( Fig . 1C , P , 0 . 001 , n = 3 ) . At 48 hrs , Ketamine decreased cell viability by 22 6 4 % ( P , 0 . 01 ) , 41 6 3 % ( P , 0 . 001 ) and 45 6 3 % ( P , 0 . 001 ) as compared to control over the same range of concentrations ( Fig . 1D , n = 3 ) . As a complimentary strategy to assess cytotoxicity , we used the Lactate Dehyrdogenase assay as a marker of LDH release into cell supernatant of control versus Ketamine - treated cells . To assess membrane damage , cells were stimulated for 24 and 48 hrs with Ketamine ( 0 . 1 – 1 mg / mL ) under serum - free conditions prior to measuring LDH release . Results are expressed as a % of LDH release as compared to control cells . At 24 hrs , Ketamine ( 1 mg / mL ) increased LDH levels by 62 % to 162 6 17 % of that under control ( 100 % ) conditions ( Fig . 1E , P , 0 . 001 , n = 3 ) , At 48 hrs Ketamine ( 1 mg / mL ) significantly increased LDH levels by 140 % to 240 6 18 % as compared to control ( Fig . 1F ; P , 0 . 001 , n = 3 ) . Release of LDH into the media suggests cell membrane damage and a concentration - dependent cytotoxic effect of Ketamine . To further confirm the toxic role of Ketamine , we measured the number of adherent cells using a crystal violet assay . Cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet ( 1 % w / v ) at 24 and 48 hrs . Quantification of dye uptake was significantly reduced by 14 6 2 % ( P , 0 . 001 ) and 29 6 1 % ( P , 0 . 001 ) at 0 . 5 and 1 mg / mL respec - tively as compared to control at 24 hrs ( Fig . 1G ) , and by 20 6 1 % ( P , 0 . 001 ) and 43 6 2 % ( P , 0 . 001 ) at 48 hrs over the same range of concentrations ( Fig . 1H , n = 3 ) . Based on our observations from all three strategies , subsequent analysis determined the effects of Ketamine ( 0 . 1 – 1 mg / mL ) on cell - to - cell adhesion and adherens junction proteins over the more acute 24 hr time window . The Effect of Ketamine on Expression of Adherens Junction Proteins The transition of tubular epithelial cells from a typical , cobblestone morphology to a fibrotic phenotype is commonly associated with reorganisation of cell architecture and alterations in the expression of epithelial proteins involved in adherens and tight junction formation [ 12 – 13 ] . HK2 cells were cultured in 5 mM glucose containing media for 48 hrs prior to overnight serum starvation . Cells were stimulated for 24 hrs with Ketamine ( 0 . 1 – 1 mg / mL ) under serum - free conditions and morphological and phenotypic changes assessed . At 24 hrs , Ketamine induced a concentration - dependent change in cell morphology towards an elongated fibroblast - like phenotype ( Fig . 2A ) . These gross mor - phological changes were accompanied by re - organisation of the actin cytoskeleton from a diffuse transcellular network of F - actin filaments that spanned the cytosol , into more dense peripheral stress fibres ( Fig . 2B ) . This architectural reorganisation intimates that Ketamine causes dysregulation of the adherens junction complex and has repercussions for the integrity of the epithelial sheet . To resolve these changes , we examined the effects of Ketamine on adherens junction proteins and their transcriptional regulators . Ketamine induced a concentration - dependent decrease in whole - cell expres - sion of E - cadherin by 28 6 1 % ( P , 0 . 01 ) , 52 6 12 % ( P , 0 . 001 ) and 76 6 3 % ( P , 0 . 001 ) as compared to control at 0 . 1 , 0 . 5 and 1 mg / mL respectively ( n = 3 , Fig . 2C ) . The loss in expression reflected a loss in E - cadherin from all cell compartments examined ( Fig . 2Hi ) .

Data suggests that Ketamine down - regulated whole cell expression of Snail by 36 6 13 % ( P , 0 . 05 ) , 51 6 6 % ( P , 0 . 01 ) and 61 6 4 % Figure 2 . Ketamine evoked changes in AJ - protein expression in HK2 - cells . To assess the effect of Ketamine on expression of key AJ proteins , HK2 cells were cultured in 5 mM glucose containing media for 48 hrs prior to overnight serum starvation .

Ketamine altered the cellular localization of all three proteins , compared to control ( panels Hi , Hiv and Hv respectively ) .

Cell compartment analysis highlighted a predominant loss in expression of both these transcription factors from the nucleus ( Fig . 2Hiv and Fig . 2Hv , Snail and Slug respectively ) . Normally exhibiting a reciprocal relationship’s with E - cadherin these data suggest a toxic , but non - lethal effect of Ketamine in cells of the proximal tubule . The cytoplasmic domain of E - cadherin binds to b - catenin to link cell - adhesion to the actin cytoskeleton Ketamine reduced whole cell expression of b - catenin by 28 6 6 % , 28 6 7 % ( P , 0 . 05 ) and 39 6 2 % ( P , 0 . 01 ) as compared to control at 0 . 1 , 0 . 5 and 1 mg / mL ( n = 3 , Fig . 2E ) , an effect attributable to a loss in expression from all 4 cell compartments ( Fig . 2Hiii ) . In the kidney , aloss inE - cadherin expression isoftenparalleled by aconcomitant gain in the expression of neural ( N ) - cadherin , a mechanism commonly referred to as the cadherin switch [ 18 – 19 ] . However , in the current study , Ketamine was unable to induce this compen - satory switch and Ketamine induced a concentration - dependent down - regulation in N - cadherin expression . N - cadherin expression levels decreased in response to Ketamine by to 31 6 7 % , 47 6 3 % ( P , 0 . 001 ) and 75 6 2 % ( P , 0 . 001 ) as compared to control at 0 . 1 , 0 . 5 and 1 mg / mL ( n = 3 , see Fig . 2D ) . Cell compartment analysis revealed that the loss in expression of N - cadherin was attributable to loss in expression at the membrane , nucleus and cytoskeleton fractions of the cell ( Fig . 2Hii ) . The Effects of Ketamine are TGF - b 1 Independent It is well established that TGF - b 1 is a principal mediator of fibrotic changes in the kidney . TGF - b 1 modulates the expression of several epithelial cell recognition and organizational proteins , whilst contributing to the reciprocal loss of tubular epithelial cells and accumulation of interstitial fibroblasts , changes associated with declining excretory function [ 20 – 21 ] . To determine if Ketamine mediated its effects through downstream TGF - b 1 , we examined whether Ketamine stimulated TGF - b 1 secretion ( Fig . 3A ) & / or regulate expression of its downstream signalling intermediates Smad2 and Smad3 ( Fig . 3B and C ) [ 22 ] . Cells were cultured in 5 mM glucose containing media for 48 hrs prior to an overnight serum starvation . Cells were stimulated for 24 hrs with Ketamine ( 0 . 1 – 1 mg / mL ) under serum - free conditions and ELISA was used to measured total TGF - b 1 secretion from growth - arrested HK2 cells . Ketamine significantly decreased total TGF - b 1 secretion from basal control conditions ( 20 pg / ml ) by 69 6 11 % at 0 . 5 and 83 6 6 % at 1 mg / mL as compared to control ( P , 0 . 01 ; Fig . 3A ) . Differences in TGF - b 1 were only detected following acidification of the samples , suggesting that TGF - b 1 was produced in its latent form ( data not shown ) . Smad activity was assessed via immunoblotting . HK2 cells were cultured in 5 mM glucose containing media for 48 hrs prior to overnight serum starvation . Cells were stimulated for 0 – 30 minutes with Ketamine ( 1 mg / mL ) and expression levels of p - Smad2 and p - Smad3 examined . P - Smad2 expression levels decreased by 6 6 3 % , 12 6 17 % , 37 6 7 % , and 68 6 4 % ( P , 0 . 01 ) , at 1 , 5 , 10 and 30 minutes respectively as compared to control ( Fig . 3B , n = 3 ) . P - Smad3 expression levels were also altered in response to Ketamine with levels decreasing 24 6 6 % , 37 6 7 % ( P , 0 . 01 ) , and 79 6 5 % ( P , 0 . 001 ) , at 5 , 10 , and 30 minutes respectively as compared to control ( Fig . 3C , n = 3 ) . The decrease in TGF - b 1 secretion with a concomitant reduction in the associated signalling intermediaries , i . e . Smad 2 and 3 , and the inability of Ketamine to induce reciprocal up - regulation of Snail and N - cadherin to coincide with a loss in E - cadherin , suggest that the cytotoxic effects of Ketamine are independent of TGF - b 1 .

HK2 cells were cultured in 5 mM glucose containing media for 48 hrs prior to overnight serum starvation . Cells were stimulated for 24 hrs with Ketamine ( 0 . 1 – 1 mg / mL ) under serum - free conditions .

Cells were stimulated for 0 – 30 minutes with Ketamine ( 1 mg / mL ) and expression levels of p - P38 and p - P42 / 44 assessed by immunoblotting ( Fig . 4 ) . P - ERK expression levels increased by 166 6 11 % ( P , 0 . 01 ) , 222 6 27 % ( P , 0 . 01 ) and 259 6 30 % ( P , 0 . 01 ) , at 1 , 5 and 10 minutes respectively as compared to control ( Fig . 4A , n = 3 ) . p - P38 expression levels were also altered in response to Ketamine with levels increasing by 63 6 4 % ( P , 0 . 01 ) , and 98 6 25 % ( P , 0 . 001 ) , at 10 and 30 minutes respectively as compared to control ( Fig . 4B , n = 3 ) . Signalling Cascades Regulating the Effects of Ketamine on the Adherens Junction Complex Having confirmed that Ketamine does not depend on TGF - b dependent signalling and that it can evoke activation of MAPK signalling , we examined whether the morphological and pheno - typic effects of Ketamine could be arrested or reversed by pharmacological intervention with downstream inhibitors of the MAPK pathway . Cells were cultured in 5 mM glucose containing media for 48 hrs prior to an overnight serum starvation . Cells were stimulated for 24 hrs with the highest , non - lethal concen - tration of Ketamine ( 1 mg / mL ) in the presence or absence of wortmannin ( 2 m M ) , PD98059 ( 10 m M ) , and SB203580 ( 1 m M ) under serum - free conditions . Phase contrast morphology con - firmed that incubation with wortmannin , PD98059 , or SB203580 partly reversed gross Ketamine induced changes in cell morphol - ogy ( See Fig . 5A ) . Qualitatively , SB203580 treated cells most closely resembled the cobblestone appearance observed under control conditions , and suggest that p38 MAPK may partially mediate the Ketamine response . Restoration of a normal cellular architecture may reflect the partial reclamation of E - cadherin expression following SB203580 treatment ( see Fig . 5C ) . Contra - dictory to this , TRITC - conjugated phalloidin , suggested that the pattern of filamentous F - actin staining seen in control cells , was partially restored following treatment with the ERK inhibitor PD98059 and not SB203580 ( Fig . 5B ) . In order to assess changes in protein expression following inhibition of candidate signaling pathways , cells were cultured in 5 mM glucose for 48 hrs prior to an overnight serum starvation . Cells were then stimulated for 24 hrs with Ketamine in the presence or absence of wortmannin ( 2 m M ) , PD98059 ( 10 m M ) , and SB203580 ( 1 m M ) under serum - free conditions . Whole cell expression of candidate proteins was assessed . At 24 hrs , Ketamine ( 1 mg / mL ) decreased E - cadherin expression by 48 6 7 % of control ( Fig . 5C P , 0 . 001 ) . This effect was compound - ed by co - incubation with the PI3 - K inhibitor wortmannin , with expression decreasing a further 36 % giving a 74 6 5 % reduction in E - cadherin expression as compared to control . Whilst wortmannin exacerbated the effect of Ketamine , PD98059 failed to signifi - cantly alter the Ketamine - evoked loss in E - cadherin . Blocking p38 MAPK improved cadherin expression in response to Ketamine ( n = 3 ; P , 0 . 01 ) , increasing expression by 15 % to 63 6 2 % of that under control conditions and suggesting a role for p38 MAPK in regulating the effects of Ketamine on E - cadherin mediated cell adhesion ( Fig . 5C ) . Contrary to the data above , wortmanin completely reversed the inhibitory effects of Ketamine on Snail expression ( P , 0 . 01 ) and actually increased expression levels by 11 % as compared to that observed under control control conditions ( 111 6 14 % , n = 3 ) ( Fig . 5F ) . As a negative regulator of E - cadherin , an increase in Snail in response inhibition of PI3 - K could account for the exacerbated reduction of E - cadherin expression observed in Fig . 5C . The transcriptional repressors Snail and Slug are both situated at the core of several signaling pathways proposed to mediate EMT and are central to the regulation of E - cadherin [ 12 – where * * P , 0 . 01 and * * * P , 0 . 001 .

As with Snail , Ketamine decreased Slug expression ( Fig . 5G ) by 72 6 4 % as compared to control ( P , 0 . 001 ) . Neither wortman - nin nor SB203580 were able to significantly attenuate the inhibitory effect of Ketamine , however , inhibition of ERK regained the expression of Slug ( P , 0 . 05 ) , and suggests potential involvement of ERK in regulating the effects of Ketamine over Slug expression ( n = 3 ) . In support of the data in Fig . 2 , Ketamine evoked a down - regulation in both N - cadherin and b - catenin with expression levels decreasing by 73 6 3 % and 50 6 4 % respectively as compared to control ( P , 0 . 001 ; Fig . 5D and E ) . None of the inhibitors were able to negate the effects of Ketamine on these two proteins . It should be noted that treatment with inhibitors alone , did not significantly alter the expression of our five candidate proteins ( see Figure S1 ) . Ketamine Reduces Functional Tethering between Cells of the Proximal Tubule Atomic Force Microscopy ( AFM ) Single - Cell Force Spectros - copy was used to measure cell - to - cell adhesion and the separation forces and energies required to uncouple cells [ 23 ] . Prior to attachment , cells were cultured for 48 hrs under identical conditions + / 2 Ketamine ( 0 . 1 – 1 mg / mL ) . A single HK2 cell was bound to a cantilever and subsequently brought into contact with an adherent cell within a cluster , using a fixed force . After 10 sec , the cantilever was retracted ( 5 m m / sec ) and force versus displacement measured until the cells were completely separated . Retraction force - displacement curves provide important informa - tion regarding the adhesion between two cells , such as the energy required to separate them ( the grey area in Fig . 6A – D ) and maximum force of detachment ( the red circles in Fig . 6A – D ) . The energy required to separate two cells is normally referred to as ‘‘detachment energy’’ ( Fig . 6E ) whilst the maximum force of detachment for complete separation the ‘‘maximum unbinding force’’ ( Fig . 6F ) . The retraction measurements of control versus Ketamine ( 0 . 1 – 1 mg / mL ) - treated cells are shown in panels E & F . In each case , data is recorded from multiple cells ( . 10 ) in 4 separate experiments at each concentration . Compared to control ( 0 mg / mL ) , Ketamine evokes a concentration - dependent decrease in the maximum unbinding force by 33 6 6 % , 41 6 3 % , and 58 6 6 % at 0 . 1 mg / mL , 0 . 5 mg / mL and 1 mg / mL respectively ( P , 0 . 001 ) , whilst the detachment energy decreased by 32 6 8 % , 63 6 7 % , and 86 6 11 % of control at 0 . 1 mg / mL , 0 . 5 mg / mL and 1 mg / mL respectively ( P , 0 . 001 ) . Discussion In the UK , Ketamine is fast becoming the ‘‘party drug’’ of choice amongst 16 – 24 year olds . The Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs ( ISCD ) found that 68 % of UK clubbers had taken the drug in 2009 , whilst the British Crime Survey reported an increase in users from 85 , 000 in 2006 / 07 to 113 , 000 in 2008 / 09 [ 2 ] . Although effective as a mild hallucinogen at 60 mg to 100 mg , some users are reportedly taking 5 g to 10 g a day . Stimulated by public concern about the popularity and potential harms of Ketamine , our study coincides with a recent BBC report in which the UK Home Secretary Theresa May , asked the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) to update their advice on the abuse of ketamine . As the number of users increases , serious side effects are beginning to emerge . These effects , including bladder shrinkage , fibrosis , incontinence and bleeding , can ultimately lead to complete destruction and subsequent removal of the bladder [ 4 ] . Whilst the effects of Ketamine on the bladder are established , recent evidence suggests that damage to other tissues is also on the increase , and patients regularly present with both bladder and renal complications [ 24 ] . The escalating problem highlights an urgent need to improve our understanding of how Ketamine mediates its effects on the entire urological system . In epithelia cells of the proximal tubule , disease - induced fibrosis commonly presents with cell atrophy , increased matrix deposition and tubulointerstitial scarring , all of which culminate in a loss of renal function [ 25 – 27 ] . The reciprocal loss of tubular epithelial cells and accumulation of interstitial fibroblasts promotes chronic fibrosis . Characteristic changes include morphological and phe - notypic alterations with cytoskeletal reorganization and the down - regulation of epithelial cell adhesion molecules , such as E - cadherin . The integrity of the adherens junction is vital to maintain basic epithelial function and the loss of E - cadherin mediated cell - adhesion represents a pivotal step in early pheno - typic and morphological changes observed in tubular injury [ 25 ] [ 28 ] . Changes in adherens junction proteins are central to early morphological and phenotypic alterations that precede overt signs of tissue damage . The aim of the current study was to understand of how Ketamine altered cell adhesion and cell - coupling in epithelial cells of the proximal tubule . Assessing cell morphology confirmed that Ketamine produced a concentration - dependent change in cellular architecture towards an elongated fibrotic phenotype at 24 and 48 hrs . The reduction in both MTT uptake and crystal violet staining was consistent with reduced cell viability and concomitant to an increase of lactate dehydrogenase release , confirming cytotoxicity . We confirmed that Ketamine reduced membrane expression of E - cadherin and showed for the first time that the drug decreases functional tethering between cells of the proximal tubule , a potentially catastrophic event in cells whose primary function depends on formation of a tight epithelial sheet . Whilst our previous studies in the proximal tubule suggest that a pro - fibrotic loss of E - cadherin is paralleled by an up - regulation of transcriptional repressors Snail and Slug , the effects of Ketamine appear toxic and are not mediated via classic signalling pathways [ 17 – 18 ] . The actin cytoskeleton stabilizes both tight junctions and adherent junctions and alterations in actin dynamics disrupt E - cadherin - mediated adhesion [ 29 – 30 ] . TRITC - conjugated phal - loidin revealed that Ketamine redistributed F - actin in to stress fibres at the cell periphery . This data was supported by a significant reduction in expression of E - cadherin at the cell membrane , a response that , unlike classic renal fibrosis , was not paralleled by up - regulation in expression of transcription factors Snail and Slug . Furthermore , the cadherin - switch associated with conjugated phalloidin ( panel B ) were used to confirm if blockade of PI3 - K , ERK or p38 MAPK was able to negate Ketamine - induced changes in cell morphology and cytoskeletal reorganization . HK2 cells were cultured in 5 mM glucose containing media for 48 hrs prior to overnight serum starvation . Cells were stimulated with Ketamine ( 1 mg / mL ) for 24 hrs in the presence or absence of Wortmannin ( 2 m M ) , PD98059 ( 10 m M ) , and SB203580 ( 1 m M ) underserum - freeconditionsandtheexpressionlevelsofE - cadherin ( panelC ) , N - cadherin ( panelD ) , b - catenin ( panelE ) , Snail ( panel F ) and Slug ( panel G ) determined by immuno - blotting .

These data suggest that the effects of Ketamine are cytotoxic , and not mediated through classic , canonical pathways usually associated with renal fibrosis . TGF - b 1 is a pro - fibrotic cytokine known to play an important role in the pathogenesis of disease - induced renal fibrosis , e . g . diabetic nephropathy [ 27 ] . Having previously shown that TGF - b 1 instigates a loss in E - cadherin expression in HK2 - cells , we investigated if Ketamine directly altered TGF - b 1 secretion [ 18 ] . Ketamine ( 1 mg / mL ) reduced TGF - b 1 secretion to 80 % of control . In renal fibrosis , TGF - b 1 binds to a trans - membrane TBRII receptor and initiates several intracellular signalling cascades , including the small mothers against decapentaplegic ( SMADs ) and mitogen activated protein kinases ( MAPK ) , such as extracellular regulated kinase ( ERK ) , p38 and Jun Kinase [ 22 ] . The majority of TGF - b 1 targeted genes regulated in fibrosis rely on Smad3 - dependent transcriptional regulation ( Brown et al . 2007 ) . In the current study , Ketamine not only decreased TGF - b 1 secretion but also down - regulated p - Smad2 and p - Smad3 expression at 24 hours . The failure of Ketamine to stimulate canonical TGF - b 1 signalling suggests that an alternative Figure6 . Ketaminereducescelladhesion .

Co - incubation of Ketamine with inhibitors of PI3 - K , p38 MAPK and ERK confirmed a partial role for all three in regulating our candidate proteins . There was a counter - intuitive relationship observed between E - cadherin and Snail in response to Ketamine treatment in the presence of the PI3 - K inhibitor wortmannin . Blockade of PI3 - K signalling further reduced the expression of E - cadherin , an effect most likely to reflect the dramatic up - regulation Snail under the same conditions . This suggests that Ketamine down - regulates Snail expression in a PI3 - K dependent manner and that blockade of this pathway restores the reciprocal relationship between E - cadherin and its transcriptional repressor . Inhibition of p38MAPK partially restored E - cadherin expression to those of control , an effect that may , in part , be responsible for the restoration of cell morphology observed with SB203580 . Co - incubation of Ketamine with wortmannin failed to negate the inhibitory effects of Ketamine on Slug , whilst the ERK inhibitor , PD98059 , restored expression to approximately 50 % of control , indicating a downstream involvement ERK in regulating Slug . Whilst it was evident that PI3 - K and ERK have a role in regulating E - cadherin , Snail and Slug , elucidating the pathway controlling N - cadherin and b - catenin expression was not clear . Ketamine reduced the expression of both these proteins and the effect could not be restored by pharmacological inhibition . To determine how a loss in adherens junction proteins functionally affected cell - cell adhesion , we used AFM - SCFS . The AFM - single - cell force spectroscopy used in this study has a displacement actuator of longer travelling distance ( up to 100 m m ) which provides an excellent capability for measuring the complete force - displacement curve of cell detachment and is essential when studying large cells such as those as found in renal tubule epithelia . Retraction force - displacement curves allow us to determine the force and energy required to uncouple cells . The former is normally referred to as ‘‘adhesion force’’ and the latter the ‘‘detachment energy’’ , which can be calculated from the integra - tion of the separation force - displacement curves , i . e . the grey area under the curve in Fig . 6A – D . Retraction force - displacement curves confirmed that 1 mg / mL Ketamine reduced the maximum unbinding force required to begin separation of two cells by 58 % , whilst reducing the detachment energy required to completely separate them by 86 % . The greater decrease in the detachment energy could be partly explained due to the increase in cell rigidity following Ketamine treatment , as demonstrated by re - arrange - ment of the cytoskeleton into peripheral stress fibres . These data suggest that it is the loss in E - cadherin expression and dissolution of the catenin / cadherin complex , which drives the detachment of cells in response to Ketamine . In the current study , we report on Ketamine - evoked cytotoxic damage to epithelial cells of the proximal tubule . The acute effects of Ketamine are associated with early functional changes in the adherens junction complex . This loss in expression of proteins central to cell - adhesion , promotes functional disassociation of the epithelia , and is the most likely cause of early morphological and phenotypic alterations observed following Ketamine exposure . The reported changes may represent the initial basis for overt renal complications of Ketamine abuse . Whilst our studies provide novel and exciting data on the effects of this recreational drug in the proximal tubule , it is clear that this area of research demands fuller investigation . To reduce the confounding influence of the multifactorial molecular pathology that is likely to underlie Ketamine - induced renal damage within epithelia cells of the proximal tubule , we utilized the well - characterized human HK2 cell line as a minimalistic model . Despite HK2 cells having many advantages to primary tissue , the authors concede that responses are open to modification by the complexities of the in vivo situation . Despite this caveat , the current data provides a compelling foundation , identifying likely targets associated with early Ketamine damage , and as such , identifies future candidates for maintaining or restoring renal function in response to and from this toxic substance particularly given the catastrophic tissue damage reported for the bladder . Future work will need to extrapolate these data in to the primary scenario . Supporting Information Figure S1 The effect of Inhibitors alone on candidate protein expression in HK2 cells .

Cells were cultured in phenol red - free Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagles medium ( DMEM , Sigma - Aldrich UK ) containing 1000 mg L   1 glucose and supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , L - glutamine ( 5 mM ) , penicillin ( 100 U ml   1 ) and streptomycin ( 100 ug ml   1 ) . Cells were maintained in an atmosphere of air at 37 ￿ and 5 % CO 2 . Experiments were conducted with cells from passages 7 - 9 . Once cells had reached conﬂuence in the T25 ﬂask , they were detached using trypsin / EDTA ( 0 . 1 % trypsin and 0 . 02 % EDTA ) in sterile phosphate - bu ↵ ered saline ( PBS ) . The detachment of cells was checked using an inverted light microscope ( Nikon , TMS ) . The trypsin / EDTA was inactivated using phenol red - free DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS ( 37 ￿ ) . The cells were then resuspended and trans - ferred to T75 ( culture area 75 cm 2 ) ﬂasks . Once conﬂuence was reached , cells were further subcultured into T75 ﬂasks or in 6 - , 24 - or 96 - well plates for experiments . The media was replaced every 2 days until an 80 % - 95 % conﬂuent monolayer was observed . Culture of HK2 cells HK2 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ; Gaithersburg , MD 20878 USA ) . The cells at passages 18 - 30 were maintained in DMEM / Hams F12 ( DMEM / F12 , Sigma - Aldrich UK ) medium , supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , L - glutamine ( 2 mM ) , and epidermal growth factor ( 5 ng ml   1 ) . During culturing , the seeding and medium change procedure is same as the culture of HAoAF . Cells were then seeded onto 40 mm Petri dishes and cultured at 37 ￿ in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 in air for further experiments . 140 Cell counting To seed the number of HAoAF for experiments ( see Table A . 1 ) , cell density was determined using a Neubauer modiﬁed counting chamber ( Figure A . 1a ) . Conﬂuent ﬁbroblasts at passage 7 - 9 were trypsinised and resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS . For counting , a random 20 µ l of cell suspension was transferred onto two haemocytometer chambers ( 10 µ l for each chamber ) . The total number of cells overlying on four 1 mm 2 areas of the haemocytometer ( blue framed area in Figure A . 1b ) were counted using an inverted light microscope ( 4 ⇥ objective magniﬁcation ) .
