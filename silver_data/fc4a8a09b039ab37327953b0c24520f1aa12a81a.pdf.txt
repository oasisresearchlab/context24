Despite extensive research throughout the past decade , the mechanistic origin of these stiffness variations remains elusive . Here we show that brain tissue stiffness is correlated to the underlying tissue microstructure and directly proportional to the local myelin content . In 116 indentation tests of six freshly harvested bovine brains , we found that the cerebral stiffnesses of 1 . 33 ± 0 . 63 kPa in white matter and 0 . 68 ± 0 . 20 kPa in gray matter were signiﬁcantly different ( p < 0 . 01 ) . Strikingly , while the inter - specimen variation was rather moderate , the minimum and maximum cerebral white matter stiffnesses of 0 . 59 ± 0 . 19 kPa and 2 . 36 ± 0 . 64 kPa in each brain varied by a factor of four on average . To provide a mechanistic interpretation for this variation , we performed a histological characterization of the tested brain regions . We stained the samples with hematoxylin and eosin and luxol fast blue and quantiﬁed the local myelin content using image analysis . Interestingly , we found that the cerebral white matter stiffness increased with increasing myelin content , from 0 . 72kPa at a myelin content of 64 – 2 . 45kPa at a myelin content of 89 % , with a Pearson correlation coefﬁcient of q ¼ 0 : 91 ( p < 0 . 01 ) . This direct correla - tion could have signiﬁcant neurological implications . During development , our results could help explain why immature , incompletely myelinated brains are softer than mature , myelinated brains and more vul - nerable to mechanical insult as evident , for example , in shaken baby syndrome . During demyelinating disease , our ﬁndings suggest to use stiffness alterations as clinical markers for demyelination to quantify the onset of disease progression , for example , in multiple sclerosis . Taken together , our study indicates that myelin might play a more important function than previously thought : It not only insulates signal propagation and improves electrical function of single axons , it also provides structural support and mechanical stiffness to the brain as a whole . Statement of Signiﬁcance Increasing evidence suggests that the mechanical environment of the brain plays an important role in neuronal development and disease . Reported stiffness values vary signiﬁcantly , but the origin of these variations remains unknown . Here we show that stiffness of our brain is correlated to the underlying tis - sue microstructure and directly proportional to the local myelin content . Myelin has been discovered in 1854 as an insulating layer around nerve cells to improve electric signal propagation . Our study now shows that it also plays an important mechanical role : Using a combined mechanical characterization and histological characterization , we found that the white matter stiffness increases linearly with increasing myelin content , from 0 . 5 kPa at a myelin content of 63 – 2 . 5 kPa at 92 % .

Motivation Increasing evidence suggests that the mechanical environment of the brain plays an important role in neuronal development [ 1 ] and disease [ 2 ] . Magnetic resonance elastography now allows us to characterize this mechanical environment in vivo [ 3 ] , and per - form non - invasive , repeated measurements to quantify regional and temporal stiffness variations in the living brain [ 4 ] . Recent studies have successfully used magnetic resonance elastography to correlate alterations in brain stiffness to neurodegeneration in chronic neurological disorders [ 5 ] and in aging [ 6 , 7 ] . However , the precise mechanistic origin of these stiffness variations is unknown . Our brain consists of an outer gray matter layer made up of neu - ronal cell bodies , dendrites , and unmyelinated axons and an inner white matter core composed of oligodendrocytes , astrocytes , microglia , and a dense network of myelinated axons . The myelin sheath around nerve ﬁbers was ﬁrst discovered by Rudolf Virchow in 1854 and has since then been subject of extensive investigation [ 8 ] . We now know that myelin plays a critical role in insulating sig - nal propagation and improving electrical function . Myelin consists of 40 % water and its dry mass is composed of 70 – 85 % lipids and 15 – 30 % protein [ 9 ] . In human brain development , the ﬁrst myelin sheaths form around week 14 of gestation ; yet , the most progres - sive phase of myelination is aligned with an infant’s rapid develop - ment during the ﬁrst year of life . Dysmyelination , the defective formation of insulating myelin sheaths , is a manifestation of genetic mutations associated with leukodystrophies and also pre - sent in cases of schizophrenia [ 10 ] . Demyelination , the progressive loss of myelin sheaths , is a classical hallmark of several neurode - generative autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis [ 11 ] . While the electrical effects of altered myelin concentrations are widely recognized , the mechanical effects of myelin remain poorly understood . This is the objective of the present study . A robust , reliable , and reproducible method to characterize the mechanical behavior of the brain is indentation testing [ 12 ] . While tissue indentation is only rarely used to probe living brain in vivo [ 13 ] , it is currently gaining popularity as a high - resolution , high - ﬁdelity approach to probe individual different regions of gray and white matter tissue in vitro [ 14 , 15 ] . On the cellular level , atomic force microscopy indentation suggests that gray matter is about twice as stiff as white matter , both in mice [ 16 ] and rats [ 17 ] . On the tissue level , mechanical indentation tests reveal the opposite with gray matter being about one third softer than white matter , both in pigs [ 12 , 18 ] and sheep [ 14 ] . On the whole organ level , magnetic resonance elastography suggests that gray and white matter are rather indistinguishable in vivo , both in ferrets [ 4 ] and humans [ 19 ] . Discrepancies in these measurements not only reﬂect the extreme strain rate sensitivity of brain tissue , but also its non - linear behavior [ 15 , 20 ] and its compression stiffening [ 21 ] . This study seeks to unravel the ongoing controversy between gray and white matter stiffness measurements . 2 . Materials and methods Our experimental study combined mechanical characterization via indentation testing and histological characterization via stain - ing to correlate mechanical parameters to tissue microstructure . We analyzed six fresh bovine brains collected from a local slaughterhouse ( Martin’s Custom Butchering , Wakarusa , IN ) . Fig . 1 illustrates a representative sagittal brain slice prepared for mechanical and histological characterization . 2 . 1 . Mechanical characterization Within two hours post mortem , we prepared 5 mm - thick sagit - tal slices with a consistent offset relative to the midline using a custom - designed slicing tool , placed them in a 100 mm - diameter petri dish , and mounted the dish into a Hysitron TI 950 TriboInden - ter TM ( Hysitron Inc . , Eden Prairie , MN ) with an xZ 500 extended displacement stage [ 14 ] . This setup allows for indenter tip displace - ments of up to 500 l m with a 1 nm displacement control precision and a force measurement resolution of < 0 . 1 nN . We performed all measurements at room temperature , under displacement control , using a custom - made 1 . 5 mm diameter ﬂat punch indenter [ 22 , 23 ] . We stabilized each indentation region with a 12 mm - diameter stainless steel washer and hydrated the tissue surface inside the washerwith phosphate - bufferedsalinesolution to prevent specimen gray ma(cid:2)er anterior posterior gray ma(cid:2)er white ma(cid:2)er 1cm ﬁxed slice stained sample white ma(cid:2)er fresh sagi(cid:2)al slice anterior posterior Fig . 1 .

Fig . 2 . Characteristic force – displacement behavior under displacement control . We prescribed a trapezoidal loading - holding - unloading proﬁle with a maximum indenter displacement of 400 l m , at a loading and unloading rate of 5 l m / s , and a holding time at maximum indentation of 10s . We automatically detected the indenter - sample separation point upon unloading , and consistently zeroed all force and displacement measurements retrospectively with respect to this point ( dashed line ) . We interpreted the mean slope at 100 ± 10 l m of the loading curve as the contact stiffness k of each measurement ( black line in gray box ) . 266 J . Weickenmeier et al . / Acta Biomaterialia 42 ( 2016 ) 265 – 272 dehydration and minimize adhesion . Fig . 2 illustrates a characteristic force – displacement curve of our mechanical characterization . We prescribed a trapezoidal loading - holding - unloading proﬁle with a maximum indenterdisplacementof400 l m ata loading andunload - ing rate of 5 l m / s and a holding time at maximum indentation of 10 s [ 14 ] . Upon loading , the indentation force increased gradually . During the short holding period , the force decreased as the tissue stress relaxed . Upon unloading , the indentation force decreased , became negative as the indentor tip was pulled down by tissue adhe - sion , and returned to its initial value upon complete separation of tip and sample . We automatically detected the separation point during unloading , and consistently zeroed all force and displacement mea - surements retrospectively with respect to this point . We interpreted the mean slope at 100 ± 10 l m of the loading curve as the contact stiffness k of each measurement . For this contact stiffness , we deter - mined the effective elastic modulus [ 24 ] , E eff ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃ p p k 2 ﬃﬃﬃ A p ; ð 1 Þ where A ¼ 1 = 4 p d 2 is the cross - sectional area of the ﬂat punch with diameter d . The effective modulus generally accounts for the elastic deformation in both sample and indenter , 1 E eff ¼ 1 (cid:3) m 2smp E smp þ 1 (cid:3) m 2ind E ind ; ð 2 Þ where E smp and E ind are the Young’s moduli and m smp and m ind are the Poisson’s ratios of the sample and the indenter . Assuming that the stiffness of the indenter is orders of magnitudes larger than the sample , E ind (cid:4) E smp , and that the tissue is nearly incompressible , m smp (cid:5) 0 : 5 , we obtained the following linear relation between the sample stiffness E smp and the contact stiffness k , E smp ¼ 1 (cid:3) m 2smp h i E eff ¼ 3 4 k d : ð 3 Þ We tested six different mammalian brains and performed a total of n = 116 indentation tests . For each brain , we performed three measurements in cerebral gray matter and in cerebellar white matter , resulting in a total of n = 18 measurements each . In addition , we performed a series of 12 – 18 white matter measure - ments along the anterior - posterior arch as illustrated in Fig . 5 , resulting in a total of n = 80 measurements in cerebral white mat - ter . We did not test cerebellar gray matter because those regions were too small for our current test setup and indenter diameter . 2 . 2 . Histological characterization Following mechanical testing we prepared three randomly selected samples for light microscopy . We ﬁxed the slices using 10 % buffered formalin of 4 % formaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline solution . We cut each slice into 4 cm (cid:2) 4 cm samples , grad - ually dehydrated the samples by replacing tissue water by alcohol , cleared the samples by replacing alcohol by xylene , and embedded the dehydrated samples in parafﬁn wax blocks . From these , we prepared 8 – 10 nm thick histological slices using a microtome . We stained the slices using hematoxylin and eosin ( H & E ) , where hematoxylin colors cell nuclei in blue and a subsequent counter - staining with eosin colors eosinophilic intracellular and extracellu - lar protein structures in shades of red , pink , and orange . We further stained the slices using luxol fast blue ( LFB ) , where myelin appears in blue , neuropil in pink , and nerve cells in purple . At the macro - scopic scale , combined hematoxylin and eosin and luxol fast blue staining allowed us to differentiate between gray and white matter tissue ; at the microscopic scale , it allowed us to characterize the myelin content in white matter tissue . Using the image analysis tools of MATLAB , we quantiﬁed the relative area fraction of the red - and blue - colored regions in the combined stain , and inter - preted the blue - colored area fraction as the local myelin content . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Mechanical characterization Fig . 3 summarizes the stiffnesses of different tissue types for six brains and a total of n = 116 indentation tests . We tested a total of n = 80 samples of cerebral white matter , n = 18 samples of cerebral gray matter , and n = 18 samples of cerebellar white matter . Individual measurements are indicated as dots ; means and standard deviations are shown as bar graphs . Fig . 4 summarizes the stiffnesses in the white matter cerebrum , the gray matter cerebrum , and the white matter cerebellum across all six brains . We measured a cerebral white matter stiffness of 1 . 33 ± 0 . 63 kPa , a cerebral gray matter stiffness of 0 . 68 ± 0 . 20 kPa , and a cerebellar white matter stiffness of 0 . 75 ± 0 . 29 kPa . The mean stiffness in cerebral white matter with 1 . 33 kPa was almost twice as large as in cerebral gray matter with 0 . 68 kPa and cerebellar white matter with 0 . 75 kPa , which displayed comparable stiff - nesses . An analysis of variance of the stiffness measurements in cerebral white matter , cerebral gray matter , and cerebellar white matter yielded a signiﬁcant variation among the three tissue types , F = 3 . 68 ( p < 0 . 01 ) . A post hoc Tukey’s test revealed that the stiffness of cerebral white matter was signiﬁcantly different from both cerebral gray matter and cerebellar white matter ( p < 0 . 01 ) ; stiffness values for cerebral and cerebellar white matter were not signiﬁcantly different . Interestingly , the standard deviation in Fig . 3 . Stiffnesses of different tissue types in six brains . We tested a total of n = 80 samples of cerebral white matter , n = 18 samples of cerebral gray matter , and n = 18 samples of cerebellar white matter .

Weickenmeier et al . / Acta Biomaterialia 42 ( 2016 ) 265 – 272 267 cerebral white matter with 47 % was noticeably larger than in cere - bral gray matter with 29 % and in cerebellar white matter with 39 % . Fig . 5 illustrates the stiffnesses of different cerebral white mat - ter regions in three representative brains . The average stiffness dis - played moderate inter - specimen variations . It varied from 1 . 74 ± 0 . 53 kPa for brain 1 , to 1 . 16 ± 0 . 57 kPa for brain 3 , and 1 . 28 ± 0 . 74 kPa for brain 5 . However , within each individual brain , the stiffness displayed marked regional variations along the anterior - posterior arch . The average minimum and maximum stiff - nesses were 0 . 59 ± 0 . 19 kPa and 2 . 36 ± 0 . 64 kPa . For the displayed brains , stiffness values ranged from 0 . 64 kPa to 2 . 93 kPa in brain 1 , from 0 . 50 kPa to 2 . 53 kPa in brain 3 , and from 0 . 34 kPa to 2 . 49 kPa in brain 5 . Brain 5 displayed the largest regional variation , with the smallest and largest stiffnesses varying by almost one order of magnitude . By clustering our cerebral white matter stiff - ness data across all six brains using partitioning around medoids , we observed a statistically signiﬁcant stiffness difference in the anterior and posterior regions . In fact , a t - test conﬁrmed Fig . 5 . Stiffnesses of different regions of cerebral white matter . The cerebral white matter stiffnesses in the anterior and posterior regions across all six brains were signiﬁcantly different ( p < 0 . 01 ) . Stiffnesses ranged from 0 . 64 kPa to 2 . 93 kPa in brain 1 , from 0 . 50 kPa to 2 . 53 kPa in brain 3 , and from 0 . 34 kPa to 2 . 49 kPa in brain 5 . To explore to what extent these variations were correlated to the underlying tissue microstructure , we performed a histological characterization of eight samples , indicated through the gray boxes . Fig . 4 . Stiffnesses of different tissue types in six brains . The cerebral white matter stiffness was 1 . 33 ± 0 . 63 kPa , the cerebral gray matter stiffness was 0 . 68 ± 0 . 20 kPa , and the cerebellar white matter stiffness was 0 . 75 ± 0 . 29 kPa . An analysis of variance and a post hoc Tukey’s test revealed that the stiffness of cerebral white matter was signiﬁcantly different from both cerebral gray matter and cerebellar white matter ( ⁄⁄ p < 0 . 01 ) .

Weickenmeier et al . / Acta Biomaterialia 42 ( 2016 ) 265 – 272 ( p < 0 . 01 ) that the anterior stiffness of 0 . 95 ± 0 . 32 kPa was signiﬁ - cantly lower than posterior stiffness of 2 . 04 ± 0 . 45 kPa . From a macrostructural inspection of the anterior and posterior regions in Fig . 5 , we observed no visible difference that could explain such a large stiffness variation . To test our hypothesis that this variation is correlated with the underlying tissue microstructure , we pre - pared eight representative regions , highlighted through the gray boxes in Fig . 5 , for a thorough histological characterization . 3 . 2 . Histological characterization Fig . 6 shows representative histological stains of ﬁve different brain regions . The individual columns display the combined hema - toxylin and eosin and luxol fast blue stain , left , the hematoxylin and eosin stain , middle , and the luxol fast blue stain , right . The individual rows illustrate the microstructural speciﬁcity at ﬁve dif - ferent locations , at the gray and white matter interface in a gyrus ( a ) and in a sulfcus ( b ) , in the cerebellar white matter ( c ) , and in cerebral white matter with high ( d ) and low ( e ) myelin content . The percentage values in each stain indicate the red - and blue - colored area fractions , which we interpret as the regional protein and myelin contents . In Fig . 6 ( a ) and ( b ) , at the gray and white matter interface , the myelin content is a global macrostructural indicator for the transition from gray to white matter . In Fig . 6 ( d ) and ( e ) , in the cerebral white matter , the myelin content is a local microstructural indicator for the degree of myelination , which varies from 56 % in Fig . 6 ( e ) to 81 % in Fig . 6 ( d ) . Fig . 7 illustrates the stiffness - myelin relation in the eight differ - ent regions of cerebral white matter indicated through the gray boxes in Fig . 5 . The color - coded dots indicate the mean stiffness and mean myelin content in each region ; the gray ellipses illustrate the associated standard deviations in stiffness and in myelin con - tent . The cerebral white matter stiffness increased with increasing myelin content , from 0 . 72 kPa at a myelin content of 64 – 2 . 45 kPa at a myelin content of 89 % . Stiffness and myelin content were highly correlated with a Pearson correlation coefﬁcient of q ¼ 0 : 91 ( p < 0 . 01 ) . 4 . Discussion 4 . 1 . Mechanical characterization With an increasing recognition of the physical environment of the brain [ 25 , 26 ] , the mechanical characterization of gray and white matter tissue is receiving growing attention [ 1 , 2 ] . Yet , the material properties reported in the literature continue to show variations of one order of magnitude and more [ 27 ] . At the same time , a direct comparison of the reported parameter values remains challenging because of differences in experimental meth - ods , loading protocols , and sample preparation [ 28 ] . As an experi - mental method , we selected indentation testing and equipped a commercially available test set - up for nanoindentation with an extended displacement stage and a custom - designed 1 . 5 mm diameter ﬂat - punch indenter . As we have perviously shown , this set - up allows us to probe freshly harvested fully intact tissue slices , reduce tissue degradation , and minimize sample dehydra - tion [ 14 ] . As loading protocol , we selected a slow displacement - controlled loading - holding - unloading proﬁle , which we analyzed using a custom - designed , semi - automatic procedure . This approach successfully minimized tissue adhesion , which plays a critical role during ultrasoft matter indentation [ 29 ] . 4 . 2 . Gray and white matter stiffnesses The current brain mechanics literature features an ongoing con - troversy about the stiffnesses of gray and white matter , with sev - eral studies reporting gray matter to be twice as stiff as white [ 16 , 17 ] , several ﬁnding reporting gray matter to be one third softer than white matter [ 14 , 12 , 18 ] , and several studies reporting no sig - niﬁcant stiffness differences [ 4 , 19 ] . Knowing the precise stiffness ratio between gray and white matter is signiﬁcant , since this ratio plays a critical role during cortical folding in human brain develop - ment [ 30 , 31 ] . One objective of our study was therefore to explain the discrepancy between gray and white matter stiffness measure - ments . In n = 116 stiffness measurements highlighted in Fig . 3 , we found that the cerebral white and gray matter stiffnesses were sig - niﬁcantly different ( p < 0 . 01 ) ; cerebral white matter was on aver - age twice as stiff as cerebral gray matter . Interestingly , white matter , with a standard deviation of 49 % , displayed a signiﬁcantly larger variation than gray matter , with a standard deviation of 29 % . This observation agrees well with ﬁndings in the literature , which also reported white matter to be stiffer than gray , with a larger standard deviation [ 12 ] . This previous study attributed the large regional stiffness variation in white matter to its more anisotropic and heterogeneous microstructure , compared to the rather isotro - pic and homogeneous microstructure of gray matter [ 32 , 33 ] . While gray matter consists primarily of neuronal cell bodies , dendrites , and unmyelinated axons , white matter is heterogeneously made up of myelinated axons and other cell types , oligodendrocytes , astrocytes , and microglia [ 34 , 35 ] . Fig . 5 illustrates the large stan - dard deviation in white matter stiffness in three representative brains . The average maximum white matter stiffness across all six brains was 2 . 36 ± 0 . 64 kPa , which is four times larger than the average minimum white matter stiffness of 0 . 59 ± 0 . 19 kPa . In each of the six analyzed brains , the smallest white matter stiffness was smaller than the brain’s average gray matter stiffness , and the lar - gest white matter stiffness was larger . These results suggest that , even when using the same experimental method , the same loading protocol , the same sample preparation , the same species , and the same brain , we cannot identify a single , unique stiffness value that characterizes the brain’s stiffness . The brain’s white matter stiff - ness displays tremendous regional variations . To better understand the mechanistic origin of these variations was the main focus of this study . Fig . 7 . Stiffness - myelin relation in different regions of cerebral white matter . Color - coded dots indicate mean , gray ellipses indicate standard deviation in stiffness and myelin content . Stiffness increased withincreasing myelin content , from 0 . 72 kPaat a myelin content of 64 – 2 . 45 kPa at a myelin content of 89 % . Stiffness and myelin content were highly correlated with a Pearson correlation coefﬁcient of q ¼ 0 : 91 ( p < 0 . 01 ) .

Weickenmeier et al . / Acta Biomaterialia 42 ( 2016 ) 265 – 272 269 4 . 3 . Histological characterization Upon visual inspection of the samples in Fig . 5 , we did not observe signiﬁcant regional differences in white matter macrostructure that could explain our large stiffness variations . To analyze white matter microstructure , we performed combined hematoxylin and eosin and luxol fast blue staining [ 36 ] . Hema - toxylin colors cell nuclei in blue and a subsequent counterstaining with eosin colors eosinophilic intracellular and extracellular pro - tein structures in various shades of red , pink , and orange . Luxol fast blue is a sulfonated copper phthalocyanine dye that is attracted to the bases in the lipoproteins of the myelin sheath and colors them in blue whereas neuropil appears pink , and nerve cells appear pur - ple [ 37 ] . This combined staining allowed us to macrostructurally differentiate regions of gray and white matter , as highlighted in Fig . 6 ( a ) and ( b ) , and to microstructurally quantify the myelin con - tent of white matter tissue , as illustrated in Fig . 6 ( c ) – ( e ) . Upon image analysis , we recorded regional variations from 56 % to 81 % in the local myelin content of the cerebral white matter tissue . While the luxol fast blue stain can quantify the variation in myelin content , it cannot answer the question whether this variation is caused by a variation in the degree of myelination , by a variation in the axonal density , or both . 4 . 4 . White matter stiffness increases with myelin content Our measurements in Fig . 5 indicate a trend towards white mat - ter stiffening along the anterior - posterior arch . Yet , because of the current sample size , this regional stiffness gradient was not strong enough to be statistically signiﬁcant . However , our observed trend agrees well with ﬁndings reported in the literature for bovine brain [ 38 ] and human brain [ 39 ] . In particular the latter study describes a density gradient in the white matter myelin content from a lower myelin content in the anterior region to a higher myelin content in the posterior region [ 39 ] . This also agrees with recent magnetic resonance elastography studies that report a stiffness gradient along the anterior - posterior arch in different substructures of the brain [ 40 ] . Although we did not observe a well - deﬁned gradient in either stiffness or myelin content along the anterior - posterior arch , we found an explicit correlation between both parameters . Fig . 7 visualizes the relation between cerebral white matter stiff - ness and myelin content in the eight analyzed subregions high - lighted through the gray boxes in Fig . 5 . Our study suggests that the cerebral white matter stiffness and the local myelin content are highly correlated ; in our case , with a Pearson correlation coef - ﬁcient of q ¼ 0 : 91 ( p < 0 . 01 ) . These observations are in line with a recent study that reported a strong correlation between mechani - cal properties from atomic force microscopy and ultrastructure from immunohistochemistry [ 16 ] . 4 . 5 . Clinical implications Our ﬁndings indicate a clear correlation between white matter stiffness and myelin content . This correlation could have signiﬁ - cant clinical implications . During development , cortical folding occurs at a very low stiffness ratio between gray and white matter and takes place in parallel with the onset of myelination [ 34 ] . Several mathematical models have shown that the developing folding pattern is highly sensitive to the stiffness contrast between gray and white matter [ 41 ] , and that even small changes in stiff - ness could have a large effect on the emerging brain surface mor - phology [ 30 , 42 , 43 ] . Dysmyelination , the delayed or premature formation of myelin sheaths , could induce pathological softening or stiffening , which could compromise cortical folding and normal brain development . Developmental white matter diseases [ 44 ] are associated with psychological disorders such as schizophrenia , autism , and epilepsy [ 45 , 46 ] . Other myelin - based disorders are known to cause cerebellar ataxia , spasticity , and optic atrophy [ 47 ] . A typical example is hypomyelination , vanishing white mat - ter disease , which affects early myelinating structures in the brain . Our ﬁndings suggest that myelin - based alterations directly affect the stiffness of white matter tissue , and with it the mechanical environment of the brain . These changes directly impact our brain’s elasticity , viscoelasticity [ 48 ] , and poroelasticity [ 49 ] , which , in turn , could affect extracellular matrix turnover and immune cell inﬁltration [ 50 ] . Taken together , our study indicates that myelin not only performs a critical function in controlling the electrical environment of our brain , but also plays an important role in modulating its mechanical environment . 4 . 6 . Limitations Our current study has a few limitations that could point towards directions for future work . First , the study was performed on bovine brain , and it remains to be shown to what extent the results translate to human brain tissue . Second , we have assumed that the blue area fraction of the luxol fast blue stain is directly related to the local myelin content , which could be overly simplis - tic . Moreover , the luxol fast blue stain alone cannot answer whether variations in myelin content are caused by variations in the degree of myelination , variations in the axonal density , or both . In addition , we have only characterized tissue microstructure by means of the local myelin content , and have neglected all other cell types including oligodendrocytes , astrocytes , and microglia . We are currently performing a systematic analysis of different histological stains to explore to what extent other microstructural elements vary across the brain and contribute to shaping the mechanical environment . Third , it would be interesting to analyze brains of different ages to characterize the chronological evolution of stiffness and microstructure in the developing brain , both in time and space . Last , our study characterizes the correlation between stiffness and myelin content ex vivo and it remains to be shown whether this correlation is equally present in the living brain in vivo . In its in vivo state , white matter in the intact brain has been reported to be under tension along the ﬁber directions [ 32 ] . This residual stress would affect the apparent modulus of white matter . It is plausible , even likely , that the degree of tension is different in different regions of the brain [ 30 ] . The original slicing of brain tissue into 5 mm - thick slices is likely to relieve residual stress in a heterogeneous manner . While we expect our 5 mm - thick slices to preserve the biological state better than 5 mm - sized cubes , only true in vivo testing , e . g . , through magnetic resonance elastography [ 51 ] , will provide clariﬁcation to which extent the mechanical properties differ in live and dead brain tissue . 5 . Conclusion Although brain stiffness is broadly acknowledged to play an important role in neurophysiology and neuropathology , reliable stiffness measurements are sparse and reported values vary signif - icantly . Little is known about how the microstructural architecture of our brain affects its macrostructural response . Here we used a hybrid mechanical - histological approach to establish a direct cor - relation between white matter stiffness and microstructure . Speciﬁcally , we demonstrated that the local stiffness of white mat - ter tissue is highly correlated to the regional myelin content . In 116 indentation tests of six freshly harvested bovine brains , we found that cerebral white matter , with a stiffness of 1 . 33 ± 0 . 63 kPa , was almost twice as stiff as cerebral gray matter , with 0 . 68 ± 0 . 20 kPa , and also displayed a markedly larger regional 270 J . Weickenmeier et al . / Acta Biomaterialia 42 ( 2016 ) 265 – 272 variation . To explain this variation , we quantiﬁed the local myelin content using combined hematoxylin and eosin and luxol fast blue staining , and found that the white matter stiffness increased with increasing myelin content , from 0 . 5 kPa at a myelin content of 63 – 2 . 5 kPa at a myelin content of 92 % . Our results may have impli - cations in neurodevelopment and neurological disease . In develop - ment , incomplete myelination could help explain – at least in part – why immature brains are softer than myelinated , mature brains and more vulnerable to mechanical insult , for example , in shaken baby syndrome . In disease , the degree of brain softening could serve as a clinical marker to quantify the degree of demyeli - nation and characterize the onset of demyelinating disease , for example , in multiple sclerosis . Our study suggests that myelin not only plays an important function in insulating signal propaga - tion and improving electrical function of single axons , but also in providing structural support and mechanical stiffness to the brain as a whole .
