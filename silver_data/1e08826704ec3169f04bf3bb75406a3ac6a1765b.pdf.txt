Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 128231 Summary Dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is fundamental to a number of cell biological events . A variety of actin - regulatory proteins modulate polymerization and depolymerization of actin and contribute to actin cytoskeletal reorganization . Cyclase - associated protein ( CAP ) is a conserved actin - monomer - binding protein that has been studied for over 20 years . Early studies have shown that CAP sequesters actin monomers ; recent studies , however , have revealed more active roles of CAP in actin filament dynamics . CAP enhances the recharging of actin monomers with ATP antagonistically to ADF / cofilin , and also promotes the severing of actin filaments in cooperation with ADF / cofilin . Self - oligomerization and binding to other proteins regulate activities and localization of CAP . CAP has crucial roles in cell signaling , development , vesicle trafficking , cell migration and muscle sarcomere assembly . This Commentary discusses the recent advances in our understanding of the functions of CAP and its implications as an important regulator of actin cytoskeletal dynamics , which are involved in various cellular activities . Key words : Actin turnover , ADF / cofilin , Cyclase - associated protein , Nucleotide exchange , Severing Introduction The coordinated regulation of the assembly and disassembly of actin filaments enables spatially and temporally controlled dynamics of actin cytoskeletal structures within cells . The combined functions of a minimal set of actin - regulatory proteins for nucleation , depolymerization and capping can explain the basic mechanism of persistent actin filament turnover , for example , at the leading edge of motile cells or in the comet tails of bacterial pathogens ( Bugyi and Carlier , 2010 ; Pollard and Cooper , 2009 ) . However , the actin - cytoskeletal structures in different types of cell exhibit different patterns of dynamics that involve a number of additional actin - binding proteins . On the one hand , CAP has been described as an actin - monomer - binding protein that can sequester actin monomers and prevent them from polymerization in vitro ( Hubberstey and Mottillo , 2002 ) . On the other hand , genetic and cell biological studies of CAP in several organisms have suggested that CAP has important roles in the dynamic actin reorganization that cannot be simply explained by its actin - monomer - sequestering function ( Balcer et al . , 2003 ; Bertling et al . , 2004 ; Freeman and Field , 2000 ) . Recent studies have revealed new biochemical functions of CAP . It promotes actin filament dynamics ( Box 1 ) , closely cooperates with ADF / cofilin ( Box 2 ) in vitro and in vivo ( Moriyama and Yahara , 2002 ) , and self - oligomerization of CAP enhances its activities ( Quintero - Monzon et al . , 2009 ) . Furthermore , the conservation of CAPs among eukaryotes suggests that CAP is a fundamentally important actin regulator . This article covers biochemical and cell biological functions of CAPs with an emphasis on their roles in regulating the actin cytoskeleton . Sequence and structure of CAP Domain organization of CAP Depending on the species , CAP consists of 450 – 550 amino acids , and has several distinct motifs and domains ( Fig . 1A ) , which is discussed in this section . Most species have only a single CAP isoform , although vertebrates have two CAP isoforms , CAP1 and CAP2 . Parasitic protozoa only have the C - terminal sequence of CAP , the so - called C - CAPs ( Hliscs et al . , 2010 ) ( Fig . 1A ) . Isoforms and orthologs of CAP are discussed in the next section . The most N - terminal amino acids ( , 40 residues ) of CAP are predicted to form a coiled - coil ( Fig . 1A ) ; this region of yeast Srv2 / CAP is sufficient for binding to adenylyl cyclase , an enzyme that produces cAMP ( Nishida et al . , 1998 ) and is required for self - oligomerization of Srv2 / CAP ( Quintero - Monzon et al . , 2009 ) . However , this N - terminal region is unstructured in solution ( Mavoungou et al . , 2004 ) and coiled - coil formation has not been structurally demonstrated thus far . Therefore , a coiled - coil might form upon binding to adenylyl cyclase or self - oligomerization of CAP . Most of the N - terminal region is composed of a stable bundle of six antiparallel a - helices ( Fig . 1B ) that are termed helical folded domain ( HFD ) . Structural analyses show that the HFD forms a laterally associated anti - parallel dimer ( Ksiazek et al . , 2003 ; Yusof et al . , 2005 ) ( Fig . 1B , bottom ) . The HFD binds to the ADF / cofilin - G - actin complex ( Moriyama and Yahara , 2002 ; Quintero - Monzon et al . , 2009 ) and also interacts with ADF / cofilin - bound actin filaments to promote their severing ( Chaudhry et al . , 2013 ) ( Box 2 ) . In the central region of CAP , there are two proline - rich regions ( P1 and P2 ) ( Fig . 1A ) . P1 is highly conserved in CAPs from different species – with a stretch of , 10 proline residues , whereas P2 is less conserved – with an only scattered appearance Commentary 3249 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e of proline residues . Several interaction partners for CAP selectively bind to either P1 or P2 . For instance , profilin , an actin - monomer - binding protein , binds to P1 of yeast Srv2 / CAP ( Bertling et al . , 2007 ) and of mouse CAP1 ( Makkonen et al . , 2013 ) . The Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain of the tyrosine kinase Abl binds to the P1 of human CAP1 ( Freeman et al . , 1996 ) , that of the yeast actin - binding protein 1 ( ABP1 ) binds to P2 of yeast Srv2 / CAP ( Freeman et al . , 1996 ; Lila and Drubin , 1997 ) . Also located in the central region of CAP is a Wiscott Aldrich Syndrome protein homology 2 ( WH2 ) domain ( Fig . 1A ) ( Paunola et al . , 2002 ) . WH2 of yeast Srv2 / CAP binds to G - actin without exhibiting a strong preference for actin - bound nucleotides and has a crucial role in the nucleotide exchange of G - actin , as described below ( Chaudhry et al . , 2010 ) ( see Box 1 for the significance of nucleotides in actin dynamics ) . The C - terminal half of CAP is mostly composed of b - strands , which are arranged into six coils of right - handed b - helixes ( Dodatko et al . , 2004 ) ( Fig . 1C ) . The most C - terminal , 35 amino acids contain a dimerization motif , in which b - strands participate in a b - sheet of a second CAP molecule , resulting in a strand - exchanged dimer ( Fig . 1C , bottom ) . In addition , the C - terminal half of CAP contains a sequence motif that is present in a number of proteins , including tubulin - binding cofactor C and X - linked retinitis pigmentosa 2 protein ( RP2 ) ( Dodatko et al . , 2004 ) ; the homologous domains are currently termed CAPs and RP2 ( CARP ) domains in the Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool ( SMART ) database ( Schultz et al . , 1998 ) . The CARP domain of CAP binds to G - actin independently of the WH2 domain ( Chaudhry et al . , 2010 ; Makkonen et al . , 2013 ; Mattila et al . , 2004 ; Nomura and Ono , 2013 ) . CAP isoforms , orthologs and nomenclature CAPs have been identified in almost all representative eukaryotic species and are most probably present in all eukaryotes ( Fig . 2 ; supplementary material Table S1 ) . The domain structure of CAP is conserved among species . However , C - CAPs in protozoa only have the CARP domain and the dimerization motif ( Hliscs et al . , 2010 ) ( Fig . 1A ) . Leishmania and Trypanosoma C - CAPs have a proline - rich sequence at the N - terminus , but other C - CAPs do not ( Hliscs et al . , 2010 ) . Leishmania major has another long form of a CAP - related protein that contains the CARP domain ( Fig . 2 , see the atypical CAP in the phylogenetic tree ) and contains an N - terminal region that is not homologous to the HFD domain of CAPs ( Hliscs et al . , 2010 ) . Fungi , protists and many invertebrates only have one CAP gene ( Fig . 2 ) . However , multiple CAP isoforms are present in vertebrates , nematodes and green plants ( Fig . 2 ) . Vertebrates have two CAP isoforms , CAP1 and CAP2 ( Swiston et al . , 1995 ; Yu et al . , 1994 ) , which are , 60 % identical in their amino acid sequence and exhibit different expression patterns . In mammals , CAP1 is widely expressed – except in skeletal muscle , whereas CAP2 is predominantly expressed in brain , heart , skeletal muscle and testis ( Bertling et al . , 2004 ; Swiston et al . , 1995 ) . In particular , CAP2 has been shown to be a crucial regulator of sarcomere assembly in striated muscle ( heart and skeletal muscle ) , as discussed below . However , it is currently unknown whether CAP1 and CAP2 have different biochemical properties . Similarly , the nematode C . elegans has both a muscle - specific CAP ( CAS - 1 ) ( Nomura et al . , 2012 ) and a nonmuscle CAP ( CAS - 2 ) ( Nomura and Ono , 2013 ) . In addition , several CAP isoforms have been identified in several green plants ( Fig . 2 ; supplementary material Table S1 ) , but their functional differences have not been determined . Thus , other than the tissue - specific expression of CAP isoforms , their functional differences are not well understood . Multiple isoforms of other actin regulators , including ADF / cofilin ( Ono , 2007 ; Poukkula et al . , 2011 ) and profilin ( Jockusch et al . , 2007 ; Kovar et al . , 2000 ; Polet et al . , 2006 ) , are also expressed in these multicellular organisms , suggesting that specific isoforms of these actin regulators cooperate to modulate actin filament dynamics in a tissue - specific manner . Cyclase - associated protein is the original name for CAP . However , several alternative names have also been used . CAP was originally identified in budding yeast as an adenylyl - cyclase - associated protein ( Field et al . , 1990 ) and also as a suppressor of hyperactive RAS2 ( V19 ) , thus explaining the yeast name Srv2 ( Fedor - Chaiken et al . , 1990 ) . CAP and Srv2 are identical , and often designated as Srv2 / CAP . ASP - 56 has been isolated from pig platelets as an actin - monomer - binding protein , and partial peptide sequences have shown that ASP - 56 is porcine CAP1 ( Gieselmann and Mann , 1992 ) . Rat CAP1 was cloned as a mammalian CAP homolog 1 and originally named MCH1 ( Zelicof et al . , 1993 ) . A Drosophila CAP gene was identified Box 1 . Role of adenine nucleotides ( ATP and ADP ) in actin filament dynamics One actin molecule binds to one molecule of ATP or ADP , and the nucleotide status of actin strongly affects its properties in both polymerization and depolymerization . ATP - bound monomeric globular ( G - ) actin ( ATP – G - actin ) is more competent for polymerization than ADP – G - actin . Polymerized filamentous ( F - ) actin has two ends with different properties , the pointed ( minus ) and barbed ( plus ) ends . ATP – G - actin binds to the barbed end of F - actin with higher affinity than to the pointed end . When a concentration of ATP – G - actin falls below the dissociation constant for ATP – G - actin with the pointed end of F - actin , actin constantly depolymerizes from the pointed end and polymerizes at the barbed end without an apparent change in the ratio of G - and F - actin , which is called treadmilling . However , ADP – G - actin binds to pointed and barbed ends with nearly equal affinity , and therefore it does not undergo treadmilling . Furthermore , exchange of actin - bound nucleotide occurs primarily at G - actin , whereas hydrolysis of ATP into ADP occurs primarily at F - actin . The newly depolymerized actin monomers are predominantly bound by ADP . When free ATP is present , ADP – G - actin can ‘recharge’ itself by rapidly exchanging ADP for ATP and , thus , maintaining the treadmilling cycle . However , when no free ATP is available , ADP – G - actin cannot recharge itself , which prevents the treadmilling cycle . Box 2 . Actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin ADF / cofilin is an actin - regulatory protein that promotes the turnover of actin filaments . It binds to G - actin and F - actin in a molar ratio of 1 : 1 . ADF / cofilin severs F - actin and promotes dissociation of G - actin from filament ends . Because F - actin is stable , enhancement of F - actin disassembly by ADF / cofilin can supply a pool of G - actin for new rounds of actin polymerization and can promote persistent turnover of actin filaments . ADF / cofilin preferentially binds to an actin molecule bound by ADP and inhibits nucleotide exchange of G - actin . Several other actin regulatory proteins including CAP , profilin and AIP1 cooperate with ADF / cofilin in order to regulate the dynamics of actin filaments as shown in Fig . 3 .

C . elegans CAP genes were namend cas - 1 and cas - 2 ( Nomura et al . , 2012 ) , because ‘ cap ’ had already been used for genes that encode subunits of actin capping proteins ( Waddle et al . , 1993 ) . Apart from these exceptions , cyclase - associated protein or CAP is used as a common name for these proteins in most of the literature . Actin - regulatory functions of CAPs Conserved functions of CAPs as regulators of the actin cytoskeleton Although CAP was originally discovered as a component of the Ras – cAMP signaling pathway , studies of CAPs in various species suggest that this signaling function is specific to only a limited number of organisms ; but , instead , their cytoskeletal function appears to be conserved among eukaryotes ( Hubberstey and Mottillo , 2002 ) . Two unrelated phenotypes can be detected in Srv2 / CAP - deficient yeast cells : defective Ras – cAMP signaling and morphological abnormalities ( Fedor - Chaiken et al . , 1990 ; Field et al . , 1990 ) . These could be independently suppressed by the expression of an N - terminal half and a C - terminal half of Srv2 / CAP , respectively ( Gerst et al . , 1991 ) . The morphological abnormalities in Srv2 / CAP - deficient cells are associated with a lack of polarized actin distribution , the loss of normal actin cables and the formation of abnormal actin bundles ( Vojtek et al . , 1991 ) . Furthermore , the expression of a heterologous CAP from other species , e . g . fission yeast , in Srv2 / CAP - deficient budding yeast can suppress the actin - related phenotype but not the Ras - dependent phenotype , suggesting that the actin - regulatory function is evolutionarily conserved among CAPs ( Kawamukai et al . , 1992 ) . Similar genetic studies have demonstrated a conserved actin - regulatory function of CAPs from Lentinus edodes ( shiitake mushroom ) ( Zhou et al . , 1998 ) , rats ( Zelicof et al . , 1993 ) and humans ( Matviw et al . , 1992 ) . Thus , these genetic assays have provided solid evidence that CAPs are , indeed , conserved regulators of the actin cytoskeleton . Effects of CAP on G - actin – monomer sequestration and enhancement of nucleotide exchange Early biochemical studies on CAPs suggested that CAPs are actin - monomer sequestering proteins that prevent actin nucleation and elongation from filament ends ( Freeman et al . , 1995 ) . However , recent studies have revealed that CAPs fulfill more active roles in promoting the dynamics of actin filaments . Therefore , the interpretations of some early genetic and cell biology studies may need to be revised on the basis of these recently identified functions for CAPs in actin dynamics . CAP binds to G - actin at a molar ratio of 1 : 1 and inhibits the spontaneous actin polymerization of G - actin . This activity has been demonstrated for CAPs from budding yeast ( Freeman et al . , 1995 ) , Dictyostelium ( Gottwald et al . , 1996 ) , Arabidopsis ( Chaudhry et al . , 2007 ) , C . elegans ( CAS - 1 and CAS - 2 ) ( Nomura et al . , 2012 ; Nomura and Ono , 2013 ) , pig platelets ( ASP - 56 / CAP1 ) ( Gieselmann and Mann , 1992 ) , humans ( CAP2 ) ( Peche et al . , 2013 ) and Cryptosporidium ( C - CAP ) ( Hliscs et al . , 2010 ) . The effect of CAP on actin elongation is somewhat controversial ; Freeman et al . ( Freeman et al . , 1995 ) reported that yeast Srv2 / CAP inhibits the incorporation of G - actin to either pointed or barbed ends of actin filaments , whereas Mattila et al . ( Mattila et al . , 2004 ) reported that yeast Srv2 / CAP specifically inhibits the incorporation of G - actin to the barbed end . This discrepancy might be owing to different ratios of Srv2 / CAP to G - actin used in these studies , because it was shown that human CAP1 accelerates the addition of G - actin to barbed ends when it is present in sub - stoichiometric amounts compared with G - actin , but inhibits monomer addition when CAP1 and G - actin are used at stoichiometric amounts ( Moriyama and Yahara , 2002 ) . At the steady state , CAP sequesters G - actin when it is present in a concentration that is equimolar to that of G - actin . As the cellular concentration of CAPs has not been determined , it is unclear whether CAP is present in cells at a concentration that is sufficient to contribute to sequestration of G - actin , which is generally maintained at a high level of 30 , 50 % of total actin in non - muscle cells ( Heacock and Bamburg , 1983 ) . CAPs localize to actin patches in yeast ( Lila and Drubin , 1997 ) and to the leading edges of motile Dictyostelium ( Gottwald et al . , 1996 ) and mammalian cells ( Freeman and Field , 2000 ; Zelicof et al . , 1996 ) . Therefore , the local concentration of CAP could be sufficiently WASP homology 2 N C HFD Coiled coil CARP domain Dimerization motif N C CAP C - CAP P1 P2 Adenylyl cyclase Profilin F - actin : severing G - actin : monomer sequestration nucleotide exchange F - actin : severing G - actin : monomer sequestration nucleotide exchange Abl ABP1 A B HFD C CARP domain C N C N C N C N C N C N Proline rich Fig . 1 .

However , it remains unclear whether the actin - monomer sequestering function of CAP is indeed important in vivo . CAP also enhances the rate of exchange of G - actin - bound nucleotides ( Fig . 3 ) , which might be its most important actin - regulatory effect . During the ‘actin treadmilling’ cycle , the constant recharging of G - actin with ATP and ATP hydrolysis by F - actin drive the biased depolymerization of ADP – G - actin from the pointed end of the actin filament and the polymerization of ATP – G - actin from the barbed end ( Bugyi and Carlier , 2010 ; De La Cruz and Pollard , 2001 ; Kinosian et al . , 1993 ; Pollard , 1986 ; Pollard et al . , 1992 ) ( Box 1 ) . However , several G - actin - binding proteins , including thymosin b 4 ( Goldschmidt - Clermont et al . , 1992 ) and ADF / cofilin ( Nishida , 1985 ) inhibit this nucleotide exchange and , therefore , prevent this ‘recharging’ process . Profilin catalytically promotes the nucleotide exchange at G - actin ( Goldschmidt - Clermont et al . , 1991 ; Mockrin and Korn , 1980 ; Nishida , 1985 ) ( Fig . 3 ) and , therefore , enhances actin turnover in the presence of thymosin b 4 ( Carlier et al . , 1993 ; Pantaloni and Carlier , 1993 ) or ADF / cofilin ( Blanchoin and Pollard , 1998 ; Didry et al . , 1998 ) . Similarly , CAP is capable of enhancing nucleotide exchange of G - actin and , thus , actin turnover in the presence of ADF / cofilin ( Balcer et al . , 2003 ; Chaudhry et al . , 2007 ; Moriyama and Yahara , 2002 ; Nomura et al . , 2012 ; Quintero - Monzon et al . , 2009 ) ( Fig . 3 ) . Such a functional similarity between CAP and profilin was suggested by an early study that showed that the cytoskeletal phenotypes of Srv2 / CAP - deficient yeast cells can be suppressed by overexpression of profilin ( Vojtek et al . , 1991 ) . However , in plants and algae , profilins lack this nucleotide – exchange activity Amino acid substitutions per 100 residues 0 358 . 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 Mus musculus CAP1 ( mouse / mammal ) Rat tus norvegicus CAP1 ( rat / mammal ) Homo sapiens CAP1 ( human / mammal ) Anolis carolinensis CAP1 ( lizard / reptile ) Gallus gallus CAP1 ( chicken / bird ) Xenopus laevis CAP1a ( frog / amphibian ) Xenopus laevis CAP1b ( frog / amphibian ) Mus musculus CAP2 ( mouse / mammal ) Rat tus norvegicus CAP2 ( rat / mammal ) Homo sapiens CAP2 ( human / mammal ) Anolis carolinensis CAP2 ( lizard / reptile ) Gallus gallus CAP2 ( chicken / bird ) Xenopus laevis CAP2 ( frog / amphibian ) Danio rerio CAP2 ( fish ) Danio rerio CAP1 ( fish ) Ixodes scapularis CAP ( tick / arthropod ) Caenorhabditis elegans CAS - 2 ( nematode ) Caenorhabditis elegans CAS - 1 ( nematode ) Drosophila melanogaster Capulet / Act up ( insect / arthropod ) Crassostrea gigas CAP ( oyster / mollusc ) Branchiostoma floridae CAP ( amphioxus / Cepharochordata ) Capitella teleta CAP ( polychete worm / annelid ) Dictyostelium fasciculatum CAP ( slime mold ) Polysphondylium pallidum CAP ( slime mold ) Dictyostelium discoideum CAP ( slime mold ) Acanthamoeba castellanii CAP ( amoeba ) Entamoeba histolytica CAP ( amoeba ) Aspergillus nidulans CAP ( mold ) Lentinula edodes CAP ( mushroom ) Schizosaccharomyces pombe CAP ( fission yeast ) Candida albicans CAP ( infectious yeast ) Saccharomyces cerevisiae Srv2 / CAP ( budding yeast ) Hydra viridissima CAP ( hydra / hydrozoa ) Strongylocentrotus purpuratus CAP ( sea urchin / echinoderm ) Ciona intestinalis CAP ( ascidian / Urochordata ) Oryza sativa CAP1 ( rice / plant ) Oryza sativa CAP3 ( rice / plant ) Oryza sativa CAP4 ( rice / plant ) Zea mays CAP1 ( corn / plant ) Arabidopsis thaliana CAP1 ( rockcress / plant ) Gossypium hirsutum CAP ( cotton / plant ) Zea mays CAP2 ( corn / plant ) Oryza sativa CAP2 ( rice / plant ) Chlorella variabilis CAP ( green algae ) Cryptosporidium parvum C - CAP ( protozoa ) Toxoplasma gondii C - CAP ( protozoa ) Plasmodium falciparum C - CAP ( protozoa ) Trypanosoma cruzi C - CAP2 ( protozoa ) Trypanosoma cruzi C - CAP ( protozoa ) Leishmania major C - CAP ( protozoa ) Leishmania major CAP ( protozoa ) Danio rerio CAP1 ( fish ) ( ) ( ) Vertebrate CAP1 Vertebrate CAP2 Invertebrate CAP Fungal CAP Protist CAP Invertebrate CAP Plant / algal CAP Protozoan C - CAP Protozoan atypical CAP Fig . 2 .

However , unlike profilin , which preferentially binds to ATP – G - actin ( Pantaloni and Carlier , 1993 ) , CAP binds to ADP – G - actin with a relatively high affinity and effectively competes with ADF / cofilin for binding to ADP – G - actin ( Mattila et al . , 2004 ; Moriyama and Yahara , 2002 ) . Yeast profilin has a much weaker nucleotide - exchange activity than mammalian profilin ( Eads et al . , 1998 ; Wen et al . , 2008 ) and fails to enhance nucleotide exchange when ADF / cofilin is bound to ADP – G - actin ( Chaudhry et al . , 2010 ) . Thus , a sequential processing mechanism of actin monomers by CAP ( for ADP / ATP exchange ) and profilin ( for the incorporation of ATP – G - actin to actin barbed - ends ) has been proposed in yeast ( Mattila et al . , 2004 ) . In addition , profilin binds to P1 of Srv2 / CAP and collaborates in polarized actin localization in yeast ( Bertling et al . , 2007 ) ( Fig . 3 ) . However , the functional relationship between CAP and profilin is not well understood in other organisms . For instance , mammalian profilin enhances the nucleotide exchange of G - actin to much faster rates than yeast profilin ( Wen et al . , 2008 ) , but it is unclear whether profilin and CAP function in a redundant or hierarchical manner to regulate actin turnover in mammalian cells . In human CAP1 and yeast Srv2 / CAP , HFD in the N - terminal half of CAP binds to the ADF / cofilin - actin complex ( Fig . 3 ) and augments the ADF / cofilin - mediated turnover of actin filaments ( Moriyama and Yahara , 2002 ; Quintero - Monzon et al . , 2009 ) . These results were originally interpreted as evidence for an active involvement of HFD in the dissociation of the ADF / cofilin - actin complex . However , a recent study shows that HFD is not required for the recycling of ADF / cofilin and G - actin but , instead , has a separate function in actin filament severing ( Chaudhry et al . , 2013 ) , which is discussed below . The sites necessary for monomer sequestering and nucleotide exchange activities of CAP reside in its C - terminal half that contains WH2 and CARP ( Fig . 1A ) . The C - terminal half of CAP can bind to one molecule of G - actin ( Freeman et al . , 1995 ) , and WH2 and CARP bind independently to G - actin ( Chaudhry et al . , 2010 ; Makkonen et al . , 2013 ; Mattila et al . , 2004 ; Peche et al . , 2013 ) , suggesting that they separately contact G - actin . An N - terminal part of WH2 from other proteins , such as WASP , was found to bind to G - actin at a cleft between its subdomains 1 and 3 ( Dominguez , 2007 ) , and WH2 of CAP might bind to G - actin in a similar manner . Although a CARP - binding site on G - actin has not been determined , mutations in its subdomains 2 and 4 – which are the candidate sites for CARP binding – disrupt its interaction with Srv2 / CAP in yeast ( Amberg et al . , 1995 ) . Although the CARP domain is sufficient to promote the nucleotide exchange of ADP – G - actin ( Makkonen et al . , 2013 ) , WH2 is necessary to facilitate nucleotide exchange when ADF / cofilin is bound to ADP – G - actin ( Chaudhry et al . , 2010 ; Nomura and Ono , 2013 ) . Since ADF / cofilin and WH2 share the same binding site on G - actin ( Dominguez and Holmes , 2011 ) , WH2 might be needed for CAP to be able to compete with ADF / cofilin for G - actin binding . Nonetheless , the structural basis for the acceleration of the nucleotide exchange of G - actin by CAP is largely unknown . Effects of CAP on F - actin – enhancement of filament severing CAP also directly interacts with actin filaments and enhances filament disassembly ( Moriyama and Yahara , 2002 ) . Recent microscopic observations have clearly demonstrated that CAP induces the severing of actin filaments ( Fig . 3 ) ( Chaudhry et al . , 2013 ; Normoyle and Brieher , 2012 ) . Mammalian CAP1 alone can sever actin filaments at an acidic pH but not at neutral pH ( Normoyle and Brieher , 2012 ) , whereas mammalian and avian ADF / cofilins efficiently sever actin filaments at basic pH but not at neutral and acidic pHs ( Hawkins et al . , 1993 ; Hayden et al . , 1993 ; Yonezawa et al . , 1985 ) . However , when CAP1 and ADF / cofilin are combined , they promote severing of actin filaments within a wide pH range ( Normoyle and Brieher , 2012 ) . Thus , either CAP1 or ADF / cofilin alone might function as a pH - dependent F - actin disassembly factor , but CAP1 and ADF / cofilin might act together as pH - independent F - actin disassembly factors . Yeast Srv2 / CAP also promotes the severing of ADF / cofilin - bound actin filaments and this activity is mediated by the N - terminal half of Srv2 / CAP that contains the coiled - coil region and the HFD ( Chaudhry et al . , 2013 ) . This activity of CAP resembles that of actin - interacting protein 1 ( AIP1 ) , which promotes the severing and disassembly of ADF / cofilin - bound actin filaments ( Ono , 2003 ) ( Fig . 3 ) . Indeed , a genetic study in yeast suggests redundant functions of the N - terminal half of Srv2 / CAP and AIP1 ( Chaudhry et al . , 2013 ) . However , the mechanism of how actin filaments are severed by the HFD of CAP still remains unclear . Functionally important surface residues in HFD of yeast Srv2 / CAP have been mapped to the surface of the HDF protein , opposite to the location of its N - and C - termini .

Regulation of actin filament dynamics by CAP , ADF / cofilin , profilin and AIP1 . CAP competes with ADF / cofilin for binding to G - actin ( right ) and promotes its nucleotide exchange ( top ) . CAP also promotes severing of ADF / cofilin - bound actin filaments ( bottom ) . These activities are similar to those exerted by profilin and AIP1 . ADF / cofilin cooperatively binds to actin filaments and severs them at the boundary between ADF / cofilin - bound and the bare segments ( Elam et al . , 2013 ) . Note that the molecular organization of the CAP oligomer is hypothetical . Also note that CAP binds to actin monomers in an oligomeric form but , for simplicity , only a monomeric CAP is shown as a G - actin - bound form . Cyclase - associated protein 3253 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e ( Quintero - Monzon et al . , 2009 ) ( Fig . 1B ) , but how these residues interact with ADF / cofilin - bound F - actin is unknown . In mammalian CAP2 , the WH2 domain is sufficient to sever actin filaments in the absence of ADF / cofilin at a neutral pH ( Peche et al . , 2013 ) , but its requirement for filament severing in the context of full - length CAP2 still needs to be determined . Oligomerization of CAP and its effect on actin regulation Both native and recombinant forms of CAP dimerize or oligomerize , and oligomerization of CAP has been implicated in its function to regulate actin . In yeast cells , Srv2 / CAP ( 55 kDa ) and actin ( 42 kDa ) form a high - molecular - mass complex of , 600 kDa ( Balcer et al . , 2003 ; Yang et al . , 1999 ) that contains six Srv2 / CAP and six actin molecules ( Balcer et al . , 2003 ; Quintero - Monzon et al . , 2009 ) . Mammalian CAP1 is also always tightly associated with actin monomers in tissues or cells that need to be dissociated using urea when CAP1 is to be purified ( Gieselmann and Mann , 1992 ; Moriyama and Yahara , 2002 ; Normoyle and Brieher , 2012 ) , which suggests that the formation of a high - molecular - mass CAP - actin complex is a conserved feature . CAP can also dimerize or oligomerize in the absence of actin and , as mentioned above , three separate regions are known to mediate self - association : the N - terminal coiled - coil region ( Quintero - Monzon et al . , 2009 ; Yu et al . , 1999 ) , the HFD ( Ksiazek et al . , 2003 ; Yusof et al . , 2005 ; Yusof et al . , 2006 ) ( Fig . 1B ) and the C - terminal dimerization motif ( Dodatko et al . , 2004 ) ( Fig . 1C ) . Furthermore , a study , in which short CAP fragments where used , suggests that the N - terminal part of CAP can bind to both the N - terminal and C - terminal sections of a second CAP ( Hubberstey et al . , 1996 ) . A mutational study of Dictyostelium CAP suggests that several configurations of a CAP dimer are possible ( Yusof et al . , 2006 ) . Therefore , a high number of CAP oligomer arrangements are possible , but the actual molecular architecture of the physiological CAP oligomer and CAP - actin complex is currently unknown . Nonetheless , disruption of CAP oligomerization through mutation of its N - terminal coiled - coil region impairs the activity of CAP to promote the disassembly of ADF / cofilin - bound actin filaments ( Chaudhry et al . , 2013 ; Quintero - Monzon et al . , 2009 ) and deletion of its C - terminal dimerization motif weakens its binding to actin ( Zelicof et al . , 1996 ) . Thus , oligomerization of CAP enhances its function to regulate actin to some extent , but the structure - function relationship of CAP oligomers and their activities still remains be elucidated . The Srv2 / CAP - actin complex purified from yeast cells has distinct structural features that suggest a highly ordered assembly of CAP molecules within the complex . Its analysis by electron microscopy shows that there are at least four small lobes in the core and two large peripheral lobes ( Balcer et al . , 2003 ) , but these structural features could not be correlated with the molecular domains of Srv2 and actin . The purified N - terminal section of yeast Srv2 / CAP , which contains the coiled - coil region and the HFD that can sever ADF / cofilin - bound actin filaments , oligomerizes into a hexamer . The latter has a radial pattern composed of six blade - like structures that resemble a wheel - type ‘shuriken’ , a throwing weapon used by Japanese Ninja ( Chaudhry et al . , 2013 ) . However , when the coiled - coil region , which mediates its oligomerization , is absent , HFD alone only has a considerably weaker severing activity , suggesting that CAP oligomerization enhances its activity . Thus , additional structural and functional information for CAP oligomers are required before we fully understand how CAP oligomerization promotes its activities . Function of CAP as a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton in vivo A link between cellular signaling and the actin cytoskeleton As noted above , the N - and C - termini of Srv2 / CAP independently regulate the Ras – cAMP signalling pathway and the actin cytoskeleton in yeast , respectively , and link these two mechanisms ( Freeman et al . , 1995 ; Gerst et al . , 1991 ; Mintzer and Field , 1994 ) . Srv2 / CAP mediates the recruitment of Ras and adenylyl cyclase to actin filaments . Interestingly , actin - anchored Ras is an active GTP - bound form and stimulates the production of cAMP , which results in the production of reactive oxygen species and is followed by apoptosis ( Gourlay and Ayscough , 2006 ) . The function of CAP as a link between adenylyl cyclase and actin has also been shown in other fungi such as Candida albicans ( Wang et al . , 2010 ; Zou et al . , 2010 ) and Magnaporthe oryzae ( a rice pathogen ) ( Zhou et al . , 2012 ) . In Dictyostelium , although a direct binding between adenylyl cyclase and CAP has not been detected , CAP also regulates both intracellular cAMP signaling and chemotactic behaviors , and potentially links these two mechanisms ( Noegel et al . , 2004 ; Noegel et al . , 1999 ; Sultana et al . , 2009 ; Sultana et al . , 2012 ) . However , it is unknown whether CAP is involved in cAMP signaling in animal cells . As mentioned above , CAP also binds to the SH3 domain of the Abl tyrosine kinase with its proline - rich P1 region ( Freeman et al . , 1996 ) . In Drosophila neuronal development , CAP ( Capulet / Act up ) and Abl together restrict the midline crossing of axons , suggesting that CAP and Abl are part of a complex that links the growth - cone - repellent signal to changes in the actin filament dynamics ( Wills et al . , 2002 ) . It has been shown that rat CAP1 is enriched in the neuronal growth cones ( Lu et al . , 2011 ; Nozumi et al . , 2009 ) , suggesting that CAP is a conserved regulator of neuronal growth . Mutations in Drosophila CAP also disturb oocyte polarity ( Baum et al . , 2000 ) , epithelial cell polarity ( Baum and Perrimon , 2001 ) , Hedgehog signaling ( Benlali et al . , 2000 ) , Hippo signaling ( Ferna´ndez et al . , 2011 ) and eye development ( Benlali et al . , 2000 ; Lin et al . , 2012 ) . However , it is not clear whether these phenotypic changes are owing to the direct role of CAP in certain signaling pathways or because of secondary effects of disorganized actin filaments . CAP - mutant Drosophila cells accumulate excessive actin filaments that arise owing of impaired actin monomer sequestration ( Baum and Perrimon , 2001 ; Benlali et al . , 2000 ) . However , a study in Drosophila neuronal dendrites shows that cofilin ( Twinstar ) localizes to accumulated actin filaments in CAP - null cells ( Medina et al . , 2008 ) in a manner similar to that in mammalian cofilin within CAP1 - depleted cells ( Bertling et al . , 2004 ) , suggesting a role of CAP in the correct localization of ADF / cofilin . Therefore , revisiting some of previously characterized CAP - mutant phenotypes in Drosophila in the context of actin filament turnover might reveal in vivo functions of CAP that have not previously been described . CAP in cell migration , cytokinesis and cancer CAP has been implicated in both cell migration and cytokinesis , but its precise role in these processes is not understood . As noted above , CAP is enriched in actin - rich lamellipodia of migrating cells , both in Dictyostelium ( Gottwald et al . , 1996 ; Noegel et al . , 1999 ) and cultured mammalian cells ( Bertling et al . , 2004 ; Journal of Cell Science 126 ( 15 ) 3254 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e Freeman and Field , 2000 ; Moriyama and Yahara , 2002 ; Zelicof et al . , 1996 ) . The localization of CAP to the leading edge of the cell is mediated through its N - terminal part in an unknown mechanism ( Freeman and Field , 2000 ; Moriyama and Yahara , 2002 ; Noegel et al . , 1999 ) . Knockdown of CAP strongly inhibits the formation of lamellipodia in Drosophila S2 cells ( Rogers et al . , 2003 ) . Knockdown of CAP also reduces the rate of cell migration in Dictyostelium ( Noegel et al . , 1999 ) and cultured mammalian cells ( Bertling et al . , 2004 ; Yamazaki et al . , 2009 ) . These reports suggest that CAP enhances lamellipodial protrusion by promoting actin filament dynamics during cell migration . However , CAP also localizes to the posterior cortex of migrating Dictyostelium cells ( Noegel et al . , 1999 ) and promotes the formation of stress fibers in mammalian fibroblasts ( Freeman and Field , 2000 ) , suggesting that it has roles in different aspects of actin dynamics within motile cells ; but how exactly it regulates cell migration is still not fully understood . Reduction of CAP protein levels in Dictyostelium leads to an increased number of multinucleated cells , suggestive of a cytokinesis defect ( Noegel et al . , 1999 ) . However , localization of CAP to cleavage furrows or other cytokinetic structures has not been reported . Deletion of the CAP gene in budding yeast or fission yeast causes growth defects at a high temperature or under certain nutrient conditions ( Fedor - Chaiken et al . , 1990 ; Field et al . , 1990 ; Kawamukai et al . , 1992 ) , but it is unknown whether these are caused by cytokinesis defects . Cell migration and cytokinesis are aberrantly regulated in cancer cells . Mammalian CAP isoforms are overexpressed in several types of cancer , suggesting a correlation between increased levels of CAP and occurrence of cancer phenotypes . For instance , CAP1 is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer ( Yamazaki et al . , 2009 ) and breast cancer ( Patsialou et al . , 2012 ) , and CAP2 has been found to be overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma ( Effendi et al . , 2013 ; Shibata et al . , 2006 ) . Therefore , if a functional correlation between CAP levels and cancer phenotypes can be established , CAP might serve as a diagnostic marker or therapeutic target for certain types of cancer . In addition , a recent study has shown that CAP1 interacts with the tumor suppressor BRCA1 - associated RING domain 1 ( BARD1 ) ( Woods et al . , 2012 ) , further suggesting an involvement of CAP1 in tumorigenesis . However , the functional significance of this interaction is unknown . Sarcomere organization in striated muscle In nematodes and vertebrates , one of the two CAP isoforms is predominantly expressed in striated muscle and has an essential role in the assembly of sarcomeres – the basic contractile units . For example , vertebrate CAP2 is expressed at high levels in certain tissues , including skeletal and cardiac muscles of mammals ( Bertling et al . , 2004 ; Peche et al . , 2007 ; Swiston et al . , 1995 ) , frogs ( Xenopus ) ( Wolanski et al . , 2009 ) , and zebrafish ( Effendi et al . , 2013 ) . Interestingly , the expression of mouse CAP2 is prominently induced during in vitro differentiation of embryonic stem cells into cardiomyocytes , indicating that CAP2 is a marker for cardiac development ( Christoforou et al . , 2008 ; Terami et al . , 2007 ) . In mammalian skeletal and cardiac muscles , CAP2 is localized in the nucleus and diffused in the cytoplasm in skeletal myoblasts and embryonic cardiomyocytes , whereas , in differentiated skeletal myotubes and cardiomyocytes , it localizes to the M - lines , which are at the center of the thick filaments ( Peche et al . , 2007 ) . CAP2 - null mice die earlier than wild - type mice and show a phenotype that is typically associated with dilated cardiomyopathy , including enlarged heart with dilated ventricle and atrium , increased fibrosis , and impaired heart function ( Peche et al . , 2013 ; Jeffrey Field , University of Pennsylvania , personal communication ) . Furthermore , the myofibrils in skeletal and cardiac muscles from CAP2 - null mice are disorganized with disturbed M - lines , thin filaments and Z - discs ( Peche et al . , 2013 ) . Thus , although it is clear that mammalian CAP2 is important for sarcomere organization in striated muscle , the mechanism by which it localizes to the M - line , and its significance , as well as its role in the regulation of sarcomeric actin filaments are not understood . The human CAP2 gene ( CAP2 ) is located at the chromosome region 6p22 . 3 , and deletions at this region cause several clinical phenotypes including heart defects ( Bremer et al . , 2009 ) . Therefore , molecular genetics approaches that target human CAP2 might reveal specific genetic lesions that are associated with heart diseases . In the nematode C . elegans , the CAP isoform CAS - 1 is predominantly expressed in striated muscle and localizes to the M - lines , where it is required for sarcomeric actin organization ( Nomura et al . , 2012 ) . CAS - 1 - null worms are homozygous lethal at late embryonic to early larval stages and exhibit severe disorganization of muscle actin filaments with formation of actin aggregates ( Nomura et al . , 2012 ) . In CAS - 1 - null worms , the muscle - specific ADF / cofilin UNC - 60B is mislocalized to these actin aggregates . UNC - 60B is also a crucial regulator of sarcomeric actin organization ( Ono et al . , 2003 ; Ono et al . , 1999 ) , and its mislocalization in CAS - 1 - null muscle strongly suggests that CAS - 1 is required for correct function of UNC - 60B . Thus , the genetic studies in C . elegans provide evidence that CAS - 1 cooperates with UNC - 60B to promote sarcomere organization in striated muscle . Thus , CAP is a conserved regulator of sarcomere organization . Sarcomeric actin filaments in striated muscle requires a dynamic regulation of actin assembly and disassembly to maintain myofibril integrity ( Ono , 2010 ) . The presence of a set of muscle - specific regulators of actin dynamics suggests that the assembly and maintenance of sarcomeres require a specific actin - regulatory mechanism . Mammalian cofilin - 2 is a muscle - specific ADF / cofilin ( Ono et al . , 1994 ; Vartiainen et al . , 2002 ) . Mutations in human cofilin - 2 ( CFL2 ) cause nemaline myopathy ( Agrawal et al . , 2007 ) , and cofilin - 2 - null mice show impaired maintenance of myofibrils in skeletal muscle ( Agrawal et al . , 2012 ) . Therefore , it will be interesting to determine whether cofilin - 2 and CAP2 specifically cooperate to regulate sarcomere assembly in mammalian muscle . Plant development In plants , CAP is the only known enhancer of G - actin nucleotide exchange , because plant profilins do not possess this functionality ( Chaudhry et al . , 2007 ) . Overexpression of Arabidopsis CAP1 causes a reduction in the size and number of cells , resulting in smaller leaves and petioles ( Barrero et al . , 2002 ) . However , overexpression of Arabidopsis CAP1 in tobacco plants leads to a reduced organ size that is primarily due to reduced size but not number of cells ( Barrero et al . , 2003 ) . In addition , CAP1 - null mutations in Arabidopsis cause a number of developmental defects , including reduced statue and reduced elongation of pollen tubes and root hairs ( Deeks et al . , 2007 ) , and actin bundle organization is disrupted in root hairs and epidermis . The CAP1 - null mutation and mutations in the Arp2 / 3 complex pathway synergistically enhance morphological defects , suggesting that CAP1 is actively involved in the Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin Cyclase - associated protein 3255 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e regulation , or that CAP1 and Arp2 / 3 are involved in the same process ( Deeks et al . , 2007 ) . Plants have multiple CAP isoforms , but their functional differences have not been elucidated . Other biological functions of CAPs CAP also has other functions , such as in endocytosis or Drosophila development , as discussed in earlier reviews ( Hubberstey and Mottillo , 2002 ; Stevenson and Theurkauf , 2000 ) . More recently , it has been shown that CAP is essential for the correct functioning of the endo - lysosomal system in Dictyostelium ( Sultana et al . , 2005 ) , suggesting that CAP is widely involved in membrane trafficking . In addition , upon induction of apoptosis , mammalian CAP1 translocates to the mitochondria where it further promotes the execution of apoptosis ( Wang et al . , 2008 ) . It is worth noting that cofilin also translocates to the mitochondria and promotes apoptosis ( Chua et al . , 2003 ) , suggesting that CAP1 and cofilin are pro - apoptotic proteins , although it remains unclear how exactly they promote apoptosis . Intriguingly , CAP1 has been identified as an autoantigen in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( Frampton et al . , 2000 ) and rheumatoid arthritis ( Kinloch et al . , 2005 ) , suggesting that CAP1 also has an extracellular function . Conclusions Recent studies have revealed that CAP exerts active roles in promoting actin filament dynamics . The wide distribution of CAPs in different cell types and organisms suggest that CAPs are common regulators of actin dynamics ; thus , they are expected to be involved in many diverse processes that require actin reorganization ( Fig . 4 ) . Some high - throughput studies have provided hints for these , so far not described , functions of CAPs . For example , upregulation of CAP1 has been reported in the brains of schizophrenic patients ( Martins - de - Souza et al . , 2010 ) and in macrophages treated with the anti - tumor agent lapachol ( Oliveira et al . , 2012 ) , suggesting that CAP1 - mediated actin reorganization is induced under these conditions . Despite the fact that several proteins are known to bind to CAP ( Fig . 1 ) , the mechanisms , by which CAP activity is regulated , are poorly understood . Mouse CAP1 is phosphorylated ( Guo - Lei Zhou , Arkansas State University , and Jeffrey Field , University of Pennsylvania , personal communication ) , suggesting that activity and localization of CAP can be regulated through kinase signaling pathways . CAP1 is also an intracellular substrate of a matrix metalloproteinase ( Cauwe et al . , 2008 ) , indicating that the protein level of CAP is controlled by proteolysis . It is also important to better understand the functional relationship between CAP and other actin - regulatory proteins . CAP can participate in both assembly and disassembly of actin filaments , and other actin - regulatory proteins may affect how CAP controls actin dynamics . Thus , further studies on CAPs are most likely to reveal a greater complexity of the regulatory mechanism that governs actin filament dynamics .
