Johannesson r Journal of Health Economics 19 2000 1007 – 1026 1008 concentration index as the measure of inequality . Their results showed that the inequalities in health significantly favoured the higher income groups in all (cid:14) . countries van Doorslaer et al . , 1997 . Self assessed overall health status was used (cid:14) . as the measure of health in the study by van Doorslaer et al . 1997 . Health status is , however , an incomplete measure of health since it ignores the length of life . It would thus also be interesting to investigate income - related inequalities with respect to length of life . That there is an association between income and mortality (cid:14) has been shown in many studies Lutter and Morrall , 1994 ; Viscusi , 1994a , b ; . Keeney , 1997 . Several previous studies have focused on inequalities in mortality (cid:14) . Le Grand , 1987 , 1989 ; Kunst and Mackenbach , 1992 , 1994 ; Valkonen , 1989 , but they have not measured the concentration index of income - related inequality . Ideally , one would like to use a health measure that incorporates both health status and length of life in one measure . Such a health measure , quality - adjusted (cid:14) . life - years QALYs , has been developed in the field of economic evaluation of (cid:14) . health care Drummond et al . , 1997 . QALYs are constructed by weighing (cid:14) . (cid:14) . life - years between 0 dead and 1 full health depending on the health status . (cid:14) . Williams 1997 estimated the number of QALYs in different social classes in the UK , but did not estimate a concentration index . A related health measure , health expectancy , has also been used to assess the difference in health between social (cid:14) . classes Bone et al . , 1995 . QALYs have , however , not yet been used in studies (cid:14) . 1 using the concentration index approach of van Doorslaer et al . 1997 . The purpose of this study is twofold . The first purpose is to develop methods for using life - years and QALYs as the health measure in studies of income - related inequalities in health . The second purpose is to report empirical results for Sweden . Our methods are described below in Section 2 , followed by a presenta - tion of the results in Section 3 . The paper ends with some concluding remarks in Section 4 . 2 . Methods 2 . 1 . Income - related inequality in life - years To estimate how the remaining life expectancy varies with income , we use data (cid:14) . (cid:14) from Statistic Sweden’s Survey of Living Conditions the ULF survey Statistics . Sweden , 1997 which have been linked to survival data from the National Causes of Death Statistics and to income data from the National Income Tax Statistics . Every year , Statistics Sweden conducts systematic surveys of living conditions , in 1 (cid:14) . Gerdtham et al . 1999 calculated health concentration indices for QALY weights as a measure of health status , but did not estimate concentration indices for QALYs . ( ) U . - G . Gerdtham , M . Johannesson r Journal of Health Economics 19 2000 1007 – 1026 1009 the form of one - hour personal interviews with randomly selected adults aged 16 – 84 years . Since 1975 , about 7000 individuals have been interviewed each year . We use pooled data from the annual interviews conducted in 1980 – 1986 for all the subjects aged 20 – 84 years at the time of the interview . We exclude subjects younger than 20 years of age , to avoid having subjects who are still in high school (cid:14) . most people in Sweden finish high school when they are 19 . The total sample consists of 43 , 898 individuals . After correcting for missing values , the sample is reduced to 43 , 366 individuals . The mortality experience of the sample is recorded until December 31 , 1996 . Table 1 gives summary statistics for the variables we use in the regression analysis . A Cox proportional hazard regression is estimated on the relationship between (cid:14) . mortality and income , controlling for age and gender Cox , 1972 . The dependent variable is the survival time in years and the survival status at the end of follow - up . The date of death is recorded for all subjects who have died by December 31 , 1996 . The survival time is estimated as the number of years from the interview date to the date of death . The censored survival time of persons alive at the end of 1996 is estimated as the number of years from the interview date to December 31 , 1996 . The average censored survival time in the sample is 12 . 31 years , and 80 % are alive at the end of follow - up on December 31 , 1996 . The Cox regression makes no distributional assumptions about the functional form of the baseline hazard , as required for most other hazard functions . Besides Table 1 (cid:14) .

Taking these into account , the hazard rate at time t for individual i may be written : h t ; X s h t , 0 e X i b (cid:14) . ( ) (cid:14) . (cid:14) where h t , 0 is the unknown baseline hazard rate at time t the hazard rate for the . respective individual when all covariate values are equal to zero , X is a vector of covariates which shifts the hazard function proportionally , and b is a vector of parameters . While no assumptions are made about the functional form of the baseline hazard , the Cox model assumes a proportional relationship between the hazard function and the log - linear function of the covariates , i . e . it is assumed that the ratio of the hazard function for two individuals does not depend on time , i . e . X i b (cid:14) . (cid:14) . e s h t ; X r h t , 0 measures the hazard function at time t for an individual with a vector of covariates X relative to the baseline function for an individual with covariate vector 0 . As an independent variable in the regression analysis , we use the annuitized lifetime household income per consumption unit in 1996 prices in Swedish (cid:14) . (cid:14) . Crowns SEK Exchange rate 1996 : US $ 1 s SEK 6 . 71 . This income measure consists of two components that are added together : the annuity of the lifetime disposable income and the annuity of net wealth . In our data set , we have information about the disposable income of the household in the interview year . Disposable income is converted to 1996 prices using the consumer price index . 2 A problem with using the disposable income in a single year is that the income varies between years . We therefore estimate the expected lifetime disposable income . The lifetime disposable income is estimated based on the percentage change in income with age in our sample . The percentage change in income with age is estimated separately for men and women and for three education categories in our data set . 3 To estimate the lifetime income , the average life expectancy for (cid:14) . 4 men and women in Sweden is used Statistics Sweden , 1999 . A 3 % discount rate 2 Since the disposable income data is collected each year during the period 1980 – 1986 , one could also argue that the income data should be adjusted for the growth in real income from the year of the survey to 1986 . The growth in real disposable income between 1980 and 1986 was , however , negligible (cid:14) . 4 % and no correction was therefore made . 3 A regression equation of disposable income as a function of age and age - squared is used to (cid:14) estimate the percentage change in disposable income for each year until the age of 65 the retirement . age . After retirement , the annual income is assumed to be constant ; to estimate the percentage change (cid:14) in income at retirement , we use the average income in the 65 – 69 years age - group in our data for the . gender and education category of the individual . 4 In principle , the life expectancy used in this estimation should vary with income since a higher income is associated with a higher life expectancy . However , the bias from using the average life expectancy for all individuals independent of income will be negligible since we use the annuity of (cid:14) lifetime income in the analysis an increased life expectancy thus increases lifetime income , but also . increases the number of life - years in the annuity estimation . ( ) U . - G . Gerdtham , M . Johannesson r Journal of Health Economics 19 2000 1007 – 1026 1011 is used to estimate the lifetime disposable income in present value terms . The annuity of the lifetime income is then used in the analysis . A 3 % interest rate is used to estimate the annuity . From the National Income Tax Statistics we also have information about the (cid:14) . taxable net wealth total taxable assets minus total liabilities of the household during the interview year . Taxable net wealth is converted to 1996 prices using the consumer price index . The data recorded in the National Income Tax Statistics is the taxable net wealth that is used as the basis for the tax on wealth in Sweden . Due to the tax rules , not all assets are valued at the market value in the taxable net wealth measure . Thus , the measure systematically undervalues net wealth . The measure also depends on the tax rules at the time of the survey , which means that the values may not be strictly comparable between the different interview years . We therefore carry out an approximation of the net wealth at market value . 5 The annuity of net wealth is then added to the annuity of annual disposable income to obtain our income measure . A 3 % interest rate is used to estimate the annuity . To find the optimal functional relationship between income and the mortality (cid:14) . rate , a Box – Cox analysis is carried out Box and Cox , 1964 , i . e . a Box – Cox (cid:14) . (cid:14) l . transformation parameter l as defined by the operator : X l s X y 1 r l for l / 0 or ln X for l s 0 , where X is income . In this procedure , we determine the maximum likelihood point estimate for l where a one - dimensional grid search is carried out over the interval y 1 to 1 for l at 0 . 05 increments . In the regression , we also control for age , age - squared and gender . The log - likelihood function is maximized at l s 0 . 24 . In Table 2 , we show the estimated hazard function where l is set at 0 . 24 . 6 The estimated hazard function is then used to estimate the remaining life expectancy of all subjects in our sample . The hazard function gives the annual mortality risk and life expectancy is estimated by estimating the annual risk at all ages for an individual . We estimate the life expectancy in seven (cid:14) . age - groups 20 – 29 , 30 – 39 , 40 – 49 , 50 – 59 , 60 – 69 , 70 – 79 , 80 – 84 years . To standardise for age within each age - group , the age of all individuals in an 5 To carry out this approximation , we estimate the ratio between net wealth at market value and taxable net wealth for each interview year . We then multiply the taxable net wealth by this ratio for each person to get the net wealth of each person . As the measure of net wealth at market value , we use the average value in an investigation about the average household net wealth at market value in the (cid:14) . Swedish adult population in 1983 , 1984 , 1985 and 1988 Statistics Sweden , 1999 . The value of the household net wealth at market value was SEK 322 , 938 in 1996 prices . The ratio between this value and the taxable net wealth was : 1 . 83 in 1980 , 1 . 32 in 1981 , 1 . 35 in 1982 , 1 . 32 in 1983 , 1 . 45 in 1984 , 1 . 47 in 1985 , and 1 . 38 in 1986 . 6 (cid:14) . 2 According to a global rank x - test , the proportionality assumption in the Cox regression is rejected at the 5 % level . More complicated models relaxing this assumption did , however , yield similar results as the standard model or did not converge in the Limdep software . We therefore use the standard Cox model in the estimations . The predicted life expectancy for men and women in different ages based on this model is also very close to the figures in the official Swedish mortality statistics (cid:14) . Statistics Sweden , 1999 , supporting the validity of the model . ( ) U . - G . Gerdtham , M .

The concentration index plots the cumulative proportion of a measure of health against the cumulative proportion of the population ranked from the lowest to highest in terms of socio - economic status . The concentration index is defined as twice the area between the concentration curve and the diagonal , which represents an equal distribution of health across the population , and can take values between q 1 and y 1 . A negative concentration index signifies socio - eco - nomic related health inequality ; it is q 1 when all health is concentrated in those individuals in the highest socio - economic group . The estimations are carried out for men and women separately . The estimations are also carried out with and without discounting of life - years . In economic evaluations , it is common to discount life - years and in the analysis with discount - (cid:14) ing of life - years , we use the currently recommended discount rate of 3 % Wein - . stein et al . , 1996 . It should be noted that the concentration indices estimated with respect to life - years are not directly comparable to the indices estimated by van Doorslaer et (cid:14) . al . 1997 . This is because the concentration indices in the work of van Doorslaer (cid:14) . et al 1997 were defined with respect to ill - health rather than health as here . It is impossible to estimate a concentration index with respect to ill - health for life - years unless some upper limit of life - years is defined so that the loss of life - years can be estimated relative to this upper limit . 7 For both men and women , the following mean age figures are used for 20 – 29 , 30 – 39 , 40 – 49 , 50 – 59 , 60 – 69 , 70 – 79 and 80 – 84 years : 24 . 45 , 34 . 61 , 44 . 12 , 54 . 53 , 64 . 40 , 74 . 37 and 81 . 73 years . The reason that it is important to standardise for age is that there is a correlation between age and income (cid:14) . and age in turn is an important determinant of mortality and health status .

Income - related inequality in QALYs We also adjust the life - years for quality of life in order to be able to estimate the income - related inequality in QALYs . No data about QALY weights is collected in the ULF survey . However , we assigned QALY weights to all subjects in our database , based on a categorical measure of the overall health status that was included in the ULF survey . In the categorical health - rating question , the (cid:14) individuals rated their own current health status on a three - point scale poor health , . 8 fair health , good health . This type of categorical health measure has been shown to capture important information about the individual’s health and to be an (cid:14) important predictor of mortality Kaplan and Camacho , 1983 ; Connelly et al . , . 1989 ; Idler and Kasl , 1991 ; Wannamethe and Shaper , 1991 . To estimate the QALY weights for poor health , fair health and good health , we (cid:14) use another data set collected in Uppsala County in Sweden Gerdtham et al . , . 1999 ; Lundberg et al . , 1999 . This study included a measurement of QALY weights by the time trade - off method . It also included a categorical five - point (cid:14) health - rating question poor health , fair health , good health , very good health , . excellent health . This five - point question is collapsed into a three - point scale to correspond to the question used in the ULF survey . 9 An OLS regression with the QALY weight as dependent variable and the three - point health rating question as independent variable is estimated to predict the QALY weight for poor health , fair health and good health . Age and gender are also included in this regression analysis since these variables may affect the QALY weight independently of the rating on the categorical health rating question (cid:14) . 10 Lundberg et al . , 1999 . This regression equation is used to predict a QALY weight for all subjects in the ULF survey based on their age , gender and rating of their current health status . Based on these QALY weights , we estimate concentra - tion indices for the income - related inequality in health status for men and women in different age groups . These indices are estimated with respect to both health (cid:14) . (cid:14) . i . e . the QALY weight and ill - health 1 y QALY weight , so that the results for (cid:14) . ill - health can be compared to the results in the work of van Doorslaer et al . 1997 . 8 To use a three - point scale for the health status is rather crude , and it would have been preferable to use a more refined health status classification system . However , it will not lead to any systematic bias in the relationship between income and the QALY weight as long as the mean health level within each of the three categories does not vary with income . 9 Excellent health , very good health and good health is assumed to correspond to good health in the three - point scale used in the ULF survey . 10 QALY weight s 0 . 683 q 0 . 261 P GOOD HEALTH q 0 . 143 P FAIR HEALTH q 0 . 009521 P MALE q 0 . 005669 P AGE2 y 0 . 000649 P AGE3 y 0 . 000971 P AGE4 y 0 . 0411 P AGE5 y 0 . 163 P AGE6 y 0 . 261 P AGE7 ; AGE2 s 30 – 39 years , AGE3 s 40 – 49 years , AGE4 s 50 – 59 years , AGE5 s 60 – 69 years , AGE6 s (cid:14) . 70 – 79 years and AGE7 s 80 – 84 years Baseline s 20 – 29 years .

To estimate the expected number of remaining QALYs for an individual in our database , it is not sufficient to know the current QALY weight only , but the QALY weight in future years is needed as well . To predict the change in the QALY weight over time for the individuals in our database , we estimate a regression equation with the predicted QALY weight as the dependent variable and age , age - squared , gender and income as independent variables . To find the optimal functional relationship between income and the QALY weight , we again use a Box – Cox analysis . The log - likelihood function is maximized at l s 0 . 35 . In Table 3 , we show the estimated regression where l is set at 0 . 35 . An OLS regression equation is used with a logistic transformation of the dependent variable (cid:14) . 11 since the QALY weights are between 0 and 1 Greene , 1997 . Based on this regression , we predict the change in the QALY weights over time for the subjects in our database . The information about the QALY weights over time is combined with the estimated life - years to estimate the expected number of remaining QALYs for all subjects in our database . The estimated number of remaining QALYs for all individuals in our sample is used to estimate the concentration (cid:14) index for QALYs in the different age - groups and for the entire sample estimated . as the weighted average of the concentration indices in the different age - groups . The estimations are carried out for men and women separately and with and without discounting of QALYs . As noted above , these concentration indices for QALYs are not directly comparable to the indices estimated by van Doorslaer et (cid:14) . al . 1997 , since the indices are estimated with respect to health rather than ill - health . 11 A logistic transformation of the dependent variable could not be used for the equation where we predict QALY weights based on the self rated health status using data from the Uppsala study . This is (cid:14) . because a large proportion of the QALY weights in that data set are equal to 1 full health . However , all the predictions from that equation for our sample in the ULF database fall between 0 and 1 . ( ) U . - G . Gerdtham , M .

Gerdtham , M . Johannesson r Journal of Health Economics 19 2000 1007 – 1026 1020 (cid:14) . The concentration indices for health status the QALY weights are also shown in Tables 6 and 7 . For men , the concentration index increases with age until the oldest age - group and varies between 0 . 0015 in the youngest age - group and 0 . 0126 in the 70 – 79 years age - group . The weighted average for all age - groups is 0 . 0060 . For women , the concentration index increases with age from 0 . 0022 in the youngest age - group to 0 . 0111 in the oldest age - group . The weighted average for all age - groups is 0 . 0058 . For both men and women the concentration indices in all age groups are significantly different from 0 at the 5 % level . 12 For comparisons (cid:14) . with previous studies , the concentration indices for ill health 1 y QALY weight are also shown in Tables 6 and 7 . These indices show a different pattern with respect to age . For both men and women , the indices in absolute terms increase (cid:14) . with age until the middle age - group 50 – 59 years and then decrease again . The weighted average concentration index for ill - health is y 0 . 0477 for men and y 0 . 0381 for women . These figures are similar to the figure of y 0 . 0347 for (cid:14) . Sweden reported in the study by van Doorslaer et al . 1997 . 3 . 3 . Income - related inequality in remaining QALYs The estimated expected number of remaining QALYs in different age - groups (cid:14) . (cid:14) . and income deciles are shown in Table 8 men and Table 9 women . The pattern is the same as for life - years . For men in the age - group 20 – 29 years , the number of (cid:14) . (cid:14) QALYs is 43 . 7 23 . 5 with discounting in the lowest income decile and 47 . 2 24 . 5 . with discounting in the highest income decile . For men in the age - group 80 – 84 (cid:14) . years , the number of QALYs is 2 . 3 2 . 1 with discounting in the lowest income (cid:14) . decile and 3 . 3 3 . 0 with discounting in the highest income decile . For women in (cid:14) . the age - group 20 – 29 years , the number of QALYs is 45 . 7 23 . 8 with discounting (cid:14) . in the lowest income decile and 49 . 0 24 . 8 with discounting in the highest income decile . For women in the age - group 80 – 84 years , the number of QALYs is 2 . 9 (cid:14) . (cid:14) . 2 . 6 with discounting in the lowest income decile and 3 . 9 3 . 4 with discounting in the highest income decile . The concentration indices for QALYs are also shown in Tables 8 and 9 . The concentration indices increase somewhat for both men and women compared to the case for life - years . The weighted average for all age - groups for men is 0 . 0251 without discounting of QALYs and 0 . 0201 with discounting of QALYs . For 12 (cid:14) In the tables , we only report standard errors of the concentration indices for health status QALY . weights , and not for the concentration indices for expected remaining life - years and QALYs . The reason for this is that the number of remaining life - years and QALYs are estimated based on the hazard (cid:14) function relating income to mortality and there would therefore be no sample variation in life - years for . individuals with the same income leading to artificially low standard errors . The significance test of the income variable in the hazard function can be viewed of as a test of if there is a significant income related inequality in life - years , and as seen in Table 2 the income variable is highly significant .

Concluding remarks We have estimated the income - related inequality in Sweden with respect to (cid:14) . life - years , health status current QALY weights and QALYs . For all measures , we discovered inequalities in health favouring the higher income groups . As a measure of the income - related inequality in health , we used the concentra - (cid:14) . tion index as used previously by van Doorslaer et al . 1997 for health status . It is important to note , however , that our estimated concentration indices for life - years and QALYs are not directly comparable to the concentration indices in the study (cid:14) . by van Doorslaer et al . 1997 . This is because they estimated concentration indices with respect to ill - health rather than health . For life - years and QALYs , it is not possible to define a measure of ill - health unless some upper limit of life - years is determined . However , for health status we estimated the concentration indices with respect to both ill - health and health . Our concentration index for ill - health was y 0 . 0477 for men and y 0 . 0381 for women , which is similar to the index of (cid:14) . y 0 . 0347 for Sweden in the study by van Doorslaer et al . 1997 . For men , the difference in the number of life - years between the highest and the (cid:14) . lowest income decile was 4 . 1 years 1 . 0 with discounting in the youngest (cid:14) . (cid:14) . age - group 20 – 29 years and 2 . 1 years 1 . 7 with discounting in the oldest (cid:14) . age - group 80 – 84 years . After incorporation of quality of life , these differences (cid:14) . decreased to 3 . 6 QALYs 1 . 0 with discounting in the youngest age - group and 1 . 0 (cid:14) . QALYs 0 . 9 with discounting in the oldest age - group . For women , the corre - sponding differences in life - years and QALYs between the lowest and highest (cid:14) . (cid:14) income deciles were 3 . 8 life - years 0 . 8 with discounting and 3 . 4 QALYs 1 . 0 . (cid:14) with discounting in the youngest age - group and 2 . 1 life - years 1 . 6 with discount - . (cid:14) . ing and 1 . 0 QALYs 0 . 9 with discounting in the oldest age - group . The quality adjustment has two effects on the absolute inequality in health that work in opposite directions . The first effect is that quality adjustment increases inequality since the quality weights tend to increase with income . The second effect is that quality adjustment decreases inequality since the additional life - years in higher income groups are not in full health . Overall , the quality adjustment decreases the absolute differences between income deciles , but it leads to a slight increase in the concentration indices . That the quality adjustment decreases the absolute difference between income deciles , is contrary to the results of Williams (cid:14) . 1997 for social classes in the UK . This difference in results is due to that the difference in QALY weights between social classes was greater in the study by (cid:14) . Williams 1997 than the difference in QALY weights between income groups in this study . The first effect of the quality adjustment outlined above was thus more (cid:14) . pronounced in the study by Williams 1997 than in the present study . ( ) U . - G . Gerdtham , M . Johannesson r Journal of Health Economics 19 2000 1007 – 1026 1024 Our concentration indices for income - related inequalities tended to increase with age . This is because the relative difference in remaining QALYs between income groups increased with age . For men the relative difference in the number of QALYs between the highest and the lowest income decile increased from 8 % in the youngest age - group to 44 % in the oldest age - group and the concentration index increased from 0 . 0117 in the youngest age - group to 0 . 0594 in the oldest age - group . For women the relative difference in the number of QALYs between the highest and the lowest income decile increased from 7 % in the youngest age - group to 37 % in the oldest age - group and the concentration index increased from 0 . 0107 in the youngest age - group to 0 . 0460 in the oldest age - group . That the concentration index varies with age means that comparisons between for instance countries may be affected by differences in age distributions across countries . This is also true for the concentration indices calculated with respect to (cid:14) . ill - health in the study by van Doorslaer et al . 1997 . It is also interesting to note that the pattern with respect to age differs according to whether the concentration indices are defined in terms of ill - health or health . Our concentration indices with (cid:14) . respect to ill - health 1 y QALY weight for both men and women increased with age until 50 – 59 years and then decreased with age . On the other hand , the (cid:14) . corresponding indices for health QALY weight generally increased with age . The reason for these divergent results is that a specific absolute difference in health may imply a different relative difference depending on whether health or ill - health is being used . This also implies that the ranking in terms of income - related inequality in health between for instance countries may differ depending on whether ill - health or health is used in the calculated concentration indices . Whether the observed differences in life - years and QALYs between income groups for Sweden should be considered as large and important or small and insignificant is a difficult issue . In relative terms , the differences between income groups are rather small , with the exception of the oldest age - groups . For instance , in the youngest age - group for women the number of QALYs is only 7 % higher in the highest income decile than in the lowest income decile . With discounting of QALYs , this relative difference decreases to 4 % . However , with a valuation of a (cid:14) discounted QALY gained of US $ 100 , 000 , as used in a recent study Cutler and . Richardson , 1998 , even small differences in the number of QALYs would amount to important differences in welfare . With such a value of a QALY gained , the difference of 1 . 0 discounted QALYs between the highest and the lowest income decile for women in the youngest age - group would be equivalent to a difference of US $ 100 , 000 in lifetime wealth . Finally , we note that the relationship between income and health should not be interpreted causally . The purpose of this type of analysis is not to estimate the causal effect of income on health but merely to describe how health varies between income groups . The observed association between income and health can (cid:14) emerge both because income affects health and the other way around for a review (cid:14) . . of this issue , see the work of Smith 1999 . It could also be because income is ( ) U . - G . Gerdtham , M .
