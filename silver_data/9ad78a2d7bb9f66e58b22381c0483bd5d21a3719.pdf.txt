Robinson 1 , 4 Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is essential for a wide range of cellular functions . We used a multi - step siRNA - based screening strategy to identify regulators of the ﬁrst step in clathrin - mediated endocytosis , formation of clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) at the plasma membrane . A primary genome - wide screen identiﬁed 334 hits that caused accumulation of CCV cargo on the cell surface . A secondary screen identiﬁed 92 hits that inhibited cargo uptake and / or altered the morphology of clathrin - coated structures . The hits include components of four functional complexes : coat proteins , V - ATPase subunits , spliceosome - associated proteins and acetyltransferase subunits . Electron microscopy revealed that V - ATPase depletion caused the cell to form aberrant non - constricted clathrin - coated structures at the plasma membrane . The V - ATPase - knockdown phenotype was rescued by addition of exogenous cholesterol , indicating that the knockdown blocks clathrin - mediated endocytosis by preventing cholesterol from recycling from endosomes back to the plasma membrane . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is the pathway used by cells to internalize a variety of proteins and lipids . It is essential for processes as diverse as nutrient uptake , regulation of signalling by hormones and growth factors , and recycling of synaptic vesicle membranes . Although much of the machinery responsible for CME has been identified and characterized , the mechanisms that regulate CME are much less well understood . Several recent studies have emphasized the complexity of these regulatory mechanisms 1 – 4 . For instance , an short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) library screen for genes involved in the endocytosis of transferrin and epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , both of which are taken up by CME , identified over 4 , 600 hits 3 . These genes most likely act at many different stages of the endocytic pathway , both upstream of CCV formation ( for example , transcription and translation of transferrin and EGF receptors ) and downstream ( for example , trafficking between differenttypesofendosomesandbetweenendosomesandlysosomes ) . Here , we set out to identify genes that specifically control the formation of CCVs at the plasma membrane ( PM ) . We adopted a multi - step siRNA - based approach ( Fig . 1 ) , involving plate - reader - based assays to quantify the surface accumulation and internalization efficiency of model CCV cargo proteins , and a high - throughput 1 Cambridge Institute for Medical Research , Wellcome Trust / MRC Building , University of Cambridge , Hills Road , Cambridge CB2 0XY , UK . 2 London Research Institute , Lincoln’s Inn Fields Laboratories , 44 Lincoln’s Inn Fields , London WC2A 3LY , UK . 3 Present addresses : Department for Fundamental Neurosciences , University of Lausanne , Rue du Bugnon 9 , 1005 Lausanne , Switzerland ( D .

Out of 92 top hits , we chose subunits of the V - ATPase for a more detailed analysis . RESULTS Genome - wide screening approach Inhibition of CME leads to the accumulation of clathrin - dependent cargo proteins on the cell surface . Hence , for the primary screen , we designed an assay to identify siRNAs from a human genome - wide library that cause an increase in the surface levels of two model CCV cargo proteins : CD8 - YXX (cid:56) and CD8 - FXNPXY . These two constructs contain the extracellular / lumenal and transmembrane domains of a T - cell - specific protein , CD8 , followed by very simple cytosolic tails containing the critical residues from either the YXX (cid:56) or the FXNPXY endocytic motif surrounded by alanines ( Fig . 1 ) . We have previously shown that both of these constructs are efficiently endocytosed in a clathrin - dependent manner 5 , and for the present study , they were stably transfected into HeLa cells and expressed under the control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter . For the purpose of our screen , CD8 - YXX (cid:56) and CD8 - FXNPXY have two advantages over 50 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 15 | NUMBER 1 | JANUARY 2013 © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

( a ) In the primary genome - wide screen , 21 , 121 siGENOME SMARTpools ( SPs ; four siRNAs per gene ) were screened using a plate - reader - based assay for hits that lead to accumulation of clathrin - dependent cargo proteins on the cell surface , without increasing the levels of surface MHC class I ( see also Fig . 2 ) . CD8 chimaeras with YXX (cid:56) or FXNPXY motifs inserted into their cytoplasmic tails were used as model CCV cargo . Two hundred and forty - one primary - screen positives were selected for the secondary screens . ( b , c ) The efﬁciency of endocytosis was measured using the CD8 - chimaera - expressing cells ( b , see also Fig . 3 ) and the morphology of CCSs at the PM was assessed using a CALM immunolabelling and automated high - throughput ( HT ) microscopy - based assay ( c , see also Fig . 4 ) .

Surface accumulation of CCV cargo The siRNA library used for the primary screen targets 20 , 052 genes with SMARTpools of four siRNAs , arrayed in 267 96 - well plates . Every plate also contained both positive controls ( CLTC ( clathrin heavy chain ) and AP2M1 ( AP - 2 µ subunit ) siRNAs ) and negative controls ( PLK1 siRNA , no siRNA and RISC - free siRNA ; Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . The siRNAs were reverse transfected into the CD8 - YXX (cid:56) and CD8 - FXNPXY cell lines in duplicate ( that is , 4 sets of plates in total ) . After 72h , the cells were fixed and immunostained for surface CD8 ( Alexa 488 ) . To identify siRNAs causing non - clathrin - mediated changes in cell surface proteins 6 , the cells were also stained for the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I subunit , β 2m ( Alexa 647 ) . Hoechst stain was used as an indicator of cell number ( Fig . 1a ) . The fluorescence data for 52 spots across each well were collected in three channels using a plate reader ( Fig . 2a ) . Figure 2b shows a plot of the Alexa 488 and Hoechst readings from a sample plate on which there was a strong hit , DNM2 ( dynamin 2 ) . Plots of all the raw data can be found at http : / / www . bioinformatics . cimr . cam . ac . uk / siRNA / Robinson _ Screen . After excluding any non - viable knockdowns from further analysis , the ratio of Alexa 488 to Hoechst fluorescence intensity was used as a measure of CD8 accumulation on the PM . To control for plate - to - plate variability in staining and knockdown efficiency , the Alexa 488 / Hoechst ratios from each plate were normalized to the positive ( CLTC ) and negative ( no knockdown ) controls ( Supplementary Figs S2 and S3 ) . There was a high correlation between the two technical repeats ( R 2 = 0 . 94 for YXX (cid:56) , 0 . 84 for FXNPXY ) as well biological repeats ( R 2 = 0 . 65 for YXX (cid:56) , 0 . 89 for FXNPXY ; Supplementary Fig . S4a , b ) . We used strictly standardized mean difference 7 ( SSMD ) to combine the duplicate measurements and rank SMARTpools according to both strength and reproducibility of phenotype ( Fig . 2c and Supplementary Fig . S4c ) . An SSMD of greater than three was used as the threshold for hit selection . All of the hits for the CD8 - YXX (cid:56) cells had at least 2 . 85 - fold more surface CD8 than the negative control , and all of the hits for the CD8 - FXNPXY cells had at least 2 . 39 - fold more surface CD8 . For both cell lines , CLTC and DNM2 were among the top hits . AP2M1 was a strong hit only for the CD8 - YXX (cid:56) cells .

( a ) Cells transfected with the siRNAs were ﬁxed after 72h and stained for surface CD8 ( Alexa 488 ) , surface MHC class I ( Alexa 647 ) and DNA ( Hoechst ) . Using a plate reader , 52 points were scanned in each of the three ﬂuorescence channels , here shown on a sample plate for Alexa 488 . The ﬂuorescence intensity of each point is colour - coded according to the scale presented ( RFU , relative ﬂuorescence units ) , and the corresponding plate map is presented in Supplementary Fig . S1 . ( b ) Alexa 488 ( surface CD8 - YXX (cid:56) ) and Hoechst readouts from one of the screening plates . Each point represents one well ( one SMARTpool ) . Control wells are colour - coded according to the legend and grey points represent the library wells . Similar plots for each tested SMARTpool can be found at http : / / www . bioinformatics . cimr . cam . ac . uk / siRNA / Robinson _ Screen . To analyse the data further , we calculated the ratio of Alexa 488 / Hoechst ﬂuorescence intensity for each point and then normalized the ratios to the positive ( CLTC ) and negative ( RISC - free , mock ) controls ( see Supplementary Figs S2 and S3 ) . ( c ) Screening results for the 21 , 121 SMARTpools . For each pool , the strength ( normalized Alexa 488 / Hoechst ratio of the duplicates ) and reproducibility were scored using SSMD ( see Supplementary Fig . S4 ) . The red line indicates the threshold for hit selection ( SSMD > 3 ) and the blue line the threshold for cell viability . SMARTpools against CLTC , AP2M1 , DNM2 and DAB2 present in the library are colour - coded .

SMARTpools with SSMD > 3 were selected as primary - screen positives and analysed for sequence speciﬁcity according to RefSeq 25 , mRNA expression ( Supplementary Table S3 ) and phenotype speciﬁcity ( increase on the cell surface speciﬁc for CCV - cargo alone , not accompanied by an increase of MHC - I ) . NA , not available . CD8 - FXNPXY cells but below the selection threshold , consistent with reports that both DAB2 and ARH have to be knocked down simultaneously to prevent internalization of FXNPXY - containing proteins 8 . As expected , several SMARTpools caused an increase of both CD8 - YXX (cid:56) and CD8 - FXNPXY ( R 2 = 0 . 47 ) . However , there was no correlation between the CD8 constructs and MHC - I ( R 2 = 0 . 01 ; Fig . 2d ) . Supplementary Table S1 lists the 719 SMARTpools with SSMDs > 3 for either or both of the motifs . Selection of hits for secondary assays To eliminate some of the potential false positives , we applied three exclusion criteria to the primary hit list ( Fig . 2e ) . First , the siRNA targets were re - annotated according to version 25 of the RefSeq database , and where multiple or no target messenger RNAs were identified , a SMARTpool was excluded from the hit list . Second , we performed microarray analyses and excluded hits for which the target mRNA was represented on the microarray but not detected . Finally , we excluded hits where the increase of CD8 on the cell surface was accompanied by an increase in MHC - I , as these genes are unlikely to control CME . Out of the 334 hits remaining , the 241 top hits ( Supplementary Table S1a ) were selected for secondary screens , in which we used a set of different siRNA pools , chemically modified to reduce the off - target activity and designed with improved sequence selection algorithms ( ONTARGETplus , OTP ; refs 9 , 10 ) . Efﬁciency of CME To confirm that knockdowns causing an increase in surface levels of CD8 specifically affect endocytosis , we determined the internalization efficiency of the CD8 constructs using a previously described antibody uptake assay 5 , adapted here for high - throughput analysis with a plate reader and shown diagrammatically in Fig . 1b . Briefly , the siRNA - transfected CD8 - YXX (cid:56) and CD8 - FXNPXY cells were first allowed to internalize an anti - CD8 - Alexa 488 antibody for 40min at 37 ◦ C . The cells were then fixed , surface Alexa 488 fluorescence signal was quenched with an anti - Alexa 488 antibody , and surface CD8 was relabelled with an Alexa 647 secondary antibody ( Fig . 3a ) . The ratio of green to red fluorescence intensity normalized to positive and negative controls in each plate was then used as a measure of internalization efficiency ( 0 corresponds to inhibition in CLTC knockdown cells , and 1 to uptake efficiency in negative ( no knockdown ) controls ; Fig . 3b ) . 28 52 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 15 | NUMBER 1 | JANUARY 2013 © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Morphology of clathrin - coated structures at the PM To identify hits that affect the formation of endocytic CCVs , we designedanautomatedmicroscopy - basedassaytocharacterizeclathrin - coated structures ( CCSs ) at the PM . We labelled the CCSs with an antibody against CALM , an accessory protein that co - localizes with clathrin at the PM , but not on intracellular membranes 11 , 12 ( Fig . 1c ) . The prerequisite for quantitative high - throughput microscopy is obtaining good quality images , and in the case of PM CCSs , the optimal focal plane is where cells adhere to the growth surface . Thus , as a reference , we used hydrophilic Cy5 - labelled flow cytometry beads , which settle between the cells at the bottom of the dish . Whole - cell stain ( WCS ) was used to demark cell boundaries , and a SpotDetector BioApplicationwasusedtoidentifyCCSsineachcell ( Fig . 4a ) . We screened the 241 selected siRNA pools by reverse transfecting the cells in duplicate as before , then splitting the plates into four different densities after 48h , and fixing and staining the cells after 72h . The analysis was performed in two independent experiments with 300 – 2 , 000 valid cells analysed for each knockdown ( Supplementary Table S2 ) . Mitotic cells and cells from dense fields were excluded from the analysis ( Fig . 4b , c ) . We focused on changes in total fluorescence intensity per spot and spot count per area ( Fig . 4d – f ) and selected 67 hits falling into three categories : increase in spot brightness ( red ) , decrease in spot brightness ( blue ) , and decrease in spot count without a change in brightness ( yellow ) . Functional networks within genes that affect CCS morphology and CME efﬁciency The 92 hits combined from the two secondary assays ( 22 of which were shared hits ) were analysed using the STRING database 13 . Four groups of functionally or genetically linked genes were identified ( Fig . 5 ) . CLTC , DNM2 and AP2M1 were correctly assigned to one network . The remaining three networks comprise : subunits of the vacuolar ATPase ( V - ATPase ; ATP6V0C , ATP6V0E , ATP6V1B2 , ATP6V1D , ATP6V1F ) ; genes involved in mRNA splicing ( CDC5L , CDC40 , SFRS3 , SF3B3 , SF3B4 , SFPQ , SFRS3 ) ; and the histone acetyltransferase complex ( RUVBL2 , EP400 , HTATIP ( KAT5 ) ) . We decided to focus on V - ATPase for the present study . Ultrastructure of CCSs following depletion or inhibition of V - ATPase Although V - ATPase plays an important role in endocytic trafficking by controlling the intralumenal pH of endosomes and lysosomes , a role in the formation of CCVs at the PM was unexpected . siRNAs againsteightcomponentsofV - ATPasewerepresentamongtheprimary hits , and using the OTP pools , we verified that the knockdowns also inhibit internalization of an endogenous ligand , transferrin ( Fig . 6a ) . To investigate the ultrastructure of the brighter CCSs observed in VATPase - depleted cells ( Fig . 6b ) , we turned to electron microscopy . Strikingly , knocking down V - ATPase caused the cells to accumulate large and irregular CCPs with average neck diameters of 220 nm ( compared with 97nm in control cells ) , whereas constricted pits were notably absent ( Fig . 6c , d , e ) .

Within each network , the colour of the symbol indicates the phenotype in the CCS morphology screen , and the shape of the symbol indicates the phenotype in the endocytosis efﬁciency screen . KAT5 is the ofﬁcial gene symbol for the gene annotated in the library as HTATIP . Although theoretically one would expect all of the genes encoding subunits of the same complex to have the same knockdown phenotype , in practice there are differences due to factors such as knockdown efﬁciency and threshold for hit selection . In addition , genes from the same functional cluster might have different regulatory effects on CCVs components , and therefore different effects on CCS intensity . occurred progressively over the 24h period , and resulted in a gradual accumulation of the transferrin receptor at the cell surface ( Fig . 6g ) . In a similar time - course experiment , we observed a corresponding increase in the brightness of CALM - labelled CCSs ( Fig . 6h ) . Electron microscopy analysis revealed that at 17h , BafA1 - treated cells also accumulate wide , non - constricted CCSs ( Fig . 6i – k ) . Together , these data suggest that siRNA - mediated depletion of different V - ATPase subunits , or inhibition of V - ATPase activity with BafA1 , blocks CME by preventing CCPs from forming CCVs . V - ATPase inhibition and cytosolic acidiﬁcation As V - ATPase is a proton pump 15 and clathrin polymerization has been shown to be sensitive to pH ( ref . 16 ) , we suspected initially that V - ATPase depletion or BafA1 treatment might prevent CCV formation by decreasing the pH of the cytosol . Previous studies on unroofed cells have shown that cytosol acidification leads to an accumulation of arrested CCSs surrounded by membraneless microcages 16 . Using a similar technique , we generated PM replicas from control and BafA1 - treated cells to examine their three - dimensional architecture . The micrographs confirmed the abundance of enlarged CCSs and revealed an astounding variety in their morphologies ( Fig . 7a , b ) . However , wedidnotseeanyevidenceofmicrocageformation . Twoothertreatmentsthatleadtoablockinendocytosiscoupledwith microcage formation , hypertonic sucrose and potassium depletion 17 , simultaneously block clathrin exchange 18 . Therefore , we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) experiments on cells transfected with GFP - tagged clathrin light chain , cultured in the presence or absence of BafA1 ( Fig . 7c , d ) . BafA1 treatment did not significantly affect the recovery kinetics , again arguing that clathrin is unlikely to be locked in microcages . Finally , we measured the cytosolic and submembranous pH using soluble and PM - targeted SuperEcliptic ( SE ) pHluorin – mCherry fusion proteins 19 ( Fig . 7e ) . As the SEpHluorin fluorescence intensity decreases on protonation , the ratio of green to red signal can be used to estimate pH , as demonstrated by incubating the cells in buffers of different pH in the presence of an ionophore , nigericin ( Fig . 7f , g ) . Treatment with BafA1 for 24 h resulted in only a modest pH decrease . As pH 6 . 5 – 6 . 8 has been consistently reported as the threshold at which CME is inhibited 19 , 20 , we concluded that changes to cytosolic pH and microcage formation are unlikely to explain CME inhibition in the V - ATPase - depleted cells . CCV formation in cells lacking functional V - ATPase can be rescued with soluble cholesterol If the inhibition of CCV formation after V - ATPase inhibition cannot be attributed to a decrease in cytosolic pH , another possibility is that it could be a consequence of the alkalization of endosomes . It has been known for over 30 years that if endosomes cannot acidify , trafficking out of them is inhibited 21 , and this is thought to be due to a general block in the formation of carriers 22 . If an essential CCV membrane component were unable to recycle back to the PM , this would help to explain the BafA1 kinetics , because it would take time for this component to be depleted . A candidate for the missing component emerged from the observation that the morphology of the CCSs in V - ATPase - depleted cells is strikingly similar to the enlarged , shallow clathrin - coated invaginations that form after extraction of cholesterol from the PM with methyl - β - cyclodextrin 23 , 24 . Similarly to the transferrin receptor , cholesterol recycles from endosomes to the PM ( ref . 25 ) , and consequently , in the presence of BafA1 it accumulates in endosomes and is depleted from the cell surface 26 , 27 . We found that if we either knocked down V - ATPase or treated cells with BafA1 for 24h , cholesterol ( labelled with filipin ) was lost from the PM and accumulated in an intracellular compartment , and we were able to quantify this change in three different cell lines using an automated microscopy - based assay ( Fig . 8a , b ) . Double labelling indicates that the filipin - positive compartment also contains trapped CCV cargo proteins ( Supplementary Fig . S6 ) . To investigate whether the loss of PM cholesterol could explain the block in endocytosis , we added exogenous cholesterol to the cells together with BafA1 or siRNAs targeting V - ATPase ( Supplementary Fig . S7 ) . We found that transferrin internalization was partially rescued ( Fig . 8c , d ) , and there was also a rescue of CCS ultrastructure in PM replicas ( Fig . 8e , f ) and a corresponding decrease in CCS brightness ( Fig . 8g ) . DISCUSSION To identify regulators of CCV formation , we carried out a multi - step siRNA - based screen . In the primary screen , hits were defined as siRNA pools that caused CCV cargo proteins with YXX (cid:56) or FXNPXY motifs to accumulate on the PM . Using further selection criteria based on gene expression and siRNA pool specificity , we narrowed down the NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 15 | NUMBER 1 | JANUARY 2013 55 © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Overall , the hit selection criteria applied are highly stringent and therefore may produce false negatives . However , this strategy allowed us to identify a small number of high - confidence hits , which we characterized in more detail . To identify genes that control endocytosis at the step of CCV formation , we performed two secondary screens . First , we carried out an uptake assay , which allowed us to distinguish knockdowns that decrease the efficiency of CME from those that increase surface levels of CD8 for other reasons ( for example , inefficient lysosomal degradation ) . Second , we carried out a microscopy - based assay , which allowed us to identify knockdowns that alter the morphology of CCSs at the PM . As the intensity of CALM fluorescence peaks during vesicle scission 28 , an increase in spot brightness could correspond to an accumulation of deeply invaginated pits 29 ( for example , in NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 15 | NUMBER 1 | JANUARY 2013 57 © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

A decrease in spot count or brightness suggests inefficient coat nucleation or recruitment 31 . From the final set of 92 hits , only CLTC , AP2M1 and DNM2 have beendetectedinCCVsbyproteomics 32 . Thisis , however , notsurprising considering that individual knockdowns of accessory CCV components 58 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 15 | NUMBER 1 | JANUARY 2013 © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved . A R T I C L E S ( for example , CALM ( ref . 33 ) or epsins 34 ) rarely lead to endocytic arrest . Thus , the siRNA - based approach seems to be biased towards proteins not physically incorporated into CCVs . Other proteins implicated in CCV formation , such as FCHo1 / 2 and Rab5A / B / C , were also not picked up as strong hits , possibly because they are encoded by functionally redundant genes ( this functional redundancy also helps to explain why only one of the four AP - 2 subunits was present in the list ) . Although the purpose of this screen was to identify regulators of clathrin - mediated trafficking , the data we have generated can be mined to look for genes involved in other pathways as well . For instance , knockdowns that decrease surface expression of a particular protein may affect its secretion and / or recycling . In addition , for each knockdown , the MHC - I results are also available and will be an interesting data set to explore , especially because post - Golgi trafficking pathways of MHC - I are poorly characterized 6 and 30 % of MHC - I hits correspond to unknown proteins . All of our data can be accessed at http : / / www . bioinformatics . cimr . cam . ac . uk / siRNA / Robinson _ Screen . Out of our 92 hits , several are uncharacterized proteins , such as those encoded by HLXB9 and LOC124220 , which we have now validated with two or more distinct siRNAs , and which we intend to characterize more fully . Other hits have been at least partially characterized , and this enabled us to group them into three functional networks ( plus the network containing coat components ) . One network consists of several components of the mammalian spliceosome . Interestingly , a number of CCV proteins exist in multiple splice variants , including the α and β subunits of AP - 2 ( ref . 35 ) , clathrin light chains 36 and dynamin 2 ( refs 37 , 38 ) . The spliceosome is also essential for cell - cycle progression 39 , and as endocytosis is arrested in mitotic cells 40 , further experiments will be required to resolve whether the endocytic block in spliceosome - depleted cells is due to incorrect splicing of coat proteins , or is a consequence of the mitotic arrest . The second unexpected functional cluster contains subunits of the histone acetyltransferase complex . Histone acetylation plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression ; however , three lines of evidence suggest that the block in CME may be due to changes in the acetylation of cytoplasmic proteins rather than histones . First , acetylation sites have been identified in three core components of CCVs : clathrin , AP - 2 and dynamin 2 ( ref . 41 ) . Second , both RUVBL2 and KAT5 can translocate to the cytoplasm under certain conditions 42 – 44 . Third , in a hepatic cell line , WIF - B , a 30min treatment with trichostatin A , a deacetylase inhibitor , was found to arrest deeply invaginated pits before fission 45 , and the short timescale argues against this effect being due to transcriptional regulation . Finding the key target ( s ) of the acetyltransferase complex will be critical for deciphering the role of acetylation in CME . The third unexpected network , which we analysed in more detail , contains several V - ATPase subunits . We discovered that the block in CCV formation in V - ATPase - depleted cells can be explained by the retention of cholesterol in non - acidified endosomes , and its concomi - tant loss from the PM . At first glance , this phenotype is reminiscent of Niemann – Pick type C ( NPC ) disease , where mutations in pH - sensitive NPC1 or NPC2 lead to accumulation of cholesterol in endosomes and lysosomes 46 , 47 . However , in NPC cells , cholesterol is still exchanged with the PM ( refs 48 , 49 ) and endocytosis still occurs 50 . In contrast , when endosomes are unable to acidify , trafficking out of them becomes inhibited . Although this phenomenon was first observed in the 1980s ( ref . 21 ) , it still awaits a molecular explanation , but endosome acidifica - tionisclearlyimportantfortherecyclingoflipidsaswellasproteins . Similarly , the precise function of cholesterol in CCV formation is not entirely clear . However , as transbilayer diffusion of cholesterol is fast ( < 1 s ; refs 51 , 52 ) relative to the half - time of CCV formation ( ∼ 100 s ; ref . 28 ) , it is possible that the spontaneous flip - flop of cholesterol could simply lower the membrane - bending energy . Thus , although the coat is still able to curve the membrane into a CCP in the absence of cholesterol , the energy required for the neck to constrict may be too great 52 ( Fig . 8h ) . In yeast , budding of CCVs from intracellular membranes requires a lipid flippase , Drs2p , consistent with the notion that the distribution of lipids between the two leaflets of the bilayer is important for membrane deformation 53 . TheroleofV - ATPaseinCMEisparticularlyrelevantinlightofrecent therapeutic strategies against cancer that target V - ATPase activity 54 . Interestingly , one such study demonstrated that BafA1 - induced inhibition of cell growth can be rescued with cholesterol or iron 55 . The authorsassumedthatreceptor - mediatedendocytosiswasstilloccurring normally in the BafA1 - treated cells , but that iron and cholesterol were unable to be released in endosomes and lysosomes . However , the present study demonstrates that long - term BafA1 treatment inhibits CME , and this might account , at least in part , for the cytostatic effects of the V - ATPase inhibitors . V - ATPase activity has also been implicated in signalling by both Notch 56 , 57 and Wnt ( refs 58 , 59 ) . Although again it was assumed that the molecules were still getting internalized , and that the phenotype was caused by pH - dependent events in the endosome , it is important to note that the Notch and Wnt pathways both require clathrin and dynamin 60 – 63 . Thus , the connection we have uncovered between endosome acidification , cholesterol trafficking and CCV formation may help to explain a number of observations on the role of V - ATPase in growth control and development .

The A431 cells were grown in DMEM GlutaMAX - I ( Gibco ) with 10 % FBS , 100Uml − 1 penicillin and 100 µ gml − 1 streptomycin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . All cells were grown at 37 ◦ C with 5 % CO 2 . For DNA transfections , cells were grown to 50 % confluency and transfected for 24h using a Trans IT - HeLaMONSTER Transfection Kit ( Mirus ) with 2 µ g plasmid DNA per well of a 6 - well plate . mRNA analysis . RNA was isolated from 10 6 CD8 - YXX (cid:56) or CD8 - FXNPXY cells ( collectedbytrypsinization ) usingthePurescriptRNAPurificationKit ( LifeSciences Germany ) . Samples were processed and analysed at the Centre for Microarray Resources ( Department of Pathology , University of Cambridge ) . The analysis was performed using an Illumina HumanRef - 8 . v2 BeadChip array scanned on Illumina BeadStation 500 platform . The list of expressed genes was generated using low - stringency criteria to minimize the number of false negatives . Variance - stabilizing transform and robust spline normalization algorithms 65 from the lumi R package 66 were used to process the signal intensity data . Using a P - value threshold of < 0 . 01 , 12 , 269 probes with a signal intensity above the background in at least one of the technical replicates of either of the cell line were selected ( listed in Supplementary Table S3 ) . MIAME - compatible data were submitted to GEO ( accession : GSE39954 ) . siRNA reverse - transfection protocol . A 96 - well plate with 10 µ l of 1 µ M pre - aliquoted siRNAs was used to generate 4 assay plates ( Viewplates , Cat . No . 6005182 , PerkinElmer ; see Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . First , 72 µ l of Opti - MEM I ( Invitrogen ) was added to each well of the transfection plate . Oligofectamine ( Invitrogen ) was pre - incubated with Opti - MEM in a 1 : 8 ratio for 8min , and 18 µ l of the mix was added to each well . The transfection mix was incubated for 20 min at room temperature , and aliquoted into assay plates ( 20 µ l per well ) . Next , 4 , 500 cells in 100 µ lofDMEM ( withpenicillin / streptomycinand l - glutamine ) wereaddedtoeach well , andtheplatesweregentlyvortexed , andthenincubatedat37 ◦ Cin5 % CO 2 for 72h . For knockdowns in 6 - well plates , the volumes per well were scaled up 20 × . Genome - wide and secondary screens . Detailed protocols , methods for data analysis and hit selection strategy are provided in Supplementary Note . Cholesterolredistributionassay . The cells were seeded in the 96 - well plates 24h before the analysis and fixed in 3 . 3 % formaldehyde in PBS for 30min at room temperature . The cells were then washed in PBS and stained with filipin ( 1 : 1 , 000 in PBS ) and WCS green for 2h . Cy5 beads ( see CCS assay ) in PBS were added before imaging . The images were acquired on the Arrayscan platform using beads as the focusing reference . Filipin was imaged at two focal plates : offset : − 4 µ m and − 1 µ m , and the WCS was imaged without an offset . The images were then analysed usingaSpotDetectorBioapplication . PMcholesterolwasquantifiedusingtheimage with − 4 µ m offset where the fluorescence intensity was quantified within the ring region , and intracellular cholesterol was quantified using the image with − 1 µ m offsetwherethefluorescenceintensitywasquantifiedwithintheperinuclearcircularregion . Thetotalfluorescenceintensityofthespotsperobjectwithintheringregion was used to estimate cholesterol loss from the PM . In the scatter plot in Fig . 8b , the amount of intracellular cholesterol was estimated using the average intensity of the spotsidentifiedwithinthecircularregion . Foreachcondition1 , 400 – 9 , 000cellswere imaged in total in at least three independent experiments . Identificationoffunctionalclusters . The STRING database was used to identify known and predicted protein – protein interactions between the hits ( v8 . 3 ; ref . 13 ) . Only interactions with scores above 0 . 7 are reported here . Alexa 488 - labelledtransferrinuptakeassay . siRNA - transfected orBafA1 - treated cells were incubated in serum - free DMEM for 45min before a 7min pulse with Alexa 488 - labelled transferrin at 37 ◦ C . The cells were then washed and fixed ( 3 . 3 % formaldehyde , 15 min ) at 4 ◦ C , surface transferrin receptor was labelled using an Alexa 647 secondary antibody , and the DNA was stained with Hoechst . Fluorescence data were collected using the plate reader as described above . The Alexa 488 / Alexa 647 and Alexa 647 / Hoechst ratios were used as a measure of endocytosis efficiency and transferrinreceptoraccumulationatthecellsurfacerespectively . Fortheknockdown experiments , the ratios were normalized per experimental repeat by dividing by the mean value of the RISC - free control wells . For time - course experiments , triplicates within an experiment were averaged ( Alexa 488 / Hoechst and Alexa 647 / Hoechst ratios calculated for each well ) , and for each time point , the values from the BafA1 - treated wells were normalized to the mean of the wells treated with DMSO for the same length of time . The Alexa 488 / Alexa 647 ratios were then calculated by dividing the normalized values . 125 I - labelledtransferrinuptakeassay . The 125 I - transferrinuptakeassayhasbeen previously described 31 . Briefly , control and treated cells were pre - incubated on ice with 125 I - labelled transferrin in serum - free medium for 30min at 4 ◦ C , followed by incubations at 37 ◦ C for various times . The medium was collected , surface - bound transferrin was stripped with a low - pH wash , and the cells were extracted with 1M NaOH . Countswerequantifiedwithagammacounter . Thegraphsrepresentcounts associated with intracellular transferrin as a fraction of the total . Fluorescence microscopy . For FRAP experiments , the cells were transfected with clathrin light chain A – GFP , BafA1 - treated 2h post transfection , and imaged 24h later in CO 2 - independent medium ( Invitrogen ) with a Zeiss LSM710 microscope equipped with a temperature - controlled incubator ( 37 ◦ C ) . Fluorescence intensity data were collected in the bleach region ( ROI1 ) , a reference region within the same cell ( ROI2 ) andabackgroundregion ( ROI3 ) . Themeasurementswereperformedat 2sintervalsfor180s , withthebeachfollowingthefifthreadout . Bleachingresultedin anaveragelossof73and83 % offluorescenceintensityforcontrolandBafA1 - treated samples respectively . The data for ROI1 were corrected for the background and photobleaching ( F ROI1 − F ROI3 ) / ( F ROI2 − F ROI3 ) , the fluorescence intensity of the first post - bleach readout was subtracted from the measurements , and the results were divided by the average fluorescence intensity of the first five time points . Three independent experiments were performed ; in each from 9 to 18 cells per condition were analysed . For filipin staining , the cells were fixed for 30min in 3 . 3 % formaldehyde / PBS and incubated with filipin for 2h . Alexa 488 transferrin uptake for microscopy was performed for 7min at 37 ◦ C and the cells were fixed in 3 . 3 % formaldehyde for 15min . Images were acquired using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M wide - field fluorescence microscope equipped with a Roper Scientific CoolSNAP cf camera and a Plan - Apo × 63 / 1 . 4 oil - immersion lens using OpenLab software . The panels were assembled using Adobe Photoshop CS4 . NATURE CELL BIOLOGY © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved .

For thin - section electron microscopy , control , V - ATPase - depleted ( using ATP6V0C and ATP6V1B2 SMARTpools ) and BafA1 - treated ( 16h ) cells were fixed in tissue culture dishes and prepared for electron microscopy as previously described 30 . Ultrathin sections were cut , collected onto formvar / carbon - coated electron microscopy grids , and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate . The sections were observed in a Philips CM 100 transmission electron microscope ( Philips Electron Optics ) at 80kV . For quantitative analysis of the size of CCSs , micrographs were taken of cells sectioned perpendicular to the PM at a magnification of × 34 , 000 using a digital camera ( MegaviewIIITEM ; SoftImagingSystem ) . ForCCSsthatwereincontinuity with the PM , the depth of the pit and the width of the neck were measured , whereas for cross - sectioned CCSs ( within 250nm of the PM ) , two axes were measured using iTEM software . For each condition , at least 93 CCSs were scored . PM replicas . Control and BafA1 - treated cells ( 24h ) , with or without 12 . 5 µ gml − 1 cholesterol in the media , were grown on glass coverslips , washed in warm PBS , incubated for several seconds with polylysine in PBS and unroofed using sonication as described previously 67 , except that sonication was performed in warm Hank’s solution ( HBSS ) . The exposed PMs were immediately fixed in 2 % gluteraldehyde in 25mM HEPES , 125mM K - acetate , 50mM - Mg - acetate , at pH7 . 3 and further processed by critical point drying and rotary shadowing , as described previously 33 , and viewed in a Tecnai Spirit Biotwin 120keV transmission electron microscope ( FEI Company ) . The images were acquired with a Gatan Orius CCD ( charge - coupled device ) camera . pH measurements . For pH measurements , cells were transfected with pH constructs24hbeforebeingassayed . Thecellswerecollectedineither10 % FCS / PBS or pH buffers ( 15mM NaOH , 10mM PIPES , 10mM HEPES , 5mM glucose , 1mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 0 . 5mM MgSO 4 , 1mM CaCl 2 , 50mM KCl and 90mM potassium l - glutamate brought to the required pH using KCl or NaOH ) and analysed on the BD LSRFortessa ( BD Biosciences ) Flow Cytometer using a 488nm laser with 430 / 30 filters to excite SEpHluorin and a 561 nm laser with 610 / 20 filters to excite mCherry . Moderate expressors gated in the mCherry channel were selected for analysis . For quantification , mCherry and SEpHluorin were background - corrected , and the SEpHluorin / mCherry ratio was calculated ( using the derived parameter function in FlowJo Version 7 . 6 ) . Then the median values of the ratio from BafA1 - , DMSO - or pH - buffer - treated cells were normalized to untreated cells . A two - tailed , unpaired t - test was used to estimate statistical significance . Statistical methods .

Figure S2 Summary of the plate - wise data normalization steps ( a ) and graphs from a sample plate demonstrating data transformations ( b - d ) . The sum of the fluorescence of the 52 data points per well was calculated , and the resulting numbers were scaled by dividing by 100 , 000 ( CD8 , MHC - I ) or 1 , 000 , 000 ( DNA ) ( see Figure 2b ) . The average of three wells treated with Plk1 siRNAs was calculated and subtracted from the corresponding channels to normalise for the background ( b ) . The background - corrected values for the CD8 and MHC - I channels were divided by the Hoechst signal to normalise cell surface reporter fluorescence to cell number ( CD8 _ ratio ) ( c ) . Next , the average of the signal in the negative control wells was calculated and subtracted from the CD8 / Hoechst ratio , the average of the positive control values was calculated , and values obtained in the previous step were divided by the average of the wells with the SMARTpool targeting CLTC ( d ) . Thus , a phenotypic score with a value close to 1 indicates a phenotype similar to clathrin , and a score with a value close to 0 indicates no change in the cell surface expression of CD8 . These steps were repeated for each of the 1068 plates . In ( b , c , d ) a sample hit ( DNM2 ) and a SMARTpool with no phenotype ( DNASE1L1 ) are indicated on each of the plots . © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved .

( a ) CD8 / DNA fluorescence ratios of the control wells across the 267 screening plates with the CD8 - YXX Φ ( A _ CD8 _ ratio ) or CD8 - FXNPXY ( C _ CD8 _ ratio ) expressing cells before normalization . The wells are represented in the order in which the plates were scanned . Different types of technical variations are indicated : gradual drift of the controls during the screen ( black arrows ) , and unusually low values in a plate batch , caused by either lower staining efficiency ( decrease in both positive and negative controls , grey arrows ) or transfection efficiency ( decrease more obvious in positive controls , yellow arrow ) . The orange arrows indicate a new batch of cells .

( d ) The relationship between the normalized CD8 / Hoechst ratio and SSMD . Examples of two different library plates with the CD8 - YXX Φ expressing cells . After the CD8 / Hoechst ratios were normalised to the negative and positive ( CLTC ) controls , the normalized ratios were used to calculate the SSMD . The blue line indicates a theoretical position for the points , if the duplicates were identical ( SD = 0 ) . The points with large error bars deviate from the line and fall down the rank . The red points indicate knockdowns with cell numbers below the viability threshold , which due to low fluorescence readings do not yield reproducible ratios .
