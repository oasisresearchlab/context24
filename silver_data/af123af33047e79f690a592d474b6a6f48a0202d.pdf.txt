Introduction The availability of large scale data set and computational tools makes it easier than ever to quantitatively probe the science at diﬀerent scales , from papers ( Wang et al . , 2013 ; Hu et al . , 2020 ; Chen et al . , 2021a ; Mukherjee et al . , 2017 ) to individual scientists ( Way et al . , 2017 ; Liu et al . , 2018 ; Bu et al . , 2018 ; Zhang et al . , 2017 ) , and from research teams ( Wu et al . , 2019 ; Ma et al . , 2020 ; AlShebli et al . , 2018 ) to institutions and nations ( King , 2004 ; Liu et al . , 2020 ; Zhao et al . , 2020 ; Zuo & Zhao , 2018 ; Chen et al . , 2021c ; Huang et al . , 2020a ) . As the development of science is driven by scientists’ involvements in diﬀerent research topics , it is crucial to understand how they decide their research directions and what are the consequences of their collective decisions . Such choices aﬀect not only individual careers but also collectively shapes contemporary science . The conﬂict in topic choosing is vividly depicted as “The essential tension” ( Kuhn , 1977 ) that scientists often need to decide whether to explore a new ﬁeld or to exploit familiar topics ( Foster et al . , 2015 ) . By carefully selecting the control group or by comparing a group of elites with the average , quantitative studies have provided us with a consistent conclusion . Those who focus on a narrow research agenda tend to secure a steady scientiﬁc output and gain more overall citations ( Amjad et al . , 2018 ; Zeng et al . , 2019 ; Pramanik et al . , 2019 ) whereas those who take the risk to change topics are likely to produce “hit” papers or highly innovative out - comes ( Leahey et al . , 2017 ; Foster et al . , 2015 ; Azoulay et al . , 2011 ) . However , existing works usually focus on a group of selective individuals whose scien - tiﬁc achievements are beyond a certain threshold . It is still unclear what would happen to a typical scientist who crosses the boundary and enters a new ﬁeld . Moreover , the comparison is usually based on the overall perfor - mance and made between two distinct groups of individuals . The change of performance , measured by the past and current performance of one’s own , is rarely investigated . Here , we ask a set of simple but relatively unexplored questions : If one changes the research agenda and succeeds in the new ﬁeld , is she going to 2 publish better research works than she used to do ? Is she going to publish faster or slower compared with her past publication speed ? Furthermore , if she were to venture further , would her beneﬁts / disadvantages increase or decline ? These questions focusing on the change of the scientiﬁc perfor - mance of an individual are not fully addressed in existing works , to the best of our knowledge . We understand that individual scientists are inherently diﬀerent from each other , aﬀected by confounding factors such as scientiﬁc training ( Clauset et al . , 2015 ) , gender ( Maule´on & Bordons , 2006 ; Huang et al . , 2020b ) , age ( Jones & Weinberg , 2011 ; Petersen et al . , 2011 ) , mobility ( Robinson - Garcia et al . , 2019 ; Petersen , 2018 ; Zhao et al . , 2020 ) , prestige of institution in which they work ( Way et al . , 2019 ) , and more . While some factors can be controlled , many of them are hard to control . Therefore , we choose to use a large size of samples which may allow us to balance out other factors and reach preliminary answers to these questions . We use data about the publication in the American Physical Society ( APS ) journals and apply the approach by Jia et al . ( 2017 ) ; Aleta et al . ( 2019 ) to quantitatively measure the extent of research direction change . The method does not just provide a binary classiﬁcation that tells if a scientist changed the research direction or not . Instead , it gauges the distance between two vectors char - acterizing the topics of a paper set , giving rise to a continuous measure of the direction change . Using the publication records of over 14 , 000 scien - tists , we ﬁnd that the research direction change is positively correlated with the increase of impact : those with a bigger change in the research direction demonstrate not only a higher probability to increase citations of the publi - cations , but also the relative magnitude of the citation gain . In contrast , the relationship between the research direction change and productivity change is neutral . Scientists who stay on the same topic do not produce faster than their colleagues venturing into new areas . We observe similar patterns when varying the criteria of data ﬁltering , which supports the robustness of our conclusion . We also carefully compare our results with some recent ﬁndings . We provide evidence that the metric used in our study is totally uncorrelated with the one in Zeng et al . ( 2019 ) and the quality associated with the direc - tion change is also diﬀerent . Hence , the two studies quantify the eﬀects of direction change from two distinct perspectives . We compare the direction change with the diversity change of an individual’s research agenda ( Wang et al . , 2015 ; Leahey et al . , 2017 ) and ﬁnd that these two quantities are uncor - related . Therefore , the gain of citation is not from the beneﬁt of conducting 3 diverse or interdisciplinary research . We also control the ﬁeld citation and ﬁnd that our conclusion still holds . In other words , the positive correlation between direction change and impact change is not from the move to a hot ﬁeld . Taken together , we show the correlation between the research direc - tion change and the performance change among a large number of physicists , which advances our understanding of the career development of individual scientists . 2 . Materials and Methods 2 . 1 . Data set The APS data is publicly available at http : / / journals . aps . org / datasets , which consists of around 300 , 000 scientiﬁc papers authored by around 200 , 000 scientists together with their citation records covering years from 1976 to 2009 . The information includes a paper’s author list , its publication time , its reference list , and more . To classify papers belonging to each author , we perform the name disambiguation following procedures in previous works Deville et al . ( 2014 ) ; Zeng et al . ( 2019 ) ; Aleta et al . ( 2019 ) . The name disam - biguated data are roughly the same as one we used in another work Jia et al . ( 2017 ) . Still , some author names are so general that individual authors can hardly be distinguished . For this reason , we calculate the Shannon entropy of topics in an author’s publications and ﬁlter out those outliers who participate in unexpected highly diverse topics . We ﬁrst ﬁnd the topic vector g based on the all papers under one author ( see below for composing topic vector ) and then calculate Shannon entropy as H = (cid:80) 67 j = 1 − x j log ( x j ) where x j is the j th element of the vector g . Following Jia et al . ( 2017 ) , we set H = 2 . 5 as the cutoﬀ value . 2 . 2 . Composing topic vector We make use of the Physics and Astronomy Classiﬁcation Scheme ( PACS ) code ﬁrstly proposed by the American Institute of Physics in 1975 . The PACS code contains 6 digits in a format like “ab . cd . ef” that points to a speciﬁc and specialized area in physics . The order of these digits is related to the hierar - chical structure of the topics . For example , the code “82 . 39 . Rt” corresponds to “Reactions in complex biological systems” which is a subtopic under the ﬁrst level topic “82” : physical chemistry and chemical physics . Totally , there are 67 topics given by the ﬁrst two digits of the PACS code , representing 67 4 sub - disciplines in modern physics . Over 90 % of papers published after 1985 are labeled by one to three PACS codes . For each paper , we count the occurrence of the ﬁrst level topic given by the ﬁrst two digits of a PACS code . The number of occurrences is further normalized by the total number of PACS codes in a paper . Then for this paper , we can build a vector A = ( a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a j , . . . a 67 ) where the element a j is the fractionalized occurrence of each topic in this paper . For a set of m papers , we can average the m vectors of each paper and reach a topic vector g representing the weight coverage of 67 topics that the set of m papers demonstrates . If the m papers are authored by one scientist , the topic vector g then provides a good proxy of her research direction , capturing not only the collection of topics but also the level of involvements she studies in the m papers . An example of composing a topic vector is illustrated in Fig . 1a . 2 . 3 . Measuring the research direction change We sequence a scientist’s n papers according to their publication time . We then select two sets of papers , each with size m , in a scientist’s early and late career , from which we can build two topic vectors . Denote g i by the topic vector of the early publications and g f by the late publications . Comparing the diﬀerence between these two vectors allows us to quantify the degree of research direction change J o . Using cosine similarity , we have J o = 1 − g i · g f | | g i | | | | g f | | . ( 1 ) J o varies between 0 and 1 , where J o = 0 means the author studies the same topic in the early and late career with identical involvements , J o = 1 corresponds to the largest change as the topics in the two sets of papers have no overlap . To make sure that the results are not aﬀected by how the two sets of papers are selected , we consider two distinct scenarios . First , we select two series of m papers maximally separated in a scientist’s publication sequence , i . e . the ﬁrst and last m papers , capturing the change across the whole recorded career ( Fig . 1b ) . The corresponding direction change is denoted by J . As one publication sequence deﬁnes one unique career , we only have one measure of J for each author . 5 05 . 70 . −a 61 . 10 . Eq 68 . 08 .

For two topic tuples ( 66 , 68 ) and ( 05 , 61 , 68 ) , the element value in g of topic 66 is calculated as 1 / 2 + 0 2 = 14 , as it appears once in one topic tuple and is not included in the other . The element value in g of topic 68 is calculated as 1 / 2 + 1 / 3 2 = 512 , as it appears once in each of the topic tuples . Similarly , the element values in g of topic 05 and 61 are calculated as 0 + 1 / 3 2 = 16 . ( b ) The scenario that takes the ﬁrst and the last m papers in a scientist’s publication sequence to obtain the direction change J , its distribution P , the growth fraction and growth rate of the scientiﬁc impact and productivity P c , R c , P t , and R t . ( c ) The scenario that uses two adjacent sequences of m papers randomly chosen from a scientist’s publication sequence . Correspondingly , the quantities obtained are denoted by ˜ J , ˜ P , ˜ P c , ˜ R c , ˜ P t , and ˜ R t . Additionally , we also consider two consecutive sets of papers beginning at a random choosing paper to eliminate potential eﬀects caused by the gap between the two sets of publications ( Fig . 1c ) . The direction change measured is denoted by ˜ J . As an author may have published more than 2 m papers , there are multiple measures of ˜ J for each author . Therefore , for all measures associated with this scenario , we randomly pick a beginning paper for each author , get the measures needed ( such as ˜ J , ˜ P t and so on ) , and calculate the statistics across the population . Then we repeat this procedure 2000 times . We report the mean value and the error bar that corresponds to the standard deviation . Though the value and the exact distribution of J and ˜ J are diﬀerent , it is also noteworthy that the two quantities are highly correlated . The Pearson correlation between J and the average value (cid:104) ˜ J (cid:105) of an individual scientist is over 0 . 99 ( Fig . S1 ) . It implies that the big research direction change is likely carried out incrementally throughout one’s career . Due to the way we quantify the research direction change , only authors with no fewer than 2 m papers can be included in our analysis . In the main text , we report results based on m = 8 , corresponding to 14 , 726 scientists 6 who authored at least 16 papers . We repeat the same analysis with diﬀerent m values ( m = 7 and m = 9 , Section S2 ) . The same pattern is observed , suggesting that our ﬁndings do not depend on the choice of m . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Correlation between the direction change and impact change We apply two distinct approaches to quantify the impact change . First , we group scientists whose direction changes fall into a small range ( J ∈ ( 0 . 025 , 0 . 075 ] for instance ) and measure the percentage of scientists within this group whose research impact have increased . In particular , we count the number of citations a paper receives within two years after its publication and normalize this value by the average citations of papers published in the same year , giving rise to a normalized citation measure c 2 that takes into account the citation inﬂation ( Radicchi et al . , 2008 ; Sinatra et al . , 2016 ; Petersen et al . , 2019 ; Huang et al . , 2020b , c ) ( Section S1 ) . We then measure the average value of c 2 for the m papers in an author’s early and late publication list which is used to quantify research direction change . Denote ¯ c 2 , i and ¯ c 2 , f by the average citation of the two paper sets , respectively ( Figs . 1b - c ) . If an author’s late publications on average receive more citations than her early ones ( ¯ c 2 , f > ¯ c 2 , i ) , we consider this author’s research impact has increased . The percentage P c is then calculated as the ratio between the number of authors whose ¯ c 2 , f > ¯ c 2 , i and the number of authors whose direction change fall within the range ( J − 0 . 025 , J + 0 . 025 ] . For the direction change ˜ J , we obtain ˜ P c with a similar approach . The interpretation of these two measures of P c and ˜ P c can be rather intuitive : for those who choose to venture into a new topic , how many of them are going to produce better research works than they used to , and for those who choose to stay in the same ﬁeld , how many of them are able to keep the level of the scientiﬁc output ? Our results demonstrate a strong positive correlation between J and P c , as well as between ˜ J and ˜ P c , where the Pearson correlation coeﬃcient r 0 . 78 for J and 0 . 92 for ˜ J ( Figs . 2a - b ) . The positive correlation indicates that those who leave the current research ﬁeld are more likely to produce works of more impact than their previous work . More importantly , it also implies that the further one leaves the original area , the higher this likelihood will be . The P c and ˜ P c provide a binary check on whether or not an author’s works are on average better than her previous ones .

The dashed line represents the linear regression . ( b ) The average ˜ P c conditioning on the range ( ˜ J − 0 . 025 , ˜ J + 0 . 025 ] is positively correlated with ˜ J .

( d ) The average ˜ R c conditioning on the range ( ˜ J − 0 . 025 , ˜ J + 0 . 025 ] is positively correlated with ˜ J . At the boundary J = 0 and ˜ J = 0 , the range [ 0 , 0 . 05 ] is used , and the same boundary condition applies in all the analyses of J and ˜ J . The scatter plots of P c , ˜ P c , R c , and ˜ R c are displayed in Fig . S2 . The value of b is deﬁned as the slope of the corresponding linear regression function ( The dashed line ) . * * * p < 0 . 001 , * * p < 0 . 05 , * p < 0 . 1 ( t - test for Pearson coeﬃcient r ) . Error bars represent the one standard deviation of the mean . quantify the extent of the improvement or the decline . It could be the case , for example , that the gain is small but the loss is big associated with a certain direction change . For this reason , we measure the relative impact change ( ¯ c 2 , f − ¯ c 2 , i ) / ¯ c 2 , i , which quantiﬁes the extend that the impact of the later research diﬀers from the early ones . We calculate ( ¯ c 2 , f − ¯ c 2 , i ) / ¯ c 2 , i for each author and get the average value R c and ˜ R c of scientists with similar research direction change J and ˜ J , respectively ( for few scientists whose ¯ c 2 , i = 0 , we assign a default value 2 to their relative impact change ) . We again observe a strong and positive correlation between J and R c , as well as ˜ J and ˜ R c ( Figs . 2c - d ) . Taken together , those who exhibit a larger change of research 8 direction demonstrate a higher extend of impact improvement . The larger the change , the more impact the work would receive . A scientist may move to a “hot” ﬁeld where the publication’s average citation is higher than others . To explore if this can explain the positive correlation observed , we calculate the ﬁeld - normalized citation of each paper ( Section S3 ) . The positive correlation preserves when taking the diﬀerence of each ﬁeld into account . Finally , to make sure our results are not aﬀected by the sample sizes in calculating citations , we perform similar analyses using diﬀerent citation measures . Besides , we also test the case when the citation time window is 3 years . The corresponding results are presented in Section S4 . In all cases , a strong positive correlation is observed between the research direction change and the impact change . 3 . 2 . Correlation between the direction change and productivity change Another quantity associated with scientiﬁc performance is productivity , typically quantiﬁed by the time needed to complete a certain number of papers . Here we use the time interval t between the publications of the ﬁrst and m th paper in a given series of papers . Similar to the above analyses , we identify the fraction of scientists P t ( and ˜ P t ) whose productivity are increased ( t f < t i ) , and calculate the average change rate R t ( and ˜ R t ) of scientists’ productivity by averaging ( 1 t f − 1 t i ) / 1 t i of individual scientists whose research direction change are within the same range ( Figs . 1b - c ) . The direct correlation measure shows two seemingly contradictory pic - tures . On one hand , based on two adjacent sets of papers , the research direction change ˜ J is not correlated with the probability to increase produc - tivity ˜ P t ( Fig . 3a ) , nor the change of productivity rate ˜ R t ( Fig . S3a ) . On the other hand , if the change is measured based on two sets of papers that are at the two ends of a career , J is positively correlated with both P t ( Fig . 3b ) and R t ( Fig . S3b ) . Does it mean that switching to new topics at the latter career would associate with advanced productivity ? To have a right understanding of the correlation between J and P t as well as J and R t , we have to ﬁrst control their inherent correlation . As J depends on the two sets of papers that are maximally separated in one’s publication list , the more publications one produces , the less likely it that the publications on one end of the list would contain similar topics with those on the other end . Therefore , it is expected and also empirically conﬁrmed that J is positively correlated with the number of publications n in a career ( Fig . 3c ) . Furthermore , the growing number of publications may enrich 9 a scientist’s experiences , skills , and collaboration networks , which in return would beneﬁt productivity . It can be expected that the chance to surpass the publication rate at the beginning of the career ( which usually corresponds to the graduate training period ) would grow as one’s publication list gets longer . Indeed , we observe empirically that P t and R t are positively correlated with n ( Fig . 3d , and Fig . S3c ) . The positive correlation between J and n as well as P t and n leads to an inherent correlation between J and P t . In other words , given the way that J is measured and the various values of the hidden variable n , J is expected to correlate with P t . Indeed , if we control the number of papers by focusing on 16 ≤ n ≤ 20 or 21 ≤ n ≤ 25 , the correlation disappears ( Section S5 ) . To control this inherent correlation , we can ﬁrst identify the dependence between J and P t from their pairwise dependence with n ( Section S6 ) . The result gives P t ∼ b × J , which is the expected dependence between J and P t ( red line in Fig . 3b ) . We then subtract the increase from P t , yielding a measure P (cid:48) t = P t − b × J in which P t ’s natural dependence with J is excluded . When the inherent correlation is properly controlled , we ﬁnd that P (cid:48) t and J are uncorrelated ( Fig . 3e ) . The same analyses can also be performed on R t , which leads to similar results ( Fig . S3d ) . Taken together , by properly control the eﬀect of publication number n in our measure , we reach consistent results that the research direction change is not correlated with the probability to increase productivity nor the average change rate of productivity . This is contrary to our common perception that changing research direction is likely to hurt productivity . But we have to keep in mind that there may be a survivor bias . A scientist can contribute to the statistics only when she successfully changes the direction . Those who take the risk to explore a new area but fail to publish enough are not included in our data . Therefore , the interpretation of the results needs more caution . Finally , the hidden variable n leads us to two contradictory relationships because it strongly and positively correlates with P t as well as R t . In terms of impact change analyzed in the above section , we ﬁnd that n is weakly and slightly negatively correlated with P c and R c ( Fig . S4 ) . This is in line with some previous ﬁndings that simply publishing a lot does not necessarily enhance the scientiﬁc impact of individual papers ( Hanssen & Jørgensen , 2015 ; Larivi ` ere & Costas , 2016 ; Sarewitz , 2016 ; Kolesnikov et al . , 2018 ) . Therefore , although the dependence between J and n preserves , it does not play a role in our conclusion about impact change . 10 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 . 50 0 . 55 0 . 60 0 . 65 0 . 70 0 . 75 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 . 64 0 . 66 0 . 68 0 . 70 0 . 72 0 . 74 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 0 . 55 0 . 60 0 . 65 0 . 70 0 . 75 0 . 80 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 . 63 0 . 66 0 . 69 r = 0 . 28 b = 0 . 0113 P t J r = 0 . 66 b = 0 . 0542 P t J r = 0 . 92 b = 10 . 94 n J r = 0 . 87 b = 0 . 0048 P t n r = 0 . 02 b = 0 . 0013 P ' t J a b c d e ~ ~ Figure 3 : ( a ) ˜ P t is not correlated with ˜ J for a range of values ( 0 ≤ ˜ J ≤ 0 . 725 ) with over 97 % of the sample size and small standard deviations . Due to the relatively small sample size ( no more than 100 ) and high standard deviation for each group of J in the range ( 0 . 725 < ˜ J ≤ 1 . 0 ) , we do not take this range into discussion . ( b ) P t increases with J , the slope of which is almost the same as the one predicted by the correlations between P t and n as well as n and J ( Section S6 ) . ( c ) The average output n conditioning on the range of direction change ( J − 0 . 025 , J + 0 . 025 ] is positively correlated with J . ( d ) P t is positively correlated with the output n .

Extended discussions It is a conventional narrative that scientiﬁc productivity tends to grow rapidly at the early stage of a career and then slowly declines . Such narrative is highlighted in some recent studies ( Sinatra et al . , 2016 ; Li et al . , 2020 ) explaining why elite scientists tend to produce the most signiﬁcant works at their early career stage : because their productivity declines when they get older . This pattern seems to be against our ﬁnding that P t and n are positively correlated , which plays a crucial role in explaining the discrepancy in the initial results of the productivity change . Indeed , if we are not only interested in elite scientists , the productivity change can be diverse and the jump - decline pattern is not the only typical one ( Way et al . , 2017 ) . Even in the work that implies a jump - decline pattern , we can still observe in the vast majority that the productivity declines at the very early career ( typical schooling and training period ) followed by a steady increase as the career unfolds ( Fig . 1E in Sinatra et al . ( 2016 ) ) . For a typical scientist , it may hold that the productivity at the end of the career , though has declined from the peak , is still higher than when she starts the career . Indeed , when we turn to a more comprehensive data set by the Web of Science , we still observe P t ( R t ) and n are positively correlated ( Figs . S5a - b ) . Another potentially important factor is the career length , which is not controlled in the above analyses . Therefore , those who are on the rising stage may outnumber those in the gloaming . Nevertheless , when the career length is controlled , the same positive correlation remains ( Figs . S5c - d ) . Moreover , the study by Sinatra et al . ( 2016 ) and Liu et al . ( 2018 ) suggest that the work with the highest impact may appear randomly in one’s publication sequence . But this pattern is not contradictory to the positive correlation between the direction change and impact change , which implies that the work with the highest impact may appear in the later career . The “random impact rule” by Sinatra et al . ( 2016 ) ; Liu et al . ( 2018 ) is based on all samples without any control , whereas the correlation measured is conditioned on a certain research direction change . Another work we wish to discuss more is the recent advances by Zeng et al . ( 2019 ) which also utilizes the APS data to quantify topic change patterns of scientists . In this pioneering work , the authors measure the probability to switch between topics in an individual career . The results demonstrate that compared with typical scientists , the top 10 % of productive scientists have a lower switching probability in the early career and higher switching prob - ability in the later career . Moreover , the top 10 % most cited scientists have an overall lower switching probability than normal scientists . The relation - 12 ship discovered seems contradictory to our ﬁndings . However , as a matter of fact , our work and the work by Zeng et al . ( 2019 ) are diﬀerent in terms of the quantiﬁcation of the direction change and the quality that the change is associated with . Hence , the two conclusions can be both valid . First , in this work , we are interested in the change of performance , not the performance itself . In other words , we investigate how likely a scien - tist can publish works with more impact or within less time as the career develops , regardless if she is in the top 10 % elite group or not . The focus , and consequently the ﬁndings are diﬀerent from that in Zeng et al . ( 2019 ) . More importantly , the switching probability quantiﬁes the likelihood that the current topic would be diﬀerent from the subsequent one , which only depends on the topic of two papers . The direction change applied in this study compares the averaged topics of two sets of papers . Therefore , they reﬂect two distinct aspects in an individual’s research topic selection . As an example , assume a scientist who has published 16 papers within which the ﬁrst 8 papers are on topic A and the next 8 are on topic B . The direction change J of this scientist would be 1 , as she explores totally diﬀerent topics in the early and late sets of publications . The switching probability , however , is very low because this scientist only switches the topic once , which occurs in the 9th paper . Likewise , assume another scientist who has also published 16 papers on either topic A or topic B . She publishes following a pattern that if her current publication is on topic A , then the next paper will be on topic B , and vice versa . In this case , the direction change J would be 0 as this scientist equally devotes herself to topics A and B throughout the career . But the switching probability would be very high as she constantly switches the topic . The two examples vividly depict the diﬀerence between these two measures . Indeed , when we try to associate a scientist’s direction change and switching probability together , we ﬁnd that they two are independent of each other ( Figs . 4a - b ) . Therefore , we believe that this work and the work by Zeng et al . ( 2019 ) are complementary rather than contradictory . As they reveal two essential patterns underlying the scientiﬁc careers of individuals , it would be interesting to check in future studies if a combination of they two is a more comprehensive predictor for an individual career . 13 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 - 2 - 1 0 1 2 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 - 1 . 0 - 0 . 5 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 r = 0 . 11 b = 0 . 0178 J Switching Probability r = 0 . 13 b = 0 . 0134 < J > Switching Probability r = 0 . 00 b = 0 . 0045 H J r = - 0 . 19 b = - 0 . 0356 H J ~ a b c d Figure 4 : ( a ) For each scientist , we plot her J versus switching probability ( grey circle ) , and the mean value of J conditioning on the range of ( switching probability - 0 . 025 , switching probability + 0 . 025 ] ( scatter with line ) . The result shows that switching probability is not correlated with J on the individual level ( p > 0 . 1 ) . ( b ) For each scientist , we calculate the average value (cid:104) ˜ J (cid:105) of her n − 1 ˜ J . Then we plot her (cid:104) ˜ J (cid:105) versus switching probability ( grey circle ) , and the mean value of (cid:104) ˜ J (cid:105) conditioning on the range of ( switching probability - 0 . 025 , switching probability + 0 . 025 ] ( scatter with line ) . The result shows that switching probability is not correlated with (cid:104) ˜ J (cid:105) at the individual level ( p > 0 . 1 ) . ( c ) For scientists whose impact has increased ( ¯ c 2 , f > ¯ c 2 , i ) , we plot their J versus the change of Shannon entropy ∆ H ( grey circle ) . The result shows that ∆ H and J are not correlated ( p > 0 . 1 ) . The average ∆ H is close to 0 , indicating that diversity change is not associated with the impact increase . ( d ) Similar to ( c ) , but the mean value of ∆ H is taken for individuals with ( J − 0 . 025 , J + 0 . 025 ] . The value of b is deﬁned as the slope of the corresponding linear regression function ( The dashed line ) . Error bars represent the one standard deviation of the mean . Finally , we also wish to point out that our ﬁnding is diﬀerent from that on research diversity , though they both suggest a positive citation gain ( Alfredo et al . , 2015 ; Chen et al . , 2015 , 2021b ; Leahey et al . , 2017 ) . Indeed , the direction change and diversity change are two diﬀerent things . Take the above example again , a scientist who has published the ﬁrst 8 papers on topic A and the next 8 papers on topic B . The direction change is 1 . But the diversity change is 0 , as she always focuses on one topic only . Another 14 example is when a scientist only focuses on topic A at the beginning and then changes the agenda with 80 % of topic A and ﬁve other topics each with 4 % of weight . As the main focus is still on topic A , the direction is very small . But because there are ﬁve other topics added to the agenda , the diversity change is high . Here , we use Shannon entropy to quantify the diversity of one’s research agenda as H = (cid:80) 67 j = 1 − x j log ( x j ) where x j is the j th element of the vector g ( the other two types of diversity index are reported in Section S7 ) . We focus on scientists whose impact has increased ( ¯ c 2 , f > ¯ c 2 , i ) and plot their change of entropy ∆ H with their change of research direction . We ﬁnd these two quantities are not correlated ( Figs . 4c - d and Fig . S15 ) . The fact that the change of diversity is close to 0 on average indicates that the increased impact is not from a more interdisciplinary or more narrow research agenda . Instead , it is likely a result of bringing existing expertise to the new ﬁeld and solving the ﬁeld problem by a new approach . 4 . Conclusions To summarize , by utilizing PACS codes to classify topics in physics pub - lications , we quantify the degree of the research direction change in an in - dividual career . Instead of considering the overall scientiﬁc performance , we associate this direction change of an individual with her change of per - formance . On one hand , we ﬁnd that the direction change is strongly and positively correlated with the change of impact . Those who demonstrate a larger change on research topics are more likely to receive more citations than they used to . The magnitude of the relative improvement also tends to be higher . On the other hand , the direction change is not correlated with the productivity change . The likelihood that one increases or decreases pro - ductivity may be associated with many factors in an individual career , but the change of research direction alone is not associated with it . We perform supplementary analyses to demonstrate the robustness of the conclusion . We also discuss in detail the diﬀerence between our ﬁndings and others’ . Our study provides another point of view not fully captured in previous studies . The statistics provide an encouraging prediction for scientists who venture into a new ﬁeld . Once they are established in the new ﬁeld , they are likely to become better scientists . What is not mentioned , however , is the risk associated with the direction change ( Bromham et al . , 2016 ; Azoulay et al . , 2011 ; Foster et al . , 2015 ; Goldstein & Kearney , 2020 ) . Indeed , our analyses are based on scientists who have published enough papers in the new ﬁeld . 15 Those who try to change but fail to have the new research published are not included . This naturally poses a survival bias in the result , which motivates further studies on failures across a career ( Yin et al . , 2019 ; Wang et al . , 2019b ) . There are also many factors that the correlation measure alone can not explain . For example , a scientist may be forced to leave the old ﬁeld because it shrinks and can not yield interesting results , and another scientist ﬁnds a way to combine her prior knowledge with the new problem which leads to fruitful results ( Pramanik et al . , 2019 ) . In both cases , a citation gain and a direction change would be observed . Yet , in the current study we can not distinguish them nor identify which causes the other . Given confounding factors in an individual career , it is diﬃcult but important to check other explanations of the observation . Moreover , our study is based on APS publication data . Despite the intensive usage ( Liu et al . , 2017 ; Chinazzi et al . , 2019 ) , this data set only covers a small part of the science . The classiﬁcation scheme provided by the PACS code has certain limitations as well . Given the availability of large scale data sets , such as Microsoft Academic Graph ( Wang et al . , 2020 ) and advances in machine learning tools to identify and classify topics from papers ( Qian et al . , 2020 ; Chinazzi et al . , 2019 ; Palmucci et al . , 2020 ; Shen et al . , 2019 ) , it would be important to check if similar patterns can be observed in other data set . Finally , we adopt the whole counting in this study that gives equal credit to all co - authors . This approach may lead to inﬂation when calculating the impact of a scientist’s work and her productivity ( Huang et al . , 2011 ; Yu et al . , 2021 ) . It may be worthwhile to try other counting or credit allocation method ( Sivertsen et al . , 2019 ; Shen & Barab´asi , 2014 ; Wang et al . , 2019a ) .

Citation normalization We consider the raw citations received within 2 years after publishing , c 2 , raw , as a publication’s scientiﬁc impact . To compare the impact of papers published at diﬀerent time periods , we normalize the c 2 , raw of each publica - tion by the average (cid:104) c 2 , raw (cid:105) of the publishing year and multiplying by 10 , as c 2 = c 2 , raw (cid:104) c 2 , raw (cid:105) ∗ 10 utilized in the main text , where 10 is an arbitrary constant that has no quantitative eﬀect to our investigations but restores the citation quantity c 2 to a relatively realistic value . Hence , the consequent c 2 provides a rational and comparable measure of scientiﬁc impact across years . 28 S2 . Results based on the choices of m As m = 8 is taken into account in our analysis in the main text , we also investigate other cases when m = 7 and m = 9 .

Impact change based on ﬁeld - normalized citation By allocating the citation c p 2 , raw of a paper to each PACS code i it contains through fractional counting method as c i 2 , raw = c p 2 , raw ∗ f i , where f i represents the fraction of PACS code i in a paper , we obtain the yearly average citation (cid:104) c i 2 , raw (cid:105) of PACS code i , and ﬁnd that the (cid:104) c i 2 , raw (cid:105) of diﬀerent PACS codes can be very diﬀerent ( Fig . S8 ) . After obtaining the yearly average citation (cid:104) c i 2 , raw (cid:105) of each PACS code , we calculate the ﬁeld citation of a paper by c p 2 , portfolio = (cid:80) i (cid:104) c i 2 , raw (cid:105) ∗ f i , which represents a paper’s weighted citation as a combination of the yearly average citation of each PACS code it contains . We then normalize the c p 2 , raw by c p 2 , portfolio and multiplying by 10 , as c p 2 = c p 2 , raw c p 2 , portfolio ∗ 10 . We perform the same analyses using the ﬁeld - normalized citation and ﬁnd the same patterns ( Fig . S9 ) . Therefore , the increased impact is not because scientists tend to move to a hot ﬁeld . 1 9 8 0 1 9 8 5 1 9 9 0 1 9 9 5 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 5 0 2 4 6 8 1 0 1 2 1 4 < c i 2 , r a w > y e a r P A C S c o d e 4 2 6 1 7 4 7 5 Figure S8 : We allocate the citation to each PACS code of a paper by fractional counting to obtain the ﬁeld - normalized citation of each paper .

Measuring ¯ c 2 , i and ¯ c 2 , f As the data set contains citation information by the year 2009 , only papers published by 2007 receive the full c 2 after the publication . ¯ c 2 , i and ¯ c 2 , f are calculated based on the papers published by 2007 in the two paper sets . As scientists who have no qualiﬁed paper in the second paper set are excluded , the sample size shrinks from 14 , 726 originally to 13 , 170 . It is possible for a scientist that the number of the qualiﬁed papers in the second paper set is less than m , but m qualiﬁed papers in the ﬁrst paper set , as papers are sequenced by the publication date . Hence ¯ c 2 , i and ¯ c 2 , f may be based on diﬀerent sample sizes . In the relationship between P c ( R c ) and J in the main text , ¯ c 2 , i is based on m papers and ¯ c 2 , f is based on the number of the qualiﬁed papers in the second paper set . To overcome the issue of diﬀerent sample sizes , we take a diﬀerent measurement in the relationship between ˜ P c ( ˜ R c ) and ˜ J in the main text . If the number m (cid:48) of the qualiﬁed papers in the second paper set is less than m , we randomly choose m (cid:48) papers in the ﬁrst paper set to calculate ¯ c 2 , i . To make sure our conclusion is not aﬀected by the diﬀerence in the sample size , we apply some other variations as listed below . In all cases , positive correlations are observed . 1 . For the relationship between P c and J , if the number of the qualiﬁed papers in the second paper set ( m (cid:48) ) is less than m ( m = 8 ) , we randomly choose m (cid:48) papers in the ﬁrst paper set to calculate ¯ c 2 , i , which is then used to compare with ¯ c 2 , f to calculate P c . As P c here depends on the choice of random samples for ¯ c 2 , i , we repeat the measurement 1000 times to obtain the mean and standard deviation . This is to make sure that the positive correlation is not aﬀected by diﬀerent sample sizes in calculating ¯ c 2 , i and ¯ c 2 , f . The result is shown in Fig . S10a . 2 . To make sure the positive correlation between ˜ P c and ˜ J is not aﬀected by the small sample size for ¯ c 2 , f , we only consider the samples with the number of the qualiﬁed papers ( m (cid:48) ) in the second paper set satisfying m (cid:48) ≥ m / 2 . The result is shown in Fig . S10b . 3 . For the relationship between P c and J , we only consider the scientists who have no less than 2 m papers by the year 2007 and calculate the P c and J based on papers published by 2007 . In this case , the sample size for ¯ c 2 , i and ¯ c 2 , f are the same . The result is shown in Fig . S10c . 4 . To make sure the results are not aﬀected by the cutoﬀ year , we perform a similar measurement as that in 3 . But we consider scientists who have equal or greater than 2 m papers by the year 2006 . P c and J are calculated based 34 on papers published by 2006 . The result is shown in Fig . S10d . 5 . Scientiﬁc impact based on c 3 . Originally we count citations received within 2 years of the publications . To make sure our results are not aﬀected by the choice of the 2 - year time window , we also consider citations received within 3 years of the publications . Correspondingly we focus on scientists who have n ≥ 2 m papers and whose last m papers contain at least one paper published by 2006 , and the qualiﬁed population shrinks to 11 , 584 . We perform the same measurements as in the main text for this case and the results are shown in Figs . S10e - f . 6 . We repeat the above 5 measurements for growth rate R c and ˜ R c ( Fig .

Results conditioning on the output n By sampling authors into the range ( n − 2 . 5 , n + 2 . 5 ] of publication output n , we ﬁnd the ranges ( 15 , 20 ] and ( 20 , 25 ] contain the top 2 largest population , corresponding to groups of scientists who on average published 17 . 5 and 22 . 5 papers in her career ( Fig . S12 ) . By conditioning on scientists whose outputs n fall into the region ( 15 , 20 ] and ( 20 , 25 ] respectively , we observe the ﬂat relationship between P t ( and R t ) and J , conﬁrming our conclusions in the main text that the dependence of P t ( and R t ) to J is mainly driven by the hidden variable n in the scenario of the measurement of J .

Correlation between scientiﬁc performance and J caused by n We assume the linear dependency between n and J , as well as between P t and n . The relationship between n and J can be found via linear regression as z = 28 . 96 + 10 . 943 x ( Fig . 3c ) . The relationship between P t and n is y = 0 . 5304 + 0 . 0048 z ( Fig . 3d ) . By combining both equations , we obtain the relationship between P t and J as y = 0 . 6694 + 0 . 0525 x , which has almost the same slop as that in the main text ( Fig . 3b ) . It conﬁrms that changing research interest alone does not hurt the growth fraction of productivity and the increasing trend is solely caused by the hidden variable n . Similarly , for results when m = 7 , we have y = 0 . 5088 + 0 . 0056 z for relationship between P t and n as well as z = 26 . 183 + 10 . 385 x for n and J , giving rise to y = 0 . 6554 + 0 . 0582 x . For results when m = 9 , we have y = 0 . 5353 + 0 . 0047 z for relationship between P t and n as well as z = 31 . 638 + 11 . 95 x for n and J , giving rise to y = 0 . 6840 + 0 . 0562 x . When it comes to the linear dependency between R t and n as well as n and J . As well , the relationship between n and J is z = 28 . 96 + 10 . 943 x ( Fig . 3c ) . The relationship between R t and n is y = 0 . 1952 + 0 . 0300 z ( Fig . S3c ) . By combining both equations , we obtain the relationship between R t and J as y = 1 . 0641 + 0 . 3283 x , which is a little bigger than the slop in the Fig . S3b ) . It conﬁrms that changing research interest alone does not hurt the growth rate of productivity and the increasing trend is solely caused by the hidden variable n . Similarly , for results when m = 7 , we have y = 0 . 1774 + 0 . 0347 z for relationship between R t and n as well as z = 26 . 183 + 10 . 385 x for n and J , giving rise to y = 1 . 0860 + 0 . 3604 x . For results when m = 9 , we have y = 0 . 1376 + 0 . 0285 z for relationship between R t and n as well as z = 31 . 638 + 11 . 95 x for n and J , giving rise to y = 1 . 0393 + 0 . 3406 x . 40 S7 . Measuring the diversity change We adopted two more types of diversity index to measure the diversity change of a scientist’s topic vectors ( Table S1 ) . As a higher Gini index indicates a higher level of inequality and a lower level of diversity , so we applied 1 – Gini in our analysis to represent the diversity . In addition , the Simpson index is widely used to measure the topic diversity , which captures both variety and balance of topics . The Simpson index formulated as (cid:80) nj = 1 x 2 j is negatively associated with diversity , where x j represents the fractionalized occurrence of j th PACS code in the topic vector g . Thus , we adopted 1 − (cid:80) nj = 1 x 2 j to characterize the topic diversity . Table S1 : Diversity Measures Measure Description 1 - Gini G = 1 − (cid:80) nj = 1 ( 2 j − n − 1 ) · x j n (cid:80) nj = 1 x j Simpson index S = 1 − (cid:80) nj = 1 x 2 j * The number n of distinct PACS codes equals to 67 , and x j represents the fraction of j th PACS code in the the topic vector g . 41 We focus on scientists whose impact has increased and measure the diver - sity change of each individual . The results show that the scatters of diversity change are evenly distributed at both sides of y = 0 , and diversity change is uncorrelated with direction change ( Fig . S15 ) . The fact that the change of diversity is close to 0 on average indicates that the increased impact is not from a more diverse or more narrow research agenda . Therefore , our ﬁnding is diﬀerent from studies on interdisciplinary research . 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 - 0 . 15 - 0 . 10 - 0 . 05 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 - 0 . 04 - 0 . 02 0 . 00 0 . 02 0 . 04 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 - 1 . 0 - 0 . 5 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 - 0 . 4 - 0 . 2 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 G J G J r = - 0 . 02 b = - 0 . 0127 S J r = - 0 . 06 b = - 0 . 0006 r = 0 . 02 b = 0 . 0015 r = - 0 . 40 b = - 0 . 0263 S J a b c d Figure S15 : For scientists whose impact has increased ( ¯ c 2 , f > ¯ c 2 , i ) , we plot their J versus two types of diversity index , ∆ G and ∆ S respectively . ( a ) The result shows that ∆ G and J are not correlated ( p > 0 . 1 ) . The average ∆ G is close to 0 , indicating that diversity change is not associated with the impact increase . ( b ) Similar to ( a ) , but the mean value of ∆ G is taken for individuals with ( J − 0 . 025 , J + 0 . 025 ] . ( c ) As well , ∆ S and J are not correlated ( p > 0 . 1 ) , and the average ∆ S is close to 0 . ( d ) Similar to ( c ) , but the mean value of ∆ S is taken for individuals with ( J − 0 . 025 , J + 0 . 025 ] . The value of b is deﬁned as the slope of the corresponding linear regression function . Error bars represent the one standard deviation of the mean . 42
