Among others , it regulates embryogenesis , tissue regeneration and tumor growth . Therefore , understanding and controlling cell migration represent fundamental challenges in science . Specifically , the ability of cells to follow stiffness gradients , known as durotaxis , is ubiquitous across most cell types . Even so , certain cells fol - low positive stiffness gradients while others move along negative gradients . How the physical mechanisms involved in cell migration works to enable a wide range of durotactic responses is still poorly understood . Here , we provide a mechanistic rationale of durotaxis by integrating stochastic clutch models for cell adhesion with an active gel theory of cell migration . We show that positive and negative durotaxis found across cell types are explained by asymmetries in the cell adhesion dynamics . We rationalize durotaxis by an asymmetric mechanotransduction in the cell adhesion behavior that further polarizes the intracellular retrograde flow and the protruding velocity at the cell membrane . Our theoretical framework confirms previous experimental ob - servations and explains positive and negative durotaxis . Moreover , we show how durotaxis can be engineer to manipulate cell migration , which has important implications in biology , medicine and bioengineering .

It determines fundamental biological processes such as embryonic development , tissue regeneration , wound healing or tumor invasion . Cells move guided by exogenous chemical [ 50 , 21 ] , electrical [ 30 , 7 ] and mechanical signals in - vivo and in - vitro [ 45 , 49 , 6 , 51 ] , known as chemotaxis , electrotaxis and durotaxis . During decades , there have been tremendous efforts to understand how cells organize themselves to follow these stimuli . There is also an increasing interest in controlling cell migration through external cues because it may allows us to propose strategies to arrest tumor progression [ 14 , 57 , 4 ] , boost tissues regeneration [ 13 , 42 ] and to design biomimetic materials [ 27 , 53 ] . Durotaxis [ 49 , 11 , 45 ] represents a universal mode of directed cell migration across cell types . Among others , fibroblasts [ 28 ] and smooth muscle cells [ 54 ] migrate toward positive gradients of the the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , while others , e . g . neurons [ 25 ] or cancer cells [ 47 ] , migrate toward negative gradients . These are referred to as positive and negative durotaxis , respectively . A stiffness gradient in the ECM exposes cells to a differential rigidity that they sense , transduce and integrate into intracellular responses . Experimental evidences showed dependences on the stiffness gradient [ 18 , 25 , 48 ] and on the absolute stiffness value in which cells migrate [ 8 , 48 ] . However , there is a lack of physical understanding of durotaxis across cell scales that could help us to rationalize durotaxis . Among other insights , this could allow us to understand why some cells express positive durotaxis while others migrate down the stiffness gradient . Recent experimental work , in combination with clutch models , have shown the first evidences of how cell adhesion is implicated in these opposed durotactic responses [ 19 ] . As for any cell migration mode [ 56 , 3 ] , durotaxis should be driven by a competition of a continuous polymerization of actin filaments that protrudes the cell membrane forward [ 12 , 44 , 55 ] and an inward retrograde flow generated by the contractile forces that myosin motors exert on the F - actin network [ 35 , 37 ] ( Fig . 1 ) . Balancing these two forces , adhesion complexes ( ACs ) establish cell attachements to their surroundings through a large number of cell adhesion molecules ( CAMs ) [ 36 , 52 ] . At some point during the motility process , the formation of a cell front orients the cell toward positive or negative stiffness gradients . Here , we integrate active gel models with stochastic clutch models for cell adhesion to reveal how durotaxis works . Cells read differences in the ECM stiffness through CAMs and regulate the ACs dynamics accordingly [ 38 , 22 , 52 , 36 ] . Therefore , durotaxis must be first activated by the mechanotransduction of the substrate stiffness . Then , the striking durotactic modes found across cell types must be due to a differential expression of adhesion dynamics . Under this rationale , we explore how the cell adhesion can be manipulated to arrest or enhance durotaxis , and to switch from positive to negative durotaxis , and vice - versa . Figure 1 : Sketch of the main forces acting in cell migration . A contractile acto - myosin flow , ( black ) , competes with protrusive forces at the leading ( red ) and rear ( blue ) edges of the cell . At the cell - ECM interface , a friction - like force ap - pears as a result of adhesion mechanisms . 2 2 Model 2 . 1 Clutch model of cell adhesion To model the adhesion dynamics , we adopt previous clutch models ( see [ 5 , 15 , 10 ] for details ) . The clutch hypothesis considers a contractile acto - myosin network that pulls on the CAMs bound to the ECM . Different cell types respond to the intracellular pulling forces in different ways because cells express specific types of CAMs . Some cells , e . g . neurons [ 5 ] , express slip bonds : the life - time of the bond decreases exponentially as the force increases . Other cells , such as fibroblasts , express catch bonds , that is the lifetime first increases and then decreases exponentially with force . To consider these differences and the specific adhesion dynamics , the clutch model considers that a number of molecular clutches binds to the ECM with a constant rate k on , and unbinds with a dissociation rate k ∗ off , that depends on force as k ∗ off = k offs e ( F c / F slipb ) + k offc e ( − F c / F catchb ) . ( 1 ) The first term in Eq . 1 alone , represents a slip bond . k offs and k offc and F slip b and F catchb are the unloaded dissociation rates and the characteristic bond rupture forces in the slip and catch pathways respectively . F c is force per molecular clucth . Some cells also show a reinforcement mechanism when the talin rod unfolds and vinculin binds to the unfolded domains , which promotes the increase of integrin density . Consequently , the traction forces that the cell exerts on the ECM rises [ 10 ] . The clutch model predicts the actin velocity , ˆ v , and tractions , P , as a function of the ECM stiffness ( Fig . 2 ) . We focus here on cells expressing slip bonds , as a case of non - reinforced bonds , and cells expressing reinforced catch bonds ( all model parameters are in Table SI ) . 2 . 2 Minimal active gel model for cell migration To explore the role of the adhesion mechanics in cell migration , we build a minimal active gel model for cell migration [ 41 ] . We consider a 1D domain , Ω , with moving coordinates x ( t ) ∈ [ l r ( t ) , l f ( t ) ] . l r ( t ) and l f ( t ) represents the rear and front boundaries of the cell and , therefore , the cell length is determined as L ( t ) = l f ( t ) − l r ( t ) ( Fig . 1 ) , where f and r indicate the front and rear of the cell . We model the mechanics of the acto - myosin network as a contractile viscous gel , that represents the retrograde flow , in contact with the ECM [ 40 , 43 , 41 , 31 , 1 ] . We assume that viscous forces dominate the elastic forces and that inertial forces are negligible . Therefore , the balance of linear momentum for the active gel is ∂ x σ F = ηv F , where σ F = µ F ∂ x v F + ζρ F ρ M ( 2 ) is the constitutive relation of the network stress , which accounts for the viscosity of the actin network and the myosin contractility , respectively . The right hand side of the balance of linear momentum represents the friction between the network flow and the ECM , with friction parameter η . v F is the velocity of the retrograde flow , µ F is the shear viscosity , ζ the active contraction exerted by the myosin motors and ρ M and ρ F are the densities of myosin motors and F - actin , respectively ( see details below ) . We impose zero stresses on the cell boundaries so that there are not pushing or pulling forces on the network , which allows us to compute the resulting retrograde flow at the cell boundaries . A second differentiated actin network polymerizes against the membrane [ 39 , 37 ] , which in - creases the membrane tension and , in turn , reduces the polymerization velocity [ 12 , 44 ] . Filaments grow freely with velocity v p 0 = k pon δ if there is no opposing force to it [ 32 ] . k pon is the rate of actin assembly and δ is the size of one single monomer at the tip of the filament . When the membrane tension increases , the actin polymerization decreases as v p = v p 0 [ 1 − τ ( L ( t ) / τ stall ] z [ 32 , 26 , 23 ] , 3 where τ stall is a tension required to stall the polymerization of the actin network and z is a model parameter that controls the velocity decay . We assume that actin polymerization is symmetric and v p is equal at both sides of the cell . The membrane tension , τ , follows a simple Hookean law such that τ ( L ( t ) ) = k ( L ( t ) − L b ) , where k is the spring constant and L b = L 0 + L r accounts for the resting length , L 0 , and the buffer membrane length L r in reservoirs and foldings of the cell membrane . Therefore , membrane tension starts to increase once all reservoirs and membrane folds have flatten , i . e L ( t ) > L b . We assume zero compressive stresses when L ( t ) < L b . The outward polymerization velocities , v pr , f , compete against the cell membrane with the inward retrograde flow velocity v Fr , f to expand or retract the cell rear and front of the cell with velocity ˙ l r , f ( t ) = v pr , f − v F | r , f , respectively ( Fig . 1 ) . Then , we compute the cell migration velocity as v = ( ˙ l r ( t ) + ˙ l f ( t ) ) / 2 . The distribution of the F - actin density , ρ F ( x , t ) , is modeled as ∂ t ρ F + ∂ x ( wρ F − D F ∂ x ρ F ) = k p − k d ρ F ( 3 ) where the right hand side includes the polymerization and depolymerization terms with rates k p and k d , respectively . D F is the diffusive parameter of the F - actin . We write the transport equations in the cell frame and , accordingly , we define the velocity of the F - actin network as w = v F − v . We impose zero fluxes on the cell boundaries to reflect that no F - actin can enter or leave the cell domain . Similarly , we model the myosin motors bound to the F - actin network [ 43 , 2 , 41 ] , ρ M , as ∂ t ρ M + ∂ x ( wρ M − D∂ x ρ M ) = 0 . ( 4 ) D is the effective diffusion parameter [ 2 , 41 ] . The bound myosin also obeys zero flux boundary con - ditions to describe that no bound myosin motors can enter or leave the cell . All model parameters are summarized in Table SII . 2 . 3 Coupling the clutch and the active gel model The friction between the actin network flow has two components , η = η 0 + ˆ η . η 0 = 0 . 05 kP a · s / µm 2 is a baseline friction of the retrograde flow with the surrounding cytoskeletal structures . ˆ η is an effective friction parameter ˆ η = P / ˆ v that arises from the friction created by the adhesion complexes . For cells expressing pure slip and catch bonds , there is a maximum traction force at a stiffness value , E ≈ 1kPa , called optimum stiffness ( Fig . 2a ) . Below and above the optimum stiffness , the traction forces increase and decrease with an increasing value of the substrate rigidity , respectively . However , reinforced bonds show that the traction forces increases as the stiffness of the ECM increases . For the slip case , the effective friction has also a maximum of ≈ 4 kP a · s / µm 2 at the optimum rigidity ( Fig . 2b ) . The friction is ≈ 2 kP a at 0 . 1 kPa and vanishes for substrate rigidities larger than 10 kPa . Friction increases monotically from zero to ≈ 4 . 5 kP a · s / µm 2 in the reinforced case . Because ACs only exert tractions where they form , we weight these friction values by an averaged ACs density of 0 . 1 , meaning that ACs occupies the 10 % of the contact area . These differences in the cell adhesion behavior could explain the opposite durotactic modes found across cell types . 2 . 4 Numerical solution of the system of equations and model parameters We solve computationally the system above ( Material and Methods 2 . 2 ) in a staggered approach . We use the finite element method to discretize the system in space , and an implicit second - order Crank - Nicholson method to discretize the parabolic equations in time [ 60 , ? ] . The numerical solution of the parabolic equations can present undesired oscillations if the problem becomes con - vective dominant , i . e . P e > 1 . The Peclet numbers for the actin and myosin transport problems are 4 P e F = hw / 2 D F and P e M = hw / 2 D respectively , where h is the size of the finite elements . As the convective velocity is the solution of the problem , we cannot guarantee a priori that the problem will remain in the limit case of P e < 1 . We use finite elements of constant size h = l f ( t ) / N , where N is the number of elements . Because we want to keep the number of elements of our domain constant , and avoid remeshing strategies in the case that the element size needs to be decreased to keep P e < 1 , we include the Stream - Upwind Pretrov Galerkin ( SUPG ) stabilization term to overcome possible numerical oscillations in our solution [ ? ] . The complete finite element and time discretization procedure is presented in Supplementary Material . The model parameters of the clutch and active gel model are summarized in Tables S1 - S3 . 3 Results 3 . 1 Cell adhesion explains positive and negative durotaxis To analyze the exposure of cells to exogenous stimuli in the form of a shallow or a highly localized stiffness gradients , we use samples of varying length ( 200 , 500 and 1000 µ m ) with stiffnesses between 0 . 1 and 100kPa [ 10 ] ( Fig . 2a ) . The clutch model predicts traction stresses and retrograde flow as a function of the ECM rigidity and bonds behaviour ( see Fig . 2a and Materials and Methods ) . Then , an effective friction ˆ η can be obtained to inform an active gel model for cell migration ( see Materials and Methods ) about the asymmetry that the stiffness gradient induce in the cell - ECM friction . We initially seed cells at three different locations of the sample to study how the absolute value of the substrate stiffness , and not only its gradient , may regulate the durotactic response . We consider that cells undergo durotaxis if the migration velocity is larger than v = 1 nm / s , otherwise we assume that they spread and remain stationary . We analyze the process during the first 20 minutes , when the durotactic response is already apparent . Cells seeded in the sample of 1000 µ m in length do not express durotaxis . However , there is a strong durotactic response in cells seeded on the 200 µ m - length sample . Cells seeded on the 500 µ m - length sample also sustain durotaxis but at a lower degree . In the three samples ( 200 , 500 and 1000 µ m ) , the strongest durotactic response is obtained for cells located at the center of the sample ( E ≈ 1 - 10 kPa ) . This is due to a large friction gradient ( Fig . 2b ) and an absolute friction that enable the intracellular polarization . In terms of migration direction ( Fig . 2c ) , all cells with reinforced adhesions moves toward the positive stiffness gradient of the ECM with similar migration velocities that peak for substrate rigidities between 0 . 1 - 1 kPa . However , without reinforcement , cells can migrate toward positive or negative stiffness gradients of the ECM . Cells located on the left of the optimal rigidity ( E = 0 . 1 - 1 kPa ) undergo positive durotaxis . Cells located at the stiffest region of the samples , above 10 kPa , and where no friction gradient exists , show a weak durotactic response and stay mostly stationary . However , cells located just on the right of the optimal rigidity , E ≈ 1 - 10 kPa , express negative durotaxis . This is because of a negative friction gradient . For the strongest durotactic expression , in the 200 µ m - length sample and for cells seeded on the right of the optimal rigidity , the maximum migration velocity is v ≈ 8 nm / s . Cells seeded on the left of the optimal rigidity migrate with v ≈ 4 . 5 nm / s . However , cells seeded on E ≈ 10 - 100 kPa show a weak durotactic response . To understand the physical mechanisms behind durotaxis , we further analyze the model results for the strongest durotactic response ( right of the optimal rigidity , 200 µ m sample ) of cells express - ing slip bonds ( Fig . 2a , c ) . We analyze the model during 20 min , when the migration velocity is maximum . The actomyosin network polarizes ( Fig . 2d ) because of an asymmetric retrograde flow ( Fig . 2e ) that results from asymmetric adhesion forces . The asymmetric retrograde flow and the constant polymerization velocity at both cell edges makes one side of the cell to protrude faster 5 Figure 2 : Results of computational clutch models for cells expressing slip ( slip case ) and reinforced catch bonds ( reinforced case ) for values of the substrate rigidity in 0 . 1 - 100 kPa .

In the sample of 500 µ m in length , i = 83 µ m , ii = 250 µ m , iii = 416 µ m . In the sample of 1000 µ m in length , i = 150 µ m , ii = 500 µ m , iii = 850 µ m .

Cells elongates 4 - fold from the initial length and the cell membrane reaches a tension of ≈ 60 pN / nm ( Fig . S1 ) , similar to previous ex - perimental data [ 46 ] . The stress of the actomyosin network is mostly symmetric with a maximum at the cell center of 50 P a ( Fig . S1 ) . This result indicates that the actomyosin network imposes a traction on the nuclear region of the cell , which is also in agreement with previous results on the mechanosensitivity of the cell nucleus [ 9 ] . All other cases of durotaxis shown in Fig . 2 exhibit similar results , with the model variables polarized towards the positive or negative direction , de - pending on the direction of the friction polarization , and a smaller or larger polarization depending on the strength of the durotaxis response ( Fig . S2 ) . All cases with spreading signatures ( see Fig . 2 ) show an almost symmetric distribution of all models variables ( Fig . S3 ) . At steady state ( Fig . 3 ) , the friction values are symmetric and large enough to significantly reduce the retrograde flow , which reduces the front - rear differences between the inward flow and the outward actin polymerization velocity and , consequently , cells get into an stationary spreading - like phase . To further analyse the durotaxis dynamics as cells travel along the sample until they reach a steady state ( reached when cells stop and no longer migrate ) , we focus on the three cases ( Fig . S3 ) : the two slip cases of cells initially seeded on the left and right of the optimum rigidity in the 200 µ m - length sample ( strong positive and negative durotaxis expression , respectively , Fig . 2c ) and the reinforced case with cells seeded on the stiff side , E ≈ 30 kPa , of the 200 µ m - length sample ( positive durotaxis expression , Fig . 2c ) . As cells migrate , they travel through regions of different stiffnesses ( Fig . S3b - d ) and , therefore , the friction computed through the clutch model also changes 6 Figure 3 : Analysis of duro - taxis until steady state . All cells are in a sample of 200 µ m in length . For the slip cases ( b - c ) , cells are located at soft ( a , point i ) and intermediate stiffness ( a , point ii ) locations . For the reinforced case , cells are seeded at stiff locations ( a , point iii ) . ( a ) Migration ve - locity of the cell . ( b - d ) Ky - mographs of the cell friction for the three durotactic cases analyzed . in space and time ( Fig . 3b - d ) . In the slip cases , cells migrate toward the optimal rigidity location and stop when they reach it ( Fig . 3b and Fig . 3a ) . Cells stall at the optimal rigidity because they reach a symmetric distribution of the adhesion forces , which reverses the durotactic mode into the symmetric spreading phase ( Fig . 3a - c ) . The non - motile steady state is reached at ≈ 1 and 4 hrs for cells expressing negative and positive durotaxis , respectively ( Fig . 3 ) . For the reinforced case , where no optimal rigidity exists , cells stall when they reach a friction of ≈ 4 . 5 kP a · s / µm 2 at a stiffness of ≈ 60 kPa . 3 . 2 Durotaxis response to talin plasmids : switching to negative durotaxis Then , we look into the effect of talin knockdown , because we know that it changes the cell adhesion behavior remarkably [ 10 ] and , ask ourselves if it could reverse positive durotaxis . By talin depletion , talin reinforcement is cancelled and , therefore , the adhesion behaves as a pure catch bond . This inhibition of the adhesion reinforcement induces a drastic reduction in cell trac - tion and , consequently , in cell friction above a new optimal rigidity that forms at E ≈ 7 kPa ( Fig . 4a ) . To analyze this idea , we use again a sample of 200 µ m in length and we seed cells at E ≈ 30 kPa . We choose this location to analyze substrate regions where the catch and the talin reinforced cases differ ( white region , Fig . 4a ) . Our results show that we are able to shift the direction of durotaxis by inhibiting adhesion reinforcement ( Fig . 4b ) . Furthermore , the motility of the cell is enhanced , and the maximum migration velocity doubles in the knockdown case to ≈ 8 nm / s . These cells reach the target optimal rigidity in ≈ 90 min ( Fig . 4b ) . At the optimal rigidity , the cell reaches a state of symmetric friction , which makes it to depolarize and stall . Therefore , the talin knockdown allows us to switch the directed durotaxis . Moreover , we could tune the location where the motility of the cell stalls and , therefore , we could design matrices to precisely control the target locations in cell migration . 3 . 3 Engineering durotaxis Finally , we further explore possibilities for engineering durotaxis other than the matrix features where cells are seeded . Specifically , we are interested in physical quantities that may enhance , arrest or shift durotaxis . Our results above indicate that cell adhesion , in particular the asymmetric distribution of the adhesion strength , controls durotaxis . Therefore , we should arrest durotaxis when the traction force vanishes , are too high or there is no friction gradients , enhance it when the friction gradient increases , in combination with placing cells in specific stiffnesses , and shift the durotactic direction if the friction gradient changes sign . We focus on adhesion parameters that 7 Figure 4 : ( a ) Results of computational clutch models for cells expressing catch ( catch case ) and reinforced catch bonds ( reinforced case ) for values of the substrate rigidity between 0 . 1 - 100 kPa . Effective friction for the catch case ( dash ) and reinforced case ( solid ) . Similarly to the traction forces , friction increases monotonically for increasing values of the substrate rigidity in the reinforced case , while in the catch case it presents a hill shape with a maximum at ≈ 1 kPa .

Figure 5 : Results of computational clutch models for the traction force of cells expressing ( a ) pure catch bonds ( catch case ) and ( b ) reinforced catch bonds ( reinforced case ) for values of the substrate rigidity in 0 . 1 - 100 kPa . All cells are in a sample of 200 µ m in length . The control cases are plotted in black . We show cases of arrested ( red , point ii ) and enhanced ( blue , point i ) migration , and shifted migration direction ( green , point iii ) . The the binding rate k ont and the slip part of the off - rate in all the unbinding models k off , slip , the catch part of the unbinding rate k off , catch , the number of integrins added to the system int add , and the rate of vinculin attachment k onv are analyzed . Migration velocity during durotaxis simulated until steady - state for catch ( c ) and reinforced cases of cell adhesion ( d ) . can clearly induce these changes in the adhesion behaviour and that are prone to be manipulated in - vitro and in - vivo . To do so , we performed a parametric analysis of different adhesion models parameters ( the binding rate k ont , the slip part of the off - rate in all the unbinding models k off , slip , the catch part of the unbinding rate , k off , catch , the number of integrins added to the system int add and the rate of vinculin attachment k onv ) . We show in Fig . 5 the specific values of the model parameters and the resulting traction . Among the different possibilities prone to change durotaxis , we present one case of enhancement , 8 arrest and direction shifting of durotaxis for each adhesion case . We show that in the pure catch case , where the maximum migration velocity in the control case is ≈ 5 nm / s , we can enhance durotaxis by decreasing the off - rate of the catch bond ( Fig . 5a , c ) . We show that the migration velocity increases to 12 nm / s ( Fig . 5c ) . We also demonstrate a shift in the migration direction when the off - rate the integrin increases . These two modification are enable by increasing and decreasing the rigidity gradient , respectively . To shift the direction of migration , i . e . to shift the gradient sign , we increase the on binding rate of the integrin . Similarly , for the reinforced case ( Fig . 5b ) , we can foster durotaxis by increasing the off - rate of the catch part of the bond . In this case , the migration velocity increases from ≈ 5 nm / s in the control case to ≈ 7 nm / s ( Fig . 5d ) . We can arrest durotaxis by increasing the recruitment of integrins to the AC , which creates friction large enough to significantly reduce the retrograde flow . Finally , we can also shift the durotaxis direction , with a remarkable enhancement in the migration velocity of ≈ 12 nm / s ( Fig . 5d ) , by reducing the on rate of vinculin to talin . This inhibition of vinculin binding cancels the adhesion reinforcement and , at the same time , increase the friction gradient ( see also Fig . 4 ) . 4 Discussion Durotaxis represents a universal mode of directed cell migration . Although it manifests across most cell types , fibroblasts [ 28 ] and smooth muscle cells [ 54 ] express positive durotaxis , while others , e . g . neurons [ 25 ] and human fibrosarcoma cells [ 47 ] , present negative durotaxis . How the physical mechanisms that enable cell motility cooperate to activate these remarkable and reversed modes of durotaxis were hindered behind complex in - vivo and in - vitro tests . Different theoretical and computational models have explained positive and negative durotaxis individually ( see , e . g , [ 33 , 24 , 34 ] ) . Recently , a clutch model in cooperation with experimental data showed the role of adhesion mechanics in dictating the durotactic direction . Here , we couple clutch models with classical active gel models for cell migration , from where we can recover actin flows and densities at a time and spatial scale . Our theory also explains positive and negative durotaxis by the mechanics of cell adhesion . Our results suggest that cells that express bonds with talin reinforcement follow positive durotaxis while those that express negative durotaxis are crowded by either pure slip or catch bonds . This is the case , e . g . , of fibroblasts [ 10 , 28 ] and neurons [ 5 ] , respectively . In other words , reinforcement seems to control the durotactic response . Our results also support and validate previous experimental data . We show that cells need a strong stiffness gradient in order to express durotaxis and that they prefer intermediate stiffnesses rather than soft or stiff substrates [ 18 , 25 , 48 , 20 , 16 , 18 ] . Indeed , there is a sweet spot at 1 - 5 kPa that favors durotaxis . Conversely , lower and higher stiffnesses reduce cell motility , which are aligned with low and high friction forces , respectively , which can even arrest durotaxis . These results may also explain differences between weakly and strongly adherent cancer cells [ 58 ] . Interestingly , our results also show that cells migrate through the extracellular space guided by the stiffness gradient up to regions of large and symmetric adhesion forces , where the asymmetry of the motile forces stall and cells stop . These results indicate that cells migrate towards the optimal rigidity location , when it exists , or up to a location of a friction large enough to stall the polarization of the cell . We also show specific aspects of the adhesion complex that can be pinpointed to control the strength and the direction of durotaxis . Future experimental work should confirm these predictions and further interact with computational models to exploit the control of cell migration . Because mechanical cues usually coexist with other exogenous signals , our theory can be extended to in - corporate , e . g . , chemotaxis and investigate the competition between these two prevalent migrating cues . Our theory explains durotaxis based on the polarized mechanical feedback from the ACs to the retrograde flow . However , a differential membrane tension could also induce indirect down - stream signals to enhance actin and myosin activity and aid in the formation of a clear cell front 9 and rear . A deep understanding and precise control of the mechanisms in cell motility may allows us to not only understand how tumor cells invade healthy tissues and metastasize [ 14 , 57 ] or how cells orchestrate the tissues regeneration [ 13 , 42 ] but also provide tools to arrest tumor progression [ 4 ] and to engineer cell migration for better biomimetic tissue designs [ 17 , 59 ] . 5 Author Contributions P .
