By linking performance feedback theory with theories of attention and M - form organizations , we show that corporate structure inﬂuences the relationship between performance below aspira - tions and business unit adaptation . Because corporate structure vertically differentiates performance goals and problemistic search , solutions to performance problems vary across corporate and business unit levels , with divergent implications for business unit adaptation . We examine business unit adaptation empirically through new product introductions in the global mobile device industry , ﬁnding that poor performance at the business unit level leads to greater new product introduc - tions . In contrast , corporate - level responses to performance problems have a negative cross - level effect on new product introductions . We also ﬁnd that these negative effects are attenuated for strategically signiﬁcant business units , which have more input into corporate responses . By linking structural and behavioral drivers of action , this paper contributes to the knowledge and understanding of adaptive behavior in multidivisional ﬁrms . Key words : adaptation ; performance feedback ; multiple goals ; M - form organization History : Published online in Articles in Advance November 5 , 2012 . Introduction A large body of research suggests that low performance motivates ﬁrms to alter their internal activities and to seek new products , markets , and strategies ( Audia and Brion 2007 , Greve 2007 , Park 2007 , Iyer and Miller 2008 , Vissa et al . 2010 , Gaba and Bhattacharya 2012 ) . Yet in the multidivisional ( M - form ) ﬁrm , which features corporate allocation of resources and business units that focus on implementation and operations ( Chandler 1962 , Williamson 1975 ) , adaptive behavior depends on corpo - rate and business unit responsibilities , goals , and perfor - mance ( Galunic and Eisenhardt 2001 ) . In particular , poor performance at different levels of the ﬁrm may not have uniform consequences for the behavior of business unit managers , a central driver of adaptive change ( Bower 1970 , Burgelman 1991 ) . Our goal in this paper is to understand these differences and to examine the effects of corporate and business unit performance below aspi - rations on business unit adaptation—speciﬁcally , on unit efforts to launch new products . Performance feedback has long been recognized as an important mechanism for adaptive behavior ( Cyert and March 1963 ) , and it is based on the premise that ﬁrms learn from experience and alter activities condi - tional on their performance below an aspiration level or reference point ( Greve 2003b ) . Performance feedback models are fairly robust , but most assume that all orga - nizational units either share the same aspiration level ( e . g . , Bromily 1991 , Greve 1998 ) or adopt the aspira - tion level of top management ( e . g . , Lant et al . 1992 , Miller and Chen 1994 , Audia et al . 2000 ) . The empirical research’s focus on singular aspiration levels has sup - planted the Carnegie School’s original notion of multiple goals ( Simon 1947 , March and Simon 1958 , Cyert and March 1963 ) and has hindered theoretical treatment of adaptive behavior amidst multiple performance goals . Studies have recently begun to examine the adap - tive implications of different functional goals . The sep - aration of functional activities allows functional areas to operate semiautonomously—allowing , for example , marketing to deal with product sales and operations to deal with supply chain management . As a result , efforts to correct unsatisfactory performance reﬂect the interests and aspiration levels of the focal subunit . For example , Baum et al . ( 2005 ) ﬁnd that marketing - and investment - related aspirations have independent effects on a bank’s selection of investment partners . Similarly , Audia and Sorenson ( 2001 ) argue that the division of labor between business and technology managers in computer manufacturing ﬁrms leads to differences in their aspirations . Functional subunits create and monitor their own unique performance metrics and react differ - ently to environmental feedback . 1102 D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 152 . 3 . 102 . 242 ] on 03 J a nu a r y 2014 , a t 10 : 37 .

Gaba and Joseph : Corporate Structure and Performance Feedback : Aspirations and Adaptation in M - Form Firms Organization Science 24 ( 4 ) , pp . 1102 – 1119 , ©2013 INFORMS 1103 Although these studies provide useful insights into the behavioral outcomes that follow from horizontally dif - ferentiated goals , researchers have yet to consider the role that corporate goals and hierarchy play in business unit adaptation through performance feedback . This is a crucial oversight because corporate - level responses to poor performance may have different adaptive impli - cations for business units than do those units’ own responses . A business unit’s response to poor perfor - mance will likely target its own operations and product market activities with limited impact on other parts of the organization ( Simon 1962 ) . However , the corporate ofﬁce is concerned about the overall enterprise , so its responses to unsatisfactory performance may have cross - level effects on adaptive behavior of constituent business units . In particular , we ask the following two questions : How does corporate structure affect a ﬁrm’s responses to poor performance ? What are the effects of corporate and business unit performance below aspirations on business unit behavior ? We empirically examine the effects of performance below aspirations , at both corporate and business unit levels , on business unit adaptation using quar - terly data on mobile device manufacturers for the period 2002 – 2008 . This single - industry setting , which is dominated by global multibusiness ﬁrms , provides an opportunity to examine the effects of performance feedback across multiple levels of organizational hierar - chy . We focus on performance below aspirations because it activates problem - driven search rather than planned or institutional search , for which behavioral interpreta - tions of adaptation may be less central ( Greve 2003b ) . For our dependent variable—adaptive behavior of the business unit—we measure the rate of product introduc - tions . New product introductions are a critical activity for unit adaptation and survival ( Dougherty 1992 , Brown and Eisenhardt 1995 ) . This is especially true in high - tech industries , where new products facilitate the trans - formation of ﬁrms and the industries in which they are embedded ( Burgelman 1991 ) . Our primary thesis is that problemistic search differs as a function not only of corporate versus business unit performance problems but also of the respective level’s responses . We argue that , because performance shortfalls at the business unit level activate responses that focus on revenue enhancements and efﬁciency improvements , the rate of new product introductions increases . In con - trast , poor performance at the corporate level may lead to reductions in discretionary spending and to disruptive reorganizations at the ﬁrm level , which constrain busi - ness unit managers and reduce the rate of new product introductions . In addition , when corporate performance declines , the business units may become more cautious and limit changes because they anticipate a tightening of resources and control . We posit that the corporate - level effects are attenuated for strategically signiﬁcant business units , which have disproportionate weight in decision making and are less concerned about declines in corporate performance . Such business units may be granted more discretion by the corporate ofﬁce and so may be able to limit corporate actions that would other - wise hinder new product introductions . This paper makes two main contributions . First , we show the behavioral outcomes of attention to mul - tiple goals within a vertical hierarchy . We link perfor - mance feedback theory ( Greve 2003b ) to theories of attention ( Ocasio 1997 , Bouquet and Birkinshaw 2008 , Joseph and Ocasio 2012 ) and M - form organizations ( Chandler 1962 , Williamson 1975 ) in order to explain how adaptive behavior through performance feedback is realized in the multidivisional ﬁrm . This consideration of the corporate structure and multiple goals addresses a limitation of existing research on performance feed - back , which relies heavily on the assumption that aspi - rations and reactions to poor performance are uniform throughout the ﬁrm . Second , by linking structural and behavioral mechanisms in a decision - making model of adaptive change , our study provides a better understand - ing of cross - level effects—in particular , of the corporate level on business unit responses to poor performance . Our work extends foundational M - form studies as well as more recent work on adaptation in multibusiness ﬁrms , which typically do not integrate behavioral mech - anisms . We also extend the behavioral theory of the ﬁrm , which ignores the implications of corporate structure for problemistic search in complex organizations . Problemistic Search in the Multidivisional Firm A core idea in the behavioral theory of the ﬁrm is that decision makers refer to an aspiration level , which is “the smallest outcome that would be deemed satisfactory by the decision maker” ( Schneider 1992 , p . 1053 ) , when evaluating performance . Decision making with reference to aspiration levels is the result of boundedly rational decision makers attempting to simplify evaluation by transforming a continuous measure of performance into a discrete measure of success or failure ( Greve 2003b ) . Failure to achieve aspirations is said to trigger prob - lemistic search —in other words , “search that is stim - ulated by a problem 000 and is directed toward ﬁnding a solution to that problem” ( Cyert and March 1963 , p . 121 ) . In practical terms , the solutions sought by man - agers are drawn from response repertoires designed to close the performance – aspiration gap . Response reper - toires are similar to what Miller and Chen ( 1994 , 1996 ) call “competitive” repertoires and are the strategic and tactical levers available to managers for dealing with performance problems . These repertoires of actions will vary in their comprehensiveness and intensity depend - ing on the cause and extent of the performance shortfall ( Hambrick and D’Aveni 1988 ) .

Gaba and Joseph : Corporate Structure and Performance Feedback : Aspirations and Adaptation in M - Form Firms 1104 Organization Science 24 ( 4 ) , pp . 1102 – 1119 , ©2013 INFORMS An overlooked consideration in the literature is that problemistic search following poor performance ( and the solutions found ) are likely to differ across levels in a multidivisional ﬁrm . The multidivisional ﬁrm was designed , in part , to deal with bounded rationality and by limits on the amount of information that decision makers can process ( Simon 1957 , Chandler 1962 , Williamson 1985 ) . Multibusiness ﬁrms are characterized by a decen - tralized system of semiautonomous operating units and a corporate ofﬁce with responsibility for overall ﬁrm performance , strategy , and the allocation of resources among divisions . The corporate structure allocates the attention of corporate executives and business unit man - agers to ﬁrmwide and business unit performance goals , respectively ( Ocasio 1995 ) . As a result , the relevance of discrepancies between aspirations and current perfor - mance will vary with the structural position of decision makers within the corporate hierarchy . Also differing will be the respective responses to poor performance , given that the underlying assumptions of problemistic search have different implications at the corporate versus business unit level of decision making . According to the behavioral theory of the ﬁrm , there are three underlying assumptions of problemistic search : ( 1 ) problem solving is motivated in areas consid - ered important by managers and their key constituents , ( 2 ) problem solving is shaped by managers’ experiences and by the information available to them for decision making , and ( 3 ) problem solutions are sought “near” the symptoms . These basic assumptions do not exhaust the possibilities for contextual elements activating distinct corporate and business unit responses to performance problems . However , they do cover the key theoretical considerations highlighted in the foundational theory ( Cyert and March 1963 ) and are also critical to the problem - solving activities of organizations . First , corporate and business unit managers have different motivations because of their different goals and corresponding pressures from their respective con - stituents . Business units are under pressure from the corporate ofﬁce to achieve unit - speciﬁc performance targets . At the business unit level , these parochial aspira - tions ( e . g . , unit proﬁtability ) set the evaluative standard that activates problemistic search when performance is unsatisfactory ( Audia and Sorenson 2001 ) . At the corpo - rate level , however , attention to ﬁrm - level performance reﬂects external pressures to achieve quarterly earnings ( proﬁt ) goals . Corporate executives , including the chief executive ofﬁcer ( CEO ) , are subject to pressure from such ﬁrm constituents as ﬁnancial analysts and investors ( Kaplan and Minton 2006 , Wiersema and Zhang 2011 ) . Proﬁt goals are reinforced by social , cultural , and eco - nomic incentives that , in turn , drive short - term behavior . Second , corporate and business unit managers bring different biases to problem - solving efforts , biases that are shaped by each manager’s background and expe - rience . Whereas business unit managers are anchored by their experiences in the industry and the local prod - uct market in which they operate , corporate executives are relatively distant from the routine operation of busi - ness units and are more concerned about the overall enterprise’s strategy and performance ( Chandler 1962 , p . 309 ) . Hence the corporate ofﬁce’s problem - solving activities derive from portfolio management experience , not from the product market experience of their busi - ness unit counterparts . Moreover , these biases shape the nature of information sought to ground decisions , which in turn reinforces the distinct responses of corporate and business unit managers . Third , causal models of decision making differ across levels . At the business unit level , parochial goals and divisional autonomy make for relatively close links among problem symptoms , causes , and solutions . That focus helps business unit managers more accurately diagnose problems and converge on appropriate solu - tions to those problems ( Ethiraj and Levinthal 2004 ) . However , causal models at the corporate level are more complex . This is because corporate decision makers typ - ically face many interdependent problems that must be managed simultaneously . As a result , these managers seek broad solutions that cover a range of different problems across the corporation’s entire portfolio of businesses . In short , responses of the corporate ofﬁce and business units to performance problems differ signiﬁcantly , which suggests that these responses have distinctive implica - tions for business unit behavior . In the next section we develop hypotheses regarding how the different response repertoires available to the corporate versus the business unit level affect the latter’s adaptive behavior in the form of new product introductions . Effects of Corporate and Business Unit Performance Feedback Business Unit Response Repertoires and New Product Introductions The assumptions underlying problemistic search at the business unit level suggest that business unit managers react to poor performance of their unit with initia - tives that target internal operations and core products . These responses are driven by corporate pressures on the business unit to achieve satisfactory levels of per - formance . In multidivisional ﬁrms , corporate executives allocate cash ﬂow to promising business units and estab - lish internal incentives and controls to monitor resources ( Williamson 1985 ) . Unit managers must demonstrate satisfactory performance so that the corporate ofﬁce will continue to provide the funds necessary to ﬁnance growth and pursue opportunities . For this reason , busi - ness unit responses designed to address unsatisfactory D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 152 . 3 . 102 . 242 ] on 03 J a nu a r y 2014 , a t 10 : 37 .

Gaba and Joseph : Corporate Structure and Performance Feedback : Aspirations and Adaptation in M - Form Firms Organization Science 24 ( 4 ) , pp . 1102 – 1119 , ©2013 INFORMS 1105 performance reﬂect managerial attempts to increase the size and prominence of their respective operating divi - sions and to compete with other units for resources on the basis of differential proﬁt performance ( Williamson 1970 ) . When performance is poor , solutions that would affect other business units are less favored than solu - tions that target the focal unit’s product market . Facing poor performance , business unit managers are also likely to eschew investing in products with long development cycles in favor of a focus on solutions that accelerate new product introductions . This parochial focus is reinforced by the experi - ence and knowledge of business unit decision mak - ers . Because the responsibility for operating decisions is assigned to subunits ( Williamson 1970 , 1975 ) , the exper - tise of their managers is grounded in the unit’s industry and product markets . Industry experience reinforces pre - vailing models of how the industry operates , and it also aids managers in identifying a set of rivals ( Porac and Thomas 1990 ) and directing new product commercial - ization ( Tripsas and Gavetti 2000 ) . A parochial focus affects what information is sought and how it is inter - preted ( Daft and Weick 1984 ) —in particular , the infor - mation on products , technologies , and markets that are relevant to the focal business unit . As a result , the expe - rience of business unit managers is likely to restrict the search for solutions to internal operations and focal product markets . Operational solutions include improving efﬁciency , reducing costs , and increasing output ( Hambrick and Schecter 1983 ) . Business unit managers may attempt to rationalize manufacturing , improve support systems , and limit the number of approvals required in the develop - ment process ( Krubasik 1988 ) . Product market solutions will likely target core products . To increase revenue , the business unit may shift human capital from exploratory or long - term projects to more current projects that are closer to shipping . Hence less attention is given to uncer - tain technologies , markets , or products for which the unit has limited capabilities ( Hambrick and Schecter 1983 ) . For example , when a performance downturn hit Motorola in 2006 , managers were pulled off internal ventures targeted for commercialization in 3 – 5 years and reassigned to teams whose products were targeted to launch within the next quarter . As one vice president at Motorola noted in a phone interview following the downturn , “Motorola has to do what it has to do to be proﬁtable . If you are not building a device , you are just doing something that helps a device get shipped . ” There - fore our ﬁrst hypothesis is as follows . Hypothesis 1 ( H1 ) . As the business unit performance – aspiration gap 4 below aspirations 5 increases , the rate of new product introductions increases . Corporate Response Repertoires and New Product Introductions Poor performance at the corporate level also shapes new product introductions , the consequence of corporate response repertoires . Corporate response repertoires are , in part , affected by the pressures of external constituents , such as the investment community . Research has demon - strated that analyst and investor concerns about a ﬁrm’s earnings and stock price induce corporate managers to behave myopically ( Stein 1989 ) . Myopic investment behavior refers to the deliberate underinvestment in long - term products in order to meet short - term goals ( Porter 1992 ) . Thus executives seek to pump up earnings and thereby raise forecasted value , because higher short - term earnings will be viewed as an indicator of higher future earnings ( Stein 1989 ) . The investment commu - nity rewards ﬁrms that exhibit such myopic behavior . Research has shown , for example , that analysts are more attentive and positive toward incumbent strategies that extend and preserve an existing technology than toward strategies that incorporate products with new technolo - gies ( Benner 2010 ) . Myopic investment may be manifest in a corporate emphasis on short - term performance and the elimina - tion of spending that lacks a clear relationship with short - term proﬁtability ( Cyert and March 1963 , p . 171 ) . When performance problems arise , corporate managers may cut discretionary spending ( e . g . , advertising , travel , training ) and human resources ( e . g . , by laying off con - sultants or even employees ) in an attempt to increase current earnings and focus the business units on core activities ( Bushee 1998 ) . The downside to such resource tightening is its negative effect on the ﬁrm’s front line , where such spending can help with the development and launching of new products . Business unit managers are left with fewer resources to distribute and are forced to reduce investments in new programs . Even if resource tightening does not occur immediately , a downturn in corporate performance may signal impending reductions and thus impel business unit managers to cut back on a variety of activities . Corporate managers also come to rely on broad cost - cutting measures because tactical solutions are more difﬁcult to devise . The M - form organization is a mul - tilevel decision - making environment ( Bower 1970 ) that creates complexity in the assessment of performance solutions . Although corporate managers can recognize declines in proﬁtability , they know less than front - line managers about optimal solutions . Rather , corporate managers , who typically lack ﬁrsthand knowledge about the speciﬁcs of the industry , technological area , or geo - graphic region in which they operate ( Hill and Hoskisson 1987 ) , are more well versed in portfolio management . Absent a detailed operational understanding of speciﬁc businesses , corporate managers may prefer to mandate a D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 152 . 3 . 102 . 242 ] on 03 J a nu a r y 2014 , a t 10 : 37 .

Corporate managers also rely more heavily than do unit managers on such objective evaluation criteria as ﬁnancial information , which by its nature is removed from operational activities ( Hoskisson et al . 1993 ) and reﬂects more generic performance indicators that can nonetheless activate perceptions of success and fail - ure . A related aspect of ﬁrm - level feedback is that it may uncover a host of problems that should all be addressed . Thus , a corporate - level problemistic search process may involve more organizational resources and lead to responses that could solve multiple problems . For example , another mechanism relied on by cor - porate managers to improve performance is changing the organizational structure ( Haveman 1992 ) . Reorga - nizations , consolidations , and divestitures are all com - mon responses to a performance downturn , especially because such reorganization is often designed to solve multiple problems . However , the resulting changes are extremely disruptive to business unit activities ( Miller and Friesen 1984 ) and may therefore impede the units’ efforts to improve performance—speciﬁcally , by affect - ing new product introductions . In summary , the effects of cross - level responses on business unit behavior may discourage adaptive change through new products . This is because corporate man - agers , in responding to corporate performance declines , may take actions that constrain business unit managers ( e . g . , by cutting costs in ways that curtail unit - level actions or issuing directives that limit new initiatives ) . At the same time , corporate performance declines may lead business unit managers to be more cautious because they anticipate a tightening of resources and con - trol ; whether or not they materialize , the expectations themselves discourage managers from making changes . So rather than an increase in new product introductions , as suggested in the literature ( e . g . , Greve 2003b ) , cor - porate performance declines may actually result in a decrease . As one manager in the mobile devices business unit at Motorola noted , in his response to corporate cuts : “If we jump forward to the hemorrhaging that is going on right now 000 I had to lay off a huge part of my team here . But I think we are making short - term decisions at the expense of the long - term . I think we are throwing the baby out with the bathwater . I know why they are mak - ing [ those decisions ] . Motorola has to do what they have to do to be proﬁtable . ” We are thus led to suggest our next hypothesis . Hypothesis 2 ( H2 ) . As the corporate performance – aspiration gap ( below aspirations ) increases , the rate of new product introductions decreases . Variation in Corporate Attention to Business Units Our arguments so far have isolated the effects of corpo - rate and business unit performance feedback . We have argued that performance declines at the business unit level activate response repertoires that lead to more new product introductions , whereas corporate responses to poor performance have the opposite effect . Now we consider conditions under which business unit behavior is less affected by corporate responses to poor perfor - mance . We posit that greater corporate attention to a par - ticular business unit may inﬂuence corporate priorities and investments in favor of that unit and thus improve its capacity to adapt . Business units capable of garner - ing greater corporate attention are those that are strate - gically signiﬁcant , which lends them a greater voice and weight in corporate decision making and problem solv - ing ( Bouquet and Birkinshaw 2008 ) . Strategically sig - niﬁcant business units include those that account for a large share of the ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial performance and those with experience in providing solutions to the ﬁrm . These are important contingencies because strategically signif - icant business units affect the corporate agenda ( Joseph and Ocasio 2012 ) . The greater the business unit’s contribution to corpo - rate income , the greater the scrutiny that unit will likely receive from such key external constituents as ﬁnan - cial analysts and investors . Under these conditions , the corporate ofﬁce may be more sensitive to the potential negative effects stemming from its responses to poor performance on the business unit’s ability to adapt . The corporate ofﬁce may accordingly be less inclined to cut resources , so business unit managers of strategically sig - niﬁcant units may be less concerned about the threat of loss . Greater contribution to overall ﬁrm performance is also likely to provide these business unit managers with access to key positions within the ﬁrm . One pos - sible consequence is reduced information asymmetry between the corporate ofﬁce and business units regard - ing product market information and performance feed - back . Unit managers will interact more frequently with corporate executives and exert more inﬂuence in upper - echelon decision making ( Pfeffer 1992 ) , which would make unilateral corporate - level actions less probable or altogether unnecessary . Instead , corporate managers may come to accept product market – related solutions more readily than broader ﬁnancial or structural solutions . When many of the ﬁrm’s key positions are held by unit managers , corporate responses are less likely to impede business unit activities , or alternatively , busi - ness unit solutions will substitute for corporate solu - tions . In either case , the result is a reduction in the adverse effects of corporate performance feedback on business unit behavior . Formally , we propose the follow - ing hypothesis . D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 152 . 3 . 102 . 242 ] on 03 J a nu a r y 2014 , a t 10 : 37 . F o r p e r s on a l u s e on l y , a ll r i gh t s r e s e r v e d . Gaba and Joseph : Corporate Structure and Performance Feedback : Aspirations and Adaptation in M - Form Firms Organization Science 24 ( 4 ) , pp . 1102 – 1119 , ©2013 INFORMS 1107 Hypothesis 3 ( H3 ) . Corporate - level performance feedback effects on new product introductions are atten - uated for business units that generate a signiﬁcant share of corporate income . Business units with a great deal of experience may also be considered strategically signiﬁcant and so have greater inﬂuence on corporate decision making ( Bouquet and Birkinshaw 2008 ) . Extensive experience in the prod - uct market increases a business unit’s problem - solving capacity and its ability to manage environmental con - tingencies effectively ( Hickson et al . 1971 ) . Research suggests that subsidiary initiatives ( e . g . , new products or services ) that could increase overall ﬁrm value are the most likely to draw favorable attention from corporate headquarters . Hence a unit that has already produced many successful products may be given an increased contributory role ( Birkinshaw et al . 1998 ) and thus greater involvement in corporate learning and responses to feedback . In other words , business units with more experience have more inﬂuence at the corporate level— and this includes “selling” corporate managers on their solutions . With respect to new proposals , organizations tend to favor those developed in high - inﬂuence parts of the organization ( Burgelman and Grove 1996 ) ; this in turn should reduce the adverse effects on new product introductions that typically follow corporate responses to poor performance . With experience , business units gain the conﬁdence of corporate managers , have more free - dom to enact change , and can guard against resource decrements . Thus we have our ﬁnal hypothesis , as follows . Hypothesis 4 ( H4 ) . Corporate - level performance feedback effects on new product introductions are atten - uated for business units that have more extensive experience . Methods Sample Our sample consists of six ﬁrms in the global mobile device industry : Nokia , Motorola , Samsung , Sony Ericsson , Siemens , and LG . These ﬁrms are the largest cellular phone manufacturers in the world and accounted for 70 % – 85 % of total unit sales during the period of our study . The global mobile device industry is an ideal setting in which to examine the effects of corporate and business unit performance feedback on new prod - uct introductions . First , the major players in the industry are all multidivisional ﬁrms , which allows us to oper - ationalize variables at both the corporate and business unit levels and then to examine differential responses to performance feedback at each level . Second , this indus - try features a high rate of new product introductions . That allows us to use quarterly data , in which there is sufﬁcient variation over time—in both our dependent and independent variables—to enable identiﬁcation of our hypothesized effects . That the data are quarterly also allows us to analyze relatively shorter performance feed - back loops of business units and longer feedback loops of the corporate ofﬁce . Third , product strategies for the ﬁrms in our sample are roughly similar and focus on a wide variety of mobile phones . We collected quar - terly data from the ﬁrst quarter of 2002 through the last quarter in 2008 . In compiling these data , we relied on Internet searches as well as the World Cellular Infor - mation Service , the Informa World Cellular Handset Tracker , and the Strategy Analytics SpecTRAX database of mobile phones . Measures Dependent Variable . Our dependent variable is new product introductions as measured by the number of new phones introduced during each quarter in a year . Firms in the mobile phone industry operate in a dynamic competitive environment characterized by short product life cycles ; thus handset manufacturers are required to deliver a continuous stream of new products . In such an environment , continuous adaptation through high rates of new product introductions is crucial . We follow Martin and Mitchell ( 1998 ) and Katila and Ahuja ( 2002 ) in deﬁning a new product as a change in design charac - teristics . A mobile phone qualiﬁes as “new” if at least one of its design characteristics differs from those of the ﬁrm’s previous products . Independent Variables . Because we aim to examine the differences in corporate and business unit responses to performance shortfalls , our performance variables must be comparable across these levels of organizational hierarchy . Prior literature on performance feedback ( e . g . , Greve 2003b , Miller and Chen 2004 , Audia and Greve 2006 ) commonly uses return on assets ( ROA ) to measure corporate performance . These studies do not focus on the M - form structure and seldom make distinctions between corporate and business unit performance , so ROA suf - ﬁces to capture performance at the corporate level . Yet there is no business unit – level analogue to ROA because few ﬁrms provide accounting data on assets at the sub - unit level . However , our interviews and examination of analyst reports on Motorola and its internal company memos all suggest that operating proﬁt margins are care - fully monitored by managers at both the corporate and business unit levels . For example , a 2007 internal memo from the CEO to the ﬁrm following its performance downturn read as follows : “The shortfall in both sales and earnings occurred in our Mobile Devices business . 000 What are we doing about it ? Puting together a com - prehensive plan to improve our operating proﬁtability . ” In another internal memo , the CEO emphasized that Motorola “won’t chase market share for the sake of mar - ket share at the expense of margins and proﬁts . ” Given D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 152 . 3 . 102 . 242 ] on 03 J a nu a r y 2014 , a t 10 : 37 .

For the corporate unit , this means cor - porate operating income as a fraction of corporate sales ; for the business unit , it means business unit operating income as a fraction of business unit sales . Aspiration Levels . Following previous studies ( Greve 2003a , Audia and Greve 2006 ) , we calculate the histor - ical aspirations of ﬁrm i as an exponentially weighted moving average of its past performance . Let HA uit denote the historical aspirations of ﬁrm i at time t , where u indexes corporate versus business unit performance . Then HA uit = Å P uit É 1 + 4 1 É Å5 HA uit É 1 , where P uit is the performance in terms of operating proﬁt margin of the i th ﬁrm at level u and Å is an adjustment parameter . The weight Å was chosen by searching over all possi - ble values in increments of 0 . 1 and then using the value that yielded the maximum log - likelihood . This proce - dure resulted in Å = 0 0 1 ( respectively , Å = 0 0 3 ) for the corporate ( respectively , business unit ) measure . Following Cyert and March ( 1963 ) and Greve ( 2003a ) , we also computed aspiration levels as a weighted average of social and historical aspirations : A uit = Ç SA uit É 1 + 4 1 É Ç5 HA uit É 1 . Here , SA uit , ﬁrm i ’s social aspiration at the u th level ( u = corporate or business unit ) at time t , is the simple average of the appropri - ate performance variable over every other ﬁrm . That is , SA uit = P j 6 = i 4 P ujt / N 5 , where P ujt is the j th’s ﬁrm perfor - mance and N = 5 is the total number of other ﬁrms in ﬁrm i ’s industry sector . We use Clarke’s ( 2003 ) distribution - free test to pick the weights of social and historical aspirations . The test is based on the ratio of individual log - likelihoods from a pair of nonnested models and provides a hypothe - sis test for selecting one of those two models . At the corporate level , the Clarke test selects the model that puts all the weight on historical aspirations ; at the busi - ness unit level , it also selects a model that puts all the weight on historical aspiration—but only at the 10 % level of signiﬁcance . At the 5 % level , the test is unable to select between a model that puts 100 % weight on historical aspirations and the best - ﬁtting model that puts 60 % weight on historical aspirations and 40 % weight on social aspirations . At the same time , chi - square tests fail to reject that the hypothesis that coefﬁcients in the two models are signiﬁcantly different . So as to better align comparisons across levels of corporate hierarchy , we therefore use only historical aspirations in all our models . Finally , in a post hoc analysis , we show that the Bayesian information criterion selects the model with only historical aspirations over the model that uses both social and historical aspirations . Performance – Aspiration Gap . This gap is deﬁned as the difference between the performance and aspiration levels for each of the corporate and business units . We implemented a spline function to compare the effects of the performance – aspiration gap above and below the aspiration level ( Greve 2003a ) by splitting each perfor - mance variable into two variables . Performance below aspirations equals 0 for all observations in which the performance ( at the corporate or business unit level ) of the focal ﬁrm is greater than its aspirations ; for all other observations , it equals the difference between the perfor - mance and aspirations . Performance above aspirations is deﬁned symmetrically : it is 0 when the performance is below the aspirations and equals the performance – aspiration gap when performance falls above the aspi - rations . The gap variables in the empirical speciﬁcation are lagged by one quarter for the business unit and by four quarters for the corporate unit ; these lags were cho - sen on the basis of model maximum likelihood and the distribution - free test of Clarke ( 2003 ) . Our qualitative observations of new product introductions in the mobile device industry also support this choice of lags . 1 To examine the role of business unit strategic sig - niﬁcance , we use variables that capture two character - istics of the unit . First , BU importance is measured as the ratio of business unit operating income to the ﬁrm’s overall operating income of the ﬁrm , and it cap - tures the relative importance of the business unit in corporate performance . Second , BU experience is mea - sured as the cumulative number of prior mobile phones introduced by the business unit ; this variable reﬂects the relative experience of the business unit . To test H3 and H4 , we interact each of these variables with the performance – aspiration gap of the corporation unit . 2 Control Variables . To isolate the impact of theorized variables on new product introductions , we control for several other factors when estimating the model . First , we control for a variety of ﬁrm - level characteristics . As ﬁrms age , they acquire both experience in intro - ducing new products ( Sorenson and Stuart 2000 ) and inertia that may impede quick response ( Abernathy and Utterback 1978 ) . To control for age , we count the years since a ﬁrm’s founding . Because ﬁrms with a large stock of resources have the ﬁnancial and human resources to overcome performance problems ( Mitchell 1994 ) , we also control for ﬁrm size . For this , we use two vari - ables : the number of employees and the value of corpo - rate sales , both of which are logged . We include ﬁrm diversiﬁcation as a control because greater diversiﬁca - tion is reﬂected in corporate structure and may affect responsiveness to performance feedback at both the cor - porate and business unit level . Firm diversiﬁcation is calculated using the entropy measure ( Palepu 1985 ) , which is the weighted average of the log of inverse sales for each unit of the ﬁrm . We also include a control D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 152 . 3 . 102 . 242 ] on 03 J a nu a r y 2014 , a t 10 : 37 .

Patent data were drawn from Thompson Innovation and include worldwide patents for mobile device technology . Excess organizational resources ( slack ) enable ﬁrms to experiment and change ( Cyert and March 1963 , Greve 2003b ) . We use two mea - sures of slack : available slack as measured by the ﬁrm’s current ratio ( the ratio of current assets to liabilities ) and absorbed slack as measured by the ratio of sales , gen - eral , and administrative expenses to sales . The former variable captures the liquid resources that are uncommit - ted to liabilities ( Bromily 1991 ) , and the latter represents resources already absorbed by certain operational activ - ities yet still recoverable if necessary . 3 All our speciﬁcations are demanding in that they include both ﬁrm - speciﬁc and quarter - year dummies . Thus we rely on within - ﬁrm variations over time to iden - tify the hypothesized effects . The ﬁrm dummies account for all time - invariant , ﬁrm - speciﬁc unobserved hetero - geneity ; the time dummies account for common global and industry time effects ( e . g . , density of ﬁrms and mobile products , global growth in demand ) . In addition , if new product introductions are subject to seasonal fac - tors , then the quarter - year dummies should also account for these effects . 4 Table 1 provides summary statistics as well as corre - lations between the predictor variables . 5 Model Speciﬁcation New product introductions is a count variable that takes integer values from 0 onward with the data censored at zero .

The mean value for new prod - uct introductions is 20 . 26 and the variance is 239 . 3 . A variance that is , as here , nearly 12 times the mean indicates overdispersion , so a negative binomial model that explicitly estimates an overdispersion parameter may seem more appropriate than a Poisson model , which assumes equality of mean and variance . However , it is important to distinguish between true overdisper - sion and merely apparent overdispersion ( Cameron and Trivedi 2005 ) . Apparent overdispersion may arise when relevant variables are omitted . After incorporating ﬁrm and time ﬁxed effects into the Poisson model , we ﬁnd that standard tests for overdispersion ( Hardin and Hilbe 2007 , Cameron and Trivedi 2005 ) fail to reject the null of overdispersion . Hence the data are only apparently overdispersed , as there is no evidence for overdispersion once we incorporate a comprehensive set of ﬁrm and time ﬁxed effects . Incorporating multiple ﬁxed - effect vectors into an unconditional negative binomial speciﬁcation is prob - lematic . It leads to an incidental parameters problem and inconsistent estimates , a problem not encountered with the Poisson model . Dropping the ﬁxed - effect vec - tors is not a solution either because the omission of relevant variables biases the estimates ( Hausman et al . 1984 ) . The negative binomial conditional ﬁxed - effects model does not have an incidental parameter problem . However , as Allison and Waterman ( 2002 ) highlight , it builds the ﬁxed effects into the distribution of the overdispersion parameter , not the mean . 6 For the Poisson model , the conditional and unconditional ﬁxed - effect estimates coincide ; it is not subject to the incidental D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 152 . 3 . 102 . 242 ] on 03 J a nu a r y 2014 , a t 10 : 37 .

Wooldridge ( 1999 ) shows that the ﬁxed - effects Poisson estimator produces consistent estimates of the parame - ters in a multiplicative , unobserved components panel data model under very general conditions and is robust to serial correlation . 7 Therefore , we use a Poisson ﬁxed - effects speciﬁcation and correct for overdispersion by scaling the model standard errors by the deviance - based dispersion statistic ( Cameron and Trivedi 2005 , Hardin and Hilbe 2007 ) . Results Table 2 shows the ﬁxed - effects Poisson models for the number of new phones introduced each quarter . Model 1 includes only the control variables , whereas Models 2 – 4 add the performance – aspiration gap variables for the corporate and business units . Model 2 includes only the performance variables relevant for the business unit , Model 3 includes only the corporate performance vari - ables , and Model 4 includes performance variables for both the corporate and business unit levels . In Model 1 we ﬁnd that older ﬁrms are relatively inert and less likely to introduce new phone models . Size as measured by number of employees ( but not corporate sales ) has a positive effect on new product introduc - tions , whereas diversiﬁcation seems to have no inﬂu - ence . Although the number of mobile patents seems not to matter for new phone introductions in Model 1 , in subsequent models we ﬁnd that ﬁrms with more patents also have a higher rate of new product introductions . 8 The variables available slack , BU importance , and BU experience have no direct effect on new product intro - ductions . The lack of signiﬁcant results for these mea - sures reﬂects our inclusion of ﬁrm - speciﬁc ﬁxed effects . If we omit those ﬁrm dummies , then the coefﬁcient for available slack is both positive and signiﬁcant , as is the coefﬁcient for BU importance . Absorbed slack has a negative and signiﬁcant sign in Model 1 , a ﬁnding similar to Greve ( 2003a ) , who ﬁnds that a negative sign for absorbed slack impacts innovation launches in the presence of ﬁrm ﬁxed effects . Finally , a likelihood ratio test shows that Model 1 as a whole is signiﬁcant at the 1 % level . Model 2 examines the effect of the performance – aspiration gap above and below the ﬁrm’s aspiration level , where performance is measured in terms of oper - ating proﬁt margins at the business unit level . Accord - ing to Hypothesis 1 , business unit performance below aspirations leads to a greater number of new prod - uct introductions . We obtain a negative and signiﬁcant coefﬁcient for performance below aspirations , support - ing H1 . In other words , as performance deteriorates and the business unit’s operating proﬁt margins move farther away from its aspiration level , the unit increases the rate Table 2 Fixed - Effects Poisson Model of New Phone Introductions Model Variable 1 2 3 4 Performance below É 2 0 682 ⇤ É 2 0 305 ⇤ aspirations 4 1 0 432 5 4 1 0 402 5 ( business unit ) Performance above 2 0 256 2 0 103 aspirations 4 1 0 419 5 4 1 0 374 5 ( business unit ) Performance below 3 0 087 ⇤⇤ 2 0 916 ⇤⇤ aspirations 4 1 0 423 5 4 1 0 412 5 ( corporate unit ) Performance above É 2 0 074 ⇤⇤ É 1 0 922 ⇤⇤ aspirations 4 0 0 978 5 4 0 0 973 5 ( corporate unit ) Age É 0 0 013 ⇤⇤⇤ É 0 0 012 ⇤⇤⇤ É 0 0 011 ⇤⇤⇤ É 0 0 010 ⇤⇤⇤ 4 0 0 004 5 4 0 0 004 5 4 0 0 004 5 4 0 0 004 5 Number of employees 0 0 937 ⇤⇤⇤ 1 0 033 ⇤⇤⇤ 1 0 048 ⇤⇤⇤ 1 0 120 ⇤⇤⇤ 4 0 0 215 5 4 0 0 225 5 4 0 0 213 5 4 0 0 223 5 Corporate sales 0 0 187 0 0 265 0 0 016 0 0 084 4 0 0 335 5 4 0 0 335 5 4 0 0 341 5 4 0 0 343 5 Diversiﬁcation 0 0 149 0 0 098 0 0 069 0 0 028 4 0 0 159 5 4 0 0 159 5 4 0 0 159 5 4 0 0 158 5 Mobile patents 0 0 120 0 0 160 ⇤ 0 0 156 ⇤ 0 0 191 ⇤⇤ 4 0 0 089 5 4 0 0 095 5 4 0 0 086 5 4 0 0 092 5 Available slack 0 0 066 0 0 086 0 0 030 0 0 049 4 0 0 062 5 4 0 0 062 5 4 0 0 061 5 4 0 0 062 5 Absorbed slack É 0 0 469 ⇤ É 0 0 595 ⇤⇤ É 0 0 534 ⇤⇤ É 0 0 633 ⇤⇤ 4 0 0 254 5 4 0 0 258 5 4 0 0 251 5 4 0 0 256 5 BU importance É 0 0 014 É 0 0 015 É 0 0 018 É 0 0 020 4 0 0 018 5 4 0 0 018 5 4 0 0 018 5 4 0 0 018 5 BU experience É 0 0 343 É 0 0 192 É 0 0 364 É 0 0 221 4 0 0 344 5 4 0 0 347 5 4 0 0 335 5 4 0 0 339 5 Constant 6 0 402 ⇤⇤ 5 0 081 8 0 134 ⇤⇤ 6 0 833 ⇤⇤ 4 3 0 259 5 4 3 0 269 5 4 3 0 290 5 4 3 0 318 5 Number of 152 152 152 152 observations Number of ﬁrms 6 6 6 6 Pseudo log - likelihood É 453 . 55 É 449 . 34 É 447 . 21 É 443 . 88 Overall model test 646 . 70 ⇤⇤⇤ 698 . 32 ⇤⇤⇤ 669 . 49 ⇤⇤⇤ 715 . 54 ⇤⇤⇤ 6 degrees of freedom 7 [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] Notes .

Gaba and Joseph : Corporate Structure and Performance Feedback : Aspirations and Adaptation in M - Form Firms Organization Science 24 ( 4 ) , pp . 1102 – 1119 , ©2013 INFORMS 1111 Model 3 adds the two performance – aspiration gap measures for the corporate level to Model 1 . Hypoth - esis 2 predicted that , for corporate performance below aspirations , negative feedback ( i . e . , performance declines ) will lead to fewer new product introductions . The positive and signiﬁcant coefﬁcient for performance below aspirations supports Hypothesis 2 by indicat - ing that , as performance below aspirations declines , so does the rate of new phone introductions . 9 We also ﬁnd that for performance above historical aspirations , perfor - mance improvements result in fewer new product intro - ductions . A likelihood ratio test comparing Models 1 and 3 yields a chi - square test statistic of 12 . 68 ( with 2 degrees of freedom and p = 0 0 001 ) , suggesting a signif - icant improvement in model ﬁt over Model 1 . Model 4 adds the performance – aspiration variables for both corporate and business units . We ﬁnd that the results from Models 2 and 3 continue to be supported : an increase in the performance – aspiration gap for the business ( respectively , corporate ) unit increases ( respec - tively , reduces ) new product introductions . Comparing Model 4 to Models 2 and 3 yields chi - square test statis - tics of 6 . 66 and 10 . 92 , respectively , which are signif - icant at the 5 % and 1 % levels . This suggests that a model that includes performance – aspiration gaps at both the corporate and business unit levels dominates mod - els that include the performance – aspiration gap at only one unit . Overall , our results support the heterogeneity of responses—in terms of new product introductions— to performance – aspiration gaps at multiple levels of the corporate hierarchy . Model 4 also allows us to calculate the magnitude of the effects of performance – aspiration gaps for the cor - porate unit versus the business unit . 10 We calculate the Figure 1 New Product Introductions’ Multiplier Rate Corporate unit Performance – aspiration – 0 . 01 – 0 . 03 – 0 . 05 – 0 . 07 – 0 . 09 – 0 . 11 – 0 . 13 – 0 . 15 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 1 . 1 1 . 2 1 . 3 1 . 4 M u lti p li e r o f r a t e Business unit average marginal effects of changes in the performance – aspiration gap below the aspiration level while holding all other variables at their mean levels . The estimates in Model 4 imply that an increase of one standard devia - tion in the corporate performance – aspiration gap below aspirations reduces the rate of new phone introductions by 6 . 1 % and that a one - standard - deviation increase in this gap for the business unit increases the rate of new phone introductions by 7 . 8 % . Using the Delta method ( Greene 2003 ) to calculate the standard errors of the average marginal effects ( not shown ) , we ﬁnd that each effect is signiﬁcantly different from zero . Figure 1 plots our results based on the coefﬁcient estimates in Model 4 . It shows the multiplier effect of the performance – aspiration gap ( below aspirations ) on new product introductions for the corporate and business units . To facilitate interpretation , in the ﬁgure we set the rate of new product introductions to unity at the ori - gin and vary the gaps over their entire range of values . We ﬁnd that the corporate curve slopes upward whereas the business curve slopes downward . This result implies that declining performance at the ﬁrm level ( moving toward the left on the horizontal axis ) reduces the rate of product introductions but that declining performance in the business unit increases that rate . Next , Hypotheses 3 and 4 state that the effect of a corporate performance – aspirations gap on new prod - uct introductions is moderated by the relative impor - tance and experience of the business unit . In Table 3 , Model 5 interacts the corporate performance – aspiration gap with BU importance while Model 6 interacts that gap with BU experience . In Model 5 , the coefﬁcient for the gap remains positive while that on the interaction term is negative .

Model 6 reveals a similar effect . Performance below aspirations at the corporate level again makes new product introduc - tions less likely , but in this case the effect is attenuated for the more experienced business units . The coefﬁcients for the stand - alone term ( business unit share of oper - ating income in Model 5 and business unit experience in Model 6 ) are not signiﬁcant in either of the two models . 11 In Models 5 and 6 , neither of the interaction terms is signiﬁcant . However , the coefﬁcient and standard error for the interaction term are not particularly informative in nonlinear models . The reason is that , in count mod - els , the effect of the interaction term ( as well as the standard error ) depends not only on the coefﬁcient for the interaction but also on the coefﬁcients for the two main effects and the values of all other variables ( Ai and Norton 2003 ) . As a result , neither sign nor signiﬁ - cance of the interaction coefﬁcients presented in Table 3 is indicative of the actual direction and signiﬁcance of the interactions ( Ai and Norton 2003 , Hoetker 2007 ) . Therefore , in Table 4 we present the attenuating effect of the interaction terms in a more appropriate way ( Greene 2010 ) . That is , we calculate the marginal effects of the performance – aspiration gap ( below aspirations ) at vari - ous levels of BU importance and BU experience . Col - umn ( 1 ) in Table 4 shows the marginal effect of the performance – aspiration gap for the corporate level at seven different levels of the BU importance variable ( at its mean , mean ± one standard deviation , mean ± two standard deviations , and mean ± three standard devi - ations ) . These effects are based on the estimates from Model 5 , and the standard errors are calculated using the Delta method applied to the variance – covariance estimates from that model . We ﬁnd that as BU impor - tance rises from three standard deviations below the mean to three standard deviations above the mean , the marginal effect of performance feedback declines con - sistently .

Column ( 2 ) in Table 4 , which is based on the estimates from Model 6 , like - wise shows that as BU experience increases the marginal effect of the performance – aspiration gap at the corpo - rate level declines , which attests to its attenuating effect . More importantly , this decline in the marginal effect of performance feedback is also statistically signiﬁcant ( comparing and testing the ranking of coefﬁcients in each column as the moderating variable increases over its range ) . We thereby obtain strong support for H3 and H4 , which posit that the negative effects of corporate performance feedback are attenuated for units that are ( respectively ) strategically important and experienced .

Post Hoc Analyses We performed additional post hoc analyses to provide further ( albeit partial ) insights into our ﬁndings . First , we report a comparison of social to historical aspi - rations in Table 5 . Model 1 uses only business unit performance relative to historical aspirations , Model 2 replaces historical with social aspirations , and Model 3 reports performance relative to each of historical and social aspirations . Models 4 – 6 follow this same pattern for corporate instead of business unit performance . The last row in the table reports the Bayesian information criterion ( BIC ) for model selection , which penalizes the model log - likelihood for the number of parameters esti - mated .

Gaba and Joseph : Corporate Structure and Performance Feedback : Aspirations and Adaptation in M - Form Firms 1114 Organization Science 24 ( 4 ) , pp . 1102 – 1119 , ©2013 INFORMS aspirations matters rather than relative to social aspi - rations , a pattern that holds at both the business unit and corporate levels . This ﬁnding also holds whether we look at the coefﬁcient estimates and their signiﬁ - cance or instead use the BIC to select models . BIC is the minimum in Model 1 for the business unit and in Model 4 for corporate . Therefore , this criterion again indicates that performance relative to historical aspi - rations matters . Our models include ﬁrm ﬁxed effects and rely on within - ﬁrm variation to identify coefﬁcients . A decline in corporate performance relative to histor - ical performance within a ﬁrm is indicative of tight - ening resource constraints and suggests an explanation that is not purely behavioral . Real resource constraints are likely to invoke the unilateral responses ( cost con - trols , budget cuts , reorganizations ) suggested by our the - ory . If social aspirations mattered—so that a decline of corporate performance relative to others in the industry reduced new product introductions—then a pure behav - ioral explanation ( i . e . , one based on performance com - parisons with others ) would be more appropriate . Second , our analyses so far have treated all new prod - uct introductions as being essentially similar . Yet not all new phones embody equivalent changes in terms of innovative features ; in fact , most tend to be incremental improvements over earlier models . Therefore , to better understand the implications of novelty in new product introductions in this context , we identiﬁed phones in our sample that incorporate radical or architectural tech - nology improvements ( Henderson and Clark 1990 ) and used this as an alternative dependent variable . Toward that end , we assessed the novelty level of each phone based on its particular features . We used a conserva - tive approach to identify truly novel changes and clas - siﬁed each ﬁrst occurrence of a technology ( e . g . , WiFi , GPS , Web browser ) in a phone introduced by a man - ufacturer as constituting a radical / architectural innova - tion and therefore a riskier launch—in terms of the technology and product market—than incremental prod - ucts ( Henderson and Clark 1990 ) . In all , 30 % of our sample’s phone introductions were classiﬁed as radical . We then performed separate analysis for phone introduc - tions classiﬁed as incremental ; the results are reported in Table 6 . In Table 6 , Model 1 uses all new product introduc - tions as the dependent variable and reproduces Model 4 from Table 2 ; Model 2 uses only incremental new prod - uct introductions as the dependent variable . A compar - ison of these two models reveals that the coefﬁcients are similar in terms of sign , magnitude , and signiﬁ - cance . Model 3 uses only radical new product intro - ductions as the dependent variable . Here , we ﬁnd that the coefﬁcients for performance feedback have the right sign but are not statistically signiﬁcant . Because the count of radical phone introductions shows less varia - tion over time ( ranging from 0 to 5 in the data ) , as a Table 6 Incremental vs .

Gaba and Joseph : Corporate Structure and Performance Feedback : Aspirations and Adaptation in M - Form Firms Organization Science 24 ( 4 ) , pp . 1102 – 1119 , ©2013 INFORMS 1115 performance – aspiration gaps at the business unit and corporate levels affect the likelihood of a radical new phone introduction ; these estimates are reported in Table 6 as Model 4 . Once again , the coefﬁcients for our variables of interest remain insigniﬁcant . Overall , these results suggest that our hypothesized effects apply to incremental but not to radical new product introductions . As noted previously , a business unit that faces declin - ing performance will focus on more incremental prod - uct launches , which draw on existing competencies , to the exclusion of radical product launches , which entail the commitment of more resources and are often out - side the unit’s domain of experience . 12 Interestingly , if we drop the ﬁrm dummies , then corporate performance below aspirations becomes signiﬁcant . Hence there is at least weak evidence that performance deterioration at the corporate level leads also to fewer radical product introductions . Discussion This study’s main objective is to investigate the effects of corporate and business unit performance feedback on business unit adaptation in multidivisional ﬁrms . Specif - ically , we hypothesize and conﬁrm diverging effects of corporate and business unit responses to performance below aspirations on new product introductions . The difference stems from each organizational unit’s reper - toire of responses to address poor performance . Busi - ness units in such cases respond with actions aimed at streamlining operations and increasing revenue in core product market ; these actions naturally accelerate prod - uct commercialization . In contrast , corporate managers focus on external capital market pressures for short - term ﬁrm - level proﬁtability and respond to poor performance accordingly . In such cases the corporate ofﬁce may rely on unilateral actions as budget cuts and structural changes to the corporation . Yet the former may constrain business unit activities and the latter may be disruptive at a time when business unit managers require focus and resources . Furthermore , business units may antic - ipate major budget decrements and consequently limit product changes . Thus the typical corporate responses clearly constrain the business unit’s capacity to introduce new products . Our post hoc analysis enriches the initial ﬁndings . We discover that business unit responses to performance below aspirations affect incremental new product intro - ductions but not radical new product introductions . The reason may be that incremental phones can be rapidly commercialized and are a natural outcome of business unit response repertoires targeted at accelerating down - stream activities . However , radical technologies and fea - tures are more directly affected by the ﬁrm’s resource constraints . At the corporate level , the responses of cost cutting and reducing slack are likely to affect both upstream research and development ( R & D ) and downstream business unit functions . This may explain our ﬁnding evidence for corporate feedback effects on both incremental and radical new product introduc - tions . We also ﬁnd that historical aspirations matter but social aspirations do not , which supports the claim that resource constraints—not social comparisons— drive corporate behavior and thus impede business unit adaptation . We also ﬁnd that the adverse effect of poor cor - porate performance on new product introductions is attenuated for strategically signiﬁcant business units . In other words , the implications of problemistic search for business units that are strategically signiﬁcant tend to converge with that of the corporate ofﬁce . By incorporat - ing the suggestions of strategically signiﬁcant business units , the corporate ofﬁce may locate tactical solu - tions more readily and , in general , exploit the advan - tage of greater operational expertise and knowledge . Also , the business unit may be granted more inﬂuence in corporate decision making and thus be better able to fend off cuts in resources or unwarranted organi - zational changes , thereby limiting the adverse effects of poor corporate performance . Although our study does not provide insights into the exact nature of the exchange between the corporate ofﬁce and the business units , extant research suggests that it may occur through decision - making channels ( Ocasio and Joseph 2005 , Joseph and Ocasio 2012 ) , executive mobility ( Boeker 1997 ) , or greater political clout of business unit man - agers with the corporate ofﬁce ( Bouquet and Birkinshaw 2008 ) . These factors merit greater exploration . Our study offers two main contributions . First , it helps explain how vertically differentiated attention to mul - tiple performance goals within the multidivisional ﬁrm inﬂuences the relationship between performance feed - back and adaptive behavior . Studies that accommodate multiple aspiration levels are in short supply , and we know little of how managers allocate attention in the face of multiple performance goals . Existing studies sug - gest that , to deal with the cognitive overload or political discord engendered by multiple goals , units may need to create a subgoal focus or attend to goals sequen - tially . The horizontal separation of goals ( i . e . , from other divisional goals ) has two principal beneﬁts : ( i ) it helps the ﬁrm manage interdependencies that would other - wise limit its pursuit of multiple performance goals , and ( ii ) it prevents “performance freeze , ” which would limit decision making that could enhance organizational performance across the full array of goals ( Ethiraj and Levinthal 2009 ) . Researchers have shown that function - ally discrete goals increase responsiveness to perfor - mance feedback ( Audia and Sorenson 2001 , Baum et al . 2005 ) , but corporate structure has not—until now—been a consideration in this area of research .

Gaba and Joseph : Corporate Structure and Performance Feedback : Aspirations and Adaptation in M - Form Firms 1116 Organization Science 24 ( 4 ) , pp . 1102 – 1119 , ©2013 INFORMS We propose that , as regards attention paid to goals , vertical differentiation yields outcomes unlike those pre - dicted under horizontal differentiation . Thus , our study uncovers a unique consequence of the corporate struc - ture . In particular , the very nature of performance feedback and problem solving differs as a function of the organizational context , so the level’s response and effect on unit behavioral outcomes differ likewise . That is , the nature of problemistic search depends on the level at which goals are attended to and the level at which responses to performance feedback are enacted . Although Williamson ( 1975 ) and others have noted the virtues of separating strategic and operational decision making , they are not concerned with adaptive change . We remark that , moreover , the foundational M - form work did not consider the interplay between struc - tural drivers and managerial attitudes toward loss . Our results therefore indicate that the organizational hierar - chy and division of labor makes a difference in perfor - mance feedback theory and should be incorporated more directly into future studies of learning . Second , our study augments the literature on the role of corporate headquarters in the adaptation of busi - ness units ( Galunic and Eisenhardt 2001 , Helfat and Eisenhardt 2004 , Ambos and Birkinshaw 2010 , Joseph and Ocasio 2012 ) . Corporate activities ﬁgure largely in attempts to address changes in ﬁrm performance and the environment , and it consists of a continuous pro - cess of adjusting capabilities ( Galunic and Eisnhardt 2001 ) , managing talent ( Karim and Williams 2012 ) , and making strategic choices ( Chakravarthy 1982 ) . For the corporate ofﬁce , responses to poor performance include solutions that have signiﬁcance for the maintenance of the entire organization—even at the expense of a sin - gle unit . The implication that follows from our theory is that corporate problem - solving efforts may encumber activities at the business unit level when doing so is nec - essary to ensure the organization’s survival . Solutions to performance problems often reside at the lowest levels of an organization ( Greve 2003b , p . 148 ) , but corpo - rate preoccupation with the ﬁrm’s overall performance feedback may impede the realization of those lower - level solutions . Only when the business unit can inﬂu - ence the broader realignment of priorities and invest - ments within the ﬁrm ( Bouquet and Birkinshaw 2008 , Ambos and Birkinshaw 2010 ) is there abatement in the adverse effects of the corporate response to poor per - formance . Recent research has examined the effects of business group afﬁliation and corporate diversiﬁcation on responses to feedback ( e . g . , Vissa et al . 2010 , Aime et al . 2012 ) , but more research is needed in this area . Our research has limitations . First , conclusions drawn from studying the mobile device industry should be extrapolated with caution to ﬁrms in other industries . The global mobile device industry has only a few large players , and industries with different competitive dynamics might well yield different results for when cor - porate versus business unit effects dominate . Second , we focus on the corporate response to performance feed - back and its impact on a single business unit within a multidivisional ﬁrm . Top management actually focuses on a host of goals , and the consequences of attention to multiple simultaneous goals at both the corporate and business unit levels should be considered in research on this subject . Future studies may also seek to understand the effects of corporate response repertoires on product output from multiple business units in the ﬁrm’s port - folio , a topic whose exploration was not feasible given the data limitations of this study . Third , even though our analysis seeks explicitly to understand the effects of corporate performance feedback on business unit activ - ities , we do not directly observe the repertoire of cor - porate responses . However , the literature suggests that these levers are diverse in nature and include internal changes to division charters ( Galunic and Eisenhardt 1996 ) , shifts in how resources are allocated ( Noda and Bower 1996 ) , and changes to how costs are allocated ( Burgelman 2002 ) . Our anecdotal evidence is consis - tent with these studies and suggests that the identi - ﬁed responses often occur in combination and involve both major and minor adjustments . Capturing these ﬁne - grained phenomena is a challenge worthy of future research . Our study provides a complement to previous case studies , a basis for future work , and a quantitative longitudinal assessment of corporate responses to a sin - gle unit’s poor performance . Finally , our analysis can provide only limited insight into how single - business ﬁrms would behave . If we extend the logic of the preceding analysis , then our ﬁndings seem to suggest that , as strategically signiﬁ - cant business units become the dominant business of the ﬁrm ( or the only business in the ﬁrm ) , overall respon - siveness to feedback should more closely resemble that of the business unit than of the corporation . Yet there may also be limits to the favorable effect of a business unit voice in corporate decision making . The top man - agement of public ﬁrms with a dominant business are likely to face investor pressures and behave myopically and , in cases of poor performance , to limit long - term investments that could eventually facilitate adaptation . For example , Audia and Greve ( 2006 ) ﬁnd that ﬁrm - level attainment discrepancies ( analogous to our corpo - rate performance – aspiration gaps ) among large Japanese shipbuilders reduce investment in physical assets and employees . In a study of acquisition propensity in a large sample of manufacturing ﬁrms , Iyer and Miller ( 2008 ) ﬁnd evidence that poor ﬁrm - level performance results in fewer acquisitions . Although we cannot deﬁnitively identify the point at which business unit and corporate behaviors converge , we do suggest some levers that may drive their common behavior under such conditions—in particular , the role played by corporate attention in the adaptation of business units .

Gaba and Joseph : Corporate Structure and Performance Feedback : Aspirations and Adaptation in M - Form Firms Organization Science 24 ( 4 ) , pp . 1102 – 1119 , ©2013 INFORMS 1117 Conclusion Given the paradox faced by headquarters—namely , that its actions to improve corporate performance may impede the business unit activities most likely to effect that improvement—it is critical for performance that managers strike a workable balance . In particular , struc - tural differentiation must be balanced by greater cor - porate attention to the divisional effects of tightening resources and to the input that business units can provide on the ﬁrm’s overall agenda . Corporate effects on ﬁrm performance are well documented ( McGahan and Porter 1999 ) , as is the importance of business unit initiatives in strategic adaptation . Less clear are the effects of inte - grating corporate and business units , especially on adap - tive behavior . This study is one step in that direction . Though contrary to the foundational literature , which warns against such integration ( Williamson 1975 ) , our results are consistent with those of scholars who docu - ment a more active role for business units in strategic decision making ( Bouquet and Birkinshaw 2008 , Joseph and Ocasio 2012 ) . In fact , increased integration of the issues and initiatives to which corporate and business units both attend may result in better outcomes to the extent that the resource and information requirements of corporate and divisional managers can be better bal - anced without affecting either group’s functions . These integrative linkages are well suited to aligning perspec - tives on problems , opportunities , and actions in support of adaptive change .

Endnotes 1 We also tried using longer lags for the business unit performance – aspiration gap measure , which yielded qualita - tively similar results . 2 We also experimented with BU size ( measured by business unit sales over corporate sales ) as another indicator of strate - gic signiﬁcance . Using this variable did not yield signiﬁcant results , and including it as an additional control likewise left our ﬁndings unaffected . 3 A control variable for R & D spending was created , but it proved to be always nonsigniﬁcant ( even in the baseline model ) and so was not included in the ﬁnal models . 4 We also evaluated the robustness of our results to the presence of cyclicality in the data . First , we controlled for the growth in sales of mobile phones lagged by 1 – 4 quarters . If cyclicality were present , then we would expect a negative coefﬁcient for sales growth—as sales growth tapers off , it spurs the intro - duction of new phones . We ﬁnd that sales growth lagged four quarters is negative and signiﬁcant . However , we also ﬁnd our results are stronger in terms of both statistical signiﬁcance and the magnitude of the hypothesized coefﬁcients . Second , we used the dependent variable lagged by 1 – 4 quarters as an additional regressor . If new product introductions follow a cyclical pattern , then some ( if not all ) of these lags should have a signiﬁcant effect on concurrent phone introductions . In the fully speciﬁed models , none of the lagged dependent variables signiﬁcantly inﬂuences new product introductions , even as our hypothesized effects remain supported . 5 We calculated variance inﬂation factors ( VIFs ) for each inde - pendent variable . Each factor ( excepting the VIF for corporate sales ) is less than 10 , so multicollinearity is not a major prob - lem for our coefﬁcients of interest . 6 Wooldridge ( 1999 ) shows that parameterization based on a negative binomial distribution is not robust . In particular , specifying a distribution for the conditional mean and the overdispersion parameter—and then maximizing the likelihood with respect to all parameters—generally produces inconsis - tent estimates for the conditional means . 7 Please note that overdispersion does not lead to inconsistent estimates of the coefﬁcients . It simply yields lower standard errors than what they should be . On the other hand , omit - ting relevant ﬁxed effects in a negative binomial speciﬁcation does lead to inconsistent estimates , which is a far more seri - ous problem . Ahuja ( 2000 ) , Azoulay et al . ( 2010 ) , and Singh and Agrawal ( 2011 ) all underscore the appropriateness of a ﬁxed - effects Poisson estimator . 8 Our results are robust to the use of forward patent citations as an alternative measure of capabilities . 9 Performance deteriorations below aspirations at the corporate unit may be perceived as a threat to its survival , which in turn might inﬂuence its responses ( March and Shapira 1992 ) . Therefore , as a robustness check , we added a control for risk of ﬁrm bankruptcy using the Altman Z - measure ( Iyer and Miller 2008 ) . Our results are robust to the inclusion of this additional control . 10 The coefﬁcients in Table 2 can themselves be interpreted as semielasticities . 11 We also interacted the performance feedback variables with corporate sales , diversiﬁcation , and BU size . No consistent patterns were evident for these interaction effects . 12 We reran our analysis using longer lags of the business unit performance – aspiration gap on the likelihood of radical prod - uct introductions . Even at the longer lags , we failed to ﬁnd any signiﬁcant effects . References Abernathy WJ , Utterback J ( 1978 ) Patterns of industrial innovation . Technology Rev . 80 ( 7 ) : 40 – 47 .
