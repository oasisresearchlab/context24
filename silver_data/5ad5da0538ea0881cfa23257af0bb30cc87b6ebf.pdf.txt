Hua 1 , 2 * 1 Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering , University at Buffalo , Buffalo , NY , United States , 2 Department of Physiology and Biophysics , University at Buffalo , Buffalo , NY , United States Local substrate stiffness is one of the major mechanical inputs for tissue organization during its development and remodeling . It is widely recognized that adherent cells use transmembrane proteins ( integrins ) at focal adhesions to translate ECM mechanical cues into intracellular bioprocess . Here we show that epithelial cells respond to substrate stiffening primarily via actin cytoskeleton organization , that requires activation of mechanosensitive Piezo1 channels . Piezo1 Knockdown cells eliminated the actin stress ﬁ bers that formed on stiff substrates , while it had minimal effect on cell morphology and spreading area . Inhibition of Piezo1 channels with GsMTx4 also signi ﬁ cantly reduced stiffness - induced F - actin reorganization , suggesting Piezo1 mediated cation current plays a role . Activation of Piezo1 channels with speci ﬁ c agonist ( Yoda1 ) resulted in thickening of F - actin ﬁ bers and enlargement of FAs on stiffer substrates , whereas it did not affect the formation of nascent FAs that facilitate spreading on the soft substrates . These results demonstrate that Piezo1 functions as a force sensor that couples with actin cytoskeleton to distinguish the substrate stiffness and facilitate epithelial adaptive remodeling . KEYWORDS Piezo1 channels , ECM stiffness , mechanobiology , MDCK cells , focal adhesions , epithelial remolding Introduction Epithelial cells respond to substrate mechanical signals with a continuous remodeling process that maintains epithelial barrier integrity . Hardening of the substrate occurs during changes in physiological states such as aging or due to development of disease states including tumors ( Wells , 2013 ; Semenza , 2016 ) . The variation in local mechanical properties in ﬂ uences many cell behaviors , which alters cell proliferation , differentiation and migration ( Pelham and Wang , 1997 ) . The mechanical inputs at the substate is commonly thought to be transmitted via adhesion proteins such as integrins ( Ingber , 2003 ; Schwartz , 2010 ) . Mechanosensitive Piezo1 protein is found in locations side - by - side with integrins and is sensitive to substrate mechanical properties , suggesting Piezo1 and integrins may collaborate to regulate cell - ECM interactions ( Coste et al . , 2010 ; Coste et al . , 2012 ; Segel et al . , 2019 ) . Tissue cells adapt to changes in local mechanical environments through various structural and morphological rearrangements . Fibroblasts grown on stiffer substrates generated more traction force and exhibited a larger and ﬂ atter morphology compared with soft substrates ( Lo et al . , 2000 ; Yeung et al . , 2005 ) . Epithelial cells develop abundance of actin stress ﬁ bers on hard substrates , that are associated with larger cell expansion , disruption of cell - cell junctions , and upregulation of proliferation ( Kim and Asthagiri , 2011 ; Verma et al . , 2012 ) . In contrast , these cells on soft substrates grow into a tightly OPEN ACCESS EDITED BY Claudia Tanja Mierke , Leipzig University , Germany REVIEWED BY Mingxing Ouyang , Changzhou University , China Mercedes Costell , University of Valencia , Spain Andrew Doyle , National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , United States Sean Sun , Johns Hopkins University , United States * CORRESPONDENCE Susan Z .

Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 01 TYPE Original Research PUBLISHED 24 May 2023 DOI 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2023 . 1198109 connected cell sheet with strong adhesion protein expression ( E - cadherin and ZO - 1 ) along the cell periphery , that overlaps with peripheral F - actin ( Kim and Asthagiri , 2011 ; Balcioglu et al . , 2020 ) . Mechanical properties of substrates also markedly in ﬂ uence cell migration and cells exhibit higher mobility and move velocity on stiffer substrates ( Pathak and Kumar , 2012 ; Nasrollahi et al . , 2017 ) . Piezo1 channels are sensitive to a range of substrate mechanical properties including con ﬁ nements via micropatterns and local ECM hardening ( Segel et al . , 2019 ; Emig et al . , 2021 ; Jetta et al . , 2021 ) . In the brain , substrate stiffness alters the ratio of neurons to astrocytes during neural stem cell differentiation via Piezo1 activities ( Pathak et al . , 2014 ) . A recent study discovered that age - related substrate stiffening changed thebehaviorof oligodendrocyteprogenitorcells , resulting inadeclinein tissue regeneration ( Segel et al . , 2019 ) . Inhibiting Piezo1 superseded the hardening effects and recovered the functional activity of aged cells ( Segel et al . , 2019 ) . In epithelia , Piezo1 was overexpressed at the cell edges of sparse regions , which triggered rapid cell division promoting epithelial con ﬂ uence ( Gudipaty et al . , 2017 ) . In brain tumor cells , tissue stiffening promoted Piezo1 overexpression , that increased glioma aggression through Piezo1 mediated ion conductance ( Chen et al . , 2018 ) . Substrate stiffening triggers Piezo1 mediated Ca 2 + in ﬂ ux , that modulates Piezo1 activity enhances actin polymerization in cells ( Atcha et al . , 2021 ) . It has been reported that traction forces alone could activate Piezo1 to generate local Ca 2 + ﬂ ickers in neural stem cells ( Ellefsen et al . , 2019 ) . Piezo1 mediated Ca 2 + in ﬂ ux promotes RhoA / ROCK actomyosin contractility critical for F - actin assembly and myotube formation ( Tsuchiya et al . , 2018 ) . Piezo1 mediated Ca 2 + in ﬂ ux at focal adhesions has been shown to trigger various Ca 2 + - dependent signaling pathways , altering cell morphology , reorganization , and migration ( McHugh et al . , 2010 ; Chen et al . , 2018 ) . Piezo1 may also have effects beyond its role as an ion channel . Cells become stiffer when grown on hard substrate , which required an increase in Piezo1 expression level but not ion in ﬂ ux ( Emig et al . , 2021 ) . In this study , we examined remodeling of MDCK cells on a range of substratum stiffness . The role of Piezo1 is studied by knockdown of Piezo1 with miRNA and by inhibiting Piezo1 activity with speci ﬁ c pharmacological inhibitor GsMTx4 . We show that Piezo1 is involved in the formation of thick actin stress ﬁ bers that together with mature FAs facilitate cell expansion on hard substrates , while it has subtle effect on cell spreading that only involves nascent FAs on soft substrates . Knockdown of Piezo1 with miRNA or inhibiting Piezo1 channels resulted in signi ﬁ cant reduction in F - actin intensity in the cell interior , so that cells lost the distinction of hard and soft substrates . The results suggest that Piezo1 functions as a sensor for stiffness and actin cytoskeleton is part of this sensing apparatus . Materials and methods Modi ﬁ cation of substrate stiffness The PDMS substrates of varying stiffness were made from Sylgard 184 and Sylgard 527 ( Dow Corning ) . The stiffness of the substrates was modi ﬁ ed by varying ratios of elastomer base to curing agent targeting three regions , hard : ~ 1 MPa , medium : ~ 50 kPa ( Balaban et al . , 2001 ) , soft : < 5 kPa ( Moraes et al . , 2015 ) . Glass coverslips ( ~ 1 GPa ) were used for comparison ( Supplementary Table S1 ) . For the experiments , two - well ( 3 mm diameter ) chips were made by bonding a PDMS compartment on coverslip . PDMS mixtures were placed into the wells and cured for 24 h at room temperature . To separate the effect of surface chemical variation from mechanical properties , all substrates were treated with ﬁ bronectin ( 50 μ g / ml ) in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and incubated for 45 min prior to experiments . Cell morphology evaluation The spreading area of each cell was quanti ﬁ ed using ImageJ ( NIH ) with MATLAB plugin . Brie ﬂ y , bright ﬁ eld images were imported to MATLAB and converted to binary images , and individual cells were identi ﬁ ed using built - in “ adaptive threshold . ” The images were processed with several erosions and dilations to clearly de ﬁ ne the cell boundary . The binary images were then transferred back to ImageJ and the cell areas were measured . F - actin thickness was measured using Plot Pro ﬁ le in ImageJ . Focal adhesions were selected manually and analyzed using ImageJ . Multiple cells were selected from each image and multiple images were used . A minimum of 4 experiments were performed under each condition . Cell culture and transfection Madin - Darby Canine Kidney ( MDCK ) cells ( ATCC ) were grown to con ﬂ uence in Dulbecco ’ s Modi ﬁ ed Eagle Medium ( DMEM ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum , 1 % penicillin and streptomycin . The cells were trypsinized and seeded in the wells and allowing to grow for 30 min in the incubator . The cells were then washed with media that removed unattached cells and grown for additional 2 h . Live cell imaging were conducted in a stage - top incubator ( INUB - ZILCSD - F1 - LU , Tokai Hit Co . , Ltd . , Japan ) , maintained at 37 ° C and 5 % CO 2 . No - phenol Red DMEM media with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Gibco , TX ) was used for ﬂ uorescence imaging to reduce the background illumination . Isotonic saline solution was used for experiments with GsMTx4 and Gd 3 + , as it was known that culture media reduced the ef ﬁ ciency of the peptide ( Bae et al . , 2011 ) . Piezo1 knockdown was performed using previously validated Piezo1 miRNA targeting Piezo1 and co - expressed with EGFP to verify transfection ( Jetta et al . , 2019 ) . Cells were cultured to ~ 60 % con ﬂ uence and transfected with plasmid DNA miRNA ( 0 . 4 µg ) using Effectene ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) at 1 : 50 DNA to effectene ratio . Cells were incubated in the transfection media for another 48 h prior to experiments . The transfection ef ﬁ ciency was ~ 25 % . Immunostaining Cells were ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min , and permeabilized with Triton X - 100 ( 0 . 1 % in PBS ) for 15 min , followed by blocking with 5 % Goat Serum ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 1 h at room temperature . For staining paxillin , blocking buffer , made with 5 % Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 02 Jetta et al . 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2023 . 1198109 Goat Serum and 0 . 01 % Triton in PBS was used for diluting primary and secondary antibodies . Cells were incubated with primary antibody , Anti - Paxillin ( BDB610052 , Fischer Scienti ﬁ c ) , at 1 : 50 dilution overnight at 4 ° C and secondary antibody , Alexa ﬂ uor 488 ( A11001 - Thermo Fischer ) at 1 : 200 for 1 h at room temperature . F - actin was stained with Phalloidin Alexa Flour 568 ( A12380 , Fischer Scienti ﬁ c ) at 1 : 100 in PBS and was incubated at room temperature for 1 h . After every step , cells were washed three times with PBS . Imaging was done in slow fade Gold Anti - fade Reagent ( 1 : 100 , Invitrogen ) in PBS to protect from photobleaching . Images were acquired using an inverted microscope ( Axiovert 200M , Zeiss ) with a CCD camera ( AxioCam , Zeiss ) . Fluorescence images were obtained with two ﬁ lter sets : ( Ex : 470 / 40 nm ; Em : 525 / 50 nm ) and ( Ex : 550 / 25 , Em : 605 / 70 ) , and a ×63 oil immersion objective . The B / W images were obtained using a ×20 objective . Ca 2 + measurements Cytosolic Ca 2 + was measured using Ca 2 + sensitive dye , Fluo - 4 AM ( 5 μ M , Invitrogen ) . The normalized Ca 2 + intensity was calculated using Δ F F 0 (cid:1) F − F 0 F 0 , where F and F 0 are the mean ﬂ uorescence intensities of individual cells at time t and t = 0 , respectively . Solution and chemicals GsMTx4 was puri ﬁ ed and diluted in saline to a ﬁ nal concentration of 5 μ M . Yoda1 ( Tocris Bioscience ) was dissolved in DMSO as stock solution ( 48 mM ) , then diluted in saline to a ﬁ nal concentration of 25 µM . Gadolinium chloride ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) was freshly prepared and diluted to 20 µM in saline . Statistical analysis The data is shown as the mean ± standard error of the means ( s . e . m . ) . Statistical analysis was performed using two sample t - test , and value of p < 0 . 05 was considered statistically signi ﬁ cant . Results Substrate stiffness primarily modulates actin cytoskeleton To investigate the effect of local mechanical properties , we cultured MDCK cells on four different substrates , glass , hard , medium - soft and soft with stiffness ranging from ~ 1 GPa to ~ 5 Pa ( Supplementary Table S1 ) . Cells spread to a full extent on all substrates within 3 h , and showed hexagonal / polygonal shape , typical for epithelial cells ( Figure 1A ) . The spreading area of individual cells varies slightly depending on the substrate stiffness . Cells spread to larger area ( ~ 20 % ) on glass and hard substrates compared with the soft substrates ( Figures 1A , C ) . However , the organization and amount of actin ﬁ bers vary drastically on different substrates . On stiffer substrates , glass and hard , cells developed high density actin stress ﬁ bers across the cell body that extends to cell protrusions ( yellow arrows , Figure 1B ) . On soft substrates , the actin ﬁ bers arranged along the cell periphery to form a ring - shape boundary and there was no stress ﬁ ber like structure in the cell interior ( blue arrows , Figure 1B ) . The amount of F - actin was quanti ﬁ ed by the mean ﬂ uorescence intensity of cell interior and normalized with the mean intensity of whole cell , showing that interior F - actin intensity is greater for the hard substrates compared with soft ones ( Figure 1E ) . The actin ﬁ bers were quanti ﬁ ed by the thickness and number of ﬁ bers in individual cells , which shows that both thickness and number of ﬁ bers are signi ﬁ cantly greater on stiffer substrates ( Figures 1F , G , * p < 0 . 001 ) . The percentage of attached cells was lower on soft substrates ( Figure 1D , * p < 0 . 001 ) , and only attached cells were used for analysis . This result indicates actin cytoskeleton are sensitive and responsive to the stiffness of the substrates . Piezo1 is essential for detection of substrate stiffness MDCK cells endogenously express mechanosensitive Piezo1 , that can be activated by changes in membrane tension or ﬂ uid shear stress ( Gudipaty et al . , 2017 ; Jetta et al . , 2019 ) . To assess whether Piezo1 is responsible for detection of substrate stiffness , we knockdown Piezo1 with miRNA , and observed the cell shape and actin reorganization with varying substrate stiffness . Cells were transfected with Piezo1 miRNA and co - expressed with EGFP to verify transfection ( green , SM Supplementary Figure S1 ) . Piezo1 knockdown ( P1KD ) cells showed signi ﬁ cantly lowintensity of actin ﬁ bersinthecellinterioronall substrates ( Figure 2A ) . These cells developed F - actin rings along the cell periphery on hard and glass substrates . In contrast , the nearby control cells ( non - transfected ) , showed strong actin stress ﬁ bers ( red arrows , Figure2A ) . Piezo1knockdownappearedtohavesubtleeffectoncellson soft substrates ( Figure 2A ) . The thickness of actin ﬁ bers in P1KD cells was measured and compared with the control cells , which shows Piezo1 knockdown reduced the ﬁ ber thickness signi ﬁ cantly on stiffer substrates ( Figure 2B , * p < 0 . 001 , * * p < 0 . 05 ) . The stress ﬁ bers in P1KD cells were diminished ( Figure 2C , * p < 0 . 001 , * * p < 0 . 05 ) . The F - actin intensity in interior of the P1KD cells is also reduced signi ﬁ cantly ( Figure 2D , n = 30 for all , * p < 0 . 001 ) . However , the cell shape was not altered , nor the spreading area ( Figure 2E , n = 50 for glass and hard , n = 40 for soft , * * p < 0 . 05 ) . This result indicates that Piezo1 along with actin cytoskeleton forms a vital force transduction apparatus in epithelial cells . Inhibition of Piezo1 current eliminates cytoskeleton response To assess if Piezo1 mediated cation current is needed for cell remodeling on hard substrates , we blocked the channels using Piezo1 speci ﬁ c inhibitor , GsMTx4 . On hard substrates , inhibiting Piezo1 signi ﬁ cantly reduced the actin stress ﬁ bers in the cell interior , but it has little effect ( < 10 % ) on cell spreading ( Figures 3A , C ) . Some F - actin appeared in punctuated form in the cell interior after treatment . On soft substrates , neither actin organization nor the cell area were altered by Piezo1 inhibition ( Figures 3A , C ) . We Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 03 Jetta et al . 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2023 . 1198109 quanti ﬁ ed the thickness and number of actin ﬁ bers in cells and found that inhibiting Piezo1 channels reduced the ﬁ ber thickness and the number of stress ﬁ bers signi ﬁ cantly ( Figures 3D , E , * p < 0 . 001 ) . As controls , we used non - speci ﬁ c mechanosensitive channel ( MSC ) inhibitor Gd 3 + to inhibit all MSCs . The interior actin stress ﬁ bers were eliminated in all cells . The cell spreading area was also moderately reduced in the presence of Gd 3 + , it is because some cells started to shrink under the treatment of the drug for 2 . 5 h . Thus , Piezo1 mediated Ca 2 + current is necessary in stiffness triggered F - actin reorganization . We have previously shown that cell expansion requires opening of Piezo1 channels with Ca 2 + in ﬂ ux that leads to activation of Rho - ROCK pathway ( Jetta et al . , 2021 ) . This result is consistent with previous ﬁ ndings , and further shows that Piezo1 mediated Ca 2 + signal is involved in cell sensing of stiffness . Piezo1 activation enhances actin ﬁ bers and FAs We evaluated the effect of stiffness on focal adhesions by immunostaining Paxillin , a protein located in the focal adhesion complex . We found that FA enlargement was strictly modi ﬁ ed by the stiffness . Cells developed large mature FAs on stiffer substrates , that were aligned with stress ﬁ bers at the ends ( yellow arrows , Figure 4A , Control panel ) . Some short FAs also exist , however , those FAs were located in the middle of the cell or dissociated with the stress ﬁ bers ( not shown ) . The FAs are also present in Piezo1 knockdown cells , although the size of the FAs is much smaller ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . P1KD only reduced the number of FAs slightly ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . On soft substrates , the FAs were much smaller and shorter compared FIGURE 1 Effect of substrate stiffness on cell spreading and F - actin organization . ( A ) : MDCK cells grown on substrates of varying stiffness for 2 . 5 h .

Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 04 Jetta et al . 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2023 . 1198109 with those on hard substrates , and they were distributed along the cell periphery . Interestingly , these FAs are mostly radial although they are not associated with stress ﬁ bers ( blue arrows , Figure 4A ) . We measured the size of FAs and found that the mean FA size on glass and hard substrates are signi ﬁ cantly larger than that on soft substrate ( Figure 4E , * p < 0 . 001 ) . The stiffness had minimal effect on the number of FAs in individual cells ( Figure 4F ) . These results show that cell spreading was facilitated by two stage of FAs , mature FAs that couple with stress ﬁ bers to transmit traction forces , and nascent FAs that are linked to actin mesh providing guidance for spreading . Small nascent FAs located at the lamellipodium edge can facilitate cell spreading without stress ﬁ bers facilitated traction forces . We then evaluated the role of Piezo1 on F - actin and FAs with Piezo1 agonist , Yoda1 . Yoda1 was added to the culture media at 1 h after seeding the cells , and cells were ﬁ xed and co - stained at 2 . 5 h . Yoda1 treated cells showed thicker actin ﬁ bers and larger mature FAs compared with control cells , while the organization of actin and FAs remain the same ( Figure 4A ) . Statistical analysis shows that ﬁ ber thickness increased on all substrates after Yoda1 treatment ( Figure 4B , * p < 0 . 001 , * * p < 0 . 05 ) , while the number of ﬁ bers did not show signi ﬁ cant change ( Figure 4C ) . The enhancement of actin ﬁ bers and FAs did not result in a signi ﬁ cant increase in cell area ( Figure 4D ) . FA sizes increased moderately on stiffer substrates after Yoda1 treatment ( Figure 4E ) . On soft substrates , the effect of Yoda1 on size and number of FAs per cell is negligible ( Figure 4F ) . The existence of nascent FAs at cell protrusions provided the guidance for cells expansion . These FAs were never grown to mature even in the fully spreading cells on soft substrate . Discussion Epithelial cells can detect and continuously adapt to substrate mechanical environments . In this study , we have shown that mechanosensitive Piezo1 is coupled with actin cytoskeleton to detect the stiffness and facilitate the adaptive response in MDCK cells . These cells form abundant thick parallel actin bundles on stiffer substrates , which reorganize to a peripheral actin ring on soft substrates . Piezo1 knockdown cells lost their differentiation of stiffness on different substrates and showed a uniform FIGURE 2 Reduction of F - actin intensity in Piezo1 Knockdown cells .

Inhibition of Piezo1 channels with speci ﬁ c inhibitor signi ﬁ cantly reduced the cell response . This indicates that Piezo1 mediated cation currents , possibly Ca 2 + in ﬂ ux , plays an essential role . Activation of Piezo1 with speci ﬁ c agonist ( Yoda1 ) enhanced the thick F - actin ﬁ bers and maturation of FAs on stiffer substrates , while having subtle effect in cell spreading areas . Thus , Piezo1 and actin cytoskeleton are essential force transduction elements in this sensing apparatus . It is well known that stiffness of extracellular substrates can modulate cell adhesion , spreading , and division . Previous studies have shown that cells grown on stiffer substrates spread to larger area , while cells on soft substrates spread to a lesser extent ( Discher et al . , 2005 ; Geiger et al . , 2009 ) . However , the stiffness has shown a minimal effect on the spreading area in MDCK cells , the effect is mainly on the deployment of actin organization and associated FA distribution ( Figure 1 ) . Cells developed high density parallel stress ﬁ bers on stiffer substrates while they have peripheral F - actin rings on soft substrates ( Figure 1 ) . Cells also exhibited mature FAs on stiffer substrates , that are further enhanced by Piezo1 agonist ( Figure 4 ) . Knockdown of Piezo1 results in disassembly of actin bundles in the cell interior and nascent FAs ( Figure 2 ; Supplementary Figure S2 ) . The cells thus , lost their sensitivity to local stiffness . The role of Piezo1 in facilitating extracellular matrix mechanics has been observed in various cells . In human atrial ﬁ broblasts , cell stiffness increased when grown on stiffer substrate , that required increase in Piezo1 expression level but not ion in ﬂ ux ( Emig et al . , 2021 ) . Increase in Piezo1 expression level led to the formation of thick actin bundles increasing the stiffness of human atrial ﬁ broblasts ( Emig et al . , 2021 ) . In macrophages , substrate stiffening triggers Piezo1 mediated Ca 2 + in ﬂ ux , that promotes actin polymerization and modulates macrophage activation ( Atcha et al . , 2021 ) . In human foreskin ﬁ broblast cells , Yao et al . ( 2022 ) has shown that Piezo1 is required for FA maturation , and these proteins colocalize with FAs and enhance their maturation in a force - dependent manner . This is consistent with our observations in MDCK cells , where cells developed mature FAs only on hard substrates and Piezo1 agonist promoted FA growth ( Figure 4 ) . Piezo1s can be activated by changes in membrane tension to transport Ca 2 + ( Gudipaty et al . , 2017 ) , and they may also functions besides acting as a cation channel , which involves FIGURE 3 Effect of Piezo1 inhibitors on F - actin organization .

Piezo1 proteins have multiple locations in MDCK cells , from the nuclear envelope to the cell membranes , and they can translocate following a tension gradient ( Gudipaty et al . , 2017 ) . Our results show that agonist incited Ca 2 + level was much higher on the hard substrates compared with soft substrates ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) , indicating that more Piezo1s were located on the cell membranes on stiffer substrates . Inhibiting Piezo1 current with speci ﬁ c inhibitor GsMTx4 considerably reduced the F - actin ﬂ uorescence intensity on stiffer substrates ( Figure 3 ) . Conversely , activation of Piezo1 with agonist Yoda1 signi ﬁ cantly enhanced the intensity of thick actin ﬁ bers ( Figure 4 ) , indicating that Piezo1 mediated Ca 2 + in ﬂ ux is involved . Increasing substrate stiffness resulted in an increase in traction forces in adherent cells ( Riveline et al . , 2001 ; By ﬁ eld et al . , 2009 ; Califano and Reinhart - King , 2010 ) . Piezo1s can be activated by myosin II mediated traction force to generate local Ca 2 + ﬂ ickers at focal adhesions ( Ellefsen et al . , 2019 ) . The Piezo1 mediated Ca 2 + in ﬂ ux , in turn , promotes RhoA / FIGURE 4 RoleofPiezo1 in focaladhesion development onvarioussubstrates .

We and others have previously shown that inhibiting the Rho - ROCK pathway reversibly inhibited F - actin assembly in MDCK cells ( Ye et al . , 2014 ; Jetta et al . , 2021 ) . Therefore , Piezo1 sensing function is achieved via Ca 2 + dependent Myosin - II activated actin stress ﬁ ber polymerization in epithelial cells . On the soft substrates cells exhibited a signi ﬁ cant reorganization of F - actin , however , their spreading areas were only slightly reduced . Interestingly , knockdown Piezo1 or inhibiting the channels ’ current showed no effect on cell spreading area on various stiffness spanning a broad range ( Figure 3 ) . This result indicates that substantial increase in stress ﬁ bers and contractile forces may not be necessary for cell expansion in epithelial cells . Detailed examination of FAs on various substrates shows that cell spreading on soft substrates was facilitated by the small nascent FAs , that never reached a mature size during cell expansion ( Figure 4 ) . These nascent FAs exist even in Piezo1 knockdown cells ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . At low stiffness ( less than 5 kPa ) , F - actin can exist in the form of a cortical mesh with no stress ﬁ bers ( Solon et al . , 2007 ) . Cells exhibit low - density small FAs ( Gerardo et al . , 2019 ) , and these FAs can grow with largely reduced myosin - II contraction forces ( Oakes et al . , 2012 ) . A recent study showed that effective forces on a larger FA is reduced during its expansion , and nascent adhesions on soft substrate is an energetically favored state ( Solowiej - Wedderburn and Dunlop , 2022 ) . Thus , substantial forces arising from substrate stiffness regulate the F - actin assembly but may not be necessary for cell spreading . In conclusion , the mechanosensitive Piezo1 modulates F - actin assembly and arrangement , the coupling of Piezo1 and actin cytoskeleton provides a sensing apparatus for substrate stiffness .
