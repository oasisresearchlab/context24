In fact , these adhesive structures do not only physically anchor cells , but they also induce vital intracellular signaling at cell - matrix adhesion sites . Recent progress in the cell adhesion ﬁ eld is now starting to provide data and ideas how this so far enigmatic signaling process is induced and regulated by intracellular acto - myosin tension , or stiffness of the extracellular matrix . Understanding how cells are using this mechanosignaling system will be key to control biological processes such as development , cancer growth , metastasis formation and tissue regeneration .

Introduction Chemical reactions are essential for biological functions , and molecular interactions are needed for the chemical reactions to take place . Compartmentalization or restriction to membrane surfaces increases the local concentration and thus facilitates protein – protein or protein – peptide interactions , creating protein complexes with speci ﬁ c cellular functions . For adherent cells , ﬂ uid shear forces and mechanical cues generated by motor proteins and tissue deformation are important elements of the signaling ma - chinery , constantly modifying the structure and function of the proteins . In turn , mechanical strain on a protein network requires proteins to act as cross - linkers , or softeners to either reinforce or destabilize the mechanical scaffold . Cells have mechanisms to sense the strain or compliance of the extracellular scaffold , as well as to detect shear forces acting on its force - bearing structures such as cytoskeleton , cell – cell and cell – matrix adhesions . A critical as - pect of such sensing mechanisms is the conversion of a mechanical force into local ( chemical ) signaling , that will induce cell behavior to counteract the mechanical challenge or to modulate cell - Contents lists available at ScienceDirect journal homepage : www . elsevier . com / locate / yexcr Experimental Cell Research http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . yexcr . 2015 . 10 . 027 0014 - 4827 / & 2015 Elsevier Inc .

Integrin - receptor containing cell – matrix adhesion sites are among the most complex but also highly versatile mechanosen - sing systems . Cell – matrix adhesions enable cells to monitor their adhesive state , as well as rapidly respond to changes in mechanical tension or shear forces by modulation of cellular adhesion and migration . All multicellular organisms require this sensing system to maintain the architecture and homeostasis of tissues and or - gans . Thus we may predict that any relevant signaling system in - volved in the regulation of cell growth , shape and migration is interfacing with the integrin - dependent mechanosignaling found in cell – matrix adhesion sites . So far , only a small fraction of its regulatory potential has been identi ﬁ ed and for only a few of its components , the details at the molecular level are known . Here we would like to describe emerging concepts , explaining the cellular mechanosensing in cell – matrix adhesions ( aka focal adhesions ) at the molecular level . Our aim is not only to describe the well - proven functions , but also to speculate about possible poorly characterized mechanisms involved . 2 . Biological phenomena in mechanosensing and how me - chanosignaling controls cell behavior Mechanosensing at cell – matrix adhesion sites is at the origin of durotaxis , a mechanism describing the ability of cells to migrate towards a stiffer surface [ 1 ] . A potentially similar effect is seen when cells are plated on a nanostructured gradient of integrin peptide ligands [ 2 ] , where a cellular response is directed uphill . Cells also respond to externally applied stress by changing their adhesion sites [ 3 ] and stress ﬁ ber orientation [ 4 ] . For example , endothelial cells exposed to a ﬂ uid shear stress reorient their cy - toskeleton , which is associated with Rho - family GTPase - mediated intracellular signaling [ 5 ] . Cyclic stretching of ﬁ broblasts plated on an elastic membrane induces remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton , but also stress induced expression of the non - adhesive extra - cellular matrix protein tenascin - C [ 6 ] . Interestingly , this stress - mediated response requires mechanical coupling of cells to ﬁ - bronectin , but leads to the expression of tenascin - C that in turn reduces cell - adhesion and enhances motility of cells [ 7 ] . This de - monstrates that the ECM and its speci ﬁ c composition is an integral part of the integrin - dependent mechanosensing of cells . The role of the ECM in the mechanosensing also includes growth factors , such as TGF - β that can be released from their latent and matrix - bound forms in response to tension transmitted via integrins [ 8 ] . This indirect mechanosignaling pathway provides further insights into signaling mechanisms that require integrin - mediated stretching and remodeling of ECM proteins . Alternatively , matrix - bound but not soluble growth factors induce robust wound heal - ing [ 9 ] , or synergies with integrin - dependent adhesion [ 10 ] , sug - gesting that mechanosignaling is also very important for the reg - ulation of the integrin / receptor tyrosine kinase interface . During cancer initiation , growth and migration , extracellular matrix deposition and stiffness modi ﬁ es cell fate and behavior . While a stiffer ECM induces dedifferentiation of mammary gland epithelial cells [ 11 ] , cancer cells can use amoeboid like move - ments , potentially induced by paxillin stimulated , RhoA - mediated contractility [ 12 ] , making them less dependent on the physical state of the extracellular scaffold . On the other hand , melanoma cells are also able to escape inhibitor treatment by initiating a ri - gidity sensing - response involving focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) [ 13 ] . Recently , another mechanism of tension - mediated signaling has been proposed to be implemented by the increased expression of cell surface mucins . A highly hydrated mucin layer on the cell surface is acting like a hydrodynamic spring to push cells away from the ECM scaffold , thereby reinforcing the mechanical link and signaling output of integrin - mediated cell – matrix adhesions [ 14 ] . Tension - induced signaling within focal adhesions is best seen when staining cells with phosphotyrosine antibodies [ 15 ] . Sub - sequent signaling - mediated maturation of cell – matrix adhe - sions has long been observed in adherent cells in culture . When plated on rigid surfaces , the stronger the intracellular tension , the bigger the cell – matrix adhesions become [ 16 ] . Alternatively , ma - turation of focal or nascent adhesions occurs in response to ex - tracellular as well as intracellular acto - myosin tension [ 3 , 17 ] . An increase in mechanical tension on cell – matrix adhesions induces the recruitment of paxillin and FAK , a process dependent on the focal adhesion scaffold , occurring even after extraction of mem - branes [ 18 ] . More recent proteomics studies [ 19 ] con ﬁ rm this tension - mediated recruitment of LIM - domain containing proteins such as paxillin and zyxin , suggesting that LIM - domains form a molecular structure sensitive to tension induced revelation of binding sites in the actin cytoskeleton [ 20 ] or within cell – matrix adhesion sites [ 21 ] . Although paxillin and Hic - 5 are differentially orchestrating intracellular signaling and cytoskeletal remodeling [ 12 ] , a mechanism to their tension - mediated recruitment to cell – matrix adhesions has only recently been proposed [ 21 ] ( see below ) . The combination of cell surface patterning and stem cell re - search has opened a new dimension of mechanosensing , where an apparent match between substrate stiffness and physiological contractility of cells is searched [ 22 ] . The amount of available surface for cellular attachment has also an impact on differentia - tion towards osteoblasts or adipocytes [ 23 ] , which is apparently linked to the activation of the YAP / TAZ transcription factors [ 24 ] . A key role in mechanosignaling is seen during directed cell migration . Cell detachment and steering at the cell rear requires myosin contraction [ 25 ] . Apparently , induction of paxillin - medi - ated recruitment of FAK / src kinases at cell – matrix adhesions reg - ulates adhesion turnover and cell detachment , which allows cell migration [ 26 , 27 ] . In order to illustrate the molecular mechanisms involved in cellular mechanosensing , we focus on a few proteins important for this process , namely ﬁ bronectin , integrin , paxillin / FAK and talin . With these examples it is possible to get an insight into the re - pertoire of functions employed during mechanoregulation . 3 . Talin – primary mechanosensor or just a structural scaffold ? Talin is a cytoplasmic adapter protein capable of directly con - necting integrins to the actin cytoskeleton . Talin consists of an N - terminal head domain ( (cid:1) residues 1 – 430 ) responsible for in - tegrin binding , which has homology to FERM proteins . Talin rod domain ( (cid:1) residues 430 – 2500 ) consists solely of α - helices , which are packed into bundles of 4 – 5 helices [ 28 ] . The rod domain contains actin binding site as well as a dimerization domain at the C - terminal end of the protein . The rod has also up to 13 binding sites for vinculin , up to 3 binding sites for RIAM and also putative binding sites for integrin , paxillin and possibly also for several other proteins [ 29 ] . One could thus consider talin a large scaf - folding protein . Talin has however unique mechanosensory characteristics : the activity and functions of talin are regulated at several levels and mechanical cues appear to play signi ﬁ cant roles in talin interac - tions and function in cells . First of all , talin autoinhibition is holding the protein in a resting . inactive state until released by synergistic actions of RIAM binding [ 30 ] and lipid interactions [ 31 , 32 ] ( Fig . 1 ) . Subsequent talin – integrin interaction is tightly linked to integrin activation , a process essential for the formation V . P . Hytönen , B . Wehrle - Haller / Experimental Cell Research ∎ ( ∎∎∎∎ ) ∎∎∎ – ∎∎∎ 2 Please cite this article as : V . P . Hytönen , B .

At this stage , talin forms a relatively weak bond to integrin [ 33 , 34 ] , which , however is essential for the mechanosignaling and cellular func - tions , including migration . The second level of regulation involves mechano - controlled opening of the binding sites within the talin rod domain . This process has been studied by using steered molecular dynamics , applying mechanical stress to talin rod fragments [ 35 , 36 ] , by magnetic tweezers studying the vinculin binding to talin rod un - der applied force [ 37 ] , by AFM exploring the unfolding pathways [ 37 ] and by high - resolution ﬂ uorescence microscopy determining the length of talin molecule in living cells [ 38 ] . These studies have revealed that the length of the talin rod increases due to me - chanical stress and that extension of talin rod exposes binding sites for other proteins , including vinculin , which is the best characterized talin partner so far . Therefore , talin appears to be a key molecule in focal adhesion maturation , capable of turning mechanical cues to biochemical signals via exposure of binding sites ( Fig . 1 ) . Finally , talin is also involved in the dissociation of cell – matrix adhesions . This may involve unbinding of interaction partners and release of integrin and actin interactions , post - translational mod - i ﬁ cations , but also proteolytic relaxation of the system . Cleavage of talin in between head and rod domains by calpain appears to have relevance at least in cell culture [ 39 ] . Although talin is studied extensively , the mechanosignaling of talin is still poorly understood . The presence of multiple binding sites for several different proteins within talin rod makes it a fascinating example of a force - modulated protein : talin appears to be capable of adopting several different functions and thus acting as a primary mechanosensor in living cells . 4 . Integrins are mechanosensory receptors on cell surfaces As discussed above , talin takes a key position within cell – ma - trix adhesions , providing a dynamic link to the actin cytoskeleton , while connecting to cell surface receptors of the integrin family , thereby enabling mechanical linkage to the ECM scaffold . Once the ECM / integrin / talin / F - actin link is formed , signaling competent adapter proteins , such as paxillin are recruited in a tension - de - pendent manner . To understand how this relay is working we need to discuss both the ECM – integrin , as well as integrin – talin linkage in detail . Integrins are heterodimeric , allosterically controlled cell surface receptors that exist in different conformational states ( Fig . 1 ) . These conformational states are in ﬂ uenced by ECM - ligand binding to the ectodomain , as well as talin and kindlin binding to the cy - toplasmic tail of the β - integrin tail . Additional regulatory me - chanisms have evolved to control the ECM and talin linkage that Fig . 1 . Regulation of protein conformation and interactions in focal adhesions by mechanical tension . The ﬁ gure illustrates how three proteins central to the assembly of the cell – matrix contact are structurally and functionally modi ﬁ ed by mechanical tension . ( 1 ) In the extracellular space , ﬁ bronectin adopts an autoinhibited globular shape until it gets in contact with other ECM proteins , or is bound by integrins . Applied mechanical stress leads to ﬁ bronectin extension and lateral polymerization into ﬁ - bronectin ﬁ bers [ 40 ] and also enables binding of growth factors to ﬁ bronectin ﬁ bers . ( 2 ) Integrin exists in a bent , inactive state until it becomes activated by intracellular ( talin binding ) and extracellular ligands [ 41 – 43 ] . Application of lateral forces appears to open the integrin legs , inducing the high - af ﬁ nity conformation , thereby reinforcing the connection to the ECM [ 44 , 45 ] . ( 3 ) Talin is released form the autoinhibited state by a combination of lipid interactions and RIAM binding , which drives talin – in - tegrin complex formation [ 30 ] . Force applied on talin , while bridging the ECM and actin – myosin cytoskeleton , opens binding sites for vinculin [ 37 ] simultaneously weakening the interaction with RIAM [ 28 ] . V . P .

In the case of the β 3 - integrin receptors α v β 3 and α IIb β 3 , three conformational states have been identi ﬁ ed . The bent , or inactive conformation exists for example in resting platelets . Integrin extension can be induced by binding of the ta - lin - head domain , suggested to act on a juxtamembrane clasp formed between the α - and β - integrin tails [ 43 ] ( Fig . 1 ) . Alter - natively , replacing Ca 2 þ with Mn 2 þ also induces this extended , ﬂ exible , but still low - af ﬁ nity conformation [ 41 ] . ECM - ligand binding to the extended , low - af ﬁ nity conformation , will lead to the conversion into the high - af ﬁ nity state by an allosteric move - ment involving the ligand - binding β - I - like domain and the con - nected hybrid domain , in a process termed hybrid - domain swing - out [ 45 ] . The hybrid - domain swing - out is allosterically linked to enhanced ligand - binding af ﬁ nity and straitening of the tensional Fig . 2 . Model of mechanoregulated recruitment of signaling proteins to focal adhesion . Talin and kindlin orchestrate the recruitment of signaling adapter proteins to the talin - bound β - integrin peptide in a tension - dependent manner ( upper panel ) . Once talin associates with the membrane proximal EFxxF of integrins , the Tyr - residue in the NPLY - motif of the integrin β - chain is no longer required for talin association and integrin clustering [ 32 ] . The tyrosine side - chain could thus be released from the talin / integrin interface , without affecting the mechanical stability of the ECM / integrin / F - actin linkage . This talin / kindlin / integrin assembly offers a suitable landing pad for paxillin ( lower panel ) , which is a key scaffolding protein , recruiting FAK , c - Src , ILK / pinch / parvin complex as well as the GIT / PIX / PAK complex , involved in regulating Rho - fa - mily and ARF - GTPases [ 50 ] . Paxillin phosphorylation regulates the association with FAK , which kinase activity is regulated by acidic lipid - binding to its N - terminal FERM domain and pTyr - dependent associationwith c - Src . The localized activation of the FAK - kinase is critical for the turnover of cell – matrix adhesions during the retraction of the cell rear , proposing in turn , tyrosine - motifs in the integrin - tail as targets for kinase - mediated feedback control ( see text for references ) .

It is therefore likely that the observed catch - bond behavior of integrins [ 46 ] is linked to the tension - mediated hybrid - domain swing - out . This elegant system would suggest that tensile forces exert allosteric effects on integrin receptors . During platelet activation , α IIb β 3 - integrin receptors switch into their ﬁ brinogen - binding mode , during a process termed in - side - out activation of integrins . Talin and kindlin recruitment to the cytoplasmic tail of integrins are crucial for this step [ 42 , 47 ] . When reconstituted in nanodiscs , the head - domain of talin in - duces a 2 - fold increase in the extension of integrins [ 43 ] , but fails to induce the open , high - af ﬁ nity conformation in the absence of ECM - ligands [ 48 ] . This in fact suggests that stable ECM / integrin / talin linkages can only be obtained if the system is put under tensile stress . Indeed , FRAP experiments have demonstrated a ra - pid integrin - exchange dynamics when integrins are activated and clustered by talins in the absence of a link to the actin cytoskele - ton . In contrast integrin dynamics is strongly reduced when the integrin is blocked in the high - af ﬁ nity hybrid - domain swing - out conformation [ 49 ] . Although some information may still be miss - ing to understand the formation and clustering of the integrin / talin / kindlin - module , it is accepted that the mechanical coupling between the ECM and the actin cytoskeleton allows the recruit - ment of signaling adapters to induce intracellular signaling . This step will be discussed in the next chapter . 5 . Tension - dependent recruitment of paxillin and the link to tyrosine kinases Paxillin , discovered over 20 years ago , and its family members have been identi ﬁ ed as signaling hubs , regulating processes such as actin - polymerization , cell proliferation , spreading and cell mi - gration [ 50 ] . Paxillin is a member of the superfamily of LIM - do - main containing proteins , which includes pinch ( from the ILK / pinch / parvin complex ) , zyxin and many other proteins . In paxillin , the C - terminal LIM - domains are responsible for recruitment to cell – matrix adhesion sites [ 51 ] ( Fig . 2 ) . Interestingly , LIM - domain containing proteins are enriched in cell – matrix adhesions in re - sponse to augmented mechanical tension [ 19 ] . Although some members of the LIM - domain family can bind Tyr - containing pep - tide motifs such as NPXY , found in the cytoplasmic tail of integrins [ 52 ] , paxillin interaction was only seen with membrane proximal integrin tail residues , but not NPXY - motifs of integrins [ 51 , 53 ] . Therefore , it is intriguing that paxillin is recruited to membrane extracted focal adhesions when put under mechanical tension [ 18 ] , proposing that paxillin LIM - domains can target tyrosine - containing peptides only , when presented in a tensioned con ﬁ g - uration ( Fig . 2 ) . So far , there is no formal proof for this hypothesis , but recent data show that tyrosine residues of the integrin tail are crucial for the ( direct or indirect ) recruitment of paxillin to cell – matrix ad - hesions [ 21 ] . Interestingly , the tyrosine residue in the membrane - proximal NPXY - motif has a double function , as it is required for talin - head domain binding in the ﬁ rst place and then also assuring the subsequent recruitment of paxillin [ 21 ] . Because paxillin - mediated signaling requires talin - mediated integrin activation , it is possible that the two proteins bind to the integrins in a se - quential manner . However , we think that this is not likely , since an increase in the af ﬁ nity ( 50 - fold ) of the integrin - peptide to the talin - head domain , does not affect the recruitment of paxillin and subsequent cell spreading . This suggests that paxillin is recruited to the NPLY - motif in a talin - bound , and mechanically tensioned state ( Fig . 2 ) . Interestingly , when the talin - head / integrin associa - tion is tested in the context of ligand - bound Mn 2 þ activated in - tegrin , the Tyr - residue in the NPLY - motif is no longer required for association and integrin clustering [ 32 ] . This suggests that the tyrosine side - chain can be released from the talin surface , without affecting the mechanical stability of the ECM / integrin / F - actin linkage , making it available for alternative binding partners , such as paxillin . In order to expose the tyrosine residue , binding of kindlin to the proximal NPXY and inter - NPXY region might be essential . Such a scenario would explain the critical signaling role of kindlin , for example seen during cell and platelet spreading [ 54 , 55 ] . As indicated above , paxillin enables the recruitment and es - tablishes multiple links to other focal adhesion adapter proteins , among them a link to vinculin , the PIK / GIT / PAK complex and to parvin [ 50 ] . The N - terminal LD - motifs are also responsible for pTyr - dependent binding to the FAT - domain of focal adhesion ki - nase [ 26 ] . 6 . Tensional sensing by tyrosine kinases FAK consists of an N - terminal FERM - domain that can interact with acidic lipids of the plasma membrane . The linker to the ki - nase domain contains the autophosphorylated Tyr - motif re - sponsible for the recruitment of c - Src . Interestingly , the C - terminal focal adhesion targeting - domain of FAK binds the N - terminal LD - motifs in paxillin . Thus the kinase domain of FAK is mechanically coupled to the membrane and the N - terminal domain of paxillin , which in turn can associate with F - actin associated proteins such as vinculin , or the ILK / pinch / parvin complex [ 50 ] . Because of this mechanical linkage , it is likely that FAK - kinase activity is in ﬂ u - enced by the mechanical tension between the N - and C - terminal domain of FAK . Interestingly , FAK has been crystallized in an au - toinhibited conformation , in which the c - Src - binding Tyr - motif is sequestered on the surface of the FERM domain [ 56 ] . In order to autophosphorylate this Tyr - motif , considerable domain - move - ments in FAK are required , which can in part be induced by the PIP2 - mediated binding of the N - terminal FERM domain to mem - branes [ 57 ] . In addition , a mechanical link to the N - terminal LD - motifs in paxillin could further accelerate the full activation of the FAK - kinase . The critical role of the FAK - kinase activity is shown in knock - in mice expressing kinase - dead FAK . FAK kinase activity is required for recruitment of c - Src via pTyr397 , as well as blood vessel formation and the turn - over of cell – matrix adhesions [ 58 ] . This demonstrates that FAK activation is an integral part of in - tegrin - dependent mechanosignaling , locally affecting cell – matrix adhesions and cell motility . Whether FAK is a bona ﬁ de mechan - oregulated kinase needs to be shown in the future . 7 . Fibronectin – contribution to mechanosignaling from ex - tracellular space As discussed above , adhesion structures are “ hot spots ” for cellular mechanosignaling . But how are cellular adhesions con - nected to the extracellular environment ? Fibronectin is an ex - tensively studied protein of the ECM , and demonstrates how ECM proteins can contribute to converting mechanical signals into chemical cues . Fibronectin consists of several globular domains and may be described as a pearl chain of FnI , FnII and FnIII repeats [ 59 ] . Ex - tracellular matrix is under mechanical tension and it has been shown that ﬁ bronectin molecules vary signi ﬁ cantly in their con - formation when cells apply force to their environment [ 60 ] . Comparison of the mechanical stability of ﬁ bronectin domains shows that they differ signi ﬁ cantly in the force required for un - folding [ 61 ] . Therefore , it is possible that the number of ( partially ) unfolded domains vary dependent on the mechanical load of the V . P . Hytönen , B .

A recent study by Kubow et al . [ 62 ] demonstrated that collagen I is preferentially co - localized with relaxed ﬁ bronectin ﬁ bers in cell culture ( Fig . 1 ) . In addition , the collagen peptide corresponding to the ﬁ bronectin - binding domain in collagen I was demonstrated to bind more ef ﬁ ciently to relaxed in vitro manufactured ﬁ bronectin ﬁ bers as compared to extended ﬁ bers . Similarly , stretching of ﬁ - bronectin has been found to control the binding of bacterial ad - hesins [ 63 ] , demonstrating that ﬁ bronectin - interaction mediated over several consecutive domains is very sensitive to the tensile forces modifying the spacing of these ﬁ bronectin domains . We have recently expressed GFP - labeled VEGF , which was found to incorporate into ECM at sites of integrin and ﬁ bronectin - containing ﬁ brillar adhesions [ 15 ] . Thus , it appears that a certain degree of ﬁ bronectin stretching is required to expose binding sites for growth factors ( Fig . 1 ) . Interestingly , ECM ﬁ bers are maintained under a certain viscoelastic stress , which can be sensed by cells and which is critical for maintaining a pool of ECM - bound growth factors . While enhanced forces are required to release TGF - β from ECM ﬁ bers , matrix - bound VEGF is released upon dissection of ECM - ﬁ bers [ 64 ] . This would consist of an elegant mechanism to release large amount of VEGF - upon injury induced released of ECM tension . 8 . Summary and outlook Mechanosensing plays a key function during the adhesive re - sponse of cells towards the extracellular matrix . In turn the ex - tracellular matrix provides an elastic scaffold to which integrin receptors are anchored . Cytoplasmic integrin adapter proteins as - sure that the ECM / integrin / F - actin connection is maintained and tuned to the speci ﬁ c contractile capacity of each cell type . Tensile forces along this mechanical link are activating a mechan - osensitive switch that can be recognized by signaling adapter proteins , such as paxillin . This creates a signaling network , con - trolling the actin cytoskeleton , as well as adhesive and motile functions of the cell . A better understanding of the mechanosensory machinery might help to develop novel molecular tools to treat and prevent diseases associated with altered mechanosignaling at cell – matrix adhesions , such as tumor growth , metastasis formation or ﬁ brosis . Tension - induced exposure of cryptic binding sites within these proteins may open targetable binding sites for peptides and small molecules to block mechanically activated signaling pathways at the level of cell – matrix adhesions .
