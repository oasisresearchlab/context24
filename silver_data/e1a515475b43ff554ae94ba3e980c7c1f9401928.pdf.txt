K IRSCH * , M ARIA - M AGDALENA G EORGESCU , S ATOSHI I SHIMARU , AND H IDESABURO H ANAFUSA † Laboratory of Molecular Oncology , The Rockefeller University , 1230 York Avenue , New York , NY 10021 Contributed by Hidesaburo Hanafusa , April 12 , 1999 ABSTRACT Cas ligand with multiple Src homology ( SH ) 3 domains ( CMS ) is an ubiquitously expressed signal trans - duction molecule that interacts with the focal adhesion protein p130 Cas . CMS contains three SH3 in its NH 2 terminus and proline - rich sequences in its center region . The latter se - quences mediate the binding to the SH3 domains of p130 Cas , Src - family kinases , p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3 - ki - nase , and Grb2 . The COOH - terminal region contains putative actin binding sites and a coiled - coil domain that mediates homodimerization of CMS . CMS is a cytoplasmic protein that colocalizes with F - actin and p130 Cas to membrane ruffles and leading edges of cells . Ectopic expression of CMS in COS - 7 cells resulted in alteration in arrangement of the actin cy - toskeleton . We observed a diffuse distribution of actin in small dots and less actin fiber formation . Altogether , these features suggest that CMS functions as a scaffolding molecule with a specialized role in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton . Tumor cells are characterized by their acquired capacity of uncontrolled proliferation and an increased ability to migrate and invade healthy tissue . Transformation of normal mamma - lian cells into an invasive tumor results in alterations of cell matrix responses by integrins and loss of polarity ( reviewed in refs . 1 and 2 ) . Most integrins are transmembrane linkers , which mediate the interaction between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix . Their activation leads to the assembly of signaling complexes , known as focal adhesions and focal contacts , and subsequently to the activation of intracellular signaling cascades ( 3 , 4 ) . p130 Cas , a docking protein that is tyrosine - phosphorylated in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli , such as growth factors , cell – cell interaction , and cell – matrix interaction , ap - pears to play a critical role in the integrin - linked formation of focal complexes ( 5 – 8 ) . In p130 Cas - deficient mice , a prominent feature is heart failure caused by the disruption of the Z discs in cardiomyocytes ( 9 ) . Z discs are structures similar to focal adhesions , and their role is to organize the actin cytoskeleton ( 10 ) . Moreover , recent work has indicated a role for phos - phorylated p130 Cas in cell migration ( 11 ) . p130 Cas is composed of an NH 2 - terminal Src homology ( SH ) 3 domain and regions with SH3 and SH2 - binding motifs . It initially was identified as highly phosphorylated protein in v - src and v - crk transformed fibroblasts ( 12 – 14 ) , and a role in transformation has been suggested ( 15 ) . In these cells , the constitutive phosphorylation of p130 Cas results in the perma - nent recruitment of SH2 containing signaling proteins into focal complexes ( 16 , 17 ) . The consequence is the constitutive propagation of downstream signals , resulting in changes in the cytoskeleton , induction of migration , and enhanced invasive potential of carcinoma cells ( 11 , 18 ) . Indeed , by using p130 Cas ( 2 y 2 ) mouse embryonic fibroblasts , Honda et al . ( 9 ) demon - strated that expression of activated Src did not induce a fully transformed phenotype . To understand the growth regulatory pathway of p130 Cas we used the yeast - two hybrid system in search for interacting molecules ( 19 ) . We identified CMS ( p130Cas ligand with multiple SH3 domains ) as a direct binding protein of p130 Cas . CMS is a multifunctional adapter type molecule , which is localized to the cytoplasm , membrane ruffles , and leading edges of cells . Its structure and the colocalization with F - actin and p130 Cas suggests a function as scaffolding protein involved in the dynamic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells and Reagents . Human 293T kidney epithelial ( 293T ) cells and COS - 7 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10 % FCS . mAbs and antisera used were : anti - glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) , Santa Cruz Biotechnology : anti - flag ( M2 ) , Sigma ; anti - p130 Cas , anti - focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , and anti - Csk , Transduction Laboratories , Lexington , KY ; anti - phosphotyrosine ( 4G10 ) and anti - Fyn , Upstate Biotechnol - ogy ; anti - Abl , PharMingen ; anti - Src ( 327 ) , a gift from J .

Flag - tagged constructs were : full - length CMS , CMS y TH ( TH , two - hybrid clone ; encoding the cDNA fragment isolated in the yeast two - hybrid screen ) , and CMS y 3SH3 ( containing only the three SH3 domains ) were generated by PCR and cloned in - frame into the pFLAG - CMV - 2 vector . A truncated CMS construct , GST - CMS y P - CC , ( lacking all three SH3 domains ) , was generated by standard PCR and cloned into the pEBG vector containing a GST tag . GST fusion protein constructs for the three SH3 domains of CMS were constructed as follows : The Eco RI DNA fragment encoding the first SH3 domain [ CMS - SH3 ( 1 ) ] was cloned in - frame into the pGEX - 4T - 3 vector . The cDNA fragments encoding the second SH3 domain [ CMS - SH3 ( 2 ) ] and the third SH3 domain [ CMS - SH3 ( 3 ) ] of CMS were generated by stan - dard PCR . The amplification products were cloned into the pGEX - 2TK vector . The GST fusion protein construct for the SH3 domains of p130 Cas has been described ( 19 ) . The CMS deletion constructs DL1 , DL2 , and DL3 were cloned into pACT2 ( CLONTECH ) , and CMS y P - CC was cloned into pAS2 – 1 ( CLONTECH ) . All PCR products and all junctions were verified by DNA sequencing . Analysis of RNA Expression . A Multi - Tissue Northern Blot and a Human RNA Master Blot ( CLONTECH ) were hybrid - ized with a 32 P - labeled cDNA probe of 1 . 1 kbp corresponding to the CMS clone isolated in the yeast two - hybrid screen ( shown in Fig . 1 ) under high stringency conditions . The labeling method of the probe and the hybridization conditions were the same as described above . The blots were reprobed with b - actin . Transfection , Western Blotting ( WB ) , in Vitro Binding As - say , and Far WB . 293T cells were transiently transfected with 3 m g of cDNA per 60 - mm dish or 6 m g cDNA per 100 - mm dish by using the modified calcium phosphate transfection system ( Stratagene ) . Thirty - six hours after transfection , the cells were washed once with cold PBS and lysed with lysis buffer . One milligram of total protein was used for protein association experiments . Cell lysis , immunoprecipitation , and WB was performed as described ( 19 ) . Expression and affinity purifi - cation of GST - fusion peptides , in vitro binding assays , and Far WB were carried out as described ( 19 ) . Kinase Assay . CMS was immunoprecipitated with anti - flag mAb , and precipitates were washed three times . The kinase reaction was performed for 30 min at 30°C in 30 m l of kinase buffer ( 30 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 y 10 mM MgCl 2 y 1 mM DTT y 25 mM ATP ) containing 10 m Ci of [ g - 32 P ] ATP . The reaction was terminated by adding 5 m l of sample buffer and boiled for 5 min , and the samples were separated by SDS y PAGE . Proteins were transferred onto Immobilon - P transfer membrane and exposed to autoradiography films ( Kodak ) . Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Microscopy Analysis on Transiently Transfected Cells . COS - 7 cells ( 3 3 10 3 ) were plated on poly - D - lysine - coated coverslips ( Biocoat Cellware , Becton Dickinson ) overnight and transfected with 1 m g plas - mid . If indicated , 24 h after transfection , the cells were serum - starved for 14 – 18 h . Cells plated on poly - D - lysine - coated coverslips were either left untreated or treated with 10 nM phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate for 10 min . Cells were fixed with 3 % formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min and permea - belized with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 5 min , and unspecific binding sites were blocked with 50 mM glycine in PBS for 10 min . Cells were stained with the mAb M2 ( 3 m g y ml ) for CMS or with anti - p130 Cas antibody ( 1 : 200 dilution ) . After four washes , cells were incubated with a mix of FITC - conjugated donkey anti - mouse IgG ( 1 : 300 dilution ) and rho - damine - labeled phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) ( 1 : 300 dilution ) for visualizing actin filaments . Cells were inspected by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a Zeiss Axioplan2 instrument . RESULTS CMS Is a Protein Containing Domains Common to Adapt - er - Type Molecules . A partial cDNA clone of CMS was isolated from a human placenta library in a yeast two - hybrid screen by using the SH3 domain of p130 Cas as bait . Additional overlap - ping clones were isolated by 5 9 rapid amplification of comple - mentary DNA ends by using human placenta RNA as template or by Southern hybridization of a human kidney cDNA library cloned in l gt11 . Conceptional translation revealed a protein of 639 aa with a deduced molecular mass of approximately 70 kDa ( Fig . 1 ) . The analysis of the amino acid sequence revealed that CMS contains in its NH 2 terminus three SH3 domains followed by a proline - rich region containing binding sites for SH3 domains . Putative actin binding sites and a coiled - coil ( CC ) domain are located at the COOH terminus of the protein , which also contains a putative leucine zipper motif . The COILS program ( 20 ) was used to predict the probability of a CC structure in CMS . Besides the described domains , the amino acid sequence shows no significant homology to other proteins listed in the available databases ( data not shown ) , therefore all structural features indicate that CMS is a unique adapter - type molecule . CMS and p130 Cas Interact in Vitro and in Vivo . To confirm the interaction of p130 Cas with the TH clone of CMS , we analyzed its in vivo binding in mammalian cells by transiently coexpressing CMS and p130 Cas in 293T cells . When we co - F IG . 1 . Schematic representation of the human CMS and protein sequence .

( C ) In vitro interaction of p130 Cas and CMS . 293T cells were transiently transfected with the flag - tagged CMS yeast TH clone ( CMS - TH ) together with the CasSH3 domain or full - length Cas ( both GST tagged ) or the vector alone ( GST control ) . Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti - flag antibody or glutathione Sepharose beads , and precipitates were subjected to SDS y PAGE and probed with anti - GST antibody and anti - flag antibody , respectively . The upper blot was striped and reprobed with anti - flag antibody . ( D ) Direct interaction of CMS with p130 Cas . Five hundred micrograms of protein from 293T cells express - ing the various CMS peptides or C3G used as a positive control was immunoprecipitated with the antibodies indicated above . Blots were probed for binding with 32 P - labeled GST - p130 Cas SH3 domain . 6212 Cell Biology : Kirsch et al . Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 96 ( 1999 ) transfected the flag - tagged CMS y TH clone together with the GST - tagged SH3 domain of p130 Cas or the full - length p130 Cas , we were able to detect CMS in anti - GST immunoprecipitates of the p130 Cas proteins ( Fig . 1 C ) . Conversely , we also could detect the SH3 domain of p130 Cas and p130 Cas full - length ( after longer exposure ) in anti - flag immunoprecipitates ( Fig . 1 C ) , indicating that the interaction of p130 Cas and CMS takes place in mammalian cells in vivo . To determine whether the interaction of CMS and p130 Cas was direct or mediated by other proteins , a Far WB analysis was carried out by using the 32 P - labeled GST - p130 Cas SH3 domain as probe . As shown in Fig . 1 D , the p130 Cas SH3 domain bound specifically to over - expressed flag - tagged CMS and CMS y TH , respectively as confirmed by probing with anti - flag antibody ( not shown ) . The direct interaction of the p130 Cas SH3 domain with C3G was found previously ( 19 ) and used as positive control in this experiment . CMS mRNA Is Ubiquitously Expressed in Adult and Fetal Human Tissues . To assess the expression profile of CMS mRNA , we analyzed various adult and fetal human tissues by Northern blotting ( Fig . 2 ) . We detected a prominent transcript of ’ 5 . 4 kb in all tissues examined . The CMS transcript is widely expressed in fetal and adult human tissues . In most of the cases there was no clear tissue - specific difference in expression levels . However , we noticed slightly higher expression levels ( 2 - fold ) in the placenta ( F4 ) , colon ( C4 ) , kidney ( E1 ) , pancreas ( D1 ) , and thymus ( E5 ) . In contrast , lower expression levels ( 50 % reduction ) were observed in the aorta ( C2 ) , skeletal muscle ( C3 ) , bladder ( C5 ) , and uterus ( C6 ) with respect to their b - actin levels ( not shown ) ( Fig . 2 B ) . CMS Induces Vesicle Formation and Colocalizes with p130 Cas and F - Actin to Membrane Ruffles . Immunofluores - cence staining and confocal microscopy of CMS - expressing cells were performed to analyze CMS’s intracellular localiza - tion and distribution . Because of the lack of a specific anti - CMS antibody , we examined the localization of flag - tagged CMS constructs transiently expressed in COS - 7 cells . In ran - domly growing cells , CMS is localized in the cytoplasm and to the leading edges of these cells ( Fig . 3 ) . We observed this expression pattern also in resting , serum - starved cells and CMS - expressing cells plated on fibronectin - coated slides ( data not shown ) . Interestingly , more than 80 % of the CMS cells contained vesicles in various numbers and sizes , and the distribution of CMS in the cytoplasm was concentrated in small dots ( Fig . 3 B ) . CMS was found to be localized to the surface of these vesicle . In contrast , cells that expressed truncated forms of CMS consisting exclusively of the three SH3 domains ( CMS y 3SH3 ) or consisting of the CMS - TH fragment ( lacking the first 279 aa ) did not induce vesicle formation . Moreover , both truncated peptides were more diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm . These results suggested that the staining pattern in cells expressing full - length CMS was specific and that both the NH 2 and COOH terminus are necessary for the vesicle formation and sublocalization of CMS . In addition , we noticed less actin fiber formation in randomly growing CMS - expressing cells . The staining of F - actin in CMS expressing cells appeared to be brighter com - pared with untransfected cells , and in transfected cells the actin was concentrated in small dots similarly to the staining pattern observed for CMS . Frequently , actin clustering adja - cent to the nucleus also could be observed in CMS cells . CMS and p130 Cas colocalize in Cos - 7 cells expressing both molecules ( not shown ) . To investigate whether CMS can translocate to membrane ruffles , serum - starved cells express - ing full - length CMS or p130 Cas were treated overnight with phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) . After PMA treat - ment , cells showed prominent membrane ruffles that con - tained both CMS and p130 Cas ( Fig . 3 C and D ) . Taken together , these findings demonstrated that both CMS and p130 Cas colocalize with actin in membrane ruffles and leading edges of cells . CMS Associates and Is Phosphorylated by Tyrosine Ki - nases . To further investigate the signaling potential of CMS , we analyzed the ability of selected SH3 - containing proteins to bind to the COOH - terminal region of CMS , which includes the proline - rich region indicated in Fig . 1 . This in vitro binding study clearly demonstrated that besides the SH3 domain of p130 Cas , the SH3 domains of the tyrosine kinases Fyn , Src , and Yes , the SH3 domain of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylino - sitol 3 - kinase , and the NH 2 - terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 bound to the adapter protein CMS . On the other hand , CMS proline - rich sequences did not bind to the SH3 domains of c - Abl , Crk , and the three SH3 domains of CMS ( Fig . 4 A ) . We also confirmed the binding of endogenous Fyn and Yes to the CMS - TH clone when it was overexpressed in 293T cells ( Fig . 4 B ) . Based on this observation , we were interested in analyzing whether CMS is associated with endogenous kinase activity . A kinase assay performed on CMS immunoprecipitates resulted in a phosphorylated band of ’ 80 kDa corresponding to the size of the flag - tagged CMS ( Fig . 4 C ) . To investigate whether CMS can serve as a substrate for tyrosine kinases , the tyrosine phosphorylation of CMS transiently coexpressed with c - Abl , FAK , Fyn , c - Src , Yes , or Csk was analyzed . As shown in Fig . 4 D , CMS could be detected in anti - phosphotyrosine precipi - tates of CMS lysates of cells coexpressing c - Abl , Fyn , or c - Src . Conversely , tyrosine phosphorylation of CMS also could be seen in anti - flag immunoprecipitates corresponding to over - expressed CMS ( data not shown ) . However , no tyrosine phosphorylation of CMS was observed in cells coexpressing FAK , Csk , or Yes . Homodimerization of CMS via Its Putative Leucine Zipper Motif . As described above , the structural analysis of CMS revealed a CC domain in its COOH terminus containing a putative leucine zipper motif as shown by the helical wheel analysis in Fig . 5 A .

Cell Biology : Kirsch et al . Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 96 ( 1999 ) 6213 using the SSP program ( 21 ) suggested that the region from Glu - 607 to Ala - 635 should be helical . Leucine zipper motifs have been implicated in homotypic and heterotypic protein – protein interactions . To evaluate the potential of the CMS COOH terminus to homodimerize , we tested whether trun - cated forms of CMS differently tagged interact in vivo . A GST - tagged construct , consisting only of the COOH terminal half of CMS ( lacking all three SH3 domains , GST - CMS y P - CC ) , was coexpressed with the flag - tagged CMS - TH construct in 293T cells . The peptides were tested for complex formation in a GST pull - down assay . As shown in Fig . 5 B ( lane 4 ) , the flag - tagged peptide coprecipitated with GST - CMS y P - CC and not with GST alone ( lane 3 ) . To further analyze the sequence requirements for CMS homodimerization , we assayed various CMS deletion con - structs for their ability to interact in a yeast two - hybrid assay . The CMS deletion constructs ( DL1 , DL2 , and DL3 ) were cloned into the yeast expression vector pACT2 , expressed as GAL4 activation domain fusion peptide , and tested for binding the CMS y P - CC peptide expressed as GAL4 DNA - binding domain fusion peptides ( Fig . 5 C ) . We found homotypic inter - action between the CMS y P - CC constructs and DL1 and DL2 . In contrast , the construct DL3 that lacked the COOH terminus that contains the CC domain failed to interact with the CMS y P - CC construct . These results indicated that indeed CMS has the ability to homodimerize and for that it uses the CC domain in its COOH terminus . In contrast , we did not detect intramolecular or intermolecular binding via the SH3 domains and PXXP binding . DISCUSSION p130 Cas , a family member of structurally related docking molecules ( 22 – 24 ) , is expressed in a broad variety of tissues . By using the yeast two - hybrid system , we have identified a mol - ecule , CMS , as potential p130 Cas interacting protein . By using in vitro and in vivo studies , we clearly showed that p130 Cas and CMS interact via binding between the SH3 domain of p130 Cas and PXXP motifs of CMS , and that this interaction is direct . It has been shown that amino acids immediately adjacent to the proline residues are important for specificity ( 25 , 26 ) . Re - cently , we identified the PpK y RPp motif as consensus binding sequence for the SH3 domain of p130 Cas ( 19 ) . Located in the center part of CMS is a proline - rich region containing five core PXKP motifs that could serve as binding sites for the SH3 domain of p130 Cas . Human CMS is composed of 639 aa , and similarly to p130 Cas , is ubiquitously expressed . In transiently transfected epithelial cells , we have demonstrated that CMS resides in the cytoplasm and accumulates in membrane ruffles and leading edges of migratory cells , where it colocalizes with F - actin . Furthermore , the most prominent phenotype observed in CMS - expressing cells was the accumulation of multiple large vesicles in the cytoplasm of CMS - expressing COS - 7 cells . Interestingly , we found that both the NH 2 - teminal and the COOH - terminal region of CMS are necessary for the formation of vesicles and its dot - like distribution in the cytoplasm . This finding suggests that CMS acts as an adapter protein that forms larger com - plexes with other proteins . Indeed , CMS contains many po - tential protein binding sites , the most notable being the three F IG . 3 . CMS is localized in the cytoplasm and colocalizes with actin and p130 Cas to membrane ruffles . ( A and B ) COS - 7 cells grown in medium containing 10 % FBS , plated on poly - D - lysine coverslips , were transfected with the flag - tagged CMS constructs CMS , CMS y TH , and CMS y 3SH3 as indicated .

Yellow - orange color in merged image shows colocalization of CMS and p130 Cas with actin ( lane 2 , marked with arrows ) . ( Bar , 20 m m . ) 6214 Cell Biology : Kirsch et al . Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 96 ( 1999 ) adjacent SH3 domains in its NH 2 terminus . Remarkably , all SH3 domains are most related to each other , to various myosins ( especially the unconventional myosin 1B ) ( 27 ) , to the newly identified Rac target POSH ( 28 ) , and to PIX , a p65 PAK - interacting exchange factor ( 29 ) . Interestingly , these are pro - teins that are structural or signaling components of the cy - toskeleton . Among the SH3 domains of CMS , the highest identity ( 48 . 2 % ) was observed between the second and the third SH3 domain , suggesting that they may bind to the same or related ligands . While this report was in preparation , the mouse homologue of CMS , 86 % identical and named CD2AP , has been reported as a protein that binds to the cytoplasmic tail of the adhesion molecule CD2 ( 30 ) . The authors have shown that the interaction of the NH 2 - terminal SH3 domain with CD2 is necessary for CD2 clustering and cytoskeletal polar - ization of T cells . Because the expression of CMS is not restricted to immune cells , it is likely that CMS has different binding partners in other tissues . In addition , we showed that CMS contains a functional leucine zipper that can mediate its homodimerization . It is also possible that the leucine zipper of CMS binds to other proteins with higher affinity and thus contributes to the assembly of larger protein complexes as described for HEF , a p130 Cas family member ( 23 ) . Another indication that CMS can interact with a number of different proteins simultaneously is given by the consensus binding sites for SH3 domains located in its center region . We could show that , besides p130 Cas , proteins with different functions , Src - family protein tyrosine kinases , the p85 subunit of the phos - phatidylinositol 3 - kinase , and the Grb2 adapter protein , bind to these sites . The finding that p130 Cas and CMS interact in vivo and their overlapping intracellular localization suggests that both mol - ecules act in concert . Notably , in our experiments , p130 Cas overexpression led to the accumulation of vesicles similarly to CMS ( not shown ) . It has been shown that p130 Cas contributes to the dynamic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton , inducing membrane ruffling , and positively regulating cell migration , which depends on the small G protein Rac ( 11 ) . Cytoskeletal rearrangements and membrane ruffling have been linked to the activation state of Rac ( 31 ) . In confluent cells activated Rac induced actin reorganization at the plasma membrane to form membrane ruffles , whereas in subconfluent cells it mostly induced the accumulation of large vesicles ( 31 ) . The accumulation of large vesicles that we observed in CMS - expressing cells suggests that CMS could be a component of Rac signaling pathways . The structure of CMS formed by proline - rich sequences that bind a large array of proteins and the presence of three SH3 domains suggest a function for CMS as scaffolding protein . Also , CMS contains at least four putative actin binding sites similar to the LKKTET motifs found in a number of actin binding proteins , including a - actinin , tropomyosin , villin , de - matin , and actobindin ( 32 ) , and in the small actin - sequestering protein thymosin b 4 ( 33 ) . Comparably , the yeast protein F IG . 4 . Analysis of SH3 - containing proteins for their interaction with CMS .

Three single colonies were analyzed for interaction in a b - galactosidose filter assay ( 19 ) . 2 , no interaction . 1 , interaction . Cell Biology : Kirsch et al . Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 96 ( 1999 ) 6215 Bem1p , which contains two SH3 domains , appears to coordi - nate rearrangements of the cytoskeleton during cell polariza - tion in response to mating factor and vegetative growth . It binds to Cdc24 , a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Cdc42 , a close family member of Rac ( 34 ) . Bem1p also has been shown to interact directly with Ste20 , the yeast homo - logue of the serine y threonine kinase p65 PAK as well as with actin , and it is thought to link membrane proteins to the cytoskeleton ( 35 ) . Several lines of evidence suggest that tyrosine phosphory - lation is important in Rac signaling . Growth factors , such as platelet - derived growth factor , epidermal growth factor , and insulin , not only activate their receptor tyrosine kinases , they also rapidly induce Rac - dependent membrane ruffling and the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130 Cas ( 5 , 31 , 36 ) . It has been shown that Src - family kinases are responsible for the phosho - rylation of proteins involved in the dynamic regulation of the cytoskeleton , including paxillin , vinculin , talin , and cortactin ( 37 – 40 ) . Furthermore , the activation of c - Abl in response to integrin stimulation also has been demonstrated ( 41 ) . Inter - estingly , we have demonstrated that CMS is a putative sub - strate for the tyrosine kinases Src , Fyn , and c - Abl . However , the physiological conditions under which CMS becomes ty - rosine - phosphorylated have yet to be defined . We failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of CMS by treatment of 293T cells with epidermal growth factor or cell spreading on fi - bronectin , but we observed a moderate increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of CMS after 15 - min treatment with cytocha - lasin D at concentrations that disrupt the cortical actin cy - toskeleton ( unpublished results ) . In summary , we have identified CMS as a p130 Cas binding molecule that may regulate the temporal and spatial assembly of larger signaling complexes and link membrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton .
