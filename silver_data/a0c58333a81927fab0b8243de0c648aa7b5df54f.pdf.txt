It is often resistant to glucocorticoid therapy and progresses to end - stage renal disease in 50 to 70 % of patients . Genetic studies have shown that familial focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is a disease of the podocytes , which are major components of the glomerular filtration barrier . However , the molecular cause in over half the cases of primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is unknown , and effec - tive treatments have been elusive . Methods We performed whole - genome linkage analysis followed by high - throughput sequenc - ing of the positive - linkage area in a family with autosomal recessive focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( index family ) and sequenced a newly discovered gene in 52 unre - lated patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis . Immunohistochemical studies were performed on human kidney - biopsy specimens and cultured podocytes . Expres - sion studies in vitro were performed to characterize the functional consequences of the mutations identified . Results We identified two mutations ( A159P and Y695X ) in MYO1E , which encodes a non - muscle class I myosin , myosin 1E ( Myo1E ) . The mutations in MYO1E segregated with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in two independent pedigrees ( the index family and Family 2 ) . Patients were homozygous for the mutations and did not have a re - sponse to glucocorticoid therapy . Electron microscopy showed thickening and dis - organization of the glomerular basement membrane . Normal expression of Myo1E was documented in control human kidney - biopsy specimens in vivo and in glomeru - lar podocytes in vitro . Transfection studies revealed abnormal subcellular localiza - tion and function of the A159P - Myo1E mutant . The Y695X mutation causes loss of calmodulin binding and of the tail domains of Myo1E . Conclusions MYO1E mutations are associated with childhood - onset , glucocorticoid - resistant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis . Our data provide evidence of a role of Myo1E in podo - cyte function and the consequent integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier .

As the disease progresses , the pattern of glomerulosclerosis be - comes predominantly global . Alterations of the podocytes , resulting in foot - process effacement , constitute the major ultrastructural abnormality . The pathological classification of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis includes collapsing , tip - lesion , cellular , and perihilar variants , as well as a type known as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis not otherwise specified . 1 Although focal segmental glomerulosclerosis may be a primary disorder , sec - ondary cases have been associated with drug toxic - ity , viral infections , and diseases that affect the renal mass and glomerular hemodynamics . 2 Ge - netic forms of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis have been reported , some of which affect the kid - ney exclusively , whereas others are syndromic , with multiorgan involvement . 3 - 5 The genetic forms are usually glucocorticoid - resistant and often progress to end - stage renal disease . 4 Patients with focal segmental glomerulosclero - sis generally present with proteinuria , with urine protein levels often in the nephrotic range , owing to dysfunction of the glomerular filtration barri - er . 6 The disorder accounts for 7 to 20 % of cases of the nephrotic syndrome in children 7 and up to 35 % of cases in adults , 8 , 9 and its incidence appears to be increasing . 7 , 10 An understanding of the glo - merular filtration barrier is key to discussions of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis . This barrier is tripartite , consisting of a fenestrated endothelium , the glomerular basement membrane , and podo - cytes , which are differentiated epithelial cells with interdigitated foot processes interconnected by multiprotein slit diaphragms . 6 Genetic studies in familial forms of focal seg - mental glomerulosclerosis indicate that the dis - order is associated with mutations in genes that encode several podocyte proteins . 11 - 18 However , the molecular cause is unknown in more than 50 % of patients with primary , glucocorticoid - resistant fo - cal segmental glomerulosclerosis , and effective treatments are lacking . 3 We performed whole - genome linkage analysis and high - throughput sequencing in a family with autosomal recessive focal segmental glomerulo - sclerosis and identified a missense mutation in MYO1E , which encodes myosin 1E ( Myo1E ) , a non - muscle class I myosin . Wild - type Myo1E is ex - pressed mainly at the plasma membrane , but mu - tant Myo1E localizes to the podocyte cytoplasm . We also sequenced MYO1E in a different group of patients and identified another mutation that causes protein truncation and leads to focal seg - mental glomerulosclerosis . Together , these find - ings define the important role of Myo1E in main - taining the function of the glomerular filtration barrier in humans . Methods Study Participants The index family was from Italy and included con - sanguineous , unaffected parents and their three children who had the nephrotic syndrome and lesions typical of focal segmental glomeruloscle - rosis on kidney biopsy ( Fig . 1 ) . We also recruited unrelated patients who had either familial reces - sive focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( 28 pa - tients , including a patient from a family in Turkey [ Family 2 ] ) , or sporadic , childhood - onset focal seg - mental glomerulosclerosis ( 24 patients younger than 13 years of age ) . Since mutations in the same gene may associate with either focal segmental glomerulosclerosis or diffuse mesangial sclero - sis , 16 we included 38 children with the latter dis - order ( 5 with the familial form and 33 with the sporadic form ) . None of the patients carried mu - tations in NPHS1 , NPHS2 , or WT1 . DNA samples from 484 healthy white persons ( 382 Italian and 102 Turkish ) were included as controls . Study Design and Assessments The study was begun on October 1 , 2007 , and end - ed on March 31 , 2011 . Whole - genome linkage anal - ysis was performed in the index family with the use of an array of 1 million single - nucleotide polymor - phisms ( SNPs ) . A customized - sequence capture ar - ray was used to isolate genomic DNA of the posi - tive - linkage region , which was sequenced on a 454 Genome Sequencer FLX platform ( 454 Life Scienc - es ) . Localization of Myo1E in kidney specimens from controls and patients and in cultured podo - cytes , as well as its colocalization with other podo - cyte proteins , was assessed by means of immuno - fluorescence and immunoperoxidase staining and by means of immunogold electron microscopy . Wild - type and mutant recombinant Myo1E pro - teins were expressed in cultured podocytes , and their intracellular localization and effects on cy - toskeletal and other podocyte proteins and on podocyte motility were evaluated .

Thirty percent of the glomeruli had segmental sclerohyalinosis with capsular crescents and floc - culocapsular adhesion , and 30 % had global sclero - hyalinosis and collapse . The remaining glomeru - li had focal mesangial hyperplasia , as well as tubular atrophy with tubulitis and moderate inter - stitial inflammatory infiltrates . Diffuse glomeru - lar parietal deposits of IgM , C3 , C4 , and C1q and peritubular deposits of IgA , IgG , and C3 were present . Electron microscopy was not performed . The patient was treated with prednisone , cyclo - sporine , and an angiotensin - converting – enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor , with no reduction in urine protein levels . After 1 year of therapy , prednisone and cy - closporine were discontinued . Renal function progressively deteriorated , and end - stage renal disease developed when she was 13 years of age . At the age of 17 years , she received a cadaveric kidney transplant . One year after transplantation , graft function was normal , with no proteinuria . After focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was diagnosed in the proband , her two siblings ( Pa - tients 2 and 3 ) were found to have proteinuria and milder renal injury , with 10 to 30 % of glomeruli affected by segmental or diffuse sclerohyalinosis with segmental flocculocapsular adhesion and mes an gi al hyperplasia . Parietal and mesangial focal deposition of IgM , C3 , and C1q and peritu - bular staining for IgG , C3 , and C4 were noted in biopsy specimens from both siblings . The histo - logic findings for all three siblings are compatible with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis not oth - erwise specified . 1 Although the proband did not have a response to treatment with glucocorticoids and cyclosporine , in both her siblings , cyclospo - rine therapy reduced proteinuria but did not elimi - nate it ( Table 1 ) . Family 2 The proband in Family 2 ( Patient 4 ) presented with edema , nephrotic - range proteinuria , hematuria , and hypoalbuminemia at 1 year of age ( Table 1 and Fig . 1B ) . When she was 4 years of age , renal biopsy showed segmental or global sclerosis of T a b l e 1 .

MYO1E Mutations in Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis 10 . 1056 / nejm oa 1101273 nejm . org 5 20 % of glomeruli ( Fig . 2 in the Supplementary Appendix ) and focal tubular dilatation and atro - phy with interstitial fibrosis . Focal glomerular IgG , IgA , and C3 staining was noted . All these features are compatible with focal segmental glomerulo - sclerosis not otherwise specified . Staining with the use of two antibodies against the C - terminal of Myo1E was negative for Myo1E ; glomerular syn - aptopodin staining was greatly reduced , whereas podocin staining was almost normal ( Fig . 3 in the Supplementary Appendix ) . Electron - microscopical examination showed foot - process effacement and microvillous transformation of podocytes , focal thickening and disorganization of the glomerular basement membrane with loss of identifiable layers ( Fig . 1C and 1E ) , and focal expansion of the me - sangial matrix . These changes are almost identical to those seen in Myo1e - deficient mice 19 ( Fig . 1D and 1F , and Fig . 4 in the Supplementary Appendix ) . Other abnormalities included multilamination in the basement membrane of Bowman’s capsule , fo - cal mes angial interposition in the glomerular base - ment membrane , and electron - dense areas in the mesangium . From 1 . 5 to 13 years of age , the patient received glucocorticoid therapy alone or in combination with cyclosporine . Proteinuria reached a nadir with cyclosporine ( Fig . 5 in the Supplementary Appen - dix ) , but complete remission was not achieved . She is currently taking ramipril and losartan and has mild edema , proteinuria ( Table 1 ) , and micro - hematuria . Renal function and blood pressure are normal . Her older sister had presented with microhema - turia and mild proteinuria at 3 months of age . Renal biopsy showed segmental glomerular hya - linization and thickening of the glomerular base - ment membrane associated with mesangial prolif - eration . Immunofluorescence studies and electron microscopy were not carried out . She received glucocorticoid therapy ( without cyclosporine or ACE inhibitors ) . Renal function progressively de - teriorated to end - stage renal disease , and she died at 6 years of age . No relevant extrarenal manifes - tations were reported in affected members of ei - ther the index family or Family 2 , which would rule out a syndromic form of focal segmental glomeru - losclerosis with multiorgan involvement . Genetic and Functional Studies Whole - genome multipoint linkage analysis of the three siblings and the father in the index family showed a single positive peak on chromosome 15q21 ( logarithm of the odds [ LOD ] score max = 1 . 9 ; z score max = 2 . 7 ) ( Fig . 2A ) . We also genotyped the mother for nine rare SNPs in the linkage peak , with rs7181069 reaching the highest LOD score , at 2 . 7 ( z score max = 7 . 4 ) , and defined a new puta - tive locus for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis . The linkage area spanned 16 megabases between rs12900916 and rs2278545 . The expected length of the identity - by - descent ( IBD ) region around the disease locus is a function of sibling inbreeding ( inbreeding coefficient F = 0 . 00195 ) , predicting an IBD region of about 16 centimorgans . 20 The 112 genes in this region were screened by means of genomic locus capture followed by high - throughput sequencing in the proband . There were 2141 homozygous mismatches , of which 3 were putative functional variants not reported in SNP databases ( 2 splice variants and 1 nonsynonymous change ) . Only the coding variant was predicted to be damaging on the basis of bioinformatic analy - sis ( Table 3 in the Supplementary Appendix ) . There is a G→C change in exon 6 of MYO1E ( c . 475G→C ) replacing alanine - 159 of Myo1E with proline ( p . A159P ) . Direct sequencing showed that the three affected siblings were homozygous for the mutation and the unaffected parents were hetero - zygous for the mutation , confirming that the mu - tation segregates with focal segmental glomerulo - sclerosis ( Fig . 2B ) . The mutation was not found in 764 normal chromosomes from Italian subjects . Myo1E is a membrane - associated class I myo - sin with a motor - head domain that binds ATP and F - actin , a calmodulin - binding neck domain and a tail domain ( Fig . 2C ) . 21 - 23 The amino acid A159 is highly conserved in myosins from protozoa to humans and lies in the switch - 1 loop of the motor - head domain ( Fig . 2C and 2D ) . 24 Our structural tridimensional model shows that the switch - 1 region is located in the ATP - binding pocket close to the actin - binding domain ( Fig . 6 in the Supple - mentary Appendix ) . MYO1E was sequenced in the other patients , and a homozygous nonsense mutation ( c . 2085T→G ) was identified in a girl in a second family ( Fam - ily 2 ) , who had familial focal segmental glomeru - losclerosis ( Patient 4 ) . This mutation causes pro - tein interruption at tyrosine 695 ( p . Y695X ) , at the start of the calmodulin - binding domain ( Fig . 2B and 2C , and Fig . 6 in the Supplementary Appen - dix ) . Her parents and her unaffected brother were heterozygous for this mutation ( Fig . 1B ) , which The New England Journal of Medicine Downloaded from nejm . org at SBBL on July 25 , 2011 .

Myo1E expression in human podocytes was con - firmed by Western blot analysis ( Fig . 8 in the Supplementary Appendix ) . In cultured human podocytes , Myo1E localized close to the cytoplas - mic membrane , with enrichment at the lamellipo - dia tips ( Fig . 3D , 3E , and 3F ) . In costaining ex - periments , Myo1E localized at the tips of F - actin bundles ( Fig . 3D , 3E , and 3F ) and partially colocal - ized with CD2 - associated protein ( CD2AP ) ( Fig . 3G ) . Immunogold labeling for Myo1E in control human glomeruli revealed gold particles almost exclusively on the cytoplasmic side of the podo - cyte plasma membrane ( Fig . 3H and 3I ) . Human podocytes transfected with green fluo - rescent protein ( GFP ) – tagged wild - type Myo1E or E753K , I531M , D465N , and F307L ( control SNPs ) showed predominant localization at the plasma membrane , whereas podocytes transfected with GFP - tagged mutant A159P Myo1E showed diffuse cytoplasmic localization , which at a higher plas - mid dose acquired a punctate pattern ( Fig . 4A through 4F , and Fig . 9 and 10 in the Supplemen - tary Appendix ) . Similar findings were observed in mouse podo - cytes and HEK293 cells ( Fig . 11 and 12 in the Supplementary Appendix ) . A Western blot analy - sis of wild - type and mutant A159P Myo1E expres - sion in human and mouse podocytes is shown in Figure 13 in the Supplementary Appendix . Total - internal - reflection fluorescence microscopy of live mouse podocytes showed enhanced green fluo - rescent protein ( EGFP ) – tagged wild - type Myo1E in a bright , discrete , punctate pattern on lamel - lipodia and filopodia and in endocytic invagina - tions on the bottom surface of plasma membrane ( Fig . 14 in the Supplementary Appendix , and video , available at NEJM . org ) , whereas the EGFP - tagged mutant A159P Myo1E was mainly cytosolic ( Fig . 14 in the Supplementary Appendix ) . In contrast to wild - type Myo1E , the A159P mutant did not stain with an anti - Myo1E anti - body , suggesting conformational changes in the mutant protein ( Fig . 9 in the Supplementary Ap - pendix ) . GFP - tagged wild - type Myo1E substan - tially costained with F - actin at the podocyte plas - ma membrane , whereas the A159P mutant did not colocalize with F - actin ( Fig . 4G and 4H ) . Wild - type Myo1E partially colocalized with CD2AP at the cell surface , whereas A159P Myo1E and CD2AP costain - ing was mainly cytoplasmic and often punctate ( Fig . 4I and Fig . 4J ) . Wild - type Myo1E overexpres - sion increased human podocyte motility ( Fig . 4K ) . In contrast , A159P Myo1E had no effect on podocyte motility . Conversely , Myo1E knockdown in human podocytes ( Fig . 4K ) and Myo1E knock - out in mouse podocytes impaired migration ( un - published data ) . A159P Myo1E transfection did not modify alpha - actinin - 4 , podocin , or nephrin expression in podocytes ( Fig . 15 and 16 in the Supplementary Appendix ) . Discussion This study identifies two mutations in MYO1E , which encodes myosin 1E ( a nonmuscle class I myosin ) . These mutations are closely associated with autosomal recessive focal segmental glomer - ulosclerosis , and several findings support their potential causative role in the development of this disorder : first , the segregation of the mutations with the disease ; second , the absence of the mu - tations in a large number of controls ; third , the mutations occurring in important functional do - mains ; fourth , the specific expression of Myo1E in A video showing microscopy of Myo1E in infected mouse podocytes is available at NEJM . org Figure 2 ( facing page ) . Identification of MYO1E Mutations in Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis . Panel A shows a parametric , multipoint logarithm - of - the - odds ( LOD ) score profile across the human genome , as calculated in the index family . There is a single positive peak on human chromosome 15 . Panel B shows sequencing electropherograms of the index family ( left ) and Family 2 ( right ) . The affected child in the index family has a homozygous G→C substitution ( arrow ) , and the unaffected father is heterozygous for the mutation . The affected child in Family 2 has a homo - zygous T→G substitution ( arrow ) , and the unaffected mother is heterozygous for the mutation . The two lower - most electropherograms are from healthy controls . Panel C shows the functional domains in the myosin 1E protein ( Myo1E ) . Myo1E contains a motor - head do - main ( including a phosphate - binding loop [ P - loop ] and the switch - 1 and switch - 2 loops ) , which binds ATP and F - actin ( actin binding site ) ; a light - chain – binding neck domain ( IQ ) , which binds calmodulin ; and a tail domain , which contains the lipid - binding tail homology 1 ( TH1 ) domain , the proline - rich tail homology 2 ( TH2 ) domain , and the Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain . The Ala159Pro change is within the switch - 1 loop , and Y695X causes a truncation at the beginning of the neck domain . Panel D shows the sequence alignment of the Myo1E protein and its homologues among various species . The red box indicates the location of the highly conserved Ala159 amino acid that is changed to Pro ( P ) in the index family .

Expression of Recombinant Myo1E in Cultured Human Podocytes . Shown in Panels A through J are undifferentiated human podocytes transfected with green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) – tagged wild - type Myo1E , E753K Myo1E ( control SNP , rs8024923 ) , or mutant A159P Myo1E ( green , 1 μg plasmid ) and analyzed by means of confocal mi - croscopy ; the nuclei were stained with 4′ , 6 - diamidine - 2 - phenylidole dihydrochloride ( DAPI ) ( blue ) . Panel A shows untransfected human podocytes . Panels B , C , and D show human podocytes transfected with wild - type Myo1E , control E753K Myo1E , and mutant A159P Myo1E , respectively . Wild - type and control E753K Myo1E localize along the plasma membrane , while the A159P mutant shows a cytoplas - mic distribution . Transfection efficiency was about 30 % for the GFP - tagged wild - type , E753K , and A159P constructs ( determined by cal - culating the ratio of the number of green cells to the number of blue nuclei , multiplied by 100 , in 10 to 15 high - power fields ) . Panels E and F show staining of podocyte plasma membranes with rhodamine - labeled lectin ( red ) . GFP - tagged wild - type Myo1E partially colocal - izes with lectin ( Panel E , yellow ) , whereas the A159P mutant does not ( Panel F , green ) . The mislocalization of the mutant protein is not attributable to instability or degradation , since the sizes and amounts of the wild - type and A159P proteins expressed in transfected podocytes were the same on Western blotting ( see Fig . 13A and 13B in the Supplementary Appendix ) . Panels G and H show staining of F - actin filaments ( red ) in transfected human podocytes . GFP - tagged wild - type Myo1E ( Panel G ) partially colocalizes with F - actin ( yellow ) , whereas the A159P mutant does not ( Panel H , green ) . Panels I and J show staining with an anti – CD2 - associated protein ( CD2AP ) anti - body ( green ) . Myelocytomatosis virus – associated sequence ( MYC ) – tagged wild - type Myo1E ( Panel I , red ) partially colocalizes with CD2AP at the plasma membrane ( yellow ) , whereas in cells transfected with the MYC - tagged A159P mutant ( Panel J ) , MYC - tagged Myo1E , and CD2AP abnormally colocalize in the cytoplasm ( yellow ) . Panel K shows the results of a scrape - wound migration assay of cultured human podocytes . Transfection with GFP - tagged wild - type Myo1E ( WT ) increased podocyte migration , as compared with the migration of podocytes transfected with an empty GFP - tagged vector , whereas the GFP - tagged A159P Myo1E had no effect on migration . Knock - down of endogenous Myo1E by small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) reduced podocyte migration , as compared with the migration of podo - cytes transfected with universal scrambled siRNA .

The observed enrichment of Myo1E in podocyte processes in conjunction with F - actin filament tips implicates this protein as a key component of the foot - process cytoskeleton . 27 Myo1E is im - portant for podocyte structure and spreading on the extracellular matrix , as documented by the observation that Myo1e - deficient mice have defects in podocyte organization , with foot - process efface - ment . 19 The phenotype of Myo1e - deficient mice is characterized by proteinuria , hemoglobinuria , glo - merulosclerosis , and impaired renal function 19 — features that are also present in patients with MYO1E mutations . Glomeruli of both Myo1e - defi - cient mice 19 and the patient with the Y695X muta - tion have peculiar ultrastructural features , with thickening and disorganization of the glomerular basement membrane , suggesting that Myo1E plays a role in regulating the crosstalk between podo - cytes and their matrix . Nonmuscle myosin activity generates tension , and the interaction among actin , myosins , and alpha - actinin - 4 probably allows the foot process - es to generate the contractile forces that help the glomerular capillaries to resist the high intralu - minal hydrostatic pressure and to change their morphologic structure actively , modifying the per - meability of the glomerular filtration barrier . 26 , 30 , 31 Mutations in MYH9 , encoding the nonmuscle myo - sin IIa heavy chain , cause autosomal dominant disorders with macrothrombocytopenia , leukocyte inclusions , and in some cases , glomerulopathy . 32 Multiple MYH9 SNPs have been associated with idiopathic and human immunodeficiency virus – related focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and with hypertensive end - stage renal disease in blacks . 33 However , a follow - up study indicated that the strongest association no longer clustered in MYH9 but rather in the neighboring APOL1 . 34 The A159P missense mutation we identified impairs the ability of Myo1E to promote podocyte motility , which is consistent with 159P localiza - tion within the switch - 1 loop in the motor - head domain of Myo1E . The switch - 1 loop is highly conserved among myosins and , together with the phosphate - binding loop and the switch - 2 loop , forms the ATP - binding domain of myosins . 24 In both human and mouse podocytes , the A159P Myo1E mutant ( in contrast with wild - type Myo1E ) was mislocalized to the cytoplasm , indicating an important role for the switch - 1 loop in the proper subcellular distribution of Myo1E . Mutations in the switch - 1 loop of another nonmuscle myosin ( MYO7A ) cause type 1B Usher’s syndrome ( deafness and retinitis pigmentosa ) , 35 confirming the impor - tant role of the switch - 1 loop in nonmuscle myosin function . The second mutation causes the formation of a truncated protein that lacks the calmodulin do - main , which is important for calcium - mediated regulation of actin binding and ATP hydrolysis , 36 and that lacks the tail domain , which probably results in a nonfunctional protein , mimicking the condition of Myo1e - deficient mice . Indeed , the glo - merular ultrastructural lesions in Patient 4 and in Myo1e - deficient mice were quite similar . Although Myo1E is expressed in several tissues , neither the patients with MYO1E mutations nor Myo1e - deficient mice had any extrarenal involvement , indicating that Myo1E is not required for the normal func - tioning of extrarenal tissues and organs . The patients with MYO1E mutations and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis had glucocorticoid resistance , although three of them had a partial response to cyclosporine therapy . Cyclosporine reduces proteinuria in up to 70 % of patients with glucocorticoid - resistant focal segmental glomer - ulosclerosis , but relapse occurs in 40 to 60 % . 37 , 38 Recently , the antiproteinuric effect of cyclosporine in glucocorticoid - resistant focal segmental glomer - u losclerosis has been attributed to the drug’s direct stabilizing effects on the podocyte cytoskeleton rather than to its immunosuppressive actions . 39 , 40 Whether such mechanisms may have limited the deleterious consequences of MYO1E mutations re - mains to be clarified . End - stage renal disease de - veloped in one affected member in each family , whereas the other affected family members had milder courses , possibly attributable to earlier di - agnosis ( in the index family ) or to effective anti - proteinuric treatment ( in Family 2 ) .

MYO1E mutations do not ap - pear to be a common cause of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis , since we have found only two independent MYO1E mutations among 29 unre - lated patients with familial focal segmental glo - merulosclerosis and none among those with spo - radic cases . Both mutations were homozygous , suggesting that Myo1E - associated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis might be restricted to families with some degree of consanguinity . In conclu - sion , these studies show that MYO1E mutations have a role in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and suggest the importance of Myo1E in podo - cyte homeostasis and the consequent integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier .
