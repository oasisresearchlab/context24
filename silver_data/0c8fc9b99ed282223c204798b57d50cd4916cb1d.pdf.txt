Nature GeNetics VOLUME 42 | NUMBER 11 | NOVEMBER 2010 1021 N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptors mediate excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian brain . Two glycine - binding NR1 subunits and two glutamate - binding NR2 subunits each form highly Ca 2 + - permeable cation channels which are blocked by extracellular Mg 2 + in a voltage - dependent manner 1 . Either GRIN2B or GRIN2A , encoding the NMDA receptor subunits NR2B and NR2A , was found to be disrupted by chromosome translocation breakpoints in individuals with mental retardation and / or epilepsy . Sequencing of GRIN2B in 468 individuals with mental retardation revealed four de novo mutations : a frameshift , a missense and two splice - site mutations . In another cohort of 127 individuals with idiopathic epilepsy and / or mental retardation , we discovered a GRIN2A nonsense mutation in a three - generation family . In a girl with early - onset epileptic encephalopathy , we identified the de novo GRIN2A mutation c . 1845C > A predicting the amino acid substitution p . N615K . Analysis of NR1 - NR2A N615K ( NR2A subunit with the p . N615K alteration ) receptor currents revealed a loss of the Mg 2 + block and a decrease in Ca 2 + permeability . Our findings suggest that disturbances in the neuronal electrophysiological balance during development result in variable neurological phenotypes depending on which NR2 subunit of NMDA receptors is affected . NMDA receptors are neurotransmitter - gated ion channels involved in regulation of synaptic function in the central nervous system 1 . The identity of the specific NR2 subunit ( A , B , C or D ) determines many of the physiological and pharmacological properties of NMDA receptors 2 . Inappropriate activation of NMDA receptors has been implicated in several neurological conditions , such as Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia 3 , however , single gene mutations in subunits of the NMDA receptors have not yet been reported in Mendelian disorders . Many human disease genes have been identi - fied by breakpoint mapping of chromosome rearrangements 4 – 7 . We ascertained two male subjects with de novo chromosome transloca - tions , 46 , XY , t ( 9 ; 12 ) ( p23 ; p13 . 1 ) and 46 , XY , t ( 10 ; 12 ) ( q21 . 1 ; p13 . 1 ) , and a common breakpoint in 12p13 . 1 . Subject 1 was referred to the study at the age of 2 years because of mild to moderate mental retardation , behavioral anomalies and abnormal electroencephalogram ( EEG ) . Subject 2 was a 12 - year - old boy with a more complex phenotype including severe mental retardation , behavioral and EEG anomalies , and ophthalmological and other manifestations ( Table 1 ) . Using serial fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) experiments to delineate translocation breakpoints , we found both breakpoints in 12p13 . 1 to disrupt GRIN2B , which encodes the NR2B subunit of NMDA recep - tors ( Fig . 1a , b and Supplementary Figs . 1 and 2 ) . In light of the neurodevelopmental phenotype of both subjects with translocations , we hypothesized GRIN2B to be the phenocritical gene .

Transgenic overexpression of Grin2b in the forebrain of mice and in the cortex and hippocampus of rats results in superior performance in various tests of learning and memory 9 , 10 . Thus , Grin2b seems to represent a rate - limiting genetic factor in gating the NMDA receptor’s function in the developing and adult mammalian brain , strongly suggesting involve - ment of NR2 subunits in human brain function and cognition . This assumption was further corroborated by our finding of a third translocation , t ( 16 ; 17 ) ( p13 . 2 ; q11 . 2 ) , disrupting GRIN2A , the gene encoding the NR2A subunit . The 16 ; 17 translocation was found to co - segregate with epilepsy and a variable degree of cognitive impair - ment in a family ( Fig . 1c – e and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) .

Nature GeNetics VOLUME 42 | NUMBER 11 | NOVEMBER 2010 1023 l e t t e r s at the end of their first decade that spontaneously decreased during adolescence . All four family members had behavioral problems , and subject 3 - 4 also had moderate mental retardation ( Table 2 ) . GRIN2A was an excellent candidate gene based on the crucial role of NMDA receptors in neuronal maturation and excitatory synaptic transmis - sion . In addition , submicroscopic deletions in 16p13 encompassing GRIN2A , among other genes , have recently been associated with intel - lectual disability and epilepsy 11 . Grin2a knockout mice show increased spontaneous locomotor activity and deficits in contextual fear conditioning and spatial learn - ing , along with reduced hippocampal long - term potentiation that is the cellular basis for learning and memory 12 , 13 . The phenotype of Grin2b - deficient mice is more severe , as they die perinatally due to severe developmental brain defects 12 , 14 . These data together with our finding of disrupted GRIN2A or GRIN2B in individuals with variable neurodevelopmental phenotypes strongly suggest that any disturbance in the number and / or composition of NMDA receptors has profound effects on neuronal development and activity in humans . We further substantiated this hypothesis through detection of point mutations in individuals with mental retardation and / or epilepsy . Two cohorts of affected individuals were screened for mutations in GRIN2B ; the first cohort consisted of 315 individuals with mental retardation ( 185 with mild to moderate mental retardation and 130 with moderate to severe mental retardation ) and the second cohort consisted of 153 individuals ( 73 with mild to moderate mental retardation and 57 with moderate to severe mental retardation , and in 23 individuals , the severity of mental retardation was unspecified ) . We sequenced GRIN2A in a third cohort comprising 127 individuals with a history of idiopathic epilepsy and / or abnormal EEG and a variable degree of mental retardation . We identified four individuals with moderate mental retardation and behavioral anomalies who had a heterozygous de novo GRIN2B mutation : c . 411 + 1G > A in subject 4 , c . 2044C > T in subject 5 , c . 2360 - 2A > G in subject 8 and c . 803 _ 804delCA in subject 9 ( all parental identities were confirmed ; Table 1 and Supplementary Tables 1 – 3 ) . The c . 2044C > T mutation was absent in 1 , 080 control chromosomes and the other three mutations observed were absent in 360 control chromosomes . In silico analysis using splice site prediction programs confirmed that c . 411 + 1G > A and c . 2360 - 2A > G disrupt the splice donor and acceptor site , respectively , and likely result in altered splicing 15 ( Supplementary Table 3 ) .

However , heterozygosity of rs7301328 ( c . 366C > G ) in exon 2 of GRIN2B was only found in genomic DNA ( gDNA ) and not in cDNA of both of these individuals ( Fig . 2a ) . This suggests monoallelic expression of the wild - type allele due to nonsense - mediated mRNA decay of aberrantly spliced GRIN2B transcripts . In contrast , we identified GRIN2B mRNAs with a pre - mature stop codon ( PTC ) in subject 9 carrying the 2 - bp deletion c . 803 _ 804delCA ( resulting in p . T268SfsX15 ) , indicating that GRIN2B transcripts with a PTC are not efficiently degraded ( Fig . 2b ) . The c . 2044C > T mutation predicts the amino acid substitution p . R682C , affecting a highly conserved arginine within the glutamate - binding NR2B ligand - binding domain ( LBD ) 1 ( Fig . 3a and Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . Our model of the NR2B LBD predicts strong intra - LBD inter - actions between the guanidinium group of R682 with the carboxyl group of D727 and a backbone carbonyl oxygen of an adjacent helical structure ( Fig . 3b ) . The p . R682C alteration results in a loss of three hydrogen bonds , thereby destabilizing the tertiary structure of the NR2B LBD ( Fig . 3b , inset ) , which may affect glutamate affinity in a way similar to the substitution of neighboring residues 16 , 17 . However , analysis of agonist dose - response curves revealed no differences in the affinities of both glutamate and glycine of wild - type NR1 - NR2B and mutant NR1 - NR2B R682C NMDA receptors ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . This data suggests that the p . R682C substitution may alter NMDA receptor function through other mechanisms . We likewise identified two point mutations in GRIN2A ( Table 2 and Supplementary Tables 1 – 3 ) . First , we found the heterozygous c . 652C > T transition , resulting in a premature stop codon ( p . Q218X ) , in a 4 - year - old individual ( subject 6 - 1 ) with mild to moderate mental retardation and abnormal EEG . His mother ( subject 6 - 2 ) and maternal grandmother ( subject 6 - 3 ) also carried the c . 652C > T mutation . Both the subject’s mother and grandmother had a history of seizures during early childhood ( Table 2 ) . RNA analysis in subject 6 - 1 revealed monoallelic expression of the wild - type allele , suggest - ing that GRIN2A transcripts with the PTC were efficiently degraded by nonsense - mediated mRNA decay ( Fig . 2c ) . The second mutation we identified was the heterozygous de novo c . 1845C > A transversion found in a 3 - year - old girl ( subject 7 , whose parental identity was confirmed ) with early - onset epileptic encephalopathy , abnormal EEG and severe developmental delay ( Table 2 ) . The c . 652C > T mutation was absent in 360 control chromosomes and the c . 1845C > A mutation was absent in 1 , 080 control chromosomes . The latter change pre - dicts the substitution of an evolutionarily conserved asparagine for a lysine ( p . N615K ) in the membrane re - entrant loop ( the P - loop ) of the NR2A subunit ( Fig . 3a and Supplementary Fig . 4b ) , which deter - mines the narrow constriction and ion selectivity of the channel 18 . Because conversion of the polar residue N615 at the tip of the pore loop to an uncharged side chain has been shown to alter inward - current rectification by Mg 2 + ( ref . 19 ) , p . N615K likely has a strong impact on NMDA channel properties ( Fig . 3c ) . Indeed , analyzing voltage dependence of NR1 - NR2A N615K receptor currents revealed loss of the Mg 2 + block and a decrease in Ca 2 + permeability ( Fig . 3d , e ) . Co - expression of wild - type NR2A and mutant NR2A N615K resulted in intermediate effects ( Fig . 3d ) , indicating a negative impact of p . N615K on the channel properties of heterooligomeric NR1 - NR2A - NR2A N615K NMDA receptors . Taken together , disruption of GRIN2A in the translocation subjects and the nonsense alteration p . Q218X most likely lead to functional null alleles associated with a relatively mild phenotype comprising epilepsy and variable cognitive impairment . However , the more severe phenotype in subject 7 with p . N615K can be explained by a dominant negative effect on NMDA receptor function .

Nature GeNetics VOLUME 42 | NUMBER 11 | NOVEMBER 2010 1025 l e t t e r s The functional properties of NMDA receptors depend on subunit composition , with the NR2 subunits controlling channel kinetics and synaptic signaling 3 . The composition of native NMDA receptors undergoes a developmental change from heterotetramers containing predominantly NR2B at the early stages of development to those con - taining NR2B , NR2A or both subunits at a mature stage 1 . Regulation of the NR2A : NR2B ratio of synaptic NMDA receptors is thought to be a major determinant of the developmental and experience - dependent properties of synaptic plasticity 20 . The concept that the remodeling of the number and composition of synaptic NMDA receptors is important for neuronal activity and development is reflected by the different neurodevelopmental phenotypes in individuals with a heterozygous GRIN2A or a GRIN2B mutation ; whereas mutations in the prenatally expressed GRIN2B lead to cognitive defects , muta - tions in the postnatally expressed GRIN2A cause epilepsy as the most consistent clinical feature . Recently , risk haplotypes of GRIN1 , encoding the NR1 subunit of NMDA receptors , have been associated with infantile spasms , further indicating an involvement of NMDA receptors in epileptogenesis 21 . The precise pathophysiological con - sequences of the GRIN2A and GRIN2B mutations remain to be eluci - dated . We hypothesize that both loss - of - function mutations causing a change in NMDA receptor composition and / or number and missense mutations leading to abnormal NR2 subunit function may affect neuronal ion flux and electrical transmission between neurons in the human brain .

This study was approved by all institutional review boards of the participating institutions , and written informed consent was obtained from all participants or their legal guardians . Genome - wide array comparative genomic hybridization ( aCGH ) . Subject 1 . We obtained genomic DNA from a healthy male 46 , XY ( G147A , Promega ) . aCGH was performed using commercial Agilent oligo CGH arrays ( 244K arrays , Agilent Technologies ) consisting of ~ 244 , 000 in situ synthesized 60 - mer oligo - nucleotides spanning the entire genome , resulting in an average genomic dis - tance of ~ 12 kb . These probes included both coding and non - coding sequences on each human chromosome . For hybridization , we digested 3 μ g of genomic DNA from the reference sample ( 46 , XY ) and 3 μ g of genomic DNA from sub - ject 1 with Alu I ( 20 units ) and Rsa I ( 20 units ) ( Promega ) . All restrictions were done for a minimum of 2 h at 37 °C then heat inactivated at 65 °C for 20 min and verified by agarose gel electrophoresis . Labeling reactions were performed with 3 μ g of restricted DNA and the Agilent Genomic DNA Labeling Kit PLUS ( Agilent Techologies ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions in a total volume of 50 μ l with a modified dNTP pool containing dATP , dGTP , dCTP and dTTP , and Cy5 - dUTP ( for subject 1 ) or Cy3 - dUTP ( for the 46 , XY reference ) . Labeled targets were subsequently filtered twice with ×1 TE - buffer at pH 8 . 0 ( Promega ) through a Centricon YM - 30 column ( Millipore ) and concentrated to 80 . 5 μ l . The amount and specific activity of the Cy3 - and Cy5 - labeled samples were determined by using the Nanodrop ND - 1000 UV - VIS Spectrophotometer ( Peqlab ) and the microarray measurement protocol . The manufacturer’s recom - mendations ( Agilent Technologies ) were followed for selecting or rejecting the probes for hybridization . Hybridization and features extraction were performed as described 22 , 23 , and data were visualized by means of the CGH Analytics 3 . 4 software ( Agilent Technologies ) . Subject 2 . Whole - genome aCGH analysis was performed using a 400K oligo - nucleotide array ( Agilent ) according to protocols provided by the manufac - turer . Image analysis , normalization and annotation were based on Feature Extraction 9 . 1 ( Agilent ) using the default settings , and visualization of data was performed with the CGHPRO software 24 . Subject 3 - 1 . aCGH was performed using the Human Genome CGH Microarray 244A platform ( Agilent Technologies ) . Experimental procedures were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions with slight modifications . One microgram of DNA from subject 3 - 1 and one microgram of reference DNA from a pool of 10 healthy donors with a normal male karyotype were hybridized . The array was scanned with the Axon GenePix 4000B microarray scanner ( Axon Instruments ) at a resolution of 5 μ m / pixel . Signal intensities from the generated images were measured and evaluated with the Feature Extraction v9 . 5 . 3 and CGH Analytics v4 . 0 . 81 software pack - ages ( Agilent Technologies ) . Lymphoblastoid cells . Lymphoblastoid cell lines were established according to standard protocols and cultured in RPMI medium ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with 15 % FCS medium , 580 mg / l L - glutamine , 110 mg / l sodium pyruvate , penicillin and streptomycin ( 100 U / ml and 100 μ g / ml , respectively ) and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 10 % CO 2 . Two hours before preparation of metaphase spreads , cells were incubated with 0 . 2 μ g / ml colcemide ( Sigma Aldrich ) . Fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) . Metaphase spreads from periph - eral blood lymphocytes or lymphoblastoid cells were prepared by standard procedures . FISH experiments for the delineation of the 9p23 , 10q21 . 1 , 12p13 . 1 , 16p13 . 2 and 17q11 . 2 breakpoints were performed with BAC and fosmid clones ( Supplementary Tables 4 – 6 ) . BACs ( RPCI - 11 libraries 753 and 737 ) were obtained from ImaGenes or from the BACPAC Resources Center ( BPRC ) . Fosmid clones ( library WIBR - 2 ) were obtained from the BPRC . BAC and fosmid DNA was prepared using the NucleoBond Xtra Midi kit ( Machery - Nagel ) . DNA was labeled by nick translation using the CGH Nick Translation Kit and Spectrum Green - dUTP or Spectrum Orange - dUTP ( Vysis ) according to the protocols provided . Chromosomes were counterstained using 4 ′ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) ( Serva Feinbiochemica ) and mounted in antifading solution ( Vector Labs ) . Slides were evaluated using an epifluorescence microscope ( Leica DMRA ) that was fitted with different single band - pass filter sets for DAPI , Spectrum Green and Spectrum Orange fluorescence . Images were captured using a cooled charged - couple device ( CCD ) camera ( Pieper ) and Cyto Vision software ( Applied Imaging ) . Mutation analysis . GRIN2B . Genomic DNA was isolated from blood lym - phocytes according to standard procedures . DNA samples from the first cohort of 315 individuals with mental retardation and the second cohort of 153 indi - viduals with mental retardation were amplified by whole genome amplification using the GenomiPhi V2 DNA amplification kit ( GE Healthcare ) . The DNA samples were screened for GRIN2B mutations by unidirectional sequencing of all GRIN2B exons ( 1 – 13 ) , including flanking intronic regions , using the ABI BigDye Terminator Sequencing Kit ( Applied Biosystems ) and an automated capillary sequencer ( ABI 3730 , Applied Biosystems ) . PCR and sequencing reaction cleanup were performed with the Biomek NXP workstation using the Agencourt AMPure PCR purification system and the Agencourt CleanSEQ Dye Terminator Removal kit ( Beckman - Coulter ) . Mutations were confirmed by independent PCR and bidirectional sequencing using the subjects’ original DNA samples . Sequence analysis was done with the Sequencing Analysis v . 3 . 6 . 1 ( Applied Biosystems ) and the Sequencher 4 . 9 ( Gene Codes Corporation ) soft - ware packages . Primer sequences ( Supplementary Table 7 ) were determined using the Exon Primer program from the UCSC genome browser ( see URLs ) and the primers were supplied by Thermo Fisher Scientific . GRIN2A . We analyzed a cohort of 127 individuals with a history of epilepsy , an abnormal EEG pattern and a variable degree of mental retardation for GRIN2A mutations . We amplified the coding region , including the flank - ing intronic sequences , of GRIN2A ( 14 exons in total ) from genomic DNA . Primer sequences are summarized in Supplementary Table 8 . Amplicons were directly sequenced either as described above or using the ABI BigDye Terminator Sequencing Kit ( Applied Biosystems ) and an automated capillary sequencer ( ABI 3130 , Applied Biosystems ) . Sequence electropherograms were analyzed using Sequence Pilot software ( JSI medical systems ) . Where mutations were shown to have arisen de novo , we verified self - reported relationships by genotyping both parents and the subject at a minimum of fifteen microsatellite loci . Computational analyses . Splice site prediction of intronic variants identified in GRIN2A and GRIN2B were calculated by using the online tools HSF V2 . 4 ( ref . 25 ) , SpliceView , the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project ( BDGP ) 26 and the NetGene2 server 27 . See URLs . Prediction of potential deleterious effects of missense mutations detected in GRIN2A and GRIN2B was performed using the software tools SIFT 28 , PolyPhen 29 , SNAP 30 and PANTHER 7 . 0 Beta 31 . See URLs . GRIN2A and GRIN2B transcript analysis . RNA was isolated from fresh blood leukocytes from subjects 4 , 6 - 1 , 8 and 9 using the PAXgene Blood RNA System ( PreAnalytics ) according to the manufacturer’s recommenda - tions . First - strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 – 2 μ g of RNA using the Omniscript Reverse Transcriptase Kit ( Qiagen ) and gene - specific oligonu - cleotides . Of a total of 20 μ l of volume from the reaction , 1 μ l was used as template to amplify transcripts by using primer pairs spanning different exon - exon junctions in nested PCR reactions . Amplicons were directly sequenced or cloned into pCR2 . 1 TOPO TA Cloning Vector ( Invitrogen ) . Escherichia coli clones were subjected to colony PCR , and PCR products from individual clones were sequenced . Molecular modeling of NMDA receptor domains . Sequence alignment of the NMDA receptor subunits was taken from a previous study 32 or performed using ClustalX 2 . 0 . 12 ( see URLs ) . Molecular modeling of the transmembrane domains of NR1 - NR2A and the LBDs of NR1 - NR2B receptors was based on the crystal structure of GluR2 ( Brookhaven Protein Data Bank entry 3KG2 ) 32 and of the NR1 - NR2A LBD ( PDB ID 2A5T ) 33 , respectively , by using Modeller 9v6 ( Sali lab at the University of California , San Francisco ) 34 and lsqman 9 . 7 . 9 ( Uppsala © 2010 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . Nature GeNetics doi : 10 . 1038 / ng . 677 Software Factory ) 35 . Models were subjected to short term molecular dynamics simulations using the Charmm27 force field , which is implemented in the Tinker 4 . 2 molecular modeling software ( see URLs ) . Figures were made using PyMOL 1 . 2 ( see URLs ) . cDNA constructs , oocyte expression and electrophysiology . cDNA con - structs encoding the mouse NR1 - 1a , NR2A and NR2B subunits have been described previously 36 . We introduced mutations with the QuikChange site - directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene , Agilent Technologies ) using mutagenesis primers and identified positive clones by DNA sequencing . We obtained and injected collagenase - defolliculated Xenopus laevis oocytes ( stages 5 or 6 ) with capped cRNAs as described previously 37 . We kept oocytes at 19 °C in sterile frog Ringer’s solution ( ORi : 90 mM NaCl , 1 mM KCl , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 and 10 mM HEPES at pH 7 . 4 ) supplemented with 50 mg / l gentamy - cin . At 1 – 3 days after cRNA injection , we measured glycine and glutamate dose - response curves in the presence of saturating concentrations of the corresponding agonist ( 10 μ M and 100 μ M , respectively ) by two - electrode voltage clamping ( TEVC ) at a holding potential of −70 mV as described pre - viously 37 . Concentration - response curves and current traces shown in the figures were drawn using KaleidaGraph ( Synergy Software ) . To monitor the voltage dependence of NR1 - NR2A receptor combinations , whole - cell current - voltage relationships of saturating glutamate - and glycine - induced currents were recorded in 20 mV - intervals ranging from −90 mV to + 30 mV and nor - malized to the current value obtained at + 30 mV above the respective reversial potential ( E rev ) . Data points were aligned by using a third order polynomial fit 38 . The relative divalent to monovalent permeability ( P div / P mono ) was calculated by the Goldman - Hodgkin - Katz constant field ( GHK ) voltage equation assum - ing no anion permeability as described 38 . The internal concentrations of Na + and K + used in the calculations were 20 mM and 150 mM , respectively 38 . Permeability ratios were calculated for each oocyte and then averaged . In order to avoid the activation of the oocytes’ native Ca 2 + - sensitive chloride currents , all experiments were carried out in oocytes incubated for 30 min at 20 – 25 °C with the membrane - permeant Ca 2 + chelator 1 , 2 - bis ( 2 - amino - phenoxy ) ethane - N , N , N ′ , N ′ - tetraacetic acid - acetoxymethyl ester ( BAPTA - AM , 100 μ M ) before electrophysiological recordings . Mg 2 + inhibition ( 1 mM ) was evaluated in the presence of 1 . 8 mM Ca 2 + at a holding potential of −70 mV upon application ( 5 s ) of saturating glycine ( 10 μ M ) and glutamate ( 100 μ M ) concentrations . Statistical analyses . Values given represent means ± standard deviation . Statistical significance was determined at the P < 0 . 05 ( * ) , P < 0 . 01 ( * * ) and P < 0 . 001 ( * * * ) levels using a Student’s two - tailed unpaired t - test . 22 . Barrett , M . T . et al .
