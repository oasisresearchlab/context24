Interactive - engagement versus traditional methods : A six - thousand - student survey of mechanics test data for introductory physics courses Richard R . Hake a ) Department of Physics , Indiana University , Bloomington , Indiana 47405 (cid:126) Received 6 May 1996 ; accepted 4 May 1997 (cid:33) A survey of pre / post - test data using the Halloun – Hestenes Mechanics Diagnostic test or more recent Force Concept Inventory is reported for 62 introductory physics courses enrolling a total number of students N (cid:53) 6542 . A consistent analysis over diverse student populations in high schools , colleges , and universities is obtained if a rough measure of the average effectiveness of a course in promoting conceptual understanding is taken to be the average normalized gain (cid:94) g (cid:38) . The latter is deﬁned as the ratio of the actual average gain ( % (cid:94) post (cid:38) (cid:50) % (cid:94) pre (cid:38) ) to the maximum possible average gain ( 100 (cid:50) % (cid:94) pre (cid:38) ) . Fourteen ‘‘traditional’’ ( T ) courses ( N (cid:53) 2084 ) which made little or no use of interactive - engagement (cid:126) IE (cid:33) methods achieved an average gain (cid:94) g (cid:38) T - ave (cid:53) 0 . 23 (cid:54) 0 . 04 (cid:126) std dev (cid:33) . In sharp contrast , 48 courses ( N (cid:53) 4458 ) which made substantial use of IE methods achieved an average gain (cid:94) g (cid:38) IE - ave (cid:53) 0 . 48 (cid:54) 0 . 14 (cid:126) std dev (cid:33) , almost two standard deviations of (cid:94) g (cid:38) IE - ave above that of the traditional courses . Results for 30 ( N (cid:53) 3259 ) of the above 62 courses on the problem - solving Mechanics Baseline test of Hestenes – Wells imply that IE strategies enhance problem - solving ability . The conceptual and problem - solving test results strongly suggest that the classroom use of IE methods can increase mechanics - course effectiveness well beyond that obtained in traditional practice . © 1998 American Association of Physics Teachers . I . INTRODUCTION There has been considerable recent effort to improve in - troductory physics courses , especially after 1985 when Hal - loun and Hestenes 1 published a careful study using massive pre - and post - course testing of students in both calculus and non - calculus - based introductory physics courses at Arizona State University . Their conclusions were : (cid:126) 1 (cid:33) ‘‘ . . . the stu - dent’s initial qualitative , common - sense beliefs about motion and . . . (cid:126) its (cid:33) . . . causes have a large effect on performance in physics , but conventional instruction induces only a small change in those beliefs . ’’ (cid:126) 2 (cid:33) ‘‘Considering the wide differ - ences in the teaching styles of the four professors . . . (cid:126) involved in the study (cid:33) . . . the basic knowledge gain under conventional instruction is essentially independent of the professor . ’’ These outcomes were consistent with earlier ﬁndings of many researchers in physics education (cid:126) see Refs . 1 – 8 and citations therein (cid:33) which suggested that traditional passive - student introductory physics courses , even those delivered by the most talented and popular instructors , imparted little con - ceptual understanding of Newtonian mechanics . To what extent has the recent effort to improve introduc - tory physics courses succeeded ? In this article I report a sur - vey of all quantitative pre - / post - test results known to me (cid:126) in time to be included in this report (cid:33) which use the original Halloun – Hestenes Mechanics Diagnostic test (cid:126) MD (cid:33) , 1 (cid:126) a (cid:33) the more recent Force Concept Inventory (cid:126) FCI (cid:33) , 9 (cid:126) a (cid:33) , (cid:126) b (cid:33) and the problem - solving Mechanics Baseline (cid:126) MB (cid:33) 10 test . Both the MD and FCI were designed to be tests of students’ concep - tual understanding of Newtonian mechanics . One of their outstanding virtues is that the questions probe for conceptual understanding of basic concepts of Newtonian mechanics , in a way that is understandable to the novice who has never taken a physics course , while at the same time rigorous enough for the initiate . Most physicists would probably agree that a low score on the FCI / MD test indicates a lack of understanding of the basic concepts of mechanics . However , there have been re - cent con 11 and pro 12 arguments as to whether a high FCI score indicates the attainment of a uniﬁed force concept . Nevertheless , even the detractors have conceded that ‘‘the FCI is one of the most reliable and useful physics tests cur - rently available for introductory physics teachers’’ 11 (cid:126) a (cid:33) and that the FCI is ‘‘the best test currently available . . . to evaluate the effectiveness of instruction in introductory physics courses . ’’ 11 (cid:126) b (cid:33) While waiting for the fulﬁllment of calls for the development of better tests 11 or better analyses of exist - ing tests , 12 the present survey of published 1 (cid:126) a (cid:33) , 8 (cid:126) a (cid:33) , 9 (cid:126) a (cid:33) , 13 , 14 and unpublished 15 (cid:126) a (cid:33) , (cid:126) b (cid:33) classroom results may assist a much needed further improvement in introductory mechanics in - struction in light of practical experience . II . SURVEY METHOD AND OBJECTIVE Starting in 1992 , I requested that pre - / post - FCI test data and post - test MB data be sent to me in talks at numerous colloquia and meetings and in e - mail postings on the PHYS - L and PhysLrnR nets . 16 This mode of data solicitation tends to pre - select results which are biased in favor of out - standing courses which show relatively high gains on the FCI . When relatively low gains are achieved (cid:126) as they often are (cid:33) they are sometimes mentioned informally , but they are usually neither published nor communicated except by those who (cid:126) a (cid:33) wish to use the results from a ‘‘traditional’’ course at their institution as a baseline for their own data , or (cid:126) b (cid:33) pos - sess unusual scientiﬁc objectivity and detachment . Fortu - nately , several in the latter category contributed data to the present survey for courses in which interactive engagement methods were used but relatively low gains were achieved . Some suggestions (cid:126) Sec . VII (cid:33) for increasing course effective - ness have been gleaned from those cases . 17 Some may think that the present survey presents a nega - tively biased sampling of traditional courses , an attitude which has been known to change after perusal of local FCI test results . 18 It should be emphasized that all traditional - course pre - / post - test data known to me in time to be included 64 64 Am . J . Phys . 66 (cid:126) 1 (cid:33) , January 1998 © 1998 American Association of Physics Teachers in this report are displayed in Fig . 1 . More such data un - doubtedly exists but goes unreported because the gains are so embarrassingly minimal . For survey classiﬁcation and analysis purposes I deﬁne : (cid:126) a (cid:33) ‘‘Interactive Engagement’’ (cid:126) IE (cid:33) methods as those de - signed at least in part to promote conceptual under - standing through interactive engagement of students in heads - on ( always ) and hands - on ( usually ) activities which yield immediate feedback through discussion with peers and / or instructors , all as judged by their literature descriptions ; (cid:126) b (cid:33) ‘‘Traditional’’ ( T ) courses as those reported by in - structors to make little or no use of IE methods , relying primarily on passive - student lectures , recipe labs , and algorithmic - problem exams ; (cid:126) c (cid:33) Interactive Engagement (cid:126) IE (cid:33) courses as those reported by instructors to make substantial use of IE methods ; (cid:126) d (cid:33) average normalized gain (cid:94) g (cid:38) for a course as the ratio of the actual average gain (cid:94) G (cid:38) to the maximum possible average gain , i . e . , (cid:94) g (cid:38) (cid:91) % (cid:94) G (cid:38) / % (cid:94) G (cid:38) max (cid:53) (cid:126) % (cid:94) S f (cid:38) (cid:50) % (cid:94) S i (cid:38) (cid:33) / (cid:126) 100 (cid:50) % (cid:94) S i (cid:38) (cid:33) , (cid:126) 1 (cid:33) where (cid:94) S f (cid:38) and (cid:94) S i (cid:38) are the ﬁnal (cid:126) post (cid:33) and initial (cid:126) pre (cid:33) class averages ; (cid:126) e (cid:33) ‘‘High - g ’’ courses as those with ( (cid:94) g (cid:38) ) (cid:62) 0 . 7 ; (cid:126) f (cid:33) ‘‘Medium - g ’’ courses as those with 0 . 7 (cid:46) ( (cid:94) g (cid:38) ) (cid:62) 0 . 3 ; (cid:126) g (cid:33) ‘‘Low - g ’’ courses as those with ( (cid:94) g (cid:38) ) (cid:44) 0 . 3 . The present survey covers 62 introductory courses enroll - ing a total of 6542 students using the conceptual MD or FCI exams , and (cid:126) where available (cid:33) the problem - solving Mechan - ics Baseline (cid:126) MB (cid:33) test . Survey results for the conceptual and problem - solving exams are presented below in the form of graphs . In a companion paper , 17 (cid:126) a (cid:33) intended to assist instruc - tors in selecting and implementing proven IE methods , I tabulate , discuss , and reference the particular methods and materials that were employed in each of the 62 survey courses . Also tabulated in Ref . 17 (cid:126) a (cid:33) are data for each course : instructor’s name and institution , number of students enrolled , pre - / post - test scores , standard deviations where available , and normalized gains . Survey information was ob - tained from published accounts or private communications . The latter usually included instructor responses to a survey questionnaire 15 (cid:126) c (cid:33) which asked for information on the pre - / post - testing method ; statistical results ; institution ; type of students ; activities of the students ; and the instructor’s edu - cational experience , outlook , beliefs , orientation , resources , and teaching methods . As in any scientiﬁc investigation , bias in the detector can be put to good advantage if appropriate research objectives are established . We do not attempt to access the average effectiveness of introductory mechanics courses . Instead we seek to answer a question of considerable practical interest to physics teachers : Can the classroom use of IE methods in - crease the effectiveness of introductory mechanics courses well beyond that attained by traditional methods ? III . CONCEPTUAL TEST RESULTS A . Gain versus pre - test graph—all data To increase the statistical reliability (cid:126) Sec . V (cid:33) of averages over courses , only those with enrollments N (cid:62) 20 are plotted in Fig . 1 , although in some cases of fairly homogeneous instruction and student population (cid:126) AZ - AP , AZ - Reg , PL92 - C , TO , TO - C (cid:33) courses or sections with less than 20 students were included in a number - of - student - weighted av - erage . Course codes such as ‘‘AZ - AP’’ with corresponding enrollments and scores are tabulated and referenced in Ref . 17 (cid:126) a (cid:33) . In assessing the FCI , MD , and MB scores it should be kept in mind that the random guessing score for each of these ﬁve - alternative multiple - choice tests is 20 % . However , com - pletely non - Newtonian thinkers (cid:126) if they can at the same time read and comprehend the questions (cid:33) may tend to score below the random guessing level because of the very powerful interview - generated distractors . 1 (cid:126) a (cid:33) , 12 (cid:126) a (cid:33) It should be noted that for any particular course point ( (cid:94) G (cid:56) (cid:38) , (cid:94) S i (cid:56) (cid:38) ) on the (cid:94) G (cid:38) vs (cid:94) S i (cid:38) plot of Fig . 1 , the absolute value of the slope of a line connecting ( (cid:94) G (cid:56) (cid:38) , (cid:94) S i (cid:56) (cid:38) ) with the point (cid:126) (cid:94) G (cid:38) (cid:53) 0 , (cid:94) S i (cid:38) (cid:53) 100 (cid:33) is just the gain parameter (cid:94) g (cid:56) (cid:38) for that particular course . The regularities for courses with a wide range of average pretest scores (cid:64) 18 (cid:60) ( (cid:94) S i (cid:38) ) (cid:60) 71 (cid:35) and with diverse student populations in high schools , colleges , and universities are noteworthy : (cid:126) a (cid:33) All points for the 14 T courses ( N (cid:53) 2084 ) fall in the Low - g region . The data 17 (cid:126) a (cid:33) yield (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) 14 T (cid:53) 0 . 23 (cid:54) 0 . 04sd .

Slope lines for the average of the 14 T courses (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) 14 T and 48 IE courses (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) 48IE are shown , as explained in the text . 65 65 Am . J . Phys . , Vol . 66 , No . 1 , January 1998 Richard R . Hake data 17 (cid:126) a (cid:33) yield (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) 48IE (cid:53) 0 . 48 (cid:54) 0 . 14sd . (cid:126) 2b (cid:33) The slope lines (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) of Eqs . (cid:126) 2a (cid:33) and (cid:126) 2b (cid:33) are shown in Fig . 1 . (cid:126) c (cid:33) No course points lie in the ‘‘High - g ’’ region . I infer from features (cid:126) a (cid:33) , (cid:126) b (cid:33) , and (cid:126) c (cid:33) that a consistent analysis over diverse student populations with widely vary - ing initial knowledge states , as gauged by (cid:94) S i (cid:38) , can be ob - tained by taking the normalized average gain (cid:94) g (cid:38) as a rough measure of the effectiveness of a course in promoting con - ceptual understanding . This inference is bolstered by the fact that the correlation of (cid:94) g (cid:38) with (cid:94) S i (cid:38) for the 62 survey courses is a very low (cid:49) 0 . 02 . In contrast , the average post - test score (cid:94) S f (cid:38) and the average gain (cid:94) G (cid:38) are less suitable for compar - ing course effectiveness over diverse groups since their cor - relations with (cid:94) S i (cid:38) are , respectively , (cid:49) 0 . 55 and (cid:50) 0 . 49 . It should be noted that a positive correlation of (cid:94) S f (cid:38) with (cid:94) S i (cid:38) would be expected in the absence of instruction . Assuming , then , that (cid:94) g (cid:38) is a valid measure of course ef - fectiveness in promoting conceptual understanding , it ap - pears that the present interactive engagement courses are , on average , more than twice as effective in building basic con - cepts as traditional courses since (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) IE (cid:53) 2 . 1 (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) T . The difference (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) 48IE (cid:50) (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) 14 T (cid:53) 0 . 25 (cid:126) 2c (cid:33) is 1 . 8 standard deviations of (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) 48IE and 6 . 2 standard de - viations of (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) 14 T , reminiscent of that seen in comparing instruction delivered to students in large groups with one - on - one instruction . 19 Figure 2 shows the (cid:94) g (cid:38) - distribution for traditional ( T ) and interactive engagement (cid:126) IE (cid:33) courses plotted in Fig . 1 . Both distributions deviate from the symmetric Gaussian shape , but this does not invalidate characterization of the spread in the data by the standard deviation . The widths of the (cid:94) g (cid:38) distributions are evidently related to (cid:126) a (cid:33) statistical ﬂuctuations in (cid:94) g (cid:38) associated with widths of the pre - and post - test score distributions as gauged by their stan - dard deviations , plus (cid:126) b (cid:33) course - to - course variations in the ‘‘systematic errors , ’’ plus (cid:126) c (cid:33) course - to - course variations in the effectiveness of the pedagogy and / or implementation . I use the term ‘‘systematic errors’’ to mean that for a single course the errors would affect test scores in a systematic way , even though such errors might affect different courses in a more - or - less random way . Statistical ﬂuctuations and systematic errors in (cid:94) g (cid:38) are discussed below in Sec . V . Case studies 17 (cid:126) a (cid:33) of the IE courses in the low - end bump of the IE distribution strongly suggest that this bump is related to (cid:126) c (cid:33) in that various implementation problems are apparent , e . g . , insufﬁcient training of instructors new to IE methods , failure to communicate to students the nature of science and learn - ing , lack of grade incentives for taking IE activities seri - ously , a paucity of exam questions which probe the degree of conceptual understanding induced by the IE methods , and use of IE methods in only isolated components of a course . B . Gain versus pre - test graphs for high schools , colleges , and universities Figures 3 (cid:126) a (cid:33) , (cid:126) b (cid:33) , (cid:126) c (cid:33) show separate G vs S i plots for the 14 high school ( N (cid:53) 1113 ) , 16 college ( N (cid:53) 597 ) , and 32 university courses ( N (cid:53) 4832 ) . Although the enrollment N - weighted average pre - test scores increase with level 20 (cid:64) (cid:94) S i (cid:38) HS (cid:53) 28 % , (cid:94) S i (cid:38) C (cid:53) 39 % , (cid:94) S i (cid:38) U (cid:53) 48 % (cid:126) 44 % if the atypi - cally high Harvard scores are omitted (cid:33)(cid:35) , in other respects these three plots are all very similar to the plot of Fig . 1 for all courses . For high schools , colleges , and universities (cid:126) a (cid:33) T courses achieve low gains close to the average (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) T 14 (cid:53) 0 . 23 ; (cid:126) b (cid:33) IE courses are about equally effective : (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) 10IE (cid:126) HS (cid:33) (cid:53) 0 . 55 (cid:54) 0 . 11sd , (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) 13IE ( C ) (cid:53) 0 . 48 (cid:54) 0 . 12sd , and (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) 25IE ( U ) (cid:53) 0 . 45 (cid:54) 0 . 15sd (cid:126) 0 . 53 (cid:54) 0 . 09sd if the averaging omits the six atypical Low - g university courses (cid:33) . Figure 3 (cid:126) a (cid:33) shows that , for high schools , higher g ’s are obtained for honors than for regular courses , consistent with the observations of Hestenes et al . 9 (cid:126) a (cid:33) The difference between these two groups is perceived differently by different instruc - tors and may be school dependent : ‘‘the main difference is attitude ; ’’ 9 (cid:126) a (cid:33) ‘‘they differ in their ability to use quantitative representations of data to draw conceptual generalizations . . . motivation is . . . only part of the difference ; ’’ 21 ‘‘both sets . . . (cid:126) are (cid:33) . . . highly motivated . . . the major differences . . . (cid:126) are (cid:33) . . . their algebraic skills , the degree of conﬁdence in themselves , their ability to pay attention to detail , and their overall ability . ’’ 22 Motivational problems can be especially severe for students in IE courses who dislike any departure from the traditional methods to which they have become accustomed and under which their grades , if not their understanding , may have ﬂourished . 23 – 26 Enrollments for the college courses of Fig . 3 (cid:126) b (cid:33) are in the 20 – 61 range so that statistical ﬂuctuations associated with ‘‘random errors’’ (cid:126) Sec . V (cid:33) could be relatively important . However , the variations in (cid:94) g (cid:38) for the 11 Monroe Commu - nity College courses ( M ) have been explained 17 (cid:126) a (cid:33) by Paul D’Alessandris 27 as due to differences in the students or in the instruction : e . g . , ‘‘With regard to the . . .

This change is , hopefully , not a random ﬂuctuation but due to the changes in the workbook . All these were day courses . ’’ Such tracking of (cid:94) g (cid:38) with changes in IE method or implementation , also ob - served at Indiana University 17 (cid:126) a (cid:33) enhances conﬁdence in the use of (cid:94) g (cid:38) as a gauge of course effectiveness in building basic concepts . For university courses (cid:64) Fig . 3 (cid:126) c (cid:33)(cid:35) six of the IE courses are in the Low - g region—as previously indicated , detailed case studies 17 (cid:126) a (cid:33) strongly suggest that implementation problems are responsible .

IV . MECHANICS BASELINE TEST RESULTS The Mechanics Baseline test is designed to measure more quantitative aspects of student understanding than the FCI . It is usually given only as a post - test . Figure 4 shows a plot of the average percentage score on the problem - solving Me - chanics Baseline (cid:126) MB (cid:33) post - test versus the average percent - age score on the FCI post - test for all the available data . 17 (cid:126) a (cid:33) The solid line is a least - squares ﬁt to the data points . The two scores show an extremely strong positive correlation with coefﬁcient r (cid:53)(cid:49) 0 . 91 . Such a relationship is not unreason - able because the MB test (cid:126) unlike most traditional algorithmic - problem physics exams (cid:33) requires conceptual un - derstanding in addition to some mathematical skill and criti - cal thinking . Thus the MB test is more difﬁcult for the aver - age student , as is also indicated by the fact that MB averages tend to be about 15 % below FCI averages , i . e . , the least - squares - ﬁt line is nearly parallel to the diagonal ( % MB (cid:53) % FCI ) and about 15 % points below it . 42 It is sometimes objected that the problems on the MB test do not sufﬁciently probe more advanced abilities such as those required for problems known as : ‘‘context rich ; ’’ 32 ‘‘experiment ; ’’ 28 (cid:126) c (cid:33) ‘‘goal - less ; ’’ 27 (cid:126) b (cid:33) ‘‘out - of - lab ; ’’ 34 (cid:126) c (cid:33) or Fermi . On the other hand , some instructors object that nei - ther the MB problems nor those indicated above are ‘‘real’’ problems because they are somewhat different from ‘‘Halliday – Resnick problems . ’’ Considering the differences in outlook , it may be some time before a more widely ac - cepted problem - solving test becomes available . Figure 4 shows that IE courses generally show both higher FCI averages and higher MB averages than traditional courses , especially when the comparison is made for courses with similar student populations , e . g . , Cal Poly (cid:64) CP - C vs (cid:126) CP - RK - Rega - C , CP - RK - Regb - C , and CP - RK - Hon - C (cid:33)(cid:35) ; Harvard (cid:126) EM90 - C vs EM91 , 93 , 94 , 95 - C (cid:33) ; Monroe Commu - nity College (cid:126) MCC (cid:33) (cid:64) M93 vs other M - preﬁx courses (cid:35) ; Ari - zona high schools (cid:64)(cid:126) AZ - Reg & AZ - AP (cid:33) vs MW - Hon (cid:35) . Thus it would appear that problem - solving capability is actually enhanced (cid:126) not sacriﬁced as some would believe (cid:33) when con - cepts are emphasized . This is consistent with the observa - tions of Mazur 29 (cid:126) b (cid:33) and with the results of Thacker et al . , 43 showing that , at Ohio State , elementary - education majors taking an inquiry - based course did better than students en - rolled in a conventional physics courses for engineers on both a synthesis problem and an analysis problem . V . ERRORS IN THE NORMALIZED GAIN A . Statistical ﬂuctuations (cid:132) ‘‘random errors’’ (cid:133) The widths of the distributions of pre - and post - test scores as characterized by their standard deviations (cid:126) 7 % – 21 % of the total number of questions on the exam 17 (cid:126) a (cid:33) (cid:33) are quite large . In most cases these widths are not the result of experi - mental error but primarily reﬂect the varying characteristics of the students . If a multiplicity of understandings , abilities , skills , and attitudes affect test performance and these vary randomly among the students , then a near Gaussian distribu - tion would be expected for high N . Redish 44 calls this ‘‘the individuality or ‘linewidth’ principle . ’’ The large linewidths create ‘‘random error’’ uncertainties in the pre - and post - test averages and therefore statistical ﬂuctuations (cid:126) ‘‘random er - rors’’ (cid:33) (cid:68) (cid:94) g (cid:38) in the average normalized gains (cid:94) g (cid:38) . I have calculated (cid:68) (cid:94) g (cid:38) ’s in the conventional manner 45 , 46 for the 33 survey courses for which deviations are available . 17 (cid:126) a (cid:33) For this subset : (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) T 9 (cid:53) 0 . 24 (cid:54) 0 . 03sd , (cid:126) 3a (cid:33) (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) IE24 (cid:53) 0 . 50 (cid:54) 0 . 12sd , (cid:126) 3b (cid:33) similar to the averages and standard deviations for all the data as indicated in Eqs . (cid:126) 2a (cid:33) and (cid:126) 2b (cid:33) . The random error averages (cid:94) ( (cid:68) (cid:94) g (cid:38) ) (cid:38) for the subset are (cid:94) (cid:126) (cid:68) (cid:94) g (cid:38) (cid:33) (cid:38) T 9 (cid:53) 0 . 04 (cid:54) 0 . 02sd , (cid:126) 4a (cid:33) Fig . 4 . Average post - test scores on the problem - solving Mechanics Baseline (cid:126) MB (cid:33) test vs those on the conceptual FCI test for all courses of this survey for which data are available : thirty courses (cid:126) high school , college , and uni - versity (cid:33) which enroll a total N (cid:53) 3259 students (cid:64) Ref . 17 (cid:126) a (cid:33)(cid:35) . The solid line is a least - squares ﬁt to the data points . The dashed line is the diagonal repre - senting equal scores on the MB and FCI tests . Courses at Monroe Commu - nity College ( M ) with a ‘‘ ? ’’ designation had non - matching N MB (cid:46) N FCI because a few students who took the MB did not also take the FCI pre - test , as indicated in Ref . 17 (cid:126) a (cid:33) . If these ‘‘ ? ’’ points are excluded from the analy - ses , then the correlation coefﬁcient ‘‘ r ’’ changes by less than 0 . 1 % and the change in the position of the least - squares - ﬁt line is almost imperceptible on the scale of this ﬁgure . 68 68 Am . J . Phys . , Vol . 66 , No . 1 , January 1998 Richard R . Hake (cid:94) (cid:126) (cid:68) (cid:94) g (cid:38) (cid:33) (cid:38) IE24 (cid:53) 0 . 04 (cid:54) 0 . 02sd . (cid:126) 4b (cid:33) According to the usual interpretation , 45 if only random errors are present then the standard deviation for an average of averages , Eq . (cid:126) 3 (cid:33) , should be about the same as the uncer - tainty in any one average , Eq . (cid:126) 4 (cid:33) . (cid:64) For a numerical example see Ref . 45 (cid:126) b (cid:33) . (cid:35) This would suggest that , for the subset , the spread ( sd (cid:53) 0 . 03 ) in the (cid:94) g (cid:38) T distribution can be accounted for primarily by random errors (cid:64) (cid:94) ( (cid:68) (cid:94) g (cid:38) ) (cid:38) T 9 (cid:53) 0 . 04 (cid:35) , while the spread ( sd (cid:53) 0 . 12 ) in the (cid:94) g (cid:38) IE distribution is due to ran - dom errors (cid:64) (cid:94) ( (cid:68) (cid:94) g (cid:38) ) (cid:38) IE24 (cid:53) 0 . 04 (cid:35) plus other factors : course - to - course variation in the systematic error , and course - to - course variation in the effectiveness of the pedagogy and / or implementation . B . Systematic error Aside from the previously mentioned controversy 11 , 12 over the interpretation of a high FCI score , criticism of FCI test - ing sometimes involves perceived difﬁculties such as (cid:126) 1 (cid:33) question ambiguities and isolated false positives (cid:126) right an - swers for the wrong reasons (cid:33) ; and uncontrolled variables in the testing conditions such as (cid:126) 2 (cid:33) teaching to the test and test - question leakage , (cid:126) 3 (cid:33) the fraction of course time spent on mechanics , (cid:126) 4 (cid:33) post - and pre - test motivation of students , and (cid:126) 5 (cid:33) the Hawthorne / John Henry effects . 47 For both IE and T courses , the inﬂuence of errors (cid:126) 2 (cid:33) – (cid:126) 5 (cid:33) would be expected to vary from course to course in a more or less random manner , resulting in a systematic - error ‘‘noise’’ in gain versus pretest plots containing data from many courses . Although the magnitude of this noise is difﬁcult to estimate , it contributes to the width of the (cid:94) g (cid:38) distributions speciﬁed in Eq . (cid:126) 2 (cid:33) . The analysis of random errors above suggests that the systematic - error noise and the course - to - course variations in the effectiveness of the pedagogy and / or implementation contribute more importantly to the width of the (cid:94) g (cid:38) IE distribution than to the width of the (cid:94) g (cid:38) T distribu - tion . It is , of course , possible that the systematic errors , even though varying from course - to - course , could , on average , positively bias the IE gains so as to increase the difference (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) IE48 (cid:50) (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) T 14 . I consider below each of the above - indicated systematic errors . 1 . Question ambiguities and isolated false positives The use of a revised version 9 (cid:126) b (cid:33) of the FCI with fewer ambiguities and a smaller likelihood of false positives has had little impact 17 (cid:126) a (cid:33) on (cid:94) g (cid:38) IE as measured at Indiana and Harvard Universities . In addition , (cid:126) a (cid:33) interview data 9 (cid:126) a (cid:33) , 12 (cid:126) a (cid:33) suggest that ambiguities and false positives are relatively rare , (cid:126) b (cid:33) these errors would be expected to bias the IE and T courses about equally and therefore have little inﬂuence on the difference (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) 48IE (cid:50) (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) 14 T . 2 . Teaching to the test and test - question leakage Considering the elemental nature of the FCI questions , for IE courses both the average (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) 48IE (cid:53) 0 . 48 (cid:54) 0 . 14 , and maximum (cid:94) g (cid:38) (cid:53) 0 . 69 are disappointingly low , and below those which might be expected if teaching to the test or test - question leakage 48 were important inﬂuences . Of the 48 data sets 17 (cid:126) a (cid:33) for IE courses (cid:126) a (cid:33) 27 were supplied by respondents to our requests for data , of which 22 (cid:126) 81 % (cid:33) were accompanied by a completed survey questionnaire , (cid:126) b (cid:33) 13 have been discussed in the literature , and (cid:126) c (cid:33) 5 are Indiana University courses of which I have ﬁrst - hand knowledge . All survey - form respondents indicated that they thought they had avoided ‘‘teaching to the test’’ in answering the question ‘‘To what extent do you think you were able to avoid ‘teach - ing to the test (cid:126) s (cid:33) ’ (cid:126) i . e . , going over experiments , questions , or problems identical or nearly identical to the test items (cid:33) ? ’’ Likewise , published reports of the courses in group (cid:126) b (cid:33) and my own knowledge of courses in group (cid:126) c (cid:33) suggests an ab - sence of ‘‘teaching to the test’’ in the restricted sense indi - cated in the question . (cid:126) In the broadest sense , IE courses all ‘‘teach to the test’’ to some extent if this means teaching so as to give students some understanding of the basic concepts of Newtonian mechanics as examined on the FCI / MD tests . However , this is the bias we are attempting to measure . (cid:33) There has been no evidence of test - question leakage in the Indiana post - test results (cid:126) e . g . , signiﬁcant mismatches for in - dividual students between FCI scores and other course grades (cid:33) . So far there has been only one report 9 (cid:126) a (cid:33) of such leakage in the literature—as indicated in Ref . 17 (cid:126) a (cid:33) , the sus - pect data were excised from the survey . 3 . Fraction of course time spent on mechanics Comparisons can be made for T and IE courses within the same institution where the fraction f (cid:53) t m / t s of class time t m spent on mechanics (cid:126) including energy and momentum con - servation (cid:33) to the total semester (cid:126) or semester - equivalent (cid:33) time t s is about the same : Arizona State ( f (cid:53) 0 . 8 ) : (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) IE2 (cid:50) (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) T 3 (cid:53) 0 . 47 (cid:50) 0 . 24 (cid:53) 0 . 23 ; Cal Poly ( f (cid:53) 1 . 0 ) : (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) IE3 (cid:50) (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) T 1 (cid:53) 0 . 56 (cid:50) 0 . 25 (cid:53) 0 . 31 ; Harvard ( f (cid:53) 0 . 6 ) : (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) IE4 (cid:50) (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) T 1 (cid:53) 0 . 56 (cid:50) 0 . 27 (cid:53) 0 . 29 ; Monroe Com . Coll . (cid:126) MCC (cid:33) , noncalc . ( f (cid:53) 0 . 8 ) : (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) IE4 (cid:50) (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) T 1 (cid:53) 0 . 55 (cid:50) 0 . 22 (cid:53) 0 . 33 ; MCC calculus ( f (cid:53) 1 . 0 ) : (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) IE4 (cid:50) (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) T 1 (cid:53) 0 . 47 (cid:50) 0 . 22 (cid:53) 0 . 25 ; and Ohio State ( f (cid:53) 0 . 7 ) : (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) IE1 (cid:50) (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) T 1 (cid:53) 0 . 42 (cid:50) 0 . 18 (cid:53) 0 . 24 . Thus a substantial difference (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) IE (cid:50) (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) T is maintained where the time factor is equal . That the gain difference is not very sensitive to the frac - tion of the course time spent on mechanics over the range common in introductory courses can also be seen from the fact that the differences quoted above are rather similar to (cid:126) a (cid:33) one another despite the differences in f , and (cid:126) b (cid:33) the differ - ence (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) IE48 (cid:50) (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) T 14 (cid:53) 0 . 25 which characterizes the en - tire survey , despite the fact that f varies among the survey courses . Questionnaire responses covering 22 of the survey courses indicated that f ranged from 0 . 7 to 1 . 0 with an av - erage of 0 . 9 (cid:54) 0 . 1sd . 4 . Post - and pre - test motivation of students As indicated in 2 above , of the 48 data sets 17 (cid:126) a (cid:33) for IE courses , 27 were supplied by respondents to our requests for data , of which 22 were accompanied by a completed survey questionnaire . Responses to the question ‘‘Did the FCI post - test count as part of the ﬁnal grade in your course ? If so give the approximate weighting factor’’ were : ‘‘No’’ (cid:126) 50 % of the 22 courses surveyed (cid:33) ; ‘‘Not usually’’ (cid:126) 9 % (cid:33) ; ‘‘Yes , about 5 % ’’ (cid:126) 23 % (cid:33) ; ‘‘Yes , weighting factor under 10 % ’’ (cid:126) 9 % (cid:33) ; No Response , 9 % . For the 11 courses for which no grade incen - 69 69 Am . J . Phys . , Vol . 66 , No . 1 , January 1998 Richard R . Hake tives were offered , (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) IE11 (cid:53) 0 . 49 (cid:54) 0 . 10sd , close to the av - erage (cid:94) g (cid:38) for all the 48 IE courses of the survey (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) IE48 (cid:53) 0 . 48 (cid:54) 0 . 14sd . Thus it seems doubtful that post - test grade - incentive motivation is a signiﬁcant factor in determining the normalized gain . As for the pre - test , grade credit is , of course , inappropriate but (cid:94) g (cid:38) can be artiﬁcially raised if students are not induced 49 to take the pre - test seriously . All surveyed instructors an - swered ‘‘Yes’’ to the survey form question ‘‘Do you think that your students exerted serious effort on the FCI pre - test ? ’’ Likewise , published reports of the courses not sur - veyed and my own knowledge of courses at Indiana suggests that students did take the pre - test seriously . 5 . Hawthorne / John Henry effects ( Ref . 47 ) These effects can produce short - term beneﬁts associated with (cid:126) a (cid:33) the special attention (cid:126) rather than the intrinsic worth of the treatment (cid:33) given to a research test group (cid:126) Hawthorne effect (cid:33) , or (cid:126) b (cid:33) the desire of a control group to exceed the performance of a competing test group (cid:126) John Henry effect (cid:33) . Such beneﬁts would be expected to diminish when the treat - ment is applied as a regular long - term routine to large num - bers of subjects . Among IE courses , Hawthorne effects should be relatively small for courses where IE methods have been employed for many years in regular instruction for hundreds of students : ﬁve 1994 – 5 courses at Monroe Com - munity College 27 ( N (cid:53) 169 ) ; four 1993 – 5 courses at Indiana University 30 , 34 ( N (cid:53) 917 ) ; and three 1993 – 5 courses at Harvard 29 ( N (cid:53) 560 ) . For these 12 courses (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) IE12 (cid:53) 0 . 54 (cid:54) 0 . 10sd , about the same as the (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) IE29 (cid:53) 0 . 51 (cid:54) 0 . 10sd av - erage of the 29 IE courses (cid:126) excluding the 7 atypical Low - g courses (cid:33) for which , on average , Hawthorne effects were more likely to have occurred . Students may well beneﬁt from the special attention paid to them in regular IE instruction over the long term , but this beneﬁt is intrinsic to the peda - gogy and should not be classed as a Hawthorne effect . I shall not consider John Henry effects because any correction for them would only decrease (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) T 14 , and thus increase the difference (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) 48IE (cid:50) (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) 14 T . Although no reliable quantitative estimate of the inﬂuence of systematic errors seems possible under the present survey conditions , arguments in (cid:126) 1 (cid:33) – (cid:126) 5 (cid:33) above , and the general uni - formity of the survey results , suggest that it is extremely unlikely that systematic error plays a signiﬁcant role in the nearly two - standard - deviation difference observed in the av - erage normalized gains of T and IE courses shown in Eq . (cid:126) 2c (cid:33) and in Fig . 1 . Thus we conclude that this difference primarily reﬂects variation in the effectiveness of the peda - gogy and / or implementation . VI . IMPACT OF PHYSICS - EDUCATION RESEARCH All interactive - engagement methods used in the survey courses were stimulated in one way or another by physics - education research (cid:126) PER (cid:33) 51 , 52 and cognitive science . 44 , 53 It is signiﬁcant that of the 12 IE courses 9 (cid:126) a (cid:33) , (cid:126) c (cid:33) , 21 ; 27 ; 29 ; 30 (cid:126) b (cid:33) , (cid:126) c (cid:33) , (cid:126) d (cid:33) , 54 – 56 that achieved normalized gains g (cid:62) 0 . 60 (cid:126) see Figs . 1 and 3 (cid:33) , 67 % were taught at least in part by individuals who had devoted considerable attention to PER as judged by their publication of peer - reviewed articles or books on that subject (cid:64) the same can be said for 48 % of the 36 IE courses with ( (cid:94) g (cid:38) ) (cid:44) 0 . 6 (cid:35) . It is also noteworthy that of the 12 IE courses with g (cid:62) 0 . 60 , 42 % utilized texts 27a , 52b , 54 , 55 based on PER (cid:64) the same can be said for 19 % of the 36 IE courses with ( (cid:94) g (cid:38) ) (cid:44) 0 . 6 (cid:35) . It would thus appear that PER has produced very positive results in the classroom . For the 48 interactive - engagement courses of Fig . 1 , the ranking in terms of number of IE courses using each of the more popular methods is—Collaborative Peer Instruction (cid:126) CPI (cid:33) : 31 , 32 48 (cid:126) all courses (cid:33) ; Microcomputer - Based Labs (cid:126) MBL (cid:33) : 57 35 ; Concept Tests : 29 20 ; Modeling : 14 , 58 19 ; Active Learning Problem Sets (cid:126) ALPS (cid:33) 28 (cid:126) b (cid:33) or Overview Case Stud - ies (cid:126) OCS (cid:33) : 28 (cid:126) b (cid:33) 17 ; physics - education - research based text or no text : 13 ; and Socratic Dialogue Inducing (cid:126) SDI (cid:33) Labs : 8 , 13 , 34 9 . (cid:64) For simplicity , courses combined 17 (cid:126) a (cid:33) into one ‘‘course’’ (cid:64) TO (cid:126) 8 courses (cid:33) , TO - C (cid:126) 5 courses (cid:33) , and IUpre93 (cid:126) 5 courses (cid:33) are counted as one course each . (cid:35) The ranking in terms of number of students using each method is—CPI : 4458 (cid:126) all students (cid:33) ; MBL : 2704 ; Concept Tests : 2479 ; SDI : 1705 ; OCS / ALPS : 1101 ; Modeling : 885 ; research - based text or no text : 660 . A detailed breakdown of the instructional strategies as well as materials and their sources for each of the 48 IE courses of this survey is presented in a companion article . 17 (cid:126) a (cid:33) The IE methods are usually interdependent and can be melded together to enhance one another’s strengths and modiﬁed to suit local conditions and preferences (cid:126) especially easy if materials are available electronically 27 (cid:126) a (cid:33) , 29 (cid:126) c (cid:33) , 34 (cid:126) c (cid:33) so as to facilitate copying , pasting , and cutting (cid:33) . All these IE strat - egies , having proven themselves to be relatively effective in large - scale pre / post - testing , deserve serious consideration by physics teachers who wish to improve their courses , by physics - education researchers , and by designers of new in - troductory physics courses . 58 (cid:126) c (cid:33) , 59 VII . SUGGESTIONS FOR COURSE AND SURVEY IMPROVEMENTS Although the 48 interactive engagement courses of Figs . 1 – 3 appear , on average , to be much more effective than traditional courses , none is in the High - g region and some are even in the Low - g region characteristic of traditional courses . This is especially disturbing considering the el - emental and basic nature of the Force Concept Inventory and Mechanics Diagnostic test questions . (cid:126) Many instructors refuse to place such questions on their exams , thinking that they are ‘‘too simple . ’’ 18 (cid:33) As indicated above , case studies 17 (cid:126) a (cid:33) of the Low - g IE courses strongly suggest the presence of implementation problems . Similar detailed stud - ies for Medium - g IE courses were not carried out , but per - sonal experience with the Indiana courses and communica - tions with most of the IE instructors in this study suggest that similar though less severe implementation problems (cid:126) Sec . III A (cid:33) were common . Thus there appear to be no magic bullets among the IE treatments of this survey and more work seems to be re - quired on both their content and implementation . As argued more trenchantly in Ref . 17 (cid:126) a (cid:33) , this survey and other work suggests that improvements may occur through , e . g . , (cid:126) a (cid:33) use of IE methods in all components of a course and tight inte - gration of all those components ; 60 (cid:126) b (cid:33) careful attention to motivational factors and the provision of grade incentives for taking IE activities seriously ; (cid:126) c (cid:33) administration of exams in which a substantial number of the questions probe the degree of conceptual understanding induced by the IE methods ; (cid:126) d (cid:33) inexpensive augmentation of the teaching / coaching staff by undergraduate and postdoctoral students ; 34 (cid:126) b (cid:33) , 61 (cid:126) e (cid:33) appren - 70 70 Am .

More generally , a redesign process (cid:126) described by Wilson and Daviss 66 and undertaken in Refs . 34 and 67 (cid:33) of continuous long - term classroom use , feedback , assessment , research analysis , and revision seems to be required for substantive educational reform . Standards and measurement are badly needed in physics education 68 and are vital components of the redesign process . In my view , the present survey is a step in the right direction but improvements in future assessments might be achieved through (cid:126) in approximate order of ease of implementation (cid:33) (cid:126) 1 (cid:33) standardization of test - administration practices ; 48 , 49 (cid:126) 2 (cid:33) use of a survey questionnaire 15 (cid:126) c (cid:33) reﬁned and sharpened in light of the present experience ; (cid:126) 3 (cid:33) more widespread use of stan - dardized tests 9 (cid:126) b (cid:33) , 10 ; 50 (cid:126) a (cid:33) – (cid:126) c (cid:33) , 57 (cid:126) c (cid:33) by individual instructors so as to monitor the learning of their students ; (cid:126) 4 (cid:33) observation and analysis of classroom activities by independent evalua - tors ; 59 (cid:126) a (cid:33) (cid:126) 5 (cid:33) solicitation of anonymous information from a large random sample of physics teachers ; (cid:126) 6 (cid:33) development and use of new and improved versions of the FCI and MB tests , treated with the conﬁdentiality of the MCAT , 48 (cid:126) 7 (cid:33) use of E & M concept tests , 69 and questionnaires which assess stu - dent views on science and learning ; 63 and (cid:126) 8 (cid:33) reduction of possible teaching - to - the - test inﬂuence by drawing test ques - tions from pools such that the speciﬁc questions are un - known to the instructor . 68 VIII . SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION Fourteen traditional ( T ) courses ( N (cid:53) 2084 ) which made little or no use of interactive - engagement (cid:126) IE (cid:33) methods achieved an average gain (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) 14 T (cid:53) 0 . 23 (cid:54) 0 . 04 . In sharp contrast , 48 IE courses ( N (cid:53) 4458 ) which made substantial use of IE methods achieved an average gain (cid:94)(cid:94) g (cid:38)(cid:38) 48IE (cid:53) 0 . 48 (cid:54) 0 . 14 . It is extremely unlikely that systematic errors play a signiﬁcant role in the nearly two - standard - deviation difference in the normalized gains of the T and IE courses . A plot of average course scores on the Hestenes / Wells problem - solving Mechanics Baseline test versus those on the conceptual Force Concept Inventory show a strong positive correlation with coefﬁcient r (cid:53)(cid:49) 0 . 91 . Comparison of IE and traditional courses implies that IE methods enhance problem - solving ability . The conceptual and problem - solving test results strongly suggest that the use of IE strategies can increase mechanics - course effectiveness well beyond that obtained with tradi - tional methods . EPILOGUE This survey indicates that the strenuous recent efforts to reform introductory physics instruction , enlightened by cog - nitive science and research in physics education , have shown very positive results in the classroom . However , history 70 – 75 suggests the possibility that such efforts may have little last - ing impact . This would be most unfortunate , considering the current imperative to (cid:126) a (cid:33) educate more effective science majors 76 and science - trained professionals , 77 and (cid:126) b (cid:33) raise the appallingly low level of science literacy 78 , 79 among the general population . Progress toward these goals should in - crease our chances of solving the monumental science - intensive problems 80 – 86 (cid:126) economic , social , political , and en - vironmental (cid:33) that beset us , but major upgrading of physics education on a national scale will probably require (cid:126) 1 (cid:33) the cooperation of instructors , departments , institutions , and pro - fessional organizations , 87 (cid:126) 2 (cid:33) long - term classroom use , feed - back , assessment , research analysis , and redesign of interactive - engagement methods . 66 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work received partial support from NSF Grant No .

These points can be explained in terms of unusual course features : Van Heuvelen’s methods are oriented toward problem solving , while Altman’s classes contain a relatively high percentage (cid:126) about 30 % (cid:33) of non - native 72 72 Am . J . Phys . , Vol . 66 , No . 1 , January 1998 Richard R . Hake English speakers whose scores on the FCI may be artiﬁcially lowered by language difﬁculties . That the other UML93 - C point is close to the least - squares ﬁt line can be accounted for by the fact that in 1993 (cid:126) unlike in 1994 (cid:33) no grade credit was given for performance on the MB exam , even though the MB exam requires the ‘‘intolerable labor of thought’’ to a much greater extent than the FCI . (cid:126) Grade credit was given at UML in 1993 and 1994 for performance on the FCI post - test . (cid:33) 43 B . Thacker , E . Kim , K . Trefz , and S . M .

Kirkup , Experimental Methods (cid:126) Wiley , New York , 1994 (cid:33) , especially pp . 85 – 87 . These conventional methods are not strictly applicable because the pre - and post - test score distributions tend to depart from Gaussians— our experience is that FCI post - test scores are usually negatively skewed (cid:126) ceiling effect (cid:33) . 46 For simplicity let (cid:94) S f (cid:38) (cid:91) x and (cid:94) S i (cid:38) (cid:91) y , so that Eq . (cid:126) 1 (cid:33) becomes (cid:94) g (cid:38) (cid:53) ( x (cid:50) y ) / ( C (cid:50) y ) where C is the number of questions on the exam and x and y are the average number of correct responses on the post - and pre - tests . The conventional treatment (cid:126) e . g . , Ref . 45 (cid:33) regards the random error (cid:68) x to be the ‘‘standard deviation of the mean . ’’ This is just the sd x divided by the square root of the number of measurements N . Thus (cid:68) x (cid:53) sd x / N 1 / 2 and (cid:68) y (cid:53) sd y / N 1 / 2 . If one thinks of measuring x a , x b , x c , . . . , x n for many sets n (cid:126) say 10 6 (cid:33) of N students (cid:126) all drawn randomly from the same enormous hypothetical homogeneous population (cid:33) and then taking the average of x a , x b , x c , . . . , x n to deﬁne the ‘‘true’’ value x (cid:126) true (cid:33) of x , then one can be 68 % conﬁdent that x a lies within (cid:54) (cid:68) x of x (cid:126) true (cid:33) . With this deﬁnition of (cid:68) x (cid:126) and similarly for (cid:68) y (cid:33) , the conventional treatment then speciﬁes (cid:68) (cid:94) g (cid:38) (cid:53) (cid:36) (cid:64) ( (cid:93) (cid:94) g (cid:38) / (cid:93) x ) (cid:68) x ) (cid:35) 2 (cid:49) (cid:64) ( (cid:93) (cid:94) g (cid:38) / (cid:93) y ) (cid:68) y ) ] 2 (cid:37) 1 / 2 . Here (cid:93) (cid:94) g (cid:38) / (cid:93) x (cid:53) 1 / ( C (cid:50) y ) and (cid:93) (cid:94) g (cid:38) / (cid:93) y (cid:53) ( x (cid:50) C ) / ( C (cid:50) y ) 2 . All this assumes that the separate errors associated with x and y are random and independent , and are small enough that they may be treated as differentials . For the presently analyzed data , the average , minimum , and maximum of : (cid:68) x (cid:53) 2 . 0 % , 0 . 6 % , and 3 . 5 % of C ; (cid:68) y (cid:53) 2 . 0 % , 0 . 4 % , and 3 . 8 % of C . As suggested by R . E . Mills , somewhat lower random errors are entailed if one takes the average g for a course to be g ( ave ) (cid:91) ( 1 / N ) (cid:83) j g j (cid:53) ( 1 / N ) (cid:83) j ( post j (cid:50) pre j ) / ( C (cid:50) pre j ) . In practice , for N (cid:62) 20 , g (cid:126) ave (cid:33) is usually within 5 % of (cid:94) g (cid:38) . Equa - tion (cid:126) 1 (cid:33) and the above deﬁnition of g (cid:126) ave (cid:33) imply that (cid:64) g ( ave ) (cid:50) (cid:94) g (cid:38) (cid:35) is proportional to the g j - weighted average of the deviations ( pre j (cid:50) (cid:94) pre j (cid:38) ) . Since the average of ( pre j (cid:50) (cid:94) pre j (cid:38) ) is zero , a low (cid:64) g ( ave ) (cid:50) (cid:94) g (cid:38) (cid:35) implies a low correlation between g j and pre j (cid:91) ( S i ) j for individual students , just as there is a low correlation between (cid:94) g (cid:38) and (cid:94) S i (cid:38) for courses , as discussed just above Eq . (cid:126) 2c (cid:33) . 47 See , e . g . , R . E . Slavin , Research Methods in Education (cid:126) Allyn and Bacon , Boston , 1992 (cid:33) , 2nd ed . 48 It is unfortunate that the national - assessment value of arduously con - structed and validated standardized tests such as the FCI and the MB is gradually being eroded by distribution of answers to students at some institutions . The danger of question leakage is especially severe if the post - test FCI / MB scores are used to determine part of the ﬁnal course grade . At Indiana , the FCI test is always given and referred to as a ‘‘di - agnostic mechanics exam’’ in an attempt to shield Ref . 9 (cid:126) a (cid:33) . We collect all pre - and post - tests from students and none is returned . The pre - and post - tests scores are posted by ID , but questions and answers are neither posted , disseminated , nor shown as computer animations . After the post - test , in - structors are quite willing to discuss FCI / MB questions privately with any student , but answer keys are not posted . Because there are many sources (cid:64) Ref . 17 (cid:126) a (cid:33)(cid:35) of good conceptual questions , there is little need to draw on the standardized tests for questions to be used for ordinary class discussion and testing . Indiana students understand that the FCI must be treated just as the MCAT , and there is little dissatisfaction . Because of the above - mentioned dispersal of answers at some institutions , and the fact that the FCI and MB tests were published in the open literature , their useful lives may not extend for more than another year . New and better tests (cid:126) treated with the conﬁdentially of the MCAT (cid:33) are sorely needed in time for a calibration against the original or revised FCI . The necessary steps in the laborious process of constructing valid and reliable multiple - choice phys - ics tests have been discussed in Refs . 1 (cid:126) a (cid:33) , 9 (cid:126) a (cid:33) , and 50 . 49 At Arizona (cid:64) Ref . 1 (cid:126) a (cid:33)(cid:35) and Indiana (cid:126) Ref . 8 (cid:33) it is explained to students that their scores on the pre - test will not count toward the course grade but will be conﬁdentially returned to them and will assist both themselves and their instructors to know the degree and type of effort required for them to understand mechanics . 50 (cid:126) a (cid:33) R .

Undergraduates have the further ad - vantage that they are relatively inexpensive to employ . Post - doctoral stu - dents have also volunteered to serve as lab instructors , since they are often motivated to seek experience with advanced educational methods in order to better qualify themselves for job opportunities in the expanding market for educationally effective teachers .
