Published on Explorable . com ( https : / / explorable . com ) Inferential Statistics Inferential statistics , unlike descriptive statistics [ 1 ] , is the attempt to apply the conclusions that have been obtained from one experimental study to more general populations . This means inferential statistics tries to answer questions about populations and samples that have not been tested in the given experiment . If you conduct a survey [ 2 ] , the goal is to apply the conclusions to a more general population , assuming the sample size [ 3 ] is large enough and the sample representative enough of the broader public . This is important because studies and experiments need to state and conclude something about general populations and not just about the sample that was studied . For example , suppose there is a training program that claims to improve test scores and an experimenter wants to verify the claims . She starts with two groups , one taking the training program and the other not ( the control [ 4 ] ) . She measures the test scores in the beginning and at the end , making sure that the starting test scores are , on an average , the same for both test groups . The researcher finds that the test scores for those who take the training are indeed higher now , and this difference is statistically significant [ 5 ] . She rejects her null hypothesis . Merely stating the results for the two groups in terms of average score difference and representing this in the form of graphs is descriptive statistics [ 1 ] . But if she concludes that the training program is effective in improving test scores ( in general , and for all people ) , then this is inferential statistics . It ' s tempting to assume that descriptive statistics alone signals the end of an experiment , or to fail to draw a distinction between the results of descriptive statistical tests and your analysis . Statistics are powerful tools , but it ' s the analysis provided afterwards by inferential statistics that explicitly makes claims about what those results mean , why , and in what context . Remember that inference involves moving focus from smaller and more specific to larger and more general . It should be noted that inferential statistics [ 6 ] always talks in terms of probability [ 7 ] , but this can be made highly reliable by designing the right experimental conditions . The inferences are almost always an estimate with a confidence interval [ 8 ] . There are however some cases where there is simply a rejection of a hypothesis [ 9 ] that is involved , which is the case if the experiment is designed [ 10 ] to refute some claim . Several models are available in inferential statistics that help in the process of analysis . These models need to be chosen with care , since an error in assuming one model might give faulty conclusions about the experiment . For example data might be assumed to be described by a probability density with some variables [ 11 ] that need to be determined in the experiment . However , there are some cases when such an assumption cannot be made , which usually occurs during experiments involving sampling of a human population in social science experiments . Therefore one needs to take all precautions in order to arrive at the right conclusions through inferential statistics .
