The ability of cells to sense and respond to these mechanical cues is critical for numer - ous biological processes , including embryogenesis 4 , 5 , development 4 , 5 and tissue homeostasis 6 , 7 . Although it has long been recognized that mechanical forces can influence cell morphology and behaviour 8 , 9 , the understanding of the molecular pathways involved in mecha - nosensing , and how disruption of these pathways can give rise to various diseases , is still in progress 10 – 13 . Stretch - activated ion chan - nels , adhesion complexes , cell – cell junctions and cytoskeletal com - ponents have all been identified as mechanosensitive elements that can activate cellular signalling pathways , such Rho - family GTPases or the mitogen - activated protein kinase – extracellular signal - reg - ulated kinase ( MAPK – ERK ) , induce nuclear translocation of the transcriptional regulators YAP / TAZ and MKL1 , and ultimately result in expression of mechanoresponsive genes ( see refs 14 – 18 for review ) . Over the last two decades , the question whether the nucleus itself can sense mechanical stimuli has received increasing attention 19 , 20 . Such ‘nuclear mechanotransduction’ could provide a more rapid and direct method to transduce forces into cellular events 21 , 22 and act in concert with or independent of cytoplasmic mechanotransduction pathways . In this scenario , forces applied to the nucleus through the cytoskeleton may modulate the effect of cytoplasmic signals or even be sufficient to directly trigger changes in gene expression . Such multi - faceted mechanotransduction may enable cells to distinguish between small forces that only affect the cell surface , and larger forces that result in large - scale deformations of the cell and nucleus . Encouraged in part by advances in biophysi - cal , biochemical and imaging assays , multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain how forces acting on the nucleus could influence chromatin organization , transcription and other cellular processes 19 , 22 – 24 . However , distinguishing between nuclear events that are downstream of cytoplasmic mechanosensitive signalling pathways , and those that reflect true nuclear mechanotransduction events , remains challenging . One aspect , which is commonly accepted now , is that extra - cellular and cytoplasmic forces are transmitted across the nuclear envelope to the nuclear interior , where they can cause deformation of chromatin and nuclear bodies 20 , 25 – 27 . Intriguingly , a recent study has demonstrated that force application to the nucleus can induce chromatin stretching and expression of a reporter transgene 28 . These findings provide some of the most direct evidence to date for the nucleus as a mechanoresponsive organelle . Below we dis - cuss current findings that support nuclear mechanotransduction , explain potential molecular mechanisms and highlight emerging technologies to study nuclear mechanotransduction . The nucleus and the nuclear lamina The nucleus is the largest and stiffest organelle in the cell 29 , 30 . It can broadly be separated into the nuclear interior ( which contains chromatin ) , nuclear bodies and other intranuclear elements , and the surrounding nuclear envelope . The nuclear envelope con - sists of the outer and inner nuclear membranes ( ONM and INM , respectively ) , which contain a large number of membrane - bound proteins 31 , 32 , as well as nuclear pore complexes ( NPCs ) that control entry of large molecules into the nuclear interior 33 . Underneath the INM lies the nuclear lamina , a filamentous protein network that consists of A - type and B - type lamins , and lamin - binding proteins 34 , 35 . In mammalian somatic cells , the major A - type lamin isoforms are lamin A and C , encoded by the LMNA gene . One major reason to study the role of the nucleus in mechanotrans - duction came from the identification of LMNA mutations as the genetic cause for various forms of muscular dystrophy and car - diomyopathy 36 – 38 . Diseases caused by lamin mutations ( commonly referred to as laminopathies ) remain both intriguing and perplex - ing . Although A - type lamins are nearly ubiquitously expressed , many of the LMNA mutations predominantly affect mechanically active tissue , such as skeletal muscle , cardiac muscle and tendons . These tissue - specific disease phenotypes suggest that defects in the nucleus can impair the ability of cells to respond appropriately to mechanical forces . It is now well - recognized that the nuclear lam - ina governs numerous biological functions , both biophysical and biochemical , including determining nuclear size and stiffness 39 – 43 , regulating translocation and activity of transcription factors 44 – 47 , interacting with chromatin and regulating its epigenetic state 48 , 49 , and controlling cell polarization and migration 50 – 52 . Consequently , cells lacking lamin A / C or expressing lamin A / C mutations linked to human diseases display severe defects in nuclear stability 53 – 55 , cytoskeletal dynamics 47 , 51 and nucleo - cytoskeletal force transmis - sion 55 , 56 . Furthermore , lamin - A / C - deficient and - mutant cells fail to adequately activate mechanoresponsive genes when subjected to mechanical stimulation 43 , 57 , 58 , suggesting an important role of the nucleus , and lamin A / C in particular , in cellular mechano - transduction . However , it remains incompletely understood to what extent lamins directly respond to mechanical stress in vivo , Emerging views of the nucleus as a cellular mechanosensor Tyler J . Kirby 1 , 2 and Jan Lammerding 1 , 2 * The ability of cells to respond to mechanical forces is critical for numerous biological processes .

NaTurE CELL BioLogy | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology SERIES | Review ARticle NaTurE CEll Biology and whether changes in lamin levels and organization are down - stream of other mechanotransduction pathways 26 , 59 – 61 . The impor - tance of the nuclear lamina in fundamental biological processes is highlighted by the early death of mice that lack functional lamin A / C . These mice are born without any overt defects , but develop severe muscular dystrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy and die at 2 – 8 weeks of age 62 , 63 . Uncovering how lamins mediate nuclear processes and mechanosensitive gene expression will not only enhance our understanding of mechanotransduction per se , but may also provide insights into the pathophysiology of laminopa - thies , with the potential to inform therapeutic approaches for these currently incurable diseases . Force transmission to the nucleus Work by the Ingber group in the 1990s provided some of the first evidence that forces can be transmitted from the cell surface to the nucleus through the cytoskeleton 20 . It is now recognized that these forces are transmitted across the nuclear envelope through the ‘linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton’ ( LINC ) complex 64 , 65 . The LINC complex consists of nesprin proteins that reside within the ONM and contain a C - terminal KASH ( Klarsicht , ANC - 1 , Syne homol - ogy ) domain , which interacts with SUN ( Sad1 Unc - 84 ) domain - containing proteins located on the INM . The SUN proteins in turn bind to the nuclear lamina , nuclear pores and chromatin 66 ( Fig . 1a ) . On the cytoplasmic side , nesprins can interact with each other and with all major cytoskeletal filaments . The composition of the LINC complex and LINC complex - associated proteins varies depending on the cell type . Furthermore , both nesprin - 1 and nesprin - 2 contain alternative start and stop sites that produce a number of isoforms , including the so - called ‘giant’ variants , which contain an N - terminal actin - binding domain 67 . Nesprin - 1 and nesprin - 2 can bind to actin filaments 67 and the microtubule - associated motor proteins kine - sin 68 and dynein 69 , nesprin - 3 binds to plectin 70 , which connects to intermediate filaments , whereas nesprin - 4 interacts with kinesin - 1 71 ( Fig . 1a ) . Additional KASH - domain - containing proteins and LINC complex - associated proteins have recently been characterized and are often cell - type - specific . We refer the readers to recent reviews on the LINC complex for further details 34 , 66 , 67 , 72 . Whereas external forces can be applied to the nucleus indepen - dently of the LINC complex , for example , during compression of the nucleus 73 or cell migration through confined environments 74 , cells in many cases require an intact LINC complex to effectively trans - mit forces between the cytoskeleton and the nucleus . Consequently , depletion or expression of dominant - negative nesprin or SUN pro - teins severely impairs nucleo - cytoskeletal force transmission 27 and mechanosensitive gene expression 28 , 75 . Nonetheless , it remains to be tested whether impaired mechanotransduction is due to the role of components of the LINC complex in intracellular force transmis - sion , or whether these proteins contribute through other functions , such as serving as signalling scaffolds or regulating other aspects of nuclear organization including chromatin mobility and nuclear envelope tethering 49 , 76 . Force - induced nuclear deformation further requires an intact and adequately tensed cytoskeletal network 77 , 78 to transmit forces from the cell surface to the nucleus 22 . If the actin cytoskeleton is disrupted through pharmacological or genetic approaches , force transmission to the nucleus is impaired 78 , 79 , which is accompanied by changes in chromatin dynamics 77 . Notably , mechanically induced changes in the nucleus , cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix appear to be interrelated . For example , the mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix affect both cyto - skeletal organization 80 and expression of lamin A / C 61 , 81 , resulting in cells that are finely tuned to their physical environment . The intricate relationship between the cytoskeletal network , nuclear mechanics and the mechanical environment is particu - larly important for skeletal and cardiac muscle cells . These con - tractile cells have a highly organized cytoskeleton , including a specialized perinuclear network that anchors the nucleus in place ( Fig . 1b ) . Desmin is a muscle - specific cytoplasmic intermediate fil - ament that interacts with the nuclear envelope through plectin 1 82 . This interaction is important for myofibre health 83 and func - tional loss of plectin releases tension on the nucleus resulting in altered expression of mechanoresponsive genes 82 . LINC - complex proteins have similarly important functions in muscle cells . The LINC complex is required for myonuclear movement 84 – 87 , includ - ing the effective spacing of nuclei along the myofibre length . Loss of LINC - complex function causes muscular dystrophies 88 – 90 , sug - gesting that adequately connecting the nucleus to the cytoskeleton is crucial for skeletal muscle health and maintenance . This idea is further supported by the finding that LMNA mutations that cause muscular dystrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy result in impaired nucleo - cytoskeletal coupling 55 , 91 , 92 and loss of structural function , whereas LMNA mutations associated with lipodystrophy have little or no effect on nuclear mechanics and nucleo - cytoskeletal force transmission 55 , 91 . a b Intermediatefilaments F - actin Microtubules NPC Nesprin - 1 / 2 Nesprin - 3 Lamin A / C Emerin Dynein Kinesin Sun 1 / 2 Plectin BAF LAP2 Sarcolemma Nucleus Dystrophin Dystroglycan complex Satellite cell Microtubules Myofibre Nesprin - 1 / 2 Nesprin - 4 Nesprin - 3 Nucleus Cytoplasm F - actin Desmin Desmin Basement membrane Nesprin - 4 Fig . 1 | Schematic overview of nuclear envelope proteins involved in force transmission to the nucleus . a , Force transmission to the nucleus involves interaction of cytoskeletal elements ( actin filaments , intermediate filaments , microtubules ) with nesprin proteins on the ONM that transmit force through SUN domain proteins on the INM to the nuclear lamina and interior . b , Organization of the cytoskeletal network within muscle cells , including the highly ordered actin – myosin structures that form contractile sarcomeres and myofibrils .

NaTurE CELL BioLogy | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology SERIES | Review ARticle NaTurE CEll Biology Although striated muscle tissues are affected the most by disrup - tion in nuclear mechanics and nucleo - cytoskeletal coupling , many other cell types are also affected by impaired nucleo - cytoskeletal force transmission 93 , 94 . For example , T cell activation requires lamin A / C and the LINC complex to function properly to regulate T cell receptor clustering and F - actin formation 93 . In fibroblasts and endo - thelial cells , depletion of lamin A / C or disruption of the LINC com - plex reduces migration capabilities 94 – 96 . Similarly , the LINC complex is important in outer hair cells for hearing 97 , proper function of the ciliary rootlets in photoreceptors and ependymal cells 98 , hair follicle structure 99 and radial neuronal migration during neurogenesis 100 . These findings demonstrate the broad importance of nucleo - cyto - skeletal force transmission on cellular function . Potential mechanisms for nuclear mechanotransduction The negative effects of lamin mutations and LINC complex dis - ruption are well - documented , but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood . External forces are transmitted across the cytoskeleton to the nucleus , where they result in substantial deformation 101 – 103 . These forces and deformations could modulate transcriptional activity and chromatin organization through a number of mechanisms . One potential mechanism to transduce forces acting on the nucleus into altered transcriptional activity is by modulating the physical organization of chromatin . The spatial location of the DNA within the nucleus exists in a non - random organization . This ‘4D nucleome’ ( meaning the 3D chromatin architecture and its change over time ) is important for transcriptional regulation and cellular functions 104 – 107 . Heterochromatic DNA , which is tightly wrapped around histones and largely inaccessible for the transcriptional machinery , is often localized at the nuclear periphery 49 . This periph - eral localization promotes gene silencing , whereas repositioning of genes towards the interior of the nucleus generally facilitates gene activation 108 , although additional regulatory networks exist . Thus , force - induced changes in gene positioning relative to the nuclear periphery could alter the transcriptional activity of specific genes and contribute to nuclear mechanotransduction . Supporting this idea , altering cytoskeletal organization and tension by culturing cells on micropatterned substrates alters nuclear shape and chromo - some distribution , accompanied by changes in gene expression 103 , 109 . It remains unclear to what extent these changes are the direct result of altered cytoskeletal forces acting on the nucleus versus upstream signalling pathways that may be sensitive to cytoskeletal organiza - tion . Extrinsic force application to cells can also induce reposition - ing of nuclear bodies and the associated chromatin 110 – 112 , which could affect additional nuclear processes . Lastly , whereas changes in chromatin organization may be downstream of forces acting on the nucleus , the epigenetic state of chromatin also contributes to the mechanical properties of the nucleus : chromatin decondensa - tion increases nuclear deformability and chromatin condensation decreases nuclear deformability 110 , 113 – 116 , both of which may occur independently of changes in lamin levels 117 . Thus , changes in nuclear organization , even when downstream of other pathways , can have a direct effect on nuclear deformation and may thus modulate other nuclear mechanotransduction processes . In addition to changes in gene or chromosome positioning , mechanical forces may directly alter chromatin organization and transcription . In vitro experiments indicate that 5 pN of force is suf - ficient to decondense single chromatin fibres 118 . Recent work from the Wang and Belmont laboratories demonstrated that applying force to the cell surface results in instantaneous stretching of chro - matin inside the nucleus , associated with rapid induction of tran - scription of a transgene that is located within the stretched region of chromatin 28 . Notably , the level of transcription correlated with the frequency and magnitude of the applied forces , and disruption of the LINC complex abolished the force - mediated transcription response 28 . The finding that force - induced transcription occurred extremely rapidly ( < 30 seconds ) suggests that the stretching of chromatin alters the accessibility of the transcriptional machinery to the gene or its activity , rather than altering the epigenetic state of the locus . Although highly intriguing , the directly mediated modu - lation of gene expression has not yet been demonstrated for endog - enous genes . Furthermore , it remains to be investigated whether this mechanism of modulating gene transcription only applies to genes that are already ‘primed’ for transcription , or if it could also activate silenced genes , such as those in heterochromatic regions . Notably , prolonged force application induces an increase in hetero - chromatin and transcriptional repression 4 , which could serve as a negative feedback mechanism . Lastly , it remains unclear how force - induced chromatin stretching would be able to confer specificity , as it is likely that multiple genomic loci are subjected to a similar level of mechanical force , and a direct association between mechanore - sponsive genes and components of the LINC complex has not been demonstrated to date . Force - induced molecular crowding could present another poten - tial nuclear mechanotransduction mechanism . Nuclear deformation could also alter nuclear processes by local crowding and exclusion of soluble factors in areas where chromatin has been compacted . For example , exclusion of DNA - damage repair factors delays repair of DNA breaks 119 , 120 . Similarly , exclusion of transcriptional regulators or chromatin remodelling proteins could alter transcriptional activity . Recent studies revealed that mechanical stress can induce con - formational and post - translational changes ( for example , phos - phorylation ) in nuclear envelope proteins 26 , 60 , 61 , 121 ( Fig . 2 ) . Force application on the nucleus results in apical - to - basal differences in the conformation of lamin A / C , as shown by the masking of cer - tain C - and N - terminal epitopes under tension 60 . Exposing isolated nuclei to shear stress exposes a cryptic cysteine residue ( Cys552 ) in the Ig - domain of lamin A / C , which is normally inaccessible dur - ing periods of low mechanical stress 61 . It remains to be investigated whether this residue becomes exposed under physiological forces in intact cells , as the N - terminal portion of the Ig - domain appears to be mostly inaccessible during periods of high mechanical stress in vivo 60 . Recent findings further indicate that reduced cytoskel - etal tension , for example when cells are cultured on soft substrates , results in increased lamin A / C phosphorylation , which is associated with increased solubility and degradation 61 , 121 . By contrast , increased cytoskeletal tension results in decreased lamin A / C phosphoryla - tion and higher lamin A / C levels 121 . Similarly , force application to isolated nuclei through the LINC complex causes phosphorylation of the INM protein emerin 26 , which binds to lamin AC . It is unclear whether these phosphorylation events are triggered by increased residue accessibility after force - induced conformational changes , or whether force application modulates the activity of nuclear kinases such as Src 122 . Regardless of the specific mechanism , mutating the relevant Tyr74 and Tyr95 sites in emerin leads to decreased stress - fibre formation and decreased expression of SRF - dependent genes 26 . In response to prolonged force application , emerin may also serve to reinforce the actin network at the ONM and facilitate chromatin remodelling 4 . Although additional work is needed to elucidate the specific pathways involved , including whether emerin and lamin are downstream of other mechanosensitive signalling events and which biochemical signals are activated by their phosphorylation , these findings demonstrate the relevance of nuclear envelope proteins for modulation of transcriptional activity as well as nuclear and cyto - skeletal organization . Force - induced stretching of nuclear membranes could pres - ent an additional mechanism for nuclear mechanotransduction . Hypotonic swelling of the nuclear membranes results in translocation of nucleoplasmic phospholipase A2 ( cPLA2 ) to the INM , which is inhibited when the nucleus is stabilized by either F - actin or lamin A / C 123 . This translocation directly activates cPLA2 and 5 - LOX 123 , © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature . All rights reserved . NaTurE CELL BioLogy | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology SERIES | Review ARticle NaTurE CEll Biology which are required for production of the chemotactic eicosanoids that attract leukocytes to sites of injury in vivo 123 . Because the under - lying nuclear lamina is substantially stiffer than the nuclear mem - branes , it mechanically shields the nuclear membranes from large forces . At the same time , the nuclear lamina can tolerate substan - tially larger area strains than lipid membranes 115 , 116 . Thus , nuclear envelope composition and organization could markedly modu - late the stretch response of the nuclear membrane . Furthermore , because the nuclear membranes are continuous with the endoplas - mic reticulum , stretching of the nuclear membrane is expected to increase the membrane tension in the adjacent rough endoplasmic reticulum 124 . It will be interesting to determine whether increased membrane tension on the nucleus can alter the organization of the rough endoplasmic reticulum , and possibly the distribution of membrane - bound proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum 125 . For example , polysomes are enriched in the sheets rather than tubules of the endoplasmic reticulum 126 , thus reducing membrane curvature could increase their exposure to the cytosol ( Fig . 2 ) . An extreme form of nuclear mechanotransduction is force - induced nuclear membrane rupture . Compressive forces on the nucleus generated by actomyosin contractility can increase intra - nuclear pressure and result in nuclear membrane blebbing and transient loss of nuclear envelope integrity ( that is , nuclear envelope rupture ) 79 , 127 – 130 . Although these phenomena were first observed in cells that were deficient in lamin A / C , carried lamin A / C muta - tions 91 or had lower levels of B - type lamins 79 , as well as in cancer cells with a compromised nuclear lamina 54 , it is now apparent that all cells regularly exhibit transient nuclear envelope rupture . Defects in the nuclear lamina , increased actomyosin contractility and external confinement can markedly increase the incidence of nuclear enve - lope rupture from a few per cent to the majority of cells 79 , 131 . Cells typically restore nuclear envelope integrity and remain viable , but loss of nuclear envelope integrity results in uncontrolled exchange of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins 91 , 128 , mislocalization of organ - elles 54 and DNA damage 128 , 129 . The effect of nuclear envelope rup - ture on cell signalling , chromatin organization , gene expression and long - term outcomes remain incompletely understood and are topics of active investigation . Transcriptome analysis of nuclear rupture induced by severe cell compression revealed activation of DNA - damage response pathways , metabolism and nucleolar RNA production 132 . Recent findings additionally point to an important function of cGAS , a cytoplasmic DNA - binding protein first recog - nized for its activation of the STING pathways when encounter - ing viral DNA in the cytoplasm 133 . The latest findings indicate that cGAS can also be activated when exposed to genomic DNA after nuclear envelope breakdown of micronuclei 134 – 137 . Increased nuclear membrane tension could also potentiate cytoplasmic signalling pathways by altering the permeability of NPCs ( Fig . 2 ) . Current models generated from the atomic struc - tures of NPC components suggest that the NPCs can undergo conformational changes that constrict or dilate the NPC in response to mechanical force 138 – 140 . Force - mediated alterations to NPC conformations could arise from an increase in nuclear membrane tension or force transmission through LINC - complex proteins and nuclear lamins .

In support of this mechanism , recent work by the Roca - Cusachs group found that direct force application to the nucleus is sufficient to promote nuclear entry of YAP , a mechanosensi - tive transcription factor 73 . The increase in nuclear YAP localiza - tion occurs through increased nuclear import of YAP , mediated by an increase in the permeability of the NPC for larger proteins , and the partial unfolding of YAP to further promote transition through the NPC 73 . Besides an increase in NPC permeability , other nuclear envelope proteins may modulate the import or export of mechanosensitive transcription factors , such as YAP / TAZ and MKL1 47 , 57 , 144 , through additional mechanisms ( Fig . 2 ) . Lamin A / C has also been shown to sequester transcription fac - tors , such as retinoblastoma protein 145 , 146 and Fos 44 , at the nuclear periphery and thereby control their activity within the nucleus . Through these mechanisms , the nuclear lamina may further mod - ulate gene expression and cell behaviour . Whereas short - term force application has been shown to rap - idly induce transcription 28 , 43 , long - term force application ( 12 h ) can result in a global increase in heterochromatin and transcrip - tional repression 4 , suggesting that there may be a different response to force application that depends on the duration of stimulation . Future studies will also need to consider differences in the response across cell types , as certain cell types may have an increased sus - ceptibility to chromatin stretching that results from differences in lamin A / C expression 61 . Lastly , although it appears that chromatin stretching can rapidly increase gene activation and PolII recruit - ment ( Fig . 2 ) , prolonged mechanical stimulation probably activates mechanoresponsive feedback mechanisms that further influence gene expression , nuclear organization and nucleo - cytoskeletal force transmission . Notably , mechanical force application to iso - lated nuclei through nesprins results in lamin - A / C recruitment and emerin phosphorylation , causing nuclear stiffening 26 . Thus , biochemical signalling pathways activated by mechanoresponsive genes could result in similar feedback loops that alter the respon - siveness of the cell to further mechanical forces . Technologies to study nuclear mechanotransduction One major challenge in the field of nuclear mechanotransduction is uncoupling changes in nuclear structure , organization and tran - scription that are directly due to force application to the nucleus from those that are secondary to changes in cytoplasmic mecha - nosensitive signalling pathways . Addressing this challenge requires ( 1 ) improvements in the temporal resolution of nuclear events to distinguish between immediate and downstream consequences ; ( 2 ) enhanced detection of force - induced changes in chromatin organi - zation and local transcription ; ( 3 ) direct measurements of intranu - clear and perinuclear forces ; and ( 4 ) experimental approaches that can physically separate contributions of mechanotransduction on the nucleus and cytoplasm . One method to study the force - induced relocation of genes within the nucleus , or the local stretching and unfolding of chro - matin loops within a single chromosomal region , is to insert arrays of LacO sequences into specific genomic loci and then fluores - cently label these sites with GFP – LacI 28 ( Fig . 3 ) . This reporter sys - tem enables the assessment of how effective chromatin stretching , measured by an increased distance between adjacent GFP – LacI loci , corresponds to changes in gene expression of the reporter gene , which can be quantified by fluorescence in situ hybridiza - tion of the RNA transcript . Recent developments in the labelling of specific genomic regions of endogenous genes using CRISPR – Cas9 and related systems could help to overcome the challenge of having to insert large LacO arrays or using bacterial artificial chromosome reporters , and may even enable multi - colour imag - ing by using dCas9 constructs from different bacterial species , each tagged with a different fluorophore 147 , 148 ( Fig . 3 ) . Measuring changes in the 4D nucleome could be further aided by the use of super - resolution microscopy , which allows resolving of features that are 20 – 100 nm in intact cells 149 ( Table 1 ) . In addition to optical microscopy - based approaches , changes to the arrangement of chro - mosomes can be studied using sequence - based technology , such as Hi - C , which is based on chromosome conformation capture - based methodology 150 ( Fig . 3 ) . Hi - C can detect chromatin interactions across the entire genome , both within and between chromosomes , by covalently crosslinking protein – DNA complexes in their in situ configuration followed by deep sequencing . Whereas Hi - C is tradi - tionally performed on large cell numbers ( approximately 10 6 cells ) , approaches are currently under development that extent this tech - nique to smaller cell numbers and even single cells 151 . Changes in the accessibility of DNA regions may provide additional informa - tion on force - induced changes in chromatin organization that could modulate transcriptional activity . One exciting approach is the assay for transposase - accessible chromatin using sequencing ( ATAC - seq ) , which identifies accessible chromatin regions on the basis of the insertion of a hyperactive transposase and subsequent genome GFP – LacI LacO sequence Gene of interest New inter - chromosomal interaction Lost intra - chromosomal interaction High - force environment Low - force environment DNA isolation and digestion Interaction enrichment and deep sequencing Loci - specific sgRNAs Force application Force application FISH detection of transcription Distance between GFP spots c a b Super - resolution imaging 5 ′ 5 ′ 3 ′ 3 ′ dCas9 Neisseria meningitidis Streptococcus pyogenes dCas9 Fig . 3 | Technologies to study the effect of force transmission to the nucleus on genome organization and gene regulation . a , Schematic of a reporter transgene that measures chromatin stretching .

Applying Hi - C and ATAC - seq analyses to cells in high - and low - force environments , or to cells before and after nuclear force application , should provide detailed information on how external forces alters the spatial interactome of chromatin , which could be further coupled with RNA - sequencing analyses to determine whether chromatin changes correspond to changes in gene transcription . Molecular tension sensors can provide insights into the forces applied across specific cellular structures . Biophysical measurements of intact cells and isolated nuclei indicate that approximately 1 – 10 nN are required to induce substantial nuclear deformation 116 , 153 , 154 . The recent development of a nesprin tension biosensor has enabled the first measurements of forces transmitted across the LINC com - plex 25 , 155 . Using an artificial nesprin - 2 giant construct containing a Förster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) - based tension module , it was shown that force transmission changed with both myosin activ - ity and cell elongation , and that the basal and apical sections of the nucleus are exposed to different forces 25 . Potential limitations of the current version of the tension sensor include a low signal - to - noise ratio , the insertion site of the FRET tension module , and a limit of the force range of about 6 pN 156 , 157 , encouraging further work in this area . Lastly , one way to circumvent the confounding cytoplasmic sig - nalling events that arise from applying force at the cell surface is to study isolated nuclei or to use micromanipulation to apply force in close proximity to the nucleus 158 , 159 . Using magnetic beads bound to the cytoplasmic domain of nesprins allows studying the role of the LINC complex in nuclear mechanotransduction and targeting specific nesprin isoforms 26 . One limitation of using isolated nuclei is that the isolation procedure may perturb nuclear structure , as well as the chemical composition of the nuclear interior ( for example , ion concentrations , ATP levels and molecular crowding ) , which could affect nuclear mechanics and other nuclear processes 42 . Furthermore , working with isolated nuclei limits experiments to studying factors that originate within the nucleus and excludes studying the import of cytoplasmic factors . Disrupting the LINC complex in intact cells allows exchange of biochemical molecules and can help to identify events that require force transmission to the nucleus and nuclear deformation 159 . However , external force application may still induce nuclear deformation through LINC - complex independent mechanisms . Future perspective The field of mechanobiology has substantially evolved and advanced in the past two decades , greatly increasing our knowl - edge of how mechanical cues govern cell behaviour . It is now well - recognized that nuclear envelope proteins have an important role in the cellular response to mechanical stimuli , and that forces are transmitted from the cell surface and cytoskeleton to the inte - rior of the nucleus . Findings suggest that the nucleus can act as a cellular mechanosensor . Nonetheless , many questions remain , including to what extent the nucleus itself responds to mechanical forces , where such nuclear mechanotransduction processes occur , and whether these nuclear processes complement or act in paral - lel or downstream of cytoplasmic signalling pathways . To further untangle the strong interplay between the nucleus , cytoskeleton and cell surface will require an integrative approach that uses bio - physical assays , genetic manipulation , high - throughput genom - ics and proteomics , and live - cell imaging with high spatial and temporal resolution . Furthermore , experimental approaches must be used that attempt to uncouple nuclear changes due to indirect mechanisms ( that is , cytoplasmic signals that modulate chroma - tin organization and transcription ) from force - induced , nucleus - intrinsic events , for example , by utilizing models in which nuclear force transmission is disrupted while other cytoplasmic mechano - sensitive pathways remain intact . Unravelling the force - sensitive molecular regulatory networks controlled by the nucleus and the nuclear lamina will not only increase our understanding of cel - lular mechanotransduction , but may also encourage the devel - opment of novel therapeutical approaches to treat the currently incurable diseases that arise from impaired nuclear mechanics and mechanotransduction .
