Schmid The functions of the actin cytoskeleton in post - Golgi trafﬁcking are still poorly understood . Here , we report the role of LIM Kinase 1 ( LIMK1 ) and its substrate coﬁlin in the trafﬁcking of apical and basolateral proteins in Madin - Darby canine kidney cells . Our data indicate that LIMK1 and coﬁlin organize a specialized population of actin ﬁlaments at the Golgi complex that is selectively required for the emergence of an apical cargo route to the plasma membrane ( PM ) . Quantitative pulse - chase live imaging experiments showed that overexpression of kinase - dead LIMK1 ( LIMK1 - KD ) , or of LIMK1 small interfering RNA , or of an activated coﬁlin mutant ( coﬁlin S3A ) , selectively slowed down the exit from the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) of the apical PM marker p75 - green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) but did not interfere with the apical PM marker glycosyl phosphatidylinositol - YFP or the basolateral PM marker neural cell adhesion molecule - GFP . High - resolution live imaging experiments of carrier formation and release by the TGN and analysis of peri - Golgi actin dynamics using photoactivatable GFP suggest a scenario in which TGN - localized LIMK1 - coﬁlin regulate a population of actin ﬁlaments required for dynamin - syndapin - cortactin – dependent generation and / or ﬁssion of precursors to p75 transporters . INTRODUCTION The organization of polarized intracellular trafﬁcking to the plasma membrane ( PM ) involves a close cooperation be - tween cargo proteins , adaptors and cytoskeletal elements that takes place at major sorting organelles , e . g . , the Golgi complex and recycling endosomes ( Bonifacino and Traub , 2003 ; Rodriguez - Boulan et al . , 2005 ) . Newly synthesized pro - teins destined for endosomes , lysosomes , and the basolateral PM of epithelial cells segregate into nascent post - Golgi or postendosomal vesicles via tyrosine , dileucine , or mono - leucine sorting signals , clathrin adaptors , and accessory pro - teins ( Bonifacino and Traub , 2003 ; Rodriguez - Boulan et al . , 2005 ; Deborde et al . , 2008 ) . By contrast , proteins destined for the apical PM are sorted into nascent post - Golgi transporters via N - and O - glycans , specialized transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains or gly - cosyl phosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchors that interact with lipid domains ( rafts ) , lectins , or microtubule ( MT ) motors ( Scheiffele et al . , 1995 ; Simons and Ikonen , 1997 ; Yeaman et al . , 1997 ; Delacour et al . , 2005 , 2006 ; Rodriguez - Boulan et al . , 2005 ) . It is very well established that MT motors of the kinesin or dynein families play key roles in the generation and transcytoplasmic transport of tubular and vesicular transporters destined to the apical PM of Madin - Darby ca - nine kidney ( MDCK ) cells ( Kreitzer et al . , 2000 ; Noda et al . , 2001 ; Tai et al . , 2001 ; Allan et al . , 2002 ; Musch , 2004 ; Jaulin et al . , 2007 ) . By contrast , our knowledge of the speciﬁc roles of the actin cytoskeleton in intracellular transport routes re - mains fragmentary , unlike the situation at the PM , where various mechanisms involving the actin cytoskeleton in en - docytic routes have been well documented ( Erickson et al . , 1996 ; Qualmann et al . , 2000 ; Allan et al . , 2002 ; Luna et al . , 2002 ; Stamnes , 2002 ; Carreno et al . , 2004 ; Matas et al . , 2004 ; Bonazzi et al . , 2005 ; Perret et al . , 2005 ; Yarar et al . , 2005 ; Egea et al . , 2006 ; McNiven and Thompson , 2006 ) . The exit of cargo proteins from the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) involves their concentration into vesicular or tubular transporters ; various steps in the generation and ﬁssion of these transporters might involve the actin cytoskeleton and associated proteins . Studies in polarized epithelial cells ( MDCK ) have shown that the Rho GTPase cdc42 , an actin cytoskeleton organizer found at the Golgi ( Erickson et al . , 1996 ; Kroschewski et al . , 1999 ; Musch et al . , 2001 ) , actin - depolymerizing drugs ( Lazaro - Dieguez et al . , 2007 ) , and Arp 2 / 3 ( Rozelle et al . , 2000 ; Guerriero et al . , 2006 ) affect differ - entially the exit of apical and basolateral proteins from the TGN . In none of these cases , however , the speciﬁc roles of This article was published online ahead of print in MBC in Press ( http : / / www . molbiolcell . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1091 / mbc .

The GTPase dynamin , which associates with the actin cytoskeleton to mediate ﬁssion of endocytic vesicles from the PM ( Song et al . , 2004 ) , also mediates ﬁssion from the TGN of transport carriers for the apical protein p75 neurotrophin receptor ( p75 ) in MDCK cells ( Kreitzer et al . , 2000 ; Bonazzi et al . , 2005 ; Ya - Wen Liu et al . , 2008 ) . Interest - ingly , dynamin 2 mediates ﬁssion from the TGN of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein carriers in a cell - speciﬁc manner ( Cao et al . , 2000 , 2005 ; Bonazzi et al . , 2005 ) . The cargo / cell - speciﬁc TGN ﬁssion activity of dynamin 2 may reﬂect car - go / cell speciﬁc requirements for its partners , cortactin and syndapin 2 , involved in its recruitment to the TGN ( Cao et al . , 2005 ; Kessels et al . , 2006 ; Yang et al . , 2006 ) . Additionally , these dynamin partners may contribute to the generation of post - Golgi routes through dynamin - independent functions , e . g . , syndapin 2’s abilities to promote actin ﬁlament assem - bly via Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) or to bend membranes via its BAR domain ( Kessels et al . , 2006 ) . The latter function of syndapin 2 could be critically needed , e . g . , to shape tubular carriers , such as those used by apical cargo proteins to exit the TGN ( Kreitzer et al . , 2000 , 2003 ) . Stow and coworkers ( Percival et al . , 2004 ) have shown that the Golgi complex displays a population of short and branched actin ﬁlaments . Practically nothing is known about the regulatory mechanisms involved in the organization of these Golgi ﬁlaments and about how these mechanisms contribute to the generation of speciﬁc cargo routes exiting the Golgi complex . A clue to actin ﬁlament organization at the Golgi may lie in recent studies on LIM kinases ( LIMK ) 1 and 2 , widely expressed down - regulators of the actin - sever - ing activity of coﬁlin that in neurons are known to operate downstream of cdc42 and PAK1 ( Bamburg , 1999 ; Foletta et al . , 2004 ; Acevedo et al . , 2006 ) . Importantly , a study in hy - pocampal neurons ( Rosso et al . , 2004 ) showed that LIMK1 localizes to the Golgi complex via its LIM domains and to axonal growth cones via its postsynaptic density 95 / disc - large / zona occludens domains and that overexpression of LIMK1 promotes axonal growth and differentiation . These experiments also showed that overexpression of wild - type LIMK1 , or of various mutants of this protein , accelerated or slowed down axonal growth , promoted or inhibited accu - mulation of different axonal markers , and altered the dy - namics of Golgi markers . Based on these results , Rosso et al . ( 2004 ) suggested that the changes in axonal morphogenesis they observed might result from regulation of Golgi protein trafﬁcking by LIMK1 . However , their experiments did not directly analyze the kinetics of cargo protein exit from the TGN and the long transfection times used ( 12 h ) did not discard other equally likely interpretations of their data , i . e . , that LIMK1 might alter the biosynthesis or degradation of axonal proteins , their cytoplasmic transport , or their deliv - ery by vesicular fusion to the PM . Furthermore , although Rosso et al . ( 2004 ) showed that overexpression of LIMK1 or coﬁlin resulted in changes in actin levels at the Golgi , they neither carried out a detailed analysis of actin dynamics at the Golgi nor characterized the actin - based machinery re - quired for cargo protein exit from the Golgi . Here , we have rigorously tested the hypothesis that LIMK1 - coﬁlin organizes a population of actin ﬁlaments at the Golgi complex that is required for polarized trafﬁcking of cargo proteins out of this organelle . To this end , we characterized the roles of LIMK1 - coﬁlin in endoplasmic re - ticulum ( ER ) - Golgi and post - Golgi trafﬁcking of apical and basolateral cargo proteins in MDCK cells by using biochem - ical methods and quantitative live imaging protocols that we previously developed previously to measure the kinetics of Golgi exit of PM proteins ( Kreitzer et al . , 2000 , 2003 ) . In addition , we used MCDK cell lines expressing actin cou - pled to photoactivatable GFP ( Patterson and Lippincott - Schwartz , 2002 ) to show that activated coﬁlin increased actin dynamics at the Golgi region . Other experiments demon - strated that these actin ﬁlaments were involved in recruiting dynamin 2 and suggest that the dynamin - interacting pro - teins cortactin and syndapin 2 are also involved in cargo protein exit from the Golgi complex . Together , our results conclusively show that LIMK1 - coﬁlin organize a dynamic population of actin ﬁlaments at the Golgi region that shows remarkable selectivity in promoting the dynamin - mediated ﬁssion of carrier vesicles for the apical marker p75 - green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) and a related receptor , NHR2 , but not for a different apical marker , GPI - YFP , or for a basolat - eral marker , neural cell adhesion molecule ( NCAM ) - GFP . Our experiments constitute the ﬁrst demonstration of a key trafﬁcking role for LIMK1 , coﬁlin , and actin ﬁlaments these proteins organize at the Golgi complex . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture MDCK cells were cultured in DMEM ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 . Cells were seeded onto heat - sterilized , 25 - mm round coverslips and grown for 48 h before microin - jection . After injection , cells were maintained at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 for 1 h 30 min allow the expression of injected cDNAs . Newly synthesized protein was accumulated in the TGN during a 30 min to 3h incubation at 20°C in bicar - bonate - free DMEM with 5 % FBS , HEPES , and 100 (cid:1) g / ml cycloheximide ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) . The synchronized release of p75 - GFP , GPI - GFP , or NCAM - GFP after shifting to the temperature permissive for transport out of the Golgi ( 32°C ) was monitored by time - lapse ﬂuorescence microscopy in recording medium ( Hanks’ solution with 5 % FBS , HEPES , glucose and 100 (cid:1) g / ml cycloheximide ) ( Kreitzer et al . , 2000 ) . In other experiments , exit from Golgi was recorded in presence of and after a 10 - min pretreatment with cytochalasin D ( 2 (cid:1) M ; Sigma - Aldrich ) or jasplakinolide ( 100 nM ; Calbiochem , San Diego , CA ) . Microinjection cDNAs were diluted in injection buffer ( 10 mM HEPES and 140 mM KCl , pH 7 . 4 ) before intranuclear microinjection by using back - loaded glass capillaries and a Narishige micromanipulator ( Narishige , Tokyo , Japan ) . Cells were coinjected with cDNAs encoding p75 - GFP ( 1 (cid:1) g / ml ) , NCAM - GFP ( 10 (cid:1) g / ml ) , or GPI - YFP ( 10 (cid:1) g / ml ) and LIMKs , coﬁlin , dynamin , syndapin 2 , or cortactin mutants ( 20 (cid:1) g / ml ) . Live Imaging and Quantiﬁcation of Fluorescence Expression , accumulation in the TGN , time - lapse imaging and analysis of TGN exit rates for GFP - tagged markers in single cells , were performed as described previously ( Kreitzer et al . , 2000 ) . p75 - GFP and NCAM - GFP ﬂuo - rescent images were collected using a Nikon inverted microscope ( TE 300 ; Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) with ﬂuorescein ﬁlter B - 2E / C DM 505 ( Chroma Tech - nology , Brattleboro , VT ) and a charge - coupled device camera ( ORCAII - ER ; Hamamatsu , Bridgewater , NJ ) . The acquisition and intensity measurements of the images were performed using MetaMorph imaging software ( Molecu - lar Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) . For quantitative measurements of cargo protein exit from TGN , cells were imaged using a 20 (cid:1) lens ( Plan Fluor , numerical aperture [ NA ] 0 . 50 ) , and images were collected at 15 - min intervals for 5 h after the temperature shift ( for p75 - GFP ) , at 5 - min intervals for 2 . 5 h ( for NCAM - GFP ) , and at 10 - min intervals for 3 h ( for GPI - YFP ) . Expression of p75 - GFP , NCAM - GFP or GPI - GFP always coincided with the expression of the LIMKs coﬁlin , dynamin , syndapin 2 , or cortactin mutants when cDNAs were coinjected , as determined by immunoﬂuorescence with anti - hemagglutinin ( HA ) , FLAG , Xpress , or myc antibodies . For morphological analysis at the Golgi complex ( high - magniﬁ - cation movies ) , cells were imaged one cell at a time by using a 100 (cid:1) lens ( Plan Apochromat , NA 1 . 4 ) , and images were collected at 1 - s intervals for 1 to 2 min . To image p75 - GFP containing post - Golgi carriers studies we coexpressed LIMK1 - kinase - dead ( KD ) or coﬁlin S3A and p75 - GFP , or dynamin 2 wild - type , LIMK1 - KD , and p75 - GFP . Live frames were acquired every 2 s for 3 min , by using a 40 (cid:1) objective to capture the entire cell . We have been successful in this type of triple microinjection experiments ( Supplemental Figure 5 ) . Ex - pression of dynamin 2 and LIMK1 - KD was assessed by immunoﬂuorescence . p75 - GFP – positive structures were scored as carriers provided they exhibited LIM Kinase 1 and Coﬁlin Regulate TGN Trafﬁcking Vol . 20 , January 1 , 2009 439 the previously described vesicular or tubular shape and carrier velocity typical or kinesin transport ( Kreitzer et al . , 2000 ) . Quantiﬁcation of p75 - GFP at the Cell Surface Transfection of the LIMK1 - KD or coﬁlin S3A plasmid was performed by nucleofection with Amaxa technology by using 20 (cid:1) g of cDNA / 4 (cid:1) 10 6 cells . Twenty - four hours later , subconﬂuent cells were injected with p75 - GFP cDNA . Cells were incubated for 1h 30 min at 37°C to allow expression of p75 - GFP , and then p75 - GFP was accumulated in the Golgi by incubation at 20°C for 3 h . Cells were shifted to 32°C and ﬁxed 0 , 60 , 120 , and 240 min after release of the Golgi temperature block in 2 % paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 2 min . p75 - GFP at the cell surface was immunolabeled with a monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) that recognizes an extracellular epitope of p75 , followed by Cy3 - conjugated anti - mouse antibodies . Images of p75 - GFP and anti - p75 – injected cells were acquired using identical acquisition settings and exposure times for all samples in a single experiment . The integrated ﬂuo - rescence intensities in GFP and anti - p75 images were measured , and the ratio anti - p75 : p75 - GFP intensities was calculated for each group of injected cells . The integrated ﬂuorescence of 15 – 20 injected cells was measured at each time point . Finally , expression of LIMK1 - KD and coﬁlin S3A were assessed by immunoﬂuorescence after permeabilization with Triton X - 100 during 7 min at room temperature . Golgi Localization of Dynamin 2 , Syndapin 2 , and Cortactin MDCK cells permanently expressing sialyl transferase fused to monomeric red ﬂuorescent protein were transfected with LIMK1 - KD alone or with LIMK1 - KD (cid:2) dynamin 2bb - GFP or syndapin 2 - GFP constructs by nucleofec - tion with Amaxa technology by using 20 (cid:1) g of cDNA per 4 (cid:1) 10 6 cells . Twenty - four hours after plating the cells at subconﬂuence , cells were ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in 100 mM piperazine - N , N (cid:3) - bis ( 2 - ethanesulfonic acid ) , 5 mM EGTA , and 5 mM MgCl 2 , pH 6 . 9 , and stained with the dynamin mAb HUDY - 1 or the cortactin polyclonal antibody ( c - Tyr ) and the antibody against HA - tag to visualized LIMK1 - KD . The amount of dynamin , syndapin 2 , and cortactin at the Golgi level under various experimental conditions was mea - sured by digital microscopy ( MetaMorph software ) and expressed as the integrated dynamin or syndapin 2 - or cortactin - speciﬁc ﬂuorescence intensity at the TGN as a percentage of the total ﬂuorescence in the cells . Small Interfering RNA ( siRNA ) To generate LIMK1 siRNA , we used oligonucleotides ( nt ) containing a 21 nucleotide sequence derived from canine LIMK1 transcript ( GAACGUG - GUGGUGGCUGACUU ) . As a negative control , we construct mutated LIMK1 siRNA in which two bases in the 21 - nt target recognition sequence were mutated ( GAACGUUGUGGUGGCUGCCUU ) . To silence LIMK 2 , we used a 21 - nucleotide sequence derived from canine LIMK2 ( UGUUGACAGAGUA - CAUCGAUU ) . pSUPER construct targeted against luciferase was used as a negative control . The oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon RNA Technologies ( Chicago , IL ) . Transient transfection of the RNA interfer - ence ( RNAi ) plasmid was performed by nucleofection with Amaxa technol - ogy using 3 (cid:1) g of oligonucleotides / 4 (cid:1) 10 6 cells . Cells were transfected a second time 72 h later and analyzed 48 h after the second transfection . Measuring Actin Dynamics at the Golgi Region MDCK cells permanently transfected with actin - photoactivatable ( paGFP ) were locally photoactivated at the Golgi region , identiﬁed by the exogenous Golgi - resident protein ST - mRFP , expressed by injection of its cDNA . For activation , we used a laser - scanning confocal microscope ( model TCS SP2 ; Leica Microsystems , Deerﬁeld , IL ) with a 405 - nm laser ( 20 mW ) and a HCX PL APO 63 (cid:1) , 1 . 4 NA oil objective . Photoactivation was complete in (cid:4) 1 s . The decay of ﬂuorescence in the photoactivated region over time was monitored under 488 - nm excitation at 0 . 8 - to 1 . 6 - s intervals for 3 min and used to measure the mobility of actin . At each time point after the transient Golgi localized activation , we also measured the ﬂuorescence intensity at several regions of interest ( ROIs ) , using LCS software ( Leica Microsystems ) . Curves were generated from between 10 and 15 individual cells recorded for each experimental condition from two to three separate experiments . The photo - bleaching of GFP during the time of the experiment was negligible . To maximize the signal of paGFP , it was necessary to open the pinhole aperture to 2 . 75 airy . Noise reduction on ﬂuorescence images was accomplished by subtraction of the ﬂuorescence of an identically shaped region outside the cell . cDNAs encoding coﬁlin S3A and ST - mRFP were coinjected 4 h before the sequential time - lapse images were acquired . Jasplakinolide ( 100 nM ) and latrunculin B ( 1 (cid:1) M ) were added to the recording medium (cid:4) 10 – 20 min before the imaging . Differential interference contrast / Normarski images were col - lected to monitor changes in the cell shape due to the detachment from the coverslip induced by latrunculin B . Cells with excessive alterations in cell shape caused by the drug treatment were discarded . The curves obtained from logarithmic transformation of the data ( or from plotting the ﬂuorescence data on semilogarithmic paper ) , were used to obtain the half - times of actin diffusion in the Golgi area . Actin diffusion coefﬁcients were calculated from the equation D (cid:5) W 2 / 4 t 1 / 2 , where W is the radius of the photoactivated Golgi region ( 6 (cid:1) m in our experiments ) and 4 t 1 / 2 is the half - time of diffusion ( Kreis et al . , 1982 ) . RESULTS LIMK and Coﬁlin Selectively Regulate the Exit of p75 - GFP from the TGN To study the role of LIMK1 , LIMK2 , and coﬁlin in protein exit from the TGN , we comicroinjected nuclei of subconﬂu - ent MDCK cells with cDNAs encoding p75 - GFP and the kinase - dead mutants LIMK1 - KD or LIMK2 - KD , which are known to behave as dominant - negative mutants ( Arber et al . , 1998 ; Sumi et al . , 1999 ) or with cDNAs encoding consti - tutively activated coﬁlin ( coﬁlin S3A ) . The cells were kept at 37°C fo r 1 h 30 min toallow synthesis of the proteins and at 20°C for an additiona l 3 h in thepresence of cycloheximide , to allow exit of p75 - GFP from the ER and accumulation in the TGN . Expression of LIMK and coﬁlin mutants did not interfere with the accumulation of p75 - GFP at the Golgi complex ( Figure 1A , top , 0 min ) and did not noticeably alter Golgi morphology . Radioactive pulse - chase experiments conﬁrmed that the transport of p75 - GFP from ER - to - Golgi complex was not affected by LIMK1 - KD ( Supplemental Fig - ure 1 ) . The second part of our pulse - chase imaging protocol was to change the cells to transport - permissive temperature , 32°C , to record the exit of p75 - GFP by time - lapse micros - copy , as described previously ( Kreitzer et al . , 2000 ) . In con - trol cells , p75 - GFP underwent Golgi - to - plasma membrane transport within 4 – 5 h . After 315 min , p75 - GFP was pre - dominantly localized at the cell surface ; correspondingly , ﬂuorescence within the Golgi area was markedly reduced ( Figure 1A , control , bottom , 315 min ) . By contrast , when we coinjected a plasmid encoding a kinase dead form of LIMK1 , incapable of phosphorylating coﬁlin and down - regulating its activity ( Rosso et al . , 2004 ) , the exit of p75 - GFP from the Golgi area was strongly inhibited ( Figure 1A , LIMK1 - KD ) . Parallel experiments showed that LIMK1 but not LIMK1 - KD promoted phosphorylation of coﬁlin at the Golgi region ( data not shown ) . Expression of a constitutively active coﬁ - lin mutant also strongly inhibited the exit of p75 - GFP ( Fig - ure 1A , coﬁlin S3A ) . Expression of kinase - dead LIMK2 also decreased Golgi exit , albeit to a much smaller extent than LIMK1 - KD and Coﬁlin S3A ( Figure 1A , LIMK2 - KD ) . Quantiﬁcation of GFP ﬂuorescence at the Golgi region ( see Materials and Methods ) at various short times ( 0 – 4 h ) after transfer to transport - permissive temperature ( Figure 1B ) al - lowed us to directly measure the exit kinetics of p75 - GFP from the Golgi complex under various experimental condi - tions . LIMK1 - KD and Coﬁlin S3A drastically reduced the Golgi exit kinetics of p75 - GFP ; by contrast , LIMK2 - KD only induced a moderate , albeit statistically signiﬁcant , reduction of p75 - GFP exit kinetics . We constructed a biochemical model of p75 - GFP transport ( see Supplemental Material ) that included rate constants k 1 ( p75 - GFP export out from the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi ) , k 2 ( Golgi export of p75 - GFP ) , and k 3 ( degradation ) ( Figure 1C ) . This model illus - trates that the total p75 - GFP ﬂuorescence stays constant in cells treated with LIMK1 - KD ( 0 . 4 % decrease after 200 min ) , whereas it decreases by 8 , 6 , and 5 % after 200 min in control , coﬁlin S3A - , and LIMK2 - KD - treated cells . This suggests that the decrease in total ﬂuorescence in the latter three cases is probably due to a biological event , e . g . , protein degradation after p75 - GFP has reached the plasma membrane , and not to photobleaching , which would affect p75 - GFP in a similar manner in any condition . S . B . Salvarezza et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 440 Using this model , we calculated k 2 under the various experimental conditions ( Figure 1D ) . For control cells , k 2 was 0 . 029 (cid:6) 0 . 010 min (cid:7) 1 . LIMK1 - KD ; coﬁlin S3A , and LIMK2 - KD overexpression decreased k 2 , respectively , to 0 . 003 (cid:6) 0 . 002 min (cid:7) 1 ( 9 . 6 (cid:1) reduction ) , 0 . 006 (cid:6) 0 . 003 min (cid:7) 1 ( 5 (cid:1) reduction ) and 0 . 019 (cid:6) 0 . 006 min (cid:7) 1 ( 1 . 5 (cid:1) reduction ) . In a separate group of experiments , we quantiﬁed the delivery of p75 - GFP to the cell surface by measuring the ratio of surface - associated p75 ( immunostaining with an ectodomain antibody ) to total p75 ( p75 - GFP ﬂuorescence intensity ) , as described previously ( Kreitzer et al . , 2003 ) . These experiments demonstrated a strong inhibition in p75 - GFP surface transport caused by overexpression of LIMK1 - KD or coﬁlin S3A ( Figure 1E ) . Note that 250 min after release of the 20°C temperature block , 100 % of p75 - GFP has arrived at the plasma membrane in control cells , whereas in cells overexpressing LIMK1 - KD , (cid:4) 50 % of the total p75 - GFP has arrived at the cell surface , and the rest was retained at the Golgi complex ( Figure 1 , C and E ) . The apparently stronger inhibition of Golgi exit than of surface delivery of p75 - GFP may be the result of the incoming p75 - GFP from the ER that accumulates at the Golgi when Figure 1 . LIMK1 - KD and coﬁlinS3A block Golgi exit and surface delivery of p75 - GFP . ( A ) p75 - GFP expressed by nuclear injection of its cDNA in subconﬂuent MDCK cells , accumulated in the TGN after a 20°C temperature block ; its exit from TGN and transport to the plasma membrane were assessed after switch to transport - permissive temperature ( 32°C ) . Note surface arrival of p75 - GFP after 315 min in control cells . By contrast , in cells coinjected with cDNAs encoding LIMK1 - KD , coﬁlin S3A , or LIMK2 - KD , p75 - GFP was retained in the Golgi region . Bars , 20 (cid:1) m . ( B ) p75 - GFP ﬂuorescence at the TGN was quantiﬁed for each condition after shift to 32°C ( 15 – 20 cells / experimental condition , experiments were repeated 2 – 3 times ) and expressed as percent of TGN ﬂuorescence at t (cid:5) 0 . Differences between control and LIMK or coﬁlin samples were statistically signiﬁcant ( p (cid:8) 0 . 0001 ) . ( C ) Fluorescence data were ﬁtted to a mathematical model ( see text ) . ( D ) Rate constants for TGN exit , obtained from this model , are expressed as mean (cid:6) SD . ( E ) Arrival of p75 - GFP at the cell surface , measured as the ratio surface immunoﬂuorescence / total GFP , was inhibited by LIMK1 - KD and coﬁlin S3A expression ( p (cid:8) 0 . 0001 ) . LIM Kinase 1 and Coﬁlin Regulate TGN Trafﬁcking Vol . 20 , January 1 , 2009 441 exit is inhibited by LIMK1 or coﬁlin S3A . Together , these experiments suggested an important role of LIM kinases in regulating the kinetics of p75 - GFP exit from the TGN of MDCK cells . LIMK1 - KD and CoﬁlinS3A Inhibit the Exit from the TGN of NHR2 - GFP but Not of NCAM - GFP or GPI - Yellow Fluorescent Protein ( YFP ) We next examined the effect of LIMK1 - KD on exit from TGN of GPI - YFP , a lipid raft - anchored apical protein , of NCAM - GFP , a basolateral PM protein , and of NHR2 - GFP , a PM protein structurally and functionally related to p75 ( Murray et al . , 2004 ) . LIMK1 - KD overexpression did not inhibit the exit of NCAM - GFP ( Figure 2A ) or GPI - YFP ( Figure 2B ) but strongly inhibited the exit from the TGN of NHR2 - GFP ( Figure 2C ) . Our results demonstrate that the regulatory roles of LIMK1 and coﬁlin on post - TGN trafﬁcking are highly speciﬁc for a subset of PM proteins that currently only include p75 - GFP and NHR2 - GFP . RNAi Suppression of LIMK1 but Not LIMK2 Inhibits p75 - GFP Exit from the TGN To test directly the involvement of LIMK1 and LIMK2 in the exit of p75 - GFP from the TGN , we used an RNA interference ( siRNA ) approach . Introduction of LIMK1 or LIMK2 siR - NAs that have been extensively characterized by other stud - ies ( Tomiyoshi et al . , 2004 , Chen and Macara , 2006 ) resulted in 72 and 95 % reduction in the protein levels , respectively , as determined by immunoblot analysis 48 h after electropora - tion ( Figure 3A ) . Efﬁcient knockdown of LIMK1 and LIMK2 required two sequential electroporations , spaced 3 d apart . Knockdown of either LIMK1 or LIMK2 suppressed coﬁlin phosphorylation by (cid:4) 74 % without affecting the total levels of coﬁlin protein ( Figure 3A ) . Strikingly , only LIMK1 knock - down induced a signiﬁcant delay in the Golgi exit of p75 - GFP ( Figure 3B ) ; LIMK2 knockdown had no effect ( Figure 3C ) . The TGN exit rates of p75 - GFP in MDCK cells treated with control siRNA ( luciferase and mutated oligonucleo - tides ) were faster than in microinjected parental MDCK cells . This may reﬂect different cellular responses to the different transfection protocols used in either case ( microin - jection in Figure 1 and electroporation in Figure 3 ) . LIMK1 - KD inhibited the exit of p75 - GFP from the TGN more drastically than LIMK1 siRNA ( compare Figure 1B with Figure 3B ) . A possible explanation of this phenomenon is that whereas we could easily identify the population of cells expressing high levels of LIMK1 - KD through the HA - tag added to LIMK1 , it was difﬁcult to identify a homoge - neous population of cells expressing low levels of LIMK1 in siRNA experiments because appropriately sensitive anti - bodies were not available . Together , the results shown in Figure 1 , 2 , and 3 demonstrate that LIMK1 selectively reg - ulates the exit of an apical route from the Golgi complex in MDCK cells . LIMK1 but Not LIMK2 Localizes to the Golgi Apparatus The different effects of LIMK1 and LIMK2 knockdown in post - Golgi transport were somewhat surprising considering the similarity of the two enzymes . To investigate whether the different trafﬁcking regulatory activities of LIMK1 - KD and LIMK2 - KD on p75 - GFP transport may be attributed to different subcellular localizations of LIMK1 and LIMK2 , we studied the localization of endogenous and overexpressed LIMK1 and LIMK2 in MDCK cell lines expressing the trans - Golgi / TGN resident proteins Sialyltransferase - monomeric red ﬂuorescent protein ( Sialyl - T ) ( Figure 3D ) or galactosyl transferase - cyan ﬂuorescent protein ( GalT ) ( Supplemental Figure 2 ) . Both endogenous LIMK1 ( Figure 3D , top ) and overexpressed LIMK1 - KD ( Supplemental Figure 2 , top ) co - localized extensively with Sialyl - T or Gal - T , in agreement with previous observations in neuronal cells ( Rosso et al . , 2004 ) . Additional experiments showed that LIMK1 colocal - ized more precisely with TGN 38 ( Figure 3E , left ) than with the cis - medial Golgi marker Giantin ( Figure 3E , right ) . Treat - ment of MDCK cells with nocodazole resulted in fragmen - Figure 2 . LIMK1 - KD does not block exit from TGN of NCAM - GFP or GPI - YFP . The exit of NCAM - GFP ( A ) , GPI - YFP ( B ) , or NHR2 - GFP , a protein related to p75 ( C ) from the TGN after shift to 32°C was recorded as described in Materials and Methods ( 2 – 3 experi - ments , 15 – 20 cells / experimental condition ) . Note that expression of LIMK1 - KD does not interfere with the exit of NCAM - GFP or GPI - YFP from the TGN , but it does interfere with the exit of NHR2 - GFP from the TGN . Expression of coﬁlin S3A does not affect the exit of NCAM - GFP . S . B . Salvarezza et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 442 tation of the Golgi complex , with a concomitant dispersion of the LIMK1 staining , as expected for a Golgi - associated protein ( data not shown ) . In contrast , both endogenous LIMK2 ( Figure 3D , bottom ) and overexpressed LIMK2 - KD ( Supplemental Figure 2 , bottom ) displayed a homogeneous distribution throughout the cytoplasm . These data strongly suggest that the more drastic inhibition of p75 - GFP TGN exit by LIMK1 - KD than by LIMK2 - KD ( Figure 1B ) depends on the ability of the former to localize at the Golgi apparatus . We suggest that the small effect of overexpressed LIMK2 - KD on p75 - GFP trafﬁcking can be attributed to inefﬁcient com - petition with Golgi - localized LIMK1 for their substrate co - ﬁlin . By contrast , the lack of effect of LIMK2 siRNA on p75GFP exit from TGN ( Figure 3C ) can be attributed to the fact that LIMK2 siRNA should not have any effect on LIMK1 localization or function . Together , our data demonstrate that LIMK1 - mediated activation of its downstream effector coﬁ - lin is strongly spatially restricted . LIMK1 - KD and Coﬁlin S3A Expression Inhibit Tubulation Dynamics of p75 - GFP and Its Segregation from TGN Markers To gain mechanistic understanding of the role of LIMK1 and coﬁlin in cargo exit from the TGN , we next analyzed by high - resolution live imaging the dynamic behavior of p75 - GFP in the TGN after expression of LIMK1 - KD or coﬁlin S3A . We showed previously that p75 - GFP exits the TGN in tubules that rapidly extend and retract under the control of a kinesin motor and eventually undergo dynamin 2 - depen - dent ﬁssion or / and vesiculation ; both tubules and vesicles migrate on linear paths to the plasma membrane , where their fusion can be documented by total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence microscopy ( Kreitzer et al . , 2000 , 2003 ) . Live imaging analysis in control cells demonstrated the presence of many dynamic tubules containing p75 - GFP that extended and retracted from the Golgi complex at a rate of 0 . 25 – 1 Figure 3 . siRNA knockdown of Golgi - localized LIMK1 inhibits exit of p75 - GFP from TGN . ( A ) MDCK cells were electroporated twice at 72 - h intervals with control or canine LIMK1 and LIMK2 siRNA oligonucleotides , respectively , and analyzed 48 h later by immunoblot with antibodies for LIMK - 1 , LIMK - 2 , actin , Ser - 3 - phospho - coﬁlin , and coﬁlin .

LIM Kinase 1 and Coﬁlin Regulate TGN Trafﬁcking Vol . 20 , January 1 , 2009 443 (cid:1) m / s with an average lifetime of 20 s ; many of these tubules underwent vesicular ﬁssion from their tips ( Figure 4A , left , and B ) . By contrast , cells expressing LIMK1 - KD or coﬁlin S3A , displayed swollen and distended Golgi cisternae with long ( 10 – 15 (cid:1) m ) tubular processes displaying much longer lifetimes ( (cid:2) 60 s ) than those of control cells . These tubules did not retract back toward the Golgi ( Figure 4A , right , and B ) and did not generate vesicular carriers at their tips . Dual - color high - resolution imaging ( 1 frame s (cid:7) 1 for 1 min ) of control cells expressing p75 - GFP and ST - mRFP during the ﬁrst 10 min after release from the 20°C block demonstrated that p75 - GFP incorporated into tubules that were devoid of ST - mRFP ( Figure 4C , left , arrows ; see Supplemental Movie 1 ) . In striking contrast , cells overexpressing LIMK1 - KD or coﬁlin S3A displayed tubules containing either ST - mRFP alone ( 53 and 11 % , respectively ) or ST - mRFP plus p75 - GFP ( 15 – 16 % ) , with a dramatic reduction in the number of tu - bules containing only p75 - GFP ( Figure 4C , center and right panels ; see Supplemental Movies 2 and 3 and quantiﬁcation in Figure 4D ) . Many of these tubules displayed p75 - GFP swellings ( Figure 4C , asterisks ) . Consistent with these observations , we observed a drastic decrease in the number of post - Golgi carriers for p75 - GFP . When examined 10 min after release of the 20°C block , control cells exhibited numerous post - Golgi carriers for p75 - GFP , identiﬁed as structures devoid of ST - mRFP moving toward the cell periphery with speeds of (cid:4) 0 . 5 (cid:1) m / s , ( Jaulin et al . , 2007 ) . By contrast cells treated with LIMK1 - KD or coﬁlin S3A displayed a 90 % reduction in the number of such carriers ( Figure 4E and Supplemental Movies 4 and 5 , quan - tiﬁcation in right bar graph ) . The number of cytoplasmic carriers decreased in control cells 60 min after release of the 20°C temperature block , correlating with arrival of the pro - tein to the cell surface , whereas they remained constant or slightly increased , respectively , in cells overexpressing LIMK1 - KD or coﬁlin S3A ( Figure 4E ) . Together , our results demonstrate that decreased LIMK function or increased co - ﬁlin activity lead to a dramatic decrease in the dynamics and ﬁssion of tubules that contain p75 - GFP , resulting in a de - crease in the number of post - Golgi carriers released into the cytoplasm . Cooperation between LIMK1 and Dynamin 2 in Vesicle Fission from the TGN Previous work by our laboratory ( Kreitzer et al . , 2000 ) and by others ( Bonazzi et al . , 2005 ) has shown that GTPase - deﬁcient dynamin blocks exit of P75 - GFP from the TGN by preventing ﬁssion of tubular transporters from the TGN , an effect strikingly similar to that observed in cells expressing LIMK1 - KD and coﬁlin S3A ( Figure 4 ) . In contrast , it has been shown that recruitment of dynamin to the Golgi is depen - dent on actin and cortactin ( Cao et al . , 2005 ) , as well as on syndapin 2 ( Kessels et al . , 2006 ) . A unifying interpretation of these data are that the role of LIMK in the TGN is to promote the assembly of a population of actin ﬁlaments that are required for generation and dynamin - mediated ﬁssion of post - Golgi carriers for p75 . A similar mechanism has been postulated for dynamin’s regulation of endocytosis at the level of the plasma membrane ( Qualmann et al . , 2000 ; Con - ner and Schmid , 2003 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ) , and actin might be required to provide the required tension in dynamin - depen - dent ﬁssion ( Merriﬁeld et al . , 2005 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ) . Such a scenario raised the possibility that LIMK1 might be acting upstream of dynamin 2 and that LIMK1 - KD overex - pression might therefore inhibit the stimulatory effect of dynamin on p75 - GFP exit from the TGN . Indeed , overexpression of wild - type dynamin 2 increased the number of post - Golgi carriers carrying p75 - GFP relative to control cells ( Figure 5A ) , as expected . Importantly , this stimulation was prevented by coexpression of LIMK1 - KD ( Figure 5A ) . The recruitment of dynamin 2 to the Golgi is partially dependent on its proline - rich domain ( PRD ) . We found that overexpression of a truncated dynamin 2 that lacked the PRD ( Dyn2 (cid:9) PRD ) , or overexpression of dy - namin’s 2 PRD alone ( Dyn2 - PRD ) ( Cao et al . , 2005 ) mim - icked the inhibitory effect of LIMK1 - KD on the exit of p75 - GFP from the TGN albeit to a much smaller extent ( Figures 1B and 5B ) . Quantitative analysis of ﬂuorescent images showed that expression of LIMK1 - KD decreased signiﬁ - cantly the levels of endogenous dynamin 2 and overex - pressed Dynamin 2bb - GFP at the Golgi ( Figure 5C , left ) . The accompanying micrographs ( Figure 5C , right ) show an ex - ample of the higher recruitment of Dynamin 2 ( bottom ) at the Golgi complex ( ST - mRFP ; Figure 5C , middle ) of control cells ( asterisks , top ) relative to LIMK 1 KD expressing cells . Together , our results are consistent with the possibility that LIMK1 and dynamin 2 cooperate in mediating ﬁssion of p75 - GFP carriers from the TGN . Given that the effects of LIMK1 - KD or actin depolymerization by cytochalasin D ( see below ) on Golgi exit are larger than the effects on dynamin 2 recruitment , the results suggest that actin plays a struc - tural role in facilitating the function of dynamin , rather than a primary role in its recruitment . Furthermore , there may be overlapping mechanisms responsible for dynamin 2 recruit - ment . As a next step , we focused on two actin regulatory pro - teins that bind the PRD of dynamin , syndapin 2 and cortac - tin . These proteins form Golgi complexes with dynamin 2 via their SH3 domains ( Cao et al . , 2005 ; Kessels et al . , 2006 ) and may be expected to regulate Golgi trafﬁcking via their interactions with the actin cytoskeleton in the vicinity of this organelle ( Qualmann and Kelly , 2000 , Cao et al . , 2003 ; Kessels et al . , 2006 ) . Overexpression of LIMK1 - KD decreased the levels of syndapin 2 and cortactin at the Golgi ( Figure 5D ) . Furthermore , the overexpression of a truncated form of cortactin lacking 50 amino acids of the Src homology ( SH ) 3 domain ( Cort (cid:9) SH3 ) or of the SH3 domain of syndapin ( syn - dapin 2 SH3 ) strongly inhibited the Golgi exit of p75 - GFP ( Figure 5E ) . Interestingly , the truncated form of cortactin did not inhibit the Golgi exit of NCAM ( Supplemental Figure 3 ) . Together with the observed effects for Dyn2 (cid:9) PRD and Dyn2 - PRD described above , these experiments suggest that syndapin 2 and cortactin cooperate with dynamin 2 and LIMK1 to promote Golgi exit of p75 - GFP . It is likely that , in addition to promoting dynamin 2 recruitment , syndapin 2 might independently facilitate p75 exit from TGN by pro - moting the formation of tubular carriers via its BAR domain . Additional work is necessary to understand the nature of the linkages between syndapin , cortactin , and dynamin that regulate Golgi trafﬁcking . TGN - trafﬁcking Effects of LIMK1 - KD and Coﬁlin S3A on p75 - GFP Are Consistent with Increased Local Actin Filament Depolymerization All conditions we found that inhibit p75 - GFP exit from the TGN , i . e . , overexpression of LIMK1 - KD or coﬁlin S3A , as well as LIMK1 siRNA , are consistent with a local increase in coﬁlin activity . Coﬁlin severs actin ﬁlaments and generates new free barbed ends ; it is generally believed that this leads to increased ﬁlament turnover ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Lappa - lainen and Drubin , 1997 ; Arber et al . , 1998 ) . However , during cell migration , local increases in coﬁlin activity may lead to actin ﬁlament formation ( Ghosh et al . , 2004 ) . Hence , we used S . B . Salvarezza et al .

Control : note the exclusion of ST - mRFP from tubules LIM Kinase 1 and Coﬁlin Regulate TGN Trafﬁcking Vol . 20 , January 1 , 2009 445 two independent approaches to determine whether the traf - ﬁcking effects caused by increased coﬁlin activity at the Golgi level might be mediated by increased actin ﬁlament polymerization or depolymerization . As a ﬁrst approach , we investigated whether the effect of LIMK1 - KD and coﬁlin S3A mimicked the effect of stimula - tors or inhibitors of actin ﬁlament disassembly , e . g . , cytocha - lasin D or jasplakinolide , respectively . Actin immunoﬂuo - rescence and phalloidin staining demonstrated that expression of LIMK1 - KD or coﬁlin S3A , like cytochalasin D , disrupted the delicate organization of actin ﬁlaments in the perinuclear region resulting in the accumulation of small actin aggregates ; jasplakinolide , instead , induced the forma - tion of large perinuclear actin aggregates , as previously described ( Spector et al . , 1999 ) ( Figure 6 A and B , top ; and Supplemental Figure 4C ) . Importantly , cytochalasin D ( Fig - ure 6A ) but not jasplakinolide ( Figure 6B ) strongly inhibited the exit of p75 - GFP from the TGN , conﬁrming our previous report that latrunculin B delays the TGN exit of p75 - GFP during the ﬁrst 30 min after release of the 20°C transport block ( Musch et al . , 2001 ) . For the experiments reported here , we used cytochalasin D because it did not promote cell detachment during the 5 h required to measure p75 - GFP exit , unlike latrunculin B . Interestingly , cytochalasin D in - duced the formation of long TGN tubules labeled with ST - mRFP ( Supplemental Figure 4B ) similar to those we ob - served in cells overexpressing LIMK1 - KD or coﬁlin S3A ( Figure 4 , A – C ) . These results are consistent with the hy - pothesis that the effects of LIMK1 - KD and Coﬁlin S3A on Figure 4 ( cont ) . containing p75 - GFP ( arrows , base marked by ar - rowhead ) .

LIM Kinase 1 and Coﬁlin Regulate TGN Trafﬁcking Vol . 20 , January 1 , 2009 447 post - Golgi trafﬁcking of p75 - GFP are mediated by increased actin ﬁlament disassembly . As a second test of whether coﬁlin S3A promotes or inhibits actin ﬁlament disassembly at the Golgi , we mea - sured local actin dynamics in the Golgi area under various experimental conditions . To this end , we generated an MDCK cell line that expresses actin linked to actin - paGFP ( Patterson and Lippincott - Schwartz , 2002 ) . Actin - paGFP in - corporated into stress ﬁbers and actin ﬁlaments at the level of the Golgi that were altered by treatment with actin - toxic drugs similarly as endogenous actin ( Supplemental Figure 4C ) . We activated paGFP in the Golgi area deﬁned by ST - mRFP , with laser illumination at 405 nm under examination by a confocal microscope and then measured the decay of GFP ﬂuorescence as an indicator of actin dynamics in that region ( see Materials and Methods ) ( Figure 6C ) . The decay of actin - GFP ﬂuorescence in the Golgi area correlated with the progressive appearance of GFP ﬂuorescence in regions of the cytoplasm away from the Golgi area , which is compat - ible with actin diffusion rather than with GFP photobleach - ing ( Figure 6C ) . In control cells , this decay exhibited a fast component ( t 1 / 2 (cid:5) 22 s ) and a slow component ( t 1 / 2 (cid:5) 54 s ) , which we presumed corresponded , respectively , to the dif - fusion of free actin monomer pool and actin ﬁlament turn - over in the Golgi area ( Figure 6D , black line ) ( McGrath et al . , 1998 ) . On treatment with jasplakinolide , the diffusion of actin - GFP was dramatically blocked ( Figure 6D , green line ) . By contrast , treatment with latrunculin B ( Figure 6D , red line ) and with coﬁlin S3A ( Figure 6D , blue line ) signiﬁcantly decreased the half - life of decay of the slow component com - pared with control cells ( t 1 / 2 (cid:5) 34 s and t 1 / 2 (cid:5) 41 s , respec - tively ; both p (cid:8) 0 . 001 ) . These results strongly suggest that increased coﬁlin activity promotes increased actin ﬁlament turnover at the Golgi level . Thus , two independent experimental approaches are con - sistent with a scenario in which inhibition of LIMK1 activity at the Golgi region and the consequent activation of coﬁlin , the only established physiological substrate of LIMK1 ( Ar - ber et al . , 1998 , Bernard , 2007 ) , increases local actin ﬁlament disassembly , which in turn delays the exit of p75 - GFP from the TGN . These observations and our previous experiments suggest that the normal role of Golgi LIMK1 is to slow - down coﬁlin - dependent actin turnover to maintain a population of actin ﬁlaments required for dynamin 2 - mediated ﬁssion from the TGN . DISCUSSION Our results demonstrate an important new function of LIMK1 and its substrate coﬁlin in regulating protein traf - ﬁcking at the Golgi apparatus . This trafﬁcking role is highly selective for a subgroup of apical PM proteins that currently includes p75 and the related protein NHR2 ( Figures 1 and 2 ) and is enhanced by the ability of LIMK1 , not shared by LIMK2 , to bind Golgi membranes ( Figure 3 , D and E ) . High - resolution live imaging experiments demonstrated that decreased LIMK1 activity or increased coﬁlin function dra - matically disrupted the formation of tubular precursors to post - Golgi carriers for p75 - GFP ( Figure 4 , A and B ) , the segregation of p75 - GFP from TGN resident proteins ( Figure 4 , C and D ) , and the release of p75 - GFP carriers into the cytoplasm ( Figure 4E ) . A model summarizing our observa - tions on the various molecules involved in p75 vesicular release from the TGN is represented in Figure 7 . Our experiments also suggest a subtle cooperation be - tween LIMK , dynamin 2 , and the dynamin - interacting pro - teins cortactin and syndapin 2 in p75 - GFP carrier vesicle ﬁssion from the TGN . First , overexpression of wild - type dynamin 2 resulted in increased numbers of p75 - GFP carrier vesicles released into the cytoplasm but this effect was sup - pressed by coexpression of LIMK1 - KD ( Figure 5A ) , in part by decreasing the recruitment of endogenous dynamin 2 to the Golgi ( Figure 5C ) . Second , overexpression of a cortactin mutant that effectively binds actin ﬁlaments but cannot in - teract with dynamin 2 disrupted p75 carrier formation ( Fig - ure 5E ) , in agreement with recent observations by Cao et al . ( 2005 ) , demonstrating a role of actin and cortactin in recruit - ing dynamin 2 to the Golgi . Third , we found that overex - pression of syndapin 2’s SH3 domain ( which binds dy - namin’s PRD ) , or of dynamin’s PRD , inhibited p75 vesicle Figure 7 . Model . LIMK1 and coﬁlin regulate a peri - TGN actin ﬁlament network required for the dynamin - dependent exit of p75 - GFP . ( 1 ) A population of actin ﬁlaments , anchored to the TGN by an ARF - dependent mechanism ( Percival et al . , 2004 ; Cao et al . , 2005 ) and reg - ulated by coﬁlin and Golgi anchored LIMK1 , which inactivates coﬁlin locally ( Rosso et al . , 2004 ; this study ) facilitates the initial assembly of transporters for p75 - GFP in cooperation with a plus - end – directed kinesin ( Jaulin et al . , 2007 ) . Note that Golgi markers are excluded from these transporters . ( 2 ) p75GFP - contain - ing tubules extend along MT drawn by a ki - nesin motor ; syndapin 2 , via its BAR - domain , binds to the membrane curvature of the Golgi ( Kessels et al . , 2006 ) and facilitates membrane remodeling necessary for tubulation . ( 3 ) p75 - GFP tubules undergo ﬁssion from the TGN or into smaller transport vesicles ; this process depends on actin ﬁlaments ( regulated by LIMK 1 - coﬁlin ) , which recruit cortactin , as well as syndapin 2 . These two molecules recruit dynamin 2 via their SH3 domains and dynamin PRD ( Cao et al . , 2005 ; Kessels et al . , 2006 ) . ( 4 ) After dynamin - mediated ﬁssion , tubular and vesicular carriers for p75 - GFP are transported by a plus - end kinesin along MT to the plasma membrane . ( 5 ) Inactivation of LIMK1 or overexpression of constitutively activated coﬁlin inhibits the segregation of p75 from TGN markers . ( 6 ) This treatment also inhibits dynamin - mediated ﬁssion of p75 transporters from TGN as well as the recruitment of Dynamin 2 , syndapin 2 , and cortactin to the Golgi . S . B . Salvarezza et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 448 release from the TGN ( Figure 5 , E and B ) . One possibility to explain these effects is a disruption of syndapin 2 / dynamin 2 complexes , which support dynamin’s functions and pro - vide functional coupling of dynamin to actin ﬁlament for - mation ( Kessels et al . , 2006 ) . That the coupling between syndapin’s SH3 domain and dynamin 2’s PRD might be required for p75 post - Golgi carrier formation is also sup - ported by our observation that overexpression of mutant dynamin 2 lacking just the PRD , i . e . , with intact GTPase and oligomerization domains , also inhibited p75 - GFP trafﬁcking . Future experiments should test speciﬁcally whether syn - dapin 2’s requirement for p75 exit from the TGN is solely explained by its participation in the recruitment of dynamin 2 or may also reﬂect its participation in the bending of TGN membranes via its BAR domain to form tubular carriers characteristic for p75 transport . The key link between our trafﬁcking observations with LIMK1 / coﬁlin and with dynamin 2 / syndapin 2 / cortactin is actin . Experiments with actin toxins suggested that the traf - ﬁcking effects of LIMK1 - KD or coﬁlin S3A we observed were due to increased depolymerization of peri - Golgi actin ﬁla - ments ( Figure 6 , A and B ) , in agreement with a recent report ( Lazaro - Dieguez et al . , 2007 ) . This was rigorously conﬁrmed by direct measurement of actin dynamics in the Golgi region using an MDCK cell line that expresses actin - paGFP ( Figure 6 , C and D ) . Actin - GFP is a good probe to study actin dynamics , as it has been used to study the role of actin dynamics in endocytosis and cell – cell adhesion ( Yamada et al . , 2005 ; Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ) . We found that the diffusion rate of Golgi actin - paGFP ( D (cid:4) 1 . 7 (cid:1) 10 (cid:7) 9 cm 2 s (cid:7) 1 in control cells ) was signiﬁcantly enhanced in the presence of either coﬁlin S3A ( D (cid:4) 2 . 1 (cid:1) 10 (cid:7) 9 cm 2 s (cid:7) 1 ) or latrunculin B ( D (cid:4) 2 . 6 (cid:1) 10 (cid:7) 9 cm 2 s (cid:7) 1 ) : our control values are compa - rable with previously reported data obtained using ﬂuores - cence photobleaching recovery ( Kreis et al . , 1982 ) . Together , our experiments strongly suggest that the normal role of Golgi LIMK1 is to maintain an ideal coﬁlin activity level to maintain a population of actin ﬁlaments ( Percival et al . , 2004 ) required for dynamin mediated , cortactin / syndapin 2 - sup - ported trafﬁcking of selected PM cargo proteins out of the TGN . Cdc42 is known to localize throughout the Golgi stack ( Matas et al . , 2004 ) , whereas our experiments indicate that LIMK1 localizes to the TGN ( Figure 3 , D and E ; data not shown ) . Furthermore , it has been shown that PAK4 , a novel effector for cdc42 , localizes to the Golgi complex ( Abo et al . , 1998 ) , and stimulates LIMK1’s ability to phosphorylate co - ﬁlin ( Dan et al . , 2001 ) . Together , these observations raise the possibility that cdc42 and LIMK1 cooperate in post - Golgi transport at the TGN , similarly to the cooperation between cdc42 and N - WASP in Golgi – ER transport at the cis - Golgi ( Luna et al . , 2002 ) . Our results clearly advance the trafﬁcking ﬁeld in several novel areas beyond the previous study by Rosso et al . ( 2004 ) . First , we conclusively showed that the trafﬁcking role of LIMK1 takes place at the Golgi level , by excluding possible effects on protein synthesis or ER – Golgi transport , and by showing directly that inhibition of LIMK1 function de - creases the kinetics of Golgi exit of PM markers . Second , we showed that the speciﬁc trafﬁcking role of LIMK1 - coﬁlin was on the ﬁssion of carrier vesicles from the TGN ( Figure 4 ) . Third , we demonstrated a possible cooperation between LIMK1 and dynamin 2 in this ﬁssion process ( Figure 5 ) . Fourth , we further characterized this ﬁssion mechanism by demonstrating that syndapin 2 and cortactin mutants mimic the effect of LIMK1 - KD in the Golgi exit of p75 - GFP . Fifth , we characterized the actin dynamics at the Golgi region using actin coupled to photoactivatable GFP . This approach allowed us to conclusively show that LIMK1 - coﬁlin increase the dynamics of actin depolymerization at the Golgi , thus eliminating the alternative possibility suggested by Condee - lis ( Ghosh et al . , 2004 ) . Our observations suggest a mecha - nism to generate the population of actin ﬁlaments at the Golgi complex described by Stow and coworkers ( Percival et al . , 2004 ) . In summary , our experiments suggest a model ( Figure 7 ) in which specialized organizations of actin ﬁlaments at the Golgi complex play very speciﬁc roles in promoting the trafﬁcking of groups of PM proteins from the TGN to the PM . It is likely that other specialized actin organizations will play comparable roles in transport routes out of the other major sorting compartment of epithelial cells , common recycling endosomes ( Cancino et al . , 2007 ; Gravotta et al . , 2007 ) . An important objective for the future is to understand how the selectivity of a particular organization of the actin cytoskel - eton for a particular cargo is established . In particular , we want to know how p75 sorting signals , previously deﬁned as the O - glycan cluster in its ectodomin ( Yeaman et al . , 1997 ) upon clustering with galectin 3 ( Delacour et al . , 2007 ) are coupled to the actin regulatory mechanisms required for vesicle ﬁssion . Another major challenge is to identify the mechanisms that couple the actin - dependent ﬁssion mecha - nisms described here with our recent observation that kine - sin 5B is essential for generation and transport of p75 carrier vesicles from Golgi to PM ( Jaulin et al . , 2007 ) . In this regard , it is interesting to mention a recent report that postulates a role for LIMK1 in coordinating MT and actin cytoskeleton function ( Gorovoy et al . , 2005 ) .
