Apte Abstract Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases ( TIMPs ) , which inhibit matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) as well as the closely related , a disintegrin and metalloproteinases ( ADAMs ) and ADAMs with thrombospondin motifs ( ADAMTSs ) , were traditionally thought to control extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteolysis through direct inhibition of MMP - dependent ECM proteolysis . This classical role for TIMPs suggests that increased TIMP levels results in ECM accumulation ( or fibrosis ) , whereas loss of TIMPs leads to enhanced matrix proteolysis . Mice lacking TIMP family members have provided support for such a role ; however , studies with these TIMP deficient mice have also demonstrated that loss of TIMPs can often be associated with an accumulation of ECM . Collectively , these studies suggest that the divergent roles of TIMPs in matrix accumulation and proteolysis , which together can be referred to as ECM turnover , are dependent on the TIMP , specific tissue , and local tissue environment ( i . e . health vs . injury / disease ) . Ultimately , these combined factors dictate the specific metalloproteinases being regulated by a given TIMP , and it is likely the diversity of metalloproteinases and their physiological substrates that determines whether TIMPs inhibit matrix proteolysis or accumulation . In this review , we discuss the evidence for the dichotomous roles of TIMPs in ECM turnover highlighting some of the common findings between different TIMP family members . Importantly , while we now have a better understanding of the role of TIMPs in regulating ECM turnover , much remains to be determined . Data on the specific metalloproteinases inhibited by different TIMPs in vivo remains limited and must be the focus of future studies . © 2015 Published by Elsevier B . V .

Introduction The tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases ( TIMPs ) are tissue specific , endogenous inhibitors of metalloproteinases , including the matrix metallo - proteinases ( MMPs ) as well as the closely related , a disintegrin and metalloproteinases ( ADAMs ) and ADAMs with thrombospondin motifs ( ADAMTSs ) [ 1 – 3 ] . In the current paper , various MMPs and ADAMs will be mentioned as it pertains to the role of the different TIMPs ; however , complete descriptions of these metalloproteinases is beyond the scope of the current paper and can be found in a number of excellent reviews [ 4 – 7 ] . There are four homo - logous members of the TIMP family [ 1 – 3 ] . General - ly , all TIMPs are capable of inhibiting all known MMPs ; however , the efficacy of MMP inhibition varies with each TIMP . For example , TIMP1 is a strong inhibitor of many MMPs except for some of the membrane type ( MT ) - MMPs , including MMP14 , - 15 , - 16 , - 19 , and - 24 [ 1 , 2 ] . As well , both TIMP1 and - 3 associate with latent or pro - MMP9 while TIMP2 , - 3 and - 4 are capable of interaction with pro - MMP2 [ 1 ] . 0022 - 2836 / © 2015 Published by Elsevier B . V .

( 2015 ) 44 – 46 , 247 – 254 Review TIMPs also inhibit ADAMs and ADAMTSs , although , this inhibition is primarily accomplished by TIMP3 . The proteolytic activity of ADAM10 can be inhibited by TIMP1 and - 3 , whereas TIMP3 alone is an efficient inhibitor of ADAMTS4 and - TS5 , which are postulated to cleave aggrecan , a component of cartilage matrix [ 8 – 10 ] . TIMP3 can also inhibit ADAM12S mediated cleavage of insulin - like growth factor binding protein ( IGFBP ) 3 and - 5 [ 11 ] , and TIMP3 , or the N - terminal domain of TIMP3 , specifically inhibits ADAM17 [ 12 , 13 ] . Localization of TIMPs is important in the control of TIMP function . TIMP1 , - 2 , and - 4 were initially thought to be soluble inhibitors , whereas TIMP3 was localized to the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) through interaction with heparan sulfate and other sulfated proteoglycans [ 14 ] . More recently TIMPs have been shown to localize with cell surface proteins ; however , this interaction has primarily been associated with metalloproteinase - indepen - dent functions for the various TIMPs and as yet , has not been found to impact ECM turnover [ 15 – 19 ] . For instance , TIMP1 has been shown to mediate angiogenesis through interaction with β 1 integrin and CD63 [ 16 , 17 ] . Additionally , TIMP3 has been shown to antagonize vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) signaling by binding directly to the VEGF receptor [ 18 , 19 ] . Initial evidence for the role of TIMPs in ECM proteolysis was the ability of TIMPs to inhibit various MMPs in vitro and the association of increased expression of TIMPs with an accumulation of matrix ( i . e . lung fibrosis ) [ 20 ] . Ultimately , this belief led to the generally accepted idea that the balance between MMPs and TIMPs was responsible for ECM proteolysis , and that a shift in the balance in favor of MMPs resulted in increased ECM proteolysis , whereas a shift in the balance in favor of TIMPs resulted in protection of the ECM and decreased proteolysis . Importantly , examination of the phenotypes of mice lacking different TIMPs demonstrated that TIMPs have many different roles , one of which is directly regulating ECM proteolysis ( Fig . 1 ) . It has become apparent , however , that the balance between metalloproteinases and TIMPs controls much more than simply ECM proteolysis . In fact , studies using mice genetically deficient for different metalloproteinases or TIMPs have demon - strated that metalloproteinases process many bio - logically active proteins , including cytokines , chemokines , and cell surface proteins [ 7 , 21 ] . Fur - thermore , regulation of these biologically active proteins by the metalloproteinase / TIMP axis has an indirect effect on matrix turnover in many instances . For example , altered transforming growth factor ( TGF ) β signaling , inflammation , or the number of myofibroblast - like cells all potentially alter ECM turnover leading to increased ECM deposition , and all of these process have been found to be controlled by TIMPs ( Fig . 1 ) . Collectively , these findings suggest that TIMPs can both directly inhibit ECM proteolysis as well as indirectly control ECM turnover and that the specific roles for each TIMP is likely dependent on the metalloproteinases inhibited by the given TIMP within a specific , local tissue environment ( i . e . health vs . injury / disease ; Table 1 ; Fig . 1 ) . The subsequent sections will describe the evidence for each of the TIMPs in direct inhibition of ECM proteolysis as well as indirect regulation of ECM turnover . TIMP1 Direct Inhibition of ECM proteolysis by TIMP1 Many pathological conditions , including the forma - tion of scar tissue , pulmonary fibrosis and diabetic nephropathy , are associated with excessive deposi - tion of ECM components leading to fibrosis [ 22 – 24 ] . Interestingly , TIMP1 expression is increased within these profibrotic environments , which suggests a role for TIMP1 in restricting ECM proteolysis . For example , TIMP1 expression is increased in mesan - gial cells treated with recombinant human connec - tive tissue growth factor in conjunction with high glucose concentrations , which replicates the condi - tions causing diabetic nephropathy [ 24 ] . This in - crease in TIMP1 is associated with a significant reduction in the matrix degradative capacity of mesangial cells , and the addition of a TIMP1 neutralizing antibody abolishes this reduction in the matrix degradative capacity [ 24 ] . Mice lacking TIMP1 ( Timp1 − / − mice ) have provid - ed additional evidence supporting the role of TIMP1 in control of ECM proteolysis within the cardiovas - cular system . Timp1 − / − mice exhibit increased left ventricular wall stress due to decreased myocardial fibrillar collagen content as discovered by compar - ative endocardiographic studies , suggesting TIMP1 plays a role in the preservation of normal myocardial structure and function [ 25 ] . Furthermore , when fed an atherogenic Western - type diet , Timp1 − / − mice crossed with apolipoprotein E knockout ( apoEO ) mice exhibited a greater number of abdominal aortic aneurysms , characterized by infiltrated macro - phages and extensively fragmented elastic lamellae , compared to that of apoEO mice alone [ 26 ] . Such gelatinolytic activity present at the site of the aortic rupture was eliminated with the addition of recombi - nant TIMP1 [ 26 ] . Collectively , both the expression studies as well as the functional studies in Timp1 − / − mice strongly suggest that TIMP1 has the ability to attenuate degradation of the extracellular matrix in healthy tissues as well as under pathological conditions . 248 The role of TIMPs in regulation of extracellular matrix proteolysis Indirect regulation of ECM turnover by TIMP1 Based on the increased expression of Timp1 in pulmonary fibrosis , one would predict that TIMP1 attenuates ECM turnover [ 27 ] . However , induction of lung fibrosis in mice lacking TIMP1 ( Timp1 − / − mice ) reveals that Timp1 − / − mice have similar severity of fibrosis as wild type mice following lung injury [ 28 ] . Interestingly , while fibrosis was similar between wild type and Timp1 − / − mice , inflammation was significantly increased in Timp1 − / − mice suggesting that TIMP1 has a key role in restricting inflammation following lung injury [ 28 ] . This enhanced inflamma - tion may have contributed to the fibrosis observed in these mice . Examination of liver fibrosis following injury revealed a similar role for TIMP1 in the liver . Timp1 − / − mice had significantly increased injury , inflammation , and fibrosis following carbon tetrachloride - induced liver injury compared to wild type mice [ 29 ] . Thus , these studies support a role for TIMP1 in restricting both inflammation and ECM accumulation / fibrosis follow - ing injury . TIMP2 Direct inhibition of ECM proteolysis by TIMP2 Multiple studies provide evidence supporting a role for TIMP2 in inhibition of ECM proteolysis in several tissues , although many of these studies are correlative in nature . For instance , correlative data supports a role for TIMP2 in protecting the ECM from proteolysis in fracture healing [ 30 ] , keloids [ 31 ] , liver [ 32 , 33 ] , kidneys [ 34 , 35 ] , Dupuytren ' s contracture [ 36 , 37 ] , and in heart tissues [ 38 – 42 ] . As a specific example , patients suffering from Dupuytren ' s contracture , a disease caused by excessive ECM deposition leading to fixed flexion of joints in the hand , have a disruption in the balance between TIMP2 and MMP2 in favor of TIMP2 , which suggests that increased TIMP2 is associated with pathophys - iological ECM accumulation [ 36 , 37 ] . Deposition of excess ECM is also a key patho - physiological feature of heart disease . Interestingly , the ECM sparing role for TIMP2 appears to be Fig . 1 . The diverse functions of TIMPs in regulating matrix turnover are dependent on the TIMP , the specific tissue and local tissue environment , as well as the specific metalloproteinases being regulated by a given TIMP . ( A ) TIMPs are known to regulate metalloproteinase activity within the ECM thereby directly inhibiting ECM proteolysis . ( B ) TGF β is sequestered within the ECM and can be released and activated by metalloproteinase activity . This release of TGF β subsequently leads to increased ECM deposition by stromal cells leading to fibrosis . Inhibition of metalloproteinases by TIMPs restricts TGF β activation thereby decreasing ECM deposition . ( C ) Modulation of cell - surface cytokines and cytokine receptors by metalloproteinases can lead to increased inflammation ( i . e . neutrophil chemotaxis ) . TIMP activity can inhibit shedding of these cell surface proteins , and as a result , indirectly regulate ECM turnover through control of inflammation . 249 The role of TIMPs in regulation of extracellular matrix proteolysis dependent on the model of injury with TIMP2 having distinct roles in different models of heart disease . Following transverse aortic constriction , Timp2 mRNA levels decreased in mice lacking the tran - scriptional regulator p8 , and this decrease was associated with reduced collagen deposition [ 38 ] . Furthermore , following induction of myocardial in - farction in mice lacking TIMP2 ( Timp2 − / − mice ) , heart tissue was found to have less dense and more disorganized fibrillar collagen [ 43 ] . This adverse ECM remodeling was found to be due to greater MMP14 activity , which supports a role for TIMP2 in regulation of ECM proteolysis through inhibition of MMP14 [ 43 ] . Indirect regulation of ECM turnover by TIMP2 TIMP2 directly inhibits metalloproteinases , including MMP2 , but TIMP2 is also known to be required for activation of MMP2 through association with MMP14 [ 44 ] . While MMP2 is thought to have a role in degrading the ECM , increased MMP2 activity has also been associated with increased fibrosis due to inflammation in models of recurrent lung injury [ 45 ] . Furthermore , studies by Kandalam and colleagues found that cardiac repair following transverse aortic constriction was impaired in Timp2 − / − mice [ 46 ] . This persistent injury in mice lacking TIMP2 was associ - ated with increased fibrosis due to elevated collagen fiber stability resulting from higher levels of SPARC ( secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine ) [ 46 ] . Collectively , these studies provide evidence that TIMP2 may act to indirectly control ECM abundance , in some cases through activation of MMP2 . TIMP3 Direct Inhibition of ECM proteolysis by TIMP3 TIMP3 has been demonstrated to have many different functions including regulation of inflamma - tion through inhibition of ADAM17 [ 47 ] . There is strong correlative and functional evidence , however , suggesting that TIMP3 is a key inhibitor of ECM remodeling . For example , the highly controlled process of embryo implantation relies heavily on ECM degradation by MMPs [ 48 ] . Specifically , trophoblast cells , which form the outer layer of the implanting blastocyst , express Mmp9 , while mater - nal uterine cells express Timp3 [ 48 ] . The presence of various amounts of exogenous TIMP3 within an extracellular matrix gel incubated with blastocysts resulted in a dose - dependent reduction in extracel - lular matrix degradation , illustrating the critical role of TIMP3 in regulating uterine ECM degradation during embryo implantation [ 48 ] .

In mice lacking TIMP3 ( Timp3 − / − mice ) , metalloproteinase activity is increased in the lungs during development leading to a significant reduction in fibronectin abundance and consequently , impaired branching of the bronchiole tree compared to lungs from wild type mice . Importantly , treatment with GM6001 ( both in whole organ culture or in vivo in pregnant mice ) rescues the enhanced degradation of fibronectin and the impaired bronchiole branching in Timp3 − / − lungs [ 49 , 50 ] . Metalloproteinase activity is increased in the lungs of adult Timp3 − / − mice as well , and this increase is also associated with increased ECM degradation , specifically collagen and fibronectin degradation [ 51 , 52 ] . Furthermore , the increased me - talloproteinase activity and enhanced ECM remodeling observed in the lungs of Timp3 − / − mice is also associated with decreased lung function and increased lung compliance , and is exacerbated in models of sepsis [ 52 , 53 ] . The hind - limb joints of Timp3 − / − mice also possess significantly reduced amounts of articular cartilage exhibited by extensive cleavage of collagen and aggrecan due to increased MMP and ADAMTS activity , which suggests that decreased expression of TIMP3 may play a pathophysiologic role in the development of osteoarthritis [ 54 ] . Additionally , studies have shown that mice lacking TIMP3 experience accelerated mammary gland involution characterized by earlier fragmentation of fibronectin due to increased gelatinase activity [ 55 ] . These events , however , are rescued with the biochemical reconstitution of recombinant TIMP3 [ 55 ] . Finally , TIMP3 deficiency has been shown to lead to maladaptive cardiovascular ECM remodeling following models of myocardial infarction or hyper - tension [ 56 , 57 ] . Following ligation of the coronary artery , Timp3 − / − mice exhibit accelerated left ventricular systolic dysfunction compared to wild type littermates , coupled with increased gelatinase activity and reduced myocardial collagen content [ 56 ] . Following angiotensin - II - induced hypertension , mesenteric and carotid arteries from Timp3 − / − mice have increased gelatinolytic and elastolytic activity as well as suppressed collagen and elastin content vs . arteries from wild type mice , which are rescued by treatment with doxycycline , an MMP inhibitor [ 57 ] . Collectively , these studies support a key role for TIMP3 in regulating ECM proteolysis in both healthy tissue and disease , thereby controlling tissue struc - ture and function . Indirect regulation of ECM turnover by TIMP3 In many healthy tissues , such as the lung , heart and bone , TIMP3 has been found to restrict ECM proteolysis . Interestingly , following injury , the role for TIMP3 with respect to the ECM becomes more complex . For example , in mice lacking TIMP3 , fibrosis is enhanced following bleomycin - in - duced injury , suggesting that the presence of TIMP3 would actually restrict ECM deposition [ 58 ] . While the mechanism leading to this fibrosis remains to be determined , Timp3 − / − mice have impaired resolution of inflammation following lung injury , which could contribute to the enhanced fibrotic response [ 58 , 59 ] . Studies have revealed similar roles for TIMP3 in both the injured heart and kidney [ 60 – 62 ] . Aortic banding leading to cardiac mechanical stress resulted in increased fibrosis in Timp3 − / − hearts compared to wild type hearts due to enhanced TGF β 1 activation [ 60 ] . Additionally , kidney fibrosis is increased following injury in Timp3 − / − vs . wild type mice due to altered activation of pericytes leading to a shift in pericyte - phenotype to a myofibroblast - like cell [ 61 , 62 ] . Collectively , these studies suggest that TIMP3 potentially mediates fibrosis through multiple pathways , from controlling inflammation to regula - tion of TGF β 1 activation and pericyte phenotype . TIMP4 Direct inhibition of ECM proteolysis by TIMP4 TIMP4 appears to be the least studied of the TIMPs and as such , there are limited publications discussing the role of TIMP4 in regulation of ECM proteolysis . There is , however , correlative data in an array of tissues suggesting that TIMP4 restricts ECM proteol - ysis in the developing lung [ 63 ] , female reproductive tract [ 64 ] , eyes [ 65 ] , and transplanted tissues [ 66 ] . For example , vaginal tissue is a site of constant ECM remodeling due to the shedding and subse - quent thickening of the endometrial lining during the menstrual cycle . Pelvic organ prolapse ( POP ) is thought to be dependent on a lack of ECM deposition and increased ECM destruction leading to a weak - ening of the pelvic floor [ 64 ] . Timp4 expression is significantly lower in patients suffering from POP , which supports a role for TIMP4 in protection of the ECM from increased proteolysis [ 64 ] . Indirect regulation of ECM turnover by TIMP4 While studies examining TIMP4 are limited , there is convincing evidence that , similar to other TIMP family members , TIMP4 also acts to restrict fibrosis . Following myocardial ischemia / reperfusion , ECM remodeling often occurs with an initial fibrotic response followed by ECM turnover . In mice lacking TIMP4 , interstitial fibrosis was enhanced one week following injury compared to wild type mice [ 67 ] . Interestingly , this augmented fibrosis was 251 The role of TIMPs in regulation of extracellular matrix proteolysis associated with greater MMP14 activity as well as increased inflammation , suggesting that TIMP4 regulates ECM deposition through inhibition of MMP14 and restriction of inflammation [ 67 ] . Summary In conclusion , the role of TIMPs in regulating ECM turnover is dichotomous and is likely dependent on the specific metalloproteinase inhibited by the particular TIMP within a given tissue ( Fig . 1 ) . There is certainly strong evidence to support a role for most TIMP family members in inhibition of ECM proteolysis by various MMPs . However , through control of cell function ( e . g . regulation of inflamma - tion , control of the release of TGF β 1 activation , or pericyte phenotype ) , TIMPs are also capable of restricting ECM deposition ultimately leading to a reduction in ECM abundance . While phenotypes vary between TIMP family members , certain gener - alizations can be made . For instance , in healthy tissues , TIMPs appear to spare the ECM from degradation and only following injury / infection do TIMPs appear to indirectly control ECM deposition ( i . e . enhanced fibrosis observed in mice lacking TIMPs following injury ) . Importantly , while we have learned much about the roles of TIMPs in regulating ECM turnover in healthy and injured tissues , there is still much to be determined . Multiple cell types within a given tissue typically express different TIMPs although there is often overlapping expression between different TIMP family members . Further - more , while many in vitro studies have demonstrat - ed inhibition of specific metalloproteinases by different TIMPs , much less is known about the in vivo regulation of metalloproteinase activity . Future work must focus on elucidating the function of multiple TIMPs from specific cell types as well as identifying the specific metalloproteinases inhibited by each TIMP in vivo , which will allow for further clarification of the roles of TIMPs in protecting the ECM from proteolysis vs . restricting deposition of ECM .
