Our experiments suggest that this approach could improve the user’s engagement and optimization performance .

In particular , with the recent development of deep learning techniques , the user is now able to easily and quickly obtain a high - quality image [ 12 ] , 3D shape [ 3 ] , or even melody [ 20 ] by just specifying a latent vector ( i . e . , a set of latent parameters ) of a deep generative model trained for a particular domain . In such parametric content creation scenarios , the user’s task is to search for an appropriate parameter set that produces the desired content . However , this task is not easy since the search space is often high - dimensional . To facilitate this task execution , researchers have investigated user - in - the - loop optimization [ 1 , 5 , 6 , 15 , 25 ] , which is a human - AI collabo - rative process where the system samples candidate solutions , asks the user to provide preferential feedback on them , and iterates this procedure until finding the desired solution . In this work , we investigate a novel approach to enhance this interactive process : allowing the user to control the sampling be - havior . More specifically , we allow the user to explicitly adjust the balance between exploration ( i . e . , favoring diverse samples in the candidate set ) and exploitation ( i . e . , favoring focused samples in the candidate set ) in each iteration . This approach is motivated by a simple model of the creative process ( which is sometimes im - plicitly assumed [ 23 ] ) : the ideation stage comes earlier to obtain serendipitous inspirations , and then the refinement stage comes later to improve the idea . That is , we take the analogy between the exploration - exploitation transition in the sampling strategy and the ideation - refinement transition in the creative process . We consider that the transition is often seamless and non - linear , and content creators purposefully control the balance in manual workflows . Thus , we expect that this additional controllability has the potential to improve user experience with the optimization process . 43 IUI ’21 , April 14 – 17 , 2021 , College Station , TX , USA Yijun Zhou , Yuki Koyama , Masataka Goto , and Takeo Igarashi User System Selectedmelody Candidate melodies Balance for the next candidates Exploitation Exploration Figure 1 : Interactive exploration - exploitation balancing in the search for the desired content in user - in - the - loop opti - mization processes . We allow the user to manually adjust the balance between exploration and exploitation in each it - eration to control the variations of the system - generated candidates . Here , we focus on generative melody composi - tion as the representative task , where the goal is to find an appropriate latent vector that generates the desired melody . To evaluate how this approach affects the user experience and optimization behavior , we implement it into an existing melody composition system [ 28 ] , which combines a deep generative model [ 20 ] with a user - in - the - loop Bayesian optimization ( BO ) technique [ 16 ] . In each iteration , the user can explicitly specify the exploration - exploitation balance via a slider interface , by which the variation in the sampled candidate melodies can be controlled ( Figure 1 ) . We achieve this functionality by adapting the sampling strategy in BO determined by acquisition functions [ 22 ] . We conducted a simulated experiment , suggesting that the optimization performance could benefit from an appropriate balancing , and also conducted a user study with novice composers , suggesting that our approach could improve user engagement and satisfaction and better support their creativity . 2 RELATED WORK Human - in - the - Loop Optimization . Optimization problems often involve human judgment ( e . g . , preference ) in their objectives . In such cases , having humans in the optimization loop can be a promis - ing solution . Interactive evolutionary computation [ 25 ] is one of such approaches investigated for decades . More recently , BO [ 22 ] has been extended for the human - in - the - loop use such that it accepts preferential feedback ( i . e . , given multiple options , the evaluator chooses the most preferable one ) [ 2 ] . Since human - in - the - loop BO is efficient in terms of the number of necessary queries to humans , this approach has been actively investigated [ 1 , 6 , 15 , 16 , 28 ] . While BO can automatically balance exploration and exploitation by using an appropriate acquisition function when sampling new candidate solutions [ 22 ] , no previous work investigates the manual approach to the balance . Our work adds user control over the acquisition function , and we investigate how this control affects the user - in - the - loop optimization process in performance and user experience . Exploration - Exploitation Balancing in Human - Computer Interac - tion . The exploration - exploitation balance and similar concepts have been discussed in various human - computer interaction ( HCI ) contexts . For example , Koch et al . [ 14 ] presented an image recom - mendation system for ideation in designing mood boards , which automatically controls the exploration - exploitation balance to pro - vide reasonable recommendations for ideation . Maudet [ 19 ] sug - gested to design recommendation systems so that they allow the user to manually choose from different recommendation algorithms to switch the priority between “discovery” ( exploration ) and “com - fort” ( exploitation ) . Davis et al . [ 8 ] presented a human - computer co - drawing application , which offers the functionality to manually control the level of “creativity” ( the degree of exploration ) in the system - generated line drawings . Creativity Support Tools for Music Composition . Designing cre - ativity support tools has been a “grand challenge” in HCI [ 11 , 23 ] . We are especially interested in designing effective tools for music content creation [ 10 , 17 , 18 ] . Younker et al . [ 27 ] stated that the standard process of novices to compose music consists of two steps : capturing a vague idea and refining it . Thus , we consider that it is especially important for music content creation tools to allow novice composers to explore and refine their vague ideas in a con - trollable way . We investigate an approach to this direction in the context of generative melody composition . 3 SYSTEM AND INTERACTION OVERVIEW We implement the capability of interactive exploration - exploitation balancing into an existing generative melody composition system for novice composers [ 28 ] . This is a web application consisting of composing and searching modes . The composing mode offers basic functionalities to compose melodies via a piano - roll interface , and the user can toggle the searching mode when necessary . The searching mode ( Figure 2 ) runs the user - in - the - loop BO process [ 16 ] to find an appropriate two - bar melody generated by a pre - trained variational autoencoder ( VAE ) called MusicVAE [ 20 ] . VAE is a variant of autoencoders , whose training is regularized so that the latent space has a smooth probabilistic distribution [ 13 ] . The latent space was reduced beforehand from 512 dimensions to 4 dimensions using another small VAE [ 9 ] so that BO works effectively [ 28 ] ; refer to the previous work [ 28 ] for details . In each iteration of the user - in - the - loop - BO process , the system provides the user with four new candidate melodies sampled by BO and asks the user to select the preferable one . Optionally , the user can edit the selected candidate in the editing widget . Finally , the user specifies the exploration - exploitation balance for the next iteration via a simple slider to control the variety of the next candidates , which is the difference from the previous system [ 28 ] , and then goes to the next iteration . This iteration finishes when the user feels satisfied with the found melody . 4 EXPLORATION - EXPLOITATION BALANCING In BO methods , candidates are determined by an acquisition function [ 22 ] , which evaluates the effectiveness of a candidate as the next query . We denote by a : Z → R an acquisition function , where Z is the search space ( the 4 - dimensional latent space in our case ) . In the simple case of sampling one candidate in each iteration , it is deter - mined as z next = arg max z ∈Z a ( z ) . Sampling multiple candidates in each iteration can be achieved similarly by a simple extension [ 21 ] . There are several acquisition functions that can automatically bal - ance exploration ( i . e . , favor sampling from unvisited regions ) and 44 Interactive Exploration - Exploitation Balancing for Generative Melody Composition IUI ’21 , April 14 – 17 , 2021 , College Station , TX , USA Figure 2 : Interface for the search . ( A ) Current candidate melodies that BO sampled . ( B ) Editing widget . ( C ) Slider for specifying the exploration - exploitation balance for the next iteration . ( D ) Buttons to control the workflow . exploitation ( i . e . , favor sampling from high - expectation regions ) . One of the most popular choices is the expected improvement ( EI ) , which has been used in previous human - in - the - loop BO methods [ 2 , 6 , 15 , 16 , 28 ] . In this work , the balancing mechanism needs to be controllable by the user , which cannot be achieved by EI . Thus , we propose to use another popular acquisition function called Gaussian process upper confidence bound ( GP - UCB ) [ 24 ] . GP - UCB fits our needs since it has a hyperparameter that can be set by the user to directly control the balance . The GP - UCB acquisition function at the i - th iteration is defined as follows . The posterior distribution of the objective value ( i . e . , user’s preference ) at z ( which we denote by f ( z ) ) follows a Gaussian distribution under the Gaussian process prior [ 22 ] , and thus can be written as f ( z ) ∼ N ( µ i ( z ) , σ 2 i ( z ) ) . Then , the GP - UCB value is calculated by a GP - UCB i ( z ) = µ i ( z ) + β 12 i σ i ( z ) ( 1 ) where β i ≥ 0 is a hyperparameter that controls the balance ; a larger value weighs exploration more , and a smaller value weighs exploitation more . In our system , the exploration - exploitation slider is mapped to β i , where the six dots from left to right corresponds to 0 . 0 , 0 . 01 , 0 . 04 , 0 . 16 , 0 . 64 , and 2 . 56 . 5 SIMULATED EXPERIMENT We conducted a simulated experiment to understand the control - lability and performance of our approach , in which user response was simulated artificially . We used soft Dynamic Time Warping ( s - DTW ) [ 7 ] as the metric to measure the dissimilarity between two melodies , following previous work [ 28 ] . In this experiment , we compared five conditions : Automatic ( EI ) , Exploration ( GP - UCB with β = 2 . 56 ) , Intermediate ( GP - UCB with β = 0 . 16 ) , Exploitation ( GP - UCB with β = 0 . 0 ) , and Adaptive ( GP - UCB with an adaptive β ) . The last condition is for simulating the typical user behavior that we expected : increasing β when the current melody is far from the desired one , and vice versa . We set β based on the s - DTW value of the selected one , according to an empirical rule : ( 1 ) s - DTW ≤ 10 . 0 : β = 0 . 0 ; ( 2 ) 10 . 0 < s - DTW ≤ 100 . 0 : β = 0 . 01 ; ( 3 ) 100 . 0 < s - DTW ≤ 300 . 0 : β = 0 . 04 ; ( 4 ) 300 . 0 < 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Iteration 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 s - D T W conditionautomaticexplorationintermediateexploitationadaptive 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Iteration 6 8 10 12 14 E u c li dean d i s t an c e conditionautomaticexplorationintermediateexploitationadaptive Figure 3 : Residuals in the simulated experiment .

These values were selected based on our observation . Each experiment trial was conducted as follows . ( 1 ) Generate a desired melody by randomly sampling on the search space ; ( 2 ) In the t - th iteration ( t = 1 , . . . , 50 ) , select the one with the smallest s - DTW to the desired melody as the preferable one from the candidate melodies . We recorded both s - DTW values and Euclidean distances in the search space as residuals through iterations . We performed 100 trials for each condition . As a result ( Figure 3 ) , we observe that the s - DTW values de - creased as iterations went on in every condition . Among them , Adaptive could approach to the desired melody the most quickly . We also calculated the average s - DTW and Euclidean distance among every possible pair of candidates in each iteration ( Fig - ure 4 ) , which indicates the variety in the candidates . We observe that , in every condition , the values decreased quickly in the first 10 iterations and then became relatively stable , where Exploita - tion was the smallest , Exploration was the largest , and the others stayed intermediate . From these observations , we conclude that GP - UCB can effectively control the variation of candidates , and the Adaptive condition , which simulates the user behavior in our approach , can work efficiently . 6 USER STUDY We conducted a user study to evaluate how effectively our manual method ( i . e . , GP - UCB with user - controllable β s ) can improve user experience and satisfaction in comparison with the auto method ( i . e . , EI ) , which is considered a baseline .

Each participant received a 10 - USD gift card as a reward . Procedure and Task . We conducted the user study in a remote way without face - to - face contact . Each participant was first tutored by the experimenter about the usage and the features of the system ( 5 minutes ) . Then , they were asked to finish two tasks . In each task , they were asked to search for a two - bar melody with either the manual or auto method . In the first iteration , they were asked to select a two - bar melody they preferred from randomly sampled candidates . Then , they were asked to search for their desired two - bar melody based on the selected one in the first iteration . They were also asked to perform at least 25 iterations and finish each task within 10 minutes . Finally , they filled post - study questionnaires and completed a semi - structured interview ( 10 minutes ) . Questionnaires . To evaluate user experience of the creative pro - cess , we used Creativity Support Index ( CSI ) [ 4 ] , which is a standard - ized psychometric tool for assessing the perceived creativity sup - port of a tool . It consists of six factors : enjoyment , exploration , expressiveness , immersion , results worth efforts , and collab - oration . Even though our system does not involve collaboration , we included it as suggested by the original paper [ 4 ] . According to the original paper [ 4 ] , we chose the weighted score for all the paired t - test , which was calculated by multiplying a participant’s factor score by the factor count . The goal is to make the weighted score more sensitive to the factors that are more important consid - ered by the participant . Our questionnaires also included a question that asks the satisfaction score on their melody compositions in a ten - point scale as CSI . Finally , our questionnaires ask the par - ticipants to indicate their preference over the manual and auto methods . Semi - Structured Interview . We conducted a semi - structured in - terview for each participant , focusing on the overall experience , perceived advantages and disadvantages , and the possible improve - ment . In particular , we asked their feeling and experience of using the exploration - exploitation slider , and how this interaction influ - enced their experience . Questionnaires Results . In the results of CSI ( Table 1 ) , the man - ual method outperformed the auto method in all factors , and there is statistical significance in enjoyment ( p < 0 . 01 ) , exploration ( p < 0 . 05 ) , expressiveness ( p < 0 . 01 ) , results worth efforts ( p < 0 . 01 ) , and the overall CSI score ( p < 0 . 01 ) . We can also observe from the counts that the participants considered exploration and expressiveness as important factors in the composition task . The mean satisfaction scores of the manual and auto methods were 8 . 25 ( SD : 0 . 87 ) and 6 . 83 ( SD : 2 . 08 ) , respectively , which shows statis - tical significance ( p = 0 . 041 ) . As for the preference , eleven out of twelve preferred the manual method over the auto method . Interview Results . Nine participants indicated positive feelings of control and engagement when using the manual method as the reason they preferred the manual method : “It makes me feel that I can express my idea to the system as the slider gives me more options and control” ( P9 ) ; “It gives me the opportunity to indicate my own preference , instead of only relying on the machine’s result” ( P12 ) ; and “It’s easier to indicate my desired exploration direction with the slider , which makes the experience more engaging” ( P3 ) . Also , two participants mentioned that the manual method inspired their creativity : “It’s more interesting for me to be able to control the system . The results can be tuned to my idea and which makes me more creative and inspires me with more ideas” ( P6 ) ; and “It’s a great and brand - new experience . During the iterations , I sometimes changed my mind on how the desired melody would be , and the manual method made it possible for me to tell the system” ( P5 ) . 7 DISCUSSION The dimensionality of the search space in our system is four , which we set following previous work [ 28 ] . However , this dimensionality is relatively lower than those of typical deep generative models . Investigating how the exploration - exploitation balancing works in higher - dimensional spaces is an important future work . As for the user interface , the observability is currently limited when the user interacts with the exploration - exploitation slider ; a mechanism to show the impact of the slider value on music generation would help the user understand the interaction flow . While we focused on melody composition as the representative task , parametric de - sign scenarios are very common in various domains , such as photo editing [ 15 , 16 ] and 3D modeling [ 26 ] . We expect that our findings can be applied to those scenarios , but further investigation is nec - essary . Our simulated experiment suggested the effectiveness of the adaptive balancing approach . That is , the performance of BO can be improved if the exploration - exploitation balance is properly controlled . This finding is interesting in both user - in - the - loop and non - user - in - the - loop BO settings , and further analysis is important . 8 CONCLUSION We found that the exploration - exploitation balancing was effective in generative melody composition , a user - in - the - loop optimization problem . Our user study suggested that our approach could enhance the user’s control and engagement , inspire their creativity , and help them express themselves better through the manual control of the 46 Interactive Exploration - Exploitation Balancing for Generative Melody Composition IUI ’21 , April 14 – 17 , 2021 , College Station , TX , USA Table 1 : The results of the creativity support index ( CSI ) in the user study .
