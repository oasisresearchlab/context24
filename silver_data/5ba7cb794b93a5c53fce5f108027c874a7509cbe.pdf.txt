Supporting cognitive walkthrough with video data : a mobile learning evaluation study Catarci , T . ; Kimani , S . ; Gabrielli , S . ; Although expert - based evaluation techniques such as heuristic evaluation and cognitive walkthrough are often inexpensive and quick to apply , they have not proved to be effective in capturing contextual factors that arise in real - world settings . It is no trivial issue to understand how such evaluation techniques could be modified or differently applied so as to better take into account context , without loosing the advantages inherent in those techniques . This paper explores a possible way of addressing the trade - off between application of cognitive walkthrough and low cost improvements of its contextual validity . In particular , we propose and investigate the benefits of supporting cognitive walkthrough with video data about user interaction with an eLearning course on mobile device . Initial results from this study indicated that video data provided evaluators with a more detailed understanding of user characteristics and interaction contexts , leading to an improvement of their assessments in terms of the total number of system ' s flaws detected . Video data was regarded by experts as both relevant and useful , especially for tuning the evaluation focus on types of difficulties they would normally not have experienced because of differences in terms of abilities , knowledge and background with those of the target user group .
