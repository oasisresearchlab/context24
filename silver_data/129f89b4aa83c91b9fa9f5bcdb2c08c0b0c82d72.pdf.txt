Hefegenetik und Gärungstechnologie , Universität Hohenheim , 70599 Stuttgart , Germany 1 corresponding author Abstract The endosomal sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT ) - III mediates budding and abscission of intraluminal vesicles ( ILVs ) into multivesicular endosomes . To further define the role of the ESCRT - III associated protein Mos10 / Vps60 in ILV formation , we screened for new interaction partners by SILAC / MS . Here , we focused on the newly identified interaction partner Vps68 . Our data suggest that Vps68 cooperates with ESCRT - III in ILV formation . The deletion of VPS68 caused a sorting defect similar to the SNF7 deletion , when the cargo load was high . The composition of ESCRT - III was altered , the level of core components was higher and the level of associated proteins was lower in the deletion strain . This suggests that a shift occurs from an active complex to a disassembly competent complex and that this shift is blocked in the ∆vps68 strain . We present evidence that during this shift Snf7 is replaced by Mos10 . Vps68 has an unusual membrane topology . Two of its potential membrane helices are amphipathic helices localized to the luminal side of the endosomal membrane . Based on this membrane topology we propose that Vps68 and ESCRT - III cooperate in the abscission step by weakening the luminal and cytosolic leaflets of the bilayer at the abscission site . Introduction Endosomal sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT ) - III proteins are membrane remodeling factors that are involved in the deformation and abscission of membranes . ESCRT - III participates in a large number of membrane - related cellular processes ( Gatta & Carlton , 2019 ; Hurley , 2015 ; McCullough et al , 2018 ; Vietri et al , 2020 ) . Initially , ESCRT - III proteins were identified in yeast as factors involved in the formation of intraluminal vesicles ( ILVs ) at late endosomes ( Babst et al , 2002 ) . But now it is clear that ESCRT - III proteins are an inherent part of all eukaryotic cells . ESCRT - III proteins are of ancient origin , they were already present in the last common eukaryotic ancestor ( LCEA ) ( Leung et al , 2008 ) . Recent reports indicate that the ESCRT - III function may be even more general and widespread than initially thought . Cryo - EM studies show that the bacterial phage shock protein PspA and the plant chloroplast protein Vipp1 share a common evolutionary origin with ESCRT - III proteins ( Junglas et al , 2021 ; Liu et al , 2021 ) . Most ESCRT - III proteins have the propensity to form filaments . The structure of the ESCRT - III assemblies has been meticulously studied in vitro ( Banjade et 2 al , 2019 ; Bertin et al , 2020 ; Chiaruttini et al , 2015 ; Lee et al , 2015 ; Maity et al , 2019 ; Tang et al , 2015 ) , but how ESCRT - III looks like in vivo is still unclear . If ESCRT - III forms structures similar to PspA and Vipp1 the complex may be less extensive as suggested by the previous in vitro studies . In yeast , the role of ESCRT - III in the formation of intraluminal vesicles ( ILVs ) has been most thoroughly studied . It is thought that the recruitment of ESCRT - III to the endosomal membrane is the final step in a cascade of reactions involving the upstream complexes ESCRT - 0 , - I and - II ( Teis et al , 2008 ) . The common view is that ESCRT - III itself is assembled in a stepwise manner . First , Vps20 is recruited by binding to the ESCRT - II subunit Vps25 , then Snf7 enters and is induced to polymerize . Snf7 polymerization is limited by Vps2 and Vps24 , which finally initiate disassembly of the complex by the AAA - ATPase Vps4 . This view has been challenged recently ( Adell et al , 2017 ; Mierzwa et al , 2017 ) . According to these newer findings , there seems to be a continuous , stochastic exchange of ESCRT - III proteins and Vps4 with sites of ILV formation . Thus , ESCRT - III appears to be far more dynamic than originally thought . The ESCRT - III protein family consists of eight members in yeast and twelve members in mammalian cells . With respect to ILV formation , the ESCRT - III proteins are conventionally divided into two groups , the so - called core subunits Snf7 , Vps2 , Vps20 and Vps24 ( ESCRT - III proper ) and the ESCRT - III associated proteins Did2 , Ist1 and Mos10 / Vps60 ( Azmi et al , 2008 ; Dimaano et al , 2008 ; Rue et al , 2008 ) . The eighth member of the family Chm7 is not involved in ILV formation , but rather plays a separated role at the nuclear membrane ( Bauer et al , 2015 ; Thaller et al , 2019 ) . Our recent data suggest that the distinction between core components and associated ESCRT - III proteins may not be justified ( Heinzle et al , 2019 ) . We think that Did2 and Mos10 are an integral part of ESCRT - III . This view is supported by another study , which investigated the contribution of Did2 and Ist1 to ESCRT - III function ( Pfitzner et al , 2020 ) . There are conflicting reports as to the role of the so - called ESCRT - III associated proteins . In our initial identification and characterization of Mos10 / Vps60 , the MOS10 deletion mutant had a sorting defect indistinguishable from the deletion of other ESCRT - III core subunits ( Kranz et al , 2001 ) . In another report , the MOS10 deletion only showed a sorting effect in combination with deletions of other ESCRT - III associated factors ( Rue et al . , 2008 ) . Recently , at least a partial sorting defect of the MOS10 deletion has been reported in several studies ( Banjade et al , 2021 ; Nickerson et al , 2010 ) . The impact of ESCRT - III deletions on the morphology of multivesicular endosomes was studied by EM tomography ( Nickerson et al . , 2010 ; Nickerson et al , 2006 ) . From these studies , a clear distinction could be made between core subunits and associated proteins . Deletion of core subunits completely prevented ILV formation and led to the accumulation of stacked membrane structures next to the vacuole ( the so - called class E compartments ) ( Raymond et al , 1992 ) . In contrast , deletion of associated factors gave rise to multivesicular endosomes with a vesicular / tubular morphology ( VTEs ) ( Nickerson et al . , 2010 ) . Thus , the associated factors seem to act after the core components . Evidence has been presented that the associated proteins Did2 and Mos10 are involved in the disassembly of ESCRT - III ( Azmi et al . , 2008 ; Dimaano et al . , 2008 ; Rue et al . , 2008 ) . Our interpretation of these findings is that ESCRT - III can exist in different functional states with different compositions . At the beginning 3 of the functional cycle ESCRT - III is actively involved in ILV formation and / or abscission , then after completion of ILV formation , it is converted to a disassembly competent complex . The data presented in this report are in line with this interpretation . To learn more about the function of Mos10 , we looked for new interaction partners by a SILAC / MS screen . Consistently , the ESCRT - III proteins Vps2 , Vps24 , Snf7 and Did2 were co - purified with Mos10 . This strengthens the view that Mos10 is an integral part of ESCRT - III . In addition , several other potential candidates were detected . Here , we focused on one of these interaction partners , the protein Vps68 . Vps68 was first identified in a screen for vacuolar protein sorting ( vps ) mutants that mis - localize carboxypeptidase Y ( Bonangelino et al , 2002 ) . By genome - wide screens , it could be shown that Vps68 localizes to endosomes and that it forms a complex with Vps55 ( Huh et al , 2003 ; Schluter et al , 2008 ) . Here we show that Vps68 physically interacts with ESCRT - III and present evidence that it cooperates with ESCRT - III in ILV formation . Results Screen for Mos10 interacting proteins Although , the ESCRT - III system has been intensively studied , there are only relatively few reports about the role of the human ESCRT - III protein CHMP5 or its yeast counterpart Mos10 / Vps60 . To learn more about the function of Mos10 , we looked for novel Mos10 interaction partners . To this end , Mos10 was purified from yeast cell extracts by affinity chromatography and the co - purified proteins were then identified by mass spectrometry . Purifications were performed with two different tags fused to the Mos10 C - terminus , a 6His - tag and a superfolder - GFP ( sfGFP ) - tag . Mos10 - 6His was functional ( Fig . S6 - 2 ) , while Mos10 - sfGFP gave rise to a block in endocytic trafficking ( Fig . S6 - 3 ) . To filter out unspecific binding , a SILAC ( stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture ) approach was used . The culture expressing tagged Mos10 was grown in medium containing arginine and lysine labeled with heavy isotopes , while the control culture expressing native Mos10 was grown with arginine and lysine with normal , light isotopes . Among the proteins identified by mass spectrometry , we looked for proteins with a high heavy to light ( H / L ) ratio . The results of three different purifications ( two Ni - NTA purifications with the 6His - tag , one with anti - GFP antibodies and the sfGFP - tag ) are summarized in Tab . S1 . We detected 51 proteins that were at least 2 - fold enriched for the heavy isotopes . Two of these proteins ( Bag7 , Ykr075c ) are naturally occurring poly - histidine proteins and are thus most likely unspecific contaminants . The list of potential interaction partners was checked against the CRAPome database ( Mellacheruvu et al , 2013 ) to filter out common contaminants in AP - MS experiments . Proteins detected at least 5 - times in 17 experiments were dismissed as unspecific . The remaining 37 proteins are candidates for further study . The proteins with the highest H / L ratio , which were consistently co - purified in all three experiments , were the ESCRT - III proteins Vps2 , Snf7 , Vps24 and Did2 . This clearly demonstrates that Mos10 is a bona fide member of ESCRT - III , a fact that is still not generally acknowledged . From the list of the remaining proteins , Vps68 was selected for further study . 4 Figure 1 Vps68 binds to ESCRT - III . sfGFP - Vps68 was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts with anti - GFP antibodies . The immunoprecipitates were examined for the presence of ESCRT - III proteins with specific antibodies . Lanes 1 - 4 : Input , lanes 5 - 8 : IP . Lanes 1 , 5 : RKY1558 ( WT ) , lanes 2 , 6 : RKY3285 ( sfGFP - VPS68 ) , lanes 3 , 7 : RKY3394 ( sfGFP - VPS68 ∆mos10 ) , lanes 4 , 8 : RKY3412 ( sfGFP - VPS68 ∆snf7 ) Vps68 binds to ESCRT - III The binding of Vps68 to Mos10 was verified by a co - immunoprecipitation experiment . For detection , Vps68 was tagged with sfGFP at its N - terminus . N - terminally tagged Vps68 proved to be functional , while C - terminally tagged Vps68 was compromised in its function ( Fig . S3 ) . Vps68 was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts with anti - GFP antibodies and examined for co - immunoprecipitation of the ESCRT - III proteins Mos10 , Snf7 and Vps2 ( Fig . 1 ) . In the otherwise wildtype background , all three ESCRT - III proteins could be co - immunoprecipitated by the GFP antibodies . This confirms our MS identification of Vps68 as an interaction partner of Mos10 . We were then interested to know , whether Vps68 is recruited to ESCRT - III by direct binding to Mos10 or whether the interaction is mediated by some other subunit of ESCRT - III . To this end , the co - immunoprecipitation experiment was repeated with a ∆mos10 and a ∆snf7 strain carrying the integrated sfGFP - VPS68 cassette . As can be seen in Fig . 1 , Snf7 and Vps2 could still be precipitated by Vps68 in the ∆mos10 strain . Thus , binding of Vps68 to ESCRT - III does not appear to be mediated by Mos10 . In the ∆snf7 strain , no co - precipitation of any ESCRT - III 5 Figure 2 Membrane accumulation of Snf7 in a MOS10 deletion mutant . Yeast cell extracts of the wildtype RKY1558 ( blue ) and the ∆mos10 strain RKY2909 ( orange ) were fractionated by sucrose density gradient fractionation and analyzed by western blotting .

Left : low density , right : high density . subunit could be observed . This is in line with the observation that Snf7 is absolutely essential for ESCRT - III formation ( Heinzle et al . , 2019 ) , i . e . in ∆snf7 there is no ESCRT - III that could be precipitated by Vps68 . The amount of Snf7 and Vps2 precipitated by Vps68 was twice as high in the ∆mos10 strain compared to wildtype . Thus , ESCRT - III complexes accumulate in the cell , when Mos10 is missing . This is consistent with a role of Mos10 in disassembly of ESCRT - III . This notion was explored further by sucrose density gradient fractionation of cell extracts from a wildtype and from a ∆mos10 strain ( Fig . 2 , Fig . S2 ) . The fractionation profile of Snf7 was compared to the profiles of two marker proteins , Pep12 as a marker for endosomes and ALP as a marker for the vacuole . With wildtype extracts , Pep12 had a peak in fraction 7 and ALP had a peak in fraction 8 . In the ∆mos10 strain , the Pep12 peak was shifted towards fraction 8 , 6 Figure 3 VPS68 deletion stabilizes Ste6 . Gal - depletion experiment . ( A ) Yeast cells were grown on 2 % galactose medium and shifted to 2 % glucose medium at t 0 . Cell extracts from equal culture volumes were prepared at the times indicated and examined for Ste6 by western blotting . ( B ) The western blot signals were quantified by ImageJ ( t 0 = 100 % ) . Ste6 was expressed from the GAL1 promoter . Strains : RKY3319 ( wildtype , blue ) , RKY3320 ( ∆vps68 , orange ) . while the ALP peak was unchanged . With wildtype extracts , most of Snf7 was found at the top of the gradient , where the soluble proteins are localized . A small part migrated into the gradient and formed a small peak in fraction 7 , consistent with an endosomal localization of Snf7 . With ∆mos10 extracts , the membrane associated fraction of Snf7 was markedly higher , with a concomitant reduction of the soluble fraction . This agrees with our co - IP results and shows that Mos10 is involved in the disassembly of ESCRT - III . Vps68 is involved in the sorting of the endocytic cargo protein Ste6 Vps68 has been identified previously as a protein involved in the trafficking of proteins to the yeast vacuole ( Bonangelino et al . , 2002 ; Huh et al . , 2003 ; Schluter et al . , 2008 ) . To further 7 Figure 4 Influence of VPS68 deletion on Ste6 - GFP localization . Different yeast strains were transformed with the Ste6 - GFP plasmid pRK599 . The localization of Ste6 - GFP was examined by fluorescence microscopy . Strains ( from top to bottom ) : RKY1558 ( WT ) , RKY3222 ( ∆vps68 , low expression level of Ste6 - GFP ) , RKY3222 ( ∆vps68 , high expression level of Ste6 - GFP ) , RKY1920 ( ∆vps21 ) , RKY3307 ( ∆vps21 ∆vps68 ) , RKY2790 ( ∆snf7 ) , RKY3300 ( ∆snf7 ∆vps68 ) , RKY3376 ( ∆snf7 ∆vps21 ) . Left panels : Ste6 - GFP fluorescence , right panels : merged picture of differential interference contrast ( DIC ) image and fluorescence image . explore its role in endocytic trafficking and to gain information about how Vps68 intersects with ESCRT - III function , the effect of VPS68 deletion on the endocytic cargo protein Ste6 was examined . The ABC - transporter Ste6 is a very short - lived protein ( Kölling & Hollenberg , 1994 ) . After transport to the plasma membrane , it is internalized by endocytosis and moves to the 8 vacuole for degradation . To see , if Vps68 is required for Ste6 transport to the vacuole , the Ste6 half - life was determined by a Gal - depletion experiment in a wildtype stain and in a VPS68 deletion ( Fig . 3 ) . Ste6 was expressed from a GAL1 promoter inserted in front of the chromosomal STE6 gene . Cells were grown in galactose to induce expression from the GAL1 promoter and were then shifted to glucose containing medium , to repress transcription . In the wildtype strain , Ste6 was degraded with a half - life of 12 min . In the ∆vps68 strain , there was a slight delay in the degradation of Ste6 after shift to glucose medium and then Ste6 was degraded with a half - life of 29 min . Thus , Ste6 is moderately stabilized in the VPS68 deletion . Similar results had been reported for the a - factor receptor Ste3 ( Schluter et al . , 2008 ) . To determine the site of action of Vps68 in the endocytic pathway an epistasis analysis with established markers was performed . The localization of Ste6 - GFP expressed from a multicopy plasmid in different single and double mutant strains was examined by fluorescence microscopy ( Fig . 4 ) . In the wildtype , Ste6 - GFP stained the lumen of the vacuole and occasionally some endosomal dots . In the class D mutant ∆vps21 , with a defect in the fusion of endocytic vesicles with the endosome ( Bowers & Stevens , 2005 ) , Ste6 - GFP displays enhanced recycling to the yeast cell surface ( Krsmanovic´ et al , 2005 ) . In this mutant , a number of smaller vesicles , concentrated at the bud - neck and some staining of the bud surface , could be seen . No staining of the vacuolar lumen was visible . The ∆snf7 mutant displayed the classical class E phenotype with a large patch at the vacuole and staining of the vacuolar membrane ( Raymond et al . , 1992 ) . Curiously , the phenotype of the VPS68 deletion was dependent on the expression level of Ste6 - GFP . The copy number of the 2µ - vector used for expression of Ste6 - GFP varies considerably , thus some cells have a very high expression level and other cells express Ste6 - GFP only at low levels . With low level expression , the staining resembled wildtype , with a somewhat more pronounced staining of endosomal dots . In contrast , cells with high expression levels showed a brightly staining patch at the vacuole with a faint staining of the vacuolar membrane , similar to a class E staining . For the epistasis analysis , the double mutants were examined . The ∆vps21 ∆vps68 double mutant clearly looked like the ∆vps21 single mutant , thus ∆vps21 is epistatic over the ∆vps68 mutant , i . e . Vps21 acts before Vps68 . A similar result was obtained for the ∆snf7 ∆vps21 double mutant , which resembled the ∆vps21 single mutant . When ∆snf7 and ∆vps68 were combined , a class E - like staining was observed with the notable difference that the staining of the vacuolar membrane was missing . This synthetic phenotype indicates that Vps68 and Snf7 act at the same step . We also examined the localization of sfGFP - Vps68 ( Fig . S4 ) . In agreement with a previous report ( Schluter et al . , 2008 ) , we detected a handful of distinct dots , which presumably correspond to endosomes . In a ∆snf7 background Vps68 was trapped in class E structures . Thus , it is very likely that Vps68 acts at the level of the endosome , as reported previously . The VPS68 deletion alters ESCRT - III composition To further explore the relationship between Vps68 and ESCRT - III , we looked for differences in the composition of ESCRT - III in ∆vps68 compared to wildtype . ESCRT - III was 9 Figure 5 Altered ESCRT - III composition in ∆vps68 . Did2 , Ist1 , Mos10 , Snf7 , Vps2 and Vps24 were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts of RKY1558 ( wildtype ) and RKY3222 ( ∆vps68 ) . The immunoprecipitates were examined for co - immunoprecipitation of other ESCRT - III proteins by western blotting . The co - IP signals ( Figs . S5 ) were quantified by ImageJ . The percentage of protein that could be co - immunoprecipitated was calculated ( = Co - IP efficiency ) . Co - IP efficiencies were normalized to the primary IP efficiency of the bait protein . The co - IP efficiencies of the wildtype strain were subtracted from the co - IP efficiencies of the ∆vps68 strain . The co - immunoprecipitated proteins are indicated on top or below the columns . The color code of the proteins precipitated in the primary IP is given at the bottom of the diagram ( marked with IP ) . Average of two independent experiments . immunoprecipitated from cell extracts with antibodies against Did2 , Ist1 , Mos10 , Snf7 , Vps2 and Vps24 ( Chm7 was omitted , because it is not part of the endosomal complex and Vps20 was omitted due to low signal intensity ) . The immunoprecipitates were then analyzed for co - immunoprecipitation of the other ESCRT - III proteins . The Co - IP signals were quantified and the wildtype Co - IP efficiencies were subtracted from the Co - IP efficiencies of the ∆vps68 strain ( Fig . 5 , blots in Fig . S5 ) . As can be seen in Fig . 5 , a striking division among the different ESCRT - III proteins was observed . While the complexes precipitated from ∆vps68 contained less Did2 , Ist1 and Mos10 compared to wildtype , they contained more Snf7 , Vps2 and Vps24 . Snf7 , Vps2 and Vps24 are the core ESCRT - III components , which are thought to be actively involved in ILV formation and abscission . Did2 , Ist1 and Mos10 are the ESCRT - III associated proteins , which are thought to be involved in disassembly of ESCRT - III ( Azmi et al . , 2008 ; Dimaano et al . , 2008 ; Rue et al . , 2008 ) . Our results suggest that the VPS68 deletion interferes with the transition from an ILV - forming ESCRT - III complex to a disassembly competent complex . Effect of VPS68 deletion on the localization of ESCRT - III proteins Vps68 could act as a scaffold or adapter for ESCRT - III membrane association . Therefore , we examined the effect of the VPS68 deletion on membrane association of ESCRT - III proteins by a flotation experiment ( Fig . S6 - 1 ) . Only minor differences in the membrane associated 10 fractions between ∆vps68 and wildtype were observed . In general , about 30 - 50 % of the ESCRT - III proteins turned out to be membrane associated . The only exception was Mos10 with a very low level of membrane association of about 10 % . This experiment shows that Vps68 is not required for membrane association of ESCRT - III . Still , it could affect the site of membrane association of ESCRT - III proteins within the cell . Figure 6 Intracellular localization of ESCRT - III - sfGFP fusions . The intracellular localization of ESCRT - III - sfGFP fusions expressed from their chromosomal loci was examined by fluorescence microscopy . Left panels : wildtype background , right panels : ∆vps68 background . For each set : GFP fluorescence and merged image ( GFP + DIC ) . Strains from top to bottom ( WT / ∆vps68 ) : RKY3214 / 3269 ( Did2 - sfGFP ) , RKY3215 / 3257 ( Ist1 - sfGFP ) , RKY3216 / 3224 ( Mos10 - sfGFP ) , RKY3217 / 3279 ( Snf7 - sfGFP ) , RKY3218 / 3271 ( Vps2 - sfGFP ) , RKY3220 / 3274 ( Vps24 - sfGFP ) . 11 To examine the intracellular localization in the VPS68 deletion versus wildtype , all ESCRT - III proteins were C - terminally tagged with sfGFP by the insertion of a tagging cassette into the yeast genome . Since it is known that tagging of ESCRT - III proteins can lead to non - functional proteins , we tested the functionality of the tagged proteins . The strains were transformed with a single copy plasmid expressing an mCherry tagged variant of the vacuolar carboxypeptidase S ( Cps1 ) . Cps1 is transported to the lumen of the vacuole via the MVB pathway . The localization of mCherry - Cps1 was examined by fluorescence microscopy ( Fig . S6 - 2 and Fig . S6 - 3 ) . In the wildtype strain , mCherry - Cps1 exclusively stained the lumen of the vacuole . In the ∆vps24 mutant as a reference a typical class E staining was observed . The strain expressing Mos10 - 6His displayed a wildtype pattern , showing that the tagged protein is functional . The ESCRT - III - sfGFP fusions were compromised in their function to different degrees . While the mCherry - Cps1 staining in the IST1 - sfGFP strain was indistinguishable from wildtype , the SNF7 - , VPS2 - and VPS24 - sfGFP strains gave rise to a strong class E phenotype . The DID2 - and MOS10 - sfGFP strains showed a partial defect , with some luminal staining , but also a clearly visible vacuolar rim staining . Although , most of the tagged ESCRT - III proteins cannot support normal transport of endocytic cargo proteins to the lumen of the vacuole , they may still be useful for localization studies , because , as described below , the observed staining patterns looked pretty reasonable . The ESCRT - III proteins could be broadly divided into two groups with respect to their sfGFP staining patterns ( Fig . 6 ) . Did2 and Ist1 looked very similar with about half a dozen distinct dots . With Snf7 and Vps24 a brightly staining cluster of vesicles and a number of less intensively staining vesicles , which tended to be concentrated at the cell cortex , were observed . Vps24 resembled Snf7 and Vps2 in the sense that it also showed a brightly staining cluster of vesicles , but in contrast to these proteins , it had less additional vesicles . These staining patterns were not affected by VPS68 deletion . Mos10 - sfGFP , in contrast , showed a unique staining pattern . The staining was concentrated around the vacuole in a patchy manner . This staining is distinct from a class E staining , since the Mos10 patches were more numerous and not so grossly enlarged . This vacuolar Mos10 - sfGFP staining was completely lost in ∆vps68 . In this mutant , the pattern now resembled the Snf7 pattern . To further define the dot - like structures seen with the tagged ESCRT - III proteins , we compared the localization of Snf7 - mCherry with the localization of sfGFP - tagged yeast Rab proteins , which serve as markers for different organelles ( Fig . S6 - 4 ) . The N - terminally tagged Rab proteins were expressed from the SNF7 promoter at their chromosomal loci . As might have been expected , Snf7 - mCherry co - localized with the Rab5 homologue Vps21 , a thoroughly studied endosomal marker in yeast . The brightly staining vesicular clusters were stained for both proteins . But the staining of the two proteins did not completely overlap , there were also vesicular structures that were only stained by one or the other protein ( marked by arrows in Fig . S6 - 4 ) . The Rab5 homologue Ypt53 closely resembled Vps21 . The third Rab5 homologue Ypt52 showed an unusual staining pattern . Part of it also localized to the Snf7 clusters , but in addition , it also stained ER membranes . Thus , Ypt52 could be involved in the transport of proteins between endosomes and the ER . This intriguing finding clearly deserves further 12 Figure 7 Mos10 co - localizes with endosomal cargo proteins . Yeast strains expressing a chromosomal copy of tagged versions of Mos10 and specific marker proteins were examined for co - localization by fluorescence microscopy . The proteins were either tagged with sfGFP or mCherry depending on the signal intensity of the fusion proteins involved . Panels from left to right : Mos10 fluorescence ( either sfGFP or mCherry ) , marker protein fluorescence ( either mCherry or sfGfP ) , merged image , DIC image . Strains from top to bottom : RKY3448 ( Mos10 - sfGFP , Vph1 - mCherry ) , RKY3429 ( Mos10 - sfGFP , Sec63 - mCherry ) , RKY3482 ( Mos10 - mCherry , Cog5 - sfGFP ) , RKY3473 ( Mos10 - mCherry , sfGFP - Vps21 ) , RKY3484 ( Mos10 - mCherry , Cps1 - sfGFP ) , RKY3486 ( Mos10 - mCherry , Ste6 - sfGFP ) . study . Other Rab proteins , like the proteins that are associated with the Golgi or post - Golgi compartments as part of the secretory pathway ( Ypt6 , Ypt31 and Ypt32 ) showed no co - localization with Snf7 - mCherry . An interaction was observed between Snf7 - mCherry and sfGFP - Ypt10 . This protein is also considered as a Rab5 homologue and could play a role in endosome fusion to the vacuole ( Langemeyer et al , 2020 ) . But , so far not much is known about its function . If tagged alone , staining of the vacuolar membrane with a few associated dots 13 was observed , reminiscent of the Mos10 - sfGFP staining . However , this staining was lost , when Snf7 - mCherry was present in the same strain . Apparently , Ypt10 association with endosomal and vacuolar structures requires the successful completion of the ESCRT - III function , which is prevented by Snf7 tagging . Mos10 accumulates in endosomal structures at the vacuole Mos10 - sfGFP shows a unique circular staining around the vacuole . Z - Stacks reveal that this staining consists of vesicular / tubular structures forming an irregular network around the vacuole ( Fig . S7 ) . These structures could result from a proliferation of the vacuolar membrane , similar to the situation of Chm7 , where an accumulation inside the nucleus leads to a dramatic proliferation of the inner nuclear membrane ( Thaller et al . , 2019 ) . Alternatively , these structures could be derived from some other cellular compartment . To distinguish between these alternatives , the localization of Mos10 was compared with the localization of marker proteins by fluorescence microscopy . In some combinations Mos10 was tagged with mCherry , in others it was tagged with sfGFP ( Fig . 7 ) . The switch of the tag was necessary , because some of the marker proteins could not be visualized by the mCherry tag due to the low fluorescence intensity . First , Mos10 - sfGFP was compared with the vacuolar marker protein Vph1 - mCherry . In contrast to Mos10 , which displayed the usual irregular patchy staining , Vph1 showed a smooth , regular staining of the vacuolar membrane . The vacuoles were evenly stained , no concentration in patches could be seen . From this we conclude that the Mos10 - sfGFP structures are not derived from the vacuolar membrane , but are instead closely associated with it . These structures do not seem to be derived from ER or Golgi membranes , since no co - staining with the marker proteins Sec63 or Cog5 could be observed . With sfGFP - Vps21 a handful distinct dots were observed , which were not stained for Mos10 - mCherry . In some cases , Vps21 dots were seen at the vacuolar membrane , but they did not coincide with Mos10 patches . Thus , it appears that Vps21 does not co - localize with the Mos10 structures . Next , we examined two cargo proteins of the endocytic pathway , Cps1 and Ste6 , which are sorted to the vacuolar lumen via the MVB pathway . These two proteins stained the vacuolar membrane and co - localized with Mos10 patches . From this we conclude that the Mos10 - sfGFP structures at the vacuolar membrane are late endosomes . Switch from a Snf7 complex to a Mos10 complex In a previous report , we examined the influence of ESCRT - III deletion mutations on the composition of ESCRT - III ( Heinzle et al . , 2019 ) . We made the observation that anti - Mos10 antibodies co - immunoprecipitated most of the other ESCRT - III proteins , but not Snf7 . This opened up the possibility that at a certain point in the ESCRT - III functional cycle Snf7 is replaced by Mos10 , which could convert the active ESCRT - III complex into a disassembly competent complex . However , there was a caveat to this experiment . The anti - Mos10 antibodies showed a small degree of cross - reactivity towards Snf7 , so we had to introduce a correction factor for this cross - reactivity . The correction factor was obtained from the anti - Mos10 IP in a ∆mos10 background . Any Snf7 signal obtained under these conditions must be 14 Figure 8 Mos10 - 6His and Snf7 - 6His pulldowns . Mos10 - 6His and Snf7 - 6His were purified from cell extracts by Ni - NTA affinity chromatography . The purified proteins were examined for co - purification of other ESCRT - III proteins by western blotting as indicated on the left side of the panels . Lanes 1 - 3 : input , lanes 4 - 6 : Ni - NTA pulldown . ( A ) The strains used were : JD52 ( wildtype , lanes 1 , 4 ) , RKY2889 ( Mos10 - 6His , lanes 2 , 5 ) , RKY2978 ( Snf7 - 6His , lanes 3 , 6 ) . ( B ) The strains used were : JD52 ( wildtype , lanes 1 , 4 ) , RKY2889 ( Mos10 - 6His , lanes 2 , 5 ) , RKY3438 ( Mos10 - 6His ∆snf7 , lanes 3 , 6 ) . The position of tagged and native proteins is marked by arrows . Snf7 - 6His * = cross - reaction of the Mos10 antiserum with Snf7 - 6His . derived from the direct IP of Snf7 . This value was subtracted from the Snf7 co - IP signals in anti - Mos10 IPs . With this correction , no Snf7 co - IP was obtained with anti - Mos10 . But there is the possibility that we over - corrected . The direct IP of Snf7 by anti - Mos10 could be lower or even non - existent in the presence of Mos10 protein . To exclude this potential problem , we performed a pulldown experiment with Mos10 - 6His , which was purified from cell extracts by Ni - NTA . As a control , a Snf7 - 6His expressing strain was used . The proteins purified on the Ni - NTA beads were tested for the presence of ESCRT - III proteins by western blotting with specific antibodies . As can be seen in Fig . 8A , Vps2 and Vps24 , but no Snf7 and barely any Did2 were co - purified with Mos10 - 6His . This corroborates our previous findings and shows that the performed correction was appropriate . Snf7 - 6His did not bring down any of the ESCRT - III proteins tested , which indicates the Snf7 - 6His is non - functional . 15 We wondered whether the complex purified with Mos10 - 6His corresponded to the well - known endosomal complex involved in ILV formation or whether we purified a novel previously uncharacterized complex . To this end , we performed a pulldown experiment in a ∆snf7 background ( Fig . 8B ) . Again , Vps2 and Vps24 could be co - purified with Mos10 - 6His in the wildtype background , while no co - purification was observed in the ∆snf7 background . This demonstrates that although Mos10 - 6His does not bring down any Snf7 , the purified complex is nevertheless completely dependent on Snf7 . This apparent paradox can be nicely resolved by our assumption that ESCRT - III formation is initiated by Snf7 and that after completion of the ESCRT - III function , Snf7 is replaced by Mos10 followed by disassembly of the complex . This notion is supported by fluorescence microcopy of Mos10 - sfGFP structures . We could show that the localization of Mos10 - sfGFP to endosomal structures at the vacuole is completely dependent on the " upstream " ESCRT - III proteins Vps20 , Snf7 , Vps2 and Vps24 ( Fig . S8 - 1 ) . In the respective deletion mutants , Mos10 - sfGFP was completely cytosolic . By double - labeling experiments , we could further show that the Mos10 - sfGFP patches at the vacuole also contain Vps2 and Vps24 ( Fig . S8 - 2 ) . This is in line with the Ni - NTA pulldown experiments . A small discrepancy was noted with respect to Did2 . While Did2 - mCherry could be clearly detected in the Mos10 - sfGFP patches at the vacuole , only a very faint Did2 signal could be obtained in the Ni - NTA pulldown . But this discrepancy could be related to the different behavior of native vs . tagged protein . In the Mos10 - sfGFP Snf7 - mCherry strain , the Mos10 signal at the vacuole was lost . Instead , Mos10 - sfGFP now localized to the bright Snf7 - mCherry clusters and to smaller vesicles . Thus , Snf7 - mCherry tagging leads to the same phenotype as VPS68 deletion . This indicates that Snf7 and Vps68 act together at the same step . Also of note , the phenotype of Snf7 tagging was different from the phenotype of the SNF7 deletion . This shows that Snf7 - mCherry is not a completely non - functional protein , but that it preserves part of the Snf7 function . Membrane topology of Vps68 Vps68 is a membrane protein with four predicted transmembrane helices ( TM ) . At least one of the four helices ( helix 2 ) appears to be an amphipathic helix with an asymmetric distribution of hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids and a high hydrophobic moment ( < µ H > ) ( Fig . 9 ) . Vps68 resembles Nce102 in its structure . Nce102 is localized to plasma membrane invaginations called eisosomes . It has an unusual membrane topology with four potential TMs , where only TM1 and TM4 are spanning the membrane , while TM2 and TM3 are localized to the external space ( Loibl et al , 2010 ) . To see , whether Vps68 has a similar topology , a membrane topology analysis similar to the one described for Nce102 was performed . To probe the topology of Vps68 , different N - terminal fragments of Vps68 were fused to the first 307 amino acids of mature invertase ( Suc2 ) followed by His4 deleted for the first 33 amino acids ( His4C ) ( Sengstag et al , 1990 ) . Three HA tags were inserted between the Vps68 and the Suc2 portions for western blot detection . The fusion proteins were expressed from single copy plasmids under the control of the PDC1 promoter ( Fig . 9 ) . Depending on the TMs present in the N - terminal Vps68 fragment , the downstream sequences either point to the lumen of the 16 Figure 9 ( A ) Helical wheel projection of the predicted TMs of Vps68 . The predicted TMs of Vps68 were analyzed with HeliQuest ( Gautier et al , 2008 ) . The hydrophobicity ( < H > ) and the hydrophobic moment ( < µ H > ) are indicated for each ⍺ - helix .

The HOL1 - 1 strain STY50 was transformed with plasmids expressing different fragments of Vps68 fused to Suc2 and His4C fragments . ( A ) Glycosylation patterns of fusion proteins . Cell extracts of the transformants were examined for the fusion proteins by western blotting with anti - HA antibodies . Cell extracts were either treated with Endo H to remove N - glycosylation ( lanes with even numbers , Endo H + ) or were left untreated ( lanes with odd numbers , Endo H - ) . The following plasmids were used : pRK2015 ( lanes 1 , 2 , no Vps68 ) , pRK2016 ( lanes 3 , 4 , Vps68 with TM1 ) , pRK2017 ( lanes 5 , 6 , Vps68 with TM1 + TM2 ) , pRK2018 ( lanes 7 , 8 , Vps68 with TM1 + TM2 + TM3 ) and pRK2019 ( lanes 9 , 10 , full - length Vps68 ) . Lane 11 : protein marker . ( B ) Growth on histidinol plates . The transformants were plated on agar plates containing histidine ( left ) or histidinol ( right ) . The plasmids contained in the transformants were ( starting from the top , counterclockwise direction ) : YCplac33 ( vector ) , pRK2015 , pRK2016 , pRK2017 , pRK2018 , pRK2019 . The plasmids expressing fusion proteins , whose C - terminus points to the cytosol are highlighted . ( C ) Membrane topology predicted from the experiments . The positions of the TMs in the Vps68 sequence are indicated . 18 ER or to the cytosol . When they point to the lumen of the ER , N - glycosylation sites in Suc2 are modified by the attachment of sugar chains , which leads to a mobility shift of the fusion protein on SDS gels . To prove that the mobility shift is caused by glycosylation , the sugar chains can be removed by Endoglycosidase H ( Endo H ) treatment . The truncated His4C protein has histidinol dehydrogenase activity . Yeast cells expressing this protein are able to grow on histidinol plates in the absence of histidine in a HOL1 - 1 strain background ( Sengstag et al . , 1990 ) . But growth is only possible , when His4C is present in the cytosol . Thus , we have two complementary ways of assessing the localization of the sequences downstream of the Vps68 fragments . The western blot analysis of the different fusion constructs is presented in Fig . 10A . The fusion protein without Vps68 sequences runs at the expected position of 114 , 3 kDa and is not affected by Endo H treatment . Insertion of the N - terminal Vps68 fragment containing TM1 leads to a shift to higher mobility , larger than the one expected from the addition of the Vps68 sequences . This shift is reversed by Endo H treatment . This shows that TM1 spans the membrane and that the N - terminus of Vps68 points to the cytosol , while the rest of the fusion protein is inside the ER . When a fragment containing TM1 and TM2 is inserted , the same pattern is obtained . This shows that TM2 does not span the membrane and that the sequences downstream of TM1 are still oriented towards the lumen of the ER . This fusion protein appears to be unstable , because the western blot signal is weaker than the signal for the previous constructs . The same pattern was observed with the Vps68 fragment containing TM1 , TM2 and TM3 , i . e . TM3 also does not span the membrane . Finally , when the complete sequence of Vps68 , containing all four TMs , was inserted , no Endo H dependent mobility shift was observed . This indicates that TM4 traverses the membrane and that the C - terminus of Vps68 points to the cytosol . Now , the same strains were streaked out on plates containing either histidine or histidinol ( Fig . 10B ) . While all strains grew on the histidine plate , only the fusion with full - length Vps68 and the control without Vps68 sequences were able to grow on the histidinol plate , i . e . in these constructs the His4C part is localized to the cytosol . This result is the exact mirror image of the western blot experiment . Taken together , this experiment demonstrates that Vps68 has indeed the same topology as Nce102 . Vps68 forms a hairpin structure with TM1 and TM4 traversing the membrane and TM2 and TM3 being localized to the luminal side of the endosomal membrane ( Fig . 10C ) . Both TM2 and TM3 appear to be amphipathic helices that are able to interact with the luminal leaflet of the endosomal membrane . Discussion Here we present evidence that Vps68 interacts with ESCRT - III and that it cooperates with ESCRT - III in ILV formation and abscission . Our data further suggest that at some point in the ESCRT - III functional cycle Snf7 is replaced by Mos10 . This switch in ESCRT - III subunits could be associated with a transition from an active complex to a disassembly competent complex . 19 Vps68 interacts with ESCRT - III In a previous report , it was proposed that Vps68 acts with or downstream of the ESCRT machinery to regulate a novel step in endosome biogenesis ( Schluter et al . , 2008 ) . Our findings now suggest that Vps68 is tightly connected to ESCRT - III function . First of all , we were able to show that Vps68 physically interacts with ESCRT - III . At present it is not clear how Vps68 interacts with ESCRT - III , but Mos10 seems to be dispensable for the interaction , since ESCRT - III subunits could still be immunoprecipitated by Vps68 in the absence of Mos10 . Loss of Vps68 leads to a shift in the composition of ESCRT - III . The number of core components in the complex ( Snf7 , Vps2 and Vps24 ) increases , while the number of the associated subunits ( Did2 , Ist1 and Mos10 ) decreases . This supports the view that at some point during the functional cycle a switch occurs from an active complex involved in ILV formation and / or abscission to a disassembly competent complex . This switch is reflected in a change in ESCRT - III composition . The precise function of ESCRT - III during the formation of an intraluminal vesicle is still not clear . ESCRT - III could be involved in the deformation of the endosomal membrane , or its function could be restricted to the release of the vesicle from the membrane into the lumen of the endosome . In any case , these events have to be tightly coordinated with the incorporation of cargo proteins into the forming vesicle . The function of ESCRT - III is completed , when all cargo proteins are removed from the endosomal membrane . The cue that signals completion of the ESCRT - III task is not known , but it is tempting to speculate that the presence of ubiquitinated cargo proteins in the endosomal membrane is part of the signal . As soon as the ubiquitinated cargos are removed , ESCRT - III would switch to a disassembly competent complex followed by its rapid dissolution . The ESCRT - III associated subunits have been implicated in ESCRT - III disassembly ( Azmi et al . , 2008 ; Dimaano et al . , 2008 ; Rue et al . , 2008 ) . This notion is reinforced by our observation that ESCRT - III core components accumulate at the membrane in a MOS10 deletion . The finding that the associated subunits are underrepresented in the ∆vps68 strain , while the core subunits are overrepresented , indicates that the completion of the ESCRT - III task is delayed in ∆vps68 . A close connection between the Vp68 function and the presence of cargo protein is also suggested by our epistasis analysis . When the cargo protein Ste6 - sfGFP was expressed to near wildtype levels , an effect of the VPS68 deletion on the localization Ste6 - sfGFP was barely detectable . But upon overexpression , a class E - like phenotype was observed . From this we conclude that Vps68 assists ESCRT - III in its function . When the load on the endocytic pathway is high , Vps68 is especially critical for the function of the ESCRT - III system . Role of Vps68 What could be the role of Vps68 ? A potential function is suggested by the unusual membrane topology of Vps68 . We found that the two potential membrane helices 2 and 3 are not spanning the membrane , but are instead localized to the luminal side of the endosomal membrane . At least helix 2 appears to be an amphipathic helix ( AH ) with a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic face and a high hydrophobic moment . Helix 3 is probably also an amphipathic helix . Amphipathic helices have the tendency to interact with membrane surfaces . A number of functions have been ascribed to amphipathic helices ( Gimenez - Andres et al , 2018 ) . The AH 20 containing protein Pex11 , for instance , deforms membranes and induces tubulation . Some AHs can sense or stabilize membrane curvature , they act as amphipathic lipid packing sensors ( ALPS ) . Yet other AHs like in melittin disturb the integrity of the lipid bilayer . We propose that Vps68 , analogous to melittin , facilitates ILV abscission by disturbing the order of the lipids in the luminal leaflet of the bilayer . ESCRT - III in turn could act in the same way on the cytosolic leaflet . By simultaneously acting on opposing leaflets of the bilayer , ESCRT - III and Vps68 could promote the release of the ILV from the endosomal membrane . Switch from a Snf7 to a Mos10 containing ESCRT - III complex As described above , it appears plausible that during an ESCRT - III functional cycle a shift occurs from an active complex to a disassembly competent complex . The shift is accompanied by a change in ESCRT - III composition . We think , the key event in this transition is the replacement of Snf7 by Mos10 . This conclusion is derived from our co - immunoprecipitation and pulldown experiments . In Ni - NTA pulldowns with Mos10 - 6His , the core ESCRT - III subunits Vps2 and Vps24 were co - purified ( and a small amount of Did2 ) , but no Snf7 . In principle , this Mos10 complex could be unrelated to the endosomal ESCRT - III complex . But we think this is not the case . We found that the co - purification of ESCRT - III subunits with Mos10 was completely Snf7 dependent . Our interpretation of this finding is that Snf7 initiates ESCRT - III formation , but that it is replaced later on by Mos10 . Snf7 and Mos10 are closely related . The ESCRT - III proteins can be divided into two classes , based on sequence homology ( Leung et al . , 2008 ) . A member of each class was already present in the last common eukaryotic ancestor ( LCEA ) . The first class consists of Snf7 , Mos10 and Vps20 ( and also Chm7 ) and the second class contains Did2 , Vps2 and Vps24 . In fact , in our initial report , we were only able to identify the first class of ESCRT - III proteins , the second class escaped our attention due to divergence in the primary sequence ( Kranz et al . , 2001 ) . A number of observations suggest that Mos10 acts after Snf7 . A careful study of the morphology of MVBs in ESCRT - III mutants showed a clear distinction between the core components Snf7 , Vps2 , Vps20 and Vps24 and the ESCRT - III associated proteins Did2 and Mos10 ( Nickerson et al . , 2010 ) . When one of the core components was deleted , no ILVs were formed . Instead , the typical class E structures , closely juxtaposed flatted endosomes could be observed . In did2 and mos10 mutants , ILVs were stilled formed , but the MVBs assumed an elongated morphology called " vesicular tubular endosomes " VTEs . Previous evidence and the findings in our study clearly point to a role of Mos10 in the disassembly of ESCRT - III , which appears to occur after ILV formation is finished . Licensing in the endocytic pathway Mos10 - sfGFP shows a unique intracellular distribution . While the other ESCRT - III proteins localized to punctate structures , Mos10 - sfGFP was detected at the vacuolar membrane . For the localization studies , we used C - terminally tagged ESCRT - III proteins . Most of these tagged proteins were compromised in their function . But still , useful information can be gained from the investigation of these proteins . The phenotypes of the tagged proteins were clearly different from complete knockouts , which shows that the function of these proteins is partly 21 preserved . In fact , we think that these proteins can be used as tools to dissect the ESCRT - III cycle , since tagging of different ESCRT - III proteins arrests the cycle at distinct steps . Thus , tagging of Snf7 leads to an early arrest , while tagging of Mos10 arrests the cycle at a later time point . It appears that an early arrest , like the one imposed by tagging of Snf7 , prevents downstream events like tethering and fusion of late endosomes with the vacuolar membrane . For this reason , the tagged core ESCRT - III proteins were detected in endosomal structures and not at the vacuole . The successive events in the endocytic pathway seem to be strictly depended on each other . Only upon successful completion of one step , the next step is licensed . Thus , progression to endosome tethering only occurs when ILV formation is completed . Disassembly of ESCRT - III does not seem to be a precondition for endosome tethering to the vacuole . That is why the ESCRT - III complex containing Mos10 - sfGFP is detected in endosomal structures tethered to the vacuole . ESCRT - III disassembly in turn could be a precondition for endosome fusion , since we observed a large number of Mos10 - sfGFP structures at the vacuolar membrane . Mos10 - sfGFP was not detected at the vacuolar membrane in a strain expressing tagged Snf7 or in a strain carrying a VPS68 deletion . In these strains , Mos10 - sfGFP showed an endosomal localization . This further supports the idea that Snf7 and Vps68 closely act together and that progression to endosome tethering is blocked , when these functions are compromised . Materials and methods Plasmids and yeast strains Yeast cells were grown in YPD medium ( 1 % yeast extract , 2 % peptone , 2 % glucose ) for immunoprecipitation experiments and in SD / CAS medium ( 0 . 67 % yeast nitrogen base , 1 % casamino acids , 2 % glucose , 50 mg / l uracil and tryptophan ) for fluorescence microscopy . For SILAC , yeasts were grown in SD medium ( 0 . 67 % yeast nitrogen base , 2 % glucose ) with the required auxotrophic markers . Arginine and lysine labeled with heavy isotopes [ 13C6 / 15N2 ] were obtained from Silantes GmbH ( Munich , Germany ) . The yeast strains used are listed in Tab . S2 . All yeast strains constructed in this study are derived from JD52 ( J . Dohmen , Cologne , Germany ) by the integration of PCR - cassettes into the yeast genome ( Longtine et al , 1998 ) . Some deletions were generated by the CRISPR / Cas9 technique ( Brune et al , 2019 ) . The plasmids used in this study are listed in Tab . S3 . Mos10 - 6His purification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography ( IMAC ) For SILAC ( stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture ) experiments , cells were grown in SD medium with 50 mg / l adenine , histidine , uracil , tryptophan , 120 mg / l leucine and 60 mg / l arginine and lysine . Cells were grown overnight to exponential phase ( OD 600 < 1 . 0 ) at 30°C , harvested and washed with PBS . The wildtype strain RKY2998 was grown in light medium and the Mos10 - 6His strain RKY2999 was grown in heavy medium . Equal amounts of the heavy and light cells were mixed and resuspended in 10 ml PBS . The cells were lysed by glass - beading in a Fast Prep24 machine ( MP Biomedicals , Eschwege , Germany ) ( 2 - times , 1 min , 4 m / s ) . Next , the cell lysate was incubated with 4 mM disuccinimidyl suberate ( DSS ) crosslinker for 1 h at 4°C on a rocker . The reaction was stopped by quenching with 100 mM 22 Tris - HCl pH 8 and the membranes were solubilized with 1 % Triton X - 100 for 15 min at 4°C . To remove cell debris , the lysate was spun at 15 , 000 g at 4°C for 15 min . The supernatant was adjusted to 300 mM NaCl and 15 mM imidazole and filtered through a 0 . 45 µm filter . The sample was then applied to a AEKTA start chromatography system ( GE Healthcare Europe GmbH , Freiburg , Germany ) , and purification of crosslinked proteins was achieved on a 1 ml HisTrap™ Fast Flow column . Bound proteins were eluted from the column by a 50 - 500 mM imidazole gradient . The collected fractions were analyzed by SDS - PAGE with Coomassie blue staining and western blotting with anti - Mos10 antibodies . The fractions containing Mos10 - 6His crosslinks were analyzed by mass spectrometry ( Core Facility , University of Hohenheim ) . Mos10 - 6His was also purified by IMAC on a small scale . Cells were grown in YPD medium to exponential phase and 20 OD 600 of cells were harvested . Basically , the cells were processed as described below for the co - immunoprecipitation with the modification that after the 500 g spin , 20 mM imidazole and 50 µl of a 50 % Ni - NTA bead slurry were added instead of the antibodies and protein A sepharose beads . Co - immunoprecipitation For Co - immunoprecipitation ( Co - IP ) experiments , 50 OD 600 cells of an exponential YPD culture were harvested , washed with PBS and resuspended in 200 µl PBS with protease inhibitors . The cells were lysed by glass - beading for 5 min at 4°C . After lysis , 600 µl PBS and 2 . 5 mM of the cleavable crosslinker dithiobis ( succinimidylpropionate ) ( DSP ) were added . The solution was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a rocker . The crosslinking reaction was stopped by quenching with 100 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 and the membranes were dissolved by 1 % Triton X - 100 . The reaction was incubated for 15 min at 4 °C on a rocker and then centrifuged for 10 min at 500 g at 4°C to remove cell debris . Then the supernatant was incubated with 10 µl antiserum for 1 h at 4°C on a rocker followed by an incubation with 80 µl of a 50 % slurry of protein A sepharose beads for 1 h at 4°C . The solution was washed three times with 1 ml PBS at 100 g for 30 s . The beads were resuspended in a mixture of 100 µl PBS and 100 µl SDS sample buffer and heated to 95°C for 5 min . Endoglycosidase H treatment The cells were grown to exponential phase ( OD 600 < 1 ) and 10 OD 600 were harvested , washed in 10 mM NaN 3 and resuspended in 100 µl of lysis buffer ( 0 . 3 M sorbitol , 50 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 ) with protease inhibitors . After glass - beading for 5 min at 4°C , 150 µl of SDS sample buffer were added and then the mixture was heated at 50°C for 20 min . The lysate was centrifuged at 20 , 000 g for 5 min in a table top centrifuge to remove cell debris . The supernatant was diluted 1 : 10 with Endo H buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 6 . 8 , 50 mM EDTA , 1 % Triton X - 100 ) . Two 100 µl aliquots were incubated overnight at 37°C with and without Endo H ( 3000 U , NEB ) . Then the samples were heated with 100 µl SDS sample buffer for 5 min at 95°C . Cell fractionation The sucrose gradients were performed as described in ( Heinzle et al . , 2019 ) . Flotation was performed as described in ( Pawelec et al , 2010 ) . 23 References Adell MAY , Migliano SM , Upadhyayula S , Bykov YS , Sprenger S , Pakdel M , Vogel GF , Jih G , Skillern W , Behrouzi R et al ( 2017 ) Recruitment dynamics of ESCRT - III and Vps4 to endosomes and implications for reverse membrane budding .
