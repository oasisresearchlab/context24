Cummings 1 ✉ The molecular mechanisms regulating lymphocyte homing into lymph nodes are only partly understood . Here , we report that B cell - speci ﬁ c deletion of the X - linked gene , Cosmc , and the consequent decrease of protein O - glycosylation , induces developmental blocks of mouse B cells . After transfer into wild - type recipient , Cosmc - null B cells fail to home to lymph nodes as well as non - lymphoid organs . Enzymatic desialylation of wild - type B cells blocks their migration into lymph nodes , indicating a requirement of sialylated O - glycans for proper traf ﬁ cking . Mechanistically , Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells have normal rolling and ﬁ rm arrest on high endothelium venules ( HEV ) , thereby attributing their inef ﬁ cient traf ﬁ cking to alterations in the subsequent transendothelial migration step . Finally , Cosmc - null B cells have defective chemokine signaling responses . Our results thus demonstrate that Cosmc and its effects on O - glycosylation are important for controlling B cell homing . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 17765 - 6 OPEN 1 Department of Surgery , Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA , USA . 2 Department of Microbiology & Immunobiology , Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA , USA . 3 Department of Biochemistry , Emory University , Atlanta , GA , USA . 4 The Ragon Institute of MGH , MIT & Harvard , Cambridge , MA , USA . 5 Present address : Of ﬁ ce of Biotechnology Products , Center for Drug Evaluation and Research , U .

Thus , constitutive circulation of lymphocytes between blood and lymphoid systems is essential for immune surveillance . Naïve lymphocytes enter lymph nodes through a complex and partly understood process that begins with a series of molecular interactions requiring glycans on endothelial cells of lymph nodes that are recognized by L - selectin on lymphocytes 1 – 3 . This recognition by L - selectin of peripheral node addressins ( PNAds ) on high endothelial venules ( HEV ) mediates initial tethering and rolling of lymphocytes 2 , 4 – 6 . Subsequent chemokine signaling through G protein - coupled receptors , e . g . CCR7 and its ligands CCL19 and CCL21 , activate lymphocyte integrins , leading to ﬁ rm arrest , and ﬁ nally the diapedesis of the adherent cells into the lymph node 7 . It is not clear , however , whether the glycans on the lymphocytes themselves are important in homing . The potential importance of lymphocyte glycans in homing was suggested by the seminal studies of Gesner and Ginsberg 8 , 9 . Using a radioactivity - based assay , their ﬁ ndings suggested that glycosidase treatment of intact lymphocytes decreased their homing to lymph nodes in recipient rats . The nature and func - tions of the lymphocyte glycoconjugates implicated in this pro - cess remain unknown . Many studies have demonstrated that mucin - type O - glycans , characterized by extended modi ﬁ cations of the core 1 O - glycan structure Gal β 1 - 3GalNAc1 - α - Ser / Thr , which are expressed on granulocytes and activated T cells , are important in many aspects of leukocyte traf ﬁ cking in in ﬂ ammation , through interactions with selectins 10 . The extension of O - glycans in normal cells occurs by addition of other sugars , including N - acet - ylglucosamine , fucose and sialic acid 11 . There is scant informa - tion , however , about the roles of lymphocyte glycans in homing , but some studies suggest the possibility that O - glycosylation might be important 12 – 14 . The presence of galactose residues in core 1 O - glycans requires expression of a single enzyme T - synthase , encoded by T - synthase ( C1GalT1 ) , which in the Golgi apparatus converts Tn antigen ( CD175 ) GalNAc α 1 - Ser / Thr to the ubiquitous core - 1 O - glycan 15 , 16 . The formation of active T - synthase requires a dedi - cated molecular chaperone termed Cosmc in the endoplasmic reticulum 17 . Cosmc ( C1GalT1C1 ) is encoded on the X chromo - some ( human Xq24 , mouse Xc3 ) and systemic deletion of either T - synthase or Cosmc leads to an embryonic lethality 18 , 19 . Con - ditional deletion of Cosmc in hematopoietic and endothelial cells results in severe pathology that leads to embryonic death ; inter - estingly , surviving mice suffer macrothrombocytopenia and perinatal hemorrhage and die within a few months 20 . With the long - term goal of understanding the role of O - glycans on B cell biology , here we generate and characterize the murine B cell - speci ﬁ c Cosmc KO mice , which have speci ﬁ cally blocked extension of O - GalNAc - type O - glycans on glycoproteins of B cells . Our subsequent analyses demonstrate a critical role of Cosmc and extended O - glycans in B cell development and homing . Results Reduced B cells in B cell - speci ﬁ c Cosmc - KO lymph nodes . To directly address the potential roles of O - glycans in B cell homing , we engineered a targeted deletion of Cosmc in B cells by crossing the LoxP - ﬂ anked Cosmc mice with Mb1 - Cre mice to generate B cell - speci ﬁ c Cosmc - knockout ( BC - Cosmc KO ) mice 21 and further con ﬁ rmed Cosmc deletion in B220 + B cells ( Supplementary Fig . 1A , B ) . Additionally , we analyzed surface expression of the Tn antigen ( CD175 ) , an abnormal glycan structure that can arise from dysfunctional Cosmc , on splenic B cells in BC - Cosmc KO mice . We found that > 96 % of splenic B cells express Tn antigen , demonstrating ef ﬁ cient Cosmc knockout ( Supplementary Fig . 1C ) . The BC - Cosmc KO mice appeared outwardly normal and healthy at the time of experimentation . However , the BC - Cosmc KO mice exhibited splenomegaly and the wet spleen mass was ~ 60 % greater than that of WT ( Fig . 1a ) . Cellularity analysis by ﬂ ow cytometry indicated reduced B cell numbers by 40 % from the BC - Cosmc KO mice in the spleen and bone marrow ( BM ) ( Fig . 1b , c ) , compared to WT . By contrast , we observed a remarkable decrease of B cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) and peripheral lymph nodes ( PLNs ) ( Fig . 1d ) , indicating profound migration defects in Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells . To further examine whether the B cell reduction in PLNs of BC - Cosmc KO mice is extended to gut associated lymphoid tissues ( GALTs ) , we analyzed the mesenteric lymph nodes ( MLNs ) and Peyer ’ s patches ( PPs ) . Similar to PLNs , we observed a marked reduction of B cells in the MLNs and PPs of BC - Cosmc KO mice ( Fig . 1e ) . We also examined T lymphocyte subsets in peripheral lymphoid organs in BC - Cosmc KO mice . Compared to littermate wild - type control , both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were increased in spleen , which likely contribute to the splenic enlargement ( Supplementary Fig . 1D ) . Additionally , we observed pronounced reduction of B cells in the lung and liver of BC - Cosmc KO mice ( Fig . 1f ) . We analyzed the spleen from both BC - Cosmc KO and WT mice using immuno ﬂ uorescence staining and observed normal B cell follicles ( Fig . 1g ) . Consistent with our ﬂ ow cytometry data , we observed signi ﬁ cant reduction of CD19 - immunostained B cells in the peripheral and mesenteric lymph nodes of BC - Cosmc KO mice ( Fig . 1h – i ) . We observed rudimen - tary PPs in the small intestine of the BC - Cosmc KO mice as compared to WT ( Fig . 1j ) which is consistent with previous studies suggesting a role for B cells in PPs organogenesis 22 , 23 . Altered B cell development in BC - Cosmc KO mice . To investi - gate the role of Cosmc in B cell development , we analyzed the B cell subsets from the BM and the spleen of both wild - type and BC - Cosmc KO mice using ﬂ ow cytometry ( Fig . 2 ) . Notably , we found that the major defects were observed in B cell progenitors after the pro - B cell stage ( Hardy fraction B ) , where Mb1 - Cre becomes active , in bone marrow of the BC - Cosmc KO mice ( Fig . 2a , b ) . We observed > 90 % reduction of both small pre - B cell ( Hardy fraction D ) and recirculating mature B cell ( Hardy frac - tion F ) , and also on the other side we observed a 3 . 5 - fold increase of immature B cells ( Hardy fraction E ) in the BC - Cosmc KO mice . In the spleen , both the IgM + IgD + and IgM + IgD − B cells were reduced ( Fig . 2c ) . The marginal zone ( MZ ) B cells were increased > twofold , with a concomitant reduction of follicular ( FO ) B cells in the BC - Cosmc KO mice ( Fig . 2d ) . Of note , we observed enhanced expression of CD21 on splenic B cells , as well as IgM and IgD on B cells , complicating the demarcation of the B cell subsets using these markers ( Fig . 2a – d ) . The Cosmc - de ﬁ cient mature B cells were substantially reduced in the bone marrow , compared to those in the spleen , indicating a possibly impaired recirculation of mature B cells back to the bone marrow . Col - lectively , these data demonstrate that Cosmc mutation in B cells alters their development in both BM and spleen . BC - Cosmc KO mice exhibited reduced B cell numbers in bone marrow and peripheral lymphoid tissues . Paradoxically , BC - Cosmc KO mice exhibited increased levels of total IgM in serum , which may re ﬂ ect the increased numbers of MZ B cells ( Fig . 2e ) . Meanwhile , BC - Cosmc KO mice demonstrated reduced serum IgA level , an immunoglobulin isotype that is primarily produced by intestinal B cells . BC - Cosmc KO mice had scarce B cells in Peyer ’ s patches , which likely contributes to the decreased amount of serum IgA . In addition , dynamic changes in IgG isotypes level ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 17765 - 6 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 3990 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 17765 - 6 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications were observed , with increased levels of IgG2b , IgG2c , and a surprisingly marked reduction of IgG3 ( Fig . 2e ) . Cosmc controls B cell homing to LNs and non - lymphoid organs . We were intrigued by the disproportionate reduction of resident B cells number in the spleen , PLNs , and PPs of the BC - Cosmc KO mice as compared to WT . To determine whether homing of B cells into those tissues is affected , we conducted adoptive transfer experiments . We isolated splenic cells from either BC - Cosmc KO mice or littermate controls , labeled them with CellTrace violet , and co - injected into WT recipient mice with CFSE - labeled WT splenocytes as an internal control . Mice were sacri ﬁ ced at 2 or 20 h post - injection , and ﬂ ow cytometry was used to determine the frequencies of their appearance in PBL , spleen , MLNs , PPs , and PLNs . Remarkably , at 2 h , there were few Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells in LNs and PPs ( Fig . 3a ) , as we observed less than 2 % of Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells migrated to PLNs , MLNs , and PPs , as compared to control B cells . After 20 h , the accumulation of Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells remained signi ﬁ cantly reduced , with only 3 % in PLNs , and less than 1 % in both MLNs , and PPs ( Fig . 3b ) , compared to control B cells . We also observed that a negligible number of the Cosmc - de ﬁ - cient B cells had migrated into the lung and liver ( Fig . 3c ) . We obtained similar results when we used BC - Cosmc KO mice as recipients ( Supplementary Fig . 2A , B ) . Collectively , these data demonstrate that Cosmc is essential for normal B cell migration to both lymphoid and non - lymphoid organs , in a cell - intrinsic manner . Glycan pro ﬁ ling of B cells . To gain insights into the nature of glycans on Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells , we ﬁ rst analyzed the released Asn - linked oligosaccharides ( N - glycans ) from puri ﬁ ed WT and Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells using mass spectrometry . Our analysis of the N - glycan pro ﬁ le showed no signi ﬁ cant differences compared to WT ( Supplementary Fig . 3A , B ) , indicating that the deletion of Cosmc in B cells does not affect N - glycosylation pathways .

IgG N - glycopeptide analysis revealed very similar glycan pro ﬁ les among all IgG subtypes with minor differences in IgG sialylation ( Supplementary Fig . 4A – D ) . Importantly , we observed that B cells derived from the BC - Cosmc KO mice lacked extended O - glycans in their glycoproteins as compared to WT ( Fig . 4a , b ) . This was con ﬁ rmed on a protein - speci ﬁ c level in our analysis of the hinge - region of IgG2b . Thr104 ( UniProt annotation ) was identi ﬁ ed to be partially O - glycosylated ( Supplementary Fig . 5A , B ) , which is consistent with a previous report 24 . While IgG2b from WT mice sera expresses mono - and disialylated core 1 O - glycans , the IgG2b from BC - Cosmc KO mice shows exclusively the Tn antigen ( Fig . 4c ) . These results demonstrate that Cosmc deletion does not affect N - glycan structures , but causes the loss of extended O - glycans , resulting in the expression of the Tn antigen on B cells . Also consistent with a previous study 25 , N - glycans from B cells include biantennary complex - type N - glycans capped with the sialic acid Neu5Gc , as well as Neu5Ac ( Supplementary Fig . 3A ) . Moreover , we identi ﬁ ed abundant high - mannose - type N - glycans , as well as poly - N - acetyllactosamine - containing glycans ( – 3Gal β 1 - 4GlcNAc β 1 – ) n ( Supplementary Fig . 3A ) . Notably , after neur - aminidase ( sialidase ) treatment , the binding of PNA , which binds to the core 1 disaccharide Gal β 1 - 3GalNAc α 1 - Ser / Thr , was enhanced on both WT B and T cells , as expected ( Supplementary Fig . 6A , B ) . By contrast , the binding of Maackia amurensis lectin - II ( MAL - II ) , which is speci ﬁ c for α 2 - 3 - linked sialic acid on the core 1 disaccharide , as well as the binding of Sambucus nigra agglutinin ( SNA ) , speci ﬁ c for α 2 - 6 - linked sialic acids , were decreased in both WT B and T cells ( Supplementary Fig . 6A , B ) . Together , these results demonstrate that glycoproteins of WT murine B cells express extended and sialylated O - glycans , which are lacking on BC - Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells .

The above results demonstrate that extended O - glycans are required for proper B cell homing to lymph nodes . As O - glycans are frequently capped with sialic acid , we treated lymphocytes with neuraminidase in order to identify whether sialic acids on lymphocytes play a role their homing to lymph nodes ( Fig . 4a , c ) . This treatment , however , is not speci ﬁ c for O - glycans , as it releases sialic acids from both O - and N - glycans , and there is no available neuraminidase that speci ﬁ cally can desialylate O - glycans ( Supplementary Fig . 6A , B ) . We adoptively transferred a pre - paration of neuraminidase - treated and dye - labeled bulk WT splenocytes into WT recipient mice and examined their dis - tribution within diverse organs using ﬂ ow cytometry . We observed that in WT recipients , PBS - treated WT cells were dis - tributed as expected into lymph nodes and other organs . How - ever , neuraminidase - treated WT splenocytes accumulated in the liver ; strikingly , the majority of these cells were Thy1 . 2 + T cells , which were 5 - fold increased , compared to untreated T cells ( Fig . 4d , Supplementary Fig . 6C ) . Remarkably , neither neuraminidase - treated B cells nor control B cells were targeted to the liver , as the neuraminidase - treated B cells showed substantially impaired migration to the liver , compared to control B cells ( Fig . 4d ) . Both neuraminidase - treated T and B cells showed signi ﬁ cantly reduced accumulation in PLNs , PPs , and lung ( Fig . 4e , f , Supplementary Fig . 6D ) . These results demon - strate that surface sialic acid on lymphocytes is crucial for T and B cell maintenance in the periphery . More importantly , based on this result and those above with BC - Cosmc KO mice , we conclude that sialylated O - glycans are required for B cell homing . Intravital microscopy of Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cell homing . To directly assess whether other aspects of B cell homing , such as cell rolling or adhesion to endothelium , which largely is known to depend on L - selectin , might be defective in the Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells , we performed intravital microscopy ( IVM ) in inguinal lymph nodes . For the ﬁ ve discrete venular orders examined , the rolling and sticking fraction of B cells in HEVs was not affected in BC - Cosmc KO mice ( Fig . 5a , b , representative videos are shown in Supplementary Movies 1 and 2 ) . Interestingly , when we measured the rolling velocity ( V roll ) , which re ﬂ ects cell movement while adhesively contacting the HEV surface , we found that the median V roll of Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells was increased to 122 . 4 µm / s in order III HEVs , 68 % higher than it was in WT control ( Fig . 5c ) . V roll has been reported to be sensitive to L - selectin expression level , with higher expression of CD62L resulting in lowered V roll 12 . These data suggest that Cosmc contributes to some extent to the rolling interaction after tethering , but these relatively modest effects are unlikely to contribute to the major defects in homing of Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells . Based on the above results that Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells lack major defects in rolling and arrest , we considered the possibility that the cells may be defective in terminal steps of transmigration and diapedesis . Lymphocytes enter the lymph nodes through HEVs , which involves a cascade of molecular events between lymphocytes and HEVs 1 – 3 , 7 . To dissect the molecular mechanisms of the defective migration of Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells , we examined speci ﬁ c factors that might be affected in the cells . Using ﬂ ow cytometry , we analyzed the expression levels of several known migration - related molecules , such as L - selectin ( CD62L ) 26 , 27 and integrin α 4 β 7 28 , 29 , which participate in mediating lymphocyte homing . Interestingly , we observed somewhat higher expression levels of L - selectin , β 7 and α 4 β 7 on Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells as compared to WT littermate control ( Fig . 5d ) . We also cytome - trically examined the surface expression of several chemokine receptors that are known to contribute to lymphocyte migra - tion 30 – 32 . Notably , the exact chemokine receptor ( s ) required for B cell homing to lymph nodes at the genetic level are not well understood , and there may be functional redundancy . We observed higher expression levels of CXCR4 , CXCR5 , CCR7 on Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells as compared to WT ( Fig . 5e ) . It is known that CCR7 , a receptor for both CCL19 and CCL21 , has several sites of O - glycosylation in its N - terminal domain 33 , 34 . Addition - ally , a previous study demonstrated that sialylation and O - glycosylation of CCR5 in its extracellular domain is important for normal chemokine binding 35 . To explore this further , we immunoprecipitated mouse CCR7 and then blotted with PNA lectin , which binds to core 1 O - glycans . The binding of PNA is consistent with the presence of O - glycans on murine CCR7 ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Thus , we reasoned that chemokine receptors in Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells , lacking sialylated extended O - glycans , might have altered chemotactic responsiveness .

These results demonstrate that Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells have impaired chemokine responsiveness . Discussion Multiple factors have been reported in mediating lymphocyte homing to lymphoid organs 1 – 3 , yet little is known about the role of O - glycans in B cell homing . Here we present our discovery that the deletion of Cosmc in murine B cells causes a loss of core - 1 O - glycans , associated with a marked reduction of B cells in PLNs , PPs , and non - lymphoid organs . We found that the loss of Cosmc in B cells disturbs B cell development , and ablates their homing to PLNs , GALTs , and non - lymphoid organs . Our results demonstrate that the rolling and ﬁ rm attachment of Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells in the blood venules were comparable to those of WT B cells , suggesting that extended O - glycans on B cells are not required for those steps . However , Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells exhibit defective responses to chemokines in vitro . Together , these data demonstrate that the transmigration of B cells into lymph nodes requires a functional Cosmc and extended O - glycans . The evi - dence that the traf ﬁ cking pattern of Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells phenocopied that of desialylated B cells supports a role for sia - lylated O - glycans on B cells in normal B cell homing . We also demonstrated that sialidase treatment of lymphocytes impairs their migration to lymph nodes and PPs , and causes them a b d c e f Fig . 4 Sialylation differentially regulates T and B cell traf ﬁ cking .

Strikingly , we found that most of the enriched desialylated lymphocytes in the liver are T cells , with only trace numbers of B cells ( Fig . 4 ) . Thus , the loss of sialic acid differentially affects the traf ﬁ cking of B and T cells to liver , but not other organs . Here we did not explore in great detail the fate of enzymatically desialylated lymphocytes , as such treatments can affect many types of sialylated glycans beyond O - glycans , and even glycolipid glycans . Others have reported that neuraminidase treatment of platelets led to their clearance by hepatic Kupffer cells , which was promoted by the Ashwell – Morell receptor ( AMR ) or asialogly - coprotein receptor 36 , 37 . Thus , it is possible that AMR and / or other unidenti ﬁ ed related hepatic molecules may be involved in the active enrichment of desialylated T cells , but not B cells , in the liver . Interestingly , adhesion and / or migration of naïve subset - speci ﬁ c lymphocytes have been reportedly regulated by the expression level of surface L - selectin , distinctive usage of che - mokine receptors , and possibly other molecules 30 , 31 , 38 – 43 . Our results indicate that sialylation , as a novel mechanism , contributes to this process . Of note , intravascular staining has established that the vast majority of lymphocytes detected in liver and lung are located in the vasculature , but not in the interstitial tissues 44 . In our study , the livers and lungs were perfused with cold PBS , which will likely ﬂ ush away most of the transferred cells in the precapillary vessels . The reduced B cells recovered from transfer experiments thus suggest that , in addition to its pivotal role in mediating lymphocyte to lymphoid tissues , sialic acid on B cells may be important for the retention of B cells in the capillary vessels of non - lymphoid organs . Our results provide novel insights into the roles of B cell O - glycans , which have not been extensively studied previously .

Both Tsyn − / − and C2GnT1 − / − neutrophils showed severely impaired recruitment into in ﬂ amed peritoneum , likely due to a defect in E - selectin binding 12 , 46 . By contrast , upon activation T cells quickly express enzymes generating O - glycans that terminate with the Sialyl Lewis X moiety , which allows the activated T cells to bind to selectins on endothelial cells and eventually promotes T cell extravasation into in ﬂ amed tissues 45 , 47 . However , there have been only a few studies on the potential roles of lymphocyte - expressed O - glycans in B cell biology . For example , similar percentage and numbers of resident B cells found in the lymphoid tissues of C2GnT1 − / − and WT mice indicated that the absence of core - 2 O - glycans on naïve lymphocytes does not affect B lymphocyte migration 12 . Decreased resident lymphocytes in certain PLNs of PPGALNAcT1 - de ﬁ cient mice were identi ﬁ ed , but that seems attributable to reduced L - selectin ligand levels in the lymph node 13 . As global deletion of extended O - glycans causes embryonic death in mice , to achieve B cell - speci ﬁ c deletion of core - 1 O - glycans , we crossed Cosmc ﬂ ox / ﬂ ox mice with mice expressing transgenic Cre - recombinase under the promoter of the Mb1 gene 21 . This approach ef ﬁ ciently generates BC - Cosmc KO mice with a high rate of Cosmc deletion in B cells in the peripheral tissues ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . We observed a clear traf ﬁ cking defect as was manifested in the substantially reduced percentage and numbers of resident B cells in lymph nodes and PPs , whereas B cells were mildly reduced in the spleen and bone marrow ( Fig . 1 ) . A disruption to homing via Cosmc deletion was con ﬁ rmed by both short - and long - term adoptive transfer models . To our knowledge , in regard to single gene knockout models , Cosmc represents the only single gene identi ﬁ ed to date that fully controls B cell traf ﬁ cking to PLNs , GALTs , and non - lymphoid organs . Previous studies have established the critical roles of lymphocyte - expressed L - selectin in initiating rolling 26 , 27 , and β 7 in forming ﬁ rm attachment of lymphocytes in HEVs 28 , 29 . Lack of either molecule , or blockade of their interaction with receptors on endothelium , led to defective lymphocyte traf ﬁ cking 48 – 50 . In addition , chemokine receptors have also been shown to be important to activate integrin 23 , 30 – 32 . When multiple chemokine receptors were desensitized , lymphocytes demonstrated impaired arrest and subsequently reduced homing 30 . We initially specu - lated that lack of extended O - glycans might lead to down - regulation of migration - related molecules . We observed , however , that Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells , possibly through a compensatory mechanism , upregulated their surface expression of L - selectin , integrins , and chemokine receptors ( Fig . 5d ) . This upregulation , however , does not functionally compensate for the de ﬁ ciency caused by the loss of Cosmc during transmigration . It is inter - esting to note that as a consequence of Cosmc deletion , the Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells may reprogram in a sense to overcome the extravasation blockade by upregulating L - selectin , which led to the increase of velocity of B cell during initial rolling . It is clear , however , that none of these potentially compensatory effects can salvage the B cell migration defect resulting from Cosmc deletion . In terms of the mechanism for B cell traf ﬁ cking into lymph nodes , our results demonstrate a key role for sialylated O - glycans in chemokine receptor activity . We recently noted that most chemokine receptors , and especially the subfamily of CC che - mokine receptors ( CCRs ) , have potential O - glycosylation sites in their extracellular N - terminus , and thus could be functionally impacted by the loss of extended O - glycans 51 . For CCR7 , it was reported that sialylation is important for its functions in pro - moting CCL19 induced breast cancer cell growth 52 . In addition , the presence of N - glycans and sialic acid on T cell - expressed CCR7 can modulate its receptor functions 33 . Our results suggest that sialylated O - glycans of CCR7 are required for its functional activity . It is known that CCR7 is O - glycosylated at several sites in its N - terminal surface domain 33 , 34 . The detailed structures of the O - glycans in B cell CCR7 of mouse or human origin remain unknown , but our results suggest that core 1 - type O - glycans occur on murine CCR7 ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . However , we are cautious to interpret the contribution of potential Cosmc - dependent CCR7 - ligand interaction to B cell homing because the presence of CCR7 appears dispensable for B cell migration 39 . But in addition , Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells exhibit impaired response to CXCL12 ( CXCR4 ligand ) , but unaltered response to CXCL13 ( CXCR5 ligand ) . Thus , aspects of known chemokine signaling are clearly impaired in Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells , but the overall func - tional chemokine signaling pathways required to mediate the activation of sequential integrins is poorly understood and remains to be explored in more detail . Re ﬂ ective of that , Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells showed normal attachment to the HEV when measured by IVM . Thus , our results indicate that future studies should explore overall signaling responsiveness in terms of potential O - glycosylation on many migration - related molecules . One such case is human CD99 , which is heavily O - glycosylated and has been shown to be pivotal in mediating the diapedesis of monocytes through endothelial junctions 53 , 54 . At present , however , the homolog of CD99 in mice has not been identi ﬁ ed , but for human B cells it would be informative and worthwhile to investigate the functional con - tribution of O - glycans to CD99 - mediated leukocyte transmigra - tion . Moreover , PNA binding to immunoprecipitated CCR7 ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) also suggests a potentially important role of O - glycosylation in chemotactic responsiveness of lymphocytes , which contributes to the homing defects in Cosmc - de ﬁ cient T cells that we observed in our recent study 14 . So far , no known glycan - binding protein ( GBP ) or lectin other than L - selectin expressed by lymphocytes has been reported to be important in lymphocyte homing to lymph nodes . Thus , future studies should consider the possibility that loss of sialylated O - glycans in Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells might impair B cell interactions with an as yet unidenti ﬁ ed adhesive or signaling GBP that recognizes normal O - glycans . In addition , recent notable technical advances have been made in visualizing how normal lymphocytes undergo transen - dothelial migration 55 . Such novel methodology may reveal more details about the behavioral changes of Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells during their migration through HEVs . In addition , our results indicate a complex regulation of B cell development by Cosmc . BC - Cosmc KO mice showed dynamic changes in frequencies and absolute numbers of B lineage pro - genitors , which suggest that Cosmc is required for the normally progressive development of B cell in the bone marrow . The basis for the upregulation of surface expression of certain B cell subset markers is unclear and further studies are warranted to better understand the roles of Cosmc in regulating B cell development , localization , germinal center B cell response , and other functions . The increase of T cell subsets in the spleen of BC - Cosmc KO mice is also interesting , which could be due to unidenti ﬁ ed lymphocyte homeostasis mechanisms . Considering B cells play a role in T cell priming 22 , 56 , it would be intriguing to examine how the Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells interact with T cells under certain disease settings . Our studies conclusively demonstrate that deletion of Cosmc in B cells alters their development and ablates their ability to migrate to lymph nodes . Particularly , Cosmc - de ﬁ cient B cells are functional to roll and ﬁ rmly attach to endothelium , but defective in their transmigration across the HEV barrier into lymph nodes . Future work is warranted to uncover the O - glycan - bearing molecules on B cells and their potential recognition partners within the endothe - lium .

Methods Mice . Cosmc f / f females were created from our previous work 18 , and crossed with Mb1 - Cre transgenic male mice ( kindly provided by Dr . Michael Reth ) to generate B cell - speci ﬁ c Cosmc knockout line . B cell - speci ﬁ c Cosmc knockout line were co - housed with WT littermate under speci ﬁ c pathogen - free conditions ( 21 . 7 ± 0 . 6°C , 45± 10 % humidity , and 12 - h light cycle 6am – 6pm ) at Harvard Medical School in accordance with approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) protocols ( Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , Harvard Medical School ) . All mice used in this study are male mice at 8 weeks old . All mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide overdose in a euthanasia chamber . Mouse genotypes were deter - mined by PCR with primers for Mb1 - Cre ( hCre dir forward primer 5 ′ - CCCTGTG GATGCCACCTC - 3 ′ , hCre reverse primer : 5 ′ - GTCCTGGCATCTGTCAGAG - 3 ′ ) , and Cosmc ﬂ ox ( Forward primer : 5 ′ - GCAACA CAAAGAAACCCTGGG - 3 ′ , Reverse primer : 5 ′ - TCGTCTTTGTTAGGGGCTTGC - 3 ′ ) . B cell isolation , RT - PCR , and enzyme assays . B cells from WT and BC - Cosmc KO mice were isolated using B cell isolation kit ( Miltenyi Biotec , Cat # 130 - 090 - 862 ) with purity over 92 % as measured by CD19 positivity by ﬂ ow cytometry . Cosmc gene expression was measured by semi - quantitative RT - PCR . Brie ﬂ y , total RNA isolated from WT and BC - Cosmc KO B cells using RNeasy Mini Kit ( QIAGEN Ref # 74104 ) was dissolved in RNase - free water . One microgram of total RNA from both groups was used for the synthesis of ﬁ rst strand cDNA using reverse transcriptase ( SuperScript III , Invitrogen Ref # 18080 - 044 ) . PCR was performed with Phusion High - Fidelity PCR kit ( New England Biolabs ) in a 25 µl reaction system with primers ( Forward primer 5 ′ - ATCACTATGCTAGGCCACA TTAGGATTGGA - 3 ′ , Reverse primer 5 ′ - GGAGGTAAGAAAACCAATGCAT CATTGAAAA - 3 ′ ) . Β - actin was used as loading control ( ACTB Forward primer : 5 ′ - GGCTGATTCCCCTCCATCG - 3 ′ , Reverse primer : 5 ′ - CCAGTTGGTAACA ATGCCATGT - 3 ′ ) . PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1 % Tris - acetate EDTA agarose gel . For T - synthase and α - Mannosidase activity assays , isolated splenic B cells from both WT and BC - Cosmc KO mice were lysed in Tris - Buffered Saline containing 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 and cOmplete - Mini protease inhibitor ( Roche , Ref # 11836170001 ) cocktail on ice . 10 µl cell extract supernatants were added to a ﬁ nal 50µl reaction system , for T - synthase activity , containing 1000 μ M GalNAc - α - 4 - ( MU ) , 500 μ M UDP - Gal , 20 mM MnCl 2 , 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 , 800 units of O - glycosidase , in 50 mM MES - NaOH buffer ( pH 6 . 8 ) , or a 50µl reaction system , for α - Mannosidase activity , containing 100 mM Man - α - 4 - ( MU ) , 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 , 20mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 8 ) , for 45min at 37°C in a 96 - well black plate . Reactions were stopped by adding 100 μ L of 1 . 0M glycine - NaOH ( pH 10 . 0 ) and the relative ﬂ uorescence intensity were measured on a Victor Multiple - Label Counter ( PerkinElmer ) using umbelliferone mode . Antibodies and ﬂ ow cytometry . The antibodies were purchased from BD , Bio - legend , eBioscience , and listed as follows : CD19 , B220 , CD62L , β 7 , α 4 β 7 , CXCR5 , CCR7 , CXCR4 , CD43 , Ly51 CD24 , CD23 , CD21 , IgM , IgD , Thy1 . 2 - PE , or PerCp , or FITC , or PE - Cy7 , or APC - Cy7 , or Brilliant Violet 510 , or Alexa Fluor - 700 , or Paci ﬁ c Blue . Antibodies used in ELISA are from Southern Biotech or Thermo Scienti ﬁ c . Anti - Tn antibody prepared in the lab 57 , was conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 according to manufacturer ’ s protocol ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c A20173 ) . Biotinylated lectins were purchased from Vector Laboratories and incubated with ﬁ nal con - centration at 2µg per ml . Single - cell suspensions prepared from spleen , bone marrow from both femurs , blood , lymph nodes , Peyer ’ s patches , lung , and liver were stained with indicated antibodies at 1 : 100 dilution ( except for α 4 β 7 - PE at 1 : 30 dilution ) on ice ( except for CCR7 - FITC at room temperature ) for 30 min , and run on BD Calibur , or LSR II , or Cyto ﬂ ex . Data were analyzed with FlowJo software . The Gating Strategies used for all ﬂ ow cytometry experiments are shown in Supplementary Fig . 8 ( for Figs . 1 , 3a – c , 4 , 5 , Supplementary Fig . 2 ) and Supplementary Fig . 9 ( for Figs . 2a , c , d , 4a , b , 5a – c , Supplementary Figs . 1A , B , 3A , B ) . ELISA . Sera collected from WT and BC - Cosmc KO mice were titrated and added in duplicate into 96 - well plates ( Corning ) precoated with polyvalent goat antibody against mouse immunoglobulins ( IgM , IgG1 , IgG2b , IgG2b , IgG3 , IgA from Southern Biotech ) , and followed by HRP - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG ( Southern Biotech and Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) and then TMB ELISA substrate ( Abcam ) . Absorbance was measured at 450nm with a Multiskan Spectrum spectro - photometer ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c ) . The mouse immunoglobulin concentration was calculated from a curve constructed using mouse immunoglobulin standard as listed : IgM , IgG1 , IgG2b , IgG2b , IgG3 , IgA ( Southern Biotech ) . Characterization of B cell glycans . Approximately 5 million splenic B cells were puri ﬁ ed , homogenized and extracted . The cells were next lysed and homogenized prior to incubation with DTT ( 1 , 4 - dithiothreitol ) and IAA ( iodoacetamide ) to denature the proteins . After dialysis to remove the DTT and IAA , the proteins were trypsinized ( TPCK - treated trypsin ) and the peptides were recovered and puri ﬁ ed on C18 column . The puri ﬁ ed peptides were treated with PNGaseF to remove the N - glycans . N - glycans and PNGaseF - treated peptides were recovered and puri ﬁ ed on C18 column . The N - glycans were next permethylated and analyze by MALDI - TOF spectrometry . O - glycans were removed from PNGaseF - treated peptides incubation with NaBH 4 . Salts were removed for the preparation with a Dowex 50 W X8 column and co - evaporation with a methanol / acetic acid solution . O - glycans were then puri ﬁ ed on a C18 column , permethylated and analyze by MALDI - TOF spectrometry . MS data were acquired on a Bruker UltraFlex II MALDI - TOF Mass Spectrometer instrument . The re ﬂ ective positive mode was used , and data were recorded between 100 and 6000 m / z for N - glycans , and between 0 and 4000 m / z for the O - glycans . For each MS pro ﬁ le , the aggregation of 20 , 000 laser shots or more were considered for data extraction . Only MS signals matching an N - / O - glycan composition were considered for further analysis . Subsequent MS post - data acquisition analysis was made using mMass 58 , 59 . Characterization of IgG glycosylation . IgG was puri ﬁ ed from three WT and three BC - Cosmc KO mice sera using protein G agarose beads ( Roche ) . Brie ﬂ y , 50µL protein G agarose beads were equilibrated with 2 × 500 µL PBS , followed by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 30 s and removal of the supernatant . 80µL of PBS and 10µL mouse serum were added to the beads and incubated on a shaker for 1h at RT . The beads solution was transferred to empty top tips ( Glygen ) , followed by 3 × 80µL PBS washing steps and IgG elution with 60µL 0 . 1 M glycine - HCl pH 2 . 7 . The elution fraction was neutralized with 6µL 1M Tris - HCl pH 8 . 6 . For subsequent SDS - PAGE 22µL 4x non - reducing Laemmli buffer were added for denaturation at 95 °C for 5min . Each sample was loaded in two lanes ( duplicate MS analysis ) and the cut bands were used for in - gel trypsin digestion as described elsewhere 60 . Next day the supernatant was removed from the gel pieces and 50 µL 50 % acetonitrile were added and incubated on the shaker for 10min at RT . Both supernatants were combined and dried in a speed vac concentrator . The samples were taken up in 20 µL water and diluted 3x in 0 . 1 % formic acid . Two microliters of each sample were used for C18 - reversed phase - liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry analysis ( C18 - RP - LC - MS / MS ) using an Ultimate 3000 nano LC coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer ( both Thermo Fisher ) . Samples were loaded onto a C18 precolumn ( C18 PepMap 100 , 300µm × 5mm , 5µm , 100Å , Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) with 15µL / min solvent A ( 0 . 1 % FA in H 2 O ) for 3min and separated on a C18 analytical column ( picofrit 75µm ID × 150mm , 3µm , New Objective ) using a linear gradient of 2 % to 45 % solvent B ( 80 % acetonitrile , 0 . 1 % FA ) over 39min at 400 nL / min . The mass spectrometer was operated under following conditions : The ion source parameters were 2100V spray voltage and 200°C ion transfer tube temperature . MS scans were performed in the orbitrap at a resolution of 60000 within a scan range of m / z 400 – m / z 1600 , a RF lens of 30 % , AGC target of 1e5 for a maximum injection time of 50ms . The top 15 precursors were selected for MS 2 in a data dependent manner , within a mass range of m / z 550 m / z 1600 and a minimum intensity threshold of 1e5 and an isolation width of 1 . 5 m / z . HCD was performed in stepped collision energy mode of 30 % ( ±5 % ) and detected in the orbitrap with a resolution of 30000 with the ﬁ rst mass at m / z 120 , an AGC target of 2e5 and a maximum injection of 250ms . EThcD spectra were acquired in a product ion - dependent manner ( [ HexNAc + H ] + - ion ) based on the method above . Precursor isolation width was set to 1 . 2 m / z . Calibrated charge - dependent ETD parameters were used with supplemental activation collision energy of 25 % , an AGC target of 2e5 and a maximum injection time of 250ms . Glycopeptide identi ﬁ cation was performed using Byonic version 3 . 5 ( Protein Metrics Inc . ) . Trypsin was set a protease with a maximum of two missed cleavage sites , the precursor and fragment mass tolerance was 10 ppm . The glycan database was “ N - glycan 309 mammalian ” and for O - glycans it contained the Tn antigen and non - , mono - and disialylated core 1 O - glycans . The following modi ﬁ cations were allowed : carbamidomethyl ( Cys ; ﬁ xed ) , oxidation ( Met ; variable , common 1 ) , pyroglutamine on N - term ( Gln ; variable , rare 1 ) , acetylation N - term ( variable , rare 1 ) , deamidation ( Asn ; variable , common 1 ) , formylation N - term ( variable , rare 1 ) . Glycopeptides with a score above 250 were selected and further manually inspected . Relative quantitation of all glycopeptides was performed in an automated manner 61 , 62 . The glycopeptide reference list contained all glycopeptides that were identi ﬁ ed based on MS 2 fragmentation but also lower abundant glycopeptides based on their exact mass , corresponding retention time , isotopic pattern and biosynthetic related glycan composition . Relative intensities were determined in duplicates per mice and averaged , resulting in three data sets for both WT and BC - Cosmc KO . A two - tailed unpaired t - test was performed to compare neutral and sialylated N - glycan classes . The O - glycan distribution of the IgG2b hinge - region tryptic peptide LEPSGPISTINPCPPCK and the mis - cleaved peptide KLEPSGPISTINPCPPCK were averaged for both peptide species . Confocal microscopy . Spleen , lymph nodes , and Peyer ’ s patches were harvested from mice and frozen in OCT at − 80 °C . The frozen tissues were cut at 6 - µm thickness . Sections were air - dried , ﬁ xed with cold 1 : 1 methanol / acetone ﬁ xative for 10 min at − 20°C . After being rinsed 3 times with PBS containing 0 . 05 % Tween 20 , tissues were blocked with 10 % goat serum for 2h and then incubated with NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 17765 - 6 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 3990 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 17765 - 6 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 9 anti - mouse CD19 - PE and anti - Thy1 . 2 - FITC overnight . The sections were then counterstained with Hoechst 33342 and mounted using ProLong gold reagent . Tile scanned images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope and analyzed by ImageJ ( Fiji ) . Homing assays . The in vivo homing assay was performed as described with modi ﬁ cations 63 . Single cell suspensions were prepared from the spleens of donor mice and labeled with CellTrace Violet according to manufacturer ’ s protocol . Internal control wild - type splenocytes were labeled with CFSE . Donor splenocytes ( 2 × 10 7 ) and equal numbers of internal control ( 1 – 1 . 2 × 10 7 ) were intravenously co - injected into recipient mice in a volume of 300 µl of PBS . For some experiments , donor WT and BC - Cosmc KO splenocytes and internal control were co - injected into recipients . An aliquot of the injection mixture was analyzed by ﬂ ow cytometry for the injected ratio of Violet + B220 + ( or CD19 + ) Tn + , or Tn − / CFSE + B220 + ( or CD19 + ) cells ( Ri ) . After either 2 or 20h of migration , single cell suspensions of blood and tissues were prepared and stained with antibodies , and the percentage of CellTrace - Violet and CFSE was determined by ﬂ ow cytometry . The ratio of Violet + B220 + ( or CD19 + ) Tn + , or Tn − / CFSE + B220 + ( or CD19 + ) cells within individual organs or blood ( Ro ) was measured , and the results were presented as the ratio of Ro / Ri in each tissue . Chemotaxis assay . The responsiveness of splenic B cells to chemokines was examined using 6 . 5 - mm Transwell inserts with a 5 - µm pore size ( Corning ) . Fresh single cell suspension from spleen was prepared in complete RPMI1640 and incubated for 30min at 37°C , and resuspended in RPMI with 0 . 5 % BSA ( ~ 10 7 cells / ml ) . 100 µl suspension was placed to each insert in a well containing 580 µl solution of chemokines ( R & D Systems ) with indicated concentration . Migration was allowed for 4h at 37°C . Cells migrated to the lower chamber were collected , counted , and analyzed by ﬂ ow cytometry . Intravital microscopy . Intravital microscopy of the inguinal lymph nodes was done based on previous studies 12 , 64 , 65 . 6 - to 12 - week - old male C57BL / 6J mice were anes - thetized by intraperitoneal injection of 10ml / kg saline containing xylazine ( 10mg / kg ) and ketamine ( 100mg / kg ) . B cells from WT or BC - Cosmc KO male mice were pur - i ﬁ ed by magnetic - activated cell sorting ( Miltenyi Biotec , Auburn , CA ) , labeled with calcein ( Thermo Fischer , USA ) and injected into the cannulated left femoral artery . The cells were visualized in the right inguinal lymph node using a IV - 500 microscope ( Mikron Instruments , Simi Valley , CA ) equipped with an sCMOS camera ( pco . edge 4 . 2 , PCO - Tech Inc . , Romulus , MI ) and stroboscopic epi ﬂ uorescence illumination . Data were recorded on a high speed video recorder ( DVR Express ® Core 2 , IO Industries , Ontario , Canada ) and analyzed as previously described 65 , 66 . Brie ﬂ y , cells were considered noninteracting if they moved at velocities similar to that of red blood cells ( RBCs ) , whereas rolling was de ﬁ ned as cells moving at detectably lower velocities . Sticking was de ﬁ ned as cells that become immobile for more than 30 seconds 63 . After recording , a FITC - dextran solution was injected to visualize the lymph node microvasculature and determine vessel structure and venular order 64 , 65 . Data were analyzed using two - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) with Bonferroni ’ s multiple comparisons , and reported as mean ± SEM . Immunoprecipitation of CCR7 complex and western blotting . CCR7 , Abcam ( Catalog number : ab32527 ) , Protein A / G Magnetic beads , Thermo Scienti ﬁ c ( Product Number : 88802 ) , ECL Anti - mouse IgG HRP linked whole antibody from Sheep ( GE Healthcare Cat # NA931V ) , biotinylated PNA ( Vector Laboratories ) , and streptavidin ( Vector Laboratories ) were used in the experiment . The following dilutions of antibodies and lectins were used : CCR7 ( 1 : 5000 ) , Biotinylated PNA ( diluted to 1µg / ml ) , streptavidin at 1 : 10 , 000 dilution in TTBS . 10 7 splenocytes pooled from three male B6 mice at 8 weeks old were lysed using 700 μ l of NP 40 lysis buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCL , 150mM NaCl , 2mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , and 1 % NP 40 ) containing protease inhibitors . Cells were incubated on ice for 15min and sonicated to break the cells followed by 15min further incubation . Lysates were centrifuged at 13 , 000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C . Supernatant were collected and aliquoted and stored at − 80°C . Two micrograms of anti - CCR7 or control antibody was absorbed on 25 μ L of 50 % Protein A / G Magnetic Beads ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c ) for ~ 2 h at 4 °C ( 25 rpm ) . Washed 2x with 1ml of washing buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 . 5mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 ) for 5min each time . 125 μ L of Lymphocytes extracts from wild - type mice was incubated with the preparation of the anti - CCR7 or control beads for 3 h ( 25 rpm ) at 4°C . Beads were pelleted and washed 3X with the washing buffer . The preparation was divided into two equal halves and one was processed for sialidase treatment as described in the company ’ s protocol . The preparation was treated with 1x sample buffer ( SDS - page ) and boiled for 10 min and the eluted materials was aliquoted and the sample was loaded on SDS - PAGE system ( one half for CCR7 and the other one for PNA staining ) . Samples run on SDS - PAGE gels were transferred onto PVDF membrane by wet - transfer system . Membranes were blocked with 5 % non - fat milk in 1x TBST ( 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ) for 1 h at RT and further incubated with diluted primary antibody ( overnight ) with 1x TBST 5 % non - fat milk . The membranes were washed 2x with 1x TBST for 5 min each followed by incubation with HRP - conjugated secondary antibody prepared in 1x TBST 5 % non - fat milk ( 1 h ) and the membranes were washed 5x with 1x TBST and developed . Signals were detected by using ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent . For PNA , PVDF membrane was blocked with 5 % BSA for 1h . Biotinylated PNA was prepared in 1 % BSA and secondary streptavidin reagents were prepared in 0 . 5 % BSA . Statistics . Unless stated otherwise , Group comparisons were analyzed using an unpaired two - tailed unpaired Student ’ s t test with Prism software . Reporting summary .
