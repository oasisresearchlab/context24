Activation of a ubiq - uitous volume - regulated anion channel ( VRAC ) plays a key role in this process ; however , its molecular identity in vertebrates remains unknown . Here , we used a cell - based ﬂuorescence assay and performed a genome - wide RNAi screen to ﬁnd components of VRAC . We identiﬁed SWELL1 ( LRRC8A ) , a member of a four - transmembrane protein family with unknown function , as essential for hypotonici - ty - induced iodide inﬂux . SWELL1 is localized to the plasma membrane , and its knockdown dramatically reduces endogenous VRAC currents and regulatory cell volume decrease in various cell types . Further - more , point mutations in SWELL1 cause a signiﬁcant change in VRAC anion selectivity , demonstrating that SWELL1 is an essential VRAC component . These ﬁndings enable further molecular characterization of the VRAC channel complex and genetic studies for understanding the function of VRAC in normal physiology and disease . INTRODUCTION The plasma membrane of most animal cells is highly permeable to water . Increases in intracellular osmolality ( e . g . , during trans - epithelial transport , accumulation of osmolytes in metabolically active cells , and ischemic hypoxia ) or decreases in extracellular osmolality will induce a rapid water inﬂux across the cell mem - brane , resulting in swelling of the cell . Multiple mechanisms havebeenpostulatedtocounteracttheswellingandcauseareg - ulatory volume decrease ( RVD ) through ion and osmolyte efﬂux followed by release of osmotically obligated water . For example , swelling - activated K + channels and K + - Cl (cid:1) cotransporters are thought to play arole ( Hoffmann et al . , 2009 ; Lang , 2007 ) . In addi - tion , a large anion - selective current activated by swelling was ﬁrst described in human lymphocytes three decades ago ( Caha - lan and Lewis , 1988 ; Grinstein et al . , 1982 ) and has been subse - quently observed in virtually every vertebrate cell type examined ( Doroshenko and Neher , 1992 ; Jentsch et al . , 2002 ; Nilius et al . , 1994 ; Okada , 1997 ) . Under physiological conditions , this current is primarily carried by chloride anions ( and is commonly referred toas I Cl , swell ) butmayalsomediatepassiveefﬂuxofsmallorganic osmolytes , such as amino acids and their derivatives ( Strange et al . , 1996 ) . The activation of I Cl , swell reduces the intracellular osmolality and constitutes one of the major pathways respon - sible for RVD ( Hoffmann et al . , 2009 ; Lang , 2007 ) . The channel underlying I Cl , swell displays a characteristic biophysical ﬁngerprint including a low ﬁeld strength anion permeability sequence ( I (cid:1) > Br (cid:1) > Cl (cid:1) > F (cid:1) ) , intermediate sin - gle - channel conductance , and a mild outwardly rectifying cur - rent - voltage ( I - V ) relationship ( Jentsch et al . , 2002 ; Nilius and Droogmans , 2003 ; Okada et al . , 2009 ; Strange et al . , 1996 ) . Volume - regulated anion channel ( VRAC ) is also referred to by other names , such as VSOR ( volume - sensitive outwardly recti - fying anion channel ) and VSOAC ( volume - sensitive organic osmolyte anion channel ) . Although the pharmacological and electrophysiological properties of VRAC have been described in detail , its molecular identity has remained unknown ( Hoffmann et al . , 2009 ; Nilius and Droogmans , 2003 ) . Several candidates have been proposed to mediate I Cl , swell , but none have been vali - dated by subsequent studies ( Jentsch et al . , 2002 ; Okada et al . , 1998 ) . The lack of a speciﬁc high - afﬁnity channel ligand hinders direct puriﬁcation of the channel protein . Expression cloning , an otherwise powerful technique for ion channel identiﬁcation ( Hille , 2001 ) , is severely hampered by high endogenous VRAC levels in almost all cell types , including Xenopus oocytes ( Ackerman et al . , 1994 ) . Strong evidence supports bestrophin - 1 ( dBest1 ) as forming the Drosophila I Cl , swell channel ( Chien and Hartzell , 2007 ; Stotz and Clapham , 2012 ) . However , the biophysical prop - erties of this channel are distinct from vertebrate VRAC ( Stotz and Clapham , 2012 ) , and I Cl , swell is unimpaired in murine cells with both mBest1 and mBest2 disrupted ( Chien and Hartzell , 2008 ) . This indicates that bestrophins are unlikely to mediate VRAC in vertebrate cells . Cell 157 , 447 – 458 , April 10 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 447 In this study , we established a cell - based ﬂuorescence assay for hypotonicity - induced iodide inﬂux and performed a genome - wide RNAi screen in HEK293T cells . This strategy has enabled us to identify SWELL1 ( LRRC8A ) , a ubiquitously expressed but poorly characterized transmembrane protein with many leucine - rich repeats , as an essential component of the VRAC channel . We show that SWELL1 is localized to the plasma mem - brane and that its knockdown dramatically suppresses native VRAC currents in multiple cell types . This deﬁcit can be rescued by expression of RNAi - insensitive SWELL1 complementary DNA ( cDNA ) clones . Mutagenesis analysis further suggests that SWELL1 is near or part ofthe pore ofthe VRAC channel complex . RESULTS Genome - wide RNAi Screen Identiﬁes LRRC8A as Essential for Hypotonicity - Induced Iodide Inﬂux To search for genes encoding VRAC or its regulators , we devel - oped a high - throughput cell - based ﬂuorescence assay for I Cl , swell activity in 384 - well format using an automated Fluoro - metric Imaging Plate Reader ( FLIPR ) . HEK293T cells stably ex - pressing the halide - sensitive yellow ﬂuorescent protein ( YFP ) ( Galietta et al . , 2001 ) were ﬁrst stimulated with hypotonic solu - tions for 5 min to elicit a large endogenous I Cl , swell current ( He´lix et al . , 2003 ) . A subsequent addition of NaI triggered a rapid ﬂuo - rescence decrease due to I (cid:1) inﬂux through VRAC ( Figure 1A ) . The degree of ﬂuorescence quenching correlated with the strength of the hypotonic stimulus and reached a peak of (cid:3) 70 % reduction at a ﬁnal osmolality of 215 mOsm / kg ( Figure 1B ; Table S1 ) . The YFP quenching response was strongly inhibited by DCPIB ( 4 - ( 2 - butyl - 6 , 7 - dichloro - 2 - cyclopentyl - indan - 1 - on - 5 - yl ) oxobutyric acid ) , a potent VRAC antagonist ( Decher et al . , 2001 ) , with an IC 50 of 20 . 9 m M ( Figure 1C ) . These data conﬁrm the validity of this assay and indicate a large assay window . Cells transfected with small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) against several previously proposed VRAC candidates ( ICln , CLC - 2 , CLC - 3 , and BEST1 ) ( Hoffmann et al . , 2009 ) showed normal hypo - tonicity - induced YFP quenching responses , similar to cells treated with scrambled siRNA ( Figure S1 available online ) , indi - cating that these proteins are not by themselves required for VRAC activity in HEK293T cells . To identify VRAC molecular components , we performed an unbiased genome - wide RNAi screen with an arrayed siRNA library ( QIAGEN ) targeting 17 , 631 known and 4 , 837 predicted human genes ( Zhang et al . , 2009 ) ( see Experimental Proce - dures ) . We initially focused our attention on proteins predicted to have at least one transmembrane ( TM ) domain ( a feature shared by all ion channels ) . The knockdown of (cid:3) 500 such genes reduced hypotonicity - induced YFP quenching responses to various degrees . From this list , we manually inspected baseline ﬂuorescence and hypotonicity - induced ﬂuorescence changes to eliminate many false positives identiﬁed due to cell death or cell detachment upon knockdown . We picked 51 candidate genes with unknown or poorly deﬁned function and evaluated them in a secondary RNAi screen using smartpool siRNAs ( a mix of four individual siRNAs against different regions of the transcript ) from a different source ( Dharmacon ) . Knockdown of LRRC8A ( l eucine - r ich r epeat - c ontaining protein 8A ) caused a pronounced decrease of hypotonicity - induced YFP quenching ( Figures 2A and 2B ) without affecting the basal ﬂuorescent levels of transfected cells ( data not shown ) . The siRNA - mediated inhi - bition was as efﬁcacious as the VRAC antagonist DCPIB . Atten - uation of quenching responses was observed with individual siRNAs targeting distinct regions of the transcript ( Figure 2C ) , suggesting an on - target mechanism of action of these siRNAs . All siRNAs tested reduced the abundance of the target tran - scripts as assayed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) ( Figure S2A ) . Since LRRC8A ( also called LRRC8 or AGM5 ) appears to encode a protein required for an anion ﬂux in response to cell swelling , we named this gene SWELL1 . SWELL1 Is Required for VRAC Channel Activity in Various Cell Types We next used established conventional whole - cell patch - clamp recording protocols to assay I Cl , swell activity in the presence and absence of SWELL1 ( He´lix et al . , 2003 ; Lewis et al . , 1993 ; Shen et al . , 2000 ) . Three days after transient transfection of HEK293T cells with scrambled siRNA or siRNA against SWELL1 , cells from both conditions revealed similar low background conductance in isotonic solution indicating SWELL1 siRNA treatment had no detectable inﬂuence on cell health ( Figure 3A , Table S2 ) . Hypotonic solutions elicited large increases in Figure 1 .

These currents had characteristics typical of I Cl , swell ( Figures S3A – S3E ) : voltage - independent block by DCPIB , voltage - dependent inhibition by DIDS ( 4 , 4’ diisothio - cyanatostilbene - 2 , 2’ - disulfonic acid ) , largely permeable to Cl (cid:1) ( see Experimental Procedures ) and mild outwardly rectifying . Remarkably , the response of SWELL1 siRNA - treated cells to a hypotonic stimulus was dramatically suppressed ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . To test whether SWELL1 is also essential for VRAC channel activity in other cell types , we investigated I Cl , swell in both HeLa cells and primary human CD4 + T lymphocytes where VRAC was ﬁrst recorded ( Cahalan and Lewis , 1988 ) . VRAC activ - ity in both cell types had similar overall properties to those in HEK293T cells , including moderate outward rectiﬁcation and block by DCPIB and DIDS ( Figures S3F – S3L ) . Once again , we observed a robust suppression of VRAC by targeting SWELL1 through siRNA transfection in HeLa cells ( Figures 3C and 3D ) and lentiviral transduction of short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) in T lym - phocytes ( Figures 3E and 3F ) . Thus , endogenous I Cl , swell with typical VRAC features are dramatically inhibited by SWELL1 knockdown in all three cell types tested . Expression Proﬁle and Localization of SWELL1 SWELL1 ( LRRC8A ) is predicted to contain 4 TM helices and 17 leucine - rich repeats and was ﬁrst cloned from an agammaglob - ulinemia patient who lacked circulating B cells ( Sawada et al . , 2003 ) . A heterozygous mutation , SWELL1 D 91 / + 35 ( 91 C - terminal amino acids were replaced by 35 amino acids encoded by intron sequences ) , was proposed as the cause of the disease . SWELL1 is conserved across vertebrate species and four other homolo - gous family members ( LRRC8B - 8E ) are usually present in their genomes ( Abascal and Zardoya , 2012 ; Kubota et al . , 2004 ) . The functions of SWELL1 and its family members are unknown . However , a recent sequence comparison analysis of their TM domains suggests that they are distantly related to pannexin ion channels ( Abascal and Zardoya , 2012 ) . RNAi knockdown of each of the four SWELL1 homologs had little effect on hypo - tonicity - induced YFP quenching responses ( Figures S2B and S2C ) . This suggests that , unlike SWELL1 , the other members Figure 2 .

Swell1 mRNA was detected broadly in mouse tissues ( Fig - ure 4A ) ( Kubota et al . , 2004 ) , consistent with the ubiquitous pres - ence of the VRAC channel . Relatively high expression of Swell1 was observed in B and T cells , supporting a potential role in im - mune cell function ( Sawada et al . , 2003 ) . If SWELL1 is a compo - nent of the VRAC channel complex , it should be present at the plasma membrane . To examine whether SWELL1 is expressed at the cell surface , we inserted Myc tags at several sites in the gene and transfected the constructs into HEK293T cells . The plasma membrane localization of SWELL1 was detected by immunoﬂuorescent staining in intact ( nonpermeabilized ) cells expressing Myc - tagged constructs with the epitopes inserted after residues 98 ( putative TM1 - TM2 loop ) or 306 ( putative TM3 - TM4 loop ) ( Figure 4B ) . In contrast , Myc tags located at either end of the protein were detected only after cell permeabi - lization ( Figure 4B ) . These data suggest that contrary to previous suggestion ( Sawada et al . , 2003 ) , the leucine - rich repeats of SWELL1 are in the cytoplasm ( Figure 4C ) , conﬁrming a recent bioinformatics prediction ( Abascal and Zardoya , 2012 ) . SWELL1 Does Not by Itself Generate Larger VRAC Currents Given that SWELL1 knockdown inhibited VRAC activation , we tested whether SWELL1 overexpression would enhance I Cl , swell current density . We transiently transfected HEK293T and HeLa cells with pIRES2 - EGFP carrying the human SWELL1 coding sequence ( untagged ) and recorded I Cl , swell from GFP - positive cells in the whole - cell conﬁguration one day later . During hypotonic stimulation to either HEK293T ( Figure S4A ) or HeLa cells ( data not shown ) overexpressing SWELL1 , I Cl , swell was not enhanced compared to that in control cells . On the con - trary , SWELL1 overexpression resulted in decreased VRAC currents when assayed 2 – 3 days after transfection ( data not shown ) . Expression of heterologous SWELL1 ( FLAG - tagged ) in HEK293T cells was veriﬁed by immunoprecipitation followed by western blot with an antibody against SWELL1 ( Figure S4B ) . Note that this SWELL1 antibody was not sensitive enough to detect expression of endogenous SWELL1 in HEK293T or HeLa cells . These results indicate that extra SWELL1 , although detected on the cell surface ( Figure 4B ) , does not by itself generate larger I Cl , swell . I Cl , swell amplitudes were not signiﬁcantly diminished or enhanced upon overexpression of disease mutant SWELL1 D 91 / + 35 ( Figure S4A ) , suggesting that the mutant has no apparent dominant - negative or gain - of - function effect on VRAC activity in these cell lines . SWELL1 Is a Component of the VRAC Channel Complex To exclude the possibility of an off - target effect of SWELL1 knockdown on VRAC activity , we performed cDNA rescue experiments in stable SWELL1 knockdown cells . We transduced HeLa or HEK - YFP cells with lentiviruses carrying a SWELL1 shRNA and established stable knockdown cell lines . We then transiently transfected RNAi - insensitive SWELL1 cDNA clones harboring ﬁve synonymous mutations within the shRNA target sequence and recorded whole - cell currents from transfected cells .

Besides hypotonicity - induced cell swelling , VRAC is also activated by reduced intracellular ionic strength under constant - volume conditions ( Voets et al . , 1999 ) . Consistent with SWELL1 being essential for VRAC activity , a reduction of intracellular ion strength acti - vated DCPIB - sensitive currents in control cells , but not in SWELL1 stable knockdown cells ( Figures S5A – S5C and data not shown ) . Importantly , expression of RNAi - insensitive WT SWELL1 rescued this activity ( Figures S5A – S5C ) . These data conﬁrm that the observed RNAi phenotype is due to silencing of SWELL1 . Expression of RNAi - insensitive SWELL1 D 91 / + 35 in stable knockdown cells failed to generate any I Cl , swell current above the background ( Figure 5A ) , indicating that this mutation is not functional in this assay . We further performed a similar cDNA rescue experiment in stable SWELL1 knockdown HEK - YFP cells using the ﬂuorescence reporter assay . Consistent with the electrophysiological data , expression of WT SWELL1 , but not disease mutant SWELL1 D 91 / + 35 , increased hypotonicity - induced iodide inﬂux compared to vector control ( Figure 5C ) . Our in vitro ﬁndings that SWELL1 D 91 / + 35 mutant lacks VRAC function and exhibits no prominent dominant negative activity suggest that this ion channel might be involved in regulating the maturation of human B cells . Whether the heterozygous mu - tation that expresses the SWELL1 D 91 / + 35 allele causes agamma - globulinemia by simple haploinsufﬁciency of SWELL1 or other possible mechanisms will have to be evaluated in the future ( Sawada et al . , 2003 ) . The evidence thus far suggests that SWELL1 is required for VRAC . SWELL1 could be part of VRAC channel complex ; how - ever , it is also possible that SWELL1 regulates VRAC activity indirectly , for example by controlling channel expression or traf - ﬁcking . To distinguish these two possibilities , we used the substituted cysteine accessibility method ( SCAM ) to identify SWELL1 residues which when mutated to cysteine can react with a thiol - reactive reagent ( Karlin and Akabas , 1998 ) . If such reactions cause acute and irreversible alterations in the channel activity , it would suggest that SWELL1 is an integral component of the VRAC complex . For this purpose , we chose negatively charged membrane - impermeable 2 - sulfonatoethyl methane - thiosulfonate ( MTSES ) and observed no apparent effect of extra - cellular MTSES ( 3 . 33 mM ) on I Cl , swell reconstituted by WT SWELL1 in stable knockdown HeLa cells ( see below ) . This indi - cates that endogenous SWELL1 cysteines accessible from the extracellular side either do not react with MTSES or , if they do , do not interfere with channel activation . We then systematically substituted cysteines individually into all four putative TM domains of SWELL1 . To facilitate the SCAM screen , we took advantage of the ﬂuorescence reporter assay in stable SWELL1 knockdown HEK - YFP cells . We observed a small decrease ( (cid:3) 10 % ) of WT SWELL1 - mediated rescue activity by MTSES application during hypotonic stimula - tion ( Figure 5D ) , which is likely a background response speciﬁc to this assay since no inhibition was detected by electrophysio - logical recordings ( Figures 5E and 5G ) . Of the 76 mutants , 62 produced relatively normal cDNA rescue activities ( deﬁned as > 60 % of the activity mediated by WT SWELL1 ) ( Figure S5D ) . We then screened the 62 functional mutants with MTSES appli - cation , and observed that cysteine replacement of threonine at position 44 ( T44C ) stood out , as MTSES substantially reduced its activity ( Figure 5D ) . Whole - cell patch - clamp recordings of stable SWELL1 knockdown HeLa cells expressing T44C revealed that extracellular MTSES rapidly suppressed T44C - mediated currents ( Figure 5E , bottom ) . The effect persisted after MTSES washout ( Figure S5E ) , consistent with covalent modiﬁ - cation of the protein . MTSES - induced inhibition was more pronounced for inward currents ( Cl (cid:1) efﬂux ) than outward cur - rents ( Cl (cid:1) inﬂux ) ( Figure 5E – 5G ) , which made I Cl , swell more outwardly rectifying . These results , combined with the RNAi study , suggest that SWELL1 is an essential component of the VRAC complex . Ion selectivity of a channel is determined by its pore , or in rare cases , by pore - associated subunits ( Hille , 2001 ) . Thus , the ability to change selectivity by a point mutation would pro - vide strong evidence that SWELL1 forms or is at least very close to the VRAC channel pore . Since a permeability preference of I (cid:1) > Cl (cid:1) is characteristic of VRAC , we estimated permeability ratios ( P I / P Cl ) from the difference in reversal potential ( V rev ) observed where equimolar I (cid:1) or Cl (cid:1) was the only permeant extracellular anion . Endogenous I Cl , swell in HeLa cells and WT SWELL1 - mediated rescue currents in stable knockdown cells were similar ( P I / P Cl : (cid:3) 1 . 3 ) ( Figures 6A and 6C ) , conﬁrming a preference for I (cid:1) over Cl (cid:1) . While V rev in the Cl (cid:1) - containing solution was similar ( Figures 6A and 6B ) , V rev in the I (cid:1) solution for T44C - mediated rescue currents was dramatically shifted to more negative potentials compared to WT SWELL1 - mediated currents and endogenous I Cl , swell in HeLa cells ( Figures 6A and 6B ) . These data indicate that T44C mutant is more perme - able to I (cid:1) than controls ( Figure 6C ) . The shift of V rev in the I (cid:1) so - lution is not dependent on the current density ( Figure S6 ) . We also mutated T44 to an acidic ( glutamic acid , E ) or basic ( argi - nine , R ) residue to determine whether the anion permeability could be altered . Although T44E - mediated rescue currents were similar to controls ( Figures 6A and 6C ) , currents from T44R showed a signiﬁcant reduction of I (cid:1) selectivity ( P I / P Cl : 1 . 15 , Figures 6A – 6C ) . Therefore , data from two independent substitutions argue that T44 has a sizeable impact on anion permeability . The mechanism of how the pore is affected by these mutations ( e . g . , side chain bulkiness or pKa ) is beyond the scope of this current work but these data support the conclusion that SWELL1 is close to or forms the pore of the VRAC channel complex .

No difference in cell volume with or without SWELL1 knockdown was observed prior to hypotonic stimula - tion ( Figure S7A ) , suggesting that SWELL1 is not required for cell volume homeostasis under iso - osmotic conditions . The initial maximum volume increase after exposure to hypotonic solution was also the same in cells transfected with SWELL1 siRNA compared to controls ( Figure 7A , 1 – 3 min ) . However , cell volume recovery was signiﬁcantly slower in cells treated with siRNA against SWELL1 ( Figures 7A and 7B ) . This high - lights an essential function of SWELL1 in maintaining cell vol - ume homeostasis upon hypotonic challenge . The remaining RVD activities are possibly due to residual SWELL1 protein expression and other ion efﬂux pathways , such as swelling - activated K + channels and K + - Cl (cid:1) cotransporters ( Hoffmann et al . , 2009 ) . Besides loss of intracellular electrolytes , hypo - tonicity - induced efﬂux of small organic osmolytes ( such as taurine , an abundant amino acid derivative ) also contributes to cell volume recovery . Although accumulating evidence sug - gests that these osmolytes might be released from cells through the VRAC channel , direct evidence is lacking due to its unknown molecular identity . We observed a sharp increase in the rate of taurine efﬂux after hypotonic stimulation in scrambled siRNA - treated HeLa cells , and SWELL1 knockdown dramatically blunted this response ( Figure 7C ) . We also tested if taurine permeates the VRAC channel ( Manolopoulos et al . , 1997 ) . Hypotonicity - induced whole - cell outward currents were detected in HeLa cells but not in SWELL1 stable knock - down cells when extracellular Cl (cid:1) was replaced by taurine ( Fig - Figure 6 .

See also Figure S6 . ures S7B and S7C and data not shown ) . Expression of RNAi - insensitive WT SWELL1 rescued this activity ( Fig - ures S7B and S7C ) . These data are consistent with VRAC mediating hypotonicity - induced taurine ﬂux in HeLa cells . DISCUSSION Through an unbiased genome - wide RNAi screen , we identify SWELL1 , and show that this multipass transmembrane protein is an essential component of VRAC . The evidence to support this conclusion includes : ( 1 ) SWELL1 expression is required for the endogenous VRAC currents in various cell types , and for regulation of cell volume homeostasis ; ( 2 ) SWELL1 is a plasma membrane protein , and its mRNA is broadly expressed in mammalian tissues and cells ; and ( 3 ) point mutations in SWELL1 cause a signiﬁcant change in a VRAC pore property , speciﬁcally I (cid:1) versus Cl (cid:1) selectivity . The precise relation between SWELL1 and the VRAC channel pore remains unclear . We show that mutations at SWELL1 T44 affect VRAC anion selectivity . Although mutagenesis that causes a change in ion selectivity is often used as evidence that the site is within the pore , potential exceptions to this rule have been reported ( Kaczmarek and Blumenthal , 1997 ) . At least two possi - bilities exist . On the one hand , SWELL1 could be a VRAC subunit closely associated with the pore and required for modulating channel properties , including ion selectivity , similar to KCNE subunits ( MinK family ) of voltage - gated potassium channels ( Kaczmarek and Blumenthal , 1997 ) . On the other hand , SWELL1 could constitute a pore - forming subunit , which would be con - sistent with the prediction that LRRC8 proteins are evolutionarily related to pannexin channels . We conﬁrmed experimentally that SWELL1 indeed contains four TM domains with cytoplasmic N and C termini , which is a basic structural feature shared by a superfamily of evolutionarily distinct and functionally diverse 454 Cell 157 , 447 – 458 , April 10 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . ion channels , including pannexin ( its invertebrate homolog in - nexin ) , gap junction - forming connexin , and more recently identi - ﬁed CALHM ( calcium homeostasis modulator ) families ( Siebert et al . , 2013 ) . Interestingly , T44 of SWELL1 is predicted to be in the external portion of TM1 , and the equivalent regions of con - nexins and pannexins are thought to line part of their pores based on X - ray crystal structure and SCAM analysis ( Maeda et al . , 2009 ; Wang and Dahl , 2010 ) . Other than T44C , cysteine mutants in other regions of the four putative TM domains were not affected upon MTSES application . This could be explained by the low sensitivity of ﬂuorescence assay we used , or the choice of MTSES as cysteine - reactive reagent . It is also possible that the remaining part of the VRAC pore is formed by other sub - units ( see below ) , or other regions of SWELL1 including the extracellular loops , or N or C terminus ( as is the case for both connexins and pannexins ) ( Maeda et al . , 2009 ; Wang and Dahl , 2010 ) . Regardless , our data allow us to conclude that SWELL1 is an essential component of VRAC that is either pore - forming or is closely - associated with the pore . Extra SWELL1 expression , although detected on the cell surface , did not induce larger I Cl , swell . Overexpressing essential subunits of ion channels does not always lead to increased channel activity . There are various reasons for lack of sufﬁciency . For example , it could be due to a limiting factor upstream of VRAC channel activation , such as a putative cell volume sensor ( it is not clear if VRAC itself senses cell volume change ) . Pore - forming ORAI1 ion channel is such an example , which requires the calcium sensor STIM1 to reconstitute store - operated cal - cium channel function ( Cahalan , 2009 ) . Alternatively , SWELL1 could be one of the subunits in a multimeric channel complex . In this scenario , the other subunit ( s ) could be the limiting factor ( s ) during overexpression , like in the case of pentameric hetero - oligomers of ligand - gated ion channels ( Minier and Sigel , 2004 ) . Future studies will determine the full molecular composi - tion of the VRAC channel complex and the precise relation between SWELL1 and the channel pore . In conclusion , the identiﬁcation of SWELL1 as a long - sought VRAC component has allowed us to provide strong support for the contribution of the VRAC channel to cell volume regulation and hypotonicity - induced taurine efﬂux . Besides cell volume regulation , the VRAC channel is also implicated in many other processes including regulation of membrane potential , salt and ﬂuid secretion , glutamate release , cell proliferation , and apoptosis ( Nilius and Droogmans , 2003 ; Okada et al . , 2009 ) . This discovery will now enable further molecular characterization of this ion channel complex , as well as a genetic approach to understand its role in physiology and disease . In addition , our ﬁnding that an essential VRAC component belongs to the evolu - tionarily conserved LRRC8 family raises the question whether other LRRC8 family members are also associated with anion channels or transporters in vertebrate species . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Additional information regarding plasmids , siRNA library , cell culture , qPCR assay , and detailed procedures for western blot and electrophysiology are described in the Extended Experimental Procedures . Hypotonicity - Induced YFP Quenching Assay A cell - based assay using the halide - sensitive YFP ( with H148Q and I152L mutations ) was described previously ( Galietta et al . , 2001 ) . HEK293T cells were transfected with the plasmid carrying the halide - sensitive YFP . Stably transfected and single - cell derived clones ( HEK - YFP ) were isolated by FACS . HEK - YFP cells in 384 well plates were washed and kept in 20 m l / well isotonic solution ( in mM ) : 140 NaCl , 5 KCl , 20 HEPES ( 310 mOsm / kg ; pH 7 . 4 with NaOH ) . A serial dilution of hypotonic solutions was made by omitting NaCl and adding different amounts of mannitol ( Table S1 ) . Osmolalites of all the solutions were measured by Vapor Pressure Osmometer 5600 . We stimu - lated cells with 20 m l / well hypotonic solutions for 5 min , followedby addition of 10 m l / well 200 mM NaI . FLIPR ( Molecular Devices ) recorded ﬂuorescence in each well simultaneously during the assay . The ﬂuorescence reading at 20 s after NaI addition was normalized to that at 5 s before the addition ( set as 100 % ) . ThepercentageofﬂuorescencedecreaseafterNaIadditionwascalcu - lated as the YFP quenching response . All subsequent YFP quenching assays ( except the initial experiment in Figure 1A ) used hypotonic solution ( in mM ) : 5 KCl , 20 HEPES , 90 mannitol ( 120 mOsm / kg ) . For the SCAM screen , we incubated SWELL1 cDNA - rescued cells with 10 mM MTSES in hypotonic solution for 5 min before the regular FLIPR assay described above . For siRNA transfection in384 - well plates , weﬁrst added 20 m lOpti - MEM with0 . 15 m lLip - ofectamineRNAiMAX ( LifeTechnologies ) and1pmolsmartpoolsiRNAs ( Dhar - macon ) to each well , incubated them for 20 min , and added 20 m l of HEK - YFP Figure 7 .

The cells were incubated at 37 (cid:4) C for 3 days before the assay . Genome - wide RNAi Screen The siRNA library ( QIAGEN ) was previously described ( Zhang et al . , 2009 ) . siRNA transfections for a total of 292 plates in HEK - YFP cells were performed as described above except using a GNF robotic system . The hypotonicity - induced YFP quenching response was calculated and then normalized to the plate average ( set as 1 ) . The average score of two duplicates was determined for each well . The well was considered a hit when its score was 2 standard deviations below the mean . For the follow - up RNAi screen , we transfected cells with smartpool siRNAs ( Dharmacon ) against 51 candidate genes encoding putative membrane proteins , and assayed for the hypo - tonicity - induced YFP quenching response . As controls , scrambled siRNA duplexes ( QIAGEN ) were employed . Cell Culture Cells were maintained in standard culture conditions . For siRNA experiments , cells were cotransfected with 25 nM siRNA and 500 ng / ml GFP vector using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Life Technologies ) to identify transfected cells , seeded on 12 mm diameter poly - D - lysine coated glass coverslips ( BD ) in 24 - well dishes , and were recorded 3 days after transfection . For SWELL1 overexpres - sion experiments , 500 ng / ml SWELL1 or SWELL1 D 91 / + 35 pIRES2 - EGFP con - structs or pIRES2 - EGFP vector were transfected and cells were recorded 18 – 30 hr later . Lentivrial shRNA and Stable Knockdown SWELL1 shRNA with the same sequence as the most potent siRNA ( # 1 ) was inserted into pLL3 . 7 and pLKO . 1 vector ( Addgene ) . Lentiviruses were pro - duced by cotransfecting HEK293T cells with SWELL1 shRNA constructs , pMD2 . G , pRSV - REV , and pMDL . RRE following Addgene’s instruction . Pri - mary CD4 + lymphocytes were transduced with SWELL1 shRNA lentiviruses ( pLL3 . 7 based ) using RetroNectin reagent as described by the manufacturer ( Takara ) , and infected cells ( GFP + ) were recorded 3 days after transduction . We used lentiviruses carrying shRNA targeting luciferase gene as controls . HeLa or HEK - YFP cells were transduced with SWELL1 shRNA lentiviruses ( pLKO . 1 based ) , selected with puromycin ( 2 m g / ml ) 48 hr posttransduction for 2 weeks . Stable knockdown cell lines were derived from single - cell col - onies and used for cDNA rescue experiments . Knockdown was assessed by qPCR . Electrophysiology Whole - cellpatch - clamprecordingswereperformedasdescribed ( Dubinetal . , 2012 ) , except that standard methods to achieve low access resistance ( R a ) were performed and solutions were adapted from previous studies ( He´lix et al . , 2003 ; Jackson and Strange , 1996 ; Shen et al . , 2000 ) . Cells were contin - uously perfused with extracellular solution ( in mM ) : 90 NaCl , 2 KCl , 1 MgCl 2 , 1 CaCl 2 , 10HEPES , 110mannitol ( 300mOsm / kg ; pH7 . 4withNaOH ) . Hypotonic solutions ( HYPO ) had the same ionic composition but contained either 10 mM ( HEK293T ) or 30 mM ( HeLa ) or 60 mM ( lymphocytes ) mannitol instead of 110 mM . When HYPO was applied , only one cell was tested per coverslip . Recording pipettes were usually ﬁlled with intracellular solution containing ( in mM ) 133 CsCl , 5 EGTA , 2 CaCl 2 , 1 MgCl 2 , 10 HEPES , 4 Mg - ATP , 0 . 5 Na - GTP ( pH 7 . 3 with CsOH ; 106 nM free Ca 2 + ) and had resistances of 2 – 3 M U . ForlymphocyterecordingsandinitialCl (cid:1) dependencestudies , theintracellular solution contained ( in mM ) : 40 CsCl , 100 gluconate , 1 MgCl 2 , 1 . 93 CaCl 2 , 5 EGTA , 10 HEPES , 4 Na 2 - ATP , 0 . 5 Na - GTP ( pH 7 . 3 with CsOH ) . The reversal potential of I Cl , swell was + 10 . 0 ± 1 . 3 mV ( n = 21 ) where E Cl = + 9 . 5 mV ( 139 mM intracellular Cl (cid:1) ) , and – 18 . 2 ± 4 . 2 mV ( n = 3 ) in gluconate - containing intracellular solution where E Cl = – 16 mV ( 50 . 6 mM intracellular Cl (cid:1) ) , indicating a large contribution of Cl (cid:1) to the currents . For bianionic experiments , recording pipettes contained 140 CsCl / 10 HEPES / 4 Mg - ATP ( required for VRAC activity ) , pH 7 . 3 and 88 Na - X / 10 HEPES / mannitol ( 110 or 30 mM ) , pH 7 . 4 was bath applied , where X was either Cl (cid:1) or I (cid:1) . An agar bridge containing 1 M KCl connected the headstage ground to the bath . Families of currents were elicited by 100 or 840 ms steps from a (cid:1) 50 mV ( 50 ms ) prepulse potential to + 120 to (cid:1) 120 mV in (cid:1) 20 mV increments every 10sto determine voltage - dependentactivation and inactivation proper - ties of currents before and after challenge with HYPO . The holding potential was 0 mV . VRAC currents in HYPO were slowly inactivating at positive poten - tials . Voltage ramps were applied every 5 s from (cid:1) 100 to + 100 mV at a ramp speed 1 . 1 mV / ms . Sampling interval : 50 m s ; ﬁlter : 10 KHz . For the SCAM analysis , solutions containing MTSES ( 0 . 1 – 3 . 33 mM ) were bath applied near the plateau of I Cl , swell for 2 – 5 min . MTSES decreased T44C - mediated rescue currents with a latency of (cid:3) 20 s . The percent block between 30 – 90 s was determined either by ﬁtting the activation curves and comparing the ﬁt current magnitude to the actual data ( when MTSES was applied prior to current plateau ) or by using current values just prior to MTS exposure ( when MTSES arrived during a plateau ) . MTSES was washed out and the current recovery was determined by using either the ﬁtted curve data points or the plateau current data . Data were analyzed ofﬂine using PClamp Clampﬁt10 and GraphPad Prism 6 . P I / P Cl was determined using the equation = exp ( ( (cid:1) ( V rev , I (cid:1) (cid:1) V rev , Cl (cid:1) ) ) * 1 / 25 . 693 ) ( Shen et al . , 2000 ) . The compound error in this difference calculation was determined as described in ( Taylor , 1982 ) . Quantitative Real - Time PCR Total RNAwasreversetranscribedtogeneratecDNA , whichwasthenusedas templates for real - time PCR on ABI 7900HT fast real time system . Gene expression was normalized to GAPDH . Immunostaining Immunostainingwasperformedaspreviouslydescribed ( Schmidtetal . , 2009 ) . Forlive - cellstaining , cellswereincubatedwithanti - Myc ( 9E11 ) antibody ( 1 : 50 ; Santa Cruz Biotech ) at 37 (cid:4) C for 20 min followed by incubation with secondary antibody at room temperature for 10 min . Cells were then ﬁxed with 2 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) . For regular immunocytochemistry , cells were ﬁxed with4 % PFA , incubated with anti - Myc antibody ( 1 : 500 ) for 2hr and secondary antibody for 1 hr . Coverslips were mounted and imaged with Nikon C2 confocal microscope . Western Blot Analysis Immunoprecipitation and western blot were performed by standard protocols with antibodies ( Sigma ) against FLAG tag ( F3165 ) and SWELL1 ( HPA016811 ) . Regulatory Volume Decrease HeLa cells were transfected with 25 nM scrambled siRNA or siRNA against SWELL1 in 24 - well plate using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX . Three days post - transfection , siRNA - transfected cells were digested and suspended in 11 . 5 ml PBS . Cell volume was measured by the Z2 Coulter counter ( Beckman Coulter ) . Cells within the diameter range of 10 – 25 m m ( corresponding to a cell volume range of 524 – 8 , 181 fL ) were counted and the average cell volume of more than 10 , 000 cells in each counting run was recorded . After three measurements , 8 ml hypotonic solution ( the same as used in the RNAi screen ) was added to the cell suspension and a series of measurements was taken untiltherestorationoftheinitialvolumeforcellstreatedwithscrambledsiRNA . The average cell volume one min before the hypotonic stimulus was normal - ized as 1 and the relative average volume at other time points was calculated . RVD time constants were determined using one - phase exponential decay curve ﬁtting ( GraphPad Prism 6 ) . Taurine Efﬂux Assay Taurine efﬂux assay was performed as described previously ( Falktoft and Lambert , 2004 ) . siRNA - transfected HeLa cells in six - well plates were loaded withculturemedium containing [ 3 H ] taurine ( 2 m Ci / ml ) at37 (cid:4) Cfor2hr . Thecells were washed ﬁve times with isotonic solution ( in mM ) : 145 NaCl , 2 KCl , 1 MgCl 2 , 1 CaCl 2 , 10 HEPES , pH 7 . 4 ( adjusted with NaOH ) . Hypotonic solution was made by decreasing NaCl concentration to 95 mM . The experiment was performed by removal / addition of 1 ml aliquots of solutions at 2 min intervals . Theefﬂuxwasinitiatedbyaspirationofisotonicsolutionfollowedbyadditionof hypotonic solution . The cells were lysed at the end of the experiment with 0 . 5 M NaOH . The total 3 H activity in the cells was estimated as the sum of 3 H activity in all efﬂux samples and the ﬁnal lysates using a Beckman Coulter LS 6500 liquid scintillation counter . The natural logarithm to the fraction of 3 H 456 Cell 157 , 447 – 458 , April 10 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . activity remaining in the cells was plotted versus time , and the rate constant for the taurine efﬂux ( min (cid:1) 1 ) at each time point was subsequently estimated as the negative slope of the curve between the time point and the proceeding time point ( Falktoft and Lambert , 2004 ) . Data Analysis Statistical signiﬁcance was evaluated using unpaired two - tailed Student’s t test for comparing difference between two samples .
