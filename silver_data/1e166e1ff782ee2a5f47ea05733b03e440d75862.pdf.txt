Assembly of actin ﬁ laments and microtubules in Nwk F - BAR - induced membrane deformations Charlotte F Kelley , Agata N Becalska , Cristina Berciu , Daniela Nicastro , and Avital A Rodal * Department of Biology ; Brandeis University ; Waltham , MA USA Keywords : actin , F - BAR , microtubule , membrane , Nwk F - BAR domains form crescent - shaped dimers that bind to and deform lipid bilayers , and play a role in many cellular processes requiring membrane remodeling , including endocytosis and cell morphogenesis . Nervous Wreck ( NWK ) encodes an F - BAR / SH3 protein that regulates synapse growth in Drosophila . Unlike conventional F - BAR proteins that assemble tip - to - tip into ﬁ laments and helical arrays around membrane tubules , the Nwk F - BAR domain instead assembles into zigzags , creating ridges and periodic scallops on membranes in vitro . In cells , this membrane deforming activity generates small buds , which can lengthen into extensive protrusions upon actin cytoskeleton polymerization . Here , we show that Nwk - induced cellular protrusions contain dynamic microtubules , distinguishing them from conventional ﬁ lopodia , and further do not depend on actin ﬁ laments or microtubules for their maintenance . Our results indicate new ways in which close cooperation between the membrane remodeling and cytoskeletal machinery underlies large - scale changes in cellular morphology . Rapid membrane dynamics are crucial for many cellular pro - cesses , including endocytosis , intracellular trafﬁcking , cell mor - phogenesis , and cell migration . These events are driven by membrane bending , budding , tubulation , ﬁssion , and fusion , all of which are energetically costly and require cooperation between lipid - remodeling protein machinery and the force - generating cytoskeleton . 1 Fer / Cip4 homology Bin / amphiphysin / Rvs167 ( F - BAR ) proteins are one important class of lipid remodeling factors . These proteins form gently curved , crescent - shaped dimers that directly interact with negatively charged head groups of membrane lipids through their positively charged concave surfaces . 2 Most F - BAR domain - containing proteins characterized to date induce positive curvature ( i . e . curvature toward the protein - decorated leaﬂet of the membrane ) . Two such proteins , CIP4 and FBP17 , have been shown to oligomerize on and form helical scaffolds around membranes , thereby inducing membrane tubu - lation in vitro , and membrane invaginations in cells . 3 However , the mammalian F - BAR Slit - Robo GTPase activating proteins ( SRGAPs ) differ from canonical F - BAR proteins , as they induce negative curvature ( i . e . , curvature away from the protein - deco - rated leaﬂet of the membrane ) , forming invaginations into lipo - somes in vitro and ﬁlopodia - like protrusions in cultured cells . 4 , 5 Interestingly , the F - BAR domain of Syndapin , which is generally thought to induce positive curvature in the form of membrane tubulation , 6 , 7 can also form microspikes or protrusions in cells , potentially through an alternative organization of F - BAR dimers on the membrane ( as proposed by Shimada et al . 2010 8 ) . The mechanisms determining these different activities of individual BAR proteins are not well understood . Further , in addition to directly binding and shaping membranes through their mem - brane binding domains , F - BAR family proteins often interact with regulators of the actin and microtubule networks via addi - tional protein binding domains , connecting the membrane remodeling machinery and the cytoskeleton . 1 The actin and microtubule cytoskeletons are highly dynamic structures that can facilitate intracellular trafﬁc , stabilization and rapid remodeling of cellular membranes . Both actin and microtu - bules are involved in the formation of cellular protrusions includ - ing lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia , and both are closely linked to membrane dynamics , with critical roles in endosomal trafﬁc , receptor diffusion , and vesicle motility . 9 Though clearly impor - tant to many events that require changes in membrane shape and curvature , how the cytoskeleton is mechanistically involved in these events is still unclear . 9 Therefore , investigating the relation - ship between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons and F - BAR domain - mediated membrane remodeling will be critical for understanding how membrane dynamics are regulated in the cell .

However , unlike the canonical F - BAR CIP4 , which oligomerized tip - to - tip into linear ﬁlaments and helical arrays on membranes , 14 Nwk unexpectedly associated tip - to - tip to form zigzag oligomers on Figure 1 . For ﬁ gure legend , see page 3 . e1000703 - 2 Volume 8 Issue 2 Communicative & Integrative Biology lipid monolayers . As a result , the Nwk F - BAR domain created periodic membrane ridges and resultant inter - ridge scallops in vitro , instead of inducing membrane tubules like canonical F - BAR domains . These results suggest that distinct patterns of higher - order organization could determine the membrane remodeling activities of diverse F - BAR family members . To investigate the membrane deforming activity of Nwk in a cellular context , we previously expressed the isolated F - BAR domain in Drosophila S2 cells , which do not express endogenous Nwk . 15 Though this simpliﬁed cellular assay may not directly recapitulate the role of Nwk F - BAR - induced membrane defor - mation tied to endocytosis in synapses , it is an excellent model to test how F - BAR proteins manipulate membrane shape in cooper - ation with the cytoskeleton . We found that the Nwk F - BAR domain induced protrusions from the plasma membrane , in sharp contrast to the canonical F - BARs Syndapin and CIP4 , which induced intracellular tubules . The membrane deforming activity of Nwk depended both on structural determinants at the tips of the Nwk F - BAR dimer ( regions suggested to be important for oligomerization ) , and on electrostatic interactions between the membrane and the concave F - BAR surface . 14 While our previous results indicate a novel form of membrane deformation arising from a canonical Nwk F - BAR membrane interacting surface together with a unique higher order zigzag assembly , they do not directly explain how a ridge and scallop - forming membrane - deforming protein generates protrusions in cells . Nwk - induced cellular protrusions are likely to be complex structures arising from a combination of membrane deformation and associated cytoskeletal remodeling . In control S2 cells , ﬁla - mentous actin ( F - actin ) is present throughout the cell , and con - centrated at the cell periphery . We previously showed that in Nwk - expressing cells , F - actin localizes to Nwk - induced cellular protrusions . We used live cell imaging to show that Nwk F - BAR - induced protrusions were initially formed from small cellu - lar buds and that when actin assembly was blocked using the actin polymerization inhibitor latrunculin B ( Lat B ) , protrusions were arrested at this small bud stage . 14 Here , we found that once protrusions had already formed , they did not retract upon Lat B treatment and actin disassembly . This suggests that actin is required for the formation but not the maintenance of these structures ( Fig . 1A ) . While the SH3 domains of full - length Nwk interact with the actin nucleation - promoting factor WASP , 12 these sequences are not contained in our isolated F - BAR con - struct , and are thus not required for protrusion formation in cells . As no direct link between the Nwk F - BAR and the cytoskel - etal machinery has yet been identiﬁed , one possible explanation is that by inducing membrane curvature , the Nwk F - BAR may alter membrane tension , elasticity or lipid organization , creating an environment more amenable to deformation by the cytoskeletal machinery . 9 To determine if the protrusions induced by Nwk bear similar - ity to conventional ﬁlopodia , we investigated the organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton . Conventional ﬁlopodia are thin cellular protrusions ﬁlled with bundled actin , and are not deeply invaded by dynamic microtubules . 16 , 17 In control S2 cells ( which do not exhibit frequent ﬁlopodia ) , microtubules are concentrated in the central region of the cell , with occasional microtubules extending into the thin lamellipodium ( Fig . 1B ) . In Nwk - expressing cells , mCherry - tubulin - labeled microtubules were present throughout Nwk - induced protrusions ( Fig . 1B ) . Micro - tubules were also visible in protrusions in electron micrographs of Lat B - treated cells , in which the actin cytoskeleton was dis - rupted after protrusions had formed ( Fig . 1C , arrows ) . Finally , the microtubule plus - end tracking protein EB1 - GFP 18 could be seen moving toward the tips of the protrusions ( Fig . 1D and Movies 1 and 2 ) , indicating the presence of growing microtu - bules . Treatment of these cells with the microtubule depolyme - rizing drug nocodazole did not abolish protrusions once they were formed , similar to the results obtained above for the Lat B - treated actin cytoskeleton ( Fig . 1E and F ) . Taken together , our results suggest that Nwk F - BAR is inducing structures in these cells that are mechanistically distinct from ﬁlopodia . These heterologous assays provide clues as to the nature of the interaction between the cytoskeletal machinery and the mem - brane deforming activity of Nwk , and also an exciting new model system for examining the interplay between the actin and micro - tubule cytoskeletons in cells . Membrane - deforming proteins and the force - generating actin and microtubule cytoskeletons must act in concert to create the complex membrane structures and shapes found in cells and tissues . Overall , our data suggest a model in which Nwk zigzag assembly induces plasma membrane ridges and inter - ridge scallops ( in the form of membrane buds ) , which are then ampliﬁed by cytoskeletal forces into long protru - sions ( Fig . 2 ) . While we still need to elucidate how this interplay between lipid deformation and the cytoskeleton contributes to membrane trafﬁc at neuronal synapses , multiple studies have shown that both the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons play critical roles in the same pathways as Nwk in vivo . 19 – 22 Figure 1 ( See previous page ) .

These results suggest that while it is capable of reshaping the membrane on a small scale , Nwk requires the involvement of the cytoskeleton to achieve large scale membrane remodeling . These results support the idea that cellu - lar processes involving dynamic membrane remodeling require a tight partnership between the membrane remodeling and cyto - skeletal machinery , and provide a speciﬁc mechanistic stepping point for future studies of their inter - related functions .

Methods S2 cells were cultured according to standard protocols 23 in Schneider’s media supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and 0 . 1 mg / mL penicillin / streptomycin ( Lonza ) , transfected using Effectene reagent ( Qiagen ) and incubated for 2 d at 25 (cid:1) C . pBI - UAS - Nwk - F - BAR - EGFP , 14 pEB1 : EB1 - GFP , 18 and pMT - mCherry - tubulin 24 have been described previously . Constructs were co - transfected with actin promoter - Gal4 . To disrupt the actin cytoskeleton , Lat B ( Millipore ) was added at a ﬁnal concentration of 125 m M . To disrupt microtubules , Nocodazole was added at a ﬁnal concentration of 150 m M . To evalu - ate the effectiveness of Nocodazole treat - ment , cells were co - transfected with EB1 - GFP and the disappearance of comets in Nocodazole but not in control DMSO - treated cells was conﬁrmed by confocal imaging . S2 cells were spread for 1 h on Conca - navalin A ( ConA , Sigma ) for live cell imaging or before ﬁxation . All confocal imaging was conducted on a Marianas spinning disk confocal system ( 3I , Inc . ) , consisting of a Zeiss Observer Z1 micro - scope equipped with a Yokagawa CSU - X1 spinning disk confocal head and a Quan - tEM 512SC EMCCD camera . For correlative light and electron microscopy , S2 cells were spread on ConA - coated Aclar ﬁnder discs , and trans - fected cells were identiﬁed by ﬂuorescence microscopy , as previously described . 14 To disrupt the actin cyto - skeleton , LatB ( Millipore ) was added at a ﬁnal concentration of 50 m M for 10 minutes . Discs were then rapidly frozen using a Leica HPM - 100 high - pressure freezer ( Leica Microsystem ) and ﬁxed by freeze - substitution as previously described . 14 Samples were then embedded in EMbed 812 - Resin ( EMS ) , trimmed and sectioned to contain the cells of interest . Sections were post - stained with uranyl acetate ( 2 % ) and Reynold’s lead citrate , and inspected on a Morgagni transmission electron microscope ( FEI ) or a Tecnai F30 transmission electron microscope ( FEI ) operat - ing at 300 kV and equipped with a 4 k £ 4 k CCD camera ( GATAN ) .
