By taking contact matrices estimated pre - pandemic , and transforming these using pandemic - era mobility data , epidemiologists attempted to predict the number of contacts individuals were expected to have during large - scale restrictions . This study explores the most effective method for this transformation , comparing it to the accuracy of pandemic - era contact surveys . We compared four methods for scaling synthetic contact matrices : two using ﬁtted regression models and two using “naïve” mobility or mobility squared models . The regression models were ﬁtted using CoMix contact survey and Google mobility data from the UK over March 2020 – March 2021 . The four models were then used to scale synthetic contact matrices—a representation of pre - pandemic behaviour—using mobility data from the UK , Belgium and the Netherlands to predict the number of contacts expected in “work” and “other” settings for a given mobility level . We then compared partial reproduction numbers estimated from the four models with those calculated directly from CoMix contact matrices across the three countries . The accuracy of each model was assessed using root mean squared error . The ﬁtted regression models had substantially more accurate predictions than the naïve models , even when the regression models were applied to Belgium and the Netherlands . Across all countries investigated , the naïve model using mobility alone was the least accurate , followed by the naïve model using mobility squared . When attempting to estimate social contact rates during a pandemic without the resources available to conduct contact surveys , using a model ﬁtted to data from another pandemic context is likely to be an improvement over using a “naïve” model based on raw mobility data . If a naïve model is to be used , mobility squared may be a better predictor of contact rates than mobility per se . .

Introduction The COVID - 19 pandemic led to millions of deaths worldwide ( 1 ) and motivated the implementation of a huge number of non - pharmaceutical interventions in order to control viral transmission , alongside the deployment of large - scale contact surveys and measurement of mobility data across the world . Both contact surveys and mobility data can give us insights into changes in interpersonal contact , which drives transmission . Contact rates are a way of measuring transmission potential and contact surveys can be used to ascertain these rates . Contact surveys are conducted to measure who people come into physical or conversational contact with over a period of time , typically a 24 - hour period . One such survey was the CoMix survey ( 2 ) which began in the UK ( 3 ) , Belgium ( 4 ) and the Netherlands ( 5 ) in 2020 and was subsequently rolled out to other countries in Europe ( 6 ) . The CoMix survey aimed to monitor behavioural changes during the unfolding of the pandemic , with a particular attention at estimating the impact of large scale mitigation strategies , such as lockdowns . Contact surveys provide measures of contact rates , which are used as a proxy of epidemiological risk behaviour , and are often designed so that the results can be directly used to parameterise infectious disease models which take social contact rates as an input ( 7 , 8 ) . Studies such as CoMix undertook repeated social contact surveys during the pandemic , aiming at population representativity . However , these surveys are expensive and difﬁcult to undertake , so data was collected only in a limited number of countries . In early 2020 , several companies started to release aggregated “mobility” data with the stated aim of helping public health professionals to understand behavioural change in response to the pandemic , as mobility is considered a valid proxy of risk behaviour ( 9 ) . In the most common instances , this mobility data quantiﬁed the time spent in different locations by mobile phone users , was made freely available , and covered participants in nearly all countries . These advantages led to the heavy use of mobility data during the pandemic to assess the impact of social distancing measures and to parameterise mathematical models , with Google’s “Community Mobility Reports” ( 10 ) being particularly widely used ( 11 – 14 ) . However , as the use of mobility data as a proxy for social contact rates has not been formally assessed , it remains unclear how precisely to transform relative changes in mobility in different locations into changes in contact rates , and how well such transformations predict measured contact rates . 2 . Materials and Methods In this study , we compare trends in mean contacts recorded in the CoMix social contact survey with Google mobility data and assess the performance of different methods used to relate mobility to social contacts . Speciﬁcally , we investigated the relationship between speciﬁc Google mobility indicators and corresponding contact types from the CoMix dataset for the UK , and developed a series of statistical and mechanistic models to relate the data to one another . We then used these models to estimate contact rates from mobility data for the UK , Belgium , and the Netherlands , in order to estimate the predictive accuracy of each model . Our results serve as a tool for epidemiologists and infectious disease 1 .

All analyses were carried out on anonymised participant data . Additionally , Google mobility data was obtained from publicly available sources ( 10 ) . 2 . 1 . 1Mobilitydata Google’s Community Mobility Reports data uses the median value from a 5 - week baseline period of 02 / 01 / 2020 to 06 / 02 / 2020 to compare changes in the number of visits to speciﬁc services / areas . The raw data is expressed as a percentage change relative to the baseline , e . g . - 50 % for half as many daily visits as during the baseline period and + 100 % for twice as many daily visits as during the baseline period . We transformed this to a scale which expresses the change from baseline as a multiple , e . g . 0 . 5 for half as many visits as compared to baseline and 2 for twice as many visits as compared to baseline . We included the following mobility indicators in analyses that measure the number of visits : ● Retail and recreation ● Grocery and pharmacy ● Public transit ● Workplaces Data is available between 23 / 03 / 2020 to 13 / 10 / 2022 . We were unable to ﬁnd clear information in regard to how Google classiﬁed visits into the above categories ( 15 ) . 2 . 1 . 2Surveydata The CoMix survey collected information on contacts weekly in the UK from 23 / 03 / 2020 to 01 / 03 / 2022 ( 2 ) . The present study includes weekly survey results for the entire study period and subsequent statistical analyses were limited to between 23 / 03 / 2020 to 31 / 03 / 2021 as correlations between mean contact numbers and mobility became weaker in the second year ( see supplementary table S5 . 1 ) . Adult panels at ﬁrst contained 1500 participants , and increased to include 2500 participants from August 2020 . Participants from each panel were surveyed once every 2 weeks , with panels alternating so that each week was covered . Ipsos MORI used quota sampling , for age , gender , and region , to recruit a representative sample of the UK ( 16 ) . The survey followed the design of the 2005 / 2006 POLYMOD survey ( 17 ) with some additional questions . More details on the CoMix survey can be found in Gimma et al . and Jarvis et al . ( 3 , 16 ) . Survey participants were asked to report the number of people they met on the day prior to the survey in various settings . Participants had the option of 2 .

We processed these two contact types differently , as detailed below . Traditionally , social contact surveys report aggregated contact data as contacts having occurred at “home” , “work” , “school” or “other” settings ; the CoMix data was also processed to reﬂect this usual categorisation . We chose to focus on “work” and “other” contacts , as Google mobility does not capture changes in school contacts and residential mobility is measured in such a way that does not allow for comparison to home contacts . We excluded children ' s contacts as they were reported by their parents . We did not assess home contacts as that is more plausibly related to household size as opposed to number of visits . 2 . 2DataPreparation We included participants aged 18 and over , but did not restrict contact ages . As per previous CoMix analyses ( 16 ) , we excluded survey rounds six and seven because of data collection issues due to an ad - hoc change to the questionnaire resulting in fewer contacts reported for those weeks . To average out differences in behaviour between panels , we averaged daily “work” and “other” contacts over a two - week moving window to smooth out panel effects . We reweighted the sample based on age and social class ( see supplementary material for visualisations of how survey participants’ characteristics changed over time ) . This was to ensure that changes in the recruitment process over the course of the survey did not inﬂuence the investigation , and to improve the generalizability of the study . We also reweighted the sample so that contacts made on weekends comprised 2 / 7ths of the total sampling weight . This was done as slightly fewer than 2 / 7ths ( 25 % ) of observations were on a Saturday or Sunday and the number of contacts on these days was generally lower . Occasionally , some participants reported mass contacts in extremely high numbers , such as 3000 and higher . These occasional large mass - contact events introduced substantial noise into our estimates of the mean contact rate over time . To stabilise these estimates , mass contacts were capped at 50 contacts per participant , per date , for each contact type , resulting in the reduction of 6 % in the total number of “work” contacts and of 7 % in the total number of “other” contacts . We capped contacts by randomly sampling 50 contacts in each contact type for each participant for each date , when the contacts were listed as ‘mass’ . Other analyses performed on this data implemented a similar approach and hence for consistency it was applied to this investigation ( 16 ) . 2 . 3StatisticalAnalysis R version 4 . 2 . 1 was used for all analyses ( 18 ) , code and data are available through Github and Zenodo ( see Data Availability Statement ) . We conducted two broad analyses : comparing Google mobility to contact rates , and investigating ways to use Google mobility data to scale pre - pandemic contact rates . Through the second analysis we used four 3 .

The two naïve models are commonly encountered in the literature ( 12 – 14 ) , while the regression approach is less commonly used ( 19 ) and the speciﬁc regression models we analyse are ﬁtted in this paper . The two “naïve” models are based on ﬁrst principles , namely that contacts are either directly proportional to mobility ( “mobility” model ) or to mobility squared ( “mobility squared” model ) . The “mobility” model ( 12 ) assumes that given a visit is made to a particular type of venue , a person makes the same number of contacts . An example of this would be going on a date : the amount of social contact you might have during a date may not strongly depend upon how many other people are going on dates . The “mobility squared” model ( 13 , 14 ) assumes that , given a visit is made to a particular type of venue , the number of contacts depends upon the number of other people making visits to the same type of venue . An example of this might be using public transport , where your risk might depend upon how many other people are using public transport . In other words , the “mobility” model assumes that contacts are made through coordinated activities , and the “mobility squared” model assumes that contacts are made at random with other people at the same venues . For each of the naïve models , a mobility value of 1 corresponds to a relative contact rate of 1 , and the relative contact rate is then multiplied by the pre - pandemic contact rate estimated for a given setting to produce an estimate of the during - pandemic contact rate . The two regression models were ﬁtted to contact rates for the UK as measured by CoMix , with Google mobility as the independent variable . We contrasted two regression models , one with an intercept and linear term ( the “linear model” ) and one with an intercept , a linear term , and a quadratic term ( the “quadratic model” ) . Like the naïve models , the regression models produce an estimate of relative contact rates from an input of mobility , which are then scaled up by a pre - pandemic “baseline” contact rate , or used as a multiplicative factor on a pre - pandemic “baseline” contact matrix , to yield contact rates or a contact matrix . The pre - pandemic “baseline” was provided by estimates for the UK as measured by the 2006 POLYMOD survey ( 17 ) - see supplementary material for a more detailed description . The naïve models were each ﬁtted separately to “work” contacts from 4 .

The four models obtained above were used to predict relative contact rates from Google mobility data for the UK , Belgium , and the Netherlands . To assess the performance of the four models in the context of methods people may use during an emergency when there is no contact data available , we used synthetic contact matrices ( 20 ) . We chose the synthetic matrices to increase generalisability as these matrices are available for 177 countries and therefore can be used in the majority of the countries of the world . These matrices were then scaled by the relative contact rates yielded by each model . We assumed that the estimated relative contact rate we have estimated for adults can be extended to children without adjustment . As this investigation focuses on “work” and “other” we assumed that transmission drivers would be similar for adults and children . From the subsequent scaled matrices , we then calculated the dominant eigenvalues for each fortnight in the study period . In order to translate these results into something understandable , we transformed the dominant eigenvalues into “partial” reproduction numbers . This was done by comparing early ( 07 / 03 / 2020 - 13 / 03 / 2020 ) estimates of R t ( number of secondary infections generated by one infected person ) from the EpiForecast work ( 21 ) and the dominant eigenvalue for the synthetic matrix for ‘all’ contacts for the UK ( 20 ) . This gave us a multiplicative factor to use to transform the dominant eigenvalues we calculated , into partial reproduction numbers . This multiplicative factor was calculated as follows : 𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 = 𝑅 𝑡 𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑑𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑛𝑡 𝑒𝑖𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 . This transformation is done to put our results on a comprehensible scale , but note that in general it is not the case that partial reproduction numbers calculated in this fashion will sum to the overall reproduction number . We assess the accuracy of the four models in predicting partial reproduction numbers both visually and quantitatively , in the latter case using root mean squared error . As a ‘true’ value for the partial reproduction numbers we calculated the partial reproduction number for the CoMix contact matrices for the respective contact type and country . 3 .

As participants were surveyed multiple times , we see that characteristic distributions are slightly different between participants and observations . Overall , characteristics were broadly representative of the British population . Males were slightly underrepresented in the survey . There was also a slightly larger proportion of middle class and lower middle class participants and a slightly smaller proportion of skilled working class and working class participants , when compared to the population distribution . Unemployed individuals appear overrepresented in the survey due to the inclusion of older participants who are likely retired . When restricted to participants under 65 ( see supplementary material ) the proportion of employed versus unemployed matches the population proportions ( which is for those of employment age ) .

Plot A shows mean “work” contacts ( solid line ) and “workplace” mobility ( dashed line ) and plot B shows mean “other” contacts ( solid line ) and “other” mobility ( dashed line ) , over time respectively . In Figure 1 we see similar trends over time between contact rates and mobility metrics when we compare the mean daily number of “work” contacts from CoMix to the number of visits to “workplaces” in Google Mobility , and compare the mean daily number of “other” contacts from CoMix to the “other” visits in Google Mobility ( see methods ) . We can see visually that the correlation between mobility and contacts changes over time , with a notable difference between “work” contacts and “workplace” mobility in the second year of data available . 3 . 2 . 2ComparingMethodsofScalingContacts Here we compare four possible ways of estimating contact rates based on mobility data to determine the most appropriate method to use when contact data is not available . 3 . 2 . 2 . 1Regressionmodels For both “work” and “other” contacts , the models which had the most evidence were the quadratic models as shown by the results of t - tests assessing evidence supporting the quadratic term in the model ( “work” : t - test p - value = 0 . 0009 , “other” : t - test p - value = 1 . 95e - 7 ) . When we compare AIC values , it is shown that both for “work” contacts ( linear regression : - 32 . 43 , quadratic regression : - 42 . 64 ) and “other” contacts ( linear regression : - 29 . 94 , quadratic regression : - 57 . 81 ) the quadratic regression model best ﬁts the data when compared to the linear regression model . However , this was evidence of the best model for 8 .

Figure 2 : Comparison of the four models to contact data from the UK . ( A ) “Work” contacts ; ( B ) “other” contacts . Shaded areas show the conﬁdence intervals for the regression model predictions and the black points show the raw data used in the regression models . The “naïve” curves are calculated by multiplying the mobility for a speciﬁc date by the POLYMOD estimate for that contact type ( “work” for “workplace” mobility and “other” for “other” mobility ) . Figure 2 shows that when using the naïve models ( mobility and mobility squared ) the estimated number of mean contacts is larger than the number predicted by the regression models . We see that the mobility model predicts the highest numbers of contacts , and the mobility squared model appears to closely follow the regression models for “work” contacts but not for “other” contacts . 3 . 2 . 2 . 2Creatingtherelativecontactrate The parameter estimates from the regression models described above were used with the corresponding mobility data ( “workplace” indicator for the “work” models and “other” indicator for the “other” models ) to predict a number of contacts for a given mobility . These were then scaled by the relevant POLYMOD number of contacts . For “work” contacts this was 1 . 95 contacts , and for “other” contacts this was 3 . 48 contacts . Parameter estimates are given in the supplementary material ( Tables S1 - S4 ) . 3 . 2 . 2 . 3ComparingtherelativecontactratestoGooglemobility After scaling the synthetic matrices ( 20 ) , we calculated the dominant eigenvalues of these scaled matrices . We then transformed the dominant eigenvalues into partial reproduction numbers using a multiplicative factor of 0 . 158 , calculated using the formula given in the methods section . 9 .

The model with the smallest root MSE was the linear regression model ( “work” : 0 . 270 , “other” : 0 . 121 ) and , as with the UK and Belgium , the model with the largest root MSE was the naïve mobility model ( “work” : 0 . 595 , “other” : 0 . 693 ) . 4 . Discussion During the COVID - 19 pandemic , mobility data has been widely used to get insights into the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 ( 24 ) . Two main approaches have been used : some studies have tried to establish a relation between mobility and transmission ( 25 ) , while others have been trying to relate mobility to contact rates ( 26 , 27 ) . While the former approach is suitable for identifying the mobility data that better provide insights into epidemic spread ( e . g . mobile phone data ) , the latter approach has the advantage of an easier implementation within mathematical models of infectious diseases ( 28 , 29 ) and is the one we focus our attention on in this work . 11 .

For both “work” and “other” contacts , the mean number of contacts is lower in the second year of the study relative to the corresponding mobility . This may indicate that there was a change in participant behaviour , a change in the relationship between mobility and contacts or a change in participant recruitment . This was the motivation for using the ﬁrst year of data for this investigation . Indeed , the relationship between contacts and mobility is expected to be time - varying and although mobility has been found to be very predictive of social contacts during lockdown in China , this was not the case in the post - lockdown scenario ( 30 ) . Also , several factors such as risk perception do affect both mobility and contacts to a different degree ( 31 , 32 ) , therefore potentially affecting their mutual relationship . We explored different regression models that could quantify the link between mobility and contacts using UK data . We then used the best - ﬁt model to generate synthetic contact data from mobility alone and compared it with the results coming from collected contact data . We then extended this approach to the Netherlands and Belgium , to see how our regression model could be generalizable to other countries . While the quadratic models were best when assessing the model ﬁt itself , there was no guarantee this would hold for out - of - sample predictive accuracy . We then used both model types to create relative contact rates in order to determine which best predicted the behaviour across different countries . When looking at results from the UK , we see that the most accurate approximations to the partial reproduction numbers from the CoMix survey are those produced by the quadratic regression model as seen in ﬁgure 3 ( see supplementary material for further ﬁgures ) . The root MSE is also smaller for the linear model . However , for both Belgium and the Netherlands we see the most accurate approximations are those produced by the linear regression model , as shown in ﬁgures 4 and 5 ( see supplementary material for further ﬁgures ) . The tendency for the linear regression model to provide the most accurate approximations out of sample may be due to the fact that there are periods where no CoMix data is available for Belgium and the Netherlands , however , this is difﬁcult to conﬁrm . For all countries and contact types , using just Google mobility produced the worst approximations , with the mobility squared producing the second worst approximations . This is reﬂected in ﬁgures 3 - 5 , with the mobility approximation being clearly less accurate than any other method as well as having the largest root mean squared error . In addition , for “work” contacts in Belgium and the Netherlands the approximations for any method were not as close to those for the UK . Approximations for the UK are generally better as the models used to form the relative contact rates were created using UK data . As CoMix data was not available for some of the study period outside of the UK it is difﬁcult to determine the accuracy of the predictions made outside of the UK . This also means that residuals ( given in the supplementary material ) and the root mean squared error do not account for predictions in this period as there is no ‘true’ value to compare to . For the times where data was available for Belgium and the Netherlands the countries were for the most 12 .

Therefore , it is difﬁcult to determine whether the accuracy of the approximations would be better or worse when no restrictions were in place . For the UK , when restrictions were not in place the accuracy of the approximations remained consistent with their accuracy during restriction periods . Assuming this is true outside of the UK , then the recommendation would be to use the linear regression model relative contact rate instead of Google mobility , to scale pre - pandemic contacts . This method could also be used to calculate contact matrices outside of the data collection period . This investigation is limited by the fact that Google mobility data is difﬁcult to deﬁne , not much information is available on how the indicators are deﬁned . In addition , CoMix surveys were not available throughout the entire study period for countries other than the UK , this limited the amount we were able to determine the accuracy of the results outside of the UK . A ﬁnal limitation is that the relationship between contacts and Google mobility appears to change in the second year of data ( March 2021 onwards ) particularly in work contacts . It is difﬁcult to determine whether this change was due to mobility data becoming less accurate over time , contact data being less accurate towards the later surveys , or a genuine change in the relationship between mobility in contacts . It was for this reason we decided to focus on the ﬁrst year of data ( March 2020 - March 2021 ) . 4 . 1Conclusions If given the choice between mobility and mobility squared to scale pre - pandemic contacts , the best approximation comes from mobility squared . However , the relative contact rates produced using the parameter estimates given above do provide better approximations than from using mobility data on its own . The results for Belgium and the Netherlands suggest that the linear regression model provides best approximations for partial reproduction number estimates outside of the UK . This investigation is the ﬁrst to compare mobility indicators and contact matrices and shows that mobility data can be improved upon as a method to measure transmission potential . 13 .
