INTRODUCTION The microﬁlament system composed of actin , myosins , and actin - associated proteins has been implicated in a variety of key cellular processes including locomotion , endocytosis , cytokinesis , and morphogenesis ( Fukui , 1993 ; Noegel and Luna , 1995 ) . Among the actin - associated proteins , F - actin cross - linking proteins are believed to play an essential role in the regulation of cell structure and motility , since they participate in the rearrangement and localization of actin ﬁlaments through the formation and stabilization of actin bundles and three dimensional networks ( Furukawa and Fechheimer , 1997 ; Matsudaira , 1991 ; Otto , 1994 ) . To date , eleven different actin cross - linking proteins have been identiﬁed in Dictyostelium , including a ﬁlamin - like protein ( Hock and Condeelis , 1987 ) , spectrin - like protein ( Bennett and Condeelis , 1988 ) , ABP120 ( also termed gelation factor ; Condeelis et al . , 1981 ; Noegel et al . , 1989 ; Fucini et al . , 1997 ) , a - actinin ( Fechheimer et al . , 1982 ; Condeelis and Vahey , 1982 ; Brier et al . , 1983 ; Noegel et al . , 1987 ) , elongation factor 1 a ( Demma et al . , 1990 ) , comitin ( Weiner et al . , 1993 ) , a 30 kDa bundling protein ( Brown , 1985 ) , a 34 kDa protein ( Fechheimer and Taylor , 1984 ; Fechheimer , 1987 ; Fechheimer et al . , 1991 ) , cortexillins I and II ( Faix et al . , 1996 ) , and ﬁmbrin ( Prassler et al . , 1997 ) . One of the major advantages of Dictyostelium as a model organism for studying the microﬁlament system is that a variety of genetic approaches can be used to generate mutants with defects in cytoskeletal components ( Schleicher et al . , 1995 ) . Homologous recombination has been employed to create cells with mutations in one or two actin cross - linking proteins . Single mutants lacking a - actinin ( Schleicher et al . , 1988 ) , gelation factor ( Brink et al . , 1990 ; Cox et al . , 1992 ) , the 34 kDa actin - bundling protein ( Rivero et al . , 1996a ) , and cortexillin I or II ( Faix et al . , 1996 ) are either normal or display moderate defects in the ability to grow , locomote , and complete the developmental cycle . A model of functional redundancy has been previously proposed to explain the limited severity of phenotypes observed in single mutants ( Witke et al . , 1992 ; Rivero et al . , 1996a , b ) . In support of this model , double mutants lacking a - actinin and gelation factor ( Witke et al . , 1992 ; Rivero et al . , 1996b ) , and double mutants lacking cortexillin I and II ( Faix et al . , 1996 ) have been shown to exhibit severe synthetic phenotypes . These results suggest that much remains to be learned about the functions of the multiple actin cross - linking proteins , and that some of the functions of 2737 Journal of Cell Science 112 , 2737 - 2751 ( 1999 ) Printed in Great Britain © The Company of Biologists Limited 1999 JCS0504 The contribution of three actin cross - linking proteins , aa - actinin ( aa A ) , gelation factor ( ABP - 120 ) , and the 34 kDa actin - bundling protein to cellular functions has been studied in three single mutant ( aa A - - , 120 - - , and 34 - - ) and three double mutant ( aa A - - / 120 - - , 34 - - / aa A - - , 34 - - / 120 - - ) strains of Dictyostelium generated by homologous recombination . Strains aa A - - / 120 - - and 34 - - / aa A - - exhibited a reduced rate of pinocytosis , grew to lower saturation densities , and produced small cells in shaking cultures . All strains grew normally in bacterial suspensions and on agar plates with a bacterial lawn . Slow growth under conditions of reduced temperature and increased osmolarity was observed in single mutants 34 - - and aa A - - , respectively , as well as in some of the double mutant strains . Motility , chemotaxis , and development were largely unaltered in 34 - - / aa A - - and 34 - - / 120 - - cells . However , 34 - - / aa A - - cells showed enhanced aggregation when starved in suspension . Moreover , morphogenesis was impaired in both double mutant strains and fruiting bodies of aberrant morphology were observed . These defects were reverted by re - expression of one of the lacking cross - linking proteins . The additive and synthetic phenotypes of these mutations indicate that actin cross - linking proteins serve both unique and overlapping functions in the actin cytoskeleton . Key words : Actin cross - linking protein , Gene replacement , Dictyostelium , Endocytosis , Synthetic phenotype SUMMARY Three actin cross - linking proteins , the 34 kDa actin - bundling protein , aa - actinin and gelation factor ( ABP - 120 ) , have both unique and redundant roles in the growth and development of Dictyostelium Francisco Rivero 1 , * , Ruth Furukawa 2 , Marcus Fechheimer 2 and Angelika A .

In this study , we have generated double mutant strains of Dictyostelium lacking the 34 kDa actin - bundling protein and either a - actinin ( 34 - / a A - ) or gelation factor ( 34 - / 120 - ) , and performed additional characterization of the a A - / 120 - strain described previously ( Rivero et al . , 1996b ) . The effects of single and double mutations in these cross - linking proteins have been examined in a wide spectrum of cellular functions including growth , endocytosis , growth under physiological stress , locomotion , and morphogenesis . The expanded range of growth conditions employed reveals that the 34 - and a A - single mutants show impaired growth under conditions of reduced temperature and hyperosmotic stress , respectively . In addition , the three double mutant strains ( a A - / 120 - , 34 - / a A - , 34 - / 120 - ) all show synthetic phenotypes . Moreover , the three strains show a distinct but overlapping subset of phenotypes consistent with both shared and unique capabilities of the actin cross - linking proteins as proposed in the model of partial functional redundancy . MATERIALS AND METHODS Dictyosteliumstrains and growth conditions Dictyostelium discoideum strain AX2 - 214 , an axenically growing derivative of wild - type strain NC - 4 , is the parent strain for all mutants . The isolation of single mutants lacking the 34 kDa actin bundling protein ( Rivero et al . , 1996a ) , a - actinin , or gelation factor ( Eichinger et al . , 1996 ) , and double mutants lacking both a - actinin and gelation factor ( Rivero et al . , 1996b ) has been previously described . Cells of strain AX2 - 214 ( referred to as wild - type ) and mutant strains were grown in liquid nutrient medium at 21°C with shaking at 160 rpm unless otherwise indicated ( Claviez et al . , 1982 ) . Growth on plates was either on SM agar with Klebsiella aerogenes ( Williams and Newell , 1976 ) , or on nutrient agar plates with E . coli B / r ( Bonner , 1947 ) . Generation of mutants Double mutants 34 - / a A - and 34 - / 120 - were generated by disrupting either the a - actinin gene or the gelation factor gene in the 34 kDa actin bundling protein deﬁcient strain ( Rivero et al . , 1996a ) via homologous recombination using the vectors pDab a 1 . 2 and pDgel 1 . 5 , respectively ( Witke et al . , 1992 ) . pDab a 1 . 2 contains the N - terminal 1 . 2 kb Eco RI fragment of the a - actinin cDNA ( Noegel et al . , 1987 ) , and pDgel 1 . 5 contains an N - terminal 1 . 5 kb Eco RI fragment of the gelation factor cDNA ( Noegel et al . , 1989 ) , both under the control of an actin - 6 promoter and an actin - 8 terminator . Both vectors contain a G418 resistance cassette . To express native or mutated forms of a - actinin in the 34 - / a A - strain , plasmids p a A , pMI , and pMII ( Witke et al . , 1993 ) were introduced by co - transformation with pUCBsr D Bam ( Adachi et al . , 1994 ) , a vector containing a blasticidin resistance cassette . Plasmids pMI and pMII harbor a - actinin genes mutated in EF - hand I or II , respectively . To express the 34 kDa actin bundling protein in the 34 - / 120 - and 34 - / a A - strains , plasmid p34 ( Rivero et al . , 1996a ) was introduced by co - transformation with pUCBsr D Bam . All vectors were introduced as supercoiled DNA by electroporation ( Mann et al . , 1994 ) . Blasticidin ( ICN Biomedicals Inc . , Aurora , OH ) and G418 ( Sigma , St Louis , MO ) were used for selection of transformants . Mutants were identiﬁed by colony blotting ( Wallraff et al . , 1986 ) using a - actinin speciﬁc monoclonal antibody 47 - 62 - 17 ( Schleicher et al . , 1988 ) , gelation factor speciﬁc monoclonal antibody 82 - 471 - 17 ( Brink et al . , 1990 ) , or 34 kDa protein speciﬁc monoclonal antibody B2C ( Furukawa et al . , 1992 ) . Western , southern , and northern blotting SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting were performed as described ( Laemmli , 1970 ; Towbin et al . , 1979 ) using either iodinated sheep anti - mouse antibodies or an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system ( Amersham Buchler GmbH & Co . KG , Germany ) . DNA and RNA were isolated , transferred to Hybond N ﬁlters ( Amersham ) and hybridized as described ( Noegel et al . , 1985 ) . Pinocytosis Quantitative studies of pinocytosis were performed essentially as described previously using the soluble ﬂuorescent marker Lucifer Yellow ( Swanson et al . , 1985 ; Rivero et al . , 1996a ) . Osmotic and temperature stress For the analysis of growth in shaking suspension under stress conditions , cells were grown either : ( a ) in axenic medium at 15°C ; ( b ) in axenic medium supplemented with 30 mM NaCl at 20°C ; or ( c ) in axenic medium supplemented with 115 mM sorbitol at 20°C . To test resistance against osmotic shock , the cells were shaken for 2 hours in Soerensen phosphate buffer with 0 . 4 M sorbitol as previously described , and viability assayed after dilution and plating on SM agar with K . aerogenes ( Rivero et al . , 1996b ) . Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy Cells were ﬁxed in cold methanol ( - 20°C ) . Contact site A and a - actinin were detected using monoclonal antibodies 33 - 249 - 17 ( Berthold et al . , 1985 ) and 47 - 62 - 17 ( Schleicher et al . , 1988 ) followed by incubation with Cy3 - labeled anti - mouse IgG ( Weiner et al . , 1993 ) . Nuclei were stained with 4 ¢ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) . Motility and chemotaxis For quantitative analysis of cell motility and chemotaxis , cells were grown to a density of 2 to 3 · 10 6 cells / ml , washed in Soerensen phosphate buffer , resuspended at a density of 1 · 10 7 cells / ml and starved for 6 hours with shaking . Analysis was performed using an image processing system ( Segall et al . , 1987 ) and a chemotaxis chamber ( Fisher et al . , 1989 ) with a maximum cAMP concentration of 5 · 10 - 8 M ( Brink et al . , 1990 ) . Cell size and cell adhesion Cell size was measured as desribed ( Rivero et al . , 1996a ) . To analyze adhesion , the cells were adjusted to the same total cell volume by resuspending them at an OD 600 of 0 . 9 ( roughly equivalent to a density of 1 · 10 7 / ml AX2 cells ) in 10 ml Soerensen phosphate buffer and were shaken at 160 rpm . As an estimate of the time course of adhesion , changes in optical density ( 600 nm wavelength ) were monitored using a LKB Ultrospec III spectrophotometer ( Pharmacia Biotech , Uppsala , Sweden ) . Adhesion was also assayed by measuring light scattering using the method of Beug and Gerisch ( 1972 ) under standardized shear forces . Development of Dictyostelium discoideum Cells were grown to a density of 2 to 3 · 10 6 cells / ml , washed in 17 mM Soerensen phosphate buffer , pH 6 . 0 , and resuspended at a density of 1 · 10 8 cells / ml in the same buffer . Morphology was studied by allowing 1 · 10 8 cells to develop on 1 . 2 % ( w / v ) water agar or phosphate - buffered agar plates at 21°C . For the analysis of developmentally regulated genes , 0 . 8 · 10 8 cells were allowed to develop on nitrocellulose ﬁlters ( Millipore type HA , Millipore , Molsheim , France ) at 21°C as described ( Newell et al . , 1969 ) . F . Rivero and others 2739 Actin cross - linking protein mutants RESULTS Mutants in F - actin cross - linking proteins The 34 - / a A - and 34 - / 120 - double mutant strains were generated as described in Materials and Methods . The gene disruption events were conﬁrmed using Southern blot analyses ( not shown ) . At the RNA level , shortened transcripts for a - actinin and ABP 120 were detected in the 34 - / a A - and 34 - / 120 - double mutants , in contrast to the ~ 3 kb messages in the wild - type AX2 ( not shown ) . Absence of either a - actinin or gelation factor was conﬁrmed by western blot analyses using monoclonal antibodies 47 - 62 - 17 or 82 - 471 - 17 speciﬁc for a - actinin or gelation factor , respectively ( Fig . 1 ) . The antibodies against both proteins have binding sites located in the amino terminal halves of the respective molecules . Thus , the absence of labeling in the mutant strains suggests that products that might result from translation of the truncated transcripts apparent in the northern analyses do not accumulate . In addition to these new double mutant strains , we have analyzed the following cell lines in this study : AX2 , the wild - type parent strain ; 34 - , the 34 kDa actin bundling protein deﬁcient hygromycin resistant mutant ( Rivero et al . , 1996a ) ; a A - , the a - actinin deﬁcient mutant ( Eichinger et al . , 1996 ; Rivero et al . , 1996b ) ; 120 - , the gelation factor minus mutant ( Eichinger et al . , 1996 ; Rivero et al . , 1996b ) ; and a A - / 120 - , the double mutant deﬁcient in a - actinin and gelation factor ( Rivero et al . , 1996b ) . The 34 kDa actin bundling protein deﬁcient cell line 34 kD - / ura and its parent strain DH1 ( Rivero et al . , 1996a ) have also been included in certain experiments . Table 1 provides information on genotype and nomenclature of the strains used in this study , as well as the strains in which the cross - linking proteins have been re - expressed in the mutants . The absence of a robust sexual genetic system in Dictyostelium does not allow rigorous demonstration that the phenotype segregates with and results from the gene replacement . Reversion of the phenotype in these ‘rescue’ strains provides formal evidence that the phenotype is closely correlated with the designated null mutations . Growth , cell size distribution , and endocytosis of mutant strains Cell growth is the result of the interplay between a variety of cellular processes including ﬂuid or receptor mediated endocytosis , phagocytosis , and cytokinesis . Since the actin cytoskeleton has been shown to be involved in these processes , we have determined growth rates of AX2 and mutant strains under several conditions ( Fig . 2 ) . Under standard laboratory conditions ( shaking at 160 rpm at 20°C ) , double mutants 34 - / 120 - grow normally in suspension in axenic medium , with a doubling time of approximately 10 hours during log phase , and reach saturation at a cell density of 1 . 2 · 10 7 cells / ml . The Fig . 1 . Western blot analysis of double mutant strains 34 - / a A - ( upper panel ) and 34 - / 120 - ( lower panel ) . Total protein from 2 · 10 5 cells was resolved by 10 % SDS - PAGE , blotted onto nitrocellulose , and probed with a - actinin speciﬁc mAb 47 - 62 - 17 or gelation factor speciﬁc mAb 82 - 471 - 14 . Clones 34 - / a A - # 5 and 34 - / 120 - # 4 were chosen for further analyses . Fig . 2 . Growth of wild - type and double mutant strains in axenic medium . Cultures were inoculated with 5 · 10 4 cells / ml and grown at 21°C with shaking at 160 rpm . ( A ) , 100 rpm . ( B ) , or 220 rpm . ( C ) . At 160 and 100 rpm , cultures of 34 - / a A - and a A - / 120 - saturated at lower densities than cultures of AX2 ; a A - / 120 - cells grew with a prolonged doubling time . At 220 rpm , all strains grew with a comparable doubling time and reached high cell densities . For 34 - , a A - , and 120 - single mutants , curves similar to that of AX2 were obtained . For all curves shown in this Fig . each point represents the average of three determinations . 2740 doubling time for double mutants 34 - / a A - was slightly prolonged ( 13 hours ) , and reached saturation at a lower density of 6 · 10 6 cells / ml . The double mutant a A - / 120 - exhibited a prolonged doubling time ( 20 hours ) , and saturated at a lower cell density of 6 · 10 6 cells / ml as previously reported ( Rivero et al . , 1996b ) ( Fig . 2A ) . With shaking at 100 rpm ( Fig . 2B ) , similar doubling times were obtained for all strains except for the a A - / 120 - cells where the doubling time was prolonged to 32 . 5 hours . The cultures reached saturation at slightly lower cell densities with shaking at 100 rpm as compared to 160 rpm , 1 . 0 · 10 7 cells / ml for AX2 and 34 - / 120 - and 4 · 10 6 cells / ml for 34 - / a A - and a A - / 120 - . When cells were grown with shaking at 220 rpm ( Fig . 2C ) , all strains showed a doubling time in the range of 9 to 13 hours and reached densities of up to 1 . 5 · 10 7 cells / ml . Under all conditions in these experiments , growth of the single mutants a A - , 120 - and 34 - was similar to the wild - type AX2 ( not shown ) . The effects of shaking speed may arise from effects on aeration , oxygen availability and energetics in the cultures . Additional analyses are needed to understand this phenomenon in detail . F .

Bar , 10 m m . 2741 Actin cross - linking protein mutants The distribution of the number of nuclei revealed by DAPI staining was comparable among AX2 , the single mutants 34 - , a A - , and 120 - , and the double mutants 34 - / 120 - and 34 - / a A - with most cells being uni - or bi - nucleated ( not shown ) . Abundant nucleus - free particles such as were present in the a A - / 120 - double mutant ( Rivero et al . , 1996b ) were not observed in the other strains . Qualitative examination of cultures of the 34 - / a A - mutants grown in axenic medium suggested that the cells were smaller in size than cultures of AX2 . In a quantitative analysis , the distributions of cell sizes between strains AX2 and 34 - / 120 - were indistinguishable , with diameters of 10 . 8±1 . 7 m m and 10 . 6±1 . 5 m m , respectively ( Fig . 3 ) . In contrast , 34 - / a A - cells were signiﬁcantly smaller with a diameter of 9 . 4±1 . 4 m m ( P < 0 . 001 , ANOVA ) , a characteristic previously reported for the a A - / 120 - double mutant ( Rivero et al . , 1996b ) . This difference is more pronounced when cell surface or cell volume is considered , with 34 - / a A - cells possessing a surface area approximately 76 % and a volume approximately 66 % that of AX2 cells . The ability of mutant strains to perform pinocytosis was assessed by the uptake of the ﬂuid phase marker Lucifer Yellow . Quantitative studies revealed little difference between wild type , the single mutants 120 - , a A - , 34 - , and the double mutant 34 - / 120 - ( Fig . 4 and Rivero et al . , 1996a ) . By contrast , double mutants 34 - / a A - and a A - / 120 - were clearly deﬁcient in ﬂuid phase endocytosis . The alterations in growth in axenic medium of the double mutants 34 - / a A - and a A - / 120 - were closely correlated with the reduced rate of pinocytosis . Since prior work implicates the three cross - linking proteins in this study in the process of phagocytosis ( Furukawa et al . , 1992 ; Furukawa and Fechheimer , 1994 ; Cox et al . , 1996 ; Rivero et al . , 1996b ) , we have analyzed this process in the single and double mutants . Growth curves of Dictyostelium in shaking cultures with E . coli B / r as food source showed a similar doubling time of 3 . 3 to 3 . 8 hours for all strains tested ( Fig . 5A ) . In addition , growth rates on SM - agar plates with K . aerogenes as a food source were similar for all strains tested in this study , with the exception of a A - / 120 - , which grew signiﬁcantly faster ( Fig . 5B ) . This could result from the delayed developmental pattern of a A - / 120 - which favors spreading on the bacterial lawn instead of aggregation and development . These results suggest that there is not a major impediment to phagocytosis in these strains . Yet , the rate of growth in the presence of bacteria as a food source may be a rather insensitive test of phagocytosis , since a A - / 120 - was impaired in a quantitative assay of bacterial uptake ( Rivero et al . , 1996b ) . The presence of an excess of bacterial particles can overcome even a defect in the adhesion of bacteria to the cell surface , as shown by mutants defective in talin ( Niewöhner et al . , 1997 ) . Thus , an impairment of phagocytosis in the 34 - / a A - and 34 - / 120 - mutants is by no means ruled out by these ﬁndings . Prior results indicating a deﬁciency of phagocytosis in the 120 - cell line ( Cox et al . , 1996 ) is a clear difference , and is likely a result of the genetic background of the strains ( Rivero et al . , 1996a , b ) .

Fluorescence intensity was normalized by the total cell protein . Each point represents the average of triplicate determinations . Double mutants 34 - / a A - and a A - / 120 - exhibit a reduced rate of ﬂuid phase endocytosis . Similar results were obtained in independent experiments . Fig . 5 . Phagocytosis of single and double mutant strains . ( A ) Growth in suspension with E . coli as a food source . 5 ml of Soerensen phosphate buffer containing 1 · 10 11 E coli B / r bacteria were inoculated with 5 · 10 4 cells / ml of amoebae . All strains grew with a doubling time of 3 . 3 to 3 . 8 hours . Similar curves were obtained for a A - and 120 - single mutants . ( B ) Growth on agar plates with bacteria as a food source . SM agar plates with K . aerogenes were inoculated with amoebae using a toothpick . Colony diameter was recorded as a measure of the growth rate . The a A - / 120 - cells showed a growth rate higher than AX2 . For a A - and 120 - single mutants , curves similar to that of AX2 were obtained . For all curves shown in this Fig . each point represents the average of three determinations . 2742 Growth with physiological stress Changes in temperature , humidity , and osmolarity pose signiﬁcant physiological challenges to growth and survival of free living organisms . It is conceivable that a role of a protein that is not essential under optimal circumstances in the laboratory may be revealed under certain stress conditions . For this reason , we tested the capability of single and double mutants to survive or grow under conditions of low temperature or high osmolarity . Cultures of wild - type cells grown at 15°C in suspension in axenic medium exhibited a doubling time of 13 . 3 hours and reached cell densities of 3 · 10 6 cells / ml ( Fig . 6A ) . Similar cell densities at saturation but slightly longer doubling times of 17 . 3 and 18 . 5 hours were observed for a A - and 120 - single mutants , respectively . The 34 - single mutants were clearly impaired , showing a prolonged doubling time of 23 . 1 hours and reduced cell density at saturation . The impairment was even more pronounced in double mutant strains 34 - / 120 - and 34 - / a A - , where growth was almost completely abolished . Growth of the a A - / 120 - strain was less severely impaired than the other double mutants showing growth similar to the single mutant 34 - strain . We have previously reported that the double mutant a A - / 120 - exhibited an increased sensitivity towards acute osmotic shock ( Rivero et al . , 1996b ) . In contrast , osmotic stress did not affect cell viability for 34 - , 34 - / a A - , and 34 - / 120 - ( not shown ) . Since the role of a particular actin cross - linking protein in the cytoskeletal rearrangements elicited by acute osmotic stress could differ from its role in the adaptation to sustained altered osmolarity , we tested the ability of the mutant cells to grow in the presence of an increased osmotic content . This was achieved by supplementing the axenic medium with either 30 mM NaCl or 115 mM sorbitol . In the presence of 30 mM NaCl , AX2 as well as single mutants 34 - and 120 - were able to grow to a density of 5 - 6 · 10 6 cells / ml at saturation with a doubling time of about 18 hours ( Fig . 6B ) . Similar results were obtained with the 34 - / ura mutant and its parent strain DH1 ( not shown ) . The a A - cells and double mutants a A - / 120 - , 34 - / a A - and 34 - / 120 - grew only to cell densities approximately half of the wild - type strain , the doubling time being slightly prolonged to 20 hours . In the presence of 115 mM sorbitol , AX2 cultures grew with a doubling time of 13 . 3 hours and reached densities of 3 · 10 6 cells / ml . With the exception of a A - and the double mutant 34 - / a A - , all other strains grew to similar densities , but with prolonged doubling times ( 16 to 20 hours ) . The a A - grew slowly and to a slightly lower density . The double mutant 34 - / a A - was severely impaired , with a doubling time of 28 . 9 hours and saturation at around 1 · 10 6 cells / ml . Growth of 34 - / ura cells was only slightly affected in the presence of sorbitol when compared to the AX3 - derived parent strain DH1 ( not shown ) . F . Rivero and others Fig . 6 . Growth of single and double mutants under stress conditions . Cultures were inoculated with 5 · 10 4 cells / ml and grown with shaking at 15°C ( left panel ) , in the presence of 30 mM NaCl at 20°C ( middle panel ) , or in the presence of 115 mM sorbitol at 20°C ( right panel ) . When cells were grown at 15°C , double mutants 34 - / a A - and 34 - / 120 - were the most severely affected . The cells lacking a - actinin and all the double mutant strains were the most severely affected by the presence of NaCl . In the presence of sorbitol , double mutant 34 - / a A - was the most severely affected . For all curves shown , each point represents an average of three determinations . Table 2 .

During the ﬁrst two half hour periods movement in buffer was recorded whereas during the second two half hour periods a linear cAMP gradient with a steepness of 2 . 5 · 10 - 8 M cAMP / mm was established . Speed , orientation and average turn were calculated for the second ( buffer ) and fourth ( gradient ) half hour periods . Orientation was calculated as the ratio between the distance from the original to ﬁnal position and the total path length , multiplied by the cosine of the angle which forms the track of the cell with the direction of the gradient . Average turn is the average change of direction ( in degrees ) between two subsequent images .

Quantitative analysis of motility and chemotactic behavior of the double mutants 34 - / a A - and 34 - / 120 - using a chemotaxis chamber and a computer controlled image processing system ( Table 2 ) showed that AX2 and both double mutant strains exhibit a similar rate of locomotion ( 8 - 9 m m / minute ) in the absence of cAMP . In the presence of a cAMP gradient , both double mutants showed a slight but signiﬁcant reduction in speed ( 24 . 5 % and 12 . 9 % for 34 - / 120 - and 34 - / a A - , respectively ) as compared to the wild - type strain . The ability to orient in the direction of the cAMP gradient was unaffected . The average turn between successive images , an estimation of the persistence of motility , was signiﬁcantly lower in 34 - / 120 - and 34 - / a A - mutants only during migration in the absence of a chemotactic gradient . This phenotype resembles that of the parent strain 34 - which also exhibited a decrease in the average turn reﬂecting an increase in the persistence of motility ( Rivero et al . , 1996a ) .

( A ) Time course of agglutination of AX2 and double mutant strains in suspension . Cells were resuspended in phosphate buffer at the same total cell volume and assigned a value of 100 % .

Error bars have been depicted in one direction for the sake of clarity . Double mutants 34 - / a A - agglutinate more strongly than AX2 cells . Agglutination of single mutants 34 - , 120 - and a A - ( not shown ) and double mutant 34 - / 120 - did not differ signiﬁcantly from AX2 ; double mutant a A - / 120 - was delayed . ( B ) Accumulation of contact site A ( csA ) glycoprotein during starvation in AX2 and 34 - / a A - cells . Cells were handled as in A and samples were removed at the times indicated for preparation of total cell homogenates . The western blot was probed with csA speciﬁc mAb 33 - 249 - 17 . The agglutination pattern shown in A cannot be explained by changes in the accumulation of csA glycoprotein . ( C ) Cell adhesion of aggregation - competent AX2 and 34 - / a A - cells in the absence or presence of 10 mM EDTA . Cells were suspended in phosphate buffer at the same total cell volume and rotated for 60 minutes in an agglutinometer . Light scattering was determined at the times indicated . Similar results were obtained in independent experiments . 34 - / a A - cells exhibited lower light scattering values , both with and without EDTA , indicating the formation of bigger aggregates . ( D ) Photographs of cell suspensions of the experiment shown in C , taken after 1 hour of rotation in the agglutinometer . Bar , 100 m m . 2744 through both calcium - dependent and EDTA - stable intercellular contacts . The adhesion protein gp24 / DdCAD1 mediates formation of calcium - requiring contacts ( Gao et al . , 1992 ; Knecht et al . , 1987 ; Wong et al . , 1996 ) , while EDTA resistant associations are formed by csA glycoprotein ( gp80 ) ( Müller and Gerisch , 1978 ; Noegel et al . , 1986 ) and gp150 . Adhesion assays were performed to determine whether the cells lacking one or two of the cross - linking proteins would show a defect that might arise from an alteration in the membrane cytoskeleton at the contact sites . Agglutination of cells was assessed by measuring the decrease in the light scattering at 600 nm ( Fig . 7A ) . Neither single mutants 34 - , a A - , and 120 - , nor double mutant 34 - / 120 - differed signiﬁcantly from the wild type . Double mutant a A - / 120 - showed a delay in the time course of agglutination that correlates with the overall delay in the developmental pattern already described for this strain ( Rivero et al . , 1996b ) . Surprisingly , double mutant 34 - / a A - exhibited a pattern of signiﬁcantly stronger agglutination than that of the wild - type strain AX2 ( P < 0 . 005 between 6 and 12 hours , ANOVA ) . Examination under the microscope revealed that aggregates of 34 - / a A - were clearly bigger than aggregates of AX2 . Western analysis of the accumulation of csA glycoprotein showed that changes in the amount of this cell adhesion molecule were not responsible for this agglutination pattern ( Fig . 7B ) . The behavior of aggregation competent 34 - / a A - cells was further conﬁrmed using an agglutinometer so that standardized shear forces are applied to the cells ( Beug and Gerisch , 1972 ) . Cell suspensions were adjusted to the same total cell mass to correct for differences in cell size , since the 34 - / a A - cells are smaller ( Fig . 3 ) . After 1 hour in the agglutinometer , when equilibrium is reached , 34 - / a A - cells showed lower light scattering values than AX2 cells in the absence of EDTA ( Fig . 7C ) , indicating the formation of larger aggregates ( Fig . 7D ) . In the presence of EDTA , aggregates of 34 - / a A - were only slightly bigger than that of AX2 . Thus , the larger aggregate size of the 34 - / a A - may be due to enhanced activity of a calcium - dependent adhesion mechanism . A similar behavior was observed when the cell suspensions were adjusted to the same cell density instead of to the same total cell mass , indicating that the pattern observed arises from an intrinsic property of the cells . Development of double mutant strains The contribution of a - actinin , gelation factor , and the 34 kDa actin bundling protein to the developmental process has been studied in the double mutants 34 - / a A - and 34 - / 120 - . The developmental pattern of the wild - type and mutant cells was examined on phosphate buffered agar , on water - agar , and on nitrocellulose ﬁlters . Under all conditions , early development was unaltered in both mutant strains , with the exception that mounds and slugs were usually of smaller size than that of wild type . However , as development proceeded , aberrant fruiting bodies formed ( Fig . 8 , left panels ) . In 34 - / a A - double mutants , sori were only partially lifted from the substrate , and frequently , the stalk continued to extend upward with a second small sorus at the tip . Fruiting bodies with two sori are occasionally observed in wild - type cells . However , few normal - looking fruiting bodies can be observed among the culminants formed by the 34 - / a A - strain . In 34 - / 120 - mutants , fully developed fruiting bodies were short and squat and possessed a thick stalk . A small proportion of 34 - / 120 - cells do not develop beyond the mound stage . In F .

Cells were plated on phosphate agar and allowed to develop at 21°C . Pictures were taken 40 hours after plating the cells .

On the right , expression of developmentally regulated genes . 0 . 75 · 10 8 cells were allowed to develop on nitrocellulose ﬁlters at 21°C for the times indicated . Cells were washed off the ﬁlters and total RNA was isolated . 10 m g RNA per time point were resolved by gel electrophoresis and transferred to membranes for northern analysis with the corresponding probes . The nomenclature of Loomis et al . ( 1995 ) has been followed for the developmentally regulated genes . 2745 Actin cross - linking protein mutants both double mutant strains , the developmental cycle ends with the formation of viable spores , although at a lower yield than in AX2 . The timing and levels of expression of developmentally regulated genes was examined to assess the progress of distinct stages of morphogenesis . AX2 and double mutant cells were allowed to develop synchronously on nitrocellulose ﬁlters , and RNA was isolated every four hours throughout the developmental cycle ( Fig . 8 , right panels ) . The message for the cAMP receptor 1 ( carA ) ( Klein et al . , 1988 ) and contact site A gene ( csaA ) ( Noegel et al . , 1986 ) were used as probes for the early phases of development . AX2 and 34 - / 120 - did not differ in the pattern of expression of car1 and csaA genes . By contrast , premature and prolonged expression of genes speciﬁc for early development was observed in the 34 - / a A - double mutant . Terminal differentiation into spore and stalk cells was assessed by the expression of prespore and prestalk speciﬁc genes pspA ( Early et al . , 1988 ) and ecmB ( Jermyn et al . , 1987 ) , respectively . The onset of expression was accelerated in 34 - / a A - by comparison to AX2 . In addition , both pspA and ecmB genes were weakly expressed in 34 - / 120 - cells compared to the wild - type strain perhaps due to the failure of a signiﬁcant proportion of cells to differentiate .

( B ) Growth of AX2 and rescue strains of 34 - / a A - in axenic suspension cultures . Growth is restored in all rescue strains . ( C ) Cell size distribution of AX2 , 34 - / a A - , and rescue strains of 34 - / a A - .

( D ) Growth of AX2 , 34 - / 120 - , and 34 - / 120 - R34 in axenic suspension cultures at 15°C . Expression of the 34 kDa protein in the 34 - / 120 - double mutant rescues the cold - sensitive growth phenotype to a level nearly that of AX2 as observed for the 120 - single mutant strain ( compare to Fig . 6A ) . A 2746 Rescue of double mutants by re - expression of the 34 kDa protein or aa - actinin The 34 - / 120 - and 34 - / a A - double mutant cells were transformed with a plasmid that allowed expression of the 34 kDa actin bundling protein to verify that the phenotypes arise from the gene replacement event and not from a capricious mutation arising in the strain . Moreover , the 34 - / a A - mutants were also transformed with plasmids that allowed expression of wild - type or altered forms of a - actinin with mutations in the ﬁrst or second of the calcium binding EF hands ( Witke et al . , 1993 ) . The actin 15 promoter in the plasmids constructed for the rescue experiments is expressed in cells growing vegetatively in axenic culture , but not in vegetative cells growing on bacteria , and only transiently during early development ( Knecht and Loomis , 1987 ) . Thus , we focused on analysis of rescue of the phenotypes observed in axenic vegetative cells . Strains 34 - / a A - R34 and 34 - / 120 - R34 re - expressed the 34 kDa protein at levels slightly lower than the AX2 strain ( Fig . 9A ) . Similarly , strains 34 - / a A - R a A - WT and 34 - / a A - R a A - M2 expressed a - actinin at levels 40 % and 69 % of AX2 respectively , whereas 34 - / a A - R a A - M1 expressed a - actinin at levels similar to AX2 ( Fig . 9A ) . Expression of the 34 kDa protein , or wild - type a - actinin , or the a - actinins mutated in one or the other of the two EF hands resulted in restoration of the growth properties of the 34 - / a A - double mutant to wild - type levels in all cases ( Fig . 9B ) . Cell size distribution was also quantiﬁed ( Fig . 9C ) . Re - expression of the 34 kDa protein , wild - type a - actinin , or a - actinin mutated in EF - hand II resulted in a cell size distribution similar to AX2 . Re - expression of a - actinin mutated in EF - hand I , on the contrary , only partially restored the cell size of 34 - / a A - mutants , yielding a bimodal distribution curve with peaks of similar magnitude corresponding to cells of the size of the double mutant or the wild - type strain . The possibility that the restoration of cell growth and size in 34 - / a A - R a A - M1 and M2 strains was due to integration of the a - actinin expressing vector into the endogenous gene , thereby leading to the production of wild - type a - actinin , was ruled out by Southern blot analysis . Restriction fragments corresponding to the disrupted endogenous gene and the expression vector could be demonstrated in both strains ( not shown ) . Furthermore , immunoﬂuorescence using an a - actinin speciﬁc monoclonal antibody was performed in strains 34 - / a A - R a A - WT , M1 , and M2 to check whether non - uniform levels of expression of the reintroduced protein could account for the partial rescue of the phenotype described above . In all strains rescued by expression of either wild - type or mutated a - actinin , the a - actinin was uniformly expressed in the cell population . Striking differences from cell to cell were not apparent . Strain 34 - / 120 - R34 expressed the 34 kDa protein at levels similar to AX2 ( Fig . 9A ) . The slow growth of the 34 - / 120 - at 15°C was rescued in the 34 - / 120 - R34 cells ( Fig . 9D ) , indicating that this phenotype did arise from absence of the two actin binding proteins , and was not caused by an extraneous mutation in the double mutant strain . DISCUSSION The actin based cytoskeleton , comprised of multiple actins , myosins , and actin associated proteins , is a primary regulator of cell shape and movement in eucaryotic cells . At least 11 different actin cross - linking proteins have been identiﬁed in Dictyostelium discoideum , and null mutations in single highly conserved proteins have been reported to result in little or no phenotype . We have analyzed the phenotypes of single mutant strains 34 - , 120 - , and a A - , and the three double mutant strains 34 - / a A - , 34 - / 120 - , and a A - / 120 - in order to dissect the contributions of the actin cross - linking proteins to cell structure and movement in Dictyostelium . The ﬁndings have been combined with results from other recent studies of these strains ( Fisher et al . , 1997 ; Rivero et al . , 1996a , b ) and collected in Table 3 . We ﬁrst describe the defects in actin dependent functions in vegetative and developing Dictyostelium cells from a cell biological viewpoint , and then discuss our ﬁndings regarding the unique and partially overlapping contributions of actin cross - linking proteins from a genetic and evolutionary perspective . Contributions of the actin cross - linking proteins to speciﬁc processes mediated by the actin cytoskeleton in vegetative cells The actin cytoskeleton has been implicated in endocytosis and / or vesicle transport in previous studies in a number of species including plants ( Lichtscheidl and Foissner , 1996 ) , yeast ( Kübler and Riezman , 1993 ; Mulholland et al . , 1997 ) , and mammals ( Gottlieb et al . , 1993 ; Fath and Burgess , 1996 ) . An actin - dependent component of ﬂuid phase uptake termed macropinocytosis was ﬁrst described in macrophages ( Swanson and Watts , 1995 ) , and subsequently associated with crown shaped structures on the surface of Dictyostelium ( Hacker et al . , 1997 ) . In Dictyostelium discoideum , actin has been found to be associated with biochemically puriﬁed endocytic vesicles ( Adessi et al . , 1995 ) , and treatment of cells with cytochalasin A inhibits ﬂuid - phase uptake in a dose - dependent manner ( Hacker et al . , 1997 ) . Genetic evidence for participation of the actin cross - linking proteins in endocytosis is provided by synthetic phenotypes of the double mutants described in this report ( Table 3 ) . A number of cytoskeletal components have been described in the crown - like structures in Dictyostelium including the 34 kDa actin - bundling protein ( Furukawa and Fechheimer , 1994 ) , coronin ( de Hostos et al . , 1991 ) , and myosin IB ( Novak et al . , 1995 ) , suggesting a participation in the endocytic process . Detailed examination of the endosomal and lysosomal pathways in the myosin I mutants suggests that the action of myosin Is is limited to the internalization step since intracellular movement of the vesicles is not impaired in these mutants ( Temesvari et al . , 1996 ) . In addition , mutations in coronin ( Hacker et al . , 1997 ) or multiple myosin isoforms result in cell lines with strongly impaired rates of pinocytosis ( Novak et al . , 1995 ; Jung et al . , 1996 ) . This impairment of ﬂuid phase endocytosis , in the range of 40 to 60 % , is similar to that reported here for the double mutants 34 - / a A - and a A - / 120 - mutants ( Fig . 4 ) . The correlation between a decreased pinocytotic activity and decreased growth rates and cell density saturation observed for 34 - / a A - and a A - / 120 - was also observed on myosin I mutants ( Novak et al . , 1995 ; Jung et al . , 1996 ; Novak and Titus , 1997 ) suggesting that these traits may both reﬂect a central role of the actin cytoskeleton in these processes . Application of environmental stress in the form of reduced F . Rivero and others 2747 Actin cross - linking protein mutants temperature or hyperosmotic conditions revealed additional roles of the actin cross - linking proteins in the growth of vegetative cells . Absence of the 34 kDa protein was detrimental to growth at reduced temperature ( Fig . 6A and Table 3 ) , an observation that correlates with the enhanced actin cross - linking activity of the 34 kDa protein at low temperatures ( Hellewell and Taylor , 1979 ) . Thus , the 34 kDa protein may maintain structure in the cell cortex at reduced temperature . Cells lacking a - actinin exhibited growth defects under hyperosmotic conditions . These phenotypes were even more profound in the double mutant strains a A - / 34 - , and a A - / 120 - ( Fig . 6B and Table 3 ) . Localization of a - actinin at the contractile vacuole ( Furukawa and Fechheimer , 1994 ) is consistent with slow growth of a - actinin mutants under conditions of altered osmolarity . This model is consistent with the earlier observation that myosin IC is localized at the contractile vacuole and is essential for resistance to hypoosmotic shock ( Doberstein et al . , 1993 ) . In addition , amoebae challenged by hyperosmotic shock form a circumferential ring composed of a contractile cross - linked bundle of actin ﬁlaments ( Aizawa et al . , 1998 ) which may provide a structural explanation for the role of a - actinin in response to elevated osmotic conditions described in this paper as well as the previously described role of myosin II in this process ( Kuwayama et al . , 1996 ) . Osmotic homeostasis is also reported to involve effects on the endocytic pathway ( Steck et al . , 1997 ) , so the salt and sorbitol sensitivity may also reﬂect roles of the actin cross - linking proteins in vesicle uptake and / or traffic . Finally , slow growth of the 34 - / 120 - strain in hyperosmotic media clearly reveals the roles of cross - linking proteins other than a - actinin in adaptation to this form of physiological stress . The synthetic phenotype reveals a function not apparent in either the 34 - or 120 - single mutant strains . Alterations in adhesion , development , and morphogenesis One of the most remarkable features of the Dictyostelium life cycle is the formation of a multicellular fruiting body from single amoebae . This cycle is triggered by starvation and involves cell adhesion , differentiation , and sorting into spore and stalk cells . The actin cytoskeleton is associated with the plasma membrane in vegetative cells , and contributes to formation of specialized cell to cell contact regions in Dictyostelium during development ( Luna et al . , 1990 ) . A number of distinct mechanisms of the association of the cytoskeleton with the membrane have been deﬁned ( Noegel and Luna , 1995 ) . Biochemical and immunochemical studies have shown that in aggregation - competent Dictyostelium cells , the regions of cell - to - cell contact are highly enriched in gp80 ( Choi and Siu , 1987 ) and the 34 kDa protein but not a - actinin ( Fechheimer et al . , 1994 ) . Surprisingly , 34 - cells and a A - cells agglutinated like the wild type , but 34 - / a A - displayed a pattern of agglutination signiﬁcantly stronger than AX2 . The enhanced adhesion was less pronounced in EDTA ( Fig . 7C and D ) so that a calcium - dependent adhesion system such as p24 / DdCAD1 may be involved ( Knecht et al . , 1987 ; Wong et al . , 1996 ) . Aggregation competent cells respond to a cAMP stimulus with a transient increase in intracellular free calcium ( Yumura et al . , 1996 ) that is presumably connected with the rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton preceding the chemotactic movement . Lack of two calcium - regulated actin cross - linking proteins may lead to imperfect regulation , greater stability of actin networks , and more stable cell - to - cell contacts if calcium - insensitive actin cross - linking proteins are recruited to substitute . Evidence on the role of components of the actin cytoskeleton during morphogenesis has been obtained from the study of mutants lacking one or more actin binding proteins . For example , mutants defective in myosin II heavy chain ( Springer et al . , 1994 ) and double mutants defective in proﬁlin I and II ( Haugwitz et al . , 1994 ) , or a - actinin and gelation factor ( Witke et al . , 1992 ; Rivero et al . , 1996b ) are able to differentiate into prespore and prestalk cells , but development beyond the mound stage does not occur . In both myosin heavy chain minus and a A - / 120 - mutants , the defect can be attributed to a weakening of the cortical cytoskeleton that renders the cells unable to generate the protrusive force necessary for sorting out of the populations of differentiated cells ( Shelden and Knecht , 1995 ; Knecht and Shelden , 1995 ; Xu et al . , 1996 ; Rivero et al . , 1996b ) . In the double mutants 34 - / a A - and 34 - / 120 - described here , differentiation into prespore and prestalk cells was not impaired , and development proceeded beyond the mound stage . However , the fruiting bodies formed exhibited aberrant morphologies . The phenotype of the 34 - / 120 - mutant resembles to some extent that of mutants Table 3 .

Tracking the motility of single labeled cells in aggregates composed of mutant cells , or mixtures of mutant and wild - type cells may reveal the steps in morphogenesis that require participation of speciﬁc combinations of actin cross - linking proteins . Calcium signaling to the cytoskeleton : role of the EF hands of aa - actinin Study of the free calcium distribution in Dictyostelium slugs ( Cubitt et al . , 1995 ; Yumura et al . , 1996 ) suggests that calcium does act as a signal mediating changes in the cytoskeleton during development and morphogenesis . A number of possible targets of calcium including protein kinases and actin binding proteins such as the 34 kDa actin bundling protein and a - actinin have been identiﬁed ( Noegel and Luna , 1995 ) . Dictyostelium a - actinin contains two EF - hands at the C terminus that are responsible for the calcium regulation . Biochemical studies indicate that both EF - hands possess different regulatory properties ( Witke et al . , 1993 ) . Inactivation of EF - hand I abolished completely the F - actin cross - linking activity , whereas mutation of EF - hand II rendered a protein still able to cross - link actin in a Ca 2 + dependent manner , although higher Ca 2 + concentrations were necessary for inhibition . In a prior study , it was reported that calcium - insensitive forms of a - actinin were sufficient to provide a - actinin function in a A - / 120 - double mutants ( Witke et al . , 1993 ) . These same calcium - insensitive forms of a - actinin were only partially able to supply a - actinin function to the 34 - / a A - mutants . Expression of a - actinin mutated in EF - hand I in the double mutant 34 - / a A - was not able to completely restore cell size . Expression of a - actinin mutated in EF - hand II restored cell size , despite the fact that the rescue mutant 34 - / a A - RM2 produced slightly less a - actinin than the wild - type strain . The same applies for the rescue with wild - type a - actinin , although in this case the comparatively lower levels of the expressed protein could well account for the shoulder towards cells of small size apparent in the distribution curve . It is interesting to note that expression of any of the a - actinin forms , either mutated or not , was sufficient to restore the growth rate in axenic medium , presumably overcoming the pinocytosis defect . This would imply that a - actinin mutated in EF - hand I displays some actin - binding activity , and in fact , residual binding has been described in isolated actin - binding regions of a - actinin ( Witke et al . , 1993 ; Way et al . , 1992 ) . One interpretation of these ﬁndings is that the essential contribution of calcium - regulated actin cross - linking was clearly revealed in the 34 - / a A - mutants which lack both of the calcium - regulated cross - linking proteins . By contrast , calcium - regulated cross - linking of actin ﬁlaments could be supplied either by a - actinin or by the 34 kDa protein in wild type , single mutants , or a A - / 120 - double mutants . However , the requirement for calcium - regulated cross - linking was apparent due to the incomplete restoration of function in the 34 - / a A - by expression of the a - actinin mutated in the ﬁrst EF - hand . Synthetic phenotypes reveal unique and redundant functions of genes The simple paradigm of classical genetics is that mutations in genes yield phenotypes that reveal the function of the gene product . The paradigm suggests a product of no value or function if the null mutation produces no phenotype . In eucaryotes , this occurs with high frequency . For example , it has been estimated that only 5 % of null mutations are lethal and that 66 % of null mutations in the non - essential genes produce no phenotype ( Oliver , 1992 ) . The paradigm is resurrected if we posit that the phenotype observed reveals only the subset of the contributions of the gene product which are unique . Cells lacking the 34 kDa protein , a - actinin , and gelation factor all show speciﬁc defects indicating the presence of some unique functions ( Table 3 ) . The 34 - cells , a A - cells , and 120 - cells show defects in cold sensitivity and persistence of motility , salt and sorbitol sensitivity , and phototaxis , respectively . These results indicate that the ability to overcome physical stress and / or to respond to environmental signals may provide a driving force for the evolution and maintenance of these diverse actin binding proteins . Redundancy , operationally deﬁned as synthetic phenotypes in the double mutants of these three actin cross - linking proteins , is observed in each of the three double mutant cell lines studied ( Table 3 ) . Redundancy is apparent in the 34 - / a A - strain in the phenotypes of growth at 20°C , cell size , ﬂuid phase uptake , sorbitol sensitivity , adhesion , gene expression , and morphogenesis . Redundancy is apparent in the 34 - / 120 - strain in the phenotypes of salt sensitivity , and morphogenesis . Redundancy is apparent in the a A - / 120 - strain in the phenotypes of growth at 20°C , pinocytosis , cell size , motility , adhesion , gene expression , and morphogenesis . The three double mutant strains exhibit different combinations of redundant phenotypes so that the functions of the three actin cross - linking proteins would appear to overlap with each of the others in distinct arenas of actin - dependent processes . These data are evidence for both the unique and overlapping functions of the actin cross - linking proteins 34 kDa protein , a - actinin , and gelation factor , and provide a clear rationale for selection and maintenance of these multiple actin cross - linking proteins . In a number of species including yeast , Drosophila , C . elegans , and mouse , it has been found that double and triple mutations produce synthetic phenotypes in which there is a synergy or greater than additive effect ( reviewed by Guarente , 1993 ) . This can arise due to mutations in molecules that have either only a very distant / indirect relationship , or molecules that contribute at different steps along a linear pathway , or that have similar and overlapping functions . In the latter case , the phenomenon is termed genetic redundancy ( Thomas , 1993 ) . Evolution of redundancy has been postulated to occur through gene duplication , and / or by a process whereby a molecule which performs one function is altered to acquire the ability to perform a new function overlapping with that of another gene product ( Brookﬁeld , 1997 ; Tautz , 1992 ) . In this scenario , the most ancient processes are predicted to be among the most highly redundant . Redundant genes with complete overlap would not be predicted to be evolutionarily stable , since no selection against accumulation of deleterious mutations would be predicted to occur ( Nowak et al . , 1997 ) . Redundant genes can be stably maintained if there is a difference in the genetic ﬁtness or lack of complete overlap of the functions of the two genes . In addition , a driving force for maintenance of redundancy can arise from a high error rate during a given F . Rivero and others 2749 Actin cross - linking protein mutants process such as development and morphogenesis ( Nowak et al . , 1997 ; Thomas , 1993 ) . Our studies reveal both unique and overlapping functions of the 34 kDa protein , a - actinin , and the gelation factor in Dictyostelium . In the broad context of evolutionary theory , the ﬁnding of partial redundancy among the actin cross - linking proteins of Dictyostelium is more expected than surprising . Moreover , virtually all eucaryotic cells contain multiple actin cross - linking proteins that may have partially overlapping functions . For example , in the budding yeast S . cerevisiae single mutants lacking actin cross - linking proteins Abp1p and Sac6p ( ﬁmbrin ) are normal or mildly affected , while double mutants lacking both proteins are either inviable or grow extremely slowly ( Adams et al . , 1993 ) . In the ﬁssion yeast S . pombe , a - actinin and ﬁmbrin are both present along with actin in a medial ring at the site of division . Single mutants grow and divide normally , but double mutants lacking ﬁmbrin and a - actinin are synthetically lethal with defects in medial ring formation and cytokinesis ( J . - Q . Wu , J . Bähler and J . R . Pringle , personal communication ) . In the mammalian brush border , three different actin cross - linking proteins , villin , ﬁmbrin , and small espin are all present in the microﬁlament core bundle ( Bartles et al . , 1998 ) . There is likely some redundancy of function among these three cross - linking proteins , as homozygous villin - deﬁcient mice are viable , fertile , and exhibit no gross abnormalities ( Pinson et al . , 1998 ) . Finally , two actin cross - linking proteins , fascin and forked , both contribute to formation of actin bundles during bristle morphogenesis in Drosophila ( Tilney et al . , 1995 , 1998 ) . Here distinct functions of the two proteins have been assigned based primarily on the ultrastructure of the abnormal actin bundles in strains with alterations in expression of the fascin and / or forked proteins . Thus , synthetic phenotypes of actin cross - linking proteins are not necessarily evidence of complete redundancy and identical function . Additional investigations could potentially reveal distinct contributions to cell structure and function which are likely required for conservation of these proteins across extended evolutionary distances . Future studies of the unique and redundant roles of the multiple actin cross - linking proteins will be aided by generation of different single and multiple mutant strains , as well as by development and / or utilization of quantitative assays for other speciﬁc aspects of cell function .
