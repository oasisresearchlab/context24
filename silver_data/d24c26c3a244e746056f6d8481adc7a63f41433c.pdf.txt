It is largely unknown how these 27 differences are generated during naïve - to - primed transition process . We have 28 established a robust in vitro transition system using a Wnt inhibitor for the first time 29 and analyzed dynamic changes in cellular status via single - cell RNA - sequencing and 30 C1 CAGE analyses . 31 Results : Analysis of known marker genes suggested that the cell transition process 32 progresses as expected . However , cluster analyses revealed a sudden increase in 33 expression profile diversities three and four days after induction of the transition . These 34 expression diversities can be reconciled by the presence of two subpopulations with 35 distinct transcription profiles emerging at these time points . One of the subpopulations 36 appears transiently , and surprisingly these cells showed a global downregulation of 37 gene expression . Moreover , initiation of random X chromosome inactivation ( XCI ) 38 coincides with the appearance of these transient cells . The other subpopulation can 39 be maintained as a stem cell line and possesses expression profiles more similar to 40 those of primed epiblast stem cells ( EpiSC ) than embryonic stem cells ( ESC ) . 41 However , there are important differences in gene expression related to epithelial - 42 mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , suggesting that this subpopulation may represent a 43 novel pluripotent state that has an intermediate cellular phenotype between ESC and 44 EpiSC . 45 Conclusions : These findings should contribute to our understanding of the 46 establishment and maintenance of distinct differentiation statuses of mammalian PSCs 47 and provide new insights into the pluripotency spectrum in general . 48 49 243 words ( Max 250 words ) 50 51 Keywords 52 Single cell transcriptomics , Pluripotent stem cells , Cell differentiation , Naïve 53 pluripotency , Primed pluripotency , Developmental transition , enhancer RNA , non - 54 coding RNA , X chromosome inactivation 55 56 3 Introduction 57 58 Pluripotency of cells becomes restricted during development . Cells are undergoing 59 differentiation and acquire distinct functions required for each cell type and cell lineage . 60 In mammals , there exists cell lineage maintaining pluripotency in the early stage of 61 development , and cultured stem cell lines which can be propagated indefinitely in vitro 62 while retaining pluripotency have been derived from these pluripotent cells . Currently , 63 at least two types of PSCs are known in mammals , i . e . naïve and primed . Mouse ESCs 64 correspond to naïve PSCs , while mouse EpiSCs , human ESCs and human induced 65 pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) are classified as primed PSCs . The mouse ESCs are 66 derived from preimplantation blastocysts , while EpiSCs are derivative of epiblast cells 67 of mouse postimplantation embryos . Naïve and primed PSCs , both have capacities to 68 differentiate into multiple cell types from the three germ layers , although they are 69 different in various aspects . For example , there are differences between mouse ESCs 70 and EpiSCs in their epigenetic status , e . g . DNA methylation [ 1 ] , enhancer usage [ 2 , 71 3 ] , expression of naïve pluripotent markers [ 4 ] , cell adhesion properties [ 5 ] , nuclear 72 architecture / replication timing [ 6 ] , and metabolism [ 7 ] . Furthermore , in female cells X 73 chromosome inactivation ( XCI ) takes place in EpiSCs , whereas mESCs show no XCI 74 [ 8 ] . These differences were revealed by comparisons between mouse ESCs and 75 EpiSCs , but it is still largely unknown how these differences are generated during the 76 transition process from naïve to primed status or how cells exit from the naïve state to 77 gain primed pluripotency . On the other hand , it has been suggested that mammalian 78 PSCs may have greater diversities than previously thought [ 9 ; 10 ] . For example , it was 79 reported that EpiSC - like cells may be present in the mES cell population or vice versa 80 [ 11 , 12 ] . Recently , " formative state” , a hypothetical state representing the intermediate 81 state between naïve and primed states has been proposed [ 13 , 14 ] . However , such 82 an intermediate state between naïve and primed has previously not been clearly 83 defined . This is probably due to the lack of an experimental model system that 84 recapitulates the naïve - to - primed transition reproducibly in vitro . Mouse ESCs can be 85 converted to primed PSCs by changing the culture medium , but massive cell death 86 occurs , which hampers a precise analysis of the transition process [ 15 , 16 ] . Epiblast - 87 like cells ( EpiLC ) possess cellular characteristics similar to the primed EpiSCs , but 88 4 these cells appear only transiently after induction from mESCs and cannot be 89 maintained as a stem cell line [ 17 ] . We recently reported a robust method to efficiently 90 establish EpiSC cell lines by using an Wnt inhibitor [ 18 ] . Using a modified culture 91 condition with the Wnt inhibitor we succeeded to establish an in vitro system , in which 92 we could efficiently and reproducibly convert ESC to primed PSC - like cells for the first 93 time . The primed PSC - like cells generated in this way show cellular morphologies 94 highly similar to those of the existing EpiSC lines and can be maintained in vitro for at 95 least 20 passages ( this work ) without losing the primed PSC characteristics . As a 96 preliminary experiment , we have converted mES cells carrying a fluorescence reporter 97 specific to the naïve state and found that the transition process proceeds 98 asynchronously , and that cells with distinct cellular states were intermingled within a 99 colony . Therefore , we applied two methods of single - cell RNA sequencing ; as the 100 Fluidigm single - cell RNA - Seq ( scRNA - Seq ) [ 19 ] and single - cell C1 Cap Analysis of 101 Gene Expression ( C1 CAGE ) [ 20 ] to elucidate dynamic changes in cellular status 102 during the naïve - to - primed transition process at single - cell resolution for the first time . 103 CAGE detects 5’ - end of coding mRNA as well as non - coding RNA including enhancer 104 or antisense RNAs [ 21 ] . Thus , this technique may provide insights into the 105 enhancer / promoter interplay or non - coding RNA functions , which drives hierarchical 106 regulations of gene expression during development . 107 Single - cell transcriptome data revealed distinct cell clusters in addition to the 108 clusters mainly composed of ESCs or EpiSCs . The temporal order of emergence of 109 these intermediary clusters was estimated by pseudotime analysis . Surprisingly , 110 thousands of genes are globally downregulated in one of the intermediary clusters . 111 Moreover , initiation of XCI coincides with the appearance of this cell cluster . The other 112 subpopulation represents self - renewing stem cells exhibiting distinct expression 113 profiles from the EpiSC cells , suggesting that this subpopulation may represent novel 114 stem cells that have an intermediate cellular phenotype between mESC and EpiSC . 115 These findings should contribute to our understanding of the establishment and 116 maintenance of distinct differentiation statuses of mammalian PSCs and provide new 117 insights into the pluripotency spectrum in general . 118 119 120 5 Materials and Methods 121 122 Cell line 123 ESCs used in this study were established from female F1 inter - subspecific hybrid 124 embryos ( MB3 ) , a cross between C57BL / 6J ( B6 ) and MSM / Ms ( MSM ) ( RIKEN RBC 125 No . RBRC00209 ) . MSM is an inbred mouse strain derived from the Japanese wild 126 mouse Mus musculus molossinus . We also used female EpiSCs , 129Ba2 , a 129xB6N 127 F1 hybrid line [ 18 ] . In addition , we sampled the primed PSC - like cells at Day 22 ( P10 ) 128 and a clonal cell line isolated from the primed PSC - like cells sampled at passage 20 129 ( Clone 1E ) . All animal experiments were approved by the Institution Animal 130 Experiment Committee of RIKEN Tsukuba Institute . 131 132 ES cell culture 133 Mouse ESCs were cultured in ES medium composed of Glasgow - Minimal Essential 134 Medium ( GMEM ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) supplemented with 14 % knockout serum 135 replacement ( KSR ) ( Life Technologies ) , 1 % ES culture grade fetal calf serum ( FCS ) 136 ( Life Technologies ) , 1x non - essential amino acid ( NEAA ) ( Life Technologies ) , 1000 137 units / mL LIF , 100 µM 2 - mercaptoethanol and penicillin / streptomycin . Mouse ESCs 138 were maintained on mitomycin C ( Sigma - Aldrich ) treated mouse embryonic fibroblast 139 ( MEF ) feeder cells [ 22 ] . 140 141 Naïve - to - primed conversion 142 Mouse ESCs were seeded onto MEF feeders at a density of 1 - 3 x 10 5 cells per 3 cm 143 dish and cultured in the ES medium over night at 37°C . For conversion of ES cells to 144 EpiSC - like cells , ES cell medium was replaced with EpiSC medium ( DMEM / F12 plus 145 glutamax ( Gibco ) , 1xNEAA ( Life Technologies ) , 15 % KSR ( Life Technologies ) , 5 146 ng / mL of basic FGF ( Reprocell ) , 10 ng / mL of Activin A ( Wako ) and 2 µM IWP - 2 147 ( Stemgent ) and the cells were incubated at 37°C overnight . The day of the medium 148 change was set as Day 0 . On the next day ( Day 1 ) , cells were passaged using CTKCa 149 dissociation buffer ( phosphate buffered saline containing 0 . 25 % trypsin ( BD Diagnostic 150 Systems ) , 1 mg / ml of collagenase ( Life Technologies ) , 20 % KSR ( Life Technologies ) , 151 1 mM CaCl 2 ) essentially as described by Sugimoto et al . [ 18 ] . The medium was 152 6 changed every day and cells were passaged every other day . For harvesting primed 153 PSC - like cells , cells were dissociated by 0 . 25 % Trypsin , 1 mM EDTA and the single 154 cell suspension was used for single - cell capture or plate purification was done to 155 remove feeder cells before harvesting . 156 157 Single - cell capture , RT and cDNA synthesis 158 For each sample 3 , 000 cells were loaded in a C1 single - cell Auto Prep array ( Fluidigm , 159 100 - 5760 ) for mRNA - sequencing ( 10 – 17 μm ) . We processed samples of all time 160 points following the Fluidigm manufacturer’s instructions and recommended reagents 161 ( PN 100 - 7168 l1 ) as well as the C1 CAGE protocol 162 ( https : / / www . fluidigm . com / c1openapp / scripthub / script / 2015 - 07 / c1 - cage - 163 1436761405138 - 3 ) [ 23 ] . After priming the C1 array and loading of the cell mix we 164 added a Calcein AM / Ethidium homodimer - 1 staining mix ( LIVE / DEAD kit , Life 165 Technologies ) . Both protocols follow the manufacturer guide to perform the cell mix 166 loading , staining , loading of reagent mixes for lysis , reverse transcription , PCR 167 amplification and cDNA harvest . We used External RNA Controls Consortium ( ERCC ) 168 spike Mix 1 ( Thermo Fisher , 4456740 ) [ 24 ] instead of ArrayControl RNA spikes . 169 170 Single - cell capture imaging 171 Imaging of the cell capture chambers was done in brightfield , green filter and red filter 172 mode . Due to the different sample acquisition time points for both Fluidigm scRNA - 173 Seq protocol and C1 CAGE two different imaging systems have been used . The first 174 device was Cellomics ArrayScan VTI High Content Analysis Reader ( Thermo 175 Scientific ) and it was applied as described elsewhere [ 25 ] . The main difference 176 between the Cellomics platform and the follow up IN Cell Analyzer 6000 system ( GE 177 Healthcare ) is the eased use in automated C1 array scans and the capability of the IN 178 Cell Analyzer to take z - stacked images , which show a vertical cross section of the 179 capture chamber . All images from the two platforms are available from SCPortalen at 180 ( http : / / single - cell . clst . riken . jp / riken _ data / mES2EpiSC _ summary _ view . php ) [ 26 ] 181 182 Library preparation and sequencing 183 The optimal concentration range for harvested single - cell cDNA is between 0 . 1 to 0 . 3 184 7 ng / µL . In case of the Fluidigm scRNA - Seq protocol 2 µL of each cell have been diluted 185 in appropriate amounts of harvest dilution buffer based on prior picogreen ( Thermo 186 Fisher , P11496 ) cDNA concentration measurements for each cDNA cell sample . The 187 workflow for the library preparation equally follows the Fluidigm manufacturer 188 instructions and used reagents from Illumina ( FC - 131 - 1096 , FC - 131 - 1002 ) . In brief , 189 after cDNA sample dilution comes the tagmentation reaction , followed by an enzyme 190 deactivation step and finally an indexing PCR for multiplexing samples . Fluidigm 191 scRNA - Seq utilizes the Nextera XT index primer kit with 96 indices , whereas C1 CAGE 192 uses a custom primer set [ 20 ] ( Invitrogen ) instead of the kit’s S index primer set . All 193 samples are pooled after the index PCR and the pooled mix is purified using Agencourt 194 AMPure XP magnetic beads as described in the Fluidigm manual . Prior to sequencing 195 on Illumina HiSeq2500 we quantified all libraries ( KAPA Library Quantification kit , 196 KK4835 ) and adjusted the library concentration for loading on the flow cell to 9 pM . 197 Library quality has been checked with Agilent High Sensitivity DNA kit ( 5067 - 4626 ) 198 prior to loading on the flow cell . Fluidigm scRNA - Seq protocol samples were 199 sequenced in high - output mode , paired end , 100 bases and C1 CAGE in high output 200 mode , paired end , 50 bases . 201 202 Fluidigm scRNA - Seq data processing 203 All FASTQ files from Fluidigm scRNA - Seq runs where mapped using STAR v2 . 4 . 1d 204 [ 27 ] against the GRCm38p4 reference genome and Gencode M8 as annotation 205 reference . The mapping output was used for upload to ZENBU . We used Tagdust 206 v2 . 13 [ 28 ] to remove library primer and adapter sequence artifacts , rRNA sequences , 207 Spike sequences , and other non - desirable sequences before RNA - seq quantification . 208 Estimates of RNA expression were generated with Kallisto v0 . 44 . 0 [ 29 , 30 ] using 209 Gencode M8 transcript IDs as reference . We combined the resulting single - cell 210 expression matrices into two comprehensive matrices with single cells in columns and 211 rows with gene level expression values as estimated counts and TPM values 212 respectively . 213 214 C1 CAGE sequence data processing 215 Two different C1 CAGE data processing workflows have been applied . For the first , 216 8 C1 CAGE FASTQ files have been processed using the Moirai software platform [ 31 ] 217 ( https : / / github . com / Population - Transcriptomics / C1 CAGE - preview / blob / master / OP - 218 WORKFLOW - CAGEscan - short - reads - v2 . 0 . ipynb ) . The Moirai pipeline creates BED12 219 files for all C1 CAGE samples , which are used to make a CAGEexp object with the 220 CAGEr R Bioconductor package [ 32 ] ( https : / / rdrr . io / bioc / CAGEr / ) . We made a custom 221 BED file for annotating expressed TSS in order to make a C1 CAGE gene expression 222 matrix . The annotation BED file from refTSS [ 33 ] combines annotations from 223 DRA000914 [ 34 ] , the FANTOM5 mouse promotor and enhancer atlas 224 ( https : / / fantom . gsc . riken . jp / data / ) and the Eukaryotic Promotor Database EPDnew 225 mouse promotors ( https : / / epd . vital - it . ch / EPDnew _ database . php ) , as well as Gencode 226 M8 . The gene expression matrix was generated with the CAGEr function 227 CTSStoGenes . The resulting expression matrix was used to perform DEG analysis 228 and k - means clustering analog to how it was done on Fluidigm scRNA - Seq data . This 229 was done for direct comparison of Fluidigm scRNA - Seq and C1 CAGE data ( Figure 230 1D , S2A , 4A ) 231 232 Expression data analysis 233 All expression data analysis was done on the respective gene expression matrices for 234 Fluidigm scRNA - Seq and C1 CAGE after removing cells that fail quality controls and 235 have been tagged for removal in the affiliated experimental metadata tables . Quality 236 was assessed from various sources such as capture images , cDNA concentration or 237 sequencing reads . Based on t - Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding ( t - SNE ) k - 238 means clusters we performed differential gene expression analysis between all 239 clusters using the SCDE v2 . 10 . 1 R package [ 35 ] . Pseudotime analysis was done with 240 TSCAN v1 . 20 . 0 [ 36 ] using the set of differentially expressed genes between the Day 241 0 cells and the EpiSC cells and the differentially expressed genes between t - SNE k - 242 means cluster 1 and 5 in case of pseudotime sorting of C1 CAGE samples . 243 Hierarchical clustering heatmaps have been created with the pheatmap v1 . 0 . 12 R 244 package [ 37 ] . Gene ontology analysis was done with the Enrichr web tool [ 38 , 39 ] . Cell 245 cycle assignment was done using a set of orthologous mouse genes based on the set 246 from Whitfield et al . [ 40 ] with the phase scoring method described in [ 41 ] . All sample 247 BAM files of the STAR alignment output and C1 CAGE BED12 files have been 248 9 uploaded to the ZENBU browser for expression visualization and data exploration [ 42 ] 249 ( Figure S1J ) . 250 251 Promotor / enhancer analysis 252 A promotor / enhancer expression matrix was constructed intersecting read 5’ ends 253 with FANTOM5 promotor / enhancer annotation using a second C1 CAGE data 254 processing workflow ( https : / / fantom . gsc . riken . jp / data / ) . The data were processed 255 using Seurat [ 43 ] v3 . 1 . 1 , excluding features detected in fewer than 3 cells and cells 256 tagged for removal in metadata , and normalized with Seurat NormalizeData 257 ( normalization . method = " LogNormalize " , scale . factor = 10000 ) . Differential 258 expression testing was performed with Seurat FindAllMarkers ( min . pct = 0 . 05 , 259 logfc . threshold = 0 . 25 , using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test ) . Pseudotime analysis was 260 performed with Slingshot v1 . 4 . 0 , tradeSeq v1 . 1 . 03 and clusterExperiment v2 . 6 . 1 : 261 PCA1 - 30 of the top 10000 promotors / enhancers were clustered using Seurat 262 FindClusters ( algorithm = 4 ( Leiden ) , resolution = 0 . 7 ) . Pseudotime curve was 263 generated with Slingshot getLineages using the previous PCA embeddings specifying 264 the start and end cluster . NB - GAM model fit with Slingshot fitGAM ( nknots = 7 ) to the 265 top 20 % of features by variance across cells ( 4334 promotors and 341 enhancers ) . 266 Consensus clustering of the expression patterns was performed with tradeSeq 267 clusterExpressionPatterns ( minSizes = 50 ) and merged with 268 mergeClusters ( mergeMethod = " adjP " , DEMethod = " limma " , cutoff = 0 . 95 ) from into 5 269 enhancer / promotor clusters . 270 271 RNA - FISH and immunostaining 272 RNA - FISH analysis of Xist RNA using strand - specific DNA probe and 273 immunofluorescence analysis of H3K27me3 histone modifications were performed as 274 described in Shiura and Abe [ 44 ] . 275 276 Allelic expression preprocessing 277 The single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) data for MSM / Ms was downloaded 278 from NIG Mouse Genome Database ( MSMv4HQ , 279 http : / / molossinus . lab . nig . ac . jp / msmdb / index . jsp ) . We used X chromosome SNPs of 280 10 the coding region and filtered out multi allelic SNPs . The information about indels 281 was also filtered out . The SNPs lifted over from the mm10 genome to the mm9 282 genome with CrossMap - 0 . 2 . 6 [ 45 ] . MSM / Ms mouse genome was reconstructed from 283 mm9 using the SNPs with bigBedToBed 284 ( http : / / hgdownload . soe . ucsc . edu / admin / exe / macOSX . x86 _ 64 / ) and SeqKit v0 . 7 . 0 285 [ 46 ] . 286 287 Allelic expression analysis 288 For allelic expression analysis , we aligned all reads to both B6 mouse genome 289 ( mm9 ) and MSM / Ms mouse genome independently using STAR - 2 . 5 . 3a . We sorted 290 and merged reads from both B6 and MSM using SAMtools version 1 . 5 [ 47 ] . Variant 291 calling was performed using the Genome Analysis Toolkit ( GATK ) version 3 . 7 - 0 - 292 gcfedb67 [ 48 ] . Variant annotation was performed using SnpEff [ 49 ] / SnpSift [ 50 ] 4 . 3r 293 ( build 2017 - 09 - 06 16 : 41 ) . To identify high - confidence SNPs , we considered only 294 heterozygous bases present in dbSNP ( build 128 ) and MSMv4HQ reference 295 database . SNPs detected from B6 and MSM genome were collected . 296 The samtools mpileup command ( pileup2base _ no _ strand . pl , 297 https : / / github . com / riverlee / pileup2base ) was used to count the reads at each SNPs 298 genomic position from the merged reads from both B6 and MSM . 299 We classified the reads with SNPs as biallelic , B6 monoallelic or MSM 300 monoallelic . Allelic expression was measured as the total number of reads mapped 301 on the B6 genome divided by the total number of reads for each SNP : Allelic - 302 percentage = ( B6 reads / ( B6 + MSM ) reads ) * 100 [ % ] . 303 304 biallelic : allelic - percentage ≧ 10 or ≦ 90 [ % ] 305 B6 monoallelic : allelic - percentage > 90 [ % ] 306 MSM monoallelic : allelic - percentage < 10 [ % ] 307 Not detected : The reads were less than 10 308 309 We used two criteria to define the XCI state of each cell : one is biallelic expression 310 ratio and the other is B6 and MSM monoallelic expression ratio . In clone 1E cells , 311 11 which are supposed to complete XCI , the biallelic expression ratio of each cell was 312 found to be 11 % or less . Therefore , cells with a biallelic ratio of 11 % or less are defined 313 as ' XCI ' , while the rest of the cells are defined as ' XC _ Active ' . We also used the MSM 314 and B6 monoallelic expression ratio for defining XCI state . The clone 1E cells , in which 315 B6 chromosome X is inactivated , showed MSM monoallelic expression ratio of ≧ 72 % . 316 Thus , we defined the cells with B6 or MSM monoallelic expression ratio of more than 317 72 % as cells undergone rXCI . When both criteria were fulfilled , a cell was defined as 318 either ' XCI ' or ' XCI _ active ' . If the two criteria are not fulfilled , a cell was classified as 319 ' XCI _ Intermediate ' . Cells with less than 50 variants were labeled as ' No _ definition ' . 320 321 322 12 Results 323 324 Transition from naïve to primed pluripotency 325 Naïve state to primed state transition was initiated by replacing ES cell culture medium 326 with EpiSC medium containing an Wnt inhibitor , IWP - 2 , and the day of the medium 327 change was set as Day 0 . Cells at Day 0 showed typical morphologies of naïve ESCs , 328 i . e . round and dome - shaped compact colonies ( Figure S1A ) . These dome - shaped 329 colonies were observed until Day 2 ( Figure S1B , C ) but larger and flatter colonies 330 appeared from Day 3 on ( Figure S1D , E ) . Morphologies of these flat colonies are 331 similar to those of EpiSCs directly derived from post - implantation embryos ( Figure 332 S1F ) , indicating that primed PSC - like cells appear to form after Day 3 . These primed 333 PSC - like cells can be propagated stably for more than 12 passages ( ~ 22 days after 334 the initiation of transition ) . From the primed PSC - like cells , clonal cell lines can be 335 obtained . Those clones were also morphologically stable even after 20 passages . 336 Addition of IWP - 2 to the medium is highly effective for transition to primed type stem 337 cells . Cells cultured in the medium containing IWP - 2 were converted efficiently to the 338 primed type cells , whereas high mortality was observed in cell culture without the Wnt 339 inhibitor ( Figure S1G , H ) . In this study , we used a female ES cell line derived from 340 intersubspecific hybrid embryos , which can be used for XCI analysis . Taking 341 advantage of numerous SNPs existing between the two subspecies , it is possible to 342 perform allele - specific gene expression analysis . We also used a female EpiSC line 343 as a reference primed PSCs [ 18 ] . In addition , we sampled the primed PSC - like cells 344 at Day 22 ( P10 ) and a clonal cell line isolated from the primed PSC - like cells ( Clone 345 1E ) , which underwent > 20 passages . 346 347 Single cell transcriptome analyses of the transition process using 348 scRNA - Seq and C1 CAGE 349 We used scRNA - Seq on a time - course of pluripotent mESCs triggered to undergo the 350 transition from a naïve to primed pluripotent state . In total we obtained 579 single cell 351 transcriptome profiles via the Fluidigm scRNA - Seq protocol and 587 cells via C1 352 CAGE ( Figure 1A ) . These cells passed stringent quality screenings before applying 353 computational analysis and represent sampling time points from a transition stage 354 13 between these two pluripotent states . They have been deeply sequenced with average 355 3 . 1 million sequencing reads per cell for scRNA - Seq and 1 million reads for C1 CAGE 356 respectively . 357 We observed a reduction of the median number of expressed genes within each 358 group of time points after Day 2 from more than 8500 expressed genes to less than 359 8000 genes ( Figure 1B ) . Furthermore , the variability of expressed genes in individual 360 cells was larger in cells from the Day 3 , Day 4 and EpiSC group compared to earlier 361 time points . Plotting the Spearman correlation of nearest cells [ 51 ] also shows a more 362 variable distribution for the same groups ( Figure 1C ) , thus indicating a global change 363 in cellular expression profiles during the transition process from naïve to primed stem 364 cells . 365 We also checked known marker genes of the naïve state ( shown here Esrrb , 366 Nr0b1 , Dppa4 , Zfp42 ) , pluripotency markers ( Pou5f1 , Sox2 ) and primed state markers 367 ( Sox4 , Cd24a , Dnmt3b ) and could validate our data by matching the expression of 368 these known markers with our time point samples ( Figure 1D ) . 369 We performed differential gene expression analysis between the cells from the 370 Day 0 mES group and the EpiSC group . This resulted in 950 significantly differentially 371 expressed ( DE ) genes ( p adjust < 0 . 01 ) between these groups ( File S2 ) which allowed 372 us to visualize our data via hierarchical cluster analysis ( Figure 2A ) . Many genes 373 appear to be specifically downregulated in the cluster 3 group ( Figure 2A , Figure S7G , 374 Figure S14A and S14B , File S3 ) . Principal component analysis ( PCA ) demonstrates 375 that PC1 and PC2 separate the cells depending on their developmental progression 376 from naïve to primed ( Figure 2B ) . The Day 0 to Day 2 samples form a dense cluster 377 of cells , whereas after Day 2 cells start to show larger expression heterogeneity and 378 thus distribute more widespread in the PCA plot . This observation is consistent with 379 the wider distribution seen in Figure 1B and C . EpiSC cells are clustered together on 380 the opposite side of the naïve cells , i . e . Day 0 ( Figure 2B ) , and the Day 3 and Day 4 381 samples are mapped in between Day 0 and EpiSC , indicating that these cells are in 382 transition states . Next , we used t - SNE based on the same set of differentially 383 expressed genes and applied a k - means clustering with 5 clusters to organize our cells 384 into comparable groups ( Figure 2C and 2D , Figure S4A ) . These cluster results were 385 obtained after removing a group of 37 cells that formed a distinct sixth cluster via t - 386 14 SNE ( Figure S2A ) . These cells were found to be contaminating feeder cells due to 387 their expression of Y chromosome genes and the expression of the fibroblast marker 388 Vimentin as well as their lack of Pou5f1 expression ( Figure S2B - F ) . 389 In order to rule out confounding effects contributed due to the cell cycle phase 390 of cells we performed a cell cycle phase assignment based on the expression of known 391 phase marker genes [ 43 ; 52 ] . The cell cycle distribution among the cells ( Figure S3A 392 and S3B ) indicates that cell cycle did not contribute to the results obtained through 393 pseudotime analysis . 394 We also used pseudotime analysis to determine the temporal order of cell 395 samples from transitioning time points and overlaid the t - SNE plot with the pseudotime 396 order of cells ( Figure 2E , Figure S4B ) . This pseudotime sorting enabled us to 397 determine the developmental trajectory of samples within the five k - means cluster 398 groups . The pseudotime order reflects the actual time points of cell sampling and 399 serves as a validation of temporal developmental order purely based on cellular gene 400 expression profiles ( Figure 2F ) . 401 Following the trajectory indicated by the pseudotime sorting , the developmental 402 order of the clusters is 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 . Cluster 1 is mainly composed of Day 0 and 403 Day 1 cells , representing mostly naïve pluripotent cells . The Day 2 cells are contained 404 in both cluster 1 and cluster 2 , indicating that the Day 2 cells are heterogenous and a 405 fraction of the cells start transitioning their pluripotency state . Part of cluster 2 is 406 composed of Day 3 and Day 4 cells . All the cells belonging to cluster 5 correspond to 407 EpiSCs . Surprisingly , we found two intermediary clusters ( 3 and 4 ) between the naïve 408 and the primed state . Cluster 3 contains mainly Day 3 and 4 cells , while cluster 4 409 includes Day 3 and 4 as well as the primed PSC - like cells which have gone through 410 10 ~ 20 more passages compared to Day 3 and 4 cells , i . e . P10 and Clone 1E ( Figure 411 2C and 2D ) . It should be noted that morphologies of P10 and Clone 1E cells are highly 412 similar to those of EpiSCs , but the cluster 4 clearly demonstrates distinct expression 413 profiles from those of cluster 5 according to the t - SNE results . 414 415 Characterization of t - SNE clusters based on single cell gene expression profiles 416 After grouping cells into five clusters , we performed differential gene expression 417 analysis between the clusters ( File S2 ) . As shown in Figure 3A , there is a large 418 15 increase in the number of significant DE genes between cluster 2 and 3 , as well as 3 419 and 4 , suggesting that cluster 3 exhibits distinct expression profiles compared to other 420 clusters . Expression of each DE gene can be visualized at single - cell resolution by 421 overlaying single - cell expression levels onto the t - SNE map ( Figure 3B , Figure S5 ) . By 422 manually examining such visualizations for 1044 selected DE genes , we identified 423 genes specific to each cluster , as well as genes enriched in multiple clusters , or absent 424 from all but one cluster . Based on these DE genes expression patterns , we can outline 425 characteristics of each cluster . 426 Cluster 1 is enriched with naïve pluripotency genes such as Esrrb or Zfp42 . 427 Expression of these genes is also detected in cluster 2 , thus they are not very specific 428 to cluster 1 . There are some genes highly enriched in cluster 1 , e . g . Nlrp4f and 429 Arl14epl , whose expressions are detected predominantly in oocytes and 430 preimplantation embryos [ 53 ] . 431 Most of the DE genes in cluster 2 are expressed in other clusters as well . Many 432 naïve pluripotency genes are heterogeneously expressed in this cluster and are 433 downregulated as cell differentiation progresses . There are some genes , e . g . 434 Tmem59l or Car4 , whose expression is initiated in cluster 2 on and continued to be 435 expressed until later stages , indicating naïve to primed conversion already 436 commenced from this cluster . There are only a few genes exhibiting cluster 2 - specific 437 expression , e . g . Wnt8a . 438 The intermediary cluster 3 is characterized by specific downregulation of 439 thousands of genes ; approximately one third of the transcriptome shows 440 downregulation in this cluster ( Figure 2A , Figure S14A and S14B , File S3 ) . Therefore , 441 there are many examples for genes specifically downregulated in cluster 3 such as 442 Tmem263 , Trp53 or Ccnb2 ( Figure S5 , File S4 ) . On the other hand , there is also a 443 group of genes exhibiting specific upregulation only in this cluster , e . g . H1fx , Itga7 , 444 Ccdc36 and Rpph1 . Along this line , it is interesting to find cluster 3 - specific expression 445 of Rn7sk , which is a small nuclear RNA known to act as a transcriptional regulator in 446 embryonic stem cells by decreasing the rate of RNA PolII elongation and inhibiting the 447 CDK9 / Cyclin T complex [ 54 , 55 ] . This observation can be an indicator that gene 448 regulatory networks are re - configured in this transient state in order to prepare cells 449 for later lineage commitment . Besides these genes unique to cluster 3 , the cells in 450 16 cluster 3 show residual expression of naïve pluripotency genes and initial expression 451 of primed marker genes same as cluster 2 cells . 452 In cluster 4 known primed marker genes are expressed , while naïve 453 pluripotency gene expression has been almost diminished , suggesting their primed 454 identity . In fact , known primed marker genes like Fgf5 or Pou3f1 are positives for 455 cluster 4 as well as cluster 5 , which is solely composed of EpiSCs . However , there are 456 several genes expressed in clusters 2 , 3 and 4 , but greatly reduced in cluster 5 . In 457 particular , the cell adhesion molecule E - cadherin ( Cdh1 ) is known to be expressed in 458 naïve type ESCs , but not in primed EpiSCs [ 56 ] . Cdh1 is clearly expressed in cluster 459 4 , while downregulated in cluster 5 . Other genes like Cyp24a1 or Krt18 demonstrate 460 cluster 4 specific expression as well , suggesting that cluster 4 cells have distinct 461 expression profiles compared to those of cluster 5 . 462 Cluster 5 is composed of only EpiSCs , therefore express primed PSC markers , 463 many of which are shared by cluster 4 cells . However , there are genes whose 464 expressions are specific to cluster 5 , but not to cluster 4 cells . For example , expression 465 of Cdh2 which encodes N - cadherin or Vim which encodes vimentin are detected only 466 in cluster 5 . Cdh2 and Vim are known to be involved in EMT , and the results suggest 467 that cluster 5 cells have completed EMT , whereas cluster 4 cells have not . This is 468 significant , because EMT is one of the hallmarks of naïve - to - primed transition [ 57 ] . In 469 other words , this finding indicates that cluster 4 cells have not completed EMT , 470 representing a novel , intermediate pluripotency state between naïve and primed 471 pluripotency . In addition , we manually identified 54 cluster 5 - specific genes ( File S4 ) ; 472 one of which is Cd59a representing a novel , highly specific EpiSC marker ( Figure 3B , 473 Figure S5 ) . 474 Based on the significant DE genes we performed gene set enrichment analysis 475 with the web - based Enrichr tool [ 39 , 40 ] . We identified DE genes enriched in KEGG 476 pathways ( Figure S6 ) . In the differences between cluster 1 and 2 we find genes linked 477 to pluripotency maintenance , whereas cluster 3 vs 4 show many DE genes belonging 478 to metabolic pathways and in the cluster 4 vs 5 differences we can see striking 479 changes in genes linked to cell adhesion molecules , which suggests that cell surface 480 properties of the cluster 4 and 5 are different . 481 482 17 C1 CAGE revealed dynamic changes in promoter / enhancer activities during the 483 transition process 484 Like the procedure used to cluster the Fluidigm scRNA - Seq derived data , we 485 generated a t - SNE plot for the C1 CAGE data using 635 genes differentially expressed 486 between Day 0 mES and EpiSC samples . Strikingly , we can independently validate 487 our cluster results from the Fluidigm scRNA - Seq protocol with the C1 CAGE data . 488 There are also two naïve k - means clusters ( 1 and 2 ) , two transition stage clusters 489 ( cluster 3 and 4 ) , as well as an EpiSC specific cluster ( 5 ) and a small cluster comprising 490 of feeder or differentiated cells ( 6 ) ( Figure 4A , S7G ) . Unlike the Fluidigm scRNA - Seq 491 protocol C1 CAGE allows the detection of both non - poly adenylated transcripts and 492 poly ( A ) + RNA . Cluster 7 in the heat map consists of 48 histone gene transcripts , most 493 of which show upregulated expression in the k - means cluster 4 and 5 ( Figure 4B , File 494 S3 ) . Such a histone cluster upregulation is not detected by the Fluidigm scRNA - Seq , 495 as they are mostly non - poly adenylated [ 58 ] . Due to the different priming strategies 496 and thus in RNA capture between these protocols , there is a larger variability with 497 regards to which expressed genes have been detected . Nevertheless , we could 498 observe that marker genes are expressed appropriately in the clusters ( Figure S7A - 499 F ) . According to the results , the k - means clusters 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 generated from the C1 500 CAGE data correspond to the clusters 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 of the scRNA - Seq analysis , 501 respectively ( Fig . 2D , Fig . 4A ) . 502 NASTs are a class of short , low abundance non - coding RNA expressed 503 specifically in naïve ESCs [ 34 ] . We found that a number of NAST genes are expressed 504 during the naïve - to - primed transition process , and some of them appear to be naïve 505 state - specific downregulated upon entering the primed state , e . g . heatmap row cluster 506 1 ( Figure S7G ) . We can also observe a decrease in expression of many NASTs during 507 the naïve to primed transition phase cluster 3 ( Figure S7G ) . It is not well studied to 508 what extent annotated NASTs may be part of annotated genes from other annotation 509 sources and thus to what degree individual NASTs are genuinely unique genes . 510 With the C1 CAGE data we could demonstrate dynamic changes in single - cell 511 promotor and enhancer usage during the naïve - to - primed conversion process ( Figure 512 4B , Figure S8A - B ) . There are enhancer RNAs ( eRNAs ) that show specificity for the 513 naïve state , the transition period , and the primed state ( Figure S8C ) . 514 18 In accordance with the findings from the scRNA - Seq data , C1 CAGE data also 515 shows that TSS level ( Transcription Start Site ) expression is reduced in cluster 3 516 ( Figure 4B ) . Figure S9A shows the promotors exhibiting great reduction of expression 517 only in the cluster 3 ( Figure S9A ) , while nine promotors show specific upregulation in 518 the cluster 3 ( Figure S9B ) . We also identified 10 non - coding eRNAs downregulated in 519 k - means cluster 3 and two eRNAs that are upregulated ( Figure S9C ) , suggesting that 520 the enhancer activities are also altered in the cluster 3 cells . Figure S10 shows the top 521 nine differentially expressed promotors and enhancers for each C1 CAGE k - means 522 cluster group . 523 We calculated pseudotimes for all cells based on TSS expression , using 524 Slingshot [ 58 ] for C1 CAGE pseudotime analysis . We divided the Slingshot 525 pseudotime scale into 10 bins . By comparing Slingshot pseudotime bins with k - means 526 clusters and sampling time points ( Figure S11A - C ) , we could show that the scRNA - 527 Seq k - means cluster 3 corresponds to the Slingshot pseudotime bin 6 or [ 19 . 9 - 528 23 . 8 ] ( Figure S11D ) . Here we identified 5 modules of promotors and enhancers with 529 similar expression patterns depicted along the Slingshot pseudotime bin ( Figure 4C , 530 Figure S12 ) . Modules 1 is active in the naïve state and the activities is decreased 531 progressively as differentiation proceeds . Module 2 is constant until the bin 6 and 532 declines thereafter . Other modules 3 , 4 and 5 also show changes in their activities at 533 around the bin 6 , suggesting it corresponds to the transition point . These expression 534 pattern modules of promotors and enhancers might correspond to gene regulatory 535 networks interactions involved in establishment and maintenance of pluripotency 536 states . 537 538 X chromosome inactivation initiated at Day 3 as revealed by RNA - FISH and 539 scRNA - Seq 540 As described before , the period between Day 2 and Day 3 corresponds to the transition 541 point , where cells exit from a naïve state to a more differentiated state . To support this 542 notion , we analyzed XCI status of cells , since XCI is one of the most reliable indicators 543 of cell differentiation [ 59 , 60 ] Random X chromosome inactivation ( rXCI ) is a 544 phenomenon in which one of the two X chromosomes is randomly inactivated in a 545 female mammalian cell during development [ 61 ] . It results in chromosome - wide 546 19 silencing of either the maternal or paternal X chromosome . Once established , the XCI 547 pattern of individual cells will be clonally inherited to the daughter cells . The large non - 548 coding RNA Xist is known to be involved in the initiation of XCI , leading to silencing of 549 most X - linked genes except for escapees , genes known to be exempted from XCI . XCI 550 is thought to occur as the cells exit from the naïve state , though precise timing of the 551 XCI initiation has not been determined [ 44 ] . Since we obtained global expression 552 profiles of single cells transitioning from naïve to primed , we reasoned that we could 553 delineate progression of the XCI process , taking advantage of our in vitro transition 554 system . 555 First , we conducted RNA - FISH analysis of Xist RNA expression ( Figure 5A ) . 556 The result indicates that Xist RNA clouds can increasingly be observed within nucleus 557 of each cell from Day 3 . Analysis of H3K27me3 deposits , another landmark of inactive 558 X , also showed the same trend ( Figure 5B ) . Next , we calculated and compared X 559 chromosome / autosome ( X / A ) expression ratios in each single cell ( Figure 5C ) . The 560 ratio is close to 2 at Day 0 , Day 1 and Day 2 , whereas it decreased to about 1 after 561 Day 3 . This indicates that total expression levels of the X - linked genes are reduced to 562 about half at Day 3 compared to Day 0 , Day 1 and Day 2 . These results suggest that 563 XCI initiates between Day 2 and Day 3 . 564 565 Allele - specific expression analysis of X - linked genes during the transition 566 process 567 To analyze allele specific gene expression , we developed a rXCI pipeline based on 568 the detected variants . We detected 1570 SNPs in the transcripts and focused on the 569 137 informative SNPs with reads > 10 expressed in at least 50 % of the cells . As shown 570 in Figure 6A , we colored allelic expression status for each gene ; blue for maternal 571 ( MSM strain ) allele , red for paternal ( B6 strain ) allele , green for biallelic expression and 572 gray for not detected . We observed a trend that biallelic expression of each X - linked 573 gene continues until Day 2 , while mono - allelic expression of X - linked genes appears 574 to increase from Day 3 onwards . At Day 4 , more than half of the cells underwent rXCI . 575 These findings demonstrate that rXCI begins at Day 3 , thus supporting the RNA - FISH 576 results . At Day 3 and Day 4 , there are cells still showing biallelic expression ( green ) , 577 but P10 cells which have undergone 12 passages show much less biallelic expression , 578 20 suggesting that rXCI may be completed in these cells . Analysis of the clone 1E sample 579 indicates that all the single cells derived from the same clone show the same allelic 580 expression pattern of the X - linked genes as expected ( Figure 6A ) . 581 582 Identification of known and novel escape genes 583 As just described , XCI is completed in P10 and clone 1E cells . However , several cells 584 showing biallelic expression were detected in these cells and we noticed that most of 585 the genes are known escape genes . Variants showing biallelic expression in at least 586 two cells from P10 and 1E clone were identified as escape genes , and among them 587 we found known escapees such as Ddx3x , Eif2s3x , Kdm5c , Kdm6a ( Figure S13A ) . 588 These results confirmed that our computational pipeline is appropriate for the analysis 589 of XCI status . We also identified some genes ( Slc7a3 , Hnrnpa1 or Cetn2 ) as potential 590 novel escapee candidates . Furthermore , regardless of the cell type or the 591 differentiation stage , genes expressed specifically from the B6 or MSM allele in almost 592 all the single cells were detected . These are also considered to be escape genes , but 593 their expressions are biased strongly to one of the two alleles . To validate our findings , 594 we performed Sanger sequencing of several candidate genes and confirmed that 595 Cetn2 , Slc7a3 and Hnrnpa1 are novel escape genes whose expression is biased to 596 one of the two alleles . 597 598 rXCI analysis and pseudotime estimation suggests that rXCI initiation coincides 599 with global downregulation of gene expression 600 Based on the bioinformatics analysis of the scRNA - Seq data , each cell was ordered 601 along the pseudotime axis to identify the starting time of rXCI on the pseudotime axis 602 ( Figure 6B ) . Surprisingly , we observed a transient downregulation of many X - linked 603 genes at a specific period during the transition . Such transient downregulations do not 604 seem to be X - linked gene specific . A heatmap visualization of 21 , 777 autosomal genes 605 shows that many of the genes are downregulated during this period ( Figure S14A ) , 606 while 965 X - linked genes show similar results ( Figure S14B ) . 607 During the downregulation period , it is not possible to assess XCI status . 608 However , cells undergone XCI begin to emerge after this downregulation period , 609 implying that cells might have to go through the downregulation period to attain XCI . 610 21 To visualize the XCI state of each single cell in a different way , we first 611 categorized the cells into four groups based on X chromosome states ; i . e . XCI , 612 XCI _ Intermediates , XC _ Active , No _ definition , according to the definition criteria 613 described in the method section . The assigned XCI status of each cell was overlaid 614 onto the t - SNE map ( Figure 6C ) . Almost all the cluster 1 and 2 cells are XC active . On 615 the other hand , all four categories of cells , especially considerable number of XCI cells , 616 were identified in the cluster 3 . It is interesting to find that Xist RNA expression is 617 upregulated in some of the cluster 3 cells , whereas Tsix , antisense partner of Xist with 618 repressive function on Xist expression , is being downregulated in the same cluster 619 ( Fig . S13B ) . There are more cells undergone XCI in the cluster 4 than in the cluster 3 , 620 while number of XCI _ Intermediate cells is similar to that of the XCI cells in the cluster 621 4 . In the cluster 4 , cells corresponded to P10 or clone 1E ( Figure 2C ) represent mainly 622 XCI cells , indicating that XCI is completed at later stages of the development . All the 623 above results indicate that cells in the cluster 3 just exited from the naïve state begin 624 to undergo XCI accompanied by a transient downregulation of gene expression not 625 just limited to the X - chromosome , and that XCI process is more advanced in the cluster 626 4 and almost completed in P10 and clone 1E cells . 627 628 629 22 Discussion 630 631 In this study , transcription dynamics of the naïve - to - primed transition process have 632 been explored for the first time by using two different single - cell transcriptomics 633 techniques , i . e . scRNA - Seq and C1 CAGE . The data obtained could thus generate a 634 comprehensive catalog of genes exhibiting characteristic changes during the 635 transition . Differential gene expression analysis identified known and novel marker 636 genes that should be extremely useful for functional characterization of this 637 developmental transition process . Interestingly , cluster analyses revealed 638 intermediary subpopulations of cells in addition to the naïve and the primed PSCs . The 639 presence of such subpopulations cannot be discovered by bulk expression analysis , 640 emphasizing the merits of the single - cell technologies . Here we used female ESCs 641 from intersubspecific hybrid embryos . Taking advantage of existing SNPs between the 642 two subspecies of mice [ 62 ] , we could perform allele - specific expression analysis at 643 the single - cell level and adopted this technique for the analysis of the random X 644 chromosome inactivation phenomenon . 645 646 Discovery of transient global downregulation of gene expression in the 647 transition stage 648 One of the most intriguing findings of this study is that approximately one third of the 649 transcriptome ( ~ 6000 genes ) is downregulated transiently and specifically in cells 650 classified as the cluster 3 ( Figures 2A , 4B , 6B ) . Both autosomal and X - linked genes 651 showed this transient gene repression . The cluster 3 cells exhibited expression profiles 652 highly divergent from those in cells of other identified clusters . This is probably due to 653 the global gene repression occurring in those cells . Heterogeneities and high variation 654 in expression profiles among cluster 3 cells may also be explained by different degrees 655 of gene repression at the time of sample collection . Such a subpopulation of cells , i . e . 656 cluster 3 , was detected reproducibly in three different batches ( two Day4 samples for 657 scRNA - Seq and one C1 CAGE Day4 ) of samples by using two different single - cell 658 technologies . Although the cluster 3 cells exhibited very distinct expression profiles , 659 pseudotime analysis estimated the cluster 3 emerged just after cells exited from the 660 naïve state . In fact , the cluster 3 cells express some of the naïve genes as well as 661 23 early markers for the primed state , suggesting that the cluster 3 cells position at an 662 intermediate step between naïve and primed . Cell cycle assignment analysis indicated 663 that the cluster 3 cells do not correspond to any specific cell cycle phase . There are 664 many genes specifically downregulated in cluster 3 , whereas those genes are highly 665 expressed in other clusters . On the other hand , there is a set of genes exhibiting 666 transient upregulation only in the cluster 3 , which may provide clues to the global gene 667 repression phenomenon in this cluster . One interesting example is Rn7sk , which 668 encodes a small non - coding RNA involved in transcription repression . Rn7sk is an 669 RNA component of a small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex ( snRNP ) and known to 670 inhibits the cyclin dependent kinase activity of the positive transcription elongation 671 factor P - TEFb [ 54 ] , acting as a gene - specific transcription repressor in ESCs [ 55 ] 672 Therefore , it is possible that Rn7sk may contribute to the global gene repression 673 occurring in the cluster 3 . Experimental tests of this hypothesis are currently underway . 674 675 The cluster 4 represents the third pluripotent stem cells with intermediate 676 characteristics between naïve and primed 677 The second unexpected finding in this study is the discovery of the cluster 4 ( Figure 678 2D ) . Cells in this cluster show morphologies similar to the primed PSCs and express 679 a number of the primed state marker genes . However , bioinformatical analysis 680 classified these cells to the cluster distinct from the EpiSC cluster , i . e . cluster 5 , and 681 the pathway analysis suggested that genes involved in cell adhesion are expressed 682 differentially between the cluster 4 and 5 . We noticed that the cluster 4 cells express 683 Cdh1 ( E - cadherin ) but do not express Cdh2 ( N - cadherin ) ( Figure S5 ) . It is known that 684 naïve PSCs undergo epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) process , in which Cdh1 685 expression of the naïve PSCs is replaced with Cdh2 expression that is specific to the 686 primed PSCs [ 64 ] . The absence of Cdh2 expression in the cluster 4 cells suggests that 687 the EMT may not be complete in these cells . Absence of vimentin expression in the 688 cluster 4 supports this notion ( Figure S2 , S5 ) . Since the completion of EMT is one of 689 the criteria defining the EpiSCs , the cluster 4 cells stay at the stage prior to the EpiSC 690 state and self - renew this cellular state . In other words , the cluster 4 cells may represent 691 novel pluripotent stem cells in mice besides ESCs and EpiSCs , exhibiting an 692 intermediate state between ESCs and EpiSCs . A third pluripotency state called 693 24 " formative " has previously been proposed [ 13 ] . The formative state is thought to be an 694 intermediate state between naïve and primed , although the formative PSCs have not 695 been established in mice . Whereas EpiLC [ 17 ] is suggested to be in the formative 696 state , it is a transient cell type and not self - renewing stem cell unlike our cluster 4 cells . 697 Our preliminary analysis suggests that EpiLC is more to the naïve state compared to 698 the cluster 4 cells . Although stem cells with intermediary pluripotency states had been 699 reported [ 65 , 66 ] , relationships of these cells with the formative state remain elusive . 700 Recently , it was reported that human naïve PSCs can acquire novel 701 pluripotency comparable to the formative state , if the naïve cells are cultured in 702 medium containing Wnt signaling inhibitor [ 14 ] . It is thus possible that our cluster 4 703 cells represent a mouse counter part of their formative state cells . Formative state 704 PSCs or PSCs cultured in the presence of Wnt inhibitor seem to have greater 705 capacities for multi - lineage differentiation compared to the existing naïve or primed 706 PSCs [ 18 , 67 , 68 ] and therefore those new versions of PSCs have a potential to 707 replace the naïve or primed PSCs in stem cell sciences . However , research on those 708 novel PSCs is still in its infancy and further studies must be conducted to elucidate its 709 full potential . Comparison of the putative formative - like PSCs between human and 710 mice should contribute to the understanding of this novel pluripotent state , and the 711 cluster 4 cells of this study provide a good reference for these comparisons . 712 713 Initiation of XCI coincides with emergence of the cluster 3 714 In our in vitro experimental system , random XCI happens between the time points Day 715 2 and Day 3 . This was confirmed by RNA - FISH , immunostaining and allele - specific 716 gene expression analysis at single cell resolution ( Figure 5A - B ) . Allele - specific 717 expression analysis enabled to classify each single cell arbitrarily into three categories , 718 i . e . biallelic , intermediate and inactivated . Detailed analysis of these three categories 719 of cells should yield important information about initiation and progression of this 720 epigenetic reprogramming event . Moreover , the analysis could detect known and 721 novel escaped genes as well as monoallelic expressed genes showing genetic - origin - 722 dependency . Combined , random XCI appears to be initiated in cells of the cluster 3 723 and more advanced in the cluster 4 cells . As described above , gene repression takes 724 place in the cluster 3 . Currently , we do not know whether this is just a coincidence or 725 25 indicative of mechanistic relationships between the two phenomena . Perturbation 726 experiments for either one of the phenomena could help to infer whether these two are 727 interdependent or not . There are precedents of the global gene repression : XCI in 728 mammalian female embryos , meiotic chromosome inactivation during male 729 spermatogenesis or global epigenomic changes in primordial germ cells [ 69 , 70 , 71 , 730 72 ] . Failures in these global repression phenomena lead to various abnormalities such 731 as embryonic lethality and infertility , clearly indicating the biological importance of the 732 global repression . Common feature of these phenomena is that they occur when cells 733 undergo major epigenetic reprogramming events . Therefore , the cluster 3 cells should 734 be analyzed with regards to epigenetic changes . In any case , our experimental system 735 should provide unprecedented opportunity for the studies of global gene repression 736 and epigenetic reprogramming . 737 738 C1 CAGE : a single cell transcriptome profiling beyond scRNA - Seq 739 In this study , we tried to use two different single cell expression profiling techniques 740 and compared the results . Basically , the results from the two methods are highly 741 consistent . In addition , as C1 CAGE can detect non - polyadenylated RNA , we were 742 able to observe expression dynamics of eRNAs , histone mRNAs and NASTs during 743 the transition process for the first time . Interestingly , some NASTs seem to show 744 specificity only to the naïve pluripotency states . Perturbation experiments on the 745 specific NASTs might help to shed light on the regulatory role of this class of non - 746 coding RNA in naïve states . It is known that usage of enhancers changes during the 747 naïve - primed transition [ 2 , 3 ] . For example , it is well known that Pou5f1 gene has both 748 distal and proximal enhancers , of which proximal enhancer drives the primed state - 749 specific expression [ 73 ] . In this particular case eRNA expression was not observed in 750 our analysis . This may be due to either very low level or no expression of eRNAs in 751 this locus , because even a bulk analysis using hundreds of cells conducted at the 752 same time as the C1 CAGE analysis could not detect CAGE counts in this region . 753 Thus , identification of enhancer should not rely on single parameter / technique alone . 754 Nevertheless , the present C1 CAGE analysis could detect novel RNA expression at a 755 number of enhancer regions annotated by FANTOM5 atlas , and some of which show 756 specificities to either naïve or primed state , confirming the previous notion [ 2 , 3 ] . 757 26 Therefore , we consider the C1 CAGE data of this study a valuable resource for further 758 studies on the regulatory roles of diverse classes of expressed non - coding RNAs 759 including eRNAs in the early mammalian developmental process . 760 761 27 References 762 763 1 .
