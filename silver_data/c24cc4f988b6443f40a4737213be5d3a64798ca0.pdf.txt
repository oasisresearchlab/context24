Here , we implemented the latest generation RNA imaging 30 system and combined it with microfluidics to visualize transcriptional regulation in living 31 Arabidopsis plants . This enabled quantitative measurements of the transcriptional activity of 32 single loci in single cells , real time and changing environmental conditions . Using phosphate 33 responsive genes as model , we found that active genes displayed high transcription initiation 34 rates ( ~ 3s ) and frequently clustered together in endoreplicated cells . We observed gene bursting 35 and large allelic differences in single cells , revealing that at steady - state , intrinsic noise 36 dominated extrinsic variations . Moreover , we established that transcriptional repression 37 triggered in roots by phosphate , a crucial macronutrient limiting plant development , occurred 38 with unexpected fast kinetics ( ~ minutes ) and striking heterogeneity between neighboring cells . 39 Access to single cell RNA polymerase II dynamics within live plants will benefit future studies 40 of signaling processes . 41 4 Introduction 42 Plants are sessile organisms permanently coping with environmental variations . Transcriptional 43 reprogramming 1 plays a key role in these responses as illustrated by the number of plant 44 transcription factors ( 5 . 4 % in Arabidopsis , https : / / agris - knowledgebase . org / ) . Most 45 physiological studies quantify mRNA abundance in organs . Accessing specific cell types is 46 possible by expressing a fluorescent marker in cells of interest , to FACS sort them and perform 47 sequencing analysis 2 . Nevertheless , this requires long enzymatic digestion to generate 48 protoplasts , preventing fast kinetic studies . Transcriptional fusions between promoters and 49 reporter genes such as GFP provide cellular resolution , but the time required to accumulate 50 detectable level of mature fluorophore ( often in the range of tens of minutes 3 ) prevents the 51 rapid transcriptional monitoring . This is moreover highly variable and depends on the strength 52 of the promoter studied and the microscopy setup , leading to confounding effects . These 53 considerations are even more crucial when studying transcriptional inhibition . The above - 54 mentioned experiments provide access to total RNA ( or protein ) , resulting from the balance 55 between synthesis and degradation . Many fluorescent proteins decay in the range of hours and 56 RNA degradation is highly variable from one gene to another 4 , 5 . For instance , the median half - 57 life value of Arabidopsis mRNAs is 107 min , but exceeds one day for many messengers 4 . This 58 is far too long for transcriptional responses occurring within seconds such as for instance during 59 light stress 6 . 60 All these issues can be resolved with a method originally developed for yeast and animal 61 granting direct real time access to transcriptional activity at the level of single cells 7 - 10 . It is 62 based on a fusion between GFP and the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein ( MCP - GFP ) 7 , 8 or on 63 related systems 11 . The MCP - GFP recognizes a specific RNA stem - loop inserted in multiple 64 copies into a reporter RNA , promoting MCP - GFP multimerization to provide signal bright 65 enough for single RNA visualization 9 . Importantly , binding occurs during RNA synthesis and 66 5 monitors transcription in real time . In plants , this technology would offer major advantages for 67 physiological studies such as adaptations to biotic and abiotic stresses . Indeed , it grants access 68 to the variability of all cell types providing ways to understand how the activity of single cells 69 is integrated within tissues or organs and thus to better understand gene regulation . Real time 70 quantitative analysis can be performed for transcription initiation , elongation or gene bursting . 71 This last phenomenon can further be used to identify promoter states that are rate - limiting for 72 transcription initiation , and thus likely points of regulation 12 . The MS2 technology also allows 73 the identification of extrinsic and intrinsic sources of transcriptional noise 74 Therefore , we implemented it into plants using state - of the art MS2x128 repeats to tag a single 75 RNA with ~ 250 to 500 GFPs for optimal detection sensitivity 13 . We used this system to analyze 76 the transcriptional response to a major macronutrient : inorganic phosphate ( Pi ) . Pi deficiency 77 triggers major transcriptional modifications affecting plant development and metabolism 14 , 15 . 78 These are mainly controlled by master regulator genes of the PHR1 family 15 - 17 . Being 79 constitutive , their regulatory activity relies on inhibitors of the SPX family tuned by Pi 80 uptake 18 , 19 as they inhibit PHR1 activity only in the presence of Pi metabolites 20 , 21 . 81 Here we used the promoter of early Pi responding genes to drive transcription of an 82 MS2x128 reporter . We combined fast quantitative imaging and microfluidics 22 , to precisely 83 control Pi delivery while providing stable environmental conditions . It revealed a high 84 heterogeneity of responses between adjacent cells and identified the rapid perception of Pi by 85 the root ( within 3 / 5 min ) validating the power of the MS2 technology to dissect plant 86 transcriptional regulation . 87 6 Results 88 Phosphate resupply promotes rapid transcriptional modifications 89 To identify early markers sensitive to phosphate , we starved plants and performed Pi refeeding 90 experiments . After addition of Pi in the liquid culture medium , we harvested roots and leaves 91 after 30 , 60 and 180 min for RNA - seq analysis . In roots , only 22 genes exhibited a significant 92 two - fold reduction of their transcript level over the three time points ( Fig . S1A - B ) . Analysis 93 of the shoot samples revealed a delayed reduction of all these markers in aerial parts ( only one 94 third were repressed after 30 min ) indicating that Pi was first perceived by roots . Independent 95 experiments analyzed by RTqPCR using well known markers for Pi starvation 15 , 23 , involved in 96 Pi uptake ( PHT1 ; 4 ) or Pi - induced metabolic remodelling ( SQD2 ) , confirmed these results ( Fig . 97 1A and S1B ) . The rapid down - regulation observed also highlighted the fast turn over of these 98 transcripts ( half - life estimated to 15 - 30 minutes ; Fig . S1A - B ) , in regard to the Arabidopsis 99 median value of 3 . 8 hours 5 . For the rest of this study we selected two genes ( SPX1 and 100 At5G20790 , named hereafter UNI1 for Unicorn1 ) , which combined the highest levels of 101 expression in Pi depleted medium ( - Pi ) with broad dynamics as measured by + Pi / - Pi fold 102 change . 103 Regulation was assumed to occur mainly transcriptionally , as the transcriptional 104 inhibitor cordycepin mimicked effect of Pi resupply ( Fig . 1A ) . This was confirmed by 105 transcriptional fusions with luciferase , which conferred to the reporter gene a similar temporal 106 response to Pi resupply ( Fig . S1C ) , whereas fusing a CaMV 35S constitutive promoter to the 107 coding region of the markers did not reveal any significant difference of RNA levels between 108 + Pi ( after 180 min refeeding ) or - Pi conditions ( Fig . S1D ) , except for short transient induction 109 promoted by the stress of Pi addition observed during first hour following resupply . A sequence 110 analysis of the 22 genes identified above revealed the presence of P1BS regulatory boxes 16 in 111 95 % of the cases . This box is the binding site of master regulators belonging to PHR1 / PHL1 112 7 family . Addition of Pi promotes synthesis of inositol pyrophosphates , which act as a molecular 113 tether to fix members of the SPX family to PHR1 and inhibit its activity 20 , 21 ( Fig . 1B ) . 114 Consistently , the induction of SPX1 and UNI1 during Pi starvation was nearly fully abolished 115 in phr1 / phl1 double mutants , which suppress a majority of PHR1 / PHL proteins ( Fig . 1C ) . 116 Moreover , this was observed for 91 % of the 22 genes identified ( Fig . S1A 17 ) . SPX family 117 members inhibit PHR1 and the analysis of spx1 / spx2 double mutants further revealed that 118 reducing the SPX protein pool delayed the repression triggered by Pi addition ( Fig . 1D ) . 119 Altogether , these results demonstrated that the fast decrease of the 22 transcripts identified here 120 resulted from transcriptional control involving several key players such as PHR or SPX family 121 of proteins . Of note , classical transcriptional fusion with Luciferase did not report a fast 122 transcriptional repression ( Fig . 1E ) . More than one hour was required to observe a significant 123 decrease of the signal , whereas RTqPCR failed to detect a significant reduction of mRNA levels 124 for at least 15 - 20 minutes after resupply ( data not shown ) . To better characterize the 125 transcriptional response to Pi resupply , we implemented the MS2 system for RNA labeling , a 126 technology so far restricted mostly to animal and yeast but offering unique spatio - temporal 127 resolution to study transcriptional regulation . 128 129 Generation and validation of MS2 - tagged Arabidopsis lines 130 131 We used the last generation MS2 tag containing 128xMS2 repeats , originally developped to 132 image single - molecule of HIV - 1 RNA 13 . To improve RNA folding and prevent plasmid 133 instability , this construct is made of 32 distinct MS2 stem loops replicated four times , with each 134 stem - loop binding dimers of the MCP protein with sub - nanomolar affinity 13 ( Fig . 2A ) . In 135 animal cells , this extended tag provides about a five - fold improved sensitivity over the original 136 MS2x24 tag and allows single molecule visualization for extended periods of times even at 137 high frame rates 13 . Moreover , this construct bears the lower affinity variant of the MS2 stem - 138 8 loops ( U instead of C in third position of the loop ) , providing excellent RNA visualization while 139 preserving normal RNA degradation 24 . 140 We developped Moclo vectors adapted to the Golden Gate system 25 to facilitate the 141 cloning and use of the MS2x128 recombinogenic sequence ( Fig S2A ) , and we generated 142 transcriptional fusions with the SPX1 and UNI1 promoters ( Fig . 2A ) . We then introduced into 143 the binary vector used for plant transformation a gene expressing a nuclear targeted MCP - eGFP 144 fusion protein 13 under the control of the weak constitutive Ubiquitin - 10 promoter 26 ( Fig S2A ) . 145 For the two constructs , genetic analysis selected homozygous transformants exhibiting single 146 locus insertions . We first focused on the homozygous pSPX1 : : MS2x128 line named ' S ' for 147 strong and exhibiting the best signals . Molecular analysis revealed the insertion of three copies 148 of the transgene at a single locus in the S line ( Fig S3 ) . The presence of the cap and the polyA 149 tail , crucial elements for RNA stability , was also verified for MS2x128 transcripts ( Fig S4 ) . 150 Single - molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization ( smFISH ) was performed on root squashes 151 to analyze the phosphate response of the transgenes . Root squashing allows good probe 152 penetration in tissues and causes some cells to fall off the root and adhere to coverslips as a 153 monolayer 27 , allowing high quality imaging using wide - field microscopy with high numerical 154 aperture objectives ( Fig . 2B and S2B ) . The fluorescent oligonucleotide probes hybridizing 155 against the MS2 stem - loops labelled the reporter RNA in most tissues of the root grown on Pi 156 depleted medium , including the root cap and mature tissues ( Fig . 2B and see below Fig . 3 ) , and 157 they did not detect signals in Col0 negative controls lacking the transgene ( Fig . S5 ) . 158 Interestingly , the smFISH signals were rarely detected in the cytosol and mostly stained nuclei 159 where transcription sites were visible as bright spots . This nuclear localization could be due to 160 either a nuclear retention of the MS2 - labelled RNA , or a reduced stability in the cytosol . In any 161 case , the smFISH signal disappeared when plants were grown in the presence of phosphate 162 ( Fig . 2B , right panels ) . Quantification of the signals indicated that 74 % of the cells expressed 163 9 the pSPX1 : : MS2x128 transgene in absence of phosphate ( > 20 RNA / cell ) , and none in its 164 presence ( Fig . 2B and 2D ) . To further validate these results , we visualized the endogenous 165 SPX1 transcripts with a mix of 24 fluorescent oligonucleotide probes specific for SPX1 . In Pi 166 depleted conditions , the probes identified the transcription sites and single mRNA molecules 167 present in the cytoplasm , as expected for a translated transcript ( Fig 2C and S2B ) . Similar to 168 the pSPX1 : : MS2x128 reporter , the endogenous SPX1 mRNA was expressed throughout the 169 root , including the cap and mature tissues 28 , with a number of positive cells similar to that of 170 the reporter ( Fig . 2D ) . Importantly , SPX1 smFISH signals were very low in plants growing on 171 Pi rich medium ( Fig 2D and 2C , right panels ) and completely absent in a spx1spx2 double 172 mutant used as negative control ( Fig S6 ) . Overall , these data indicated that the MS2 transgene 173 driven by the SPX1 promoter faithfully reported on the expression of SPX1 , with a similar 174 regulation and spatial expression pattern . 175 176 Imaging transcription in fixed tissues of whole plants with MCP - GFP 177 We then turned to spinning disk confocal microscopy to image plants through the tissue depth 178 ( reaching 100µm ) and to assess in detail the performance of MCP - GFP to image transcription . 179 We first used the brightest homozygous pSPX1 : : MS2x128 line ( called S ) to image expression 180 of the reporter in the root ( Fig . 3A ; a viewer with a zoomable high resolution image can be 181 accessed at https : / / imjoy . io / lite ? plugin = muellerflorian / hani - ms2 : hani - ms2 - sample - 3 and 182 https : / / imjoy . io / lite ? plugin = muellerflorian / hani - ms2 : hani - ms2 - sample - 1 , which is a 183 continuously growing organ with a well - defined architecture . At the apex , the root cap 184 encapsulates the meristematic zone where cells divide rapidly until they enter the transition 185 zone ( TZ ) . Cells then elongate ( EZ ) and initiate tissue differentiation according to a well 186 defined radial pattern , generating a number of different cell types ( Fig . 3A ) . 187 10 First , we tested whether MCP - GFP could faithfully report on the MS2 - tagged RNA and 188 we performed smFISH together with MCP - GFP imaging . In the root cap , which is mostly 189 composed of diploid cells 29 , smFISH against the MS2 stemloops revealed both single molecule 190 and transcription sites , visible as bright spots in the nucleus ( Fig . 3B , bottom panels ; pink and 191 orange arrows , respectively ) . In both root cap ( Fig . 3B ) and mature tissue ( Fig . 3C ) , we 192 observed colocalization between the smFISH signals revealed by MS2 probes and the 193 fluorescent signal produced by MCP - GFP . The transcription sites were easily detected ( Fig . 3B 194 and C , orange arrows ) , and MCP - GFP could also reveal the brightest single mRNAs ( Fig . 3B , 195 pink arrows ) , indicating that the sensitivity of the system approches that of single molecules 196 ( see also below live cell experiments ) . To assess the reliability of detection , we counted 197 transcription sites in both colors , and found that 90 - 95 % of the sites detected by MCP - GFP 198 were also labelled by MS2 smFISH . 199 Finally , we extended these observations to other Arabidopsis lines , using plants having 200 either the pUnicorn1 : : MS2x128 reporter or another single locus transformant of the 201 pSPX1 : : MS2x128 transgene ( J line ) . The J line turned out to also present multiple T - DNA 202 copies ( Fig S3B ) , but it exhibited reduced levels of fluorescence when compared to the S line . 203 The transcription sites of the reporters were readily detected with MCP - GFP and co - localized 204 with the MS2 smFISH signals ( Fig . S7 ) . Overall , these results validated the MS2 / MCP system 205 as a robust and sensitive system to image transcription in whole plants tissues . 206 207 Single molecule counting by smFISH gives insights into the dynamics of transcription in 208 Arabidopsis thaliana 209 The ability of smFISH to detect single RNAs enables a quantitative analysis of the RNA 210 polymerase II transcription cycle 9 , 12 , 30 , 31 . We therefore measured the brightness of transcription 211 sites and used the visible single molecules to compute the absolute number of nascent RNA 212 11 molecules at active transcription sites ( Fig . 4A and B ; see Methods ) . We obtained an average 213 of 37 molecules at the transcription site of the pSPX1 : : MS2x128 reporter for the S lines , with 214 a main peak at ~ 20 molecules ( Fig . 4A ) . We also designed a set of 21 fluorescent 215 oligonucleotides against the sequence immediately downstream the polyadenylation site of the 216 reporter ( see Fig . S12 ) . We however failed to detect any smFISH signal , indicating that 3 ' - end 217 processing was rapid as compared to transcription . This agrees with previous GRO - seq 218 experiments that revealed that RNA polymerases terminate transcription very rapidly after 219 polyA sites 32 , 33 . We repeated these measurements for the endogenous SPX1 mRNA and found 220 an average of 11 . 3 molecules at transcription sites , with a main peak at 9 molecules . Given that 221 the SPX1 gene is 1 . 4 kb long , this number suggests that active SPX1 genes have one polymerase 222 every 77 bases if 3 ' - end processing is immediate , and one polymerase every 120 bases if 3 ' - end 223 processing takes a minute 13 ( assuming an elongation rate of 2 kb / min 30 ) . For the 3kb 224 pSPX1 : : MS2x128 reporter , similar numbers were found if one considers that the peak of 25 225 molecules at a transcription site corresponds to a single active copy ( Fig . 4A ) . These numbers 226 indicate that active SPX1 genes have an initiation event every 2 . 3 to 3 . 5 seconds on average 227 ( see Methods and schematic in Fig . 4B ) . This is in the high range of previous estimates obtained 228 in human cells and Drosophila 13 . It suggests that transcription in Arabidopsis is rapid and occurs 229 in the form of polymerase convoys , produced by initiation events rapidly occurring one after 230 another when the gene turns on 13 . 231 232 Quantitation of SPX1 transcription in fixed roots reveals cell polyploidy in mature tissue 233 as well as large allelic differences 234 Endoreplication occurs frequently in root with DNA cell contents ranging from 2C to 16C 29 . 235 This phenomenon increased as one moves away from the root tip . Being involved in the size of 236 the cells , it also varies and increases from the central to the expended external cell layers such 237 12 as cortex or epidermis 29 ( Fig . 3A ) . The number of transcription sites present in each nucleus 238 highlighted this endoreplication . In the root apex of the pSPX1 : : MS2x128 S line , cells of the 239 columella ( extremity of the root cap ) exhibited in the vast majority of cases no more than two 240 transcription sites for the MS2 reporter or the endogenous SPX1 gene , as expected for a mainly 241 diploid tissue 29 ( Fig . 3B and Fig . 4C for quantifications ) . In contrast , images recorded in the 242 differenciated part of the root revealed the more complex nature of older tissues with the 243 presence of cells with many transcription sites , indicating polyploidy ( Fig . 3C and 2C ) . 244 Quantification of the number of active alleles per cell indicated that in diploid columella cells , 245 only 3 % of the cells had more than 2 transcription sites , while in the mature tissue , 35 % had 246 more than two sites , with 2 % having as many as 7 ( Fig . 4C and 4D ) . Similar numbers were 247 obtained with the endogenous SPX1 gene ( Fig . 4D ) . Interestingly , we noted that in cells with 248 many active alleles , the SPX1 transcription sites frequently clustered in the nucleoplasm , most 249 often forming two groups ( see Fig . 4F for an example ) . To explore this further , we measured 250 the distance between all visible transcription sites in cells having 4 to 8 active sites , and we 251 compared the resulting distance distribution to a situation were we simulated 8 sites with a 252 random location ( Fig . 4E , see Methods ) . This showed that the transcription sites had a non - 253 random distribution and were frequently close to one another , with 40 % of the distances falling 254 within 1 . 5 microns . This phenomenon was also visible when we compared the brightness of 255 transcription sites in cells having one or two transcription sites , to cells having four or more 256 sites ( Fig . S2C ) . Cells with one or two SPX1 transcription sites had a single peak of 10 nascent 257 RNAs , while cells with four or more sites had a second peak at 20 nascent RNAs ( Fig . S2C ) . 258 This suggests that in these cells , some transcription sites had coalesced into a single spot , 259 reminiscent of the ' transcription factories ' previously described in human cells 34 . 260 Next , we compared the activities of the different alleles of single cells , focusing first 261 diploid root cap cells . Surprisingly , an important number of cells exhibited only a single active 262 13 transcription site ( 30 % of the cells ; Fig . 4C ) , or no transcription at all ( 39 % ) . This was also 263 observed with the endogenous SPX1 gene ( Fig . 4D ) , indicating that it is a feature of this 264 Arabidopsis gene and not an artifact of the MS2 reporter . Since the cells with no transcription 265 sites contained smFISH signal in the nucleoplasm or the cytoplasm ( Fig . 3 ) , transcription had 266 been active in these cells , therefore indicating that SPX1 promoter activity was discontinuous . 267 Such discontinuous transcription is the result of gene bursting and has been oberved in many 268 organisms including yeast , Drosophila and mammals 35 . To our knowledge , it has not been 269 reported so far in plants . Gene bursting involves the stochastic switching of a promoter between 270 active and inactive states . It depends on mechanistic aspects of transcription initiation as well 271 as transcriptional regulation 12 . This stochasticity causes variations in gene expression among 272 identical cells ( ie . gene expression noise ) , which has sometimes important phenotypic 273 consequences 12 . Commonly , two sources of noise are distinguished : intrinsic and extrinsic . 274 Intrinsic noise is due to the stochastic nature of biochemical reactions involving a single 275 molecule of DNA and the transcription factors acting on it , and it occurs independently on each 276 allele . In contrast , extrinsic noise modulates similarly both alleles as the result of events 277 affecting the entire cell ( such as cell cycle or activation of a signaling pathway ) . Interestingly , 278 our capability of accessing several alleles within a cell raised the possibility to discriminate 279 between the two causes of transcriptional noise . For each cell that had only one or two active 280 alleles , we plotted the brightness of one SPX1 allele as a function of the other ( Fig . 4G ) . This 281 revealed both correlated ( cells on the diagonal ) and uncorrelated ( cells off the diagonal ) 282 transcriptional activities of these alleles . To quantify this phenomenon further , we measured 283 the total , intrinsic and extrinsic noise 36 , 37 , using cells having either exactly two , or 3 - 4 active 284 transcription sites ( Fig . 4H , see Methods ) . As expected from the results described above , we 285 found that the total noise had significant intrinsic and extrinsic contributions , with intrinsic 286 14 noise being the dominant source . This highlights the quantitative importance of transcriptional 287 noise for Arabidopsis . 288 289 Real - time visualization of SPX1 transcription reveals gene bursting and Pi mediated 290 repression 291 We used a simplified version 38 of the RootChip microfluidic system 22 to combine live - cell 292 imaging with the capacity to change the phosphate solution rapidly ( Fig . 5A and Movies ) . 293 Imaging was performed with spinning disk microscopy , which offered the best compromise 294 between image quality , size of the field of view and image acquisition speed . A typical 295 experiment recorded at each time point a z - stack of 200 images with a z - spacing of 500 nm , 296 allowing us to image at high resolution the entire root and thus access all its tissues . One image 297 stack was recorded every 2 - 3 minutes for ~ 1 hour , and maximum intensity projection produced 298 clear images where multiple transcription sites could be analyzed . Using the brightest S line 299 expressing pSPX1 : : MS2x128 and grown without Pi , images from the first time point confirmed 300 the transcriptional heterogeneity between cells , with neighboring cells exhibiting zero , one , two 301 or even more active transcription sites and with the intensity of transcription sites varying by a 302 factor of 4 ( Fig . 5 - 7 and Movies 3 - 7 ) . Observation of the root constantly supplied with - Pi 303 solution directly demonstrated bursting of the SPX1 promoter , with transcription sites coming 304 on and off over periods of minutes ( Fig . 6 , Movies 1 and 2 ) . Interestingly , this phenomenon 305 was mainly observed in the root cap , and only very rarely in mature tissues . Remarkably , the 306 arrest of transcription after a burst provided an opportunity to visualize the release of single 307 RNAs from the transcription sites ( Fig . 6D , Movie 2 ) , highlighting the dynamics of the process 308 and confirming single molecule sensitivity in live plants . 309 Next , we analyzed the response to Pi resupply . To this end , the S line was first grown 310 during a few days in - Pi liquid medium , before receiving phosphate rich medium combined 311 15 with the Synaptored TM fluorescent dye . This allowed to precisely record the arrival of the 312 supplemented media on the imaging field , thereby defining the time 0 of the time course . The 313 movement of nuclei in the cells and the displacement of cells themselves complicated 314 transcription site tracking . To simplify the analysis of the time course , we therefore used only 315 cells with one or two active transcription sites . The repression of transcription upon Pi resupply 316 proved to be rapid ( Fig . 5 A - C , S8 , S9 and Movies 3 - 7 ) . Signals were then normalized to the 317 value obtained at time 0 ( Fig . 7C ) and an average response curve was produced ( Fig . 7D ) . The 318 measurements were repeated with independent samples and they all showed similar curves with 319 a signal starting to decrease between 0 to 6 minutes after Pi provision at the root surface ( Fig . 320 7E ) . Similar results were obtained with independent transgenic J line ( Fig . S10 , Movie 8 ) , 321 revealing the extraordinary sensitivity and rapidity of the regulatory cascade triggered by Pi . 322 The decrease of fluorescence starting with Pi resupply reached the root continued until 323 it reached a plateau 18 to 25 minutes later ( Fig . 7F and S10 ) . Interestingly , cells presenting 324 multiple transcription sites revealed on average a close coordination of the repression between 325 these sites , indicating that extrinsic factors dominate gene regulation when Pi repression 326 initiates , as expected for a signaling pathway affecting the entire cell ( Fig . 5C , 7B and S8 ) . 327 Controls continuously supplied with Pi depleted solution in mature tissue did not show 328 significant changes ( Fig . 7 G , H and S11 ) over 25 min observation period . 329 The comparison between the MS2 and RTqPCR results revealed a delay of 20 - 30 330 minutes for the RT - qPCR to show the maximum repression , which is in agreement with the 331 SPX1 mRNA half - life previously estimated in the range of 15 - 20 min ( Fig . 1A and S1A , B ) . 332 Overall , these results demonstrate the unexpectedly fast dynamics of the plant response to Pi 333 resupply , and nicely illustrates the capacity of the MS2 system to access transcriptional 334 regulation in live plants . It should be noticed that in mature tissues , we restricted the analysis 335 to nuclei exhibiting one or two active alleles to avoid misattribution during the analysis 336 16 ( resulting from nuclei movement during analysis ) . This favors more central cell ( less affected 337 by polyploidy ) representation , which are known to be less affected by Pi repression compared 338 to cortex or epidermis cells 39 . This may explain the slight difference ( around 10 % ) of average 339 extent of the decrease in expression between RTqPCR and MS2 live imaging . 340 341 Discussion 342 343 Large MS2 arrays and microfluidics reveal single cell transcriptional dynamics in live 344 plants 345 Fluorescent RNA technologies provide access to single molecule studies offering invaluable 346 insights into gene expression mechanisms 12 , 40 . A previous attempt to use these technologies in 347 plants studied a highly abundant viral RNA in transient transformants and low signal - to - noise 348 ratio prevented their use in stable plant lines 41 . The MS2x128 construct developed here ( which 349 uses six time more MS2 loops ) solves this problem and provides a direct acces to transcriptional 350 activities of live plants , at the level of single alleles and with a sensitivity nearing single RNAs . 351 Nevertheless , single molecule detection remains difficult and not exhaustive , due in particular 352 to the necessity of limiting illumination power to prevent bleaching and phototoxicity when 353 acquiring 200 z planes for tens of time points . We hope that new constructions currently 354 underway , where the number of MS2 loops is doubled ( 256 ) or MCP - GFP expression is 355 optimized , will provide important future improvements . Originally developped for yeast or 356 mammalian cell lines , fluorescent tagging of RNA has been introduced in only few 357 multicellular organisms ( Drosophila embryos in particular 10 , 35 ) , mostly to study transcriptional 358 regulation during embryonic development and in absence of external perturbations . Here , the 359 implementation of microfluidics allowed a complete control of environmental conditions and 360 the investigation of the root response to phosphate starvation and resupply . Measurements of 361 transcriptional inhibition often suffer from both indirect measurements introducing a 362 considerable lag time in repression detection , and ensemble measurments averaging effects . In 363 17 contrast , the tools developed here allow visualization of repression in real time and single cells , 364 and demonstrate that it is a very rapid process that takes place in minutes . 365 Plants are sessile organisms that developed exquisitely efficient regulation systems to 366 ensure homeostasis in face of changing environmental conditions . Due to the fast and sensitive 367 tuning of transcriptional mechanisms , microfluidics offers the ideal solution to control 368 environmental conditions . This strategy could be extended to a variety of other stresses , 369 including biotic ones , and to all plant organs as various microfluidic systems exist to study 370 aerial parts . The technological developments made here thus open entirely new possibilities by 371 allowing the direct visualization of transcriptional regulations in living plants , in real time and 372 at the level of single cells and single molecules . 373 374 Integration of single cell responses to phosphate signaling at the tissular level 375 The capacity to dissect transcriptional responses of individual cells within a tissue and between 376 different tissues within an organ is a major step forward . The use of real - time phosphate 377 radioisotope imaging revealed that Pi enters and accumulates in the root tip within less than one 378 minute 42 . The present study thus directly links this arrival with transcriptional repression , 379 demonstrating the close concomitance between the two phenomena . Moreover , our analysis , 380 owing to unprecedented cellular resolution in plants , also identified the heterogeneity of 381 transcriptional responses . Indeed , we observe strikingly different responses to phosphate 382 resupply in different tissues of the root : a cell can repress SPX1 transcription within minutes 383 while its neighbor may continue transcribing unabatedly ( Fig . 3B , 5C and 7 ) . The fact that the 384 alleles of a cell show a coordinated response indicates that this heterogeneity in repression 385 arises mainly from extrinsic sources , as expected for a regulation involving a cellular signaling 386 pathway . Interestingly , the cell - to - cell heterogeneity of SPX1 transcription is already visible at 387 steady state when plants are starved from phosphate : a third of root cap cells contain SPX1 388 18 mRNAs while not being transcriptionally active , indicating discontinuous promoter activity . 389 This peculiar phenomenon of gene bursting is an important driver of cell heterogeneity and has 390 already been described in animals 35 , but not plants . Our analysis suggested that this 391 phenomenon may differ greatly between cell types . Using specific cell layer markers in the 392 future will help to investigate more precisely this phenomenon and decipher putative driving 393 mechanisms . We show here with SPX1 that transcriptional noise in plants has both intrinsic and 394 extrinsic components , suggesting that it arises from both stochastic promoter dynamics and 395 cellular regulatory pathways . At steady state , in absence of Pi , intrinsic noise appears to be 396 dominant , while extrinsic factors appear to take over during Pi refeeding , generating 397 heterogeneity in repression kinetics and in the extent of repression . This needs to be investigated 398 in different organs , developmental stages , physiological statuses and environmental contexts . 399 Because of its role in cell heterogeneity , transcriptional noise is clearly a key point to understand 400 how the activity of individual cells is integrated within entire tissues . 401 402 Transcription imaging in polyploid cells reveals clustering of active alleles 403 Endoreplication in plants has been associated with high metabolic activity or fast biomass 404 development , economically important for most vegetables and fruits . Recent analysis of 405 Arabidopsis illustrated the extent of this process affecting many root cells during their 406 development and differentiation , the highest level of endoploidy ( 16C ) being observed either 407 in most developped cells ( epidermis hair cell ) or in highly active regions associated with 408 distribution of nutrients ( phloem companion cells ) 29 . So far endoploidy detection uses 409 destructive techniques such as flow cytometry or histochemical staining of endocycles markers 410 or DNA . Here , we overcame such limitations providing the opportunities to access kinetics of 411 endoploidy , taking into account development , cell fate , biotic or abiotic stresses . Our results 412 highlighted the magnitude of somatic polyploidy in a root , revealing that many alleles of 413 19 polyploid cells can be simultaneously transcriptionally active . We found that in absence of 414 phosphate , active SPX1 alleles of polyploid cells tended to cluster together , possibly because 415 endoreplicated chromatids generally occupy the same chromosome territory 43 . More 416 surprisingly , our data also suggest that active SPX1 alleles have a propensy to coalesce together , 417 a phenomenon reminiscent of transcriptional factories reported in animal cells 34 . In the future , 418 it will be important to confirm the coalescence of active alleles by directly observing this 419 phenomenon in live cell . It will be also interesting to determine whether this is related to the 420 very high transcriptional activity of the SPX1 gene in these conditions ( one initiation event 421 every 2 - 4 seconds ) , and to understand how this process occurs and whether it contributes to 422 gene regulation . Note that these initiation rates are based on polymerase elongation speed 423 measured in animals or yeast . They do not take into account possible modifications affecting 424 transcription elongation , pausing and termination , which are poorly described in plants despite 425 recent advances 32 , 33 , and will require additional experiments to account for them . 426 427 Overall , the technology presented here offers direct access to the RNA polymerase II activity 428 in live cells and could be used to study crucial plant phenomena affecting transcription 429 ( silencing , heterozygosity , impact of gametophyte origin … ) . This unprecedented spatio - 430 temporal resolution for plant transcription therefore provides new horizons to multiple 431 applications hitherto inaccessible for plant physiology . 432 20 Material and Methods Plant materials and growth conditions Wild type Arabidopsis thaliana Col - 0 seeds were sterilized and grown vertically on Murashige and Skoog medium diluted 10 - fold ( MS / 10 ) in Petri dishes supplemented with a Pi source containing either 500 µM ( + P ) or 13 µM ( - P ) KH 2 PO4 in a culture chamber under a 16 - hr - light / 8 - hr - dark regime ( 25°C / 22°C ) , as previously described 44 . For global transcriptomic analysis , 7 days old seedlings were germinated on a sterile nylon mesh deposited at the surface of the culture medium to facilitate the transfer between media . For resupply experiment , plantlets were transferred from - P to + P for 30 , 60 or 180 minutes . In order to minimize stress related transfer , control plants in - P and + P media were also transferred for similar period of time on same media . In order to get closer to microfluidic conditions and limit the stresses related to the solid media transfer , we modified the protocol for subsequent experiments ( RTqPCR analyses ) , by transferring the 7 days old seedling from agar plate to liquid MS / 10 for 3 days . Then , - P plants were resupplied with + P solution for up to 3 hours before collecting the roots for RNA extraction . Transcription inhibition experiments were performed by addition of 0 . 6 mM cordycepin 45 . For each condition three independent biological replicates were analyzed . Plant DNA extraction and genetic segregation analysis were performed as previously described 46 . RNA - seq library preparation and analysis ( RNA seq and RTqPCR ) The extraction of total RNA from Arabidopsis roots or shoots , the synthesis of RNA - seq libraries and their analysis using Illumina sequencing technology ( Illumina , San Diego , CA ) were performed as previously described 47 . Quantitative RTqPCR experiments were performed as previously described 48 with primers listed in the Supplemental Table 1 . 21 For 7 - Methylgunaosine RNA Immunoprecipitation ( m7G - RIP ) experiment , total RNA was extracted using Monarch Total RNA Miniprep kit including DNAse treatment on column ( New England Biolabs ) . m7G - RIP was then performed as previously described 49 with slight modifications . 5 μg of total RNA was used as starting material . Elution was performed using Guanidium 8M 10 minutes at 65°C followed by RNA precipitation . As negative control , pyrophosphatase treatment was performed on total RNA prior to m7G - RIP . Reverse - transcription was then performed on input and eluate fractions using 500 ng of RNA and oligo dT primer . PCR was then performed using primers against MS2 transgene or endogenous SPX1 using oligos described in Supplemental Table 1 . Transgene constructs The pSPX1 : : MS2x128 and pUNI1 : : MS2x128 constructs were built using the Golden gate cloning technique 25 . MS2x128 stem loops ( pMK123 - MS2X128 - XbaI ) and NOS terminator were inserted into level 0 vectors pICH41308 , and pICH41421 respectively . The promoters of SPX1 ( At5G20150 ) and UNICORN1 ( At5g20790 ) were PCR amplified ( 1452 bp 28 and 2161 bp upstream of the start codon ) using oligos described in Supplemental Table 1 . These sequences were introduced in level0 vectors ( pICH41295 ) . The levels 0 modules were assembled directly into a level 2 expression vector pICH86966 . The Ubiquitin10 promoter ( At4g05320 ) driving eGFP expression derived from pUBN - Dest 26 was assembled with MCP contained in pDONR201 8 using the Gateway cloning technique ( Invitrogen ) creating plasmid pUb : : eGFP / MCP - NLS . This construct was excised from the Gateway vector using PmeI and SmaI ( Invitrogen ) and introduced in level2 T - DNA pSPX1 : : MS2x128 or pUNI1 : : MS2x128 vectors using PmeI restriction sites . A clone having the two constructs in opposite orientations creating pMCP / proSPX1 : : MS2 was used to transform Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1 . Figure S2A summarizes the cloning strategy . The 22 reporter line carrying Luciferase in fusion with the UNICORN1 promoter was generated as previously published 44 . Production of transgenic lines Transformants produced by floral dipping 50 were selected on Hoagland / 2 media complemented with 50 mg / L kanamycin . The progeny exhibiting 3 : 1 segregation were carried to T3 generation to identify homozygous lines carrying a single insertion locus . At least 5 independent lines were obtained for each construct . Single molecule Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization Arabidopsis seedlings were grown on + P and - P agar media . The roots of 7 to 10 day old seedlings were collected and fixed for 30 min with 2 - ( N - morpholino ) ethane sulfonic acid ( MES ) buffer solution pH 5 . 7 containing 4 % paraformaldehyde ( 32 % methanol - free solution ; Electron microscopy Sciences ) . pH was adjusted to 5 . 7 with KOH solution . Roots were rinsed twice with MES buffer ( pH 5 . 8 ) and put onto a microscopic slide with a coverslip . They were smoothly squashed ( to splay them and produce a single cell layer ) and submerged briefly in liquid nitrogen . Then , after removing coverslips , they were left out to dry at room temperature for one hour . To permeabilize the samples , the slides were immersed in 70 % ethanol overnight on a rotary shaker prior to hybridization . The ethanol was evaporated at room temperature before washing the roots with MES . SmFISH was used for the detection of MS2 repeats and endogenous SPX1 mRNAs . The MS2 probe was made of a mix of 10 pre - labelled fluorescent oligos directed against 32xMS2 repeats 13 . Each oligo contains 2 to 4 molecules of Cy3 and hybridizes 4 times across 128xMS2 repeats , allowing the binding of 40 probes to each single RNA molecule . The set of SPX1 probes was made of a mix of 24 fluorescent oligonucleotides carrying 2 to 3 Cy3 fluorophores and 23 covering the entire SPX1 transcript including 5’ and 3’ UTR ( Table S2 ) . The pre - hybridization was performed in 1xSSC / 40 % formamide buffer for 15 min at room temperature . Hybridization was performed with 2 ng / µl probe and in 40 % formamide for MS2 , whereas for SPX1 only 15 % formamide was used . The smiFISH probe mix directed against the post - polyA region of the MS2 construct was made of 21 oligonucleotides ( Table S2 ) and hybridized as previously described 51 . After addition of probes , samples were covered with a coverslip and remained overnight at 37°C as previously described 51 . For rinsing , after coverslip removal , root samples were washed twice during 45 min at 37°C with freshly prepared 1xSSC / 40 % formamide buffer and rinsed at room temperature with MES pH 5 . 8 buffer and dried . A drop of Prolong Diamond antifade mounting medium ( Invitrogen ) containing DAPI was added prior to observation . For long - term storage , slides were kept at - 20°C . Fluorescence imaging of fixed plants SmFISH and MCP - GFP images were taken using either a spinning disk confocal or a wide field microscope . For spinning disk microscopy , we used a Dragonfly ( Oxford instrument ) equipped with four laser lines ( 405 , 488 , 561 , 637 nm ) and an ultrasensitive EMCCD camera ( iXon Life 888 , Andor ) mounted on a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 microscope body , using a 40x , NA 1 . 3 Plan Fluor oil objective or a 60x , NA 1 . 4 Plan Apochromat oil objective coupled with a supplementary lens of 2x , using z - stacks with a 0 . 5 (cid:0) m or 0 . 4 (cid:0) m step . For widefield imaging , we used a Zeiss Axioimager Z1 widefield upright microscope equipped with a camera sCMOS ZYLA 4 . 2 MP ( Andor ) , using a 100x , NA 1 . 4 Plan Apochromat oil objective . For these z stacks , a step of 0 . 3 or 0 . 4 (cid:0) m was used . Maximal image projections ( MIP ) were generated with ImageJ , and figures were realized using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator . The mosaic of Figure 3A is accessible with a viewer run with Imjoy 52 . Note that plant fixation and smFISH both reduced the GFP signals . 24 Analysis and quantifications of smFISH images Quantification of the brightness of transcription sites was made with a modified version of HotSpot 40 . This is a user - friendly MatLab software that allows to quantify smFISH signals in very noisy images , unlike FISH - quant 53 , 54 . Briefly , the user can navigate in 2D or 3D bicolor images to manually select transcription sites and single RNAs , and the script finds the local maxima and fits 2D or 3D gaussians to the selected transcription spots . The images of single RNAs are averaged and also fitted to 2D or 3D gaussians , and the integrated intensity of the transcription sites are divided by the intensity of average of single RNAs , yielding the exact number of molecules present at transcription sites . In this work , quantifications were done in 2D on MIPs using 100 - 500 single RNA per image to generate the average . HotSpot is available on GitHub ( https : / / github . com / muellerflorian / hotspot ) . To calculate initiation rates , we assumed that initiation occurs at random with a constant rate . This produces a uniform distribution of RNA polymerases along the SPX1 gene following arithmetic series . Because the MS2 and SPX1 probes are distributed homogeneously along the corresponding pre - mRNAs , incomplete nascent RNAs are labelled with only a fraction of the probes . If one assumes that the pre - mRNAs immediately leave the transcription site once polymerases reach the 3 ' - end of the gene ( in agreement with experimental data ) , the barycenter of the polymerase distribution is the middle of the gene , and the average brightness of a nascent pre - mRNA is thus half that of a full - length pre - mRNA . In this case , the number of polymerase on the gene , Npol , is thus twice the brightness of transcription sites , expressed in number of full - length pre - mRNA ( noted TS RNA ) . Assuming an elongation rate of 2kb / min , the time to transcribe the gene , t el , is 42 s , and the average initiation rate is Npol divided by t el . If the pre - mRNA takes t proc seconds to be 3 ' - end processed and released from the transcription site , then 25 Npol is TS RNA * [ 2 * t el / ( t el + t proc ) + t proc / ( t el + t proc ) ] , and the initiation rate is Npol divided by ( t el + t proc ) . To analyze the distribution of distances separating active transcription sites within single nuclei , we computed for each nuclei all the distances between all the visible transcription sites . To simulate a random distribution of transcription sites , Arapidopsis nuclei were simulated as ellipses with a major axis length of 12 (cid:0) m and a minor axis length of 6 (cid:0) m , and we randomly selected points using a uniform distribution in the ellipse surface . To measure total ( n tot ) , extrinsic ( n ext ) and intrinsic ( n int ) noise for cells with any number of alleles , we used an extension of the approaches previously developed 36 , 37 . For a population of cells with n alleles , we considered the brightness of the transcription sites of the n alleles , expressed in number of full - length pre - mRNA molecules , as n random variables . We computed the corresponding variance - covariance matrix of these n variables and defined n tot as the root square of the mean of the variances given by the matrix diagonal , n ext as the root square of the mean of the covariances obtained by the non - diagonal values of the matrix , and n int as the root square of n tot2 - n ext2 . The error in n tot , n int and n ext was estimated by randomly attributing each of the n transcription sites to the n alleles , calculating n tot , n int and n ext and repeating this 100 times to calculate the standard deviation of the values obtained . In Figure 2D , he number of expressing cells ( i . e . cells having at least 20 RNA molecules in the nucleus or the cytoplasm ) , as well as the number of transcription site per cell ( see Fig . 4C - D ) , was counted manually from 2D MIP smFISH images . The plot of Figure 4 were generated in R and incorporated in the figure using Adobe Illustrator . Rootchips and in vivo live plants imaging experiments For these experiments , we used brightest line obtained with SPX1 promoter ( the S and J lines ) . Transgenic seeds were germinated in conical cylinders produced from micropipette tips filled 26 with - P agar and inserted into sterile - P agar plates . 5 to 7 day old Pi deficient seedlings were then transferred into a RootChips 22 , 38 , grown vertically and fed with a Pi deficient nutritive solution at a low flow pressure until the root grew in the channel . For refeeding experiment , the nutritive solution was changed from – Pi to + Pi . Synaptored TM C2 ( 5µg / mL , Ozyme ) was added into the + P solution to detect the arrival time of Pi ( defining t = 0 ) . In vivo movies were recorded with an Andor Dragonfly spinning disk mounted on a Nikon Eclipse Ti using 40x Plan - Apo water objective ( 1 . 15 NA ; 0 . 6 mm DT ) . Z - stacks were made every 3 minutes with a scan size of 100 - 150µm ( 0 . 5µm step size ; ~ 200 steps per Z - stack ) . The data was analyzed with the ImageJ software using the TrackMate plugin to track transcription sites on 2D MIPs . The intensity of SPX1 transcription sites was assessed for several nuclei per sample . In each nucleus , the mean intensity of the nuclear background was subtracted to the maximum intensity of SPX1 transcription site , and the resulting intensities were plotted against time . 27 Figure Legends Figure 1 : I dentification of fast responsive transcripts regulated at transcriptional level by phosphate resupply .
