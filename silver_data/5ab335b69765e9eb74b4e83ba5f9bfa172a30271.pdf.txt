Studies in mammalian cell lines suggested that EPS15 and EPS15L1 regulate endocytosis in a redundant manner . However , at the or - ganismal level , it is not known to which extent the functions of the two proteins overlap . Here , by exploiting various constitutive and conditional null mice , we report redundant and nonredundant functions of the two proteins . EPS15L1 displays a unique non - redundant role in the nervous system , whereas both proteins are fundamental during embryo development as shown by the embry - onic lethality of - Eps15 / Eps15L1 - double KO mice . At the cellular level , the major process redundantly regulated by EPS15 and EPS15L1 is the endocytosis of thetransferrin receptor , a pathway that sustains the development of red blood cells and controls iron homeostasis .

The process is achieved by a variety of entry portals and routes , among which clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is the best characterized one ( McMahon & Boucrot , 2011 ; Sigismund et al , 2012 ; Kirchhausen et al , 2014 ; Robinson , 2015 ) . In addition , endocytosis can occur through clathrin - independent routes ( non - clathrin endocytosis ) , whose molecular determinants and cargo speci ﬁ city are being elucidated ( Lundmark et al , 2008 ; Sigismund et al , 2012 , 2013 ; Boucrot et al , 2015 ; Renard et al , 2015 ; Elkin et al , 2016 ; Caldieri et al , 2017 ) . Besides clathrin , the main actors of CME are the endocytic adaptors , whose main function is to bridge the membrane cargo with the coat . Endocytic adaptor proteins include the clathrin adaptor protein 2 complex ( AP2 ) and a plethora of accessory adaptor proteins , among which are EPS15 ( EGFR pathway substrate 15 ) and EPS15L1 ( EGFR pathway substrate 15 like - 1 ) , which control cargo selection and maturation of the vesicles ( Mettlen et al , 2009 ; Traub , 2009 ; Kirchhausen et al , 2014 ; Merri ﬁ eld & Kaksonen , 2014 ) . EPS15 and EPS15L1 share 41 % identity and 61 % similarity . They were originally discovered as substrates of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) ( Fazioli et al , 1993 ; Schumacher et al , 1995 ; Coda et al , 1998 ; Salcini et al , 1999 ) and display features of multi - domain scaffolding proteins , containing from N terminus to C ter - minus : ( i ) three copies of the EH protein – binding module ( Wong et al , 1995 ; Di Fiore et al , 1997 ; Confalonieri & Di Fiore , 2002 ) , which can interact with various endocytic proteins ( Salcini et al , 1997 ; Polo et al , 2003 ) ; ( ii ) AP2 - binding sites ( Benmerah et al , 1996 ; Iannolo et al , 1997 ) ; and ( iii ) ubiquitin - binding domains , UIMs ( Polo et al , 2002 ) . In line with their homology , in vitro studies indicated that EPS15 and EPS15L1 are redundant components of the endocytic machinery : they share the same binding partners ( van Bergen En Henegouwen , 2009 ) and en - docytosis is redundantly affected when both proteins are functionally impaired . In particular , RNA interference of EPS15 and EPS15L1 in HeLa cells showed that these proteins are redundantly required for the CME of the transferrin receptor ( TfR ) , a prototype of constitutive endocy - tosis , and of the EGFR , a prototype of ligand - induced endocytosis ( Huang et al , 2004 ) . Moreover , EPS15 and EPS15L1 were found to re - dundantlyregulatealsothenon - clathrinendocytosisofEGFR , together with the endocytic adaptor epsin - 1 ( Sigismund et al , 2005 ) . Finally , upon activation of the EGFR , both proteins can be post - translationally modi ﬁ ed , including tyrosine phosphorylation ( Fazioli et al , 1993 ; Coda et al , 1998 ) and mono - ubiquitination ( van Delft et al , 1997 ; Woelk et al , 2006 ) , and these modi ﬁ cations are required 1 IFOM , Fondazione Istituto FIRC ( Fondazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro ) di Oncologia Molecolare , Milan , Italy 2 Cogentech Societ ` a Bene ﬁ t Srl , Milan , Italy 3 Experimental Imaging Centre , Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scienti ﬁ co , San Raffaele Scienti ﬁ c Institute , Milan , Italy 4 IEO , Istituto Europeo di Oncologia IRCCS ( Istituti di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scienti ﬁ co ) , Milan , Italy 5 Universit ` a degli Studi di Milano , Dipartimento di Oncologia ed Emato - oncologia , Milan , Italy 6 Dipartimento di Medicina Sperimentale , Universit ` a degli Studi di Genova , Genoa , Italy Correspondence : nina . offenhauser @ cogentech . it ; sara . sigismund @ ieo . it Sara Sigismund and Nina Offenh¨auser jointly supervised this work . © 2019 Milesi et al . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 26508 / lsa . 201800273 vol 2 | no 1 | e201800273 1 of 11 to assist during EGFR - CME ( Torrisi et al , 1999 ; Confalonieri et al , 2000 ; Savio et al , 2016 ) . At the organismal level , studies in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster , where only one gene of the eps15 family exists , indicate that EPS15 plays an essential function in the nervous system , regulating synaptic vesicle recycling ( SVR ) ( Salcini et al , 2001 ; Koh et al , 2007 ) . The single Eps15 KO in mice , where both Eps15 and Eps15L1 exist , isviableandfertile . MEFsderivedfromthesemicedidnot display defects in TfR endocytosis ( Pozzi et al , 2012 ) , suggesting that EPS15L1 — which is expressed in this setting — possibly compensates the lack of EPS15 . Their redundancy , however , has never been demon - strated in in vivo settings . Moreover , neither in vitro nor in vivo studies have so far revealed nonredundant essential functions . The present studies were undertaken to shed light on these questions . Results and Discussion The Eps15L1 - KO is perinatal lethal To investigate the functions of EPS15L1 at the organismal level , we generated Eps15L1 - KO ( Eps15L1 - KO ) mice by deleting the ﬁ rst coding exon ( Fig S1 ) . Although deletion of Eps15 , as previously reported , did not affect viability ( Pozzi et al , 2012 ) , only 10 % of the weaned pups were Eps15L1 - KO ( instead of the expected 25 % , Fig 1A ) , indicating that EPS15L1 is required for neonatal viability , albeit with incom - plete penetrance . Eps15L1 - KO mice were born at the expected Mendelian ratio and were indistinguishable from WT littermates . Following the litters directly after birth revealed that newborn Eps15L1 - KO died within the ﬁ rst 2 d of birth ( Fig 1B ) without any obvious morphological defects . The neonatal lethality of Eps15L1 - KO mice , at variance with Eps15 - KO , indicated a unique nonredundant function for EPS15L1 . EPS15L1 is preferentially expressed in the nervous system and the Eps15L1 - KO displays neurological de ﬁ cits The time of neonatal lethality of Eps15L1 - KO mice and their normal in utero development was not immediately consistent with a cause of death because of failure of major organs , such as the heart , lungs , or kidneys ( Turgeon & Meloche , 2009 ) . Thus , as an initial step towards the understanding of the nonredundant function of EPS15L1 , we analyzed its tissue distribution versus EPS15 . EPS15 was expressed at similar levels in most of the analyzed tissues ( Fig S2A ) . EPS15L1 , instead , displayed prominent expression in the brain and Figure 1 .

By immuno ﬂ uorescence analysis of the hippocampus in adult mouse brain sections , both EPS15 and EPS15L1 localized to neurons , and EPS15 also showed substantial staining in cells with astrocytic morphology ( Fig S2C ) . Of interest , EPS15L1 showed co - localization with synaptophysin , a presynaptic marker , whereas EPS15 did not ( Fig S2C ) . This was further corroborated by a biochemical fractionation of adult mouse brain in which we compared the total homogenate ( H ) to the synaptosomal fraction and to the postsynaptic density . Of the several endocytic proteins tested , EPS15L1 was the sole one clearly enriched in the synaptosomal fraction ( marginal enrichment was also detected for dynamin and AP2 ; Fig S2D ) . Based on the above results , we performed a series of neurological tests on newborn Eps15L1 - KO ( Fig 1C ) . We observed no difference in the tail suspension test , which assesses a re ﬂ ex circuit in - volving the brainstem ( Fig 1C ) . Conversely , in the nociceptive tail ﬂ ick test , we scored a signi ﬁ cant reduction of reactivity in Eps15L1 - KO versus WT controls ( Fig 1C ) . More importantly , we observed lack of feeding in 90 % of Eps15L1 - KO pups , as evi - denced by the absence of milk in their stomach , which rep - resents the probable cause of death of these animals ( Fig 1C ) . In addition , we observed dif ﬁ culties in respiratory activity at the second day after birth in most of the Eps15L1 - KO pups ( Fig 1C ) , which might be either a primary defect or secondary to malnu - trition . Of note , Eps15L1 - KO mice that escaped perinatal death showed reduced growth rate ( Fig S2E and F ) , neurological de ﬁ cits ( Fig S2G ) , and succumbed at 6 – 8 wk . In contrast , we have previously published that EPS15 - KO mice do not show any neurological ab - normality ( Pozzi et al , 2012 ) . In summary , EPS15L1 — in contrast to EPS15 — is required for life in mice , possibly inconjunction withan essentialnonredundantfunction of EPS15L1 in the nervous system . Evidence for a nonredundant role of EPS15L1 in synaptic function The sum of the above data and the lessons learned in model or - ganisms ( Salcini et al , 2001 ; Koh et al , 2007 ) prompted us to in - vestigate a possible role for EPS15L1 in SVR . In the Drosophila model system , the ablation of eps15 was accompanied by a sizable decrease in the levels of dynamin and intersectin ( Majumdar et al , 2006 ; Koh et al , 2007 ) . Thus , we initially assessed the levels of a panel of endocytic proteins in the brain of newborn Eps15 - KO and Eps15L1 - KO mice . We observed no differences in the levels of expression of most of the proteins , including the core components of the endocytic machinery : AP2 , dynamin , and clathrin ( Fig 2A ) . An ~ 50 % decrease in the levels of intersectin - 1 was detected in Eps15L1 - KO mice ( Fig 2A and B ) . This reduction appears to be speci ﬁ c for intersectin - 1 , as other presynaptic ( e . g . , synapsin , synaptophysin , and VGAT ) or postsynaptic ( e . g . , GluR1 ) markers did not signi ﬁ cantly change between Eps15L1 - KO and Eps15L1 - WT mice ( Fig2AandB ) . WeconcludedthattheKOofeither Eps15L1 or Eps15 doesnothaveageneralimpactontheexpressionlevelsofthesynaptic proteins . Next , we performed an FM dye – based SVR assay on mature neurons cultured for 14 d in vitro . Fluorescence was measured after a ﬁ rst depolarization in the presence of the dye induced by KCl ( F1 , Fig 2C , left ) and then again after a second depolarization ( F2 , Fig 2C , left ) to measure dye release from synaptic vesicles . We did not detect any signi ﬁ cant difference in either F1 or F2 , arguing for no apparent defects in SVR ( Fig 2C , right ) . However , compensatory endocytic mechanisms might mask a defect in classical SVR ( Nguyen et al , 2014 ) ; thus , we proceeded with an ultrastructural analysis of Eps15L1 - KO neurons . We detected a reduction of synaptic vesicles in Eps15L1 - KO synapses of about 50 % , although synapses from Eps15 - KO were comparable with WT ( Fig 2D ) . The number of docked / tethered vesicles was also signi ﬁ cantly decreased in Eps15L1 - KO synapses ( Fig 2E ) . This result is reminiscent of similar defects evidenced in model organisms ( Salcini et al , 2001 ; Koh et al , 2007 ) and suggested that defective synaptic function may be respon - sible for the neurological de ﬁ cits of Eps15L1 - KO mice and possibly for neonatal lethality . To test whether the absence of evident phenotypes in the dye uptake assay was due to the up - regulation of compensatory bulk endocytosis , we measured by EM the number of vesicles with a diameter higher than 80 nm , as bulk endocytosis is typically char - acterized by large invaginations of the plasma membrane which then ﬁ ssion to form endosomal - like compartments ( Cousin , 2009 ; Saheki & De Camilli , 2012 ) . Under steady state conditions , we did not observe differences in the number of this type of vesicles ( Fig 2F ) . However , when we followed HRP uptake upon depolarization with 50 mM KCl ( Fig 2G , left ) , we observed a signi ﬁ cant increase in large HRP - positive structures in Eps15L1 - KO neurons ( Fig 2G , center and right ) , suggesting that bulk endocytosis is indeed more active in these cells . EPS15 and EPS15L1 are redundantly essential in embryonic development To investigate possible organismal redundant roles for EPS15 and EPS15L1 , we generated Eps15 / Eps15L1 - double KO ( DKO ) mice by inter - crossing Eps15 - KO / Eps15L1 - HET . DKO embryos died shortly after 9 . 5 d post coitum ( dpc ) ( Fig 3A ) , and already at 9 . 5 dpc , they showed severe morphological defects . Some of them presented severe developmental delay ; all embryos , instead , displayed re - duced midbrain – hindbrain boundary , fused somites , absence of limb bud , and delayed turning of the heart . Moreover , DKO embryos appeared paler than their controls ( Fig 3B ) , possibly because of reduced vascularization or a defect in hematopoiesis , or both . PECAM staining of the vascular system effectively evidenced a reduced vascularization both of the embryo proper as well as of the yolk sac ( Fig 3C and D ) . A more detailed confocal analysis of the PECAM staining con ﬁ rmed the reduced and compromised vascularization of the head , somites , and yolk sac ( Fig 3E ) of DKO embryos . To further characterize the vascular phenotype , we generated mice in which Eps15L1 was constitutively deleted and Eps15 was con - ditionally deleted under the Tie2 promoter ( Eps15 ﬂ p / ﬂ p / Eps15L1 − / − / Tie2 - Cre tg , referred to as conditional Eps15 - KO / constitutive Eps15L1 - KO , c15 / L1KO ) . These mice displayed only a mild vascular defect ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the severe phenotype observed in constitutive DKO mice was not due to a cell - autonomous defect of endothelial cells .

We concentrated on erythrocyte maturation for a series of reasons : ( i ) the pallor of the Eps15 / Eps15L1 - DKO mice ; ( ii ) the re - dundant impact of EPS15 and EPS15L1 on TfR internalization ( [ Huang et al , 2004 ] and Fig 4A ) ; ( iii ) the known role of TfR internalization in erythrocyte maturation ( Levy et al , 1999 ; Zhu et al , 2008 ; Ishikawaetal , 2015 ; Muckenthaler et al , 2017 ) ; and ( iv ) the availability of c15 / L1KO mice . First , we investigated the expression of EPS15 and EPS15L1 during erythrocyte maturation . Mice were treated with phenylhydrazine ( PHZ ) to induce hemolytic anemia and formation of immature RBCs ( Fig S3A and B ) . Consistent with a role in maturation of RBCs , we observed high levels of expression of EPS15 and EPS15L1 at the peak of immature RBCs ( 7 – 10 d after PHZ treatment ) , which dramatically decreased at 16 d ( Fig S3C ) . The same kinetics were observed for TfR , intersectin - 1 , and AP2 , compatible with a role for all these proteins in determining the wave of TfR required for maturation of RBCs ( Fig S3C ) . We then turned to the c15 / L1KO mice . Analysis of the peripheral blood of newborn c15 / L1KO mice revealed a signi ﬁ cant reduction Figure 2 . EPS15L1 has a nonredundant role in neurons .

In the brain , two isoforms for intersectin - 1 are present ( ITSN1 - l refers to the long isoform and ITSN1 - s refers to the short isoform ) . Clathrin HC refers to clathrin heavy chain . Reduction of synaptophysin in Eps15L1 - KO mice might be linked to a reduction in synapses , as observed in Drosophila eps15 mutants ( Koh et al , 2007 ) ; the reduction of intersectin - 1 , which directly interacts with EPS15L1 , instead , might indicate a destabilization of the protein when it is not complexed .

Mice in which only Eps15 was deleted under the Tie2 promoter ( Eps15 ﬂ p / ﬂ p / Tie2 - Cre tg , referred to as conditional Eps15 - KO , c15KO ) displayed a minor , if any , reduction in MCV , whereas constitutive single Eps15L1 - KO ( L1KO ) had no phenotype . Finally , May – Grünwald – Giemsa staining revealed the presence of an - isotropic RBCs and a signi ﬁ cant increase in reticulocyte number speci ﬁ cally in c15 / L1KO mice ( Fig 4C and D ) . To analyze adult hematopoiesis , we generated mice in which both Eps15 and Eps15L1 were conditionally deleted under the Tie2 promoter ( Eps15 ﬂ p / ﬂ p / Eps15L1 ﬂ p / ﬂ p / Tie2 - Cre tg , conditional Eps15 / Eps15L1 - DKO , referred to as cDKO ) . Western blotting analysis on major tissues ( the brain , liver , and spleen ) con ﬁ rmed that Eps15 and Eps15L1 were deleted in Tie2 + cells ( Tang et al , 2010 ) of cDKO mice ( Fig S3D ) . Adult cDKO mice were anemic as revealed by signi ﬁ cant reduction of all analyzed parameters ( Fig 4E ) . May – Grünwald – Giemsa staining revealed a great variation in the size and shape of cDKO RBCs ( Fig 4F , top ) . Finally , o - dianisidine staining clearly showed that RBCs from cDKO were hypochromic ( Fig 4F , bottom ; additional characterizations of iron metabolism , in cDKO mice , are shown in Fig S3E and F ) . Thus , cDKO mice suffer from microcytic hypochromic anemia ( Levy et al , 1999 ; Zhu et al , 2008 ; Ishikawa et al , 2015 ) . EPS15 and EPS15L1 redundantly regulate TfR internalization in RBCs In search of a molecular explanation for the RBC phenotype in cDKO mice , we concentrated on TfR endocytosis . We reasoned that the phenotype of cDKO ( impaired maturation of RBCs and increased serum iron ) could be explained by defective iron uptake through TfR endocytosis in RBCs of these mice . To discriminate mature RBCs from reticulocytes , we used thiazole orange ( TO ) to detect the nucleic acids in immature RBCs . Consistent with defective erythrocyte maturation , we detected twice as many reticulocytes ( TO - positive cells , TO + ) in the blood of cDKO ( 5 . 5 ± 0 . 4 in WT versus 10 . 7 ± 1 . 5 in cDKO , P < 0 . 001 [ Fig 4G , top ] ) . In addition , surface TfR expression was retained in ~ 50 % of mature RBCs ( TO - negative cells , TO − ) in cDKO mice , whereas it was virtually absent — as expected — in WT mice ( Fig 4G , bottom , and H ) . Finally , in cDKO mice , a signi ﬁ cantly higher fraction of TO + retained TfR surface expres - sion versus the WT counterparts ( Fig 4G , bottom , and H ) . Redundancy and uniqueness of EPS15 and EPS15L1 We have herein characterized a number of redundant and non - redundant functions of EPS15 and EPS15L1 at the organismal level in mice . In our previous work , we showed that Eps15 - KO mice are viable and fertile and , notwithstanding extensive phenotype screening , showed only a partial defect in B - cell lymphopoiesis ( Pozzi et al , 2012 ) . At variance , we show here that Eps15L1 - KO mice show readily detectable neurological defects , associated with reduced number of synaptic vesicles , and neonatal lethality . We have not proved that the neonatal phenotype is a direct consequence of the neurological defect and of altered SVR . Neuronal - speci ﬁ c conditional KO will be needed to address this issue . However , we note that the depletion in synaptic vesicles detected in Eps15L1 - KO mice is highly remi - niscent of the phenotypes observed in the nematode and in ﬂ ies , upon deletion of the sole orthologue of Eps15 in these species . In these latter cases , it was established that the SVR phenotype was responsible for the neurological defects and , in the case of Dro - sophila , for lethality ( Salcini et al , 2001 ; Koh et al , 2007 ) . Our studies also allowed the identi ﬁ cation of a number of re - dundant functions of Eps15 and Eps15L1 . These two genes are re - quired ( redundantly ) for correct embryo development . The severity and complexity of the phenotype argues for the possibility that not a single but a multitude of signaling pathways is affected in these mice : a possibility compatible with the role of these proteins in a pervading process such as endocytosis . At the phenotypic level , one major alteration , which might contribute importantly to the lethal phenotype of DKO embryos , was subverted angiogenesis . This phe - notype , however , was non – cell autonomous , and its exact mechanism remains to be elucidated . One redundant function that we were able to precisely dissect , both cellularly and molecularly , concerns erythropoiesis . Here , we Figure 3 .

Organismal functions of EPS15 and EPS15L1 Milesi et al . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 26508 / lsa . 201800273 vol 2 | no 1 | e201800273 5 of 11 showed that EPS15 and EPS15L1 are redundantly required for the internalization of the TfR , which at the organismal level leads to microcytic hypochromic anemia when lacking in the hemato - poietic system . These results are reminiscent of those obtained in hematopoietic - speci ﬁ c KO mice for PICALM , an accessory endo - cytic adaptor and binding partner of EPS15 and EPS15L1 . These mice suffered from microcytic hypochromic anemia , displaying reduced RBCs , haemoglobin , haematocrit , and MCV , and increased reticulocyte number and serum iron ( Ishikawa et al , 2015 ) . Moreover , also in these mice , anemia was caused by defective TfR internalization in RBCs . Evolutionarily , the duplication of the ancestral Eps15 locus must have occurred in a vertebrate ancestor , within metazoan , because all vertebrates display two orthologues , whereas in - vertebrates possess only one ( Fig S3G ) . By analyzing compara - tively the results in invertebrates ( Salcini et al , 2001 ; Koh et al , 2007 ) and in mammals ( [ Pozzi et al , 2012 ] and this study ) , it is likely that the essential functions of proto - EPS15 were retained by EPS15L1 , whereas EPS15 diverged to assume more ﬁ ne - tuning roles , while retaining a large ( albeit not complete ) spectrum of redundancy with EPS15L1 . This possibility is supported by the Figure 4 . Deletion of Eps15 and Eps15L1 in the hematopoietic system causes microcytic hypochromic anemia .

Organismal functions of EPS15 and EPS15L1 Milesi et al . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 26508 / lsa . 201800273 vol 2 | no 1 | e201800273 6 of 11 closer similarity of vertebrate EPS15L1s with the invertebrate orthologues and by the slower rate of divergence of this gene versus EPS15 , during vertebrate radiation ( Fig S3G ) . The high degree of similarity and collinearity between the two genes / proteins should now enable structure – function experiments to unmask the structural determinant responsible for the unique function of EPS15L1 in neurons . Materials and Methods Generation and maintenance of mouse strains The Eps15 - KO was previously described ( Pozzi et al , 2012 ) . The conditional Eps15 - KO allele ( Eps15 tm1a ( KOMP ) Wtsi , in the text referred to as Eps15 ﬂ p / ﬂ p ) was obtained from the Sanger Institute . The PGK - neo cassette was removed by breeding to general deleter Flp mice and the Flp transgene was removed in subsequent breedings . The Eps15L1 - KO was generated in a C57BL6 background by Ozgene , through insertion of a PGK - neo cassette next to the ﬁ rst coding exon . The ﬁ rst exon and the PGK - neo cassette were removed by crossing with general deleter Cre mice and the Cre transgene was removed in subsequent breedings . The conditional Eps15L1 - KO allele ( Eps15L1 ﬂ p / ﬂ p ) was obtained from Polygene . The PGK - neo cassette was removed by breeding to general deleter Flp mice and the Flp transgene was removed by subsequent breedings . For isolation of MEFs , Eps15 ﬂ p / ﬂ p mice were crossed with Eps15L1 + / − and Rosa26 CreERT2 mice ( Ventura et al , 2007 ) . For hematological studies , Eps15 ﬂ p / ﬂ p mice were crossed with Eps15L1 + / − or Eps15L1 ﬂ p / ﬂ p and Tie2 - Cre tg mice ( Kisanuki et al , 2001 ) to obtain deletion of the ﬂ oxed genes in endothelial and hema - topoietic cells . Mice were kept on 12 h light / dark cycle with ad libitum access to water and food . Experiments were performed in accordance with our institution guidelines and the Italian Laws ( Project numbers : 06 / 12 and 222 / 16 ) . Behavioral test Neonatal behavior tests were scored giving either a normal or ab - normal evaluation to the observed phenotype . To evaluate neonatal motor and nociception functions , pups were subjected to the tail suspension and the tail ﬂ ick test , respectively ( Sternberg et al , 2004 ; Takahashi et al , 2010 ) . In the tail suspension test , the pup was gently held by the tip of the tail and the position observed recorded . A normal reaction was scored when the pup was hanging symmetrically with all four limbs wide open . The test was scored as abnormal if the hind limbs were touching or clasping during the test . In the tail ﬂ ick test , the pup was held between the thumb and fore ﬁ nger in an upright position and the distal tip of the tail was gently lowered into a water bath maintained at 50°C . The latency to vigorous tail withdrawal was recorded , with a 15 - s cutoff time . The test was repeated after a 30 - s interval and the latencies were averaged . Tail withdrawl within 15 s was scored as normal , whereas longer retraction times were scored as abnormal . The feeding status was estimated at the day of birth by carefully observing the pups for the presence of milk in the stomach , which is visible through the thin abdominal skin of pups . The respiration behavior was assessed by visual examination . Ap - neas , sighs , gasps , paroxysmal , or periodic breathing were considered as pathological . All tests were performed in blind respect to the genotype of the animals . Primary culture of hippocampal neurons Primary neurons were isolated from hippocampi dissected from P0 newborn mice and placed in cold HBSS buffer . Digestion of the hippocampi was performed at 37°C in water bath for 10 min using papain ( 20 U / ml ﬁ nal ) in EBSS buffer with the addition of DNase ( 500 U / ml ﬁ nal ) ( all from Worthington Biochemical Corporation ) . After trituration of the solution , the cell pellet was washed two times in EBSS and resuspended in Neurobasal - A medium supplemented with B27 , GlutaMAX , and antibiotics ( all from Life Technologies ) . The cells were plated onto glass cov - erslips or glass bottom dishes ( MatTek Corporation ) coated with 1 mg / ml poly - D - lysine hydrobromide ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Primary cultures from hippocampal neurons were used at 14 d from their isolation . Dye uptake experiments For dye uptake experiments , FM1 - 43 dye ( Molecular probes from Life Technologies ) was used at a concentration of 1 μ m . Recovery buffer contained 130 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 25 mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 33 ) , and 30 mM glucose . Stimulation buffer contained as above except for 85 mM NaCl and 50 mM KCl . DL - 2 - amino - 5 - phosphonopentanoic acid ( AP - V ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , CNQX ( Ascent Scienti ﬁ c ) , and sodium kynurenate ( Ascent Scienti ﬁ c ) were added to all solutions , except HBSS , at the ﬁ nal concentration of 50 μ M , 100 μ M , and 1 mM , respectively . Dye uptake experiments of primary hippocampal neurons were performed at room temperature as follows : the cells were incu - bated 3 min in recovery buffer with dye and then stimulated with stimulation buffer with dye for 90 s , following 10 min in recovery buffer with dye . After 10 min of several washes in HBSS buffer ( Life Technologies ) , neurons were bathed for 2 min in HBSS with 10 mM ADVASEPT ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and washed two times with HBSS alone . For acquisition of microscope images , neurons were placed in re - covery buffer ( without dye ) and stimulated with stimulation buffer ( without dye ) . Fluorescence microscopy was performed on an UltraVIEW VoX ( Perkin Elmer ) spinning disk confocal unit , equipped with an Eclipse Ti inverted microscope ( Nikon ) , a C9100 - 50 emCCD camera ( Hamamatsu ) , and driven by Volocity software ( Improvision , Perkin Elmer ) . Images were acquired with a 60× oil immersion objective ( NA 1 . 4 ) as Z - stacks ( 0 . 3 μ m step ) . F1 stacks ( dye uptake ) were acquired while neurons were in the recovery buffer . F2 stacks ( after dye release ) were taken after 2 min from the application of the stimulation buffer . Images were analyzed using ImageJ software ( ImageJ 1 . 43u ) as follows : F1 and F2 Z - stacks were transformed in single images using the max intensity tool and subsequently concatenated .

Fluorescence intensity ( F1 and F2 ) of single punc - tuated signals was automatically calculated using a homemade macro . Electron microscopy and morphometry Conventional electron microscopy was carried out as previously described ( Polishchuk et al , 1999 ; Beznoussenko et al , 2007 ) . Hip - pocampal neuron cultures were directly ﬁ xed with 1 % glutaral - dehyde in 0 . 2 M Hepes ( pH 7 . 2 – 7 . 4 ) . The number of vesicles ( i . e . , synaptic vesicles , docked / tethered or vesicles larger than 80 nm ) was determined on electron micrographs with ImageJ software ( ImageJ 1 . 43u ) and a homemade ImageJ script . Synaptic vesicles were de ﬁ ned as the small homogenously sized vesicles ( ≤ 60 nm ) forming large clusters in the terminal . Docked / tethered vesicles were de ﬁ ned as small homogenously sized vesicles ( ≤ 60 nm ) within 25 nm from the active zone PM . For bulk steady - state en - docytosis , we measured vesicles larger than 80 nm in the terminal . For HRP uptake experiments , peroxidase from horseradish Type VI - A ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was used at concentration of 10 mg / ml . All buffers with inhibitors were the same as for the “ dye uptake ex - periments ” described above . Neurons were allowed to equilibrate for 90 s in the recovery buffer with HRP , and then stimulated for 90 s with the stimulation buffer with HRP . After four quick washes with the recovery buffer , the neurons were ﬁ xed with 2 . 5 % glutaralde - hyde / 0 . 1 M cacodylate , pH 7 . 4 . Images were analyzed using ImageJ software ( ImageJ 1 . 43u ) . The number of HRP - positive vesicleslarger than80 nm was automatically calculated using a homemade ImageJ Script . Statistical signi ﬁ cance was calculated by t test . Whole - mount staining of Eps15 / Eps15L1 - DKO embryos with anti - PECAM primary antibody Embryos were collected at 9 . 5 dpc and ﬁ xed overnight at 4°C in 100 % methanol . After ﬁ xation , the embryos were rehydrated and blocked overnight at 4°C in PBS containing 5 % donkey serum , 1 % BSA , and 0 . 5 % Triton - X 100 . After wash , they were incubated overnight at 4°C with anti - PECAM primary antibody ( kindly provided by E . Dejana ) in PBS containing 0 . 5 % BSA and 0 . 25 % Triton - X 100 . The primary antibody was revealed by VECTASTAIN ABC system ( Vec - torlabs ) , according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions , and images acquired under a Leica stereo microscope . Alternatively , PECAM was revealed by immuno ﬂ uorescence as follows : embryos were in - cubated with anti - rat Alexa 488 and TOPRO ( Thermo Fisher Sci - enti ﬁ c ) in PBS containing 0 . 5 % BSA and 0 . 25 % Triton - X 100 for 2 h at room temperature . The embryos were then washed , post - ﬁ xed in 4 % paraformaldehyde , and mounted with ProLong Gold . Images were taken with a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope . Isolation of MEFs MEFs were isolated from Eps15 ﬂ p / ﬂ p / Eps15L1 + / + / CreERT2 tg and Eps15 ﬂ p / ﬂ p / Eps15L1 − / − / CreERT2 tg embryo mice . Brie ﬂ y , pregnant mice were euthanized at 13 . 5 dpc by CO 2 asphyxia . The embryos were decapitated for genotyping and the internal organs removed . The embryos were then dissociated with a blade , transferred to 0 . 05 % trypsin plus 0 . 02 % EDTA solution , and incubated for 10 min at 37°C under agitation . After addition of 100 μ g / ml DNase I ( Roche ) , the embryos were incubated for further 10 min . Digestion was completed by passing embryonic tissues through an 18 - gauge needle . The cells were ﬁ nally isolated through a 70 - μ m cell strainer and plated in 10 - cm petri dishes . The cells were grown in Hepes buffered GlutaMAX - DMEM ( Gibco Invitrogen ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( HyClone ) , at 37°C and 9 % CO 2 . Radioactive internalization and saturation binding assay Radioactive internalization and saturation binding assay were performed as previously described ( Sigismund et al , 2005 ) . Ex - periments were performed on WT , Eps15L1 - KO , Eps15 - KO , and Eps15 / Eps15L1 - DKO MEFs . WT and Eps15 - KO ﬁ broblasts were derived from Eps15 ﬂ p / ﬂ p / Eps15L1 + / + / CreERT2 tg mice , after in vitro treat - ment with DMSO vehicle or 250 nM ( Z ) - 4 - hydroxytamoxifen ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , respectively . Eps15L1 - KO and Eps15 / Eps15L1 - DKO ﬁ broblasts were derived from Eps15 ﬂ p / ﬂ p / Eps15L1 − / − / CreERT2 tg mice , after in vitro treatment with DMSO vehicle or 250 nM ( Z ) - 4 - hydroxytamoxifen , re - spectively . At least three different preparations of cells were analyzed . Biochemical studies Dissection of the brains for immuno ﬂ uorescence and fractionation of the brains for Western blotting was performed as previously described ( Offenhauser et al , 2006 ) . Western blotting on whole tissue extracts and RBC lysates was performed as follows . Tissues ( isolated after sacri ﬁ ce of the mice by CO 2 asphyxia ) and peripheral RBCs ( collected as explained in the next section ) were washed in PBS and homogenized in a lysis buffer containing 50 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % glycerol , 1 % triton X - 100 , 1 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM EGTA , 1 mM PMSF , 10 mM sodium orthovanadate , 50 mM sodium ﬂ uoride , and protease inhibitor cocktail SetIII ( Calbiochem ) . The lysates were then clari ﬁ ed at 4°C by centrifugation at 120 , 000 g for 1 h ( for tissues ) or 10 , 000 g for 15 min ( for RBCs ) . Protein concentration was measured by BCA protein assay ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) , according to the manu - facturer ’ s instructions . Desired amounts of proteins were dissolved in Laemmli buffer ( ﬁ nal concentration : 2 % SDS , 50 mM Tris – HCl , pH 6 . 8 , 100 mM DTT , 10 % glycerol , and 0 . 001 % bromophenol blue ) , boiled for 5 min , separated by SDS – PAGE , and then transferred on nitrocellulose membranes . The membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5 % BSA or 5 % low - fat dry milk ( in TBS plus 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ) and then incubated overnight at 4°C with the primary antibody . After wash , the membranes were incubated with HRP - conjugated secondary antibody ( Cell Signaling ) for 1 h at room tempera - ture . The bound secondary antibody was revealed through chem - iluminescence by photographic ﬁ lms ( Amersham Hyper ﬁ lm ECL ) or under a ChemiDoc Imaging System , after incubation with ECL substrate . Quantitation of the blots was performed using ImageJ ( ImageJ 1 . 43u ) . The following primary antibodies were used : anti - α adaptin ( mouse monoclonal AP6 ; Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) , anti - clathrin heavy chain ( rabbit polyclonal # 4796 ; Cell Signaling ) , Organismal functions of EPS15 and EPS15L1 Milesi et al . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 26508 / lsa . 201800273 vol 2 | no 1 | e201800273 8 of 11 anti - dynamin1 / 2 ( mouse monoclonal # MABT188 ; EDM Millipore ) , homemade anti - EPS15 ( mouse monoclonal 3T3 ) , homemade anti - EPS15L1 ( rabbit polyclonal # 860 ) , anti - epsin - 1 ( mouse monoclonal ZZ3 , kindly provided by S .
