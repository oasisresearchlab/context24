MAL2 , an essential protein of the machinery for apical transcytosis , functions by shuttling in vesicular carriers between the apical zone and the cell periphery . We have iden - tiﬁed INF2 , an atypical formin with actin polymeriza - tion and depolymerization activities , which is a binding partner of MAL2 . MAL2 - positive vesicular carriers associate with short actin ﬁlaments during transcytosis in a process requiring INF2 . INF2 binds Cdc42 in a GTP - loaded - dependent manner . Cdc42 and INF2 regulate MAL2 dynamics and are necessary for apical transcytosis and the formation of lateral lumens in hepatoma HepG2 cells . INF2 and MAL2 are also essential for the formation of the central lumen in organotypic cultures of epithelial MDCK cells . Our results reveal a functional mechanism whereby Cdc42 , INF2 , and MAL2 are sequentially ordered in a pathway dedicated to the regulation of transcytosis and lumen formation . INTRODUCTION Epithelial cells organize into spherical or tubular structures with their apical surface facing a central lumen and the basolateral surface contacting adjacent cells and the extracellular matrix ( Bryant and Mostov , 2008 ) . Acquisition and maintenance of apical and basolateral polarity by epithelial cells is fundamental to the display of a central lumen . Cell polarity requires sorting of lipids and proteins and subsequent vectorial trafﬁc to their speciﬁc surface destinations ( Mellman and Nelson , 2008 ) . Proteins destined for the apical surface travel directly from the Golgi or indirectly by making a detour to the basolateral surface before becoming internalized and transported through the cell in specialized endosome carriers in a process known as transcytosis . Apical transport in epithelial cells relies on the use of these direct and indirect pathways to different degrees , depending on the type of tissue ( Rodriguez - Boulan et al . , 2005 ) . Hepatocytes are specialized epithelial cells that delimit a lumen structured into tiny channels , the bile canaliculi , which is used for bile drainage . Unlike columnar epithelial cells , whose luminal domain is located at the cell’s apex and forms a central lumen , the luminal domain of hepatocytes is present in the lateral surface and delimits a bile canaliculus . Lumen positioning is regulated by Par1 , which regulates the organization of the micro - tubule network ( Cohen et al . , 2004 ) . MAL2 is an integral mem - brane protein originally identiﬁed in a yeast two - hybrid screen by its interaction with tumor protein D52 ( Wilson et al . , 2001 ) , the founder member of a family of proteins frequently overex - pressed in breast carcinoma ( Boutros et al . , 2004 ) . MAL2 has proved to be an essential element of the machinery for basolat - eral - to - apical transcytosis in the HepG2 cell line ( de Marco et al . , 2002 ) , a model of the hepatic cell . At steady state , MAL2 predominantly distributes in a Rab11 + subapical endosome compartment in both HepG2 cells ( de Marco et al . , 2002 , 2006 ) and epithelial cells ( Marazuela et al . , 2004 ) . Soon after basolat - eral endocytosis of apical cargo , a fraction of MAL2 redistributes from the apical region into peripheral endosome elements to concentrate internalized cargo . These endosomes then progres - sively fuse and move toward the apical surface for cargo delivery ( de Marco et al . , 2006 ) . Formins are a widely expressed family of proteins that nucleate the formation of actin ﬁlaments . Unlike the actin - related protein 2 / 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) complex , which generates branched ﬁla - ments , formins form linear ﬁlaments ( Ridley , 2006 ) . The best - studied formins are the diaphanous - related formins ( Drfs ) , which are direct effectors of Rho - family GTPases ( Goode and Eck , 2007 ) . Drfs have at their carboxyl terminus an autoregulatory domain , known as the diaphanous autoregulatory domain ( DAD ) , which is separated by formin homology ( FH ) domains 1 - 2 from an amino - terminal diaphanous inhibitory domain ( DID ) . The DAD interacts with the DID to close the Drf molecule and maintains it in an inactive state . The binding of the effector Rho GTPase regulates Drf activity by opening up the Drf mole - cule ( Otomo et al . , 2005 ) . Drfs have been found to modulate a number of intracellular processes , such as endosome motility , microtubule stabilization , and cytokinesis ( Faix and Grosse , 2006 ) . 814 Developmental Cell 18 , 814 – 827 , May 18 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . To obtain insights into the mechanism of transcytosis , we have sought proteins that interact with MAL2 and have identiﬁed human in verted f ormin ( INF ) 2 , a formin organized in DID , FH1 - 2 , and DAD domains , which has the unique ability to accel - erate both actin polymerization and depolymerization ( Chhabra and Higgs , 2006 ) . The results presented in this work indicate the existence of a novel pathway by which Cdc42 controls apical transcytosis and correct lumen formation by regulating MAL2 dynamics through INF2 . RESULTS Identiﬁcation of Human INF2 as a MAL2 - Interacting Formin A yeast two - hybrid screen of a breast carcinoma cDNA expres - sion library was performed with a full - length MAL2 bait ( Fanayan et al . , 2009 ) . One of the cDNAs isolated , named 255C1 , corre - sponds to a partial cDNA encoding the 255 carboxy - terminal amino acids of the human INF2 - 1 formin ( see Figures S1A and S1B available online ) . Human INF2 - 1 consists of a 1249 residue sequence ( Figure S1B ) organized into DID , FH1 - 2 , DAD , and a carboxy - terminal ( C ) domain , as described for mouse INF2 - 1 ( Chhabra and Higgs , 2006 ) . The 255C1 INF2 - 1 prey reproducibly bound full - length MAL2 and deleted MAL2 baits lacking the N - terminal domain ( MAL2 D N ) or the N - terminal and the ﬁrst membrane - associated domains ( MAL2 D NTM1 ) , but did not detectably bind a deleted MAL2 bait additionally lacking the second membrane - associated domain ( MAL2 D NTM12 ) ( Fig - ure 1A ) . These results indicate that MAL2 residues S56 – F86 that include the second hydrophobic segment are required for INF2 - 1 binding in this assay . In addition to INF2 - 1 , whose C domain ends with a CIVQ sequence that in mouse INF2 - 1 is farnesylated ( Chhabra et al . , 2009 ) , a second INF2 cDNA was found to encode an isoform , INF2 - 2 , in which the last 18 amino acid sequence of the INF2 - 1 carboxyl terminus was substituted by a 9 amino acid sequence containing basic amino acids ( Figures S1A and S1B ) . The primary structure of human INF2 - 1 is 73 % identical to that of mouse INF2 - 1 ( Figure S1C ) . The great - est differences occur within the FH1 domain , which is shorter in human INF2 , and in the C domain . Phylogenetic analysis indi - cated that INF2 is more closely related to Drfs Dia 1 – 3 than to other formins ( Figure S1D ) . Northern blot analysis of different human tissues suggested that INF2 mRNA is ubiquitously ex - pressed ( Figure S1E ) . The antibodies generated to two INF2 peptides detected endogenous INF2 in a panel of human cell lines and in Madin - Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cells ( Figures S1F – S1H ) . Consistent with the results of yeast two - hybrid experiments , MAL2 bound to an INF2 - 1 fragment containing most of the C domain in pull - down experiments using a GST fusion ( Figure 1B ) . A similar result was obtained with the similar fragment of INF2 - 2 . The FH2DAD fragment , which contains the initial amino acids of the C domain , also bound MAL2 , although it did so to a lesser extent than did the GST - C fusions . Coimmunoprecipitation experiments conﬁrmed the association of INF2 and MAL2 ( Figure 1C ) . HepG2 cells polarize in vitro with their apical surface , forming intercellular lumens reminiscent of bona ﬁde bile canaliculi ( Sor - munen et al . , 1993 ) . The fact that polarized apical trafﬁcking in hepatic cells is simpler than in other model cell lines ( Bastaki et al . , 2002 ) led us to choose HepG2 cells for the functional study of INF2 . A small fraction of endogenous INF2 colocalized with MAL2 at the apical membrane of HepG2 cells , whereas the remaining INF2distributedthroughoutthecytoplasm ( Figure 1D ) . Exogenous INF2 - 1 and INF2 - 2 reproduced the presence of endogenous INF2 at the apical membrane ( Figure 1E ) , INF2 - 1 being mostly distributed in the endoplasmic reticulum , as described for mouse INF2 - 1 ( Chhabra et al . , 2009 ) . Although a high level of colocalization between INF2 and calnexin was observed at the endoplasmic reticulum , calnexin was nearly depleted at the canalicular zone whereas INF2 was still present ( Figures S1I and S1J ) . In keeping with its interaction with MAL2 , the C domain of INF2 - 1 and INF2 - 2 continued to target to the apical region , as observed for the entire molecule ( Figure 1F ) . Therefore , the C domain is the main determinant of the interaction of INF2 with MAL2 and the targeting of INF2 to the apical zone . INF2 Silencing Impairs Lumen Formation , MAL2 Targeting to the Apical Surface , and Basolateral - to - Apical Transcytosis To investigate the possible role of INF2 in MAL2 localization and function , we used a loss - of - function strategy by employing speciﬁc siRNA1 ( si1 ) or siRNA2 ( si2 ) targeted to the 3 0 untrans - lated or coding regions of human INF2 mRNA , respectively . Expression of si1 or si2 reduced the levels of endogenous INF2 to approximately 7 % or 15 % , respectively , of the INF2 content of control siRNA ( siC ) - transfected cells ( Figures 2A and 2B ) . INF2 silencing greatly diminished the number of intercellular lumens ( Figure 2C ) , decreased the size of the remaining lumens ( Figure 2D ) , and caused a reduction in the levels of MAL2 at the apical zone in these lumens ( Figures 2E and 2F ) . The loss of MAL2 from the apical zone was compensated for by its increased presence in scattered vesicular structures ( Figure 2F ) . MAL2 was previously shown to be essential for efﬁcient trans - cytosis to the apical surface of both the polymeric immunoglob - ulin receptor and CD59 , which are attached to the membrane byasingleanchor , atransmembranespanoraglycosylphospha - tidylinositol moiety , respectively ( de Marco et al . , 2002 ) . As INF2 depletion affects the apical distribution of MAL2 , we investigated whether transcytosis takes place in the absence of INF2 expres - sion by analyzing the transport of CD59 to the luminal surface . Whereas approximately 75 % of the intercellular lumens were scored as positive for transcytosed CD59 in siC - treated cells after 90 min of transcytosis , the percentage dropped to 35 % – 40 % in the remaining lumens of INF2 - silenced cells ( Figure 2G ; Figure S2A ) . Moreover , the levels of transcytosed CD59 were greatly diminished in INF2 - silenced cells even in the lumens scored as positive for CD59 transcytosis ( Figure 2H ) . The inter - nalized CD59 in INF2 - depleted cells accumulated in endosome structures distant from the apical membrane ( Figure S2B ) , similar to the pattern observed in MAL2 - silenced cells ( de Marco et al . , 2002 ) . The number and size of the lumens , the levels of apical MAL2 , and the access of CD59 to the apical membrane were closely associated with INF2 expression , as conﬁrmed in HepG2 cells expressing intact INF2 - 2 proteins designed to be resistant ( HepG / R1 cells ) or sensitive ( HepG / S1 cells ) to expres - sion of si1 but sensitive to si2 expression ( Figure 2 ; Figure S2C ) . Developmental Cell INF2 Mediates Transcytosis and Lumen Formation Developmental Cell 18 , 814 – 827 , May 18 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . 815 The exogenous expression of mDia1 ( Figure S2D ) was unable to correct the defects observed in lumen formation in INF2 - silenced cells ( Figure 2C ) , conﬁrming the speciﬁc requirement of INF2 . These results indicate that INF2 is required for lumen formation and efﬁcient transcytosis to the apical membrane of HepG2 cells . INF2 Silencing Impairs the Translocation of Apical MAL2 to Encounter Internalized Cargo MAL2 mediates transcytosis by emitting vesicles and tubular extensions from the apical region to encounter internalized cargo dispersed at the basolateral periphery ( de Marco et al . , 2006 ) . To investigate whether INF2 is required for MAL2 redistribution , we compared the dynamics of MAL2 in normal and INF2 - silenced cells during CD59 transcytosis in HepG2 cells stably expressing GFP - MAL2 ( HepG2 / GFP - MAL2 ) . MAL2 was initially detected solely in the luminal area in normal and INF2 - silenced cells but , whereas emission of MAL2 tubules and vesicles to the cell interior took place by maturation of buds , in INF2 - silenced cells buds formed but did not detach efﬁciently ( Figures 3A and 3B ; Movie S1 ) .

Yeast growth on solid media at 30 (cid:2) C was evaluated as follows : – , no growth after 6 – 8 days ; + or + + , growth after 5 - 6 or 3 - 4 days , respectively . Interactions between full - length MAL2 and D52 - like prey proteins were employed as controls .

Figure 3C shows a MAL2 - positive bud arising from the apical zone that is sur - rounded by F - actin at the site of bud attachment ( box 1 ) , a MAL2 - positive element with a short actin comet encountering a vesicle loaded with internalized CD59 in the middle of the cell ( box 2 ) , and a MAL2 - positive proﬁle emitting extensions to contact a vesicle with internalized CD59 at the cell periphery ( box 3 ) . Figures 3D and 3E show a MAL2 - positive apical bud associated with INF2 and F - actin and a peripheral MAL2 - posi - tive transport vesicle with INF2 and an associated actin comet , respectively . It is of particular note that silencing of INF2 greatly reduced the number of cytoplasmic MAL2 - positive vesicular elements associated with actin comets ( Figure 3F ) . Therefore , INF2 is required for the formation of actin comets that allow the emission of MAL2 - positive elements from the apical membrane and their movement to encounter basolaterally inter - nalized cargo ( Figure 3G ) . INF2 Function in Transcytosis Is Lost by Mutation of Critical Residues Involved in Actin Polymerization or Depolymerization Mutation of three critical leucine residues ( Leu1010 , Leu1011 , Leu1020 ) to alanine in the DAD of mouse INF2 abrogates the in vitro depolymerization but not the polymerization activity of INF2 ( Chhabra and Higgs , 2006 ) . Substitution of Lys1601 in the FH2 domain of yeast formin Bni1p and of the corresponding lysine residue of mDia2 ( Lys853 ) by alanine abolishes the actin nucleation activity of these formins ( Bartolini et al . , 2008 ; Xu et al . , 2004 ) . As all these residues are conserved in human INF2 ( Figure 4A ) , we introduced the same replacements at the equivalent positions of human INF2 - 2 ( Lys792 and Leu976 , Leu977 and Leu986 ) to express INF2 proteins ( INF2 - K / A and INF2 - 3L / A ) with these mutations . As transient overexpression of INF2 - 3L / A was toxic to the cells , we prepared stable transfec - tants , whereas in the case of INF2 - K / A we used transient expres - sion . We then examined whether INF2 - 3L / A or INF2 - K / A , which were designed to resist si1 but not si2 expression , as actually occurred ( Figure 4A ) , can functionally replace endogenous INF2 in si1 - transfected cells as intact INF2 - 2 did ( Figure 2 ) . The stable expression of INF2 - 3L / A produced a 40 % reduction in the number of intercellular lumens relative to normal HepG2 cells ( Figure 4B ) . Silencing the endogenous protein alone with si1 in HepG2 INF2 - 3L / A cells caused an additional 20 % decrease , and knockdown of both the endogenous and the exogenous protein with si2 produced a further 8 % drop ( Figure 4B ) . The failure of INF2 - 3L / A to replace endogenous INF2 in lumen forma - tion parallels its ineffectiveness in mediating CD59 transcytosis ( Figures 4C – 4E ) and is correlated with a signiﬁcant reduction in the number of cytoplasmic MAL2 - positive vesicles associated with actin comets ( Figure 4F ) . Similarly , the INF2 - K / A mutant was also unable to replace endogenous INF2 in lumen formation , apical transcytosis , and association of actin comets to MAL2 - positive vesicles , although the effects of INF2 - K / A were milder than those of the INF2 - 3L / A mutant ( Figures 4B – 4F ) . Thus , INF2 requires its actin depolymerization activity and an intact FH2 domain to mediate normal lumen formation and efﬁcient transcytosis in HepG2 cells . Next , we carried out gain - of - function experiments by express - ing D DID and D DID D C INF2 - 2 proteins lacking the DID domain , which is required for closing Drfs in an inactive state . Expression of both mutants in HepG2 cells ( Figure 4G ) induced formation of long longitudinal actin stress ﬁbers ( Figure S3A ) , alignment of microtubules along the actin ﬁbers ( Figure S3A ) , cell depolariza - tion ( Figure S3B ) , and development of long ﬁlopodial structures ( Figures 4H – 4J ; Figures S3A – S3C ) . Filopodia induced by the mutants were often long , up to 6 – 8 m m ( Figure 4H ) , and were not attached to the substratum , resembling those induced by an mDia2 mutant with a similar N - terminal deletion ( Yang et al . , 2007 ) . Cell depolarization and formation of long ﬁlopodia were also induced by the two INF2 - 2 deletion mutants in MDCK cells ( Figures S3D – S3G ) . Both mutants were detected at the tip of most of the ﬁlopodium processes present in transfected HepG2 cells ( Figure 4I , left histogram ; Figure 4J ) . It is of particular note that the distribution of MAL2 in these cells was affected differently by the mutants . D DID INF2 - 2 , which keeps the MAL2 - interacting C region intact , induced the recruitment of MAL2 to the F - actin tips at the cell edges , where MAL2 and the D DID mutant colocalized , whereas D DID D C INF2 - 2 , which lacks the MAL2 - interacting C region , did not target MAL2 to the F - actin tips ( Figure 4I , right histogram ; Figure 4J ) . As a control , we observed that expression of intact INF2 - 2 did not alter the perinuclear MAL2 distribution found in the unpolarized population of HepG2 cells ( Figure 4J ) . The results in Figures 4H – 4J provide an extreme case showing that the intracellular distribution of MAL2 is governed by INF2 through the formation of actin ﬁlaments and its physical interaction with MAL2 . Cdc42 Binds INF2 and Regulates Lumen Formation , MAL2 Dynamics , and Apical Transcytosis To investigate the binding of Rho GTPases to the DID of INF2 , we performed pull - down assays ( Figure 5A ) . Cdc42 bound to the INF2 fragment exclusively in its GTP - loaded form , whereas Rac1 binding occurred regardless of its state of loading , although to different extents . No binding of RhoA was observed in either case , consistent with the fact that INF2 lacks an exten - sion N - terminal to the DID ( Chhabra et al . , 2009 ) that is present in the RhoA - regulated Drfs mDia1 - 2 and that in mDia1 is involved in RhoA binding ( Otomo et al . , 2005 ) . The silencing of Cdc42 basi - cally reproduced the effects of INF2 silencing with regard to the number of lumens , the percentage of remaining lumens with transcytosed CD59 , and the levels of transcytosed CD59 in these lumens ( Figures 5B – 5F ) . In contrast , RhoA and Rac1 silencing did not affect the number of lumens or the percentage of lumens with transcytosed CD59 ( Figures 5B – 5F ) and pro - duced only mild effects on the luminal levels of transcytosed CD59 ( Figure 5E ) . Therefore , Cdc42 appears to be the Rho - GT - Pase regulator of INF2 for the processes of lumen formation and apical transcytosis , although we cannot rule out a role for Rac1 as an INF2 regulator in other cellular processes . It is of particular note that a fraction of active Cdc42 mutant ( Cdc42L61 ) was distributed at the apical membrane where it colocalized with MAL2 , the remainder being distributed throughout the cytosol ( Figure 6A ) . In accordance with the results from Cdc42 - silenced cells , overexpression of a domi - nant - negative form of Cdc42 ( Cdc42N17 ) in HepG2 cells dramatically reduced the number of lumens , whereas the active mutant had the opposite effect ( Figure 6B ) . Moreover , Cdc42L61 accelerated CD59 transcytosis in such a way that , Developmental Cell INF2 Mediates Transcytosis and Lumen Formation Developmental Cell 18 , 814 – 827 , May 18 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . 819 A siC si2 si1 - - - AA - - - - - - - - A - - 3L / A siC mINF2 hINF2 3L / A α Tub 1007 IDALLADIRKGFQLRK 1022 973 IDALLADIRKGFQLRK 988 150 50 G Δ DID Δ DID Δ C GFP - MAL2 / INF2 / F - actin F - actin Δ DID Δ DID Δ C FH2 FH1 D 266 FH1 FH2 D 1240 266 1012 B C E * * * Δ DID Δ DID Δ C % M A L2 - a c t i n t i p s / c e ll + % I N F 2 - a c t i n t i p s / c e ll + 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 20 40 60 80 100 J H 0 10 20 30 40 50 Δ DID Δ DID Δ C Control INF2 - 2 N u m be r o f l u m en s GFP - MAL2 INF2 E ndog .

Developmental Cell INF2 Mediates Transcytosis and Lumen Formation 820 Developmental Cell 18 , 814 – 827 , May 18 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . after 30 min at 37 (cid:2) C , approximately 42 % of the lumens formed already contained transcytosed CD59 , in contrast to only 7 % in the GFP - transfected control ( Figure 6C ) . Importantly , the increased rate of transcytosis promoted by Cdc42L61 was accompanied by increased dynamics of MAL2 , as revealed by experiments in which the recovery of apical GFP - MAL2 ﬂuores - cence at the expense of the cytoplasmic pool was measured ( Figure 6D ) . Providing further evidence of a role for Cdc42 and INF2 in the regulation of MAL2 function in transcytosis , MAL2 dynamics in normal cells were reduced by Cdc42 or INF2 silencing ( Figure 6D ) . Moreover , consistent with a role of INF2 and MAL2 downstream of Cdc42 , silencing of INF2 or MAL2 ( Figure 6E ) greatly decreased the number of lumens and the enhanced rate of transcytosis observed in Cdc42L61 - ex - pressing cells ( Figures 6F and 6G ) . The knockdown of either INF2 or MAL2 caused a modest decrease in the levels of endog - enous GTP - loaded Cdc42 but not in the total levels of the protein ( Figure 6H ) . This effect is probably due to the existence of autoregulatory feedback loops between cell polarization and Cdc42 activity as described in MDCK cells ( Martin - Belmonte et al . , 2007 ) . It is of note that the effect of MAL2 or INF2 depletion on lumen formation and apical transcytosis is not due to the observed reduction in Cdc42 activity , as the expression of active Cdc42L61 in cells knocked down for MAL2 or INF2 did not correct the defects ( Figures 6F and 6G ) . Therefore , the conclu - sion from Figures 5 and 6 is that Cdc42 regulates apical transcy - tosis in HepG2 cells by controlling MAL2 dynamics through INF2 ( Figure 6I ) . Given the role of INF2 and MAL2 in transcytosis and lumen formation in HepG2 cells , we investigated the involvement of these two proteins in the formation of the central lumen in MDCK cells . MAL2 colocalized with an apical pool of Cdc42 in cysts of MDCK cells ( Figure 7A ) . Silencing of endogenous MAL2 ( Figure 7B ) greatly inhibited the formation of central lumens in normal MDCK cells ( Figures 7C and 7D ) and , instead , multiple intercellular and intracellular lumens appeared ( Fig - ure 7D ) . Normal formation of central lumens was observed in MDCK cells stably expressing human MAL2 , which is insensitive to the siRNA used to deplete the endogenous canine protein ( Figures 7B – 7D ) . INF2 silencing in MDCK cells ( Figure 7E ) basi - cally reproduced the effect of MAL2 silencing , with a dramatic drop in the formation of central lumens and the appearance of multiple inter - and intracellular lumens ( Figures 7F and 7G ) . Thus , both INF2 and MAL2 are required for the formation of the central lumen in MDCK cell cysts . DISCUSSION The integral membrane MAL2 protein was characterized as an essential component of the vesicular machinery for apical trans - cytosis ( de Marco et al . , 2002 ) . In an attempt to understand how transcytotic vesicular trafﬁc is regulated , we sought MAL2 - inter - acting proteins and found INF2 , a formin of unknown function ( Chhabra and Higgs , 2006 ) that is a binding partner of MAL2 . The interaction involved the carboxy - terminal ( C ) region of INF2 , which is not conserved in other formins . At the opposite end of the molecule , the DID of INF2 interacted with Cdc42 and Rac1 but not RhoA . Consistent with their physical interac - tion , MAL2 colocalized with a fraction of Cdc42 and INF2 at the apical region of HepG2 cells . A combination of loss - and gain - of - function experiments revealed a novel pathway by which Cdc42 binds to INF2 , which , in turn , regulates MAL2 dynamics and , thereby , transcytotic transport to the apical membrane . The functioning of this pathway is essential for correct lumen formation in HepG2 cells and organotypic cultures of MDCK cells . MAL2 fulﬁls its transcytotic function by shuttling in tubulove - sicular structures between the apical zone , which constitutes its main site of residence , and the cell periphery , where it encounters internalized cargo that is subsequently ferried in MAL2 - positive transcytotic carriers destined for the apical surface ( de Marco et al . , 2006 ) . In the case of the apical MUC1 cargo glycoprotein , a direct interaction with MAL2 has recently been described ( Fanayan et al . , 2009 ) . We observed that silencing of either Cdc42 or INF2 in HepG2 cells slowed down MAL2 dynamics and greatly diminished the progression of cargo toward the apical membrane without affecting its internalization .

Our results are in agreement with previous ﬁndings showing the requirement of actin ﬁla - ments in postendocytic trafﬁc of cargo prior to the nocodazole - sensitive step ( Maples et al . , 1997 ) and are evidence of collaboration between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons in apical transcytosis . Although speculative at this stage , the observation that , in addition to its location at the apical zone , INF2 is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum raises the possibility of an involve - ment of the endoplasmic reticulum in apical transcytosis or other transport processes .

In vitro elongation of actin ﬁlaments between an immobilized formin and a second anchor point produces buckled ﬁlaments as short as 0 . 7 m m , demonstrating that actin polymerization produces forces > 1 pN ( Kovar and Pollard , 2004 ; Kozlov and Bershadsky , 2004 ) . We have visualized comets formed by short actin ﬁla - ments decorated with INF2 at their growing end that appear to push different types of MAL2 - positive elements . These actin comets were practically absent in INF2 - silenced cells . It is worth noting that the expression of the deregulated D DID mutant , which contains the C - terminal domain responsible for the inter - action of INF2 with MAL2 , but not a similar mutant without this domain , resulted in MAL2 targeting to the tips of the INF2 - induced actin stress ﬁbers , where it colocalizes with the deregulated INF2 protein . We therefore propose that assembly and disassembly of short actin ﬁlaments by INF2 provide force for propelling MAL2 - positive vesicle movement to encounter internalized cargo . Formins mDia3 ( hDia2C ) and the couple mDia1 and mDia2 as effectors of RhoD and RhoB , respectively , show the potential to modulate endosome trafﬁcking ( Fernandez - Borja et al . , 2005 ; Gasman et al . , 2003 ; Wallar et al . , 2007 ) . It has been proposed that the physiological role of these Drfs is to allow endosome movement by participating in continuous polymerization - depo - lymerization cycles of actin ﬁlaments ( Wallar et al . , 2007 ) . The formin - family Diaphanous Dia1 is required for apical secretion in epithelial tubes of the Drosophila embryo ( Massarwa et al . , 2009 ) . Obviously , mDia1 – 3 would be responsible for F - actin assembly , but disassembly would require the participation of additional proteins with severing and depolymerizing activities . The participation of such proteins does not appear to be exclu - sive to the movement of endosomes because coﬁlin , an actin - severing protein , has recently been implicated in the regulation of a population of actin ﬁlaments involved in transport of p75 through the direct route from the Golgi ( Salvarezza et al . , 2009 ) . A distinctive feature of INF2 , compared with the afore - mentioned Drfs , is its in vitro capacity both to nucleate and depo - lymerize actin ﬁlaments ( Chhabra and Higgs , 2006 ) . Therefore , unlike other formins that would require machinery for disas - sembly of actin ﬁlaments , it appears that INF2 could do the entire job . Consistent with the requirement for actin assembly and disassembly in INF2 function in transcytosis , we found that INF2 proteins with mutations that abrogate the actin depolymer - ization activity of INF2 or the actin polymerization activity of other formins were unable to reconstitute transcytosis in cells with depleted levels of endogenous INF2 , whereas this was success - fully achieved by intact INF2 . Unlike HepG2 cells that form lateral lumens , MDCK cells grown in three - dimensional cultures orient their apical surface to assemble a central lumen . A current model of control of epithelial morphogenesis proposes that Cdc42 is recruited to the apical surface by annexin 2 , which , in turn , is recruited by PTEN - mediated apical segregation of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Once at the apical membrane , Cdc42 can recruit Par6 , a member of the Par3 / Par6 / aPKC complex , which controls apical membrane formation ( Martin - Belmonte et al . , 2007 ) . Cdc42 silencing impairs the formation of the central lumen in MDCK cysts and , instead , multiple intracellular and intercellular lumens are formed ( Martin - Belmonte et al . , 2007 ) . Silencing of INF2 or MAL2 in MDCK cells recapitulated the effect of Cdc42 silencing on lumen formation . In contrast , we did not observe formation of intracel - lular or intercellular lumens in HepG2 cells with silenced levels of Cdc42 , INF2 , or MAL2 . An important difference between HepG2 and MDCK cells is that apical transport of proteins attached to the membrane by a single anchor exclusively relies on the trans - cytotic pathway in HepG2 cells , whereas direct routes coexist with the transcytotic pathway in MDCK cells . Therefore , in the absence of apical transcytosis , MDCK cells can still use the direct route for apical targeting and form intracellular or intercel - lular lumens , whereas this process is not possible in HepG2 cells . INF2 mutations have recently been implicated in an auto - somal - dominant form of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( Brown et al . , 2010 ) , a kidney disease characterized by dysregu - lation of podocyte function and alterations in the podocyte cyto - skeleton . As INF2 is ubiquitously expressed , our results on INF2 function could be useful for understanding the role of INF2 in other cell types under normal or pathological conditions . In summary , our ﬁndings suggest that , in addition to acting in other pathways crucial for correct lumen formation ( Georgiou et al . , 2008 ; Jaffe et al . , 2008 ; Martin - Belmonte et al . , 2007 ) , Cdc42 governs a novel pathway dedicated to the regulation of apical transcytosis by which Cdc42 controls INF2 , which , in turn , regu - lates MAL2 dynamics through the formation of actin comets that promote the formation of MAL2 - positive elements and appear to propel their movement . This process is essential for correct lumen formation in HepG2 and MDCK cells . The distributions of CD59 and F - actin after 10 and 30 min of transcytosis are shown ( C , right panels ) .

ThesequenceofthesiRNAhetero - duplexes and the transfection conditions used are detailed in Supplemental Experimental Procedures . Confocal Microscopic Analysis TheprocedureforcellimmunolabelingisdetailedinSupplementalInformation . Images were obtained by confocal microscopy using an LSM510 META system ( Carl Zeiss ) coupled to an inverted Axiovert 200 microscope . For each sample , medial optical slices of 50 different polarized cells were recorded . HepG2 intercellular lumens ( bile canaliculi ) were visualized on phase - contrast acquisitions and by F - actin staining . We used Huygens 3 . 0 software ( Scientiﬁc Volume Imaging ) for deconvolution and ImageJ ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij ) for colocalization graphics . NIH Image software was used to quantify the intensity of ﬂuorescence ( mean intensity of ﬂuorescence per pixel ) . Images were exported in TIFF format , and their brightness and contrast were optimized with Adobe Photoshop . Transcytosis Assay HepG2 cells were incubated with mouse mAb to CD59 at 4 (cid:2) C for 30 min . After extensive washes , cells were incubated at 37 (cid:2) C for different times in normal medium . Ateachtime , thecellswerewashed , ﬁxed , andanalyzedbyimmuno - ﬂuorescence microscopy with ﬂuorescent anti - mouse IgG secondary anti - bodies ( Invitrogen ) . Lumens were scored as positive for transcytosed CD59 when the intensity of CD59 staining was greater than the mean at 0 min + 1 . 5 3 SEM . Time - Lapse Videomicroscopic Analysis and FRAP Assays Time - lapse videomicroscopy of the transcytosis process was as previously described ( de Marco et al . , 2006 ) . Cell images were captured at 15 min inter - vals . Images were analyzed with MetaMorph imaging software ( Molecular Devices ) . FRAP analysis was done with an inverted confocal laser LSM710 scanning microscope ( Carl Zeiss ) . Pull - Down and Coimmunoprecipitation Analyses Forpull - downexperiments , HepG2celllysateswereincubatedat4 (cid:2) Cinassay buffer with 10 m g of GST proteins immobilized on GSH - Sepharose beads ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) . For coimmunoprecipitation analysis , lysates were precleared with a control antibody bound to protein G Sepharose and then incubated overnight at 4 (cid:2) C with anti - MAL2 antibody complexed to protein G Sepharose . Sepharose beads were extensively washed and bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting . Please refer to Supplemental Information for further details .
