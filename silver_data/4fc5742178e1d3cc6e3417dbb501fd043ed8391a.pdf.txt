E - mail : r . khalil @ lumc . nl Abstract Dynamin plays an essential role in maintaining the structure and function of the glomerular filtration barrier . Specifically , dynamin regulates the actin cytoskeleton and the turnover of nephrin in podocytes , and knocking down dynamin expression causes proteinuria . Moreover , promoting dynamin oligomerization with Bis - T - 23 restores podocyte function and reduces proteinuria in several animal models of chronic kidney disease . Thus , dynamin is a promising therapeutic target for treating chronic kidney disease . Here , we investigated the pathophysiological role of dynamin under proteinuric circumstances in a rat model and in humans . We found that glomerular Dnm2 and Dnm1mRNA levels are increased prior to the onset of proteinuria in a rat model of spontaneous proteinuria . Also , in zebrafish embryos , we confirm that knocking down dynamin translation results in proteinuria . Finally , we show that the glomerular expression of dynamin and cathepsin L protein is increased in several human proteinuric kidney diseases . We propose that the increased expression of glomerular dynamin reflects an exhausted attempt to maintain and / or restore integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier . These results confirm that dynamin plays an important role in maintaining the glomerular filtration barrier , and they support the notion that dynamin is a promising therapeutic target in proteinuric kidney disease . © 2018 The Authors .

Introduction Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) is a major health issue worldwide [ 1 ] . The progression of CKD is accompanied by a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate and sub - sequent proteinuria . In order to develop new therapeutic strategies for CKD , it is important to understand the mechanisms and processes that underlie glomerular fil - tration . The glomerular filtration barrier ( GFB ) consists of several components , including the interdigitating foot processes of podocytes , the glomerular basement mem - brane , and a glycocalyx - covered fenestrated endothe - lium . Disrupting the GFB allows the passage of proteins into the urinary space . Under normal conditions , these proteins are then reabsorbed by proximal tubular epithe - lial cells ; however , if the reabsorption mechanism is impaired or saturated , proteinuria can develop . Dynamin is a recently identified protein that plays an important role in maintaining GFB integrity . This 96 kDa GTPase is expressed both in glomerular podocytes and in tubular epithelial cells [ 2 , 3 ] . Within the GFB , dynamin has three identified functions : ( 1 ) dynamin is involved in the turnover of nephrin [ 4 ] ; ( 2 ) it interacts directly with actin and actin - regulatory proteins [ 5 ] ; and ( 3 ) it is involved in the endocytosis of albumin by podocytes [ 6 ] . Several groups have reported that loss of dynamin using a genetic knockdown model or via cleavage with the endopeptidase cathepsin L results in proteinuria [ 3 , 4 , 7 ] . Moreover , Schiffer et al demonstrated that dynamin is a potential therapeutic target in CKD [ 7 ] . Specifically , the authors reported beneficial effects of treating several animal models of proteinuria with Bis - T - 23 , a small molecule compound that stimulates the oligomerization of dynamin to form a 72 - subunit helical structure [ 8 ] . Importantly , Schiffer et al found that administering Bis - T - 23 restored the ultrastructure of podocyte foot processes , decreased proteinuria , lowered mesangial collagen IV deposition , © 2018 The Authors .

Ono et al also showed that Bis - T - 23 treatment prevented albuminuria and attenuated alter - ations in foot process formation in an experimental mouse model [ 9 ] . Although these studies indicate that dynamin plays an important role in maintaining GFB structure and function , the majority of this research relied on the observation of morphological and / or functional changes in the kidney after genetic manip - ulation or other alterations in dynamin . Thus , intrinsic changes in dynamin expression under proteinuric con - ditions have not been investigated in animal models or patients . Here , we report that dynamin expression is increased in proteinuric conditions . We show that glomerular Dnm2 and Dnm1 mRNA levels are increased in a rat model of spontaneous proteinuria prior to the onset of proteinuria . We also show that knocking down dynamin translation in a zebrafish embryo model results in proteinuria . Lastly , we show that glomerular dynamin and cathepsin L protein levels are increased in human patients with proteinuric kidney disease . Materials and methods Microarray analysis We analyzed microarray datasets of Dahl and SHR rats in order to identify differentially regulated cytoskeleton - related genes . The datasets were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus of the NCBI , which is accessible using the GEO Series accession number GSE 13810 . This analysis was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip Rat Genome 230 2 . 0 arrays ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) . Path - way analysis was performed using the Gene Ontology Tree Machine ( Oak Ridge National Laboratory , Oak Ridge , TN , USA ) and by global testing in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( Kanehisa Lab - oratories , Kyoto , Japan ) in order to determine which differentially regulated genes are involved in cytoskele - tal regulation [ 10 , 11 ] . This microarray was performed on glomeruli obtained from animals at 4 and 6 weeks of age ( Table 1 ) . The micro array data analyzed in this study have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE 13810 ( https : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / geo / query / acc . cgi ? acc = GSE13810 ) . Animal studies : rats The rat experiments were approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee for Animal Care and Experi - mentation . Male spontaneously proteinuric Dahl salt - sensitive rats ( Dahl ) and non - proteinuric spon - taneously hypertensive rats ( SHR ) were obtained from the Charité - University Medicine Berlin [ 12 ] . To prevent the early accelerated development of severe hypertension , the rats were fed a low - salt diet containing 0 . 2 % NaCl by weight content . Tissues were collected from animals at 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 weeks of age . A total of 67 animals were used , with respectively seven , seven , seven , eight , and eight Dahl rats per age group and five , four , six , seven , and eight SHR rats per age group . In each animal , the left kidney was used to isolate the glomeruli using magnetic retraction ; these samples were used for mRNA analysis [ 13 ] . The right kidney of each animal was extracted ; part was embedded in paraffin wax , and another part was snap - frozen and stored − 80 ∘ C . RNA isolation , reverse transcription , and qPCR RNA was isolated from rat glomeruli using TRIzol ( Invitrogen , Waltham , MA , USA ) . AMV reverse tran - scriptase ( Roche Diagnostics , Risch - Rotkreuz , Switzer - land ) was used to reverse - transcribe the RNA into first - strand cDNA , which was then analyzed using qPCR with the primer pairs listed in Table 2 . Hprt1 was used as an internal control . qPCR was performed on an iCycler real - time PCR machine with SYBR Green Supermix ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA , USA ) , and iCy - cler IQ 3 . 1 software ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) was used to analyze gene expression and to normalize the data . Dnm1 and Dnm2 mRNA levels are shown as relative to the average Dnm1 or Dnm2 mRNA expression in SHR rats . Animal studies : zebrafish All zebrafish experiments were performed prior to the free - feeding embryo stage and are therefore not consid - ered animal experiments in accordance with the EU Ani - mal Protection Directive 2010 / 63 / EU . Wild - type ( WT ) AB / TL strain zebrafish ( Danio rerio H ) were main - tained using previously defined standards [ 14 ] . Embryos were obtained through natural crossings and kept in E3 medium at 28 . 5 ∘ C . In the one - to four - cell stage , the embryos were injected with 1 nl of a morpholino ( Gene Tools , Philomath , OR , USA ) targeting the dnm2 gene ( to knockdown mRNA translation ) or a scrambled control morpholino [ 15 ] . Glomerular permeability and tubular reabsorption assay A previously validated tubular dextran reabsorp - tion model was used to assess glomerular per - meability in zebrafish embryos [ 16 , 17 ] . At 4 days post - fertilization ( dpf ) , a group of WT embryos were injected with 3 nl of puromycin aminonucleoside ( PAN , 25 mg / ml ; Sigma - Aldrich , St Louis , MO , USA ) to induce kidney damage as a positive control for pro - teinuria [ 17 ] . At 5 dpf , all groups were injected with 3 nl of a mixture of TRITC - labeled 3 kDa dextran ( 100 mg / ml ; Invitrogen ) and FITC - labeled 70 - kDa dex - tran ( 25 mg / ml ; Invitrogen ) . One hour after injection , the animals were fixed in 10 % formalin for 24 h . After subsequent storage in 70 % ethanol , the embryos were © 2018 The Authors .

The number of reabsorption droplets in the proximal tubule cells was counted and compared between groups . The 3 kDa dextran tracer freely passes the GFB and is subse - quently reabsorbed by the proximal tubule epithelial cells . Therefore , reabsorption of this tracer is used as an indicator of sufficient tubular reabsorption function . In contrast , the 70 kDa tracer does not readily pass the GFB under normal conditions and is therefore used as an indicator of glomerular permeability [ 16 ] .

Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 3 . All tissue samples were obtained and handled in accordance with institutional guidelines and with the Code of Conduct regarding the responsible use of human tissues [ 18 ] . Immunohistochemistry The mouse anti - dynamin antibody Hudy 1 ( Upstate Biotechnology , Lake Placid , NY , USA ; catalog number 05 - 319 , diluted 1 : 80 ) was used to detect dynamin . Hudy 1 is a monoclonal antibody that recognizes both dynamin 1 and dynamin 2 . Hudy 1 recognizes the epitope of residues 822 – 838 within the proline - rich domain of dynamin . Anti - mouse Envision ( Dako Cyto - motion , Glostrup , Denmark ) was used as a secondary antibody to detect the primary antibody . A rabbit anti - cathepsin L antibody ( Abcam , Cambridge , UK ; ab203028 , diluted 1 : 100 ) was used to detect cathepsin L . The results were analyzed by measuring the percent positive area in the glomeruli using the ImageJ digital image analysis program . No scarred glomeruli were included in these analyses . Statistical analyses Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 23 . 0 ( IBM Corp , Armonk , NY , USA ) . Levels of mRNA and protein were compared using one - way ANOVA ( with Dunnett’s post hoc analysis when more than three groups were compared ) . Student’s unpaired t - test was used when two or three groups were compared . Corre - lation analysis was performed using the Pearson corre - lation coefficient . Differences with a P value less than 0 . 05 were considered significant . Results Gene expression profiling between Dahl and SHR rats First , we investigated differences in the gene expression between Dahl rats and SHR rats using microarray analysis . With respect to cytoskeleton - related genes , we found 28 genes that were differentially regulated between Dahl rats and SHR rats ( Table 1 ) . Of these 28 genes , 26 were significantly upregulated ( includ - ing Dnm1 ) , and two genes ( Spna1 and Pmfbp1 ) were downregulated . Glomerular Dnm1 and Dnm2 mRNA – but not dynamin protein area expression – are increased in Dahl rats prior to the onset of proteinuria Next , we measured glomerular dynamin expression in the Dahl salt - sensitive spontaneously proteinuric and hypertensive rat model ( referred to here as sim - ply Dahl rats ) and the spontaneously hypertensive rat ( SHR ) . Dahl rats under a low dietary salt intake developed significant proteinuria beginning at 6 weeks of age ; in contrast , SHR rats did not develop proteinuria , even at 10 weeks of age ( Figure 1A ) . Consistent with the spontaneous hypertension phenotype , both strains developed hypertension to a similar extent beginning at 8 weeks of age ( Figure 1B ) . As Dnm2 is the ubiquitous and prevalent form of dynamin , we measured both glomerular Dnm2 and Dnm1 mRNA levels ( Figure 1C , D , respectively ) . When analyzing only the Dahl group , no significant differences in glomerular Dnm2 mRNA levels were seen between weeks 2 , 6 , 8 , and 10 . However , these levels were higher at 4 weeks of age than at all other time points ( p < 0 . 0001 compared with weeks 2 , 6 , 8 , and 10 ; Figure 1C ) . In SHR rats , a significant difference in glomerular Dnm2 levels was found when week 2 was compared with weeks 8 and 10 ( p < 0 . 001 and p < 0 . 01 , respectively ) and also between weeks 4 and 8 ( p < 0 . 05 , Figure 1C ) . A simi - lar analysis of glomerular Dnm1 mRNA levels in Dahl rats showed a gradual increase from week 2 to week 6 , after which the levels decreased . This difference is sig - nificant between weeks 6 and 10 ( p < 0 . 05 , Figure 1D ) . SHR rats showed very low expression of glomerular Dnm1 mRNA at week 2 which increased slightly , but not significantly , up until 6 weeks ( Figure 1D ) . None of the differences in mRNA levels at the different time points were significant in this group . When compar - ing dynamin mRNA levels between Dahl and SHR rats , the level of glomerular Dnm2 mRNA was sig - nificantly increased in Dahl rats compared with SHR rats at 2 and 4 weeks of age ( Figure 1C , p < 0 . 05 and p < 0 . 0001 , respectively ) . Glomerular Dnm1 mRNA was significantly higher in Dahl rats than in SHR rats at 2 , 4 , and 6 weeks of age ( Figure 1D ) . Interestingly , the levels of both Dnm1 mRNA and Dnm2 mRNA at 2 weeks of age were higher in Dahl rats than in SHR rats , which is before the onset of proteinuria ( i . e . at 6 weeks of age ) . Also , when comparing the different age groups , animals that will become proteinuric ( i . e . the © 2018 The Authors .

Scale bar = 50 μ m . Dahl rats ) have an increase in glomerular Dnm2 expres - sion prior to the onset of proteinuria . When compar - ing PCR C t values , Dnm2 mRNA levels were found to be more than ten times higher than Dnm1 levels . With respect to dynamin protein levels , immunohistochem - istry revealed that the protein was present at the tubular brush border and in podocytes in both Dahl and SHR rats ( Figure 1E , F ) at similar levels at both 4 and 6 weeks of age ( i . e . after Dahl rats develop proteinuria ) ( p = 0 . 6 , Figure 1G ) . Ctsl mRNA levels – but not protein area expression – are higher in Dahl rats than in SHR rats Cathepsin L , encoded by the Ctsl gene , is an enzyme that cleaves dynamin [ 3 ] . We therefore measured the expression of cathepsin L in the glomeruli of Dahl and SHR rats using RT - PCR ( Figure 1I ) . We found that Ctsl mRNA levels were significantly higher in the glomeruli of Dahl rats compared with SHR , ranging from 1 . 3 - fold to 1 . 7 - fold higher , at all ages tested ( p < 0 . 01 ) . Immuno - histochemistry revealed that there was no difference between Dahl and SHR rats in the glomerular cathepsin L - positive area ( p = 0 . 11 and p = 0 . 70 at 4 and 6 weeks of age , respectively ; Figure 1H ) . Knocking down dynamin translation causes proteinuria Next , we knocked down dynamin expression in zebrafish embryos using morpholino injection followed by injection of a mixture of 3 and 70 kDa dextran tracers ( Figure 2A , B ) . As a positive control for inducing proteinuria , a separate group of embryos received an injection of puromycin aminonucleoside ( PAN ) . We then quantified the reabsorption of dextran droplets . Our analysis revealed that the mean number of 3 kDa dextran droplets was similar between control zebrafish ( which received an injection of a scram - bled morpholino ) , dynamin - knockdown zebrafish , and PAN - injected zebrafish ( p = 0 . 96 , Figure 2C ) , indicat - ing that knockdown of dynamin in this model does not significantly affect tubular reabsorption . In contrast , the dynamin - knockdown zebrafish had significantly more reabsorption of 70 kDa droplets compared with control zebrafish ( p < 0 . 0001 , Figure 2D ) , indicating that loss of dynamin increases glomerular permeability , as also shown in the zebrafish model by Schiffer et al [ 7 ] . Dynamin protein levels are increased in the glomeruli of patients with proteinuria Finally , we examined the expression of dynamin in the kidneys of patients with proteinuria ( Figure 3A – D ) . Biopsies were obtained from patients with pro - teinuric kidney disease and control subjects , and stained by immunohistochemistry for the presence of dynamin . Positive staining was found primarily in podocytes , at the tubular epithelial brush border , and in endothelial cells of larger vessels . When individual disease groups were compared with the controls , the glomeruli of patients with minimal change disease ( MCD ) and lupus nephritis ( LN ) had a significantly higher dynamin - positive area percentage ( p = 0 . 03 and p = 0 . 04 , respectively ; Figure 3I ) .

A digital high - pass filter has been placed over panels A and B to enhance the contrast between reabsorption droplets and the surrounding tissue . The images in A and B were taken at the same magnification . Scale bar = 10 μ m . glomeruli were included in these analyses . No correla - tion was found between proteinuria levels and dynamin expression levels ( Figure 3K ) . Cathepsin L protein levels are also increased in the glomeruli of patients with proteinuria The same cohort was also stained by immunohistochem - istry for the presence of cathepsin L ( Figure 3E – H ) . We found a significantly higher glomerular cathepsin L - positive area percentage in patients with MCD , LN , and IgA nephropathy ( IgAN ; p < 0 . 0001 compared with controls in all three groups , Figure 3J ) . A positive corre - lation was found between the glomerular positive area percentages for dynamin and cathepsin L ( r = 0 . 928 , p = 0 . 0075 ) . Discussion Here , we have investigated dynamin expression under proteinuric conditions in both patients and rats . In addition , we examined whether dynamin is involved in glomerular proteinuria , tubular proteinuria , or both . We found a significant increase in the glomerular levels of Dnm2 and Dnm1 mRNA in Dahl rats prior to the onset of albuminuria . We also showed that knocking down dynamin translation results in proteinuria in a zebrafish embryo model . Lastly , we found that the glomerular lev - els of dynamin and cathepsin L protein are significantly increased in patients with proteinuric kidney disease . Our finding of increased dynamin protein and Dnm1 and Dnm2 mRNA levels in proteinuric disease , com - bined with the results of Soda et al [ 4 ] showing that dynamin knock out results in proteinuria , leads to the following two hypotheses on dynamin’s role in GFB integrity . First , a minimum level of dynamin may be required for adequate GFB integrity ; thus , if this level is not reached , GFB integrity is lost . Second , when the GFB is under stress , dynamin may be upregulated in an attempt to maintain or restore GFB integrity . We pre - viously studied the expression of proteins required for proper GFB function in patients with acquired protein - uria and found changes that suggest a compensatory mechanism [ 19 ] . Thus , disease progression may occur when this compensatory mechanism becomes saturated or exhausted . In Dahl rats , which spontaneously develop protein - uria , we found that the levels of Dnm1 and Dnm2 mRNA are increased prior to the onset of proteinuria , a symptom that manifests only when protein is present in excreted urine . Proteinuria occurs when proteins pass through the GFB and are not sufficiently reabsorbed by the tubular system , due to either saturation or malfunction of the tubular reabsorption process . Thus , the increase in glomerular Dnm1 and Dnm2 mRNA levels prior to the onset of proteinuria might reflect a compensatory mech - anism in response to an early , presymptomatic increase in GFB permeability that does not yet lead to actual proteinuria . However , as proteinuric disease progresses , this compensatory system can become exhausted , thereby failing to prevent the onset of proteinuria . © 2018 The Authors .

All images were taken at the same magnification . Scale bar = 50 μ m . This hypothetical process is depicted schematically in Figure 4 . Interestingly , we found that while animals that will become proteinuric ( Dahl rats ) express both more glomerular Dnm2 and Dnm1 mRNA before the onset of proteinuria , this does not result in an increase in dynamin protein . However , since dynamin is a regu - latory GTPase , it is not necessary to have an increase in protein level to have an altered intracellular activ - ity . Also , cathepsin L - mediated cleavage of dynamin may be increased and cause a decrease in dynamin protein staining [ 3 ] . In humans , we found that there is indeed an increase in glomerular cathepsin L protein which directly and strongly correlated with glomerular dynamin protein levels , as also observed by Sever et al [ 3 ] . Cleavage of dynamin by cytosolic L generates a 40 kDa N - terminal fragment of dynamin . As the used antibody recognizes an epitope of residues 822 – 838 of dynamin , these fragments were not identifiable in the immunohistochemistry experiments performed in this study . In our study , we found significantly higher levels of Ctsl mRNA in Dahl rats at all ages investigated , suggesting that in this rat model both the transcription and the post - translational cleavage of dynamin are increased . Although the Hudy 1 antibody used does not distinguish between DNM1 and DNM2 proteins , the higher Dnm2 mRNA levels suggest that Dnm2 is the more prevalent type of dynamin , as also reported by others [ 4 ] . We found that the glomerular levels of dynamin pro - tein were increased primarily in patients with minimal change disease ( MCD ) and lupus nephritis . Schiffer et al recently proposed that dynamin’s principal role in main - taining podocyte structure and preventing proteinuria is independent of the underlying disease pathogenesis [ 7 ] Our results are consistent with this notion , given that lupus nephritis is considered to be immunological in ori - gin , whereas MCD is not [ 20 , 21 ] . Sever et al previously reported that the levels of CTSL mRNA were increased in the glomeruli of patients with acquired proteinuric disease [ 3 ] . Notably , the levels of CTSL mRNA expression were increased in patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) and in patients with diabetic nephropathy , but not in patients with MCD . Interestingly , we found that dynamin expres - sion was significantly increased in patients with MCD , but not in patients with FSGS or diabetic nephropathy ; Sever et al did not measure CTSL mRNA in patients © 2018 The Authors .

Increased dynamin expression precedes proteinuria . Flow chart illustrating the proposed compensatory mechanism in response to impaired integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier , in which increased dynamin expression precedes proteinuria . After damage to the glomerular filtration barrier , DNM1 and DNM2 are upregulated , leading to increased levels of DNM1 and DNM2 mRNA . Whether this increase results in increased levels of dynamin protein depends on the oligomerization status of dynamin and the activity of cathepsin L , which selectively cleaves non - oligomerized dynamin [ 3 ] . If the total amount of dynamin is sufficient , the glomerular filtration barrier remains intact , preventing the onset of proteinuria . However , if dynamin levels are insufficient – and / or if this compensatory response is exhausted – proteinuria develops . The suggested mechanisms of cytoskeletal architecture maintenance and nephrin turnover have been reported by others [ 3 – 5 , 7 , 8 , 22 – 24 ] . with lupus nephritis . In our study , we found signifi - cantly more cathepsin L protein in the glomeruli of patients with MCD , lupus nephritis , and IgA nephropa - thy . Although we did see an increase in the glomerular cathepsin L - positive area percentage in DN patients , as also reported by Sever et al , this increase was not statis - tically significant . Thus , taken together , these results suggest that in human proteinuric disease , the interplay between cathepsin L and dynamin is part of a regulatory system influenced by proteinuria , as proposed previously [ 3 ] . Dynamin’s protective effect on the GFB could be effected through its role in nephrin turnover , as sug - gested by other groups [ 4 , 22 – 24 ] . Nephrin ( encoded in rats by the Nphs1 gene ) is a core component of the glomerular slit diaphragm [ 25 ] . In podocytes , nephrin is internalized by clathrin - mediated endocytosis and clathrin - independent raft - mediated endocytosis , both of which are dynamin - dependent processes [ 23 ] . We pre - viously reported that Nphs1 mRNA levels are increased significantly in Dahl rats by 10 weeks of age , although the pattern of nephrin protein is focal and segmental rather than linear , and effacement of the podocyte foot process occurs [ 26 ] . In this study , we found that the levels of Dnm1 and Dnm2 mRNA are significantly lower at 10 weeks of age compared with younger ages . These results suggest that the relative decrease in Dnm1 and Dnm2 mRNA in Dahl rats at later ages results in a loss of sufficient nephrin turnover , which then leads to reduced protection against podocyte pathology . Dynamin also directly interacts with the actin cytoskeleton , as shown by others [ 3 , 5 , 7 , 8 ] . Consis - tent with this structural role , our microarray analysis revealed additional evidence that the cytoskeletal archi - tecture is disrupted in Dahl rats , given the differential regulation of cytoskeleton - related genes . Further stud - ies will likely provide new insight into how the actin cytoskeleton is regulated under proteinuric conditions . In conclusion , our results provide evidence that dynamin expression is increased in human protein - uric disease . Moreover , we propose that a minimum level of dynamin is required for GFB integrity , and increases in Dnm1 and Dnm2 mRNA are part of a compensatory mechanism that supports GFB integrity under stressful conditions . Given that this mechanism seems to play a role in patients with proteinuric kidney disease , dynamin may represent a promising target for therapeutic intervention . © 2018 The Authors .
