Here I show that SRC - 1 , an orthologue of SFK , plays an essential role in directing cell migration in Caenorhabditis elegans . The mutation in the src - 1 gene results in defective distal tip cell ( DTC ) - directed gonad morphogenesis in an activity - dependent and DTC cell - autonomous manners . In the src - 1 mutants , DTCs fail to turn and continue their centrifugal migration along the ventral muscles . The effect of the src - 1 mutation is suppressed by mutations in genes that function in the CED / Rac pathway , suggesting that SRC - 1 in DTCs is an upstream regulator of a Rac pathway that controls cytoskeletal remodeling . In the src - 1 mutant , the expression of unc - 5 / netrin receptor is normally regulated , and either the precocious expression of UNC - 5 or the mutation in the unc - 5 gene does not significantly affect the DTC migration defect . These data suggest that SRC - 1 acts in the netrin signaling in DTCs . The src - 1 mutant also exhibits cell - autonomous defects in the migration and growth cone path finding of Q neuroblast descendants AVM and PVM . However , these roles of SRC - 1 do not appear to involve the CED / Rac pathway . These findings show that SRC - 1 functions in responding to various extracellular guidance cues that direct the cell migration via disparate signaling pathways in different cell types . 4 General introduction The tyrosine phosphorylation events have been implicated in the regulation of a variety of cellular functions including cell proliferation , migration , differentiation , survival and neuritegenesis . On the other hand mutation and changing of the expression levels of PTKs or its substrates are often observed in the tumor cells and some congenital anomalies in vertebrates . Therefore protein tyrosine kinases play pivotal roles for developing and maintaining the order of the cell society . PTKs are classified into two groups , that is to say , receptor type PTKs and non - receptor type PTKs . Receptor type PTKs are further divided to subfamilies by their structural characteristics , they commonly function as follows ; ligand binding to their extracellular domain triggers activation of intracellular kinase domain and causes phosphorylation of downstream substrates . On the other hand , non - receptor type PTKs are cytoplasmic or membrane associated proteins . Various ways of activation mechanism are known for this class of PTKs , but it has not been fully dissolved . Typically , they are activated by interacting with the upstream proteins like cell surface receptors or by the change of phosphorylation states by other PTKs and protein phosphatases . To date , ninety unique PTK genes were identified in a human genome as a result of the genome project . Those genes were classified into twenty subfamilies of receptor PTKs and ten subfamilies of non - receptor PTKs ( Robinson et al . , 2000 ) . Of these , src was the first identified gene that encodes a protein tyrosine kinase , and at the same time it was the discovery of tyrosine phosphorylation event in a cell . The src gene product , Src was originally identified as the transforming protein of a chicken tumor retrovirus , Rous sarcoma virus ( RSV ) , discovered in 1910 by Peyton Rous ( Brugge and Erikson , 1977 ; Purchio et al . , 1978 ; Rous , 1979 ) . Although RSV has only four genes , it has an ability to cause tumors in 5 chicken and transform cells in vitro . Of these genes , three of them are needed for viral life cycle and only one gene named v - src is required for triggering cell transformation ( Martin et al . , 1971 ; Vogt , 1971 ; Lai et al . , 1973 ) . A major breakthrough for understanding the v - src gene product ( v - Src ) came from the findings that v - Src possesses an intrinsic PTK activity ( Collett and Erikson , 1978 ; Levinson et al . , 1978 ; Collett et al . , 1980 ; Hunter and Sefton , 1980 ) and Src PTK activity was found important for cellular transformation ( Snyder et al . , 1983 ) . Moreover , a homologous sequence of the src gene was discovered in normal avian genomic DNA ( Stehelin et al . , 1976 ) . The cellular form of Src , c - Src , in normal cells also possesses the PTK activity . However , the PTK activity of c - Src was lower than that of v - Src and c - Src did not cause cell transformation ( Iba et al . , 1984 ; Tanaka and Fujita , 1986 ) . The most striking difference between c - Src and v - Src was found at the carboxy - terminal amino acids sequence containing a negative regulatory region of c - Src activity ( Takeya and Hanafusa , 1983 ; Brown and Cooper , 1996 ) . Further evidence showed that v - src gene was originated from c - src gene by DNA recombination during the retroviral life cycle . In vertebrates eight proteins were found to share common structural features and significant sequence homology to Src : Fyn , c - Yes , Lyn , Lck , Hck , Blk , c - Fgr and c - Src itself ( Brown and Cooper , 1996 ) . The group of these non - recepter PTKs was named as Src family tyrosine kinases ( SFKs ) . SFKs are 52 - 62 kDa proteins and have six distinctive functional regions in their structure ( Fig . 1 ) . In the N - terminus they have a 15 - amino acid sequence ( SH4 domain ) that is myristoylated and / or palmitoylated serving as a membrane - targeting signal . Following the SH4 domain there is a unique domain where the sequence homology is not obviously seen among SFK members . This domain has been proposed to be important for recognition of specific interactant for each family member . The four regions follow the unique domain . They are SH3 domain , SH2 domain , catalytic ( SH1 ) domain and the negative regulatory C - terminal tail . The 6 SH3 and SH2 domain binds to proline - rich motif ( P - X - X - P motif ) and phosphotyrosine containing motif ( pY - X - X - y motif ) , respectively . Both of these serve as the protein binding domains and exist in the diverse signaling proteins ( Cohen et al . , 1995 ) . In addition , the SH3 and SH2 domains play a central role in the negative regulation of SFKs’ own activity , as described later . The catalytic ( SH1 ) domain possesses the PTK activity . Biochemical and X - ray crystallographic analyses have revealed that the conserved tyrosine residue within the activation loop of the catalytic domain is important for positive regulation of SFKs’ activity . This tyrosine residue is autophosphorylated when SFKs are activated and its autophosphorylation leads them to fully active state . SFKs were studied in mammal prior to other animals . SFKs were conserved in all multicellular organisms . C . elegans is known for the most simplest multicellular model organisms . All cell linages was revealed , genome project was finished , experimental methods , such as RNAi , were established . C . elegans have 19 . 000 genes . Ortholog of SFK are only two genes , src - 1 and src - 2 . Although the function of SFKs is critical in many signal transduction , Src KO mice was viable . Knockout of multi SFKs brings lethality . These things suggest that there are redundancy and complementation of SFKs ' function in mammal . However , loss of function of one SFK , src - 1 , resulted in embryonic lethal in C . elegans . Using nematode is solution for avoiding the problem of redundancy . In this study , I investigated the postembryonic roles of src - 1 which is the major SFK in C . elegans . SRC - 1 is necessary for the migration of cells , and regulation of polarity . 7 Introduction Cell migration is crucial for the development of multicellular animals ( Hedgecock et al . , 1987 ; Antebi et al . , 1997 ) . Concerted cell movements are required to establish the tissue layers during gastrulation , individual cell migration contributes to tissue organization and the establishment of the body pattern , and growth cone migrations help construct the neural network . Such cell and growth cone migrations are guided by extracellular cues that provide polarity information to the cell in the form of substratum - bound or diffusible molecules ( Tessier - Lavigne and Goodman , 1996 ; Varela - Echavarria and Guthrie , 1997 ) . However , it remains unclear how these extracellular cues are transduced by the cell into the cytoskeletal and molecular motor activities that result in cell migration . The gonad of a Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite is located in the anterior - right and posterior - left areas of the body cavity ( Fig . 1A ) . This bilobed gonad develops during larval development from a 4 - cell primordium positioned in the ventral midbody . The shape of the two gonad arms is determined by the migratory path of a distal tip cell ( DTC ) at the leading edge of each arm ( Kimble and Hirsh , 1979 ; Hedgecock et al . , 1987 ) . DTC migration proceeds through three sequential linear phases ( Fig . 1B ) . Phase I is the centrifugal migration along the ventral bands of the body wall muscles away from the midbody . Phase II begins with a right - angled turn of DTC , after which it migrates along the inner surface of the epidermis from the ventral to the dorsal muscle bands . Finally , in phase III , DTC makes another right - angled turn and then migrates centripetally along the dorsal muscle bands back towards the midbody ( Fig . 1B ) ( Kimble and Hirsh , 1979 ; Hedgecock et al . , 1987 ) . DTC migration is regulated by several extracellular guidance cues ( Hedgecock et al . , 1987 ; Leung - Hagesteijn et al . , 1992 ; Blelloch et . al . , 1999 ; Montell , 1999 ; Lehmann , 2001 ) . The ventral - to - dorsal migration of DTC during 8 phase II is mediated in part by the netrin family protein UNC - 6 and its receptors UNC - 5 and UNC - 40 ( Hedgecock et al . , 1990 ; Culotti and Merz , 1998 ) . UNC - 5 and UNC - 40 are expressed by DTC , whereas UNC - 6 is expressed by the ventral body wall muscles . These observations suggest that UNC - 5 and UNC - 40 mediate the chemorepulsion of DTC away from the ventrally expressed UNC - 6 ( Wadsworth et al . , 1996 ; Su et al . , 2000 ) . It has also been suggested that UNC - 129 / TGF - b is involved in DTC migration during phase II ( Colavita et al . , 1998 ; Nash et al . , 2000 ) . These guidance cues are transduced into cell signaling pathways to achieve cell migration . One of these pathways is the small G protein Rac signaling pathway , which is part of the cellular machinery involved in remodeling the actin cytoskeleton during DTC migration in response to these guidance cues . Upstream regulators of CED - 10 / Rac include CED - 2 / CrkII , CED - 5 / Dock180 , and CED - 12 / Elmo , which control DTC migration by regulating the actin cytoskeleton via an evolutionally conserved mechanism ( Wu and Horvitz , 1998 ; Reddien and Horvitz , 2000 ; Gumienny et al . , 2001 ; Wu et al . , 2001 ; Zhou et al . , 2001 ; Reddien and Horvitz , 2004 ) . Guidance cues also regulate the neuronal cell and growth cone migration in C . elegans . The two Q neuroblasts , QL and QR , are born on opposite sides of the animal in bilaterally symmetric positions ( Sulston and Horvitz , 1977 ; Chalfie and Sulston , 1981 ) . The Q cells migrate and then each divides to give rise to three neuronal descendants that also migrate . QL and its descendants migrate toward the posterior body , whereas QR and its descendants migrate anteriorly . Guidance cues that function in these cell migrations and axon guidances include a novel protein MIG - 13 ( Sym et al . , 1999 ) , UNC - 6 / Netrin family ( Chan et al . , 1996 ; Wadsworth et al . , 1996 ) and SAX - 3 / Robo receptor and its ligand SLT - 1 / Slit ( Zallen et al . , 1998 ; Hao et al . , 2001 ) . The extracellular cues directing the migration of neuronal cells and 9 growth cones also modulate the cytoskeletal organization . It has been shown that the Rac family proteins CED - 10 , MIG - 2 and RAC - 2 and their regulator UNC - 73 / Trio influence the actin cytoskeleton and regulate the migration of neuronal cells and growth cones in C . elegans ( Zipkin et al . , 1997 ; Steven et al . , 1998 ; Lundquist et al . , 2001 ; Lundquist , 2003 ) . Furthermore , the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by UNC - 34 / Enabled and UNC - 115 / abLIM , which act downstream of UNC - 40 / DCC , is implicated in the axon guidance of the AVM and DA / DB motor neurons and the axon pathfinding of the CAN and PDE neurons ( Yu et al . , 2002 ; Gitai et al . , 2003 ; Struckhoff and Lundquist , 2003 ; Chang et al . , 2004 ) . Although these molecules , together with small G proteins , are potential effectors that drive cell migration , the signaling pathways that directly relay the extracellular guidance cues to these effectors of cell migration are still unclear . Tyrosine phosphorylation is required for crucial functions in multicellular animals such as cell differentiation , cell adhesion and migration , axon guidance and cell - cell communication ( Hunter , 2000 ) . The Src family of non - receptor protein tyrosine kinases ( SFKs ) serves as a critical molecular switch that transmits extracellular cues into the intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation events that lead to the cellular responses ( Brown and Cooper , 1996 ; Sicheri and Kuriyan , 1997 ; Thomas and Brugge , 1997 ) . In C . elegans , there are two SFK orthologues , src - 1 and src - 2 / kin - 22 ( Bei et al . , 2002 ; Hirose et al . , 2003 ) . A deletion allele of src - 1 , cj293 , was originally isolated by imprecise transposon excision ( Bei et al . , 2002 ) . The src - 1 ( cj293 ) allele lacks the SH2 and kinase domains and is potentially a null allele . Homozygous src - 1 ( cj293 ) hermaphrodites are themselves viable but produce inviable embryos , suggesting SRC - 1 plays essential roles in early development . It has been shown that SRC - 1 is required for the accumulation of tyrosine - phosphorylated proteins at the membrane boundary between the P2 10 and EMS cells , and functions in parallel with Wnt / Wg signaling to specify the endoderm and to orient the division axis of EMS in the early embryo ( Bei et al . , 2002 ) . However , the functions of SRC - 1 in organogenesis and the development of nervous system , where SRC - 1 is abundantly expressed , remain unknown ( Hirose et al . , 2003 ) . To address the roles SRC - 1 plays in the later stages of C . elegans development , I have characterized homozygous src - 1 ( cj293 ) hermaphrodites . I found that SRC - 1 is essential for directing the migration of DTCs and a subset of neuronal cell bodies , and the growth cone path findings , which are regulated by different guidance cues including UNC - 6 / netrin . Furthermore , analyses of the genetic interactions between SRC - 1 and potential downstream factors revealed that SRC - 1 transduces the various extracellular guidance cue that direct cell migration via different pathways that depend on the cell type . 11 Materials and methods Strains and genetics C . elegans strains were cultured at 20°C as described by Brenner ( 1974 ) . N2 Bristol served as the wild - type strain . The alleles used are listed by linkage groups . The strains used include LGI : src - 1 ( cj293 ) , ced - 12 ( k149 ) , src - 2 ( ok819 ) , hT2 [ qIs48 ] ( I ; III ) ; LGII : muIs32 [ mec - 7 : : gfp , lin - 15 ( + ) ] ; LGIV : ced - 2 ( n1994 ) , ced - 10 ( n1993 ) , unc - 5 ( e53 ) , ced - 5 ( n1812 ) , rac - 2 ( ok326 ) , kyIs179 [ unc - 86 : : gfp , lin - 15 ( + ) ] ; LGV : qIs19 [ lag - 2 : : gfp , rol - 6 ( su1006 ) ] , evls54 [ unc - 5B : : lacZ ; rol - 6 ( su1006dm ) ] ; and LGX : mig - 2 ( mu28 ) , kyIs4 [ che - 23 : : gfp , lin - 15 ( + ) ] . The hT2 translocation chromosome balances src - 1 ; the qIs48 insertion onto hT2 allows src - 1 ( cj293 ) / + heterozygotes to be distinguished from src - 1 ( cj293 ) homozygotes by the presence or absence of the GFP marker inserted onto hT2 ( Wang and Kimble , 2001 ) . Double mutant strains were constructed by standard methods . The mutations in the double mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing or PCR for the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutation . Phenotypic analysis Gonad morphology was observed on a 5 % agar pad in M9 buffer by Nomarski differential interference contrast microscopy . The DTC migration pattern was inferred from the gonadal morphology of young adults at 20°C except as indicated . At the L1 stage , the positions of the AVM , ALM and PVM neurons were determined by using mec - 7 : : gfp , muIs32 ( Ch’ng et al . , 2003 ) , the position of CAN was determined by using che - 23 : : gfp , kyIs4 ( Forrester and Garriga , 1997 ) , and the position of HSN was determined by using unc - 86 : : gfp , kyIs179 ( Shen and Bargmann , 2003 ) . The images of the neuronal cells were captured by a LSM - 510 confocal laser - scanning microscope ( Zeiss ) . The positions of AVM , ALM , CAN , HSN and PVM were scored on the basis of their positions relative to the V cell daughters , since these are stationary landmarks . 12 A defect in the AVM axon morphology was scored when it failed to extend in the anterior direction after the nerve ring branch . A defect in the PVM axon morphology was scored when it failed to turn in the anterior direction after reaching the ventral nerve cord . Defects in ALM , CAN , HSN and PLM migration were determined by comparisons with their wild - type morphology . This morphology was defined by electron microscopic reconstitution of the C . elegans nervous system ( White et al . , 1986 ) . Feeding RNAi RNAi was performed essentially as described by Timmons and Fire ( 1998 ) . After preparing the src - 1 RNAi feeding plate , some parental worms were allowed to lay eggs on the plates for 3 - 4 hours and were then removed . The remaining eggs were cultured into young adults and then assessed for gonad morphology . Plasmid construction To express src - 1 , the src - 1 cDNA was amplified by PCR from the plasmid yk117f2 and cloned into pPD49 . 26 carrying the src - 1 promoter ( 4 . 9 kbp ) to generate Psrc - 1 : : src - 1 . pPD49 . 26 carrying the lag - 2 promoter ( 3 . 0 kbp ) was kindly provided by J . Kimble and was used to generate Plag - 2 : : src - 1 . pPD95 . 86 and pPD96 . 41 were used to generate Pmyo - 3 : : src - 1 and Pmec - 7 : : src - 1 , respectively . To generate the kinase - negative form of src - 1 , the lysine 290 residue was substituted with methionine to produce src - 1K290M . src - 1K290M was then inserted into the vectors described above instead of src - 1 . Transgenic strains Transgenic lines were generated using standard techniques ( Mello et . 13 al . , 1991 ) . For rescue experiments , a lin - 44 : : gfp construct was co - injected as a marker ( 50 mg / ml ) . To rescue the defect in DTC migration , the expression construct was injected at 1 mg / ml into the src - 1 / hT2 [ qIs48 ] heterozygote with an injection marker . The defect in DTC migration was then scored in the src - 1 ( cj293 ) homozygote carrying the extrachromosomal array . To rescue the defects in the positioning of AVM cell body , src - 1 or src - 1K290M in pPD96 . 41 was injected at 50 mg / ml into the src - 1 / hT2 [ qIs48 ] heterozygote with an injection marker . To rescue the aberrant growth cone migration of PVM , src - 1 or src - 1K290M in pPD96 . 41 was injected at 50 mg / ml into the src - 1 / hT2 [ qIs48 ] heterozygote with an injection marker . The axon trajectories of PVM were observed by fluorescence microscopy and were compared with those in the src - 1 ( cj293 ) homozygote . For the precocious expression of unc - 5 , the plasmid pSU16 ( emb - 9 : : unc - 5 ) construct ( a gift from J . G . Culotti and L . Brown ) was injected at 1 mg / ml into the src - 1 / hT2 [ qIs48 ] worms with an injection marker . The gonad morphology of the resulting heterozygotes ( src - 1 / + ) and homozygotes ( src - 1 / src - 1 ) was then analyzed . Tissue staining Adult worms were dissected and fixed essentially as described by Francis et al . ( 1995 ) . Briefly , the dissected gonads were fixed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde for 1 hr and postfixed with 100 % methanol for 5 min . The specimens were then blocked with 3 % BSA in 0 . 1 % Tween TBS , and stained with anti - phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody , 4G10 ( Upstate ) , followed by detection with secondary antibodies conjugated with Texas Red . The images were captured by confocal laser - scanning microscopy on a Fluoview FV1000 ( Olympus ) . For the unc - 5 reporter assay , staining for b - galactosidase activity was carried out as described previously ( Fire et al . , 1990 ) . 14 RESULTS Defects in DTC migration caused by the src - 1 mutation . To examine the roles of SRC - 1 in the development of postembryonic stages , I analyzed a homozygous src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant produced from the balanced heterozygote src - 1 ( cj293 ) / + , since the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant showed a maternal embryonic lethal phenotype ( Bei et al . , 2002 ) . The src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutants grew into adults but showed an apparent defect in gonad morphogenesis ( Fig . 2 ) . DTCs in the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant migrated normally during the first phase but frequently failed to turn at subsequent phases of gonad development . Consequently , DTCs continued their centrifugal migration along the ventral muscles and the tips of the anterior and posterior lobes eventually reached the pharynx and anus , respectively ( Fig . 2F ) . I here term this defect as “no - turn phenotype” . Perhaps because of space limitations , these extended gonads in the adult worms became randomly bent and accordionated ( Fig . 2H ) . I also analyzed worms that had developed on src - 1 RNAi feeding plates . The src - 1 ( RNAi ) worms had a similar phenotype to the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutants . Observed DTC migrations were classified into three categories ( Table I ) . The first is the normal migration path ( 100 % in N2 , 19 % in src - 1 ( cj293 ) , 28 % in src - 1 ( RNAi ) ) . The second type represents the migration path that turns in the opposite direction during the third phase ( 0 % in N2 , 16 % in src - 1 ( cj293 ) , 8 % in src - 1 ( RNAi ) ) . The third type is the no - turn phenotype , which was the most frequently exhibited phenotype for the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant and the src - 1 ( RNAi ) worms ( 0 % in N2 , 65 % in src - 1 ( cj293 ) , 64 % in src - 1 ( RNAi ) ) . These results raise the possibility that DTCs in the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutants are not being controlled by the guidance cues that direct their turning at the appropriate time and position . As indicated above , the defect in DTC migration in the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant was phenocopied in the src - 1 ( RNAi ) worms ( Table I ; Fig . 3 ) , but there were some differences in the frequencies of the defects . The frequency of DTC 15 migration defects in the src - 1 ( RNAi ) worms was 72 % for both the anterior and posterior lobes : those in the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant were 50 % and 80 % , respectively ( Fig . 3I ) . The lower frequency of anterior lobe defects in the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant may be due to some maternal effects in this mutant . The mutation or RNAi of another SFK , SRC - 2 , did not result in any defects in DTC migration ( Fig . 3E , F , I ) , suggesting that SRC - 1 plays a specific role in regulating DTC migration . Moreover , in contrast to the hermaphrodites , the gonads in male src - 1 ( cj293 ) worms were apparently normal ( Fig . 3G - I ) . This suggests that the mechanism involved in the migration of the male linker cells is different from that guiding DTCs . To determine whether the defects in the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant are due to the loss of SRC - 1 function in DTCs , SRC - 1 was expressed in the mutant under the src - 1 promoter or the DTC - specific lag - 2 promoter ( Fig . 4 ) . The expression of SRC - 1 under either promoter rescued the defects , with the defect frequency being decreased to 12 % / 33 % in the anterior / posterior lobes by the src - 1 promoter and to 10 % / 41 % by the lag - 2 promoter ( Fig . 4G ) . However , the defect was not rescued by expression of a kinase - negative form of SRC - 1 ( SRC - 1K290M ) or by the expression of SRC - 1 under the body wall muscle - specific myo - 3 promoter . These results demonstrate that SRC - 1 acts in an activity - dependent and DTC cell - autonomous manner . To further examine the contribution of SRC - 1 to DTC migration , the expression of SRC - 1 was determined by detecting the expression of a reporter gene ( GFP ) expressed under the src - 1 promoter . The expression of src - 1 gene was clearly detected in DTCs ( Fig . 5A , B ) as described previously ( Hirose et al . , 2003 ) . Furthermore , immunostaining with an anti - phosphotyrosine antibody ( 4G10 ) , which specifically recognizes phosphorylated tyrosine residues of various proteins , revealed high levels of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in DTCs ( Fig . 5C ) . In contrast , DTCs in the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant gave only faint 16 signals ( Fig . 5D ) , showing that SRC - 1 activity is a major source of tyrosine phosphorylation in DTCs . Genetic interaction of the src - 1 gene with other genes involved in DTC migration . To position SRC - 1 in a cell signaling pathway involved in DTC migration , I first analyzed the genetic interaction of src - 1 with components of the Rac pathway , including ced - 2 / CrkII , ced - 5 / Dock180 , ced - 12 / Elmo , and ced - 10 / Rac . Mutations in these genes induce unregulated turns of DTC migration ( Wu and Horvitz , 1998 ; Reddien and Horvitz , 2000 ; Gumienny et al . , 2001 ; Wu et al . , 2001 ; Zhou et al . , 2001 ; Reddien and Horvitz , 2004 ) . I analyzed DTC migration in the following double mutants : src - 1 ; ced - 2 , src - 1 ; ced - 5 , src - 1 ; ced - 10 and src - 1 ; ced - 12 . In these experiments , the phenotypes of these mutants were evaluated by assessing the occurrence of typical no - turn phenotype of the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant ( Table II ) . The ced mutations alone did not induce no - turn phenotype . However , the no - turn phenotype of src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant was drastically suppressed in the src - 1 ; ced - 2 , src - 1 ; ced - 5 , and src - 1 ; ced - 12 double mutants . The effects were evident in both gonad lobes with the frequency being decreased from 13 % / 70 % ( anterior / posterior lobes ) to 2 % / 13 % , 2 % / 5 % and 2 % / 7 % in the src - 1 ; ced - 2 , src - 1 ; ced - 5 , and src - 1 ; ced - 12 double mutants , respectively . These results suggest that SRC - 1 potentially acts as a suppressor of the Rac signaling pathway . Furthermore , in these double mutants , DTCs turned twice as in wild - type worm , raising the possibility that there exists an alternative pathway that functions in parallel to the src - 1 / ced pathway . In src - 1 ; ced - 10 double mutant , the no - turn phenotype was only partially suppressed , with the frequency in the anterior / posterior lobes being 20 % / 45 % , suggesting that other genes function redundantly with ced - 10 in this signaling pathway . 17 There are two additional ced - 10 – related genes in C . elegans , namely , mig - 2 and rac - 2 . It has been reported that the mig - 2 mutant has the same kind of DTC migration defect observed in the ced mutants , suggesting the functional redundancy between MIG - 2 and CED - 10 ( Lundquist et al . , 2001 ; Lundquist , 2003 ) . However , since clear role for RAC - 2 in DTC migration has not been reported , I examined the relationship between src - 1 and these Rac relatives . In src - 1 ; mig - 2 mutants , the no - turn phenotype was suppressed in the posterior lobes to the same extent as in src - 1 ; ced - 10 mutants , while it was significantly enhanced in src - 1 ; rac - 2 mutants ( 98 % ) ( Table II ) . These results suggest that RAC - 2 functions in parallel with SRC - 1 , but do not rule out the possibility that it also functions in the same signaling pathway as SRC - 1 . It is well established that the chemorepulsive mechanism mediated by UNC - 6 / netrin and its receptors UNC - 5 and UNC - 40 guide DTC migration , particularly during phase II ( Hedgecock et al , 1990 ) . The programmed expression of unc - 5 in DTCs is shown to time the turning of DTC migration ( Su et al . , 2000 ) . Mutations in unc - 5 ( e53 ) and unc - 6 ( ev400 ) , which are putative null alleles , cause specific defects in the ventral - to - dorsal migration of DTCs . In either src - 1 ( cj293 ) ; unc - 5 ( e53 ) mutants or src - 1 ( cj293 ) ; unc - 6 ( ev400 ) mutants , the no - turn defect characteristic for src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant was not significantly affected ( Table II ) . These observations demonstrate that src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutation is epistatic to unc - 5 ( e53 ) or unc - 6 ( ev400 ) mutations . Since the timing of DTC turning is affected by regulation of unc - 5 expression ( Su et al . , 2000 ) , I examined the effect of the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutation on the expression of unc - 5 by detecting the unc - 5 promoter activity ( unc - 5B : : lacZ ) . As shown in Fig . 6B , the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant at the L3 stage expressed unc - 5 at the appropriate time , while still showing the no - turn phenotype . Furthermore , the precocious turning of DTCs that is induced by the precocious expression of unc - 5 under the emb - 9 promoter ( emb - 9 : : unc - 5 ) was 18 substantially decreased from 30 % / 70 % ( anterior / posterior lobes ) in the src - 1 ( cj293 ) / + heterozygotes to 7 % / 14 % in the src - 1 ( cj293 ) homozygotes ( Fig . 6C , D ; Table III ) . These results suggest that the src - 1 mutant phenotype is epistatic to not only precocious but also normal DTC turning induced by UNC - 5 , and that SRC - 1 is required for UNC - 5 mediated signaling pathway that directs DTC migration . Defects in neuronal cell migration caused by the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutation . To examine the roles SRC - 1 plays in the migration of other cell types , I analyzed the migration of the QR and QL neuroblasts in the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant . In the wild - type worm , the QR neuroblast and its descendants migrate over long distances . As a result , the AVM neuron , a QR descendant , eventually becomes positioned anteriorly to the ALM neuron ( Fig . 7A , B , C ) . In the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant , however , the QR neuroblast and its descendants can migrate only a short distance and AVM is located posteriorly to ALM ( Fig . 7D , E ) . When SRC - 1 was expressed in the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant under the control of the mec - 7 promoter , which specifically acts in the mechanosensory neurons , including AVM , this cell migration defect was significantly rescued ( 42 % ) ( Table IV ) . The expression of a kinase - negative SRC - 1K290M could not rescue the defect at all , indicating that SRC - 1 acts cell - autonomously and in an activity - dependent manner in AVM . To examine the contribution of the Rac pathway to the migration of the QR neuroblast and its descendants , the ced - 5 ( n1812 ) and ced - 12 ( k149 ) mutants , which are molecular null alleles , were scored for cell migration defect ( Fig . 7F ) . However , no apparent defect was detected in either mutant . Furthermore , unlike the DTC defects , the AVM defect in the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant was not significantly modified by either the ced - 5 ( n1812 ) or ced - 12 ( k149 ) mutations . These findings suggest that SRC - 1 differentially employs 19 downstream pathways depending on the cell types . The migration of the PVM cell body , a QL neuroblast descendant , was normally positioned in either src - 1 or ced - 5 / - 12 mutants ( Fig . 7F ) . Moreover , the migration of CAN and HSN , was not significantly affected by the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutation ( data not shown ) . These observations reveal that SRC - 1 functions in the migration of a particular subset of neuronal cells . In this experiment , I found the misplacement of both ALMR and ALML in ced - 5 ( n1812 ) and ced - 12 ( k149 ) mutants ( Fig . 7G ) . In the wild - type worm , ALMR and ALML , which are sister cells , migrate posteriorly . In ced - 5 / - 12 mutants , half of ALMs can migrate only short distance . However , no apparent defects was detected in src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant . It is known that mig - 2 / Rac influence the embryonic migration of the ALM cells ( Hedgecock et al . , 1987 ) . Unlike AVM and PVM placement , ALM placement may be regulated by rac signaling pathway . Interestingly , the ALM defects were suppressed in src - 1 ; ced - 5 and src - 1 ; ced - 12 double mutants . The wandering migration of DTC in ced mutant was also suppressed by src - 1 mutation . These observations suggest that less signal of SRC - 1 affect returning to normal in case of ced mutant background . Defects in growth cone migration due to the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutation . The migration and direction of growth cones are also regulated by specific extracellular guidance cues . To examine whether SRC - 1 is involved in these processes , we observed the effect of the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutation on the axon trajectories of the AVM , ALM , CAN , HSN , PVM and PLM neurons . In the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant , apparent defects in the axon trajectory directions were observed for AVM , ALM , CAN and PVM with a penetrance of 60 % , 21 % , 38 % , and 46 % , respectively ( Fig . 8 ) . AVM axons failed to extend anteriorly after the nerve ring branch , while ALM axons were slightly bent probably because of 20 mislocation of the ALM cell body to ventral side . In CAN neurons , axons terminated prematurely and often branched inappropriately . Normally , the growth cones of PVM neurons make a right - angled turn anteriorly after reaching the ventral nerve cord ( Fig . 8H ) . In the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant , however , about half of the PVM growth cones ( 46 % ) turn in the opposite direction ( Fig . 8I - K ) . During this inappropriate migration , a substantial number of the PVM axons ( 26 % ) make a reverse turn in the anterior direction , thus allowing the growth cones to reach the anterior body ( Fig . 8J ) . These observations suggest that the PVM growth cones in the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant fail to respond to the guidance cues that direct their migration along the anterior - posterior axis . This defect was completely rescued by the expression of SRC - 1 but not the kinase - defective form of SRC - 1 under the mec - 7 promoter ( Table V ) , indicating again the cell - autonomous and kinase - dependent role of SRC - 1 in cell migration . However , as in the case of AVM cell body migration , the ced - 5 / - 12 mutations did not significantly alter the normal PVM growth cone migration , nor did they modify the src - 1 ( cj293 ) phenotype ( Table V ) . These observations suggest that SRC - 1 utilizes different downstream pathway in PVM to the one it uses in DTCs . 21 Discussion DTC migration in the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutants In this study , I first showed that the kinase activity of SRC - 1 is required for the patterned DTC migration that occurs during gonad morphogenesis . In the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant , the motility of DTCs seems to be normal because these cells migrate normally during phase I . In subsequent phases , however , DTCs fail to change direction , eventually traveling to the pharynx and anus ( Fig . 2 ) . These observations suggest that SRC - 1 is required for DTC response to the guidance cues that direct its migration , including UNC - 6 / netrin and UNC - 129 / TGF - b . A probable candidate upstream regulator of SRC - 1 is UNC - 5 / netrin receptor , which is known to regulate the ventral - to - dorsal phase II migration of DTCs ( Hedgecock et al , 1990 ; Culotti and Merz , 1998 ) . The genetic interactions of src - 1 with unc - 6 or unc - 5 suggest that SRC - 1 acts in the UNC - 6 / netrin signaling pathway through UNC - 5 , which is supported by the observations that the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutation does not affect the timing of the unc - 5 expression and suppresses DTC turning induced by not only precocious but also normal expression of unc - 5 . Previously , it was shown that UNC - 5 functions require phosphorylation of a cytoplasmic tyrosine residue , suggesting a critical role of a tyrosine kinase ( s ) in the UNC - 6 / netrin signaling pathway ( Killeen et al . , 2002 ) . It was also reported that the activation of a vertebrate Src family kinase is required for the phosphorylation of the netrin receptor and its subsequent cell signaling ( Li et al . , 2004 ; Liu et al . , 2004 ; Meriane et al . , 2004 ) , and that SRC - 1 could mediate UNC - 5 signaling in C . elegans by directly interacting with UNC - 5 ( Lee et al . , 2005 ) . These findings together with our observations support a model in which SRC - 1 acts as a component of a netrin signaling pathway , at least during a particular time period in gonad development . However , it is also notable that the precocious expression of UNC - 5 is still able to induce the precocious turning of DTC in the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutants , albeit with low frequency 22 ( 7 % / 14 % in anterior / posterior lobes ) . Thus , it remains possible that alternative SRC - 1 independent pathways can be involved in the guidance of DTC migration . Furthermore , the fact that the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutants fail to make the second turn that usually occurs during phase II reveals that SRC - 1 may also be required for the DTC to respond to some other signaling mechanism that directs the secondary turning of DTCs . In C . elegans , defects in DTC migration have been observed in the ced - 2 / CrkII , ced - 5 / Dock180 , ced - 10 / Rac and ced - 12 / Elmo mutants ( Wu and Horvitz , 1998 ; Reddien and Horvitz , 2000 ; Gumienny et al . , 2001 ; Wu et al . , 2001 ; Zhou et al . , 2001 ; Reddien and Horvitz , 2004 ) . CED - 2 , CED - 5 and CED - 12 form a ternary complex that can trigger the localized remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton through CED - 10 . It has also been shown that the Dock180 - Elmo complex functions as a guanine nucleotide - exchanging factor for Rac , and that CrkII binding enhances the functions of this complex ( Brugnera et al . , 2002 ) . Src may act upstream of this pathway to regulate cell migration through the actin cytoskeleton since the binding of CrkII to Dock180 is enhanced in v - Src transformed 3Y1 cells ( Kiyokawa et al . , 1998 ) . Furthermore , Hck , a Src family member , binds to Elmo1 through its SH3 domain in vitro and phosphorylates Elmo1 in cultured cells ( Scott et al . , 2002 ) . These lines of evidence strongly support our proposal that SRC - 1 functionally acts in the Rac pathway in DTCs . Of the three rac – related genes in C . elegans ( ced - 10 , mig - 2 and rac - 2 ) , CED - 10 and MIG - 2 have been shown to redundantly control the migration of some cells , including DTCs ( Lundquist et al . , 2001 ; Wu et al . , 2002 ) . Consistent with this is our observation , that a mutation in either mig - 2 or ced - 10 only partially suppressed the no - turn phenotype of DTC migration in the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant , whereas mutations in ced - 2 , ced - 5 or ced - 12 robustly suppressed this phenotype . These results suggest that CED - 10 and MIG - 2 function redundantly downstream of the CED - 2 complex under the control of 23 SRC - 1 . In contrast , a mutation in the rac - 2 gene enhanced the DTC migration defect in the src - 1 ( cj293 ) phenotype , suggesting that RAC - 2 is involved in DTC migration but acts in an alternative pathway independently of SRC - 1 . Our analysis of the genetic interaction between src - 1 and the genes in the Rac pathway revealed that the DTC migration defect of src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutants was suppressed in all the double mutants . This raised the possibility that SRC - 1 may act as an upstream suppressor of the Rac signaling pathway . If this is the case , it may be that the Rac pathway is constitutively active in migrating DTCs , allowing a continuous remodeling of the cytoskeleton . Upon exposure to some guidance cues that activate SRC - 1 ( potentially netrin ) , the Rac pathway is suppressed , thereby inhibiting actin remodeling ; this may be required for the DTC to change cell polarity and turn . This is consistent with the previous observation that loss - of – function of the Rac pathway induces an extra - turn phenotype ( Wu and Horvitz , 1998 ) . To verify this hypothesis , the mechanism by which SRC - 1 suppresses Rac activity should be elucidated . Notably , it is generally accepted that Src positively regulates the Rac signaling pathway in mammals . This inconsistency may be resolved by identifying downstream effectors of SRC - 1 that inactivate the Rac pathway in C . elegans . Neuronal cell and growth cone migration in the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutants . In the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant , I also observed apparent defects in the migration of neuronal cells . In particular , the positioning of AVM , a descendant of the QR neuroblast , is strongly affected by the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutation . As with DTC migration , the kinase activity of SRC - 1 is required for its role in the directional migration of QR and its descendants . While the cues that guide Q cell migration along the anterior - posterior axis are still unknown , it has been reported that the transmembrane protein MIG - 13 is a key determinant in the final positioning of AVM ( Sym et al . , 1999 ) . MIG - 13 expression is restricted to 24 the anterior and central body regions and functions in a non - cell - autonomous manner to promote migration in the anterior direction . Like the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant , a mig - 13 mutant shows defects in the migration of QR and its descendants , but not in the migration of QL and its descendants ( ALM , CAN and HSN ) . Furthermore , the final position of AVM in the mig - 13 mutant is quite similar to that in the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant . These observations raise the interesting possibility that SRC - 1 mediates the cell signaling induced by extracellular MIG - 13 cues . Mutations in ced - 5 / - 12 genes that affected DTC turning did not alter the migration defects of QR and its descendants in the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutants . This shows that the signaling pathways that are dependent on SRC - 1 vary depending on cell type . The src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant also showed defects in the migration of the growth cones of some neuronal cells , namely , AVM , ALM , CAN and PVM . For example , while the growth cone of PVM normally makes a right - angled turn in the anterior direction after reaching the ventral nerve cord , in the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant it frequently makes a turn in the opposite direction ( Fig . 8 ) . It appears that the axon of PVM in the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant may randomly determine the direction in which it turns . SRC - 1 may be involved in the regulation of cell signaling evoked by the guidance cues that direct the migration of a growth cone , suggesting that the migration of a neural growth cone uses the same mechanisms employed by migrating cell bodies like DTCs . However , identification of the guidance cues involved in the attraction or repulsion of the PVM growth cone within the ventral nerve cord will be required to confirm the role of SRC - 1 in this process . In this study , I showed initially that SRC - 1 plays a potential role in transducing the netrin signal to the Rac pathway at a particular time of DTC migration . However , our subsequent observations of neuronal cells and growth cones suggest that SRC - 1 plays a more general role in directing cell migration , 25 and that it does so via different pathways depending on the cell types . Thus , in response to various extracellular guidance cues , activated SRC - 1 may transduce the signals into an appropriate intracellular pathway that probably regulates the cytoskeletal remodeling required for providing polarity information to the cells . In vertebrates , Src family kinases have been shown to respond to a wide variety of extracellular cues , including guidance cues , extracellular matrices and growth factors , and to play roles in regulating a wide variety of cellular functions , including cell adhesion , migration , secretion , endocytosis , proliferation , and differentiation . These multifunctional aspects of Src family kinases have hampered the unraveling of their most critical function ( s ) . Further analysis of the functions of SRC - 1 , particularly by focusing on the process of cell migration , may help elucidate its basal role , which may be conserved during animal evolution . 26 References Antebi , A . , Norris , C .

DTC pharynx vulva anus L2 L3 L4 phase I phase II phase III DTC gonad A B * * * Fig . 1 . ( A ) Schematic representation of the gonad structure of a wild - type her - maphrodite .

( B ) Schematic illustration of the time course and pattern of gonad lobe extensions in wild - type hermaphrodites ( lateral view ) . The DTCs lead the exten - sion of the gonad lobes in three migration phases . First , the DTCs are generated at the ventral mid - body during the L2 stage and migrate in opposite directions along the ventral body wall muscle ( phase I ) . They then turn orthogonally and migrate over the lateral hypodermis towards the dorsal muscles during the L3 stage ( phase II ) . After reaching the dorsal side , the DTCs turn again and migrate towards the midbody along the dorsal body wall muscles during the L4 stage ( phase III ) . The ventral midbody is marked with an asterisk . A B C D E F G H WT src - 1 ( cj293 ) L2 L3 Adult Adult Fig . 2 . Defective DTC migration in the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant . The position of DTC was monitored by analyzing the expression of lag - 2 : : gfp in wild - type ( A , C , E , G ) and src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant worms ( B , D , F , H ) . The DTCs migrate in opposite direc - tions along the ventral body wall muscle during the L2 stage in both the wild - type and mutant ( A , B ) . However , the DTCs fail to turn dorsally in the src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant ( D ) during the L3 stage and continue their centrifugal migration in the anterior and posterior directions ( F ) . In contrast , in the wild - type worm at the adult stage , the DTCs migrate centripetally along the dorsal muscle bands back toward the midbody ( E ) . In the adult src - 1 ( cj293 ) mutant , the extended gonads are randomly bent and accordionated ( H ) . The arrowheads indicate the DTCs . Arrows show the migration pattern of the DTCs .
