Aesthetic Theory COLT 602 , Class # 22088 , Fall 2007 , Wednesdays , 5 - 8 : 00pm , THH 217 De Chirico , Enigma of a Day ( 1913 ) This course is simply a reading of several crucial works on Aesthetic Theory : Kant ' s Third Critique , Schiller ' s Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man , Hegel ' s Introduction to the Lectures on Aesthetics , and Adorno ' s Aesthetic Theory . From time to time a few important interpretive essays will be assigned , but for the most part this will be a course based on careful readings of these texts . Students should endeavour to read all of these over the summer . Much of the course will focus on the relation between aesthetics and politics and between aesthetic theory and culture as an object of study , but there will be room for very many issues , including the relation between aesthetic theory and historical art practices . This is a reading course , and students will be expected to produce a small number of response papers rather than a longer research essay .
