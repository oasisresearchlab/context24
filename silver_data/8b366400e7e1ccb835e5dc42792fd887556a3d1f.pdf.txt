1 Temporal search in the scientific space predicts breakthrough inventions Chao Min 1 and Qing Ke 2 , * 1 Nanjing University 2 Syracuse University * Corresponding author : qke100 @ syr . edu Abstract The development of inventions is theorized as a process of searching and recombining existing knowledge components . Previous studies under this theory have examined myriad characteristics of recombined knowledge and their performance implications . One feature that has received much attention is technological knowledge age . Yet , little is known about how the age of scientific knowledge influences the impact of inventions , despite the widely known catalyzing role of science in the creation of new technologies . Here we use a large corpus of patents and derive features characterizing how patents temporally search in the scientific space . We find that patents that cite scientific papers have more citations and substantially more likely to become breakthroughs . Conditional on searching in the scientific space , referencing more recent papers increases the impact of patents and the likelihood of being breakthroughs . However , this positive effect can be offset if patents cite papers whose ages exhibit a low variance . These effects are consistent across technological fields . Keywords : innovation ; knowledge recombination ; knowledge maturity ; breakthrough ; non - patent reference 2 1 . Introduction Innovation has played an important role in knowledge - based economy . It is key to productivity growth and firms’ competitive advantage ( Arora , Belenzon , & Patacconi , 2018 ; Fleming & Sorenson , 2004 ; Nelson , 1982 ) . The production of innovations has been widely theorized as a process of searching and recombining existing knowledge components ( Fleming , 2001 ; Savino , Petruzzelli , & Albino , 2017 ) . Under this viewpoint , extant literature has examined myriad types of searches for knowledge creation , like local search ( Rosenkopf & Nerkar , 2001 ) , broad search over multiple knowledge domains ( Katila & Ahuja , 2002 ; Leiponen & Helfat , 2010 ) , repeated search ( Katila & Ahuja , 2002 ) , and originality search ( Jung & Lee , 2016 ) . Studies have also related the value of innovations to various characteristics of recombined components , including technological space and geographical location ( Phene , Fladmoe - Lindquist , & Marsh , 2006 ) , organizational context ( Yang , Phelps , & Steensma , 2010 ) , and component reuse trajectories ( Kok , Faems , & de Faria , 2019 ; Wang , Rodan , Fruin , & Xu , 2014 ) . Another dimension of the search process that has also been underlined recently is the temporal one ( Katila , 2002 ) . Innovations can build upon prior knowledge that are produced at different points in time , and the literature has debated the merits of the reliance of recent versus mature knowledge on innovation productions . Recent knowledge has been emphasized as valuable ( Ahuja & Lampert , 2001 ; Mukherjee , Romero , Jones , & Uzzi , 2017 ; Nerkar , 2003 ) , as it opens avenues for new ideas and practices and helps avoid “competency traps” . Mature knowledge , on the other hand , obsoletes and loses its relevance over time . Against this so - called “recency bias” , some scholars have instead argued that mature knowledge is valuable to innovations , because it is more reliable , well understood , and tested in use ( Petruzzelli & Savino , 2014 ; Turner , Mitchell , & Bettis , 2013 ) . Despite the relevance of temporality to the search process of innovation , this line of studies has exclusively focused on temporal search in the technological space , leaving the role of temporal search in the scientific space a largely unexplored topic . Such a paucity of inquiry is surprising , given that , in a parallel stream of literature , it has been shown that scientific knowledge is also beneficial to technological development ( Ahmadpoor & Jones , 2017 ; 3 Fleming & Sorenson , 2004 ; Poege , Harhoff , Gaessler , & Baruffaldi , 2019 ) and there is a tight coupling between science and technology ( Narin , Hamilton , & Olivastro , 1997 ) . Moreover , in the private sector , firms perform less scientific research but instead continuously exploit discoveries from academia ( Arora , Belenzon , & Patacconi , 2018 ; McMillan , Narin , & Deeds , 2000 ) . Prompted by this gap , here we ask : What is the role of temporal search in the scientific space in the value of an invention ? How does this role vary across technological fields ? And how does it interact with temporal search in the technological space ? To answer these questions , we use a dataset of nearly 3 . 7 million patents granted at the U . S . Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) in a 34 - year period ( 1976 - 2009 ) to study how individual patents temporally search in the scientific space and how this type of search is related to the impact of a patent . We find that searching in the scientific space increases the impact of patents and doubles the odds of being a breakthrough . Conditional on searching in the scientific space , patents that reference more recent scientific papers have more forward citations and are more likely to become a breakthrough . However , such a positive effect can be offset if patents cite papers whose ages exhibit a low variance . Moreover , we find that both effects are consistent across technological fields . 2 . Literature review 2 . 1 . Typology of search One pivotal idea in innovation studies is that innovation results from searching and recombining prior knowledge ( Nelson , 1982 ; Schumpeter , 1939 ) . The literature has proposed various types of searches and examined their performance implications . One widely studied type is local search , defined as search in the neighbor domains of an entity’s current expertise . This mode of search has been shown to be a major strategy adopted by many firms ( Helfat , 1994 ; Stuart & Podolny , 1996 ) , and it has several advantages . Kaplan and Vakili ( 2015 ) , for example , found that it is more likely to be associated with patents that initiate new topics . Arts and Veugelers ( 2015 ) found that combining familiar knowledge in unprecedented ways is more likely to generate useful inventions , significantly increases the likelihood of breakthroughs , and reduces failure probability . Jung and Lee ( 2016 ) refined the concept of local search by emphasizing its interaction with searching original knowledge , demonstrating that originality 4 search , when incorporated into firms’ R & D , makes local search exhibit better performances to produce high - impact breakthroughs than boundary - spanning search . Implicit in local search is some notions of boundaries between knowledge domains , which have been delineated as technological , organizational , or geographical . Rosenkopf and Nerkar ( 2001 ) considered technological and organization boundaries and found that search without spanning organizational boundaries generates lower impact patents . Focusing on the social sciences fields , Schilling and Green ( 2011 ) showed that a paper’s impact is associated with drawing atypical connections between different scientific fields . Similarly , Kaplan and Vakili ( 2015 ) found that the economic value of a patent is linked to boundary - spanning search from broader technological domains . Kneeland et al . ( 2020 ) identified that distant recombination contributes to the generation of outlier patents , those distant from existing inventions . Castaldi et al . ( 2015 ) found that US state - level patenting is enhanced by recombining related technologies and unrelated ones stimulate technological breakthroughs . Turning to geographical boundaries , Phene et al . ( 2006 ) found that combining domestic knowledge that is technologically distant has a curvilinear effect on breakthrough inventions , while combining international knowledge that is technologically proximate has a positive effect . 2 . 2 . Temporal search Apart from search types mentioned above , another stream of literature has focused on search along the temporal dimension , that is , recombining knowledge inputs that are produced at different points in time . This line of studies has emphasized costs and benefits of the search and the use of recent versus old knowledge . Recent knowledge opens avenues for new ideas and practices . Ahuja and Lampert ( 2001 ) found supporting evidence that experimentations with emerging technologies help firms overcome the “maturity trap” and create breakthrough inventions . Katila and Ahuja ( 2002 ) revealed two aspects of search in robotics firms’ creation of new products : search depth , i . e . , the frequency of the use of existing knowledge , and search scope , the width of new knowledge . Nerkar ( 2003 ) found that combining recent knowledge and knowledge with large time spans is associated with the impact of patents . In a large - scale study , Mukherjee et al . ( 2017 ) explored the relationship between a patent or a paper’s impact and the age distribution of its references , finding that highly cited papers and patents are located 5 in the “hotspot” of low mean age and high age variance . Recent studies have paid attention to moderating effects on the relationship between knowledge maturity and innovation value , pointing out the roles of technological and geographical distances ( Capaldo , Lavie , & Petruzzelli , 2017 ) and the roles of firm age and size ( Petruzzelli , Ardito , & Savino , 2018 ) . Old knowledge has also been advocated as useful for knowledge creation . First , old knowledge reduces uncertainty and potential technical errors in applications ( Turner , Mitchell , & Bettis , 2013 ) , making it more reliable than newly created knowledge ( Fleming , 2001 ) . Second , old knowledge reduces its utilization costs due to its compatibility with existing knowledge , making it easy to integrate into new applications ( Petruzzelli & Savino , 2014 ) . Third , a certain level of maturity is often needed to make innovation acceptable ( Petruzzelli , Ardito , & Savino , 2018 ) , as new ideas without connections to current knowledge can encounter resistance to be recognized . In addition , the importance of some types of knowledge , like papers with delayed recognition ( Ke , Ferrara , Radicchi , & Flammini , 2015 ) , can only be appreciated after sufficient amount of time when discoveries therein are brought to light due to factors like the advancement of enabling technologies ( Cattani , 2006 ; Nerkar , 2003 ) . Overly aged knowledge , however , may lose its advantage over new knowledge . Old knowledge that has been integrated into the space of existing knowledge quickly becomes common knowledge , and inventions that embed such knowledge become less valuable ( Alnuaimi & George , 2016 ) . Moreover , old knowledge hinders individual and organizational learning ( Ahuja & Lampert , 2001 ; Katila , 2002 ) , and inventors who continuously use such knowledge may fall into “competency traps” ( Levitt & March , 1988 ) , meaning that they are not able to learn superior new knowledge and practices and innovation value generated by past knowledge markedly decreases . Furthermore , the space of old knowledge lacks recombinant opportunities ( Heeley & Jacobson , 2008 ) , leaving more room for imitation and similar ideas to competitors but less room for valuable inventions . As mentioned before , these previous studies on temporal search of inventions are limited to searching in the technological space , leaving temporal search in the scientific space an unexplored topic , which is the focus of the present work . 6 2 . 3 . Search in the scientific space Although the literature has yet to examine temporal search in the scientific space , abundant studies have investigated how technological innovations may search and rely on scientific knowledge . Just as patent references have been used to represent inventors’ search activity in the technological space , scholars have used non - patent references ( NPRs ) that refer to scientific papers to capture the reliance of patents on science . The validity of such usage has been guaranteed by surveys . For example , Roach and Cohen ( 2013 ) reported that in their survey of R & D lab managers , NPRs better represent knowledge from public research than patent references do . A series of empirical studies have repeatedly substantiated the reliance of technologies on science . Narin et al . ( 1997 ) showed that citations generated by U . S . patents to public science rapidly increased . Ke ( 2020 ) similarly found that in biomedicine , patent - to - paper citations have been growing exponentially , doubling every 2 . 9 years . McMillan et al . ( 2000 ) demonstrated that biotechnology firms’ reliance on public research is more apparent than other industries . Ahmadpoor and Jones ( 2017 ) devised a measure of citation distance between patents and papers to quantify the reliance of patents on science and found that fields like nanotechnology and computer science are closest to the technological space . Fleming et al . ( 2019 ) revealed that one third of U . S . patents depend on scientific research funded by the federal government . Another line of inquiry has proved that searching in the scientific space is beneficial to inventive activities . Fleming and Sorenson ( 2004 ) argued that the contribution of science to technological advancement is through the alternation of the search process towards more useful combinations and empirically showed that patents referencing non - patent literature receive more and a broader scope of forward patent citations . Ahmadpoor and Jones ( 2017 ) revealed that patents that are closer to science through citation relations are more impactful and valuable . Poege et al . ( 2019 ) further found that the quality of scientific papers referenced by patents has a strong positive effect on the value of technological inventions , implying that good science also leads to good technology . Taking nutrients from scientific knowledge not only promotes technological innovations but also facilitates technological breakthroughs and market values . Arts and Fleming ( 2018 ) 7 identified that the negative effect of explorative search in the technological inventing process on breakthrough outputs can be mitigated by the reliance on science . Kneeland et al . ( 2020 ) found that radical patents cite more NPRs , especially more scientific papers . Finally , Arora et al . ( 2021 ) argued that inventions’ reliance on science enhances markets for technology , and the empirical evidence indicated that patents with citations to scientific papers are considerably more likely to be traded in intellectual property transactions . Again , despite the heavily emphasized importance of science in technological innovations , surprisingly little theoretical or empirical work has examined how temporal search in the scientific space affects the value of innovations . Below we shall tackle this question . 3 . Data and methods 3 . 1 . Data We harvest patent data directly from the USPTO at its Bulk Data Storage System website ( https : / / bulkdata . uspto . gov / ) . We download bibliographic data files for patents granted from 1976 to 2019 and extract bibliographic information and backward citations , i . e . , references , of these patents . The unit of our analysis is a patent , and our sample contains 3 , 693 , 101 utility patents that are granted between 1976 and 2009 , to allow each of them to have at least 10 years to accumulate forward citations . To reliably capture the knowledge inputs of a patent , a common practice adopted in the innovation studies literature is to use its backward citations . Specifically , front - page backward citations to prior patents are used for assessing how patents rely on existing technological knowledge . Similarly , front - page NPRs that refer to scientific papers are used to assess prior scientific knowledge incorporated in the focal patent . A major difference between the two types of backward citations is that for the former , cited patents can be easily identified by patent numbers , but for the latter , only the texts of NPRs are available , without knowing if and which papers they refer to . To get the actual cited paper of a NPR , we match it with the Web of Science ( WoS ) , a comprehensive bibliographic database for scientific papers , using the algorithm developed in Ke ( 2018 ) , which has an accuracy of 97 % . From the WoS , we can retrieve various metadata of a paper , among which the most relevant one its publication year . Our sample of patents in total made 39 , 569 , 667 citations to prior patents and 3 , 433 , 070 citations to papers . 8 3 . 2 . Dependent variables We introduce two dependent variables to quantify the impact of a patent . The first one is the number of citations the focal patent has received within 10 years after its granting , i . e . , forward citation count . It is a widely accepted measure for the value of a patent ( e . g . , Capaldo , Lavie , & Petruzzelli , 2017 ; Kaplan & Vakili , 2015 ) , and has been shown to correlate well with its technical and economic importance ( Trajtenberg , 1990 ) . For robustness tests , we also consider total number of forward citations accumulated until 2019 . The second variable is a binary one that indicates whether the focal patent’s 10 - year citations is among the top 5 % clustered by patents granted in the same year and belonging to the same technological field . Here we operationalize technological field as NEBR Subcategory ( Hall , Jaffe , & Trajtenberg , 2001 ) . We also test the robustness of our results using two other thresholds ( 1 % and 10 % ) . 3 . 3 . Independent variables We construct two independent variables to measure how a focal patent performs temporal search in the scientific space . Both are based on NPRs cited in a focal patent to scientific papers . We first define the age of a cited paper as the number of years elapsed between its publication year and the grant year of the focal citing patent . We then take the average and the standard deviation of the ages of all cited papers as the tendency and spread of how the focal patent temporally searches in the scientific space , similar to what has been done when analyzing temporal search in the technological domain ( Mukherjee , Romero , Jones , & Uzzi , 2017 ; Nerkar , 2003 ) . Note that for patents without referencing any scientific papers , we set the values of both variables to 0 . 3 . 4 . Control variables We include several control variables to account for potential confounding factors . First , we control for the effects brought into play by temporal search in the technological space , as previous studies have shown that such search relates to breakthrough inventions ( Mukherjee , Romero , Jones , & Uzzi , 2017 ; Nerkar , 2003 ) . To do so , in line with prior works ( Petruzzelli , Ardito , & Savino , 2018 ) , we define the age of a cited patent as the number of years between its grant year and the grant year of the focal citing patent , and then take the average and the standard deviation of the ages of the focal patent’s referenced patents as the tendency and 9 spread of its temporal search in the technological space . Second , we consider the number of patent references , as the number of recombined components is positively associated with the value of an invention ( Kelley , Ali , & Zahra , 2013 ) . Third , the number of cited papers is similarly included . Fourth , the broadness of technological domains , as defined as the number of 4 - digit IPC patent classes , is included to account for the tendency that technologically more broad patents may be applicable for more subsequent inventions from diverse domains . Lastly , we control for the number of inventors in the focal patent . In addition , we create a dummy variable for grant year , as older patents have more time to accrue citations , and a dummy variable for technological field to account for differing rates of getting cited by field .

Results 4 . 1 . Search in the scientific space and future impact Before examining how temporal search in the scientific space affects the future impact of a patent , we first set out to understand whether searching in the space is linked to impact . Table 2 , which compares the number of forward citations of patents grouped by whether they have backward citations to papers or patents , hints that this may be indeed the case . About 87 . 5 % of patents do not cite any scientific papers , and they have an average of 8 . 33 citations in 10 years . By contrast , the remaining patents , those citing scientific papers , obtain significantly more 10 citations ( 13 . 66 ) . This result is consistent with previous studies ( Fleming & Sorenson , 2004 ) . The same effect is observed for patent references ; the vast majority ( 97 . 6 % ) of patents have at least one patent reference , and they on average receive significantly more citations than those without any patent reference . Table 2 . Impact of patents grouped by whether they have paper or patent references . Number of cited papers Number of cited patents 0 > 0 0 > 0 Number of patents 3 , 231 , 724 461 , 377 89 , 015 3 , 604 , 086 Citations 8 . 33 13 . 66 5 . 13 9 . 09 Breakthrough 0 . 048 0 . 085 0 . 029 0 . 053 Next , we employ a series of fixed effects negative binomial regressions to study the effects of search in the scientific space on the impact of patents , while controlling for search in the technological space and other confounding factors as well as the technological field and granting year effects . We use negative binomial models because our dependent variable— number of forward citations—is over - dispersed ( Table 1 ) . Table 3 reports the modeling results , indicating that search in the scientific space is positively associated with the number of forward citations . All the models in Table 3 are statistically significant , as revealed from Chi - squared tests . Model 1 is the baseline model where we only include control variables , acting as a benchmark for the remaining models . Coefficients of control variables in Model 1 are consistent with the literature : The number of inventors and the number of patent classes are positively associated with future impact . Table 3 .

The reductions of their BIC from Model 1 provide very strong support for Models 2 - 5 . Model 2 only examines search in the technological space , indicating a significant and large positive effect on citations . Patents with at least one patent reference have 51 % ( 𝑒𝑒 0 . 412 − 1 ) more forward citations than comparable patents without patent reference . Model 3 focuses on search in the scientific space , suggesting that patents with at least one SNPR have 48 . 4 % more forward citations than comparable patents without SNPR . Model 4 considers searches in both spaces , reassuring the positive associations between future impact and citing patents and papers , regardless of whether controlling for each other . The effect sizes remain similar to those in the previous two models . To further understand the effects of searches in the scientific and technological spaces , we plot in the left panel of Fig . 1 the predictive margins ( estimated citations ) of the four combinations of whether searching in the two spaces . We can see that patents with both patent references and SNPRs have the largest number of citations and that , controlling for citing patent reference , patents with SNPR have larger number of citations than those without SNPR . Model 5 further adds the interaction term to Model 4 . The positive linkage observed in the previous models persists . The statistical significance of the interaction term means that the effect of searching in the technological space on forward citations of patents is dependent on whether referencing scientific papers . The positive coefficient of the term suggests that , while 12 having patent reference is associated with higher citations than not having patent references , the difference is much bigger when the patent also has scientific paper as reference . This can be readily observed from the right panel of Fig . 1 , where we show the predictive margins . Figure 1 . Estimated forward citations based on whether searching in the technological space ( has _ pr ) and in the scientific space ( has _ snpr ) . ( left ) Based on the model without the interaction term between the two types of searches ( Model 4 in Table 3 ) ; ( right ) Based on the model with the interaction term ( Model 5 in Table 3 ) . 4 . 2 . Search in the scientific space and breakthrough inventions We further examine whether searching in the scientific space affects the likelihood of becoming a breakthrough patent , as defined as its 10 - year forward citations is within the top 5 % among patents granted in the same year and in the same technological field . Table 2 presents that for patents that do not have backward citations to papers , 4 . 8 % of them are breakthroughs , and the portion is significantly higher ( 8 . 5 % ) for patents with backward citations to papers . Table 4 reports the results from a series of logistic regression models . Model 2 indicates that searching in the technological space translates to 97 . 8 % higher odds of being a breakthrough than that for comparable patents . Model 3 suggests that searching in the scientific space is associated with a 115 % increase in the odds of becoming a breakthrough . Table 4 .

After controlling for confounders , we expect 117 % higher odds of becoming a breakthrough for patents referencing SNPR , compared to comparable patents granted in the same year and in the same technological field but without referencing SNPR . Looking at predictive margins ( estimated probabilities ) , the left panel of Fig . 2 suggests that for patents without citing prior patents , the estimated probability significantly increases from 0 . 023 to 0 . 050 when adding scientific papers as references ; for patents with citations to prior patents , the probability increases from 0 . 048 to 0 . 098 when citing papers . Model 5 further includes the interaction between searching in the two spaces . The significant , positive coefficient of the interaction term implies that the effect of citing patent references is more pronounced when the patent also cites papers . This can also be observed from the right panel of Fig . 2 that indicates that for patents without referencing papers , the probability of breakthroughs increases by 0 . 019 if they add one prior patent as a reference ; but for patents with referencing papers , doing so translates to the probability to increase by 0 . 058 . 14 Figure 2 .

Temporal search and future impact In the previous two sections , we have established that searching in the scientific space is positively linked to the future impact of a patent and the probability to be a breakthrough . In this section , we study how search along the temporal dimension can have an influence on future impact . Table 5 presents results from a series of negative binomial regressions . We have omitted the baseline model , as it has already been presented in Table 3 . Model 1 focuses on temporal search in the technological space . It shows that there is a negative association between the average age of patent references and forward citations , suggesting that citing prior patents with smaller ages—citing more recent patents—is associated with more citations . The standard deviation of patent reference ages is positively correlated with citations , meaning that citing prior patents granted in a larger timespan positively affects a patent’s forward citations . These results agree with Mukherjee et al . ( 2017 ) . Model 2 concentrates only on temporal search in the scientific space , suggesting a similar role of temporal search in the scientific space . Average SNPR age is negatively associated with forward citations , which means that citing more recent science has a positive influence on a patent’s future impact . Standard deviation of SNPR ages is positively linked to citations , which means that citing science that is temporally more spread - out translates to an increase in future impact . 15 Table 5 .

The results reveal ( 1 ) significantly negative coefficients for the average ages of cited scientific and technological knowledge ; and ( 2 ) significantly positive coefficients for the standard deviation of ages of the two types of cited knowledge . Therefore , the age structure of a patent’s recombined scientific 16 knowledge has the same effects on the impact of the patent as the age structure of its recombined technological knowledge . Looking at the effect sizes , a one - year increase of average patent reference age translates to a decrease of the log of expected citations by 0 . 0244 unit . A one - year increase of the standard deviation of patent reference ages is associated with an increase of the log of citations by 0 . 0073 unit . If a patent were to increase average SNPR age by one year , we would expect the differences in the logs of expected citations to decrease by 0 . 0131 units . A one - year increase of the standard deviation of SNPR age is linked to the log of expected citations to increase by 0 . 013 unit . To put these number in perspective , in the left panel of Figure 3 , we plot estimated citations based on different combinations of the average and standard deviation of patent reference ages , and in the right panel of Figure 3 , estimated citations based on the same two types of features derived from SNPR ages . We observe that in both figures , the region with the largest number of citations corresponds to low mean age and high standard deviation of age . Figure 3 . Estimated citations based on ( left ) mean and standard deviation of patent refence ages and ( right ) mean and standard deviation of SNPR ages . Dashed lines mark average values of corresponding variables . 4 . 4 . Temporal search and breakthrough inventions Apart from examining the extent of future impact , we also look at how temporal search in the scientific space can have effects on the likelihood of becoming a breakthrough patent , as operationalized as its forward citations in the upper 5 % for patents clustered by year and field . Table 6 demonstrates that this is the case . All models point out that the odds of being a breakthrough is negatively affected by average age of referenced knowledge and positively 17 influenced by standard deviation of ages of referenced knowledge .

Model 3 indicates that after controlling for other factors , for a one - year increase in the average age of cited patents , we expect the log odds to decrease by 0 . 0768 . For a one - year increase in the standard deviation of the ages of cited patents , the expected increase in log odds is 0 . 0361 . A one - year increase in the average age of cited papers is linked to a decrease of log odds by 0 . 0241 , and a one - year increase in the standard deviation 18 of the ages of cited papers is associated with an increase of log odds by 0 . 0287 . Translating these effect sizes into probabilities , the left panel of Fig . 4 presents the estimated probabilities of being a breakthrough based on different values of average and standard deviation of patent reference age , and the right panel estimated probabilities based on the same two types of features derived from SNPR ages . We observe again that the region with the highest probability corresponds to low mean age and high standard deviation of age . Figure 4 . Estimated probabilities of becoming a breakthrough patent based on ( left ) mean and standard deviation of patent reference ages and ( right ) mean and standard deviation of SNPR ages . Dashed lines mark average values of corresponding variables . 4 . 5 . Heterogeneity across technological fields Our modeling efforts so far have pooled all patents from different technological fields together . To further explore whether there are cross - field heterogeneities in the effects of temporal search , we repeat our analysis separately for patents belonging to the five categories designated by NBER . These categories are Chemical , Computers & Communications , Drugs & Medical , Electrical & Electronic , and Mechanical ( Hall , Jaffe , & Trajtenberg , 2001 ) , and we ignore the “Others” category , as it is a mixture of fields . Table 7 presents the results from negative binomial regressions where we still include NBER Subcategory as a fixed effect . Each model in the table focuses on patents in one NBER category . We make two observations from Table 7 . First , the negative effects of average age of cited knowledge and the positive effects of the spread of cited knowledge age are persistent across the five studied technological fields . Second , the sizes of these effects vary . For example , a one - year increase of the average age of patent references translates to a decrease of the log of expected citations by 0 . 0477 unit for 19 Computers & Communications patents and 0 . 0323 unit for Electrical & Electronic patents , both of which are larger than those of the remaining three categories . This may suggest a rapid development of modern computer - related industries—failing to rely on newly developed technologies may negatively affect the future impact of a patent . Looking at average SNPR age , their effect sizes remain relatively stable across fields . Table 7 .

The conclusions we draw from the table resonate with our previous ones . The roles of temporal search in both the technological and scientific spaces in shaping breakthroughs are consistent across fields , with the magnitude of effect sizes differing by field . Relying on recent technologies have the largest effect for Computers & Communications patents and Electrical & Electronic patents . Citing recent science have the largest effect for Drugs & Medical patents , reflecting the large literature on the deep reliance on science for this group of patents . Table 8 .

Robustness tests We perform two additional tests to ensure the robustness of our results . First , we have classified a patent as breakthrough if its 10 - year forward citation count is ranked into the top 5 % of patents grouped by year and field . We change the threshold to two other values , 1 % and 10 % , and find that our results remain robust ( Table 9 ) . Second , we have put a window of 10 years when counting citations . Our results still hold if we extend the window to 2019 ( Table 10 ) . Table 9 .

We were motivated by two streams of literature in innovation studies . The first one theorizes the production of new knowledge as a process of searching and recombining existing knowledge components and , under this theory , examines how new knowledge recombines prior knowledge elements that are produced at different points in time and how such a temporal search affects the impact of new knowledge . Past studies in this line have either used cited patents or cited papers to derive age features of recombined knowledge and have found significant roles played by knowledge of varying extent of vintage : Recombining recent knowledge and knowledge with a large span in age is linked to the impact of new knowledge ( Mukherjee , Romero , Jones , & Uzzi , 2017 ; Nerkar , 2003 ) . These past studies , however , have been constrained within the realms of science and technology separately , and so far , no studies focusing on temporal search have looked beyond the boundary . This is in sharp contrast with the second line of literature that points out a catalyzing role of science in technology development ( Fleming & Sorenson , 2004 ) . Our work therefore fills the gap by providing an evaluation of how temporal search in the scientific space is related to the future impact of inventions . Based on a large - scale corpus consisting of nearly 3 . 7 million USPTO patents granted in a 34 - year period , our first results reveal that searching in the scientific space has a positively pronounced association with the impact of patents . After controlling for confounders including searching in the technological space , patents that search in the scientific space have 48 . 9 % more forward citations in 10 years and 117 % higher odds of becoming a breakthrough than comparable patents in the same technological field and granted in the same year . Our second results indicate that , conditional on searching in the scientific space , relying on more recent science and science with a wider spread in age is associated with more patent citations and 24 higher likelihood of being a technological breakthrough . This indicates an essential tension between recency and maturity of science in temporal search : While recent science is beneficial to breakthroughs , relying only on recent science offsets such benefits . Our findings carry important implications for both innovation practitioners and policymakers . Currently searching the scientific space is still an uncommon practice , with a rather low ( 12 . 5 % ) presence of scientific references in technological inventions . However , our results indicate that such a practice may bring additional potentials that otherwise cannot be realized by focusing only on technological search . Therefore , for individual inventors , we advocate the awareness of searching the scientific space for opportunities for technological advances that may bring great citation benefits and enduring economic benefits ( Harhoff , Narin , Scherer , & Vopel , 1999 ) . Moreover , when doing so , inventors should also seek to balance recency and temporal diversity . Likewise , technology firms can exploit and learn from prior scientific knowledge . To create new products , firms can choose to directly invest in basic research , which consumes huge costs and takes a long period to translate into applied research and technology development , oftentimes with a great uncertainty . Alternatively , they may conduct applied research and instead rely on public basic science , which involves a relatively small cost and may enable the emergence of new learning opportunities . The demonstrated benefit of temporal search in the scientific space for technological breakthroughs also sheds light on science and technology policy . In particular , our results add to the increasingly stacking evidence of the applied values of science in the broader realm of technology . It is therefore important for policymakers to emphasize this link , to advocate and promote the exploitation of scientific discoveries in technology development , and to maintain the public support for science . Furthermore , our results indicate that recent science is positively associated with the future impact of patents and the likelihood of being breakthroughs , implying that it may not take long for the successful integration of science into technologies . Of a related note is that the average age of cited science is smaller than that of cited patents ( Table 1 ) . 25 We have looked at temporal search at the individual patent level . Future work can pay attention to firms and study how they perform temporal search in the scientific space and how it relates to the quantity and quality of their innovative output or other aspects of performances . In light of our work and other previous large - scale studies ( e . g . , Mukherjee , Romero , Jones , & Uzzi , 2017 ) , the roles of the age structure of prior knowledge—regardless of scientific or technological—in the impact of new knowledge seem universal , raising the questions of what possible channels are for explaining this universality and what moderators are .
