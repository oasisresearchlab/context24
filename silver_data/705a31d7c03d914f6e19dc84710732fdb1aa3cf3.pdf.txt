A RT I C L E S Engulfed cadherin ﬁngers are polarized junctional structures between collectively migrating endothelial cells Arnold Hayer 1 , 5 , Lin Shao 2 , Mingyu Chung 1 , Lydia - Marie Joubert 3 , Hee Won Yang 1 , Feng - Chiao Tsai 1 , 4 , Anjali Bisaria 1 , Eric Betzig 2 and Tobias Meyer 1 , 5 The development and maintenance of tissues requires collective cell movement , during which neighbouring cells coordinate the polarity of their migration machineries . Here , we ask how polarity signals are transmitted from one cell to another across symmetrical cadherin junctions , during collective migration . We demonstrate that collectively migrating endothelial cells have polarized VE - cadherin - rich membrane protrusions , ‘cadherin ﬁngers’ , which leading cells extend from their rear and follower cells engulf at their front , thereby generating opposite membrane curvatures and asymmetric recruitment of curvature - sensing proteins . In follower cells , engulfment of cadherin ﬁngers occurs along with the formation of a lamellipodia - like zone with low actomyosin contractility , and requires VE - cadherin / catenin complexes and Arp2 / 3 - driven actin polymerization . Lateral accumulation of cadherin ﬁngers in follower cells precedes turning , and increased actomyosin contractility can initiate cadherin ﬁnger extension as well as engulfment by a neighbouring cell , to promote follower behaviour . We propose that cadherin ﬁngers serve as guidance cues that direct collective cell migration . Identification of the mechanisms by which collectively migrating cells coordinate their movement is critical for understanding tissue development , homeostasis and disease 1 , 2 . During collective migration , individual cells typically use their autonomous migration machinery for locomotion , while being connected to their neighbours through adhesive cell – cell interactions . Rather than cells being pulled or pushed along , collective cell guidance therefore requires that neighbouring cells coordinate their direction of movement by signalling across cell – cell junctions . Previous studies have shown that vectorial signalling requires mechanical coupling between cells through cadherin - dependent cell – cell junctions 3 – 7 . Nevertheless , how symmetric cadherin cell – cell junctions can support asymmetric signal transduction by which one cell can direct the movement of its neighbour is not yet understood . In stationary epithelial and endothelial tissues , cadherin - depen - dent cell – cell junctions are smooth and morphologically distinct from serrated cell – cell junctions , also termed discontinuous , punctate or focal adherens junctions , observed during migration and junction remodelling 8 – 16 . These serrated cell – cell junctions result from mechanical tension generated by actomyosin contractility 13 , 17 and have been observed in various endothelial in vitro systems as well as in ex vivo preparations of human endothelial tissues 18 . Here we report that serrated endothelial cell – cell junctions between collectively migrating human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) are polarized relative to the direction of cell movement . We characterize their formation and structure and show that they represent membrane tubes that point away from the rear of migrating cells and are engulfed by the front of follower cells , with VE - cadherin present at the junction between the two tubular plasma membranes . We termed these engulfed structures ‘cadherin fingers’ to highlight their polarized orientation and structure . Our study suggests that cadherin fingers mediate cell guidance during collective migration .

Cells were primarily coordinated with cells at their front and rear rather than with cells at their sides ( Fig . 1d , e ) , arguing that the major coupling mechanism that mediates collective migration is between the rear of leader cells and the front of follower cells . We use the term leader cells both for cells that move into open space and for cells that have followers within a monolayer 23 . We confirmed the presence of smooth and serrated cadherin junctions across a range of cell densities from sub - confluent to densely packed , using anti - VE - cadherin antibody ( anti - CDH5 ) ( Sup - plementary Fig . 1a ) . To investigate endothelial cell – cell junctions dur - ing migration , we generated HUVECs stably expressing fluorescent protein - conjugated VE - cadherin ( HUVECs - CDH5 - mCitrine ) . Live - cell imaging revealed that collectively migrating HUVECs had ser - rated as well as smooth cell – cell junctions in the same cell . With respect to the direction of migration , smooth junctions were observed along the lateral cell boundaries , whereas serrated junctions or cad - herin fingers were mostly present in the front and rear ( Fig . 1f and Supplementary Video 2 ) . Surprisingly , we found that cadherin fingers exclusively pointed away from the back of migrating cells and overlapped with the front of their followers ; that is , they were polarized with respect to the direction of migration ( Fig . 1g and Supplementary Video 2 ) . We wounded monolayers of HUVECs to determine whether polarized cadherin fingers were also present between leader cells at the wound edge and their followers . We found polarized cadherin fingers pointing from the rear of leader cells away from the wound edge towards the cell monolayer ( Supplementary Fig . 1b , c ) . Cadherin fingers were not only oriented in cells at the wound edge , but became oriented away from the wound between internal leader and follower cells hundreds of micrometres into the cell monolayer ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) . This is consistent with a propagation mechanism whereby cells in a monolayer sequentially polarize each other , thereby promoting collective migration towards a wound , or , in intact monolayers , promote collective streaming behaviour ( Fig . 1a ) . Cadherin ﬁngers are double - membrane tubes extended from the back of leader cells and engulfed by the front of follower cells To gain insight into the structural organization of cadherin fingers , we employed three - dimensional ( 3D ) structured illumination micro - scopy ( 3D - SIM ) of F - actin - and VE - cadherin - labelled cells . Cadherin fingers extending from the rear of cells not only overlapped signifi - cantly with their follower cells , but appeared to be tightly connected to the actin cytoskeleton of both neighbours ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . This suggested that outgoing cadherin fingers extending from one cell might be engulfed by the plasma membrane of a neigh - bouring cell . We used three independent approaches to test for a potential engulfment . First , we performed mosaic cell experiments , where HUVECs expressing Ftractin - mCherry , a live - cell marker for F - actin 24 , were co - plated with HUVECs expressing CDH5 - mEGFP , and focused on cell – cell junctions between the two cell types . Strikingly , outgoing cadherin fingers were marked by actin bundles that were surrounded by CDH5 - mEGFP - positive membranes from the follower cell ( Fig . 2b ) . This arguesthatoutgoingcadherinfingersinthebackofleadercellscontain actin bundles , with the back plasma membrane of the leader cell being engulfed by the front plasma membrane of the follower cell . Second , we used field - emission scanning electron microscopy ( FE - SEM ) to visualize cell – cell junctions in HUVEC monolayers . FE - SEM confirmed this striking topology by showing that finger - like protrusions extending from the presumed leader cell were engulfed by the follower cell ( Fig . 2c ) . In control correlated light and electron microscopy experiments , where we directly registered SEM and fluorescence microscopy data , we found that the sites of tubular membrane engulfment visible in SEM corresponded to the cadherin fingers we characterized by fluorescence microscopy ( Fig . 2d ) . Third , due to their proposed asymmetric structure , tubular cad - herin fingers should expose a convex or positively curved surface in thefrontoffollowercells , andaconcaveornegativelycurvedsurfacein thebackofleadercells . Indeed , whenwecomparedthelocalizationofa protein domain that selectively binds to positive membrane curvature in living cells ( AMPH - BAR , Fig . 2g ) 25 , 26 with that of a plasma mem - brane marker , AMPH - BAR was enriched at the surface of incoming cadherin fingers in the front and depleted from the surface of outgoing cadherin fingers in the rear ( Fig . 2e – h ) . This ∼ 3 - fold enrichment is consistent with an engulfed tubular structure of cadherin fingers and shows that cadherin finger membranes are suﬃciently curved to selectively recruit curvature - sensitive regulatory proteins , providing a potential mechanism for vectorial signal propagation during collective migration . An increased localization of an F - BAR domain protein to focal adherens junctions has recently been reported in support of the hypothesis that curved membranes can be associated with cadherin - dependent cell – cell junctions 27 . Control experiments showed that cadherin fingers did not co - localize with the focal adhesion marker paxillin ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) , confirming previous reports for serrated cell – cell junctions 13 . We also found that neither cellular extensions in cadherin finger junctions nor intercellular bridges fused the cytoplasms or plasma membranes of neighbouring cells together , since neither a soluble ( Ftractin - mCherry ) nor a membrane marker ( CDH5 - mEGFP ) were exchanged between neighbouring cells expressing those markers ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) , confirming previous reports 11 . Together , these data argue that cadherin fingers are double - plasma - membrane tubes wherein the tubular membrane from a leader cell is engulfed by plasma membrane of the neighbouring follower cell . Live - cell imaging showed thatindividual cadherin fingers are dynamic structures , increasing and decreasing in length and with a mean half - life of ∼ 13min ( Supplementary Fig . 1d and Supplementary Video 3 ) . However , while individual cadherin fingers dynamically grow and shrink , the polarized orientation of an ensemble of cadherin fingers at the interface between leader and follower cells remained the same relative to the direction of movement during collective migration ( Supplementary Video 2 ) . A cadherin / catenin - based link between cells is required for cadherin ﬁnger formation and coordinated cell migration , but not for autonomous migration Mechanical coupling between collectively migrating cells has been shown to require classical cadherins , associated intracellular α and β catenins as well as actomyosin contractility 28 – 30 .

( a – d ) HUVECs were transfected with either control siRNA ( siCNTRL ) or siRNA targeting α - catenin ( siCTNNA1 ) , the cytoplasmic actin adaptor of the cadherin / catenin complex . Depletion of α - catenin caused a loss of polarized cadherin ﬁngers , impaired coordinated cell movement , and accelerated single - cell velocity .

Furthermore , actomyosin contractility was also needed to maintain cadherin fingers , as inhibition of Rho - associated kinase ( ROCK ) , a mediator of actomyosin contractility ( using 20 µ M Y27632 ) , converted cadherin fingers into smooth junctions ( Fig . 3i , j ) 13 . Using averaged pairwise velocity correlation as a metric , α - catenin depletion , overexpression of CDH5 - (cid:49) β cat , and ROCK inhibition not only caused a loss of cadherin fingers but also , in parallel , a strong decrease in cell – cell coordination ( Fig . 3c , d , g , h , k , l ) .

Together , these studies confirm that both cadherin finger formation as well as coordinated movement require mechanical coupling between VE - cadherin and actin as well as actomyosin contractility . Furthermore , this shows that cadherin fingers are not required for cells to polarize or migrate autonomously , and supports the hypothesis that cadherin fingers have instead a role in orienting cells and coordinating collective migration . Polarization of cadherin ﬁngers requires continued Arp2 / 3 - driven actin polymerization and asymmetric actomyosin contractility Since engulfed cadherin fingers are present in the front of migrating follower cells , where Arp2 / 3 drives protrusive actin polymerization , we tested whether Arp2 / 3 activity is required for cadherin finger formation and maintenance . Acute treatment with the Arp2 / 3 inhibitor CK666 ( 200 µ M ; ref . 31 ) caused immediate shrinking of cadherin fingers and , within 15min , most had disappeared or lost polarized orientation ( Fig . 4a and Supplementary Video 4 ) . In addition , cell migration ceased ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . Similarly , acute treatment with the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 ( 20 µ M ) to reduce myosin II activity caused cadherin fingers to shrink rapidly ( Fig . 4a and Supplementary Video 4 ) . When cells were treated with thrombin ( 1Uml − 1 ) , a potent activator of myosin II activity , cell – cell junctionsbecamemoreserrated , asreportedpreviously 13 . However , an intriguing observation was that the finger - like structures in thrombin - treated cells lost their polarized orientation and now pointed both ways ( Fig . 4a and Supplementary Video 4 ) . This argues that Arp2 / 3 - driven actin polymerization and actomyosin contractility are needed both for polarized cadherin finger formation and for maintenance . This also suggests that contractility must be spatially asymmetric for cadherin fingers to form , as a uniform increase in contractility leads to a loss in polarized cadherin finger orientation . To test for gradients in actomyosin contractility during collective migration , we compared actomyosin activity in the rear of leader cells and the front of follower cells in two ways . First , we used an antibody to detect activated , phosphorylated myosin II regulatory light chain ( pMLC ) . We classified cell – cell junctions into smooth , asymmetric serrated , and symmetric serrated junctions ( Fig . 4b ) . By comparing pMLC localization in the two regions on adjacent sides of cell – cell junctions , we found that pMLC showed a high local gradient at asymmetric serrated cell – cell junctions but was symmetrical at both smooth and symmetric serrated cell – cell junctions . Markedly , pMLC antibody staining was depleted near incoming cadherin fingers in the cytoplasm of follower cells , arguing that actomyosin contractility must be low in this region ( Fig . 4c , d ) . Second , we generated a stoichiometric F - actin and myosin II activity reporter construct based on fluorescently tagged Ftractin and myosin II regulatory light chain ( MLC ) that we expressed equally as two proteins from the same messenger RNA ( Fig . 4e ) . MLC is diﬀusely cytoplasmic when inactive , but forms puncta along actin filaments when activated 32 . Comparing fluorescent signals of MLC and Ftractin in low - density HUVEC cultures showed a strong depletion of myosin II activity in regions of active lamellipodia protrusions ( Supplementary Video 5 ) . Furthermore , consistent with theresultsobtainedbyimmunofluorescenceandanti - pMLCantibody , myosin II activity was locally depleted from the same front regions of collectively migrating cells where cadherin fingers were present ( Fig . 4f – h and Supplementary Fig . 3b – d and Supplementary Videos 6 and 7 ) . Individual cells within a collectively migrating monolayer have previously been shown to be intrinsically polarized with their ‘frontness’ defined by frequent local lamellipodium - like protrusions ( ‘cryptic lamellipodia’ 33 ) . The zone of low actomyosin contractility near incoming cadherin fingers at the front may allow such cryptic lamellipodia to form to direct forward movement . Presence and orientation of cadherin ﬁngers correlate with local edge dynamics and predict cell turning To better understand a potential role of cadherin fingers in cell guidance , we followed three strategies to determine the dynamic relationship between cadherin fingers , local membrane protrusion , and cell turning . First , we performed mosaic culture analysis with cells expressing either fluorescently tagged CDH5 or the F - actin marker Ftractin . Both 3D - SIM and live - cell widefield - fluorescence microscopy revealed that cadherin fingers co - localized with cryptic lamellipodia of follower cells that protrude forward below the cadherin fingers , along the adhesion surface ( Fig . 5a , b ) . The close spatial association between cadherin fingers and cryptic lamellipodia suggests that they may form a functional unit important for directed migration . Second , we quantitatively related the presence and orientation of cadherin fingers to the rate of membrane protrusion by automatically identifying incoming and outgoing cadherin fingers and correlating their presence to local cell edge velocity . Local edge velocities and cadherin finger orientation and presence were measured over 60 min on the basis of segmentation of individual CDH5 - mCitrine - expressing cells in CDH5 - mCitrine / CDH5 - mRuby3 mosaic monolayers ( Fig . 5c , d and Supplementary Video 8 ) . Markedly , the presence of incoming cadherin fingers closely correlated with local protrusion rates , whereas outgoing cadherin fingers correlated with local retraction rates ( Fig . 5e – g and Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . The close spatio - temporal correlation between incoming cadherin fingers and local membrane protrusion provides support for a role of newly formed cadherin fingers in directing protrusions and thereby mediating collective cell guidance . Third , we determined whether cadherin fingers may have a role in redirecting follower cells or in mediating cell turning by focusing on a subpopulation of cells that spontaneously exhibited significant turning behaviour in unperturbed monolayers . We tracked CDH5 - mCitrine - expressing HUVECs with their nuclei stained with Hoechst and selected turning cells on the basis of their nuclear trajectories ( Fig . 6a ) . For the selected cells , we monitored the presence and location of cadherin fingers before and during the turning process and related them spatially and temporally to the associated nuclear trajectories ( Fig . 6b , c and Supplementary Fig . 5a , b ) . Cross - correlation analysis of the left – right bias of incoming cadherin fingers compared with cell turning revealed that the abundance of cadherin fingers increases on the side of a cell towards which a cell will turn ∼ 12min before the cell actually turns ( Fig . 6d and Supplementary Fig . 5b , c and Supplementary Video 9 ) . The finding that cadherin fingers are induced in follower cells before they turn is consistent with the 1316 © (cid:400)(cid:398)(cid:399)(cid:406)(cid:613) Macmillan Publishers Limited (cid:422)(cid:613)(cid:47)(cid:31)(cid:49)(cid:51)(cid:613)(cid:46)(cid:36)(cid:613)(cid:21)(cid:47)(cid:49)(cid:40)(cid:45)(cid:37)(cid:35)(cid:49)(cid:613)(cid:15)(cid:31)(cid:51)(cid:52)(cid:49)(cid:35) .

Together , a potential turning mechanism mediated by cadherin fingers and low myosin activity is reminiscent of a guidance mechanism in mesenchymal cells , where localized inactivation of myosin II at the leading edge has been shown to correlate with chemotaxis towards growth factor 34 . Increased contractility in leader cells triggers polarized cadherin ﬁnger formation and engulfment by follower cells To understand how cadherin fingers may direct local protrusions during collective migration , we investigated how cadherin fingers are formed and oriented between cells .

A future follower cell may induce leader behaviour in a neighbour 35 by increasing actin polymerization and lamellipodia extension to engulf cadherin fingers ( model ( i ) , Fig . 7a ) . Alternatively , afutureleadercellmayincreaseactomyosincontractility and trigger formation of outgoing cadherin fingers to induce follower behaviour in a neighbour ( model ( ii ) , Fig . 7b ) . To distinguish between these models , we induced either protru - sive actin polymerization or actomyosin contractility in individual cells in a monolayer . This was done by synthetically activating Rac or Rho GTPases through translocation of FKBP - conjugated Rac or Rho GEF domains to the plasma membrane by rapamycin - induced heterodimerization with a plasma membrane - localized Lyn 11 - FRB ( Fig . 7c ) 36 . Transient co - transfection of HUVECs stably express - ing CDH5 - mCitrine with the membrane anchor Lyn 11 - FRB and ei - ther mCherry - FKBP - GEF ( TIAM1 ) , a Rac GEF , or mCherry - FKBP - GEF ( ARHGEF1 ) , a Rho GEF , resulted in mosaic monolayers of trans - fected and untransfected cells .

Scoring the number of incoming and outgoing cadherin fingers along the periphery of transfected cells , before and 10min after ad - dition of rapamycin , showed that Rac activation did not change the number of incoming cadherin fingers , arguing against a model that follower cells can induce leader behaviour in a neighbouring cell by activating membrane protrusion ( Fig . 7d , e and Supplementary Video 11 ) . Nevertheless , Rac activation and increased lamellipodia protrusion led to an overall decrease in outgoing cadherin fingers , arguing that local Rac activation can strengthen existing follower be - haviour in the front and weaken leader behaviour in the back ( Fig . 7e ) . In contrast , increased actomyosin contractility through activa - tion of Rho , increased the number of outgoing cadherin fingers ( Fig . 7f ) with incoming cadherin fingers frequently ‘flipping’ outwards ( Fig . 7f , g and Supplementary Video 12 ) . This argues that Rho activa - tion can promote engulfment of cadherin fingers by a neighbour . We used two additional approaches to corroborate this result . First , we monitored cell – cell junctions between interphase cells and cells at the onset of mitotic cell rounding , an event where cells naturally experience increased actomyosin contractility 37 – 39 . The results were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to synthetic Rho activation ( Fig . 8a , b and Supplementary Video 13 ) . Second , we used local optogenetic activation of Rho through light - induced translocation of ( PDZ ) 2 - mCherry - GEF ( LARG ) to the plasma membrane - localized Stargazin - GFP - LOVpep ( Fig . 8c ) 40 . Locally increased contractility through local Rho activation using 445nm laser stimulation resulted in an increased number of outgoing and a loss of incoming cadherin fingers ( Fig . 8d and Supplementary Video 14 ) . Together , these results argue for the second model ( Fig . 7b ) , in which polarized cadherin finger formation can be initiated 1320 © (cid:400)(cid:398)(cid:399)(cid:406)(cid:613) Macmillan Publishers Limited (cid:422)(cid:613)(cid:47)(cid:31)(cid:49)(cid:51)(cid:613)(cid:46)(cid:36)(cid:613)(cid:21)(cid:47)(cid:49)(cid:40)(cid:45)(cid:37)(cid:35)(cid:49)(cid:613)(cid:15)(cid:31)(cid:51)(cid:52)(cid:49)(cid:35) .

The follower cell responds to support cadherin ﬁnger engulfment and extends local cryptic lamellipodia . ( f ) Leader – follower cell relationships are maintained by cadherin ﬁngers that leaders extend from their rear and followers engulf in their front . Incoming cadherin ﬁngers may bias the autonomous migration machinery of follower cells to follow the leader by favouring local protrusion events .

We show that serrated cell – cell junctions , here termed cadherin fingers , are polarized , engulfed cadherin and membrane structures that connect the front and rear of collectively migrating en - dothelial cells . Cadherin fingers are double - plasma - membrane tubes with one plasma membrane extending from the rear of a leader cell to be engulfed by the plasma membrane of its follower cell , through VE - cadherin - mediated cell – cell adhesion ( Fig . 8e – g ) . We confirmed the existence of this engulfed structure using both 3D - SIM light and scanning electron microscopy . We show that with respect to the direction of migration , cadherin fingers point outward from the rear of cells towards their followers , both in streams of collectively migrating cells in unperturbed monolayers , and during wound heal - ing . We confirmed the opposite curvature characteristic of the mem - brane tubes in leader and follower cells using a live - cell BAR domain curvature reporter . 3D - SIMalsoshowedthatVE - cadherinincadherinfingersisdeeply connected to the actin cytoskeleton of leader and follower cells , suggesting that both cells contribute to the formation of cadherin fingers . While present on both sides , the contractile actomyosin structures are distinct in both cells , with actomyosin contractility being high in the back of leader cells , and low in a narrow zone with cadherin fingers in the front of follower cells . Actomyosin contractility is probably needed on both sides of the zone with low actomyosin activity to mechanically anchor the cadherin finger structure . We found a requirement of cadherin / α / β - catenin complexes , myosin II - mediated contractility , and Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin poly - merization for cadherin finger formation and maintenance . Using chemical and optogenetic strategies to acutely induce either protrusive actin polymerization or actomyosin contractility in individual cells or cell regions , we directly showed that increased contractility in future leader cells , but not protrusive lamellipodia extension in follower cells , can initiate cadherin finger formation in a neighbour . Thus , our study is consistent with a model where cadherin finger formation is a sequential process that starts in a monolayer with locally increased contractility in the future leader cell . Actomyosin contractility has previously been shown to mediate locally curved plasma membrane structures and may provide an initial membrane curvature asymmetry 26 . Extension of outgoing membrane tubes and engulfment of incoming cadherin fingers by follower cells may then occurinparallelinaprocesspoweredbyArp2 / 3 - drivendendriticactin polymerization and rearward moving actin structures ( ‘treadmilling’ ) in the front of follower cells 15 , 16 . Such a process may link the formation of outgoing cadherin fingers from a leader cell to the local protrusion of cryptic lamellipodia in a follower cell . Our finding that formation and orientation of cadherin fingers can be propagated from one cell to the next suggested that cadherin fingers mediate or stabilize leader – follower cell relationships . We were intrigued to find that when cells turn within the monolayer , incoming cadherin fingers became laterally enriched at the side of the front towards which cells were going to turn ∼ 12min later . A guidance role for cadherin fingers was also suggested by molecular perturbations that caused a correlated loss of cadherin fingers and coordinated cell movement , without aﬀecting the autonomous polarization and migration of individual cells ( Fig . 3 ) . Thus , cadherin fingers have a likely role in locally biasing a follower cells’ autonomous polarity signalling processes and thereby reorienting the polarity of the follower cell . By then directing the next follower cell , cadherin fingers may act as serial guidance signals for collective migration . To serve as an instructive guidance cue , the asymmetry of the cadherin finger structure has to be converted into an asymmetric signalling response that is distinct between the rear of leaders and front of followers . We hypothesize that the opposite orientation of membrane curvature on incoming and outgoing cadherin fingers could bias the localization of curvature - sensing proteins to create asymmetry in signalling . Such a role of curvature - sensitive proteins is plausible as we found a ∼ 3 - fold polarized enrichment of a curvature - sensing BAR domain along the surface of incoming cadherin fingers compared with outgoing cadherin fingers . Of note , only a relatively small asymmetry of regulatory proteins might be suﬃcient to orient cells as they have an autonomous capacity to polarize . Asymmetric curvature sensing provides a compelling mechanism of how polarity might be propagated from leader to follower cells if the formation of cadherin fingers is paralleled by a polarized recruitment of proteins with curvature - sensing domains that can suppress actomyosin contractility , induce actin polymerization , and promote cadherin finger engulfment ( Fig . 8g ) . Future studies will aim at identifying curvature - specific regulators that may control these processes in endothelial cells . Together , our study introduces cadherin fingers as polarized , engulfed structures that support collective polarization during collective endothelial cell migration . Our data suggest that cadherin fingers provide instructive structural cues needed to direct endothelial follower cells during collective migration . Such a mechanism is reminiscent of local chemoattractant cues that can direct and polarize solitary neutrophils and Dictyostelium discoideum 43 , 44 , where , in contrast to endothelial cells , guidance is achieved independently of mechanical coupling between cells . Serrated cell – cell junctions have been observed in a variety of epithelial and endothelial cell types and cadherin finger - mediated polarity signalling between cells may therefore be a general mechanism supporting tissue - level organization of cells .

Primary HUVECs ( Lonza , C2519A ) were cultured in EGM2 ( Lonza CC - 3162 ) . hTERT - immortalized HUVECs ( HT - HUVECs ) were generated by transduction of HUVECs with lentivirus encoding hTERT - IRES - hygro followed by hygromycin selection ( 50 µ gml − 1 ) . HUVECs stably expressing fluorescent reporter constructs were derived from HT - HUVECs by lentiviral transduction followed by either FACS sorting or antibiotics selection ( 0 . 5 µ gml − 1 puromycin , 10 µ gml − 1 blasticidin ) . 293T cells ( not authenticated ) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS and 1 % GlutaMAX ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . The HEK293TcelllineusedforlentivirusproductionisintheICLAClistofmisidentifiedcelllines . However , none of our conclusions relies on the identity of the HEK293T cells . The absence of mycoplasma contamination in cell cultures was routinely verified using a PCR test 45 . Antibodies and reagents . Mouse monoclonal anti - CDH5 was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories ( 610252 , used at 1 : 400 ) , rabbit polyclonal anti - phospho - myosin light chain 2 ( Ser19 ) from Cell Signaling Technology ( 3671S , used at 1 : 400 ) , rabbit monoclonal anti - paxillin from Abcam ( ab32084 , used at 1 : 250 ) . Phalloidin conjugated to FITC and Alexa Fluor dyes , secondary antibodies , and Hoechst 33342 were from Thermo Fisher Scientific , CK666 from Sigma - Aldrich ( SML0006 ) , Y27632 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( sc281642 ) , thrombin from Sigma - Aldrich ( T4648 ) , rapamycin from LC Laboratories ( R - 5000 ) , and bFGF from R & D Systems ( 223 - FB ) . DNA constructs and lentivirus production . Selected plasmid constructs generated for this study along with detailed sequence information will be available from Addgene soon after publication ( http : / / www . addgene . org / Tobias _ Meyer ) . CDH5 ( human , VE - cadherin ) was PCR amplified from HUVEC - derived cDNA and TOPO - cloned into pENTR / D - TOPO . CDH5 - mCitrine and CDH5 - mEGFP were generated by LR recombination using the custom - made Gateway destination vectors pmCitrine - N - DEST / TO and pmEGFP - N - DEST / TO , respectively . CDH5 - mEGFP and CDH5 - mCitrine were then transferred , following PCR amplification , into pCAGEN ( Addgene no . 11160 ) as EcoRI / XhoI fragments . For pLenti - CDH5 - mCitrine - IRES - puro , CAG - CDH5 - mCitrine was released and ligated as a SalI / NotIfragmentintoacustom - madeandXhoI / NotI - digestedpLenti - MCS - IRES - puro . pLenti - CDH5 - mRuby3 - IRES - puro was generated by releasing mCitrine from pLenti - CDH5 - mCitrine - IRES - puro as an AgeI / NotI fragment and replacing it with mRuby3 ( ref . 46 ) , provided by M . Lin ( Stanford University , USA ) , by Gibson assembly 47 . For pLenti - CDH5 - mEGFP , CAG - CDH5 - mEGFP was first subcloned into pENTR1A - noCCDB ( Addgene no . 17398 ) as a SalI / XhoI fragment , and then transferred by LR recombination into pLenti - X1 - puro - DEST ( Addgene no . 17297 ) . To overexpress VE - cadherin with the cytoplasmic β - catenin - binding site deleted ( CDH5 - (cid:49) β cat ) , we used a construct similar to tailless VE - cadTS 48 , but based on human VE - cadherin ( encoding VE - cadherin amino acids 1 – 669 , C - terminally tagged by TS - mod , featuring mTFP1 and mVenus fluorescent tags ) . pLenti - Ftractin - mCherry was generated by PCR amplification of Ftractin - mCherryinpEGFP - N1 ( ref . 49 ) andligationintoCSII - EF - MCS ( providedbyX . Liu , University of Colorado , USA ) as XhoI / NotI fragment . pLenti - mTurquoise - MLC - IRES - neo was constructed by PCR amplification of human MLC ( myosin II regulatory light chain , MYL9 ) from a HUVEC cDNA library , PCR amplification of mTurquoise , and Gibson assembly into custom - made , BamHI and EcoRI - digested pLenti - EF1a - MCS - IRES - neo . The stoichiometric myosin II / F - actin activity reporter consisted of cDNA encoding Ftractin - mCherry followed by a Gly - Ser - Gly linker , a P2A ribosomal skipping sequence 50 , and mTurquoise - MLC ( MYL9 ) . Low expression of the reporter was achieved through a 5 (cid:48) upstream ORF ( ACCATGGGTTGAACC , uORF 51 ) . Ftractin - mCherry was PCR amplified from Ftractin - mCherry in pEGFP - N1 ( ref . 49 ) , and mTurquoise - MLC from pLenti - mTurquoise - MLC - IRES - neo . The 5 (cid:48) uORFandtheP2AsequenceswereintroducedduringPCRandbothfragmentswereGibson - assembled into custom - made , BamHI and EcoRI - digested pLenti - EF1a - MCS - IRES - blast .

Crabtree , Stanford University , USA ) . For AMPH - BAR - mCherry , human Amphiphysin1 ( AMPH1 , human ORFeome v5 . 1 ) was used as a template to PCR - amplify the BAR domain ( amino acids 1 – 256 ) . The product was digested and ligated into a EcoRI / AgeI - digested pCAGEN containing mCherry , resulting in AMPH - BAR - mCherry . Lyn 11 - FRB and CFP - CAAX have been described previously 36 , 43 . mCherry - FKBP - GEF ( TIAM1 ) , clonedintopCAGEN , includedmCherry , FKBP , and the DH domain of human TIAM1 ( amino acids 1012 – 1250 ) . The DH - PH domain of TIAM1 potently activates Rac activity when translocated to the plasma membrane 53 ; here the isolated DH domain of TIAM1 was used to further reduce the basal GEF activity of the construct in the absence of rapamycin . mCherry - FKBP - GEF ( ARHGEF1 ) wasanalogouslyconstructed , butincludedtheGEFdomain ( amino acids 380 – 630 ) of ARHGEF1 ( p115 RhoGEF ) , a Rho - specific RhoGEF 54 . Constructs for optogenetic activation of RhoA , Stargazin - GFP - LOVpep and ( PDZ ) 2 - mCherry - DH ( LARG ) were a gift from M . Glotzer and E . Wagner ( University of Chicago , USA ) and have been described previously 40 . Lentivirus was generated in HEK293T cells co - transfected with the third - generation packaging plasmids pMDLg / pRRE , pRSV - rev , pCMV - VSVG ( provided by X . Liu , University of Colorado , USA ) using Lipofectamine 2000 ( ref . 55 ) , and a transfer vector containing the gene of interest . Viral supernatants collected at 48h and 72h post transfection were pooled , 0 . 22 µ m - filtered , and concentrated using centrifugal filter units ( 100kDa cutoﬀ , Millipore , UFC910024 ) . siRNA transfections and high - throughput cell motility assay . siRNA pools targeting YFP ( control ) or α - catenin ( CTNNA1 ) were generated as described previously 56 . Briefly , ∼ 600bp regions of targeting genes were amplified by PCR ( Supplementary Table 1 ) and in vitro transcribed , using T7 polymerase and T7 - flanked PCR products as templates . Double - stranded in vitro transcription products were diced in vitro using in - house - made Giardia dicer ( provided by M . Teruel , Stanford University , California , USA ) and purified . Optical 96 - well plates , either plastic - bottom ( Corning 3904 ) , or glass - bottom ( Cellvis , P96 - 1 . 5H - N ) , were pretreated with 31 µ gml − 1 bovine collagen ( Advanced BioMatrix , 5005 - B ) in PBS at 37 ◦ C for 1h or 16h , respectively . HUVECs ( 10 4 per well ) , suspended in 80 µ l antibiotics - free EGM2 , were reverse - transfected with siRNAs diluted in 20 µ l OptiMEM to a final 20 nM and using 0 . 25 µ l Lipofectamine RNAiMAX . The transfection mix was replaced with EGM2 after 6 – 9h . At 50 – 60h post transfection , Hoechst was added to the medium at 200ngml − 1 for 1h to stain nuclei . The medium was replaced with imaging medium ( EGM2 buﬀered with 20mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 ) , plates were sealed with adhesive tape , and time - lapse series wereacquiredat1frameper10minusinga4 × objectiveandtheDAPIchannelofan automated fluorescence microscope ( ImageXpress Micro XL , Molecular Devices ) . Cell tracking and motility analysis . Segmentation of cell nuclei and tracking were performed using custom - written MATLAB routines . The rationale , algorithm and code have been described before 56 , 57 . In brief , the nuclei of individual cells were identified using a modified Otsu’s method 58 . To monitor the moving trace of each nucleus , the nuclei identified at each time frame were linked on the basis of the nearest - neighbour method . If mitosis happened , one of the daughter cells was directly linked to the mother cell . The other was assigned a new number , and its correlation with the mother cell was saved in a separate file . Cell velocity was determined on the basis of nuclear displacements between subsequent time points ( 10min interval ) , averaged over 10 time points . Coordinated cell movement was quantified on the basis of averaged pairwise velocity correlation between individual cells and their neighbours using the equation : V ( r ) = 1 N N (cid:88) i = 1   1 n n (cid:88) j = 1 v i · v j | v i | | v j |   where N represents the number of cells migrating at velocity v i , and n represents the number of their neighbours within radius r = 100 µ m , migrating at velocity v j ( Fig . 1b ) . Frontandrearneighboursofagivencellwerethosecellswithin r = 100 µ m whose nuclei were within a 60 ◦ sectors ahead or behind , centred around , v i ; lateral neighbours the remaining cells within r = 100 µ m ( Fig . 1d ) . Fixed and live - cell imaging . HUVECs were plated on chambered coverslips ( LabTek ) or glass - bottom 96 - well plates coated with collagen as described above . Cells were fixed by adding fixation solution ( 4 % formaldehyde , 10mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , in PBS ) at a ratio of 1 : 1 to culture medium ( final 2 % formaldehyde ) . After 15min the fixation solution was removed , cells were washed with PBS , followed by incubation in permeabilization / blocking solution ( 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 10 % FBS , 1 % BSA , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 , in PBS ) for 30min , and stained with appropriate primary / secondary antibodies diluted in permeabilization / blocking solution . Fixed cells were imaged overlaid with PBS , live cells were imaged in EGM2 buﬀered with 20mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 or extracellular buﬀer ( ECB , 125mM NaCl , 5mM KCl , 1 . 5mM MgCl 2 , 1 . 5mM CaCl 2 , 10mM D - glucose ) supplemented with 1 % FBS and 5ngml − 1 bFGF , and plates were kept sealed during imaging .

ImagesshowninFigs4a , 7and8 , andSupplementaryFig . 2bandSupplementary Videos 3 , 4 and 11 – 14 , were acquired using a fully automated widefield / Yokogawa spinning - disc confocal fluorescence microscope system ( Intelligent Imaging Innovations , 3i ) , built around a Nikon Ti - E stand , equipped with Nikon 40 × 1 . 3NA oil and 60 × 1 . 27 NA water - immersion objectives , an Olympus 60 × 1 . 35 NA oil immersion objective , a 3i laser stack ( 405 , 442 , 488 , 514 , 561 , 640nm ) , a 3i ‘Vector’ photomanipulation device , an epifluorescence light source , ( Sutter Lambda XL ) , a Yokogawa CSU - W1 scanning head with dual camera port , two sCMOS cameras ( Andor Zyla 4 . 2 ) , enclosed by an environmental chamber ( Haison ) , and controlled by SlideBook software ( 3i ) .

Figures2a , band5aandSupplementaryFig . 2a , cwereacquiredusinga3Dstructured illumination microscope ( see below ) . 3D structured - illumination microscopy ( 3D - SIM ) . 3D - SIM imaging was performed using a Zeiss Axio Observer . Z1 inverted microscope outfitted with a structured - illumination apparatus 60 , in which a spatial light modulator ( SLM ) was used as a phase grating . The sub - millisecond image - loading speed of the SLM allows high - speed SIM pattern switching and live 3D imaging 60 . Raw images were collected using a 63 × 1 . 2 NA water - immersion objective . Images of the two colour channels were recorded on two sCMOS cameras ( ORCA Flash 4 . 0 , Hamamatsu ) , each with dedicated emission filters in front so as to eliminate the time spent between channel switching . The colour channel was switched between every z plane to ensure concurrency between the two channels . Image registration between the two cameras was performed using the UCSF Priism software . Reconstructed 3D - SIM images were generated from the raw data as described previously 61 . Transient transfections of cDNA . For transient transfection of cDNA , 1 . 5 · 10 4 HUVECs per well were plated the day before transfection in glass - bottom 96 - well plates coated with collagen as described above . The day of the transfection , the culture medium was replaced with antibiotics - free EGM2 , 80 µ l per well . Then , 0 . 2 µ g DNA and 0 . 25 µ l Lipofectamine2000 ( Life Technologies ) , diluted in 20 µ l OptiMEM , was added following the manufacturer’s protocol . This transfection mix was replaced after 2h with EGM2 and cells were analysed 16 – 24h later . Scanning electron microscopy . For SEM analysis , cells cultured on 12mm glass coverslips were fixed for 24h at 4 ◦ C with 4 % formaldehyde and 2 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1M sodium cacodylate buﬀer ( pH 7 . 2 ) , rinsed in the same buﬀer and post - fixed for 1h with 1 % aqueous OsO 4 . After dehydration in an ascending ethanol series ( 50 , 70 , 90 , 100 % ( 2 × ) ; 10min each ) samples were critical point dried with liquid CO 2 in a Tousimis Autosamdri - 815B apparatus ( Tousimis ) , mounted with colloidal graphite on 15mm aluminium stubs ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) , and sputter - coated with 50Å of gold - palladium using a Denton DeskII Sputter Coater ( Denton Vacuum ) . Visualization was performed with a Zeiss Sigma FE - SEM ( Carl Zeiss Microscopy ) operated at 2kV , using inLens SE detection at working distance 4 – 5mm . Images were captured in TIFF using 2 , 048 × 1 , 536 pixels store resolution andalineaveragingnoisereductionalgorithm . Forcorrelativefluorescenceelectron microscopy , HUVECs - CDH5 - mCitrine plated on film grid - indexed coverslips ( Pyser - SGI Limited , CMC34A ) were first fixed using formaldehyde ( 4 % , 10mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , in PBS ) and imaged in PBS using a 20 × 0 . 75 NA Fluar air objective at 0 . 32 µ m pixel resolution . Samples were subsequently fixed with 4 % formaldehyde and 2 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1M sodium cacodylate buﬀer ( pH 7 . 2 ) and prepared for SEM as described above . Tiled fluorescence images were stitched together using the Grid / Collection stitching Plugin 62 in FIJI 63 and used as a reference during SEM acquisition . Coordinated cell movement as a function of cell density and confluence . To determine confluence and coordinated cell movement as a function of cell density , HT - HUVECs were plated at increasing densities ( 0 . 25 × 10 4 to 2 . 5 × 10 4 per well ) in glass - bottom 96 - well plates coated with collagen ( see above ) . Twenty - four hours later , cells were stained with Hoechst and imaged for 2 . 5h at 10min intervalsusingtheHoechstchannelandthe4 × objectiveofanautomatedwidefield - fluorescence microscope to monitor cell motility ( ImageXpress Micro XL , see above ) . Subsequently , cells were fixed , stained using FITC - phalloidin , anti - VE - cadherin antibody , and images were acquired using a 20 × 0 . 75 NA objective ( 0 . 32 µ m pixel resolution ) and widefield - fluorescence illumination . Raw images were background - subtracted and thresholded . Confluence was computed as area covered by thresholded FITC - phalloidin signal divided by total area and expressed as a function of cell density , which was determined by the number of segmented cell nuclei per area . Coordinated cell movement was computed on the basis of nuclear trajectories as described above and averaged over ten subsequent time points . Data shown in Fig . 1c , e are pooled from three independent experiments . Cadherinfingerlocationrelativetocellmovement . HT - HUVECs - CDH5 - mCitrine were plated at 10 4 cells per well of a glass - bottom 96 - well plate coated with collagen ( seeabove ) . Twenty - fourhourslater , cellswerestainedwithHoechst ( seeabove ) and imagedusinganautomatedwidefield - fluorescencemicroscope ( ImageXpressMicro XL , seeabove ) , a20 × 0 . 75NAobjective ( 0 . 32 µ mpixelresolution ) , at4minintervals , usingboththeHoechstandYFPchannels . Cellmovementwasautomaticallytracked on the basis of nuclear trajectories and the location of incoming and outgoing cadherin fingers along the cellular periphery was determined semi - automatically . The orientation of cadherin fingers relative to the direction of cell movement was computed as the angular diﬀerence between the vectors connecting the nuclear centroidandthelocationofcadherinfingersandthevectorofnucleardisplacement . Data shown in Fig . 1g are from n = 522 randomly selected cells , assessing the orientation of 2 , 519 incoming and 2 , 173 outgoing cadherin fingers , pooled from three independent experiments . Edge velocity tracking and segmentation of cadherin fingers . To facilitate cell segmentation and edge velocity tracking , mosaic monolayers with HT - HUVECs - CDH5 - mCitrine and HT - HUVECs - CDH5 - mRuby3 , plated at a ratio 1 : 10 , were used . Time - lapse sequences were acquired at 1min intervals for 2h , using a 40 × 1 . 3 NA objective ( 0 . 16 µ m pixel resolution ) and epifluorescence illumination . For analysis , we focused on individual CDH5 - mCitrine - expressing cells that were surrounded by CDH5 - mRuby3 - expressing cells . Edge velocity tracking was performed as follows . The cell body , and thus cell edges , were defined by a combination of intensity thresholding and edge - detection on the CDH5 - mCitrine signal . For each frame , 50 markers were equally spaced along the cell boundary and shifted to minimize the median distance from the markers in the previous frame . This method enabled continuous tracking of markers and uniform spatial samplingofthecelledge . Cadherinfingersweresegmentedasfollows . Toaccentuate the cadherin at the border of the mCitrine - expressing cell , the product of the CDH5 - mCitrine and CDH5 - mRuby3 images was calculated . Thresholding of local enrichment followed by skeletonization yielded an initial set of lines corresponding to areas of enriched cadherin , and lines proximal to the cell border were isolated for further processing . Branch points were removed , lines were broken into linear segments , proximal co - linear segments were connected , and only segments tangential to their proximal cell border were retained . Finally , the direction of the cadherin fingers was inferred by assuming that the image signal proximal to the tip of cadherin fingers is lower than the image signal proximal to the base of the cadherin fingers . Cadherin finger location and cell turning . To analyse the spatio - temporal relationship of incoming and outgoing cadherin fingers during cell turning events , we focused on the small but consistent fraction of cells in confluent monolayers of HUVECs that spontaneously underwent significant turning . HT - HUVECs - CDH5 - mCitrine were plated at 10 4 cells per well of a glass - bottom 96 - well plate coated with collagen ( see above ) . Twenty - four hours later , cells were stained with Hoechst ( see above ) and imaged using an automated widefield - fluorescence microscope ( ImageXpress Micro XL , see above ) , a 20 × 0 . 75 NA objective ( 0 . 32 µ m pixel resolution ) , at 4min intervals for 4h , using both the Hoechst and YFP channels . To identify turning cells , convex hulls were generated using each cells’ nuclear trajectories and sorted according to the area of the convex hulls . Subsequently , the location of incoming and outgoing cadherin fingers along the cell periphery was determined semi - automatically and their orientation relative to cell movement determined . Foreachtimepointandseparatelyforincomingandoutgoingcadherin fingers , a lateral bias was computed as the mean angular deviation between the vectors connecting the nuclear centroid and cadherin fingers . The angular bias was computed such that for both incoming and outgoing cadherin fingers , a positive lateral bias indicated more cadherin fingers on the left , and a negative lateral bias more cadherin fingers on the right . No lateral bias by either incoming or outgoing cadherin fingers indicated that cadherin fingers of each kind were either distributed equally between the right and the left , or no cadherin fingers were present . Cell turning for each time point t 0 was computed as the interpolated change in direction of nuclear displacement vectors connecting the nuclear locations at t − 2 , t 0 and t 0 , t 2 . Tofacilitatecomparisonbetweenright - andleft - turningcells , valuesforturningand angular bias were mirrored along the axis of movement for right - turning cells , so that all right - turning cells became left - turning cells .

All rights reserved (cid:421) M E T H O D S DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncb3438 finger bias and cell turning was performed . To this end , traces for cell turning and cadherin finger bias were aligned to the time of maximum turning for each cell , and cross - correlation analysis was done using the xcorr function in MATLAB . Myosin II activity profiles in migrating cells . Myosin II activity was analysed in mosaic cultures of HT - HUVECs expressing CDH5 - mCitrine alone and HT - HUVECs coexpressing CDH5 - mCitrine and the stoichiometric F - actin / myosin II activity reporter Ftractin - mCherry - P2A - mTurquoise - MLC . Cells were plated at 2 × 10 4 cells per 96 - well plate , at a ratio of 1 : 10 of cells expressing the Ftractin - mCherry - P2A - mTurquoise - MLCreporter / cellsnotexpressingthereporter . Twenty - four hours later , time - lapse sequences of unperturbed mosaic monolayers were acquired using an automated widefield - fluorescence microscope ( ImageXpress Micro XL , see above ) , a 20 × 0 . 75 NA objective ( 0 . 64 µ m pixel resolution ) , acquiring mTurquoise / mCitrine / mCherry channels at 5min intervals . Cells were tracked over 45min ( 10 time points ) , masked on the basis of the Ftractin - mCherry signal , and the front – back profiles of the ratio mTurquoise - MLC / Ftractin - mCherry were computed on the basis of background - subtracted images and a 6 - pixel ( 3 . 84 µ m ) - wide peripheral ring . For each cell analysed , the front – back profiles were averaged over ten consecutive time points to yield one MLC / Ftractin profile per cell . The lengthofallprofileswasnormalized ( front – back ) tofacilitatecomparisonofprofiles between many cells . Myosin II polarity across junctions . To measure polarization of pMLC antibody signal near cell – cell junctions , images of fixed cells co - stained with VE - cadherin and pMLC antibodies were taken using a 20 × 0 . 75 NA objective and widefield - fluorescenceillumination . Junctionalsegmentswerefirstclassifiedaseithersmooth , serrated asymmetric , or serrated symmetric on the basis of VE - cadherin antibody signal . Then , for each junction segment a pair of ROIs was drawn on opposite sides of cell – cell junctions and the mean fluorescence intensity of pMLC within the two ROIs was measured ( FI ROI1 and FI ROI2 ) . For each pair of ROIs , the polarization of pMLC signal was then computed using the following equation : pMLC polarization = FI ROI1 − FI ROI2 1 2 ( FI ROI1 + FI ROI2 ) For serrated asymmetric junctions , ROI1 was on the donor side and ROI2 on the acceptor side of cadherin fingers . For serrated symmetric and smooth junctions , ROI1 was the ROI with FI ROI1 > FI ROI2 to warrant a conservative estimate of asymmetric pMLC localization when the polarity of the junction was unknown . Response of cadherin finger abundance to synthetic activation of Rac , Rho , and increased contractility during the onset of mitotic cell rounding . Synthetic Rac or RhoactivationwasachievedbycontransfectingHT - HUVECs - CDH5 - mCitrinecells with the membrane anchor Lyn 11 - FRB and either mCherry - FKBP - GEF ( TIAM1 ) or mCherry - FKBP - GEF ( ARHGEF1 ) and inducing plasma membrane translocation of mCherry - FKBP - GEFbyaddingrapamycin ( 100 – 500nM ) . Thenumberofincoming andoutgoingcadherinfingerspercellbeforeand10min ( Rac ) or15min ( Rho ) after the addition of rapamycin was counted . For synthetic Rho activation , only cells that responded to the addition of rapamycin by increased contractility , and that retained contacts with their neighbours until the end of the experiment , were selected for analysis . To monitor the number of incoming / outgoing cadherin fingers before and after onset of mitotic cell rounding , HT - HUVECs - CDH5 - mCitrine were imaged at 1min intervals , and the number of incoming and outgoing cadherin fingers per cell was counted after the onset of mitotic cell rounding ( but before cells detached form their neighbours ) and 8min before . Local optogenetic Rho activation . HUVECs - CDH5 - mCitrine were transiently co - transfected with constructs encoding membrane - anchored LOVpep ( Stargazin - GFP - LOVpep ) and ( PDZ ) 2 - mCherry - GEF ( LARG ) ( ref . 40 ) , the photorecruitable DH domain of LARG , a RhoA GEF , at a ratio 5 : 1 . Rho activity was locally stimulated in transfected cells by 455nm light in small regions using a ‘Vector’ photomanipulationdevice ( 3i ) . Laserpowerwastunedto10 % , rasterblocksizesetto 40 , anddwelltimeto0 . 5ms . Time - lapsesequencesof60frames , using515nmlasers for excitation , were acquired at 30s intervals and photostimulation was performed 10 times , at 30s intervals , at frames 11 – 21 . The contractile response of cells to photostimulation ranged from weak local retractions to rapid cell rounding and detachment , depending on expression levels of the transfected constructs and cell morphology . Cells showing a moderate local contractile response were selected for Fig . 8 . BAR domain enrichment / depletion analysis on incoming / outgoing cadherin fingers . Enrichment or depletion of AMPH - BAR - mCherry on the surface of cadherin fingers was measured in HT - HUVECs stably expressing CDH5 - mCitrine and transiently co - transfected with AMPH - BAR - mCherry and the curvature - insensitive membrane marker CFP - CAAX . Images of live cells expressing all three markers were taken using a 63 × 1 . 2 NA objective and widefield - fluorescence illumination . Images were background - subtracted and incoming or outgoing cadherin fingers were identified on the basis of the CDH5 - mCitrine signal . Regions of interest ( ROIs ) were drawn around individual cadherin fingers and mean fluorescence intensities within ROIs were determined for the AMPH - BAR - mCherry and CFP - CAAX channels . The ratio between AMPH - BAR - mCherry and CFP - CAAX in each ROI was calculated and normalized by their ratio in peripheral regions of each cell to account for unequal relative expression levels of the two markers in diﬀerent cells . Statistical analysis and reproducibility . Parametric and non - parametric statistical tests to compare diﬀerences between groups , as indicated in the figure legends , were selected as appropriate for the data distribution ( normal , non - normal , as by the Shapiro - Wilk test ) , for the number of groups , and for paired or unpaired measurements .

COM / NATURECELLBIOLOGY 7 Supplementary Video Legends Supplementary Video 1 Coordinated movement of HUVEC in monolayers depends on cell density . HUVEC plated at low and high density were stained with Hoechst and imaged using widefield fluorescence microscopy ( 4x , 0 . 2 NA ) at 10 min intervals for 4 h . Streams and swirls of coordinately moving HUVEC can be seen in high - density cultures ( right , 792 cells / mm2 , coordination score 0 . 24 ) , but not in low - density cultures ( 274 cells / mm2 , coordination score 0 . 07 ) . Scale bar , 200 µm . Displayed at 15 fps . Supplementary Video 2 Polarized cadherin fingers at the interface between collectively migrating cells . A monolayer of HUVEC stably expressing CDH5 - mCitrine was wounded and collective migration was monitored using widefield fluorescence microscopy ( 20x , 0 . 75 NA ) at 5 min intervals . Cadherin fingers extending from the rear of migrating cells are highlighted by circles . Scale bar , 20 µm . Displayed at 3 fps . Supplementary Video 3 Dynamics and half - life of cadherin fingers . HUVEC stably expressing CDH5 - mCitrine were imaged at 1 min intervals using widefield fluorescence microscopy ( 40x , 1 . 3 NA ) . The life - time of individual cadherin fingers ranges from minutes to hours . Scale bar , 10 µm . Displayed at 10 fps . Supplementary Video 4 Loss of polarized cadherin fingers in cells treated with the Arp2 / 3 inhibitor CK666 , the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 , or Thrombin . HUVEC stably expressing CDH5 - mCitrine were subjected to live - cell imaging ( 40x 1 . 3 NA , 1 min intervals ) and were either control - treated or treated with CK666 ( 200 µM ) , Y27632 ( 20 µM ) , or Thrombin ( 1U / ml ) after the first 5 frames . In CK666 and Y27632 - treated cells the number of cadherin fingers decreases after drug addition . Thrombin treatment causes serrated , symmetric cell - cell junction . Scale bar , 10 µm . Displayed at 5 fps . Supplementary Video 5 The stoichiometric F - actin / myosin II activity reporter Ftractin - mCherry - P2A - mTurquoise - MLC . In HUVEC stably expressing the reporter , and plated at low density , mTurquoise - MLC is depleted from protrusions , indicating depletion of myosin II activity from protrusive actin networks . Acquired at 5 s intervals , displayed at 8 fps . Scale bar , 10 µm . Supplementary Video 6 Depletion of myosin II activity in the front of follower cells . HUVEC stably expressing Ftractin - mCherry - P2A - mTurquoise - MLC were imaged at 5 s intervals . At the interface between the leader ( top ) and the follower cell ( bottom ) , mTurquoise - MLC is depleted in the front of the follower cells . Acquired at 15 s intervals , displayed at 8 fps . Scale bar , 10 µm . Supplementary Video 7 Depletion of myosin II activity in the front of collectively migrating cells .

Supplementary Video 8 Automated tracking of presence and orientation of cadherin fingers . HUVEC stably expressing CDH5 - mCitrine were imaged at 1 min intervals using widefield fluorescence microscopy ( 40x , 1 . 3 NA ) . Automatically detected incoming ( green ) and outgoing ( red ) cadherin fingers are shown . Scale bar , 10 µm . Displayed at 8 fps . Supplementary Video 9 Incoming cadherin fingers accumulate laterally prior to cell turning . A monolayer of HUVEC stably expressing CDH5 - mCitrine ( white ) was stained with Hoechst ( blue ) and imaged at 4 min intervals using widefield fluorescence microscopy ( 20x , 0 . 75 NA ) . The video focuses on a turning cell . The nuclear trajectory and incoming cadherin fingers ( + ) are marked . Incoming cadherin fingers accumulate laterally and predict the direction of cell turning . Scale bar , 20 µm , displayed at 8 fps . Supplementary Video 10 Outgoing cadherin fingers follow turning . The same turning cell as in video 9 is shown . The nuclear trajectory and outgoing cadherin fingers ( + ) are marked . Outgoing cadherin fingers do not predict the direction of cell turning .

HUVEC stably expressing CDH5 - mCitrine and transiently transfected with Lyn11 - FRB and mCherry - FKBP - GEF ( TIAM1 ) were imaged live using a 40x 1 . 3 NA objective and at 20 s intervals . Rapamycin was added after frame 7 to synthetically activate Rac and induce protrusive actin polymerization . Increased Rac activity was insufficient to increase the number of incoming or outgoing cadherin fingers . Scale bar , 10 µm , displayed at 5 fps . Supplementary Video 12 Increased contractility through synthetic Rho activation is sufficient to induce outgoing cadherin fingers . HUVEC stably expressing CDH5 - mCitrine and transiently transfected with Lyn11 - FRB and mCherry - FKBP - GEF ( TIAM1 ) were imaged live using a 40x 1 . 3 NA objective and at 1 min intervals . Rapamycin was added after frame 5 to synthetically activate Rho and induce actomyosin contractility . Increased Rho activity was sufficient to induce outgoing cadherin fingers , while incoming cadherin fingers were lost . Scale bar , 10 µm , displayed at 5 fps . Supplementary Video 13 Increased contractility at the onset of mitotic cell rounding is sufficient to induce outgoing cadherin fingers . HUVEC stably expressing CDH5 - mCitrine were subjected to live - cell imaging , using a 40x 1 . 3NA objective and at 1 min intervals . The increased contractility in the cell undergoing mitotic cell rounding causes a loss of incoming cadherin fingers , but initiates formation of outgoing cadherin fingers between itself and its neighbors . Scale bar , 10 µm , displayed at 5 fps . Supplementary Video 14 Local optogenetic Rho activation induces outgoing cadherin fingers . HUVEC stably expressing CDH5 - mCitrine were transiently transfected with Stargazin - GFP - LOVpep and ( PDZ ) 2 - mCherry - GEF ( LARG ) .
