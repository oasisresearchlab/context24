A strain expressing both Myo5 - GFP and Arp2 - DsRed ( RLY1975 ) was grown as in ( A ) and analyzed by making double - color time - lapse movies .

Dynamics of Yeast Myosin I 1607 patch lifespan in the myo5 E901A mutant strain is due to a delayed completion of a Myo5 - dependent function . To examine the effects of the myo5 E901A mutation on the dynamics of the Arp2 / 3 complex , two - color mov - ies were made of a (cid:1) myo3 (cid:1) myo5 strain expressing Myo5 E901A - GFP and Arp2 - DsRed at 30 (cid:2) C . In the mutant cells , many patches never exhibited colocalization of Myo5andArp2andthereforemightbeabortive / aberrant structures ( Movie 5 ) . We reasoned that the primary de - fect in these cells could be found by analyzing patches to which both proteins localized and showed all phases of movement . While the myo5 E901A mutation had no effect on the rate of Arp2 fast movement , the slow movement phase of Arp2 was clearly prolonged in the mutant with an average duration of 15 . 9 (cid:3) 5 . 6 s ( n (cid:4) 100 ) compared to 9 . 4 (cid:3) 2 . 3 s ( n (cid:4) 100 ) in the wild - type . Student’s t test showed that this difference was highly statistically significant ( t (cid:4) 10 . 738 and p (cid:5) 0 . 0001 ) . Representative graphs of movement of individual Arp2 patches in the wild - type and the mutant are shown in Figure 3D . These plots also show that the Arp2 patches in the mutant often moved back and forth during their slow phase as though they were under force but unable to detach . These results suggest that a dysfunctional Myo5 leads to a delay in the initiation of the fast - movement phase of the Arp2 / 3 complex . To further examine the functional significance of the abnormal patch dynamics in the myo5 E901A mutant , fluid phase endocytosis was assayed in these mutants with lucifer yellow ( LY ) . Whereas wild - type cells efficiently internalized and accumulated LY in the vacuole , LY up - take was drastically reduced in the mutant cells at 30 (cid:2) C Figure 3 .
