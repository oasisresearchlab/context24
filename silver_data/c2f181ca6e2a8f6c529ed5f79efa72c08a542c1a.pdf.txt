Factors influencing the Covid - 19 mortality rate in the European Union : importance of medical professionals Javier Cifuentes - Faura University of Murcia , Spain Email : javier . cifuentes @ um . es This paper has not been previously published and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Factors influencing the Covid - 19 mortality rate in the European Union : importance of medical professionals ABSTRACT Objective : The aim of this paper is to analyze whether health variables such as total number of physicians , available beds and public spending on health care influence the number of deaths . The influence of other variables such as the Human Development Index and public health measures is also analyzed . Study design : Statistical study . Evaluation of variables associated with Covid - 19 mortality in the EU Methods : A multiple regression analysis is performed for the countries of the European Union . Results : Health expenditure , public health measures and the number of physicians influence the total number of deaths . The more physicians , the lower the number of deaths . However , the number of beds or the Human Development Index are not determinants of the number of deaths . Conclusions : A greater number of medical professionals will improve health care and reduce the number of deaths . Keywords : Covid - 19 ; physicians ; health expenditure ; number of beds ; public health measures . INTRODUCTION A new coronavirus outbreak , known as SARS - CoV - 2 emerged on December 31 , 2019 in Wuhan , ( China ) , spreading rapidly throughout the world [ 1 ] . According to data provided by Johns Hopkins University there are more than 99 . 7 million infected with the virus and more than 2 . 14 million deceased as of January 26 , 2021 . The most common symptoms produced by Covid - 19 are fever , cough , shortness of breath [ 2 ] and in some cases decreased or loss of smell and taste [ 3 ] . The virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets released when a person with the virus coughs , sneezes or speaks [ 4 ] . The infection can become complicated and produce respiratory problems and severe chest symptoms , leading to acute pneumonia [ 5 , 6 ] . Elderly people are at highest risk of coronavirus lethality [ 7 ] . The coronavirus has also called into question whether countries have the necessary tools to deal with the pandemic . Given the great expansion of the virus , the collapse of many hospitals and the considerable increase in the number of infected and dead , it is important to carry out a study to determine whether variables such as the number of physicians , public spending on health care or the number of hospital beds available have a significant influence on the total number of deaths due to Covid - 19 . The main objective of this work is to determine whether various health variables have a significant influence on the total number of deaths per million inhabitants in the countries of the European Union . The aim is also to know whether countries with a J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f greater number of public health measures or restrictive policies ( which do not indicate effectiveness ) have had fewer deaths due to coronavirus . In addition , we included the Human Development Index ( HDI ) , an indicator created by the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) to determine the degree of progress of each country taking into account health , economic and educational factors , and which could have an impact on the number of deaths [ 8 ] . METHODOLOGY A multiple linear regression was carried out , with the dependent variable being the total number of deaths per million inhabitants ( Mortality ) . The independent variables included health variables such as the total number of physicians per 100 , 000 inhabitants ( Physicians ) , available beds per 100 , 000 inhabitants ( Beds ) and public spending on health ( Health Expenditure ) as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) . These variables were obtained from the Eurostat database . We have also considered the HDI , information provided by the World Bank , and the restrictive policies imposed by the countries ( Policies ) , measured through the Government Response Stringency Index [ 9 ] , obtained from One World Data . This index shows the level of stringency or harshness of the policies implemented by the various countries , but does not imply that they are effective . It is based on nine response indicators , including school closures , workplace closures or travel bans , and can take a value from 0 to 100 ( 100 = most stringent ) . The information on the data concerning Covid - 19 refers to cases accumulated up to the second week of January 2021 . The equation to be estimated is as follows : ̂ + RESULTS Mortality rates vary considerably among the countries analyzed . The highest incidence is in Belgium ( 1 , 709 . 27 per million population ) and the lowest in Finland ( 106 . 26 per million population ) . The highest public health expenditure , expressed as a percentage of GDP , is in Germany ( 11 . 47 % ) and the lowest in Luxembourg ( 5 . 29 % ) . Germany has the highest number of beds per 100 , 000 inhabitants ( 800 . 23 ) and Sweden the lowest ( 213 . 79 ) . Greece has the most medical professionals per 100 , 000 inhabitants ( 561 . 81 ) , while Poland has the fewest ( 257 . 47 ) . Ireland has the highest HDI ( 0 . 955 ) and Bulgaria the lowest ( 0 . 816 ) . The highest Government Response Stringency Index is that of Italy ( 87 . 96 ) and the lowest is that of Croatia ( 41 . 67 ) , with the average for the European Union countries standing at 68 . 58 . This indicates that the most restrictive measures have been those imposed by Italy . The multiple regression analysis ( Table 1 ) shows that the level of restriction of the policies adopted by governments ( at 10 % ) , health spending ( at 5 % ) and the total number of physicians ( at 10 % ) have a significant influence on the Covid - 19 mortality rate . If we look at the value of the standardized coefficients , health spending is the variable with the greatest influence . Table 1 . Multiple regression model .

More physicians contribute significantly to lower rates of Covid - 19 deaths . The more medical professionals in healthcare , the more personalized care can be given to Covid - 19 infected patients . On the other hand , those countries that have allocated greater economic resources ( more healthcare expenditure ) to the healthcare system have had higher death rates , coinciding with the results of the work of Khan et al . at the global level [ 10 ] . The number of deaths due to Covid - 19 has not been determined by the fact that less income has been allocated to the health care system , but perhaps by an irregular redistribution of these economic resources , where there has been a low recruitment of health care personnel . On the other hand , despite the collapse of some hospitals , the number of beds does not influence the number of deaths . The opening of new floors with beds or the creation of field hospitals has allowed the continued care of patients infected with coronavirus . However , the lack of personnel has had an impact on the number of deaths , so it will be necessary for governments to hire more health personnel to deal with the pandemic and prevent the number of deaths from continuing to grow . In addition to these health variables , there is a positive relationship between the severity of restrictive measures and the number of deaths . This is explained by the fact that in countries where the incidence of the virus has been lower , it has not been necessary to implement such a restrictive policy as in those where the number of deaths and infected persons grew exponentially at a very worrying rate . The HDI , which , among other things , provides information on the degree of health progress of a country , is not a determining factor in estimating the number of deaths . CONCLUSIONS The spread of Covid - 19 has affected the European continent with great virulence . For this reason , in this work we have analyzed , by means of multiple regression , whether various health variables influence the number of deaths due to Covid - 19 in the countries of the European Union . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f It was found that the number of medical professionals has a significant influence and that the greater the number of professionals , the lower the number of deaths . Health expenditure is important in order to allocate more money to the purchase of medical equipment , respirators and resources . However , it has been proven that the redistribution of these resources is not being adequate . The expenditure or budget earmarked for the health sector should make it possible to hire more health personnel , so that more and better services can be offered to those infected . However , in many cases the number of staff hired is insufficient for the large number of people affected . Restrictive measures ( closure of schools or essential activities ) are needed to help contain the pandemic . Even so , those countries with more restrictive measures have had a higher number of deaths due to their high incidence of cases . This paper warns of the importance of having sufficient numbers of medical professionals to deal with the pandemic . Human resources are almost more important than economic resources , and the recruitment of a greater number of healthcare professionals will allow more effective care of patients infected with coronavirus , and as a consequence , the number of deaths can be slowed down . Therefore , it is necessary that the redistribution of resources is done in an effective way , and that the budget and expenditure allocated to public health is used , in part , for the recruitment of health personnel .
