Chang and Joel Moss From the Molecular Mechanisms Section , Laboratory of Cellular Metabolism , National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Maryland 20205 When intact mouse neuroblastoma NB cells were incubated with choleragen at 4 “C , washed , and incu - bated at 37 “C , activation of adenylate cyclase occurred rapidly after a delay of 15 min . The cells were incubated under the same conditions with ‘261 - labeled toxin , lysed , and solubilized with sodium dodecyl sulfate under mild conditions . Soluble proteins were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence of dithiol reductants to separate labeled toxin products . Initially , only 0 . 1 to 0 . 2 % of the cell - associated radioactivity migrated on the gels as the AI peptide of choleragen . After a 15 - min delay , the amount of AI peptide increased rapidly with time and paralleled the activation of adenylate cyclase . Similar results were observed with human skin fibroblasts , Friend erythroleukemic cells , and I13 - a - N - acetylneuraminosyl - gangliotetraosylceramide - treated rat glioma C6 cells . When toxin - treated NB cells were incubated at increas - ing temperatures , generation of A1 peptide and activa - tion of adenylate cyclase increased in parallel . Both processes were prevented by incubation of cells at 4 or at 37 “C in the presence of anticholeragen antibodies . These results indicate that there is delay both in the formation of AI peptide and in the activation of ade - nylate cyclase in intact cells . As AI is believed to be the catalytically active component of choleragen , it is sug - gested that the lag period may be related in part to the time required to generate A1 peptide from choleragen . The mechanism of action of choleragen has been intensively investigated for the last decade . The toxin is composed of two different subunits , A and B ( 1 ) . It is generally accepted that the B subunit , which consists of five identical peptides ( 2 - 4 ) , binds to specific receptors , the ganglioside GM ~ ’ , on the cell surface ( reviewed in Ref . 5 ) . The A subunit , which consists of two peptides linked by a single disulfide bond , is involved in the activation of adenylate cyclase ( 6 - 10 ) .

It was subsequently shown that AI is an ADP - ribosyltransferase ( 7 ) that catalyzes the transfer of ADP - ribose from NAD to subunits of the guanine nucleotide regulatory component of the adenylate cyclase system ( 8 , 9 ) . This modification leads to a persistent activation of the cyclase . In contrast to the rapid increase in cyclase activity obtained in membranes ( 6 , lo ) , choleragen activates adenylate cyclase in intact cells only after a discrete delay ( 6 , 11 - 13 ) . It has been postulated that during this delay the A subunit is translocated across the membrane and re - duced to form AI ( 2 , 5 ) . In a preliminary report , we described the generation of Al from choleragen in intact cells ( 14 ) . In the present study , we relate the formation of AI by intact cells to the activation of adenylate cyclase . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials - Choleragen , from Schwan / Mann , was iodinated as described previously ( 14 ) ; the specific activity was 40 - 50 pCi / pmol and 80 % of the label was in the A component . Anticholeragen anti - bodies were a generous gift from Dr . William Habig , Bureau of Biological Standards , 1 ml precipitated 140 pg of toxin . Cells and Cell Culture - Rat glioma C6 and Friend erythroleu - kemic cells were cultured as described previously ( 15 ) . Mouse neu - roblastoma NB41A cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were cultured as described elsewhere ( 13 ) . Human diploid skin fibroblasts were obtained and cultured as de - scribed previously ( 16 , 17 ) . All studies were done on cells cultured in 35 - mm wells of multicluster trays unless otherwise indicated . Friend cells were incubated in suspension . Where indicated , C6 cells were treated with Ghll ( 1 p ~ for 30 min ) as described previously ( 13 ) . Activation and Assay ofAdenylate Cyclase - Cells were incubated in 1 ml of serum - free medium buffered with 25 m ~ 4 - ( 2 - hydroxy - ethyl ) - 1 - piperazineethanesulfonic acid and containing 0 . 01 % bovine serum albumin , 10 mi choleragen at 4 “C for 30 min . The cells were washed with ice - cold phosphate - buffered saline and incubated in fresh medium as described in the various tables and figures . The cells were either assayed for intracellular cAMP ( 1 m ~ isobutylmethylxan - thine was included in the medium ) as described previously ( 13 , 17 ) or assayed for adenylate cyclase activity in the presence of 50 p ~ GTP ( 17 ) . Results for cAMP represent the mean of values from duplicate samples each assayed in triplicate and variations were usually less than 10 % of the mean . Results for adenylate cyclase activity represent the mean of triplicate assays which varied less than 5 % . Generation of A , and Analysis by SDS - Polyacrylamide Gel Elec - trophoresis - Cells were incubated with 10 nM ‘251 - choleragen ( 50 - 150 cpm / fmol ) , washed , and incubated in fresh medium as described above . At the appropriate times , the cells were washed in ice - cold phosphate - buffered saline , detached by scraping ( except the Friend cells ) , and collected by centrifugation . In the initial studies , the cells were lysed , dissolved by adding SDS to 1 % , and analyzed on 12 . 5 % SDS - polyacrylamide slab gels ( 14 ) . As described in the text , there was a large amount of nonspecific formation of Al . In order to reduce this 12148 Role of A I Peptide in Choleragen Action on Intact Cells 12149 background , the cell incubations were stopped by adding 1 ml of ice - cold 10 m ~ N - ethylmaleimide in the phosphate - buffered saline . The cells were lysed as described before ( 14 ) in a small volume of 10 mM Tris - HC1 ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 0 . 25 mM MgCl , , 0 . 1 % DNase I , 2 m phenylmeth - ylsulfonyl fluoride . After 7 min at 20 " C , the lysates were adjusted to 2 % SDS , 2 mM N - ethylmaleimide , 20 % glycerol , 0 . 001 % bromphenol blue and applied to the gels . After the gels were run , stained with Coomassie blue , and destained , they were sliced into 1 - mm sections and counted for lZ5I on a Beckmann Gamma 4000 . Choleragen and choleragen reduced with dithiothreitol were run on each slab gel . 20 40 M MINUTES . L FIG . 1 .

Portions ( 100 , - OOO cpm ) were applied to SDS slab gels along with reduced and unreduced choleragen . Radioactivity was detected by autoradiogra - phy . " BPB RESULTS When choleragen - treated NB cells were shifted from 4 to 37 " C , intracellular cAMP began to increase after a delay of 20 min ( Fig . L4 ) and adenylate cyclase activity after a delay of 15 min ( Fig . 1B ) . Parallel studies were done with cells treated with 1251 - choleragen . Initially , between 1 and 2 % of the cell - associated radioactivity was AI and this increased with time ( data not shown ) . As these values were much higher than the 0 . 5 % initially observed with macrophages ( 14 ) , we attempted to prevent " background " reduction of the toxin during cell lysis by adding N - ethylmaleimide to the cells ? The presence of AI in cells incubated with ' 251 - choleragen at 4 " C may be due to some reduction of A during cell lysis and sample TABLE I Effect of treatment of rat glioma C6 cells with & I on responsiveness to choleragen and generation of AI Rat glioma C6 cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 " C with or without 1 p ~ GMI and washed three times .

The cells then were assayed for cAMP or AI content as described under " Experimental Procedures . " The control cells bound 30 , 500 cpm of toxin of which only 20 % ( 40 fmol ) was specific ( not inhibited by 1 p ~ unlabeled choleragen ) .

This reduced the initial amount of AI to less than 0 . 5 % of the total radioactivity bound to the cells . The increase in A1 now closely paralleled the increase in adenylate cyclase activity ( Fig . 1 0 . Similar results were obtained with Friend erythro - leukemic cells ( Fig . 2 ) and ( & - treated rat glioma C6 cells and human fibroblasts ( data not shown ) . The proportion of bound toxin converted to A1 after 1 h at 37 " C varied with the cell type ; it was as low as 1 . 2 % in human fibroblasts and as much as 6 % in NB cells . Under the conditions that the cells were lysed and dissolved in SDS , a large fraction of the labeled toxin did not dissociate into its subunits ( Fig . 3A ) . When the samples were heated at 65 " C for 5 min before being applied to the gels , the toxin was effectively dissociated but the amount of A , observed at zero time was increased ( Fig . 3B ) . The net amount of AI formed by the cells during the 1 - h incubation did not increase . Similar results were observed when the samples were heated at 37 " C or boiled . As reported by Gill ( 2 ) , acid treatment effectively dissociated the toxin into its subunits ; again , the amount of A1 was not increased ( data not shown ) . During the time of activation of adenylate cyclase by choleragen , there was no detectable degradation of the toxin subunits ( Fig . 4 ) . Even after 1 h at 37 " C , 99 % of the cell - associated radioactivity was precipitated by trichloroacetic acid ( Fig . 4A ) . These same results were obtained with NB cells in monolayer or with Friend cells ( Fig . 4A ) or NB cells in suspension ( data not shown ) . Under the latter conditions , any degradation products released into the medium also would have been detected . When the cell - associated material was analyzed on SDS gels under reducing conditions , only labeled A1 and B were de - tected ( Fig . 4B ) . As the amounts of AI being formed were very small , the possibility that it arose from toxin that was nonspecifically bound to the cells had to be considered . We compared GMI - treated C6 cells with untreated cells ( Table I ) . The GMI - treated cells bound 1Sfold more total toxin and all of this increased binding was specific ( 13 ) . As expected ( 13 ) , the GMI - treated cells exhibited a greater increase in cAMP production in response to choleragen . In addition , the amount of AI formed by these cells was very much greater than that ob - served in the control cells ( Table I ) . Since the amount of choleragen nonspecifically bound to G1 - treated cells was similar to the total amount bound to control cells , it is clear preparation . A second source may be the iodotoxin itself as trace amounts of labeled AI were detected in some preparations of lZ5I - choleragen .

In addition , some cells were incu - bated with 20 pl of antitoxin for 5 min at 4 " C before shifting to 37 " c for 1 h . The cells were then assayed for cAMP content and A1 as described under " Experimental Procedures .

The results in Table I also indicated that both activation of adenylate cyclase and generation of AI in intact cells were temperature - dependent . When toxin - treated NB cells were incubated at different temperatures for 1 h , there was no significant increase in CAMP levels or A1 at 4 " C ( Table 11 ) . Both parameters increased with increasing temperature . It had previously been shown that when toxin - treated cells were exposed to anticholeragen antibodies prior to being shifted to higher temperatures , activation of adenylate cyclase was ef - fectively blocked ( 13 ) . The antitoxin also blocked the gener - ation of AI ( Table 11 ) . DISCUSSION Our results demonstrate a clear correlation between gener - ation of A1 and activation of adenylate cyclase in intact cells treated with choleragen . Both processes occurred after a sim - ilar lag period at 37 " C . Both were temperature - dependent and blocked at 4 " C and by anti - choleragen antibodies . It had been shown previously that inhibition of protein synthesis blocked both the formation of AI and the activation of ade - nylate cyclase in intact macrophages ( 14 ) . Although the cells used in our studies bound large amounts of toxin , only a small fraction was converted to AI ( less than 1 % ) by the end of the lag period when adenylate cyclase activity was rapidly rising . In previous studies , it had been demonstrated that only a small number of toxin molecules were required to activate adenylate cyclase ( 10 , 13 ) . It had been observed previously that AI activated adenylate cyclase in disrupted cells and membrane preparations and that this process required NAD ( 6 , 10 ) . Moss and Vaughan ( 7 ) demonstrated that AI is an ADP - ribosyltransferase and it is generally accepted that AI catalyzes the ADP - ribosylation of the regulatory component of adenylate cyclase ( 8 , 9 , 18 ) . By indirect methods , it was shown that the regulatory corn - ponent is also ADP - ribosylated in intact cells treated by choleragen ( 18 , 19 ) . There are several unresolved differences between the action of choleragen on intact and disrupted cells . There is a distinct lag period in intact cells whereas AI activated adenylate cyclase without a delay in membranes ( 6 ) . AI catalyzes the ADP - ribosylation of numerous cellular proteins ( 8 , 9 , 18 - 22 ) as well as derivatives of arginine and many model proteins ( 7 , 20 ) . This lack of specificity does not appear to occur in intact cells ( 18 , 19 ) . This latter point raises the possibility that in intact cells some derivative of A is the active component . Matuo et al . ( 23 ) reported that membrane proteases generated small fragments from A that were capable of activating ade - nylate cyclase . Others , based on the inhibitory effects of lysomotropic agents on choleragen action , have suggested that the toxin undergoes processing in the lysosome to generate an active fragment ( 24 , 25 ) . We were unable to detect any degradation of the toxin subunits during the time course of adenylate cyclase activa - t i ~ n . ~ The only observed modification was the conversion of a small portion of A to AI . Thus , our data are consistent with A1 and not some fragment of AI being the active component of choleragen in intact cells . The apparent lack of specificity of AI observed in membranes and model systems may be related to the large amounts of A1 used for ADP - ribosylation ( 8 , 9 , 18 - 22 ) , the requirement for other cellular components ( 10 , 26 - 28 ) that may provide specificity to AI in the intact cell , or the possibility that AI remains associated with the mem - brane during ADP - ribosylation in the intact cell . In the intact cell , A may be reduced to AI by cytoplasmic thiols such as glutathione or by a thio1 : protein disulfide oxi - doreductase in the plasma membrane ( 29 ) . Irrespective of the method of reduction , our results clearly show that there is a delay in the generation of AI by intact cells and this delay may represent in part the lag period observed before adenylate cyclase is activated by choleragen .
