However , the elements in Talin1 that are responsi - ble for localizing it to adhesion complexes are not known . In this report we have used a series of constructs based on the modular structure of Talin1 to determine the structural elements that specify the subcellular localization of Talin1 . We show that the conserved actin - binding I / LWEQ module at the C - terminus of Talin1 is neces - sary and sufﬁcient for targeting to focal adhesion complexes . We also used trunca - tion and site - directed mutagenesis to demonstrate that this novel targeting function correlates with , but is separable from , the actin - binding properties of the Talin1 I / LWEQ module . In addition , we have shown that focal adhesion targeting , unlike actin binding , is not conserved among I / LWEQ module proteins . Finally , we have demonstrated that the subcellular localization of the Talin1 I / LWEQ module is regu - lated by an intrasteric interaction with an upstream a - helix , suggesting that both the actin binding and adhesion - targeting elements are masked in full - length Talin1 . Our results deﬁne a novel role for the I / LWEQ module as the primary adhesion - complex targeting determinant of Talin1 and suggest that pathways that can relieve inhibition of I / LWEQ module function will be important for regulating the structural and signaling properties of adhesion complexes .

Cell Motility and the Cytoskeleton 63 : 563 – 581 ( 2006 ) INTRODUCTION Integrins play a crucial role in the attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) and are therefore involved in a variety of cellular functions , including adhesion , migration , differentiation , and morphogene - sis [ Hynes , 1992 ; Giancotti , 2000 ; Holly et al . , 2000 ; Miranti and Brugge , 2002 ] . Integrin - dependent interac - tions between cells and the ECM are mediated by dynamic , multicomponent assemblies called focal adhe - sions , which transduce signals across the plasma mem - brane between the ECM and the actin cytoskeleton [ Bur - ridge and Connell , 1983 ; Craig and Johnson , 1996 ; Critchley , 2000 ; Sastry and Burridge , 2000 ] . At focal adhesions , heterodimeric a / b integrins are bound exter - nally to the ECM and internally to integrin tail binding proteins such as talin and a - actinin [ Horwitz et al . , 1986 ; Pavalko et al . , 1991 ] . In turn , these proteins bind to F - actin , thereby completing the linkage between the actin cytoskeleton and the ECM [ Liu et al . , 2000 ; Calderwood , 2004 ] . Talin was originally identiﬁed as a component of rufﬂing membranes and focal adhesions [ Burridge and Connell , 1983 ] and was subsequently characterized as the ﬁrst cytoplasmic protein to bind directly to integrins [ Horwitz et al . , 1986 ] . Talin has since been shown to play a pivotal role in focal adhesion formation and rein - forcement by serving as the direct connection between ECM - bound integrins and internal focal adhesion com - ponents such as actin and vinculin [ Critchley , 2004 ] . In addition to maintaining the structural integrity of focal adhesions , talin also plays key roles in focal adhesion signaling , including inside - out activation of integrins , conformational activation of vinculin , and generation of second messengers including phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bis - phosphate [ Calderwood et al . , 2002 ; Di Paolo et al . , 2002 ; Ling et al . , 2002 ; Tadokoro et al . , 2003 ; Calderwood , 2004 ; Izard and Vonrhein , 2004 ; Izard et al . , 2004 ; Cohen et al . , 2005 ] . Genetic analysis of talin function in Drosophila melanogaster , Caenorhabditis elegans , and Mus muscu - lus indicates that talin expression is required for the for - mation of cell adhesions [ Monkley et al . , 2000 ; Brown et al . , 2002 ; Cram et al . , 2003 ] . Dysregulation of talin expression in D . melanogaster and C . elegans , which have only one talin gene [ Senetar and McCann , 2005 ] , causes both cell migration and muscle attachment defects that are similar to integrin mutant phenotypes [ Brown et al . , 2002 ; Cram et al . , 2003 ] . Vertebrates have two independent talin genes , TLN1 and TLN2 , which encode Talin1 and Talin2 [ Monkley et al . , 2001 ; Senetar and McCann , 2005 ] . Down - regulation of Talin1 in cells is accompanied by defects in processing and plasma membrane localization of b 1 integrins , diminished integ - rin activation , and reduced cell spreading and focal adhe - sion formation caused by compromised cytoskeletal link - ages [ Albiges - Rizo et al . , 1995 ; Martel et al . , 2001 ; Jiang et al . , 2003 ; Tadokoro et al . , 2003 ] . Mouse embryonic stem cells lacking Talin1 exhibit anchorage - independent growth and lack focal adhesions [ Priddle et al . , 1998 ] . TLN1 - null mice have an embryonic lethal phenotype caused by a cell migration defect at gastrulation [ Monkley et al . , 2000 ] . Taken together , these studies support the role of Talin1 as an essential component of integrin - based cell adhesions . Interestingly , TLN1 - null mice pos - sess a functional TLN2 gene , indicating that Talin2 can - not compensate for the loss of Talin1 in focal adhesion formation and cell migration . Little is known about Talin2 , although several studies suggest that Talin1 and Talin2 have non - redundant roles in vertebrates [ Di Paolo et al . , 2002 ; Jiang et al . , 2003 ; Tadokoro et al . , 2003 ; Senetar et al . , 2004 ; Senetar and McCann , 2005 ] . Talin1 is a large ( 2541 amino acids ) , dimeric , mod - ular protein consisting of an N - terminal globular head domain and a C - terminal helical rod domain ( Fig . 1A ) . The 47 - kDa head domain ( amino acids 1 – 433 ) includes a FERM domain and is responsible for linking Talin1 to the inner face of the plasma membrane , primarily through interactions with integrin b - subunits and mem - brane phospholipids [ Rees et al . , 1990 ; Niggli et al . , 1994 ; Chishti et al . , 1998 ] . The head domain also con - tains binding sites for the integral membrane protein layilin [ Borowsky and Hynes , 1998 ] , focal adhesion kinase [ Parsons et al . , 2000 ] , myosin [ Lin et al . , 1998 ] , PIPKI g [ Ling et al . , 2002 ] , and actin [ Hemmings et al . , 1996 ; Lee et al . , 2004 ] . The rod domain of Talin1 ( 434 – 2541 ) consists of multiple a - helical alanine - rich repeats [ McLachlan et al . , 1994 ] and contains a dimerization motif [ Winkler et al . , 1997 ] , a second b - integrin binding site [ Xing et al . , 2001 ; Tremuth et al . , 2004 ] , three well - characterized vinculin binding sites [ Gilmore et al . , 1993 ; Bass et al . , 1999 ] , a TES binding site [ Coutts et al . , 2003 ] , and two actin - binding sites [ Hemmings et al . , 1996 ] , including the C - terminal I / LWEQ mod - ule [ McCann and Craig , 1997 , 1999 ; Senetar et al . , 2004 ] . The N - terminal head and C - terminal rod domains of Talin1 can be cleaved into stable fragments in vivo by the intracellular protease calpain 2 [ Carragher et al . , 1999 ; Franco et al . , 2004a ] . The binding afﬁnity of the head domain for b - integrin cytoplasmic tails increases when it is freed from the rod domain by calpain 2 cleav - age [ Yan et al . , 2001 ] . Calpain - 2 - mediated proteolysis of Talin1 is also required for proper focal adhesion disas - sembly during cell migration [ Franco et al . , 2004b ] . These data indicate that proteolysis of Talin1 regulates focal adhesion structure and function . Several studies have shown that the subcellular localization of the head 564 Franco et al . Fig . 1 . Subcellular localization of the Talin1 head and rod domains . A : Schematic representation of the modular architecture of Talin1 . The head and rod domains are illustrated , along with the C - terminal I / LWEQ module . Talin1 partner binding - sites and the site of calpain - 2 - mediated proteolysis are also shown . B : HeLa cells were transfected with GFP - Talin1 , GFP - Talin1 - head , or GFP - Talin1 - rod and plated on ﬁbronectin for 2 hours . Cells were ﬁxed and stained for vinculin and ﬂuorescence images were taken at 100 3 ( scale bar , 25 l m ) . Represen - tative images of individual ﬂuorescence channels and overlays of GFP ( green ) and vinculin ( red ) demonstrate that GFP - Talin1 and GFP - Talin1 - rod colocalize ( yellow ) with vinculin , but GFP - Talin1 - head does not . and rod domain of Talin1 are distinct when they are sep - arated [ O’Halloran et al . , 1985 ; Nuckolls et al . , 1992 ; Hemmings et al . , 1996 ; Hayashi et al . , 1999 ] . For exam - ple , studies using ﬂuorescently tagged microinjected pro - teins demonstrated that the head domain only weakly tar - geted to vinculin - containing focal adhesions , with most of the protein remaining diffuse in the cytoplasm . In comparison , microinjection of ﬂuorescently tagged rod domain strongly labeled vinculin - containing focal adhe - sions [ Nuckolls et al . , 1990 ] . In addition , the rod domain of human platelet talin , which is Talin1 [ Senetar , 2005 ] , strongly labels focal adhesions in rat embryo ﬁbroblasts [ Hemmings et al . , 1996 ] . These ﬁndings raise the possi - bility that control of Talin1 localization is important in regulating its function . Although Talin1 contains binding sites for several focal adhesion components , the precise determinants of Talin1 targeting to focal adhesions are not known . Using a series of deletion , truncation , and point mutants , we have performed an extensive analysis of the head and rod domains of Talin1 with respect to focal adhesion localization and actin binding . Using ﬂuorescence mi - croscopy to analyze the localization patterns of GFP - tagged constructs spanning the entire length of Talin1 , we have shown that the N - terminal head domain of Talin1 does not label focal adhesions in HeLa cells . In contrast , the C - terminal rod domain of Talin1 targeted strongly to focal adhesions . Moreover , the C - terminus of the rod domain containing the I / LWEQ module was nec - essary and sufﬁcient to strongly label vinculin - and actin - containing focal adhesions , and this capacity was separable from actin binding . We also have shown that adhesion complex targeting , unlike actin binding , is not conserved among I / LWEQ module proteins . Finally , we demonstrate that , as with actin binding , subcellular local - ization of the Talin1 I / LWEQ module is regulated by an intrasteric mechanism in which an upstream a - helix interferes with focal adhesion targeting . Our results deﬁne a novel role for the I / LWEQ module as the pri - mary focal adhesion complex targeting determinant of Talin1 . Elucidation of the mechanisms by which actin binding and focal adhesion targeting are regulated will be essential to understanding how Talin1 functions in focal adhesions . MATERIALS AND METHODS Expression Constructs GFP - Talin1 has been described previously [ Franco et al . , 2004b ] . GFP - Talin1 - head was cloned by remov - ing an EcoRI / SalI fragment from MT5 0 P ( in pJ6 R vec - tor ) and cloning the Talin1 head fragment ( encoding amino acids 1 – 433 ) into pEGFP - C1 ( Clontech , Palo Alto , CA ) that had been frame - shifted by cutting with BglII , blunting and religating . GFP - Talin1 - rod was cloned by removing the Talin1 rod domain ( encoding amino acids 434 – 2541 ) from MT3 0 P ( in pJ6 O 7 vector ) and cloning into the same frame - shifted pEGFP - C1 vec - tor . GFP - Talin1 rod deletion constructs were cloned by cutting pEGFP - Talin1 - rod with the following enzymes and religating the GFP - containing fragments : 434 – 2197 - SalI ; 434 – 1976 - KpnI ; 434 – 1341 - SmaI ; 1072 – 2541 - XhoI . GFP - Talin1 1 – 2197 was cloned by cutting GFP - Talin1 with SalI and religating the GFP - containing fragment . Expression constructs for I / LWEQ module proteins were prepared by PCR ampliﬁcation of the particular coding sequence of Talin1 , Sla2 , and Hip1 , using spe - ciﬁc sense and antisense primer pairs as described [ McCann and Craig , 1997 , 1999 ; Senetar et al . , 2004 ] . The Talin1 I / LWEQ module N - terminal truncations were prepared using the following sense primers : T1 ( 2378 – 2541 ) 5 0 - GCCATTCCAGCCAATGCA - 3 0 T2 ( 2417 – 2541 ) 5 0 - GGCCATGCTAGCCAGGAG - 3 0 T3 ( 2451 – 2541 ) 5 0 - GAGGCAATGAAACGGCTC - 3 0 T4 ( 2496 – 2541 ) 5 0 - GGCATTGCCCAGATTATC - 3 0 For each of these constructs the 3 0 antisense primer used was : 5 0 - TTAGTGCTCGTCTCG - 3 0 For C - terminal truncations T5 – T7 the following primers were used : T5 ( 2338 – 2378 ) 5 0 - GGCGCCCACCTTTCCTTG - 3 0 T6 ( 2338 – 2417 ) 5 0 - GCCCTGGACAGCTGCGTT - 3 0 T7 ( 2338 – 2451 ) 5 0 - CTCAGACTCCTGATCTGC - 3 0 . The sense primer used for these truncations was : 5 0 - TCCTTGAACTTTGAGGAAC - 3 0 . The R2526G / A / K mutations were introduced into Talin1 2345 – 2541 using the following mutagenic anti - sense primers ( mutagenic nucleotides underlined ) : R2526G : 5 0 - TTAGTGCTCGTCTCGAAGCTCTGA - AGGCAAGAACTTGTACTGCTGCTGCC CG ATCTG R2526A : 5 0 - TTAGTGCTCGTCTCGAAGCTCTGAA - GGCAAGAACTTGTACTGCTGCTG GC GATCTG - 3 0 R2526K : 5 0 - TTAGTGCTCGTCTCGAAGCTCT - GAAGGCAAGAACTTGTACTGCTGCTGC TT GATCTG - 3 0 The resulting PCR products were subcloned into pGEX - 2T for preparation of GST - fusion proteins and pEGFP - C3 for expression as GFP - fusion proteins . The QuikChange site - directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene ) was used to generate R2526 point mutations in GFP - Talin1 using the following primers : R2526G 5 0 - GCTCGCCCAGATC G G C CAGCAG - CAGTACAA - 3 0 and its complement ; R2526K 5 0 - GCTCGCCCAGATC AA GCAGCAG - CAGTACAA - 3 0 and its complement . The accuracy of all constructs was veriﬁed by DNA sequencing . 566 Franco et al . Protein Analysis Skeletal muscle actin was puriﬁed from rabbit skele - tal muscle [ Spudich and Watt , 1971 ; MacLean - Fletcher and Pollard , 1980 ] , and F - actin binding assays were per - formed as previously described [ McCann and Craig , 1997 , 1999 ; Senetar et al . , 2004 ] , keeping the concentration of the I / LWEQ module protein constant at 2 . 0 l M while increasing the actin concentration from zero to 30 l M in a total volume of 50 l l . The USH - I / LWEQ module se - quence alignment was calculated using CLUSTAL W [ Thompson et al . , 1994 ] and prepared for publication using MacBoxShade ( version . 2 . 11 , www . biozen trum . uni - bas . ch / ~ biocomp ) . The I / LWEQ module blocks were iden - tiﬁed using BlockMaker [ Henikoff et al . , 1995 ] on the Blocks server ( www . blocks . fhcrc . org ) . Secondary struc - ture prediction was performed using the PHD algorithm [ Rost and Sander , 1994 ] on the PredictProtein server ( dod . cpmc . Columbia . edu / predictprotein ) . The circular dichroism spectrum of Talin1 2345 – 2541 was obtained on a Jasco J - 810 spectrometer equipped with a Peltier temperature control device . Cell Culture , Transfection , and Immunocytochemical Analysis HeLa cells ( American Type Culture Collection CCL - 2 ) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % FBS , 4 . 5 g / L glucose , 2 mM L - glutamine , 1 % non - essential amino acids , 100 l g / ml penicillin , and 100 l g / ml streptomycin . Glass coverslips were acid - washed and coated with 10 l g / ml ﬁbronectin . HeLa cells were plated on the cov - erslips in complete growth medium and allowed to adhere for 2 hours . Transfection of HeLa cells was per - formed with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . Cells plated at 8 3 10 3 in 24 - well plates were transfected 24 hours later with 0 . 5 l g of DNA and 2 l l Lipofectamine 2000 in 200 l l OptiMEM for 24 – 48 hours . Cells were then ﬁxed , permeabilized , and stained with anti - vinculin antibody ( VIN - 11 - 5 , Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) . Fluorescence images were taken on a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope with 60 3 and 100 3 objec - tives . Localization studies were performed on three inde - pendent samples in quadruplicate . PtK2 cells ( an epithe - lial - like cell line derived from the kangaroo rat , Potorous tridactylis ; American Type Culture Collection CCL - 56 ) were cultured on poly L - lysine - coated coverslips in Min - imal Essential Medium ( MEM , Life Technologies ) sup - plemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and 2 mM gluta - mine . These cells were transiently transfected with GFP - fusion constructs using polyethylenimine ( Aldrich ) as the DNA carrier . Forty - two hours post - transfection , cells were ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde / PBS and permeabilized for 60 seconds on ice with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in 10 mM MES , 138 mM KCl , 3 mM MgCl 2 , 4 mM EGTA , pH 6 . 1 . Stress ﬁbers were labeled with primary antibody to actin ( 4 l g / l l ) overnight at 4 8 C in a humid chamber , followed by incubation with secondary antibody ( rhodamine - labeled donkey anti - Rabbit IgG ) for 60 minutes at room temperature . Expression of intact GFP - Talin1 constructs in transfected cells was veriﬁed in immunoblots . RESULTS The Talin1 Rod Domain , but not Head Domain , Localizes to Focal Adhesion Complexes in Cells Adherent to Fibronectin To study the subcellular localization patterns of Talin1 and its head and rod domains ( Fig . 1A ) , HeLa cells were transiently transfected with GFP - Talin1 and the GFP - tagged Talin1 head and rod constructs and ana - lyzed by ﬂuorescence microscopy . As expected based on our previous study [ Franco et al . , 2004b ] , GFP - Talin1 preferentially labeled vinculin - containing adhesion com - plexes when transfected cells were plated on ﬁbronectin ( Fig . 1B , row 1 ) . The GFP - tagged Talin1 rod domain ( GFP - Talin1 - rod ) , which contains binding sites for vin - culin [ Bass et al . , 1999 ] , b - integrins [ Xing et al . , 2001 ; Tremuth et al . , 2004 ] , and actin [ Hemmings et al . , 1996 ; McCann and Craig , 1997 ] , also colocalized with vinculin in adhesion complexes ( Fig . 1B , row 3 ) . In contrast , the GFP - Talin1 - head fusion protein remained diffuse throughout the cytoplasm ( Fig . 1B , row 2 ) , despite con - taining binding sites for several focal adhesion compo - nents , including b - integrins [ Calderwood et al . , 1999 ] , FAK [ Chen et al . , 1995 ] , PIPKI g 661 [ Ling et al . , 2002 ] , and actin [ Hemmings et al . , 1996 ] . Similar results were obtained using a Myc - tagged Talin1 - head fusion protein ( data not shown ) . Our results are largely consistent with results obtained with microinjection of ﬂuorescently labeled Talin1 fragments [ Nuckolls et al . , 1990 ] and con - ﬁrm that the primary focal - adhesion - targeting sequence in Talin1 is located in the C - terminal rod domain . The I / LWEQ Module is Necessary and Sufﬁcient for Targeting Talin1 to Focal Adhesions To further map the elements required for targeting Talin1 to adhesion complexes , we prepared truncation mutants of the GFP - Talin1 - rod construct ( Fig . 2A ) and assessed their ability to localize to adhesion sites . A trun - cation mutant representing the ﬁrst half of the rod do - main ( 434 – 1341 ) , which comprises two vinculin - binding sites and one actin - binding site , localized very weakly to vinculin - containing adhesion complexes ( Fig . 2B , row 1 ) . Surprisingly , a mutant containing all three well - characterized vinculin - binding sites ( 434 – 1976 ) and one that also included the integrin - binding site ( 434 – 2197 ) Analysis of the Functional Domains of Talin1 567 Figure 2 . were completely excluded from focal adhesions ( Fig . 2B , rows 2 , 3 ) . However , a truncation mutant that extended to the C - terminus of the rod domain ( 1072 – 2541 ) exhib - ited a localization pattern identical to that of the full - length rod domain ( Fig . 2B , row 4 ) . These data demon - strated that the last 344 amino acid residues of Talin1 are required for maximal targeting of the rod domain to focal adhesions and raised the possibility that the C - terminal I / LWEQ module contains the primary focal - adhesion - targeting determinant for Talin1 . In support of this hypothesis , deletion of the I / LWEQ module from full - length Talin1 ( 1 – 2197 ; Fig . 3A ) completely abolished localization of Talin1 to vinculin - containing adhesion complexes ( Fig . 3B , row 1 ) . Moreover , expression of the I / LWEQ module as a GFP - fusion protein ( 2345 – 2541 , Fig . 3A ) revealed that the I / LWEQ module alone targeted very well to focal adhe - sions ( Fig . 3B , row 2 ) . Taken together , these data indi - cate that the Talin1 I / LWEQ module is necessary and sufﬁcient for focal - adhesion - complex targeting and that intact binding sites for several other focal adhesion pro - teins are not sufﬁcient for localization of Talin1 to focal adhesions . I / LWEQ Module Determinants of Focal Adhesion Localization and Actin Binding The I / LWEQ module was originally identiﬁed as an ancient , conserved actin - binding domain found in ani - mal talin and fungal Sla2 . The alignment of ﬁve I / LWEQ modules , including approximately 45 residues ( USH ) N - terminal to the I / LWEQ module , and the positions of the conserved Blocks 1 – 4 [ McCann and Craig , 1997 , 1999 ; Senetar et al . , 2004 ] is shown in Fig . 4A . Second - ary structure prediction using the PHD algorithm [ Rost and Sander , 1994 ] indicated that Blocks 1 – 4 of the mouse Talin1 I / LWEQ module are substantially coexten - sive with ﬁve putative a - helices ( Fig . 4B ) . According to PHD , the I / LWEQ module is > 95 % a - helical . We tested this prediction with circular dichroism spectroscopy and found that the spectrum of mouse Talin1 2345 – 2541 ( Fig . 4C ) is characteristic of predominantly a - helical proteins . Essentially identical secondary structures were predicted for the other I / LWEQ module sequences included in the sequence alignment ( not shown ) . We have previously shown that the a - helical region N - termi - nal to the I / LWEQ module ( USH ) inhibits actin interac - tions in vitro in Talin1 , Talin2 , Hip1 , and Hip12 by blocking the actin - binding sites of these proteins [ Sene - tar et al . , 2004 ] . The USH is structurally conserved de - spite a lack of sequence similarity among all I / LWEQ module proteins including talins and Sla2 / Hip1 , across the phylogenetic distance from amoebozoans ( e . g . , D . discoideum ) to mammals ( Fig . 4A ) . This sequence and structural conservation of the I / LWEQ module implies that Blocks 1 – 4 and the USH are important for I / LWEQ module protein function . Based on this structural organization , we constructed a series of GFP - Talin1 I / LWEQ module truncations ( Fig . 5A ) . As large deletions may disrupt the a - helical structure of the I / LWEQ module , we chose to generate deletions in pre - dicted loop regions between each conserved block and used these mutants to identify focal - adhesion - localization and actin - binding determinants of the Talin1 I / LWEQ module ( Fig . 5B ) . Deletion of Block 1 ( T1 ) caused a slight loss of adhesion complex targeting ( Fig . 5B , row 3 vs . row 2 ) . Further deletion of Block 2 , and the ﬁrst and second a - helices of Block 3 ( T2 – T4 ) progressively less - ened , but did not abolish focal adhesion localization ( Fig . 5B , rows 4 , 5 ) . Deletion of Block 4 in combination with Block 2 and the second a - helix of Block 3 ( Fig . 5B ; T5 – T7 , rows 1 – 3 , right panel ) , completely abolished the distinct targeting to focal adhesions seen with constructs containing Blocks 2 – 4 ( (cid:1) USH , T1 ) . These constructs were slightly enriched at the cell periphery , however , per - haps due to the charge characteristics of these I / LWEQ module truncations . These data show that Block 4 and the preceding a - helix from Block 3 are sufﬁcient for minimal localization to adhesion complexes , but that the entire I / LWEQ module of Talin1 is required for maximal targeting . The I / LWEQ module is a well - characterized actin - binding element in Talin1 , Talin2 , Hip1 , Hip12 , and Sla2 [ McCann and Craig , 1997 ; Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 1999 ; Senetar et al . , 2004 ] . Interestingly , inclusion of the USH , which interferes with actin binding [ Senetar et al . , 2004 ] , also inhibited focal - adhesion targeting of the Talin1 I / LWEQ module [ Fig . 5B , row 1 ( + USH ) vs . row 2 ( (cid:1) USH ) ] . This raised the possibility that the actin binding capacity of the Talin1 I / LWEQ module is impor - tant for focal adhesion targeting . Therefore , we deter - mined the relationship between actin - binding capacities and subcellular localization of the truncation mutants Fig . 2 .

Representative images of individ - ual ﬂuorescence channels and overlays of GFP ( green ) and vinculin ( red ) demonstrate that amino acids 1 – 2197 do not colocalize ( yellow ) with vinculin in adhesion complexes , but the GFP - tagged I / LWEQ module alone localizes to vinculin - containing adhesion complexes .

Blocks 1 – 4 are outlined . Invariant residues and in red , conserved residues in blue , and similar residues in yellow .

The arrow - head identiﬁes the conserved arginine that is required for actin binding and focal adhesion targeting in Talin1 .

C : The circular dichroism spectrum of MmTn1 2345 – 2541 ( without the hexahistidine tag ) was determined at 15 8 C using 1 . 0 l M protein in 25 mM sodium phosphate , pH 7 . 2 , and 40 mM NaCl . This spectrum conﬁrms the a - helical content of the I / LWEQ module predicted by PHD . F i gu r e 4 . Analysis of the Functional Domains of Talin1 571 ( Fig . 5C ) . Each of the N - terminal truncation mutants , beginning with Block 1 and extending toward the C - terminus , cosedimented with F - actin , but the apparent capacity of the I / LWEQ module for F - actin decreased as Blocks 1 , 2 , and 3 were progressively deleted . Removal of Block 1 ( T1 ) reduced the acting binding capacity to 83 % that of full - length ( (cid:1) USH ) , while deletion of Blocks 1 – 3 ( T3 ) further lowered capacity to 51 % of the full - length I / LWEQ module . Truncation T4 , which contains only Block 4 , cosedimented with F - actin at only 14 % capacity compared to the full - length . All truncations lacking Block 4 , including T8 , which lacks only Block 4 were unable to bind to F - actin in vitro ( Fig . 5C ) . These data show that decreasing actin - binding capacity of the Talin1 I / LWEQ module correlates well with progressive loss of targeting to focal adhesions . Further analyses revealed , however , that robust actin binding is not absolutely required for focal adhe - sion localization . We previously showed that mutation of the conserved arginine - 958 to glycine ( R958G ) in Block 4 of the S . cerevisiae Sla2 I / LWEQ module abolishes the F - actin - binding capacity of GST - Sla2 771 – 968 [ McCann and Craig , 1997 ] . To determine the effect of the equivalent mutation on the Talin1 I / LWEQ module , we prepared the cognate R2526G mutant in Talin1 . Since the arginine - to - glycine mutation is a drastic change that may be expected to disrupt the a - helical structure of Block 4 of the I / LWEQ module , we also prepared the more neutral arginine - to - alanine ( R2526A ) mutant and the conservative arginine - to - lysine ( R2526K ) mutant . These three mutants were then assayed for actin - binding capacity and focal adhesion localization . As expected , the R2526G mutation abolished the F - actin - binding capacity of the Talin1 I / LWEQ module ( Fig . 6A ) . The R2526A and R2526K mutations did not abolish actin binding in the Talin1 I / LWEQ module , but they did sig - niﬁcantly reduce it . At 30 l M F - actin , the binding capacity of R2526A was reduced to 21 % , compared to 95 % for the wild - type Talin1 I / LWEQ module . Despite the conservative nature of the arginine - to - lysine substitu - tion , the F - actin binding capacity of the R2526K mutant was essentially identical to that of the R2526A mutant . These results conﬁrm that Block 4 is required for maxi - mal interaction of the I / LWEQ module with F - actin in vitro and also indicate that the conserved arginine - 2526 in Block 4 plays an important role in this interaction . Interestingly , the localization patterns of these I / LWEQ point mutants did not perfectly correlate with their F - actin - binding capacities . The R2526A mutant I / LWEQ module displayed only weak targeting to focal adhesions ( Fig . 6B , row 1 ) , whereas the I / LWEQ - 2526G mutant remained diffuse throughout the cell ( Fig . 6B , row 2 ) . Moreover , the R2526G mutation in the context of full - length Talin1 also abolished targeting of Talin1 to focal adhesions ( Fig . 6C , row 1 ) . However , the R2526K I / LWEQ mutant strongly labeled focal adhe - sions , with a subcellular localization pattern nearly iden - tical to that of the wild - type Talin1 I / LWEQ module ( Fig . 6B , row 3 ) , despite its relatively low capacity to bind F - actin in vitro ( Fig . 6A ) . The R2526K mutant also strongly labeled focal adhesions in the context of the full - length Talin1 molecule ( Fig . 6C , row 2 ) . These data indicate that the R2526K mutation is not a conservative change for actin binding , but is a conservative mutation for focal adhesion targeting . These results from experi - ments performed in HeLa cells were recapitulated when PtK2 cells were transfected with the various GFP - Talin1 constructs and then stained for F - actin ( see supplement , Fig . S1 ) . Both the wild - type and the R2526K mutant robustly labeled focal adhesions in PtK2 cells , while the R2526G mutant was not targeted to focal adhesion and the R2526A mutant only weakly labeled focal adhesions . In PtK2 cells , the wild - type and R2526K I / LWEQ mod - ules also labeled stress ﬁbers . The failure of GFP - Talin1 head and GFP - I / LWEQ module proteins to localize to focal adhesions was not due to degradation . According to immunoblot analyses , intact GFP - fusions were pro - duced in both HeLa and PtK2 cells ( Fig . S3 ) . Fig . 5 .

A : Talin1 arginine - 2526 I / LWEQ mutants were prepared as GST - fusion pro - teins and assayed for their ability to bind to F - actin . The actin binding capacity of Talin1 2345 – 2541 was completely abol - ished by mutation of arginine - 2526 to gly - cine ( R2526G , ~ ) . Mutation of arginine - 2526 to alanine ( R2526A , l ) or lysine ( R2526K , H ) signiﬁcantly reduced actin binding , by 80 % compared to Talin1 2345 – 2541 ( (cid:1) USH , O ) .

In contrast , R2526A localized only very weakly to focal adhesions and R2526G remained diffuse throughout the cell . C : The R2526G and R2526K point mutations were introduced into full - length GFP - Talin1 . HeLa cells were transfected with GFP - Talin1 - R2526G and GFP - Talin1 - R2526K and treated and imaged as in B . As with the I / LWEQ module constructs , Talin1 - R2526G does not colocalize with vinculin in adhesion complexes , while the conserved Talin1 - R2526K mutant is tar - geted to focal adhesions . Actin Binding , but not Adhesion - Complex Targeting , is Conserved Among I / LWEQ Modules Since all I / LWEQ module proteins interact with F - actin , we next asked whether F - actin binding is sufﬁcient for targeting I / LWEQ modules to adhesion complexes . Therefore , we examined the actin - binding and adhesion - targeting properties of the I / LWEQ modules from S . cerevisiae Sla2 and human Hip1 . Consistent with pre - vious studies [ McCann and Craig , 1997 ; McCann and Craig , 1999 ; Senetar et al . , 2004 ] , both I / LWEQ modules bound F - actin in vitro . The actin - binding capacity of the Sla2 I / LWEQ ( 771 – 968 ) was identical to that of the Talin1 I / LWEQ , while the capacity of the Hip1 I / LWEQ ( 693 – 914 ) was about 21 % less ( Fig . 7A ) . However , nei - ther the Hip1 nor the Sla2 I / LWEQ modules localized to focal adhesions in Hela cells ( Fig . 7B ) or PtK2 cells ( supplement , Fig . S2 ) . The Sla2 I / LWEQ did preferen - tially label actin stress ﬁbers in both cell types , while the Hip1 I / LWEQ remained diffuse throughout the cyto - plasm in both . These results reveal that adhesion - com - plex targeting is not conserved among I / LWEQ modules and that F - actin binding capacity in vitro is not sufﬁcient for I / LWEQ module localization to focal adhesions . DISCUSSION Talin1 has recently emerged as a key structural and signaling component of integrin - containing focal adhe - sion complexes . In this study , we have mapped the region of Talin1 required for its subcellular localization to focal adhesions and determined that the conserved C - terminal I / LWEQ module is necessary and sufﬁcient for this targeting . We have also used truncation and site - directed mutagenesis , along with analysis of I / LWEQ modules from other proteins , to investigate the relation - ship between subcellular localization and actin binding of I / LWEQ module proteins . Our results , which are sum - marized in Fig . 8 , demonstrate that subcellular localiza - tion patterns correlate somewhat with actin binding in vitro , but that these properties can be separated . Inter - estingly , robust actin binding is neither necessary nor sufﬁcient for the localization signals that recruit the Talin1 I / LWEQ module to focal adhesions . Therefore , this study identiﬁes a novel adhesion - targeting property of the I / LWEQ module that is distinct from its previ - ously deﬁned actin - binding function . The modular organization of Talin1 is thought to be responsible for the functions of Talin1 in focal adhe - sions as an essential link between the ECM and the actin cytoskeleton . The general consensus has been that focal adhesion localization of Talin1 is due to interactions with other focal adhesion components , such as b - integrins and vinculin , through well - characterized binding sites for these Talin1 binding partners . However , comparison of the subcellular distribution of the Talin1 head and rod domains showed that the head domain , which contains a FERM domain that presumably speciﬁes plasma mem - brane localization [ Chishti et al . , 1998 ] and binding sites for integrin , FAK , and layilin [ Rees et al . , 1990 ; Niggli et al . , 1994 ; Borowsky and Hynes , 1998 ; Parsons et al . , 2000 ] , does not possess determinants for robust focal adhesion localization . In contrast , the C - terminal rod domain localized to focal adhesions as well as full - length Talin1 . Subsequent analysis of four GFP - fusion con - structs spanning the entire rod domain indicated that the focal adhesion localization determinant is located in the C - terminal 344 amino acids of Talin1 . Thus , these data show that the well - characterized binding sites for integ - rin , FAK , layilin , actin , and vinculin in residues 1 – 2197 of Talin1 are not sufﬁcient for the targeting of Talin1 to focal adhesions . Instead , the C - terminus of Talin1 , which includes the I / LWEQ module , contains the dominant Talin1 focal - adhesion - localization determinant . This was conﬁrmed by showing that the C - terminal truncation ( 1 – 2197 ) of full - length Talin1 , which includes the head domain , is not targeted to focal adhesions , whereas a GFP - fusion containing only the Talin1 I / LWEQ module targeted to focal adhesions essentially as well as full - length Talin1 . These data show that , in addition to bind - ing to F - actin , the Talin1 I / LWEQ module also contains a focal - adhesion - targeting signal likely to be essential to Talin1 function . In general , our ﬁndings are consistent with those of Nuckolls et al . and demonstrate the major focal adhesion - targeting determinant is in the rod domain of talin [ Nuckolls et al . , 1990 ] . That report showed that the head domain of talin remained primarily diffuse in the cytoplasm and that the rod domain strongly labeled focal adhesions . Other studies have shown that the localization of chicken Talin1 in chicken embryo ﬁbroblasts was similar , with strong rod domain targeting to focal adhe - sions and very faint localization of the head domain to focal adhesions [ Hemmings et al . , 1996 ] . In more recent studies using CHO cells transfected with integrin a IIb b 3 - GFP [ Tremuth et al . , 2004 ] or melanoma cells trans - fected with a V b 3 integrin [ Cluzel et al . , 2005 ] , GFP - Talin1 head targeted to focal adhesions . This difference may be due to the fact that HeLa cells do not express high levels of b 3 integrin [ Jin et al . , 1998 ; Chatterjee and Chatterjee , 2001 ] and that , unlike our experiments , the other studies have used cells that overexpress exoge - nous b 3 integrin . Despite this discrepancy , our data clearly show that full - length Talin1 lacking only the I / LWEQ module ( 1 – 2197 ) does not target to focal adhe - sions in cells adherent to ﬁbronectin , and that the I / LWEQ module alone strongly labels focal adhesions . Therefore , the localization of Talin1 to focal adhesions is Analysis of the Functional Domains of Talin1 575 Fig . 7 .

These ﬁndings identify a novel focal adhesion targeting function for this conserved structural element , which was previously known only as the primary actin - binding domain of Talin1 [ McCann and Craig , 1997 ] . The I / LWEQ modules of Talin1 , Talin2 , Sla2 , and Hip1 / Hip12 contain strong F - actin - binding capacity [ McCann and Craig , 1997 ; McCann and Craig , 1999 ; Senetar et al . , 2004 ] . This , along with our present subcellu - lar targeting data , led us to examine the relationship between actin binding and focal adhesion localization in the Talin1 I / LWEQ module . Using a series of truncation and point mutants , we found that Talin1 actin binding and focal adhesion localization are correlated ; minimal determi - nants for both properties are associated with the C - terminus of the I / LWEQ module . Further analysis of point mutations supported a primary role for Block 4 in actin binding and focal adhesion localization . We previously showed that mutation of the conserved arginine - 958 of yeast Sla2 to glycine abolished Sla2 I / LWEQ module actin binding [ McCann and Craig , 1997 ] . This residue corresponds to ar - ginine - 2526 of Talin1 . The R2526G mutation also abol - ished the actin - binding capacity of the Talin1 I / LWEQ module . Moreover , this mutant also failed to target to focal adhesions , both as a GFP - I / LWEQ - R2526G mutant and in the context of full - length Talin1 - R2526G . Since the argi - nine - to - glycine mutation is a potential a - helix disrupter , we also changed arginine - 2526 to alanine , which is a more neutral mutation , and lysine , which is a putative conserva - tive change . Actin binding in the R2526A and R2526K mutants was substantially reduced , but not completely eliminated , compared to the wild type Talin1 I / LWEQ module . Interestingly , while the R2526A mutant did not localize to focal adhesions , localization of the R2526K mu - tant to focal adhesions was robust , both as a GFP - I / LWEQ module construct and in the full - length protein . Thus , the R2526K mutation is not conserved for actin binding , but is a conservative mutation for focal adhesion localization . We have shown that although actin binding and focal adhesion targeting are correlated , robust actin binding is not an absolute requirement for focal adhesion targeting of Talin1 . The behavior of yeast Sla2 and human Hip1 show that actin binding is not sufﬁcient for the targeting of the I / LWEQ module to focal adhesions . The Sla2 I / LWEQ module localized to actin stress ﬁbers in both HeLa and PtK2 cells , which may reﬂect the ability of Sla2 to localize to cortical actin patches in S . cerevisiae [ Yang et al . , 1999 ] . The Sla2 I / LWEQ module also interacted with F - actin at the termini of stress ﬁbers . However , neither I / LWEQ module Hip1 nor Sla2 targeted distinctly to focal adhesions as did the Talin1 I / LWEQ module . These results indicate that sub - cellular localization of the Talin1 I / LWEQ module is deter - mined by targeting motifs that are dominant to actin binding and are sequence - speciﬁc for the Talin1 I / LWEQ module . We have shown previously that the actin binding capacity of the I / LWEQ module is regulated by an intrasteric mechanism , in which a structurally conserved upstream a - helix interferes with actin binding [ Senetar et al . , 2004 ] . We have shown here that focal adhesion localization is also regulated by this same mechanism , since inclusion of the USH in a GFP - Talin1 I / LWEQ module construct ( 2300 – 2541 ) abolished focal adhesion localization ( Fig . 5B ) . Therefore , we hypothesize that relief of the USH - I / LWEQ interaction in cells could simultaneously activate both the adhesion - targeting and actin - binding functions of Talin1 , thereby efﬁciently coupling adhesion complexes to the actin cytoskeleton . Although the mechanism by which intrasteric inhibition of actin binding and focal adhesion localization is relieved in vivo is as yet unknown , this inhibition is con - served and important for I / LWEQ module protein func - tion in both mammals and yeast [ McCann and Craig , 1999 ; Yang et al . , 1999 ] . Therefore , this mechanism may be similar to that observed in other cytoskeletal proteins such as vinculin [ Johnson and Craig , 1994 ; Johnson and Craig , 1995 ; Izard et al . , 2004 ] and the ERM proteins [ Bretscher et al . , 1997 ; Pearson et al . , 2000 ] , in which either protein – protein interactions or post - translational modiﬁcations may expose key binding sites . Our ﬁndings identify the I / LWEQ module as a novel region of Talin1 that is required for focal adhesion target - ing . Although the mechanism responsible for focal adhe - sion localization has not been identiﬁed , it is likely that an I / LWEQ module mediated protein – protein interaction or post - translational modiﬁcation is involved . Extensive analysis of the vinculin - talin interaction has identiﬁed sev - eral new putative vinculin - binding sites in Talin1 [ Gingras et al . , 2005 ] . One of these is essentially coextensive with Block 1 of the I / LWEQ module . However this vinculin - binding site is unlikely to be a focal adhesion localization signal as the truncation mutants T1 – T3 lack Block 1 but target well to focal adhesions . In addition , recent work has found three phosphorylation sites for human platelet talin in vivo that are within or proximal to the I / LWEQ module [ Ratnikov et al . , 2005 ] . This suggests that phosphorylation may also be a key mediator of the actin binding and focal adhesion targeting of Talin1 . Furthermore , calpain - 2 - mediated proteolysis of Talin1 affects both integrin activa - tion [ Calderwood et al . , 1999 ; Yan et al . , 2001 ; Tadokoro et al . , 2003 ] and focal adhesion disassembly [ Franco et al . , 2004b ] , which raises the possibility that proteolysis of talin provides a potential mechanism for regulating the signaling and structural functions of Talin1 in adhesion complexes . Since Talin1 is a dimer and the I / LWEQ mod - ule contains a dimerization motif [ Senetar et al . , 2004 ] , it is possible that focal adhesion targeting of the Talin1 I / LWEQ module could be due to heterodimerization with endogenous Talin1 . However , we have found that I / LWEQ 578 Franco et al . module mutants defective in dimerization are nevertheless targeted to focal adhesions ( S . J . Smith and R . O . McCann , unpublished results ) . These results imply that focal adhe - sion targeting is an intrinsic property of the Talin1 I / LWEQ module . Further studies of the C - terminus of Talin1 will be required to identify how Talin1 is targeted to focal adhesions and how actin binding and focal adhe - sion localization are coupled with other Talin1 functions in the full - length protein in vivo . Additional studies focus - ing on the pathways that regulate Talin1 localization may provide insight into some of the mechanisms underlying integrin - mediated adhesion .
