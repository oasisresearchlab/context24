CT recognizes cell surface receptors through its B subunit ( CTB ) . While the ganglioside GM1 has been historically described as the sole receptor , CTB is also capable of binding to fucosylated glycoconjugates , and fucosylated molecules have been shown to play a functional role in host cell intoxication by CT . Here , we use colonic epithe - lial and respiratory epithelial cell lines to examine how two types of CT receptors—gangliosides and fucosylated glycoconjugates—contribute to CTB internalization . We show that fucosylated glycoconjugates contribute to CTB binding to and internalization into host cells , even when the ganglio - side GM1 is present . The contributions of the two classes of receptors to CTB internalization depend on cell type . Additionally , in a cell line that harbours both classes of receptors , gangliosides dictate the efficiency of CTB internal - ization . Together , the results lend support to the idea that fucosylated glycoconjugates play a functional role in CTB internalization , and suggest that CT internalization depends on both receptor identity and cell type . 1 . Introduction Cholera is caused by the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio cholerae [ 1 ] . Vibrio cholerae produces a protein toxin composed of A and B subunits , which form an AB 5 complex . Cholera toxin ( CT ) binds to and invades host intestinal epithelial cells . Host cell surface molecules are recognized by the B subunit , facilitating cell entry by the A subunit , which activates adenylate cyclase , thereby leading to massive ion and fluid secretion . In the early 1970s , the ganglioside GM1 was identified as a high - affinity binding partner for cholera toxin subunit B ( CTB ) [ 2 , 3 ] . Further work showed that the addition of GM1 to CT - resistant cells con - fers susceptibility to intoxication [ 4 , 5 ] . The binding of CTB to the glycan headgroup of GM1 has been extensively characterized through various methods , demonstrating the interaction to be of high affinity with a nanomolar or picomolar K d [ 6 – 8 ] . Further , structural analysis by X - ray crystallography has revealed the molecular details of CTB recognition of the GM1 glycan [ 9 , 10 ] . Based on this body of data , GM1 has been historically recognized as the sole receptor for CT [ 11 ] . Nonetheless , analysis of the glycosphingolipid compo - sition of the normal human small intestinal epithelium , the physiological target for toxin action , revealed a surprisingly small amount of GM1 [ 12 ] , call - ing into question the idea that GM1 is the sole functional receptor for CT . Further , B4galnt1 - null mice lack GM1 but exhibit a stronger physiological response to CT than wild - type littermates , indicating that host GM1 is not required for CT action in vivo [ 13 ] . & 2019 The Authors .

Epidemiological studies have implicated fucosylated ABO blood group antigens in determining the severity of cholera [ 14 – 17 ] , and several reports showed that these blood group antigens could bind directly to different CTB variants [ 18 , 19 ] . We found that fucose ( Fuc ) is a key recognition determinant for CT binding to two human intestinal epithelial cell lines ( T84 and Colo205 ) : inhibition of fucosylation ( using metabolic inhibitor 2 - fluoro - peracetyl - fucose ( 2F - Fuc ) [ 20 ] ) dramatically reduces CTB binding to cells , largely blocks CTB entry into cells and reduces the ability of CT to raise intracellular cAMP levels , a key mechanistic step in host cell intoxication [ 21 ] . GM1 - independent CT intoxication could be completely inhib - ited by brefeldin A , implying that this process relies on trafficking through the secretory pathway [ 13 , 21 ] . Additional experiments demonstrated a role for fucose in CTB binding to primary human epithelial cells [ 13 , 21 ] , indicating that the cell culture results are unlikely to be an artefact of performing experiments in immortalized cell lines . Recognition of fucose by CTB was confirmed by co - crystal structures between CTB and difucosylated ABO blood group glycans , revealing a novel fucosylated glycan binding site distinct from the pre - viously identified GM1 site [ 22 , 23 ] , and by recent glycan array data that demonstrate CTB binding to biantennary , fuco - sylated human milk oligosaccharides ( HMOs ) [ 24 ] . Binding studies indicate that the interaction of CTB with fucosylated glycans has a much lower affinity than the CTB – GM1 inter - action , with difucosylated blood group antigens exhibiting K d values in the low millimolar range [ 19 , 22 , 23 , 25 ] . However , the functional significance of fucose recognition by CTB is underscored by observations that a variety of fucosylated mol - ecules , as well as a fucose - recognizing lectin , competitively interfere with CTB binding to intestinal epithelial cell lines and primary cells [ 13 , 21 , 25 ] . With the knowledge that CT can use two classes of receptors—gangliosides and fucosylated glycoconjugates— we decided to evaluate how CT internalization is affected by receptor identity . We examined two cell lines that harbour different sets of endogenous CTB receptors . Using synthetic glycobiology approaches , we altered the receptor composition of each cell line and tested the effects on CTB binding and internalization . The results confirm that fucosylated glycocon - jugates function in CTB binding and internalization , and demonstrate that internalization of CTB depends on both the receptor identity and the cellular context . 2 . Results 2 . 1 . Manipulation of cholera toxin subunit B receptor display through synthetic glycobiology As described in detail below , we assessed CTB binding and internalization in two cell lines . First , we used T84 colonic epithelial cells , which are similar to the physiological target cells of CT and contain little endogenous GM1 [ 21 ] . Second , we used a respiratory epithelial cell line , HBEC3 , which shares some characteristics with intestinal epithelial cells [ 26 ] . Cross - linking data imply that GM1 is present in HBEC3 cells [ 21 ] . Both T84 and HBEC3 cells produce fucosy - lated glycoconjugates . To evaluate the relative roles of gangliosides and fucosylated glycoconjugates in CTB intern - alization , we took a synthetic glycobiology approach , using small molecule reagents to inhibit biosynthesis of each class of receptors . To inhibit biosynthesis of gangliosides including GM1 , we used NB - DGJ , which interferes with addition of glucose to ceramide and thereby blocks synthesis of ganglio - sides [ 27 ] . We have previously observed that 17 m g ml 2 1 NB - DGJ is sufficient to substantially reduce levels of glucosylceramide - based glycolipids in T84 cells [ 21 ] . To inhi - bit biosynthesis of fucosylated glycoconjugates , we used 2F - Fuc , a metabolic inhibitor that results in global fucosyla - tion decrease [ 20 ] . When included in cell culture media at 200 m M , 2F - Fuc nearly eliminates binding of a fucose - recognizing lectin to glycoconjugates from T84 [ 21 ] and HBEC ( data not shown ) cells . We also increased the ganglio - side levels in both cell types by exogenous addition of GM1 . While we had some concern about whether exogenously added GM1 would incorporate correctly into the plasma membrane and function in the same way as endogenous GM1 , a number of prior reports had shown that exogenously added GM1 is a functional receptor for CT [ 2 , 4 , 28 ] . We also attempted to increase fucosylation levels by culturing the cells in media supplemented with L - fucose [ 29 ] , but did not observe an increase in fucosylation levels of the cell lines examined here . Therefore , we relied solely on inhibition of fucosylation with 2F - Fuc to evaluate the role of fucosylated glycoconjugates in CTB internalization . 2 . 2 . Cholera toxin subunit B binds to both gangliosides and glycoproteins in lung epithelial cells CTB binds to cell surface receptors at 4 8 C but is not interna - lized . To capture interactions between CTB and cell surface receptors , we used a cell - permeable precursor sugar ( Ac 4 ManNDAz ) that can be metabolized to a photocross - linking sialic acid analogue ( SiaDAz ) and incorporated into both glycoproteins and glycolipids in place of natural sialic acids [ 30 ] . Following UV irradiation , CTB cross - linksto cell sur - face receptorsthat contain the modified SiaDAz ( figure 1 a ) [ 21 ] . Because thecross - linker isattached to sialicacid , onlysialylated receptors will be captured and any non - sialylated receptors will be invisible in this analysis . The cross - linked complexes can be separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate – polyacrylamide gelelectrophoresis ( SDS – PAGE ) andvisualizedbyCTB immu - noblot . The size of the complex and its sensitivity to glycosylation inhibitors provides information about the iden - tity of the glycoconjugate to which CTB is cross - linked . Prior work has shownthat thespeciesthat migratesat approximately 13 kDa and is absent in cells cultured with NB - DGJ corre - sponds to CTB cross - linked to GM1 [ 31 ] . Similarly , higher molecular weight species that are reduced in intensity when cells are cultured with 2F - Fuc correspond to CTB cross - linked to fucosylated glycoproteins [ 13 , 21 ] . Here , we use SiaDAz cross - linking to assess types of CTB binding partners present in T84 and HBEC3 cells . As observed previously [ 21 ] , no cross - linking of CTB to GM1 gangliosides was detected in T84cells ( figure 1 b ) . However , CTB cross - linking tohighermol - ecular weight glycoconjugates was observed , and was reduced when fucosylation was inhibited ( figure 1 d ) . As observed pre - viously [ 21 ] , two types of CTB cross - linked complexes were present in HBEC3 cells . The intensity of a lower molecular weight species was dramatically reduced when cells were cul - tured with NB - DGJ ( figure 1 c ) , suggesting that this band represents CTB cross - linked to gangliosides such as GM1 , while the higher molecular weight complex was sensitive to 2F - Fuc treatment ( figure 1 e ) and likely represents CTB r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s f s I n t e r f a c e F o c u s 9 : 20180076 2 cross - linked to glycoproteins , at least some of which are fucosy - lated . These data demonstrate that HBEC3 cells , unlike T84 cells , contain endogenous gangliosides that can bind to and cross - link to CTB . Further , inhibitors of glycosylation can be used to control the set of CTB receptors present in HBEC3 cells with NB - DGJ inhibiting ganglioside biosynthesis but having no effect on fucosylated glycoproteins , and 2F - Fuc inhibiting fucosylation but not ganglioside biosynthesis . 2 . 3 . Gangliosides regulate cholera toxin subunit B internalization in lung epithelial cells To enable CTB cell surface binding but not internalization , biotinylated CTB was added to cells on ice ( 4 8 C ) . CTB cell surface binding was measured by a modified cell - based enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) technique and was referred to as ‘on’ [ 32 ] . However , not all CTB bind - ing events lead to cellular uptake [ 28 ] . Therefore , we also incubated cells at 37 8 C for a defined period of time to allow CTB internalization to occur . The amount of CTB internalized was measured by an in - cell ELISA method and was referred to as ‘in’ [ 32 ] . To test if endogenous gangliosides serve as func - tional CTB receptors , we measured the effect of NB - DGJ treatment on CTB binding and internalization . NB - DGJ treat - ment reduced CTB binding to HBEC3 cells significantly and to T84 cells minimally ( figure 2 a ) , consistent with CTB – ganglioside cross - linking observed in HBEC3 but not T84 cells ( figure 1 b , c ) . NB - DGJ treatment also reduced CTB intern - alization in HBEC3 cells in a concentration - dependent manner ( figure 2 b ( ii ) ) , but had minimal effect on CTB internalization in Ac 4 ManNDAz Ac 4 ManNDAz T84 cells – + + – – + + – – – + + – – + + – + + – – + + – – – + + – + + – – – + + – – + + – + + – – – + + – + + – – + + – – – + + – – + + HBEC3 cells covalentlycross - linked glycolipid – CTB complex covalentlycross - linked glycoprotein – CTB complex T84 cells HBEC3 cells NB - DGJ 2F - Fuc 15 10 CTB ACT Ac 4 ManNDAz NB - DGJ 2F - Fuc 250 150100 50 25 CTB ACT Ac 4 ManNDAz NB - DGJ 2F - Fuc 250 150100 50 25 CTB ACT Ac 4 ManNDAz NB - DGJ 2F - Fuc 15 10 CTB ACT SiaDAz glycoproteinor glycolipid immunoblotwith anti - CTB CTB CTB + UV – UV SiaDAz - modified glycoconjugate + h n ( 365 nm ) cholera toxin subunit B ( CTB ) glycosylation inhibitors cross - linked glycoprotein covalentcrosslink cross - linked glycolipid ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) ( e ) Figure 1 . CTB cross - links to endogenous gangliosides in lung but not colonic epithelial cells . ( a ) Cells cultured with Ac 4 ManNDAz produce SiaDAz , a photocross - linking sugar that can be incorporated into glycoproteins and glycolipids in place of naturally occurring sialic acid . Cross - linking to fucosylated glycoproteins and to gangliosides can be assessed by evaluating the mobility of cross - linked CTB complexes by immunoblot , and by evaluating the sensitivity of cross - linking to inhibition by 2F - Fuc ( for fucosylated glycoproteins ) and NB - DGJ ( for gangliosides ) . ( b ) T84 cells were cultured with Ac 4 ManNDAz or ethanol in the presence or absence of 200 m M 2F - Fuc or 40 m g ml 2 1 NB - DGJ for 3 days .

We also calculated internalization effi - ciency , which is the fraction of bound CTB that is internalized ( i . e . in / on ) [ 33 ] . NB - DGJ treatment decreased CTB internalization efficiency in HBEC3 cells ( figure 2 c ( ii ) ) but did not affect CTB internalization efficiency in T84 cells ( figure 2 c ( i ) ) . Thus , and in agreement with earlier studies [ 21 ] , these data suggest that gangliosides do not contribute substantially to CTB cell surface binding or internalization in T84 cells . However , in HBEC3 cells , gangliosides are important contributors to CTB cell surface binding and internalization , and CTB internalization efficiency decreases when gangliosides are absent . 2 . 4 .

With the observation that CTB cross - links to both gangliosides and fucosylated glycoproteins in HBEC3 cells ( figure 1 c , e ) , we wanted to test how the inhibition of fucosylation affected CTB binding to and internalization in cells that contain endogenous gangliosides . As reported previously [ 21 ] , T84 cells cultured with 200 m M 2F - Fuc showed a robust decrease in CTB cell surface binding and internalization ( figure 3 a ( i ) , b ( i ) ) . In HBEC3 cells , 2F - Fuc also reduced CTB cell surface binding and internalization in a concentration - dependent manner ( figure 3 a ( ii ) , b ( ii ) ) . While the inhibition of fucosylation resulted in decreased CTB internalization efficiency in T84 cells ( figure 3 c ( i ) ) , it had no meaningful effect on CTB intern - alization efficiency in HBEC3 cells ( figure 3 c ( ii ) ) . Taken together , the results in figures 2 and 3 show that gangliosides control the efficiency of CTB endocytosis in HBEC3 cells ( even in the presence of fucosylated receptors ) and that fuco - sylation determines the efficiency of CTB endocytosis in T84 cells ( which lack measurable quantities of CTB binding gangliosides ) . 0 200 0 20 40 60 80 100 on ( % c on t r o l ) 2F - Fuc ( m M ) * * * * 0 100 200 400 0 20 40 60 80 100 2F - Fuc ( m M ) on ( % c on t r o l ) * * * * * * * * * 0 15 30 45 60 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 20 40 60 80 100 time ( min ) 0 15 30 45 60 time ( min ) 0 15 30 45 60 time ( min ) 0 15 30 45 60 time ( min ) i n ( % 60 m i n c on t r o l ) 0 20 40 60 80 100 i n ( % 60 m i n c on t r o l ) 0200 2F - Fuc ( m M ) 0100200400 2F - Fuc ( m M ) 0200 2F - Fuc ( m M ) 0100200400 2F - Fuc ( m M ) * * * * * * n . s . * * * * * * * * i n / on ( % ) i n / on ( % ) T84 HBEC3 ( a ) ( i ) ( ii ) ( b ) ( i ) ( ii ) ( c ) ( i ) ( ii ) Figure 3 .

Exogenous GM1 is a functional cholera toxin receptor We wondered whether fucosylation determines endocytic efficiency in T84 cells simply because they lack gangliosides like GM1 [ 21 ] . Exogenously added GM1 can be incorporated into the plasma membrane of cells and results in increased sensitivity of cells to the toxin [ 2 , 4 , 34 ] . We next asked whether exogenously added GM1 could control the efficiency of CTB endocytosis in either or both cell lines . Upon adding GM1 exogenously , we observed that CTB cell surface binding increased in both T84 and HBEC3 cells in a concentration - dependent manner ( figure 4 a ) . At the highest GM1 concentration ( 40 m g ml 2 1 ) , we observed an approximately 10 - fold increase in CTB binding to T84 cells and an approximately fivefold increase in CTB binding to HBEC3 cells . Unfortunately , GM1 can adhere to the cell culture dishes in the absence of cells ( data not shown ) . Therefore , some frac - tion of the observed CTB binding ( figure 4 a ) could be due to CTB binding to GM1 adhered to the cell culture plate . How - ever , GM1 treatment also resulted in increased CTB internalization in both T84 and HBEC3 cells ( figure 4 b ) . If any GM1 adhered to the plate , it was removed in the acid wash step of the in - cell ELISA or not detected because the CTB – biotin bound to it is blocked with avidin . Therefore , the observed internalization ( figure 4 b ) can be fully attributed to GM1 that has incorporated into plasma membranes of cells . Nonetheless because we could not ascertain with cer - tainty the amount of CTB that was binding to the cell culture dish versus cells ( even with complete cell confluency ) , we decided not to calculate CTB internalization efficiency in the case of GM1 treatment . To further assess whether CTB internalization promoted by exogenously added GM1 was functionally relevant , we measured the ability of CT to raise intracellular cAMP levels under these conditions . In both T84 and HBEC3 cells , GM1 treatment increased the CT - induced cAMP accumulation , implying that GM1 pro - motes CTB internalization that is on - pathway to host cell intoxication ( figure 4 c ) . Taken together , these results demon - strate that at least some fraction of exogenously added GM1 inserts in the plasma membrane , where it acts as a functional receptor that promotes CTB internalization and CT host cell intoxication in both cell types . 2 . 6 . Fucosylated glycans contribute to cholera toxin subunit B internalization , even in the presence of GM1 Having observed that exogenously added GM1 resulted in increased CTB cell surface binding and internalization in T84 cells , we next interrogated the role that endogenous receptors play in controlling CTB binding and internalization in these cells . We used 2F - Fuc treatment to create T84 cells where endogenous fucosylated receptors were either present or absent , and then added increasing concentrations of GM1 to both . As observed previously ( figure 3 a ) [ 21 ] , 2F - Fuc treat - ment results in decreased CTB binding ; this decrease was still observed in the presence of low concentrations ( 5 , 10 m g ml 2 1 ) of GM1 , but was eliminated at higher ( 20 , 40 , 80 m g ml 2 1 ) GM1 concentrations ( figure 5 a ) . Thus , at low GM1 concentrations , both fucosylated glycoconjugates and GM1 contribute to CTB binding . However , at high GM1 concentrations , GM1 is the dominant binding partner , consistent with the higher affinity of CTB for GM1 when compared with fucosylated structures [ 7 , 19 , 22 , 23 , 25 , 35 , 36 ] . We also measured CTB internalization under these con - ditions . As observed previously [ 21 ] , in the absence of exogenous GM1 , the inhibition of fucosylation nearly elimi - nated CTB internalization ( figures 3 c and 5 b ) . The inhibition of fucosylation also significantly reduced CTB internalization when exogenous GM1 was added , even at the highest GM1 concentrations—40 and 80 m g ml 2 1 ( figure 5 b ) . Taken together , these data indicate that CTB internalization in T84 cells is at least partially regulated by endogenous fucosylated glycoconjugates , even when the high - affinity GM1 receptor is present . 2 . 7 . Gangliosides and fucosylated glycoconjugates are not the only cholera toxin subunit B receptors We next wondered if fucosylated glycoconjugates and gangliosides are the only CTB receptors . To test this idea , we treated HBEC3 cells with concentrations of NB - DGJ and 2F - Fuc that had yielded maximal inhibitory effects on CTB binding ( figures 2 and 3 ) . NB - DGJ and 2F - Fuc individually blocked CTB cell surface binding and internalization ( figure 6 a , b ) . Co - treatment with both inhibitors did not result in a statistically significant decrease in CTB when com - pared with either single inhibitor treatment ( figure 6 a ) . However , CTB internalization was further decreased by co - treatment with NB - DGJ and 2F - Fuc , when compared with the individual treatments ( figure 6 b ) . While 2F - Fuc by itself did not reduce CTB internalization efficiency , cells treated with both NB - DGJ and 2F - Fuc displayed less efficient CTB internalization when compared with cells treated with NB - DGJ alone ( figure 6 c ) . Thus , when both types of receptors are present , gangliosides appear to play the dominant role in determining the efficiency of CTB internalization . None - theless , even with NB - DGJ and 2F - Fuc co - treatment , CTB internalization was not completely blocked , suggesting that functional CTB receptors may remain present on the surface of these cells . 3 . Discussion Here , we investigated the contributions of different classes of receptors to CTB internalization in two cell lines . Our exper - imental design allowed us to independently assess the roles of gangliosides and fucosylated glycoconjugates , albeit with some limitations . The metabolic inhibitor 2F - Fuc allowed us to eliminate fucosylated receptors . NB - DGJ treatment reduced ganglioside production in HBEC3 cells , but it was difficult to assess the effect of NB - DGJ in T84 cells because we cannot easily detect GM1 in these cells . We were able to increase ganglioside levels in both cell lines through the addition of exogenous GM1 . We showed that this added GM1 was a func - tional receptor for CT , although we cannot exclude the possibility that some fraction of the added GM1 behaves differ - ently from endogenous GM1 . Despite this limitation , we determined that fucosylated glycoconjugates are important mediators of CTB endocytosis in T84 cells , even in the presence of GM1 . Additionally , in HBEC3 cells , we were able to assess how the two classes of inhibitors contribute to CTB internaliz - ation efficiency . In this cell type , both gangliosides and r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s f s I n t e r f a c e F o c u s 9 : 20180076 6 fucosylated glycoconjugates contribute to CTB internalization with gangliosides playing a more important role in determin - ing the efficiency of CTB internalization ( figures 2 c , 3 c and 6 c ) . If gangliosides and fucosylated glycoconjugates are acting as independent receptors , this result would suggest that ganglio - sides are more efficient at internalizing CTB than fucosylated glycoconjugates are . It is noteworthy that GM1 is a high - affinity CTB binder , while the fucosylated ligands for CTB thus far identified are much lower affinity [ 22 , 23 , 25 ] . Nonethe - less , CTB binding studies demonstrate that low - affinity ligands can contribute to recognition even in the presence of a much higher affinity ligand [ 37 ] . The results presented here show that CTB can enter T84 cells ( which have little GM1 ) as well as HBEC3 cells treated with NB - DGJ to reduce GM1 levels . These results lend additional support to the idea that fucosylated glycoconju - gates function as receptors that mediate host cell intoxication by CT [ 21 ] . It remains possible that T84 cells and HBEC3 cells treated with NB - DGJ each contain some low level of GM1 . We did not perform a genetic knockout of GM1 biosynthesis here , but studies in mice lacking B4galnt1 ( an enzyme required for GM1 biosynthesis ) demon - strate that GM1 is not required for intoxication by CT [ 13 ] .

These results imply that cau - tion should be applied when using CTB to detect the presence or localization of GM1 , as the expression level of both GM1 and other CTB binding partners will vary among different cell lines [ 38 – 40 ] . In T84 cells , the addition of exogenous GM1 resulted in a strong increase in CTB cell surface binding but only a modest increase in CTB internal - ization . A possible interpretation of this result is that the fucosylated glycoconjugates present in these cells could be efficient CTB receptors . Alternatively , fucosylated glycoconjugates and GM1 may work together in CTB intern - alization , by acting either in concert or sequentially . Finally , although we showed that exogenously added GM1 is a func - tional receptor ( figure 4 c ) , this added GM1 could behave differently from endogenously produced GM1 . Indeed , GM1 can also be produced in the course of cholera infection through the action of V . cholerae neuraminidase , which removes sialic acid from glycoconjugates in intestinal epi - thelial cells , thereby revealing endogenous GM1 [ 41 , 42 ] . Future studies will assess how GM1 produced through V . cholerae neuraminidase treatment affects the CTB internalization . The critical role for fucosylated glycoconjugates in CTB internalization is supported by the cross - linking studies ( figure 1 d , e ) and by the effects of 2F - Fuc on CTB internaliz - ation ( figures 3 and 5 ) . We observed fucose - dependent cross - linking of CTB to high molecular weight species , which are assumed to be glycoproteins . However , fucosy - lated glycoconjugates that lack sialic acid would not be observed in the cross - linking analysis , but could contribute to the changes in CTB binding and internalization observed with 2F - Fuc treatment . Therefore , additional fucosylated gly - coproteins or fucosylated glycolipids may be present in these cells . We postulate that the fucosylated CTB receptor might not be a single molecule , but could represent a diverse set of molecules that exhibit distinct CTB binding and internaliz - ation characteristics . In future work , we aim to identify these distinct fucosylated species and assess their contributions to CTB endocytosis and to host cell intoxication by CT . Further , in HBEC3 cells , measurable CTB binding and internalization occurred even with co - treatment with NB - DGJ and 2F - Fuc . This result could reflect the incomplete inhibition of fucosy - lated glycoconjugate and / or ganglioside biosynthesis . Alternatively , the residual internalization may suggest the existence of an additional class of non - ganglioside , non - fucosylated CT receptors , consistent with our prior studies of mouse intestinal epithelial cells [ 13 ] . Thus , CT , like other bacterial toxins [ 43 – 45 ] , may have evolved to exploit multiple host receptors . 0 5 10 20 40 80 0 2 . 0 0 0 60 time ( min ) time ( min ) 45 30 15 0 60 45 30 15 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 1 2 3 4 510152025 GM1 ( m g ml – 1 ) GM1 ( m g ml – 1 ) + DMSO 0 804020105 GM1 ( m g ml – 1 ) + 2F - Fuc 0 804020105 DMSO on ( a r b . un it s ) 2F - Fuc * * * * * * * * i n ( a r b . un it s ) i n ( a r b . un it s ) * * * * * * ( a ) ( b ) ( i ) ( ii ) Figure 5 .

After culturing for 72 h , the medium in each well was replaced with 1 ml fresh medium containing approximately 4 . 5 m g of CTB ( Sigma ) for 45 min at 4 8 C in the dark . The cells were then either kept at 4 8 C for an additional 45 min ( for – UV samples ) or irradiated on an ice / water bath ( at approx . 4 8 C ) for 45 min ( for þ UV samples ) at 365 nm . Wells were washed twice with PBS , lysed using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer and incubated on ice for 30 – 60 min . The lysate was centrifuged at 21 000 g for 10 min at 4 8 C to remove insoluble debris , and the supernatant was retained for separation on both a higher ( 15 – 20 % ) and lower ( 6 % ) percentage polyacrylamide gel . The samples were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride ( PVDF ) membrane , and the blots were probed overnight at 4 8 C for anti - CT ( Sigma ; 1 : 10 000 dilution ) . Membranes were re - probed for the loading control anti - b - actin ( Cell Signaling Technology ; 1 : 5000 dilution ) . 4 . 5 . Immunoblot Twenty micrograms of T84 and HBEC3 cell lysates were separated by SDS – PAGE . After overnight transfer to PVDF membrane , the membrane was blocked with Tris - buffered saline buffer with 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ( TBST ) containing 3 % BSA at room temperature for 1 h , followed by incubation with primary antibodies ( diluted with TBST containing 3 % BSA ) on a rocker at 4 8 C overnight . After three washes with TBST , the membrane was incubated with the relevant secondary antibodies ( goat anti - mouse or goat anti - rabbit ; 1 : 10 000 dilution ) in TBST containing 1 % BSA for 1 h . The membranes were washed three times with TBST and then images were developed with SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate ( Thermo - Fisher Scientific , catalogue no . 34095 ) for 1 min , then imaged with a ChemiDoc MP Imaging system ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA , USA ) . 4 . 6 . Cholera toxin subunit B cell surface binding assay ( on - cell ELISA ) T84 and HBEC3 cells ( 25 000 / well ) were cultured in medium in the absence or presence of each inhibitor in individual wells of a 96 - well plate ( Costar , catalogue no . 9102 ) for 3 days . In a typical experiment , four samples ( wells ) were prepared for each con - dition . On the day of the experiment , cells were washed three times in cold PBS , and further incubated with 4 m g ml 2 1 of bio - tinylated CTB in PBS4 þ ( 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) BSA and 5 mM glucose ) for 30 min on ice . Unbound biotin – CTB was washed away three times in cold PBS . Then cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min on ice and 20 min at room temperature . After three washes with PBS , cells were blocked for 20 min with Q - PBS ( PBS supplemented with 0 . 01 % ( w / v ) sapo - nin , 2 % ( w / v ) BSA and 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) lysine , pH 7 . 4 ) . The cells were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h in streptavi - din – HRP ( 1 : 10 000 ; Roche ) conjugate diluted in Q - PBS . HRP activity was measured by a stopped colorimetric assay using ortho - phenylenediamine as a substrate . Light absorption at 490 nm was determined with a Synergy Neo microplate reader ( BioTek , Winooski , VT , USA ) and all values were corrected by light absorbance at 650 nm and normalized by total cell protein content ( bicinchoninic acid assay ; BCA protein assay kit ; Pierce ) . Four replicate samples from a single experiment were averaged together . Data presented represent three experiments ( four repli - cates each ) performed on separate days . 4 . 7 . Cholera toxin subunit B internalization assay ( in - cell ELISA ) CTB internalization was measured by the on - cell ELISA , described above , with the following adaptations . During the experiment , control samples ( to measure total surface - bound biotin – CTB ) were washed three times with ice - cold PBS , then kept on ice awaiting analysis . Experimental samples were warmed to 37 8 C for the indicated times ( 0 , 15 , 30 and 60 min ) to allow endocytic uptake , then endocytosis was halted by returning cells to ice and washing three times with cold PBS . Non - internalized biotinylated CTB was masked by successive treatment with 50 m g ml 2 1 of avidin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 1 h on ice , followed by three 1 min cold acid washes ( 0 . 2 M acetic acid / 0 . 2 M NaCl ) . Cells were then washed six times with cold PBS and were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and further per - meabilized with 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 in PBS for 15 min . After three washes with PBS , cells were blocked for 20 min with Q - PBS . Cells were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h in streptavidin – HRP conjugate diluted in Q - PBS . Reactive aldehydes and non - specific binding sites were quenched with Q - PBS . HRP activity was measured as described above . To combine data from multiple experiments , we normalized the ‘in’ values to the control 60 min internalization time point . 4 . 8 . Cholera toxin subunit B internalization efficiency ( in / on ) To measure CTB internalization efficiency , the fraction of interna - lized CTB ( at 37 8 C ) relative to the initial total surface bound ligand at 4 8 C ( without the acid wash step ) was calculated ( both cell surface binding and internalization were measured in paral - lel for all the assays ) . At the end of CTB binding and internalization assays , the corrected data obtained by colori - metric assay ( measured at 490 nm and corrected with the 650 nm data ) were normalized to the total protein content measured by the bicinchoninic acid assay . The values obtained in cells incubated at time 0 were subtracted from the four time points ( 0 , 15 , 30 and 60 min ) . The resultant values provided the ratio or efficiency of CTB internalized at a given time point to the amount of CTB bound to the cell surface . 4 . 9 . cAMP measurement One hundred microlitres of 50 000 cells ml 2 1 cell suspensions of individual cell lines were added in wells in white - walled 96 - well plates ( Thermo - Fisher Scientific , catalogue no . 07 - 200 - 628 ) and cultured for 72 h . The wells were washed twice with PBS and then treated with 0 . 1 nM CT holotoxin at 37 8 C for 60 min ( List Biologicals ) in complete induction buffer provided in the cAMP - Glo kit ( Promega , catalogue no . V1501 ) . The assay was performed following the manufacturer’s protocol ( cAMP - Glo assay ; Promega ) .
