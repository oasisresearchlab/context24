Crystalline domains embedded in ﬂuid membrane vesicles are studied by Monte Carlo simulations of dynamically triangulated surfaces and by scaling arguments . A budding transition from a caplike state to a budded shape is observed for increasing spontaneous curvature C 0 of the crystalline domain as well as increasing line tension l . The location of the budding transition is determined as a function of C 0 , l , and the radius R A of the crystalline domain . In contrast to previous theoretical predictions , it is found that budding occurs at a value of the spontaneous curvature C 0 , that is always a decreasing function of the domain size R A . Several characteristic scaling regimes are predicted . The distribution of ﬁve - and sevenfold disclinations as the budding transition is approached is determined , and the dynamics of the generation of defects is studied .

INTRODUCTION The primary new feature in two - component—compared to single - component—ﬂuids is the possibility of phase sepa - ration . Canonically , mixtures have a lower miscibility gap , that is , the system is homogeneously mixed at high tempera - tures , but demixes at low temperatures into two coexisting phases that are enriched in one of the two components . How - ever , upper miscibility gaps and closed coexistence loops also exist , typically in systems in which the hydrophobic effect is important . The inverted phase behavior of these sys - tems is due to the orientational degrees of freedom of the water molecules , which are distributed isotropically at high temperatures , but have a preferred orientation in the neigh - borhood of polar solutes . It is therefore natural to expect phase separation in two - component amphiphilic membranes . Indeed , phase separa - tion in Langmuir monolayers at the water - air interface has been well documented for many years , and has been inves - tigated in considerable detail @ 1 , 2 # . However , in bilayer membranes , phase separation turns out to be much more dif - ﬁcult to observe . Initial evidence showed gel - ﬂuid coexist - ence in some systems @ 3 # , while ﬂuid - ﬂuid coexistence re - mained elusive for a long time . Only very recently have experiments using three - component membranes revealed very clear and convincing evidence for both gel - ﬂuid @ 4 , 5 # and ﬂuid - ﬂuid @ 6 , 7 # coexistence . The coupling of phase separation and membrane shape in ﬂexible bilayer membranes opens the possibility for the bud - ding of domains @ 8 , 9 # . The physical mechanism of this phe - nomenon is the competition between the line tension energy of the phase boundary and the curvature energy of the mem - brane . Since the curvature energy is scale invariant , so that the curvature energy of a spherical vesicle is independent of the vesicle radius , and the line tension energy is proportional to the domain perimeter , i . e . , to the domain radius , it is im - mediately clear that a budding transition occurs when the domain radius R is on the order of k / l , where k is the bend - ing rigidity and l is the line tension . Similarly , a membrane patch with spontaneous curvature C 0 has a budding transi - tion at R ; 1 / C 0 . The coexistence of two phases in biological membranes has also received considerable attention recently . The exis - tence of ‘‘lipid rafts’’ @ 10 # may indeed play an important role in the control of the activity of membrane proteins . Another kind of two - phase coexistence in biological membranes oc - curs when domains of adsorbed proteins form spontaneously . A famous , and biologically very important , example is the adsorption of clathrin molecules on the plasma membrane @ 11 # . Clathrin molecules assemble to form a regular hexago - nal network on the membrane surface @ 12 – 14 # . By forming ﬁrst a coated pit and then a complete bud ~ see Fig . 1 ! , these clathrin coats control endo - and exocytosis , i . e . , the forma - tion and detachment of small transport vesicles from the cell membrane . The formation of clathrin cages is therefore an example of the budding of crystalline membrane patches em - bedded in a ﬂuid lipid membrane . * Permanent and present address : Department of Physics , Faculty of Education , Shiga University , Hiratsu 2 - 5 - 1 , Otsu , Shiga 520 - 0862 , Japan .

A ﬂat , crys - talline membrane cannot be deformed into a spherical bud without the introduction of topological defects . For the ge - neric case of a hexagonal lattice symmetry , the crystal con - sists of a network of sixfold coordinated vertices . In this case , Euler’s theorem requires an excess of exactly 12 ﬁve - fold coordinated vertices ~ or ﬁvefold disclinations ! to form a spherical cage . A disclination is a topological defect , because it cannot be generated locally , but requires the rearrangement of a large number of lattice sites . An important question , therefore , is how these ﬁvefold disclinations are generated inside the crystalline domain . Two principal mechanisms are possible . In the ﬁrst , the edge - acquisition mechanism , ﬁve - fold disclinations form at the edge of the crystalline domain and then diffuse into the interior @ 12 # . Diffusion proceeds through the production of a series of dislocations , which con - sist of nearest - neighbor pairs of ﬁve - and sevenfold disclina - tions . In the second , the interior - acquisition mechanism , dis - location pairs are generated in the interior of the crystalline patch . Each of these dislocations subsequently dissociates , leaving the ﬁvefold disclination in the interior of the patch while the sevenfold disclination diffuses to the domain boundary . Another possibility has been suggested for clathrin networks , in which ﬁvefold coordinated sites are formed through the addition of clathrin dimers to the interior of clathrin domains @ 15 # . The interior - acquisition mechanism has been studied in detail by Mashl and Bruinsma @ 16 # . They argue that budding occurs via dislocation unbinding , driven by changes in the spontaneous curvature of the clathrin and associated lipid membrane assembly . Mashl and Bruinsma estimate the cur - vature and stretching energies of a ﬁvefold disclination in the center the domain and a sevenfold disclination at distance r . With increasing C 0 , the minimum of their free - energy ansatz was found to move to larger values of r , until r 5 R A is reached at a critical value of the spontaneous curvature . This disclination unbinding allows the sevenfold disclination to move to the edge of the network , leaving behind the ﬁvefold disclination at the center . In this approach , budding occurs for R ; C 0 , which , surprisingly , is the inverse of the result for ﬂuid membranes . In this paper we present the results of a detailed study of the budding of crystalline domains in ﬂuid membrane vesicles , using both Monte Carlo simulations and scaling ar - guments . The membrane is described using a network model , and the location of the budding transition is determined as a function of the spontaneous curvature of the crystalline do - main , C 0 , the tension of the line separating the crystalline and ﬂuid domains , l , and the radius R A of the crystalline domain . The outline of the paper is as follows . The model and simulation technique is described in Sec . II . Simulation results for vesicle shapes , number and distribution of defects , and the budding phase diagram are presented in Sec . III , and it is shown that the budding transition occurs at a domain size R A which is always a decreasing function of the the spontaneous curvature C 0 for the range of parameters con - sidered . Analytical estimates for the line budding transitions as a function of the Young modulus , the bending rigidity , and the line tension are presented in Sec . IV . Four different scal - ing regimes are predicted , depending on the relative impor - tance of the bending and stretching energies and on the do - main size . A critical discussion of the analysis of Ref . @ 16 # is also presented . Results for the dynamics of the budding tran - sition are presented in Sec . VI . The paper closes with a brief discussion of the budding of clathrin - coated membranes . II . MODEL AND SIMULATION METHOD A . One - component membranes For our Monte Carlo simulations of crystalline domains in ﬂuid membranes we employ a tether - and - bead model of self - avoiding membranes @ 17 # . The model consists of N vertices which are connected by tethers to form a triangular network . Each vertex is the center of a hard sphere of diameter s 0 5 1 . The tethers do not restrict the motion of connected beads for distances smaller than the tether length , 0 , but do not allow the distance to exceed , 0 . A Monte Carlo step then consists of N attempted positional updates with displace - ments chosen randomly in the cube @ 2 s , s # 3 . For tether length , 0 , A 3 s 0 and sufﬁciently small step sizes s , this model mimics self - avoiding membranes , since the largest al - lowed space between the beads is too small for other beads to penetrate the membrane . In addition , in order to allow for diffusion and ﬂuidity within the membrane , the connectivity of the network must itself be a dynamic variable . This is usually achieved by cutting and reattaching the tethers con - necting the four beads of two neighboring triangles in such a way that the two beads which were not connected before are linked by a tether after the ﬂip . A Monte Carlo step also involves N attempted bond ﬂips . Tether - and - bead models have been used very successfully to study the shape and ﬂuctuations of ﬂuid vesicles @ 18 , 19 # , the passage of vesicles through narrow pores @ 20 # , and the budding dynamics of multicomponent ﬂuid membranes @ 21 # . In the current context , it is particularly interesting that it has been demonstrated that tether - and - bead models can be used to study the freezing transition of both planar @ 22 # and ﬂex - ible @ 23 # membranes , as well as of ﬂexible vesicles @ 24 , 25 # . In order to induce crystallization of the membrane , no modi - ﬁcation of the model is necessary . Instead , crystallization oc - curs automatically when the tether length becomes sufﬁ - ciently small . In the thermodynamic limit of very large networks , the ﬂuid phase has been found to be stable for , 0 / s 0 . 1 . 52 @ 22 # . The freezing transition proceeds in two steps , from the ﬂuid phase to a hexatic phase with quasi - long - range bond orien - tational but short - range translational order , and then to the crystalline phase with quasi - long - range translational order , in agreement with theoretical expectations @ 26 # . The hexatic phase is stable within a narrow range of tether lengths , 1 . 48 , , 0 / s 0 , 1 . 52 @ 22 # . For networks of ﬁnite size , the crystalline - to - hexatic and hexatic - to - ﬂuid transitions are shifted to effectively larger tether lengths . For a network with periodic boundary conditions , the crystalline phase has been found to be stable for , 0 / s 0 , 1 . 574 for N 5 100 , and for , 0 / s 0 , 1 . 545 for N 5 748 @ 22 # . KOHYAMA , KROLL , AND GOMPPER PHYSICAL REVIEW E 68 , 061905 ~ 2003 ! 061905 - 2 The shape and ﬂuctuations of ﬂuid membranes are con - trolled by the curvature energy @ 27 # H b 5 k 2 E dS ~ H 2 C 0 ! 2 , ~ 1 ! where k is the bending rigidity , H 5 c 1 1 c 2 is twice the mean curvature ~ with principal curvature c 1 and c 2 ) , and C 0 is the spontaneous curvature . For triangulated surfaces , several dis - cretizations of the curvature energy have been suggested @ 17 # . Here we employ the discretization proposed by Itzyk - son @ 28 # , which has been shown to work very well for ﬂuid membranes @ 29 # . In this case , the bending energy is given by H b 5 k 2 ( i s i F 1 s i ( j ( i ) s ij , ij ~ R i 2 R j ! 2 C 0 G 2 , ~ 2 ! where the sum over j ( i ) is over neighbors of vertex i . In Eq . ~ 2 ! , , ij is the distance between nodes i and j located at R i and R j , respectively , s ij 5 , ij @ cot ( u 1 ) 1 cot ( u 2 ) # / 2 is the length of a bond in the dual lattice , with angles u 1 and u 2 opposite to link ij in the two triangles sharing this bond , and s i 5 ( 1 / 4 ) ( j ( i ) s ij , ij is the area of the dual cell of vertex i . B . Two - component membranes The shape and ﬂuctuations of two - component ﬂuid mem - branes are again controlled by the curvature energy @ 27 # . In addition , there is a contribution from the line tension of the domain boundary . The total energy of a two - component membrane in the strong segregation limit is given by H 5 k A 2 E dS ~ H 2 C 0 A ! 2 1 k B 2 E dS ~ H 2 C 0 B ! 2 1 l R ds , ~ 3 ! where l is the line tension , and the bending rigidities k A and k B and spontaneous curvatures C 0 A and C 0 B are in general different for the two components . We assume for simplicity that the saddle - splay modulus k ¯ is the same for both compo - nents , so that the contribution of the Gaussian curvature is a constant and does not have to be considered . The tether - and - bead model has been generalized to mem - branes with two ﬂuid components . In this case , the two com - ponents A and B can be placed either on the surface triangles @ 21 # or on the vertices @ 30 , 31 # . In the ﬁrst case , the interac - tions of the two - component mixture can be described by an Ising Hamiltonian , where the binary spin variables describe the occupation of the triangles with either of the two com - ponents . Since the number of neighboring triangles is always 3 in this case , the energy of the domain boundary is propor - tional to the number of bonds at which A and B triangles meet and is therefore independent of the membrane shape near the domain boundary , as it should be @ 21 # . In contrast , when the Ising model with vertex occupation variables is used , the interaction energy depends on the number of neigh - bors . It is therefore favorable for the system to minimize the number of bonds which connect A and B vertices . Since the number of neighbors of a site is coupled to the local Gauss - ian curvature—with few neighbors implying a positive , and many neighbors a negative , Gaussian curvature—the dis - cretized curvature in combination with an Ising model with vertex variables may lead to artifacts . However , it is not difﬁcult to cure this problem with the vertex occupation variables . All that needs to be done is to use the length of the domain boundary instead of the number of bonds connecting A and B vertices . This is very natural in the Itzykson discretization of the curvature energy , since the variables s ij , which are the lengths of the bonds in the dual lattice , are already calculated anyway . The discretized ver - sion of the energy of the domain boundary is H l 5 l ( ^ ij & AB s ij , ~ 4 ! where ^ ij & AB denotes the bonds connecting A and B vertices . We want to study here crystalline domains in ﬂuid mem - branes . Therefore , we have to induce crystalline order in part of the membrane by choosing an appropriately small tether length . This implies that the tether length is not uniform and depends on the type of the two connected vertices . We chose two tether lengths , A and , B for the AA and BB bonds , respectively , and set , AB 5 ( , A 1 , B ) / 2 . In order to complete the deﬁnition of the model , we have to specify the parameters used in the simulations . We con - sider a membrane with bending rigidity k A 5 k B 5 k 5 10 k B T . The tether length of the ﬂuid B component is taken to be , B / s 0 5 1 . 68 , safely above the ﬂuid - to - hexatic transi - tion at , 0 / s 0 5 1 . 52 . The spontaneous curvature C 0 B van - ishes . For the crystalline A component , we vary the param - eters in the range 0 < C 0 A s 0 < 1 . 0 and 1 . 45 < , A / s 0 < 1 . 50 . In the following , we use C 0 [ C 0 A in order to simplify the notation . Finally , line tensions in the range 0 , l s 0 , 10 k B T are investigated . The simulations are performed for membranes of spherical topology , i . e . , for vesicles , in order to avoid boundary effects and to make sure that the surface tension vanishes identically . We study three different system sizes ( N A , N B ) 5 ( 92 , 612 ) , ( N A , N B ) 5 ( 184 , 1224 ) , and ( N A , N B ) 5 ( 368 , 2442 ) , so that the total number of vertices is N 5 704 , N 5 1408 , and N 5 2810 , respectively . This im - plies that the fraction x N of the number of A vertices in the total number of vertices is constant , with x N 5 0 . 1307 . For ﬁxed tether lengths , the ratio x 5 x N ( 1 1 , A ) 2 / ( 1 1 , B ) 2 of the area of the A component to the total vesicle area is there - fore also constant for the three system sizes . We have chosen a small area fraction x because we want to focus on the budding transition of an initially ~ almost ! planar domain in a ﬂuid membrane . Since one of the interesting applications of our model is the budding of clathrin - coated pits , we will often denote the crystalline A domain as the ‘‘clathrin domain’’ in the follow - ing . This does not imply that we are taking any particular properties of clathrin molecules into account . To simplify the notation , all lengths are measured in units of the bead diam - eter s 0 and all energies in units of the thermal energy k B T .

Vesicle shapes A sequence of typical vesicle shapes for ﬁxed spontane - ous curvature C 0 5 0 . 1 is shown in Fig . 2 . For small line tension , l 5 1 . 5 , the crystalline domain takes a caplike shape . Note that the domain boundary shows strong ﬂuctuations at this value of l , which indicates the vicinity of the mixing transition of the two components . For l 5 1 . 5 , the clathrin vertices remain connected during the length of a typical simulation run . For l 5 1 . 0 , however , some A vertices detach from the clathrin domain and ﬂoat as monomers inside the ﬂuid membrane . Since we are interested in the strong segre - gation regime , we therefore restrict all simulations to values of the line tension l > 1 . 5 . As the line tension increases , the crystalline domain be - gins to bend more strongly , while the ﬂuctuations of the do - main boundary decrease . Finally , at 3 , l , 5 , a budding tran - sition occurs , and the crystalline domain forms a complete bud . This scenario is very similar to the budding transition ob - served in ﬂuid membrane domains . This can be seen more clearly in a transverse projection of the vesicle shapes , which is shown in Fig . 3 . The average shapes strongly resemble those calculated for phase - separated ﬂuid membranes @ 32 # . B . Defects and budding transition In order to obtain a more detailed picture of the budding process , we have calculated several quantities that character - ize the domain shape and the internal defect structure in the clathrin domain . A typical defect conﬁguration is shown in Fig . 4 . Obviously , the length L of the boundary of the clathrin domain is well suited for characterizing the transition . The boundary length is shown in Fig . 5 as a function of the scaled line tension l N A 1 / 2 / k , for several values of the scaled spon - taneous curvature C 0 A N A 1 / 2 . Our motivation for introducing these scaled variables is that in ﬂuid membranes , all size dependence can be absorbed in these quantities . With in - creasing line tension , the curves show a rapid decrease of L for small l due to the suppression of thermal ﬂuctuations , and then a slow decay as the cap slowly curves more strongly for larger l . Finally , L jumps to a very small value , which indicates the ﬁrst - order nature of the budding transi - tion . This jump is large for small spontaneous curvatures and becomes smaller with increasing C 0 . For C 0 A N A 1 / 2 * 4 . 0 , the cap phase is not stable for our value of k 5 10 k B T . A com - parison of the results for the scaled boundary length shown in Fig . 5 indicates that , for a given scaled spontaneous cur - vature C 0 A N A 1 / 2 , the transition occurs at very similar values of l N A 1 / 2 / k for the system sizes studied . The bending of the initially almost ﬂat crystalline domain is only possible when an excess of ﬁvefold disclinations ap - pear inside the domain . We distinguish between crystalline vertices at the boundary of the domain , which have at least one ﬂuid vertex as a nearest neighbor , and crystalline verti - ces in the interior , which have only other crystalline vertices as nearest neighbors . The excess D 5 , i of ﬁvefold coordinated vertices in the interior , i . e . , the number of all ﬁvefold coor - dinated vertices minus the number of all sevenfold coordi - nated vertices in the interior , is shown in Fig . 6 . This excess is again quite small , D 5 , i & 3 , in the cap phase for small C 0 , FIG . 2 . ~ Color online !

The deviation of D 5 , i from 12 in the latter case is due to a small number of defects in the neck region . The defect struc - ture in this region can be characterized by the excess of ﬁvefold coordinated vertices at the boundary . Figure 7 dem - onstrates that in the cap state , this number is larger for small l than the excess in the interior . For larger l , but before budding , the number of excess ﬁvefold disclinations in the boundary and in the interior is almost the same . Finally , in the budded state , the excess becomes negative , i . e . , the num - ber of sevenfold disclinations now exceeds the number of ﬁvefold disclinations , as should be expected from a region of negative Gaussian curvature . From these results , we can already draw the important conclusion that the ﬁvefold disclinations are generated at the domain boundary , before they are pushed slowly into the interior of the domain by the increasing line tension . Since the density of ﬁvefold disclinations at the boundary is higher in the cap state than in the interior , the boundary must also curve more strongly , while the interior remains ﬂatter . In Fig . 8 , we show the number n 5 ( iso ) of isolated ﬁvefold disclinations , i . e . , of ﬁvefold coordinated vertices , that have only sixfold coordinated nearest neighbors . With n 5 ( iso ) & 1 for small C 0 , this number is quite small in the cap phase and jumps to about n 5 ( iso ) . 6 in the budded phase . Since the Eu - ler theorem requires an excess of 12 ﬁvefold disclinations , we conclude that only half of these disclinations are isolated , while the other half are dressed by neighboring dislocations . Figure 8 indicates that for larger system sizes the number of dressed ﬁvefold disclinations increases . Other quantities that characterize the internal order of the crystalline phase are the total number of defects—deﬁned as the total number of ﬁve - and sevenfold coordinated FIG . 5 .

At the budding transi - tion , the jump in the total number of defects in the interior is quite pronounced . In the cap phase , near the budding transi - tion , the total number of defects minus the number of topo - logical disclinations , S i 2 D 5 , i , increases roughly as the do - main area ~ compare Figs . 9 and 6 ! . On the other hand , in the budded phase , S i 2 D 5 , i increases more rapidly , from about 8 for N A 5 92 to about 20 for N A 5 184 . Figure 10 demonstrates that the total number of defects at the boundary is roughly proportional to the boundary length ~ see Fig . 5 ! . The location of the budding transition can be determined from these simulation data . The dependence of the scaled spontaneous curvature C 0 A N A on the scaled line tension l A N A / k at the budding transition is shown in Fig . 11 . The transition points were determined from the point of intersec - tion of a horizontal line of constant boundary length L * with the interpolated data plotted in Fig . 5 . L * has been chosen to lie approximately halfway between the two values of the domain lengths at the cap - to - bud transition ( L * 5 20 for N A 5 92 , L * 5 30 for N A 5 184 , and L * 5 40 for N A 5 368 ) . For all three system sizes , the data are consistent with l R A / k 1 g C 0 A R A 5 G ~ R A ! ~ 5 ! at the transition , where R A is the radius of the planar , circular clathrin domain , with p R A 2 5 2 N A A 3 ^ , & / 4 to leading order , and average bond length ^ , & . ( 1 1 , A ) / 2 of AA bonds . We have determined R A numerically from the area of the clathrin domain . The resulting values of R A exhibit a weak depen - dence on the spontaneous curvature and the line tension . At the budding transition , R A is found to be about 10 % smaller in the cap phase than in the budded phase . In the following , we have used the latter value . In Eq . ~ 5 ! , the prefactor of the ﬁrst term is normalized to unity . The prefactor g of the second term is found to be close to unity for the two smaller system sizes studied , with g 5 0 . 84 , while the function G ( R A ) has the values G ~ R A ! 5 H 3 . 39 6 0 . 02 for N A 5 92 , R A 5 6 . 18 , 3 . 45 6 0 . 03 for N A 5 184 , R A 5 8 . 74 , 3 . 68 6 0 . 05 for N A 5 368 , R A 5 12 . 4 . ~ 6 !

Dependence on the Young modulus All the data we have presented so far have been calculated for ﬁxed tether length , A 5 1 . 50 . For the system sizes studied in the simulation , this tether length is well in the crystalline phase ; however , in the thermodynamic limit , this tether length is in the center of the hexatic phase . We have there - fore also investigated the behavior for a smaller tether length , , A 5 1 . 45 , which is well within the crystalline phase even in the thermodynamic limit . The comparison of the data for the two tether lengths allows an estimate of the effect of the size of the Young modulus , which characterizes the in - plane elasticity , on the defect distributions and on the phase behavior . Two characteristic quantities , the boundary length L and the number D 5 , i of excess ﬁvefold disclinations in the interior area are shown in Figs . 12 and 13 , respectively . This shows two qualitative effects with decreasing tether length ~ i . e . , in - creasing Young modulus ! : ~ i ! the budding transition is shifted to slightly higher values of the scaled line tension , and ~ ii ! there are fewer excess defects in the cap phase and more excess defects in the budded phase . A more quantitative analysis of the Monte Carlo data will be made in Sec . IV below . IV .

BUDDING OF CRYSTALLINE DOMAINS IN FLUID MEMBRANES PHYSICAL REVIEW E 68 , 061905 ~ 2003 ! 061905 - 7 estimates with our numerical data will lead to a consistent picture of the budding of crystalline domains in vesicles . A . Fluid domains of spherical shape Ju¨licher and Lipowsky @ 32 , 33 # have calculated the locus of budding transitions for axisymmetric vesicles consisting of one ﬂuid domain with spontaneous curvature C 0 A embed - ded in a ﬂuid membrane of spontaneous curvature C 0 B . They solve the shape equations numerically and thereby determine the line of budding transitions . They also derive an analytical estimate for this line by approximating the incomplete bud by a spherical cap and the complete bud by two spheres . For the case of C 0 B 5 0 and k A 5 k B considered here , this estimate is given by l k R 0 5 2 A x ~ 1 2 x ! @ 1 1 C 0 A R 0 ~ x 2 A x ! # , ~ 7 ! where R 0 is the radius of a spherical vesicle of the same area . Equation ~ 7 ! was found to be a lower bound for the transition and to approximate the numerically determined line of bud - ding transitions quite accurately . This estimate can easily be adapted to our case . With R 0 5 R A / ( 2 A x ) , we obtain l k R A 1 1 2 A x A 1 2 x C 0 A R A 5 4 1 A 1 2 x . ~ 8 ! For x N 5 0 . 13 , which corresponds to x 5 0 . 104 for , A 5 1 . 50 , this implies l k R A 1 0 . 716 C 0 A R A 5 4 . 225 . ~ 9 ! Another estimate can be obtained by considering the limit shape of budded vesicles . The limit shape corresponds to an inﬁnitesimal neck , for which Ju¨licher and Lipowsky @ 32 # de - rived the condition l k R A 1 C 0 A R A 5 4 1 4 A x / ~ 1 2 x ! 5 5 . 363 ~ 10 ! for x 5 0 . 104 . This condition must obviously be an upper bound for the location of the budding transition . B . The argument of Mashl and Bruinsma for crystalline domains In order to calculate the location of the budding transition of a crystalline domain , Mashl and Bruinsma @ 16 # considered a membrane domain of radius R A with a ﬁvefold disclination at the center and a sevenfold disclination at distance r . In this scenario , the budding transition is determined by the location of the unbinding of this dislocation pair . They approximate the bending energy of this buckled conﬁguration by E b 5 2 k C 0 A R A L ~ r / R A ! 1 p 2 k ~ C 0 A R A ! 2 , ~ 11 ! where L ~ 0 ! 5 0 and L ( 1 ) 52 p / A 3 . For intermediate values of r / R A , L has to be calculated numerically . The contribu - tion of the stretching energy was estimated to be the energy of a dislocation of Burgers vector r in a buckled crystalline membrane with C 0 [ 0 , E s 5 K 0 r 2 F 1 8 p ln ~ R b / ^ , & ! 1 c ~ k ¯ / k ! G , ~ 12 ! which was calculated in the limit of inﬁnite membrane size by Seung and Nelson @ 34 # . In Eq . ~ 12 ! , R b is the buckling radius of a dislocation , and c ( k ¯ / k ) depends only on the ratio of the bending rigidity k and the saddle - splay modulus k ¯ . Using the sum of Eqs . ~ 11 ! and ~ 12 ! as an ansatz for the free energy , Mashl and Bruinsma @ 16 # found that the minimum of this energy moves continuously from r 5 0 to larger values of r with increasing C 0 , reaching r 5 R A at some value of k C 0 A / ( K 0 R A ) , which signals the budding transition . This re - sults implies , in particular , that C 0 A ; R A at the transition . We believe that this estimate of the free energy of a buck - led disclination pair is incorrect .

KOHYAMA , KROLL , AND GOMPPER PHYSICAL REVIEW E 68 , 061905 ~ 2003 ! 061905 - 8 considering the case r 5 R A . In this case , the sevenfold dis - clination no longer contributes , and we have a cone with a ﬁvefold disclination at the center .

In this case , the stretching energy vanishes , so that Eq . ~ 12 ! strongly over - estimates the stretching contribution . The origin of this dis - agreement is the fact that Eq . ~ 12 ! is valid only in the limit r ! R A @ 34 # . C . Crystalline sphere with disclinations and grain boundaries Bowick , Nelson , and Travesset @ 35 # have recently calcu - lated the energy of an icosahedral lattice on a perfect spheri - cal surface which contains no defects other than the topologi - cally required 12 disclinations . For a sphere of radius R 0 , the elastic energy was found to be E ico 5 C ico p K 0 36 R 02 1 12 E core ~ 14 ! with C ico 5 0 . 604 , where K 0 is the two - dimensional Young modulus . For a vesicle with large bending rigidity , i . e . , with k @ K 0 ^ , & 2 , where ^ , & 5 ( 1 1 , A ) / 2 is the average bond length in the clathrin domain , we can use this result to esti - mate the position of the budding transition by comparing this energy with that of a planar patch of the same area , i . e . , with R A 5 2 R 0 . For the sphere , the energy is a sum of the stretch - ing energy ~ 14 ! and the curvature energy ~ 1 ! . The energies of the planar and budded conﬁgurations are equal when l k R A 1 2 C 0 R A 5 4 1 C ico 288 K 0 R A 2 k 1 12 E core 2 pk . ~ 15 ! In order to see whether the stretching term contributes , we have to insert values for K 0 and R A that are characteristic for our simulation . In Ref . @ 25 # , it was shown that the two - dimensional Young modulus K 0 for planar , crystal - line networks of the type employed in our simulations in - creases with decreasing tether length , 0 . In particular , the values K 0 ^ , & 2 5 64 . 8 for , A 5 1 . 50 and K 0 ^ , & 2 5 78 . 0 for , A 5 1 . 45 were obtained @ 25 # . For R A 5 12 . 5 , the largest domain size considered in the simulations , this implies ( C ico / 288 ) K 0 R A 2 / k . 1 . 36 for , A 5 1 . 50 and ( C ico / 288 ) K 0 R A 2 / k . 1 . 70 for , A 5 1 . 45 . For a crystalline sphere , stretching contributions are therefore subdominant on the right - hand side of Eq . ~ 15 ! for the range of domain sizes investigated . Bowick , Nelson , and Travesset @ 35 # have shown that short grain boundaries at the location of the topological disclina - tions screen the strain ﬁeld and lead to a reduction of the energy of a crystalline lattice on a sphere . For grain bound - aries containing n dislocations per disclination , C ico ( n ) de - creases from 0 . 60 , 0 . 44 , 0 . 37 for n 5 0 , 1 , 2 , respectively , to C ico ( n ) . 0 . 25 for large n @ 35 # . The effect of the stretching contribution in Eq . ~ 15 ! is therefore reduced by grain bound - aries . Indeed , in the conﬁgurations shown in Fig . 15 below , several grain - boundary lines are visible . The data for the total number of defects in the interior of the crystalline do - main shown in Fig . 9 indicate that there is about 0 . 5 dislo - cation per topological ﬁvefold disclination for N A 5 92 , and about 1 . 5 for N A 5 184 . D . Crystalline icosahedron without defects When the two - dimensional Young modulus is sufﬁciently large , bending is more favorable than stretching , and the cur - vature is no longer distributed uniformly over the bud @ 36 # . Instead , the stress becomes localized in ‘‘stretching ridges’’ which connect the 12 ﬁvefold disclinations . The bud then takes the shape of an icosahedron with rounded edges and nearly ﬂat faces . For large system sizes , and no defects be - yond the topologically required ﬁvefold disclinations , the en - ergy of such a shape was shown from elasticity theory and simulations to be @ 36 – 38 # E teth 5 11 5 pk ln S N A 12 D 1 C teth k S K 0 k D 1 / 6 R A 1 / 3 1 12 E core , ~ 16 ! where the ﬁrst term is the contribution of the cone - shaped corners and the second of the ridges . The prefactor C teth can be extracted from simulations of tethered networks @ 37 , 38 # , and has been found to be C teth 5 3 . 63 for icosahedra @ 38 # and C teth 5 9 . 3 for tetrahedra @ 37 # . It is interesting to note that the simulations of Refs . @ 37 , 38 # show that for C 0 5 0 the contribution of the cone - shaped corners dominates up to quite large system sizes . Only for ( K 0 / k ) 1 / 2 R A in the range of 500 to 1500 do the ridges begin to dominate the curvature energy . This can eas - ily be seen from Eq . ~ 16 ! , where the contributions of corners and ridges are equal when S K 0 k D 1 / 2 R A 5 F 11 p 5 C teth ln @ N A / 12 # G 3 . ~ 17 ! We now compare the free energies of a planar disk and a deformed sphere , which we consider to be composed of 12 cones . The membrane area of a cone corresponding to a ﬁve - fold disclination is ( 6 / 5 ) p R 02 . This implies R A 2 5 ( 72 / 5 ) R 02 and l k R A 1 2 A 11 10 C 0 A R A 5 12 E teth 2 pk ~ 18 ! so that G ( R A ) exhibits a logarithmic dependence when the energy contribution of the cone - shaped corners dominates . For large values of ( K 0 / k ) 1 / 2 R A , G ( R A ) is proportional to R A 1 / 3 . BUDDING OF CRYSTALLINE DOMAINS IN FLUID MEMBRANES PHYSICAL REVIEW E 68 , 061905 ~ 2003 ! 061905 - 9 E . Hexatic domains of cone - shape In crystalline membranes that are larger than the buckling radius R b of a dislocation , the elastic ~ curvature and stretch - ing ! energy of a free dislocation has been predicted to ap - proach a constant , independent of system size @ 34 # . This pre - diction has been conﬁrmed by Monte Carlo simulations @ 24 , 25 # of the same network model that is employed in the current study . Therefore , the free energy of dislocations is negative for any ﬁnite temperature for a sufﬁciently large membrane . This implies that a ﬁnite concentration of free dislocations is present in the membrane , which destroys translational order . The resulting phase , which still has bond - orientational order , is called a hexatic . The energy E 5 of a cone - shaped membrane in the hexatic phase was calculated in Refs . @ 39 , 40 # , with the result E 5 p K H 5 H 2 F S 25 36 1 k K H D S 1 2 k K H D G 1 / 2 2 5 3 J ln ~ R 0 / ^ , & ! ~ 19 ! for k / K H , 11 / 72 and E 5 p K H 5 1 36 ln ~ R 0 / ^ , & ! ~ 20 ! for k / K H . 11 / 72 , where K H is the hexatic stiffness and R 0 is the radius of the base area of the cone . The budding transi - tion is again described by Eq . ~ 18 ! , with E teth replaced by E 5 . This result implies that G ( R A ) exhibits a logarithmic dependence for sufﬁciently large R A . In order to proceed , we need an estimate of the magnitude of the ratio k / K H . Such an estimate can be obtained by comparing the calculated phase diagram as a function of k and K H @ 41 # with the phase diagram obtained from Monte Carlo simulations of our model @ 24 , 25 # . Since K H is not known in the simulations , the phase diagram was plotted as a function of the Young modulus K 0 of a membrane with the same tether length , but without any defects . The two phase diagrams have very similar shapes . Therefore , we assume K H 5 a K 0 ^ , & 2 , with a proportionality constant a which is obtained from ﬁtting the location of the hexatic - to - ﬂuid tran - sition , which occurs at k B T / K H 5 p / 72 5 0 . 0436 @ 41 # and at k B T / ( K 0 ^ , & 2 ) 5 0 . 0172 @ 21 # . This implies a 5 0 . 4 . From the simulation results for K 0 ^ , & 2 @ 25 # , we then ﬁnd K H 5 25 . 8 for , A 5 1 . 50 and K H 5 31 . 2 for , A 5 1 . 45 . Thus , for k 5 10 , we obtain k / K H . 0 . 39 . 11 / 72 and k / K H . 0 . 32 . 11 / 72 for , A 5 1 . 50 and , A 5 1 . 45 , respectively . Therefore , for our range of simulated tether lengths , 12 E 5 / ( 2 pk ) 5 @ K H / ( 6 k ) # ln ( R 0 / ^ , & ) . This yields a logarithmic depen - dence with a prefactor of K H / ( 6 k ) . 0 . 5 . It is interesting to note that renormalization group calcu - lations for ﬂuctuating planar membranes predict that the ratio K H / k approaches the universal value K H / k 5 4 in the long - wavelength limit in the hexatic , ‘‘crinkled’’ phase @ 41 , 42 # . Our estimate of K H / k . 3 in the short - wavelength regime indicates that corrections to scaling can be expected to be small . V . DISCUSSION OF BUDDING SCENARIOS From the various theoretical results described in the pre - vious subsections , together with the simulation data , the fol - lowing picture emerges . The budding behavior depends on the value of the ratio Q 5 K 0 R A 2 / k , on the buckling radius R b / ^ , & ; k / ( K 0 ^ , & 2 ) of a dislocation , measured in units of the average nearest - neighbor distance , and on the distance from the two - dimensional melting transition , which is deter - mined by the value of K 0 ^ , & 2 . There are various scenarios , depending on the values of the buckling radius and K 0 ^ , & 2 . Two possible scenarios are sketched in Fig . 14 . Consider ﬁrst the case of large buckling radius and very low defect density , @ See Fig . 14 ~ a ! # . Then , for small domain sizes R A , Q is small , the bud is spherical , and the membrane is crystalline without excess defects . This is the case discussed in Sec . IV C . With increasing size , defect scars in the form of short grain boundaries appear at the location of the 12 ﬁve - fold disclinations . The spherical shape begins to deform into FIG . 14 . Scaling regimes for the function G , which characterizes the dependence of the budding transition on the radius R A ~ in units of the average bond length ^ , & ! of a planar crystalline domain . ~ a ! Low defect density and high Young modulus . ~ b ! High defect den - sity and low Young modulus . ‘‘Spherical’’ denotes the regime of spherical bud shapes , ‘‘cones’’ the regime where the ﬁvefold dislo - cations are cone shaped , ‘‘stretching ridges’’ the regime where the competition of bending and stretching leads to stress condensation along the edges of an icosahedron , and ‘‘hexatic’’ the regime where free dislocations induce hexatic order in the membrane . In the spherical regime , short grain boundaries reduce the stretching energy .

Finally , the system size becomes so large that the free energy of a free buckled dislocation , F disloc 5 1 8 p K 0 ^ , & 2 ln ~ R b / ^ , & ! 2 k B T ln ~ p R A 2 / ^ , & 2 ! , ~ 21 ! becomes negative and the membrane enters the hexatic phase discussed in Sec . IV E . This happens when p ~ R A / ^ , & ! 2 5 ~ R b / ^ , & ! ( 1 / 8 p ) ( K 0 ^ , & 2 / k B T ) , ~ 22 ! where the exponent on the right - hand side is close to 2 in the vicinity of the crystal - to - hexatic transition for the planar sys - tem , but becomes very large at small tether lengths . The crossover from the regime of a spherical crystal with defect scars to the regime of a rounded icosahedron without defects can be estimated by equating the energies of Eqs . ~ 14 ! and ~ 16 ! . This corresponds to Q 5 1584 5 C ico ln S N A 12 D , ~ 23 ! where we have assumed that the system is small enough that for the icosahedron the energy is dominated by the contribu - tion from the corners . For crystalline domains with smaller values of Q , the shape should be spherical with defect scars ; for domains with larger Q rounded icosahedrons should be observed . For N 5 500 , this implies Q 5 2410 . At the cross - over point , the contribution of the stretching energy in Eq . ~ 15 ! roughly equals the contribution of the bending energy . The crossover from the crystalline to the hexatic phase is determined by the ratio R A / R b of the buckling radius R b and the domain size . For open membranes with free boundary conditions , the buckling radius has been calculated in Ref . @ 34 # to be R b 5 J ( k ¯ / k ) k / ( K 0 ^ , & ) . The scaling function J ( k ¯ / k ) depends on the ratio of the saddle - splay modulus k ¯ and the bending rigidity k . The Gaussian - curvature term in the curvature Hamiltonian has to be taken into account for open membranes , since it determines the boundary con - ditions . For k ¯ / k 5 0 , where the curvature Hamiltonian be - comes unstable with respect to the formation of saddle - shaped structures with small radii of curvature , the buckling radius vanishes . Similarly , the buckling radius vanishes for k ¯ / k 52 2 , where the curvature Hamiltonian has an instabil - ity toward the formation of small vesicles . In the range 2 2 , k ¯ / k , ﬂuid membranes with large radii of curvature are stable , and the buckling radius is ﬁnite , with a maximum at k ¯ / k . 2 0 . 8 where J . 125 . For vesicles or membranes with periodic boundary condi - tions which are characterized by a uniform saddle - splay modulus , the Gauss - Bonnet theorem indicates that the inte - gral over the Gaussian curvature is a topological invariant which does not affect the membrane shape and ﬂuctuations . Therefore , the buckling radius cannot depend on k ¯ in this case . However , periodic boundary conditions or the spherical topology of a vesicle can be expected to have a similar con - straining effect on buckling as the most unfavorable value of k ¯ for open boundaries . We therefore propose that , for vesicles , the value of the buckling radius for open mem - branes with k ¯ 52 k should be used . For , 0 5 1 . 50 and k 5 10 , this implies R b 5 25 . Consider now a system with a small buckling radius and a high defect density @ see Fig . 14 ~ b ! # . In this case , for small domain sizes , we again expect spherical shapes with short grain boundaries . However , for larger sizes there should be a direct crossover to hexatic membranes . The main conclusion that can be drawn from the preced - ing analysis is that , in general , we predict a weak size depen - dence of G ( R A ) in Eq . ~ 5 ! , with several distinct scaling re - gimes @ 43 # . In particular , the value of the line tension or the spontaneous curvature at the budding transition is a decreas - ing function of R A . This result is strongly supported by our simulation data . In our simulations , Q 5 415 for , A 5 1 . 50 and R A 5 10 . The parameters in the simulations are therefore such that we are in the crossover regime from the crystalline to the hexatic phase : defect scars can be recognized , the buckling radius is on the order of the domain size , the stretching energy is comparable to the bending energy , and small deviations from the spherical shape are visible . We can make the comparison of the Monte Carlo data and the analytical estimates more quantitative by studying the dependence of the budding transition on the domain size . First , for the Monte Carlo data , the prefactor g of the spon - taneous curvature term in Eq . ~ 5 ! is found to be g 5 0 . 84 , slightly smaller than , but close to unity , in good agreement with the predictions for ﬂuid vesicles @ compare Eqs . ~ 9 ! and ~ 10 ! # . On the other hand , the prefactor of the spontaneous curvature term in all our estimates for crystalline and hexatic membranes was found to be g 5 2 . However , this can easily be traced back to the fact that in the latter cases we do not take into account that the cap has a curved shape . Rather , we simply compare the free energies of ﬂat domains and spheri - cal buds . The same approximation would also lead to g 5 2 for ﬂuid domains . We therefore believe that our analytical results for crystalline and hexatic domains overestimate this prefactor . Second , we have seen in Figs . 5 – 10 that the budding tran - sition disappears for C 0 s 0 N A 1 / 2 . 4 , which corresponds to C 0 R A . 2 . 6 . This result can easily be understood on the basis of Eq . ~ 5 ! . For this value of C 0 R A , the two sides of Eq . ~ 5 ! become equal for a line tension ls 0 on the order of k B T . The line tension is so small in this case that we are very close to the mixing critical point of the two components . Third , we can compare the dependence of G ( R A ) ob - tained from the Monte Carlo data with the prediction ~ 15 ! for crystalline buds with grain boundaries . The numerical data for , A 5 1 . 50 are well described by G ( R A ) 5 3 . 28 1 0 . 0004 K 0 R A 2 / k . The numerical prefactor of the second term should be compared with C ico ( n ) / 288 , which is 0 . 001 for n 5 2 . Since we have additional dislocations in the simu - lated domains due to the vicinity of the hexatic phase , these two results are in very nice agreement . An important point we have not discussed yet is the de - pendence of G ( R A ) on the two - dimensional Young modulus K 0 . In the defect - free crystalline phase , Eq . ~ 14 ! implies a BUDDING OF CRYSTALLINE DOMAINS IN FLUID MEMBRANES PHYSICAL REVIEW E 68 , 061905 ~ 2003 ! 061905 - 11 linear dependence on K 0 . With the numbers appropriate for our simulations , a change of the tether length from , A 5 1 . 50 to , A 5 1 . 45 implies a shift DG ( R A ) 5 0 . 21 . This re - sult is consistent with the small shift observed in the simu - lations , ~ see Figs . 12 and 13 ! . It is worth mentioning that we would obtain a quadratic R A contribution to G in the regime of crystalline buds which is reminiscent of the result of Mashl and Bruinsma @ 16 # if the contribution of the stretching energy in Eq . ~ 15 ! were larger than that of the bending energy . However , it is important to note that ~ i ! the physical origin of this contribution is differ - ent , since in our case , it arises from the stretching of a crys - talline cone when it is deformed into a spherical cap , while it comes from the energy of a disclination pair in theirs , and ~ ii ! the stretching contribution , which is proportional to K 0 R A 2 , can never dominate the bending energy , since the bud begins to deform into an icosahedral shape before this can happen . VI . DYNAMICS OF THE BUDDING TRANSITION A . Formation of single buds In Sec . III we studied the shapes , defect distributions , and phase behavior of two - component vesicles in thermal equi - librium . Another interesting question is the dynamical behav - ior after the system has been quenched from a state of van - ishing spontaneous curvature , C 0 A 5 0 , to a part of the phase diagram where single buds are stable . Here , the question arises as to how the defects appear dynamically in the clath - rin domain . Several snapshots of conﬁgurations during the budding process are shown in Fig . 15 for a system with C 0 A 5 0 . 2 after the quench . The ﬁgure demonstrates very nicely that ﬁve - fold and sevenfold disclinations are generated at the domain boundary , and that the ﬁvefold disclinations then move into the internal area of the clathrin patch . The time dependence of the boundary length and the ex - cess number of ﬁvefold disclinations in the interior of the clathrin domain are shown in Fig . 16 and Fig . 17 , respec - tively . From these ﬁgures , the following time regimes can be distinguished . ~ i ! Fivefold disclinations appear on the boundary and move into the internal area . ~ ii ! The number of excess ﬁvefold disclinations in the internal area is almost constant , but the shape gradually FIG . 15 . ~ Color online !

Microcages We can also consider the case of a quench to a state of large spontaneous curvature C 0 A R A @ 1 , and very small line tension . The budding process now proceeds very differently , in particular for a large Young modulus ~ smaller tether length ! . This can be seen in the sequence of snapshots given in Fig . 18 , where small buds are forming near the domain boundary , while the central region of the domain remains essentially ﬂat . The shape of the clathrin domain now evolves as follows . ~ i ! At the beginning , the interior part of the domain re - mains ﬂat , since no defects are present . The mobility of de - fects is low for large Young modulus . Therefore , only the boundary region can curve , which it does . The domain shape becomes a ﬂattened mushroom . ~ ii ! A wavelike instability occurs at the boundary , which leads to the formation of many small , spherical buds . This is possible because the line tension is very small . This state strongly resembles the microcages seen in clathrin domains after a strong quench in p H ~ see Fig . 19 ! . ~ iii ! The state of small buds is not stable , but evolves into a cylindrical shape with time .

BUDDING OF CLATHRIN - COATED MEMBRANES The biochemistry of the budding process in clathrin - coated vesicles has been studied in considerable detail in recent years @ 44 – 46 # . In addition to clathrin , many other proteins have been found to play an important role in clathrin - mediated endocytosis . In synaptic vesicle endocyto - sis , coat proteins AP2 and AP180 are recruited to the mem - brane to bind the clathrin proteins to the membrane @ 47 # . The invagination of the coated membrane depends on endophilin @ 48 # . Narrowing of the neck region may involve several fac - tors , including actin , intersectin , dynamin , and amphiphysin @ 49 # . Finally , ﬁssion depends on dynamin , probably in coop - eration with other proteins such as amphiphysin and endo - philin @ 48 # . For the comparison of our results with the formation of clathrin - coated vesicles , it is interesting to determine pos - sible mechanisms for the generation of spontaneous curva - ture . Here , endophilin I seems to play an essential role . It has been shown , for example , that in the absence of endophilin I , the clathrin - coated pit does not transform into a complete bud @ 48 # . It therefore seems natural to assume that endophi - lin induces a spontaneous curvature in the clathrin domain . This view is supported by the fact that after presynaptic mi - FIG . 18 . ~ Color online !

BUDDING OF CRYSTALLINE DOMAINS IN FLUID MEMBRANES PHYSICAL REVIEW E 68 , 061905 ~ 2003 ! 061905 - 13 croinjection of antiendophilin antibodies , the invagination process appears to be inhibited in a concentration - dependent manner , as the depth of the coated pits decreases with in - creasing antibody concentration @ 48 # . Furthermore , endophi - lin I has been found to convert lysophosphatic acid , an inverted - cone - shaped lipid , to phosphatic acid , a cone - shaped lipid in the cytoplasmic leaﬂet of the bilayer @ 50 # . In the interior of the clathrin domain , such a conversion would imply a spontaneous curvature toward the clathrin side , i . e . , a negative rather than the desired positive spontaneous curva - ture . However , the latter activity may occur only in the neck region due to the interaction with dynamin , which forms a ring around the neck . It has been proposed that this induces a negative membrane curvature at the edges of a coated pit , which promotes membrane ﬁssion @ 50 # . It has also been shown that clathrin - coated buds morpho - logically similar to the corresponding structures observed in synaptic vesicles can be generated on protein - free liposomes by incubation with cytosol @ 51 # , which suggests that the pri - mary function of membrane proteins is to act as regulators of coat assembly . Furthermore , Heuser @ 14 # has shown that both the in vivo acidiﬁcation of cells as well the in vitro acidiﬁcation of exposed clathrin lattices leads to the forma - tion of budded microcages which nucleate at the edges of the clathrin network ~ see Fig . 19 ! . The resulting structures are very similar to those shown in Fig . 18 which develop after a quench from an initially ﬂat state for large spontane - ous curvature . The microcages observed by Heuser @ 14 # are spherical in shape , with radii on the order of 25 – 30 nm , and are small compared to normal coated clathrin pits ~ compare Fig . 1 ! . VIII . SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Heuser @ 14 # suggested that the driving force for the for - mation of clathrin - coated vesicles is the chemical asymmetry of the clathrin network . This asymmetry induces a ﬁnite mean curvature in the membrane which depends on the p H and other environmental conditions . Budding occurs when the curvature becomes sufﬁciently large . In the model con - sidered in this paper , this asymmetry is described by the spontaneous curvature . We have shown that for a large range of material parameters , budding in crystalline networks of radius R A occurs at a critical value of the spontaneous cur - vature that is a monotonically decreasing function of R A . It was also shown that the disclinations required to form the budded state are created at the boundary of the crystalline patch . Budding occurs when a sufﬁcient number of the re - quired ﬁvefold disclinations have been formed and have dif - fused into the domain interior . For the model parameters we considered , the energies associated with changes in the local structure of the network are of the order of k B T . This scenario is quite different from that suggested by Mashl and Bruinsma @ 16 # . In particular , the dynamical be - havior we observe is not consistent with their type of interior - acquisition model . While Mashl and Bruinsma pre - dict that the formation of ﬁvefold disclinations proceeds via the unbinding of dislocations in the interior region of the network , we have found , as summarized in the last para - graph , that disclinations are formed at the domain boundary before diffusing into the interior . Furthermore , Mashl and Bruinsma @ 16 # argue that the ~ 20 – 30 ! k B T of energy required for the dissociation of clath - rin coats provides an estimate for the energy needed to break the bond between the four clathrin arms in a polygonal edge . This would imply that diffusive motion of ﬁvefold and sev - enfold disclinations induced by thermal ﬂuctuations is rather unlikely . It is still an open question if this is indeed the case . A recent analysis of the size distribution of reconstituted clathrin cages suggests that the relevant energy scale for changes in the local structure of clathrin coats is on the order of k B T @ 52 # . Our present Monte Carlo simulations cover the range of small bond energies , while our scaling results should be applicable also for large bond energies . The detailed behavior at the budding transition depends on the value of the ratio Q [ K 0 R A 2 / k , the buckling radius of a dislocation , and the distance from the two - dimensional melting transition . The various scenarios are discussed in Sec . IV and summarized in Fig . 14 . For the current simula - tions , Q ’ 400 , so that the transition occurs in the crossover region from the crystalline to the hexatic phase . In this case , the buckling radius is on the order of the domain size , the stretching energy is comparable to the bending energy , and short grain boundaries can be seen at the topologically re - quired ﬁvefold disclinations . It remains a formidable challenge to elucidate the various mechanisms involved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis in living cells . For this reason , it would be extremely interesting to perform further studies on the endocytosis of protein - free liposomes in order to determine the extent to which simple models of the type discussed in this paper can describe the generic features of formation of clathrin - coated pits . Experi - ments on simple , well characterized systems could be used in conjunction with simulations , as was done in Ref . @ 19 # for giant synthetic lipid bilayer vesicles , to quantify our under - standing of the underlying physical mechanism of the bud - ding of coated pits .
