Cell lines derived from patients or mice with CLN3 deficiency have impairments in actin - regulated processes such as endocytosis , autophagy , vesicular trafficking , and cell migration . Here we demonstrate the small GTPase Cdc42 is misregulated in the absence of CLN3 , and thus may be a common link to multiple cellular defects . We discover that active Cdc42 ( Cdc42 - GTP ) is elevated in endothelial cells from CLN3 deficient mouse brain , and correlates with enhanced PAK - 1 phosphorylation , LIMK membrane recruitment , and altered actin - driven events . We also demonstrate dramatically reduced plasma membrane recruitment of the Cdc42 GTPase activating protein , ARHGAP21 . In line with this , GTP - loaded ARF1 , an effector of ARHGAP21 recruitment , is depressed . Together these data implicate misregulated ARF1 - Cdc42 signaling as a central defect in JNCL cells , which in - turn impairs various cell functions . Furthermore our findings support concerted action of ARF1 , ARHGAP21 , and Cdc42 to regulate fluid phase endocytosis in mammalian cells . The ARF1 - Cdc42 pathway presents a promising new avenue for JNCL therapeutic development .

JNCL patients develop visual symptoms at 4 – 7 years of age , leading rapidly to blindness . This is followed by progressive seizures , physical and mental decline , and most affected individ - uals succumb to disease by the second or third decade of life [ 2 , 3 ] . By magnetic resonance imaging , JNCL patients have progressive volume loss in most brain regions [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] . While intracellular accumulation of autofluorescent material is well documented and the natural history described , the mechanisms by which CLN3 deficiency induces pathogenesis in JNCL is not understood . Earlier work showed that autoantibodies against central nervous system proteins were present in JNCL mouse models and patient blood [ 7 , 8 , 9 ] . This could reflect blood brain barrier ( BBB ) compromise . In a knock - in mouse model for CLN3 , wherein the bacterial b - galactosidase reporter was inserted into the endogenous CLN3 locus , reporter expression was robust in brain endothelial cells [ 10 ] . In addition , patient endothelial cells are laden with the characteristic storage inclusions [ 11 , 12 ] . This suggests that CLN3 is important for brain endothelial cell function and integrity . Using the CLN3 null reporter mouse we have shown multiple defects in intracellular membrane dynamics and protein trafficking both in vivo and in vitro [ 13 ] , although the molecular basis for the impact of CLN3 on these processes is not known . CLN3 is a 438 amino acid protein with six predicted transmembrane domains [ 14 ] . Notably , a lack of sensitive antibodies precludes reliable detection of endogenous CLN3 in situ . In vitro analyses using overexpression systems has localized CLN3 to the Golgi , plasma membrane , synaptosomes , late endosomes , and lysosomes [ 3 , 14 ] . CLN3 deficiency is reported to cause defects in cell motility [ 15 ] , Golgi antero - and retrograde trafficking , lysosomal pH , autophagy , lipid metabolism or trans - port , and endocytosis [ 3 , 13 ] . Impaired endocytosis is a consistent observation in CLN3 - deficient cells including yeast , mouse neurons and endothelial cells , and patient fibroblasts [ 13 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 ] . Here , we find that fluid phase endocytosis is also impaired in brain microvascular endothelial cells . Fluid - phase endocytosis relies heavily on the actin cytoskeleton network , and multiple groups have found alterations in the actin cytoskeleton or actin binding proteins [ 15 , 16 ] . However , how the absence of CLN3 impairs this network remains unknown . The small GTPase Cdc42 regulates sequential synthesis and break down of actin allowing fluid - phase uptake to occur [ 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 ] . To accomplish this Cdc42 cycles from an active GTP - bound to an inactive GDP - bound state [ 25 ] . In the GTP - bound state Cdc42 binds to and subsequently activates target proteins , initiating scaffolding - protein recruitment and signal induction , ultimately triggering actin polymerization . Actin filament formation facilitates inward budding , scission , and the early vesicle transport events of endocytosis . Actin disassembly is PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 May 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 5 | e96647 Competing Interests : The authors have declared that no competing interests exist . necessary for continuous rounds of endocytosis , and dynamic Cdc42 cycling is critical for orchestrating polymerization / depoly - merization events . Notably , if Cdc42 is constrained in either the GTP or GDP loaded state , fluid - phase uptake is inhibited [ 26 , 27 ] . Based on the requirement for Cdc42 cycling , CLN3 deficiency could impair fluid phase endocytosis by either enhancing or reducing Cdc42 pathway activation as shown in Fig . 1 . Regulation of Cdc42 cycling is executed by GTPase activating proteins ( GAPs ) , which increase GTP hydrolysis , and guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) which facilitate removal of the tightly bound GDP , allowing GTP reloading ( Fig . 1 ) [ 25 ] . Recruitment of the GAP , ARHGAP21 ( also known as ARH - GAP10 ) , to the plasma membrane is essential for modulating the plasma membrane activity of Cdc42 [ 27 ] ; ARHGAP21 knock - down induces increased Cdc42 membrane localization , filopodia formation , actin filament disorganization , and inhibition of fluid - phase endocytosis [ 27 ] . By co - immunoprecipitation [ 28 ] and crystallography studies [ 29 ] ARHGAP21 interacts with and is regulated by GTP - loaded ARF1 , another small GTPase . We hypothesized that misregulation of Cdc42 underlies endocytic and other actin - based defects in CLN3 deficient cells . To test this , we assessed Cdc42 activity and examined factors that function upstream and downstream of Cdc42 ( Fig . 1 ) . Herein we show that GTP - loaded Cdc42 is elevated in CLN3 null MBEC , with reduced GTP - loaded ARF1 and impaired plasma recruitment of ARHGAP21 . Results Altered fluid - phase endocytosis and increased Cdc42 - GTP in CLN3 - deficient MBECs Decreased levels of fluid - phase endocytosis are widely reported in CLN3 mutant cells [ 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 ] , but the underlying molecular mechanism has not been investigated , nor has this Figure 1 . The role of Cdc42 GTP to GDP cycling in fluid phase endocytosis . Fluid - phase endocytosis requires Cdc42 cycling from the GTP to the GDP bound state , which is controlled in part by GAPs and GEFs , and upstream of that , ARF1 . Defects in Cdc42 cycling negatively influence endocytosis . In the absence of CLN3 , faulty recruitment or function of a regulator ( for example ARF1 , GAP or GEF ) can create an imbalance toward either Cdc42 - GDP ( left ) or Cdc42 - GTP ( right ) , which would in turn impair endocytosis . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0096647 . g001 Figure 2 .

To address this we used primary cultures of MBECs from wildtype ( WT ) and our CLN3 - null ( Cln3 lacZ / lacZ ) mice and measured fluid - phase endocy - tosis by incubating them with fluorescently - labeled dextran . Primary Cln3 2 / 2 cells display poor fluid - phase uptake , with quantification indicating 84 % decrease relative to WT cells ( Fig . 2A ) . Immortalized MBECs generated from Cln3 2 / 2 mice similarly display poor dextran uptake , and stable re - introduction of Cln3 ( Cln3 R ) restores fluid - phase endocytosis ( Fig . 2B ) . Unlike clathrin or caveolar endocytosis , fluid - phase endocytosis does not utilize coat proteins to induce vesicle formation , but instead relies on actin - dependent events controlled by the small GTPase , Cdc42 [ 21 ] . We assessed whether endogenous levels of GTP - loaded Cdc42 were affected by CLN3 loss . Interestingly , quantification revealed elevated Cdc42 - GTP in primary Cln3 2 / 2 MBECs compared to WT ( Fig . 3A ) . Increased Cdc42 - GTP was also observed , but not as pronounced , in immortalized Cln3 2 / 2 relative to Cln3 R MBECs ( Fig . 3A ) . To determine whether elevated Cdc42 - GFP is a consequence of an overall increase in Cdc42 protein levels , we quantified total Cdc42 levels by western blot . These data revealed no differences in protein expression between Cln3 R and Cln3 2 / 2 MBECs ( Fig . 3B ) . Thus , increased Cdc42 - GTP , in the setting of CLN3 deficiency , represents impaired GTP - to - GDP cycling , which in - turn could explain the endocytosis block . Based on the extent of Cdc42 - GFP elevation , one might expect a greater disparity between the primary and immortalized cells with respect to the endocytic defect . We speculate that immortalization likely alters various pathways that involve Cdc42 , but that the pool of Cdc42 devoted to regulating endocytosis may be similar between primary and immortalized cells . Nevertheless , our data support defective Cdc42 cycling proximal to impaired fluid phase endocytosis in both primary and immortalized CLN3 - null MBEC . To confirm that Cdc42 cycling is required for efficient fluid - phase uptake in brain endothelia , MBECs were transfected with wildtype ( WT ) , dominant negative ( DN ) , or constitutively active ( CA ) Cdc42 expressing plasmids and fluid - phase uptake was quantified . We found that overexpression of either CA or DN forms significantly reduced dextran uptake compared to transfec - tion with WT Cdc42 ( Fig . 3C ) . This is consistent with studies from other groups [ 26 , 27 ] , and illustrates the influence of Cdc42 dynamics on this pathway in MBECs . CLN3 loss correlates with increased P - PAK - 1 and LIMK membrane recruitment Cdc42 - GTP induces a well - established signaling cascade that recruits proteins to membranes . Cdc42 - GTP activates p21 protein activated kinase 1 ( PAK - 1 ) , resulting in PAK - 1 phosphorylation ( P - PAK - 1 ) and LIM kinase domain 1 ( LIMK ) activation initiating actin polymerization . To investigate downstream components of Cdc42 activation , namely levels of P - PAK - 1 , Cln3 R and Cln3 2 / 2 lysates were assessed for P - PAK - 1 levels by western blot . Although total amounts of PAK - 1 protein were the same in Cln3 R and Cln3 2 / 2 MBECs , Cln3 2 / 2 cells have increased levels of P - PAK - 1 ( Fig . 4A ) , consistent with amplified Cdc42 - GTP activity . To quantify LIMK1 recruitment to membranes , total lysates and membrane - enriched lysates were analyzed for LIMK1 by western blot . Similar to P - PAK - 1 , total LIMK1 levels were equivalent in Cln3 2 / 2 and Cln3 R preparations , but there was increased LIMK recruitment in Cln3 2 / 2 membranes relative to Cln3 R controls ( Fig . 4B ) . These findings show that in the absence of Figure 3 . Cdc42 - GTP is elevated in CLN3 - null MBECs .

Filopodia formation and cell migration are abnormal in Cln3 2 / 2 cells Due to the importance of Cdc42 in actin polymerization , we next analyzed actin distribution and morphology in Cln3 R and Cln3 2 / 2 MBECs using confocal microscopy . There was altered actin staining , and we noted increased filopodial formation in Cln3 2 / 2 MBECs ( Fig . S1 ) . We quantified filopodia number per length of plasma membrane by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) and discovered that Cln3 2 / 2 cells have 4 - fold more filopodia compared to Cln3 R cells ( Fig . 5A ) . Moreover , the average filopodia length was increased by 50 % for Cln3 2 / 2 relative to Cln3 R cells ( Fig . 5A ) . In addition to its role in filopodial formation , Cdc42 is involved in establishing cell polarity , and Cdc42 cycling is necessary for polarized cell movement . Live cell microscopy of Cln3 2 / 2 and Cln3 R MBECs showed that Cln3 2 / 2 MBECs are delayed in their ability to migrate into a gap in the monolayer , indicative of impaired polarized cell motility ( Fig . 5B ) . Cell polarity defects have been described in btn1 2 / 2 yeast ( CLN3 ortholog ) [ 16 ] , and polarized cell migration was previously shown to be impaired in JNCL patient fibroblasts [ 15 ] . Abnormalities in endocytosis , filopodia formation and polarized migration are in accordance with the observed Cdc42 cycling defect . CLN3 null cells have reduced plasma membrane localized ARHGAP21 For fluid - phase endocytosis , ARHGAP21 is recruited to the plasma membrane where it promotes the GTPase activity of Cdc42 [ 27 ] ( Fig . 1 ) . Given our finding of enhanced Cdc42 - GTP , we wondered whether ARHGAP21 abundance or membrane recruitment is impaired in Cln3 2 / 2 MBECs . Using confocal microscopy , we observed a reduction in ARHGAP21 signal intensity in Cln3 2 / 2 MBECs ( Fig . 6A ) relative to normal cells . To test for changes in plasma membrane localization , total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIRFM ) was used , which showed that Cln3 2 / 2 MBECs have significantly reduced levels of plasma membrane localized ARHGAP21 ( Fig . 6B ) . Western blot analysis showed equivalent ARHGAP21 protein levels in Cln3 R and Cln3 2 / 2 MBECs ( Fig . 6C ) , indicating that reduced ARH - GAP21 TIRFM signal reflects a defect in membrane recruitment . Impaired recruitment of ARHGAP21 may thus underlie the amplified Cdc42 - GTP and consequent reduction of fluid - phase endocytosis in the Cln3 2 / 2 MBECs . Overexpression of truncated ARHGAP21 reduces Cdc42 - GTP and inhibits endocytosis Initially we reasoned that transfection to enhance ARHGAP21 expression in CLN3 - null MBECs might normalize Cdc42 activity and restore fluid phase endocytosis . However , while ARHGAP21 overexpression reduced Cdc42 - GTP levels , ( Fig . 7A ) , dextran uptake was not restored in CLN3 - null cells ( Fig . 7B & Fig . S2 ) . These results indicate that ARHGAP21 overload creates an imbalance in favor of the inactive GDP bound state , with a resultant inhibitory effect ( Fig . 1 , left panel ) . Similarly , DN - Cdc42 expression reduced Cdc42 - GTP levels in Cln3 2 / 2 MBECs ( Fig . 7A ) , while in contrast , WT - Cdc42 was without effect . Thus both DN - Cdc42 and ARHGAP21 potently limit Cdc42 - GTP , to the point of inhibiting endocytosis , emphasizing that a fine balance of positive and negative modulation is required to regulate Cdc42 Figure 4 . PAK - 1 phosphorylation and LIMK recruitment are elevated in CLN3 - null MBECs . ( A ) Total cell lysates or ( B ) membrane fractions were analyzed by western blot for PAK - 1 , P - PAK - 1 , and LIMK . Actin and b - catenin were used as total lysate loading controls , and transferrin receptor ( TFNR ) as the loading control for membrane enriched samples . Normalized band intensity was calculated as in Fig . 3 . Results are the mean of three independent experiments . Error bars represent 6 s . e . m .

Cln3 2 / 2 MBECs have reduced ARF1 - GTP ARF1 - GTP promotes ARHGAP21 membrane recruitment and alterations in the GTP loaded state of ARF1 can inhibit fluid - phase endocytosis ( Fig . S3 ) [ 27 ] . Therefore , we next tested whether endogenous ARF1 activity was altered in the absence of CLN3 . Interestingly we found that Cln3 2 / 2 MBECs have lower ARF1 - GTP compared to Cln3 R MBECs ( Fig . 8A ) . This finding provides an explanation for the reduced ARHGAP21 plasma membrane recruitment . These differences are not due to changes in ARF1 protein levels as evidenced by western blotting ( Fig . 8B ) . Together our findings implicate compromised ARF1 activation as a proximal event of CLN3 deficiency , upstream of ARHGAP1 recruitment and endocytic defects . Figure 5 .

Additionally , we show that ARHGAP21 , a known regulator of Cdc42 - mediated fluid - phase endocytosis , is mislocalized . We also demonstrate reduced levels of ARF1 - GTP , a positive regulator of ARHGAP21 membrane recruitment . These data support a model where enhanced Cdc42 pathway activation is due to the loss of ARF1 activation ( Fig . 1 , right panel ) in the setting of CLN3 deficiency . Cell lines derived from patients or mice with CLN3 deficiency have impaired autophagy , vesicular trafficking , clathrin - indepen - dent endocytosis [ 13 ] , and cell migration [ 15 ] , all of which require actin - regulated steps . Consistent with these phenotypes , CLN3 has been reported to associate directly or indirectly with the actin regulatory proteins myosin - IIb , fodrin , and hook1 [ 15 , 19 , 30 ] . Our data implicate the small GTPase Cdc42 as a common link . In addition to Cdc42 , other Rho GTPase family members can regulate actin - dependent processes , and may act coordinately to regulate cytoskeletal changes that affect cell shape and migration [ 31 ] . While it is clear from our study that CLN3 null cells display ARF1 - Cdc42 pathway defects consistent with endocytic , filopodia and cell migration defects , it remains to be determined whether CLN3 loss also impacts the activity of Rho GTPases , further contributing to actin - related phenotypes . Here we used P - PAK1 and LIMK membrane as indicators of Cdc42 activity , but these proteins are also regulated by other Rho GTPases [ 32 , 33 ] . Structures such a filopodia can be the product of Cdc42 and Rac1 regulation [ 31 ] as these GTPases cross activate one another [ 34 ] . Future investigation will address whether activation of other Rho GTPases is aberrant . Figure 7 . The impact of ARHGAP21 overexpression on endocytosis . ( A ) Cln3 2 / 2 and Cln3 R MBECs were transfected with GFP , WT - Cdc42 , dominant negative Cdc42 ( DN - Cdc42 ) , or ARHGAP21 expressing plasmids and Cdc42 - GTP levels measured .

In addition to their role as environmental sensors , filopodia are the foundation for many integrin - matrix connections [ 35 ] . Interestingly , in vivo , endothelial cells with more filopodia have impaired tight junctions [ 36 ] . It is possible that the filopodia phenotype contributes to BBB destabilization . Interestingly , modulation of both PAK1 and LIMK are important regulators of BBB permeability and when dysfunctional can contribute to neurodegeneration [ 37 , 38 ] . Under quiescent conditions in vivo , fluid - phase endocytic activity in brain endothelial cells is low [ 39 ] . During stress , fluid - phase endocytosis is upregulated [ 40 ] , modifying the plasma membrane composition and BBB permeability [ 41 ] . As Cdc42 is important for adhesion and fluid - phase endocytosis , Cln3 2 / 2 mice and JNCL patients may display BBB dysregulation when stressed , such as during an infection or as neurons succumb to disease . Interestingly , ARF1 binding to ARHGAP21 negatively regu - lates Cdc42 activity at both the plasma membrane [ 27 ] and Golgi [ 42 , 43 ] . Cdc42 activity at the Golgi may also be impaired . Indeed , we find a dispersed ARHGAP21 staining pattern in CLN3 - null MBECs that is similar to the ARHGAP21 pattern seen during overexpression of a dominant negative ARF1 [ 28 ] . Previous observations of a fractionated Golgi morphology [ 44 , 45 ] and impaired anterograde [ 46 ] and retrograde [ 47 ] transport at the Golgi in CLN3 null cells , are consistent with defects in ARF1 . In a separate study , we found that CLN3 - null MBECs display impaired anterograde trafficking of caveolin - 1 to the plasma membrane , with consequent reduction in caveolae formation [ 13 ] . Interest - ingly , in addition to its role in fluid - phase endocytosis [ 27 ] , ARF1 promotes caveolin - 1 trafficking from the Golgi [ 48 ] . We speculate that CLN3 influences ARF1 dependent functions at both the plasma membrane and Golgi apparatus . Interestingly , one of the proteins identified by mass spectrometry analysis of CLN3 - pulled down proteins was GBF1 [ 49 ] . GBF1 is a well - described Arf1 - GEF critical to ARF1 activation and vesicular transport at the Golgi [ 50 , 51 ] and plasma membrane [ 52 , 53 ] . We predict that CLN3 may participate in GBF1 recruitment . Alternatively , CLN3 may affect protein localization indirectly by influencing the lipid microenvironment . Loss of CLN3 results in increased plasma membrane fluidity [ 13 ] and CLN3 has been implicated in lipid interaction / transport and metabolism [ 3 ] . Notably , proposed scaffolding and membrane effects are not necessarily exclusive ; CLN3 may interact with key proteins and trigger dynamic lipid modifications at sites of protein assemblage . In summary , we report elevated Cdc42 activation as a novel phenotype in CLN3 - deficient MBECs , which may be integral to multiple actin - dependent cellular functions . Endothelial and neuronal defects in Cdc42 activity may contribute to BBB defects and brain pathology in JNCL patients . We provide evidence that reduced ARF1 activity and subsequent impaired membrane recruitment of ARHGAP21 is the basis for the defective Cdc42 cycling . Thus , therapeutics to improve ARF1 activity , the trafficking of ARHGAP21 , or Cdc42 - GTPase activity may be effective treatments for JNCL . As drugs are being developed for other GTPases [ 54 ] , ARF1 or Cdc42 are potentially suitable targets for therapeutic development for JNCL , a currently untreatable , fatal neurodegenerative disease . Materials and Methods Mice All animal experiments were approved by the University of Iowa animal care and use committee and conducted in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines . In this study C57BL / 6J ( WT ) and Cln3 lacZ / lacZ ( Cln3 2 / 2 ) mice [ 10 ] on the C57BL / 6J background were used .

MBEC collection and cell lines MBECs from WT and Cln3 lacZ / lacZ mice were collected and cultured as described previously [ 55 ] . To minimize cell loss we employed puromycin selection as described previously [ 56 ] . To provide sufficient cells for the many cell based assays used here , we immortalized Cln3 lacZ / lacZ MBECs with retrovirus strategies to create the immortalized cell line Cln3 2 / 2 [ 13 ] . To create a CLN3 restored control cell line , Cln3 2 / 2 cells were transduced with FIV - Cln3 , which stably restored Cln3 expression ( Cln3 R ) . The immor - talized Cln3 2 / 2 and Cln3 R lines display brain endothelial markers and behave similar to respective primary CLN3 - null and WT MBEC cultures in functional assays [ 13 ] . Fluid - phase endocytosis Cells were incubated with Hoechst 33342 ( Pierce Biotechnol - ogy , Rockford , IL USA ) for 1 hour , then Alexa Fluor 488 or Rhodamine 10 , 000 MW dextran ( Invitrogen , Grand Island , NY USA ) was added to cell culture media to a final concentration of 0 . 5 and 0 . 25 mg / ml and cells incubated for 20 minutes . Media containing dextran was aspirated , and cells were washed briefly 3X with 37 u C PBS , removing excess dextran . To stop dextran intake and trafficking , cells were fixed in 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde at 37 u C for 10 minutes . This confined dextran signal to the plasma membrane and endocytic vesicles . In Fig . 2 A , B extracellular and plasma membrane fluorescence was quenched by adding mem - brane impermeable 200 mM Red - 40 [ 57 ] ( Spectrum , Gardena , CA USA ) . Images to assess internalized dextran were taken with an Olympus IX81 microscope and uptake was quantified with ImageJ using the same settings for each experimental group . Average intensity / cell area was determined for each field . A minimum of 6 fields were taken per experiment . Significance was tested by Student’s t - test . Images were assembled in Adobe Photoshop and levels , contrast , or brightness adjusted on the entire experimental group if necessary . Cdc42 and ARF1 activity assay Total cell lysates were collected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen to minimize GTP hydrolysis . Cdc42 - GTP and ARF1 - GTP were quantified by the G - Lisa H kit from Cytoskeleton Inc . ( Denver , CO USA ) as per the manufactures instructions except cells were not serum starved . A concentration of 0 . 8 mg / ml ( Cdc42 ) and 1 mg / ml ( ARF1 ) of cell lysate was added to the ELISA . Data were normalized to Cdc42 activity in wild type or Cln3 R cells and significance was determined by Student’s t - test . Cell lysis for Western blot Lysis buffer containing 0 . 5 % Triton x - 100 with protease and phosphatase inhibitors ( Roche , Madison , WI USA ) was added to MBECs culture plates and incubated on a rocking platform at 4 u C for 10 minutes . After removing cells using a cell scraper , nuclei Impaired Signaling in Batten Disease Brain Cells PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 7 May 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 5 | e96647 were briefly sonicated and pelleted by 1 , 000 6 g centrifugation and the supernatant was collected . Protein concentrations were determined by the DC protein assay ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA USA ) , and equilibrated . Samples were loaded and run on ( 4 – 12 % Tris - Bis NuPAGE ) gels , and transferred by western blot to PVDF membranes . Membranes were blocked with 5 % BSA , and immuno - blotted for Cdc42 , PAK1 , P - PAK1 , LIMK , b - actin , TRFNR , ARHGAP21 , ARF1 , GFP , and b - catenin using standard methods . Blots were incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 u C and secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature . Immunoreactive bands were quantified by densi - tometry using Quantity One software with the VersaDoc imaging system ( Bio - Rad ) . Band intensities were normalized to a house - keeping protein band ( b - actin , TRFNR , or b - catenin ) in the same lane and significance was determined by t - test . Membrane enrichment Cell culture medium was aspirated and membrane prep solution ( 0 . 25 M Sucrose , 50 mM MOPS , 2 mM EDTA , 2 mM EGTA pH 7 . 4 ) was added to MBECs , whereupon cells were immediately removed with a cell scraper . After brief sonication , nuclei were removed by a 2 , 500 6 g centrifugation for 5 minutes . Supernatant were collected and spun at 200 , 000 6 g for 1 hour to enrich for cell membranes . Membranes were resuspended in RIPA buffer and equal amounts of protein loaded onto gels for SDS - PAGE , western blot , and band quantification as above . SEM and filopodia quantification Sub - confluent cells were fixed with glutaraldehyde , dehydrated overnight , and coated with gold and platinum . The following day , filopodia were visualized with a Hitachi S4800 ( Dallas , TX USA ) scanning electron microscope . High magnification images were compiled with Adobe Photoshop and the multimeasure tool in ImageJ was used to measure cell membrane and filopodia length . Filopodia $ 2 m m were counted and measured , and filopodia per length of membrane determined . For each image the sum of filopodia lengths was divided by the number of filopodia to calculate the average filopodia length . Significance was assessed by a Student’s t - test . Scratch Assay A pipette tip was used to scratch a confluent monolayer of cells . Cellular debris from the scratch was removed by a PBS wash . Serial images were taken by an Olympus IX81 ( Center Valley , PA USA ) live cell microscope overnight . ImageJ was used to calculate the percent area remaining at each time point . Significance was assessed by 2 - way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc - test . MBEC transfection and constructs Subconfluent cells were transfected using the lipid - based Lipofectamine LTX ( Invitrogen , Grand Island , NY USA ) applying half of the manufactures suggested concentrations for endothelial cells . Experimental analysis was conducted the following day . The following constructs were used : hrGFP ( empty vector control ) , GFP - Cdc42 ( WT ) , dominant negative GFP - Cdc42 ( T17N ) , constitutively active GFP - Cdc42 ( Q61L ) [ 26 ] , GFP - ARF1 ( WT ) , dominant negative GFP - ARF1 ( T31N ) , constitutively active GFP - ARF1 ( Q71L ) [ 58 ] , GFP - ARHGAP21 ( amino acids 855 – 1346 ) [ 28 , 59 ] . Confocal microscopy After aspiration of cell culture media , cells were briefly rinsed in PBS ( 37 u C ) , fixed in 4 % PFA ( 37 u C ) , and permeabilized , and blocked with Image - iT H FX Signal Enhancer ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY USA ) . After an overnight incubation with Anti - ARHGAP21 ( Santa Cruz , Dallas , TX USA ) and 1 hour of secondary Ab ( 1 : 2000 ) cell were imaged on a Zeiss LSM710 ( Thornwood , NY USA ) microscope . TIRFM The Image - iT FX H signal enhancer protocol ( Invitrogen ) was followed for cell fixation , permeabilization , and prevention of nonspecific binding . Cells were incubated with ARHGAP21 primary antibody 1 : 300 ( Sigma ) overnight and imaged with a Leica AM TIRF Imaging System ( Leica Microsystems , Philadel - phia PA , USA ) . Images were taken with DIC and TIRF ( 90 nm penetration depth ) channels . LAS AF software ( Leica Micro - systems ) was used to quantify cell area in the DIC channel and TIRF intensity . The following equation was used to quantify images : Normalized TIRF int ensity ~ TIRF int ensity Cell area Supporting Information Figure S1 Altered actin structures in CLN3 - null MBECs . Subconfluent MBECs were fixed and stained with Acti - stain 488 which stains F - actin . Z - stacks were taken by confocal microscopy and ImageJ used to compile images .
