Mak Department of Chemistry , University of Southern California , Los Angeles , California 90089 - 0482 , USA ( Dated : March 23 , 2022 ) Large - scale computer simulations involving more than a million particles have been performed to study the melting transition in a two - dimensional hard disk ﬂuid . The van der Waals loop previously observed in the pressure - density relationship of smaller simulations is shown to be an artifact of ﬁnite - size eﬀects . Together with a detailed scaling analysis of the bond orientation order , the new results provide compelling evidence for the Halperin - Nelson - Young picture . Scaling analysis of the translational order also yields a lower bound for the melting density that is much higher than previously thought . PACS numbers : 64 . 60 . Fr , 64 . 70 . Dv A system of hard disks in two dimension ( 2D ) is one of the simplest models of a classical ﬂuid . But beneath the deceptive simplicity of this model , 2D hard disks exhibit a set of surprisingly rich behaviors . Unlike in three dimen - sions , a 2D solid possesses only quasi - long - range trans - lational order which decays algebraically to zero at large distances [ 1 ] . Instead of the usual ﬁrst - order transition in three dimensions , a 2D solid is also expected to melt into a liquid via two continuous transitions . The intervening phase called the “hexatic” was predicted by Halperin and Nelson [ 2 , 3 ] and Young [ 4 ] to possess quasi - long - range bond orientation order but no long - range translational order . Given the simplicity of the hard disk model , it would seem easy to either prove or disprove the Halperin - Nelson - Young ( HNY ) theory by detailed computer sim - ulation studies . But twenty - ﬁve year after the HNY the - ory was ﬁrst proposed , simulations that could deﬁnitively identify the nature of the melting transition are still lack - ing [ 5 ] . The ﬁrst simulation of 2D hard disks was carried out by Alder and Wainwright [ 6 ] . Based on the appear - ance of a van der Waals loop in the pressure , they con - cluded that the melting transition must be ﬁrst - order . Since then , as more computing power has become avail - able , simulations have been carried out with increasingly larger system sizes [ 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 ] , but instead of clarifying the picture , these simulations have provided conﬂicting conclusions about the nature of melting transition . One consensus that did emerge from the more recent simu - lation studies is that the 2D hard disk system is very sensitive to ﬁnite - size eﬀects near the melting transition . This is not unexpected if the transition is continuous , but compared to ﬂuids with a soft potential [ 26 ] the hard disk system is much more prone to ﬁnite - size errors and boundary eﬀects . In a simulation of up to N = 128 2 par - ticles , Zollweg and Chester [ 9 ] observed that the equi - libration time increased dramatically for densities very close to the melting transition – systems of this size were apparently not large enough to reach the scaling limit . The largest simulation that has been performed to date was carried out by Jaster with up to N = 256 2 particles [ 16 , 17 ] , and more recently for two higher densities with up to N = 1024 2 [ 24 ] . Even though a van der Waals loop was observed in the pressure at densities between ρ = 0 . 895 and 0 . 910 ( solid squares in Fig . 1 ) , Jaster showed using a scaling analysis that his data were also compatible with the HNY scenario . A van der Waals loop is often the sign of a ﬁrst - order transition , but it may also arise 0 . 87 0 . 88 0 . 89 0 . 9 0 . 91 0 . 92 0 . 93 ρ 7 . 8 7 . 9 8 8 . 1 P A 0 / N k T Jaster : N = 256 2 Present Work : N = 512 2 Present Work : N = 1024 2 Jaster : N = 512 2 Jaster : N = 1024 2 ρ i ρ m vdW loop Apparent FIG . 1 : Pressure of the hard disk ﬂuid as a function of den - sity .

The dotted line is a guide to the eye through Jaster’s data for N = 256 2 . The dashed and solid line are guides to the eye through the N = 512 2 and 1024 2 data in the present work . Note the presence of an apparent van der Waals ( vdW ) loop between ρ = 0 . 895 and 0 . 910 , which becomes shallower for increasingly larger size simulations . For N = 1024 2 , the van der Waals loop between ρ = 0 . 895 and 0 . 905 has disappeared completely , with a small decrease in the pressure still visible for ρ = 0 . 910 . The two arrows in - dicate the approximate locations of the isotropic - hexatic and hexatic - solid boundaries . 2 from ﬁnite - size errors . To deﬁnitively rule out a ﬁrst - order scenario , one must demonstrate that the van der Waals loop is a ﬁnite - size artifact , i . e . it must be shown to disappear with larger size simulations . Curiously , the same van der Waals loop was observed for two diﬀerent sizes in Jaster’s data – the pressure for N = 128 2 ( not shown in Fig . 1 ) and 256 2 coincide almost completely . In this letter , we describe a Monte Carlo study of 2D hard disks for up to N = 1024 2 = 1048576 particles . The calculations were carried out in the canonical ensemble , in a square box with periodic boundary condition and in a rectangular box with aspect ratio √ 3 : 2 for the higher densities . We worked with densities in the range ρ = 0 . 880 to 0 . 920 , which according to previous estimates should span the transition region [ 5 , 6 , 9 , 11 , 17 ] . Den - sities ρ are given in reduced units where the hard disk diameter is one . While the rationale for going to larger system size is to eliminate ﬁnite - size eﬀects , larger simulations also take longer to equilibrate . We have focused on N = 512 2 to try to carry out detailed simulations covering a large range of densities between ρ = 0 . 880 and 0 . 920 . At this size , one run at each density took several months of CPU time . Additional larger simulations with N = 1024 2 were performed for four densities between ρ = 0 . 895 and 0 . 910 in the vicinity of the van der Waals loop previously ob - served in smaller simulations . In contrast , Jaster’s recent simulations [ 24 ] focuses on a diﬀerent region in the phase diagram , oﬀering data for ρ = 0 . 918 at N = 1024 2 and two densities , ρ = 0 . 914 and 0 . 918 , for N = 512 2 . Two diﬀerent types of Monte Carlo moves were used for our simulations . The ﬁrst is a conventional Metropolis move , where each particle is displaced in a random direc - tion by a random amount . A second Monte Carlo move based on the cluster algorithm proposed by Dress and Krauth [ 27 ] and Liu and Luiijten [ 28 ] was also used . At the densities we worked with , neither algorithm is par - ticularly eﬃcient in causing very large rearrangements in the system conﬁguration . But by mixing two diﬀer - ent algorithms that have vastly diﬀerent properties , we hope to minimize equilibration problems characteristic of any single algorithm . One Monte Carlo step ( MCS ) in our simulation is deﬁned as having moved each parti - cle on the average once using the Metropolis algorithm , plus having made one global cluster update . The simula - tions reported here were carried out with no fewer than 5 million MCS for each density . Depending on the equi - libration rate , results from the last 1 to 3 million MCS were used to collect statistics . Two to four independent simulations were carried out for each density for simula - tions with a square box , and ﬁve to six for those with a rectangular box . The pressure P was calculated using the virial for - mula PA 0 / NkT = [ 1 + πρg ( 1 + ) / 2 ] √ 3 ρ / 2 , where g ( 1 + ) is the contact value of the pair correlation function and A 0 = √ 3 N / 2 is the closed - packed area of the system . The calculated pressure P is shown in Fig . 1 as a func - tion of density ρ for N = 512 2 ( open circles ) and for N = 1024 2 ( open triangles ) . Comparing the N = 512 2 and 1024 2 data to those from Jaster’s simulation with N = 256 2 , the two sets of data are almost identical for ρ ≤ 0 . 890 , but inside the range ρ = 0 . 895 to 0 . 910 , the larger size simulations produced a smaller pressure for ρ = 0 . 895 but larger pressures for ρ = 0 . 900 to 0 . 910 . It is therefore clear that the apparent van der Waals loop in the pressure is a result of ﬁnite - size eﬀects , and using even larger size simulations , this slight nonmonotonic decrease in the pressure should eventually vanish altogether . For the N = 1024 2 simulations , the van der Waals loops has completely disappeared between ρ = 0 . 895 and 0 . 905 , with a slight dip in P still visible for ρ = 0 . 910 . As ex - pected , ﬁnite - size eﬀects are indeed very pronounced in the transition region even for simulations of this magni - tude . Even though the evidence in Fig . 1 is compelling that the van der Waals loop is an artifact of ﬁnite - size eﬀects , these data alone cannot deﬁnitively rule out a ﬁrst - order melting transition . For this , wee need to carefully ana - lyze the ﬁnite size eﬀects . To disentangle the ﬁnite - size eﬀects , a detailed scaling analysis must be performed on the simulation data . We have found a subblock scaling analysis [ 11 , 26 ] to be useful for this purpose . With this method , a single large size simulation provides informa - tion on multiple length scales simultaneously . The sub - block scaling analysis was applied to the bond orientation order as well as the translational order . The bond orientation order is given by ψ 26 = | ( 6 N ) − 1 P l P j exp ( 6 iθ lj ) | 2 , where the sum goes over each particles l and its nearest neighbors j and θ lj is the angle between the line from l to j with some ﬁxed refer - ence axis . According to HNY theory , ψ 6 should have only short - range order in the isotropic phase and quasi - long - range order in the hexatic phase with exponent η 6 ≤ 1 / 4 . We calculated ψ 6 for subblock sizes of L B = L / 64 , L / 32 . . . L , where L is the full length of the box and plot the results in Fig . 2 . For ρ ≤ 0 . 895 , ψ 6 clearly scales to zero , but for ρ ≥ 0 . 900 , ψ 6 appears to scale to a ﬁnite value . To establish the precise scaling behavior , we plot ln ψ 26 vs . the natural log of the length of the subblock L B in Fig . 3 for the N = 512 2 simulations . According to HNY theory , this plot should show a slope − η 6 in the hexatic phase and − 2 in the isotropic phase where there is only short - range order . Figure 3 shows that for both ρ = 0 . 880 ( solid triangles ) and 0 . 890 ( open diamonds ) , the bond orientation order has no long - ranged correla - tions in the long length scale limit , and the size of the simulations was large enough to reach the scaling limit . We can safely conclude that densities ρ ≤ 0 . 890 are in the isotropic phase . On the other hand , for the high - est densities ρ = 0 . 905 ( solid diamonds ) and 0 . 910 ( open squares ) , the bond orientation order shows an algebraic decay with an exponent η 6 much smaller than 1 / 4 .

The inset shows an expanded view for ρ = 0 . 895 , 0 . 900 and 0 . 905 in the large length scale region . is consistent with the interpretation that these densities are either inside the hexatic or the solid phase . For the two densities ρ = 0 . 895 and 0 . 900 , the interpre - tation of the subblock scaling plots is more involved . The inset in Fig . 3 shows an expanded view of their behav - iors in the large length scale limit . For ρ = 0 . 900 ( open circles ) , the bond orientation order shows a slope that is very close to − 1 / 4 at large length scales . In the HNY scenario , this is consistent with a density inside the hex - atic phase , very close to the hexatic - isotropic boundary ρ i . These evidence suggest that ρ i < ∼ 0 . 900 . For ρ = 0 . 895 ( closed squares ) , the subblock scaling plot changes slope twice , ﬁrst at L / 2 and then more gradually between L / 4 and L / 8 . The ﬁrst abrupt slope change at L / 2 is an artifact of the subblock scaling analy - sis which has been discussed by Weber , Marx and Binder [ 11 ] . The reason for this sudden slope change is that the subblocks and the full box actually belongs to two diﬀer - ent ensembles – the canonical for the full box and some - thing resembling the grand canonical for the subblocks . It is therefore possible for the full box to exhibit a diﬀer - ent scaling behavior compared to the subblocks when the correlation length exceeds the size of the simulation box , in which case the full box data point must be excluded from the scaling analysis . When this is done , the scaling behavior suggests that the orientation order decays alge - braically with an exponent larger than 1 / 4 . But clearly the scaling limit has not been reached , so it is possible that this exponent will continue to increase with lengths beyond the size of the present simulation . These evidence suggest that ρ = 0 . 895 must still be inside the isotropic phase but is very close to the isotropic - hexatic boundary . Taken together , the pressure data and the subblock scaling analysis of the bond orientation order reveal a consistent picture . For densities ρ ≤ 0 . 895 , the system is in the isotropic phase . The van der Waals loop in the pressure between ρ = 0 . 895 and 0 . 910 observed in previ - ous simulations is most certainly due to ﬁnite - size eﬀects . The bond orientation correlation length increases when the isotropic - hexatic boundary ρ i is approached from be - low and it changes from short - range correlation to an al - gebraic decay with η 6 close to 1 / 4 at ρ i < ∼ 0 . 900 , which is consistent with previous estimates [ 17 ] . Above ρ i , the exponent η 6 decreases quickly from 1 / 4 to zero when the hexatic - solid boundary ρ m is approached from below . These ﬁndings are consistent with the HNY scenario . The fact that η 6 → 0 for ρ → 0 . 910 has been used previously to suggest that the hexatic - solid boundary is at ρ m ≈ 0 . 910 [ 11 , 17 ] . The recent data of Jaster , how - ever , have placed ρ m at a much higher value ≈ 0 . 933 [ 24 ] . To more accurately locate the hexatic - solid boundary ρ m , we turn to a subblock scaling analysis of the translational order ψ 2 t = | N − 1 P l exp ( i ~ k · ~ r l ) | 2 , where the wavevector ~ k has magnitude 2 π / ( √ 3 / 2 ρ ) 1 / 2 . In the solid phase , ψ 2 t is expected to decay algebraically with exponent η t = 1 / 3 . The results for three densities , ρ = 0 . 900 , 0 . 910 and 0 . 920 , are shown in Fig . 4 for the N = 512 2 sim - ulations in both a square and a rectangular box with a √ 3 : 2 aspect ratio . For ρ = 0 . 900 ( triangles ) and 0 . 910 ( squares ) , the results are consistent with no long - range translational order in the large length scale limit for both box geometries . This indicates that both of these densi - ties are inside the hexatic phase . On the other hand , for ρ = 0 . 920 , the translational order shows apparently dif - ferent scaling behaviors for the two box geometries – no long - range order in the square box but quasi - long - range translational order with an apparent exponent η t > 1 / 3 for the rectangular box . In fact , comparing the two dif - 4 1 - 1 2 - 1 4 - 1 8 - 1 16 - 1 32 - 1 64 - 1 L B / L 0 2 4 6 8 l n [ ψ t 2 ( L B ) / ψ t 2 ( L ) ] 0 . 910 0 . 900 0 . 920 1 - 1 2 - 1 4 - 1 8 - 1 16 - 1 32 - 1 64 - 1 0 . 900 0 . 910 0 . 920 Square Rectangular FIG . 4 : Subblock scaling analysis for the translational order parameter for the N = 512 2 simulations in a square box and a rectangular box . The dotted line corresponds to a slope of − 2 and the dashed line a slope of − 1 / 3 . ferent box geometries , we found that the rectangular box simulations at this density were much slower to equili - brate , leading to the larger error bars on the right panel of Fig . 4 for ρ = 0 . 920 . Since the translational correlation length is expected to diverge according to HNY theory as ρ approaches the melting density ρ m [ 3 ] , the rectangular box used for the simulations at ρ = 0 . 920 was probably too small to reach the scaling limit . Therefore , we be - lieve that ρ = 0 . 920 is most likely still inside the hexatic phase and has not yet reached the hexatic - solid bound - ary . This establishes a lower bound for ρ m , one that is much higher than the value previously suggested [ 11 , 17 ] . But this new lower bound is consistent with the recent estimate provided by Jaster based on simulations with N up to 1024 2 [ 24 ] . Since the pressure at ρ = 0 . 920 ( see Fig . 1 ) is much higher than the pressure inside the appar - ent van der Waals loop , this new lower bound for ρ m also provides evidence corroborating the conclusion we have drawn from the size - dependence of the pressure - density data in Fig . 1 that the apparent van der Waals loop in the pressure is not related to a ﬁrst - order transition . In conclusion , we have shown using large - scale com - puter simulations with more than a million particles that the apparent van der Waals loop observed previ - ously in smaller simulations is an artifact of ﬁnite - size eﬀects . In conjunction with a detailed scaling analysis , the data provide compelling evidence for a continuous isotropic - hexatic transition as predicted by HNY theory at ρ i < ∼ 0 . 900 . Scaling analysis of the translational or - der also yields a lower bound for the melting density , ρ m > 0 . 920 , one that is much higher than previously thought , providing additional evidence that the apparent van der Waals loop is not due to a ﬁrst - order transition .
