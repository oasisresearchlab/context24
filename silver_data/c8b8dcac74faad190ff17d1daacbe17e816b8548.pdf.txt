Here we identify the potent Rho regulatory protein , p190 RhoGAP ( GTPase - activating protein ) , as the princi - pal Src substrate detected in the developing and mature nervous system . We also find that mice lacking functional p190 RhoGAP exhibit defects in axon guidance and fasciculation . p190 RhoGAP is co - enriched with F - actin in the distal tips of axons , and overexpressing p190 RhoGAP in neuroblastoma cells promotes extensive neurite outgrowth , indicating that p190 RhoGAP may be an important regulator of Rho - mediated actin reorganization in neuronal growth cones . p190 RhoGAP transduces signals downstream of cell - surface adhesion molecules , and we find that p190 - RhoGAP - mediated neurite outgrowth is promoted by the extracellular matrix protein laminin . Together with the fact that mice lacking neural adhesion molecules or Src kinases also exhibit defects in axon outgrowth , guidance and fasciculation , our results suggest that p190 RhoGAP mediates a Src - dependent adhesion signal for neuritogene - sis to the actin cytoskeleton through the Rho GTPase . T he Src and Fyn tyrosine kinases are highly expressed in the developing nervous system 1 , 2 , and their role in embryogenesis is being explored with mouse knockouts 3 – 5 . Although the indi - vidual Src and Fyn knockout mice are viable , mice lacking both kinases die perinatally , indicating some degree of functional redun - dancy 6 . Src and Fyn are concentrated in neuronal growth cones 7 , 8 , suggesting that they may have a role in axon growth and guidance . Indeed , Src / Fyn double knockout mice exhibit defects in axon guidance and fasciculation 9 , and cultured neurons lacking either Src or Fyn exhibit defects in neurite outgrowth in response to cell - adhesion molecules 10 , 11 . Although it is likely that the phosphorylat - ed substrates of these kinases mediate their biological functions , identifying the relevant substrates in vivo and determining their roles in the embryonic nervous system have been difficult . Numerous studies indicate that Src has a role in regulating cell morphology and adhesion . For example , expression of activated Src in fibroblasts alters cell morphology and reduces adhesion to the extracellular matrix 12 . In addition , Src associates directly with focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) and localizes to focal adhesions 12 . Src sub - strates that have been identified in fibroblasts include several pro - teins that regulate cell morphology , motility and adhesion , such as p130 CAS ( Crk - associated substrate ) , paxillin and p120 catenin 12 . Increased Src activity , as well as phosphorylation of Src substrates , occurs in response to activation of integrins and other adhesion molecules , suggesting that Src may be important in transducing signals for cell - matrix interactions to downstream targets that reg - ulate adhesion 12 . A prominent Src substrate in fibroblasts is p190 RhoGAP ( GTPase - activating protein ) 13 , 14 , which was first observed as the principal p120 - RasGAP - associated protein in Src - transformed fibroblasts 15 . Direct phosphorylation of p190 RhoGAP by Src kinas - es regulates RasGAP association 16 , 17 . p190 RhoGAP contains an amino - terminal GTPase domain 18 and a carboxy - terminal RhoGAP domain 19 , which preferentially regulates the Rho GTPase 20 . Rho GTPases may be important in numerous cellular processes , including transcriptional regulation , membrane trafficking , and reorganizing the actin cytoskeleton in response to extracellular signals 21 . This last property is required for many cellular activities such as migration , morphological transformation and adhesion . Accumulating evi - dence from in vitro studies implicates p190 RhoGAP as a signalling intermediate in response to cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix 22 – 26 . We reported previously that p190 RhoGAP is specifically expressed at high levels in the developing mouse nervous system , and that mice lacking a functional p190 RhoGAP protein die peri - natally with defects in the morphogenesis of neural tissues 27 . Here we identify p190 RhoGAP as the main tyrosine - phosphorylated protein detected in the developing as well as the mature nervous system ; we also determine that the Src and Fyn kinases are respon - sible for most of this phosphorylation in vivo . In addition to the previously identified defects in p190 RhoGAP mutant mice , we have identified defects in axon guidance and fasciculation in these animals . Moreover , overexpression of p190 RhoGAP in cultured neuroblastoma cells results in rapid and extensive neurite out - growth , indicating that p190 RhoGAP may be a potent regulator of Rho - mediated actin rearrangements that direct neuritogenesis in vivo . Results p190 RhoGAP is the principal tyrosine - phosphorylated protein detected in the nervous system . The previously generated p190 RhoGAP mutant mice die perinatally with defects in the morpho - genesis of neuroepithelial tissues 27 . Because p190 RhoGAP has been identified as a prominent Src substrate in fibroblasts , and Src kinas - es have also been implicated in neuronal function , we examined the tyrosine phosphorylation status of p190 RhoGAP in the developing nervous system . We found that p190 RhoGAP is in fact the most prominent phosphotyrosine - containing protein detectable in whole - brain extracts by anti - phosphotyrosine immunoblotting ( Fig . 1a , c ) . The observed gel band was identified as p190 RhoGAP by its com - plete absence in brain lysates from p190 RhoGAP – / – animals ( Fig . 1 ) , © 2001 Macmillan Magazines Ltd articles NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 3 APRIL 2001 http : / / cellbio . nature . com 362 and was confirmed by an immunodepletion experiment using anti - p190 RhoGAP antibodies ( data not shown ) . Tyrosine phosphorylation of p190 RhoGAP in brain is readily detectable throughout embryogenesis , and in adult animals p190 RhoGAP is abundantly phosphorylated and associated with RasGAP in all regions of brain and spinal cord ( Fig . 1c , d ) . p190 RhoGAP is also phosphorylated prominently and complexed with p120 RasGAP in several neuronal and glia cell lines , indicating that the observed phosphorylation is not restricted to cell type ( data not shown ) . p190 RhoGAP is phosphorylated in brain by Src and Fyn kinases . Among the Src family kinases , Src and Fyn are expressed predomi - nantly during neural development . Therefore , we tested the possi - bility that Src and Fyn are responsible for the observed p190 RhoGAP phosphorylation . In brains from Src – / – or Fyn – / – newborn mice , a slight reduction in p190 RhoGAP phosphorylation is observed ; however , in Src – / – Fyn – / – double knockout mice , the majority of detectable phosphorylated p190 RhoGAP in brain is eliminated ( Fig . 1e ) . In addition , p190 - RhoGAP - associated RasGAP is nearly undetectable in these brains ( Fig . 1e ) . Two observations suggest that p190 RhoGAP is directly phos - phorylated by Src kinases : first , the known phosphorylated tyrosines in p190 RhoGAP lie within consensus sites for Src phos - phorylation 17 ; and second , purified Src can phosphorylate p190 RhoGAP directly on these sites in vitro 17 . Thus , Src and Fyn are responsible for most p190 tyrosine phosphorylation in the nervous system , and this phosphorylation is required for RasGAP / p190 RhoGAP association . We also observed a significant reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of p190 RhoGAP in mice lacking a third neural - expressed kinase , Yes , which also seems to be partially redundant in function with Src and Fyn 28 ( data not shown ) . Axon guidance defects in p190 RhoGAP mutant mice . We report - ed previously that a defect in corpus callosum formation in p190 RhoGAP – / – animals is due to a failure in cerebral hemisphere fusion , rather than a defect in axon guidance . However , the well - documented role for Rho GTPases and Src kinases in growth cone dynamics prompted us to examine additional axonal tracts in p190 RhoGAP mutants . First , we determined that p190 RhoGAP is expressed in cultured neurons and , along with F - actin , is enriched in the distal tips of neurites ( Fig . 2a , b ) , consistent with a role in regulating Rho - mediated growth cone function . Next , we observed that the axonal projections of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure , although initiated , never reach the midline , and instead project ventrally ( Fig . 2c – f ) . This defect was seen in each of numerous homozygous mutants ( > 30 ) , but was never seen in wild - type or heterozygous mutant animals ( > 30 ) . Midline axon guidance is not globally affected , because we saw no defects in spinal cord commissures ( 0 / 4 examined ; Fig . 2g – j ) . Notably , the roofplate is misshapen in mutant spinal cords ( Fig . 2h , j ) ( 4 / 4 examined ) , consistent with the previously observed defect in neural tube closure 27 . In the cerebral cortex of mutant animals , we found clear defects in the formation of the major subcortical axon tracts , including a massive reduction in thickness in the intermediate zone at embry - onic day ( E ) 16 . 5 ( Fig . 3a – d ) ( 25 / 25 examined ) . The subplate layer is largely unaffected , as indicated by Nissl staining ( Fig . 3c , d ) and confirmed by MAP2 staining 29 ( Fig . 3e , f ) , suggesting a specific reduction in subcortical axon number . Moreover , neuronal differ - entiation seems to be largely normal in the subplate of the mutant animals ( Fig . 3e , f , k , l ) . Immunostaining of the cell - adhesion molecule L1 , a specific marker of subcortical axon tracts 30 , confirmed that axonal numbers are severely reduced in the intermediate zone of the mutants ( Fig . 3g – j ) . Similar results were obtained with anti - b III - tubulin , another marker of early neuronal differentiation and axonal outgrowth ( Fig . 3k , l ) . These results indicate that p190 RhoGAP is required for proper outgrowth and guidance of a subset of axons during devel - opment . Moreover , the observed defects seem to be 100 % pene - trant in mutant animals . Axon fasciculation defects in p190 RhoGAP mutant mice .

L1 immunostaining of E16 . 5 cerebral cortex revealed numerous fasci - cles ectopically invading the cortical plate in p190 RhoGAP mutants ( Fig . 4a – c ) ; such ‘wandering axons’ are never observed in wild - type cortex ( Fig . 4d ) ( 12 / 12 examined ) . The results suggest a failure of fasciculation , but do not rule out aberrant axonal guid - ance . To analyse fasciculation more specifically , we examined the trajectories of cranial nerves in the peripheral nervous system . We observed that a subset of cranial nerves exhibit abnormal fas - ciculation in the p190 RhoGAP mutant mice ( 6 / 6 examined ) . Thus , the trigeminal nerve is clearly more diffuse in the mutants ( Fig . 4e , f ) . Similar defects are seen in the ganglion of the vagus nerve ( Xg ) and the projections of the facial and hypoglossal nerves ( VIIn and XIIn ) ( Fig . 4g , h ; and data not shown ) . Other projections , such as the oculomotor nerve ( IIIn ) and dorsal root ganglia appear normal in mutant embryos ( Figs 4 e and f ) .

In mutant embryos , the general projection of these rootlets is correct , although more diffuse , and some nerves are seen extending aber - rantly in the dorsal direction ( Fig . 4g , h ) . Together , these findings support a role for p190 RhoGAP in axonal outgrowth , guidance and fasciculation in the developing nervous system . p190 RhoGAP promotes extensive neurite outgrowth in neurob - lastoma cells . The observed axon deficits potentially indicate a mas - sive failure of process outgrowth . Therefore , we analysed neurite outgrowth in primary cultures of cortical neurons . Mutant neurons do not differ from wild - type cells in the number of primary neu - rites per cell ( length > 1 cell body diameter ; mutant , 3 . 0 – 0 . 09 ( mean – s . e . m . ) , n = 212 ; wild - type , 2 . 9 – 0 . 09 , n = 200 ) or in the number of long primary neurites per cell ( length > 3 cell body diameters ; mutant , 1 . 4 – 0 . 06 ; wild - type , 1 . 3 – 0 . 05 ) . Moreover , both neuronal morphology and growth cone motili - ty , as measured by time - lapse video microscopy , are apparently normal in the mutants ( data not shown ) . Possibly , the absence of obvious differences between wild - type and mutant cells reflects functional redundancy provided by the very closely related protein , p190 - B , which is also expressed throughout the brain 23 . Such redun - dancy may also account for the fact that neurite defects in the p190 RhoGAP mutants are restricted to a subset of axon tracts , despite widespread expression of the gene . To establish a direct role for p190 RhoGAP in neurite outgrowth , therefore , we turned to over - expression studies in cultured neuroblastoma cells . Rho family GTPases regulate neurite outgrowth in N1E - 115 murine neuroblastoma cells 32 , 33 , a line derived from the Neuro - 2A ( N2A ) line—another well - characterized murine neuroblastoma line . These cells undergo neuronal differentiation associated with extensive neurite outgrowth following serum withdrawal ( Fig . 5a , b ; and ref . 38 ) . We found that Rho inactivation using the bacterial Rho - specific toxin , C3 transferase , induces a similar differentiation effect in N2A cells ( Fig . 5c ) , indicating that Rho regulation affects Vg VII / VIIIg IIIn Vop Vmx Vmn IX X DRG XIIn XIIn DRG Vg VII / VIIIg b – / – a – / – c – / – d + / + e + / + + / + g f – / – – / – h Xg Xg Figure 4 Aberrant axonal fasciculation in p190 RhoGAP mutant mice . a – d , L1 staining of coronal sections of the cerebral cortex at E16 . 5 .

Similarly , expression of p190 RhoGAP induces extensive outgrowth of long and highly branched neurites within 16 h of transfection ( Fig . 5d ) . This effect is completely dependent on the Rho regulatory func - tion of p190 RhoGAP , as a small deletion of the RhoGAP catalytic domain inhibits the ability of p190 RhoGAP to promote neurite outgrowth ( Fig . 5e ) . Expression of a mutationally activated Rho mutant ( V14Rho ) completely blocks the ability of p190 RhoGAP to promote neurite outgrowth ( Fig . 5f ) , confirming that the effect of p190 RhoGAP is mediated by Rho . Expression of the isolated GTPase domain of p190 RhoGAP does not induce neurite out - growth ( Fig . 5g ) , whereas expression of a truncated form of p190 RhoGAP that resembles the GTPase - deficient form that is expressed in the mutant mice results in partial neurite outgrowth ( Fig . 5h ) , indicating that this molecule is defective , but can exert weak biological activity when overexpressed . Previous studies have indicated that N2A differentiation induced by serum withdrawal results predominantly in the forma - tion of axons , as opposed to dendrites 34 . Notably , whereas the C3 - and p190 - RhoGAP - induced neurites largely resemble axons in the presence of serum ( Fig . 5c , d ) , p190 - RhoGAP - induced neurites ( but not C3 - induced neurites ) largely resemble dendrites in the absence of serum ( Fig . 5i , j ) . This suggests that p190 RhoGAP may be functioning by a mechanism that does not only involve Rho inactivation , and that p190 RhoGAP activity is influenced by some component of serum . p190 RhoGAP has been implicated in signal transduction downstream of adhesion molecules . We therefore examined the possibility that p190 RhoGAP mediates neurite outgrowth in response to adhesion - mediated signalling . In p190 - RhoGAP - trans - fected N2A cells , neurite outgrowth is strongly promoted within 1 h of plating on a surface coated with the integrin - binding extra - cellular matrix protein laminin ( Fig . 6a , b ) . Conversely , p190 - RhoGAP - transfected cells re - plated on polylysine do not exhibit substantial neurite outgrowth even 5 h after plating ( Fig . 6c – f ) . Moreover , p190 - RhoGAP - induced neurite outgrowth in response to laminin is blocked by treating cells with a Src kinase inhibitor ( data not shown ) . These results indicate that p190 RhoGAP may transduce a Src - dependent signal from cell - surface adhesion mole - cules to promote neurite outgrowth . Discussion We have identified p190 RhoGAP as the predominant Src / Fyn sub - strate in the developing and adult nervous system . In neurons , Src kinase activity is concentrated in growth cones 8 , where it might function , in part , to regulate p190 RhoGAP activity , which we have found to be similarly localized . Indeed , evidence indicates that tyrosine phosphorylation facilitates the interaction of p190 RhoGAP with activated Rho in vivo 35 , and in fibroblasts the ability articles NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 3 APRIL 2001 http : / / cellbio . nature . com 365 a b c d e f g h i j Figure 5 Induction of neuritogenesis in Neuro - 2A cells by overexpression of p190 RhoGAP . a , b , Phase - contrast micrographs of N2A cells grown for 24 h with ( a ) and without ( b ) serum . c – j , Immunofluorescence detection of cells transfected with the following expression plasmids : C3 transferase ( c ) ; wild - type p190 RhoGAP ( d ) ; p190 RhoGAP with RhoGAP catalytic domain mutation ( e ) ; wild - type p190 RhoGAP plus constitutively active mutant RhoA ( V14RhoA ) ( f ) ; p190 RhoGAP lacking the N - terminal GTPase domain ( g ) ; isolated N - terminal GTPase domain of p190 RhoGAP ( h ) ; C3 transferase plus 24 h without serum ( i ) ; wild - type p190 RhoGAP plus 24 h without serum ( j ) . b a c e d f Figure 6 Promotion of integrin - mediated neuritogenesis by overexpression of p190 RhoGAP .

In addition , Src phosphorylation of p190 RhoGAP leads directly to formation of a RasGAP / p190 RhoGAP complex , suggesting that this protein may function in coordinating Ras - and Rho - mediated signalling pathways , both of which have been implicated in neuronal differentiation and morphogenesis 21 . Although the precise signalling role of p190 RhoGAP in the RasGAP complex is not known , data have established that the Src homology 3 domain of RasGAP , whose accessibility is regulated by interaction with p190 RhoGAP 16 , transduces a Rho - mediated sig - nal that directs actin reorganization in response to Src activation 37 . Although mice lacking RasGAP also display defects in neural devel - opment , they die at mid - gestation 38 , and it is therefore difficult to relate the RasGAP and p190 RhoGAP knockout phenotypes . It is notable that two of the most prominent Src / Fyn substrates detected in the developing brain , p190 RhoGAP and p125 FAK , have been implicated in regulating the actin cytoskeleton in response to integrin activation 23 , 39 , suggesting that the regulation of actin dynamics in response to extracellular signals is critical to nor - mal neural development . p190 RhoGAP and FAK are also promi - nently tyrosine phosphorylated in the adult brain , consistent with an additional role for Src kinases and actin regulation in the func - tioning mature nervous system . Both actin reorganization and Src kinases have been implicated in long - term potentiation in the adult nervous system 3 , 40 , 41 ; thus , actin reorganization that accompanies long - term potentiation 41 may require signalling pathways similar to those that regulate the morphogenesis of the developing nervous system . Although the neonatal lethality of the p190 RhoGAP mutant mice precludes examination of the role of p190 RhoGAP in adult neural plasticity , future studies with an inducible knockout might reveal a role for the protein in this and other functions of the mature brain . The p190 RhoGAP mutant mice are defective for several aspects of neural development in which both neural adhesion molecules and Src kinases have been implicated previously . In light of these in vivo data , and our finding that p190 RhoGAP promotes Src - dependent , integrin - mediated neurite outgrowth in neuroblastoma cells , we propose that the engagement of neural adhesion molecules results in Src activation and subsequent p190 RhoGAP phosphory - lation in the developing brain . Such a signalling pathway most probably influences the various Rho - mediated actin reorganization events required for neural development , including the axonal guid - ance and fasciculation processes that are disrupted in the p190 RhoGAP mutant mice . Moreover , the defects in the morphogenesis of neuroepithelial tissues observed in p190 RhoGAP mutant mice may reflect disruption of the same pathways 27 . Previous studies have shown that integrin / cell adhesion molecule - dependent signal transduction pathways are mediated by the Src kinases . For example , integrin and L1 signalling require Src activation 11 , 28 , cell adhesion molecule and neuronal cell adhesion molecule ( NCAM ) , as well as some of the cadherins , associates directly with Fyn 42 , 43 . In cultured neurons , activation of L1 or NCAM results in a rapid induction of the tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins 44 , and neurons lacking the Src or Fyn kinase are defective for neurite outgrowth on L1 or NCAM substrates , respec - tively 10 , 11 . Src and Fyn , as well as L1 , control axon fasciculation in the central nervous system 9 , 31 . Experiments using fibroblasts lack - ing Src family members have shown that integrin engagement leads to inactivation of Rho through a mechanism requiring Src kinases , and that Rho inhibition correlates with Src - dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of p190 RhoGAP 22 . These findings indicate that p190 RhoGAP mediates Src - dependent adhesion signalling to the actin cytoskeleton , and that cytoskeletal modulation almost cer - tainly involves the Rho GTPase . All of these data are consistent with our model for a Src / p190 RhoGAP adhesion pathway , which seeks to link the observed defects in the developing brain , the in vivo analysis of protein tyro - sine phosphorylation , and the results of neuroblastoma cell - culture studies . Significantly , brain defects seen in Src / Fyn mutant mice resemble those seen in p190 RhoGAP mutant mice . Of particular interest are the axon guidance and fasciculation defects described in the olfactory system of Src / Fyn double - mutant mice at E11 . 5 ( ref . 9 ) : the olfactory nerve is significantly defasciculated and axons ‘wander’ from the normal trajectory . These fasciculation defects are strongly reminiscent of the defas - ciculation of cranial nerves detected at E10 . 5 in the p190 RhoGAP – / – mice described here , and the wandering behaviour of olfactory axons reflects a similar disruption of axon guidance as that detected in the E16 . 5 cerebral cortex of p190 RhoGAP – / – mice . Notably , the Src / Fyn double - mutant mice , like the p190 RhoGAP – / – mice , die perinatally with axon guidance and fasciculation defects . However , additional functional redundancy provided by the tyro - sine kinase , Yes ( which also appears to phosphorylate p190 RhoGAP in brain ) , and the p190 - RhoGAP - related p190 - B protein , together with the fact that there are likely to be additional Src fam - ily substrates in brain , make it difficult to relate the phenotypes among these various knockout animals in an unequivocal manner . Thus , definitive confirmation of the proposed relationships between Src kinase activity , p190 RhoGAP function and adhesion - mediated morphogenetic events awaits further genetic analysis . In addition to adhesion molecules , many different secreted growth factors , including epidermal growth factor 15 , can promote tyrosine phosphorylation of p190 RhoGAP , suggesting that signals transduced by the numerous brain - expressed receptor tyrosine kinases may be mediated by p190 RhoGAP as well . Such receptors have also been implicated in a variety of morphogenetic events during neural development 45 , 46 . In addition , mice lacking the Eph family receptor , EphB2 ( Nuk ) , exhibit an anterior commissure guidance defect very similar to that seen in p190 RhoGAP mutant mice , suggesting that Eph ligands might signal through p190 RhoGAP 47 . Significantly , EphB2 has been observed to associate with the binding partner of p190 RhoGAP—p120 RasGAP 48 . The fact that p190 RhoGAP is expressed widely throughout the nervous sys - tem at all stages of development , and is highly tyrosine phosphory - lated in all regions of the brain , suggests that it is probably a com - mon mediator of several diverse extracellular signals that affect many morphogenetic processes by precisely modulating Rho GTPase activity . Methods Animals and genotyping . Generation and genotyping of p190 RhoGAP – / – mice were performed as described 27 . Immunostaining of cultured neurons . We prepared primary cultures of hippocampal neurons from fetal rats ( E18 . 5 ) . Hippocampi were dis - sociated with trypsin as described 49 , plated at low density ( 2 , 000 per cm 2 ) onto polylysine - coated glass coverslips in DMEM / 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , and allowed to attach for 4h , at which time the medium was replaced with Neurobasal medium containing B - 27 supplements ( GibcoBRL ) . After 3d , the cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS ( 20min ) , rinsed in PBS , permeabilized in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 / PBS ( 1min ) and blocked with 1 % normal goat serum ( NGS ) , 0 . 1 % bovine serum albu - min ( BSA ) in PBS ( 1h ) . p190 RhoGAP antibody was diluted 1 : 50 in 0 . 1 % BSA / PBS and applied to coverslips overnight . After rinsing , labelling was detected with Cy2 - conjugated goat anti - mouse ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ; 1 : 200 dilution in 0 . 1 % BSA / PBS ) in the presence of Alexa 594 - conjugated phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) for 1h . Analysis of neurite outgrowth in cortical neurons . Primary cultures of cortical neurons were prepared from E18 . 5 mice using Neurobasal media contain - ing B - 27 supplements ( GibcoBRL ) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations . Cortices were dissociated in calcium - and magnesium - free Hank’s balanced saline , plated at low density ( 5 , 000 per cm 2 ) in polylysine - coated vessels , fixed after 3 or 8d as described above , and kept in PBS . We scored neurite numbers under phase contrast . Immunostaining and Nissl staining of tissue sections . Whole embryos ( E10 . 5 – 14 . 5 ) or heads ( E16 . 5 ) were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4°C for 2 – 3h or overnight , respectively . After fixation , whole embryos , dissected brains or whole heads were washed with PBS , cryoprotected in PBS / 30 % sucrose overnight , sectioned on a cryostat ( 10 – 14 m m ) and mounted on slides ( Superfrost Plus , Fisher Scientific ) , which were stored at - 20 (cid:176) C until staining . For immunofluorescence , sections were dried in air for 30min , washed with PBS , blocked and perme - abilized in block solution ( 5 % NGS , goat - anti - mouse F ( ab ¢ ) 2 fragments ( 65 m gml - 1 ; Jackson © 2001 Macmillan Magazines Ltd ImmunoResearch ) , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS ) for 30 – 60min , washed briefly with PBS and then incu - bated with primary antibody diluted in 1 % NGS , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 2h . Subsequently , sec - tions were washed with PBS and incubated with Cy3 - conjugated secondary antibody for 1h . After PBS washes , sections were mounted using polyvinyl alcohol - based aqueous mounting medium . For F - actin and L1 staining , sections were treated as above , omitting the F ( ab ¢ ) 2 fragments in the block solution . Sections were incubated with fluorescent phalloidin for 1h followed by PBS washes and mounting . For double labelling of L1 and MAP2 , sections were treated as above , using biotinylated goat anti - rabbit and fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - conjugated goat anti - mouse secondary anti - bodies , followed by a 30 - min incubation with rhodamine red - X - conjugated streptavidin . Whole - mount immunohistochemistry of E10 . 5 embryos with the NF - M antibody ( monoclonal 2H3 from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank ( DSHB ) , Dept of Biological Sciences , Univ . Iowa ) was per - formed essentially as described 50 . The p190 RhoGAP primary antibody ( Transduction Laboratories ) was used at 1 : 50 dilution ; the TAG - 1 antibody ( monoclonal 3 . 1C12 ; DSHB ) at 1 : 100 ; the L1 antibody ( rabbit polyclonal RaL1CD , provided by V . Lemmon ) at 1 : 1000 ; the MAP - 2 antibody ( monoclonal 5F9 , provided by K . Kosik ) at 1 : 500 ; the b III - tubulin antibody ( monoclonal SDL . 3D10 ; Sigma ) at 1 : 400 , Biotin - , Cy3 - and FITC - conjugated goat - anti - mouse and goat anti - rabbit secondary antibodies ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) were diluted 1 : 500 . Rhodamine red - X - conjugated streptavidin ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) was used at 3 m gml - 1 ) . FITC - conjugated phalloidin ( Sigma ) was diluted 1 : 200 , rhodamine - conjugated phalloidin was diluted 1 : 500 . We carried out Nissl staining of cryostat sections as described 27 . Protein expression and phosphorylation . Methods for analysis of p190 RhoGAP protein expression , tyrosine phosphorylation and association with RasGAP are given elsewhere 16 . We prepared tissue lysates by homogenizing tissues in ice - cold lysis buffer ( 50mM HEPES pH7 . 4 , 150mM NaCl , 1 . 5mM MgCl 2 , 5mM EGTA , 10 % glycerol , 1 % Triton X - 100 ) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors . Debris was removed by centrifugation in a microfuge at 25 , 000 g for 10min at 4°C . For the immunodepletion experiment , brain lysates were sub - jected to three sequential rounds of immunoprecipitation with anti - p190 polyclonal serum . Transfection of neuroblastoma cells . Neuro - 2a cells ( ATCC no . CCL - 131 ) were grown in DMEM containing 10 % FBS . For transfection , cells were plated on glass coverslips in six - well plates , and transfected with 1 m g of DNA per well using Lipofectamine ( GibcoBRL ) . After 16h , transfected cells were identified by immunofluorescence as described 27 . We used the following expression plasmids : RcHA190 ( wild - type p190 ) , RcHAC3 ( C3 transferase ) , RcHA30 - 1 ( RhoGAP - deficient p190 ) , RcHARhoV14 ( activated RhoA ) , RcHA6 - 1 ( ref . 16 ; isolated p190 GTPase domain ) and RcHA ∆ R6 ( ref . 27 ; p190 lacking the GTPase domain ) .
