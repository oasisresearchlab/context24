In both cases , cell adhesion to ﬁbronectin leads to a rapid decrease in RhoA activity . However , (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 but not (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 supports high levels of RhoA activity at later stages of cell spreading , which are associated with a translocation of focal contacts to peripheral cell protrusions , recruitment of tensin into ﬁbrillar adhesions , and ﬁbronectin ﬁbrillogenesis . Expression of an activated mutant of RhoA stimulates (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 - mediated ﬁbrillogenesis . Despite the fact that (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 - mediated adhesion to the central W cell - binding domain of ﬁbronectin supports activation of RhoA , other regions of ﬁbronectin are required for the development of (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 - mediated but not (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 - mediated focal contacts . Using chimeras of (cid:3) 1 and (cid:3) 3 subunits , we ﬁnd that the extracellular domain of (cid:3) 1 controls RhoA activity . By expressing both (cid:3) 1 and (cid:3) 3 at high levels , we show that (cid:3) 1 - mediated control of the levels of (cid:3) 3 is important for the distribution of focal contacts . Our ﬁndings demonstrate that the pattern of ﬁbronectin receptors expressed on a cell dictates the ability of ﬁbronectin to stimulate RhoA - mediated organization of cell matrix adhesions . Introduction Cell adhesion is indispensable for embryonic development and tissue function and wound healing in the adult ( Hynes and Zhao , 2000 ) . Adhesive connections between cells are essential for the maintenance of tissue integrity and polarity and occur in three distinct structures termed adherens junctions , desmosomes , and tight junctions ( Gumbiner , 1996 ) . In adherens junctions , the homophilic interaction of clustered cadherins connects cells with each other , and probably via their connection with the cytoskeleton , cadherins can act as signaling molecules ( Vleminckx and Kemler , 1999 ) . An analogous process but with different players takes place in the adhesive contacts between cells and the ECM . In cell matrix adhesions , clustered integrins ( each made up of a noncovalently linked (cid:2) and (cid:3) subunit ) bind to ECM components via their globular head domains and connect to the actin cytoskeleton via adaptor proteins that bind their short cytoplasmic tails ( van der Flier and Sonnenberg , 2001 ; Hynes , 2002 ) . Cell matrix adhesions also act as signaling units by their capacity to organize the actin cytoskeleton and to accumulate various signaling intermediates ( Geiger et al . , 2001 ) . It has been reported that integrin - mediated cell adhesion can inhibit the formation of adherens junctions ( Monier - Gavelle and Duband , 1997 ; Weaver et al . , 1997 ; Gimond et al . , 1999 ; von Schlippe et al . , 2000 ) . However , the mechanism by which they do so remains poorly understood . One potential explanation may be the fact that the formation and mainte - nance of adherens junctions are regulated by small GTPases of the Rho family ( Fukata and Kaibuchi , 2001 ) and that integrins modulate the activity and localization of Rho – GTPases and their effector proteins ( Schwartz and Shattil , 2000 ) . Rho – GTPases cycle between an inactive , GDP - bound state and an active , GTP - bound state . In the latter , they are able to bind and activate a variety of effector proteins which modulate the organization of the actin cytoskeleton ( Hall and Nobes , 2000 ) . Although integrin - mediated adhesion regulates the actions of Rho – GTPases , which in turn affect cell – cell adhesion , the converse process can also take place : the activity of Rho – GTPases can be modulated by cadherins in adherens junctions ( Fukata and Kaibuchi , 2001 ) , and in turn Rho – GTPases regulate the actin cytoskeletal dynamics which govern Address correspondence to Arnoud Sonnenberg , Div . of Cell Biology , The Netherlands Cancer Institute , Plesmanlaan 121 , 1066 CX Amsterdam , Netherlands .

Cdc42 and Rac1 stimulate the formation of small cell matrix adhesions termed “focal complexes” asso - ciated with filopodia ( in the case of Cdc42 ) or lamellipodia ( in the case of Rac1 ) ( Nobes and Hall , 1995 ) . On the other hand , RhoA is implicated in the formation of actin stress fi - bers and the maturation of cell matrix adhesions to large junctional complexes termed “focal contacts” ( Ridley and Hall , 1992 ; Rottner et al . , 1999 ) . Besides mediating adhesion to ECM components , integrins participate in the assembly of an ECM . For instance , the as - sembly of a fibronectin matrix , an essential structure for cell migration during embryogenesis and wound healing ( Hynes , 1990 ; George et al . , 1993 ) , requires integrins ( Mosher , 1995 ; Schwarzbauer and Sechler , 1999 ) , although other noninte - grin receptors are probably equally important ( Woods , 2001 ) . Of the integrins , (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 is the typical fibronectin receptor in - volved in matrix assembly ( Wu et al . , 1993 ; Zhang et al . , 1993 ) , but other integrins can compensate to some extent for its absence ( Wennerberg et al . , 1996 ; Yang and Hynes , 1996 ) . Integrin affinity can be regulated , and it has turned out that the ability of (cid:3) 3 integrins to mediate fibronectin ma - trix assembly depends on their affinity state ( Wu et al . , 1995 , 1996 ) . Regardless of the integrin involved , its connection to the actin cytoskeleton is crucial for fibronectin fibrillogenesis . Fibronectin fibrils coalign with actin stress fibers ( Heggeness et al . , 1978 ; Hynes and Destree , 1978 ) , and F - actin – disrupt - ing agents or inhibition of RhoA prevent matrix assembly ( Christopher et al . , 1997 ; Zhang et al . , 1997 ; Zhong et al . , 1998 ) . RhoA - mediated contractility may generate the tension required for the exposure of self - assembly sites within the first two type III repeats of fibronectin ( Hocking et al . , 1994 ; Zhong et al . , 1998 ; Sechler et al . , 2001 ) . Indeed , studies on fibronectin fibrillogenesis in live cells demonstrate consider - able stretching of fibronectin molecules and unfolding of their globular modules upon association with the cell surface ( Ohashi et al . , 1999 ; Baneyx et al . , 2001 ) . It is still unclear why (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 is such an efficient mediator of fibronectin fibrillogenesis compared with other integrins . Part of the explanation may lie in the fact that it binds fi - bronectin with high affinity . On the other hand , one might speculate that different fibronectin - binding integrins gener - ate different degrees of tension / contractility by their effect on the activity of RhoA or their association with the actin cytoskeleton . Fibronectin fibrillogenesis is accompanied by a specific translocation of (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 together with the cytoskeletal protein tensin from focal contacts into yet another type of cell matrix adhesions termed “fibrillar adhesions” ( Pankov et al . , 2000 ; Zamir et al . , 2000 ) . This process may be of critical importance for the assembly of a fibronectin matrix , since a fragment of tensin was found to inhibit both the transloca - tion of (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 and fibronectin fibrillogenesis without an ef - fect on focal contacts ( Pankov et al . , 2000 ) . Thus , the spe - cific association of (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 with tensin may partly explain the efficiency with which this integrin supports fibrillogenesis . In the current study , we have used two independently generated (cid:3) 1 integrin – deficient cell lines in which we ectop - ically expressed (cid:3) 1 or increased the expression of (cid:3) 3 . We es - tablished that these cell lines bind to fibronectin via (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 or via (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 , respectively . We then used these cell lines to in - vestigate the role of (cid:3) 1 and (cid:3) 3 integrins in the regulation of ( a ) cell – cell adhesion , ( b ) the activity of Rho – GTPases , ( c ) the development of the various types of cell matrix adhe - sions , and ( d ) fibronectin matrix assembly . Results Increased levels of (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 induce spreading and scattering but do not stimulate GTP loading on RhoA in (cid:3) 1 - deficient cells Expression of (cid:3) 1 causes the disruption of cell – cell junctions in (cid:3) 1 - deficient GD25 fibroblastoid cells and induces a mor - phological epithelial - mesenchymal – like transition in (cid:3) 1 - defi - cient GE11 epithelioid cells ( Gimond et al . , 1999 ) . To inves - tigate if this effect is specific for (cid:3) 1 integrins , we generated GD25 and GE11 cells with increased surface expression levels of the integrin (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 ( GD (cid:3) 3 and GE (cid:3) 3 , respectively ) . At - tempts to generate such a cell line by ectopic expression of the (cid:2) v subunit were unsuccessful ( unpublished data ) , suggesting that the amount of the (cid:3) 3 subunit was limiting . Indeed , ec - topic expression of (cid:3) 3 resulted in increased surface expression of (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 in these cells ( see Fig . 2 ) . The morphology of the GD (cid:3) 3 and GE (cid:3) 3 cells resembled that of GD (cid:3) 1 and GE (cid:3) 1 cells ; cell – cell contacts were disrupted and spreading was en - hanced compared with the parental cells ( Fig . 1 A ) . Notably , GE (cid:3) 3 cells ( and to a lesser extent GD (cid:3) 3 cells ) were consider - ably more spread than the (cid:3) 1 - expressing cells ( cell height at a distance of 4 (cid:4) m from the nucleus was 6 . 7 (cid:5) 0 . 72 for GE11 , 4 . 03 (cid:5) 0 . 45 for GE (cid:3) 1 , and 2 . 36 (cid:5) 0 . 23 for GE (cid:3) 3 cells ) . GD25 cells contain very small vinculin - containing cell matrix adhesions , and vinculin and F - actin are localized at the borders of epithelial islands in GE11 cells . Expression of (cid:3) 1 integrins leads to increased formation of F - actin stress fi - bers and cell matrix adhesions in both cell types ( Fig . 1 B ) ( Wennerberg et al . , 1996 ; Gimond et al . , 1999 ) . Similar to the effect of (cid:3) 1 expression , increased size and numbers of vinculin - positive cell matrix adhesions were observed in GD (cid:3) 3 and GE (cid:3) 3 cells ( Fig . 1 B ) . However , in contrast to the localization of cell matrix adhesions in cell protrusions of (cid:3) 1 - expressing cells they were more randomly distributed over the entire basal surface of the GD (cid:3) 3 and GE (cid:3) 3 cells . We have reported previously that RhoA activity is in - creased after (cid:3) 1 expression in GD25 or GE11 cells ( Gi - mond et al . , 1999 ) . However , it remained unclear if RhoA activity is induced by (cid:3) 1 integrins and required for the dis - ruption of cell – cell junctions or if RhoA is activated as a consequence of the loss of cell – cell adhesion . Therefore , we tested if the scattered phenotype caused by increased levels of (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 is also accompanied by increased RhoA activity . A strong increase in RhoA – GTP levels was indeed observed upon expression of (cid:3) 1 but in marked contrast , GTP - bound RhoA was barely detectable in GD (cid:3) 3 and GE (cid:3) 3 cells ( Fig . 1 C ) . GTP loading on Rac1 was only weakly affected by the expression of either (cid:3) 1 or the increased expression of (cid:3) 3 ; a small increase in Rac1 activity was consistently detected in GD (cid:3) 1 cells , whereas the levels of GTP - bound Rac1 in GE11 , GE (cid:3) 1 , and GE (cid:3) 3 cells were similar . Thus , similar to the expression of (cid:3) 1 , increased levels of (cid:3) 3 integrins induce scattering of (cid:3) 1 - deficient cells , but only (cid:3) 1 integrins stimu - Regulation of matrix adhesion by (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 and (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 | Danen et al . 1073 late high levels of RhoA activity and the organization of fo - cal contacts in cell protrusions . Expression of fibronectin receptors and adhesion to fibronectin by (cid:3) 1 - versus (cid:3) 3 - transduced cells To be able to use these cell lines for a comparative study of (cid:3) 1 and (cid:3) 3 integrin – mediated responses to fibronectin , we analyzed their expression profiles of fibronectin - binding in - tegrins and their adhesiveness to fibronectin . GD (cid:3) 3 ( un - published data ) and GE (cid:3) 3 cells strongly expressed (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 ( Fig . 2 , A , hu (cid:3) 3 , and B , left panel ) . High surface expression of the (cid:2) 5 subunit of the (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 fibronectin - binding integrin was induced in GD (cid:3) 1 ( unpublished data ) and GE (cid:3) 1 cells ( Fig . 2 A , mo (cid:2) 5 ) , but (cid:2) v expression levels were also in - creased ( Fig . 2 A , mo (cid:2) v ) . As reported for GD (cid:3) 1 cells ( Retta et al . , 2001 ) , we observed that (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 levels were sup - pressed in GE (cid:3) 1 cells ( Fig . 2 , A , mo (cid:3) 3 , and B , left panel ) . Immunoprecipitations with anti - (cid:2) v , - (cid:3) 1 , and - (cid:3) 5 antibod - ies demonstrated that the (cid:2) v (cid:3) 1 vitronectin / fibronectin re - ceptor and the (cid:2) v (cid:3) 5 vitronectin receptor are expressed on GE (cid:3) 1 cells ( Fig . 2 B , right panel ) . No (cid:2) v (cid:3) 6 was detected ( unpublished data ) . Thus , (cid:3) 1 - transduced cells may use Figure 1 .

GD25 cells poorly adhered to fibronectin , but the expres - sion of (cid:3) 1 integrins or the increased expression of (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 in - duced a similar increase in adhesion to fibronectin ( Fig . 2 C ) . Likewise , GE (cid:3) 1 and GE (cid:3) 3 cells adhered better to fi - bronectin than the parental GE11 cells . At a concentration of 1 (cid:4) g / ml fibronectin , (cid:2) 30 % of the GE (cid:3) 1 and GE (cid:3) 3 cells but only 15 % of the GE11 cells had adhered ( Fig . 2 C , asterisks , and insert ) . Cell adhesion to fibronectin of non - transduced and (cid:3) 3 - transduced GD25 and GE11 cells was blocked by a GRGDSP peptide ( but not by a GRGESP con - trol ) , whereas adhesion of (cid:3) 1 - transduced cells was only poorly sensitive to inhibition by RGD ( Fig . 2 C ) but could be completely blocked by the anti – mouse (cid:2) 5 antibody , BMA5 ( unpublished data ) . This is in line with the fact that binding of (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 occurs exclusively via the RGD site in the central cell - binding domain ( CCBD ) * of fibronectin , whereas (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 binds the RGD and the synergy region ( Aota et al . , 1994 ; Bowditch et al . , 1994 ; Danen et al . , 1995 ) . The surprisingly strong adhesion of parental GE11 but not GD25 cells to fibronectin was completely blocked by the RGD peptide , suggesting that endogenous (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 was re - sponsible . In line with this , we observed that the expression of (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 on GE11 cells was stronger than that on GD25 cells ( Fig . 2 D ) . Figure 2 .

Bars , 5 (cid:4) m . In conclusion , (cid:3) 1 - transduced cells express the (cid:2) v (cid:3) 1 and (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 fibronectin receptors and predominantly use (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 for adhesion to fibronectin , whereas (cid:3) 3 - transduced cells use (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 , but the efficiency of adhesion to fibronectin of both cell types is similar . Integrin (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 - but not (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 - mediated adhesion to fibronectin stimulates RhoA – GTP loading and localization of focal contacts in cellular protrusions Having established that (cid:3) 1 - and (cid:3) 3 - transduced cells adhere with similar efficiency to fibronectin , whereas only (cid:3) 1 inte - grins stimulate RhoA activity , we next examined the regula - tion of RhoA – GTP loading during spreading of these cells on fibronectin . In line with the findings in cells grown in standard medium ( Fig . 1 C ) , Rac1 GTP levels were similar in (cid:3) 1 - or (cid:3) 3 - transduced cells spreading on fibronectin un - der serum - free conditions ( unpublished data ) . In GE (cid:3) 1 cells , RhoA – GTP levels were high in suspension , low at ini - tial adhesion ( t (cid:6) 10 min ) , but strongly increased at later time points after adhesion ( t (cid:6) 30 min ) followed by a grad - ual decrease during further cell spreading ( Fig . 3 A ) . A simi - lar pattern , albeit with somewhat slower kinetics , was seen with GD (cid:3) 1 cells ( see Fig . 6 B ) . High levels of GTP - bound RhoA that disappeared during the early stages of cell adhe - sion were also observed in suspended GE (cid:3) 3 ( Fig . 3 A ) and GD (cid:3) 3 cells ( unpublished data ) , but the increase in RhoA – 1076 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 159 , Number 6 , 2002 GTP loading during later stages of cell spreading ( t (cid:6) 30 and 90 min ) was not observed in these cells . To study the development and distribution of cell matrix adhesions in response to adhesion to fibronectin via (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 or (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 , spreading assays were performed on fibronectin - coated coverslips in the absence of serum in order to rule out any effect of vitronectin , a serum component that binds (cid:2) v integrins . Since the exaggerated cell spreading and random distribution of cell matrix adhesions was most prominent in GE (cid:3) 3 cells ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) , we compared GE (cid:3) 1 and GE (cid:3) 3 cells in these assays . In spreading GE11 cells , a corti - cal ring of F - actin was observed and cell matrix adhesions stained for paxillin were distributed along this ring ( Fig . 3 B ) . In GE (cid:3) 1 cells , focal contacts assembled between 10 and 30 min after (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 - mediated adhesion to fibronectin , the vast majority of which localized to peripheral cell protru - sions that were connected by long F - actin stress fibers . In contrast , F - actin and cell matrix adhesions initially became organized in a cortical ring in spreading GE (cid:3) 3 cells , but at later time points some GE (cid:3) 3 cells did develop large focal contacts that were distributed randomly over the basal cell surface and were connected by short F - actin cables ( Fig . 3 B , compare 60 min with 90 min and also * with * * in bottom right ; 27 (cid:5) 11 % of GE (cid:3) 3 cells showed random distribution of short F - actin cables and focal contacts rather than circular distribution at 90 min ) . Similarly , vinculin was clustered in focal contacts that localized in cell protrusions of GE (cid:3) 1 cells , whereas it was detected in randomly distributed focal contacts in GE (cid:3) 3 cells ( Fig . 3 C ) . Intriguingly , staining for the autophosphorylated ( active ) form of FAK revealed a par - tial colocalization with vinculin in both cell lines , but it was also detected at the tips of cell protrusions of GE (cid:3) 1 cells . Fi - nally , talin was found together with vinculin in the adhe - sions present in (cid:3) 1 - and (cid:3) 3 - transduced cells ( unpublished data ) . From these findings we conclude that (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 - but not (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 - mediated adhesion to fibronectin stimulates RhoA – GTP loading and the distribution of focal contacts in pe - ripheral cell protrusions . Altered localization of tensin and impaired fibronectin fibrillogenesis in GD (cid:3) 3 and GE (cid:3) 3 cells that can be partially rescued by activated RhoA In analogy with the complete rescue of cell adhesion to fi - bronectin by the increased expression of (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 in (cid:3) 1 - defi - cient cells , low levels of fibronectin - binding integrins in gen - eral might also explain the inefficient fibronectin matrix assembly in (cid:3) 1 - deficient cells . Therefore , we assessed fi - bronectin matrix assembly in GD (cid:3) 3 and GE (cid:3) 3 cells . Our findings confirmed that expression of (cid:3) 1 induced the forma - tion of a dense meshwork of fibronectin fibrils in GD25 cells ( Wennerberg et al . , 1996 ) and showed a similar induction in GE (cid:3) 1 cells ( Fig . 4 A ) . However , despite similar adhesiveness of (cid:3) 3 - transduced cells to immobilized fibronectin increased levels of (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 did not stimulate fibronectin fibrillogenesis . In confluent cultures of GD25 , GE11 , GD (cid:3) 3 , and GE (cid:3) 3 cells , some short fibronectin fibrils could be seen , but fibril - logenesis was minimal compared with that in GD (cid:3) 1 and GE (cid:3) 1 cells ( unpublished data ) . Similarly , (cid:3) 1 - expressing cells effectively incorporated exogenous biotinylated fibro - nectin into a matrix , whereas cells expressing (cid:3) 3 at high lev - els did not ( unpublished data ; see Fig . 8 , B and C ) . Since the inability of (cid:3) 3 - transduced GD25 and GE11 cells to assemble a fibronectin matrix correlated with their inability to activate RhoA , we wondered if expression of a dominant active mutant of RhoA could induce fibronectin fibrillogenesis in GE (cid:3) 3 cells . Therefore , we transiently ex - pressed V14RhoA in GE (cid:3) 3 cells and observed that the for - mation of many short fibronectin fibrils ( (cid:7) 5 (cid:4) m ) was stim - ulated , but it did not result in the assembly of a matrix comparable to that produced by GE (cid:3) 1 cells ( Fig . 4 B , top right ) . We next tested if the inability of high levels of (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 to induce efficient fibronectin matrix assembly could be res - cued by the addition of an activating anti - (cid:3) 3 antibody as has been reported for (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 in CHO cells ( Wu et al . , 1996 ) . Treatment of GE (cid:3) 3 cells with LIBS6 weakly stimulated the assembly of exogenously added fibronectin into thin short fibrils along the periphery of the cells ( Fig . 4 B , bottom left ) . Figure 3 ( continued from previous page ) Regulation of matrix adhesion by (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 and (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 | Danen et al . 1077 When V14RhoA - expressing GE (cid:3) 3 cells were treated with LIBS6 , the formation of long fibrils ( 10 – 20 (cid:4) m ) was ob - served , similar to those observed in GE (cid:3) 1 cells although their number was small ( Fig . 4 B , bottom right ) . The cytoskeletal protein tensin colocalizes with (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 but not (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 in the fibrillar adhesions associated with fibronectin fibrillogenesis ( Pankov et al . , 2000 ; Zamir et al . , 2000 ) . To investigate where tensin resides in cells lacking (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 , we investigated tensin localization in (cid:3) 1 - and (cid:3) 3 - transduced GD25 and GE11 cells . Since we were unable to detect endog - enous mouse tensin , we transiently expressed GFP - tensin in these cells . GFP - tensin was localized in fibrillar adhesions , ( where vinculin was not concentrated ) at the basal and apical surface of GD (cid:3) 1 cells but not of GD (cid:3) 3 cells ( Fig . 5 A ) . In GD (cid:3) 3 cells , tensin colocalized with vinculin in focal contacts . As a control , GFP - vinculin was localized in focal contacts in both GD (cid:3) 1 and GD (cid:3) 3 cells ( unpublished data ) . Identical findings were obtained for tensin and vinculin localization in GE11 cells transduced with (cid:3) 1 or (cid:3) 3 ( unpublished data ) . Furthermore , we observed colocalization of tensin with exog - enously added biotinylated fibronectin in fibrillar adhesions in GE (cid:3) 1 cells in confluent and subconfluent cultures , whereas tensin was localized in focal contacts of GE (cid:3) 3 cells where biotinylated fibronectin was not detected ( Fig . 5 B ) . Thus , in line with the requirement of RhoA for fibronec - tin matrix assembly increased expression of (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 , which does not stimulate RhoA activity , does not support this process . Expression of dominant active RhoA or activating anti - (cid:3) 3 antibodies can both stimulate the initial steps of (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 - mediated fibronectin fibril formation . However , in combination they induce long fibronectin fibrils , indistin - guishable from those induced by (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 , though the process is inefficient . Moreover , under conditions in which RhoA activity is undetectable ( GD (cid:3) 3 and GE (cid:3) 3 cells ) tensin - con - taining fibrillar adhesions fail to form . Instead , tensin is colocalized with vinculin in focal contacts that are randomly distributed over the basal surface . Other regions besides the CCBD in fibronectin regulate cell matrix adhesions in (cid:3) 1 - but not (cid:3) 3 - transduced cells Despite their low levels of RhoA activity , GD (cid:3) 3 and GE (cid:3) 3 cells did generate focal contacts ( even though their distribu - tion was different from that in (cid:3) 1 - expressing cells ) . Besides the interactions with the CCBD in fibronectin , other re - gions in the fibronectin molecule can stimulate the forma - tion of focal contacts and F - actin stress fibers ( Woods , 2001 ) . We analyzed the formation of cell matrix adhesions in cells adhering via (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 or (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 to a 120 - kD chymotryp - tic fragment of fibronectin that contains the CCBD . Under these conditions , GD (cid:3) 1 and to a lesser extent GE (cid:3) 1 cells displayed few small cell matrix adhesions with most of the paxillin being localized diffusely in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 6 A ) . Formation of focal contacts in GD (cid:3) 1 cells could be stimu - lated by the addition of a fibronectin type 3 repeat ( II - IFN ) 12 - 15 (cid:8) V GST fusion protein , which contains the HepII domain that has been reported to stimulate RhoA - dependent processes ( Woods , 2001 ) . In complete contrast , the formation of focal contacts in cells binding to the 120 - kD fragment through (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 was indistinguishable from that seen on fibronectin ( Fig . 6 A ) . The inability of (cid:3) 1 - transduced cells to assemble focal con - tacts on the 120 - kD fibronectin fragment may be due to in - Figure 4 .

Therefore , we compared the regulation of RhoA – GTP levels in (cid:3) 1 - expressing cells spreading on fibronectin and on the CCBD only . RhoA – GTP levels were high in sus - pension and were suppressed during the early stages of spreading ( 10 and 30 min ) on fibronectin or the 120 - kD chymotryptic fragment ( Fig . 6 B ) . However , RhoA – GTP levels were transiently stimulated at later time points , e . g . , 60 min ( unpublished data ) and 90 min ( Fig . 6 B ) , on both substrates . Similar results but with somewhat faster kinetics were obtained with GE (cid:3) 1 cells ( unpublished data ) . Treat - ment of the cells with cyclohexamide ruled out that synthe - sis and deposition of cellular fibronectin was responsible for the activation of RhoA on 120 - kD coated surfaces . These findings demonstrate that , although RhoA – GTP loading can be supported by the CCBD , fibronectin - stimu - lated focal contact formation in cells binding through (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 requires interactions with domains of fibronectin other than the CCBD , such as the HepII domain , whereas the focal contacts in cells binding through (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 can be stimulated by the CCBD exclusively . Low levels of GTP - bound RhoA in (cid:3) 3 - transduced cells cannot be explained by increased activity of FAK or p190RhoGAP Although the results above clearly showed that focal contacts in the (cid:3) 1 - deficient cells are formed in the absence of high levels of RhoA activity , the reason for the impaired RhoA ac - Figure 5 .

Therefore , we exam - ined the two pathways that have been reported to play an important role in integrin - mediated suppression of RhoA – GTP levels , namely FAK ( Ren et al . , 2000 ) and p190Rho GTPase - activating protein ( GAP ) ( Arthur et al . , 2000 ) . FAK became rapidly phosphorylated on its major autophos - phorylation site , Tyr 397 , after adhesion to fibronectin in GE (cid:3) 1 cells , whereas the response was somewhat delayed in GE (cid:3) 3 cells ( Fig . 7 ) . This delay appeared to be specific , since adhesion - induced phosphorylation of p130Cas occurred with similar kinetics in GE (cid:3) 1 and GE (cid:3) 3 cells . Tyrosine phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP was similar in GE (cid:3) 1 and GE (cid:3) 3 cells spreading on fibronectin and gradually increased with time . Thus , tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and p190RhoGAP , which correlates with the activity of these proteins , is not increased or more sustained in (cid:3) 3 - trans - duced cells , demonstrating that a failure to inactivate these pathways does not explain the low level of GTP - bound RhoA in the (cid:3) 3 - transduced cells . The extracellular region of the (cid:3) subunit determines RhoA – GTP loading , fibronectin matrix assembly , and tensin recruitment One possible explanation for the specific stimulation of RhoA activity and RhoA - dependent processes , such as fi - bronectin matrix assembly by (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 , is that specific amino acids in the (cid:3) 1 cytoplasmic domain can recruit specific sig - naling intermediates , e . g . , tensin , which ultimately leads to RhoA activation . To test this idea , we expressed a chimeric (cid:3) Figure 6 . Roles of fibronectin regions other than the CCBD in (cid:3) 1 - and (cid:3) 3 - mediated regulation of cell matrix adhesions and RhoA – GTP loading .

The level of expression of this chi - mera was comparable to that of control wild - type (cid:3) 1 , it was accompanied by a similar strong expression of (cid:2) 5 , and the cells adopted a scattered morphology that resembled that of wild - type (cid:3) 1 - expressing cells ( unpublished data ) . When we measured RhoA activity in these cells , similar amounts of GTP - bound RhoA were observed in (cid:3) 1 ex (cid:3) 3 in - and (cid:3) 1 - expressing cells ( Fig . 8 A ) . We next examined the ability of this chimera to stimulate the assembly of a fibronectin matrix . In line with the levels of GTP - bound RhoA in these cells , the extent of fibril for - mation observed in GE (cid:3) 1 ex (cid:3) 3 in was similar to that in GD (cid:3) 1 ( Fig . 8 , B and C ) . In addition , matrix assembly of (cid:3) 1 - ( un - published data ) and that of (cid:3) 1 ex (cid:3) 3 in - expressing cells was completely blocked by BMA5 blocking anti – mouse (cid:2) 5 anti - body ( Fig . 8 B ) , indicating that the chimeric (cid:3) subunit bound fibronectin as a functional (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 ex (cid:3) 3 in heterodimer . We also tested if the formation of tensin - containing fibrillar adhesions was affected by the replacement of the (cid:3) 1 cyto - plasmic tail , and again we observed no effect ; tensin effi - ciently localized to fibrillar adhesions at the apical surface of GD (cid:3) 1 ex (cid:3) 3 in cells where biotinylated fibronectin was incor - porated into fibrils ( Fig . 8 D ) . Finally , we expressed an in - verse chimeric integrin (cid:3) subunit , (cid:3) 3 ex (cid:3) 1 in , in GD25 and GE11 cells and observed that it behaved similar to (cid:3) 3 with respect to RhoA activation and fibronectin matrix assembly ( unpublished data ) . 1080 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 159 , Number 6 , 2002 Together , these findings demonstrate that the stimulation of RhoA activity , organization of focal contacts in cell pro - trusions , fibronectin matrix assembly , and formation of tensin - containing fibrillar adhesions is dictated by the extra - cellular region of the (cid:3) subunit . High levels of expression of both (cid:3) 1 and (cid:3) 3 leads to an intermediate phenotype Given the suppression of (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 levels in (cid:3) 1 - transduced GD25 ( Retta et al . , 2001 ) and GE11 cells ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) , the enhanced RhoA activation that we observed in these cells may also be due to a loss of inhibitory functions of (cid:3) 3 inte - grins . To test this , we ectopically expressed (cid:3) 3 in GE (cid:3) 1 cells ( GE [ (cid:3) 1 (cid:9)(cid:3) 3 ] ) , and , vice versa , (cid:3) 1 was expressed in GE (cid:3) 3 cells ( GE [ (cid:3) 3 (cid:9)(cid:3) 1 ] ) . The surface levels of the (cid:2) 5 , (cid:3) 1 , and (cid:3) 3 subunits were similar to those in cells transduced with a single subunit ( unpublished data ) . Importantly , RhoA – GTP loading in (cid:3) 1 - expressing cells was not inhibited by the in - creased expression of (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 ( Fig . 9 A ) . Despite the inability of (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 to suppress RhoA – GTP levels in (cid:3) 1 - expressing cells , the organization of focal con - tacts was altered . Compared with GE (cid:3) 1 cells , GE [ (cid:3) 1 (cid:9)(cid:3) 3 ] cells growing in standard culture medium were considerably more spread , a characteristic feature of GE (cid:3) 3 cells ( unpub - lished data ) . Moreover , spreading of GE [ (cid:3) 1 (cid:9)(cid:3) 3 ] cells on fibronectin under serum - free conditions led to an interme - diate phenotype . Some protrusions with focal contacts at their tips were still formed , but many cells showed a cortical organization of F - actin , and most protrusions ended in membrane blebs ( Fig . 9 B ) . Moreover , despite the stimula - tion of RhoA – GTP loading in GE [ (cid:3) 3 (cid:9)(cid:3) 1 ] cells , they re - tained the typical pancake - like spread phenotype of GE (cid:3) 3 cells with part of the cells showing the protrusions ending in membrane blebs as described above ( unpublished data ) . Finally , since the ectopic expression of (cid:3) 3 in GE (cid:3) 1 cells only minimally affected overall RhoA – GTP levels and mor - phology but did affect the organization of cell matrix adhe - sions locally at the ends of the protrusions , we wondered if the membrane blebs were formed due to high concentra - tions of (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 integrins , which we found is associated with Rac1 but not RhoA activity . Indeed , many small paxillin - containing cell matrix adhesions were localized at those sites , and these adhesions contained large amounts of (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 ( Fig . 9 B , right panel ) . These findings demonstrate that the ability of (cid:3) 1 inte - grins to regulate (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 levels is an important aspect of their role in the distribution / maturation of cell matrix adhesions , but it is not involved in the stimulation of overall RhoA – GTP loading by (cid:3) 1 . Discussion The ECM regulates many cellular functions mainly via sig - naling by integrins ( Giancotti , 2000 ; Danen and Yamada , 2001 ; Schwartz , 2001 ) . To study the role of the (cid:3) 1 inte - grins in ECM signaling , cell lines have been generated that lack the (cid:3) 1 subunit common to this subfamily ( Fässler and Meyer , 1995 ; Gimond et al . , 1999 ) . These cells show im - paired adhesion , migration , and matrix assembly on fi - bronectin ( Wennerberg et al . , 1996 ; Gimond et al . , 1999 ) . Notably , the (cid:3) 1 - deficient cells do express low levels of (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 , an integrin that can bind fibronectin and that might be expected to compensate for the lack of (cid:3) 1 as far as inter - actions with fibronectin are concerned . In the current study , we increased the level of (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 surface expression in the independently generated GD25 fibroblastoid and GE11 epithelioid (cid:3) 1 - deficient cell lines and tested if this results in similar changes as observed after the induction of (cid:3) 1 expression . We find that increased expression of (cid:3) 3 - in (cid:3) 1 - deficient cells causes the disruption of cell – cell con - tacts , but unlike the expression of (cid:3) 1 in these cells this pro - cess is not accompanied by an increased activity of the small GTPase , RhoA . We propose the following model for integrin - mediated control of the development and organization of cell matrix adhesions : during the initial stages of cell spreading on fi - bronectin when RhoA activity is low , focal complexes are formed that gradually increase in size and convert to focal contacts ( Ridley and Hall , 1992 ; Rottner et al . , 1999 ) . This early phase is efficiently stimulated by (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 - mediated binding to the CCBD , but it requires additional interac - tions in cells which bind via (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 . Subsequently , at later stages of cell spreading when the number of focal contacts containing (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 continues to increase randomly in the cell , focal contacts containing (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 disappear from the center while the new ones are formed at the tips of cell protru - sions . This latter process is accompanied by an increase in RhoA - mediated tension , which is necessary for the forma - Figure 7 .

Regulation of Rho – GTPase activity in cells expressing (cid:3) 1 or (cid:3) 3 integrins Besides regulation by soluble factors , the activity and the lo - calization of Rho – GTPases and their effector proteins is in - fluenced by cell – cell and cell – ECM adhesion ( Schwartz and Shattil , 2000 ; Fukata and Kaibuchi , 2001 ) . We found previ - ously that RhoA activity is barely detectable in (cid:3) 1 - deficient cell lines and is increased upon expression of (cid:3) 1 ( Gimond et al . , 1999 ) . However , since RhoA can be suppressed by cad - herin signaling ( Noren et al . , 2001 ) it was difficult to deter - mine if RhoA is implicated in (cid:3) 1 - induced scattering or if its activation is caused by the loss of cell – cell contacts . Since we now observe that RhoA activity is associated specifically with (cid:3) 1 expression , whereas both (cid:3) 1 - and (cid:3) 3 - transduced cells are scattered , we conclude that (cid:3) 1 integrins specifically support high levels of RhoA activity . Cell spreading upon attachment to fibronectin is accom - panied by activation of Cdc42 , which in turn activates Rac1 ( Price et al . , 1998 ) . Around the same time ( within 5 min af - ter attachment ) RhoA activity is down - regulated , a Src - dependent process that is probably important for relieving the tension that would otherwise interfere with the initial phase of cell spreading ( Ren et al . , 1999 ; Arthur et al . , 2000 ) . Sub - sequently , RhoA activity is increased and stimulates further cytoskeletal rearrangement after which GTP – RhoA levels gradually decrease again to reach a steady - state level of inter - mediate activity ( Barry et al . , 1997 ; Ren et al . , 1999 ) . We observed previously that among different ECM proteins fi - bronectin is particularly efficient in the stimulation of these RhoA - dependent processes ( Danen et al . , 2000 ) . Our cur - rent findings demonstrate that the pattern of fibronectin re - ceptors expressed by a cell dramatically affects the activation of RhoA and as a consequence the ability of cells to organize their cell matrix adhesions . Both p190RhoGAP and FAK have been implicated in the suppression of RhoA activity in the early phase of inte - grin - mediated spreading ( Arthur et al . , 2000 ; Ren et al . , 2000 ) . Our observation that tyrosine phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP and FAK is not stronger or more sustained in cells adhering to fibronectin via (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 compared with cells adhering via (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 suggests that suppression by these path - ways cannot explain the low levels of GTP – RhoA in the (cid:3) 3 - transduced cells . Parenthetically , there is evidence for the converse process , control of phosphorylation of FAK by the Figure 8 .

This in turn might cause the turnover rate of focal contacts to be low , which ex - plains why so many focal contacts are randomly distributed in the cell . This exlpanation is supported by the fact that also in FAK knockout fibroblasts , the turnover of focal contacts is impaired ( Ilic et al . , 1995 ) . Alternative mechanisms that could explain the specific activation of RhoA by (cid:3) 1 integrins may involve the FAK - associated GAP for RhoA , Graf ( Tay - lor et al . , 1998 , 1999 ) , or the activation of specific guanine exchange factors , although at this moment to our knowledge no guanine exchange factor for RhoA has been shown to be affected by integrin - mediated adhesion . The finding that swapping of the (cid:3) 1 and (cid:3) 3 cytoplasmic tails affects neither RhoA activity nor the downstream func - tional effects argues against a model in which specific combi - nations of amino acids that bind specific signaling interme - diates ( e . g . , tensin ) are present in the cytoplasmic domain of the (cid:3) 1 but not of the (cid:3) 3 subunit . An alternative explanation is that specific (cid:2) subunits are involved , i . e . , (cid:2) 5 but not (cid:2) v may stimulate RhoA activity . Cross - talk between integrins and other receptors has been demonstrated , and differential modulation by (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 and (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 of other receptors that regu - late RhoA activity could also be involved . In this respect , the RhoA activity assays that were performed with cells growing in complete medium indicate that lysophosphatidic acid is unable to support high levels of GTP - bound RhoA in cells lacking (cid:3) 1 integrins , suggesting that (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 may support Edg receptor signaling . On the other hand , the results of RhoA activity assays with cells spreading on the CCBD in the ab - sence of serum demonstrate that the (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 - dependent RhoA activation on fibronectin does not depend on collaboration with cellular receptors that bind regions of fibronectin other than the CCBD , such as the HepII domain ( e . g . , syndecans ) ( Woods , 2001 ) . Nevertheless , in line with findings with mouse fibroblasts ( Saoncella et al . , 1999 ) we observe that such collaboration does regulate the formation of cell matrix adhesions in cells adhering via (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 . A recent study shows that overexpression of (cid:3) 3 in CHO cells is associated with increased RhoA activity , whereas overexpression of (cid:3) 1 is associated with Rac1 activity ( Miao et al . , 2002 ) . It is not mentioned in this report how the over - expression of one subunit affects the levels of the other inte - grins , and it is possible that cross - talk between (cid:3) 1 and (cid:3) 3 integrins occurs in the CHO cells that express both inte - grins . Nevertheless , these findings suggest major differences in the regulation of Rho – GTPases between CHO cells and the two cell lines used in our study . On the other hand , in complete agreement with our finding that Rac1 activity is similar in (cid:3) 1 - and (cid:3) 3 - expressing cells , others have reported recently that (cid:2) IIb (cid:3) 3 - mediated adhesion of CHO cells and clustering of IL2R chimeras of either (cid:3) 1 or (cid:3) 3 cytoplasmic tails in fibroblasts stimulates Rac1 activity ( Berrier et al . , 2002 ) . A major complicating factor in comparing the results of various studies is the difference in possibilities for cross - talk between the integrins and other receptors , such as Edg receptors , syndecans , or cadherins , in the different cell types . What is the nature of the cell matrix adhesions in GD (cid:3) 3 and GE (cid:3) 3 cells ? Even though (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 - and (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 - mediated cell matrix adhe - sions are formed when RhoA activity is low ( RhoA activity is stimulated (cid:2) 30 min in GE (cid:3) 1 and somewhat later in GD (cid:3) 1 cells , whereas cell matrix adhesions begin to form as early as 10 min after cell adhesion ) , they both are sensitive to inhibi - tion with the Y - 27632 Rho kinase inhibitor ( unpublished data ) . However , the fact that (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 - mediated focal contacts are stimulated by the CCBD , whereas (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 - mediated focal contacts require additional stimuli suggests that they de - velop by different mechanisms . Probably due to the absence of increased RhoA activity during later stages of cell spread - ing in (cid:3) 1 - deficient cells , the (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 - mediated focal contacts remain randomly distributed instead of translocating to the tips of cell protrusions and giving rise to fibrillar adhesions as is the case with (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 - mediated focal contacts . Integrins are indirectly connected with the actin cytoskel - eton via scaffolding proteins such as vinculin , paxillin , and tensin that cluster with integrins in cell matrix adhesions ( Geiger et al . , 2001 ) . In two - dimensional in vitro culture systems , segregation of components of cell matrix adhesions gives rise to focal contacts and fibrillar adhesions of which the latter are specifically enriched in the integrin (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 and tensin ( Pankov et al . , 2000 ; Zamir et al . , 2000 ) .

Regulation of matrix adhesion by (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 and (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 | Danen et al . 1083 shown recently that cells in vivo or in three - dimensional ma - trices in vitro contain cell matrix adhesions that combine as - pects of focal contacts and fibrillar adhesions ( Cukierman et al . , 2001 ) . Interestingly , the adhesions formed in GD (cid:3) 3 and GE (cid:3) 3 cells appear to mimic those three - dimensional adhe - sions to some extent : they contain vinculin , paxillin , and talin , and in addition they also retain tensin . The low level of GTP - bound RhoA observed in (cid:3) 1 - deficient cells plated on a two - dimensional surface and the weaker mechanical stretching of cells grown in a three - dimensional environ - ment may each result in a similar low level of tension , which apparently is insufficient for this translocation process . Fibronectin matrix assembly Besides mediating cell adhesion to ECM , integrins are also actively involved in the formation of the ECM , for example , in fibronectin matrix assembly ( Schwarzbauer and Sechler , 1999 ) . (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 is the typical integrin involved in fibronectin fibrillogenesis , but in mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking both (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 and another (cid:3) 1 integrin fibronectin receptor , (cid:2) 4 (cid:3) 1 , matrix assembly can occur and was shown to depend on (cid:2) v integrins ( Yang and Hynes , 1996 ) . By contrast , others have shown that a CHO cell line lacking (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 fails to pro - duce a fibronectin matrix despite the presence of (cid:2) v inte - grins ( Wu et al . , 1993 ; Zhang et al . , 1993 ) . Furthermore , in immortalized fibroblasts derived from (cid:3) 1 - null embryonic stem cells the fibronectin matrix is severely impaired with re - sidual assembly in highly confluent cultures that is mediated by the fibronectin / vitronectin receptor (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 and can be suppressed by vitronectin ( Wennerberg et al . , 1996 ; Sakai et al . , 1998a , b ; Zhang et al . , 1999 ) . Thus , the ability of other integrins , besides (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 , to mediate fibronectin matrix as - sembly depends on the cell type studied , which may be ex - plained by expression levels or activation state of the integrin involved . Indeed , (cid:2) IIb (cid:3) 3 and (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 can promote fibronec - tin matrix assembly in CHO cells provided that they are stimulated by activating mutations or by certain anti - (cid:3) 3 an - tibodies ( LIBS ) ( Wu et al . , 1995 , 1996 ) . We observe in GD (cid:3) 3 and GE (cid:3) 3 cells that high levels of (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 cannot support fibronectin matrix assembly , which is associated with the inability of these cells to support high levels of RhoA activity . Moreover , we report for the first time that expression of a dominant active mutant of RhoA , V14RhoA , can partially restore fibronectin fibrillogenesis in the absence of (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 . This strongly suggests that part of the explanation for the efficiency with which (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 supports matrix assembly lies in its ability to support high levels of RhoA activity . Inhibition of adherens junctions by integrin - mediated adhesion Rho – GTPases are critically involved in the regulation of ad - herens junctions ( Fukata and Kaibuchi , 2001 ) . In GD25 fi - broblastoid cells and GE11 epithelioid cells , desmosomes are absent and cell – cell contacts occur through adherens junc - tions ( Gimond et al . , 1999 ) . RhoA and Rac1 are both re - quired for the formation of adherens junctions ( Braga et al . , 1997 ) . However , we showed previously that Rac1 activity is also required for the (cid:3) 1 - induced disruption of adherens junctions ( Gimond et al . , 1999 ) . We now find that in cells in which RhoA activity is barely detectable ( (cid:3) 3 ) and in cells with high levels of GTP - bound RhoA ( (cid:3) 1 ) adherens junc - tions are disrupted . This demonstrates that in our experi - mental system integrin - mediated stimulation of high RhoA activity is not required for the induction of a scattered phe - notype . However , the morphological epithelial - mesenchy - mal – like transition observed in GE (cid:3) 3 cells is much less complete than that in GE (cid:3) 1 cells . Thus , RhoA activity may be required for the more complete switch in morphology from epithelioid to fibroblastoid . Control of (cid:3) 3 levels by (cid:3) 1 integrins We find that the ability of (cid:3) 1 integrins to regulate levels of (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 is crucial for the development of a complete fibroblas - toid phenotype . Thus , constitutive high levels of expression of (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 in GE (cid:3) 1 cells leads to a phenotype that appears to be intermediate between that of GE (cid:3) 1 and GE (cid:3) 3 cells with cellular protrusions ending in membrane blebs containing small cell matrix adhesions rather than pointed membrane protrusions with focal contacts . Since the level of (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 does not affect the overall RhoA – GTP levels in (cid:3) 1 - expressing cells , the inefficient formation of focal contacts in doubly transduced cells must be due to inhibition of RhoA effector pathways or to very local alterations in RhoA activity . De - creased activity of the RhoA – Rho kinase pathway and loss of stress fibers , focal contacts , and fibronectin matrix assembly is observed in many different types of transformed cells . In - triguingly , in these cells the expression of (cid:2) 5 (cid:3) 1 is almost in - variably switched to the expression of (cid:2) v (cid:3) 3 ( Plantefaber and Hynes , 1989 ; Giancotti and Ruoslahti , 1990 ) . Our finding , that these integrins differently regulate the activity of Rho – GTPases and their downstream functions may explain the dramatic morphological changes in tumor cells that undergo such a switch in integrin expression profile .

Plasmids The cDNA encoding the human integrin (cid:2) v subunit was digested from the pcDNA / (cid:2) v vector ( provided by Dr . David Cheresh ) as a BamHI - XbaI frag - ment and cloned into a biscistronic retroviral vector to create LZRS - (cid:2) v - IRES - zeo . LZRS - (cid:3) 1 - IRES - neo encoding the human integrin (cid:3) 1 subunit was described previously ( Gimond et al . , 1999 ) . The cDNA encoding the hu - man integrin (cid:3) 3 subunit was amplified from pcDNA / (cid:3) 3 ( Danen et al . , 1996 ) by PCR with Pwo DNA polymerase using a 5 (cid:10) primer containing a ClaI site followed by a Kozak sequence and a 3 (cid:10) primer containing a SnabI site and cloned into a bicistronic retroviral vector to create the LZRS - (cid:3) 3 - IRES - neo vector . For the generation of LZRS - (cid:3) 1 ex (cid:3) 3 in - IRES - neo encoding a (cid:3) 1 ex (cid:3) 3 in chimeric integrin subunit , the (cid:3) 3 cytoplasmic tail was amplified from pcDNA / (cid:3) 3 by PCR with Pwo DNA polymerase using a 5 (cid:10) primer in which the codons encoding Lysine 716 and Leucine 717 were mutated from aaa·ctc to aag·ctt , creating a HindIII site and a 3 (cid:10) primer containing a SnabI site .

Dominique Alfandari ( University of Virginia , Charlottesville , VA ) . All constructs were verified by DNA se - quence analysis . Cell culture , cDNA transfections , and retroviral transductions The GD25 and GE11 cell lines have been described previously : GD25 (cid:3) 1 - deficient fibroblastic cells were developed through in vitro differentiation of (cid:3) 1 knockout embryonic stem cells ( Fässler and Meyer , 1995 ) and GE11 (cid:3) 1 - deficient epithelioid cells were isolated from (cid:3) 1 chimeric embryos ( Gi - mond et al . , 1999 ) . Both cell lines were immortalized with SV - 40 large T transducing retrovirus and cultured in DME supplemented with 10 % FBS , penicillin , and streptomycin . cDNA transfections in GD25 and GE11 cells were done using the Ef - fectene kit from QIAGEN according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Ecotrophic Phoenix packaging cells ( Kinsella and Nolan , 1996 ) were trans - fected with amplification - deficient retroviral vectors using the calcium phosphate method to produce virus - containing culture supernatants . Sub - sequently , retroviral transductions were performed by culturing 10 5 cells for 8 h with 1 ml cell - free Phoenix supernatant in the presence of 10 (cid:4) g / ml DOTAP ( Boehringer ) . Cells were then maintained overnight in fresh me - dium . Transduced cells were sequentially bulk sorted three times by FACS ® for integrin surface expression . Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry For immunofluorescence , cells were fixed in 2 % PFA for 15 min and per - meabilized in 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 for 5 min with the exception of fibronec - tin matrix staining , which was performed on fixed but nonpermeabilized cells unless costaining of cytoskeletal components was performed . The coverslips were then blocked with 2 % BSA for 1 h and incubated with pri - mary antibodies for 1 h at RT . After washing with PBS , cells were incu - bated with FITC or TR - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Jackson Immu - noResearch Laboratories ) or with TR - conjugated phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) for 1 h at RT . Preparations were then washed in PBS , mounted in MOWIOL 4 - 88 solution supplemented with DABCO ( Calbiochem ) , and analyzed with a confocal Leica TCS NT microscope . For flow cytometry and cell sorting , cells were trypsinized , collected in culture medium , washed once with PBS , and incubated with primary anti - bodies in PBS containing 2 % serum for 1 h at 4 (cid:11) C . Cells were then washed in PBS , incubated with FITC - conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at 4 (cid:11) C , washed again , and analyzed on a FACScan ® or sorted on a FACStar plus ® ( Becton Dickinson ) . Adhesion assays Wells of 96 - well tissue culture plates were coated with various concentra - tions of fibronectin in PBS overnight at 4 (cid:11) C , blocked with 2 % heat - dena - tured BSA for 2 h at 37 (cid:11) C , and washed once with PBS . Asynchronously growing cells were trypsinized , collected in culture medium , washed once with PBS , resuspended in DME / 0 . 5 % BSA , and added to the wells at 2 (cid:12) 10 4 cells per well . After 20 min of incubation at 37 (cid:11) C , unattached cells were removed by rinsing of the plates with PBS , and the remaining at - tached cells were lysed and stained at 37 (cid:11) C overnight in 3 . 75 mM p - nitro - phenyl N - acetyl - (cid:3) - D - glucosamide / 0 . 05 M sodium citrate / 0 . 25 % Triton X - 100 . The OD 405 was determined in triplicate wells and related to the OD 405 measured in wells in which all 2 (cid:12) 10 4 cells were stained to calcu - late the percentage of adhered cells . Biotinylation , immunoprecipitation , and Western blot analysis For biotinylation of integrins at the cell surface , adherent cultures were se - rum starved for 30 min , washed with PBS , incubated with 0 . 5 mg / ml sulfo - NHS - biotin ( Pierce Chemical Co . ) in PBS for 30 min , and washed three times with PBS . For immunoprecipitation of biotinylated integrins , cells were lysed in Nonidet P - 40 lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 10 % glycerol , 10 mM MgCl 2 , supplemented with a protease inhibitor mix [ Sigma - Aldrich ] ) and for immunoprecipitation of FAK , p130Cas , and p190RhoGAP , cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 2 mM EDTA , 1 % sodium deoxycholate , 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 mM sodium orthovanadate , and a protease inhibitor mix [ Sigma - Aldrich ] ) . Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14 , 000 rpm for 20 min at 4 (cid:11) C . To remove nonspecific binding , clarified lysates were then incubated overnight at 4 (cid:11) C with con - trol IgG , and complexes were collected with 10 (cid:4) l GammaBind ( Amer - sham Biosciences ) . For immunoprecipitations , cleared lysates were incu - bated with 2 (cid:4) g / ml of the specific antibodies for 2 h at 4 (cid:11) C , and immune complexes were collected with 10 (cid:4) l GammaBind ( Amersham Bio - sciences ) , washed three times with lysis buffer , and solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer . Total cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS - PAGE , transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes ( Milli - pore ) , and analyzed by Western blotting followed by ECL using the Super - Signal system ( Pierce Chemical Co . ) . DOC insolubility assays Cells were plated on fibronectin - coated dishes in serum - free medium for 4 h and subsequently incubated for an additional 20 h in medium containing 10 % fibronectin - depleted serum and 10 (cid:4) g / ml biotinylated fibronectin . Af - ter washing with PBS , cells were lysed in DOC buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 5 , 1 % sodium deoxycholate [ DOC ] , 2 mM N - ethylmaleimide , 2 mM io - doacetic acid , 2 mM EDTA , 2 mM PMSF ) and passed five times through a 23 GA needle . DOC - insoluble material was collected by centrifugation at 14 , 000 rpm for 20 min at 4 (cid:11) C , washed once with DOC buffer , resolved by SDS - PAGE , transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes ( Millipore ) , and analyzed by Western blotting using HRPO - conjugated streptavidin . Biochemical assays for activity of Rho – GTPases Cells growing subconfluently in standard medium or cells that had been serum starved overnight and replated on fibronectin - coated dishes were lysed in 1 ml Nonidet P - 40 lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 10 % glycerol , 10 mM MgCl 2 , supplemented with a protease inhibitor mix [ Sigma - Aldrich ] ) , and lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14 , 000 rpm for 20 min at 4 (cid:11) C . A 1 % aliquot was removed for determination of total quantities of the GTPase being analyzed . Clari - fied lysates were then incubated for 45 min at 4 (cid:11) C with a GST fusion pro - tein of the Rho - binding domain of the Rho effector protein Rhotekin ( Ren et al . , 1999 ) or with a biotinylated peptide corresponding to the Cdc42 / Rac interactive binding motif in PAK1B ( provided by J . Collard ; some Rac assays were repeated with a GST fusion protein of the Rac - binding domain of PAK1B and gave identical results ) . Complexes were bound to glu - tathione - or streptavidin - conjugated beads , respectively , and washed three times in Nonidet P - 40 lysis buffer . The samples were analyzed by 14 % SDS - PAGE and Western blotting using RhoA and Rac1 antibodies to detect bound activated GTPases .
