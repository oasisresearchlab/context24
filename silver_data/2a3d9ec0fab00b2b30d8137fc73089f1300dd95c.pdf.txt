In this study , we show that the macroscopic network response of reconstituted actin networks can be traced back to the microscopic interaction poten - tial of an individual actin / ABP bond . The viscoelastic response of cross - linked actin networks is set by the cross - linker off - rate , the binding energy , and the characteristic bond length of individual actin / ABP interactions . INTRODUCTION Cells employ cross - linked and bundled actin networks to form an elastic cytoskeleton that can withstand mechanical load . Transient cross - links guarantee structural and mechanical adaptability at long timescales while ensuring an elastic network response at timescales that are short compared to the cross - linker off - rate ( 1 ) . Nature offers a huge variety of actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) to tailor the microstructure and the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton . To achieve high versatility , cells make use of the inherent biochemical differ - ences of diverse ABPs . These differences manifest themselves in distinct interaction potentials , which above all can be manip - ulated by forces acting on the actin / ABP bond—a strategy that cells can pursue by creating internal stresses ( 2 ) . To shed light on the link between the biochemical diversity of cross - linking proteins and the mechanical response of the cytoskeleton , one needs to address the underlying physical principles . For this purpose , in vitro model systems have been proven essential ( 3 ) . Depending on the microstructure of such reconstituted networks , a macroscopic deformation can be transmitted to the microscopic level of single ﬁlaments and individual cross - linking molecules in an afﬁne or nonafﬁne manner ( 4 – 8 ) . In either case , large forces can evoke rupturing of the actin / ABP bond ( 6 , 9 ) , which further complicates the complex nonlinear behavior of actin networks ( 10 – 12 ) . In a previous study , we have shown that in the absence of external or internal forces , thermal energy is sufﬁcient to entail cross - linker unbinding events , which determine the dynamic network response at low frequencies ( 13 ) . While it has been shown that the static elastic response of cross - linked actin networks depends crucially on the structure and size of the cross - linking molecules ( 14 ) , the dynamic viscoelastic response should sensitively depend on the microscopic interaction potential of actin / ABP bonds . The dynamic interplay between actin ﬁla - ments and ABPs is set by biochemical parameters such as the binding energy E B , the cross - linker on - and off - rate k on and k off , and the position of the transition state D x , which represents the characteristic bond length ( Fig . 1 ) . Typically , these param - eters are determined by a combination of biochemical and singlemoleculestudies ( 15 , 16 ) . Forfurtherprogressinamicro - scopicunderstandingofcellularmechanics , itneedstobeshown whether these biochemical properties of the cross - linking molecules are closely linked to their mechanical function . In this study , we demonstrate that the macromechanical response of transiently cross - linked actin networks sensitively depends on the interaction potential of single actin / ABP bonds . While the static network elasticity can be rationalized by the network microstructure , we show that the biochemical properties of single cross - links dictate the frequency response of transiently cross - linked actin networks . For a detailed analysis of this frequency response , we choose rigor - heavy meromyosin ( HMM ) as an actin cross - linking molecule . Rigor - HMM creates isotropically cross - linked actin networks , which are ideally suited to quantify the impact of microscopic cross - linker unbinding events on the macro - scopic network response . Here , the dependence of the visco - elastic network response on the cross - linker concentration , temperature , and external force is traced back to key parame - ters of the actin / HMM interaction potential , which character - izes the unbinding process of the actin / HMM bond . The off - rate , the binding energy , and the position of the transition state are quantitatively determined from the viscoelastic frequency spectrum of the network by utilizing a microscopic model , which is predicated on single unbinding events .

The G - actin solutions are kept at 4 (cid:3) C and used within seven days of preparation . The average length of the actin ﬁlaments is controlled to 21 m m using gelsolin obtained from bovine plasma serum , following Kurokawa et al . ( 18 ) . HMM is prepared from myosin II by chymotrypsin digestion and tested using motility assays , as in Uhde et al . ( 19 ) . Rheology The viscoelastic response of actin / HMM - networks is determined by measuring the frequency - dependent viscoelastic moduli G 0 ( f ) and G 00 ( f ) with a stress - controlled rheometer ( Physica MCR 301 ; Anton Paar , Graz , Austria ) over a frequency range of three decades . Approximately 500 m L sample volume is loaded within 1 min into the rheometer using a 50 - mm plate - plategeometrywith160 - m mplateseparation . Toensurelinearresponse , small torques ( z 0 . 5 m N m ) are applied . The transition to rigor HMM upon ATP depletion is followed by recording the elastic response G 0 ( 0 . 5 Hz ) of theactin / HMMnetworkintime . Intheexperiments , themolarratio R between HMM and actin , R ¼ c HMM / c a , is varied ; actin polymerization is carried out in situ , as described before in Luan et al . ( 20 ) . To determine the force depen - dence of the viscoelastic response , increasing amounts of constant prestress s 0 are applied . Only densely cross - linked networks are investigated under prestresstoavoidplasticdeformationduringthemeasurement . Fullrelaxation of the network is ensured in between two prestress measurements . The frequency dependence of G 0 ( f ) and G 00 ( f ) is determined with an oscillating measuring stress s m ( t ) ¼ s 0 m (cid:4) sin ( 2 p f $ t ) , whereas s 0 m ¼ 0 . 2 (cid:4) s 0 . Data analysis Microscopic parameters such as the cross - linker off - rate are obtained from the experimental frequency spectra by globally ﬁtting the following equa - tions to each set of measurements : G 0 ð f Þ ¼ G 0 (cid:2) a (cid:4) Nk off k 2off 4 p 2 þ f 2 þ b (cid:4) (cid:2) f f 0 (cid:3) 3 = 4 ; ( 1 ) G 00 ð f Þ ¼ c (cid:4) Nf k 2off 4 p 2 þ f 2 þ d (cid:4) (cid:2) f f 0 (cid:3) 3 = 4 : ( 2 ) In brief , N denotes the number of cross - links formed and k off denotes the off - rate of the cross - link . The ﬁrst term containing the prefactors a and c describes the amount of energy that is dissipated because of cross - link unbinding , whereas the second term containing the prefactors b and d repre - sents the ﬂuctuation of single ﬁlaments in semiﬂexible polymer networks . The timescale of this second relaxation mode is set by the factor f 0 , which is a function of the solvent viscosity h and the ﬁlament density but is ﬁxed to 1 Hz for most of the experiments . A detailed derivation of these equations including a full discussion of all involved parameters is given in Lieleg et al . ( 13 ) . As also discussed there , this model can quantitatively reproduce the frequency response of a cross - linked network for frequencies f R f max , where f max ¼ k off / 2 p denotes the frequency of maximal low frequency dissi - pation . At lower frequencies , a third microscopic mechanism has to be considered that is not captured by this model . The detailed values of all ﬁtting parameters are given in the Appendix . It is important to note that ac ¼ const : and bd ¼ const : for all experiments , which signiﬁcantly reduces the number of free ﬁtting parameters . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Actin networks formed by rigor - HMM are homogeneous and isotropically cross - linked . Therefore , the network elas - ticity depends solely on one length scale , which is the cross - linker distance l c ( 6 , 20 ) . However , it is important to note that the formed cross - links are not covalent : they can unbind and rebind . The transient nature of actin / HMM cross - links becomes evident in a step - stress experiment . Such an experiment is conducted for a strongly cross - linked actin / HMM network ( R ¼ 0 . 1 ) as depicted in Fig . 2 A . At intermediate timescales ( z 40 – 60 s ) , the network exhibits signiﬁcant creep , which does not entail plastic deformation of the network . Multiple un - and rebinding events of cross - linking molecules follow the direction of force application , during which the overall network microstructure is preserved , giving rise to a well - reproducible network response . Yet , the occurrence of signiﬁcant creep behavior in a densely cross - linked network clearly demonstrates the transient character of the cross - links . This transient nature of the formed cross - links is underlined by a second observation : at intermediate frequencies , i . e . between 0 . 1 Hz and 1 Hz , transiently cross - linked actin / HMM networks exhibit a minimum in the loss modulus G 00 ( f ) ( 6 , 9 ) , which characterizes the viscous dissipation . As shown before , this minimum results from the competition of thermally activated cross - link unbinding events at low frequencies and the ﬂuctuation of single ﬁlaments at high frequencies . It can be suppressed if the cross - link is stabilized by a covalent linkage ( 13 ) . For isotropically cross - linked networks as formed by rigor - HMM , the minimum in the FIGURE 1 ( A ) In cross - linked actin networks , a transient bond can unbind because of thermal activation , k B T , or upon force application . ( B ) The tran - sient actin / ABP cross - link can be characterized by an interaction potential . The key parameters are the cross - linker off - rate , k off , the binding energy , E B , and the position of the transition state , D x . Biophysical Journal 96 ( 11 ) 4725 – 4732 4726 Lieleg et al . viscous dissipation is well pronounced—its exact position depends on both the actin concentration and the cross - linker density R , as depicted in Fig . 3 . At low frequencies , a maximum in the viscous dissipation is detectable , whose position f max is independent from R . It is important to note that , in this low frequency regime , the network response is still dominated by elasticity , which is consistent with the signiﬁ - cant recovery of the network upon stress release ( Fig . 2 A ) . The frequency spectra of isotropically cross - linked actin / HMM networks can be quantitatively reproduced by a semi - phenomenological model , which was introduced in Lieleg et al . ( 13 ) . In this article we demonstrate , step - by - step , how this model can be employed to determine the microscopic interaction potential of actin / HMM cross - links from the macroscopic network response of cross - linked actin / HMM networks . To validate the obtained results , a comparison with independently obtained parameter values is crucial . The biochemical interaction of actin and rigor HMM has been characterized in great detail ( 21 ) . This makes actin / HMM networks ideal for a quantitative analysis of the visco - elastic network response . In a cross - linker concentration series as depicted in Fig . 3 A , the cross - linker off - rate is constant , which makes this set of measurements perfectly suitable to determine k off . The total number of cross - links N is set by experimental conditions . As discussed before ( 6 , 13 ) , the scaling relation G 0 (cid:5) k 20 = k B T x 2 l 3 c (cid:5) N describes the static network elasticity G 0 on the basis of microscopic parameters such as the actin ﬁlament bending stiffness k 0 , the network mesh size x , and the average cross - linker distance l c , utilizing an afﬁne stretching model ( 22 ) . In essence , this relation correlates the number of cross - links N with the macroscopic network elasticity . With the experimental constraint G 0 ~ R 1 . 2 ( 6 , 20 ) , the best reproduction of the data set is obtained for k off z ( 0 . 30 (cid:6) 0 . 05 ) s (cid:2) 1 . A similar result is obtained if the actin concentration is varied at a ﬁxed cross - linker concentration ( e . g . , R ¼ 0 . 1 ) , as depicted in Fig . 3 B . Here , k off z ( 0 . 23 (cid:6) 0 . 05 ) s (cid:2) 1 is obtained , which agrees well FIGURE 2 The transient nature of actin / HMM cross - links dictates the viscoelastic response of the macroscopic network . ( A ) A stress pulse of 0 . 1 Pa height and 60 s duration is applied to a transiently cross - linked actin / HMM network ( R ¼ 0 . 1 , c a ¼ 9 . 5 m M ) and the resulting deformation is recorded .

( B ) Extended frequency spectrum of a transiently cross - linked actin / HMM network ( R ¼ 0 . 1 , c a ¼ 9 . 5 m M ) . A clear maximum in the viscous dissipation is located at f max z 0 . 03 Hz .

Biophysical Journal 96 ( 11 ) 4725 – 4732 Cross - Linked Actin Networks 4727 with both the result obtained from the R - series and values determined by biochemical means ( 21 ) . Note that in the actin concentration series , the impact of single ﬁlament ﬂuctua - tions becomes more pronounced with increasing actin concentrations . Consistently , the single ﬁlament ﬂuctuation parameter d depends roughly linear on the actin concentra - tion—representing the increasing density of actin ﬁlaments . At higher ﬁlament densities the entanglement length decreases , which facilitates the formation of cross - links at a given cross - linker concentration . Thus , in the actin concen - tration series , the effective cross - link density is increased as well . This makes this experiment qualitatively very similar to the R - series discussed before . In both cases , the variation of the cross - link density allows for the extraction of the cross - linker off - rate of individual actin / HMM bonds . This ﬁnding conﬁrms that the timescale at which the energy dissipation in the cross - linked network is minimal is set not only by the static density of the cross - links but also by the dynamic off - rate of the actin / ABP bond . In addition , since cross - link unbinding determines the frequency response of transiently cross - linked networks , the characteristic binding energy of the cross - link should be obtainable from temperature dependent frequency sweeps . The results depicted in Fig . 3 demonstrate that thermal energy is sufﬁcient to drive the actin / HMM bond across the potential barrier . The binding energy E B is dissipated every time an unbinding event occurs between the cross - linking molecule and the actin ﬁlament . E B characterizes the cross - link and sets the total ratio of bound / unbound molecules . This gives rise to an inherent temperature dependence of the binding constant K ( T ) ~ exp ( – E B / k B T ) . Thus , investigating the frequency spectrum of a cross - linked actin network at different temperatures should be an appropriate approach to determine the binding energy of a single cross - link . We conduct a series of linear response measurements in a temperature range of 10 – 30 (cid:3) C , as depicted in Fig . 4 A . Starting at 21 (cid:3) C , where the network has been polymerized , we vary the sample temperature using a protocol of oscil - lating temperature steps ( T ¼ 21 (cid:3) C / 15 (cid:3) C / 25 (cid:3) C / 10 (cid:3) C / 30 (cid:3) C ) , providing adequate time for thermal equili - bration ( Fig . 4 C ) . This protocol guarantees that a putative change in the observed network response is purely due to thermal effects and not superimposed by time - dependent changes like sample aging . As depicted in Fig . 4 A , a contin - uous decrease in both viscoelastic moduli is observed with increasing temperature T . Within the ﬁtting accuracy , a repro - duction of the data set by the model described in Lieleg et al . ( 13 ) results in an approximately constant off - rate , k off z 0 . 3 s (cid:2) 1 , although a small variation of k off with temperature within a factor of 2 would still be consistent with the data . This is in contrast to actin / a - actinin - 4 networks ( 23 ) , where a strong dependence of this off - rate ( called ‘‘network relax - ation frequency’’ in ( 23 ) ) on temperature is observed . Furthermore , a decrease of the static elasticity G 0 with increasing T ( Fig . 4 B ) and a shift of the timescale of the single ﬁlament relaxation regime , t 0 ¼ 1 / f 0 ( 13 ) , is observed . This time can be normalized by the solvent viscosity h yielding t 0 h . This parameter is almost independent of T ( Fig . 4 B ) , indicating that the observed shift of this timescale with respect to T is simply given by the temperature depen - dence of the solvent viscosity . As the static plateau modulus G 0 of isotropically cross - linked actin networks depends solely on the total number of intact cross - links , the experimental scaling relation G 0 ~ R 1 . 2 ( 6 , 20 ) can be rewritten using the number of effectively bound cross - linker molecules R eff . With the binding constant of rigor - HMM to actin K ¼ 1 . 2 (cid:4) 10 6 M (cid:2) 1 ( 21 ) we obtain G 0 ¼ 157 Pa (cid:4) R 1 : 1 eff for c a ¼ 9 . 5 m M ( 6 ) . Using the law of mass action , R eff can be calculated as a function of R and K : R eff ¼ 1 2 " (cid:2) 1 þ R þ 1 c a K ð T Þ (cid:3) (cid:2) ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ(cid:5) 1 þ R þ 1 c a K ð T Þ (cid:6) 2 (cid:2) 4 R s # : With the temperature dependence of the binding constant K , the binding energy of the actin / HMM bond can be numeri - cally extracted from the G 0 ( R eff ( T ) ) data depicted in Fig . 4 B to be E B z ( (cid:2) 40 (cid:6) 4 ) kJ (cid:4) mol (cid:2) 1 —in excellent agreement with the literature value of ( (cid:2) 39 (cid:6) 1 ) kJ (cid:4) mol (cid:2) 1 ( 24 ) . A similar temperature dependence was reported for actin FIGURE 4 ( A ) Frequency response of actin / HMM networks ( c a ¼ 9 . 5 m M , R ¼ 0 . 1 ) at distinct temperatures ( 10 (cid:3) C ( > ) up to 30 (cid:3) C ( 6 ) ) .

There , the compli - cated and heterogeneous microstructure of a - actinin networks deﬁed a quantitative comparison of the macroscopic network elasticity with the cross - linker afﬁnity . However , our results on actin / HMM networks clearly demonstrate that the binding energy of a single cross - link determines the temperature dependence of the network response of transiently cross - linked actin networks . Although cells can react only passively to changes in the temperature of their environment , adjusting the local density or composition of cross - linking molecules gives them the possibility to actively tune their mechanical properties . Another strategy to actively control cytoskeletal mechanics is given by creating internal forces . It was shown that living cells exploit molecular motors to create and maintain a certain level of internal stress to increase the elastic response of the cytoskeleton ( 2 ) . However , it remains to be analyzed how external or internal forces acting on cytoskel - etal networks affect the binding kinetics of cross - linking molecules and therefore the dynamic viscoelastic network response . A microscopic parameter dictating the sensitivity of a transient actin / ABP bond toward forces is the characteristic bond length , D x . This parameter marks the position of the transition state of the binding / unbinding process . Having demonstrated that the viscoelastic response of a transiently cross - linked actin / HMM network is set by the off - rate and the binding energy of the actin / HMM bond , it is now addressed whether the bond length D x inﬂuences the network mechanics . If this is the case , the bond length should be obtainable from the macroscopic network response by employing the force dependence of the binding kinetics of the cross - linker . For cross - linked bundle networks as they are formed by the ABP fascin , it has been shown that the rupture force of an actin / fascin bond depends on the loading rate in a logarith - mic manner ( 9 ) , as expected from single molecule experi - ments ( 26 ) . There , a variation of the force loading rate allows for shifting the rupture force distribution and thus deter - mining D x . A similar principle should also be applicable here ; however , instead of studying the loading rate depen - dence of the rupture force , the application of a constant prestress ( 11 ) should already be sufﬁcient to characterize the cross - link unbinding process in the presence of external force , provided that plastic deformations are avoided . There - fore , the frequency dependence of the viscoelastic network response of densely cross - linked actin / HMM networks ( R ¼ 0 . 1 and R ¼ 0 . 2 ) in the presence of varying external prestress s 0 is analyzed ( Fig . 5 , A and B ) . As depicted in Fig . 6 A , the static network elasticity increases linearly with the prestress , G 0 ~ s 0 . Furthermore , the global ﬁt of the prestress series requires an increase of both stress relaxation parameters a ( s 0 ¼ 0 ) ¼ 3 (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) 16 Pa / s and c ( s 0 ¼ 0 ) ¼ 2 (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) 15 Pa / s in proportion with the prestress s 0 ( Fig . 6 B ) ; however , a c ¼ const : This shows that the amount of dissipated energy upon cross - link unbinding as well as the loss in the network elasticity are both enhanced in the presence of prestress—with the same dependence on s 0 . Interestingly , the same scaling behavior is observed for the parameter d ( s 0 ¼ 0 ) ¼ 0 . 08 Pa , which describes the high frequency regime that is dominated by the ﬂuctuations of single ﬁlaments . Concomitantwiththeenhancednetworkelasticity , anexpo - nential decrease of the apparent cross - linker off - rate is observedforbothcross - linkerdensitiesstudiedhere ( Fig . 6 C ) . In an isotropically cross - linked actin network , the macro - scopic stress will be transduced to single actin / ABP bonds following the geometry of the network . Depending on the orientation of the cross - link relative to the direction of the applied force , a distribution of force vectors will be present . Partially , they will stabilize or destabilize the bonds . With the simpliﬁed assumption that stabilizing and destabilizing FIGURE 5 Frequency response of actin / HMM networks ( c a ¼ 9 . 5 m M ) at distinct levels of prestress s 0 .

The maximum level of prestress is chosen in such a way that the networks still show complete relaxation to their original ( unstressed ) state upon stress release . Biophysical Journal 96 ( 11 ) 4725 – 4732 Cross - Linked Actin Networks 4729 forces of identical magnitude are equally probable , a decrease in the apparent cross - linker off - rate of the network with increasing force can be rationalized ( see Appendix ) . With that an Arrhenius law , k F off ¼ k 0off (cid:4) exp ð(cid:2) s 0 = s (cid:7) Þ , can be ﬁtted to the observed decay of k off in Fig . 6 C . Here , k F off and k 0off denotethecross - linkeroff - ratein thepresenceandabsence of external force , F , and s * is the characteristic decay stress . The magnitude of force that is transduced to a single bond is given by the level of prestress as F ~ s 0 . In a Bell model ( 27 ) , the characteristic bond length is described by the position of thetransitionstate D x . Asaconsequence , thefollowingrela - tion can be assumed to hold : s 0 s (cid:7) ¼ F (cid:4) D x = k B T . To extract the bondlength D x fromthisrelation , theratio F / s 0 hastobedeter - mined for any level of prestress . We assume that F / s 0 depends only on the network geometry and not on the magnitude of the applied force . Therefore , the point of bond rupturing is chosen to determinethisratiosincetheruptureeventis experimentally accessible . For actin / HMM networks , the rupture force of a single bond was determined to be z 8 pN , and the corre - sponding rupture stress is s 0 z 30 – 40 Pa ( 6 ) for R ¼ 0 . 14 . Hence , the bond length D x can directly be calculated from the decay stress s * ¼ ( 10 . 6 (cid:6) 1 . 3 ) Pa to be D x z ( 1 . 9 (cid:6) 0 . 7 ) nm . This is in excellent agreement with literature values obtained from microscopic studies of the actin / HMM bond . There , a bond length D x t ¼ 0 . 5 nm ( 28 ) and D x k ¼ 2 nm ( 29 ) wasreported , depending onwhethertheforce wasapplied orthogonally to the binding direction ( 28 ) or in a parallel manner ( 29 ) . Indeed , our simple considerations give a reason - able value D x t < D x < D x k . This might reﬂect the fact that , in an isotropically cross - linked network , a distribution of various force directions is present . However , simulations might be necessary to determine this force distribution in detail . In conclusion , we have demonstrated that the microscopic interaction potential of an actin / ABP bond determines the macroscopic viscoelastic response of a transiently cross - linked actin network . The transient character of actin / ABP bonds gives rise to a delicate sensitivity of cytoskeletal mechanics toward external or internal forces . This might provide a central mechanism that living cells can exploit for mechanosensing tasks . Because distinct ABPs differ in their biochemical prop - erties such as the off - rate , binding energy , or bond length , the corresponding actin / ABP interaction potentials provide a formidable basis to tailor the dynamic viscoelastic response of the cytoskeleton . Vice versa , we have shown that the inter - action potential of the actin / HMM bond can be characterized by analyzing solely the macroscopic viscoelastic response of a cross - linked actin network . A selection of appropriate measuring protocols in combination with a microscopic model allows us to determine the off - rate , binding energy , and bond length of the actin / HMM unbinding process . Collective phenomena do not have to be accounted for in isotropically cross - linked networks , as the parameters determined from the macroscopic network response are in excellent agreement with single molecule experiments . The off - rate of the actin / HMM bond is very similar to those of other actin / ABP bonds , such as actin / fascin ( 30 ) , actin / a - actinin ( 31 ) , or actin / ﬁlamin ( 31 ) . This suggests that unbinding of cross - linking molecules is an ubiquitous mechanism , which dictates the dynamic properties of isotropically cross - linked actin networks at bio - logically relevant timescales . Indeed , the frequency responses reported in a recent study on reconstituted actin networks cross - linked by a - actinin - 4 ( 23 ) ﬁt qualitatively very well into the approach presented here . Our results , however , set the basis to quantitatively address the microscopic principles underlying the macromechanical properties of more compli - cated networks , be it purely bundled or composite networks as used by living cells .

The corresponding values are compiled in Table 2 . T - series For the temperature series depicted in Fig . 4 A , k off ¼ 0 . 3 s (cid:2) 1 is used together with a ¼ 3 (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) 16 Pa / s , b ¼ 0 . 4 Pa , c ¼ 2 (cid:4) 0 (cid:2) 15 Pa / s , and d ¼ 0 . 3 Pa . N is varied linearly with G 0 , which is depicted in Fig . 4 B . Prestress - series Both prestress series depicted in Fig . 5 , A and B , use constant N values and f 0 ¼ 1 Hz . The dependence of all other parameters is explicitly discussed in the article . Apparent off - rate in a cross - linked network under prestress In prestressed actin / HMM networks a decrease in the apparent off - rate with respect to external prestress is observed ( Fig . 6 C ) . In single molecule exper - iments with rigor HMM , such a decrease of the cross - link off - rate in the presence of mechanical load has already been reported ( 29 ) —consistent with a catch - slip mechanism of the actin / HMM bond . However , a simple approximation shows that in a network of cross - linked actin ﬁlaments the network geometry gives rise to a decrease in the apparent cross - linker off - rate in the presence of mechanical load . Moreover , this decrease in the apparent cross - linker off - rate is independent of the particular binding mech - anism and therefore a geometrical effect . In the following , the effective off - rate is calculated for a model system where the cross - links experience forces of constant magnitude but with random algebraic sign : F (cid:6) ¼ (cid:6) F 0 ~ (cid:6) s 0 . This extremely simpliﬁed model is able to rationalize the counterintuitive dependence of the off - rate on external force—at least in a qualitative manner . The actual force distribution will be much more complex . If the forces F (cid:6) ¼ (cid:6) F 0 ~ (cid:6) s 0 load an ensemble of N S bonds , two different off - rates k þ off ¼ k off (cid:4) exp ( þ F (cid:4) D x / k B T ) and k off (cid:2) ¼ k off (cid:4) exp ( (cid:2) F $ D x / k B T ) emerge : N S ¼ N þ þ N (cid:2) . Here N þ denotes the number of cross - links with enhanced off - rate ( destabilized fraction ) and N (cid:2) denotes the number of cross - links with lowered off - rate ( stabilized fraction ) . This deﬁnes an effective off - rate k effoff for the whole ensemble of N S cross - links : k effoff (cid:4) N S ¼ k þ off (cid:4) N þ þ k (cid:2) off (cid:4) N (cid:2) : ( 3 ) For constant on - rates ( note that this assumption is reasonable since , during the binding process , a cross - linking protein does not feel any external force acting on the actin ﬁlaments ) , k þ on ¼ k (cid:2) on , the two populations N þ and N (cid:2) equilibrate according to the difference in their off - rates : N þ N (cid:2) ¼ k (cid:2) off k þ off : ( 4 ) Eliminating N (cid:2) in Eq . 4 results in N þ ¼ N S (cid:4) k (cid:2) off k þ off þ k (cid:2) off : ( 5 ) Together with Eqs . 3 and 4 , one obtains k effoff ¼ 2 (cid:4) k þ off (cid:4) k (cid:2) off k þ off þ k (cid:2) off ; ( 6 ) which results in the apparent off - rate k effoff ¼ 2 (cid:4) k 0off exp ð þ F (cid:4) D x = k B T Þ þ exp ð (cid:2) F (cid:4) D x = k B T Þ ; ( 7 ) which can be rewritten to k effoff ¼ k 0off / cosh ( F (cid:4) D x / k B T ) < k 0off .
