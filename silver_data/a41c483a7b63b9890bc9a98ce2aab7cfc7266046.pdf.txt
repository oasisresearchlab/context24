We integrate these data into a mechanistic epidemic model calibrated on surveillance data . As of August 1 st 2020 , we es - timate a detection rate of 102 cases per 1 , 000 infections ( 90 % CI : [ 95 - 112 per 1 , 000 ] ) . We show that the introduction of a full lockdown on May 15 th , 2020 , while causing a modest additional decrease in mobility and contacts with respect to previous NPIs , was decisive in bringing the epidemic under control , highlighting the importance of a timely governmental response to COVID - 19 outbreaks . We ﬁnd that the impact of NPIs on individuals’ mobility correlates with the Human Development Index of comunas in the city . Indeed , more developed and wealthier areas became more isolated after government interventions and experienced a signiﬁcantly lower burden of the pandemic . The hetero - geneity of COVID - 19 impact raises important issues in the implementation of NPIs and highlights the challenges that communities aﬀected by systemic health and social inequalities face adapting their behaviors during an epidemic . 1 Introduction As of September 1 st , 2020 , Chile has reported more than 400 , 000 cases and 590 SARS - CoV - 2 deaths per million , becoming one of the worst COVID - 19 epidemic globally [ 1 ] . Oﬃcially , the ﬁrst SARS - CoV - 2 case in Chile was detected on March 3 rd , 2020 [ 2 ] . Although other cases were rapidly conﬁrmed all over the country , the urban area of the capital city , Santiago Metropolitan Region , quickly became the epicenter of the national epidemic . Indeed , as of September 1 st , 2020 , about 70 % of the total cases in the nation have been reported in the comunas ( i . e . municipalities ) of Santiago , making it one of the largest urban COVID - 19 outbreak in the world . The ﬁrst set of non - pharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ) were put in place in mid - March , when schools were closed , public gatherings were banned , and passengers traveling from high - risk countries were mandated to self - isolate for 14 days . However , the adopted measures were not able to contain the contagion : after a sharp increase in cases , a full lockdown was instituted to the whole area of Santiago on May 15 th [ 3 ] . In this work , we model the spatial and temporal spread of COVID - 19 in 37 comunas of the urban area of Santiago . We aim to provide a data - driven characterization of the unfolding of the COVID - 19 epidemic and an estimation of the impact of NPIs on its spreading . To this end , we study the reduction of mobility and contacts inferred from mobile devices as input for a spatially structured epidemic model . In fact , mobile devices data can be used to evaluate , in near real - time , the eﬀects of interventions and self - initiated behavioral changes on the mobility of people and to inform large scale epidemic models [ 4 – 8 ] . Here , we use anonymised data provided by a major mobile phone operator in South America ( Telef´onica Movistar ) , with a market share of 24 . 61 % as of March 2020 . ∗ n . perra @ greenwich . ac . uk 1 .

To characterize the changes of mobility and physical contacts during the outbreak , we used anonymised data from 1 . 4 million mobile devices ( about 22 % of the total population in the comunas under consid - eration ) . We ﬁnd consistent downward trends coinciding with the NPIs issued by local and national authorities . We estimate that the ﬁrst set of NPIs issued on 16 / 03 led to a reduction of about 48 % in the number of travels between comunas . An additional 17 % reduction is observed with the introduction of the full lockdown on 15 / 05 . Furthermore , we ﬁnd that changes in mobility patterns strongly correlate with the economic and development indicators of the comunas . We develop a stochastic mechanistic epidemic model integrating the real - time mobility , physical contacts , and census data . The model suggests that the full lockdown , while causing a modest additional decrease in mobility and physical contacts with respect to the NPIs already in place , was decisive in bringing the epidemic under control . This relatively small additional decrease in mobility and contacts was enough to push the eﬀective reproductive number below the critical value of 1 , a clear example of the threshold eﬀects characterizing epidemic dynamics on structured mobility networks [ 9 ] . We estimate that the full lockdown prevented an additional 34 . 7 % ( 95 % CI : [ 27 . 2 % , 44 . 1 % ] ) increase in the total number of deaths . Additionally , we estimate the critical impact of the timing of the full lockdown through counterfactual scenarios : an additional week of delay would have corresponded to an 18 . 1 % ( 95 % CI : [ 6 . 0 % , 34 . 0 % ] ) more intense incidence peak according to our estimates . The model captures the heterogeneous burden of COVID - 19 across comunas , observed in the epidemiological data reported by the national surveillance . This highlights how communities exhibiting systemic social disparities are aﬀected in a diﬀerential way by government - mandated NPIs due to challenges faced in reducing their mobility and contacts , raising the issue of health disparities in the management of emerging infectious diseases such as COVID - 19 . 2 Results We evaluate the eﬀects of NPIs policies , government - mandated mobility limitations by integrating mobile phone data and an epidemic model . We identify three phases of the epidemic management in Santiago : i ) before 16 / 03 ( business as usual , baseline ) ii ) between 16 / 03 and 15 / 05 ( ﬁrst set of NPIs interventions ) , and iii ) after 15 / 05 ( full lockdown ) . For convenience , we will refer to the period 16 / 03 - 15 / 05 as the partial lockdown and to the period after 15 / 05 as the full lockdown . It is important to notice how the timeline of interventions is fairly complex . It includes night curfews , dynamic quarantine , and lockdowns restricted to a few comunas across the region studied here and in other parts of Chile [ 2 ] . However , as we see below , the data suggest that those measures did not have a signiﬁcant impact on people’s behaviors , thus for simplicity we consider the two main sets of NPIs only . We characterize the three phases outlined above in terms of a ) mobility among comunas , and b ) contacts reduction between individuals . Commuting describes the ( varying ) rates at which people travel among diﬀerent comunas , while contacts reduction parameters estimate to what extent physical contacts drop in each comuna ( more details in the Materials and Methods section ) . 2 . 1 Eﬀects of NPIs and Social Inequalities In Fig . 1A we provide an overview of mobility in Santiago during the period of study . As a proxy for general mobility , we consider the number of devices visiting a comuna that is diﬀerent from their home one ( see Material and Methods section ) . We observe a sharp drop following the ﬁrst set of interventions on 16 / 03 . Afterwards , mobility remains fairly constant until the introduction of the full lockdown on 15 / 05 , when we observe an additional ∼ 15 % decrease . As we will show below , this intervention represented an important tipping point of the epidemic in Santiago . More in detail , we represent changes in commuting among comunas in Fig . 1B . The partial lockdown causes an average drop of about 48 % , while , with the introduction of the full lockdown , commuting drops by 65 % with respect to the baseline . For each comuna we also consider the mean percentage decrease in commuting after 16 / 03 and compare it with the Human Development Index ( HDI ) , a coeﬃcient that measures key aspects of human development , such as life expectancy , education , and per capita income [ 10 ] . In Fig . 1C , we observe that a greater decrease in mobility is generally associated with a higher HDI ( Pearson correlation coeﬃcient ρ = − 0 . 80 , p < 0 . 001 ) . The same trend is observed in the absolute change of mobility ( see the Supplementary Information ) suggesting that wealthier and more developed comunas became more isolated after the interventions . This result is in line with previous studies that showed how changes in mobility patterns following government - issued interventions , and the extent to which people can aﬀord social distancing , vary across diﬀerent socio - demographic groups [ 11 ] . 2 .

C ) Average percentage commuting decreases after 16 / 03 versus HDI of diﬀerent comunas . D ) Scatter plot of contacts reduction parameters during partial ( r partialj ) and full ( r fullj ) lockdown . Dots size is proportional to the distance from the diagonal ( bigger dots indicate comunas where contacts decreased more after the full lockdown ) . In Fig . 1D , we represent contacts reduction parameters . Across the board , contacts drop by 36 % with the ﬁrst set of NPIs policies and by an additional 11 % with the lockdown . Since all points are below the diagonal , we conclude that , with the introduction of the full lockdown , contacts decrease further in all comunas . Also , the decrease is consistent with the existing reductions after the partial lockdown . In - deed r partialj and r fullj show a high signiﬁcant correlation ( Kendall rank correlation coeﬃcient τ = 0 . 79 , p < 0 . 001 ) . 3 .

The model is calibrated on oﬃcial surveillance data and takes as initial seeding the realistic projections of active cases on March 1 st , 2020 in the Metropolitan area of Santiago from Ref . [ 7 ] . We use an Approximate Bayesian Computation ( ABC ) approach [ 12 , 13 ] ( see details in the Materials and Methods section ) to ﬁnd the posterior distribution of the reproductive number in Santiago ( median R 0 = 2 . 66 , 95 % CI : [ 2 . 58 , 2 . 72 ] ) , which is in line with previous ﬁndings that identify the value of R 0 of SARS - CoV - 2 to be in the range between 2 and 3 in diﬀerent countries [ 14 – 16 ] . In Fig . 2A we report the number of weekly deaths projected by the model together with oﬃcial ﬁgures ( used for calibration ) . The two time series show a good agreement with a high correlation ( ρ = 0 . 99 , p < 0 . 001 ) and a median absolute percentage error of 12 % . Interestingly , the agreement between data and model starts to deviate in the last two data points ( end of July early August ) . We can speculate that , at least in part , this might be due to a lockdown fatigue . In fact , while the oﬃcial restrictions were relaxed later ( mid of August ) , a decrease in compliance , linked to the reduction of cases / deaths , could have taken place earlier . The period is outside our current data coverage . Hence , we leave testing such hypothesis to future work . As of August 1 st , 2020 , the median projected fraction of infected individuals in the area under study is 38 . 7 % ( 95 % CI : [ 35 . 1 % , 41 . 6 % ] ) . This estimate is about tenfold the oﬃcial reported ﬁgures . We are not aware of publicly available seroprevalence studies that we can use as a comparison and validation . For this reason , we can only consider qualitative evidence hinting that the Chilean outbreak has aﬀected a signiﬁcant fraction of the population . For example , the share of positive COVID - 19 tests peaked at 59 . 10 % on June 18 th , and in the Santiago Metropolitan Region the occupation of ICU beds reached almost saturation level ( 95 % ) in May . Also , a recent epidemiological study aimed at characterizing the ﬁrst wave in Chile showed signiﬁcant under - reporting of symptomatic cases ( around 50 % ) based on estimates of the Case Fatality Rate [ 2 ] . Finally , previous seroprevalence studies conducted , for example , in the United States [ 17 ] and Spain [ 18 ] , showed that the actual number of COVID - 19 infections is several times ( factors vary from 4 to 20 ) those reported by the oﬃcial surveillance . As a sensitivity check , we repeated the calibration considering the upper limit of the 95 % credible interval for the infection fatality rate from Ref . [ 19 ] . This leads to a projected median prevalence of 28 . 3 % ( 95 % CI : [ 23 . 5 % , 32 . 3 % ] ) but to a sensibly worse ﬁt of the data ( ρ = 0 . 82 , median percentage error of 49 % ) . Projected cases present a good signiﬁcant correlation with oﬃcial numbers as can be observed in Fig . 2B ( ρ = 0 . 84 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Besides , we compare the dates when 200 infections have been reached in diﬀerent comunas according to our model and oﬃcial surveillance , ﬁnding a signiﬁcant correlation ( Kendall rank correlation coeﬃcient τ = 0 . 61 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Similar results are found considering in - stead the dates when 50 , 100 , and 500 cases have been reached ( see the Supplementary Information ) . Interestingly , the same dates estimated through modeling are much earlier , hinting that many of the infections in the initial phase of the spreading went unreported . In Fig . 2C we show the attack rates versus the HDI of diﬀerent comunas . We ﬁnd a strong correlation between attack rates computed on oﬃcially reported cases and HDI ( ρ = − 0 . 74 , p < 0 . 001 ) , providing evidence that wealthier comunas experienced signiﬁcantly smaller outbreaks . In addition , the very same picture emerges from our mod - elling results . Indeed , simulated attack rates present a high signiﬁcant correlation with HDI ( ρ = − 0 . 69 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Finally , in Fig . 2D we show the number of deaths per 1 , 000 versus the HDI of diﬀerent comunas . We ﬁnd a signiﬁcant correlation between HDI and both simulated ( ρ = − 0 . 50 , p < 0 . 002 ) and oﬃcially reported ( ρ = − 0 . 40 , p < 0 . 02 ) deaths , hinting that wealthier comunas experienced also a smaller burden in terms of casualties . We note that the correlations obtained in this case are lower than those found previously for the attack rates . This may be due to the interplay between diverse age distributions and age - dependent mortality rates . Indeed comunas with higher HDI have a higher mean age and the infection fatality rate for COVID - 19 is signiﬁcantly higher in older age brackets . 2 . 3 Counterfactual Scenarios To assess the impact of heterogeneous responses to the spreading we run a hypothetical scenario in which commuting and contacts decrease uniformly across comunas , starting on 16 / 03 . More in detail , we apply to all comunas the average reduction in commuting and contacts observed for the 4 th quartile of HDI ( i . e . 25 % comunas with higher HDI ) . See the Supplementary Information for more details . According to our simulations , this leads to a signiﬁcant decrease of cases and deaths : - 83 . 8 % ( 95 % CI : [ - 77 . 6 % , - 88 . 6 % ] ) fewer cases and - 70 . 5 % ( 95 % CI : [ - 55 . 0 % , - 80 . 9 % ] ) fewer deaths as of May 15 th , the date when the full lockdown was enforced . Interestingly , the uniform reduction we are imposing implies a relatively 4 .

In this hypothetical scenario , with the partial lockdown commuting rates drop by 55 % and contacts by 49 % ( versus respectively the 48 % and the 36 % estimated in our main analysis ) . Although such homogeneous reduction across comunas is a theoretical exercise that does not consider complex socio - economic constraints , that go from the collective need to keep key supply chains active to the individual imperative to feed their own family , it crystallizes the dramatic eﬀects of inequality on disease spreading on the one side , and it shows the positive beneﬁts of equal , early , and strong responses on the 5 .

We also use the model to investigate counterfactual scenarios aimed at estimating the impact of NPIs on the spread of COVID - 19 in Santiago . As a ﬁrst counterfactual scenario , we simulated the epidemic in the absence of a full lockdown . From Fig . 3A we observe that this leads on average to a 21 . 6 % ( 95 % CI : [ 7 . 5 % , 41 . 3 % ] ) more intense incidence peak and 34 . 7 % ( 95 % CI : [ 27 . 2 % , 44 . 1 % ] ) more deaths . To estimate the impact of the timing of the full lockdown , we run simulations where we anticipate or delay it up to four weeks . According to results in Fig . 3B , an earlier lockdown implies a less intense incidence peak ( from around - 20 % to - 35 % ) . It is interesting to note , however , that a delay of 1 - 2 weeks has a very similar eﬀect of no intervention at all in terms of incidence peak intensity . More speciﬁcally , one week delay causes a 18 . 1 % ( 95 % CI : [ 6 . 0 % , 34 . 0 % ] ) while two weeks delay cause a 21 . 6 % ( 95 % CI : [ 7 . 4 % , 41 . 1 % ] ) more intense incidence peak . The timing of the full lockdown also has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the number of deaths . According to our estimates in Fig . 3B , just one week of delay implies a 7 . 7 % ( 95 % CI : [ 1 . 3 % , 13 . 7 % ] ) increase in mortality . 2 . 4 Eﬀective Reproduction Number In Fig . 3C we show the evolution of the eﬀective reproduction number R t estimated using the method from Ref . [ 20 ] on the simulated and the oﬃcial reported incidence . In the simulated R t time series we observe the two discontinuities after the implementation of government - issued NPIs . However , we note that the partial lockdown had the sole eﬀect of slowing down the epidemic . Indeed , after March 16 th the estimated R t is still greater than 1 . After the full lockdown , instead , R t was pushed below 1 making the containment possible . This is visible both in the simulated and the reported time series . This result underlines the importance of the full lockdown that , despite causing a relatively small eﬀect on mobility , had a decisive role in bringing the outbreak under control . It is worth stressing this result . The full lockdown constituted a key tipping point for the evolution of the epidemic pushing the reproductive number below its critical threshold . A similar ﬁnding has been recently reported for the evolution of the pandemic in Germany [ 21 ] . Indeed , also in that context , only the subsequent compounding of interventions was able to bring the reproductive number below one thus curbing the spreading the virus . 3 Discussion The analysis presented here shows that the eﬀects of NPIs issued by the government strongly correlate with a measure of human development , such as the HDI . In particular , comunas with higher HDI were able to reduce more signiﬁcantly their mobility . This , in turn , is reﬂected in both data and modeling estimates by a lower burden of COVID - 19 ( cases , deaths ) in the comunas characterized by a higher HDI . The combination of these results raises policy - making concerns . Indeed , while lockdowns are unquestionably eﬀective in mitigating the epidemic activity , they may as well augment social and health inequalities , penalizing more vulnerable communities . Other studies have found that mobility restrictions unequally aﬀected diﬀerent regions of France [ 8 ] , Italy [ 22 ] , United States [ 11 ] , Colombia , Mexico , and Indonesia [ 23 ] with a higher income being associated to a larger capacity to aﬀord social distancing . Furthermore , observations in the United States [ 11 , 24 – 26 ] , Singapore [ 27 ] and the UK [ 28 , 29 ] show that socio - economic inequalities are linked to worst health outcomes during the current pandemic . Our data - driven analysis also shows that the timeliness of NPIs is just one variable inﬂuencing the outcome of the mitigation eﬀort . The case of Santiago is emblematic . NPIs were introduced early respect to other countries . Only two days after the ﬁrst 50 conﬁrmed cases . For comparison , Denmark introduced measures after ﬁve , Austria after nine , Italy and Germany after ﬁfteen days of reaching that threshold [ 30 ] . These measures were followed by a considerable reduction in mobility and contacts , but cases soared anyway in the metropolitan area . According to our analysis , the ﬁrst set of NPIs signiﬁcantly slowed down transmissions but not enough to stop the epidemic . It was only after the introduction of the second additional lockdown that the Santiago outbreak was brought under control . This indicates that earlier implementation of more stringent NPIs may be beneﬁcial in quickly mitigating the outbreak without extending for a long time policies that potentially might unequally aﬀect communities . The present work comes with limitations . First , we focused only on the epidemic evolution within the Santiago Metropolitan Area and we overlooked both national and international importations after March 1 st , 2020 . While it is reasonable to assume that after this date the epidemic was largely sustained by the internal spreading ( especially considering the various restrictions on international and national mobility ) , we acknowledge this as a possible limitation . Second , compared to other approaches [ 31 – 33 ] , 6 .

The two time series show a high positive Pearson correlation coeﬃcient ( ρ = 0 . 78 , p < 0 . 001 ) . we considered a relatively simple disease dynamics . Lastly , we acknowledge that our mobile phone users’ sample was not selected to be representative of the whole population , but we know that Telef´onica Movistar data can well represent the diﬀerent socio - demographic groups of Santiago [ 34 ] . Overall , our study characterizes the unfolding of SARS - CoV - 2 in one of the largest metropolitan areas in South America ; a region that so far has received far less attention than others . It quantiﬁes the unequal eﬀects across communities of behavioral changes introduced by governmental measures as well as individual ( re ) actions and provides evidence that even small delays in the implementation of NPIs can have a signiﬁcant impact on the unfolding of the epidemic . 7 .

This stream records every interaction ( e . g . packet request ) between devices and antennas . An entry in our dataset can be formalized as a tuple (cid:104) d , t , a (cid:105) indicating a packet request to antenna a made by device d at time t . We approximate the position of d with that of the antenna , which has a ﬁxed latitude and longitude . We also assign a home antenna to each device by ﬁnding the most active antenna during night hours . Finally , we assign antennas to correspondent comunas according to their position . The dataset includes data for the period 2020 / 02 / 26 − 2020 / 06 / 01 for 1 . 4 million devices which correspond to the 22 % of the total population in the area considered . To preserve the privacy of device owners , we analyze and display only anonymous and aggregated results . Furthermore , no other information about the users ( i . e . gender , age etc . . ) was used nor available . As speciﬁed in the previous sections , we characterize the three phases of the outbreak in terms of commuting and contacts reduction . Commuting is measured considering the fraction of devices traveling between comunas . Formally , for each day t we build a commuting rate matrix Σ ( t ) ∈ R N × N whose element σ ij ( t ) is the fraction of devices living in comuna i that visited j on day t . We average these daily rates during the three phases to obtain three distinct matrices describing commuting i ) before any restrictions , ii ) during the partial lockdown , and iii ) during the full lockdown . It is important to notice that the data does not provide direct information about physical contacts be - tween users . Having the privacy of the users in mind , and considering the various non - trivial assumptions one would need to make , we do not attempt to estimate / infer such contacts . Instead , we focus on a metric that allows us to capture the variation before and after the various interventions . As we describe be - low , the epidemic model considers a homogeneous mixing approximation within each subpopulation ( i . e . comuna ) hence the only important variable is an estimate of contacts reduction rather than the actual contacts . To this end , contacts reduction is estimated by looking at the variation in the number of users co - located in the same antenna . Each antenna a in comuna j has a resident population N a j . On day t , the total number of visitors from the same comuna is v a j ( t ) . Assuming homogeneous mixing , the maximum number of contacts in antenna a is c a j ( t ) = (cid:0) N a j + v a j ( t ) (cid:1) × (cid:0) N a j + v a j ( t ) − 1 (cid:1) / 2 ∼ ( N a j + v a j ( t ) ) 2 / 2 . Then , we assume the reduction of contact during the partial and full lockdown to be equal to : r partiala j = avg 16 / 03 < t < 15 / 05 [ c a j ( t ) ] avg t < 16 / 03 [ c a j ( t ) ] r fulla j = avg t > 15 / 05 [ c a j ( t ) ] avg t < 16 / 03 [ c a j ( t ) ] ( 1 ) In other words , the reduction of contacts during the partial and full lockdown is considered as the variation of the maximum number of contacts before and after each intervention . Finally , we aggregate at the level of comunas taking the median of these quantities over all antennas located in the same comuna . 4 . 2 Modeling the spread of COVID - 19 in Santiago The model used in this work to simulate the spread of COVID - 19 is largely inspired by the Global Epidemic and Mobility Model ( GLEAM ) [ 35 , 36 ] . In this section , we present the conceptual framework but a full mathematical description is provided in the Supplementary Information . The comunas of Santiago are represented as single subpopulations in a metapopulation network . Inside each one , we divide individuals into K = 16 ﬁve - year age brackets respecting the demographic of diﬀerent comunas [ 37 ] and we use the country - speciﬁc contact matrix from Ref . [ 38 ] to deﬁne the rates at which diﬀerent age groups mix with each other . Individuals are also divided into compartments according to their health status . We consider a SLIR ( Susceptible , Latent , Infectious , Removed ) com - partmentalization setup . A similar approach has been used in several modeling studies in the context of COVID - 19 [ 7 , 39 , 40 ] . Interacting with Infectious , Susceptibles move to the Latent stage in which they are not infectious yet . Only after the incubation period , Latent become Infectious . Lastly , Infectious transit to the Removed compartment at a rate inversely proportional to the infectious period . Individuals can get the infection interacting with infected in their home and in other connected metapopulations . To model this aspect , we consider the commuting network previously introduced to 8 .

Technically , we deﬁne a “force of infection” λ kj that expresses the infection rate for individuals in age group k residing in comuna j : λ kj = λ kjj 1 + σ j / τ + (cid:88) i λ kji σ ji / τ 1 + σ j / τ ( 2 ) Where τ set the time scale of commuting ( here τ − 1 = 1 / 3 day ) and σ j = (cid:80) i σ ji is the total commuting rate of population j . In particular , the ﬁrst term in Eq . 2 represents the contribute from active infec - tions in comuna j , and the summation from cases in other connected comunas i ( see Supplementary Information for full details ) . Government interventions are implemented by changing the commuting network on 16 / 03 ( partial lockdown commuting ) and again on 15 / 05 ( full lockdown commuting ) to reﬂect the corresponding vari - ations in mobility . Similarly , on these dates , we multiply the age contact matrix of each comuna by r partialj and r fullj , respectively . We do not explicitly account for school closure since its eﬀect is already included into the changes inferred from mobile devices data . The model is fully stochastic and transitions among compartments are simulated through chain binomial processes . In the main text we present results for an incubation period of 4 days and an infectious period of 2 . 5 days , which imply a generation time T G = 6 . 5 days , in line with current estimates [ 41 , 42 ] . We simulate deaths considering the estimates of the Infection Fatality Rate from Ref . [ 19 ] and a delay ∆ after the transition to the Removed compartment . Initial seeding is done using the projections of active cases on March 1 st , 2020 in the Metropolitan area of Santiago from Ref . [ 7 ] and assigning infections to diﬀerent comunas proportionally to the population distribution . The calibration is performed on weekly deaths using an Approximate Bayesian Computation ( ABC ) Rejection method [ 12 , 13 ] . At each step of the ABC algorithm , a set of parameters θ is sampled from a prior distribution and an instance of the model is generated using these parameters . Then , an output quantity E (cid:48) of the model is compared to the corresponding real quantity E using a distance measure s ( E (cid:48) , E ) . If this distance is greater ( smaller ) than a predeﬁned tolerance (cid:15) , then the sampled set of parameters is discarded ( retained ) . After a suﬃcient number of iterations , the distribution of accepted sets will approximate the posterior distribution of parameters P ( θ , E ) given the evidence E from the data . In this work , we set a ﬂat uniform prior on the parameters ( R 0 ∈ [ 2 , 4 ] in steps of 0 . 02 and ∆ ∈ [ 14 , 21 ] days in steps of 1 day ) and we perform calibration using the median absolute percentage error as a distance metric with a tolerance of 20 % on weekly deaths . We run 140 , 000 iterations which correspond to about 200 stochastic realizations for each possible parameters set . We use the oﬃcial data issued by the Department of Statistics of the Chilean Minister of Health [ 43 ] . We consider both COVID - 19 ”conﬁrmed” and ”suspected” deaths to perform the calibration , in the Supplementary Information we support this decision showing that considering only conﬁrmed COVID - 19 deaths we still obtain a signiﬁcant anomaly in mortality . Model projections are produced sampling parameter sets directly from the posterior distribution and generating an ensemble of trajectories . In this work we generate model estimates sampling 5 , 000 sets on which we compute median and conﬁdence intervals . Acknowledgements .

Deaths Data for Calibration . We calibrate the model using COVID - 19 deaths data issued by the Department of Statistics of the Chilean Minister of Health ( DEIS ) [ 43 ] . The dataset includes both ”conﬁrmed” ( i . e . supported by a clinical test , ICD code : U07 . 1 ) and ”suspected” deaths ( i . e . supported only by symptoms , ICD code : U07 . 2 ) . In Fig . 4A we compare 2020 all - cause deaths with historical median and 95 % conﬁdence intervals . We observe that , excluding only COVID - 19 conﬁrmed from 2020 deaths we still obtain a signiﬁcant anomaly . Excluding also suspected , instead , we obtain a trend that is within conﬁdence intervals . For this reason , we decide to calibrate the model considering both COVID - 19 conﬁrmed and suspected deaths . Here , we perform also calibration considering only conﬁrmed COVID - 19 deaths . In Fig . 4B we ob - serve that the estimates for R 0 obtained in this case do not change signiﬁcantly ( median R 0 of 2 . 58 , 95 % CI : [ 2 . 50 , 2 . 64 ] ) . Moreover , this approach leads to a worse ﬁt of the data ( median absolute percentage error of 28 % with respect to the 12 % obtained considering also suspected deaths ) . Figure 4 : Impact of COVID - 19 on mortality rate in Santiago . A ) We plot 2020 all - cause weekly deaths in the comunas of Santiago and the historical median with 95 % conﬁdence interval computed on 2010 - 2019 data . We report also 2020 deaths time series excluding only COVID - 19 conﬁrmed ( ICD code : U07 . 1 ) and also suspected ( ICD code : U07 . 2 ) deaths . B ) R 0 estimates considering only conﬁrmed and also suspected COVID - 19 deaths . Incubation and Infectious Period . In the main text we considered an incubation period ( T IC ) of 4 days and an infectious period ( T IF ) of 2 . 5 days . Here , we run simulations where we vary these param - eters and we observe the impact on our ﬁndings . In particular , we consider estimated R 0 , prevalence and increase in deaths without the full lockdown for longer incubation ( T IC ∈ [ 5 , 6 ] days ) and infectious periods ( T IF ∈ [ 3 , 3 . 5 ] days ) . In Fig . 5 we represent results of the sensitivity analysis . From Fig . 5A we observe that the median R 0 for the diﬀerent parameters explored remains in the range [ 2 , 3 ] . Also , from Fig . 5B we note that the median projected prevalence as of August 1 , 2020 in Santiago varies of at most 5 . 9 % . Finally , the results of the counterfactual analysis in which we do not introduce the full lockdown are very robust across diﬀerent parameters explored . Indeed , the median projected increase in deaths as of August 1 , 2020 varies of at most 3 . 0 % . Mobility and Sociodemographics . In the main text , we showed that the change in commuting correlates with the Human Development Index ( HDI ) of diﬀerent comunas . Here , we show that this pattern holds for other economic and development indicators too . In particular , we consider separately the components of the HDI , namely the Life Expectancy Index ( LEI ) , the Education Index ( EI ) , and the 14 .

B ) Model projections of prevalence in Santiago as of August 1 , 2020 for diﬀerent parameters . C ) Increase in deaths ( in percentage ) as of August 1 , 2020 without the full lockdown for diﬀerent parameters . Income Index ( II ) [ 10 ] . In Fig . 6 we see that the correlation between these indicators and the average commuting drop after 16 / 03 of the 37 comunas considered is still high , signiﬁcant , and consistent with the results presented in the main text for the HDI . Figure 6 : Correlation between mobility and sociodemographics . We represent the scatter plot and the correlations between average percentage drop in commuting after 16 / 03 and the Life Expectancy Index ( LEI ) , the Education Index ( EI ) , and the Income Index ( II ) . Also , in the main text we showed the signiﬁcant correlation between HDI and the average percentage decrease in commuting after March 16 th , 2020 . Here , we show that this ﬁnding hold also for absolute commuting decreases . This sensitivity check is needed since a higher percentage decrease does not im - ply necessarily a lower mobility after the introduction of NPIs ( for example , the mobility baseline of wealthier comunas can be generally higher ) . We deﬁne the outﬂow as the average number of outgoing travels per device observed for a comuna during a given period . In Fig . 7 we represent ( left ) the outﬂow before March 16 th , 2020 versus the HDI of diﬀerent comunas . We observe no signiﬁcant correlation ( ρ = 0 . 01 , p = 0 . 94 ) . On the right , instead we represent the scatter plot of the absolute reduction in 15 .

In this case we ﬁnd a strong , positive , and signiﬁcant correlation ( ρ = 0 . 55 , p < 0 . 0001 ) , hinting that wealthier comunas reduced more their mobility also in absolute terms . Figure 7 : HDI and absolute mobility changes . On the left , scatter plot of outﬂow ( normalized ) before March 16 th , 2020 versus HDI of diﬀerent comunas . On the right , scatter plot of the absolute reduction in outﬂow after March 16 th , 2020 , versus HDI of diﬀerent comunas . Points size is scaled according to population . Projected cases . In the main text , we assessed the performance of the model comparing via the Kendall rank correlation coeﬃcient the number of days ( since 2020 / 01 / 01 ) needed to reach 200 infections in diﬀerent comunas according to our projections and oﬃcial surveillance . We found a good , signiﬁcant correlation and we remarked that dates estimated through modeling were generally earlier to those oﬃcially reported . In Fig . 8 is shown that this pattern holds also for diﬀerent numbers of infections . In particular , we consider the amount of days needed to reach 50 , 100 , 200 , and 500 infections . B Homogeneous NPIs Eﬀect - Counterfactual Scenario In the main text we present a hypothetical scenario in which we assign to all comunas the average decrease in commuting rates and contacts observed after the partial lockdown for the 4 th quartile of HDI ( i . e . 25 % comunas with higher HDI ) . In Fig . 9A we represent the percentage change in total COVID - 19 deaths and cases as of 2020 / 05 / 15 , date of the 2 nd lockdown . We observe that the eﬀect on the spreading is signiﬁcant : - 83 . 8 % ( 95 % CI : [ - 77 . 6 % , - 88 . 6 % ] ) fewer cases and - 70 . 5 % ( 95 % CI : [ - 55 . 0 % , - 80 . 9 % ] ) fewer deaths . In Fig . 9B we represent the percentage change in COVID - 19 cases as of May 15 th in diﬀerent comunas . We observe that , in general , the uniform reduction in mobility and contacts brings beneﬁts also to comunas with higher HDI . This hints that a more equal distribution of behavioral responses to the NPIs in place would be advantageous not only for the most vulnerable but to the community as a whole . C Metapopulation Model with Age Structure The model presented here is largely based on Ref . [ 36 ] . We consider N populations and K age groups . We introduce the matrix C j ∈ R K × K whose element C jkk (cid:48) indicates the contacts rate between age group k and k (cid:48) in population j . Similarly , we introduce the matrix Σ ∈ R N × N , whose element σ ji indicates the commuting rate from population j to i . We consider a SLIR compartmentalization setup with traveling Infectious , analogous to the case described in the main text ( Tab . 1 ) . In the following , we will use the notation X kji to indicate individual in age bracket k and compartment X living in population j and traveling to i . In these settings , we deﬁne the force of infection λ kj as the probability that a susceptible individual in age group k and in population j transit to the Latent compartment in the unit of time . This force of infection has two contributions , from the contacts occurred in the home population ( λ k jj ) and in other connected populations ( λ kji ) . These can be written down as : λ kjj = β N ∗ j (cid:34)(cid:88) k (cid:48) C jkk (cid:48) I k (cid:48) jj + (cid:88) i (cid:88) k (cid:48) C jkk (cid:48) I k (cid:48) ij (cid:35) ( 3 ) 16 .

We consider the number of days since 2020 / 01 / 01 needed to reach 50 , 100 , 200 , and 500 infections in diﬀerent comunas as projected by our model and as conﬁrmed by oﬃcial surveillance . λ kji = β N ∗ i (cid:34)(cid:88) k (cid:48) C ikk (cid:48) I k (cid:48) ii + (cid:88) l (cid:88) k (cid:48) C ikk (cid:48) I k (cid:48) li (cid:35) ( 4 ) Where β is the probability of becoming infected as a result of a single contact , and N ∗ j is the eﬀective number of individuals in population j ( more details below ) . To use these expressions , we need to substitute the equilibrium values for I k (cid:48) jj and I k (cid:48) ij . For a general compartment X , holds for consistency the following relation : X kj = X kjj ( t ) + (cid:88) i X kji ( t ) ( 5 ) For X k jj ( t ) and X k ji ( t ) we can write the following rate equations : d t X kjj = − (cid:88) i σ ji X kjj ( t ) + τ (cid:88) i X kji ( t ) ( 6 ) d t X kji = σ ji X kjj ( t ) − τX kji ( t ) ( 7 ) Where τ set the time scale of commuting ( results in the main text are obtained for τ − 1 = 1 / 3 day ) . From Eq . 5 we derive (cid:80) i X kji ( t ) = X kj − X kjj ( t ) . We substitute this expression in Eq . 6 and we deﬁne the total commuting rate of population j as σ j = (cid:80) i σ ji : d t X kjj = τX kj − ( σ j + τ ) X kjj ( t ) ( 8 ) We solve Eq . 8 for X kjj ( t ) : X kjj ( t ) = τX kj σ j + τ + (cid:34) X kjj ( 0 ) − τX kj σ j + τ (cid:35) e − ( σ j + τ ) t ( 9 ) 17 .

A ) Drop ( % ) in total number of COVID - 19 deaths and cases as of 2020 / 05 / 15 , date of the 2 nd lockdown . b ) Drop ( % ) in COVID - 19 cases in diﬀerent comunas . When t → ∞ , we obtain the equilibrium value : X kjj = X kj 1 + σ j / τ ( 10 ) We take Eq . 7 and we impose the equilibrium condition σ ji X kjj − τX kji = 0 . Then , substituting the result just derived , we obtain the equilibrium value also for X kji : X kji = X kj σ ji / τ 1 + σ j / τ ( 11 ) Therefore , substituting the equilibrium values in Eq . 3 and 4 we obtain : λ kjj = β N ∗ j (cid:34)(cid:88) k (cid:48) C jkk (cid:48) I k (cid:48) j 1 + σ j / τ + (cid:88) i (cid:88) k (cid:48) C jkk (cid:48) I k (cid:48) i σ ij / τ 1 + σ i / τ (cid:35) ( 12 ) 18 .

This eﬀective population must consider both the individual from j present in j and those traveling to j from connected populations i . Using the equilibrium values derived in Eq . 10 and Eq . 11 : N ∗ j = N j 1 + σ j / τ + (cid:88) i N i σ ij / τ 1 + σ i / τ ( 15 ) Mobility restrictions are implemented changing the commuting matrix Σ at the start of the partial and the full lockdown . Contacts reduction , instead , is implemented multiplying the contacts matrix C j of each population ( comunas ) by the respective parameter . For example , the general element of the contacts matrix C j during the partial lockdown for comuna j is r partialj C jkk (cid:48) . 19 .
