A secreted H . pylori toxin , VacA , can cause multiple alterations in gastric epithelial cells , including cell death . In this study , we sought to identify host cell factors that are required for VacA - induced cell death . To do this , we analyzed gene trap and short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) libraries in AZ - 521 human gastric epithelial cells and selected for VacA - resistant clones . Among the VacA - resistant clones , we identiﬁed multiple gene trap library clones and an shRNA library clone with disrupted expression of connexin 43 ( Cx43 ) ( also known as gap junction protein alpha 1 [ GJA1 ] ) . Fur - ther experiments with Cx43 - speciﬁc shRNAs conﬁrmed that a reduction in Cx43 expression results in resistance to VacA - in - duced cell death . Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy experiments indicated that VacA did not colocalize with Cx43 . We detected production of the Cx43 protein in AZ - 521 cells but not in AGS , HeLa , or RK - 13 cells , and correspondingly , AZ - 521 cells were the most susceptible to VacA - induced cell death . When Cx43 was expressed in HeLa cells , the cells became more susceptible to VacA . These results indicate that Cx43 is a host cell constituent that contributes to VacA - induced cell death and that variation among cell types in susceptibility to VacA - induced cell death is attributable at least in part to cell type - speciﬁc differences in Cx43 production . H elicobacter pylori is a Gram - negative bacterium that persis - tently colonizes about 50 % of the world’s population ( 1 , 2 ) . H . pylori colonization causes gastric inﬂammation in all infected individuals and is a risk factor for the development of peptic ulcer disease , gastric adenocarcinoma , and gastric lymphoma ( 3 , 4 ) . Gastric cancer is one of the most common infection - related can - cers and is the second leading cause of cancer - related death world - wide ( 5 , 6 ) . One of the important virulence factors produced by H . pylori is a secreted pore - forming toxin known as VacA ( 7 – 14 ) . VacA is produced as a 140 - kDa protoxin , which undergoes pro - teolytic processing to yield a signal peptide , passenger domain , and (cid:2) - barrel domain . The 88 - kDa toxin is secreted through a type V , or autotransporter , pathway ( 15 – 19 ) . Multiple types of cells are susceptible to VacA , including gas - tric epithelial cells and cells of the immune system ( 1 , 2 , 7 – 14 , 20 ) . As a ﬁrst step in VacA intoxication , the toxin binds to host cell receptors ( 7 , 9 ) . Multiple potential receptors have been identiﬁed , including sphingomyelin ( 21 , 22 ) , receptor protein - tyrosine phosphatases ( RPTP - (cid:3) and RPTP - (cid:2) ) ( 23 , 24 ) , and low - density lipoprotein receptor - related protein - 1 ( LRP1 ) ( 25 ) in gastric epi - thelial cells and integrin - (cid:2) 2 receptor ( CD18 ) in T cells ( 26 ) . After binding to cells , VacA can be internalized into cells through a pinocytotic process ( 27 ) . Internalized VacA ﬁrst accumulates in early endosomes and then trafﬁcs to late endosomes ( 27 – 29 ) and mitochondria ( 30 , 31 ) . There are many possible consequences of VacA interactions with epithelial cells , including cell vacuolation , disruption of endosomal and lysosomal function , depolarization of the plasma membrane potential , permeabilization of epithelial monolayers , detachment of epithelial cells from the basement membrane , autophagy , and cell death ( 7 – 14 , 20 , 32 – 34 ) . VacA can cause death of gastric epithelial cells through both apoptosis and programmed cell necrosis ( 14 , 20 , 35 – 37 ) . The mechanisms by which VacA causes cell death are not yet completely understood but are thought to be dependent on local - ization of VacA to mitochondria ( 30 , 38 – 40 ) . Effects of VacA on mitochondria include reduction in mitochondrial transmem - brane potential , cytochrome c release , and mitochondrial network fragmentation ( 30 , 38 – 40 , 41 – 43 ) , which can lead to poly ( ADP - ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) cleavage , reduction of cellular ATP content , and impaired cell cycle progression ( 9 , 35 , 41 – 43 ) . The proapoptotic factors BAX and BAK , as well as dynamin - related protein 1 ( Drp1 ) , have roles in VacA - mediated cell death ( 31 , 42 , 44 ) . VacA can cause cell death in several cell lines , including HeLa ( 30 , 38 , 39 , 45 ) , AGS ( 20 , 36 , 37 , 41 , 46 ) , and AZ - 521 cells ( 25 , 35 , 42 , 44 , 47 ) , but among these cell types , AZ - 521 cells are the most susceptible to VacA - mediated killing ( 35 ) . The molecular mech - anisms underlying this enhanced susceptibility of AZ - 521 cells are not understood . In the current study , we analyzed gene trap and shRNA librar - ies in AZ - 521 cells , selected for VacA - resistant clones , and thereby sought to identify host cell factors that are required for VacA - induced death of these cells . We report here that connexin 43 ( Cx43 ) is a host cell factor that contributes to VacA - induced cell death in AZ - 521 cells . Connexins are components of gap junc - tions , which form intercellular channels between adjacent cells . These channels provide a route for diffusion of low - molecular - weight molecules from cell to cell and play an important role in Received 5 July 2013 Returned for modiﬁcation 5 August 2013 Accepted 1 November 2013 Published ahead of print 4 November 2013 Editor : B .

Therefore , connexins regulate many physiological processes . Cx43 is the most common con - nexin isoform and is expressed by many different cell types , in - cluding gastric and intestinal epithelial cells ( 49 – 51 ) , ventricular myocytes , astrocytes , muscle cells , endothelial cells ( 52 – 54 ) , and several types of immune cells ( including T and B cells , neutro - phils , mast cells , monocytes , and macrophages ) ( 55 – 60 ) . We re - port that Cx43 is produced by AZ - 521 cells but not by several other cell types that are commonly used for studies of VacA and provide evidence that variation among cell types in susceptibility to VacA - induced cell death is attributable at least in part to cell type - speciﬁc differences in Cx43 protein production . MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and culture conditions . H . pylori wild - type ( WT ) strain 60190 ( ATCC 49503 ) and an isogenic mutant expressing VacA - G14A , a mutant toxin that is defective in membrane channel formation and does not cause cell death ( 35 , 61 ) , were grown on Trypticase soy agar plates containing 5 % sheep blood at 37°C in ambient air containing 5 % CO 2 . H . pylori liquidculturesweregrowninBrucellabrothsupplementedwith5 % fetalbovineserum ( FBS ) ( AtlantaBiologicals ) or0 . 5 % activatedcharcoal . H . pylori brothculturesupernatantsandpuriﬁcationofVacA . VacA was puriﬁed from culture supernatant of H . pylori strain 60190 as de - scribed previously ( 62 ) , and puriﬁed VacA was acid activated before add - ing it to cultured cells ( 62 ) . For experiments using H . pylori broth culture supernatant ( derived from cultures in Brucella broth containing FBS ) , supernatants were concentrated 30 - fold by ultraﬁltration with a 30 - kDa - cutoff membrane . The relative concentrations of VacA in broth culture supernatants from WT and mutant H . pylori strains were determined by Western blotting using rabbit anti - VacA antiserum ( 33 ) , and the concen - trations of VacA in individual preparations were then normalized . A rel - ative VacA concentration of 1 corresponds to a 1 : 1 , 600 dilution of the concentrated WT H . pylori broth culture supernatant . The culture super - natants containing normalized concentrations of VacA were diluted in cell culture medium , and serial dilutions were added to cultured cells . Cell culture . AZ - 521 human gastric adenocarcinoma cells ( derived from human gastric cancer tissue ; Culture Collection of Health Science Resource Bank , Japan Health Science Foundation ) , HeLa cells ( derived from a human cervical adenocarcinoma ; ATCC CCL - 2 ) , and RK13 rabbit kidney cells ( derived from normal rabbit kidney ; ATCC CCL - 37 ) were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10 % FBS ( At - lanta Biologicals ) and 1 mM nonessential amino acids , and AGS human gastric epithelial cells ( derived from a human gastric adenocarcinoma ; ATCC CRL1739 ) were grown in RPMI medium containing 10 % FBS , 2 mM L - glutamine , and 10 mM HEPES buffer . Generationofagenetraplibrary . Toconstructagenetraplibrary , the U3neoSV1 retrovirus vector ( 63 ) was obtained from Zirus , Inc . ( Buford , GA ) , and AZ - 521 cells were infected for 1 h with U3neoSV1 at a multi - plicity of infection ( MOI ) of 0 . 1 in the presence of 4 (cid:4) g / ml of Polybrene ( Sigma ) , a cationic polymer used to increase the infection efﬁciency . The medium was subsequently changed , and the cells were grown overnight . One day later , cells were exposed to the antibiotic G418 ( 0 . 375 mg / ml ) ( Research Products International Corp . ) to select for cells containing the U3neo cassette . Generation of an shRNA library . To generate an shRNA library in AZ - 521 cells , a pooled Decode RNAi - GIPZ annotated gene screening li - brary ( positive selection kit ; Open Biosystems ) packaged in a lentivirus vector was added to AZ - 521 cells at an MOI of 0 . 3 . Cells were incubated for 3 days and then exposed to puromycin ( 5 (cid:4) g / ml ) to select for cells containing the shRNA . Analysis of gene trap library and identiﬁcation of targeted genes . Gene trap library cells were incubated 2 times with 10 (cid:4) g / ml of puriﬁed acid - activated VacA ( twice the concentration required to kill AZ - 521 cells [ 35 ] ) in the presence of 10 mM ammonium chloride for 24 h each , and surviving cells were picked as single - cell clones . Surviving cells were sub - sequently analyzed in a secondary screen to test whether they exhibited resistance to VacA - containing H . pylori broth culture supernatant in comparison to parental control cells . Clones that exhibited signiﬁcantly increased survival compared to parental control cells were then analyzed further . To identify the genes that were disrupted in VacA - resistant gene trap library clones that passed the secondary screen , genomic DNA was iso - lated from the cells using a QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi kit ( Qiagen ) . Shut - tle vectors and genomic DNA ﬂanking the integration site were then recovered by digesting the genomic DNA with EcoRI or BamHI , self - ligating , transforming into Escherichia coli , and selecting on LB agar con - taining 100 (cid:4) g / ml of carbenicillin ( Sigma ) . Individual colonies were am - pliﬁed , and recovered genomic DNAs were sequenced using primers that anneal to the gene trap shuttle vector . Sequences were analyzed by the RepeatMasker web server followed by nucleotide - nucleotide BLAST searches against the NCBI databases . Analysis of shRNA library and identiﬁcation of targeted genes . shRNA library cells were incubated 2 times with 10 (cid:4) g / ml of puriﬁed acid - activatedVacAinthepresenceof10mMammoniumchloridefor24 heach , andsurvivingcellswerepickedassingle - cellclones . Survivingcells were subsequently analyzed in a secondary screen to test whether they exhibited resistance to VacA - containing H . pylori broth culture superna - tant in comparison to parental control cells . Clones that exhibited a sig - niﬁcantly increased survival compared to that of parental control cells were subsequently analyzed to identify the targeted genes . To identify the shRNA that was expressed in VacA - resistant shRNA library clones that passed the secondary screen , genomic DNA was isolated from the cells using the Wizard genomic DNA puriﬁcation kit ( Promega ) , and the shRNA was PCR ampliﬁed and sequenced . Cell viability assays . For cell viability assays , cells ( AZ - 521 , HeLa , RK13 , and AGS ) were seeded at 4 (cid:5) 10 4 cells / well into 96 - well plates and incubated overnight . Cells were then incubated with serial dilutions of H . pylori broth culture supernatants containing WT VacA or VacA - G14A in the presence of 10 mM ammonium chloride . Cell viability was assessed using the CellTiterAQ ueous One Solution cell proliferation assay ( Pro - mega ) or the ATPlite 1 - step assay ( PerkinElmer ) according to the manu - facturer’s instructions . WesternblotanalysisofCx43 . Cells ( AZ - 521 , HeLa , RK13 , andAGS ) were seeded at 7 (cid:5) 10 5 cells / well into 6 - well plates and incubated over - night . Cells were lysed in CelLyticM cell lysis reagent ( Sigma ) . Expression of Cx43 was assessed by Western blotting using a rabbit anti - Cx43 anti - body ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; abcam ) followed by a horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibody ( 1 : 10 , 000 ; Promega ) . Expression of (cid:2) - actin or glyc - eraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) was monitored using anti - (cid:2) - actin and anti - GAPDH antibodies ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; abcam ) to ensure equal loading . Proteins were visualized by incubation with a chemilumi - nescent substrate solution ( Pierce ) and exposure to ﬁlm . Inhibition of Cx43 expression . AZ - 521 cells were transduced with lentivirus particles expressing either nontargeting ( NT ) shRNA or two different Cx43 - speciﬁc shRNAs ( Cx43 shRNA 83010 and Cx43 shRNA 83012 ) ( Open Biosystems ) at an MOI of 12 . Cells were incubated for 3 days and then exposed to puromycin ( 5 (cid:4) g / ml ) to select for cells contain - ing the shRNA . Cx43 protein expression was analyzed by Western blot - ting . Analysis of VacA localization and Cx43 localization . To analyze the interactions of VacA with control AZ - 521 cells compared to results with cells that expressed Cx43 - speciﬁc shRNA , puriﬁed VacA was labeled with Alexa 488 ( Molecular Probes ) according to the manufacturer’s instruc - tions . AZ - 521 cells expressing NT shRNA , Cx43 shRNA 83010 , or Cx43 shRNA 83012 were seeded at 4 (cid:5) 10 4 cells / well into 8 - well culture slides ( BD Biosciences ) and incubated overnight . Cells were then incubated with 5 (cid:4) g / ml of acid - treated Alexa 488 - labeled VacA in the presence of 10 mM ammonium chloride at 37°C for 1 h .

Cells were viewed with a 710 confocal laser scanning microscope ( Carl Zeiss ) . Con - focal laser scanning micrographs were collected at 0 . 66 - (cid:4) m intervals in the Z plane , and the image stacks were displayed using the ortho slice function of the Zen 2010 software program . The Z - stack images were also used to digitally render three - dimensional ( 3D ) and 4D images using the Zen 2010 software package . The localization of Cx43 in HeLa cells was analyzed using the same approach . Expression of Cx43 in HeLa cells . HeLa cells were transduced with lentivirus particles encoding human Cx43 or with negative - control Len - tifect lentivirus particles ( GeneCopoeia ) at an MOI of 5 . Cells were incu - bated for 3 days and then exposed to 5 (cid:4) g / ml puromycin to select for transduced cells . RESULTS Analysis of gene trap and shRNA libraries . In this study , we sought to identify cellular factors that are required for VacA - in - duced death of gastric epithelial cells . To accomplish this goal , we generated a gene trap library in AZ - 521 cells by infecting cells with a replication - deﬁcient retrovirus vector containing a promoter - less neomycin resistance gene . Insertion of the gene trap vector into an actively transcribed region of the genome results in a neo - mycin - resistant phenotype . Selection of neomycin - resistant cells results in a library of cells containing random insertions of the gene trap vector in the host genome and disrupted expression of the genes into which the vector has inserted . We incubated the AZ - 521 gene trap library with puriﬁed VacA , as described in Ma - terials and Methods . Surviving cells were picked as single - cell clones , expanded , and tested in secondary screens to conﬁrm that they were resistant to VacA . We then analyzed the sites of gene trap vector insertion in 65 VacA - resistant clones to determine which genes had been disrupted . There was a high level of redun - dancy among the VacA - resistant clones that were identiﬁed ( i . e . , many of the same clones were detected multiple times ) , which provided evidence that a reasonably complete set of the VacA - resistant clones in this library had been identiﬁed . In total , we identiﬁed 17 distinct VacA - resistant clones ( Table 1 ) . In three cases , the same gene was disrupted by gene trap vector insertion into multiple distinct sites ; thus , 14 different genes were disrupted in the VacA - resistant cells ( Table 1 ) . As a complementary approach , we introduced an shRNA li - brary into AZ - 521 cells . To generate the shRNA library , pools of shRNAs targeting human genes were introduced into the cells by lentivirus transduction . The shRNAs integrate randomly into the genome , and small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) targeting human TABLE 1 Genes identiﬁed in gene trap library screen a Genesymbol b Gene or product name Alternate name ( s ) DLGAP1 Discs , large ( Drosophila ) homolog - associated protein 1 DAP - 1 , GKAP , SAPAP1 EFHA2 EF - hand domain family , member A2 MICU3 EIF1 Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1 A121 , EIF - 1 , EIFIA , ISO1 , SUI1 FMN1 Formin 1 DKFZP686C2281 , MGC125288 , MGC125289 GAS5 Growth arrest - speciﬁc 5 NCRNA00030 , SNHG2 GJA1 Gap junction protein alpha 1 , 43 kDa Cx43 , ODD , ODOD , SDTY3 KITL Kit ligand FPH2 , KL - 1 , SCF , SF KLHL14 Kelch - like 14 KIAA1384 MALAT1 Metastasis - associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 NCRNA00047 , NEAT2 , PRO1073 PARM1 Prostate androgen - regulated transcript 1 CIPAR1 , DKFZP64O0823 , WSC4 RCC1 Regulator of chromosome condensation 1 None SNORD58B Small nucleolar RNA , C / D box 58B U58B SNORD76 Small nucleolar RNA , C / D box 76 U76 TGF (cid:2) 2 Transforming growth factor (cid:2) 2 None a Multiple independent clones , each with a different site of gene trap vector insertion into the same gene , were identiﬁed in three cases .

We incubated a portion of the library with puri - ﬁed VacA , as described in Materials and Methods . Surviving cells were picked as single - cell clones , expanded , tested in secondary screens to conﬁrm that they were resistant to VacA , and then analyzed to identify the shRNAs present in the resistant clones . A total of 25 VacA - resistant shRNA library clones were identiﬁed , andtherewasnoredundancyinthegenesthatweretargetedbytheshRNAsintheseclones . We identiﬁed only one gene , the gap junction protein alpha 1 gene ( GJA1 or Cx43 ; here designated Cx43 ) , that was targeted in both the VacA - resistant gene trap clones and the VacA - resistant shRNA clones . Secondary screens conﬁrmed that these clones originating with the gene trap library or the shRNA library exhib - ited increased resistance to VacA in comparison to results for con - trol parental cells ( Fig . 1B ) . Among the VacA - resistant gene trap clones , there were three independent sites of gene trap vector in - sertion into the Cx43 gene ( Fig . 1A ) , and all three insertions oc - curred within the Cx43 exon . Therefore , we conducted further experiments to investigate a potential role of Cx43 in VacA - in - duced cell death . RoleofCx43inVacA - inducedcelldeath . Tofurthervalidatea role of Cx43 in VacA - induced cell death , we transduced parental AZ - 521 cells with lentivirus particles expressing either nontarget - ing ( NT ) shRNA or two different Cx43 - speciﬁc shRNAs ( Cx43 shRNA83010andCx43shRNA83012 ) , andcellsstablyexpressing the shRNAs were selected , as described in Materials and Methods . The sequence of Cx43 shRNA 83012 ( 5 = - GGTGCATGTTGGTAT TTAA ) was identical to that which was present in the VacA - resis - tant clone selected from the shRNA library , but the sequence of shRNA 83010 ( 5 = - CCAATATGGTGTTTACATT ) was distinct . Western blot analysis showed reduced production of Cx43 in cells expressing Cx43 shRNA compared to that in cells expressing NT shRNA ( Fig . 2A ) . We then incubated the AZ - 521 cells expressing either Cx43 - speciﬁc shRNA ( 83010 and 83012 ) or NT shRNA with culture supernatants containing wild - type ( WT ) VacA or VacA - G14A , a mutant toxin that is defective in membrane chan - nel formation ( 61 ) . Cells expressing either Cx43 shRNA 83010 or Cx43 shRNA 83012 exhibited resistance to WT VacA compared to cells expressing NT shRNA ( Fig . 2B to E ) . These experiments con - ﬁrmed that a reduction in Cx43 protein expression confers resis - tance to VacA - induced cell killing . FIG 2 Inhibition of Cx43 expression increases cellular resistance to VacA toxicity . ( A ) AZ - 521 cells were transduced with lentivirus particles encoding nontargeting ( NT ) shRNA or two different Cx43 - speciﬁc shRNAs ( 83010 and 83012 ) , and cells stably expressing the shRNAs were selected . Expression of the Cx43 protein was analyzed by Western blotting using an anti - Cx43 antibody . Expression of (cid:2) - actin was monitored to ensure equal loading . The effect of shRNA treatment on Cx43 production was evaluated by densitometry . Cx43 expression was decreased in Cx43 shRNA - expressing cells compared to that in cells expressingNTshRNA .

VacA bound to cells expressingCx43 - speciﬁcshRNA , similartothebindingofVacAto cells expressing NT shRNA ( Fig . 3A to C ) . To determine whether VacA colocalized with Cx43 , we analyzed the localization of both proteins using confocal laser scanning microscopy . As expected , Cx43 was detected mainly at the junctions between cells , and this result was conﬁrmed by optical sectioning and analysis of image stacks using the ortho slice function , as well as by analysis of 3D images ( data not shown ) . VacA was also detected on the surfaces of cells but was not detected primarily at cell junctions . Moreover , we did not detect colocalization of VacA with Cx43 ( Fig . 3D and E ) . Collectively , the results shown in Fig . 3 provide evidence that Cx43 is not the primary receptor for VacA in these cells . Analysis of Cx43 protein expression in multiple gastric cell lines . We previously reported that AZ - 521 cells are more suscep - tible to VacA - induced cell death than are AGS cells ( 35 ) . Cx43 expression is often lost in tumor cells during tumor development ( 64 – 67 ) , and therefore , we hypothesized that the differential sen - sitivityofAZ - 521andAGScellsmightcorrelatewithdifferencesin Cx43expression . ToinvestigatetheexpressionofCx43incelllines that are commonly used for studies of VacA and determine whether levels of Cx43 protein expression correlated with in - creased VacA susceptibility , we analyzed Cx43 protein expression in several epithelial cell lines of diverse tissue origin by Western blotting . Speciﬁcally , we tested AZ - 521 cells ( derived from human gastric cancer tissue ) , AGS cells ( derived from a human gastric adenocarcinoma ) , HeLa cells ( derived from a human cervical ad - enocarcinoma ) , and RK13 cells ( derived from normal rabbit kid - ney ) . We detected Cx43 production in AZ - 521 cells but did not detect Cx43 production in AGS , HeLa , or RK13 cells ( Fig . 4A ) . Correspondingly , among these cell types , AZ - 521 cells were the most susceptible to VacA - induced killing ( Fig . 4B to E ) . We hypothesized that cells not expressing Cx43 might become more susceptible to VacA - induced cell death if they produced Cx43 . To test this hypothesis , we transduced HeLa cells with len - tivirus particles containing Cx43 or a control lentivirus , and we selected for transduced cells , as described in Materials and Meth - ods . Western blot analysis showed that Cx43 was produced by HeLa - Cx43 cells but not HeLa - control cells ( Fig . 5A ) . The level of Cx43 protein produced by HeLa - Cx43 cells was substantially lower ( about 6 - fold less based on densitometry ) than that pro - duced by AZ - 521 cells . Despite the relatively low level of Cx43 production in the HeLa - Cx43 cells , these cells exhibited an in - creased susceptibility to VacA - induced cell death compared to that of HeLa - control cells ( Fig . 5B and C ) . We also examined the localization of Cx43 in HeLa - Cx43 cells compared to that in HeLa - control cells and AZ - 521 cells by confocal microscopy . In agreement with the Western blot results , confocal microscopy showed that Cx43 was produced by AZ - 521 and HeLa - Cx43 but not HeLa - control cells , and the level of Cx43 protein production was lower in HeLa - Cx43 cells than in AZ - 521 cells ( Fig . 6A to C ) . FIG 3 Analysis of VacA and Cx43 localization .

Collec - tively , these results demonstrate that the susceptibility of cells to VacA - induced cell death correlates with the levels of Cx43 protein production . DISCUSSION Oneoftheimportantvirulencefactorsproducedby H . pylori isthe vacuolating toxin VacA ( 7 – 14 ) . Several host cell factors are known to be required for VacA - induced cellular alterations . These in - clude cell surface receptors ( e . g . , sphingomyelin , RPTP (cid:3) , RPTP (cid:2) , low - density lipoprotein [ LDL ] receptor - related protein 1 [ LRP - 1 ] , and (cid:2) 2 integrin ) ( 21 – 26 ) , host cell factors required for VacA internalization and trafﬁcking ( dynamin and Rab7 ) , and host fac - tors involved in processes that are perturbed by VacA ( e . g . , Bax , Bak , Drp1 , and the vacuolar ATPase ) ( 7 – 14 , 27 – 29 , 38 , 39 , 42 , 44 ) . Nearly all of the previously identiﬁed host cell factors required for VacA action were discovered either by testing speciﬁc hypotheses about whether a known factor contributed to VacA action or by using biochemical approaches to identify proteins that interact with VacA . In the current study , we used insertional mutagenesis using gene entrapment ( gene trap ) and shRNA libraries as system - atic unbiased approaches to identify host cell factors that are re - quired for VacA - induced cell death . Several previous studies have suggested that the use of hypo - diploid cell lines facilitates gene trap selections ( 68 , 69 ) . However , the ﬁndings in the current study and several other studies indicate that gene trap selections can be used successfully in diploid or hyperdiploid cell lines ( 70 – 73 ) . We identiﬁed VacA - resistant clones with disrupted expression of Cx43 in both gene trap library and shRNA library experiments , and therefore , we analyzed the role of this host cell protein in further depth . In addition to iden - tifying VacA - resistant clones with disrupted expression of Cx43 , we also identiﬁed VacA - resistant gene trap clones with disrup - tions of 13 other genes ( Table 1 ) . Further studies will be required to validate a role of these other genes in the cellular actions of VacA and to determine by what mechanisms they contribute to VacA activity . Connexins are components of gap junctions , which are impor - tant for many physiological processes ( 74 , 75 ) . Gap junctions are comprised of two hexameric structures , known as hemichannels or connexons , with one hemichannel originating from each of two adjacent cells . Each connexon is comprised of six individual con - nexin subunits ( 54 , 76 – 78 ) . Direct intercellular communication FIG 4 AZ - 521 cells express Cx43 and are more susceptible to VacA than are celllinesthatdonotexpressCx43 . ( A ) Cx43expressioninAZ - 521 , HeLa , AGS , and RK13 cells was evaluated by Western blotting using an anti - Cx43 anti - body . Production of GAPDH was monitored to ensure equal loading . ( B to E ) AZ - 521 , HeLa , AGS , and RK13 cells were incubated with serial dilutions of H . pylori broth culture supernatants containing WT VacA or VacA - G14A ( an inactive mutant protein ) for 24 h , and cell viability was determined by the ATPliteassay .

Gap junction proteins ( and Cx43 in particular ) can regulate cell death and survival , cell growth , and cell differentiation through several mechanisms , which are either dependent or independent of channel activity ( 79 – 83 ) . Cx43 has been localized not only to gap junctions but also to intracellular sites , including mitochondria ( 48 , 76 , 79 , 80 , 84 ) . In the current study , we demonstrated by multiple approaches that Cx43 contributes to VacA - induced cell death in AZ - 521 cells . Speciﬁcally , analysis of a gene trap library yielded multiple inde - pendent VacA - resistant clones that all harbored gene trap vector insertions in Cx43 , and analysis of an shRNA library also yielded a VacA - resistant clone in which expression of Cx43 was targeted . SubsequentshRNAexperimentsvalidatedtheresultsofthelibraryanalyses , and the production of Cx43 in HeLa cells ( which ordi - narily fail to produce Cx43 ) conferred increased susceptibility to VacA - induced cell death . AZ - 521 cells in which Cx43 expression was inhibited remained susceptible to high concentrations of VacA ; this may be attributable to incomplete knockdown of Cx43 expression . We did not detect colocalization of VacA with Cx43 , which suggests that VacA - induced cell death does not depend on a direct interaction between VacA and Cx43 . Cx43 can potentially contribute to VacA - induced cell death through multiple mechanisms , including leakage of cellular con - stituents through Cx43 hemichannels , intracellular actions of Cx43 , or Cx43 - dependent paracrine signaling between cells ( 48 , 76 , 79 , 80 , 84 ) . Previous publications have provided evidence in - dicating that Cx43 can cause cell death through each of these mechanisms ( 79 , 80 , 85 – 87 ) . We have shown previously that in - cubation of Cx43 - expressing gastric epithelial cells with VacA re - sults in a reduction of cellular ATP content ( 35 ) , and this reduc - tion in ATP content could occur at least in part by release of ATP through connexin 43 channels ( 88 ) . Another possibility is that VacA alters Cx43 - dependent signaling cascades . Cx43 plays a ma - jor role in regulating intracellular Ca 2 (cid:8) levels and cell volume ( 76 ) , which are both relevant determinants of cell survival and cell death ( 89 ) and previously were shown to be altered in VacA - treated cells ( 35 , 90 , 91 ) . Furthermore , Cx43 - dependent intercel - lular communication through gap junctions can have a role in the spread of cell death signals between neighboring cells ( 80 , 92 , 93 ) , involving the use of Ca 2 (cid:8) , cAMP , cGMP , and ATP as candidate messengers ( 80 , 94 ) . Further experiments will be necessary to de - termine which of these molecular actions of Cx43 are most rele - vant in VacA - induced cell death . We examined several cultured cell lines for expression of Cx43 and observed that among the cell lines tested , AZ - 521 cells were the only cells that expressed detectable levels of the Cx43 protein . These ﬁndings are consistent with the results of previous studies , which reported that HeLa cells ( 64 , 65 ) , as well as many other cultured human cell lines and human cancers , lack Cx43 protein expression ( 66 , 67 ) . Similarly , gapjunction - mediatedintercellular communication is often impaired in cultured human cell lines compared to that in corresponding noncancerous cells ( 49 – 51 , 65 – 67 , 95 ) . Interestingly , HeLa cells ( which fail to express Cx43 ) are susceptible to VacA - induced cell vacuolation . This observa - tionsuggeststhatalthoughCx43contributestoVacA - inducedcell death , it is not required for VacA - induced cell vacuolation . In summary , this study provides strong evidence that Cx43 has animportantroleinVacA - induceddeathofgastricepithelialcells . These results are consistent with a growing body of evidence indi - cating that Cx43 can contribute to cell death in many different cell types and tissues ( 48 , 76 , 79 , 80 , 84 ) . VacA - mediated death of gastric epithelial cells through a Cx43 - dependent pathway may be particularly important in the pathogenesis of H . pylori - associated pepticulceration . Wespeculatethatthereestablishmentofepithe - lial integrity in the setting of gastric ulceration and persistent H . pylori infection might favor proliferation of cells that exhibit de - creased expression of Cx43 , and such cells may have increased potential for malignant transformation .
