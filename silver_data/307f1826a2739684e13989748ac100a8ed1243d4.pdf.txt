The CTD is comprised of a repeating heptapeptide ( Y 1 S 2 P 3 T 4 S 5 P 6 S 7 ) . Recently , phos - phorylation of serine 7 was shown to be important for cotranscriptional processing of two snRNAs in mammalian cells . Here we report that Kin28 / Cdk7 , a subunit of the evolutionarily conserved TFIIH complex , is a Ser7 kinase . The ability of Kin28 / Cdk7 to phosphorylate Ser7 is particularly surprising because this kinase functions at promoters of protein - coding genes , rather than being restricted to promoter - distal regions of snRNA genes . Kin28 / Cdk7 is also known to phosphorylate Ser5 residues of the CTD at gene promoters . Taken together , our results implicate the TFIIH kinase in placing bivalent Ser5 and Ser7 marks early in gene transcription . These bivalent CTD marks , in concert with cues within nascent transcripts , specify the cotranscrip - tional engagement of the relevant RNA processing machinery . INTRODUCTION The CTD is reversibly modiﬁed by several enzymes , including kinases , phosphatases , prolyl isomerases , and glycosylases ( Phatnani and Greenleaf , 2006 ; Sims et al . , 2004 ) . Differentially modiﬁed CTD heptapeptides are selectively bound by different protein complexes that participate in RNA biogenesis ( Buratow - ski , 2003 ; Corden , 2007 ; Egloff and Murphy , 2008 ; Hirose and Manley , 2000 ; Phatnani and Greenleaf , 2006 ) . A hypophos - phorylated CTD associates with the Mediator complex at gene promoters ( Lee and Young , 2000 ; Myers and Kornberg , 2000 ; Ptashne and Gann , 2002 ) . Phosphorylation of Ser5 , primarily by the TFIIH - associated kinase Kin28 / Cdk7 , enhances the association of the CTD with the m7G RNA - capping machinery ( Komarnitsky et al . , 2000 ; Schroeder et al . , 2000 ) . The subse - quent phosphorylation of Ser2 by Ctk1 / Cdk9 leads to the recruit - ment of 3 0 end processing complexes ( Ahn et al . , 2004 ; Licatalosi et al . , 2002 ; Proudfoot et al . , 2002 ) . The sequential patterns of CTD modiﬁcations are postulated to deﬁne a spatiotemporal code that instructs ordered engagement with different functional complexes at various stages of the transcription cycle ( Buratow - ski , 2003 ; Corden , 2007 ; Egloff and Murphy , 2008 ; Phatnani and Greenleaf , 2006 ) . Ser7 phosphorylation was recently detected in mammalian cells ( Chapman et al . , 2007 ; Egloff et al . , 2007 ) . This mark was most evident in polymerases engaged in transcription elonga - tion , well within the coding regions of genes ( Chapman et al . , 2007 ) . While this CTD modiﬁcation is detected at protein - coding genes , it is functionally important for processing of two spliceo - somal snRNAs that are transcribed by Pol II ( Egloff et al . , 2007 ) . Substituting Ser7 with an alanine residue in tissue culture cells dramatically reduced transcription and processing of snRNA genes but did not alter the transcription or processing of protein - coding genes . In agreement with this gene - speciﬁc role , Ser7 phosphorylation of the CTD was necessary for the stable association of the Integrator complex with the transcribing polymerase ( Egloff et al . , 2007 ) . The multisubunit Integrator complex is critical for 3 0 processing of snRNA and does not participate in processing transcripts of protein - coding genes ( Baillat et al . , 2005 ) . Thus , the Ser7 phosphorylation mark ( Ser7 - P ) and the Integrator complex are functionally restricted to the transcription of a speciﬁc gene class . This gene - speciﬁc role for Ser7 - P raises the key question of whether the kinase that performs this task is uniquely recruited to snRNA genes . Furthermore , the enrichment of Ser7 - P marks deep within the transcribed region suggests that the Ser7 kinase may associate with the elongating Pol II , consistent with its role in preparing Pol II for association with the 3 0 snRNA processing machinery . Iden - tifying the Ser7 kinase is therefore critical for understanding the mechanisms that underlie the ability of the CTD to orchestrate different processes during transcription . The tandem heptapeptide ( Y 1 S 2 P 3 T 4 S 5 P 6 S 7 ) repeats of the CTDareconservedfromprotozoatohumans . Thenumberofhep - tapeptiderepeats increases in proportion to the complexity of the organism , withprotozoacontaining15repeats , buddingyeast26 , and humans 52 ( Chapman et al . , 2008 ; Corden , 1990 ) However , nearly 35 repeats were required for efﬁcient phosphorylation of Molecular Cell 34 , 387 – 393 , May 15 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . 387 Ser7 in mammalian cells ( Chapman et al . , 2007 ) . Thus , organisms containingfewer than 35 heptapeptide repeats might lack Ser7 - P marks . TherestrictionofSer7 - Pfunctiontohighereukaryoteswas further suggested by the fact that most subunits of the Integrator complex have clearly conserved homologs in other metazoan organisms but are largely missing in budding yeast . Furthermore , DNA - induced protein kinase , DNA - PK , the only kinase known to phosphorylate Ser7 , has no orthologs in budding yeast ( Trigon et al . , 1998 ) . Thus , it was not clear if the Ser7 residue of the hep - tapeptide is phosphorylated in single - celled eukaryotes or if this modiﬁcation is restricted to higher eukaryotes . RESULTS Ser7 Is Phosphorylated in Budding Yeast To examine if the Ser7 - P mark occurred in simpler eukaryotes , we used a monoclonal a Ser7 - P antibody ( Chapman et al . , 2007 ) to detect this modiﬁcation on Pol II in whole - cell extracts of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . The data unam - biguously show that this modiﬁcation occurs in budding yeast ( Figure 1A ) . Given the conservation from yeast to humans of the Ser7 - P mark and the CTD kinases that act on Ser5 and Ser2 , it seemed reasonable that the Ser7 kinase could be identi - ﬁed by proteomic and chemical - genomic analyses in yeast ( Bishop et al . , 2001 ; Zhu et al . , 2001 ) . We therefore focused on 26 yeast kinases that are present in the nuclear compartment under log - phase growth in rich medium ( Kumar et al . , 2002 ) . Twenty - three of these kinases were previously genetically tagged with the tandem afﬁnity puriﬁcation ( TAP ) module ( Open Biosystems ) . The TAP module is chromosomally inte - grated at the 3 0 end of the kinase - coding region , and the fusion protein is expressed at physiological levels ( Ghaemmaghami et al . , 2003 ; Puig et al . , 2001 ) . In the case of Srb10 / Cdk8 kinase , we used the TAP fusion to its cyclin ( Srb11 ) to purify the func - tional cyclin - kinase complex . Because cyclins often direct substrates to their associated kinases ( Nigg , 1996 ; Schulman et al . , 1998 ) , we also puriﬁed the cyclin Ctk2 that associates with Ctk1 / Cdk9 and Pho80 that associates with Pho85 to examine if the coprecipitated kinases phosphorylate Ser7 . The enzymes were puriﬁed from yeast , and their ability to phosphor - ylate a recombinant CTD was examined ( Ansari et al . , 2005 ) . In this assay , only Kin28 efﬁciently phosphorylates Ser7 ( Figure 1B ) . In control experiments , we readily detect the appear - ance of Ser5 - P and Ser2 - P marks with the four CTD kinases known to perform those reactions ( see Figures S1A and S1B available online ) . Parallel immunoblots also show that all 23 fusions are expressed ( Figure S1C ) and that the fused kinases phosphorylate an orthologous universal substrate , Ptk2 ( Figure S1D ) . Finally , to quantify the extent of Ser5 and Ser7 phosphorylation by Kin28 , we performed enzyme - linked immu - noassays ( ELISA ) . The results suggest that Kin28 phosphory - lates Ser7 as efﬁciently as Ser5 ( Figure 1C ) . In these assays , Srb10 , the other Ser5 kinase that associates with Pol II , does not phosphorylate Ser7 . TFIIH Kinase Phosphorylates Ser7 Cyclin - dependent kinases ( Cdks ) are promiscuous enzymes , and their substrate choices are governed by cyclins that recruit speciﬁc target proteins ( Nigg , 1996 ; Schulman et al . , 1998 ) . The substrate preference of Cdk7 , the human homolog of Kin28 , is speciﬁed by other subunits of the TFIIH complex ( Feaver et al . , 1994 ; Svejstrup et al . , 1994 ; Watanabe et al . , 2000 ) . Thus , Kin28 within the TFIIH complex could display altered substrate selectivity and might not phosphorylate Ser7 . We therefore examined whether the TFIIH - associated Kin28 would phosphor - ylate Ser7 residue of the CTD . Kin28 associates with the cyclin Ccl1 and a third partner ( Tfb3 ) to form an active TFIIK complex that phosphorylates Ser5 of the CTD ( Feaver et al . , 1994 , 1997 ) . C B A Figure 1 .

TFIIK further associates with the ‘‘core’’ seven - subunit complex to form the TFIIH complex ( Figure 2A ) ( Feaver et al . , 1994 ; Svejstrup et al . , 1994 ; Ranish et al . , 2004 ) . As part of the TFIIH complex , the kinase shows a high degree of substrate speciﬁcity and selectively phosphorylates the CTD , two subunits of tran - scriptional machinery ( Med4 and Rgr1 ) , and the transcription activator Gal4 ( Feaver et al . , 1994 ; Watanabe et al . , 2000 ; Guidi et al . , 2004 ; Hirst et al . , 1999 ; Liu et al . , 2004 ; Muratani et al . , 2005 ; Sadowski et al . , 1991 ) . We puriﬁed TFIIH using TAP fusions to different subunits of the complex . In each case , the associated Kin28 kinase robustly phosphorylates Ser7 as well as Ser5 ( Figure 2A ) . These results indicate that TFIIH - associated Kin28 , despite its increased substrate speciﬁcity , phosphorylates Ser7 . The TFIIH complex itself associates with numerous protein partners and even with the U1 - snRNA ( Esnault et al . , 2008 ; Roeder , 2005 ; Kwek et al . , 2002 ; Zurita and Merino , 2003 ) . Hence , rather than Kin28 , it is possible that an unrelated kinase that substoichiometrically associates with TFIIH is responsible for the Ser7 modiﬁcation . To address this concern , we engi - neered the TAP - tagged Kin28 to accept a bulky analog of a kinase inhibitor ( Figure S2 ) . This bulky analog is incapable of docking into ATP - binding pockets of unmodiﬁed kinases ( Bishop et al . , 2000 , 2001 ) . In contrast , the engineered Kin28as ( analog sensitized ) is inhibited at micromolar concentrations of the designed inhibitor , 1 - NAPP1 ( Kanin et al . , 2007 ; Liu et al . , 2004 ) . The TAP - tagged Kin28as ( Kin28 - L83G ) enzyme is unable to phosphorylate Ser5 or Ser7 in the presence of the inhibitor but is as active as the wild - type kinase in the presence of ATP ( Figure 2B ) . As expected , due to the inability of the inhibitor to dock in an unmodiﬁed ATP - binding pocket , the activity of wild - type Kin28 is not detectably perturbed by the inhibitor . These results suggest that Kin28 directly phosphorylates Ser7 . However , Ser7 phosphorylation might be dependent on prior phosphorylation of Ser5 by Kin28 ( Chapman et al . , 2007 ) . We therefore examined the ability of Kin28 to phosphorylate recombinant CTD substrates wherein Ser2 , - 5 , or - 7 have been substituted by an alanine residue ( Figure 2C ) . The data show that an alanine at position 2 or 7 does not detectably affect the ability of Kin28 to phosphorylate Ser5 . In contrast , replacing Ser5 with an alanine dramatically reduces the ability of Kin28 to phosphorylate Ser7 . In other words , inhibiting Ser5 phosphor - ylation by chemical inhibition could block subsequent phosphor - ylation of Ser7 by a different kinase . To directly test if Kin28 can phosphorylate both Ser5 and Ser7 , we used N 6 - benzyl - ATP as a phosphodonor in kinase reactions with Kin28 or Kin28as A B D C Figure 2 .

This modiﬁed ATP docks into the expanded ATP - binding pocket of Kin28as but is not used efﬁ - ciently by unmodiﬁed kinases . The enlargement of the ATP - binding site does not alter substrate speciﬁcity of the kinase ( Liu et al . , 1998 , 2004 ; Bishop et al . , 2000 , 2001 ) . In this context , the appearance of Ser7 - P mark with N 6 - benzyl - ATP therefore conﬁrms that Kin28as phosphorylates both Ser7 and Ser5 resi - dues of the CTD heptad ( Figure 2D ) . Chemical Genomics Evidence for Ser7 Phosphorylation by Kin28 In Vivo WeexaminedtheconsequencesofchemicallyinhibitingKin28on Ser7phosphorylationpatternsacrossthegenome . Thegrowthof cells bearing the Kin28as allele is greatly attenuated by micro - molar concentrations of the cell - permeable inhibitor ( Figure S3 ) ( Kanin et al . , 2007 ; Liu et al . , 2004 ) . Chromatin immunoprecipita - tion ( ChIP ) assaysshowthatwithin20minofinhibition , theSer5 - P marks of CTD are dramatically reduced in Kin28as strains ( Kanin et al . , 2007 ; Liu et al . , 2004 ) . Using high - resolution genome tiling microarrays , we examined the genome - wide proﬁles of Ser5 - P and Ser7 - P CTD modiﬁcations ( Figure 3 ) . We focused on the snRNA genes that code for spliceosomal transcripts because of the key role of Ser7 phosphorylation in the expression of these genes ( Figure 3A ) . At all ﬁve snRNA genes , the proﬁles of Ser7 - P closely mirror those of Ser5 - P ( Figure 3 and Figure S4 ) . SNR6 ( U6 ) , which is transcribed by Pol III , serves as negative control with background levels of Pol II and Ser5 / 7 phosphorylation proﬁles . Strikingly , inhibition of Kin28 eliminates both Ser7 - P and Ser5 - P peaks . A similar remodeling of the proﬁles is also seen at protein - coding genes ( Figure 3B ) . We focused on protein - coding genes with uniformly robust Pol II occupancy across the entire open reading frame ( Steinmetz et al . , 2006 ) . Ofthese415genes , 308withwell - deﬁnedtranscriptionstartsites were clustered based on the CTD modiﬁcation proﬁles . Upon Kin28 inhibition , the attenuation of Ser7 - P and Ser5 - P proﬁles is clearly evident ( Figure 3B ) . The results across the genome reﬂect this loss of Ser7 - P phosphorylation at the promoter regions and are consistent with the ability of Kin28 to phosphor - ylate Ser7 . The results strongly implicate Kin28 in the phosphor - ylation of Ser7 and Ser5 residues of the CTD in vivo . Human Homolog Cdk7 Phosphorylates Ser7 Residue TFIIH and its associated kinase are highly conserved from yeast to humans ( Chapman et al . , 2008 ; Coin and Egly , 1998 ; Egloff and Murphy , 2008 ; Zurita and Merino , 2003 ) . To determine if the substrate speciﬁcity for Ser7 was conserved in the human ortholog , we examined the ability of the Cdk7 / cyclinH complex , as well as other puriﬁed Cdks , to phosphorylate Ser7 . The results demonstrate that the human ortholog of Kin28 phosphorylates both Ser7 and the expected Ser5 residue of the CTD heptapep - tide ( Figure 4 ) . Moreover , Cdk8 / CycC , like its yeast ortholog Srb10 / Srb11 , phosphorylates Ser5 , but not Ser7 . Thus , Kin28 and Cdk7 show identical substrate speciﬁcity for Ser5 and Ser7 of the CTD .

DISCUSSION The identiﬁcation of TFIIH - associated kinase as the Ser7 kinase is unexpected for multiple reasons . First , it belongs to the Cdk family . Members of this family prefer Ser - Pro dipeptide cores in its substrates , whereas Ser7 of the CTD is ﬂanked by a tyrosine residue ( Songyang et al . , 1996 ) . Second , Kin28 / Cdk7 as a subunit of TFIIH associates with Pol II at gene promoters and not deep within transcribed regions , where the Ser7 - P mark was ﬁrst found to be enriched ( Chapman et al . , 2007 ) . Third , this kinase associates with most , if not all , Pol II - transcribed genes and is not known to play a speciﬁc role in snRNA gene expression . Fourth , biochemical analyses suggest that TFIIH is not associated with Pol II and the transcriptional machinery at snRNA promoters ( Hernandez , 2001 ) . Finally , Kin28 / Cdk7 is known to speciﬁcally phosphorylate Ser5 residues of the CTD and does not display an ability to phosphorylate the adjacent Ser2 residues appreciably . In contrast to expectations , ourdata strongly implicate TFIIH in the placement of Ser7 marks at promoters of Pol II - transcribed genes and reveal the involvement of TFIIH in the transcription of snRNA in vivo . We anticipate that the Integrator complex ( or its functional analog in budding yeast ) is recruited , in part , by Ser7 phosphorylation at snRNA gene promoters . This recruit - ment is a consequence not only of Ser7 - P marks but also of the promoter elements and the specialized preinitiation complex that binds those elements . After promoter escape , the RNA pro - cessing complex travels with the elongating polymerase , and in response to the 3 0 end box at the end of the snRNA transcription unit , the processing complex associates with the nascent transcript and engages in cotranscriptional processing . At protein - coding genes , the promoter - bound factors facilitate the association of the CPSF complex ( Dantonel et al . , 1997 ; Glover - Cutter et al . , 2007 ) or the Nrd1 complex ( Vasiljeva et al . , 2008 ; Gudipati et al . , 2008 ) with Pol II . Each of these complexes , Integrator , Nrd1 , or CPSF , responds to different processing sequences within nascent transcripts . Our data suggest that bivalent Ser5 - P + Ser7 - P marks are placed by the TFIIH - associated kinase during early stages of gene transcription . It is likely that this bivalent mark , rather than Ser5 - P alone , is recognized by Bur1 or pTEFb / Cdk9 , enzymes that act next on the CTD ( Viladevall et al . , 2009 ; Qiu et al . , 2009 ) . Furthermore , given the universality of the Ser7 - P mark , we propose that information relayed by promoter - speciﬁc complexes , differential CTD modiﬁcations , and RNA - borne signals is integrated to engage the relevant protein complex to processdifferentclassesoftranscripts . Theseobservationsforce a re - evaluation of the basic recognition determinants and mech - anisms used by partnering proteins to decipher the CTD code . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Strains and Kinases TAP - tagged Kin28as ( Kin28 - L83G ) was a gift from Professor Steven Hahn ( Seattle ) . Mammalian kinases were purchased from Proqinase / Biomol . TAP - tagged yeast kinases were purchased from Open Biosystems and puriﬁed as described previously ( Liu et al . , 2004 ; Puig et al . , 2001 ) .
