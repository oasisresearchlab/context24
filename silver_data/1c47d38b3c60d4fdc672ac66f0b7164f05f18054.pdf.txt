The effects of increased Ca 2 + on BDNF up - regula - tion and neurite outgrowth remain unclear . We showed here that ES increased phosphory - lation of the cAMP - response element binding protein ( CREB ) . Blockade of Ca 2 + suppressed CREB phosphorylation and neurite outgrowth . Down - regulation of phosphory - lated ( p ) - CREB reduced BDNF transcription and neurite outgrowth triggeredby ES . Further - more , blockade of calmodulin - dependent protein kinase II ( CaMKII ) using the inhibitors KN93 or KN62 reduced p - CREB , and specific knockdown of the CaMKII α or CaMKII β sub - unit was sufficient to suppress p - CREB . Recombinant BDNF or hyperforin reversed the effects of Ca 2 + blockade and CaMKII knockdown . Taken together , these data establish a potential signaling pathway of Ca 2 + - CaMKII - CREB in neuronal activation . To our knowl - edge , this is the first reportof the mechanisms of Ca 2 + - dependent BDNF transcription and neurite outgrowth triggered by ES . These findings might help furtherinvestigation of com - plex molecular signaling networks in ES - triggerednerve regeneration in vivo . Introduction Electricalstimulation ( ES ) induces regeneration - related gene expression and neurite outgrowth of dorsal root ganglion neurons ( DRGNs ) [ 1 , 2 ] , and accelerates axon regeneration of central and peripheral nerves [ 3 , 4 ] . Our previous study showed that ES accelerates neurite outgrowth and expression of brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) , accompanied by an elevation in PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0162784 September9 , 2016 1 / 22 a11111 OPEN ACCESS Citation : Yan X , LiuJ , Ye Z , HuangJ , He F , Xiao W , et al .

However , the correlation between Ca 2 + increase and ES - induced neurite outgrowth and BDNF expression remains unclear . One important neurotrophic factor , BDNF , mediates neuronal development and synaptic function [ 6 ] , which is critical for differentiation and survival of neurons during development [ 7 ] . BDNF transcription is Ca 2 + - dependent [ 6 , 8 ] . The cAMP - response element binding pro - tein ( CREB ) mediates BDNF transcription [ 6 ] . A number of pathways that may contribute to CREB activation by phosphorylation at Ser - 133 have been identified [ 6 , 9 – 12 ] . Studies have shown that Ca 2 + , as an important messenger acting via Ca 2 + / calmodulin - dependentprotein kinases ( CaMKs ) , triggers phosphorylation of CREB [ 13 ] , and that phosphorylated CREB ( p - CREB ) activates BDNF transcription by binding to a calcium response element within the gene [ 6 ] . The Ca 2 + signaling that activates CREB can be traced back to CaMKs , which are activated by the Ca 2 + / calmodulin complex . Numerous Ca 2 + - evoked responses are regulated by calmodu - lin , a Ca 2 + - binding protein , and its downstream molecules CaMKs , such as CaMK - kinase ( CaMKK ) , CaMKI , CaMKII , and CaMKIV [ 14 ] . Although CREB can be phosphorylated at the Ser - 133 residue by all CaMKs , CaMKI and CaMKIV must be phosphorylated by a CaMK kinase before being activated by calcium and calmodulin [ 15 ] . CaMKI mediates Ca 2 + - induced neurite outgrowth through activation of extracellular signal - regulated kinase or microtubule affinity - regulating kinase 2 ( MARK2 ) , and CaMKIV mediates neuritogenesis by phosphoryla - tion of CREB and subsequent CREB - dependent transcription [ 16 ] . It has been proposed that the CaMKK - CaMKIVcascade is involved in Ca + - induced neurite growth through CREB phos - phorylation and transcriptional activation [ 11 , 17 ] . CaMKII , which is encoded by four different genes , includes about 12 subunits [ 18 , 19 ] . The CaMKII α and β subunits are abundant in ner - vous systems , whereas CaMKII γ and δ are widely present in non - neuronal tissues [ 20 ] . CaM - KII can be activated by Ca 2 + and calmodulin , resulting in autophosphorylation . CaMKII phosphorylation activates signaling molecules and several other transcription factors including CREB [ 13 ] . In addition , the CaMKIV - CREB pathway mediates dendrite growth in hippocam - pal neurons [ 11 ] . However , the contributions of Ca 2 + increase and CaMKs to ES - induced BDNF transcription and neurite outgrowth have not previously been shown . Furthermore , although differential transcription of the BDNF gene is involved in a specific region of central and peripheral nervous systems [ 21 , 22 ] , the mechanisms by which BDNF transcription is up - regulated in cultured DRGNs by exogenic factors , such as ES , remain unclear . In the present study , we investigated the role of CREB in ES - induced BDNF transcription and neurite outgrowth . We show that ES induced p - CREB , which was effectively suppressed by the application of Ca 2 + inhibitors . Down - regulation of CaMKII through a pharmacological approach or RNA interference markedly reduced p - CREB . Application of Ca 2 + inhibitors or knockdown of CREB or CaMKII reduced BDNF transcription and neurite outgrowth . Our data established a molecular pathway of Ca 2 + - CaMKII - CREB that can mediate ES - induced BDNF transcription and neurite outgrowth in cultured DRGNs . Materials and Methods Preparation of rat DRGN cultures Culture of primary DRGNs was performed by following the procedures describedpreviously [ 5 ] . DRGs ( C5 - L6 ) from neonatal 24 hr - old Sprague Dawley rats ( Laboratory Animal Center of Fourth Military Medical University ) were harvested and digested in a mixture of 0 . 05 % col - lagenase IV ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) and 0 . 125 % trypsin ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) . Cells were cul - tured in Neurobasal medium A ( Gibco BRL , Grand Island , NY ) containing 1 % penicillin and streptomycin , 2 mM Glutamax I ( Gibco BRL ) , and 2 % B27 supplement ( Gibco BRL ) . Mouse CaMKII / CREB MediatesES - Induced NeuriteOutgrowth PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0162784 September9 , 2016 2 / 22 anti - rat β - tubulin III monoclonal antibody ( 1 : 500 ; Chemicon , USA ) was used to assess the purity of DRGN cultures by immunocytochemistry . The purity of β - tubulin III positive cells was higher than 92 % , as determined by the describedevaluation method [ 5 ] . Animal surgery and experimental procedures were approved by the Laboratory Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee of Fourth Military Medical University and were carried out according to the princi - ples of laboratory animal care . Electrical stimulation of DRGNs DRGNs were treated with ES using conductive indium tin oxide ( ITO ) conductive silica glass ( 30 O / cm 2 ; Kinoene Kogaku , Japan ) by following the protocol describedpreviously [ 5 ] . Briefly , after 1 - day growth at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 , DRGNs cultured on the ITO glass were stimulated for 0 – 60 min with biphasic rectangular pulses delivered at 5 V and 10 Hz . Neurons in sham groups were cultured on the ITO glass without ES . Before ES application , neurons in treatment groups were incubated in culture medium supplemented with drugs at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 for 30 min . Immunocytochemistry assay for p - CREB in DRGNs Neurons were first fixed with phosphate - buffered 4 % paraformaldehyde ( pH 7 . 35 ) at room temperature for 20 min . After wash with 0 . 01 M phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) ( pH 7 . 5 ) , neurons were permeabilizedin 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 2 min , then incubated with the following antibodies : mouse anti - rat β - III tubulin monoclonal antibody ( 1 : 500 ; Cat . No . 05 – 559 , Milli - pore , Billerica , MA , USA ) , rabbit anti - rat p - CREB ( Ser133 ) monoclonal antibody ( 1 : 800 ; Cat . No . 9198 , Cell Signaling Technology , USA ) , rabbit anti - rat CaMKK monoclonal antibody ( 1 : 250 ; Cat . No . ab174289 , Abcam , USA ) , rabbit anti - rat CaMKI monoclonal antibody ( 1 : 250 ; Cat . No . ab68234 , Abcam , USA ) , and rabbit anti - rat CaMKIV monoclonal antibody ( 1 : 250 ; Cat . No . ab75874 , Abcam , USA ) at 4°C overnight . The negative control omitted the primary p - CREB antibody . On the next day , the neurons were incubated with the secondarygoat anti - mouse IgG labeled with cy3 ( 1 : 500 , Cat . No . ab97035 , Abcam , USA ) [ 23 ] and goat anti - rabbit IgG labeled with cy2 ( 1 : 500 , Cat . No . ab6940 , Abcam , USA ) at room temperature for 1 hr . Neu - ronal nuclei were stained with 20 μg / mL 4’ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole dihydrochloride ( DAPI ) . Finally , neurons were observedwith a fluorescence microscope ( BX51 , Olympus , Japan ) . Measurement of intracellular Ca 2 + in DRGNs Intracellular Ca 2 + in DRGNs was measured as previously described [ 5 ] . During the initial 5 min of the experiment after subtracting background fluorescence , baseline fluorescence ( F 0 ) was measured as an average normalized fluorescence emitted . Ca 2 + intensity was captured as fluorescence ( F ) from selected areas within a cell following the subtraction of background fluo - rescence . Fluorescence traces represented the fold fluorescence over baseline after background subtraction ( F / F 0 ) . Cells were first incubated with drugs at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 for 30 min , washed in Hanks’ balanced salt solution ( HBSS ) twice , and then loaded with fluo - 4 as previously described [ 5 , 24 ] . Lentiviral vector transduction in DRGNs The lentivarial CREB - shRNA or CaMKII - shRNA with puromycin resistance ( Genechem , Shanghai , China ) was applied to specificallyknockdown the transcription of CREB or CaMKII . Randomly chosen nonsense sequences were used as controls . The validated shRNA sequences were CREB : 5’ - AAGCACTTAAGGACCTTTACT - 3’ ( GenBank NM 031017 ) , CaMKII α 5’ - CaMKII / CREB MediatesES - Induced NeuriteOutgrowth PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0162784 September9 , 2016 3 / 22 CCACTACCTTATCTTCGAT - 3’ ( GenBank NM 012920 ) , and CaMKII β : 5’ - GAGTATGCA GCTAAGATCA - 3’ ( GenBank NM 021739 ) . Lentiviral vector transduction was carried out according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer . Neurons were transduced at 20× infectious units in the presence of polybrene ( 8 μg / ml ) at 37°C . After 24 hr , the superna - tant was replaced with complete medium supplemented with puromycin . Following puromy - cin screening for 48 hr , transduced cells were treated with ES and collected for immunoblot , quantitative ( q ) PCR , or neurite length analyses . The down - regulation of protein expression of CREB , CaMKII α and CaMKII β was determined by Western blot . Western blot Neurons were collectedand lysed in a mixture of 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 400 μM phenyl - methylsulfonyl fluoride , 1 . 5 μM aprotinin , 0 . 5 M NaCl , 2 μM pepstatin , 4 μM leupeptin , and 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 . Neurons were lysed by homogenization and sonication . Forty micrograms of each protein sample were used for the assay . Denatured proteins were separated by Tris - glycine SDS - PAGE ( Bio - Rad , USA ) . Separated proteins in gels were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and were incubated with primary antibodies to CREB ( rabbit monoclonal , 1 : 1000 ; Cat . No . 9197 , Cell Signaling Technology , USA ) , p - CREB ( pSer - 133 ) ( rabbit monoclonal , 1 : 1000 ; Cat . No . 9198 , Cell Signaling Technology , USA ) , histone H1 ( mouse monoclonal , 1 : 1000 ; Cat . No . ab11080 , Abcam , USA ) , CaMKII α ( mouse monoclonal , 1 : 200 ; Cat . No . sc - 13141 , Santa Cruz Bio - technology , Inc . , USA ) , CaMKII β ( goat polyclonal , 1 : 200 ; Cat . No . sc - 1540 , Santa Cruz Biotech - nology , Inc . , USA ) , CaMKK ( rabbit monoclonal , 1 : 1000 ; Cat . No . ab174289 , Abcam , USA ) , CaMKI ( rabbit monoclonal , 1 : 5000 ; Cat . No . ab68234 , Abcam , USA ) , CaMKIV ( rabbit monoclo - nal , 1 : 2000 ; Cat . No . ab75874 , Abcam , USA ) , β - actin ( rabbit polyclonal , 1 : 500 ; Cat . No . sc - 130656 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . , USA ) , and β - tubulin ( mouse monoclonal , 1 : 500 ; Cat . No . sc - 23949 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . , USA ) in 0 . 01 M PBS ( pH 7 . 5 ) mixed with 0 . 1 % Tween 20 and 5 % skin - milkat 4°C overnight . Protein bands were visualizedby an enhanced chemilumines - cence kit ( Thermo Scientific , USA ) and film development . Protein bands were analyzed using ImageJ software ( NIH , Bethesda , MD ) . Real - time qPCR analysis Total RNA from treated neurons was extracted using RNAiso reagent ( TaKaRa , Dalian , China ) . Total RNA ( 1 μg ) of each group of cells was reverse - transcribedto cDNA using the reagent of PrimeScript 1 RT Master Mix Perfect Real Time ( TaKaRa , Dalian , China ) . The primers were as follows : β - actin ( 150 bp ) : 5’ - GGAGATTACTGCCCTGGCTCCTA - 3’ ( for - ward ) , 5’ - GACTCATCGTACTCCTGCTTGCTG - 3’ ( reverse ) ; BDNF ( 89 bp ) : 5’ - CAAAAGG CACTGGAACTCGC - 3’ ( forward ) , 5’ - ACCGCCAGCCAATTCTCTTT - 3’ ( reverse ) . β - actin was used as loading control . qPCR was carried out using Mini Opticon TM System ( Bio - Rad , USA ) with triplicates in 96 - well plates . Each reaction ( 25 μL ) consisted of 12 . 5 μL SYBR 1 Pre - mix Ex Taq TM II ( TaKaRa , Dalian , China ) , 2 μL template , 1 μL 10 μmol / L sense , and 1 μL 10 μmol / L anti - sense primers . The SYBR Green I Dye fluorescence in each cycle was monitored using Opticon Monitor TM software ( version 3 . 1 , Bio - Rad ) . The data was analyzed according to the method describedpreviously [ 25 ] . Levels of BDNF mRNA were normalized to that of β - actin mRNA . Determinationof intracellular BDNF level To confirm the changes of BDNF mRNA levels , intracellular amounts of BDNF protein were determined . Neurons were lysed using NP40 Cell Lysis Buffer ( Thermo Scientific , USA ) . The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay .

Briefly , protein samples were added to wells pre - coated with biotinylated BDNF antibody . Streptavidin - HRP solution was added to each well and incubated for 45 min at room temperature with gentle shaking . Then , wells were washed and incubated with tetramethylbenzidine for 30 min at room temperature . The plate was evaluated within 30 min of stopping the reaction . Absorbance was measured on an ELISA plate reader set at 450 nm in a micro - plate reader ( SUNOSTIK , China ) . Analysis of neurite length A total of 8 – 10 random 10× or 20× fields were imaged using BX - 51 fluorescence microscopes ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) . Neurite length analysis was carried out according to the method describedin previous studies [ 5 , 26 , 27 ] . We used the basic criteria for assessing neurite length : only the maximal distance along a neurite was defined as the neurite length ; if there was more than one neurite , the distance from the soma to the end of the longest neurite was adopted ; if there were branched neurites , the distance from the soma to the end of the longest branch at each branch - point was adopted . The average neurite length per neuron in each group was cal - culated and compared . Drugs Omega - conotoxin GVIA ( CON ) was used at a final concentration of 1 μM ( dissolved in sterile distilled water ) . Dantrolene ( DAN ) , thapsigargin ( THA ) , KN93 , KN62 , and STO609 were used at final concentrations of 3 , 5 , 10 , and 50 μM ( dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) ) . Nimo - dipine ( NIM ) was used at a final concentration of 2 μM ( dissolved in ethanol ) . The solvents and optimized final concentrations were adopted from previous studies [ 5 , 24 ] . Recombinant BDNF and hyperforin ( HF ) ( Sigma , St Louis , MO , USA ) were used at final concentrations of 10 ng / ml and 0 . 3 μM , respectively . According to previous studies [ 28 , 29 ] , the maximal concen - tration of ethanol or DMSO used was controlled at 0 . 02 % and 0 . 1 % , respectively . Cell viability assay Neurons were first treated with drugs at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 for 30 min and washed twice with HBSS . Cell viability was evaluated with the staining of Hoechst 33342 / propidium iodide ( PI ) according to a previously describedprotocol [ 24 ] . The calculation of cell viability was : Cell via - bility = 1 - ( PI - positive cells / Hoechst 33342 - positive cells × 100 % ) . Data analysis The results from several cultures ( n (cid:21) 3 ) were pooled for statistical analysis . Data are shown as mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) . Analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) with Tukey’s post - hoc multi - ple comparisons was used for the comparison of the ratios among groups ( SPSS 13 . 0 software , Chicago , IL , USA ) . P < 0 . 05 was considered significantly different . Results ES induces p - CREB in DRGNs To address whether ES induces p - CREB , we used an antibody specific to p - CREB ( pSer - 133 ) for detection . p - CREB was localized in the nuclei of cultured DRGNs . In contrast , β - tubulin III was predominantly expressed in the cytosol and neurite ( Fig 1A ) . Results in Fig 1B show that the p - CREB level was elevated in the ES group ( 5 V , 10 Hz , 30 min ) compared to the control . 10 min ES was sufficient to induce elevation of p - CREB ( P < 0 . 05 ) ; 30 min ES induced an CaMKII / CREB MediatesES - Induced NeuriteOutgrowth PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0162784 September9 , 2016 5 / 22 approximate 5 - fold increase in p - CREB compared to control ( P < 0 . 05 ) ; and 60 min ES induced an increase in p - CREB level similar to 30 min ES ( P > 0 . 05 ) ( Fig 1B ) . Therefore , 10 – 60 min ES induced p - CREB in cultured DRGNs . Blocking intracellular Ca 2 + suppresses ES - induced elevation of p - CREB We previously showed that ES increases intracellular Ca 2 + in cultured DRGNs [ 5 ] . To examine whether Ca 2 + is involved in ES - induced p - CREB , we applied Ca 2 + inhibitors to the cell cultures and analyzed the levels of p - CREB after ES . 30 min ES significantly increased intracellular Ca 2 + ( P < 0 . 05 , compared to the sham group ) . Application of voltage - gated Ca 2 + channel blockers NIM ( 2 μM ) and CON ( 1 μM ) , and Ca 2 + store inhibitors DAN ( 50 μM ) and THA ( 10 μM ) for 30 min , followed by ES 30 min , completely blocked the Ca 2 + increase ( P < 0 . 05 , compared to the ES group ) . Application of NIM ( 2 μM ) and CON ( 1 μM ) for 30 min , or DAN ( 50 μM ) and THA ( 10 μM ) for 30 min , followed by ES for 30 min , also significantly blocked the Ca 2 + increase compared to the ES group ( P < 0 . 05 for both comparisons ) ( Fig 2A ) . Treatment of four or two Ca 2 + inhibitors for 30 min had no effect on cell viability ( data not shown ) . Hence , Fig 1 . ES inducesp - CREBin DRGNs .

The p - CREB levels were examined in cells treated with Ca 2 + inhibitors and ES . Treatment with four inhibitors for 30 min followed by ES for 10 min did not induce a significant increase in p - CREB . Treatment with four inhibitors for 30 min , and ES for 30 or 60 min , increased p - CREB compared to the control group ( with four inhibitors for 30 min and ES for 0 min ) ( P < 0 . 05 for both comparisons ) ( Fig 2B and 2C ) . However , compared to groups without Ca 2 + inhibitors , the 10 , 30 or 60 min ES induced p - CREB increase was greatly suppressed ( Fig 2C ) . Therefore , treatment with four Ca 2 + inhibitors for 30 min effectively suppressed p - CREB . Blocking intracellular Ca 2 + suppresses ES - induced BDNF transcription and neurite outgrowth We next examined the effect of Ca 2 + blockade on ES - induced BDNF transcription and neurite outgrowth . Cultured cells were incubated with four Ca 2 + inhibitors for 30 min and subjected to ES . The BDNF mRNA level in each group was normalized to the β - actin mRNA level ( loading control ) and then normalized to the 0 min control group . Without treatment of Ca 2 + inhibi - tors , 10 min ES increased BDNF transcription approximately 3 . 1 - fold relative to control ( P < 0 . 05 ) ; 30 min ES increased BDNF transcription approximately 5 . 5 - fold ( P < 0 . 05 ) ; and ES for 60 min increased BDNF transcription approximately 5 . 0 - fold ( P < 0 . 05 ) ( Fig 2D ) . Treat - ment with the four Ca 2 + inhibitors for 30 min did not significantly increase BDNF transcrip - tion in response to 10 or 30 min ES , but there was a moderate increase in BDNF transcription ( ~ 2 - fold ) after 60 min ES compared to 0 min ES ( P < 0 . 05 ) ( Fig 2D ) . Thus , application of Ca 2 + inhibitors for 30 min suppressed BDNF transcription in DRGNs . The changes in BDNF mRNA levels were consistent with the changes in protein levels ( Fig 2G ) . The effect of Ca 2 + inhibitors on ES - induced neurite outgrowth was examined . ES for 30 min increased neurite length compared to control ( P < 0 . 05 ) ( Fig 2H ) . Treatment with voltage - gated Ca 2 + channel blockers ( NIM and CON ) for 30 min , followed by 30 min of ES , blocked neurite outgrowth compared to the ES group ( P < 0 . 05 ) ( Fig 2H ) . Similarly , treatment with Ca 2 + store inhibitors ( THA and DAN ) for 30 min , followed by 30 min ES , blocked neurite out - growth compared to the ES group ( P < 0 . 05 ) ( Fig 2H ) . Thus , the application of Ca 2 + inhibitors for 30 min blocked ES - induced neurite outgrowth in cultured DRGNs . In order to determine whether the effects of Ca 2 + inhibitors can be reversed by BDNF appli - cation or constitutively active CREB , recombinant BDNF [ 30 – 32 ] or HF was added into the primary neuron culture medium after ES . HF has been shown to increase phosphorylation of CREB in vivo [ 33 ] and in vitro [ 34 – 36 ] . Data showed that the p - CREB level in the Ca 2 + inhibi - tors / ES / HF group was increased approximately 2 - fold by HF compared to that in the Ca 2 + inhibitors / ES group ( P < 0 . 05 ) ( Fig 2E and 2F ) . HF ( 0 . 3 μM ) also increased neurite outgrowth in the Ca 2 + inhibitors / ES / HF group ( P < 0 . 05 , compared to the Ca 2 + inhibitors / ES group ) ( Fig 2H ) . Furthermore , the inhibitory effect of Ca 2 + inhibitors on neurite outgrowth was reversed by BDNF ( 10 ng / ml ; Sigma , St Louis , MO , USA ) ( P < 0 . 05 , compared to the Ca 2 + inhibitors / ES group ) ( Fig 2H ) . comparedto ES + ; & P < 0 . 05 comparedto ES + / Ca 2 + inhibitors ; F - value = 28 . 325 .

The DRGNs were incubated with media containing control or lentiviral shRNA targeting CREB for 24 hr and subjected to puromycin screening . The successfully transduced cells were resistant to puromycin and were selected for 30 min ES . Data showed that the expression of endogenous CREB was strongly suppressed by CREB shRNA compared to control shRNA ( Fig 3A ) . 30 min ES increased p - CREB in the cells transduced with control shRNA ( P < 0 . 001 , compared to cells without ES ) , whereas the ES - induced p - CREB elevation was blocked in the cells transduced with CREB shRNA ( P < 0 . 001 , compared to cells with control shRNA and 30 min ES ) ( Fig 3B and 3C ) . Therefore , CREB shRNA specificallyblocked ES - induced p - CREB . The effect of p - CREB knockdown on ES - induced BDNF transcription was examined . 30 min ES increased BDNF transcription in cells transduced with control shRNA ( P < 0 . 05 ) . The BDNF transcription was also increased by 30 min ES in cells transduced with CREB shRNA compared to cells without ES ( P < 0 . 05 ) . However , the BDNF mRNA level was significantly lower in cells transduced with CREB shRNA compared to control shRNA ( P < 0 . 05 ) ( Fig 3D ) . The changes in BDNF mRNA were consistent with the changes in protein expression ( Fig 2G ) . The effect of p - CREB knockdown on ES - induced neurite outgrowth was also examined . 30 min ES increased neurite length in cells transduced with control shRNA ( P < 0 . 05 ) . 30 min ES also induced neurite outgrowth in cells transduced with CREB shRNA ( P < 0 . 05 ) . However , ES - induced neurite outgrowth was blocked in cells transduced with CREB shRNA compared to control shRNA ( P < 0 . 05 ) ( Fig 3E and 3F ) . Together , specific knockdown of p - CREB effec - tively blocked ES - induced BDNF transcription and neurite outgrowth in cultured DRGNs . Both CaMKII α and CaMKII β subunits are required for ES - induced p - CREB The CaMK family is critical for gene transcription , cell survival and death [ 18 , 19 , 37 – 39 ] . We treated culture DRGNs with either KN93 ( CaMKII inhibitor ) , KN62 ( CaMKII inhibitor ) , or STO609 ( inhibitor of CaMKK , which activates CaMKI and CaMKIV but not CaMKII ) to determine which CaMK isoform is tightly involved in ES - induced p - CREB . Cultured DRGNs were treated with CaMKs inhibitor for 30 min and subjected to ES for 30 min . The ES - induced p - CREB was blocked in cells treated with KN93 compared to cells treated with vehicle control ( DMSO ) ( P < 0 . 05 ) ( Fig 4A ) . Similarly , the ES - induced p - CREB was strongly blocked in cells treated with KN62 compared to cells treated with DMSO ( P < 0 . 05 ) ( Fig 4B ) . The ES - induced p - CREB was not affected in cells treated with STO609 compared to cells treated with DMSO ( Fig 4C ) . We also detected the expressions of other CaMK family members ( CaMKK / CaMKI / CaMKIV ) in DRGNs . Western blot and immunostaining were used to assess the expression of these proteins in culture DRGNs . Western blot analysis showed that there were no differences between the protein levels of CaMKK / CaMKI / CaMKIVprior to and after ES conditions ( Fig 5A – 5C ) , and immunostaining assay showed that the DRGNs used in this study do express CaMKK , CaMKI , and CaMKIV ( Fig 5D – 5F ) . The above results indicate that CaMKII , but not CaMKK , is involved in ES - induced p - CREB . Studies have shown that CaMKII is involved in the regulation of gene expression and den - drite growth [ 40 , 41 ] . Multiple isoforms of CaMKII have been identified in eukaryotes [ 42 ] .

Similarly , CaMKII β shRNA strongly suppressed CaMKII β expression ( Fig 6C ) . The ES - induced p - CREB was significantly suppressed by the transduction of CaMKII β shRNA compared to control shRNA ( P < 0 . 05 ) ; although 30 min ES was still able to induce p - CREB in cells transduced with CaMKII β shRNA ( P < 0 . 05 ) ( Fig 6D ) . HF ( 0 . 3 μM ) was used to examine whether the suppression of p - CREB induced by CaMKII knockdown can be reversed . Data showed that HF significantly up - regulated the level of p - CREB compared to knockdown of CaMKII α or CaMKII β ( P < 0 . 05 ) . These results indicate that both CaMKII α and CaMKII β are required for ES - induced p - CREB . CaMKII and CaMKK are both required for ES - induced neurite outgrowth We further examined the contributions of CaMKs to ES - induced neurite outgrowth in cultured DRGNs . When DRGNs were pretreated with KN93 or KN62 , ES - induced neurite outgrowth was markedly suppressed ( P < 0 . 05 ) ( Fig 7A ) . After incubation with STO609 , ES - induced neurite outgrowth was also suppressed in DRGNs compared to the ES + / DMSO group ( P < 0 . 05 ) ( Fig 7A ) .

Knockdown of CaMKII α or CaMKII β partially blocked ES - induced neurite outgrowth ( P < 0 . 05 ) ( Fig 7B ) . Application of BDNF ( 10 ng / ml ) and HF ( 0 . 3 μM ) both reversed the inhi - bition on neurite outgrowth induced by CaMKII α and CaMKII β ( P < 0 . 05 ) ( Fig 7B ) . More - over , ES induced neurite outgrowth in the ES + / CaMKII α shRNA or CaMKII β group compared to the ES - / CaMKII α shRNA or ES - / CaMKII β shRNA group , separately ( P < 0 . 05 ) ( Fig 7B ) . These results suggest that CaMKII α and CaMKII β are both required for ES - induced neurite outgrowth in DRGNs . Both CaMKII α and CaMKII β are required for ES - induced BDNF mRNA transcription KN93 , KN62 and STO609 were used to determine which CaMK isoform is involved in ES - induced BDNF mRNA transcription and neurite outgrowth . When DRGNs were treated with KN93 or KN62 , ES - induced BDNF mRNA transcription was suppressed ( P < 0 . 05 ) ( Fig 7C ) . After incubation with STO609 , ES - induced BDNF mRNA transcription was unaffected ( P > 0 . 05 ) ( Fig 7C ) . Treatment of cells with the combination of ES and KN93 or KN62 pro - moted ES - induced BDNF mRNA transcription ( P < 0 . 05 ) ( Fig 7C ) compared to KN93 or KN62 treatment only . The results showed that CaMKII , but not CaMKK , was involved in ES - induced BDNF mRNA transcription . We next tested which isoform of CaMKII is involved in BDNF mRNA transcription induced by ES . The qPCR analysis showed that both CaMKII α shRNA and CaMKII β shRNA significantly blocked ES - induced BDNF mRNA transcription ( P < 0 . 05 ) ( Fig 7D ) . Moreover , the BDNF mRNA level was still up - regulated in either the ES + / CaMKII α shRNA or ES + / CaM - KII β shRNA group compared to the respective ES - / CaMKII α shRNA or ES + / CaMKII β shRNA group ( P < 0 . 05 ) ( Fig 7D ) . The results indicate that CaMKII α and CaMKII β play criti - cal roles in ES - induced BDNF mRNA transcription in DRGNs . The changes in BDNF levels were consistent with the changes in BDNF mRNA levels ( Fig 7E and 7F ) . Discussion It has been established that ES induces BDNF transcription and neurite outgrowth accompa - nied by an elevation of intracellular Ca 2 + in rat DRGNs [ 5 ] . It is unclear whether the Ca 2 + ele - vation is involved in ES - induced BDNF transcription and neurite outgrowth . The current study aimed to identify a signaling pathway mediating ES - induced neuronal activation initiated by Ca 2 + elevation . We showed that Ca 2 + blockers inhibited ES - induced p - CREB , BDNF tran - scription , and neurite outgrowth , and that knockdown of CREB suppressed ES - induced neuro - nal activation . We further showed that CaMKII , specifically , both CaMKII α and CaMKII β subunits , but not CaMKK , was required for ES - induced p - CREB . We propose that the novel signaling pathway of Ca 2 + - CaMKII - CREB plays a crucial role in ES - induced BDNF transcrip - tion and neurite outgrowth in cultured rat DRGNs . ES is one of the most effective approaches for depolarizing the membrane potential of neu - rons and stimulating gene expression .

ES increases Ca 2 + levels and activates nerve growth factor in ES - responsive Schwann cells in vitro [ 28 , 46 ] . Ca 2 + , a critical second messenger , is involved in many intracellular molecular signaling cascades [ 47 , 48 ] . Previous studies have shown that Ca 2 + plays important roles in regulating neurite extension triggered by extracellular factors , such an chemicals , neurotrophin or physical stimulation [ 5 , 49 , 50 ] . In the developing central nervous system ( CNS ) , Ca 2 + regulates neurite extension and retraction and axon guidance [ 51 – 53 ] . The signaling pathways that mediate Ca 2 + - dependent phosphorylation of CREB , which thereby regulates gene transcription , have been intensively investigated . Previous studies have demonstrated that there are other CREB regulators . It is reported that nerve growth factor ( NGF ) - regulated extracellular regulated kinase ( ERK ) phosphorylation triggers CREB phos - phorylation , which recruits the CREB binding protein ( CBP ) to the NGF promoter regions of cAMP - responsive genes related to neuronal morphology change , synaptic plasticity , and den - dritic spine growth [ 54 ] . In addition to ERK / mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) , vari - ous signaling cascades can phosphorylate CREB , including CaMKs [ 55 ] , phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) / Akt [ 56 ] , cAMP - dependent protein kinase A ( PKA ) [ 57 ] , and protein kinase C ( PKC ) [ 58 ] . One of the most important genes regulating neuronal activity is BDNF [ 59 ] . BDNF is involved in the regulation of axonal regeneration , dendritic outgrowth , and synaptic plasticity [ 60 ] . Studies show that BDNF combined with suboptimal levels of NGF suppresses the growth of sympathetic neurons to sprout neurites in vitro [ 61 ] . The outgrowth of rat superior cervical ganglion explants cultured with uterine horns of BDNF - / - mice in the absence of estrogen ( E 2 ) is slowed compared to wild - type [ 62 ] . In transgenic mice over - expressing BDNF , axons avoid regions with high expression of BDNF protein [ 63 ] . The reduced BDNF , due to a mutation of the BDNF allele , indicates the absence of an inhibitory influence on sympathetic sprouting [ 61 ] . Therefore , BDNF is widely recognizedas an important mediator of axon regrowth under the conditions of genetic modification . Reduced CREB activity inhibits BDNF expression [ 8 ] . Given BDNF’s importance for ner - vous system development and function , the mechanisms by which Ca 2 + regulates CREB and how CREB family members activate BDNF transcription and translation need to be further studied . It is critical to characterize the mechanisms by which BDNF mRNA levels regulate neuronal activity ( e . g . neurite outgrowth or synaptic formation ) . In addition , calcium - respon - sive transcription factor ( CaRF ) is an important mediator for BDNF activity regulated by cal - cium influx in neurons ; however , the detailed mechanism of CaRF and the relative signaling pathways are still undefined [ 64 ] . Another finding showed that 3 , 6’ - Disinapoyl sucrose - trig - gered regulation of BDNF gene expression was associated with CREB - dependent BDNF tran - scription and upstream molecular activation of CaMKII and ERK1 / 2 in SH - SY5Y cells [ 10 ] . CREB is activated by the Ca 2 + and CaMK pathway , specificallyCaMKIV in the cortical neu - rons [ 8 ] . On the contrary , another study showed that CaMKII negatively regulated p - CREB and thus repressed BDNF expression through promoter region III [ 65 ] . CaMKII is one of the most critical regulators of axon regeneration and neurite regrowth [ 66 , 67 ] . CaMKII β is more capable of promoting neurite outgrowth than CaMKII α in mouse Nb2a neuroblastoma cells [ 67 ] . Saito et al . [ 68 ] found that knockdown of CaMKII β suppressed BDNF - induced neuritogenesis of cortical neurons in the rat at embryonic day 18 , but knock - down of CaMKII α did not affect neuritogenesis , indicating that there was difference in expres - sion between CaMKII α and CaMKII β in the early developmental stage of cortical neurons . However , studies report that CaMKII overexpression suppresses neurite regrowth induced by dibutyryl cyclic AMP or NGF [ 66 , 69 ] . CaMKII / CREB MediatesES - Induced NeuriteOutgrowth PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0162784 September9 , 2016 16 / 22 Ca 2 + - induced CaMK activation in primary cultured neurons triggers phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133 , 142 , and 143 , which are all necessary for Ca 2 + - induced intracellular gene tran - scription [ 70 ] . It has been found that CREB phosphorylation at Ser142 and Ser143 contributes to CREB activation , and that mutations of Ser142 and Ser143 to alanines inhibits Ca 2 + - induced CREB - dependent transcription , while CREB phosphorylation at Ser142 alone reduced the transcriptional activation [ 65 , 70 ] . However , data obtained from recent in vivo studies implies that the mechanism could be much more complicated . Gau et al . [ 71 ] developed transgenic mice with a CREB Ser142 - to - Ala mutation , and found that the transgenic mice had a changed circadian clock , which may lead to down - regulation of c - Fos , a transcription factor regulated by CREB . The effects of cAMP on transcription - dependent axon growth have been attributed to the activation of CREB [ 72 ] . To assess the role of CREB in neurite growth , Ma et al . [ 73 ] expressed a constitutively active CREB fusion protein ( referred to as CREB - CA ) and a dominant - negative CREB protein ( referred to as CREB - DN ) . CREB - CA enhanced basal neurite growth on both Fig 8 .

Interestingly , CREB - CA showed marked synergy with Bt 2 cAMP , causing a greater than additive increase in neurite growth on MAG - CHO cells . The Bt 2 cAMP - mediated neurite growth persisted in neurons expressing CREB - DN . These results imply that , although activation of CREB - dependent gene expression can by itself promote neurite growth , it is not necessary for cAMP - triggered growth , which signifies the existence of an alternative growth - promoting pathway downstream of cAMP . The current findings together with a previous report [ 5 ] support our working hypothesis that ES induces an increase in [ Ca 2 + ] i through Ca 2 + influx through L - and N - type voltage - dependent calcium channels , and calcium mobilization from inositol triphosphate - 3 receptor ( IP3R ) - sensitive calcium stores and ryanodine receptor ( RYR ) - sensitive calcium stores . The initial rise in [ Ca 2 + ] i activates downstream CaMKII , which subsequently triggers CREB phos - phorylation , thereby promoting BDNF gene expression and neurite outgrowth ( schematic shown in Fig 8 ) . These findings provide clues to further understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of nerve regeneration promoted by ES . Our findings indicate that ES has clinical relevance for improving functional recovery after nerve injury , although the mechanism of ES - induced nerve repair and regeneration still require further investigation . Additionally , this study indicates that CaMKK may be involved in ES - induced neurite outgrowth , possibly via a CREB - independent signaling pathway . Future studies will investigate the role of CaMKK in ES - induced neurite outgrowth in neuronal cells .
