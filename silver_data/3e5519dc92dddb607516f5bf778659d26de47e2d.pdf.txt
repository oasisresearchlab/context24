P olarized assembly of actin ﬁlaments is pivotal in cell motility and is orchestrated by proteins that target ﬁlament barbed ends 1 . Formins bind barbed ends and accelerate ﬁlament elongation from proﬁlin - actin ( PA ) in a processive fashion 2 – 4 . In contrast , capping protein ( CP ) blocks ﬁlament growth upon its binding to barbed ends . Both proteins together regulate cell migration 5 – 8 . Formins and CP are thought to bind the barbed end of a ﬁlament in a mutually exclusive fashion , that is , each protein prevents the other from binding the barbed end of the actin ﬁlament 9 – 12 . Bulk solution assembly assays 9 demonstrated that formin had to remain bound to the barbed end during at least 10 cycles of actin assembly to account for the protection against capping . However , it was also noted , but not explained , that the barbed - end protection by formin depended on the relative amounts of CP and formin . In addition , Romero et al . 3 showed that Gelsolin arrested propulsion of formin - coated beads in a concentration - dependent fashion and that the afﬁnity of CapG for barbed ends reached a lower limit at saturating levels of formin , at variance with the unlimited decrease expected for mutually exclusive binding . These data suggested that the two proteins simultaneously bind barbed ends 3 . However , the underlying molecular mechanism and kinetic details have so far remained elusive . Formin and CP individually dissociate extremely slowly from barbed ends 3 , 13 , which raises intriguing questions regarding the regulation of ﬁlament length in formin - based motile processes . Given the dwell times of formins at the barbed ends ( approximately tens of minutes ) obtained from in vitro experiments 14 , formin - based cellular processes should reach lengths of several tens of microns before formin detachment . Yet in ﬁlopodia , bundles of actin ﬁlaments assembled at 30 – 500 nm s (cid:2) 1 ( ref . 15 ) by processive polymerases such as formin mDia2 or Ena / VASP proteins 16 – 20 , reach lengths of a few microns . Similar to Bud14 , which displaces formin Bnr1 ( ref . 21 ) in yeast , a mechanism to reduce formin dwell times at the barbed end in eukaryotes must exist . In contrast to previously held views 22 , CP has recently been reported to be present in ﬁlopodia 8 . This ﬁnding prompted us to take a fresh look at the presumed competition between CP and formin at ﬁlament barbed ends . Here we show that CP and formin mDia1 can together bind to actin ﬁlament barbed ends in a ternary complex in which CP acts as an uncompetitive inhibitor of formin . The dynamics of formin and CP in complex with the barbed end have been analysed using microﬂuidics - assisted single - ﬁlament assay 23 , 24 . The ternary complex has been further visualized using single - molecule ﬂuorescence imaging . The mutually weakened binding of CP and formin to barbed ends promotes rapid displacement of formin from barbed ends by CP and uncapping of CP by formin . We propose CP and formins as potential novel cross - regulators of each other in cellular organelles like lamellipodia , cytokinetic ring and ﬁlopodia , where the two proteins are known to play a vital role . Results Two set - ups reveal interplay of formin and CP at barbed ends . We have analysed the interplay of mDia1 FH1 – FH2 – DAD and CP at barbed ends of individual actin ﬁlaments using a home - built microﬂow - based set - up 25 . In rest of the text the notation ‘mDia1’ refers to FH1 – FH2 – DAD domains of formin mDia1 , unless otherwise speciﬁcally mentioned . Similarly FMNL2 refers to the FH1 – FH2 - WH2 - DAD domains of formins FMNL2 . Filaments were either initiated from immobilized spectrin – actin seeds , exposing their distal barbed ends to PA , formin or CP at deﬁned concentrations ( set - up # 1 ) , or from surface - anchored formins , initiating insertional processive barbed - end assembly from PA and CP ( set - up # 2 ) . The two set - ups are complementary to each other . The ﬁrst set - up allows us to monitor the changes in barbed - end elongation rate caused by the association of CP ( C ) or formin to a free barbed end ( B ) , and by association of one of the two proteins to a barbed end bound to the other one . We can further monitor the evolution of barbed - end dynamics following removal of formin and CP . The second set - up , where the formin is anchored ( BF ) , allows us to observe the change in elongation rate due to the binding of CP to a formin - bound barbed end and quantify its evolution into a CP - bound or a formin - bound barbed end in absence of the two proteins . Three input ﬂows are used , each consisting of a speciﬁc biochemical composition , for example , PA ( ﬂow 1 ) , formin ( ﬂow 2 ) and CP with PA ( ﬂow 3 ) . The biochemical conditions can be changed in less than a second 24 . Analysis of the kymographs of large number of ﬁlaments at varying CP and formin concentrations allow studying molecular mechanisms with high accuracy . In other words , the method enables single - molecule kinetics without the need of labelling individual protein molecules . CP binds to formin - bound barbed ends in a ternary complex . Using set - up # 1 ( Fig . 1a ) , ﬁlaments were elongated from glass - anchored spectrin – actin seeds in the presence of PA , the freely ﬂoating end being the barbed end ( B ) . Exposure to a ﬂow containing mDia1 ( F ) alone led to the formation of a formin - bound barbed end ( BF ) . On subsequent exposure to PA alone , fast processive assembly was observed . Formin - bound ﬁlaments ( BF ) were then exposed to a ﬂow of CP and PA in the absence of mDia1 . The fast processive growth of ﬁlaments was arrested by CP , surprisingly at a much faster rate than if binding of CP was rate limited by the very slow dissociation of formin , which would be expected for a mutually exclusive binding scheme ( Fig . 1b , c ) . The ﬁrst - order rate constant at which growth was arrested in contrast increased linearly with CP concentration , consistent with a simple bimolecular reaction ( Fig . 1d ) , indicating that CP binds formin mDia1 - bound barbed ends ( BF ) and arrests their growth in a Barbed end - Formin - CP complex ( BFC ) state , as described by the following scheme : BF þ C ! k 0þ C BFC . CP effectively caps the barbed end in the BFC state . Note that 100 % of the BF ﬁlaments ( total n ¼ 80 – 100 ﬁlaments ) was converted into the arrested BFC complex after exposure to CP . The BFC ﬁlaments , when exposed to a ﬂow containing only PA ( no free CP and no free formin ) , partitioned into two populations . In all , 30 % of BFC ﬁlaments rapidly resumed fast processive assembly ( indicative of formin - based elongation ) , the remaining ones slowly resumed typical free barbed - end growth from PA . We conclude that in the capped BFC complex both CP and mDia1 interact with the barbed end via the terminal actin subunits , without any direct interaction with each other ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . The BFC complex either undergoes dissociation of CP leading to formin - mediated fast processive assembly ( BFC ! k 0(cid:2) C BF þ C ) , for which a single expo - nential was recorded ( k 0 (cid:2) C ¼ 1 . 8 ± 0 . 07 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 3 s (cid:2) 1 ; Table 1 ) , or dissociation of mDia1 restoring the CP - capped state ( BC ) that then slowly releases CP , leading to free barbed ends ( BFC ! k 0(cid:2) F BC þ F ! k (cid:2) C B þ C þ F ) . Figure 1b shows a kymograph of a ﬁlament paused in a BFC state that resumes elongation in the BF state on dissociation of CP . Note that only the outcome BFC - BF þ C can be readily observed using set - up # 1 , as BC produced by BFC - BC þ F is undistinguishable from BFC . Nevertheless , the simplest interpretation of the fact that only up to 30 % of BFC dissociates into BF is that 70 % of BFC follows the pathway BFC - BC þ F , as observed later using set - up # 2 . Further evidence for arrested barbed - end growth in the ternary BFC complex was obtained from single - molecule microscopy ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms9730 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 6 : 8730 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms9730 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications & 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Filaments nucleated from spectrin – actin seeds were transiently exposed to ﬂuorescently labelled mDia1 ( B þ F * - BF * ) . When the BF * ﬁlaments were exposed to a ﬂow containing CP and PA , barbed - end growth was arrested while the ﬂuorescent formin stayed bound to the barbed end , thus conﬁrming that CP and mDia1 were simultaneously bound to the barbed end . On CP removal from the ﬂow , the BF * C ﬁlament exposed to PA switched back to rapid elongation . This established that the same formin molecule stayed bound to the barbed end before , during and after the pause ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Movie 1 ) . Labelling of mDia1 did not affect the rate of processive elongation ( 44 . 2 ± 6 . 3 and 45 . 3 ± 7 . 3 subunits per second at 1 m M actin , 4 m M proﬁlin , for unlabelled and labelled formin , respectively ; n ¼ 50 ﬁlaments ) . Tests to check step bleaching conﬁrmed that labelled formins were indeed single molecules and not aggregates ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . While single - molecule imaging provides qualitative demonstration of the ternary barbed - end formin – CP complex , the low labelling fraction of formins ( B 5 % ) prevent quantitative measurements . The kinetic analysis of CP binding to BF was therefore performed using unlabelled actin - binding proteins . The value of the rate constant for CP association to formin - bound barbed ends was k 0 þ C ¼ 0 . 21 ± 0 . 01 m M (cid:2) 1 (cid:4) s (cid:2) 1 , as derived from the linear increase in the pseudo ﬁrst - order rate constant measured for the reaction BF þ C - BFC versus CP concentration ( Fig . 1d , Supplementary Fig . 3 and Table 1 ) . The rate constants for association of formin and CP to free barbed ends were similarly derived ( Supplementary Figs 4a and 5a , respectively , and Table 1 ) . Either CP or formin dissociate rapidly from the BFC complex . Formation of the ternary BFC complex was tested using set - up # 2 ( Fig . 2a ) , which may mimic the condition in which the formins are activated and immobilized at a membrane . In contrast with set - up # 1 , set - up # 2 allows us to clearly distinguish the capped BFC state ( attached ﬁlament ) from the capped BC state ( detached ﬁlament , lost in the ﬂow ) and the BF state ( resumption of fast elongation ) . 0 100 200 300 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 F r a c t i on o f f o r m i n - bound f il a m en t s pau s ed Time ( s ) 30s 30s 5 μ m PA * Profilin ( P ) PLL - PEG coated coverslip Formin ( F ) Capping protein ( CP ) Spectrin actin seed Flow a PA * F PA * + CP PA * B B BFC BC BF 0 100 200 0 . 00 0 . 02 0 . 04 k ′ + C ob s ( s – 1 ) [ CP ] ( nM ) k ′ + C = 0 . 21 μ M – 1 s – 1 Actin ( A * , labelled ) 5 μ m PA * FCP CP F * 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 6 b c d Figure 1 | CP associates to mDia1 formin - bound barbed ends in a capped ternary BFC complex that releases either formin or CP .

The higher green background appears to stay for slightly longer ( B 30s ) even after formin is removed from the ﬂow due to non - speciﬁc interaction of formin with the surface . Formin can be seen bound to the barbed end in the paused state in the BF * C complex as a result of exposure to PA þ CP . Fast processive elongation resumes when CP falls off ( BF * C - BF * þ C ) and the same formin continues to processively track the barbed end ( Supplementary Movie 1 ) .

Since the monomer addition takes place in an insertional fashion between the formin and the pre - existing ﬁlament , the ﬂuorescent segment appears to move away from the immobilized formin as non - ﬂuorescent monomers get added at the barbed end by anchored formins 25 .

The measured value k 0 þ C ¼ 0 . 08 ± 0 . 0012 m M (cid:2) 1 (cid:4) s (cid:2) 1 is slightly lower than the one derived from set - up # 1 ( 0 . 21 ± 0 . 01 m M (cid:2) 1 (cid:4) s (cid:2) 1 ) . The difference might result from the anchoring of the formin as well as the use of labelled actin in set - up # 1 and unlabelled actin in set - up # 2 . The rate constant for association of CP to formin - bound barbed ends ( k 0 þ C ) was two orders of magnitude lower than for CP binding to free barbed ends ( k þ C ; Table 1 ) . k 0 þ C was also found to be identical at two different PA concentrations ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . On exposure of arrested BFC ﬁlaments to PA , the BFC ﬁlaments partitioned into detached BC ﬁlaments and rapidly growing BF ﬁlaments ( Fig . 2b ) . The low ﬂow rate prevented ﬁlament detachment due to viscous drag . In addition , formin - anchored ﬁlaments spontaneously detach from formins at a rate which is orders of magnitude lower ( Table 1 ) . It was further conﬁrmed that ﬁlament detachment was due to the dissociation of the capped barbed end from the formin , and not due to the dissociation of formin from the surface ( mediated by the strong neutravidin – biotin link ) . This point was veriﬁed by renucleating new ﬁlaments from the anchored formins from which ﬁlaments had detached following BFC formation . These formins were able to re - nucleate new ﬁlaments ( Supplementary Fig . 7 and Supplementary Movie 2 ) . The kinetics of dissociation of BFC into BC and BF was exponential with rate constant k obs ¼ k 0 (cid:2) F þ k 0 (cid:2) C ( Fig . 2c ) . The ﬁnal fractions of ﬁlaments in BF and BC states are k 0 (cid:2) C / ( k 0 (cid:2) C þ k 0 (cid:2) F ) and k 0 (cid:2) F / ( k 0 (cid:2) C þ k 0 (cid:2) F ) , respectively ( see equations 1 – 3 in Methods section ) . Kinetic analysis of the fraction of ﬁlaments in BFC , BF and BC states provided values of 6 . 34 ± 0 . 09 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 3 s (cid:2) 1 and 2 . 02 ± 0 . 04 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 3 s (cid:2) 1 for k 0 (cid:2) F and k 0 (cid:2) C , respectively . Superimposable curves for BFC - BF were obtained with both set - ups ( Fig . 2c , open and closed red symbols ) . Although dissociation of CP from BFC is not directly measured , but inferred from the formation of rapidly elongating BF , the truly monoexponential formation of rapidly elongating BF state rules out a kinetic scheme in which rapid dissociation of CP would lead to an intermediate inactive ( non - growing ) BF 0 state of the barbed end , followed by the actually monitored slower structural re - arrangement leading to active BF . Note also that following exposure to PA only , the evolution of 100 % BFC is well - described by the partition between two functionally characterized states BF and BC . No evidence was detected for a second inactive BF 0 state occurring in a side reaction . Thus , dissociation of CP from BFC leaves formin readily active at the barbed end . In conclusion , formin dissociates 78 - fold faster from CP - bound barbed ends than from free barbed ends ( k (cid:2) F ¼ 8 . 1 ± 0 . 35 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 5 s (cid:2) 1 , Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . The monoexponential time courses of BF appearance are reasonably superimposable in set - up # 1 and set - up # 2 . Two important conclusions are arrived at . First , anchoring of formin to the glass surface does not affect BFC dynamics ( Fig . 2c ) . Second , the same partitioning of BFC into BC and BF is monitored with both set - ups , hence the rate constants k 0 (cid:2) C and k 0 (cid:2) F for CP and formin dissociation from BFC can be derived from kinetic analysis of data from set - up # 1 as well as from set - up # 2 using equations ( 1 – 3 ) ( see Methods section ) , even though no direct measurement of k 0 (cid:2) F is obtained in set - up # 1 . The large decrease in afﬁnity of CP for barbed ends due to bound formin is mainly caused by a 60 - fold decrease in association rate ( only 9 – 10 - fold increase in dissociation rate in both set - ups ) . The apparently very slow association rate constant of CP to BF is suggestive of a two - step binding , rapid equilibrium followed by a slower structural re - arrangement enhancing the strength of binding . Formin binds to CP - capped ﬁlaments to form a BCF complex . We then investigated if mDia1 could also associate to CP - capped barbed ends to form a ternary BCF complex and if BCF is bio - chemically equivalent to BFC . This was ﬁrst tested in bulk solution assays by diluting ( 50 - fold ) Pyrenyl - labelled CP - capped ﬁlaments in F - buffer containing PA ( Fig . 3a ) . The dilution decreased the concentration of free CP to o 100 pM , thus making the re - binding of CP to barbed ends following its dissociation negligible . Expectedly , capped ﬁlaments failed to grow sig - niﬁcantly in the presence of 2 m M PA . However , when mDia1 was added to the mix of capped ﬁlaments and PA , processive actin polymerization occured and caused an acceleration , in conditions where mDia1 nucleation is negligible ( Fig . 3a ) . The acceleration matches the time course of CP displacement by formin . No such acceleration was observed when rapid uncapping was elicited by CIN85 , a conventional uncapper of the CapZIP family 26 , 27 , thus this control curve bends downward in a conventional ﬁrst - order growth process ( Fig . 3a ) . This result provides qualitative indication that mDia1 binds capped barbed ends and uncaps CP , promoting fast growth , before CP has time to dissociate spontaneously ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . When dilution - induced disassembly of the same CP - capped ﬁlaments was tested in F - buffer containing proﬁlin only , no uncapping by mDia1 was observed . In contrast , CIN85 did promote uncapping and proﬁlin - enhanced barbed - end disassembly ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . Single - ﬁlament assay was then used to quantify formin - based uncapping . The formation and outcome of the BCF state was performed and analysed as follows . A population of B 0 ﬁlaments were grown from immobilized spectrin – actin seeds ( set - up # 1 ) and 100 % capped by CP . These ﬁlaments were exposed to formin for a given duration T expo . Both the concentration of formin [ F ] and incubation period T expo were varied , leading to various resulting amounts of BCF via the reaction BC þ F ! k 0þ F BCF . Following the incubation period T expo of BC with F , PA was ﬂown in at time zero , allowing a fraction of the preformed BCF ﬁlaments to convert into fast - growing BF state . A kymograph of a BCF ﬁlament evolving into BF is shown in Fig . 3b . Note that following exposure to F , this ﬁlament remains in the arrested BCF state for several seconds when exposed to PA alone , before fast processive assembly starts . We assume that during the period T expo , the reaction BC - B þ C , which is very slow , can be neglected , as well as the reactions BCF - BC þ F and BCF - BF þ C ( which is veriﬁed a posteriori , see below ) . The fraction of the initial capped B 0 ﬁlaments that converted to BCF state was thus equal to ð 1 (cid:2) e (cid:2) k 0þ F F ½ (cid:5) T expo Þ . The conversion of BCF ﬁlaments into BF is described by equation ( 2 ) ( see Methods section ) , providing a value of ( k 0 (cid:2) C þ k 0 (cid:2) F ) identical to the one found in Fig . 2 . At sufﬁciently long time of exposure to PA ( t - N ) , the fraction of B 0 ﬁlaments in the BF state plateaued at a value that depends on the concentration of formin [ F ] and exposure time T expo ( Fig . 3c and Supplementary Fig . 9 ) , as described by the following equation : BF t ! 1 ð Þ = B 0 ¼ k 0 (cid:2) C = k 0 (cid:2) C þ k 0 (cid:2) F (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:5) : 1 (cid:2) e (cid:2) k 0þ F F ½ (cid:5) T expo (cid:6) (cid:7) The values of k 0 þ F and k 0 (cid:2) C were derived from the ﬁt of the data using this equation ( Fig . 3d ) . We have thereby determined that k 0 þ F ¼ 1 . 6 ± 0 . 5 m M (cid:2) 1 (cid:4) s (cid:2) 1 . Values found for the dissociation rate constants of CP and formin from the BCF state were k 0 (cid:2) C ¼ 6 . 2 ± 1 . 1 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 3 s (cid:2) 1 , and k 0 (cid:2) F ¼ 6 . 2 ± 1 . 1 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 3 s (cid:2) 1 ( Table 1 ) , in satisfactory agreement with values found for dissociation of CP and formin from the BFC complex .

This simpliﬁcation is justiﬁed by o 5 % detectable BF ﬁlaments at time t ¼ 10 s following exposure to PA ( Fig . 3c ) . This result is in agreement with bulk solution measurements indicating that the dissociation of CP by formin ( BCF - BF þ C ) requires PA ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . In conclusion , CP and formin can together bind barbed ends irrespective of their order of binding . The afﬁnities of both CP and formin for the barbed end are reduced by three orders of magnitude in the ternary BFC / BCF complex , which expresses the uncompetitive inhibition of formin activity by CP . The kinetic parameters of the ternary complex obtained by binding F to BC or C to BF are comparable ( Table 1 ) . The energetic costs for formation of the ternary complex via binding of F to BC or C to BF were calculated using the average values of equilibrium dissociation constants derived from rate parameters ( Table 1 ) . We ﬁnd that K C (cid:4) K 0 F B K F (cid:4) K 0 C , expressing detailed balance . FMNL2 formin also binds CP - capped ﬁlaments . Is formation of a BFC / BCF ternary complex an exclusive feature of mDia1 or does it represent a conserved , general behaviour of formins ? FMNL2 is another Rho GTPase - activated , mammalian formin that localizes , as CP , in lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia 28 . FMNL2 and CP were tested for their simultaneous binding to barbed ends . FMNL2 by itself poorly nucleates actin ﬁlaments and binds barbed ends with lower afﬁnity than mDia1 , yet it processively elongates barbed ends in the presence of PA with a twofold increase in ﬁlament growth rate 28 . Formation of the ternary BFC complex with the FMNL2 formin was tested using set - up # 1 . Fast processive growth of FMNL2 - bound barbed ends was rapidly arrested on exposure to CP . However , no fast elongation was seen to resume when CP was removed from the ﬂow , possibly due to low afﬁnity of FMNL2 for the barbed ends causing very fast dissociation of FMNL2 on CP binding . We therefore tested the formation of the ternary BCF complex starting from capped BC ﬁlaments . Filaments growing from spectrin – actin seeds were capped by CP , and subsequently exposed to varying concentration of FMNL2 for different exposure times . The rate constant for formin FMNL2 association to a capped barbed end ( k 0 þ FMNL2 ) was calculated as described for formin mDia1 in Fig . 3c , d . A typical kymograph of a CP - capped paused ﬁlament switching to formin - based fast elongation on exposure to 250nM FMNL2 is illustrated in Fig . 4a .

All rights reserved . the capped ﬁlament , following 30s exposure to FMNL2 , started fast processive elongation only after being exposed to PA for 45s . This result indicates that at the end of the 30s incubation of the capped ﬁlament with FMNL2 , the barbed end was in the BCF and not in the BF state . FMNL2 behaves like mDia1 in Fig . 3b . Thus the data rule out a simple competition scheme between CP and FMNL2 . Expectedly , the number of BC ﬁlaments that switch to BF ﬁlaments changes as the formin concentration is varied at constant exposure time ( Fig . 4b ) , or as both are varied ( Supplementary Fig . 10 and Fig . 4c ) . The derived association rate constant of FMNL2 to BC ﬁlaments is k 0 þ FMNL2 ¼ 0 . 115 m M (cid:2) 1 (cid:4) s (cid:2) 1 , 13 times lower than free barbed ends ( k þ FMNL2 ¼ 1 . 54 m M (cid:2) 1 (cid:4) s (cid:2) 1 , Supplementary Fig . 11 ) . As expected , the value of k obs ¼ k 0 (cid:2) C þ k 0 (cid:2) FMNL2 was found to be independent of the experimental conditions ( k obs ¼ 0 . 01407 ± 0 . 00153 s (cid:2) 1 ) . Using equations ( 1 – 3 ) ( see Methods section ) we calculate k 0 (cid:2) C ¼ 4 . 7 ± 0 . 51 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 3 s (cid:2) 1 and k 0 (cid:2) FMNL2 ¼ 9 . 4 ± 1 . 0 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 3 s (cid:2) 1 ( N BF / B 0 ¼ 0 . 334 ± 0 . 026 ) . Note that CP dissociates at very similar rate from BCF state for both mDia1 and FMNL2 . In summary , FMNL2 , like mDia1 , binds a CP - bound barbed end and displaces CP from the barbed end . However , a much higher concentration of FMNL2 than mDia1 is required to uncap , possibly due to the lower afﬁnity of FMNL2 for the barbed end . Consistently , pyrene polymerization assays show modest uncapping activity of FMNL2 ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) . In conclusion , formation of a ternary BFC complex is not restricted to formin mDia1 .

The CP ab heterodimer binds the two terminal actin subunits ( B1 and B2 ) of actin ﬁlament barbed ends in the helical , 167 (cid:2) - twisted conﬁguration of F - actin 30 , 31 . Recent EM data at 4 Å resolution conﬁrm this structural organization in the CapZ - capped dynactin ﬁlament 34 . In contrast , nonpolymerizable actin subunits are oriented in the FH2 - actin crystal structure in a helical 180 (cid:2) pseudo F - actin conﬁguration 32 , a conformation that presumably prevents the formation of main CP barbed - end contacts . Molecular dynamics studies provided insights into the BF complex in a 167 (cid:2) - twisted ﬁlament 35 . To challenge the simultaneous interaction of formin and CP with the standard helical ﬁlament barbed end , the mDia1 - FH2 dimer ( chains FH2 1 and FH2 2 ) was superimposed in the ‘open’ state on the two terminal barbed - end protomers . This ‘open’ state has been proposed to be adopted during G - actin association 4 . Most of the FH2 - actin contacts are conserved in the 167 (cid:2) - F - actin context , in particular those made by the FH2 knob region , a main actin - binding element . When this structure is superimposed on the BC complex structure , steric clashes appear between CP b and the post region of the FH2 1 protomer . In addition , while a strong steric conﬂict takes place between the b - tentacle of CP and the knob region of FH2 1 , the main electrostatic interactions of CP a with B1 and B2 are not impaired ( Fig . 5a – c ) . We tentatively propose the following structural rearrangements to resolve the above mentioned steric conﬂicts . In the ternary BFC complex , the hydrophobic cleft of the terminal subunit B1 can be occupied by the knob of the FH2 1 protomer , while the CP’s b - tentacle remains unbound ( Supplementary Fig . 13 ) . This proposal is based on the low afﬁnity of CP found here for BF , which is consistent with the reported 300 - fold weakening of CP binding on removal of the b - tentacle . In contrast , the removal of the a - tentacle , abolishes binding 13 , 31 . In this putative BFC state , the strong bonds formed by ab - CP with B1 and B2 might maintain the capping activity of CP and promote the partial dissociation of FH2 1 from B1 , thereby weakening the binding of the FH2 without affecting the contacts between FH2 2 and F - actin ( Supplementary Fig . 13 ) . The ﬂexibility of mDia1 due to its long linker region , may as well enable binding of formin to a CP - capped barbed end . Mutual weakening of the interface of each protein with F - actin might facilitate dissociation of BFC into BF and BC ( Fig . 5d ) . The destabilization of formin – actin interactions by CP should also facilitate force - induced dissociation of formin from BFC . The exposure of the post region of FH2 1 may allow some interaction with G - actin , facilitating the displacement of CP from BFC . The displacement of formin from barbed ends by CP can also be accounted for within this model , since the strong electrostatic interactions between CP and free barbed ends 30 are unaffected by prior formin binding . The model is schematically summarized in Fig . 5d .

( a ) Steric clashes between CP and mDia1 - FH2 in the BFC complex . The 167 (cid:2) - twisted F - actin barbed end is depicted as surface representation ( 4A7N ) , while the a / b heterodimeric CP 30 and the dimeric mDia1 - FH2 domain ( 3O4X ) are illustrated in ribbon diagrams . The FH2 domain hemidimers ( FH2 1 and FH2 2 ) are shown in the previously deﬁned ‘open’ state 4 , 32 and bind with an amphipathic a - helix ( a D ( ref . 32 ) , orange , knob region ) to the hydrophobic target - binding cleft ( TBC ) of actin . CP interacts with its amphipathic b - tentacle ( b T , yellow ) with B1 , while the basic a - tentacle ( a T ) binds to B1 and B2 . ( b , c ) Zoom - in of the clashes . The a - tentacle of CP is able to interact with B1 and B2 of F - actin , while there is a steric clash between CP b and the post region of FH2 1 ( clash 1 ) . FH2 1 competes with CP for binding to B1 - TBC ( clash 2 ) . Since CP b and a D of FH2 2 are in close proximity , there might be a minor steric hindrance for simultaneous binding to actin B2 ( clash 3 ) .

Similarly CP can associate with BF without inserting the b - tentacle in B1 - TBC ( bottom ) . For the detailed model , see Supplementary Fig . 13 .

As a result , they exhibit higher dissociation rates , which is key to the rapid displacement of one regulator by the other . Single - ﬁlament kinetics and single - molecule ﬂuorescence explain the rapid arrest of propulsion of formin - coated beads and detach - ment of formin - induced bundles 3 , and provide the kinetic characterization of the molecular mechanism for CP and formin interaction dynamics with the barbed end in the ternary BFC complex . At the current resolution of optical microscopy , it is not possible to ascertain the exact position and mechanism of interaction of the two molecules at the barbed face of F - actin terminal subunits . Hence the insight provided by biochemical function , which reﬂects deﬁned protein – protein interactions , is crucial and precedes a structural study at atomic resolution . We ﬁnd that on binding to formin - bound barbed ends , CP retains its capping activity in the BFC state while its dissociation from barbed ends , monitored by resumed processive elongation by formin , is enhanced by the presence of formin . We do not directly monitor the dissociation of CP from BFC . However , the fact that the system is well - described by a ﬁrst - order process of conversion of the ternary complex into only two states , BF and BC , indicates that dissociation of CP from BFC is kinetically coupled to the formation of active BF . The rates of formin and CP dissociation from BFC / BCF are roughly independent of their order of addition to barbed ends , as well as the values of the thermodynamic parameters K 0 C and K 0 F . The derived isoenergetic square is reasonably balanced . The functional biochemical evidences strongly suggest that in the ternary BFC / BCF state , both CP and formin maintain a fraction of their original contacts with the two terminal actin subunits . Notably , the dynamics of CP and formin have been mainly monitored in the presence of PA ( except for k 0 þ F ) but may differ in the absence of actin and with proﬁlin only . More extensive investigations are required to establish the full array of rate constants for interaction of formin itself and its interplay with CP in regimes of growth ( ATP - bound terminal subunits ) and depolymerization ( ADP - bound terminal subunits ) . In spite of its lower afﬁnity for barbed ends ( even lower for CP - bound barbed ends ) , FMNL2 also forms a ternary complex with CP . Since the FH2 domain is conserved among diaphanous - related formins ( Supplementary Fig . 14 ) , the ability of formins and CP to simultaneously bind barbed ends may have general signiﬁcance . The displacement of formin from the barbed end by CP may have implications in the regulation of ﬁlament length . Filament bundles in ﬁlopodia are initiated by a cluster of mDia2 formins 36 , 37 , which in vitro rapidly assemble tens of microns long ﬁlaments before detaching . Nevertheless , ﬁlopodia are only a few micrometres long , which indicates that formin activity is regulated by other proteins . The recent evidence for CP being responsible for the tapered morphology of ﬁlopodia tips 8 , 38 brings support to the view that CP causes formin detachment , as follows . If we consider a typical bundle of a few tens of ﬁlaments , and assume a typical CP concentration of the order of 100 nM , we ﬁnd that the population of elongating ﬁlaments steadily decreases down to few ﬁlaments in few minutes . Over that time , the bundle ( that is , in a ﬁlopodium ) growing at a typical rate of 100 nm (cid:4) s (cid:2) 1 ( ref . 39 ) can reach a length of a few microns ( see Supplementary Fig . 15 and its caption for details ) . Therefore , the measured rate at which a formin - bound barbed end is capped is compatible with what can be observed in ﬁlopodia in vivo 22 , 39 . Is the ability of formin to uncap CP from ﬁlament barbed ends physiologically relevant ? Uncappers such as CARMIL and proteins of the CapZIP family ( CIN85 / CD2AP , CKIP - 1 and the WASH - associated FAM21 protein ) mediate rapid CP dissociation from the barbed ends , often in a site - directed fashion , suggestive of their ability to capture CP - capped ﬁlaments 40 , 41 . Uncapping of CP is mediated by multimeric WH2 proteins such as VopF ( ref . 42 ) and Ena / VASP , also involved in ﬁlopodia formation 22 . As FH2 and WH2 domains share binding sites on the barbed face of actin , formin and WH2 proteins might use similar mechanisms to displace CP . CP is the major barbed - end capper in ﬁlopodia of migrating cells 8 . Eps8 , another capper 43 is also found in axonal ﬁlopodia of hippocampal neurons 44 and uses the same structural element as WH2 domains , formins , CapG , gelsolin and CP in its actin - binding mode 45 . Our results suggest that Eps8 and other proteins may rapidly displace formins from the barbed ends and vice versa . In conclusion , CP plays a dual function in motile processes . CP helps maintaining a large pool of polymerizable monomeric actin 46 , which is essential for rapid site - directed actin poly - merization , thus facilitating protrusive activities . Consistently , CP - depleted cells display short ﬁlopodia 8 . Here we propose a novel role for CP in regulating formin - based processes by limiting the dwell time of formin at barbed ends . Conversely , formin can bind a capped barbed end and restore its fast growth by displacing CP . The kinetic information provided here set the stage for in vivo investigations of functional interactions of CP and formin in organelles like ﬁlopodia . Methods Proteins . Actin was puriﬁed from rabbit muscle and pyrenyl - or Alexa488 succinimidyl ester - labelled ( on lysines ) using standard procedures . Proﬁlin , CP , spectrin – actin seeds and the FH1 – FH2 – DAD domain of human formin mDia1 were expressed and puriﬁed 3 . Spectrin – actin seeds were biotinylated 25 . SNAP – FH1 – FH2 – DAD – His plasmid of mDia1 ( ref . 47 ) ( kindly provided by David Kovar , University of Chicago , IL ) , was bacterially expressed in Escherichia coli cells ( BL21 ) and puriﬁed through HisTrap and gel ﬁltration columns . Biotinylation or Alexa488 labelling of formin was done by reacting benzylguanine – biotin or benzylguanine – Alexa488 with SNAP - mDia1 ( FH1 – FH2 – DAD ) following standard vendor procedure ( NewEngland Biolabs ) . The C - terminal FMNL2 construct carrying the terminal eight consecutive proline residues in the FH1 domain , ampliﬁed from the FMNL2 cDNA ( NP _ 443137 . 2 ) by PCR , was cloned into Sal I and Not I sites of pGEX - 6P - 3 containing a N - terminal GST tag . GST – FH1 ( 8P ) – FH2 – C plasmid of FMNL2 ( ref . 28 ) ( kindly provided by Jan Faix ) was expressed in E . coli Rosetta ( DE3 ) and puriﬁed through GST Trap and size - exclusion ( Superdex 200 16 / 60 ) chromatography . The CIN85 construct , ampliﬁed from the Cin85 cDNA ( NP _ 114098 . 1 ) by PCR , was cloned in a modiﬁed pGEX - 6P1 expression vector containing a C - terminal Strep - tag II and an N - terminal histidine – thioredoxin fusion tag . The protein was expressed in E . coli Rosetta ( DE3 ) cells and puriﬁed to 98 % purity through HisTrap chromatography , precision cleavage of the his – thioredoxin tag , StrepTrap and size - exclusion ( Superdex 200 16 / 60 ) chromatography . The uncapping activity of CIN85 was monitored spectroﬂuorimetrically by measuring the restoration of barbed - end growth of CP - capped ﬁlaments from G - actin ( 2 m M , 2 % pyrenyl labelled ) in a range of CIN85 concentrations . The CIN85 concentration used in the assays provided about 70 – 80 % uncapping . Bead assay for testing CP binding to formin mDia1 . Biotin - functionalized polystyrene beads ( Polysciences Inc . ) were washed in G - buffer ( 5mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 8 , 0 . 2mM ATP , 0 . 1mM CaCl 2 and 1mM DTT ) , incubated with 0 . 5mgml (cid:2) 1 neutravidin for 15min , washed twice with 50 (cid:3) excess volume G - buffer and incubated with 500nM biotinylated mDia1 formin for 1h . Following two washing steps as above , the mDia1 - functionalized beads were split into two samples : one was loaded on the gel directly ( Supplementary Fig . 1 , lane 2 ) and the other was further incubated with 500nM CP for 1h . The beads were centrifuged . The supernatant with unbound CP was submitted to SDS – PAGE ( lane 6 ) . The beads were washed twice with G - buffer as above , and submitted to SDS – PAGE ( lane 3 ) . All incubations were done with 0 . 1 % bovine serum albumin present to prevent non - speciﬁc binding of mDia1 and CP to the beads . All reactions were carried out at 4 (cid:2) C . The gel was Coomassie Blue stained . Single - ﬁlament microscopy .

First , the coverslip surface was functionalized and passivated using a 1 : 40 PLL - PEG - Biotin : PLL - PEG mixture ( SuSos ) at 1mgml (cid:2) 1 in PBS , for 30min at room temperature . The chamber was rinsed and further incubated with 10 m gml (cid:2) 1 neutravidin in PBS for 5min . Filaments were then initiated either from biotinylated spectrin – actin seeds exposing their barbed ends in a distal position to PA , CP or formin , or from immobilized biotinylated SNAP - mDia1 ( FH1 – FH2 – DAD ) formin with their pointed ends in a distal position , thus allowing insertional ﬁlament assembly 25 . Actin was 10 % Alexa488 - labelled in assays where ﬁlament pointed ends were anchored by spectrin – actin seeds . When ﬁlaments were assembled from immobilized formin ( anchored growing barbed ends ) , ﬁlaments were initiated with 15 % Alexa488 - labelled actin , then elongated from unlabelled actin and their dynamics were monitored 25 . All experiments were carried out at room temperature in F - buffer ( 5mM Tris - Cl (cid:2) pH 7 . 8 , 0 . 2mM ATP , 1mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2mM EGTA , 50mM KCl , 10mM DTT and 1mM DABCO ) . Standard polymerization conditions are 1 m M actin and 4 m M proﬁlin . Microscopy data acquisition and analysis . Actin ﬁlaments were imaged on three different microscopes . Most experiments were performed on an Olympus IX71 microscope equipped with a (cid:3) 60 objective and a Cascade II EMCCD camera ( Photometrics ) ; Anchored formin renucleation activity after CP exposure ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) were performed on a Nikon TE - 2000U microscope equipped with a (cid:3) 60 objective and a sCMOS OrcaFlash2 . 8 camera ( Hamamatsu ) controlled by m Manager ; Experiments for the determination of the k 0 þ F for mDia1 ( Fig . 3c , d ) were performed on an ELYRA microscope ( Zeiss ) with a (cid:3) 100 objective ( numerical aperture 1 . 46 ) and an iXon 897 ( Andor ) camera from the ImagoSeine imaging platform ( Institut Jacques Monod , Paris ) . Experiments were conducted in epiﬂuorescence ( mercury lamp , typical exposure duration : 500ms ) or in TIRF ( typical exposure : 100ms ) at a maximal frame rate of three images per second . Images were analysed using the ImageJ Kymograph plugin . One actin subunit contributes to 2 . 7nm of the ﬁlament length . Background ﬂuorescence was subtracted automatically using the built - in rolling - ball background subtraction algorithm ( rolling - ball radius 20 pixels ) . Typically at least 80 – 100 ﬁlaments were monitored in a ﬁeld of view and 100 % of these ﬁlaments were counted in the cumulative distribution functions ( CDFs ) showing the time course of the various complexes . The fraction of ﬁlaments showing a change in growth behaviour ( arrest of growth , switch from slow to fast processive growth and so on ) on addition of formin or CP or PA to the ﬂow were plotted versus time to generate cumulative distributions . The kinetics of disappearance of BFC ( or BCF ) linked to formation of BF and BC were analysed using the simple kinetic scheme ( Fig . 2 ) BFC ! k 0(cid:2) C BF þ C BFC ! k 0(cid:2) F BC þ F The system is described by the following differential equations d BFC ð Þ = d t ¼(cid:2) BFC k 0(cid:2) F þ k 0(cid:2) C (cid:2) (cid:3) d BF ð Þ = d t ¼ k 0(cid:2) C BFC ð Þ d BC ð Þ = d t ¼ k 0(cid:2) F BFC ð Þ BFC , BF and BC all vary exponentially with rate constant ( k 0 (cid:2) F þ k 0 (cid:2) C ) . The value of k 0 (cid:2) F and k 0 (cid:2) C was derived from the relative fraction of ﬁlaments in BF and BC states as follows : BFC t ð Þ = BFC 0 ¼ e (cid:2)ð k 0(cid:2) C þ k 0(cid:2) F Þ t ð 1 Þ BF t ð Þ = BFC 0 ¼ð k 0(cid:2) C k 0(cid:2) C þ k 0(cid:2) F Þ(cid:3)ð 1 (cid:2) e (cid:2)ð k 0(cid:2) C þ k 0(cid:2) F Þ t Þ ð 2 Þ BC t ð Þ = BFC 0 ¼ð k 0(cid:2) F k 0(cid:2) C þ k 0(cid:2) F Þ(cid:3)ð 1 (cid:2) e (cid:2) k 0(cid:2) C þ k 0(cid:2) F ð Þ t Þ ð 3 Þ Hence N BF / N BC ¼ k 0 (cid:2) C / k 0 (cid:2) F . All experiments were performed at least four times with various preparations of actin , CP , proﬁlin and formin . The values of rate parameters given in Table 1 are representative of several measured values . On - rates and off - rates of CP and formin on free barbed ends . The association rate constant for formin , k þ F was measured by exposing the ﬁlaments growing in PA ﬂow to a ﬂow containing varying concentrations of formin along with PA . CDFs calculated for ﬁlaments that switched from slow elongation to fast elongation ( B þ F ! k þ F BF ) , were used to measure the on - rate of formin on the barbed end ( k þ F ) as follows . The CDFs were analysed in terms of single pseudo exponentials ( k obs ) at various concentrations of formin . The association rate constant k þ F was derived as the slope of the linear increase in k obs with formin concentration . To measure the off - rate of formin , fast - elongating ﬁlaments ( BF ) were observed in presence of PA until they switched to slow elongation ( B ) . The CDF for these ﬁlaments ( BF ! k (cid:2) F B þ F ) was ﬁtted with an exponential function to obtain k (cid:2) F ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Similarly , the association rate constant of CP for barbed ends , k þ C , was derived from analysis of the CDF of ﬁlaments going from slow elongation ( B ) to complete pause in the presence of PA and at various con - centrations of CP ( B þ C ! k þ C BC ) . k (cid:2) C was measured from the CDF of paused ﬁlaments ( BC ) switching to slow elongation in the presence of PA and absence of CP in the ﬂow ( BC ! k (cid:2) C B þ C ; Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . mDia1 does not aggregate following ﬂuorescent labelling . SNAP - mDia1 - Alexa488 molecules , non - speciﬁcally attached on the coverslip , were exposed continuously to the acquisition laser and TIRF images were acquired at fast frame rate ( three images per second ) . The bleaching experiments were conducted in buffer without DABCO 47 . A circle of 1 m m diameter was drawn around each spot and the integrated intensity of this area was measured using ImageJ . The average local background of all spots was measured and subtracted from each integrated intensity measurement . Majority of the spots showed either a single - or double - step bleaching proﬁle , consistent with the dimeric nature of mDia1 ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . mDia1 remains anchored and active after exposure to CP . Presence and activity of biotin - SNAP - mDia1 speciﬁcally anchored to PEG passivated glass coverslip in microﬂuidics ( set - up # 2 ) are probed by exposing them alternatively to a nucleation condition ( F - buffer at 25mM KCl , 2 m M 20 % Alexa488 actin and 0 . 4 m M proﬁlin ) and observation condition ( F - buffer at 100mM KCl , 1 m M unlabelled actin and 4 m M proﬁlin ) for 15s each . One frame is acquired every 30s . The localization and the time of newly formin - nucleated ﬁlaments are recorded . This allows us to localize individually all formins spots on the surface . In the control experiment , we measured the time needed for a randomly chosen sub - population of formins to nucleate a second ﬁlament after having detached their ﬁrst nucleated ﬁlaments , to obtain the cumulative distribution of formin renucleation with time ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . In a second experiment , formins that elongate ﬁlaments ( BF ) are exposed to 400nM CP to get BFC ﬁlaments and a randomly chosen sub - population of the formins that released their ﬁlaments after CP exposure ( that is , BFC - BC þ F ) are tracked and subjected to a renucleation experiment similar to the control case described above . This leads to the cumulative distribution of formin renucleation with time after CP exposure ( Supplementary Fig . 7 and Supplementary Movie 2 ) . Bulk solution measurements . Barbed - end growth was monitored using pyrenyl - labelled actin ﬂuorescence changes . A solution of 5 m M F - actin ( 2 % pyrenyl labelled ) and 5nM CP was used as seeds . These capped ﬁlaments were diluted 25 – 50 - fold in F - buffer containing G - actin ( 2 % pyrenyl labelled ) , proﬁlin , formin and CIN85 as indicated . Changes in pyrenyl - actin ﬂuorescence were monitored using a Safas Xenius spectroﬂuorimeter . Structural model of CP and mDia1 - FH2 bound to barbed ends . For structure display and structural modelling of the proposed BFC state , we used the PYMOL Molecular Graphics System ( http : / / www . pymol . org ) and the following available structural information regarding CP and FH2 interactions with actin : crystal structure of CP 29 , the structure of CP bound to barbed ends from cryo - EM 30 , under consideration of molecular dynamics studies 31 , the F - actin cryo - EM structure ( PDB : 4A7N ) , the crystal structure of mDia1 - FH2 domain ( PDB : 3O4X ) and of TMR - labelled G - actin bound to Bni1 - FH2 ( ref . 32 ) taking into account recent molecular dynamics analysis 48 . Structural information of the following studies was further considered : crystal structures of the FH2 domain of mDia1 ( ref . 49 ) , F - actin cryo - EM structure 50 and of TMR - G - actin bound to FMNL3 - FH2 ( ref . 51 ) . The FH2 domain of the yeast formin Bni1 builds a doughnut - shaped head - to - tail dimer and it has earlier been crystallized as a continuous chain around a 180 (cid:2) twisted pseudo ﬁlament 32 . The main contacts between CP ab and actin at the interface of the B1 and B2 actin protomers are not ( fully ) established in this pseudo F - actin conﬁguration . In the model proposed here for the ternary BFC complex , the actin coordinates of one Bni1 - FH2 / G - actin heterodimer ( PDB : 1Y64 ) were superimposed in the previously deﬁned ‘open’ state on the backbone C a atoms of the terminal actin subunits B1 and B2 , respectively , of the helical , 167 (cid:2) - twisted F - actin ﬁlament ( PDB : 4A7N ) . Monomeric mDia1 - FH2 domains including the C terminal , elongated a T - helix and the DAD domain ( PDB : 3O4X ) were superimposed on the backbone C a coordinates of Bni1 - FH2 to generate an mDia1 - bound F - actin barbed end . Finally , the F - actin barbed end in complex with CP ( PDB data kindly provided by Y . Maeda ) was superimposed on the protein backbone C a atoms of the terminal G - actin subunit B1 ( PDB : 4A7N ) of the formin - bound actin ﬁlament . In this Electron Microscopy ( EM ) structure of BC , the CP b subunit binds with its amphipathic b - tentacle to the hydrophobic target - binding cleft between subunit 1 and 3 of the B1 actin protomer , while the basic a - tentacle of the CP a subunit forms electrostatic interactions at the interface of B1 and B2 at the barbed end . To gain a better overview , the linker and lasso regions of mDia1 - FH2 were not included into the illustration of the steric clashes in Fig . 5a – c . For the BFC model depicted in Supplementary Fig . 13 , the lasso ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms9730 10 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 6 : 8730 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms9730 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications & 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

This BFC model does not contain atom clashes and is in agreement with polypeptide geometry . References 1 . Bugyi , B . & Carlier , M . F . Control of actin ﬁlament treadmilling in cell motility .
