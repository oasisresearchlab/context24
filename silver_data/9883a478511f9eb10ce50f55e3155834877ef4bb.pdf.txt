Integrin activation has been shown to involve binding of the talin FERM domain to membrane proxi - mal sequences in the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin (cid:1) - sub - unit . However , a second integrin - binding site ( IBS2 ) has been identified near the C - terminal end of the talin rod . Here we reportthecrystalstructureofIBS2 ( residues1974 – 2293 ) , which comprises two five - helix bundles , “IBS2 - A” ( 1974 – 2139 ) and “IBS2 - B” ( 2140 – 2293 ) , connected by a continuous helix with a distinct kink at its center that is stabilized by side - chain H - bonding . Solution studies using small angle x - ray scattering and NMR point to a fairly flexible quaternary organization . Using pull - down and enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays , we demonstrate that integrin binding requires both IBS2 domains , as does binding to acidic phospholipids and robust targeting to focal adhesions . We have defined the membrane proximal region of the integrin cytoplasmic domain as the major binding region , although more membrane distal regions are also required for strong binding . Alanine - scanning mutagenesis points to an important electrostatic component to binding . Thermal unfolding experiments show that integrin binding induces conformational changes in the IBS2 module , which we speculate are linked to vinculin and membrane binding . Talin ( (cid:1) 270 kDa ) is one of a number of adaptor proteins ( including (cid:1) - actinin , filamin , tensin , ILK , skelemin , and melusin ) that couple the integrin family of cell adhesion mole - cules to the actin cytoskeleton ( 1 ) . However , it appears thus far to be unique in providing the necessary final step to integrin ( “inside - out” ) activation . Talin is composed of a head region ( residues 1 – 400 ) containing an extended FERM domain , a linker region ( residues 401 – 481 ) of unknown structure , and finally a long helical rod ( residues 482 – 2541 ) , in which (cid:1) 62 (cid:1) - helices are organized into a tandem series of (cid:1) 12 – 13 mostly 5 - helix bundles ( 2 , 3 ) . The C - terminal helix is a principal medi - ator of talin dimerization , forming an antiparallel 2 - helix coiled - coil ( Fig . 1 ) . The FERM subdomain F3 has a phosphotyrosine - binding domain - like fold ( 4 , 5 ) that binds to and sequesters the cyto - plasmic tail of the integrin (cid:2) - subunit , activating integrins in a two - step process that requires interaction with acidic mem - brane phospholipids . In the first step of activation , F3 makes critical interactions with the “mid - section” of the integrin tail , comprising a W XXXX NPLY XX A motif ( residues 739 – 752 in (cid:2) 3 ) . Trp - 739 ( it is Phe in integrin (cid:2) 2 ) inserts its side chain into a well defined hydrophobic pocket made up of residues Arg - 358 , Ala - 360 , and Tyr - 377 near to the membrane - proximal sur - face of F3 , whereas the NP X Y motif forms a helical turn that nestles into a shallow groove at the membrane distal end of the F3 subdomain ; the intervening residues form (cid:2) - sheet interac - tions with the edge of the (cid:2) 6 - strand of F3 . In the second step , F3 engages the membrane - proximal helix of the (cid:2) - integrin as well as the membrane itself . This is believed to cause the separation of the (cid:1) - and (cid:2) - integrins tails , which releases the quaternary constraints that hold the integrin in its low affinity conforma - tion . This sets in motion or potentiates conformational changes that are transduced across the plasma membrane to the extra - cellular domains , promoting high affinity binding to matrix proteins or counter - receptors on other cells ( 6 , 7 ) . Consistent with this two - step model , talin mutants that bind normally to the integrin mid - section of the (cid:2) - integrin tail but are defective in binding either to the membrane - proximal helix , or the mem - brane itself , have a dominant - negative phenotype . Other cell adhesion molecules bind competitively to the region in F3 where it engages the mid - section of integrin tails , utilizing vari - ants on the integrin motif . Such molecules include the phos - phatidylinositol phosphate kinase - type 1 (cid:3) , which engages via a C - terminal motif ( WVYSPLH ) ( 8 , 9 ) ( in which Ser rather than Asn serves as the N - cap to the helical turn ) , as well as two * Thisworkwassupported , inwholeorinpart , byNationalInstitutesofHealth CellMigrationConsortiumGrantU54GM64346fromNIGMS .

A . 8866 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 284•NUMBER 13• MARCH 27 , 2009 sequences in the cytoplasmic domain of layilin ( a hyaluronan receptor ) , one observed experimentally ( WVENEIY ) ( 10 ) and another predicted ( FVTNDIY ) ( 11 ) . In these non - integrin cases , the sequence binds in a canonical phosphotyrosine - bind - ing domain - peptide mode , and the shorter intervening sequence allows for tighter packing of the NP X Y motif or its homolog against F3 ; however , none of these molecules activates integrin ( 12 , 13 ) . The talin rod contains at least two binding sites for F - actin ( 14 ) , the best characterized of which is at the C terminus ( 15 , 16 ) , as well as numerous potential binding sites for the cytoskel - etal protein , vinculin ( 3 , 17 ) , which is recruited by talin to sta - bilize nascent focal adhesions ( 18 , 19 ) . Interestingly , the talin rod contains a binding site for the muscle - specific intermediate filament protein (cid:1) - synemin ( 20 ) , thus providing a potential link between integrin - talin - actin complexes and the intermediate filament network . Evidence has also slowly accumulated for the existence of an additional integrin - binding site , IBS2 , 2 in the talin rod . Initial indications that the rod contained such a site came from gel filtration studies ( 21 ) . More recently , Xing et al . ( 22 ) showed that purified rod captured in microtiter wells bound (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 integrin in a dose - dependent manner and that an antibody to the talin rod blocked (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 binding to intact talin by only (cid:1) 50 % . Moreover , (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 integrin bound to a recombi - nant talin fragment from the C - terminal region of the rod ( res - idues 1984 – 2541 ) but not to an N - terminal rod fragment ( 434 – 1975 ) . Surface plasmon resonance studies also showed that the talin rod bound to (cid:2) 3 - integrin tails , although the affinity was (cid:1) 40 - fold weaker than that of the talin head ( 23 ) . Tremuth et al . ( 24 ) further localized the binding site in the rod to residues 1984 – 2113 , using a combination of pulldown and surface plas - mon resonance assays . They also reported that binding was inhibited by a mutation of the integrin NP X Y motif ( Y 3 A ) , as observed for the talin head . Subsequently , Moes et al . ( 25 ) iden - tified a 42 - residue talin fragment ( residues 2072 – 2113 ) that co - localized with integrin in focal adhesions , and a 23 - residue pep - tide ( residues 2077 – 2099 ) that bound GST - (cid:2) 3 integrin tails in a blot assay . However , none of these rod fragments was able to activate integrin when transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells . Further evidence in support of a second integrin - binding site in talin has come from elegant studies in Drosophila ( 26 ) . As predicted , an Arg - 367 3 Ala mutation in the Drosophila talin FERM F3 domain ( equivalent to mouse Arg - 358 ) abro - gated recruitment of the talin head to integrin - containing mus - cle attachment sites ; furthermore , a full - length talin R367A mutant was unable to support the development of talin - null embryos to adulthood . However , the R367A mutant was able to partially rescue the talin - null phenotype in adult flies . Similarly , in embryos , the R367A mutant rescued the talin - null pheno - type in various tissues , including muscle , and was recruited to integrin - containing junctions . However , close analysis showed that the muscle ends had pulled away from their matrix attach - ment sites , indicating a reduction in adhesion strength . It is well established that both the affinity of individual integrins and the avidity of clustered integrins for matrix proteins contribute to the overall strength of adhesion . The observations can there - fore be rationalized by postulating that , although the Drosoph - ila R367A mutant is unable to induce affinity changes , it retains the ability to support integrin clustering at cell - matrix junc - tions . The authors of this work suggested a model in which the talin head and rod serve distinct functions : the head converts integrins to the high affinity state , while the rod contributes to integrin clustering via its IBS2 function ( 26 ) . We have previously determined the structures of the two domains flanking IBS2 , the “VBS3” domain , residues 1843 – 1973 ( 27 ) , and the C - terminal actin - binding module , residues 2300 – 2482 ( 16 ) . Here we describe the structure of the interven - ing fragment ( 1974 – 2293 ) comprising IBS2 . The structure reveals a tandem pair of five - helix bundles forming a functional module . The N - terminal bundle has been implicated in integrin binding ( 24 , 25 ) , but we show that both domains are required for high affinity binding . Moreover , both domains of the mod - ule are required for focal adhesion localization and for binding to acidic phospholipids . We map the regions of the (cid:2) - integrin tail critical for IBS2 binding and show that both membrane - 2 The abbreviations used are : IBS2 , integrin - binding site 2 ; GST , glutathione S - transferase ; SeMet , selenomethionine ; SAXS , small angle x - ray scatter - ing ; ELISA , enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ; PBS , phosphate - buff - ered saline ; GFP , green fluorescent protein ; DSC , differential scanning cal - orimetry ; r . m . s . d . , rootmeansquaredeviation ; Vd1 , vinculind1domain ; FA , focal adhesion ; Fmoc , 9 - fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl .

Together , these results suggest that the two major integrin - binding sites on talin share many common features but have distinct functions . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Protein Expression and Purification —The cDNAs encoding murine talin residues 1974 – 2293 , 1974 – 2140 , and 2137 – 2293 were synthesized by PCR using a mouse talin1 cDNA as tem - plate and cloned into expression vector pET - 151 / D - TOPO ( Invitrogen ) . Constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 Star ( DE3 ) , cultured either in LB or , for preparation of 15 N - labeled samples for NMR , in minimal media containing 1 g of 15 N - ammonium chloride per liter . Recombinant His - tagged talin 1974 – 2293 was expressed in E . coli B834 strain for selen - omethionine ( SeMet ) incorporation , and cultured in appro - priate minimal media . Recombinant His - tagged talin poly - peptides were purified by nickel - affinity chromatography following standard procedures . The His tag was removed by cleavage with AcTEV protease ( Invitrogen ) , and the protein was further purified by anion - exchange chromatography . Recombinant His - tagged chicken vinculin domain 1 ( resi - dues 1 – 258 ) was expressed using a pET - 15b expression plas - mid and purified as described previously ( 28 ) . The concen - tration of purified proteins was determined using the CB - Protein Assay ( Calbiochem ) . X - ray Crystallography —Crystals of talin residues 1974 – 2293 were obtained at 19 °C by vapor diffusion equilibration against 10 % ( w / v ) polyethylene glycol 8000 , 100 m M HEPES , 1 % ( w / v ) polyethylene glycol 3350 , 10 m M sodium thiocyanate at pH 7 . 5 . Protein at 5 . 0 mg / ml in 0 . 2 M NaCl , 2 m M dithiothreitol , and 20 m M Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , was mixed with an equal volume of pre - cipitant . Crystals adopt space group P2 1 , but two distinct forms were observed . Native protein yielded Form 1 crystals , with 1 molecule per asymmetric unit , whereas SeMet crystals yielded Form 2 crystals containing 2 molecules per asymmetric unit ( see Table 1 ) , with solvent contents of 47 % and 45 % , respec - tively . The two forms are closely related in their crystal packing , but there is a near doubling of the c - axis in Form 2 to accom - modate the second molecule . Diffraction data were collected from native crystals ( Form 1 ) at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline ID23 - 1 , and from SeMet crystal ( Form 2 ) at beamline 14 - 4 , recorded on ADSC Q315R charge - coupled device detectors . Data were pro - cessed with DENZO and SCALEPACK ( 29 ) . Phases were deter - mined from the anomalous data collected at the selenium absorption peak ( (cid:4) (cid:2) 0 . 9791 ) from SeMet Form 2 crystals . 10 of the 12 possible selenium atoms were located ( 6 per molecule ) , and a map was constructed using these preliminary phases at 2 . 5 - Å resolution . An initial atomic model was built using SOLVE / RESOLVE ( 30 ) , and , following phase improvement with DM ( 31 ) , the model was rebuilt manually with Coot ( 32 ) and refined using maximum likelihood refinement in Refmac5 ( 33 ) . Subsequently , the structure was refined against a new 1 . 85 - Å data set collected from Form 2 SeMet crystals . The final model converged to an R WORK of 21 . 4 % for all data between 20 and 1 . 85 Å , and an R free of 26 . 0 % . The final Ram - achandran plot shows 96 . 9 % of residues in favored regions , 2 . 8 % in additional favored regions , and 0 . 2 % in generously allowed regions , as defined by PROCHECK ( 34 ) . The structure has been submitted to the Protein Data Bank with the accession number 3dyj ( www . rcsb . org ) . The figures were generated with CCP4mg ( 35 ) . The Form 1 native crystals did not diffract as well as the SeMet derivatives , and the data were partially refined to an R free of 23 . 7 % . Gel Filtration and Proteolysis —Analytical gel filtration chromatography of recombinant talin fragments 1974 – 2293 , 1974 – 2140 , and 2137 – 2293 , as well as vinculin Vd1 - ( 1 – 258 ) , was performed using Superdex - 75 ( 10 / 300 ) GL ( Amersham Biosciences ) at room temperature . The proteins were mixed and incubated at various temperatures for 30 min prior to load - ing onto the column , which was pre - equilibrated with and run with 20 m M Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 150 m M NaCl , and 2 m M dithiothreitol at a flow rate of 0 . 8 ml / min . All proteolysis experiments were carried out at 20 °C for 1 h using a 1 : 50 ( w / w ) trypsin : protein ratio . The buffer was 150 m M NaCl , 20 m M Tris , pH 8 . 0 . SAXS —Small angle x - ray scattering ( SAXS ) experiments were carried out at station 2 . 1 of the U . K . Synchrotron Radia - tion Source at Daresbury , using a multiwire gas detector cover - ing a momentum - transfer range of 0 . 02 Å (cid:3) 1 (cid:4) q (cid:4) 0 . 70 Å (cid:3) 1 , where q (cid:2) 4 (cid:5) sin (cid:5) / (cid:4) ( 2 (cid:5) is the scattering angle and (cid:4) the x - ray wavelength , 1 . 54 Å ) . Measurements on talin 1974 – 2293 were performed at 4 °C at concentrations of 2 and 10 mg / ml in a buffer comprising 20 m M sodium phosphate , pH 6 . 5 , 50 m M NaCl , and 2 m M dithiothreitol . Experimental data were accu - mulated in 60 - s frames , and , before averaging , frames were inspected for x - ray - induced damage or aggregation . The back - ground was subtracted using the scattering from the buffer solution alone . No protein aggregation was detected , and the linearity of the Guinier plot ( supplemental Fig . S1 ) indicated that the protein solutions were homogeneous . Data reduction was carried out with software provided at the Daresbury facil - ity , and subsequent analysis was done with the ATSAS program package ( 36 ) . The theoretical R g for the crystal structure of the IBS2 domain was calculated using Crysol ( 37 ) . NMR Spectroscopy —NMR spectra were collected using a 0 . 2 m M protein solution in 20 m M sodium phosphate buffer ( pH 6 . 5 ) , 50 m M NaCl , and 2 m M dithiothreitol at 298 K on a Bruker AVANCE DRX600 spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe . Spectra were processed and analyzed using TopSpin software ( Bruker ) . Binding of Integrin Tails to Talin Rod Using a Pulldown Assay — Purified talin rod fragments were diluted to 250 n M in PN buffer ( 10 m M PIPES , 50 m M NaCl , 150 m M sucrose , 50 m M NaF , 40 m M sodium phosphate , pH 6 . 8 ) . To assay for integrin binding , 700 (cid:6) l of protein solution was mixed ( incubated for 2 h at room temperature ) with 10 (cid:6) g of His - Avi - tagged integrin tails immo - bilized on NeutrAvidin - coated beads . Unbound proteins were removed by three washes in PN buffer containing 5 % Triton X - 100 , and bound proteins were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer and detected by Western blotting ( 38 ) . Mouse anti - V5 antibody ( Invitrogen ) was used to detect talin rod domains , and a rabbit Anti - His antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) was used to detect the talin head . Binding of Integrin Tails to Talin Rod by ELISA —Microtiter wells ( ELISA high binding plate , white , Fisher ) were coated with Structure of the Talin Rod Second Integrin - binding Site 8868 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 284•NUMBER 13• MARCH 27 , 2009 a solution of 10 (cid:6) g / ml NeutrAvidin ( Pierce ) and incubated with 150 (cid:6) l of blocking buffer ( 1 % heat inactivated - bovine serum albumin in PBS ) . Wells were then incubated with purified recombinant His - Avi - tagged integrin tails ( 2 (cid:6) g / ml ) diluted in PBS containing 1 % bovine serum albumin and 0 . 2 % Tween 20 ( sample buffer ) . Talin rod fragments ( 25 – 2500 n M ) in sample buffer were added to the wells , and bound talin was detected with primary mouse Anti - V5 antibody ( Invitrogen , ratio 1 : 5000 ) and a secondary goat anti - mouse horseradish peroxi - dase - conjugated antibody ( BIOSOURCE ) using luminescence with ECL ( Amersham Biosciences ) . All incubations were for 1 h at 37 °C in 50 (cid:6) l of buffer unless otherwise stated , and plates were washed three times with PBS containing 0 . 2 % Tween 20 after each step . Controls included wells without NeutrAvidin , NeutrAvidin without integrin , and wells coated with (cid:1) IIb - inte - grin . Integrin loading onto NeutrAvidin plates was quantitated using mouse 7H8 anti - helix monoclonal antibody , and some wells were coated with the talin fragments to verify equal load - ing of the various constructs . Expression of GFP - tagged Talin IBS2 Polypeptides in Vincu - lin - null Cells —Vinculin - null mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( 39 ) cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum with 2 m M L - glutamine were plated onto glass coverslips , and 24 h later transfected with cDNAs encod - ing various pEGFP - C2 - tagged mouse IBS2 polypeptides using FuGENE 6 ( Roche Applied Science ) , according to the manufac - turer’s instructions . Cells were fixed with pre - warmed para - formaldehyde ( 4 % ( w / v ) in PBS ) , permeabilized with 0 . 5 % Tri - ton X - 100 in PBS , and stained using a mouse monoclonal antibody to paxillin ( clone 349 , BD Biosciences , diluted 1 : 300 in 0 . 05 % Triton X - 100 in PBS ) followed by a goat anti - mouse con - jugated to AlexaFluor 568 fluorescent dye . Cells were imaged using an inverted Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope equipped with a 63 (cid:6) oil immersion lens ( numerical aperture (cid:2) 1 . 3 ) . Dig - ital images were processed in Adobe Photoshop CS2 . Phospholipid Binding —Phosphatidylinositol phosphate strips ( Invitrogen ) were treated at room temperature for 5 h with 3 % ovalbumin in TBS - T ( 10 m M Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 150 m M NaCl , 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ) to eliminate nonspecific binding , and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 (cid:6) g / ml talin fragments in TBS - T con - taining 3 % ovalbumin . After incubation , the strips were washed three times at room temperature in TBS - T containing 0 . 1 % ovalbumin , and talin binding was detected with a mouse anti - His horseradish peroxidase - conjugated antibody ( ratio 1 : 6000 , 1 h at room temperature , Alpha Diagnostics ) , followed by three washes in TBS - T . The signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence ( Pierce ) . SPOT Synthesis —Peptides ( 25 - and 36 - mers ) based on the mouse (cid:2) - integrin sequences were synthesized on a fully auto - mated SPOT synthesizer Multipep ( Intavis AG , Germany ) . The derivatization of hydroxyl groups of cellulose sheets ( Schleicher & Schuell , Germany ) was carried out with Fmoc - alanine , 1 - methylimidazole , and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in dimethyl formamide overnight . The peptides were then synthesized by repeated deposition of pre - activated amino acids onto derivat - ized cellulose sheets via Fmoc chemistry , using dicyclohexyl - carbodiimide / 1 - hydroxybenzotriazole activation of amino acids in N - methyl - 2 - pyrrolidone and Fmoc deprotection with 20 % ( v ) piperidine in dimethyl formamide . During the first three cycles of synthesis , residual amino groups and the final N - terminal amino groups were blocked with a mixture of 80 % acetic anhydride / 10 % N , N - diisopropylethylamine / 10 % di - methyl formamide ( v / v ) for 30 min . Finally , cleavage of side - chain protection groups was carried out in 95 % trifluoroacetic acid / 5 % dichloromethane ( v / v ) for 45 min . Typically , the load - ing of peptides was (cid:1) 100 nmol per spot . Talin IBS2 Binding to (cid:2) - Integrin SPOT - peptide Arrays — Membranes were treated overnight with 10 % fetal bovine serum in Tris - buffered saline ( 50 m M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 0 , 137 m M NaCl , 2 . 7 m M KCl ) . Murine talin fragment C ( residues 1975 – 2541 ) , N - terminally tagged with T7 & GFP , and C - terminally with His - 7 , was expressed using pET23A - T7 ( 40 ) and purified on nickel - nitrilotriacetic acid - Sepharose ( Qiagen ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Eluted protein was subjected to MonoQion - exchangechromatography ( AmershamBiosciences ) , and purified T7 / GFP - talin C was transferred into PBS . Mem - branes were overlaid for 2 h with T7 / GFP - talinC ( 1 (cid:6) M ) in Tris - buffered saline with 1 % bovine serum albumin at room temper - ature . Bound T7 / GFP - talin fragment C was detected using a monoclonal T7 antibody ( Novagen ) and alkaline phosphatase - coupled anti - mouse Ig ( Jackson Laboratories ) , as described previously ( 3 ) . Differential Scanning Calorimetry —DSC experiments were carried out using an NDSC II calorimeter ( CSC ) at a scanning rate of 1 K / min under 3 . 0 atm of pressure . Protein samples were exchanged into DSC buffer comprising 20 m M PIPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) and 100 m M NaCl . (cid:2) 1A - integrin peptides ( 47 - and 25 - mers ) were synthesized by Dr . Sven Rothemund ( Interd - isziplina¨res Zentrum fu¨r Klinische Forschung Leipzig ) , and also dissolved in DSC buffer . Protein samples were analyzed at 0 . 7 mg / ml with (cid:2) - integrin peptide at 100 or 200 (cid:6) M .

We determined initial phases using anomalous scattering from a selenomethi - onine derivative from Form 2 crystals ( see “Experimental Pro - cedures” ) at 2 . 5 - Å resolution , and subsequently collected a dif - fraction set to 1 . 85 - Å resolution for high resolution refinement ( Table 1 ) . The final high resolution model includes two copies of IBS2 ( residues 1975 – 2291 ) within the asymmetric unit . IBS2 comprises a tandem pair of five - helix bundles with the same topology , comprising five anti - parallel (cid:1) - helices ( ranging from 24 to 30 residues in length ) . Helices (cid:1) 2 – (cid:1) 5 and (cid:1) 7 – (cid:1) 10 are folded into left - handed up - down - up - down 4 - helix bundles . In both cases , a long 10 - residue linker connects the first and sec - ond helices ( i . e . (cid:1) 1 – (cid:1) 2 and (cid:1) 6 – (cid:1) 7 ) ; otherwise , the helices are connected by short loops ( Fig . 2 A and supplemental Fig . S2 ) . The two IBS2 five - helix bundles can be superposed using Coot ( 32 ) with an r . m . s . d . of 2 . 4 Å on backbone atoms ( supplemental Fig . S3 A ) . This bundle topology has only previously been seen ( DALI ( 41 ) ) in the five - helix bundle at the N termi - nus of the talin rod ( residues 482 – 655 ) ( 28 ) , and both IBS2 bundles superpose with this domain with an r . m . s . d . of (cid:1) 2 . 5 Å for backbone atoms ( supplemental Fig . S3 B ) . The two bundles are linked by an almost continuous helix , but with a distinct kink between the bun - dles . Several intrahelical main - chain H - bonds are lost between res - idues Glu - 2138 and Thr - 2143 , dividing the helix into two segments ( (cid:1) 5 and (cid:1) 6 ) , which are assigned to the N - and C - terminal bundles , respectively . The kink is , however , stabilized by several intra - and interhelical H - bonds that replace the lost main - chain H - bonds ( Fig . 2 B ) . Of particular note , three inter - actions with the beginning of helix (cid:1) 8 stabilize the kink : the amide side chain of Gln - 2198 makes simultane - ous H - bonds with the “orphan” amides of Gly - 2142 and Thr - 2143 , whereas the side chains of Thr - 2140 and Arg - 2144 act as C - terminal caps to helix (cid:1) 5 . In addition , the side chain of Glu - 2199 makes a salt bridge with Lys - 2141 , and the side chain of Ile - 2202 packs against Gly - 2142 . These features are conserved in all known sequences and are structurally conserved in all three copies of the two crystal forms , sug - gesting that the helical kink is a biological feature of the two - domain module . Other contacts between the bundles are lim - ited and vary in different crystal environments ( see below ) . The two molecules ( A and B ) in the Form 2 asymmetric unit have similar tertiary and quaternary organizations , but there are some significant differences . Thus , the individual bundles overlay with r . m . s . d . values of (cid:4) 0 . 5 Å for most main - chain res - idues . However , the large (cid:1) 1 – (cid:1) 2 loop in the first bundle adopts two distinct conformations , beginning at residue Asn - 2005 and propagating down helix (cid:1) 2 as far as Lys - 2024 . At the apex of the (cid:1) 1 – (cid:1) 2 turn , residue Ala - 2009 in molecule A shifts by 5 . 5 Å toward the second bundle compared with molecule B so that it makes hydrophobic contacts with the (cid:1) 9 – (cid:1) 10 loop from the second bundle ; there are also several water - mediated polar interaction ; nevertheless , the interface is limited . In molecule B , the only significant contacts between the two domains are two long range hydrogen bonds ( Arg - 2006 H - bonds to the C (cid:2) O of Gln - 2259 , and Lys - 2260 H - bonds to Gly - 2008 C (cid:2) O ) . The interfacial difference is linked to a significant alteration in the FIGURE 2 . Structure of IBS2 in the talin rod . A , schematic representation of the talin 1974 – 2293 crystal structure .

This is accommodated by a gradual bend in helix (cid:1) 5 with little change in the kink angle ( (cid:1) 40° ) . In Form 1 crystals ( see “Experimental Procedures” ) , the intrabundle con - tacts closely resemble those of Form 2 molecule A . Further - more , analysis of crystal contacts shows that this region in Form 2 Molecule B forms several lattice contacts , whereas molecule A does not . These observations point to a significant degree of flexibility within this interfacial region . Solution studies support the crystallographic studies , point - ing to an extended conformation with some flexibility , as judged by analytical gel filtration , SAXS , and NMR ( Fig . 3 ( A and B ) and supplemental Fig . S4 ) . Likewise , NMR line - widths point to a module of intermediate flexibility : the increase in line width of the IBS2 module compared with the individual bundles ( supplemental Fig . S4 , A – C ) is greater than that expected for a pair of domains tumbling independ - ently , but it is also greater than that expected for a rigid domain pair . Additionally , the positions of the resolved res - onances change very little compared with the two domains in isolation , consistent with the small interfacial area demon - strated crystallographically . The IBS2 module is relatively resistant to trypsin digestion , despite its high Arg and Lys content ( 11 % ) . The most abundant cleavage site is at Lys - 2133 between the two five - helix bundles , whereas Lys - 2141 and Arg - 2144 , which are also surface - ex - posed in the crystal structure , are resistant to cleavage . The crystal structure rationalizes these data : thus Lys - 2133 is fully exposed and makes only a weak ionic interaction with Asp - 2137 ( Fig . 2 B ) ; by contrast , Lys - 2141 is sandwiched between two glutamates , Glu - 2138 and Glu - 2139 , whereas Arg - 2144 forms multiple intramolecular interactions contributing to the (cid:1) 5 helix cap , as noted above .

Structure of the Talin Rod Second Integrin - binding Site MARCH 27 , 2009• VOLUME 284•NUMBER 13 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 8871 IBS2 Binds the (cid:2) 1 and (cid:2) 3 Integrin Cytoplasmic Domains —To confirm that the C - terminal region of the talin rod interacts with integrin cytoplasmic tails , we first performed pulldown experiments using biotinylated integrin tails immobilized on NeutrAvidin beads . IBS2 , as well as two longer constructs , 1974 – 2482 and 1974 – 2541 ( the latter includes the C - terminal dimerization domain ) , all bound strongly to integrin (cid:2) 3 , whereas the C - terminal domain alone ( residues 2300 – 2541 ) bound weakly ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . These data are consistent with the integrin - binding site being located within IBS2 . In contrast to previous reports , we found that individual IBS2A and IBS2B bundles bound integrin weakly or not at all . IBS2 also bound weakly to the (cid:1) IIb - integrin tail , although its significance is unclear . To further characterize these interactions , we used an ELISA - type assay in which biotinylated integrin tails were immobilized on NeutrAvidin - coated microtiter wells . Binding of V5 - tagged talin rod polypeptides was quantified using an anti - V5 monoclonal antibody . Talin head was used as a positive control , and uncoated NeutrAvidin - treated wells as negative controls . (cid:1) IIb - coated wells were also tested . Talin head ( resi - dues 1 – 405 ) bound in a dose - dependent manner to (cid:2) 3 - integrin tail ( Fig . 4 C ) with an EC 50 of 0 . 4 (cid:9) 0 . 2 (cid:6) M , consistent with published surface plasmon resonance studies ( 23 ) . The long construct , talin 1974 – 2541 , bound with lower affinity ( EC 50 (cid:10) 2 . 5 (cid:6) M ) , consistent with published data on the talin rod ( 23 ) . However , the IBS2 module alone bound with significantly higher affinity ( EC 50 0 . 9 (cid:9) 0 . 2 (cid:6) M ) , comparable to that of the head , sug - gesting that elements C - terminal to the IBS2 module may be autoinhibi - tory . A very similar EC 50 was found for binding of IBS2 to (cid:2) 1A - integrin ( 0 . 9 (cid:9) 0 . 1 (cid:6) M ) . The individual bun - dles of IBS2 did show dose - depend - ent integrin binding ( Fig . 4 D ) , but it was weak and not saturable under the conditions employed , with esti - mated EC 50 values of (cid:10) 2 . 5 (cid:6) M . These results confirm that strong integrin binding requires the intact IBS2 module . The IBS2 - A Five - helix Bundle Contains a Cryptic Vinculin Binding Site —IBS2 - A contains a potential vinculin - binding site in helix (cid:1) 4 ( talin rod helix 50 ) ( 3 ) , but , as with all such sites , the vinculin - binding residues are buried in the hydro - phobic core of the bundle . Very little binding between the IBS2 module and vinculin d1 domain ( Vd1 ) was observed at room temperature , but incubation at 37 °C led to substan - tial complex formation as detected by gel filtration ( Fig . 3 C ) . We have previously shown a similar temper - ature dependence for the vinculin - binding site in talin 482 – 655 ( 28 , 42 ) . IBS2 has a T m of 58 °C , and we conclude that increasing the temperature to the more physiologic 37 °C has a destabilizing effect on bundle integrity that facilitates vinculin binding . As expected , only the IBS2 - A bundle bound Vd1 ( Fig . 3 D and data not shown ) . IBS2 Localization to Focal Adhesions Does Not Require Vinculin —Talin fragments from the IBS2 region have been shown to localize to focal adhesions ( FAs ) ( 25 , 43 ) , but because IBS2A contains a vinculin - binding site ( 3 ) , it was unclear whether localization reflected binding to integrin or vinculin . To test this , we expressed GFP - tagged IBS2 in vinculin - null mouse embryo fibroblasts and found that it co - localized effi - ciently to FAs ( Fig . 5 ) . Thus , vinculin binding is not required for IBS2 localization to FAs . In contrast , GFP - IBS2 - A and GFP - IBS2 - B displayed only a diffuse cytoplasmic fluorescence . The data mirrors that on integrin binding and suggest that FA local - ization of IBS2 reflects its ability to bind integrins . Because activation of integrins by the talin FERM domain is dependent on interactions between basic residues on the mem - brane - proximal surface of the FERM domain and acidic phos - phoinositides in the plasma membrane ( 5 ) , we explored the binding of IBS2 to a range of phospholipids spotted on a nitrocellulose membrane . We found that IBS2 bound strongly to certain acidic lipids , including phosphatidylinosi - tol 3 , 5 - bisphosphate and phosphatidic acid ( Fig . 6 ) , and that , as in the case of integrin - binding and FA targeting , the two - do - main IBS2 module is required . Interestingly , binding to phos - FIGURE 4 . The talin 1974 – 2293 IBS2 polypeptide binds to (cid:1) 3 - integrin tails in pulldown and ELISA - type assays .

The talin IBS2 polypeptide , which contains both the IBS2 - A and IBS2 - B five - helix bundles , binds to (cid:2) 3 - integrin with much higher affinity than the individual IBS2 - A and IBS2 - B five - helix bundles .

Fine Mapping of the IBS2 - binding Determinants on Integrin — We first probed filters containing three overlapping SPOT - syn - thesized 25 - mer peptides spanning the cytoplasmic tails of (cid:2) 1A , (cid:2) 2 , (cid:2) 3 , and (cid:2) 7 integrins ( Fig . 7 , A and B ) with an IBS2 polypeptide spanning residues 1974 – 2541 . The data locate the major IBS2 - binding site within the 23 membrane - proximal res - idues of the (cid:2) - integrin tails ( Fig . 7 B ) and show that all the (cid:2) subunits tested bind equally well . We next carried out alanine point mutagenesis ( Fig . 7 C ) on this region . Replacement of most acidic residues led to a substantial increase in IBS2 bind - ing , whereas substitution of basic residues caused a small but consistent reduction , indicating an important role for charged residues in the interaction , and suggesting that the binding site on IBS2 is acidic . Effects of (cid:2) - Integrin Peptides on the Stability of the Talin IBS2 Module —To further characterize integrin binding to IBS2 , we used DSC to monitor the effect of integrin binding on the melt - ing temperature ( T m ) and unfolding enthalpy of IBS2 . Binding of the full - length (cid:2) 1A - integrin tail peptide ( 47 - mer ) to IBS2 ( Fig . 8 A and Table 2 ) led to a decrease in (cid:11) H at 100 (cid:6) M integrin . At 200 (cid:6) M integrin , (cid:11) H was reduced further , and there was also a large reduction in T m , suggestive of a conformational change and perhaps partial unfolding of IBS2 . Two peaks with different T m values are evident in the IBS2 module , and integrin binding promotes the peak with the lower melting temperature . The melting curves for IBS2 - A and IBS2 - B ( Fig . 8 , B and C ) show that the lower peak was entirely attributable to IBS2 - A . IBS2 - B did bind integrin , as judged by a significant reduction in T m and (cid:11) H , but still melted as a single peak . Binding of the shorter membrane - proximal peptide ( 25 - mer ) caused a similar decrease in (cid:11) H but did not lead to the formation of the peak at lower T m ( Fig . 8 , D – F ) suggesting that membrane - distal por - tions of the integrin contribute significantly to binding and con - formational change , especially in IBS2 - A . DISCUSSION We have determined the structure of talin residues 1974 – 2293 ( IBS2 ) , which consists of two five - helix bundles connected by a long helix with a pronounced kink or flexible region at its center . The topology of the two bundles is identical and so far unique to talin . The modest inter - bundle interface ( (cid:1) 600 Å 2 ) comprises mostly charged residues . Solution studies by SAXS and NMR are consistent with an extended conformation and with a relatively small interface with limited influence of one bundle on the other . Weak interactions between domains in the talin rod are not unexpected , because talin is thought to switch between a globular inactive and a more extended active confor - mation , which must involve changes in the interactions between at least some of the bundles . A relatively flexible inter - face and end - to - end packing between the helical bundles seems to be typical of the C - terminal region of the talin rod but con - FIGURE 5 .

Integrin binding to the IBS2 region has been reported previ - ously , and we have confirmed this by pulldown and ELISA assays . We also show for the first time that IBS2 binds to all (cid:2) - integrin tails with comparable affinity , and moreover an affinity that is only (cid:1) 2 - fold weaker than binding by the talin FERM domain . However , our studies contrast with earlier reports ( 24 , 25 , 44 ) by showing that tight binding to integrins requires both five - helix bundles .

Because the structures of the individual bundles appear not to be signifi - cantly influenced by the presence of the other bundle ( as judged by NMR ) , this suggests that both bundles directly contribute to integrin binding . We showed that this was indeed the case by using DSC , which clearly indicated binding of integrin tails to both bundles . We considered the possibility that integrin binds to residues at the interface between the two domains , but as these are not conserved this seems unlikely . Using blot overlays and DSC experiments , we mapped the major determinants of IBS2 binding to the membrane proximal ( (cid:1) 23 residue ) region of the (cid:2) - integrin tails , although more membrane - distal regions also contribute to strong binding . We further found that alanine substitution of acidic residues in (cid:2) - integrin tails consistently and uniquely increased IBS2 bind - ing , while substitution of basic residues had the opposite effect , suggesting that the interaction has a strong electrostatic com - ponent . Rodius et al . ( 44 ) has also presented evidence that elec - trostatic interactions are important in IBS2 binding to (cid:2) - inte - grin tails but concluded that two acidic residues in the (cid:2) 3 - integrin tail , Glu - 726 and Glu - 733 were involved in binding to Lys - 2085 and Lys - 2089 on the surface of talin helix 50 in IBS2 - A . It should be noted , however , that their experiments employed a fragment of talin ( 1843 – 2108 ) that includes part of IBS2 - A but lacks the last (cid:1) - helix . Our studies also differ in significant respects from those of Tremuth et al . ( 24 ) , who mapped the integrin - binding site to talin residues 1984 – 2113 . Our crystal structure shows that this fragment comprises part of IBS2 - A only and lacks part of the first helix and the whole of helix 5 , raising significant concerns over its structural integrity and utility in binding studies . How - ever , our DSC experiments show that integrin - binding destabi - lizes both IBS2 - A and IBS2 - B bundles , raising the possibility that the 1984 – 2113 construct favors integrin binding precisely , because the structure is destabilized . If so , this would be strongly reminiscent of our studies of vinculin binding , where the talin bundles must unfold to engage the vinculin head or F - actin , a process that is favored by truncated or mutant vari - ants of the talin bundle with altered stability ( 16 , 42 ) . Indeed , Moes et al . ( 25 ) showed that GST - (cid:2) 3 - integrin tails bound to an immobilized talin peptide corresponding to a single helix ( helix 50 , residues 2077 – 2099 ) in the talin IBS2 - A bundle . The signif - icance of these studies employing subdomain fragments re - mains to be determined . In an attempt to characterize the interaction between talin IBS2 and (cid:2) - integrin tails in more detail , we performed NMR experiments using unlabeled (cid:2) 3 - integrin peptides and 15 N - la - beled talin 1974 – 2293 ( in collaboration with S . Lorenz , N . Anthis , and I . D . Campbell ) . Unfortunately , the complex pre - cipitated ( both the integrin peptide and talin polypeptide could be detected in the precipitate by SDS - PAGE ) . Precipitation was seen with the high affinity fragments , full - length (cid:2) 3 - integrin tail ( residues 716 – 762 ) and the membrane proximal peptide ( residues 716 – 740 ) , but not with weakly binding membrane - distal peptides ( residues 736 – 749 and 744 – 762 ) . Precipitation at the high concentrations employed for NMR studies is con - FIGURE 8 . DSC analysis shows binding of various talin rod domains to (cid:1) - integrin tail peptides in solution .

In vivo , it is conceivable that conformational changes induced by integrin binding to IBS2 are stabilized by association with the plasma membrane , which is in close proximity , and our demonstration that IBS2 binds acidic phospholipids in vitro may be relevant here . Although speculative at this point , destabilization of the IBS2 bundle might also lead to exposure of the vinculin - binding site present in helix 50 ( or vice versa ) , resulting in vinculin binding and stabilization of the focal adhesion complex . Talin is thought to exist in an inactive form in which the integrin - binding sites are masked , and the recent studies of Goksoy et al . ( 45 ) have provided the first insights into the struc - tural basis for such autoinhibition . Thus , they have shown that the talin F3 FERM subdomain binds to residues 1654 – 2344 in the talin rod , and that this interaction masks the binding site for the membrane proximal helix of the (cid:2) - integrin cytoplasmic domain in F3 . The above region of the talin rod overlaps with IBS2 , and it will be interesting to see whether binding of F3 to the rod also masks IBS2 , i . e . the two integrin - binding sites may be co - regulated .
