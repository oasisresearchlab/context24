The study included 72 children with a median age of 11 years . The case group consisted of 37 children who had contracted COVID - 19 6 months prior to the analysis . They reported no other pre - or post - covid chronic or systemic diseases . The control group consisted of 35 children who had no prior record of COVID - 19 infection . The analysis showed a substantial variation ( P = 0 . 026 ) in the mean urea values ( mmol / L ) between the case group ( 4 . 513 ± 0 . 839 ) and the control group ( 5 . 425 ± 1 . 173 ) . However , both groups’ urea levels were within the normal range of their age group . No statistical differences were found analyzing the variations between the two groups in the levels of LDH , AST , ALT , BiliT , GGT , AlbBCG2 , CRP , CK , AlKP , UA , Phos , Crea2 , Gluc , Ca , Na , K , Cl , TP , TC , TG , and HDL ( P > 0 . 05 ) . The DMFT score was substantially greater ( P < 0 . 002 ) in the infected team ( 5 . 38 ± 2 . 841 ) in comparison to the non - infected group ( 2 . 6 ± 2 . 257 ) . The study indicates that COVID - 19 infection does not leave biochemical alterations among children who did not have pre - existing conditions . The biochemical analysis suggests that children recover better than adults from COVID - 19 . Furthermore , it calls for investigating non - lethal COVID - 19 infection as a tool to discover underlying conditions . The DMFT score shows a correlation between COVID - 19 infection and caries . However , the nature of the correlation is yet to be investigated . (cid:1) 2023 The Author ( s ) . Published by Elsevier B . V . on behalf of King Saud University .

Introduction The World Health Organization ( WHO ) announced that COVID - 19 was a pandemic in March 2020 ( Tizaoui et al . , 2020 ; Hu et al . , 2021 ) . Countries are still desperately seeking to deal with COVID - 19 and its long - term consequences with no approved therapeutic drugs ( Gameil et al . , 2021 ) . COVID - 19 can manifest itself in hosts through various symptoms including headaches , fever , dry cough , breathing difﬁculty , and pneumonia , which can potentially pro - gress to respiratory failure and death ( Zhou et al . , 2020 ) . The con - ﬁrmation of the virus protein has been changed , causing different variants to adjust to drugs or the human enzyme angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ( Abdalla et al . , 2022 ) . Toward the middle and end of 2022 , a nationwide vaccine movement along with non - pharmaceutical precautions helped restore some normality to peo - ple’s lives ( Li and Giabbanelli , 2021 ) . Ongoing research is examining possible therapies for COVID - 19 ( Eltayb et al . , 2023 ; Abdalla and Rabie , 2023 ) , as well as the various ways in which COVID - 19 has affected different aspects of health . The effect of COVID - 19 on children has not been as thoroughly studied as its effect on adults ( Hu et al . , 2021 ; Pierce et al . , 2022 ) . It had been previously thought that children infected with COVID - 19 were asymptomatic or that they only developed mild symptoms https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . sjbs . 2023 . 103649 1319 - 562X / (cid:1) 2023 The Author ( s ) .

However , recent reports have shown that a signiﬁcant proportion of youth were affected by the infection , and some even developed serious COVID - 19 com - plications ( Pierce et al . , 2022 ) . Several children developed post COVID - 19 multisystem hyperinﬂammatory syndrome ( Suratannon et al . , 2020 ; Biglari et al . , 2021 ; Bi et al . , 2020 ) . Despite this , there is currently a lack of research on the biochemical param - eters in children post COVID - 19 recovery . Thus , the objective of this study is to investigate the long - term impact of COVID - 19 on the biochemical parameters of liver and kidney and other systems in recovered children living in Saudi Arabia . Besides fever and dry cough , COVID - 19 may lead to persistent and chronic difﬁculty in breathing , tiredness , chest discomfort and brain fog in children ( Long COVID or Post - COVID Conditions , CDC , 2022 ) . Great scientiﬁc attention was given to the impact of COVID - 19 on biochemical serum parameters to evaluate the func - tions of organs that were reported to be affected by COVID - 19 ( Pourbagheri - Sigaroodi et al . , 2020 ) , like the heart , liver , and kid - ney ( Wang et al . , 2020 ) . Certain diagnostic laboratory tests are used to monitor the severity of COVID - 19 and the associated risks ( Goudouris , 2021 ) , including C - reactive protein ( CRP ) , lactic dehy - drogenase ( LDH ) , creatine kinase ( CK ) , urea , and creatinine , where higher levels were observed in patients with severe cases of COVID - 19 ( Vabret et al . , 2020 ; Chen et al . , 2020 ; Goudouris , 2021 ) . Kocˇar thoroughly discussed the role of different forms of choles - terol and lipoproteins in the life cycle of COVID - 19 ( Kocˇar et al . , 2021 ) . The cholesterol component of the host cell membrane appears to contribute to the process in the endocytosis of the virus ( Kocˇar et al . , 2021 ) . Additionally , high density lipoproteins ( HDL ) seem to act as a virus scavenger , immunomodulator , and viral entry mediator ( Kocˇar et al . , 2021 ; Kluck et al . , 2021 ) . The lipid pro - ﬁle of recovered adult patients showed decreased levels of total cholesterol and HDL which suggested a potential role of lipid pro - ﬁle in monitoring the status of the viral infection ( Kocˇar et al . , 2021 ) . Severely ill patients showed reduced triglyceride ( TG ) and total protein levels ( TP ) ( Huang et al . , 2020 ) . Total protein ( TP ) levels remained low in adults up to 20 days post infection , which then rapidly recovered ( Wang et al . , 2021a , 2021b ) . Studies in adults have shown that intense COVID - 19 symptoms are associated with signiﬁcantly elevated blood glucose levels ( Chen et al . , 2020 ) . A cross - sectional study reported a statistically signiﬁcant correlation between COVID - 19 and electrolyte imbal - ance . Those who tested positive for COVID - 19 showed lower levels of potassium ( K ) , calcium ( Ca ) , and chloride ( Cl ) and a higher sodium ( Na ) concentration ( Pani et al . , 2021 ) . Most published lab - oratory data was in diagnostic context and taken from adults . However , there is currently a lack of publicly available information on children’s blood electrolytes , lipid proﬁle , glucose , and total protein levels post COVID - 19 recovery . However , a less examined , but very important , area of research is the long - term post - COVID - 19 residue to understand how long it takes to reach full recovery if such recovery is possible . A study of 120 adult survivors of COVID - 19 showed elevated immune cell counts , haemoglobin values , and levels of ALT , AST , GGT ALP , serum lipase , serum amylase , BUN , serum creatinine , and urine ACR , hyperuricemia , triacylglycerols and LDL - cholesterol , and serum albumin when compared with a control group ( Gameil et al . , 2021 ) . Further research on the long - term consequences of COVID - 19 is necessary . Oral health has a signiﬁcant impact on overall health . The quar - antine measures implemented due to the spread of COVID - 19 have been associated with a notable rise in caries and DMFT ( decayed , missing , and ﬁlled primary teeth ) scores , indicating a noteworthy deterioration in children’s dental health ( Helal et al . , 2022 ) . Simi - larly , studies of other types of viral infections showed an increased DMFT score in infected adults and children ( Coates et al . , 2000 ; Oliveira et al . , 2015 ) . However , no studies were found to measure the difference in DMFT scores in infected children versus non - infected children . The objective of this research is to examine the enduring impact of COVID - 19 on the general serum biochemistry as it is related to overall well - being of children who recovered from this viral infection . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 Ethical approval The Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) for the Clinical Research Committee of King Abdullah International Medical Research Center ( KMARC ) , Jeddah , Saudi Arabia ( IRB / 0247 / 23 ) provided ethical approval . All procedures were conducted in compliance with the ethical standards set by the institutional research committee . Additionally , written consent was obtained from all participants’ parents to ensure their participation in the study . 2 . 2 . Study Subjects , clinical evaluation , and questionnaire The participants were children between the ages of 7 – 13 living in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia . Seventy - two children were recruited and split into 2 cohorts . The case group was the ﬁrst group , it com - prised of 37 children who had been infected with COVID - 19 . Their parents reported that they were diagnosed with COVID - 19 using RT - PCR test . The children had recovered at least 6 months before sample col - lection and were free from any other chronic diseases . The control group included 35 healthy children with no history of COVID - 19 based on their parents’ explanation of their health conditions . In order to record the DMFT score , all participants underwent an oral check - up . Individuals with orthodontic appliances , remov - able / ﬁxed prosthesis , or any of the following conditions : mouth diseases , abscess , draining sinus , cellulitis , or other conditions that required immediate dental treatment , were excluded from the study . A questionnaire was administered to all participants to gather information on their medical history , age , and gender . The questionnaire was divided into the following different sections , following the questionnaire model of Bhattarai et al . ( 2018 ) : socio - demographic , medical history of participants and family , tobacco exposure , oral hygiene , family history and other relevant information ( Bhattarai et al . , 2018 ) . To assess anxiety and stress , participants were asked to rank their evaluation of the stress level they feel at the time of data collection on a scale from 0 to 10 , where zero indicated not stressed at all and ten being the highest stress level . 2 . 3 . Exclusion criteria To rule out any potential effect of other medical conditions this study excluded any participant with : (cid:1) Systemic or local diseases . (cid:1) The record of using antibiotics in the immediate or near past , typically within the last month . (cid:1) Youth experiencing serious illnesses and / or had trouble open - ing their oral cavity . (cid:1) Ailments such as draining sinus , abscess , cellulitis , or other urgent dental problems that necessitate immediate treatment . (cid:1) Children wearing any dental braces or any permanent or tem - porary prosthodontic restoration . A . Abdulaziz Alsufyani Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences 30 ( 2023 ) 103649 2 (cid:1) Kids who have habitual oral behaviors , including breathing through the mouth . (cid:1) Children with early childhood caries . 2 . 4 . Serum biochemistry Eight - hour fasting venous blood samples were collected from participants after signing the consent form for blood withdrawal . The samples were centrifuged at a speed of 6000 rpm for 7 min . and the serum that was obtained was stored at (cid:3) 4 (cid:3) C for < 12 h before the serum was used to analyze serum biochemical proﬁle and renal , liver , and bile duct functions blood tests . The following analytes were measured in the blood samples : total protein ( TP ) , glucose ( Gluc ) , total cholesterol ( TC ) , triglyceride ( TG ) , high - density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , urea , creatinine , uric acid , phosphorus , total bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , gamma - glutamyltransferase ( GGT ) , albumin ( AlbBCG2 ) , C - reactive protein ( CRP ) , creatine , kinase ( CK ) , alkaline phosphatase ( AlkP ) , calcium ( Ca ) , sodium ( Na ) , potassium ( K ) , and chlorine ( Cl ) . The blood samples were analyzed using standard procedures of the Architect c8000 , which is an automated clinical chemistry ana - lyzer ( Abbott , Abbott Park , IL , USA ) at the clinical biochemistry lab - oratory of King Abdulaziz Medical City , King Khalid Hospital for National Guard , Jeddah , Saudi Arabia , an afﬁliate of King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences ( KSAU - HS ) . 2 . 5 . Statistical analysis First , the ordinal and nominal variables were coded . Continuous variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation , while cate - gorical variables are expressed as percentages . The normal distri - bution of the variable was assessed using the Shapiro - Wilk test . The Mann - Whitney U Test was employed for non - normal vari - ables , and independent samples T - Test for normal variables , with P values < 0 . 05 indicating statistical signiﬁcance . The statistical analysis was conducted using RStudio v 4 . 2 . 1 and SPSS v 25 . 3 . Results Biochemical parameters were collected from 37 COVID - 19 infected and recovered children with a mean age of 11 ( ±1 . 202 ) years old . They were compared to parameters collected from 35 children with a mean age of 10 . 86 ( ±1 . 089 ) years old who were not infected , to measure the traces of COVID - 19 in recovered chil - dren’s kidney and liver function lab tests 6 months after the onset of the infection . 3 . 1 . General biochemical parameters The Shapiro - Wilk test of normality presented that the popula - tions are typically distributed for Ca , Na , K , Cl , Gluc , TC , TG , and HDL values . Thus , a T - Test was employed using independent sam - ples to investigate whether the infected group and the non - infected group were statistically different . The Mann - Whitney U Test was utilized for TP as its values were not normally distributed . The differences between the means of the biochemical parame - ters in infected children 6 months following the start of COVID - 19 were not notably varied ( P > 0 . 05 ) from the mean of the children who had not been infected at all ( Table 1 ) . 3 . 2 . Kidney and liver function tests As summarized in Table 2 , the mean difference of LDH , AST , BiliT , ALT , GGT , AlbBCG2 , CRP , CK , AlKP , UA , Phos , and Crea2 fell short of any statistical signiﬁcance when comparing the two groups since the P values were > 0 . 05 . The mean for urea in the infected group 4 . 513 ( ±0 . 839 ) surpassed the mean in the nonin - fected group 5 . 425 ( ±1 . 173 ) , and this disparity was far more impor - tant ( P = 0 . 026 ) . However , both means were within the normal range of urea values among youth aged 1 – 16 years old , which lies between 2 . 5 and 6 . 5 mmol / l ( Beresford , 2022 ) . 3 . 3 . Descriptive statistics and DMFT score As seen in Table 3 , the affected children have a notably higher mean DMFT score compared to healthy children ( P = 0 . 002 ) . Fig . 1 exhibits a comparison of the frequencies of DMFT scores from each population ( infected and non - infected children ) . Pink bars represent the non – infected children , whereas the grey bars Table 1 Comparison between means of biochemical parameters of infected and non - infected children with P values .

Abdulaziz Alsufyani Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences 30 ( 2023 ) 103649 3 represent infected children . Bars were superimposed on each other for easier visualization and comparison . Most non - infected chil - dren have a DMFT score of 0 , followed by DMFT scores between 2 and 4 , and only a few with DMFT scores between 4 and 7 . Pink bars represent samples from the population of infected children . As seen from the bar height , most infected children have DMFT scores between 4 and 6 and some children have DMFT scores above 8 . The histogram of the non - infected children is right - skewed indi - cating a higher population with low DMFT scores . On the other hand , the histogram of infected children is more spread out , reﬂecting higher DMFT scores in infected children . 4 . Discussion This research aimed to assess the condition of children’s health after recovery from COVID - 19 through an assessment of serum biochemical parameters and general health . Collecting data from children who tested positive for COVID - 19 after 6 months of recov - ery was challenging for this age group , and that contributed to the sample size . Another limitation was ﬁnding retrospective data for the recovered children from the time of infection for comparison . Despite these limitations , the results of this study provide signiﬁ - cant insights into the impact of COVID - 19 on the biochemical parameters and well - being of long - term recovered children in Saudi Arabia . COVID - 19 inﬂuences the serum biochemistry of patients . Thus , it is important to determine whether blood biochemical markers will recover , and if so , when would this recovery be fully achieved . There is no notable statistical difference between the group of infected children and the control group with regards to glucose , cholesterol , TG , HDL , TP , Na , Ca , K , and Cl levels after 6 months of diagnosis with COVID - 19 . All tested values were within normal ranges for the selected age group . When assessing children’s overall health , the mean DMFT scores were higher in the infected group in comparison to the mean DMFT scores among children who were not infected . This highly signiﬁcant ( P = 0 . 002 ) difference suggests a potential corre - lation between COVID - 19 infection and DMFT scores . This result is in agreement with published correlations between viral infections and DMFT scores ( Oliveira et al . , 2015 ; Coates et al . , 2000 ; Zhu et al . , 2020 ) . There is no other published data available that demonstrates the correlation between DMFT scores and COVID - 19 . A potential interpretation could be a link between the overall hygiene and oral care habits of the child as a common factor between contracting the infection and developing caries . On the other hand , when dental caries progress , this leads to a systemic immune response ( Zhu et al . , 2020 ) . However , the investigation of this is beyond the scope of this paper , and it poses some ques - tions to be further investigated . A few questions to be asked include : is the acidity of the mouth associated with caries linked with the potential of a viral infection ? Does caries suggest imbal - anced mouth immunity and thus a greater tendency to contract an infection ? Several studies have shown the manifestation of COVID - 19 in the liver ( Garrido et al . , 2020 ; Cooper et al . , 2022 ) and kidneys ( Kari et al . , 2021 ; Raina et al . , 2021 ; Wang et al . , 2021a , 2021b ) in children . This study evaluates liver and kidney function bio - chemical parameters in children who recovered from COVID - 19 6 months after recovery . There has been no research conducted on the long - term biochemical residues after COVID - 19 recovery in children between the ages of 7 – 13 , without any other symptoms . In 2020 , Garrido et al . reviewed the effects of COVID - 19 on liver function in children . Researchers concluded that the presence of abnormal liver function tests in children should draw attention to underlying liver disease because COVID - 19 does not alter liver enzymes in children ( Garrido et al . , 2020 ) . These results are corrob - orated by data reported by Cooper et al , on 5 children between the ages of 2 to 13 years who recovered from COVID - 19 and then developed liver damage . Thus , developing liver disease was an inclusion criterion for their study ( Cooper et al . , 2022 ) . The aim of the study was to examine traces of COVID - 19 in children who recovered with no other long - term symptoms , 6 months or more after contracting COVID - 19 . Current research has shown that there were no notable differ - ences in the liver and kidney functions between the two groups , except for urea levels . The average levels of urea in both groups were within the normal range . Interestingly , serum urea means revealed a substantial reduction in the COVID - 19 recovered group ( P = 0 . 026 ) when compared to the control group . As the means fall within the normal range , any variations observed in the means are usually attributed to individual differences within groups of indi - viduals . Urea concentration differences could be attributed to sev - eral reasons , including protein intake or other factors . The data collected from COVID - 19 recovering children contra - dicts the ﬁndings from studies conducted on adult survivors of COVID - 19 , who were also free from any other health conditions ( Gameil et al . , 2021 ) . According to Gameil et al , adult COVID - 19 survivors exhibited a notable decrease in serum albumin and a sig - niﬁcant boost in the levels of ALT , AST , GGT , and ALP 3 months after their infection ( Gameil et al . , 2021 ) . The current study on chil - dren COVID - 19 survivors did not show a difference in albumin , ALT , AST , GGT , and ALP levels after recovery . Fig . 1 . Bar graph comparing DMFT scores in infected and non - infected children . A . Abdulaziz Alsufyani Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences 30 ( 2023 ) 103649 4 The study results showed no alteration of the inﬂammatory protein CRP in children who had regained full health after COVID - 19 , which is contrary to studies on adults that found a per - sistent increase in CRP levels after COVID - 19 infection ( Mandal et al . , 2021 ) . Conversely , research on adults did show signiﬁcant differences in inﬂammatory protein CRP levels in adults infected and recovered from COVID - 19 compared to noninfected individu - als ( Gameil et al . , 2021 ) . The research ﬁndings can also be exam - ined alongside the observations made by Chen et al , that compared CRP levels between adults and children and found that children had lower levels of CRP than adults , after both adults and children in the study recovered from COVID - 19 . ( Chen et al . , 2020 ) . These ﬁndings imply that children might experience less severe symptoms of COVID - 19 than adults as a result of their lower values of inﬂammatory markers even when infected . An overall evaluation of the ﬁndings shows that all serum means for LDH , AST , ALT , BiliT , GGT , AlbBCG2 , CRP , CK , AlKP , UA , Phos , Urea , and Crea2 are within the normal range in children 6 months after recovery from COVID - 19 who have no other health complications . There are no signiﬁcant differences between the means of these parameters in the case and control groups . Demon - strating that there are no indications of impairment on kidney and liver function biomarkers in healthy children with no pre - existing medical conditions is a signiﬁcant outcome of the study . It indi - cates that such children can handle a COVID - 19 infection well , with no lasting effects . It also opens up another perspective for looking at the COVID - 19 infection as a detector of undiscovered , underly - ing health conditions for further attention . These results are lim - ited to the sample of COVID - 19 diagnosed children which were able to be recruited . A large - scale multicenter and retrospective study can be useful in supporting or contradicting these ﬁndings for a better understanding of the effect of the virus on children . When this paper was written , there was a lack of available data regarding the biochemical parameters of children who had recov - ered from COVID - 19 symptoms as compared to healthy , non - infected children . Consiglio et al ( 2020 ) , showed a comparison between serum parameters of youth who had contracted COVID - 19 and those who suffered from multisystem inﬂammatory syn - drome ( MIS ) . MIS is a potentially uncommon side effect of COVID - 19 in children . The mean Na levels ( mmol / L ) in youth who had contracted COVID - 19 and MIS were reported to be 139 and 133 . 5 respectively ( Consiglio et al . , 2020 ) . This shows that MIS complications lead to hyponatremia , which is when Na levels fall below normal ranges of 135 – 145 mmol per liter . Both values were lower than the mean values of infected children 6 months after recovery . The mean reported Na levels were 139 . 2 for chil - dren recovering from COVID - 19 , and 138 . 92 for the control group of non - infected children . The results suggest that a 6 - month recov - ery period is sufﬁcient for the return to normal Na levels amongst youth who contracted COVID - 19 . These results are important to show that if the child recovers from COVID - 19 with no obvious symptoms , he / she is more likely to retain normal blood glucose , lipid proﬁle , and electrolytes levels 6 months after infection . These results support the notion that children are more resilient than adults in responding to the infection . 5 . Conclusion In conclusion , from a serum biochemical analysis perspective , this study shows that male children aged 7 to 13 years living in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia fully recovered from COVID - 19 6 months after contracting the infection . The study supports the claim that COVID - 19 infection does not leave biochemical traces in the biochemical proﬁles of infected children who are free of any other underlying health conditions . This study supports the view that children can recover better than adults . It also sheds light on an important unanswered question about the correlation between DMFT scores and COVID - 19 infec - tion . Furthermore , the study supports the hypothesis of looking at non - lethal COVID - 19 infections as a potential to discover under - lying conditions . Funding This study did not receive any grant from funding agencies in the public , commercial , or non - proﬁt sectors .
