In this study , the level of SARS - CoV - 2 in air and on surfaces of SARS - CoV - 2 infected nursing home residents was assessed to gain insight in potential transmission routes . During outbreaks , air samples were collected using three different active and one passive air sampling technique in rooms of infected patients . Oropharyngeal swabs ( OPS ) of the residents and dry surface swabs were collected . Additionally , longitudinal passive air samples were collected during a period of 4 months in common areas of the wards . Presence of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was determined using RT - qPCR , targeting the RdRp - and E - genes . OPS , samples of two active air samplers and surface swabs with Ct value ≤35 were tested for the presence of infectious virus by cell culture . In total , 360 air and 319 surface samples from patient rooms and common areas were collected . In rooms of 10 residents with detected SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in OPS , SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was detected in 93 of 184 collected environmental samples ( 50 . 5 % ) ( lowest Ct 29 , 5 ) , substantially more than in the rooms of residents with negative OPS on the day of environmental sampling ( n = 2 ) ( 3 . 6 % ) . SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was most frequently present in the larger particle size fractions ( > 4 μm 60 % ( 6 / 10 ) ; 1 - 4 μm 50 % ( 5 / 10 ) ; < 1 μm 20 % ( 2 / 10 ) ) ( Fischer exact test p = 0 . 076 ) . The highest proportion of RNA - positive air samples on room level was found with a filtration - based sampler 80 % ( 8 / 10 ) and the cyclone - based sampler 70 % ( 7 / 10 ) , and impingement - based sampler 50 % ( 5 / 10 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was detected in ten out of twelve ( 83 % ) passive air samples in patient rooms . Both high - touch and low - touch surfaces contained SARS - CoV - 2 genome in rooms of residents with positive OPS ( high 38 % ( 21 / 55 ) ; low 50 % ( 22 / 44 ) ) . In one active air sample , infectious virus in vitro was detected . In conclusion , SARS - CoV - 2 is frequently detected in air and on surfaces in the immediate surroundings of room - isolated COVID - 19 patients , providing evidence of environmental contamination . The environmental contamination of SARS - CoV - 2 and infectious aerosols confirm the potential for transmission via air up to several meters .

There is consensus on the role of direct contact transmission and airborne transmission at short distances ( up to several meters ) through large droplets . There is an ongoing debate on transmission through fomites and airborne transmission at larger distances ( up to more than several meters ) as a risk factor for subsequent infection 1 , 2 . The relative importance of this mode of transmission as driver of the pandemic is unknown . Several modes of transmission through the environment as a possible risk of infection of SARS - CoV - 2 is considered important for groups at high risk 3 . Previous studies investigating SARS - CoV - 2 air concentrations in healthcare facilities showed contradictory results . In a limited number of studies in hospital settings , SARS - CoV - 2 has been detected in air in proximity ( 2 - 5m ) of COVID - 19 patients 1 , 4 – 8 . Other studies did not find evidence of SARS - CoV - 2 in air 9 – 12 . However , the comparability of studies is limited due to differences in sampling methods , sampling duration and distance to infected persons . Oropharyngeal swabs were not consistently collected from infected persons for confirmation of infection and the actual level SARS - CoV - 2 shedding in addition to the collection of air samples . Infectiousness of SARS - CoV - 2 detected in air was not investigated in most studies 4 – 7 or could not be shown 13 , 14 . Infectivity and amount of shed virus have been reported to rapidly decline during the first week after illness onset 15 , 16 . As viral RNA can persist and be shed for prolonged periods of time without being infectious , it is important to investigate the viability of virus in air to understand airborne transmission routes of the virus . Therefore , to successfully investigate modes of transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 , it seems crucial to investigate SARS - CoV - 2 air concentrations in the first days following infection . After the first pandemic wave in the Netherlands , nursing homes had introduced enhanced surveillance screening for SARS - CoV - 2 , which led to identification of new infections at an early stage 17 . To determine airborne transmission risks from SARS - CoV - 2 infected patients to their immediate surroundings , we measured SARS - CoV - 2 in air and on surfaces in Dutch nursing home residencies as well as in rooms of SARS - CoV - 2 isolated infected nursing home residents . Methods and materials The study consisted of two arms : a series of environmental investigations during outbreaks and longitudinal air monitoring ( Figure 1 ) . Weekly SARS - CoV - 2 infections were registered and notified in 28 nursing homes from Mijzo Care organisation in Noord - Brabant in the Netherlands . In case of two All rights reserved .

In a subsample of 3 of the 28 nursing homes , longitudinal monitoring took place in the direct living environment . No medical ethical approval was needed for this study as evaluated by the Medical Research Ethics Committee of University Medical Centre Utrecht ; a declaration of non - compliance with the scope of the Dutch Medical Research Involving Human Subject Act was obtained . The study was conducted in agreement with the European legislation on handling privacy - sensitive data . Outbreak investigation Residents of the nursing homes were tested for possible SARS - CoV - 2 infection in case they experienced COVID - 19 related symptoms . When one or more residents in a ward tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 infection , all other ward residents were screened for SARS - CoV - 2 infection during surveillance rounds . Residents who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA were eligible for inclusion in the outbreak investigation within 8 days since the onset of symptoms or within 8 days since the first positive surveillance test result . Only patients in isolation from somatic wards were included . Oral informed consent was obtained from patients and / or from an authorised legal representative or family member . Collection of air samples Air samples were collected at three locations in the patient’s room : 1 ) near the head of the patients within approximately 0 . 5 meter of the patient , 2 ) near the feet of bedridden patients approximately 1 . 5 meters from the head or approximately 1 . 5 meters from mobile patients sitting in a chair , and 3 ) near the location often used by healthcare workers more than 2 meters away from the patient such as the sink , all positioned at 1 . 5m height . In every patient room , 6 - hr inhalable dust samples were taken using a filtration - based technique at all three locations ( Conical Inhalable dust Sampler ( CIS ) , JS Holdings , UK ) . In addition , one 6 - hr two - stage cyclone - based sample with filter back - up was positioned near the feet of the patient when bedridden or at 1 . 5 meters from the chair of the patient ( NIOSH BC 251 , kindly provided by Dr William G Lindsley , NIOSH CDC , Morgantown , USA ) , as well as a 1 - hr impingement - based sampler positioned in proximity of the head of the patient ( 5ml BioSampler , SKC , UK ) ( See supplement Figure S1 ) . During the 6 - hour sample collection , mobile patients were allowed to move in the room . During the 1 - hour impingement - based sample collection , they were asked to stay seated in their chair . The filtration - based sampler was equipped with a 37mm diameter 2 . 0μm pore - size Teflon filter ( Pall incorporated , Ann Arbor , USA ) . The two - All rights reserved .

The 15 ml and 1 . 5 ml conical tubes were filled with virus transport medium 1 ( VTM - 1 ; Erasmus Medical Center ( EMC ) , Rotterdam , The Netherlands ) during sampling and Opti - MeM TM ( Gibco , UK ) was added immediately after collection ( see supplementary methods for more details and composition of media ) . Adding VTM - 1 is a modification of the standard operating procedure for this sampler with the aim to enhance culturability of the virus . The impingement - based sampler contained VTM - 1 during sampling , and after completion of sampling , Opti - MeM TM was added as well . Airborne settling dust was sampled using Electrostatic Dust Collectors ( EDCs ) 18 , which were placed in each included patient room and the corresponding hallway , common living room , and nurse office of the ward . EDCs were placed in holders pinned to the ceiling in the middle of the space , approximately 30cm underneath the ceiling or on top of a cabinet . EDCs were collected after 2 - 4 weeks of sampling , dependent on the timing of extensive cleaning of the room . Collection of surface samples High - and low - touch surface samples were collected using dry surface swabs ( Medical Wire Dry Swabs , MW730 , Corsham , UK ) as described previously 19 , 20 . A total of ten samples were taken in each patient room , and in the corresponding hallway , common living room , and nurse office of the ward . Disposable plastic grids of 10 cm 2 were used to standardise collection of surface swabs . Swabs were placed in viral transport medium 2 ( VTM - 2 ; Erasmus Medical Center ( EMC ) , Rotterdam , The Netherlands ) directly after collection ( see supplementary methods for the composition of media ) . Field blank samples were collected every other outbreak sampling day for each air sampling technique and every outbreak sampling day for surface swab sampling . See supplementary methods for details on sample collection and laboratory methods . Patient characteristics Patient characteristics were obtained : gender , year of birth , date of symptom onset , symptoms , date of SARS - CoV - 2 test , SARS - CoV - 2 test results , COVID - 19 treatment such as oxygen therapy and mobility . An affirmative oropharyngeal swab ( OPS ) ( Medical Wire Dry Swabs , 111598 , Milano , Italy ) was collected during the outbreak investigation and stored in a tube containing VTM - 2 .

In each selected nursing home , settling dust samples were collected repeatedly in three to four wards from December 2020 until May 2021 . Per ward , 6 EDCs were placed in hallways , living rooms and nurse offices and renewed every four weeks for a period of four months . Incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 infections in patients and staff members at the included wards was obtained in weekly reports . Laboratory analysis All samples , except settling dust samples , were stored and send to the laboratory refrigerated at 4 °C directly after collection . At the laboratory , samples were stored at 4°C until further processing within 24 - hours under biosafety laboratory ( BSL ) - 2 + conditions 21 . Filters were removed from the filter holder and transferred to a tube containing VTM - 1 . These and all other outbreak investigation samples were subsequently vortexed . Settling dust samples were transferred to tubes containing VTM - 2 and tamped down , vortexed and soaked repeatedly for several minutes . For RT - qPCR analysis , an aliquot of VTM was mixed in a 1 : 1 dilution with MagNA Pure 96 External Lysis Buffer for each sample ( Roche Diagnostics , Almere the Netherlands ) . Remaining VTM from cyclone - based samples , impingement - based samples , surface swabs and OPS were stored for culturing . All samples were stored frozen at - 80 ℃ until further processing . More details are described in the supplementary methods . Real time semi - quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction VTM - lysis buffer samples were tested for presence of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA using a SARS - CoV - 2 RNA RT - qPCR , targeting the E gene and CoV - 2 RdRp - gene of SARS - CoV - 2 using the cobas® 6800 / 8800 Systems ( Roche Diagnostics ) 22 . If both E - gene and RdRp - gene were detected with Cobas RT - qPCR , samples were classified as positive . In case of a discrepant result , i . e . only one of the two genes was detected , an in - house RT - qPCR assay was conducted for confirmation 23 . In case of detection of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA , the sample was classified as positive and in case of inconclusive or non - detection with in - house RT - qPCR , the final result was classified as inconclusive . Samples with non - detection of both genes were classified as negative . Virus culture All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

Virus culture was performed in 24 - wells plates seeded with Vero cells , clone 118 . Samples were added to the wells , centrifuged , and inoculum was discarded . Virus culture medium was added , and samples were cultured at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 for seven days . If a virus - induced cytopathic effect ( CPE ) was observed , immunofluorescent detection of SARS - CoV - 2 nucleocapsid protein was performed to confirm the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 . Data analysis Data entry was carried out in Microsoft Access Version 16 2012 . Descriptive statistics were obtained by R studio Version 1 . 4 . 1106 2021 . Active air sample techniques were compared on room level . If one or more of the filtration - based samples in a room were positive , the outcome on room level was classified as positive . The same applied for the CDC - NIOSH cyclone - based samples on room level . Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the proportion of positive samples in association with particle size fractions , distance and location , and to compare air sampling techniques . Agreement between outcomes of filtration - based and cyclone - based samples collected at the same location was investigated through Cohen’s Kappa test statistics . A threshold of 0 . 05 was used for the p - value for statistical significance . Results A total of 679 environmental samples were collected from five nursing home wards , including 101 air samples and 122 surface samples from the patient rooms and 259 air samples and 197 surface samples from common areas . In total , 13 patients were included for environmental sample collection during outbreak investigations . One patient withdrew from the study during sampling . Of the remaining 12 patients , two tested negative , and 10 tested positive in affirmative OPS collected on the day of environmental sample collection ( Table 1 ) . From one patient with negative OPS , only surface swabs were collected . For air samples , RdRp Ct - values ranged from 29 . 5 to 37 . 2 and from 30 . 2 to 37 . 8 in surface swab and from 19 . 8 to 34 . 7 in OPS . All field and laboratory blanks tested negative for viral SARS - CoV - 2 RNA . SARS - CoV - 2 contamination in air Of the 184 environmental samples collected in rooms of patients with positive OPS on the day of sampling , 50 . 5 % were positive ( 93 / 184 ) . From the two patients with negative OPS , only one of the samples tested positive ( 1 / 29 ) , which appeared a surface swab ( Table 1 ) . All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

The highest proportion of positive active air samples was found with the filtration - based sampler 80 % ( 8 / 10 ) and CDC - NIOSH cyclone - based sampler ( 70 % ( 7 / 10 ) . The impingement - based sampler ( 50 % ( 5 / 10 ) ) showed a slightly lower proportion of positive samples , but the results were not statistically significant ( Fisher - exact test p - value = 0 . 69 ) . The cyclone - based samples sampled approximately 1 . 26 m 3 of air , the filtration - based samples 1 . 26 m 3 and the impingement - based 0 . 75 m 3 . Ten of the collected 12 settling dust samples from rooms were positive ( 83 % ) . Filtration - based samples and cyclone - based samples collected side - by - side at the same distance from the patient were concordant in 8 out of 10 cases ( moderate agreement ( Cohen’s kappa coefficient kappa = 0 . 5 , p - value = 0 . 197 ) ) ( Supplement Table S4 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 was detected at all distances from the patient . No clear trend was seen in numbers of positive samples with distance from the patient in filtration - based air samples ( > 1 . 5m 50 % ( 6 / 12 ) ; ≤1 . 5m 67 % ( 10 / 15 ) ) ( Fisher - exact test , p - value = 0 . 4175 ) ( Supplement Table S3 ) . In all particle size - specific fractions ( > 4 μm 60 % ( 6 / 10 ) ; 1 - 4 μm 50 % ( 5 / 10 ) ; < 1 μm 20 % ( 2 / 10 ) SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was detected ( Table 2 ) . However , inconclusive and positive results were more frequently present in the largest particle size fraction , followed by the intermediate size fraction . These differences in distribution of size categories was borderline statistically significant ( Fischer exact test p - value = 0 . 076 ) . High - and low - touch surface swabs The proportion of positive surface samples was much higher in rooms from patients with positive OPS compared to rooms with negative patients ( 43 % ( 43 / 99 ) versus 0 , 5 % ( 1 / 20 ) ) ( see Supplement Table S5 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was detected slightly more frequently in surface swabs from low - touch surfaces than from high - touch surfaces ( low 50 % ( 22 / 44 ) ; high 38 % ( 21 / 55 ) ) ( Fisher’s exact test p - value = 0 . 18 ) . Only 5 of the 197 surface samples collected in common areas were positive for SARS - CoV - 2 ; four low and one high - touch sample ( Supplement Table S6 ) . Virus culture Among the 78 positive OPS , cyclone - based samples , impingement - based samples , surface swab samples , 44 had a RdRp Ct - value ≤35 and were further investigated by in vitro virus culture . This selection contained four impingement - based samples , three cyclone - based samples fraction size > 4 μm , three cyclone - based samples fraction size 1 - 4 μm , 26 surface swabs and eight OPS collected in nine patient rooms . The impingement - based samples and cyclone - based samples were collected in four patient rooms . Cytopathic effects were observed in three OPS and one active air sample and All rights reserved .

The active air sample from the CDC - NIOSH sampler ( > 4µm size fraction ) had the lowest Ct - value of all environmental samples ( 29 . 5 ) and was derived from the room of the patient with the lowest OPS Ct - value ( 19 . 82 ) . Whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) In total , nine samples with RdRp Ct - values ranging from 19 . 8 to 30 . 2 were selected for SARS - CoV - 2 whole - genome sequencing , of which six OPS , one cyclone - based sample , one filtration - based sample and one surface swab . From five OPS samples , > 90 % of the reference was covered and uploaded in GISAID . All variants were B . 1 . 221 , a known variant , circulating in the Netherlands at the time of the study . Samples collected at the same location were closely genetically related . During the data collection from December 2020 until May 2021 , B . 1 . 1 . 7 , also known as the Alpha variant , became the dominant SARS - CoV - 2 circulating variant in the Netherlands 24 . The sequences have been registered in GISAID ( www . gisaid . org ; Accession ID EPI _ ISL _ 2259112 , EPI _ ISL _ 2259136 , EPI _ ISL _ 2259188 ) . See supplementary for more details and acknowledgement table . Longitudinal air monitoring Only seven of the 259 settling dust samples collected repeatedly in three wards were positive ( 2 . 7 % ) . All samples were collected in common areas in nursing homes where SARS - CoV - 2 infections had been reported among residents ( Supplement Table S7 ) . The low rate corroborates with the incidence of infections in patients and healthcare workers , which rapidly decreased during the study ( Table S7 ) . No viral RNA was detected in wards without registered SARS - CoV - 2 infected patients and / or healthcare workers shortly before or during sampling . Discussion In this study , comprising 679 environmental samples , SARS - CoV - 2 was frequently detected in air and on surfaces in the immediate surroundings of COVID - 19 patients , providing evidence of virus shedding to the environment through air by infected persons . SARS - CoV - 2 was detected more frequently in the particle size fraction 1 - 4μm ( respirable fraction ) and particulates > 4μm as compared to < 1μm . Airborne particulates might be infectious , as illustrated by the fact that we were able to replicate virus from an active air sample . Our results support the role of airborne transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 , which in turn is a risk factor for subsequent infection . SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was detected in all types of air samples and on high and low - touch surfaces in the surrounding of patients with a positive OPS . No SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was detected in air or the All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

The number of positive environmental samples in this study was high compared to other studies 1 , 25 . Although the study size is small to modest , environmental sampling was performed extensively around patients in early phase of infection , assuming active shedding of SARS - CoV - 2 . Previously , Van Beek et al . , established a shedding curve using data from 223 persons testing SARS - CoV - 2 in a drive - through test station , showing that viral loads were highest within eight days post onset of symptoms 15 . Moreover , Van Kampen et al . , reported that infectious virus shedding also occurred mainly within the first eight days post - onset , based on data from 129 hospitalised patients with repeated measurements 16 . Therefore , our study’s timing of environmental measurements has likely contributed to the high detection rate in environmental samples . This is in agreement with a study from Chia et al . only detecting SARS - CoV - 2 in air or the immediate surroundings of two patients infected less than eight days compared to no detection of SARS - CoV - 2 in the air of another patient nine days post - infection 4 . Several other studies were not able to detect SARS - CoV - 2 in air in the surrounding of patients more than eight days after post - onset of symptoms 4 , 25 , 26 . Also , studies in non - healthcare settings without patients in the early phase of infection , such as in secondary schools in the aftermath of SARS - CoV - 2 associated outbreaks , were not able the measure detectable levels of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA ( personal communication Dr . Wouters , 2021 ) . However , SARS - CoV - 2 was detected in great abundance in surroundings from infectious minks in acute phase in mink farms 19 . These observations emphasize that timing of sampling in the direct environment of patients and other populations is of importance for detecting SARS - CoV - 2 . Of the SARS - CoV - 2 containing aerosols , 54 % was in the size range < 4µm and 46 % in the size range of ≥ 4µm . When including samples with inconclusive qPCR test results , these figures hardly changed ( 50 % - 50 % ) . Although the use of the NIOSH sampler was modified by adding VTM to the vials prior to sampling , which may theoretically have altered size - selective sampling characteristics , our results are in line with other studies that performed size - selective sampling of SARS - CoV - 2 virus . For instance , Adenaiye et al . , analysed SARS - CoV - 2 virus in exhaled breath collected from 49 COVID - 19 cases ( mean days post - onset 3 . 8 ± 2 . 1 ) in an experimental setting and found SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in 36 % of fine ( ≤5µm ) , and 26 % of coarse ( > 5µm ) aerosols 27 . Moreover , other studies using the same CDC - NIOSH bio - sampler methodology as this study , exclusively detected SARS - CoV - 2 in the larger ≥ 4µm and intermediate size fraction 1 - 4µm in environmental samples collected in rooms of COVID - 19 patients in hospitals 4 , 5 . Similar observations in size distribution have been reported previously for human influenza virus 28 , 29 . These results for different viruses from infected patients indicate that a substantial part of particulates is found in the respirable fraction 28 .

Moreover , the strain - specific viral load and the location of infection in airways influence the particle size distribution and transmission mode to the environment . A different variant , such as Omikron , which is more contagious and is primarily present in the upper respiratory tract , might therefore distribute differently in the environment 30 . Out of ten active air samples eligible for culture , we were able to replicate virus from one sample . Only a few studies successfully showed signs of SARS - CoV - 2 replication in air samples 1 , 8 , 27 . However , underestimation of infectiousness is a likely consequence of virus inactivation during sample collection 29 . Current culture techniques may not be optimal for low viral concentrations as in air samples 31 . Overall , results suggest that virus particulates can cause infection in individuals who inhale these particulates when the infectious dose is sufficiently high . Literature on the infectious dose of SARS - CoV - 2 is scarce . Dabisch et al . reported an infectious dose of 52 TCID 50 for a seroconversion response and 256 TCID 50 for a fever response based on an inhalation exposure of 10 minutes in non - human primates Macaques 32 . Others have estimated an infectious dose for infection ranging between single and 1000 virions based on a model combining information on viral mutations obtained through deep sequencing and epidemiology in known infector - infectee pairs 33 – 35 . Based on the estimated relationship between E - gene RT - PCR Cq values and cell - cultured SARS - CoV - 2 virus loads by Schuijt et al . , the air sample which showed replication in our study contained approximately 170 000 viral copies per cubic meter of air 36 . Despite uncertainties associated with this simple calculation ( for instance , assuming similarity in RT - qPCR responses between cell - cultured virus and air samples ) , the estimated dose may indeed be capable of causing infection . Moreover , our measurements took place during relatively long periods . Environmental levels likely varied considerably over the sampling period . Variation in viral load could not be established over this time span . However , it is unlikely that viral shedding is constant over time . Coughing , for instance , results in higher viral RNA loads over a short time span . There is an ongoing debate on the airborne transmission route of SARS - CoV - 2 and the effect of ventilation on airborne transmission . Greenhalg et al . previously pointed out multiple reasons for airborne transmission as the main route of SARS - CoV - 2 37 , to which our study provides additional strength . First , our study detected SARS - CoV - 2 in abundance in air and on surfaces , including numerous low - touch surfaces such as on top of the wardrobe , which implicates viral dissemination through the air by aerosols . Second , SARS - CoV - 2 was primarily found in particle size fractions of 1 - 4μm and larger than 4 μm , which are known to stay airborne for extended periods of time and thus All rights reserved .

Third , we successfully cultured SARS - CoV - 2 from an active air sample from particle size > 4μm and aerosols have been reported to stay infectious in the air for up to 3 hours 38 . Based on our study , ultra - fine particles ( < 1μm ) , which can travel further , do not seem to be the key vehicle of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . Although virus contamination was omnipresent in air in infected patient rooms , the vast majority of settling dust and surface swab samples from common areas were negative , suggesting SARS - CoV - 2 transmission is more a local phenomenon than widespread . To mitigate ( occupational ) transmission risks , it is important to investigate the effect of ventilation and air filtration on airborne transmission reduction . To date , only Morris et al . investigated and successfully demonstrated removal of SARS - CoV - 2 from air by placing active filtration and sterilisation devices in wards 5 . Further research on the effect of ventilation and filtration devices is required to draw strong conclusions about the role of ventilation conditions in reducing airborne transmission . In conclusion , we gained insight into the extent of SARS - CoV - 2 presence in air and on surfaces in case of actively shedding patients . Furthermore , the environmental contamination of SARS - CoV - 2 and infectious aerosols confirm the potential for transmission via air up to several meters . These insights can contribute to the discussion on airborne transmission and facilitate effective design of prevention strategies such as use of facemasks and optimising ventilation conditions .

Air is drawn through an inhalable dust sampling head ( Conical Inhalable Sampler , JS Holdings , Stevenage , UK ) equipped with 37mm diameter 2 . 0 μm pore - size Teflon filter ( Pall incorporated , Ann Arbor , USA ) connected with tubing to a Gilian GilAir 5 pump ( Sensidyne , St . Petersburg , USA ) calibrated at a flow of 3 . 5 L / min . The sampling head were attached to a pole at 1 . 5m height as this is average breathing height . The sampling train was set up before the beginning of the measurement and lasted for 6 hours . In each patient room , three inhalable dust samplers were placed , one near the head of the patient , one near the feet of the patient and one near the location often used by healthcare worker ( Figure S1 ) . Cyclone - based sampler The cyclone - based technique allowed for size - selective sampling of dusts and aerosols from the environment . The CDC - NIOSH cyclone - based bioaerosol sampler ( NIOSH BC 251 , kindly provided to us by William G . Lindsley , NIOSH Morgantown , USA ) consists of a sampling body which is equipped with a 15ml conical tube ( Greiner Bio - One , Alphen aan de Rijn , Netherlands ) to capture aerosols larger than 4 μm in size , a 1 . 5ml conical tube ( Sarstedt BV , Etten - Leur , Netherlands ) to capture aerosols with a size ranging between 1 - 4 μm , and a 37mm diameter filter holder ( SKC Incorporated , Eighty Four , USA ) equipped with 37mm diameter 2 . 0 μm pore - size Teflon filter ( Pall incorporated , Ann Arbor , USA ) to collect particles of 1 μm and smaller . The filter holder was connected with tubing to a Gilian GilAir 5 pump ( Sensidyne , St . Petersburg , USA ) calibrated at a flow of 3 . 5 L / min . The 15ml and 1 . 5ml tube were pre - filled with 2 . 5ml and 1ml virus transport medium 1 ( VTM - 1 ; Erasmus Medical Center ( EMC ) , Rotterdam , The Netherlands ) , respectively , before start of the measurement ( table S1 composition of media ) . The sampling train was set up before the beginning of the measurement and lasted for 6 hours . In each patient room , one cyclone sampler was placed in conjunction with one of the filtration - based samplers close to the feet of the patient . After sampling filter holders were detached , packed in a Minigrip TM bag . The 15ml and 1 . 5ml tubes were detached from the sampling body , 1 ml Opti - MEM TM ( Gibco , UK ) and 1 ml of VTM - 1 / Opti - MEM TM mixture , respectively , was added to the tubes immediately after sampling . Impingement - based sampler Air sampling through impingement was conducted by means of a 5ml BioSampler ( SKC Inc , Eighty Four , USA ) positioned at 1 . 5m height attached to a pole . An airflow of 12 . 5 L / min through the BioSampler was established by connecting the outlet of the sampler to an inhouse designed pump All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

The impinger was filled with 4ml of VTM - 1 used for air sampling ( see above ) prior to the beginning of the measurement . The measurement lasted 1 hour close to the patient’s head , during which evaporation losses of VTM was replaced by adding every 15 minutes 2 ml of VTM - 1 . After sampling , remaining VTM fluid was transferred to a 15ml tube ( Greiner BioOne , Etten - Leur , Netherlands ) and 2 ml of Opti - MEM TM was added . Settling dust sampler Settling dust , passive air , samples were collected by using Electrostatic Dust Collectors ( EDCs ) ( Noss et al . , 2008 ) , which were placed in each included patient room and corresponding hallway , common living room and nurse office of the ward . EDCs were placed in holders pinned to the ceiling in the middle of the space . After 2 - 4 weeks of sampling EDCs were picked up and packed in a Minigrip TM bag for transportation . Collection of surface samples In each of the above areas : each included patient room , hallway , living room and nursing office , ten swab samples from surfaces were collected . Sampling locations included high - touch surfaces like door handle and tabletop and low - touch surfaces like top surface of cabinets . To standardize swabbing of surfaces , disposable plastic grids of 10 cm 2 were used ; when it was not possible to use the grid this was noted . Dry swabs ( Medical Wire Dry Swabs , MW370 , Corsham , UK ) were used , which were placed in 2ml viral transport medium 2 ( VTM - 2 ; Erasmus Medical Center ( EMC ) , Rotterdam , The Netherlands ) in 5ml tubes directly after swabbing ( for composition of media see table S2 ) . Patient characteristics Oropharyngeal swabs ( OPS ) was collected from patients during sample collection . Dry swabs ( Medical Wire Dry Swabs , 111598 , Milano , Italy ) were used , which were placed in 2ml VTM - 2 in 5ml tubes directly after swabbing . Laboratory analysis After collection , all samples , except for EDCs , were stored at 4 °C in electric transport cooling box and transported to the lab . At the lab , all samples , except for EDCs , were placed in 4°C storage until further processing the next day . All handlings were performed under BSL2 + conditions . In short , filters were removed from the filter holders and transferred to 5ml screw - top tubes ( Eppendorf , Nijmegen , Netherlands ) and 2ml of VTM - 1 used for air sampling was added , next tubes were vortexed for 5 minutes using a vortex adaptor .

After vortexing 600 μl was transferred and added to a tube containing 600 μl of MagNA Pure 96 External Lysis Buffer ( Roche Diagnostics , Almere the Netherlands ) , followed by 15 seconds of vortexing . Aliquots with remaining VTM from NIOSH , impingement , surface swab and OPS were stored frozen at - 80 ℃ for culturing . Aliquots with VTM / lysis buffer samples were stored frozen at - 80 ℃ for PCR . Settling dust sampler EDCs were transferred to tube containing 10 ml VTM - 2 . EDCs were tamped down with disposable pipette , followed by repeating twice 15 seconds of vortexing and soaked for 15 minutes and ended with 15 minutes of vortexing . EDCs were tamped down with disposable pipette and 600 ul sample was transferred and added to a tube containing 600 ul MagNA Pure 96 External Lysis Buffer ( Roche Diagnostics , Almere the Netherlands ) and followed by 15 seconds of vortexing . VTM / lysis buffer samples were stored frozen at - 80 ℃ . Real time quantitative RT - PCR Samples were transported on dry ice to Microvida Laboratory for Medical Microbiology , Bravis Hospital , Roosendaal , The Netherlands . Presence of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was tested using a SARS - CoV - 2 RNA RT - qPCR , targeting the E gene and CoV - 2 RdRP - gene of SARS - CoV - 2 . The cobas® SARS - CoV - 2 Test ( Roche Diagnostics , Basel , Switzerland ) was performed on the samples with lysis buffer using the cobas® 6800 Systems ( Roche Diagnostics ) . Samples were positive if the threshold was below Ct - value 40 . SARS - CoV - 2 Whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) Samples with RT - PCR RdRp Ct - values < 31 whole genome sequencing of the primary clinical specimen was performed by Microvida to determine the SARS - CoV - 2 variant . In short , total nucleic acids were extracted using the QIAsymphony DSP virus pathogen midi kit and pathogen complex 400 protocol of the QIAsymphony Sample Processing system ( Qiagen , Germany ) , with an input volume of 400 μL and output volume of 110 μL . cDNA was synthesized using LunaScript® RT SuperMix Kit ( New Engeland Biolabs , USA ) and library preparation was performed using EasySeqTM RC - PCR SARS - CoV - 2 Whole Genome Sequencing kit ( Nimagen , The Netherlands ) according to manufacturer’s instructions . Subsequent next generation sequencing ( NGS ) of 2x150cycles paired end reads was performed on a Miseq ( Illumina , The Netherlands ) using MiSeq Reagent Micro Kit v2 according to manufacturer’s instructions . Data analyses was performed with an in - house workflow using CLCbio Genomic Workbench v21 ( Qiagen , Germany ) , including ( a . o . ) read - trimming , NC _ 045512 . 2 ( NCBI genbank ) reference - based assembly , local re - alignment and variant detection algorithms .

The sequences were manually curated . Genomes with > 70 % genome coverage were included for lineage assignment using Pangolin ( https : / / pangolin . cog - uk . io / ) 39 and Nextclade Web ( https : / / clades . nextstrain . org / ) ( Hadfield et al . , 2018 ) ) . Genomes with > 90 % genome coverage were uploaded to GISAID ( https : / / www . gisaid . org / ) 40 , with accession IDs EPI _ ISL _ 3047866 , EPI _ ISL _ 3047867 , EPI _ ISL _ 2259188 , EPI _ ISL _ 2259136 and EPI _ ISL _ 2259122 and phylogenetic analysis performed using MAFFT alignment software ( Galaxy Version 7 . 221 . 3 , FFT - NS method ) 41 and phylogenomic software IQ - TREE 2 . 1 . 3 ( Galaxy Version 1 . 5 . 5 . 3 ) 42 – 44 , using ModelFinder ( with best predicted method GTR + F + I ) , ultrafast bootstrapping ( 1000 replicates ) and maximum likelihood tree reconstruction . Phylogenetic tree was visualized in CLCbio Genomic Workbench v20 . Virus culture Positive tested samples with RT - qPCR from the OPS , cyclone - based , impingement - based and surface swabs were transported on dry ice , using the duplex aliquot without lysis buffer for culturing at Erasmus University Medical Centre laboratory , Rotterdam , the Netherlands . Culturing was performed on Vero cells , clone 118 at 37°C , and 5 % CO 2 and was completed after 7 days . If virus - induced cytopathic effect was observed , immunofluorescent detection of nucleocapsid proteins was performed to confirm the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 16 . Modification in sample collection After the first outbreak investigation outbreak A , an optimised protocol was implemented . For the first outbreak investigation VTM - 2 was used as pre - fill in the tubes for the cyclone - based , impingement - based and re - fill for impingement sampling in instead of VTM - 2 . After sampling the impingement - based sampler VTM fluid was transferred to a 15 ml tube ( Greiner BioOne , Etten - Leur , Netherlands ) containing 1 , 5 ml Fetal Bovine Serum ( FSB ) ( 40 v / v % , Greiner Bio - One , Etten - Leur , Netherlands ) . Instead of adding Opti - MEM TM mixture or VTM / Opti - MEM TM mixture after sampling to the cyclone - based samples , the day after during processing only VTM - 2 was added up to the original amount prior to sample collection . Sampling and processing of surface swabs , OPS and EDCs stayed identical . All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .
