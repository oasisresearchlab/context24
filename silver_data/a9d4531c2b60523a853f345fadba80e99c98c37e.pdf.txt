Therefore , cooling or freezing the 24 samples is recommended in case of longer transportation times . In this study , the impact on 25 SARS - CoV - 2 detectability by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) was 26 assessed after prolonged unfrozen storage or repetitive freeze - thawing of SARS - CoV - 2 samples . 27 SARS - CoV - 2 positive patient swabs stored in viral transport medium ( VTM ) were exposed to 28 different temperatures ( 4°C , 25°C and 35°C ) and to repetitive freeze - thawing , to assess the effect 29 of storage conditions on RT - PCR detection . SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was still reliably detected by 30 RT - PCR after 21 days of storage in VTM , even when the samples had been stored at 35°C . The 31 change of Ct - value per day was 0 . 023 - 0 . 046 ( ±0 . 018 - 0 . 019 ) . Additionally , viral RNA was still 32 detected after 15 freeze - thaw cycles with a change of Ct value of 0 . 106 - 0 . 197 ( ±0 . 009 - 0 . 061 ) per 33 freeze - thaw cycle . However , compared to storage at 4°C , RNA was significantly less detectable 34 when stored at 25°C or 35°C , or after repeated freeze - thawing . The results of this study indicate 35 that viral RNA levels , as measured by RT - PCR assays , are significantly , but not substantially , 36 altered by prolonged unrefrigerated storage of up to 21 days at temperatures ranging up to 35°C 37 or after repeated freeze - thaw cycles . 38 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 INTRODUCTION 39 In late 2019 a novel Coronavirus , SARS - CoV - 2 , emerged which caused a pandemic in 2020 . 40 With a reproduction number ( R0 ) ranging from 1 . 4 to 3 . 9 ( depending on country - specific disease 41 prevention measures ) 1 , its infection rate was quickly determined to be higher than the seasonal 42 influenza with an R0 of 1 . 27 . 2 To identify infected patients , control and monitor the spread of the 43 virus , massive up - scaling of diagnostics capacities took place , for the detection of SARS - CoV - 2 44 viral RNA by reverse - transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) . 45 Transport and storage conditions that ensure the stability of SARS - CoV - 2 patient samples are 46 essential to generate accurate diagnostics results . Viral transport media ( VTM ) are well - 47 established , pH - buffered solutions that have been tested for a safe and stable transport of viral 48 sample material . 3 , 4 The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) 49 guidelines for sample shipment in VTM recommend sample storage at 2 - 8°C and shipping on ice 50 [ CDC , Interim Guidelines for Collecting , Handling , and Testing Clinical Specimens for COVID - 51 19 ( www . cdc . gov / coronavirus / 2019 - ncov / lab / guidelines - clinical - specimens . html , last accessed 52 06 . Jan . 2021 ) ] . In case of shipping delays that exceed 72 hours , storage at - 70°C and shipping on 53 dry ice are recommended . Despite these recommendations , sample transport within hospitals is 54 often performed at ambient temperature and can take several hours . Additionally , external 55 samples are frequently sent by courier and thus may be exposed to various environmental 56 temperatures . To assess if prolonged transportation affects SARS - CoV - 2 detectability , the 57 impact of three temperatures ( 4°C , 25°C , 35°C ) on viral RNA stability in VTM over 21 days was 58 tested . Additionally , as testing guidelines often require re - extraction of viral RNA to retest 59 inconclusive results during the diagnostics process , the impact of repetitive freeze - thaw cycles 60 was tested on SARS - CoV - 2 detection . 61 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 MATERIALS AND METHODS 62 Sample handling 63 VTM was produced according to the protocol of the Institute of Medical Virology , University of 64 Zurich , Switzerland : 500 mL of DMEM ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad CA , Cat . No . 41966 ) were 65 supplemented with 40 mL of HEPES ( 200mM , Invitrogen , Cat . No . 41966 ) , 50 mL heat - 66 inactivated fetal calf serum ( VWR , Radnor PA , Cat . No . P30 - 1902 ) , 5 mL 67 Pen / Strep / Amphotericin B ( 100x , Brunschwig , Basel , Switzerland , Cat . No . P06 - 07300 ) , 1 . 5 mL 68 Gentamicin ( 10mg / mL , Invitrogen , Cat . No . 15710 - 049 ) and 8 mL sodium bicarbonate ( 7 . 5 % 69 stock solution , Merck Millipore , Burlington MA , Cat . No . 1063290500 ) . 70 Five SARS - CoV - 2 positive samples from the routine diagnostics lab that were stored < 30d at - 71 20°C were thawed , diluted to 8 mL , and 210 µL aliquoted into cryotubes . The aliquots were then 72 incubated at 4°C , 25°C , or 35°C . Daily for the first 7d and after 10d , 14d , and 21d , respectively , 73 one tube each was collected and frozen at - 80°C until further analysis . The procedure was similar 74 for the freeze - thaw experiment ; here aliquots of three SARS - CoV - 2 positive samples were 75 freeze - thawed up to 15 times . The collected aliquots were thawed at the same time for RNA 76 extraction and RT - PCR analysis . The study was approved by the Kantonal Ethics Committee of 77 Zurich ( BASEC - Nr . Req . 2020 - 00659 ) . 78 79 RNA extraction 80 RNA was extracted with a KingFisher Flex Purification System ( Thermo Fisher , Waltham MA , 81 Cat . No . 5400610 ) . Home - brew solutions were used together with Fisher deepwell plates 82 ( Thermo Fisher , Cat . No . 97002540 ) as previously published 5 and adapted for our testing facility 6 : 83 Sample plates were loaded with 200 µL of aliquoted sample , mixed with 300 µL of lysis buffer 84 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 ( 2M guanidinium thiocyanate , 80 mM dithiothreitol , 25 mM sodium citrate , 20 µg / ml glycogen 85 and 0 . 5 % Triton - X 100 , pH 6 ) containing 1 µg carrier RNA ( Qiagen , Cat . No . 1017647 ) per well 86 and incubated for 10 minutes at room - temperature . Plates were run on the KingFisher Flex 87 machine with the following steps : 1 ) Incubation at 80°C for 10min . 2 ) Manual addition of 480 88 µL 100 % EtOH and 20 µl magnetic beads ( 10 µL sera - mag magnetic beads A and 10 µL 89 magnetic beads B , GE , Chicago IL , Cat . No . GE65152105050250 ) . 3 ) Bead / sample mixing for 5 90 min at room temperature . 4 ) Bead wash twice in 500 µL 70 % EtOH per well . 5 ) Elution of RNA 91 from beads in 100 µL nuclease free water . 92 93 RT - PCR 94 For the RT - PCR the TaqMan SARS - CoV - 2 Assay Kit v2 ( Thermo Fisher , Cat . No . CCU002NR ) 95 was used as described previously . 7 Each reaction contained 6 . 25 µL TaqPath 1 - Step Multiplex 96 Master Mix , NO ROX ( Thermo Fisher , Cat . No . A28523 ) , 1 . 25 µL TaqMan SARS - CoV - 2 Assay 97 Kit v2 ( primers and probes ) , 1 . 00 µL TaqMan MS2 Phage , 11 . 50 µL nuclease - free water and 5 98 µL of sample RNA , non - template nuclease - free water control ( NTC ) or TaqMan SARS - CoV - 2 99 Control Kitv2 ( CCU002NR ) positive control , respectively . The one - step RT - PCR was executed 100 on a QuantStudio 5 DX real - time PCR - System ( Thermo Fisher , Cat . No . A36324 ) machine with 101 the following steps : UNG incubation ( 25°C , 2 minutes ) , reverse - transcription ( 53 °C , 10 102 minutes ) , activation ( 95°C , 2 minutes ) and 45 cycles of denaturation ( 95°C , 3 seconds ) and 103 annealing / extension ( 60°C , 30 seconds ) . 104 105 Statistical analysis 106 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 Using R ( v4 . 0 . 3 ) , linear regression was calculated to determine the line of best fit for a 107 relationship between Ct value and storage time ( in days ) or freeze - thaw cycles , respectively . In 108 order to compare these regression lines , we fit a linear mixed model ( lme4 package v1 . 1 - 26 8 ) 109 expressing Ct as a function of time / thaw cycle , treatment , and their interaction , with sample ID 110 as a random effect and including the baseline measurement of each gene / sample combination as 111 a covariate . Differences between treatments were assessed by calculating and comparing 112 estimated marginal trends of the time ( or cycle ) vs . treatment interaction term ( emmeans package 113 v1 . 5 . 4 9 ) . Within the freeze - thaw experiment , we assessed whether RNA detectability differed 114 between 5 , 10 , and 15 cycles , by fitting a linear mixed model as above and calculating the 115 pairwise differences between estimated marginal means of each set of measurements . 116 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 RESULTS 117 Sars - CoV - 2 Is Stable in VTM Over 21 Days at 4°C , 25°C and 35°C . 118 First , the impact of prolonged unrefrigerated storage on the detectability of the SARS - CoV - 2 119 virus was tested . Therefore , five positive SARS - CoV - 2 nasopharyngeal swab samples that were 120 stored in VTM were diluted and aliquoted to assess their stability at three different temperatures 121 ( 4°C , 25°C and 35°C ) over a period of 21 days . 122 The initial Ct - values ( at day 0 ) of all three targets ( i . e . , N gene , ORF1ab , and S gene ) of the five 123 samples ranged from 20 - 30 ( Figure 1A - C ) . Over the complete experimental time of 21 days , 124 SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was detected in samples stored in all three incubation temperatures ( Figure 125 1A - C ) . For each target and temperature , a linear regression was calculated for the Ct - values over 126 time ( Error ! Reference source not found . ) , where the slope value corresponds to the Ct - value 127 change per day . All slopes were low , reflecting a stable virus load over the entire experimental 128 time . On average , the largest Ct value changes per day were found in samples exposed to 35°C 129 with 0 . 023 - 0 . 046 ( ±0 . 018 - 0 . 021 ) for the three target genes . Compared to the 4°C exposure , the 130 changes in Ct value significantly differed in the 25°C exposure ( p < 0 . 0001 ) and the 35°C 131 exposure ( p < 0 . 0001 ) . However , the changes in Ct value in the 25°C and 35°C exposures did not 132 significantly differ between each other ( p = 0 . 19 , Figure 2 ) . 133 134 Repetitive Freeze - Thaw Cycles Have a Stronger Impact on Sars - CoV - 2 135 Stability in VTM Than Storage at 4°C , 25°C , or 35°C . 136 Next , the influence of freeze - thawing on the Ct - values of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was examined . 137 The effect of 1 , 5 , 10 , and 15 freeze - thaw cycles was evaluated by snap - freezing three samples in 138 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 liquid nitrogen and thawing them at room - temperature until fully thawed ( Figure 2 ) . After 5 139 freeze - thaw cycles , the Ct - values were significantly higher than after 1 cycle ( p = 0 . 0005 ) , and 140 after 10 cycles Ct values were significantly higher than after 5 cycles ( p < 0 . 0001 ) , but after 15 141 cycles the Ct values did not detectably differ from those after 10 cycles ( p = 0 . 51 ) . After 15 142 freeze - thaw cycles , the virus was still detectable with little difference in Ct - values compared to 143 the original sample which was only freeze - thawed once . A linear regression was calculated for 144 the Ct - values for each target , where the slope represents the change of Ct - value per freeze - thaw 145 cycle ( Error ! Reference source not found . ) . The average of the three samples showed minor 146 Ct - value changes per freeze - thaw cycle with 0 . 106 - 0 . 197 ( ±0 . 009 - 0 . 061 ) for the three target 147 genes . This changing Ct - value was greater under freeze - thaw conditions than for all the storage 148 temperature conditions ( p < 0 . 0001 for all comparisons , Figure 2 ) . 149 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 DISCUSSION 150 The transport of nasopharyngeal / oropharyngeal swabs to testing laboratories relies on local 151 infrastructures and thus optimal sample logistics may not always be available . While the CDC 152 official guidelines recommend transport on ice , some of the specimens might be transported 153 without cooling and may therefore be exposed to environmental temperatures . In our hospital for 154 example , specimen transport is accomplished at ambient temperatures and some specimens took 155 several hours until they arrived in our laboratory . We were wondering whether we still would 156 reliably detect SARS - CoV - 2 in these cases and to what degree temperature differences 157 influenced Ct values . To answer this question , the stability of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus in VTM 158 was tested over time at different temperatures and after different numbers of freeze - thaw cycles . 159 Our data show that the virus can still be reliably detected when patient swabs in VTM are 160 exposed to up to 35°C for as long as 21 days , with minor but significant changes of the Ct - values 161 per day . The VTM that was used here contained antibiotics and antimycotics . No contamination 162 i . e . , overgrowth of bacteria or fungi was observed even after prolonged exposure at 35°C . 163 However , it might still be important to store samples cooled , to prevent contamination , which 164 could interfere with RNA extraction and RT - PCR . The samples used in this experiment had a 165 moderately high viral load , i . e . the Ct - values were between 20 - 30 cycles . We believe that the 166 high stability also accounts for samples with lower viral loads , e . g . Ct values between 30 - 35 167 cycles . However , it cannot be fully excluded that low positive samples with initial Ct - values 168 between 35 - 40 cycles might appear negative after a longer storage period at higher temperatures . 169 As previously reported , viral titers strongly vary between individuals and based on time of 170 infection . 10 Low titers generally pose a risk for false negative results for any RT - PCR 171 assay . 10 Thus , for SARS - CoV - 2 exposed individuals , the CDC recommends performing tests 172 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 repeatedly at different time points post - exposure to decrease the risk of false negative results 173 [ CDC , SARS - CoV - 2 Testing Strategy : Considerations for Non - Healthcare Workplaces 174 ( www . cdc . gov / coronavirus / 2019 - ncov / community / organizations / testing - non - healthcare - 175 workplaces . html , last accessed 21 . Oct . 2020 ) . Furthermore , most of the SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR 176 assays cover two or more target genes and recommend test - repetition if only one target gene is 177 detected . 7 178 Similar to unfrozen storage over 21d , freeze - thawing had a moderate but significant effect on the 179 Ct values of the samples . Notably , multiple freeze - thawing resulted in higher Ct values than 180 storage at 4ºC , 25ºC , or 35 ºC for 21 days . Further studies with more samples with differing 181 initial viral loads are necessary to confirm the generalizability of this observation . However , 182 based on these data , aliquoting or cooled storage of viral swab material up to 21d should be 183 preferred over multiple freeze - thawing . 184 The limitations of this study are , first that only moderately high positive samples were tested . 185 Therefore , our conclusion might only be true for at least moderately high positive ( Ct - values 186 < 30 ) samples . Second , only one VTM formulation , adopted from the Institute of Medical 187 Virology of the University of Zurich ( Switzerland ) , was tested rather than a commercially 188 available VTM . Third , while the impact of storage temperature and freeze - thawing were assessed , 189 other environmental factors such as ultraviolet light exposure during sample transportation was 190 not examined . 191 In conclusion , our data suggest that testing facilities can perform SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR 192 diagnostics assays on nasopharyngeal / oropharyngeal swabs stored in VTM , despite 193 transportation temperatures that exceed 4°C for prolonged periods , although temperatures of 25° 194 and above have a moderate but significant influence on Ct values . In addition , repetitive freeze - 195 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 11 thaw cycles significantly increase Ct values , although only moderately and not to the degree that 196 it will substantially alter the viral detectability . 197 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 Acknowledgements 198 We thank the Levesque lab , the Bosshard lab , all members of the Zürich dermatology biobank 199 ( University Hospital Zurich ) and all members of the dermatology diagnostics laboratory 200 ( University Hospital Zurich ) for their exceptional efforts in setting up an emergency SARS - CoV - 201 2 PCR testing facility at the beginning of the COVID - 19 pandemic in spring 2020 .
