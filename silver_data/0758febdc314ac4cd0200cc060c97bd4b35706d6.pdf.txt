Although GFP - based GECIs are widely used for in vivo neurophysiology , GECIs with red - shifted excitation and emission spectra have advantages for in vivo imaging because of reduced scattering and absorption in tissue , and a consequent reduction in phototoxicity . However , current red GECIs are inferior to the state - of - the - art GFP - based GCaMP6 indicators for detecting and quantifying neural activity . Here we present improved red GECIs based on mRuby ( jRCaMP1a , b ) and mApple ( jRGECO1a ) , with sensitivity comparable to GCaMP6 . We characterized the performance of the new red GECIs in cultured neurons and in mouse , Drosophila , zebrafish and C . elegans in vivo . Red GECIs facilitate deep - tissue imaging , dual - color imaging together with GFP - based reporters , and the use of optogenetics in combination with calcium imaging . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 12727 . 001 Introduction Genetically - encoded calcium indicators ( GECIs ) enable non - invasive measurement of neuronal activ - ity in vivo . Activity can be tracked across multiple spatial scales , from synapses ( Chen et al . , 2013b ) to populations of thousands of neurons ( Ahrens et al . , 2013 ; Peron et al . , 2015 ) . Neuronal dynam - ics can be probed over times of milliseconds ( Chen et al . , 2013a ; O’Connor et al . , 2013 ; Li et al . , 2015 ) to months ( Huber et al . , 2012 ; Margolis et al . , 2012 ) . Green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - based GECIs ( Tian et al . , 2009 ; Akerboom et al . , 2012 ; Ohkura et al . , 2012 ; Chen et al . , 2013b ) , such as GCaMP6 ( Chen et al . , 2013b ) , are widely used for imaging neural activity . GCaMP6 indicators exhibit excellent signal - to - noise ratio , allowing detection of single action potentials ( APs ) in many sit - uations ( Chen et al . , 2013b ; Peron et al . , 2015 ) . Applications of GCaMPs and other widely used GECIs are limited by their excitation and emission spectra . GCaMPs are difficult to use in transgenic animals that already express other GFP - based pro - teins . The blue excitation light used in standard wide - field microscopy can cause photodamage and is highly scattered in tissue . The green GCaMP emission is absorbed by blood ( Svoboda and Block , 1994 ) , which reduces the penetration depth of imaging in vertebrates in vivo . In addition , the GCaMP excitation spectrum overlaps with those of light - sensitive ion channels , including channelrho - dopsin - 2 ( ChR2 ) ( Nagel et al . , 2003 ) , which complicates the simultaneous use of green GECIs and optogenetics . Red - shifted GECIs thus promise three main advantages over GFP - based sensors : increased maximal imaging depth , parallel use of a red GECI with light - sensitive ion channels for all - Dana et al . eLife 2016 ; 5 : e12727 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 12727 1 of 24 TOOLS AND RESOURCES optical neurophysiology experiments , and reduced photodamage . In addition , together with existing green GECIs , red GECIs allow simultaneous imaging of multiple components of neuronal circuitry . Current red GECIs share overall architecture with the GCaMP sensors . They are based on circu - larly permuted red fluorescent proteins ( RFPs ) , a calcium - binding protein ( calmodulin ) and a binding peptide ( M13 or ckkap ) . RCaMP1 ( Akerboom et al . , 2013 ) is derived from mRuby ( Kredel et al . , 2009 ) , whereas R - GECO ( Zhao et al . , 2011 ; Wu et al . , 2014 ) and R - CaMP2 ( Inoue et al . , 2015 ) are derived from mApple ( Shaner et al . , 2008 ) . R - GECO is more sensitive than RCaMP1 . However , mApple - based GECIs , such as R - GECO and R - CaMP2 , exhibit photoswitching when illuminated with blue light , causing a transient increase of red fluorescence that complicates their use in optogenetics ( Akerboom et al . , 2013 ; Wu et al . , 2013 ) . Here we performed large - scale structure - guided muta - genesis and neuron - based screening ( Wardill et al . , 2013 ) to develop improved red GECIs , starting with RCaMP1h ( Akerboom et al . , 2013 ) and R - GECO1 ( Zhao et al . , 2011 ) . We report on the mRuby - based jRCaMP1a and jRCaMP1b , and mApple - based jRGECO1a , all of which show several - fold improved sensitivity for detecting neural activity compared to their parent scaffolds . Results Protein engineering R - GECO1 and RCaMP1 are based on circularly permuted mApple ( Shaner et al . , 2008 ) and mRuby ( Kredel et al . , 2009 ) , respectively , fused to calmodulin ( CaM ) and the CaM - interacting M13 peptide ( Crivici and Ikura , 1995 ) . In the presence of calcium , CaM undergoes a conformational change and associates with M13 to form a complex proximal to the chromophore inside the RFP b - barrel ( Akerboom et al . , 2009 ; 2013 ) . The conformational change modifies the chromophore environ - ment , modulating solvent access , chromophore pK a , absorption , and quantum yield , and altogether results in increased RFP brightness . Structure - guided mutagenesis and screening in a neuron - based assay have been successful in improving GCaMP sensitivity and kinetics ( Akerboom et al . , 2012 ; Chen et al . , 2013b ) . Here we applied a similar approach to red GECIs . We focused mutagenesis on the interfaces between the RFP and CaM , between CaM and M13 , and within CaM itself ( 78 / 442 and 87 / 451 amino acid positions were mutated to near saturation in RCaMP1h and R - GECO1 , respectively , see Supplementary files 1 – 2 ) ( Figure 1a ) . These regions are structurally homologous to the regions previously explored in the engineering of GCaMP6 ( Chen et al . , 2013b ) . Single - mutation variants ( 934 RCaMP1h ; 689 R - GECO1 , Supplementary files 1 – 2 ) were tested in an automated neuronal assay ( Wardill et al . , 2013 ) ( Figure 1b – d ) . Dissociated eLife digest Neurons encode information with brief electrical pulses called spikes . Monitoring spikes in large populations of neurons is a powerful method for studying how networks of neurons process information and produce behavior . This activity can be detected using fluorescent protein indicators , or “probes” , which light up when neurons are active . The best existing probes produce green fluorescence . However , red fluorescent probes would allow us to see deeper into the brain , and could also be used with green probes to image the activity and interactions of different neuron types simultaneously . However , existing red fluorescent probes are not as good at detecting neural activity as green probes . By optimizing two existing red fluorescent proteins , Dana et al . have now produced two new red fluorescent probes , each with different advantages . The new protein indicators detect neural activity with high sensitivity and allow researchers to image previously unseen brain activity . Tests showed that the probes work in cultured neurons and allow imaging of the activity of neurons in mice , flies , fish and worms . History has shown that enhancing the techniques used to study biological processes can lead to fundamentally new insights . In the future , Dana et al . would therefore like to make even more sensitive protein indicators that will allow larger networks of neurons deeper in the brain to be imaged .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 12727 3 of 24 Tools and Resources Neuroscience rat hippocampal neurons in 96 - well plates were transfected with plasmids expressing red GECI var - iants ( RCaMP1h variant or R - GECO1 variant ) . To normalize for expression level , the plasmid also expressed GFP that was localized to the nucleus . R - GECO1 and RCaMP1h were both expressed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus ( data not shown ) . To sense calcium selectively in the cyto - plasm we added a nuclear export sequence ( NES ) to the N - termini of R - GECO1 , RCaMP1h , and all their variants . As expected , addition of the NES restricted expression to the cytoplasm ( Figure 1b ) . R - CaMP2 was excluded from the nucleus without the NES . A field electrode triggered trains of action potentials ( APs ) in all neurons within each well ( Materials and methods , [ Wardill et al . , 2013 ] ) . Time - lapse images ( 800 m m x 800 m m fields of view ; 35 Hz ) were acquired before , during and after stimulation . Fluorescence changes were extracted from single neurons to compute the sensitivity , dynamic range , and kinetics of the responses to vari - ous trains of APs . Individual red GECI variants were compared to the parent constructs and pub - lished GECIs , including R - CaMP2 ( Inoue et al . , 2015 ) , GCaMP6s , and GCaMP6f ( Chen et al . , 2013b ) . Numerous single mutations ( 353 / 934 RCaMP1h ; 187 / 689 R - GECO1 , Supplementary files 1 – 2 ) improved sensitivity compared to the parent proteins ( higher D F / F 0 amplitude in response to one AP ; p < 0 . 01 , Wilcoxon rank sum test ) ( Figure 1c , d ) . For example , T46W , I60N , and I60T exhibited enhanced sensitivity and accelerated kinetics compared to RCaMP1h . I109K had similar effects on R - GECO1 . M339F accelerated kinetics but did not affect response amplitude of R - GECO1 . Beneficial mutations were sorted based on improved response amplitudes ( in response to trains of 1 , 3 , and 10 APs ) and / or faster kinetics , without a significant reduction in the maximal fluorescence change eli - cited by 160 APs . Beneficial mutations were combined in a second round of mutagenesis ( 136 RCaMP1h and 166 R - GECO1 variants ) ( Figure 1c , d ) . Based on criteria similar to those outlined above , two new mRuby - based sensors , jRCaMP1a and jRCaMP1b , and one mApple - based sensor , jRGECO1a , were selected for in - depth analysis ( red bars in the histograms of Figure 1c , d ) . These sensors have similar absorp - tion and emission spectra to each other and their parent constructs but they differ in sensitivity for detecting neural activity , kinetics , and other biophysical properties ( (cid:0) Figure 2 , Figure 2—figure supplement 1 – 2 , Figure 2—source data 1 ) . jRGECO1a is the most sensitive indicator , with 8 . 5 - fold larger D F / F 0 amplitude for 1AP stimuli and faster rise time than R - GECO1 ( Figure 2 ) . Decay time and maximal D F / F 0 amplitude were similar to R - GECO1 . The improved amplitude and faster rise kinetics were associated with a tighter appar - ent calcium affinity ( Figure 2—source data 1 ) . jRGECO1a response amplitudes and kinetics are comparable to GCaMP6f for brief trains of 1 – 10 APs ( Chen et al . , 2013b ) . Similar to other mApple - based indicators , jRGECO1a exhibits photoswitching in response to blue light ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ) . jRCaMP1a and jRCaMP1b were also much improved compared to their parent sensors ( 24 - fold and 13 - fold improved sensitivity for detecting 1 AP stimuli ) ( Figure 2 ) . jRCaMP1a has higher sensitiv - ity and slower decay kinetics than jRCaMP1b . jRCaMP1b has a larger dynamic range , without satura - tion in the range of 1 – 160 APs ( Figure 2c ) . Both jRCaMP1a and jRCaMP1b have higher calcium affinities than RCaMP1h ( Figure 2—source data 1 ) . However , jRCaMP1a has very limited dynamic range in cultured neurons and solution ( 160 ± 25 % and 320 ± 10 % respectively , mean ± s . d . ) . jRCaMP1a and jRCaMP1b are two - fold brighter than jRGECO1a in the calcium - bound state ( Fig - ure 2—figure supplement 2 ) . Similar to RCaMP1h , jRCaMP1a and jRCaMP1b did not exhibit photo - switching ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ) . This allows independent photostimulation and imaging in neurons that co - express ChR2 and jRCaMP1a / b ( Figure 2—figure supplement 4 ) . Red protein calcium indicators in mouse V1 We tested jRGECO1a , jRCaMP1a , jRCaMP1b , their parent indicators , and R - CaMP2 ( Inoue et al . , 2015 ) in the mouse primary visual cortex ( V1 ) in vivo ( Chen et al . , 2013b ) ( Figure 3a , Video 1 ) .

V1 neurons were infected with adeno - associated virus ( AAV ) expressing one of the red GECI variants under the human synapsin1 promoter ( AAV - SYN1 - red GECI variant ) and imaged 16 – 180 days later . Two - photon excitation was performed with a tunable ultrafast laser ( Insight DS + ; Spectra - Physics ) running at 1040 nm or 1100 nm . L2 / 3 neurons showed red fluorescence in the neuronal cytoplasm . Visual stimuli consisted of moving gratings presented in eight directions to the contralateral eye ( Akerboom et al . , 2012 ; Chen et al . , 2013b ) . Regions of interest corresponding to single neurons revealed visual stimulus - evoked fluorescence transients that were stable across trials and tuned to stimulus orientation ( Figure 3b ) . Orientation tuning was similar for all constructs tested ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . Fluorescence transients tracked the dynamics of the sensory stimuli ( Figure 3b – d , Video 1 ) . mApple - based indicators tracked more faithfully than mRuby - based indicators because of their faster kinetics ( signal half - decay time after end of stimulus was 300 ± 22 ms for R - GECO1 , 175 cells ; 390 ± 20 ms , jRGECO1a , 395 cells ; 330 ± Figure 2 . jRGECO1 and jRCaMP1 performance in dissociated neurons .

For jRCaMP1a and jRCaMP1b this fraction was 8 - and 6 - fold higher than for RCaMP1h ( p < 10 - 6 , Wilcoxon rank - sum test ) , and comparable to GCaMP6f . For jRGECO1a , the fraction was 60 % higher than for R - GECO1 ( p = 0 . 012 ) , 40 % higher than R - CaMP2 ( p = 0 . 03 ) , 30 % higher than GCaMP6f ( p = 0 . 1 ) , but 40 % lower than GCaMP6s ( p < 10 - 4 ) . The mean D F / F 0 at the preferred visual stimulus ( Materials and methods ) also showed enhanced sensitivity for jRCaMP1a and jRCaMP1b com - pared to RCaMP1h ( Figure 3f ) . jRGECO1a responses in vivo were larger than other red GECIs and GCaMP6f , but still smaller than GCaMP6s responses . Long - term and high expression of GCaMP was reported to affect neuronal health ( Tian et al . , 2009 ; Chen et al . , 2013b ) . GCaMP6 nuclear - filled cells show attenuated responses to sensory stimuli , slower decay times , and degraded orientation selectivity ( Tian et al . , 2009 ; Chen et al . , 2013b ) . We expressed jRGE - CO1a , jRCaMP1a , and jRCaMP1b for more than 130 days in mouse V1 . Unlike GCaMP indicators , nuclear filling was not observed ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2a ) , presumably due to the NES in the red GECI sequences . Red GECIs showed stable performance over time , although a small decrease of orientation selectivity was observed for jRCaMP1b after 180 days of expression ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2b – d ) . Interestingly , long - term expression with the tested red GECIs seems to be more stable than with GCaMP6s ( Chen et al . , 2013b ) . These data suggest that jRGECO1a and jRCaMP1a / jRCaMP1b can be used in experiments requiring long - term expression . The measured jRGECO1a and jRCaMP1a responses in the visual cortex were smaller than expected based on measurements in cultured neurons ( Figure 2a , Figure 4c ) and lower than those produced by GCaMP6s ( Chen et al . , 2013b ) . High - resolution microscopy of fixed brain tissue sec - tions revealed bright fluorescent punctae in neurons labeled with jRGECO1a but not with jRCaMP1a / b . jRGECO1a punctae co - localized with LAMP - 1 , a marker of lysosomes ( Figure 4—fig - ure supplement 1a ) ( Katayama et al . , 2008 ) . Similar punctae were also found in cultured neurons , but were less numerous ( Wilcoxon rank sum test , p < 0 . 001 , Figure 4—figure supplement 1b ) . When imaged in vivo , ROIs containing punctae had higher baseline fluorescence by 90 % but lower peak D F / F 0 by 20 % compared to their surrounding soma ( 10 cells and 39 punctae , Figure 4—figure sup - plement 1c ) . This implies that accumulation of fluorescent , non - responsive jRGECO1a in lysosomes reduces the signal - to - noise ratio for in vivo imaging . We also detected green fluorescence ( 500 – 550 nm ) in the in vivo images of all red GECIs imaged in V1 . Green fluorescence was visible with 900 nm excitation , but not with 1040 nm excitation , sug - gesting that red GECIs partition into at least two species . The green fluorescence was distributed unevenly across the cytoplasm and does not report calcium ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 , 3a – b ) . Indeed , jRGECO1a neurons with larger fractional fluorescence intensity at 900 nm showed lower response amplitudes . Longer expression times for jRGECO1a increased relative intensity at 900 nm and similarly correlated with lower peak D F / F 0 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3c – d , F test , p - value < 0 . 002 ) . These data suggest that long - term expression in the mammalian brain can degrade sensitivity of the red GECIs . Imaging with red probes suffers less from scattering of excitation light and absorption of fluores - cence compared with GFP - based sensors ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) , which could allow deeper imaging in vivo ( Horton et al . , 2013 ) . To estimate how fluorescence decays with imaging depth we imaged apical dendrites from layer ( L ) 5 cells ( Figure 5a ) . We fitted an exponential decay to the fluorescence signal measured as a function of depth . Red GECI fluorescence decayed much more slowly ( 130 ± 30 m m ; median ± s . d . , 19 dendrites , n = 3 mice infected with RCaMP1h , R - Video 1 . jRGECO1a L2 / 3 functional imaging in the mouse V1 .

This enhanced imaging depth enabled , for example , imaging deep in L6 . We infected L6 neurons by injecting AAV - SYN1 - FLEX - jRCaMP1a virus into the visual cortex of NTSR1 - cre ( a L6 - specific marker ) mice ( Gong et al . , 2007 ) .

The spectral properties of red GECIs allow dual - color imaging together with green GCaMP6 indi - cators . To demonstrate dual - color functional imaging in spatially intermingled neuronal processes , a FLEX - SYN1 - jRGECO1a AAV was injected into V1 of mouse lines expressing cre recombinase specifi - cally in L5 neurons ( KJ18 - cre [ Gerfen et al . , 2013 ] ) and SYN1 - GCaMP6s AAV was injected into corti - cal LM , which sends axons to V1 ( Andermann et al . , 2011 ; Oh et al . , 2014 ) . A single excitation source at 1000 nm was used to excite both indicators . Imaging was performed in L1 of V1 , where signals from overlapping axons and dendrites could be reliably detected ( Figure 6 , Video 2 ) . We note that bleaching of the red GECI was low when imaging relatively large cellular compartments , such as cell bodies or apical dendrites ( Video 1 – 2 ) , but significant bleaching was seen for thin axons . Larger compartments are more forgiving because of the dynamic balance between bleaching and diffusion of the imaged molecules . Relationship between spikes and fluorescence dynamics We characterized the relationship between somatic fluorescence changes and spiking in L2 / 3 cells by combining imaging with loose - seal , cell - attached recordings ( Figure 4a , b ) . The visual stimulus was adjusted online so that a large range of instantaneous firing rates was recorded for each cell . Figure 6 . Dual color imaging in the mouse visual cortex .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 12727 10 of 24 Tools and Resources Neuroscience Imaging was performed at high zoom to detect transients with the highest signal - to - noise ratio ( Peron et al . , 2015 ) . jRGECO1a fluorescence changes allowed relatively robust detection of activity ( Figure 4c , d ) . Single spikes were detected with 82 % accuracy ( 5 % false - positive rate , n = 11 cells from 6 animals , 199 spikes ) ( Figure 4e , f ) . Two APs in a time bin of 100 ms were detected with 96 % accuracy ( 5 % false - posi - tive rate , 70 events ) . Fluorescence changes of jRCaMP1a were smaller , with a detection rate for 1AP and 2AP events of 65 % and 80 % respec - tively ( 5 % false - positive rate , n = 10 cells from 5 animals , 135 and 65 events respectively ) . jRGE - CO1a showed higher D F / F 0 amplitudes and bet - ter detection than jRCaMP1a over the entire range of AP bursts ( Figure 4d – f ) . jRGECO1a also had faster kinetics ( Figure 4g ) . Measured rise and decay time of jRGECO1a and jRCaMP1a were similar to GCaMP6f and GCaMP6s , respec - tively ( Chen et al . , 2013b ) . Red protein calcium indicators in Drosophila , zebrafish , and C . elegans We next tested red GECIs in flies , zebrafish and worms . Red GECIs were expressed pan - neuronally in transgenic flies ( R57C10 - Gal4 ) . Boutons were imaged in the larval neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) after electrical stimulation ( Figure 7a , b ; Materials and methods ) ( Hendel et al . , 2008 ) . Consistent with cultured neuron data , we saw a significant boost of single AP sensitivity in jRGECO1a , jRCaMP1a , and jRCaMP1b variants compared to their parent indicators ( p < 0 . 008 for all comparisons ; Wilcoxon rank sum test ; Figure 7c , Figure 7—figure supplement 1 – 2 , Figure 7—source data 1 – 2 ) . Peak response amplitudes of jRGECO1a and jRCaMP1a outperform GCaMP6s in the 1 – 5 Hz stim - ulation range ( single AP D F / F 0 amplitude 11 . 6 ± 0 . 9 % , 8 . 6 ± 0 . 5 % , and 4 . 5 ± 0 . 3 % respectively , mean ± s . e . m ; Figure 7c , Figure 7—figure supplement 3 , Figure 7—source data 3 ; 12 FOVs for jRGE - CO1a ; 11 , jRCaMP1a ; 12 , GCaMP6f ; n = 7 flies for all constructs ) . The decay kinetics of jRGECO1a ( half decay time at 160 Hz : 0 . 42 ± 0 . 02 s , mean ± s . e . m ) was similar to GCaMP6f ( 0 . 43 ± 0 . 01 s ; Figure 7d , Figure 7—figure supplement 3 , Figure 7—source data 3 ) . The combination of high sensitivity and fast kinetics for jRGECO1a allows detection of individual spikes on top of the response envelope for stimuli up to 10 Hz ( Figure 7b , Figure 7—figure supplement 1 ) . Red GECIs were also expressed pan - neuronally in transgenic zebrafish under the elavl3 / HuC pro - moter ( elavl3 : GECI ) . Fish showing strong expression in the trigeminal ( Tg ) neurons 3 – 4 days post fer - tilization ( dpf ) were selected for imaging . Tg neurons are usually silent and fire one or few spikes in response to touch ( Douglass et al . , 2008 ) . Brief trains of electrical stimulation pulses ( 20 ms each ; 1 , 5 , and 10 pulses at 20 Hz ) , which are known to stimulate Tg neurons ( Akerboom et al . , 2013 ) , were used to elicit responses in these cells and image calcium transients ( Figure 8a ; widefield one - photon imaging , Materials and methods ) . Similar to results from cultured rat hippocampal neurons , mice , and Drosophila , jRGECO1a was the most sensitive red GECI tested in this assay : its response to one and five pulses outperformed all other GECIs , including GCaMP6f and GCaMP6s ( Figure 8b , c ) . For higher numbers of stimulus pulses the jRGECO1a response was partially saturated . jRCaMP1a and jRCaMP1b exhibited large improvements in sensitivity over their parent indicator , RCaMP1h , and also higher sensitivity than R - CaMP2 , with jRCaMP1b showing faster kinetics than jRCaMP1a ( Figure 8d ) . Finally , Red GECIs were tested in the ASH and AWC neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans , two sen - sory neurons with distinct graded signaling properties ( Akerboom et al . , 2012 ; Kato et al . , 2014 ) . ASH neurons , which respond to noxious stimuli with calcium increases , were exposed to high - osmo - larity glycerol in one second pulses alternating with buffer ( Figure 9a , b ) . All tested GECIs exhibited an initial increase in fluorescence that was strongest for jRCaMP1b , jRCEGO1a , and R - GECO1 ( D F / F 0 amplitude ~ 250 % , Figure 9b ) , followed by modulation of the fluorescence signal and a slow Video 2 .

AWC neurons , which are tonically active and inhib - ited by odor , were exposed to a one minute pulse of 92 m M isoamyl alcohol alternating with buffer ( Figure 9d ) . jRGECO1a and jRCaMP1b robustly detected the three known components of the odor Figure 8 .

R - GECO1 and RCaMP1h , which have weaker affinity for calcium , did not detect the odor - induced calcium decrease well , whereas jRCaMP1a truncated the overshoot after odor removal ( Figure 9d , e ) and had the slowest kinetics ( Figure 9f ) . In summary , jRCaMP1b performed best in detection of graded calcium signals , whereas jRGECO1a had advantages in response speed . Discussion GFP - based GECIs are well - established tools for studying neuronal activity across many model organ - isms . Current state - of - the - art green GECIs , such as GCaMP6 , have sufficient sensitivity to detect sin - gle action potentials in diverse cell types and even detect activity of single synapses . They can be targeted to specific cell types and subcellular compartments . Red GECIs can potentially be used in a similar manner with additional advantages . For example , they suffer less from tissue scattering and Figure 9 . Imaging activity in the C . elegans ASH and AWC neurons with red GECIs .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 12727 14 of 24 Tools and Resources Neuroscience absorption . In addition , rhodopsin - based optogenetic tools have substantial absorption in the blue region of the wavelength spectrum , which overlaps with the excitation spectrum of GFP . Red GECIs can be imaged without exciting ChR2 . We developed red GECIs that rival best - of - class green GECIs in terms of sensitivity for detecting neural activity , thereby closing a significant performance gap between red and green GECIs . The new mApple - based jRGECO1a and the mRuby - based jRCaMP1a and jRCaMP1b are all improved several - fold compared to their parent indicators . jRGECO1a exhibits similar performance to the GCaMP6 indicators . jRCaMP1a and jRCaMP1b are less sensitive , but do not show photo - switching after illumination with blue light , making them suitable for experiments that combine cal - cium imaging and optogenetics . jRCaMP1a and jRCaMP1b are also slightly redder than jRGECO1a . This improved performance will enable a wide range of applications for red GECIs , for example , dual color imaging , where green and red GECIs are used in parallel to study the relation between two components of a neural circuit . Red GECIs will be useful for all - optical neurophysiology experiments , especially when there is spatial overlap between the stimulated and imaged parts of the neural circuit . The large spectral separation between ChR2 activation spectrum and the red GECI excitation spectrum ( Akerboom et al . , 2013 ) is preferable in situations when using a red - shifted light sensitive ion chan - nel and a green GECI produces cross - talk ( Rickgauer et al . , 2014 ; Packer et al . , 2015 ) . The two - photon absorption spectra of red GECIs peak around 1040 nm , which overlaps with the output of cost - effective and powerful fiber lasers . Red GECIs still face challenges . First , all tested red GECIs show smaller ( 3 - to 4 - fold less ) maximal fluorescence changes upon calcium binding than the GCaMP6 indicators . This limits the overall dynamic range of red GECIs . Second , the relatively low absorption cross - section of the red GECIs ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) further reduces the achievable signal - to - noise ratio for in vivo imaging . Third , red GECIs show complex intracellular behavior , such as accumulation in lysosomes ( jRGECO1a ) with long - term expression in the mouse brain . The presence of green fluorescence in all tested GECIs suggests the existence of multiple protein species , some of which do not produce functional signals ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 – 3 ) . These issues seem to be related to the red fluorescent protein component of the sensor ( see , for example , Supplementary file 1 in Cai et al . , 2013 ) . Therefore , engineering red GECIs to produce less non - productive fluorescence might require replacing or re - engineering the RFP itself ( Moore et al . , 2012 ) , a direction that we plan to pursue in the future . Materials and methods All surgical and experimental procedures were in accordance with protocols approved by the HHMI Janelia Research Campus Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Institutional Biosafety Committee . Neuronal culture screen GCaMP indicators are naturally excluded from the nucleus , presumably due to a cryptic nuclear exclusion sequence ( NES ) motif . This gives rise to the characteristic annular labeling . Both RCaMP and R - GECO are expressed throughout the cell , including the nucleus . GECI responses are larger and faster in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus ( unpublished data ) . We therefore included an NES motif to restrict expression to the cytoplasm . For R - CaMP2 , derived from R - CaMP1 . 07 ( Ohkura et al . , 2012 ; Inoue et al . , 2015 ) , it appears that the C - terminal F2A sequence functions as an NES and therefore no additional NES was added . Mutant red GECIs were made using mismatched oligonucleotides and cloned into an expression vector using gene assembly . The expression vector contained a human synapsin - 1 ( SYN1 ) promoter for neuronal - specific expression , a nuclear export signal ( N - terminal MLQNELALKLAGLDINKTG , derived from the cAMP - dependent protein kinase inhibitor alpha subunit ) , a red GECI variant , an internal ribosome entry site , a nuclearly - targeted GFP , and a woodchuck hepatitis virus post - tran - scriptional regulatory element ( WPRE ) to augment expression . Amino acid positions are numbered in jRGECO1 and jRCaMP1 variants ( Supplementary files 1 – 2 ) starting from GGSHHHHHHGMASM . . . ( 1 – 14 . . . ) . NES positions are excluded from the numbering , to correspond with published numbering of the scaffolds . Dana et al . eLife 2016 ; 5 : e12727 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 12727 15 of 24 Tools and Resources Neuroscience Red GECI variants were expressed after transfection by electroporation into rat primary hippo - campal neurons ( P0 ) using the Lonza Nucleofector system ( P3 Primary Cell 96 - well Kit , Lonza , Walkersville , MD ) . Transfected neurons were plated in glass - bottom 96 - well plates ( MatTek , Ashland , MA ) and cultured as described ( Wardill et al . , 2013 ) . For stimulation and imaging , synaptic transmission was inhibited with glutamate and GABA receptor antagonists to make calcium changes solely dependent on opening of voltage sensitive cal - cium channels . APs ( 83 Hz ) were evoked by field stimulation as described ( Wardill et al . , 2013 ) , except that stimulation and imaging was in 96 - well plates with modified electrodes . Illumination was provided by a warm white LED and TxRed ( 7mW at the sample plane , excitation : 540 – 580 nm ; dichroic : 585 nm long - pass ; emission : 593 – 668 nm ) and GFP ( excitation : 450 – 490 nm ; dichroic : 495 nm long - pass ; emission : 500 – 550 nm ) filter sets . Imaging conditions and analysis were similar to prior experiments ( Chen et al . , 2013b ) . For photoswitching measurement in jRGECO1a - expressing neu - rons ( Figure 2—figure supplement 4 ) , we added blue light stimulation ( up to 33 mW ) by using a blue LED and replacing the green excitation filter with a 561 nm shortpass filter ( Semrock , Roches - ter , NY ) . Protein expression and purification Sensors were purified , and calcium titrations were performed as described ( Chen et al . , 2013b ) . Red fluorescence was measured with excitation at 570 nm ( 5 nm bandpass ) and emission 600 nm ( 5 nm bandpass ) . For k off measurements , protein samples in 100 m M calcium were rapidly mixed with a solution of 10 mM EGTA in a stopped - flow device ( Applied Photophysics , UK ) coupled to a fluorom - eter with 560 nm excitation / 580 nm emission filters ( 20 nm bandpass , Varian ) . Solutions were buff - ered with 50 mM MOPS pH 7 . 2 , 100 mM KCl at room temperature . Single exponential curves were fitted to the fluorescence decay . pKa was determined as described ( Chen et al . , 2013b ) . Chromo - phore extinction coefficients ( e apo and e sat ) were measured as described ( Akerboom et al . , 2012 ) . Values are mean ± standard deviation , except where indicated , for independently purified protein samples . Spectroscopy of purified proteins Purified proteins were characterized in 30 mM MOPS , 100 mM KCl , pH 7 . 2 ( calcium calibration buffer C3008MP , ThermoFisher , Waltham , MA ) containing either 10 mM CaEGTA ( calcium buffer ) or 10 mM EGTA ( EGTA buffer ) . Absorption spectra were taken on a UV / VIS spectrometer ( Lambda 35 , PerkinElmer , Waltham , MA ) . Fluorescence emission and excitation spectra were measured on a LS - 55 fluorimeter ( Perkin - Elmer ) with 5 nm slits , and excitation / emission wavelengths of 555 nm / 600 nm . Absolute quantum yields were measured using a Quantaurus - QY integrating - sphere spec - trometer ( model C11374 , Hamamatsu , Japan ) . Dim solutions ( e . g . jRGECO1a or GCaMP6s in EGTA buffer ) were not measurable on the Quantaurus , so relative quantum yields were determined from measured absorption in the UV / VIS spectrometer and integrated fluorescence measured in the fluo - rimeter , in comparison to the reference fluorophores mCherry ( measured absolute QY of 0 . 22 ) or fluorescein ( QY = 0 . 93 in pH 9 . 5 borate buffer ) for either red or green GECIs . Extinction coefficients for RGECO variants were determined using the alkali denaturation method , assuming the denatured extinction coefficient for RGECO variants is the same as denatured mCherry , 37 , 000 M - 1 cm - 1 at 455 nm at pH 13 ( Zhao et al . , 2011 ) . For RCaMP variants , the denatured absorption spectra is compli - cated by an absorbance peak at 383 nm that first appears with increasing pH at pH 11 . 5 , and is irre - versibly formed . So for RCaMP variants we used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( FCS ) , described below , to quantify concentration by counting fluorophores ( Haustein and Schwille , 2003 ) , using mCherry as a concentration reference . FCS was performed on 10 – 100 nM protein solu - tions using 1060 nm excitation at low laser power ( 1 – 3 mW ) to determine the autocorrelation func - tion G ( t ) of the fluorescence signal . The number of fluorophores inside the beam volume is found from 1 / G ( 0 ) . The beam volume was found from identical FCS measurements on the reference protein mCherry at known concentration . For consistency , jRGECO variants were measured using the two methods and results were similar . Dana et al . eLife 2016 ; 5 : e12727 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 12727 16 of 24 Tools and Resources Neuroscience Widefield fluorescence measurement of photoswitching and phoobleaching Measurements were carried out on aqueous droplets of purified protein isolated in octanol ( Kremers et al . , 2009 ) , and sandwiched between two coverslips . We used an epi - illumination micro - scope ( AxioImager , Zeiss , Germany ) with a 20x 0 . 8 NA air objective ( Zeiss ) . For photoswitching experiments co - linear laser excitation was provided to the microscope at 488 nm ( Sapphire 488 , Coherent , Santa Clara , CA ) and 561 nm ( Sapphire 561 , Coherent ) using a beam - combining dichroic , and computer - controlled shutters determined exposure sequence . Fluorescence collected by the objective passed through dichroic and bandpass filters ( Di02 - R561 and 625 / 90 , Semrock ) , and was detected by a fiber - coupled avalanche photodiode ( SPCM - AQRH14 , Pacer , UK ) . Laser power was measured at the output of the objective , and laser beam area in the focal plane was imaged and measured using a CCD camera ( CoolSnap EZ , Photometrics , Tucson , AZ ) , in order to determine the laser intensity . Photobleaching experiments were done with the setup above and either 561 nm laser excitation ( 4 . 2 W / cm 2 at sample ) or Hg - lamp excitation ( 550 / 25 bandpass , Semrock ) yielding 5 . 6 W / cm 2 at the sample . Two - photon spectroscopy Two - photon spectra and FCS were performed as previously described ( Akerboom et al . , 2013 ) . Briefly , protein solutions in coverslip - bottomed dishes were measured on an inverted microscope using a 60x 1 . 2 NA water - immersion objective ( Olympus ) . Near - infrared laser excitation over the range of 700 – 1500 nm was provided by either a Ti : sapphire laser ( Chameleon Ultra II , Coherent ) or an OPO ( Chameleon Compact OPO , Coherent ) . An overlap range 1000 – 1080 nm was used to con - nect the fluorescence spectra generated from the two different excitation sources . The Ti : sapphire beam was long - pass filtered ( 715 / LP , Semrock ) to remove contaminating visible red spontaneous emission emanating from the Ti : sapphire laser cavity . A single dichroic mirror ( 675DCSPXR , Omega , Brattleboro , VT ) was used to bring the Ti : Sapphire or OPO beams to the objective . Fluorescence col - lected from protein samples , filtered by the dichroic mirror and a 720 / SP short - pass and a 625 / 90 bandpass filter ( Semrock ) , was detected by an avalanche photodiode detector ( SPCM _ AQRH - 14 , Excelitas , Waltham MA ) . Output pulses from the detector were fed to an autocorrelator ( Flex03LQ , Correlator . com , Bridgewater , NJ ) , and the system operated under computer control with automated data acquisition . Two - photon action spectra were determined from excitation spectra of 1 micromolar protein sol - utions obtained at low laser power ( 0 . 5 mW ) , and comparing these to spectra measured under iden - tical conditions for the reference dyes fluorescein and rhodamine B , for which we used published 2 - photon cross section data ( Xu and Webb , 1996 ; Makarov et al . , 2008 ) to determine action spectra of the red GECIs . This setup was also used to perform FCS in order to measure chromophore con - centration at low laser power , and two - photon peak brightness ( Mu¨tze et al . , 2012 ) at high laser power . Peak brightness is the experimentally determined maximum rate of fluorescence per mole - cule for a given focusing geometry and is a measure of the brightness and photostability of a fluoro - phore under 2 - photon excitation . To determine peak brightness , 20 – 100 nM solutions of protein in calcium buffer were illuminated at either 1070 nm or 1140 nm at increasing laser power , where at each power setting the mean fluorescence rate F and the mean number of fluorophores N in the laser beam volume were determined by FCS ( Mu¨tze et al . , 2012 ) . The 2 - photon peak brightness was then found from the maximum value of the quantity F / N as the laser power was increased . Two - photon bleaching measurements Two - photon bleaching measurements of green and red GECIs were acquired from isolated aqueous droplets of protein using a resonant - galvo scanning 2 - photon microscope ( MPM - 200 , Thorlabs , Newton , NJ ) . The microscope was equipped with a 40x 1 . 15 NA water immersion objective ( Nikon ) , a primary dichroic ( 680 – 1600 nm longpass filter , Thorlabs ) , and a secondary dichroic ( FF562 - Di03 , Semrock ) with green ( 530 / 43 , Semrock ) and red ( 605 / 70 , Chroma , Bellows Falls , VT ) filters each fol - lowed by GaAsP PMTs ( H7422PA - 40 , Hamamatsu ) . Laser excitation was at 1000 nm or 1070 nm for red GECIs , and 940nm for GCaMP6s . To completely bleach the protein droplets ( thickness , 5 m m ) repetitive z - stacks were taken . Beam scan area was 160 m m x 160 m m , and the scan rate was 8 frames / sec . Light intensity was kept constant across measurements ( Figure 2—figure supplement Dana et al . eLife 2016 ; 5 : e12727 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 12727 17 of 24 Tools and Resources Neuroscience 2 ) . However , due to the use of different wavelengths , the laser spot size , and therefore the intensity profile , was slightly different across these measurements . AAV - mediated GECI expression in mouse V1 neurons Constructs used to produce AAV included pGP - AAV - SYN1 - red GECI - WPRE and the cre - recombi - nase - activated construct pGP - AAV - FLEX - SYN1 - red GECI - WPRE . Virus ( titer : ~ 0 . 7 - 3x10 13 genomes / ml , R - CaMP2 promoter was CaMKII ) was slowly injected ( 25 – 30 nl over 5 min ) through a thinned skull into the primary visual cortex ( 1 – 2 injection sites at variable depths ; 2 . 7 mm lateral and 0 . 2 mm anterior to lambda suture ; 250 m m deep for L2 / 3 imaging , 250 m m and 450 m m for L4 imaging , 500 m m for L5 imaging , and 650 m m and 900 m m for L6 imaging ) . Cranial window implantation Sixteen to 180 days after virus injection , mice were anesthetized using isoflurane ( 3 % for induction , 1 . 5 – 2 % during surgery ) and a 2 – 3 mm circular craniotomy was made above V1 ( centered around the injection site ) . The craniotomy was covered by 1 % agarose ( UltraPure Agarose , ThermoFisher ) . A round 3 mm glass coverslip ( # 1 thickness , Warner Instruments , Hamden , CT ) was cemented to the skull to reduce motion of the exposed brain ( Huber et al . , 2012 ) . A custom titanium head post was fixed to the skull using black dental cement ( Contemporary Ortho - Jet , Land Dental , Wheeling , IL ) . For simultaneous imaging and cell - attached recording , the exposed brain was covered with a thick 1 % agarose layer , and partially covered with a D - shape coverslip . The animal was then placed under a microscope on a warm blanket ( 37 ˚ C ) and kept anesthetized using 0 . 5 % isoflurane and sedated with chlorprothixene ( 20 – 40 m l at 0 . 33 mg / ml , i . m . ) ( Niell and Stryker , 2008 ) . V1 imaging Imaging was performed with a custom - built 2 - photon microscope equipped with a resonant scanner . The light source was an Insight DS Dual 120 femtosecond - pulse laser ( Spectra - Physics , Santa Clara , CA ) running at 1040 nm and 1100 nm for jRGECO1a and jRCaMP1 indicators , respectively . The objective was a 16x 0 . 8 NA water immersion lens ( Nikon , Japan ) . Images were acquired using Scan - Image 5 ( vidriotechnologies . com ) ( Pologruto et al . , 2003 ) . For L2 / 3 , L4 , and L5 imaging , functional images ( 512x512 pixels , 250x250 m m 2 ) were collected at 15 Hz . Typical laser powers were 15 – 60 , 30 – 75 , and 50 – 100 mW at the front aperture of the objective for L2 / 3 , L4 , and L5 imaging , respec - tively . For L6 imaging , functional images ( 512x512 pixels , 165x165 m m 2 or 125x125 m m 2 ) were col - lected at 5 Hz . Laser power was 100 – 150 mW at the front aperture of the objective lens . For dual - color imaging we used green and red detection channels ( 525 / 50 nm and 600 / 60 nm fil - ters respectively , separated by a 565 nm LP dichroic mirror , Chroma ) . Bleedthrough of the red signal into the green channel was negligible , and penetration of green signal into the red channel was cor - rected by linear unmixing . Visual stimuli Moving grating stimuli were generated using the Psychophysics Toolbox ( Brainard , 1997 ; Pelli , 1997 ) in MATLAB ( Mathworks , Natick , MA ) . Each stimulus trial consisted of a 4 s blank period ( uniform gray at mean luminance ) followed by a 4 s drifting sinusoidal grating ( 0 . 05 cycles per degree , 1 Hz temporal frequency ) . Eight drifting directions were used , separated by 45 ˚ , and 5 trials were recorded for each direction , giving a total of 40 stimulus trials per recording session ( 320 s recording time ) . The gratings were presented with an LCD monitor ( 30 x 40 cm ) , placed 25 cm in front of the center of the right eye of the mouse . The monitor subtended an angle of ± 38 ˚ horizon - tally and ± 31 ˚ vertically around the eye of the mouse . For experiments with cell - attached recording ( Figure 4 ) , pipette access required the use of a smaller LCD monitor ( 12 x 16 cm ) placed 10 cm in front of the right eye . During simultaneous imaging and electrophysiology , the optimal grating stim - ulus was repeatedly played , but the contrast of the stimulus grating was adjusted online to record variable spike rates . To minimize stimulus contamination in the red detection channel , a green col - ored plexiglass filter ( 500 – 555 nm FWHM ) was placed in front of the mouse eye . Dana et al . eLife 2016 ; 5 : e12727 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 12727 18 of 24 Tools and Resources Neuroscience Analysis of V1 functional imaging Data from mice expressing GECIs for 16 to 64 days were used for the following analysis ( Figure 3c – f ) . Mechanical drift in the imaging plane was corrected using the TurboReg plug - in in ImageJ ( The´venaz et al . , 1998 ) . All remaining analyses were performed in MATLAB . Regions of interest ( ROIs ) corresponding to identifiable cell bodies were selected using a semi - automated algorithm ( Akerboom et al . , 2012 ; Chen et al . , 2013b ) . Depending on a neuron’s appearance , annular or cir - cular ROIs were placed over the cytosolic region of each cell . The fluorescence time course was mea - sured by averaging all pixels within the ROI , after correction for neuropil contamination ( Kerlin et al . , 2010 ) . The neuropil signal F neuropil ( t ) surrounding each cell was measured by averaging the signal of all pixels within a 20 m m circular region from the cell center ( excluding all somata ) . The fluorescence signal of a cell body was estimated as F cell true ð t Þ ¼ F cell measured ð t Þ (cid:0) r : F neuropil ð t Þ ; with r = 0 . 7 . Neuropil correction was applied only to cells with baseline fluorescence ( F 0 ) signal stron - ger than the surrounding neuropil signal by more than 3 % ; other cells ( approximately 15 – 20 % ) were excluded from the analysis because F 0 could not be reliably estimated . After neuropil correction , the D F / F 0 of each trial was calculated as ( F - F 0 ) / F 0 , where F 0 was averaged over a 1 s period immediately before the start of grating stimulation . Visually responsive neurons were defined as cells with D F / F 0 > 0 . 05 during at least one stimulus period , and using ANOVA across blank and eight direction peri - ods ( p < 0 . 01 ) . We calculated the decay time of fluorescence after the end of the preferred stimulus . For each cell we averaged responses from five trials ; baseline fluorescence and standard deviation were calcu - lated from 1 s before the start of the stimulus . Only cells with fluorescence response peaks with > 4 times the standard deviation of the baseline during the last 1 s of the stimulus were analyzed . The time required for each trace to reach half of its peak value ( baseline fluorescence subtracted ) was calculated by linear interpolation . The same cells were used for plotting the average response showed in Figure 3c . Because each cell responded at slightly different times , depending on its receptive field structure , each trace was shifted to align maxima . For display purposes , traces were smoothed with a 3 sample moving average kernel . The orientation selectivity index ( OSI , Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) was calculated for visually responsive cells ( Niell and Stryker , 2008 ) . First , the preferred orientation ( q pref ) of the cell was determined as the stimulus evoking the greatest response . The orientation tuning curve was con - structed by measuring the mean D F / F 0 , averaged over the stimulus period , for each orientation . We then fitted the tuning curve with the sum of two Gaussians centered on q pref and q pref + p / 2 , both with width s , amplitudes A1 and A2 , and a constant baseline B . The OSI was defined as OSI = ( R pref - R ortho ) / ( R pref + R ortho ) , where R pref and R ortho are the response amplitudes at the preferred ( q pref ) and the orthogonal orientation ( q pref + p / 2 ) respectively . Simultaneous electrophysiology and functional imaging in V1 In vivo cell - attached recordings were performed using glass pipettes ( ~ 7 – 12 M W ) filled with ( in mM ) : 125 NaCl , 5 KCl , 10 glucose , 10 HEPES , 2 CaCl2 , 2 MgSO4 , and 0 . 1 Alexa Fluor 488 ; pH 7 . 4 ) . Signals were amplified using an AxoPatch 200B amplifier ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) , filtered at 5 kHz , and digitized at 10 kHz . Spikes were recorded using current clamp mode . The frame trigger pulses of ScanImage 5 were also recorded and used offline to synchronize individual frames to electrophysiological recordings . After establishment of a low - resistance seal ( 15 – 50 M W ) , the stimu - lus orientation was quickly optimized for individual neurons using recorded spikes . The optimal grat - ing stimulus was repeated with variable contrast to acquire a range of spiking rates . Images ( 512x512 pixels , typically 40x40 m m 2 ) were acquired at 30 Hz and 15 Hz for jRGECO1a and jRCaMP1a , respectively . Ring - shaped ROIs were placed over the cytosolic regions of the cells , and neuropil contamination was subtracted . To quantify the fidelity of single AP detection ( Figure 4e ) , we identified single AP events isolated from other APs by > 1 s , and 2 APs within a time window of 100 and 150 ms for jRGECO1a and jRCaMP1a respectively , isolated from other APs by > 1 s . Noise traces were taken from periods without APs . F 0 values were calculated as the average of 10 frames before the first AP , and peak D F / F 0 was calculated as the maximum of the D F / F 0 trace after the first spike firing , or the maximal D F / F 0 noise value for the noise traces . For d - prime Dana et al . eLife 2016 ; 5 : e12727 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 12727 19 of 24 Tools and Resources Neuroscience calculation and receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curves , response templates for various APs were calculated by averaging response traces . Unit vectors were calculated from the templates by subtracting means and normalizing the vectors . The measured n - AP responses were projected on the unit vectors , where n indicates the number of APs in a time bin , as well as noise traces ( Chen et al . , 2013b ) . The scalar results of projecting the response and noise traces on the unitary response templates were used to calculate d - prime and ROC curves . Time windows in which the APs were fired varied with the number of spikes and the GECI ( jRGE - CO1a : 100 ms for 2APs and increasing by 25 ms for each additional AP , up to 250 ms for 8APs ; jRCaMP1a : 150 ms for 2APs and increasing 50 ms for each additional AP , up to 350 ms for 6 – 8 APs ) . Time bins were chosen to reflect the accumulation of calcium signal for large number of APs ( longer for the slower jRCaMP1a / b , shorter for the faster jRGECO1a ) . Half rise and decay times were calcu - lated from 2 AP responses . Only isolated responses ( without APs > 2 s before the recorded spikes ) were used . An exponential decay curve was fitted to each trace . Only traces with small fitting error were chosen ( 16 traces for both indicators ) . Fixed tissue analysis and immunostaining Mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and transcardially perfused with 10 ml 1X Dulbecco’s phosphate - buffered saline ( DPBS , ThermoFisher ) , followed by 50 ml 4 % paraformaldehyde in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer . After perfusion , the brains were removed and post - fixed overnight at 4 ˚ C . The brains were embedded in 5 % agarose in DPBS , and cut into 50 m m thick coronal sections with a vibratome ( Leica VT 1200S , Germany ) . Because DPBS contains saturating calcium ( 0 . 9 mM ) red GECI brightness is maximal . Sections were coverslipped with Vectashield mounting medium ( H - 1400 , Vec - tor laboratories ) . Confocal images ( LSM 710 , Zeiss ) were collected using a 20x 0 . 8 NA air objective . Emission spectra were characterized using a lambda scanning mode of the confocal microscope , and were corrected for background emission . For LAMP - 1 immunostaining , brains were perfused , fixed ( 4 hr post - fixed , room temperature ) , and sectioned as described above . Sections were soaked and washed twice with DPBS , then blocked in blocking buffer ( 2 % BSA , 0 . 4 % Triton X - 100 in DPBS ) for 1 hr at room temperature . Sections were then incubated in anti - LAMP - 1 antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 ( clone 1D4B , diluted 1 : 200 in blocking buffer , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Dallas , TX ) overnight at 4 ˚ C , and then washed 3 times with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in DPBS , and washed again with DPBS . Finally , sections were mounted and coverslipped with Vectashield anti - fade mounting medium ( H - 1500 , Vector laboratories , Burlingame , CA ) . Drosophila NMJ imaging We made w 1118 ; ; PBac { 20XUAS - IVS - GECI - p10 } VK00005 transgenic flies and crossed them with w 1118 ; ; R57C10 - Gal4 in VK00020 , R57C10 - Gal4 in VK00040 pan - neuronal driver line . Improved expression allows lower excitation light dosage and helps to prevent photobleaching . The NMJ assay is similar to the one used previously ( Chen et al . , 2013b ) . Briefly , actively crawling female 3 rd instar larvae were dissected under minimum illumination intensity . Type Ib boutons on muscle 13 from segment A3 - A5 were wide - field imaged in HL - 6 saline while corresponding axons were electri - cally stimulated with a suction electrode driven by a customized stimulator . Temperature and pH were monitored during imaging . A mercury lamp ( X - CITE exacte , Excelitas ) light source was used for excitation and power of less than 5 mW at the objective front aperture was used . The light intensity was calibrated so that no significant photobleaching was detected during each trial . The filters for jRGECO1 and jRCaMP1 imaging were : excitation : 543 / 22 nm ; dichroic : 562 nm ; emission : 593 / 40 nm . Emitted light was collected on an EMCCD cooled to - 70 ˚ C at 30 fps . Data were analyzed in MATLAB ( MathWorks ) . Zebrafish trigeminal neurons imaging Mitfa (cid:0) / (cid:0) ( nacre ) zebrafish were maintained under standard conditions at 28 ˚ C and a 14 : 10 hr light : dark cycle . Embryos ( 1 – 2 cell stage ) were injected with 20 ng / m l DNA plasmids encoding the red GECI variants under the control of the ( near ) pan - neuronal elavl3 / HuC promoter ( elavl3 : GECI ) , and 40 ng / m l Tol2 transposase mRNA diluted in E3 medium with 0 . 025 % Phenol Red . Three and four day post - fertilization embryos showing expression in isolated trigeminal neurons were treated with 1 Dana et al . eLife 2016 ; 5 : e12727 . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 12727 20 of 24 Tools and Resources Neuroscience mg / ml bath - applied a - bungarotoxin for 30 min to block tail movements . Larvae were mounted side - ways in 1 . 5 % low melting temperature agarose , and imaged using a microscope with a 20 (cid:2) , NA = 1 objective lens ( Olympus , Japan ) and an sCMOS camera ( Hamamatsu Orca Flash 4 ) . Trains of 1 , 5 and 10 field stimuli ( 20 ms each ; 20 Hz ) were applied using two mesh electrodes located inside the bath and a stimulator ( Grass SD9 , Warwick , RI ) . Stimulation voltage was calibrated to elicit an identi - fiable response to a single pulse in GCaMP6f expressing neurons . One spike in a trigeminal neuron has previously been shown to be sufficient to elicit tail movement ( Douglass et al . , 2008 ) . Image acquisition and stimulus control were handled using Hamamatsu HCImage ( 4 . 2 . 5 . 0 ) software . ROIs were selected manually , and data was analyzed using MATLAB ( MathWorks ) . Caenorhabditis elegans ASH and AWC neurons imaging Red GECIs were expressed in the C . elegans ASH and AWC sensory neurons under the sra - 6 and str - 2 promoters , respectively . Animals were restrained in custom - built microfluidic chambers ( Chronis et al . , 2007 ) in S Basal buffer ( Brenner , 1974 ) , and paralyzed with 1 mM tetramisole hydro - chloride ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) during data acquisition to reduce movement . For ASH imag - ing , 1 M glycerol was delivered to the nose of the animal in alternating one second intervals for 4 min as in ( Kato et al . , 2014 ) . For AWC imaging , 92 m M isoamyl alcohol was delivered for one minute after one minute of exposure to buffer . Worms were illuminated with a solid - state lamp ( Lumencor SOLA - LE , Beaverton , OR , 560 / 40 nm excitation filter ) , and fluorescence images ( 630 / 75 nm emission filter ) were collected at 10 fps using a 40x , NA = 1 . 4 objective ( Zeiss ) and an EMCCD camera ( Andor iXon3 , Metamorph Software , 250 x 140 pixels , covering 104 m m x 58 m m ) . Reagent distribution DNA constructs , AAV particles and Drosophila with red GECIs variants were deposited for distribu - tion at Addgene ( http : / / www . addgene . org ) , the University of Pennsylvania Vector Core ( http : / / www . med . upenn . edu / gtp / vectorcore ) and the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center ( http : / / flystocks . bio . indiana . edu ) , respectively .
