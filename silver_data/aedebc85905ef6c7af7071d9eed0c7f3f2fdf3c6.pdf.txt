Accepted : December 4 , 2017 Abstract Plant genomes encode many lineage - speciﬁc , unique transcription factors . Expansion of such gene families has been pre - viously found to coincide with the evolution of morphological complexity , although comparative analyses have been ham - pered by severe sampling bias . Here , we make use of the recently increased availability of plant genomes . We have updated and expanded previous rule sets for domain - based classiﬁcation of transcription associated proteins ( TAPs ) , comprising transcription factors and transcriptional regulators . The genome - wide annotation of these protein families has been ana - lyzed and made available via the novel TAPscan web interface . We ﬁnd that many TAP families previously thought to be speciﬁc for land plants actually evolved in streptophyte ( charophyte ) algae ; 26 out of 36 TAP family gains are inferred to have occurred in the common ancestor of the Streptophyta ( uniting the land plants—Embryophyta—with their closest algal relatives ) . In contrast , expansions of TAP families were found to occur throughout streptophyte evolution . 17 out of 76 expansion events were found to be common to all land plants and thus probably evolved concomitant with the water - to - land - transition . Key words : Charophyta , Streptophyta , Embryophyta , evolution , transcription , land plant . Introduction Transcriptional regulation is carried out by transcription asso - ciated proteins ( TAPs ) , comprising transcription factors ( TFs , binding in sequence - speciﬁc manner to cis - regulatory ele - ments to enhance or repress transcription ) , transcriptional regulators ( TRs , acting as part of the transcription core com - plex , via unspeciﬁc binding , protein – protein interaction or chromatin modiﬁcation ) and putative TAPs ( PTs ) , the role of which needs to be determined ( Richardt et al . 2007 ) . The complexity of transcriptional regulation ( as measured by the genomes’ potential to encode TAPs , i . e . , total number of TAP genes per genome ) coincides with the morphological complexity ( typically measured by number of cell types ) of plants and animals ( Levine and Tjian 2003 ; Lang et al . 2010 ; de Mendoza et al . 2013 ; Lang and Rensing 2015 ) . Comparative studies in plants and animals have revealed gains , losses and expansions of key gene families , and demonstrated the unicellular ancestors of plants and animals had already gained much of the families known as important and typical for these lineages ( Lang et al . 2010 ; de Mendoza et al . 2013 ; de Mendoza et al . 2015 ; Catarino et al . 2016 ) . The recent initial analysis of data from streptophyte algae ( sharing common ancestry with land plants ) suggested that the origin of TAPs considered to be speciﬁc for land plants needs to be revised ( Hori et al . 2014 ; Delaux et al . 2015 ; Wang et al . 2015 ) , which we set out to do here by including more data of streptophyte algae and bryophytes than previ - ously available . Transcription associated proteins , and in particular TFs , are important signaling components and as such often key regu - lators of developmental progressions . They evolve via dupli - cation , paralog retention and subsequent sub - and neofunctionalization ( Rensing 2014 ) , leading to a high abun - dance and combinatorial complexity of these proteins in the (cid:2) The Author ( s ) 2017 .

Evol . 9 ( 12 ) : 3384 – 3397 . doi : 10 . 1093 / gbe / evx258 GBE most complex multicellular lineages ( that perform embryo - genesis ) —namely plants and animals ( de Mendoza et al . 2013 ; Lang and Rensing 2015 ; Rensing 2016 ) . Many plant TFs have initially been described as regulators of organ development or stress responses of ﬂowering plants . However , by broadening the view to other plants it became clear that , for example LFY , initially described in Arabidopsis thaliana as determining the ﬂoral fate of meristems and reg - ulating ﬂower patterning , controls the ﬁrst division of the zy - gote in the moss Physcomitrella patens ( Tanahashi et al . 2005 ) . Also , the ﬂowering plant meristem controlling WOX genes have orthologs in moss that are involved in apical stem cell formation ( Sakakibara et al . 2014 ) . Such homeodomain ( HD ) TFs have deep eukaryotic roots and control important developmental progressions , for example , in embryogenesis , in plants , and animals ( Hudry et al . 2014 ; Catarino et al . 2016 ) . The KNOX and BELL subfamilies of plant HD proteins control mating types of green algae ( Lee et al . 2008 ) and evolved into controlling cell fate determination of ﬂowering plant stem cells ( Hay and Tsiantis 2010 ) . TF gene regulatory network kernels that were present in the earliest land plants are often modiﬁed and coopted during evolution ( Pires et al . 2013 ) , and plant TF paralogs are preferentially retained after whole genome duplication ( WGD ) events ( De Bodt et al . 2005 ; Lang et al . 2010 ) . TRs do not show the same tendency as TFs to expand with complexity , but they are important regulators nevertheless . For example , epigenetic control of important developmental steps like body plan control is main - tained via components of the Polycomb Group ( PcG ) proteins throughout land plants ( Mosquna et al . 2009 ; Okano et al . 2009 ; Bouyer et al . 2011 ) . Transcription associated proteins are thus key to under - standing development and evolution of plant form and func - tion . Access to reliable , up - to - date classiﬁcation of TAPs is important , and enables comparative analyses informing our knowledge of plant transcriptional regulation . In a previous study ( Lang et al . 2010 ) we combined rule sets of three studies ( Riano - Pachon et al . 2007 ; Richardt et al . 2007 ; Guo et al . 2008 ) to generate the comprehensive TAPscan tool , encom - passing sensitive domain - based classiﬁcation rules for 111 TAP families . Similar approaches were undertaken by other studies , for example , PlnTFDB ( Perez - Rodriguez et al . 2010 ) , iTAK ( Zheng et al . 2016 ) , or PlantTFDB ( Jin et al . 2016 ) . We have now expanded our methodology by switching to HMMER v3 , by updating the Hidden Markov Models ( HMM ) of many of the domains , and by including novel sub - family classiﬁcation for several families . Moreover , we have included 92 more genomes than were available 7 years ago , dramatically improving taxon sampling . Here , we present an updated comprehensive analysis of TAP evolution of the green lineage as well as the TAPscan v2 web interface ( http : / / plantco . de / tapscan / ) , including precomputed gene trees . This interface is a successor to PlnTFDB v3 . 0 ( Perez - Rodriguez et al . 2010 ) , encompasses the most comprehensive set of plant TAPs , and represents a novel tool for the plant community to access , screen and download genome - wide TAP annotations . Materials and Methods Data Set In our previous analysis ( Lang et al . 2010 ) no streptophyte algae , no gymnosperms and only a single bryophyte genome were covered . Here , we collected a set of 110 genomes and 13 transcriptomes with the purpose of covering as many ma - jor clades as possible within the Viridiplantae ( green lineage , table 1 and supplementary table S5 , Supplementary Material online ) , and to close the previous taxonomic holes . Upgrade to HMMER3 and New PFAM Proﬁles The extensive update of HMMER from v2 to v3 included improvements in both sensitivity and run time . With this new version , HMMER abandoned its glocal ( global / local ) ap - proach , the alignment of a complete model to a subsection of a protein , to exclusively use local alignments . This change made it possible to make use of how much of the respective HMM proﬁle was matched per alignment . This information was implemented in our TAPscan pipeline as a dynamic cov - erage cutoff aimed to introduce a higher level of strictness to maintain sequence and functional conservation . For our custom - built proﬁles we set this cutoff to 75 % based on manual inspection of the alignments ( cf . Results ) . For the PFAM proﬁles we calculated the proportion of 100 % conser - vation in each proﬁles’ seed alignment and used this as min - imum coverage cutoff ( listed in supplementary table S3 , Supplementary Material online ) . Out of the 124 HMM proﬁles published in 2010 ( Lang et al . 2010 ) , 108 had been obtained from the PFAM database ( PFAM 23 . 0 ) and were again down - loaded directly from the PFAM database ( PFAM 29 . 0 ) . Updating the Custom - Built HMM Proﬁles The 16 domains represented by custom - made proﬁles had to be updated separately . They were ﬁrst checked against the PFAM database to see if any equivalent proﬁles could be found , which was true only for NAC / NAM ( supplementary table S1 , Supplementary Material online ) . To increase the se - quence diversity underlying the HMM proﬁles we decided to not directly reuse the proﬁle multiple sequence alignments published earlier ( Lang et al . 2010 ) , but instead to use the output of these proﬁles when run against a database of 46 genomes representing 12 diverse groups of organisms ( sup - plementary table S2 , Supplementary Material online ; 2x ani - mals , 1x bryophyte , 8x chlorophytes , 1 (cid:2) conifer , 9 (cid:2) dicots , 1 (cid:2) lycophyte , 6 (cid:2) fungi , 1 (cid:2) glaucophyte , 4 (cid:2) monocots , 1 (cid:2) charophyte , 7 (cid:2) protoctista [ 5 (cid:2) nongreen algae , 1 (cid:2) Mycetozoa , 1 (cid:2) Heterolobosea ] , and 5 (cid:2) rhodophytes ) . Genome - wide classiﬁcation in plants GBE Genome Biol . Evol . 9 ( 12 ) : 3384 – 3397 doi : 10 . 1093 / gbe / evx258 3385 To avoid sequences not encompassing the major part of the domain of interest , hit length and model usage had to be at least 75 % of the model length , as mentioned above . For each of the 12 clades four sequences were sampled ( if possible ) , before random sampling collected the remaining sequences to reach 50 sequences . If 50 sequences could not be sampled , due to too few hits in the 2010 ( v1 ) output , all hits were used for building a new model . To measure the variability in the phylogenetically guided sampling approach it was repeated nine times . The detected domains from the chosen sampling run were then aligned using clustalw - 2 . 1 ( Larkin et al . 2007 ) and a new hmm3 model was built using hmmbuild . The new models were run against the same set of 46 genomes and the output scores were plotted ( ﬁg . 1 a ) and compared with the 2010 proﬁle’s ﬁndings ( green in ﬁg . 1 a ) . To remain conserva - tive , the sampling run that generated the proﬁle that had the least amount of previously undetected sequences scoring higher than previously detected ( diamond shaped in ﬁg . 1 a ) was chosen for further processing . Deﬁning the gathering cutoffs ( ga _ cut ) of the proﬁles was done with the help of score - ordered multiple sequence alignments ( ﬁg . 1 b and supplementary ﬁg . S1 , Supplementary Material online ) visual - ized with Jalview v2 . 8 . 2 ( Waterhouse et al . 2009 ) . This made it possible to investigate each proﬁles’ window of uncertainty with the aim to maintain physiochemical properties / conserva - tion above the set ga _ cut ( cf . Results ) . Updating Family Classiﬁcation Rules Using published detailed studies ( see supplementary table S1 , Supplementary Material online and Results for details ) more subfamilies could be distinguished using both PFAM and novel custom proﬁles . By incorporating 9 new PFAM proﬁles and adding 5 new custom proﬁles , 11 additional TAP subfa - milies could be added . This includes an expansion of the Homeodomain ( HD ) family from four to 12 subfamilies , an additional Jumonji subfamily , an additional Polycomb Group ( PcG ) subfamily , and being able to distinguish the MADS sub - class MIKC . If no PFAM proﬁle was available , custom proﬁles were made using existing multiple sequence alignments : BEL ( Hamant and Pautot 2010 ; Sharma et al . 2014b ) , KNOX _ C and PINTOX ( Mukherjee et al . 2009 ) and WOX ( van der Graaff et al .

When screening known PcG _ EZ proteins ( Pu and Sung 2015 ) the prosite CXC pattern ( http : / / prosite . expasy . org / PS51633 ; last accessed December 8 , 2017 ) was found and the underlying alignment used to build a custom model , replacing the SANTA domain ( supplementary table S1 , Supplementary Material online ) . Inference of Ancestral States and Expansions / Contractions / Gains / Losses We modiﬁed the ML phylogeny inferred by ( Wickett et al . 2014 ) and placed our species into the clades included in their study . The tree was then pruned to only contain clades for which we had representative species ( ﬁg . 5 ) . Our data in - cluded representatives of all major clades but hornworts , Magnoliids and Chloranthales , for which no appropriate data was available . This tree served as the basis for the infer - ences outlined below . Averages , fold changes between taxo - nomic groups and q - values ( Mann – Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing ) were calculated in Microsoft Excel ( supplementary table S6 , Supplementary Material online ) . Expansion / contractions and gains / losses were calculated with the count package ( Csuro¨s 2010 ) . Their implementation of ancestral reconstruction by asym - metric Wagner parsimony was used to calculate expansions / contractions and their implementation of PGL ( propensity for gene loss ) was used to calculate gains / losses , both with de - fault settings . All detected changes are shown in supplemen - tary table S7 , Supplementary Material online . The count predictions were entered into supplementary table S6 , Supplementary Material online ( tab Groups , column O - R ) and manually reviewed ; changes detected in ( mainly ) tran - scriptomic data / lineages with a low number of samples were disregarded , since they have a high chance of being due to incomplete data . Reviewed gains / losses / expansions / contractions were imposed onto the tree ( ﬁg . 5 ) . Phylogenetic Inference The multiple sequence alignment of the DUF 632 / PLZ family case study was calculated using muscle v3 . 8 . 31 ( Edgar 2004 ) and visualized with Jalview v2 . 9 . 0b2 . Sequences representing < 50 % of the alignment columns were removed and align - ment columns with high entropy and low alignment quality as calculated by Jalview ( Waterhouse et al . 2009 ) were manually clipped before Bayesian inference ( BI ) with MrBayes v3 . 2 . 5 x64 ( Ronquist et al . 2012 ) . The appropriate prior model was selected based on AIC / BIC using Prottest v3 . 4 . 2 ( Darriba et al . 2011 ) and turned out to be JTT þ G þ F . BI was run with two hot and two cold chains until the standard deviation of split frequencies dropped < 0 . 01 at 756 , 600 generations , 200 trees were discarded as burn - in . The tree was visualized using FigTree v1 . 4 . 3pre ( http : / / tree . bio . ed . ac . uk / software / ﬁgtree / ; last accessed December 8 , 2017 ) . For the gene trees shown in the TAPscan interface , we used several alignment tools as follows . Phylogenetic trees were generated for all TAPs appearing in more than one spe - cies of Archeaplastida . The protein sequences were down - loaded using the TAPscan web interface and alignments were generated using MAFFT v7 . 310 ( Katoh and Standley 2013 ) . Alignments containing up to 500 input sequences were generated using MAFFT - linsi and MAFFT - fftnsi , whereas bigger alignments were generated only by MAFFT - fftnsi . The alignments were trimmed using two trimAl ( Capella - Gutierrez et al . 2009 ) runs , one for trimming the alignments using the “ - automated1” parameter and one for removing fragmen - tary sequences ( “ - resoverlap 0 . 75 - seqoverlap 50” ) . The trimmed mafft alignment was selected for inference if it was at least 100 columns long . If both linsi and fftnsi align - ment were present and featured > 100 columns , the longer one was selected . If no suitable alignment could be generated , muscle v3 . 8 . 31 was run with two iterations and trimal applied . If that did not lead to a suitable trimmed alignment , ProbCons v1 . 12 ( Do et al . 2005 ) was applied for alignments of up to 2 , 100 input sequences . If that failed as well , muscle was applied with 16 iterations . In cases where trimAl pro - duced empty / too short alignments , the automated trimming step was omitted . If all trimmed alignments were too short , the shortest untrimmed alignment was selected . Alignments were formatted to Stockholm format using sreformat from the HMMer package . For neighbor - joining ( NJ ) tree inference , quicktree - SD ( Frickenhaus and Beszteri 2008 ) was used applying using 100 bootstrap iterations . We used NJ inference due to the large to very large size of most of the gene families ; in future trees generated with other methods of inference will be added . For visualization , the trees were formatted from Newick format to PhyloXML using the phyloxml ( Han and Zmasek 2009 ) converter provided by the forester package ( https : / / sites . google . com / site / cmzmasek / home / software / forester ; last accessed December 8 , 2017 ) . The trees are presented on the TAPscan webpage using Archaeopteryx . js ( https : / / sites . google . com / site / cmzmasek / home / software / archaeopteryx - js ; last accessed December 8 , 2017 ) . Visualization of Family Proﬁles and Column Charts Using the R environment ( R _ Core _ Team 2016 ) the family per species data ( supplementary table S6 , Supplementary Material online ) was ﬁrst log2 transformed and then hierar - chically clustered on the x axis using complete linkage with euclidean distances to generate TAP clusters , and visualized as a heatmap using R gplots v3 . 0 . 1 ( https : / / cran . r - project . org / web / packages / gplots / index . html ; last accessed December 8 , 2017 ) . The y axis was ordered to follow our adaption of the ( Wickett et al . 2014 ) phylogeny ( ﬁg . 5 ) . The family per species data was also used to create stacked column charts Wilhelmsson et al . GBE 3388 Genome Biol . Evol . 9 ( 12 ) : 3384 – 3397 doi : 10 . 1093 / gbe / evx258 ( supplementary ﬁgs . S3 and S4 , Supplementary Material on - line ) . Each TAP value was log2 transformed and then grouped by either TAP - class ( supplementary ﬁg . S3 , Supplementary Material online ) or amount of multiple domain TAPs ( supple - mentary ﬁg . S4 , Supplementary Material online ) , maintaining the species separation . Implementation of the TAPscan Online Resource The web page was setup using a LAMP architecture ( Lawton 2005 ) implemented with Linux Debian 9 . 1 , Apache 2 . 4 . 25 ( Debian ) , MariaDB 10 . 1 . 26 and PHP 7 . 0 . 19 - 1 . PHP addition - ally uses HTML5 , CSS3 , Javascript and jQuery v3 . 1 . 1 for dy - namic web page creation . The data used for the web page is saved as 18 tables which are normalized to avoid redundancy of the data . For example , there are ﬁve tables storing taxon - omy information for the species table and two tables storing the domain rules for the domain and TAP family table . Access to the database is provided using PHP which also generates the HTML code sent to the user . The databases’ entity rela - tionship model is visualized in supplementary ﬁgure S7 , Supplementary Material online . The gene trees and the un - derlying alignments ( see above ) were made available on the TAP family view pages for viewing and download . Results and Discussion Availability of accurate and state - of - the - art genome - wide TAP annotation is considered to be of high value , in particular for the plant science community . TAPscan v2 presents a frame - work for comparative studies of TAP function and evolution . The availability of new software tools , protein domain circum - scriptions , and plant genomes triggered the updating of our previous rule sets and resources , and allowed to draw novel important conclusions on plant TAP evolution . TAPscan v2 Uses More and Better Proﬁles TAPscan relies on HMMs to detect domains . We updated our approach from using HMMER2 to its accelerated successor HMMER3 ( http : / / hmmer . org / ; last accessed December 8 , 2017 ) , making use of the novel local alignment of HMMs to deﬁne better coverage cutoffs . Moreover , we updated all used PFAM ( Finn et al . 2016 ) proﬁles from version 23 . 0 to 29 . 0 and included nine new PFAM proﬁles ( supplementary table S1 , Supplementary Material online , columns “Additional Proﬁles” in the rule change tabs ) . Eight of those were added due to our novel diversiﬁed classiﬁcation rules , and one previous custom proﬁle , NAC _ plant , was replaced with the now available PFAM proﬁle NAM ( supplementary table S1 , Supplementary Material online ) . Among the updated PFAM HMMs , seven were renamed and two merged into other existing domain models . Out of nine name changes that occurred due to the PFAM updates , ﬁve affected domains of ( previously ) unknown function ( supplementary table S1 , Supplementary Material on - line , tab “name change” ) . We also added / exchanged ﬁve new custom - built proﬁles ( BEL , KNOXC , PINTOX , WOX _ HD , and CXC ; cf . Methods ) due to our expanded classiﬁcation rules ( supplementary table S1 , Supplementary Material online , rule change tabs HD and PcG ) . All custom HMMs were updated using a phylogenetic sampling approach . For that , previously used HMMs ( Lang et al . 2010 ) were run against a database of 46 genomes with broad phylogenetic sampling ( supplementary table S2 , Supplementary Material online ) . Using the 2010 ( v1 ) proﬁles , hit sequences were sampled from each of the 12 groups that the 46 genomes represent , and then used to rebuild each custom HMM . The resulting HMMs were run against the same set of 46 genomes , and the outputs were compared to determine how previously undetected sequences scored now ( ﬁg . 1a ) . By manual inspection of all aligned hit sequen - ces we deﬁned the individual score cutoffs to lie above sequences of uncertain functional conservation ( ﬁg . 1 b and supplementary ﬁg . S1 , Supplementary Material online ) . In or - der to represent a functionally relevant hit , the major part of the HMM should be detected . Based on manual inspection of all custom proﬁle alignments we decided to employ a global cutoff of 75 % HMM used ( ﬁg . 1 b and supplementary ﬁg . S1 , Supplementary Material online ) . Improved Taxon Sampling , Subfamily Deﬁnition , and Speciﬁcity In the past 7 years , a multitude of plant and algal genome sequences became available , allowing for a much better taxon sampling . There are now 82 more plant genomes in - cluded in TAPscan v2 , and nine more algal genomes , bringing the total up to 110 ( table 1 ) . To improve taxonomic resolution we also included a selection of 13 transcriptomes , reaching a ﬁnal set of 123 species . We have also included 11 genomes and 1 transcriptomes that are not yet published . Data for those will be quickly made available via the web interface as soon as they are publicly available . For example , PlantTFDB v4 ( Jin et al . 2016 ) includes more angiosperm genomes , we took care to include as much as possible nonseed plants and strep - tophyte algae , to be able to take a close look at the early evolution of plant TAPs . In addition to the Viridiplantae that are the focus of this study , we have included Rhodophyta and the glaucophyte alga Cyanophora paradoxa as outgroup rep - resentatives within the Archaeplastida ( supplementary table S5 / S6 , Supplementary Material online ) . To update our classiﬁcation rules ( supplementary table S3 , Supplementary Material online ) , we screened the literature for novel ( sub ) classiﬁcations of TAPs and checked them for ap - plicability to our domain - based classiﬁcation scheme . In total , 11 new subfamily classiﬁcation rules were established , and some families renamed due to changes in domain or family names ( ﬁg . 2 ) . In particular , we subdivided homeodomain Genome - wide classiﬁcation in plants GBE Genome Biol .

The name of each family or subfamily is shown on top of each classiﬁcation rule set ; novel ( in v2 ) rule sets are shown in bold face . TF ( green ) , TR ( orange ) , and PT ( yellow ) are marked by different symbols and in the same color code that is used throughout the manuscript . Required ( “should” ) domains ( represented by corresponding HMMs ) are connected to the family symbol by lines ; forbidden ( “should not” ) domains are connected via dotted red lines . Similar domains that are selected via the best hit are shown with red dotted double arrows on grey background , if one out of two domains are required this is denoted as a blue box with two required lines . Custom domains are depicted as purple circles , PFAM domains as blue circles . For brevity , the homeobox should rule for all HD _ families was omitted .

Also , MADS - box TFs were divided into general and MIKC - type ( Gramzow and Theissen 2010 ) , Jumonji into PKDM7 and other ( Qian et al . 2015 ) , and the Polycomb Group ( PcG ) TR MSI was added ( supplementary table S1 , Supplementary Material online ) . Similar to ( Zheng et al . 2016 ) we reclassiﬁed mTERF , Sigma70 - like , FHA and TAZ as TR instead of TF ; TAPs containing the DDT domain are subdivided into the TR DDT and the TF HD _ DDT in TAPscan v2 . With a total of 124 fam - ilies and subfamilies ( supplementary table S3 , Supplementary Material online , ﬁg . 2 ; 81 of them TFs ) our rule set is the most comprehensive one for plant TAPs , since other approaches have signiﬁcantly less resolution , for example , 58 in PlantTFDB 4 . 0 ( Jin et al . 2016 ) and 72 in iTAK ( Zheng et al . 2016 ) . We compared the TAPscan v1 and v2 annotations with a number of A . thaliana and P . patens phylogeny - based family classiﬁcations deﬁned as gold standard ( Mosquna et al . 2009 ; Mukherjee et al . 2009 ; Paponov et al . 2009 ; Martin - Trillo and Cubas 2010 ) . We ﬁnd that the average sensitivity of TAPscan v2 ( 87 . 76 % ) is only slightly lower than of v1 ( 89 . 31 % ) , whereas the speciﬁcity of v2 ( 100 . 00 % ) is much higher than in the old version ( 92 . 31 % ; supplementary table S4 , Supplementary Material online ) . The combined sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the new version is therefore 6 . 1 % improved . It should be noted that the comparatively low sensitivity for some of the HD sub classes is balanced by the fact that all HD family members are detected as such , yet in cases where do - main scores are below cutoffs are sometimes binned into HD _ other . The weighted sensitivity , taking into account gene family sizes , is strongly improved to 87 . 03 % as com - pared with 78 . 27 % in ( Lang et al . 2010 ) . The TAPscan Online Resource In order to make the domain - based classiﬁcation available to the scientiﬁc community in an easy to use way , we imple - mented a web - based resource that allows a user to browse the data either in a species - centric or a TAP family - centric view ( http : / / plantco . de / tapscan / ) . The interface ( ﬁg . 3 ) includes taxonomic information as expandable trees and an intuitive click - system for selection of sequences of interest that can subsequently be downloaded in annotated FASTA format . TAPscan FASTA headers contain the species , TAP family infor - mation and domain positions . It is possible to either download all proteins of a custom set of species containing a speciﬁc TAP , or to download all proteins for a speciﬁc family and species . The latter makes it possible to download isoforms , if available . The TAP overview pages show the domain rules a protein has to meet in order to be classiﬁed as belonging to that family . Domain names are linked to PFAM entries or custom domain alignments and HMM proﬁles . Locations of domains within the sequence are shown in sequence view . Precomputed phylogenies ( gene trees ) are available for view - ing and download on the overview pages . These trees are intended as a ﬁrst glimpse , allowing users to quickly access gene relationships without having to infer a tree on their own . In the case of not yet published sequence data ( table 1 ) a disclaimer is shown , mentioning that the data will be made available immediately upon publication . Such unpublished in - formation is excluded from species or protein counts in the web interface . By including these data into the interface we are able to quickly release TAP annotation for these genomes as soon as the data become public . Taxonomic Proﬁling of TAPs Heatmap representation of the data shows that TAP family size generally increased during land plant evolution ( ﬁg . 4 and see supplementary ﬁg . S2 , Supplementary Material online for expanded version ) . Cluster 5 contains families ( such as bZIP , bHLH , or MYB ) that were already abundant in the algal rela - tives of land plants , whereas cluster 3 contains TAPs that ex - panded in land plants and again in seed plants , such as NAC or ABI3 / VP1 . The intervening cluster 4 contains families that show high abundance throughout , like HD or RWP - RK . The biggest cluster ( 1 ) contains families that show either only gradual expansion from algae ( bottom of ﬁgure ) to ﬂowering plants ( top of ﬁgure ) , or no expansion at all . Consequently , cluster 1 contains many TRs , which have previously shown not to be subject to as much expansion as TFs ( Lang et al . 2010 ) . The small cluster 2 next to cluster 1 harbors families of spu - rious presence , like those that evolved in vascular plants ( Tracheophyta ; like NZZ or ULT ) . In general , the heatmap vis - ualizes a principal gain of ( primarily ) TF paralogs within exist - ing families concomitant with the terrestrialization of plants ( cf . supplementary ﬁg . S3 , Supplementary Material online ) . Interestingly , the propensity of TAPs to comprise of more than one functional domain increases in a very similar pattern ( supplementary ﬁg . S4 , Supplementary Material online ) , akin to the domain combination tendency generally seen for plants ( Kersting et al . 2012 ) . Hence , the combinatorial potential of TFs clearly coincides with increasing morphological complexity ( as measured by number of cell types ) , corroborating earlier results ( Lang et al . 2010 ; Lang and Rensing 2015 ) . TAP Family Evolution The taxonomic sampling of our data is visualized as a cartoon tree ( ﬁg . 5 ) derived from a recent phylogenomics study ( Wickett et al . 2014 ) . We plotted the gains , losses , expansions and contractions of TAP families onto this tree to enable a global view of plant TAP evolution ( cf . supplementary table Genome - wide classiﬁcation in plants GBE Genome Biol . Evol . 9 ( 12 ) : 3384 – 3397 doi : 10 . 1093 / gbe / evx258 3391 S6 / S7 , Supplementary Material online ) . 32 losses were pre - dicted that are scattered along the tree . The streptophyte alga Klebsormidium nitens apparently secondarily lost ﬁve TAP families , whereas the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorfﬁi lost eight . Another eight families were lost during gymno - sperm evolution , one of them ( HD _ Pintox ) being absent from all studied gymnosperms , whereas two are lacking in conifers and ﬁve in Ginkgo ( e . g . , LFY—although a lacking gene model would be an alternative explanation ) . A total of 76 expansions were detected , of which the highest number ( 17 . 22 % ) are inferred to have occurred in the lineage that led to the last common ancestor of all land plants . All other expansions show a scattered distribution along the deep as well as distal nodes of the tree ( ﬁg . 5 ) . The 13 inferred family contractions also display a patchy pattern . Strikingly , out of 36 TAP family gains 26 are predicted to have occurred in strep - tophyte algae ( nodes 34 - 30 ) . Another ﬁve are synapomorphic of land plants ( Embryophyta ) , whereas only 2 , 1 , and 1 are evolutionary novelties of vascular plants , Euphyllophyta , and Eudicots , respectively . Many TAP Families Were Gained in the Water Previously , due to limited taxon sampling , many plant - speciﬁc TAPs were inferred to have been gained at the time of the water - to - land - transition of plant life ( Lang et al . 2010 ) . Streptophyte algae are sister to land plants and thus ideally suited , together with bryophyte sequences , to elucidate whether gains occurred prior or after terrestrialization . Although only two genomes of strepptophyte algae have yet been published ( Hori et al . 2014 ; Delaux et al . 2015 ) , there are transcriptome data available for seven species ( Timme et al . 2012 ) that were included into TAPscan ( table 1 and supplementary table S5 / S6 , Supplementary Material online ) . Similarly , although no other bryophyte genomes than P . patens are published yet , we included transcriptomes of the mosses Ceratodon purpureus ( Szovenyi et al . 2015 ) and Funaria hygrometrica ( Szovenyi et al . 2011 ) , and of the liver - wort Marchantia polymoprha ( Sharma et al . 2014a ) .

Genome - wide classiﬁcation in plants GBE Genome Biol . Evol . 9 ( 12 ) : 3384 – 3397 doi : 10 . 1093 / gbe / evx258 3393 could be conﬁrmed . Of the others , three ( ARF , S1Fa - like , and O - FucT ) are already present in Rhodophyta , Chlorophyta , or both . Strikingly , the vast majority of these 20 families ( 15 ) are present in Charophyta ( comprising all lineages of streptophyte algae ) , but not Chlorophyta or Rhodophyta ( supplementary table S6 , Supplementary Material online ) . Hence , they were most probably gained during the evolution of the Streptophyta ( uniting the Charophyta with the land plants ) . Out of these 15 families , 11 are already present in the KCM grade ( encompassing Klebsormidiales , Chlorokybales , and Mesostigmatales and sister to the ZCC grade and land plants ) , whereas 4 ( Aux / IAA , DUF632 domain containing , GRAS and HRT ) are present only in the ZCC grade ( encompassing Zygnematales , Coleochaetales , and Charales , together with the land plants comprising the Phragmoplastophyta ) . This ﬁnding is in line with the emerging evidence that in particular ZCC species share many unique features with land plants like polyplastidy ( de Vries et al . 2016 ) or the phragmoplast ( Pickett - Heaps et al . 1999 ; Buschmann and Zachgo 2016 ) , and that Klebsormidium also possesses some “plant - like” fea - tures , like callose and the phenylpropanoid pathway ( Herburger and Holzinger 2015 ; de Vries et al . 2017 ) . Based on our ﬁndings , the last common ancestor of streptophytes had already evolved 11 TAP families previously thought to be land plant - speciﬁc , and the last common ancestor of Phragmoplastophyta ( ZCC grade algae and land plants ) an - other ﬁve families . Prominent examples of these families are the TF families LFY and NAC ( present already in K . nitens ) , as well as GRAS and Aux / IAA ( present in the ZCC grade ) . Most of what we know about function of these TF families stems from research in ﬂowering plants , and many of them control development of organs unique to ﬂowering plants . It will therefore be intriguing to determine the putative ancestral function of these genes in the last common ancestor of strep - tophytes . As an example , a recent study showed that a P . patens TCP TF is involved in suppressing branching of the moss sporophyte ( which is determinate since it does not branch ) ( Ortiz - Ramirez et al . 2016 ) . Origin and Expansion Revisited Several of the gains previously inferred to have occurred in vascular plants , angiosperms or eudicotelydons can now be dated back to the common ancestors with streptophyte al - gae , bryophytes , ferns or lycophytes ( ﬁg . 5 and supplemen - tary table S6 / S7 , Supplementary Material online ) . Together with the families mentioned in the last paragraph , a total of 35 TAP families ( most of them TFs ) evolved at some point in the Archaeplastida , before the evolution of angiosperms , shifting the inferred gain dates back in time . Yet , out of 44 TAP families previously inferred to be expanded in land plants as compared with algae ( Lang et al . 2010 ) , 21 show a > 2 - fold increase in the data presented here , and all 44 signiﬁcantly more members ( q < 0 . 05 , Mann – Whitney ) in land plants than in algae ( supplementary table S6 , Supplementary Material on - line ) . These data suggest a primary burst of gain and expan - sion of TAPs concomitant with the origin of Streptophyta . The total numbers of TAPs , and in particular TFs , show a clear increase in the common ancestor of land plants , but also in some streptophyte algae ( supplementary ﬁg . S3 , Supplementary Material online ) . We expect that with more genomes of streptophyte algae becoming available the gain and expansion of even more families will be inferred to have occurred at earlier time points . Of 22 families previously inferred to have been expanded in angiosperms ( Lang et al . 2010 ) , the present data support 17 with a 2 - fold change and 15 based on statistical testing ( over - lap 13 ; q < 0 . 05 ; supplementary table S6 , Supplementary Material online ) . Six TAP families expanded at the basis of angiosperms ( among them HD _ KNOX2 ) , and several families expanded subsequently ( ﬁg . 5 ) . The subfunctionalization of such TAPs might be related to the more complex reproductive system of angiosperms . While most TF were already present in the earliest land plants , DBP and SAP appear ﬁrst in vascular plants , ULT in the common ancestor of ferns and seed plants , and NZZ is unique to eudicots . One of the major gaps in the previous sampling , be - sides the streptophyte algae , were gymnosperms . We have now included three conifers and Ginkgo biloba . If we consider the inferred expansions based on the tree ( ﬁg . 5 ) , a total of 13 expansions occur between the land plant node ( 29 ) and the angiosperms ( 25 ) . Four TF families ( BBR / BPC , CCAAT _ HAP2 , CCAAT _ HAP3 , and GeBP ) were apparently expanded in the Euphyllophyta ( ferns and seed plants , node 27 ) , another three ( HD _ BEL , Pseudo ARR - B , and Whirly ) in the seed plants . All these TF families are thus presumably important for spermatophyte evolution and development . In a recent study ( Catarino et al . 2016 ) , the authors had analyzed 48 plant TF families based on PlantTFDB classiﬁca - tion rules ( Jin et al . 2014 ) in 15 species . In general , their in - ference of TF family gain is consistent with our data : of 38 families that can be compared , 30 are placed at the same node . For the remaining eight , our study places six at earlier nodes of the tree , probably due to better taxon sampling . The study also did a subfamily analysis of HD TFs and concluded that almost all were already present in algae . In our study , we ﬁnd that of 12 HD subfamilies all but two ( HD _ BEL and HD _ KNOX2 ) are detected in algae . We also compared gain of 40 TF families from ( Jin et al . 2016 ) with our data and can conﬁrm their ﬁndings for 27 families . Out of the remaining 13 , we detect 10 at earlier nodes in the tree , 4 of them in ZCC grade streptophyte algae instead of bryophytes , suggesting again that due to better sampling we infer family evolution more accurately . The M . polymorpha genome was published ( Bowman et al . 2017 ) during the time this manuscript was under review . We have hence activated the previously com - puted data in the web interface and have added Wilhelmsson et al . GBE 3394 Genome Biol . Evol . 9 ( 12 ) : 3384 – 3397 doi : 10 . 1093 / gbe / evx258 corresponding columns to supplementary table S6 , Supplementary Material online ; the comparison of the tran - scriptomic and genomic data does not show any severe differ - ences . The genome publication included an analysis of TFs that we compared with our data ( supplementary table S6 , Supplementary Material online ) . We detect 400 TFs , Bowman et al . 387 TFs ; 33 out of 40 families are consistent ; in the remaining seven cases the node of predicted origin varies due to different sampling . Employing TAPscan Data As an example on how the data presented with this study can be used , we selected the putative TAP family “DUF 632 do - main containing . ” This domain of unknown function ( http : / / pfam . xfam . org / family / PF04782 ; last accessed December 8 , 2017 ) is described as representing a potential leucine zipper , which is why it was initially deﬁned as a putative TAP , PT ( Richardt et al . 2007 ) . Our data show that this family ﬁrst appears in the common ancestor of Coleochaetales , Zygnematales , and land plants ( node 31 ) and is present throughout land plants ( supplementary table S6 , Supplementary Material online , and ﬁg . 5 ) . There are on av - erage 19 family members in angiosperms , 7 in gymnosperms , 6 in bryophytes , and 3 in the streptophyte alga Coleochaete orbicularis . DUF 632 is part of cluster 3 ( ﬁg . 4 ) that shows expansion during land plant evolution . It is not detected to be expanded using Wagner parsimony ( ﬁg . 5 ) , but shows signif - icant size increase ( q < 0 . 05 , Mann – Whitney ; supplementary table S6 , Supplementary Material online ) between nonseed plants and seed plants ( fold change 2 . 95 ) . We selected protein sequences of this family using the TAPscan interface “family view” option , thus representing several angiosperm lineages as well as gymnosperms and non - seed plants . An alignment of the sequences ( supplementary ﬁg . S5 , Supplementary Material online ) shows several highly conserved blocks , all of which feature positively charged as well as regularly spaced Leucine residues , reinforcing the no - tion of a potential DNA - binding Leucine zipper . Given the proposed structure we suggest to call this family Plant Leucine Zipper ( PLZ ) TFs . Phylogenetic inference shows that all nonseed plant sequences are present in the same subclade ( supplementary ﬁg . S6 , Supplementary Material online ; the same can be derived from the tree automatically inferred and available via the TAPscan web interface ) , this subclade is sister to approximately half of the seed plant sequences . Based on the structure of the tree , duplication and paralog retention occurred several times during seed plant evolution . Most of the paralogs were already established in the lineage leading to the last common ancestor of seed plants , whereas some dupli - cations occurred only in angiosperms . In order to understand under which conditions members of this protein family are active , we conducted expression pro - ﬁling using existing data for P . patens and A . thaliana ( Hruz et al . 2008 ; Hiss et al . 2014 , 2017 , phytozome . org ) . Out of ﬁve P . patens genes detected by TAPscan , one appears to be a truncated pseudogene that was removed during align - ment curation ; another two genes are barely expressed . The remaining two genes ( Pp3c16 _ 15000V3 . 1 and Pp3c27 _ 2840V3 . 1 ) , however , show discrete expression pro - ﬁles . The expression of both genes is higher under diurnal light and ammonia application . Pp3c16 _ 15000V3 . 1 is more highly expressed upon heat stress , darkness and UV - B treat - ment , as well as in mature sporophytes and under biotic stim - ulus . Pp3c27 _ 2840V3 . 1 is less expressed in gametophores ( representing the late vegetative phase ) as well as in mature sporophytes ( i . e . , adversely to the other gene ) . Similarly , ABA treatment leads to lower expression of Pp3c16 _ 15000V3 . 1 and higher expression of Pp3c27 _ 2840V3 . 1 . The two A . thali - ana genes most closely related to the nonseed plant clade , AT5G25590 . 1 and AT1G52320 . 2 , show no particularly strong expression in any tissue or developmental stage , how - ever , other members of the family show peaks in , for exam - ple , reproductive structures , xylem , or seed . AT1G52320 . 2 is induced , for example , under germination , drought and ABA , whereas AT5G25590 . 1 shows higher expression , for exam - ple , under UV - B , biotic stimulus , elevated CO 2 and drought . In summary , members of the streptophyte - speciﬁc PLZ family appear to be differentially regulated under a range of abiotic and biotic stimuli as well as in different development stages . Such an expression proﬁle ﬁts that of a TF family undergoing paralog retention followed by sub and neofunctionalization of expression domains ( Birchler and Veitia 2010 ; Rensing 2014 ) . Outlook Previous studies of land plant TAP evolution , like ( Lang et al . 2010 ) , suffered from severe sampling bias , leading to many gains and expansions being either associated with the water to land transition ( because they were inferred to have oc - curred between green algae and the moss P . patens ) , or the angiosperm radiation ( since they occurred between the lyco - pyhte S . moellendorfﬁi and angiosperms ) . Using better sam - pling , including streptophyte algae , more bryophytes , a fern and gymnosperms , we can now more accurately trace Viridiplantae TAP gains and expansions . Although we expect that we will have to again adjust our current understanding as more genomes become available , we can now say that much of what we considered to be speciﬁc for land plants or ﬂower - ing plants already evolved in the water , in streptophyte algae , or in the course of preﬂowering land plant evolution . The results of our improved genome - wide TAP annotation methodology , including annotated fasta ﬁles and gene trees , are now available online via an easy - to - use web interface . Species already sequenced but not yet published have already been included and will be made available immediately after publication . We trust that TAPscan v2 will be an important community resource for plant TAP analyses . Genome - wide classiﬁcation in plants GBE Genome Biol .
