Thus , the possibility exists for sharing common regulatory elements contained in the spacer region responsible for transcriptional activation and reg - ulation of the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes . In the present study , a reporter gene construct containing (cid:1) 22 . 4 kb of the 5 (cid:2) - flank - ing region of the CYP1A2 gene was found to support (cid:1) - naph - thoflavone ( BNF ) and 3 - methylchoranthrene ( 3 - MC ) - mediated transcriptional activation . The responsive region was also func - tional in directing activation of the CYP1A1 promoter , indicating that the region works bidirectionally to govern transcriptional activation of both CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 . To simultaneously evaluate transcriptional activation of both genes , a dual re - porter vector was developed in which the spacer region was inserted between two different reporter genes , firefly luciferase and secreted alkaline phosphatase . Transient transfection of the dual reporter vector in HepG2 cells revealed increases in both reporter activities after exposure of the cells to BNF and 3 - MC . Deletion studies of the spacer region indicated that a region from (cid:1) 464 to (cid:1) 1829 of the CYP1A1 gene works bidi - rectionally to enhance the transcriptional activation of not only CYP1A1 but also CYP1A2 . In addition , a negative bidirectional regulatory region was found to exist from (cid:1) 18 , 989 to (cid:1) 21 , 992 of the CYP1A1 gene . These data established that induction of human CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 is simultaneously controlled through bidirectional and common regulatory elements . The potential for induction is a typical property of many cytochromes P450 involved in the oxidative metabolism of drugs , environmental chemicals , and endogenous compounds ( Denison and Whitlock , 1995 ) . Treatment of experimental animals and humans with chemicals such as 2 , 3 , 7 , 8 - tetra - chlorodibenzo - p - dioxin ( TCDD ) , (cid:1) - naphthoflavone ( BNF ) , or 3 - methylchorantherene ( 3 - MC ) is known to enhance expres - sion of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 ( Nebert and Gonzalez , 1987 ) . Most of these compounds increase transcription of both the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes via activation of the aryl hydro - carbon receptor ( AHR ) . Regulatory cis - elements mediating AHR activation of the CYP1A1 gene have been extensively studied , whereas those associated with regulation of the CYP1A2 gene are limited . As for the transcriptional activation of CYP1A1 , chemicals such as TCDD and 3 - MC are shown to bind to AHR , followed by translocation into the nucleus ( Whitlock , 1999 ) . In the nucleus , AHR dimerizes with AHR nuclear translocator ( ARNT ) and interacts with xenobiotic - responsive element ( XRE ) ( 5 (cid:2) - TNGCGTG - 3 (cid:2) ) in the 5 (cid:2) - flanking region of the CYP1A1 gene to activate transcription ( Hankinson , 1995 ) . Several XREs were identified in the 5 (cid:2) - flanking region of the This work was supported by Grant - in - Aid from the Ministry of Education , Sciences and Culture ( Ministry of Education , Culture , Sports , Sciences and Technology ) , the Ministry of Health and Welfare ( Ministry of Health , Labor , and Welfare ) of Japan , and Comprehensive Research and Education Center for Planning of Drug Development and Clinical Evaluation , Tohoku University 21st Century “Center of Excellence” Program .

Some of them interact with the AHR complex and mediate 3 - MC activation of the CYP1A1 ( Kub - ota et al . , 1991 ) . Based on these results , reporter gene assay systems for the assessment of human CYP1A1 induction have been established ( Postlind et al . , 1993 ; Garrison et al . , 1996 ; Bessette et al . , 2005 ) . The precise molecular mechanisms responsible for the tis - sue - specific expression and induction of the CYP1A2 remain unclear ( Eaton et al . , 1995 ) . AHR is believed to be involved in CYP1A2 induction because TCDD - or 3 - MC - mediated activa - tion of Cyp1a2 and Cyp1a1 was not detected in Ahr - null mice ( Fernandez - Salguero et al . , 1995 ; Schmidt et al . , 1996 ; Mimura et al . , 1997 ) . However , the cis - element responsible for transcriptional activation of CYP1A2 is not a typical XRE observed in the 5 (cid:2) - flanking region of CYP1A1 . Analysis of the 5 (cid:2) - flanking region of the human CYP1A2 revealed the exis - tence of two regions ( (cid:1) 2531 to (cid:1) 2423 and (cid:1) 2195 to (cid:1) 1987 ) responsible for the transcriptional activation ( Quattrochi et al . , 1994 ) . One was termed X1 , to which TCDD - inducible nuclear proteins bind weakly , and the other X2 , which does not interact with nuclear proteins . Neither of these elements was similar to the XRE nucleotide sequence found in the regulatory region of the CYP1A1 . Although the X1 is an indispensable element for 3 - MC - mediated transcriptional ac - tivation of the CYP1A2 , gene activation was not completely abolished by the removal of X1 , suggesting the involvement of additional regulatory elements in the transcriptional acti - vation of human CYP1A2 . The human CYP1A locus is found on chromosome 15 ( Jaiswal et al . , 1987 ) . The CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 are in head - to - head orientation and are separated by more than 20 kb of intervening DNA ( Corchero et al . , 2001 ) . There is no open reading frame between the two genes , indicating that they share a 5 (cid:2) - flanking region . Thus , the possibility exists for distinct regulatory regions specific for each gene or common regulatory regions for both genes . That cis - acting elements control the tissue - specific and AHR - mediated activation of both genes was demonstrated by the production of a trans - genic mouse expressing both the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 from a contiguous BAC genomic clone ( Cheung et al . , 2005 ; Jiang et al . , 2005 ) . To characterize the function of this spacer re - gion , the transcriptional activation of both CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 should be evaluated simultaneously . In the present study , transcriptional activation of the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes were independently examined by promoter - reporter gene assays to define the 5 (cid:2) - flanking regions responsible for transcriptional activation of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 . A dual reporter vector containing the intergenic spacer region be - tween human CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 was then produced to evaluate the regulatory regions in both directions simulta - neously . The results revealed that an XRE cluster existing near the CYP1A1 gene works bidirectionally and is essential not only for transcriptional activation by BNF and 3 - MC of CYP1A1 but also for CYP1A2 . Materials and Methods Materials . BNF and 3 - MC were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO ) . DMSO was obtained from WAKO Pure Chemicals ( Osaka , Japan ) . Oligonucleotides were prepared by Sigma - Genosys Japan ( Ishikari Hokkaido , Japan ) . Restriction endonucleases , except for Asp 718 ( Roche Diagnostics , Basel , Switzerland ) , and DNA - mod - ifying enzymes were purchased from Takara Bio ( Kyoto , Japan ) . Quantitative Analysis of CYP1A mRNA Contents . The hu - man hepatocellular carcinoma cell line , HepG2 , was obtained from the RIKEN cell bank ( Tsukuba , Japan ) and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , minimal essential medium nonessential amino acid , and penicillin / streptomycin / amphotericin ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . HepG2 cells were seeded in 48 - well plates and cultured for 40 h . BNF and 3 - MC was dissolved in DMSO and added to the cells at various concentrations . The concentration of DMSO did not exceed 0 . 1 % . Control cells were treated with 0 . 1 % DMSO . After 40 - h exposure , total RNA was extracted using ABI6100 ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) . Reverse transcription reactions were performed using TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagents with oligo ( dT ) primer ( Ap - plied Biosystems ) . Quantitative real - time PCR was performed with the use of ABI7900 ( Applied Biosystems ) . Primers used for the mea - surement of CYP1A1 mRNA were 5 (cid:2) - TGGTCTCCCTTCTCTA - CACTCTTGT - 3 and 5 (cid:2) - ATTTTCCCTATTACATTAAATCAATGGT - TC - 3 (cid:2) with SYBR Green . For the measurement of CYP1A2 mRNA , primers and TaqMan probe were used as described previously ( Finnstro¨m et al . , 2001 ) . Glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydroge - nase ( GAPDH ) was measured as an internal standard using primers 5 (cid:2) - GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC - 3 (cid:2) and 5 (cid:2) - GAAGATGGTGATGG - GATTTC - 3 (cid:2) with SYBR Green . Values of CYP1A mRNAs were nor - malized by the GAPDH mRNA levels . Isolation of a DNA Segment between CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 Genes . As shown in Fig . 1 , approximately 27 kb of DNA segment ( from (cid:3) 2420 of the CYP1A1 gene to (cid:3) 835 of the CYP1A2 gene ) were divided into three parts , and each fragment was amplified by PCR with TaKaRa LA Taq ( Takara Bio ) . A bacterial artificial chromo - some genomic clone containing the human CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes ( Corchero et al . , 2001 ) was used as the template . Primers used for the amplification of fragment 1 are 5 (cid:2) - GCGGTCGACGGCCGGC - CGGATCTCATTCTTTTTACAGCTGAATAGCACTCC - 3 (cid:2) ( forward primer ) and 5 (cid:2) - GCGGAATTCATCTTGGAGGTGGCTGCTGAGAGA - AGGTGC - 3 (cid:2) ( reverse primer ) . For the amplification of fragment 2 , 5 (cid:2) - GCGCTCGAGAGAATACCAGGCAGAAGATGGCAGAGG - 3 (cid:2) ( forward primer ) and 5 (cid:2) - GCGACGCGTGGCCGGCCATATAGTGCA - TATACACAATGGAGTGCTATTCAGCTGT - 3 (cid:2) ( reverse primer ) were used . Primers used for the amplification of fragment 3 are 5 (cid:2) - TCC - CAGCTACTCGAGAGGTTGACACACAAGAA - 3 (cid:2) ( forward primer ) and 5 (cid:2) - CGACGCGTCCCGCTCGAGGATCCTCATAAATGGTTTAG - CACCATCC - 3 (cid:2) ( reverse primer ) . Each fragment was subcloned into pCR - XL - TOPO ( Invitrogen ) . All joints in the constructs were con - firmed by sequencing ( Applied Biosystems ) . Construction of Reporter Plasmids . A construct p1A1 - 204 containing bases from (cid:1) 204 to (cid:3) 1039 of the CYP1A1 gene was prepared as follows ( see Fig . 3 ) : F1 was digested with Bsp1407I and BamHI , and the resultant fragment was inserted into the Asp718 and BglII sites of pSEAP2 - Basic vector ( Clontech , Mountain View , CA ) . To obtain p1A1 - 887 containing bases from (cid:1) 887 to (cid:3) 2420 of the CYP1A1 , F1 was digested with NheI and EcoRI , and the resultant fragment was inserted into the NheI and EcoRI sites of the pSEAP2 - Basic vector . F1 was digested with SpeI and EcoRI , and the resultant fragment was inserted into the pSEAP2 - Basic vector at NheI and Fig . 1 . Schematic diagram of the CYP1A gene cluster on human chromo - some 15 . The DNA segment between the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes was divided into three parts , named fragments 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .

A DNA fragment from (cid:1) 6445 to (cid:3) 2420 of the CYP1A1 gene was obtained from F1 by digesting with MunI and EcoRI and inserted into pSEAP2 - Basic at EcoRI sites to construct p1A1 - 6445 . To construct p1A1 - 8653 , F1 was digested with BamHI and inserted into pSEAP2 - Basic at the BglII site . F1 was digested with MluI and NheI , and the resultant 11 - kb DNA fragment was inserted into p1A1 - 887 at MluI ( present in the vector ) and NheI sites to construct p1A1 - 12188 . Constructs p1A1 - 8653D and p1A1 - 12188D were generated by digesting p1A1 - 8653 and p1A1 - 12188 with Bsp1407I and ligating themselves , respectively . A DNA fragment from (cid:1) 3203 to (cid:3) 60 of the CYP1A2 gene was obtained from F2 by digesting with KpnI , and the resultant fragment was inserted into pSEAP2 - Basic at a KpnI site to construct p1A2 - 3203 ( Fig . 4 ) . To construct p1A2 - 5221 , F2 was digested with XhoI and BamHI , and the resultant fragment was inserted into pSEAP2 - Basic at XhoI and BglII sites . F2 was digested with MluI and HindIII , and the resultant 3 . 4 - kb fragment was inserted into pSEAP2 - Basic , to which an 8 . 8 - kb fragment obtained from F2 by digesting with HindIII was inserted at the HindIII site to construct p1A2 - 12188 . F3 was digested with XhoI , and an approximately 9 . 5 - kb fragment was inserted into p1A2 - 5221 at XhoI site to con - struct p1A2 - 14664 . F1 was digested with SpeI , and the resultant fragment was inserted into p1A2 - 5221 at the NheI site to construct p1A2 - 5221E . The dual reporter vector ( pd - 1A1 / 1A2 ) was constructed as follows : F1 was digested with BamHI , and the resultant 10 - kb fragment was inserted into pGL3 - Basic vector ( Promega , Madison , WI ) at a BglII site . The resultant plasmid was digested with XhoI and SalI , and a 12 - kb fragment was obtained and inserted into p1A2 - 5221 at an XhoI site . The resultant construct was designated pd - 9 . 5k . A 9 . 5 - kb frag - ment was obtained from F3 by digesting with XhoI and inserted into pd - 9 . 5k at an XhoI site to construct the dual reporter vector contain - ing the DNA segment between (cid:3) 1039 of CYP1A1 and (cid:3) 90 of CYP1A2 , designated pd - 1A1 / 1A2 . Using pd - 9 . 5k , deletion mutants of the dual reporter vectors were prepared based on the standard method with the restriction sites indicated in Fig . 6 . To generate p1A2 - 22430 ( Fig . 4 ) , pd - 1A1 / 1A2 was digested with NheI and ligated itself . Deletion of each XRE was conducted using a QuikChange Site - Directed Mutagenesis Kit ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) . Transient Transfection and Measurement of Luc and SEAP Activities . HepG2 cells were seeded in 48 - well plates 12 h before transfection . Reporter plasmids were transfected using FuGene6 ( Roche Diagnostics ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . pRL - SV40 or pSV - (cid:1) - gal ( Promega ) was cotransfected for use as an internal standard . The day after transfection , BNF and 3 - MC were dissolved in DMSO and added to the medium at 10 and 1 (cid:2) M , respectively . The concentration of DMSO was 0 . 1 % . Control cells were treated with 0 . 1 % DMSO . After 40 - h exposure , aliquots of the medium were collected and incubated at 65°C for 20 min to inacti - vate the endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity , and cells were processed for luciferase assays . LumiPhos 530 ( Lumigen Inc . , South - field , MI ) was used as the substrate to measure SEAP activity . Luciferase activities were measured using Luciferase Assay System or Dual - Luciferase Assay Reagent ( Promega ) . (cid:1) - Galactosidase activ - ity was measured using the (cid:1) - Galactosidase Enzyme Assay System with Reporter Lysis Buffer ( Promega ) . Statistics . One - way analysis of variance with Dunnett’s post test was performed using Prism version 4 ( GraphPad Software Inc . , San Diego , CA ) for significant differences between the mean values of each group . Results Effects of BNF and 3 - MC on CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNA Levels . As shown in Fig . 2 , levels of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNAs in HepG2 cells were increased in a concen - tration - dependent manner after treatment with BNF or 3 - MC . The levels of CYP1A1 mRNA reached approximately 70 - and 25 - fold higher than controls with 10 (cid:2) M BNF and 1 (cid:2) M 3 - MC , respectively . CYP1A2 mRNA levels were also en - hanced in response to both compounds . The levels of CYP1A2 mRNA increased approximately 30 - and 20 - fold higher than controls after treatment with 10 (cid:2) M BNF and 1 (cid:2) M 3 - MC , respectively . HepG2 cells were thus used in the following experiments to study transcriptional activation of the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes . Fig . 2 . Effects of BNF and 3 - MC on CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNAs in HepG2 cells . BNF and 3 - MC were added to HepG2 cells at various concentrations . After 40 - h exposure , total RNA was extracted and sub - jected to quantitative reverse - transcriptase PCR . GAPDH was used as the internal standard . Values are represented as the ratio to DMSO - treated cells . Fig . 3 . 5 (cid:2) - Flanking region necessary for transcriptional activation of the CYP1A1 gene .

To determine the region responsible for transcriptional activation of the CYP1A1 , var - ious lengths of the 5 (cid:2) - flanking region were fused to SEAP vectors to verify elements essential for CYP1A1 induction . The largest chimeric reporter plasmid contained approxi - mately the 12 kb of the 5 (cid:2) - flanking region of the CYP1A1 gene ( (cid:1) 12 , 188 to (cid:3) 2420 ) . There are eight XRE sequences within this region , as shown at the top of Fig . 3 . These reporter plasmids were transiently transfected into HepG2 cells , and SEAP activities were determined after 40 h of treatment with 10 (cid:2) M BNF or 1 (cid:2) M 3 - MC . As shown in Fig . 3 , p1A1 - 204 , which has no XRE , did not show an increase in reporter activities after treatment with BNF and 3 - MC . Introduction of a single XRE ( p1A1 - 887 ) showed approximately 12 - fold increase of the reporter activ - ity in the presence of BNF . 3 - MC treatment also resulted in an approximately 19 - fold increase in reporter activity . Con - structs p1A1 - 5058 and p1A1 - 6445 containing seven and eight XRE sequences , respectively , showed the maximum in - creases of 32 - and 47 - fold reporter activities in response to BNF and 3 - MC , respectively . Reporter activity was de - creased to two thirds of the maximal activation after intro - duction of the 5 (cid:2) - flanking region further than (cid:1) 6445 into the reporter plasmid ( p1A1 - 8653 and p1A1 - 12188 ) . With con - structs having deletions from (cid:1) 8143 to (cid:1) 204 in p1A1 - 8653 or p1A1 - 12188 ( p1A1 - 8653D and p1A1 - 12188D ) , both reporter activities were lost . 5 (cid:1) - Flanking Region Necessary for Transcriptional Activation of the CYP1A2 Gene . Several SEAP vectors containing various lengths of the 5 (cid:2) - flanking region of human the CYP1A2 gene were generated . As shown in Fig . 4 , no clear enhancement of the reporter activities was observed on p1A2 - 3203 in the presence of BNF or 3 - MC . Although p1A2 - 5221 had a single XRE sequence , no clear increase of the reporter activities occurred after treatment with either com - pound . Furthermore , no response to BNF or 3 - MC was ob - tained with p1A2 - 12188 or p1A2 - 14664 containing three ad - ditional XRE sequences . Construct p1A2 - 22430 containing the largest insert , however , showed an approximately 5 - fold increase in response to BNF and 3 - MC . When the 5 (cid:2) - flanking region from (cid:1) 22430 to (cid:1) 18237 of the CYP1A2 gene was inserted into p1A2 - 5221 ( p1A2 - 5221E ) , an approximately 4 . 5 - fold increase in reporter activities was maintained in the presence of both compounds . Cotranscriptional Activation of the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 Genes . As described above , BNF - and 3 - MC - medi - ated transcriptional activation was not detected with the constructs , including an approximately 14 . 7 - kb 5 (cid:2) - flanking region of the CYP1A2 gene . However , further addition of the upstream region resulted in increased activities ( Fig . 4 ) . The region enhancing CYP1A2 transcription encompassed (cid:1) 887 to (cid:1) 5058 of CYP1A1 , in which multiple XREs were found . This region was also effective in transcriptional activation of the CYP1A1 gene ( Fig . 3 ) . These results suggested that the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes are under the control of a bidi - rectional and common regulatory mechanism . However , si - multaneous evaluation is necessary to assess the role of the common regulatory region on the transcriptional activation of both genes . Therefore , a DNA segment from (cid:3) 1039 of the CYP1A1 gene to (cid:3) 90 of the CYP1A2 gene was isolated ( Fig . 5A ) and inserted between two reporter genes ( SEAP and Luc ) to construct a dual reporter vector which was named pd - 1A1 / 1A2 ( Fig . 5B ) . As shown in Fig . 5C , BNF and 3 - MC treatment of cells transfected with pd - 1A1 / 1A2 resulted in the appear - ance of Luc and SEAP activities . Luc activity derived from transcriptional activation of the CYP1A1 gene increased ap - proximately 18 - fold after exposure of cells to BNF or 3 - MC . SEAP activity derived from transcriptional activation of the CYP1A2 gene increased approximately 2 to 3 times in re - Fig . 4 . 5 (cid:2) - Flanking region necessary for the transcriptional activation of the CYP1A2 gene .

After 40 - h exposure of cells to 10 (cid:2) M BNF or 1 (cid:2) M 3 - MC , SEAP , Luc , and RL activities were measured . Values of SEAP and Luc activities were normalized by RL activities and expressed as a ratio to DMSO - treated cells . Data are the mean (cid:4) S . E .

These results suggest that the in - serted DNA segment works bidirectionally for both the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 transcriptional activation . To identify a DNA region essential for activation of both CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 gene promoters , the regulatory region of pd - 1A1 / 1A2 was partially deleted , and reporter activities were determined and compared with those of pd - 1A1 / 1A2 . At first , upstream region within (cid:1) 18 , 096 of the CYP1A1 gene was partially deleted as shown in Fig . 6A . Deletion from (cid:1) 8653 to (cid:1) 18 , 096 of the CYP1A1 gene showed a 28 . 3 - fold increase in Luc activity in response to BNF . Deletion from (cid:1) 4621 to (cid:1) 18 , 096 of the CYP1A1 gene also increased Luc activity approximately 33 - fold . However , further deletion from (cid:1) 887 to (cid:1) 18 , 096 of the CYP1A1 gene dramatically decreased Luc activity to 7 - fold after exposure of cells to BNF . When the region from (cid:1) 464 to (cid:1) 18 , 096 was deleted , induction of Luc activity was completely lost . 3 - MC treat - ment of cells transfected with the dual reporter vector , which is deleted or nondeleted , resulted in Luc activity similar to BNF - treated cells . On the other hand , SEAP activity re - mained almost unchanged in the dual reporter vectors with DNA deleted from (cid:1) 887 to (cid:1) 18 , 996 , (cid:1) 4621 to (cid:1) 18 , 996 , or (cid:1) 8653 to (cid:1) 18 , 996 of the CYP1A1 gene in response to both compounds compared with the parental vector without dele - tion . However , deletion from (cid:1) 464 to (cid:1) 18 , 096 of the CYP1A1 gene lost inducible SEAP and Luc activity in response to both compounds . An upstream region within (cid:1) 21 , 992 of the CYP1A1 gene was also deleted as shown in Fig . 6B . Deletion from (cid:1) 18 , 909 to (cid:1) 21 , 992 of the CYP1A1 resulted in increased Luc and SEAP activities to 40 . 5 - and 9 . 3 - fold , respectively , after treat - ment of cells with BNF . These values are approximately 2 to 3 times higher than pd - 1A1 / 1A2 . In addition , the vector de - leted from (cid:1) 4621 to (cid:1) 21 , 992 of the CYP1A1 gene showed further increase in both reporter activities . Luc and SEAP activities in response to BNF reached 65 - and 11 - fold , respec - tively . Deletion from (cid:1) 1829 to (cid:1) 21 , 992 of the CYP1A1 gene resulted in no further influence on the Luc activity , whereas SEAP activity was still increased up to 17 - fold . Deletion from (cid:1) 462 to (cid:1) 21 , 992 of the CYP1A1 gene resulted in the com - plete loss of both of the reporter activities . 3 - MC treatment of cells resulted in profiles of changes in both reporter activities similar to those obtained with BNF - treated cells . Influence of a Single XRE Deletion on Dual Reporter Activities . As shown in Fig . 6B , the dual reporter vector lacking from (cid:1) 4621 to (cid:1) 21 , 992 of the CYP1A1 gene ( named pd - 4621 / 21992 ) showed high reporter activities . There were seven XRE sequences in the regulatory element of pd - 4621 / 21992 . Among them , five XREs close to the CYP1A1 gene transcription start site were considered important because the dual vector deleted from (cid:1) 1829 to (cid:1) 21 , 992 , which has these five XREs , showed further increase in CYP1A2 pro - moter activation . Therefore , these five XREs were designated XRE1 , XRE2 , XRE3 , XRE4 , and XRE5 , and five mutants of pd - 4621 / 21992 were generated in which each XRE was de - leted . The mutant vectors were transiently transfected into HepG2 cells , and reporter activities were measured in the presence of BNF or 3 - MC . The results are shown as the ratio to pd - 4621 / 21992 ( Fig . 7 ) . Deletion of each XRE decreased Luc activities for the Fig . 6 . Influence of deletion in the regulatory region on the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 gene activation . A schematic dia - gram of the regulatory region between the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes is indicated at the top of the figure . Closed boxes with numbers show the exons of the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes . Deletion mutants of the dual reporter con - structs are shown in the center . These vectors were pre - pared by the standard method with the restriction enzymes indicated in the diagram . The insert of pd - 1A1 / 1A2 was deleted within (cid:1) 18 , 096 ( A ) or (cid:1) 21 , 992 ( B ) of the CYP1A1 gene . Lower and upper numbers of each reporter construct represent the position from the transcriptional starting points of the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 , respectively .

Deletion of XRE1 and XRE3 had the most significantly decreased Luc activity of approximately 0 . 45 - and 0 . 32 - fold of pd - 4621 / 21992 , respectively ( Fig . 7 ) . Deletion of XRE2 , XRE4 , and XRE5 showed only slight decrease of Luc activities of a max - imal 0 . 66 - fold of pd - 4621 / 21992 . On the other hand , only deletion of XRE3 produced a drastic change in CYP1A1 pro - moter activity in response to 3 - MC . With the CYP1A2 pro - moter , as monitored by SEAP activity , the only marked de - crease was obtained with the disruption of XRE3 but only after treatment of cells with 3 - MC . Disruption of the other XREs produced a maximal decrease of (cid:5) 20 % of the SEAP activity obtained with pd - 4621 / 21992 ( Fig . 7 ) . It should be noted that these data may not reflect exactly the promoter activities that would be obtained when the complete 23 . 3 - kb intergenic sequence is included . Discussion In the present study , we analyzed the 5 (cid:2) - flanking region of the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes to identify each regulatory element that mediates transcriptional response to BNF and 3 - MC . As shown in Fig . 3 , approximately (cid:1) 5 . 0 kb or (cid:1) 6 . 4 kb of the 5 (cid:2) - flanking region of the CYP1A1 gene containing seven or eight XREs showed the highest transcriptional ac - tivation in response to both BNF and 3 - MC . These results are consistent with previous studies ( Kawajiri et al . , 1986 ; Ku - bota et al . , 1991 ) . Approximately (cid:1) 3 . 2 kb of the 5 (cid:2) - flanking region was reported to support 3 - MC - mediated transcrip - tional activation of the human CYP1A2 gene by 3 - MC ( Quat - trochi and Tukey , 1989 ; Quattrochi et al . , 1994 ) . However , a similar construct , p1A2 - 3203 , did not show transcriptional activation after the exposure of cells to 3 - MC ( Fig . 4 ) . The reason was unknown , but differences in the reporter vector constructs could be some of the reasons . BNF treatment also did not increase reporter activity in p1A2 - 3203 . Up to (cid:1) 14 . 7 kb of the 5 (cid:2) - flanking region of the CYP1A2 gene did not result in transcriptional activation in response to BNF and 3 - MC , although several XRE sequences were included . Further up - stream region encompassing (cid:1) 22 . 4 kb was needed to en - hance the transcriptional activation of the CYP1A2 gene . A similar result was observed when a DNA fragment from (cid:1) 22430 to (cid:1) 18 , 237 of CYP1A2 was connected to p1A2 - 5221 ( i . e . , p1A2 - 5221E ) . These results suggest that the distant regulatory region , near the CYP1A1 gene , is necessary to support transcriptional activation of the CYP1A2 gene . This is consistent with a recent report in vivo ; Jiang et al . ( 2005 ) showed that BAC - transgenic mice carrying only human CYP1A2 gene with (cid:1) 15 . 2 kb of the 5 (cid:2) - flanking region failed to increase CYP1A2 mRNA , whereas another mouse line carrying both the human CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 with the intact spacer region between the two genes were inducible for both genes in response to TCDD . The DNA fragment introduced in p1A2 - 5221E corresponds to the element from (cid:1) 887 to (cid:1) 5058 of the CYP1A1 gene containing several XREs . This region was also effective for the transcriptional activation of the CYP1A1 gene ( Fig . 3 ) . These data suggest the possibility that the identical regula - tory elements work simultaneously for transcriptional acti - vation of the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes . Thus , the element seemed to have bidirectional regulatory activity , which has been proposed recently in the human genome ( Trinklein et al . , 2004 ) . Therefore , to test this possibility , a dual reporter vector was produced containing the intergenic spacer region between the human CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes ( pd - 1A1 / 1A2 ) . As expected , transcriptional activation of both CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes was detected by treatment of cells with BNF and 3 - MC , indicating that the spacer region acts bidi - rectionally . However , the potency in transcriptional activa - tion was different between the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes . The transcriptional activation was much higher in the CYP1A1 gene than in the CYP1A2 gene . This result is partly consistent with the extent of induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNAs in HepG2 cells in response to BNF or 3 - MC ( Fig . 1 ) . To identify the elements essential for transcriptional acti - vation of the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes , several deletions of the dual reporter vector were produced . As shown in Fig . 6B , both reporter activities were decreased dramatically after deletion from (cid:1) 464 to (cid:1) 1829 of the CYP1A1 gene , which is consistent with (cid:1) 21 , 492 to (cid:1) 22 , 852 of the CYP1A2 gene . The regulatory region works bidirectionally to stimulate simulta - neously the transcriptional activation of the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes . Probably all XREs found as a cluster within this region are important as revealed by their influence on the CYP1A1 gene activation ( Kubota et al . , 1991 ) . Although the effect of single XRE deletion on the transcriptional acti - vation of the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes was different in response to BNF or 3 - MC , a single XRE does not seem to govern the regulation of these two gene promoters ( Fig . 7 ) . Similar results were reported on the mouse Cyp1a1 ( Fisher et al . , 1990 ) ; each replacement of individual XRE in the dioxin - responsive enhancer element of the mouse Cyp1a1 gene did not have a dramatic effect on transcriptional acti - vation by TCDD . However , deletion of the whole XRE cluster resulted in loss of transcriptional activation of the Cyp1a1 gene . From these results , several XREs involved in the bidi - rectional regulatory region may work cooperatively or addi - Fig . 7 . Influence of a single XRE deletion on the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 gene activation . Dual reporter vector deleted from (cid:1) 4621 to (cid:1) 21 , 992 of the CYP1A1 gene ( designated pd - 4621 / 21992 ) is shown at the top . The region from (cid:1) 4621 to (cid:3) 1039 of the CYP1A1 gene was enlarged and is shown in the center of the figure . Five XREs close to the CYP1A1 gene were independently deleted by site - directed mutagenesis . Lower and upper numbers of each reporter construct represent the position from the transcriptional starting points of the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 , respectively . Luc and SEAP activities are shown in the left and the right graphs , respectively . Data are the mean (cid:4) S . E . M . from three independent exper - iments performed in triplicate .

In the present study , we focused on the XRE , but involve - ment of unknown other regulatory elements could not be excluded . For example , a new regulatory element ( XRE II ) was identified , in which the AHR - ARNT heterodimer does not directly bind , suggesting that another yet - to - be - identified transcriptional factor binds to the XRE II with the AHR - ARNT heterodimer acting as a coactivator ( Sogawa et al . , 2004 ) . A similar mechanism might also be involved in the regulation of the human CYP1A2 gene , but the importance of the regulatory region containing the XRE cluster on the transcriptional activation of the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 was demonstrated in the present study . The XRE cluster may be the principal regulatory region governing induction of both the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes . A negative control region working bidirectionally on the transcriptional activation of the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes was also found . The region of suppressive activity exists between (cid:1) 18 , 909 and (cid:1) 21 , 992 of the CYP1A1 gene , which encompasses (cid:1) 1329 to (cid:1) 4412 of the CYP1A2 gene . The na - ture and mechanism of this negative bidirectional regulatory element requires additional studies . It should also be noted that in rodent models ( Goldstein and Linko , 1984 ) and probably also in humans , CYP1A2 is constitutively expressed in liver and not to any significant degree in extrahepatic tissues , even after treatment of ani - mals with inducers . CYP1A1 , on the other hand , is not con - stitutively expressed in liver and is inducible in liver and many extrahepatic tissues . This suggests the existence of regulatory elements that independently control the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes . For example , binding sites for HNF1 (cid:3) and HNF4 (cid:3) exist in the intergenic spacer region ( Corchero et al . , 2001 ) . In mice , Cyp1a2 is regulated by HNF1 (cid:3) ( Cheung et al . , 2003 ) . The mechanisms governing constitutive regulation of the CYP1A gene require further study . In conclusion , an XRE cluster in the (cid:1) 22 . 4 - kb 5 (cid:2) - flanking region near the CYP1A1 gene is necessary for the transcrip - tional activation of the human CYP1A2 gene in response to BNF and 3 - MC . Experiments using a dual reporter vector containing the intergenic spacer region between CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes indicate that the region encompassing (cid:1) 464 to (cid:1) 1829 of the CYP1A1 gene works bidirectionally to affect not only CYP1A1 induction but also CYP1A2 induction . In addition , a negative bidirectional element is probably located within (cid:1) 18 , 909 to (cid:1) 21 , 992 of CYP1A1 . These results strongly suggest that transcriptional activation of the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes is regulated simultaneously through a common regulatory element existing between these two genes that acts bidirectionally .
