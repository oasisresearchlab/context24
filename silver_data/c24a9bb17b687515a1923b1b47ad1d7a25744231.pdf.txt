In addition to this primary function , aldolase is also known to bind to a variety of other proteins , a property that may allow it to perform ‘moonlighting’ roles in the cell . Although monomeric and dimeric aldolases possess full catalytic activity , the enzyme occurs as an unusually stable tetramer , suggesting a possible link between the oligomeric state and these noncatalytic cellular roles . Here , the ﬁrst high - resolution X - ray crystal structure of rabbit muscle D128V aldolase , a dimeric form of aldolase mimicking the clinically important D128G mutation in humans associated with hemolytic anemia , is presented . The structure of the dimer was determined to 1 . 7 A˚ resolution with the product DHAP bound in the active site . The turnover of substrate to produce the product ligand demonstrates the retention of catalytic activity by the dimeric aldolase . The D128V mutation causes aldolase to lose intermolecular contacts with the neighboring subunit at one of the two interfaces of the tetramer . The tertiary structure of the dimer does not signiﬁcantly differ from the structure of half of the tetramer . Analytical ultracentrifugation conﬁrms the occur - rence of the enzyme as a dimer in solution . The highly stable structure of aldolase with an independent active site is consistent with a model in which aldolase has evolved as a multimeric scaffold to perform other noncatalytic functions .

Introduction Fructose - 1 , 6 - bisphosphate aldolase ( aldolase ; EC 4 . 1 . 2 . 13 ) is a ubiquitously expressed glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the reversible cleavage of fructose 1 , 6 - bisphosphate ( Fru 1 , 6 - P 2 ) to dihydroxyacetone phosphate ( DHAP ) and glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate ( G3P ) in glycolysis and the reverse reaction in gluconeogenesis . In addition , aldolase is involved in the metabolism of fructose , converting fructose 1 - phosphate ( Fru 1 - P ) to DHAP and glyceraldehyde ( Horecker et al . , 1975 ) . There are two classes of aldolases based on their chemical mechanism : class I enzymes are cofactor - independent and catalyze C—C bond cleavage via the formation of a Schiff - base intermediate with the sugar , whereas class II enzymes require a divalent metal ion for catalysis . The class I aldolases of vertebrates are further subdivided into three isozymes that have different activities and vary in their tissue distribution ( Rutter , 1964 ) . The isoforms aldolase A ( predominantly present in muscle ) and aldolase C ( in brain ) have higher activity towards Fru 1 , 6 - P 2 than towards Fru 1 - P . Aldolase B ( in liver ) has equal turnover numbers for both Fru 1 , 6 - P 2 and Fru 1 - P , corresponding to its role in fructose metabolism in the liver ( Penhoet & Rutter , 1971 ) . The amino - acid sequences of these isozymes are highly conserved , predominantly at the subunit interface and the active site ( Rottmann et al . , 1984 , 1987 ; Lai et al . , 1974 ; Deng & Smith , 1999 ) , with 81 , 70 and 70 % overall sequence identity between A and C , between A and B and between B and C , respectively . Biochemical studies supported by crystal structures have shown that class I aldolases are invariably present as homo - tetramers ( Penhoet et al . , 1967 ) . Each subunit has an inde - pendent active site that resides in the center of the barrel in a ( (cid:1) / (cid:2) ) 8 - barrel fold ( Sygusch et al . , 1987 ) . Although the quaternary structure is not required for enzymatic activity ( Beernink & Tolan , 1996 ) , the dissociation constant is unusually low , of the order of 10 (cid:1) 26 M 3 for the monomer – tetramer equilibrium ( Tolan et al . , 2003 ) . This dissociation constant is lower than those of other glycolytic enzymes and raises the question of why aldolase has evolved to possess such a very tight interaction at the protein – protein interfaces . Steady - state kinetic studies of aldolase isozymes have shown no cooperativity among the subunits , thus aldolase does not display allosteric regulation ( Penhoet & Rutter , 1971 ) . Perhaps linked to these ﬁndings , there is considerable evidence that aldolase participates in nonmetabolic processes in addition to its enzymatic role . Aldolase is involved in binding interactions with several other proteins , but the functional role of aldolase in these interactions has not been fully characterized . Aldolases A and C have been found to bind to the neuroﬁlament light - chain mRNA in neurons ( Can˜ete - Soler et al . , 2005 ) . Aldolase A associates with the vacuolar H + - ATPase ( Lu et al . , 2001 ) and is thought to mediate its assembly , expression , and activity as a proton pump ( Lu et al . , 2004 ) . Aldolase also plays a role in the control of proteins involved in endocytosis ( Lundmark & Carlsson , 2004 ) . There are other binding partners for which no func - tional role has been established , including (cid:3) - tubulin ( Volker & Knull , 1997 ) , heparin ( Ta et al . , 1999 ) , phospholipase D ( Kim et al . , 2002 ) and the glucose transporter GLUT4 ( Kao et al . , 1999 ) . Aldolase A has been proposed to play a structural role in the assembly of the actin cytoskeleton in vivo owing to its well established ability to bind F - actin ( Arnold & Pette , 1968 ; Arnold et al . , 1971 ; O’Reilly & Clarke , 1993 ) . Further studies have shown that tetrameric aldolase can cross - link F - actin ﬁlaments into a gel or rafts , which is consistent with a potential role for this enzyme in the regulation of cytoskeleton structure ( Pagliaro & Taylor , 1988 ; Wang et al . , 1996 ; Sukow & De - Rosier , 1998 ) . The ability to cross - link actin points to the multimeric state of aldolase as a prerequisite for its ‘moon - lighting’ functions , i . e . a single protein – protein interface can thus provide multiple interactions . Some of the activities of aldolase appear to link catalytic activity to quaternary structure . Aldolase A deﬁciency is an autosomal recessive trait and has been associated with nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia in humans ( Beutler et al . , 1973 ) . One of the most well studied alleles , D128G ( Kishi et al . , 1987 ) , results in a thermally unstable protein . The source of this instability has been studied further using this and other Asp128 substitutions ( Beernink & Tolan , 1994 ) and showed that the varying degrees of thermolability correlated with varying degrees of dissociation into dimers . The largest shift in the equilibrium towards the dimer is caused by the substitu - tion of Asp128 by Val ( Beernink & Tolan , 1994 ) . The structure of the aldolase tetramer and the position of Asp128 are shown in Fig . 1 . Here , using D128V aldolase , a high - resolution crystal structure of the dimeric form was explored . The data provided a structural basis for understanding the loss of quaternary structure and showed that the protein was stable in the dimeric form . Remarkably , the dimer did not differ signiﬁcantly from the corresponding half - tetramer in native aldolases . Since the asymmetric unit contained a single monomer , analysis of D128V aldolase was performed via analytical ultra - centrifugation to support the assignment of the crystallo - graphically generated dimer as the biological unit . The product DHAP was bound to the active site after crystal - lization with the substrate Fru 1 , 6 - P 2 , which showed that D128V aldolase was catalytically competent . The crystal structure of the dimer will provide a structural basis for studies of aldolase in its role as a binding partner in cellular processes . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Expression and purification of recombinant aldolase D128V aldolase was puriﬁed as previously described ( Beernink & Tolan , 1994 ) , with the exception that in the last step of puriﬁcation the CM - Sepharose Fast Flow ( GE research papers 544 Sherawat et al . (cid:2) Aldolase D128V Acta Cryst . ( 2008 ) . D 64 , 543 – 550 Figure 1 Rabbit muscle fructose - 1 , 6 - bisphophate aldolase tetramer ( Blom & Sygusch , 1997 ; PDB code 1ado ) . Each monomer is colored separately , with the A and B interfaces indicated by arrows as described previously ( Beernink & Tolan , 1994 ) . The sites of the D128V substitutions are indicated by red spheres on interface B and the C - and N - termini are labeled for monomer A . Healthcare ) column was washed with 50 m M TAPS – glycine – KOH pH 8 . 3 , 1 m M dithiothreitol ( DTT ) and D128V aldolase was eluted with the same buffer containing 2 m M Fru 1 , 6 - P 2 . Activity was determined by following NADH oxidation at 340 nm in a coupled assay with triosephosphate isomerase and glycerol - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( Racker , 1947 ) . The active fractions were concentrated and exchanged with crys - tallization buffer comprised of 50 m M Tris – HCl pH 7 . 0 , 50 m M NaCl , 25 m M ammonium acetate using an Ultrafree centrifugal concentrator ( Millipore ) with a 10 kDa molecular - weight cutoff membrane . The protein was > 95 % pure as assessed by SDS – PAGE . 2 . 2 . Crystallization , data collection and processing D128V aldolase crystals were grown by the hanging - drop vapor - diffusion method using Hampton Research Crystal Screens I and II to screen initial crystallization conditions . The ﬁnal optimized condition used a 1 : 1 ratio of protein in crys - tallization buffer to reservoir solution ( 0 . 2 M ammonium sulfate , 25 % PEG 2K monomethyl ether ( PEG 2K MME ) , 100 m M sodium acetate pH 5 . 1 ) with a ﬁnal volume of 2 m l , which was equilibrated against 0 . 5 ml reservoir solution at 291 K . The initial condition was optimized by the addition of osmolytes ( naturally occurring compounds that affect protein stability ; Bolen & Baskakov , 2001 ) to favor ordering in the C - terminal region . The addition of 100 m M sarcosine to the crystallization condition yielded pyramidal crystals with dimensions 0 . 1 (cid:3) 0 . 05 (cid:3) 0 . 05 mm within 3 d . X - ray diffraction data from D128Valdolase crystals were collected on beamline X29 at Brookhaven National Laboratory . The crystals were cryoprotected by passing them through Paratone - N prior to ﬂash - freezing in a stream of gaseous N 2 at 100 K . The programs DENZO and SCALEPACK ( Otwinowski & Minor , 1997 ) were used to integrate and scale the data to a resolution of 1 . 70 A˚ . D128V aldolase crystallized in space group P 2 1 2 1 2 , with unit - cell parameters a = 53 . 32 , b = 137 . 90 , c = 50 . 15 A˚ . The data - collection statistics are summarized in Table 1 . 2 . 3 . Structural solution and refinement The structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program AMoRe ( Navaza , 1994 ) using a monomer from the structure of wild - type human muscle aldolase A ( PDB code 1ald ; Gamblin et al . , 1991 ) as the initial search model . The orientation of the monomer obtained by molecular replace - ment was improved by rigid - body reﬁnement using the Crys - tallography & NMR System ( CNS ) program suite ( Bru¨nger et al . , 1998 ) . (cid:4) A - weighted electron - density maps with coefﬁcients 2 F o (cid:1) F c calculated from the model after rigid - body reﬁne - ment in the program CNS showed good electron density for all areas of the monomer with the exception of the N - terminal ( 1 – 4 ) and C - terminal regions ( 345 – 363 ) , which failed to appear even after subsequent rounds of reﬁnement . To mini - mize model bias in the electron - density maps , the side chain of residue 128 was modeled as an alanine . The density was clearly that of a valine in the 2 F o (cid:1) F c map and was modeled as such in subsequent rounds of reﬁnement . Iterative rounds of model building using Coot ( Emsley & Cowtan , 2004 ) were performed alternately with rounds of positional , group temperature - factor and simulated - annealing reﬁnement in the program CNS . A test set consisting of 10 % of the data was used for R free calculations . In the ﬁnal rounds of reﬁnement water molecules were included using a 3 (cid:4) cutoff . A total of 655 water molecules were added to the model as well as six sulfates which were bound at the surface of the protein . In the ﬁnal round of reﬁnement , a composite - omit electron - density map was used to ﬁt the models of DHAP and sulfate to the active site . The ﬁnal structure had a working R factor of 0 . 189 and a free R factor of 0 . 209 . Analysis of the Ramachandran plot deﬁned by PROCHECK ( Laskowski et al . , 1993 ) showed good statistics for the model , with 91 . 8 % of residues in the most favorable regions and 8 . 2 % of residues in additionally allowed regions for D128V aldolase . 2 . 4 . Analytical ultracentrifugation Puriﬁed D128V aldolase was dialyzed against 0 . 2 M ammonium sulfate , 100 m M sodium acetate and 0 . 1 m M DTT . The buffer was kept consistent with the crystallization buffer but with the exclusion of 25 % PEG 2K MME , which forms a highly viscous solution that slows the equilibration process . Analytical ultracentrifugation ( Beckman XLA - 90 , Beckman Coulter ) was performed to determine the oligomerization state of D128V aldolase using 0 . 2 , 0 . 5 and 1 mg ml (cid:1) 1 aldolase research papers Acta Cryst .

The equilibrium state was veriﬁed at each speed and protein concentration was monitored at 280 nm . A two - compartment pharmacokinetic model was ﬁtted to individual data by means of the program WINNONLIN v . 2 . 1 ( Metzler , 1989 ) . 2 . 5 . Analysis of domain movement The change in intersubunit orientation of the dimer in comparison to the tetramer was measured using the program DynDom ( Hayward et al . , 1997 ) . The buried surface area between monomers was calculated for the structures of aldolase ( PDB code 1ado ) and D128V aldolase using CNS with a probe radius of 1 . 4 A˚ ( Lee & Richards , 1971 ) . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Overall structure The asymmetric unit contained a single monomer of D128V aldolase , with residues 5 – 344 of the subunit modeled into electron density . The structure was reﬁned to a resolution of 1 . 7 A˚ with a ﬁnal R factor of 18 . 9 % and an R free of 21 . 0 % . The ﬁrst four N - terminal residues and the 19 C - terminal residues ( 345 – 363 ) were disordered with no observable electron density , which is consistent with previously reported crystal structures ( Sygusch et al . , 1987 ; Choi et al . , 1999 ) . Crystallographic data - collection and reﬁnement statis - tics are reported in Table 1 . The structure of the monomer is not signiﬁcantly different from that of wild - type aldolase , with an r . m . s . deviation of 0 . 50 A˚ . The density at the site of substitution was well accounted for , reﬂecting a change in the side chain with no molecular disorder in the region ( Fig . 2 ) . 3 . 2 . Crystal - packing analysis The crystallographic asymmetric unit of the aldolase structure contained one monomer . Upon building the symmetry mates , the monomer formed a tightly packed dimer with its counterpart in the neighboring asymmetric unit . However , there were no counterparts of this symmetry dimer to form the native tetramer . Thus , the structure demonstrated a dimeric oligomerization state . The structural differences between the D128Valdolase dimer and the wild - type tetramer ( PDB code 1ado ) were not signiﬁcant . An overlay of the main - chain C (cid:1) atoms of the dimer with those of the wild - type aldolase A dimer ( subunits B and C ) gave an overall r . m . s . deviation of 0 . 81 A ˚ ( Fig . 3 ) . The 19 residues in the C - terminal region ( residues 345 – 363 ) were not included in the calcula - tions owing to their lack of ordered structure . The difference in the relative orientations of the monomers within the D128V aldolase compared with half of the tetramer was analyzed using the program DynDom ( Hayward et al . , 1997 ) . The conformational difference was measured by overlaying a single monomer from the D128Valdolase on one monomer of the aldolase tetramer and measuring the displacement of the second monomer , yielding a 4 . 1 (cid:4) rotation at the dimer inter - face . The result was largely a rigid - body movement of the monomer with the A interface of the dimer acting as a hinge axis . 3 . 3 . Analytical ultracentrifugation Sedimentation - equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation was employed to show that D128V aldolase is dimeric under the same conditions as those used for crystallization for X - ray research papers 546 Sherawat et al .

The data were a good ﬁt to a monodisperse model with a molecular weight equal to that of the aldolase dimer , 79 580 (cid:5) 350 Da ( Fig . 4 ) , which is nearly the same as the calculated molecular weight of 78 388 Da . The data were not consistent when a monomer or tetramer was used for ﬁtting ( ﬁt not shown ) . These data conﬁrm that D128Valdolase forms a dimer in solution . 3 . 4 . Subunit interface The native aldolase is a homotetramer with two unique interfaces described as interface A and interface B ( see Fig . 1 ) . In contrast to the A interface , which is comprised of helix - packing interactions , the B interface exhibits loop – loop interactions formed by ten buried hydrogen bonds ( Table 2 ) . At each B interface , six of the hydrogen bonds involve the carboxylate O atoms of Asp128 interacting with the backbone amides of three consecutive residues ( Gly126 , Leu127 and Asp128 ) of the neighboring subunit ( Fig . 5 ) . The hydrophobic side chain of valine cannot form hydrogen bonds . Thus , D128V aldolase retains only the A interface , consistent with a crystallographic dimer . The loop region ﬂanking the substi - tuted Asp128 residue shows no major displacement arising from the loss of these conserved hydrogen bonds . 3 . 5 . Calculation of the buried surface area Calculation of the buried surface area for the tetramer ( PDB code 1ado ) showed extensive interactions between the monomer interfaces . The dimer interface buries 869 A˚ 2 of surface area , while the tetramer buries 3460 A˚ 2 . The buried surface area of D128V aldolase did not signiﬁcantly differ from the same dimer interface of the tetramer ( 851 A˚ 2 ) . If the crystal contacts from adjacent dimers were included , a total value of 2146 A˚ 2 was obtained . There was a net loss of 1314 A˚ 2 surface area for the D128V aldolase dimer when compared with the tetramer . Thus , the crystal contacts do not compen - sate for the loss in buried surface area of the B interface . It is curious that D128V aldolase did not pack into the wild - type tetramer during crystallization . Certainly , there are no steric constraints to prevent this . In contrast , the dimeric aldolase B A149P variant ( Malay et al . , 2002 ) did form the tetramer in the crystalline state ( Malay et al . , 2005 ) . 3 . 6 .

The coloring scheme is identical to that of Fig . 1 for the ribbons , with a ball - and - stick representation in yellow for one monomer and in orange for the second monomer . 1997 ; Choi et al . , 1999 , 2001 ) and have provided insight into aldolase substrate recognition and catalysis . The active site of rabbit muscle aldolase A is located in the center of the barrel and includes a number of conserved charged residues ( Arg42 , Lys107 , Lys146 , Glu187 and Arg303 ) that are in close proxi - mity to the Schiff base - forming Lys229 ( Lai et al . , 1965 ) . A molecule of the product DHAP and a sulfate ion were found liganded to the active site of the dimeric D128V aldolase ( Fig . 6 a ) . The presence of the product was a consequence of the cleavage of Fru 1 , 6 - P 2 ( retained from the puriﬁcation process , which included elution with substrate ) . The C1 phosphate was bound by hydrogen bonds to the " - amino group of Lys229 and the main - chain N atoms of Ser271 and Gly272 as is found in other aldolase – DHAP structures ( Blom & Sygusch , 1997 ; Choi et al . , 2001 ; St - Jean et al . , 2007 ) . The C2 carbonyl and the C3 hydroxyl make hydrogen bonds to the Arg303 main - chain N atom and guanidino group , respectively . The sulfate ion binds to a site comprised of residues Arg303 , Lys41 and Arg42 , all of which are known to bind the C6 phosphate of Fru 1 , 6 - P 2 ( Choi et al . , 1999 ; St - Jean et al . , 2005 ) . There was some displacement of residues Lys41 , Arg42 and Arg303 in the D128V aldolase structure when compared with previously solved DHAP - liganded structures ( Fig . 6 b ) owing to their binding interaction with the sulfate ion . 4 . Discussion Fructose - 1 , 6 - bisphosphate aldolase has a highly conserved tetrameric structure with an atypical , low dissociation constant ( Tolan et al . , 2003 ) . A possible explanation for this unusual stability is that it may have evolved as a tether molecule for roles in the cell other than those as a catalyst . The two interfaces in the quaternary structure ( A and B ) are highly conserved amongst aldo - lases from varied sources ( Beernink & Tolan , 1994 , 1996 ) . The A interface is rela - tively hydrophobic , while the B interface is hydrophilic in nature and has buried hydrogen bonds making loop – loop inter - actions . It has been shown previously that substitution at one of these interfaces leads to the dissociation of aldolase into dimers ( Beernink & Tolan , 1994 ) . Monomers have been formed by making single mutations at each of the two interfaces . Both the mono - meric and dimeric forms are fully active ( Beernink & Tolan , 1996 ) . Dissociation of the wild - type enzyme can only be accom - plished under harsh conditions ( Hsu & Neet , 1973 , 1975 ; Lebherz , 1972 ; Rudolph et al . , 1976 ; Gerschitz et al . , 1977 ; Engelhard et al . , 1976 ) . Remarkably , previous studies of aldolase unfolding show that in 4 M urea , although most of the backbone is unfolded , three short segments located at the subunit interface remain intact , maintaining the protein in a tetrameric state ( Deng & Smith , 1999 ) . Mutations that lead to inborn errors in metabolism are often associated with the subunit interfaces . The human research papers 548 Sherawat et al . (cid:2) Aldolase D128V Acta Cryst . ( 2008 ) . D 64 , 543 – 550 Figure 6 Stereoview of the active site of fructose 1 , 6 - bisphosphate .

Hydrogen bonds are shown in black for D128V aldolase and in green for the wild - type structure . mutations D128G , E206K and G346S are associated with nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia and myopathy ( Kishi et al . , 1987 ; Kreuder et al . , 1996 ; Esposito et al . , 2004 ) . Biochemical studies on the D128G substitution have shown that the consequence of substitution at position Asp128 is an active dimer that is thermolabile . Other substitutions at Asp128 showed that the tetramer – dimer dissociation is shifted further to the right by the substitution of Asp128 by Val ( Beernink & Tolan , 1994 ) than by substitution by Gly or Ala . The structure of D128V aldolase showed that this substi - tution yielded a stable dimer . There was a negligible pertur - bation in the tertiary structure of the monomers . Moreover , the A interface of the dimer was retained and did not differ signiﬁcantly from that of the tetramer , indicating that the interactions were strong enough to maintain the stable dimer . The most compelling evidence was that at 291 K the crystal - packing forces did not reform the tetramer although signiﬁ - cant buried surface area was lost . The enzyme was stable enough to form a dimer in solution as observed via analytical ultracentrifugation . The strength of this interface is consistent with a potential role of the quaternary structure of aldolase as a tether molecule . Finally , the presence of the product DHAP trapped in the active site after crystallization with Fru 1 , 6 - P 2 was an indica - tion that the enzyme remains catalytically active in the absence of its native tetrameric structure . Together , these results strongly suggest that the quaternary structure of native aldolase is crucial to the performance of its many other cellular roles .
