For HIV / AIDS research , we examine the dynamics of disciplinary integration ( or lack thereof ) providing insight into a field’s knowledge base and those questions that remain unresolved . Drawing on the complete histories of two interdisciplinary journals , we construct bibliographic coupling networks based on overlapping citations to identify segregation into research clusters and estimate topic models of research content . We then compare how readily those bibliographic coupling clusters account for the structuring of topics covered within the field as it evolves over two decades . These comparisons challenge one - dimensional and / or cross - sectional approaches to interdisciplinarity . Some topics are increasingly coordinated across disciplinary boundaries ( e . g . , vaccine development ) ; others remain relatively segmented into disconnected disciplinary domains for the full period ( e . g . , drug resistance ) . This divergence indicates heterogeneity in interdisciplinarity and emphasizes the need for critical approaches to studying the organization of science . Introduction Many contemporary global problems transcend disciplinary boundaries imposed by institutions of higher education . Solutions to problems such as poverty , conflict , resource depletion , or disease likely demand interdisciplinary colla - boration . HIV / AIDS research , for example , does not belong to any single discipline , with scientists making important contributions from a range of basic , OPEN ACCESS Citation : Adams J , Light R ( 2014 ) Mapping Interdisciplinary Fields : Efficiencies , Gaps and Redundancies in HIV / AIDS Research .

Moreover , recent initiatives from funders and other institutional actors have prioritized increasing interdisciplinary integration [ 2 , 3 ] . In fact , HIV / AIDS research could be considered innovative in this trend having separate interdisciplinary review panels from early in the life - course of NIH funding for HIV / AIDS research [ 1 ] . These integrative aims presuppose that research connecting diverse perspectives will more rapidly produce solutions to the most pressing scientific and public health issues [ 3 – 5 ] . Despite these lofty goals , the utility of interdisciplinary research is difficult to evaluate [ 6 , 7 ] . The stakes of interdisciplinarity remain high because poor coordination could limit the potential for important scientific advances . Additionally , large societal investment is banking on the success of these approaches . In socio - medical research , successful communication can result in strategies to improve population health outcomes [ 8 – 10 ] , for example the discovery and implementation of tactics for preventing mother to child transmission of HIV . Conversely , its absence may partially account for insufficient progress towards other goals , such as the large numbers of people currently living with HIV / AIDS who continue to lack access to appropriate treatment regimens . At the same time , interdisciplinarity may siphon funding and attention away from research questions that demand more focused , disciplinary research . How do we account for the promises and pitfalls of interdisciplinary research ? Scholars studying the structure of scientific production have long - recognized the importance of informal interactions , including citation practices , which bridge traditional disciplinary boundaries for shaping the content and progress of fields [ 11 ] . Moreover , the ways these interactions cross disciplinary boundaries can help to shape what is known and how scientists evaluate what questions are worth addressing and what evidence ‘‘counts’’ when providing answers [ 12 , 13 ] . Work that bridges disciplinary boundaries can take many forms , each having differing implications for how problems get addressed [ 14 ] . At the extremes , disciplinarity constrains topics within single disciplinary boundaries , and transdisciplinarity eliminates the salience of disciplinary boundaries altogether . Most integrative work exists somewhere in between ; a field organized in an ‘‘interdisciplinary’’ fashion is marked by literatures that combine ideas across disciplinary boundaries to jointly address topic - based research problems [ 3 ] . ‘‘Multidisciplinary’’ research incorporates broad simultaneous engagement with research questions that incorporates many disciplinary perspectives , but does so in a way that retains disciplinary separation [ 3 ] . Moreover , evaluating how open or resolved questions in a field compare / differ in their respective trajectories across these forms can help to identify not just if , but how integrative efforts in problem - based areas of science successfully navigate these processes of disciplinary integration . Recent work demonstrates the utility of scientometric approaches for accounting for boundary structure and dynamics to examine the whole of science [ 4 , 15 ] , or for single academic disciplines [ 16 , 17 ] . These approaches provide tools that are well suited to address questions of interdisciplinary integration in research fields like HIV / AIDS [ 18 , 19 ] . These tools can help us identify cross - sectional Bibliographic Coupling in HIV / AIDS Research PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0115092 December 15 , 2014 2 / 13 patterns within scientific communities and can explicate how those patterns evolve over the life course of fields [ 20 ] . As such , we examine how integrated the field of HIV / AIDS research was over a two decade period and how that integration evolved as the field matured . We discuss the implications of that structuring as it accounts for particular scientific discoveries ( e . g . , the development and implementation of antiretroviral therapies ) and characteristic areas that remain unresolved . Data and Analyses Our data come from all published articles , letters and notes in the two top interdisciplinary journals for HIV / AIDS research – AIDS and JAIDS – from their respective first issues through the end of 2008 . This includes a total of 16 , 907 published items ( 10 , 218 from AIDS and 6 , 689 from JAIDS ) . We retrieved the full bibliographic information ( including complete cited references lists ) and abstract text for each of these items from ISI Web of Science . Analyses address this complete corpus and each journal separately . To identify the structure and content of research communities in the AIDS / JAIDS corpus , we combine bibliographic coupling networks with topic models , presenting results for the complete time - collapsed corpus ( i . e . , treating the full corpus as a single literature ) and a series of time - based moving windows to examine the evolution of patterns over two decades . First , for each pair of papers in the corpus , we construct a paper - to - paper bibliographic coupling network [ 21 , 22 ] . To construct the bibliographic coupling network , we use data preprocessing capabilities in [ 23 ] to compute the extent to which papers in our corpus ( N 5 16 , 907 ) jointly cite the same papers , using cosine - weighted cited - reference similarity scores [ 24 ] ; results did not differ appreciably when alternatively employing weights based on simple citation counts or Jaccard similarity [ 25 ] . All bibliographic - coupling network analyses presented in the paper rely on these fully weighted cited reference similarity scores . However , to reduce some of the noise in visualizations , the network representations in Fig . 1 recode this similarity matrix to dichotomous presence / absence of ties between paper pairs with similarity scores that exceed the mean score plus two standard deviations ; this computation excludes all isolates ( i . e . , those papers that share no citations with any other papers in the corpus ) . Second , we analyze those networks with community detection approaches , which identify segmentation within a network [ 26 , 27 ] . Formally , this is generally computed as locating blocks of the network for which some majority of ties are formed within the group and relatively few ties are formed outside those groups [ 27 ] . There are numerous strategies for finding network communities ; here we use the fast - greedy algorithm [ 28 ] for computing the Newman and Girvan [ 26 ] index as implemented in igraph 0 . 6 – 2 [ 29 ] for R 3 . 0 . 1 ; results did not differ appreciably when using the Louvain method as an alternative [ 30 ] . Modularity maximization is a common strategy for finding the number of communities in a graph and can Bibliographic Coupling in HIV / AIDS Research PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0115092 December 15 , 2014 3 / 13 be used to describe how readily the identified communities account for the structure of an observed network [ 31 ] . Modularity scores represent locally maximized functions that identify how readily ties form within as opposed to across communities . Our results below rely on solutions that identify between 6 – 9 communities identified ( depending on the period ) . While the raw interpretation of modularity scores is rare , comparison across networks with similar numbers of nodes and ties can reveal any substantial changes in community structure over time [ 27 ] , which we summarize by plotting the structural changes over time . We then use an Alluvial Flow diagram described in [ 32 ] to visualize how the detected communities change over time . Fig . 1 . Bibliographic Coupling Network Communities in the Complete Corpus . Panel A presents the full bibliographic coupling network , edge - reduction is based on papers with weighted similarity scores two standard deviations above the median similarity among non - isolates in the network . Node color represents each paper’s identified bibliographic coupling community using the Newman - Girvan algorithm [ 26 ] . Panels B and C present the same analyses limited only to publications from AIDS and JAIDS respectively . Panel D show the correspondence between communities and the broad ‘‘discipline’’ like labels applied to all published articles beginning in 1998 . Color represents whether a label is over ( blue ) or under ( red ) represented in a given community according permutation - based residuals . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0115092 . g001 Bibliographic Coupling in HIV / AIDS Research PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0115092 December 15 , 2014 4 / 13 Third , since the content of science is also essential to understanding interdisciplinarity , we generate a topic model for the abstract texts in the corpus . Topic models consist of a class of techniques that locate structure in unstructured text corpora [ 33 , 34 ] . They ‘‘reverse engineer’’ the writing process to uncover latent themes within the corpus that underlie the generative processes for producing each document [ 35 ] . While several alternatives and specifications exist [ 35 , 36 ] , we use latent dirichlet allocation ( LDA ) as implemented by lda 1 . 3 . 2 in R [ 36 ] . LDA is a Bayesian approach to modeling language that assumes that texts consist of a distribution of hidden themes or topics . We empirically identify a fixed number of topics ( k 5 30 , see S1 Figure and S1 Table for more details ) , but the distribution of topics over abstracts is not fixed . A topic consists of a distribution of words , here a dirichlet distribution . LDA presents several advantages over alternatives . First , as a hierarchical model , LDA consists of three levels : the corpus , the document , and the word . Second , and most importantly for our discussion , documents do not have to be assigned to single topics . Operationally , abstracts can be assigned with proportional probabilities to multiple topics [ 35 ] . Fourth , we compare how readily these topics are contained within or bridge across the identified bibliographic coupling communities . We do this with residual contingency analyses for categorical independence , which we visualize with mosaic plots [ 37 ] . A random distribution of topics over clusters ( neither over - nor under - representation across clusters ) suggests that clustering is not at all topic - related . Underrepresentation alone can help identify topics that are not salient for the development of particular bibliographic coupling clusters , while consolidation is marked by topics with high over - representation in one cluster and underrepresentation in others . Lastly , those single topics that are over - represented in multiple clusters lack integration in that the same topics are being covered in clusters that are not drawing upon the same literatures to develop ideas within them – i . e . , are more multidisciplinarily organized . In combination , these approaches allow us to identify how segmented or consolidated the HIV / AIDS research field is , and how disciplinary boundaries contribute to that structuring , in part by identifying which topics are well - bounded within single research communities versus those that span across several . Moreover , by examining how this alignment shifts across the observed window , we can identify whether and how patterns of integration differ for ‘‘resolved’’ research questions compared to ‘‘open’’ questions . To do this , we compute community detection solutions and the correspondence analyses for the collapsed complete corpus ( i . e . , including all papers within a single analytic corpus ) , and separately over a series of moving windows that capture relevant ‘‘epistemic periods . ’’ These moving windows are labeled by the year at the end of the window and extend backwards for 4 years , which represents the median citation age within this corpus ; ‘‘Citation age’’ is the difference ( in years ) between the date of the citing paper’s publication and the year of publication for each of its cited references [ 38 ] . Bibliographic Coupling in HIV / AIDS Research PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0115092 December 15 , 2014 5 / 13 Results Networks in the Complete Corpus First , we present the bibliographic coupling based communities identified for the complete 20 - year window collapsed into a single network . Fig . 1 visualizes the community identifications for the complete network ( Panel A ) , and separately for AIDS and JAIDS ( Panels B and C , respectively ) . The network is clustered into distinct communities ( modularity 5 0 . 469 ) , and is dominated by three primary communities ( colored red , blue and yellow respectively ) , with several smaller communities that are peripheral to one of those 3 ( 6 , colored orange , is peripherally connected to 3 ) or two of those larger communities ( 4 , magenta , and 5 , green , are peripheral to 1 – 2 and 2 – 3 , respectively ) . As of 1999 , both journals introduced article classifications of ‘‘Basic , ’’ ‘‘Clinical’’ or ‘‘Social and Epidemiological’’ Sciences , which were applied to the vast majority of subsequently , published articles . The correspondence between the three largest bibliographic coupling network communities and these broad ‘‘discipline’’ like labels is pronounced ( presented in Panel D ) - with each community dominated by one such label ( as marked by its overrepresentation and the substantial underrepresentation of both of the others 1 , Clinical , 2 , Basic , 3 , Social / Epidemiological ) . The identified discipline - based arrangement of communities is not dependent on which community solution is used . A 3 - community solution was also identified which only exacerbates this pattern . Similarly , solutions with larger numbers of communities were nested within those presented , i . e . , making finer divisions within , not bridging across the discipline - based communities . The emergent communities based on citation overlaps provide initial indication of the persistence of disciplinary boundaries based on the broad categorizations—basic , clinical , and social / epidemiological scientific—within this cross - sectional view . A dynamic approach that considers topic consolidation complicates this initial overview . Next we ask how these observed communities account for primary drivers of the modularity between HIV / AIDS research areas . The article labels mentioned above hint at some of those bases ( i . e . , somewhat determined by a ‘‘disciplinary’’ orientation ) , but to formalize this further , we examine how readily the bibliographic coupling community structure corresponds with the 30 identified topics that summarize the content of HIV / AIDS research ( see S2 Figure for more information on topic labeling ) . Seventeen topics were comparatively ‘‘consoli - dated’’ ( i . e . , highly represented in only 1 community ) , which is consistent with an interdisciplinary approach ( e . g . , drug metabolism is consolidated in Cluster 1 – the red cluster in Fig . 1 that is more associated with clinical research , while vaccine development is consolidated in Cluster 2 / blue / basic science ; for a complete list of the consolidated topics , see S3 Figure ) . Fig . 2 presents a mosaic plot representing correspondence for those 13 topics that are spread over more than 1 community ( see S3 Figure for the correspondence of all 30 topics ) . For example , ‘‘ARV3’’ is a topic about toxicities in clinical trials for antiretrovirals ( ARV ) , which is significantly represented in Bibliographic Coupling in HIV / AIDS Research PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0115092 December 15 , 2014 6 / 13 clusters 2 ( blue ) and 4 ( magenta ) , and ‘‘ARV2 , ’’ a topic about ARV treatment adherence , which is present in 1 ( red ) and 4 . This split of single topics across multiple non - overlapping communities thus indicates those topics potentially least coordinated across disciplinary boundaries and , thus , characterized more by multidisciplinarity . The two topics that are evenly distributed across most / all communities provide a meaningful null - result check on the questions here – i . e . , by identifying topics that are universally salient ( e . g . , ‘‘Methods 2’’ which is comprised of language describing measurement and research methods ) . The Evolution of Research Communities & Topics It is potentially problematic to consider two decades of HIV / AIDS research as a single corpus . The field has advanced rapidly since these journals were founded in 1988 / 9 and clustering may have evolved across the observed period . Fig . 3 shows how the bibliographic coupling network’s modularity changes across the observed period . Furthermore , this evolution may help to identify temporal patterns that are associated with consensus regarding resolved and / or open questions in the HIV / AIDS research field . The first noteworthy pattern in Fig . 3 is the general trend of increasing modularity – representing higher segregation of research communities at the end of the period than the beginning . Second , this general pattern is abruptly interrupted with a sharp decrease in both journals following the 1999 introduction of discipline - like labels . This raises an important point about modularity maximization . It is simultaneously capturing two dimensions - the Fig . 2 . Community - Topic ( lack of ) Correspondence . This mosaic plot shows those topics that are overrepresented present in more than one network community ( top 11 ) , or are not consolidated in any community ( bottom 2 ) . The topics are derived via LDA ( see Supplementary Information ) and the communities are those represented in Fig . 1 . Color represents over ( blue ) and under ( red ) representation of a topic in a given community according to permutation - based residuals . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0115092 . g002 Bibliographic Coupling in HIV / AIDS Research PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0115092 December 15 , 2014 7 / 13 number of communities in the network and the degree to which those communities account for the tie - structure within / between them . The substantial dip following 1999 is driven more by a reduction in the number of salient communities , not a decrease in how segmentation exists between those communities . Third , across most of the window , modularity scores in AIDS and JAIDS are closely aligned , with changes in JAIDS lagging behind those in AIDS for roughly the first half of the period , but happening more simultaneously for the latter half . Moving to how the bibliographic coupling aligns with the substantive content of the field over time , Fig . 4 shows the temporal evolution of the clusters across 5 - year moving windows , overlaid with the correspondence between those clusters and the broad ‘‘discipline’’ - like labels . In any given labeled year , the diagram presents the bibliographic clustering identified communities ( bars ) for the moving window ending in that year . Between each year , the ‘‘flows’’ between bars indicate the re - arrangement of clusters across the period , with some clusters emerging from the merger of others ( see bottom cluster in 2008 ) , others splitting into separate clusters ( see the second cluster from the bottom in 2007 splitting across 2 in 2008 , and still others remaining relatively consistently comprised ( see the top cluster in 2007 – 08 ) . This diagram allows us to see how the ( re - ) arrangement of communities progressed through time . Additionally , by overlaying these changes with the ‘‘discipline’’ like labels from above ( which is represented by colors beginning in 2001 ) , we can see what accounts for the structure and dynamics of the changing clustering patterns ( see S4 and S5 Figures for the corresponding moving window mosaic plots for broad Fig . 3 . Temporal change in modularity , 1988 – 2008 . Constructed networks comprise all articles published in a 4 - year moving window ( with labeled year indicating the ending year of that window ) . For each temporal slice , community detection is applied , and the summary modularity index is presented . The 1998 dip follows the introduction of ‘‘discipline’’ like labels for on all published articles . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0115092 . g003 Bibliographic Coupling in HIV / AIDS Research PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0115092 December 15 , 2014 8 / 13 ‘‘discipline’’ like labels and topics , respectively ) . Much of the rearrangement between clusters after the implementation of these labels happened within ( rather than across ) those broad categories ( see the rearrangement among the various red clusters ) , with one notable exception . In the early 2000 s , clusters dominated by ‘‘Basic Science’’ join with and become marked primarily by ‘‘Social / Epidemiological Science’’ ( see the transition from blue to yellow near the top of the figure ) . Then in the mid - / late - 2000 s , new clusters dominated by ‘‘Basic Science’’ emerge from small parts of clusters driven separately by ‘‘Clinical’’ and ‘‘Social / Epidemiological’’ sciences . The dominant pattern in the latter period however is the relative consistency of the clusters that are predominantly Social / Epidemiologically oriented ( top / yellow ) and those that are predominantly Clinical oriented ( bottom / red ) . Discussion and Implications The high segmentation within the field of HIV / AIDS research is not surprising . In fact , the early period of relative interdisciplinary consolidation is an uncommon pattern among scientific fields . The more important question , therefore , is to identify the primary drivers of the identified community structure and how it Fig . 4 . Alluvial Flow Diagram w / ‘‘Discipline’’ Like Labels . This figure presents the evolution of clusters within 5 - year moving windows ( reduced to include only clusters containing at least 50 papers ) . The color corresponds to clusters in which the broad ‘‘discipline’’ - like labels are over - represented in a given community ( yellow 5 Social / Epidemiological , blue 5 Basic , red 5 Clinical ) . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0115092 . g004 Bibliographic Coupling in HIV / AIDS Research PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0115092 December 15 , 2014 9 / 13 evolves over time . The approach presented here however suggests two potential problems with considering the general question of how interdisciplinary HIV / AIDS research is as a field . First , the patterns change substantially over time , and second , the patterns tending more towards multi - or inter - disciplinary integration also differ substantially by topics . Broadly , what we found in the dynamics of the field as a whole is one that progressed from more interdisciplinary clustering early in the period—highly consolidated , with researchers bridging across disciplinary boundaries to interact around topical themes—to more multidisciplinary clustering later in the period— where researchers from a variety of disciplines are contributing to the field , but are doing so in a way that engages literatures with others from their ( cognate ) disciplines , regardless of the topic . The differences in topics’ distributions across these clusters are also informative . Some topics retained a relatively consistent pattern over the evolving clustering structure ( e . g . , vaccine development has remained a relatively consolidated topic throughout , largely within a cluster dominated by basic science research ) , others remained within a single consolidated cluster , but the disciplinary composition of that cluster changed through time ( e . g . , the cluster containing research on the HIV - testing assays evolved from being aligned with basic science early in the period to being predominantly social / epidemiological science later in the period - a transition likely consistent with a move from development to use of such tests ) . Others became more consolidated over time ( e . g . , molecular strategies for replication blocking of the HIV virus ) , or remained distributed over multiple communities ( e . g . , research on treatment failures , especially deriving from developed drug resistance ) . While the description above has largely focused on field - level organizational dynamics , the reality is that these patterns are the result of individual - ( or research team ) level research processes . Those topics marked by consolidation suggest areas where research content drives the literature ( s ) upon which authors draw in formulating ideas and developing projects . For others ( e . g . , ARV adherence and drug resistance ) , it appears that disciplinary boundaries are more likely to shape knowledge production - potentially missing ideas that develop on the same topic , but within another cluster dominated by other disciplines . This leads to the potential of missing key ideas that develop in other ( disciplinary ) portions of the literature . In sum , the general pattern within HIV / AIDS research is one increasingly marked by disciplinary segmentation rather than integration , while particular topics vary considerably in how closely they adhere to that overall pattern . The trajectory of interdisciplinary research , such as found in the HIV / AIDS field , is not predetermined . We cannot know from the outset whether a knowledge project will grow more interdisciplinary or will shrink back into disciplinary boundaries . This ambiguity is even more pronounced when considering research fields with heavy investments as various key players may have incentives to prevent or expand integration . The models employed here provide a Bibliographic Coupling in HIV / AIDS Research PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0115092 December 15 , 2014 10 / 13 means for examining the multidimensional and dynamic processes that enable evaluation of progress within interdisciplinary frameworks .
