Can Stimuli Improve Business Model Idea Generation ? Developing Software - Based Tools for Business Model Innovation Abstract A business model describes the mechanisms whereby a firm creates , delivers , and captures value . Following the steadily growing interest in business model innovation , software tools have shown great potential in supporting business model development and innovation . Yet , understanding the cognitive processes involved in the generation of business model ideas is an aspect of software design - knowledge that has so far been neglected . To investigate whether providing stimuli – in this case , brainstorming questions – can enhance individual creativity in this context , we conduct an exploratory experiment with over 100 participants . Our study is the first to systematically investigate the process of idea generation using a software - based business model development tool with stimuli . Our preliminary findings have the potential to support the future development of business model development tools and to refine the research design used to evaluate such tools .

Business model innovation ( BMI ) complements more traditional dimensions of innovation such as product , process , and organizational innovation [ 17 ] . The interest in BMI is intense and growing – from researchers and practitioners alike . BMI is a creative task [ 6 , 7 ] and prior research has found that such tasks can benefit from being supported by software tools [ 10 – 12 ] . Despite the intense and growing interest as well as the potential of such tools , currently the predominant way in which BMs are being developed is through paper - based tools , such as the Business Model Canvas [ 21 ] . The Business Model Canvas has become the quasi - standard for representing BMs [ 24 ] . It comes in form of a visual template in which a BM is described using sticky notes which can be moved around freely and are assigned to a component ( e . g . , asset sales , usage fees , or subscription fees , to describe the revenue stream of a firm’s BM ) . Given the creative nature of BMI and the success of paper - based tools like the Business Model Canvas , software - based business model development tools ( BMDTs ) are seen as having great potential to support their users in innovating BMs [ 6 , 22 , 28 ] . However , BMDTs are still in their infancy and a large part of their potential remains untapped . We found evidence for this in our systematic review of BMDTs in an earlier study [ 26 ] where the software has been used merely as an electronic whiteboard or , in the words of Chen [ 4 ] and Young [ 30 ] , at a secretarial level . While these tools have functions that , among others , allow to represent , share , annotate , and version BMs , they fall short of those suggested by Lubart [ 15 ] as being able to facilitate “the creative act through integrated human - computer cooperation during idea production” [ 15 , p . 365 ] . At the same time , design science research lacks appropriate designs with which to purposefully evaluate different functions of BMDTs – or , in the words of this year’s conference theme – to be able to assess the “transformational impact that human and computational aspects of creativity can have” . This study , once completed , will make theoretical and practical contributions towards the following : First , to the best of our knowledge , we are the first to propose a BMDT that is actively involved in BM idea generation - in contrast to previous attempts which sought to merely replicate the sticky note experience from paper - based tools to software - based tools . Moreover , our software seeks to enhance the creative process by providing stimuli . Second , we offer an experimental design that seeks to rigorously evaluate one particular function of a BMDT ( i . e . , explicitly requested and proactively provided stimuli in a form of brainstorming questions ) and thereby deliberately do not compare “tool” vs . “no - tool” . Third , we report the experiences and preliminary results of an implementation of an active BMDT as part of a proposed experimental design . We thus support practitioners’ decision making on tool ( re - ) design as stimuli are yet not implemented in such tools , and support researchers by laying foundation for a cumulative stream of research on BMDTs . Furthermore , on a more abstract level , this study seeks connecting the rich body of knowledge on creativity support systems to the recent progress in BM research . As a consequence , the goal of this study is to respond to calls from scholars and practitioners by addressing the following research question : Session : Poster & Demo Reception CC ’19 , June 23 – 26 , 2019 , San Diego , CA , USA 548 In a software - based tool for business model innovation , can idea generation be improved by the use of stimuli ? Theoretical background Search for Ideas in Associative Memory ( SIAM ) When individuals try to generate ideas to solve creative tasks that are complex , ill - structured , and / or wicked in nature - such as generating a creative BM - they search their memory for existing knowledge [ 29 ] . Applied to the context of BMI , individuals search their memory for relevant knowledge , for example , BMs they may have experienced as a customer or developed in the past . As a theoretical foundation for investigating the research question , we use the Search for Ideas in Associative Memory ( SIAM ) model . This model has already been employed to explain the effects of other software - based cognitive stimulation tools [ 1 , 14 ] and is based on well - accepted cognitive psychology assumptions [ 23 ] . SIAM posits a cognitive model with two different memory systems from which individuals can retrieve knowledge : long - term memory or working memory . While long - term memory is permanent and has unlimited capacity , working memory is temporary and has limited capacity . According to SIAM , knowledge is structured as a highly interconnected multi - level network of images which in turn are composed of concepts as well as relations that link images and concepts ( see Figure 1 ) . These images form a network of knowledge that is characterized by fuzzy boundaries , overlapping parts and mutual associations [ 14 ] . According to SIAM , the idea generation process of an individual involves two phases : a knowledge activation phase and an idea generation phase [ 20 ] . In the former , individuals activate and retrieve relevant existing knowledge from long - term memory . This means that knowledge is temporarily transferred from long - term memory to working memory . In the latter phase , individuals make use of knowledge now available in working memory ( i . e . , by applying images to a new domain ) and recombine it in novel and unusual ways ( i . e . , by forming new relations between images ) . Knowledge that is already transferred to working memory is likely to be employed again for idea generation . Therefore , stimuli can be consciously used to transfer new knowledge to working memory and thus enable new ( re - ) combinations to be made . Applied to the development of BMDTs , the use of stimuli to help generate ideas for BMs could be very valuable , but their effectiveness has not yet been researched . Type of stimuli Exposing individuals to stimuli has been found to trigger the activation and retrieval of new knowledge that would not have been available otherwise . Thus stimuli might be able to improve the generation of creative ideas [ 10 ] by eliciting additional knowledge which is temporarily transferred to working memory and thus facilitates the application and recombination of creative ideas [ 18 ] . Such stimuli can be in the form of words , sentences , pictures , or any combination of these . While working on creative tasks , individuals tend to leverage the solution space only to a limited extent and rarely reaching beyond their knowledge networks . Furthermore , the solution space of creative tasks tends to be very broad given the infinitely large number of potential solutions . It is important to note that the aim of stimuli in BMI is not to make users search the entire solution space , but merely to increase the range of alternative potential solutions they will actively draw upon ( see Figure 2 ) . In the context of BMI , stimuli are Figure 1 .

This is incredibly important , because the kinds of innovative BMs that are successful typically do not follow established or traditional value creation , value delivery , and value capturing mechanisms [ 27 ] . Timing of stimuli To help individuals activate and retrieve new knowledge for idea generation , it has been found that providing stimuli is not sufficient per se but their timing and how they are provided are crucial too . The two main differences are between explicitly requested stimuli , and proactively provided stimuli . Providing stimuli only when users explicitly request them has the advantage of users being receptive to them , but the disadvantage that they might choose suboptimal strategies for requesting stimuli or be unaware that they are stuck in ( or biased by ) traditional BMs . In the second scenario , stimuli are provided when users appear to be stuck . In the second scenario , we used a simple timeout mechanism : when no new sticky note was inserted in the BMDT for a fixed period of time , the BMDT automatically provided a new stimulus [ 25 ] . Building upon this theoretical background of creative processes , we hypothesize that stimuli in BMDTs support individuals with generating more creative ( i . e . , more novel and useful combinations of BM components ) ideas , compared to unaided individuals . Exploratory Experiment This study employs a 1x4 between - subjects experimental design which seeks to investigate whether individuals working on a BM may benefit from creativity - inducing BMDTs . Participants In contrast to the vast majority of tasks in prior idea generation experiments , our task required some prior knowledge of BMs without which participants would otherwise have been unable to meaningfully work on a BM idea generation task . This made the selection of suitable participants more difficult . We were provided with the opportunity to recruit 118 bachelor students enrolled in a course “Methods for developing digital business models” at Paderborn University . The experiment took place shortly before the end of the semester , during which time the students learned to systematically analyze BMs . ‘Active’ Business Model Development Tool For the controlled experiment we implemented a BMDT that enables us to realize and control the experiment conditions ( see Figure 3 ) . The active BMDT is characterized by mainly three functions replicating the typical use of the Business Model Canvas : Creating , moving , and deleting a sticky note . Procedure On entering the room , each participant was given a code and a seat number . Participants were seated in such a way that they could not talk to each other or see each other’s screens . Logging in to the BMDT with the code , participants were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions . The procedure comprised three stages : 1 ) Task induction ( 10 min ) : to familiarize themselves with the task , participants were given a brief introduction to read , which summarized the BM concept and the nine components of the Business Model Canvas ; 2 ) Task processing ( 30 min ) : participants developed a new BM ; 3 ) Questionnaire ( 20 min ) : participants were required to complete a post - Figure 2 .

Task The BM idea generation task is based on the “improving an ailing donut franchise” business case [ 16 ] , which had previously been used to study the effects of software - based cognitive stimulation tools [ 1 ] . We adapted the business case for the purpose of BMI . The description of the task included a short description of the current situation of the donut franchise . Participants were asked to innovate the existing BM of the donut franchise ( i . e . , generate a new BM idea ) . Stimuli As stimuli we use so called “What - if” brainstorming questions which had been tried and tested in workshops , coaching , and accelerator programs by Board of Innovation , an international innovation consultancy [ 3 ] . In the experiment we use a set of six BM - specific questions which addressed at least two components of the Business Model Canvas . The sequence and number of stimuli displayed are the same for the treatment conditions . Since there is virtually no knowledge on how to design BMDTs and certainly none about creativity - inducing functions such as stimuli , we follow previous research and distinguish between four different conditions [ 25 ] for implementing the BMDT : On - demand ( T1 ) , where participants can request a stimulus whenever they want . On - idle ( T2 ) , where participants are automatically presented with a stimulus when no sticky note has been added to the BM for 2 . 5 minutes . On - interval ( T3 ) : Participants see a stimulus at the beginning of the task and thereafter a new stimulus at 5 - minute intervals . None ( C0 ) , where participants are not given any stimulus while generating BM ideas . Discussion of preliminary results Given the early stage of this research - in - progress we discuss our preliminary results with a view to assessing , further developing and strengthening the BMDT and the experimental design . In analyzing the creative potential of BMDTs , we found some interesting , but as yet not statistically relevant , trends in these early results , and hence are able to report only descriptive statistics ( see Table 1 ) . Twelve of the 118 participants were excluded from the analysis due to not having fully completed the experiment . We controlled for age , gender , study program , semester , prior knowledge of BMs and the Business Model Canvas , and domain knowledge ( i . e . , donuts ) . To find out whether stimuli in BMDTs support individuals with generating BM ideas , we asked users to rate their perception of the following on a 7 - level Likert scale : 1 ) the difficulty / ease with which they considered different ideas ( for which we used the exploration item from the Creativity Support Index [ 5 ] ) ; 2 ) the helpfulness of stimuli provided , and 3 ) the interruption to their creative thinking process caused by the stimulus ( for which we used the process disfluency item [ 19 ] ) . In addition , users rated 4 ) the perceived creativity of their BM idea [ 7 ] and 5 ) their willingness to adopt that BM idea [ 7 ] ( see Table 1 ) . Overall , stimuli in BMDTs were perceived as helpful by individuals in the treatment conditions ( T1 - T3 ) who felt on average more capable of exploring creative BM ideas compared to individuals in the control condition ( C0 ) . However , from the qualitative feedback we learned that the way stimuli are currently implemented in the BMDT C0 T1 T2 T3 1 ) Exploration item of the Creativity Support Index [ 5 ] 4 , 74 5 , 16 5 , 07 5 , 33 2 ) Perceived helpfulness of stimuli - 4 , 18 4 , 21 4 , 09 3 ) Processing disfluency [ 19 ] - 4 , 26 4 , 57 4 , 65 4 ) Perceived creativity of a business model idea [ 7 ] 4 , 96 4 , 57 4 , 68 4 , 65 5 ) Willingness to adopt a business model idea [ 7 ] 5 , 85 5 , 29 5 , 64 5 , 87 Table 1 : Preliminary results of the exploratory experiment . Means self - reported by experiment participants based on Likert - scales . Session : Poster & Demo Reception CC ’19 , June 23 – 26 , 2019 , San Diego , CA , USA 551 inhibits individuals to fully leverage such stimuli . On the one hand , participants reported that stimuli “give food for thought” , make them “question their own business model ideas” , “undoubtedly increase motivation” , and “opened up new horizons” . On the other hand , they reported that stimuli “sometimes do not fit to [ their ] own business model idea” and asked for “more guidance on how to make the best possible use” of stimuli . In addition , the provision of stimuli was perceived as disruptive to varying degrees . On average , individuals in the on - demand condition ( T1 ) were least disrupted . This is not surprising , but there were also noticeable differences in how stimuli were used . Participants ( in condition T1 ) who had requested several stimuli in a comparatively short space of time ( typically within the first 15 minutes ) reported the most difficulties in using the stimuli to their advantage . We know from the logfiles that participants had given themselves little time to draw inspiration from each stimulus before requesting a new one , which made applying a stimulus to one’s own BM rather difficult . This suggests that , for the advancement of the experimental design and the BMDT , the on - demand provision of stimuli should be more controlled , for example by imposing a delay between stimuli to ensure that users are exposed to them for a minimum period of time . Interestingly , compared with the other experimental conditions , individuals in the on - demand condition ( T1 ) showed the lowest perceived levels of creativity and willingness to adopt BMs despite being given the greatest control over stimuli . We suggest to investigate whether the perceived and the actual creativity of BM ideas differ when using BMDTs and stimuli . Conclusion and future research Research on BMDTs still is in its infancy and a large part of the potential of this new class of creativity support system remains untapped . For the further refinement of experimental designs , we suggest three possible design foci for future work : First , experiments could use additional metrics for evaluating ideation [ 13 ] such as experts’ ratings on the outcome of BM idea generation with a BMDT ( e . g . , through Consensual Assessment Technique [ 2 ] ) , rather than users’ cognitive processes . Second , experimental designs could encourage participants to generate more than one BM idea , as previous research found that developing more ideas increases the likelihood of more creative ideas being generated [ 9 ] . Third , in the long term , it is conceivable to incorporate stimuli into BMDTs to promote individual and collaborative creativity , which would require the experiment’s design to reflect the wider social context in which the creative process and product are situated [ 8 ] . With this study , we intend to take the first step towards developing active and creativity - inducing BMDTs and to promote the maturity of BMDTs and their evaluation in the form of controlled experiments . While the preliminary results did not yet yield any significant results , the experimental design was found potentially useful for other purposes . After additional discussion , we plan to execute the experiment with a revised and refined experimental design . This would allow us to methodologically augment creativity support systems for complex mental models in strategic management in general , and BM research in particular . Our purpose is to not only improve BMDTs , but also to contribute to research on software - based cognitive stimulation tools .
