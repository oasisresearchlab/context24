WAVE2 , a protein related to Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein , is crucial for Rac - induced membrane rufﬂing , which is important in cell motility 1 – 4 . Cell movement is essential for morphogenesis , but it is unclear how cell movement is regulated or related to morphogenesis . Here we show the physiological functions of WAVE2 by disruption of the WAVE2 gene in mice . WAVE2 was expressed predominantly in vascular endothelial cells during embryogenesis . WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos showed haemorrhages and died at about embryonic day 10 . Deﬁciency in WAVE2 had no signiﬁcant effect on vasculogenesis , but it decreased sprouting and branching of endothelial cells from existing vessels during angiogenesis . In WAVE2 2 / 2 endothelial cells , cell polarity formed in response to vascular endothelial growth factor , but the formation of lamellipodia at leading edges and capillaries was severely impaired . These ﬁndings indicate that WAVE2 - regulated actin reorganization might be required for proper cell movement and that a lack of functional WAVE2 impairs angiogenesis in vivo . When a cell moves , the actin cytoskeleton is reorganized , and protrusive membrane structures such as lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia are formed at the leading edge 5 . These structures generate the locomotive force in migrating cells . Production of phosphatidyl - inositol - 3 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate ( PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) by the activation of phosphatidylinositol - 3 - OH kinase in response to chemoattractants is reported to be required for the formation of cell polarity and a leading edge 6 , 7 . Accumulation of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 stimulates Rho - family small GTPases such as Rac and Cdc42 , leading to the formation of a leading edge . Rho - family small GTPases are thought to regulate actin reorganization 8 . Rac and Cdc42 regulate the formation of lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia , respectively . Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) - family proteins are key regula - tors that link extracellular stimuli to actin reorganization 9 . To investigate the role of WAVE2 in cell migration and mouse development , we generated WAVE2 - deﬁcient mice by homologous recombination ( Fig . 1a ; Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . Mice heterozygous for the WAVE2 mutation were healthy and fertile . By embryonic day 10 ( E10 ) , mendelian ratios of wild - type , heterozygous and homo - zygous embryos were detected ; however , there was a drastic decrease in the number of homozygotes at E10 . 25 – E10 . 5 , and no live WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos were found at E11 . 5 ( data not shown ) . These WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos did not express WAVE2 protein ( Sup - plementary Fig . S1c ) , indicating that these embryos carry a null mutation . At E8 . 5 there was no signiﬁcant difference in appearance between wild - type and WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos ; however , as develop - ment proceeded , WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos showed developmental delay and growth retardation ( compare Fig . 1b with c ) . Wild - type and WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos contained a similar number of somites at E8 . 5 letters to nature NATURE | VOL 424 | 24 JULY 2003 | www . nature . com / nature 452 © 2003 Nature PublishingGroup ( data not shown ) , but at E9 . 5 , WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos had fewer somites than did wild - type embryos ( 21 . 1 ^ 3 . 4 in wild type ; 16 . 7 ^ 3 . 3 in WAVE2 2 / 2 ; P , 0 . 05 ) . These WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos never had more than 29 somites , whereas wild - type littermates had more than 30 somites . At E10 . 5 , WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos were very fragile and occasionally had oedema of the head ( 5 % of WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos , n (cid:136) 39 ) , and the yolk sacs of WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos appeared pale with few blood cells ( data not shown ) . The hearts of WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos were small and incompletely looped com - pared with their wild - type littermates ( compare Fig . 1d with e ) , and dilation of the pericardial cavities was apparent ( Fig . 1e , black arrowhead ) . In many cases ( 57 % of WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos , n (cid:136) 28 ) , the WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos had haemorrhages in the head regions , pericardial cavities , hearts and ventral parts of the trunk ( Fig . 1e , white arrowheads ) . WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos died at about E10 , possibly because of haemorrhage or oedema of the heart , indicating that WAVE2 is required for normal embryonic development . During early development , WAVE2 expression was detected preferentially in dorsal aortas and ingrowths into the neural tube ( Fig . 1f ) and was coincident with the expression of platelet – endothelial cell adhesion molecule ( PECAM ) , which was used as an endothelial marker ( Fig . 1g , h ) , but not a - smooth muscle actin ( data not shown ) . Similarly , WAVE2 was produced in endocardial cells but not in the myocardial layer ( Fig . 1i – k ) . No signal was detected in identical experiments with WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos ( data not shown ) . In contrast , WAVE1 was enriched in neural tubes but not in vascular endothelial cells ( Fig . 1l – n ) . WAVE3 was not detected during this developmental stage ( data not shown ) . WAVE2 was the only WAVE family protein that was preferentially expressed in endothelial cells during the early stages of development . During embryogenesis , the cardiovascular system develops through a series of complex events 10 . The development of embryo - nic vasculature takes place through two distinct processes : vasculo - genesis and angiogenesis . During vasculogenesis , the primitive vascular plexus was formed almost normally in WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos with 18 somites ( Fig . 2a – d ; Supplementary Fig . S2a – e ) . The intersomitic vessels of WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos were also formed , although they were slightly disorganized in comparison with those of wild - type embryos ( compare Fig . 2c with d , white arrowheads ; Supplementary Fig . S2f ) . During angiogenesis , in the yolk sacs of WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos with 22 somites , the primary capillary plexus was remodelled and the larger vessels—the vitelline arteries and veins—were formed ( Fig . 2e , f , large arrowhead ; Supplementary Fig . S2b ) , but other capillaries were much smaller than those of wild - type embryos and were occasionally discontinuous ( Fig . 2f , small arrowheads ; Sup - plementary Fig . S2b ) . In the heads of WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos with 22 somites , the larger vessels did not develop appropriately ( compare Fig . 2g with h , large and small arrowheads ; Supplementary Fig . S2a ) , and the head capillaries were less dense and branched in WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos than in wild - type embryos with the same number of somites ( Supplementary Fig . S2d ) . In addition , the capillary net - work was occasionally disrupted ( Fig . 2h , arrows ) . The major vessels of the trunk region , such as the dorsal aorta and anterior cardinal vein , were relatively small in WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos ( compare Fig . 2i with j , black arrowhead and arrow ; Supplementary Fig . S2c ) . In addition , in some WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos ( 33 . 3 % of WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos , n (cid:136) 12 ) with 22 somites , the intersomitic vessels seemed disorganized ( compare Fig . 2i with j , white arrowheads ) . Moreover , angiogenic sprouting was inhibited at the most dorsal part of the somites and the neural tube of WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos and in the labyrinthine region of WAVE2 2 / 2 placentas ( Fig . 2i – p ; Supplemen - tary Fig . S2g ) . Thus , angiogenic remodelling and sprouting did not take place correctly in WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos , yolk sacs and placentas .

In addition , similarly to vascular development , endothelial lineage in the heart showed abnormal development , but myocardial walls were rela - tively normal in WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos ( Supplementary Fig . S3 ) . Next we examined the angiogenic properties of WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos in a para - aortic splanchnopleural ( P - Sp ) culture sys - tem 11 , 12 . In this culture system , PECAM - positive cells from explants of E9 . 5 embryos formed a sheet - like structure ( vascular bed ) and subsequently a network structure ( vascular network ) ( Fig . 2s ) . Vasculogenesis in the P - Sp culture system has been deﬁned as the process of formation of a vascular bed , and angiogenesis as the subsequent process that forms a vascular network , because Tie2 expression is low in endothelial cells of a vascular bed and high in those of a vascular network 11 , 12 . In P - Sp cultures from WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos , vascular beds , but not vascular networks , were formed ( compare Fig . 2s with t ; Supplementary Fig . S2h ) . Our collective results indicate that the WAVE2 - null mutation impairs angiogenesis even in this in vitro culture system . Impaired vessel formation in WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos would therefore be the primary effect of disruption of WAVE2 in endothelial cells . To understand the cellular basis of the endothelial defects in WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos , we used electron microscopy to examine the mutant embryonic vessels and hearts . The endothelial cells in the aorta and head capillaries of WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos were ﬂatter than cells from wild - type embryos ( compare Fig . 3a , c with b , d , respectively ; Supplementary Fig . S2j ) . Surprisingly , WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos showed some gaps in the vascular endothelial cells of head capillaries and in endothelium of the heart ( compare Fig . 3c , e , g , i with d , f , h , j , respectively ; Supplementary Fig . S2k , l ) . Scanning photomicrographs clearly conﬁrmed these defects in endothelial cells , and leaking erythrocytes were visible ( Fig . 3f ) . However , the structures of cell – cell junctions between neighbouring endothelial cells ( Fig . 3a – d , arrowheads ) , the recruitment of peri - endothelial cells and the interaction between endothelial cells and their sur - rounding cells were normal in appearance ( Fig . 3a , b , arrows ) , indicating that these gaps might be formed before the formation of junctions . In addition , fewer membrane protrusions were present in the head capillary vessels of WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos than in those of wild - type embryos ( compare Fig . 3c , e with d , f , respectively ) . Collectively , electron microscopic analysis revealed several defects in the morphology of endothelial cells in WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos , the presence of which probably explains the haemorrhages and oedema observed in the head and heart .

We conﬁrmed that endothelial cells were properly isolated from both wild - type and WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos by immunoﬂuorescent analysis with anti - PECAM and anti - Tie2 antibodies ( data not shown ) and polymerase chain reac - tion with reverse transcription ( Supplementary Fig . S4a ) . In wild - type endothelial cells , WAVE2 expression was higher than in control cells ( Supplementary Fig . S4a ) , and was markedly higher at E9 . 5 than at E8 . 5 ( Fig . 4a , b ) . In contrast , the expression of WAVE1 and N - WASP , the genes encoding the other WASP - family proteins involved in tubulogenesis 13 , was slightly greater at E9 . 5 than at E8 . 5 . We further examined actin reorganization in isolated endothelial cells by treatment with vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) for 10min . About 85 % of wild - type endothelial cells responded to VEGF with peripheral membrane rufﬂes , but few ( less than 10 % ) WAVE2 2 / 2 endothelial cells had peripheral membrane rufﬂes as judged by staining of actin ﬁlaments ( Fig . 4c ; Supplementary Fig . S4b ) . At the edge of lamellipodial structures , accumulation of WAVE2 was observed in immunoﬂuorescent analyses ( Fig . 4c ) . These results indicate that WAVE2 might be required for VEGF - induced actin ﬁlament reorganization in endothelial cells . We next examined the response of wild - type and WAVE2 2 / 2 endothelial cells to VEGF by time - lapse microscopy . VEGF was applied to cells by micropipette to produce a gradient of concen - trations of VEGF ; most endothelial cells isolated from both wild - type and WAVE2 2 / 2 embryos responded to VEGF ( Supplementary Fig . S5a – c , movies in Fig . S6a and S6b ) . About 90 % of wild - type endothelial cells responded to VEGF by extending lamellipodia ( Supplementary Fig . S5a , c ; movie in Supplementary Fig . S6a ) . In contrast , about 90 % of WAVE2 2 / 2 endothelial cells also responded to VEGF by producing tiny peripheral membrane rufﬂes ( Sup - plementary Fig . S5b , c ; movie in Supplementary Fig . S6b ) . The tiny rufﬂes responding to VEGF in WAVE2 2 / 2 endothelial cells did not persist and soon disappeared , explaining the decrease in lamellipo - dial structure formation after treatment with VEGF for 10 min ( Fig . 4c ) . When we measured the extension speed of the edge of the cell membrane , the speed of cell membrane extension responding to VEGF was greatly reduced in WAVE2 2 / 2 endothelial cells ( 0 . 0007 m m s 2 1 ) in comparison with the speed of wild - type endo - thelial cells ( 0 . 0063 m m s 2 1 ) ( Fig . 4d ) . Neither type of endothelial cell responded to control buffer ( data not shown ) . The defect in membrane extension observed in WAVE2 2 / 2 endothelial cells was restored by ectopic expression of WAVE2 fused with green ﬂuores - cent protein in a manner similar to that of wild - type endothelial cells ( Fig . 4d ; Supplementary Fig . S5d , movies in Supplementary Fig . S6c – f ) . Thus , signals upstream of WAVE2 seem to be normal in WAVE2 2 / 2 endothelial cells . Indeed , both wild - type and WAVE2 2 / 2 endothelial cells were able to induce cell polarity in response to VEGF , which were conﬁrmed by PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 production at the side facing VEGF ( Supplementary Fig . S7 ) . Collectively , WAVE2 2 / 2 endothelial cells have all the signalling components , except WAVE2 , necessary for lamellipodial protrusion . We examined whether WAVE2 2 / 2 endothelial cells showed morphological changes in capillary formation on Matrigel 14 . In this assay , endothelial cells differentiate into vascular structures ; those are necessary for sprouting and tube formation in vivo . Wild - type endothelial cells formed capillary - like structures , whereas WAVE2 2 / 2 endothelial cells did not form capillary structures as judged by the area of the cells ( Fig . 4e , f ) . When cultured on Matrigel , wild - type endothelial cells formed lamellipodial protru - sions ( Fig . 4f , arrows ) , and then migrated along neighbouring cells to form capillary structures . In contrast , lamellipodia were scarcely observed , and capillary formation was severely inhibited in WAVE2 2 / 2 endothelial cells . Thus , WAVE2 would regulate endo - thelial cell migration through the reorganization of actin during embryogenesis , resulting in the formation of a complex vascular Figure 4 Physiological functions of WAVE2 in endothelial cells . a , Analysis of gene expression of E8 . 5 and E9 . 5 endothelial cells by RT – PCR . gapdh , gene encoding glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase . b , Relative intensity levels of PCR products were measured and normalized for GAPDH levels .

We also conﬁrmed that actin reorganization induced by WAVEs is required for the migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( Supplementary Fig . S8 ) . Here we have shown that WAVE2 is essential for cardiovascular development during embryogenesis . However , we do not know the physiological function of WAVE2 in other tissues or organs . Pro - duction of a conditional knockout of WAVE2 will be helpful in solving these issues . A Methods Targeted disruption of the WAVE2 gene A mouse 129 Sv / J genomic library was screened for WAVE2 , and several fragments containing the exon including ATG were isolated . In our targeting vector ( Fig . 1a ) , a 5 . 2 - kilobaseDNAfragmentencompassingthestartcodonoftheWAVE2 - codingsequence was deleted and replaced with a neomycin - resistance minigene . The linearized targeting vector was electroporated into 129 / Ola embryonic stem cells . Two independent heterozygous embryonic stem cell clones were used to generate chimaeric mice by blastocyst injection , and mutant animals were bred on a mixed 129 / Ola £ C57BL / 6J background . Genotyping was done by Southern blotting ( Supplementary Fig . S1a ) and PCR assays ( Supplementary Fig . S1b ) . For Southern blot analysis , genomic DNAwas digested with Hin cII and hybridized with a 5 0 probe . The 5 0 probe corresponded to a 0 . 5 - kilobase Pst I – Eco RVDNAfragmentisolatedfromtheWAVE2genomicclone . Primers for PCR analysis were 5 0 - TATGGCCTGTCCACTGTGAC - 3 0 , 5 0 - TCAGATCGCAGCCC TTGCTT - 3 0 and 5 0 - CCTGTGCTCTAGTAGCTTTACG - 3 0 . Antibodies Polyclonal anti - WAVE1 , anti - WAVE2 and anti - WAVE3 antibodies were prepared in rabbits immunized with the basic regions of human WAVEs ( WAVE1 , amino acids 180 – 246 ; WAVE2 , amino acids 180 – 241 ; WAVE3 , amino acids 181 – 246 ) expressed in Escherichia coli . Monoclonal anti - PECAM - 1 antibody ( clone MEC 13 . 3 ) was from Pharmingen and antibody against anti - a - smooth muscle actin ( clone 1A4 ) was from Sigma .

Specimens were postﬁxed with 2 % osmium tetroxide for 2h , block - stained with 3 % uranyl acetate for 2h and embedded in epoxy resin . Thin sections were cut , stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Hitachi H - 800 transmission electron microscope . Observation with a scanning electron microscope was performed as described previously 16 . Isolation of endothelial cell from E9 . 5 embryos Each E9 . 5 embryo was dissected and incubated separately for 30min with 0 . 1 % collagenase ( Sigma ) in DMEM medium supplemented with 10 % FCS at 37 8 C . Cells were dispersed by pipetting and incubated for 5min with 400ngml 2 1 ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - conjugated anti - CD31 / PECAM ( MEC13 . 3 ) antibody ( Pharmingen ) at 25 8 C . Cells were then washed with PBS supplemented with 0 . 5mM EDTAand0 . 5 % BSA . Cellswereresuspendedwith100 m lPBSsupplementedwith0 . 5mM EDTA and 0 . 5 % BSAwith 10 m l anti - FITC microbeads ( magnetic beads ) ( Miltenyi Biotec GmbH ) andincubatedfor15minonice . ThesecellswereappliedtoMACSMSseparation columns on magnetic stands and washed with 1 . 5ml PBS supplemented with 0 . 5mM EDTA and 0 . 5 % BSA . The cells bound to the magnetic columnwere collected by washing the column away from the magnetic stands . Cells were cultured from one embryo in one well of a collagen - coated 96 - well plate with EGM - 2 medium and the EGM - 2 bullet kit ( Clonetics ) . Usually , more than 85 % of cells were positive for Tie2 and PECAM . RT – PCR analysis Total RNAwas isolated from endothelial cells and unisolated cells by cell sorting ( control cells ) byusingRNeasyMini ( Qiagen ) . Endothelialand controlcellswereisolatedfromE8 . 5 andE9 . 5wild - typeembryos . ReversetranscriptionwasperformedwithaThermoScriptRT – PCR System ( Invitrogen ) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions . PCR was performedwith ExTaq ( TaKaRa ) with the useofprimersets for WAVE2 , WAVE1 , N - WASP and ﬂk - 1 . RNAlevelswerestandardizedtotheglyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphatedehydrogenase gene . PCR products were stained with ethidium bromide and quantiﬁed . Time - lapse observation of endothelial cells Eight thousand cells were seeded on a collagen - coated glass bottom dish ( 14mm in diameter ) . After adhesion of cells to the dish , the medium was replaced with E - STIM endothelial culture medium containing epidermal growth factor and endothelial cell growth supplement , namely aFGF or ECGF - a ( Becton Dickinson ) , and cultured overnight . Cells were then observed under a microscope at 10 - s intervals . The sequential images were stored as a movie ﬁle of 0 . 2s per frame . AVEGF gradient was made by applying VEGF ( 1mgml 2 1 in PBS ; Sigma ) from a Femtotip on a microinjector ( Eppendorf ) at a pressure of 100hPa . Cells that responded to VEGF were deﬁned as cells with any movement of cell membrane after treatment with VEGF in the movie . No signiﬁcant change was observed in the absence of VEGF . The speed of membrane extension was calculated as the difference in position of the edge of the cell membrane between the start and the end of the movie . Capillary formation Four thousand cells were plated onto Matrigel basement membrane matrix ( BD Biosciences ) inonewellofa96 - wellplate . Afterculturingfor24hinEGM - 2mediumwith the EGM - 2 bullet kit , cells were ﬁxed , and the area composed of capillaries was measured with NIH image software .
